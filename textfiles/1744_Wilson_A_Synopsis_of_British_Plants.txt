PREFACE. 

T he principal defign in puhlifloing this 
Synopsis, is to injiru5i beginners in the 
knowledge of Britifh Plants ; efpecialLy fuch 
as are unacquainted with the Latin tongue z 
For thd* there are feveral authors^ in our own lan- 
guage^ on that fuhjebi^ yet none of them have pur- 
fued any regular method : Some difpofing the plants in 
an alphabetical order â€¢, others according to their fup- 
pofed virtues y or in fuch an unintelligible manner^ that a 
learner^ having no certain rule to direbi him^ mufi 
undergo a very tedious fearch^ before he can pojfibly 
find out hs unknown plants if he be fo happy as ta 
meet with it at all : But this difficulty will^ in a great 
meafure^ be removed^ by the regular and familiar me- 
thod which is followed in this Synopfis. And that it 
may be the more eafily underjlood^ it will be neceffiary ta 
obferve by what noteSy or properties^ plants are con- 
Jtantly known and diftinguijhedy and thereby become re- 
ducible to a certain uniform order, Fhefe are^ gen er al- 

ly y the Flowers, the Fruit, and the Seed : But Mr 
Ray, whofe model is here copiedy takes in any other 
parts that are leaf fubjebl to change or alteration \ 
but admits only of fo many as are fufficiently determi- 
natey which feldom amount to more than three ; and 
all thofe plants that have the fame parts conjlrubled 
after the like manner y however they may differ in 
other refpebiSy arey neverthelefsy difpofed of tcgether y 
which difpojinon is called a Clafs, or Tribe. JFor 
inftancey all plantSy having Pentapctalous Flowers, 
Jucceeded by two naked feeds y joined clofe together whilft 
greeny and feparated when ripey be their other parts e- 
ver fo diffimilary are ranged together y and ccnftitute 
one clafs, called Umbelliferous : And all rough leav'd 
plantSy that have their leaves placed alternately upon 



P R E F A C E; 

the ftalks^ their flowers monopetalous^ cut into five 
fegments^ and fuccÂ£eded by four naked feeds^ are like- 
wife ranged together ^ and conftitute another called 
Alperifoliate. In like manner the reft are diftinguijhed ; 
fo that in all they make up twenty-two claffes in this 
Synopfis ; and the particular properties^ or charac- 
ters^ whereby they are fever ally known ^ being prefix'd^ 
a learner^ by moderate application^ may^ in a fhort 
time^ become acquainted with thofe claffes^ and be 
able to retain them in his memory^ fo as to recollect 
them upon occafion. Bejides the notes or properties 
which afcertain each particular clafs^ there are others 
to be found in every plants which denominate the fub- 
altern genera, or kinds. For example., Angelica and 
Cowparfnip are both of the Umbelliferous tribe., each 
having a pentapetalous flower., fucc ceded by two na- 
ked feeds *5 but then there is a remarkable dijference 
between the two plants., for the leaves of the former 
are winged., and the leaves of the latter are jagged or 
finuated ; which properties diftinguijh thefe two kinds. 
Accordingly all the dijferent genera, or kinds., are digeft- 
ed under their feveralclafles^ and properly char abler fed ; 
and., after the fame manner., under every genus, all the 
different iptcits are difpofed, with fhort defcriptions to 
diftinguifh them from each other. So that when any un- 
known plant occurs., it may eaf.ly be known % for., by exa- 
mining its appearance and properties., it will readily be 
referred to its diftinbl clafs \ from whence., by obferving 
its more particular marks and charabiers., it may be traced 
to its fubaltern genus and fpecies â€¢, where it has., firft 
the name given it in Mr Rayâ€™j Synopfis, afterwards 
thofe by Cafpar Bauhine, Gerard, and Farkinfon ; and 
that thefe authors may be readily confulted for further 
information., the pages of each are inferted. And it 
muft be obferved, that in this diftribution of the plajitSy 
the third edition of Mr Rayâ€™j Synopfis is followed., 
excepting a few fuch tranfpofitions as the proper' ties., 
upon ' examination y plainly direbfed , the moft material 



PREFACE. 

vf which are: ift, *The fpecies of Fumana are placed 
with the papilionaceous tribe ; 2d, the Plantains and 
Spurges, amongft the plants having monopet alous flowers 
and dry feed-vejfels ; 3d, Lyfimachia filiquofa, Pa- 
paver corniculata, Chelidonium majus, and Balfamine, 
will he found amongji the Jiliquous, or poded plants^ 
with tetrapetalous flowers ; 4th, Luteola, with the 
vafculiferous, tetrapetalous and, 5th, Refeda, or 
Bafe Rocket, amongft the vafculiferous plants, with 
hempetalous flowers. 

As it may be ferviceable to know the places where 
plants, that are not very common, have been founds 
it was thought proper, not only to preferve thofe men-' 
tioned in Mr Rayâ€™j Synopfis, but to add fever al more-, 
being partly fuch as I met with in an authentick ma- 
nufcript, of the late Mr Lawfon, to which I have 
affixed his Name *, and partly fuch as I have had op- 
portunity to obferve myfelf, which are diftinguijhed 
by this mark f : ^e officinal and dilpenfatory plants 
have an afterijk prefix^ d, and cheir virtues are generally 
tranf crib ed from ilfr Miller â€™j Botanicum Officinale. 

nat this Synopsis might be more compleat, 
J have not fcrupled to collebl the char abler s and defcrip- 
tions from the heft Modern Authors : And as I 
have had frequent opportunities of examining moft of 
the plants my felf, I have correbled fome errors, and 
fupplied many defebls in thofe authors. The reader will 
obferve that I have entirely omitted the Fungi, Mol^ 
fes, Graffes, andl^x^t^\ which was to avoid raiftng 
the price of this volume too high, by enlarging the bulk 
of it too much : I chofe therefore to make my firft 
publick ejfay with fame diffidence, that in cafe my per- 
formance Jhould not give the expelled fatisfablion, I 
might, however, attonefor my fault, by moderating the 
expence \ defigning, if this meets with a better fate, 
and finds acceptance with the publick, to throw into 
another volume what is now left out of this.

It is hot and dry, of very fubtile volatile parts, and is pe- 
culiarly appropriated to the female fex, being a good uterine, 
provoking the menfes and lochia, expelling the birth and fecon- 
dines. 1 he juice, or a ftrong decodion of the leaves, fweet â€¢ 
enâ€™d with fugar, has been accounted a fpecifick againft the whoop-

The leaves of Henbane are emollient, cooling and anodyne; 
good for inflammations, and to flop defluftions of hot rheum; 
and are often put into cooling repelling ointments. The roots 
are accounted narcotic, and are but rarely ufed inwardly j they 
are frequently hung about children's necks, being cut to pieces, 
and ftrung like beads, to prevent fits, and caufe an eafy breed- 
ing of teeth. The feed is commended, by Mr Boyle, againfl: 
fpitting of blood, as well as any other hsemorrhage, made into 
an electuary, with conferve of Rofes, and white Poppy feeds.

The leaves of Wood-forrel are believed to excel Common 
$orrel in all phyfical virtues ; and are reckoned more cordial 
and ufeful in inflammatory fevers, quenching thirft, and allay- 
ing the heat of the ftomach ; which they llrengthen, and create 
an appetite : They help diforders of the liver, and are good 
for the dropfey and jaundice. The juice, when clarified, is of 
a fine red colour, and makes a very agreeable fyrup.
