PREFACE. 



THOUGH the Study of Botany is of late 
Years become a very general Amufe- 
nicnt in this Country, there has yet appeared no 
Work, in our own Language, that profeflcdly 
treats of the Llements ot that Science; it is 
therefore hoped, that what is now offered to the 
Public, if it Ihall appear to have been carefully 
executed, will be confidered as a Performance of 
fome Utility. The matter it contains, or at 
l?aft the far greater Part of it, will probably be 
new to the Englijh Reader; for though fome few 
Explanations of the fame Kind may be found 
interfperfed in larger Works, thefe are for the 
moft Part too coflly to fall into many Hands; 
nor could the Reader expeft to find therein 
the Whole of what he feeks, the explaining the 
Theory of the Science not having been the im- 
piediate Objeft of thofe Publications. 

T'he Matter of the following Sheets has been 

golledted from the Works of the celebrated Dr. 

1 LinnaiiS't 



vi PREFACE. 

J.hiÂ»aiis; whofe Labours for the Reformation of 
this Scien'-t' in general, and whofe Invention of 
the Sexual S\ l\cm in particular, are well known. 
As the Writings of this learned Profeflor are 
interfperfcd with philofophical and critical Re- 
marks, that are of lefs general Ufc, it was 
thought that a d.recl: Tranflation of any of his 
Works would not be fo well received, as what is 
now given; which contains an Extract of his 
mod material Docflrines. The Method in which 
thcfe have been diftributed in the following 
Chapters, we propofe to explain ; but to render 
this more intelligible, it will be expedient to 
lay before the Reader a fhort Account of thofe 
Difcovcries that have given Occafion to the 
Moulding of this Science into a Form fo dif- 
ferent from that in which it appeared in the laft 
Century. 

The Sexual S}Jlem of Botany, as Its Title im- 
ports, is founded on a Difcovery that there is 
in Vegetables, as well as in Animals, a DjftinSlion 
of the Sexes. This was not wholly unknown to 
the Ancients ; but their Knowledge of it w-as 
very imperfeft. In order to fhew in what Re- 
fpeft this Difcovery has been inveftigated far- 
ther by the Moderns, it will be ncceffary to anti- 
cipate 



PREFACE. vii 

cipate Part of the Subjedt- Matter of the follow- 
ing Chapters. 

It will be fcen in the Courfe of this Work, 
that the Flowers of the Generality of Vegetables 
are HeminphrodUe, containing within them the 
Characters of both Sexes ; but that in the Claffes 
Alonoecia and Dioecia, the Sexes are parted, and 
allotted to different Flowers ; and that in the 
Clafs Dioecia in particular, the Sexes are even on 
different Plants, the Male Flowers growing all 
upon one Plant, and the Female upon another. 
Now this laft Circunifliincc the Ancients had ob- 
ferved : indeed it could hardly efcape their No- 
tice; for the Palm-Tree, vvhofe Fruit was in 
Efteem, being of the Clafs Dioecia, a very little 
Obfervation was requifite to teach them, that 
in thefe Trees the Flowers of the Male were ne- 
ceffary to ripen the Fruit of the Female. Ac- 
cordingly we find, in the Account given by He- 
rodotus * of the Country about Babylon, where 
thefe Trees are in plenty, that it was a Cuftom 
with the Natives, in their Culture of this Plant, 
to affilt the Operations of Nature, by gathering 
the Flowers of the Male Trees, and carrying

them to the Female. By this means they fecurrd 
the Ripening of the Fruit; which might elfe, 
from unfavourable Seafons, or the want of a 
proper Intermixture of the Trees of each Sex, 
have been precarious, or at leaft not to have been 
expefted in equal Quantities. 

It feems pretty extraordinary, that this Difco- 
very fhould not have led the Ancients to dete<ft 
the whole Procefs of Nature in the Propagation 
of the various Species of Vegetables j and yet it 
does not appear, by any of their Writings, that 
are come down to us, that they went farther 
than this obvious Remark upon the Palm-Tree, 
and fome fimilar Notions concerning the Fig. 
They had indeed, from what they faw in thefe 
Plants, formed a Notion that all others were 
Male and Female likewife * ; but this Notion 

â€¢ Thus Theophraflui : 

" In Trees, confidered univerfal!y, and taking In each 
Â«' feveral Kind, there are, as has been faid, many Dif- 
" ferences. On6 of thefe is common to them all, 
" namely, that by which they are diftmguiflicd into 
Â«* Female and Male, of which the one bears Fruit, 
Â«' the other not, in fome Kinds ; in thofc in which 
" both bear Fruit, that of the Female is the beft, un- 
â€¢â€¢ lefs thefe are to be called Males, for fo they are 
Â«< called by fome."

â– was falfe, the far greater Part having Herma- 
phrodite Flowers, and fervcs to convince us, 
that what they difcovcrcd of the Pahn and Fig, 
was only a right Gucfs, and not founded on 
any Knowledge of the Anatomy of Flowers, 
either in thofe Trees, or any others. 

Tn this dark State the Dodtrine of the Sexes 
of Vegetables remained, not only through all 
the Ages of Antiquity, but almoft to the End 
of the laft Centurj', the Moderns feeing no more 
of this Doiflrine than the Ancients had done 
before them; and hence we have to this very 
Hour in Ufe, the falfe Diftindtions of Male and 
Female Species of Cornus, Paony, Cijliis, and 
many others, which have all Hermaphrodite 
Flowers, the Diftindtion in thefe Cafes being 
grounded on nothing more than fome Difference 
in the Habit of the two Species with which the 
Sexes arc no ways concerned. 

The Honour of having firft fi--ggefl;ed the 
true fexual Diftinftions in Plants appears to be 
due to our own Countryman, Sir Thomas Mil- 
lingtoH', from whofe Hints Dr. Grrju, as the 
Dodor himfelf acknowledges, was led to the 
Obfervations he has given on this Subject, in his 

a Ana-

Jnatonty of Plants *. After this, Camerarius, More- 
land, Genfioy, Faillant, Blair, Ji'JJieu, and Bradley, 
purfued their Enquiries and Experiments fo far 
as to remove all Doubt concerning thefe Difco- 
veries; and, lallly, Dodtor Limi^us founded 
thereon the Syftem of Botanv, which we arc 
going to explain in this Work. 

The Sexual Hypothefis, on its firft Appear- 
ance, was received with all that Caution that be- 
comes an enlightened Age; and Nature was 
traced experimentally through all her Variations, 
before it was univerfally aflfented to. Tournefort 
refufed to give it any Place in his Syftem j and 
Pontedera, though he had examined it, treated it 
as chimerical ; but the Proofs \thich Dr. Linnaeus

trated in his Phihfophia Botanka j-, are fo clear, 
that the Birth of Animals is not more evidently 
the Confcqiience of an Intercourfe between the 
Sexes, than that of Vegetables; and it would 
be now as ridiculous for any one, who has 
looked at the Arguments, to doubt of the one 
as of the other. 

We Ihall not attempt to lay all thcfe Proofs 
before the Reader; our Bufmefs is to explain, 
not denionftrate; but as it may be fatisfadtory to

ment made on the Palm-Tree.

is a great Tree of this Kind in the Garden of 
ihe Royal Academy. It has flowered and 
bore Frviit thefe thirty Years, but the Fruit 
never ripened, and when planted, it did not 
vegetate. The Palm-Tree, as you know, is 
a Fhinla Dioccia, that is, one of thofe in which 
the male and female Parts of Generation are 
upon different Plants. We having therefore 
no male Pkmts, the Flowers of our female 
were never impregnated with the Farina of 
the Male. There is a male Plant of this 
Kind i|i a Garden at L.dpftc, twenty German 
Miles from Berlhi. We procured from 
thence, in Jpril, 1749, a Branch of male 
Flowers, an J kifpcnded it over our female 
ones, and our Experiment fuccceded fo well, 
that our Palm-Tree produced more than an 
Hundred perfectly ripe Fruit; from which 
wc have already eleven young Palm-Trees. 
This. Experiment was repeated laft Year, 
and our Palm-Tree bore above two Thoufand 
ripe Fruit. As I do not remember a like 
Experiment, 1 thought it convenient to 
mention it to you j and, if you think proper, 
l)c pleafcd to commiuiicate it to the Royal 
i^oJcty."

This Letter, which was read to the Society 
the 2d of May, 1751, with feme ingenious Ob- 
fervations on the fame Subjcdt, by Dr. If'a/fon, 
F. R. S. to whom it was addreflcd *, has cfta- 
blifhed the Fact, atteftcd by the Ancients, con- 
cerning the Pahn-Tree, which fome may per- 
haps have looked upon as fabulous ; and, as the 
Frudtification in other Vegetables, though it may 
differ in particular Ciicumftances, h.is yet in 
general a manifeft Conformity with that of the 
Palm-Tree, in refpeCl to the Parts fuppofcd to 
be theOrgans of Generation, which are dilcover- 
able either on the fame, or on a feparate Flower, 
in all but the Clafs Qyptogamia, where they are 
too minute for Obfervation ; fo from this fingle 
Experiment we may fairly draw an Argument 
by Analogy, for the Confirmation of the whole 
fexual Hypothefis : But there are, as has been 
faid, other, and better Proofs. We have already 
diredied the R-eader to thofe flated by Linnans; 
whoever defires farther Satisfadtion concerning 
this Point, may fee the fevcral Demonftrations

PREFACE, 



publiflieJ in the Amanltatei Academics at Leyden, 
in 1749. 

Having thus explained, as far as feems necef- 
fary, the new Principles upon which the Refor- 
mation of the former vicious Syllems of Botany 
has been undertaken by the later Botanifts, we 
come to fliew, as we propofedj the Method that 
has been followed in this Introduction to the 
Science. 

The Work is divided into three Parts, and 
each Part into fundry Chapters. The Subjecfl 
of each Chapter may be fcen in the Table of 
Contents prefixed to the Work ; but with Re- 
fpeft to the three Parts, as no Title or Head 
explsnatory of the Matter each contains, could 
be conveniently prefixed to them, it will be 
proper to explain here the Scope of this Divi- 
fion. 

Vegetables, according to Linn^us, are prima- 
rily divifible into three Parts. 1. The Root. 
2. The Hab or Plant itfelf. 3. The FruBifica- 
tion. And in this Ordi-r thefe Parts might have 
been treated, were rt not on Account of the 
Sexual Syftcm; but as the Explanation of the 
latter was the principal Objedt of this Work, 

it 



PREFACE. XV 

it became necelTary to give up the Order of 
â€¢ the Parts of the Vegetable, and follow that of 
the Syftem. 

The Syftem is divided, i. into Cliffes. 2. Or- 
ders. 3. Genera. 4. Species. 5. J'lir'tcties. Now 
as the Claffcs, Orders, and Genera, which come 
firftin the Syftem, are eftabliflred on the FruÂ£ii- 
ficatioH alone, it became neceftary to give this 
Part of the Vegetable the Preference in Point 
of Order; and we have accordii>gly made the 
Fructification the Subjcdt of the fevcral Chapteis 
of the firft Part of this Work. 

In the fecond Part, we have given a full Ex- 
piation of the Cltiffes, Orders and Genera of the 
Syftem; which indeed contain the whole T/:eo- 
retic Part of it, the Doftrines of Species and Va- 
rieties having, as Linnaus obferves, a nearer Re- 
lation to xhz^raSiice. The Reafon for proceed- 
ing to the Syftem immediately after the Fruftl- 
fication is manifeft; as the Theory of the Syftem 
is eftablillied on the Fructification alone, an Ac- 
count of the latter was all that was neceftary to 
prepare the Reader for underftanding the Ex- 
planation of the former, which, as has been faid, 
was the principal Objedt of the Work,

In rhc third and lad Part, the two remain^ 
ing Parts of the Vegetable, viz. the Root and 
Herb, are treated of: And as thefe chiefly 
furnifh the Dodrines that refpeft the two laft 
Divifions of the Syllem, viz. Species and Fa- 
rieties. To thcfe Doftrines are alio included 
in this third Part, and make the Conclufion of 
the Work. 

The Two Tables fubjoined to the Work, 
have their Explanation prefixed ; and we Ihall 
only fpeak here of their Utility. It is pre- 
fumed that no exadt Table of the Limiaan 
Genera with their En^ljh Names, and a Re- 
fcrence to their Clalics and Orders, as given in 
the firft Table, has yet appeared in Print, our 
Writers not having adopted all the Liun^an 
Names, nor followed that Author exadly in 
his Diibibution of Vegetables ; our firft Table, 
therefore, cannot but be pf great Ufe to thofe 
who arc defirous of becoming acquainted with 
the Method of Ltrinteus, and of framing the 
Lifts of their private Colleftions upon the Plan 
of his Syftem. 

The Utility of the fecond Table, which con- 
tains the Names of the Genera rejefted by Lin- 
naeus. 



PREFACE, xvii 

)taus, is obvious; it might have been augment- 
ed to ten Times its Bullc, had all the Names 
been inferted that have been given to Vegetables 
by the numerous Writers on this Science; but 
fuch a Colledtion would be a Work of itfelf; 
and it has been, therefore, thought advifeable, 
to confine it to thofe only that are cited in the 
Genera Pbntarum of Linnaus, which contains the 
principal. 

The Table of Etigl'iJJ: Specific and Generic 
Names referred to in xht'ir Li nnaan Titles, which 
is given in the Appendix, was not originally 
intended to have been added to the Work ; 
but its Utility to the Englijh Botanift having 
been warmly infiftcd on by fomc of the Au- 
thor's Friends, it was prepared whilft the reft 
"of the Work was under the Prefs, and fub- 
joined to it as an Appendix. It has been ex- 
ecuted with Care : If, neverthelefs, any Mis- 
takes or material Omiffions fhould appear, 
thofe who are verfed in Botany will be the 
mod ready to excufe them, as they muft know 
the Difficulty of fuch an Undertaking, on Ac- 
count of the great Number of Removes, made 
by Dr. Linnaeus, of particular Species, as well 
as of Genera, from their old Stations; this 

DifE-

Difficulty was the greater, becaufe the Method 
of Linnai's has hitherto been but partially a- 
dopted by our Writers, and therefore no Tabic 
given in any Work already publifhed, could be 
depended on. 

The Defigns for the Figures of the Plates 
â€¢are for the mod Part taken from thofe given 
by Liniitfus in his Works. Some of them, 
might, perhaps, have been mended by frelh 
Defigns from Nature ; but as the Work here 
given to the Public is profeffedly an Ex- 
traft of the Limiitan Dodtrines, it was thought 
that the Figures he had himfelf feleded, would, 
upon the whole, come the neareft to his own 
Meaning, and be of the greateft Help in ex- 
plaining it. 

The Reader will find placed before the 
Gloflary, a Colledtion of all the Terms of 
Art, explained and numbered ; the Ufe of 
thefe Terms, fo colleftcd will appear evident, 
from the Manner of their Arrangement, be- 
ginning with the Root, and continued through 
the Trunk, Branches, Leaves, and Fructifi- 
cation.

This will be neceflary on all Occafions to the 
Learner in Botany, either in defcribing Plants, 
or in finding out the true Meaning of the De- 
fcriptions of Authors, every Term refpcfting 
the different Parts of the Plant, may be ken at 
one View, belonging to the Article wanted, 
whether it is the Root, Stem, Leaf, or Flower. 

The Ufe of the Gloffary is to alTifl: young 
Beginners who are unacquainted with fcientific 
Method ; and can with greater Eafe twrn to an 
Alphabet for the Explanation of a Term, than 
to clafTical Arrangement.

though the Fruit does not fwell and ripea

All thele Parts, and their feveral Ufes,

here, that the four hrft; viz. Calyx*, Co-

THE CALYX is the Termination of 
the Cortex, or outer Bark, of the Plant; 
which, after accompanying the Trunk or 
Stem through all its Branches, breaks out 
with the Flower, and is prefent in the Fruc- 
tification in this new Form. Its chief Ufc 
is to enclofe and protcifl the other Parts. It 
has received different Appellations, accord- 
ing to the Circumftances with which it is 
attended, viz. 

PERIANTHIUM, a Flower-cup, when 
its Station is clofe to the Frudification. If 
it includes the Stamina, and not the Germen, 
it is the Perianthium of the Flower ; if the 
Germen, but not the Stamina, the Perian- 
thium of the Fruit ; but if it includes both, 
it is the Perianthium of the Frudification.

certain Rule, that a Calyx always withers 
when the Fruit is ripe, if not before ; but 
the Braflea will remain longer. Without 
attending to this, Miftaices might eafily be 
made in Helleborus, Nigella, Fajjipra, He-

The Leaves of which the Corolla confifts 
are called Petals ; byvrhich Appellation they 
are conveniently diftinguithed from the green 
Leaves of the Plant with which they might 
elfe be confounded*. The Petal is defined 
by Linnaus as a coroUaceous Covering to the

POLTPETALOUS, of many Petals; each 
Petal confifts of Unguis, a Claw, which is 
the Lower Part faflened to the Bafe ; and 
Lamina, a thin Plate, which is the upper 
Part, and ufually fpreading. A polypetalous 
Corolla is. cnicif-^rm^ croJs-JJ^ap^d, when it 
confifts of four Petals that are equal and 
Ipreading ; and Papilionaceous, Butterjiy-Jhap- 
ed: when it is irregular, confifting of four 
Petals, of which the under one refembles the 
Keel of a Ship, the upper one rifes, and the 
two fide ones ftand fingle. 

There belongs alfo to the Corolla a Part 
called the NeSlarium, which has been but 
newly diftinguifhed, having been by former 
Botanifts confounded with the Petals. It is 
by Linnaus defined to be the Part which 
bears the Honey, and belonging to the Flower 
only. This Part affords a wonderful Variety 
in the manner of its appearance. In fome 
Plants it is very large, as in the Narcijfiis 
and Aquikgla ; in the former of which the 
Cup, and in the latter the Horns, are Nee- 
taria : In others it is fcarce difcoverable, 
even with GlaiTes. In fome Plants it is united 
with, and makes Part of, the Petals : In 
others it is detached from them. Its Shape 
and Situation are alfo as various. Its Ufe is 

not

not known, unlefs the Suppofition of its fe- 
creting the Honey may be depended upon. 
Between the Calyx and Corolla Nature 
has put no abfolute limits ; as is plain from 
the Dap/inis, in which Plant they grow to- 
gether, and are united in the Margin, like 
a Leaf of the Buxus; but they may be com- 
monly diftinguifhed by their Pofition in re- 
fpect of the Stamina, the Petals and btamina 
being ranged alternately ; whereas the Seg- 
ments of the Calyx and the Stamina anfwer 
to each other. That this is their natu- 
ral Situation, appears from the complete 
Flowers in the Claffes Tetrandria * and 
Fentandria f ; And the Ufe of applying 
this Rule will be found in the Inftances of 
Chenopodium, Urtica, and Parietaria ; where 
it decides, that the fingle Cover in thofe Ge- 
neral a Perianthium, and that it is the Co- 
rolla that is wanting.' Should we infer, 
where only one of the two Covers appears, 
that it is a Corolla, becaufe that is a more 
principal Part, there would be no Certainty 
from fuch an Inference ; as is evident from 
the Ammania^ Ifnarda, Peplis, Ruellia and 
Campanula^ in all which the Corolla is often 
found wanting, but not the Calyx.

JO AN INTRODUCTION 

That the Calyx, as proceeding from the 
Cortex of the Plant, is coarfer and thicker 
than the Corolla, which is produced by the 
foft, pliant, colored Liber, is obvious to every 
one. But there are no Limits determinable 
from anv fuch Circumflanccs, unlefs it be 
from the Color ; and even this is not fuf- 
ficient; for the Perianthium of the Bart/ia 
is Blood-colored ; and there are alfo many 
P'lovvers whofe Corolla are colored, naked, 
and fubjeÂ£t to lofe their Petals when in the 
State of Flowering, but which afterwards 
harden and turn Green, and remain on the 
Plant like a Calyx ; as for Inftance, the 
Hclleborus and Oniithogalum, 

The Euphorbia has deceived many, who 
have defcribed it as monopetalous, taking 
the Calyx for the Corolla. But that the 
Feltce*, as they are called, upon the Leaves 
of the Lichen^ are really the Petals of the 
Flower, is proved by fome annual Species in 
India^ in which there are white Petals very 
dlftinguifhable. 

* The Pelta are the Fruftification of the Lichen. 
They are flat, and are for the mod Part faftened to the 
Edges of the Leaves.

THE STAMINA are the Male Part

as an Entrail of the Plant, defigned for the 
Preparation of the Pollen ; of which we fhall

Each fingle Stamen confifts of two Parts, 
viz. 

1. FIL AMENTUM, the Filament or 
Thread; which fervesto elevate the At^thera, 
or Summit, and at the fame Time connects 
it with the Flower. 

2. ANTHER A, the Summit Itfelf ; which 
contains within it the Pollen, and when 
come to Maturity difcharges the fame. 

The POLLEN, Meal, contained within 
the Antherae, is a fine Duft fecreted therein,

THE PISTILLUM is the Female 
Part of the Flovirer : It is defined by 
Linnaus as an Entrail of the Plant, defigned 
for the reception of the Pollen. It confifts 
of three Parts. 

1. ThtGERMEN', which is the Rudi- 
ment of the Fruit accompanying the Flower, 
but not yet arrived at Maturity. 

2. The STYLE ; which is the Part that 
ferves to elevate the Stigma from the Ger- 
men. 

3. The STIGMA; which is the Summit 
of the Piflillum, and covered with a Moif- 
turefor the Breaking of the Pollen. 

It has been faid in the laft Chapter, that 
the Pollen was deftined to the Impregnation 
of the Germen : Tnis is performed in the

following Manner. The Anthera, which at 
the firft opening of the Flower are whole, 
burft open foon after, and difcharge the Pol- 
len ; which difpcrfing itfelf about the Flower, 
Part of it lodges on the Surface of the Stig- 
ma, where it is detained by the Moifture 
with which that Part is covered ; and each 
fingle Grain or Atom of the Pollen burfling 
and diflblving in this Liquor, as it has beea 
obferved to do by the Microfcope, is fup- 
pofed to difcharge fomething that impreg- 
nates theGermen below: What the Sub- 
ftance is that is fo difcharged, and whether 
it adually paffes through the Style into the 
Germen, feems yet undetermined, it being 
difficult to obferve fuch minute Parts : but 
whatever be the Operation by which Nature 
produces the Effed in Queftion, the Caufe, 
as far as it has been here explained, is fcarce 
difputable; and accordingly we fee, that after 
this Impregnation, when the Parts of the 
Flower that have done their Office are fallen 
away, the Germen fwells to a Fruit big with 
Seeds, by which the Species is propagated. 
The Piftillum being, as I have faid, the Fe- 
male Part of the Flower, is of great Con- 
iequence in the fexual Syftem, as well as the 
Male Part; as will appear when the Syftem

UMRELLA, an Umbel, is a Receptacle, 
which, from a common Center, runs out into 
Thread-fhaped Foot-ftalks of proportionate

it has no Subdivifions ; a compound Umbel, 
when each Foot-flalk is terminated by an 
TJmbelluia or little Umbel \ and in this Cafe, 
the Umbel that bears the Umbellula on its

A SEED, is a deciduous Part of a Plant, 
fraught with the Rudiment of a new Plant, 
and quickened by the Pollen. 

ANTHERA, is a ^'^e{^el that produces 
and difcharges the Pollen. 

PERICARPIUM, is a Veflel that pro- 
duces and difcharges the Seeds. 

FILJMENTUM, is the Foot that fup- 
ports the Anthera, and fallens it to the Ve- 
getable. 

GERMEN, is the Rudiment of the Pc- 
ricarpium or of the Semen, not yet arrived 
at Maturity ; its Exiftence is chiefly at the 
Time when the Anthera is difcharging its 
Pellen. 

STIGMA, Is the moIRened Summit of 
the Germen. 

STTLUS, is the Foot of the Stigma, that 
conneÂ£ls it with the Germen. 

COROLLA and CJLT'X, are the Tegu- 
ments or Covers of the Stamina and Pillil- 
lum ; the Calyx arifing from the cortical 
EpUermis, ox outer Bar k^ and the Corolla 
from the Liber, or inner Bark. 

RECEPTACULUM, is that Part which 
connects the Parts before mentioned.

The MOST NATURAL STRUCTURE 
of the Parts, in refpeO: to NUMBER, is. 
To have the Calyx divided into as many 
Segments as the Corolla ; The Filaments 
equal in Number to the Segments of the. 
Corolla and Calyx ; A fingleAnthera on each 
Filament ; The Divifions of the Piftillum 
equal in Number to the Cells of the Peri- 
carpium, or the Receptacles of the Seeds; 
the moft common Number, five; (^whence 
the Extent of the Clafles Pentandria * and 
Syngenejia f,) and the Corolla and Calyx 
alfo qiiitiquijidt cut into Jive Segments. 

In refpea to FIGURE^ To have the 
Calyx lefs fpreading than the Corolla ; The 
Corolla widening gradually ; The Stamina 
and Piftillum upright and tapering; The 
Pericarpium big with Seeds, fvvelling and 
extending after the reft of the Parts (the 
Calyx excepted) are fallen off. 

In refpea to PROPORTION, To have 
the Calyx lefs than the Corolla ; The Piftil- 
lum of equal Length with the otamina in 
an upright Flower, but longer in an inverted 
one ; if the Flower flope downward, the 
Stamina and Piftillum inclining towards the 
under Side ; but if it flope upwards, placed 
clofe under the upper Side.

In rcfpea to SITUATION, To have the 
Perianthium furroundlng the Receptacle ; 
The Corolla placed on the Receptacle, and 
alternate \vith the Penanthiuin ; The Fila- 
ments placed within the Corolla, but correfr 
ponding vrith the Perianthium; The An- 
thcrce feated on the Tops of the Filaments ; 
TheGermen poflefljng the Centre of the Re- 
ceptacle ; The Style landing on the Top of 
the Gernien ; The Stigma feated on the Top 
of the Style. When the Stigma and Style 
are fallen, the Germen grows to a Pericar- 
pium,fupported by the Calyx, and including 
the Seeds which are affixed to the Recep- 
tacle of the Fruit. The Receptacle of the 
Flower is generally under the Pericarpium, 
being not fo often found to grow either 
round it or over it.

Deciduous, dropping off with the Flower, which 
is the moft common j or Marcefcent, wither^ 
ing, but not falling, as in Campanula, Orchis^

Variations of the N e c t a r i u m. 

It has been already faid, Chap. 3. that 
the Nedtarium, by the former Botanifts, had 
been confounded with the Petals ; but though 
it commonly attends upon, and makes Part 
of the Corolla, it is often found didlin(5l 
from it, as in the Inftances of Accnitum, 
Aquilegia, Helleborus, IJopyrum, Nigella, Ga- 
ridella, Epimedium, ParnaJJia, Theobroma^ 
Cherkria and Saircagejia ; which fufficiently 
proves, that it fhould be diftinguifhed from 
the Petals. The Nedlarium affords very 
fmgular Varieties, efpecially if it grows dif- 
tinÂ£t from the Petals. It admits of the fol- 
lowing principal DiftinQions.

of the Parts o/'Fructification. 

BY a fingular Struflure of the Parts of 
Frudification, is tobe undcrftood fucli 
a one as is obferved but in very few Ge- 
nera ; it is diredlly oppofed to the natural 
Strudure explained in Chap. lo. For In- 
ftances of this we may mention the Arum, 
whofe Stamina are within the Piflilla; the 
Adoxa^ whofe Germen fcparates the Corolla 
from the Caly.K ; the i'^Aj/^, whofe Filaments 
are articulate, jointed ; the Eriocaulori^ whofe 
Stamina are placed on the Germen, and 
whofe Corolla and Calyx are below the Ger- 
men ; and the Magnolia^ the Receptacle of 
whofe Fruit is capitate, headed, the Seeds, 
which are like Berries, hanging by a Thread 
out of the Capfule j but to take the Parts in 

their Order. 

The CALYX is ufually lefs colored than 
the COROLLA; but in the American 
Bartfia the Perianthium is bloody ; in the 
herbaceous Cornus the Petals are black, but 
the Involucrum white; and in the American 
2 Cornui

Cormn the Involucrum is red, and Cordate^ 
Heart -Jhaped. In Jlftrantia the Involucrum 
is colored ; and in Palms the Spaths are 
bloody } where the Corolla is wanting, the 
Perianthium is wont to be more colored 
efpecially when the Flowers are blowing, as 
in Ornithogalum^ Perjicaria^ and Polygonum j 
where either the Calyx or the Corolla is 
found to be lefs colored, the Leaves ofteii 
take a Color, as in Amaranthus tricolor. 

In moft Plants the ST J MIN J and PE- 
TALS are inferted into the Receptacle, in 
the Bottom of the Flower ; but the Plants 
of the Clafs Icofandria * have a monophyl- 
lous Calyx, the inner Side of which is girt 
with a Line, to which the Stamina and Pe- 
tals are faftened ; and the Calyx is alfo ob- 
ferved to fupport the Flowers in fome other 
Plants, as in Lyihrum, Epilobium, Oenothera, 
Ammania^ Ifnarda, PepHs, and Elaagnus. In 
fome Plants the Receptacle is lined on all 
Sides with the Perianthium, and the Co- 
rolla adheres to the Perianthium as though 
it were glued to it ; this is found in the Cu 
curbitaceous f Plants, fuch as Cucurbita, Paf- 
fifloroy Fe-oillcea, Momordica, I'richojanthes,

the Stamina are ufually feparate from the 
Petals : But this alfo has a few Exceptions j 
for in the Statice, which is pcntapetalous, 
the Filaments are inferted in the Claws of 
the Petals ; in Melanthum, which is hexa- 
petalous, they are inferted in the Petals ; 
and in the Lychnis^ which is pcntapetalous, 
as alfo in Saponaria, Cucubjlus, Silene, and

The ANTHERM are commonly placed 
on the Tops of the Filaments : But they 
flick clofe to the Sides of the Filaments in 
Paris and j^ijarum, and adhere to the Stigma 
without rilaments in ylrijlolochia. 

The Singularities of the NECTJRIUM 
have been already mentioned in Chap 12. 

The PISTILLUM is commonly placed 
witnin the Anther,!: : But in the Anim there 
is this Singularity, that the Receptacle runs 
out into a Club, the Bafe of which is occu- 
pjed by the Piftilla, and the upper Part by 
the Stamina ; io that here the Piftilla ftand 
on the Outfide of and furround the Stamina; 
and in the Cal'a oi Ethiopia thcfe Parts are 
difpofed in the fame Manner. The Rumex 
is fmgular in the Infertion of its Stamina. 

The STTLE is commonly placed on the 
Top of the Germen : Some Exceptions to 
this have been given in Chap. 14. to thefe 
may be added Fajfcrina, Gnidia^ Struthia^ 
and Stellaria.

although there is the Appearance of fueh a 
Singularity in M.^gnolia, Uvan'a, and il//-

fuch Cafes to be looked upon only as a com- 
mon Receptacle. 

Where the Pericarpium is a Berry, it is 
diftinguifhable into />roper Berries, thofc

from aggregate in this, that they have not 
any Partof Frudlfication common to many 
Flowers, as is the Cafe with aggregate. 
Flowers are called aggregate, when many 
FiofcuH, Florets, are, by the Mediation of 
fome Part of the Frudification common to 
them all, fo united, that no one of them 
could be taken out without deftroying the 
Form of the whole, of which it was a Fart.

Compound Flowers are of three Kinds : 
J . Ligulate, when all the Corollula^ little Co- 
rolltTy of the Florets are plane, fiat^ fhaped 
like Ligula, a narroiD Tongue, or Fillet, and 
expanded towards the outer Side. 2. Ttibii-'-

placed on a Receptacle, onfaftigiate Pedun- 
cles* that are all produced from the fame 
Point : A fimple Umbel is when the Recep- 
tacle is but once divided into Peduncles ; a 
compound Un)bel is when all the common 
Peduncles are fubdivided into Umbellula, 
little Umbels ; an Umbellula therefore is a 
partial Umbel . 

Umbellate Flowers, properly fo called f , 
have the following Properties, i. A com- 
mon Receptacle divided into Peduncles in 
the manner above mentioned, whether the 
Umbel produced be plane, fat ; cowvexy 
rounding ; or concave^ hollow. 2. A Ger- 
men under the Corollula 3. Five diftind 
Stamina that are deciduous. 4. A bifid 
Piflillum. 5. Two Seeds joined at their 
Summits. 

A Radiate Umbel is when the marginal 
Petals are larger than thofe of the Difk, as 
in Tordylium, Caucalis, Coriandrumt Ammi^ 
and forae Species of Heracleum ; an Umbel 
may varyalfo in having the Flowers of the

one, of many Florets, placed on a Recepta- 
cle upon faftigiate * Peduncles, the primary 
ones of which iflue from the fame Centre

O/'LuxuRiANT Floivers, commonly called 
Double. 

A Flower is faid to be luxuriant, when 
fome of the Parts of Frudification are 
augmented in Number, and others thereby 
excluded. The Luxuriancy is commonly 
ouing to the Luxuriancy of its Nourilh- 
ment ; the Part multiplied is ufually the Co- 
roUn, but fometimes the Calyx alfo ; and 
by this Increafe of the Covers, the eflential 
Parts of Frutfiification are deftroyed. Luxu- 
riant Flowers are divifible into, \ .MiiltipU- 
cate^ muUiplied. 2. Pleni^ full. And, 3. 
Frolifermis^ producing Young ; to which may

treble^ or quadruple beries or Row, accord- 
ivng to the Number of the Repetitions of the 
Corolla. The Pohpetalous Flowers are the 
moft fubjed: to Multiplication ; the Mono- 
pet alous are multiplied like wife, but it is 
very uncommon to meet with them full. 
A colored Perianthium, though it may have 
the Appearance of a Repetition of the Co- 
lolla, ought not to be confidered as fuch ; 
for though this Appearance is in fome De- 
gree tiionjlrousy unnatural^ it is no Multipli- 
.cation.

cautious alfo of conftituting a Genus from 
them ; for the Characters of aGenusfhould 
be drawn from the Parts when in their na- 
tural State, and not when in a State of 
Luxuriancy. 

Plenitude is chiefly incidental topolype- 
talous Flowers, as in Malus, Pyrus^ Per/ica, 
Cerafus, j1.mygdalus, Myrtust Rofa^ Fragaria, 
Panunculus,Cahba, Hepatica, Anemojie, Aqui-

ria, "Tulipa, Narciffusy Cc/cbicurn, Crocus^ 
Cheiranthusy Hefperisy Maka, Alcea^ and 
Hibifcus. 

Plenitude of monopetalous Flowers is by 
forae Authors held a Contradiction ; but 
this cannot be granted ; for there are In- 
ilances of it in Colchicumy Crocus, Hyacin^ 
tbusy and Po'ianthes: However, it is rare that 
their Luxuriancy pafies Duplicity. When 
they are filled, it is by the Multiplication of 
the Lacini^s, Segments ; whereas the Poly- 
petalous are ufually filled by the Multipli- 
cation of the Petals ; but the Manner in 
which the Impletiov^fill'mg, is brought about, 
muftbe more paracularly confidered. 

The Impletion is either in fimple or com- 
pound Flowers j we fhall begin with the 
Simple. 

The

The Implction of SIMPLE Flowers, is 
by the Increafe either of the Petals, or of 
the Neaarium. The Impletion of the Jqui" 
legia is obfervcd to be after three different 
manners, wz. cither, i. By multiplying its 
Petals, and excluding the Nedaria : 2. By 
multiplying its Nedaria, and excluding it* 
Petals : Or, ^. By multiplying its Nedaria, 
and retaining its Petals ; in which laft Cafe 
the five Petals rerfiain, and the Spaces be- 
tween them are each of them filled up with 
a triple Cafe of Nedaria, that is, three Nec- 
taria buried one within another. 

The Impletion of the Nigella is by mul- 
tiplying the Nedariaonly ; that of theA^^r- 
cijfiis two Ways, by multiplying either the 
Nedarium only, or both Nedarium and 
Petals ; that of Delphinium^ for the moft 
Part, by multiplying the Petals, and exclud- 
ing the Nedarium : The Change wrought 
in the Saponaria AngUcana is remarkable, 
the Flower from Pentapetalous becoming 
truly Monopetalous ; and the Alteration ia 
the Pehria is alfo very fingular*. But the

moft extraordinary Inftance of Plenitude is 
that of the Opulus fore globcfo, commovAy 
called the Gelder Rofe. In the common 
fimple Opulus^ the Flowers are produced on 
a Cyma, which confifts of a great Number 
of Campanulate, Bell-Pjaped, Hermaphro- 
dite Flowers in the DilTc, and of others in 
the Circumference, whofe Corollae are larg- 
er, flat, and Wheel-fhaped, and that are 
barren, wanting the Pijiillum. But in the 
Opulus fore gkbofo, all the Flowers of the 
Difk are barren alfo, and fhaped like thofe 
of the Circumference; fo that the Impletion 
here arifes only from the additional Number 
of barren Flowers, the Corollse of which 
are of a larger Size ; and in this it refem- 
bles the Impletion of the compound Flow- 
ers, of which we fliall prefently fpeak. 

Pericarpium and Seeds, and alfo in Color: which has 
given Rife to a Suppofitioii, that the Peloria is only a 
L'naria in a monftrous State ; fee the Differtation of 
Daniel Rudbcrg on the Peloria in the Ar.ocnhatei Acade- 
mics, Vol. I. p. 280. But as the Dmria and Peloria 
differ fo widely in their Corolix and Stamina, that the 
former mnft be referred to the Clafs D:J)nc:mia, and the 
latter to the Clafs Pe>itandria,x\\s Peloria cannot be fup- 
pofed to derive its Origin from the Llnaria, without 
overturning the fundamental Principles of tl>e Science: 
Andtherefore till more Inilances can be pioducedofthi* 
kind of Irregularity in N.iture, the Pt/ar/a cannot with 
Safety be confidered otlierwife than as a Genus diilindJ 
from that of Antirrhinum. 

Before 



T O B O T A N Y. 63 

Before we leave the fimple Flowers, it 
will be of Ufe to remark, that a fimple 
Flower, in a State of Luxuriancy, may in 
all Cafes bediftinguifhed from a compound 
One in its natural State, by this Rule ; That 
in fimple Flowers, how much foever multi- 
plied, there is but one Piftillum in the Cen- 
tre of the Flower, common to the whole 
Multiplication ; whereas in compound Y\oyf' 
ers, each of the Florets is furniflied with 
its own Piftillum and Stamina. 

We come now to the Impletion oi COM- 
POUND Flowers ; that thefe are of three 
kinds, Ligulatc, Tiibuhfe, and Radiate, has 
been fliown and explained in Chap. 19. 
where it has alio been feen, that there is not 
either in the Ligulate or Tubulofe any Dif- 
tlnflion of Difk or Radius, all the ilorets 
in thefe being alike ; but that the contrary 
is the very Charaderiftic of the Radiate ; 
now this being attended to, ,the manner of 
the Impletion will be eafily undcrftood. 
Compound Flowers gain their Impletion 
two Ways, either by the Radius, or the 
Dilk. We fliall begin with the firft. 

Impletion by the Radius is when, by the 
Multiplication of the Radius, the Dillc of 
the Flower is filled up : as in Hclianthw, 
Cahidula, Chryfanthemum, Anlhemis, Matri- 
caria^ 



64 AN INTRODUCTION 

caria, Ftarmica^ Tagetes, and the Specie8 
ofCentaurea cA\e<\Cyanus. In this Sort of 
Impletion, which belongs only to radiate 
Flowers, it is obfervable, that all the Flo- 
rets which fill up the Difk follow the Con- 
ditions of thofe of the Radius ; fo that if the 
Florets of the Radius in the natural Flower 
ha\'e a PiAillum, all thofe of the full Flower 
will have one alfo, as In Matricaria^ Bellisy 
Chryfanthcmum^ and Tagetes ; or if they have 
no Piftillum, then it will alfo be wanting 
in the full one, as in Helianthus^ Calendula^ 
and Centaiirca ; and the fame holds true of 
the male Part alfo ; for as the Florets of the 
Radius in the natural Flower are never fur- 
nifhed with Anthers, fo thefe are wanting 
alfo in all thofe of the full ones. This laft 
Remark is of great Ufe to diftinguilh a Ra- 
diate full FLoucr, from a Ligulate natural 
one ; which might be confounded in many 
Cafes, were we not apprized, that there are 
Anthersc in the latter, but none in the for- 
mer ; by this Rule, in Chrxfanthimum^ He- 
lianthus. Calendula., and Jagetcs, when the 
Difk is deftroyed by the Multiplication of 
the Radius, we know by the Defeft of An- 
theras, that it is only the Luxuriancy of a 
radiate Flower, as in Hieracium, Lcontodon, 
and So/ic/n/s ; by the Prefence of the An- 
thers 



TO BOTANY. 65 

iherx we know the Flowers to be ligulate 
and natural. 

Iinpletion by the T)^Jk is, when there is 
no Multiplication of the Radius ; but the 
Corollulx of the Dilk run out into Length, 
and have their Brims lefs divided : 1 his 
manner of Impletion feems to concern only 
the Radiate and the Tubulofe *. In the Ra- 
diate, it will fo far affedt the Radius as to 
change its Mowers from Ligulate to Tubu- 
lofe : Inftances of this manner of Lnpletion 
may be had in Bellis, Matricaria, and Ta- 
getes. In the Carduus of the Oats, which 
is a Species oi Serratula, the Coroilulse are 
both lengthened and enlarged. In refped to 
the Ligulate Flowers, if weconfine ourfelves 
to the two-fold manner of Impletion, after 
the Author whofe Divifions we have adopt- 
ed, we fhall be obliged to call their Imple- 
tion alfo, an Impletion by the Difk ; though 
the Manner of it differs from that laft ex- 
plained, and the Expreflion does not fo well 
anfwer to Flowers, that in theBotanical .Senfe 
of the Term have properly no Difk at all. 
But not to (lop at too great Niceties, their 

* This is not exprefsly aflerted, as the Diftindtion is 
omitted, in the Phllofophia B-'tamca oi Linn^ut; but it 
appears to be his Meaning, by his fpeaking of the Im- 
pletion of ligulate Flowers feparately afterwards. 

F Implc' 



66 AN INTRODUCTION 

Impletion is by the lengthening of their 
Stigmata, and the enlarging and diverging 
of their Germina ; by which Augmenta- 
tions, the full Flowers are to be diftinguiflied 
from the natural ones, as in Scorzonera and 
Lapfana vulgaris ; which laft, Liwiceus tells 
us, is frequently found with a full Flower 
at Upfal 

3. Flowers are faid to be PRO LIFE- 
ROUS, when one Slower grows out of an- 
other : This generally happens in full Flow- 
ers, the Fulnefs being the Caufe of their 
becoming proliferous. Prolification is after 
two Manners ; i . From the Centre ; 2. 
From the Side. 
â€” Prolification from the Centre, which hap- 
pens in fimple Flowers, is when the Piftil- 
lumfhoots up into another Flower {landing 
on a fingle Peduncle ; of which there are 
Inftances in Diatithus^ Ranunculus^ Anemone, 
Geum, and Rojh. 

Prolification from the Side, which happens 
hi aggregate Flowers, properly fo called (fee 
Chap. 19.) is when many pedunculate 
Flowers ara produced out of one common 
Calyx ; of which there are In fiances in Bel- 
lis, Cakfidula, Hieracium, and Scabiofa. 

In umbellate Flowers, the Prolification fs 
by the Increafe of the Umbellulae, one fim- 
ple 



TOBOTANY. 67 

pie Umbellula producing another, as In Cor- 
nus and Periclymcnum ; and in this manner 
compound Umbels will htcomt Jupradecom- 
â– poiind, more than compounded a fccond Tiaie, 
as in Selinum and T.'hyJ}'clinum. 

A proliferous Flower is called Frondofe*"^ 
leafy, when it produces Leaves ; this rarely 
happens, but Inftances of it have been found 
in Rofa, Anemofte^ and others : The other 
Kinds of Prolification are frequent enough. 

4. MUTILATE Flowers are the Reverfe 
of Luxuriant. Linnctm confines the Term 
to thofe Flowers only that want the Corolla:, 
though they ought to be furnifhed with it ; 
which often happens in Tpomcea., Campmm-: 
la, RutTlia, Vio/d, TuJJilago and Cucubalus : 
The Caufc of this Defcdt he afcribes chiefly 
to the want of fufficient Heat. 

â€¢ From, witli the Ancients (tho' frequently ufed, in 
refpeft to Trees, in the fame Scnfe with Folium, a Leaf) 
implieil, in its proper Signification, a Part of the Wood 
of the Tree with ihe Leaf ; or as we fliouid exprefs it, 
a Twig with Leaves ; and for this Reafon they never ap- 
plied the Term to the Leaves of Herbs (which were al- 
ways called Filia) but only to ihofeof Trees, Linn.'Fus 
has availed himfelf of this old DiftintTion to make it 
a botanical Term; which he applies to exprefs theCir- 
cumftances of Palms and Filices, Feins; in the former of 
which the Branches, and in the latter even the Stem it- 
felf is an aftual Lenf : And here again he applies it to 
the leafy Prolification in Qjeftion, calling it Frondof;, 
rather than Foliaceous, for the like Reafon

The Liixuriancy of the Calyx^ n>entloned 
in the beginning of this Chapter, is very 
infrequent, but not without Inftances ; in 
Diantbus Caryopbyllus there is a Variety, in 
which the Squama', Scales, of the Calyx are 
fo muliiphed as to conftitute a pcrfedl Spike 
in a manner moft fimgular : The Gramina^ 
Grafjesy of the Alps, become full by their 
Glutihr^ Hujks., fhooting out into Leaves, as 
in a irpecies of the Fejltua ; and in Salix 
rcf'iT^ and Fhntago rofea^ the Squamas of 
the Amentum of the former, and the Brac- 
teas * of the Spike in the latter will ihoot 
into Leaves alfo. 

Linnceus has enumerated fome Tribes of 
Plants, which are not found fubjed to Luxu- 
riancy ; but as the Heads, under which he 
has ranged them, are taken from the Syf-

explain them ; and we Ihall therefore omit

Of the Sex of Plants. 

THE Diflintftion of Flowers Into Male, 
Female, Hermaphrodite, and Neuter, 
has been already explained in Chap. /;. To 
which we muft add, that Hermaphrodite 
Flowers are fometimes diflinguilhable into 
Male Hermaphrodites, and Fd'/W.-' Herma- 
phrodites : This is, when, although the 
Flower contains the Par:s belonging to each 
Sex, one of them proves aboriive or ineffec- 
tual ; if the Defefl: be in the Stamina^ it is 
a Female Hermaphrodite j if in the Pijhl- 
liim^ a Male one. The Cafe wherein this 
Diftindion becomes necelTary, happens very 
rarely : It will be ihewn in the Courfe of 
this Chapter. 

Plants, in refped to Sex, take their De- 
nominations from the Sex of their Flowers 
in the manner following. 

1. HERMAPHRODirE Plants are 
fuch as upon the fame Root bear Flowers, 
that are all Hermaphrodite, as in moft Ge-

5. POLYGAMOUS %, fuch as either on

phrodite Flowers, and Flowers of either or 
of both Sexes, as in the Clafs Folygamia Â§. 
Of Plants that are Polygamous on the

Hermaphrodite , and Female Hermaphrodite 
Flowers ; which is a very rare Cafe, but is 
obferved in Mufa. 2d. Hermaphrodite ||,and

brought to a greater Precifion, and rendered 
more conformable to true Philnfophy in

preceded it. The Author of it does not 
pretend to call it a natural one ; he gives it 
as artificial only, and modeftly owns his 
Inability to deted: the Order purfued by Na- 
ture in her vegetable Produdions : But of 
this he feems confident, that no natural 
Syftem can ever be framed, uithout taking

Explanation of the Titles of the Twenty- 
four Classes. 

HAVING in the preceding Chapter 
given theDivilions of the Syftem, we 
fliall in this explain the Meaning of the 
Terms ufed for the Titles of the Claflcs. 
As thefe Terms in the Grt-^-i Language, from 
whence they are taken, are all exprefhve of 
the principal Circumftance that obtains in 
the Clafs to which they are applied, the 
Explanation of them will itfelfgive us a good 
infight into the proper Charadtcrs of the fe- 
veral ClalTcs, and the fexual Diftindions on 
which they are founded : However, it will 
be neceflary to fay fomething more particu- 
lar concerning many of them afterwards in 
the Chapters we (hall allot for each of them 
feparately. 

Class 1. MON/INDRIA. 2. DI-

TRANDRIA. 5. PENTANDRIA. 
6. HEXANDRIA. 7. HEPTANDRIA.

DRIA. 10. DECANDRTA.â€”Thek 
ten Claffes, which confift of Herma- 
phrodite 



TO BOTANY. 97 

phrodite Flowers, take their Denomina- 
tions from the Number of Stamina, or male 
Parts of the Flower. The Word here com- 
pounded with the numerical Terms, figni- 
fies a Hufiand ; fo that the Title Monandria 
expreiTes, that the Flowers of this Clafs have 
but one Hufband, that is, one Stamen ; Z)/- 
andria, two Stamina ; Triandria, three ; 7^- 
trandria^foiir ; Pejitandria,Jive ; Hexandriut 
fix ; Hepto?idria, /even ; 0Â£Jandna, eight ; 
Rnneandrla, tiifie ; and Decandria, ten. It 
muft be obferved however, that the Flowers 
being Hermaphrodite, as above mentioned, 
is in all thefe Claffes a neceflary Condition; 
for fhould the female Part be wanting, the 
Plant would belong to fome other Clafs, not- 
withflanding the Number of Stamina may 
be fuch as would otherwife refer it to one 
of thefe : And this Caution we give once 
for all to avoid Repetitions, that when we 
ufe the Term Hermaphrodite ^ we mean that 
it is a Condition not to be difpenfed with. 

Class XI. D O D E C A N D RI A.â€” 
This Term in the Greek imports that the 
Flowers have twelve Hufbands or Stamina. 
However, the Clafs is not confined to this 
Number, but includes all fuch Hermaphro- 
dite Flowers as are furnifhed with any 
Number of Stamina from twehe to nineteetf 
5 jnclufive : 



8o AN INTRODUCTION 

inclufive : No Flowers have been yet found 
to have eleven Stamina, which is the Reafoii 
no Clais has been allotted to that Number. 

Class XII. ICOSANDRI/I.â€”This 
Term imports, that the Flowers hsLVctivenfy 
Hulharids or stamina : But here again the 
Title is to be underftood with great Lati- 
tude ; for though the Plants that belong to 
this Clafs are rarely found wish lefs than 
twenty Stamina, yet they frequently have a 
greater Number: and they are therefore not 
to be known with Certainty from thofe of 
the next Clafs, v.lthout having Recourfe to 
their cladic charader; which, not being 
exprcifed in the Title, we forbear the Expla- 
nation of here, as we fhall give it in the 
Chapter allotted for this Clafs. 

Class XIII. P LT J N D RI A.^ 
This Term imports, that the Flowers have 
manv Stamina. 

Class XIV. DIDrNAMIA.--Th[5 
Term figniiies the Poiver or Superiority 
oitvoQ-, and is applied to this Clafs, becaufe 
its Flowers have four Stamina, of which 
there are tvvo longer than the reft : This 
Circumftance alone is fufficient todiftinguiih 
this Clafs from the fourth, where the four 
Stamina are equal ; but the Flowers of this 
Clafs have aUb their particular Charadter,

rolla; being moftly Rhigent, as will be fhewn

Class XV. 7ETRyiDrN^MI^,â€”Th\s 
Term exprefles the Power or Superi- 
ority offour ; and accordingly there are in 
the Flowers of this Clafs fix Stamina, four 
of which are longer than the red ; which 
Circumftance diftinguifhes them from thofe 
of the fixth Clafs, where the fix Staminaare 
equal : But thefe Flowers have their parti- 
cular Charader alfo, their Corollse being 
Cruciform f. 

Class XVI. MONADELPHIA.~Tht 
Word here, compounded with the nu- 
merical Term, fignifies a Brother. This 
Relation is employed to exprefs the Union 
of the Filaments of ihe Stamina, which in 
this Clafs do not ftand feparate, but join at 
the Bafe, and form one Subftance, out of 
which they proceed as from a common Mo- 
ther j and the Title of the Clafs exprefles a 
y/Â«^Z? Brotherhood, meaning that there is but 
(3Â«f Set of Stamina fo united, which difl;in-

ner explained in the preceding Clafs. The

Flowers ot this Clafs have a very particular

Term is compounded of two Words, that 
fignify ^F(/'e and Hiipand; and alludes to the 
fmgular Circumftance of this Clafs, in the 
Flowers of which the Stamina grow upon 
the Piflillum ; fo that the male and female 
Parts are united, and do not (land feparate, 
as in other Hermaphrodite Flowers. 

Class XXI. MO NO EC 1 ^.â€”The 
Word here, compounded with the numeri- 
cal Term, fignllies a Houfe or Habitat'ioju 
To underftandthe Application of this Title, 
we muftknow, that the Plants of this Clafs 
are not Hermaphrodite but Androgynous -|-, 
the Flowers that have the Stamina wanting 
the PiftlUum, and thole that have the Pif- 
tillum wanting the Stamina. Now the Term 
Monoecia^ which fignilies a/Â«^/cHoufe, al- 
ludes to this Circumftance ; that in this Clafs 
the male and female Flowers are both found 
on the Jcime Plant, whereas in the next they

nous Clafs Monoecia lafl; explained. 

Class XXIII. POLTGAMIA.-^ 
The Term fignifies Plurality oi Marriages, 
This Clafs produces, either upon the fame 
or different Plants, Hermaphrodite Flowers, 
and alfo Flowers o{one Sex only, be it male 
or female ; or Flowers of each Sex ; and the 
latter receiving' Impregnation from, or giv- 
iiig it to the Hermaphrodites, as their Sex 
happens to be, the Parts eflential to Gene- 
ration in the Hermaphrodite Flowers do not 
connne themfelvestothe correfponding Parts 
â– within the fai'ne Flower, but become oi pro- 
mifcuous^Jie -, which is the Reafon of giving 
this Title to the Clafs.

Explanation of the Titles of the Order?. 

TH E Titles of the Orders have been 
given in Chap, j . It remains to ex- 
plain them. 

Class I. to XIII. inclufive. â€” The Or- 
ders of the firft thirteen ClafTes take theii 
Denominations from the Number of the 
Pijiillum, or Female Part of the Plant, which 
is ufually reckoned from the Baje of the 
Style, if there be any; but if the Style be 
wanting, the Number is fixt from the Stig- 
mata. The Greek Word, compounded with 
the numerical Terms in the Titles of thef|i 
Orders, figuifies a Wife: Mono^ynia im^Xit'i 
one JViJe or one Style ; Digynia, two Styles ; 
Trigynia, three y Tetragynia^ four ; Peiita- 
gynia, frve ; Hexagynia, fix ; Decagynia, 
ten ; and Pohgynia, many. Thefe are the 
Titles that occur in the Orders of thefe thir- 
teen ClafTes ; and this general Explanation 
of them will be thought fufBcient, as from 
the Table given in the firft Chapter it ap- 
pears how they are employed in the ClafTes. 

Class XIV. DIDYNAMIA.â€”Oi the 
three Orders of this Clafs the two firft 

G 3 - arg 



86 AN INTRODUCTION 

are founded On a Diftinftion in the Fruit, 
The Title of the firft Order, Gymmjpermia^ is 
expreffive of fuch Phints as have naked Seeds ; 
and that of the fecond, Aiigiofpertfiia^oi {\xch. 
as have their Seeds in a Fe[fel or Piricarpium. 
The third Order, Polypetala, is expreffive of 
fuch Plants as have many Petals: This Or- 
der feems to have been eflablilhed in Favor 
of one Genus of Plants only, the Meliantkus, 
the Flowers of which are Pclypetalcm, though 
thofe of all the reft of this Clafs are Mam- 
petalous *. 

CLAss:^Y.rErRADrNAMIA. 
â€” The two Orders of this Clafs are founded 
on a Diftintflion in the Pericarpium. In the 
firft Order, Siliculoj'a, the Pericarpium is a 
Silicuhy little Siliqua^; which differs from 
the Siiiqtia in being round, and having the 
Apex of the Diffepiment, which had been 
the Style, prominent beyond the Valves, 
often fo far as to be equal in Length to the 
Silicula. In the fecond Order, SHiqucfa, 
the Pericarpium is a Siliqua^ which is long 
and without any remarkable Extenfion of 
the Style. 

â€¢ Tliis Order is omittad in the Syjl-ma Katurtp, pub- 
liTred in 1756. See the Note on tliisOrdcr in Chapter 
17. 

Q Class 



TO BOTANY. 87 

Class XVI. MONADELPHA. XVII. 
DIADELPHIA. XVIII. POLTADEL- 
PHIA. The Orders of thefe three Claflcs 
are founded on the Number of the Stamina 
in each Brotherhood or diftiniS: Set of Sta- 
mina. The Titles of the Orders being the 
fame that are ufed for the Titles of the early 
ClafTes of the Syftem, the Explanation need 

not be repeated here. 

Class X\X. S T N G E N E S IA.â€”1:o 

underftand the orders of this Clafs, we muft 
. explain what is meant by Pohgawy in Flow- 
ers. We have already treated of polyga- 
mous Plant<i, and fliewn that the Term 
Polygamous, as there applied, alluded to the 
Intercommunication of the male or female 
Flowers with the Hermaphrodite ones, ei- 
ther upon the fame or a diftind Plant : But 
in refpedl to Flowers, the Term is applied 
to a fmgle Flower only ; for the Flowers of 
this Clafs being Compound, a Polygamy 
arifes from the Intercommunication oi the 
feveral Florets in one and the fame Flower. 
Now the Polygamy of Flowers, in this Senfe 
of the Word, affords four Cafes, which are 
the Foundations of the four firft Orders of 
this Clafs. I ft. Order, Pohgamia aqiuilis, 
equal Polygamy^ is when all the Florets are 
Hermaphrodite, zd. Order, Polygamia fuper- 

G 4 Jlua, 



88 AN INTRODUCTION 

jlua, fuperfluous Polygamy^ when fome of the 
Florets are Hermaphrodite, and others Fe- 
male only ; for in this Cafe, as the Frudi- 
fication is perfeded in the Hermaphrodites, 
tat Addition of the Females is a Super- 
fluity. 3d. Order, Polygamiafrujlranea^fnif- 
traneoui or itiejfcclual Folvgamy, when fome 
of the Florets are Hermaphrodite, and others 
Neuter ; for in this Cafe the Addition of the 
Neuters is of no AlTiftance to the Frudifi- 
cation. 4th. Order, Pol^gamia necejjaria, ne- 
cefjary Polygamy, when fome of the Florets 
are Mak, and the reft Female ; for in this 
Cafe there being no Hermaphrodites, the 
Polygamy arifing from the Compofition of 
the Florets of different Sexes is Jiecejfary to 
perfed the Fructification. 5th Order, Po- 
lygamiajlgregata. The Title fignifies to be 
feparated, the Plants of this Order having 
partial Cups growing out of the common 
Calyx which furround and divide the Flof- 
culi or Florets. 6th Order, Monogatnia : 
The Title fignifies a y/w^/t- Marriage, and is 
oppofed to the Polygamia of the four other 
Orders ; for in this, though the Anthera: 
are united, which is the cffential Charader 
of the Flowers of this Clafs, the Flower is 
fimple., and not compounded o^many Florets, 
as in the other Orders.

ders of this Clafs are founded on the Num- 
ber of Stamina. The Titles have been al- 
ready explained. 

Class XXI. MONOECLl. XXII. 
DIOECIA. Thefe two ClafTes, whofe 
Flowers have no fixt Charader but that of 
not being Hermaphrodite, take in the Cha- 
raders of almoft every other Clafs ; and the 
Orders have accordingly been difpofed under 
the Titles of thofe Claffes, to which their 
refpedive Flowers would have belonged, if 
the Stamina and Piftillum had been under 
the fame Covers: As the Explanation of all 
thefe Titles has been given in the lafl: Chap- 
ter in the Explanation of the Claffes, it 
need not be repeated here. 

Class XXIII. POLTGAMIA. In this 
Clafs the Titles of the two firft Orders are 
the fame with the Titles of the twenty-firfl: 
and twenty- fecond Claffes, and are to beun- 
derftood in the fame Manner; that is, i, 
Monoecia, when the Polygamy is on the fame 
plant ; and, 2. Dioecia, when it is on dtftinEl 
Plants. The Order Trioecia has been efta- 
blifhed in Favour of a fingle Genus, the Fi- 
cus ; in which the Polygamy is on three dif- 
tin(fl Plants, one producing Male Flowers, 

another

Orders of this Clafs are, i. Filices^ Ferns, 
2. Miifii, Mojfcs. 3. yUgce, Flags ; and 4. 
Fu?igt\ Mujhrooms. As the I-^xplanation of 
the Charader of thefe Orders will come

ourfelves here with having interpreted the 
Titles as above.

the Flofculi, Florets, of which it is com- 
pofed. We fhall begin with the firft, which 
concerns only the Calyx and Receptacle, 
thofe being the only Parts that are in com- 
mon. 

Characters of the Flofculofe Flower. 

CALYX â€” The common Calyx is a Perl- 
anthium, which contains the Florets and the 
Receptacle. It is either Jmplc, avgmeiitedj 
or imhricated *. It contrads when the Flow- 
ers are fallen, but expands and turns back 
when the Seeds are ripe. 

RFCEPTACLEâ€” The common Recep- 
tacle of the Frudlification receives many fef- 
fi!e Florets on its Diik which is either con- 
cave, plane, ccn'vex, pyramidal, or globojc. The 
Surface of the Difk is either naked, without 
any other inequality than that of being 
lightly dotted ; VilloJ'e, covered with upright 
Hairs ; or Faleaceom, covered with Palecc^ 
Chaffs, or Siraivs, that are linear, fubulate, 
comprefled, and eretit, and ferve to part the 
Florets. 

Characters of the Florets f . 
CALYX â€” A fmall Perianthium, often 
quinquepartite, feated on the Germen, per- 

fifting,

fifting, and becoming the Crown of the 
Seed. 

COROLLA â€” Monopetalous with a long 
and very narrow 1 ube. It is feated on the 
Germen, and is either tubulate, with the 
Limb car-npanulate and quinquefid and the 
LaciniaD fpreadingand turning back; Itgiilate, 
with the Limb linear, plane, turned out- 
wards, and the Top whole ; tridcmate^ or 
qui nque dent ate ; or wanting, having no Limb, 
and often no Tube. 

STAMINAâ€” The Filaments five, capil- 
lary, very fliort, infeited in the Neck of the 
CTorolIul:^. The Antherae five, linear ered ; 
and by the Union of their Sides forming a 
Cylinder, that is tubulate, quinquedentate, 
and of the Length of the Limb. 

PISTILLUMâ€” The Germen oblong, 
placed under the Receptacle of tlie Flower ; 
the Style fi.iform,ercÂ£t, of theLength of the 
Stamina, and perforating the Cylinder of the 

ret ; but the Florets may alfo be either Male^ Female, or 
J^leute'-, as the Orders fliew ; it may not be improper 
therefore to obferve, in general, upon thefe ClafTicclia- 
racVers, which our Author has drawn with luch minute 
Exadlnefs, that they fliould be underilood as collcified 
only ftorn the Circumilances that moll frequently occur 
in the Clafs, and liable to Variation, not in particular 
Genera only, but even through the whole Oiders of the 
CUfs in fome C<ifes<

Anthersej the Stigma bipartite, the Laclnijc 
revokite and fpreading afunder. 

PERICARP lUMâ€” No true one, though 
infome there is a coriaceous * Crult. 

SEED â€” A fingle one, oblong, often te- 
tragonous, but commonly narrower at the 
Bafe. It is either crowned, or with the 
Crown wanting. The Crown is of two 
Kinds, either a Pappus, or a Perianthium ; 
if a Pappus, it is either feffile, or placed on a 
Stipes J and confifts of many Radii, that are 
placed in a round, and are either fimplc, 
radiate, or ramofe; uhen the Crown is a 
Perianthium, it is fuch as is defcribed aboTC 
under that Head. 

The Effence of a Flofcu'ofe Flower confifts 
in having the Antherse united in a Cylinder, 
and a fingle Seed below the Receptacle of 
the Floret if. 1 he Orders of this Clafs are 
fix, viz. 

* Leathery. 

:]: That the Effence of -xfiofculofe or compound Flower 
does not confift either in the common Calyx or Recep- 
tacle Linnatis argues from hence. That the common 
Calyx is wanting in Echinops, and the common Recep- 
tacle in Millena, though both thofe Genera belong to 
this Clafs; and iliat on the other Hand, the common 
Calyx is found in Scabiofa, and the common Receptacle 
in Dipjacus, both which Plants belong to the Clafs Te- 
tratidrin, though they have, with the Gomphrena and 
othcrSj been fallly ranged with the compound Flowers.

f To underft-ind this Oder, fhe fingula rMjnner of 
the Fructification mud be explained. The Fruit of the 
F'uus is not a Ptriiorpuim, but a RtceptacU, the ii:terior 
Sides of which fupport the Flovt'ets, which by this 
Means are indofed wiihin it. 1 hcfc Flowers in the 
cultivated Fig-trees slvs female only, but there is a Sort 
known by the Name of Cap> ificui, that has male Flowers, 
and another again called Kri>iof\ce, which is and'oiynoui^ 
having both wale and femde Flowers diltmcl, though 
lodged within the fame Receptacle. Here then we have 
the Trioecieus Polygamy explained ; and if the Dclcrip- 
tions of de La Hire may be trufteri, there are Figs that 
contain Hcimaphroditc Flowers i which give us even a 
foutth Habitation for the Sexes. 'Fhus much fufEces to 
explain the Order ; but ilitre is an ObjeÂ£lion naturally 
ariling from hence to the Dcitlrine of the Sexes ; the 
'obviating which, will fuinifli the Opportunity of a iie- 
celT.iry Remark. It will be alked, How it happens that 
the Fruit of our Fig-trcc'; ripen, if the Plants are of one 
Sex only, and h.ive no Affiilance from the Male ? The 
Anfwer is this; the Fruit is in all Cafes to be diftin- 
guifhed from ihe Seed contained within it : If the Male 
be wanting, the Seed will not vegetate when fown, but 
the Fruit may ncvcrthclefs fweU, and come to an Ap- 
pearance of Pcrfedioii ; and io it is obferved to do in 
the Inftance in Quellion, and in many others, efpecially 
where the Fruit is formed of one of the Parts Icfscon- 
neded with the Seed ; as Calyx, Receptacle, &c. though 
it is more common for it to drop off before It ripens, if 
oot impregnated by the Male.

HAVING now gone through the Ex- 
planation of the Claires and Orders 
of theSyftem, we come to the DiftinÂ£lions 
of the Genera. Thefe, by the Theory of 
the fexual Syftem, are to be regulated by 
the FruQification only. The Parts of Fruc- 
tification known to the earlier Botanills were 
few, and might be well thought infufficient 
for dlftinguilhing the vegetable Produdlions 
of Nature: They therefore had Recourfe 
to the Habit of Plants, and other Circum- 
Jlances; and by this Means a great Number 
of Genera were eftablifhed, which the new 
Syflem is obliged to rejedt. Of thefe we 
fliall give the Reader an ample Lift of In- 
ftances in Chapter 3 i . 

The Frudificition being admitted as the 
only Foundation of the generic Diftindions, 
all Vegetables that agree in their parts of 
Frudlification are to be put together under 
one Genus ; and all fuch as differ in thofe 
Parts are to be divided. The charaderiftic 
Mark of each Genus is to be fixed from the 
Number, Figure, Proportion, and Situation 

of 



TO BOTANY. 155 

f>{ all the Parts : But as there are few Ge- 
nera wherein all the Parts are conftant in 
every one of the Species, we ought, where- 
ever it is pofTible, to fix upon fome one iin- 
gleCircum (lance that is conllant, and make 
it the ejjhitial Characler. This in inoft 
Genera may be had : Thus the Elfence of 
Prunella^ Torenia., Euphrajia, Alyjfum^ and 
Crambe^ lies in the Denticles of the Stamina; 
that of Curcuina,Chi'one, H;gmnia,5..\^ Mar- 
tynia in a mutilate Stamen ; the Ranunculus 
is diftinguilhed by its Neftarinm, which is a 
Pore in the Claws ot its Petals; Hjdropbyl- 
lum by the fame Part, which in that Genus 
is a clofed Chink in the Lacinis; of the Co- 
rolla ; and Helleborm and Nigella alfo, by 
their tubulofe Neclaria; in Pancratium the 
Stamina are inferted in the Nedarium, 
which diftinguiQies it from Narcijfus-, in 
Hyjjcyarmii, there is a Covering to the Cap- 
fules, by which it is known from Plivfalis ; 
the Re/eda has always a lateral Neftarium, 
but varies in its Corolla and Piftillum ; the 
Campanula has a quinquevalved Kedtarium, 
but is inconflant in the Corolla and Capfule ; 
and laftly, the Iris has a Stigma of fingular 
Conftruftion, but varies in the Beard of its 
Corolla. 

There is, however, no one Part of Fruc- 
tification 



156 AN INTRODUCTION 

tificatioPx that can be relied on as a conftant 
charavf^eriilic JVIarkfor all Genera ; it being 
found, tliat the Part which is conftant in 
lome Genera will be inconflant in others : 
Thus in Carica the Flowers of the male 
Plant are monopetalous, and thofe of the fe- 
male pentapetnlous ; in Myrica fome Species 
have naked Seeds, others Berries ; in Fraxi- 
nus fome have a naked Flower, and others a 
Corolla; in Geranium fome have regular 
Corollae, and others irregular â€¢, in Lmiim 
fome are pentapetalous, others tetrapetalous ; 
in Aconitum fome are tricapfular, and others 
quinquecapfular ; and in Trifoliiim fome are 
monopetalous, others polypetalous, fome 
monofpcrmoas, and others polyfpermous. 

I'his Inconftancy of particular Parts in 
many Genera has been another Source of 
Frror amongft the eariier Botanifts ^ who 
have parted many Plants from their Conge- 
ners on this Account : Of thefe Miftakes 
wc ihall give an ample Lift in Chapter 32. 

When the charadcriftic Mark of any 
Genus is wanting in any particular Species, 
we fhould proceed with Caution, left we 
confound Genera that fhouid be diftinguifti- 
ed ; For want of this Caution the Erica and 
Andromeda had been joined, but were parted 
afterv/ards on Account of the two Horns in 
* 7 tlie 



TO BOTANY. 157 

the Anthers of the Erica; the Adonii had 
been joined to the Ranunculus^ but was part- 
ed from it again, on obferving that it want- 
ed the nedariferous Pore ; and the Aloe and 
Agave had been blsnded, till it was obferved 
that m the latter the Stamina were inferred 
in the Corolla, and not in the Receptacle. 

When the charaderiflic Mark of any Ge- 
nus is obferved in fome Species of another 
Genus near of Kin to it, a like Caution is 
again necefTary on the other Hand, left we 
fhould multiply the Genera by parting Spe- 
cies that fhould ftand together : Thus wd 
findj that in Sedum, Se?npervivum, Rhodiola, 
Crajfula, Tillaa and Cotyledon, the Necfiaria 
adhere to the Bafeofthe Piftillum; in Epi- 
lobium and Oerxtbcra the Calyx is tubulole â€¢ 
in Mejpilus, Cratagus, and Sor6us,the Struc- 
ture of the Flower is alike; and in both 
Alnus and BetuJa, there are three Florets on 
the Foliole of the Amentum*. 

* The Jlnus and Betula are joined by Linnaus under 
the Title of Betula. The reft of thefc Jnlbnces he has 
kept feparate, notwithllanding theDoubt raifed hcrecon- 
cerning the Fiopriety ol diftinguiflsing them.

By ivbat Parts of Fru^ijication the Genus 
may with the mojl Certainty be dctirmined. 

TH E more conflant any Part of the 
FruÂ£cification is found through the' 
feveral Species of any Genus, the more it 
may be relied on with Certainty as a cha- 
radteriftic Mark for that Genus : Thus \n 
Hypecoian the NeÂ£tarium is conftant, but not 
the Siliqua -, the Corrjallana is conftant in 
hs /potted BerrVy but not in its Co'^olla ; the 
Lobelia in its Corolla^ but not in its Fruit ; 
the CaJJia in its Corolla, but not in its Sili- 
qua ; and the Verbena in its Cat\x and Co- 
rolla, but not in its Stamina and Seeds. 

In fome Genera one Part of the Frudtifi- 
cation is found to be the moft conftant, and 
in others another ; but there is no Part that 
is not Hable fometimes to a Variation i 
Thus we find the Fericarpium variable in 
Impatiem, Campatiuh, Primula, Papaver., 
Cijlusi Fumaria, and Arbutus ; the dlyx in- 
Nymph^a, and Cornus; the Corolla in Vac- 
cinium, Convallaria, Andromeda, Gentiana, 
and Linum ; and the Seeds in Ranunculus^ 
and AliJ'ma. 

If 



TO BOTANY. 159 

If the Flowers agree, but the Friiiis dif- 
fer, the Genus ought not to be parted : Thus 
in thofe extenfive Genera, the Ca/Jia, HeJy- 
farum, Sopbora^ Lavatera, Hibijius, and A/;- 
moj'dy fo great a Number of Species have 
been ranged under the fame Genus, on Ac- 
count of the Conformity in the Flowers, 
though there is a Variation in the Fruit. 

That the Figure of the Flowers is more 
certain than that of the Fruity appears from 
many Examples ; as from Campanula, Pri~ 
tnuluy Antirrhinum^ AliJ/na^ llib'ifcus^ CiftuSy 
&c. but the Proportion of the Parts is fub- 
jedl to very great Variation. 

The Kuinher of the Parts is more liable 
to Variation than their Figure, and is found 
fometimes to vary even upon the fame Plant ; 
as in Rut a, Chryfcfplenium, Mcnotropa, Te- 
tragofiia, Euonymus, PbilaJelphus, and Adoxa, 
in the Flowers of all which the Number of 
the Parts varies from five to four : In thefe 
doubtfLd Cafes, the natural Number muft be 
coUeifted from the primary Flower ; but ia 
the Variations of the Number of the Parts, 
there is a proportional Affinity worth re- 
marking. In Flowers the Stamina ufually 
vary from ten to eight, and from five to four; 
the Corolla and Calyx from five to four, and 
the whole Flower from four to three ; and 

5 the 



i6o AN INTRODUCTION 

the Fruit alfo ufiially varies from five to 
three, and from five to four. 

The Sicuation of the Parts is the moft 
conflant^ very rarely varying in the fame 
Genus. 

The Rr'giilarity of tlic Petals is not fo 
much to be depended on as fome former 
Botanifts have * tnought; for we fee irt 
Geranium the European Species have regular 
Corolla:, but the African ones irregular. 

The NeSlarium Nature has made of the 
greateft Confequence. This Part, which 
had not even a Name till Linnaus had dif- 
tinguiflied it, is a decifive Mark in all the 
following Genera, viz. in Orchis, Satyrium, 
Monotropa, Fumaria, Vicla, Alalpighia, Ban- 
v.'ifleriat Aderumthera, Commelina, Laufui,

Refeda, Grewiai Hcllebcrtis, Ijopyrum, Trcpa-' 
(liaj], and Imp at i ens. 

â€¢ Rivlnui in particular. 

The 



t O B O T A N Y. i6i 

*rhe Stamina and Calyx, being lefs fiifcjedl 
to Luxuriancy, are far more certain than the 
Fetah. 

The Corolla varies as to its Figure in many 
Genera; as in Vacciniuni, Pyroia, Andromeda, 
Nicotiana, Menyant/ies, Primiilj, Veronica, 
Gentiana, Hyaciiithus^ Scabiofa^ and Narci/J'us. 
It varies alfo as to Numbc-, being in Ranun- 
culus, Pentapetalous in fome Species, and 
Polypetalous in others ; in Hellcbjrus alfo, 
Pentapetalous and Polypetalous j in Statice^ 
Pentapetalous and Monopetalous; and in 
Fumaria, Dipetalous and Tetrapetalous : and 
the number is alfo fometimes variable in the 
fame Species ; as is obferved in C.:rica, and 
'Jatropha. 

The Strudure of the Fericarpium was for- 
merly thought to be of great Confequence 
in determining the Genera ; but there are 
Examples without Number that demonftrate 
the contrary. There are a great many Ge- 
nera that have been eftablifhed on Diftinc- 
tions in the Pericarpium, and that are now 
rejeded ; of thefe we fhall give an ample 
Lift in Chap. .33.

allowed any place In determining the Gene- 
ra ; for in full Flowers no number of Pe- 
tals can be affigned, and the Stamina are ge- 
nerally wanting, the Number of which 
makes a Part of the Generic Charader; and 
in mutilate Flowers, as in fome Species of 
Campanula^ Jpomoca^ and Ruellia, the Corolla 
would be excluded from the Defcription, 
contrary to the Nature of the other Species 
of the Genus. But as the Calyx * in full 
Flowers is fcarce ever altered, it may detedl 
the Genus ; and the lowe:!: Series ot Petals 
in Polypetalous Corollas remaining the fame 
in refpecl to Number, the Genus may alfo 
be often known by that Charader j as in 
Pa paver, N'g<://a, and RoJ(i. 

* Some Syftematifts have diftrlbuted the whole Body 
of Vegetables by th; Differences of the Calyx ; and in 
fuch Syfteais the full Flowers, as our Author obferves, 
are more eafily referred to their proper Genus than in ViÂ» 
own, the Calyx not being fubjecl to Luxuriancy : In- 
ftan.:â‚¬s of this are ia Hijiatka, Ranunculus^ and /iUea.

Vegetables are each primarily divifible 
into, I. The Root. 2. The Herb or Plant 
itfelf. 3. The FruBifcation. Of thefe the 
laft has been already treated of in the firft 
Book : The two others, upon which the fpe- 
cific Differences of Vegetables more imme- 
diately depend, come now under Confidera- 
tion, and will be the Subject Matter of the

* Nature has put no Limits between a Tree and a 
Shrub, which is only a Vulgar DiflinÂ£lion. This Lin- 
Bitits acknowledges; and argues, that his own Diftindlion 
though he thinks it the be ft, is neverthelefs exception- 
able; inafmuch as there are feldom any Buds upon the 
large Trees in India ; all which muft therefore by this 
Definition, notwithftanding their great Height, be ranked 
vith Shrubs. 

f It may not be improper here to obviate an Objection 
that may be made to the Method purfued in this Work. 
It may be afked, if the Matter of this third Part would 
not have flood more properly in the firft. In anfwer to 
this it is admitted, that the Order of Nature would 
thereby have been more diredlly followed : But the De- 
flgn of this Work was not fo much to follow the Order 
of Nature, as to explain the Syftem oi L'nnaus; and as 
the Claftl-s, Orders, and Genera which come firft in the 
Syftem are jjrounded on the Fructification, the Begin-' 
ning with that Part of the Vegetable was indifpenfably

THE ROOT (wliofe 0{Cicc is to draw 
up Nourifliment, and which alfo pro- 
duces the Herb with its Frudification) con^ 
fills of two Parts, viz. Caitdex, the Stock or 
Body of the Root ; and Radicula^ the Radicle 
or little Root. 

CAUDEX, ihcBodv of the Root both af- 
cends and defcends. 

Theafcending Caudex raifes ilfelfgrldu- 
ally above Ground, ferving often as a Trunk, 
and produces the Herb or Plant *. 

The defcending Caudex ftrikes gradually 
downward into the Ground^ and puts forth 
Radicles. It has been diftinguifhed, accord- 
ing to its various Struflure, irlto 

Perpendicular, when itrunsdircdly down- 
wards. 

Horizontal, when It extends itfelf tranf- 
verfly under the Earth. 

* Linr.aus infers from hence, that all Trees and Shrubs 
are to be confidered as Roots above Ground ; and that 
this is the Reafon that Trees, when inverted, pur forth 
Leaves from the defcending Stem, and Roots from the 
afcending.

THE HERB is a Part of the Veget-

minated by the Fructification. It compre- 
hends, 

1 . The TRUNK^ which ferves to multi- 
ply the Herb, and leads immediately from 
the Root to the Frudification. It is c oath- 
ed with the Leaves, and terminated by the 
Fruditication. See Chap. 4. 

2. The LEAVES, whofe Office is to 
tranfpire and attradl, like the Lungs in Ani- 
mals, and to afford Shade. See Chap. 5, 
6, 7.

Form of the Circumference of Leaves where 
there'areno Angles orSinuations: In which 
r^fpeft. Leaves are, 

Orbiculate, rcimd; when the longitudinal

210 AN INTRODUCTION 

Buds are of various Kinds. In the Gene- 
rality of Plants, they are FolliferOyforiferous, 
producing both Leaves and Flowers; but in 
Alnus they bear Leaves only ; in Pcpulus^ 
Fraxinus, and feme Species of Salix, they 
bear Leeivcs diWiS. F/oivers diftinftly ; in Cory- 
Itis and Carpinus^ Le^ivcs^ind/emalc Flowers j 
in Pinusdindi Abies, Leaves and //w/? Flowers; 
and in Daphne, U/mus, Cornus, and Amygda- 
lus. Leaves and hermaphrodite Flowers. In 
Dentaria, Ornith-jgalum, Liliuni^ and Saxi- 
Jraga^ the Buds are deciduous. 

In feveral Plants there are Jio Buds ; as in 
Philadclpbus, Frangiday dlaternus, Paliurus,

In cold Countries there are but few Plants 
without Buds ; and in hot Countries but few 
that have any.

Of the Habit of Plafits. 

BY the PIABIT, or external Face of 
Plants, is to be undcrflood a certaia 
Conformity between Vegetables that belong 
to the fame Genus, or are near of Kin to 
each other*. This Conformity may be in 
refpeÂ£l to various Circumftances j as Plucen- 
tat ion. Radical ion y Ramification, bitorjion^ Gem- 

* This Definition of the H.ibit of Plants, which we 
have taken from the Phi ofophia Botanka, fcems to agree 
better with the olil State of Botany, when Plantj were 
adually ranged according to their external Face, than 
with tlie moilern Sydem that ranges them by the Fruc- 
tification : For Plants that by the Syfletn are neither of 
the fame Genus, nor have any fyltematic Affinity, will 
often have a great Conformity in their Habit; whillt 
thofe of the fame Genus rtiall have their Habits tlillinÂ£l. 
The Habits of Plants was the Invention of the earlier 
Botanifts, who knfew no better Rule for the Dillribution 
of Vegetables: And indeed Linnaui himfelf is induced 
to admit, that it is often a good Guide; and. that Caf- 
per Bauhine, and others, had in many Cafes difcovered 
the Affinity of Plants by the Habit, when Syftematilts 
had failed in attempting the fame by their artificiji Pvules; 
nor does he think even the Fruditication, wiiich ii ti>e 
Invention of the Moderns, fufficient for detecting all the 
Claffes of Vegetables, though he confiders it as the pri- 
mary Guide to the natural Method fo much fought after 
by thofe who have cultivated this Science.

Of Placentation. 

BY PLACENTATION * Is meant the 
Difpofition of the Cotyledons at the 
Time w hen the Seed is beginning to grow. 
Plants, in refpedl \.o Placentation, are termed, 

1. yiCOTrLEDONES, without Cotyle- 
dons^ when this Part is wanting; as in 
Mojfes. 

2. MONOCOTTLEDONES, with a//z- 
g!e Cotyledon f ; and thefe are either. 

Perforate ; as in GraJJes. 
Unilateral ; as in Palms ; or, 
'Reduced; as in Cepa. 

â€¢ The Cotyledons of the Seed in Vepetables anfwer the 
Purpofe of the Placenta in the Animal Oeconomy ; and 
hence the Difpofition of the Cotyledons is called Fiacert' 
tation. 

f Llnnaus obferves, that the jdonocotyledonei are pro- 
perly Acotyledones ; the Cotyledons remaining within the 
Seed.

RAMIFICATION is the Manner in 
which a Tree produces its Branches, 
with the Situation of which that of the 
Leaves is alfo conneded *. 

Some Plants have no Branches, tliough 
they have Leaves which are placed on the 
Stem. This is the Cafe with DiBamnus, 
Pcso7iia^ Epimcdiumt and Podophyllum. 



* The Doflrines delivered here under the Head of 
Ramification do not anfwer to the Title, the greater Part 
refpefting rather the Situation of the Leavet than that of 
the Branchei : They might, with more Iropriety, have 
been colicfled under a Head of Foliation ; but as the 
Term Foliation is ufed to exprefs the Habit of Phiits, in 
refpeft to the Pofition of Leaves in the Bud before they 
difclofe themfelves, as will be fhesvn in Chanter i6. thefe 
Dodlrines could not have flood under the fame Head, 
without a Confufion in the IJfe of the Term ; and this 
feems to be the Reafon why Linnaus, whom we foi.ow, 
has given them in this Place.

Â»i6 AN INTRODUCTION 

Leaves oppofite or alternate are generally a 
Mark of great DifFerence in Plants : A few 
Genera however muft be excepted, which 
have fome Species with oppolke Leaves, and 
others with alternate; as in Euphorbia, 
Cijlust Lantana, Antirrhinum, Lilium, and 
Epilobium. 

In Antirrhinum; yafminum, Veronica and 
Borage, the lower Leaves at the Branches 
are oppojite^ and the upper ones at the 
Flowers alternate. 

In Potentillafiipina, and in Potamogiiony 
the lower Leaves are alternate^ and the up- 
per ones on the Branches oppofite. 

In Nerimn the lower Leaves are cppofitCy 
and the upper ones tern. 

In Rufcus the lower Leaves are tern, and 
the upper ones alternate. 

In Coreopfis alternifoiia, and in Antirrki- 
num chalepenje^ the lower Leaves are quatern, 
and the upper ones alternate. 

The natural Situation of the Leaves in 
Plants that are much branched is beft con- 
cluded from the radical Leaves.

Cy Specific Distinctions. 

WE have treated of Generic Differences 
in the five laft Chapters of the fe- 
cond Part of this Work ; we come now to 
treat of the S^ecijic ones. For this a Foun- 
dation has been laid in the preceding Chap- 
ters of this third Part, by the Explanation 
of thofe Parts of the Vegetable, on which 
the Difference of the Species moft com- 
monly depends ; but it is neceffary to ob- 
ferve, that the Frudification which we treat- 
ed of in the firfl: Part, as preparatory to the 
Diftinftions of the Claffes and Genera, has 
its Influence likewife in many Cafes upon 
the Species, as will appear in the Courfe of 
this Chapter. 

Generic Differences we have fhewn to 
depend on the Form of the Frudlification, 
and to be confined to that alone: Specific 
Differences take their Rife from any Cir- 
cumflance, wherein Plants of the fame Ge- 
nus are found to difagree j provided fuch 
Circumftance is conftant, and not liable to 
Alteration by Culture or other Accidents. 

Hence 



236 AN INTRODUCTION 

Hence Linnceus aflerts, the Species to be as 
many as there were different Forms of Ve- 
getables produced at the Creation; and con- 
fiders all cafual Differences as Varieties of 
the fame Species. 

Towards the End of the lafl: Century, the 
Defire of increafing the Number of Plants 
had fo feized the Botanifts of that Time, 
that new Species were eftablifhed on too 
flight Differenees, to the great Detriment of 
the Science ; and the fame Eagernefs led 
them alfo to fet down as new Genera what 
fhould have been Species only. This Evil 
was in fome Meafure unavoidable, whilfl 
there were no fixt Principles for the Regu- 
lation of the Science in this refpedl. A Re- 
medy to it was firff attempted by Vaillant ; 
afterwards by Juffien, Haller^ Royenus^ Gro- 
fiivius, and others ; and laflly by Linneeus, 
whofe Aphorifms have brought the Work 
much nearer to Perfedtion. Something in- 
deed feems flill wanting to complete thefe 
Doctrines ; but perhaps more is not to be 
expefledtill this Branch of natural Philofo- 
phy receives farther Affiftance from Expe- 
riment. 

We (hall treat in this Chapter of thofe 
Circumftances by which Species are diftin- 

guiflied 



TO BOTANY. 237 

guilhed with Certainty, refcrving the Va- 
rieties for the Chapter following. 

The ROOT often affords a real fpecific 
Difference *, and is fometimes the chief Dif- 
tindion; as in ^ci/la^ where the Species are 
fcarce to be diftinguiflied, but by the Bulbs 
being tioiicatejolid, ox fquamoje ; and in Or- 
chis^ where the Species are known by the 
Roots htxngjibrofe^ rounds or tefliculate \ but 
as Accefs cannot always be conveniently had 
to this Part of the Plant, it is better to fix 
the fpecific Diftindtion on fome other Cir- 
cumftance, if the Cafe will admit of it. 

The TRUNK often furniflies a fure 
Mark of Diftindlion. Thus in Hypericumfy 
ConvalkriaXi and Hedyfarum\\, there are 

* In Fumarla bulbofa, the greater and lefs Sorts with 
a hollow Root, and the greater and lefs Sorts with a Root 
nit hollow, appear by the whole Habit of the Plants 
to be Varieties only, as will be obferved in the next

many Species diftlnguifhable by the Angles 
of the Stem ; and in Lupinus, the Species are 
not eafy to be known, except by the fame 
Part being fiiuple or compound. In Eriocau~ 
Ion, the moft remarkable Difference is in the 
Culmusy which is quinquangular, hexangular^ 
decangular, &c. In Pyrola, fome Species are 
diftinguiihed by a triquetrous Scapus. In 
Citrus, the Aurantium is diflinguifhed from 
its Congeners by its Petioles, which are 
winged or increaled by a Membrane on each 
Side J and in Gomphrena, there is a Species* 
diftinguifhed by its Peduncles which are Di- 
phyllous, being furnifhed with two oppofite 
Folioles that are placed under the Head of 
the Flowers. 

The LEAVES exhibit moft natural and 
alfo m> ft elegant fpecific Differences. Thefc 
have been fo amply treated off already, that 
it would be only Repetition to particularize 
or exemplify the numerous Cafes that occur 
of fuch Dillindions. 

FULCRA are generally a good Mark of 
Diftinction, and muft be carefully attended 
to by the Botanift for the Determination of 
the Species; as we (hall (hew by many Ex-

amples, where the Difference confifts prin- 
cipally in thofe Parts of the Plant. Thus, 
Aciiki are remarkable in Rubus. 
Spines in Pruuus. 

Bra^ece in Fuman'a, Dracocephalon^ and 
the Indian Species of Hedyfarum ; to which 
muft be added the Co;;m, which is a bufliy 
Head, compofed of BraSiece that are of a 
large Size, and terminate the Stem in Ccronn 
impcrialis, Lavandula, and Salvia. 

Glandules furnifti the effential Mark in 
Padus^ Urenaj Mimoja, Cajfia, and many- 
other Genera, which it would be impofTible 
to diflinguifh without being acquainted with 
this Part. They are found on the Serra- 
tures at the Bafe of the Leaves in Heliocar- 
f>us, Sa/ix, and Amygdahs ; on the Back of 
the Leaves in Padus, Urena, and PaJJiJlora ; 
and oniht Aculei inBauhinia aculeata, where 
by the Apex of the Acuki a Liquor is fe- 
creted. The Amygdalus is dilHnguifhed from 
Perfica only by the Glandules of the Serra- 
tures ; nor could the Species of Urena be ever 
fixed without examining the Glandules of 
the Leaves. The Convolvulus with a tuber- 
culate Calyx, is fo variable in the Shape of 
its Leaves, that it feems divifible into many 
Species, yet is kept together by the Glan- 
Mes: And there is a Species of Monarda^

diflinguifliable from its Congeners by thsi 
Glandules, that are fprinkled over the 
Corolla. 

Stipuke are of great confequence in many 
extenfive Genera, where the Species are li- 
able to Confufion. Thus in one Species of 
Melanthus the Stipules are foliiary \ in the 
other they are in Vain ; and the Cajjia auri-' 
culata is rendered diftinct from all its Con- 
geners by the Shape of its Stipula^ which are 
renijorm and barbate. 

HTBERNACLES afford likewife a cer- 
tain fpccific Difference. 

That Gems or Buds often differ greatly in 
the fame Genus is proved by Rhamnm ; ia 
which the various Species, viz. Cervifpina, 
Alaternus, Paliurus, and Frangula, have all 
a Difference in their Buds ; and in that ex- 
tenfive and intricate Genus the Sulixy the 
Species are by the Strudure and Foliation 
of the Buds diftinguifhed with great Cer- 
tainty. 

Bulbs alfo diftlnguifli the Species, as Is 
proved by Scilla, where they afford a real, 
and almoft the only Diftindion; and by their 
Situation in the AxilUz of the Leaves, they 
determine Dentaria^ Liliumy Ornithogalum, 
Saxifraga, and Bijiorta.

without which Chairacflers there would be 
no Certainty of the Species.

the Foundation of the Charaders of Info-

THE colleding of VARIETIES \^nitx 
their proper Species, is a Work no 
iefs necefiary than that of colleding the 
feveral Species under their proper Genus. 
We have obferved in the laft Chapter, that 
fuch Differences are only incidental to Ve- 
getables, and are not found conftant and un- 
changeable in them, are to be conhdered as 
Varieties only. Thefe Varieties are grounded 
chiefly on the following Circumftanccs, viz. 
SeXy Magnitude^ Time of Flowering, Color^ 
Scent, Tajle, Virtues and Ufes, Duration, 
Multitude, Fuhefcence; Leaves, and mcvftrous 
'Flowers. Of all which we flia.l treat ia 
their Order. 

1 he SEX of Plants in the Oafs Dioecia 
affords a Variety of all others the moff na- 
tural ; for the male and female Flowers in 
this C lafs being upon different Plants, thefe 
laft are diftinguifhed by the Frudification 
though the Species is the fame in both. 
But it mufl be obferved, that this kind of 
Variety holds only in the Clafs Dioecia; for 
R 4 in 



248 AN INTRODUCTION 

in the Genera that belong to any of the her- 
maphrodite Claffes, the fame Circumftance, 
whenever it happens, becomes a fpecific 
Diftindion : Thus in Rumex, which belongs 
to the Clafs Hexandria, the Acetofa and 
Acetojeiia^ being dioecious Plants, that is, 
having their male and female Flowers on 
diftind: Roots, thefe Species are thereby 
diftinguifhed from the reft of the Genus. 

MAGNITUDE is no fpecific Difference, 
but a Variety, being liable to Alteration 
from the Soil or Climate. 

The TIME of flowering is a treacherous 
Mark of a diftindt i: pedes j and, unlefs fup- 
ported by other Diftindions, can only be 
confidered as a Variety. 

COLOR is found fo changeable in the 
fame Species, that it muft be confidered as a 
Variety only. 

In Fhivers the Color is moft variable i as 
in Tiilipa, Hepatica, Cyanus, Campanula, A- 
qiiilegia, Viola, Galega, Fumaria, and others, 
which it would be tedious to enumerate : 
The moft ufual Change is from Blue or Red 
to V/lnte- The trifling Diftindions which 
have been made by Antkophili (Florijis) in 
fome of the Genera we have here inftanced, 
from the Colors of the Corollx, and to

SCENT 



TO BOTANY 251 

SCENT in Plants is, of all other Cir- 
cumftances, the leaft to be depended on; 
and therefore all Species grounded on a Dif- 
tindion in the Scent only, are to be rejected, 
and referred to Varieties. 

TASTE in Plants is a Circumftance va- 
riable from Soil or Culture; and not to be 
depended on as a real Difference. The 
Dirtindiions of Gardeners in Fruit of the 
fame Species, is confidered by Linnaus as a 
Variety too minute even to enter the Pro- 
vince of Botany ; and therefore the variousi 
, Names *, which have been given to thefe 
Diftindions, are to be negkaed as imper- 
tinent in this Science; though, for the Pur- 
pofes of Gardening, they have their Ufe. 

The VllWJES and' USES of Plants 
furnifh no fpecific Difference ; and the Difr 
tincllons therefore of phyfical Writers are 
not always to be depended on. 

The DURATION of Plants is no fure 
Mark of diftinct Species, being often owing 
rather to the Place tlian to the Nature of 
the Plant. In warm Regions, Plants that

MULTITUDE or Quantity, is an acci- 
dental Circumllance in Plants, and cannot 
conclude any Thing, whether the Increafe 
be of the Plant itfelf, or of its Roots, Siemst 
Leaves, or FruBification. 

PUBESCENCE is an uncertain Maris: ; 
as by Culture and Change of Soil, Plants 
are fubjcd to lofc as well their Spines as 
their Hair or Dcivn. 

LEAVES^ though they for the moft part 
furnifh moft elegant fpecific Differences, 
as has been obferved in the laft Chapter, are 
yet fubjecl to Luxuriation in the fame Spe- 
cies, which muft be carefully diflinguiftied. 
This may refpeft their Oppoftion and Com- 
pofitiofh and alfo their being crifp (curled J

Crijp, curled Leaves, are a very frequent 
Variety. In Tafiacetum^ Mentha, Ocymum,

there is this Singularity oblervable, that 
when the Leaves are curled, the Scent is 
heightened by the Crifpatiire J. 

Bu'latc, bladdery Leaves are generally pro- 
duced from fuch as are rugoje, itrinkied',

that the Valerians here fpoken of arc all of the

of them parted, although there is fo remark- 
able a Diverfity in the Fruit of the Indi- 
viduals. In the Medicngo * in particular, the 
Forms of the real Snails, which Nature has 
imitated in thefe Plants, are fcarce more 
diverfified than is the Fruit of this mimic 
Species ; fo that the Botanift, who is ftu- 
dious of Varieties, would hardly find any 
End to his Labour, of purfuing Nature 
through the various Shapes which llie has fo 
wantonly adopted. 

The whole Order of the Fungi, to the 
Scandal of the Science, is ftill a Chaos, the 
Botanifts not being yet able in thefe to de- 
cide with Certainty what is a Species, and 
what a Variety.

tLxpIanation of the Tables, iv'ith fame 
Hints concerning the Manner of Jhidying 
the Science of Botany by the help of this 
Book. 

TH E firfl: Table is divided into' three 
Columns ; the firft of which contains 
the Names of the Genera admitted by Lin- 
nctus, alphabetically difpofed; the fecond, the 
EngliJI:) Names, where there are any that 
have been commonly received ; and the lafl:, 
the Names of the Clafles and Orders, to 
which the Genera refpedively belong. 

The fecond Table is likewife divided into 
three Columns j the firll of which contains 
the generic Names that are now out of Ufe, 
alphabetically difpofed ; the fecond, the 
EngUfj Names that have been given to them j 
and the third, the Names of the Linncean 
Genera, under which they are refpedlively 
to be fought in the firft Table. 

By the Help of thefe Tables, the Reader 
will be enabled to find the Clafs and Order 
of any Plant he may propofe to examine, 
after he has informed himfelf of its botanic 
Name : For if the Name given him be not 
the fame admitted by the Author we have 

S 2 followed. 



266 EXPLANATION 

followed, and confeqaently not to be met 
vith in the firll: Table, he will probably 
find it in the fecond, which will refer him 
to the firll:. 

By thefe Tables, properly ufed, in Con- 
jundion with the Book itfelf, it is con- 
ceived, that the Reader may arrive not only 
ft an Acquaintance with the Principles of 
the Science, but even at a pradical Know- 
ledge of the Dillin&ons of Vegetables, much 
fooner than He could by reading the Defcrip- 
tions, and infpeding the Figures given by 
old Writers, whofe Colleftions are either 
without Method, or difpofed according to 
fuch Syflems as have been exploded j for by 
what we have laid before him, he will be 
enabled to confult the ProduiSlions of Na- 
ture, and compare them with what is de- 
livered in the Book ; or, in other Words, to. 
mix the Prai!lice with the Theory j without 
which the Study of this Science would bÂ© 
dry and tallelefs, and the progrefs made in 
it of little Advantage. As we cannot but 
recommend this ufeful Amufement to the 
Reader in the ftrongeft Manner, fo we (hall 
attempt to affift him farther, by a few Hints 
for the methodizing of his Endeavours. 

The firll thing he fliould aim at is, to 
get a thorough Knowledge of the Diftinc- 

tions 



O F T H E T A B L E S. 261 

tlons of the twenty- four Clafles. In order 
to this, the firft Part of this Hook fliould 
be previoully perufed, as the Parts of Fruc- 
tification are therein explained; without 
which the Clafles could not be underftood. 
Then let him gather fome of the ordinary 
Flowers, fuch as the Bloffoms of the P>uit- 
garden or Kitchen-ground, or the orna- 
mental Flowers of his Borders, and bring 
them by turns into his Clofet for Examina- 
tion, chufing firit the larger Kinds, and fuch 
as naturally expand and difcover the Stami- 
na and PiftlUum j and when he has accuf- 
tomed himfelf to know the Parts of Fruc- 
tification in thefe eafier Kinds, he may 
then try fuch as require being flript of their 
Covers, or differed with a Penknife, to dif- 
cover their inner Parts, or whofe Minutenefs"" 
requires the Affiftance of a magnifying Glafs 
for the obferving them properly. The 
double Flowers fhould be avoided, as being 
unnatural. Having fixed on the Flower he 
would firft examine, he will, by the Help of 
the Tables, be informed of the Clafs it be- 
longs to ; then turning to the Chapter of 
the fecond Part of the Book, which treats of 
that Clafs, let him carefully read over the 
Charafter there given of the Clafs, and 
cocnpaj-e his Flower therewith 3 a frequent 

S 3 Practice 



262 EXPLANATION 

Practice of this will foon make him retail 
the Names of the Clafies, and their feveral 
Dirtindions. 

When he has arrived thus far, he may be- 
gin to try his Strength, by deciding always 
firll himfelf upon the Clafs, before he turns 
to the Book > and he will be now qualified 
to begin the Study of the Orders ; which 
he may purfue after the fame Method as he 
did the Clafles, finding the Orders out firfi: 
by the Tables, reading their Charadlers, and 
comparing them with the Flower, till he 
has gained a clear Notion of their feveral 
DilVinftions ; after which he (hould in like 
manner attempt to declare the Order him- 
felf. 

Thefe Subdivifions alfo of the Orders, tho' 
they are not made Part of the fyflematic Di- 
idribution of Vegetables, are yet well worth 
his Attention ; as in fome of the extenfive 
Orders it would be more troublefome to de- 
tedl the Genus of any Flower, if the Genera 
contained in the Order were not parcelled 
out under fuch convenient Diftindlions. By 
thefe Divifions, the Reader will be led to 
decide on any Plant within a very few Ge- 
nera. And here we mull take our Leave of 
him, and refer the reft of the Work to his 
own Induftryj for though we have laid

down the Principles of both generic and 
fpecinc Diftindlions, the former in the le- 
cond, and the latter in the third Part of this 
Work, yet it was impoffible to include even 
the Characters of the Genera in a Work of 
this Compafs, much lefs to have entered 
up6n an Enumeration or Defcription of the 
feveral Species.
