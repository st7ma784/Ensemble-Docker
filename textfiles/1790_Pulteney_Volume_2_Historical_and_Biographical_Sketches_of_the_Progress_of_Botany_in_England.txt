Of Dt. James Cakgill, of Aberdeen, 
1 can produce no material anecdotes, al- 
though he merits particular remembrance ; 
fince it is manifefl, from the nature of his 
communications to his friends, both on the 
continent, and at home, that he muft have 
been extremely well acquainted with the bo- 
tany of the age. There ia fufficient evidence 
iStii^ he had fl:u£ed botany and anatomy at 
Mafilf during the time that Cafpar Bauhin& 
iield the jirofefibrflup in thofe fciences, for 
^hom a^tbair was firft erected in that city,

refpe<3:able terms> as a philofopher, and a^ 
well fkilled in the fciences of botany and^

in the year 1603 j at which time he fent tc*

not of any publication from Dr.CARGiLL^ 
neither am I acquainted with any fuccefsful 
efforts in the way of natural hiflory, before 
the time of the BALFOitRS. 

The founding of the Botariical (jardcix

litcraturcj, by Sir Jacob and Sir Andrelx^ 
Balfour. 

Tlie Garden was cftablilhcd about the 
year 1680 ; and, in 1683, was fo fucceff- 
fully cultivated hy James Sutherland, 
the intendant, that it is faid tp have con- 
tained 3000 fpecies of plants, difpofcd ac- 
cording to Morison's method. An ac- 
count of it was publifhed under the title 
of ^* Hortus Medicus Edinburgen- 
*^ SIS; or, a Catalogue of the Plants in the 
" Phyfic Garden at Edinburgh^ containing 
*' their moil proper Latin' and Englijb 
*' names/* By James Sutherland. 8% 
pp. 367.. Varieties, however, occupy a 
large fhare of this Catalogue, and very few 
of the native plants of Scotland are found 
in it. It was to Sir Robert Sibbald that 
the firft attempts towards indigenous .bo- 
tany were owing. 

Robert Sibbald was a fellow of the, 
College of Phyficians at Edinburghy and 
the firft medical profeflbr inftituted in that 
univerfity, about the year 1685. He was 
knighted by Charles II. and had alfo the 
title of king's phyfician and geographer 
§ royal 



' " Bibhald^ ^ 

wyal conferred upon him, and was a man 
of very confiderable and various learning/ 
To the knowledge of his profcffiori, he 
added that of natural hiftory, and antiqui- 
ties. He was, if not the fir ft, among the 
earlieft, who wrote on the antiquities of his 
country, on which he publiihed feveral 
learned works, to illuftrate, more efpecial- 
ly^ the hiftory oi Scotland during the time 
of the Romans. 

He publiftaed,^* Scotia illustrata; 
Jhcy Prodrojv^us HisTORiiE Natura-

plicanturJ" 1684, folio; and 1696, folio.* 

In this volume, which, he tells us, was . 
the work of twenty years, one part is ap- 
propriated to the indigenous plants of Scot-r 
land j it contains obfervations on the medi- 
cinal and oecpnomical ufes. A few rare 
fpecies make their firft appearance in this 
book, particularly that which Linnaeus 
named Sibbaldiay after the author ; and the 
Juigujlicum Scotkum.

the title " De Legibus Hijioria Naturalist'

Among the '* Mifcellanca quadam erudifce

had merit enough to entitle it to a repub^ 
lication, fo lately as in the year 1773. He 
meditated a Catohgia^ together with the 
hiftory of the other marine animals ofSco/^ 
hnd, in his fecond voluble of the ** Pr^- 
dromus:* 

In the year 1706, he communicated to 
the Rojral Society an accurate dcfcription, 
accompanied with a figure of the animal, 
and its fhell, named Ba/anus Ba/ena^ or

Pr. Hope, was the fon of My. Aljion^ of

Eddlewood'^y a gentleman of fmall efl:af» in 
the weft oiScQthndy and allied to the nolile 
fiunily off U(ti»iltan^ who, after having ftu- 
4iedi pbyfic, an4 travelled with feveral gen- 
tlemen, declined the practice of his profef-* 
fion, and retired to his patrimony. His fon 
Qhafks was ,born in the year 1683 ; and» at 
the time of his father's death, was at GhJ^ 
gpw^ applying with great aiSduity to hi^ 
ftudies. On this event, the Ducheis of Ha-% 
milton took him under her patronage^ and 
wished him to. have chofen the department 
of the hw; but his inclination for botanyt 
and the ftudy of phyfic, fupcrfeded all other 
fchemes ; and, from the year 171 6, he en- 
tirely devoted himfelf to phyfic. 
. At the age of thirty-three, he went over 
to Leyden^ to ftudy under Boerhaave,* 
where he remained near three years. At 
that pkce, be contrafted an intimacy with 
tyxt late celebrated Dr. Alexander Monro; 
and, with him, on their return to Edin-^ 
burgh, projefted the revival of medical lec- 
tures ^ where, but little had been done in 
that department, fince the firft eftablifli-

cairn. The plan yr^% modelled by that 
of L^yden. Monro was appointed to give 
kdtures in anatomy, and forgery; and Al- 
ston in botany, and the materia medica. 
Rutherford,; Sinclair, and PluMt 
MER, were fbon after appointed to fill up 
the other departments : and, to the fpirite4 
endeavours of thefe celebrated names, the 
univerfity of Edinburgh owes the rife of 
that reputation, which has lince fo defer- 
Vedly raifcd it to -be one of the firft fchools 
of phyfic in 'Europe. 

Dr. Alston continued to teach botany, 
and the materia medica, with unwearied afli- 
duity, until the time of his death, which 
took place Nov. 22, 1760, in the yytb 
year of his age. 

In 1740, Dr. Alston publiflied for the 
life of his pupils, ** Index Plant arum

In botany^ Dr. Alston's chief perform^ 
ance was, his '* Tirocinium Botanicum Edin-- 
burgenfe.'" 1753. 8* It contains a repub- 
lication of his *^ Index,'' firft printed in 
J 740 ; to which he now added the " Fun* 
damenta Botanica " of Ljnnjeus. But the 
bulk of the work is a profefled attempt to 
explode the fyflem of the Swede, and parti,- 
cjilarly tq invalidate all his arguments for the 
Jex of plants. This part of it was tranfla,^ 
ted by himfelf, and publifhed the next year 
in the firft volume of *' Eflaye and Obfer- 
** vations^ phyfical and literary.*' 8% Coul4 
the doftrin? of thtfexes pf plants hive been

Alston were fujfficient tq have efiedled his

years in the fyftems of Tournefort, 

Ray, and Boerhaave, to the firft of 

which he had even given improvement, k 

is not ftrange, that, at an advanced age. 

Dr. Alston rejedled a fyftem of fo much 

novelty, as that of Linn^us prefcnted. 

We do not willingly unlearn at fixty, 

what has been cherifhed from our earlieft 

youth. 

Dr. Alston's medical papers are, *^ A 

*' Diflcrtation on Tin as an Anthelmintic ;'*

PLUKENET* 

IT has been the fate of many learned 
men, who have deferved highly of the 
republic of letters, to have the private cir- 
cumftances, and occurrences of their lives, 
in a few years, fo far involved in obfcuri- 
ty, that almoft their immediate pofterity, 
howfoever defirous of gratifying a natural 
and laudable curiofity, and of rendering to 
their memory that tribute which their fer- 
viccs have demanded, have been almoft 
wholly fruftrated in their endeavours to ref- 
cue them from oblivion. 

If 



Piukenet* tq 

li 1 miftakc not, the truth of this pofi- 
tion is ftrongly exemplified, in the perfon^ 
of whom, in the order of time, I am next 
to fpeak. Of Dr* Leonard Plukenet, as 
far as I can find, there are fcarcely any me- 
morials, but what are to be collected from 
the prefaces of his works ; and they aflFord 
indeed very fcanty information. He has told 
us, that he was born in 1642 ; but whe- 
ther he was of Englijh origin, and of what 
family, docs not certainly appear; though it 
has been conjectured, that he was oi French 
extradlion. Where he received his fcho- 
laftic education, or at what place he took 
degrees in phyfic, I am not able to afcertain* 
Some light would be thrown on this cir- 
cumftance indeed, by determining, where 
his two friends, William Courten, Efq. 
and the Rev. Dr. Uvedale, of Enfield^ 
were educated ; fince he fpeaks of both 
thefe gentlemen, as having been his. fellow- 
pupils : probably it was at Cambridge ^ as 
he had a fon, named Richard^ purfuing his 
ftudics in that univerfity, at the publication 
oilns Almagejium, in 1696. Be that as it 
may, his writings fufficiently teftify his ex- 

C 2 tenfive 



20 C H A F t I! R 2?. 

tcnfivc knowledge of the learned languages* 
He dates the prefaces to his worksy from 
Old Palace Yard, Weftminfier \ where, from 
a circumftance mentioned in bis Phytogra^ 
fhiay it may be inferred, that he had a fmall 
garden, I know not that he ever attained 
to any confiderablc eminence as a pradtical 
phyfieian. The contrary may rather be 
prefumed, as I do not find his name in fc-. 
veral lifts of the College of Phyficians, 
printed in the iirft years of this century : 
neither in thofe of the Royal Society at the 
fame period. 

His ardour for his favodrite purfuit was 
remarkably ftrong ; Vt pene nullus^Jic ardeo^ 
was his motto. It does not appear, that he- 
ever had an opportunity of gratifying his tafte 
by travelling in fearch of pUnts. He feems 
to have devoted all his. leifure to his work: 
of iht Phytographta I fparing no pains to 
procure Specimens of rare,, and new plants. 
He had correfpondcBts:^ m all parts of the 
world > and had aceefs to the gardens of- 
the curious, in the environs oi London, and 
to that at Hampton Cotn-ty, vihich was in a 
flouriihing ftate, from the care which the 

k^g 



'Tluktnet. ii 

king and queen beftowed on It. The Earl 
of Portland alfo, had fo much relifli for 
exotics, as to have repeatedly fent Jacob 
Reej^e to the Weft Indies', to colled: cu- 
rious produdlions for th€ Royal Garden* 
Plukenet was one of thofe to whom Mr. 
Ray was indebted for afliftance in the ar- 
rangement of the fecond volume of his Hif- 
tory • and that eminent man, every where 
bears the ftrongeft teftimony to his merit. 
Neverthelefs Plukenet wanted that pa- 
tronage, to which his learning, and fcience, 
entitled him ; and he feems, by his com- 
plaints, to have feverely felt it. In the lat- 
ter part of his life, he appears to have been 
at variance with Sloane and Petiver; 
two of the firft charadlers of the age, for 
knowledge in his own ftudies. He ceri- 
fures their writings, it muft be confefled, 
in a flile of too much afpcrity. Whether 
this alienation from thofe of whom he had 
before fpoken in terms of friendship, and 
refpedt, had its .origin in jealoufy on the 
one hand, or what is more probable, on the 
other, in that indignant loftinefs, which 
tpo often accompanies the confcioufnefs of 
C 3 neglefted

negleded merit; or whether from other 
fources^ I cannot determine. It was how- 
ever probably unfavourable to Plukenet, 
fince Sloane was at that time rifing fall 
into reputation^ and influence. In the mean 
while^ no obflacles damped the zeal of 
Plukenetj he was himlelf at theexpence 
of his engravings, and printed the work at 
his own charge, until the publication of 
the laft part, his Amaltheum^ when he pro- 
cured a trifling fubfcription from a few of 
the nobility, amounting to about fifty-five 
guineas. Towards the clofe of his life, he 
is faid to have been aflifled by the queen, 
and to have obtained the fuperin tendency of 
the garden at Hampton Courts and was ho- 
noured' with the title of Royal Profeflbr of 
Botany. , 

I cannot difcovcr the exaift time of his 
deceafe; but it is probable he did not long 
furvive his lafl publication, in 1705. 

There is a copper- plate print of Dr. 
Plukenet, done in the 48th year of hisr 
age, prefixed to the Fhytographia -, with his 
arms, field ermine^ bearing a bend dexter 
engrailed gules«

Plukenbt had all that enthufiafm, 
without which, few attain pre-eminence ; 
and as the riches of Flora were daily pour- 
ing into Britairiy from all quarters of the 
globe, he failed not to avail himfclf of every 
x)pportunity of adding to his ftores. Indi- 
genous fubjefts were, equally with exotics, 
the objedts of this induftrious, and learned 
coUedor. Hence at length, his Herbarium 
confifted of eight thoufand plants; an afto- 
nifhipg number for a private, unopulent in- 
dividual to colled! Of thefc, the Pbytogra^ 
pbia is to be confidercd as the delineation of 
the new and rare kinds ; and the Almagef^ 
turn, Mantfjfa, and Amaltheum^ as the cata-t 
logue of the whole. 

The Fhytographia was publiflied at dif- 
ferent times- The firft part under the fol- 
lowing title :

Plukenet follows no fyftem ; the Ca-

Plukenet^s work contains upwards of 
2740 figures. Moil of them were engrjived 
from dried fpecimens, and many from fmall 
fprigs," deftitute of flowers,, or any parts of 
frudification, and confequently not to be 
afcertained : feveral of thefe, neverthelefs, as 
better fpecimens came to hand, are figured 
a fecond time, in the fubfequent plates. As 
he employed a variety of artifts, they arc 
very unequally done : thofe hy Vandtr Gucht 
have ufually the preference. The imperfec- 
tions of this work, however, are, in a great 
degree, thofe of the times ; yet it cannot Imt 
be regretted that Plukenet had it not ia- 
his power to have given his figures on a 
larger fcale. There are unqueftionably 
many varieties exhibited as real fpecies ; 
and one great defe<3: runs nearly through 
the whole work, that the new plants arc 
no further dcfcribcd, than by the fpecifical 
definitions, which, under the want of true 
generical charadters, were then infufficient«

LxNN-ffiujs, and others, mention a new 
edition of Plukenet's works in lyzo. 
But this was nothing more than the ufual 
artifice of the bookfellef; who, having 
purchafed the remaining copies, placed a 
new title-page. They were, however, re- 
printedy and divided into four volumes, in 
1769, with the addition of a few plates, 
that were wanting in fome copies of the 
fourth part of the Phytograpbia, Thofe 
who occafionally confult this author, will 
regret, that this opportunity had not been 
taken, of inferting the additions from the 
Mantijfa into the Almagefiumy by introdu* 
cing them in a fmaller chara6ter, and pla-^ 
cing the pages for both in the margin.

Dr. UvEDALE lived at Enfieldy where he 
cultivated a garden, which appears to have 
been rich in exotic produ<ftions. And al- 
though he is not known among thofe who 
advanced the indigenous botany of Britam, 
jet his merit as a botanift, or his patronage 
of the fcience at large, was confiderable 
enough to incline Petiver to apply his 
name to a new plant, which Miller re^- 
tained in his Didionary; but which has 
fince pafled into the genus Pofymma, of the 
Linriaan fyftem ; the author of which has 
neverthelefs retained Uvedalia, as the trivial 
epithet.

CONTEMPORARY with Plijkenet 
lived Mr. James Petiver, of whom 
too little intelligence is remaaning. 

It appears that he was apprenticed to 
Mr. Fekham^ apothecary to St. Bartholo- 
mew's HofpitaL He entered into bufinefs 
for himfelf in Aider/gate Street, where he 
lived the renuinder.of his days. He be- 
canie apothecary to the Charter Houfe^ and 
obtained a confiderable fhare of practice in 
his profeffion. 

He had an early propenfity to thefe ftudies, 
and,' excepting Mr. Court en, arid Df» 
Sloans, fcems to have been the only one, af-- 

XfiT

ter th© Tradescants, who made ally 
confidcrable colle<9ion in natural hiftoiy^ 
Petiver engaged the captains, and furgcons 
of fhips, to bring home fpecimens, and feeds 
of plants, birds, ftujfFed animals, and infedts i 
and he dlredted their choice, and enabled 
them to judge, in fome meafure, of proper 
objedls, by diftributing printed lifts and di- 
re<5tions among them. He was not lefs 
anxious to procure, what his native country 
afforded, and was fo fuccefsful in his efforts, 
that Sir Hans SloAne, who afterwards 
purchafcd it, offered Petiver four thou- 
Iknd pounds for his Mufeum, fome time be- 
fore his death: which offer, although it; 
may be confidered as a proof of the opu- 
lence of Sir Hans J is equally fo of the ex- 
tent of the colledion. 

The allurement of fuch uncommon cu- 
riofities as Mr. Petiver exhibited, foon 
obtained him confidcrable diftin^ion, and 
his name became well known, both at home 
and abroad. He was elefted into xh^ Royal 
^^.^A^/y^x ^rid as his particular attachment 
wM to plants, he became early the corre-

lume of his ^* Hiftory oi Plants ;*' and elfe- 
where owns his high obligations to him^ 
for the extent and freedom of his commu- 
nications. 

In the year 1 692, preparatory to the pub- 
lication of his iirft work, Petiver took it 
tour into the midland counties of England. 
I recoiled, on this occafion, the pleafure I 
had in my youth, in feeing the Lichen ju-^ 
batus growing on the fpot, where, I believe^ 
he firft difcovered it, on the higheft rocks 
in Charley Foreji, Leicejierjhire. , 

Mr. Petiver's iirft publication was,

and fynonyms of various rare animals, fof-

rious articles, the produce of England^ are 
here firft exhibited; particularly fome of 
the Cryptog<imous clafs, in the inveftigation 
of which he was very fuccefsful.

Among the provincial lifts of plants, 
printed in Bifhop GiBsoi^'s edition of 
Camden in 1695, Mr. Petiver com- 
municated the Middle/ex plants. All the 
others were drawn up by Mr. Ray, as was 
obferved under his article. 

Next to the Gazophylacium in the order 
of time, although not a diftind: work, was 
publifhed, in Mr. Ray*s third volume of

Mr. Petiver negbdied no opportuni- 
ties of augmenting the Englijh Flora. He 
,was the firft difcoverer of many Bnglifi^ 
plants, as well as of other natural produc- 
tions, fome of which he figured in the Ga^ 
zopbylaciumi but he meditated, and in part 
executed, (a work that had not been -at-

tempted before) a fet of diflm<3: figures of 
Britijh plants. Unfortunately he lived not 
to iiniih it. 

This work, which diilingui/hes Peti- 
VER as an auxiliary to Englijh botany, bears 
the title of *^ A Catalogue of Mr. Ray's 
** Englijh Herbaly illuftrated with Figures.'* 
fol. 171 3. t. 50 ; and continued " with the 
*' four- leaved flowers/' t. 5 1 — 72. fol. 1715. 
Twelve plants are engraved on each plate. 
The work ends with the feventeenth clafs. 
The figures are little more than outlines, but 
they are neat; and though they have the 
defedt of the old herbals, in being all on a 
iimilar fcale, were valuable, and efpecially 
as pointing out many of the varieties in the 
Synopfs of Ray, particularly among the 
Apetalotis and Syngenejious tribes. A new 
impreffion of thefc* plates was made under 
die infpedtion of Sir Hans Sloane, in 
1732, 

Thefe were the moft material works of 
Petiver. His fmaller publications a- 
mount to a great number, and are of lefs 
importance at this day, as being principally 
(hort catalogues and fingle tables of rare

Mr. Petiver was among the firft who 
purfued the idea that the virtues of plants 
might be determined, in general, by their 
agreements in natural charaders and clafles. 
I fay purfued, becaufe the idea had been 
fuggefted long before. Even C-«salpi- 
Kus, the inventor of fyftem, hints that the 
virtues of plants are pointed out by. their 
ftrudture, and alliance to each other. Thefe 
are his words: Tandem et facultates, quas 
medici maxime queer unt^ tanquam proprietates 
innotefcunt ex naturarum cognitione: qua enim

formation, and excite a curiofity to purfue 
with zeal, one of the chief ends of the in- 
ftitution.

In N"" 313, Mr. Petiver communica-* 
ted to the Royal Society the maijncr of ma- 
king' the Sty rax liquida^ which, he fays, is 
from the bark of the jR^ mallas (the cbarac^ 
ter of which is unknown) which grows on 
the ifland Cobrofs^ in the Red Sea. If this 
be the origin of the true, or oriental kind, 
there is likewife a Styrax liquida^ from the 
Liquidambar tree of Virginia. What is ge- 
nerally met with now, is juftly fufpedted to 
be a mixed artificial compofition. 

In N'* 232, Mr.PETivER publiflied, un- 
der the title of Botanicum hortenfe^ an Ac- 
count of divers rare plants, obferved in feve- 
ral curious gardens about London^ particu- 
larly in the Phyfic Garden at Chelfea. This 
was continued, in feven feparate tradls, to 
W 346. Vol. XXVII. XXVIIL XXIX. 

Mr. Petiver died at his houfe in Al^ 
derfgate Street ^ on the 20th of April, ;7i8. 
His body was carried to Cooke Hall^ where, 
agreeably .to the cuftom of the time, it lay 
in ftate. The pall was fupported by Sir 
Hans Slqane, Dr. L:evit, phyfician to 
the Charter Houfe, and four other phy- 
ficians. He left five guineas to Dr. Brady ^ 

for 



Petiver. 43 

for preaching his funeral fermon, and fifty 
pounds to the charity fchool of St.. Anns^ 
Aider/gate^. 

' Many of Petiver's fmaller pieces hav- 
ing become very fcarce, his works, exclu- 
five of his papers in the ** Philofophical

in 1764, in two volumes in folio, and one 
in octavo ; with the addition of fome plates,

PERSONAL NAMES OP GENERA. 

PETivER and Plukenet, as far as I 
can find, were the dvdEngliJh writers, 
who followed the example of Plumier in 
giving perfonal names to new genera. Fe- 
tiver IS, however^ fevcrely reprehended by 
LiNN^us, for having conferred this ho- 
nour on fonae who did not merit it : Hq 
obferves juftly, that it is due to fuch alone, 
as have fignalized thernfelves in the fcience. 
I take this opportunity to remark the rife 

and 



Perfonal Names, &c. 45 

and progrefs of this cuftom, which appears 
-to be of high antiquity, fince there are ex- 
amples of it among the antient poets, hifto- 
rians, and phyficians. 

Poetry has confecrated, in this way, the 
names oi Adonis, Daphne, Hyactnthus, Nar^ 
cijjus, and others. Pliny informs us, that 
Eupatorium is faid to be the cognomen of 
MiTHRTDATES, who firft difcovercd the 
ufes of that plant. Gentiana, we are told, 
is derived from Gentius, king oi Illyria: 
Lyjimachia, from Lysimachus, king of 
Sicily: TCelephium, from Telephus, king 
oiMyJia: Teucrium, from Teucer, king of 
Troy : Clymenum, from Clymenus : Arte-' 
mijia, from the wife of king Mausolus : 
Helenium, from Helena, the wife of A&- 
nelaus: Eupbcrbium, from Euphorbus, 
phyfician to Juba II. king of Mauritaniay 
though Salmasius avers, that this name 
had been in ufe at a much earlier period. 
Many other inftances might be adduced. 

In fucceeding ages, the devotion of the 
monks led them to confecrate a variety 
of plants to the faints* of the kalendar. 
Thus we have the Herba San^i An to-

Baixhine wrote a treatife, in 1591, now 
become very fcarce, ** De Plantis a Divrs

The rcftorers of botany, in a few in- 
flances, revived the praftice. Gesner, had 
he lived to finifh his plan in his ** Hiftory 
••• of Plants," intended to have perpetuated 
the names of his friends, by monuments of 
this kind. It appears, that he h^d requefted 
GuiLANDiNus, ^ohn Bauhine, Kent- 
man, Camerarius, and our celebrated 
countryman Dr. Caius, to feledl from his 
new fpecies, fuch as they chofe to bear their 
names, or allow to him the privilege of 
jadopting what he thought moft congru- 
ous. By the fame kind of tribute we learn, 
from his -letters, that he propofed to record 
the names of his friends Gassei(us, Occo, 
Aretius, and feveral others. 

Matthiolus, however, adually re- 
ftored the ufage, by the application of the 
terrn Cortufa to a new plant, in honour of 

CORTUSUS, 



Terjhnal Namesi 47 

CoRTUsus, the fucceffor of Guilandi- 
Ktrs, in the garden of Padua ; and Clu- 
sius followed his example, by calling the 
Contrayervd of the (hops Drakcena^ in ho- 
nour of Sir Francis Drake ; from .which 
time it was fparingly pradtifed, until after 
the invention of fyftem ; and the conftriic- 
tion of generical charafters, at the latter 
end of the laft century. Tournefort, 
PLUMiER^and Petiver, led the way, and 
have been followed by all fucceeding writers 
of note, and by none more than by Lin- 
naeus himfelf. It may be ftiled the apo-^ 
theofis of hotzni^s } and Linnaeus maybe 
compared to the high prieft, who has thus 
immortalized a numerous group of cele- 
brated men. 

The practice, however, was fevercly ceil- 
fured by fome of the older botanifts, who 
objedted; that thefe names, having no con- 
nection with the form, nature; habit, or 
properties of the plant, conveyed no idea 
of diftindion. But the objection, if duly 
weighed, is of no force ; fince there is not, 
perhaps, a fihgle appellation, even among 
the beft, of Greek etymology, however aptly 
4 framed. 



48 C H A P T E R 30' 

framed, which cdnveys any charafter of thfc 
genus, that might not with equal propriety 
have been applied to f multitude of others* 
The free ufe that Plumier made of this 
privilege, in honouring fo great a number 
of Englilhmeo, does equal credit to his own 
difcernment, and impartiality, and to the 
merit of thofe on whom he bellowed this 
laurel. On this account, I hope it may 
not be ungrateful to the reader, to digrefs 
fo far, as to introduce a fliort notice of this 
liberal-minded foreigner* 

PLUMIER. 

Charles Plumier was born at Marfeilles, 
in the year 1646 ; and, after a claffical edu- 
cation, devoted himfelf to a religious life j 
and, at the age of fixteen, entered into the 
order of the Minifne Friars. Being early 
inclined to mechanics and philofophy, he 
iludied mathematics, at Touloufe, under 
Pere Matgnan, a celebrated profelTor of the 
fcience, and of the fame order. In fome 
of his leifure hours, he amufed himfelf in 
the pradice of Turning, having been taught 
.the art by his father 5 and became fo great 

a proficient. 



Plumief. 49 

t projficlent, that he wrote a book on the 
fubjed:. Under Pere Maignan, he alfo 
learned to make lenfes, mirrors, micro-^ 
fcopes, and other inftruments of philofo- 
phy ; and early acquired the arts of defign- 
ing and painting. He was foon after fent 
by his fuperiors to Rome^ where his clofe 
application to hiis ftudies, and to thefe arts, 
together with optics and mathematics, de- 
ranged his ^health. In this fituation, he 
fought for relaxation in the ftudy of botany; 
under the leftures of P/r^ Serge Ant, in 
a convent at Romej and in the inftrudtions 
oi Francis de Onuphriis, an Italian phy- 
fician, and oi Syhius Boccone, a Sicilian. 
By thefe connieaidns, he was infenfibly led 
to devote himfelf to his new ftudy. Being 
recalled by his order into Provence^ he was 
placed in a convent near Hyeres^ and ob- 
tained leave of his fuperiors to fearch the 
coafts of that country, and the neighbour- 
ing Alps, for plants. At this time, he con- 
ceived a defign of forming a new Pinax^ or 
*^ General Hiftory of Vegetables," for which 
he had made many drawings, and colledted 
materials; but his fubfequent deftination 
Vol. Hi E prevented 



n 



50 CHAPTER 39* 

prevented his making an eSeftual progre^ 
in this defign. He icon after became ac- 
quainted with TouRNEFORT, then on hig 
botanical tour in the South i£ France ; and» 
together with GARii>ELy profeiTor of bo-* 
tany at Aix^ accompanied dial eminent maa 
in his refearches. 

Thiis qualified^ and white he was herbO'*

expedition, by the fuccefs dl our great na- 
turalift, Sloane^ in Jamaica^ Pi^umier 
acquitted hiaiielf fo well^ that he was twice 
jfent afterwards,, at the King's expence, te 
compleat the natural hiftory o( the Antilles ;. 
and was rewarded with the tide of BManift 
to the King, and an increa&d penfion each 
time. He paiSed two years in thofe iflands, 
and on the neighbouring continent; but 
made Domingo his principal refidenee* He 
made dcfigns and paintings of many hundred 
plants, on a fcale as large as the life -, be- 
fides numerous figures- of birds^ fiflies^ and 
infeds.

On his return from his fccoiid voyage, 
. t>y the irrtcreft of M. PoNTCHARTRAiNi 
he procured the firft fpecimen of his labours 
to be publifhed at the Louvre^ under the 
title of " IXefcription des Plantes de VAme-^ 
rique.'* 'F<A. 1695. pp, 94. tab. 168. The 
firft fifty of thefe tables reprefent Ferns ; the 
remainder, divers fpecies of the Arum genus ; 
the PipeTi Pdjjiflorce^ Rajania, DolkhoSi and 
Various others. The figures confift of little 
more than outlines ^ but biding a^ large as 
the life> and drawn with great accuracy and 
freedom, they have a very fine effeiS:* Th^ 
defcriptions are in French. 

On his return from the third Voyage, he 
fettled at Parisy in the chafaiSer of his or- 
der; and^ in 1703, piibljfhed his ^* Nova 
Plantarum General 4**. In this work^ ^ 
which isciJnftruaedonthe planofToURNE-

thor defcribes, and figures^ the charaders of 
2 06 new genera ; among which are many 
of the plants ufed in medicine* It is in 
this book he pays the tribute, fo often fpe- 
cified, not only to the manes of deceafed 
botanifts> but to feveral eminent men then 

E 2 living : 



52 CHAPTER 30. 

living : he has, in this way, given appelIa-» 
tions to more than fifty genera^ taken from 
the names of botanifts. 

In the courfe of thcfe pages, thofe gene- 
rical terms^ which have been formed from 
the names of EngUJh botanifts of renown, 
thus celebrated by Father Plumier, are 
mentioned under their refpe<aive articles ; 
but I here colledt them into one view : 
Gerardia. Plukenetia. 

Lobelia* Rajania^ 

Morifonia. Sloanea* 

Parkinfonia. Turnera. 

Petiveria. 
In the year 1704, he was prevailed on by 
M. Fagon, to undertake a voyage to Perui 
to difcover and delineate the Peruvian Bark 
tree. Nothing but the greateft zeal for 
fcicnce, could induce a man at the age of 
fifty-eight, to attempt fo perilous a voyage^ 
While he was waiting for the fhip, to em- 
bark with a new viceroy at Port Sti Mary^ 
near Cadiz, he was feized with a pleurify, 
and died. 

Having, before his departure from Paris, 

prepared for the prefs his ^* Trait^ des Fou-^

in 1705 ; pp. 146, tab, 172. The text in

in the former volume enter again into this ; 
and, as this likewife was printed at the 
King's expencc, it has all the advantages in 
the execution, that accompanies royal rau- 
nificence* 

We are informed by Dr. Lister, that 
Plumier left behind him ^r^wings of 
plants, fufficient to make ten volumes, equal 
to the firft book above mentioned. They 
are faid-to have amounted to 1400. Some 
of thefe remained in the convent at Paris^ 
to which Plumier belonged : others were 
in the King's library. From the latter, 
Boerhaave procured copies of 508 fpe- 
cies, done by Aubriet, under the infpcc- 
tion of Vail LAN T. Thefe were publifhed 
in 1755 — 1760, by Profeflbr Burman, at 
Amjierdam^ in ten fafciculty accompanied 
with 262 plates, on which are engraven 
upwards of 400 fpecies : and Dr. Bloch, 
oi Berlin J has procured many of the fi(hes 
for his late fplendid work on ichthyology.

and concerning which his own teftimony 
had been controverted. In the fame work

The world was deprived of much of the 
fruit of his labours, by his untimely death. 
Banister increafed the lift of martyrs to 
natural hiftory. In one of his excurfions, 
in purfuit of his objeft, he fell from the 
rocks, and perifhed. His Herbarium came 
into the pofleffion of Sir Hans Sloane, 
who thought it a confiderable acquifition.

VERNON AND KREIG. 

About the fame time with Banister, 
as I conjedure, Mr. William Vernon, fel- 
low of St. Peter's College, Cambridge^ and 
Dr. David Kreig, a German phyfician, 
led by their genius for botany, made a 
voyage to Maryland. They returned, after 
having coUefted an Herbarium of feveral 
Jiundred new and un^efcribed plants. Thcfe 
came into the poffeffion of Sir Hans 
Sloane, by whofe liberal communication 
they were inferted in the *^ Supplement '' 
to Ray's Hiftory. Mr, Vernqn is alfo 
fpoken of by Ray, as nof lefs fkilful and 
^fliduous in the purfuit: of Englijh plants, 

* Mr. Houston confecrated to Banister a genus 
oi Decandrous climbing plants, which Sloane, Pluke-

^nd of all other branches of natural know- 
ledge. His difcoverics in the Cryptogamia 
clafe .were numerous. 

Of Dr. Kreig» I can give no further 
account than that he was of Saxony. I con-^ 
jcfture, that after his return from Mary- 
land, he retired into his native country. He 
was the friend and correfpondent of Dale, 
who, in his Pharmacologia, introduces his* 
name in the moft refpedful manner, for 
notices communicated by him ; and ranks 
him among the few eminent men of the time, 
who excelled in the knowledge of the Ma- 
teria Medica and Chemiftry. Dr. Kreiq 
was not living when Dale publiftied the 
third edition of the above-mentioned work, 
in 1737. 

Dr. Kreig communicated to the Royal 
Society, ** An Account of Cobalt and the 
•* Preparation of Smalt and Arfenic," ac- 
cording to the procefs ufed at the mines of 
Shneeberghy in Hermanduria. It was printed

CUNNINGHAM. 

In the period we are now fpeaking of, 
J)ut few voyagers poflefled any confiderable 
jknowledge of nature ; or a fpirit of en- 
quiry, powerful enough to induce them to 
facrifice their avocations, from interefted 
purfuits, to the ftudy of natural hiftory, 
Sloane, Banister, and a few^ others, 
were indeed exceptions; and, in this fketch, 
it would, be injurious to his memory, not 
to add the name oi James Cunningham, 
to whom Ray, and particularly Pluke- 
NET and Petiver, acknowledge important 
obligations, for his copious communica- 
|:ions of new plants, 

The merit qf Mr. Cunningham would 
juftly demand a more complete gratification 
pf curiofity concerning his life and circum- 
ilances, than I can fupply. I can only, 
colled, that he went out in 1698, as fur- 
geon to the factory, eftablifhcd by the Eaft 
India Company at Emuy^ or jimoy^ on the 
poaft. of China *^ and afterwards, made a

fccond voyage in the fame capacity, to thq 
fubfequent eftabliflimcnt at Kufan, or Chti-^ 
fan^ in 1700, on which ifland he refided 
fome time. 

I conjedure alfo, that he was afterwards 
fixed at Pulo Condore^ and was the perfon 
to whom we owe the account of the maf- 
facre of the Englijh, by the MacaJJarSj at 
that factory, in 1705, as related in the Mo- 
dern Part of the Univerfal Hijloryy vol. x^ 
p. 154; edit. 1759. %\ 

Mr.CuNNiNGHAM kept a journal of the 
weather in both his voyages to China ; and 
during his refidence on the ifle of Chufan, 
he appears to have been very adlive in coU 
leding the producSioos of that place. He. 
fent over to Plukenet and Petiver a 
very large number of new plants, as is evi- 
dent from an infpedtion of their writings • 
In the " Amaltheum' of Plukenet, his 
name occurs in almoft every page. 

From the ifland oi Afcenfioriy Mr. Cun- 
ningham tranfmitted to Petiver an ac- 
count of the plants, and fhells, he obferved 
there. He fent a journal of his voyage,

BROWN. 

Befides Mr. Cunningham, there were 
two ingenious fargcons of the name of 
Brown, refident in the Eaji Ivdies; contem-* 
porary with Plukeni^t, and Petiver, 
*to whom tbefe writers were under fingulaf 
obligations, for the liberality and import- 
ance of their communications, both of ve-i 
getablc and animal productions, from thd 
Eqft Indies^ 

Mr. Samuel Brown was furgeon to the 
Fort at St. George^ now called Madras* 
His correfpondence with Mr. Pe titer, 
and his colledions, have been noticed be-

Among the contemporaries of Mr. Rat, 
I am led, Sxoax private information, to men- 
tion Andrew Glen, M. A. a divine, who, 
although his name docs not occur in the 
writings of his time, was the friend and ac- 
quaintance of that eminent man ; having 
probably acquired a tafte for fimilar purfuits, 
from a frequent intercourfe with him, at 
the feat of his illuftrious friend, Mr. Wil- 
LUGHBY, near Nottingham. I have kzn 
an Herbarium, colledtcd by Mr. Glen> 
which bears date in 1685, containing up- 
.warda of feven hundred indigenous, and 
two hundred exotic plants. Some of thefe 

* Dr. Plukenet denominated a new genus ol African 
plants belonging to the Pentandrous chfs^Eriocephalos Bru^ 
niadesj in honour of Alexander Brown. Linn^us has 
perpetuated the genus -, but, agreeably to his rules, which 
do not admit of fuch terminations, has changed the term 
to Brunia, of which fome fpecics are known in the Eng^

He afterwards travelled into Sweden and

he began another colledion, which is dated 
1692; but contained not more than two 
hundred fpecimens. This Herbarium^ all 
circumftances confidered, was not mean 
for the time in which it was made. Mr. 
Glen was afterwards redor oi Hathernei 
in Leicejlerjhirey where he died at an ad-s

thofe great works in exotic botany^ whidt 
have immortalized their names. This pe-

which, as it has been called by the elegant 
and learned author of the " Eflay on the Ge- 
" nius and Writings of Pope/' " the Go!- 
** den Age of Learning in England^*' fo hag 
LiNNAUS named it, in his Allegorical Hif- 
tdry of the Rife and Progrefs of this Sci- 
ence, " The Golden Age of Botany/' 
and Sloan £ was one of its brighteii orna- 
mcnts. 

Of the life of this great patron of natural 
fcience, it would be fuperfluous in me ta 
attempt a detailed account ; fince this tri- 
bute has been paid to his memory in the 
*^ JEloge of the French Academy," in the 
**]^iograpbiaBritanntca^'* the '* Biographical 
** Didionary," and other colled:ions of that 
kind, in daily ufe. ' Hence, I ftall, from 
thele publications, extract only the outlines 
of his life, as they are connected with,^ and 
tend to eluddate, his general charadler, his 
acquirements in natural hiflory, and his bo- 
tanical publications. : _ 

Sir tians SloAne was defcended from . 

parents. 



parents, driginally of Scottijh extraftion, and 
was born at Killileagb^ in the county of 
Down, in Ireland, April i6, 1660. His 
younger years were marked by a ftrong at- 
tachment to the works of nature. At fix- 
tccn, his ftudies were interrupted by ill 
health, in confequence of a fpitting of blood, 
Vrhich. confined him for three years. On 
his amendment, he fiudied the preliminary 
brahches of phyfic in London^ for four 
years ; chemiftry^ under a pupil of the great 
Stahl; his favourite fcience, ^tChelfed 
G;acrden, then but juft eftablifhed j and, 
ybung.as he was, contra<Sed during that\^ 
t^^ne, an acquaintance with Boyle and 
RaY^ Mr. Sloane afterwards, in com- 
pany With Mr. Tancred Robinson, and 
another Audent, vifited France for improve- ^ 
ment. At Paris, he attended Tourne- 
. FORT and Du Verney j and is fuppofed to • 
have taken his degrees in medicine at Mont^ 
pelier % fome fay, at Orange. He returned 
to London at the latter end of the year 1684, 
and became the favourite of Dr. Syden- , 
ham, who took him into his houfe, and zea- ^ 
l6ufly promoted his interell. In November 

F 2 1684, 



#ft C H A P T E R 32. 

1684, he was ekfted a fellow of the Royal 
Society I and, in April 1687, entcfcd into 
the college of phyflcians, Thcfe early ad^ 
vancementa in the pro&fibnal line, are tho 
ilrongeil prefiuDption& in favour of lus fii« 
perior knowledge, and promifing abilicies. 
Vet thefe flattering profpedts He relih^ 
^ui^ed, to gratify his ardour for natural 
Icnowledge. 

Qn the ;2th of September 1687, and ia 
the 28th year of his age, he emharkod fer 
Jamakay as phyiician to the Duke of jSbi- 
n/ark y and touched at Madeira^ Bariadoes^^ > 
Nevis^ and S/. Kitt's. The Duke dyiag on 
the 19th of December, foon after their ar- 
rival at Jamaka^ Dr* Sloane's flay on thft 
ifland did not exceed fifteen months. Dur- 
ing this time» howev^, fuch was his appli- 
cation, that, in the language of his French 
eulogift, had he not converted, as it were, 
his minutes into hours, he could not have 
made thofe numerous acquifitions, which 
contributed fo largely to extend the know- 
ledge of nature ; while they laid the founda* 
tion of his own future fame and fortune. 

Here lam led to ohferve^ that feveral 

circumftances 



<:ircumftance8 condurred tttytdtvXg the toy- 
age of Dn SloaJ^e to Jafnaica^ which 
rendered it peculidfly fuctefsful to natui-al 
hiftoiy . He Was the firft man of learnings 
whom the love of fcidnce alone had led from 
Engiandy to that ditlant part c^ the globe; 
and^ confequently, the field was wholly open 
to him. He was alfeady well acquainted 
with the difcoveries of the age. He had an 
cnthafiistfm for his obje<3:, and Was at an age, 
when both adJivity of body, and vivicity 
of mind, cohcu^ to Yanquifh difficulties. 
Undar. this happy cdncidence of circum* 
ilances, it is not ilrange that Dn Sloanb 
returned faome with a rich harveft^ In faft, 
hefides a proportional number of fubjeds 
from the animal kingdom, he brought firdni 
yamaicay and the other iflands they touched 
at, not fewer than 800 different fpecies of 
plants. A number, very far beyond what 
had been imported, by any individual into 
England before. 

Dr. Sloane returned from his voyage 
on the 29th of May 1689; and, fixing in 
London^ foon became eminent. He was 
chofen phyfician to Chrift's Hofpital, in 

F 3 1694. 



,yO CHAPTER 3a. 

.i694r In the preceding year, he had hce^ 
elected fecretary to the Royal Society, and 
had revived the publicatioji of the Pbilofor 
pbkal TranfaBionSy which had bcea interr 
rupted from the year 1687. This office he 
held till 1712, and was tl^en fucceedpd by 
Dr. Hallev. 

In 1695, Dr, Sloane inarried EBzabetb^ 
daughter of Alderman Langley, of London. 
.^hp 4i^ in 1724. She brought hims be-* 
iides a fon, apd daughter, who died young, 
two other daughters, wljo furvivcd, and 
were advantageoufly married ; the eldeft to 
George Stanley, Efq; of the coMXity oi Hants y 
and the younger to Lord Cadogan* 

It was about this time that he became 
an iadtivc membqr of the college, in pro- 
mpting the plan of 1^ difpenfary for the 
poprj; which wa$ at l^gth carried into 
cfFeft. The fpuds excitod on this occafioa 
gave rife tp the cclebr^cd fatirc from Dr^ 
Garth. 

It was not till the year 1696 that Dn

This volume, in triiifically valuable as it 
is, may yet be confidered as only the no- 
menclature, or fjrftematic index to his fub- 
fcquent vrovk. The arrangement of the 
fobje<a (and which was ftriftly followed in 
^^TheHiftory,") is nearly that of Mn Rayi 
vegetables being thrown into twenty-five 
large natural clafles, or families. Among 
botanifts of that time, generical charadlers 
had not attained any remarkable precifion ; 
and Sloane, like Plukenet, was little 
farther anxious, than to refer his new plants 
to fome genus already cftablifhcd, without 
a minute attention to the parts of fruftifi- 
cation, farther than as they formed part of 
the charafter' drawn from habit: vet with

Before I difmifs this volume, I mufl: 
mention an inftance of the liberality of its 
lauthor, in allowing Mr^ Ray the free uic 
of his manufcripts of the Jamaica plants, 
on the publication of the third volume of 
his *' Hiftory,*' in 1704. Accordingly, wc 
)Bnd all Sloan £*s new plants, with the de^ 
fcriptipns at large, inferted in that work* 
He al/b communicated a lift of Englijh

the fecond edition of the Synopjis^ and con-- 
tiiiucd by Dillenius in the third. 

Dr. Sloan E began early to forni a mu- 
fcum, and it was, by the colledtions made 
in his voyage, become confiderable ; but the 
«ra of its celebrity was not till 1702, when 
it received the augmentation of Mr. Cour- 
ten's valuable ftores- United by fimilar 
tafle. Dr. Sloan E had formed, with this 
gentleman, an early and ftrift friendfliip; 
and a perpetual interchange of communi- 
cations, and good offices, had fubfifted be- 
tween them y of which ^wHans himfelf bears 
public teflimony in his writings. It is not 
pojflible, at this time, to afcertain the ex- 
tent of Mr. Court en's colled:ion j but it 
isfufficiently certain that it was very ample : 
the acquifition of it added new ardour and 
diligence to our naturalift, in the augment- 
ation of it/. He has himfelf exhibited a ge- 
neral ftatement of the contents of hi$ mu- 
feurn, twenty-two years after its enlarge- 
ment by the above-mentioned colle(5tion. 
By this it appears, that the fubjedts of na- 
tural hiftory alone, exclufive of two hundred 
volumes qf preferved plants,, aploupted tQ 

more

inoFC than 26,200 articles. They were af-r 
terwards augmented to upwards of 30,600 1 
as may be feen by ** A General View of the 
Contents,*' publifhed a year before his death. 
—And here I cannot but obferve, that the 
curious arc under lingular obligation to the 
author of the article Courten, in the fourth 
yolilme of th^ new edition of the Biagra^ 
fhia Britannica^ who has, with great labour, 
-brought to light fo many interefting me- 
moirs relating to Mr, Courten, and his 
femily. His truly laborious refearches have 
done equal Juf^ce to that gentleman, and to 
Sir Hans Sloane, by refcuing the hiftoiy 
of their connexion from great mifreprefent- 
ation. Hence we learn, that Dr. Sloane, 
as executor to his friend, fo. far from ac- 
quiring the acceiSoH of Mn Cour ten's 
mufeum at a dear rate^ as had been repre- 
ientcd in the preceding edition, obtained it 
at a price greatly under jts origiqal, and real 
yalue.

'i^hc intfoduftion contains^ 1^4 pages, tbidt 
b replete With matter of an interefting na- 
ture,, and evidently difplays the great paks 
the author^ took to eo}le<3: materials lor lht$ 
work. It comprehends a general account 
of the difcovery of the Weji Indies^ and of 
the idziidof Jamaica ia particular: the geo-/ 
graphy, the climate, etnd foil ; food, man- 
ners, and economy of the various inhabi- 
tants: defcription of a tour the author made 
to various parts of the country, and efpcci- 
ally to the riiins ofSeviffa, with an account: 
of the church built by Peter Martyr: a lift 
of mpre than fifty Europeaa vegetables, 
principally of the culinary tribe, cultivated 
in the gardens of Jamaica. He concludes 
with an hiftory of the difeaies, and the de- 
tail of many cafes which caxne under hii'

own obienraticm. Then follows the }(mt» 
nal of the voyage ; with ample defcriptions 
of the marine animals obierved in the couHe 
of it : the plants obierved at Madeira, {cvt-^ 
ral of which are figured in the work it&If : 
obiervations of the like kind made at Bar^ 
badoes. The remainder of the volume con-» 
tains a methodical arrangement, and de« 
icription, of all the fubmarine, and herba-^ 
ceous plants, natives of the ifland; amount-- 
ing to 550 and upwards. Very few fyno- 
nyms are here introduced 1 but references, 
in general, made to the copious colle<ftion 
of them in his " Catalogue/* To each 
plant the author has fubjoined, from medi- 
cal authors^ and from travellers, the moft 
ample account of their fevcral ufes. 

Tht fecond volume was not publiflied till 
the year 1725, and was dedicated to the 
king. The reafons of this tielay are afligned . 
in the introdudtion, and were, principally, 
the care, the arrangement, and defcriptioh 
of his mufeum. The acceffion of Mr. 
CouRTEN*s colledion has been remarked 
above 5 and that of Petiver, in 1718, 
gave Sir Ifans much employment. Peti- 
ver 



Sloane. Jt^^ 

.VER had amafled a greater quantity of the 
produftions of nature, than any man be- 
fore him : but he had not prefcrved them 
with a care equal to the zeal with which he 
acquired them ; and it demanded extraordi- 
nary diligence to recover them from the in- 
jury they had fuftained. It is in the intro- 
dudlion to this volume that Sir Hans gives 
agencr?Ll inventory of his Library, and Mu- 
feum, \s it ftood in the year 1725, which 
has beeh noticed before ; and, by the com- 
parifon of which with later eftimates, it^p- . 
pears how greatly he increafed it after that 
time. . 

This fecond volume comprehends fivc^- 
hundred pages, and completes the vegetable 
part, and the animal kingdom. The new 
plants are nearly all figured. The plates 
are continued to the number of 274. The 
laft forty belong to the animals, of which, 
fome of all the clafles, the Mammalia ex- 
cepted, are here exhibited. 

To the curious botanift, it will be ob- 
fervable, that out of 800 vegetables, de- 
fcribed in thefe ^volumes, above 100 arc 
Ferns ; and that of the others, more than 
350 Ipecies are of xkit arborefcent kind. 

Subfcquent

Subfequcnt voyagers have eftabliflied it as H 
fa<ft, that in the warmer and intertropical 
regions, this latter clafs conftitutes, in a 
general way, the third part pf the vegetable 
produftions of nature. Abundantly the re- 
verie of this takes place in temperate and 
cold climates. 

In thcfe volumes Sir Hans' has intt^oduced 
all his quotations at length from the books 
of travels mentioned in the ^' Catalogue,'* 
to illuftrate the various ufes of each vege- 
table. They exhibit a proof of the author^s 
induftry, which, I conceive, it is difficult to 
parallel in any other work. The tables, 
jurhich were principally engraved by Vander 
Guchty although on a large fcale, yet hav- 
ing the difadvantage of being done from 
dried fpecimens, want thofe natural atti- 
tudes which grace nxore modern perfonn-. 
ances. In this volume'. Sir Hans takes va- 
rious occafions to defend himfelf from the 
ilridhires of Plukenet ; and, in his turn, 
cdticiies that author, though in a language 
much Icfs cenfurable than that of the Man^ 
ttffd.

and on the continent. Sir Arthur Raw-

fent James Haklcw^ a fkilful gardener, 
to Jamaica, who returned with a (hip al- 
moft laden with plants, in. a vegetating 
Aate; and with a great number of dried fpe- 
cimen$. Of the latter, Sloans had all 
fuch as were new, before he publiflied his 
jfirft volume. Many of the living plants 
fucceeded in the garden of ^iv Arthur , at 
Moyra, in Ireland ; and many were diftri- 
buted into the garden of the Bifliop of Lon^

ter bears date in 1684 ; and Der ham's col- 
ledtion contains thirteen. Moft of them have 
.reference to botanical fubjedis, while they 
. evidence the mutual frkhd/hip of the wri-* 
ters ; a cirumftance indeed very pathetically 
c^cpreffcd by Mr. Ray, ih the kft letter he 
evbr wrote; which was but a few days be- 
fore his death, being dated Jan. 7, 1704. 

In 17089 he was eledted a foreign mem- 
ber of the Roya/ Academy of Sciences at Pa^ 
ris ^ a didindtion of the higheft eftimatiota 
in fcience ; and the greater at that time, as 
the French nation was at vsrar with Eng^ 
landy and the queen's coiiicnt was neceflary 
to the acceptance of it. He was frequently 
confultcd by Queen -/fo;*, who, in her laft 
illnefs, was blooded by him. On the ac- 
ceflion of George I. he was created a baro« 
net; being the firft Englijh phyfician on 
whom an hereditary title of honour had 
been conferred. He was appointed Phyfi- 
cian General to the Army, which office h« 
enjoyed till 1727, when he was ttiade Phy- 
fician to King George II. He gained difc 
confidence of Queen Caroline^ and pre- 
scribed for the royal fiimily till his death.'

la 1719, Sir Hans was clfa9iBd Prefidcril 
of Ihq Cdlcge of Phyficiani, which ftaticMi 
he held fixteen yeais^ and during that tim^ 
he gave fighal proofs, of bis zeal £ir the m^^ 
terefts of that body. 

On purohafing the manor of Cbelfea^ he 
give the fee fimple of the "Botanical Garden, 
to the Company of Apothecaries, on condi- 
tions, which will more properly be ipeci* 
fied in a fubiequent part of this vrark. 

On the death of Sir Ifaac Nbwton, in 
1727, Sir-Efo/zxSLOANE was advanced to the 
prcfidency of the Royal Society of London^ 
the ihtereft of which no man had ever more 
uniformly promoted. He made the Society 
a prefent of 100 guineas, and a buft of the 
founder. King Cbarlts II. Thus, in. the 
xcnith of profpcrity, he prcfided, at the fame 
dme, over the two moft iiluftrious &ientific 
bodies in the kingdom : and, while he dif^ 
charged the refpttSkive duties of each ftation. 
With credit and honour, he alio enjoyed the 
.m^ft extenfive and dignified empbyment u 
a phyfidan. He occupied thefe important 
ftations from the year 17151 to 173.3, when 
he refigncd tfcie prefidency of the College 
of Phyficians ^ and, in 1740, at the/ge of

formcd/the tefplution of withdrawing from

In i74i» h&: removed his Library^ and 
Mufeum ; and, on the 12th of May, fixed 
at his new manfion, where, occafionally vi- 
fited by his friends, and by all men of dif- 
tindkion from abroad, he paffed in ferenity, 
and in the conftant exercife of benevolence; 
the laft twelve years of his life, which ter* 
minated Jan. 1 1, 1752, G» S, 

Sir Hans Sloans was tall, and weH 
made in his peribn ; eafy, polite, and en- 
gaging in his manners; fprightly in his 
converfation ; and obliging to all. To fo- 
reigners he was extremely courteous, and 
ready to fhew and explain his curiofities to 
all who gave him timely notice of their 
vifit« He kept an open table once a week 
for his learned friends, particularly thofe of 
the Royal Society. In the aggregation of 
his vail collection of books, he is faid to 
have fent his duplicates, either to the Royal 
College of Phyficians^ or to the Bodleian 
Library, i 
• He was governor of almoft ^v^ hofpi- 



tal in London ; and to each^ afker hsiving 
given an hundred, pounds in his life-time, 
he left a more cqnfiderable legacy at his 
death* He was ever a benefadlor to the 
poor, who felt the confequences of his death 
feyerely. He was zealous in promoting 
the eftabliihment of the colony of Georgia, 
in 1732 ; and formed^ himfelf, the pl^n for' 
bringing up the children in the Foundling 
Hofpital, in 1739. 

In the exercife of his function as a phy- 
fician, he is laid to have been remarkable 
for the certainty of his prognoftics ; and the 
hand of the anatomifl verified, in a fignal 
ipanner, the truth of his predidions, rdat-. 
ing to the feat of.difeafes. By his pradlice, 
he not only confirmed the efficacy of the 
Peruvian Bark in intermittents, but extend- 
ed its ufe in fevers of other denominations, 
in nervous diforders, and in gangrenes and 
hemorrhages. The fandtion he gave to in- 
oculation, by performing that operation on^ 
fome of the royal family, encouraged, and 
much accelerated its progrefe throfughput 
the kingdom^ His ointment for the Leu^

Poflcfled o^ affluence, entirely the tewani 
cf his own merit. Sir Hans Sloane en-* 
joyed, through a long life, every fatisfa<ftion 
that fiDiehce could beftow ; and, in the Bri^ 
tijb Mufeum^ has not ooly ercdcd the no-i 
bleft monument to his own fame, but z, 
temple alio to the culture of lean^ing antl 
of fcience, which will tranfmit his dona-, 
tion to future ages, as a fignal inftance of 
the munificeftcc of a private individual.

ROYAL SOCIETY. 

AMONG thofe public inftitutions, 
which in a lingular .manner invigo- 
rated, in this period, the fpirit of natural 
hiftory in 'Englanay the Royal Society 
oi London claims the moft diftinguiflied no- 
tice. In its defign, as in its progrefs, it •

natural knowledge. The colledion of a 
mufeum of natural curiofities, was one of 
the objefts in view; and fuch was the re- 
fpedlability of the fociety, both as a body, 
and in its individuals, that, through its 
means, the whole nation may be faid to 
have amply contributed to its emolument. 
All new objcfts of curiofity; all new books, 
at home and abroad ; new difcoveries 
throughout all nature, inceflantly offered 
themfelves ; and thus, not only tended to re- 
move the prejudices that too ftrongly pre- 
vailed againfl the fludies of nature in that 
ag^, but, in the event, excited a paflioa in 
the public, which was fo fuccefsfully exert- 
ed in improving, not natural hiiiory alone, 
but real and ufeful fcience at large, that it 
will not be confidered as an exaggerated 
encomium to aflert, that more effedtual 
advancement wa;s made by the influence 
of this illiiftrious body in one century, 
than had before taken place from the ear- 
lieft ages. Botany fhared thcfe benefits >

CJIELSEA GARDEN. 

I proceed fmther to obferve, that, among 
ihe ailiflaaces which the fcieoice has re^ 
reived from public bodies of men, muft be 
mentioned alfo thsJi which fy^uug from the 
Phyfic Garden, founded by the Company 
fii Apothecaries at Cbelfea 5 an i^^itution 
which refledted t^e higheft honour on that 
jefpeiSable fociety^ This jook place in the 
year 1 673^ although theinfcriptioA over the 
entrance imports, that the Garden was not 
(efe<aually conftriiMaed till fhe year 1 686.

each fummer, and make excurfions to in- 
veftigatc plants. The Itinera^ publifhed 
by Johnson, may- be confidered as the fruit 
of fuch expeditions in his day; But they 
had been difcontinued, as I apprehend, for 
many years. After the foundation of the 
Garden, this laudable practice was revived, 
and the affociations fixed to ftated periods^ 
and put under regulations; the herborizings 
being now diftinguifhed into private and 
general. The firft, intended to excite a 
tafte for botany among the apprentices of 
the Company, begin on the fecond Tuefday 
of April, and are held monthly, on the 
fame day, till September ihclufively, in fome 
of the villages in the immediate neighbour- 
hood of London. At the end of the feafon, 
the premium of a copy of Ray's Synopjisy 
(fince changed for Mr. Hudson's Flom 
Anglica) iS prefented to the young mah 
who has been the moft fuccefsful in difcd- 
vering and inveftigating the greateft num- 
ber of plants ♦ The general herborization 
is annual only, in Jiily ; when the Demon- 
ftrator, and others of the Court of Aflift- 
ants, belonging to the Company, make an 
excurfion to a confiderabk diftance from 
^ - the 



Chelfea Garden. , loi 

the city, collet the fcarce plants, and dine 
together near Lor^don j on which occafion 
they are frequently accompanied by other 
gentlemen, who are fond of the fame pur- 
fuits. 

This inftitution ^at Chelfea was rendered 
more.ftable, and received permanency, from 
the liberality of Sir Hans Sloan e ; who, 
foon after his purchafe of the manor, in 
1 72 1 , gave the freehold of the ground, near 
four acres, to the Company, on condition 
that the demonftrator (hould, in the name 
of the Company, deliver annually to the 
Royal Society fifty new plants, till the num- 
ber mould amount to 2000, all fpecifically 
different from each other ; the lift of which 
was publifhed yearly, in the Philofophical 
Tranjaiiions. The firft was printed in the 
year 1722, and the catalogues have been 
continued till the year 1773, at which time 
the number 2550 was completed, Thefe 
fpecimens are duly preferved in the archives 
of the Society, for the infpedlion of the cu- 
rious* 

Under excellent fuperlntendants, Chelfea 

Garden hasflouriihed; having been excelled, 

perhaps, by no public inftitution of the 

H 3 kind 



kind in Europe, for the number of Guridtf* 
exotics it contains. Of this, the Diftionary^ 
and Figures of the late Mr. Miller, af- 
ford fufEcient proofs. The advantages, in- 
deed of this inftitution are obvious ; and 
even Sir Hans Sloane himfelf acknow- 
ledged his obligations to it in the early part 
cf his life. 

In juftice to the memory of thofc: who 
have eminently filled the place of lec- 
turers, and demonftrators, in the Chelfed 
Garden, I recite their names, frorn the time 
of Sir Hans Sloan e's donation ; not being 
able to afcend above that period.

fay, helped to form, the Golden Age of Bo- 
tany^ before alluded to, was that growing 
tafte for the cultivation of exotics, which 
Iprung up among the great and opulent, 
after the happy return of internal peace by 
the Reftoration. Archibald Duke of Ak^ 
GYLE is faid to have been one of the firft, 
who wa^ confpicuous for the introdudtion 
of Foreign Trees, and Shrubs. Mr. Eve- 
lyn, both by his writings, and example, 
encouraged the fame tafte. He cultivated 
a garden and plantations at Sayes-^Court^ 
near Deptford-, and his Sylva remains a mo- 
nument of his learning, and patriotic in- 
tentions, which cannot foon be fuperfeded. 
After the Revolution, the Royal Gardens 
at Hampton-Court were rich in fine plants, 
and that at St. James's of no inconfiderable 
note, if we mayguefs by the many new plants 
Plukenet received from it. The Du- 
chefs ^'Beaufort had a garden richly 
ilored at Badmintony in GhucejlerJJnre. - Dr.

an Eaji India merchant ; of Mr. Courten,

afforded much affiftance to the labours of 
Ray, Plukenet, and Petiver. The 
growing commerce of the nation, the rnore 
frequent intercourfe with Hollandy where 
immenfe colle<3:ions from the Dutch colo- 
nies had been made, rendered thefe gratifi- 
cations more eafily attainable than before ; 
and, from all thefe happy coincidences, fci- 
cnce in general reaped great benefit, 

BISHOP c o M p T o N- 

• 

Among thofe I have juft eniimferated. 
Dr. Henry Com p ton, Bifhop of London^ 
claims peculiar notice; fince we learn from 
Mr. Ray, and Plukenet, that he joined 
to his tafte for gardening, a real and fcien^ 
tific knowledge of plants; an attainment not, 
ufual among the great, in thofe days. 

This eminent prelate, fo diflinguiihed 
for his zeal in the caufe of Proteftantifm, 
aiid for the aftive part he took in promot- 
ing the Revolution, was born in the year 
J 632* He was entered a nobleman of 

Queen's 



106 CHAPTER 54. 

Queen's College, Oxford^ in 1649, where 
he continued about three years ; and after- 
wards travelled abroad. After the Reftora- 
i^on, he entered into the army ; but very 
ibofl quitted it for the church. In the year 
1 666^ he became Rector of Cottenbam, in 
Cambridgejhire ; and, after pofleffing various 
emoluments in the church, was made Bi- 
fliop of Oxford, in the year 1674 ; and the 
year after^ tranllated to the See of London, 
which he held to the time of his death, in 
the year 171 3, at the age of 8i* 

In his retirement at Fulham, Bifliop 
Com p TON amply gratified himfelf in his 
favourite •amufement. The circumftances 
of the times, above mentioned, aided by his 
own 2eal, and a refidence of thirty-eight 
years on the fame See, enabled him, finally, 
' to colle<3: a greater variety of Green-houfc 
rarities, and to plant a greater variety of 
hardy Exotic Trees, and Shrubs, than had 
been feen in any garden before in England. 

This repofitory was ever open to the in- 
fye&ioTi of the curious and fcientific ; and 
we find Ray, Petiver, and Plukenet, 
in numerous inftanccs, acknowledging the 

aififtancca 



^ffiftances th^ received from the free com- 
munication of rare and new plants out of 
the garden at Fulham. Many of Pluke- 
net's figures were engraved from fpeci- 
mens out of the Bifhop's garden ; and fome 
from a book of drawings in his poflefEon^ 
quoted under the name of Codex Comptoni'^ 
enfis. 

In the fecond volume of Rav*s Hiftory 
of Plants,. p4 1798 J we find a Catalogue o£ 
fome new fpccies of l7rees and Plantsr, ob- 
ferved by the duthor in this garden. Thefe 
were principally of North American growth. 
The reader who is defirous of feeing a more 
ample account of the garden at Fulhaniy is 
referred to a relation of the ftate in which 
it was found in the year 1751, written by 
the late Sir William Watson, and printed 
in the 47th volume of the Philofophicai 
TranfaSiions.

DooDY, the contemporary and friend of 
Ray, Plukenet, andStoANE, who all 
bear teftimony to his merit. I regret the 
want of more information relating to this 
affiduous man; of whom I can only fay> 
that he was born in StaffordJInre^ was an 
apothecary. in London y and a fellow of the 
Royal Society. He was chofen fuperinten- 
dant, and demonftrator- of the Garden at 
Chelfea y an office he held for fome years be- 
fore hi^ death, which took place in 1706, 

As Mr, DooDY lived in London ^ and 
there is room to believe he was in very con- 
fiderable bufinefs, his excurfions could not 
ordinarily extend far from that city. In its 
neighbourhood, his diligence was beyond 
any other example. He ftruck out a new 
path in botany, by leading to the ftudy of 
that tribe, which comprehended the imper- 
fedl plants, now called the Qryptogamia 
clafs. In this branch he made the moft nu- 
merous difcoveries of. any man in that age, 
and in the knowledge of it ftoqd clearly un-- 
rivalled. The early editions of R Ay 's*Sy;^^^- 
Jis were much amplified by his labours j and 
he is reprefented by Mr. Ray, as a man 

of 



of uncommon fagacity in difcovering and 
difcriminating plants in generaL The 
learned fucceflbr of Tournefort^ M. Jus- 
siEU, fpeaks of him as inter Pharfnacopneos

There is a long lift of rare plants, many 
of them new, arid firft difcovered by Mr.

'PDWARD Llhwyd was one of the 
^^ moft learned and celebrated antiquaries 
of the laft century^ and a fkilful naturalift,. 
According to Mr. TFood, he was the fon of 
Edward Llhwyd, or Lloyd, of Kidnvell, in 
Carmartbenjhire ; but, as Boyer relates, of 
Charles Llhwyd^ oiLanvordia, in Salop, Ef(j. 
He was born in 1670, and became a ftu.- 
ident of Jefus College in 1687, of which 
Pr.PLOT was a member, and under whom 
Mr^ Llhwyd was in a great meafurc edu* 



Llbwyid. lit 

catcd. On the rcfignation of Dr. pLOTt 
he fucceeded him as keeper of the AJbmo^ 
laan Mufeum^ about 1690. He travelled 
repeatedly all over Wales i went through the 
North of Scot/a/id ; into Ire/and^ in which 
kingdom he feems to have made fome coa-» 
fiderable abode. Hefpent fome time ia Carjn-^ 
wal/, and in Britany in France, in fearch of . 
antiquities, and materials to carry on the 
extenfive defigns he had formed. 

In all thefe journies he was conftantly 
attentive to the objeds of natural hiftory, 
fofiils, plants, and any remarkable phaeno-- 
mena of nature. Siich of his remarks as 
are publiihqd in the Pbilofophical Tran/ac^ 
tiom, are full of curious and new informa-- 
tion on thefe fubjedls. His knowledge of 
the plants of his own country, and parti- 
cularly thofe of Wales, juftly entitles him 
to remembrance in thefe pages, although fad 
was not profefledly an authpr on the fubjedk 
of them* 

Llhwvd firft brought to light feveral 
of the rare pUnts of Wales ; many of which, 
till of ]ate yjears, were confidered as natives 
of no pther part of Britain. He difcovesed 

fcveral 



112 C H A P T E R 35* 

feveral very fcarce fpecies in Cornwall : all 
thcfe he communicated to Mr. Ray, who 
inferted them in the editions of his Synopjis^ 
with due acknowledgments. After having 
made very large collections for the antiquities 
of JValeSy and formed great defigns in litera* 
ture, he died before he could digeft them 
into order for publication, in July 1709. - 

Exclufive'of large communications, made 
to BiHiop Gibson's edition oi Camden, on 
the antiquities of TFales, he formed, from 
the fruit of his own inveftigations, the Liji 
of Plants fubjoined to the account of that 
Country. 

He publillied, ^' Lithophylacii Bri-

the AJl^mokan Mufeum, confiding of 1766 
articles, was .printed at the expence of Sir 
Ifaac Newton, Sir Hans Sloane, and a 
few others of his learned friends. As only 
120 copies were printed, a new edition of it 
was publifhed in 1760 by Mr. Huddesford-,

in drawing up a Catalogue of Mr. Ash-

long be remembered among the lovers of 
antiquity. 

From private information, I hav6 learned 
that Mf. Llhwyd left a very confiderabld 
library^ a large collbdibri of mahufcripts 
tod fpecimehs; that in the year 1728, thefe

At this period muft alfo be introduced 
Dr. T A NCR ED Robinson, phyfician, 
in London, and fellow of the Royal CoI-» 
lege of Phyficians, and of the Royd So- 
ciety, between whom and Mr. RAy there 
fubfifted the moft genuine friendfhip and 
afFe<ftion. Amicorum Alpha is the diftinc- 
tion which Ray gives him. The printed 
corrrefpondence between them commences! 
during Dr. Robinson's travels abroad, iii 
1683, and is continued for upwards of ten 
years. Seventeen letters of Dr. Rot in*

Theft letters, and the publications of 
Dr. Robinson, in the Phihfopbical Tranf^ 
aSiions^ prove him to have ban a iriian wdl 
acquainted with various parts of learning ; 
to which he adde4 alfo an intimate know^ 
^edge of natural. hiftory, and in which he 
muft have been very early initiated 5 fince 
Ray, in the Prefaces to his Hijioria Plan^ 
iarum, in 1686, acknowledges, in-ftrong 
terms, his obligations to him, for his care 
and affiduity in correding and enriching his 
work J adding, that he had exerted himfclf 
with a zeal that could not have been ex- 
ceeded, h^d the work been entirely his 
own. 

Mr. Ray afterwards put into his hahdc 
the manufcript of the Synopjls, and renewed 
his acknowledgments- for the benejfit it re-

until about the year 1730 ; about which 
time he became a Licentiate of the College 
of Phyficians, and was eledted a Fellow of 
the Royal Society. At this time, I appre-

He publifhed Ph armacologi a, f. Ma^

printed in 8% 1693, with the fandion of

editions of it printed abroad^ It was rp- 
publifhed at London in 1705 and 17 16, 8% 
and a third time in 4% in 1737, pp. 460 ; 
which edition, is much improved and en- 
larged. The arrangement of the work 
is that of Ray 5 and, to each chapter| 
throughout the vegetable kingdom, he 
has prefixed the charadlers of the genue,^ 
from the Methodus Emendata of that au- 
thor. He has moreover, with great labour, 
conftrufted z Syllabus ^ or fynoptical view

yeral excellent publications had taken place 
abroad, which, aided by improvements at 
home, enabled Dale to felefl: better materi- 
als, and give his laft edition the importance 
of a new work. Scarcely in any author is 
there a more copious coUeftion of fynonyms, 
a circumftance which, independent of much 
other intrific worth, will long continue the

purfue the hiftory of any article through alj 
former writers on the fubjed.

?676, with large qotes, amounting to mucl^ 
the greater part of the book, flqwfoever 
refpedable our author may appear as an an^ 
tiquary in this volume, he is equally fo as a 
paturalift, in general. His Hiftory of the 
Figured Foflils of the Cliff is very exad, 

an4 



And copious; and the view he has given, lA 
a fhort compafs, of the various opinions 
relating to the origin bf thefe bodies, as 
held by the writers of the laft, arid the 
beginning of the prefent century, is vety 
fatisfadory. 

His Synopfis of the animals and vegetable^ 
of the neighbouring fea and cOaft, proved 
his intimate and critical knowledge of his 
fubjeds I and being embelliftied with feve- 
ral good copper-plates, renders his book a 
real acquifition to fcience. 

It is highly probable, that, from their 
vicinity to each other. Dale owed to Mr. 
Ray, his attachment to natural hiftory, 
and the great proficiency he fo early made 
in that ftudy. We find Mr. Ray acknow- 
ledging his affiftance in colleding, and ex- 
tricating the fynonyms of plants, corredl- 
ing errors, and fupplying omiffions, for his 
Hijloria Plantarum^ of which the imprima^

not b^ more than 26 years old.

jyiCHARD Bradley, a popular writ- 
er on Gardening and Agriculture, in the 
early part of this century, was one of tl#firft 
who treated thefe fubjedls in a philofophical 
manner; and, as he poflelTed confiderable 
botanical knowledge, is entitled to a place in 
thefe Anecdotes. He firft made himfelf 
known to the public by two papers, printed 
in the xxixth Volume of the Philofophical 
TranJaSlions. One ''on the Motion of the Sap 
*' in Vegetables * :" the other, '' on the quick 
*' Growth of Mouldinefs on Melons +.'' He

was chofen Profeflbr of Botany in the Uni- ^ 
verfity of Cambridge, in 1724. Bradley 
was the author of more than twenty fepa- 
rate publications; chiefly on Gardening and 
Agriculture, publifhed between the years 
1716 and 1730, 

His *• New Improvement of Planting 
'* ^nd Gardening, both Philofophical and 
*' Pradical," 8% 1717/ went through re- ' 
peated impreffionsj as did his Gentleman's 
** and Gardener's Kalendar," (which was 
the fourth part of the preceding book) both 
at home, and in tranflations abroad. His 
" Philofophical Account of the Works of 
^* Nature," 4''. 1721, was a popular, in- 
ftrudWe, and entertaining work, and con*- 
tinned in- repute feveral years. The fame 
may be faid of his *' General Treatife of 
" Husbandry and Gardening," 8% 2^ Vol. 
1726 ; and of his ** Pradiical Difcourfes 
" concerning the four Elements, as they 
'' relate to the Growth of Plants." 8% 

1727. His^^ DiBionarium Botanicum'' 8\ 

1728, was, I believe, the iirft attempt of 
the kind in Kngland. 

' Mn Bradley was not eminent for any 

difcoveries relating to the indigenous plants

oF England ; but exotic botany was indebt- 
ed to him for an undertaking, which there , 
is reafon to regret he was not enabled to 
purfue and perfedl. I mean his book on 
Succulent Plants. As this tribe is incapa- 
ble of being advantageoufly preferved in a 
Hortus Siccus, there is no part of botany 
that calls more eflentially for a feparate 
publication. His work bears the following 
title, *^ HisTORiA Plantarum Succir- 
rENTARUM, compleSlens hafce infequentes; 
Planfasy Alomfcilkety Picoiden^ Cereos, Me^ 
Ibcardium, aliqfque ejus generis quce in Horto

171 6. t. 50. It was publilhed in* Decads, 
.at different times, between the years 17 16 
and 1727; of which only five were com- 
pleted. The whole was republiflied in 1734. 
The defcriptions are in Latin ahd Englifh, 
and the figures extremely well 'done in the 
flile of the time. It preferves its value, as 
being cited by Linn je us, and as containing 
fome plants not figured in any other pub- 

K 2 lication.

lication. A ipecies of SeJum is the only 
indigenous plant contained in it* 

Bradley gave a courfc of L/e(aure$ on 
the Materia Medica^ in London^ in the year 
1729, which hepubliihed in 8*, in thefuc- 
ceeding year. He died at the latter end of 
1732. 

Although Bradley's writings do not 
abound in new difcoveries, yet they are not 
deftitute of interefting knowledge, coUeded 
from contemporary gardeners, and from 
books. He was an advocate for the circu- 
lation of the fap, and made feveral new ob- 
fervations on the fexes of plants, in confc- 
quence of the produdtion of hybrid fpecies, 
by which he added ftrength to that doc- 
trine. He wrote inflrudtivdy on the gems 
of trees ; on bulbs ; on grafting ; and par- 
ticularly, on the methods of producing va- 
negated and double flowers. 

On the whole, Bradley's writing*, 
coinciding with the growing tafte for gar- 
dening, the inttodudion of exotics, and 
knprbvements in hulbandry, contributed to 
•xcite a more philofophical view of thefc 

arts»

arts, and difFufe a general and popular 
knowledgo of them throughout the king* 
dom. 

The induftry and talents of Bradley 
were not mean ; and though unadorned by- 
learning, were fufficlent to have fecured to 
him, that reputable degree of refpedl from 
pofterity, which it will ever juflly with- 
hold from him who fails to recommend 
fuch qualifications, by integrity and pro- 
priety of conduct. In thefe, unhappily, 
Mr. Bradley was deficient. We Mm, 
from the account given of him by Mr. 
Martyn, that he procured the profeffor- 
Ihip in a clandeftine and fraudulent man- 
ner, and afterwards neglected to perform the 
duties of it. The Univerfity, neverthelefs, 
iallowed^him to retain the nominal diftinftion 
of Profeflbr, and appointed Dr. Martyn 
to give the ledlures. Near the conclufion 
of his life, his conduct was fo unbecoming, 
that it was in agitation to deprive him of 
this nominal title.

Blair. 

Dr. Patrick Blair was a native of ScQt^ 
landy and pradtifed phyfic and furgcry at 
Dundee ; where he made himfelf firft known 
as an anatomift^ by the difTediion of an ele« 
phant, which died near that place, in 1706. 
He was a Nonjuror, and fo far attached 
to the exiled family, as to have been im- 
prifoned in the rebellion in 171 5f as a 
fufpedled pcrfon. He afterwards removed 
to London^ where he recommended himfelf 
to the Royal Society y by fome Difcourfes on 
the Sexes of Flowers, His ftay in London 
was not long ; he quitted it, and fettled at 
Bojiony in Lincoln/hire ; where, if I miilake 
not, he pradtifed phyfic during the remain- 
der of his life. I ^m not able to afcer-, 
tain the time of his deceafe; but I con- 
jedlure that it was foon after the publica*^ 
tion of the Seventh Decad of his Pharmacol 
botanologiay in 1728. 

Dr. Blair's firft publication was inti- 
tuled *^ Mifcellaneous Obfervations in Phy-t

work, he mfinuates feme doubts relating to 
the method fuggefted by Petiver, and 
others^ of deducing the qualities of vege- 
. tables, from the agreement in natural cha- 
ra<flers ; and inftances thp Cynoglojfum^ as ' 
tending to prove the fallacy of thfs rule. 
He relates feveral inftances of the poifonous 
effcdts of plants ; and thinks the Echium 
Mariniim fPuImonaria Maritima Lin.) 
fliould be ranked in the genus Cymglojfum^ 
fince it poiTeffes a narcotic power. He 
dcfcribes, and figures, feveral of the more 
rare Britijh plants, which he had difcover- 
ed in a tour made into Wales, e. g.' The

^ Dr. BLiiiR's treatlfe, as far as I can find; 
was the firft complcat work, at Icaft, in 
the Englifh language, written on the fub- 
jcfts and the author (hews himfelf well ac- 
quainted, in general, with all the opinions, 
and arguments of authors, on the matter 
of each eflay. The value of thefe EJfays 
muft iiot be cftimated by the meafure of 
modern knowledge, though even at this 
day, they may be read by thofe not criti- 
cally verfed in the fubjedt, with inftruftiort 
iand improvement. A view of the feveral 
methods then invented, cannot be feen fo 
connectedly exhibited in any other Engltjh 
author. Dr. Blair ftrengthened the ar- 
guments in proof of the Sexes of Plants, 
by found reafoning, and fome new experi- 
ments. His reafons againft Morland's 
opinion, of the entrance of the Farina in- 
to the Vafculum feminale^ and his refuta- 
tion of the Lewenhoekian theory, have met 
with the fandiion of the moderns. If his

DR. WILLIAM SHERARD. 

TjT/^ILLIAM Sherard, or Sherwood, 
the fon oi George Sherwood, oiBujhby, 
in Leicefierfhire, was born in 1659, and 
educated at Merchant Taylors* School, 
till he was entered at St. Johrts College, 
Oxford^ in the year 1677. ^^ '^^^ college 
he became a Fellow, and took the degree of 
Bachelor of Law, Dec. 11, 1683. After 
this time, he accompanied Lord Vifcount 
^ownfhend in his travels i and difcharged 

his 



142 CHAPTER 38. 

his trufl with fo much reputation, that 
he was prevailed on to take the charge of 
Wriothejly^ grandfon of Willianiy firft Duke 
of Bedford; and made a fecond tour to 
the continent, with equal fatisfadion to the 
noble family who confided in him. 

He returned from this tour, as I con-^ 
jedture, about the year 1693; and commu- 
nicated to Mr., Ray a Catalogue of Plants, 
which he had remarked on Mount Jwa^ 
SalevCy and the neighbourhood of Genevan 
This was pu-blifhed as a Supplement in' 
Ray's " Sylloge Stirpiutn EuropcearumJ' 
About this tim.e we find he was in Ireland, 
with his friend Sir Arthur Rawdon, at 
Moyra I of whom mention has been made 
in the article Sloan E. 

In travelling, Sherard gratified his fa- 
vourite paffion, and formed connexions 
with the moft celebrated charaders on the 
continent, HeIiman, Boeriiaave, and 
Tour NE FORT. He was very early fkilled 
in Englijh botany; and although his publi- 
cations are few, there is no doubt that he 
had beftowed great affiduity in the ftudy of 
Engltjh plants. Need I allege .any farther 

evidence. 



Dr. Shera?'d. ,   143 

evidence, than the obligations, already men- 
tioned, which Mr. Ray acknowledges for 
affiftance in his *• Hiftory of Plants." 
He travelled early into various parts of 
Englandj and was ever attentive to rriake 
difcoveries. He made the tour of the Weft: 
as far as into Cornwall. He fearched the 
ifland of yerfey^ and communicated a Lift: 
of Plants to Mr. Ray, to be inferted in 
the firft edition of the Synopjis^ printed in 
1690. 

He is.faid to have been the author of 
a book publifhed under the name of Samuel 
Wharton, '* Scbola Botanical Jive, Cata^ 
logus 'Plant arum quas ab aliquot Afznis in Harto * 
Regio Barijienji Studiojis indigitavit J of. Pet. 
TouRNEFORT." Amjl. \t^(). Az"" . It was 
reprinted in 169.1, and 1699. If indeed 
Sherard was the author of this book, he 
muft have attended the ledures of Tour ne-» 
FORT three feveral feafons. It contains a 
rude Iketch of Tour ne fort's Method of 
Botany, exemplified in a large catalogue of 
plants ; among which are innumerable va- 
rieties, fomc new (pecies colleflied by 
ToURNEFORT himfclf in the Pyrencean 

Mountains,

Mountains, and others introduced by the 
care of M. Faqon. 

It is to Sherard alfo, that the learned 
owe the publication of Herman's ** Para^ 
difus Batavus, continens plus centum Plantar 
affabre Mre incifas^ et Defcfiptionibus illuf- 
tratas,'' 4*. Lugd. Bat. 1698, He wrote 
a preface to this work, in which he relates 
the difficulties he met with, in reducing the 
author's papers into method; and which 
contains an account of other, works of 
J^Ierman. This preface is dated from Ge^ 
neva, in April 1697; at which time, I ap- 
prehend, Sherard was on his third tour, 
on the continent. ' 

. In the year 1700, Mr. Sherard com- 
municated to the Royal Society a Method 
of making feveral CAina Varnifhes, which 
were fent from the Jefuits in C&ina to the 
Great Duke of Tufcany. It was publiflied 
in the Philofophical T^ranfaSlions, N' 262. 
Vol. xxii. p. 525. And the next year he 
communicated to the Society a paper from 
Dr. J. DEL Passa,. on the poifonous Ef- 
feds of the Indian Varnifli on the humaa 
Skin ; which on the naked Skin of Poultry 

proved 



proved quite harmlefs. How foon after 
this time he was engaged in any public 
employment, I cannot determine : but, i^ 
1702, he was ofte of the.commiflioners for 
fick and wounded feamen at Port/mouth i 
and, I believe, was foon after appointefd 
confui at Smyrna I a department, which, it 
is probable, his defire of inveftigating the 
plants of the Eaft. had no fmall (hare in 
inducing him to accept. But Sherard « 
knowledge and tafte was. not confined. to 
the ftudy of botany. Mr. Martyn in- 
forms us, that, ".in 1705, with Antonio 
PiCKNiNi, he vifitcd the feven churches of 
Afid. In 1709 and 1716, he tranfcribed 
the Monumenta Teia^ and caufed the Sigean 
inicription to be copied and fent to Eng-^ 
/and ; and the learned Dr. Chishull de- 
dicates his account of it to him." He alfo 
fcnt an account of the ifland raifed near 
Santorini, in the Archipelago^ on the 12th 
of May, 1707; which was printed in the 
Philofopbical^ranfaiiions, N'3i4. Vol.xxii. 

p. 67.^ ; 

During his refidence at Smyrna^ he had

whidi time, lie had the degree of Dodtc^ 
of Laws Conferred upon him by the Uni- 
verfity of Oxford. 

In 1721, Dr. Sherard communicated 
to the Rc^al Society an. Account of the 
Poiibn Wood Tree of New England, which 
he had received from Mr. More. It does*

In this year he returned to the continent^ 
And made the tour of Holland, France, and 
Itafy. Whaft at Parts, he found Vail- 
SLANT in a declining ftate of health ; but, 
anxious to preferve his papers from obli-% 
vion, Vaillant had folicited Boer- 
HAAVE to purchafc, and to publifh them. 
Sherard negocia,te4 the bufiqeis^ and 
fpent the greateft part of the fummer with 
BoERHAAVE, in reducing the manufcripta 
into order. To Sijerard, therefore, prin- 
cipally, the learned owe the Botanicon Pa-- 
rijienfe, which was publiihed in lyij. 
BoERHAAVE prefixed to this work ^ Latin 
ktter, written by Dr. Sherard, giving 
an account of this tranfa<5tion; which i^ 
alfo more fully explained in the pre^ce. 
It was in this tour, that, being in iearch of 
plants in the Alj^s, he narrowly efcapcd be- 
ing ihot by a pea&nt for a wolf. 

On his return, he brought ov^ widi 
him the celebrated Dillenius, with 

L 2 whom 



148 C H A P T*E R 38. 

whom }ie had before correffHondedj; and 
whom he had encouraged to profecute Kis 
enquiries into the Cryptogamia clafs, and in 
publiihing his Planta Giffenfes. Sh ek a rd 
had himfelf been among the earlieft in 
England^ to promote attention to this hi- 
therto negledted part of nature; and in this 
DiLLENius had already excelled all who 
had written before him. 

Although Dr. Sherard had acquired 
a coniiderable fortune in Afia^ yet he lived 
with the greateft privacy in London, wholly 
immeried in the ftudy of natural hiftory ; 
except when he went to his brother's feat 
and fine garden at Eltbam. Dr. Dil- 
LENius aflifted him in his chief employ-- 
ment^ the carrying on his Pinaxy or.Col- 
kiftion of all the names, which had been 
given by botanical writers to each plant ; 
being a continuation of Cafpar Bauhine's 
^reat plan. 

Dr. Sherard was, in a particular man- 
ner, the patron of Mv.'Mark Catesbyj 
and himfelf affixed the Latin names to the 
plants of « The Natural Hiftory of Caro- 
«' Una:: 

Ha 



Dr. Sherard. 149 

He died Auguft 12, 1728 ^ and, J>y his 
will, gave three thoufand pounds, to pro- 
vide a falary for a profeflbr of botany at, 
Oxfordy on condition, that Dr. Dillenius 
ihould be chofcn firft profeflbr. Heeredled 
the edifice at the entrance of the garden, for 
the ufc of the profeflbr 5 and. gave to this^ 
cftablifliment his botanical library, his JEZir^ 
barium^ and the Pmax. 

Dr. Sherard was among the laft of 
thofe ornaments in 'England^ of that aera 
which LiNN^us calls ** the golden age 
of botany." Having from his earliefl: years 
a relifh for the fludy of natural hiftory, 
and in his youth acquired a knowledge: 
of Euglijh bqtany, his repeated tours to 
the continent, and his long refidence i^ 
the Eaft, afforded ample fcope for his im- 
provement; and the acquifition of affluence, 
joined to his learning, and agreeable quali- 
ties, rendered him, after his return home, 
a liberal ahd zealous patron of the fcience, 
and of thofe who cultivated it ^^* 

Some 

-• Vaillant firft devoted the mmt Sherar£a to a^ 
new genus, which was afterwards affimilated with thq 
L3 Vervain*, 



15<5 CHAPTER 38. 

Some manufcripts of Dr. Sh£Rard*s 
were prcfentcd to the Royil Society by Mr. 
Bllis^ in the year 1766. 

J. S H £ R A R D, 

* ^ames^ the brother of William Sher ard» 
, was born in 1666 He pra<fHfed phyfic as 
an apothecary in London^ and was early anti 
ftrongly attached to his brother's favourite 
purftiit. Having become eminent and opu- 
lent in his profeflion, he t:ultivated3 at his 
country feat, at Eltbam, in Kent^ one of the 
richeft gardens that England ever pofleflcd. 
It was alio the retirement of his brother, 
Ae conful, after his return from Smyrna ; 
and is immortalized by the pen of DiIle* 
ikius. Mn Sherard is not known as an 
author ; but his name frequently occurs in 
Ray's Synopjisj for his difcoveries of rare 
EngKfi plants i of which he had great 
knowledge, as he is faid to have had of na- 
tural hiftory in general j and his zeal for 

Vervain^ About the fame time, Dillenius gave die 
like appellation, in his Flora Gijfenjisj to an EngUJh plant 
of the Sulkud da&, in the fyftem 6f Ray, which retsdns

to whofe botanical fame he gave an* emi*

of Rav* It was no mesin fecrifice to re- 
linquifh his country, his friends, his con? 
ncxiojis, and his profpeds from a prof^f- 
fion, which is, at leaift fometiraes, lucratiye, 
that he might devote hipafclf ^o the culture 
of fcience» in a foreign land, where the eic- 
tent of bis Vkw^ was moil probably bound- 
ed by the precarious hope of a profefibrihip 
alone. 

\ y^^ yacoi DiLL'ENius * was bom at 
Darmjiadtj in Germany y in the year 168^. 
It appears that he had his education, prin- 
cipally at the univerfity of Giefferiy a city of 
Vpper Hejfe ; ltA where, probably, his fa- 
Biily had coniidcrable intereft and con- 
i^exions ; fince I find two of his contempo*

a profeflbr of m'i^cine» and dean of the fa- 
culty of phyfic at that place; and the other, 
Poliater^ or public phyficiani an office, I 
believe, not uncommon in Germany^ though 
unknown here; and which Dillenius 
himfeif held in the fame city. He was very 
early made a member of the Academia Cu-- 
riafortim Germanta. He communicated fe- 
veral papers to that fociety, which werer 
publifhed in their MifceUanea Curiofa. The 
earlieft, that I find, was a DifTertation, in 
the Third Century ofObfervations^ about the 
year 171 5^ concerning the plants oi Ame^ 
rica which are naturalized in 'Europe. Thi» 
iiB a fubjed: which might again be taken up 
by a fkilful hand, to great advantage. The 
refult of obfervation, and communication 
on this matter, would unqueftionably prove, 
that a far greater number of plants than we 
are aware of, which are now thought to be 
indigenous in Europe^ were of exotic origiij.. 
Befides the moft obvious method, from the 
garden to the dunghill, and from thence to 
the field, amongft a variety of other caufes, 
the importation of grain has introduced a 
great number ; the p^kage of merchan-

difc, and the clearing out of fliips/ hare 
been the means of difperling many. The 
Englifh Flora, as it now (lands, cannot con- 
tain fewer, perhaps, than fixty acknowledged 
fpecies ^ and a critical examination would 
probably inveftigate a much greater num- 
ber. 

In the Fourth Century oi the fame work, 
we find a critical diflertation on the fCahve) 
coffee of the Arabians : and oa European 
coffee, or fuch as may be prepared from. 
grain or pulfe. Dillenius gives the re- 
fult of his own preparations made with 
peafe, beans, and kidney beans ; but fays, 
that from rye comes the neareft to true 
Cof^e, and was with difficulty diftinguifhed 
from it. 

In the Sixth Century, he has defcribed 
and figured four fpecies of dubious plants ;. 
three of the Spergula genus, now Arenarice ^. 
and a Veronica. 

In' the Appendix to this Century, Dil- 
lenius gave the firft fpecimen of his ac- 
curate examination of fome plants of the 
Cryptogamous clafs i which he afterwards 
purlued fo greatly to the iqiprovement of 
, ' botany. 



Diiknius. i^j 

]>otany. In this paper, Dilleniijs treats 
on the propagation of plants in general ; 
but more particularly on that of the Ferns^ 
or capillary plants ; and of the Mojfes^ v^hich 
had hitherto been confidered as deftitute of 
flower and feed^ He defcribes the flowers 
of that genus, which he afterwards called 
Lichenajirunft and which was named by Mi- 
chel i, Jungermannia. He delineates two 
of the Chara genus -, fome of the Conferva i 
and feveral of the more pcrfedt plants, parti- 
cularly the Chondrilla. He fixed the genus 
Radioki Corrigiolay &c. and particularly the 
Centunculus; and Cameraria^ which was 
afterwards called Montia. To thefe he fub- 
joins maiiy curious obfervations on tKe ufeof 
the petals zndjiaminay all tending to confirm 
the dodtrine of ihtfexes pf plants; obferva- 
tions on the root of the Equifetum -, on the 
duft of the Antherce^ and on the different 
ihape of that in the Orchis^ which he lays 
is conical ; and of that in the Opbrys, which 
i$ round. 

In the Ninth Century of the fame work,. 
he relates an experiment he made concern- 
ing 



158 C H A P T E k 39. 

ing the Opium which he prepared faimielf^ 
from the poppy of 'European growth. 

In the Eighth Century^ he appears as a 
zoologift, in a paper on Leeches i and de- 
icribes two fpecies of the Papilio genus. 

In 171 9> he publifhed his " Catalogue

had written in a ftile that was but too re- 
prehenfible; and can only be excufed, in 
ibme meafure, as natural to the warmth of 
a young author % though it has been gene- 
rally acknowledged, that he had the advan- 
tage in the argument. 

Nothing can fliew the early fkill and in« 
defatigable induftry of Dilleniu^ mora 
ftfongly, than his being able to produce io.

He has not enumerated fewer than 980 
ipecies, of what were then called the more 
perfed plants ; that is^ exclufive of the 
Mujhroom clafs, and all the Mojfes. Dil^ 
jLENius entered minutely into the examina- 
tion of this clafs \ and^ by his diligence and 
(Hfcoveries, extended the bounds of that 
£eld, which the Englijh botanifts had Co 
/uccefsfuUy cultivated before him. More 
had been done in England in this way than 
in any other nation. The Pinax of Co/par 
Bauhine contains but fifty fpecies; fo 
little had the Mu/ci been regarded before. 
The firft edition of Ray's Synopjis^ printed 
in 1690, not more than about eighty 
kinds ; whereas by the inveftigations of the 
Englijh botanifts, particularly of Doody, 
Sherard, Vernon, Llhwyd, Robin- 
son^ Petiver, Bob art, and others, this 
order was fo far augmented in the fecond 
edition of the fame work, in 1696, as to 
contain upwards of 170 fpecies. 

DiLXENius was, however, the firft wri- 
ter who examined them with a view to ge- 
nerical charad;efs, and divided the iUT^^j*, 
^ and Mujhrooms^ each into feparate . genera^

It is ifr this book that we firft meet with 
Bryum, Hypbum, Mmum, SpAagnum, Liche-^ 
noides^ and Lichenajirum, as generical napies., 
The four firft of thefe, were terms in ufe 
with the Patres Botani(;iy although neglcifled 
by the reftorers^^of the fcience, who had 
.ranked all under the general term Mufcusi 
except the Lichen^ Lycopodiuniy and Polytri^ 
chum. To demonftrate his accuracy and 
diligence, it may be obferved, that, in the 
environs of G/^^ alone, Dillenius dif- 
covered more than 200 fpecies oi Moffes^ 
of which 140 were new : of the Mujhroom 
order he enumerates 160, of which up- 
wards of 90 were fuch as he judged had 
not been noticed by any author before^ 
The plants in this catalogue are difpofed 
in the order of flowering, throughout, all 
the year. The places of growth are fub- 
joined, with critical obfervations on many 
of the fpecies. 

The Appendix contains a lift of twenty, 
plants, additional to thofe of the Cata- 
logue, difcovered in the immediate environs 
of Giejfen ; and an enumeration of upwards 
of 100 fpecies, obferved by the author, be**

yond the bounds circumfcribed in the C^ 
lalogue. This renders the book, in a great 
meafure, a Flora of the plants of He^^ 
Then follows a defcription of the ««o fpe- 
cies of the Catalogue. Thefe are fucceeded 
by the eftablifhraent of hiai new genera of 
Moffes^ Fungi^ and a variety of others^ a- 
mounting to near loo^ of which fome of 
former authors are here only amended > but 
the far greater part are of his own con* 
ftrudiing^ and entirely new ; and the parts 
of frudification ieparately delineated; in i6 
copper-plates. This part of his work ha^ 
been of great authority with fucceedihg 
writers; and many of thefe characters hava 
ftood the teft of the Linnaan fyftem. 

The merit of this work fixed the cha* 
radter of the author, as a perfeftly fcienti^ 
f\z botanift, and attra<^d the notice of. all 
the emihent profeflbrs, and admirers of the 
fcience: among others, that of Mr. IVilliam^ 
afterwards Dr. Sherard, to whom we 
owe that Dillenius was brought to Eng-^ 
land^ and in the end fixed in the profefibr- 
ihip at Oxford. Sherard was, at that 
time, among the few who patronized and 
cultivated the fcience in England^^ He was 

lateljr 



Dilkniuu tt% 

lately fetbrlieii fmmSmyrnd; and having 
regretted the negkiSfc of the Cryptogamia 
clafs, he was (o enamoured with the difco- 
veries of DiLLENius in that branch> that 
he entered into Correfpondence with him, 
and procured fpecimens from him, and 
afterwards brought him to England. No 
man was more clofely devoted to a fevourite 
mufe than Dxllenius was to Flora i and, 
after his arrival in England^ he purfued his. 
ftudy with uncommon ardour^ and corre- 
fponding diligencCi The acquifition of fo* 
able a man> was probably an additional jno-* 
tive with the Confulj to attempt the revi** 
val of botany in the univerfity of Oxford. 

DiLLENius came into England in Au«* 
guft 1721, where he had not Idng refided 
before he Undertook a work that was much 
defired; that of publifhing a new edition 
of the Synopjis Stirpium Britannicarum of 
Ray. It had been laft printed in 1696,. 
and was become fcarcc. DilleniWs hav- 
ing firmly attached himfelf to Ray's (yf-* 
tern, and even improved it in fome parts 
(though he intimates in one of his letters 
to a friend, that he was not allowed to 
M % make 



16+ Chapter 3^* 

make all the changes he wifhed for), afid 
being furnifhed^ with ample means of en-^ 
larging the bookj by his difcovery of new 
fpecies of Cryptogamia^ and by the eftab-^ 
liifhment of new genera ; being alfo enabled^ 
by the difcoveries of many ingenious mcn^' 
whofe names he enumerates in the preface, 
greatly to enlarge Englijh botany; and^ 
through the fkill and affiftance of Dr. Ri- 
chardson, Mr. James SherarD, and 
others, beihg fufficiently qualificfd to add 
the old BritijJoy if I may fo fay, to the Eng^ 
lijh botany, he publifhed a third edition in 
T724, much to the fatlsfadion of all the 
lovers of the fcience throughout Europe. 
Twenty-four plates of fare plants were add- 
ed to this edition ; and, befides many valu- 
able notes, and emendations in the genera, 
the addition of new fpecies was very great. 
The accumulation to this book from Dil- 
LENius's own difcoveries, and from the 
communications of others, whofe names are 
mentioned in the preface, particularly thofe 
of Dr. Sherard and Dr. Richardson, 
amounted to near 40 new Fungi^ as many 
Marine plants, upwards of 150 Mojfes, and

confijderably above 200 other plants, which 
had been difcovered to be natives oi Britain.

DiLLENius feems to have divided hi$ 
time, before his eftabliihtnent at Oxford, 
principally between the country refidence 
pf Mr, y^«z^J Sherard, at E/t6am,i^ 
Kent; the CgnfuVs houfe in town; aTi4

were in Barking All^.

yleafed with the harfh and coarfc language 
of Threlkeld's criticifms, had temper 
enough to forbear entering into any con- 
troverfy on this occafion. He probably did 
jiot think Threlkeld's objeftions of any 
force fufficient to influence men of judg* 
ment in the fciencc, as the Irijh botanift 
had but little regarded any true principles 
of generical diftindlion. In a letter he 
wrote foon after the publication of the Irifl^ 
FlorUy after complaining of the groffncfe 
of Threlkeld's cenfures, he informs his 
correfpondent that there was but one plant 
recited in the book, which was not known 
before as a native of Ireland. This, he 
adds, is the Pfeudo-Jiacbys jUpma of Cafpar 
Bauhine fStachys Alpina Lin.) ; and Ais 
lie had inferted on the authority of Mr.

letter to a correfpondent of that county, 
dated Dec, i6, 1727, he writes thus:

-fince his refidence in England^ his employ- 
ments had been various, and important, and 
his afGduity as diflinguifhed as his abilities. 
Since his arrival in 1721, he had publiflied 
l}ie Synopjis^ of which he defigned, if he 
did not himfclf engrave, all the figures. 
He foon after began the Hortus Elthamenfis. 
He colleded materials for a new edition of;

tional to all which, the bufinefs of the P/- 
nax appears to have been purfued with 
vigour. In a letter dated Dec. 26, 1727, 
he fays, *' We have entered almoft all au-

been laid fo eariy as the year 1724, imme^ 
diately after publifhingthe Synopfisy and fome 
of the plants were figurecf and dcfcribed be- 
fore Dr. Sherard's death. The work wad 
now carried on with vigour, and was print- 
ed in 1732, under the following title :

pofed in the alphabetical order. The fi^ 
gures are of the natural fize as much as may 
be. The fynonyma of former authors ar? 
quoted and accompanied by copious critical 
examinations and obfervations, the better to 
afcertain the fpecies. Several new genera 
are eftablifhed, many of the new Gerania 
are figured, and a very copious hiftory of 
the genus 'Mefemhryanthemum given ; with a 
fynoptical view of all the fpecies, of which 
fifty-four are defcribed and figured in this

his merit ; and, as I have obferved on an- 
other occafion, cxpreffed himfelf in thefc 
terms : " In Anglia nullus efi quvgenera cu-- 
rat vel intelligat praterquar^ Dillekius." 

LiNNi?EUs, after this time, correfponded 
with him, fent him his Flora Lapponica^ 
and dedicated to him the Critica Botanica. 
Qn which occafion the Profeflbr fent his 
acknowledgments in the following terms, 
in a letter, dated Aug. i8, 1737 : ** Vidi, 
accept et legi Floram tuam Lapponicam tnulta 
cum voluptate 'y utinam plures ijiiufmodi nobis 
profiarent talijludioy et cur a elaborata, in hac 
te virum prajiitijii.'* 

During this period, Dillenius held fre- 
quent correfpondence and communication 
with Haller, whom he cfteemed, proba- 
bly the more, on account of the affinity of 
his fyftem with that of Ray, which he had 
himfelf adopted. It appears, that he con- 
fidered Haller as almoft the only man 
qualified to carry on the Pinax, and wifhed 
him to have been his fucceffor. 

About this time, he was employed with 
Dr. Shaw, in reducing to order and afcer- 
taining, that learned traveller's coUedion pf

fiftirig of 640 fpecics, it required the aid of 
an able hand to diflinguifh and apply iyno- 
nyms to fo confiderable a number. This 
catalogue, therefore, which is annexedj witli 
the engravings of a few of the plants, to 
the firlt edition of Dr. Shaw's elaborate 
work, may be conlidered eventually, as the 
work of the botanical Profeflbn 

After the completion of the Hortus EJ^ 
tbamenfisi he parfued his •* Hiftory erf 
" Moflcs " with great diligence. It has 
been obferved before, that he had extended 
his refearchcs into this part of nature^ mdch 
further than any preceding botanifl, having 
been the firft difcoverer of a great number 
of fpecics, and having feparated thofe here-* 
tpfore defcribed together by the general 
term Mufcus^ into fcveral genera^ under the 
names of Sphagnum^ Fontinalis^ Bryum, and 
Hypnum I taking his diftindtions, as well

which, to give himfelf all further opportu-

of this kind ! and which rfiofe who are con- 
verfant ivith thewritings^f Linn:^us can-

The whole impricflion of Dillenius's 
'* Moffes " was only 250 copies, of which 
50 were on imperial paper. The original 
edition having become dxlremely fcarcc*, 
an impreflion of the plates, with the names 
only annexed, was taken off in the year 
1768, arid publiihed by John Millan. I 
here remark, that this was the firft.book 
printed in England^ in which any of the 
Linnaan fpecific charafters were exhibited. 
Both the Flora Lapponica^ and the Hortus 
Cltffortianusy are quoted in this volume. 

• Pofterity will fcarcely believe, that at the time of the 
publication of this work, and during the life of the author, 
the demand for books of natural hittory was fo fmall in 
England^ that one guinea was drought a fufficient price 
for this book. At this period, ten is not, deemed too 
^uch ; and, not long fince, a copy, with the plates co- 
loored by DiLLfeNius himfel^ was fold for twenty gui- 
neas, or tipwards.

There is little doubt that Dillenius 
intended to have profecuted the Fungujfes^ as 
he had done the Afojes^ and he appears to 
have had this defign in contemplation early 
after he came to England. In a letter, 
written in Dec. 1726, he informs his cor- 
refpondent, that " He wasbufy in painting 
^* Pungi^' and makes this employment an 
apology for not arifwering his letters in due 
time. We know that he corfefponded with 
Dr. Deering on this- fubjedt ;' who was 
himfelf well Ikilled in . the kraowkdge of 
thefe produftionSjs and had painted a great 
number, fbme of which he communicated 
to the Profcffor* 

I have been informed, that Dr. Dille- 
nius was of a corpulent habit of body : 
this circumftance, united to his clofe appli- 
cation to ftudy, probably tended to (hortcn 
his days. He was feized with an apoplexy 
in the laft week of March, 1 747 5 and died 
on the 2d of April, in the 60th year of his 
age.

♦ The drawings, ^ricd plants, printed boG||!cs and ma-

his habits were of the reclufe kind. If it 
be allowable to form any opinions of men 
from the perufal of their letters, fomc that 
I have feen, written by him, would fug^ 
geft, that he was naturally endowed with 
a placid difpofition, improved by a philo- 
fophical calmnefs of mind, which fecured 
him in a confiderable degree from the ef^ 
fed:s of the incidental evils of life. I will 
at leaft lay before the reader, in the note"*,

circumftances relating to hint, than that he 
was educated a jphyfician^ and lived at North 
Bierly^ in Yorkjhire. There he refided upon 
liis.ownieftate, which was ample enough to 
fender the pradkice of phyfic totally unne- 
ccflary to his well-beings from any lucra- 
tive views. He had travelled into various 
parts of Englandy for the inveftigation of 
plants, and had been fuccefsful in his tour 
into Walesy having more cfpecially made 
difcoveries in the Cryptogamia clafs. His 
garden was well ftored with exotics, and 
with a curious colledion of Englijh plants. 
He was happily fituated to favour his pof- 
fcffion of the latter, with which his ftore 
was rcplenifhed from time to time by the

I reluiflantly pafs over the na^mes of many

fcrviccs, although they were not writers on

Samuel Brewer, his connexion with DiLr 
LENius will not allow me to refufe a pro- 
per tribute to his memory; fmce his paffion

Jisy for the plants of Mendip and Cbedder

He was . ^originally of Trowbridge, in 
Wiks, in which county he had a fmall 
cftate. He was engaged at one time in the 
woollen manufadory of that place j but, I 
believe, proved iinfuccefsful in bufineis/ 
He' attended Dillenius into Wales ^ An-^ 
glefeyy and the Ijle of Man, in the fummer 
of 1726; and afterwards remained the win- 
ter, and the greater part of the next year, 
in that country; making his refidence at 
Bangor, and taking his excurfions to Snow-' 
don and elfcwhere, often accompanied by 
the Rev. Mr. Green, and Mr. William 
Jones. While in Wales, it was intended 
that he fhould have gone over to Ireland^ 
to make a botanical tQur through that 
kingdom; but that expedition never took 
place. So long a refidence gave him an op- 
portunity not only of feeing the beauties of 
fummer plants, but of collefting the Cryp- 
togamia in winter, when they flourifti moft. 
Here he received inftruftions from tlie Pro-

talogue of more than two hundred plants^ 
many of which were ill afcertained before, 
all fent at one time^ with the references to 
the Synopjis afiixed by Dillenius. This 
journey appears to have been deiigned to 
promote the ^* Appendix to the Syriopfo.** 

In 1728, Mr. JBrewer went into Tork^ 
Jhire, and refided^ I believe, the remainder 
of his days at Bradford^ ill that county, in 
the neighbourhood of Dr. Richardson, 
by whofe beneficence he was affifted in 
various ways. After his retirement into 
Torkjloire^ he meditated, and nearly finiflied, 
a work which was to have borne the title of 
" The Botanical Guide ;" but it never ap- 
peared. I cannot determine the time of 
his deceafe^ but am afTured he was living ia 
the year 1742.

infpcded it ia the year 1762, that it con- 
tained^ at. that time, near 4000 fpecimcns, 
injpludiug both exotic and indigenous plants. 
Among the latter, the Ftlices were the 
jnoft complete part ; the other Cryptogamia 
bfeing but few, and the coUeftion in general 
not rich in Britijh fpecies. In order to 
accommodate the fpecimens to the largcfi: 
fized paper, luxuriant plants of the fmallei; 
kinds had been chofen; a circumftanoc 
difadvantageous to the diftindions of fuch

COLE. 

Mr. Thomas Cole, another of the corre- 
fpondents of DiLLENius, was a diflenting 
minifter at Gloucejier^ of whom \ have heard 
the following anecdote : That he had col-

jreligious :itdl, and repentance, at having 
roifpent his time in accumalating, he com- 
mitted to the flames. Mr. Cots certainly 
forgot, at that moment, that the key to 
ufeful fcience is the knowledge of things. 
To colledt the produdtions of nature, in 
order to admire and contemplate in his 
works the great Author of all, is in itfelf 
fiirely not only innocent, hut laudable; and^ 
, when the view is extended to the utility of 
man, ftill more meritorious. If the fight 
of Mr. Cole's colleftio'n might teach but 
one pealant'todiftinguifli that plant, which 
could alleviate his own, or the afflidtion of 
his neighbour, or his friend, furely it had 
^ot been made in vain.

not been in my power, till this late period, 
to introduce to the reader's notice, any pro* 
feffed work on the Flora of that kingdom. 
The diftradted ftate of the country, during 
a great 'part of the laft century, had doubt- 
lefs no fmall fhafe in retarding the progrefs 
of learning and fcience among the. /r^. It 
does not appear, that, until the middle of 
that period, any enquiries had been made

in general.

the fecond part of the work, in which the 
author intended to have given the Vegeta- 
bles, was never publiflied j if indeed it was 
ever written* 

There is a Mr. Zanche Silhard, an 
apothecary of Dublin^ mentioned by Par- 
kinson, who feems to have poffefled fome 
botanical knowledge. But the earlieft in- 
telligence that I can find of any real bota- 
nift, a native oilrelandy is of a Mr. Hea-^ 
TON, a divine, who lived at Dublin. \ 
cannot colle<5t any anecdotes of him ; but 
I find his name attached, as the firft difco- 
vercr, to many plants in How's Phytologia, 
and to fome in Merrett's Pmax; and, 
from the number and rarity of the fubjefts 
recorded, he muft have been a perfon of 
coniiderable knowledge in his way. It 
appears from the fame authorities, that he 
had been much in England, having pointed 
cut the natural places of many rare plaoyts 

of 



Irijh Botany, i^g 

©f this country. He is thought to have 
left a manufcript on the fubjett, which it 
is conjeftured was written about the year 
1641, and from which Th.relkeld took 
the Iri/h names of plants^ who fays, they 
were much more copious and exad: than he 
could colled: from any living authority. In 
the number of plants, it greatly exceeds any 
lift we have extant of the old Britijh names^ 
or of thofe in the Erfe tongue^ among the 
Highlanders. 

Towards the latter end of the Century^ 
fome information was received relating to 
the natural hiftofy of Ireland, from the tour 
of Dr. Llhwyd, as recorded in the Philor 
Jopbical TranfaSlions ; and Dr. William She- 
RARD, on bis vifits to ^\t Arthur KAVf^ 
DON, at Moyra, noticed many of the rare 
plants of that region. 

St^n after this time, the eftablifhment of 
the Philofofhical Society at Dublin contri- 
buted to advance, among other fciences^ " 
4[hat of natural hiftory 5 and, of thofe who

Pbilofopbical TranfaSiions. 

Dr. Thomas Molyneux was profeflbr of 
phyfic in the univerfity oi Dublin^ and phy- 
fician to the ftate, and to the army. About 
the beginning of this century, he drew up 
fome account of the fpontaneous vegetables 
oi Ireland', which evidence, that he had 
applied to the ftudy in a fcientific manner. 

He communicated his papers to Dr. 
Threlkeld, who incorporated fome of 
them into the body of his Synopfis^ and 
placed the remainder at the end. Of Dr. 
Threlkeld I now proceed to give fome 
account. 

threlkeld. 

Caleb Threlkeld, the author of the 
firft treatife on the plants of Irelandy was 
born the 31ft of May, 1676, at Keiberg^ 
in the parifh of Kirkojwald^ in Cumberland. 
In the year 1698, he commenced mailer of 
arts in the univerfity of Glq/gow, and fooa 
after fettled at Low Huddlefceugb, near the 
place of his birth, in the charadcr of a 
diiienting minifter. He had acquired a 

taftc 



Tbrelkeld. 197 

tafte for botany and phyfic during his re-* 
iidence at Glafgow ; and continued to make 
a confiderable progrefs in thefe ftudies, in- 
fomuch, that, in 171 2, he took a doctor's 
degree in phyfic at Edinburgh ^ and the 
next fpring, having a ftraight income, and 
a large family, he removed to Dublin^ and 
fettled there in the united character of the 
,divine, and phyfician^ Finding himfelf like* 
ly to fucceed, in little more than a year, he 
fent for his family, confifting of a wife, 
three fons, and three daughters. His prac- 
tice as a phyfician, foon increafed, fo far a3 
to enable him to drop his other charafter 
entirely, and devote himfelf wholly to phy^ 
fie. In 1727, he publifhed his ** Synopsis 
Stirpium Hibernicarum j" and died, 
after a fliort ficknefs, of a violent fever, at 
his houfe in Mark's Alley ^ Frances Street, 
April 28, 1728 ; and was buried in the new 
burial ground belonging to St. Patrick's, 
near Cavan Street ; to which place his obs? 
fequies were attended by a fet of children, 
educated by a fociety of gentlemen, to which 
inftitution he had afted as phyfician. And 
my meaiorialift adds, that he was much re-

publifhqd any other work than the follow-^

of plants :

He has moreover interfperfed fome curi-

terms, and from his own experience, of

from Dr. Vaughan a cafe of the fatal ef- 
fe(ft of the Mackenbay, or Euphorbia Hy-

AT the dawn of learning, the feeds of 
botany had been firft fown in Eng^ 
/and, by Dr. Turner, at Cambridge. They 
can fcarcely, however, be faid to have ger- 
minated, until a century afterwards, under 
the foftering care of Mr. Ray. By his 
cultivation, they took root, although not 
invigorated by public fupport. In the mean 
time, through the munificence of the Earl 
of Dan BY, Oxford experienced the benefit 
of a public inftitution in aid of this fcience,. 
and botany flourifhed under the care of Mo-

the fame languor prevailed after the time of 
Mr. Ray ztCamiridge, and botany attained 
no ftrength till the time of Dr. Martyn, 
who, under the patronage of the univerfity, 
gave the firfl: public ledlure in that depart- 
ment, in the year 1727* 

Of this learned botanift, I am now, in 
the order of time, to prefent the readc^r with 
fome account : and here I find myfelf agree- 
ably anticipated by the relation of his life 
and writings, prefixed to his ** Diflertations

fon, and fucceflbr in the profeflbrlhip ; with 
whofe friendfliip and correfpondence, I have 
on this occafion a fincere pleafure in ac- 
knowledging, I have long been honoured. 
Hence I fhall briefly recite from thefe anec- 
dotes, only the leading circumftances in tht 
iifeof Dr. Martyn, as connected with his 
profefTorial chara<5ler ; and Conclude with a

yobn Martyn was born in the city of 
London, Sept. 12, 1699, and was defigncd 
by his father for the profeffion of a mer-i^ 
chant ; but his early and ftrong propenfity 
to learning and fcicncc, in the end over-ruled 
that defign. He had from his youth an 
attachment to botany; and this tafte was 
further excited by his acquaintance with 
Mr. WiLMER, afterwards demonftrator at 
Chelfea Garden ; and confirmed by an inti-* 
macy with, and the countenance of. Dr. 
Sherard, in the year 1719. In the year 
1720, he tranflated from the French, Dr. 
Tournefort's " Hiftory of the Plants 
** growing about Farts ;" and having pro- 
jedled a like catalogue of the plants about 
London^ he coUefted, with unwearied dili- 
gence, the native plants of the environs^; 
making for this purpofe fometimes very ex- 
tcnfive excurfions, and almoft ever on foot* 
He had once conceived a fcheme for form- 
ing a method from the Seed-leaves, and had 
fowna great number of feeds in ordci* to 
obferve the difference between them. He 
early became acquainted with Dillenius, 
and co-operated with him, in forming a fo-** 

ciety 



20S CHAPTER 43. 

cktyof botanifts, which confiftcd of feven* 
tccn members. This fociety kept together 
till the year 1 726. He continued, during the 
years 1723 and 1724, to make his excur- 
fions in fearch of plants more frequent, and 
extended them farther, into Middlefexj Sur^ 
reyy EJfex, and Kent. At the fame time he 
ftudied Infefts, continued his obfervations 
on the Seed-leaves, and made many others 
on the Sexes of Plants. He had, feveral 
years before this time, tranflated from the 
LatiUy an ode on that fubje<ft, prcfented to 
Camerarius, and printed in that Author's 
epiftle De Sexu Plantarum. The tranflation 
may be feen in Blair's *' Botanic Eflays.'* 

In the fummer of 1724, he travelled into 
WaleSf by Bath and Brijioly returning by 
Hereford^ Worcejier^ and Oxford ^y by which 
he extended the objeds of his ftudies, and 
augmented his colled;ion oiEnglijh plants; 
infomuch, that at length it comprehended 
JI400 fpecimcns. "^ 

In 1725 and 1726, he read ledures in 
botany in London^ and was recommended 
by Dr. Sherard and Sir Hans Sloanb 
to exercife the fame fundion at Cambridge i 

where. 



MariyU. ^09 

t^liere, on the death of Br adleYj he was 
chofen ProfefTor of Botany; and continued 
to give ledures for feveral years, until the 
want of a garden, and his long abfence 
from the bufinefs of phyfic, which he had 
engaged in> rendered it incommodious to 
him. 

In 1727, Dr. JVfARTVN was admitted a 
member of the Royal Society ^ and wa§ fa 
active in the committee for regulating the 
library and mufeum, in 173 li that he had 
his bond for annual payment cancelled by 
an order of council^ as an acknowledgment 
6f his fervices. 

In 1730, he was admitted of Bmanuel 
College, with an intention to have pro- 
ceeded regularly with the degrees in phyfic^ 
but his marriage, and his attention to the 
|>radice of the profeffion, preveritedf him 
from finifhing his defign. In the mean 
time, he read ledures in Botany and the' 
Materia Medica^ both at Cambridge and in 
London f in theyqars ij'^^^ and 1731^ tii 
the beginning of the year 1733, he was 
cle£ted Profeflbr of Botany by the unani- 
mous voice of the univerfity.

Dr, Martyn had pradifcd phyfic for 
three years in the city, bat on account of an 
afthmatic complaint, removed in the year 
1730 to Cbelfea\ where he continued the 
^xercife of that profefllon, until his retire- 
ment to Streatham^ in 1752* In 1 761, he 
rcfigned his profefforfliip; and foon after, in 
gratitude for the favour of having chofen 
him, and his fon after him, to this poft, he 
prcfcnted to the univerfity his botanical li- 
brary, confifting of upwards of 200 vo- 
lumes ; his Hortus Siccus of Exotics^ con- 
taining 2600 fpecimens; near 250 drawings 
of Fungi I his coUedtion of Seeds, and Seed 
Veflels ; and his Materia Medica. 

He removed to Chelfea about a year be- 
fore his death 5 which event took place on 
the 29th of January, 1768. 

The Profeflbr was the author of the fol- 
lowing publications :

to the Royal Society, and was defigned to

cafipned the removal of it, in the Flora An^

It is not without the ftrifteft juftice that 
the term indefatigable is applied to this 
learned nian. His avocations from bufinefs 
were wholly devoted to the caufe of litera- 
ture, which he contributed to fcrvc in va- 
rious ways. The nuftierous works he was 
engaged in, and the variety of his manufcript 
remains, amply teftify this truth. At one 
time he was concerned in a periodical pa- 
per. He was a coadjutor with Mr.EAMEs,

He tranflatcd Boerhaave's ^^ Treatife on

and, jointly with Mr. Chambers, gave, in

to appropriate the • modem appellations, 
with a degree of judgment, that has been 
highly approved of by thofe who know the 
difficulty of the undertaking, under that 
almoft total want of fpecific diftindlion, 
which occurs in the writings of the an* 
cients. 

In the year 1 7 37, our Author entered 
into correfpondence with Linn-^eus, It 
is one of thofe notices that can only oc-r 
cur to a lover of fimilar ftudies, that he 
was, if npt th^ firft, at Jeaft one of the 
carlieft Englijh writers, who announced 
the northern genius to the BritiJIo reader. 
This was done by the Profeflbr*s extraft 
from the Flora Lapponica^ printed in the 
edition of the Georgics in 1741. It was 
fome years afterwards, before the fyftem of 
the Swede made any progrefs in England. 

I ihall only remark further, that befides 
the pbligations which literature in general 
owes to this learned ProfeiTor, that which 
I call more ftridtly Englijh botany, received

ALTHOUGH the ingenious author, 
whom I commemorate in this chap«. 
ter, does not ftridly rank among the im-- 
provers of indigenous botany ; yet I cannot 
pafs over in filence, a man, to whom the 
fciencc owes one of its moft elegant, and 
fuperb productions. Mr. Mark Catesby 
was, I believe, one of thofe men, whom a 
paffion for natural hiftory very early al- 
lured from the interefting purfuits of life; 
and it led him at length to crofs the Atlan^ 
tic^ that he might read the volume of na- 
ture in a country but impcrfcaiy explored* 
;tnd where her beauties were difplaycd in a 

more 



220 CHAPTER 44, 

more extended and magnificent fcale, than 
the narrow bounds of his native country 
exhibited. It is but too true, that the world 
at large will for ever treat with ridicule and 
diiHain that man, who, thus deferting the 
paths that lead to riches, to preferment, 
or. to honour, gives himfelf up to what arc 
commonly deemed unimportant and trifling 
occupations* Few will give him credit for 
that fecrec fitisfadion, for that inexhaufti- 
blc pleafure, which the inveftigation of na- 
ture, in all her objects, inceflantly holds 
forth to his mind; or believe, that fuch 
employment can poflibly compcnfate for the 
folid treafurcs of gain. 

Mark Catesby was born about the lat- 
ter end of 1 679, or the beginning of the 
next year. He acquaints us himfelf, that 
he had very early a propenfity to the ftudy 
of nature ; and that his wifh for higher 
gratifications in this way, firft led him to 
London^ which he emphatically ftiles ^* the 
center of fcience;" and after w^ards impelled 
him to feek further fources, in diftant parts 
of the globe. The rcfidence of fume re- 
lations 



Catejby. > 221 

lations in Virginia favoured his dcfigh ; and 
he went to that country in 1712, where he 
ftaid fcven years, admiring, and colleding 
the various produdions of the country, 
without having laid any diredt plan for the 
work he afterwards accompli (hed. During 
this refidence, he communicated feeds and 
ipecimens of plants, both dried, and in a 
growing ftate, to Mr, Dale, of Braintree^ 
in Efex ; and, fome of his obfervations on 
the country, being communicated by this 
means to Dr. William Sherard, procured 
him the friendfhip and patronage of that 
gentleman. On his return to Englandy in 
1 71 9, he was encouraged by the affiflancc 
of feveral of the nobility, of Sir Hans 
SI.OANE, Dr. Sherard, and other natu- 
ralilis, whofe names he has recorded, to 
return to America^ with the profcffcd dc- 
fign of defcribing, delineating, and painting 
the more curious objeds of nature. Caro^ 
Una was fixed on, as the place of his refi- 
dence, where he arrived in May i722» He 
firft examined the lower parts of the coun- 
try, making excurfioxis from CbarlesTowtfi 

and 



222 CHAPTER 44* 

and, afterwards fojourned, for iome time, &«• 
mong the Indians in the mountainous regioas 
at and about Fort Moore. He then extend- 
ed his refearches through Georgia and F^- 
rida; and having fpent nearly three years 
on the continent, he vifited the Bahama 
Ijlands^ taking his refidence in the IJU of 
Providence ; carrying on his plan, and par- 
ticularly making colle(5tions of fifhes, and 
fubmarine productions. 

On his return to England, in the year 
1726, his labours having met with the ap- 
probation of his patrons, Mr. Catesby 
made himfelf mafter of the art of Etching; 
and, retiring to Hoxton, employed himfelf 
in carrying on his great work, which he 
publifhed in numbers of twenty plants each.

|he frequent mention of the name of Dr. 
JVilliam Houston ; and that the exotic 
botany of England was greatly enriched by 
his means. If I err not, Mr. Houston 
went firft to the TFeJl Indies^ in the charac- 
ter of a furgeon ; and, upon his return, after 
two years refidence at Leyden^ took degrees 
in phyfic under Boerhaave, This was 
in 1728 and 1729. At L^j/^/if;/, he inftitu-

of which proved, contrary to the common- 
ly received opinion, that animals could live 
and breathe for fome time, although air 
was freely admitted into both cavities of the

It appears that he was cledted a Fellovv 
of the Royal Society foon after his return 
from Holland', and that he went immedi-, 
ateiy to the Weji Indies. I am not able to 
afcertain his fixed refidence in that part of 
the world, although I conjedture, it wat, 
principally at the Logwood Settlement ; from 
whence he fent a defcription and figure of 
the Dorjienia Contrayerva, which were pub-

THE increafing cultivation of exotics 
in England^ from the beginning of the 
prefejjj; century, and the greater difFufion of 
tafte for the elegancies and luxuries of the 
Stove and Green-houfe, naturally tended to 
raiie up a fpirit of improvement and real 
fcience in the arts of culture. To preferve 
far-fetched rarities, it becan^e necclTary to 
fcrutinize into the true principles of the 
art, which ultimately muft depend on the 

knowledge

knowledge of the climate of each plant, 
and the foil in which it flourifhes, in that 
climate. 

Under the influence of fuch men as 
Sloane^ the Sherards^ and other opu- 
lent encouragers of the fcience, gardeners 
acquired botanical knowledge, aiid were 
excited to greater exertions in their art. 
Hence, I believe, the Englijb gardeners have 
fliewn themfelves equal, if not fuperior, to 
moft others. My plan does not allow me 
to deviate fo far, as to cite authors on the 
fubjeft of gardening, unlefs eminent for their 
acquaintance with Englijh botany. Some 
have diftinguifhed themfelves in this way; 
and i cannot omit to mention with applaufe, 
the names of Fairchild, Knowlton, 
Cordon, and Miller. The firft of 
thefe made himfelf known to the Royal 
Society, by fome " New Experiments rc- 
" lating to the diflferent, and Ibmetimes

Thomas Knowlton was, in the earlier 
part of his life, gardener to Conful She-* 
RARDs but I find him in that ftation at 
Lone/borough y m Torkjhire^ in the fervicc of 
the Earl of Burlington, in the year 

1728 y in which place, I believe, he fpent 
the greater part, if not the whole, of the 
remainder of his life. His zeal for Englijh 
botany was uncommonly great, and recom- 
mended him fuccefsfuUy to the learned bo- 
tanifts of this country. From Sir Ham 
Sloane, he received eminent civilities. He 
merits notice in thefe memoirs, were it 
only to record his difcovery of that Angu- 
lar production, the Globe Conferva^ or Moor 
Balls (Conferva /Egagropila Lin,) ; which 
he firft found in Wallingfen Mere. I have 
read a letter from him to a correfpondent, 
written in the year 1728 ; and another in 

1729 : in one of which he relates his hav- 
ing waded near a quarter of a mile into the 
lake to coUeft them ; which is not done 

without

without fome difficulty, as they lie at the

other time he was more fucccfsful, and col-^ 
leded near a bufliel at once. He defcribes 
theoi to his friend, under the name ot Pi/^ 
ias, or globular Balls of Mofs, of the fize of 
a tennis ball. 

Mr. Thomas Knovvlton was a man of

Philip Miller was born m the year

eminence, but rarely if ever before equalled^ 
in the charader of a gardener. It is not 
uncommon to give the term of BotsLniR, 
to any man that can recite by memory, the 
plants of his garden. Mr. Miller rofe 
much above this attainment. He added 
to the knowledge of the theory and pradlicc 
of gardening, that of the ftrudture and cha- 
racters of plants, and was early and pradli- 
cally verfed in the methods of Ray and 
TouRNEFORT. Habituated to the ufe of 
thefe, from his younger years, it was not 
without reludlance that he was brought to 
adopt the fyftcm ofLiNNiEus; but he was 
convinced, at length, by the arguments of 
the late Sir JVilliam Watson and Mr*

In 173 1, he publifhed his " Gardener's 
** Didionary," in folio, which has pafled 
through many Aicceflive editions 5 in each 
of which it received fuch improvements, 
and augmentations, as have rendered it in 
the end the moft complete body of garden- 
ing extant. It has been tranflated into va- 
rious languages ; and the reception it has 
every where met with, is a fufficient proof 
of its fuperiority. The new edition of it, 
now under the care of ProfelTor Martyn, 
we doubt not, will extend to 1 late period, 
the reputation both of the author, and of 
the editor. 

In the fame, or the fucceeding year, he 
publilhcd '' The Gardener's Kalender," in 8^5

which has run through numerous cdi«

for the whole kingdom. To an edition of 
this work, in 1761, the author prefi^ced 
^* A Short Introduftion to the Knowledge 
** of the Science of Botany ;" in which he 
explains the Linnaan terms of art, and il- 
luflrates the charafters of the clafles in five 
copper-plates. This introduction was alio

Mr. Miller held an extenfive corre- 
ipondence with perfons in diftant parts of 
the globe. From the Cape of Good Hope^ 
from Siberia^ from North America, and par- 
ticularly, by means of Dr. William Hous- 
ton, from the Weji Indies, his garden, for 
a long feries of years, received a plentiful and- 
perpetual fupply of rare, and frequently of 
new fpecies, which his fuccefsful culture fel- 
dom failed to preferve. It was the remark 
of foreigners, that Cbelfea exhibited the trca- 
fures of both the Indies. Thefe advantages 
enabled Miller to execute, what it was 
in the power of few to attempt — ^His

numbers in 1755, and which were com- 
plcted in 300 tables, making two volumes 
in folio, in 1760, were drawn from plants 
of his own garden. His original defign 
was very extenfive ; no lefs than to give 
one, or more fpecies, of all the genera : but 
it was found to be impracticable; and it 
was therefore confined to fuch as were the 
moft beautiful, ufeful, and uncommon. 
Each number was accompanied with feve- 
ral pages of letter-prefs, containing the 
defcriptions, and an. account of the clafles 
to which they belong, according to the fyf- 
tems of Ray, Tournefort, and Lin- 
N-ffius. As this work is well known, I fliall 
only obferve, that whether we confider the 
rarity of the fubjed:s, the fpecioufnefs of ^ 
thofe he feleded for his purpofe, or the ge- 
neral execution of the whole, England had 
not before produced any work, except the 
Hortus Elthamenjis^ and Catesby's Caro-^ 
Una, fo fuperb and extenfive. In one re- 
fped:. Miller's plates had the advantage 
of the above mentioned, as they exhibited, 
much more frequently, the feparate figures 
of the parts of frudtification.

merit, and the fate of her unfortunate huf- 
band, who, condemned for crimes of ftate, 
fufFered death on the fcaffold in Sweden, in 
the year 1747. 

We are informed, (he was the daughter 
of a merchant in the neighbourhood of 
Aberdeen*, of which city Dr. Alexander 
Bi^ACKWELL, her hufband, was a nativci 
and where he received an univerfity educa- 
tion, and was early diftinguifhed for his 
claffical knowledge. By fome, he is faid 
only to have aflumed the titl? of Do<9:or, 
after his fuccefsful attendance on the King 
of Sweden ; but I believe, the more proba- 
ble account is, that of his having taken 
the degree of Dodlorof Phyfic under Boer- 
HAAVE at Leyden. After having failed in 
his attempt to introduce himfelf into prac- 
tice, lirft in Scotland, and afterwards in 
Londoh, he became correftor to a printing 
prefs, and foon after commenced printer 
himfelf. But being profecuted by the trade, 
and at length involved in debt, was thrown 
into prifon. To relieve thefe diftrefles, Mrs, 
Blackwell, having a genius for drawing 
and painting, exerted all her talents; and, 

under/landing; 



BlackwelL 25 J 

pnderftanding that an Herbal of Medicinal 
Plants was greatly wanted, fhe exhibited 
to Sir Hans Sloane, Dr. Mead, and 
other phyficians, feme fpecimens of her 
art in painting plants, who approved fo 
highly of them, as to encourage her to pro- 
fecute a work, by the profits of which flie 
is faid to have procured her hufband's li- 
berty, after a confinement of two years. 

Mr. Rand, an eminent apothecary, wa»^ 
at that time Demonftrator to the Company 
of Apothecaries, in the Garden at Chelfea. 
By his advice fhe took up her refidence op- 
pofite the Phyfic Garden, in order to faci- 
litate her defign, by receiving the plants as 
frefh as poffible. He not only promoted 
her work with the public, but, together . 
with Mr. Philip Miller, afforded her all 
poffible diredlion and affiftance in the exe- 
cution of it. After fhe had completed the 
drawings, fhe engraved them on copper, 
and coloured the prints with h^r own 
hands. 

During her abode at Chelfea^ fhe was fre- 
quently vifited by perfons of quality, and 
many fcientific people, who admired her 

performances.

performances, and patronized her under* 
taking. 

On publifliing the firft volume, in 1737, 
fhe obtained a recornmendation from Dr. 
Mead, Dr. Sherard, Mr. Rand, and 
others, to be prefixed to it. And being 
allowed to prefent, in perfon, a copy to the 
College of Phyficians, that body made her 
a prefent, and gave her a public tcftimonial 
of their, approbation ; with leave to. prefix 
it to her book. The fccond volume was 
finifhed in 1739* and the whole publifhed 
under the following title ;

yet, upon the whole, the figures are fuffi^ 
ciently diflindtive of the fubjed:. 

Each plate is accompanied with an en- 
graved page, containing the Latin and Eng^ 
lijh officinal names, followed by a fhort 
defcriptioa of the plant, and a fummary of 
its qualities, and ufes*. After thefe occur 
the name in various other languages, Thefe 
illuftrations were the (hare her hufband took 
in the work; This ill-fated man, after his 
failure in phyfic, and in printing, became 
an unfuccefsful candidate for the place of 
Secretary to the Society for the Encourage- 
ment of Learning* He was made Super- 
intendant of the Works belonging to the 
Duke ^Chandos at Cannons y and experi- 
enced thofe difappointments incident to 
projeftors. He formed fchemcs in agricul- 
ture, and wrote a treatife on the fubjeft, 
which, we are told, was the caufe of his 
being engaged in Sweden. In that king- 
dom, he drained marflies, praftifed phyfic^ 
and, was even employed in that capacity for 
the king. At length he was involved: m 
ibrne ft4te cabals, or, as fomc accounts have 
\\y in a plot with Count Te ssjn, for which 

he

he loft his life, protefting his innocence td 
the laft. 

So refpedtable a performance as Mrs. 
Blackwell's, attraifted the attention of 
phyficians on the continent. Trew, of 
Norimierg, in the year 1750, engaged an 
artift of that place to copy Mrs. Black- 
well's plates, and himfclf fupplied fevcral 
defeds in the drawings. HeTubftituted fome 
entirely new figures in the room of the ori- 
ginals, very confiderably reformed and am- 
plified the text, tranflated it into German 
and Latiriy and planned the addition of a 
lixth century of plates- He prefixed a moft 
elaborate and learned Catalogue of Botani- 
cal Authors, but did not live to finifli the 
work. The Fifth Century was publifhed 
in 1765 ; and Dp. Trew dying in 1769, 
jhe fupplemental volume, exhibiting plants 
omitted by Mrs. Blackwell, articles 
jiewly introduced into pradiice, and figures 
of the poifonous fpecies, was condudtcd 
by LuDWiG, BosE, and Boehmer, and 
printed in 1773. Thus reformed, Trew's 
edition furpafles any other work of the fame

occurs a lift of fbme plants, difcovered hy 
the author after the publication of this

Cryptogamous kind. Several of the more 
rare plants of the environs efcaped the ob- 
iervation of this afliduous man ; among 
>vhich may be mentioned particularly, that 
moft virulent of all our Englijh produc- 
tions, the Cicuta virofa^ or, long-leavcd 
Water Hemlock; which I remember to 
have fecn growing in the Leen^ near the 
Rock' holes , in Nottingham Park. That 
the Addenda to his *' Catalogue " were not 
more copious may be attributed to his 
fubfequent misfortunes, which undoubtedly 
damped the ardour of his purfuit. 

Notwithftanding his early fuccefs, that 
** adverfe fatality," which he himfelf alludes 
to in his " Letter on the Small-pox," flill 
attended him. He was, unhappily, not en* 
dowcd with that degree of prudence, and e- 
quanimity of temper, which are to neceflary 
to the pradtice of phyfic i infomuch, that 
he very early loft the little intereft which

But a^s I would rather dwell on fais merits, 
than on his failings, I fhall obfervc, that be- 
fides his acquaintance with the anticnt lan- 
guages, he was mafter of many of the mo- 
dern tongues. His knowledge of that fci« 
ence which gives him a place in this iketch^ 
was very confiderable, and will be perpetu- 
ated, ib long as Dillenius*s ** Hiftory" 
(hall preferve eftimation. He had a know- 
ledge of deffigning, and was an ingenious 
mechanic. After his failure in Phyfic, his 
friends attempted feveral fchemes to alleviate 
his neccffitics. They procured him, among 
others, a commiflion in the regiment raifed 
at Nottingham^ on account of the rebellion. 
But this proved more honourable than 
profitable to him. He was afterwards em- 
ployed in a way more agreeable to his ge- 
nius, and talents ^ being furnifhed with ma- 
terials, and enabled by the afliftance oijobn 
Plumtree, Efq; and others, to write the 
Hiftory oi Nottingham, which he dedicated 
to the Duke of Newcastle. But he did 
not live to receive the reward of this la- 
tour. He had been troubled with the gout 
at a very early period, having been afflided

degree of poverty, and depcndance, which 
his fpirit could not fuftain, oppreifcd with 
calamity, and complicated difeafe^ he died 
April 12, 1749. Two of his principal cre-

The fubjea of this article, like Tbo^ 
mas WiLLisEL, and Samuel Brewer, is 
another inftance of that unconquerable 2Lt^ 
tachment to a favourite branch of know-» 
ledge, which fometimes engrofles the minds 
of thofe, who, by their lot, have not been 
exempted from labouring in the lower, and 
mechanical offices of life. 

From information which I received, more 
than twenty years ago, concerning John 
Wilson, I learned that he was originally 
an inhabitant of Kendal, in Wejimoreland i 
and was employed in the manufacture of 
knit ftockings, for which that town was fo 
famous. That^ at one time, he gave weekly 

lefTons 



Wilfon. 265 

kffon^ on botany, alternately, at that placcj> 
and at Newcajile. That many pupils re- 
fortcd to him from the neighbouring parts 
of Scotland I infomuch, that in fome f<ia-. 
fons, he received fixty pounds a year, as thq 
premium of his labours^ 

I muft not, however, omit to obfervc, 
that this account does not coincide with 
another, which I have fince met with m 
the ^* Britijh Topography;" the refpeftablc 
author of which informs us, ^* That Wij,-- 
*^ SON was a ihoemaker, and by his intenfe 
^* application to his favourite ftudy, lived 
^* moft of his life in a itate of indigence, 
^* A cow, of which his wife had the care, 
** was the fole fupport of his family ? and 
*' fuch was his infatuation, that he was 
** once tempted to part with that moft ufe-* 
^' ful animal, to purqhafe Mori son's vo- 
^' luminous work, had not a neighbouring 
^^ lady prefentcd him with the book, and 
^* refcued the poor man and his family from 
<* beggary and ruin/' 

In this reprefentation of Wjxson^s con- 
<Juft, while men of fympathizing minds, 

and 



266 CHAPTER 47* 

and fimil^r tafte, muft deplore that hard 
fate which reduced him to fuch ncceffity, 
they muft yet more ftrongly cenfurc a rafli- 
nef$9 which could tempt him to rifk^ in fo 
c^ential a manner, the welfare of his fe. 
mily. 

As Wilson exhibited to the public, a 
lingular proof of his knowledge in this hi^ 
principal object, I am inclined to believe, 
that he muft, originally, either have had 
fome grammar education, or, impelled by 
his genius, muft afterwards have acquired 
a knowledge of the Laiin language. How 
clfe (except on the fuppofition of extraordi- 
nary afliftance, of which I have no informa- 
tion) could he have made ufc of Mori son's 
^' Hiftory," or have tranfla ted. Ray's Sj- 
nqpjis ! In 1744, he publi/hed ** A Sy- 
" Nopsis OF British Plants in Mr. 
" Ray's Method ; with their Charadjcrs, 
" Defcriptions, Places of Growth, Time of 
** Flowering, and phyfical Virtues, accord- 
*' ing to the moft accurate Obfervations,

Throughout this work, the author ha? 
prefixed copious chara<fters to each genus, 
taken, as it appears, from Ray and Tour ne^ 
FORT • into many of which, in conformity 
to Ray's method, he introduces the form 
of the leaves, gnd the habit of the plant. 
By this means, having added, in moft in-^ 
ftances, fhort defcriptions of the fpecies, his 
book was an ufeful pocket manual, as far 
as it extended; for he begins with the Ca-. 
pillary plants, and ends with the Bulbous 
rooted. He fubjoins the particular places 
of the rare plants in the. northern parts of- 
Rnglandy from his own obiervations, and, 
partly from a manufcript of Mr. Law-#. 
son's.. His remarks on the properties and 
virtues, additional to thofe from Ray, he 
has principally extracted from Miller'§\ 
^' Botanicum Officinale J* 
* Wilson has made fome tranfpofitions in 
the diflribution of his fubjeds in this vo- 
lume, which prove that he. had attentively 
examined plants, and was well acquainted

with the fyftem of Ray. Some of his al- 
terations will ftand the tcft of modern accu- 
racy, though otlicrs may be lefs happy* 

He has placed all the fpecics of the Fu^ 
maria genus together, in the Papilionaceous . 
clafs; and, agreeably to the hint which 
DiLLENius gives in iht Synopjis, p. 316, 
has referred the Plantains^ and Sponges^ to 
the Monopetalous flowers fuccecded by dry 
feed veflels. The removal of the Lyjima^ 
cbuffiliquofa^ the two Papavera corniculata^ 
^^Cbelidonium, and the Balfamine^ to the/S/- 
//^i^3/?orTetradynamous clafs of Linn-sus, 
is lefs to be approved. By thefe changes, 
he has nearly annihilated Ray*s twenty- 
fecond clafs of Britijh herbs. In tranf- 
pofing of fpecics, he has made more nume-» 
rous alterations ; fome of which are fuffi^ 
ciently juftified by modem improvenients* 
^Thus he has brought under one genus the 
Scordium and Scorodonia. He has referred 
the Rapbanus rujiicanus to the Cochlearia 
genus, as Tournefort had done. The , 
Chelidonium genus is feparated from the 
pMpaver^ and a new charafteriftic note 
framed, but the name Papaver corniculatum

preferved. The only two plants met \Vlth 
in this book^ which do not occur in the 
Synop^s of Ray, are fuch as have a doubt- 
ful title to the appellation of indigenous : 
they are the Valeriana rubra^ and Allium 
Scbanoprafum. 

I believe he died about the year 1750, 
or loon after. He left the remaining part 
of his work, on the Graminaceous and Cryp-^ 
togamous tribes, compleat in manufcript. 
In the year 1762, a pcrfon oi Newcaftle^ 
into whofe hands the manufcript had 
pafled, meditated the publication of it,

as they hereby contributed to enlarge the

In this volume, Mr. Blackstone haji

laft were obferved by Mr. Blacks tone iji

The author intended another volume of

The ^^ Specimen Botanicum"* of Mr.

publifhed in England^ on the indigenous 
botany^ before the fyftem of Linnjeus had 
gained the afcendancy over that of Ray : 
nor, unlefs it were within my plan to re- 
count iingle papers, occafionally printed in 
the Pbilofopbical TranfaBtons, or in other 
collections, am I able to mention any work 
of importance on exotic botany, before this 
revolution took place, which was not built 
upon, or at leafl did not exhibit fome prin* 
ciples of, the new fyftem. Whilft this 
event was taking place, which cannot be 
computed at fewer than twenty years, com- 
mencing from 1740, there were, however, 
feveral eminent and learned men, who, al- 
though they did not diftinguifh themfelves

were occafionally improving it, by their

obftrudts the tranfmiffion of the rays of

AMONG the various contingencies 
which favoured the introduction of 
theLinncvan fyftem into England ^ it is not* 
unimportant to mention the efFed of the , 
atJmirabk pencil of the late Mr, Eh ret. 
This ingenious artift brought with him, 
not only a general tafte for botany, but a 
particular knowledge of the principles, oa 
whicli the fyftem of Linnaeus was found- 
ed 5 and was among the firft who difplaye4 
it, in the fpecimens of his art. 

Th^ father of George Dyonijius Ehret 
was gardener to the Prince of Baden Ihir^ 

lach^ 



hcb'^. Young Ehret very early fliewcd a 
tafte for drawing, and painting the flowers 
of the garden* And although he received 
no inftrudions, yet fuch was his proficien- 
cy, that, whilft a very young man, he had 
painted 500 plants with a fkill and accu- 
racy that was almoft unexampled, under 
the difadvantages of fo total a want of in* 
. ilruiSion as our young artift had experi- 
enced* His merit, however, remained long 
unknown, or at leaft jneiFedually noticed, 
until it was difcovered by a gentleman of 
curiofity and judgment, who vifited the 
garden, of which his father was the fuper-;* 
intendant. Fortunately for young Ehret, 
this ftranger was a phyfician and a friend 
of the celebrated Dr. Trew, of Normierg^ 
to whom he juftly fuppofed thefe paintings 
would be acceptable. E h r e t by this means 
was introduced to Trew, who immediately, 
purchafed the whole 500 paintings, and ge- 
tieroufly gave him double the price at which 
the young artift had modeftly valued them. 

♦ CharleSj Prince of BaderkDurlachy was a patron of 
botany, and his garden was famous at that time. He 
{ent his principal fuperintendant of the garden, on the un* 
fortunate expedition with Hebenstreit, into Jfriciu 

The 



286 CHAPTER 49. 

The liberality of Trew, by which Ehret 
put46oo florins into his pockety infpired him 
with confidence in his own abilities^ and fuch 
a fhare of ambition as inclined him to quit 
his home^ and feek at once to raife his for* 
tune, and to gratify the dclire he bad to fe« 
the world. It appears that hd was too much 
elated with his fuccefs; and^ as the efFedt of 
Ibme fhare of vanity, and a want <rf cbco- 
nomy not unufual in young men, he ibon 
diflipated this fum, and, in queft of adven* 
turcs, went to Bqfil^ with the laft, and tho& 
only a few^ of his florins in his pocket* 
Here, fhutting himfclf up, he, with great 
diligence, and fingular exertion, flimulated 
now by prefBng ncceffity, foon exhibited 
aamerous fpecimens of his art; and, though 
he had learned to fet a higher value upon 
diem, found a demand beyond his induf- 
try to fupply. Having thus recruited his 
finances, he journeyed into France^ and re- 
fided fome time at Montpelier^ where he 
taught his art to a lady of fortune, who re- 
warded him gencroufly, and, on his wifli to 
remove, paid his expences to Lpns and P/^-- 
ris. At the latter city he became known to 
JussiEU, and was for fome time employed 

to 



Ebret. 2$f 

to paint the plants of the Royal Garden^ 
under that eminent Profeflbr's infpe<5tio?i. 
After a certain time, he exchanged his fitu- 
ation at Paris^ for that of London ; bat not 
fucceeding to his mind, he foon returned 
to the continent. The precife time of hi$ 
bein^ firft in England^ I cannot afeeftaifii 
but it was, I conjedture, before his employ- 
ment in the garden of Mr, Clifford, 
where Linn^sus found him in the year 
173^6. From LiNN/Bus himfelf he wa$ 
taught attention to the parts of the flpwcr, 
and hence became early inftrufted ia tli« 
principles of the fexwal fyftem. His go« 
tafte, and botanical accuracy, were, I ap- 
prehend, firft publicly manifefted in the 
figures of the Hortus Cliffortianus^ pub-- 
liihed in 17373 and, from that time, Eh^ 
RET became ftrongly attached to the pria- 
.4iplcs of the Swede. 

He returned to England about the year 
1740, or foon after that period : and here 
he fpent the remainder of his days. His firft 
patron in this country was 7i2y/?r Whjt»^ 
Efq; for whom he finifhed 300 paintings of 
plants. He foon after procured the patro- 
nage of Dr. Mead« for whQm he painted 
.3 200, 



288 C H A P T 15 R 49* 

^oo, and who generoufly advanced his price* 
In confequence of this countenance and 
proteiftion, he obtained encouragement from 
Sir Hans Slo ane, and many other opulent 
lovers of his art. Dfw Fothergill pro- 
cured large colledlions from him; and the 
late eminent patronefs of natural hiilory^ the 
Duchefs g/* Portland, poffeffed, befides 
near 300 paintings of exotics, upwards of 
500 of Englijh plants, done on vellum, and 
highly finifhed, by this admirable artift. 

Another of his patrons, and to whofc 
obliging information I owe great part of the 
foregoing anecdotes relating to him, was 
jR^i^^WiLLETT,Efqi oiMerfyy mDorfet^ 
jhire-, at whofe feat Mr. Eh ret was ac- 
cuftomed, for many years, to fpend feveral 
weeks in the fummer feafon, and in whofe 
friendfhip Mr.EHRET repofed, as executor 
in the laft arrangement of his affairs. The 
library at Merly exhibits a copious collec- 
tion of exotics, done by Ehret : not fewer 
than 230 finifhed fpecimens on vellum; 
befides fcVenty on paper ; and more than 
500 in an unfinifhed ftate.

Watson's obfervations on the fatal Qua- 
lities of thofe Plants. 

Very early after his arrival in this king- 
dom, he began to paint figures of the rareil 
products of the JS/fg/^ gardens, for his friend 
and firft patron Dr. Trewi for whom, in 
the end, he finifhed 300. Of thcfc, at 
different periods, 100 were engraved, and 
publifhed in Decads^ under the following

The only publication of any importance

gaged throughout, as far as I can find, was 
Brown's " Natural Hiftory of Jamaica,'* 
printed in 1756, for which he drew all the 
figures, amounting to 40 tables. As they 
were principally taken from prepared and 
dried fpccimens, they cannot be numbered 
among his capital performances. 

Mr.EHRET drew, and himfelf engraved,

to exhibit on his piece the true charaftcrs,- 
without the fmalleft deviation for the fake 
of embellifhment. Having early imbibed 
the principles of Linnaus's fyftem, he at- 
tended to the difcrinaination of the parts on 
which it was founded, with an accuracy 
that commanded obfervance; and while his' 
excellence in delineating and painting drew 
admiration, and difFufed a taftc for the 
ftudy of plants, the truth of his pencil in- 
ftrudted thofe who beheld it in the prin-f 
ciples of the fcience.

WATSON. 

AMONG thofe learned botanifts of 
England^ who early recognized the 
prevailing excellencies of the Linnaan fyC- 
tern, muft be ranked the late Sir William 
Wat so N, At a period when Botany was 
feebly fupported in thefe kingdoms, after 
the deceafe of the Sherards, and the re- 
tirement of Sloane, his talents and his 
zeal enabled Him, as far as the influence of

2g6 CHAPTER 50. 

an individual could extend, to fuflain an4 
promote this fciencc, not Qnly with his 
own countrymen, but with thofe learn* 
ed foreigners who vifited this kingdom. 
Whilft, therefore, juftice to his charadter 
aod attainments, in the fubje<5b of this 
work, demand confideration, I feel an addi- 
tional motive to pay a tribute to his me- 
mory, arifing from a grateful remembrance 
of the friendship and correfpondeijcc with 
which he honpured me. 

Sir William Watson wa« born in 1715, 
in St. Johns Street ^ near Smitbfield. His fa- 
ther was a reputable tradefman in that ftreet, 
and died, leaving him very young. When 
he had attained to a proper age, he was 
fent to Merchant Taylor's School ; and from 
thenpe was apprenticed to Mr. Ricbardfon^ 
apothecary, in 1730. 

In his ,youth he had a ftrong propenfity 
to the ftudy of patural hiftory, and parti- 
cularly to that of plants. This led him to 
make frequent excurfions in a morning, fe- 
deral miles from London i fo that he becamq 
early well acquainted with the Loci natales 
qf the indigenous plants of the environ? of 

London z 



Watjbn. 297 

Lmdon I and, during his apprentice&ip, he 
gained the honorary premjum given annu* 
ally by the Apothecaries Company, to fuch 
young men a$ exhibit a fuperiority in the 
knowledge of plants, in thofe excurfions 
made by the Demonftrator of Cbelfea Gar- 
den i and inftituted for the purpofe of ini- 
tiating the apprentices of the Company in a 
fcience fo neceflary to the profeffion. This 
premium, as hath been obferved in the 
courfe of the preceding pages, confiftcd of a 
handfomely bound copy of Ray's Synopjis^ 
He continued, a^ times, throughout his life, 
to attend on thefe occafions, and meet his 
former aflbciatcs with great pjeafure and 
delight. 

In 1738, Mr, Watson married, and fet 
up in bufinefs for himfelf. His Jkill, his 
adivity, and diligence in his profeffion, foon 
diftinguifhed him among his acquaintance; 
as did his tafte for natural hiftory, and his 
general knov^^ledge of philofophical fubjeSs 
among the members of the Royal Society^ 
of which honourable body he was cleded a 
member early in the year 1741 ; his two 
firil: communicatipn^ Jbeing printed in the 

41ft 



2gS CHAPTER 50. 

41 ft volume of the Pbilofopbical Tranfac^ 
tions. 

Soon after his admiflion into the Royal 
Society, Mr. Watson diftinguiflied him- 
ielf as a botanift. His earlieft paper on 
this fubjedt was, '* An Account of the ce- 
*' lebrated Haller's Enumeratio Stirpium^ 
" Helvetia^ extra<fted from the Latin^ and 
** illuftrated with a ConfpeBus of the au- 
• *' thor's method, and with various obfer-- 
*' vaticwis/' This was printed in the Pbi^^ 
lojbphical TranfaSiions (a). 

In the fame volume {&), and in the fuc- 
ceeding (c), he excited the attention of the 
curious in this way, by fbme '* Critical Re- 
** marks on the Rev. Mr. Pickering'^ 
•* Paper concerning the Seeds of Mufh- 
*' rooms,'* which, that gentleman having 
feen a fhort time before, considered as a new 
difcovery; whereas Mr. Watson fhewed^ 
that they had been demonftrated feveral 
years prior to that period, by M» Micheli, 
in his " Nova Plant arum Geyiera^'' printed 
at Florence in 1729.

But that which attrafted the attention of 
foreign botaniftjs particularly, was his de- 
fcrlption of a rare and elegant fpecies of 
Fungus J called from its form Geafter {J). 
This was written in Latin, and accompa- 
nied with an engraving. It has fincc been 
f:arlled Ly coper don fornicatum. 

In the fame volume are inferted fome 
very inftrudtive obfervations on the Cicuta^ 
or Common Hemlock ; occafioned by the 
death of two ai t\i^ Dutch foldicrs, quartered 
at Wdltham Abbey, in Ejfex ; which hap* 
pened in confequence of their having eaten 
this herb inftead of Greens (J). 

The death of two of the French prifonera 
in 1746, occafioned by their eating the 
roots of the Hemlock Dropwort, produced 
from Mr. Watson a paper, which in an 
eminent manner exemplified his fkill in the 
knowledge of plants. It abounds with 
curious and critical obfervations on that 
plant, and on the Sium Eruca folio of Caf- 
par Bauhine (Cicuta virofa L/>j.) with 
which it had been frequently confounded ;

In the 45th volume of the Pbilofopbical 
^ranfaSHanSy is printed a Tranfla^tion, by Mr. 
Watson, of a Letter to Sir Hans Sloane, 
from Dr.GARCiN, oi Neucbatel^ containing 
a complete hiftory of the Cyprefs of the an- 
tients 5 the Henna^ or Alcanna of the Ara-- 
Bians, called by Lis liMvsLaw/bnia inermis;

cine, and as a dye, all over the Eaft, info- 
much that, at Conjiantinople^ the duty on 
this drug amounts to 18,000 ducats annu- 
ally {g). 

In 1748, Mr. Watson had an opportu- 
nity of fhewiag attention to M. Kalm, dur- 
ing his abode in England^ which was from 
February till Auguft, when he embarked for 
America. He introduced him to the curi- 
ous gardens, and accompanied him in feve- 
ral botanical excurfions in the environs of 
London. This eminent pupil of Linnjsus,

Dr. Watson to thle prefent eminent Dr. 
Pallas, of Peterjburgb, during his abode 
in EnglanJ, which was from July 1761, to 
April 1762. 

In 1749, in company with Dr. Mit- 
chell, Mr. Watson examined the re* 
mains df.the garden, formerly belongihg to 
the Tradesc ANTS ; of whom, fee chap. 
14, of this work., They found the Arbu^ 
tus^ and the Cuprejfus Americana, with other 
exotics, in a vigorous ftate, after having fuf- 
tained the winters of this climate for 120 
years. This fituation had alfo afforded a 
proof, not often exemplified, of the large 
fize to which the Common Buck^Tborn will 
grow. They found one about 20 feet high, 
and near a foot in diameter {h). 
. In 1 75 1, were laid before the public, 
fome very curious and interefting particu- 
lars, relating to the kxc^ of plants, which

tended to confirm the truth of that doctrine 
in a remarkable manner. Thefc were oc- 
cafioncd by a ktter from Mr. My l ins, of 
Berlin J informing Mr. Watson, that a 
tree of the Palma ntapr foUis jlabelliformibusy 
which, although it had borne fruit for 30 
years paft, had never brought any to pcr- 
fedion, until the flowers of a male-tree^ 
brought from Leipjic, 20 German miles dif* 
tant, had been fufpended 'over its branches. 
After this operation, the tree yielded, the 
firft year, above lOo, and the fecond, upon 
repeating the experiment, above 2000 ripe 
fruit; from which 11 young Palm-trees had 
been propagated (/)• 

In the fame volume are fome remarks on 
the cafe of two women in Brabant, who had 
been nearly poifoned by eating the leaves of 
what had been called White Henbane ; but 
Mr. Watson proved, that it muft have 
been the Hyofcyamas niger, fince the ivhite 
does not grow fpontaneoufly in that coun* 
try. The fame letter confirms the poifon- 
ous effedt of the Tew-tret upon horfes(if).

Mr. Watson paid the fame tribute, in 
1751, to the memory of Dr. Henry GoMp-*

tron of Mr. Ray, as he had done to that 
of the Tradescants ; and gives a lift of 
3 3, exotic trees, which were then remaining 
in the garden at Fulham. From this eata- 
logue may be inferred, not only the original 
fplendour of the garden, and the zeal and 
tafte the Bifliop (hewed in the cultivation of 
fuch numerous curiofities, but the facility 
with which trees of very different latitudes 
may become naturalized in England (/). 

In the fame volume, page 301, we find 
" An Account of the Cinnamon Tree ;" 
occafioned by a large fpecim^ii^J^^ual in

Mr* Watson, about this time, was the 
firft, as I apprehend, who communicated to 
the Englijh reader, an Account of a Re- 
volution which was about to take place 
among the learned, in Botany and Zoolo- 
gy, refpefting ijie removal of a large body 
of marine produdtions,'' which had hereto- 
lore been ranked among vegetables ; but 
which were now proved to be of animal 
origin, and ftand under the name of Zoo- 
phytes, in the prefent Syjlem of Nature. It

ture of this'clafs, yet the full difcovery^ that 
thefe fubftances were the £ibrications of 
Pofypes, was owing to M. Peyssonnel^ 
phyiician at Guadaloupe. This gentleman 
had imbibed this opinion firft^ in 1723^ at 
Marfeilles\ and confirmed it, in 1725, oa 
the coaft of Barbary. While in Guada^ 
loHpe^ he wrote a volume of 400 pages in 
j^. in proof of this fubjcd, which he tranf- 
mitted in manufcript to the Royal So- 
ciety of London. This treatife, in which 
the jiuthpr feemed to have put the matter 
out of doubt, as to the animal origin of 
thefe bodies, was tranflated, analyzed, and 
abridged, in 1752, by Mr. Watson ; 
and published in the Pbih/Qphical Tranf-

in company with M. Trembly, had an 
opportunity, on the coaft of Sujfex, when 
on a vifit at the Duke of Richmond's, in 
one of thofe annual excurfions {p) which 
for many y^rs he ieldom failed to make in

{p) It may gratify Ae curtofity of fome, who reverence 
the name of Mr. Ray, to be informed, that in one of 
thefe excurfions, Dr. Watson was led, by his refpeft to 
the memory of that great and good man, to vifit the fpot 
where he had lived at Black Nstley^ in EJfex* This was 
in the year 176c. To Dr. Watson this was clafEcal 
ground. I was informed by him, at that time, that he 
found Mr. Ray's monument removed out of the churchy 
where it formerly ftood» into the church-yard, and hardly 
vifible for brambles: thefe he had removed while he 
flayed. That he found the houfe in a ftate which indicated 
no alteration having taken place, except what more than 
half a century of time mi^t be fuppofed neceflarily to 
have occafioned ; unle6 diat indeed fome of the windows 
were flopped up to fiive the tax ; and that the orchard 
bore all the appearance of being, as near as poffible, in the 
ftate in which it muft have been in Mr. Ray's life-time.

fhare of the favour and cfteem of that 
veteran in fcience; and wa$ honoured io. 
far, as to be nominated one of the Truftees 
of the Britifh Mufeum by Sir Hans him- 
felf, who died Jan. 11, 1753. 

After its eftablifliment in Montagu Houfe^ 
Mr. Watson was very ai3iduous» not only 
in the internal arrangement of fubje£ts» but 
alfo in getting the garden furniihed with 
plants ; infomuch that, in the firft year of 
its eftablifliment, in 1756, it contained no 
fewer than 600 fpecies, all in a fiourifhing 
ftate. 

Having given ample fpecimcns of the ge« 
nius and abilities of Mr. Watson, as a na- 
turalift, we muft now confidcr his talents in 
fome other branches of knowledge. Among 
thefe, nothing contributed fo much to ex-

clcdricity. He became early enamoured 
with the phsenomena of this wonderful 
agent in nature; an attention to which had 
been fome time before excited, among the 
philofophers of Europe ; and particularly in 
England^ by Mr. Stephen Gray, of the 
Charter-Houfe ; Granville Whieler^ Efq; 
Dr. Desaguliers; and others. 

About the year 1744, Mr. .Watson 
took it up, and made feveral important dif- 
coveries in it. At this time, it was no 
fmall advancement in the progrefs of elec- 
tricity, to be able to fire fpirit of wine. He 
was the firft in England vrho efFefted this, 
and he performed it, both by the dt'reif, 
and the repulfive power of eledtricity. He 
afterwards fired inflammable air, gunpow- 
der, and inflan^mable oils, by the fame 
meanst He alfo inflituted feveral other 
experiments, which helped to enlarge the 
power of the electrician; but the moft 
important of his difcoveries was, the prov- 
ing, that the eledtric power was not created 
by the globe or tabe, but only coUeded by 
them. Dt. Franklin, and M^ Wil-

ef this difcOTery in concluding all fabie-^ 
quent experiments. It fdon led to what 
he called " the circulation of the eledrlo 
" matter/' 

Befides thefe valuable diicQveries^ the 
Hiftorian of Eleftritity informs us^ that 
JVfr. Watson firft obfervcd the different 
colour of the fpark^ as drat)im from diffe- 
rent bodies ; that ele(^icity fuidered no re* 
fra^on in paiiing through glafs ; that the 
power of eledtricity was not affeAed by the 
prefencc or abfence of fire, fince the fparks 
were equally flrong from a freezing mix- 
ture, as from red hot iron 1 that flame and 
fmoke were conduftors of eleiffcricity ; and 
that the flrokc was, as the points of contadt 
of the non-elcdlrics on the outfide of the 
glafs- This invefligation led to the coat- 
ing of phials, in order to increafe the power 
of accumulation; and qualified him emi-^ 
nently to be the principal aftor in thofe 
famous experiments, which were made on

WATSON. 

AS Mr. Watson had conftantly lived 
in London^ he had been a curious 
obferver of the wonderful increafe and inoi- 
provement of that vaft city. He was ac- 
quainted, in no ordinary degree, with its 
hiftory, and its police in general i and had 
particularly attended to thofe circumftances 
that were more immediately, the obje<fls of 

the 
8

the philofophcr and the phyfician. This 
knowledge enabled him frequently to fug- 
geft ufeful hints ; one of which highly de^ 
ferves to be mentioned^ as it refpeifts an 
objedl of great importance. to the publie. 

In the hard winter of 1756, he wrote 
" Some Obfervations on preventing the 
** freezing of Water in the Leaden Pipes 
** of the City of London-^* occafioned by 
the injudici6u6 and inefie&ual method> 
pradifed frequently, of ftrewing dung in 
the ftreets over the pipes. Thefc were 
printed in the Gentleman' s Magazine {a) for 
January 1757* p. 6. in which is pointed 

{a) The method was fimply by means of two ^di- 
tional brafs cocks. One to be inferted into the leaden 
pipe, two feet before it comes into the air, guarded by a 
wooden cafe, filled up with horfe litter, and reaching near 
to the furface of the ground, and covered over, even with 
the ground, by a brick or ftone. This is to ferve as a 
ilop-cock, and to be turned by the help of an iron key. 
The other cock is to be faftened to the leaden pipe in 
the open air, in any part of its length, provided it be 
iTomewhat below die level of the ftop-coqk. This is in* 
fated fimply to empty the leaden pipe of all its water, 
after it has been turned ofFby the ftop-cock. From the 
defcrlption of this apparatus, the method of ufing it is ob- 
irious.

out a fucccfsFul method of effefting the 
purpofc, which he had himfelf employed 
in the fevere winter of 1739-40. Other 
inftances, beQdes this, occur, of his atten- 
tion to whatever might advance the wel- 
fare of the public. So early as the year 
.1742, he had laid before the Royal So- 
ciety ",Some Obfervations upon Mr. Sut^ 
^* tori% Invention to extradl the foul and 
** ftinking Air from the Well and other 
** Parts of Ships : With critical Remarks 
** upon the Ufe of Windfails." In which 
he fuggefts feveral improvements in that

and the number of grains^ calcnlaled by ^

It is to be feared that this method can 
fcarcely be reduced to advantageous pradlice 
on a large and agricultural plan.

Ijjpd-veflcl into the ground, where it ripens 
the frait ; hence it is named by Ray, Ara^ 
cbis Hypogaios. The oil of this pulfe is fo 
mild and well tailed, and withal fo eafily 
procured, that it might bid fair to fupcr- 
fcde that of olives, or even oil of almonds*

On examination, it appeared to be not fo

practice of phyfic, in natural hifftory, and 
experimental philofophy, were not lurprifed 
to iee him riie into the higher line of his 
pifofeffion. This event took place in 1757, 
previous to which he had been chofen. a 
member of the Rojal Academy of Madrid*, 
and he was created dodtor of phyfic by the 
Univerfity of Halk, under a diploma, bear- 
ing date September the 6th. The fame ho- 
nour was conferred upon him by that OiiJVit^ 
Umberg about the fame time. Soon after 
which he was disfranchifed from the Com- 
pany of Apothecaries. He became a lir 
centiate of the College of Phyficians in 

1759- 

This alteration in his circumftanccs and 
profpecfts, hazardous as it might be confir 
* jdered by fome, occafioned no diminution in 
his emoluments, but far the contrary. He 
had before this time removed from Atderf- 
gate Street to Lincoln s Inn Fields^ where he 
Hved the (>emainder pf his day; ; and now 
he found himfelf at greater liberty to purfue

This difeafe, on which Dr. Whytt,

be accurately noticed, and the knowledge 
of it ftrongly inculcated ; as, in the coun^

As Dr. Watson lited in intimacy with 
the moft illuftrious and learned Fellows 
of the Royal Society ; fo he was himfclf 
one of its mod active members, and ever 
zealous in promoting the ends of that in- 
ftitution. For many years he was a fre- 
quent member of the council; and, during 
the prcfidentlhip of Sir y^^^ Pr ingle, was 
clefted one of the vice-prefidents ; which 
honourable office he continued to fill to the

attendant on the public meetings cf the 
Society ; and on thq private aflbciations of 
its members, efpecially on that formerly 
held every Thurfday, at the Mitre, in Fleet 
Street, and now at the Crown and Anchor 
Tavern, in the Strand. 

In 1784, Dr. Watson was chofeii a 
Fellow of the Royal College of Phyfi- 
cians ; and made one of the Eledls. In the 
fucceeding year, he communicated to the 
College, ** An Account of a difeafe occa- 
** fioned by tranfplanting a Tooth.'* This 
was inierted in the Medical TranfaBions ; 
and this, I believe, was the laft paper he 
wrote {b). 

In 1786, he had the honour of knight- 
hood conferred upon him ; being one of the 
body deputed by the College to congratu- 
late his Majefty on his efcape from affafS- 
nation. 

In general. Sir William Watson enjoyed 
a firm ftate of health. It was fometimes 
interrupted by fits of the gout 5 but thefe 
feldom cpnfined him long to the houfe. In

veiy yifibk to his friends^ and his ftrengCh 
was greatly diminiflied, together with much 
of that vivacity which fo ftrongly marked 
his charader* He died May lO, 1787. 

Sir William Watson had a natural ac^ 
tivity both of mind and body> that never 
allowed him to he indolent in the fligbteft 
degree. He was a moft tx^^ <economift 
tff his time, and throughout life a very early 
rifer, being up ufually in fummcr at fix 
o'clock, and frequently fooner j thus fecur-' 
aig to himfelf daily two or three uninter-^ 
Aipted hours for ftudy. In his younger 
daysi thefc early hours, as I have before 
obferved, were frequently given up to the 
purpofes of fimpling ; but, in riper years, 
tficy were devoted to ftudy. He read much 
and carefelly ; and his ardent and unremit- 
ting d^fire to be acquainted with the pro- 
jgrefs of all thofe fciences which were his 
ebj€(3:s> joined to a vigorous and retentive 
ibemory^ enabled him to treafure up a vaft 
ft&ofc of 'knowledge. What^ he thas ^a^-*

correfpondencc he was copious and precife; 
and fuch as enjoyed the privilege and plea- 
fure of it, experienced in his punftuality 
another qualification which greatly en- 
hanced its value. 

Some of the firft of Sir William Wat- 
son *s papers in the Pbilofopbical TranfaC'^ 
tionsy evince his early proficiency in the 
fcience of Botany, and cfpecially his ac- 
quaintance with the Englijh fpecies : nor 
was he lefs fkilled in exotics in his riper 
years. That he was very ibon confidered 
on the continent as highly refpedable in this 
light, is manifeft from his having been on€^ 
of the few m. England, whom Mr. Clifford 
gratified with a copy of the Hortur Clif* 
fortianus', a work, at its firft publication, 
only attainable by thofe whofe ftudies and 
acquirements in the fubjefl: of it, entitled 
them to receive it from the munificence of 
Mr.CLiFFORD himfelf. In fait, all learn- 
ed foreigners, of the fame bias in their ftu- 
dies, brought letters of recommendation to 
him ; and, on their return, failed not, both 
in their correfpondencc and in their wri- 

tings^

tings, to bear honourable teftimony to his 
learning and abilities. 

Sir William Watson had learned to 
know plants by the fyftem and nomencla- 
ture of Ray, when trivial names were 
unknown ; and he was fo Angularly happy 
in a tenacious memory, as to be able to 
repeat, with wonderful promptitude, the 
long names which had been in ufe from 
the times of Bauhine, Gerard, and 
Parkinson; a taik from which botanifls 
arc relieved, by the introdu(Slion of the^ 
Linnaan trivial epithets. He lived to fee 
the fyftem of his much-honoured country- 
man give way to that of the Swede, which 
began to take place in England about this 
period ; and with which alfo he made him- 
felf acquainted. His knowledge of plants, 
and the hiftory of them in the various au- 
thors, was fo eminently extenfive, that his 
opinion was frequently appealed to as deci- 
fivc on the fubjeft; and by fome of his in- 
timate friends he was ufually called ** The 
*^ living Lexicon of Botany." Had it been 
the lot of Sir William Watson to have 
been devoted to Botany as an official em-

ployment; or had the more important 
avocations of his profefllon allowed a fur- 
ther indulgence to his favourite bias, fuch 
an union of natural endowments and ac««- 
quired knowledge as he poffeflcd, muft 
have placed him very high among the na- 
turali/ls of this age. 

It remains for me to do juflice to the 
^orth of Sir William Watson as a phy- 
iician, and as a member of fociety. But 
as thefe parts of his charafter have been 
already delineated with great truth and dif<* 
crimination by my much-refpefted friend 
t)n Garthshore, J fhall conclude this 
account by fome extradts from the Memo- 
rial read by him to a fociety of phyficians> 
of which Sir William had been the prefi- 
dent.

** and eafy to all with whom he had any

V fom of his family, and endeared him to 
•* thofe who were more immediately around

England. This event took place in the 
ipring of 1736. I am only able to afcer- 
tain the feafon of the year, . from being in- 
formed of the pleafure he exprefled, in 
meeting in the fields with thofe produc- 
tions of B;?^/^;/^, that are not fpontaneoufly 
growing in Sweden. His delight particu- 
larly, in feeing under the hedges the Hya-* 
cinih in full flower, can only be conceived 
by thofe who poflefs fome fhare of that bor 
tanical ardour which he poflefled. 

§ At 



Linnaus. 343 

At this time, the fexual fyftem exifted 
only in its outline. Enough of it| how- 
ever, was manifefted in the Florula Lap^ 
ponica^ printed in the ASla TJpfalienJiay for 
the years 1732 and 1733, and in the firft 
iketch of the Syjiema^ in 1735, to exhibit 
its novelty. I know not that the Funda-* 
menta Botanica^ the Bibliotheca^ and the 
Miifa Cliffortianay although they bear date , 
in 1736, had reached England before the 
author: yet, notwithftanding the warm 
recommendation of Boerhaave, Sir Hans 
Sloan E, confidered at that time as the 
Meccenas of Botany in this ifland, gave the 
author, and his fyftem, an unfavourable 
reception. At the age of feventy^fix, we 
need not be furprifed that the veteran fhould 
not. feel difpofed to learn a new fyftem, 
from a young man, whom he could not but 
conflder as an adventurer, both in fortune, 
in fame, and in fcience. Sloane, more- 
over, had never paid fufficient attention to 
the improvement of fcience in the con- * 
ftrudion of generical characters ; and this 
circumftance, probably, fet him at a far- 
ther diftance from embracing the fyftepi of 

Z 4 lilNNiEUSj 



344 C H A P T B R 52. 

LiNNiEUSj which exhibited an arrai^e-* 
mcnt fo- widely different from the unde** 
fined aflemblage of the Hiftory of Ja^^ 
mmca. 

It muft not however be underftood, thai 
Sir Hans Sloan e remained infenfiWp tq 
the genius and accomplifliments of Lin«^ 
N-ffius : on the contrary, when he after- 
wards fent him his Flora Lapponka^ Sir 
Hans Sloane wrote him a letter, bearing 
date Dec. 20, 1737^ expreflivcpf the great 
pleafure he received in the perufal of it^ 
exhorting him to elucidate the remaining 
parts of the natural hiftory of his country, 
on the fame plan. 

DiLLENius was highly fenfiblc of his 
merit, and gave him the moft polite recep- 
tion. But that he who had been fo long 
verfed in the fyftems of Tournefort and 
Ray, and after haying given improvement 
to the latter, by which he had deferved and 
received the appkufe, not of England alon^ 
but of all Europe^ (hould abandon that lyf- 
tem, to embrace the hitlierto uncounte- 
jianced novelties of Lin^n^0s, could not 
^cafonably be expe£ted« 

The 



Linnaui. ^45 

The journey into England however, was, 
on the whole, highly gratifying to Lin- 
N-ffiusj, He beheld with aftonifhment the 
colle<aions of Sloane, and, with rapture, 
the il?r^^^m of Petiver,Plukenet, Bu- 
DELLE, and of many others there rcpofit- 
cd, whofe names were familiar to him. At 
Oxford he infpedted, with no lefs fatisfac- 
tion, the Pinax of Sherard, which he 
had eagerly wiihed to fee published, and of 
which DxLtENius had compleated about 
a fourth part. But an undertaking of that 
nature and extent, after the death of the 
£rft projedbr of it> demanded a patronage 
and an expence, not eafily obtained. 

About die time Linn^sus made his tour 
Into this country, indigenous botany was 
qn the whole in a languKhing ftate. It no 
longer felt that degree of fupport, which 
the Sherards, and Sir Hans, had afford* 
cd it. The Conful was dead ; and the de«* 
dining years of Jit. James Sherard, and 
of Sir Hans Sloane, began to withdraw 
them from the buftle, and almoft from the 
bufinefs, of life. After the publication of 
^ay's Synapjis by Dillenius^ m 1724, 

no 



346 C H A P T E |l 52. 

no work of magnitude on the Englijh bota-r 
ny, except the Hijioria Mtrfcorum, in 1741, 
took place fpr many years ; not that there 
were wanting feveral individuals, who were 
eminent for their knowledge of indigenous 
botany, and zealous in propagating it: as 
inftances, I refer to thejnames of Watson, 
CoLLiNsoN, Miller, and Blackstone^ 
The arrival however of Lin n^ us in Eng^ 
landy and the confequent promulgation of 
his method, excited that curiofity which 
novelty will ever attraft, and, although his 
fyftem might be but little reliihcd at the 
inftant, by the Englijh naturalifts in gene- 
ral, there were yet a few into whofe minds- 
his dodtrines filcntly infinuated themfelves, 
and gained approbation. 

In the year I737> the next after Lin-» 
NJEUS left England^ he publifhed the G^- 
nera Plantarum^ which compleatly un- 
folded the fexual fyftem, as far as related to 
claffical and generical charaders; and in 
the fame year exemplified it in the fpecies, 
by the Flora Lapponica^ and the Hortus 
Cliffortianus. At the fame time, anxious 
as it fliould feem above all, to gain the ap- 
probation 



Lmnaus. " 347 

probation of DilleniuS, he dedicated to 
him the Critica Botanica ; in which he ex- 
plains his reafons for the change of names; 
and for the eftablifliment of new diftinc- 
tions, both of which, he well knew, would 
be confidered as dangerous innovations. 

Thefe volumes foon found their way into 
the libraries of the curious in England i 
though the Hortus Cliffortianus was, at firft, 
only difperfed through the munificence of 
Mr- Clifford. The fimplicity of the 
.clafHcal charaders as the bafis, the uni« 
formity of the generical notCB, confined 
wholly to the parts of frudlification, and 
that precifion which marked the fpecific 
diftin<aions, advantages, of which all fore- 
going fyftems were deftitute, foon com- 
manded the affent of the unprejudiced; and 
an interval of a few years, gave Linnjeus's 
method a decided fuperiority with Englijh 
footanift^. 

After the eftablifliment of LiNNJEUs in 
the profefforfliip in the year 1741, the pub- 
lication of the ThefeSy afterwards, in a col- 
ledled form, called the Amcenttates Acade- 
mical commenced, and, in lefs than ten 

years. 



348 C H A F T £ R 52. 

fcafSj two volumes had been publi(be^« 
Theie tra6ls» by the variety of ufeful and 
entertaining kn<>wledge» with which they 
abound, equally extended and augmented 
the reputation of Linn^us. They con* 
vinced his oppofers, that his knowledge 
wtA not bounded by mere nomenclature^ 
and iyftemltic arrangement, as was re-^ 
proachfuUy objefted. 

CONCLUSION. 

In E^^kf^f Dr. Martyn, in his F/r* 
g//, puWifhed in 17405 Dillenius, in hi$ 
Hifiopia M^fcoruniy 1741 ; and Bcack^ 
STONE, in his Specimen Botanicum^ ^74^* 
hsA referred to the writings of Linnj^us ^ 
ami oocaiionally his name hsA been men^r 
tioned in the Pbibfophical Tranfi0ions^ and 
other periodical works 4 but, as y^t^ na 
translation of any part of his writkgs^ or 
any publication on his plan, had bqen made 
in this CQuntiy, until, in 1754, a Sn^fedijl) 
pupil of the Upfal fchool arranged, by the 
generic and trivial names only, all ithe plants 
of Ray's Synopfisy according to the fyftem 
cf bis rafter. This little tra<a was im- 
mediately 



Conck^m^ 949 

sntdiatdy tranfmitted to the Hoy^ Sociel^s 
and excited much attention among thofe 
profeiTed ftudents^ and lovers of EngKJb 
botany, who obtained the pcrufal of it. 

In 1756, Dr. Browne clafled all hi» 
yamaica plants^ amounting to 1200 fpcciesy 
in the fame method. The drawings having 
been made by Eheet^ had the advantage 
of feparate delineations of the flower and 
fruit. 

In 1759, Mr. Stillihgfleet pub-?' 
lifhed a Tranflation of fcverai Trafite fijom 
the Amctnitates ; and, by tm 9wn valnaW© 
additbns^ his inftrudive Preface, line ^lidi^ 
cious and learned notes xnter^rfed tixrough^ 
out the book, by his own ^* Calendar cf 
•* Flora/' confirming and illuftrating that 
of the SweJe, greatly conduced to txzk tbo 
reputation of Linnjbus in England. Of 
^bis learned ^fid excellent man, the reader 
will find ibme memoirs in the Gentleman's 
Magazine for 1776, which were afterwards 
incorporated into ** Anecd^es of Mr* A?w^ 
*.* yer'' (fee p. 300), and iuto the Biagra^ 
pbia Dramatica^ 2d edition, 178s. 

The next year, Mr. L^e, by his Transf- 

lation 



35© CHAPTER 52. 

lation of the Elements of the Sexual Syilem, 
much contributed to facilitate the know^ 
ledge^ and extend the progrefs and popu« 
larity of it, among the lefs learned of his 
countrymen, or fuch as were unable to re- 
cur to the Fundamental or Pbilofophia Bo-- 
tanica of the author. 

. At this jundure, it is material among 
thofe circumftances which accelerated the 
progrefs of the new fyftem, to mention the 
arrival of the late much-lamented Dr.. So- 
lan dbr^ who came into England on the 
firft of July, 1760. His name, and the 
connexioD he was known to bear as the 
favourite pupil of his great mailer, had of 
themfelves fotne (hare in exciting a curio- 
lity which led to information ; whilft his 
perfe<a acquaintance with the whole fcheme 
enabled him to explain its minutefl: parts, 
and elucidate all thofe obfcurities with 
which, on a fuperficial view it was thought 
to be enveloped. I add to this, that the 
urbanity of his manners, and his readineis 
to afford every affiftance in his power, 
joined to that clearnefs and energy with, 
which he efFefted it, not only brought 
' convidlion 



Conclufioni 351 

c6nvi<ftion of its excellence in thofe Who 
were inclined to receive it, but conciliated 
the minds, and difpelled the prejudices, of 
many who had been averfe to it. 

By ^all thefe preliminary advances, the 
learned were prepared to fee the Englijh 
botany modelled according to the rules of 
the Linncean fchooL Dr, Hill feized the 
firft opportunity of attempting it, in his 
Flora Britannicay 1760 ; but it was execu- 
ted in a manner fo unworthy of his abili« 
ties, that his work can have no claim to 
the merit of having anfwered the occafion: 
and thus the credit of the atchievement fell 
to the lot of Mr. William Hudson, F. R. S. 
who, to an extenfive knowledge of EngliJI^ 
plants, acquired by an attention to nature, 
had, by his refidence in the BritiJhMufeum^ 
all the auxiliary refources th^t could favour 
his defign : accefs particularly to the Her^ 
baria of almoft all the affiftants of Ray 
and DiLLENius, mentioned in xhcSynopJis, 
gave him the opportunity of comparing the 
individual fpecimens of that Work with his 
own; and thus enabled him to difpel a 
multitude of doubts and uncertainties, in 

which. 



35^ C H A P T E B 52. 

"vehichy otherwife^ his application of tbtj^^ 
nojsyma might have been involved. 

The fexual fyftem was received nearljr 
about the lame time in the univeriities of 
Britain 'y being publicly taught by Mn 
Profeffor Martyn, at Cambridge^ and by 
Dr. Hope, at Edinburgh. The adoption 
of it by thcfc learned Profeflbrs, I confider^ 
therefore, as the aera of the eftabliflbment 
of the Linn^an fyftem in Britain — ^a fyftem, 
which, if I may be allowed the exprefTion, 
had given the author of it a literary domi-> 
nion over the vegetable kingdom; which, 
in die rapidity of its extenfion, and the 
ftrength of its influence, had not perhaps 
been paralleled in the annals of ^cieace«
