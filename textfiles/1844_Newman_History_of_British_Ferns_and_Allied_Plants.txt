Monographers, come from whence they may, have, I thinh, fair pretence to challenge some 
regard and approbation from the lovers of Natural History; for as no man can alone investigate all 
the works of Nature, these partial writers may each in his department be more accurate in their 
discoveries and freer from errors than more general writers, and so by degrees may pave the way 
to an universal correct Natural History . — Gilbert White.

the best materials for the construction of more general 
works, I have attempted, in the following pages, to give 
such a history of our British Ferns as may hereafter prove 
valuable to the general writer on Botany, while it more 
immediately addresses itself to a numerous class of readers, 
who neither contemplate the perpetration of authorship 
nor trouble themselves greatly about scientific Botany, but 
love Ferns because they are beautiful, and because they 
give zest and interest to many a ramble in the country ;

moreover, the cultivation of Ferns is becoming fashionable. 
It is no longer confined to the professed horticulturist; 
hut every one possessing good taste has made, more or 
less successfully, an attempt to rear this tribe of plants. 
Ferns constitute so beautiful a portion of the creation, — 
whether they ornament our ruins with their light and 
graceful foliage, wave their bright tresses from our weather- 
beaten rocks, or clothe with evergreen verdure our forests 
and our hedgerows, — that it seems next to impossible to 
behold them without experiencing emotions of pleasure. 
Years before Ferns had become to me as friends with ‘'old 
familiar faces,” I could not pass them without turning to 
feast my eyes on what I thought their excessive loveliness ; 
and there is something to me peculiarly gratifying in 
watching the growth of each frond when under cultivation, 
— in tracing it from its first hutton-like appearance at the 
head of the rhizoma, through its circinate youth, — so like 
the classic volute, — to its fully developed and expanded 
maturity. 

It was while wandering among the Welch mountains, 
in the autumn of 1837, that I first felt any desire to know 
the names of Ferns. I had often observed the variety 
that half covered some of those bleak and desolate regions, 
where fern is cut, dried, and housed as the only litter that 
can he obtained for horses ; but now, for the first time, I 
gathered hundreds of fronds, and employed the evenings 
in arranging them into supposed species. I found that 
three species were abundant in the most dreary and ex- 
posed wilds ; but where some rill tumbled over a precipi-

tous bank, or a ledge of rocks, keeping the surface in a 
state of perpetual moisture, half a score others were sure 
to be growing : in the chasm at Ponterwyd I think I 
counted fourteen distinct kinds. 

Of every species I could obtain, not only the fronds but 
the roots were carefully conveyed home, and, assisted hy 
Withering and Smith, I set to work, expecting to name 
them without difficulty ; but how shall I express my as- 
tonishment, when, after a minute and really attentive inves- 
tigation, I could only be certain of two species — Pteris 
aquilina and Polypodium vulgare ! I soon afterwards 
availed myself of the assistance of my botanical friends, 
and obtained names for all my Ferns. Since then I have 
paid some attention to the specific characters, as laid down 
by our best authors, and I am inclined to doubt whether 
those most distinctive have been employed. It appears 
that the manner in which a frond is cut or divided, has 
hitherto constituted almost the sole ground of specific dis- 
tinction. Now, we find a great number of specimens in a 
state of semi-cultivation, i, e,, partaking more or less of the 
influence of the spade, or plough and harrow, and nourished 
by an almost infinite variety of soils and manures ; and 
we also find amongst such specimens as great a vaiiety of 
cutting, as we do in the colours of domesticated animals. 
I think no botanist, who allows his memory to turn to the 
varieties he has observed of Lastrcea midtiflora and Poly- 
stichum aculeatum, will for a moment deny this ; and yet 
what botanist has ever presumed to treat of the cutting of 
the frond in Ferns as of any other than the highest impor- 


X 


INTRODUCTION. 


tance ? I entertain a different opinion. I think that mere 
cutting of frond is of no more value than colour in fowls 
or cows, and therefore should not be used as the leading 
character of a species : to distinguish these, I would look 
for less fickle characters in the figure, position, and cover- 
ing of the masses of seed, in the habit of the rhizoma, 
and in the general outline of the frond. 

During the summers of 1837-8-9, having many oppor- 
tunities of obtaining roots of Ferns, I planted them with 
care, for the purpose of obtaining a more correct knowledge 
of the variations to which they were subject ; and as I 
have heard a great deal of the difficulty in cultivating 
Ferns, and have met with none myself, I will here describe 
the management which I have found successful. 

Whenever I met with a Fern which I thought would 
be worth the trouble of removing, I invariably noticed the 
situation in which it grew — whether it was naturally ex- 
posed to sun, rain and wind ; whether it grew on a hori- 
zontal or perpendicular surface ; and whether its fronds were 
erect, horizontal, or pendulous ; whether its roots enjoyed 
depth of earth, or were simply 

“ Moored in the rifted rock.’ 

And having thus minutely observed every natural peculi- 
arity, my next object, when the Ferns had reached home, 
was, to copy Nature as closely as I could ; not, indeed, to 
imitate rocks and mountains by a structure of flints. Bath- 
bricks, or clinkers, but simply by supplying to each, as far 


INTRODUCTION.

as possible, the adjuncts which it naturally enjoyed : thus, 
some bog-lovers, as Osmunda regalis, were placed in slight 
excavations, which I could readily flood with water ; others, 
as Ceterach qfficinarum, which, almost deserting its native 
station on rocks, has established itself on our mortared 
walls, I supplied with crumbled mortar, carefully introduced 
between the stones, and placed the root so that, in all rains 
and in the constant waterings in which ferneries rejoice, it 
should remain as dry as possible ; for to the roots of some 
Ferns wet is as injurious as it is needful to the well-being 
of others. With regard to Osmunda, and those plants 
which require perpetual moisture, the only effectual way 
of supplying it, is by planting them in a vessel (a grape- 
jar for instance) filled with bog-earth ; this could be im- 
mersed in the ground, and any degree of moisture might 
be maintained without trouble, as the vessel would prevent 
it from being rapidly absorbed by the surrounding earth. 

A fernery, to supersede the necessity for care and atten- 
tion, should possess abundant space, a pure atmosphere, a 
variety of surface, natural shade, and a natural fall of wa- 
ter ; but all these advantages can be so closely imitated, 
that I believe there scarcely exists in the United Kingdom 
a plot of a few square yards in which the zealous cultivator 
might not accomplish everything he desired, and, with 
attention, cause the artificial to exceed in beauty the na- 
tural fernery ; for the destruction by frost and wind, both 
highly injurious to Ferns, may, with a little management, 
be completely avoided. 

In my own fernery I possess but one natural advantage 


Xll 


INTRODUCTION. 


— that of an atmosphere tolerably free from smoke ; on 
three sides, — east, south, and west, — there is a straight 
brick wall ; on the north there is an artificial mound, tole- 
rably covered with shrubs ; to the east, beyond the wall, 
are some large lime-trees, which completely shut out a 
summer morning’s sun ; at noon, the south wall casts its 
shadow on those Ferns which are planted purposely within 
its reach, and these can only be illuminated for a single 
half hour, when a summer sun is sinking unclouded in the 
north-west. Within the space enclosed by the walls are 
sundry buildings, by courtesy denominated rock-works, 
but which are in fact close imitations of the most unpictu- 
resque stone walls that ever deformed the face of a hedge- 
less country. In Scotland I have seen such walls, when 
built against a bank to prevent its crumbling into a newly 
cut road, covered with a continuous garden of our most 
beautiful Ferns ; Athyrium Filix-femina, Polypodium 
Phegopteris and P. Dryopteris, Lastrma Oreopteris and 
L. muUiJlora, Cystopteris fragilis, and Allosorus crispus, 
I have seen crowded together for hundreds of yards : the 
water from the land above is continually filtering through 
the walls, and thus the roots are supplied with a perpetual 
moisture. Witli a view of imitating this on a small scale, 
my formal walls have been built ; each is slanting at a 
slight angle from the perpendicular, and they face different 
points of the compass. One, situate under a thick Portu- 
gal laurel, has never yet been visited by a ray of sunshine — 


“ The beams of the warm sun j)lay round it in vain ; ” 


INTRODUCTION. 


Xlll 


they cannot reach it ; a second enjoys half an hour’s sun ; 
a third basks in sunshine till noon ; and thus all are varied. 

Even with this choice of situation, and after having 
noted the natural habitat, I find it best to obtain, when 
possible, a number of roots of the same species, and to 
plant them in every situation : for instance, I have placed 
Ceterach officinarum and Scolopendrium vulgare side by 
side in the darkest shade and the brightest sunlight ; hut 
Ceterach loves sun and di’ought, Scolopendrium darkness 
and moisture ; so that where Scolopendrium thrives Ceterach 
pines, and where Ceterach thrives Scolopendrium pines. 
Thus, by giving to each an abundant choice, you allow 
it to suit itself with a congenial situation, which is even 
better than condemning it to the result of observations 
which may have been erroneous. 

Having planted a number of Ferns on these principles 
of adapting the situation to each, the next grand point is to 
keep them well watered ; and this is best effected by a 
garden-engine, from which, by a pressure of the thumb on 
the stream, it may he made to descend in an almost imper- 
ceptible shower, which is much more beneficial than a 
heavy watering. If there has been no rain during the 
day, the watering should be repeated every evening during 
the summer ; hut when the fronds have ceased to grow, 
when those which are deciduous have disappeared, and 
those which are persistent have assumed their full size and 
substance, then should nothing more be done to urge them 
forward, for all require a period of rest ; a season in which 
the sap seems to circulate less freely, and a state of sloth

or torpidity supervenes ; this cannot be disturbed or has- 
tened without injuring the strength and vigour of the 
plant for the ensuing year. 

It will be found a great improvement to a fernery to 
introduce a number of mosses and Marchantise : the latter 
are particularly useful ; they speedily cover the earth and 
stones, and keep the surface in that state of moisture which 
is so very advantageous. All kinds of grasses, on the 
contrary, should be exterminated, for they are of so rapid 
a growth, and vigorous a nature, that they quickly over- 
power, weaken, and finally destroy the more delicate 
among the Ferns. 

There is one species, — Trichomanes speciosum, — which 
in some localities has its fronds always wet ; it generally 
grows within the spray of waterfalls, or in similar situa- 
tions, where it is constantly supplied with the needful 
moisture. This I find a most difficult situation to imitate, 
hut it may he managed by suspending above the Fern a 
vessel containing water, which shall he allowed to drop 
slowly on a stone, or other hard substance in the neigh- 
bourhood of the plant, the fronds of which vdll be wetted 
by the sprinkling caused by each drop. Polypodium Phe- 
gopteris and Cystopteris fmgilis benefit greatly by a 
similar treatment. 

There is one Fern, — Asplenium marinum, — which 
hitherto I have failed to cultivate in anything like its na- 
tural luxuriance : this species grows on the most exposed 
rocks on our bleakest shores, and yet I believe it has never 
been cultivated in the open air with success : in a tempe-

rature of 70 ° Falir. it will grow with vast rapidity ; and 
with a lower temperature, with artificial protection, it also 
answers very well. 

Adopting this plan of cultivation, I have possessed the 
opportunity of observing the changes that took place, and 
of watching, as it were, the progress of variation. I have 
pressed fronds from the same root for three successive 
years, and have found variations abundantly adequate to 
the establishment of species quite as distinct as many of 
those in the English Flora ; and I consider all that culti- 
vation, as I have explained it, can accomplish for any 
plant, is to hasten or delay those changes to which that 
plant is by nature liable : it cannot increase or diminish 
the number of actual species. In those species liable to 
great extremes in the cutting of their fronds, I have ob- 
served that a soil composed of decaying wood, abundantly 
supplied, and completely covering the roots, hastens a de- 
velopment of the most divided form which they can possi- 
bly assume, while a mixture of sand and stones, and a 
deficiency even of these, retards the development, and 
not unfrequently causes the plant to return to a more 
simple form. 

Besides the British Ferns, all the species indigenous to 
the northern regions of America, Europe, and Asia, may 
be grown in the open air, and without protection, excepting 
from severe irost, when they should he covered with straw, 
matting, or dried tan, thus supplying that warm clothing 
of snow which protects them from extreme cold in their 
native habitats. But if we advance one step, and restrain 


XVI 


INTRODUCTION, 


the free communication with the outer air, then there 
seems to be no limit to the species we may introduce — 
the beautiful productions of the tropics may be brought to 
our doors. 

How often has it been repeated^ that he who causes an 
ear of wheat to grow where it never grew before, is one 
of the greatest benefactors to mankind ! If this he true, 
must we not also regard as a benefactor the man who has 
introduced the loveliest scenery of nature into the most 
crowded streets of our sooty and muddy metropolis ! who 
has clothed our courtyards, aye, even our windows, with a 
perpetual summer ! who has realized that sweet land of a 
poet’s imagination — 


“ Where a leaf never dies in the still blooming bowers ! ” 


It is Mr. Ward* who has effected this. His plan, 
although improved, I may perhaps say perfected, by various 
accessories, depends primarily and fundamentally on pro- 
tecting the plants from too free communication with the 
outer air. This end is obtained by the use of glass, the 
light so essential to vegetation being thus freely admitted. 
The most ready way to try the experiment is, to procure a 
glass vessel, for instance, one of those jars used by drug- 
gists and confectioners ; introduce some soft sandstone, or 
some light soil, filling one-sixth of the jar with it, and 
taking care that the earth be very moist, yet allowing no

water to settle at the bottom of the jar ; plant a fern in 
the earth, and then cover the jar with its glass lid, first 
supplying a slip of wash-leather round the rim of the jar, 
which will pretty nearly cut off the communication between 
the internal and external air ; no farther attention will be 
required : the fern will live, thrive, and probably seed, the 
seed also vegetating, and at last the jar will become too 
small for its contents ; no watering is needed ; the moisture 
in the earth will exhale, condense on the glass, trickle down 
its sides, and so return to the earth whence it arose. 

There is no limit to the application of this principle : 
instead of a jar, it is easy to construct in the window-sill 
a box, extending throughout its entire length, the bottom 
and sides being lined with zinc, to prevent the moisture 
from damaging the adjoining wood-work ; then let the 
window be a double one, like those in Russia, leaving a 
space of six or twelve inches between the inner and outer 
glass. The ferns so planted in the box, which should 
contain a depth of five or six inches of light sandy earth, 
will soon fill up the space between the two windows, supply- 
ing the most beautiful curtain or blind that could possibly 
be invented. The plants need not be ferns exclusively ; 
roses, fuchsias, &c., would also thrive ; but it must always 
be borne in mind, that plants requiring a humid atmosphere 
should not be inclosed with those which prefer aridity : of 
course the upper sash alone must be made moveable. 
Extending the plan still farther, a large conservatory may 
be constructed, or even a large garden, entirely inclosed 
with glass ; all the doors should be fitted with great nicety

and exactness, and would be better if double, and always 
one of them shut before tbe other is opened. 

Houses on a large scale can scarcely be made sufficiently 
air-tiglit to prevent the escape of aipeous exhalations : a 
leaden pipe, pierced with small holes, should therefore be 
carried round the building, at as great a height as may be 
found practicable, and this pipe connected with a reservoir, 
so that an artificial shower could be produced at pleasure ; 
if an increase of temperature were considered necessary, 
it might readily be attained by the introduction of hot- 
water pipes in the usual way. 

So great is the advantage of this plan, that the plants of 
tropical regions can now be cultivated in London with the 
most perfect success ; and, what is of still greater impor- 
tance, may be conveyed, uninjured by extremes of heat 
and cold, and without any additional supply of moisture, 
from the most distant parts of the earth. Mr. Ward, and 
Messrs. Loddiges of Hackney, have, in their glass cases, 
transmitted our plants to the most distant countries, and 
have received the same cases in return filled with valuable 
exotics, many of which have never previously reached this 
country in a living state. 

But the most pleasing character of this mode of cultiva- 
tion is, that it can be adapted to any spot that fancy may 
select : plants in this way may be grown in a drawing- 
room, without ever making the least litter or apparent un- 
tidiness, and without the trouble attendant on watering. 
If the cases were opened annually it would be sufficiently 
often, and the decayed fronds, or a too luxuriant growth,

might be removed, and a little water added, if there ap- 
peared a necessity for it. 

Ferns, mosses, and all kinds of cryptogamous plants, 
seem to spring up spontaneously in these cases ; and the 
surface of the earth speedily becomes clothed not only with 
a beautiful but a highly interesting vegetation. The rais- 
ing of ferns from seed, in the manner hereafter described, 
offers a ready way of ascertaining beyond question the 
value and limits of each species. 

It has often been considered somewhat unaccountable 
that plants should thrive when deprived of air. I believe 
a philosopher would smile at the idea of a vacuum existing 
in a vessel containing abundance of earth, water, and living 
vegetables ; but let us consider the subject without refe- 
rence to any philosophical inquiry. It must, then, be 
understood as an unquestionable fact, that in closing the 
vessel no attempt is ever made to exclude the air which it 
contains, or even by any experiment to diminish its quan- 
tity ; therefore, admitting the property of air to press 
equally in all directions, we must take it for granted that 
there is as much air in the vessel as in an equal space out- 
side the vessel ; and so, the idea that the ferns are living 
without air not being based on fact, requires no refutation. 
The next source of wonder is, that a fern should tln-ive 
deprived of that fresh air, or that change of air, which, in 
a state of nature, it is constantly enjoying. The term 
fresh air, though so continually used, has no very definite 
meaning. If it applies to air that has not been breathed 
by animals, I believe we shall find that animals alone are 

h 2 


XX 


INTRODUCTION. 


injured by respiring air from which oxygen has been ab- 
stracted by previous respiration : change of air, whether 
beneficial or otherwise, does take place, for our contrivances, 
although they retard, cannot preclude a change. Thus 
the supposed anomalies of plants living without air, or 
without change of air, are either dissipated or softened 
down : we will inquire whence arise the benefits of this plan. 

In London the air is loaded with particles of soot, than 
which there is scarcely any substance more injurious to 
vegetation ; a single smut,” as it is usually called, causes 
a yellow mark wherever it has adhered to a leaf ; and the 
result of an atmosphere loaded with smuts is the rapid 
destruction of the leaves, so that the leaves of London 
trees are never in a perfectly natural state ; they difier in 
appearance, colour, and health, so to speak, from the leaves 
of country trees : the deleterious effects of London smut 
on the leaves influence the growth of the tree itself, and 
London trees are invariably of slower growth, and of less 
healthy appearance, than those in the country. By the 
plan of cultivating plants in closed vessels this injury is 
entirely avoided, the smut and all solids borne by the 
atmosphere being completely excluded, and forming a thick 
deposit on the glass ; if the vessel employed be a bell 
glass inverted over the plant, then every accession of at- 
mospheric air must take place through the earth, and 
consequently no portion of its impurities will be deposited 
on the plant. Mr. Ward is perfectly right, when he attri- 
butes the sickly state of London vegetation to the de- 
pressing influence of the fuliginous matter with which the 


INTRODUCTION. 


XXI 


atmosphere in which he lives is surrounded : ” but it ap- 
pears that other causes have been sought in the presence 
of gases injurious to vegetable life. This theory I shall 
now examine. 

Mr. Ellis, ^ in an excellent paper read to the Botanical 
Society, in June, 1839 , and published in the fifteenth vo- 
lume of the ^ Gardener’s Magazine,’ objects to the idea 
previously expressed by Mr. Ward, of the deleterious in- 
fluence of this smut or fuliginous matter, and goes on to 
explain at length, that the real mode in which such an 
atmosphere proves injurious to vegetation was first shown 
by the experiments of Drs. Turner and Christison, which 
were published in the ninety-third number of the ‘ Edin- 
burgh Medical and Surgical Journal.’ They ascertained 
that it is not simply to the diflusion of fuliginous matter 
through the air, but to the presence of sulphurous acid 
gas, generated in the combustion of coal, that the mischief 
is to he ascribed. When added to common air, in the 
proportion of -9 oW or to^-^ part, that gas sensibly affected 
the leaves of growing plants in ten or twelve hours, and 
killed them in forty-eight hours or less. The effects of 
hydro-chloric, or muriatic acid gas, were still more power- 
ful, it being found that the tenth part of a cubic inch in 
20,000 volumes of ah’, manifested its action in a few hours, 
and entirely destroyed the plant in two days. Both these 
gases acted on the leaves, affecting more or less their co- 
lour, and withering and crisping their texture, so that a

by all who knew him.

gentle touch caused their separation from the footstalk ; and 
both exerted this injurious operation when present in such 
minute proportions as to he wholly inappreciable to the 
animal senses. After having suffered much injury from 
these acid gases, the plants, if removed in time, will re- 
cover, hut with the loss of their leaves. Hence in vegeta- 
tion, earned on in a smoky atmosphere, the plants are 
rarely killed altogether, but merely bhghted for the season : 
accordingly, in spring vegetation re^^ommences with its ac- 
customed luxuriance ; and as, in many situations, there is 
at that season, and through the summer, a considerable 
diminution in the number of coal fires, there will be a 
proportionate decrease in the production of sulphurous acid 
gas, and consequently less injury will be done to plants 
during that season. In winter, too, when coal fires mostly 
abound, and gas is most abundantly generated, deciduous 
plants are protected from its noxious operation by suspen- 
sion of their vegetating powers ; hut the leaves of evergreens, 
which continue to grow during that season, are constantly 
exposed to its action when present in its greatest intensity. 
Accordingly, in many of the suburban districts around 
London, especially in the course of the river, where new 
manufactories are constantly rising up, the atmosphere is 
so highly charged with noxious matters, that many decidu- 
ous plants, and almost all evergreens, cease to flourish, or 
exhibit only a sickly vegetation. In an interesting bio- 
graphical sketch of his late lamented friend Dr. Turner, 
Professor Christison confirms, by subsequent experience, 
the opinion formerly given respecting the noxious operation

of the sulphurous aud muriatic acid gases on plants ; he 
describes their action as so energetic, that, in the course of 
two days, the whole vegetation of various species of plants 
may he destroyed by quantities so minute as to he altogether 
inappreciable by the senses. On two occasions he was 
able to trace the identical effects of the same kind of works 
(the black ash manufactory) on the great scale which his 
friend and himself witnessed in their researches. In one 
instance, the devastation committed was enormous, vegeta- 
tion being for the most part miserably stunted, or blasted 
altogether, to a distance of fully a third of a mile from the 
works, in the prevailing dnection of the wind.” 

Mr. Ellis’s is an extremely pleasing and well-wiitten 
papery it is full of very valuable information, collected 
with industry, and arranged with care ; the experiments to 
which he refers are of undoubted authority, and strictly 
applicable to general principles in the way intended by their 
various authors. I think they will he received as conclusive 
by that large class of readers which prefers the dictum of 
a philosopher to the fatigue of inquiry ; hut never by that 
limited class — that troublesome and inquiring class — which 
takes nothing for granted, which, in reading a well-arranged 
and instructive series of illustrations, argumentatively ap- 
plied, is continually asking, Quo tramite tendis ? ” And 
when, at length, the goal is discovered to which Mr. Ellis 
is conducting it — when he briefly concludes, Against the 
evils arising from such a vitiated atmosphere, the plan of 
Mr. Ward provides effectual protection, as the success of 
his establishment amply demonstrates,” then this little jury 


XXIV 


INTRODUCTION. 


pronounces instantly a verdict of Not Proven.” Mr. 
Ellis seems scarcely aware of tlie extreme difficulty 
of maintaining any essential difference between tbe com- 
ponent parts of atmospheric air on the internal or external 
side of any given partition. He seems scarcely aware that 
Mr. Ward’s establishment — the success of which he justly 
considers beyond dispute — communicates with the sur- 
rounding mmky and foul atmosphere by means of a glass 
door, of the usual construction — a door opened by every 
visitor on entering this paradise — 

“ Exiguus spatio, variis sed fertilis herbis : ” * 

And again by every visitor on returning ; and that these 
openings are much too frequent to allow the possibility of 
maintaining any difference in the proportions of the gases 
composing the internal and external air, even supposing 
that the air would not so far elude Mr. Ward’s care, were the 
door constantly shut, as not to insinuate itself through the 
broken panes and other apertures which every glass house 
must possess. Before assigning the excess of sulphurous 
and muriatic-acid gases as the deleterious property of the 
atmosphere obviated by Mr. Ward’s plan, Mr. Ellis should 
have shown us that this excess was so obviated. He should 
have shown us that the deleterious gases did not exist 
within ; he should have tested the interior, and given us 
the result ; he should have told us by what mystic charac- 
ter engraved on the threshold these gases were scared 
away ; in short, he should have done what he has not done

— he should have analyzed facts rather than assumed them. 
The small inquiring class, finding that this important link 
in the chain of argument is deficient, will be apt to think 
that the lapse of that single link sets adrift the entire cargo 
of conclusions. 

Having dismissed the gases with the alternative, that 
either they do not exist in any undue proportion in Mr. 
Ward’s fernery and its neighbourhood, or that they do 
exist, and are not injurious to vegetation ; having seen 
also that fuliginous matter does exist in the atmosphere to 
a great extent, that it is highly injurious to the growth of 
vegetables, and that it is excluded by Mr. Ward’s plan, we 
shall perhaps he expected, without further inquiry, to con- 
clude that in the exclusion of fuliginous matter rests the 
whole secret of its effect. To this I must demur, or the 
use of these closed cases would he confined to London and 
similar smoky atmospheres ; whereas it is well known the 
sphere of their utility is universal. Every cultivator in 
the country could adduce his proofs of this. I will cite 
one only. 

On a hot day in the summer of 1837, I brought home in 
a tin box about a dozen seedlings of Lastrcea multijlora, 
which I had picked out of moss ; each had a single frond 
of very small size, and extremely minute, white, and deli- 
cate roots. Having a wide -mouthed phial at hand, I put 
in it a small quantity of very wet earth ; and then passing 
a pin through the single frond of one of the seedlings, 
and pinning it to a cork previously covered with wet wash- 
leather, I fixed the cork firmly in the phial, and left the 


XXVI 


INTRODUCTION. 


fern hanging at the head of the pin with its roots down- 
wards. Some hours afterwards I looked at my little fern, 
and found it exhibited no symptoms of withering ; whereas 
the other seedlings, left carelessly on the ground beside the 
phial, were completely dead, and crumbled to powder be- 
tween the finger and thumb. I hung up the phial by a 
stiing to a nail in the garden wall, and here it was hanging 
twelve months afterwards. The cork was fastened exactly 
as I left it, but the phial was filled with something green, 
which, on taking it out, proved to he a plant of the com- 
mon chickweed, hut to my great joy the little fern still 
hung from the pin ; its roots were longer, it had made two 
fi’onds, and the original frond had withered, hut was still 
strong enough to support the fern. This instance is as 
good as a thousand. The exposure of the roots, which is 
no part of Mr. Ward’s plan, still adds a proof of its effi- 
cacy. The plant could not have lived one day so exposed 
in the open air ; in the phial it had lived a year, had re- 
newed its fronds, and looked healthy. How was this 
effect produced ? 

Who has regarded Nature without perceiving the word 
CHANGE legibly engraven on every object ? Throughout 
creation there is a perpetual decay, and a perpetual reno- 
vation. Death is the result of life, for life contains within 
itself the germ of death. This fact is so obvious, that it 
were idle to adduce proofs. There are many active agents 
in this change ; and it may he observed, that the office of 
every agent is to hurry forward the eternal round : the sun 
is equally the source of life and death : wind, rain, heat, 


INTRODUCTION.

cold, all are perpetual agents in this one work. If we 
seek for the accessory circumstances most favourable to 
the rapid and healthy growth of ferns, and refer for the 
information to Natoe herself, we shall generally find 
them in protection from the sun’s rays, in the uniformity 
and excess of atmospheric humidity, in the absence of 
extremes of heat and cold, in the gradual transition from 
one to the other, when these extremes do occur, and, 
finally, in that perfect stillness of the atmosphere which is 
rarely realized in Nature, except in caves, fissures of rocks, 
wells, and a few similar situations : the opposites of all 
these are the agents of decay and destruction, — the excess 
of atmospheric aridity, sudden alterations in the tempera- 
ture, as in the frosts of spring, excessive heat, high and 
boisterous winds. Were not this law of destruction in per- 
petual operation, as well as the law of renovation — were 
they not invariably linked as it were hand in hand, the 
surface of the earth would become in one extreme a desert, 
untenanted by living things, in the other a self-destructive 
crowd. 

Returning to the phial, and therefore to all closed vessels 
or buildings, we cannot fail to perceive, that while all the 
agents of life — all the vivifying principles — are allowed 
the fullest scope for their operations ; the destructive ones 
are in a greater or less degree excluded Nature is still at 
work ; no particle of the benefit results from human skill ; 
we add no gases to those around us in order to make the 
air more nourishing ; we subtract none to make it more 
pure. Atmospheric humidity is one of the most important 


XXVlll 


INTRODUCTION. 


agents in the vitality and luxuiiant growth of ferns ; and 
this is attained in closed cases, or under bell-glasses, in 
such perfection, that the most moisture-loving of all our 
species — Trichomanes speciosum, of which I have before 
spoken as delighting in the spray of water-falls — not 
only lives but thrives. Mr. Ward has this plant growing 
with a luxuriance and vigour that can seldom he exceeded 
in a state of nature. To the rapid transitions from heat to 
cold, so common in our climate, and so particularly injuri- 
ous to tender vegetables, these cases offer a complete har- 
rier 3 for experiments prove, beyond question, that the 
atmosphere within the glass retains its degree of tempera- 
ture very long after a change has taken place in the air 
that surrounds it, and excess of cold, accompanied by per- 
fect stillness, is incomparably less injurious tlian when 
coupled with rapid motion. Thus our travellers in Polar 
regions speak of intense cold, as indicated by the thermo- 
meter, having been scarcely inconvenient to them if the 
atmosphere were perfectly still ; but if the wind rose, al- 
though the quicksilver rose simultaneously, as was almost 
invariably the case, the cold was most distressing. In 
England, if Fahrenheit’s thermometer he at 30'’, we walk 
about or stand exposed to it without any sensation of pain, 
but if we face it in travelling by railway at the rate of 
thirty miles an hour, the cold becomes almost intolerable. 
In fact, it has been abundantly proved by experiment, that 
a much greater extreme of heat or cold may he borne by 
plants, by animals, and even by the human frame, if both 
the atmosphere and the objects of experiments be in a 


INTRODUCTION. 


XXIX 


state of perfect quiescence. In closed cases we thus not 
only avoid rapid changes of temperature, hut the active 
motion in extremes of temperature, which is the most in- 
jurious property of such extremes. The deleteiious effect 
of boisterous winds on the fragile fronds of ferns needs no 
exemplification ; it is so great, that if a specimen of Cys- 
topteris he moved from its protected habitat, and placed 
where it may receive the full force of the wind, that alone 
will, in a few weeks, work its utter destruction : to such a 
plant how grateful must be the motionless atmosphere thus 
provided ! 

The solution of the problem appears to me to he simply 
this : that while the power of destructive natural agents is 
restrained, that of beneficial natural agents is retained, and 
its efficacy ensured. 

Carrying out the system, nothing is more easy than to 
raise any species of Fern from the seed, which every her- 
barium affords abundant opportunity of procuring; and 
thus Ferns from every country may he assembled in our 
houses, with even less trouble than by transporting the 
roots in cases. The seeds should be first detached from 
the frond by gently rubbing the clusters of capsules, and 
then shaken on a common plate ; next, having procured 
some light sandy earth, crumble it on the plate, and shake 
it about for a minute or two, when all the seeds will be 
found adhering to the little masses of earth ; spread this 
earth, as lightly as may he, over other light sandy or loamy 
earth, either in a garden or in a flower-pot, in doors or out, 
always taking care very carefully to cover the seed with a 


XXX 


INTRODUCTION, 


bell glass, or other glass cover, excluding, as completely as 
possible, communication with the outer air. In a few weeks 
the young Ferns will come up abundantly, in a sinuous 
horizontal frond, closely resembling that of Marchantia ; 
but in a very short time other fronds will succeed, having 
the true characters of Ferns. 


In my descriptions I have endeavoured, as far as practi- 
cable, to combine simplicity with uniformity. I am aware 
that some readers may possibly object to the occurrence of 
Latin or technical words, but these are never used when a 
common English word would answer the purpose. I think 
it must be obvious to the understanding of every one that 
it is needful to have a term that shall he sufficiently precise 
to express what is intended, and I believe our best bota- 
nists aim at nothing more, although they are frequently 
charged with the invention of unintelligible words. I trust 
that the technical words used in the present volume will 
be found not only few in number, but will be rendered 
perfectly intelhgible by the following explanation. I have 
treated every fern as having three parts, — the roots, the 
rhizoma, and the fronds : if the reader will turn to pages 
93, 115 and 131, he will see examples of these three parts ; 
in every instance the worm-like stem running horizontally 
or across the page is the rhizoma ; the upright stems which 
ascend from this, together with the apparent leaf at their 
summit, are the fronds ; and the fibres are the I'oots, The 
rhizoma in all these instances is said to be creeping, and is 
in fact an underground stem : when this is the case the 


INTRODUCTION. 


XXXI 


fronds rise from it separately, and often at considerable 
distances from each other. The rhizoma is sometimes said 
to he tufted; instances of this are shown at pages 163, 208 
and 249 : a tufted rhizoma is robust, compact and erect ; 
it hears a tuft of fronds at its extremity. The fronds are 
something like deciduous branches ; they cannot with pro- 
priety be called leaves, although some modern botanists 
have attempted to introduce that name : they generally 
consist of a stem and a leafy portion ; the stem being par- 
tially naked and partially continued through the leafy por- 
tion to its extremity. The whole of this stem is often 
called the rachis, but our most able botanists divide it into 
two parts, calling the lower portion where naked the stipes, 
and the upper portion the rachis. I have not used these 
words, but have always spoken of it as a stalk or stem. 

The fronds of ferns are generally very much divided, 
and are usually described by the amount or character of 
divisions. The fronds at page 289 are simple or undivided, 
those at pages vii and 293 are deeply notched or pinnati- 
fid, and those at pages 137, 143, 163, 273, 281 and 285, 
are called pinnate, the leaf-like divisions being termed 
pinncB. The pinnce are more or less divided : fig. h at 
page 187 represents a pinnatifid pinna, and at page 209 
all the pinnce are pinnate, or completely divided into a 
series of leaf-like divisions called pinnules, and these pin- 
nules again are either simple, pinnatifid, or pinnate. 

The seed of ferns are usually produced in little capsules, 
surrounded by a jointed ring, which terminates below in a 
short stalk ; the capsule when ripe splits open, and the 


XXXll 


INTRODUCTION. 


elastic ring, by a series of jerks, throws out the seed : three 
of these capsules are represented in the centre of the figure 
on the title-page. These capsules are also called thecce 
and sporangia : they are generally seated on the back of 
the frond in clusters, often called sori ; but I have carefully 
avoided the use of these words, thinking the English ones 
— i. e. capsules and clusters — better in every respect ; they 
are more correct, more expressive, and more intelligible. 
The clusters of capsules are frequently hidden by a thin 
membranous cover, which I have called an involucre ; it is 
often called an indusium : the white space in the title-page, 
in which the three capsules are placed, shows the shape of 
one of these involucres. 

And now I believe I have only to offer my best thanks 
to those botanists who have rendered me such zealous and 
important assistance during the progress of my work ; and 
I trust that my coadjutors will not think me guilty of un- 
kindness or ingratitude in substituting this general acknow- 
ledgment for individual thanks. Were I to make out 
a list of all the correspondents who have assisted me it 
would be wearisome from its length, and I cannot consent 
to make a selection of particular names when the object of 
all has been the same : as a matter of course the commu- 
nications of some correspondents have been more available 
than those of others, yet the same spirit of kindness and 
goodwill has influenced all, and all therefore have an 
equal claim on my sincere and heartfelt gratitude. I have 
endeavoured to exercise the greatest care in acknowledging 
every communication in its proper place.

A HISTORY 


OF 

BRITISH FERNS, &c. 


It is with a feeling of some regret that I am compelled to ac- 
knowdedge my inability to define, with anything like precision, 
the group including those plants of which it is the object of the 
following pages to treat. I can, indeed, plead abundant prece- 
dent for associating them together ; and I believe it will be the 
wiser course, in this instance, to be ruled by authority, rather 
than attempt the defence of a combination, which certainly ap- 
pears, in some respects, of questionable propriety ; and here I 
must further observe that the arrangement and nomenclature 
proposed in this Synopsis are but partially adopted in the body 
of .the work. 

Linneus proposed for this group of plants the name Filices, 
and placed them as the first order of his twenty-fourth class — 
Cryptogaraia ; and by far the greater number of succeeding bo- 
tanists appear to have approved and followed the same course. 
I venture however to suggest that the group, in modern classifi- 
cation, is of higher rank than order^ a term which I propose 
transferring to its six* principal divisions, as under. 

* It may here be remarked that the species of Chara form a group very ana- 
logous to the Equisetacece. Lamarck and DeCandolle unite the genera Chara, 
Nayas jind Lemna in a family called Nayades, placing it immediately after the 
Equisetacece, which they treat as another family of equal value. If this view of 
the case he correct, we have seven orders of filicoid plants, which follow the law 
pointed out in my essay, ‘ 'J'he System of Nature,’ as constituting three pairs of 
circumferential and a normal central group ; thus : —

of frond.

Order I. — EQUISETACEiE. 

Semi-aquatic plants, composed of tough fibrous roots, a joint- 
ed hollow cylindrical subterranean rhizoma, and erect jointed 
hollow cylindrical leafless stems, which are generally furnished 
at each joint with a whorl of jointed hollow angular leafless 
branches : the fructification is produced in terminal spikes or 
catkins, and these are either borne at the head of the usual stem 
or on separate earlier shorter stouter and more succulent stems, 
which decay immediately after the escape of the seed. Bota- 
nists are agreed in placing all the species of this order in the 

Genus Equisetum, Linfieus, the characters of which are con- 
sequently identical with those of the order. The British spe- 
cies are

Linneus, Sp. PI. 1517. — Since writing my observations 
on this supposed species, I have been induced to modify 
my opinion as to the certainty of its being a variety of the 
preceding : it appears to grow at a greater elevation, to 
prefer boggy or muddy localities to actual w^ater, and ne- 
ver, under any circumstances, to become branched. I am 
indebted to Dr. Taylor for specimens from the neighbour- 
hood of Dunkerron, where it grows in such profusion as to 
be cut and dried for fodder. Dr. Balfour has found it in 
Scotland. I place it doubtingly as a species.

Ordek II. — FILICACEiE. 

Plants composed of fibrous roots, simple solid rhizoma, and 
flat leafy fronds which rise with a circinate vernation and bear 
capsules in clusters on their back or edges. The capsules are 
provided with an elastic jointed ring. The divisions of this 
order are still obscure, and require further investigation • the 
subjoined arrangement results from the combined employment 
of the characters used by Ray, Linneus, Presl and John Smith. 

Family. — Adiante^. 

The ultimate divisions of the frond generally stipitate and

The ultimate divisions of the frond sessile, having a distinct 
midvein, the lateral veins anastomose in a linear series on each 
side of midvein : capsules seated in a continuous line on that 
side of these anastomosing veins which is nearest the midvein, 
covered by a continuous linear lateral involucre which opens to- 
wards the midvein.

Family. — Asplene^. Spleenworts. 

A large and varied group approaching very nearly to the last, 
but constantly differing : the capsules are seated in linear clus- 
ters on one side of lateral veins, whose direction is always at an 
angle with the median line of the pinnule, so that in no instance 
can two or more of these lines of capsules form a continuous

line : each cluster is covered more or less completely by a linear 
lateral involucre. 

Genus^ Notolepeum. Mid vein of pinnules present, lateral 

veins alternate branched, branches anastomosing among them- 
selves and with the branches of the next lateral vein : clusters 
of capsules on the first anterior branch of each lateral vein, and 
all of them directed towards the apex of pinnule, except in 
the first lateral veins, both branches of which bear clusters, the 
anterior cluster directed as usual, but the posterior towards the 
midrib of the frond, these are therefore placed back to back ; 
each cluster is accompanied by a narrow and nearly erect invo- 
lucre occupying the same position with regard to the capsules 
as that of a true Asplenium : the back of the frond is densely 
clothed with pointed overlapping scales. 

Observation. — This genus has long been noticed as distinct, 
but I have seen no description in which the characters are cor- 
rectly given. The venation, as well as the position and direc- 
tion of the capsules, are shown at p. 301. A new name seemed 
needful ; the names of Scolopendriiim, Grammitis and Gym- 
nogramma.) successively employed, have been severally restricted 
to very different genera, and that of Ceterach seems objection- 
able as belonging of right to the species.

Genus Phyllitis. Lateral veins twice or thrice bifurcate, free 
at the extremity, capsules in linear series upon the anterior and 
posterior branches, on the anterior directed towards the apex 
of the frond, on posterior towards its base, always in pairs, 
i. e., when the anterior branch of a lateral vein bears a line of 
capsules the posterior branch on the lateral vein next before it 
also bears a line of capsules corresponding in length, and the 
two lines or series form a cohfluent mass of capsules covered by 
two involucres which face each other, and even in an early stage 
of growth overlap and appear united.

Equisetum hyemale, Linneiis. 


This plant appears to be almost unknown in the midland and 
southern English counties. Indeed, throughout the kingdom it is 
but sparingly distributed, and may be considered a strictly local 
plant. In Turner and Dillwyn’s Botanist’s Guide,’ the follow- 
ing English habitats are recorded : — in Northumberland, Scott’s 
wood, wood below Mill green, and Heaton wood ; in Cumber- 
land, Lowgelt-bridge ; in Durham, woods about Derwent-bridge

and Castle Eden-Dean ; in Yorkshire, woods at Castle Howard 
and Kirkhain, Rigby woods near Pontefract, near Ingleton and 
Halifax, about Leeds, Hackfall, near Huby, Laver banks and 
Mackershaw wood, on the banks of the Skell by Ripon ; in 
Cheshire, near Arden-Hall, in a wood close to the river ; in 
Norfolk, St. Faith’s bog and Arming-Hall wood, near Norwich ; 
in Nottinghamshire, about the middle of Nettleworth green, 
two miles from Mansfield, plentifully among the rashes ; in 
Warwickshire, in a moist ditch near Middleton ; in Cambridge- 
shire, Stretham ferry and Gamlingay bogs ; in Bedfordshire, 
Potton marshes and Ampthill bogs : in Wiltshire, in a rivulet 
near Broadstitch Abbey, plentifully. The same authors have 
recorded two Welch habitats : — in Denbighshire, on the west 
side of the brook that runs from Henllan mill into the river Elwy, 
about 300 yards from Trap bridge, less than a mile from Garm ; 
and in Flintshire, near Maesmynnan. In addition to these lo- 
calities, I am enabled, through the kindness of correspondents, 
to give the following : — in Yorkshire, by the Derwent at Cram- 
beck, and near Raskelf, J. Backhouse, jun.,” Bolton vroods in 
Wharfedale, S. Gibson,” and by the banks of a rivulet in 
Conesthorpe, H. Ibbotson ; ” Lancashire, in small quantities, 
in Mereclough, near Manchester, J. B. Wood Cheshire, ^^Lally’s 
wood, near Over, W. Wilson ; ” Worcestershire, Mosley Bog, 
G. W. Perry;” and Leicestershire, “ Gracedieu, C. Babington.” 

Through the liberality of Dr. Greville, Dr. Balfour and Dr. 
Campbell, T have received specimens from several Scotch habi- 
tats, more particularly the vicinity of Edinburgh ; Mr, Brichan 
has obligingly sent me specimens from the banks of the Dee, 
Kincardineshire ; Mr. Kippist informs me that he has seen it in 
abundance in the woods about Corra Lyn, Lanarkshire ; and 
the Rev. G. Gordon mentions it as very abundant in the bog at 
Pittendriech, in Moray. In Ireland, Mr. Mackay and Mr. 
Moore have found it in the counties Dublin and Wicklow. 

The figures usually quoted as representing this plant are so 
incorrect that they can only be referred to with doubt. Tragus*

tended for representations of Equisetmn hyemale, have adorned 
the upper part of each stem with whorls of short branches, which 
give the plant a very extraordinary appearance, and suggest the 
idea of their being intended for Equisetumjluviatile or Hippu- 
ris vulgaris^ the upper part of the stems much resembling the 
latter plant ; and it may be added that Tragus assigns to his fi- 
gure the name of Hippuris. It should however be observed 
that one of these figures is a servile copy from the other, the 
outline having been traced and transferred to another block, by 
which the figure has been reversed. The figure in Matthiolus,^ 
also supposed to refer to this species, may possibly be intended 
for the E. variegatum of this work ; but I can only venture this 
as a suggestion, for it is by no means characteristic of any plant 
wdth which I am acquainted. Gerarde’s figuref evidently repre- 
sents variegatum, the specimen selected for the purpose being 
more than usually divided : the learned author however ascribes 
to his plant the property usually assigned exclusively to the 
present species, speaking of it as the “ small and naked shave- 
grasse wherewith Fletchers and Combemakers doe rub and 
polish their work.”J Camerarius§ also represents variegatum. 
The figure in ^ English Botany ’ 1| appears to me to be spoiled 
by an attempt to represent the roughness of the stem, which of 
course cannot be accomplished. That in the ^ Flora Londinen- 
sis ’ H is the most characteristic I have met with. 

The medicinal and other properties of this Equisetmn have 
been amply recorded by the earlier herbalists, but most of them 
appear to quote Galen as their authority. In consequence of 
the confused nomenclature and very indifferent figures of these 
authors, the properties alluded to become very doubtful as in- 
tended for the present species ; and even were they so intended, 
all faith in them, as far as regards medicine, has long been ex- 
ploded. Tragus tells us that it is most useful as a medicine, 
taken internally or externally ; internally its properties are some- 
what astringent : the expressed juice put into the nostrils and 
applied at the same time on the neck, stops bleeding at the

We are told by Lightfoot f that some entertain an opinion 
that if cows chance to feed upon ” this Equisetum their teeth 
will drop out : how far this may be true,” he adds, “ I know 
not, but I am persuaded that the pasture must be very bad where 
they are compelled to eat such food.” Sir William Hooker ap- 
pears to give the plant credit for this injurious quality : he says 
that though while to sheep it proves injurious, and that the 
teeth of cows who eat it soon fall out, it is wholesome for horses.” J 
The stems of this plant have for centuries been used by arti- 
ficers in smoothing the surface of wood, bone, and even metal, 
previously to giving these substances their final polish. This 
employment of the stem was noticed by Gerarde in the passage 
already quoted. Haller § also mentions it as being in his day 
used, in common with other species of Equisetum, to polish 
metal vessels, but speaks of this species as being the roughest

and best. We are further told by Lightfoot that Northum- 
berland the dairy-maids scour their milk-pails with it.” The 
value of this plant for the purpose of smoothing or polishing is 
not, however, merely traditionary, nor, like its medicinal virtues, 
imaginary : it is still used for polishing wood, bone, ivory, and 
various metals, particularly brass ; for this purpose it is import- 
ed, under the name of “ Dutch Rush,” in large quantities, from 
Holland, where it is grown on the banks of canals and on the 
sea ramparts, which are often bound together and consolidated 
by its strong and matted roots. Bundles of this imported Dutch 
Rush are exposed for sale by many London shopkeepers. They 
may be seen at Mr. Woodward’s, Old Compton St., corner of 
Frith St., Soho. 1 find however that a doubt exists with some 
excellent botanists, as to whether the Dutch Rush cultivated in 
Holland is identical with either of our British species. Mr. 
Shepherd, the curator of the Liverpool Botanic Garden, having 
this plant in cultivation, has most kindly supplied me with spe- 
cimens in a recent state. These are of much larger size than 
any British examples of E. hyemale I have yet seen, and pre- 
sent structural characters different from those of 
either of the British plants. The most obvious 
difference is the much greater number of striae, 
amounting in some instances to thirty-two. 

The roots are strong, black and frequently divi- 
ded; therhizoma or underground stem is creeping, 
jointed, branched, and with age extends to a great 
length : at the joints it is solid, but between them 
it is partially hollow, the interior being occasion- 
ally more or less divided by longitudinal septa. 

The stems are generally erect and simple ; when 
divided, the branch is lateral, and issues from the 
main stem immediately below the base of one of 
the sheaths ; a stem has rarely more than a single 
branch : the annexed figure represents a branched 
specimen, for which I am indebted to Dr. Gre- 
ville ; it is from Roslin woods, near Edinburgh.

stem has been divided into six portions, in order to exhibit the 
whole at a single view ; its diameter and length, together with 
the distances between the sheaths, have been faithfully copied. 
The sheaths in the specimen figured are fourteen in number, 
the internodes decreasing in length towards either end. Both 
the internodes and sheaths are striated, the former more strongly 
so : the striae are usually about twenty in luxuriant stems, but 
this number is liable to considerable variation, and appears to 
depend entirely on the size of the stem, always decreasing to- 
wards its attenuated apex. The stems are hollow, and jointed 
or divided by a strong transverse septum at each of the sheaths : 
the striae of the sheaths correspond in number with those of the 
internodes, and they terminate in an equal number of acute and 
elongate, but membranous and deciduous teeth. Under certain 
but unascertained conditions these teeth become setiform and 
persistent, but in general all trace of them is early lost, the up- 
per margin of the sheath exhibiting a regular series of rounded 
divisions, uniform in number with the striaB of the stem. The 
sheath of the catkin is, however, an exception, its teeth being 
invariably persistent when mature : the basal portion of each 
sheath is black, the central part whitish, and the upper part 
again black, but all the sheaths are at first greyish-green, after- 
wards entirely black, and finally of two colours as described. 

Sir Humphrey Davy detected in the stem of this plant an ex- 
traordinary quantity of silex ; it is this substance that commu- 
nicates to the stem the rough and file-like character from which 
it derives its value as an article of commerce. The silex appears 
in the form of minute crystals, arranged with beautiful and per- 
fect regularity. Under the microscope we find these crystals 
forming longitudinal series of elevations on the stem : in the 
furrows between these are numerous cup-shaped depressions, 
at the bottom of each of which is placed a stoma. In the 
volume on Optics in Lardner’s ‘ Cabinet Cyclopedia,’ Dr. Brew- 
ster has recorded that he found each particle of silex to possess 
an axis of double refraction. We are told by botanists that the 
quantity of silex is so great, and the particles so closely set, 
that the whole of the vegetable matter may be removed by ma- 
ceration without destroying the form of the plant. 


ROUGH EQUISETUM.

The catkin is small, dark coloured, apiculate and terminal, or 
rarely lateral, and then very near the apex ; its scales are from 
forty to fifty in number, and each is impressed with two or three 
vertical striae. Before the scales have separated in their approach 
to maturity, these striae are continuous throughout the catkin, 
even entering its terminal apiculus, which, in consequence, as- 
sumes a polyhedral figure : they generally correspond in number 
with the striae of the last internode, thus leading to the suppo- 
sition that the catkin is a metamorphosed portion of the stem. 

Mr. Brichan^' has noticed the occasional presence of a singular 
pile of cones on the stems of this species ; I will describe it in 
his own words. — On the top of many stems of E. hyemale I 
observed a pile of small, dark brown, membranous, elastic, co- 
nical, inverted sheaths, of the same substance as the teeth of the 
sheath which embraces the catkin, increasing in width upwards, 
and so closely embracing each other that the rim only of each 
is seen, except the highest and largest, which gives the top of 
the pile a conical shape. Although scarcely an inch in length, 
it resembles an inverted abortion of the plant. Its lower end 
is at first inserted in the uppermost sheath, and surrounded by 
several small sheaths of a texture similar to its own, and placed 
within each other. It is afterwards quite protruded, and gra- 
dually falls off, leaving a flexuous apex, somewhat like that of 
the catkin, whose formation I am persuaded it precedes. On 
dissecting the top of several stems from which the pile of cones 
seemed but recently to have fallen, I found the germ of the cat- 
kin completely enclosed within its sheath, the teeth of which, 
not yet separate, form by their union the apex which appears 
when the pile falls off. Dissection, however, when the cones 
are present, seems often to discover an abortive germ. The 
number of inverted sheaths in one of these piles is about twelve ; 
what their peculiar function may be I cannot even conjecture.” 

The spores or supposed seeds of Equisetums have long been 
favorite objects with the microscopist. The figures given below 
represent the spores of the present species in various stages of 
development : they are copied from the illustrations to a paper

This plant occurs in the North of Ireland, more particularly 
in the counties Derry and Antrim. Since the publication of 
this species in ^ The Phytologist,’ Dr. Scouler has informed me 
that it was first found by Mr. Whitla in Colin Glen, near Belfast, 
and afterwards in the Deer-park near Glen arm, and was recog- 
nized by that gentleman as a distinct species ; but Mr. Mackay, 
alluding to this discovery in his ‘ Flora Hibcrnica,’ writes thus.

Moist banks near a waterfall, at the upper end of Colin Glen, 
Belfast, where I found it, in company with Mr. F. Whitla, in 
August, 1833.” I gave the substance of this statement in ^The 
Phytologist,’^ and named the plant in honor of Mr. Mackay ; sup- 
posing him the original discoverer of the plant, I thought it a 
compliment justly due to so distinguished a botanist. Since its 
first discovery it has been found by Mr. Moore in many of the 
glens in the North of Ireland, particularly in Ballyharrigan glen 
(Derry), and in the wild deep ravines emphatically called “ The 
Glens ” (Antrim). In Scotland it was first discovered in 1841, 
on the banks and in what is usually the bed of the river ” 
Dee, in Aberdeenshire, by Mr. Brichan ; and I have to acknow- 
ledge the great obligation I am under, both to Mr. Moore and 
Mr. Brichan, for a supply of specimens, recent and dried, so 
that I have had the best possible opportunity for a careful in- 
vestigation and comparison of the plants from the Scotch and 
Irish localities, and have no hesitation in pronouncing them 
identical ; an opinion in which I believe all botanists who have 
compared them fully concur. 

Its discovery caused a multiplicity of correspondence among 
botanists, some maintaining that it was merely an elongate and 
exuberant form of Equisetum variegatum ; others that it was a 
good species, perfectly distinct from any which had been previ- 
ously recorded as British. The matter rested thus until the 
question was referred to Sir W. J. Hooker, and that illustrious 
botanist decided not only in favor of its distinctness as a spe- 
cies, but pronounced it to be the Equisetum elongatum of 
Willdenow, ( see ‘ London Journal of Botany,’ 42, and Phytol. 
174). Feeling as I do the difficulty under which I shall labour 
in venturing to differ from so high an authority as Sir William 
Hooker, I must still record my opinion that the plant before me 
is not identical with the Equis. elongatum of Willdenow't and

that it has verticillate and Q-angled branches, and that the 
sheaths are hoary greeji, concolorous with the internodes : 
I have faithfully transcribed both the descriptions in question. 
Moreover, on consulting Professor Vaucher’s ‘ Monographic des 
Preles,’ published in the first volume of the ‘ Memoires de la 
Societe de Physique, etc. de Geneve,’ I find that learned author 
has not only described at length but figured (PI. VI.) Willdenow’s 
plant under Desfontaine’s prior name of Equisetnm ramosissi- 
mum : the subduplicato-ramose stem and verticillate character 
of the branches, as well as the concolorous sheaths, are well 
represented. Vaucher gives the appropriate name of Equisetum 
multiforme to a species which appears to include the variegatum 
of Schleicher’s Catalogue and various other forms ; among these 
the present plant is not distinctly characterized : his Equise- 
tum multiforme ramosum, which, in other respects, comes the 
nearest, having the sheaths differently coloured. His description 
of this variety is quoted below.f

EQUISETACE^. 


M. Vaucher, in his introductory remarks on the genus, aptly 
cites his Equisetum multiforme as an instance of characteristic 
liability to variation. After mentioning that the Equiseta gene- 
rally occur on the banks of streams and in damp places, as well 
as in the water, he says they are occasionally even met wdth 
in sandy places that are not watery, such is the case with Equi- 
setum multiforme : this species appears strongly influenced by 
the properties of the soil in which it grows, for sometimes it 
throws out but a small number of slender and short branches, 
at other times, on the contrary, and especially when in a more 
fertile soil, we find issuing from the principal stem, branches not 
only much longer but much more divided, so much so indeed 
that it has been thought it could not then be referred to the same 
species.’'^ 

The roots and rhizoma present no characters by which I can 
distinguish this plant from that previously described : in both, 
these parts are black, the roots being tortuous, much divided, 
and often clothed wdth minute and matted fibrillse : the stems 
are very long, generally erect, nearly straight, and jointed as in 
the former species : the figure at p. 25, shows a stem divided into 
six portions, its size and the relative length of the internodes 
having been copied with scrupulous accuracy. Both the inter- 
nodes and sheaths are striated ; the striae vary in number from 
eight to twelve, or even fourteen. The stem is hollo wq with the

exception of the transverse septa occurring at the sheaths. In- 
stead of being uniformly simple, as represented in the figure 
at page 25, it is very frequently spar- 
ingly branched, as shown in the left 
hand figure in the margin ; the branch- 
es rise singly from below one of the 
sheaths, and a stem often bears two or 
three such branches ; the branches 
themselves also occasionally emit other 
branches in the same way, the plant, 
in that case, being very luxuriant, and 
attaining a height of three to four feet : 
the right hand figure in the margin is 
a diagram showing the mode of branch- 
ing. Under the microscope the struc- 
ture of the stem appears precisely 
identical with that of E. hyemale ; the 
double row of elevations on each of 
the ridges, with the cup-shaped depres- 
sions and stomata in the furrows, are 
exactly as I have already described 
them. The sheaths are generally black, 
the central part sometimes white, but 
scarcely ever so distinctly banded as 
in E, hyemale : the teeth are very long, 
flexuous and setiform ; their edges at 
the base are dilated, membranous, somewhat whitish, and nearly 
transparent ; they are usually, but not invariably, persistent. 
The catkin is small, nearly black, apiculate, terminal, and stri- 
ated as in the preceding species : the scales are about thirty in 
number. 

In my history of the British Equiseta published in ^ The 
Phytologist,’ I have treated this and the two following species as 
varieties of E, hyemale : abler botanists than myself, and more 
particularly Mr. Brichan, in an admirable paper in ‘ The Phy- 
tologist,’'^ have courteously but decidedly expressed their disap-

probation of my views ; and I think it well, in a worli like the 
present, to content myself with endeavouring to discriminate 
between the plants described, without making any other at- 
tempt to enforce my views as to the limits of species or varieties, 
than by recording the doubt which I feel on the subject by pre- 
fixing a t to the names of all those species whose distinctness I 
do not at present consider to be clearly proved. 

The stem cut transversely presents a section somewhat dif- 
ferent from that of E. hyemale : the furrow^s are wider, and 
the rows of siliceous particles rather more distant, yet less so 
than in E. variegatum. Magnified sections of all three are 
given in the vignette below : the central figure represents E. 
hyemale^ the right hand figure E. variegatum y and the left hand 
E. Mackaii. The sections were cut from specimens of average 
size, were magnified by the same power, and the outline traced 
by means of a camera lucida, so that the relative sizes of the 
three, as well as their proportions, are accurately preserved. 

Closely allied to the present species, but still to all appearance 
distinct, is the Equisetum ramosum of Schkuhr — the E. multi- 
forme ramosum of Vaucher and Decandolle. It is said by 
Schkuhr to have been found in Wales, but I do not know on 
what authority: it is figured and fully described both by Schkuhr 
and Vaucher, and specimens may be consulted in the herbarium 
of the late Mr. Winch, now in possession of the Linnean Soci- 
ety of London.

This, like the preceding species, is local, occurring generally 
on dry moveable sand in the immediate vicinity of the sea, but 
sometimes in ditches, canals or rivers, when it assumes a some- 
what enlarged and altered appearance. 

In England it occurs at the mouth of the Mersey : I have

repeatedly observed it on New Brighton sands on the Cheshire j 
side, and the Bootle sands on the Lancashire side : it is tolerably I 
abundant also at Southport, in the latter county. In Teesdale ] 
it has been found in several spots, more particularly at Widdy j 
bank, and about Winch-bridge. In Cumberland it is very tall i 
and luxuriant on the banks of the Irthing, above the upper 
stepping-stones at Gilsland. 

In Scotland it was first found by the late Mr. George Don, 
in 1807, on the sands of Barry, near Dundee; it occurs also 
in Rosshire, and in Kincardineshire on the banks and in the 
bed of the Dee, intermixed with the two species I have al- 
ready described. In Ireland it is abundant in several sea-coast 
localities, more particularly at Port Marnock : also in the Dublin 
canal, in a ditch at Mucruss, &c. 

For specimens from these localities, and for much valuable 
information respecting them, I have to acknowledge my best 
thanks to Dr. Greville, Dr. Balfour, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Babington, 
Mr. Gibson, Mr. Brichan, and Mr. Moore of the Dublin Glas- 
nevin garden. 

The nomenclature of this species is involved in great, and I 
fear inextricable, confusion, for although certain plants have fre- 
quently been described under the present name, I feel convinced 
that the same plant, whether it be considered a species or vari- 
ety, has not always been intended ; moreover, Vaucher and De- 
candolle combine the varieties of the present plant with E. 
ramosum and E. campanulatmn (neither of which is yet known 
to be British) under the single specific name of E. multiforme. 
Under these circumstances I adopt the nomenclature of our 
British authors. Sir J. E. Smith and Sir W. J. Hooker, a course 
which I trust will be found convenient until the synonyms shall 
be unravelled by some abler hand than mine. The name of 
variegatum was, it appears, first employed in Schleicher’s Cata- 
logue, but, being unaccompanied by a description, I think we 
are by no means bound to enquire what plant was intended by 
the author, more especially as no satisfactory result could possi- 
bly be attained. The first description which I find is published 
in the ‘Botanical Pocket-book’ for 1807, by Weber and Mohr :

and describing as the a. or normal form a small creeping moun-

name of reptans as having priority, and refers to Weber and 
Mohr, who speak of it as a manuscript name, and assert, that 
having compared Wahlenberg’s specimens of E. reptans with 
Michaux’s specimens of the North- American species, E, scir- 
poides, they find them identical, and consider them distinct from 
their own E. variegatum.^ Beck, however, gives the name of 
E. variegatum to the North American species, E. scirpoides, 
and unhesitatingly pronounces them to be identical ; f and 
Wahlenberg, in his comparatively modern work, the ‘ Flora 
Suecica,’ does not maintain the two varieties which he proposes 
in the ‘ Flora Lapponica,’ but, without expressing a doubt on 
the subject, gives his E. reptans as the species, and quotes the 
E. variegatum of Willdenow and of Smith as synonymous. It 
should, however, be observed that the normal form of E. reptans, 
as originally described by Wahlenberg, is a very small moun- 
tain form, with a quadrangular stem, and having black setiform 
teeth to the sheaths : there are European specimens in the her- 
barium of the late Mr. Winch, now in possession of the Linnean 
Society of London, but I have never seen similar examples from 
any part of Great Britain.

the river E. variegatum of Weber, &c. are certainly indigenous to 
Great Britain, the former being the plant from the sands of 
Barry, New Brighton, &c., and the latter having been found 
by Mr. Johnson, growing on the banks of the canal near Dublin ; 
in several other similar situations, in the same neighbourhood, 
by Mr. Moore ; and in the bed and on the banks of the Dee, in 
Kincardineshire, by Mr, Brichan. The Dublin plant was the 
first of these to claim the attention of botanists, and Mr. Moore, 
after giving the subject every possible attention, gives me his 
views in the following words I have entered into correspon- 
dence with Mr. Wilson respecting the aquatic Equisetum, which 
you take to be a form of E. variegatum^ and wdiich I am con- 
vinced is a perfectly distinct species. Still I admit it is difficult 
to fix on characters to distinguish our aquatic plant from E. va~ 
riegalwn, and I should say the only permanent distinguishing 
marks are the greater size of the former, its different appearance, 
and its habit of growing,but these marks are so constant both in 
a natural and cultivated state that they are worthy of grave con- 
sideration. E. variegatum is a slender creeping plant, its stems 
very decumbent, only rising from the ground near the apex ; 
they never have more than six striae. The aquatic plant is an 
elegant, bold, upright growing species, with the fronds remarka- 
bly straight and stout, and constantly marked with nine or ten 
striae, and although not nearly so much inclined to branch at 
the base, it grows in closer caespitose tufts. Both species retain 
their characters in cultivation, under which I have had them 
growing side by side in peat earth for two years : both are 
thriving remarkably well, and no two species of a genus can 
appear more distinct.” These observations refer to the aquatic 
and sea-shore plants, as growing near Dublin. Mr. Brichan, to 
whom I sent the Dublin canal plant, and to whom we are in- 
debted for such admirable observations on these species, writes 
me as follows : — The Dublin plant, of which you sent me spe- 
cimens, appears to me not only to resemble but to be identical 
with that which grows in the Dee.” I have next to quote a 
comparison, also from the pen of Mr. Brichan, between the semi- 
aquatic and sea-shore plants as growing in Scotland. The sands 
of Barry, Mr, Don’s original locality, and the spot whence we

receive the smallest, most recumbent, and most extreme speci- 
mens, is selected as the field of observation. The roots of 
the Barry plant scarcely differ from those of the Deeside vari- 
ety. The stems are of the same variable length and number of 
articulations, with 4 — 10 striae : they are completely prostrate, 
except in a few instances, when supported by Ammopliila are- 
naria. When not sheltered by that or any other plant, they are 
brownish on the upper or exposed side and green on the under ; 
it is, however, possible that the brown colour may be the effect 
of the lateness of the season. On the upper side also the bands 
of black upon the sheaths run farther down the stem than they 
do on the under side. The teeth are wedge-shaped, not ovate 
as at Banchory : the bristles are longer, and apparently more 
persistent. The catkins are in general more exserted and ma- 
tured, and, as well as the stems, have sometimes a reddish tinge. 
The plant seems to branch in the same manner as in the higher 
and moist situation on Deeside, 150 feet above the sea. When 
the sand is compacted by small plants which afford no shelter to 
the Equisetum, the latter is generally very small, slender and 
filiform ; where the sand is loose or the plant has shelter, its 
growth is much stronger, and in the sheltered situation it is 
greener. In no case does the plant attain the same size as on 
Deeside. Some specimens slightly resemble E. Mackaii, but 
are perfectly distinct ; the resemblance arises from the bristles 
being longer, and the amount of black upon the sheaths greater 
than in the usual state of the plant.”^' It will be seen that these 
opposite opinions concerning the two more usual forms of the 
plant, proceeding as they do from botanists of acknowledged 
judgment, nearly counteract each other, and the question as to 
their distinctness or identity, still remains sub judice. 

The roots and rhizoma, like those of E. Mackaii, present no 
characters by which I can distinguish this species from E. hy~ 
emale. Like the roots of many other plants when growing in 
loose sand, those of the present species are frequently clothed 
with a quantity of matted fibrill 80 : the stems are short, often 
semiprostrate, and the internodes are short and frequently some-

what arcuate, giving the entire stem a sinuous appearance.— 
The figure represents a stout specimen of the New Brighton 
plant ; the four detached stems being portions of rather more 
elongate specimens : both the sheaths and internodes are stri- 
ated : the striae are few in number, six or eight may be taken as 
the average : under a microscope the cuticle precisely resembles 
that of the species already described : the ridges appear 
grooved, being margined on each side with a longitudinal 
series of minute flinty tubercles : in the furrows are two longitu- 
dinal series of stomata placed very near the ridges, indeed so 
near, that in stems dried in an immature state, they are frequently 
partially obscured by the ridges. The lower portion of each 
sheath is generally concolorous with the internode, the upper por- 
tion only being black ; this causes the sheath to appear much 
shorter than in the species previously described : the teeth 
are short, wedge-shaped, and most commonly without the 
setiform apex or bristle which distinguishes the species last 
described : their edges are membranous, occasionally black, as 
represented in the detached stems to the left of the figure, but 
usually white, giving the plant that variegated appearance from 
which its name has probably been derived. The catkin is small, 
apiculate, terminal and striated, as in the two preceding species ; 
its scales are few — from eighteen to twenty-five in number. 

The stem of this species is much less liable to 
become branched than either of the preceding, still 
this branching occasionally occurs : in the margin 
I have represented a New Brighton specimen bear- 
ing a branch ; the black colouring of the sheath 
in this specimen extends much lower than is usual, 
yet the teeth remain wedge-shaped. Specimens 
occasionally occur in the same habitat repeatedly 
branched, and much more luxuriant than the one 
figured at page 31. Of one of these in his own 
herbarium Mr. Wilson has kindly furnished the 
following description. 

“ I have some specimens of E. variegatum from New Brighton, 
opposite Liverpool, which are very much branched and very tall ; 
but even in these I can find only two branches at any one joint. 



38 


EQUISETACE^» 


I will describe one of the best marked of these. Height 22 
inches, of which inches is black, having been buried in the 
ground to that depth, and rather more. At 2j inches, two op- 
posite branches shoot out, with rooted bases. At the next joint 
are two other opposite branches placed at right angles to the 
first pair. At the next joint are two other opposite branches, 
and at the next joint is another opposite pair. The right branch, 
at the seventh joint, has two branches, which are contiguous 
or nearly so (not opposite), and two more at the ninth in the 
same condition ; two opposite ones at the tenth joint, one 
branch having the same direction as the two lower branches. 
In this specimen the main stem is broken off at the height of 
seven inches ; the second primary pair of branches has also one 
branch ramified, but less remarkably so than the one which I 
have already given in detail.” 

The station at Mucruss, in the immediate vicinity of the lakes 
of Killarney, was discovered by Mr. Wilson. He found the 
plant growing in water, perfectly erect, with the stems sometimes 
sparingly branched, but generally simple, and very much resem- 
bling the unbranched form of E. Jluviatile^ which it nearly 
equals in size. Dr. Bromfield, when at Killarney, in the autumn 
of 1842, most kindly endeavoured to obtain for me living plants, 
but failed in finding the station, although directed by Mr. Wil- 
son, so that the plant does not, apparently, exist there in any 
quantity. To Mr. Wilson I am indebted for specimens, accom- 
panied by copious notes and several drawings, from which 
united sources my observations have been compiled. I have 
introduced on the opposite page a figure of portions of two sepa- 
rate stems, the actual size, &c., being preserved. Thinking it 
not improbable that future authors may raise this plant to the 
rank of a species, I beg to propose for it the name of its ener- 
getic and distinguished discoverer ; and though I now merely 
employ the name as distinguishing a variety, I hope that it will 
be preserved should the plant hereafter be adopted as a species. 
The following is the description of a stem which I believe to be 
of average size. Length thirty-eight inches, more than a third 
of which was submerged, and emits numerous roots : it has three 
erect branches, the first is situate nineteen inches below the sum-

mit, and is broken off at a length of four inches ; the second is 
twenty-two inches from the summit, and is six inches in length ; 
the third branch is one inch lower, is nine inches in length, and 
has nineteen joints. The main stem is terminated by a catkin. 



Equisetum variegatum, var. Wilsoni, (natural size). 


The stem of this variety has an average number of ten 
furrows, the ridges between them being broad, as in the usual 
form, but the siliceous particles are far less prominent, so that 
the plant does not partake of that asperity which so eminently

Stem, with which, 


m 



characterizes E. hyemale, E. Mackaiij and the more usual forms 
of E. variegatum^ but has a smoother feel, like that of E, pa- 
lustre, the species immediately following. A transverse section 
of the stem, which is given below, also differs considerably 
from that of the usual plant, as represented by the right hand 
figure at page 30. The sheaths are scarcely larger than the 
dried specimens, they appear perfectly 
concolorous, with the exception of a 
narrow, sinuous, black band, at the sum- 
mit of each. The teeth are very short, 
somewhat wedge-shaped, generally blunt, 
and have obscure membranous margins ; 
but they are so easily injured by car- 
riage, &c., that dried specimens rarely 
exhibit them in perfection : they vary 
with striae from eight to twelve in num- 
ber. As in the usual form, the sheath 
of the catkin is much larger and looser than the rest : its 
teeth are also longer, and their membranous edges dilated and 
conspicuous. The catkin is small, black, terminal, striated and 
apiculate. 

The most striking characters whereby to distinguish the pre- 
sent from the usual form of the species, are its great size, both as 
regards height and stoutness, its erect habit, its aquatic locality, 
and the comparative smoothness of the stem. Mr. Wilson ap- 
pears to attribute the great size and erect habit to its aquatic lo- 
cality, and its greater smoothness to the combined influence of 
water and the soil of the district in which it grows ; and he ex- 
presses to me his unwillingness to admit it as a species. It may 
indeed be urged that the erect aquatic plant from Dublin and 
Kincardineshire is somew^hat intermediate ; indeed Mr. Moore, 
who insists on the distinctness of the Port Marnock and Dublin 
canal plants, identifies the latter with the Mucruss variety : in 
this opinion I cannot concur without additional evidence in its 
support, the very different degree of roughness in the stem being 
alone a sufficient diagnostic. 


EQUISETACE/E. 


41 


I will now recapitulate, in the form of a list, the remarks coii” 
tained in the foregoing pages on the various unbranched forms 
of Equisetum which I have had occasion to mention. 

1. E. hyemale^ Linneus. Sheaths black, wdth a whitish band 
in the middle, terminating in a series of obtuse segments, and 
exhibiting, under a lens, traces of teeth, which appear to have 
been broken off : habit erect : habitat watery places in both 
continents. 

2. E. Mackaii^ Newman = E. elongatum. Hooker. Sheaths 
black throughout, terminating in long, aristate, somewhat flex- 
uous teeth : habit erect : habitat watery places in the north of 
Britain. 

3. E. ramosum, Schkuhr. Sheaths terminating in long, aris- 
tate teeth, concolorous with the internodes : habit erect : habi- 
tat watery places in Europe (and Wales ?) 

4. E. scirpoides, Michaux. Sheaths terminating in three 
setiform teeth : habit prostrate : plant very minute : habitat 
^mong moss, at the roots of trees, in North America. 

5. E. reptans^ a. Wahlenberg. Sheaths terminating in four 
setiform teeth : stem quadrangular : habit prostrate : plant very 
minute : habitat bare mountainous regions in Lapland. 

6. E. arenarium (apparently a MS. name, quoted by Weber 
and Mohr, and doubtless the E. variegatum of Smith). Sheaths 
having the upper portion only black, the lower concolorous with 
the internodes, terminating in obtuse segments, with white mar- 
ginal membranes, occasionally having their apices prolonged 
and setiform : habit prostrate : plant of various sizes ; habitat 
sands of the sea-shore, Barry, Southport, Bootle, New Brighton 
and Port Marnock. 

7. E. campanulatum, Poiret. This appears to differ from 
the preceding only in having the sheaths larger and looser : I 
have not seen it. 

8. E. variegatum^ Weber & Mohr. Sheaths as in No. 6 :

The characters of the sheath and its teeth will not, I fear, fur- { 
nish us with a very safe guide, since I find modifications of the 
same structure obtaining in all the species hitherto described : | 

the ribs of the stem are arranged in proximate pairs, w^hich pass  ! 
into the sheaths, and one pair enters each tooth, generally ter- | 
minating in an obtuse somewhat rounded extremity ; the furrow 
between the ribs constituting the pair, is continued as a black j 
bristle, the margins of which are furnished with a whitish semi- | 
hyaline membrane ; this bristle, together with its marginal mem- 
brane, give an outline to the tooth. The diagrams below repre- | 
sent the outline thus given to the teeth in the three species: — 
the left hand figure represents E. hyemale ; the middle figure 
E. Mackaii ; and the right hand figure E, variegatum. In 
the variety Wilsoni the outline is somewhat more obtuse than in 
the last of these. I have selected for the figures examples in 
which the characters are strongly marked : I believe others may 
be found exactly intermediate.

This species appears to be generally distributed : it occurs in 
all the county lists of ferns which I have received, and is rarely 
mentioned either as local or uncommon. In Ireland I found it 
particularly abundant, especially in the north : in the vicinity 
of the Giant’s Causeway I observed several large patches of 
ground densely covered with it. I have not seen it in such pro- 
fusion elsewhere. 

The old figures usually quoted as representing this plant must 
be received wfith considerable doubt. Those of Gerarde'*^ and 
Lobel,t evidently printed from the same block, represent a plant 
growing in the water, and having one erect and unbranched 
stem, and another branched, and somewhat resembling the pre- 
sent species. Ray’s figurej represents a variety hereafter to be 
noticed. The modern figures of course more nearly resemble 
the plant : that in English Botany is very good. 

Gerarde’s description appears to comprehend more than one 
species, — “the great thicke jointed stalk” describing Eq.Jlu- 
viatile of Linneus, while the roughness and hardness seem inap- 
plicable to that species. I subjoin the passage as it stands in 
the Herbal. “ Water Horse-taile, that growes by the brinks of 
riuers and running streams, and often in the middest of the wa- 
ter, hath a very long root according to the depth of the water, 
grosse thicke and jointed, with some threds anexed thereto : from 
which riseth vp a great thicke jointed stalk, whereon grow long 
rough rushy leaues pyramide or steeple fashion. The whole 
plant is also tough hard and fit to shave and rub woodden things 
as the other.” 

It is not however only in these ante-Linnean works that the 
synonymy of this and the following species is involved in obscu- 
rity. Our modern authors, I regret to say, have hitherto done 
but little towards the elucidation of the nomenclature. In the 
hope of making the subject somewhat more clear, I have 
introduced, in the Appendix, § some observations on the speci- 
mens in the Linnean herbarium. Unfortunately, the Linnean 
characters are frequently obscure, owing to the constant en- 
deavour of their celebrated author to make them as concise

as possible : in such case a reference to the specimen becomes 
indispensable. 

In a plant of which the synonymy is so imperfectly known 
as the Marsh Equisetum^ it is by no means an easy task to trace 
the record of medical and other properties. Haller seems to 
have collected together a number of wise saws from a variety of 
sources, and gives them under his Equisetum No. 1677 : but 
not only do I doubt whether the whole of them were intended 
for any one species, but 1 also doubt whether his No. 1677 is 
confined to the species now under consideration. The point is 
not worth a very rigid scrutiny. He makes out his No. 1677 to 
be hurtful to oxen and cows, giving them diarrhoea and making 
their teeth loose : in the same passage he also speaks of the 
great difficulty of extirpating his No. 1676, which is probably 
E, arvense, from a field where it is once naturalized : of the 
uses of either as a medicine he does not speak with certainty.^' 

The roots are slender and frequently divided ; they appear to 
spring from the joints of the rhizoma, and are generally covered 
with minute fibrillse. The rhizoma is creeping, and extends to 
a great length ; it is of nearly the same diameter as the stem, 
very black and shining, and smooth to the touch : at the joints 
it is solid, but the internodes are more or less hollow. 

The engraving at page 43 of this work represents a stem of 
Marsh Equisetum of the natural size and proportions : in order 
to exhibit the whole at one view, the stem has been divided into 
three portions. The stem is perfectly erect, about fifteen inches 
high, deeply furrowed and finely granulated : the furrows are

eight in number, the granulations of the ridges between them 
feel slightly rough to the nail if drawn along them. The stem 
is divided into eleven compartments by means of transverse 
septa ; the internodes are an inch and a quarter or an inch and 
a half in length : the sheaths occur at the septa, and correspond 
in number ; they considerably exceed the stem in circumference, 
and in consequence are loose : the ridges of the stem enter the 
sheaths, and each then divides into two parallel portions, and 
terminates in one of the teeth, which are eight in number, 
acute, wedge-shaped, tipped with black, and furnished with 
nearly transparent membranous edges. There are nine whorls 
of branches : these rise from the furrows of the stem, close to 
the base of the sheaths ; they never exceed the furrows in num- 
ber, and are frequently fewer; the short sheath at the base of 
each is black, and these form a series of black rings round the 
stem : they are divided into six or eight joints, of which the 
basal and apical are the shortest : they are generally live-ribbed, 
and the sheaths occurring at the joints are five-toothed, each 
tooth receiving one rib, which is always divided before its termi- 
nation, and the divisions do not ascend to the extreme apex of 
the tooth ; the teeth are tipped with brown, and are furnished 
with semi-hyaline marginal membranes : the branches vary 
greatly in length. 

The catkin is long and rather narrow ; when mature it stands 
on a distinct stalk of its own length : it is terminal, and after 
discharging its seeds it appears to perish, the stem and branches 
continuing to retain their vigour. There is no apiculus, the 
extreme summit being composed of a scale similar to the rest : 
at first the scales are crowded together, forming a black mass, 
they afterwards separate, the peduncle supporting each becomes 
visible, and the catkin, increasing in length, assumes a brown 
colour. The catkin appears in May and June. 

This species is subject to extraordinary variations, three of 
which have received distinguishing names. 

The first of these appears to be universally known by the 
name of polystachion : it is at once distinguished by its nume- 
rous catkins : these are usually and principally borne on the two 
upper whorls of branches ; the main stem generally terminating

in a catkin of uniform size witli the others, as rej^resented in the 
figure, which is drawn from an exceedingly beautiful specimen, 
kindly lent me by Miss Griffiths. At other times the stem bears 
a catkin of the normal size and form, while those on the 
branches are comparatively diminutive in size : for specimens 
of the latter form I am indebted to several kind correspondents. 



1 may remark that the catkins in this form of the plant are 
usually small, and in the specimens which have come more 
especially under my notice, they are very black and compact.

much more so than the single apical catkin of the normal form 
of the plant, and hence they much more nearly resemble those 
of the preceding species : in other respects this plant so nearly 
approaches the normal form, that a more minute description ap- 
pears unnecessary. 

It was supposed by Bolton that this variety was caused by the 
primary stem having been bitten off, but Dr. Wood remarks^ that 
in all the specimens he has seen the terminal catkin of the 
main stem was present, thus clearly proving that the proliferous 
condition is not dependant on the accidental circumstance of 
the top of the plant having been cropped or destroyed.” As I 
have never seen the plant without the terminal catkin, I entirely 
agree with this observation. 

The second variety is not so familiar to botanists ; it is, how- 
ever, widely but sparingly distributed. I am indebted to Miss 
Griffiths for specimens from Braun ton Burroughs in Devonshire, 
to Dr, Greville for others from the sands of Barry, and to Mr. S. 
Gibson for the loan of others from Aldingham, Yorkshire, and 
Broadbank, Lancashire. 

This plant, as will be seen from the figure, differs principally 
from the normal form in being without branches, or nearly so, 
the occurrence of a few scattered ones being occasional only, and 
constituting the exception rather than the rule. 1 have little 
doubt of its being the E. palustre y. nudum of Duby and De Can- 
dolle,+ and an intermediate form between this and the usual plant 
is probably the E. palustre i3. alpinum of Sir W. J. Hooker. J 

The specimens vary considerably in size as well as general 
appearance : those from Scotland, Yorkshire and Lancashire, 
are very small, the stems not attaining on the average more than 
a length of two inches : those from Devonshire are somewhat 
larger — the figure on the opposite page represents a Devonshire 
specimen of the natural size, — and I have seen others of a still 
more luxuriant growth. Some of the examples are erect, others 
prostrate, and those which grow on sand banks have the roots

densely fibrous and clothed with minute fibrillse. The small 
size, often prostrate habit, branchless stems, sandy habitat and 
densely clothed roots, have induced many botanists to consider 
this plant a variety of E, variegatmn rather than of E. palustre : 



but after a careful examination I am unable to find any charac- 
ters whereby to distinguish it from the latter ; the root, stem, 
sheaths and catkins, seeming to me nearly identical with those 
of the usual form of the species.

I have introduced on the present page sections of the stem of 
three species of Equisetiim. The left-hand figure represents E. 
palustre ; the middle figure E . Jluviatile ; and the right-hand 
figure E. sylvaticum. Botanists of some eminence have treated 
E. palustre and E. Jluviatile as varieties of the same plant; and 
even the great Linneus suspected this to be the case, although he 
assigned a separate name to each. A glance at the figures will 
be sufficient to convince an enquirer of the fallacy of this hypo- 
thesis, since the discrepancy in this respect is greater between 
E. palustre and E. Jluviatile^ than between any two species I 
shall have occasion to describe. Although a comparison of these 
sections is by no means new, yet I think but little stress has hi- 
therto been laid on its value. I very strongly recommend it to 
the attention of botanists.

ditches, and occasionally in running streams, the roots and a 
portion of the stem being immersed in water. 

Concerning the nomenclature of this plant Sir J. E. Smith 
has led us into an error, which I have lately endeavoured to 
point out and although no one who has investigated the sub- 
ject expresses doubt as to the fact that the species figured on 
the preceding page is the E. Jiuviatile of Linneus, yet several 
eminent botanists prefer adopting Sir J. E. Smith’s nomencla- 
ture to that of Linneus, on the ground that the former is now 
established in this country. Without making any attempt to 
argue the point with these gentlemen, I revert to the Linnean no- 
menclature simply on the ground of its being the highest autho- 
rity: if they could point out that I misapplied the Linnean name 
I should instantly yield, but while they admit that my nomencla- 
ture is also that of Linneus, it does not appear to me that I am at 
liberty to adopt or reject it in accordance with any views of my 
own. Instead therefore of making any attempt to explain \vhy 
I adopt the Linnean nomenclature, and to defend myself for so 
doing, I confine myself to the more simple task of showing that 
it is the Linnean nomenclature which I have adopted. In the 
first place the adjective is certainly descriptive of a 

plant which is always half immersed in water, whether of rivers, 
lakes or ditches ; and, on the contrary, it is altogether unsuited 
to Jiuviatile^ which generally affects dryland, and which 

appears unable to exist in the water. In the second place, the 
description, ^Jrondihus subsimplicihus'^ ox^^stems almost without 
branches J is clearly descriptive of the present plant, but cannot 
be supposed to describe Smith’s jiuviatile^ in which the stems 
are most abundantly branched. In the third place, Linneus 
marks the species as one in his possession ; and, on turning to 
his herbarium, we find four specimens all identical with the 
plant I have figured : and we do not find, either from the evi- 
dence of name, description or specimen, that Linneus had ever 
seen or was aware of the existence of such a plant as the E. 
Jiuviatile of Smith. Moreover, Linneus observ^es in a MS. note 
to his E. Jiuviatile^ Forte mera varietas prioris (palustre) ex 
solo aqu(B profundioris,"" — perhaps a mere variety of E. pa-

lustre growing from the bottom of deeper water : ” — from this it 
is most evident to me that Linneus never contemplated describing 
a plant which seems less partial to water than most of its 
congeners. It further appears that Sir J. E. Smith was perfectly 
aware of the fact I am now endeavouring to establish, for he has 
written in pencil, under the specimens of E. Jluviatile in the 
Linnean herbarium, the word limosum and has added, 
probably at a later period, the word “ eerie. ” It may be 

presumed that he made this discovery subsequently to the pub- 
lication of the ‘ English Flora,’ as we find no mention of the 
identity thus made out. Lastly, and it may possibly have some 
weight with those who desire the establishment of a uniform 
nomenclature, I may add that the present plant is the E. fluvi- 
atile of the ^ Flora Danica,’ * of Wahlenberg’s ‘ Flora Lappo- 
nica’t and ^ Flora Suecica,’ J and of Dr. Dietrich’s lately 
published work on the Cryptogamia of Germany, § Wahlen- 
berg has taken great pains clearly to point out the error of 
vSmith’s nomenclature, and tells us that the species now under 
consideration is named Jluviatile in all the old Swedish herba- 
ria ; and he more particularly alludes to that of Zeirvogelius, 
the companion of Linneus in his Gothland journey, as one of 
the highest authority ; and he remarks that Smith’s Jluviatile., 
the E. Telmatem of Ehrhart, never grows in rivers, neither has 
it ever been found in Sweden or Lapland, in both which coun- 
tries the present species is most abundant. 

The medicinal properties of this plant have been so variously 
stated that they appear to contradict each other. With regard 
to its economical uses Linneus gives us, in his ‘ Flora Suecica,’ 
a very definite statement that in Sweden it is cut up as food for 
cattle, in order that the cows may give more milk ; || and in 
his ‘Lachesis Lapponica’ he observes that “the rein-deer fed with

evident avidity on the great water horse-tail {Equisetum Jluvla- 
tile), which the Laplanders call Aske^ though it was in a dry 
state, and though they will not eat common hay. How unac- 
countably negligent” he continues, “are the Laplanders, not to 
collect in the course of summer a stock of this plant, and of the 
rein-deer moss {Lichen rangiferinus)^ for winter fodder ! They 
would then have some provision for the herd, when the country 
is covered with an impenetrable crust of frozen snow, and not 
hazard the loss of all they are worth in the world.”^ There 
seems to be very contradictory evidence, even within the range 
of our more immediate observation, as to its being eaten by 
horses, cows and sheep. I have seen it growing luxuriantly in 
ponds in Herefordshire, in situations accessible to cattle, but I 
never could perceive that a stem had been eaten ; but more re- 
cently, in the ditches which intersect the rich pasture land in 
the Isle of Hogs, I observed that nearly every stem within reach 
from the bank had been cropped at a nearly uniform height : 
horses, horned cattle and sheep, are constantly feeding in these 
meadows. We learn from the following passage, extracted from 
Mr. Knapp’s amusing ‘ Journal, ’t that this Equisetum is a favo- 
rite food of the common water-rat, [Arvicola arjiphihia). “ A 
large stagnant piece of water in an inland county, with which I 
was intimately acquainted, and which I very frequently visited 
for many years of my life, was one summer suddenly infested 
with an astonishing number of the short -tailed water-rat, none 
of which had previously existed there. Its vegetation was the 
common products of such places, excepting that the larger por- 
tion of it was densely covered with its usual crop, the smooth 
horsetail [^Equisetum Jiuviatile~\. This constituted the food of

the creatures, and the noise made by their champing it we could 
distinctly hear in the evening at many yards’ distance.” 

The roots of the water Equisetum are numerous, black, fi- 
brous and sinuous : they spring from the bases of the submerged 
sheaths in a manner precisely similar to that of the branches, 
and those which originate near the surface of the water not un- 
frequently ascend for a time in the same way. The rhizoma is 
creeping, and extends horizontally in every direction, forming a 
matted mass in the mud of ponds and ditches where the plant 
occurs : it is of a brown colour, with jet black sheaths, which 
are rather more approximate than in ascending stems, but in 
other respects scarcely different. In winter, when the exposed 
portion of the stem of the preceding year is dead, the remain- 
ing portion becomes prostrate on the mud, still however re- 
taining some of its lower branches, which may be seen in the 
summer in a state of incipient development : these, together with 
others in a still younger state, form the ascending stems of the 
ensuing year. 

The engraving at page 51 represents a moderately sized stem 
of the water Equisetum, of its natural size and proportions : one 
much larger might have been selected, but its representation 
would have been more difficult. The stem is perfectly erect, and 
about twenty-five inches in height, of which seventeen inches were 
above water, and the remainder submerged. The submerged 
portion is smooth, the apical portion slightly striated, (the striae 
are much more distinct in immature and barren stems) : its ave- 
rage diameter is a quarter of an inch : it is divided by transverse 
septa into thirty compartments, thirteen of which were above, and 
the remainder below the surface of the water : the internodes 
above water vary from three quarters of an inch to an inch and 
three quarters in length ; those submerged are much more 
crowded. The sheaths are about a quarter of an inch in length ; 
they are green, concolorous with the stem, and of nearly equal 
diameter, so that they clasp it very tightly : the teeth are sixteen 
to twenty in number, sharp-pointed, always distinctly separated, 
black or dark brown, and not unfrequently furnished with a very 
slender, white, membranous edge. There are six whorls of 
ascending branches : these rise from the base of the sheaths from 


56 


EQUISETACE.E. 


the second to the seventh internode inclusive. The branches in 
each whorl vary from five to seventeen in number : they are di- 
vided into joints, varying from five to ten in number, and have 
from five to eight striae, with corresponding ridges. Each of 
these ridges becomes double or divided on entering the sheath, 
but the two portions are again united before terminating in the 
extreme points of the brown-tipped teeth : the internodes of 
these branches are extremely variable in length, the first and 
last being the shortest : the branches also vary greatly in length. 

The catkin is short, ovate, gibbous and terminal ; and the 
stalk on which it stands is short, scarcely exceeding in length 
the sheath which encloses it. I can discover no apiculus, the 
extreme summit being composed of scales similar to the rest : 
these are generally more than a hundred in number ; externally 
they are quite black, but as they separate about Midsummer, by 
the ripening of the catkin, a common receptacle of ivory white- 
ness is disclosed. 

This species is extremely subject to variation, so much so 
that the preceding description will only suffice to give a general 
idea of a fertile stem. Some are entirely unbranched, others 
sparingly branched, and others again more numerously branched : 
the site of the branches also varies, commencing variously at the 
second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh sheath, and forming 
two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight whorls. When quite 
imbranched, whether fertile or barren, I have no doubt that it is 
the ^Equisetum nudum Icevius nostras'' of Ray,^' the habitat, fi- 
gure, &c., closely corresponding; this form is also the E. limosum 
of Linneus, who, in his ‘ Sy sterna Vegetabilium,’ quotes Ray’s 
description and figure ; but it should also be observed that sub- 
sequently, in his ‘ Flora Lapponica,’ he omits all notice what- 
ever of this unbranched form, apparently not considering it 
worthy of a place even as a variety. The fertile stem occasionally 
becomes proliferous, as in the preceding species, but much more 
rarely. Mr. Luxford possesses a specimen of this kind, found 
in a mill-pool, by the Bristol-road, Birmingham ; and in Sir J. 
E. Smith’s herbarium is a Swiss specimen from Mr. Davall, as

recorded in the ‘ English Flora, but the author remarks that 
he has seen no such variety in England. 

The barren stem is much longer than the fertile, and varies 
in an infinity of ways : among a few which I have lately gathered 
in the ditches of the Isle of Dogs, where this plant abounds, 
but can scarcely be said to flourish, I select the following as 
instances of variation. 

A — is forty-three inches in length, and has thirty-seven joints, 
without a single branch. 

B — is forty-five inches in length, and has forty joints : from the 
first to the nineteenth inclusive these are branchless, the twentieth 
has one branch, the twenty-first two branches, the twenty-second 
two, twenty-third to the fortieth inclusive one branch each. 

C — is forty-five inches in length, and has forty joints : these, 
from the first to the fifteenth inclusive are branchless, the six- 
teenth has one branch, the seventeenth has two branches, the 
eighteenth thirteen, the nineteenth eleven, the twentieth nine, the 
twenty-first nine, the twenty-second ten, the twenty-third ten, the 
twenty-fourth seven, the twenty-fifth eight, the twenty-sixth 
two, the twenty-seventh two, the twenty-eighth two, the twenty- 
ninth one, the thirtieth three, the thirty-first none, the thirty- 
second two, the thirty-third none, the thirty-fourth one, the 
thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth none, the thirty-seventh two, the 
thirty-eighth two, and the thirty-ninth and fortieth none. 

D — is forty inches in length, and has thirty- eight joints : from 
the first to the sixteenth inclusive, and also the eighteenth, twenty- 
fourth, twenty-seventh, twenty-ninth, thirty-first, thirty- third, 
thirty-fifth, thirty-sixth and thirty-eighth are branchless ; the 
seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-first, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, 
twenty-sixth, twenty-eighth, thirtieth, thirty-second, thirty-fourth 
and thirty- seventh have one branch each, the twentieth has two 
branches, and the twenty-second three branches. 

It should also be observed that stems, which at first are per- 
fectly unbranched, often throw out a few scattered branches 
as the season advances, so that it is almost impossible to lay 
down any formula of branching that shall be at all constant. 

^ English Flora, iv, 326.

EQTJISETACEiE. 


In barren stems the apical joints appear to be invariably 
branchless and very much attenuated, w^hile the median and 
lower joints are generally more or less branched : the inferior 
branches, especially when their insertion is submerged, are 
much stouter than the superior ones, and are often furnished 
with whorls of branches, like the main stems. 

In the vignette below I have attempted to represent the natu-

WOOD EQUISETUM [natural size.) 
Equisetum sylvaticum, Linneus. 


This plant, although local, is very widely distributed, occur- 
ring in moist shady woods throughout the kingdom. It grows 
in woods in the Hampstead and Highgate district : I am indebted 
to Mr. Pamplin for specimens gathered at the latter place, and

it is remarkable that it was observed there as long since as the 
time of Lobel, who records the habitat in his ‘ Illustrationes Stir- 
pium/* published in 1655, disguising the English appellation 
of ^ Highgate,’ under the scientific term of ^ Alice Fortce? The 
other English habitats with which I have been furnished through 
the kindness of correspondents, are so numerous that a mere list 
of them would exceed the space 1 can afford for localities. In 
Wales it occurs in many localities, particularly at Hafod, and 
near the Devil’s bridge, in deep shaded ravines, occasionally 
straggling into open and exposed places, but then partially di- 
vested of its characteristic elegance. In Scotland, I observed it 
growing with peculiar luxuriance in the vicinity of Loch Fyne, 
in a little fir-wood on a hill side. The fructification had entirely 
disappeared, and each stem had attained its full development, 
and every pendulous branch its full length and elegance. Al- 
together I could have fancied it a magic scene, created by the 
fairies for their especial use and pleasure, and sacred to the 
solemnization of their moon-lit revels. It was a forest in minia- 
ture, and a forest of surpassing beauty. It is impossible to give 
any adequate idea of such a scene, either by language or illus- 
tration. In Ireland I observed it in the counties Wicklow, An- 
trim, Londonderry and Donegal ; and Mr. Mackay appears to 
consider it of common occurrence in moist woods and hedge- 
banks, particularly in mountainous situations : Dr. Balfour has 
kindly supplied me with specimens of a peculiarly dwarf growth 
and rigid habit, which he found near Oughterard, in Cunnemara. 

The figures of this plant are for the most part characteristic, 
although some of the older ones might have been more satisfac- 
tory. It is so distinct in its appearance and characters that one 
can hardly fail of recognizing it if drawn with even a moderate 
degree of accuracy. For the same reason all authors appear to 
agree in its name, and we thus escape the trouble of investigat- 
ing a confused synonymy. 

The roots of the Wood Equisetum are fewer in number and 
somewhat smaller than those of the species already described : 
they are brown, tortuous, occasionally branched, and generally 


Ulus. Stirp. 149.

(Jl 


clothed with fibnlloe : the rhizoma is horizontally extended, 
branched and striated ; in many places it is clothed with fibrillse 
like those of the roots : it is throughout of a dark brown colour. 

The stems are of two kinds, fertile and barren : both, when 
mature, are usually furnished with compound branches. The 
fertile stems rise from the ground perfectly naked, but most of 
them soon exhibit incipient branches just at the base of the 
upper sheaths ; these quickly elongate into compound branches, 
forming several whorls : a few of the stems remain unbranched, 
and quickly disappear. The number of whorls varies from two 
to eight ; I have rarely met with the latter number, and never 
with more. Long after the catkin has decayed, these whorls of 
branches continue vigorous for a short time, and combine in 
giving a blunt appearance to the entire frond. The stems are of a 
dull, sickly, green colour, succulent and striated : the striae are 
about twelve or fourteen in number, and the ridges between 
them are armed with minute siliceous points, but these are in- 
sufficient to communicate much roughness or harshness to the 
plant. The sheaths are very long and loose, terminating supe- 
riorly in three or four large conical lobes, containing on an ave- 
rage three striae in each; the inferior portion of these sheaths is 
concolorous with the stem, the superior or apical portion is of a 
bright russet brown colour. 

The catkin is elongate, somewhat pointed, and of a pale brown 
colour ; it stands on a slender stalk, of rather more than its own 
length. The scales of the catkin are eighty and upwards in 
number. The catkin is ripe in April. 

The barren stems are about eighteen inches in length, and 
make their appearance almost simultaneously with the fertile 
ones, but are more slender, and the sheaths are much smaller, al- 
though similarly formed and coloured. The whorls of branches 
are from ten to twenty in number, and the branches composing- 
each whorl gradually decrease in number and length towards the 
apex, which is extremely slender, so much so, that unable to 
bear its own weight, it droops on one side, and is not readily 
to be distinguished from the surrounding branches. The striae are 
more distinct than in the fertile stem ; three or four of the ridges 
run into each of the lobes of the sheaths, and unite in its apex.

The branches are very^slender, long, and drooping ; they are 
commonly divided into twelve or fourteen joints, of which those 
near the apex are the shortest, and the basal one is generally 
rather shorter than those immediately following it, which are the 
longest of all, and emit from near their extremities other slen- 
der, long, and drooping branches. The ultimate branches are 
generally triangular or three-ribbed, each joint terminating in 
three long pointed teeth, which are nearly concolorous with the 
branches, and one of the ribs ascends undivided to the extreme 
apex of each tooth. The figure below" represents a barren stem.

leys almost to the sources of those rivers.”^' Dr. Greville, who 
has obligingly supplied me with specimens, has since disco- 
vered it in woods near Forfar ; and Dr. Balfour, to whom I am 
also indebted for specimens, has supplied me with the following 
list of Scotch localities : — “ Woodcockdale wood, near Linlith- 
gow ; in woods at Castle Campbell, near Dollar ; in a wood 
at Carlochar glen ; head of Glen Isla ; in Campsie glen and 
Finglen, near Glasgow ; in woods near Corra Lin, Lanarkshire ; 
in woods near Dunfermline ; and in woods at Auchindenny, near 
Edinburgh.” 

This species has also been found in Ireland. Mr. Moore, of 
the Glasnevin Botanic Garden, says, I suppose this species is 
not unfrequent in the county Antrim, on the sides of mountain 
glens where the geological formation is similar to that at Wolf- 
hill, viz. lias mixed with hardened chalk, but of this I am not 
exactly sure : the only place where I have collected specimens 
was a deep mountain glen near Cushendall, called Glendoon : 
I took it for a variety of E. sylvaticum, not being then ac- 
quainted with the species ; but on comparing the specimens with 
those picked at Wolf-hill,” the residence of William Thompson, 
Esq., and the original Irish locality, I found them identical, 
and it strikes me forcibly that I have passed it over in several 
other glens.” 

I am not aware of its having hitherto been recorded as inha- 
biting England or Wales, but Mr. Woodward’s herbarium con- 
tains a fine specimen gathered by Dr. Forbes Young in a moist 
wood near Mere dough, by Manchester ; and I have no doubt 
that when the attention of botanists is once called to the sub- 
ject, it will be found abundantly in all the moist woods of our 
northern counties. 

This species is described by Willdenow, Decandolle, Yau- 
cher, Dietrich, and other authors, as E. umhrosujn, and by Sir 
William Hooker and Mr. Babington as E. Erummondii. It is 
well figured by Vaucherf in all its states ; the figure in ‘ Eng-

lish Botany ’ ^ represents the fertile and barren steins correctly, 
but neither in the figure nor description do I obserYe any 
reference to the combination of fruit and branches on the same 
stem. Dietrich’s figuref has fruit and branches on one stem, 
but neither separate. 

The roots and rhizoma precisely resemble those of the pre- 
ceding species, the former being small, fibrous, sinuous, often 
divided, and black ; the latter dark brown and striated, and ex- 
tending horizontally. 

The stems are of three kinds ” Jirst, bearing fructification 
only ; secondly^ bearing fructification and branches ; and thirdly 
bearing branches only. The fertile stems are four to six inches 
in height, slightly striated when living, more evidently so when 
dried ; they are of a pale whitish-green colour : the sheaths are 
very large and loose, and nearly white, in some specimens al- 
most of an ivory whiteness, with a brown ring at the base of 
the teeth, which are from fifteen to twenty in number, long, al- 
most setiform, ver'y slightly flexuous, pale brown, and furnished 
with dilated, membranous, almost transparent, whitish margins. 
The catkin is terminal, oval, and of a very pale brown colour ; at 
first it appears sessile, but when mature its footstalk is very 
obvious : the scales are forty or fifty in number ; in figure they 
are somewhat hexagonal, and have a conspicuous central depres- 
sion, surrounded by six or seven nearly circular and slightly 
convex compartments. The catkin is ripe in April. 

When the stem bears both fructification and branches, a cha- 
racter overlooked by British botanists in their descriptions, but 
one of common though not constant occurrence, the branches 
are disposed in whorls four to six in number, the first being 
placed at the base of the uppermost sheath, and the others fol- 
lowing in succession : the sheaths are smaller than in those 
stems which are fertile only, and larger than in the barren stems. 
I am indebted to Mr. Cameron, of the Birmingham Botanic Gar- 
den, for specimens in this state, gathered while the catkin was 
still in perfection.

The barren differs from the exclusively fertile stem in having 
the sheaths much smaller and more distant ; the teeth also are 
shorter, fewer in number, and less pointed. The barren stem 
is generally about eighteen inches in length, and is usually divided 
into about twenty joints, of which the four or five lower ones are 
branchless, but each of the others is furnished with a whorl of 
branches varying in number from ten to sixteen in each whorl. 
These branches at first are somewhat recurved and drooping, as 
in E. sylvaticmn, but they afterwards become spreading and 
slightly ascending ; they are simple, and composed of eight or 
ten joints, of which the basal one is the shortest, being a mere 
sheath ; the second is sinuous : they are usually three-ribbed, 
and the loose sheath which accompanies each joint terminates 
in three obtuse teeth, which have the extreme tips brownish ; 
the ribs become diffused, and their integrity lost, before reaching 
the extremities of the teeth. The ridges of the stem and 
branches are beset with siliceous points, which give the plant a 
rougher feel than the preceding. 

Sir W. J. Hooker observes — Its nearest affinity is doubtless 
with E. arvense, but it is abundantly distinct. Its colour is 
greener and less glaucous ; its stem rougher, with closely-set 
raised points ; its angles and branches much more numerous ; 
and the whole barren frond is singularly blunt in its outline or 
circumscription at the extremity, by which it may be at once 
known from E. arvense. The sheaths, though paler at the base, 
have blacker and more prominent ribs upwards, and they are 
so close as almost to imbricate each other. The teeth are also 
more numerous, when they separate into their proper number.”^ 

I quite agree with this profound botanist in considering the 
present species abundantly distinct from E. arvense; indeed the 
similarity to that plant does not appear to me particularly ob- 
vious : my idea of what would be termed “its affinities” will 
perhaps be sufficiently expressed by my placing it between E. 
si/lvaticum and E. Telmateia.

Scotland and Wales, and Mr. Mackay observes that it is frequent 
in Ireland. It is apparently common on the continent of Eu- 
rope, but does not reach the extreme north, not being mentioned 
by Linneus or Wahlenberg as inhabiting Lapland or Sweden. 

Although so common a plant, much difference of opinion ap- 
pears to prevail respecting the degree of moisture required for 
its nutriment. Smith very decidedly says, “ watery places by 
the sides of rivers and lakes ; ” Withering “ marshy and watery 
places, sides of rivers, ditches, pools and lakes ; ” and Mackay, 
in the ‘Flora Hibernica,’ “muddy lakes, sides of rivers and 
pools, frequent.” When lately proposing, in ‘ The Phytologist,’ 
the change of name for this plant which I have now adopted, I 
expressed an opinion that its choice of habitat by no means fa- 
vored the name Jluviatile, previously applied to it, since it was 
generally found in “ loose gravelly and sandy places, uncon- 
nected with water.” When this was written I was not aware of 
a passage in Mr. Francis’s ‘ Analysis of British Ferns,’ to which 
Mr. Gibson has since called the attention of botanists, and which 
bears directly on the point under consideration ; it is as follows. 
“ The name Jiuviatile is not so applicable to this species as it 
would have been to some others ; it is rarely found on the banks 
of rivers or ponds, nor do I remember ever having seen it grow- 
ing in the water. It rather affects strong, loamy, damp ground, 
clayey banks and swampy bogs.”* Mr. H. C. Watson, in a suc- 
ceeding number of ‘ The Phytologist,’ f objects to my view of 
the subject, and observes, “ The finest examples that I have met 
with were in the counties of Chester and Lancaster, growing on 
the red marl by the sides of streams, or in water with a deep 
muddy bottom : indeed it is a notion among the rustics of Che- 
shire, that horses get ‘ bogged ’ by their endeavours to graze on 
this plant in the muddy pools of that county ; and I have cer- 
tainly seen a horse almost over-head in mud in a small pond 
filled with the tall ‘ horse-tails,’ which is the name given more 
particularly to the barren fronds of the present species.” Mr. 
Watson’s remarks elicited several replies. Mr. Gibson’s was 
the first of these : he states, “ Water or mud is not essential to

the growth of Equiselum Jhiviatile [of Smith]. At Broadbank, 
four miles from Coin, in Lancashire, in a plot of ground which 
is appropriated to the growth of potatoes, we have the plant 
growing much higher than the fences. At Midge Hool, near 
I Todmorden, we have it growing very fine in a wood. I have 
been in the habit of visiting the ponds in Lancashire for the last 
sixteen years, and never met with it in any of them.”^*'^ Mr. 

I Luxford, in his ^ Reigate Flora,’ records a habitat of this plant 
j in these words, “ On Reigate hill, south side of Wray lane, far 
from any water.”f In ^ The Phytologist,’ he further explains 
that the site is a high mound of loose sandy rubbish which had 
accumulated at the entrance of a quarry ; and adds, About the 
year 1836, when I visited Reigate after a few year’s absence, I 
found this mound covered with a most luxuriant crop of Equi- 
setum Jliiviatile [of Smith]. ^ The locality is a very 

dry one ; the nearest water is the large pond in Gatton park, 
and that is quite half a mile distant.”]: Mr. Ilott having previ- 

ously recorded, in ‘ The Phytologist,’ a habitat for this species, at 
Norwood, makes the following observation on the mooted point. 
It was growing most plentifully on the steep bank, but much 
more sparingly on the small piece of wet ground between that 
and the pond, yet a few stems were found close to the water’s 
edge. There was not, however, a single specimen that actually 
grew in the water. It is worthy of remark, too, that by far the 
most luxuriant specimens were those which grew on the bank, 
those about the pond being much more stunted in appearance.”§ 
Mr. Sidebotham says, “ About Manchester it is one of our very 
common plants, growing in woods, meadows, and moist gravelly 
banks, but I never yet met with it growing in ivater. The 
nearest approach to the latter habitat is in the wood below Ar- 
den-hall, Cheshire, where it flourishes in a swamp to the height 
of six or seven feet.”l| 

The more closely I investigate the subject the more do I feel 
strengthened in my original vdew of the case, confessing, how- 
ever, that my means of judging are confined to two or three

localities, of which I select that at Norwood, recorded hy Mr. 
llott, as the easiest of reference. The site is the brow of the 
hill below ‘ The Woodman ’ public-house at Norwood, on the 
road towards Dulwich ; the ground is partially waste, having 
apparently been excavated for brick-earth, and is sufficiently 
moist for little pools of water to collect in the hollows ; partially, 
however, it is cultivated, there being now (August, 1843) a fine 
crop of wheat ready for the sickle. The Equisetum is abun- 
dantly mixed with the wheat in every direction as far as I could 
see, but its growth is not luxuriant, few of its stems attaining 
half the height of the wheat, and many falling very far short of 
even that stature. While this fact, however, proves that it will 
grow in soil sufficiently dry to produce good wheat, its dimi- 
nished size affords little evidence on either side, for the constant 
disturbing of the roots in arable land produces an equally di- 
minishing effect on E. arvense, the stems in the hedges, where 
the roots remain untouched, often attaining a magnitude four 
times as great as those in the adjacent fields. On the unculti- 
vated land the most luxuriant growth, measuring four feet and a 
half or five feet in height, was on the banks wffiere all parts of 
the plant are comparatively free from being disturbed, and the 
soil loose, loamy and crumbling ; but the approach to the little 
pools, as well as to exposed dry and trodden parts, was marked by 
a gradual decrease in the size of the plant, until, in the immediate 
vicinity of the water and trodden paths, the stems were perfect 
pigmies, scarcely four inches in height, thus inducing the conclu- 
sion that, in this locality, water is prejudicial, if not fatal, to the 
existence of the plant, and that closeness and compactness of 
soil is very unfavorable ; a more extensive record of observations 
is still to be desired. 

It is hinted by Haller that the Roman people ate this plant, 
but the passage is so brief as to throw little light on the subject.* 

Considerable difference of opinion appears to prevail on the 
subject of its being eaten by animals. Mr. Watson, in the pas- 
sage above cited, states that horses graze on it. Mr. Gibson

says that horses will not eat the plant at all if they can get any- 
thing else. On the occasion of my first visit to the Norwood 
station, there were three half-starved cadger’s horses on the waste 
ground where the Equisetum is growing : they devoured eagerly 
the coarse sour herbage growing about the pond, and almost 
every green leaf they could find ; indeed it seemed as though 
they seldom had an opportunity of making a meal, but they per- 
tinaciously refused to touch the Equisetum. 

The representations of this plant generally fail to give a correct 
idea of its figure, from the circumstance that the summit of the 
stem is alone given ; in other respects those in ‘ English Bo- 
j tany,’* ** Bolton’s Filices,’t and Dietrich’s ' Cryptogamia of Ger- 
I many,I are tolerably correct. 

It has already been shown that the nomenclature of this spe- 
cies is somewhat confused, but I trust that botanists generally 
will agree with me in restoring the earliest (binominal) name. 
There is little doubt of its being the E. majus of Bay§ and of 
Gerarde,|| the E. Telmateia of Ehrhart,H the E, ehurneum of 
Roth,^* who himself acknowledges it to be Ehrhart’s E. Tel- 
mateia^ and, finally, the E. Jiuviatile of Smith, Hooker and 
Babington, and of many continental botanists, but I think not 
of Hudson’s ^ Flora Anglica,’ as cited by Mr. Babington, who, 
in his zeal to ^‘prevent confusion,” has, I fear, indiscreetly ad- 
ded to the confusion already existing.ft Hudson does not seem 
to have known the plant now under consideration. It also ap- 
pears clear that it was totally unknown to Linneus, and, conse- 
quently, neither named nor alluded to in any of his works. 
The names given by Ray, Gerarde, and other authors antece- 
dent to Linneus, being dropped by universal consent, we una- 
voidably arrive at Ehrhart’s name of Telmateia, published fifty- 
five years ago. Ehrhart’s names were never, I believe, intended 
by their author as specific names, and, moreover, have been re- 
jected as fanciful by many of our later botanists ; but the latter 
objection scarcely holds good in any instance, and certainly not

in the present, for the Greek word T£>,fA,aT£iog, signifying ‘growing 
in mud,’ is less fanciful, as applied to the present species, than 
the Latin word Jluviatile, or ‘ growing in rivers.’ Moreover, 
the former objection is overruled, in the instance before us, 
by Ehrhart’s name having been employed in the ‘ Flora Da- 
nica,’* a work of acknowledged authority ; by Hoffmans, in 
his ‘ Deutschlands Flora ;’f and recently by Dietrich, as quoted 
above. I may also add that it is acknowledged as authority by 
Wahlenberg, than whom we have no more careful or pains- 
taking nomenclaturist. 

The roots and rhizoma present no peculiar characters ; the 
latter is generally of an ebony blackness, and seems to spread 
with considerable rapidity, so that w^hen once introduced a large 
patch is soon formed. 

The stems are of three kinds, as in the preceding species ; 
Jlrst, bearing fructification only ; secondly, bearing fructification 
and branches ; and thirdly, bearing branches only. The exclu- 
sively fertile stems come up in March, shed their seed in April, 
and disappear in May : at page 67 one of these is represented 
of the natural size and proportions, and has been divided for 
more convenient representation : it is nine inches in length, and 
has six joints, several shorter and subterranean ones having 
served to unite it with the rhizoma. I have, in some instances, 
found the total number of joints to be fifteen ; the stem, scarcely 
observable, owing to the great length of the sheaths, is pale 
brown, smooth and succulent. The sheaths are very large, loose 
and spreading towards the summit, distinctly striated, and ter- 
minate in from thirty to forty long, slightly flexuous, setiform 
teeth : the sheaths at the base are pale brown, but are much 
darker towards the summit. The catkin is about two inches 
and a half in length, and eventually an inch and a half in cir- 
cumference : the scales are very numerous, often reaching four 
hundred in number ; they are arranged in w horls, of which the 
lower ones are always sufficiently obvious.

When the stem bears both fructification and branches, it is 
seldom in perfection until the month of August : such stems are 
far less numerous than in either of the preceding species, and 
bear but a small proportion to those which are exclusively fer- 
tile or exclusively barren : the catkin is much smaller than under 
ordinary circumstances : the stem also is smaller, although 
having longer joints ; the sheaths are shorter, less spreading, and 
of a pale green colour; the branches are placed on the second 
to the ninth or tenth joint, counting from the catkin ; in all the 
specimens I have seen they are ascending. Several botanists 
attribute this state of the plant to drought, and Mr. Francis 
observes that it may be produced at any time with such culti- 
vated plants as grow in pots, merely by removing the pots from 
the watery situations in which they are usually placed into a 
drier spot of ground. Mr. W. Wilson ” he continues, “ attri- 
butes this state of the plant to drought, as here stated, and adds 
that he has seen a specimen, gathered near Bangor, where this 
catkin was topped by a prolongation of the branched frond.”* 

The barren stem is much larger than in any other species of 
Equisetum with which I am acquainted : it occasionally attains 
a height of seven feet, and a circumference of more than two 
inches ; its outline and proportions are shown, on a very reduced 
scale, at page 76, fig. a, and one of the internodes, with its ac- 
companying sheaths, is represented of the natural size at fig. h. 

The following is the description of a living stem now before 
me, and of the average size. The entire length above ground, 
and including the ascending branches, is fifty-four inches ; the 
circumference, at twelve inches from the ground, is an inch and 
a half, but decreases upwards until it becomes extremely slen- 
der, terminating almost in a point. The surface of the stem is 
perfectly without ridges or furrows : the number of joints is 
forty : the colour of the internodes is white, with the slightest 
tinge of green, but those on the lower part of the stem often 
change to intense black : the black makes its first appearance in 
spots or blotches, giving the stem a singularly variegated ap- 
pearance ; but it rapidly spreads, and finally entirely occupies all

EQUISETACE.E. 


the lower internodes. The sheaths at the stouter parts of the 
stem are fully half an inch in length, and the teeth are as much 
more : the former have about thirty-two deep and distinct striae, 
which are furnished with rows of siliceous particles at their ed- 
ges ; the spaces between the striae have broad shallow furrows. 
The teeth are slender, setiform, closely appressed to the stem, 
frequently adhering at the summit in twos and threes, and fur- 
nished with dilated, semi-membranous, somewhat ragged edges 
at the base. The sheaths are pale green, with a distinct black- 
ish ring at the summit ; the teeth are black, with the membra- 
nous edges brown, and, in the lower sheaths, often clothed with 
a brown, byssoid pubescence. Each of the joints, with the ex- 
ception of five forming a slender apiculus at the summit, and 
six nearest the ground, is furnished at the base of its accompa- 
nying sheath with a whorl of slender branches : those of the 
lower sheaths are short and recurved, while those near the sum- 
mit are nine inches in length, and nearly erect : the varied di- 
rection of the branches is shown at fig. a. The number of 
branches in a whorl is very various : the respective numbers, 
counting from the summit, are these — five, six, seven, eight, nine, 
ten, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty- 
five, twenty-nine, thirty-three, repeated eleven times, thirty, 
twenty-eight, and sixteen, making a total of six hundred and 
seventy-eight. The colour of the branches is a delicate green, 
so beautiful as to attract the eye at a considerable distance. 
Each of these branches is composed of about eight or nine 
longish joints, and each joint terminates in a loose sheath : the 
branches have either eight or ten ribs, united in pairs, and rough 
with siliceous particles : the sheaths terminate in four or five 
teeth, each furnished at the extremity with a slender black bris- 
tle : a pair of ribs ascends into each of the teeth, and each rib 
is furnished, near its termination, with a series of rather long 
siliceous points, which give it a pectinated appearance. Such 
may be received as the description of a stem of normal size and 
characters, and the variations are very unimportant, chiefly con- 
sisting in size and number of branches, but rarely interfering 
with the figure of the frond, unless caused by circumstances, 
as excess of wet or drought, both apparently uncongenial to its

perfect development. One character, however, must not be 
passed over in silence, and that is, the liability of the branches 
to emit two, three, four, or even five, secondary branches, from 
the summit of the second joint : these branches are usually 
slender, and when present they give the plant a beautifully com- 
pound and feathery appearance. Sir J. E. Smith describes the 
1 branches of this species as four-angled, each angle having a 
longitudinal furrow, and remarks that this structure was first 
noticed by Mr, J. D. Sowerby ; but the description given by 
Ehrhart and Roth, in the works previously quoted, appear to me 
more precise and accurate, and I think must also be of earlier 
date. Ehrhart describes the branches as suhquadragenis, octo- 
sulcatisj sulcis alternis majorihus^'^ and Roth uses these words— 
“ rami * octo-sulcati, sulcis altemiis profundiorihus^ 

hinc tetragonir Both the descriptions are admirably applicable 
to our British plant, and satisfactorily fix its identity. Although 
there is some trouble in finding out and deciphering every pre- 
vious description of a plant, yet an author should do this as far 
as he can, and the knowledge thus gained will amply repay him. 
It is my own misfortune to be unable to devote the time requi- 
site for such a delightful labour ; and I can seldom give the 
continental authors of the Linnean school the attentive perusal 
they deserve, except when a doubtful species or confused syno- 
nymy actually enforces the task : but the search on these occa- 
sions, limited though it be, never fails to exhibit new causes to 
admire the skill, patience, accuracy, and profound knowledge 
exhibited in their careful writings. 

The stem presents a transverse section very different from that 
of any other species : it is represented on the next page, at 
figure c. At figure d I have attempted to show the structure of 
the sheaths of the branches in this species. These sheaths of 
the branches, secondary sheaths, or vaginulcBj as they are termed 
by Roth and others, are so different in the British Equisetums, 
that the inspection of a single one is quite sufficient to- determine 
the species ; and when specimens have been selected without 
much care for a herbarium, it not unfrequently happens that no 
other diagnostic can be consulted. I iherefore invite attention 
to the descriptions which I have drawn up with considerable

care, supposing the part to which I allude to have been rather 
neglected by many of our authors. The figure of the plant is 
so protean in the verticillate species, that it is satisfactory to 
possess so certain a diagnostic as these sheaths afford.

This is, beyond all comparison, the most abundant of our 
British Equisetums ; indeed it is a serious nuisance to the farmer 
and gardener, whose utmost efforts to eradicate it frequently 
prove ineffectual. It appears to have little choice of locality, 
being equally common in dry and moist situations. 


78 


EQUISETACE.E. 


The name of this species is now universally received, and I 
am not aware that any doubt exists as to its being the Equise- 
tum arvense of Linneus, although there is some confusion in the 
nomenclature of the specimens in the Linnean herbarium, as 
already shown The barren stem of this plant is without doubt 
the ^ Equisetum arvense longiorihus setis ’ of Ray’s ^ Synopsis,’t 
and it also seems to me that the ^ Equisetum pratense longiori- 
hus setis ’ of the same w’ork, although added by the careful Dil- 
lenius, is the same plant. Still this latter has sometimes been 
considered distinct as a species, and identical with the conti- 
nental E. pratense, which is so carefully described by Roth,:|; 
and previously, although not so fully, by Ehrhart.§ Roth, how- 
ever, admits that he had never seen the catkin, and the circum- 
stance of this being found on a branch-bearing stem forms the 
chief diagnostic of the species. Willdenow, who describes the 
species, II confesses he has not seen it at all, and almost every 
other author omits it altogether : thus it appears not improbable 
that some form of E. arvense was the plant originally intended. 
The ‘ Equisetum nudum minus hasiliense ’ of Ray can be none 
other than the fertile stem of E. arvense, as I think is sufficiently 
proved by the following passage. — “ This was first shew’d to 
Mr. Lawson at Great Salkeld, but grows in so great plenty there 
and every where on the banks of the River Eden, that he could 
not but wonder that this was the first time of its being observ’d 
in England. ’Tis an early and quickly fading Vernal Plant, 
which might probably be the Occasion of its not being hitherto 
taken notice of by those curious Gentlemen, who commonly be- 
gan their Circuits too late in the Year for such a Discovery .”H 
The ‘ Equisetum nudum minus variegatum hasiliense ’ of Bau- 
hin,'*'"'^ is quoted by Smith as synonymous with his E i variegatum, 
and by Linneus as synonymous with his E. hyemale, which

plants widely differ from the early disappearing plant described 
by Mr. Robinson in the passage above cited. 

The figures of this very common plant are so different that it 
seems impossible to reconcile the discrepancy otherwise than by 
a reference to the protean character of the original : that in 
Curtis's ‘ Flora Londinensis ’ * may perhaps be cited as the best. 

The corn-field Equisetum is supposed to be very injurious to 
cattle ; it is, however, most probable that they will not touch 
it, unless compelled by extreme hunger. 

This seems to be the only British species in which the fertile 
and barren stems are perfectly and constantly distinct, and of a 
different structure, the former having generally completely va- 
nished long before the latter have acquired their full development. 
In those species which are normally simple, ^. e. without whorls 
of branches, it appears the character of each full-sized and vigo- 
rous stem to produce a terminal cathin, consequently there is 
no observable difference in the structure of the fertile and bar- 
ren stems : in the following species, E. palustre and E. Jliivi- 
atile^ the same general character obtains, the grand distinction 
being in the almost constant presence of whorls of branches : 
in E. sylvaticum a marked difference is observable, for not only 
are a portion of the stems exclusively fertile and rapidly evanes- 
cent, but the mixed stems — those which bear both catkin and 
branches — are decidedly different to the exclusively barren ones, 
being more succulent, and having larger and looser sheaths : in 
E. umbrosum the discrepancy between fertile and barren stems 
is so great that the combination of the two, although common, 
has not been noticed by our British authors : in E. Telmateia 
these mixed stems are comparatively rare exceptions, and have 
almost been regarded as unnatural or monstrous ; so that we ar- 
rive, by an almost imperceptible transition, at E. arvense, in 
which the two kinds of stem are perfectly and constantly 
distinct. 

The figure at page 77 represents two stems of the corn-field 
Equisetum, of the natural size, a a being the fertile, h h the bar- 
ren stem : they are drawn from living specimens, and show the

immature barren stem synehronous with the perfectly ripe fertile 
stem, both of them ascending from the samerhizoma ; and I may 
here remark that the appearance of the barren stem at this early 
period is very similar in E, sylvaticum, timbrosum, Telmateia 
and arvense, so that the figure referred to gives a good idea of 
them all. The fertile stem, selected for the figure as one of ave- 
rage size and proportions, may be thus described : it is about 
nine inches in length, and is divided into eight joints, which 
decrease in length from the catkin downwards : the stem is ex- 
tremely succulent, of a pale brown colour, smooth and quite 
without furrow^s : the sheaths are loose, somewhat gibbous and 
distinctly ribbed ; they are of a pale yellowish brown colour at 
the base, and have about ten dark brown, long, pointed, teeth : 
these occasionally adhere at the points in twos and threes. 

The catkin is an inch and a quarter in length, rather slender, 
blunt and rounded at the apex, and stands on a distinct foot- 
stalk, usually about equal to half its own length ; it is of a pale 
delicate brown colour, occasionally tinged with rosy red ; the 
scales are very variable in number, being sometimes scarcely a 
hundred, at others reaching two hundred and fifty. The catkin is 
mature in May, and sheds abundance of seed of a beautiful 
green colour. 

The following is a description of a barren stem. Length 
twenty-eight inches ; very slender at the summit, and increasing 
to the size of a goose-quill at the base : the colour is glaucous 
green towards the summit, and pale green towards the base : the 
stem has from ten to sixteen distinct but not very deep furrows, 
and the same number of equally distinct ribs, which are fur- 
nished with very minute siliceous points : the number of joints 
is twenty-one ; the length of the internodes varies from half an 
inch at the summit to two inches at the base : the sheaths, in- 
cluding the teeth, are scarcely more than a quarter of an inch 
in length ; they are but little larger than the stem, not however 
clasping it so tightly as in E.Jluviatile : they are furrowed in the 
same manner as the internodes, but the ribs are double : the 
teeth are ten to sixteen in number, wedge-shaped, acute, and 
dark brown or black ; they are commonly, but not constantly, 
furnished with a narrow^, brown, marginal membrane : 1 have

never seen the teeth of this species with the distinct white semi- 
hyaline membrane, which appears constant in E. palustre, E. 
umbrosum, and some other species. There is a whorl of branches 
on each of the thirteen upper joints, the eight lower ones being 
branchless : the number of branches in a whorl varies from four 
to thirteen. The branches are eight to ten inches in length, ra- 
ther stout, spreading, slightly ascending, four-ribbed and com- 
posed of ten or twelve joints, of which the apical ones are 
shortest ; the basal joint is shorter than the three which follow 
it, but it is much longer than in E. palustre, and still more so 
than in E. umbrosum : the short sheath at the base of each 
branch usually terminates in obtuse brown segments : the other 
sheaths are loose, and terminate in four long acute teeth, which 
are generally concolorous throughout, and a single rib invariably 
ascends undivided to the extreme point of each. 

The more strongly marked variations of the barren stem are 
these. — 

A. — Stem erect ; branches simple, very rigid, erect, and 
densely crowded. 

B. — Stem erect ; branches simple, less rigid, spreading, 
slightly ascending. 

C. — Stem erect; branches simple, gracefully drooping. 

D. — Stem erect ; branches compound, in the same manner as 
in E. sylvaticum, and gracefully pendulous. 

E. — Stem almost prostrate, with semi-erect, very long, com- 
pound feeble branches. 

F. — Stem prostrate, with scattered, simple, irregular, semi- 
prostrate branches.

Adiantum Capillus-Veneris, Linneus. 

The true Maidenhair, the only species of the genus Adiantum 
that has been discovered in Britain, is one of our most local 
and most beautiful ferns : it always occurs in moist caves or 
the fissures of rocks, near the sea-coast, preferring a perpen- 
dicular surface, whence its delicate fronds grow in a nearly 
horizontal direction, inclining upwards at the extremity. 

Cornwall. — I am indebted to Miss J. M. Fox for a living- 
plant from Carclew, the seat of Sir C. Lemon, where it grows abun- 
dantly. Mr. Ralfs informs me he found it on cliffs within reach 
of the sea-spray, between St. Ives and Hayle ; and Mr. H. C. 
Watson gives me St. Ives as a habitat on the authority of the 
Rev. J. S. Tozer, and Garrick Gladden — a sea-cave in the same 
vicinity — on the authority of the Rev. Jas. Harris. 

Devonshire. —   I am indebted to Mr. Ward for specimens 
from the vicinity of Ilfracombe : he found it growing luxuriantly 
on the face and in the vertical crevice of a rock in White Peb- 
ble bay, in a dense mass, which commences at a height of about 
twenty-five feet, and descends to within about five feet of the 
level of the sea ; he also observed it at Rillidge point, and two 


84

other stations in the same neighbourhood. Mr. Edwin Lees has i 
likewise obligingly sent me specimens from the same localities : 
he found it in great abundance in September, 1843 : in every in- 
stance the fern was growing in gulleys of the cliff, where little 
rills of fresh water dribble down from above, depositing a tra- 
vertine sediment. Mr. J. Buckman, of Cheltenham, has kindly 
transmitted Ilfracombe specimens. I have also to acknowledge 
my obligation to the Botanical Society of London for specimens 
from Ilfracombe, collected by Mr. J. E. Gray, of the British 
Museum. Miss A. Griffiths informs me it has been found at 
Watermouth, also on the north coast ; and the Rev. W. S. 
Hore adds that it has lately been discovered near Brinham, on 
the south coast, by Mr. Bartlett. 

Wales. — MissM. Waring informs me she obtained specimens 
from rocks at Dunraven, in Glamorganshire ; and Mr. Dillwyn 
observes that it is common on the cliffs of lias at the eastern 
end of the county, but that he has not seen it on mountain 
limestone, or nearer to Swansea than Dunraven.* I have seen 
specimens from Barry Island, off the same coast, and this, as 
well as Port Kirig, have been given in all our Floras as localities. 

Isle of Man. — We find it mentioned in Lightfoot’s ^ Flora 
Scotica ’ as a native of the Isle of Man, but this locality appears 
to have been little regarded, indeed it had sunk into oblivion, 
when we were favored by a corroborative statement of the fact 
by the Rev. F. F. Clark.f From this gentleman we learn that 
the locality was rediscovered by Dr. Wood, of Cork, in or about 
1809, and by himself in 1835 and 1840 : in the latter year he 
thought it nearly exterminated, but Mr, T. G. Rylands again 
observed the plant in Glen Meay, in 1841 : he found young- 
plants in tolerable abundance, mixed with more mature ones, 
although it required close examination to discover the roots 
when the fronds were gone ; the finest root was high above a 
water-fall and perfectly inaccessible, so that he considers its 
extermination highly improbable. I am indebted to Mr. Wil- 
son for cultivated specimens, from a root brought by Mr. Ry- 
lands from this locality.

Scotland. — In Lightfoot’s ‘ Flora Scotica’ we find this re- 
cord : — “ Dr. Sibthorpe, the present most obliging Professor of 
Botany, at Oxford, favored me with the sight of a large and per- 
fect specimen of this fern, in the copious herbarium preserved at 
the Physic garden in that university, to which specimen a label 
was annexed, with this inscription, ‘ From the isle of Arran, 
near Galloway, from Mr. Stonestreet.’ The specimen is to be 
found among the ferns. — Lih. 3, p, 3, f. 3.”^ This statement 
is now universally believed to be an error, and to refer to the 
isles of Arran near Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. The 
banks of the Carron, a rivulet in Kincardineshire,” on the au- 
thority of Professor Beattie, as recorded by Sir W. J. Hooker, 
is another station that requires to be verified. 

Ireland. — I am indebted to Mr. Mackay, of the College Bo- 
tanic Garden, for a specimen from the south isles of Arran, 
where he found it in profusion ; and Mr. P. Ball, of Dublin, 
informs me it is so abundant in this locality, that the poor in- 
habitants use a decoction of its leaves instead of tea. Mr. W. 
Andrew’s found it sparingly on the Cahir Conree mountain, near 
Tralee ; and Mr. J. M’Calla, a most industrious and praise- 
worthy young botanist, residing at Roundstone, in Cunnemara, 
found a few’ plants at the foot of a rock facing south-west, on 
the banks of Lough Bulard, near Urrisbeg. 

The geographical range of the species is very wide, extending 
over the middle and south of Europe, Asia, the north of Africa, 
the Canary and Cape de Verd Islands; and forms so similar as 
scarcely to admit a doubt of their identity, occur in nearly every 
tropical or temperate country yet visited by botanists. 

The figures designed for this plant are for the most part very 
characteristic : that in Gerarde,f as quoted by Sir J. E. Smith, 
must, however, be excepted, and I cannot avoid entertaining a 
doubt as to the fern intended. 

Sir J. E. Smith has a remark upon the uses of a species of 
Adiantum^ which must be received with great caution : the pas- 
sage is as follows. — One species of this genus, A. pedatum, is 
principally used in the south of France to make a syrup, which, 


* Lig’liif. Flora Scotica ii. 07f). 


f Gcr. Em. 1 143. 


86 


ADIANTACE^. 


being perfumed with orange flowers, is called capillaire, and 
known by that name throughout Europe as a refreshing beve- 
rage when diluted with water.”* * * § Now I am not aware that 
A. pedatum has ever been found in Europe ; indeed it is entirely 
absent from Sadler’s list,t which was published in 1830, and is 
the most perfect I have yet seen. From this list it appears that 
Capillus- Veneris is the only species of Adiantum hitherto as- 
certained as an inhabitant of Europe. But even though we 
admit the existence of an error as regards the species, we still 
have the statement that this rare plant is employed in the manu- 
facture of capillaire : is not this also very questionable ? and 
does not the supposition originate in the French name of capil- 
laire being applied to the plant as w^ell as the syrup .?* We are 
told by Bulliard, in his work on the medicinal plants of France, 
that it is known in shops under the name of ^ Capillaire de 
Montpellier,’ and no mention is made of its use as an ingredient 
of the syrup called capillaire, though the author adds that it is 
frequently used in medicine. J 

The medicinal properties of the true Maidenhair have been 
much extolled. Bay, in his ‘ History of PI ants, ’§ gives a very 
detailed account of its wonderful virtues, and gives it too 
with all the gravity of implicit faith. His catalogue of diseases 
curable by preparations of this fern seems to include nearly all 
the ills that flesh is heir to : for his information on this head, 
our illustrious countryman acknowdedges his obligations to one 
Dr. Peter Formius, a Frenchman, w^ho really appears to have 
considered the plant a universal panacea. Still older writers 
also bear testimony to its powers; and Tragus, after enumerating 
sundry of its virtues, boasts of prudently omitting some of the 
uses to w'hich it has been applied, as unworthy of Christian 
men. II It must, however, be borne in mind that there is a great 
want of precision in the distinction of species in most of the 
earlier works, and that other species, more particularly Asplenium

Trichomanes and A. Ruta-mm'aria^ were confounded with the 
present under the common name of Adianlum, or, in England, 
of Maidenhair ; neither should it be forgotten that the boasted 
virtues of herbs and simples have, for the most part, proved fic- 
titious, and many of those, once most famous, have fallen into 
utter disuse. 

I'he roots are wiry, black, and fibrous ; the rhizoma, or un- 
der-ground stem, black and scaly, and creeping though very 
slowly : the young fronds make their appearance in IVJ ay, are 
fully developed in July, and remain green till the winter : the 
future divisions of the frond are not apparent on its first ex- 
panding ; three or five pinnae only appear, and these, in a few 
days, become divided into pinnules. 

Although the form of the frond has been repeatedly described 
by botanists in precise terms, it must be considered irregular : 
the rachis, or principal stem, is throughout naked, shining, and 
nearly black ; the branches, or pinnae, are alternate, and on these 
are the pinnules, also alternate, and each on a distinct foot-stalk : 
botanists describe these pinnules as wedge-shaped, or fan-shaped, 
but their form is not uniform, and often varies greatly in the 
same frond. The fronds are generally fertile, the exterior mar- 
gin of each pinnule being divided into a number of lobes, and 
the terminal portion of these is bleached, scale-like, reflexed, 
and bears the capsules of seed in somewhat circular clusters on 
its internal surface : this reflexed margin, and also the situation 
of the veins, is shown in the detached pinnule to the left of the 
cut at page 83 : the veins divide frequently, and without regu- 
larity, and run into the bleached reflexed portion of the lobe, 
ceasing before its extreme margin, and each bearing a cluster of 
capsules at its extremity ; this will be seen on reference to the 
lower figure in the same cut, which represents 
only one lobe or division of a pinnule : the 
reflexed portion, turned back, and showing the 
clusters of capsules, is unshaded. When bar- 
ren, which occurs but seldom, the margins, in- 
stead of being bleached and reflexed, are 
continued on the same plane as the disk of the pinnule, are 
sharply serrated (as represented in the annexed figure), and per- 



88

fectly green to the extremity : with this exception, the fertile and 
barren fronds are similar. When the frond has passed maturity, 
and approaches decay, the pinnules of this fern fall otf like the 
leaves of phaenogamous plants, the rachis remaining bare and 
leafless, and assuming the appearance of a bunch of strong 
bristles. 

Mr. Ball, of Dublin, pointed out to me a property which this 
fern possesses, when cultivated on Mr. Ward’s plan of checking 
communication with the outer air by means of a glass cover - 
the lobes of the pinnules become viviparous at the extremities, 
the seeds actually vegetating while still in situ, and the young 
plants taking root, like parasites, in the substance of the old 
one : from a specimen, in which this peculiarity was clearly exhi- 
bited, I sketched the vignette below. 

The figure at page 83 represents a small frond from Ilfracombe, 
of the natural size : the pinnules are frequently as large as the 
figure to the left of the same cut.

The Hard Fern is almost universally distributed throughout 
the kingdom, in woods, on commons, heaths, and all uncultivated 
ground : it is fond of moisture, ‘ and prefers clayey and gravelly 
soil : on chalk it is rarely met with. I do not recollect having 
seen a specimen from the chalk hills of Kent, Sussex or Surrey. 

This fern occurs in every European list, and has been found 
in Northern Africa : it has also been recorded as a native of 
North America, but I have met with no satisfactory evidence on 
this subject; and it is absent from collections which have been 
most obligingly sent me, from different localities, by Mr. Boott, 
Mr. Lea and Mr. Oakes.

ADIANTACE.E. 


The figures of this species are generally cha- 
racteristic, but the nomenclature is very confused, 
both as regards genus and species. In the first 
place, the genus Osmunda, under which it was 
placed by Linneus, is now, by universal consent, 
confined to ferns of a very different group ; and, 
in the second place, the specific name of spicant 
is not in accordance with the general usage of sci- 
ence, vfhich requires such names to be Latin words, 
or constructed in imitation of the Latin language. 
The last question may be dismissed in a few words. 
If we once admit the principle of changing spe- 
cific names, in accordance with our own views on 
the subject, we shall never have a settled nomen- 
clature ; and, therefore, our adherence to the 
Linnean names of species cannot be too rigid. 
The name of the genus is a much more difficult 
matter to settle. I believe that Withering was 
the first author who ventured to transfer this spe- 
cies from the Linnean genus Osmunda to the Lin- 
nean genus Blechnum, an alteration made, ac- 
cording to its author, “ in compliance with the 
opinion of Dr. Smith and Mr. Hobson. ” The 
name thus became Blechnum spicant ; and, ten 
years subsequently, the change was 
adopted by Swartz* as regards the ge- 
nus, and the specific name altered from 
spicant to horeale. Willdenow, in 
his ‘ Species Plantarum,’ instituted the

of good repute, referred to Willdenow’s new genus the species 
now under consideration, and restored the Linnean name to the 
species, calling the plant Lomaria spicant. Immediately after 
the publication of my first edition, the same name was pub- 
lished by Mr. J. Smith, in the ‘ Journal of Botany,’* and it has 
subsequently been adopted by the compilers of the Edinburgh 
Catalogue. t 

The roots of this fern are black, tough, and wiry ; the rhizoma 
tufted and hairy. The young fronds make their appearance in 
May ; they are of two kinds, fertile and barren : the fertile 
fronds arrive at perfection in September, shed their seed, and 
disappear before winter, but the barren fronds continue perfectly 
green and vigorous throughout the year. The fertile frond, re- 
presented of half the natural size by the figure on the preceding 
page, is erect, linear, simply pinnatifid and pointed at the apex ; 
the lower half of the stem is dark purple, smooth, shining, and 
naked, but furnished on each side with some minute rudimentary 
pinnae, scarcely observable without a close inspection, and 
having towards the base a few, scattered, long, narrow, and 
pointed scales ; the upper half of the stem has linear, narrow 
pinnae, rounded at the apex, convolute at the sides, and densely 
and completely covered with seed on the inferior surface. 

1 have to acknowledge the obligations I am under to Miss 
Beever, of Coniston, for fine Westmoreland specimens of this 
plant, sparingly fruited, and to Mr. Jenner, of Lewes, for similar 
Sussex specimens. From these I have been able to learn more 
of the venation of this species than appeared possible from an 
examination of the usual densely fruited form. In these speci- 
mens the pinnules remain flat, as in the barren fronds, a circum- 
stance which much facilitates the enquiry. The mid-vein of 
the pinna [aaa)X is somewhat sinuous, giving off oblique, alter- 
nate, lateral veins [h h b) these lateral veins are united to each 
other by what may be termed an irregular longitudinal vein

(c c c), running parallel with the mid-vein, and nearly equidistant 
between this and the margin of the pinnae (d d d) ; the union of 
the lateral veins causes the formation of a series of what may be 
termed closed cells {e e e) ; on each side of the mid-vein, from 
the two longitudinal veins, arise other lateral and slightly capi- 
tate veins ifff), which proceed obliquely towards the margin, 
and terminate just before reaching it ; to the two longitudinal 
veins the capsules are attached, in a continuous series, on that 
side of each vein which faces the mid-vein ; the points of their 
attachment are indicated in the lower figure, throughout the 
course of the two longitudinal veins : the capsules are covered 
by a continuous, linear, white, membranous involucre, which 
opens towards the mid-vein : these involucres are represented in 
the upper figure bythe white line {gg), and the series of capsules 
appearing beneath them are represented by the black line (A h). 
The fronds from which the descriptions and drawings were made, 
are so different from the usual state of fertile fronds, that the 
characters are chieffy valuable as affording a key to the normal 
venation, which has hitherto almost eluded our enquiries : yet 
furnished with this key we find that the same structure obtains, 
in a minor degree, in all the fertile fronds. 

The barren fronds are much shorter than the fertile, generally 
horizontal, strap-shaped and pinnatifid, and have a short portion 
of the stem, not more than a sixth, naked and slightly scaly.

Pteris aquilina, Linneus. 

The common Fern, or Brakes, as it has usually been termed, 
is the most abundant of our British species : there is scarcely a 
heath, common, wood, or forest, in any part of the United King- 
dom, in which it does not make its appearance : its presence, 
in great abundance, is said to indicate poverty in the soil, but 
from its luxuriance when growing in the vegetable mould of 
woods, and in highly manured gardens, I am inclined to suppose 
its usual absence from rich cultivated land is rather to be attri- 
buted to the effects of the plough and hoe than to any quality 
of the soil. It is quickly eradicated by either of these instru- 
ments, and seems peculiarly susceptible of injury. It appears 
one of those truly wild plants which fly from man, and take re- 
fuge in wastes and wildernesses. In size it is extremely vari- 
able ; sometimes it is scarcely a foot in height ; at others it 
reaches an altitude of ten and even twelve feet. Although it

occurs on every other description of soil, it avoids chalk, and 
scarcely a plant can be detected on the South downs of Sussex : 
in dry gravel it is usually present, but of small size, while in 
thick shady woods, having a moist and rich soil, it attains an enor- 
mous size, and may often be seen climbing up as it were among 
the lower branches and underwood, resting its delicate pinnules 
on the little twigs, and hanging gracefully over them ; under 
these circumstances it is a fern of exquisite beauty. 

The geographical range of the common Brakes is very exten- 
sive it is included in every European list ; it occurs also in 
Asia and Africa. The common Pteris of North America is, 
I believe, generally considered distinct : but there are so many 
points of resemblance that I am scarcely prepared to coincide 
in this decision. 

The figures of this fern invariably fail to give a correct idea 
of its appearance, from the diflSculty — almost amounting to im- 
possibility — of reducing it to the requisite size. 

The Brakes is the Filix femina of all our older authors, and 
the transfer of that name to another species was made by Lin- 
neus, who gave the plant now under consideration its present 
title : however unadvisable the change may have been at the 
time, it has been generally adopted by subsequent botanists. 
Presl, in his ^ Tentamen Pteridographiae,’^' has revised and di- 
vided the genus Pteris^ referring the present species to Bern- 
hardi’s genus Allosorus : but in this genus he has included 
species which scarcely possess a character in common ; and 
moreover, the Allosori aquilini, to which division of the genus 
the Brakes is referred, f constitute the third and not the typical 
division of the genus, which properly includes the Allosorus 
crispus, a very distinct and different plant. It therefore becomes 
necessary to institute a new genus for the reception of the AUo- 
sori aquilini of Presl, or else to restore to them their original 
generic appellation of Pteris. Not feeling competent to the 
former, I adopt the latter course, hoping that some more pro- 
found botanist will, ere long, undertake to classify the hete- 
rogeneous contents of this extensive genus.

This is not only the most abundant, but the most useful of 
our British Ferns. “ If cut while green, and left to rot upon 
the ground, it is a good improver of the land : * * it is an 

excellent manure for potatoes, and if buried beneath their roots 
it never fails to produce a good crop : ^ * it makes a brisk 

fire for the purposes of brewing and baking. * ^ In many 

of the western isles [of Scotland], the people gain a very consi- 
derable profit by the sale of the ashes to soap and glass-makers.”* 
Mr. Bladon, of Pont-y-pool, informs us that “ in many of the 
open mountainons parts of Wales, where it grows abundantly, 
the Brakes is cut down in the summer, and, after being well 
dried, is burned by the cottagers in large heaps, for the sake of 
the alkali contained in the ashes : w^hen sufficiently burned, 
enough water is sprinkled on the ashes to make them adhere 
together, when they are rolled into round balls, about two inches 
or two-and-a-half in diameter. These balls are thoroughly 
dried, and carried about the neighbourhood where they are made, 
for sale in the markets ; and they are also frequently kept by 
shopkeepers, to supply their customers. The price of these 
balls varies in different seasons, from 3c?. to 8c?. per dozen. 
They are very much prized by some housewives, for their utility 
in the wash-house, in economizing the use of soap. When 
about to be used they are put into the fire, and when heated to 
a red heat, are taken out and thrown into a tub of water : the 
water in the course of an hour or so, becomes a strong ley, and 
is then fit for use.”t 

As a litter for horses “fern” is in great request in many parts of 
Wales, Scotland and Ireland. While wandering among the 
mountains of Wales, I have continually met with sleighs, drawn 
by a ragged pony, and laden with Pteris by an industrious 
Welshwoman . when thus collected, it is not only used for litter, 
but is also chopped up when dry, and mixed with straw or hay, 
and given in the winter to the little horses and mules kept for 
working on the tram-roads. In Scotland, particularly in the 
western Flighlands, I often noticed it in use as a thatch for cot- 
tages ; and Lightfoot remarks, — “ In Glen Elg, in Invernesshire,

and other places, we observed that the people thatched their 
houses with the stalks of this fern, and fastened them down with 
ropes made either of birch-bark or heath ; sometimes they used 
the whole plant for the same purpose, but that does not make so 
durable a covering.” The same author goes on to say that 
swine are fond of the roots if boiled in their wash ; and Mr. 
Edwin Lees has recorded in ‘ The Phytologist ’ f that in the 
forest of Dean he saw some girls carrying a quantity of recently 
cut Pteris aquilina or Earn, which they retailed at twopence 
per bushel. On enquiring the use for which it was intended, he 
W’as informed that it was extensively employed in the forest for 
feeding pigs, which are very fond of it : for this purpose, however, 
it must be cut while the fronds are still uncurled, and must be 
boiled. The slushy or mucilaginous mass thus produced is con- 
signed to the wash-tub or other receptacle, and in this state it 
will keep as pig-food for a considerable length of time. Mr. 
Lees w^as informed that it was found very serviceable, especially 
to cottagers, as coming in at an early period of the summer, 
when the produce of the garden is generally scanty. Mr. Lees 
suggests that it might not be an unpalateable accompaniment 
to a rasher of bacon, but its use as an article of human sus- 
tenance is not quite so questionable as it would be if de- 
pendant on this ingenious speculation : we learn from Lightfoot 
that it has not unfrequently occurred that the poorer inhabitants 
of some parts of Normandy have been reduced to the miserable 
necessity of mixing the large and succulent rhizomas of this 
fern with their bread ; and in Siberia, and some other northern 
countries, the inhabitants brew them in their ale, using one-third 
of these rhizomas to two -thirds of malt. The ancients also are 
said to have used both the rhizomas and fronds of this fern in 
decoctions and diet drinks, in chronic disorders of all kinds, 
arising from obstructions of the viscera and spleen. Some of

the more modern writers have given it a high character for the 
same purposes, but it is now falling into disuse among medical 
practitioners : the country people, however, in Haller’s time, still 
continued to employ it for its ancient uses, and gave it as a 
powder to destroy worms; they also regarded a bed of the green 
fronds as a sovereign cure for the rickets in children : probably 
these uses are still in vogue. Its astringency is so great that 
it is used in many places abroad in dressing and preparing kid 
and chamois leather.^ 

The only British species of Cicada, the C. liccmatodes of Lin- 
neus, is said to feed, in the larva state, on the rhizoma of this 
fern : in the companion work to the ‘ History of British Ferns,’ 
I have represented this insect, together with its empty pupa- 
case, the latter still adhering to the stem of Pteris aquilina, in 
the position in which it has been found in the New Forest, in 
Hampshire, the only British locality yet discovered for the in- 
sect.f The beautiful caterpillar of a British moth [Mameslra 
Pisi) is found in great abundance on the brakes in autumn. 

The roots are brown, fibrous, and tomentous. The rhizoma 
is brown, velvety, and most extensively and rapidly creeping ; it 
generally runs in a nearly horizontal direction, but sometimes 
dips deeply and almost perpendicularly. When the London and 
Croydon railway was in progress, I found, in the New Cross 
cutting, great abundance of these underground stems in a de- 
cayed state, some of them extending to a perpendicular dejDth 
of fifteen feet. Whenever this fern has stood unmolested for a 
long series of years, the soil becomes filled with matted masses 
of these stems. The young fronds make their first appearance 
in May ; they are extremely tender, and the first shoots are 
almost invariably destroyed by the late frosts of spring ; I have 
seen them cut down to the surface of the ground as late as the 
20th of May. The young fronds come up bent or doubled, the 
leafy portion being pressed against the stem : the cut at page 
93 shows a number of young fronds in various stages of deve- 

Nearly the whole of these observations are in Haller’s Historia, aed

lopment, and also the mode in which they spring from the rhi- 
zoma. The portion of the stem below the ground is of a dark 
browm colour, velvety, and considerably stouter than the portion 
above ground ; it closely resembles the rhizoma in its general 
appearance. When this incrassated portion of the stem is cut 
through, either in a direct or oblique di- 
rection, the section bears a regular figure, 
as represented in the annexed cut, the 
left-hand section being direct, the right hand oblique. This fi- 
gure is by many said to represent an oak tree, and is called King 
Charles in the Oak; by others it is supposed to resemble a 
spread eagle, hence the specific name of Aquilina, given by 
Linneus. We learn from Mr. Francis’s ‘Analysis of British 
Ferns,’ that this appearance “ was a matter of notoriety at a ve- 
ry early period. Thus we find,” says that author, “ in a most 
rare little book, entitled ‘ A Dyalogue or Communycation of two 
persons devysed or set forth, in the Latin Tonge, by the noble 
and famous clarke Desiderius Erasmus, intituled. The Pilgrim- 
age of pure Devotion newly translatyd into Englyshe’ (no date, 
supposed to be 1551), is the following curious passage : “ Per- 
aventure they ymagyne the symylytude of a tode to be there ; 
evyn as we suppose when w^e cutte the fearne stalke there to be 
an egle.’ ” * The frond is killed by the first frosts of autumn, 
however slight they may be ; it instantly turns to a deep brown 
colour, but remains perfectly undecayed, and frequently in an 
erect position, during the whole winter. 

The form of the firond is nearly triangular, the base being 
somewhat but not materially the shortest of the three sides. 
The naked portion of the stem is rather more than half the length 
of the frond, it is green and rather pilose ; the pinnae are pin- 
nate, the pinnules pinnatifid ; the lobes are generally rounded 
and entire, but sometimes again divided ; the first superior pin- 
nule on each pinna is usually very small, and, as it were, rudi- 
mentary only. The fronds are almost invariably fertile, but all 
parts of the same frond are not equally so. In seedling plants, 
or those which occasionally grow in caves, fissures, or on stone

walls, the fronds are smaller, tender, delicate and barren ; the 
margins of the lobes of the pinnules are then flattened, and 
broadly notched. 

Mr. Lees sent me an example of this form, gathered on a wall 
near Worcester cathedral; Mr. Westcombe another, found on a 
wall in the centre of the city of Worcester: it occurs commonly 
on the garden-walls at Deptford; in one instance it has esta- 
blished itself on the brick wall of a house in Union Street, and 
during the present year, 1843, it has made its appearance upon 
the wall which separates the Friends’ burial-ground from Mr. 
Hart’s garden in High Street : Mr. Woodward’s collection con- 
tains a fine example, gathered by Mr. Pamplin, at East Grin- 
stead, in Sussex ; and Mr. Ewing has observed a solitary plant 
for many years growing on the wall of the bridge of the castle-moat, 
Norwich, the fronds varying from three to nine inches in length. 
In these and other instances, too numerous to mention, the same 
characters are always preserved. 

When fertile, the lobes are incurved or convolute at their 
edges, and their elasticity is so invincible, that it is very diffi- 
cult to maintain the lobe in a flat position, 
adapted for an examination of its fructifica- 
tion. The lateral veins, which are placed ei- 
ther opposite or alternately, are twice dichoto- 
mously divided before reaching the margin, 
where they are united together by means of a 
marginal vein. The accompanying diagram 
shows the formula of venation in a lobe which 
has been flattened for the purpose of exhibit- 
ing it more clearly. Attached to the marginal 
vein, a «, and extending throughout its length, 
is a bleached semihyaline membrane, fringed 
with a series of jointed capillary segments. Beneath this mem- 
brane are the capsules, also attached to the marginal vein, and 
arranged along it in a continuous linear series, but more abun- 
dantly at its points of union with the transverse veins. Again, 
beneath this linear series of capsules, is a second bleached and 
fringed membrane very similar to the first. It becomes an inte- 
resting question whether both these membranes can be consi=

dered analogous to the usual involucre, or one of them only; 
and if one only, then which are we to select ? Roth does not 

appear to have observed the inferior membrane, but describes 
the superior one as an involucre originating in an elongated epi- 
dermis.^' Sir J. E. Smith, although aware of this inner mem- 
brane, unhesitatingly speaks of the outer one as the cover. 
Mr. Wilson, who has most obligingly favoured me with many va- 
luable observations on this remarkable structure, seems to regard 
the inferior membrane as the involucre; the occasional presence 
of the superior membrane in the total absence of capsules, prov- 
ing, in his opinion, that it is not necessarily connected with fruc- 
tification. Still, although I may state that I do not detect its 
presence in seedling or barren plants, and am therefore led in 
a measure to associate its appearance at least with the power of 
producing fruit, yet I am quite inclined to consider it distinct 
from a true involucre, and more analogous to the indexed por- 
tion of the pinnule in Adiantum and Allosorus, which, although 
considered an involucre by Sir J. E. Smith, and all our more 
eminent authorities, and although there can be no question that 
its presence is connected with fructification, since in both these 
instances it is absent when the frond or pinnule is entirely bar- 
ren, yet 1 have always regarded as perfectly distinct : instances 
however occur, in all the genera here cited, in which this in- 
flexed or folded margin of the pinnule is totally unaccompanied 
by the presence of capsules, as pointed out to me in Pteris by 
Mr, Wilson. Mr. Jenner, who has most obligingly taken the 
greatest pains to assist me in the enquiry, as regards Pteris, also 
appears to consider the exterior membrane as nothing more than 
a prolongation of the outer epidermis. The question as regards 
the interior membrane seems much more restricted : we are com- 
pelled to regard this as an involucre, from the absolute absence 
of any other analogous part to which, with any show of plausi- 
bility, it can possibly be referred. I have stated that the margins 
of each lobe are convolute, so that the marginal vein and its

accompanying membranes, together with the series of capsules 
between, are bent over towards the midvein, presenting an ap- 
pearance which I have attempted to repre- 
sent in the accompanying figure of the 
under surface of the apex of a lobe : h h 
is the marginal vein in its natural position ; 
c c, the indexed or convolute portion of 
the leaf ; d d the superior membrane par- 
tially covering the capsules, which are 
shown at e e projecting from beneath it ; f 
is the midvein of the lobe. The inferior 
membrane, although very similar to the su- 
perior, has some points of difference ; each 
consists of a disk divided into cells, and a 
marginal fringe of jointed hairs or capilla- 
ry segments, but the disk is somewhat differently marked. Mr. 
Jenner has taken great pains to obtain a view of both the mem- 
branes at once, and has favoured me with 
the annexed sketch, the accuracy of which 
1 have tested by examination. The 
marginal vein of the lobe is supposed to 
be presented to view^ edgeways at g, the 
capsules having been removed, in order to 
leave the view of the membranes unob- 
structed ; h represents the superior, and i 1 ^ \ 

the inferior membrane. 

It is highly probable that the great discrepancy betw^een the 
species of Pteris, as regards their mode of fructification, wdll 
eventually induce a more precise and natural grouping than any 
we are at present acquainted with. It seems to me that in this, 
as in other instances among the ferns, a single character has been 
somewhat arbitrarily selected, and considered of paramount im- 
portance, while the combination of other characters — for instance, 
those of habit, figure or texture — have been too much disregarded. 
The present work purposes to be a history of species, and it 
would be altogether foreign to such a purpose to make it an es- 
say on classification, yet I cannot with fairness to myself entirely 
w ithhold my opinion that the very basis of the classification of

ferns, as generally adopted, is artificial. It is, however, with 
great pleasure that I observe some of our authors endeavouring 
to emancipate it from the thraldom thus imposed, and venturing 
an appeal to Nature. Presl, on the continent, has taken the lead 
in this honourable task, and I could wish that his accuracy 
equalled his sagacity ; but there are so many and such striking 
instances of carelessness in his ^ Tentamen Pteridographise,’ 
that the cause of truth and nature will, 1 fear, scarcely reap that 
benefit from his labours which ought to result from the exposi- 
tion of such luminous ideas. In our own country, Mr. John 
Smith, of Kew, has laboured in the same field with no less zeal 
and much more care. From the labours of both these authors 
much greater advantages are to be anticipated than any we have 
yet received. From conversation with Mr. Smith I learn far more 
than from his published works : all his views are characterized 
by a desire to make artificial give way to natural characters, and 
to reject all association of species when not plainly existent in 
Nature ; in fact, to follow Nature rather than to lead her.

The Rock Brakes, Rock Parsley, or Parsley-leaved Fern, is 
a small plant, generally varying between four and eight inches 
in length : where abundant, its bright green fronds form a cheer- 
ful and pleasing contrast to the dark masses of weather-beaten 
and lichen-stained rock, by which it is almost invariably sur- 
rounded. Although it occasionally condescends to seek a shelter 
in the crevices of old walls, its favorite dwelling-place is among 
the shapeless masses of stone which are often strewn in such 
wild profusion down the sides of oiir mountains. It is a local 
plant, and the north of England seems to be its favorite station. 
I have given below a summary of the English and Welch coun- 
ties where it occurs, and by this it will be seen that it is entirely 
absent from the south-eastern districts.

Penhill ; Settle, and many other localities, are recorded. 

In Scotland it appears to be widely, but sparingly, distributed ; 
a few localities are subjoined. 

Aberdeenshire. — Mountains near Castleton. — Mr. Watson. 

Argyleshire. — I found it in several localities, sparingly. 

Dumbartonshire. — I first found this species near the inn at 
Tarbet, on Loch Lomond, at a very low elevation. 

Dumfriesshire. — Mr. Babington found it at Jardine hall, the 
seat of Sir William Jardine : Mr. Cruickshank informs me that 
it occurs on loose stone walls near George Town, Queensbury 
hill and Rae hills, and in several other parts of the county, but 
never in any abundance. 

Forfarshire.— Mr. Watson found it on the Clova mountains; 
Mr. Croall and Mr. Stables on the same range. 

Invernesshire. — Mr. Watson observed it on Ben Aulder, 
near Dalwhinnie, and on Ben Nevis. 

Kirkcudbrightshire.— Mr. Cruickshank finds it on the summit 
of Criffel, 1895 feet above the level of the sea. 

Perthshire. — Mr. Gourlie finds.it occasionally on the moun- 
tains of Perthshire, as Maelronchler, Ben Lawers, &c. I ob- 
served it on stone walls near Killin, and in many other places.

POLYPODIACE^. 


Rosshire. — Mr. Watson gives this county on the authority of 
Mr. Wilson. 

Sutherland.' — Mr. Francis gives Sutherland on the authority 
of Dr. Murray. 

In Ireland it is a plant of great rarity, occurring very sparingly, 
and only in three counties which approach those English coun- 
ties, in which it is most abundant. 

Antrim. — Mr. Moore informs me he found a few specimens 
in the liberties of Carrickfergus. 

Down. — Mr. Thompson informs me it was found in the crevi- 
ces of the rocks about the summit of Sleive Bignian, on the 20th 
of August, 1808, by the late Mr. Templeton, Mr. Mackay, and 
Dr. W. Stokes : it is said, in the ‘ Flora Hibernica,’ to be abun- 
dant on the Mourne mountains, but this seems scarcely correct : 
many botanists have been unsuccessful in their search for it, and 
Mr.* Thompson says that after spending ten hours on these 
mountains he could not find a specimen of Allosorus. 

Louth. — Mr. Thompson informs me that in 1836 he obtained 
a single specimen on Carlingford mountain, in this county. 

It has not been observed in Orkney by Mr. Clouston, or in 
Shetland by Mr. Edmonston. 

The geographical range of Allosorus crispus is confined to 
Europe, as far as my information has hitherto extended : it ap- 
pears to occur here and there throughout the continent : it is 
recorded as a native of Sweden, Germany, Hungary, France, 
Italy and Spain. I have seen no corresponding form from North 
America. 

Many characteristic figures of the Rock Parsley may be re- 
ferred to ; those in Bolton’s ^ Filices,’ ^ ‘ Flora Danica,’ f and 
^ English Botany,’ % Ri’u very like the plant. Our old friend, 
Gerarde, the herbalist, appears to have omitted it altogether, but 
Ray has described it as ^Adiantum album crispum alpinum^% 

This species appears to have perplexed botanists greatly, as 
to the genus in which it ought to be placed : Linneus made it 
an Osmunda, but in a MS. note to his own ‘Species Plantarum’ 
he transfers it to Pteris ; our British authors, Hudson, Lightfoot, 
Bolton, and Berkenhout, follow him in his first nomenclature ;

Withering and Smith in his second. Roth makes it an Onoclea, 
associating it with O. Strut1iiopte7'is, the Struthiopteris germa- 
7 iica of later writers. By three eminent botanists it has been 
made the type of a new genus, viz., by Bernhardi, under the 
name of Allosorm ; by Desveux, under the name Phoroholus ; 
and by Robert Brown, under the name Cryptogramma. Of 
these three names, Allosorus has been adopted on the ground of 
priority, by Sprengel, George Don (in Loudon’s ‘ Hortus Bri- 
tannicus’), Sadler, Presl, the compilers of the ‘ Edinburgh Cata- 
logue,’ and Babington ; and Cryptogramma by Hooker and 
Mackay. The principal characters by which to distinguish this 
plant from our other British Polypodies, are that its fronds are both 
barren and fertile, and that the margins of the pinnules in the 
fertile frond are indexed or convolute, covering the clusters of 
capsules. Mr. Gibson objects to the first of these characters ; 
and I have to acknowledge my obligation to him, as well as to 
Miss Beever and Mr. Cruickshank, for fronds partially fruitful 
and partially barren. Mr. Gibson objects to the view I take of 
this character, on the ground of what he considers its incon- 
stancy; but with great deference to the opinion of so excellent 
a botanist, 1 must acknowledge that I still continue to regard 
the fertile and barren fronds of the Rock Brakes as perfectly dis- 
tinct : in the British ferns, Lomai’ia spicant, Allosorus crispus, 
and Lastrcea Thelypteris, we observe a marked and constant 
difference between the two kinds of fronds, whereas in all our 
other species the want of fruit is the result of immaturity, un- 
congenial situation, or some other casualty. I will not contend 
that such a character is sufficient for the establishment of a ge- 
nus, but that it is one of great interest, and not to be neglected 
on the ground that an intermediate and somewhat monstrous 
production may be occasionally found. Still, as regards the ge- 
nus, the present species is in every respect a Polypodium, even 
as restricted by Presl’s description in his recent work,^' and his 
figure of the venation of this speciesf appears to me incorrect. 

The roots are fibrous, numerous, tough, and adhere tenaciously 
to the earth or stones : the rhizoma is procumbent, extending

itself horizontally, and producing a 
constant succession of fronds from 
its crown. This procumbent or hori- 
zontal position appears to me rather 
the result of age, or want of power 
to maintain an erect position, than of 
a tendency to a creeping habit, as 
supposed by Sir J. E. Smith.^ The 
fronds rise in May and June, and 
disappear at the commencement of 
winter : as before stated, they are of 
two kinds, fertile and barren, both of 
which are nearly triangular in form, 
and,like the frond of AdiantumCapil- 
lus- Veneris^ composed of numerous, 
leaf-like, ultimate divisions : the pin- 
nae, pinnules, and ultimate divisions, 
are arranged alternately : the stem is 
slender, smooth, pale green, and ge- 
nerally much longer than the frond, 
which is of a bright and delicate 
green colour. The ultimate divisions 
of the fertile fronds are of a some- 
what oval form, and stand on distinct 
petioles, as shown at figure a ; their 
margins are indexed or convolute, 
attenuated and bleached : figure b is 
a magnified representation of one of 
these little leaves, with its margins 
rolled over as in a state of nature. 
The mid-vein is flexuous, and bears 
eight or ten lateral veins, placed al- 
ternately : these are divided shortly 
after leaving the mid-vein, and each 
branch bears a nearly circular cluster 
of capsules, at or very near its ex- 
tremity which does not quite reach

the margin. The little leaves are frequently auricled near the 
footstalk on one side only ; this is shown in figures d and e : 
c represents the margins as flattened, and the clusters of cap- 
sules consequently uncovered ; at d the margin is flattened on 
one side only ; at e both margins are flattened, the capsules re- 
moved, and only the points of their attachments indicated, to- 
gether with the veins on which they are placed. The character 
of the barren frond is very various : its appearance is generally 
crowded and crisped like the leaves of parsley, but its ultimate 
divisions are much the same with those of the fertile frond. 
Three forms of the barren frond are represented at f, g and h ; 
all these are of common occurrence : in f the ultimate divi- 
sions are formed like little oak leaves ; the venation of one of 
these magnified is shown at figure ^ ; g represents a frond in 
which the ultimate divisions are nearly linear : I have frequently 
received this as Cystopteris alpina ; indeed from what I have 
seen in various herbaria, I am inclined to think it is the usual 
representative of that plant : A is a form of less common occur- 
rence, yet rarely absent where the plant is growing in consi- 
derable quantities. 

I was not aware, when publishing my first edition, that I had 
been so completely forestalled by Roth in my view of the fruc- 
tification of this plant.'^' He has described it under the name of 
Onoclea crispa^ and has defined, with his usual clearness and 
accuracy, the peculiarities of its fructification; still I cannot 
but regard his making it an Onoclea as somewhat of an error in 
judgment, though perhaps pardonable, when we reflect that it 
originated more in his invincible dislike to encumber the science 
with new names, than from a conviction that our plant is at all 
nearly related to the giant Struthiopteris. It appears, however, 
from an observation following his description, that he felt con- 
siderable inclination to refer the plant to the genus Polypodium, 

* Propter fructificatioimm glomerulos ante maturitatem ad versum foliolo- 
rum marginem solitarios, Polypodii speciera refert primo intuitu haec planta, quae 
maturis et effusis capsulis demum confluentibus Pteridem mentitur. At si fo- 
liolorum crenulas revolutas et glomerulum suum capsularum tegentes respicias 
ad Onocleam potius pertinere videtur. — Roth, Flor. Germ. iii. 40.

and he speaks of its similarity to Pteris as deceptive. I need 
make no apology for having introduced his interesting observa- i 
tion as a foot-note (see p. 109), and I may observe that the genus 
Onoclea is now generally restricted to the beautiful Onoclea sen- 
sibilis of North America. 

The vignette below refers to the next rather than the present 
species ; it represents the Common Polypody in a favorite sta- 
tion, one of those decaying stumps over which its creeping rhi- 
zoma delights to wander. In the south-west of England it ^ 
ascends the loftiest trees, and in Epping forest I have often seen 
it ornamenting, with its bright green fronds, the heads of the 
pollard horn-beams, when the wintry blast has stripped them of 
their summer verdure.

Polypodium vulgare, Linneus. 


The common Polypody is one of our best known and most 
abundant ferns; it is to be found in almost every hedge. It 
abounds on stone walls and decaying trees, and on the surface 
of weather-beaten rocks, quickly succeeding the mosses and 
lichens which first establish a footing in these situations. 

Its geographical range is very extensive : it is present in every 
European list, and occurs in various parts of Asia and Africa. 
The North- American plant known by the same name, presents 
a slight difference in the venation, the number of branches in 
the lateral veins being two or three, instead of four ; some au- 
thors consider this plant distinct, others look upon it as identical 
with the European species : I incline to agree with the latter. 

The figures of this fern are generally very excellent: good 
ones are so numerous that I scarcely know which to select for 
notice. None surpass in fidelity those by Gerarde of the usual 


112

form.^ The Linnean name of Polypodium vulgare appears to 
have been universally adopted. 

The medicinal properties of the common Polypody were 
once highly extolled, but the plant is now fast falling into dis- 
repute among medical men : a mucilaginous decoction of its 
fronds was formerly very commonly administered to children, as 
a cure for worms, colds, and the hooping-cough; and I have 
seen elderly women collecting it in Herefordshire, as a specific 
against the latter disease : it is gathered in October and No- 
vember, when full of seed, the barren fronds being rejected ; it 
is hung up in the cottage to dry, and when required for use is 
slowly boiled with coarse raw sugar. It is called by these ga- 
therers Golden locks, and Golden Maiden-hair. 

The roots are brown, and often clothed with a thick pilosity. 
The rhizoma is brown, and entirely covered with a densely pi- 
lose cuticle, which dries and peels off after one year’s growth, 
leaving the rhizoma smooth ; it is decidedly creeping, making 
annual advances of considerable extent. The young fronds are 
thrown out in May and June; they arrive at maturity early in 
September, and retain their full vigour until the fronds of the 
succeeding year make their appearance. The young fronds are 
generally erect at first, but droop by degrees, and are always 
pendent when mature : the stem is green, and nearly equals the 
frond in length ; the form of the frond is strap-shaped and pin- 
natifid, and acute at the apex, (fig. d) ; the pinnae are nearly 
linear, and rounded at the apex, their margins are more or less 
serrated. The usual size is shown by the detached pinnae, re- 
presented in the preceding page, (figs, h and c). The fronds 
are fertile only, and the clusters of capsules are generally con- 
fined to the upper part of each : when without fruit, the imper- 
fection arises from uncongenial situation, and the plant is not to 
be considered in a perfectly natural and healthy state. 

The situation of the veins is shown in the detached pinna (fig. 
c) : the lateral veins are alternate, and each is divided into four 
branches, three of which extend nearly to the margin, and are 
incrassated at their termination ; the fourth is directed forwards, 


* Ger. Em. 1132, both figures.

and its termination, which is nearly equidistant from the mid~ 



vein and margin, bears a circular cluster of capsules, which is 
entirely without an involucre. A single lateral vein, its four 


114 


POLYPODIACE.E. 


branches, the attachment of the capsules, and the extent of the 
circular cluster, indicated by a dotted line, are shown at fig. d. 

In form of frond the Common Polypody is tolerably uniform; 
it is however subject to a few variations, some of which are re- 
markable ; the detached pinna bearing the clusters of capsules 
(fig. c) shows a strongly serrated variety, and the entire frond 
(fig. e) has the termination of the pinnae bifid. Another variety, 
which is perfectly barren, is so strongly serrated, that Linneus 
considered it a distinct species, and described it under the name 
of Polypodium Camhricum : the identical frond, named and de- 
scribed by that great naturalist, is now in the possession of the 
Linnean Society of London. Figure on the preceding page, 
is a careful representation of this frond. I have never been suc- 
cessful in my search for this form of the Common Polypody in 
Wales, but have seen in many botanic gardens fine Irish speci- 
mens, and am indebted to Mr. Moore of the Dublin Glasnevin 
garden, for a root found in the county Wicklow many years since : 
it is still in full vigour, and its remarkable character is perfectly 
unchanged by cultivation ; Mr. Thompson, of Belfast, informs 
me that it was found by the late Mr. Templeton, in a glen at 
Bed hall, near Carrickfergus, county Antrim. Figure g represents 
a still more remarkable variety, found by Mr. Mackay, in the 
Dargle, in the county Wicklow; the frond represented was sent 
by Mr. Mackay to the late Sir J. E. Smith, and is also in the 
possession of the Linnean Society : it differs from the preceding 
variety in being fertile. 

In Ireland this species is much more subject to vary than in 
England. I have gathered a number of fronds in various parts of 
the county Kerry, which bear some slight resemblance to Mr. 
Mackay’s beautiful variety ; in those districts the frond is also 
much larger and wider, and grows with greater luxuriance. I 
must not, however, omit to record my thanks to Dr. Greville for 
a gigantic English specimen, gathered at Sidmouth; to Mr. Jen- 
ner for another gathered in Kent; and to Mr. W. Southall, jun., 
for others, deeply serrated, gathered in a lane at Moseley, near 
Birmingham.

BEECH FERN, [young fi'onds of the natural size). 

Polypodium Phegopteris^ Linneus. 

The Beech Fern is one of our most beautiful species, and 
seems particularly fond of wild and mountainous countries, wet 
woods and the vicinity of waterfalls. I have found its rhizoma 
in such situations, either abundantly intermingled with mosses, 
on the face of some constantly moistened rock, or creeping 


116 


POLYPODIACEJ?.. 


among the decaying leaves and twigs which form the covering 
of the ground in woods and forests. 

In England and Wales it occurs in the most northern, most 
western, and most southern counties, but appears entirely ab- 
sent from a large eastern and midland tract, of which Bedford- 
shire may be considered the centre. Its range of elevation is 
very considerable, occupying at least 2500 feet. I subjoin the 
more interesting or abundant localities. 

Brecknockshire. — Mr. Ralfs considers the Beech Fern as 
common in this county : Mr. Lees informs me he found it in the 
wood on the left bank of the stream near the waterfall at Pont 
Henry d, near Capel Colboen. Mr. Dillwyn observed it at 
Uscoed Hendry and LTscoed Eynon Gam, as recorded in the 
‘ Phytologist,’ p, 182, and Mr. Westcorabehas found it in many 
localities about the Black mountains, the Brecon beacon and 
Chapel-y-Fyn. 

Caermarthenshire. — Mr. Lees found it just below the water- 
fall at Glynhir near Llandebie. 

Caernarvonshire. — I have seen it at Aberglaslyn, Beddge- 
lert, Rhaidr-y-Wenol, Falls of Lugwy, Capel Curig, Llanberis, 
Twll du, Falls of Ogwen, Carnedd David, Bangor, and in many 
other localities : it is abundant and almost continuous upon a 
wall to the right of the road between Llyn Gwynant and the Pass 
of Llanberis : my correspondents have supplied me with a great 
number of stations in addition to these ; and it may be consi- 
dered a common fern throughout the county. 

Cheshire. — Mr. Pinder informs me he found it at Mow^-cop, 
in this county ; and Mr. Sidebotham at Werneth. Early-banks 
wood near Staley bridge, is recorded as a habitat in the ‘Bota- 
nist’s Guide,’ on the authority of Mr. Bradbury. 

Cardiganshire. — I found it abundantly in the Devil’s bridge 
district, and near Hafod. 

Cornwall. — Mr. Borrer informs me he found it not far from 
Tintagel, on the road towards Camelford. 

Cumberland.-— A common fern in this county. Mr. Pinder 
has found it abundantly in Wasdale, Borrowdale, Ennerdale, 
and on Honister Red pike, Scaw fell. Screes, &c., often at the 
very summits of the mountains : it has been observed by several

117 


botanists about Keswick, at the waterfall of Lodore, and other 
localities : Mr. Heysham finds it on moist shady rocks in New- 
biggin w^ood, Baron wood, Gelt quarries, and on the banks of 
small streams on Tindall fell. 

Derbyshire. — Dr. Wood informs me it grows in profusion on 
the limestone rocks at Buxton. 

Devonshire. — Mr. Babington has observed it at Sheep’s tor; 
Mr. Ralfs on Dartmoor, not unfrequently ; Miss Hill at Ilfra- 
combe; the Rev. W. S. Hore on the summit of Cock’s tor; Mr. 
Kingston at Becky falls ; and Jones, in the ‘ Flora Devoniensis,’ 
records Lidforce w^aterfall as a locality. 

Durham. — Mr. Watson informs me that Mr. R. B. Bowman 
found it at Cawsey dene ; and Mr. Winch gives Cawsey wood, 
Waskerley dene, Cowclose, and Arngills, as localities. 

Glamorganshire. — Mr. Lees found it at the waterfalls 
of Scwd-y-Gladis and Cilhepste ; Mr. Dillwyn at Pont Nedd 
Yechn. 

Herefordshire. — I have seen it in Shobden-hill woods, and 
at Aymestree quarry, at the latter place very luxuriantly and 
abundantly. 

Lancashire. — Mr. S. Gibson informs me that it grows at 
Dulesgate, near Todmorden ; Mr. Wilson at Lancaster, beyond 
the asylum, and at Dean-church dough near Bolton; Mr. Piii- 
der at Fox dough near Colne, Padiham brook near Whalley, 
and on the Old-man mountain; Mr. Sidebotham at Mere-dough 
and Cotteril- dough ; Miss Beever near Coniston ; and Dr. 
Wood at Philip’s wood near Prestwick, and Boghart-hole dough. 

Merionethshire. — I observed this fern in several places near 
Barmouth, and at the waterfalls of Rhaidr-y-Mawddach, Pistil-y- 
Cayne, Dol-y-mellyn-lyn, &c. 

Montgomeryshire. — I found it on the natural walls of seve- 
ral of the little fissures through which mountain streamlets flow, 
on the ascent of Plinlymmon. 

Northumberland. — Mr. Winch has recorded as habitats the 
Cheviot hills, rocks west of Shewing-shields, moors near Wal- 
lington, &c. 

Radnorshire. — Mr. Westcombe found it at the waterfall of 
Craig-pwll-du.

Shropshire. — Mr. Westcombe also observed it on the Shrop- 
shire or Titterstone Clee hill ; and it has been found near the 
town of Ludlow by Mr. Westcott. 

Staffordshire. — Mr. Pinder gives me Pidge hill and Made- 
ley manor as stations where he has observed it. 

Sussex. — Mr. Jenner discovered this fern in the great bog 
near Forest row, and has very obligingly supplied me with spe- 
cimens from this locality. 

Westmoreland. — Miss Beever and Mr. Pinder speak of this 
fern as of common occurrence in Westmoreland, at Ambleside, 
Grassmere &c. ; Mr. Hindson gives me Hutton roof and Cas- 
terton fell as habitats; and Mr. S. Thompson mentions Dufton 
and Shap fells. 

Yorkshire. — In this county the Beech Fern occurs in a great 
number of stations, and in most instances in abundance. Mr. 
Hardy gives me Sheffield as a habitat ; Mr. Tatham, Settle ; Mr. 
S. Gibson, Hebden bridge ; Mr. Watson, Halifax ; Mr. Spruce, 
Scawton howle, near Helmesley, Buttercrambe moor, Lang with 
lane, Teesdale &c.; Mr. Wilson, Ingleborough ; Mr. Pinder and 
Mr. Ibbotson, Bolton-abbey woods : and besides these I find 
recorded in the ‘Botanist’s Guide’ and Baines’s ‘Flora of York- 
shire,’ Castle Howard, Hornby, Oldfield by Ripon, Hallow gill 
by Copgrove, w^ood in Soyland below Kebroyd mill, Wensley 
dale, Penhill, Bellerby moor, Shibden dale, Ogden dough, vale 
of Todmorden, &c. 

Isle of Man. — Professor E. Forbes has found it in this island. 

In Scotland this fern seems to be much more generally distri- 
buted than in England, although from dearth of information the 
list of localities is less copious than the English list. 

Aberdeenshire. — Mr. Watson informs me he has found it on 
mountains about Braemar and Castleton. 

Argyleshire. — 1 observed it at Inverary, Oban, Isle of Mull, 
Ballahulish and in the Pass of Glencroe ; Mr. Babington obtained 
it at Crinnan. 

Dumbartonshire. — I saw it at Luss, Tarbet, Arroquhar, and 
several other places on the banks of Loch Lomond and Loch 
liong; Mr. Gourlie has found it on Ben Voirlich. 

Dumfriesshire. — Mr. Babington found it at Jardine hall, and 
Mr. Cruickshank at Drumlanrig and on the Rae hills.

Edinburghshire. — Dr. Greville has collected it on the Pent- 
land hills. 

Fifeshire. — Found near Dunfermline by Professor Balfour. 

Forfarshire. — Mr. Watson records it as growing on Clova. 

Invernesshire. — Mr. W. Thompson has observed it at Aberar- 
der, ten miles south of Inverness; it was small near the road- 
side, but of great size and beauty at the waterfall of Nairn, in 
front of the shooting-lodge : and Mr. Watson found it on Ben 
Aulder, at Dalwhinnie, and on Ben Nevis. 

Kirkcudbrightshire.— Mr. Cruickshank informs me he finds 
it in the Dalskairth woods. 

Lanarkshire. — I saw it in the utmost profusion in the woods 
at the falls of the Clyde, also at the waterfalls themselves, Boni- 
ton, Corra Lyn and Stone Byers ; and Mr. Gourlie gives me Cm- 
therland as a locality. 

Moray. — B ev. G. Gordon, 

Perthshire. — I observed it near Tyndrum, Killin and Cal- 
lender, and about Lochs Dochart, Tay, Vennachar, Katrine and 
Achray ; Mr. Gourlie has found it on Ben Lawers ; and Mr. Wat- 
son on this mountain, at Dalnacardoch, and Lochernehead. 

Renfrewshire. — Mr. Gourlie has observed it at Gourock. 

Bosshire. — Mr. Watson found it near Kessock. 

Sutherland. — Found by Mr. Watson near the Ferry-house, 
at the east end of Loch Errboll. 

Shetland Isles. — Mr. Edmonston informs me it occurs spar- 
ingly on the North Marm, in Shetland. 

In Ireland Polypodium Phegopteris is a rare fern : I never had 
the good fortune to find it, although I searched in almost every 
county : when present it occurs in small quantities, and rarely 
attains that beautiful luxuriance which renders it so attractive 
an object in England, Wales and Scotland. 

Antrim. — Mr. W. Thompson informs me it was found by the 
late Mr. Templeton, on the banks of the Glenarve river, half a 
mile from Cushendall ; and Mr. Moore found it at several moun- 
tain rills and waterfalls in this county. 

Donegal. — Mr. Mackay says it occurs at the waterfall above 
Lough Eske, in this county. 

Down. — - Mr. Thompson informs me it was found by the late

Mr. Templeton on Slieve Bignian (2449 feet), and on rough 
ground two miles south of Slieve Croob ; Mr. Thompson gather- 
ed it on the Black mountain above Tolly more park, in 1836. 

Kerry. — Dr. Taylor has found it in the marshes near Mr. 
Herbert’s house at Mucruss ; and Mr. Moore between Killarney 
and Kenmare, 

Londonderry. — Found in Ness glen by the late Mr. Templeton. 

Louth, — Mr. Thompson gathered specimens on Carlingford 
mountain in 1836 ; it appears, from the MS. notes of the late 
Mr. Templeton, that it was first found in this locality by Dr. 
Robert Brown. 

Wicklow. — Mr. Mackay has found it at Powerscourt water- 
fall ; several botanists have recorded this habitat, which seems 
the most abundant one in the island. 

The geographical range of this species is not well ascertained: 
it is included in every European list, and might be expected to 
grow in the corresponding latitudes of Asia, but I am not aware 
of its having been recorded as an inhabitant of that continent, 
or of Africa. The North- American Polypodium connectile^ for 
specimens of which I am indebted to Mr. Boott and Mr. Lea, 
is so similar that I can scarcely assent to the opinion of that 
plant being distinct as a species. 

The figures of this fern do not appear to me so satisfactory as 
its marked character seems to require, for it is not only a most 
graceful, but a peculiarly well-marked fern ; its long naked stem, 
triangular form, marginal clusters of capsules, and the unusual 
position and complete separation of its lowest pair of pinnae, 
are very strRing diagnostics. In ‘ English Botany ’ it seems to 
have been figured twice, first under the name of Aspidium The- 
lypteris^- and subsequently as Polypodium PhegopterisA In 
Bolton’s ‘ Filices’ % the figure is far from characteristic, and Mr. 
Francis § seems to have figured an extra-European fern in its 
stead ; as the European species never has the pinnae so com- 
pletely divided as he has represented them. 

The English name of Beech Fern, derived from the specific

BEECH FERN.

name of Phegopteris, seems very inappropriate, as was observed 
by Sir J. E. Smith, and I feel quite at a loss to discover the rea- 
son for either having been employed : both of them convey an 
obviously incorrect impression, as neither the character nor lo- 
calities of the fern have any connection with the beech tree. 
Nearly all authors are agreed on the scientific name of this spe- 
cies, and have referred it to the genus Polypodium, distinguished 
by circular clusters of capsules, and by the total absence of an 
involucre ; but this character can only be applied in doubt to this 
and the following species, for Roth, than whom we have had no 
more careful or accurate observer, unhesitatingly states that both 
species possess an involucre, and he therefore refers them both 
to his genus PolystichumJ^ 

This involucre I have hitherto been unable to detect ; still al- 
though the presence or absence of an involucre may remain a 
question for future investigation, it must be admitted by all bo- 
tanists capable of forming an opinion, that the species before us 
would associate much more naturally with Oreopteris and The- 
lypteris than with the common polypody, its present congener. 

The roots of the beech fern are black and fibrous, its rhizoma 
wiry, tough and creeping. The fronds are thrown up in May, 
rising on erect, succulent, and very brittle stems, clothed with a 
few pale scattered scales. I have taken some pains to represent 
these young fronds at page 115, in every stage of development. 
They unfold with wonderful rapidity, attain perfection in July, 
and are destroyed by the early frosts on the approach of winter. 
The position of the frond is at first nearly horizontal, afterwards 
pendulous ; its size varies from that of the frond represented in

the figure (fig. a) to nine inches in length, exclusive of the na- 
ked part of the stem, which is usually twice as long as the frond. 



The figure of the frond is triangular and acute at the apex ; 
it is pinnate, the pinnae being pinnatifid, linear, and very acute 
at the apex ; the lower pair of pinnae are turned back from the 
apex of the frond ; they are united to the stem by the midrib 
only : the remaining pinnae point forwards, and are united to the 
stem by their entire diameter, and also to each other : the 
fronds, including their stem, are pale green and hirsute ; they 
are fertile only. 

The lateral veins of the pinnules are few in number, alternate, 
almost invariably undivided, and extend to the margin, each 
bearing a circular cluster of capsules near its extremity ; these 
clusters consequently form a submarginal series ; they are of a 
brown colour. In one of the detached pinnules in the cut (fig. b) 
will be seen the position of the veins, and the attachment of 
the capsules ; in the other (fig. c) the clusters of capsules are 
represented in their natural situation. 


OAK FERN. 


123 



OAK FERN, [one third the natural size). 
Polypodium Dryopterts, Linneus. 

The Oak Fern is one of our most elegant and delicate spe- 
cies : like the last, it is almost entirely confined to wild and 
mountainous districts, wet woods, and the vicinity of waterfalls. 
On the most bleak and exposed mountains it ascends to a con- 
siderable height, sheltering beneath ledges of rock, and under 
masses of stone. It principally occurs in our northern English, 
our Welch and our Scotch counties, but in Ireland is a fern of 
excessive rarity. 

The range of this fern, as regards England and Wales, some- 
what corresponds with that of Polypodium Phegopteris, but 
appears to be more restricted ; for so great a doubt attends the 
recorded locality in Devonshire, that it must be omitted until 
confirmed by fresh observation. If the island were divided by 
an oblique but irregular line, composed of the rivers Trent and 
Severn, and the Bristol channel, we shall find P. Dryopteris 
present in most of the counties to the north-west of this line, 
and nearly absent from those to the south-east ; this is the more

remarkable, since many situations, especially in Cornwall, De- 
von, Somerset, Dorset and Wilts, seem peculiarly adapted to the 
growth of such a fern. I have given a list of the counties in 
which I have ascertained its presence, together with a few 
localities. 

Anglesea. — I have seen specimens from this county, but do 
not know the locality. 

Brecknockshire, — Mr. Ralfs has found it in woods near Bre- 
con, and at Trecastle ; Mr. Lees at Pont Henryd and Capel 
Colboen ; and Mr. Westcombe near Ystrad Felltree. 

Caernarvonshire. — I have observed it near Bangor; at 
Bhaidr-y-Wenol ; in the pass of Llanberis; at Cwm Idwell &c. 

Cheshire. — Mr. Wilson has observed it of very large size 
about two miles south of Warrington.

Lodore, near Keswick ; Mr. Heysham near Honister crags, and 
in the village of Grange in Borrowdale ; Mr. Binder at Cal- 
der bridge, Ponsonby screes, Wasdale &c. ; and Mr. Winch 
gives Ashness gill, Scale force, and Gillsland, as localities. 

Denbighshire. — I observed it scattered over a rock on the 
left hand by the road-side just leaving Llangollen for the Capel 
Curig road ; the plants were small and discoloured, and the 
leaves convolute. 

Derbyshire. — In the ‘ Botanist’s Guide ’ the rocks about 
Pleasley forges, and Chinley hill near Chapel-le-Frith, are re- 
corded as localities. 

Durham. — Mr. Watson gives me this county as a habitat, on 
the authority of Mr. R. B. Bowman ; and Mr. Winch found it 
in Scots’ wood and Walbottle denes. 

Flintshire. — I have a memorandum that it has been found in 
this county near the town of St. Asaph. 

Glamorganshire. — Mr. Dillwyn has found it about Pont 
Nedd Vechn, and Mr. Lees at the waterfalls of Scwd-y-Gladis 
and Cilhepste ; and I once received specimens from the vici- 
nity of Merthyr Tydfil. 

Gloucestershire. — Withering has recorded its occurrence

in woods, north-east of the road up Frocester hill ; and Mr. 
Lees informs me it grows in the forest of Dean, south-east of 
the rocks of New weir, on the Wje, by a path through the 
woods towards Staunton. 

Herefordshire. — Mr. Lees has observed it in great profusion 
by the side of a shady path in a wood or copse on the southern 
side of the Teme, leading from a wooden bridge over the river 
in Mr. Knight’s grounds, and not far from Downton castle ; I 
have found it near Aymestree quarry, and in immense profusion 
in Shobden-hill woods : in the latter locality it covers acres of 
ground, is of small size, and all the divisions of the frond are 
convex or convolute. 

Lancashire. — Mr. Gibson gives me Broad-bank, near Colne, 
as a locality, and has obligingly given me specimens, which are 
of the convolute form ; Mr. Wilson, Dean-church dough ; Mr. 
Finder, Marsden, near Colne, and Padiham brook ; Mr. Sidebo- 
tham, Mere-clough and Cotteril-clough ; Mr. Simpson, Lancas- 
ter ; Miss Beever, Coniston ; and Dr. Wood, Ashworth wood. 

Merionethshire. — I observed it near the base of Plinlymmon.

Staffordshire. — Mr. Finder informs me he has found it in 
Trenlham park ; Mr. Beynon, in the grounds of the Rev. Thos. 
Gisborne, of Yoxall lodge ; and Mr. Carter, that it occurs abun- 
dantly in a lane leading from Oakamoor to Cotton hall, and 
also on stone walls by the road-side, near Cotton hall.

county ; Mr. S. Thompson finds it at Dufton ; Miss Beever at 
Ambleside ; Mr. Hindson at Hutton roof and Casterton fell. 

Worcestershire. — Mr. Lees finds it plentifully on the Mal- 
vern hills, in a stony ravine between the north and end hills,

ster rocks ; Mr. Gibson near Hebden bridge ; Mr. Finder in 
Bolton-abbey woods, from which locality he has presented me 
with fine specimens ; Mr. Watson in woods near Halifax ; Mr. 
Backhouse in Castle Howard park. Whits ton cliff, near Thirsk ; 
and various parts of the North and West Ridings ; Mr. Wilson 
on Ingleborough ; Mr. Ibbotson in Rivaulx woods, Luilesworth 
vale, and Cave-hole woods ; a number of other localities are 
recorded — as Brimham rocks, Teesdale, Bickering, Whitby, 
Richmond, Helmsley, Birks’ wood. North Dean wood. Button 
park and other woods near Halifax, Dallowgill, Hackfall, Saw- 
ley moor, &c. 

In Scotland Polypodinm Dryopteris is very generally distri- 
buted ; I have ascertained the following stations. 

Aberdeenshire.— Mr. Watson informs me he obtained it near 
Castletown, in Braemar, and on the adjacent mountains. 

Argyleshire. — When wandering in the ravines between Lochs 
Awe and Etive, I saw this fern in greater profusion than ever 
before or since ; I also observed it in many other parts of the 
same county ; and Mr. Gourlie gives me Brodick and the Isle 
of Arran as localities, on the authority of Mr. Adamson. 

Dumbartonshire. — I observed it in several places near Loch 
Lomond ; and Mr. Gourlie has found it on Ben Voirlich. 

Dumfriesshire. — Mr. Cruickshank informs me he has found 
it at Drumlanrigge, and on the Rae hills.

Edinburghshire. — Mr. Watson lias observed it in the Au- 
chindenny woods. 

Forfarshire. — Mr. Gardiner has found it abundantly on the 
Sidlaw hills ; and Mr. Watson on the Clova mountains. 

Invernesshire. — Mr. W. Thompson says, “ This fern grows 
about Aberarder, where I was much interested in observing that 
at Glen Marson it grew plentifully, when protected by the shel- 
tering canopy of the fine old junipers (which are abundant there), 
and nowhere else than beneath their shade : it was on the 13th 
September, 1842, and all the Dryopteris was of an autumnal 
browm hue. On the 17th of the month, in a more open locality, 
about the waterfall of the Nairn, the plant was in the highest 
perfection, displaying its lovely and tender green fronds.” Mr. 
Watson found it on Ben Aulder and at Dalwhinnie. 

Kincardineshire. — Mr. Watson informs me, on the authority 
of specimens distributed by the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, 
that it has been found at Inglis-Maldie. 

Kirkcudbrightshire. — Mr. Cruickshank informs me he has 
found this fern in Dalskairth and Glen woods, and other places 
in the county. 

Lanarkshire. — Mr. Gourlie has observed it on the banks of 
the Kelvin ; and I have seen it in several places near the falls 
of the Clyde. 

Perthshire. — Mr. Gourlie has found it on Ben Lawers, and 
Mr. Watson on the Breadalbane mountains, on moors about 
Dalnacardoch, and about Killin ; I observed it in several places 
near the last-named towm. 

Renfrewshire. — Mr. Gourlie informs me he has found it at 
Gourock and Port Glasgow. 

Rosshire. — Mr. Watson informs me that it was observed in 
this county by the Rev. G. Gordon. 

SuTHERLANDSHiRE. — Mr. Watson observed it near the Ferry- 
house, on the east side of Loch Erboll. 

This fern has not been observed by Mr. Clouston in Orkney, 
by Mr. Edmonston in Shetland, or by Professor Forbes in the 
Isle of Man. 

In Ireland this is the rarest of all our ferns. 

Antrim. — Mr. Moore found a single plant on Knochlayd.

Galway.— Mr. Mackay gives Mam Turk as a locality.— 
Hihernica. 

Kerry.— Mr. Woodward informs me there is a single frond in 
Dr. Taylor’s herbarium, labelled Mucruss. 

The geographical range of this species is very extensive : it 
occurs in every country of Europe from the North Cape to Gib- 
raltar, and extends eastward into Turkey, Russia, and Northern 
Asia, and southward into Africa : it is also found throughout 
the United States of North America. It ascends to the exposed 
summits of mountains, especially if dry, almost reaching the 
extreme limits of vegetation, and yet luxuriates in the warmest 
woods if amply provided with shelter and moisture. I know of 
no fern enjoying so great a range of latitude, longitude, and 
elevation. 

The figures of this fern, like those of the last, are less charac- 
teristic than its remarkable form would lead us to expect ; those 
in Bolton’s ‘ Filices’ and ‘ English Botany’ f are better than 
most, but that in Mr. Francis’s ‘Analysis’! is incorrect as 
regards outline and position, the triple character of the frond is 
not w^ell expressed : that in ‘ Flora Danica ’ is also bad, and is 
supposed by some subsequent authors to have been intended for 
Lastrcea dilatatcu 

The name of Oak Fern, derived from Dryopteris, appears as 
inapplicable as that of Beech Fern to the species last described, 
and is adopted in deference to the opinions of others. The 
scientific name of Polypodium Dryopteris has been employed by 
all authors of repute, Roth alone excepted, who describes it as 
having an involucre nearly similar to that which he assigns to 
P, Phegopteris, and he consequently refers it to his genus Po- 
lystichiim,^

OAK FERN. 


129 


The roots are black and fibrous ; the rhizoma black, wiry and 
creeping, often, when long established, forming a dense matted 
mass. The young fronds make their appearance in March and 
April, each at first resembling three little balls on wires, pre- 
senting a very curious and excellent diagnostic ; these three 
balls gradually unfold, and display the triple character of the 
frond. The fronds soon arrive at maturity ; I have found them 
loaded with ripe seed as early as June : before winter they have 
usually entirely disappeared. The common stem is very slen- 
der, dark purple and shining, and is frequently twice as long as 
the frond ; it has a few scattered scales towards the base. The 
frond is triple, or composed of three distinct triangular portions, 
each of which has a short but distinct stem, and these three 
unite with the common stem at an obtuse angle, as represented 
in the figure at page 123. Each division of the frond is pinnate, 
and the pinnae are opposite, pinnate at the base, and pinnati- 
fid towards the centre, terminating in a somewhat acute apex ; 
the basal pinnules are sessile, and of nearly equal size, so that 
the four occurring at each union of the pinnae with the stem, 
form a cross. The mid-vein of each pinnule or ultimate division 
is sinuous, and the lateral veins are alternate and mostly simple, 
each terminates at the margin, and generally bears a circular 
cluster of dark brown capsules near its extremity : in some spe- 
cimens these clusters are so densely crowded as to form a margi- 
nal line, in others they are scattered and very distant. The 
fronds are of a most vivid and beautiful green, in this respect 
surpassing every other species with which I am acquainted : 
when of full growth and mature, they are alvrays fertile. In 
many specimens the frond is much more divided than the one 
which I have selected for my figure and description; and in 
such instances the veins and clusters of capsules partake of the 
subdivision. It should also be observed that the two lateral 
divisions of the fronds may, without impropriety, be termed the 
first pair of pinnae, in which case their divisions would be pin- 
nules, and not pinnae as I have here denominated them, from 
a desire to avoid a confusion of terms.

the rocks close to the path by the side of the Wye, between 
New Weir and Symond’s Yat, and among the rocks at Lydbrook, 
in the Forest of Dean, also in a ravine of the Cotswolds, and 
abundantly on the glacis of the rock at Clevecloud ; Mr. Buck-

observed it, growing with Dryopteris, on Ingleborough ; and Mr. 
Watson gives me Arnclilfe and Gordale as habitats, on the au- 
thority of Mr. R. B. Bowman. 

It has been found, according to Sadler, in Hungary, Germany 
and France, but in no other country of Europe, neither am I 
aware of its existence in Asia or Africa ; but I possess a frond 
from the State of New York, and Sadler also gives it without a 
doubt as a native of North America. 

We are indebted to Bolton for first noticing and describing 
this fern, which he treated as a variety of P. Dryopteris. I 
have observed,” says this author, “ a variety of this plant grow- 
ing in White Scars, near Ingleton, and in the Peak of Derby- 
shire, wherein the rib is taller, more firm, hard and robust, white 
and opaque the leaves larger, the number of parts greater, and 
the largest of the lobes are again partly lobed, or divided down 
half-way to the middle rib : this variety I have figured, tab. 1, 
fig. 1.”^ The plant, however, was named and characterized as 
a species by Sir J. E. Smith ; his description is in these words : 

Frond three-branched ; branches doubly pinnate, erect, rather 
rigid ; segments obtuse, somewhat crenate. Masses of capsules 
crowded, finally confluent. ^ ^ Root creeping, but stouter 

and less extended than in the preceding species (P. Dryopteris), 
Frond more firm and rigid ; its stalk more scaly about the lower 
part. All the three branches upright, smaller than the last, rigid, 
and not loosely spreading. Masses of capsules more crowded, 
finally in some degree confluent, and of a browner hue.”f Sad- 
ler admits this species with doubt, and other continental authors, 
with one or two exceptions, have left it unnoticed. Our British 
authors. Hooker and Babington, admit it as a species ; the latter 
gives the following description, which, it may be observed, com- 
prises diagnostics of more value than any pointed out by Bolton 
or Smith. “ Fronds subternate, glandular -mealy, lower branches 
pinnate ; pinnae pinnatifid, obtuse, the uppermost nearly entire j

sori marginal. Very different in habit from the preceding (P. 
Dryopteris), and always covered with very minute stalked glands, 
giving a mealy character to the surface. Frond not so decidedly 
trifid, the lower branches being much smaller in proportion to 
the middle one ; all the three erect, rigid.”^ Mr. Wilson, ^vhose 
authority in British ferns is certainly inferior to no one’s, also 
considers the present species distinct from P. Pryopteris, “ I 
consider these plants,” says Mr. Wilson, to be quite distinct, 
the former [P. calcareurri\ having truly the erect habit which 
Smith describes ; I believe also that the pubescence is constantly 
present in P. calcareum. The two species are generally found 
in different habitats, but in a wood on the side of Ingleborough, 
as you go to Weathercote, they are found in company. I have 
cultivated them side by side for many years, with their respective 
characters unchan ged.”f Mrs. Biley, of Papplewick, near Not- 
tingham, has written a few lines on the same subject, which I 
shall take the liberty of quoting. The pubescence, which is 
one distinguishing character of P. calcareum, is a beautiful mi- 
croscopic object, each slender stem supporting a globular head, 
but this pubescence soon dries, so that only on freshly gathered 
specimens can it be fully perceived or accurately examined. 
Though we found P. Pryopteris frequently in Wales, we never 
met with P. calcareum there ; and though, like Mr. Wilson, we 
have cultivated them side by side for years, we can also testify 
that their respective characters remain unchanged.’’^ In letters 
received from the Rev. Mr. Bree, and Mr. Cameron of Birming- 
ham, opinions very similar to those now quoted are expressed, 
both these excellent botanists regarding P. calcareum as a truly 
distinct species. 

The figure and description of Pryopteris Tragi in Gerarde,§ 
as quoted by Smith, || is apparently intended for this species : 
there is a tolerably characteristic figure in Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’1[ 
and also in ‘ English Botany the last under the name of P. 
calcareum, but that in Francis’ ^Analysis ’ft is evidently drawn

from P. Dryopteris, the form of the un expanded fronds being 
characteristic of that species only. 

The roots are fibrous, and in all respects resemble those of 
P. Dryopteris : the rhizoma, described as the root by Smith, in 
the passage previously cited, is dark brown, creeping, and some- 
what stouter than in P. Dryopteris. The fronds make their ap- 
pearance in May, and their habit and mode of unfolding differs 
from that of P. Dryopteris ; the three 
portions of the frond never assume the 
appearance of three little balls, which 
I have noticed as an excellent diag- 
nostic of P. Dryopteris^ but all the 
pinnules appear somewhat globular, 
the first pair of pinnae differing from 
the second in little else than magnitude. 

I have taken great pains to give a faith- 
ful representation of some young fronds : 

I divided the stem of each on account of 
its inconvenient length, and laying them 
on the block before me, made an accu- 
rate copy both as regards size and figure 
(p. 131). The stems are much stouter 
and more succulent than those of P. 

Dryopteris, and I think also more scaly; 
they are of the same dull green as the 
frond, whereas those of P. Dryopteris are frequently purple or 
blackish, and have a more wiry appearance. The frond attains 
its full development in July, and matures its seed in August. 

The form of the expanded frond is nearly triangular, the base 
being shorter than the sides, and altogether not unlike that of 
the common Brakes ; the pinnas are opposite, the first pair always 
have a short naked stem ; the second pair frequently have this, 
but not invariably ; and the naked stem of the first pair of pin- 
nae is always much shorter and more slender than the main stem 
between the first and second pair, whereas in P. Dryopteris 
these three stems are of nearly equal length and thickness ; the 
pinnae are pinnate, the pinnules deeply pinnatifid ; all parts of 
the frond are covered with the mealy pubescence described by

Mr. Babington : it consists of a number of minute, stalked 
glands. The bend, so observable in P. Dryopteris at the point 
of union of its three branches, is much less marked in P. calca- 
reum. The lateral veins of the lobes of the pinnules are undi- 
vided, and the capsules are borne in circular clusters near the 
termination of each, as in both the preceding species. These 
clusters become confluent in the autumn, and form a continuous 
marginal series.

KAY’S WOODSIA {natural size). 
Woodsia Ilvensis, Smith, ^ Hooker, Babington. 


This is one of the rarest of our ferns : it roots in the fissures 
of rocks, in the most bleak and exposed mountainous regions : 
it has hitherto occurred to botanists in two counties in England, 
one in Wales, and one in Scotland. 

* The true Ilvensis of Linneus is figured on the opposite page, from a spe- 
cimen in Mr. Woodward’s herbarium, said to have been found in Wales; but 
as some little difficulty arose in tracing its history I prefer figuring in illustra- 
tion of Smith’s Woodsia Kwwm, specimens whose claim to be considered British 
admits of no question.

Caernakvonshire. — I think there can be no doubt that this 
fern is the Filix alpina found by Dr. Kichardson on a moist 
rock called Clogwyn-y-Garnedd, one of the highest points of 
Snowdon,” as recorded in Ray’s ‘ Synopsis.’* Bolton appears 
to have figured the same fern, from the same locality, under the 
name of Acrostichum Ilvense. Mr. Wilson found it near Llyn- 
y-cwn, on Glyder Vawr, in 1824 j and it has since been seen by 
Mr. Borrer, Mr. Roberts of Bangor, and I believe several other 
botanists, directed to the spot by Mr. Wilson. I am indebted 
to the kindness of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Pamplin for specimens 
from the Llyn-y-cwn locality, but I believe there are no speci- 
mens now in existence from Clogwyn-y-Garnedd ; the two fronds 
represented at a, on the preceding page, are from this station. 

Durham. — Mr. Winch, in his ‘Flora of Northumberland and 
Durham,’ gives these localities, “ Near the summit of some bold 
basaltic rocks, called Falcon Clints, about ten miles west of 
Middleton, in Teesdale, Mr. S. Halestone. At the foot of ba- 
saltic rocks, on the Durham side of the river Tees, about two 
hundred yards below Cauldron Snout, Mr. J. Backhouse.^'* Mr. 
Winch observes that these localities must be near together. — 
Mr. Simpson observed the plant there in 1838, and has kindly 
presented me with a frond. “ Recrossing the bridge,” says Mr. 
Simpson, “ we pursued the course of the stream, which, almost 
immediately below the Snout, takes a sudden turn, and thus we 
found our track hemmed in by the over-laden Tees on our right 
hand, and the lofty basaltic rocks called Falcon Clints on our 
left. My eye was now anxiously directed to the face of these 
rocks, to discover, if possible, the chief object in taking our 
present course — Woodsia Ilvensis. Rain now began to fall 
heavily, and the wind, which had been all day very tempestuous, 
bore it against us so as to render observation, either of locality 
or objects, very imperfect. However, after tracing as near as I 
can judge about 400 yards, I espied some small specks of green 
through the broken fragments of a stream which poured over 
the Clints, and under which I soon stood, pulling hastily the 
patches I had seen, and these, to my delight, proved to be two

small plants of the Woodsia^ mixed with a few fronds of Asple- 
nium viride and Cystopteris fragilis.’‘'‘^ Mr. King found several 
specimens in 1841. ‘‘Here,” says Mr. King, “I cast around 
many an anxious look for Woodsia Ilvensis ; at length, after 
much searching, and a good wetting from the drip of the water 
from the huge basaltic rocks, to my great joy I espied two small 
plants, which were instantly secured ; a little farther on we saw 
three more under a bush of Prunus Padus, but, not liking to 
destroy the plant, we left the roots of these in the crevice of the 
rock where they were growing.”f Mr. J. Backhouse, jun., Mr. 
Babington, Mr. Borrer, and other botanists, have repeatedly 
verified this Falcon Clints station ; and I have to acknowledge 
my thanks to these botanists for the opportunity of examining 
and comparing specimens, and to Mr. Kippist for a specimen 
gathered in the same locality by Mr. Woods : the five fronds 
represented at h are from this station. 

Forfarshire. — I am indebted to Dr. Greville for a specimen 
from the Clova mountains ; and the very fine specimen repre- 
sented at fig. c was gathered in August, 1836, in Glen Phee, by 
Mr. Wilson, who most obligingly favored me wdth the drawing, 
of which that figure is a fac simile copy. 

Westmoreland.^ — The following interesting note appeared in 
the 16th number of ‘The Phytologist.’ “On the 17th of 8th 
month [August] 1798, my father gathered a single frond of a 
fern from Crosby-Ravensworth Church, Westmoreland. Being 
unable to name it he showed it to several botanists in London, 
who could not decide what it was ; Lewfis Dillwyn at length 
sent it to Sir J. E. Smith, who returned the specimen labelled 
as follows : —

The original specimen is now in my possession, with Sir J. E. 
Smith’s autograph ; the frond is 35 - inches in length from the 
bottom of the rachis to the apex, and about two inches from

the lowest pinnae to the apex. The church has been pulled 
down and rebuilt within the last few years. — Silvanus Thomp- 
sons''^ I have not seen this specimen, and therefore entertain a 
doubt whether it belong to this species or the next. 

The figures of this fern in Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’f ‘ English Bo- 
tany,’! and Mr. Francis’s ^ Analysis,’^ give but a very imperfect 
idea of the plant; the latter is particularly unlike. Of the 
continental figures I entertain so much doubt as to their repre- 
senting our British plant, that I forbear quoting them. The 
doubt, of course, is equally applicable to nomenclature, and I 
name the species as Woodsia Ilvensis of our British authors, 
without attempting to prove it the Acrostichum Ilvense of Lin- 
neus. I have no doubt, as before stated, that it is the Filix al- 
pina^ Pedicularis rubroi foliis subtus villosis of Bay, although 
this description is referred by Sir J. E. Smith to the plant I have 
next described. I am extremely gratified to find that Mr. Wil- 
son entertains a similar opinion. In a letter just received, Mr. 
Wilson says, “ I cannot help thinking that the synonym in Ray’s 
‘ Synopsis,’ usually applied to the other species, belongs to this 
fern, notwithstanding that in the locality pointed out by Ray, on 
Snowdon, I find only W. hyperborea^ which I have never seen 
there ^foliis sex circiter digitis longis^ and which less resem- 
bles Pedicularis S'' Ray’s description appears to me to lay stress 
on all the points in which the present plant chiefly differs from 
the next. There can be scarcely a doubt that the plant now 
under consideration is the Polypodium arvonicum of Withering, 
whose description — ‘‘ Leafits spear-shaped, wing-cleft, hairy un- 
derneath ; stem hairy” || — is peculiarly apt. I am indebted to the 
kindness of Dr. Robert Brown, for specimens gathered by him- 
self in the north of Europe, of the true Acrosiichum Ilvense of 
Linneus, and these, while agreeing exactly with the authentic 
Linnean specimen in the herbarium of the Linnean Society, 
differ so much from the British plant that I hesitate to pronounce 
them identical. Should the British plant prove distinct, I beg to 
propose it should bear the name of Woodsia Raiana. The doubt

as to this species being distinct from TV. alpina ( W, hyperhorea of 
Smith) will again be noticed under my description of that species. 

With regard to the genus to which these little plants are 
referrible, considerable difference of opinion appears to pre- 
vail. Linneus, Bolton, Liljeblad, and Hudson, place them 
in the genus Acrostichum : Withering, Sowerby, Willdenow, 
Sprengel, Schkuhr, Wahlenberg, and Presl, in the genus Poly- 
podium ; Lamarck and Decandolle in the genus Ceterach : 
Smith, Hooker, Sadler, and Babington, in the genus Woodsia, 
instituted by Dr. Robert Brown purposely to receive them. The 
description of this genus was published in the eleventh volume 
of the Linnean Transactions,* and its distinguishing character 
consists in the peculiar structure of the involucre, which is in- 
serted under the cluster of capsules, the attachment of which it 
surrounds, while its margin, as in the linear involucre of Pteris, 
already described, is split into a number of jointed capillary 
segments, which intermingle with the capsules, partially con- 
cealing them.f 

The roots are black, wiry, and sparingly branched : the rhi- 
zoma thick, tufted, and lasting many years : the stem is very 
distinctly jointed at a distance of three quarters of an inch from 
its junction with the rhizoma ; the articulation is swollen, 
and very obvious to the naked eye when the frond is mature ; 
at this point, as far as my observation has extended, separation 
generally takes place, the basal portion of each stem adhering 
to the rhizoma. This very interesting character, common to all 
plants of this genus, is well described by Wahlenberg, J whose 
observations I have quoted under my next species. The stem 
above this joint, and between the pinnae, is clothed with lance- 
olate scales, and shining jointed hairs : the form of the frond is 
lanceolate and pinnate : the pinnae are in pairs, and generally 
opposite, oblong, obtuse, deeply lobed, and in some specimens 
pinnatifid, in which case the lobes are crenate, as in figure c. 
The upper surface of the frond appears quite smooth to the 
naked eye, but under a lens of high power, a few long bristle-

like scales, are observable, all of them pointing outwards. The 
under surface appears pubescent, and with the aid of a lens this 
pubescence is found to consist, first of very long, pointed, nar- 
row scales, which are more particularly abundant about the mid- 
rib ; secondly^ of jointed and shining hairs, which are scattered 
nearly over the whole surface ; and thirdly^ of the capillary 
segments of the involucres, which are also jointed and shining. 
The capsules are placed in circular clusters near the margins of 
the lobes or pinnules ; they are frequently concealed by the pu- 
bescence already described ; when arrived at maturity they be- 
come confluent, and occupy all the margins of the pinnules. 

The vignette below is intended to represent C wm Idwell : Llyn-

fern now described, is situate just beyond this rampart of rock.

This is one of the rarest ferns in Britain ; it has only occurred

Caernarvonshire. — This fern was found by Mr. Wilson 
on Clogwyn-y-Garnedd, one of the precipices of Snowdon 
which faces the east, as observed by that botanist, on whose

authority Smith corrected the error of Ray and others, who 
described this precipice as facing the north-west : the locality, 
it will be observed, is that pointed out by Ray for the preceding 
species. 

Perthshire. — According to Smith and other authorities, Mr. 
Dickson, Mr. G. Don, and the Rev. Dr. Stuart, found this plant 
on Ben Lawers. Mr. Wilson informs me he found it on Ben 
Lawers, Mael-dun-Crosk, Craig-Challiach, and other mountains, 
in 1827, and again on Ben Lawers in 1836; and Mr. Watson 
gives me Craig-Challiach, on the authority of Mr. Maughan. 

On the continent of Europe it has been observed in Lapland, 
Sweden, Germany, Hungary, France and Spain. I am not aware 
of its occurrence in Asia or Africa, but in North America a 
closely approximate species has been found on the rocky moun- 
tains, which is, however, considered distinct by Dr. Robert 
Brown, who has described it under the name of Woodsia glabella. 

This little fern is excellently figured by Bolton,^ by Bauer 
(in illustration of Dr. Robert Brown’s paper in the Linnean 
Transactions), and by several continental authors. 

With regard to the specific name I have proposed a change, 
which may at first sight appear somewhat capricious, but which, 
when investigated, will I trust be found in accordance with the 
received principles of botanical nomenclature. The specific 
name of hyperhorea has been applied to this plant by Liljeblad, 
Swartz, Will denow. Brown, Wahlenberg, Smith, Hooker, and 
many other botanists ; indeed it seems so sanctioned by autho- 
rity, that it is not without great reluctance that I venture on the 
alteration which I will now attempt to justify. 

The first description that I can find of this fern is that in 
Bolton’s ‘Filices’ : it is under the name of Acrosticimm alpinum. 
“ The root of this little Acrostichum consists of a few black, 
hard branches, connected to a small head, and furnished with 
black, hard, capillary fibres. The rib of the first leaf, when full 
grown, is about three inches high, of a pale brownish-green co-

necessary to copy it, otherwise I should have done so with a view of confirming 
the specific name.

lour, slender and smooth, being quite destitute of hairs. Second 
leaves six or seven pairs, opposite below, alternate above, of a 
triangular figure, obtuse at the corners of three or four of the 
lower pairs, but all of equal size and remote, two or three of the 
upper gradually lessening and growing closer together. Lobes 
of the second leaves most commonly five, two on each side of 
the rib and one at the end ; they are of a roundish figure, grow 
close together, and are obscurely crenated round the margin. 
The colour on the upper side is a brownish kind of green ; the 
underside thickly covered with a brown hairy nap. The lower 
figure represents one of the second leaves as it appeared when 
a little magnified : the seed-vessels are disposed in three or four 
clusters on each lobe, partly hidden among the numerous strong 
brown hairy filaments, by which also the whole under side of the 
leaf, quite to the margin, is thickly covered. The specimen 
above described is very exactly figured on plate 42, and is a 
plant so perfectly distinct from the Acrostichum Ilvense, in its 
usual state, that it seems to me unreasonable to suppose them 
both of the same species. The Acrostichum Ilvense, described 
in the former part of this work, page 14, and accurately figured 
on plate 9, was brought from Snowdon. Oeder, in ^ Flora Da- 
nica,’ has given an excellent figure of the same plant, tab. 391, 
and the figure in Pluk. Phyt. tab. 179, fig. 4 (which is cited by 
Linneus in Flo. Suecica, ed. 2, No. 938), agrees pretty aptly with 
both Oeder’s and my own. But all are very different from the 
Acrostichum alpinum above described. The specimen figured 
on plate 42 was brought from Scotland, but the plant is also a 
native of South Britain, for in a volume of dried plants, col- 
lected by the late Mr. Knowlton, I have seen specimens of the 
same plant with this note in his own handwriting — ‘ From the 
mountains of Wales.’ From these and some other circumstances 
I am induced to think that two species of British ferns have 
been confounded together under the name of Acrostichum llvense, 
and I believe that future observation will confirm the truth now 
discovered.” 

T have quoted the description entire, in order to remove any 
doubt as to the plant now under consideration being identical 
with that he describes, although the testimony of Brown and 

L

Smith, who cite Bolton’s name as a synonyme, might perhaps be 
deemed sufficient to decide this branch of the enquiry. We 
then arrive at the question of date. Bolton’s work on the Bri- 
tish ferns, although paged continuously, was published in two 
parts, the first at Leeds in 1785, the second at Huddersfield in 
1790; Acrostichum alpinwm occurs in the second part.* The 
name of Acrostichum hyperhoreum was published by Liljeblad 
in the Stockholm Transactions for 1793, and is the authority 
quoted by Smith and others, Mr. Bennett has, however, shown 
me that the original description may be dated one year earlier : 
admitting this, we must still give Bolton a priority of two years, 
quite sufficient to decide a question of nomenclature, yet it is 
somewhat remarkable that Lamarck and Decandolle are the only 
authors who have adopted the specific name of olpinumA 
After so ample a description as that by Bolton, already quoted, 
it may perhaps be thought unnecessary to give one of my own, 
but I scarcely think myself justified in such a departure from 
my usual course as to omit it. The roots are black, wiry, and 
branched : the rhizoma is tufted, large in proportion to the en- 
tire plant, and apparently very enduring. The stems are slen- 
der and nearly smooth ; they have a few small, scattered, and 
pointed scales, and some very slender jointed hairs, amounting 
in a very young state to a fine pubescence, but both these appear 
to be easily removed, since in nearly all the mature dried speci- 
mens I have seen they were entirely wanting : the stem is arti- 
culated, like that of the preceding species, and 1 have a specimen 
which has two joints, a circumstance which I imagine of unu- 
sual occurrence. The shape of the frond is long, narrow, linear, 
and pinnate : the pinnae are perfectly separate, sometimes dis- 
tant, almost invariably alternate, and in shape somewhat trian- 
gular, the angles being rounded ; they are lobed, the lobes are 
five or seven in number and very obtuse ; the first superior lobe 
is sometimes considerably larger than the rest, and slightly 
notched ; the apex of the frond is pinnatifid and pointed : the 
margins and under surface of the pinnae are sparingly furnished 
with jointed hairs. The venation is rather anomalous ; no

147 


particular vein appears to possess a very decided superiority over 
the others ; they are occasionally simple, but generally divided 
into two or three branches ; they do not 
quite reach the margin of the pinna ; 
and the clusters of capsules, when pre- 
sent, are placed at their extremity : fig. a 
represents a pinna of the present species 
with the capsules in situ ; fig. h shows 
the venation, and the points of attachment 
of the capsules after their removal. It 
may also here be observed that fig. c 
represents a somewhat intermediate form 
from Scotland ; fig. d another from Llyn- 
y-cwn ; and fig. e a plant of the present 
species from Ben Lawers : the block was 
cut for the first edition, but represents the 
plant so accurately that I did not like to 
cancel it, although both species have been 
re-engraved from other specimens. 

Concerning the distinctness of species 
so similar as this and the preceding, much 
difference of opinion must always prevail. 

It will be seen, by my quotation from 
Bolton, that that author strongly insists 
on maintaining them as species. Sir J. 

E. Smith also considers them distinct ; he 
contrasts their characters in these words : 

Rather smaller than the foregoing, and 
less upright, with a more rusty aspect. 

Stalk less elastic. Leaflets shorter, round- 
er, with more rounded lobes, and broader 
at the base, not quite so deeply pinnatifid 



The 


two species 

appear to me to be very distinct, though similar.”^- Sadler gives 
them as distinct without a comment, but does not appear to me 
to distinguish them very cleverly by his descriptions.f Wahlen- 
berg insists on their distinctness, drawing an elaborate contrast

between them.* Lastly, Mr. Wilson remarks, I have never 
had the least difficulty in distinguishing these plants, the first 
by its ovate, the second by its oblong, pinnsB.f All these are 
weighty authorities, but on the other side I find others equally 
entitled to respect. Dr. Robert Brown observes, — These two 
plants are indeed so nearly related that I find myself unable to 
construct for them clear specific characters, and therefore, in 
proposing them here as distinct species, I am, from want of suf- 
ficient materials to determine the question, rather following the 
prevailing opinion than my own.”J Mr. Babington has treated 
them as forms of one species, and makes this observation. — 
“ Our plants appear to form but one species, although they put 
on three very different appearances.” § Mr. J. Backhouse, jun., 
after informing me that he collected some specimens of Woodsia 
at Falcon Clints, proceeds to say, — “ I brought home some spe- 
cimens with roots, and when I planted them they agreed in every 
particular with W, Ilvensis : the first fronds they produced after 
I had planted them were quite different, and had assumed ex- 
actly the form of the Scottish W. hyperhoreay and they are now 
(26th of 11th mo. 1842) changing back again to Ilvensis, so that 
I have no doubt the forms are only two varieties of the same 
species.” Mr. S. Thompson, of York, has seen the plants in 
question, and quite coincides in the opinion here expressed.

BRITTLE FERN.

In the following counties this fern appears widely distributed, 
and in certain localities it is abundant. 


Throughout the Highlands of Scotland it is a very common 
fern, but exhibits a constant preference for walls and bridges : 
in the lowlands it is comparatively of rare occurrence. 

In Ireland it is a rare fern. Mr. Mackay says that it occurs 
on “ rocks and walls in the mountainous parts of the southern, 
northern, and western counties,”* but he gives no precise loca- 
lities. 

Antrim. — In the MS. notes of the late Mr. Templeton there 
is a record of the variety dentata being found by himself “ on 
the rocks of Carrickfergus river, near the waterfall, June 11,1811.” 

Down. — Mr. Thompson informs me he observed it on the 
Black mountain, above Tollymore park, in 1836. 

Kerry. — I am indebted to Mr. Woodward for specimens from 
Brandon hill ; he gathered it at an elevation of 3150 feet : he 
also observed it on cliffs above the Punchbowl at Mangerton, at 
an elevation of 2500 feet. 

Leitrim. — Mr. Thompson has found it in this county. 

Sligo. — I never saw a greater profusion or variety of this 
fern than near the town of Sligo, on approaching it from Manor- 
hamilton ; it occurs not only on the limestone rocks and walls, 
which are there very abundant, but in the hedge-rows, mingled 
with Scolopendrium vulgare. 

The range of elevation is very great, extending over 3000 feet. 

Ferns very similar to many of our British forms of this species 
occur in every country of Europe, in Northern and Southern

Africa, in Asia, North America, and many of the islands of the 
Pacific Ocean : it is true that these have been frequently de- 
scribed as distinct species, but the evidence on the subject is at 
present scarcely sufficient to induce me to admit them as such. 

There are many very beautiful and characteristic figures of 
this fern : those in Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’^ under the names of Po‘ 
lypodium rli(Blicmn and P. fragile, yield to none in excellence : 
I think his P. rhaeticum may be regarded as the normal form of 
fragilis. 

The little ferns constituting the present group were comprised 
under the name of Polypodium fragile by Linneus and our ear- 
lier authors ; Sprengel, Willdenow, Schkuhr, Wahlenberg, and 
other eminent botanists, make them Aspidiums. Bernhardi was 
the first to separate them from these unmanageably extensive 
groups, under the generic name of Cystopteris ; Roth gave them 
the name of Cyatliea, and Smith that of Cystea, the latter being 
a mere alteration from Bernhardi’s prior name, because Cystop- 
ieris is “ compounded of another established ” name, Pteris.\ 
The name has been spelled Cistopterishj several modern authors, 
an orthography whose evident deviation from the Greek appears 
to render inadmissible : in fact there is no sufficient reason for 
altering or modifying a name that possesses the acknowledged 
right to adoption on account of its priority. 

My views having in more than one instance undergone con- 
siderable modification as regards the limits of species, I turned 
my attention to the beautiful little ferns I had previously grouped 
together under the name of Cystopteris fragilis, in the hope of 
discovering some characters whereby the various forms might be 
satisfactorily distinguished from each other. Several botanists 
of eminence have undertaken somewhat too readily the establish- 
ment of new species ; dwarf size, imperfect fructification, or 
even, in more than one instance, mere accidental deformity, 
having furnished the chief diagnostic. Now, as in Zoology we 
endeavour to refer the females and young, and even individuals 
that have undergone mutilation, to the same species as the adult 
male, so would I, in ferns, rather refer specimens which appear

in any degree imperfect to some established species, expressing 
a doubt if I entertained one, than separate such imperfect spe- 
cimens under a new appellation. In every attempt I make to 
establish or ascertain a species, I find it most satisfactory to dis- 
miss entirely all such specimens, to refuse all cognizance of 
them, and to contrast the most perfect and most fruitful fronds 
only. For as in Zoology we find specific differences most satis^ 
factorily developed in adults, so shall we also find in ferns ; and 
if essential differences really exist, we shall be sure to see those 
differences more clearly when Nature has brought the objects 
under consideration to their highest state of perfection, maturity 
and beauty. Entertaining these views, I have dismissed from the 
enquiry — as regards the species of Cystopteris — not only all 
seedling, immature, barren or monstrous fronds, but also all those 
which appeared to owe their peculiarities to the varied degrees 
of drought or moisture, elevation, protection or exposure, or the 
numerous other casualties to which so hardy yet fragile a fern 
is by its nature subjected ; and to compare those only which 
grew under corresponding circumstances, had arrived at a 
corresponding state of maturity, and possessed the stem entire 
to its very junction with the rhizoma. The result of a very 
careful scrutiny may be thus summed up. First, I think it 
highly probable that many species are confounded under one 
specific name. Secondly, I am unable to give my assent to the 
species described by Sir J. E. Smith; neither his published de- 
scriptions nor the authentic specimens named by himself suffi- 
ciently exhibiting specific differences. Thirdly, I consider that 
forms exist quite as marked and as distinct from the normal or 
usual form of fragilis as any that have hitherto received names, 
either as species or varieties. And fourthly, I find myself un- 
able to lay down characters whereby any individual form may 
be clearly and distinctly ascertained. Under these circumstan- 
ces I prefer treating them still as constituent parts of a single 
species, leaving the task of separation to abler botanists than 
myself, but giving the whole of Smith’s descriptions at length, 
accompanied in every instance by the figure of a frond, carefully 
compared with the specimens from w^hich his description was 
compiled.

ASPIDIACEiE. 


I select the variety called dentata, as the most simple form, 
to begin the series. 

Cystea dentata, Smith. Polypodium dentatmn, Dickson. 

“ Rather smaller than Cystea fragilis, but 
agreeing with it in texture, colour, and ge- 
neral aspect. Root tufted, small. Frond 
for the most part correctly hipinnate, a few 
of the lower leaflets only, in luxuriant speci- 
mens, being pinnate or pinnatifid ; the leaf- 
lets are exactly ovate, or rounded, obtuse, 
pointless, copiously and bluntly serrated or 
toothed : their ribs wavy ; their base not 
decurrent, though seated on a winged mid- 
rib ; masses prominent, at length entirely 
confluent, of a uniform rich chestnut brown. 
I do not perceiv^e in the younger ones that 
peculiar blackness which is observable in 
P. fragilis. The cover is short, jagged, 
concave. I have never seen it in an early 
state before bursting.”^ Sir J. E. Smith 
has described this species, as far as regards 
the leading characters of the fronds, with 
great accuracy ; but he has made his spe- 
cies too lax by introducing into it a variety 
of specimens from Llangollen and Anglesea : 
these have nothing to do with Dickson’s 
original plant, which was found in Scotland, 
and is the only form of fragilis which I 
could find on the northern shoulders of Ben 
More, where it is most abundant, descend- 
ing even to the walls on the road-side between Killin and Tyn- 
drum. Sir J. E. Smith appears to have known nothing of the 
plant but from a dried frond : he makes no allusion to the re- 
flexed, drooping, and convex pinnae of the young fronds, or the 
more marginal arrangement of the clusters of capsules, characters 
which appear of some importance.

The second variety I consider to be the typical form of P, 
fragile^ as described by Linneus. 

Cystea fragilis. Smith. '' Fronds several together, from four to 
ten or twelve inches high, lanceolate, 
pointed, smooth, of a full though bright 
green, doubly or almost triply pinnate. 

Stalk brown or blackish, very brittle 
and juicy, occupying one- third or near- 
ly half of the length of the whole, des- 
titute of scales, except at its very base. 

The primary divisions or leaves are usu- 
ally nearly opposite, acute, of a moderate 
length ; leaflets mostly alternate, ovate, 
acute or pointed, in barren fronds some- 
times blunter ; their base always tapering 
and decurrent ; they are by no means 
linear or oblong, nor is their margin 
wavy, but copiously, deeply and sharply 
toothed, and their substance is firm ; the 
larger and lower ones are deeply pinna- 
tifid, their lobes resembling the upper 
leaflets. Masses numerous and crowd- 
ed, globular ; at first pale^ but finally 
blackish and confluent, covering the 
whole back of the frond. Cover 
white, flaccid, membranous, concave, 
irregularly jagged and torn, sometimes 
lengthened out into an oblong point, but 
soon turned back and obliterated, or 
forced off by the swelling, shining cap- 
sules, which, in an early state, are often 
quite black, though subsequently brown- 
erf"^ In this description a discrepancy 

occurs in the colour of the capsules ; the colour of the clusters, 
in an early state, is very inconstant, but generally blackish ; the 
autumnal fronds, when in cultivation, have smaller clusters than

the vernal ; the clusters also are rarely confluent ; the frond itself 
is more minutely divided. 

The third form, often found on the same plant as the preced- 
ing, is called angmtata. 

Cystea angustata. “Root tufted, or somewhat creeping, 
black, with long fibres and rusty scales. Fronds several, erect, 
twelve or fifteen inches high, of which the slender, blackish, 
smooth, and naked stalk occupies more than a 
third, sometimes nearly half ; the midrib above 
is still more slender, and, like every other part, 
quite smooth, without any membranous bor- 
der. Main wings or leaves bright green, from 
twelve to fifteen pair, of a moderate length, 
nearly opposite, taper-pointed; the lowermost 
rather shorter and more remote from the next 
than those about the middle of each frond ; 
all pinnate, with a scarcely bordered midrib. 
Leaflets about ten at each side, alternate, 
lanceolate, decurrent, rather bluntly pointed, 
sometimes tapering at the extremity; all 
either deeply pinnatifid, with oblong, acute, 
wavy segments ; or, in less luxuriant plants, 
slightly pinnatifid, or only wavy at the mar- 
gin ; the ribs of all more or less wavy. The 
ultimate divisions, in every instance, are ob- 
long or linear, never dilated, rounded, or 
ovate ; they are sometimes, though seldom, 
notched or cloven at the end. By this linear 
or oblong mode of division, and its thinner 
more pliant texture, the present species may 
readily be known from both the preceding, 
with which it has generally been confounded. 
The masses of capsules, much smaller and less 
prominent than in those species, always con- 
tinue distinct, standing either solitary or in 
pairs, towards the bottom of each lobe or tooth, and are round, 
at first pale, subsequently brown.”^ The frond to which Sir J.

E. Smith refers as having been found at Gordale, in Craven, still 
remains in his herbarium, and is figured on the preceding page. 

The fourth and last variety noticed by Smith, and one v^hich 
Professor Don considers distinct as a species, is called Cystea 
regia by Smith, who supposes it to be the Polypodium regium 
of Linneus. I have carefully examined the specimens preserved 
under this name in the Linnean herbarium ; these are three in 
number : — the first appears to be the normal form of fragilis, 
although the specimen is injured ; the second is the species 
known by our cultivators as Asplenium fontanum ; and the third 
is the Polypodium dentatum of Dickson. The grand habitat of 
this plant is a wall at Layton, near Walthamstow, in Essex. 

Cystea regia, “ Root tufted, scaly. Fronds several, from 
three to ten or twelve inches high, bright green, 
lanceolate, twice pinnate, pinnatifid, and finely 
cut, of a most elegant appearance, quite smooth 
in every part except a few membranous, tom, 
pointed, brown scales, at the very bottom of 
the stalk, which is less brittle and juicy than 
that of C, fragilis. Leaves and leaflets more 
generally alternate than opposite ; the former 
with a narrowly- winged or bordered midrib ; 
the latter ovate, obtuse, deeply pinnatifid, with 
elliptic, oblong, obtuse, partly cloven, or 
notched segments, but not elongated, linear, or 
wavy at the margin like C. august at a, neither 
are their ribs zigzag as in that species. Masses 
of capsules very copious, but small, pale, 
scattered, not crowded, nor do they appear ever 
to become confluent. In a young state each is 
wrapped up in a white membranous concave 
cover, terminating in a tapering, more or less 
jagged, point, nearly agreeing with C. fragilis, hui the masses are 
much smaller, and the capsules of a pale brown, never black.”*

Closely allied to the first of these is a small and beautiful va- 
riety found by Mr. Gibson, at Burnley, near Coin, in Lancashire ; 
the figures at page 149 faithfully represent some fronds presented 
to me by Mr. Gibson. This variety produces abundance of seed, 
the clusters of capsules becoming confluent, and occupying 
the entire under surface of the frond. It should here be ob- 
served that Roth makes no less than six species of this genus, 
five of which appear to be referrible to the plant now under 
consideration.* 

It is almost impossible to give a satisfactory description of a 
fern so variable in form. 

The roots are numerous, black, wiry ; the rhizoma is tufted. 
The fronds begin to unfold early in the spring, and appear very 
evanescent, generally arriving at maturity in a few weeks : a 
constant succession of fronds is produced throughout the sum- 
mer and autumn, but all disappear with the first frosts of winter. 
The general form of the frond is lanceolate and pinnate ; the 
pinnae are also pinnate, but beyond this they appear to possess 
no character in common. The length of the stem is very various. 
The lateral veins are alternate, and each is usually divided into 
three or four branches, one extending to every serrature in each 
lobe of the pinnule. The lower detached figure in page 155 re- 
presents a pinnule, showing the veins and points of the attach- 
ment of the capsules ; the figure immediately above it represents 
a lobe of the same pinnule ; almost every vein bears a cluster 
of capsules near its extremity ; the cluster is nearly circular, 
and has a loose, white, membranous involucre, attached on 
one side only, beneath the capsules ; its margin, at the farthest 
extremity from its attachment, is striated, and becomes split into 
capillary segments, or sometimes torn in a ragged manner, and 
at length entirely disappears : the clusters of capsules rapidly 
increase in size, frequently becoming confluent, as represented 
at page 154, where the apex of a frond with confluent clusters 
is represented to the left of the cut. In cultivation I have ob- 
served that sometimes, from the plant receiving a check from 
exposure or improper treatment, the masses remain of small size, 
and covered with the involucre, even after the frond has withered.

WILSON’S FERN.

WILSON’S FERN {natural size). 

CySTOPTERIS MONTANA, Link. 

This very elegant and interesting fern has only occurred in 
one British locality, as described below. 

Forfarshire. — Mr. Wilson has kindly handed me the follow- 
ing notice of its discovery. — “ I found this fern on Ben Lawers, 
while botanising in company with Professors Hooker and Gra- 
ham, in August, 1836. I do not think it probable it could have 
been introduced by accident, much less by design. It grows in 
a part where Saxifraga rivularis is or was occasionally found, 
but so rarely that I never saw it but once, when Sir W. J. Hooker 
pointed out a starved and scarcely intelligible plant : the scar-

city therefore of the fern is no argument against its being truly 
indigenous. I gathered all the fronds I saw, but left the root, 
and think that I could find it again. Not being acquainted with 
the species I preserved it unnamed, until I happened to see the 
Cryptogamic collection of Mongeot and Nestler, and was at once 
struck with their Aspidium monianum as being identical with 
my new fern.” I have also to acknowledge my obligation to 
Mr. Wilson for the loan of several fronds, thus affording me the 
opportunity of making an exact figure ; and also to the Botani- 
cal Society of London for the loan of a specinen presented by 
Mr. Wilson. 

The geographical range of this beautiful fern appears to be 
very extensive. It occurs in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Hun- 
gary, France, Italy and Spain. I am indebted to Mr. Ward for 
a very perfect specimen, gathered in Norway, by my late la- 
mented friend Mr. William Christy. Mr. Smith, of the Kew 
Botanic Garden, has shown me specimens from the Western 
States of North America : it is generally described as occurring 
on rough or stony ground, sometimes in woods and in suhalpine 
regions : 2700 feet is given as its elevation. 

There is an excellent figure of Cystopteris montana in 
Schkuhr,* but with this exception I do not recollect seeing a 
good representation of it. 

The specific name of this plant has undergone no change 
as far as I am aware, but as our authors have aimed at the sub- 
division of groups it has been repeatedly provided with a new 
generic appellation. Hoffman made it a P olyp odium ; Swartz, 
Schkuhr, Sadler and Decandolle an Aspidium ; Sir J. E. Smith 
(in the ‘ Turin Transactions ’) and Roth a Cyatliea, a genus sy- 
nonymous with the earlier one of Cystopteris, in which it is now 
generally placed. 

The roots and rhizoma I have never seen ; the latter is figured 
by Schkuhr as creeping : the stem is long, slender, erect, and 
has a few scattered scales, more especially near the base : the 
figure of the frond is triangular, and much resembles that of 
Polypodium Dryopteris or P. calcar eum ; it is pinnate, the first

pair of pinnae being, as in the species just named, nearly opposite, 
and very much larger than any of the others, indeed nearly equal- 
ling in size all the rest : these pinnae are pinnate, the pinnules 
also pinnate; the lobes deeply pinnatifid, and their divisions 
also notched : it is, therefore, one of the most compound of our 
ferns, in this respect equalling even the Common Brakes : the 
second pair of pinnae are nearly opposite, but the remainder 
gradually become alternate. The first inferior pinnule of the 
lower pair is very much larger and more divided than the first 
superior pinnule of the same pair ; this disproportion decreases 
gradually, until, at the apex of the pinna, its opposite pinnules 
nearly correspond in size. 

All the specimens found by Mr. Wilson were without fruit, 
^but this is an evident departure from the usual character of the 
fern, the entire under surface being commonly covered with clus- 
ters of capsules. Mr. E. Forster has very kindly lent me, for 
the present work, a Swiss specimen, which is just in that state 
of incipient fructification which best displays its characters, and 
in every respect the similarity to that of C.fragilis is very close. 
The lateral veins are alternate ; each generally ceases in a sinus 
between two serratures : the involucre is attached at the back 
of each lateral vein, and bends forward over the capsules in the 
manner of a hood ; its free anterior margin is jagged and un- 
even, and opens outwards towards the point of the serrature. 
The masses of capsules are nearly circular, and become very 
prominent when mature ; although crowded, each appears to re- 
tain its individuality, and they never seem to become perfectly 
confluent.

Observation on the genus Polystichum, — Commencing with 
those simple forms of the genus Pohjstichum which are confined 
to the summits of our most bleak and rugged mountains, I have 
traced the figure and cutting of the frond to its most divided 
state, and have raised the latter to the rank of a species, under 
the name of Polystichum angulare^ being as I suppose the As- 
pidium angulare of Willdenow, Sprengel, and Sadler. Thus, 
in the pages immediately following, I have reversed not only the 
sequence observed, but the judgment expressed, in the first edi- 
tion. The latter alteration I consider of doubtful propriety ; it 
is the result of a desire to meet the views of abler botanists than 
myself. This divided form appears to me the concomitant of 
cultivation, the denizen of our established hedge^banks, our 
shady lanes, and our sheltered homesteads.

Caernarvonshire. Mr. Pinder, who found it on Snowdon' 
and on Glyder Vawr, in both places in fruit, observes that the 
plants were more lax in their habit than those from Scotland, 
yet he found on cultivation that their character remained un- 
changed. Bolton records both these localities, and Hudson says 
it is plentiful on the mountains above Llanberis. Clogwyn-y- 
Gamedd, near the summit of Snowdon, and Cwm Idwell, have 
often been recorded as stations ; and I was successful in finding, 
in several localities near the last of these stations, the plant to 
which botanists allude : it grows just at the upper entrance of 
that vast fissure called Twll-du ; again, proceeding thence to the 
right of the fissure, one or two plants occur on the face of the 
rock near the spot where Anthericum serotinum is found, a dan- 
gerous locality by the way, requiring a firm foot and a cool head ; 
and again, below the fissure, on the rocks to the right. 

Durham. — Mr. J. Backhouse observes that it is very fine on 
Falcon Clints, just where the basalt joins the mountain lime- 
stone, ten miles west of Middleton, in Teesdale. 

Yorkshire. — Mr. Tatham, who has obligingly sent me a spe- 
cimen, observes that it occurs sparingly on the rocks above Settle. 
To Mr. S. Thompson, of York, I am indebted for a second spe- 
cimen from Attermire Scar ; these specimens, being small and 
very sparingly fruited, do not possess diagnostics whereby I can 
separate them from the seedling forms of P. aculeatum, Mr. 
Watson has published an opinion to the same effect. 

In Scotland this fern is much more abundant, and more harsh, 
prickly, rigid and erect in its character. As I have every reason 
to believe it exists in many other localities, I give the following 
list under a feeling of its great imperfection.

for beautiful specimens from the Clova mountains : Mr. Watson 
informs me he has found it on these mountains ; and Mr. Gar-

me, observes that it is plentiful among the rocks of the moun-

I The geographical range of this species beyond the limits of 
I the British empire appears not very extensive. Sadler gives it 
i as an inhabitant of Hungary, Germany, France, Italy and Swe-

j comprehensive than most of our British botanists would consent 
I to do ; and Lamarck and Decandolle give its locality as les hois

part of that figured on the present page, fig. a), 
to the species next described, yet I have 
thought it unadvisable, in the absence of 
positive information on the subject, to in- 
terfere with a nomenclature now re- 
ceived throughout Europe. The genus 
Polystichum was established by Roth 
in his ‘Flora Germanica,’ in 1800, 
and is so far synonymous with Swartz’s 
genus Aspidium, published in the same 
year, that both included a long list of 
the same species ; still the genus As- 
pidium was so vague and so extensive 
as almost to vie in these respects with 
the genus Polypodium of Linneus, 
whereas Roth very suitably separated 
Cystopteris and Athyrium, and made 
no mention whatever of the extra-Eu- 
ropean species placed by Swartz at 
the head of his genus. Still even 
Roth’s genus is unmanageably large, 
and it becomes the duty of modern 
botanists to attempt subdivision with- 
out allowing either of the names pro- 
posed by these great botanists to be 
lost to science ; and all our most able 
filicologists agree in limiting the ge-

strong, black and wiry ; 


nus Aspidium to those tropical species placed by the author as 
its types, and the genus Polysticlium to the leading species Lo7i~ 
chitis, and those cognate ferns distinguished by a similar peltate 
involucre. 

The roots of this species are long 
the rhizoma is tufted and scaly : 
the fronds appear early in the 
spring, arrive at perfection in Sep- 
tember and October, and remain in 
full vigour until the following sum- 
mer j the form of the frond is linear- 
lanceolate and pinnate. In the 
Twll du plant, which I have figured 
on the opposite page, the habit is 
lax and drooping. The pinnae are 
crowded, and extend nearly to the 
base of the stem, which is covered 
with chaffy scales ; they are some- 
what crescent-shaped, auricled on 
the upper side next the stem, ser- 
rated and acutely spined ; each 
pinna is twisted, a character least 
apparent in the Welch, and most 
so in the Irish specimens, in which 
the auricled portion of each pinna 
passes behind the pinna immedi- 
ately above it, and projects behind 
the fronds almost at right angles 
with the stem : the Scotch speci- 
mens are intermediate in this res- 
pect. In the Welch and English 
plants the colour of the frond is 
dull green,, much resembling that 
of P. aculeatum, while in the Irish, 

and some of the Scotch specimens, the upper surface is of a 
full, rich, shining green, the substance thick and leathery, and the 
whole frond as rigid and prickly as a spike of little holly leaves, 
so much so indeed that the fronds are not to be flattened for

drying without considerable difficulty. The lateral veins are 
alternate and generally three-branched, the anterior branch 
usually terminating half way between the mid-vein and margin, 
the others reaching the margin, but being quite free at their ex- 
tremity. It should, however, be observed, that the auricle or lobe 
at the base of each pinna has a formula of venation decidedly 
different from the remainder of the pinnule, since the principal 
vein in this lobe emits several fruitful branches in an opposite 
direction to that taken by the rest. The involucre is circular, 
and attaclied to the back of each anterior branch of the lateral 
veins near its extremity ; the attachment is by a short central 
cord : the capsules are attached to the vein around the base of 
the cord of the involucre, and, as they reach maturity, form a 
circular cluster, and these clusters a continuous line on each 
side of the pinna, about equidistant from its midrib and margin. 
Some specimens are so densely seeded that the masses become 
confluent. In the Irish, as in all other specimens, the clusters 
of capsules are most abundant towards the apex of the frond, 
but they are also scattered throughout the other parts, even to its 
base, whereas in the Scotch, Welch, and particularly the English 
specimens, the masses are confined to the upper part of the 
frond. Mr. Tatham, in allusion to these observations, remarks 
that in the Settle plant “ the seed is generally confined to about 
a third of the frond, but I have some that are half covered.” 

The fronds represented at page 163 are from Scotland; those 
at page 166 from Wales : figure h shows the venation, and the 
points whence the clusters of capsules have been removed ; 
figure c represents a pinna with the fructification in a very young 
state, the peltate involucre alone being visible ; figure d another 
pinna, in which the clusters of capsules have swollen, and more 
or less concealed the involucre : the figures at page 167 are

PRICKLY FERN [one-Jifteenth the natural size), 
PoLYSTiCHUM ACULEA.TUM, Roth, Babington. 

Aspidium aculeatum and lohatum^ Smith, Hooker. 

In one or other of its forms this protean fern seems to be dis- 
tributed throughout the kingdom. I have seen it more or less 
abundantly in every county I have visited, whether in England, 
Wales, Scotland or Ireland ; in the last-named country, how- 
ever, it is less common than in either of the others, the fern 
next described appearing to take its place. It seems to delight 
in the protection of man, its favorite locality being our hedge- 
rows, and its luxuriance being greatly increased by cultivation, 
or even by proximity to cultivated lands : its occurrence on our 
moors, commons, and mountains, is comparatively rare, its sta- 
ture diminutive, and its fronds are rigid and sparingly divided. 

Its European range extends to every country except Spain, 
w^here one would rather suppose it unobserved than absent, since 
it occurs commonly throughout France, especially in the south,

and ascends the Pyrenees to the height of 2500 feet. It is found j 
in Asia, Northern and Southern Africa, and North America : in | 
the latter country it is extremely rare, but perfectly identical j 
with our British plant. 

I pass over the figures of this species, since a reference to 1 
them is rather likely to mislead under our present doubts with 
regard to the limits of the species. 

There can be no doubt that our plant is the Folypodimn acu~ 
leatum of Linneus, and the Polypodium lohatum of Hudson, ^ 
notwithstanding that Sir J. E. Smith separates these two by the 
introduction of Aspidium angulare of Willdenow between them ; ; 

he also cites Ray, apparently in defence of his third species, i 
but I am inclined to think that both Hudson and Ray intended i 
to describe the two species now given as distinct, Ray’s ‘ Filix \ 
mas non ramosa pinnulis latis auriculatis spinosis ’ being ! 
Hudson’s Polypodium aculeatum;\ and his ^ Filix aculeata I 
major pinnulis auriculatis crehrioribus foliis integris an- I 
gustiorihus'* X being Hudson’s lohatum.^ Ray’s I 

description of the latter species is excellent, and the admirable | 
comparison between the two clearly shows the plants intended, I 
although the description of the first, it must be confessed, is | 
somewhat meagre. | 

The roots are unusually long, strong and tough, often taking I 
so firm a hold of the soil — especially when the plant is growing f 
in hedge-banks, among the roots of whitethorn or hazel — as to 
require great labour in removing. The rhizoma is very large, i 
apparently increasing slowly with age, and enduring for very | 
many years. I observe that large plants which I removed in ; 
1837 have remained almost stationary in size, and exhibit no I 
symptoms of incipient decay. The young fronds make their E 
appearance in April, the circinate apex being bent backwards, ^ 
and remarkably graceful in its appearance : the pinnae of the k 
young frond are also circinate : I have attempted, in the vignette [J 
at page 172, to give an idea of this character. The fronds attain _ j 
their full expansion in July, and the seed appears to have reached fl

maturity in September : the fronds are tough, leathery, and 
perfectly persistent, retaining their green uninjured by frosts 
throughout the year, and showing no disposition to decay until 
the fronds of the succeeding year are fully developed ; indeed 
they are of so rigid and durable a character, that after changing 
their green hue for one of brown, they remain almost unaltered 
in form, and thus Nature often preserves the foliage of three or 
four successive years, attached to the same rhizoma, displaying 
to the enquiring gaze of the botanist a variation in character 
which will often strike him with astonishment. The form of the 
frond may be termed lanceolate, but it becomes more or less 
linear and more or less attenuated towards the base. The stem 
is usually very short, and is densely clothed with reddish scales ; 
these are very large, and crowded at its junction with the rhi- 
zoma, but upwards they diminish in size, and are much smaller 
where the stem becomes mingled with the frond. The rhizoma 
has always a disposition to fix itself on a perpendicular surface, 
whence the fronds issue in a nearly horizontal direction, their 
rigid habit almost precluding the possibility of their assuming 
that graceful bend which is more or less observable in every 
other fern similarly situated. The frond is lanceolate and pin- 
nate : the pinnae are variously divided : when entire, as is usually 
the case when the plant is young (figs, a a a), the fronds resem- 
ble those of the preceding species, P. Lonchitis, from which 
circumstance the name of Lonchitidoides has been applied to 
this form. When the first upper pinnule is separated from the 
body of the pinna, which remains nearly entire (figs, h h), the plant 
becomes the Aspidium munitum of the continent ; at least such 
is the opinion I gather from the descriptions of Sadler and 
others : when the pinna is more divided (figs, c c c),l suppose it 
to be the Polypodium lohatum of Hudson : and lastly, when the 
pinnule becomes quite pinnate at the base, and even beyond the 
middle (fig. d)^ it is the P. aculeatum of Linneus. I believe 
that no one who has watched the plant with careful attention has 
ever supposed these forms to be more than varieties of a single 
species. The first upper pinnule on each pinna is much larger 
than either of the others, indeed it is usually twice as large as 
the first lower pinnule ; it points directly upwards towards the 


172 


ASPIDIACE^. 


apex of the frond, but owing to a certain convexity, which 
every division of the frond in some degree possesses, its point 
is bent downwards, and very frequently passes below and beyond 
the midrib of the preceding pinna ; the double series of these en- 
larged pinnules, often amounting to more than twenty, has a very 
striking appearance : all the pinnules have a sharp spine at their 
extremity, and several lesser spines at their edges, and each of 
the enlarged superior pinnules is slightly auricled at its outer 
margin near the base, and the auricle has a very strong and 
distinct spine towards the base of the frond ; this character ex- 
tends to several of the other pinnules which most nearly approach 
the stem, and these are generally placed on short foot-stalks, 
whereas all the others are decurrent or united at the base ; the di- 
rection which they assume, observable particularly in the inferior 
pinnules of each pinna, forms an acute angle with the midrib 
of the pinna. The seed is confined to the upper portion of the 
frond ; and in its circular involucre attached by a central cord ; 
in its circular clusters of capsules occasionally confluent, but 
generally separate ; and in the distribution of the veins, T find no 
characters distinct from those which I have afready figured as 
characteristic of the preceding species.

t WILLDENOW’S FERN [one-twentieth the natural size). 

PoLYSTiCHUM ANGULARE, Newman. 

Aspidium angulare^ Smith, Hooker. 

This fern, like the preceding, is almost universally distribut- 
ed : it is, however, confined much more exclusively to lowland 
regions, warm sheltered woods and hedge-rows, and seldom as- 
cends to any considerable altitude. In some parts of Ireland it 
is exeeedingly abundant, and seems to take the place of P. acu- 
leatum, which I consider the commoner fern in most parts of 
England. 

Without the means of comparing specimens, I presume, from 
the description which I have quoted below,* that the plant now 
under consideration is the Aspidium angulare of Willdenow. 

The roots and rhizoma present no characters by which I can 
distinguish them from those of the preceding. The stem is dis- 
tinct, about one fourth as long as the frond, and densely clothed

with large reddish scales. The plant appears to prefer a hori- 
zontal to a vertical surface ; its habit is weak, flexible, graceful 
and drooping ; a number of fronds issue from the crown of the 
rhizoma, and, when uninterrupted, spread from a common cen- 
tre, presenting a very beautiful appearance : the texture of the 
frond is soft and delicate, its form lanceolate and pinnate : the 
pinnae are very numerous, elongate, linear, distinct, often dis- 
tant, drooping and pinnate ; the pinnules are blunt at the apex, 
auricled at the base, distinctly stalked and serrated at the edges, 
and each serrature is armed with a spine : every part of the 
under surface of the fronds, more especially the primary and 
secondary stems, abounds in reddish chaffy scales. 

When we select a specimen of this plant in its extreme state, 
and contrast it with a specimen of P. aculeaUim, also in its ex- 
treme state, — when we select a central pinnule of each, and lay 



them before us side by side, on a sheet of paper, the difference 
is so striking, that were our observations allowed no wider range, 
we must exercise much sophistry in inducing even ourselves to 
suppose them identical. The distinctly stalked pinnules of an- 
gulare (fig. a), set on the stem at a more obtuse angle than that 
of the decurrent pinnules of aculeatum (fig. h), offer instantly a 
character which it is impossible to resist: and this, added to the 
discrepancy in the habit, texture and figure of the frond, must 
lead the botanist to pronounce them perfectly distinct. It is.

howevei’, from the constant occurrence of plants intermediate in 
habit, texture, figure and cutting, that the difficulty has arisen. 
Sir J. E. Smith has thought to solve this difficulty, by consider- 
ing those forms which belong to neither species as constituting 
a species distinct from either. I proceed to give his descriptions. 

Aspidium aculeatum, Root tufted, large. Fronds numer- 
ous, spreading in a circle, each rather smaller than those of A. 
Filix-mas, of a dark blueish green, paler beneath, lanceolate, 
tapering to a point, firm and somewhat rigid, elegantly, regular- 
ly, and closely twice pinnate, with a considerable very scaly 
stalk ; the midrib, and partial ribs also, being clothed with nar- 
rower scales, sometimes occurring still narrower, like hairs, on 
the backs of the leaflets. Leaves alternate, close together, li- 
near-lanceolate, taper-pointed. Leaflets numerous, alternate, 
distinctly though rather shortly stalked, ovate inclining to lunate, 
with an oblique, acute, tapering point ; the serratures few and 
unequal, likewise taper-pointed, the lowermost of which, at the 
upper edge, forms more or less of a lobe, especially in the low- 
est leaflet, which is rather bigger than the rest. Masses smaller 
and more remote than in the two last [A, Filix-mas and crista- 
Cover orbicular, without a notch, flat, with a central 
protuberance when young.”^ 

Aspidium angulare. “ Softer and more delicate in texture, as 
well as more shaggy, than the last. The leaflets are smaller, 
more numerous, blunter, and rounded at the extremity, though 
tipped with a soft bristly point, and each of them, even to the 
smallest, has a broad conspicuous lobe, at the base of the upper 
margin ; the lowest of all, at the upper edge of each main leaf, 
is half as long again as its next neighbour, more strongly serra- 
ted, and in its lower part generally pinnatifid. All the lobes and 
serratures end in soft bristly points. Stalk, and principal rib, 
densely covered with scales, which are narrower in proportion as 
they are higher up, those on the partial ribs or on the leaflets 
occasionally, being almost capillary. Masses numerous and 
crowded. Cover orbicular, for the most part entire, with a cen- 
tral depression. The outline of the whole frond is rather broader

than A, aculeatum, and the more copious, distinct, rounded, 
auricled leaflets give the whole a rich and elegant aspect.”* 

Aspidium lohatum, This is most akin to A. aculeatum^ n, 
6, but Ray, in his excellent ‘ Synopsis,’ has well marked their 
differences. The fronds of the present species, though nearly 
as long as in that, are narrower, the leaves, or pinnae, being 
shorter, and they are shorter still than in A. angulare. They are 
also more crowded, especially at the base, where the foremost 
leaflet of each lowermost pair lies close to the main rib, and is 
so much larger than any of the other leaflets, as to leave no va- 
cancy along the middle part of the frond, sometimes overlaying 
the rib itself. The leaflets in general are rather larger than in 
either of the foregoing, more pointed, and of a firmer texture, as 
well as of a lighter or paler green, more polished, and less hairy, 
the main rib only being scaly, the partial ones but slightly so 
towards the base. The decurrent character of the leaflets was 
first pointed out to me by Mr. D. Turner.”f 

Sir W. J. Hooker retains all these species, but adds a doubt 
as to their distinctness. His descriptions are as follow. 

A. lohatum. “ Fronds oblong-lanceolate bipinnate, pinnules 
rigid convex ovate sub-lunate acuminate aristate oblique and 
cuneated at the base and decurrent, the margins faintly serrated 
spinulose, with a distinct tooth at the base on the upper side, 
the one next the main rachis longer than the rest, stipes and ra- 
chis more or less chaffy, fructifications confined to the upper 
half of the fronds.”J 

A. aculeaUim. ‘‘ Fronds broadly lanceolate bipinnate, pin- 
nules subrigid somewhat convex slightly petioled ovato-sublu- 
nate acuminate or acute aristate obliquely truncate and auricled 
at the base on the upper side, the one next the main rachis some- 
what larger than the rest, the margins distinctly serrated and 
spinulose, stipes and rachis chaffy, fructifications copious.”§ 

A. angulare. “ Fronds broadly lanceolate bipinnate, pinnules 
thin and membranaceous plane petioled ovate sublunate obtuse 
aristate obliquely truncate at the base with a large auricle on the 
upper side, the margins deeply serrated spinulose, the lowermost

ones often deeply pinnatifid, that next the main rachis scarcely 
larger than the rest (excepting in var. i3.), stipes and rachis very 
chaffy, fructifications copious. ^ ^ Of this plant I 

possess specimens from Mr. Wigham, of Norwich, who was so 
much in the habit of consulting Sir J. E. Smith, when any diffi- 
culty occurred in the naming of a species, that I have every rea- 
son to believe the present to be the plant so called in E. Flora. 
It is, too, what is generally considered A. aculeatum by British 
botanists, and has hence only been placed in opposition to A. 
lobatum Sm., from which, at first sight, and in essential charac- 
ter, it certainly appears distinct ; but after a most careful exa- 
mination of numerous specimens I am compelled to say that 
there is a third kind, the A, aculeatum of E. Fh, which does par- 
take of the characters of the other two, and which some refer to 
A. lobatum^ and others as confidently to A. aculeatum. Hence, 
as it appears to me, they must all be united, or, as Smith has 
done, they must constitute three species. In Scotland the A. 
lobatum is very common, but I am not aware that the present 
species or variety is ever found there.”^' 

Mr. Babin gton considers the three forms as referrible to a sin- 
gle species, Polystichum aculeatum^ yet gives to each form the 
rank of a variety. His description is copied below. 

Polystichum aculeatum. Fronds bipinnate lanceolate, pin- 
nae linear-lanceolate, pinnules stalked or decurrent ovate acute- 
I ly-serrate. — Newm. 37. — A very variable species. — a. aculeatum ; 

I fronds broadly lanceolate, pinnules ovate acute nearly all stalked 
I their base auricled on the upper edge oblique on the lower, lobe 
I next the main rachis longer. In this plant only a few of the 
I uppermost pinnules of each pinna are confluent, most of the 
pinnules have a small auricle on the upper or outer side of their 
base, and the pinnule next the main rachis is nearly always con 
|| siderably longer than the others. Aspidium aculeatum Sm. —

ent, the auricle is larger in proportion to the pinnule and the 
lowest pinnule is often scarcely at all longer than the others. A. 
angulare Sm. — y. lohatum ; fronds narrowly lanceolate, pinnules 
decurrent often confluent, pinnule next the main rachis longer 
and larger than the others. Whole frond more rigid than in the 
other two varieties. Pinnules usually quite without auricles, not 
stalked but decurrent. Young plants often produce simply pin- 
nate rather weak and flexible fronds, with stalked ovate or ob- 
long simple pinnae having their base strongly auricled on the 
upper edge and oblique on the lower, thus approaching the fol- 
lowing species ; it is then the A. lohatum lonchitidoide^ of 
Hooker. — These three plants are so intimately connected by in- 
termediate forms that I cannot consider them to constitute more 
than one species.”'^ 

From a somewhat voluminous correspondence with British 
botanists, on the subject of these plants, I find there is a very 
general desire to maintain two species as distinct, but to omit 
the third or intermediate species. The characters recommended 
by my con*espondents are very various, and would divide a se- 
ries in a variety of ways, hence I feel reluctant to publish them. 
I must not, however, pass over in silence a very ingenious paper 
on this subject, which was read before the Botanical Society of 
London, on the 5th of November, 1841, and published in ^ The 
Phytologist’ on the 1st of December following. The author 
observes that owing to the difference of opinion entertained re- 
specting these ferns by botanists of celebrity — some considering 
them two distinct species, and others that they are merely vari- 
eties of one — any facts tending to bring to light their real cha- 
racter must be interesting ; and therefore he has much gratifi- 
cation in making known a peculiarity of structure exhibited by 
each, whereby he considers all doubt as to their being distinct 
species will be removed, 

‘‘ The two ferns, in their typical form, differ very materially 
from each other ; and their differences have been well described 
by those who have written on the subject. But almost all, if not 
the whole of the characters which have been set down as dis-

tinctive, are liable to be so extremely modified by different de- 
grees of altitude, moisture, light, exposure &c. of situation, that 
an unpractised eye would often be quite unable to determine 
the species of these closely-allied plants, whence, questionless, 
has arisen the doubt as to their separate specific individuality. 
Thus, Polystichum lohatum, upon an elevated situation, pos- 
sesses a lanceolate frond, generally very close and compact ; its 
pinnae overlapping each other : occasionally, however, these are 
distant from each other to almost the extent of their width, and 
the pinnulse are more separated, so that the plant much resem- 
bles P. aculeatum. But P. lohatum, when growing in a low 
situation, is still more like P. aculeatum ; its fronds, instead of 
being lanceolate, inclining more to ovate ; its pinnulae also are 
not merely serrated, but become slightly pinnatifid ; indeed the 
plant can with difficulty be identified. These facts, and several 
others which might be adduced, show the slight value, in this 
genus, of characters derived from the outline of the frond or of 
the pinnae and pinnulae, which are all so liable to vary in this 
particular : it was, therefore, very desirable to endeavour to find 
some more constant character, by which these kindred species, 
if they proved species, might be distinguished one from the 
other ; and after many hours spent in diligent examination of a 
great number of fronds, the author discovered a difference of ve- 
nation in the two species, which he thus describes. 

“ ‘ In examining the fronds of P. aculeatum, it may be no- 
ticed that the veins which bear thecae are not continued, like the 
j rest of the vei^s, to the edge of the pinnulae, but each terminates 
I either at its mass of thecae, or at a very little distance beyond it. 
j The same thing is not observable in P. lobatum (when mature), 
for the corresponding veins in this are each continued through 
its mass of thecae to the very edge of the pinnule, and even in 
|| the fronds of immature plants of this species, when there is but 
I little fructification, the same character is perceptible in the pin- 
nulae nearest the base of the pinnae and of the frond — - the parts 
which in ferns exhibit most strikingly all the characters of ma- 
turity : in a few of the terminal pinnulae some of these veins do 
not reach the edge. It must not be concealed that in P. acule- 
atum, in an extremely few instances (being just what might be 

n2

expected) is a slight indication discoverable of a iheciferous vein 
being continued to the edge of the pinnule ; but in this the ap- 
pearance is very different to the decided character observable in 
P. lobatwm^ ” ^ 

Mr. Thwaites has most obligingly sent me his series of spe- 
cimens illustrating the observations above recorded : they are 
accompanied by the following note. 

I have just been re-examining the specimens upon which I 
satisfied myself of the validity of the characters 1 gave as dis- 
tinguishing the two kinds, and have looked over some other 
specimens received from correspondents ; and I remain as con- 
vinced as ever that the said characters are sufficient to discrimi- 
nate the two, notwithstanding exceptions occur more frequently 
than I at first observed, — some of the pinnules of P. aculeatum^ 
in which the sori are distant from the margin, resembling those 
of lobatum^ and some of the smaller pinnules of P. lohatum hav- 
ing the characters of aculeatum: but these appear to me as un- 
common exceptions, and not materially to diminish the value of 
the character I pointed out.” 

As regards this character, it will perhaps be sufficient for me 
to say, that I have most thoroughly examined it without feeling 
convinced of its value. I beg to refer my readers to fig. h, at 
page 167, as an illustration of the abbreviated vein to which Mr. 
Thwaites alludes ; this figure was drawn from a pinna of the 
Snowdon plant, and was published nearly two years anterior to 
Mr. Thwaites’ observations. Now the Snowdon plant is the true 
Lonchitis, according to all the evidence offered by the works 
and herbaria of Linneus and Sir J. E. Smith ; and this form of 
Lonchitis certainly has the abbreviated vein. Thus it would 
appear that Lonchitis corresponds in this character with the 
more divided form of angulare^ while it equally recedes from its 
more immediate congener known as lohatum^ a fact rather op- 
posed to the reception of this character as a safe diagnostic. 
But even laying aside this seeming objection, and admitting the 
value of the character as far as the extreme forms are concerned, 
it will be seen, that even according to Mr. Thwaites’ own ac-

knowledgment, it is not available for the exceptions, the inter- 
mediate forms, and these alone present the difficulty in distin- 
guishing the species from each other. 

I cannot conclude this subject without alluding to an ingeni- 
ous hypothesis, suggested by a very clever botanist, Mr. Jenner, 
of Lewes ; who supposes that there are two distinct species, and 
that the intermediate states are hybrids, and, on this account, 
partake of the characters of both. To this suggestion I would 
venture to reply, that we are at present without sufficient evi- 
dence of even the possibility of hybridization among Cryptoga- 
mic or non-polleniferous plants, and we cannot prudently invent 
an hypothesis to explain a phenomenon. 

Of this species, or variety, whichever may be the correct title, 
there are two most beautiful and remarkable forms; indeed, 
these are so distinct, and the intermediate states so rare, that 
they might claim a rank at least equal to that of the fern under 
which I have placed them, were it not that their rare occurrence, 
and the proximity of abundance of the usual form of angulare, 
induces the conclusion that the variations are merely accidental. 
The first of these has the stem nearly of equal length with the 
frond, and very sparingly clothed with scales : the figure of the 
frond is elongate -triangular, the lower pair of pinnae being the 
longest. The entire frond is nearly without scales. The texture 
of the frond is leathery, but in habit, as well as in the form of the 
pinnules, it agrees very closely with the normal form of angulare. 
I found two or three roots in Herefordshire, and Mr. Jenner 
has presented me with a frond gathered in Sussex. The second 
variety is still more remarkable. A specimen, for which I am 
indebted to the kindness of Mr. Pamplin, has above twenty pairs 
of pinnae, of equal length : these are gracefully curved and pen- 
dulous at the extremities, the pinnules very slender and rather 
distant, and the auricled portion at the base of each is complete- 
ly divided to the midrib : both the pinnule, and the lobe or au- 
ricle, terminate in a very acute point : the whole is densely 
chaffy. I believe this plant is now only known in cultivation. 
My specimen was cultivated by Mr. Choules, formerly gardener 
to Lady Guildford ; it is also preserved in the Royal Botanic 
Garden, at Kew.

This fern must be considered local, but its distribution is very 
general : it occurs only on those boggy heaths where the soil is 
so moist and soft that its rhizoma can extend itself with rapi- 
dity and freedom : it is found in great abundance in such situ- 
ations. The list of localities which I have received through the

MARSH FERN. 


185 


In Scotland it does not seem of common occurrence : some 
of the few localities which have reached me have turned out on 
investigation to have originated in mistake, a small form of Las- 
trcaa Oreopteris having been taken for the present plant. Through 
the kindness of Scotch botanists I have received very careful 
lists of the ferns of Argyleshire, Dumbartonshire, Dumfriesshire, 
Kirkcudbrightshire, Lanarkshire, and Renfrewshire, and from all 
of these it is absent. I am indebted to Mr. Watson for the in- 
formation of its occurrence in Forfarshire, on the authority of 
Mr. R. Maughan ; Mr. Watson adds “ not in fruit, but I believe 
the name correct.” 

In Ireland it seems equally uncommon : through the kindness 
of Mr. W. Thompson I have received the following extract from 
the MSS. of the late Mr. Templeton, respecting this fern — plen- 
tiful among woods and bushes in the low part of Portmore park, 
on the side of Lough Neath, county Antrim.” Mr. Moore in- 
forms me he has subsequently found it on the same spot. Near 
Lough Carra, county Mayo. — Mr. J. Ball. Marsh near 
Mucruss. — ’Mr. Mackay. Captain Jones informs me he subse- 

quently found it at this station, but several botanists have lately 
sought diligently without success. 

This species occurs in every country in Europe. In Asia, 
Africa, and South America, it is said to have been found, and I 
am indebted to Mr. Boott for both fronds and living plants from 
the United States, which are so similar to our British plant that 
I am unable to detect any character by which to distinguish them. 

It is rather a remarkable fact in connexion with the history 
of this fern that it has never been represented in ^ English Bo- 
tany,’ the figure which bears its name^ being, as already stated, 
evidently drawn from a specimen of Polypodium Phegopteris. 
Bolton made a somewhat similar mistake, by figuring Lastrcea 
Oreopteris in its stead,f but this he subsequently rectified by 
repeating the species under its proper name ;X his second figure 
is a very good one. 

Botanists seem scarcely agreed as to the genus to which this 
fern should be referred. Presl places it in Bory’s genus Las-

tr(Ba ; Schott constitutes a genus [Thelypteris) purposely to re- 
ceive it, and gives to the species the name of palustris ; and Sir 
W. J. Hooker, in the fifth edition of his ‘ British Flora,’ makes 
it an Aspidium : thus we have three of the highest, as well as 
most recent authorities, completely at issue on the question. 

The roots are black and fibrous ; the rhizoma slender, black, 
and rapidly creeping. The fronds are of two kinds, barren and 
fertile ; the barren appear in May, the fertile in July : the pin- 
nules of the young frond stand out at right angles with the stem. 
The stalk of the barren frond is long, smooth and erect ; the 
frond lanceolate and pinnate ; the lowermost pinnae are rather 
shorter than the second, third or fourth pairs, still not materially 
shorter, and always situate a long distance from the base of the 
stem : the pinnae are generally nearly opposite, distant, linear, 
slightly drooping and pinnatifid ; the pinnules crowded, entire 
and rounded at the extremity ; the habit is slender, delicate, and 
very fragile ; the texture thin and almost membranaceous ; the 
colour pale green. The fertile frond differs in being much more 
tall and robust and in having the margins of the pinnules con- 
volute, and the pinnules themselves are thus rendered narrower 
and apparently more distant. 

The lateral veins of the pinnules are al- 
ternate ; they are forked almost immediately 
on leaving the mid-vein, and each branch 
proceeds to the margin of the pinnule (as 
shewn at page 183), bearing a nearly circular 
cluster of capsules about midway between 
the mid-vein and margin : at the back of 
each cluster, in an early stage of the frond, 
may be seen a small, flat, whitish, reniform 
involucre, as represented in the figure in the 
margin ; this soon withers, is pushed aside 
by the swelling capsules, and is lost : the 
clusters of capsules become confluent, and 
the semi-bleached semi-membranous margin of the pinnule 
partially covers them.

This fern, as its name implies, is an inhabitant of mountains, 
and is more rarely found on low ground, and very seldom in 
highly cultivated districts. It is particularly abundant in the 
Highlands of Scotland, being in many of the mountain wilds 
more common than Pteris aquilina : it also abounds in the hill 
districts of the north of England and Wales. It is not, how- 
ever, confined to hills, since we find it sparingly in all our coun- 
ties where there is waste ground : it approaches London on all 
sides, occurring on Wimbledon common, Hampstead heath. 
High Beech, and Blackheath. Notwithstanding its apparent 
partiality for exposed and elevated districts, it grows more beau- 
tifully and luxuriantly in woods, especially where intersected by 
a little stream, on the banks of which it will often be observed 
in profusion. In Ireland it is very sparingly distributed : I only 
observed it in abundance in two spots, near Milroy bay in the 
county Donegal, and near Glendalough in the county Wicklow. 
It occurs sparingly in the Killarney district, and Mr. Moore has 
observed it in the county Derry. 

Lastrdda Oreopteris grows throughout Europe, but, according 
to Sadler, is confined to this continent, and I have seen it from 
no other part of the world : in one or two instances it has been 
confounded, though very injudiciously, with the Lastrcea Nova- 
horacensis of the United States, a perfectly distinct species. 

The figures of this fern are generally good : that in Bolton, 
to which I have already alluded as bearing the name of the pre- 
ceding species, is excellent. 

This fern has received four specific names, besides that of 
Thelypteris erroneously assigned to it : it is the Polypodium 
montanum and subsequently the Polystichum montanum of 
Roth,^ the Polypodium Oreopteris of Ehrhart and Dickson, f the 
Polypodium fragrans of the second, but not of the first, edition 
of Hudson’s ‘ Flora Anglica,’ J and the Aspidium odoriferum of

Sami. Fredk. Gray’s ‘Natural Arrangement of British Plants : 
there is a question of priority between two of these names, 
montanum and Oreopteris, which appears to issue in favour of 
the former ; this however has been rejected as clashing with 
Cystopteris montana (of the present work), formerly known as 
Polypodium montanum of Allioni : f the name of fragrans 
is objectionable, since I have good reason for believing it is 
not the first-described Polypodium fragrans of Linneus, and 
the name odoriferum is of much later date. In many of its 
characters this fern is so like the last that it is constantly taken 
for it, a circumstance which has led to a profusion of errors 
respecting localities. Schott places it in his genus Thelypteris,% 
Presl in LastrcBa,^ and Hooker in AspidAum.^ Its nearest ally 
among British Ferns appears to me to be Polypodium Phegop- 
teris, and its connexion with the species of Aspidium, Polysti- 
chum or Lastr<Ba, is by no means evident. 

The roots of this fern are numerous, strong, tough and pene- 
trating ; they appear to spread in every direction from a large, 
scaly, tufted rhizoma, which yearly increases in magnitude. In 
favorable situations this sends forth thirty or forty fronds, which 
spread with but little regularity round a common centre : imme- 
diately these begin to unroll they exhibit the pinnae, placed at 
right angles with the main stalk, and are not convolute as in the 
allied ferns, a character worthy of particular notice, because 
unusual among our ferns. The fronds, when fully expanded, 
are very variable in size, dependant chiefly on situation, but also 
in great measure on the age of the plant. An extraordinary 
number of seedlings are met with where this fern is abundant : 
these for two or three years bear little or no fruit, but after the 
third year fructification appears in abundance, and from that 
period all the fronds are fertile. Pay thought the seedling a 
distinct species Smith appears to dissent from this, but gives 
it as a variety.* ** ^ In the figure of the frond there is little or no

variation ; it is elongate, lance-shaped, regularly pinnate ; pin- 
nae acute at the apex, and gradually diminishing from about two- 
thirds of its length to the very base, the lower pinnae being 
remarkably short and nearly triangular in their form : this at- 
tenuation of the frond towards the base is an excellent diag- 
nostic (see the left hand figure, page 187), and is alone sufficient 
to distinguish the present from any other British fern. There 
is but a very small portion of stem below the pinnae, and this is 
nearly hidden by pale brown scales. The pinnae are linear and 
acute at the apex, rather distant, deeply pinnatifid, and attached 
to the main stem only by their midrib. A separate pinna is re- 
presented of the natural size at page 187. The pinnules are 
rounded and slightly crenate ; over the entire under surface are 
scattered small, yellowish, glandular globules, which are adhesive 
to the touch, and emit a powerful but not very agreeable odour : 
it is probably in consequence of this property that the species 
has been so commonly supposed to be the Polypodium fragrans 
of Linneus. 

The veins in the pinnules of Oreopteris are alternate, and are 
either simple or branched ; in the latter case both veins are 
fruitful, as in L. Thelypteris : sometimes the veins or branches 
are again divided just before their termination, and then each of 
the subdivisions is usually fruitful ; all the veins and branches 
cease just before the margin of the pinnule : 
the clusters of capsules are circular, and are 
placed very near the extremity of each vein, 
so as to form a nearly marginal series. In 
some instances, but by no means generally, 
a small, torn, white involucre is to be seen 
near the centre of each cluster of capsules, 
as represented in the margin. This involucre 
is said to be reniform, a character I have 
never been able to detect : in general the 
masses are perfectly naked, even before the frond has unrolled, 
and the plant presents every appearance of being a true Poly- 
podium.

This beautiful and very distinct species was added to our 
British Flora in 1815, by the Rev. W. T. Bree. It seems en- 
tirely confined to limestone rocks in mountainous districts, and 
has hitherto, as far as regards Great Britain, only been found in 
three English counties. 

Lancashire. — It was found by the Rev. J. Smythes, near 
the top lock of the Lancaster and Kendal canal.^ 

Westmoreland. — Mr. Simpson informs me he found it ^Gn 
great profusion growing out of broken limestone, on the declivity 
of a hill just by the border of Lancashire : ” he observes, “ I 
never saw any fern in such masses, several hundred fronds being 
together in a compact bundle, so much so indeed that when 
I had pulled two hundred no diminution of the quantity was 
observable.” Miss Beever, in a letter of a subsequent date, 
says it grows ‘‘ most profusely on and near Arnside Knot.” Mr. 
Finder, at a still later period, writes thus : I met with Lastrcea 

rigida in great profusion along the whole of the great scar 
limestone district, at intervals between Arnside Knot, where it 
is comparatively scarce, and Ingleborough, being most abundant 
on Hutton Roof crags and Farlton Knot, where it grows in the 
deep fissures of the natural platform, and occasionally high in 
the cleft of the rocks ; it is generally much shattered by the 
winds, or cropped by the sheep, which seem to be fond of it. 
With regard to the shape of the frond, I may mention that 
among some hundreds of specimens I found but one or two 
which agreed with your figure [see the right hand figure, p. 191] 
drawn from an Ingleborough specimen, all mine being more or 
less triangular [see the left hand figure], and not having the 
lower pair of pinnae shorter than those in the upper and middle 
part of the frond : the fronds of young plants are remarkably 
triangular. The two forms of frond no doubt depend upon the 
situation, whether sheltered or otherwise, and on other causes.

still I imagine the triangular to be the true form of the plant, 
having been informed by a person resident in the neighbourhood 
that the plant from Ingleborough assumes the triangular form 
in cultivation. I do not know whether it has been recorded 
that this fern possesses a slight scent, not at all unpleasant, but 
strikingly different from that of other ferns.” 

Yorkshire. — The Rev. Mr. Bree first found this fern on In- 
gleborough, near the foot of the mountain : it has since been 
found in the same locality by Mr. Finder. Mr. Tatham informs 
me “ it grows abundantly in the fissures of limestone rocks, at 
an elevation of 1550 feet above the level of the sea, and 1050 
feet above the town of Settle : in company with it are found As- 
plenium viride and Polystichum Lonchitis, the latter sparingly.” 

I have to acknowledge my obligation to all the botanists men- 
tioned for specimens from the various localities, with the excep- 
tion of that in Lancashire. 

Sadler gives this species as an inhabitant of Hungary, Ger- 
many, France and Italy, but he excludes it from Britain, Scan- 
dinavia and Spain. It occurs in Siberia, but I am not aware of 
its having been found in Africa or America. 

There are but few figures of this fern : that in Schkuhr is 
admirable; those in ‘ English Botany’^ and in Mr. Francis’s 
work t are not to be spoken of in terms of praise. 

With regard to the name of this fern I have long suspected 
we are in error. I am quite inclined to believe it identical with 
that originally described as Polypodium fragrans by Linneus. 
The first description by Linneus answers well for the present 
plant ; — “ Fronds sub-bipinnate lanceolate, pinnules crowded, 
their lobes obtuse, serrated, stalk scaly : and he adds, as if to 

enforce the character of the serrated lobes, ‘‘ It has the habit of 
Filix-mas but is much less, the pinnules are more thickly 
crowded, their lateral lobes obtuse and more deeply serrated.”§ 
Linneus also quotes Amman’s Dryopieris rubum idceum spirans,

which is an excellent description of this species ; and the Lin- 
nean authentic specimen, although very small and in a wretched 
state, has no character that contravenes such a conclusion, while 
the remarkable involucres (some of which are still in good pre- 
servation, and closely agree with that figured at page 191), and 
the toothed but not spined divisions of the pinnules, are rather 
in favour of its being a dwarf individual of that species. Hudson, 
in his first edition, quotes the description by Linneus in the ‘ Spe- 
cies Plantarum,’ and gives as its only habitat “the moist fissures 
of rocks near Keswick, in the county of Westmoreland.”* Thus 
far all the evidence appears in favor of the supposition that the 
Polypodiwn fragrans of both authors was the Lastrma rigida of 
the present work ; and it may be remarked, in allusion to the 
small size which is insisted on by Linneus and by Amman, and 
is observable also in the Ifinnean specimen, that the average 
height of this fern on the continent is nine or twelve inches, and 
that Sadler gives its height in Hungary at half a foot to a foot. 
We must now place the subject in another light. In his ‘Man- 
tissa,’ a work of the highest authority, we find Linneus giving 
a second description of Polypodium fragrans^ from a French spe- 
cimen, totally at variance with that in his ‘ Species Plantarum 
it is as follows : “ Fronds bipinnate, pinnae ovate sublobate ob- 
tuse, beneath naked, the margin reflexed and the fructification 
marginal.”t In this description it appears to me that the obtuse 
pinnae (evidently pinnules) naked beneath, with reflexed margins 
and marginal fructification, are the characters of Lastrcea Ore' 
opteris ; few botanists have gathered Oreopteris without ob- 
serving that the margins of the pinnules if not originally reflexed 
almost immediately become so. Hudson, in his second edition, 
gives this second description as his character of the plant,4 so 
that we are left in the pleasing belief that in the first instance 
both authors described rigida^ in the second both Oreopteris. 
Abler botanists must hereafter decide what course is to be

adopted in the nomenclature ; for the present I adhere to that I 
have previously employed. It may also be mentioned that the 
present plant appears to be the Polypodium fragrans of Villars’ 
plants of Dauphine,* (although Swartz thinks otherwise, and 
has redescribed Villars’ plant under the new name of Villarii), 
and the Aspidium fragrans of Gray’s ‘Natural Arrangement of 
British Plants :’ f with respect to the latter author, it should be 
particularly observed that his Aspidium fragrans is not to be 
supposed identical with either Thelypteris or Oreopteris, since 
both these species are also described, the former under the name 
of palustre^ the latter under that of odoriferum. In Hooker 
and Greville’s ‘ leones Filicum ’J the name of Neplirodium fra- 
grans is given to a fern collected by Captain Parry during one 
of his arctic voyages, and the Linnean name of Polypodium 
fragrans is given as a synonym. The Pev. W. S. Hore informs 
me he has a specimen of a similar fern, collected by Mr. Grif- 
fiths on Melvill Island. Miss Beever has obligingly sent me the 
following quotation from one of Rousseau’s ‘ Lettres sur la 
Botanique.’ — “ Je crois me rappeler par exemple qu’il le trouve 
quelques fougeres, entre autres le Polypodium fragrans que j’ai 
herborise en Angleterre, et qui ne sont pas communes partout.” 
Rousseau’s residence in this country being Wootton Hall, in 
Staffordshire, this fern was probably L, Oreopteris, Lastreea 
rigida of this work is synonymous with Polystichum strigosum 
of Roth.§ 

The roots are long, and the rhizoma large and tufted : the 
stem is unusually thick at the base, and is very densely clothed 
with large red scales, which are present, though less abundant, 
throughout its entire length ; the proportion of the stem to the 
frond varies betweeen a fourth and half : the frond is nearly 
erect, pinnate, and is in habit a good deal like L. Filix-mas ; 
its form is variable, as I have already shown by the quotation 
from Mr. Pinder’s letter ; the extreme of the lanceolate and tri- 
angular form are shown in the two figures ; the pinnules are 
more or less crowded ; those towards the base are more distant

than those in the middle and upper part of the fi*ond, they are 
also sometimes shorter and somewhat triangular, but this cha- 
racter appears rather the exception than the rule, for in the spe- 
cimens so kindly and liberally supplied me, I find by far the 
greater number have the first pair of pinnae fully as long as 
either of the others : all the pinnae are pinnate ; the pinnules 
are somewhat stalked, and so deeply divided into lobes as to 
appear almost pinnatifid ; the lobes are 
toothed, the teeth being without spines. 
This character I consider of importance as 
offering an excellent diagnostic whereby 
readily to distinguish the present species 
from the whole tribe of crested ferns, with 
which it appears to have been formerly con- 
founded. The mid-vein of the pinnule is 
waved ; the lateral veins are alternate, and 
each is forked almost immediately after 
leaving the mid-vein : the posterior branch 
is again divided, and each ramifies into a 
serrature of the lobe : the anterior branch 
bears a circular cluster of capsules about midway between the 
mid-vein and margin ; these masses, which are ten or twelve in 
each pinnule, are almost approximate, and finally become com- 
pletely confluent ; each of the masses is covered by a reniform 

lead-coloured involucre, which is at- 
tached to the vein by a short stalk 
placed in the lateral notch. The up- 
per figure in the margin shows the 
veins and the points of attachment of the capsules ; the lower 
figure shows the clusters of capsules with their involucres in J 
the natural situation. The involucre is furnished with a fringe 
of stalked glands, as represented at page 191, Over the upper | 
surface of the frond are scattered numerous minute, spherical, | 
and nearly sessile glands ; from these, in all probability, is emit- | 
ted the scent which has caused so many authors to call this || 
plant by the name of fragrans. Mr. Finder called my attention |j 
to these glands ; he informs me they are more conspicuous in the i 
living than the dried plant, and impart to it a glaucous hue. i

This is a most abundant species, and one which seems to de- 
light in wooded and cultivated districts : although scattered over 
every part of the kingdom, it is ever most abundant in rich soil 
and shady situations : it lives to a great age, and the fronds of 
each succeeding year appear to increase in size. 

It is found in every country of Europe, and is widely distri- 
buted in Asia and Africa. Beck gives it as a native of North 
America, but it does not occur in either of the collections I have 
seen from the United States. 

The figures of this fern are generally tolerably accurate, but 
it requires a little nicety in the drawing to make it perfectly dis- 
tinguishable from two or three others which approach it in 
general outline. 

The name of Filix-mas or Male Fern seems to be ascribed 
to the present species by universal consent. Gerarde, Ray, and 
all our earlier authors, give it one or both of these designations. 
This species may be considered the best illustration of Bory’s 
genus Lastrcea, and possesses the most perfect example of a 
reniform involucre that is to be found among British ferns. 

Its medicinal properties were formerly highly extolled. All our 
ancient herbalists agree as to its value as a vermifuge : Tragus 
prescribes the root for this purpose,* and Gerarde, quoting 
the authority of Dioscorides, writes thus. — The root of the 
Male Feme, being taken to the weight of halfe an ounce, driveth 
forth long flat worms as Dioscorides writeth, being drunke in 
Mede or honied water, and more effectually if it be given with 
tw'o scruples or two third parts of a dram of Scamonie or of 
black Hellebore : they that will use it must first eat Garlicke. 
The root hereof is reported to be good for them that have ill 
spleenes, and being stamped with swines grease and applied it 
is a remedy against the pricking of the reed.”f Tragus has a 
very curious passage on the subject of its curing wounds in- 
flicted by reeds, and says, that so great is the antipathy of the 
Male Fern and the reed to each other, that where one grows the

other will not. The same author recommends a piece of the 
root of this fern to be laid under the tongue of a horse that has 
fallen sick from any unknown cause : by this application the 
disease will be expelled, and the horse recovered.^' Indepen- 
dently of these quaint accounts we learn that the root was for- 
merly employed somewhat extensively in medicine ; but the 
result of my enquiries on this subject is, that the Male Fern has 
long since ceased to be a plant of importance to the apothecary in 
this country, although still in considerable use in Switzerland. 

Schkuhr says that this fern, together with its roots, us used in 
dressing leather, and the ashes in bleaching linen and in the 
manufacture of glass. In Norway its fronds serve as fodder for 
oxen, horses, sheep and goats : when dried it furnishes good 
litter for cattle, and when decayed is a valuable manure. 

“ Formerly,” continues the same author, this fern and its 
root were applied to many superstitious uses, since divers vaga- 
bonds prepared from the latter, together with its young incurved 
and yet unexpanded fronds, the so-called Liicky-hands or St, 
John’s hands, which they sold to ignorant and credulous people, 
both in town and country, as preservatives against witchcraft 
and enchantment. This still goes on in our own enlightened 
time, and it is a great scandal to Christianity that many men 
believe more in such things than in anything else. Only a few 
years ago a clergyman’s wife in this neighbourhood purchased 
one of these St. John’s hands for four shillings, and I have 
known others buy little bits cut from such a hand for four to eight 
groschen, to be given in drink to their cattle, as a means of pro- 
tecting them against enchantment and witchcraft : it is a pity 
that such remedies will not also protect us against death.”f 
Tragus also informs us that some of the uses to which this fern 
were formerly applied are too scandalous to relate. It is very 
amusing to find almost every one of these old botanists bewailing 
the wickedness and credulity of times gone by, yet recommending

herbs for the most improper uses, or assigning to them the most 
marvellous powers : our old friend Gerarde, after many a kind 
warning to his readers against credulity, winds up his ‘ Herbal ’ 
with an avowal of his implicit faith in the Bernacle goose. 

The roots are extremely strong and tough ; they are of a dark 
brown colour, and penetrate very deeply into the earth ; the 
rhizoma is tufted : if in a favorable situation it elongates slightly 
every year, so that in very old plants it makes a decided ap- 
pearance above ground, and the crown of the rhizoma, whence 
spring the fronds, appears to be seated on a short stem ; it more 
often, however, assumes a pendant position, as represented at 
page 197, the crown of the rhizoma curving at the extremity, 
and the fronds growing in a nearly erect position. This elon- 
gation of the rhizoma in L. Filix-mas (a character still more 
decided in Athyrium Filix-femina), affords us a clew to that 
erect and elongated part which is called the ^Hrunk” of Tree 
Ferns. It is inconsistent with analogy to suppose that genera, 
which are so obviously allied in every other character, should 
be so totally different in this, as for one to possess a trunk and 
the other to be entirely without it. 

The fronds make their appearance in May : at first they are 
perfectly circinate, but after a few days the apex of each is libe- 
rated, and hangs down, the frond at this period possessing the 
bend w’hich characterises a shepherd’s crook, as represented at 
page 197. In this state it is very tender, and is generally cut 
down by the late frosts of spring ; the loss is, however, quickly 
supplied ; a second series of fronds make their appearance, and 
expanding at a more congenial time, arrive in safety at maturity. 
The fronds are mature in August, and last to the middle of win- 
ter quite uninjured : they are generally fertile, but plants are 
not of unfrequent occurrence which produce only barren fronds ; 
and these are generally larger, greener, and have the pinnules 
more deeply serrated than when fertile. The fronds vary from 
five to ten or more in number ; their position is nearly erect, or, 
perhaps, somewhat slanting, and radiating from a common cen- 
tre. The length of the fronds averages between two and three 
feet, and the stem is naked nearly one-third of its length, and 
very chaffy.

The form of the frond is lanceolate and pinnate : the lower 
pinnae are considerably shorter than those of the middle of the 
frond, but never approach the diminutive size of those of h. 
Oreopteris : all the pinnae are nearly linear, but acute at the 
apex ; they are regularly pinnate : the pinnules are obtuse, some- 
what pinnate at the extremities, and serrated at their margins. 

The lateral veins are forked half-way between 
the midvein and margin : after the fork the an- 
terior branch bears a nearly circular cluster of 
capsules, which are covered by a smooth, lead- 
coloured, reniform involucre, which is attached 
to the back of the vein at the point where the 
stalks of the capsules are inserted : the invo- 
lucre is more perfect, conspicuous and lasting, 
than in any other British fern : the lateral veins 
do not quite reach the margin of the pinnules, 
and the anterior branch of each is not quite so long as the 
posterior. 

I am indebted to Miss Browne, of Tallantire Hall, near Cock- 
ermouth, for two remarkable forms of this plant which appear to 
be constant in that neighbourhood : these seem to vary in oppo- 
site ways ; the first has the pinnules larger, broader and more 
crowded, than is usually the case ; the second has them longer, 
narrower and more distant, as represented in the pinna, figure 
page 197 : the first superior pinnule is generally much longer 
than the first inferior, a character also at variance with the usual 
structure of Filix-mas. This plant in habit and general ap- 
pearance much more nearly resembles Athyrium Filix-femina 
than the species which I am now describing, but the scales of 
the stem, the texture of the frond, and the characters of the in- 
volucre (although I have only seen it after the bursting of the 
capsules), are decidedly those of Filix-mas, or a closely allied 
species. A third strange example of variation occurs in a spe- 
cimen preserved in the herbarium of the late Mr. Winch, now 
in possession of the Linnean Society of London. This variety 
is precisely analogous to the lonchitiform specimens of Polysti- 
chum aculeatum, the pinnule being quite undivided : it does 
not appear to be a young or seedling plant, being as fully fruited,

in proportion to its size, as the fronds of larger growth : a figure 
of this remarkable specimen is introduced in the margin. A 

fourth departure from the usual form 
occurs near Stormont house, Belfast, 
growing in company with great abun- 
dance of Polystichum angular e, the 
usual form of Lastrana Filix-mas and 
Athyrium Filix-femma. The points 
of discrepancy are these : frond nar- 
row, elongate, pinnules very distant ; 
clusters of capsules small, separate and 
distinct : I am indebted to Mr. Moore 
for a specimen of this curious fern. A 
fifth form occurs on the limestone dis- 
trict of the north of England, in com- 
pany with Lasirma rigida : I am in- 
debted to Mr. Finder for an example 
from Ingleborough : in this plant the 
great discrepancy exists in the smaller 
size, a foot being its extreme length, and 
in having its large clusters of capsules 
confined to the bases of the pinnules, 
where they form a crowded confluent 
line, which completely covers the midrib 
of the pinna. From a very careful com- 
parison of this plant with the descrip- 
tion of Decandolle’s Polystichum ah- 
hreviatum,^ I am induced to pronounce 
them identical, yet scarcely incline to 
consider the discrepancy from the usual 
form of Filix-mas sufficient for the 
establishment of a species. Mr. Bor- 
rer and Mr. Cameron have also noticed two forms of this fern, 
one of which is distinguished by the abundance of golden-co- 
loured scales, which cover almost every part of the plant. The 
pinna a at page 197 is of the natural size and normal form.

This is one of our most local ferns, occurring only on boggy 
heaths, and confined, as far as Great Britain is concerned, to 
four English counties. 

Cheshire. — Mr. Finder had the good fortune to discover this 
fern in Wybunbury bog, in this county, and has supplied me 
liberally with specimens. 

Norfolk. — The Rev. R. B. Francis was, I believe, the disco- 
verer of this fern in Norfolk, in the year 1805 ; it was growing 
among furze-bushes by the side of a drain ; it has since been 
found in abundance at Edgefield by Mr. Wigham, and on Baw- 
sey heath, near Lynn, by Mr. Ewing, the Rev. Mr. Mumford, 
and Mr. Burlingham : it grows intermixed with the common 
ling, and is shaded by a few young alder trees. Mr. Burling- 
ham, of Lynn, discovered a fourth Norfolk station in 1841 ; it 
is near the village of Dersingham, between seven and eight miles 
from Lynn, on the road to Hunstanton : in this station there are 
fewer roots, and it does not grow so luxuriantly as at Bawsey, 
probably owing to there being less moisture and no shade, as 
here it grows among ling unaccompanied by alders. I have to 
acknowledge my obligation to the Botanical Society of London, 
and to Mr. S. P. Woodward, for a fine series of specimens. 

Nottinghamshire. — In this county it was first discovered by 
Dr. Howitt at Oxton bogs, and has since been found at the same 
locality by Mr. Riley, Mr. Quekett, Mr. Sidebotham, and seve- 
ral other botanists : Mr. Sidebotham has also observed it at 
Bulwell marshes. I am indebted to Mr. Riley and Mr. Kippist 
for specimens from this county. 

Suffolk. ~ Sir J. E. Smith records that it was gathered by 
Mr. Davy on bogs amongst alder bushes, at Westleton, in this 
county.^ I do not possess specimens. 

Mr. Mackay gives this fern as a native of Ireland, f and Sir W. 
Hooker as a native of Scotland. J I have seen no specimens 

from either of these countries.

ehrhart’s fern. 


205 


This fern is of common occurrence on the continent of Eu- 
rope, and throughout the United States of North America. I 
have received American specimens from Mr. Oakes, Mr. Lea, 
and Mr. Boott, the latter accompanied by living plants, which, 
have been growing for two years at Leominster, side by side with 
others from Lynn ; and although Mr. Lea, of Cincinnati, informs 
me that Dr. Torrey considers the American plant distinct, I 
must confess that the two appear to me to be identical. 

This species is well figured in the ^ Flora Londinensis.’^ In 
Sowerby’s ‘ English Botany ’ the name occurs twice : plate 
1949 represents Lastraa Filix-maSy and plate 2125 appears to 
be intended for the present species, but is not characteristic. 
In describing L. Filix-mas Sir J. E. Smith remarks “ This 
species was certainly never mistaken for A. cristatum by the 
writer of ‘English Botany,’ p. 1949, but Mr. Sowerby was de- 
ceived by a wrong specimen sent him from the Isle of Wight, 
which he supposed of course to be correct, and from which he 
drew the figure. The blunder was set right in v. 30, p. 2125, 
of the same work.”f 

The name of cristatum was evidently intended by Linneus 
to comprise the present and the next species. Hudson, Berk- 
enhout. Withering, and Bolton, adopt from Linneus the name of 
Polypodium cristatum, but apparently without any knowledge 
of the present species. Ehrhart was the first to describe the 
plant as a distinct and separate species, under the elegant name 
of CallipterisyX which has been adopted by Lamarck and 
Decandolle,§ perhaps the best nomen claturists of the continent. 
It becomes a question concerning which much might be ad- 
vanced on both sides, whether the name of Linneus or Ehrhart 
ought to stand : it appears to me to issue in the adoption of the 
Linnean name, since it happens that the author has selected a 
frond of this, the rarer species, as the authentic representative 
of his Polypodium cristatum. I am, however, compelled to re- 
linquish the English name of “ crested,” as having been em- 
ployed by Hudson, Withering, &c., to a different species ; indeed

SO great is the confusion respecting ‘^the crested fern” that 1 
have determined to omit the name altogether. 

The roots of Lastrcea cristata are 
dark brown, numerous, and often matted 
together : the rhi^oma is very stout, and 
gradually increases in length, as the 
plant increases in age, occasionally emit- 
ting a lateral branch, which in due time 
also becomes branched, so that an old 
plant is sometimes possessed of a very 
I Tom ^ ^ JlW extensive and complicated rhizoma, 

^ which throws up fronds from all its ex- 
tremities. The base of the stem of each 
frond, instead of decaying with the 
frond, retains its sap and vigour for 
many years, and in time assumes so 
nearly the appearance of the rhizoma 
that it is difficult to distinguish between 
the two. The figure in the margin, al- 
though perhaps not very ornamental, 
gives a correct idea of a longitudinal 
section of a portion of rhizoma. It is 
drawn of the natural size, and consti- 
( ^ tutes but a small portion of the plant 
from which it was taken : the median 
wdiite space represents the rhizoma it- 
self, and the shorter ascending white 
spaces on either side represent the still 
vigorous bases of old stems, with the 
exception of a small branch of rhizoma 
^ bottom of the figure on the 

right hand side. In the specimen I se- 
lected for illustration the interstices be- 
tween the bases of the stems, represented 
by the darker portion of the figure, were 
filled with matted roots and turfy soil ; 
on removing which I found every part of the surface of the rhi- 
zoma, and also the bases of the fmnd-stems, covered with

rudely semi-lunar markings, which seemed to indicate the former 
points of attachment for those chaffy scales with which the 
crown of the rhizoma, as well as stems of almost every 
species of Lastr(Ea, appear to abound : a figure of 
the base of an old frond-stem exhibiting this charac- 
ter is given in the margin. 

The fronds are but few in each tuft, and rise from 
the crown of each growing branch of the rhizoma ; 
they appear in May, and remain green till near the 
end of the year. The form of the young unexpanded 
frond somewhat resembles that of Lastrcea Oreopteris; 
the general character is circinate, but the pinnae are 
perfectly flat, the lower pair being incumbent on the 
second, the second on the third, and so on. Young 
expanded fronds, of the natural size, are shown at h, p. 203 ; in 
every instance they were sketched from living and growing ex- 
amples, a vigorous plant having been most obligingly sent me 
by Mr. R. Jacob. The stem is of nearly equal length with the 
frond, very erect, and clothed with scattered, broad, obtuse, 
short, semi-transparent, pale brown, uniformly coloured scales. 
The frond itself is erect, narrow, linear and pinnate : the pinnae, 
which are attached by the stalk only, are generally rather dis- 
tant, short, broad at the base, nearly triangular and pinnate, or 
deeply pinnatifid : the pinnules are very blunt at the apex, and 
serrated both at the apex and along the sides ; they are generally 
decurrent or united at the base, and almost invariably attached 
to the midrib of the pinnae by their greatest diameter. When 
the frond is very luxuriant and fruitful the pinnae become much 
more elongate, and the pinnules more remote. 

The lateral veins of the pinnules are many-branched, and 
the anterior branch bears a circular cluster of capsules about 
half-way between the midvein and margin : the clusters are co- 
vered by a flat, reniform involucre, the margins of which are 
sinuate, but not jagged or torn ; and I have not been able to 
detect, either on its margin or disk, the slightest appearance of 
glands. In luxuriant specimens the clusters are much crowded, 
and finally become confluent ; they are always confined to the 
upper part of the frond.

N looking more carefully into those 
similarities which I supposed of suffi- 
cient importance to warrant the asso- 
ciation of many forms under the spe- 
cific name of dilatata, I find them 
invariably the concomitants of youth 
rather than the characteristics of per- 
fection, and they become by degrees 
more and more obliterated, as the plants year by year advance 
towards maturity. The differences, on the other hand, so equi- 
vocally developed in seedling or starved individuals, become 
distinctly pronounced in the adult and vigorous ; and a com- 
parison of these, leaves me no choice but to cancel my former 
observations as erroneous, and to consider the names dilatata 
and spinulosa as having been applied to a family rather than to 
a species. Admitting this, it becomes a task of great delicacy 
to select an individual which shall bear alone all the honors of 
either patronymic. Fully appreciating the difficulty of the case, 
I have omitted both these names, and employed others which 
were originally, as now, restricted to one species.

This fern appears to be ubiquitous in the moist woods and 
marshes of England, as far as I have had an opportunity of vi- 
siting them. In Wales it does not occur so commonly, and I 
have not yet seen it in Scotland or Ireland. As this species is 
so little known, and so seldom recognized as distinct from the 
following, I cannot quote with confidence any information I have 
received from correspondents as to its distribution. 

It certainly occurs in Germany, Sweden, and Hungary ; but 
beyond these countries I am unable to trace its geographical 
range. I am indebted to Mr. Boott for two allied but apparently 
distinct species from the United States. 

I am unacquainted with any figure of this fern. 

The nomenclature of this species is involved in much ob- 
scurity. I hesitate to pronounce a positive opinion upon the 
subject; but, as already stated, I entertain no doubt that Lin- 
neus included it under his Polypodimn cristatum, which he 
describes as growing “ sylvis scepe uligmosis.''^^ There is some 
difficulty in fixing an exact meaning to these words, but if we 
translate them literally, “ frequently in marshy woods,” we shall 
have a very correct definition of the usual locality of L. spinosa ; 
but it also occurs frequently in marshes, and there mingling with 
cristata, so closely approaches it in appearance, that I have 
found the greatest difficulty in separating them. The Linnean 
character serves equally well for both species ; and the descrip- 
tio7i, confining the fructification to the upper fronds, throws no 
light whatever on the subject, that character being possessed by 
both species, and distinguishing them from the two next follow- || 
ing. Under L. cristata, I have shown why I restrict the Lin- I 
nean name to that species. It seems to me that Mullerf had | 
neither the merit of separating the two plants, nor any inten- P 
tion of giving a new name, but again describes them as one J 
species, and merely adopts and misprints Weiss’ prior name of 
spinosa.% As for his figure, cited by Withering, it represents but #! 
the apical portion of a frond, the decurrent and united pinnulesg 
of which resemble L, cristata, while the creeping rhizoma alsoM

withering’s fern.

more nearly resembles that than the present species ; I cannot 
therefore consent to separate the spmulosa of Muller from the 
cristata of Linneus. Like Linneus, he probably included both 
the plants, but neither in his figure nor description do I find 
any reason for supposing he restricted his spimilosa to the pre- 
sent species. 

Berkenhout^ adopts the Linnean name, describing the habitat 
as ‘^woods &c.” and restricting the fruit to the superior pinnae. He 
appears quite ignorant of the rarer species, and confines the name 
to the present only. Withering, on the contrary, adopts Muller’s 
name, but also appears to restrict it to a single species. These 
authors’ descriptions were published almost simultaneously, but 
Withering has the merit of distinguishing the following species 
from the present, an attempt in which every other British author 
has failed. It is, however, but an act of justice to four of our 
best botanists — Mr. Wilson of Warrington, Mr. Borrer of Hen- 
field, Mr. Jenner of Lewes, and Mr. Forster of London- — to say 
that they have always maintained that the two plants were distinct 
as species ; and I am indebted to all these gentlemen for valu- 
able communications on this interesting and intricate subject. 

The confusion among continental authors is quite as great as 
in this country, and Roth is the only one, as far as my infor- 
mation extends, who has properly distinguished between them : 
his description 1 have quoted below ; t and though I cannot 
but regret that his name of spinosa should so nearly resemble

present plant, when it was supposed to be a mere variety of 
A tliyrium Fi lix-femina . 

This fern is closely allied to the preceding, indeed, so much 
do they resemble each other, that I have found it next to im- 
possible to fix on satisfactory diagnostics whereby to distinguish 
them. The roots are nearly black, numerous, and often matted 
together ; the rhizoma is very stout, and gradually increases in 
length and becomes branched, as in L. cristata, but perhaps 
rarely to so great an extent, yet I have occasionally seen in 
woods, patches that occupied many square yards, and on dig- 
ging amongst the fronds with a trowel, have found the tufts so 
much connected with each other, as to justify the supposition 
that the whole owed its existence to an original single rhizoma. 
The fronds, on rising from the ground in April and May, present 
a different appearance from those of L. cristata. The margins of 
the pinn 80 are more convolute than in that species, and never 
possess the flattened formation which I have mentioned as cha- 
racteristic of L. cristata. The stem is about equal in length 
to the frond, and nearly erect; it is clothed with blunt or round- 
ed, semitransparent, uniformly coloured scales, so similar to those 
of the preceding species, that 1 cannot distinguish between them. 
One of these scales is represented by the left hand figure at p. 
214. I consider this character alone quite sufficient to separate 
the species from either of those which follow. The frond is 
nearly erect ; more so when growing on marshes and commons 
than when in woods : it is long, narrow — but not so narrow as j 
the preceding, pinnate and linear, the pairs of pinnae from the 1 
first to the eighth inclusive, being generally of uniform length;] 
they are rather distant, and usually ascend at an acute anglel 
from the main stem. The pinnae are pinnate, and the pinnules I 
detached and often distant ; although connected by a slenderJ 
wing, they have a deep notch on each side at the base, a cha-i 
racter very rarely observable in L. cristata. On the first pair ofl 
pinnae the first and second inferior pinnules are of nearly equall 
length, and are nearly twice as long as the corresponding supe-* 


withering’s fern. 


213 


rior ones : this discrepancy between superior and inferior pin- 
nules gradually diminishes, and altogether ceases with the sixth 
pair, which are of equal length : a somewhat similar discrepancy 
is observable in the pinnules of the second pair of pinnae, but 
beyond these it becomes scarcely observable : some of the lower 
pinnules are deeply pinnatifid, almost pinnate : the lobes of the 
pinnules are toothed, and the teeth terminate in short but dis- 
tinct spines; each serrature with its accompanying spine has a 
decided curvature towards the apex of the pinnule. The entire 
frond is characterized by a flat surface, having neither the con- 
vexity which distinguishes the species immediately following, 
nor the concavity which is characteristic of the next but one. 

The veins in the pinnules are alternately branched, each sys- 
tem of branches entering a division of the pinnule, and the an- 
terior branch bearing a circular cluster of capsules just within 
the sinus which occurs between each two divisions : this cluster 
is covered by a flat reniform involucre, the margins of which are 
sinuate, generally entire, and always without stalked glands, a 
character which, as far as my observation has extended, is con- 
stant, and is of great importance in distinguishing this species 
from those which follow, (see the left-hand figure at page 236). 
This character sufficiently distinguishes the present plant from 
the spinulosa of Swartz, Willdenow, Schkuhr and Francis, all 
of which 1 imagine to be mere varieties of the next species. 
Owing to the constant position of these clusters on each pinnule 
they form a regular double line, the midvein of the pinnule pass- 
ing up the centre : but when the pinnule is completely divided 
into lobes, each branch of the vein usually bears a cluster of cap- 
sules : this is more frequently the case in those pinnules which 
are nearest the main stem of the frond ; and it may be observed 
that the clusters on all except the usual cap side -bearing branch 
I are of smaller size. The seed, as pointed out by Linneus, Berk- 
enhout and Withering, is confined to the upper portion of the 
frond: exceptions to this are of rare occurrence. The clusters 
are usually distinct and perfectly separate, indeed I may say al- 
ways so when grown in woods, but on heaths they are more 
crowded, and I have seen specimens from Bawsey and Holt, in 
I which they are quite confluent. Each branch of the vein enters 


214 


ASPIDIACE^. 


one of the serratures of the pinnule, but terminates before reach- 
ing the spine, with which it is quite unconnected. 

It may be further observed, in comparison with the last spe- ; 
cies, that the pinnae are pinnate rather than pinnatifid ; the pin- 
nules, though sometimes connected with each other by a slender 
wing, are united to the midrib of the pinna by a very small por- 
tion of their basal diameter ; whereas in crista ta the pinnules 
are generally decurrent, and united to the midrib by their entire | 
basal diameter. The frond of spinosa is broader, its pinnae 
longer, the sixth, seventh and ninth pairs not longer than the 
first and second ; the pinnules sharper-pointed and more divid- | 
ed ; the spines longer and more obvious : still, in the more im- I 
portant characters of the scales of the stem and the structure of I 
the involucre, there is no perceptible difference ; and the dis- | 
tinctness of the two, as species, is scarcely established by the | 
trivial discrepancies which I have here noticed. |

I BELIEVE this fern to be universally distributed throughout 
the British Islands: it grows luxuriantly in moist woods, delight- 
ing in vegetable mould, and attains a great size on warm, shel- 
tered hedge-banks, particularly if accompanied by a ditch. I 
refrain from stating that under an altered and diminished form 
it ascends our highest mountains, since I consider it possible, 
that what is supposed a mountain form of the present plant, may 
eventually prove specifically distinct. 

This fern is so imperfectly known that I am unable to give its 
European range, but I believe it to be common on the continent. 
I have received no corresponding form from my friends in the 
United States. 

There is no figure to which I can with confidence refer as re- 
presenting this species. 

It may appear somewhat strange that I should be unable to 
find more than one intelligible description of this common plant, 
yet such is the case ; and I adopt Both’s name of muUiJloray 
not because it has the claim of priority, which is however pro- 
bably the case, but because I cannot make it out to be either 
the original Polypodium spinulosum, as supposed by Will- 
denow,^ Hooker,f and many other authors ; the Polypodium 
dilatatum of Hoffinann, as supposed by Smith,! Wahlenberg,§ 
and many others ; or the Polypodium cristatum of Linneus, 
as supposed by Bolton, || Withering,1[ &c. : nor do I believe 
that sufficient information will ever be gleaned from either 
Muller’s or Hoffmann’s description, to settle the point satisfac- 
torily in favour of either, and the Linnean name of cristatum, 
for reasons already given, I have assigned to a very different 
species. Roth’s description, as cited below,*^ is too clear and

to the present plant ; and I must observe, for the information of 
those who wish to go more fully into the question of date, that 
although this volume of the ‘ Flora Germanica ’ was published 
in 1800, the description of multijiora had previously appeared 
in the ‘ Catalecta Botanica,’^ and that the author claims for it 
priority over Hoffmann’s name of dilatatum, which he supposes 
may be intended for the same species. Be this as it may, I hope 
I shall find botanists willing to do honor to Roth’s admirable 
description by adopting his name, for of a truth we may exclaim 
with him , — Maximce sane et fere insuperabiles in determina-

The roots are numerous, black, wiry and very tenacious, the 
rhizoma large and tufted ; I have never found it elongated and 
branched, as in L. cristata and L. spinosa. The crown of the 
rhizoma is densely clothed with large long brown scales.

tion which I have not hitherto seen noticed; the main stem 
of the frond, instead of being regularly circinate, or composed of 
diminishing rings, like those of an Ionic volute, is doubled near 
the insertion of the second pair of pinnae, and turns back, form- 
ing a kind of loop. I have endeavoured to exemplify this in the 
accompanying figures, which are of the natural size. a shows 
the crown of the rhizoma before the fronds have begun to grow; 
h is the basal portion of the stem of a young frond, c, its apex; 
d shows the peculiar bend of the frond above described, and e 
the stem of the same frond in the same position, but stripped of 
its pinnae and scales. In favorable situations the fronds of 
mature plants, including the stem, measure five feet in length : 
this magnitude is, I believe, unequalled by any of our British 
ferns, except the common Brakes and Osmunda regalis. I se- 
lect for description a specimen for which I am indebted to Mr. 
John Ray of Epping, and first give its dimensions. Total length 
from the rhizoma to the apex of frond, sixty inches : from rhi- 
zoma to the insertion of the first pair of pinnae, twenty-four 
inches : from the insertion of the first pair of pinnae to the apex 
of frond, thirty-six inches. It must, however, be borne in mind 
that the relative length of the stem and frond is subject to great 
variation, being influenced by situation, degree of moisture, nature 
of soil, quantity of shade, and a number of other casualties. 
The length of the first pair of pinnae, seven and three quarter 
inches ; second pair, eight and a half inches ; third, eight and 
three quarters; fourth, nine inches; sixth, eight and three quar- 
ters ; seventh, eight ; eighth, seven ; ninth, six ; tenth, four and 
three quarters ; eleventh, four ; twelfth, three ; thirteenth, two 
and a half ; fourteenth, two : the remainder rapidly decrease in 
length, until the frond terminates in an acute point. The lengths 
of stem between the pairs of pinnae are these in the first in- 
stance four and a half inches ; in the second, three and a half; 
in the third, three and a quarter ; in the fourth, three ; in the 
fifth, two and a half ; in the sixth, two and a quarter ; in the 
seventh, two; in the eighth, one and three quarters ; in the ninth, 
one and a half ; in the tenth, one and a quarter ; in the eleventh, 
one ; in the twelfth, three quarters ; in the thirteenth, half an 
inch. From these admeasurements it will appear that the figure 


220 


ASPIDIACE^. 


of the frond may be described as oblong-lanceolate, and cannot, 
in any acceptation of the term, be characterized as deltoid or tri- 
angular, words which are almost invariably employed in the de- 
scription of what is named Aspidiurn dilatatum. And I may 
remark, that although I have examined some hundreds of mature 
fronds, I have never seen one more nearly triangular than that 
of which I have given the measurements : that triangular fronds 
do frequently occur, I will not dispute ; but these are from seed- 
ling or starved plants, or are without fruit, of diminutive size, or 
from some cause or other have not attained their normal form. 
The stem is very stout at the base, and thickly clothed with long, 
pointed scales, which are of a very dark brown colour along the 
middle, pale brown and nearly transparent at the side» : it is very 
possible that several species possess these scales, indeed, 1 am 
quite disposed to believe this is the case ; but the character is 
amply sufficient to distinguish this species from the preceding 
and following, which are generally confounded with it. One of 
these scales is represented by the middle figure at page 214. 
The frond is pinnate, the pinnae are nearly opposite, and as we 
have seen by the admeasurements, the pairs gradually approx- 
imate from the base towards the apex ; the first and second 
pairs are very broad at the base, in some instances nearly 
triangular : the third is longer and narrower ; the fourth, fifth, 
and sixth still longer and narrower, and also more linear, the 
sides being nearly parallel : all the pinnae are pinnate, except 
those quite at the apex of the frond : the pinnules are distinctly 
separate and almost stalked ; those of the upper pinnae are con- 
nected by an extremely slender wing of the midrib of the pinna, 
but this wing is not to be distinguished on the lower pinnae, 
except near the point : those on the lower pinnae are pinnate, on 
the middle pinnatifid, and on the upper deeply lobed : all the 
divisions are serrated, and each terminates in a short but distinct 
spine. In the first, second and third pairs of pinnae the inferior 
pinnules are much longer than the superior ; the first inferior 
pinnule of the first pair of pinnae is sometimes longer sometimes 
shorter than the second, but the first, second and third are al- 
most invariably much longer and altogether larger than those 


roth’s fern. 


2Q1 


which succeed them ; the diminution of the rest in size is some- 
times very abrupt, sometimes gradual. 

Each lateral vein supplies one lobe or division of a pinnule ; 
it is always branched, and almost every branch bears a circular 
cluster of capsules : the clusters therefore are much more nume- 
rous, scattered and irregular than in the preceding, and want 
that formal biserial appearance which distinguishes that species. 
They are covered by a very irregular but somewhat reniform in- 
volucre, whose margins are uneven, and more or less fringed 
with sessile or stalked transparent glandular bodies ; these are 
described as characteristic of Aspidium spiniilosum by Swartz, 
Schkuhr, Willdenow, Sadler and Francis, and the present plant 
is thus identified with the spimilosum of those authors. This 
involucre is represented by the middle figure at page 236. 

Contrasted with the preceding, Lastrcea multijlora is a much 
larger plant ; its fronds are much longer, broader, heavier, and 
of a deeper green colour ; their position curved or arched, of- 
ten pendulous, never erect, and every part of the frond, instead 
of being flat, has a tendency to be convex. When the fronds 
are young, every part of their under surface, more particularly 
the ribs, abounds with minute stalked glands, imparting a meal- 
iness of appearance to the plant, which distinguishes it from L. 
spinosa, as the same character separates P, Dryopteris and P. 
calcareum : again, in L. multijlora, every part of the frond is 
covered with capsules, except about the base of the first pair of 
pinnae, in which they are sometimes wanting ; in L. spinosa they 
are usually confined to the upper part of the frond. The divi- 
sions of the frond are much more numerous, and the number of 
clusters proportionably greater, but the large, long and pointed 
scales on the stem, with their dark middles and pale sides, will 
furnish botanists wdth the best and most constant character, 
since in the seedlings of the two species all characters of figure, 
cutting, size or fructification, are apt to be wanting. 

There are two forms, so different in many respects from the 
normal form of L. multijlora, that I feel great difficulty in giv- 
ing any opinion as to whether they are distinct species, or merely 
modifications of the one which I have now been describing. I 
do not however feel justified in making any further addition to 


222 


ASPIDIACE^. 


our list of species at present, and therefore merely enumerate 
them as varieties. 

Lastr(Ba muUiJlora, var. nana. 

This plant, of which a figure is given in 
the margin rather less than the natural size, 
is dwarf, rigid and convex in every part, and 
usually of a very dark green colour, some- 
times inclining to brown. The clusters of 
capsules are large, very distant, and conceal 
rather than are covered by a small shapeless 
involucre, on which I have never discovered 
the glands observable in the normal form of 
the plant. It is of frequent occurrence in the 
boggy and hill districts of Scotland and Ire- 
land, and I have seen it, although more spar- 
ingly, on the mountains of Wales. Its cha- 
racter did not appear changed by cultivation 
for two years at Leominster; yet I feel by no 
means satisfied that it is more than a starved 
state of the common plant, and if so, should 
not be admitted as a variety. 

LastT(£a multiflora, var. collina. 

I venture on giving this fern a distinguishing epithet, because 
neither of the descriptions of Polypodimn tanacetifolium, to 
which species I incline to refer it, is sufficiently definite to war- 
rant my giving it that name. The P. tanacetifoliwn is a species 
which appears to be almost unknown to living botanists. It was 
first described in 1795, by Hoffmann ; and as it may possibly 
turn out to be one of my three forms of Lastrcea multijiora, I 
shall quote the original description in a foot-note.* Rothf sup-

poses it to be merely a variety of his 
Polysticlium spinosum, but Lamarck 
and Decandolle admit it as a species 
without any hesitation, and say that it 
has been found by Desfontaines on the 
mountains of Auvergne.^' The only 
specimens I have seen of the British 
plant, are two small ones in the Smith- 
ian herbarium (which are labelled as 
having been raised by Mr. Shepherd 
from the seeds of Smith’s Aspidium 
dumetorum), and a few fronds collect- 
ed upon the hills of Westmoreland, 
Yorkshire and Lancashire : and I am 
indebted to the kindness of Miss Bee- 
ver and Mr. Finder for those which I 
possess from these localities. We 
must not, however, conclude that the 
species is rare, on account of its ab- 
sence from herbaria, since everything 
supposed to be referrible to dilatata^ 
is but too commonly rejected by the 
collector.

quoted, I fear tliat I shall be able to add scarcely anything more 
satisfactory. With regard to the outline of the frond, my spe- 
cimens are so various as to offer among themselves as great a 
contrast as we find between any two species of the genus : the 
extremes of form appear to be the regular deltoid and the narrow 
elongate-lanceolate, more gradually attenuated towards either 
end than the normal form of L. multijiora, I take the deltoid 
for the younger, and the lanceolate for the older plant : a root 
found by Mr. Finder near Chapel Styles in Westmoreland, bear- 
ing fronds of an intermediate form, produced in cultivation com- 
pletely lanceolate fronds. I therefore introduce a short descrip- 
tion of the lanceolate, supposing it the mature form. Stem half 
as long as the frond, which is elongate-lanceolate and pinnate, 
the pinnae are very distinct, and set on at nearly right angles 
with the main stem ; the first pair are obtusely deltoid, the se- 
cond elongate-deltoid, and the remainder nearly linear with acu- 
minate apices ; all are pinnate, the pinnae ovate obtuse, slightly 
auricled and regularly toothed ; their attachment to the mid- 
stem of the pinnae resembles that inZ. spinosa; there is less ap- 
pearance of a stalk than in L. multijlora, and the spines of the 
serratures are far less distinct than in either of these species. All 
the pinnae bear seed, but the lower pair less abundantly ; the 
clusters are proportionately larger than in L. multijlora : they 
are crowded and become confluent, completely hiding the mid- 
rib of the pinnules. The stem is pale green, with dark brown 
scales, much resembling in form and colour those of L. vriulti- 
Jlora, the involucre also, as far as I can learn from my specimens, 
exhibits no discrepancies. Should this fern prove distinct as a 
species, which I anticipate will be the case when we have more 
copious materials for forming an opinion, I beg to propose that 
it be called Lastrma collina^ and that it bear the English name 
of ‘‘ Finder’s Fern,” in compliment to the gentleman who first 
called my attention to its remarkable difference from the usual 
form of L. multijlora ; provided always that it proves to be 
undescribed. 

I am indebted to Mr. Finder for a fourth very beautiful variety, 
which occurs at Madeley, Staffordshire ; but as this seems con- 
fined to a few examples, 1 forbear further notice of it.

This beautiful fern grows amidst grass in exposed and rocky 
situations, and also abounds in warm and sheltered woods, es- 
pecially in the vicinity of water-courses ; the latter appears its 
natural habitat, since in the former situation it is dwarf, less co- 
piously fruited, and appears altogether less healthy and vigorous. 

I am compelled to neglect many communications which possibly 
refer to this species, because I find the plant so imperfectly 
known. In every locality mentioned, I have either seen the 
plant growing, or possess specimens. It must by no means be 
presumed that I suppose the English range confined to the three 
counties I have mentioned, but these are the only English 
habitats for the accuracy of which I am enabled to vouch from 
actual observation.

Alfred Greenwood, for specimens from the vicinity of Penzance.

Sussex. — I am indebted to Mr. Bree for a specimen procured

for several others, gathered at Eridge rocks, Tunbridge Wells. 
Mr. Jenner had also the kindness to conduct me to the spot 
where it abounds, and thus afforded me the pleasure of examin- 
ing the plant in every stage, while yet growing : I found that 
every character seemed to justify the opinion I had formed in 
Ireland four years previously, of its being perfectly distinct from 
multijlora. Mr. Luxford has found the same plant upon the 
moist, wooded slope opposite the rocks at West Hoathly. 

I have not observed this fern in Wales, neither have I receiv- 
ed a single specimen from any part of the principality. 

From Scotland I have seen no specimen, neither have I ob- 
served it in my walks in that country. 

In Ireland it is very abundant, and indeed is quite one of the 
commoner ferns.

have excited the admiration of many botanists. Mr. Ogilby, of 
Dublin, writes thus : — “ This is, in my opinion, the most beau- 
tiful of our robust ferns : in style of growth and elegance of form 
it is most striking ; it presents two tiers of fronds, if I may so 
describe them, the lower more pendulous, the upper more erect, 
and it is on the more erect fronds that the fructification is most 
perfectly developed : the dark purple stem contrasting with the 
light green and crisped appearance of the pinnae give a peculi- 
arly elegant feature to the plant : it likes the seclusion of trees, 
and places where it is not pressed by other vegetation ; on spots 
about Dinis Island, and more particularly under Cromaglaun 
mountain, it may be seen fully developing all its loveliness.” 
At O’Sullivan’s cascade, in the same neighbourhood, I ob- 
served it in the most graceful and beautiful luxuriance ; it forms 
a chief ornament of that exquisite little waterfall. I am indebted 
to Mr. Ogilby and Mr. S. P. Woodward for specimens from the 
vicinity of Killarney, and to Dr. Taylor, of Dunkerron castle, for 
others from the neighbourhood of Kenmare.

the exposed and bare rocks it is very diminutive, but in the

specimens growing in the woods about Killarney. 

I should add that Mr. Borrer and Mr. Jenner, both of whom 


228 


ASPIDIACE.E. 


are well acquainted with this species, and consider it perfectly 
distinct, have given me other habitats in Herefordshire, Merio- 
nethshire and Sussex. 

Beyond the limits of our own country I am unable to trace 
the range of Lastrcea recurva, 

I am not aware of the existence of any figure of this fern, 
excepting those which are presented to the reader in the present 
volume : for that given below I am indebted to the kindness of 
the late lamented Mr. Loudon ; to whose readiness to oblige, 
and to render assistance on all subjects connected with Natural 
History, I am glad to have an opportunity of bearing my hum- 
ble and grateful testimony. 

The following notices respecting this fern have occurred. 

The Rev. W. T. Bree, in a paper on Cornish plants written for 
the fourth volume of Loudon’s ‘Magazine of Natural History,’ 
mentions Aspid, dilatatum var. recurvum for the first time under 
that name, and in a foot-note gives the following description. 

“This fera I have very little doubt is really a distinct species; 
and one which I believe has not hitherto been described, at least 
not as a native of Britain. Although it strikes the eye immediately 
as being different from Aspidium dilatatum^ it is difficult, I con- 
fess, to seize upon those permanent 
characters by which it is to be distin- 
guished. The minute divisions of 
the leaflets in Aspidium dilatatum 
frequently droop or curl under, while 
the corresponding parts in the present 
subject invariably curl back or up- 
wards in an exactly contrary direction 
[see fig. JJ, and thus give the whole 
frond a singularly crisped appearance. 
But the strongest character by which 
it may be distinguished from its near 
ally, consists in the lowest pair of 
pinnae or leaflets being much larger 
than the others, which is not the case 
in A. dilatatum ; so that the frond assumes a deltoid or tri- 
angular form, broadest at the base, and tapering to the apex. 



bree’s fern. 


229 


The fern occurs plentifully in the neighbourhood of Penzance, 
growing in situations similar to those in which A. dilatatum is 
found. I have also met with it in several parts of Ireland, par- 
ticularly near Killarney, and have received plants of it from the 
celebrated cryptogamist, the late Mr. James Dickson, who pro- 
cured it from Sussex, and considered it as a distinct species. Like 
A. dilatatum^ it is a very variable species, the plant differing 
greatly in size according to the situation in which it grows : on 
very dry banks I have found perfect fructifying fronds not more 
than a few inches high.” ^ 

Sir W. Hooker, in the fourth edition of the ‘ British Flora,’ 
refers to this observation of Mr. Bree’s, but does not retain the 
plant even as a variety.-f 

In a paper on the Botany of Erris, published in the ‘ Ma- 
gazine of Zoology and Botany,’! Mr. Babington notices the 
occurrence of our fern in that district, and refers to Sir W. J. 
Hooker’s, but not Mr. Bree’s notice of the plant. The next 

notice occurs in a communication of my own to the ‘ Magazine 
of Natural History,’ which is in these words : — 

“The third form [of dilatatum~\ is short, less rigid and erect, 
bright pale green and concave, not simply as a frond, but every 
pinna and pinnule also concave ; this I believe to be the Aspi- 
diwn dumetorum of Mackay,§ the Asp. dilatatum var. concavum 
of Babington, and the Asp. spinulosum of the Botanic Garden at 
Belfast, &c. This form is far more distinct and constant than 
any variety we possess in England.” || 

Subsequently to the publication of this passage, I received the 
following note from Mr. Moore of Dublin. “ On my way hither 
I called at the Liverpool Botanic Garden, where Mr. Shepherd 
showed me the identical plant which Sir James Smith described 
his Aspidium dumetorum from, and I can without the least 
hesitation pronounce it to be the Aspidium concavum of Ba- 
bington, which fact I thought might be interesting to you. I 
consider Babington’s name a good one, and likely to assist much

in determining the variety, as I have never seen it without the 
pinnules being more or less concave.” 

In consequence of this information I altered the passage when 
I reprinted my ^ Notes on Irish Natural History,’ as follows : — 

“ The third [form of dilatatum] is the Aspidium dumetorum 
of Smith and Mackay, the Asp. dilatatum var. concavum of 
Babington, the Asp. dilatatum recurvum of Bree, and the Asp. 
spinidosum of the Botanic Garden at Belfast, &c. This form 
is far more distinct and constant than any other with which I 
am acquainted.” ^ 

These views were repeated in the first edition of the ‘ History 
of British Ferns.’ 

The Rev. W. T. Bree, in a late communication to ‘ The Phy- 
tologist,’ claims for this fern the rank of a species, I shall quote 
the entire passage. 

The announcement of a new edition of your ^ British Ferns ’ 
induces me to trouble you wfith a remark, for which you may 
perhaps find room in ‘ The Phytologist.’ In the 4th vol. of the 
‘Magazine of Natural History,’ under the head of ‘List of Rare 
Plants found in the neighbourhood of Penzance’ (p. 162), I men- 
tioned, among other things, Aspidium dilatatum, var. recurvum, 
not knowing how else to designate what I believed to be an un- 
described British fern ; and in a note at the foot of the page I 
expressed an opinion to that effect. Since the publication of 
that list, the fern has been noticed by several botanists, and re- 
corded by yourself as a variety of dilatatum. I am perfectly 
aware that dilatatum is a most variable species, assuming as it 
does very different appearances according to soil, situation, 
shade, moisture, &c. Recurvum is equally given (if I may so 
say) to “ ring the changes ” on variety, but to a practised eye it 
is, in all its forms, readily distinguishable from every form of 
dilatatum. And I now beg to say, that after close observa- 
tion of the fern in the neighbourhood of Penzance, in the 
year 1817, and on the Irish mountains some years previously, as 
well as from an intimate acquaintance with the plant in a culti- 
vated state from that time to the present, I am confirmed in my

bree’s fern. 


231 


opinion, that the fern in question is a species distinct from dila- 
tatum ; and as such I hope to see it noticed in your forthcom- 
ing new edition of ^ British Ferns.’ 

In the ‘Naturalists’ Almanack’ for 1844, the species first 
received the name of Lastraea recurva. t 

The history of the fern is thus brought down to the present 
period ; and it seems needful to show why, after receiving such 
excellent evidence on the subject as I have quoted from the pen 
of Mr. Moore, and even adopting Mr. Moore’s view, as 1 subse- 
quently did, I should reject the name of dumetorum^ which has 
so clearly the claim of priority. My reasons for preferring Mr. 
Bree’s name are these. Mr. Bree’s figure and descriptions most 
evidently refer to the plant now under consideration, and the 
original specimens which he has most kindly transmitted to me, 
are beyond all question identical with my own. On the con- 
trary, Sir James Smith’s description, which I now proceed to 
quote, does not allude to any one of the distinguishing charac- 
ters of the species. 

“ Frond doubly pinnate ; leaflets pinnatifid, lobes with termi- 
nal, sharp, prickly teeth. Common stalk scaly. Cover orbicu- 
lar, flat, with a deep notch. ^ About one third the size 

of the last [ A. dilatatum}, with which it agrees in general habit 
and structure, but the leaflets are rather more ovate, and their 
segments more closely crowded together, less serrated at the 
sides, but their bristly teeth more numerous at the extremity 
of each segment. Masses few, small and rather scattered. Co- 
ver thin, pale, flat, not tumid nor kidney-shaped, but more orbi- 
cular, with a deep notch at the lower part, and finally turned 
loosely aside by the few rather large, shining, brown capsules, 
whose rings are very apparent. Sometimes the masses are pla- 
ced at the very edges or points of the segments, and the covers 
are often torn, but they are never tumid like a kidney, nor fixed 
closely by their outer margin, as those of A. dilataium are. I 
think these two species may always be distinguished by the si- 
tuation of their fructification and the nature of their covers.” J

sian herbarium, as identical with his Asp. dumetorum : after a 
careful examination of the herbarium, with the assistance of Mr. 
Bennett, I cannot find a specimen of the present plant ; and in 
Smith’s own herbarium, at the house of the Linnean Society, the 
species is represented by two seedling and evidently diseased 
fronds of Lastraea multijlora, so that we really have no evi- 
dence beyond the Liverpool specimens, to which^I must again 
recur, that the Aspidium dumetorum of Smith and the Aspidi- 
um recurvum of Bree are synonymous : and therefore I have no 
choice but to follow the author whose description I understand, 
and with whose plant I am well acquainted. 

A paragraph from the pen of the late lamented Mr. D. Don, 
to whom I am under so many obligations for information on 
every branch of my subject, will, I think, prove the correctness 
of my statement as to Sir J. E. Smith’s authentic specimens : it 
is published in the ‘ Transactions of the Linnean Society of 
London,’ and is quoted verbatim below. 

“ This [Aspidium dumetorum'] is made up of two plants, the 
one, from Cromford moor, being a dwarf state of A. dilatatum, 
and the other, from Ravelston wood, near Edinburgh, having the 
segments of the frond abruptly truncate, and the habit at first 
sight altogether peculiar ; but an inspection of the original speci- 
mens in the Smithian herbarium, proves it to be nothing more than 
an accidental variety of the same species, namely, Aspidium dila- 
tatum, arising from disease, which is shown by the sudden ter- 
mination of the costae, and by the partial decay of the other 
segments. Specimens of the more ordinary state of A. dilatatum, 
gathered at the same time and from the same locality, are simi- 
larly affected but in a less degree. The distinctions derived 
from the fructification in the ^English Flora,’ are altogether falla- 
cious, and are partly dependant on the age of the frond, and partly 
on that of the individual plant. It is clear therefore that the 
Aspidium dumetorum must be erased from the list of species.”* 

With regard to the Liverpool plants now cultivated by Mr. 
Shepherd, I had carefully examined them, and found them pre- 
cisely identical with the plant I am now describing, previously 


* Trans. Linn. Soc. xvii. 435.

233 


to the date of Mr. Moore’s letter on the subject: but I think 
there is some little error in supposing that the identical plant 
described by Smith is still in existence. Sir J. E. Smith ex- 
pressly describes the Liverpool plants as raised from the seed of 
a Derbyshire specimen of Asp. dumetorum ; and I think all 
those who have raised ferns from seedj and observed the strange 
and unexpected results which occasionally take place, will ad- 
mit that seedlings under any circumstances are far from satis- 
factory, and in the present instance I find no points of corre- 
spondence between the authentic specimens of dumetorum^ and 
their supposed descendants. I quote Sir James’ observation on 
the subject. “ Mr. Henry Shepherd, of the Botanic Garden, 
Liverpool, raised the A. dumetorum in plenty from seed brushed 
from a Derbyshire specimen. The individuals, whether culti- 
vated in pots or on rock-work, retain their original habit and 
characters, the largest not exceeding a foot in height.” ^ 

It fortunately happens that the very specimens here mentioned 
are also preserved in the Smithian herbarium, and the following 
note is gummed on the folio immediately below them. 

“ 1. Aspidium. — This I raised from seed brushed from the 
small frond which you sent me from Derbyshire, on your return 
home from Liverpool. You thought it might be a new one. It 
certainly differs from any British one that I am acquainted with, 
and appears to keep to the original, as we have it both in pots 
and on the rock, and there is no difference in either of the plants, 
these two fronds are as large as any the plant has produced, and 
it does not appear as it would grow much larger. H. Shepherd,” 

The specimens in question are not referrible to Lastrcea re- 
curva in any of its states, neither do they correspond with the 
plant which was subsequently recognized by Mr. Moore and 
myself at Liverpool as identical with that I am now describing ; 
but I may add that they a good deal resemble some seedlings I 
possess of L. ( multiflora J collina. 

When I first saw this beautiful fern in the North of Ireland, I 
was in company with Mr. William Bennett, and I instantly pro- 
nounced it a species new to Britain. I traced it in many of the 


* Eng. Flor. iv. 282 . 


234

Irish counties with the same feeling of certainty ; and it was 
only in deference to the judgment of three distinguished bota- 
nists, the late Professor Don, Mr. Moore of Dublin, and Mr. 
Babington of Cambridge, that I at last abandoned my opinion, 
and consented to give the species as a variety of dilatata. Pro- 
fessor Don, although he had frequent opportunities of consulting 
my somewhat ample materials on the subject, never in any de- 
gree wavered from his first opinion ; and Mr. Moore and Mr. 
Babington, who have enjoyed the best possible opportunities of 
forming an accurate decision, having seen it growing in all states 
and in an infinite variety of stations, still consider it a mere form 
of Last, dilatata. The testimony of Sir W. Hooker I have al- 
ready adduced. In adding another species to our list of British 
ferns, I think it but a matter of justice to my readers to show 
that I stand opposed to four of our most distinguished botanists. 
On the other hand, it is no little consolation that I am able to 
announce the judgment of Messrs. Bree, Borrer and Jenner, as 
corresponding with my own. 

The fronds, on first rising from the earth, are regularly con- 
volute, and when they exhibit the first symptoms of unfolding, 
the two lower pinnae are very conspicuous, and their superior 
size is still more manifest than at a later period. When the 
frond is entirely unfolded, it is of an elongate triangular form, 
of a very gracefully curved habit, and about equal in length 
to the stem, which is clothed with narrow, elongate, laciniated, 
toothed, brown, concolorous scales, which, in luxuriant plants, 
are frequently so numerous and so divided as to give the stem a 
woolly appearance : one of these scales is shown in the right-hand 
figure at page 214. The stem itself is dark purple in colour, 
and very hard and woody in texture. The frond is pinnate, and, 
as in Poly podium Pryopteris, P. calcar eum, Cystopteris mon- 
tana, and all truly deltoid ferns, the lower pinnae are vastly 
superior to the rest in size, and very distinctly stalked. The 
pinnae are pinnate, the pinnules pinnate, and the lobes again 
divided and serrated, and all the serratures terminate in short 
spines. The inferior pinnules are generally larger than the su- 
perior, and the first inferior pinnule of the lower pair of pinnae 
is vastly superior to all the rest in magnitude. The calour of

‘235 


the frond is a most lovely green, and its every division is par- 
tially concave, giving to the plant, especially when young and 
barren, a very peculiar and crisped appearance. 

I am indebted to the Honorable W. H. Dawnay for pointing 
out to me that the fronds of this fern are covered with minute, 
nearly globular, whitish, sessile, glandular bodies, and these 
probably emit the very obvious scent by which this fern may be 
readily distinguished from those with which it has generally been 
confounded. Mr. Dawnay found the plant near Redruth in 
Cornwall, and was struck by its difference, particularly in colour, 
from the species last described, without being aware that Mr. 
Bree had announced it as a distinct species. 

The clusters of capsules are circular, and are equally distri- 
buted over all the frond ; they are partially covered by a slightly 
convex, reniform, and generally lead-coloured involucre, the 
margins of which are jagged and uneven, and more or less beset 
with very minute, globular, sessile glands, similar to those on 
the frond : this character w^as first pointed out to me by Mr. 
Jenner, when we were examining the living plants at Eridge 
rocks ; and I am indebted to that gentleman for much kind as- 
sistance in my endeavours clearly to distinguish this species 
from its congeners. One of these involucres is shown in the 
right-hand figure on the following page. 

A word remains to be said respecting the name. When in 
Ireland I spoke of the plant to Mr. Moore by the name of con- 
cavum, which I merely gave it as a provisional appellation, until 
we could find out some further particulars concerning it : this, 
coupled with the fact that Mr. Babington has mentioned the 
plant as a well-marked variety, probably led to the supposition 
that he proposed the name, which he himself assures me he has 
nowhere done ; if therefore the name be hereafter remembered 
at all, it must be as an unpublished synonym, thus : — Lastrcea 
recurva — Aspidiiim recurvum^ Bree, and Lastrcea concava^ 
Newman, MS. I may perhaps be pardoned for adding that the 
word recurva does not convey to me an idea of the concavity 
of pinnules, for which the plant is particularly remarkable. 

Contrasted with cognate species, this fern may be known by 
its triangular instead of linear or lanceolate frond, by its first

pair of pinnae being much longer instead of shorter than the 
second, by these being much more distinctly stalked, by the 

very great length of the first in- 
ferior pinnule of its first pinnae : 
the absence of stalked glands 
distinguish it from multijlora, 
the presence of sessile glands 
from spinosa, and the long, li- 
near, laciniated scales of the 
stem distinguish it from both. 
In addition to these, Mr. Yar- 
rell, author of the admirable 
Histories of our British Fishes 
and Birds, has pointed out to me 
another character of this elegant 
plant, namely, the rapidity with 
which it withers after being ga- 
thered. While fronds of L. mul- 
tiflora retain their life and na- 
tural freshness for some hours, 
those of the present species fade 
in a much shorter time ; in this respect being almost equally 
evanescent with the species of Athyrium and Cystopteris.

This fern seems to claim precedence in beauty over every 
other British species. The exquisite grace of its habit, the ele- 
gance of its cutting, and the brilliant delicacy of its colour, 
combine to render it an object of general admiration. Tt may, 
perhaps, require some knowledge of kindred species fully to un- 
derstand the peculiarities which unite in giving to this fern its 
superiority over the rest, but dull indeed must be the perception 
and cold the heart that fails to appreciate its excessive loveliness. 

The Lady Fern is distributed more or less abundantly through- 
out the British islands, its favorite resort being moist and warm 
woods ; but it does not shrink from the exposure of open moors 
and naked hill-sides, and if sheltered by masses of weather-worn 
rock, its delicate fronds may often be found developing their fra- 
gile pinnules near the summits of the loftiest peaks of our Scottish 
Highlands. In Ireland it is more abundant although less beau- 
tiful than in England : it abounds on all the bogs, and is used 
as packing for fish and fruit, as we see the Common Brakes 
employed in this country. On landing at Warren-point, near 
Newry, I was rather surprised to see what quantities of it were 
employed in packing the herrings there exhibited for sale. 

All the forms found in Britain occur in every country of Eu- 
rope ; and others, very similar, have been found in Africa, Asia, 
Australia, and the United States of North America. From the 
last-mentioned country my kind correspondents have sent me 
three supposed species ; but whether these are really distinct 
from ours, and from each other, I can scarcely venture to pro- 
nounce, more especially as the question of species and varieties 
among our own forms of this fern, is at present undecided. 

I have felt so great difficulty in giving by a figure any satis- 
factory idea of the beauty of this species, that I refrain from any 
comment on the failures of its other depictors. 

The genus of this fern has been made a source of unnecessary 
trouble and confusion to botanists. Although the accurate Roth 


LADY FERN. 


239 


constituted his genus Athyrium for its reception, yet our three 
most eminent British botanists have disregarded his labours. 
Smith places it in Aspidium ; * Hooker in Asplenium ; f and 
Brown instituted his genus Allantodia for the reception of spe- 
cies scarcely distinguishable from ours. The genus may readily 
be distinguished by the elongate and somewhat sausage-shaped 
clusters of capsules, the attachment of which, together with that 
of the involucre which covers them, describes a concave rather 
than a direct line as in Asplenium^ and the anterior or free mar- 
gin of the involucre is slightly incurved. From Lastrcea this 
genus differs in having the clusters of capsules linear instead of 
circular, attached to the side instead of the back of the vein, and 
the involucre which covers them attached longitudinally instead 
of transversely on the vein. Its discrepancy from the genus 
Aspidium^ as now restricted to a group of ferns possessed of a 
distinguishing character common to them all, need scarcely 
be pointed out, since we have no European representative of 
the genus. 

The root is black, fibrous, and v/iry. The rhizoma is very 
large and vertically elongate, sometimes rising several inches 
above the surface of the ground ; in one instance I have seen it 
more than a foot in height, thus evincing a considerable proxi- 
mity to the tree ferns of tropical countries. Mr. Ball of Dublin 
showed me a plant of Filix-femina in a Wardian case, in which 
this peculiarity was very remarkable. 

The fronds make their appearance in May ; at first their ver- 
nation is circinate, but as they advance the apex becomes free, 
and hangs down as in Filix-mas, assuming the appearance of a 
shepherd’s crook : the form of the frond is lanceolate and regu- 
larly pinnate, the pinnules are simply toothed, pinnatifid or re- 
gularly pinnate. The naked portion of the stem varies from 
a quarter to a third of the entire length of the frond : it has 
numerous elongate blackish scales, which are particularly abun- 
dant at the base, and more scattered, smaller and scarcely ob- 
servable on the superior part : the stem is very much swollen at 
the base.

ASPLENIACE^. 


The midvein of the pinnules is waved, the lateral veins are 
forked shortly after leaving the midvein, and the anterior branch 
of each bears on its side, about midway between the midvein and 
margin, a linear cluster of capsules, as already described : the 
anterior free edge of the involucre is split into a series of capil- 
lary segments. The frond is extremely tender and fragile, and 
withers almost immediately on being gathered. 

The forms of this fern are so well marked and distinct, that 
some of the best continental botanists have not hesitated to give 
them as distinct species. i 

Linneus considered them as constituting two species : — Po- 
lypodium rhcBticumy which he described as having bipinnate 
fronds, with the leaflets and pinnaB remote and lanceolate, and 
their serratures acuminate ; ” * and Polypodium Filix-femina, 
“with bipinnate fronds, and acute, pinnatifid and lanceolate pin- 
nules.” t Whatever we may have heard in praise of the Lin- 
nean characters, I confess that to me they are very often far from 
satisfactory, and the only inference to be drawn from those I 
have now quoted, coupled with the existence of authentic re- 
presentatives of each species in the Linnean herbarium, is this : 
that Linneus regarded as two species that family (so to speak) 
of ferns, which in Britain, as well as on the continent, we usu- 
ally designate by the name of Filix-femina. 

To these Schreber added a third, under the name of Polypo- 
dium molle, which is described as having the fronds sub-bipin- 
nate, the pinnules lanceolate, somewhat obtuse and crenulate at 
the apex.J This form, as well as some of the others, is describ- 
ed by Weiss, but only as a variety of Filix-femina. And the 
enquiry, even restricted to those authors who treat the forms as 
species, is sufficiently voluminous without any reference to others 
who have considered them varieties.

These descriptions, like those of Linneus, are deficient in de- ’ 
tail, and we shall scarcely be able to employ them in distin- 
guishing ferns among which so close a similarity prevails. 

In 1800 Roth published the third volume of his ^ Flora Ger- 
manica,’ and in this we not only find Hoffmann’s views as to the 
separation of the various forms of Filix-femina fully adopted, 
but the forms themselves carefully and elaborately described. 
Hoffmann’s nomenclature is however only partially adopted.

Thinking that some of my readers might consider the whole 
of Roth’s descriptions and observations somewhat tedious, I 
have reserved them for the Appendix,*^ restricting my remarks, 
in this place, to a brief summary of the principal characters of 
each form, and treating each as a variety rather than a species. 
The reader who wishes to pursue the subject will do well to 
study Roth’s more elaborate descriptions. 

Athyrium Filix-femina, var. molle. (See figure a, page 244). 

Athyrium molle, Roth. 

Stalk short, with broad and short scales. Frond usually about 
eighteen inches in length, semi-erect, bright green, ovate-lanceo- 
late, pinnate, pinnm pinnate, their midrib winged, the lower pair 
distant from the rest, short, deltoid and deflexed ; pinnules flat, 
decurrent, united by wing of midrib, their margins toothed : the 
clusters of capsules are very distinct, there are 5 — 7 pairs on a 
pinna. 

Athyrium Filix-femina, var. trijidum. 

Athyrium trijidum, Roth. 

This much resembles the last, but is considerably larger, being 
twice as long and twice as wide ; the pinnules are flat and semi- 
decurrent, not being quite united by a wing of the mid-rib ; a 
slender wing is observable behind each pinnule at its base, but 
this does not reach to the base of the next following pinnule ; 
the pinnules are more deeply cut, and the apices of the lobes are 
generally distinctly trifid, the first anterior lobe of each pinnule is 
larger than the rest. The clusters of capsules, as compared with 
those of A. molle, are smaller and more remote.

Athyrium Filix-femina^ var. dentatumJ^ 

Athyrium ovatum, Roth. 

This plant seems intermediate between the two which precede 
it ; in habit and size it resembles A. molley but in the structure 
of the lobes, A. trijidum. From A. molle it differs in being more 
rigid, denser, darker in colour, and in having more scales scat- 
tered over the ribs : in the pinnules being more ovate and more 
deeply divided, in the lobes being larger and more diverging, the 
lower ones are dentate at the margin and trifid at the apex, the 
upper ones bifid at the apex, all of them are truncated. It will 
be observed that this combines two of Hoffmann’s species, but 
Roth says they scarcely differ from each other. 

Athyrium Filix-femina, var. incisum.\ (See figure h, p. 244). 
Athyrium Filix-femma, Roth. 

The fronds of this plant often attain a length of four and some- 
times five feet, and a breadth of eighteen inches ; its rhizoma 
grows to an immense size, and when perfectly undisturbed for 
many years in a favorable situation, rises above the surface of the 
ground, and throws up a most striking and beautiful head of 
fronds, often thirty or forty in number. The colour, however, 
in comparison with that of A. molle, is much less bright, and in- 
deed is often a dull and obscure green : the pinnae are very broad, 
and those in the middle of the frond are often nine inches long: 
the pinnules are very distinct from each other, and almost, or in 
some cases quite, pinnate, the lobes being flat, diverging, and 
sharply toothed; the divisions of the frond being so much more 
numerous than in A. molle, the clusters of capsules are multipli- 
ed in proportion, so that instead of presenting a bilinear series, 
as in that plant, they appear thickly but irregularly scattered over 
the frond. Roth describes a variety of this plant, distinguished 
by its smaller size, its narrower and linear-lanceolate pinnules ; 
and this he supposes to be Hoffmann’s Polypodium incisum. I 
scarcely entertain a doubt that Hoffmann intended to include 
both the larger and smaller plants, the differences being quite 
insufficient to distinguish between them. 

* In this instance I adopt Hoffmann’s name, as having the claim of priority, 
f In this instance I adopt Hoffmann’s name, because the name Filix-femina 
being employed for the species will not also serve for the variety.

Athyrium rh(Bticu7n, Roth. 

Stalk scarcely a third as long as the frond, and clothed with 
a few long brown scales : fronds of moderate size, semi-erect, 
pale yellowish green, linear, pinnate ; pinnae distant, pinnate, 
midrib not winged; pinnules linear, very narrow, distant, convo- 
lute, the edges folding over the clusters of capsules, instead of 
being flat and spreading as in the forms previously described ; 
their margins are notched rather than toothed, and the divisions 
from their convexity appear rounded, 
the clusters of capsules are densely 
crowded, and when mature become con- 
fluent, covering the entire under side of 
each pinnule. Roth describes a seedling 
of this species under the name of var. 
minus y of which the fronds are less than 
a foot in length and of a brighter green 
colour, the pinnules are more deflexed 
and still more convolute, and the clus- 
ters of capsules, even in the mature 
state, are less confluent. 

Smith has described this seedling or 
starved variety under the name of Aspid, 
irriguum; why he has done so without 
alluding to Roth’s invaluable volume, 
which, from the frequently recurring 
quotations, evidently lay open before 
him, is one of those botanical mysteries 
which often perplex the enquirer, yet so 
it is. His description of Roth’s Athy- 
rium rhddticUmy var. minus y under its al- a. rhsetlcum, var. mmus, [Roth). 

tered generic and specific names, is in these words.

jagged. * ^ Scarcely one fourth so large as the pre- 

ceding, of which nevertheless some good botanists have thought 
it a variety, and indeed, after long cultivation, though raised ori- 
ginally from seed, it considerably approaches that species. In 
a wild state the fronds are of a more narrow lanceolate figure, 
and of a paler pellucid green, the main stalk occasionally scaly, 
but in general quite smooth and exactly quadrangular, though 
the latter circumstance varies. Leaflets shorter and somewhat 
less linear than in Filix-femincij deeply serrated or partly pin- 
natifid, their segments sharply cut without bristly points. Mass- 
es by the side of the midrib of a few of the lowermost lobes of 
each leaflet, solitary, oblong, though short and ultimately round- 
ish or oval. Cover at first oblong, soon becoming kidney-shaped 
or almost orbicular with a lateral notch, flat, thin, membranous 
and jagged. Capsules dark brown.” ^ Mr. Cameron, of the 
Botanic Garden at Birmingham, has observed that this plant in 
cultivation becomes the convex form of Filix-femina \ and my 
own experiments confirm his observations. 

The late Mr. David Don, in a paper published in the ^Trans- 
actions of the Linnean Society of London,’ and which I have 
previously had occasion to quote, writes thus on the forms of Fi- 
lix-femina, ‘‘There are two very marked varieties of this plant; 
the one with broader segments, of a dark green, with the stipes 
and rachis of a pale purple hue ; the other, and that the com- 
monest, with the segments of a more delicate texture, and the 
whole frond of a pale green. The latter variety varies much. in 
size, according to soil and situation ; in damp shady places it 
becomes the Filix-foemina of ‘ English Botany,’ and in more 
open exposed situations, the irrigumn ; but neither of these 
states is entitled to be regarded as a distinct form. A specimen 
of the larger variety in the Linnaean herbarium, is marked Foly- 
podium rlixticum^ and with the usual mark of authenticity at- 
tached to the specimen.” f The first of these forms is the var. 
incisiim, the second the var. convexum, of the foregoing list. 

‘The Naturalists’ Almanack’ adopts, with a mark expressive 
of uncertainty, three of Roth’s species, — molle^ Filix-femina^ 

 *Eng\ Flor. iv. 283. f Trans. Linn. Soc.-xvii. 436. 


LADY FERN. 


247 


and 7'h(Eticum^ omitting trifidum and ovatum, which indeed ap- 
pear much to resemble molle. 

By retaining all these forms under the name of Filix-femina^ 
in accordance with the views of Decandolle, Sadler, Hooker 
and Babington, I rather bow to the views of these eminent 
botanists than follow any of my own. It seems to me that three 
at least of the forms described by Roth, those adopted in the ‘Na- 
turalists’ Almanack,’ have the habit and appearance of species ; 
but at the same time I cannot say that the grounds of separation 
adduced by Roth appear to me satisfactory : neither the scales, 
involucres, nor position of the clusters of capsules, are adduced 
as evidence ; and surely, before adopting the species, we must 
learn whether these are dissimilar or identical. Roth is entitled 
to great praise for what he has done, but it is left for others to 
earn still greater praise by adducing real diagnostics to corro- 
borate his views. 

I am indebted to Miss Beever of Coniston, Miss Browne of 
Tallantire-hall near Cockermouth, Mr. Thompson of Belfast, 
Mr. Ogilby and Mr. Moore of Dublin, Mr. Gibson of Hebden 
Bridge, and Mr. H. Double day of Epping, for a great number 
of fronds from a variety of localities. 

For monstrous or deformed states of plants I have little or no 
taste ; yet there are two monstrosities of the present plant, which, 
from the remarkable character and the remarkable constancy 
of that character, should scarcely be passed over in silence. 
The first of these was found atTrevenna in Cornwall, by the late 
Rev. R. F. Bree, and I am indebted to Mr. Borrer for a frond 
from his own fernery : the divisions are irregular, but always very 
narrow and linear. The second, of which I have introduced a 
figure in the following page, is very beautiful : it occurs in se- 
veral places in Ireland. I am indebted to Mr. Ogilby, Mr. Mac- 
kay and Mr. Moore for specimens ; and I have in cultivation a 
plant nearly resembling it, which was found by Mr. Moore and 
myself in the county Wicklow. In cultivation both these forms 
retain all their peculiarities in the same way as the beautiful va- 
rieties of Polypodiwn vulgare, a fact w^hich sufficiently proves 
the necessity for care in drawing inferences as regards the value 
of species from their constancy under cultivation.

HUDSON’S SPLEEN WORT, [one-fourth the natural size), 
Asplenium lanceolate m, Hudson. 

This is a very local fern, and, although not exclusively con- 
fined to the sea-shores, must be considered chiefly a maritime 
species, for, with the exception of the stations in the vicinity of 
Tunbridge Wells and Snowdon, it has never been found, as far 
as my information extends, at any considerable distance from 
the sea. I have recorded below all the localities of this fern 
which have come to my knowledge : three others, — in Oxford- 
shire, Shropshire and Yorkshire, have been recorded, but I 
think it preferable to omit these, since I believe they have never 
been verified by a second observer, and were published at a time 
when the species was very imperfectly known. 

Caernarvonshire. — -I found it at two stations in this county ; 
the first on some rocks on the right hand of the road between 
Tan-y-bwlch and Aberglaslyn, and the second on a rock close 
to Aberglaslyn. . Mr. S. Thompson, guided by my record of

these localities, subsequently found lialf-a-dozen roots in the 
first of them. Mr. Wilson informs me that in 1843 he gathered 
a few fronds of this fern, near my Llanrwst station for A. septen- 
trionale, and that it was first observed there by his brother, Mr. 
H. Wilson, two years previously. 

Cornwall. — I am indebted to Mr. Greenwood for some fine 
specimens gathered near Penzance. Mr. Ralfs informs me it is 
common in many places near Penzance and St. Ives. Mr. 
Watson gives me the former of these localities. Mr. D. Peir- 
son informs me he has found it at the Manacles, the Logan 
rock, &c. 

Devonshire. — The Rev. W. S. Hore has obligingly sent me 
specimens, accompanied by the following habitats : — Morwell 
rocks, on the banks of the Tamar ; rocks on the Tavy, opposite 
Virtuous Lady mine ; rocks near Cann quarry, on the banks of 
the Plym ; and on a damp mud wall at Buckland Monachorum. 
In addition to some of these localities, Mr. Ralfs informs me he 
has found it near Tavistock, and by the sea at Salcombe. I am 
indebted to Miss Griffiths and Mr. Bey non for specimens from 
Torquay, where it seems first to have been observed by Mr. 
Beynon in 1842, deeply seated in the interstices of a stone wall 
— of loose, open construction, and having a southerly aspect — - 
not far above high-water-mark, near the mouth of a small brook 
about half-a-mile from the town. 

Gloucestershire. — Mr. Lees informs me he found it on a 
wall at Beechly, near the junction of the Severn and the Wye : 
Oldbury and Court woods have been published as stations ; Mr. 
Watson adds Pennant rocks near Stapleton, on the authority of 
Mr. Thwaites ; and Mr. Thwaites himself has published the 
following note in ‘ The Phytologist.’ — - Mr. J. W. Ewing, of 
Norwich, who resided here for some time a few years ago, dis- 
covered the plant growing on a bank at Stapleton, about three 
miles from Bristol, and pointed out the spot to me. Not paying- 
much attention to the ferns at that time, the circumstance es- 
caped from my memory, until reminded of it by a friend who 
was with us at the time. I have recently revisited the spot and 
again found the plant, but growing there very sparingly ; how- 
ever, by searching very diligently, day after day, the rocks in 


Hudson’s spleenwort.

the immediate neighbourhood, I discovered it in one or two 
other places, and in one of these abundantly, covering the dry 
surface of a rock completely sheltered from rain, and, though 
its roots are almost exposed and a slight pull detaches it from 
the rock, it grows in the greatest luxuriance, one frond which I 
gathered measuring eighteen inches in length. I have observed 
in all the fronds of this fern which I have gathered, that the 
rachis is throughout its entire length furnished with linear scales, 
a character which best distinguishes it in all its forms, and even 
in its very young state, from Asplenium Adiantum-mgrumr^ 
I am indebted to the Botanical Society of London for a very 
beautiful series of specimens collected by Mr. Thwaites in this 
locality, and Mr. Thwaites has most obligingly sent me his own 
magnificent specimens for inspection. 

Kent. — I am indebted to Mr. E. Jenner for specimens from 
rocks facing the High rocks near Tunbridge Wells, and, con- 
ducted by that gentleman, 1 had the pleasure of seeing it still 
growing there in August, 1843. 

Merionethshire. — The vicinity of Barmouth seems a very 
favorite locality for this fern. Before I was at all acquainted 
with ferns, I found it in profusion on an old stone wall between 
Barmouth and Dolgelly, and was struck with its similarity to, 
yet distinctness from, Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum, I afterwards 
found it in many localities near Barmouth, particularly on rocks 
close to the road, on the left on leaving the town for Dolgelly. 

Pembrokeshire. — Mr. Lees informs me he found it on Ram- 
say Island, opposite St. David’s, on rocks a little south of the 
only habitation on the island. 

Sussex. — I am indebted to Mr. S. L. Howard for a specimen 
found on the High rocks, Tunbridge Wells, and to Mr. E. Jen- 
ner for others from the same station : under the guidance of 
the last-named gentleman, I had the pleasure of seeing it grow- 
ing here in August, 1843. Mr. Borrer and Mr. Jenner have 
also observed it on rocks in Eridge-park. 

Its European range is very limited. Sadler gives it as a na- 
tive of France, but it does not appear in the ^ Flore Fran^aise,’

which seems remarkable, since Mr. H. Doubleday informs me it 
is very plentiful on walls and banks in the Channel Islands. 
He slept on the island of Serk, in a little stone cottage, covered 
with Asplenium lance olatum, Adiantum-nigrwn and Tricho- 
manes. Mr. Watson informs me he found it in Fayal, one of 
the Azores, and that Dr. Lemann collected it in Madeira. 

The only tolerable figure of this fern with which I am ac- 
quainted is in Gerarde’s Herbal : ^ that in Sowerby’s ^ English 
Botany ’ f is more like Asplenium fontanum ; and that in Mr. 
Francis’s ‘ Analysis of British Ferns rather resembles C?/5- 
topteris fragilis than the present plant. I do not know Bolton’s 
figure § referred to by Withering. 

It is one of those species which has fortunately escaped all 
confusion in nomenclature : we are indebted to Hudson || for 
describing and naming it as a distinct species, and I believe all 
subsequent anthors have adopted his name. It must, however, be 
observed that our plant is not the Asplenium lanceolatum of Hoff- 
mann,1[ an error judiciously pointed out by Weber and Mohr,^^ 
that plant being nothing more than a variety of Asplenium Adi- 
antum-nigrum. These authors also correctly observe that Asp. 
lanceolatum has never been found in Germany. It appears that 
our plant was well known to Bay, who describes it as Filix 
elegans Adianto nigro accedens, segmentis rotundiorihusr ft 
The only habitats he gives are, first, on the authority of Sherard, 
‘‘ rocks on the north side of the Isle of Jersey,” and secondly, 
on the authority of Bobart, the porch of Adderbury church 
in Oxfordshire : ” he also adds that it has been found in Eng- 
land by Mr. Woodward, but gives no more precise information. 
The Adderbury church habitat I have thought better to omit, 
supposing that Adi'antum-nigrum was the plant observed.

The roots are black, very long, slender and penetrating ; in 
the fissures of rocks they often run to a great depth, and the 
plant becomes so completely and firmly wedged that it is a 
task of great difficulty to obtain a living plant from such situ- 
ations. The rhizoma is brown, tufted, and densely covered with 
bristle-like scales ; similar scales are also scattered here and there 
on the stem. The young fronds make their appearance in May, 
arrive at maturity in August, and remain uninjured throughout 
the winter ; except in seedling plants they are always fertile. 
The form of the frond is various ; in some situations it is of 
erect growth, nearly linear and simply pinnafe, the pinnae being 
stalked and lobed : in this state seed is abundantly produced, 
and the masses when full grown are perfectly circular. Of the 
three entire fronds represented in the illustration at page 249, 
that to the right-hand is intended for this variety, and the por- 
tions of fronds to the right and left show the situation of the 
veins, and the mode of fructification ; every part of the plant is 
perfectly flat, and the entire plant rigid. A second variety, of 
pendant growth and larger size, is lanceolate in form : the pin- 
nae are pinnate ; the pinnules stalked, serrated, and somewhat 
quadrate. The fronds often measure a foot in length, and some- 
times fifteen and even eighteen inches ; they usually issue from 
dark holes or crevices, or depend from the roofs of sea-caves ; 
and the lower pair of pinnae are often bleached, of small size, 
weak and imperfect : the surface of the frond is generally flat : 
the middle frond of the three represents this form, and the de- 
tached pinnule immediately adjoining it shows the veins and 
incipient involucres. A third variety is of nearly erect growth, 
but bends over at the extremity ; and the entire frond, together 
with each individual pinnule, possesses such a rigid and inflex- 
ible convexity, that it is next to impossible to flatten it by pres- 
sure : the frond to the left is intended to represent this variety, 
but the convexity is not expressed. 

The lateral veins are branched, a branch running to the ex- 
treipity of each serrature ; the clusters of capsules are attached 
near the extremity of the veins, and somewhat alternately, one 
branch bearing a mass and the next being without one : each 
cluster is at first elongate and linear, and covered by a linear, 


254 


ASPLENIACE^. 


white involucre ; this involucre soon disappears, and the clus- 
ters generally become nearly circular and somewhat crowded ; 
they are sometimes so large and crowded when ripe as to be 
quite confluent. 

Contrasted with the ubiquitous species which I shall next 
describe, Asplenium lanceolatum may be known by the relative 
length of the lower pairs of pinnae : in lanceolatum the first 
pair is often shorter than the second, third and fourth, but this, 
as pointed out to me by Miss Griffiths, is far from being univer- 
sally the case, still they are not longer, the first to the fourth 
pair inclusive being nearly of equal length and size ; in Adian- 
tum-nigrum, on the contrary, the first pair of pinnae are mani- 
festly the longest, and the remainder gradually decrease in 
length, the form of the frond being deltoid : in lanceolatum the 
pinnae are somewhat in pairs, although, strictly speaking, not 
opposite ; in Adianturn-nigrum they are uniformly alternate : 
in lanceolatum they are set on at nearly right angles with the 
main stem ; in Adianturn-nigrum they form an acute angle with 
the stem ; in lanceolatum the pinnules are rounder and blunter 
than in Adianturn-nigrum^ a character which, as we have seen, 
attracted the notice of the all-observing Kay : the situation of 
the capsules on the lateral veins is also different, being in lan- 
ceolatum much nearer its extremity than in Adianturn-nigrum.

Asplenium Amantum-nigrum, Linneus. 

The Black Spleenwort is universally distributed throughout 
the United Kingdom, but in some districts far more abundantly 
than in others : it occurs on rocks as a native habitat, but seems 
gladly to avail itself of walls, old buildings, ruins and hedge- 
rows : on ruins it is often very ornamental. 

It has been found in every country of Europe, wdth the excep- 
tion of Spain; and the form subsequently noticed under the 
name acutum is of frequent occurrence in Africa, Madeira and 
Teneritfe. A species very similar to the common English form 
of this plant has been discovered in the United States, but is of 
such great rarity that the opportunity of forming an opinion on 
the subject, from a careful comparison of a sufficient number of 
specimens, has not yet been afforded me. In the absence of 
such materials I may cite the opinion of Dr. Torrey, who, as 
Mr. Boott informs me, considers it a distinct species : the plant 


256 


ASPLENIACE.E. 


to which I allude is described by Beck under the name of As- 
plenium montanum^ and by Michaux under that of Asplenium 
Adiantum-nigrwm.\ 

There are good figures of this fern in Sowerby’s ^ English 
Botany,’ X Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’ § and in many of the continental 
works. 

Concerning the nomenclature of this fern there appears no 
difference of opinion, the name of Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum 
being assigned to it by general consent. 

Its medicinal properties have been celebrated by several of 
the older writers, but little credence appears to have been given 
to them by modern practitioners : the catalogue of diseases in 
w^hich it was prescribed is summed up by Ray in the passage

The root is very black and wiry ; the rhizoma tufted, black, 
and covered with bristly scales : the stem is extremely smooth, 
shining, and generally of a black or dark purple colour ; at its 
base are a few scattered scales. 

The fronds seldom appear before the end of May or begin- 
ning of June : at first their position is nearly erect, but they soon 
begin to droop, and finally become quite pendulous : they arrive 
at maturity in September, and continue perfectly green and vi- 
gorous throughout the winter, and until the ensuing May, or 
even June ; they are always fertile. The form of the frond is 
triangular, its apex being acute and attenuated ; it is pinnate ; 
the pinnae are triangular, acutely pointed, pinnate and alternate ; 
the pinnules again are alternate and triangular, and the lower 
ones often pinnate or pinnatifid, with the lobes notched. 

The lateral veins in the pinnules or lobes, as the case may be, 
are irregularly alternate, and are generally forked after leaving 
the midvein ; and one or both branches of this divided vein 
bears on its side a line of capsules : these are at first covered by

a white, linear, narrow, scale-like involucre, also attached to the 
side of the veins : the clusters of capsules, together with their 
involucres, are situated rather nearer the midvein than the mar- 
gin, a character in which they differ from those of the species 
last described : the involucres open towards the midvein. As 
the capsules advance towards maturity, the involucre is lifted 
up and pushed away from its original situation, and finally it 
entirely disappears ; the form of the cluster of capsules is then 
lost, and, in very fruitful examples, the clusters become con- 
fluent, and nearly cover the underside of the frond.

stem, thus giving to the frond its acutely deltoid form, — and 
lastly, the different situation of the pinnules, — are characters 
which readily distinguish the present from the last species. 

There are three very marked forms of this fern. I have drawn 
the lowest pinnule of each of these exactly of the natural size, 
in order to afford a better opportunity for examining and con- 
trasting their characters. Whatever may be the true value of 
these forms, whether they be more correctly described as species 
or varieties, I will not attempt to say ; but I trust I am correct 
in saying that the distinguishing characters hitherto published 
are scarcely sufficient for the establishment of the former : I 
therefore adopt the same plan as in Filix-femina, and treat 
them for the present as varieties only.

This form of the plant appears to be the Filix pumila petrcea 
nostras of Plukenet, as quoted by Dillenius in the third edition 
of Ray’s ‘ Synopsis ; ’ ^ and the Asplenium ohtusum of Willde- 
now’s ‘ Species Plantarum,’t and of Sadler’s work on the Ferns 
of Hungary.! Concerning the plants of these three authors I am 
compelled, however, to acknowledge that my means of judging 
are very imperfect, and I have given in the Appendix§ the whole 
of Sadler’s descriptions and references, not only as regards the 
present, but also the following forms. The name of ohtusum 
seems to have been given in Kitaibel’s MS. work on the Ferns 
of Hungary, now in the library of the Hungarian Museum of 
Natural History. The principal characters appear to exist in 
the winged stem, smaller size, blunter divisions, and in the whole 
frond being much less divided. Sprengel considers it a variety 
of the next rather than of the present species.

and appears to me exactly intermediate between the two others. 
It is the Adiantum nigrum ojfficinarum, Common black Maiden-

guishing character to consist in the stem being not winged.^

Sprengel, Willdenow and Sadler, all of them give an Asple- 
nium a utmn, which I think must be identical with Ray’s Filix 
minor longifolia^-\ described from specimens found on the moun- 
tains of Mourn, in the county of Down, in Ireland. Dillenius, 
the editor of the edition of Ray’s ‘ Synopsis ’ from which my 
quotations are made, expresses a doubt as to its distinctness as 
a species, since no fructification had been observed, and suggests 
the possibility of its being a variety of Adiantum-nigrum, in- 
debted for its peculiarities to the fact of its growing in a cave into 
which the solar rays could not enter.J Smith, who makes it his 
var. /3. of Adiantum-nigrum, informs us that Sherard’s original 
specimen is preserved in the herbarium at Oxford, that it is truly 
elegant, of a delicate membranous texture, the leaflets palmate 
and finely laciniated, and that no fructification is discernible. § 
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mackay have found this variety at Killarney. 
“ I found,” says Mr. Mackay, ‘‘in 1805, on the limestone rocks at 
Mucruss, a beautiful and delicate variety [of Adiantum-nigrimi]^ 
with fronds tripinnate throughout, or with pinnules deeply and 
finely laciniated ; it was subsequently found by Miss Hutchins 
and Dr. Taylor, and Mr. W. Andrews lately gave me a specimen 
collected by him, in 1835, on a mountain called Cahir Conree, 
six miles from Tralee.” |1 I am indebted to Miss Carpenter, of 
Bristol, for an opportunity of seeing and carefully examining a 
specimen gathered near Cork ; the lowest pinna of the frond is

represented at page 257, figure c. This specimen was I believe 
gathered by Dr. Allmann, from whom I have received an inte^ 
resting note on the subject. “ There may be some doubt,” 
writes Dr. Allmann, as to the necessity of considering it sepa- 
rately from the common form of Adiantum-nigrum, for though 
the extreme forms are so remarkably distinct as to strike the 
most casual observer, yet these extremes are connected by such 
numerous gradations, by which they run into each other, that I 
believe it to be impossible to say where the more common variety 
terminates and the rarer one commences : the great elegance, 
however, of ivell-marked specimens of the rarer variety, and the 
facility with which they may be distinguished from the common 
form, seems to render a separate notice of the fern desirable.” 
Mr. Mackay, when recently in London, informed me that under 
cultivation he had found this plant return to the usual form. I 
entertain no doubt that the plant thus noticed by Ray, Dillenius, 
Smith and Mackay, and also by Miss Carpenter and Dr. All- 
mann, and of which a specimen is now before me, is identical 
with the Asplenium acutum of Bory, Sprengel, Willdenow and 
Sadler.

The Wall Rue, or Rue-leaved Spleen wort, is one of those

the swallow, and the martin, — seem to have deserted their native

wilds, and to have taken up their residence amongst the habita- 
tions of men. It is abundant on ruins and old churches, and has 
a strong predilection for brick walls, although Sir J. E. Smith 
makes Ray assert “ that it dies whenever it gets upon burnt 
bricks.”^' The original passage is Lateribus cociis immoritur 
Dillenius either used the verb immorior as Horace does in 
immoriiur studiis — “he is always at his books,” or he may 
have written immoratur — “it lives on brick walls,” thus point- 
ing out its favourite locality : so carefully observant a man 
as Dillenius must have frequently seen it flourishing in the 
crumbling mortar, filling the interstices of brick buildings : we 
need wander no further from London than the wall of Green- 
wich park, to see it flourishing abundantly on bricks. 

Throughout the northern, western, and southern counties of 
England, and also in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, this fern 
is to be found on almost every ruin, but, as regards England, 
far less abundantly in the eastern than in the western counties. 
In a perfectly wild state, it grows abundantly on the rocky hills 
in Scotland, particularly on Arthur’s seat, near Edinburgh ; in 
the Peak district of Derbyshire ; on Cader Idris, and Snowdon 
more sparingly. 

It is generally distributed over the continent of Europe, pre- 
ferring towns and buildings to the open country : I am indebted 
to Mr. Lea for specimens from the United States. 

Of our figures of this fern I cannot speak in high praise. Con- 
cerning its nomenclature no difference of opinion appears to 
have arisen. 

Lightfoot informs us that this plant was formerly sold as a 
pectoral, and recommended in coughs, asthmas, obstructions of 
the liver and spleen, and in scorbutic complaints.^ 

The roots of Asplenium Ruta-muraria are wiry and black ; 
the rhizoma is black, tufted, and clothed with bristly scales : the 
fronds make their appearance in May and June, arrive at matu- 
rity in September, and continue perfectly green throughout the 
winter, and until the ensuing May ; they are always fertile. 

The stem is black or dark purple, very smooth and shining.

and for more than half its length naked. The normal form of 
the frond is triangular and pinnate, the pinnae being alternate 
and also pinnate ; the pinnules are of varied form, but mostly 
somewhat lozenge-shaped ; they are stalked, and resemble so 
many little leaves ; their exterior margin is generally serrated 
or crenate. 

The veins radiate from the stalk to the exterior margin of the 
pinnule, and to them are attached the elongate lines of capsules, 
two, three, four, and even five on a pinnule ; these are at first 
covered by an elongate, linear, white involucre, the free margin 
of which generally faces the median line of the pinnule, and is 
jagged and uneven ; this is soon pushed aside by the swelling 
capsules, turned back, and finally lost, the back of the pinnule 
becoming eventually nearly covered by a dense, dark brown 
mass of seed.

Observation on Asplenium germa- 
nicum. - — The fronds from which the 
outlines in the margin were sketched 
led me to suppose that Asplenium 
german/icum was but a form of A. 
Ruta-muraria. Mr. Wilson tells me 
that this conclusion was drawn too 
hastily, and I gladly yield to so high 
an authority, more especially as Mr. 
Wilson’s opinion seems in unison 
with that expressed by nearly all the 
continental botanists. Truth should 
be the only object of the naturalist ; 
and when, in diligently seeking it 
with perfect singleness of purpose, 
his own judgment proves an insuffi- 
cient guide, it seems but reasonable 
that he should avail himself of the 
assistance kindly offered him by 
others, whose opportunities of obser- 
vation have been more extended, 
and whose ability to arrive at a just 
conclusion is greater than his own. 
The pleasure an author may be sup- 
posed to feel in making the catalogue 
of his country’s productions as full 
as possible, has also perhaps some 
little weight, but I am so fully aware 
that this propensity becomes dan- 
gerous when injudiciously indulged, 
that I endeavour as much as possible 
to resist its influence. The question 
of the exact value of differences has 
hitherto scarcely obtained sufficiently 
careful attention, but I doubt not 
the time will arrive when we shall 
be more united on this difficult point.

I quite understand Smith as saying he received it from Dickson. 

It appears to be nowhere common on the continent, but has . 
been found here and there on rocks and walls in Sweden, Hun- 
gary, Germany, France and Italy. Beyond the limits of Europe 
I am unable to trace its range. 

There is a beautiful figure of this fern in Jac quin’s ‘ Miscel- 
lany,’^ accompanied by a description by Wulfen ; those in Sow- 
erby’s ‘ English Botany ’ f and Mr. Francis’s ^ Analysis ’ are 
not so good. 

Concerning the name of this fern there appears a variety of 
opinions. It is the Asplenium germanicum of Weiss, published 
in his ‘ Plantae Cryptogamicae,’J in 1770, and adopted by Spren- 
gel, Willdenow, Hoffmann, Decandolle and Sadler, so that, be- 
sides having the claim of priority, this is the current name on 
the continent of Europe. It is the Asplenium alternifolium of 
Wulfen, published in Jacquin’s ‘ Miscellany,’ in 1781, as above 
cited, and adopted by Roth, Withering, Smith, Hooker, Francis 
and Babington. It is the Asplenium Breynii of Retz,§ pub- 
lished subsequently to 1772, but I cannot learn the exact date, 
and adopted by Weber and Mohr, and Swartz. Sir J. E. Smith, 
in justification of his adopting the later name of alternifolium, 
writes thus. — ‘‘The nomenclature of this species, a native not 
only of Germany, but of Switzerland, Sweden and Scotland, 
evinces the folly of specific names taken from any particular 
country, but more especially the still greater folly of restoring 
old names which had been laid aside on accoun t of their badness, 
and long since forgotten.” || I join with Hoffmann, Willdenow 
and Decandolle, in deserving this reproach, and adopt the name, 
as they do, supposing it to possess the claim of priority ; not that 
I constitute myself a judge of its quality. If authors generally 
held themselves justified in selecting names by their goodness 
or badness, we must bid a long farewell to all hopes of a 
uniform nomenclature : the very suggestion seems to me to be 
fraught with danger to the science.

I need not repeat my doubts as to Asplenium germanicum 
being a distinct species ; it is sufficient that so many excellent 
botanists have thought otherwise. I have much pleasure in 
quoting the following observations of the Rev. T. Bell on this 
subject. 

I am aware some botanists have remarked, that attenuated 
forms of Asplenium Ruta-muraria approach indefinitely near 
A. alternifolium. I believe the two species have occasionally 
been confounded, but I always regarded this as a mistake into 
which no one could fall who had perfect specimens before him, 
and who was not prepared to substitute the general aspect and 
habit of the plants for their specific characters. As Mr. New- 
man, in his recent publication on Ferns, has fallen into this 
mistake, and conjoined the species, I think it not out of place 
to communicate to the Botanical Society the following brief 
observations : — 

The first character is taken from the form of the frond, which 
is correctly stated by Sir William Hooker to be bipinnate in 
A. Ruta-muraria^ and, in alternifolium, pinnate, the lower pin- 
na ternate ; the pinnae in both being alternate. Now so far from 
its being the tendency of attenuated or contracted forms of A. 
Ruta-muraria to approach the pinnate form of alternifolium — 
the truth of the matter is, that the more attenuated the former 
is, the more distinctly bipinnate does it become, or in other 
w^ords, the nearer A. Ruta-muraria approaches alternifolium 
in its general aspect and habit, the further and more visibly does 
it diverge in this character. 

The second character is taken from the indusium, with re- 
gard to which it is hardly necessary to remark, that while that 
of alternifolium has a smooth even edge, the edge in all varie- 
ties of Ruta-muraria is invariably jagged or uneven, and this is 
quite visible to the naked eye.”* 

Without at all attempting to undervalue these observations, 
I would just observe that the peculiar form of frond had been 
previously well described in the Floras of France and Germany, 
and the character of the involucre pointed out by several authors. 


* Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 119, 


268 


ASPLENIACE^. 


In our own country I would cite Sir W. Hooker, who says, 
‘‘ Involucre entire,”* and Mr. Francis, who still more explicitly 
observes, “ Indusium entire on the margin.”f 

The roots are black and wiry ; the rhizoma rather elongate ; 
the stem dark at the base, but green above ; the frond very nar- 
row, linear and pinnate ; the pinnae regularly alternate, distant, 
ascending, somewhat pear-shaped, notched at the apex, and 
sometimes also at the side ; the united apical portion of the 
frond is generally larger and also more pointed than either of 
the pinnae ; the pinnae, as in the last species, are without a mid- 
vein ; they have two, three, or four sub-parallel, longitudinal 
veins, and on each of them is usually situated aline of capsules, 
which, as far as I have observed, is covered by a linear, some- 
what inflated and persistent involucre, which is slightly arched 
over the capsules, opens towards the median line of the pinna, 
and has a sinuous but not jagged free margin. 

The opinion of Linneus appears to have been in favour of 
combining the two forms : in order to exemplify this I shall 
quote an observation of M. Jacquin’s, which stands in his ‘ Mis- 
cellanea Austriaca,’ appended to Wulfen’s paper already cited, 
and which is entitled ‘ Plantaa rariores Carinthiacae.’ Alluding 
to A. germanicum^ there described as A. alternifolium^ he writes 
thus. — Plantulam hanc jam olim crescentem inveni in Austria, 
circa Glocknitz, in rupibus calcareis, etiam mixtim cum Acros- 
ticho septentrionali. Cum beatus Linneus, quocum communi- 
caverim, mordicus susiineret meram esse Rut<B murari<B varie- 
taterriy non ausus fui pro nova specie proponere, et omiseram in 
stirpium agri Viennensis enumeratione.”! From this passage it 
will, I think, appear, that if previously in error, I have at least 
the satisfaction of having erred in excellent company. I must 
not, however, be understood as considering Linneus unexcep- 
tionable authority on such a subject, since subsequent observa- 
tions have, in several instances, clearly proved that some of his 
species were far too comprehensive. 

This little fern appears to do well in cultivation ; the roots 
are probably obtained from Germany or the South of France.

Asplenium septentrionale, Hoffmann. 

This is one of the rarest of our British ferns : it occurs only 
in the fissures of rocks, and the interstices of stone walls : in 
the latter it appears to thrive more luxuriantly, probably from 
the frequently exposed situation and elevation of the former. 
I think I have seen specimens from nearly all the recorded sta- 
tions, and none of them are equal in luxuriance to those which 
I found by the farm-yard at Llanrwst, which, being on the 
Conway and not far from its mouth, is but slightly elevated 
above the level of the sea. At Llanrwst the tufts of this fern 
were very large : one of them was so heavy, that after shaking 
out all the loose earth, I found it a very inconvenient load to 
carry even the single mile which I had to convey it : this tuft, 
consisting I suppose of but one rhizoma, had upwards of 
three hundred perfectly vigorous fronds, besides at least an 
equal number of decaying ones, the relics of the previous year. 
Gerarde, who calls it Muscus corniculatus, says, “ there is found 
vpon the tops of our most barren mountaines, but especially 
where sea Coles are accustomed to be digged, stone to make 
iron of, and also where ore is gotten for tinne and lead, a 
certaine small plant : it riseth forth of the ground with many 
bare and naked branches, diuiding themselues at the top 
into sundry knags like the forked homes of a Deere, every 


270 


ASPLENIACE^, 


part whereof is of an overworne whitish colour.” ^ Modern 
botanists do not seem to have met with this fern in mining dis- 
tricts, but the hint is worth reviving. 

Besides the English and Welch localities given below, it 
is said by Jacob, in his ‘ Planta 0 Favershamienses,’ to grow on 
the north side of Bocton church, in Kent ; but I quite agree 
with the authors of the ‘Botanist’s Guide’ in supposing that 
Mr. Jacob mistook Ruta~muraria for the present plant. 

Caernarvonshire. — Ray records that this fern was found by 
Mr. Llwyd on the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn.f Mr. Wilson 
has found it near Llyn-y-cwn, and Mr. Babington on rocks near 
the pass of Llanberis : I had the good fortune to discover it in 
profusion on a loose stone wall, about a mile from Llanrwst, on the 
Conway road ; the locality is on the left hand, looking towards 
Conway, and exactly opposite a small farm-yard. Several bo- 
tanists have visited the place subsequently, and taken it away in 
such quantities as nearly to destroy the habitat, — so nearly in- 
deed that others have been unable to discover a trace of its 
former existence. I deeply regret the prevalence of this exter- 
minating spirit, for it tends to deprive the true botanist of one 
of his greatest pleasures, — that of visiting rare plants in their 
native localities. It however affords me some satisfaction to 
know that the plant has been lately observed by Mr. Wilson 
on the same wall, two hundred yards nearer Conway, and that 
it grows in many other spots in the neighbourhood. 

Cumberland. — Mr. Heysham informs me that in 1837 and 
1838 he found this fern on Honister crags, and on crags in the 
vicinity of Scaw Fell. Hutchinson gives Patterdale and Kes- 
wick as localities. Turner and Dillwyn, on the authority of 
Mr. Wood, say it has been found in a ravine of the Screes, near 
Wastwater, about 600 feet in perpendicular height ; and Mr. 
Francis informs us that it occurs sparingly on rocks between the 
vale of Newlands and Borrowdale.

self, has often occurred to me.

Somersetshire. — In Sole’s MS. Flora of Somersetshire, As-

Blackford hill. Turner and Dillwyn also inform us, on the au- 
thority of Mr. Brown, that it occurs plentifully on the south side 
of Blackford hill. Mr. N. Ward found it plentifully on loose 
stone walls in the parish of Culbone, about six miles from the 
boundary of the county, and at an elevation of about 1000 feet 
above the sea : he has kindly contributed a liberal supply of 
specimens from this locality to my collection. It has also been 
found in profusion by the Rev. W. S. Here, on a loose stone 
wall, two miles north of the parish-church of Oare : perhaps 
this is identical with the locality discovered by Mr. Ward.

sume to be identical with Arthur’s seat, a locality often recorded, 
and one in which the plant still exists. Smith says it was also

ASPLENIACE.E. 


Asplenium septentrionale occurs most abundantly in Hungary, 
some parts of Germany, and the south of France : it is also 
recorded as an inhabitant of Lapland, Sweden, Denmark, Spain 
and Italy. In the north it seems very rare ; in the south much 
more common. I believe it has not yet been observed beyond 
the limits of Europe. 

The figures of a fern so very marked are of necessity charac- 
teristic : I scarcely know one by which the species may not in- 
stantly be known. 

The specific name of septentrionale appears to have obtained 
the concurrence of all botanists, but the genus has been a matter 
of difficulty and doubt. We find our earliest authors properly 
referring this plant to the ferns. We have seen that Gerarde 
considered it a moss ; and the opinions of himself and other au- 
thors are thus summed up by his emaculator, Johnson : — Our 
author formerly gave another figure of this plant by the name of 
Holosteum petr(Bum, which I have omitted, thinking this the 
better. Tragus,^ Lonicerus and Bauhine,f refer this to the 
femes, and the last of them calleth it Filix saxatilis corniculata. 
Pena and Lobel X made it their Holosteum alterum. Thalius 
calls it Adiantum Acrostichon seu furcatum^’’% Ray calls it 
Filix saxatilis and Linneus,1[ followed by Hudson, 

Bolton, Berkenhout, Withering, and several others, denominates 
\i Acrostichum septentrionale,h\iiY^\iherm^ observes that when 
young it is an Asplenium. Roth removes this species, together 
with Aspl. germanicum and Aspl. Jiuta-muraria^ to the genus 
Scolopendrium, which also includes Scol. vulgare and Ceterach 
officinarum of the present work. His character of this compre- 
hensive genus is given below.* ** ^ It seems scarcely my province, 
in a work like the present, to propose new generic divisions ; 
but I shall perhaps be pardoned for stating that Ruta-muraria^ 
germanicum and septentrionale ^ form a group very distinct from 
the other British species, inasmuch as their pinnules appear to

want the mesian nerve or midvein, which is always present in 
the rest : hence the group might perhaps be called Amesium. 

The roots are very long, fibrous, crooked and intertwined, and, 
together with the rhizoma, which is very large and tufted, form 
an amazing bulk. 

The fronds make their appearance in March and April, arrive 
at maturity in August, and remain green throughout the winter ; 
they grow in a horizontal position from a perpendicular surface. 
The fronds represented at page 269 are in the natural position. 
The form of the frond is elongate, lanceolate, and furnished late- 
rally with one or two short bifid teeth or serratures, and the apex 
also terminates in a bifid point : it diminishes imperceptibly to- 
wards the base, and there terminates in a smooth stem, which is 
black at the extreme base. 

The veins are nearly simple, and 
into each serrature. The capsules 
a continuous line, covered at first 
by an involucre of similar shape, 
which opens towards the middle 
of the frond, and, as the capsules 
swell, is thrown back, and finally 
lost, and the lower surface of the 
nuous mass of capsules. 

Roth describes the involucre as double,^ but this, although

certainly the case as regards the apical portion of the frond, is 
not so with the basal portion. In a foot-note on the preceding 
page I have quoted Roth’s observation on this structure, think- 
ing that botanists will be interested in perusing it. 

This fern is so very different from every other British species, 
that there is not the slightest danger of any confusion occurring 
in this way. On the other hand, its similarity to the Buck’s-horn 
Plantain [Plantago Co7'onopus) is so great, that a superficial ob- 
server might well be excused for mistaking it for that plant. Al- 
though occasionally established in lofty and exposed situations, 
it can scarcely be considered a hardy species, since it is very 
susceptible of cold, its young fronds being injured by a slight 
frost, as noticed by Mr. Watson. 

The vignette below is from a hasty sketch of Conway castle, 
a building which, by situation, is somewhat associated with the 
principal British locality of this curious little fern.

Asplenium marinum, Linneus. 

This fem is, as its name implies, essentially a marine species, 
rooting deeply in the fissures of sea-cliffs, or clothing the roof 
of sea-caves, in the darkest recesses of which it seems to luxu- 
riate. Its range in Great Britain is very extensive, but confined 
entirely to those counties which are washed by the sea. In the 
following brief summary of English and Welsh localities its al- 
most total absence from the eastern coast is worthy of remark. 

Anglesea. — We learn from Ray that it occurs on the rocks 
about Priestholm island and at Llandwyn ; the Rev. Hugh 
Davies says it is common on the rocks ; and Mr. Watson gives 
me the South Stack as a locality. 

Caernarvonshire. — Mr. Pinder informs me he found it on 
the Eagle-tower in Caernarvon- castle ; and Mr. Wilson has 
found it at Orme’s head. 

Cardiganshire. — In many places: I found it very fine on the 
Castle-rock, and on the Castle- wall at Aberystwith. 

Cheshire. — I found it on the rocks called the Red Noses at 
New Brighton ; and Mr. Wilson and Mr. Watson have subse- 
quently given me this as a station. Dr. Wood informs me that 
‘‘on the rocks of Hilber island, at the mouth of the river Dee,

Cornwall. — In this county the Sea Spleenwort is abundant 
and luxuriant. Miss Warren informs me that it grows both on 
the northern and southern coasts: and that it is particularly fine 
near St. Ives. Mr. Ralfs says it is fine and abundant at Mouse- 
hole. Messrs Watson, Greenwood, Peirson, H. Christy, &c., 
have given me numerous other localities, almost comprising the 
entire coast. The form of the frond in Cornish specimens is 
more elongate than in those from Liverpool, and the habit alto- 
gether different. 

Cumberland. — Mr. Heysham informs me he has found it 
near Whitehaven ; and Mr. Pinder has supplied me most abun- 
dantly wdth beautiful specimens, both from this place and St. 
Bees’ head. 

Devonshire. — Miss Griffiths gives me Dawlish and Ilfra- 
combe as localities. The Rev. W. S. Hore informs me it is 
common in sea-caves ; Mr. Ralfs has found it at Torquay and 
Salcombe. Mr. Beynon informs me that it grows in cavernous 
fissures of the rocbs in many parts of the coast near Torquay, — 
for instance. Liver-mead, Daddy-hole, Mead-foot, and Hope’s- 
nose. Mr. Sparkes observed it in a sea-cave at Babbicombe ; 
and Mr. Jordan between Dawlish and Teignmouth.

Glamorganshire. —I learn from Mr. Dillwyn and other bota-

Mumbles light-house ; between the Mumbles and Penyard-cas- 
tle ; near Swansea ; near Dunraven ; near Oystermouth ; on 
Barry island, coast of Gower ; and plentifully in Bacon’s hole. 

Lancashire. — I believe Bolton first observed this fern in the 
Win wick stone-quarry, near Warrington. Mr. Wilson informs 
me it still grows there, but is always of small size, and rarely 
produces fruit: I am indebted to Mr. Wilson and Dr. Wood for 
specimens from that locality. Mr. Gibson found it about two 
miles from Liverpool, on the way to Runcorn ; Mr. S. Thomp- 
son informs me he has found it at Knot’s hole, the Dingle ; and 
adds, that he is also informed on good authority, that it grows 
on the red sandstone rock in the village of Newton, on the Li- 
verpool and Manchester railway. Mr. Simpson has observed it 
abundantly on the rocks near Heysham, and in a cave at the 
head of Morecambe bay. 

Merionethshire. — I have seen specimens from near Towyn. 

Pembrokeshire. — Mr. Kippist informs me that he observed it 
abundantly in several places along the cliffs between Tenby and 
Saundersfoot ; and Mr. Lees that he found it in deep fissures of 
the trap rocks at Fishguard, and in caves and cavities of the old 
red sandstone near St. Justinian’s chapel, St. David’s, opposite 
to Ramsay island, on St. Catherine’s island, Tenby, &c. 

Somersetshire. — Mr. Grindon informs me that he found it 
in a cave by the rocky beach near Clevedon, on the 6th of July, 
1842. It formerly grew here in great abundance, and also at 
Portishead. 

Sussex. — Ray found this fern about the Castle-rock at Hast- 
ings ; and 1 am informed by Mr. Yarrell, Mr. Borrer and Mr. 
Jenner, that it still exists in the same locality. 

Westmoreland. — Mr. Binder and Mr. Hindson inform me 
they have found it in this county in a sea-cave near Silverdale. 


278 


ASPLENIACE.E. 


Yorkshiee. — Mr. S. Gibson informs me that it occurs very 
sparingly on cliffs north of Scarborough. 

In Scotland it is of common occurrence, particularly along 
the eastern coast. The coast of Aberdeen, Fife and Berwick- 
shire may be particularly noticed. On the western coast it is 
either less abundant, or has not been so frequently noticed. 
Some years since I observed it growing sparingly in the vertical 
fissures of the columnar basalt at Staffa, and again more abun- 
dantly, and intermixed with Adiantum-nigrum and Ruta-mu- 
raria^ on the cathedral at Iona. Except in this instance, I 
never recollect having seen it established on a building. 

In the Isle of Man it has been noticed by Mr. Wilson. 

In Ireland its localities are far too numerous to be particular- 
ized. In my rambles in that beautiful country I found it on the 
sea-cliffs whenever I reached the coast : and I believe the Irish 
botanists have observed it in every county that borders the sea. 
I must, however, mention one locality that struck me as remark- 
able ; I allude to the lakes of Killarney. As you skirt the upper 
lake on the way to Kenmare, there is a spot where the rock has 
been blasted by gunpowder, for the purpose of making a good 
carriage-way between Turk mountain on the left, and the lake 
on the right. On this rock the Spleenwort has thoroughly esta- 
blished itself : the plants 
are of small size and ra- 
ther remarkable form, 
and they are not to be 
procured without consi- 
derable difficulty, the 
face of the rock being 
steep, and difficult to 
climb, and the little 
plants very firmly rooted in the fissures. I succeeded after some 
trouble in detaching two specimens, the largest of which is re- 
presented in the margin. I confess I feel rather gratified in the 
belief that while it can escape the eye of no botanist who may 
chance to visit the spot after reading this notice, it will long, 
by its inaccessible situation, be rescued from extermination. 
Mr. W. Thompson, whose valuable memoranda I have so often 



SEA SPLEENWORT. 


279 


quoted, informs me that all the forms figured in this work are of 
common occurrence to the south of Newcastle, county Down. 

In the Channel islands it is abundant and luxuriant. Mr. H. 
Doubleday, in a letter written on his return from spending a few 
days there, says — At a lovely spot on the southern coast of 
Guernsey, called Petit Bot bay, I found a large cave, from the 
roof of which grew thousands of fronds of Asplenium marinum; 
many of them were two feet, and one thirty inches in length, in- 
cluding the naked part of the stem.” 

Its European range appears limited to the coasts of France 
and Spain : it is very luxuriant in Madeira and Teneritfe, and 
according to Sadler has been found in northern Africa, but I 
have never heard of its occurrence in other countries. 

There is a good figure of this fern in Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’^ 
another in ‘ English Botany ,’f and a third in Hooker’s ^ Flora 
Londinensis.’J 

Among botanists of the present day there is no difference of 
opinion as to its nomenclature : on the continent of Europe it is 
but little known to botanists, and in this country all our authors 
agree in calling it Asplenium marinum. It should however be 
remarked, that the different forms of the northern and southern 
plants, have induced some of our older authors to suppose we 
have two species. The northern plant is the Adiantum majus 
Coriandri folio ^ Adianto vero affine y pediculo pallide rubente of 
Sibbald,§ and also the Adianto vero affinis minor Scotica folio 
ohtuso saturate viridi of the same author, || as quoted in Bay’s 
‘ Synopsis ; ’ H and the Adiantum trapeziforme of Hudson 
and Berkenhout.ft Withering properly referred this sup- 
posed species to Asplenium marinum. The southern plant is 
the Cliamcdfilix marina Anglica of Bauhin§§ and Bay,|||| the 
Filicula petrcsa femina seu Cliamafilix marina Anglica of Ge- 
rarde,1[ IT and the Asplenium marinum of Hudson, Berkenhout, 
and all modern botanists.

ASPLENIACEiE. 


Ray recommends this fern as a medicine in cases of obstruc- 
tion, and also informs us that the mucilage extracted from it, 
when applied externally, is recommended for burns when all 
other applications have failed.^ 

The roots of Asplenium marinum are black, wiry, tough, long, 
and so firmly fixed in the crevices of rock, that it cannot be 
eradicated without considerable trouble : the rhizoma is tufted, 
black, and covered with bristly scales : the fronds make their 
appearance in June and July, ripen their seed in October and 
November, and remain perfectly green throughout the year. In 
August the fronds of two seasons are equally vigorous, the 
younger ones being distinguished by their paler colour and im- 
mature fructification. 

The frond is linear and simply pinnate, the pinnae are stalked 
and serrated ; their forms are various, as will be seen by the fi- 
gures, two larger than the rest frequently appear near the apex: 
the pinnae are connected by a narrow wing running along the 
rachis, as shown at d, page 276. The lateral veins are forked 
almost immediately after leaving the midvein ; the anterior 
branch bears a long linear cluster of bright rust-coloured cap- 
sules ; this, when young, is covered by a white membranous 
involucre, of similar form, which always opens towards the 
apex of the frond. 

It is a most difficult fern to deal with in cultivation, unless 
carefully protected from exposure : it will thrive luxuriantly in 
a stove-house, with a moist heat of 70° Fahr., but dies on rock- 
work, even in the purest air, if denied the advantage of the 
sea-breeze ; this is the more remarkable, since at Newton, War- 
rington, and Killarney, as recorded in the preceding pages, it 
has voluntarily forsaken the vicinity of the sea. 

It may be here observed that the present species, together 
with Aspl. viride and Aspl. Trichomanes, form another natural 
group, distinguished by the elongate and simply pinnate frond, 
by a great uniformity in the character of the pinnae, and by a si- 
milarity in the venation,

Asplenium viride, Hudson. 

This is a beautiful little fern, delighting in wild hilly coun- 
tries, especially if abounding in waterfalls, and shunning the 
vicinity of man. It is found rooted firmly in the fissures of 
rocks; when sheltered, growing to a length of eight or ten 
inches, but when exposed, seldom measuring more than two. 
The following list of localities will show its range in England 
and Wales. 

Brecknockshire. — Mr. Ralfs informs me he has found it 
near Brecon, on Brecon-beacon, and on Trecastle-beacon : Mr. 
Westcombe gives me Chapel-y-Fin as a habitat: Mr. Lees ob- 
served it at the waterfall of Scwyd-yr-Henryd near Capel Col- 
bren, on the rocks below the fall, on the right hand side, where 
there is also a very old trunk of mountain-ash covered with a 
drapery of this fern.

me Falcon dints as a locality. 

Derbyshire. — Mr. Finder informs me it is remarkably abun- 
dant and luxuriant in Cavedale, Castleton ; and Dr. Wood that 
it is abundant near Buxton. I am indebted to Mr. Finder for a 
liberal supply of specimens. 

Glamorganshire. — Mr. Dillwyn has found it in crevices of 
the rocks at the upper Cilhepste waterfall, near Font Nedd 
Vechn, and at Darran yr Ogof, near Ystradgunlais.^ Mr. Ba- 
bington informs me he found it at Merthyr Tydfil. 

Lancashire. — Mr. Sidebotham informs me it grows at Dules- 
gate, and it is said to have been found in the quarries at Staley, 
but he has not seen it from the latter locality. 

Leicestershire. — “A few plants were found in the crevices 
of the crags on Charley forest, at Beacon-hill : Fulteney.” — Bo- 
tanisfs Guide. The Rev. A. Bloxam, to whom I am indebted 
for a list of Leicestershire ferns, does not mention this species. 

Merionethshire. — I observed it sparingly on Cader Idris. 

Northumberland. — Mr. Winch found this fern sparingly on 
rocks by the Irthing at Wardrew. 

Westmoreland. — Mr. Finder has favored me with specimens 
from Hutton-roof, Farlton and Arnside. Mr. Hindson informs 
me it is found on Casterton fell; and Mr. Watson, on the au- 
thority of Mr. Bowman, informs me that it has been found at 
Mazebeck scar. 

Worcestershire. — On Ham-bridge: first observed there by 
Mr. Stretch of Worcester; the station afterwards verified by Mr. 
Leesf and Mr. Westcombe.f I had long noted Ham-bridge as 
a locality worthy of a visit on account of its producing this fern, 
and resolved to make it an object of pilgrimage. In May last I 
wended my way from Sapey brook, along the rich valley of the 
Teme, through meadows clothed with luxuriant herbage, and 
among cattle fit for a Smithfield show. As I approached the 
bridge, the red bricks of which it is built, and the dry and

dusty road which passed over it, seemed in no degree to increase 
the chance of success : yet on that bridge, facing the road-way 
and covered with dust, was the identical plant I sought — small 
indeed, but the species not to be mistaken.* 

Yorkshire. — Mr. Tatham, who informs me it is very common 
on the limestone cliffs above the town of Settle, has kindly sup- 
plied me with specimens. It has also been found near Halifax, 
Ais-la-beck, Richmond, Gordale, Gilla-leys wood, and other lo- 
calities too numerous to mention. 

In the Highlands of Scotland Asplenium viride is a fern of 
common occurrence. I should not call it an abundant fern, but 
it is almost impossible to wander amongst the mountains with- 
out frequently noticing it : a few counties are given below. 

Argyleshire.—I observed it in several localities. 

Dumbartonshire. — Mr. Gourlie has found it on Ben Voirlich. 

Lanarkshire. — I observed it growing by the Falls of Clyde ; 
and Dr. Balfour, Mr. Gourlie, and other Scotch botanists appear 
to be well acquainted with this station. 

Nairnshire. — Mr. Stables informs me that it is of common 
occurrence in congenial situations in this county. 

Perthshire. Mr. Gourlie and several other botanists have 
found it on Ben Lawers. 

Rosshire.— The Rev. G. Gordon has observed it in Rosshire. 

Sutherlandshire. — Mr. Watson has observed it in this 
county. 

In Ireland this fern appears to be much less common than in 
Scotland or the North of England. 

Cork.— Dr. Taylor has found it near Bandon in this county. 

Donegal. — Mr. W. Thompson informs me it was found by 
Mr. E. Murphy near Lough Eask. 

Kerry. — -Mr. Mackay and several other botanists give Turk 
mountain, by the Lakes of Killarney, as a locality. 

Sligo. —   Mr. W. Thompson and several other botanists have

Asplenium viride is found in all the countries of Europe, but 
I have not heard of its occurrence beyond the limits of that 
continent.

ASPLENIACEiE. 


The root is fibrous, black, and rather tender, the rhizoma 
black, scaly and tufted ; the fronds appear in May and June, 
arrive at maturity in August, and remain green through the win- 
ter: they are fertile only. The stem is naked for about a third 
of its length : half the naked portion is black or purplish ; the 
remainder to the apex of the frond is of a vivid green : the frond 
is narrow, long, linear, and simply pinnate ; the pinnae are not 
so numerous as in Trichomanes, they are quadrate, but without 
angles, and are more or less crenate at the margin ; they are for 
the most part placed alternately, and are generally very distinct 
and distant, but I have seen them crowded, as, for instance, in 
the plants from Ham-bridge : they are attached to the rachis by 
their stalks only. The lateral veins are either simple or forked; 
they bear a long, linear cluster of capsules, and when forked, 
the division almost invariably takes place beyond the capsules : 
this appears to me a very excellent diagnostic, and one by 
which this species may readily be known from Trichomanes : 
some of the veins reach the margin of the pinna. The capsules 
are at first covered by a long white involucre, which soon dis- 
appears, and they become a bright ferruginous confluent mass, 
occupying the middle of the pinna, and concealing its midvein. 
The clusters, before their union, are usually six in number. 

Mr. Gibson of Hebden-bridge has specimens of this plant 
which have the pinnae very long and pointed : I am indebted to 
Mr. Gibson for a sight of this variety, which he proposes to call 
acutifolium. 

There are good figures of this fern in Sowerby’s ‘English Bo- 
tany,’^' and in Schkuhr.f 

We are indebted to our countryman Hudson for first describ- 
ing this fern with a specific name.J It is described by Llwyd 
as a species in Ray’s Synopsis, under the name of Trichomanes 
ramosum ; § but Linneus, notwithstanding its diagnostics are 
there clearly pointed out, makes it a variety of Aspl. Trichoma- 
nes, under the name of Asplenium Trichomanes ramosum. || 
Hudson’s name has been adopted by all subsequent authors.

COMMON SPLEENWORT, [half the natural size). 

Asplenium Trtchomanes, Linneus. 

This plant occurs so generally throughout England, Wales, 
Scotland and Ireland, that I do not feel myself justified in print- 
ing a list of localities ; it grows on rocks, walls, churches, ruins, 
bridges, and sometimes, but less frequently, on banks and in 
hedge-rows. In the eastern counties it is much less common 
than in the western : in Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk it may be 
considered rare, but it occurs in all these counties. I am in- 
debted to Mr. G. S. Gibson for a specimen from Hadstock 
church, and to Mr. R. Jacob for another from Stortford, both in 
Essex. In the west of England, and especially in Wales, it is 
a common fern. I once saw it in the valley of the Wye, grow- 
ing in such profusion on a little bridge near the town of Bualt, 
that it formed a continuous covering of green, and presented a 
very beautiful appearance. There is scarcely anything in the 
vegetable world more beautiful than such a scene as this ; and 
it is only known by those who have tried the experiment, how 
readily such a scene may be transferred to a garden. 

This beautiful little fern is found in every country of Europe, 


286 


ASPLENIACE^. 


in Africa, and in the United States of North America, where it 
has been called melanocaulon and Trichomanoides ; but after a 
careful comparison I am unable to detect the slightest difference 
between the North- American and British plants. 

There are good figures of this fern in Gerarde,^ Bolton,i 
‘English Botany ,’J Hooker’s ‘Flora Londinensis,’§ and in many 
of the continental Floras. 

Concerning the name little difference of opinion has prevailed. 
Berkenhout,|l and one or two others, have called it Trichoma- 
noides, but nearly all authors have described it as Asplenium 
Trichomanes. 

Its medicinal properties were much celebrated by the older 
botanists. Baylf says it is useful in complaints of the chest and 
lungs ; and Lightfoot informs us that in Scotland the country 
people sometimes give a tea or syrup of it for coughs and other 
complaints of the thorax, but that it is rarely sold in the shops.^'^ 

The roots are black and wiry : they insinuate themselves into 
the fissures of rocks previously so small as to escape observa- 
tion. In old buildings this fern certainly promotes decay, by 
disintegrating the mortar, which, however enfeebled by time, 
still adds in some degree to their strength and durability. The 
fronds make their appearance in April and May, arrive at ma- 
turity in August and September, and remain perfectly green 
throughout the winter. The stem is naked for a third part of its 
length, smooth, shining, and, throughout its whole length, of a 
purplish black colour. The frond is narrow, linear, and simply 
pinnate ; the pinnae are dark green and very numerous, irregu- 
larly ovate, obtuse at the apex and more or less crenate at the 
margin ; they are usually distinct and distant, but sometimes 
crowded, and each more or less recumbent on the one preceding 
it : they are attached to the stem by their stalk only, and when 
the frond approaches decay, the pinnae fall off like the leaves of 
phaenogamous plants, leaving the stems naked, which, being 
very durable, last from year to year, and become a dense tuft of 
denuded bristles. The pinnules vary from the size of those re-

presented at page 285, to that of the detached ones in the same 
figure, intended to illustrate the fructification. The lateral veins 
are forked soon after leaving the midvein (see fig. a), the anterior 
branch bearing a linear cluster of capsules almost immediately 
after the division ; this cluster is at first covered by a long, li- 
near, white, membranous involucre, (see fig. b) : as the capsules 
swell this becomes obliterated, and the clusters, which are dark 
brown, become nearly confluent in two series (see fig. c), which 
however very rarely unite over the midrib : the clusters are ten 
or twelve in number. 

This fern is, generally speaking, constant in its form, and ra- 
ther remarkable for its uniformity of appearance. I have, how- 
ever, received a marked variety from Mr. Gibson 
of Hebden-bridge. The pinnae, instead of being 
nearly entire, as is usually the case, are deeply 
pinnatifid, as represented in the accompanying 
figure, and the pinnules or lobes are irregularly 
dentate. The specimens sent by Mr. Gibson 
are perfectly without fructification, but I do not 
know whether this is to be considered a charac- 
ter of the variety, or incidental only to the fronds 
I have received. The right-hand figure is a 
fac-simile representation of one frond as regards 
form and size; the left-hand figure represents a 
portion of a frond, in which the divisions are 
still more irregular. 

This beautiful variety appears to have been 
known to our earliest botanists, two previous 
figures existing in their works ; neither of them, 
however, represents the fronds quite so deeply 
divided as in the present instance. One figure is in Plukenet’s 
‘ Phytographia,’^ the plant being described in that author’s ‘Al- 
magestum Botanicum’f as Adiantum maritimum, segmentis ro~ 
tundiorihm : ’ it is stated, on the authority of Sherard, to have 
been found in Jersey. The second figure is in plate 315 of

Tournefort’s ‘ Institutiones Rei Herbariae ; ’ it is also noticed in 
Dillenius’ edition of Ray’s ‘ Synopsis,’ and by Smith, in the 
‘ English Flora,’ where it constitutes the variety of Asplenium 
Trichomanes. The variety y. of Smith, to which that author 
quotes Sir Robert Sibbald’s description, appears to have little 
resemblance to the variety, or even species in question, if I 
may venture to judge from Sibbald’s plate 3, figure 4, to which 
Smith refers; but as to the correctness of the reference, I am 
unable to speak, for Sibbald himself has, in no way that I can 
discover, connected the text and figure. 

Mr. Gibson’s plant was gathered at Kant- dough, four miles 
from Burnley, in Lancashire : it was originally discovered there 
in 1832, and some plants taken up at that date and planted in a 
garden at Halifax, have been found to retain their remarkable 
character in cultivation. A very similar variety has been found 
in Devonshire by the Rev. W. S. Here, who has kindly sent me 
a specimen.

HART’S TONGUE SPLEENWORT {one-eighth natural size). 

ScoLOPENDRiUM VULGARE, Symons. 

The Hart’s Tongue is a particularly handsome and ornamen- 
tal fern : its habit is well marked, and very decidedly diiferent 
from every other British species. I believe it is universally, al- 
though not abundantly distributed : it so frequently grows in the 
thickest part of hedges that it may readily escape observation, and 
thus does not appear so abundant as it really is. In Scotland I 
found it sparingly distributed, but I never passed a day without 
recognizing it in some few localities. In Ireland it is much 

u 


290 


ASPLENIACE.E. 


more abundant ; it is not only scattered generally over the island, 
but occurs in some localities in very great abundance, parti- 
cularly in the neighbourhood of Sligo, and in the demesne of 
Muckruss, near Killarney ; it here grows among the underwood, 
in the shrubberies, &c. in large luxuriant tufts, the fronds radi- 
ating from a common centre, and each being gracefully arched 
in a semicircle, like the long feathers of a cock’s tail. The 
Hart’s Tongue is very commonly found on walls and ruins; and 
it seems particularly to delight in old wells, in which last situa- 
tion its fronds sometimes grow to a very large size. 

I believe this handsome species is found in every country 
throughout Europe, but is very sparingly distributed towards the 
north. It has also been found in the United States, but is there 
considered one of the rarest of ferns. I know nothing of it in 
Africa, Asia, or South America. 

It is almost impossible to fail in giving an intelligible repre- 
sentation of so marked a species. All the British and continen- 
tal figures sufficiently exhibit its very distinctive form. 

This fern is the Phyllitis of Ray,^ and all the older authors. 
Linneus made it an Asplenium,\ giving it the specific name of 
Scolopendrium, in which he was followed by Hudson,! Berken- 
hout,§ Withering, II and Hofimann.^ Sir J. E. Smith, in the 
^ Turin Transactions,’^^ separated it from Asplenium as a new 
genus, to which he gave the name of Scolopendrium : in this 
genus he included Ceterach. The present plant was described 
by Symons,tt as Scolopendrium vulgare^ a name adopted by 
Smith, Hooker, Francis and Babington : on the continent, 
Swartz §§ adopted Smith’s genus, but gave it the specific name 
of officinarum : in this he was followed by Willdenow and We- 
ber and Mohr. It is the Scolopendrium Phyllitis of Roth,|||| 
and the Scolopendrium officinale of the ^ Flore Frangaise.’ 
From this statement, which I have endeavoured to compress in- 
to the smallest possible compass, I think it will appear that there 
is no generally adopted name for this species, and that the Bri-

tish is totally different from the continental nomenclature. I am 
quite at a loss to understand the genus Scolopendriumy as esta- 
blished by Smith for two species so totally 
dissimilar that they may be said to possess 
little in common but the name of Hart’s 
Tongue ; and I consider it a usage of very 
questionable propriety to convert an esta- 
blished specific into a generic name. It ap- 
pears to me that the present species, together 
with the Portuguese Hemionitis, constitute 
a natural division of the great Linnean group 
Asplenium, which still requires a generic ap- 
pellation : in this case the original and well- 
known term Phyllitis might with propriety be 
employed, but an invincible dislike to the in- 
troduction of names, leads me for the present 
to adopt Smith’s nomenclature, protesting, 
however, against his group Scolopendrium, 
both as unnatural and ill-named. 

We learn from the herbalists that this plant 
was much in vogue as a medicine. Ray speaks 
of it favourably as an astringent, and of its 
healing powers, applied as an ointment to V U \ 
wounds and ulcers.^ Lightfoot says it is 
used by the country people in Scotland, as a 
vulnerary for burns and scalds : f and we / / \ / 

learn from the ‘ Flore Frangaise ’ that it is 
used in France as an astringent in cases of ^ 
diarrhoea and haemorrhage.]; \ 

The roots are black, stout, and very long ; 
and strong : the rhizoma is tufted, blackish, / 
scaly, and almost spherical : the young fronds 
make their appearance in April, growing in an ff\ \ 

erect position, the apex remaining circinate ; 
by degrees they become horizontal, and at 
last pendulous ; they arrive at maturity by the end of Septem

ber, and continue in full vigour throughout the winter, and until 
those of the ensuing year make their appearance. 

The form of the frond is elongate, linear, and quite undivided, 
acute at the apex and cordate at the base. The naked portion 
of the stem varies from a tenth to about a third of the entire 
length of the frond ; it is of a dark purple colour, and rather 
scaly at the base : in some specimens, but these are generally 
young, the entire plant is hirsute, in others perfectly glabrous. 
The seedling plants put on a variety of forms ; a few of them 
are shown at the top of the cut in the preceding page. 

The veins proceed directly from the stem, and each has four 
or five branches : to the outside branches of each vein, or set of 
veins, is attached a long line of capsules, covered by a white 
membranous involucre of the same form. Owing to this dispo- 
sition of the capsules on the outer branch, the masses are inva- 
riably in pairs ; the two involucres at first touch, and appear as 
one ; a day or two later a line appears between them, showing 
that they are divided ; the line gradually becomes more appa- 
rent as the capsules increase in size ; at last, the two involucres 
are pushed back from each other, and finally disappear. The 
veins and attachment of capsules are shown on the upper side 
of the figure ; the involucres and clusters on the lower side : the 
earliest stage of the double line and its involucres is shown to 
the left hand, and each successive figure towards the right shows 
a gradual advance to maturity.

of England, making its appearance on ruins, churches and old 
walls. In the midland counties it is of rare occurrence, and in 
the eastern is scarcely known. In a few instances it is found on 
rocks, which must be considered its native habitat ; and I have 
particularly to acknowledge my obligation to those botanists 
who have noticed this and other interesting particulars connected 
with its choice of situation. From the great number of commu- 
nications received I am compelled to omit many notices that I 
would gladly have published. I have however made my selec- 
tion so as to embrace the principal facts as regards its geogra- 
phical range. In England, Westmoreland, Somerset and Glou- 
cester appear to be counties in which it occurs most abundantly.

Mr. Murcott on a wall at Aberdare, on a bridge near Aberdare, 
and on the walls of Caerphilly castle. 

Gloucestershire. — I have observed this fern to be unusually 
common in this county, having noticed it in many and distant 
localities, as near Bristol, Cheltenham, Tewkesbury, Painswick,

fusely clothing almost every old wall about that place ; equally 
abundant on the loose stone walls near Chepstow, on the Glou-

Malvern : Mr. Lees says it occurs sparingly on walls at Great 
Malvern, and Mr. Westcombe at Badsey near Evesham, and in 
Wych-wood forest. 

Yorkshire. — Dr. Richardson, in Ray’s ‘ Synopsis,’ observes 
that it occurs in some abundance above Malham-tarn : and Mr. 
Tatham informs me it still grows here, although sparingly. Mr.

as a second locality. 

In Scotland the fern is of great rarity; the following localities 
have been handed me by correspondents. 

Argyleshire. — Mr. Gourlie informs me it has been found 
sparingly at Kilfinnan. 

Perthshire. — - Mr. Gourlie has found it on Kinnoul-hill. 
Lightfoot had previously recorded this locality in the ^ Flora 
Scotica.’ 

Renfrewshire. — Mr. Gourlie states that Dr. A. K. Young 
has observed it near Paisley. 

In Ireland, particularly in the West and South, the Scaly 
Spleenwort is a fern of common occurrence, and grows to a 
large size. 

Antrim.— Mr. W. Thompson informs me that in the late Mr.

Clare. — Mr. W. Thompson says it is common on the lime-

Cork. — I observed it most abundantly in many parts of this 
county : Ceterach^ Adiantum-nigrum^ Ruta~muraria, Tricho- 
manes and Scolopendrium half cover many of the walls about 
Cork and Fermoy. 

Down. — From Mr. W. Thompson I learn that it occurs at 
Bryansford. 

Fermanagh. — Mr. W. Thompson informs me that the Hon. J. 
L. Cole observed it at Florence-court in this county. 

Galway. — Mr. W. Thompson observes it is common on the 
limestone in this county. In many parts of the county I ob- 
served it in the greatest possible luxuriance. In and about the 
little town of Oughterard I was much struck by its beautiful ap- 
pearance, intermixed with Cotyledon Umbilicus^ there also gi- 
gantic, nearly covering many of the humble dwellings. 

Kerry. — I observed it upon rocks and walls in many places 
round Killarney. 

Kilkenny. — Mr. Mackay observes that it is abundant at the 
marble- quarries at Kilkenny. 

Limerick. — I saw it in many places near the town of Limerick. 

Waterford. — I saw Ceterach in many parts of this county : 
it occurs here and there on nearly all the walls between Clon- 
mel and Waterford. 

Wicklow. — I observed this fern on several of the old build- 
ings at Glendalough. 

The Scaly Spleenwort is found in all the middle and southern 
countries of Europe, but I believe it has not yet been ob- 
served in Lapland, Norway, Sweden, or the North of Russia : 
it is common in the North of Africa, in the Canary and Cape de 
Verd Islands. In Madeira and Tenerilfe there is a plant of 
much larger size than ours, and of more beautiful appearance ; 
I cannot take on myself to say whether the two forms are iden- 
tical as species.

Sowerby’s ‘ English Botany,’* and Gerardo’s Herbal. f Those 
in Bolton t and many other works would not be recognized. 

This fern is the Ceterach, Spleenwort or Miltwast of Gerarde,§ 
the Ceterach officinarum of Bauhin’s ‘Pinax,’|| and the Asple- 
nium sive Ceterach of RayH and others. Linneus made it an 
Asplenium,^* and subsequent authors have differed much as to 
its nomenclature. 

Its medicinal properties were formerly supposed of great va- 
lue, but like those of its congeners, they have greatly fallen into 
disrepute : it was once supposed very efficacious applied exter- 
nally to wounds and ulcers. It has, moreover, other vertues as 
they were called, in addition to its medicinal ones, some of these 
are enumerated by Gerarde, but they appear so very like vices, 
that I decline transferring them to these pages. Gerarde him- 
self, after dwelling on one of them with great apparent zest, 
adds, “ But this is to be reckoned among the old wives’ fables, 
and that also which Dioscorides tells of, touching the gathering 
of Spleenwort in the night, and other most vain things which 
are found here and there scattered in old books : from which 
most of the later writers do not abstaine who many times fill up 
their pages with lies and frivolous toyes, and by so doing do not 
a little deceive yong students.”tf Pleasant herbalist ! I fear 
I should neglect thy sage advice, could I but find a plea for in- 
troducing thy Bernacle goose-tree amongst the British Ferns. 

The roots of the Scaly Spleenwort are short, but possess a re- 
markable power of penetrating mortar, however hard it may be : 
they also find their way into rocks which appear to present the 
most compact surface : still from the luxuriance of some plants 
lately sent me by Mr. Thwaites, it would appear that this spe- 
cies thrives much more vigorously in the rich vegetable mould 
which has been accumulating during centuries in the deeper fis- 
sures : here the roots are longer, but still appear short as com- 
pared with those of Trichomanes and other rock-loving species. 
The rhizoma is tufted, brown and scaly. The young fronds

make their appearance in May, arrive at maturity in autumn, and 
continue green and vigorous throughout the winter : they are 
always fertile. A small portion of the stem is naked, but beset 
more or less thickly with pointed scales : the form of the frond 
is linear, slightly attenuated below, and deeply pinnatifid ; the 
segments are short, rounded, and sometimes crenate or lobed, 
their position as regards the stem is rather oblique ; their entire 
under surface is densely clothed with brown, pointed, imbricated 
scales, which, when examined under the microscope, are found 
to be very beautifully reticulated. 

The venation and fructification of this fern appear to have 
been greatly misunderstood : even Presl, who lays so great stress 
on these characters, has totally misrepresented them. The late- 
ral veins are few in number, alter- 
nate, and irregularly branched ; the 
branches occasionally anastomose 
before their termination, as repre- 
sented by the figure in the margin : 
the anterior branch of each bears an 
elongate cluster of capsules; these 
are situated about midway between 
the midrib and margin of the pinna : 
the points of their attachment are 
indicated in the figure : the first 
anterior lateral vein usually bears 
two of these clusters of capsules, one on each of its principal 
branches. The capsules are attached to that side of the vein 
which is nearest the median line of the pinnae, and not on the 
back of the vein, in this respect following the formula of the 
other Aspleniacece, and totally differing from that of the Poly- 
podiacece ondi Aspidiacean. It should, however, be observed that 
the capsules seated on the vein nearest the main stem of the 
frond, are placed in a position opposite to that of the rest, and, in 
this instance, the dehiscence of the involucre may be said to take 
place towards the main stem. Immediately adjoining the insertion 
of the capsules, and attached to the back of the vein, is an erect, 
white, membranous involucre, exactly corresponding in length 
with the line of capsules with which it is connected. In a very 



302 


ASPLENIACE^. 


early stage of the plant, before the frond is perfectly unfolded, I 
have found this involucre somewhat incumbent on the capsules, 
but it very soon assumes its erect position, and as the cap- 
sules advance towards maturity, its character is lost, and it is 
only to be recognized by those who have made themselves tho- 
roughly acquainted with it in its earlier stages. Beneath the 
capsules is a very inconspicuous ridge, and this also accompa- 
nies each line of capsules throughout its whole course. This 
ridge is so minute, so nearly imperceptible, that I merely notice 
its existence because one author appears to have regarded it 
as a second involucre. Sir J. E. Smith says, — “ Covers one at 
each side of each mass, as in the preceding species [^Scolopen- 
drium vulgare], erect, membranous, continuous, undulated, en- 
tire, quite distinct from the pointed separate scales. I cannot 
ascertain whether the lines of capsules are originally double, as 
in Scolopendrium vulgare^ but the covers are evidently such as 
leave no doubt of the genus, answering exactly to Tournefort’s 
figure, which Swartz and Willdenow surely did not examine. 
The latter indeed has well removed this fern from Grammitis, to 
which indeed it has no natural affinity.”*^ T may observe that 
the doubt here expressed as to the lines of capsules being origi- 
nally double, or in other words, seated on two parallel and ap- 
proximate veins, admits of a ready solution. A reference to the 
figure in the margin will at once show that this is not the case. 
Again I cannot allow the reference to Tournefort’s figuref to 
pass unnoticed, for on turning to that it will be obvious to every 
one that the learned author has not figured the part now described 
as an involucre ; indeed the figure in question does not represent 
the frond denuded of its scales, and consequently the real invo- 
lucre is totally concealed. I am therefore quite inclined to be- 
lieve Smith has fallen into an error, in supposing he had seen 
any involucre connected with the fructification of Ceterach. 
Roth’s description, which I have quoted below, nearly resembles 
Smith’s, and speaks of a double involucre : % it bears many

indications of being a record of real observation, and yet what 
is said of the involucre does not convey an exact idea of its 
appearance. I am not prepared to say that this very accurate 
author is wrong in thus describing a double involucre ; but 
granting that the second is an involucre, its great discrepancy 
in prominence should surely have been noticed. Willdenow, 
Swartz, Sadler and Hooker, deny the existence of an involucre 
in Ceterach^ and thus totally destroy its natural affinity wdth the 
AspleniacecB. For a long time, owing to a too hurried and su- 
perficial examination, I overlooked this important character, and 
I am indebted to Mr. Wilson for first calling my attention to its 
existence. I now fully concur in Mr. Wilson’s views as to its 
presence. Mr. White and Mr. Jenner have also kindly and zea- 
lously assisted in the enquiry with a similar result. 

Mr. Wilson considers that some of the scales which cover the 
back of the frond are ranged in a linear series on the involucre 
itself : this observation I have been unable to verify, probably 
from my want of skill in manipulation. In order to obtain a 
perfectly satisfactory view of these parts, it is not only necessary 
to obtain fronds in a very young state, even before they are 
fully unfolded, and before they have had the least opportunity 
to become dry or withered, but it is also requisite carefully to 
denude the frond of its scales, removing them one by one while 
the object is still under the glass. Whoever may hereafter take 
this trouble, will, I am persuaded, fully concur with me in as- 
signing to Ceterach a true involucre, closely resembling that so 
observable in the genus Asplenium. 

Mr. Smith, of Kew, without whose concurrence I scarcely 
feel confident of even my own observations, has favoured me 
with his views on this interesting subject. It will be seen by 
the following quotation from his letter that he has not yet

observed the involucre, but at the same time his remarks will 
show that he considers the species as belonging to the family in 
which I have placed it. “ With respect to Ceterach having an 
indusium, you will see that, according to my view, in the ‘ Jour- 
nal of Botany ’ I have placed it in Aspleniece, which tribe is 
characterized as having the sporangia produced on one or both 
sides of the veins, and furnished wdth an indusium that rises 
from the same axis, but more from the upper side (or surface as 
it may be termed) of the vein, the sporangia being in the early 
state pressed down by it, and in true Asplenium pointing in- 
wards, — that is, to the primary midrib of the segment or pin- 
nule, &c. Now although I can find no evident indusium in 
Ceterach^ yet the circumstance of the sporangia being lateral is 
of itself sufficient to induce me to consider it as belonging to 
Asplenie<By and the absence of an indusium is, in my opinion, 
owing to its being suppressed by the dense mass of scales com- 
mon to the plant. In my character of the genus Ceterach I 
have said ^ indusium obsolete,’ and although I have not seen 
anything like a membrane, still there is a thickening of the vein 
above the axis of the sporangia.”

This appears to me the most interesting of all our ferns : 
whether we regard its rarity, its beauty, its excessive susceptibility 
to injury from exposure when in cultivation, its entire absence 
from all European countries or islands, with the single excep- 
tion of Ireland, or its remarkable botanical characters, — some- 
what combining those of true ferns, mosses and seaweeds,— it 
cannot fail to be regarded with feelings of deep interest.

In texture as well as scent our British Trichomanes particu- 
larly resembles some of the marine Algce ; and I have found it 
to assume the same life-like appearance on immersion in water, 
after being kept perfectly dry for many years ; this property is 
also observable in Hymenophyllum, 

When I speak of its absence from Europe and European is- 
lands, with the single exception of Ireland, it must not be sup- 
posed that I have overlooked the record of its former occurrence 
in Yorkshire. Doubt and difficulty seem to beset this record 
on every side, yet in a work professing to be a history of Bri- 
tish Ferns, I believe it advisable to publish all the information 
that can be collected on the subject. In Bay’s ‘ Synopsis ’ we 
find a figure^ so like some of the specimens gathered near Kil- 
larney, as to have convinced all subsequent botanists that it 
was intended for the present plant : there is a second figuref 
which professes to represent the young state of the plant, but 
which not only carries with it no evidence of identity, but is so 
totally unlike the seedling plants of Trichomanes reared by 
Mr. Andrews of Dublin, that a careful observer must hesitate 
long before admitting that the two plants represented in the 
‘Synopsis’ have any connexion with each other. The plants re- 
presented in both these figures were “ found by Dr. Richardson 
at Belbank, scarce half a mile from Bingley, at the head of a 
remarkable spring, and nowhere else that he knows of.”J The 
description, quoted at length below, § seems, as far as it goes, 
tolerably applicable to the present plant; but it should be ob- 
served that neither the figure nor the description notices the 
fruit which forms so important a diagnostic of Trichomanes 
speciosiim. The second notice of this locality is in Bolton’s

‘ Filices,’ where I find the following statement appended to his 
Trichomanes pyxidiferum. — “ First discovered by Dr. Rich- 
ardson in a little dark cavern under a dripping rock, a little 
below the spring of Elm Cragg Well, in Bell Bank, scarce half 
a mile from Bingiey. In this place I saw it in plenty in the 
year 1758 : afterwards, some alterations being made about the 
well for the convenience of the proprietor, the cavern was 
destroyed, the plant perished, and was lost to Great Britain till 
the year 1782, at which time being engaged in this work, and 
passionately desirous to see the plant again in its growing state, 
after several researches in Bell Bank, I found a root under a 
dripping rock, to the left side of the current, and about fifteen 
yards above the cistern. From this root 1 have sent specimens 
to one or two of my friends, and have in my possession the best 
of them, from which this figure and description were taken. 
We have here evidence of an observant botanist rediscovering 
and republishing the locality, and expressing no doubt whatever 
that his plant was identical with Dr. Richardson’s : his figure 
and description, moreover, are cited by Smith as applicable to 
the present species ; and yet it seems to me not improbable 
that our Hymenophyllum tunhridgense was the plant which 
Bolton intended to figure and describe. In the year last men- 
tioned by Bolton (1782), a similar plant seems to have been 
observed by Mr. Teesdale, as recorded in the following passage 
from the ‘ Linnean Transactions.’ — Trichomanes pyxidiferum, 
Huds. In September, 1782, I found this rare plant in Belbank 
wood, near Bingiey, the place mentioned in R. Syn. Whether 
it be only a variety of the following \H. tunhridgense^ I leave 
to the decision of those who may have frequent opportunity of 
examining it in the place of its growth.”f From this the reader 
may, however, infer that Mr. Teesdale hesitated to consider the 
fern distinct from H, tunhridgense. Sir J. E. Smith, under his 
Trichomanes hrevisetum, after quoting Ray’s habitat, observes, 
“ Found there by Mr. Dickson and Mr. R. Teesdale long after- 
wards, in a young state, only like fig. 4 ” of Ray’s Synopsis, 
plate 3. I know not how Sir James obtained the information

that the plant so positively spoken of by Teesdale was nothing 
more than Ray’s figure 4, but presuming on his accuracy, and 
certainly being unable to refer the said figure to any known 
species of Trichomanes, we must of necessity regard Ray’s 
figure. as the authority for considering Trichomanes speciosum wi 
English plant. I have little doubt that the species called tun- 
hridgense by Bolton, Hudson and Teesdale, and described as 
common in Wales and the north of England, is the Wilsoni of 
modern nomenclature, while their pyxidiferum may be our tun- 
hridgense. I must, however, beg the reader, who is desirous of 
pursuing the subject, to consult Hudson’s specimen of this fern 
now in the British Museum, and a series of minute specimens 
in the Smithian herbarium now in possession of the Linnean 
Society. 

From this fruitless enquiry I turn to Ireland, where I have 
stood amid the roar of waters gazing on hundreds of the dark 
green fronds of this fern, as they waved to and fro in the agitated 
air, and sparkled with myriads of sun-lit drops. I am told that 
this scene is to be gazed on no more ; that all its beauties have 
been ruthlessly destroyed; and that Turk may become what 
Belbank is now, — the locality for a mere tradition. In Ireland, 
however, the plant is destined to exist ; its stations are too nu- 
merous for all of them to be destroyed, and my list — alas ! that 
it should be so — is curtailed by promises of secrecy which I was 
willing enough to make ; for when I see the devastation caused 
by directions I have formerly published, I cannot blame the spirit 
of concealment to which I allude. Notwithstanding such 
restrictions, it will, however, be seen that my list is tolerably 
comprehensive. 

Cork. — - Mr. R. Ball informs me that he found this fern in 
luxuriant profusion in Glen dine, near Youghal. It was found 
in 1841, by Mr. James A. Fisher, in Glenbour, Killeagh, also 
near the town of Youghal ; it was growing in a cave, and in 
considerable abundance, Mr. Fisher having supplied several 
botanists with whom I correspond ; but when he visited the 
cave during the subsequent year, he found that a fire had been 
kindled immediately under the spot where the fern was growing, 
and it has been by this means almost entirely destroyed. In

Temple Michael Glen, near Cork, it has been noticed by several 
botanists, but I am informed by Mr. S. P. Woodward that in 
August, 1843, there was very little left ; Mr. Woodward also in- 
forms me that at the Cork meeting of the British Association 
he saw recent specimens which had been gathered near Bandon, 
in this county. “ It was once found in Ballinhasy glen, near 
Cork.” — Francis' Analysis. 

Kerry.  — The celebrated station at Turk waterfall, near Kil- 
larney, was discovered by Mr. Mackay in 1804 ; he observed 
the plant in considerable quantity and producing fruit. This 
station has been visited subsequently by many botanists and 
tourists ; among the latter tribe I may include myself : I first 
observed it to the left of the seat whence visitors usually take 
their first view of the cascade. About fifteen yards higher up 
the stream the rocky bank on the left projects into the river; 
this projection is only to be reached by striding from stone to 
stone along the bed of the stream, which, in times of flood, as 
appeared to be the case when I w^as there, is rather an exciting 
and ticklish operation. Having reached the projection, I as- 
cended it without difficulty, by the assistance of the boughs and 
roots of trees ; and on the top is a little platform, standing on 
which I saw the bank close before my eyes robed in Trichomanes. 
It was a beautiful sight. The guide* at this waterfall, subse- 
quently to my visit, has sold pieces of the fern as a “ curiosity 
of the place ” to all visitors, until he had nearly succeeded in 
eradicating it. Captain Jones informs me that in 1826 he col- 
lected specimens two hundred yards above the waterfall. Mr. 
Wilson, and my lamented friend Mr. W. Christy, found a third 
locality in a ravine of Cromaglaun mountain. Mr. Wilson in- 
forms me that another station was known to Mr. Scott, and 
another to Miss Hutchins. Mr. Robson has subsequently found 
it higher up the stream than the station mentioned by Captain 
Jones, and that in such plenty as to procure a number of roots, 
which he has planted abundantly, not only about Killarney, but 
about Glengarriff and in Valencia Island. Although the inten^

tion in doing this is perhaps a good one — that of preserving in 
Ireland this interesting species — yet I fear it will scarcely meet 
with the approbation of botanists generally. To conclude my 
notice of the Killarney district, I may state that several botanists 
visiting that neighbourhood subsequently to the meeting of the 
British Association in 1843, found this fern in a great number 
of localities : these, however, they decline giving to the public, 
fearing lest such publication should lead to its extermination. 
Mr. S. P. Woodward informs me that Dr. Taylor has discovered 
a station at Gortagaree, between Killarney and Kenmare ; Mr, 
Moore has found it at Mount Eagle, near Dingle ; and Mr. An- 
drews at Blackstones, in Glouin Caragh : for Kerry specimens 
and much valuable information respecting them, 1 am indebted 
to Mr. Andrews, Mr. Foote, Mr. Ogilby, Mr. Mackay, Mr. Moore, 
Mr. Dennes and Mr. Pamplin. Mr. Andrews and Mr. Foote 
were travelling in company, when the former discovered the 
Blackstones locality. “ It was growing in a wild and romantic 
cave, the rocky walls of which had been for ages covered with 
a drapery of the overlapping fronds, hundreds of which, hanging 
gracefully down, formed a pendulous mass of the loveliest green, 
which contrasted strikingly with the sombre hue of the Killar- 
ney plant : the rhizomata, spread over the moist surface of the 
rock, formed a reticulated and tenacious covering.” These 
gentlemen left it in all its beauty for other visitors, who, like 
themselves, might hold such a scene as too beautiful for destruc- 
tion, but alas ! their example has been unheeded. Mr. Andrews 
continues, in September last a ruthless botanical pirate, who 
discovered the spot, tore the ferns from their retreat, and frac- 
tured the hard surface of the rock, that not a vestige of the 
plant might again rear itself.” 

Wicklow. — I am informed by Mr. W. Thompson that, ac- 
cording to the MSS. of the late Mr. Templeton, this fern was 
first found in Ireland by Dr. Whitley Stokes, at Powerscourt 
waterfall, in this county : at no time did it exist here in any 
quantity. Mr. Mackay informs me he has seen a single plant 
here as well as at Hermitage glen, also in this county, where it 
was first found by Mr. Nuttal. I believe many years have elapsed 
since any botanist has found it in this locality. 


BRISTLE FERN.

There is a good figure of this fern in Hooker’s ‘ Flora Londi- 
nensis,* under the name of Trichomanes alalum ; and another 
in ‘ English Botany ,’f under that of Hymenophyllum alatum. 

It has already been stated that this plant is supposed to be 
Filix humilis repens of Ray’s ‘ Synopsis.’ Passing over the 
synonyms of Hudson, Bolton, Withering, and Berkenhout, which, 
although usually supposed to be intended for the present plant, 
must be received with doubt, we come to the description by Brown 
in the ‘ Hortus Kewensis,’J who considered the species new, 
and gave it the name of Trichomanes hrevisetum, which has 
been adopted by most modern botanists. Smith, in Rees’ 

‘ Cyclopaedia,’^ described it as Trichomanes europcBum ; and 
Sprengel, in his ‘ Sy sterna Yegetabilium,’|| as Trichomanes hiber- 
nicum. In preparing this work for the press, I endeavoured, 
but without success, to find characters by which to distinguish 
it from the well-known Trichomanes speciosum of Willdenow, 
an inhabitant of Madeira, Teneriffe, &c., some beautiful speci- 
mens of which had been recently brought to England by my 
late lamented friend Mr. William Christy. Believing the Irish 
and Madeira plants to be identical as species, I consulted my 
kind adviser, the late Professor Don, and he quite agreed w'ith 
me in the propriety of restoring Willdenow’s name ; since wdiich 
the authors of the ‘ Edinburgh Catalogue,’ and Mr. Babington 
in his ‘ Manual,’ have followed my example, but Sir W. Hooker 
retains the name of T. brevisetum.% Willdenow’s description 
is quoted below,^* in order that those who may not happen to

possess his ^ Species Plantarum ’ may have an opportunity ol 
comparing it with the plant. 

The roots of Trichomanes speciosum., as well as the rhizoma, 
a good deal resemble those of Polypodium vulgare : the rhi- 
zoma is black, tomentose, tough, and remarkably long : I have 
collected specimens which must have been many yards in 
length, and I observed these rhizomata formed a kind of net- 
work over the surface of a rock, to which the roots were slightly 
adhering : this I found to be a character of the plant when most 
luxuriant, but I discovered other smaller plants possessing more 
root and less rhizoma, and having the roots fixed in a thin layer 
of moist earth, among a profusion of moss and Hymenophyllum, 
“ The formation of the young frond takes place about May ; the 
stem then gradually lengthens, without much development of 
the circinate character of the frond till September, when a more 
rapid growth takes place ; about November the full length of 
the stem is attained, but the pinnules are not perfectly formed, 
nor has the frond attained its full development until the autumn 
of the second year : no disposition to bear fruit is shown until 
the autumn of the third year, when the involucres appear, and 
the setae and capsules attain maturity in October. It is very 
rarely that the seed attains maturity in this country : the cap- 
sules are formed within the involucres around the setae, but do 
not attain sufficient ripeness and elasticity to burst and discharge 
the seeds.” Mr. Andrews, from whose letters this description is 
copied almost in his own words, believes that in Ireland the 
seeds are only matured in dry and warm seasons ; and he adds 
that when the fronds are in a moist situation, and do not fruit, 
they wdll preserve their evergreen verdure for many years, but 
when they fructify in perfection, at the third year, the pinnules 
assume a brown withered appearance, and the entire frond 
evinces symptoms of incipient decay. The tomentose covering 
of the rhizoma is found, under a lens of high power, to consist 
of articulated bristles, which are evidently analogous to the 
scales on the stems of other ferns : they may be seen most 
abundantly on the young frond before it has unrolled, and may 
be found scattered here and there on the stem after the frond 
has attained maturity : they are of a rich brown colour, the

dilated portions being slightly transparent. I have attempted 
to show the structure of these bristles in the figure which I have 
introduced in the margin. Inter- 
mixed with these bristles are others 
much finer, much shorter, and more 
transparent ; and these, under a lens 
of sufiicient power, are also found 
to exhibit traces of articulation. 

The tomentose appearance of the 
roots is due to these minute bristles. 

The form of the fronds is be- 
tween lanceolate and triangular, 
those from Glouin Caragh approach- 
ing the former, those from Kil- 
larney the latter form. They are pinnate, the pinnae being- 
alternate and pinnate, and the pinnules deeply divided or pin- 
natifid. Perhaps it would be more correct to describe the hard, 
wiry, stem-like veins, as thus divided, and to say that each of 
these veins is furnished on each side with a semi-membranous 
wing extending throughout its length, for this is really the case 
in all the Hym€nop1iyllace(B that I have examined : the entire 
frond is composed of these wings, and consequently all its divi- 
sions are narrow and linear. This wing extends also to the 
stem, which is about equal to half the frond in length. 

The fructification may be thus described : the cluster of cap- 
sules is small and nearly spherical, and is attached to the centre 
of a vein after its ultimate division : at the point of attachment 
the wing partially loses its green and semi-membranous ap- 
pearance, becomes more opaque and of a whitish colour, and 
assumes a form something like that of a champagne-glass around 
the cluster of capsules ; the cap suliferous vein passes through 
this cup, and projects beyond it, often exceeding it four times in 
length. It is the general custom of botanists to speak of the 
cup as an involucre^ and of the bristle-like exserted vein as a 
receptacle. 

It has been lately supposed by many excellent botanists that 
there are two Irish species of Trichomanes , — the Killarney and 
the Glouin Caragh plants : I will now proceed to lay before my 


314 


HYMENOPHYLLACE^. 


readers all the information T can collect on the subject, and then 
allow them to draw their own conclusions. The first notice 1 find 
of the Glouin Caragh plant is by Mr. Mackay, at the December 
meeting of the Dublin Natural-History Society in 1842. “ Mr. 

Mackay, of the College Botanic Garden, in commenting on the 
beautiful specimens of Trichomanes exhibited by Mr. Andrews 
this evening, and on their finely developed state of fructification, 
observed that the first discovery of this rare and beautiful fern 
in Ireland was made by him in 1804, about which time he for- 
warded specimens to Sir Edward Smith, who figured it in the 
‘ English Botany,’ under the name of Hymenophyllwn alatum, 
from its winged stem. There was also exhibited before the 
meeting a true specimen of the Madeira plant, T. speciosum of 
Willdenow, which the late Right Hon. George Knox had brought 
to him in 1811 : this plant, in the short state of its receptacles, 
its triangular-shaped frond, and its densely tripinnate pinnae, 
was identical with the beautiful specimens in such fine fructifi- 
cation now before them of the T, hrevisetum of Killarney. The 
other specimens were those of a discovery made by Mr. Andrews 
this autumn, in a district remote from Killarney, and he con- 
fessed that he had never before seen such, either from their 
large size, or from the splendid state of fruit they exhibited. 
There was another peculiar, and, he considered, distinctive, fea- 
ture in the lanceolate form that all the fronds possessed, the bi- 
pinnate and not crowded state of the pinnge, and the still more 
remarkable character shown, that of the receptacles being five, 
and even six times longer than the indusia. These distinctions 
(from his own long experience and knowledge of these beautiful 
ferns, having succeeded for many years in cultivating them to 
perfection under glass in the conservatory), led him to state that 
he conceived the specimens produced by Mr. Andrews to be 
perfectly distinct from T, hrevisetum T 

The next notice I find on this subject is in the report of the 
late meeting of the British Association, held at Cork, in August, 
1843. It appears that Dr. Allman on this occasion exhibited 
specimens of the Glouin Caragh plant, calling attention to the 
characters already pointed out ; and that Mr. Mackay again 
expressed “ his conviction that it was a new species.” 




BRISTLE FERN.

Mr. Andrews has obligingly furnished me with the following 
characters of the two plants. The first I will call 



Trichomanes specioswn var. Andrewsii, ^ 
(natural size). 


Trichomanes 


^ Frond lanceolate 


twice pinnated, lower pinnae distant short, 
ultimate segments of the pinnae decurrent serrated 
lobed linear acute. Rachis winged, very long. Re- 
ceptacles six times longer than the involucra. Root 
long scarcely tomentose. Habitat, moist rocky cave, 
Glouin Caragh, Kerry. 


316 


HYMENOPHYLLACE^. 


Trichomanes speciosum. Frond angular thrice pinnated, 
lowest pinnae longest densely crowded and tripinnated, lobes of 
the pinnae linear blunt. K-achis winged, short. Receptacles two 
or three times longer than the involucra. Root thick densely 
tomentose. Habitat, Turk, Killarney ; Glouin Caragh ; Mount 
Eagle, Kerry.” 

Mr. Andrews further observes, that ‘Hhe striking character of 
the Glouin Caragh plant is the amazing length of the recepta- 
cles, which, in the growing state 
of the plant, turn up from the 
involucra in a curved manner,* 
[see figure in the margin] show- 
ing a most bristly appearance 
over the entire frond : all the 
fronds presented the lanceolate 
character, the lower pinnae be- 
ing distant and short ; the ul- 
timate segments of all the pinnae are serrated, the pinnules being 
decurrent and running to a point ; the entire length of the frond 
was sixteen inches, and from the base of the lowest pinnae to 
the apex of the frond eleven inches.” 

In opposition to the views expressed by these three eminent 
botanists, I will cite that of Mr. Moore, who says, “ I think the 
new Trichomanes to be nothing more than the old plant fully 
developed, and more attenuated in all its parts, and that this is 
caused by the dark warm habitat in which it grew. In order to 
prove whether the old plant could not be altered by being sub- 
jected to a different kind of treatment, I had a good healthy pot 
placed under the stage of a green-house, where it got very little 
light, and over the glass a piece of old carpet was thrown which 
was kept constantly saturated with water, so that I considered 
the plant placed nearly in a similar position to that in which 
the new plant was found. I soon found that the fronds might 
be lengthened to an almost incredible extent, and that they be- 
came more simple in their appearance ; in both these respects 
well agreeing with the plant discovered by Mr. Andrews.” No 
fruit has been produced, so that it remains a question whether 
the receptacle also can be elongated by this treatment. Mr. 



BRISTLE FERN. 


317 


Ogilby, of Dublin, whose name I hav^e before mentioned as a 
kind contributor of specimens, seems quite to coincide in Mr. 
Moore’s view of the case. 

In accordance with the views previously urged, when describ- 
ing Cystopteris fragilis and Lastrcea multiflora^ I have en- 
deavoured to compare the most mature and perfect fronds from 
each locality, and the result appears to be 1st — that the speci- 
mens from Glouin Caragh are far more mature and fruitful than 
those from Killarney ; it is a rare thing to obtain specimens from 
the latter station in a thoroughly mature state ; I think I may 
say that not one frond in fifty exhibits involucres, and not one 
in many hundreds attains the perfect development and fruitful- 
ness displayed by the Glouin Caragh plant ; but 2ndly — I find 
that the most mature of the Killarney specimens most recede 
from the Glouin Caragh specimens, a circumstance rather op- 
posed to the supposition that the two are identical, since in 
general we find ferns developing their specific dififerences more 
strikingly as they approach perfection. 3rdly — The length of 
receptacle is another test of perfection : the Killarney plant, 
grown at Killarney, has a receptacle of very different length ; 
in the most perfect specimens it is at least four times as long as 
the involucre, in the least perfect it scarcely protrudes beyond 
the involucre, and under cultivation it is seldom to be seen at 
all, thus evidently proclaiming that its length in some measure 
depends on health, maturity, and a congenial situation. Will- 
denow, in the passage cited, describes the receptacle as four 
times the length of the involucre ; and I cannot assert either 
that its frequent departure from this character at Killarney 
proves anything more than that such departure is a testimony 
of imperfection, or its attaining this character at Glouin Caragh 
is to be attributed to any other causes than congenial situation. 
The form of frond may be capable, as Mr. Moore asserts, of 
great elongation, but there is no evidence that the relative length 
of the pinnae is also altered : it appears to be a fundamental 
character of a deltoid frond that the lowest pair of pinnae shall 
be longer than the second pair, the second longer than the third, 
and so on ; and, as far as I am aware, this character is Constantin 
cultivation ; at least I can safely assert that it is so in Asplenium 


318 


HYMENOPHYLLACE^. 


Adiantum-nigrum^ Lastrcea reciirva, &c. The apex of the frond 
is often lengthened very remarkably, but the lower pinnse almost 
invariably partake of a similar elongation. In lanceolate fronds, 
the lowest pair of pinnse are usually shorter than the second 
pair, the second shorter than the third ; and this character in 
Asplenium lanceolatum^ Lastrcea multijlora^ &c., remains unal- 
tered under any condition. Now the two Trichomanes, although 
less decidedly deltoid or lanceolate than the ferns I have cited, 
follow the same law, each preserving respectively its deltoid or 
lanceolate tendency under cultivation. 

Again there is a decided difference, as far as I can learn from my 
limited materials, in the involucres of the two plants. In the 
Killarney plant the involucre stands out distinctly from the mem- 
branous frond, and appears almost stalked, while in all my spe- 
cimens of the Glouin Caragh plant it is more or less united with j 
the frond by a continuous margin or wing ; this will perhaps 
become more evident from an inspection of the figures at page > 
320, which fairly express the differences observable in my spe- 
cimens from each station. Supposing that the deltoid and lan- 
ceolate fronds are constant in each plant, and that the exserted 
and partially imbedded involucres are also constant, I think | 
there can be little doubt that Mr. Andrews’s plant claims the rank ' 
of a species ; the extraordinary length of the receptacle, the less | 
divided state of the frond, and the less tomentose rhizoma, so 
ably pointed out by the Irish botanists, will furnish additional 
support of such a decision, although I scarcely like to take j 
either of these as a specific character. Still I hesitate to add a | 
species to our British Ferns unless possessed of more ample 
means for forming an opinion ; and I give to the plant the name 
of Andrewsii as a variety only, respectfully begging of subse- ’ 
quent describers, that snould their views coincide with mine, 
they will still allow the plant to bear the name of a naturalist 
to whose ardour and intelligence the science of Botany is under 
so many and such important obligations. i 

The cultivation of this beautiful fern has occupied the atten- ) 
tion of many botanists : I believe Mr. Mackay of Dublin, and | 
Mr. Ward of London, were the first whose efforts were attended ij 
with success. Mr. Ward possesses a plant which for many 'j 

k 

'I 


BRISTLE FERN. 


319 


years has been in the most healthy and vigorous condition, but 
it has rarely shown any indication of producing seed. Mr. An- 
drews appears to have been still more successful : he says, in 
September, 1841, I formed a case purposely for cultivating this 
fern. I lined the bottom with zinc, and covered the frame-work 
with oiled lawn. I then planted my specimens in w^ell-drained 
pots, in a compost of loam and coarse sand, interspersed with 
pieces of turf. I also suspended the roots [rhizomata] across 
the roof of the case, attached to rods covered with bass-matting 
and moss. The plants were kept cool, and were well moistened 
daily, and I have now (Oct. 24, 1843) a splendid display, the 
entire case being filled with fronds of large and strong growth. 
No other fern will thrive well in the case with the Trichomanes, 
the treatment required to cause the Trichomanes to flourish 
being destructive to the other. The Trichomanes will live or 
even grow lazily in a glass with other ferns, but will never attain 
a vigorous state of growth. The cultivators of Trichomanes 
are under a mistake in supposing that the plant was in a fine 
state of fructification, merely because the involucra had been 
produced. I have never seen the setse perfectly exserted in 
cultivation, and the capsules attached in a ripening state. It 
was late in September when I discovered the Glouin Caragh 
plant, and I collected a quantity of the capsules, but I could not 
detect the sporidia thrown out by the bursting of the ring of 
the capsules. I scattered the capsules on well-moistened pieces 
of turf, on patches of growing mosses, and on a compost of 
loam and sand : after a lapse of 
four months those on the turf and 
moss became green, gelatinous 
masses ; at the end of eight 
months they became of a lively 
green colour, and had much the 
appearance of a Jungermannia^ 
cellular and beautifully reticu- 
lated; and now, at the end of 
twelve months, they have sent out a wiry and rigid rachis, with 
an attempt at the formation of pinnules. 1 send you rough 
sketches of them.” [See the figures in the margin.]

HYMENOPHYLLACEiE. 


The genus Trichomanes, as restricted by Sir J. E. Smith and 
nearly all modern botanists, appears to depend on “ the cover ” 
consisting “ of one leaf,” and the capillary point of the recep- 
tacle projecting ^‘beyond the cover.” The value of the first of 
these characters appears to me very slight, for it is impossible 
to look at one of the involucres of the present fern without im- 
mediately perceiving that it is composed of two equal parts, 
united by an incrassated suture, which is accompanied through- 
out its length by an external margin or wing ; this is very slen- 
der, and almost obsolete in the Madeira and Killarney plants, 
as already noticed, but strikingly developed in the Glouin Ca- 
ragh plant, as well as in the closely-allied West-Indian Tricho- 
manes alatum^ and several other cognate species. Of the figures 
introduced below, a represents the usual and scarcely varying 
appearance of the Killarney plant, while 5, c, d and e represent 
different states of the Glouin Caragh plant. The other charac- 
ter, the relative length of the involucre and receptacle, seems 
very fallacious, since the development, and even the presence of 
the latter, is very uncertain and irregular.

Hymenophyllum tunbridgense, Smith. 

The little moss-like ferns which constitute the genus Hyme- 
nophyllum are found growing on the surface of rocks and stones, 
in moist and shady situations. Unfortunately in my endeavours 
to draw up a summary of habitats, I can derive but little assis- 
tance from the ‘ Botanist’s Guide,’ since its learned authors do 
not distinguish between the species, but treat them both as one ; 
and, therefore, a doubt must attach to the species found in the 
localities which I have quoted from that work. The other Eng- 
lish and Welch habitats of H. tunhridgense have been supplied 
by correspondents on whom I can confidently rely. 

Cornwall. — Mr. Babington and Mr. Borrer inform me they 
have found this species at Rough tor, near Camelford ; Miss 
Warren in two places in a wood near Penryn ; and Mr. Peirson 
at College wood, near Penryn. 

Cheshire. — On mossy rocks near Croyden brook, the east-

bridge; and Miss Griffiths has observed it at Bishleigh vale, 
South Devon. 

Glamorganshire. — Mr. Westcombe informs me he found it 
at the Melincourt waterfall : it may be added that one of the 
species — but I cannot satisfactorily ascertain which of them — 
occurs abundantly at Pont Nedd Vechn. 

Kent. — Just within the limits of the county, at Tunbridge 
Wells. 

Lancashire. — Mr. S. Gibson has found it at Cliviger ; Mr. 
Sidebotham sparingly in caves at Greenfield ; and Mr. Simpson 
near Coniston. 

Merionethshire. — Mr. Wilson informs me he has received 
specimens from Crofnant, near Harlech ; Mr. Ralfs that he has 
found it near Dolgelly, and near Barmouth ; and Mr. H. C. 
Rothery in the vale of Festiniog. 

Somersetshire. — ^In Sole’s MS. Flora of Somersetshire, it is 
said to grow in a shady lane near Shipton Mallett. 

Sussex. — “ Mr. Dare found it near Tunbridge ; found also 
plentifully by Mr. Rand, in company with Mr. Sherard, amongst 
the pebbles at Cockbush, six or seven miles from Chichester, in 
the county of Sussex.” — Ray's Synopsis. Mr. Borrer informs 
me it occurs in the crevices and on the perpendicular sides of 
sand rocks about Tunbridge Wells, West Hoathly, Ardingley 
and Handcross. Mr. Jenner speaks of its occurrence here and 
there on the sand rocks throughout the county. 

Yorkshire. — Mr. Spruce informs me it has been found by 
Mr. Peterkin on rocks by a stream running down to the sea, at 
a place called Hayburn-wyke, near Whitby ; Mr. Wilson has 
found it near Halifax, and near Greenfield ; and Mr. S. Gibson 
near Todmorden. 

In Scotland this pretty little fern does not appear of common 
occurrence : the following habitats have been kindly supplied me.

Dumfriesshire. — Mr. Cruickshank has found it on rocks at 
Drumlanrigg bridge. 

In Ireland this fern is not generally distributed, being con- 
fined to those romantic parts of a few counties which have for 
many years attracted the notice of tourists. 

Kerry. — In the vicinity of Killarney it attains a degree of 
luxuriance and profusion that I have never observed elsewhere : 
it is almost invariably intermixed with Wilsoni, and sometimes 
also with Trichomanes speciosum : it not only covers the rocks, 
but even clings to the bark of trees, ascending them to a height 
of two or three feet, and presenting a very beautiful appearance. 

Wicklow. — Mr. Mackay informs me it occurs at Powerscourt 
waterfall, Glencree, and several other places in this county. 

A species of Hymenophyllum occurs under the name of tun- 
hridgense in the Floras of Germany, France, Italy and Sweden. 
From the ‘ Flore Frangaise ’ we learn that in France it grows 
amongst moss on the trunks of trees ; and a closely-allied spe- 
cies, often indeed bearing the same name, has been received 
from New Holland, South Africa, and South America. 

The figure of this fern in Sowerby’s ^English Botany ’ ^ is 
sufficiently exact, and that in Hooker’s ‘ Flora Londinensis ’ f 
is still better. The figure in Bolton’s ^ Filices ’ X appears to be 
drawn from the next species. 

This plant is the Trichomanes tunhridgense of Linneus,§ 
Hudson, II and many of our earlier authors : it was separated by 
Smith as a genus in the fifth volume of the Turin Transactions,^! 
and the name has been adopted by nearly all subsequent bota- 
nists, a strong proof of the weight of Smith’s authority, for even 
now, when generic subdivision has extended to so great a length, 
we have no new genera founded on such imaginary differen- 
ces as those which separate Hymenophyllum from Trichomanes, 
In my endeavours to draw a line between these genera I have 
been totally unsuccessful : if we regard the exserted receptacle 
of the one, or the bivalved involucre of the other, the only con- 
clusion at which we can arrive is this — that those species with

the longest receptacles at present stand in Trichomanes, those 
with the most distinctly bivalved involucres in Hymenophyllum. 
These, however, are mere questions of degree, and are quite in- 
sufficient to guide the botanist who — without a prior knowledge 
of a plant — seeks, by means of books, to ascertain its generic 
and specific names. It must not, however, be understood that 
I object to the subdivision of the Linnean genus Trichomanes ; 
so far from this, I trust the time is not far distant when some 
competent botanist shall rearrange the entire group, pointing out 
characters that admit of no dispute, and leading us on to a far 
more accurate knowledge of these beautiful plants than we can 
hope to glean from any works yet before the public. 

The roots are black, wiry, and very slender ; the rhizoma 
long, black, slender, wiry and creeping. The fronds consist of 
branched series of veins, each being clothed with a membranous 
or filmy wing, the structure in this respect being exactly similar 
to that of Trichomanes ; the branches or pinnae are alternate, 
and each is more or less subdivided ; the divisions or pinnules 
are mostly in pairs ; the margin of the wing is crenate or 
denticulate. The clusters of capsules are nearly round, and 
each is seated almost at the extremity of a short vein, which in 
each pinna is next adjoining the midrib of the frond. The 
wing, or membranous portion of the frond, is divided below the 
cluster of capsules, and encloses it as in a kind of cup, which is 
usually called the involucre : the upper margin of this involucre 
is notched and uneven ; the capsuliferous vein or receptacle 
does not extend beyond the margin of the involucre. In exotic 
species, scarcely distinguishable in other respects, the involucre 
is discernible just beyond the margin, and such species are con- 
sequently allowed to retain the Linnean name of Trichomanes.

Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, Hooker. 

The range of this species in Great Britain appears to be much 
more extensive than that of H. tunhridgense : it also seems 
to be a more northern species, and generally to prefer a 
greater elevation : still, as already stated, the two plants are 
often intermixed, particularly about the waterfalls in the vicinity 
of Killarney. The following are some of the principal English 
and Welch stations. 

Brecknockshire. — Mr. Ralfs informs me it is common 
among the mountains in this county. 

Caernarvonshire. — As far as I am able to decide I should 
say that the habitats at Snowdon, Llanberis, Cwm Idwell, Nant- 
frangon, &c., although generally accompanied by the name of 
tunhridgense., belong exclusively to the present species. I for- 
merly supposed I had found tunhridgense in Caernarvonshire, 
but, on referring to the specimens, can only find the present 
species, which is most abundant on rocks and stones throughout 
the Snowdon district, at Rhaiadr-y-Wenol, Falls of the Lugwy, 
Capel Cerig, Rhaiadr-Mawr near Llanberis, &c. 

Cardiganshire. — Mr. Lees has observed it in some quantity 
on rocks close to Pont Bren, or the Parson’s bridge.

Cornwall. — Miss Warren has found it at Granite tor ; Mr. 
Ralfs and Mr. Greenwood at Cam Brea, near Redruth ; Mr. 
Babington and Mr. Borrer in abundance at Rough tor, near 
Camelford. 

Cumberland. — Mr. Watson gives me Scale-force as a locality ; 
Mr. Finder speaks of it as of common occurrence on the rocks 
and screes ; in addition to Scale-force, he mentions Scaw-fell, 
High-still, Honister-crag, Gatesgarth-dale, Borrowdale, &c. 

Devonshire. — The Rev. W. S. Here and Mr. Ward inform 
me it occurs in company with H. tunbridgense, on rocks and 
large blocks of granite adjoining the Plym, above Shaugh bridge, 
and Mr. Here adds, in much greater abundance at Westman’s 
wood, Dartmoor ; Mr. Ralfs and Mr. Borrer have also found it 
on ravines at Dartmoor ; and Miss Griffiths at Tynemouth, 
North Devon, and Bishleigh wood. South Devon. 

Lancashire. — Miss Beever and Mr. Finder have found it on 
the Old-man mountain ; Mi*. Sidebotham sparingly in caves at 
Greenfield ; Mr. Simpson commonly near Lancaster ; Dr. Wood 
on hills near Bury ; and Mr. S. Gibson at The villy, near Burnley. 

Merionethshire. — I have observed it in abundance at 
Rhaidr Du near Maentwrog, and at Rhaidr-y-Mawddach near 
Llaneltyd ; and Mr. H. C. Rothery found it, in company with 
H. iunhridgense, in the vale of Festiniog. 

Staffordshire. — Mr. Garner, in his ^ Natural History of 
Staffordshire,’ states that it has been found in the clefts of rocks 
at Gradbitch, near Flash. 

Westmoreland. — Mr. Bowerbank observed it on Ambleside ; 
Miss Beever has found it at Stock gill and Dungeon gill ; and 
Mr. Finder speaks of it as not uncommon in the county. 

Yorkshire.   — Mr. Gibson informs me he has found it at 
Turner’s dough, seven miles from Halifax, on the Oldham road ; 
Mr. J. Backhouse, jun., on rocks near Lower Harrogate ; and 
Mr. Wilson near Greenfield. 

In Scotland this species is more abundant than the preceding. 

Argyleshire. — Mr. Babington has met with it at Crinnan, 
and Mr. Adamson at Dunoon. 

Dumbartonshire. — Mr. Gourlie has met with it abundantly 
on rocks on the banks of Loch Lomond.

Dumfriesshire. — It has been found by Mr. Babington and 
Mr. Cruickshank in Girpel lane, Kirkpatrick juxta. 

Perthshire. — Mr. Gourlie and many other botanists have 
found it on Ben Lawers. 

Renfrewshire. — Mr. Gourlie has found it on rocks and hills 
above Gourock. 

Shetland Isles. — Mr. Edmonston says, I have observed it 
in one place overhanging a subalpine stream near Ska, Unst, in 
great luxuriance and abundance.” 

In Ireland this fern is much more common than in England, 
and grows with a beauty and luxuriance that I have not wit- 
nessed elsewhere : it is more generally distributed over the 
island than tunhridgense, I subjoin a few localities. 

Antrim. — Mr. W. Thompson thinks that this is the species 
noticed in Mr. Templeton’s MSS., under the name of H, tun- 
hridgense, as having been found by him in Colin glen, near 
Belfast : at the time the record was made the name tunhridgense 
was applied to both species. Mr. Templeton also found it by 
the Glenarve river, near Cushendall. 

Cork. — ^Abundant in the glens near Youghal. 

Donegal. — Mr. Templeton found a Hymenophyllum on the 
Ennishowen mountains, which Mr. W. Thompson believes to 
be this species. 

Down. — Mr. W. Thompson informs me he has collected this 
species in Tullamore park, and on the Mourne mountains. 

Fermanagh. — Mr. W. Thompson informs me that the Hon. 
J. L. Cole has found this species near Florence court.

H. timh'idgense, it having been found in the most distant parts 
of the globe : Europe, Africa, New Holland, and South America. 

There is a very good figure of this fern in Sowerby’s ‘ Eng- 
lish Botany.’^ 

With respect to the name, British authors seem agreed in 
calling it H, Wilsoni ; but, numerous as are our descriptions, 
not one appears to me to describe the plant so accurately 
as that by Willdenow of H. unilaterale : this I have quoted 
below,t and I think few botanists will hesitate in deciding that 
it was intended for a species very similar to our H. Wilsoni, I 
have never seen authentic specimens of Willdenow’s plant, and 
therefore fear to adopt the name ; moreover, Willdenow does 
not mention his unilaterale as an inhabitant of Europe. The 
subject is, however, well worth investigation ; for, much as I 
honor the name of Wilson, I should not hesitate to adopt the 
prior name could it be established that the species were identical. 

The species as British was first distinguished from the preceding 
by Mr. Wilson, who, in a letter to me, observes, I have had 
considerable difficulty from the very first in procuring for Hy- 
menophyllum Wilsoni an exact description : the pinnae are not 
pinnatifid, as in H. tunhridgense, but more properly of a lobed 
or triangular form (rhomboid in the other species). It may per- 
haps aid the illustration to say that H, tunbridgense has the 
pinna with a central axis, while nothing of the sort can be de- 
dected in H. Wilsoni ; and that if you were to cut away the 
outer half of the pinna of H. tunbridgense you would then 
reduce it to the shape of H. Wilsoni. By this character the 
species may be recognised in a barren state.” The first

description of H. Wilsoni is from the pen of Sir W. Hooker. 
He describes it thus, ‘‘ Fronds rigid pinnate, pinnae recurved 
subunilateral wedge-shaped and 4 — 6 lobed, the segments linear 
undivided or bifid spinuloso-serrate, involucres axillary solitary 
ovate inflated entire, rachis only slightly margined towards the 
extremity ; ” * and he distinguishes it from H. tunhridgense in 
the following manner, More rigid and with larger reticulations 
than the last, quite distinct in its mode of growth, for all the 
pinnae are strongly curved backwards in a direction contrary to 
that of the fructification, the involucre is totally different larger 
browner of a more rigid texture truly ovate, each valve remark- 
ably convex for its whole length, the edges only of the valves 
being applied to each other, and they are quite entire.”f 

The roots and rhizoma of Wilsoni offer no characters by 
which 1 can .distinguish them from those of tunhridgense ; the 
fronds of both are circinate ; they make their appearance late 
in the summer months, and usually remain green through the 
winter, turning completely black in the ensuing spring. 

The frond consists of branched veins, clothed with a mem- 
branous wing, the margin of the wings being serrated : the wing 
on the main stem is less apparent in Wilsoni than in tunhrid- 
gense ; the pinnse are alv/ays convex above, while those of tun- 
hridgense are usually flat : Wilsoni has a more erect habit, 
tunhridgense a more horizontal, and, indeed, somewhat drooping, 
so that, on the trunk of a tree, the fronds seem to rest one on 
another like the tiles of a house. The involucre is very different 
from that of tunhridgense ; it is elongate, swollen at the base, 
and its exterior margin perfectly without serratures : when the 
capsules are mature, the involucre opens at the top, and, split- 
ting down the middle, remains widely gaping. 

A comparison of the two illustrations, which are drawn with 
considerable care, will enable the botanist to form a more cor- 
rect idea of the difference between them than I am able to 
convey by any description : they are of the natural size, the 
detached pinna of each being magnified.

SO long considered identical, as the two British Hymenophylla, 
we are bound to exercise the greatest caution, as well as candour. 
We must on no account draw our conclusions from mere appear- 
ances, — from isolated or ill-established facts, — or from assertions 
made either at random or by incompetent observers. I have 
peeled the matted rhizomata of these ferns from the rocks about 
Killarney, — have sat me down on the trunk of a fallen Arbutus, 
— have taken the mass of Hymenophyllum on my knees, and 
have carefully endeavoured to disentangle the tortuous wiry rhi- 
zomata of the two species. I have found every appearance in 
favor of the supposition that both forms of frond were produced 
by a single plant : the mat or carpet before me has appeared 
principally to consist of tunhridgense, but in every part rose the 
more erect fronds of Wilsoni, with their unilateral and secund 
pinnce : still the evidence of continuity between the rhizoma 
that produced one form, and that which produced another, was 
always wanting ; and on the same rhizoma, however carefully 
disentangled, I never found the two forms of frond. Candour 
also is essentially requisite : we must allow no theory, no previ- 
ously conceived idea, no dictum of the learned, to influence us 
in what is simply an enquiry after truth. The opinion of a Lin- 
neus, a Willdenow, or a John Smith, may raise, but cannot solve, 
a question of this kind. The test to which I have before had 
recourse — that of comparison in the most perfect or fruitful 
state — yields its evidence in favor of the two forms being dis- 
tinct as species. I have already observed that the great diffe- 
rence between them exists in the fructification, and I may also 
add that the more mature, the more perfect, the more fruitful the 
specimens, the greater are the discrepancies they exhibit, and the 
more decidedly and strikingly do they recede from each other.

OsMUNDA REGALis, Liiineus. 

This noble fern is so generally distributed over the British 
Islands that I forbear from publishing the immense list of loca- 
lities with which 1 have been furnished through the kindness of 
correspondents. In Ireland, particularly in Connaught, it is 
most abundant : in Cunnemara I have often observed it covering 
the small islands in the lakes with a dense mass of its luxuriant 
fronds, those in the centre being more erect, those round the 
margins more pendulous. Of the pendulous habit I noticed a 
beautiful instance at Killarney, where it completely fringes the 
river between the lakes, and certainly forms a most prominent 
feature in that lovely but neglected portion of Killarney’s far- 
famed scenery. So altered is the usual character of this fern, 
that its long fronds arch gracefully over, and dip their masses 
of seed in the crystal water, while the saucy coots, from beneath 
the canopy it affords them, gaze fearlessly on the visitors who 
are continually passing by. One of the boatmen employed by 
Sir Walter Scott, on the occasion of his visit to Killarney, told 
me that Sir Walter scarcely uttered a syllable in praise of the 
scenery until he came to this spot ; and here he stopped the 
rowers, and exclaimed, “ This is worth coming to see 1 ” The 
boatman evidently thought very meanly of Sir Walter’s opinion, 
whom he considered in duty bound to be in raptures with the 
lakes and mountains. I do not wonder at the great man’s taste : 
to me it appeared the most wonderfully beautiful spot I had 
ever beheld, and this beauty is mainly owing to the immense 
size and number of these pendant fronds. In the Island of 
Achill it often fringes the little streams which descend from tlie 
mountains, rarely however rising above -their water- worn chan- 
nels, and thus escaping the violence of the mountain winds : in 
a sheltered farm in the possession of Mr. Long it has forsaken 
these water- courses and established itself in the fields, where he 
found it a troublesome weed, and very difficult to eradicate. I 
was amused to see it towering over his cabbages and potatoes, 
and intermixed with his oats and wheat. In Scotland this beau- 
tiful plant is also common, and often grows to a gigantic size :

on the banks of Loch Fyne, where its habit is comparatively 
rigid and erect, as represented in the accompanying figure, I 
have measured fronds eight feet 
in length. In the bogs of Lan- 
cashire it is abundant but less 
luxuriant, and it occurs not 
uncommonly in all the northern 
counties of England ; it is also 
of frequent occurrence in North 
and South Wales, Cornwall and 
Devonshire, and is scattered in 
hundreds of localities through- 
out the southern counties ap- 
proaching the vicinity of Lon- 
don, on Epping forest, and 
Keston heath. 

Gerarde says “ it groweth in 
the midst of a bog at the fur- 
ther end of Hampsted heath 
from London, at the bottome 
of a hill, adjoyning to a small 
cottage, and in divers other pla- 
ces, as also vpon divers bogges 
on a heath or a common neere 
vntoBruntwoodin Essex, espe- 
cially neere vnto a place there 
that some have digged to the 
end to finde a nest or mine of 
gold ; but the birds were ouer 
fledge, and flowne away before 
their wings could be clipped.”'^ 

In the eastern and midland 
counties it may be considered 
more rare. The following remarks on the distribution of Os- 
munda regalis are from the pen of Mr. Watson. “ Here the 
distribution of an order is that of a single species only, the Os-

OSMUNDACEiE. 


munda regalis, which prevails chiefly in the south-west of Eng- 
land, and perhaps the south-west of the Highland tract ; being 
very frequent on the coasts of Cornwall, and occurring in plenty 
about some of the lochs of Argyleshire, and on adjacent islands. 
The range of the Osmunda extends the whole length and breadth 
of Britain ; but whether it be found on the islets north of Suther- 
land, or west of Islay, is yet unknown. Still, there are consi- 
derable tracts along the eastern side of England and Scotland, 
where it is either extremely scarce or wholly wanting. The 
Osmunda differs from most of the dorsiferous Ferns in being 
adapted to thrive in marshy places, and to flourish on the sea 
shores, sometimes only just above high water line. Notwith- 
standing that it endures the boreal climate of Sutherland, (a 
county in which the specimens are said to be small), the Os- 
munda is perhaps never seen much above the sea level in Eng- 
land, although the general vegetation of the coast in Sutherland 
approximates closely to what is observed at 1000 or 1*200 feet 
of elevation in England. In respect to frequency of occurrence, 
the Osmunda may rank nearly on the level of its allies, the Bo- 
trycliium and OpJiioglossum, though rather less frequent than 
either of these.”^ 

It is a species of common occuiTence throughout Europe ; 
and a plant very similar, and generally bearing the same name, 
is found in the United States of North America. 

There are good frgures of this fern in Bolton,f in Sowerby’s 
‘ English Botany,’! and in Hooker’s ‘ Flora Londinensis,’§ be- 
sides many of the continental works. 

All authors appear to be agreed in adopting the name of Os- 
munda regalis: the word Osmund is supposed to be derived 
from the Saxon mund, signifying strength : the rhizoma, when 
cut through, has a whitish centre or core, called by old Gerarde 
in his Herbal the heart of Osmund the Waterman : ” my lore 
is insufficient to furnish my readers with the history of the said 
Osmund. 

Its medicinal properties are not noticed in Ray’s ‘ Synopsis ; ’

indeed they are seldom alluded to by the older botanists : we 
are, however, favored by Gerarde with the following particulars. 
‘‘ The root, and especially the heart or middle part thereof, 
boyled or else stamped, and taken with some kinde of liquor, 
is thought to be good for those that are wounded, dry-beaten 
and bruised ; that have fallen from some high place : and for 
the same cause the Empericks do put it in decoctions, which the 
later Physitians doe call wound drinkes : some take it to be so 
effectuall and of so great a vertue that it can dissolue cluttered 
bloud remaining in any inward part of the body, and that it also 
can expell or drive it out by the wound.”^ 

The roots are strong and fibrous : the rhizoma is tufted, and 
very large, as might be anticipated from its capacity of annually 
producing such a weight of foliage : this rhizoma, in marshy 
situations, and when shaded by alders and other trees, rises full 
two feet above the surface of the ground, exhibiting an appear- 
ance somewhat like that of the tree ferns. The young fronds, 
varying in number from six to twelve, make their appearance in 
May, arrive at maturity in August, and are destroyed by the 
first frosts of winter ; their growth is remarkably rapid and vigo- 
rous, and, until nearly full grown, they have a reddish colour, 
like the shoots of many herbaceous plants. The fronds are 
fertile and barren. 

The fertile frond is linear and pinnate : the pinnae are four or 
five pairs in number, generally opposite, linear, and pinnate ; 
the pinnules are linear, generally alternate, stalked and rounded 
at the apex, with the exception of the apical pinnule, which is 
more acute. The apex of the frond is composed of a compact 
cluster of spikes ; these spikes correspond to pinnules, of which 
only the midvein and a slight marginal wing is present, and to 
each of the lateral veins is attached a nearly spherical cluster 
of capsules ; these clusters entirely supersede any leafy portion 
in pinnae so converted ; frequent instances, however, exhibit the 
apex of a pinnule in a leafy or barren, while the base is in a 
fertile state. In an early stage of the frond these spikes appear 
crowded and pressed together, as represented at page 333, but

they soon become more lax and diffuse, and at last entirely lose 
their rigid compressed appearance. 

The barren frond differs in having the leafy portion continued 
to the very apex, where it terminates much as in the true ferns. 
The venation in a barren pinnule is shown at page 333, where 
it will be seen that the lateral veins branch alternately from the 
midvein, soon after leaving which, each is forked, and one or both 
of the branches are usually again divided, and all the branches 
run in parallel lines to the extreme margin of the pinnules.

The Moonwort has a very extensive range in Great Britain ; 
but it may be said, both of this and the following species, that 
from their diminutive size they frequently escape that notice 
which Osmunda, from its conspicuous appearance, can by no 
possibility elude. Its chief stations may be given as in Staf- 
fordshire, Surrey and Yorkshire in England, and Antrim in 
Ireland ; but it is more or less generally distributed over the 
whole of the British Islands, including the Isles of Wight, Ork- 
ney and Shetland. It affects those dry open heaths, elevated 
pastures and waste lands, which are generally shunned by other 
ferns, with the exception of the Common Brakes. I know of 
one instance only of its occurrence in a wood : this is mentioned 
below, and from its rarity becomes exceedingly interesting. 
The list of localities I subjoin is useful in showing its extensive 
range, and may perhaps guide the botanist to some stations be- 
fore unknown to him ; but it is presented to the reader under a 
full knowledge of its imperfections, since a complete list of lo- 
calities would be far too voluminous for the present work.

Mr. Templeton’s MSS. several Antrim localities for Botrychium 
are recorded ; some of these are scarcely above the level of the 
sea, and others have an elevation of nearly 1000 feet : Mr. Tem- 
pleton observes that about the Roughfort it is as plentiful as 
grasses or other foliage.” Mr. Thompson observes that he has 
not seen it in all the localities discovered by Mr. Templeton, 
but that it is common in the mountain pastures about Belfast, 
and he has met with it at Altmore glen, near Cushendall.

The Moonwort is found throughout Europe ; and a very simi- 
lar species — some botanists consider it identical ™ throughout 
North America. 

The figure of this plant in Sowerby’s ‘ English Botany,’ * 
under the name of Osmunda lunaria^ gives a correct idea of its 
appearance, but that in Bolton’s ‘ Filices,’f under the same name, 
is decidedly bad. 

The genus Botrychium was divided by Swartz from the Lin- 
neaii genus Osmunda^ and has been adopted by nearly all sub- 
sequent botanists. The Linnean specific name of lunaria has 
remained unchanged. 

It is rather amusing than instructive to read the virtues as- 
cribed by Dioscorides, and other ancient writers, to nearly the 
whole family of ferns. Of the present species much has been 
written, and the most wonderful magical properties have been 
assigned to it. This we may trace, in a great measure, to the 
singular form of the pinnae : all those plants whose leaves bore 
even a fancied resemblance to the moon — and the name clearly 
implies that this was the case in the present instance — were 
formerly regarded with a most superstitious veneration. From 
all record we find that they were to be gathered by the light of

present day such fancies are entirely confined to works of the 
imagination.

Gerarde says it “ is singular to heale green and fresh wounds : 
* ^ * it hath been vsed among the Alchymists and witches 

to doe wonders withall, who say that it will loose lockes, and 
make them to fall from the feet of horses that grase where it 
doth grow, and hath been called of them Martagon ; whereas in 
truth they are all but drowsie dreames and illusions ; but it is 
singular for wounds as aforesaid.” * Both Gerarde and Rayf 
speak of its virtues as a remedy for dysentery. 

The roots and rhizoma of Botrychium difier essentially from 
those of true ferns ; the root is stout, succulent and brittle ; the 
rhizoma appears to be nothing more than the base of the stem, 
scarcely distinguishable by any increase of substance : a single 
main root descends perpendicularly, and other roots issue from 
this at right angles, principally at two points, but without any 
positive uniformity in this respect. 

Before the plant has felt the influence of spring, the frond ex- 
ists in a quiescent state, but perfectly formed ; it appears like a 
simple stem, scarcely an inch in length, and perfectly erect ; on 
a closer inspection the component parts of the future frond will 
be clearly perceived ; the lower portion or rachis is considerably 
stouter than the upper part, the two portions of which face each 
other, the seed or fertile portion of the frond being clasped by 
the barren or leafy part ; and, the fructification being thus en-

lirely concealed, the uppermost piiinsB are incurved, as if to give 
still further protection to the fruit. The whole is invested and 
completely enclosed in scale-like alternate sheaths, doubtless 
the decaying stalks of many previous years. As the spring ad- 
vances the frond rapidly increases in size, until, in April, it 
makes its appearance above ground, and in May or June attains 
its perfect development. Mr. Wilson observed, as long ago as 
1830, that within the stem of the growing frond, at its base, 
was enclosed the frond for the ensuing year, and again within 
this, at its base also, the frond for the next following year. Mr. 
Wilson having most kindly communicated to me this most inte- 
resting observation, I have, during the 
past spring, carefully examined an 
abundant supply of specimens, for 
which I am indebted to Mr. Hanson 
of Reigate ; and I am thus enabled 
to give a magnified figure of one of 
these future fronds. I find the frond 
of the ensuing year in every respect 
perfectly formed ; indeed exactly in 
the same state in which it is found in 
the early spring, as above described, 
but somewhat less. The frond for the next following year is 
less perfectly formed ; indeed its component parts are not to be 
made out without some difficulty ; still it is evidently bifid, the 
fruitful and leafy portions being already distinct from each other. 
These observations were made in May (1843), while the plant 
was still growing with apparent vigour, so that we have the 
fronds for three successive years before us at the same time. In 
the plants I examined the fronds were placed alternately ; i. e. 
having laid all the specimens before me, with the fruit on the 
right hand and the leafy portion on the left ; then the frond for 
1844 invariably had the fruit on the left and the leafy portion 
on the right : the frond for 1845 appeared to be again reversed, 
having the fruit on the right and the leafy part on the left. 

I must not conclude these observations without acknowledging 
the obligation I am under to Miss Beever, who, two years sub- 
sequently to my receiving Mr. Wilson’s letter on the subject. 



MOONWORT. 


347 


sent me specimens exhibiting the structure here described, and 
called my attention to many of the particulars 1 have noticed. 

The stem is very succulent, and rises in an erect position 
from the sheath-like scales already spoken of, thus totally dif- 
fering from that of the true ferns. It is divided at about half 
its length : one branch bearing the leafy portion of the frond, 
the other the fructification : the leafy portion is pinnate ; the 
pinnae vary in number from three to eight pairs ; they are some- 
what fan-shaped, with the exterior margin slightly crenate ; the 
veins in these pinnae are branched irregularly, and extend almost 
to the margin, but are never united at their extremities : the 
fruitful branch of the stem is pinnate, the pinnae generally 
somewhat corresponding in number with those of the leafy 
branch : these lateral branches, or pinnae, are frequently again 
divided, and bear a number of nearly globular capsules, which, 
having attained maturity, open transversely, and, gaping wide, 
allow the seeds to fall out. 

Very remarkable varieties of this plant are occasionally met 
with ; one of these, the Lunaria minor foliis dissectis of Kay,'^ 
has been treated by Swartzf and WilldenowJ as a distinct spe- 
cies, under the name of Botrychium rutaceum. Three varieties 
are mentioned by Smith ; of these, is the Lunaria minor ra- 
mosa of Ray,§ 7. is the Lunaria racemosa minor adianti folio 
of BreyniiiSjll and the Botrychium rutaceum already men- 
tioned. Concerning these varieties Smith remarks, iS. has a 
branched stalk, bearing several leaves and compound spikes, 
alternately disposed ; 7. is a very slight variety, with more 
jagged leaflets than ordinary ; S', has pinnatifid leaflets, and a 
more spreading habit. All these varieties, and perhaps others, 
are found occasionally intermixed here and there with the plant 
in its proper or common form ; but never, as far as I could 
learn, so numerously distinct as to have the appearance of a 
different species.”H

copied on the following page, of a very singular form of the

plant. I found it,” says Mr. Cruickshank, on the sands of 
Barry, near Dundee, in August, 1839. I observed but three 
specimens, all exactly alike, excepting a slight difference in size, 
and I could find none of the common form of the plant growing 
near them.” I have not seen either of the specimens, and am 
unable to form from the drawing any conclusion as to the pro- 
bability of their being specifically distinct.

This plant is generally distributed over England, and in many 
places is of very common occurrence, covering acres of meadow-

land, and being considered highly injurious to the crop of grass. 
In Wales, Scotland and Ireland, it is of less common occurrence, 
a circumstance perhaps attributable to the greater frequency in 
England of those low loamy pastures which it peculiarly affects. 
I have only on one occasion found it in a wood, and this was on 
the northern slope of West Hope hill, in Herefordshire ; here it 
was large and luxuriant, the apex of the frond elegantly turning 
back, and its appearance somewhat resembling that of the 
blossom of the Egyptian Arum. In Berrington park, in the 
same county, it occurs in the utmost profusion ; and from these 
stations I obtained the specimens from which I have drawn my 
figures. In reference to Ireland, Mr. Thompson says of Ophio- 
glossum, “ Templeton remarks that it is partial to moist loamy 
or clay soils, especially meadows liable to be flooded after heavy 
rains : he particularises a locality of this nature on the banks of 
the river Logan, about three miles from Belfast.” Mr. Thomp- 
son, in company with Mr. Ball, found the Adder’s-tongue in the 
South Isles of Arran, off Galway. 

The Adder’s-tongue is a common plant on the continent of 
Europe, and it is said to occur in Africa and North America ; 
but I have been unable to satisfy myself of the identity of the 
species. 

There are faithful figures of this plant in Gerarde,^ Bolton,t 
and Sowerby’s ‘ English Botany.’J 

All modern botanists appear to be agreed as to the name of 
Ophioglossmn vulgatum. 

The virtues of Adder’s-tongue are not quite so numerous as one 
might expect from its singular name and appearance. Gerarde, 
Ray,§ and Lightfoot, extol its healing powers, the two former in 
oil, the last as an ointment. “Adder’s-tongue,” says Gerarde, “ is 
dry in the third degree. The leaves of Adder’s-tongue stamped 
in a stone morter, and boyled in Oile Oliue vnto the consumption 
of the juice, and vntill the herbes be dry and parched, and then

strained, will yeeld a most excellent greene oyle or rather a bal- 
same for greene wounds, comparable to oile of St. John’s-wort, 
if it do not farre surpasse it by many degrees ; whose beauty is 
such that very many artists haue thought the same to be mixed 
wdth verdigrease.”^ Lightfoot says the common people in 
Scotland “ sometimes make an ointment of the fresh leaves, and 
use it as a vulnerary to green wounds : ” f and Mr. Luxford in- 
forms me it is still gathered for the same purpose in some parts 
of Surrey and Sussex : and used under the name of Adder’s- 
spear ointment. 

The roots and rhizoma of Adder’s-tongue much resemble 
those of Moonwort ; but the rudimentary plant for the next year 
is exterior to the stem, and not enclosed within it as in the lat- 
ter : a reference to the figure will elucidate this explanation. 
The roots are stout, succulent and brittle ; a main root descends 
a certain but not uniform distance, emitting various lateral 
branches at right angles ; the arrangement of these lateral 
branches is somewhat verticillate ; at the lower extremity of the 
perpendicular root, I have invariably found a single horizontal 
root of very considerable length, often as much as ten inches. 
I have procured large pieces of turf filled with these plants and 
their roots, and have carefully removed the earth, expecting to 
find an underground connection between the plants by means 
of these horizontal roots ; but though I constantly found them 
in contact, I never detected anything like union. The detached 
external bud at the base of the stem contains the frond for the 
ensuing year, in a perfectly erect position, and having the leafy 
part of the frond wrapped round the spike of fructification. 

The frond comes above ground in May, still retaining its erect 
position ; it is composed of a long, smooth, pale-coloured, suc- 
culent stem, an ovate, rather acute, slanting, deep green leaf, 
and a straight erect spike, issuing from the inner base of the 
leaf. The leaf is traversed in every direction by irregular anas- 
tomosing veins. The spike is distinctly stalked, the stalk being 
sometimes three or four inches, but generally scarcely more than 
one inch in length. The spike itself is rather stouter at the

base, very gradually tapering to the apex ; it is composed of two 
series of large, imbedded, crowded, circular capsules ; these 
capsules appear to be spherical cavities, filled with a pollen-like 
dust : when mature each capsule opens by a transverse fissure, 
the pollen- like dust escapes, and the lips of the capsules remain 
separate and gaping. 

Instances of monstrosities occur in which two, three, four, 
five, and even six spikes issue from a single leaf. 



COMMON CLUB-MOSS.

COMMON CLUB-MOSS {natural size). 
Lycopodium clavatum, Linneus. 


The Common Club-moss, Wolf’s-claw, or Stag’s-horn, is the 
only species of Lycopodium that can be spoken of as abundant 
in Britain. It occurs on most of our moors and heaths, espe- 
cially when rather more elevated than the surrounding country ; 
for instance, in the vicinity of London it is found on Hampstead 
Heath, High Beech, the Addington hills, &c. It is abundant 
on nearly all the mountains of the north of England, Wales and 


354 


LYCOPODIACE.E. 


Scotland, and is found occasionally, but less frequently, in simi- 
lar situations in Ireland. 

This Club-moss is a handsome and interesting plant. I have 
heard of a lady who had a ball-dress ornamented with its grace- 
ful festoons ; and Linneus relates that in Lapland he saw the 
boys with their heads decorated with chaplets or wreaths formed 
of it, the double spikes projecting on all sides, a sight which 
reminded him of the fauns and satyrs : and Tragus says that 

the girls in Germany make it into chaplets and belts.f 

Old Gerarde has some remarks on the subject, which are so 
pleasant that I think my readers will not object to my quoting 
them at length. There is another kinde of mosse which 1 
have not elsewhere found than upon Hampstead Heath, neere 
unto a little cottage, growing close upon the ground amongst 
bushes and brakes, which I have shewed unto divers surgeons 
of London that have walked thither with mee for their further 
knowledge in simples, who have gathered this kinde of mosse, 
whereof some have made them hatbands, girdles, and also bands 
to tye such things as they have before gathered, for the which 
purpose it most fitly served ; some pieces whereof are six or 
eight foot long, consisting as it were of many hairy leaves set 
upon a tough string, very close couched and compact together, 
from which is also sent forth certain other branches like the 
first : in sundry places there be sent down fine little strings, 
which serve instead of roots, wherewith it is fastened to the up- 
per part of the earth, and taketh hold likewise upon such things 
as grow next unto it. There spring also from the branches bare 
and naked stalkes, on which grow certaine eares as it were like 
the catkins or blowings of the hasell-tree, in shape like a little 
club or the reed mace, saving that it is much lesser, and of a 
yellowish white colour, very wel resembling the claw of a wolfe, 
whereof it tooke his name, which knobby catkins are altogether 
barren, and bring forth neither seed nor floure.”!

COMMON CLUB-MOSS. 355 

It seems rather unaccountable that neither Gerarde, nor his 
able editor, Johnson, to whom, by the way, the great herbalist 
is indebted for the better half of his fame, should have so en- 
tirely overlooked the minute but multitudinous seeds, which have 
attracted the attention of so many other botanists. Olearius 
appears to have been the first to mention these seeds, and a 
curious purpose to which they have been applied. This author 
devotes the 24th chapter of the 4th book of his Itinerary, to the 
fire-works of Ardebil, a town in Persia ; and he believes them 
produced by the seeds of this Lycopodium. He observes, ‘‘We 
saw at a distance some flames rise suddenly in the air, and as 
suddenly disappear, and we supposed them to be produced by 
the Russian Plaun, which is much used for this purpose. The 
plauuy to explain more fully, is nothing more than a yellow dust 
which is beaten out of the Muscus terrestris. The moss is 
called in herbals heerlap* or DeviVs-claw, and grows commonly 
in fir and birch woods, and also on waste lands : I have fre- 
quently met with it in the Russian and Livonian woods. It 
throws out twin cones, which, when ripe in August, are collected 
in large quantities and dried in furnaces ; the powder is then 
beaten out and sold by the pound. I bought several ox-blad- 
ders full, and brought them home with me. Its other uses are 
in green wounds, recent bruises, and for chafed children, inas- 
much as it is of a drying and healing nature ; and it is more- 
over used by the Russians in the Chaldaic fire above spoken of. 
The powder is placed in a tin case, of elongate conical form, 
about half an ell in length, or sometimes shorter ; this is taken 
in the hand, and a burning light or torch is placed at the aper- 
ture ; the case is then waved about in the air, so that the plaun 
flowLS through the aperture, and then ignites, producing a bright 
flame : when the motion is rapidly repeated, so that one flame 
follows another, it produces a very extraordinary effect. Fine 
fun may be made in company, if a tobacco-pipe be secretly 
filled with this plaun, and held to the light and blown into ; a 
strong flame, suddenly and unexpectedly to those sitting around, 
proceeds from it, and that it may produce a great noise they mix 

Tragus figures the plant under this name.

LYCOPODIACEiE. 


it with powdered birch-leaves. The plaun-powder has the pro- 
perty of igniting only when it is dusted through a flame in the 
air, and not otherwise, even if a torch or light be placed in it, 
or it be cast on live coals. In case the plaun is not to be ob- 
tained, finely powdered sweet-scented gum or rosin will answer 
the purpose, and this, besides the amusement, produces a plea- 
sant smell. The plaun has no particular smell and produces no 
smoke.”^ Subsequent writers appear to have curtailed and 
garbled these interesting remarks, rather than verified them by 
their own observations. 

In some of the chemists’ shops of this country the seed of 
Lycopodium is kept as an article of sale; and Mr. Luxford, who 
has tried the experiment, bears ample testimony to its inflam- 
mable property. The demand for this article, as may be sup- 
posed, is extremely limited, yet a friend has informed me that 
he is acquainted with a chemist who has received an order for 
several pounds weight of it ; the purpose for which this large 
quantity was required is unknown. Sir J. E. Smith says that 
the seeds are still sold in the shops in Germany for the purpose 
of producing artificial lightning on the stage :f this use must 
however be very limited, on account of the difliculty of procu- 
ring the seed in any quantity ; and moreover, as mentioned 
above by Olearius, pulverised rosin is found to be a cheap and 
efficient substitute. I have lately been informed that these seeds, 
spread upon a plate of metal, have been employed in Chladni’s 
lectures to illustrate the vibration produced by sound. 

Many writers have said a good deal of the power of the pow- 
der or seed to repel water : it is certain that this property is ob- 
servable after a fashion, if we scatter a quantity of the powder 
on a basin of water ; when the surface is covered the finger may 
be partially immersed without becoming wet. This property 
has induced the manufacture of what has been called “ the pa- 
tent Lycopodium waterproof cloth,” an advertisement of which 
must lately have attracted the notice of many botanists. I do 
not, however, presume to say that the fabric in question is im- 
proved by the use of Lycopodium seed, or even that Lycopodium

seed is employed in its manufacture ; my knowledge of the sub- 
ject being confined exclusively to the advertisement. 

This plant has been figured by Tragus, Lobel, Tabernse- 
montanus, Cordus, Gerarde, John Bauhin, Plukenet, Matthiolus, 
Camerarius, Dillenius, &c., but with the exception of the figure 
by Dillenius,^' none of them give a very accurate idea of the 
plant : of later representations, that in the ‘ Flora Danica ’ f is 
perhaps the best, but even this does not approach in accuracy 
or freedom of drawing the admirable figure by Dillenius. 

The older botanists have generally called this species Muscus 
terrestris^ or Muscus clavatus : Cordus terms it Chamccpeuce^ 
or dwarf fir : and all writers since the establishment of the 
Linnean binominal nomenclature have agreed in naming it Ly- 
copodium clavatum. 

The medical properties of the Common Club-moss have been 
greatly extolled by our earliest writers. Tragus gives a flaming 
account of its virtues, the chief of which seem to be the remo- 
val of calculus by comminution, and the cure of gout ;X Matthi- 
olus, § Camerarius,|| Lobel,1[ Tabernsemontanus,* * * § ^ Ray,tt and 
Dillenius, J 4 appear to have taken these virtues for granted, as 
they have copied them without hesitation. Ray indeed adds 
several others, and asserts that a decoction of its leaves was 
used in Poland as a cure for a disease called Plica, whence, he 
observes, the plant has been named Plicarius and John Bau- 
hin, in addition to many other valuable properties, states that 
loose teeth may be fixed by washing the mouth with a decoction 
of the seed in red wine.|| || I am, however, inclined to think that

its use in either of these capacities must have been much less 
extensive than its historians imagined ; indeed, from certain 
references, it seems not improbable that many of its supposed 
virtues owe their origin to a passage in Dioscorides, on a plant 
which he calls Muscus marinus, and which, beyond all doubt, 
is one of the Algae. Mr. Ward informs me that whatever may 
have been its pristine fame, it holds no place in the modern 
Pharmacopoeia. Tragus observes that the Germans call the 
plant Weingrein, from its power of restoring injured wine.^ 
The same observation is repeated by his successors. 

Lightfoot, in his ‘ Flora Scotica,’ says that the Swedes make 
mats of the Club-moss to rub their feet on ; if this be true, it is 
remarkable that the fact should have escaped the notice of such 
observant men as Linneus and Wahlenberg, neither of whom 
makes the slightest allusion to the subject. Is it possible that 
Lightfoot has mistranslated the Swedish appellation of Matte- 
gras, a most appropriate name, simply equivalent to matted 
grass, and not at all implying its employment in the manufacture 
of mats ? 

The roots of this species are very tough, wiry, and pale in 
colour ; they are generally nearly straight and simple for an inch 
or more, then suddenly divided and tortuous ; they are usually 
placed singly and at rather long distances from each other, and 
do not penetrate deeply into the earth, but yet fix the creeping 
stem most firmly, and prevent any injurious action from the 
wind. It has been supposed that on lofty mountains this plant, 
forming as it does a compact matted turf, whence the Swedish 
name, serves to bind the surface of the soil more closely to- 
gether, and thus secure it from the continued crumbling away, 
to which, in exposed situations, it is constantly liable, from the 
effects of wind and rain. 

The stem is procumbent and repeatedly branched, the branches 
being at first slightly elevated, but soon becoming completely 
prostrate. It extends to a great length ; I have frequently found

plants on Crooksbuiy hill, near Farnham, in Surrey, spreading 
to a circumference of ten or twelve yards. The whole plant has 
a rigid, harsh, and wiry feel when handled, even in a living 
state, but more especially when dried. When the plant is about 
to produce seed there are thrown out, from various parts of its 
branches, spikes of about an inch in length, of a pale sulphur 
colour, and in shape somewhat resembling catkins ; these are 
usually double, but some few are single, and a still smaller num- 
ber treble ; they are erect and straight until the seed has been 
shed, when they become curved ; they are situated on a stalk 
about twice their own length, and nearly naked, a character 
which is sufficient to distinguish this from any other of our in- 
digenous species, and which gives to the plant, when growing 
luxuriantly, as I have seen it at Cwm Idwel and other parts of 
Caernarvonshire, a most striking and beautiful appearance. 

The whole of the branches are densely covered with nar- 
row, flattish, smooth leaves, the edges of which are slightly 
toothed, and the tips terminate in a filamentous point : the leaves 
as well as the stems are persistent ; I have observed them in 
March and April perfectly uninjured by our severest winters. 
On the stalks supporting the spikes the leaves are longer, nar- 
row, and of a pale yellowish green colour ; they are closely 
pressed against the stalk, and disposed somewhat in whorls, thus 
giving to the stalk the appearance of the stem of an Equisetum ; 
they also in a great degree want the long filamentous points 
which are invariably present on the leaves of the prostrate 
branches, to the extremities of which they often give a hoary 
appearance. In the spike itself the leaves are very much broader 
at the base, being altogether of a more triangular figure, and 
assuming the appearance and office of bracts or involucres ; 
their colour is pale yellow, and their margins are membranaceous 
and serrated. After the seed has escaped, these bracts become 
reflexed, giving to the spike a very altered character and ap- 
pearance. 

The capsules are somewhat reniform, perfectly sessile, and of 
a pale yellow colour : they are situated at the base of the bracts ; 
each is two-valved, and filled with numerous minute and almost 
impalpable seeds.

Mr. Moore informs me that “ this plant makes a beautiful ob- 
ject when cultivated in a greenhouse, and suspended from the 
roof or side walls. I have ” continues Mr. Moore, seen it in 
such situations with branches from three to four feet long, flow- 
ering most abundantly, and having a peculiarly imposing appear- 
ance : in this state it is not readily recognized by persons 
familiar with it in its ordinary localities.”

British Isles. In England and Ireland it is entirely unknown : 
in Wales it appears to be confined to a single locality. 

Caernarvonshire. — It was first discovered on the side of 
Glyder mountain above Llyn-y-Cwn, by Llwyd and Ray ; the 
former of whom speaks of its occurring abundantly.* Dille- 
nius corroborates this statement, f and the habitat has been 
established by modern botanists : Messrs. Borrer, Janson, 
Woods, and W. Wilson, have seen the plant growing in the 
same spot, but all these gentlemen found it very sparingly ; 
and in 1839, when I diligently searched the mountain side, I 
could not find a single plant : therefore, although the observa- 
tion of Ray is most satisfactorily established, it is still doubtful 
whether the habitat is likely to be preserved. 

In Scotland it seems more abundant, although confined to a 
few districts : it grows at great elevations, and in wild and ex- 
posed situations. 

I am indebted to Dr. Balfour for fine specimens from Ben-na- 
Bourd, in Aberdeenshire ; to Dr. Greville and the Botanical 
Society of London for others from Lochnagar and the Clova 
mountains. Mr. Watson informs me he has seen it in the moun- 
tains of Aberdeenshire and Perthshire. Sir W. J. Hooker has 
observed it on the Cairngorum range. Mr. Stables, of Cawdor 
castle, informs me he found it in Rosshire. It has also occurred 
on Goat fell, in the Isle of Arran, Hay hill, Orkney, &c. “Pretty 
frequent between 500 and 850 yards on the mountains of Clova 
and the west of Aberdeenshire : I have never seen it above 900 
or below 400 yards : Glen Dole, Forfarshire, and mountains ad- 
jacent to Ben-na-Baird, Loch-na-gar, &c.” — Francis' Analysis,

of Europe, particularly in the pine forests, its range appears very 
limited. It occurs in the British possessions in North America,

in several localities ; and has been found, though less abun- 
dantly, in the United States. 

The Interrupted Club-Moss appears to have been well known 
to our earliest botanists, although nothing remarkable has been 
recorded of its history. The best figure is that in Dillenius ; ^ 
that in the posthumous volume of Morison edited by Bobartf is 
also good ; Plukenet’sJ figure is much too small to give a satis- 
factory idea of the plant ; and that in Sowerby’s ‘ English Bo- 
tany ’§ has the fructification too much like the cone of a cedar. 

The roots are tough, wiry and tortuous, apparently not long, 
but very firmly fixed in the ground. The stem is creeping, very 
strong and tough, and has the surface deeply and irregularly 
striated : it sends out, at intervals varying from one to four 
inches, long branches in an erect position ; these increase an- 
nually in length, the growth of each year being very decidedly 
marked by the altered length and direction of the leaves ; so 
much so indeed as to give the branches a somewhat jointed 
appearance. From the marking of each year’s growth the name 
of annotinum has probably been given to this Lycopodium ; a 
name, however, not exactly appropriate, because the word rather 
implies of one year’s age, leading us to imagine the plant was 
^ annual. These upright branches are either single or again di- 
vided ; and when fertile, which is by no means invariably the 
case, the spike is usually on the sixth or seventh joint of the 
branch. After having fruited, or arrived at equivalent age, the 
erect branches become prone, throw out roots and emit erect 
branches as before. Connected with this subject Sir J. E. 
Smith has broached an interesting hypothesis, which I will give 
in his own words. “ The flowering branches are erect, densely 
leafy, but little subdivided, each terminating in a solitary upright 
spike, whose scales, being deciduous, seem to leave the branch 
partly naked, but it afterwards bears proper leaves, except a few 
diminished ones just under where the spike had been, and pro- 
duces, in the following season, another spike : hence the jointed

or interrupted aspect of the branches.”'^' This assertion would 
surely never have been made without what the learned author 
believed sufficient ground, and it is with considerable hesita- 
tion that I venture to express an opinion at variance with that 
of so observant a botanist, but I must confess that the specimens 
I have examined by no means bear out the opinions I have 
quoted ; indeed, were the hypothesis a correct one, should we 
not find the spike occupying indifferently any joint of the 
branch, and not so generally confined to those which are nume- 
rically the same ? Moreover, in a specimen now before me 
from the herbarium of Mr. S. P. Woodward, the spike exhibits 
all the symptoms of incipient decay. 

The branches, throughout their length, are clothed with linear 
leaves, which are very acutely pointed and have minute lateral 
serratures : those on the older portions are somewhat more scat- 
tered and distant, an appearance caused by the elongation of 
the stem itself, the leaves being persistent, and enduring for 
very many years. Those on the lower portion of the erect 
branches are often somewhat reflexed, while on the more recent 
growth they are erect, more crowded, and somewhat imbricated. 
Smith says that the leaves are ranged in five rows ; and an at- 
tentive examination of the plant leads one to agree with this ‘ 
remark, still the character is not noticeable, and can only be 
traced with difficulty. 

The spike is oblong, terminal, and completely sessile ; the 
long peduncle, which in the Common Club-Moss separates the 
spike from the leafy part of the branch, is entirely wanting, a 
character amply sufficient to distinguish this species from the 
foregoing. The leaves or bracts in the spike are nearly round, 
yet have a pointed apex ; their edges are membranous and 
jagged ; they become reflexed when the seed is shed : in the 
axil of each is situated a large, conspicuous, reniform capsule, 
which, when ripe, opens transversely, allowing the escape of 
numerous minute, sulphur- coloured seeds.

SAVIN-LEAVED CLUB-MOSS, [natural size). 

LycopodiuxM alpinum, Linneus. 

The Savin-leaved Club-Moss, as its name of alpinum implies, 
is completely an alpine plant : it occurs in great abundance on 
the elevated tracts in Scotland, where I have myself seen it in 
localities too numerous to detail ; and have received a long list 
of habitats from Drs. Greville and Balfour, Mr. Graham, &c. 
In several of the adjacent islands it is also found ; and Mr. Ed- 
monston has sent a specimen from Unst, the most northerly of 
the Shetlands. 

By the subjoined list of localities it will be seen that the 
range of this species is confined to the hills of Yorkshire and 
the lake district in England, and to Snowdon, Cader Idris, Plin- 
lymmon, and the Brecon Beacon in Wales.

Lycopodium alpinum occurs in alpine districts throughout 
Europe and Northern Asia ; and a very similar species is found 
in the British possessions in North America, and in the northern 
states of the Union; but a doubt is entertained whether the 
European and American species are exactly identical. 

There is a pretty good figure of this species in the ‘ Flora 
Danica,’* and another in Sowerby’s ^English Botany.’ f 

Our early botanists have so mixed up this with another con- 
tinental species, — Lycopodium complanatum^ — that it is impos- 
sible to decide to which their observations are to be referred. 
I have little doubt that Gerarde describes alpinum^ although his 
figure evidently represents complanatum, and Tragus appears 
to be unacquainted with it altogether, his figure being likewise 
that of complanatum. Dillenius, as remarked by Sir J. E. 
Smith, was well acquainted with both species, but unaccountably 
misquotes Tragus, Gerarde, Dalechamp, and the two Bauhins, 
under his description of L. alpinum : owing to this confusion 
it is unsafe to quote any of the virtues that have been assigned 
by these patriarchs of the science to either species. 

We are informed by Sir W. J. Hooker that L. alpinum is 
used by the inhabitants of Iceland as a die for their woollen 
cloths. A vast heap of Lycopodium alpinum lying before the 
priest’s house drew my attention, and on enquiry I found that 
it was used for the purpose of giving their wadmal a yellow 
die, which is done by merely boiling the cloth in water, with a 
quantity of the Lycopodium and some leaves of Vaccinium uli-

ginosum. The colour imparted by this process, to judge from 
some cloth shown me, was a pale and pleasant, though not a 
brilliant yellow.”^ The Savin-leaved Club-Moss is a pretty 
plant, in its foliage much resembling the savin from which it 
has derived its English name : it retains throughout the winter 
a much brighter green than either of its congeners : in summer 
the young shoots have a blue tint. According to Sir W. J. 
Hooker it is the badge of the clan Macrae. 

The roots are tough, strong, wiry, and generally tortuous and 
branched ; they occur at intervals varying from two to four 
inches, and are somewhat darker in colour than those of L, cla~ 
vatum; they fix the plant firmly to the soil. 

The stem is procumbent, extending to a great length, and 
throwing up at short intervals clusters of branches, which, being 
twice or thrice dichotomously divided, give the plant a densely 
tufted appearance : the tips of the branches or divisions in each 
bunch or tuft are of nearly equal length, the extremities termi- 
nating on a level. When the plant is about to produce seed, 
spikes are thrown out from the extremities of these branches 
without any intermediate foot-stalk : the spikes are rather more 
than half an inch in length, and somewhat exceed the unfruitful 
branches in thickness, and are of a paler, yellower green colour 
than the rest of the plant : they are almost invariably in double 
pairs, plainly exhibiting the repeatedly dichotomous division of 
the branches which they terminate. 

The entire plant is covered with elongate, harsh, indistinctly 
keeled, obtusely pointed leaves ; the edges of the leaves are 
without perceptible teeth or serratures, and the points have no 
acute or filamentous termination ; the leaves or bracts in the 
spike are membranous, flat, scale-like, serrated at the sides, di- 
lated at the base, and terminating in a prolonged point at the 
apex. After the escape of the seeds the spikes bend down- 
wards, assuming a semicircular form, and the bracts become 
reflexed. The capsules are sessile, of a pale yellow colour, and 
in form much resembling a kidney bean.

MARSH CLUB-MOSS.

MARSH CLUB-MOSS, [natural size). 

Lycopodium inundatum, Linneus. 

The Marsh Club-Moss appears to occur, although not abun- 
dantly, on most of the heaths and commons in the south of 
England, particularly where turf has been pared from the sur- 
face. The localities are far too numerous to detail. In the im- 
mediate neighbourhood of London many habitats have been 
recorded. In the midland and northern counties it is less com- 
mon ; in Scotland and Wales it is of comparatively rare occur- 
rence ; and in Ireland it is altogether unknown. It is found on 
wet or turfy ground, generally preferring a sandy or gravelly 
soil : its non-appearance in Ireland seems rather extraordinary. 
It exhibits the same predilection for flat and low situations which 
most of the other species display for elevated and hilly districts, 
so that it is very rarely found in company with either. 

Our early botanists were not generally acquainted with this 

2 B 


370 


LYCOPODIACE.E. 


species. It is described and figured by Vaillant and Dillenius,^ 
but the latter author has given it a branched and luxuriant ap- 
pearance which I have never seen it assume. The figure in 
Sowerby’s ‘ English Botany ’f gives a good idea of the plant. 
Tragus and Gerarde do not mention the plant, and although 
Plukenet and Morison have been quoted as authorities, I much 
doubt the correctness of the references. Its medical virtues 
have not been recorded. 

The Marsh Club-Moss is an insignificant and by no means 
striking plant. In its foliage and solitary spike it more nearly 
resembles Z^copodmm clavatum than any other British species ; 
but the nearly circular capsule and other distinguishing charac- 
ters separate it widely from that, and indeed from all the other 
indigenous Lycopodia. 

The roots are stout ; they do not penetrate the earth so deeply 
as those of either of the species previously described : the 
prostrate stem creeps close to the soil, and is occasionally, but 
rarely, branched, the branches still remaining prostrate ; the 
stem appears to be of slow growth, and never increases in size 
in the same way as that of the species before described ; be- 
tween the points where it is attached by the roots, the stem 
sometimes assumes an arched appearance. 

The growth of each year, with the exception of its extreme 
point (which remains firmly rooted to the ground), dies during 
the succeeding winter, the dead portion for some months ad- 
hering to the soil, and even after decay leaving a conspicuous 
black line on the surface. In the autumn each plant throws out 
an erect solitary spike, situated on a foot-stalk which usually 
rather exceeds the spike itself in length. 

Every part of the plant is densely clothed with linear acute 
leaves ; those on the prostrate stem are invariably curved up- 
wards ; on the footstalk they are rather more scattered, erect 
and without curvature. The leaves or bracts on the spike differ 
from the others in being broader at the base, and are not unfre- 
quently furnished with a single tooth on each side. The cap- 
sules are situated at the base of the bracts ; they are nearly 
spherical, and of a pale yellowish green colour.

PHICKLY CLUB-MOSS, {natural size). 

Lycopodium Selaginoides, Linneus. 

This species, which, without much reason, has obtained the 
name of the Prickly Club-Moss, is distributed over the hilly 
districts of the North of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. 
It delights in the vicinity of those little rills so common in 
hilly countries, and whose course is so often marked by a 
sinuous line of vivid green, delighting the heart of the botanist, 
and leading him on from crag to crag, regardless of the crum- 
bling debris and detached masses of stone which in such spots 
too often give way beneath his tread, and leap with awful bounds 
down the hill-side, till they find a new resting-place in the abyss 
below. On such localities has this interesting little plant fixed 
for its home, and here it may ever be found, the companion of 
saxifrages and the rarer ferns.

authentic habitats for this species, are few in number.

PRICKLY CLUB-MOSS. 


373 


Its range in Europe is not extensive, being almost exclusively 
confined to northern and alpine districts : it is recorded as a 
native of North America, but not having seen specimens, and 
having often felt doubts as to the identity of the North- American 
species bearing names identical with ours, I refrain from giving 
an opinion. 

Lycopodium Selaginoides was well known to Ray, who con- 
sidered it generically distinct from all the other British l^yco- 
podia,^ in which Dillenius appears to agree with him.f The 
figure^ by Dillenius is not inaccurate, but wants that elegance 
which is so characteristic of the majority of his figures : the 
other figures of our earlier botanists convey little or no idea of 
the characters of the plant. The figure in Sowerby’s ‘ English 
Botany ’ § is tolerably accurate. 

The roots are extremely slender, thread-like and fragile ; they 
take but a slight hold on the crumbling soil in which this spe- 
cies is usually found. 

The stem is procumbent, very slender, weak, repeatedly 
branched ; the branches short and somewhat sinuous : the seed- 
bearing spikes are thrown up at intervals, generally two or three 
on each plant ; they are subclavate, and considerably thicker 
than the prostrate stem. 

The entire plant is clothed with lanceolate leaves, which are 
serrated and almost jagged at their edges; those on the pro- 
cumbent slender portions of the stem are shorter, narrower and 
somewhat scattered, while those on the spike, more properly 
termed bracts, are every way larger and much broader at the base. 

The capsules are sessile at the base of the bracts, pale yellow 
and tolerably round ; the upper ones contain the usual minute 
pollen-like particles which have already been spoken of as the 
seeds of Lycopodium clavatum^ used under the name of ^ plaun ’ 
for the production of flashes of light ; the lower ones contain 
larger grains, equal in size to the seed of many phsenogamous 
plants. This double mode of fructification has excited the 
admiration of botanists from the earliest period, and given rise 
to a variety of conjectures : some have contended that both the 
large and small grains are productive seeds ; others that the

smaller bodies are true seeds, the large ones gemmae or buds ; 
others that the smaller are abortive and the larger productive 
seeds ; and others again that the larger ones only are seed, the 
smaller ones being grains of pollen. 

Wahlenberg^ has given a very clear and accurate description 
of this twofold fructification. He observes that the capsules 
containing the graniform seeds are subquadrilocular, in reality 
bivalve, but sometimes dehiscing in four directions ; they occupy 
the lower portion of the spike, and are larger and more protube- 
rant than those above. The seeds are always four in number, 
and are so squeezed and pressed together that three triangular 
areas are produced at the base of each ; in this particular they 
so much resemble the seeds of Isoetes lacustris, that, agreeing 
as the plants do in so many other respects, it is hardly possible 
to doubt their being closely related. The seeds are nearly as 
large as those of the poppy, and invariably fall from the capsule 
entire and are scattered upon the earth, a circumstance quite 
conclusive against their being anthers, as suggested by Hedwig. 
Capsules filled with the powdery seed common to the other 
Lycopodia and the bivalved ferns, occur in the axils of the up- 
per bracts ; this powder consists of somewhat hirsute granules, 
four of which are combined in a tetrahedron, exactly like the 
seeds in the lower capsules, exhibiting a very obvious analogy 
between the two kinds of seed, and leaving no doubt of their 
having the same origin. If therefore the powder emitted from 
the capsules of Botrychium Lunaria be true seed, it follows 
that the powder produced by the capsules of Lycopodium Sela- 
ginoides is seed also. It cannot be male pollen, its appearance 
being precisely synchronous with that of the mature seeds. 
The spike itself is annual, decaying immediately after it has 
fruited in July or the beginning of August, and the next year a 
new spike springs from some other part of the prostrate stem, 
on no part of which can a trace of future capsules be found. 
From these circumstances it seems probable that the only diffe- 
rence between the granules is that of size, each being to be re- 
garded as true seed : a somewhat analogous discrepancy occurs 
in the varied form of the seeds of spinach.

This plant appears to be more generally distributed through-

It ascends the summits of our highest mountains, as Ben-na-

Brandon, &c. in Ireland : and I have noticed that it is frequently 
found at a greater elevation than L. alpinum^ an observation 
confirmed by Mr. W. Thompson, and other observant botanists. 
Still it descends very nearly to the sea level, occurring on the 
heaths of Surrey, in the forests of Sussex, and in hundreds of 
localities throughout the southern and midland counties : indeed 
so numerous are these that I should not be justified in giving 
them all, and were I to select some and omit others I should be 
guilty of injustice to many who have kindly taken great pains 
to supply me with information. 

On the Welch mountains I have observed that only a portion 
of the plants appear to be in a thriving and healthy condition, 
the larger ones almost invariably being loaded with fructifica- 
tion, and exhibiting symptoms of incipient decay. With the 
exception of Dillenius I think no author has noticed this pecu- 
liarity ; and this learned writer rationally concludes that each 
plant exists for a definite term and then dies.* Whether the 
term of its existence be biennial, triennial, or longer, I leave for 
future observers to decide ; but I have not the slightest doubt 
that its existence has a fixed term, as suggested by the great 
museologist. 

The figures of this plant can scarcely fail of being charac- 
teristic, its appearance is so different from that of our other 
species : Dillenius figures several varieties, all of them very 
expressive of its distinguishing features. These varieties appear 
to be the result of locality : when last at the Birmingham Bo- 
tanic Garden, Mr. Cameron called my attention to some living 
specimens which he had himself collected on the Titterstone 
Clee hill ; in these the lower leaves were considerably narrower 
and somewhat reflexed, and the plants (as indeed do all from the 
same locality) exhibited a uniform although scarcely describable 
difference from those of Scotland, the North of England, and 
Caernarvonshire ; and these again differ from the specimens

collected in Norfolk, Sussex and Surrey, which are also of uni- 
form appearance, of much smaller size, and have the branches 
obtusely pointed rather than flat-topped. When rooted in the 
fissure of a rock it occasionally assumes a pendulous character, 
the branches being very long and their extremities recurved ; 
in this state the whole appearance of the plant is graceful and 
elegant, and totally dissimilar to its normal form ; such speci- 
mens I have found on the rocks in the Pass of Llanberis, and 
my brother has lately procured a fine example on the ascent of 
Plinlymmon. Mr. Babington, in a note to me, observes, ‘‘I 
have a curious specimen which was growing under a rock near 
Llanberis, in which the stems are prostrate and about a foot in 
length, and the leaves less densely placed than is usual in the 
species.” 

This species has received credit for many extraordinary medi- 
cal properties ; I shall record only a few of these. In the ^ Flora 
Prussica ’ it is recommended as a specific for ruptures, bruises, 
&c. Breynius asserts that a decoction of it destroys the lice 
which infest man ; and Linneus informs us that the Swedes 
employ it to kill those of swine and cattle. Schwenckenfeldius 
says that it is used by countrymen as a cathartic and emetic ; 
and Linneus, on the authority of Rothman, adds that it is sold, 
though not commonly, in the chemists’ shops of Sweden, under 
the name of muscus catliarticm^'' and is prescribed in the 
form of a decoction as an emetic ; but remarks that the dose 
must be very weak, otherwise it is likely to produce convulsions. 
Lightfoot says that it is taken by the Highlanders both as a ca- 
thartic and emetic, but unless used in small quantities it induces 
giddiness and convulsions ; he also informs us that in the island 
of Raasay, near Skye, and in some other places, it is used in- 
stead of alum, to fix colours in dying woollen cloths. 

The roots are numerous, tough, wiry, tortuous, and often di- 
vided : they are emitted from divers parts of the stem, always 
however where it is in contact with the earth. The plant in its 
normal form appears to be perfectly erect, but its hold on the 
ground being apparently insufficient for the maintenance of this 
position, it generally becomes partially recumbent, as represented 
in the figure. This change takes place as soon as the plant has

risen above the stunted herbage with which it is commonly sur-= 
rounded, and has thus subjected itself to the action of the vio- 
lent winds that seem to be almost incessantly sweeping the 
mountain-sides. 

The stems are repeatedly dichotomous, stout, rigid, somewhat 
flat-topped, and usually erect. 

Every part of the plant is densely clothed with rigid, lanceo- 
late, acute, entire leaves, much resembling those of Lycopodium 
annotinum. At the upper extremity of each branch a portion 
of these leaves become transformed into irregular 6-cleft calyces 
or cups, very closely resembling the perichaetia 
of mosses ; the outermost lobe of the six which 
compose this cup is longer and larger than the 
rest, and of the pair on each side one is gene- 
rally incumbent on the other, so as nearly to 
conceal it ; this was overlooked by Lightfoot, 
who, in speaking of the cup, describes it as 
consisting of four stiff*, lanceolate, incurved, 
This perichaetial cup is shown in the margin, 
and also at a a, in figures 2 and 3 of the cut below. Lightfoot, 
in continuing his description, goes on to say, at the bottom of 
this calyx are five small pellucid substances resembling leaves, 
which are supposed to be analogous to pistils ; these in time 
grow up into three large broad leaves, two united together like 
the hoof of an ox, &c.” I have only examined these parts

when in the mature state. Instead of terming the interior pro- 
cesses leaves^ I should be inclined to say that within each peri- 
chsetial cup already described, is situated a kind of flattened

gemma or bud, consisting of five distinct lobes or component 
parts, combined at the base ; the three inner lobes are large, 
prominent and conspicuous, even to the naked eye, {b in figures 
1, 2 and 3) ; the two outer lobes are very small, and may easily 
be overlooked ; one of them is closely appressed to the anterior, 
the other to the posterior surface of the bud.* These buds, 
which have no representatives in either of the previously- 
described British species of Lycopodium, are truly the germs of 
future plants, as each, when mature, is detached from its peri- 
chaetial socket with the slightest touch, falls to the earth, and 
germinates with the greatest readiness : figure 4 represents a 
bud thus germinating ; it is drawn from a specimen found in a 
state of nature. From the under surface of what may be termed 
the collum or neck of the bud, is protruded a single stout root, 
at first very pilose, but soon becoming smoother ; and in the 
centre of the three large lobes appears what might readily be 
mistaken for a sixth and central lobe, but which is, in reality, 
the undeveloped stem or ascending axis of the young plant. 
This part is very observable in figures 3 and 4, in the centre of 
each figure. As germination advances this axis gradually be- 
comes elongated upwards by the successive unfolding of the 
leaves, which are spirally arranged round it. The stem in this 
advanced state is shown at c c, in figures 1 and 2. When the 
leaves first unfold at the apex of the stem they are erect, but 
soon assume a spreading direction, and finally become reflexed. 

Whether these buds remain attached to the parent plant or 
fall to the ground, their germination proceeds in the same man- 
ner ; for when grown in a closed glass case, a situation which 
precludes the action of wind and rain, and therefore lessens the 
chance of their being dislodged, the buds germinate m situ, 
giving to the extremity of each branch a bushy and very remark- 
able appearance. A single bud thus growing in its perichaetial 
socket is shown at figure 2. A plant from the Titterstone Clee 
hill, cultivated by Mr. Luxford in a closed glass, died during

the second year, leaving green and vigorous young ones grow- 
ing on the parent stem. Some of the gemmm were accidentally 
detached when the specimen w^as planted in the glass ; these 
have vegetated on the surface of the soil, and produced young 
plants, one of which is now more than an inch high. 

It appears to me that by these gemmae the plant is so abun- 
dantly propagated in a state of nature, and not by its seeds. In 
a paper by Sir J. E. Smith, printed in the ‘ Transactions of the 
Linnean Society,’ Mr. Joseph Fox, of Norwich, is said to have 
raised young plants of Lycopodium Selago from seed. The re- 
cord of these experiments appears to me very unsatisfactory, as 
no detail is given, and I am quite inclined to suppose that the 
gemmae were mistaken by that industrious individual for the 
seeds ; if so, his observations have been verified by many sub- 
sequent cultivators.^ 

I have already stated that the perichaetial leaves and their 
buds occur near the extremities of the branches ; below them, 
and in the axils of the ordinary leaves, are pro- 
duced the true capsules, each ultimate branch 
being alike fertile throughout the greater part of 
its length. The capsules are sessile, large, yellow, 
reniform and bivalve ; their dehiscence is rectili- 
near and longitudinal, but rarely takes place in a 
state of nature. In every plant that I have exa- 
mined while living, the capsules have been firmly 
closed ; by pressure however they may be com- 
pelled to open, when they are found to be filled with minute 
yellow seeds. A detached leaf, with its axillary capsule, is re- 
presented in the margin.

The Quillwort, though confined to our mountain lakes, is an 
abundant plant in such situations, clothing the bottoms of the 
deep and still waters with a perennial verdure, and supposed by 
the casual tourists to be a submerged grass. 

From the following list of English and Welch localities, it 
will be at once seen that its geographical range is very limited.

Brecknockshire. Mr. Ralfs informs me he found it in the 
lake below Brecon Beacon. 

Caernarvonshire. — I have found it in more than a dozen of 
the little lakes which abound in the Snowdon range, and this 
appears to be one of the earliest recorded habitats. It was found 
in Ogwen, Lyn-y-cwn, and the lakes of Llanberis, by Llhwyd, 
Ray, Richardson, and Dillenius, the latter of whom waded into 
the waters of Llanberis purposely to find it. The imagination 
of a botanist delights to picture the Sherardian professor in this 
interesting situation : his shoes, with their enormous silver buc- 
kles, and his grey-ribbed hose, are seen reposing on the strand ; 
his important bag wig and his formidable military hat, sharply 
looped on three several sides, adorn his learned head ; the am- 
ple skirts of his coat are gathered on one arm, whilst the other 
hand grasps a gold-headed cane, wherewith to uproot the brittle 
Calamaria. I will quote the entire passage in which this ad- 
venture is recorded ; the mention of uncomfortable lodgings will 
be amusing to those modern botanists who have feasted in the 
palace-like hotel, now standing almost on the site of the philo- 
sopher’s pathetic lamentation. “ I found the common Suhularia 
folio rigido, mentioned to grow only in Phynon Vreech, and the 
Juncifolia cochlearics capsulis^ pretty plentifully, which re- 
lieved me very much of our disappointment of not seeing more 
Glyder plants. In the lake near Llanberis, a little further on, 
where you found the Suhularia fragilis, folio longiore et tenu- 
iore, cast out of the lake, I pulled off my shoes and stockings, 
and found it growing there in great plenty. If any body had 
the means of fishing out plants from the depths of these lakes, 
I am inclined to think he might find strange things. Near this 
place, about three years ago, Mr. Evans, coming home late from 
a christening, in stormy and rainy weather, was drowned. His 
corpse could not be found by any means used for fishing. There 
being no parson living at the place at present, it is almost im- 
possible for any body to go herborizing thither. We had very 
hard and uncomfortable lodging at the alehouse, and with difii- 
culty got a young man to be our interpreter and guide. At last

young Mr. Evans, of Bangor, gave us leave to lie at his house, 
and sent us provisions from Bangor. 

If some rich botanist, that has no relations or children, would 
build a house there, and buy some land to it, which might be 
done with little money, it would be a very kind invitation for 
botanists to visit these strange places, and be an inducement for 
making a collection of Welsh plants, as you proposed. With- 
out such a fixed place of abode it seems to me impracticable.”^ 

Dillenius learned from the mountaineers of the neighbourhood, 
that fish feed on the Isoetes ; and that when detached from its 
hold in the soil and cast on shore, the cattle devour it greedily 
and grow fat on it.f The passage is rather obscurely worded, 
and its meaning seems to have been mistaken by compilers, who 
make it fatten the fish, and leave the bullocks out of the question.

The figures by Dillenius^ are striking, but in some points 
scarcely accurate. That in the ‘ Flora Danica ’ f possesses 
none of the characteristics which distinguish the root of our 
British species, and this part of the drawing is either supplied 
from imagination or drawn from a species hitherto undiscovered 
in this country. The same observation applies to the figure of 
the capsule in ‘ English Botany,’ J where that part is represented 
as bivalved. Sir W. J. Hooker’s figure in the ‘Flora Londi- 
nensis ’ § is the best that I have seen, but in this there is an in- 
distinctness in the representation of the tuber. In Loudon’s 
‘ Encyclopcedia of Plants,’ || the capsule oi Pilularia is given as 
that of Isoetes, and that of the latter is entirely omitted. 

I quite concur with Sir J. E. Smith in believing this plant to 
be the Suhularia vulgaris erecta folio rigidissimo, and also the 
Suhularia fragilis folio longiore et ienuiore of Bay’s ‘ Synop- 
sis :’ H the plant introduced between these two appears to be 
the Littorella lacustris of modern nomenclature. Our plant 
was also the Calamistrum of several of the older writers, and 
the Calamaria of Dillenius.*^ It should, however, be observed 
that the three names— Calamistrum and Calamaria 
— appear to be used indifferently in various parts of the Linnean 
Correspondence. I believe all modern botanists are agreed on 
the name of Isoetes lacustris. 

With the exception of the observation of Dillenius already 
quoted, about fishes and bullocks, and a note in Sprengel im- 
plying that fishes root it out of the mud, I can find no informa- 
tion as to the uses or virtues of the Quillwort. Gerarde appears 
not to have known the plant, or he would doubtless have given 
us some account of its properties. 

The roots are three or four inches in length, flexible, semipel- 
lucid, of uniform substance, tubular, and sometimes dichoto- 
mously divided towards the extremity. They spring from a 
tuber, which, in mature plants, is about the size of a hazel-nut.

This tuber seems analogous to what I have called a tufted rhi- 
zoma in ferns : it is of various form, commonly, however, slightly 

bilobed; its external coating is spongy, 
and of a dark brown colour approach- 
ing to black, and apparently composed 
of decaying portions of the tuber : 
the interior is very compact and of a 
pure white, with a small and nearly 
pellucid portion in the centre, whence 
the leaves appear to originate. The 
taste of this tuber is earthy, but not 
otherwise remarkable, and it seems 
perfectly innoxious, as I have eaten 
several without injury. A longitu- 
dinal section of the tuber [t t) with 
its attached roots, is shown in the 
margin. Wahlenberg says that this 
tuber vegetates in the interior while 
dying round the circumference,* a 
mode of accounting for its appearance 
which seems highly probable. 

The leaves are sessile, and rise from 
the crown of the tuber ; at the base 
they are very broad, and furnished with 
membranous margins, which clasp the 
inner leaves much in the same man- 
ner as the scales of a lily-bulb. With 
the exception of this basal portion, 
the leaves are nearly cylindrical, some- 
what however approaching to a quad- 
rate form, with obtuse angles, and 
terminating in a sharp point ; they are hollow, the interior being 
divided by longitudinal septa into four tubes, which are again

subdivided into numerous compartments by transverse septa 
placed at irregular distances : these transverse septa are very 
apparent through the semi-pellucid substance of the leaf, and

alike throughout the year. The exterior leaves decay slowly

and in order of priority, the decay commencing in each leaf 
about an inch above the crown of the rhizoma, and extending 
upwards and downwards ; the decayed portion soon loses its 
rigidity, the upper part bending over and becoming prostrate. 
The leaf retains its attachment long after its vitality has ceased; 
and numerous leaves so attached fall over the tuber when the 
plant is taken from the water, and, mingling with the roots, are 
preserved as such in most of our herbaria. Leaves in a state of 
decay are shown in the figure at page 381. 

The fructification of the Quillwort is very curious. It consists 
of capsules, about the size of swan-shot, placed singly at the 
base of each leaf, in the very substance of which they are im- 
bedded ; only a very small portion of the capsule being visible 
through a circular aperture in the anterior face of the leaf. In 
this structure it differs widely from Lycopodium^ in which 
genus the capsule is quite distinct, although perfectly sessile in 
the axil of the leaf, and removable without injury to the leaf 
itself. The substance of the capsule is hard 
though membranous ; it is attached at a 
single point (5) on its posterior surface, to 
something which appears analogous to a 
midrib of the leaf. The figure in the mar- 
gin represents a capsule removed from its 
cavity in the leaf : from its point of attachment {h) arise what 
appear to be two free placentae {a a) for the attachment of the 
seeds, yet I cannot positively assert that such is their office, for 
I have never opened a capsule without observing that the seeds 
escaped, as if entirely without attachment. Wahlenberg speaks 
of these bodies as being many, and has represented four diverging 
from one point of attachment : from this statement, and that 
author’s surpassing accuracy, I am inclined to suppose the few 
capsules which I have had the opportunity of examining in a 
recent state, and more especially the one which I have drawn, 
to be exceptions to the general rule, especially as in the generic 
character of Isoetes in ‘ English Flora,’* Sir J. E. Smith describes 
the capsule of the fertile flowers as having “ several transverse

389 


bristle-shaped bars.” Be this as it may, I have preferred in this, 
as in other instances, representing nothing more than 1 have 
seen. Wahlenberg also represents — and other writers have 
adopted his view — the seeds attached to these placentae : this 
also appears to be highly probable, but I have hitherto failed 
in my attempts to prove it correct. The seeds themselves are 
rugose and perfectly white ; they have raised ridges on the 
surface, indicating a quadruple division ; indeed, when thus di- 
vided, the inferior half of each seed is nearly hemispherical, and 
the superior half may be again divided into three sub-triangular 
portions. When crushed, even after the lapse of years, these 
seeds are found to be filled with a transparent and somewhat 
oleaginous fluid. Other capsules contain apparent seeds, which 
are extremely minute, being scarcely equal in size to the pollen- 
granules of many flowering plants : these minute bodies possess 
the form and characters of the larger seeds. The capsules con- 
taining the two kinds of seed are scarcely to be distinguished 
from each other, nor do they follow any law in their relative po- 
sition, as many of our botanists have asserted, but most fre- 
quently occur alternately. Linneus, in his ^ Iter Scanicum,’ 
has described these as male and female flowers,* but botanists 
are not agreed as to their precise nature ; the question, when 
discussed, must comprise the kindred twofold fructification of 
Lycopodium Selaginoides, and probably many other species : 
the real nature of the four portions into which each (supposed) 
seed is divisable, also requires further investigation. 

There are two forms of Isoetes, so different that Dillenius, 
and, in some of his works, even Linneus, treat them as distinct 
species ; thus in the passage quoted from Dillenius, at p. 382, 
they are designated “ Suhularia folio rigido ” and “ Suhularia 
fragilis and in his great work, the ‘ Historia Muscorum,’ the 
same author describes them as ‘‘ The short and thick-leaved

Quillwort, Calamaria folio hreviore et crassioref and ‘^The 
long and slender-leaved Quillwort, Calamaria folio longiore et

characters.* The following paragraph from a letter of Linneus 
to Haller, written in 1749, and printed in Smith’s ‘ Selection of 
the Correspondence of Linnaeus, &c.”f proves that this great 
botanist considered the two forms to be species. — “ In Scania 
I have met with the flowers, male as well as female, of both 
species of Calamistrum, figured by Dillenius, in his Historia 
Muscorum^ by the name of CalamariaH'' 

Gray, in his ^Natural Arrangement of British Plants,’^ makes 
two varieties in addition to the normal form of the plant, and 
describes them as follows. 
iS. gracilis. Leaves long, slender. 

Calamaria folio longiore et graciliore. Dill. M. 541. 
y. frayilis. Leaves very brittle, slender, pointed, transparent, pores nume- 
rous, minute. 

Subularia fragilis, folio longiore et tenuiore. Rail Syn. 307, 3. 

By a reference to Pay§ it will be seen that this Subularia fra- 
gilis is an addition by Dillenius, and is probably identical with 
the Calamaria folio longiore &c. of that author ; the forms are 
thus again reduced to two, and concerning these Mr. Wilson, 
who has paid great attention to the subject, kindly sends me his 
opinion in the following words.— The solitary plants with short 
spreading leaves, I believe to be the first full development after 
the seedling state, and before any lateral extension of the rhi- 
zoma has taken place : when the plants are crowded together, 
either by lateral increase (or offsets) or by a multitude of indi- 
viduals in close contact, the fronds can grow only in an erect 
posture. In a specimen from Llyn Ogwen, the tallest I have, 
and which I cut through the middle before drying, the section 
of the rhizoma or tuber is very large, while in another specimen,

gathered in the same place, and at the same time, the rhizoma 
is very small and inconspicuous ; in a third specimen the rhi- 
zoma is very broad and concave at the base. The size of the 
tuber may depend on the age and vigour of the plant ; its ana- 
logy with the rhizoma of ferns I think considerable : when a 
number of the outer or lower fronds have ripened and dropped 
off, then and not before it becomes exposed to view.” 

Mr. Sansom has given the two supposed species a minute and 
careful examination, and has favoured me with the following 
remarks. — “ In the diffuse variety the seeds are globular or 
nearly so, and the sutures in many cases very indistinct, while 
in the erect plant the seeds are angular, the angles appearing to 
be formed by the swelling of the edges of the sutures, and thus 
giving it an angular appearance. Again, the texture of the 
seed is different ; in the diffuse plant it has a slightly pellucid 
appearance, while, in the erect variety, they are of a firmer tex- 
ture, appearing quite white and horny.” Mr. Sansom, however, 
suggests, with great propriety, the probability of the seeds which 
he examined being in different stages of maturity ; those which 
I have examined do not exhibit the differences which he has 
pointed out. 

Professor Graham says, “ I have found the slender tufted 
form noticed by Mr. Wilson, growing among the stouter solitary 
kind, with broader, shorter, spreading leaves, which are sometimes 
even recurved. I have been in the habit of attributing the first 
appearance to depth of water, and to the plants being younger ; 
but I have not observed these appearances with sufficient atten- 
tion to be very positive about this.” 

Sir J. E. Smith attempts an explanation of the cause of these 
varieties which I cannot consider entitled to much respect : he 
says, “ The taller, more slender and brittle variety |3., observed 
by Dr. Richardson, may perhaps be caused by those sudden 
risings of the water so frequent in mountainous countries, which 
will account for all the peculiar characteristics of this variety.”* 

The solution of the problem appears to me to be this. When 
the seeds arrive at maturity, the leaf, in whose base the capsule

is situated, decays, and losing its rigidity sometimes becomes 
torn or broken off by the action of the water, thus permitting 
free egress to the seeds which in all probability rise to the sur- 
face of the water, and, being carried about by the action of 
wind, germinate after a certain number of days, and then, sink- 
ing to the bottom, take root and become isolated plants of the 
dwarf, brittle, spreading kind. It must be observed that this 
escape, floating, germinating, and sinking of the seed, have been 
fully ascertained in the species next described, and therefore is 
very probably take place in Isoetes, But although some seeds 
escape in the manner I have described, by far the greater number 
remain in the capsule, and there germinate, throwing up the 
most dense tufts of slender leaves, of a vivid and very delicate 
green colour. I am indebted to Miss Beever for specimens 
which beautifully exhibit this germination of the seeds in situ, 
the parent plant and its offspring having been dried while in the 
most favourable state for displaying this peculiarity, to which 
Miss Beever particularly called my attention. These young 
plants rapidly increase in size, send their roots downwards into 
the earth, and their leaves upwards into the water ; and from the 
crowding incident on this condition of the seedling plants the 
elongate and slender leaves would naturally result. This germi- 
nation of the seed in situ, I moreover imagine to be the true 
cause of the appearance of “ crowding by lateral increase,” spo- 
ken of by Mr. Wilson. The specimens deposited in the herba- 
rium of the Linnean Society, will, I trust, not only fully establish 
the fact that this is the usual mode of increase in this truly re- 
markable plant, but will induce many to agree with me, that it 
is also sufficient to account for the difference in habit between 
plants reared in this way and those which spring from escaped 
and dispersed seeds. 

It appears from a passage in Ray’s ‘ Synopsis ’ that the Quill- 
wort may be cultivated with success in fishponds.*

The Pill-wort or Pepper-grass is found on the extreme mar- 
gins of ponds, or on swampy ground, submerged during the 
winter and more or less exposed during the summer. It is 
sometimes so abundant as to form a dense and almost inextrica- 
bly matted covering to the ground. In no instance that has 
come to my knowledge has it been found in deep water, or in a 
state of constant submersion. 

It is widely— but not very generally or abundantly — distributed 
over England and Wales : the following localities are all of 
which I have made memoranda. 

Anglesea. — Mr. Wilson informs me he has found it at Llan-

that the Pill-wort has been found near Ballinahinch, in this

The figures of this plant are generally characteristic, but 
nearly all of them err in not representing it sufficiently slender ; 
the best I have seen are those by Bernard de Jussieu, published 
in the ^ Memoires de I’Academie Royale des Sciences,’^ and by 
Mr. Valentine, in the ^ Transactions of the Linnean Society.’f 
The Linnean name of Pilularia glohulifera appears to have been 
adopted by all subsequent writers. 

The roots are generally two or three inches in length, very 
flexible, slender, and but slightly branched ; they are hollow, 
and divided by several longitudinal septa ; they appear to 
descend perpendicularly into the mud or moistened earth in 
which the plant is found : they spring from a creeping rhizoma, 
which is also hollow and longitudinally divided ; it is very slen- 
der and cylindrical, and the terminal or growing portion is in- 
variably covered with a close investment of scales or scale-like 
hairs ; these, like a similar investment common to the creeping 
rhizomas of Polypodium vulgare^ Davallia canariensisy Tricho- 
manes speciosumy and several other ferns, fall off with age, leav- 
ing the rhizoma perfectly naked and smooth. The roots spring 
from the rhizoma at intervals of considerable regularity, usually 
measuring about the third of an inch : they are generally three

or four in a cluster, and immediately above them rise an equal 
number of erect, slender, smooth, setiform, pointed leaves : 
these are hollow like the roots and rhizoma ; they are rather 
longer than the roots, and when they first make their appear- 
ance are rolled up in a manner precisely analogous to that ex- 
hibited in the circinate vernation of ferns. At many of the 
points of the rhizoma whence spring the leaves and roots, it 
also emits a small lateral branch, which bears leaves and roots 
at intervals like the parent rhizoma; and when this, in the 
course of nature, decays, these lateral branches continue vigo- 
rous, and become the nuclei whence future plants originate. 
The lateral branches occur with great regularity alternately on 
the right and left of the parent rhizoma ; in 
proportion to their distance from the terminal 
point of the rhizoma these lateral branches in- 
crease in length, and the angles at which they 
join it become more and more obtuse. 

The capsule is placed on a short stalk in the 
axil of the leaves : when full grown it occa- 
sionally attains the size of an ordinary pepper- 
corn, and is nearly spherical, but slightly elongated at its apex ; 
it is closely covered with a dense investment of hair. When 
mature it opens at the apex, dividing longitudinally into four 
parts, each of which continues attached by its inferior extremity 
to the common footstalk. Each of these four parts is hollow, 
and its cavity, which retains the figure of a quarter sphere, is, 
according to Jussieu, filled with an 
hermaphrodite flower composed of 
stamens and pistils arranged on a 
common placenta. This placenta 
is a membranous band attached to 
the interior spherical portion of the 
membrane which invests the cap- 
sule. The pistils are ranged on the 
inferior part of the placenta, and 
consequently occupy the lower por- 
tion of the common receptacle, as exhibited in the annexed 
cut, which is copied, with some slight alterations, from Mr.

MARSILIACE^. 


Valentine’s figure.^ The shaded bodies represent the so-called 
pistils of Jussieu, and one of these detached is represented be- 
low, with its gelatinous covering, the result of immersion in 
water. The upper part of each cell is occupied 
by smaller granules, which are described as 
stamens, but this appears a somewhat vague 
conjecture, their office as such never having 
been clearly proved. Whatever may be the 
correct designation of the larger granules in 
their earlier state, it is quite certain that they 
ultimately become true seeds ; for both the 
authors quoted have succeeded in tracing their germination, 
and have recorded their observations on the subject with a close 
correspondence which mutually proves their accuracy and pre- 
cision ; the improvement in the structure of microscopes, and 
the more artistical drawing of Mr. Valentine, giving however a 
decided superiority to his illustrations. These observations are 
made on the assumption that Mr. Valentine was entirely unac- 
quainted with the contents of M. Jussieu’s admirable essay, 
which, from an observation in his introductory remarks, I most 
readily believe. 

According to Jussieu the seeds of Pilularia are to be found 
in the months of September and October, floating on the sur- 
face of the water, and germinating in that situation. 

This germination of the sporules is minutely described by 
Mr. Valentine. — “ The first external sign of germination is either 
the appearance of four cells projecting through the apex of the 
conical projection, or a gradual sw^elling of that part. * 

The enlarging cellular mass then distends the conical projection, 
unfolding the plicae of that body, and at length appears exter- 
nally with four of its cells projecting beyond the general mass, 
and compressed into a quadrangular form. ^ ^ Soon after 

the exposure of the entire germ, which is effected by the reflec- 
tion of the valves [of the internal membrane] and conical mem- 
brane over the side of the spomle, where they lie quite concealed 
by the germ, little fibrillae or rootlets begin to shoot from one

side. They are simply articulated tubes, or elongated cells 
applied end to end, with frequently a bulbous extremity ; and 
each is produced from one of the cells of the germ.”^ Shortly 
after the appearance of these rootlets the cells of the germ be- 
come flatter and more intimately connected with each other ; 
and at the same time that part of the germ which closes the cavity 
of the sporule becomes hollow, and afterwards points in two 
places. These points gradually lengthen, and on dissection 
each will be found to consist of a closed sheath, one containing 
the first leaf and the other a root : these two apparently distinct 
sheaths communicate with each other, and envelope nearly 
the whole of the germ. The young leaf, when rather longer 
than the sporule, bursts through its sheath, and the root pro^ 
trudes before it is as long as the sporule. ‘‘ After the leaf has 
grown to be many times the length of the sporule, or about two 
lines long, another leaf grows from the germ close to the first, 
to which it is in all respects similar ; and then a bud begins to 
be developed from some indefinite part of the germ, but like the 
leaves and root, from within the sheath, which is now frequently 
much lacerated. This bud is covered by a peculiar kind of 
jointed hairs, whose attachments are lateral, at a short distance 
from their bases, and which contain a few colourless granules. 
This bud sometimes appears after the first leaf, in which case 
there is no second primordial leaf formed ; and is the rudimen- 
tary stem, the first growth from it being a leaf, which exhibits, 
although in a small degree, the first evidence of gyration, and 
shortly after a root, which is furnished with its own sheath. 
^ * The roots are all formed in sheaths, through the apices 

of which they ultimately burst, the sheath continuing to embrace 
the base of the root, whilst a distinct and far more delicate 
sheath closely embraces its point.”f 

The following observations from the same source are well 
worthy the attention of botanists.- — This account of Pilularia 
shows that it is incorrect to say of Acrogens that ‘ germination 
takes place at no fixed point, but on any part of the surface of 
the spores;’ for it is quite certain in this instance that germination

MARSILIACE^. 


invariably takes place at a fixed spot, which may be pointed out 
before germination has commenced. It is at that part of the 
sporule indicated by the three radiating lines which appear to 
have been produced by the pressure of the three other sporules 
that originally helped to constitute the quaternary union ; and 
as the spores of all the other tribes appear, according to Mohl, 
to be developed in similar unions, it is most probable that simi- 
lar lines indicating a valvular dehiscence also exist on them. 
This is certainly the case in some mosses, for instance, in CEdi- 
podium, and in Isoetes, Lycopodimn^ and Osmunda regalis ; 
and in those instances where such a structure is not visible, it is 
probably owing to a thickening of the membrane, or a deposi- 
tion of opaque matter on its surface, as in Pilularia. In the 
mature sporules of Pilularia they can only be discovered by 
dissection, and in the abortive ones they cannot be discovered 
at all after the first stages of their growth ; whilst, again, the 
sporules of Jungermannia complanata exhibit similar lines after 
they have been submitted to the action of sulphuric acid. After 
the protrusion of the germ, however, it does appear to be quite 
immaterial from what part of the germ the first leaves, root or 
stem shall arise.” 


The ^History of British Ferns’ ends here : the subsequent pa- 
ges are almost entirely confined to extracts, which the author 
either considered too voluminous for foot-notes or accidentally 
overlooked : he trusts they will not be found wholly devoid of 
interest and utility. And now, gentle reader, the author takes 
his leave, hoping that when perusing his performance, when de- 
tecting occasional errors — and doubtless such there are — thou 
wilt make that kind and generou^ allowance which we should all 
accord to the endeavour to do well.

ing, however, surrounded by numerous manufactories and enveloped in their 
smoke, my plants soon began to decline, and ultimately perished, all my en- 
deavours to keep them alive proving fruitless. When the attempt had been 
given up in despair, I was led to reflect a little more deeply upon the subject, 
in consequence of a simple incident which occurred in the summer of 1829. 
I had buried the chrysalis of a Sphinx in some moist mould contained in a 
wide-mouthed glass bottle, covered with a lid. In watching the bottle from 
day to day, I observed that the moisture which during the heat of the day 
arose from the mould, became condensed on the internal surface of the glass, 
and returned whence it came ; thus keeping the mould always in the same de- 
gree of humidity. About a week prior to the final change of the insect, a 
seedling fern and a grass made their appearance on the surface of the mould. 

I could not hut he struck with the circumstance of one of that very tribe of 
plants, which I had for years fruitlessly attempted to cultivate, coming up 
sponte suci in such a situation ; and asked myself seriously what were the con- 
ditions necessary for its growth ? To this the answer was, — Istly, an atmo- 
sphere free from soot ; (this I well knew from previous experience) : 2ndly, 
light : Srdly, heat : 4thly, moisture : and lastly, change of air. It was quite 
evident that the plants could obtain light and heat as well in the bottle as out 
of it ; and that the lid which retained the moisture likewise excluded the soot. 
The only remaining condition to he fulfilled was change of air ; and how was 
this to he effected ? When I published my account in the ‘ Companion to the 
Botanical Magazine,’ I overlooked the law respecting the diffusion of gaseous 
bodies, described in the preceding chapter, and stated that this change was 
produced by the variations of temperature causing alternate expansions and 
contractions in the air surrounding the plants, and which of course produced 
a certain but very limited effect. 

Thus, then, all the conditions necessary for the growth of my little plant 
were apparently fulfilled, and it remained only to put it to the test of experi- 
ment. I placed the bottle outside the window of my study, — a room facing 
the north, — and to my great delight the plants continued to grow well. They 
turned out to be Lastrcea Filix-mas and Poa annua. They required no atten- 
tion, the same circulation of the water continuing ; and here they remained for 
nearly four years, the Poa once flowering, and the fern producing three or four 
fronds annually. At the end of this time they accidentally perished, during 
my absence from home, in consequence of the rusting of the lid, and the ad- 
mission of rain water. Long before this occurred, however, I procured for the 
purposes of experiment some plants of Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes ; and 
perhaps the most instructive way in which I can communicate the results of my 
enquiries will be to select a few out of numberless experiments, in the order in 
which they occurred. To commence with — 


APPENDIX A.

1. Trichomanes speciosum ; (the T. hrevisetum of most English botanical 
works). This, the most lovely of our cellular plants, is the most intractable 
under ordinary methods of treatment. Loddiges, who have had it repeatedly, 
never could keep it alive and Baron Fischer, the superintendant of the bo- 
tanical establishments of the Emperor of Russia, when he saw the plant grow- 
ing in one of my cases, took off his hat, made a low bow to it, and said — “You 
have been my master all the days of my life.” Whence then arises the great 
difficulty of cultivating this plant ? It is simply owing to the occasional dry- 
ness of the atmosphere. Place the plant in one of my cases, and thus secure 
a constantly humid atmosphere around it, and it will grow as well in the most 
smoky parts of London as on the rocks at Killarney, or in the laurel forests of 
Teneriffe ^ 


Miraturque novas frondes." 


This plant lived for about four years in a wide-mouthed bottle, covered with 
oiled silk, during which time it required no water ; but having outgrown its 
narrow limits it was removed to some rock-work in my largest fern-house, where 
it now remains, covered with a bell-glass, and occasionally watered. 

2. Hymenophyllum, with one or two species of Junyermannia and Mosses, 
These were planted nine years since, in the bottle in which my first experimental 
plants sprang up and perished. The soil is a mixture of peat mould, loam 
and sand, with as much moisture as it would retain when water was poured 
through it. This same water has served for the nourishment of the plants up 
to the present time, nor am I at present able to assign any limit to their exist- 
ence in this state. The mould appears to be as moist and the plants as fresh, 
as on the day they were enclosed ; and when we reflect upon their independent 
state, we may, without any great stretch of imagination, carry our minds back 
to the primaeval condition of vegetation, when “ the Lord God had not caused 
it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But 
there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.” 

This will be a fitting place to make mention of a small but most interesting 
bottle which I received in October, 1837, from Mr. Newman, superintendant 
of the Botanic Garden at the Mauritius. The bottle was filled with two or 
three specimens of a little species of Gratiola and of Cotula, and tightly co- 
vered with painted canvas. The plants were in full flower. I placed them in 
a window with a southern aspect : they remained in vigour for six or seven 
weeks, when one after the other declined, and eventually all perished without 
ripening any seed, in eonsequence of the too great humidity of the atmosphere. 
Before this took place I observed, as in my first experiment, several seedling 
ferns making their appearance between the internal surface of the glass and 

* Mr. Mackay, of Dublin, I believe is almost the only person who has succeeded in growing this 
plant well ; and to him I am indebted for my present specimens, and for numerous other kind con- 
tributions.

the mould, and therefore allowed the bottle to remain in the same situation, 
which it has occupied to the present time, the cover never having been removed; 
and it is now a truly beautiful object. The upper part of the bottle is com- 
pletely filled with the fronds of two species of Adiantum and one or two other 
species of ferns, and the lateral surface of the mould is densely coated with 
seedling ferns in all stages. 

We may learn a few useful lessons from this little bottle. We see how 
abundant the seeds of ferns are, and how easy it would be to procure many 
species of these plants from distant countries, by collecting here and there a 
handful of the surface-mould, and, at any convenient season, placing this in a 
condition favourable for their development. To those cavillers who are conti- 
nually questioning me as to the utility of ferns in creation, I answer, that one 
of the useful purposes which they serve, in common with numerous other cel- 
lular plants, is that of furnishing mould in situations where other plants of a 
higher order could not at first grow ; and this is effected in a two-fold way — 
by the decay of their fronds and the action of their roots. Mr. Webster, in 
his account of the voyage of the Chanticleer, states that in the course of his 
ramble in the Island of St. Catherine’s, when gathering ferns, he was particu- 
larly struck by observing that each plant had formed for itself a bed of fine 
mould, several inches in depth and extent, whilst beyond the circle of its own 
immediate growth was naked rock ; and this appeared so general that he could 
not help attributing the extraordinary circuinstance to the disintegrating power 
of their fibrous roots,^ which penetrated every crevice of the rock, and, by ex- 
panding in growth, appeared to split it into the smallest fragments. 

Having determined the complete success of this mode upon more than a 
hundred species of ferns, and my ideas having a little expanded, I built a small 
house about eight feet square, outside one of my stair-case windows, facing the 
north ; and, proceeding from ferns to those plants which live in their company, 
filled it with a mixed vegetation. This is called — 

3. The Tintern-Ahhey House ; from its containing in the centre a small 
model, built in pumice and Bath stone, of the west window of Tintern Abbey. 
The sides are built up with rock-work to the height of about five feet, and a 
perforated pipe runs round the top of the house, by means of which I can rain 
upon the plants at pleasure. In the middle of summer the sun shines into this 
house for about one hour only in the morning, and about the same time in the 
evening, but not at all during the winter. There is no artificial heat. It con- 
tains at present about fifty species of British, North American, and other hardy 
ferns. Lycopodium denticulatum, lucidulum and clavatum, and the following 
flowering plants — Linncca borealis, Oxalis Acetosella, Primula vulgaris. Digitalis 


* The Opuntia, or Prickly Pear, when placed in fresh fields of lava, which, in the ordinary course 
of nature, — i. e. by the successive growth and decay of lichens, mosses, and other cellular plants, 

would require a thousand years to become fertile, renders them capable of being converted into 

vineyards in the course of thirty or forty ; and this by the comminuting action of its roots. Indeed, 
in all cases, the formation of mould may be traced to the double cause of the decay of dead vegetable 
matter and the splitting power of living roots.

purpurea, Cardamine Jlexuosa, Lonicera Peridymenum, Meconopsis cambrica, 
Geranium rohertianum var. jiore alho, Dentaria hulhifera, Paris quadrifolia, 
Mimulus moschatus, Linaria Cymhalaria, Lamium maculatum, and several others. 
All these flower well, but the atmosphere is too moist, and there is too little sun 
for them to ripen seed ; with the exception of the Mimulus, the Oxalis, and 
the Cardamine, which latter grows with great luxuriance, and furnishes through- 
out the year a most grateful addition to the food of a tame Canary bird. The 
Rhapis Jiahelliformis and Phoenix dactylifera bore the cold during three winters 
in this house, when I was obliged to remove them in consequence of their size. 
A double white Camellia was also planted, about four years back, and blos- 
somed tolerably well for three successive springs, but was killed by the last 
severe winter. In a cold house like this, but with an eastern or western aspect, 
so as to admit more solar light, I believe that Camellias would flower beauti- 
fully, and be far less likely to suffer from the winters cold. The influence of 
light in enabling plants to withstand cold is far too little attended to, and in all 
cases where it is necessary to protect delicate plants in winter, light should be 
admitted, if possible. I shall next mention — 

4. The Alpine Case. Azalea procumhens, Andromeda tetrayona, A. hypnoides, 
Primula minima, P. helvetica, Soldanella montana, S. alpina, Eriophorum alpi- 
num, and a few others, were the contents of my first alpine case. As I thought 
there would not be sufficient light at any of my windows, I placed the case on 
the roof of the house, and in the following spring all the plants flowered well 
except the Andromedas. Forgetting that an alpine summer is not so long as 
ours, I allowed the plants to remain fully exposed to the sun for the whole 
year, owing to which they became so exhausted that some died, and but few 
flowered in the ensuing spring. Warned by this, in my succeeding experiments 
on this interesting tribe of plants, I remove the case after their flowering into 
the coldest and most shady place I can find, until the following winter, when 
they resume their old position. In this way they flourish much better, but it is 
impossible to do them full justice, as we cannot give them the perfect rest 
which they require. 

5. Draiving-Room Case. This case is at present filled in the bottom with 
two or three small Palms, some ferns, two or three species of Lycopodium, and 
several bulbous roots. Within, and along the roof of this case, runs a perfo- 
rated bronze bar, from which are suspended small pots, containing Mamillaria 
tenuis, two or three species of Cactus, and one or two Aloes. In such a case as 
this it is easy to grow bog plants in the bottom and succulents at the top, these 
last never receiving any moisture but in the state of vapour, and that more 
abundantly when they most want it, viz. in the heat of summer. The distance 
between the surface of the mould at the bottom and the suspended plants does 
not exceed eighteen inches. The case stands in the window of a room with a 
southern aspect, and the thermometer in summer frequently rises to 110°, and 
even higher. This case requires occasional watering. 

6. Small Bottle ivith Mamillaria tenuis, a species of Cactus, and two or three 
fleshy species of Euphorbia, This stands under the drawing-room case. The

plants have been enclosed four years ; the mould consisting of very sandy loam. 
No water has been given since they were planted, and all are in a state of per- 
fect health, although now outgrowing their narrow bounds. 

7. Crocuses and Winter Aconites. Two cases were filled with roots of these 
plants ; the one placed outside a window with a southern aspect, where there 
was plenty of light, but no artificial heat ; the other in a warm room, where 
the light was very deficient. The plants in the former case exhibited a perfectly 
natural appearance, — their flowers were abundant and well coloured ; while in 
the latter the leaves grew very long and pale, and not a single flower was 
produced. 

8. Crocuses with Artificial Light. A case fitted up precisely as the two pre- 
ceding was placed on my staircase, close to a gas lamp. The plants were co- 
vered during the day with a thick dark cloth, so as effectually to exclude 
day-light, and as soon as the gas was lighted the cloth was removed. The 
plants were thus exposed from five to eight hours daily to the influence of arti- 
ficial light, accompanied with some degree of heat, while the remainder of the 
twenty-four hours was spent in a state of rest. The plants grew very well, the 
leaves not so much drawn up as those in the warm room, and the color more 
intense. One root flowered, the color of the flower being blue. 

9. Case with Spring Flowers. In order to have a gay assemblage of flowers, 
I filled a case about three feet by one with the following plants, viz.. Primula 
sinensis^ P. nivalis, Scilla sibirica, Cyclamen Coum, Ornithogalum Sternbergii, 
Gagea lutea, Ganymedes pulchellus, and three or four varieties of Crocus, inter- 
spersed with little patches of Lycopodium denticulatum. This case was placed, 
about the end of February, outside a window with a southern aspect. It is not, 
I believe, possible to see these plants to such advantage in an ordinary garden. 
Here, undisturbed either by wind or rain, their flowers are developed in the 
greatest luxuriance ; and most of them continue for two or three months,^ 
realising the beautiful description of Catullus : — 

“ Ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis 
Ignotus pecori, nullo contusus aratro 
Quern mulcent aurse, firmat sol, educat imber, 

Multi ilium pueri, multse optavere puellse.” 

10. Fairy Roses. I procured two of the smallest varieties of Fairy Rose, 
planted them in two tubs, in some good loam, with broken pots at the bottom, 
and then covered them with bell-glasses, the diameter of which was rather 
smaller than that of the tubs, and placed them outside a window facing the 
south, where they have now' remained three years. These plants are as nearly 
as possible in their natural condition, very seldom requiring water, as the rain 
which falls runs over the glass through the mould. They begin to flower early 

* The Chorizema ilicifolium, if placed in such a situation in the beginning of May, will continue 
to flower for four or five months ; and cut flowers will last twice or thrice as long as in ordinary 
rooms.

in the spring, and continue for four or five months in great beauty, nothing 
more being required than to give them an occasional pruning. 

It would be waste of time to detail any more of these minor experiments, 
and I shall therefore conclude by giving a short description of my largest ex- 
perimental house. My object in this building was to obtain as many varied 
modifications of the natural conditions of plants as it was possible to procure 
in the small space to which I was confined. 

The greatest length is twenty-four feet, width twelve feet, and extreme height 
eleven feet : — 

“ Exiguus spatio, variis sed fertilis herbis.” 

By building up rock-work to within a foot of the glass, and by varying the 
surface in every possible way, very different degrees of heat, light and moisture, 
are apportioned to the various plants. The house is heated in the winter by 
means of hot-water pipes, which preserve the lower portion during that season 
at a much higher temperature than the upper ; the latter however has the ad- 
vantage in the height of summer. The range of the thermometer throughout 
the year in the lowest part is between 45" and 90", whilst at the top it is between 
30" and 130". Thus we procure, in a space not exceeding ten feet, an insular, 
and what may be called an excessive climate. There is no sunshine from the 
end of October to the end of March. In the lower portion are planted the 
following Palms : — Phcenix dactylifera, P. leonensis^ Rhapis Jlahelliformis, R. 
Sicrotsik, a small but beautiful species from Japan, Chamcerops humilis, Sea- 
forthia nobilis, Cocos hotryophora, Sahal palmatus, Latania horbonica, and one 
or two others. Among the ferns we have Asplenium prcemorsum^'^ remarkably 
fine, Diplazium seramporensef (the Asplenium pubescens of Link), Didymo- 
chlcena sinuosa, and more than a hundred other species. Of Scitamineous plants, 
of which there are ten or a dozen species, the Calathea zebrina is the most con- 
spicuous. The Caladium esculentum^ and numerous other plants which do not 
require much sun, likewise grow in this part of the house. In the upper region 
are numerous species of Aloe^ Cactus, Bilbergia, Begonia, &c. &c. Two or 
three varieties of rose likewise flower here, but neither so well nor so freely as 
in the cases already described. In hot summers the Mimosa pudica flowers 
freely, as do one or two species of Passijiora. In the intermediate spaces are 
Disandra prosirata. Fuchsias, and various other plants. From the roof are sus- 
pended numerous succulents and Orchideous epiphytes, but the temperature 
falls too low in the winter, and rarely rises sufficiently high in the summer, for 
these splendid things without a foundation, % so that they rarely flower. In a 
large vessel containing about twenty gallons of water, Papyrus elegans grows 
very well, as does Vallisneria spiralis, and some other aquatics. In addition to

this great variety of living forms, this house contains a large and fine collection 
of Lepidodendra, Calamites, See. &c., which, when compared with their recent 
types, the Lycopodia and Equiseta, are truly — 

“ of aspect that appears 

Beyond the range of vegetative power.” 

Such are some of the results obtained in a temperate climate, and there can- 
not, I think, he a doubt that in tropical countries the application of this same 
plan might be equally striking and beneficial. 

In ordinary horticulture a great deal is effected by closely imitating the na- 
tural conditions of plants. Thus my friend Dr. Royle, who has paid especial 
attention to this subject, informed me that there were certain plants in his gar- 
den at Saharunpore, which he could only keep alive by surrounding them with 
small trees and shrubs, so as to give them a moister atmosphere than they could 
otherwise have obtained ; and he mentions in his beautiful work, the ‘ Illustra- 
tions of the Flora and Fauna of the Himalayas,’ a striking example of this 
kind. — “ To show the effects of protection and culture, Xanthochymus dulcis 
may be adduced as a remarkable instance. This tree, which is found only in 
the southern parts of India, and which would not live in the more exposed cli- 
mate of Saharunpore, exists as a large tree in the garden of the King of 
Delhi ; but here, surrounded by the numerous buildings within the lofty palace 
wall, in the midst of almost a forest of trees, with perpetual irrigation from a 
branch of the canal which flows through the garden, an artificial climate is 
produced, which enables a plant even so sensitive of cold as one of the Gutii- 
ferce to flourish in the open air of Delhi, where it is highly prized, and reported 
to have milk thrown over its roots, as well as its fruit protected from plunder 
by a guard of soldiers.” 

Supposing ourselves in a hot and dry country, let us see what may be done 
by surrounding our plants with glass, and lowering the temperature, if re- 
quired, by means of the evaporation of water from the external surface. We 
shall be enabled in this manner, as with the wand of a magician, to turn a 
desert into a paradise. The probable results cannot be better described than 
by copying the beautiful description of the palm-groves given us by Desfon- 
taines, in his ‘ Flora Atlantica,’ 

“ Palmeta radiis solis impervia, umbram in regione calidissima hospitalem 
incolis, viatoribus, aeque ac animantibus ministrant. Eorum denso sub tegmine 
absque ordine crescunt aurantia, limones, punicse, oleae, amygdali, vites, quae 
cursu geniculato saepe truncos palmarum scandunt. Has omnes fructus suavis- 
simos, licet obumbratae ferunt ; ibique mira florum et fructuum varietate, pas- 
cuntur oculi ; simulque festivis avium cantilenis, quas umbra, aquae, victus 
illiciunt, recreantur aures.”^ 

* These palm groves, being impervious to the sun’s rays, afford a hospitable shade both to man 
and other animals in a region which would otherwise be intolerable from the intense heat. And 
under this shelter the orange, the lemon, the pomegranate, the olive, the almond, and the vine, grow

There are many other situations where these cases would he useful, as. on 
ship-board or in other places where there exists a necessity for economizing 
water, or in very cold countries, where it is equally necessary to make the best 
use of the little sun they possess and to protect the plants from cold winds. 
The cabbages of Iceland and Labrador would surely exceed their present size 
of about one or two inches in diameter if thus protected. 

To conclude with a few general observations. 

The advantages of this method of growing plants consist, first, in the power 
we possess of freeing or sifting the air from all extraneous matters ; — then of 
imitating the natural condition of all plants, as far as the climate we are living 
in will enable us so to do ; and of maintaining this condition free from those 
disturbing causes to which plants are oftentimes subjected from sudden varia- 
tions of weather. They are preserved of course from the excess or deficiency 
of moisture, and, owing to the perfectly quiet atmosphere with which they are 
surrounded, they are able, like man, to bear extremes of heat and cold with 
impunity, which in ordinary circumstances would destroy them. The experi- 
ments of Sir Charles Blagden and others, in heated ovens, are well known, and 
the performances of Chaubert are familiar to most of my readers. In these 
instances the immunity is owing to the aqueous exhalations from the surface of 
the body remaining undisturbed, and acting as a protecting shield. In like 
manner the Trichomanes lived for three years, in a window with a southern as- 
pect, exposed continually to a heat which, without the glass, would have 
destroyed it in a single day. With respect to cold, the concurrent testimony 
of all arctic voyagers proves that no inconvenience is felt, even at 70“ below 
zero, provided the air be perfectly still ; but, that if wind arose, although the 
thermometer generally rose rapidly with the wind, the cold then became insup- 
portable. We need not go to the Pole for illustrations of this fact. Every 
one has felt the difference between walking with his face or his back to one of 
our east winds in March, those winds which are often so destructive to vegeta- 
tion in the open air, but have not the slightest effect on enclosed plants. I 
need not say anything respecting the change of air, as, from the contents of the 
preceding chapter, it must be obvious that as soon as any gas is generated 
within the case different to the atmosphere without, diffusion immediately com- 
mences, and no mode of closing the cases which I have adopted can prevent 
this from taking place. 

As regards the cases in which these plants are grown, their shape or size may 
be adapted to the situations in which they are to be placed. The best cover for 
the smaller ones is, 1 think, the oiled silk of which bathing-caps are made, or 


in wild luxuriance, producing, notwithstanding they are so shaded, the most delicious fruit. And 
here, while the eyes are fed with the endless variety of flowers which deck these sylvan scenes, the 
ears are at the same time ravished with the melodious notes of numerous birds, which are attracted 
to these groves by the cool springs and the food which they there find.” — A'idd’s Bridgewater

thin sheet India-mhher. The frames of the larger cases should he well 
painted, and the laps so filled with putty as completely to exclude soot. 

Do plants require water in these cases? — is a question frequently ashed. 
This depends not only upon the nature of the plants, but upon the season of 
their growth. Almost all ferns, if enclosed in small cases where the water can- 
not escape, will continue to flourish for years, and I believe that a century 
might elapse without any fresh water being required. Cactuses, and most suc- 
culent plants, would he equally independent. In larger houses, where the 
surfaces are very varied, the water will drain from the upper parts, and fresh 
supplies will occasionally he wanted. If we wish our plants to grow with 
greater or less luxuriance, we have of course, at all times, the power to give or 
withhold water. Numerous plants require to he well supplied with water up 
to and during the period of inflorescence, and when the flowering is over to he 
kept nearly dry. This is easily effected by removing the cover, and allowing 
the moisture to evaporate by exposure of the case for a short time to the sun. 
It is desirable that there should he an opening in the bottom of the cases for 
the purpose of draining off the superfluous moisture, and likewise of giving us the 
opportunity of washing the mould with lime water should slugs make their 
appearance, which sometimes occurs. With respect to the mould, it is perhaps 
best to select that in which the plants which are to he the subject of experiment 
ordinarily grow ; but this is not a matter of so much moment as is generally 
imagined. It is a very common impression that great knowledge of Botany is 
required before any successful attempts at the cultivation of plants in closed 
cases can be made ; now, it must be obvious, from all that has been said, that 
whether the plant be grown in a closed case or in the open air, the natural 
conditions must be fulfilled to ensure success Again, many complain that 
the enclosed plants frequently become mouldy ; this arises either from excess 
of moisture or deficiency of light, or a combination of both causes producing 
diminished vital action, or else from the natural decay of plants. It is 
very interesting to watch the progress of this. The moment a plant begins 
to decay it is no longer of any use ; and those small parasitical fungi, com- 
monly called moulds, are some of the means employed by nature in removing 
that which has now become an encumbrance : — “ cut it down, why cumbereth 
it the ground ? ’’ 

The simple circumstance which set me to work must have been presented to 
the eyes of horticulturists thousands of times, but has passed unheeded in con- 
sequence of their disused closed frames being filled with weeds, instead of cu- 
cumbers and melons ; and I am quite ready to confess, that if some groundsel 
or chickweed had sprung up in my bottle instead of the fern, it would have 
made no impression upon me.

Equisetum hyemale. 

Root creeping, jointed, branched. Stems several from one branch of the 
root, or branched at the base, one to three feet high, or upwards, stout, erect or 
decumbent, articulated and fluted, occasionally throwing out catkins or very 
small branches near the top. Ridges or furrows fourteen to twenty-one in num- 
ber, in luxuriant specimens twenty-eight ; ridges grooved, and, as well as the 
furrows, grained like a file. Sheaths widest at top, at first pale green, with a 
black crenate rim ; afterwards entirely black ; ultimately white, with a broad 
black band at the base, the rim remaining black as before. The uppermost 
sheaths of the root generally., and the upper and lower of the younger stems oc- 
casionally., bear black, membranous, flexuose, deciduous teeth or bristles. The 
sheath of the catkin is invariably and persistently toothed. Catkins terminal, 
more rarely lateral, and in that case either single or in opposite pairs.

two and a half feet high, consisting of articulations from one to two and a half 
inches in length. The older stems frequently throw out long slender branches, 
which generally bear catkins. The stems are fluted, the ridges grooved, and 
both ridges and furrows grained, as in E. hyemale. Number of ridges or fur- 
rows eight to twelve. Sheaths cylindrical, at first pale or yellowish green, with 
a narrow black band immediately under the teeth ; ultimately wholly black, with 
the lower border of the black entire. Teeth equal in number to the ridges, mem- 
branaceous, white at the edge, long and tapering, terminating in a flexuose bris- 
tle which is generally black but sometimes white, in which case the white mar- 
gin of the teeth is broader: they often adhere in pairs, and are decidedly per- 
sistent. Catkins terminal, either on the stems or on the branches.

Root creeping, jointed, branched. Stems many, three to twenty inches long, 
branched at the base and upwards, generally but not invariably decumbent and 
filiform, rather brittle, consisting of numerous fluted articulations, half an inch 
to an inch and a half long. Ridges or furrows five to nine, the former grooved, 
and both grained as in E. hyemale and E. Mackaii. Sheaths slightly swollen 
upwards, the upper half black. Lower border of the black waved or toothed, the

dentations alternating with the teeth, and, like them, equal in number to the 
ridges. The teeth are distinct, never adhering, obtuse, somewhat ovate, black 
in the centre, with a broad, white, membranous margin, and tipped with a short 
bristle, which is either black or white, and more or less deciduous, while the 
teeth themselves are persistent. Catkins terminal, rather large in proportion to 
the size of the plant. 

These descriptions are intended to apply to the plants only “ as found on the 
banks and in the bed of the river Dee,” and as seen either with the naked eye 
or through a small lens. I have endeavoured to exclude everything that could 
not with propriety be admitted as a specific distinction. The characters which 
I have given, and which I find to be constant, * * * 

have led me to the conclusion that the three plants are well entitled to be 
ranked as distinct species. I conceive that the main strength of my posi- 
tion lies in the fact, that amidst all the varieties of size and shape which 
each plant presents, the distinctive characters remain the same. The species 
never shade off into one another, the smallest specimen of the largest species 
being readily distinguished from any specimen of the other two ; while, on 
the other hand, the stoutest stems of E. Mackaii and variegatum can at once be 
recognized as distinct from each other, and from the slenderer stems of E. 
hyeniale.

Observations on the Linnean Specimens of Equisetum. By Edward 
Newman. (From ^The Phytologist/ p. 530). 

It is, I believe, generally known that the Linnean herbarium was purchased 
by Sir J. E. Smith, and subsequently by the Linnean Society of London, in 
whose possession it now remains. The specimens are fixed on half sheets of 
foolscap paper; they are named by Linneus himself, in his own handwriting, 
and have also the comments of Sir J. E. Smith, wherever it appeared to him 
necessary or useful to add an explanatory note, A few labels with MS. notes 
are pasted in, but I am not certain of their author. The Equiseta are com- 
prised in a fasciculus of nine folios : the fasciculus is endorsed thus, — “ 1169, 
Equisetum,” in the handwriting of Linneus. 

In the same apartment are preserved the author’s own copies of the first and 
second editions of the ‘ Species Plantarum.’ In the first all the species possess- 
ed by the author are distinguished by a particular mark ; and the second is en- 
riched with his own unpublished notes. I will now endeavour to combine the 
information obtained from these several sources, only quoting the published cha- 
racters when requisite, and adding remarks of my own on every specimen.

E. N. — It is clear that Linneus trusts to Ray as the authority for this as a 
distinct species, since he quotes his figure,* which evidently represents the un- 
branched form of Eq. limosum of Smith. Hence it seems that Eq. fluviatile of 
Linneus is the branched, and Eq. limosum the unbranched form of Eq. limo- 
sum of Smith ; and that Eq. fluviatile of Smith has no representative either in 
the herbarium or the works of Linneus. With respect to the observation of 
Linneus quoted above, that Haller makes this species a variety of Equisetum 
palustre, I think the criticism is an unjust one. Haller quotes Ray’s figure 3, 
and, as it seems to me, correctly, as a variety of Equisetum palustre ; while Lin- 
neus quotes Ray’s figure 2, which is evidently the Eq. limosum of Smith. A 
positive proof that the fluviatile of Linneus was not the fluviatile of Smith, ex- 
ists in the fact that he attempted to account for its increased size and altered 
appearance by its growing from the bottom of deep water ; this is the case with 
Smith’s limosum, but never with his fluviatile, which, on the contrary, affects 
loose gravelly and sandy places unconnected with water.

I think the above notes will be sufficient to show that as regards several spe- 
cies of Equisetum, more especially the present, generally known as palustre, the 
Linnean herbarium is not a sure guide. There is, however, much collateral evi- 
dence that Linneus was not only acquainted with the Equisetum palustre of 
modern authors, but that he referred to that species when he named the plant 
in question ; for he expressed states that his fluviatile (Smith’s limosum) may be 
a variety of palustre growing in deeper water. Now as he was so well acquaint- 
ed with fluviatile (Smith’s limosum), and possessed such good specimens, his 
judgment cannot be supposed so much in fault as to have referred it to arvense. 
The error must have arisen from a want of care in the selection of specimens 
for his herbarium. Moreover, the name palustre is now too universally em- 
ployed to admit of its being changed, without a better reason than a discrepancy 
which may have originated in carelessness. The same is not the case with 
fluviatile : I am decidedly of opinion that the name, in this instance, must be 
changed ; and I make the proposition previously to publishing the species, in 
order that I may be favoured with the opinions of those botanists who think 
otherwise. I propose restoring the Linnean name to the limosum of Smith, and 
sinking the name limosum to the rank of a variety ; thus : — 

Equisetum fluviatile, Linn. = Equisetum limosum, Smith. 

„ „ /3. limosum, with the stem quite simple, = Equisetum 

limosum, Linn. 

The species hitherto called fluviatile is already so well provided with names 
that it is difficult to determine which to select. It seems to be the Equisetum 
majus of Gerarde^ and Ray,j' the Eq. Telmateia of EhrhartJ and Flora Dani- 
ca,§ and the Eq. eburneum of Roth.||

On Woodsia, a 7iew Genus of Ferns. By Robert Brown, Esq.,F.R.S., 
Lib. L.S. (From tbe Linnean Transactions, xi. 170). 

There is perhaps no tribe of Cryptogamous plants which, since the time of 
Linneus, has received greater additions to its number of species, or more consi- 
derable improvements in its systematic arrangement than the Filices : and cer- 
tainly no botanist has so essentially contributed to those improvements as the 
President of this Society ; whose ingenious ‘ Essay on Dorsiferous Ferns’ may 
be justly considered as the groundwork of the more complete dissertations of 
Professors Swartz and Bernhardi, which have appeared since its publication.^ 

Linneus, in his latest work, the 13th edition of the ‘ Systema Vegetabilium,’ 
enumerates scarcely more than two hundred ferns, which he referred to twelve 
genera ; while the ‘ Species Plantarum ’ of the late Professor Willdenow con- 
tains upwards of a thousand plants of the same order, arranged under forty- 
three genera. It is, however, remarkable, that of this vast number of species 
nearly one half belong to four of the Linnean genera, namely. Polypodium, 
Acrostichum, Asplenium and Pteris, all of which were first proposed by Ray in 
his ‘ Methodus Plantarum Emendata,’ published in 1703 ; without names in- 
deed, but with characters nearly similar to those of Linneus. 

It appears, therefore, that the arrangement of Ferns at present universally 
followed is not wholly new : and that it has not attained such a degree of per- 
fection as to supersede all changes in nomenclature, may be inferred from the 
genus Polypodium alone, though reduced nearly one-half by its present charac- 
ter, still including a hundred and fifty seven species, or upwards of a seventh 
part of the whole order. 

The expediency of subdividing Polypodium, as well as some of the other 
genera mentioned, especially Acrostichum, is indeed obvious, not merely on ac- 
count of their great extent, but also from the striking differences in habit exist- 
ing among the species referred to each. 

I have some time agof had an opportunity of remarking that two plants re- 
ferred to Polypodium — P. ilvense and hyperhoreum, form a distinct genus from 
the peculiar structure of their involucrum, even the existence of which had es- 
caped preceding observers. 

This genus I have named in honour of my friend Mr. Joseph Woods, whose 
merits as an accurate and skilful English botanist, are well known to many of 
the members of this Society: and the object of the present communication is to

illustrate it by some additional observations on its structure, and by a very per- 
fect drawing, for which I am indebted to the friendship of Mr. Francis Bauer. 

The character distinguishing Woodsia from all other genera of Ferns hi- 
therto established, consists in its involucrum being inserted under the group of 
capsules, or, as it is technically called, the sorus, which it completely surrounds 
at the base, while it is in every stage open at the top, having its margin divided 
into a number of capillary segments, which from their length and incurvation 
entirely conceal the young capsules, and in a great measure the full grown. 

That so singular a structure should have been hitherto unnoticed, even 
though both species of the genus have been described and figured since the 
publication of Dr. Smith’s memoir, is not perhaps to be wondered at ; for the 
membranaceous base of the involucrum is completely concealed by the cap- 
sules, and the marginal hairs, which alone are visible, exactly resembling the 
pubescence of the frond, have been universally confounded with it. 

The difficulty, too, of separating the membrane entire from the frond, to 
which, by the pressure of the capsules, it is closely applied, is so considerable, 
that since the publication of my remarks already quoted, its existence has been 
doubted by a botanist whose opinion — especially in whatever regards this order 
of plants — is of peculiar weight, and in opposition to which I should not retain 
full confidence in my own observations, though frequently repeated, were they 
not so distinctly confirmed by Mr. Bauer’s excellent drawing. 

I first observed the involucrum six years ago in living plants of Woodsia 
hyperhorea, and have since repeatedly ascertained its existence in dried speci- 
mens of the same species, and of Woodsia ilvensis. These two plants are indeed 
so nearly related, that I find myself unable to construct for them clear specific 
characters ; and therefore, in proposing them here as distinct species, I am, 
from want of sufficient materials to determine the question, rather following the 
prevailing opinion than my own.

Capsules semina graniformia includentes subquadricoccaB revera bivalves, sed 
interdum quadrifarium dehig|eiites. Cocculi laterales simul inferius positi 
magisque ad latera protuberant quam cocculi medii altius positi. Semina 
semper quatuor, pro numero cocculorum, insertione sua convergentia et adeo 
compaginata ut mutua pressione areolae triangulares ternae in basi seminis sin- 
guli efFormantur, qua re adeo seminibus Iso'etidis lacustris simillima, ut dum 
etiam pluribus respectubus conveniunt hae plantae de earum affinitate vix dubi- 
tare licet ; magnitudine vix cedunt seminibus Papaveris, et semper integra e 
capsulis recedimt atque in terra dispertiuntur, quo dare patet ea antheras baud 
esse ut voluit Hedwigius. 

Capsules seminulis pulveraceis repletce in axillis foliorum superiorum inveni- 
untur, bivalves, eaeque simillimae capsulis fariniferis praecedentium specierum 
et Filicum bivalvium. Farina haec e granulis hispidulis efficitur, quorum qua- 
tuor in tetraedron connata sunt omnino ut semina capsularum inferiorum ; quo 
maxima analogia oritur amborum ut nullum sit dubium quin ejusdem indolis 
sint. Si itaque farina in capsulis Botrychii Lunarice semina sit, necesse est ut 
harum quoque capsularum pulvis vera semina erit. Pollen masculinum neuti- 
quam esse potest quum seminibus maturis nuper descriptis omnino coaetaneus 
est pulvis, idque in spica annua ; semina unicum pulvere cadunt mense Julii 
vel initio Augusti, quo facto tota spica perit, et nova insequente anno nascitur 
e surculis, cujus nunc vix vestigium adest. Surculos bos eodem tempore scru- 
pulose examinavi nec reperire potui minimum vestigium capsularum futurarum. 
Exinde sententia probabilior fieri mihi videtur, quod capsulae hae fariniferae 
fructum quoque constituunt cujus seminula nonnisi minutie sua a caeteris semi- 
nibus differunt uti semina Spinaciae diversae formas occurrunt. 


Advertisement. — It should perhaps in conclusion he ob- 
served that the present volume is in some measure a second 
edition of my ^History of British Ferns, published in 1840 ; 
but the alterations have been so great, and the additions so vo- 
luminous, that the two works must, 1 think, rank as perfectly 
distinct. I did not, however, venture on the present publication 
until the earlier volume had long been out of print.
