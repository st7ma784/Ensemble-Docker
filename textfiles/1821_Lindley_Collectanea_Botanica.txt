The seeds of this truly magnificent plant were received, seven or eight years ago, from Mexico by Mr. Lamb 



stove at Boyton, in the autumn of last year, it produced flow 



for the first time, probably, in Europ 



From its peculiar mode of growth, it is impossible for any drawing to give an adequate idea of the appearance it th 



presented. Let the reader imagine to himself a plant about three feet hi<rh, formed of 



mass of leaves shaped like 



permost of an intensely brilliant 






of the common pine-apple, but from three to five feet long ; let the lowest be of a dull dark-green, and the up 

the wllole surmounted by a pyramidal tuft of flowers of the most exquisitely 
delicate crimson ; and a faint idea may then be formed of the superb appearance of Bromelia fastuosa in perfection. 

Not t0 mention the length of time during which the scarlet leaves remain both 

/ 

the flowers continue to open daily 
In favourable situations, too, they 



Nor are these beauties ephemer 
before and after flowe 



in 



and which, indeed, only perish with the plant itself 
long succession, and, even in decay, exhibit traces of their former grandeur, 
doubtless would be succeeded by fruit inferior only in beauty to themselves. 

It is an undescribed species, resembling in some respects Bromelia paniculigera and bracteata of Swartz 



which, besides other differ 



much smaller plants. Its habit is that of true B 



mean 



both of 
consti- 



tuted by Plumier ; and, surely, is so different from that of the pine-apple, his Ananassa, that we can scarcely doubt 
propriety of considering them distinct genera. But at present we have no opportunity of ascertaining the respective 
hrmts, and distinctive characters, if such there be, of each. We can, therefore, only call the attention of those to the 
subject who may have more ample means of investigating the whole order than we are so fortunate as to possess 

Mr. Lambert has suggested to us, and we think with great propriety, that this is the plant figured by Baron Hum- 
boldt in the fore-ground of the forty-first plate of the Atlas Pittoresque, growii

If we were requested to select the most interesting from the multitude of vegetable tribes, we should, on the whole, 
perhaps, be willing to give the preference to the natural order of Orchidese. Whether we consider general elegance 
of individuals, durability of blossoms, splendid colours, delicious perfume, or extraordinary structure, it would be dif- 
ficult to select any order superior to Orchidese in these respects, and few even equal to them. To the cultivator, who 
esteems plants for their beauty only; to the botanist, who, rejecting outward attractions, is chiefly captivated by ano- 



s 



A 



C 



malous structure, or intricate organization ; or to the amateur, who wisely prefers to have these requisites combined ; 
to all, or any of these, we conceive that accurate figures of foreign Orchideous plants cannot fail to be particularly 

* 

acceptable. We therefore propose to publish one species of this family in each succeeding number ; and we hope 
to be able soon to add such important information with respect to the treatment of Orchideag, as will entirely remove 



the present difficulty of cultivating them, and as may enable any one to manage them as readily as the most common

We are obliged to Mr. Griffin for the communication of this very curious little parasitical plant, Which flowered in 

â€” â€¢ % 

his stove, last July, immediately after its arrival from Trinidad. 

It is perhaps of the same genus as some supposed species of Cranichis ; but does not appear to have been hitherto 
taken up by botanical writers. ' It, however, differs from Cranichis, and from every other genus of the same section, 
in the characters we have assigned it above. The curious manner in which the segments of the perianthium are 

- 

united, â€” the two lateral outer ones and the inferior outer and lateral inner segments partially cohering in two divi- 



/ 



\. 



( 



\ 



sions, which are themselves slightly connected towards their base, â€” is very remarkable. Something analogou; 

- 

takes place in Masdevallia, Restrephia, Pleurothallis , &c. which are otherwise very different. 

We have described the flowers as not resupinate ; agreeably to Mr. Brown's very ingenious and correct idea, that 

* * fc 

the Labellum becomes the lowest segment in Orchis, Ophrys, &c, from a twist of the Ovarium, or of its stalk, and 



/ 



that, therefore, the flowers of those genera are in reality resupinate, properly speaking; and not those which, like 
the present plant, have the Labellum above the Columna.

We are much gratified by having an opportunity of publishing this exceedingly rare and curious North A 
plant. Our figure is taken from very complete specimens gathered near Quebec by Mr. John Go 
who first described it, appears to have had imperfect materials for examination : 



Mr. N 



for he describes his plant as entirely 



destitute of leaves, which, nevertheless, are undoubtedly present under the form of scales, clothing the stem 



bably might be cultivated in peat soil among other American plants ; and its very pretty flowers, and curious app 

would make it no contemptible addition to our botanical riches from that quarter of the world

Mr. Nuttall refers it to his natural order of Monotropeae, which 



b 



better called Pyrole^:, al 



with Monotropa, Hypopitys and Schweinitzia ; but he does not absolutely include Pyrola, notv, ithstandiog its evideiU 
affinity with the other genera, and especially with Pterospora. In the somewhat inaccurate character of the 



hich Mr. Nuttall has given, the structure of 



seeds is not described 



the propriety of placing it and Pyrola near each other in any

establishes beyond doubt 



The embryo is very 



apparently undivided

Gaertner describes that of Pyrola to be, and like it placed at

upon Pyrola. He 



embryo of 

b 



figured the embryo of the latter as at that end of the seed which is next the hilum. After a most careful ax a i n i nation 
of Pterospora, it appears to us that its structure is just the reverse ; ar 



albumen which is furthest removed from the hilum 
of Pterospora in other respects, that we entertain

d that its embryo is at that 



doubt 



of the resemblance equally existing in th 



extremity of the 
ery similar to that 



therefore disposed to question the correctness of the observations of ourselves or G 



We 



blance of the two genera; especially as the extreme minuteness of th 



of the embryo is derived, is such as fully to justify us in our uncertainty 



parts, from which the 



more minute cha-

In our Tab. 1, we have figured and described a very remarkable plant of the natural order of llromvlice, for which 
we were obliged to Mr. Lambert. We are now happy to have an opportunity of publishing a still rarer plant of the 






same splendid tribe, which flowered in the hothouse with Messrs. Loddiges a few months ago, to whom we are 
obliged for permission to figure it. It is a native of the mountains of Peru, where it was found growing- upon trees 
by Ruiz and Pavon. We have not yet seen it in any other collection than that of Messrs. Loddiges. 

_ 

The genus has been named by the authors of the Flora Peruviana, as they inform us, after Signor Anastatio 
Gusman, an industrious apothecary, and zealous collector of the plants and other natural productions of South Ame- 
rica. It was originally published by them with the inharmonious name of Pourretia sympaganthera ; but, in the 
Flora Peruviana itself, has been placed as a distinct genus under the name we have adopted. The curious manner 
in which its anthers cohere, affords an obvious distinction between it and the other genera of the order. But the 
whole structure of the flower is highly deserving of attention. On account not only of the thick substance of the 
limb of the inner divisions of the perianth, and their membranous delicate tube, but of the extreme thinness of the 
filaments, which are wholly incapable of supporting the anthers, nature has given a hard cartilaginous texture to the 



outer segments, which enables them, by their contraction, to bear up those parts which require support, and which, 
without this provision, would be incapable of performing their necessary functions. Between the outer and inner 
series of the flower, a considerable quantity of honey is secreted. 

While we are upon this subject, we cannot avoid recommending most strongly to the attention of those who are 
accustomed to import tropical plants, and especially to such as are more particularly in correspondence with persons 
in the West Indies, the numerous splendid species of Bromeliaceous plants which abound in those regions, and 
which are scarcely known in Europe more than by name. Not to mention their beauty, the facility with which they 
may be transported from place to place, and the readiness with which they adapt themselves to our mode of culture, 
render them peculiarly desirable. 

_ 

The genera Bromelia and Tillandsia alone contain many species which might be procured without difficulty, and 
which would not suffer by comparison with the finest plants we at present possess.

same state as it was when the genus was first founded. 




Willdenow and Persoon have both erroneously referred it to Dicecia, we know not upon what authority ; for 

â–  

certainly bears male and female flowers upon the same plant. M. de Jussieu has considered it allied in natural affinity 
to Buxus, next which he has placed it; an idea, which the structure of the female flowers, with which, as we have 
already observed, he was unacquainted, does not seem to confirm, 

Its name was derived from the excessive hardness of its wood, which is so compact as to resist the blows of the axe, 
and is called Bois dur by the colonists at the Isle of Prance, 
duced to this country, in the year 1793, by Rear-Admiral BIiÂ°h.

To avoid the imputation of foreing upon the world, delineations of vegetables which have been already , orrec 
and completely published by others, it is intended in the present work to figure none which ba> e befor ppeared in 
the popular productions of the day, unless for the purpose of explaining some novel fact in their hi >ry, <>r structure, 
which may render such a measure justifiable. The materials already collected for the use of the wor! re con iderable ; 
and from the assurance he has received of support from his numerous friends in the vicinity of London, the author 
confidently ventures to anticipate an uninterrupted succession of novelties. 



For the convenience of those who may favour the work with communications of suffiei nt extent to render itdesir- 
able, the plan, first proposed by Dr. looker in his elegant Musci Exotici, will be followed, of In uling each page with 
a -.running title (such as Lcmihertian^yCattleianae, Qriffinian <e , %c.) expressive of the collection from which the subject 
of H was received. Purchasers will then have an opportunity of binding up the figures of their own plants separately.

It was originally intended that a few copies should have been prepared with plates more highly finished than those 



of the common sets: but Subscribers are respectfully informed, that on more mature con (deration it has b i 
deemed advisable that this part of the plan should be relinquished. No other copic will therefore b deliver

, For this fine addition to our collections of Liliaceous plants, the public is indebted to Mr. Brookes of Newington, 
who lately imported it, with several other rare plants, from Cayenne. Our drawing was made from a plant in the 
possession of W. Cattley, Esq. 



Notwithstanding the great and striking difference between this plant and Amaryllis vittala in (lie llowers, there is 
an astonishing similarity in the leaves, by which alone the plants certainly cannot be distinguished. In addition to the 
extraordinary length of the perianth, which has considerable resemblance to that of Solatidra grandi flora, (here is a 
wide difference in the stigma, which in the present plant is obtusely 3-lobed, and in A. vittala deeply trilid. We un- 
derstand that Mr. Brookes has other bulbs of this species, the flowers of which are streaked w nh crimson, by which 
they are much improved in beauty, and show yet more strongly the affinity of the plant to A. vittala, which there is 
every reason to believe is also a native of the same continent ; from whence it has been repeatedly received by our 

splendid variety represented in our next 

plate has also been obtained. 

A. Solandraflora undoubtedly belongs to that set of plants which has been indicated by Mr. Herbert, in some 
marks on the genera of Amaryllidece lately published in the Botanical Magazine, as constituting what he considers 



friend Mr. Griffin under its common appearance ; and from whence the s

The subject of this article is another of the magnificent Liliaceous pi

America., acquired by tl 



wearied exertions of W. Griffin, Esq. who has succeeded in importing; so many species of that his favourite family 
within a few years. It was procured several years ago from Brazil, and, though assuredly only a variety of A. vit

Thisandthe preceding plant have naturally led us to the consideration of the principles upon which certain alter- 
ations have been made by Mr. Herbert in Amaryllis, and the genera allied to it; which we \\ ill first endeavour to 
explain, and then proceed to examine. The ardour, and we believe we may add success, \\ .th \\ h

We hardly know whether or not the plant we now figure ought to be considered a distinct species from the Car- 
denia tubijlora of the Botanist's Repository, It certainly differs from that in many particulars, especially in its much 

size. We have examined specimens brought from Sierra Leone by Smeathman, and preserved in the Hank-

Specimens of this most splendid plant in excellent preservation were sent from the East Indies by Dr. Wallich, to 



A. B. Lambert, Esq. under the name we have quoted above. From one of these our draw ing lias been taken. 



It 



appears to form a tree, like many others of the same showy family. Its heads of flowers are produced in such abun- 
dance from among the ample foliage, that we think, if Rafflesia be excepted, it must be one of the most superb plants 
in the world. Malvaceae usually afford their seeds very readily, so that no difficulty need be anticipated in obtaining 
the plant. We hope soon to see it ornamenting our hothouses as commonly as the beautiful and once highly prized 
Hibiscus Rosa Sinensis. 



We have already observed that Dr. Wallich referred the subject of this article to Pentapetes. In a subsequent 
communication he has transferred it to Dombeya. To us it seems to differ much 
they do from each other, not only in general appearance, but in technical characters. Not to mention the great 



more from those two genera than 






double involucrum of Astray <z a, which is at least of as much importance as the brae tea?, or outer calyx as the\ 



usu- 



ally are termed, of many genera of this order, Dombeya and Pentapetes have 



an outer calyx of three leaves; 



Astrapcea has none, but in its room one large bractea which subtends the calyx properly so called ; Dombn/a and 
Pentapetes have an almost expanded corolla ; Astrapcsa has its petals rolled together like Achania. ' There is a dif- 
ference too in the number of stamens ; but this perhaps is not of so much consequence as the great length of their 
tube, as compared with the shallow cup of Pentapetes and Dombeya. The same observations are applicable to Pte- 



rospermum (the Pentapetes of Jussieu) ; but that has neither bractea, nor outer calyx ; its fl 

its whole habit very different. Whether the seeds of Astrapcsa are winged or not we have 
except from the ovula, which exhibit no trace of any appendao- e . 
thin, rather than of a woody texture. 



o\\ ers are solitary, and 

no means of judging, 

The ovarium appears to be that of a capsule of a

possible to ascertain what that method is, we have ourselves framed a character which will serve to distin-

One of the many objects which occupy the attention of the Horticultural Society is the introduction of ornamental 
plants to the gardens of this country, and the free distribution of them when procured ; a purpose which the rare 
union of wealth, interest and liberality, which it possesses, cannot fail to ensure its attaining most successfully. The 
knowledge of what plants of this description particular regions produce, was obviously one step towards obtaining 
them. But as it is difficult to form a very correct idea of their beauty from the appearance they assume when dried, in 
which state only a great proportion of tropical vegetables is known to residents in Europe, it was determined by the 
Society that a person should be employed in making drawings of plants in the countries where they grow. For several

he object of this work is to exhibit accurate figures, accompanied by ample botanical illustrations, of the rare or 

i 

curious, or otherwise interesting plants which are either now cultivated in the gardens of Great Britain, or which it 
may be hereafter desirable to introduce. The drawings will be prepared by the author. The plates will contain all 



details of the parts of fructification wh 



may be possible to procure ; and it is hoped that, from this circum 



stance, they will not only be entitled to as high a degree of importance as any illustrative of botanical subjects, in this 
country, can claim :; but, from the ample explanations to be given of them in the text, that they will offer an easy, and 
at the same time pleasing, introduction to the knowledge of vegetable organization. 

To avoid the imputation of forcing upon the world, delineations of vegetables which have been already 
completely published by others, it is intended in the present work to figure none which ha\e

The only account which has hitherto been published of this fine shrub is in the Transactions of the Horticultural 
Society, where Mr.Cattley has given a complete history of its introduction, and of the mode of its cultivation. A beau- 
tiful figure of the plant in a fruit-bearing state accompanies the memoir, which Mr. Sabine completed by naming the 






subject of it in honour of the gentleman by whom the plant was first brought into notice

its stamens inserted 



all th

to constitute a Psidium. The principal features by which it is characterized, are 
inner surface of the calyx, its capitate stigma, peculiar mode of placentation, true berry containing many seeds with 
an osseous covering;, and an embryo curved like a ^orse-shoe, with very minute cotyledons. There is also a curious 
contrivance in its testa, by which the emission of the radicle, otherwise likely to be retarded, if not prevented, by the 
very hard nature of its covering, is greatly facilitated. Immediately over against the lower extremity of the embryo, 
a circular portion of the testa, with a diameter equal to that of the radicle, acquires such a tendency to separate from 
the rest that the first effort of incipient germination suffices to loosen it, and finally to push it out ; just as the action

There is another genus bordering close upon Psidium, and which it has even been proposed to unite with it 



\\ 



mean Campomanesia of Ruiz and Pavon. For the opportunity of inspecting the unpublished figure of this exceed 



ly rare plant, destined for a future' volume of the Fiord Peruviana, we are as usual indebted to our very 



lib

a 



I 



friend Mr. Lambert, who has also 

i 

fortune to possess. The result of our investigation has proved highly 



most kindly permitted us to examine a portion of its fruit, which h 



th 



factory. The genus proves to possess very 



decided marks of difference from Psidium, both in the insertion of stamens, and in the seed, which has 



ft 



of which are replete 



and an embryo with cotyledons as long as the radicle and coiled up

deservedly celebrated, has shown the necessity of establishing for this g 



new natural order, whichhe

the addition of Ascarina of Forster, and Tafalla of Ruiz and Pavon, which is Swartz's Hedy "~ ' 




He adds, that 



it agrees with both the orders just mentioned cc in having the radicle of the embryo in a direction opposite to the 



bilicus 






d a one-seeded ovarium ; but differs especially in its pendulous ovulum and habit 






/ 



There seems to be much 



uncertainty about its place in the Linnean system. Dr. Sims, at the suggestion 
of Mr. Brown, has referred it to Monandria. But of the four known species, one only can by any means be considered 






monandrous, and it may be doubted whether even that is really 



In the plant before us, the middle anth 



seems 



to us to be made up of two confluent anthers, the original separation of which is indicated by the fissure of their apex 

and consequently we do not think the lateral ones imperfect, but only incompletely united with the middle anther. This 

species may therefore be considered tetrandrous, as may inconspicuus also ; and according to this hypothesis Mr 



Bro 



wn 



C. monander, which we suppose to be the same as a plant we saw in flower at Kew 






its single stamen made up of two confluent 



months since, h 



which is in some measure confi 



ed by the presence of 



fu 



rrow 



running all down the axis of the filament in the inside. It appears therefore, that whatever opinion be held, the sta 
tion of the genus in the system of Linnaeus is equally doubtful; for the union of filaments 



make it 



to place it in Monadelphia, the cohesion of anthers would refer it to Syngenesia, or its absolutely monandrous sti 



ture to Monandi

This tree, which is known in the gardens by the improper name of Eugenia Amboinemis, seems to be what 



duces the iron wood of the East Indies 



pi 






In the islands of the Indian Archipelago it is called Nani, and is described 
under that name by Francis Valentyn in his account of the island of Amboyna. Rumphius, whom we believe to be 
the only author that has given a detailed account of the plant, says that it grows to a considerable size, forming a large 
timber tree in the rocky parts of Amboyna and Java ; he adds that the wood from the heart of the tree is so 
sively hard, that it is impossible to work it except in a green state. The Chinese make their rudders and anchoi 



exces- 



which are esteemed by them superior to the iron ones of the Europ 



The worm is said not to eat into it, as it does 



into other woods with a similarly close grain. Although harder than ebony, it does not take so fine a polish. Among 

The 



the Japanese it is so scarce and valuable, that it is only allowed to be manufactured in the service of their kin

parates spontaneously from the tree, is used by the natives as a remedy for fluor albus and diarrhoea

It must be obvious to every 




y 



Eusrenia fi 



attended to tbe subject, that it is almost impossible to disting 



o 



other by the characters hitherto attributed to them 



the fruit, on which 






their differences are chiefly said to depend, is within reach for examination. We conceive, however, that the difficulty 
of which we have spoken, does not arise out of any want of characters in nature to distinguish these plants, whicl 
probably have as strict, if not stricter limits than those of most Natural Orders ; but rather from a laxness and'incom 
pleteness in the definitions of authors, who 



have 



troduced 



fus 



w 



ith all the characters of one genus to anoth 



_ them by carelessly referring plants 
d from each group having been crowded with species which differ 



much from the genera in which they have been placed, as those genera do from each oth 



Their difference has hitherto depended entirely upon the fruit 



fact it always must. We believe, however, 



it will be discovered that it is neither the pericarpium, nor the number of its cells, nor the number of the seeds 
1 afford sufficient distinsTiishine* characters : 




but rather the structure of the ovarium as regards the placentation of 
ovula, and the various modifications of embryo. 

If our ideas of the genus Myrtus are to be derived from the common Myrtle of the gardens, it will be characterized 
a straight style, a 2-3-celled ovarium containing many ovula attached all round a thin central placenta, and by 



seeds with 



s 



i e n d 



arcuate embryo, of which the radicle is about twice as long as the cotyledons ; and all the specie 



ffer from it in these respects will probably be referable to oth 



genera 



As there is, however, considerable 



fficulty in procuring specimens of the fruit of many Myrti in our herbaria, it 



which really 



belong 



possible at present to 



tain 



to Myrtus, properly speaking, and which do not. We may nevertheless observe, that in placen- 
tation M. tenuifolia, latifolia, and cerasina, agree with it ; and that the plant called M. Pimenta latifolia in the gar- 
dens has its ovula inserted in a similar way, but on a fungous placenta. 

As Myrtus disticha with the same sort of placentation has a hooked style, and seeds without any distinction of 



dicle and 



tyledons, it may 



stand as a section of Myrtus, and 



to consider it as the type of anothe 



could describe a cylindrical arcuate embry

The Allspice plant of the West Ind 



igo considered a distinct genus by Dr. S 



has called 






it Myrcia in his Manuscripts. It has a straight style, a stigma somewhat capitate, an ovary with two cells, each 



taining a single 



of Myrtus 



My 



m hanging by its middle from the top of the dissepiment, its seeds solitary, with the organization 
being very near Myrsine in sound, we would propose that the specific be altered to a generic 



ppellation, and that the plant be called Pimenta officinalis

Undoubtedly these will constitute another genus 



hen their fruit shall have been examined. From the appearance of the impregnated ovule, we should judge th 
eds to be like those of Myrtus. M. tomentosa has the same structure of ovarium, but its habit is very different. 
Eugenia has exactly the same placentation as true Myrtus, but is distinguished by its very rigid stamen 



quite different from the weak distorted 



of the other genera, and by its seeds (usually 1 or 2) having a transversely 



oblong embryo with very large fleshy cotyledons, including within their base a small conical radicle ; and so diff

For tbis rare parasitical plant we are obliged to Messrs. Loddi 
Botanical Cabinet. It is a native of the West India Islands, 



b 



who have already given a figure of it 



their 









The anthers of the specimen we examined were mostly in an empty state 



pollen masses there seemed to b 



and in those which had produced th 



unnatural formation 






â–  

which did not bear the appearance of having been injured 



th 



of the anth 



for we could not succeed in detecting a single pollen mass 

â–  

In some instances!, however, the mass seemed to fill up 



in other Dendrob 



It is therefore not unlikely that the number of pollen masses is always two, instead of four as 
a which case it may be necessary to divide this plant from the genus ; a measure which its 



peculiar habit strongly recommends

calyx, into the upper edge of which the stamens are inserted.

O 



cannot

avoid remarking the resemblance between its calyx and the squama of Amenlacece, and Ulmacece. Ficoidece, Grossu 
lacece and Cacti, on account of placentation and structure of seed, may be supposed to have a certain relation to it : 
as may Chenopodece with regard to inflorescence, absence of petals and habit. But we are disposed to believe its real 
place in the system is in the neighbourhood of Euphorbiacece, where we have placed it in Flora Scotica. They agree 
with it in having the same sort of aggregation of flowers, similar habit, no corolla, and ternary division of ovarium. 
The insertion of their ovula is the same, as is also the direction of the radicle. They differ, however, Firstly, in the 
presence of albumen ; which yet is not entirely absorbed in Reseda till the seed is perfectly ripe, and which exists 
even after that time in the seed of R. alba, when it is fleshy as in Euphorbiacece >. Secondly, in their solitary seeds ; 
in which respect Resedacece may be supposed to bear the same relation to Euphorbiacece as C amp anulacece do to

However 



much our specimen may appear to differ from Jacquin's figure of his Reseda Mediterranea, we bel 



ght in referring it to that species, on the authority of a specimen in the Banksian herbarium, in a state 



it precisely resembles our plant 



It seems to be very near Reseda lutea, from which it chiefly differ 



ab 



*\ 



of "roughness in the stem, of hairs on the stamens, and of hispidity on the ovarium. Messrs. Loddiges communicated 

the plant from which our figure was taken. 

In Dr. Hooker's Flora Scotica, in characterizing M. Decandolle's order of Reseoace/e, we have offered an entirely 



r hypothesis respecting the nature of the floral envelopes of Reseda ; but as we had not an op 



t 



j 



tunity of expl 



Tbe usual idea of the 11 



ing our ideas in detail in that work, we shall take the opportunity of do 

Reseda has been that it is furnished with a calyx of a variable number of divisions, with as many petals produci 



of 



Â£> 



y and stamens inserted on a great fleshy bod} 



j 



from their surface certain anomalous appendages, and with an ova 
called nectary by Linnaean botanists, squama by others, and raised to the rank of a distinct organ by M. Mirbel un- 
der the name of Gynophore. To us, however, it has always appeared that this could by no means be the real struc- 
ture of the plant, and that by a slight alteration of terms it not only might be much more satisfactorily explained, but 
its real affinity ascertained with some degree of probability. For even allowing for a moment an analogy between 



the nectary of this plant and the discus of others, particularly of some Tiliacece, there is still a great difficulty remain 



ing to be overcome in the anomalous structure of 



pposed petals, of which we can imagine no probable 




nation. 

We are therefore of opinion that a much more natural mode of understanding Reseda is to consider it as having 

compound flowers ; taking the calyx of authors for an involucrum, their petals for neutral florets, and their nectary 

for the calyx of a, fertile floret in the middle. In support of this opinion we may observe ; Firstly, that there is a 

difference in the time of expansion of the neutral florets and of the stamens of the fertile one ; the former being quite 

open in very many capituli before one anther of the latter has burst in a single flower. Secondly, that there is an 

evident analogy between the appendages of the neutral florets, and the stamens of the perfect florets ; inasmuch as 



in Reseda odorata those of the upper sterile florets are of nearly the same number as the real stamens ; because in 
Reseda alba, and some others, in which a union of filaments takes place in the perfect floret, there is a corresponding 
but more complete union of the sterile appendages ; and because occasionally, in Reseda odorata, stamens are 

* 

changed into bodies altogether similar to the sterile appendages; and in Reseda Phyteuma the same appearance is al-

In tbe recent elaborate monograph of Papaveracece by M. Decandolle, we find no mention made of this plant ; 



which is undoubtedly distinct from Papaver orientate, although very similar to it at first sight. 
month earlier, it is obviously distinguished by the great bracteae which surround the base of the fl

It sometimes varies with five instead of four petals, which 

account we have represented it in that state, that the fact may not be neglected. 

The calyx is pushed off by the corolla when expanding, without any disunion of the 

made up. In rainy or cloudy weather, or at night, the petals close over the stamens, and thus afford thei 

tual protection. 

Tournefort says the Turks eat the green heads of Papaver orientate, although excessively acrid. 
Mr. Anderson communicated our specimens from the Physic Garden at Chelsea ; where he has, by his i 

i 

assiduity, formed perhaps the finest and most interesting collection of hardy herbaceous plants ever in tl 
He informs us that he has received it three different times from Dr. Fischer : first in 1818 under the name of Papaver 
orientate specio sum : secondly in 1819 by the name of Papaver orientate pulckerrimum : and thirdly in 1821 as 
Papaver orientale grandiflorum.

further consideration, we find our drawing differs from it in so many respects, that we offer no apology for publish 
ing it again. 

As a genus, it differs from Ornithogahtm and Scilla in having a perianthium only partly divided, instead of on 
separated into six divisions ; and in'the union of the filaments into a hollow cone, which arises from the summit c 
the short cup of the perianthium. But in the coherence of the stamens it is not so distinct from Ornithogalum as it 
at first sight appears to be ; for certain species of that genus have filaments protruding on each side beyond the an- 
thers, and conniving into a similar cone. In these, however, there is no actual union of their edges, so that the cha- 
racters ofPuschkinia would still be good, even if the perianthium were absolutely the same as in Ornithogalum. 

There is a curious and very unusual circumstance attending the vegetation of this plant, which we ought not to 



omit to mention 

ft 



The two first 



appear are broad, flat, and concave, as in Scilla sibirica 



but those 



which come up afterwards are cylindrical, of the thickness of a crow-quill, and solid like the leaves of a rush 
proceed from the side of the broad leaves, and possibly may belong to newly formed bulbs ; 
portunity of ascertaining.

This is one of the genera established by Mr. Brown in the last edition of the Hortus K 



It was named after 



Mr. John Goodyer, a Hampshire botanist mentioned in Gerarde's Herbal 
repens of Europe, and the Neottia pubescens of Willdenow 



and was founded upon the old Saty 



Sir James Smith has -Wen it as his opinion that Goodyera is not distinct from Neottia of Brown ; an assertion 






hich we apprehend he will be induced, after more mature consideration 



to retract. If Ophrys spiralis be consi- 



dered the type of Neottia of Brown, or of Richard's Spiranthes, as it undoubtedly must be, certain tropical plants re 
ferred to it being excluded, a very natural group of plants is formed, differing equally in habit and technical charac 



ters from Goody 



The latter genus has an inflated lip han 



down, and forming a very obtuse angle with 



columna : a transverse, slightly apiculate gynizus 



d a nearly sessile anther with angular pollen. Spiranthes 



the contrary, has a shovel-shaped lip, parallel with the columna, and furnished at its 



base on each side with a tub 



cle, by modifications of which, the sp 



e 



may be satisfactorily distinguished; a narrow, sometimes subulate gynizus ; 



and a pedicellate anther with round pollen 



We prefer retaining M. Richard 



name *: 



Spiranthes, b 



Neo 



& 



should rather be applied to the Nidus Avis, referred to his Listera by Mr. Brown, but differing from that 
to say, from Ophrys ovata and cordata, both in habit and structure.

This plant has been improperly considered the Theophrasta americana of Linnaeus, not only by botanists in this 
untry, but even by M. de Jussieu himself; as we have ascertained by specimens most liberally communicated to 



by 



friend M. Desfontaines. That plant, however, which probably has 



been seen by any one since 



and from 



Plumier from whose account of it the characters of Linnaeus were taken, will be found on examination to be not only 
specifically, but even generically, distinct from the plant before us. 

Plumier describes his Eresia as a tree with the simple stem of a palm, bearing its leaves at the summit; 
his figure it appears that the flowers are disposed in long spikes growing from the centre of the leaves ; they seem to 
be small, with a limb of the same length as the tube of the corolla. Our plant, on the contrary, has a stem one or 
two feet'high, flowers growing in short corymbose upright racemes from the centre of the leaves, and a corolla with 
the tube very'much shorter than the limb. In only one of these particulars does Eresia agree with our plant, and that 



of little comparative importance 



namely, in the place from whence the flowers proceed 



But if the apparent characters of Eresia be compared with certain species of the genus Clavija of the Flora Peru- 
viana, the resemblance will be found so great, that there can be no doubt of their generic identity ; notwithstanding 
certain differences in Plumier's figures of the flowers of his plant 

/ 

ably be placed 



which, we conceive, no confiden 



Their structure 



Of Clavija we have been permitted by Mr. Lambert to examine the flowers of several species 
so extremely different from that of the plant which M. Jussieu described, that we imagine no one can now contemplate 
the possibility of their all belonging to the sam - 

th 



which that profound botanist formerly conjectured might b 



J 



We have subjoined the characters of Clavija, of which Mr. Lambert possesses many fine species. Jacquin

p/imsta longifolia must be referred to it ; and is possibly, as Sir James Smith has supposed, the very same plant 
Plumier's Eresia. It is probable that the Theophr astce macrophylla, latifolia, and pungens of Romer 



d Schultz 






species of Clavija. But whether the T. madagascariensis of the same authors, and pinnata of Jacquin, be re- 
ferable to it also, is not equally certain. 

Having thus pointed out the generic differences of the Theophrastce of Jussieu and Linnaeus, it remains to be 
determined with which plant the name ought to remain. As that of Linnaeus was first published, it would, according 
to the usual manner of settling such affairs, belong to his plant rather than to Jussieu's. But as in the present 
instance the latter botanist described his plant so satisfactorily, that it has always been recognised by succeeding au- 
thors, which Linnaeus was unable to do, on account of his want of materials, we have preferred retaining the name

original name Eresia must not, it seems, be admitted. 

Our figure was taken from fine specimens communicated to Mr. Lambert by Dr. Hamilton, who 

in St. Domingo. 

The other plants in the gardens about London, which are considered species of Theophrasta, probably belong to 



bllected them 



more genera than one ; at least not to Theophrasta. One which we observed

For the figure of this new species of Oncidium we are indebted to Dr. Hooker. It was received by him, with 
several other fine Orchideous plants, from William Swainson, Esq., who collected it during his residence in Brazil. 

In the latest enumeration of the species of this genus, which we believe is in Persoon's Synopsis, only five species 
are mentioned ; of which one is doubtful. But Swartz, from whom this account is copied, seems to have had no very 
distinct idea of the limits between Oncidium and Cymbidium, which were first satisfactorily pointed out by Mr. Brown, 

several plants referred by him to the latter genus decidedly belong to the former. Mr. Brown has already shown 



that the Cymbidium triquetrum of that botanist is a species of Oncidium ; as M. Kunth has with respect to h 



bidium pusillum 



We have ourselves 



tained, by means of the Banksian herbarium, that the same is the 



Cym 






with Cymbidium juncifolium, which, in fact, is very nearly related to Oncidium Cebolleta : and we presume from 
Plunder's figure, that there can be no reason to doubt that Cymbidium cuneatum is an Oncidium also. These addi- 
tions, and the new species published by Kunth, Sims and Meyer, with our O. barbatum, and another new species 

" ^ : or to 20 if the 



M 



from Mexico, sent to Mr. Lambert by Pavon, will make the number of species now amount to 19 
Ionopsis of Kunth be a species of Oncidium, as Dr. Meyer supposes 



In one portion of them the two anterior divisions of the flower cohere more or less intimately : sometimes formin & 



lum 



gle piece, but more usually cohering simply at their base ; always, however, more or less concealed by the label 
In the rest there is no union whatever of this kind ; but as the two groups differ in no other respect, they can 



only be considered sections of the same very natural genus ; which may be thus arranged

This very pretty and distinct species of Ornithogalum was sent to Mr. Cattley by Dr. Fischer ; and flowered in 

% â–  

\ 

his garden last February. 

Independently of its dwarf habit and ciliated leaves, which in native specimens are frequently covered all over to- 

c ' 

wards the base with little hairs, it differs from 0. umbellatum in having bracteae of the same length as the flowerstalks. 






The hairiness on the stem and peduncles, mentioned by Bieberstein, was certainly absent from our specimens ; nor 






v 






did we observe any upon the plant belonging to theHorticultural Society, from which the figure in Edwards's Bota- 
nical Register was taken. 

* 

If it is possible to judge from Tenore's figures of Orn. montanum and exscapum, there is no good reason for sup- 
posing them distinct from Ornithogalum umbellatum.

The plants from which our figure of this species of Triumfetta was taken, were raised by Mr. Lambert from seeds 
thirty years old, obtained from a specimen collected in Peru by M. Pavon. 

' \ â€¢ 

The racemes of flowers frequently become more elongated than we have represented them, and particularly so in 
West Indian specimens ; owing, no doubt, to the difference in temperature of different places. There is not much 

\ 

beauty in the plant, unless it is very profusely in flower ; when the contrast between the little yellow blossoms and 
very dark green leaves is agreeable enough. 

The discus is placed on the outside of the base of the stamens, and exhibits the appearance of a little membranous 
hairy cup. The hooks of the surface of the ovarium consist of two unequal joints ; the terminal one much smaller

We have already, under the article Goodyera pubescens, Tab. 25, endeavoured to explain why we prefer the name 
Spiranthes to that of Neottia ; and on what grounds we differ from the learned President of the Linnean Society 
in considering it distinct from Goodyera. And we think, if the details of the two genera as expressed upon our plates 
be compared, there can be no reasonable doubt of their being truly distinct 

This very pretty species of Spiranthes was imported by the Horticultural Society from Ch 
present year (1821) ; and flowered in their stove in July last 



the spring of the 



The form of its leaves, and the total absence of pu 



bescence from every part of its inflorescence, afford abundant marks of difference between it and Spiranthes autum- 
nalis, aestivalis, and tortilis, with which alone it can possibly be confounded. 

After the flower of this genus has been expanded for a short time, the glandular portion of the gynizus separates 
from the rest, and adheres firmly to the pollen masses ; thus giving the top of the gynizus, after a certain time, the 
appearance of being cleft.

The name of this fine genus has been communicated to us by Mr. Brown from his unpublished manuscripts. The 
various groups of plants constituting a Section in the Orchidea with waxy pollen, to which we have previously had 
occasion to allude under Angrcecum maculatum (since published as Geodorum pictum by Professor Link), as distin- 

â–  

have 



5 



shed by the appendages of the pollen masses, and certain other characters, from the genera with which they 



hitherto been arranged, offer so few differences of structure in their columna, that it is perhaps useless to attempt 
to seize characters for them from that organ. The other parts of the fructification, however, present a great diversity 



f for 



and appearance 



from which excellent characters may be derived. This is particularly 






the 



subject of this article; which, although possessing no striking peculiarities in its coli

Notwithstanding certain differences in the description of Satyrium giganteum, we strongly suspect it is the very 






same as our plant : at least we feel persuaded that it is a species of Lissochilus. Unfortunately there are no speci- 
mens of it in the herbaria in London ; nor did our friend Mr. Burchell ever meet with it during his residence at the 

Cape. 



The plant from which our figure was taken was imported by Mr. Griffin from the Cape of Good Hope some years 
since, and produced its flowers, for the first time, in the early part of the last summer. We think, without any excep- 
lion, it is the finest plant of the order we ever saw alive.

which may render such a measure justifiable. The materials already collected for the use of the work are considerable;

We received tbis very beautiful species of Cypripedium in November last from Mr. Cattley, to whom it had been 
transmitted in flower from the Botanic Garden, Liverpool, by Mr. Shepherd, the worthy curator of that institution. 

It is obviously a near relative of Cypripedium venuslum, and is said to be a native of the same country as that 
plant. It was sent by Dr. Wallich to England with the name we have assigned it, and probably has never flowered 

before in Europe. 

We remember formerly to have seen specimens, very similar to this, of a plant which had been brought from Java 

by Dr. Horsfield. Possibly it may prove a distinct species ; thus adding a third at least to the curious section of Cypri- 
pedium, of which the present subject forms a part ; a section which, as far as we have been able to discover, possesses no 
artificial character in the fructification by which it can be pronounced a distinct genus, but which nevertheless is so 
different from that which includes the species natives of more temperate latitudes, that we find ourselves almost com- 
pelled to question the universal application of the principle which excludes habit and foliage from the essential parts of 



& 



: distinctions. In the present instance we have three plants, probably all very different from each other as spec 
of the same quarter of the globe, with a considerable general similarity in appearance, necessarily, from the 
f certain technical differences assumed to be essential to the goodness of a genus, crowded among others vt 
he most careless observer would not only not be likely to confound them, but from which he would readily i 

ately distinguish them. We confess this is one of those difficulties we do not at present feel competent to sol

At the time we published our Digilalium Monographia, there were a few plants which had been noticed by 
European botanists, of which we had been unable to procure authentic specimens. Among these was a kind de- 
scribed by Roth, in his Catalccla Boianica, under the name of Digitalis media, which we referred, from the accu- 
rate description he has given of it, to the D. 

description between D. media and ambigua 



ambigua of Murray ; 



conceiving that the few differences in Roth's 



dental circumstances in cultivation mi

occasioned. Of this opinion we still remain ; notwithstanding the citation by Roth, of a representation in Lobel 
of a branch of what we cannot distinguish from Digitalis lutea in seed. Mr. Ferdinand Bauer, however havine 



&

Tlie drawing from wbicb we bave been permitted by the Council of the Horticultural Society to copy our repre- 
sentation of this fine plant, forms part of a magnificent illustration of the order Passiflorcce, of which Mr. Ferdinand 
Bauer has commenced the execution. It was found by himself in Norfolk Island, during the expedition under 
Captain Flinders, sent by the Government of this country to examine the coasts of New Holland. We feel Â«reat 
satisfaction in honouring it with the name of a botanist who is not less distinguished by his scientific acquirements, 
than by the consummate skill he possesses in the art of botanical drawing; of which the Flora Grceca of 
Dr. Sibthorp, the figures appended to the Atlas of Captain Flinders's Voyage, his own Illuslratipnes Flora Nova 
Hollandice, and our Digitalium Monographic afford the most abundant proofs. 

There are two species of Murucuja already published under the names of Passiflora adiantifolia and P. aurantia, 
which have considerable resemblance to this species ; and there are said to be several undescribed ones from the 
same quarter of the world with nearly similar features. From Murucuja adiantifolia i, its leaves without side lobes, 
its corona with numerous plicatures, the length of the radial divisions, &c. distinguish it. From Murucuja aurantia, 
it appears from specimens in the Banksian Herbarium, and from Forster's unpublished drawings in the same col- 
lection, to be distinguished by the shortness of the rays of that species, and the less degree of bluntness of its leaves: 
it also seems that the segments of the calyx are more winged towards their base. 

We have no hesitation in adopting the genus Murucuja of Toumefort and Jussieu ; and we are confirmed in our 
opinion of the propriety of doing so, by finding that our friend M. De Candolle intends to preserve it in his Mono- 
graph of the order which will appear in the next volume of his elaborate Regni vegetabilis Systema nalurale. We 
are ourselves disposed to think that Passiflora, as it at present stands, is susceptible of being divided into several 
genera, or, at least, that the structure of those curious modifications of petals which, under the form of rays, 
corona, operculum, &c. contribute the greater part of its beauty to the flower, will afford much better characters for 
division than those from the leaves, which have hitherto been generally adopted. Passiflora perfoliata is certainly a 
very strong genus, distinguished by its abbreviated ray and corona bent downwards, so as to line the sides of the 



Passifl 



of the tube of the calyx. In fact, it is more nearly related to Tacsonia than either to Murucuja

At the time we were first acquainted with this genus, the subject of the accompanying plate was the only species of 
which we had any information. It even then appeared to be essentially distinct from Broughtonia both in habit 
and artificial characters. When, at a subsequent period, the rare Brazilian plant which has been published at 

was submitted to examination, it obviously offered such striking generic resemblances to the 



tab. 33 of this work 



first, and at the same time so many beautiful specific differences, that we no longer hesitated to establish 
two 



upon 



the 



a new genus, which 



was called Cattlcya. Since that time a third species, from the same country, perfectly 
agreeing with the first two kinds in the characters assigned to the genus, but differing as much from them, as they 
from each other, and having yellow flowers, has been sent to the Horticultural Society from Rio Janeiro by the late 

â–  

Mr. Forbes, in compliment to whom we have named it 

Cattlcya (Forbesii) ; foliis oblongis obtusis planis, sepalis lanceolatis subaequalibus : interioribus angustioribus 

undulatis obtusis, labelli trilobi lobo medio cordato lunato argute dentato apice saccato, 
Had. Rio Janeiro in truncis arborum emortuorum epiphyta. 
A fourth species of Cattlcya (C. citrina, Nob.) is the Sobralia citrina of M. de la Llave. 

At the time the genus Cattlcya was under consideration, it became necessary to examine such other Orchidca as 
appeared to be related to it. The consequence of which was the establishment (from dried specimens) of the genus 
Cozlogyne, which a subsequent examination of living plants has confirmed in all material points. To that genus it 
was not at that time thought advisable to refer the Epidendrum precox and humile of Sir James Smith, because, 
from want of sufficiently perfect materials, we did not possess the necessary means of ascertaining the nature of those 
organs by a knowledge which our judgement would have been directed. Lately, however, a genus called Pleione has 
been proposed for the two species under consideration, and the number of their pollen masses has been stated to be two. 
But upon an examination of very perfect specimens of Epid. humile in our friend Dr. Hooker's herbarium, we find 
that the pollen masses are four cohering by pairs, and not two. Their columna is also distinctly winged, and the 
anther is inserted below the membranous end of the columna ; thus no points of difference whatever can be said to 
, exist between them and Cadogyne, which now consists of the following- published species, all natives of Asia : viz.

This plant is a native of the West Indies. Our drawing was made from an individual which flowered in a stove 
the Horticultural Society's garden at Chiswick, in May 1824. It had been sent to the Society by His Excellency

was known ; and fi 



the cha- 



ibuted to it fi 



of dried specimens, it appeared nearly related 



fact it was subsequently referred by Dr. Meyer. It proves however, upon a view of 



curious

Under Vanda multiflora it has been attempted to show the necessity of separating from the genus Vanda 



species hitherto referred to it, and 



V. leretifolia of this work. They differ ft 



Vanda in the form 



structure of their labellum,, which is never saccate, but has always a spur with one or more appendages in its m- 
, in the texture of their perianthium, and in habit. The plants which agree with Sarcanthus as above defined 
Vanda leretifolia and paniculata, an unpublished species (Sarcanthus succisus) from China, and probably some 
ts at present referred to Aeridcs. Vanda trichorhiza of Hooker (which is nearly allied to, if not the very same as, 



Epidcndnwi triste of Forster), and Aeridcs Arachnitis of Swartz, appear to be species of Cymb 



ffe 



rs 



ft 



Vanda in scarcely any thing beyond the absence of a spur from the lip, and 



ticulation of 



latter with the columna.
