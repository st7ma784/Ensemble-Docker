Tar. notes of which this volume contains a summary have been accumulated 
very gradually. I was born in the Riding about which I have undertaken 
to write, and have always looked to it as my home. From year to year I 
have visited the different parts of it, usually studying more or less atten- 
tively its natural features and productions, and latterly I have paid more 
systematic attention during my excursions to the subjects to which this 
book is devoted, endeavouring, as much as might be, when I have had 
suitable opportunites, to attend to those points which fall within their 
scope respecting which information was not already obtained and placed 
on record. 

What I have endeavoured to furnish has been such an account of North 
Yorkshire botany, geology, physical geography and climate, as might be 
consulted and read by those who are not practically acquainted with the 
Riding, and might render the work suitable to be used as a handbook and 
guide-book by residents and visitors. 

Information, both published and unpublished, respecting the various 
subjects treated upon, I have of course appropriated and received from 
all available sources. The monographs of Professor Phillips on the Geo- 
logy of Yorkshire have long since taken their place in the standard litera- 
ture of the science : and his more recent " Rivers, Mountains, and Sea- 
coast of Yorkshire" will be doubtless known to most of those in whose 
way this volume is likely to fall. And my obligations to Professor Phil- 
lips are not only in respect of these, but he has also most kindly looked 
over what I have written with regard to Geology. With each of the tables 
that relate to local climate the personal authority upon which the figures 
rest is stated. Of the books and collectors relied upon for details of bota-

numerous kind friends who in so many various ways have aided my under- 
taking I would tender here my best thanks : and at the same time would 
wish to assure both those to whom I am already indebted, and any others 
who may take an interest in the subject, that corrections or further infor- 
mation will be received gladly, and used if ever a second edition of the 
book should be required.

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.

INTRODUCTION. 

North Yorkshire, as the term is hero employed, comprises the North 
Riding of Yorkshire, properly so called, and also the Ainsty and City of 
York. For legal purposes the City of York is a County hy itself, and 
the Ainsty is now a wapentake of the "West Riding, but North Yorkshire 
as here understood is the parliamentary distriet which is designated by 
that name. It is bounded on the north by Durham, on the west by 
Westmoreland, on the south by the "West and East Ridings of Yorkshire 
and on the east by the German Ocean. It includes a surface of irregular- 
ly rhomboidal contour, 2112 square miles in area, which measures at the 
utmost 88 miles from cast to west, and 53 from north to south. Only 
three of the EngHsh counties are larger than it is ; and these arc Devon- 
shire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk. Physically it may be roughly described 
as a broad central valley running north and south between two ranges of 
hills. The western mass attains an elevation of about 2600 feet above the 
stsa-level, and the range which is situated on the east of the central vaUey 
reaches nearly 1 500 feet, the general slope of the surface being from north 
west to south east. The Riding embraces within its limits a very wido 
diversity of natural features ; a coast line where long ranges of cliff suc- 
ceed undulate d banks of shifting sand and low flat tracts of marsh : a rich 
and weU cultivated interior mapped out into fields of corn and grass, 
separated from one another by thick shadowy hedgerows and diversified

by woods and river* ; and above the valley on either side rise extensive 
tracts of moorland country, bleak and heathery throughout its higher 
levels, intersected by pleasant dales and clear sparkling streams, its sum- 
mits girdled with long lines of rugged and precipitous scar. Its industry 
of the productive kind is mainly of an agricultural Btamp, that which does 
not ally itself to farming in some of its branches being principally employ- 
ed in connection with the iron trade and with shipping, and there are no 
manufactures or coal mines of any considerable extent within its limits. 
York, with its castle and cathedral and old historic memories, is its only 
city, and has within its parliamentary limits a population of 45,000. 
Then come the maritime towns : â€” Middlesborough, a port for the Durham 
coal-field, and the nucleus of the Cleveland iron district, which has risen 
during the present century from a solitary farm-house to a town of up- 
wards of 80,000 inhabitants ; and next in order Scarborough and Whitby, 
the two latter principally known as fashionable sea-side resorts in summer 
time, with 18,000 and 12,000 inhabitants respectively. Next follow the 
four agricultural boroughs, Malton, Thirsk, Richmond and Northallerton, 
with populations ranging from eight thousand to under five, and the 
borough in each case, including adjacent villages in addition to the actual 
town. And besides these there are fourteen agricultural market towns, 
with populations ranging from upwards of 2500 to under 700, which in 
order of population are as follows, viz : â€” Pickering, Easingwold, Guis- 
borough, Stokesley, Kirby-moorside, Hawes, Yarra, Helmsley, Reeth, 
Bcdale, Masham, Middleham, Leyburn, and Askrigg. The average popu- 
lation of the whole of North Yorkshire at the last census was 135 to a 
square mile. 

The past history of the inhabitants of the district, of their rulers and 
other notabilities, of their wars and progress in the various arts of civili- 
zation, its castles, abbeys, camps and other antiquarian remains have been 
treated very thoroughly in various well known works. Here it is propo- 
sed not to enter into these subjects at all, but to confine the attention to the 
physical features which the field of study itself presents ; in the first place 
to consider the circumstances and details of the internal structure, physi- 
cal geography and climate of its various districts; and afterwards to 
enumerate the plants of the higher orders which it produces and treat 
respecting the distribution of these over the various parts of its surface, 
at the same time endeavouring to trace out in what way the facts con- 
nected with the distribution of the plants connect themselves with and 
serve to indicate conditions of climate and geological constitution.

CHAPTER I. 

GEOLOGY. 

â™¦With the exception of a small tract of Basalt in Upper Teesdale, and 
a narrow dike or terrace of the same nature which extends from the lower 
part of the same valley of Tees to penetrate the Cleveland moors, all the 
subjacent rocks of North Yorkshire are of the kind which owe their origin 
to the gradual deposit of sediment from water. Except in the shape of 
loose fragments in the glacial diluvium we have not either* Slate, Granite, 
or Chalk : and although Tertiary deposits are met with just beyond our 
boundary, except the glacial diluvium all the sedimentary deposits which 
occur within the limits of our field of study belong either to the Pri- 
mary or Secondary periods. In order of deposition they range either 
from west to east, or from north-west to south-east, so that a person 
travelling in a direct line from the Derwent valley, opposite Filey, 
to the summit of Cronkley fell in Teesdale, would pass over each of 
the series of strata in succession and each change would be from rocks of 
a more recent to those of an earlier date of deposition, or if he were travel- 
ling in an opposite direction each change would bo from rocks of an earlier 
to those of a later date. The following table will shew their order and 
geological classification.

The Carboniferous System. A line drawn from Pierse bridge on the 
Tees, to Tanfield on the Yore, bounds on the east that part of North 
Yorkshire which is underlaid by the Primary rocks. The Carboniferous 
system taken as a whole makes up the entirety of the western mass of 
moorlands. Its oldest, or Mountain Limestone series of strata may be 
conveniently treated under two divisions, a lower and an upper set of beds 
and it is in the midst of the former that the Teesdale basalt is intruded 
and has its place. 

The Lower Mountain Limestone or Scar Limestone series. This lower 
limestone is more or less exposed to view in the depths of each of the three 
principal dales of the western moorlands, Teesdale, Swaledale, and Yore- 
dale. A long line of strongly marked dislocation passes northward from 
the Ingleborough district to the mountains round the source of the South 
Tyne, an idea of the tremendous character of which may be gathered from, 
the fact that for a length of forty -five miles the strata are displaced to the 



of hills between Thirsk and 
Scarbro'.

extent of at least three thousand feet. An observer stationed upon the 
elevated edge on the east of this line (as for instance, upon the summit of 
Wild Boar fell, or Swarth fell, which are situated in Westmoreland, just 
opposite the head of Yoredale) stands upon millstone grit strata, with a 
thick mass of mountain limestone beneath them, and sees outstretched 
2000 feet below him the valley of the Eden and the plain of Carlisle, 
where these same mountain limestone and millstone grit beds are buried 
beneath superincumbent deposits of New Red Sandstone. From this 
main line of dislocation, which is known by the name of the Pen- 
nine fault, two cross lines strike out at right angles towards the east 
The northern one of these is about fifty miles in length, and is continued 
from Brampton in Cumberland to the Northumbrian coast near Cullercoats, 
relatively depressing the strata on the north and elevating those on tho 
south of it to an extent which cannot be estimated at less than two thou- 
sand feet. The southern lino, or rather a double southern line, reaches 
about thirty miles and may be distinctly traced as far eastward as Wharf- 
dale, in the same way relatively depressing the strata on the south and 
elevating those on the north of it from one to three thousand feet. 

It is along the line of the Pennine fault, and in the Craven country 
about Settle that this lower mountain limestone is seen to tho best advan- 
tage. Here it forms a compact calcareous mass about 400 feet in thickness, 
with very little or hardly any interpolation of non-calcareous material, 
with numerous vertical fissures, and in some places, as for instance on the 
south-eastern slope of Ingleborough, it may be seen with its lower beds 
full of broken slate boulders resting upon masses of dark coloured Silurian 
slate. The steep precipices which girdle LangstrothdaU, Littondale, 
Gordale, Ribblesdale, Ingletondale, and Kingsdale, and the thick mass of 
caverned and fissured limestone that forms the general base of the well 
known Craven hills, Fountains fell, Ingleborough, Pennyghent and 
Whernside must all be referred here. Along the western border of the 
county it forms the lower part of the great Pennine escarpment, still shew- 
ing fine limestone scars as far north as the country round the head of the 
Tees. But as it passes towards the north, both along the edge of this line 
and in the interior of the moorland mass, it loses the distinctly marked 
calcareous stamp which characterises it in Craven, and the farther it goes 
in that direction, argillaceous and arenaceous bands are more and more 
mixed up with the limestone. In Pennyghent and Ingleborough its upper 
surface is 1300 feet and beneath Great Whernside it is 1400 feet above 
the sea-level. At the head of the Ribble it has sunk to 1000 feet, and

between this point and the south side of Yoredale opposite Hawes it de- 
clines 150 feet more. Altogether in Yoredale about 240 feet of its upper 
portion is exposed. It fills up the lower part of the valley from the 
Hawes neighbourhood as far east as Redmirc, a distance of twelve miles. 
Its limestones form the long low terrace that borders the road between 
Askrigg and Carperby, the falls about the village of Gale, the picturesque 
rapids of Aysgarth and may also be seen exposed round the sides of Sea- 
mer Water. Here the interpolations in the limestone are principally ar- 
gillaceous and may be best seen about Askrigg and above Aysgarth Bridge, 
and bear altogether to the limestone a proportion of about two to three. 
From Great Whernside to Aysgarth it declines 700 feet in eight miles. 
On the north side of Yoredale opposite Hawes we have the upper surface 
of this lower limestone at about 800 feet above the sea level, and in 
Swaledale about the same height a small portion of the upper part is ex- 
posed to view in the neighbourhood of Muker. From this point north- 
ward it is not anywhere to be seen till we reach Upper Teesdale. In the 
Micklefell tract the upper beds may be seen immediately above the 
Basalt. Here the upper band of limestone is from 25 to 50 feet in thick- 
ness, and is known by the name of Tyne bottom limestone. In Cronkley 
fell it reaches an elevation of 1750 feet, but from this point it is much de- 
pressed by dislocations both towards the north and east, and southeast of 
the great fault which ranges along Lunedalo it is lost altogether. By 
proximity with or contiguity to the Basalt the various strata become 
much changed in character, the shales prismatised, both the sandstones 
aud shales bleached and rendered brittle and the normally compact 
calcareous beds which immediately overlie the basalt are metamorphosed, 
as in Cronkley fell, into a loosely granular 11 sugar limestone." A few 
miles further north the rich mining tract of Alston Moor furnishes the

The 'Teesdah Basalt <yr Whin sill. A huge mass of rock which has 
owed its origin to igneous agency, and which is known locally by the 
name of the *Whin Sill, extends from the neighbourhood of Brough in 
Westmoreland into the district round the head waters of the Tees, "Wear 
and Tyne, and from thence, with some interruptions, is continued as far 
north as the Northumbrian coast near Alnwick. It attains its greatest 
developcment at the Caldron Snout, where it is from 200 to 300 feet in 
thickness, being in Tynedale about 120 feet thick, and at the head of 
Hilton Beck, which is only six miles westward from the Caldron Snout, 
becoming diminished to 24 feet. Generally the deposit is remarkably 
layer-like in character, conformed to the plane of the stratification of the 
neighbouring sedimentary rocks, and in Teesdale and Tynedale it would 
seem to be nearly or quite uniform in its geological position, which is 
always below, but not far below, the Tyne bottom limestone which forms 
the uppermost band of the series of beds which has just been noticed. 
Generally it is fine in grain and dark in colour, and forms rudely prisma- 
tic vertical columns. At the Caldron Snout, where the foaming waters of 
the Tees leap down a basaltic ravine two hundred feet in depth, this co- 
lumnar structure may be seen to the best advantage, and it may be observed 
upon a smaller scale in the falls of Blea beck. Spreading from the Caldron 
as a centre, in our district the Basalt ranges up Maze beck for two miles, 
attains a considerable elevation above the river in Cronkley Scars and may 
still be seen in the river-bed as far down as the High force and Winch 
bridge. At the High force the top of the waterfall is Basalt and the 
lower beds indurated and subprismatic shale, with beds of limestone below. 

â€¢ Wbinstone is the local name for basaltic rock, the Scottish quhyn-stane. Sill is the Saxon syll, 
syle, the French seall, the flat piece of timber or stone at the foot of a door or the bottom of a window.

Leaving the Tees lower down it ranges along the south side of the dale 
past Holwiek and Unthank, and at last is lost about a quarter of a mile 
from the Tees half a mile from its junction with the Lune. The whole 
district is full of the marks of eruptive force and the influence of great 
dislocations. Its four principal faults will be noticed more particularly 
when we come to speak of the Upper Mountain Limestone. From the 
upper part of Lunedale two basaltic dikes pass near the end of the great 
basaltic mass and are prolonged in a north-eastern direction to the Durham 
coal-field. The uniformity of the geological position of the Whin sill, 
taken in connection with the stratiform character of its great mass and its 
general conformity to the plane of the stratification of the neighbouring 
sedimentary beds, would seem to point to its having been poured out 
amongst them during the time of their deposition, but even if this be the 
case with regard to the Teesdalo Whin-sill, there can be no doubt that 
in the tract of country of which we have been speaking, overflowings and 
outbursts of submarine lava have occured at different epochs. 

The Upper Mountain Limestone or Yoredale series. The most character- 
istic section of the upper mountain limestone series of strata is to be met 
with in the upper part of Yoredale, (or as it is more commonly called 
locally, Wensleydale,) in the neighbourhood of llawes. In the fells upon 
both sides of the dale it reaches a thickness of nearly one thousand feet, 
and is made up of not less than five distinct bands of limestone, with 
intermediate beds of non-calcareous constitution as follows, viz : â€”

hood of Huwc8 thu Main Limestone may be seen at a height above the sea 
of about 1800 feet. As we proceed from Hawes southward in the direc- 
tion of Craven, we have, as before stated, the plane of the stratification 
of the lower mountain limestone series sloping upwards and at the head 
of the Ribble 150 feet higher than at Hawes. In this direction the space 
between the Main and Underset bands of limestone grows thinner, till at 
last they are united together into one mass on the south side of Cam fell. 
As the series is shown on the north side of the great Craven fault, a still 
further contraction of the non-calcareous interpolations as compared with 
the Hawes section is seen. In Pennyghent the upper surface of this 
Yoredale scries is 1900 feet above the sea-level and its beds as under, viz.

In Inglcborough the section is similar to this last, but the upper limestone 
is about 200 feet higher than in Pennyghent and considerably thinner. 
It forms a scar about 30 feet in thickness, which may be seen to advan- 
tage on the crest of the Ingleton or western slope of the mountain. 

From Hawes proceeding towards the east down the Yoredale valley wo 
have on the south side of it the Underset limestone at an elevation of 1565 
feet forming the summit of Addleborough, and along the line of drainage 
which forms the southern boundary of the Riding, the Main limestone 
maintaining an elevation of about 1900 feet from Widdale fell along Cam 
fell as far cast as the head of Bishopdale. But between this point and the 
Wharfdale slope of Great Whernside, where the lower limestone is 1400 
feet high, the Yoredale series has declined in level upwards of 200 feet 
by the upper limestones having become completely obliterated and the 
non-calcarcous interpolations between the lower beds having also vanish- 
ed almost entirely, as the following section shews.

This is the section of the y oredale series on the Wharfdale side of Great 
Whernside, but on the Coverdale side of the mountain and at the summit 
of drainage between Coverdale and Wharfdale the upper limestones may 
be seen making their appearance and rapidly attaining a considerable 
thickness, so that on the west side of Coverdale the Main limestone is 
from 30 to 40 feet thick, and these, with the non-calcareous bands which 
are interpolated between the lower beds, in the space between the Wharf- 
dale side of Great Whernside, and Starbottom, a distance of only three 
miles, swell the series from 277 to 510 feet. Along the whole length of 
Coverdale, a distance of 15 miles, the non-calcareous beds above the 
middle limestone, which in the Hawes district attain a thickness of 430 
feet are only augmented to 150 feet, whilst towards the east they are 
diminished to 30 feet and towards the south and south-cast vanish alto- 
gether; and in like manner the non-calcareous beds below the middle 
limestone, which at Hawes are 350 feet in thickness, in Coverdale are 
reduced to 150 feet and towards the lower part of Wharfdale, in a south- 
eastern direction, cease altogether ; a state of things plainly pointing to 
the conclusion that in this district at this particular epoch the deep sea 
was towards the south-cast and its shores towards the west and southwest. 

At the west end of Penhill we have the Yoredale series from 600 to 
700 feet in thickness, with all the principal beds of the Hawes section 
present, but the grits and plates above the Middle limestone much reduced 
in thickness. On the Coverdale side of Penhill the Main limestone has 
sunk to 1 1 00 feet above the sea-level, and the Hardraw limestone ranges 
from the end of Bishopdale past West Wit ton and dips beneath the sur- 
face in the bed of the Yore near Bolton Hall. By the time we reach. 
Middleham moor the Main limestone has declined to 850 feet, and at East 
Witton to 400 feet above the sea-level. Here it is extensively quarried 
and is about 20 feet thick. It may be traced along the whole length of 
both sides of Coverdale, in the lower part of the dale forming a terrace, on 
the surface of which the high road is carried in some places ; and as we 
proceed from these points further east the series is altogether buried be- 
neath the Millstone Grit. 

On the north side of the Yoredale valley, the Hardraw limestone may 
be best seen at the waterfalls called Hardraw force and Millgill force, the 
Upper limestone best at Leyburn Shawl, and between ABkrigg and Carpcr- 
by, and most of the lower members of the series may be examined at the 
lead mines at Ellerbank near Carperby and at the Keld heads near Preston- 
under-Bcar. At the former locality the Main limestone forms a double

From an elevation of 1700 feet in Cotterfell and the south side of Lovely 
Seat, the Main limestone declines gradually eastward to 1025 feet at 
Preston, 836 feet at Leyburn Shawl, and 700 feet at the town of Leyburn. 
Through the mass of moor between Yoredale and Swaledale, the course of 
the series is nearly level or declining slightly towards the north. On the 
south side of Lovely Seat the Main limestone is upwards of 200 feet lower 
than in Cam fell and Bear's Head, and on the north or Swaledale side of 
the same hill it is 1554 feet in elevation, with 660 feet of the Millstone 
Grit beds over it. Between this point and Mukcr the Yoredale series is 
exposed in Cliff gill, with a total thickness of nearly 700 feet, with all the 
limestones of the Hawes section present, the upper band 82 feet, and tho 
underset band with chert on the top of it, 54 feet in thickness, but tho 
lower limestones thinner than at Hawes ; and the non-calcareous interpo- 
lations above the Middle limestone 237 feet thick, instead of 430 and those 
below it 210 feet instead of 350. The head of the pass between the dales 
of the Swale and the Eden is 1700 feet in elevation, and the mountain 
peaks that encircle it arc about 600 feet higher, and here also the Main 
limestone is between 1500 and 1600 feet in elevation. East of Lovely 
Seat it attains 1600 feet in Satron Hangers, and from thence sinks east- 
ward to 800 feet in Downholme moor. 

A few miles from the head of Swaledale the valley divides into two, and 
the two branches rejoin each other at Muker. A fine ridge of hill which

bears the name of Keasdon is thus insulated, and here the Yoredale scries 
may be well seen, the Main limestone forming the summit of the mass at 
its southern extremity, but having a cap of Millstone (frit over tt at 
the north end of the ridge, which reaches an elevation of 1 643 feet. The 
tract between the Swale and the Greta is a rich and long worked lead- 
mining country, with many dislocations. In Nine Standards the Main 
limestone attains about 1700 feet. Ascending "Water Crag by way of 
Stonesdale, we have the Underset limestone at an elevation of 800 feet 
above Muker and 1150 feet above the sea-level; above it about 60 feet of 
non-calcareous interpolation, 80 feet of Main limestone and between this 
and the hill summit in this direction nearly 900 feet of the bed9 of the 
Millstone Grit series ; but on the eastern or Arkendale side of the same 
hill the Main limestone is nearly 100 feet higher, its upper surface in 
Punchard's Gill being 1360 feet in elevation, with the base of the under- 
set limestone 190 feet below it, and 230 feet more of the lower beds before 
we reach the bed of the stream. Towards the south-east the Main lime- 
stone reaches 1600 feet in the angle between Arkendale and Swaledale 
above Reeth. Along the line of the former dale, which runs from the 
north-west towards the south-east, a fault depresses the beds in a north- 
eastern direction, and in Fremington edge we have the Main limestone at 
1150 feet and tho Middle limestone at 200 feet above the river. From 
this point through the moorlands eastward to the Castle-hill at Richmond, 
a distance of eight miles, the Main limestone sinks gradually to 450 feet. 

In the dale of the Greta we have only the upper half of the series 
visible. The Middle limestone may be seen in the deeply excavated river 
bed near Rutherford Bridge and the flagstones above it are quarried 
extensively about Brignal and Scargill. The junction of the Tees and 
Greta is in the Main limestone at an elevation of 380 feet, and the same 
rock, with its beds dipping steeply towards the north, forms the *bed of 
the Tees beneath the well known Abbey bridge of Eglestone, and the 
equally well known scars that margin tho Greta in Rokeby Park. From 
this point the Main limestone may be traced along the edge of the fella

which border the dale of the Greta to an elevation of nearly 1000 feet at 
Bowes, and from thence along the south side of the dale by way of Gil- 
manscar, past the summit of drainage between Arkendale and Swaledale 
to Gilling, and from thence back again to Rokeby, beneath Gatherley 
moor by way of lorsett and Hutton Magna : and a small isolated tract of 
limestone is also to be seen on the east of the gritstone at Middleton Tyas. - 

Between Gretadale and Lunedale there is a synclinal fold or trough in 
the Mountain limestone, dipping from the south and north towards Deep- 
dale and Balderdale, so deeply that in this tract of country the Yoredale 
series is altogether buried beneath superincumbent masses of Millstone 
Grit. Along the line of Lunedale a fault runs which elevates the strata 
on the north of it to the extent of about 1000 feet. Another fault passes 
from the Caldron 8nout along the line of Maze btck between Micklefell 
and Birkdale, elevating the strata on the south-east, and a third along 
the line of the main dale of the Tees throwing up the beds towards the 
south, which in the neighbourhood of Middleton causes a difference of 
some hundreds of feet between the elevation of the beds on the opposite 
sides of the dale. So' that the triangular tract of country enclosed between 
the Tees, the Lune and Maze beck consists of a pyramid of beds of the 
Yoredale series elevated upon a floor of Basalt and Lower Mountain 
limestone lifted considerably higher than the corresponding strata in the 
country which immediately surrounds it. The Main limestone forms the 
general plateau of the culminating Micklefell ridge, and there is a cap of 
sixty feet of gritstone over it at the western or highest end of the ridge, 
which is the highest point in Yorkshire, and which reaches an elevation 
of nearly 2600 feet. The height reached by the Mountain Limestone in 
the Teesdale district is its maximum elevation in Britain. Here the Main 
limestone is 70 feet thick and the Underset limestone 24 feet thick, with 
a space of about 80 feet between them. Complicated dislocations, es- 
pecially the three faults to which reference has just been made, and a 
fourth which is called the Burtreo ford dike, and which ranges from * 
Langdon Beck across the east end of Falcon Clints and Cronkley Scars 
towards the head of Lunedale, causing a downthrow on the east to the 
extent of about 200 feet, produce great confusion in the stratification of 
the lower beds of the series. These vary considerably in thickness in 
different places, the greatest thickness anywhere attained by a lower lime- 
stone being 40 feet and the space between the underset limestone and the 
Tyne bottom limestone ranging from about 300 to 600 feet. Between the 
Main limestone of Micklefell and the Tyne bottom limestone of the White

force, there is a difference in level of 850 feet, but here the Burtree ford 
dike intervenes. In Alston moor the Yoredale series is 495 feet thick, 
350 feet of which is made up by non-calcareous beds, the principal of 
which are two bands of hard gritstone called respectively the Brigstone 
hazle and the Nattriss gill hazle. 

The Milhtom Grit series. For a typical Bection of this series as we 
have it in North Yorkshire we must go either to Colsterdale on the east of 
Great Whernside, or to where the beds of this series fill up the great 
synclinal depression between Swaledale and Lunedale, the existence of 
which has been indicated when speaking of the subjacent strata; or better 
still, to the hills which surround the lower part of Wharfdale and Nidder- 
dale, where we shall find it thicker and better developed than it is any- 
where within our own proper limits. The various members of the series 
are very different in different localities, so that it is often a task of great 
difficulty to decide respecting the identity of the beds, and their proper 
relation to one another. In the Ilkley and Pateley bridge tract the series 
attains in some places a thickness of fully one thousand feet, with strata 
as under, viz ; â€”

and the lower grit ranges down both sides of Coverdale, with the middle 
grit over it in isolated patches to form the highest summits. From the 
edge of Coverdale proceeding eastward towards the central valley the 
mass of moorland slopes with considerable abruptness, and within a short 
distance of Masham some of the beds higher than the Middle grit make 
their appearance, and nearer Tanfield a gritstone is to be seen which most 
likely represents the Upper or Brimham gritstone. In Penhill the series

In Buckden pike, where the surface of the Main limestone is 1850 feet 
above the sea-level, the Millstone grit series is only 450 feet in thickness, 
the summit rock being rather higher in the scale than that of Penhill. 
But as we proceed westward amongst the remainder of the hills on the 
south side of Yoredale we get only a 6mall thickness of the beds of this 
series, and that is only shewn in the shape of ridges or isolated patches 
upon a great Mountain Limestone floor ; as may best be seen in two of the 
hills in tho immediate neighbourhood of Hawes, Dod fell and Bear's Head. 

Between Yoredale and Swaledale the series is thickest towards the 
western and eastern extremities of the moorland mass, the Main Limestone

being left at or near the surface in the central portion of the range. In 
the five high summits on the edge of Mallcrstang there are from 700 to 
800 feet of Millstone Grit beds above the Main Limestone ; on the south 
side of Lovely Scat 535 feet and on the north side 662 feet : and at Ley- 
burn a coal seam upwards of a foot thick is obtained on the moor top 
about 120 feet above the Main limestone, which has a thick gritstone over 
it on the east, and in the neighbourhood of Downholme and Hudswell the 
same coal seam is also worked. 

Next we pass to the tract of the great synclinal depression, and by com- 
bining two of the Arkendale mining sections, and taking for each bed its 
greatest thickness in either of the two we obtain the following result, viz.

Here the top Millstone grit would appear to represent the middle grit of 
Nidderdalc and the summit grit of Penhill and the Colsterdale watershed, 
and the white grit the lower gritstone of Nidderdale and Ingleborough, 
the rest of the beds being grouped and numbered in correspondence with 
the Nidderdale section. 

On the Stonesdale side of Water Crag the series is upwards of 900 feet 
thick, and here we have above the Main Limestone 122 feet of the lower 
cherty group, 80 feet of the white grit, 1 1 0 of the upper cherty group, 
and 600 feet more of plates, middle grits and the upper plates and grits of 
Nidderdale before we reach the summit. In Nine Standards the Main 
Limestone is considerably higher than in Water Crag, and the gritstone 
thinner. At this point it is about 400 feet in thickness, and from thence 
along the summit of the escarpment over Mallerstang as far north as 
Stainmoor, the upper beds are still those which overlie the upper Arken- 
dale grit. At the western edge of the county the road at the bottom of

the summits of the west and the peak of Goldsborough attain the middle 
gritstone ; and the general floor of the lower moorlands in the Lartington 
and Cotherstone tract is made up of the argillaceous heds below it. And 
north of the Lunedale fault the series is only seen in two caps over the 
Main Limestone of the Micklefell ridge, one at ita eastern, and the other, 
which is 60 feet in thickness and forms the highest part of the hill, at ita 
western extremity. 

The Permian system. The Magnesian Limestone series. Within the 
limits of our field of study along the whole length of the line of the edge 
of the Millstone grit *beds none of the strata of the Coal measures are to 
be seen, although they make their appearance both in a northern and 
southern direction soon after North Yorkshire is left behind, and both 
South Durham and West Yorkshire yield rich and extensively worked 
coal fields. It would, from various considerations, seem probable that 
these two coal fields, though now separated by a distance of sixty miles, 
have been originally connected together and that they have formed parts 
of one and the same mass. Both of them are formed in a basin of Mill- 
â€¢ stone grit and both are covered unconformably by the beds of the Mag- 
nesian limestone. Coals of like quality are worked in both of them in 
the same parts of the series and in both of them courses of Ironstone are 
plentiful in the lower and central portions of the formation. The long 
and varied range of deposits which we have already passed under review 
has evidently been laid down very gradually, and their deposition must 
have extended over a very lengthened period of time. But the era which 
immediately followed the end of that during which the beds of the great 
Carboniferous system were laid down has on the contrary been marked by 
a general eruption of disturbing forces, of the energy of which we may 
form some kind of an idea by studying the traces which they have left 
behind them in the tract of country with which we are here more partic- 
ularly concerned. At Cullercoats the Tynedale fault dislocates a mass of 
Magnesian Limestone strata, but although such is the case we may confi- 
dently infer from the fact of the nonconformity of the plane of the 
stratification of the great mass of the Magnesian limestone deposits in 
Durham and throughout Yorkshire to that of the subjacent Millstone grit 
and Coal Measures, that it is to the earlier part of the Permian epoch that 
we must look as the period of the Craven and great Pennine dislocations, 
especially as the condition of the beds in the valley of the Eden altogether 
confirms this view of the case. So that we have the upheaval of the 
whole mass of our western moorlands in the manner which has already

been described and the entire sweeping away of whatever portion of the 
beds of the Coal Measure series may have been deposited on the east of 
them to appeal to as a criterion of the extraordinary power and activity of 
the forces which came into operation at the era at which we have now 
arrived. 

It is this upheaval and denudation rather than the deposition of strata 
which constitute the groundwork from which we have to evolve the history 
of the Permian epoch so far as North Yorkshire is concerned. From the 
Midland Counties northward a terrace of Permian beds margins the Car- 
boniferous deposits along the line of their eastern- boundary. Through 
West Yorkshire this terrace is continuous and each of the rivers, in its 
course from west to east, breaks through it. In the south of the county 
it is usually several miles in breadth and in one place it attains 450 feet 
in elevation above the sea-level. At the south-west corner of the Ainsty 
the Magnesian limestone margins the Wharfe with cliffs at Thorp Arch 
and Newton Kyme. Passing northward by way of Enaresborough and 
Ripon it crosses the Yore half a mile below Tanneld Bridge. 

North of the Yore the terrace is much narrower than in the neighbour- 
hoods of Doncaster and Tadcaster. It soon rises to an elevation of 300 feet, 
with a conspicuous slope in an eastern direction. It ranges nearly in a 
straight line past Well and Nosterfield to a hill about two thirds of a mile 
west of Thornton Watlas and there the escarpment suddenly terminates. 
From Watlas to Little Crakehall there is no trace of Magnesian Lime- 
stone ; it is either entirely swept away or else buried beneath the thick 
beds of diluvial gravel which overspread this tract. It is laid bare again 
in the bed of the rivulet at Little Crakehall, and again makes its appear- 
ance beneath a mound of diluvial gravel five miles further north by the 
side of the private road from Bedale to Catterick about half a mile from 
the latter locality ; and is probably continued beneath the ridge which 
extends in the direction of Tunstall. It occurs also under thirty feet of 
diluvial gravel on the right bank of .the Swale about half a mile below 
Catterick Bridge. In the flat country north of the Swale and along the 
edge of the hills of Mountain limestone at Middleton Tyas there are no 
traces of it, but it reappears in a hill about half way between Newton 
Morrel and Cleasby, and is again seen at Rennison quarry, near Eppleby 
and by the Tees' side west of Pierse Bridge it forms a cliff beneath 30 feet 
of diluvium. North of the Tees it forms a cliff at Coniscliffe, and from 
this point northward through the county of Durham the terrace becomes 
much increased in width. In the south of Durham it fills up the whole

of the space from Hartlepool westward to the North Eastern line of rail- 
way. It borders the Durham coal-field on the south east and becomes 
gradually narrowed as we proceed northward. About Sunderland and 
Marsden there are excellent sections in the coast cliffs and it finally ceases 
upon the coast a short distance to the north of Tyne. 

Taking the series as a whole as represented in the North of England, 
its divisions are given by Professor Sedgwick as follows, beginning from 
above, viz. â€” 

1. Red and white marls. 

2. Thin bedded compact limestone, scarcely magnesian. 

3. Red and white marls and gypsum. 

4. Magnesian limestone in thick beds, in colour generally 

whitish or yellowish. 

5. Marl slate in thin layers. 

6. Yellow or purple sands, sandstones and marls. 

The lowest bed is the Pontcfract sandstone of Smith. Between the 
Wharfe and the Nidd it forms an advanced terrace ranging considerably to 
the west of the real Magnesian limestone. Here it is a coarse-grained, 
irregularly bedded purple sandstone, sometimes nearly approaching the 
appearance of a conglomerate, and decomposing into irregular masses, as 
may be well seen at Plumpton Rocks near Knaresborough. But in North 
Yorkshire this bed is nowhere to be seen distinctly, though numerous loose 
blocks which apparently belong to it occur in the diluvial detritus. 

The fifth and the third beds also are not anywhere distinctly known 
in North Yorkshire. The fourth bed or true magnesian limestone forms 
a cliff 70 feet in thickness at Knaresborough and cliffs from 30 to 50 feet 
thick on the banks of the Wharfe and Tees. The upper part of these is a 
firm cellular concretionary magnesian limestone and the lower part is more 
soft and earthy in texture. 

The second bed or upper slaty limestone is seen at Thorp Arch, and is 
represented at Well and Nosterfield by a system of smoke grey and dark 
bluish grey beds of limestone shattered so much as to resemble a highly 
indurated calcareous shale. The following is the section of Seven-acre 
quarry near Well from the main magnesian limestone bed upwards : â€”

1 . Strong yellow magnesian limestone forming the base 

of the quarry

Total 22 feet. 



At Welsea quarry near Well this upper system Of beds is 30 feet in 
thickness. The lime burnt from it may be spread over the land at the 
rate of six chaldrons to an acre, whilst of the true mngnesian limestone 
two chaldrons to an acre are about as much as the soil can usually bear 
with advantage. In Ripon park are beds of gypsum which probably 
belong to the rod and white marls which are placed above as the top 
stratum of the series. 

The Triassic or Sali/erous system. The New Bed Sandstone series. 
From the line drawn from Pierse Bridge on the Tees, through Catterick 
Bridge on the Swale to Tanfield on the Yore, and Thorp Arch on the 
Wharfe which forms the boundary on the east of all the Paheozoic deposits 
of North Yorkshire beneath a tract of comparatively level country which 
measures in breadth twelve miles at the narrowest part, and comprises 
altogether an area of 500 square miles, stretch the deposits of the New Red 
Sandstone series. This is, in fact, the northern portion of that long line 
of valley which is continued through the southern part of Yorkshire and 
which extends as far south as the neighbourhood of Nottingham and there 
expands into the great New Red Sandstone plain of the Midland Counties. 

In North Yorkshire these Triassic deposits are so thickly overlaid with 
diluvial sediment that it is only in a very few places that they are exposed 
to view, and we can only form a somewhat vague idea of their character 
and thickness. In the salt producing district of Cheshire, the series is 
1 700 feet thick, and in the valley of Severn it is about 300 feet less. 
The lower part of it consists principally of thick sandstones, which are 
usually coarse in grain and by the agency of per-oxidc of iron deeply 
tinged with red. In Nottmghamshire this portion of the formation has 
an average breadth of from eight to ten miles, the soil which rests upon it 
being chiefly composed of light yellowish sand, but all deep sections of 
undisturbed beds are red. In Cheshire this part of the series has a total 
thickness of 1000 feet, the beds being conglomeritic below and more lami-

nated and more interpolated with clays as we proceed upward. In our 
own field of study these sandstone beds may be seen in quarries at Kipon 
and Boroughbridge, and in the bed of the Tees about Croft. In two or 
three places in the vicinity of the Tees they have been partially sunk 
through in fruitless attempts at boring for coal. At Dinsdale they were 
excavated to a depth of 450 feet, and opposite Sockburn to a depth of 700 
feet without the Magnesian Limestone being reached. Here the strata 
were found* to consist of white, grey or reddish sandstones, with occasion- 
al partings of a more compact nature, red or blue shale, carbonaceous 
matter in thick layers and gypsum in nodules or beds. In one case a bed 
of gypsum was found which was three feet in thickness. In sinking for 
the foundations of the bridge over the Swale, of the Leeds Northern rail- 
way, solid sandstone was reached on the west of the river but not on the 
east. The upper part of the series consists principally of red marlstones 
which in Cheshire are 700 feet in thickness, and in North Yorkshire may 
be seen in the Howardian district and about the Tees estuary. These are 
the beds which yield Kock Salt and the most plentiful supply of gypsum. 
In Nottinghamshire they form the subsoil of the claylands of the eastern 
part of the country, their escarpment being visible in a well denned chain 
of low hills which crosses the great north road above Markham Moor. 
The beds sink gradually beneath the diluvial sediment of the great plain 
which is drained by the Trent. 

TJu Oolitic system. The Lias series. For the typical section and for 
the greatest thickness of the Lias formation we must go to Cleveland, 
where it forms the lower part of all the moorland escarpments, and of 
most of the coast cliffs. Here we have it with strata as under, beginning 
from above. 

1st. The upper lias clay or shale, about 200 feet in thickness, the upper 
part a soft shale from which Alum is manufactured, the lower part firmer 
and harder, with bands of ferruginous and argillo-caleareous nodules, and 
a band containing jet. 

2nd. The Ironstone and Marlstone beds, about 150 feet in thickness, 
consisting of highly arenaceous shales and laminated calcareous sandstones, 
succeeded above by several bands of nodular and stratified ironstone, 
which are worked extensively. 

3rd. The lower Urn beds, from 300 to 600 feet in thickness, a nearly 
uniform mass of tolerably firm shale, with many layers of nodular iron- 
stone, and in some inland localities, laminated limestones at the bottom.

The greater part of the series may be best examined in the coast cliffs. 
It first makes its appearance from under the sandstones of the Inferior 
Oolite at Blea Wykc*, nine miles north of Scarborough. From this point 
it rises gradually to the steep cliffs on the south side of Robin Hood's Bay, 
where it reaches 270 feet above high water mark. Here it is thrown up 
on the north by a dislocation so considerable that 300 feet of the lower 
shale is exposed, with 40 feet of the ironstone and marlstone series above 
it and the whole thickness of the upper shale. From this point to Bay- 
town the beds range nearly level, but on the north they dip so rapidly that 
within little more than a mile of the village the lower shale again sinks 
beneath the surface and in a mile more the ironstone series does the same. 
Opposite Hawsker only a small portion of the upper shale is seen at the 
base of the cliffs. Towards the cliff upon which Whitby Abbey stands it 
rises slightly, but north of the Esk as far as Sandscnd the whole series is 
depressed beneath the surface by dislocations, and for three miles the coast 
is guarded by banks of clayey diluvium piled upon a floor composed of the 
sandstones of the Inferior Oolite. 

At Sandsend we have the cliffs again with the upper shale 150 feet 
thick. At the Kettleness Alum Works the softer portion of the upper 
shale is 150 feet in thickness, the firm lower nodular band 30 feet, a 
band of soft shale beneath it 20 feet thick and at the base 20 feet of firm 
shale, and the upper ironstone beds form projecting scars. Along the 
line of the Runswick stream a fault of about 40 feet elevates the beds on 
the north. For some distance beyond Runswick the firm lower band of 
the upper shale forms the base of the cliffs but as we approach Staithes 
it rises and the Ironstone beds again appear. Not far from Staithes there 
is an oblique dislocation of 15 feet, depressing the beds towards the north. 
Along the line of the Staithes stream is a third and larger dislocation, 
with an effect of about 150 feet, which lifts to the top of the cliff on the 
north side of tho harbour lower members of the Ironstone set of beds than 
are to be Been above the surface of the ground on the .south side of it. 
In the magnificent cliffs of Boulby, which are 660 feet in height, we have 
a beautiful section of the series, including all its members from the top bed 
downward to a depth of 100 feet in the lower shale. From this point 
this lower bed sinks almost to the sea level across Skinningrove Bay, 
rising again in Huntcliffe to 180 feet and sinking to 50 feet at the termi- 
nation of tho cliff at Saltburn ; and its beds form the ranges of rock which

from the sandy beach at Redcar extend for about a quarter of a mile into 
the sea. 

From this point the series spreads inland to form the floor of Eston Nab 
and its upper boundary is continued along the edge of the hills by way of 
Upleathara, Highcliff, Roseberry Topping, Leven head, Burton head, and 
the northern edge of the escarpment of the great moorland mass. In 
Roseberry Topping it attains 1000 feet, the average rate of dip north east 
towards Boulby being 46 feet per mile and duo north to Eston Nab 80 
feet per mile. Its upper limit is usually marked with great distinctness 
beneath the oolitic sandstones, which everywhere cover it on the higher 
levels, but as we proceed towards the west, the upper band becomes more 
arenaceous in character as compared with the coast sections and can be no 
longer worked profitably for Alum. Opposite Stokesley the series attains 
its maximum elevation of 1200 feet. The Esk runs down a synclinal fold 
or trough of the lias and both in the main dale and along all its tributary 
streams the liassic beds are everywhere exposed by denudation of the 
sandstone of the moor tops. From the Stokesley tract due east to the 
High Peak, its average dip is at the rate of 43 feet per mile, and in the 
direction of Whitby, east by north, it is 55 per mile. In the dales of the 
great moorland mass from Snailesworth eastward by way of Bilsdale, 
Brandsdale, Farndale, Rosedale and Newtondale, it is also exposed by 
denudation, thickest in their upper parts and descending gradually along 
their edges as we pass from north to south. Beyond the western flank of 
the hill country, where the escarpment turns due south, it extends in an 
undulated slope which is generally about four miles in breadth, the outer 
edge of which reaches as far west as the Cod Beck at Thirsk and the 
Swale at Topcliffe. In the Vale of Mowbray the Ironstone and Marlstone 
band is just traceable and the upper shale is best seen in Cotcliffe wood 
and on the banks of the stream below Osmotherley. A narrow band of 
liassic beds still continues through the low country from Topcliffe in the 
direction of Easingwold and Sheriff Hutton. At Brandsby, 19 miles south 
of the point of its maximum elevation, the surface of the Lias is 280 feet 
above the sea level, which gives an average declination in this direction 
of about 50 feet per mile. From this point it forms the lower part of the 
slope of the Howardian hills towards the south as far east as the Derwent. 

The Inferior or Bath Oolite series. The beds of the Lower Oolite, as 
shewn in the coast sections, are as follows, beginning with the uppermost, viz. 

1. The Cornbrash, a thin fissile, partially oolitic limestone, 5 to 10 feet 
in thickness, remarkably filled with fossils.

sisting of irregular beds of thick sandstone, with layers of shale and bands 
of ironstone nodules inter-stratified amongst them, and enclosing also one 
or two thin coal seams. 

8. Shelly, somewhat oolitic limestone beds, much intermixed with claya, 
sand and ironstone, in thickness varying from 30 to 60 feet. 

4. The Lower Sandstone and Shale bede, about 500 feet in thickness, en- 
closing ironstones and two distinct, although irregular, layers of coal. 

5. The Dogger beds, from 10 to 70 feet in thickness, consisting of irregu- 
larly developed subcalcareous sandstones, much mixed with iron, with 
bands of shells and plants. This bed in some places passes by a gradual 
transition into the Upper Lias shale beneath it. 

The Cornbrash is first seen to emerge from beneath the strata of the 
Middle Oolite between Filey and Scarborough. In Gristhorp cliff, which 
attains 295 feet above high water mark, we have the Cornbrash and 50 
feet of the upper sandstones. The strata rise towards the north and in 
the lower beds of sandstone here many fossil plants have been found.* 
In an island opposite Redcliff the third or calcareous bed is just seen at 
low water, but by a fault on the north side of it the beds are depressed 
about 140 feet and by a landslip in Cayton Bay the strata of this series are 
hidden altogether. 

Immediately beyond the bay we have the Upper Sandstones again 
rising towards the north, and at Ewe Nab the calcareous bed rises above 
high water mark, to disappear in the cliffs round Cornelian Bay but to re- 
appear at the White Nab. From this point to Scarborough the Upper 
Sandstones form the great mass of the cliff, capped in one place by the 
Cornbrash, and the lowest stratum of the Middle Oolite, whilst a consider- 
able Burface of the calcareous bed is exposed at low water. At the Castle 
Hill the beds of this series are altogether depressed beneath the surface, 
but as we pass towards the north they rise again, and soon the Cornbrash 
terminates, and for some distance the Upper Sandstones, with a mass of

diluvium over them, make up the whole of the cliff, which here is under 
200 feet in altitude. At Cloughton Wyke we have on the top of the cliff 
thick beds of .block sandstone belonging to the lower part of the Upper 
Sandstones, beneath it a considerable thickness of shale with ironstone 
balls, then 6 feet of nodular shaly limestone full of shells, I } feet of shale, 
again a bed of nodular Bhaly limestone full of shells,, 2\ feet of shale, 
then soft calcareous layers with shells and lowest of all the solid subcalca- 
reous sandstone of the third set of beds, with a few fossils and accompani- 
ed by ironstone and calcareous shale. The strata still continue to rise 
towards the north and soon the Lower Sandstone and Shale beds make 
their appearance, with a coal seam about a foot in thickness. At Hayburn 
Wyke there are considerable marks of dislocation. Prom this point to the 
High Peak the cliffs rise in altitude from 296 to 585 feet above high water 
mark. In this long line of magnificent precipices we have very nearly 
the whole of this series of strata exposed so as to allow of ready examination, 
for although opposite Staintondale a landslip hides the lower part, yet by 
combining what is seen on the north and south of it we obtain an excellent 
section as follows, viz : â€” 

1. The Upper Sandstone : carbonaceous gritstone, with black shales and 
carbonised wood. This is 40 feet in thickness and is quarried at the edge 
of the cliff. 

2. Shelly Limestone with shale, 30 feet. 

8. The Lower Sandstone and Shale beds : 130 feet of sandstone and shale 
beds in numerous alternations, with fossil plants and traces of coal : 60 
feet of thick sandstone : 200 feet of thin sandstones and thick shales in 
numerous alternations, with fossil plants : 20 feet of white gritstone, 10 of 
shale, 20 of gritstone, with ironstone and fossil plants, 10 of shale. The 
total thickness of this set of beds is 450 feet. 

4. The Dogger beds (best seen at Blea Wyke.) 30 feet firm grained 
yellow irony sandstone with layers of pebbles and numerous shells ; 20 
feet softer sandstone with irony masses of shells [and 20 feet argillaceous 
fissile sandstone, also with shells, which forms a transition to the Upper 
Lias Shale. 

These thick Lower Sandstone and Shale beds form the cap rock of most 
of the Cleveland hills and in most places as far as their termination at 
Saltburn cover the Lias in the coast cliffs. This set of beds may be seen 
inland forming scars at Arncliffe woods near Egton Bridge, Danby Crag, 
Hunteliffe, Roseberry Topping, Wainstones, in Bilsdale, Newtondale and 
many other localities. North of the Esk it attains an elevation of 98ft

feet in Danby Beacon, and 1057 feet in Roseberry Topping. The same 
shells that are found in the Dogger beds at the Peak are met with inland 
in Goathland dale and in the escarpment of the Cleveland .lulls opposite 
Stokesley. The coal seam of the Lower Sandstone, which is shewn on the 
coast north of Cloughton Wyke, is known and sometimes worked in most 
of the southern dales of the Esk district. The calcareous beds which in- 
tervene between the two thick masses of Upper and Lower Sandstone 
cannot be traced very distinctly amongst the moorlands, but they are 
known in some of the southern dales of the Esk and also in Commondale 
and Scugdale. This Lower Oolite series forms the higher levels of all the 
moorland mass along the line of watershed between the Esk, the Leven, 
and the Derwent, the culminating points of which attain an elevation of 
1000 feet in Lilhow Cross, 1400 feet in Loosehoe Moor, 1485 feet in 
Burton Head and 1427 feet in Dromanby Bank. This summit of drainage 
is in fact the line of an anticlinal axis of these strata, which runs east and 
west and from which they dip towards the north and south. Where the 
beds of this series sink beneath the tabular hills of the Middle Oolite, 
these latter rise above them in a conspicuous escarpment, so that the line 
from Hambleton End to Scarbro* which marks the disappearance of this 
series from the upper levels is easily traceable. On the western flank of 
the moorlands opposite Thirsk we have upwards of 200 feet of Middle 
Oolite on the surface, and upwards of 600 feet of the Lower Oolite shewn 
beneath it as under, the surface of the series being about 850 feet above 
the sea level ; 

1. A trace of the Cornbrash. 

2. The Upper Sandstone and Shale beds, 250 feet in thickness, with 
ironstone and carbonaceous bands. 

3. Calcareous oolitic and shaly beds, 30 feet thick, with irony bands. 

4. The Lower Sandstone and Shale beds, 320 feet thick, with ironstones, 
one 3 feet bed and several bands, also with bands of cement nodules, and 
a coal seam. 

5. Calcareous, shelly, partly oolitic ironstone, 7 to 12 feet thick, 
20,000 tons to the acre, over it in some places shale with a band of 
ironstone nodules. 

In the Howardian tract this series forms a narrow terrace which extends 
from the hollow along which the Thirsk and Mai ton Railway runs to 
the Derwent at Crambeck, its beds sloping towards the east and north- 
east. The highest part of the ridge is towards the north-west, where it 
attains an elevation of upwards of 500 feet. The most noteworthy feature

which the series, in this part of its course, presents is a change in the cen- 
tral calcareous bed, which here assumes an aspect of more decided differ- 
ence than heretofore as compared with the sandstones which surround it, 
and becomes divided into two distinct portions, the upper band slaty and 
fissile, and the lower typically oolitic, the two being separated from one 
another by sandstone and blue clay. This is best seen in the neighbour- 
hood of Brandsby and Terrington. There is also a cap of this series over 
the Lias in the hill at Craike near Easingwold and in the vale of Mowbray 
the south end of Cotcliffe wood. 

The Cleveland basaltic dyke. This is a remarkable dyke of dark colour- 
ed basaltic rock, nearly vertical in position, generally about 60 feet in 
horizontal thickness, which although in some places not exposed at the 
surface may with tolerable certainty be presumed to extend continuously 
from Cockfield Fell in Durham across the Tees by way of Stainton and 
Great Ayton to Eskdale and Goathland dale and which terminates within 
four miles of the sea a short distance south-west of Whitby. Its total 
length is about 60 miles. The strata which it penetrates are, in Durham 
the Mountain Limestone, the Millstone Grit and the Coal Measures ; in 
North Yorkshire the New Red Sandstone, the Lias and the Lower Oolite. 
By some geologists it is supposed to be connected with the Teesdale Whin- 
Sill, but although it is quite possible that it may owe its origin to the same 
centre of igneous disturbance it is quite evident that the Cleveland dyke 
is much later in the date of its protrusion than the Teesdale mass. Gen- 
erally its sides are are not quite perpendicular and the beds on the north 
of it are somewhat depressed. In some places a tendency towards the 
prismatic type of structure is observable in its masses. In the neighbour- 
hood of the Tees it is quite overlaid by the glacial diluvium. In the 
Ayton tract it forms a conspicuous ridge and at Langbargh and in Kildale it 
is extensively quarried for roadstone. From this last mentioned dale its 
course lies along the dale of the Esk for some distance in a line not from 
the river. At Egton Bridge it forms a steep scar in Limber hill, on the 
south side of the Esk and from thence turns south-east to the head of 
Iburndale, and at last, after becoming considerably reduced in thickness 
it is lost amongst the thick sandstones of the moorland mass not far from 
the point where the main branch of the Derwent takes its rise. 

The Middle or Oxford Oolite series. The beds of this series form the 
upper levels of the range of tabular hills which is situated on the south of 
the moorlands of the Lower Oolite. Except where it is broken through by 
the dales of the Derwent district this range extends continuously from

within five miles of Thirsk eastward to the sea-coast, measuring thirty-fir* 
miles from east to west. The elevation of its table land above the sea- 
level lessens as we proceed from west to east with remarkable regularity. 
Hambleton End is 1289 feet high, Easterside 1048 feet, Helmaley Moort 
1078 feet, Levisham Moor 832 feet, Hackness Moor 714 feet, Oliver* 
Mount 490 feet and Gristhorp Cliff 295 feet. Along the whole of this 
line the beds of this series are escarped towards the north over the Lower 
Oolite with considerable abruptness. From Hambleton End the rungs 
extends due south by way of Kepwick Bank (1234 feet), Boltby Bank 
(1075 feet), Whitstoncliff (1056 feet), and Bolston Scar (950 feet), the 
series being elevated along all this line of the western flank of the moor- 
lands upon from 800 to 900 feet of Lower Oolite and Lias, its cliffs from 
this elevation overlooking the Vale of Mowbray with striking effect. 
From Kolston Scar the embankment, still a steep one, turns due east by 
way of Oldstcad Bank and Wass Bank to Oswaldkirk and Stonegrave, and 
from this point, as well as along the south of the main portion of the 
range, its beds slope gradually towards the east and south till they are 
lost beneath the Vale of Pickering. 

The general section of the series may be stated as under, beginning 
with the beds from above, viz : 

1. Upper calcareous gritstone, 60 feet 

2. Oolitic limestone, with abundant remains of corals, 60 feet. 
8. Lower calcareous gritstone, 100 feet. 

4. The Oxford Clay, a soft grey argillaceous stratum, 150 feet. 

5. The Kelloways bed, a firm ferruginous or argillaceous sandstone, 40 
feet in thickness. 

In the coast cliffs the upper calcareous gritstone is not anywhere seen. 
The first appearance of the beds of this series as we proceed from south to 
north is at the remarkable promontory called Filey Brig, where its firm up- 
per beds, the lower calcareous gritstone and the lower part of the coralline 
oolite, form a grand natural pier and breakwater. About 25 feet below the 
surface of the calcareous gritstone is a more arenaceous band than the rest, 
which contains a number of hard siliceo-calcareous balls, and this band 
with its imbedded natural cannon balls is constant throughout the range of 
this bed and may be seen both in the Scarbro' Castle hiU and the cliffs on 
the western flank of the range of hills near Thirsk. About a mile on the 
north of Filey the Oxford Clay appears ; and in Gristhorp cliffs we have 
beneath 8 feet of diluvium, 30 feet of the lower part of the lower calcare- 
ous gritstone, 40 feet shewing a gradual transition between this and the

Oxford Clay, 120 feet of the Oxford Clay, 25 feet of the Eelloways sand- 
stone, with 55 feet of the beds of the Lower Oolite series beneath them. 
At Redcliff, by the 140 feet dislocation of which we have already spoken, 
we have on the north the Eelloways band brought nearly down to the 
shore and the whole series shewn in the cliff of 285 feet as high as the 
lower part of the lower calcareous gritstone. By the landslip in Cayton 
Bay we have the Oxford Clay brought down to the shore-level, with a cliff 
of lower calcareous gritstone over it Between the White Nab and Scar- 
bro' only the Eelloways sandstone is seen, and this caps the Lower Oolite 
only in one particular locality. In the Castle *hill at Scarbro' we have all 
the beds from the Coralline Oolite, 40 feet in thickness, downwards, with 
a remarkable dislocation on the northern face of the hill by which a narrow 
band is uplifted so that the Eelloways sandstone is brought to a level with 
the lower part of the lower calcareous gritstone on either side of it At 
the pier the Eelloways sandstone occupies the shore, but on the north of 
the Castle hill except in the uplifted portion, we have the Oxford Clay 
135 feet in thickness. In the low cliffs on the north of Scarbro' the beds 
rise gradually, and before we reach Scalby the series disappears, and is not 
again seen. 

The Upper Calcareous Gritstone covers the Coralline Oolite in various 
inland localities, as at Silpho Brow near Haclcness, and in several places 
in the low ground about Eirby-moorside, Helmsley and Ampleforth. 
The Coralline Oolite and Lower Calcareous Gritstone form everywhere the 
surface and upper levels of the range of moorlands, often passing one into 
the other by gradual stages of transition. At the western extremity of 
the range we have the Calcareous Gritstone well exhibited in the conspic- 
uous precipices of Whitstoncliff, Boltby Scar and Ttolston Scar, at the first 
mentioned station forming a perpendicular cliff just 100 feet in depth. 
Here the Oxford Clay below the cliffs is considerably thinner than in the 
coast sections ; but the Eelloways sandstone may be traced from Scarbro' 
â€¢long the northern escarpment of the range to the Think tract with but 

Beside the main range of moorlands which have been described a narrow 
terrace of the beds of this series stretches from the Gilling hollow opposite 
8tonegrave eastward to the Derwent by way of Hovingham, Barton and 
Malton, bordering the Howardian terrace of Lower Oolite on the north, 
its beds sloping towards the north east till they sink into the vale of 
Pickering. 

Tk$ Kunmeridge Clay and Oault mi*. The latest deposits of the 
Oolitic period which we have in Yorkshire are a series of argillaceous beds

which overlie the limestones of the Middle Oolite and which correspond 
partly to the Kimmeridge Clay which underlies in the South of England 
the Portland Limestone and partly to the Lower Cretaceous formation. 
On the coast of the East Riding we have, rising from beneath the Chalk 
at Speeton to a height of about 200 feet above the highwater mark, a 
series of beds of dark blue clay, which in some places are much contorted 
and inter-laminated with nodules of argillaceous ironstone. Within a 
mile of their first appearance they sink beneath the shore-level and till we 
reach Filey Brig the coast line is guarded by massive banks of diluvium. 
Judging from the fossils of these beds the upper portion of them is coeval 
with the Gault which in Sussex and Cambridgeshire underlies the chalk 
and the lower part with the Kimmeridge Clay. This lower part stretches 
round the edge of the beds of the Middle Oolite series to Helmsley and 
Kirby-moorside and in its inland course lower beds than any of these 
which are exposed in the coast section are seen, with thin bands of calca- 
reous gritstone interlaminated amongst the clay and above them layers of 
Ostrea delta. The beds of this series evidently underlie the whole of the 
vale of Pickering, which embraces an area of 160 square miles, r one half 
of which belongs to the North Riding. South of the northern edge of the 
vale, they are overlaid by a considerable thickness of diluvium, but they 
reappear in several places along the margin of the Wolds. 

Close of the Secondary period. It is evident that during the deposition 
of all these Oolitic strata the sea bed on the east of the Palaeozoic hills 
was many times upraised and depressed, for although the great mass of 
this wide range of deposits is of marine origin, yet in some places there 
are amongst the fossils which they contain evident tokens that land was 
sometimes elevated above the surface of the waters in the tract where and 
whilst these beds were in course of accumulation. In the East Riding 
there are marks of a considerable elevation of the surface, which must 
have taken place towards the close of the Oolitic era. A line of anticlinal 
axis runs from east to west and the beds slope from this line both towards 
the north and south. Upon the Oolitic strata the Chalk of the Wold 
hills rests unconformably in the same way that we have already seen the 
Magnesian Limestone resting upon the deposits of the Carboniferous 
system ; and before the Chalk was deposited there has evidently been a 
considerable waste of the elevated Oolite, for in some places along the line 
of anticlinal axis the upper beds are altogether swept away and the Chalk 
if placed in juxta-position with the Lias. As we have it in Yorkshire the 
Chalk is entirely a marine deposit, but there is none of it within the 
limits of the North Riding.

The Tertiary period â€” The glacial diluvium. For a long time during 
the early part of the Tertiary period we may suppose the general contour 
of the surface of our district to have been very much as it is now, the vale 
of Pickering an arm of the sea, the central valley also submerged, and on 
the east and west of this broad gulf a mass of elevated land rising above 
them in the same way that the two moorland ranges rise now. Of the 
beds of the Eocene system down to those of much later date we have no 
traces in North Yorkshire, though the shelly deposit at Bridlington seems 
nearly coeval with the Crag of the Eastern counties. The animal remains 
which belong to the close of this long period of rest have been held to in- 
dicate the prevalence of a climate much more tropical in character than 
our present one. The North Yorkshire Fauna of this preglacial epoch 
includes the Elephant, the Rhinoceros and the Hippopotamus, and the 
celebrated cave of Kirkdale, where most of these remains have been found 
and which is considered by Dr. Buckland to have been at this time a den 
of Hyenas, is elevated very slightly above the present sea-level. Besides 
these tropical species, north temperate Mammals also occur, the Megaccros, 
Red Deer, Ox, TJrus, Wolf and Fox. 

But again subsidence ensued, extending through the whole of the district 
and bringing with it a depression so thorough that only what are now the 
higher levels of the moorlands still remained exposed above the surface of 
the ocean. The main current of the inundation has evidently flowed from 
the north-west towards the south-east, for we find that large blocks of the 
Granite of Shap fell and other peculiar rocks of the Cumbrian Mountains 
have been carried by it over the Pennine ridge, which at its lowest 
point is elevated 1450 feet above the sea-level, and not only distributed 
through the central valley and borne to the foot of the Hambleton Hills 
and the Wolds but also carried as far as Holderness and other parts of our 
eastern coast-line. It is also evident that at the time of this tremendous 
inundation the general outline of the hills was the same as it is now, for 
the main current has broken over the lowest part of the ridge and swept 
down the Stainmoor hollow. It is now very generally supposed by geolo- 
gists, that, unlike the period which immediately preceded it, the era of the 
inundation was a time of intense cold, that what are now the higher 
mountains were then islands in such a sea as we have at the present day 
only in the Polar regions, islands with glaciers in the hollows which radi- 
ated from their icy peaks, and that huge sailing icebergs furnished the 
means of transit lor the larger masses of rock which have been carried to a 
great distance from their original or earlier places of localization. The

result of this inundation, so far as our field of study is concerned has been 
an extensive and long continued denudation of the upraised and softer 
portions of the surface and the deposition of what was thus swept away in 
irregular beds over the Tallies. Everywhere, in the shape of confused 
heaps of gravel and clay and sand, this glacial diluvium covers the lower 
levels of the surface. On the sea-coast we have it on the cliff tops, and in 
Borne places, as for instance between Redcar and Saltburn, between Sand- 
send and Whitby, and about the Spa at Scarborough, a sea-bank which 
rises up to a height of 100 or even 200 feet above high water mark is en- 
tirely composed of it. In the interior of the country over an area of six 
hundred square miles these deposits of the glacial epoch almost entirely 
hide from view the New Red Sandstones of the Central Valley and the 
Oolitic Clays of the Vale of Pickering. Often the waterworn pebbles 
which its masses enclose may be identified without difficulty. Sometimes 
they contain the contributions of far distant hills and we may see the 
Ammonites and Gryphites of the Lias lying side by side with the Granite 
of Cumberland, the Basalt of Teesdale and the Crinoidal Limestone of the 
Palaeozoic moorlands of the west, but more usually the imbedded stones are 
evidently derived from adjacent strata. 

After the subsidence of this inundation we have nothing further of 
importance to chronicle, and so with a table of thickness of the beds, as 
nearly as we are in a position to register it, and of the area of the surface 
which they cover, this chapter may be brought to a conclusion.

CHAPTER II. 



CLIMATOLOGY. 

Zone* of altitude. # In "Watson's " Cybele Britannica " the surface of 
Britain is considered as divided into two what are called " Regions n of 
temperature ; and each of these regions is subdivided into three what are 
called " Zones." These two regions are divided from one another by the 
line of possible cultivation, which may be placed at about 600 yards in 
the North of England and declines to from 500 to 400 yards above the sea 
level in the North of Scotland. That portion of the surface which is 
above this line is called the Arctic Region, and what is below it is called 
the Agrarian Region, the three zones of each being respectively named 
8uper, Mid and Infer-arctic, Super, Mid and Inferagrarian. Divisions 
such as these may be employed with great advantage when we wish to 
indicate the broad general features of that important department of climate 
which is included under the head of temperature and they arc exceedingly 
useful to help the mind to connect together those districts which under a 
comparatively southern degree of latitude have their temperature lowered 
by elevation with those tracts which have a similar temperature under a 
more northern position. But at the same time, we must, in using them, 
be careful to remember that it is broad general similarities and contrasts 
only which they will enable us to express and that each, by imperceptible 
stages of gradations, glides into those which come next to it in place. 

â€¢ For numerous data and for information respecting various point* not touched upon here reference 
may be made to the chapter on Climate in Phillip,*' " Rivers, Mountains and Sea coast of Yorkshire." 
For a full account of the zone* of altitude sec Watson's Cybele Britannica, vols. 1 and 4. The most 
complete and carefully prepared statistics which we have respecting the climate of different parts of 
England are those contained in the Quarterly Reports of the Registrar general, the Meteorological 
portion of which is edited by Mr. Glaisher. From these nearly all the table* here used are taken.

The Inferagrarian zone includes the lower levels of the surface in the 
country south of the estuaries of the Dee and the Humber, the Midagra- 
rian zone the lower levels of the district which extends from these as far 
north as the estuaries of the Tay and the Clyde, and the Superagrarian 
zone the lower levels of that portion of Scotland which is still unaccounted 
for. Above the limit of cultivation the three zones of the Arctic Region 
may be traced in ascending the loftier mountains of the north, a conveni- 
ent line of demarcation being furnished by the upper limit of Erica 
Tetralix to bound the lowest of the three in an upward direction, and of 
Calluna vulgaris to separate the two others. Numbering these zones 
from one to six, beginning with the warmest, we may conveniently and 
at the same time, comprehensively indicate the range of temperature 
which we possess within the limits of our field of study, as compared with 
that of Britain as a whole, by saying that we have in North Yorkshire 
three out of these six zones, the second, the third and the fourth, that the 
lowest levels of the surface are not warm enough to attain the compara- 
tively southern temperature of the Inferagrarian zone, nor its highest 
summits elevated enough to reach the comparatively colder temperatures 
of the two upper zones of the Arctic Eegion. These three zones then, we 
will adopt, and as there is no need to use long words where short ones 
will answer the purpose equally well, we shall speak of them throughout 
these notes simply as the Upper, the Middle and the Lower zone, the 
Upper being the Inferarctic, the Middle the Superagrarian and the Lower 
the Midagrarian of the " Cybele." 

Mean Temperatures in the Shade. For York we have two thoroughly 
reliable sets of observations, in both cases made with instruments manu- 
factured and corrected for special researches. The observations of the late 
Jonathan Gray extended from 1801 to^l825, three observations being taken 
daily and the results reduced to mean values by the proper tables. The 
observations of my valued friend John Ford at York have now extended 
over upwards of twenty years and are still continued. These have been 
made with one of Mr. Cook's thermometers, duly compared with the 
Meteorological Society's standard, and the results obtained have been 
reported in Mr. Glaisher's tables since the commencement of their issue. 
The following table gives the result of both sets of observations and also 
the temperatures of Greenwich, Exeter, Leeds and Edinburgh, the latter 
all taken either direct or at second hand, through Mr. Lowe's tables in 
Morton's Cyclopedia of Agriculture, from Mr. Glaisher's reports.

York the coldest and July the warmest month of the year, and between 
these termini there is a regular advance and retrogression. If we divide 
the year into seasons of three months each, reckoning December, January 
and February to be the months of winter, and for York take the mean of 
the two rows of figures which have been given, we shall obtain the follow-

The mean annual temperature of the coast of Cornwall is taken by 
Mr. Watson at 52, of the south coast of Devonshire at 51*, of Dorset- 
shire and Hampshire at 51, of Sussex at 50*, and of the south-east of 
Kent, in all these cases of the coast, at 50 degrees. The decrease 
in mean annual temperature along the eastern coast line of Britain 
amounts to only about 5 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale from south to 
north, that is to say, upon the average, one degree of temperature to 
two degrees of latitude. For slightly elevated localities in the interior of 
the country from London northward to Edinburgh the mean annual tem- 
perature is usually stated at from 47 to 49, 47 being about an average 
for the South of Scotland, 48 for the North of England and 49 for the 
Midland Counties, maritime stations being usually about one degree high- 
er than inland places under the same parallels of latitude. The difference 
between Summer and "Winter over the same tract is almost always between 
20 and 24 degrees. As a general rule wo may say that whilst towards 
the southeast of England as compared with York the annual means 
augment slightly and the summer temperatures more than the annual 
means, that towards the south-west the annual means mount still higher 
and especially that the winter is considerably warmer. In the interior of 
the country west of London tho Summer is warmer, and the hiberno- 
aestival difference greater than at Greenwich. At Exeter we sec that 
whilst the Summer is only one degree warmer than at York the Winter ia 
4 degrees warmer and the hiberno-sestival difference is under 20Â°. 
According to Mr. Abbey's observations for Bradford, extending over a 
period of 10 recent years, the mean annual temperature is 48,3, that of 
Summer 60,7 and that of Winter 36,3, which gives a hiberno-oestival dif- 
ference just one degree higher than that of York. In the south-west of 
Cornwall the hiberno-a&stival difference sinks down to 17 or 16, in Mr. 
Watson's East Highland province it is 91$ upon the average of nine 
stations, and for the North coast of Scotland and its outlying islands upon 
an average of four stations it sinks to 15. 

The difference between a continental and an imular climate, and tho 
influence which proximity to the sea exercises in reducing the hiberno- 
eestival difference by cutting down the extremes both of summer and 
winter temperature, will be best shewn by a table of parallel data to those 
contained in our last table for a few stations selected in different parts of 
the European Continent. The temperatures are given upon the authority 
of Henfrcy's " Vegetation of Europe."

The surface of a sea, it is well known, always becomes cooled and heat- 
ed much less rapidly than the surface of the earth. The gulf stream 
carries across the Atlantic a current of heated water from subtropical to 
high northern latitudes. For Europe the north-east and the south-west 
are the two great contending winds, the former being the cold polar and 
the latter the warm equatorial current. And it is the modification which 
these influences combined exert in disturbing the normal relations of 
temperature to latitude that gives York a summer of Lapland and a win- 
ter of Northern Italy or as we should perhaps rather say, Umea the summer 
of York and Milan the winter of York. And we have in the climate of 
Britain upon a small scale the same modification exemplified that we have 
in the climate of Europe upon a grand scale, the south-east more continen- 
tal, the south-west comparatively insular in its range of variation, and the 
north of England intermediate between them. 

At York the North-west, the wind which blows from the highest parts 
of the Pennine chain, is the coldest and the other two winds which con- 
spicuously lower the temperature arc, as might bo expected, the North and 
the North-east. The North-east is the most prevalent wind in March, and 
is frequent through April till July, but it would seem that before it reach-

ee the vale of York its bitterness is somewhat broken by the eastern hills. 
The South-west for the year taken as a whole, is at once the warmest and 
most frequent of the winds. The "West is the next highest in point of 
temperature and the East is high in Summer and Autumn ; and these 
three with the South all upon the average elevate the temperature. 

It is probable that the temperature of the rest of the low country 
throughout the Riding does not vary greatly from that of York : and that 
the differences which exist will be regulated by exposition and position 
with regard to the hill masses. No doubt the temperature of the level 
part of Cleveland will be lower than that of York, bounded as it is by a 
range of high hills on the south and open towards the north and east ; and 
no doubt the temperature of the level country is, by the proximity of ex- 
tensive tracts of moorland both upon the east and west, depressed to some 
extent below its proper average, and the temperature of the low part of 
North Yorkshire as a whole, is thus brought to be more upon an 
equality with the rest of the Midagrarian zone than it is with those parts 
of the Centre and South of England which the Inferagrarian zone 
comprises. 

"We do not possess for any maritime and elevated stations within our 
limits any records of temperature which come near to those of York as 
regards the period of time over which they have extended. During a 
comparatively few recent years Dr. Cooke and others have made observa- 
tions under the auspices of the Meteorological Society at Scarbro'. At 
two stations upon the banks of the South Tyne with a difference in alti- 
tude above the sea of 1300 feet my valued friend Thomas Sopwith mounted 
sets of instruments in 1856. The most elevated of the two, Allenheads 
is near the head of a branch of the South Tyne about ten miles from the 
nearest point of North Yorkshire, and some of the observations made there, 
as well as at his lowland station, I shall here appropriate. For York the 
temperatures for the decade of years ending with 1860 are considerably 
below the average which has been already stated and so I give these, the 
means, the average daily maxima and the average daily minima, along 
with those from Scarbro' and Allenheads up to 1860, as summarised from 
Mr. Glaiaher's tables.*

Scarbro' and Allenheads, in the first place let us observe, are both shut 
out from the south-west in a way that will have the effect of depressing 
their temperatures below the point which they might be expected to reach 
under moro favourable circumstances. Beckoning the decrease of temper- 
ature northward according to the formula which has been stated, 49 would 
be the isotherm of the North Yorkshire coast towns, but it seems likely that 
none of them really attain it within at least a degree. As regards average 
daily range our table shews York and Allenheads to be nearly upon a par 
throughout the year, and it shews well what a great difference there is in 
this respect between an inland and a maritime station, especially in the 
Spring months. The difference between the mean daily range at Scarbro' 
and York during the three months of Spring is within a fraction of six 
degrees. 

The difference in the distribution of temperature throughout the seasons 
of the year between the different places is also a point which must claim 
our attention. Dividing the year into seasons as before and taking for 
each station the mean of the three months we obtain the following result.

We have here for Scarbro' a hiberno-ajstival difference of only 17$ 
degrees, the reduction as compared with York, being effected by the 
lowering of the maritime temperature in Spring and Summer, whilst it is 
kept higher than at the inland station in Autumn and Winter. As com- 
pared with what it is at an inland station the warm weather is in fact 
postponed at the seaside. The winter temperature is warmer at the sea- 
side that at an inland locality because the sea cuts off the excessive cold. 
The spring temperature is warmer at the inland station than at the sea- 
side, because the sea absorbs heat from the air to make up for what it has 
given out in winter. The summer temperature is warmer at the inland 
station than at the seaside" because the sea cuts off the excessive heat 
The autumn temperature is warmer at the seaside than inland through the 
sea then giving out the heat it has absorbed in summer. This variation 
and the cutting off of the dally means are the change as regards tempera- 
ture which is brought about by a maritime situation. 

For a difference in level of fully 400 yards between York and Allen- 
heads a reduction of 3 degrees of mean annual temperature is under the 
average mark. The balloon experiments made under the auspices 
of the British- Association for the Advancement of Science give a 
diminution of one degree of Fahrenheit's scale for 276 feet For 
Central Europe Humboldt gives the diminution at one degree for 267 
feet The Registers kept at Bywell during exactly the same period as 
those at Allenheads give the mean annual temperature of that station at 
48,3, a difference of 5,2 degrees for 1300 feet, which is exactly 1 degree 
for 250 feet. Dr. Dalton long ago stated the diminution for the hills of 
the North of England at one degree for every hundred yards of elevation,

which for the air is probably not far from correct and furnishes a conveni- 
ent figure for calculation. Of course the rate at which temperature de- 
creases upwards will depend greatly upon exposition and other modifying 
influences. A station in a sheltered dale will be much warmer than one 
upon an exposed plateau at an equal elevation. Temperature will decrease 
more rapidly upon an isolated peak than where there is a greater mass of 
hill and at a more rapid rate, other things being equal, the higher we rise 
above the level country. The hiberno-aestival difference at Allenheads 
according to the preceding table is more like that of Scarbro' than that of 
York. The difference between Allenheads and York, which is 3,1 upon 
the mean of the year, sinks to 1,9 upon the average of the winter, rises to 
4,3 in the Spring, continues at 4 during the Summer and sinks again to 
2,2 in the Autumn, and although two sets of observations brought into 
comparison must of necessity yield very insufficient grounds upon which 
to establish general conclusions, yet one would suppose a priori and it 
also seems likely from other considerations, that the distribution of at any 
rate the dale temperatures throughout the seasons is after a manner inter- 
mediate between that of the open low inland country and the sea side, and 
that elevated of land like the sea-coast cut off the extremes of the year 

and postpone its warmth. And it is worthy of notice also that the differ- 
ence between the average daily maxima of Allenheads and York is nearly 
1 degree greater than the difference between their average daily minima. 

"We must take then the average temperature of the sea-side at 47 or some- 
thing over, with a hiberno-aestival difference of 17 or 18 : of the low in- 
land country at 46Â£ to 47^ with a hiberno-83stival difference of from 20 to 
23 : and taking 47 as the most likely basis to calculate from estimate the 
temperature of the Lower zone at from 44 or 45 to 47 or 47Â£, of the Middle 
zone at from 41 to 44 and of the Upper zone at from 39 to 41. 

According to the observations of Mr. Abbey, made day by day during 
1860 at Horton Hall near Bradford, as compared with the mean tempera- 
ture of the air in the shade at a height of four feet from the ground, the 
mean temperature of the air in the shade at 8 feet was 1 degree, at 6 feet 
0,5, at 3 feet 0,8, at 2 feet 2,1, at 1 foot 2,9, and upon the grass 4 degrees, 
in all these instances lower, and at one foot below the surface 1,6 higher. 

Maxima and Minima in the shade. Under this head a table giving the 
highest and lowest temperatures registered in our own district and in 
other localities at the same time, will, I think be more satisfactory than to 
take them as observed at different times. For the maxima I have taken 
the Summer of 1 849, for the minima the Winter of I860.

CLIMATOLOGY. 46 

The English and Welsh Counties in which upon the authority of the 
same list the thermometer sunk down to zero or below are Northumber- 
land, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Stafford, Derbyshire, Notts., Leices- 
tershire, Cambridge, Norfolk, Warwickshire, Suffolk, Brecknock, Hereford, 
Gloucester, Oxford, Berks., Bucks., Hertford and Essex. Here we see 
well exemplified what has already been pointed out â€” how that, the ex- 
tremes of winter cold are cut off upon and near the coast in the south and 
west and how that they are most extreme in the interior of the lowland 
country and in the east. Ben Rhydding, Harrogate, and Otley are all some- 
what elevated stations in West Yorkshire and at Allcnheads the minimum 
docs not fall so low as that of Bywell by 5 and as that of York by 12 
degrees. The four stations to which Mr. Legard's observations relate are 
each within five miles of the others. Easthorpe stands upon the calcare- 
ous Howardian terrace at an elevation of 350 feet above the sea-level : 
Castle Howard and Coneysthorp both upon the arenaceous Inferior Oolite 
at 250 feet and 200 feet respectively, and Kirkham upon the sandstone in 
the immediate vicinity of the Derwent at 50 feet lower than Coneysthorp. 
The fall of temperature does not grow greater here as we ascend, but 
precisely the contrary. In Scotland the average minimum for the stations 
of the Meteorological Society in the low part of Aberdeenshire was 6 
degrees below zero but at Braemar and Castle Newe, in the upper portion 
of the county, it did not sink below 8 and 10. At Edinburgh the minim- 
um was â€” 6, but at Wanlockhead, in Durafrieshire, which is 1333 feet 
above the sea-level it was 6. We shall have to speak further about the 
distribution of winter minima when we come to treat upon the topography 
of wild and cultivated plants. 

Mean Temperatures in the Sun and upon the ground. The foregoing 
tables, it will be observed, all relate to the temperature of the air in the 
shade. But, especially under an unclouded sky in summer time the direct 
action of the solar rays exerts a powerful heating influence, so that the 
average daily maxima of exposed places rise much higher than those 
which shaded positions reach. And at night the minimum of the ground 
is more or less below the minimum of the air. The following tables for 
Bywell and Allenheads give month by month in the first column the 
average excess of the daily maxima in the sun above those registered in 
the shade, and in the second the average fall of the nightly minima on 
the grass below those of the air. In the third for each locality the aver- 
age daily range in the shade is given, and by adding to this the other two 
numbers we obtain in the fourth column the extreme range of the 24

to which a thermometer placed upon the ground sinks down at night and 
the highest point to which one that is fully exposed to the sun's rays in

Here we see illustrated the immense power which the direct action of 
the sun exercises, a circumstance which, as Humboldt long ago remarked, 
it is very necessary that we should always remember to take into account 
when questions connected with temperature are under consideration. 
Comparing one station with the other we see that it is amongst the hills, 
where the air is thinner and lighter than in the low country, that the 
direct action of the sun produces the greatest effect ; but then to counter- 
balance this, the cooling process also goes on there with the greatest 
rapidity. The average daily range of temperature in the shade is not 
conspicuously different at the two stations at any period of the year, but 
the fall upon the ground at night below the minimum of the air is notab- 
ly the least throughout the year at the upland station, especially in

Winter and Spring. In fact, upon the average of the year the absolute 
minimum upon the grass is only lower at Allenheads than it is at By well 
by a fraction of a degree. 

Area in North Yorkshire of the three tone* of altitude. Recurring to 
our three zones of altitude we must next seek to ascertain what portions 
of the surface they respectively embrace and what are their characteristic 
features. The most suitable lines of limit would appear to be the 
contour lines which mark an elevation of 300 and 600 yards above the sea- 
level, that portion of the surface which is below 300 yards in elevation 
being considered as embraced in the Lower zone, the moorlands and upper 
part of the dales which range in height between 300 and 600 yards 
making up the Middle zone, and the summits of the peaks which rise 
above 600 yards the Upper zone. 

On the west the line of an elevation of 300 yards runs from the Tees at 
Winch Bridge within a short distance of the river a3 far as the Lune, up 
the Lune a little, round the edge of the fells above Romaldkirk, ascends 
Balderdale for a considerable distance, and thence is continued along the 
edge of Lartington Moor past nearly the head of Deepdale to the Greta 
near Bowes. From Bowes it curves considerably to the east to skirt the 
western bank of the dale of Gilling above Dalton and Kirby Ravensworth, 
and then turns to the west round Richmond Beacon to near the Swale at 
Applegarth, curving round the lower part of the dale of Marske and again 
coming sharply down to the Swale in the angle between the main dale and 
Arkendale. It ascends Arkendale to the foot of Shaw Beck, runs down 
the west side not far from the Arkle to Reeth Moor and from this point 
passes due westward not far from the Swale to Muker. South of the 
8wale it does not leave the river far as we proceed eastward from Muker 
to Downholme, and from thence it sweeps round the edge of Downholme 
Moor, Bellerby Moor and Leyburn Moor, runs along within a short dis- 
tance of the Yore as far west as Thwaite Bridge above Hawes, and there 
turning again towards the east passes Gale and beneath Bear's head, 
ascends Seamerdale to above the upper end of the lake, ascends Bishopdale 
Waldendale and Coverdale to within a short distance of their head-passes, 
coming out boldly towards the Yore round the edge of the ridges which 
separate them, and within a few miles of Masham it sweeps round 
Middleham Moor and the Colsterdale hiHs to the Riding boundary. From 
thin line to the western margin of the county all the surface is upwards of 
300 yards in height. 

Of the arenaceous oolitic hills of the east the Middle zone includes a

narrow ridge above Osraotherley and the summits of Inglcby Bank and 
Swainby Bank just reach it. On the north its boundary from Osmother- 
ley Moor curves past the head of Scugdale to Faceby Bank and Carlton 
Bank and from thence runs down the edge of Bilsdale for some distance 
and curves round the head of Snailes worth to Osmotherley Moor again. 
Between the forks of Bilsdale it includes the peaks and from Burton Head 
embraces the ridge of watershed as far to the east as Kosedale and Fryup- 
dale, with lateral ridges stretching out for some distance between the dale* 
which open out towards the south. Fast of this principal area the peak 
of Lilla Cross just reaches it and the same may be said of Kildale Moor 
on the north : but of the wide extent of undulated country north of the 
Esk only the two peaks of Roseberry Topping and Danby Beacon and the 
ridge of Guisbro' Moor are high enough to reach unto it. 

Of the tabular calcareous hills of the east the Middle zone includes the 
plateau from Black Hambleton southward by way of Kepwick Bank and 
Boltby Bank to W hitstonclifT and Rolston Scar, with a width at the north 
end of the ridge of fully two miles and extending eastward almost as far â–  
as the Rye. But towards the south the ridge which reaches into it be- 
comes narrower and opposite WhitstonclifF is not more than a mile wide, 
and east of this Hambleton plateau only just the summits of Hawnby Hill 
and Easterside attain it. 

Many of the western peaks reach into the Upper zone but nowhere does 
it include a continuous area of even moderate extent . Between the Tees 
and the Lune it can claim the ridge from Cronkley fell westward. Be- 
tween Arkendale and Swaledale Water Crag, Regan's Seat and Pin Seat 
reach it. Round the head of the Swale a crescent ridge rises into it 
which extends from Raven's Seat moor round the head of Whitstondale 
and Swaledale to Ladies Pillar, six principal peaks connected together by 
a narrow neck of elevated land. Between Swaledale and Wensleydale it 
includes the summits of Yore head, Shunnor fell and Lovely Seat, with a 
spur from this last towards the east. West of Widdale it includes a ridge 
about three miles in length and at the head of the dale Woe fell just reach- 
es it. South of Wensleydale it embraces a long narrow ridge from the 
head of Widdale eastward to the head of Bishopdale, with lateral spurs 
between each of the dales towards the north and a northern outlier in 
Bears' head. And lastly it includes a ridge between Coverdale and 
Colsterdale, of which Buckden pike and Great Whernside are the peaks, 
with a northern outlier which stands boldly out towards the main dale in 
Penhill.

Probably we shall not bo far wrong if we estimate that the Upper zone 
includes altogether some 20 square miles or about one per cent of the 
whole surface of North Yorkshire : the Middle zone about one fourth or 
one fifth of it : and the Lower zono the remaining portion or about three 
fourths of the whole. 

Characteristics of the tones of altitude. There is a scar of the Main 
Limestone upon the western edge of Micklefell at an elevation of from 750 
to 800 yards above the sea -level, and upon its summit ridge at an eleva- 
tion of 800 yards and upwards a number of rocky " swallow holes" in the 
recesses of which grow a few ferns and other shade or damp loving plants. 
There is a sort of limestone pavement like that of Craven, but upon a 
mnch less extensive scale, which rises into the Upper zono upon "Widdale 
fell and Cam fell, and this is also the case with one or two prominent 
14 edges " of gritstone in the tract of the great synclinal depression of the 
Carboniferous beds. With these exceptions the surface of the Upper zono 
consists entirely of the swells of the highest undulations of the moorlands, 
sometimes grassy, but more often a combination of heath and turfy swamp. 

The main dales of the west usually terminate at about 400 yards, the 
slope at their upper part from 100 to 550 or 600 yards being generally 
abrupt, but of course the mere water-channels run down from the fell tops. 
The summit of the Stainmoor pass is under 500 yards in elevation : that 
which leads out of the head of Swaledale is a little over 550 yards and 
that between Arkendalo and Gretadale is about 500 yards. At the head 
of Wensleydale the passes arc lower : that which leads into Garsdale is 
only 350 yards in height : that which leads into the dale of the Eden is a 
trifle over 400 yards : and that which leads out of Widdale into Dentdale 
and Ribblesdale is a little under 450 yards. Towards the south they are 
loftier : the summit of the road to Langstrothdale from Bisliopdale is 500 
yards in elevation and that from Coverdalc is nearly 50 yards higher still, 
whilst between Swaledale and Wensleydale the Buttertubs pass almost 
reaches the boundary of the Upper zone. Of the passes between opposite 
dales of different drainage systems amongst the eastern moorlands only a 
few reach the Middle zone, that between Scugdale and Snailcsworth, those 
which cross the Hambleton plateau and those of the highest part of the 
ridge of watershed between Esk and Derwent, the rest being all under 
300 yards. 

Throughout both the two lower zones cliffs and rocky banks are fre- 
quent amongst all the hilly tracts and their slopes and along the line of 
the sea-coast. Even in the Lower zone there is a wide extent of unculti-

vated heatherland both upon the east and west of the central valley ; and 
of course this is the case to a much greater extent in the Middle zone. 
Small tracts of uncultivated heath descend in some places to the lower 
levels of the central valley, but these are growing gradually smaller and 
fewer, and now fully one third of its area is occupied by arable land. 
The royal forest of Galtres, which extended from York to the Howardian 
"hills and from the Derwent to the Ouse was disforested in the reign of 
Charles the second, but several what are called "carrs," boggy piece* of 
ground more or less overgrown with trees and brushwood, still remain in 
the central valley undrained. The main body of the most elevated towns 
of the three western dales, Middleton, Muker and Hawes, is in each case 
at 300 yards or somewhat under. The only village which I remember 
that attains 3 50 yards is Kcld in Swalcdale. In Cleveland I do not know 
of any house so high as 300 yards. There is an inn upon the Ilambleton 
plateau considerably above 350 yards and numerous scattered farm-houses 
at 400 and up to 450 yards in all the three dales of the west. In Greta- 
dale the "Spital" at the summit of the Stainmoor pass is 1450 feet above 
the sea level, in Swaledale Crook Seat and two or three other farmhouses 
attain or exceed 500 yards, and there is an inn and two other houses 
near the Tanhill coalpit at 1600 feet. There is a shooting box upon 
Askrigg moor at 550 yards and another upon the edge of the east- 
ward spur of Lovely Seat not much under 600 yards, but above this I 
have not noticed anything but mere temporary sheltering places for 
shepherds and miners. 

Though trees are tolerably abundant in most parts of the vallies* both 
in hedgerows and in woods yet except in some of the carrs and occasion- 
ally by the streamsides we cannot safely regard them as indigenous in 
such situations. Woods are much more plentiful in the dales and amongst 
the lower levels of the sloi>os than in the low country apart from the hills 
and both by the streamsides and amongst the banks and cliffs of the east- 
ern and western ranges of moorland they arc in many cases evidently of 
aboriginal growth. Amongst the calcareous scars of the west and upon the 
steep banks of the dales of the calcareous hills of the east are the thickest 
and most extensive aboriginal woods which we possess. Respecting the 
altitudinal range of the indigenous trees details will be given afterwards.

the Middle zone. Above the Lower zone thick woods are rare and such as 
may be seen are often planted woods of Larch and Spruce and Scotch Fir. 
Of the other trees which are most usually planted the Horse-Chesnut 
and Fopulus balsamifcra both ascend to 350 yards. There is a nat- 
ural wood above Whitfell Gill near Askrigg at an elevation of 500 yards 
and upwards and a plantation of larches on Askrigg moor at 550 yards. 

The highest hawthorn hedge which I know is a little above 350 yards, 
and they are comparatively rare above 200 or 250 yards, the roads and 
fields amongst the moorlands being generally bounded by stone walls. In 
favourable situations in the low country the yield of Potatoes is 120 to 
150 bushels per acre, of Wheat 4 to 6 quarters and exceptionally 8, of 
Oats 0 to 9 quarters and exceptionally 10 or even 12, and of Barley 6 to 7 
quarters and exceptionally 8. Hordeum hexastichon is cultivated but 
rarely and I am not aware that Avena strigosa is grown at all. Rye also is 
but rarely grown. The other cultivated crops of the low country are 
Turnips, Flax, Beans, Peas, (Pisum arvense and sativum) Mangold Wurt- 
zel, and Brassica 2Japus. Chicory is grown principally in the neighbour- 
hood of York and a field of Dipsacus Fullonum is to be seen occasionally. 
For forage Vicia sativa, Trifoliu'm pratense, T. repens and Medicago 
lupulina are principally planted, and occasionally Trifolium incarnatum 
and Onobrychis sativa ; and of the Grasses Loliura italicum and a host of 
others. Upon the argillaceous soils of Cleveland the yield of Potatoes is 
from 150 to 200 bushels per acre, of Wheat 3 quarters and of Oats and 
Barley 4 quarters each. Wheat succeeds best in the central valley and is 
very little grown above 200 yards. The highest field which I remember 
to have seen was above Aysgarth at a little under 300 yards, and upon the 
Hambleton plateau above this elevation it succeeds so badly as to make it 
not worth growing*. On passing up the tlirce dales of the west very few 
cultivated fields are seen above Romaldkirk, Reeth and Aysgarth, the west- 
ern portion of North Yorkshire being entirely a mining and grazing tract. 
The western dales are celebrated for their short-horned cattle, and cheeses, 
Cleveland for its horses. In the Middle zone altogether there is probably 
under 20 square miles of arable land. Upon the Hambleton plateau theie 
are numerous fields at 350 yards and upwards, but I do not know of any 

â€¢ Dr. James Stark place* the limit of the Wheat region in Scotland at the line of the Summer tem- 
pera tore of 56 Fahr. On the west coast of Scandinavia Wheat ascends to the 61th, Oats to the 6."Â»th, 
Kye to the 67th and Barley to the 70th parallels of latitude. In the South American plateaux the 
culture of grain ceases at a mean annual temperature of 22* desrrecs above the fieezinp point, in Swit- 
zerland at 9 degrees shore it, in North Yorkshire at 11 or 12 degree* above it, whilst in Scandinavia

which attain quite 400 yards. Here Oats are grown at the rate of 4 1 to 
6 quarters per acre and Barley at the rate of 4 or 5 quarters, hut occasion- 
ally it happens, as was the case with some of the fields in 18G0, that the 
grain does not ripen and the crop has to be used for fodder. Potatoes and 
Turnips are also cultivated in fields upon the plateau. In the western dales 
small patches devoted principally to Potatoes may be seen up to 400 yards. 

Upon the Hambleton plateau the highest garden which 1 know is upon 
the contour line of 300 yards. Here Apples, Gooseberries and Red Cur- 
rants are grown, and in the Kitchen garden Potatoes, Cabbages, Cauliflow- 
ers, Carrots, Beans, Red Beet, Onions, Parsneps and Pisum arvense and 
sativum. I know of only one good garden which is clearly within the 
Middle zone, and that is at 350 yards at Keld in Swaledale. Here are 
grown Apples, Cherries, Gooseberries, Rasps, Red, "White and Black 
Currants, Strawberries, and two species of Rhubarb, and in the Kitchen 
portion of it Carrots, Turnips, Peas, Beans, Potatoes, Cabbage, Cauli- 
flower and Broccoli. The three latter cannot be kept through the Winter 
and the Apple and Cherry trees, though they grow vigorously, do not 
fruit freely. Parsley, Beet, Onions, Sage, and Mentha viridis are grown 
up to 350 yards in other places and in a small patch enclosed from the 
moor at Tanhill at 1G00 feet, Potatoes, Common Rhubarb, Cabbages, 
Turnips, Parsley, Onions, Cress & Sinapis alba have been cultivated. The 
Pear is grown up to 300 yards against walls and the Plum tree up to 250 
yards. The following is a complete list of all the ornamental shrubs known 
to me as cultivated at 350 yards or upwards. 

Cytisus Laburnum, Rosa rubiginosa, R. alba, R. centifolia, R. indica, Cy- 
doniajaponica, Fuchsia, Berberis ilicifolia, Ribcs sanguineum, Hedera helix, 
Sambucus nigra, Ilex Aquifolium, Syringapersica, S. vulgaris, Ligustrum 
vulgarc, Solanura Dulcamara, Lycium barbarum, Daphne Mezereon, 
Buxus sempervirens. 

The following horticultural data refer to the most favourably situated 
portions of the low country and illustrate principally the power of the 
heats of summer. The Apricot ripens so as to produce a fair crop once in 
two years. At Thirsk several trees arc trained against the sides of the 
houses in the public streets, and in a favourable year the fruit has been 
sold in the market at the rate of a shilling per score. The Black cluster 
Vine produces eatable fruit in the open air except in unusually unfavour- 
able years, but the Sweet Water does not succeed. The Walnut in favour- 
able situations will ripen its fruit every other year. The Hop fruits but 
rarely in the open air. The Spanish Chesnut does not fully ripen it* fruit

upon the tree, but usually the nuts though small are quite eatable after 
they have been kept for a fortnight. Figs will not unfrequently ripen in 
the open air against a south wall, but the trees require protection in 
Winter. The Peach and Nectarine are cultivated successfully ; in 1860 
some of the trees at Thirsk trained against a wall with a southern expo- 
sure were pronounced by the lessee of the Hampton Court gardens to have 
as fine fruit as his own, but these were killed by the ensuing 6evero 
winter. The Mulberry will not ripen every year as a standard but will 
usually do so when trained agiunst a wall with a southern exposure. In 
Cleveland the Vine and Spanish Chesnut do not ripen their fruit in the 
open air and the Mulberry hardly ever, but the Peach, Nectarine and 
Apricot usually ripen their fruit against brick walls with a southern 
exposure. 

Perhaps the best horticultural test of the power of the colds of winter is 
furnished by the ornamental shrubs, and here there does not seem to be 
any appreciable difference between the Cleveland low country and the 
Central valley*. The following list applies to both of these tracts, and 
contains the names of some of the commonest shrubs which are what the 
gardeners call " half-hardy," that is, are liable to be cut down and des- 
troyed by the frosts of winters which are somewhat colder than usual. 

Arbutus Unedo, Jasmlnum revolutum, Cistus ladaniferus, Buddlea 
globosa, Genista florida, Deutzia gracilis, Magnolia giandiflora, South 
European frutbose Cytisi, Tamarix gallica, T. germanica, Rhododendron 
arboreum, Cryptomeria japonica, Pinus excelsa, Laurus nobilis, Viburnum 
Tinus, Garrya elliptica. 

The minimum temperatures reached in various localities both within 
ami beyond our limits during the severe weather of the Christmas of 1860 
have already been stated. The following list applies to the North York- 
shire portion of the vale of York and is an attempt at horticultural 
appraisement of this unusually severe frost as tested by its influence upon 
trees and shrubs.

no doubt had a powerful influence in determining the effect upon vegeta- 
tion of the winter which ensued, so that no doubt we may for all ordinary 
purposes regard the foregoing as representing a maximum of injury. 
Often only the young wood of trees and bushes in the "killed" list was 
injured, but nothing has been included therein upon the faith of single or 
isolated cases. At Howsham one or two Beech trees and in the vale of 
Pickering several Ash trees were considerably injured and at Hildenley 
and elsewhere Acer campestre, and in the the neighbourhood of Drif- 
field several fine old trees of Salix alba and Populus nigra were destroyed. 
The damage to the latter-named species in the "injured" list was incon- 
considerable, but the three first were cut down to the ground in many 
places. 

In reply to my enquiry respecting the influence of proximity to the 
sea upon the cultivation of ornamental trees and shrubs, especially as 
tested by the Christmas of 1860 my friend W. Mudd of Great Ay ton 
writes in substance as follows. " Start from Marton and skirt the country 
by way of Ormesby, Eston, Lazenby, Wilton, Kirklcatham, Skclton, 
Lofthouse, Hinderwell, and Mulgrave Castle to Whitby, and I believe 
that between this line and the sea vegetation generally will be found fully 
two weeks in advance of the inland Cleveland country. As a general rule 
most trees and shrubs thrive better upon the inland than upon the sea- 
ward side of it. In the months of February, March and sometimes April 
the North, North-east and East winds often what we call " break " upon 
the edge of the hills and sweep the low country, cutting the tender 
shoots of trees and bushes both near the sea and in the interior. Along 
the line Lauras nobilis, Pinus exceisa, and Cedrus Deodara thrive and have 
stood the severe frosts but they are killed both upon the inland and sea- 
ward side of it. In dry situations at Ayton* facing the south Aucuba 
japonica stood the frosts of I860, but it was generally killed both inland 
and near the sea. Prunus lusitanica and lauro-cerasus were very slightly 
injured at Ayton, but at many places upon the line they were cut to the 
ground. Tho Holly was also cut to the ground upon the line, but inland 
Oak, Holly and Ivy were but little injured." 

We see above that in sheltered places near the sea some of the half- 
hardy shrubs of the low inland country can be grown successfully. This 
is the case at Scarbro' with Lauras nobilis and Jasrainum revolutum. 
The cutting off of winter minima in sheltered places amongst the hills is

fully borne out by horticultural data. Of the shrubs cultivated at Keld 
the only one which was injured in 1860 was Cydonia japonica. In Cleve- 
land only the Araucaria and the Deodar were killed, and whilst most of 
the species mentioned in the "killed" list for the central valley were 
injured, those mentioned in the " injured " list were hardly harmed at all. 
In the lower part of Wenslcy dale the damage was comparatively trifling, 
and the same was the case upon the arenaceous Howardian terrace at 
Terrington and upon the south side of the dale of the "Wharfe at Hare- 
wood. Upon the magnesian limestone at Knaresbro' Cryptoineria ja- 
ponica, Cedrus Deodarn and Garrya elliptica were not injured. If we 
make the circuit of the eastern range of moorlands we shall find almost 
always that where there are parks and gardens upon the hill-slope some of 
the half-hardy shrubs of the low country are grown successfully. This is 
the case in Cleveland with Laurus nobilis, Pinus cxcelsa and Cedrus Deo- 
dara, all of which stood the Christmas of 1860 in Kildale and at Ingleby 
Manor and Busby Fall. Viburnum Tinus thrives at Oswaldkirk and 
Laurus mbilis at Castle Howard much better than in the low countrv. 

â–  

At Mount St. John there is a tree of Laurus nobilis J 5 feet in height and 
Garrya elliptica succeeds well, but neither of them thrive at Thirsk, which 
is from 450 to 500 feet lower. "We cannot emulate at Thirsk tho luxuri- 
ant Roses of Ccxwold and Iticvaulx, climbing the wall sides of the cottages 
and wreathing round the windows of the upper stories, and in Autumn 
the Dahlias and other tender herbaceous plants are often cut down by 
frosts at Thirsk before they are reached upon the hill-side. Of the wild 
plants killed or seriously injured by the frosts of 1860 the Broom ascends 
to 300, the Oak and Furze to 400 and the Ivy and Holly to 450 yards 
amongst tho hills. 

A note by my friend James Backhouse, Junr. respecting the effect of the 
same frost upon a Deodar at York is also worth quoting for the sake of its 
climatic bearing. The first two feet of the tree above the snow were 
quite killed; at four feet it was comparatively little injured ; and at seven 
feet it was as fresh as it was where the snow completely protected it. 

Ascending and Descending wild plants. By far the greater number of 
the wild plants which we possess are most plentiful in the low country 
and become less frequent and finally run out as we ascend. The flower- 
ing plants and ferns to which this docs not apply, the Descending or 
Montane species, such as arc most plentiful amongst the hills and either 
altogether absent from or less frequent in the vales, are 86 in number. 
In the following list these are arranged under three classes and are further

For the Flowering Plants and Ferns this gives a proportion of about 
one twelfth to the Montane element in our flora as tested by number of 
species. If we include the Mosses in the calculation the proportion is 
doubled, and we have about 220 Montane species out of a total flora of 
1 300 species, as will be shewn in detail hereafter. As we ascend from the 
low country amongst the hills the number of species gradually diminishes, 
the Montane species which are added never compensating in number for tho 
Ascending species which cease. According to my present notes respect- 
ing the vertical range of our indigenous Flowering Plants and Ferns we 
have out of 100 species, at the coast level and below 100 yards 86, at 200 
yards 64, at 300 yards 50, at 400 yards 37, at 500 yards 27, at 600 yards 
17, at 700 yards 11, and at 800 yards 7. But in considering this propor- 
tion in connection with climate we must be careful to remember that, as 
we have already seen, we have as we ascend step by step, not only lower 
temperatures, but also a more restricted area of surface and a more restrict- 
ed range of situation. A large proportion of the species, as their localities 
beyond our limits indicate, are not prevented by causes connected with 
temperature from ascending to levels much higher than we anywhere 
possess them. This applies more especially to those which ascend into 
the two upper zones. The following lists contain a selection of species 
arranged according to their ascending limits. I have given them in leaps 
of 100 yards, twelve to each gradation.

Critical plants and doubtful natives again excluded, thirty-five of the 
Ascending species have in Britain their north limit in North Yorkshire. 
Four of these are confined to the coast, Medicago dcnticulata, Vicia bithy- 
nica, Hippohae rhamnoides and Salicornia radicans. Six are confined to 
the central vale and do not pass north of the neighbourhood of York, 
Viscum album, Carex paradoxa, Veronica triphyllos, Alopecurus bulbosus 
and Carduus pratensis. Five more arc confined to the vallies and do not 
pass north of the neighbourhood of Thirsk, Carex pseudo-cypcrus, Rumex 
palu8tris, R. maritimus, Potamogoton flabellatus and Polygonum mite. 
Four more are confined to the vallies but pass north of Thirsk, Teucrium 
Scordium, Nasturtium amphibium, Cerastium aquaticum and Eriophorum 
gracile. Two species, Chlora perfoliata and Anemone Pulsatilla ascend 
to the Magnesian Limestone. Four species ascend to 50 or 100 yards in 
the dales, Campanula patula, Epilobium roseum, Rumex pratensis, Carex 
axillaris; and one, Orobanche elatior, to 100 yards upon the limestone. 
Carex divulsa and Lamium Galeobdolon ascend to 150 yards in the dales ; 
Galium crectum, Dipsacus pilosus and Brachypodium pinnatum to about 
tho same height on the limestone. Acorus Calamus ascends to about 200 
yards on tho non-calcareous, Carex digitata to 250 yards on the calcareous, 
Festuca pseudo-myurus and Arcnaria tenuifolia to 300 yards on the non- 
' calcareous slope. 

Periodic Phenomena of Vegetation. A comparison of the times of the 
various periodical phenomena of vegetation as observed simultaneously 
in different localities may also be employed usefully in illustration of their 
climate. The following lists were made in the year 1856, the data for 
Thirsk resting on my own observation and nearly all of the others having 
been obtained through the help of kind correspondents resident in the 
localities to which they refer.

So much depends upon difference of soil and exposition, and in the case 
of the cultivated crops upon the time of sowing the seed, tho sort of seed, 
the state of tho cultivation of the land and the state of the weather at the

likely that none of the figures given above are far from being a correct 
representation of the postponement of the time as compared with Thirsk 
when the hay crop and harvest are ready in an ordinary season. The 
part of our field of study where they are ready first seems to be what wc 
may call the .Veronica triphyllos tract, a surface of light sandy ground 
which is situated on the Acomb side of York and has something of a 
southern slope. Between York and Thirsk the average difference is not 
material ; the gardeners say that at Thirsk vegetation is somewhat more 
liable to be harmed by spring frosts, but that they can usually compete in 
the York market with the early culinary vegetables grown in the open 
air with the neighbourhood of York but not with Doncaster and Ponte- 
fract. Between these as grown at Thirsk and in the garden at 300 yards 
upon the Hambleton plateau there is a difference of about a month. 
Lythc, though near the sea coast, is in an exposed position and the soil is 
argillaceous. Hovingham, with an argillaceous soil and situated upon the 
slope towards the north of the calcareous Howardian terrace is 10 days 
later than Thirsk. Between the light sandy soils over the New Red 
Sandstone on the west of Thirsk, and the clayey soils of the undulated 
liassic tract on the east of the town there is a difference of a week or ten 
days in favour of the former, and as we approach tho foot of the hills, 
where the soil is still clayey, of a fortnight or three weeks. A month 
appears to be about a fair average of the difference between the earliest 
crops over a considerable tract of the Central valley and an elevation of 300 
yards amongst the hills on both sides of it, that is to say an average of ten 
days per hundred yards. It is not unfrequent for the wandering labour- 
ers who come to Thirsk to be engaged for one month for the harvest in the 
low country, and when that is finished to get employment for another month 
upon the top of the Hambleton plateau. Especially in the west the in- 
gathering of the crops in the hilly district is much more liable to bo 
retarded by rain than in the low country. In the early part of the year 
there appears to be a retardation of from six weeks to two months in the 
flowering of species upon the Micklefell ridge as compared with the Cen- 
tral valley, and tho retardation of the hay and harvest crops in the Central 
valley as compared with the South of England is about three weeks. 

Temperature of Springs and of the Sea. In our climate it would seem 
that at a depth of 3 feet in the ground the annual range of temperature sinks 
to from 15 to 20 degrees, the periods of maxima and minima not differing 
greatly from what they are at the surface ; that at 6 feet there is a range 
of from 10 to 15 degrees and that the times of the maxima and minima

Gl 



are retarded : that at 24 feet below the surface the range is not more 
than 3 J, the periods of maxima and minima being as compared with 
the surface nearly reversed : and that at from 50 to 100 feet below the 
surface the temperature scarcely varies. According to the observations 
of Mr. Abbey at Horton Hall near Bradford in 18G0 the temperature of 
ground at one foot below the surface was upon the mean of the year one 
degree and a half above that of the air in the shade at four feet from the 
ground, the difference between the means of the extreme months being 
less in the ground than in the air by 5,8 and the extremes of cold and heat 
being both cut off. The ground was lower than the air in March, May, 
June and July, higher during the rest of the year. Some of the deepest 
springs which we have in North Yorkshire do not appear to vary at all. 
The Cayton Bay spring, which supplies Scarbro' with water and which 
issues from the calcareous Oolitic cliffs at a height of 75 feet above high- 
water mark is stated by Dr. Cooke to be always at 49 degrees. A copious 
spring between Scawton and Ricvaulx, the waters of which like those of 
the other, sink through the calcareous beds of the Middle Oolite to gush 
out at tho surface of the Oxford Clay, I have tested at various times both 
in Summer and Winter and always found to be about 48 degrees. A 
third spring, situated under similar geological circumstances in a deep 
shaded ravine immediately beneath the village of Scawton I have found 
at 48 both in the Spring and Summer. But probably these invariable or 
nearly invariable springs are confined to tho limestone. Of those which 
vary February appears to be the month of the minimum and either August 
or September that of the maximum temperature, the difference between 
the two varying mainly according to the depth below the surface from 
which the water comes. At Gormire a spring gushing out of a steqp 
bank composed of the arenaceous rocks of the Lower Oolite with an east- 
ern exposure and situated at an elevation of about 150 yards above the 
sea-level was tested month by month during the first half of 1857 and 
found to be 44, 43, 43|, 43Â£, 48 and 53Â£. The following table gives tho 
march from February to September of three comparitivcly shallow springs 
situated at an elevation above the sea-level of about 50 yards which issuo 
from clayey diluvium over lias on tho east bank of Cod Beck between tho 
Locks Bridge and the Worlds End Bridge near Thirsk, the range of varia- 
tion here being probably an extreme one.

This gives us for the sea an annual mean of 48,4. We sec that here 
the difference between the extreme months is about the same as that of 
the Think springs and lower than that of the monthly means of the air 
by about 10 degrees, the extreme cold of the Winter and the extreme heat 
of the Summer being both cut off, as is the case to a lesser extent with 
the air at the sca-sido as compared with what it is at an inland station. 
It will be seen that the sea is conspicuously warmer than the air in 
Winter, conspicuously coidci in Slimmer.

It will be seen that the distribution of the fall over the different seasons 
of the year is very irregular. Out of the seven northern stations the least 
rainy month in five cases is February, in one March and in one May ; the 
most rainy in three cases October, in two September, in one July and in 
one August. At Greenwich the "Winter and Spring have about the samu 
amount of rain ; the Autumn has about half as much more and the Sum- 
mer a little less than the Autumn. At the Northern stations the Autumn 
is the most rainy season of the Year in four, the Summer in three cases, 
but in every case Summer and Autumn taken together have more rain than 
falls during Winter and Spring taken together. The following table gives 
the number of days during which more or less rain has fallen during the 
twenty four hours in four of the stations upon an average of years varying 
in number from five to twelve.

So that wo sec that both the smallest quantity of rain falls and upon the 
fewest days upon the east coast. In the Central vale the rainfall does not 
differ notably from what is usual in the eastern counties of England apart 
from the lulls. Amongst the eastern moorlands there is doubtless an ad- 
vance upon this, but to what extent I am unable to say ; and as we leavo 
the low country to penetrate the moorlands of the west both the quantity 
of rain and the number of days upon which it falls augment conspicuously 
and amongst the loftier mountains which lie near the county boundary the 
quantity of rain wliich falls is no doubt considerably higher than is repre- 
sented by the highest figures which we have given. The rain-clouds 
which gather round the peaks frequently do not reach the dales and an 
excursionist from the towns at the head of the western dales often gets 
thoroughly wetted during a climb amongst the hills and on returning to 
the starting point finds that little or no rain has fallen theje. 

Tlw Mean Humidity of the Atmosphere. By calling in the aid of the 
wet and dry bulb thermometer we arc enabled to obtain a far more precise 
idea of the real humidity of the atmosphere than we can get by consider- 
ing the rainfall alone. The following tiiblc gives, for four of the stations 
of wliich the rainfall has been already stated, the average humidity of the 
atmosphere month by month, taking saturation at 100, and in a fifth 
column that of Greenwich is oppended.

This table shews how little there is of any definite relation between 
rainfall and mean atmospheric humidity. Scarbro' with its 21^ inches of 
rain is upon a par as regards dampness of air with Allenheads, where the 
rainfall is more than double. At Greenwich, which is the only station 
for which the observations extend over a considerable number of years, 
there is a regular increase in humidity from June to November, a regular 
decrease from January to June. The difference nt Scarbro* between the 
extreme months of the year is only 9 whilst at Greenwich it is 16 and 
at Allenheads 18. And we see also how humid is even our low country, 
a circumstance no doubt to be attributed mainly to its nearness to the 
two ranges of hills, and a peculiarity which must exert an important 
influence both upon health and vegetation. 

Winds. The following table, after Professor Phillips, gives the average 
number during each of the four quarters of the year of the different winds 
as observed at York from 1800 to 1809, the average temperature of each 
from 120 observations of each during each month of the year at York, at 8 
a.m., and the average dampness of each as observed by the oat-beard hygro- 
meter at Brandsby.

The principal anomaly or local peculiarity here is tho position in the 
lists as regards temperature of tho North-west wind and as regards 
humidity of tho South-west and North-cast ; and these wo must explain 
by remembering the position of the low country with regard to the 
hill-masses. The North-west wind is normally warmer than the North- 
east, but with us it blows from a cold mountainous region and often 
brings severe weather. The average temperature of the East wind is 
raised so high by the height which it reaches in Summer, but in Winter 
it is one of the coldest of the winds. The North-east is usually known 
as a keen dry wind, but with us it is thrown up by beating ngainst the

of hills, and thus losing heat and density, often discharges 
its moisture in the shape of sleet ; and the normally damp South-west on 
the contrary has much of its moisture absorbed by the Pennine chain 
before it reaches us.

CHAPTER III. 

LITHOLOGT. 

])y*geogenou9 and eugeogenou* fit rata. As may be gathered from what 
has been stated in the chapter devoted to Geology, the rocks of the different 
periods in North Yorkshire are, for each as a whole, characterised by well 
marked lithological peculiarities ; and from this circumstance arises the 
fact that the tracts which they respectively underlie are found to possess 
tangibly marked physico-geographical peculiarities. To the question of 
the differences in mechanical constitution which the various strata present 
and the results which may be traced as springing from such differences 
as their primary cause it will therefore be needful to devote a few pages 
before proceeding further. 

Two principal types of rock in respect of mechanical constitution may 
be traced. Following the nomenclature of the elaborate treatise upon 
this subject of M. Thurmann* I propose to call them eugeogenous (plenti- 
ful-detritus-bearing) and dgsgeogenous (sparing-detritus-yielding), these 
terms being better calculated than any which have been previously em- 
ployed which I can call to mind to keep prominently in view what is 
essential to be remembered. 

The essential differences between the rocks of the two kinds are mainly 
. in respect of their hardness, their power of absorbing and retaining mois- 
ture in small masses, their permeability when we consider them as form- 
ing extensive strata, and the differences in their power of yielding detritus 
which result from these characteristics. If we arrange the different kinds

of rock in a scale according to their hardness and permeability, beginning 
with those which possess the smallest capacity for absorption and offer the 
greatest resistance to abrading influences, we shall have to place in the 
first rank the compact Limestones, Granites and Basalts ; after them the 
compact Slaty rocks and Limestones like the Coralline Oolite and Calcare- 
ous Gritstone ; then must follow some of the metamorphosed igneous rocks 
and the harder kinds of compact sandstone like the Brimham Grit and 
Kelloways band ; then many of the Freestones, Flagstones and Chalks : 
and last of all and most absorbent of all are most of the rocks in which 

* 

the argillaceous element is predominant, the Plates and Clays of the Car- 
boniferous beds, tho Shales and Clays of the Trias and the Lias, the 
Oxford Clays and Kimmeridge Clays of the Oolite. As regards permeabili- 
ty when bedded in extensive strata it is almost always tho Limestones 
which are the most conspicuously traversed by fissures and breaks, and the 
softer argillaceous rocks which are the most compact, the sandstones and 
harder siliceo-aluminous beds occupying an intermediate position. The 
power which the different kinds of rock have of yielding detritus depends 
upon their position in the 6cale which has been indicated, and especially 
when they form hill masses and are permeable upon a grand scale the soils 
which cover the dysgeogenous rocks are comparatively dry, whilst those 
which cover the eugeogenous rocks are comparatively humid. 

We see that difference in respect of the characteristics which have just 
been noticed does not by any means run precisely parallel with difference in 
chemical composition. Calcareous rocks are not always dysgeogenous nor 
arenaceous and argillaceous rocks always eugeogenous, though such is most 
frequently the case. We must put the Limestones of the Carboniferous, 
Permian and Oolitic periods upon one side and place Basalt along with 
them : and on the other side Clays like those of the Lias and New Red 
Sandstone, and Sandstones like those of the Trias, the Millstone Grit and 
the Lower Oolite, Chalk with the Slates and most of the Granitic rocks 
occupying an intermediate position. And a characteristic feature of our 
field of study and that which constitutes its special interest from the point 
of view which we are now occupying, is, that in it the strata of the differ- 
ent periods not only underlie well defined districts, but that they are com- 
posed either of rocks of well marked eugeogenous type or of well marked 
dysgeogenous type, or of bands of the two kinds mixed up together in the 
deposits of one period : and that, as we have already seen, rocks of interme- 
diate lithological constitution, as occupying large tracts of surface, are 
entirely absent.

Their distribution throughout North Yorkshire. The following tabid 
then, is a repetition, except that the thickness of the beds is omitted, of 
that which was given at the end of the chapter on Geology, each series

So that we have on the west bands of hard dry rock with thick euge- 
ogenous interpolations between them forming the edges of most of the dales 
and ascending in some places to the loftier mountain summits, but more 
usually these summits and the higher surfaces of the moorlands, like their 
slope in the direction of the central valley, are formed of eugeogenous mate- 
rials. Next follows a narrow strip of dysgeogenous and a broad area of 
eugeogenous lowland country, and on the east are two extensive tracts of 
moorland with contrasting lithological characters, both of which rise into 
the Middle zone, and last of all we have on the south of them a eugeogen- 
ous valley, the proportion of eugeogenous surface to that of dysgeogenous 
being for North Yorkshire as a whole folly three to one. 

Their influence upon the configuration of the dales and hill-masses. The 
results of these lithological differences are to be found, not only in the 
modification which they produce upon the general contour of the surface 
and the influence which they exercise in detenoining the shape of the 
dales and the configuration of the hill masses, but they exercise also an 
influence which is by no means unimportant upon the topography of the 
vegetation. "We will take the first question first and examine their influ- 
ence upon a large scale and then treat the matter in its botanico-gcograph- 
ical bearings. 

The different beds and bands of rock have all since the period of their 
original deposition been subjected to the influence of energetic watery

action- The glacial inundation must have reached a height of at least 
1000 feet above the present sea-level and that is only one flood amongst 
many. In almost all the dales the strata upon the opposite sides of the 
dale correspond to each other precisely. This correspondence is disturbed 
by faults in Teesdale, Lunedale and Arkendale and by smaller dislocations 
elsewhere, but as a rule our dales are dales of denudation. In Wenaley- 
dale we have the same bands of limestone in the fells upon both sides of 
the hollow with an excavation between them which often reaches a mile 
in width and a thousand feet in depth. In the dales of the Esk and 
Derwent districts the sandstones of the Lower Oolite may usually be seen 
above the shales of the Upper Lias upon both sides at an equal elevation 
above the stream. And we find that the general contour of the surface 
and configuration of the dales and coast is very much to be explained by 
the fact that the strata of different degrees of hardness have been unequal- 
ly worn away. * 

Both upon the east and in the west in 'the hill country two different 
types of scenery may be traced. The flat table lands of tho limestone 
hills contrast conspicuously with the irregular undulations of the sandstone 
hills : the steep precipitous calcareous scars not less so with the irregular 
" edges " of freestone and gritstone. . The sandstone hills are usually 
intersected by branching rivulets which flow from their upper levels 
gradually down their slopes into the low country : the limestone hills have 
neither streams nor natural pools upon their surfaces, but the glens slope 
suddenly and the water sinks through the calcareous beds to gush out in 
large volume when it reaches some less permeable stratum. The sand- 
stone dales are open and irregular with gradual slopes and undulated em- 
bankments : the limestone dales are steep and narrow with sudden slopes 
and embankments rising up like a wall upon each side to shut them in. 

It is in the east that the characteristic features of the hills of the two 
types are seen most readily. We have there two ranges of hills, one of 
which is fully 400 and the other 200 square miles in area, which through- 
out their extent are composed, the northern range of well marked eugeo- 
genous and the southern mass of well marked dysgeogenous materials : 
and most of the main branches of the Derwent rise amongst the sandstone 
hills and break through the limestone range before they enter into the low 
country. As they pass from one range to the other the change is so 
striking that it cannot fail to arrest the attention of the most casual obser- 
ver. The difference in outline of the two kinds of hill may be well seen 
by looking up Brandsdale or Farndale from the vale of Pickering. We

have then immediately in front the flat plateaux and steep narrow dales 
of the calcareous range with its steep escarpment towards the north sweep- 
ing far away eastward and westward, and beyond rise the irregularly 
undulated masses of the heathery arenaceous moors with the high anticli- 
nal ridgo to bound the horizon. In the upper part of the dales the woods 
are scattered irregularly over their slopes and are more frequently to be 
found along the margins of the streams than anywhere else, but in their 
lower portion the steep calcareous embankments are usually covered 
thickly with wood from the edge of the plateau all the way down the 
slope and the streamside at the bottom of the dale left free. The Bran 
and the Dove are both partly swallowed up by the limestone, the former 
in Kirkdale, the latter near Kirby-moorside, and of springs where a large 
volume of water flows out from the limestone we have instances at the 
Keld heads near Pickering, where the Costa has its source, and in the 
springs of invariable temperature respecting which we have spoken in the 
chapter on Climate. 

In the main dales of tho west, especially in the upper parts of Swale- 
dale and Wenslcydale, it will be remembered that the hill slopes are 
composed of the Yoredale series of strata, and that this consists of six 
parallel bands of limestone with thick interpolations of cugeogenous rock. 
" "Where it exists complete " writes Professor Phillips, " as at the head of 
"Wcnsleydale the Yoredale scries admits of being exactly characterised 
in a drawing, so that its parts may be again recognized in other situations. 
For example, take the profile of a mountain whose top is capped with 
Millstone Grit and whose base rests upon the Lower Scar Limestone, its 
whole slope being formed of Yoredale rocks 800 to 1000 feet thick and 
the scries complete. The profile will present the following leading fea- 
tures. At the top of the series under a round or angular top of Millstone 
Grit and perhaps a small edge of Chert or Little Limestone the Main or 
Twelve fathom Limestone will project into a bold perpendicular scar : 
below it will be a little concave or flat slope terminated by a second and 
less conspicuous projection of the thinner Underset Limestone : a long 
slope succeeds, simple or slightly varied with rising undulations corres- 
ponding to the hard gritstones interstratified with shales : this ends above 
a single or double scar of the Middle Limestone, which is very conspicu- 
ous whero thick, as in Addleburgh and renhill, but easily lost by tho 
detritus of the superior rocks where it is thin, as above Hawes : below 
this there is another slope to the Simonside limestone which forms a smooth 
terrace : another steep elope to the Hardraw Limestone, which runs for

miles along both sides of Wen&leydale in a remarkable terrace, occasionally 
wooded, always very abrupt and rocky at the edge, and based upon a 
steep slope of plates leading to the broad floors of the Lower Scar Lime- 
stone." In its general lithological characters the Millstone Grit much 
resembles the Lower Oolite and its peaks and ridges rise above the Main 
Limestone scars with usually the same rotundity and undulation of slope 
and the same comparative humidity of surface which have just been 
mentioned as characteristic of the northern range of moorlands situated on 
the east of the Central Yalley. 

There is in 4 ' Rokeby," the description of a glen of each kind : the gill 
where the Greta below Mortham flows beneath scars of Main Limestone 
to pour its waters into the Tees ; and the neighbouring hollow of Thors- 
gill with its gradual arenaceous slopes. Here we have not only the 
physico-geographical facts, but also the ideas and imaginations thereby 
suggested.

Their influence upon the topography of the vegetation. The rocks of the 
different kinds furnish to unite with vegetable humus to make the soils 
above them a detritus more or less abundant in proportion to their permea- 
bility, sometimes clayey, sometimes sandy, sometimes partaking of the two 
natures combined : and in the low country bands of diluvial clay and sand 
and gravel, the contributions from all the different beds mixed up together, 
usually overspread the subjacent rock to a considerable depth. Upon the 
permeability on a grand scale of its subjacent strata and the proportion in 
which the different kinds of detritus enter into the composition of its 
subsoils the natural fertility of any particular tract of country and the 
sort of stations which it furnishes for wild plants to grow in, to a consid- 
erable extent depends. The difference between the different kinds of soil 
in their power of absorbing and retaining moisture is very great. If we 
take a quantity of dry sand and put it into a bag and pour water upon it, 
we shall find that it will not absorb more than a quarter of its own weight 
of the water : but vegetable loam will absorb 40 or 50 per cent of its own 
weight, and pure dry argillaceous clay as much as 60 or 70 per cent. A 
predominance of clayey detritus in a soil gives to it consistency, tenacity, 
impermeability ; a predominance of sandy detritus powderyness, mobility 
and divisibility. Argillaceous soils are comparitively humid and cold and 
in dry weather become hardened and form a crust upon their surfaces.

Arenaceous soils offer the opposite advantages and disadvantages ; they are 
often light and sterile and in dry weather soon become at their surfaces 
arid and parched. 

In the chapter upon Climate we have seen how the ripening of the hay 
crop and harvest in the low country is in an ordinary season accelerated 
before the average on the light sandy soils, retarded behind the average 
on the humid clayey soils : and how the difference between heavier soils and 
a somewhat more northern exposure and lighter soils and a more sheltered 
situation makes at equal altitudes between different parts of our field of 
study the difference between the Vine, the Fig and the Spanish Chesnut 
yielding or not yielding eatable fruit. In I stria M. Tommasini appraises 
the superiority of the light soils underlaid by limestone over the heavy 
soils underlaid by argillaceous rock at 2 degrees of Reaumur's thermome- 
ter, even although the former are somewhat hilly and also more northern 
in position. We have seen also what is the difference in the yield of the 
Cereal crops between the argillaceous soils of Cleveland and the compari- 
tively porous soils of the Central Valley, and with regard to wild plants 
we find that there is for them upon the well marked argillaceous soils a 
comparatively restricted range of station, and that in tracts of country under- 
laid by rock of this character and overlaid by detritus in which the argil- 
laceous element preponderates the wild plants which occur are mostly such 
as are widely distributed throughout Britain and ascend to high latitudes 
and altitudes : whilst not unfrequently in sandy soils we have pascual 
and glareal species which are less abundant and less boreal in their dis- 
tribution. Under equal climates and at equal elevations, we may say 
safely that an argillaceous soil has a more humid and a more boreal vege- 
tation : an arenaceous soil, unless overspread by heath, a flora more 
varied and more southern. As determining differences between the floras 
of limited tracts the results of this difference may be traced, but through- 
out the various parts of our low country the different kinds of soil are so 
much mixed up together that as regards its application to the topography 
of our vegetation this is all the result that can fairly be attributed to it 
with clearness. 

The most prominent contrasts concerning topography of vegetation of 
which we have to speak are in the first place the restriction of a category 
of specially Xerophilous or dry-loving species to the dysgeogenous soils in 
such a way that this restriction is one of the most prominent features of 
their role of distribution : and in the second place as regards the modifi- 
cation which the influence of the subjacent rock exercises upon the altitu-

dinal range of certain Bpeciea. Though to a certain extent it involves the 
repetition of what has been already dwelt upon, I will quote from my 
note book, in order to connect together more clearly what follows with 
what has been stated already, two extracts which give an account of ex- 
cursions made to hills of the two lithological types and which enumerate 
also the commoner or more conspicuous plants which the two hill-surfaces 
and their slopes produce. 

"The Harriot Air near Mevaulr, and Ouldray OiU. A plateau with the 
beds of limestone rock not far from the surface, covered with elastic wiry 
grassy turf, the constituent elements of which are the common plants of 
pastures, but scattered over with Carlina and Bee orchis, and with Thyme 
and Rock-Rose and Poterium Sanguisorba in knolls upon its undulations, 
and a few scraggy bushes of hawthorn and a few blocks of hard massive 
calcareous gritstone scattered over its slope in the direction of the main 
dale. 

The plateau is about 600 feet in elevation above the sea-level, and there 
are two or three farm houses upon it, with Sycamore and Scotch Fir 
planted to shelter them from the moorland breezes, and there are fields of 
Oats and Rape and forage, bounded some of them by hedges of Whitethorn 
and Blackthorn, and some of them by walls the art of building which must 
certainly require a special apprenticeship, for the blocks, which are this 
same compact calcareous gritstone, are of all kinds of sizes and of all kinds 
of shapes except absolutely round, and yet no cement or mortar is employed. 
The prominent mosses of the walls are Leskea sericea and Tortula ruralis, 
the prominent lichens Parmelia calcarea and murorum, Collema nigrum, 
Biatora rupestris and the pitted LecideÂ® and Verrucariae. Upon the pla- 
teau there are no natural streams or ponds, nothing but artificial specimens 
of the latter, glaringly artificial in their primness of contour, the work 
perhaps of the professional u artificial pond-maker " whose sign is to be 
seen at Helmsley. 

The main gill is approached in this direction down a narrow gradually- 
sloping gorge, dark with overshadowing woods, with mainly, now that the 
Primroses and Wood Anemones have gone, a thick undergrowth of the 
Geums and Allium ursinum, and with abundance of the tall succulent 
branching stems and lurid digitated leaves of Helleborus viridis and here 
and there bushes of Actaea spicata scattered amongst it, the sombre green- 
ness pleasantly relieved by Lychnis and Stellaria, by patches of fresh bright 
blue which Myosotis sylvatica and the Hyacinth furnish, and the bright 
golden globes of a colony of Trollius which has established itself at the 
bottom of the wood.

The principal gill is one of a thoroughly calcareous 'stamp, such an one 
as these hills of the Middle Oolite abound in. The steeply sloping bank 
upon the north-west is not less than 800 or 400 feet in height and is 
covered thickly with aboriginal wood, the Oak the principal tree, But far 
more of Hazel than anything else, Ash, Hawthorn, Wych Elm, Salix 
Caprea, Elder, Maple, Honey suckle, Roses and Brambles. The soil over 
the subjacent rock is thin and gravelly. There is a glorious undergrowth 
of Rubus saxatilia beneath the bushes, plenty to yield a largo basket-ful of 
Rock Brambles at the fruiting timo, and abundance of Origanum vulgare 
and wiry grass and sedge, (Brachypodium sylvaticum, Bromus asper, Meli- 
ca nutans, M uniflora, Carex digitata, C. glauca, C. sylvatica,) and in lesser 
quantity Aquilegia and ActÂ®a, Viola hirta, Hypericum hirsutum and 
montanum. Upon the opposite side of the gill the soil is damper and 
more loamy and Lathrea and Neottia may be found, upon the stones abun- 
dance of Hypnum murale, and upon the lower edge of the wood Polypodi- 
mn Drvonteris and Bilberrv. Blcchnum boreale and Calluna. 

There is no stream till we reach the surface of the Oxford Clay, 400 feet 
below the top of the plateau, and then a bright clear little brook gushes 
out and soon gathers to a rivulet of tolerable size, fed by springs the out- 
pouring of which trickles through oozy plashes rich with bright green and 
purple moss, (notably Hypnum condensatum and also Bryum ventricosum, 
H. cuspidatum, H. revolvens, H. nitens, Milium affine and Bartramia cal- 
carea,) and diversified by swamp Carices (C. fulva, C. flava, C. dioica, 
C. pulicaris, C stellulata) Eriophorum latifolium, Primula farinosa, Lych- 
nis Flos-cuculi, Caltha and Epipactis palustris. In one place there is a 
swampy thicket filled with bushes of Salix Andersoniana. At the lower 
part of the gill there is a space of pasture land on both sides of the stream 
and some of the woods upon its slope consist of planted Conifene. It is 
altogether about three miles in length and opens out at the town of Helms- 
ley. " 

"Rumbald't Moor and the Cow and Calf Rocks over llkley. Between the 
two dales (Wharfedale and Airedale) there is a ridge of hill which is here 
some three or four miles across, which rises at the centre of the ridge to a 
height of 1300 feet, and over the edge of the dales is from 900 to 1000 
above the sea-level, 600 to 700 feet above the main streams. Everywhere 
from the watershed to the dale edges sweeps a continuous surface of undu- 
lated turfy heatherland, over the sandstone a thinner or thicker covering 
of soft rich brown peat and everywhere that same so well known gregari- 
ous heatherland vegetation. Far away it sweeps, miles to eastward along

where the ridge grows lower and narrower, and the dales open out, and 
the towns grow larger and busier and smokier, far away to westward 
where the dales grow narrower and steeper, and the ridges higher and the 
summits rise, hundreds and hundreds of square miles in area over the 
higher ground, one broad surface of treeless, houseless, uncultivated moor. 
Of the Ericaceous shrubs Calluna vulgaris is much the most abundant and 
there are also Erica cinerea and Tetralix, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccini- 
um Myrtillus, thick- swelling in the hollows and over the turfy undulations, 
stunted and rough where the ground is drier and the rock nearer the sur- 
face. In the drier places J uncus squarrosus, Galium saxatile, Nardus 
stricta and Aira flexuosa are the most prominent plants and of the ferns 
Blechnum bore ale and the Common Brake. Amongst the heather Hyp- 
num splendcns is the commonest moss and of the Lichens Cetraria aculea- 
ta and Cladonia rangiferina and coccifera and in the spaces between the 
tufts are Polytrichum commune and Bicranum scoparium. In the swamps 
grow Scirpus caespitosus, Eriophorum vaginatum and sometimes Drosera 
rotundifolia and Narthecium, and in pools and peaty rills abundance of 
Hypnum fluitans, Leucobryum glaucum and various species of Sphagnum. 
Where the turf has been bared away for fuel arc Polytrichum piliferum 
and juniperinum and wide spreading patches of Ceratodon purpureas. 
Vaccinium Vitis-idaoa is not plentiful here and Y. Oxycoccus I know in 
this neighbourhood in one swamp only, where Corydalis claviculata grows 
upon the rock below. 

The crest of the hill is marked by an irregular line of scar-like "edges" 
of gritstone, huge boulders of which are piled about in picturesque con- 
fusion immediately beneath the edge and scattered more sparingly far 
down below towards the bottom of the slope : and the walls along the hill 
aide and over the moor-top are built of loosely-piled blocks of this same 
gritstone, which is a sandstone of coarse grain and moderate firmness of 
texture, with large crystals of quartz thickly imbedded amongst it. As 
in all the gritstones the blocks are rough and unshapely and are much 
pitted and channelled by the influence of time and weather. There are 
numerous lichens upon the rocks and walls, Endocarpon smaragdulum, 
Biatora polytropa, thin-crusted black-fruited Lecidea?, Parmelia saxatilis, 
physodes and other foliaceous species, fringe-like tufts of E verm a jubata 
and furfuracea : and in the shaded sandy ground beneath the rocks and in 
the trenches by the wall sides abundance of Dicranum heteromallum and 
J ungermannia albicans. The peaty rills gradually converge to the head 
of a little grassy gill, and the streamlet which they form, not as in the

limestone sinking through the surface of the hill to appear as a full grown 
rivulet at the foot of its slope, makes its way down the hill-side with 
much animation, at first forcing a road down a narrow channel where it 
is almost hidden by overhanging grasses and rushes, and gathering as it 
goes, fed by numerous tiny watercourses edged by Stellaria uliginosa and 
Montia fontana, now leaping with foam and bubbles over a moss-fringed 
rock that would interpose to bar its progress and ever and anon spreading 
out into a more open channel and rippling noisily over the scattered 
pebbles. The principal mosses of the stream are Racomitrium aciculare, 
Hypnum flagellare and a form of Hypnum palustre : and the swamps upon 
the hillsides yield abundance of Sphagna, Bartramia fontana, Bryum ven- 
tricosum, Aulacomnion palustre, Hypnum fluitans, cuspidatum and stra- 
mineum : and of the less frequent species the bogs yield Hypnum exannu- 
latum and Mnium subglobosum and the walls and rocks Dicranum fuscescens 
Weissia cirrhata and Ptychomitrium polyphyllum. The natural woods of 
the hillside are principally Oak, with more Rowan and Birch, and less 
Hazel and Ash than in the limestone dales, with more of swamp (with 
Chrysosplenium, Caltha, Cardamine sylvatica, Crepis paludosa, Equisetum 
Telmatcia, Spiraea Ulraaria,) and less of underwood and entirely without 
the characteristically Xerophilous species." 

Amongst the higher moorlands of the west there is a difference in vege- 
tation which is conspicuously connected with the difference between the 
hills of the two types in respect of humidity of surface. Into the Upper 
zone three of the limestone hills ascend, Micklefell, Camfell, and Widdale 
fell : and within its limits the surfaces of these are covered in some places 
with a short grassy turf which yields several of the species which are 
common in grassy places throughout the low country, and in the crevices 
of the limestone rock a few ferns and other shade-loving plants occur, and 
a few of the characteristically Montane species are also to be met with, 
as for instance Draba incana, Viola lutea, Saxifraga hypnoides and Arena- 
ria verna. To those portions of these three hills where the limestone rock 
is at or near the surface fully two-thirds of the Flowering Plants and 
Ferns which ascend into the Upper zone are restricted. Which these 
species are can be ascertained so readily by a glance through the list in the 
Botanical portion of these notes that it does not appear needful to recapit- 
ulate them here. But the far more numerous arenaceous peaks and ridges 
which ascend into the Upper zone present everywhere what a botanist on 
the outlook for rarities is apt to consider a monotonous repetition of the 
common gregarious plants of a swampy heatherland, so that the following

Throughout the moorlands both upon the east and west of the Central 
Valley this swamp-heatherland vegetation attains its greatest perfection 
and covers without intermission the widest tracts of surface over the Mill- 
stone Grit and the Lower Oolite : whilst the dysgeogenous hills are more 
grassy and in the two upper zones it is far more usually amongst the scars 
of the limestone and the short grassy turf which the limestones immediate- 
ly underlie that the ascending stations of the common pascual, pratal, 
mural and glareal plants of the low country are to be found. A glance at 
the botanical list will shew how very frequently the " Main Limestone " 
and the "Hambleton plateau" are mentioned in connection with the as- 
cending limits of species. And on the other hand, the heatherlands of the 
Central Valley are all based upon sandstone, and with them Drosera angli- 
ca, Vaccinium Oxycoccus, Listers cordata, Lycopodium Selago, L. selagi- 
noides and several of the Montane mosses descend to their lowest stations, 
where they meet and mingle with such species as Gentiana Pneumonanthe, 
Mentha Pulegium, Centunculus minimus, Spergularia rubra, Cerastium 
semidecandrum, Hypericum elodes, Kadiola Millegrana, Ornithopus pcr- 
pusillus and Lycopodium inundatum. 

It is in the tract of the Middle Oolite that the characteristically Xero- 
philous species have their head quarters. The following species are the 
most typical representatives of this category and are either absolutely or 
very nearly restricted in North Yorkshire to the scars and dry banks of 
the Middle Oolite, the Magnesian Limestone and the Mountain Limestone, 
avoiding altogether or growing but very sparingly in the eugeogenous 
three-fourths of the area of the Riding.

Of these forty species, thirteen are restricted to the "West of the Central 
Valley and three to the East, but the remaining twenty-four grow both 
upon the east and the west of it. Of the distribution of the latter that of 
Aquilegia vulgaris will afford a fair average illustration. 

So far as known to me the Wild Columbine grows in North Yorkshire 
as follows, excluding from consideration two or three stations where it is 
plainly a 'garden escape. Amongst the western hills in Swaledale in 
woods at the Round Howe and on the north side of the river near Apple- 
garth, and in the Yore district in Fossdale Woods, in all these three cases 
amongst the scars of the Yoredale limestone ; and also in Wensleydale by 
the Yore side about the Ayagarth rapids upon the Lower Scar Limestone. 
From the tract underlaid by the Millstone grit series it is altogether ab- 
sent. Where the Magnesian Limestone comes to the surface it grows in 
woods by the Wharfe side at Thorp Arch. It overleaps altogether the 
New Red Sandstone of the Central Valley and is absent also from the 
tracts underlaid by the Lias and the Inferior OoHte. Amongst the woods 
of the calcareous embankments of the hills of the Middle Oolite it grows 
plentifully in Yowlasdale, Beck dale and several other places about Helms- 
ley and Hawnby and Pickering, in the Howardian tract in several stations 
and in the dale of the Derwent near Hackness. from the Vale of Pick- 
ering it is altogether absent.

So that we have the plant growing more or less abundantly in all the 
tracts (see table at page 70) which are underlaid by the dysgeogenous 
beds, but entirely absent from the wide intermediate areas underlaid by 
the more porous and more humid strata. It follows the limestone from 
east to west through the irregularities of its dispersion and is entirely 
restricted to that fourth portion of the area of North Yorkshire to which 
the limestone is restricted. How closely the distribution of many of these 
Xerophilous species corresponds with that of AquUegia a glance at what 
is said respecting them in the botanical portion of these notes will shew.

In these two lists aboriginally native species only have been included 
and together they take in about one in thirteen of our indigenous flower- 
ing plants and ferns. When these species pass beyond the limits of the 
dysgeogenous fourth of North Yorkshire they always grow over dry sandy 
rock or dry sandy or gravelly detritus, avoiding the clayey and rich heavy 
soils. Next to the immediate neighbourhood of compact calcareous rock 
they evidently prefer stations where sand so loosely bound together that 
water sinks readily through it predominates, a circumstance which indicates 
pretty conclusively that it is the dryness of the limestones rather than their 
chemical composition which is the chief source of attraction. Several of 
them are to be met with upon the coast sand-hills in the neighbourhood 
of Redcar : a few of them are found in the vicinity of the basaltic dike in

Cleveland : more of them amongst the subcalcareous portions of the Infe- 
rior Oolite, as at Boltby and especially where in the Howardian tract the 
calcareous character of the interposed band is most clearly marked. Some 
of the commonest of the Subxerophilous species are scattered at intervals 
over the sandier parts of tho Central Valley and may be found in such 
stations as the Ouse side along the Clifton ings, the banks of the Swale at 
Topcliffe, of the Tees between Stapleton and Croft and the gravelly soils 
of the neighbourhood of Bedale and Kirklington. 

M. Thurmann gives for the portion of Central Europe which includes 
the Vosges and the Jura both a list of the indigenous plants and an ac- 
count of their distribution with regard to the subjacent rocks. Comparing 
the British flora as a whole with that of this region or indeed with that of 
any other part of the interior of Central or Southern Europe we see even 
by glancing over the mere list of names how conspicuously with us the 
damp-loving element predominates. When a British and Foreign Cybele 
is written, a work giving an account of the distribution of British plants 
through foreign countries and of the relation of our indigenous flora to 
that of Europe as a whole, this is one of the points which its author will 
have to explain to us and illustrate for us in detail- Out of 50 species 
which M. Thurmann gives as being within his limits the commonest 
plants which are characteristic of dysgcogenous tracts we have in North 
Yorkshire as indigenous plants eight species only : out of the fifty species 
which ho names as the commonest plants which are characteristic of the 
eugeogenous tracts within his limits we have in North Yorkshire thirty- 
one species. 

With us several of the most characteristically paludal plants which are 
common in the neighbourhood of York and Thirsk are altogether confined 
to the vales and nowhere ascend into the dales or amongst tho lower- 
levels of the hill-slopes. This is the case with Thalictrum fluvum, 
Nymphaja alba, Nasturtium amphibium, Cerastium aquaticum, Utricula- 
ria vulgaris, Hottonia, Hydrocharis, Sagittaria, Butomus, Potamogeton 
densus, Lemna trisulca and several other species. 

In Central Europe we have, as in North Yorkshire, ranges of hills of 
well-marked contrasting lithological character, the Jura dyBgcogcnous and 
the Vosges and Black Forest eugeogenous. The following arc the thirty- 
one species which inhabit North Yorkshire which are given by M. Thur- 
mann as characteristically eugeogenous. These are plants which ascend 
and are frequent amongst the eugeogenous Vosges and Black Forest but 
are either rare amongst or altogether absent from the dysgcogenous Jura, 
under parallel or nearly parallel conditions of atmospheric climate.

We see that we have in this list most or very nearly all the very species 
which make up the gregarious swamp-heatherland vegetation of which we 
have spoken as covering in our country such wide tracts of surface. These 
species are several of them our commonest North Yorkshire plants and 
ascend amongst the moorlands of both lithological types, the difference for 
them as a class, being certainly, as has been already said, a greater degree 
of frequency and luxuriance in the eugeogenous tracts ; but not such a re- 
striction as we have seen there is in the case of the plants of the dry- 
loving category. 

To sum up then the bearings of the subjacent rocks upon the topography 
of our North Yorkshire vegetation as tested by a comparison of the distri- 
bution of species within our limits and in the country respecting which 
3f . Thurmann treats we may say ; 

1. As compared with the flora of Central Europe the flora of North 
Yorkshire is one of a predominantly damp-loving stamp. 

2. The species which in Central Europe are restricted to dysgeogc- 
nous tracts only occur in North Yorkshire in small number and are there 
restricted lithologically in a similar manner. 

3. The species which in Central Europe are restricted to eugeogenous 
tracts are many of them plants of North Yorkshire also : and under the 
more boreal and more humid climate grow abundantly and cover wide 
areas of surface, without keeping up any clearly-marked role of lithologi- 
cal restriction. 

And this shews us clearly that the nature of the subjacent rock both 
may and does interfere to modify the influence of atmospheric climate 
upon plant-topography, and it points out also in what direction the interfcr-

ence operates. A more porous and more humid soil evidently to some 
extent compensates for a drier climate. In proportion as the climate is 
damper the characteristically dry-loving species are more and more rigidly 
restricted to dry-soiled tracts of country. This is the rule and in botanico- 
gcographical considerations it is evidently worth bearing in mind : but to 
what extent it has operated in determining which species we should have 
and which we should not have either in North Yorkshire or in Britain as 
a whole ; to what extent it has for instance operated in the restriction to 
the area which they occupy in our country of the plants of Mr. "Watson's 
Germanic type of distribution we can but guess vaguely. 

The rich bryological flora of North Yorkshire has its head quarters 
amongst the well irrigated porous-rocked eugeogenous hills and slopes.* 
To these nearly all the characteristically Montane species arc restricted 
and amongst them most of the common mosses ^attain their greatest abun- 
dance and luxuriance. A few species, notably Neckera crispa, Tortula 
tortuosa, and Trichostomum flexicaule arc common everywhere amongst 
the rocks of the dysgeogenous hills and almost entirely absent from the 
eugeogenous tracts. And what has been said of the mosses will apply 
with precision to the Lichens : a good list of species for North Yorkshire 
as a whole, the more northern species confined to, and tho commonest 
sped i s attaining their greatest abundance and luxuriance amongst the 
eugeogenous hills, a few species almost invariably associated with the 
calcareous rocks and almost confined to them. 

The precipices and waterfalls. The unequal waste of different kinds of 
rock is also worthy of attention in its bearing upon two conspicuous fea- 
tures of scenery. First, the precipices. Along a great part of the coast 
line, the cliffs have a compact arenaceous cap over a more or less consider- 
able thickness of mainly argillaceous groundwork. In Whitstoncliff and 
the other scars of the Middle Oolite a mass of compact limestone rests upon 
a base of Oxford Clay, and we havo seen how in the west, clays are inter- 
polated between every band of the Mountain Limestone. The lower part 
of these cliffs wastes away faster than the upper. At first the upper part 
overhangs, becoming all the time gradually loosened by rains and frosts, 
till at last it becomes overbalanced and falls with a tremendous crash, 
strewing the hillside or beach with its broken blocks. Lastly, the water- 

â€¢ Though Tcesdalc is coloured as subdysgeogenous in the Map it can scarcely be considered as such 
without great exception and what is said above does not apply to it. In fact strata of both lithologi- 
cal types are in Teesdalc so much mingled together that it presents the characteristics of both the 
types combined. It has the heatherland and swamps, the irrigated cliffs and gills, the rich bryology 
and lichenology of the eugeogenous hill - and furnishes also upon the limestone and basalt many of the 
characteristically Xerophilous species.

falls. Here again the softer rocks are wasted away and those composed of 
less porous and harder material remain. The numerous falls of Wensley- 
dale are, with only one conspicuous exception, oyer the different hands of 
limestone : in the exceptional case, Milgill force, the edge rock is one of 
the firm gritstones of the Yoredale series. Keasdon force in Swaledale is 
over Limestone : the Caldron Snout, the High force, and the falls of Maze 
Beck and Blea Beck over Basalt. Thomasson's force and the other minor 
falls of Cleveland are over hard edges of Inferior Oolite. And almost inva- 
riably the fall is approached by a steep glen, which, in course of time, the 
stream has excavated, along the sides of which the cap-rock of the fall 
stands out in prominent relief.

DRAINAGE DISTRICTS AND GEOGRAPHICAL CATEGORIES OF PLANTS. 

Drainage districts. The nine districts into which North Yorkshire is 
subdivided in the largest of the four maps which accompany these notes 
are founded upon the river drainage, and are, with exceedingly trifling 
exception, separated from one another either by rivers or lines of water- 
shed, not like wapentakes and parishes, by purely arbitrary and conven- 
tional lines of limitation. These drainage districts are mapped out and 
used to answer a twofold purpose : in connection with physical geography 
to help the mind of those who use this volume to dwell with the promi- 
nence to which its importance from this point of view entitles it upon the 
question of how our Held of study is made up of river-basins and what is 
their extent and configuration : and in connection with botany to aid in 
tracing out and illustrating the topography of its vegetation. It will be 
observed, that with very little exception, the boundaries of North York- 
shire as a whole, are natural boundaries also. In this second part of the 
work it is intended to pass each of these nine drainage districts under 
review, and to speak, as we do so, of its more prominent natural features 
and characteristics, mentioning as we para along the towns and principal 
villages which each includes, its hills and its glens and its waterfalls, and 
also the more noteworthy botanical stations and the plants which they 
produce. 

The following table gives an estimate of the area of each of the districts 
in square miles and classifies them under the vice-counties of the Cybele 
Britannica to which they belong. l

Topography of the plants a* illustrative of facts of physical geography. The 
following aDDcars to be the most natural classification of the plants of 
North Yorkshire in respect of their geographical relations. 

1. The Montane species, those plants which (see the chapter on Cli- 
mate) are either absolutely restricted to the hills and slopes, or are much 
more frequent there than in the rallies. 

2. The Xerophihus species, those plants which (see the chapter on Lith- 
ology) are absolutely restricted to or which are much the commonest in the 
dysgeogenous tracts, growing normally either upon calcareous or basaltic 
rock or dry ground which these immediately underlie, some of them casu- 
ally also in dry sandy places elsewhere. 

3. The Maritime species, those plants which are essentially restricted 
to the neighbourhood of the sea, and three species are also included here 
which are normally maritime but which grow also casually in the interior. 
North Yorkshire is not rich in characteristically maritime plants. The 
coast cliffs yield very few and the only tract where they grow in any 
considerable abundance is the sweep of low marshland which borders the 
sea in the neighbourhood of Middlesbro' and Coatham. 

4. The ffygrophilous species or plants of standing water. These are 
the lacustral or paludal plants of the low country, none having been in-

eluded here which ascend into the Middle zone. Though the total num- 
ber of species which it includes is not conspicuously small, the North 
Yorkshire flora cannot be said to have a large infusion of this element but 
rather the reverse. Many of the species are restricted to two, three or 
four of the drainage districts. 

5. The General ascending species, â€¢*. 9. those which are ascertained to 
occur in all the nine drainage districts. As a general rule the plants 
which range here are both commoner and more abundant where they occur 
not only for North Yorkshire as a whole but also for each of the districts 
taken separately than are those of any of the other categories. 

6. The Scattered ascending species, those which do not range under any 
of the preceding categories and which are ascertained to occur in not less 
than four of the drainage districts. Some of the ericetal and ehade-loving 
plants which are plentiful amongst the hills come in here, and no doubt 
many species which further observation will shew to be really " General." 

7. The Local ascending species., those which do not range under any 
of the preceding categories and are ascertained to occur only in from one 
to three of the drainage districts. 

The following table shews for North Yorkshire as a whole what is the 
absolute number of the Native Flowering Plants and Ferns of each of these 
categories in its flora and the relative proportion which each bears to the

For each of the drainage districts, as we pass them under review, a table 
similar to the above will be given : and it is very interesting to note the 
differences in respect of the way in which their floras are made up which 
the different districts show, and to attempt to trace out how far the differ- 
ence in the composition of the nine floras runs parallel with the difference 
in physical character between the nine districts. Upon comparison of the 
analytical table which is given for each district with what is stated respect- 
ing its physical geography it will be seen that, in point of fact, this par- 
allelism does exist to a remarkable extent. The districts which are com- 
paratively rich in Montane species are those which have the most exten- 
sive and highest tracts of hilly ground : the districts which are compara- 
tively rich in Xerophilous species are those which have a continuous ex- 
tent of dry rock and dry surface soil with tabular hills and steep-banked 
dales : and the Rarer ascending species are highest in number in those 
districts which contain the greatest extent of low-lying level country. 
And it happens almost invariably that when the number of species of any 
of these geographical categories comparatively predominates in a district 
that there most of the species of that category grow in greater abundance 
than they do in a district in which the number of species is small. For 
instance, the number of Montane species which grow in the West Tees 
district is 77 and in the East Swale district is 23. If the total number of 
individual wild plants which grow in the two districts could be counted, 
I have no doubt that the squares of 77 and 23, that is to say 5929 against 
629, would represent more truly the relative proportion of the two in 
respect of the number of individual plants of species of the Montane cate- 
gory which they would be found to yield than would the unmultiplied 
figures. In this way it is intended that the analytical tables and lists of 
rarer plants which are given under each drainage district should be con- 
sidered as data in illustration of its physical geography. About a dozen 
species are given both as Montane and Xerophilous, but except these, each 
is given under a single category only.

NO. 9. THE WEST TEES DI8TBICT. 

This district includes the whole/>f the Yorkshire portion of Upper Tees- 
dale, so well known and so deservedly attractive, not to botanists and 
geologists only, but also to lovers of wild and picturesque scenery. The 
Tees rises upon the slope of Cross-fell, a mountain which towers upwards 
near the edge of the great Pennine escarpment to a height of 2900 feet. 
This is in Cumberland and the streams which flow from the western slope 
of the hill find their way into the Eden, whilst on the east only a narrow 
spur of moorland separates the head waters of the Tees from those of the 
Tyne. At the foot of this hill it is joined by Trout-beck and for five 
miles forms the boundary between Westmoreland and Durham. During 
this part of its course it flows towards the south-east, a gradually aug- 
menting slowly declining stream almost lake-like in its breadth and still- 
ness, with broad undulated tracts of boggy, heathery moorland rising 
steeply from it on either side. This long lake-like expansion is called the 
Weel. From the foot of Troutbeck its course is amongst the Lower 
Mountain Limestone, but not far from the head of the Caldron Snout, at 
a height above the sea-level of 500 yards, it enters the Basalt 

At the Caldron Snout the scene changes. First the water becomes 
ruffled, and then with a rush, the noise of which mingles with the whirr 
of the grouse and the bleating of the mountain sheep far away amidst 
these lonely hills, the stream breaks a gorge through the main mass of the 
Basalt, forming in so doing a series of broken rapids, leap after leap in tu- 
multuous succession, the brown stream dashed by the first leap into foam- 
ing whiteness and rushing from ledge to ledge down a deep winding rocky 
channel, till at last it frees itself from the gorge, and spreads out as a ray 
of light spreads out as it issues from a prism, over a background of sharp-

edged broken basaltic columns. The total depth of the waterfall is two 
hundred feet and nowhere else in England have we so deep a fell upon so 
large a stream. The best point of view for the fall as a whole is the open 
ground a short distance below it upon the "Westmoreland side of the Tees : 
and from the Birkdale sheep-fold the wooden bridge which spans the 
upper part of the waterfall, firm enough in reality, looks frail and danger- 
ous. Above the fall massive angular reddish-brown basaltic crags rise 
steeply to a considerable height and on the Durham side of the stream 
they sweep round the edge of the fell for fully a mile, forming the range 
of broken and precipitous cliffs which is known by the name of Falcon 
Clints. 

From the foot of the Caldron Snout to the sea the Tees forms the north- 
ern boundary of Yorkshire. Its general direction during the earlier part 
of its course is at first east and afterwards south-east. From the Caldron 
Snout to the junction of the Tees and Lune the distance is about ten miles 
and this is what may be considered as the Upper Teesdale portion of our 
drainage district. A rocky river channel ten miles in length with its 
stream declining in level during that distance about 600 feet, and a com- 
pact range of hills also sloping gradually towards the east, the summit of 
the ridge rising to an elevation of from 1000 to 1200 feet above the 
stream, these are the general physical features which it presents. 

The extreme distance between the Tees and the Lune is not more than 
four miles. The rhomboidal mass of moorland which intervenes between 
the two streams culminates in a long ridge of limestone with patches of 
millstone grit over it at both its eastern and western extremities. This is 
Mickle fell,* the highest of the Yorkshire summits, and the top of the 
western patch of gritstone is 2580 feet above the sea-level. The view 
from the summit on a clear day is very extensive. On the north-west 
there is a sudden fall in the direction of Maze beck and across a broad 
hollow may be seen a mass of hills in which the three peaks of Cross fell, 
Dun fell and Scordale head are conspicuous, and the head of a curious 
boat- shaped glen called High-cup Nick, and the tar off peaks of the Lake 
country looming dimly on the edge of the horizon. Towards the north is 
the great Teesdale hollow, with Falcon Clints and the white streak of the 
Caldron Snout immediately in front, and behind them Widdy Bank and 
Harwood fell and the ridge of moorland which separates Teesdale from 

â€¢ The three Craven peaks, Whomsidc, Ingleborough 'and Pennygbent are .better known than 
Micklefell and are often given as the highest Yorkshire hills. The height of Whernside is 2380 feet, 
of Ingleborough 2361 and of Pennyghent 2270.

Weardale, and lower down the dale, the fir plantations of the High Force 
and Winch Bridge, with wall bounded bright green fields and the Duke 
of Cleveland's white- washed farm houses. On the cast the view stretches 
over the woods and slopes and lower hills of the country round about 
Barnard Castle and Richmond and embraces the whole breadth of the 
richly-cultivated vale of York, and as far as the Hambleton Hills. And 
on the south over Lunedale and Balderdale and the Stainmoor depression 
are the innumerable undulated peaks which cluster round the upper part 
of Swaledale and Yoredale, and beyond them the more abrupt outlines of 
Whernside and Ingleborough and Pennyghent. 

At the eastern extremity of the ridge at the summit of the slope towards 
Westmoreland Myosotis alpestris grows. The following are the other 
more noteworthy plants of the summit ridge, growing most of them in the 
hollows and crevices of the limestone.

From the summit ridge in the direction of Maze beck the descent is 
sudden, the distance being about a mile and the difference in elevation not 
less than 1200 feet. This slope is crowned by a small scar of Main 
Limestone, and is intersected by several streamlets, one of which takes 
its rise at the foot of the scar. The rarer plants of this slope are Epilobi- 
um alsinifolium, Sedum villosum, Saxifraga stellaris, Hirculus and 
aizoides, Bryum pallescens, Tetraplodon mnioides and Hypnum sarmento- 
sum. The Maze beck only touches Yorkshire during the lower part of 
its course, and there separates the county from Westmoreland. Till it 
nears the Tees it is a mere moorland stream with a rocky channel, neither 
so broad or so deep but that it may be crossed under ordinary circumstan- 
ces by means of the stones in its bed. During the lower part of its course 
the channel is deeper and the rocks steeper and the stream forms a series 
of small but picturesque rapids as it leaps from ledge to ledge of the 
Basalt. About these falls the following rarer plants grow.

Between the Caldron Snout and the High Force the distance is about 
five miles. During this part of its course the stream flows in a broad 
open channel exceedingly full of loose stones and rounded boulders and 
nowhere do its immediate banks rise to any considerable height. The 
average rate at which it here declines in level is about 75 feet per mile. 
Opposite Falcon Glints the moors of the Yorkshire side are not rocky but 
slope gradually and come closely up to the river, but soon the stream 
takes a sweep towards the north and a broad open space is left between 
the river and the fell, the first farmhouse is reached, and green fields 
begin. This is Upper Cronkley and the hill is called Cronkley Fell. 

From the Mickle fell ridge to the plateau of Cronkley fell proper the 
tourist in descending has first to thread his way amongst a perfect laby- 
rinth of peaty gorges, and then several edges of limestone and gritstone, 
the bands of the lower part of the Yoredale series, are crossed. The Tyne- 
bottom limestone of the White Force is 1730 feet above the sea-level, the 
Cronkley plateau rather higher. The fell stands out boldly towards the 
Tees from the main ridge of hill, so that from the White Force to the 
Caldron Snout the nearest way is across the back of it, and here we have 
those undulated patches of loosely granular metamorphosed Tyne- bottom 
limestone which botanists know so well, patches of white crumbling rock 
and wiry scraggy turf which easily catch the eye amidst the heather and 
peat. The following are the rarer plants of the fell-top, growing nearly 
all of them upon the " sugar limestone."

The stream which flows from the back of Cronkley fell is joined by 
another little Btreamlet from the east, upon the banks of which, a short 
distance from their junction Poly gala austriaca grows, and at the edge of 
the fell falls over a deep scar of Tyne-bottom limestone based upon Basalt. 
This is what is called the White Force. There is a way down from above 
to the centre of the waterfall, and on the west of it a deep perpendicular 
precipice, and upon each side the hills sweep round towards the force so 
as to form a sort of ravine, the lower part of which is almost blocked up 
by fallen debris. The following rarer plants grow here.

The edge of Cronkley fell for about a mile is girdled by a series of steep 
basaltic cliffs, which extend from the neighbourhood of the White Force 
westward to the spur of the hill which is opposite the termination of Falcon 
Clints. These are called Cronkley Scars. They are from one to two 
hundred feet in depth, as viewed from a distance the colour of mist or 
smoke-grey, made up of an infinite number of depressions and projections, 
and though the greenstone rock is seldom to be seen in masses of any con- 
siderable size, yet it is so much broken up and breaks away so easily, as 
to render it a somewhat dangerous exploit to climb amongst the steeper 
parts of them. Little streamlets trickle over the cliffs in several places, 
and the slope at the bottom of the scar is thickly strewn with debris. 
The following are the rarer plants of these scars, and of the open space 
beneath them, and adjacent river bank.

Opposite Cronkley the Tees receives a considerable stream from the 
north, which is called Langdon beck. Immediately below the mouth of 
this is the bridge by which access is obtained to the Yorkshire side of the 
river from the high road between Middleton and Alston. When the 
stream is low it is just possible to wade across it in this part, but under 
ordinary circumstances the attempt is not to be recommended. Below the 
bridge the river again sweeps round to the foot of the Yorkshire fells and 
upon the Durham side we have a repetition of Falcon Glints upon a small- 
er scale in Force garth scars. On the south side of the Tecs the little 
stream of Blca beck forms a narrow steep glen through the Basalt, leap- 
ing from ledge to ledge, and overhung with moss-covered rocks, the brown 
moor8 sweeping from it on either side. And then cornea the High Force. 
Here the main stream of the Tees, its waters contracted often into a aingle 
deep narrow channel, makea a sheer leap of 69 feet into a noble ravine, 
the cliffs of which margin the 8tream for a considerable distance below it. 
The cliff is dark coloured basalt, resting immediately upon dark coloured 
indurated shale, with limestone below it, and when the stream is full the 
water flows upon both sidea of the massive angular crag which overlooks 
the main descent. On the Durham side of the river the slope is covered 
by a large plantation, consisting principally of spruce firs, and on the 
Yorkshire side the moors reach down to the edge of the cliffs. A more 
beautiful spot for a summer day's excursion than this ravine, with its

never-ending roar of waters, in front the cataract with its ceaseless rush 
and cloud of misty spray, at the bottom the dark foaming stream flowing 
rapidly amongst thickly strewn boulders and margined in the open space 
below the cliffs with a grove of fantastically shaped juniper bushes, shut 
in above by its wood-covered slope and girdle of dark crags, can scarcely 
be wished for. By the side of the high road at the top of the wood stands 
the High force Inn, with a fine view of the waterfall, over the tree tops, 
from its upper windows. 

Between the High force and the Lune three streams of considerable 
size flow into the Tees from the north. The distance between the two 
points is about six miles and the fall in the stream about forty feet per 
mile. The river channel is now considerably deeper than it is above the 
High force, and especially during the first two miles the stream side is 
much undulated and its banks are often rocky and precipitous. There is 
a wooden bridge at Lower Cronkley, where the High force ravine opens 
out, and where the cliffs are steepest, about two miles below the High 
force, a chain bridge spans the river. This is called Winch bridge and in 
its neighbourhood are a series of fine rapids and upon the Durham side a fir 
plantation again skirts the river. Opposite Winch bridge the hills again 
recede from the river and from this point to the Lime they run parallel 
with it at a distance from it of about half a mile, leaving an open grassy 
and somewhat wooded space at the bottom of the dale. Above the village 
of Holwick the continuation of the Mickle fell ridge, which here is called 
Green fell, still reaches the Upper zone and below it is the wide grassy 
plateau of Holwick fell. From the High force the smoke-grey basaltic 
crags range along the edge of the gradually declining fells past Holwick 
and Unthank and only terminate a short distance before the Lune is reach- 
ed. The following, in addition to some of those which have been already 
mentioned, are the rarer plants of Holwick Scars.

At the Lune, which at its junction with the Tees is 700 feet above the 
sea-level, Upper Teesdale may be considered to terminate. Respecting 
the Geology of the tract almost all which it is necessary to say is contain- 
ed in the Geological chapter. At the bottom of the upper part of the dale, 
forming the cliffs of Cronkley and those over which the river falls at the 
Caldron Snout is the great basaltic mass, which extends up Maze beck for 
a couple of miles and in an eastern direction occupies the bed of the stream 
as far as the High force. A little lower down it leaves the bed of the 
river and ranges along the southern slope of the dale almost as far as the 
Lime. The stratification of the sedimentary rocks is much disturbed and 
complicated by the four faults of which we have spoken and other of lesser

importance. From a floor of Basalt rises upwards the Mickle fell ridge, the 
Lower Mountain Limestone at the bottom, but the greater part of the slope 
made up of the Upper Mountain Limestone, which has patches of Mill- 
stone Grit over it in two places. From this ridge are downthrows towards 
Westmoreland and towards the east and lower down the dale a downthrow 
or steep dip towards the north, so that first the Lower and afterwards the 
Upper Mountain Limestone occupy the river-bed. And then comes the 
thousand feet fault which runs along the line of Lunedale, beyond which 
nothing is seen but the Millstone Grit till we reach the Greta. 

The most noteworthy characteristic which Upper Tecsdale presents 
from a botanical point of view is, that it furnishes several Montane rari- 
ties which as growing there are separated more or less conspicuously from 
the other localities in which they occur. Restricting ourselves to the 
Flowering Plants of the Yorkshire side of the river the following are the 
species which furnish the most striking instances of this exceptionality. 
Polygala austriaca, a species diffused upon the Continent from Scandinavia 
southward to Italy and Transylvania is not known elsewhere in Britain. 
Potent ilia fruticosa and Gentiana verna, both of which are abundant in 
Teesdale and both widely diffused upon the Continent, grow in the West 
of Ireland and sparingly in the Lake district, but are not known else- 
where in Britain. Bartsia alpina grows in Craven and the Lake district 
and from thence leaps to the East Highlands. Elyna caricina is like the 
Bartsia, except that it is not known in Craven. Myosotis alpestris and 
Tofieldia palustris from Teesdale leap to Perthshire ; and Hieracium iricum 
and Carex capillaris are also not known elsewhere in England and leap 
from Tecsdale to the hills of Dumfries-shire. 

The Lune rises upon the edge of the county and the southern slope of 
Micklefell and runs due east along the edge of the fault for seven miles. 
Lunedale at its upper part is a broadly undulated hollow with a good 
road at the bottom, but with very few houses and with its slopes upon 
either side but little diversified by cliffs. The streamlet which flows from 
the east end of the Micklefell ridge forms a small waterfall over a grit- 
stone edge and runs through a lonely mountain tarn about half a mile in 
circumference, upon the banks of which grow Ranunculus csenosus, A llo- 
6orus crispus, Mnium subglobosum, Hypnum stramineum and H. exannu- 
latum. Passing Howgill and the dark Scotch fir plantations of Wemmer- 
gill, which latter runs up to the south slope of Green fell, three miles 
from the junction of the Lune with the Tees the fault crosses it and con- 
tinues along the south side of the dale till it opens out into Teesdale. On

the Durham side of the Tees opposite Lunedale is Middleton, the mining 
capital of the dale. South of the fault is a wide surface of moorland 
country of the eugeogenous type of character. Its two principal dales are 
Balderdale and Deepdale, both of which have pleasant rocky stream chan- 
nels and thick woods in their lower parts, hut open out soon after the 
Middle 2one is reached into broad spreading moorland glens. Kelton fell, 
upon the western edge of the county between Lunedale and Balderdale, 
almost or quite attains the Upper zone. At the foot of its slope towards 
the Tees are Micklcton and Romaldkirk, the latter the old centre of popu- 
lation for the upper part of the dale. At the junction of the Black beck 
and the Balder is the long-known station for Saxifraga Hirculus. Near the 
junction of the Balder with the Tees is the pleasant straggling village of 
Cotherstone. The following are the rarer plants of the woods and stream 
channel of the lower part of Balderdale. 



Enonymus curopaeus 
Ribes pctncum 
Sedum villosum 
Hieracium murorum 
Lathrea squamaria 



Atropa Belladonna 
Gagea lutea 
Orthotrichum rivulare 
Hypnum depressum. 



South of the Balder the moorland bears the general name of Stainmoor, 
and Goldsborough, a broad topped angular peak with edges of Middle 
Gritstone, which is under 500 yards above the sea-level, is conspicuous. 
" Deepdale' s solitude*" is broken now by the rush over it, six times a day, 
of railway passenger trains not to speak of goods trains, and volunteer rifle 
shooting in addition. Deepdale is a deep narrow glen, with waterfalls 
over gritstone edges in the upper part of it, and thick woods with abun- 
dance of the beautiful Silver fir planted amongst them and a profusion of 
Wild Strawberries and Brambles. There is a huge erratic boulder of 
Shap fell granite in the bed of the stream not far from the Tees which is 
well worthy of a visit. Nowhere in North Yorkshire have we a more 
massive edge of gritstone than at Cat castle and from an elevated rocky 
seat overhung by rowan and birch trees there is a charming view of the 
fairy-like viaduct, iron girders throughout and 175 feet from ledge to 
basement, by which the railway spans the glen, and of the undulated 
country round about Barnard Castle, with a background of Durham hills. 
The following arc the rarer plants which Deepdale furnishes :

This railway, the South Durham and Lancashire line, has a fine viaduct 
over the Tees upon stone arches, and runs up the Stainmoor slope, past 
Bowes and over the Pennine ridge at the lowest part of the Stainmoor 
hollow, which is under 500 yards above the sea-level. Where it crosses 
the moors there are fine views from it of Mickle fell and Cross fell upon the 
north and on the south of Water Crag and the Arkendale peaks. Scott's 
oft-quoted lines describe this part of the country as viewed by a sentinel 
from the turret of the castle at Barnard Castle.

Next comes Thorsgill, a small wooded glen on the very edge of the grit- 
stone, with the ruins of Eglestone Abbey npon the edge of it very near 
the junction of the Btream with the Tees. Scott's description of this glen 
and that of the last half mile of the course of the Greta have already been 
quoted (see page 73.) The Greta is the last of the branches of the Tees 
which have their rise amongst the moorlands. From the lowest point of 
the Pennine escarpment there is a rise of 700 feet to the summit of drain- 
age on the south and from the four miles of moorland during which this 
rise takes place the numerous branches of the stream are supplied. The 
total length of Gretadale is about fifteen miles and the course of the stream 
is due east. From Water Crag and Mirk fell we look northward over a 
broadly 'undulated hollow with Kelton fell and Mickle fell in the back 
ground, so wild and dreary that the passing trains look strangely out of 
place, the two "Spitals" at the upper part of Gretadale shining out like 
green oases in a desert of brown moor. Below Sleightholme the southern 
fork of the Greta forms a fine waterfall over the Main Limestone, in the 
neighbourhood of which grow Ranunculus caenosus, Sedum villosum, Poa 
nemoralis and Gymnostomum rupestre. Two miles above Bowes the 
the principal branch of the stream is spanned by a natural arch of Main 
Limestone which bears the name of God's bridge, and for some distance 
below it the stream is usually swallowed up, like the Dove and Bran by 
the Middle Oolite. On the south side of the dale the Main Limestone 
girdles the edge of a steep moor past Hope and Barningham, * beneath a

rounded swell of gritstone which sweeps away from the top of it to the 
summit of the ridge, till at last, at the junction of the Greta with the Tees 
at Rokeby, 380 feet above the sea, we have the limestone down again to 
the level of the river. The finest piece of cliff is at Gilmanscar, opposite 
Bowes, a station for Draba incana, Saxifraga hypnoides and Leskea subru- 
fa. The lowest strata of the dale are those of the bed of the river at 
Rutherford bridge. Below Brignal and Scargill the stream runs in a deep 
glen, with flagstone quarries and steep woods. Rokeby, with its rocky 
river channel and thick woods and limestone scars, with if ort ham's Tower 
and Fitz-Hugh's tomb on the crest of the southern slope, and the charm- 
ing Dairy bridge, and the steep sylvan bank of the Tees where it breaks 
through the limestone immediately beneath the Abbey bridge, should be 
visited by all tourists. The following are the rarer plants of these stations : 



Stellaria nemorum 
Astragalus glycyphyllos 
Vicia sylvatica 
Epilobium angustifolium 
Rubus sazatilis 
Ribes petrseum 
Lathrea squamaria

Taxus baccata 

From the Greta eastward to the district boundary is a tract of undulated 
low country, with a good deal of wood and generally a strong clayey soil, 
which altogether occupies something under a quarter of the whole district. 
It has no town in it or village of any considerable size and does not any-

fared to have a precipice low down upon the hillside, rather than near the top : liked an extent of

the wan at the top, and had hia attention early directed to those horizontal, or comparatively hori-

fait that the claims upon his regard possessed by those places which first had opened to him the joy 
and the labour of bis life could never be superseded. No alpine cloud could efface, no Italian sunbeam 
outshine the memory of the pleasant dales and days of Rokeby and Bolton : and many a simple pro- 
montory dim with southern olive, many a lone cliff that stooped unnoticed over some alien wave, 
was recorded by him with a love and a delicate care that were the shadows of old thoughts and long-

where exceed five miles in breadth from north to south. A little stream 
which rises in the low country not far from the Greta flows due east and 
enters the Tees at Croft. The limestone sweeps obscurely round the 
upper part of its hollow and the remainder of the surface is mainly occu- 
pied, on the west by the Millstone Grit and on the east by the New Red 
Sandstone. At Pierse bridge the Magnesian Limestone, which comes out 
in strong force upon the north of the river, just shews itself in a cliff by 
the Tees side. Here grow Anemone Pulsatilla, Helleborus viridis, 8am- 
bucus "Ebulus and Stachys ambigua. From Pierse bridge to Croft an em- 
bankment sweeps along by the riverside, sometimes coming up to the 
waters edge and sometimes retreating from it for a short space upon which, 
where it is dry and sandy, grow Rosa Sabini, Scabiosa columbaria, Picris 
hieracioides and Origanum vulgare. At a distance of about a mile from 
the TeeB at Stapleton is situated upon the Durham side of the river the 
town of Darlington. By the side of the Tees in the Central Valley 
Scirpus pauciflorus and Stellaria nemorum occur and there is abundance 
of Myrrhis odorata, and some of the Montane rarities which grow about the 
upper part of the river, as for instance Gent inn a verna, Galium borcale 
and Plantago maritima, may occasionally be seen to establish themselves 
for a while. Halnaby Carr, a small piece of wooded swampy ground 
about a mile from Croft by the side of the road to Richmond, is a good 
botanical locality. It yields Ranunculus Lingua, Pyrola rotundifolia, 
Listera cordata, Carex teretiuscula, C. strict a, Eriophorum gracile, Hyp- 
num stramineum and abundance of H. Blandovii and II. nitens, and in an 
adjacent lane is a station for J uncus dififusus. 

The ascertained flora of this district is decidedly below that of five of 
the others. Of the Montane species it has 77 out of 85, which is consid- 
erably more than any of the others can furnish, but the Montane is the 
sole category in which it can claim a superiority. Its Xerophilous species 
are neither so numerous nor so abundant as in the West Swale, Yore and 
Derwcnt districts. Of the submaritime species it has one only ; its Hy- 
grophilous plants are very few in number and rare ; and its Rarer ascend- 
ing considerably under the average number. The following is an 
analytical table of its flora ;

CHAPTER VII. 

NO. 7. THE TORE DI8TRICT. 

The 'upper part of Wensleydalc is very different from that of either 
Teesdale or Swaledale. In Teesdale there is no highroad on the Yorkshire 
side of the river westward of Holwick and on the Durham side that -which 
runs between Middleton and Alston leaves the neighbourhood of the Tees 
not far above the High force and turns towards the north to cross the 
summit of drainage. Higher than this there is nothing to be seen during 
the ten miles which intervene before the low country at the foot of the 
great Pennine escarpment can be reached but a single farm house and a 
nobleman's shooting box, surrounded by crags and streams and the wide 
waste of trackless moorland over which Micklefcll and Crossfell reign su- 
preme. Swaledale is hemmed in and isolated by its guardian crescent 
of high undulated peaks and the way out at the dale head is by a lonely 
little road which winds between them over a steep mountain pass 1700 
feet in elevation. But "Wensleydalc, even at its upper part, is a broad open 
hollow, with good highways leading out of it in three different directions 
into Mallerstang, Garsdale and Ribblesdalo over passes the ascent to which 
is very gradual and the highest of which does not attain 450 yards above 
the sea-level. 

The Eden for a very short but very interesting portion of its early course 
is the county boundary. The three streams, Eden, Swale and Tore, all 
rise within a short distance of one another amongst the group of hill* to 
which the crescent peaks of Swaledale belong. Beneath these on the 
west is a broad open hollow, with a group of dark rugged hills rising ab- 
ruptly upon the opposite side of it, of which "Wild Boar fell (2327 feet) is 
the highest, but none of which belong to the North Riding. To the north 
stretches the gradually widening glen of the Eden (Mallerstang), to the

south that of the Tore ("Wensleydale). The Eden is a mere mountain 
rivulet till it has descended from the fells into the hollow, and then, with 
an undulated sweep of ordinary grassy heathery moorland all around, it 
plunges suddenly into what is called Hell gill, in some respects certainly 
the most remarkable glen which our field of study has to shew. From 
the very edge of the water upon both sides limestone precipices, to a 
height of fifty feet, rise so shcerly and abruptly, that in one place, with 
the maddened mountain torrent foaming and boiling at a depth of fifty feet 
beneath their edges, it is easy to leap across from one crag to the other. 
The length of the ravine is under a quarter of a mile and in it the stream 
declines rapidly in level. The cliffs are over-grown in many places by 
mosses and bushes, but the recesses of the glen it is almost impossible to 
explore without a rope, for its sides are much too steep to be climbed, and 
there is nothing at the bottom but the mere stream channel, and not very 
far from its opening there is a pool of dark peat-stained water a couple of 
yards in depth, into which if a luckless mountain sheep fall, woe betide it. 
The rarer plants of the glen are Draba incana, Hicracium murorum, As- 
plenium viride, Gymnostomnm rupestre, and Bartramia (Ederi. 

The Yore runs down into the hollow from the peaks at a very short 
distance from the Eden and nearly parallel with it. From the Shaw 
Paddock Inn, which stands by the side of the high road at a distance of 
not much more than a mile from Hell gill, it flows for six miles towards 
the south east. Here it increases rapidly and from the moors upon both 
sides of the hollow little streams join it at very short intervals. On the 
east we have a long unbroken ridge, called Cotter fell, which attains 2186 
feet at its culminating point Upon the east side of this ridge is Cotter- 
dale, a dale with two long branches which stretch up far amongst the 
moors in the direction of Shunnor Fell. In one of the ravines there is a 
waterfall, with a curious little cavern in the limestone, about which Epilo- 
bium angustifolium and Hypnum pulchellum grow. There is also a fine 
sylvan waterfall upon the Cotter not far from its junction with the Yore. 
And upon the south we have Mossdale, also with waterfalls, where grow 
Meconopsis cambrica, Meum athamanticum, Encalypta ciliata, Bryum 
crudum and Bartramia (Ederi. 

At Apperset bridge Ceterach offlcinarum grows. Here "Widdale beck 
from the south-west joins the Yore upon almost equal terms and from this 
point downwards it is a considerable stream. Along the west side of 
Widdale stretches a long high ridge of moorland, bare and grassy and 
towering upwards with wall-like abruptness, of which the peak attains

2203 feet. The Main Limestone scars which girdle it and the limestone 
pavement of the hill-top have been mentioned already and will often be re- 
ferred to, along with the similar pavement of Cam fell, in speaking of the as- 
cending limits of plants. A rounded mass of hill called Woe fell (1829 feet) 
stands at the point of junction of Widdale, Dentdale and Ribblcsdale. Wid- 
dale has two branches, Widdale proper and Snaizeholme, both bare and 
grassy and both with steep grassy banks the monotony of which scars of 
limestone sometimes pleasantly relieve. The high and wall-like western 
ridge is fully three miles in length and forms the background of most of 
the views from the lower part of Wensleydale. The following are the 
rarer plants of Widdale j

The little town of Hawes stands at an elevation of from 800 to 900 feet 
above the sea level within a mile of the point where Widdale beck joins 
the main stream of Yore. Seven dales, on the north Mossdale, Yoredale 
proper, Cotterdale and Fossdale, on the south Widdale, Gale dale and 
Seamerdale, all open out within three miles of Hawes, radiating from it 
towards the west, north and south. From Hawes due east to Leyburn 
extends the main Wensleydale hollow, fifteen miles in length, a noble 
dale, broad and Bteep, the stream at the upper part at least 1400 feet 
below the hill-tops, the sides of the dale girdled by long lines of limestone 
â€¢car, with little villages at the bottom succeeding each other at short in- 
tervals, surrounded by pastures and rich luxuriant meadows. 

The north side of the dale is much more continuous and less broken 
than the south, its streams being shorter and its branch dales narrower 
and less deeply excavated. Next to Cotterdale comes Fossdale. Its two 
branches extend for a considerable distance into the moors, and then the 
two becks unite to form a stream which from their junction falls rapidly 
amongst thick woods, and at last not far from the Yore throws itself over 
a precipice 99 feet in depth, and forms that gem of the Yoredale water- 
falls, Hardraw force. The cap rock of the fall is the Hardraw Limestone, 
which also forms scars round the edge of the glen which leads up to it, 
and this is based upon shale, the limestone projecting so much beyond the 
shale that it is often quite practicable to pass between the spout of water

and the bottom of the rock, though it is at the risk of being drenched by 
the clond of spray which surrounds it. The following are the rarer plants 
of the cliffs and woods of Fossdale and of this Hardraw ravine ; 



The top of Fossdale is coincident with the head of the stream which 
falls into the Swale from the south-west at Muker. Along the edge of 
the two glens runs the road which leads across the moors from Muker to 
Ha we 3. The pass is called the Buttertubs pass. On the west of it rises 
the huge bulk of Shunnor fell, and on the opposite side Lovely Seat stands 
boldly out against it, the summit of the hill being fully 500 feet above 
the highest point of the pass. Tliis last is perhaps the most conveniently 
situated of all the hills of the district for giving a panoramic view of the 
upper part of the Swaledale and Yoredale hollows and it commands also a 
sight of the peaks of Whernside and Ingleborough. 

From the Lovely Scat peak eastward along the watershed the ridge 
reaches the Upper zone for at least a mile, and on the edge of Yoredale 
immediately over Sedbusk Stag's fell attains 1756 feet. The next glen is 
called Skellgill and is a narrow, uninhabited, somewhat rocky gill which 
run 8 from north-west to south-east and yields Ranunculus caenosus and 
Bryum alpinum. At the little town of Askrigg a very interesting glen, 
also from the north-west, pours its waters into the Yore. This is called 
Whitfell gill and lower down Mill gill, and contains four waterfalls of 
great beauty, two of which are of considerable depth. Its two branches 
run at first for about a couple of miles in undulated moorland hollows and 
then they unite. Immediately beneath the peak of Whitfell, (1691 feet) 
with its limestone precipices, and perhaps the most elevated natural wood 
of any considerable size which we have anywhere in North Yorkshire, the 
stream begins rapidly to descend and soon the first force is reached, con- 
sisting of a series of rapids of which the principal fall is not above twenty 
feet in depth. The next waterfall, Whitfell force, is much broader and 
deeper, and the rocky river banks, covered and surrounded by dense woods,

rise steeply from it on both sides. The two other waterfalls are only a 
very short distance from the town, Millgill force, the finest of the two, 
being a noble fall over a limestone precipice 69 feet in depth, which is 
approached by a wooded and rocky glen. The following are the rarer 
plante of this gill;

From Askrigg to Carperby the hills stand boldly out towards the stream. 
There is along their edge an almost continuous line of the scars of the 
Upper Limestone and the highroad for a considerable distance runs along 
the summit of a wooded scar of Lower Limestone not far from the water's 
edge. At Woodhall are extensive lead mines, the stream which runs from 
them being thickly lined with Armaria maritima down to its junction 
with the Yore. The elevation of the highest point where it here grows 
scarcely exceeds 250 yards. I have not seen the plant elsewhere in an 
inland station except at a much greater altitude amongst the mountains, 
as for instance at the head of the "Whey Sike in Teesdale and upon the 
crags of Twll Du and Crib-y-ddesgil in Snowdonia, but here it is to be met 
with in the greatest luxuriance and profusion. Thlaspi occitanum grows 
sparingly along with it and Scrophularia Ehrharti by the roadside not far 
distant. Past Carperby the dale widens and the hills decline in altitude. 
Above Redmire the ruins of the old castle of Bolton occupy a prominent 
position upon the hillslope. Then comes Preston, with its scar and lead 
mines, with abundance of Arenaria verna and Yiola lutea : and beneath it, 
at the bottom of the hollow, stands Bolton Hall, surrounded with woods, 
and near it the little village of Wensley, which gives its name to the dale. 

From the edge of the moor above Wensley runs a long continuous gra- 
dually-declining scar of Main Limestone which is called Leyburn Shawl. 
The railway now reaches Leyburn, so that this point is brought within 
the compass of an easy day's excursion from Thirsk or York. The hill- 
slope below the cliff is covered with a dense wood, over which beautiful 
views may be obtained of the great "Wensleydalo hollow, and of Pcnhill 
and the branching sylvan dales which run up behind it and past it on the 
south ; and above the scar upwards to the watershed ridge stretch the 
Millstone Grit beds of the hill summits, with extensive flagstone workings 
excavated amongst them. Tho following plants grow either upon the 
Shawl or amongst the debris of the quarries ;

We must now return to Hawes and take the south side of the dale. 
In this direction, as stated before, the branch dales are broader, deeper 
and altogether more important than those of the north side of the river. 
Along the line of watershed on the south the ridge of hill which separates 
Yoredale from Wharf edale scarcely declines anywhere from the head of 
Widdale eastward to the peak of Great Whernside, a distance of at least 
ten miles in a straight line, below the limit of the Upper zone and along 
the whole length of this ridge the Main Limestone reaches a height of 600 
or 650 yards. 

The ridge which bounds Widdale on the east culminates in the peak of 
Dodfell, 2189 feet in height, with a cap of gritstone nearly 300 feet in 
thickness over the Main Limestone. The slope of this hill is very little 
diversified by rock, and the ascent is easy and the view from the summit 
very fine. On the north is Hawes and the broad branching Wensleydale 
hollow with Lovely Seat and the woods of Hardraw in the back ground. 
East and west, immediately beneath the ridge, their streams 1000 feet 
below it, are Widdale and Galedale. Dodfell forms one corner of a square 
of which Whernside, Ingleborough and Pennyghent are the other three 
corners and towards the south we have Cam fell with its limestone pave- 
ment, wild and dreary Langstrothdale and the upper waters of the Wharfe, 
and farther towards the south and west is outspread a wide surface of 
moorland country in which the three peaks which have just been named 
are the most conspicuous objects. The Galedale stream runs through 
Hawes and has a fine waterfall upon it two miles from the Yore, a broad 
spreading fall from thirty to forty feet in depth over limestone based upon 
shale, with steep wooded shaly banks upon both sides of the stream for 
some distance below it. The next ridge has the gritstone over the moun- 
tain limestone in one place only, and that is within two miles of Hawes, 
in the peak of Wetherfell, or as it is sometimes called, Bears head, 2015 
feet in altitude. Seamerdale is unique amongst the North Yorkshire dales 
in its shape and character. The hills that on each side guard its entrance 
stand boldly out towards the Yore, especially Addleborough, at the ter- 
mination of the boundary ridge on the east, a square-topped hill 1564 feet 
in altitude, which is crested by crags of the Underset limestone and forms

a conspicuous object from the lower part of Wensleydale. At the bottom 
of Seamerdale stands the village of Bainbridge and its stream is sometimes 
called the Bain. Two miles from the Yore is a lake which measures be- 
tween two and three miles in circuit, which is called Seamer Water, and 
which is the only lake of even a moderate size of which North Yorkshire 
can boast. Bare steep grassy hills rise with much abruptness from its east- 
ern and western shores, and beyond the lake there is a little village with a 
rustic church, and broad branching glens with woods and scattered farm- 
houses, and numerous gills which penetrate into the recesses of a long steep 
limestone ridge which runs like a wall along the line of watershed on the 
south. The rarer plants of the lake-aide and surrounding crags are 



Ranunculus Lingua 
Hutchinsia pctraea

From Hawes past Bainbridge and Askrigg the fall of the main stream 
of the Yore is very gradual, when the elevation above the sea-level of its 
bed is considered. At Aysgarth, in a deeply excavated rocky channel 
with a wooded bank rising steeply from it upon either side, it begins to 
form a series of picturesque rapids which are continued for about a mile. 
Fed by the waters of the wide-branching dales which one after another 
have poured their contributions into it, the stream is now a fine river. 
Margined by the long winding scars of the Lower Mountain Limestone 
and interpolated plate beds it flows down this pleasant Aysgarth glen, its 
dark peat-stained waters hemmed in upon both sides by shelving reaches 
of moss-fringed grey limestone rock, and above them there rises a steep 
bank covered thickly with aboriginal trees and brushwood, hazel, white- 
thorn, brambles and roses of multiform specific types, and on the south are 
the broad heathery slopes of Penhill, its peak 1200 feet above the stream. 
The main fall, which is over a limestone precipice about 20 feet in depth, 
is exceedingly fine in the impression of irresistible force which it gives 
when the river is swollen as full as it was the last time that I visited the 
spot. The following are the rarer plants of the glen ;

The next three dales, Bishopdale, Waldendale and Coverdale, are very 
similar to one another in character. They are long narrow dales, with a 
considerable quantity of wood in their lower parts, their sides steep and 
grassy and often crested or girdled by limestone cliffs and they are each 
terminated by a steep narrow neck of land on the lino of the watershed 
ridge. Southward from Addleborough along the ridge between Seamer- 
dale and Bishopdale a broad surface of moorland culminates in Stake fell 
( 1 843 feet.) Opposite the head of Bishopdale and Waldendale and imme- 
diately upon the edge of Wharfedale Buckden Pike attains 2302 feet and 
the ridge which runs from it as a spur towards the north-east and sepa- 
rates the two last mentioned dales from one another attains 1876 feet in 
Wasset fell. This Wasset fell spur ceases at a considerable distance from 
the Yore, leaving a broad open well wooded hollow in which are the vil- 
lages of Thoralby and West Burton, and the two streams unite a mile 
above where they join the main river. The rarer plants of the woods and 
crags and fields of these two dales are 



Draba incana 
Potentilla alpestris

Pursuing our course still further towards the east we come next to the 
ridge which separates Waldendale from Coverdale. It runs from Buckden 
Pike towards the north-east and terminates in Pen hill (1817 feet), a fine 
broad massive heathery fell which stands boldly out into the main dale of 
Yore and forms a very conspicuous object in the view from Leyburn and

the Yale of Mowbray. Coverdale is twelve miles in length, its upper part 
being guarded by high hills upon both sides. Opposite Buckden Pike 
there is Great Whernside* (2310 feet), an undulated grassy hill which 
commands beautiful views down Wharfedale and Nidderdale and over the 
lower summits to the east of it and across the Vale of York. This peak 
is the termination on the east of the long ridge of high moor that runs 
along the line of watershed between Yore and Wharfe and upon its east- 
ward slope the Nidd has its source ; and looking from Thirsk westward it 
is the highest point upon the line of the horizon. From Great Whernside 
and Little Whernside (1985 feet) the peaks decline gradually along the 
ridge towards the north-east, Rover Crag, which guards the entrance to 
the dale opposite Penhill, being 1552 feet in elevation. The ground 
about the lower part of the course of the Cover is open and well-wooded. 
The town and massive old castle at Middleham stand upon the slope of a 
spur of Penhill not far from the junction of the Cover with the Yore. 
The following are the rarer plants of the dale ; 



Astragalus glycyphyllos 
Epilobium angustifolium 
Sedum villosum 
Cotyledon Umbilicus 
Galium sylvestre 
Salix phylicifolia 
Ophrys muscifera

As we have now reached the point at which "Wensloydalc is usually 
considered to terminate, a brief general sketch of its geology may suitably 
be here introduced. From Hawes eastward as far as Bedmire we have the 
Lower Mountain Limestone occupying the bottom of the dale, rather more 
than 200 feet of its upper beds being altogether exposed. Over these are 
the strata of the Yorcdalc series, at the upper part of the dale 970 feet in 
thickness, five thick bands of limestone with still thicker interpolations of 
non-calcareous material, tho strata answering to each other upon the slope 
of the opposite hills from south to north with but trifling difference in 
level. Along the ridge of watershed from the head of "Widdale eastward 

â€¢ This mnit not be confounded with the better known Craven Whernside, which is due north of 
IngUborough and south-west of Hawes.

to the head of Bishopdalo the surface of tho Upper or Main band of the 
Yoredale limestones attains an elevation of from 1900 to 1950 feet. Be- 
tween the head of Bishopdalo and the Wharf edale side of Great Whern- 
side the summit of the series sinks to 1700 feet and its thickness becomes 
very much diminished, principally by the obliteration of its upper beds. 
In the immediate neighbourhood of Hawes we have the Main Limestone 
at an elevation of about 1800 feet on the south side and of about 1700 feet 
on the north side of the dale : and as we go down the dale it declines gra- 
dually in level. It reaches 1100 feet on the east side of Penhill, 850 
feet in Middleham Moor, 700 feet at Leyburn, and sinks to 400 feet at 
East Witton. And above the strata of these two sets of Mountain Lime- 
stone beds we have the beds of the Millstone Grit series forming tho cap- 
rock of many of the summits, and reaching their greatest thickness, that 
is to say, with most of the bands not disintegrated away, in Great Whern- 
side, Penhill and Lovely Seat. 

East of Leyburn tho moorlands ceaso and the district which the Yore 
drains on the north becomes still narrower than before. On tho south 
side of the river we have now an undulated moorland gritstone country, 
eloping suddenly towards the east, and penetrated by a eugeogenous dale, 
the stream of which runs from west to east and has numerous branches. 
It is about ten miles in length and the dale is called Colsterdale. The 
town of Masham stands upon the banks of its stream not far from the 
point where it joins the Yore, the latter being here 250 feet above the sea- 
level, and the top of the ridge which separates Colsterdale from Co verdale 
being upwards of 1500 feet above it. 

From Leyburn to its junction with the Swale the Yore has a course of 
nearly thirty miles and through the low country it runs with many 
windings in a south-eastern direction. Soon after it has passed Masham 
it becomes the boundary of the North Biding on the south. The gritstone 
still continues along the banks of the river as far as Tanfield, through the 
woods opposite the pleasant undulated sylvan grounds of Hackfall. On 
the north sido of the stream we have here Viola scpincola, Bryum uligino- 
sum and Hypnum pra tense. A tract of Magnesian Limestone bounds the 
Gritstone on the east, the beds of which extend from Thornton Watlass 
past Well and Nosterfield, and form a narrow terrace, which, although it 
scarcely attains anywhere an altitude above tho sea level of 100 yards, 
yet has something of a slope in the direction of the dip of its beds towards 
the Central Valley. The limestone rocks form rapids in the bed of the 
stream below Tanfield bridge, and margin its northern bank with low

cliffs for a short distance. This little tract of Magnesian Limestone, here 
as southwards, produces several interesting plants, especially of the Xero- 
philous category, of which the following seem to be the most noteworthy ; 



Helleboru8 Tiridis 
Astragalus glycyphyllos

The remaining portion of the district belongs to the Central Valley. 
The stream is the boundary of the Biding and the tract which it drains on 
the north varies from two to four miles in width. The city of Bipon 
stands upon the edge of the Magnesian Limestone not far from the river 
immediately opposite the part we have now reached. Hutton Moor was 
once a tract of low sandy heatherland but it is now cut through by the 
railway and almost entirely enclosed. The following are the rarer plants 
of the roadsides, fields and stream side in the vicinity of Sutton Conyers j 



Myosurus minimus 
Spergularia rubra 
Ornithopus perpusillus

At Myton the Swale and Yore join, the river now bearing the name of 
Ouse and keeping it till it opens out into the Humber estuary. 

In plants of the Montane category this district is about upon a par with

and they are all four plants of West Yorkshire, and the same may be said 
of Cotyledon Umbilicus, which is not classed here with the Montane 
species. In plants of the Xerophilous category the district is about upon 
a par with West Swale and Derwcnt, these three being considerably above 
any of the others. The district contains only a very limited tract of the 
Central Valley and for plants of tho Hygrophilous category is below all 
the others except West Tees and Esk ; and for the Rarer ascending species 
it is below West Swale, East Tees, East Swale and Derwent.

CHAPTER VIII. 

50. 6. THE KTDD AND WHARFE DISTRICT. 
(THE AINSTT.) 

This district is considerably smaller and contains within its limits much 
less variety of situation than any of the others. It is 84 square miles in 
area, being bounded on the north by the Nidd, on the east by the Ousc, 
on the south by the Wharfe, and on the west by a conventional line drawn 
from Colthorpe on the Nidd to the Wharfe side between Thorp Arch and 
Wetherby. The city of York is about midway between the two points 
where the Nidd and the Wharfe join the Ouse, about half of it being situ- 
ated on the west side of this latter river. The Magnesian Limestone 

â–  _____ 

forms a sloping bank along the north side of the Wharfe as far westward 
from Thorp Arch as the district extends, and the remainder of it, fully 80 
square miles, belongs to the Central Valley. There arc no streams of any 
considerable size which run through the district, but the rivers which 
bound it on three Bides arc large and fine. As in the rest of the Central 
Valley, the ground varies very slightly in level and nowhere attains an 
elevation above the sea of 100 yards. The soil is sometimes clayey, but 
more often light and sandy, especially in the north-east. Besides York 
and Acomb the district contains several pleasant rural villages, which are 
separated from one another by well-cultivated fields, intersected by long 
winding grassy lanes, and in addition to these, two lines of main road and 
three of railway run through it and the towns of Thorp Arch and Tadcas- 
ter are situated just beyond its limits. 

The best botanical localities are Askham bogs and the sloping wooded 
bank of Magnesian Limestone which margins the Wharfe above Thorp 
Arch. At Thorp Arch, as at Tanfield, the most noteworthy plants of the 
limestone are species which range under the Xerophilous category. The 
following is the Thorp Arch list ;

district. Of the Montane plants it has only seven of the commoner species 
and these are almost, if not quite, restricted to the calcareous undulations 
in the vicinity of the Wharfe. In Xerophilous and Hygrophilous plants 
it occupies an intermediate position amongst the districts, and although it 
is much smaller than any of the others, yet for the Rarer ascending species 
one district is below it.

CHAPTER IX. 

NO. 5. TITE EAST TEES DISTRICT. 

This includes the western portion of Cleveland. A large proportion of 
its watershed on the east and south reaches into tho Middle zone, hut, 
unlike the Esk district, it does not include any considerable tract of hea- 
therland within its limits, and the greater part of its surface is under one 
hundred yards above the sea level. The main stream of Tees forms the 
boundary of the district on the north-west, and a branch of moderate 6ize, 
which is called the Leven, runs through it from east to west. 

The higher hills along the line of watershed are all capped by the Sand- 
stone of the Lower Oolite, the maximum thickness of which, in this tract, 
is under three hundred feet. Below it, occupying the steep slope of the 
moorlands, and spreading out for a considerable breadth round their base, 
stretch the Liassic beds, with a maximum thickness of 850 feet ; and west 
of the line where the Lias ceases there is fully one-half of the district 
which belongs to the great Central Valley. 

The southern fork of the Leven rises on the edge of the Middle zone in 
front of Burton head (1489 feet), the loftiest of the East Yorkshire peaks. 
From tho top of this hill there is a very fine and extensive view of the dales 
of the Esk and the Dcrwent and the moorlands which surround them, over 
the low-lying cultivated Cleveland country on the north, of Kildale Moor 
and the wooded basaltic ridge and the peak of Roscbcrry Topping rising 
behind it, and further to the west, of the Tecs estuary, and the long wind- 
ing line of tho Durham coast as far as Hartlepool and Sunderland and the 
mouth of the Tyne. From this culminating peak a lino of high moorland, 
with an abrupt westward slope, runs in a northern direction towards ano- 
ther branch of the same stream. From Burton head another line of high 
moorland runs also due west, the highest peaks being immediately over

the edge of Cleveland, and the Cleveland streams, the branches of the 
southern fork of the Leven, scarcely penetrating the moorland mass, whilst 
on the south of the peaks there is an extensive area of hill-country and 
the streams have to run down long dales before they reach the open valley. 
At the head of Bilsdale, which is the hollow immediately west of Burton 
head, the pass is under 300 yards, and the Oolitic Sandstone quite cut 
through. "West of this we have the Wainstones (1317 feet), Cranimoor 
(1427 feet), and Carlton Bank (1338 feet), bare undulated peaks separa- 
ted from one another by the glens which unite to form Bilsdale : and still 
further to the west the watershed ridge reaches 1048 feet over Whorlton 
and Swainby, from which point the boundary line of the hill-country 
sweeps abruptly round towards the south. Along the line of this hill-bank, 
which bounds Cleveland on the south, the Lias attains an elevation of 
1200 feet and the slope from the top of the hills down to about 100 yards 
is very sudden. Along the crest of the hill the Oolitic Sandstone forms 
crags at several points, the bank being in some places bare and shaly and 
in some places overspread with fir plantations. In one place only is there 
a rounded knoll of hill insulated from the principal mass, and that is in 
the neighbourhood of "Whorlton, towards the western extremity of the 
embankment. The southern branch of the Leven runs parallel with the 
bank at a short distance from its base, and although several small streams 
have their rise upon this hillside, only one of them has a dale, and that is 
called Scngdale, and is situated also near the western extremity of the 
ridge. The following are the rarer plants of the woods and rocks and 
hillslopes from Battersby westward by way of Burton head and Ingleby 
Greenhow to the neighbourhood of Stokcsley ;

NORTII YORKSHIRE. 



The more northern branch of the Leven, of which mention haa been al- 
ready made, has ite rise in the recesses of the hill-country, and runs for 
some distance down a dale the only dale of any considerable size which there 
is in this drainage district. By one of the forks of this branch which runs 
down a deep lonely gill a triangular tract of hill is separated from the main 
mass. The glen is called Lounsdale and the hill Kildale Moor, and it 
reaches an altitude of 1064 feet. The main dale of this northern branch 
of the Leven is called Kildale. The pass from its upper extremity into 
one of the branch dales of the Esk does not reach the height of the Oolite, 
which here descends considerably lower than at Burton head, and the 
North Yorkshire and Cleveland railway now margins its stream, and runs 
across the narrow heathery pass into Eskdale. The basaltic dike from 
Ayton passes through Kildale Moor, and ascends Kildale in the direction 
of Gastleton, and in some places woods and fir plantations stretch up the 
slope of the hill to the edge of the heather. The following arc the rarer 
plants of Kildale and Lounsdale ; 



Geranium sylvaticum 
Rubus plicatus

Grimmia trichophylla 
Diphyscium foliosum 
Tetraplodon mnioides 
Hypnum strain incum 



Opposite the north-west corner of Kildale Moor is the singular hill 
called Rosebcrry Topping. It is a rounded knoll of hill, sharply insulated 
from the main mass of the moorland, standing boldly out against the level 
country, and forming a conspicuous object from the surrounding plain and 
the valley far away. It is capped with a crag of Oolitic Sandstone and 
attains an elevation of 1057 feet. In hedges at the little village of New- 
ton, which lies immediately beneath it, and 700 feet below its summit, 
Rosa hibernica grows. From Kildale moor the basaltic dike passes on the 
south side of Rosebcrry Topping, and underlies a wooded ridge about 200 
yards in height behind the village of Great Ayton, from which point it 
declines westward past Langbargh till it is lost beneath the New Red 
Sandstone of the Central Valley. Above Ayton it is called

above Langbargh, Langbargh rigg. In two or three places by the side of 
the stream near Ay ton arc bushes of Salix acutifolia. The following are 
the rarer plants of the woods and fields of the basaltic dike in this vicinity ; 



Viola hirta 
Medicago maeulata

Campanula Rapunculus 
Lamium Galeobdolon 
Narcissus pseudo-narcissus 
Allium Scorodoprasum 
Hedwigia ciliata 



Not far from the western edge of the Lias there is an insulated mass of 
hill, called Eston Nab, which is capped with Oolitic Sandstone and attains 
an altitude of 800 feet It immediately overlooks the Tees estuary, and 
the Ironstone beds of the Liaa are worked largely upon its sea-ward slope. 
The two branches of the Leven the course of which we have been tracing 
unite near the town of Stokesley, and the stream flows with many wind- 
ings in a north-western direction past Hutton Rudby and Hilton through 
the Central Valley portion of the district and falls into the Tees between 
Yarm and Stockton. 

The course of the main stream of Tees we have still to follow. It is 
now a fine large river, and flows with many windings through a richly 
cultivated flat country. Along the edge of this drainage district its gen- 
eral course is towards the north-east, and its banks about Middleton and 
Dinsdale are often steep and pleasantly wooded. The town of Yarm is on 
the Yorkshire side of the river not far from the mouth of the Leven. 
From Yarm up the stream to "Worsall is a pleasant sail by boat when the 
tide is high. Five miles north-east of Yarm is the town of Stockton- 
on-Tees, the principal part of which stands upon the Durham side of 
the stream. The following arc the rarer plants of the woods and low 
marshland and sandy fields near the Tees in the neighbourhood of 
these two towns ;

The thriving town of Middlesbro', with its docks and blast-furnaces, 
stands upon the Yorkshire shore just where the river begins to open out 
into an estuary. A list of the introduced plants of the ballast hills in the 
neighbourhood of this town will be given hereafter. From Middlesbro' to 
Redcar the coast is margined by a series of low marshy fields, intersected 
by tidal ditches,* in front of which the shore line is bounded in some places 
by low undulated sandhills. The railway runs not far from the sea in a 
direct line between the two points, beneath Eston Nab and the woods of 
Wilton, and in front of the long straggling village of Coatham. The fol- 
lowing are the rarer plants of the salt-water ditches, sandhills and salt 
marshes of this part of the coast, which is, as has been already remarked, 
the only portion of the North Yorkshire sea-line which furnishes a good 
supply of the characteristically Maritime species ;

The sandhills of the coast line between Redcar and Marske, like those 
between Redcar and Middlesbro', yield some of the commoner Xerophilons 
species. Here occur Cerastium arvense, Poterium Sanguisorba, Scabioaa 
Columbaria, and Astragalus Hypoglottis. 

This district has very nearly all tho characteristically Maritime species 
which are to be met with anywhere in North Yorkshire, Hippohae rham- 
noides and Asplenium marinum being the only exceptions. For plants of 
the Montane category it is third out of the four hilly districts of the east. 
Its Xerophilous plants are few in number and rare, being very nearly res- 
tricted to the coast sandhills and basaltic ridge. For Hygrophilous plants 
it has five of the districts above, and three below it, and for the Rarer 
ascending species only the much larger districts of Derwent and West 
Swale conspicuously exceed it.

CHAPTER X. 

No. 4. THE E8K DISTRICT. 

This district includes the eastern portion of Cleveland. A large propor- 
tion of its surface is made up of undulated heatherland, and broad ramified 
dales of the eugeogenous type of character. The Esk flows through the 
district from west to east, the principal dales which' its branches run down 
being upon tho south side of it The line of watershed round the upper 
part of the river on the south extends into the Middle zone ; but on the 
north of the river the broad sweep of heatherland, which occupies the 
greater part of the surface between tho Esk and the coast line, nowhere 
from Castleton eastward reaches an altitude of 1000 feet, and is mostly 
considerably lower. It is a district of steep crumbling sea cliffs, and 
pleasant dales, and undulated swells of low heatherland, but including very 
few ridges or peaks which reach even the Middle zone, and very little low 
lying, flat country ; and of our nine drainage districts this is the only one 
within which no portion of the Central Valley is comprised. 

Throughout the district, except along the course of the basaltic dike, the 
Lower Oolite occupies the higher, and the Lias the lower levels of tho 
surface. Soutli of the EBk we have the Lias at an elevation of 1200 feet 
in Burton head, and from thence declining due east to a height of rather 
more than 500 feet in the cliff on the south side of Robin Hood's bay. 
The Esk runs in a synclinal depression of the strata, the Oolite coming 
quite down to the shore on the north side, and very nearly so in the cliffs 
on the south side of its mouth. But on the north side of the river the beds 
rise again, and we have the Lias at an elevation of nearly 1000 feet in 
Rosebcrry Topping and Guisbro' Moor, and from this point sinking to 180 
feet in Huntcliffe, and 340 feet in the great cliff near Lofthouse.

Sleddale, the dale of the north-west branch of the Esk, begins not far 
from Roseberry Topping. At first its stream runs parallel with the Kildale 
branch of the Leven, and this dale is separated from Kildale only by a 
narrow ridge of hill. On the opposite, or north-eastern side of the dale, a 
ridge of moorland runs parallel with it for four miles, and attains an ele- 
vation of 1078 feet. The lower part of the dale is broad and open, and 
contains many farmhouses, surrounded by woods and cultivated fields. 
The following are the rarer plants of this dale and the surrounding moors ; 



Hypericum elodes 
Myriophyllum verticillatum 
Scirpus paucifiorus 
Carex teretiuscula 
Sphagnum molluscum 
Oymnostomum rupestre

Castleton, the centre of population for the upper part of Eskdale, is 
situated near tho point where the Sleddale stream unites with one which 
flows from the south-west. In addition to Sleddale, three of the branch 
dales from the south, Baysdale, Westcrdale, and Danbydale, all open out 
into the main dale of the Esk within a short distance of Castleton. Tho 
ridge of hill from Burton head eastward along the line of watershed 
between Esk and Derwent reaches for several miles continuously into the 
Middle zone, and Looschoe Moor, at the head of Danbydale, attains an ele- 
vation of fully 1400 feet The ridges of hill between these dales are 
narrow, and stand out boldly into the main dale of Esk. Baysdale is a 
secluded, thinly populated dale, with an abbey and thick fir plantations ; 
Wosterdale, a branched and more cultivated and populous hollow ; and 
Danbydale from Castleton runs up due south into the recesses of the high 
anticlinal ridge which forms the drainage summit. Neither about the Esk 
nor along the crest of the dales about Castleton, is there much rock to be 
seen, but everywhere pastoral farmhouses, and woods and green meadows 
emerging from beneath the swelling curvatures of the lines of the heathery 
hills. The following are the more remarkable plants of this neighbourhood ;

From Castleton to the mouth of the Esk at Whitby the distance is 
fourteen miles, the course of the stream due east, and the fall in its bed 
but trifling. Qn the north-east of Castleton the moor attains an elevation 
of 988 feet in Danby Beacon, which commands an excellentÂ»view of a wide 
surface of heathery country on the north and north-east, diversified by 
tumuli and woods and glens, and bounded by the winding line of the coast. 
Lower down the river there is on the north a long narrow wooded glen 
called Stonegate gill, and on the south three more of the branch dales, 
Great Fryupdale, Little Fryupdale, and Glazedale. On the end of the 
spur of hill between Danbydale and Fryupdale stand the ruins of the old 
castle of the Braces, from which Castlcton takes its name, surrounded by 
plantations of feathery larches. There is a communication over a neck of 
land at their head between the two dales of Fryup, and on the end nearest 
the Esk of the ridge which separates them is Danby Crag, a sandstone 
edgo with a dark holly wood upon its slope, and alder and birch below. 
There is above Lealholme bridge a pleasant steep wooded rocky glen, called 
Crunklcy gill, which is hemmed in upon one sido by the termination 
towards tho Eek of the ridge between Fryupdale and Glazedale : and hero 
grow Rubus Guntheri, Fissidens pusillus, Hypnum pumilum and H. 
heteropteram. Opposite where Glazedale opens out wo have upon tho 
edge of the heather at an elevation of about 200 yards, and at a distance 
from the Esk of a mile, the little town of Egton, and between Glazedale 
and Goathland dalo is the most picturesque portion of the river. The 
channel of the stream is more or less rocky for a considerable distance. 
The basaltic dike, which from Castleton to this point runs along the 
the south side of the dale, here crosses the stream, and forms a scar of 
dark-coloured rock upon its northern bank. The Esk flows in serpentine 
fashion beneath steep much undulated spurs of rock-crested moorland, the 
summits of which rise to a height of 150 or 200 yards above it, and the 
slopes of which towards the river are covered with wood, partly natural 
and partly planted. On the north of the stream rises the basaltic crag of 
Limber hill : on the south for a mile the woods of Arncliffe border it : and 
beyond them, at the bottom of a nest of hills which surround it upon every 
Bide, except where the streams break through them, is the village of Egton 
bridge. This is a favourite place for excursionists from Whitby, and is 
easily reached by the railway, which runs from Whitby up the main 
dale of Esk as far as the bottom of Goathland dale, and there turns to the 
south to ascend the latter hollow ; and there is a station at GroBmont, the 
site of an old priory, and now the centre of the mining industry of Eskdale, 
which is situated a mile to the east of Egton bridge.

Goathland dale is much the largest of the branch dales of thi3 district. 
At first it is an open moorland glen, surrounded by hills which are consi- 
derably lower than tho Loose hoe and Burton head peaks. Its western 
branch is called Whccldole, and is a rocky sylvan glen, upon the stream 
of which there is a waterfall, called Nelly Ayre fuss, over an edge of sand- 
stone some forty feet in depth. The branch of the stream along which tho 
railway runs is called Ellerbeck, and this also has several easily accessible 
waterfalls upon it, the best known of which, Thomasson's force, is very 
near the top of tho railway incline, from which it is approached up a 
winding rocky glen. The following arc the rarer plants of Goathland dale, 



Equisetum hyemalo

On the drainago ridgo west of Goathland dale Lilhoe cross attains an 
elevation of 1000 feet, at a distance of fivo miles from the sea. From this 
peak an almost unbranched sylvan glen, called Iburndale, runs down to 
the Esk. Its stream is called Littlo beck, and it has a fine waterfall upon 
it, which is called Falling foss, and of which the hard arenaceous Dogger 
beds form the cap rock. These waterfalls of tho branch doles of the Esk 
are all within the compass of a day's excursion from Whitby, and they are 
the only falls of any considerable size which we have on the east of the 
Central Valley. Below Sleights, and where Iburndale opens out, the main 
dale of Esk widens, and the stream curves gradually round towards the 
north. The heather is now left behind, and there are several villages of 
considerable size amongst the undulated ground which margins the stream 
upon both sides as we approach its mouth. At Ruswarp it receives on 
the south the stream of another dale, which penetrates the moors in the 
direction of the Derwent, and winding past pleasant woods, and heights 
diversified by halls and homesteads, it flows beneath the steep craggy banks

We must now go back again to Roseberry Topping, and make the circuit 
of the coast. From Roseberry a line of high moor runs towards the sea 
in a north-eastern direction, with a steep slope towards tho north-west. 
Amongst the undulations of the hill a pleasant stream takes its rise, which 
soon reaches tho foot of the slope, and then flows down a wooded glen, in 
a channel diversified by rock in several places, to fall into the sea at Salt- 
burn. The town of Guisbro' stands upon the banks of the stream at a 
distance of five miles from the sea, and at an elevation above it of not more 
than 100 yards. Immediately in front of the town the moor rises to a 
height of 700 feet above it, the steep slope covered with fir plantations and 
bilberry bushes, and crested by a fine crag of tho freestone of the Lower 
Oolite, which is called Highcliff : and behind thn town the swelling < 
of Eston Nab rise to shut out the view of the lees estuary. The 
plants of tho neighbourhood of Guisbro* are 



Sinapis tcnuifolia 
Geranium sylvatic 
Rubus Guntheri 
Hieracinm tridentatam 
Atriplex littoralis 
Juniperus communis 



EpipactiB ensifolia

From Marske to Saltburn the coast is bounded by banks of sand and 
diluvial clay, which grow higher and higher towards the east, and inland 
are the hall and woods of Upleatham, upon the slope towards the east of 
a rounded hill of Lias, of which the summit is 550 feet above the sea. 
The view from Upleatham of the hollow of tho stream which flows from 
Guisbro' to Saltburn, of the grey old castle of Skelton, and its environing 
woods upon the opposite slope, and of tho village of Brotton and its church 
upon the summit of the bare ridge above, is very fine. From tho Tees 
mouth as far eastward as the Saltburn stream, a beautiful sweep of hard 
sand, which is more or less covered at high water, stretches along the foot

of the sea-bank and sandhills : and west of this rising watering place the 
cliffs begin, to continue with breaks almost till the Esk is reached. The 
following are the rarer plants of the woods and sea-shore in this neighbour- 
hood; 



The streams of that portion of tho coast which we havo now reached 
have their rise amongst the broad surfaces of heatherland which ascend 
from the north bank of the Esk and of which Dauby Beacon is the culmi- 
nating peak. Beginning in heathery glens they soon sink through the 
Oolitic beds, and growing gradually larger as they descend, are often bor- 
dered with thick woods in tho lower part of their course. Upon the sea 
margin, or within a short distance of the coast, there ore in the breaks of 
the hill-country several Tillages of moderate size, partly agricultural and 
partly maritime, with a strong dash interfused of the iron and alum minin g 
element : and between tho gills which contain these streams and woods 
and villages, the spurs of the hill-country stretch out to form along the 
shore-line a series of magnificent precipices, the barriers which guard this 
prominent line of coast, bulwarks which as year follows year, and Summer 
succeeds to Spring, and "Winter to Autumn, in unvaried cycle of repetition, 
the waves of ocean ceaselessly beat against. 

The first crag, Huntcliffe, begins at Saltburn, and forms a prominent 
object in the view from Kedcar and the Tees mouth. The greatest height 
which it reaches is 360 feet, and the lower part is composed of the Lower 
Lias Shale, and the upper part of the hard Ironstone and Marlstone beds, 
tho whole being surmounted by a cap of glacial diluvium. The more 
notable plants of Huntcliffe ore Crambo maritima, Brassica oleracea, Car- 
duus Marianus and Schistidium maritimum. Then comes the Skinningrave 
hollow and the pleasant sylvan stream and glen of Lofthouse, and beyond 
it the great cliff of Boulby, tho loftiest of all the English coast crags. 
This stands boldly out against the sea and is altogether 660 feet in height,

the cap rock being the hard arenaceous beds of the lower Oolite, and the 
lower part shewing an excellent section of the Lias from its latest deposits 
down to a depth of 100 feet in the Lower Shale. Then comes the Staithes 
hollow, with its branched glen, beyond which the coast takes a more deci- 
dedly southern direction than heretofore. By the Staithes fault we have 
the strata depressed so that the Ironstone and Marlstone beds are brought 
down to the shore, and between Staithes and Sandscnd the Oolito every- 
where extends down to the sea cliffs, except at Runswick Bay, the highest 
crag of this part being south of Kettlcness, 370 feet in height. Now that 
the railway runs to Saltburn on the one side, and to Whitby on the other, 
this grand sweep of craggy coast is brought within the range of easy access 
to tourists, and it is to be expected that it will be more visited, and become 
better known than it has been. The tide is often inconvenient for paying 
a visit to the crags from below, and to skirt their upper edge necessitates 
a good deal of rough scrambling, but to those who are able to make it, and 
who care for either magnificent scenery or geology, the walk between 
Saltburn and Wliitby will richly repay the exertion. 

At Sandscnd the cliffs terminate and inland is the Mulgrave hollow, 
penetrating to the Lias, with its two streams and undulated shadowy woods, 
and antique and modern castles. The following are the rarer plants of 
these woods and the adjacent sea-shore ;

From Sandscnd to Whitby the coast is guarded by banks of diluvial 
clay, similar to those which occur between Marske and Saltburn. This is 
the tract of the lowest depression of the strata. The Lias is not anywhere 
to be seen and the Oolito forms the foundation of the sea bank, from the 
base of which extends a beach of sand, the greater part of which is over- 
flowed at high water. The following arc the rarer plants of the sea bank, 
and maritime plants of the shores of the Esk and other places in the neigh- 
bourhood of Whitby;

From the Esk southward the beds rise in the direction of the anticlinal 
axis. Between Whitby and Baytown extends a continuous range of cliffs, 
the highest of which is under 300 feet in altitude. At first the Upper Lias 
Shale occupies the shore, and at Hawsker only a small depth of it is seen, 
and inland we have the calcareous bed of the Lower Oolite over a thick 
mass of its Lower Sandstones and Shales. From this point southward the 
rise in tho beds is sudden. Before Baytown is reached both the two lower 
sets of Liassic beds make their appearance in the cliffs. They sweep round 
the slope of the undulated hollow at the bottom of which the little town 
is situated, overlaid along the shore line at the bottom of tho hollow with 
banks of diluvium. The Peak cliffs, on the south side of the bay, are the 
termination against the coast of the line of high land which forms the ridge 
of watershed between Esk and Derwent. They arc 600 feet in altitude, 
and exhibit lower beds of the Lias than aro to be seen anywhere else in 
North Yorkshire. 

Interesting as it is in respect of scenery and geology, this district is not 
rich botanically. Its hills are not high enough to produce a large number 
of the Montane species. It has only one thin bed of limestone amongst 
a thick mass of shales and sandstones, and its Xcrophilous plants aro few 
in number and rare. Its shore lino is guarded mostly by steep and crum- 
bling cliffs, upon which very few of the characteristically Maritime species 
grow. It docs not contain within its limits any low-lying level country, 
and for the Rarer Ascending species is considerably under the average of 
the districts. It is richest in the ericctal and sylvc6tral flowering plants 
and mosses which affect low hilly tracts.

CHAPTER XI. 

HO. 3. THB DEB WENT DISTRICT. 

This district contains upwards of one fourth part of the whole of North 
Yorkshire, and is upwards of five hundred square miles in area, so that it 
is one half the size of an average English county. It has a sea-line which 
is sixteen miles in length from north to south, and from the coast to the 
watershed ridge ou the west the distance is forty miles. Physically it 
consists of five tracts of country as follows ; 

1. The Eugeogenout hills. These are a range of undulated hills which 
extend southward from the watershed ridge which separates the tributary 
branches of Derwent from those of the Esk and Tees, and which, with the 
dales that intersect it, fills up the whole of the northern portion of the dis- 
trict. A line may he drawn for nearly forty miles from west to east along 
the ridge of these uncultivated moorlands, hut from north to south the total 
breadth of this range is under ten miles. Like the Cleveland hills, they 
consist of Lower Oolitic strata based upon Lias. The dales are compara- 
tively broad and open, and their streams run from north to south. As has 
been already stated, the culminating peak of the main ridge is the hill 
(Burton head) from which branches of the Esk, Leven and Derwent all 
flow. This is distant 25 miles from the point of coast which is due east 
of it, and in an eastern direction from Burton head the ridge declines, at 
first gradually, and afterwards more suddenly, in altitude, being 880 feet 
lower against the coast than in the summit-peak, which gives an average 
declination of 35 feet per mile. The ridges which divide the dales are in 
some cases almost as high as the main ridge, as will be explained when we 
come to speak of the dales in detail. This tract margins the coast from 
the anticlinal axis southward as far as Scarbro' , which is fully three-fourths 
of the total sea-line of the district

NORTH YORKSHIRE. 



2. The Dysgeogenous hilk. These are a range of calcareous hills which are 
somewhat lower in altitude than those which have been already mentioned, 
and which extend from the coast at Scarbro' westward as far as the water- 
shed of the district in that direction. They are due south of the hills of 
the eugeogenous range, and based upon their slope, with usually a steep 
escarpment towards the north, and a gradual slope in the direction of the 
low level country which borders them on the south. In breadth from north 
to south they vaiy from four to ten miles. The streams which take their 
rise amongst the northern range have to run through that of which we are 
now speaking before they reach the Derwent. These hills are usually 
much drier and more grassy than the others, the slopes of those parts of 
the dales which they enclose being steep, and often covered with dense 
woods. This range is also highest towards its western extremity, and grows 
gradually lower as we pass eastward. It margins with low cliffs the greater 
part of the coast from Scarbro' southward to Filey. 

3. The Vale of Pickering. This is a tract of flat low-lying cultivated 
country on the south of the calcareous bills, which extends from the coast 
inland for thirty miles. A large proportion of it is not elevated so much 
as 100 feet above the sea-level, and the vale is much intersected by streams, 
and contains a considerable surface of carrs and low marsh-land. The 
Derwent runs through it from east to west, and forms the boundary of 
North Yorkshire on the south : and upon that side the Vale is bounded by 
the Chalk Wolds of the East Biding. "With the exception of Scarbro', all 
the towns of the drainage district arc either actually in this tract or very 
near the edge of it. 

4. The Howard i an tract. This comprises two narrow parallel terraces, 
which extend from the calcareous bi11Â« eastward to the Derwent, and which 
are situated on the south-west of the Vale of Pickering, and separate it from 
the great Central Vale of York. The northern terrace is composed of the 
calcareous rocks of the Lower Oolite, and its highest point is under 400 
feet above the sca-levcl : the southern one of Lower Oolite based upon Lias ; 
and its highest point is under 600 feet : and both of them decline gradually 
in elevation from north-west to south-east. 

5. South of the Howardian tract the district contains a small portion 
of the great Central Vale. 

We will take the coast-line first, and then the hill country and the dales, 
proceeding in order from east to west. 

From the High Peak southward as far as Hayburn Wyke we have a 
grand range of cliffs, which between these two points, a distance of four

miles, sinks in altitude from 595 to 296 feet above high water mark. 
These precipices shew a complete series of the beds of rock from the Lower 
Oolite down to the Lower Lias Shale. At Haybnrn Wyke is the month 
of a secluded branched glen from the west and north-west, which is called 
Staintondale. Fast Cloughton and Scalby the cliffs are lower, and the beds 
dip rapidly in a southern direction. At Cloughton Wyke the calcareous 
band of the Lower Oolite occupies the shore. At Scalby is the mouth of 
another little stream, which is connected with the Derwent by what is 
called the New Cut. Towards Scarbro' the Upper Sandstones of the Lower 
Oolite, with diluvium over them, form a cliff of under 200 feet in height. 
The Castle hill at Scarbro' is composed of an outlying mass of the hard 
calcareous rocks of the Middle Oolite, which form here a bold rocky pro- 
montory, which rises to a height of 300 feet, and stands out abruptly 
against the sea, and has the sea flowing round three-fourths of its circum- 
ference. The town of Scarbro' is situated upon the low diluvial sea-bank 
which this promontory guards, and inland from it extends the lowest ground 
which we have upon this line of coast, and a calcareous nab, called Oliver's 
Mount, rises abruptly from this low ground to a height of 510 feet, with 
a steep escarpment towards the north, and with what was once a sedgy 
mere at its base, but which is now greatly reduced by drainage. The 
following are the rarer plants of the shores, the slopes and cliffs of tho 
Castle hill, and other places in this neighbourhood ;

Oliver's Mount is an outlying spur of the calcareous range. Between 
Scarbro' and Filey the highest point of the cliff is under 300 feet above 
high- water mark. From Scarbro' as far as Ewe Nab the Upper Sandstones 
of the Lower Oolite form the greater part of the cliff, and the calcareous 
band may be seen beneath them in several places. By a landslip in Cay t on 
Bay we have the Oxford Clay brought down to the shore and over it there 
is a cliff of Calcareous Gritstone. North of the Redcliff fault we have all 
the beds of the Lower Oolite from the Lower Calcareous Gritstone down to 
the Kelloways Sandstone. South of the fault in Gristhorp cliffs we have 
a foundation of Lower Oolite, and above it a cliff of Middle Oolite, with 
the beds from the earliest deposit up to tho same Lower Calcareous Gritstone. 
From this point the beds dip rapidly towards the south, the Calcareous 
Gritstone descending to the shore-levtl to form tho conspicuous rocky pro- 
montory which bears the name of Filey Brig. 

Tho main stream of Derwent is made up of numerous branches which 
rise amongst the heathery arenaceous moors a few miles inland from the 
coast, about midway between Whitby and Scarbro'. From the great Peak 
cliff, the head of its eastern branch is not distant more than two miles. 
The summit peaks which surround it range in height from about 800 feet 
on the east side to about 1000 feet on the west of the broad undulated 
heathery hollow down which the stream flows in a mainly southern direc- 
tion. The principal dale bears the name of Harwood dale. Opposite 
Cloughton is the escarpment towards the north of the tabular calcareous 
range of hills, which attains a height of 633 feet in Suffield moor and 714 
feet in Hackness moor. This mass of hill is penetrated by numerous digi- 
tated glens, with steep wooded embankments. Beneath the western edge 
of the escarpment of Hackness moor the stream flows beneath Barnescliffe 
down sylvan Langdale, its opposite bank guarded by a narrow calcareous 
ridge, which bears the name of Langdale Rigg- At the bottom of Langdale 
it receives a considerable affluent from the arenaceous moors on the north-

west, which runs for several miles at the foot of the calcareous es- 
carpment, which from Hackness moor sweeps round towards the west ; 
and here also it is joined by two smaller streams from the recesses of the 
same limestone hill, the glens of which are called Deepdale and Troutsdale. 
With calcareous hills rising steeply above it upon both sides, it flows past 
the village of Hackness, and down the beautiful thickly- wooded glen called 
Forge valley, through the main mass of the calcareous range into the Vale 
of Pickering. The following are the rarer plants of the wooded glens and

Through the Vale of Pickering the course of the Derwent is almost due 
west. At the point where it turns in a western direction, a small stream 
joins it from the east, which is called the Hertford river, and which rises 
not far from the coast near Filey, and flows for about Ave miles through 
low marshy ground down the hollow between the Chalk and the Limestone. 
West of Forge Valley are three small wooded glens in the limestone range, 
which are called Yedmandale, Beedale, and Sawdondale. The next dale 
to the main dale of Derwent which penetrates through the southern to the 
northern range of hills is called Newtondale. The head of this dale joins

the head of Goathland dale, and the Whitby and Pickering railway runs 
along the depression which is thus obtained, from Pickering np Newton- 
dale, over the watershed ridge, which at this point is under 200 yards in 
elevation, and then down Goathland dale in the direction of Whitby. 
Newtondale at its upper part is a steep, narrow, heathery gill, its side* 
crested in some places with edges of arenaceous crag. On the east of it 
Lilla Cross attains 1000 feet, and west of it several of the arenaceous peaks 
are between 800 and 900 feet in elevation. The calcareous range of hills 
is considerably broader between Hackness and Newtondale than it is a 
little further westward, and the highest part of its table-land is here 882 
feet above the sea-level. A small branch glen which is deeply excavated 
in this plateau, and which is called the Hole of Horcum, is well known 
to botanists as a station for Cornus succica, a Montane plant, which south 
of the Scotch Highlands, is known only in this tract, and amongst the 
Cheviots. The town of Pickering stands upon the banks of the Newton- 
dale stream, just where it leaves the limestone. A copious spring, at a 
place called Keld heads, situated on the edge of the limestone west of 
Pickering, furnishes the source of the Costa, which flows southward through 
the valley and joins the Pickering stream and the Bye not far from where 
the latter falls into the Derwent. And east of Newtondale and the Hole of 
Horcum is a glen called Thornton dale, which, like the Hole of Horcum, 
does not penetrate beyond the limestone ; and the stream of which flows 
into the Derwent before the Bye reaches it. Besides the Cornus, the 
following are the more interesting plants of Newtondale and the neigh- 
bourhood of Pickering;

anticlinal ridge which runs from Burton head eastward to the Peak cliff. 
The summits amongst which they take their rise, proceeding along the 
ridge from east to west, are as follows : Wheeldale hoe, 1043 feet; Shun- 
nor hoc, 1085 feet; Loose hoe, 1419 feet; Ralph Gross, 1409 feet; Wes- 
terdale moor, 1422 feet; and Burton head, 1489 feet; and digitations of 
hill which attain the Middle Zone stretch out for several miles southward 
between the dales. Of the three, Rosedale is the broadest and most popu- 
lous, Brantsdale the least so. In Rosodalo the ironstone of the Lower 
Oolite is now extensively quarried. It is conveyed to the Cleveland blast- 
furnaces by a line of railway which runs across the top of the moor from 
the mines to the head of the southern fork of the Levcn. The streams of 
the three dales are called the Seven, the Dove, and the Bran. Each of 
them runs in a distinct dale through the calcareous range, which every- 
where presents towards the north a steep escarpment, and is here not more 
than from two to four miles in breadth from north to south. The town of 
Kirby-moorside is situated upon the southern edge of the limestone not 
far from the Farndale stream. Kirkdale, celebrated for its cavern, is the 
lower part of the dale of the Bran where it breaks through the calcareous 
hills. Higher up this is called Sleightholme dale, and nowhere in the 
district have we a finer sweep of aborginal wood than extends along the 
slopes of this stream, whilst from Sleightholme dale round the escarpment 
towards the north as far westward as Bilsdale stretches a continuous belt 
of larch plantations. From the Vale of Pickering the view up any of 
these wooded hollows of the wide extent of bleak moorland is very fine. 
Next comes Riccaldale, which does not penetrate far north of the calcareous 
range. The main stream of Rye rises amongst the northern moorlands, at 
a very short distance from the high escarpment which overlooks the Cleve- 
land valley, and a western branch rises not far from the escarpment which 
overlooks the great Central Yale. Bilsdale is a fine deep dale with high 
peaks between the ramified glens which branch from it at its northern 
extremity, and has its sides crested in some places by edges of freestone. 
Snailesworth, the western glen, is a broad, much branched, undulated 
hollow, which is separated only by a high ridge from the low country 
which sweeps round the edge of this moorland tract. Between Snailes- 
worth and Bilsdale there is a narrow heathery glen, which is called 
Ladhill gill : and at Hawnby the three streams unite together to form the 
main branch of the Rye. The following are the more interesting plants of 
these three last-mentioned dales;

Opposite the bottom of Bilsdale on the east and due north of Helmsley, 
the calcareous range attains 1078 feet. From Helmsley in this direction 
runs up the pleasant sylvan glen which is described in detail at page 76. 
From the point where its three branches unite together, which is just ten 
miles distant from the head of Bilsdale, the Rye flows in a southern direc- 
tion down a steep-banked, thickly wooded dale, through the calcareous 
range, past Rievaulx Abbey, and beneath Buncombe Park and Lord Fever- 
sham's woods and hall to Helmsley, where it enters the Vale of Pickering. 
The view from the terrace at Rievaulx of the ruins of the choir and refec- 
tory of the fine old Cistercian abbey, and the cottages which surround it, 
and the branching calcareous glens with thick woods upon their slopes, 
and bright green meadows by the side of the streams beneath, and of the 
heathery table-land of the Hambleton hills beyond, is well worth a climb 
to see ; and, although the height of the stand-point is little above two 
hundred yards, yet the steepness of the hill-banks give the scene a well- 
marked montane aspect- The southern portion of the space between the 
three branch dales of Rye is occupied by two outlying elephant-shaped 
nabs of limestone, of which that on the cast, which is called Easterside, 
attains a height of 1048 feet. On the slope of the other is placed the pictu- 
resque little village of Hawnby, a centre from which, in each direction, 
long lines of steep sylvan hill-bank a radiate. From Hawnby the escarp- 
ment of the calcareous range sweeps round towards the north-west in the 
direction of Ardcn and Hambleton End. From north to south the Ham- 
bleton hills are about ten miles in length, the ridge of watershed, which 
from north to south sinks from nearly 1300 to 950 feet, being only a very 
short distance from their western edge, and the slope from it in the direc- 
tion of the hills which overhang the Rye being very gradual. Several

glens branch from the Rye in a western direction to penetrate these hills, 
lonely little dales crested with rock at their upper parts, and lower down 
their embankments, like those of the main dale of Rye, covered with wood. 
The principal of these branch glens are called Ardendale, Yowlasdale, 
Nettledale, and Flazendalc, and in a smaller one at Rainton heights, near 
Hawnby, there is a fine precipice of Calcareous Gritstone, about fifty feet 
in depth. Opposite Hood-hill the line which bounds the hill-country turns 
abruptly towards the east, and there is now a steep embankment crested 
with limestone which faces the south, and is continued past Amplcforth 
(849 feet), and Oswaldkirk (544 feet), sloping gradually in an eastern 
direction till it sinks into the Yale of Pickering. The following are the

From Helmsley through the Vale of Pickering the Bye flows in a south- 
eastern direction towards the Derwent. Seven miles from Helmsley it 
receives the united Brantsdale and Farndale streams ; in three miles more 
that from Hosedalc ; and not far from its union with the Derwent the Costa 
joins it. From the point where the Eye joins it, tho Derwent flows towards 
the southwest, till it becomes upon both sides a river of the East Riding. 
Upon the bank and in the neighbourhood of the river, from the junction 
downwards past Malton, several interesting Hygrophilous plants are to be 
met with, of which the following are the most noteworthy ;

The Howardian tract is separated on the north-west from the range of 
the calcareous hills over Ampleforth and Oswaldkirk by the hollow along 
which runs the Thirsk and Malton railway. The southern of its two 
terraces, that which is composed of sandstone, is during part of its course, 
the watershed between Foss and Derwent Beginning at the north-western 
extremity, we have tho park and hall of Newburgh upon its slope towards 
the railway, and the moors of Yearsley and Oulston upon the summit of 
the ridge, which, at this point, is nearly 600 feet in elevation. A few 
miles further east are the park of Wiganthorp, and the moor of Scakleton, 
below which rises a stream which flows on the south side of the ridge past 
the villages of Bulmer and Foston-le-clay to the Derwent. Mowthorpe 
dale is a small wooded glen where a branch of this stream penetrates the 
ridge. Then comes the village of Terrington and the woods and park 
and mansion of Castle Howard. The ridge at this point is not more than 
300 feet in elevation, and it declines still more past Whitwell, Welburn, 
and Crambeck, in the direction of the Derwent. 

The northern of the two terraces, that which is composed of calcareous 
materials, runs parallel with the other, but is not continued so far west- 
ward. On the south it has a steep escarpment, which in many places is 
covered with wood, but on the north its slope towards the Vale of Pickering 
is more gradual. At Gilling the sylvan nab which forms the termination 
of the ridge in a western direction, stands out boldly against the hollow 
along which the railway runs. At Hovingham and Slingsby two streams

from the arenaceous terrace break through the limestone, and upon the 
slope of the ridge towards the north the two villages are situated. "Wath 
wood, Slingsby wood, Coneysthorp wood, and Hildenley wood, are all upon 
the escarpment of this ridge towards the south : and Terrington Carr, well 
known as a botanical locality, is a small heathery swamp, by the side of 
the Slingsby stream, in the trough between the two terraces. The town 
of Mai ton is situated upon the slope towards the Vale of Pickering of the 
calcareous ridge, upon the north bank of the Derwent. This Howardian 
tract furnishes a great variety of situation, and although it has none of the 
more decidedly Montane plants, yet we obtain here as many of the rarer 
species as are to bo found anywhere in North Yorkshire within an equal 
area with the exception of Upper Teesdale, as the following list of its

West of the Bulmcr stream there is an outlying wooded hill capped with 
Lower Oolite, at Stittenham, but it is under 300 feet in height. A narrow 
tract of Lias occupies the slope in the direction of the Central Valley of 
the southern Howardian terrace. In the Central Valley the Derwent flows 
due south till it leaves the Biding. Buttercrambc moor is a low wooded 
heath, of the same kind as several which come within the district drained 
by the Foss. Here grow Carduus pratensis, Cladium Mariscus, Polypodium 
Phegopteris and Lastrea Thelypteris. At Stamford Bridge the river enters 
the East Riding.

considerably the largest flora. In Montane plants it is above all the other 
districts of the eastern subprovince, but below each of the three hilly dis- 
tricts of the west. For Xerophilons plants it is on a par with the Yore 
and "West Swale districts, and amongst the thick woods and grassy banks 
of its calcareous hills many of the more interesting plants of this category 
grow plentifully. In Maritime plants it is not rich, especially when the 
length of its coast-line is considered. The Vale of Pickering furnishes a 
large number of Hygrophilous species, and for Rarer Ascending plants this 
district stands highest of the nine.

CHAPTER XII. 



No. 2. THE EAST SWALE DISTRICT. 

This district, like that of East Tees, consists of an edge of the eastern 
moorlands, a tract of undulated country underlaid by liassic strata which 
sweeps round their base, and beyond the Lias about one half of its total 
area is comprised in the great Central Valley : but in this case the line of 
the embankment of the moorlands runs north and south, and this district, 
unlike that of East Tees, has no coast line. Here also, as in East Tees, 
the watershed is only a very short distance from the edge of the hill, and 
no dales of any considerable size which belong to the district penetrate to 
the moorland mass, and the slope from a height of 900 or 1000 feet down to 
300 feet is very sudden. 

The western boundary of the district is formed by the Wiske till it joins 
the Swale, and afterwards by the latter river. The less elevated part of 
the district is often called the Vale of Mowbray. The Mowbray family 
were its ancient feudal lords, and the district as here denned is almost 
identical with the tract to which Mr. Grainge's book, which bears the title 
of "Tho Vale of Mowbray," refers. The principal stream which runs 
through it is called Codbeck. The hills which form its watershed on the 
east are the two ranges which run through the Derwent district from west 
to cast, and terminate against tho sea coast, as has just been explained. 

First we will take the hill embankment, and afterwards the low country. 
The Codbeck and the Wiske both rise in the same glen, which is situated 
at the north-west corner of the great mass of the hills. This glen is called 
Scarth Nick, and is a bare, bleak, treeless hollow, with the Wiske issuing 
from it at the north end, and Codbeck in an opposite direction. On the 
west of this glen is a steep narrow ridge, on the slope of which, towards 
the low country, arc the woods of Arncliffc, and the ruins of the priory of

Mount Grace. The moors above Osmothcrley arc lower both than the 
arenaceous hills further west, and the calcareous range on the south. They 
are much undulated by the heathery glens in which run the branches of 
Codbeck and the Bye, the summit of the watershed ridge being here 1048 
feet above the sea-level. Above Silton a spur of the arenaceous range 
stands out into the low country, and behind it is Black Hambleton (1289 
feet), which is at onco the highest point, and the termination in a western 
direction of the escarpment towards the north of the calcareous range. 
Opposite Kepwick and behind a round outlying mass of hill, called Kep- 
wick Nab, is a bleak undulated hollow, shut in by moors upon three sides, 
in which a branch of Codbeck takes its rise. Above Kirby Knowle and 
Boltby another spur of arenaceous hill spreads out westward and south- 
westward from the main range. Above Kirby Knowle this moor is 880 
feet in height, and has a craggy crest, and a little tarn in a hollow, formed 
by a landslip, upon its slope. In front of Boltby the moor is somewhat 
higher, and has a steep embankment, covered with fir plantations : and 
the escarpment, still capped with Lower Oolite, but much lower than 
Boltby Moor in elevation, is continued still further in a south-western 
direction, as far as Feliskirk and Mount Saint John, from which point it 
declines gradually into the low country. The main body of this rounded 
spur of hill is called Black Moor, from which on the north-west Wool Moor 
or Knayton Moor is separated only by a narrow glen. In tho hollow 
between Black Moor and the main range another branch of Codbeck takes 
its rise, the two branch glens of which open out at the village of Boltby. 
The western of these is the most interesting, a deep, boggy, heathery, and 
wooded hollow, which is called Gurtof gill ; to which, in times past, the 
members of our Thirsk Natural History Society have often resorted for 
Mosses, and Oak and Beech Fern. 

Above Kepwick and Black Moor the calcareous table-land reaches a 
height of from 1100 to 1200 feet. From Boltby to where opposite Hood 
hill it turns abruptly due east, the continuity of the hill-bank is unbroken. 
The distance in a direct line is about four miles, but it is much more if the 
windings of the edge of the embankment are followed. This portion of 
the great calcareous range is called tho Hambleton hills. In elevation it 
declines gradually from north to south from 1100 to 950 feet, but the 
embankment is so steep that these hills, as viewed from Thirsk, look much 
higher than they are in reality. The Calcareous Gritstone which crests 
the embankment forms fine precipices at three places, one above Boltby, 
the second opposite Thirsk, and the third at the southern extremity of the

escarpment These are called Boltby Scarr, Whitstonclift', and llolston 
Scarr. Whitstonclift 7 especially is a noble crag. It measures fully one 
hundred feet in sheer perpendicular depth, and beneath it, as at Boltby and 
Rolston, the embankment slopes steeply for five hundred feet, and is 
thickly strewn with fallen fragments of the summit cliff. At the foot of 
this slope we have the only considerable tarn of these East Yorkshire hills. 
It is called Gormirc, and is about three-quarters of a mile in circumference, 
with on the east the embankment of the main mass of hill rising steeply 
from its shore, and on the other three sides a high ridge of arenaceous hill 
sweeping round it. There are no streams except the mere runnels of the 
hill-bank which flow into it, and none flow from it : so that its waters arc 
mainly supplied by rain, and diminished by evaporation. From the summit 
of Whitstoncliff the view upon a clear day is very fine and extensive.* 
Immediately beneath is the precipice and the lake, and the steep embank- 
ment, covered with thickets of Brake and Blackthorn, and thickly strewn 
with fallen piles, confusedly upheaped, of massive and angular rocks. From 
Boltby Moor southward to Hood hill, a pleasant undulated wooded tract 
extends, and beyond the broad central valley is spread out like a map from 
the Tees southward as far as York, with Thirsk and Ripon marked con- 
spicuously, and the lines of railway easily traceable by the smoke of passing 
and repassing trains. And beyond stretch the western moors, the huge 
bulk of Penhill looming in front to shut in Wensleydalc like a barrier, and 
tho higher Great Whernsidc peak, on the south of it, for a focus from 
which the undulated lines of hill stretch north and south till they are lost 
to view in misty distance. The following are the rarer plants of Gormirc, 
and of tho hill embankment from Scarth Nick southward to llolston 
Scar; 

â€¢ This is tho locality of the following sonnet of Wordsworth's ; 

" Dark and more dark the shades of evening fell ; â€¢ 
The wished-for point waarcach'd, hut late the hour, 
And little could be fraincd from all that dower 
Of prospect, whereof many thousands tell ;

Substantially expressed, a place for bell

With groTcs that never were imagined lay Â»

Of silent rapture : but we felt the while 
We should forget them : they are of the Bky, 
And from our earthly memory fade sway."

Opposite the south western corner of the calcareous range is an outlying 
nab, capped with limestone, which is called Hood hill, and which is nearly 
as high as the adjacent part of the main mass of moorland. Upon three 
sides it has an abrupt wood-covered slope, and in a southern direction 
declines more gradually. The escarpment of the calcareous range towards 
the Bouth, from Rolston Scarr westward over Kilburn and Coxwold, is 
almost as abrupt as the slope which faces west. This portion of the calca- 
reous plateau is between 800 and 900 feet, and the bank is mostly covered 
with woods. A small branch of the Swale takes its rise upon this embank- 
ment, but its glens do not penetrate far into the recesses of the hill-country. 
Cockerdale is a pleasant wooded rocky hollow, and two other branches of 
the same stream rise, one of them in Wass woods, and the other upon tho 
southern slope of Hood hill. The ruins of Byland Abbey stand in the low 
ground at the foot of Wass Bank, and the extremity of the arenaceous Ho - 
wardian terrace forms here the watershed of this district upon the south- 
east. The hall and fishpond of Ncwburgh are pleasantly situated in the 
midst of an extensive park upon the slope of the terrace in this direction, 
and still further west upon the same slope is the village of Husthwaite,

We must now bid farewell to the hill-bank and turn to the low-country. 
Of all the streams of North Yorkshire the Wiske is the most sluggish, and 
has the least deeply-excavated stream channel. It usually is more liko a 
broad ditch than a typical North Yorkshire rivulet. From Scarth Nick 
its course is at first north-west, and afterwards due west through the low 
country for ten miles, and then it turns abruptly to the south, and runs for 
fifteen miles in that direction before it joins the Swale. Upon the banks 
of a small branch of the Wiske, not far from the eastern edge of the 
Central Valley, stands the town of Northallerton, the central town of the 
North Riding, and the place where its sessions are held, and its gaol is 
situated. This town is about six miles distant from the nearest point of 
the hills, and in its neighbourhood, within the bounds of this drainage 
district the following plants occur ;

The course of Codbeck, from the Osmotherley end of Scarth Nick until 
it joins the Swale, is south-westward through, or not far from, the undu- 
lated liassic tract which margins the hill-country, the total length of the 
stream being about twenty-five miles. Opposite Northallerton it is mar- 
gined on the east by the woods of Cotcliffe, which extend for about two 
miles along the slope of a bank of the liassic shale, the summit of which 
is about 400 feet in height above the stream, and at the south end of this 
bank the sandstone of the Lower Oolite just shews itself. A considerable 
slip of land has recently taken place here, a part of the wood having glided 
down so gradually that the trees and brushwood which compose it are not 
destroyed : and over the site of what a few years ago was a grassy meadow 
by the side of the stream, there is now a steep, broken, wood-covered, 
clayey bank. We havo here an instance, upon a small scale, of the same 
kind of landslip that has occured at Kirby Knowle upon a much larger 
scale within the memory of man, and upon a much larger scale still at 
Gormire, at a period which is perhaps as far back as the great glacial 
inundation. At Brawith, Codbeck is increased by the stream which rises 
near Kepwick, and soon afterwards it is joined by a rivulet from Kirby 
Knowle and Mount Saint John. The town of Thirsk is situated upon the 
banks of Codbeck, upon the eastern edge of the Central Valley and at a 
distance of five miles due west of Whitstoncliff. Upon the east of the town 
the liassic slope attains 200 feet within a mile of it, and this altitude of 
surface is almost or quite maintained till the foot of the hill-bank is reached. 
The Boltby stream flows in a south-western direction past Sutton-under- 
"WhitstonclifF and Bagby, and falls into Codbeck at Gristhwaite, and soon 
afterwards the latter pours its waters into the Swale. The following are 
the more interesting plants of the low country in the neighbourhood of 
Thirsk;

The Coxwold stream runs in a south-western direction past Husthwaite 
and Birdforth, and falls into the Swale a short distance below the mouth 
of Codbeck. 

In this district the Middle Oolite forms the surface of the Hambleton 
plateau from Black Hambleton southward to the escarpment over Coxwold 
and Wass, and is also the cap rock of Hood hill. At Whitstoncliff the 
series is 200 feet in thickness, the Coralline Oolite forming the summit of 
the table-land, the Lower Calcareous Gritstone the great cliff, and the 
Kelloways Sandstone the ferruginous crags, which are exposed at from 50 
to 100 feet below it, at the summit of the steep sandy slope. The Lower 
Oolite forms the surface of Osmotherley moors, and sinks beneath the calca-

reous range, to reappear on the south of it. At Whitstoncliff the summit 
of this series is 850 feet above the sea-level, and its thickness 600 feet. 
In the Coxwold hollow it occupies the low ground and the summit of the 
ridge on the south, and a spur stretches out westward in the direction of 
Carlton Husthwaite and Thirkleby. The calcareous band is worked for 
lime in several places. The Upper Lias Shale was formerly worked for 
Alum and Jet at Thimbleby, and has recently been worked for Jet in 
CotclifFe wood. 

For Montane plants this district is the second of the four hilly districts 
of the east. It has only a mere edge of limestone hill, and in Xerophilous 
species is not rich, neither are those which do occur plentiful. The low 
grounds from Thirsk and Northallerton westward to the "Wiskc and Swale 
produce a considerable number of Hygrophilous species, especially the vici- 
nity of the first-mentioned stream : and for Rarer Ascending species this 
district is only below the more extensive districts of "West Swale and 
Derwent.

CHAPTER XIII 



NO. 1. THE OU8E AND FOSS DISTRICT. 

This district and the Ainsty are the only two of our nine drainage dis- 
tricts which do not include within their limits any hills of the Middle 
zone, and this district, next to the Ainsty, is the smallest of the nine. 
The greater part of it was included in the royal forest of Galtres, which 
was kept for the purpose of a royal hunting ground almost in an aboriginal 
state from the time of tho Saxons down to the year 1670, when an act of 
parliament was obtained, and the forest broken up and enclosed. Only a 
small portion of the watershed of the district on the north-east is above 
one hundred yards in deration, and fully one half of its surface is within 
one hundred feet of tho sea-level. 

The Ouse, which is now a river of large size, forms the boundary of the 
district on the south-west, and the Foss and a smaller stream called the 
Kyle run through it from the north-east in that direction. Both these two 
latter take their rise upon the slope of the arenaceous Howardian terrace 
at its highest end, which is the point of watershed between Foss, Swale, 
and Derwent. The wooded slope of the terrace at Yearsley, and the steep 
wooded glen at the bottom of which are the Foss reservoirs, and the uncul- 
tivated heaths of the upper part of the ridgo above them have something 
of a montane aspect : and from an elevation of nearly 200 yards on Yearsley 
moor there is a fine view down the glen to tho "Wolds in the distance, and 
towards the south-west of the ridge upon which Crayke Castle stands, and 
the wide sweep of low country, in the direction of York, beyond it. The 
following are the more interesting plants which grow here ; 

Ranunculus floribundus Filago minima 



Teesdalia nudicaulis 
Cerastium semidecandrum 
Spergularia rubra 
Sedum Telephium

A broad surface of undulated clayey country, underlaid by Lias, sweeps 
round the south-west of the terrace. Through this tract both the streams 
flow during the early part of their course, and out of it rises the hill of 
Crayke Castle (400 feet), which, like the terrace, is capped with Oolitic 
Sandstone. In the midst of the liassic tract, about midway between the 
two streams, the town of Easingwold is situated, and it includes several 
villages of considerable size. The south-western half of the district 
belongs to the Central Valley, and is populated but thinly. The soil is 
principally sandy, and there are several carrs, and plantations of fir-trees 
and tracts of uncultivated, boggy heatherland. Of these last, Pilmoor, by 
the side of the railway, upon the edge of the district which is nearest the 
Swale, and the commons or "forests" of Stockton and Strensall are the 
principal. The following are the rarer plants which grow upon these two 
last-mentioned heaths, along with several mosses and other plants which 
are rare in the Central Valley ;

In its course through the central valley portion of the district the Foss 
is a slowly-flowing stream with low banks, much resembling the Wiske in 
character, although considerably larger in sire. The Wiske, the Foss, and 
the Derwent in its course through the Vale of Pickering, are the only 
typical valley streams which we have in North Yorkshire, and it is about 
these that the Hygrophilous plants principally cluster. The following are 
the rarer plants of what are called the Foss islands, a small piece of boggy 
ground which is intersected by ditches, near the junction of the stream

the north-west of the city ;

This district has the smallest flora of the nine. The Montane and 
Xcrophilous category are in it but nominally represented, and the Maritime 
category not at all. In the low grounds the Hygrophilous category is well 
represented. The clayey soils of the Lias, and the sandy soils of tho Cen- 
tral Valley, do not furnish a great variety of situation, and the number of 
its Rarer Ascending species is below the average of the districts.

Our knowledge in detail of the character and mode of operation of the 
agencies which have been employed to bring about the distribution of plants 
and animals over the surface of the earth, and thus to produce the condition 
of things which at the present time we behold, is very limited indeed. 
Which are trot species, which aboriginally distinct, and which mere modi- 
fications of one common stock produced by the influence of mere change 
of circumstance, this point it is impossible for us to determine with cer- 
tainty with regard to what appear to us now as truly distinct species, and 
are described as such in our handbooks. We cannot sail backward along 
the stream of time, and unravel the intricacies of their bygone genealogies. 
We are obliged, for practical purposes, to take them as we find them ; to 
describe or receive as species all those associations of an indefinite number 
of plants and animals which we observe to possess in common what we 
agree to consider sufficiently well-marked permanent characteristics ; the 
difference between the so-called analysts and synthesists of descriptive 
zoology and botany really amounting to no more than this, that whilst 
both are agreed in the theoretic idea that the individuals of a species should 
possess permanent characteristics in common, yet when it comes to the 
carrying out of the idea into practice, the latter insist upon more decidedly

marked diagnostic characters, that is to say, upon broader lines of demar- 
cation than the former. And hence arises the fact, that species as described 
in books are often combinations of very unequal value, and that, especially 
in what are called critical genera, such as Rosa, Rubus, Hieracium, Salix, 
and Viola, a series of forms which one author will include under a single 
species only, another author will subdivide and separate amongst a consi- 
derable number. 

And as it is with our knowledge of the genealogy of species, so it is 
with our knowledge of the character and mode of operation of the agencies 
which have been employed to bring about their diffusion. Except in those 
cases where the spreading abroad of species has manifestly been effected by 
human agency, operating either in a direct or in an indirect manner, we 
are almost entirely in the dark as to how they have reached the places 
where we now see them. We cannot tell which are true aboriginal species. 
We cannot tell whether each true aboriginal species was in its original 
creation represented by a single individual, or a pair of individuals, or by 
an indefinite number of individuals, or pairs ; neither, even if wo choose 
to assume the latter to be the case, are we in a position to say to what 
extent the facts which relate to species dispersion have been brought about 
at a period coincident with or posterior to the date of their original creation. 

Rut although our ignorance is so great, and our chance of diminishing 
it so small, when in treating of the distribution of species we consider the 
active agencies by which their diffusion has been brought about, yet when 
we come to speak of the agencies which have operated to restrict their 
distribution the case is different. Each species, we can say with confidence, 
is plainly limited in its distribution by certain physical conditions ; and if 
wo seek out in detail what the physical conditions which accompany the 
distribution of a species are, we are placed in a position in which we can 
form something of an estimate as to which of those conditions have upon 
the distribution an essential bearing. * 

The influence of human agency in modifying a flora. In viewing the flora 
of any definite distric t, as we have it at the present time, it is needful, if 
we would wish to inquire respecting its geographical relations, that we 
Bhould in the first place observe carefully, and having observed, should 
bear in mind constantly, to what extent, and in what way human agency 
has been brought to bear upon it. In any long-settled, long-cultivated 
tract of country, the modification which has been brought about by human 
agency is, of necessity, very considerable. Around the spot where man 
fixes his dwelling, swamps, moors and woods disappear, to make way for

cultivated fields, roads and gardens ; aboriginal species characteristically 
paludal, uliginal, ericetal, and sylvestral, become more or less restricted in 
their range, or are exterminated altogether ; and the places which they 
occupied arc filled up by the species which man cultivates, and the weeds 
which these bring in their train. Thus not only is the natural range of 
the plants indigenous to the country very much interfered with, but inter- 
spersed amongst them, and side by side with them, we sec growing wild a 
host of importations, more or less firmly settled down, the lino between 
which and tho genuine natives it is often very difficult to draw in detail 
with a firm hand. 

In treating of the characteristics of our three climatic zones, indications 
have already been given of the heights up to which, in the country upon 
which we are engaged, the various manifestations and results of human 
agency interfere with and modify the natural condition of its surface. Tho 
Upper Zone remains almost in its aboriginal state. The Middle Zone has 
been comparatively little interfered with, and although a considerable part 
of it is enclosed, yet houses, cultivated fields, gardens and planted woods 
occupy only a very small proportion of the surface which it includes, and 
only a very small proportion of the introduced plants extend their range 
into its limits. But although in the Lower Zone a considerable extent of 
the surface still remains as heatherland, and a little as aboriginal woodland, 
yet in the remainder of this zone, and especially throughout tho vales and 
low country, the case is very different : for not only do the fields where 
the Cereal Grasses, forage, potatoes and clover are cultivated, and the 
roadsides, hedgerows, and waste ground in the neighbourhood of towns, 
villages, farm-houses, gardens and parks furnish a large number of these 
imported plants, but also the woods, the hedgerows and the pastures are 
often plainly, and still oftener presumably, of artificial origin, even when 
yielding trees, shrubs, grasses and other plants, which elsewhere in the 
district evidently occupy their natural places of growth. 

Excluding those which are probably or certainly extinct, and probably 
or certainly mis-reported, our list contains tho names of upwards of 1150 
species of Flowering Plants and Ferns, all of which have some sort of claim 
to be enumerated in a catalogue of the wild plants of North Yorkshire. Of 
these, 872 species appear to possess a more or less clear title to be regarded 
as aboriginal and genuine inhabitants of the Biding, and so far as we can 
judge from present appearances, it is these and these only that we must 
regard as composing its proper and natural flora. Out of the plants which 
grow wild with us at tbe present day, we must, if we wish to restrict our

list to those to which Nature gives us a title, strike out one species in four 
as introduced. But a large number of these introductions are now very 
thoroughly settled down. It is easy to arrange nearly all of them under 
two categories, the species of which, in respect of the plenty and the places 
in which they grow, differ notably. These two categories are, first, impor- 
tations by means of Agriculture ; and, second, importations by means of 
Horticulture ; and the only introduced species which do not range conve- 
niently under either of these heads are about a score of ballast plants and 
two or three trees. Following the nomenclature of the Cybele, I have 
called tho more frequent and more thoroughly established agricultural 
weeds by the name of Colonists, drawing the line between them and the 
Natives so as to exclude from the Native list those species which scarcely 
occur except in cultivated fields and about rubbish heaps, but so as to 
include as Natives a number of species such as Viola tricolor, Senecio 
vulgaris, Pyre thrum inodorum, and the Nettles, which though most fre- 
quent in cultivated ground, are also to be met with in quarries and along 
the sea-shore, about roadsides and on waste ground, and which, by a little 
more stringent interpretation of the probabilities which point towards 
introduction, would be added to the Colonist list. All except four of our 
Colonists are plants of but annual duration. Many of them are of very 
frequent occurrence, and it is probable that a large proportion of them are 
plants which have had their original home in those lands where the Cereal 
Grasses were first cultivated, and that their seeds have been carried about 
with cornseed from country to country. The Denizens, with the exception 
of one or two trees, and possible introductions along with ballast, are the 
well-established certain or probable introductions of Horticulture, and 
are mostly cither ornamental plants, the common trees or shrubs with 
eatable fruit which are grown in gardens, or plants of real or supposed 
medical utility. Populus alba, Sinapis muralis, Daphne Mezereum, Prunus 
avium and Chelidonium majus are typical representatives of these five 
classes of character. It is to the Denizens, as the term is here employed, 
that M. Alphonse De Candolle* would restrict the use of the term "natu- 
ralized," denying it to the Colonists, but with us in Britain tho word has 
been used with great looseness of application. The Aliens are plants which 
either make or havo mado their appearance in cultivated fields, casual 
stragglers from garden cultivation, imported trees not sufficiently estab-

liBhed to take a place amongst the Denizens, or else species which havo 
been introduced with ballast either from other parts of Britain, or from tho 
European Continent. Of the Agricultural Aliens, Melilotus vulgaris and 
Bromus arvensis are examples: of the Horticultural Aliens, Eranthia 
hyemalis and Cheiranthus Cheiri : of the trees, Carpinus Betulus and Cas- 
tanea vesca : of the ballast plants, Mercurialis annua and Galactites tomen- 
tosa. So that, in respect of citizenship, we have five categories to separate 
the species amongst, viz. : â€” 

1 . The Natives, so far as we can now judge, the aboriginal possessors of 
the soil. 

2 and 3. The Colonists and Denizens, tho well-established importations 
of the Historic period. 

4. The Aliens, importations not fullv established. 
5. The Incognita, species to be rejected from the list, either as being 
extinct, or as requiring confirmation before they can be claimed with safety. 

m Stational range of sped*. In treating of the distribution of species 
we have in the first place to consider tho familiar facts as to what is called 
station or habitat. Amongst plants we all know that one affects woods 
and shaded places, another dry banks and wall tops, a third pastures and 
grassy commons, a fourth bogs and ditches, a fifth heaths, a sixth marshes 
by the sea-side and the vicinity of salt springs inland, a seventh cultivated 
fields and waste around : some species beine restricted, with but trifling 
exception, to one of these kinds of locality, others growing as if indifferently 
in two or three of the kinds, whilst others are to be met with habitually 
in several or almost all of them. Each species plainly has its own special 
power of adaptation to varied physical conditions, and that power is very 
different in different natural orders, different genera, and even often in 
different species of the same genus. It is the power of adaptation possessed 
by the plant whioh the geographical botanist has to deal with when he 
comes to consider it, just as the physiologist has to deal with its structure 
and tho functions of its various organs, and the describer of species and 
systematist has to deal with its diagnostic characters. So much light or 
shade, such a kind of soil, so much heat, so much moisture, such a degree 
of consistency of soil ; in regard to all these points each species has its own 
special constitution, and this must be provided for in every one of its sta- 
tions in order to enable it to stand its ground in them and prosper. To 
designate the different kinds of locality we may employ a series of adjec- 
tives such as sylvestral, pratal, pascual, ericetal, uliginal, agrestal, and 
say that Drosera rotundifolia is a uliginal, Capsella bursa-pastoris an agree -

tal, and Hieracium tridentatum a sylvestral plant. These terms answer 
the purpose of conveying, in connection with a species, the idea of a 
certain definite association of physical conditions : hut we must hear in 
mind when we employ them and read them that they do not, and from 
the nature of the case cannot, cover and give expression to much in 
regard to conditions of station which has an important hearing upon distri- 
bution, and that, for the most part, they deal only with such of what may 
be called the factors of station as arc to be met with in most districts of 
an ordinary character. What I mean by this is, that in most tracts of 
country of any considerable extent there are to be found woods, hedges, 
meadows, pastures, bogs, heaths, and cultivated fields, tho woods produ- 
cing characteristically sylvestral species, the hedgerows characteristically 
septal species, tho meadows and pastures characteristically pratal and 
pascual plants, and so on through the series. In a limited tract of country 
the most prominent facts of species-distribution, so far as we can trace any 
connection with physical agencies at all, are plainly to be associated with 
differences between the condition of different parts of its surface such as 
are expressed by these adjectives. But when we come to speak of the 
physical conditions and agencies which interfere to modify or regulate the 
distribution of species over a more extensive area, these adjectives answer 
our purpose no longer, and wo are compelled to leave them behind. 

The influence of temperature upon the distribution of epectes. And then 
comes the question what are the factors that we can deal with which the 
terms we have alluded to do not cover which have a bearing npon the 
distribution of species on a grand scale. Of these, Temperature is plainly 
the most important, and the difference in the way in which in different 
cases its influence is exercised opens out a wide field for research and con- 
sideration. A plant is not a mere machine, like a thermometer, but a 
living organism, and in considering the question we must take care to 
remember that such is the case. Conditions of life and biological pheno- 
mena we have need to bear constantly in mind, and here as elsewhere, the 
mysterious principle of vitality constantly interferes to limit the appli- 
cation of our generalisations. Especially have we to remember the 
differences in respect of duration which plants present. An Annual plant 
normally grows up to perfection, and produces flower and seed during the 
same year in which the seed that produces it was sown. A Biennial plant 
produces only stems and leaves the first year, flowers and fruit the second, 
and like the Annual, after one flowering and fruiting dies away. A Peren- 
nial plant lasts for an indefinite number of years, yielding flowers and fruit

from the same root an indefinite number of times. So that in any locality 
the plants of these different categories in respect of duration are exposed 
in a very different manner to the range of variation which its temperature 
presents. Trees and shrubs, especially evergreens, are exposed more or 
less to the temperature of all the seasons of the year : herbaceous perennials 
and biennials, as a general rule, less so to the colds of Winter, especially 
in those countries where, as in ours, the cold almost suspends vegetation 
for a period, and where the ground is often overspread for a length of time 
with a covering of snow : whilst annuals mostly grow up to perfection and 
perish during, in our climate, a few months of the warmer part of the year. 

Different species attain perfection at different seasons of the year, some 
earlier and some later, some in Spring, some in Summer, others in Autumn, 
some having a wide range of flowering and fruiting time, others opening 
out their flowers in any locality, at a particular time, year after year, with 
great regularity. No phanerogamous plant can develope itself below the 
freezing point, and in different plants the sap begins to circulate at very 
different degrees of the thermometer. The seeds of Capsella bursa-pastoris 
begin to germinate at 33 or 34 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, but 
the seeds of Wheat require a temperature of 38, and the seeds of Flax of 
40 degrees before they will begin to swell. Willows and Poplars will 
sprout at a low temperature, whilst Vines, Liriodendrons, and Magnolias 
need a much higher one before their buds will begin to unfold. Each 
plant has, as it were, its own especial zero, all degrees of temperature 
below which exercise, at any rate, no favourable influence upon its growth. 
So that not only does the development of species take place at different 
times and seasons, but we see also that the temperatures of even the same 
season of development, for each species require to be specially divided 
between three separate divisions, those which are too low to do it any good, 
those which are more or less useful to it, and those which are too high to 
do it any good. And from this it results that a comparison between two 
different localities, not only of the mean temperature of the year, but even 
of the mean temperature of any particular month or season, will often 
furnish results which will hold good only with much exception so far as 
the plants which they produce, and as some species more than others, are 
concerned. 

So numerous and complicated are the influences which interfere to 
prevent the attainment of precision, that it seems to me by far the safest 
course not to attempt to speak of particular sums of temperature which 
species need in order to develope themselves, and that if we try to do so it

is more likely to mislead and to confuse than to help us. If we wish to 
express in the form of a generalisation the bearing in our climate of tem- 
perature upon species distribution, we must apparently say, that species 
are usually limited by cold, operating either positively, that is by the 
extreme colds or sudden falls of temperature in winter or the latter part of 
the autumn, or by the frosts of 6pring killing their young shoots and flower 
buds, this principally applying to trees and shrubs, and especially to ever- 
greens ; or by cold operating negatively, if we may so speak, that is to say, 
by the want of a certain amount of heat spread over a certain period of 
time, the heat being intense enough, and the period of time during which 
it is continued long enough, to enable them to produce their flowers and 
ripen their seeds, in the case of perennial species, if not every year, at 
least occasionally. This negative restriction must be the main one, and 
will apply to annuals, biennials and perennials alike, although the different 
periods of the year at which different species develope themselves must 
make a considerable difference in its application. Limitation by ex- 
cess of heat often shews itself as limitation by the lessening of hu- 
midity, but with us, in restricting the distribution of plants, it evidently 
operates only in a comparatively unimportant manner. 

The sums of summer heat and the extreme minima of the colder parts of 
the year arc then the data of temperature with which botanical geography 
is specially concerned. The following propositions embody the principal 
details with regard to the distribution of our local temperatures which it 
seems needful to recall to mind in this connection. We must remember 
that in observations upon temperature it is the monthly means of the air in 
the shade that are stated, and no doubt these upon the whole are the data 
which are most valuable to have. But they are deduced from the average 
of a number of years, and sometimes the temperature of a month rises 
above and sometimes falls below the average. They take equal cognizance 
of all degrees of temperature alike, both those which affect plants and 
those which do not. The temperature which a plant receives is partly 
that of the air, and partly that of the ground, which is somewhat different 
to, and much more uniform than that of the air. There is a wide differ- 
ence, especially at the warmest part of the year, between the temperature 
in the shade and in places which are exposed to the sun, as the tables which 
are given at page 46 shew in detail : and what has been stated respecting 
the temperature of springs may also suitably be referred to in connection 
with plants. These propositions embody those details with regard to the 
distribution of local temperature which seem to have any prominent bearing

upon the question we are now considering. In giving them it is hardly 
necessary to say that they are a mere essay, of course as true and thorough 
as I can make it at this present time, but still, that with regard to various 
points which come within their range, our information and observations 
are very limited and incomplete. 

1. In the shade, as compared with the temperature of the air at four 
feet from the ground, mean temperature is lower upwards, and several 
degrees lower upon the grass. The daily maxima in the sun are higher 
than the daily maxima in the shade, on an average of from 5 to 6 degrees 
in Winter to from 20 to 30 degrees in Summer. 

2. At a depth of one foot in the ground the mean temperature is on 
the average fully one degree above the mean temperature of the air in tho 
shade, the ground being proportionately or absolutely lower than the air 
in Spring and Summer, higher in Autumn and "Winter : and the difference 
between the extreme months of the year being less in the ground than in 
tho air by 5 degrees. 

8. As wo ascend from tho low country amongst the hills, the mean 
temperature of tho air sinks at an average rate of about one degree Fahren- 
heit per hundred yards, the lowering being apparently more in maxima 
than in minima, above tho average in Spring and Summer, below it in 
Autumn and Winter, and the ground temperatures, especially the minima, 
falling less rapidly than tho aerial means. 

4. The distribution of absolute winter minima follows a totally different 
plan from that of the sums of summer heat : whereas these latter fall gra- 
dually as we ascend the hills, winter minima, on the contrary, are often 
conspicuously less extreme at an elevation than in tho open low country, 
and instead of the temperature growing gradually lower as we ascend, 
within certain not very narrow limits it rises. 

5. As compared with the inland low country, at the sea-side the annual 
means are slightly higher, and the absolute winter minima conspicuously 
higher : but tho sums of summer temperature are appreciably lower in 
proportion to the an n u a l means. 

Tho following table gives the number of species of the Flowering Plants 
and Ferns which have been noted at the various elevations from the low 
country upwards.

It has been explained in the chapter on Climate that 66 of these species 
are essentially characteristic of a climate more boreal than that of our low 
country: but that the Montane species reached at any altitude as we 
ascend never compensate in number for the Ascending species which cease. 
In considering this table of the altitudinal range of species in connection 
with climate we must also take care to bear in mind what has been said 
respecting the stational range of plants, and to remember that, as we gra- 
dually ascend, not only are the sums of summer heat lowered, but that tho 
range of station for plants also becomes gradually restricted. For instance, 
to recur to the adjectives employed to denote the different kinds of station, 
we may say, speaking in general terms, that when within our limits an 
altitude of 400 yards is reached, such stations as are denominated by the 
terms paludal, viatical, agrcstal, sylvcstral and septal exist no longer, and 
that cricetal and uliginal greatly preponderate. We see that many plants 
stop short of our higher altitudes, and yet ascend elsewhere to much more 
boreal stations than we anywhere have them. For instance, with us there 
are no trees, either wild or planted, above 600 yards : but in the Scotch 
Highlands the Juniper ascends to 900 yards, the Rowan almost as high, 
the Scotch Fir, Birch, Raspberry, Hazel, Gale, Aspen, Rosa villosa, and

spinosissima, and several "Willows, to 500 yards and upwards, 500 yards 
under the more northern latitude being more than equivalent to 600 yards 
in Yorkshire. But in spite of this it cannot be doubted that the lowering 
of the number of species as we ascend has a close connection with the 
lowering of the sums of temperature. 

The influence of humidity upon the distribution of species. The distri- 
bution of aerial humidity and of the rainfall over the surface of our field of 
study does not appear to exercise any considerable direct influence upon 
the topography of its flora. The paludal and lacustral plants which we 
have are naturally nearly all of them restricted to the valHes and the lower 
levels of the slopes. No doubt the greater humidity of the moorlands has 
something to do with the restriction to their vicinity of the characteristically 
Montane species, both the Flowering Plants and Ferns, and the Mosses : 
and tends also to bring about a greater frequency and luxuriance of many 
other damp and shade-loving plants. The average number of characteris- 
tically Hygrophilous plants in the floras of the drainage districts is 39 for 
those of the West against 45 for those of the Bast Of five inland species 
of the Atlantic type of distribution, three are confined to the eastern, two 
to the western districts. Taking the flora of the eastern and western sub- 
provinces as a whole, tho most conspicuous and essential difference between 
them is expressed when we say that the West has a number of plants of 
the higher hills which the East has not, and the East has a number of 
plants of the sea-shore which the "West has not. The other species not 
common to both are not more specially damp-loving in one case than the 
other. 

The influence upon the topography of our flora in respect of humidity 
exercised by the distribution of the subjacent rocks is considerable, but it 
is not needful to recapitulate or summarise here what has already been 
advanced upon this head. For what I have to say upon tho matter the 
reader is referred to the chapter on Lithology. 

Explanation of the manner of stating the distribution of species. We 
may claim as plants of North Yorkshire very nearly three out of every 
four of the species which inhabit tho whole of Britain. This proportion 
applies both as regards the Flowering Plants and Ferns, and also to the 
Mosses. In our list of species the London Catalogue has been followed as 
a standard of nomenclature and arrangement, and what arc there given as 
species are here given as species, with very trifling alteration. Occa- 
sionally, as in the case of Callitricho verna and platycarpa, I do not possess 
the materials for tracing out properly the distribution of two closely allied

plants lib distinct from one another, and have united them for this reason. 
For convenience of reference a separate chapter has been devoted to each 
of the six principal subdivisions of Flowering Plants, but I have not 
thought it necessary to tako up space by giving the names of the Natural 
Orders. Tho figures which precede the names of the species are intended 
to indicate their distribution in Britain as a whole. They refer to the 
types of distribution, as defined in the Cybele Britannica,* as follows ; 

1. British type. Species which are more or less generally diffused 
throughout the whole or nearly the whole of Britain. 

2. English type. Species which havo their head-quarters in England, 
especially in the southern provinces, and become rare and finally cease 
altogether towards the north. 

8. Scottish type. Species which, in a manner contrary to those which 
make up the last type, have their head-quarters in Scotland or the North 
of England, and become rare, and finally cease altogether southward. 

4. Highland type. The boreal flora in a more intense degree. Species 
which have their head-quarters amongst tho Scotch Highlands, and are 
only found southward in tho vicinity of elevated mountains. 

5. Germanic type. Species which havo their head-quarters in the 
south-east of England, and run out northward and westward. 

6. Atlantic type. Species which have their head-quarters in tho south- 
west of England, and run out northward and eastward. 

7. Intermediate type. Species which have their head-quarters in tho 
south of Scotland and the north of England, and run out both northward 
and southward. 

8. Local type. Species too much restricted in their range to take rank 
under any of the types which have been defined. 

Immediately after the name of the species and tho authority for the 
name, follows the category of citizenship to which, so far as North York- 
shire is concerned, tho species seems to me properly to belong, Native, 
Colonist, Denizen, Alien or Incognit, as the case may be. The Alien 
plants of the Middlesbro' ballast hills are given by themselves in a list at 
the end of the enumeration of the Flowering plants. 

If, as regards its distribution within our limits, the species belongs to 
any of tho three geographical categories tho plants of which stand out, 

â€¢ The clarification of species under their typo of distribution as given by Mr. Watson in the 
fourth Tolumc of the Cybele (pp. 175 â€” 231) has been followed implicitly; I hare given here only the 
primary type to which each species is referred, but in the list in the Cybele the normal representatives

geographically speaking, in most prominent relief from the general mass 
of the vegetation, the word Montane, Xerophilous, Subxerophilous, Mari- 
time or Submaritime next follows. 

The next item in most of the paragraphs is intended to show the hori- 
zontal distribution of the species, so far as this can be done by means of 
the drainage districts which have been do lined. If the "Area" is given 
as "general" the species is either reported to me upon good authority or 
has been seen by myself in all the nine drainage districts. Upwards of 
one in three of the Native, Colonist and Denizen species, are thus circum- 
stanced. If a row of figures follow the word "Area" the species is only 
known clearly in the districts which the figures indicate. It is only the 
distribution of Native, Colonist and Denizen species which is indicated as 
has just been explained, not that of Aliens, and figures are only given 
where the evidence in favour of tho occurrence of a species seems to me of 
sufficient value to be worthy of acceptance. The drainage districts are 
indicated by figures as follows, as in the map, and the second part of this 
volume.

Next follows such an account as I am prepared to give of the Vertical 
Range of the plant within our limits. C. L. stands for coast-level, and 
the species thus marked, except the Submaritime species, are those which 
occur with us only amongst the sandhills and cliffs of the coast-line. 
When a couple of numbers are given after the word "Range" the first 
indicates the lower limit, the second the upper limit of the species. All 
species which descend below 100 yards, except a few marked 50, and those 
which are confined to the coast-line, have their lower limit stated as 0,

and above 100 yards the limits are pi von in leaps of 50 yards. The upper 
limits above 100 yards are also given in leaps of 50 yards. Where one 
number only is given the ascertained vertical range of the species is under 
50 yards, and that number indicates the 50 yard point to which its station 
or stations are nearest. By Professor Philips, the late Mr. Gray, and 
others, the heights of many of our prominent hills and of various points in 
the dales were many years ago ascertained, and now, in the recently pub- 
lished maps of the Ordnanco Survey, we are furnished with all that can 
possibly be desired in this respect. In stating both upper and lower 
limits I have gone upon the principle of keeping within the mark. A 
species which occurs from the v allies upward to a height of 1900 feet has 
its Range given as 0-600. A considerable number of species which grow 
upon the Main Limestone of Micklefell at about 2500 feet are given at 
0-800. In those cases whero I have not myself seen the localities for a 
plant I have, of course, had to estimate its altitudes as well as I could, 
but there are very few of the higher stations that are mentioned which I 
have not personally examined. 

In the concluding portion of the paragraph devoted to each species is 
described in the first place the character of the stations in which it grows, 
woods, grassy places, cultivated fields, &c, as the case may be ; and after 
this is given a summary verbal outline of its distribution. The word 
M Yallies" is only used in the restricted sense to which allusion has been 
made : it covers no more than the New Bed Sandstone and Kimmeridge 
Clay tracts of the geological map. What is said respecting the frequency 
of a species will of course be understood to be limited by what is said with 
regard to its range : a species may be thinly scattered over a wide range 
or abundant within a limited range, though the converse holds true usually. 
For many of the less frequent, or more geographically interesting species, 
the names of the places in the neighbourhood of which they grow are 
given : but it is only for the rarities that I have thought it needful to 
indicate special stations with any degree of minuteness. In enumerating 
places I have almost always begun with the north-west and proceeded 
towards the south-east. "On the west," if used without any qualification, 
means on the west of the Central Valley : "on the east" refers in the same 
manner. Of the books which have been consulted and the friends who 
have been laid under contributions for details, a table is given at the end 
of my list of species : but it is only for the stations of the rarer or more 
critical plants, where these have not been seen by myself, that authorities 
are quoted. A note of exclamation implies that I have seen an authentic

specimen of the plant spoken of. For plants which have been described 
as species, but which do not rank as such in the London Catalogue, I have 
endeavoured to make the list as complete as possible. In the identification of 
segregate species I have been materially aided by the kindness of Professor 
Boreau of Angers, who has not only supplied me with specimens of many 
of those which are described in his "Flore du Centre de la France," but 
has also examined and given me his opinion upon a series of the critical 
plants of North Yorkshire. To the liberality of Dr. Fauconnct of Geneva 
I am also indebted for authentic specimens of many of the species of M.M. 
Jordan and Router. But, except in the case of a few Aliens, unless a plant 
is treated in a separate paragraph, and unless an Alien, if it has not a 
separate statement of "Range" and "Area" it is never included as distinct 
in any n or summary.

CUmatis Vitalba L. Alien? In Cleveland in hedges near Whitby, 
MiddUton ! and below the Warren near Gnisbro', Mudd ! I have not seen 
the localities, but hesitate to accept the species as otherwise than an Alien. 
It is not clearly known as indigenous in Britain north of South Wales and 
the Severn province, and is not a plant of Denmark or Scandinavia. It 
is a species which is frequently planted as an ornamental shrub, and grows 
subspontaneously in one or two places where it has plainly been introduced, 
as in Buncombe Park, and the woods at the Green near Richmond.

in the neighbourhood of houses or gardens. It ascends in Wensleydale to 
Aysgarth and Redmire, and is grown in a garden on Marrick moor at 300 
yards. It is sometimes used as a medicine for cows, which perhaps may 
account for its being met with so often about farmhouses and villages.

amongst the western hills it is not nnfreqnent. It ascends to the peak of 
Great Whernside and the Main Limestone of Micklefell, and like Myrrhis, 
descends with the streams into the Central Valley. So that it has, in 
fact, a widely diffused "Montane" superadded to a "Maritime" role of

whence it is recorded in the original Botanist's Guide by Archdeacon 
Peirson, and where it is not unlikely to be indigenous. It occurs in 
more suspicious stations near Whitby and Scarbro', and is an occasional 
weed of cultivated fields inland. It is grown up to 500 yards, but will

casually above 400 yards. Upon the heavy soils of the Lias and Gritstone 
the Turnip and Oat are more profitable and successful than anything else. 
Like the preceding, it is frequent in a subspontaneous state in cultivated 
fields and along streams, and for its original home we must probably look 
in the same direction.

3 Stcllaria nemorum L. Native. Montane. Area 9 8 7 6 3 2. Range 
50-400. Streamside8 and damp woods in tho dales, one of the most fre- 
quent of the characteristically Montane species. In Teesdale it does not 
ascend above "Winch bridge, but it occurs not only in the main dale, but 
also in Balderdale and Gretadale, and lower down tho Tees as far as Pierso 
bridge, Croft and Dal ton. In Swaledale it grows in Applegarth woods, 
and in the Yore district it ascends to the woods of Fossdale and Whitfell 
gill, and descends tho river to Tanfield. By the Wharfe side it grows 
near Thorp Arch : in the Central Valley at Kirklington : and on the east 
in Whitstoncliff and Coxwold woods, in tho dale of the Rye and in several 
stations in the Howardian tract. Its distribution is nearer to that of 
Troll ius than any other species, and in their diffusion the two are only 
below Myrrhis and Crop is paludosa of the Montane species. 

1 S. media L. Native. Area general. Range 0-650. Shaded and

highest place in which I have seen it is near a shepherd's hut on the ridge 
that runs from the peak of Nine Standards towards the source of the 
* Swale : the next highest near a shooting box on the Main Limestone of 
Askrigg moor. 8. neglecta Weihe is frequent in shaded places. S. Bora-

300. Not unfrequent in dry sandy ground throughout the Lower zone. On 
the west it ascends to the flagstone quarries of Leyburn Moor and the Main 
Limestone of Leyburn Shawl. In the Central Vale it grows at Brompton- 
on-Swalc, TopclifFe and about the Stockton and Strensall heaths : and in the 
llowardian tract at Yearsley and Terrington. In Cleveland it is a plant 
of the basaltic dike and coast sandhills.

1 C. arveme L. Native. Subxerophilous. Area 9876532 1. 
Range 0-250. Dry banks, one of the most frequent of the characteristi- 
cally xcrophilous species. Resides its stations amongst the lower levels 
of the calcareous tracts it is plentiful amongst the coast sandhills, and 
occurs in many of the drier parts of the Central Vale, especially by the 
strcamsides, us for instance by the Tees between Croft and Dalton, the â€¢ 
Swale at Sandhutton and TopclifFe, and the Ouse along Clifton ings. It 
is allied in its distribution to Anthyllis Vulneraria, but does not ascend so 
high. 

Linum usitatissimum L. Alien. Occasionally cultivated in the Lower 
zone, and to be met with casually in a subspontaneous state. Linton-on- 
Ouse, the Lintune of the Domesday book, is said to derive its name from 
the plant, so that it would seem that its growth is of ancient date. 

5 L. perenne L. Native. Xcrophilous. Area 7. Range 250. In the 
Yore district in the western edge of Leyburn Shawl, Ward! Reported 
also by Teesdale from fields at Rulmer.

and grown in gardens up to 300 yards in the dales. 

2 M. rotund i/olia L. Native. Area general. Range 0-200. Frequent 
in similar situations to the preceding, ascending Wensleydalo to Redmirc. 

2 Tilia parvifolia Ekrh. Native. Area 3. Range 100-200. I have 
seen this species only in one place in an indigenous state, and that is at 
Slip gill near Rievaulx, where aboriginal woods, composed principally of 
Oak and Hazel, cover the steeply-sloping rocky banks of one of the lone- 
liest and pleasantest glens of the eastern calcareous range. As a planted 
tree it occurs within our limits occasionally, and T. intermedia as a planted 
â€¢ tree is frequent. I have seen both of them up to 350 yards. 

2 T. grandifolia Â£hrh. Native. Area 8. Range 100-250. Mr. Ward 
considers this species to be truly indigenous amongst the limestone scars of 
the lower part of Swalcdalc. He writes â€” "The wood (where it occurs) 
near the Round Howe is a rocky wood and without any planted trees. At 
Clink Bank also it grows from the clefts of the rock in a very precipitous 
place, where no trees can well have been planted. In both places I should 
say that it is perfectly indigenous. Near the Round Howe it is plentiful. 
At Clink Bank there are three or four trees, with innumerable young 
shoots growing from the bottom out of tho rocks, and Galium borealc 
grows upon the rock within twenty yards of it." As a planted tree the 
species is not unfrcqucnt. It is recorded by Mr. R. B. Bowman from 
West Burton in Bishopdale, but the details respecting this station are not 
stated. There is a noble avenue of Limes in Thirkleby Park near Thirsk, 
which includes all the three species. 

2 Hypericum Androaamum L. Native. Area 8 4 3. Range 0-100. 
Woods and hedgebanks in tho low countrv, rare. In the Central Vullev 
it grows in the neighbourhood of Sinderby, and in the lane between 
Mawnby and Kirby Wiske. Near the Cleveland coast it grows at Kilton 
and in the woods of Larpool and Hawsker, and it has also been gathered 
by Mr. Reynolds near Hackncss.

in the low country and amongst the hills. In both our eastern and wes- 
tern dales no tree is more frequent about villages and farmhouses. I have 
never seen it in any quantity in a clearly aboriginal wood, like the Ash, 
Oak, Birch, Hazel, Holly, Wych Elm, &c, or even like Tilia parvifolia 
in Slip gill, but have often noticed a single tree or two or three trees in 
very wild-looking places, as for instance, East Stonesdale woods, and in 
Cliff gill, where there were no houses within a considerable distance, and 
no other seemingly introduced trees or other plants near. Upon the whole 
I would say, that with us the Sycamore, like the Gooseberry bush and 
Cherry tree, is not unlikely to bo indigenous, but that I have not seen or 
heard of any evidence which shows conclusively that such is the case.

losophical Transactions for 1701,â€” "Many of the trees have been burnt, sometimes quite through : 
others chopped, squared, bored through or split, * * and this at depths and under circumstances 
which preclude all supposition of their having been touched since the destruction of the forest." The

This species in Upper Teesdale is one of the most prominent plants of the 
riverside. It begins at Upper Cronkley, is plentiful about the High force 
and Winch bridge, and continues down the river as far as the Middleton 
bridge. It is given by Ray as a plant of the Tees side near Eglestone 
Abbey, but I have not seen it there, and probably it was only casually 
washed down. Its abundance in Teesdale, considered in connection with 
its rarity in the rest of Britain, is one of the most salient facts of plant- 
topography which it falls within the scope of these notes to register.

Range 300-500. Indigenous in Tecsdalc upon Holwick scare and in 
Swaledale upon the Red Scare near Downholme. It grows in the bed of 
the Tees at Winch bridge, but I believe only upon the Durham Bide of the 
river, and in plantations is not uncommon. 

1 ryrus Aueuparia Gaertn. Native. Area general. Range 0-600. 
Not common in the low country, or in hedgerows and plantations, but one 
of the most frequent indigenous trees amongst the arenaceous hills, where 
it is often associated with the Birch. The highest stations in which I 
have seen it are upon the banks of a stream upon the plateau of Holwick 
fell, and on the spur of Cronklcy fell west of the White force. No other 
tree ascends higher with us than this, and only the Juniper as high. For 
North Yorkshire we may say that the presence of trees, either aboriginal 
or planted, marks the Agrarian Region ; tho presence of fruticose Rubi, 
Viburnum Opulus, Cornus sanguines and Acer campestre the Lower zone.

7 Ribes Gro88ularia L. Denizen. Area general. Range 0-300. 
Commonly cultivated up to 350 yards, and commonly subspontaneous in 
woods and hedgerows throughout the Lower zone.' The station most 
likely to be natural in which I have seen it is in Flazcndnle, where from 
a dozen to a score bushes form a thicket at the bottom of a calcareous 
glen, side by side with a similar thicket of Blackthorn. Upon the turf 
beneath them Ophrys muscifera grows, and some of the adjacent woods 
are clearly of aboriginal growth : but as there does not seem to be any of 
the Ribes elsewhere amongst them it is not unlikely it may have been 
planted, although there are no houses in the glen and no trace of an enclo- 
sure. I have noticed it in other stations by scores, but almost always 
single bushes, or two or three together, either by the streamsides or in 
hedgerows.

of dispersion, and one of the commonest Montane species we have. It is 
common in fields and by the side of the streams in the dales of both the 
western and eastern hills. It ascends in Teesdale to Upper Cronklcy and 
in the Yore district to the point of junction of the two branches of the 
Cotterdale stream. It is carried down by the Tecs, Swale and Yore into 
the Central Valley, and by the Derwent into the Yale of Pickering, but I 
know of it in one place only in the Central Valley apart from the streams 
which rise amongst the hills, and that is in a field at Sowerby near Thirsk. 
By tho Esk at Whitby it grows side by side with some of the characteris- 
tically Maritime species. I have seen it at Coxwold and Boltby, and it 
occurs in the Howardian tract in several places. With us its nearest 
geographical allies are Crepis paludosa, Trollius europaBus and Stellaria 
nemorum.

2 Atropa Belladonna L. Native. Subxerophilous. Area 9 8 7 4 3 2. 
Range 0-250. In the western dales at Cotherstone and West Burton. 
About the Magnesian Limestone at Pierce bridge, Snape and Gebdykes 
near Masham. In the dales of the tabular calcareous range of the east it 
is a plant of the aboriginal woods in several places. In Yowlasdale it is 
abundant, and it occurs also in Dunoombe woods, on the slope of Fadmoor 
near Kirby-moorside, and near Scarbro' at Barrowcliff. Elsewhere in the 
east near a limekiln at Upsal, in Cleveland in Mareke mill wood, and in 
the Howardian tract at Airyholme. I have no hesitation in considering 
it a Native in at any rate the dale stations.

vation. V. nigrum was found by Mr. Ward near Middleton Tyas, in the 
lane which leads to Croft; V. Lychnitit by Mr. Ward on rubbish by the 
Swale side at Brompton ; V. virgatum I have seen in a timber-yard at

the stations mentioned. The higher localities of Arenaria serpyllifolia 
and some other species may not unlikely have originated in a similar 
manner. Amongst the higher hills the sheep often resort to the limestone 
banks for the sake of the grassy herbage which covers them.

Bowan, Birch, Hawthorn, and some of the Boses and Willows, and in the 
upper part of the western dales it is scarcely to be seen. It was the only 
indigenous deciduous-leaved forest tree that suffered notably from the 
severe weather of the Christmas of 1860. I think that I have seen it at 
500 yards in Teesdale, but if so I have neglected to make a note at the 
time. With us Q. pedunculate is much more frequent both in the dales 
and low country than Q. sessili/lora, but this latter is pretty generally

2 Fagus syhatica L. Denizen. Area general. Bange 0-400. The 

swamps, upon which 

ground I have placed it as " Denizen." At the present day it is planted 
up to 400 yards amongst the hills, and, unlike the Oak, is not unfrequent 
in the upper part of the western dales. But although such is the case I 
have not, after careful search, been able to meet with it either amongst 
the calcareous scars of the western hills or in the aboriginal woods of the 
eastern dales. Judging from present appearances solely, I should say that 
the Beech is less likely to be indigenous with us than the Sycamore. 

C cutanea vulgaris. Lam. and Carp inns Betid us L. are both to be met 
with not unfrequently in hedgerows and plantations, but have no claim to 
be regarded as indigenous. I have seen the former in Arkendale clearly 
within the bounds of the Middle zone, but even in the low country the 
fruit only just grows so as to be eatable. 

1 Corylue Avellana L. Native. Area general. Bange 0-550. The 
commonest bush of the aboriginal dale woods, especially in the calcareous 
dales of both the eastern and western hills. Frequent in the low country, 
but not so common in the hedgerows as the Hawthorn. It ascends to the 
upper part of Cronkley scars and the Main Limestone cliffs of Funchard's 
gill. 

1 Alnus glutinoea L. Native. Area general. Bange 0-350. Common 
in damp woods and along the banks of streams, ascending in Teesdale to 
Hoi wick, in Swaledale to Shaw wood near Langthwaite, and in the Yore 
district to the lower part of Fossdale. 

1 Betula alba L. including glutinosa Frit*. Native. Area general. 
Bange 0-550. Common in woods and hedgerows throughout the Agrarian 
region, especially amongst the arenaceous hills, where the Bowan is its 
frequent associate. The glen of Maze beck and that of the northern fork 
of the Swale are both called Birkdale.

2 Populu* alba L. with P. canescens Smith. Denizen. Area general. 
Range 0-200. The two species are both not unfrequent in hedgerows 
and along streamsides in the low country. Winch regards P. alba as indi- 
genous in the Tyne province, but I have not seen either of them within 
our limits in a clearly indigenous situation. 

1 P. tremula L. Native. Area 9 8 6 5 4 3 21. Range 0-550. Fre- 
quent in woods and hedgerows, ascending to Cronkley and Holwick scars. 
Doubtless it is an inhabitant of the Yore district, but I have no note of its 
occurrence. 

2 P. nigra L. Denizen. Area general. Range 0-300. Frequent in 
hedgerows and by streamsides throughout the Lower zone, but quitÂ© 
doubtful as an indigenous tree. P. dilatata is not unfrequently planted in 
the low country. P. monilifera occurs in plantations up to 350 yards, 
and succeeds better than almost any other tree in exposed situations along 
our sea coast. 

3 Salix pentandra L. Native. Area general. Range 0-350. Frequent 
along streamsides and in hedgerows and damp woods throughout the Lower 
â– one, ascending to the lower part of Whitstondale. 

1 S. fragilit L+ including deeipiens Hoffm. and Eusselliana Smith. 
Native. Area general. Range 0-250. Common by streamsides and 
damp woods in the Lower zone, ascending to the fishpond upon Lartington 
moor. 

1 S. alba L. Native. Area general. Range 0-200. Common in 
similar situations to the preceding, with which it is often associated. Both 
are commonly planted throughout the Lower zone. S. cctruUa and 5. 
vitellina both occasionally occur. 

2 S. triandra L. Native. Area 9 8 7 6 5 3 2 1. Range 0-150. Fre- 
quent by streamsides in the low country, and often planted in osier grounds, 
8. undulata, which is indigenous in West Yorkshire, I have met with 
sparingly in an osier ground in the neighbourhood of Thirsk. 

8 S. acutifoli* WiUd. Denizen. Area 7 5. Range 0-200. Found by 
Mr. Ward in 1831 at Broadhams near Wensley, a single bush only, which 
is now eradicated. More recently it has been met with by Mr. Mudd in 
Airyholme wood, and in two or three places by the Leven side near Great 
Ayton, but only in very small quantity in each station.

Range 0-250. Common by the streamsides in the western dales, and 
occurring also more sparingly about the streams and damp woods in various 
parts of the low country. It ascends in Teesdale to Holwick, in Wens- 
leydale to Hawes, and is sometimes planted in osieries. 

2 Salix rubra JTuds. Native. Area 9 8 7 5 2. Range 0-100. Banks of 
Barton beck near Croft, of the Tees at Yarm, of the Swale at Richmond 
and in many places lower down, of the Yore at Tanfield, and of Codbeck 
at Thirsk ; also in Carlton carr, and sometimes planted in osieries. 

1 S. viminalis L. Native. Area general. Range 0-250. One of the 
commonest species of the streamsides of the low country, but less frequent 
in the western dales than S. purpurea and 8. phylicifolia. Commonly 
planted in osieries. Grown in gardens up to 350 yards. 

2 S. Smithiana WiUd. Native. Area general. Range 0-300. Com- 
mon throughout the Lower zone about streamsides and in hedgerows and 
damp woods, ascending to the lower part of Widdale. 8. ferruginea and 
8. rugosa are both frequent, but the genuine S. acuminata (8. dasyclados 
Wimmer) I have not seen from within our limits. Dr. Anderssen suggests 
that the plant from the neighbourhood of Richmond given in Leefe's 
Salictum as No. 39, is S. Seringeana Gaud. 

1 8. einerea L. Native. Area general. Range 0-450. Common by 
streamsides, and in hedgerows and damp woods, ascending to the falls of 
the Cover at the foot of Great Whernside, and the Main Limestone scars 
of Punchard's gill. No. 43 of the Salictum, of which there is a single 
tree near the bridge over the Swale at Applegarth, is not unlikely a hybrid 
between this and S. phylicifolia. Dr. Anderssen referred it to S. laurina. 

1 S. aurita L. Native. Area general. Range 0-550. Frequent in 
damp thickets, especially amongst the hills, ascending to Cronklcy scars. 

1 8. Caprea L. Native. Area general. Range 0-550. Common in 
woods and hedgerows, ascending in Teesdale to Cronkley and White force 
scars, in Arkendale to the Main Limestone cliffs of Punchard's gill. 

3 S. nigricans Fries. Native. Montane. Area 9 8 7 3 2. Range 
0-400. Not so frequent about the streamsides in the western dales as S. 
phylicifolia. In Gretadalo near Rutherford bridge. In Swaledale about 
Richmond in several places. In the Yore district in Fossdale woods, and 
at Gale force and in Hardraw gill. Amongst the eastern hills in Bilsdale, 
Flazendale, Beckdale and Cockerdale. The common form of North York- 
shire is S. Andersoniana Smith. S. hirta S. B. 37 is from a marshy field 
near Ravens worth. The plants given in the Salictum as rupestris Dr. 
Anderssen places under S. phylicifolia.

3 S. phylicifolia L. Native. Montane. Area 9 8 7. Range 50-550. 
Common upon the banks of the streams in the western dales. It ascends 
in Teesdale to the falls of Maze beck, in Swale dale to Raven's Scat, and 
in the Yore district to Hell gill and the falls of the Cover at the foot of 
Great Whernside. This includes plants referred by Messrs. Ward and 
Leefe to laurina, propinqua, tenuior, tenuifolia, Davalliana, Weigeliana, 
nitons, Crowcana, laxiflora and tetrapla. Though much more common 
than S. nigricans in the west this has not been found at all amongst the 
eastern hills. 

1 S. repent L. Native. Area general. Range 0-550. Common in 
heathery ground, ascending to Cronkley scars. S. rosmar in i folia has been 
reported from Seamer "Water and Saltersgate, probably in error for this 
species. S. herbacea is mentioned as a North Yorkshire plant by Teesdale, 
but is not known to me as such. 

1 Ifyrica OaU L. Native. Area 6 4 3. Range 0-200. Plentiful in 
Askham bogs and in the Yale of Pickering in swampy fir woods ono mile 
south-west of A y ton. It occurs also in several of the dales of the eastern 
arenaceous hills : in Eskdale south of Castleton, and plentiful in Goath- 
land dale, Ncwtondale (Fen bog), and Harwood dale. In the Scotch 
Highlands it ascends to an elevation of 560 yards, but it is not known to me 
as a plant of our western hills, and in the east its known stations are all 
clearly within the Lowor zone. 

3 Pinus sylvestris L Denizen. Area general. Range 0-450. This is 
a tree of the post-glacial peat swamps, and at the present day is frequent 
both in the low country and amongst the hills. Entire woods of it are not 
unfrequent, as between Grilling and Helmsley, and a clump or row of trees 
may often be seen upon the north and east of houses in exposed situations. 
Whether any of the trees now in existence are the descendants of the 
aboriginal possessors of the soil may be doubted, and it is quite impossible 
to decide confidently. Larix europesa is still more frequent than the 
Pinus, and forms extensive plantations in the dales and in exposed sterile 
tracts both in the low country and amongst the hills where no other tree 
succeeds. Abies exceha is frequent in plantations both in the low country 
and amongst the hills, and will prosper in damper situations than suit the 
two preceding, but is not so hardy : and Abies pectinata, though not 
nearly upon a par as regards frequency with the other three is occasionally 
to be seen. There is a considerable quantity of it in Deepdale woods. 
Taken together, these planted Conifers are doubtless as plentiful at the 
present day in North Yorkshire as a whole as all the other trees taken

together, and in many districts they give to the scenery its predominant 
tone. 

1 Juniperus communi* L. Native. Subxerophilous. Area 9 8 5 4 3. 
Range 0-600. This and the Rowan have the widest vertical range of all 
the trees, and though far from frequent, the Juniper seems te be usually 
of indigenous growth where it does occur. In Teesdale it ascends to the 
plateau of Cronkley fell, and is plentiful about the river at the High force 
and lower down. In the "West Swale district it grows upon the limestone 
scars in several places, and ascends to the Main Limestone of Gunnerside 
gill, Punc hard's gill and Booze moor. Elsewhere it grows only in small 
quantity. It is to be met with at Staniston hill near Burniston, about the 
head of the Leven and on the moors above Guisbro' and Battersby, and 
also in Snailesworth and Danbydale. Contrary to the Furze and Broom, 
tho Juniper and Yew are with us par excellence bushes of the Mountain 
Limestone tract, the former being more especially prominent in Teesdale, 
the latter in Swalcdale. 

2 Taxus baccata L. Native. Xerophilous. Area 9 8. Kan go 100- 
450. Clearly indigenous upon the scars of the western hills. In Swale- 
dale it ascends to the Main Limestone scars of West Stonesdale moor and 
Copperthwaite moor, and is plentiful in the woods of the lower part of the 
dale. It is also to be met with upon the cliffs in Teesdale, Gretadale 
and Deepdale, and may be indigenous in the east in Wass woods and 
Hovingham woods, and in some other places. It is one of the frequent 
trees of the post-glacial peat swamps, but is uncommon now, even as 
planted. 

Summary. In this chapter 99 species are enumerated, 15 of which are

hills, ascending in the Yore district to the upper part of Coverdale, in 
Swaledale to Raven's Seat In the Central Valley on Carthorpe moor, 
Stockton forest and in Crathorn woods. Of the two species H. chloranth* 
is with us the most frequent and has the widest vertical range. The 
genuine bifolia grows upon the Hambleton plateau near Hambleton house, 
at an elevation of 300 yards.

wood, Dowthwaite dale, Thornton dale, Yedmandale, &c. This species 
and the preceding, like Convallaria majalis, furnish typical illustrations of 
the Xerophilous role. 

Malax in paludosa Swartz. Incognit. This species was found by a miner 
of the name of John Binks, who lived at Middleton in Teesdale about fifty 
years ago, upon the spur of hill upon the Yorkshire side of the High 
Force, but I am not aware that it has been met with recently. 

7 Cypripedium Calceolu* L. Native. Area 3. Range 150. The best 
known station for this species is in Ouldray gill near Helmsley, where it 
has been gathered by several botanists. Mr. J. H. Phillips of Beadlam 
grange saw the plant there in flower in 1849. It has also been met with 
in the main dale of Rye between Hawnby and Rievaulx, and may not

unlikely occur in some of the dense aboriginal woods of other glens of the 
eastern calcareous range. 

2 Iris fcetidissima Z. Native. Area 8 7 5 3 2 1. Range 0-100. 
Rare in watery places in the low country. Kirklington, Little Nunwick, 
Raskelf, Nether Silton, Helmsley, and in Cleveland between Busby and 
Kirby, and on the banks of the mill-race at Easby. 

1 I. Pseudacorus L. Native. Area general. Range 0-150. Common 
in watery places in the low country, ascending to Gormire. 

Crocus vernus and C. aureus are both occasional stragglers from garden 
cultivation. 

2 Narcissus Pseudo-narcissus L. Native. Area 9 8 6 5 4 8. Range 
0-150. Often simply subspontaneous in fields and orchards (this usually 
the full-flowered state), but clearly indigenous in woods amongst the lower 
levels of the hill-country in several places. Probably a true Native about 
the Magnesian Limestone at Pierse bridge and Thorp Arch, and on the 
east in Langbargh woods, Goathland dale, Rosedale, in Eskdale near Egton 
bridge, Harwood dale, Yedmandale, Cloughton and Raincliffe. N.poeticus 

. is or has been subspontaneous in the castle yard at Pickering. N. bijhrus 
occurs in a field by the side of the road between Richmond and Aske, and 
at Thornborough, and near the Kilvington Roman Catholic chapel near 
Thirsk. i\T. incomparabilis grows with biflorus at Kilvington, and has also 
been gathered in a field near Guisbro' Spa. OaUmthus nivalis is frequently 
subspontaneous in parks and near gardens, but I have no hesitation in 
placing it with the three Narcissi in the Alien category, so far as North 
Yorkshire is concerned. 
Lilium Martagon L. Alien. Occasionally subspontaneous in the neigh- 
. bourhood of gardens. Hedgebank at St. Martin's near Richmond, Ward. 
Wood near the hall at Thorp Arch, Backhouse. Plantation by the Swale 
side below Aisenby. I have seen a specimen of Tulipa syhestris from the 
neighbourhood of Malton, but do not know upon which side of the Dcrwent 
it was gathered.

beck near Richmond. A. Schcmoprasum is reported by Mr. Flintoff in the 
Botanist's Guide from meadows at Kirby-moorside. 

1 A. urrinum L. Native. Area 9 8 7 5 4 3 2 1. Range 0-350. Com- 
mon in shaded places throughout the Lower zone, ascending in Teesdale to 
Unthank, in Swaledale to thickets below the Main Limestone scars of West 
8tone8dale moor. 

7 Gagea lutea Eer. Native. Area 9 8 7 5 3 2. Range 0-250. Not 
unfrequent in shaded places, especially in the lower part of the dales. 
In the west at Cotherstono, Brignal, Rokeby, Applegarth, Richmond and 
Wenslcy, and about the Magnesian Limestone at Pierse bridge, Thorp 
Arch, Marsficld and Brown Holme near Masham. In the Central Yalley 
at Brompton-on-Swale, Camphill, and in a wood on the south side of the 
Swale near Leckby carr. On the east in Newton wood and near Little 
Ayton, in the Vale of Mowbray at Leake and Mount St. John, and amongst 
the calcareous hills and in the Howardian tract in numerous stations. 

2 Ornithogalum umbellatum L. Denizen. Area 8 6 3 2. Range 0-100. 
In the neighbourhood of Thirsk this species grows in a meadow scattered 
over at least an acre of what seems to be unbroken grazing ground, and 
also in smaller quantity in another meadow in the same vicinity, in both 
cases associated only with truly indigenous plants. It has also been met 
with at Carthorpe, Middlethorp near York, on Tcrrington Broats and in 
Forge valley. 

1 Hyacinthu* non-scriptus L. Native. Area general. Range 0-350. 
Common in woods and upon the borders of heaths throughout the Lower 
zone, ascending in Swaledale to Kcld, in Arkcndale to Shaw wood. 

Rwcut aculeatus L. Alien. Subspontaneous in two or three places, 
but apparently without any claim to be considered an indigenous plant 

8 C&nvalhria bifolia L. Native. Area 3. Range 150-200. Upon 
the wooded escarpment of the eastern calcareous range on the slope of 
Hutton Bushel moor towards Everley, scattered over a space of ground 
ninety yards in length. Found in 1857 by Messrs. Reynolds and Braby. 
This is the only British station where the plant is clearly indigenous. It 
is widely distributed upon the Continent from Scandinavia southward, and 
is plentiful in the Northern United States.

Summary. Incognits and segregates excluded, 1 54 species come under 
this -chapter, 8 of which are Aliens, 5 Colonists, and 141 Natives. Of 
those which come under the two latter categories of citizenship, 142 arc 
plants of the Lower, 73 of the Middle, and 24 of the Upper zone ; and 
they range under the types of distribution as follows, viz. ; British 103, 
English 26, Scottish 5, Highland 5, Germanic 4, Intermediate 1, Local 2. 



The following is a list of the more noteworthy plants which from time 
to time have been noticed upon the ballast hills near the mouth of the Tees 
upon the Yorkshire side of the river. A considerable extent of surface 
which even within the last ten years was waste ground is now (1862) built 
over, and doubtless a large proportion of the species enumerated have en- 
tirely disappeared. The species not otherwise known as plants of North 
Yorkshire have their names printed in Italics : and all of these, except 
such as arc expressly otherwise localized, are known as Natives or well- 
established Aliens elsewhere within the limits of Britain.

CHAPTER XXII. 

MOSSES. 

Amongst the Mosses a much larger proportion of the species have the 
Montane role of distribution than is the case amongst the plants of the 
higher orders, whilst on the other hand the Xcrophilous and Maritime 
species are very few in number. Wilson's " Bryologia Britannica " has 
been followed as a standard of classification and nomenclature. For an 
explanation of the meaning of the letters A, B, and C, when they follow 
the word "Montane," the reader must refer to page 56, where he will find 
our Montane Flowering Plants and Ferns separated into three classes, 
marked A, B, and C respectively. If the lists there given had been exten- 
ded so as to include the Mosses, the species now distinguished as indicated 
would have been placed side by side with their geographical analogues 
amongst the plants of the higher orders, and it might be worth while for 
anyone who is interested in the subject thus to extend those lists, and 
those of the Xerophilous and Subxerophilous species, for himself. The 
Cybele Britannica docs not include the Mosses. Their distribution 
throughout Britain- is much less thoroughly known than is that of the 
Flowering Plants and Ferns, and I have not therefore attempted to refer 
the species to their "types of distribution," neither have I attempted to 
trace them through the nine drainage districts, and their ascertained ver- 
tical range is stated by means of the Climatic zones, not in leaps of fifty 
yards. In denoting the zones by numbers I have begun from below, so 
that " Range 1-2" means that the species has been observed in the Lower 
and Middle, but not in the Upper zone. And lastly, no category of citi- 
zenship is stated, because no species can be considered as introduced by 
human agency. All that we can safely claim at all, we may, without risk 
of blunder, regard as " Natives."
