This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

IN the flowers of tbis Clafs there are ^fix Chives ; 
four of them long, and iv)o of them (hort. 

The Orders are two, and arc diflinguiflied by the 
figure of the fced-veffel, which in the/r/J Order is a 
PiMfcA ; that is, a roundifli flat feed-veffcl ifurmfhed with 
a ^haft^ which is freqaently as long as the feed-veffel 
itfclf. In the Jtcorul Order, the feed-veflel is a Vod ; that 
is, a very long feed-veffel without any remarkable fliaft. 

The plants of this Glafs admit of the 'following Na- 
TLTRAL Character.

Early in the fpring the Sea Cabbage is preferred before the 
cultivated kinds ; but when gathered on the fea-coaft, it muft 
be boiled in two waters to take away the faltncfs. When old, 
it occafions giddinefs. The roots may be eaten like thofe of the 
preceding fpccics, but they are not fo tender.â€” The induftry of 
the Gardener bath produced a great number of varieties, known 
by the names of Early CahhagCy Winter Cabbage^ Kahy Red 
Caihagfy IVJ^ite Cakbage^ Borecole^ Broccoli^ Turnep-rootcd CahÂ» 
hagty Caulijio^ixfcr^ &c. as may be feen in Millar's Gardener*s Dic- 
tionary. They are all of them much in ufe at our tables. The 
Red Cabbage is chieflv ufed for pickling. In fome countries 
they bury the White Cabbage when full grown in the amumn, 
and thus prefefve it all winter. The Germans cat them to 
pieces and along with fome arorr*atic herbs and fait, prefs them 
dofe down in a tub where they (bon ferment, and are then 
eaten under the name of Sour Crout, â€” The Cabbage whilft 
young, is food for tht 0^fomela Sahatoria^ and afterwards for the 
?afibo BraJJica* The former may be kept off by ftrewing the 
ground with Soot ; and it is faid the latter -will not touch the 
plants if they are whipped with the ereen boughs of El/der. If 
Cabbages are fowed or planted for ftvoral years together in the 
fame foil, the heads become fmaller and the roots knotty. This

The feeds reduced to powder, make the common muftard, to 
much in reque ft at our tables â€” they yield a confidef able quantity 
of exprefTed oil which partakes but little of the acrimony of the 
plant â€” the feeds when unbruifed impart butlittle tafte t6 boiliDg 
water. Taken inwardly in the quantity of a meac-{]^nful or 
more, they gently loofen the bowels, and are of fcrvicc in chronic 
Rheumatifms and Palfies. â€” The powdered feeds curdle milk^ 
and give a ftrong impregnation to boiling water. This infuiion 
taken in confiderable quantity, vomits ; in fmaller dofes it is a 
ufeful aperient and diuretic. Cataplafms formed with crumb 
of breacf, vinegar and powdered muftard-feed are very common- 
]y applied to the foles of the feet as ftimulants, in Fevers that re-

Natural Character, 

Empal. Cwjb one leaf, bell-fhaped ; fhrivclling ; hunched 
at the bafe; the lower part conneflcd with the fruii- 
ftalk ; the up{>er part blunt; containing honey. 
Rim with five teeth ; fharp ; upright ; oblique; un- 
equal. The lower Tooth long, the two upper teeth 
fbortcr and {landing farther afunder. The bottom 
of the cup inclofing the receptacle, is nioiftened 
with a liquor like honey. 

Bloss. Butterfly-fhaped^ unequal ; each petal having ^ 
diftind name. Thus the Standard is the largeft pe- 
tal, lying upon and covering the others. It is flat 
and horizontal ; 6xed by a claw to the upper edge 
of the receptacle; that part of it which ftands out 
of the cup is nearly circular and entire ; a rifing 
line marking it length-ways, particularly towards 
the end, as if it had been preffed down at the fides. 
That part of the petal next to the bafe is fomewhat 
like half a cylinder, and inclofes the patts that lie 
under it. The border of the petal is deprefled on 
each fide, but the fides next to the edge are turned 
upwards, uhere the half cylinder terminates. At 
the unfolding of the border there are two concave 
imprefiions, prominent on the under fide, and com- 
preffing the wings which lie beneath them. 

The wings are two equal petals, one placed on 
each fide the flower under the fiandard. TThe bon- 
ders incumbent; parallel; circular or oblong, broad> 
eft outwaids ; the upper edge pretty ftraight, the 
lower extended and rounded. The bafe of each 
wing is cloven ; the lower Segment extending into a 
claw which is fixed to the fide of the receptacle and 
is about as long as the cup. The upper Segmeni is 
fliorter and bent inwards. 

The Keel is the lowermofl petal, generally divided j 
placed under the ftandard, and betwixt the wings. 
It is boat-lhaped, concave, compreffed at the fides ; 
placed in the pofiiibn of a boat upon the water. It 
is diminiflied at the bafe, the lower part extcnditig 
into a claw as long as the cup, and fixed to the re- 
ceptacle. The upper and lateral fegments, v>hich

are {hotter, arc interwoven with thofe parts of the 
Avings which refemble them in fhape. The fides of 
the keel are (haped Hki the wmgs, and have a Timi- 
lar fittiation only lower and more inwards. The 
line that forms the keel in this petal is ftraight as 
far as the middle, and then gradually rifes in an 
arch; but the marginal line runs ftraight to the ex- 
tremity, until it meets with, and is loft in that of 
the keel.

(hape. The fower Thread inclofmg the pointal, the 
upper Thread lying upon it.

Upper Thread aWl or briftle-lhaped. Similarin fitu- 
ation to, and lying upon the opening of the cylin- 
drical part of the lower thread ; fimple, and a liule 
ihorier than that : feparated from the others at the 
bafc, fo as to give a vent on each fide for the honey. 
Tips ten. One upon the upper thread, nine up- 
on the lower. Small; equal iniize; terminating. 

Point. Single; fuperior.

ower thread, by which it is inclofed. 

Shaft awl-fhaped or thrcad-fhaped ; afcending ; 
agreeing in length and fituation, with the divifions 
of the lower thread and placed amongft them : 
ihri veiling. 

Summit downy as far as it is turned upwards : 
Placed direflly under the tips.

The patient had been tapped three times, and xrycd the ufual re- 
medics before. {MofiUa c/ firacfft, Medica. p. 138.) An jn- 
tufion of the feeds drank freely, has been known to produce 
fimilar happy tSc^Jts : but whoever expeds tliefe eflfe6^s to fol-

vex; pyramidal ; or globular. It is either 

Kiked^ that is, marked only with little dots, as in Dan- 
delion ; or

jf; befct with awl-fliaped, narrow, coroprefled, up- 
right chaffy fubftances, feparating the Florets, as in 
Chamomile or Yarrow. 

The Common Empal. is a Cup which furrounds the 
Florets and the common Receptacle. (When the 
FUntts have Uoffomed it contraSs ; but when the Seeds are 
ripe it expands and Jails back,) It is either 

^pie ; when formed with onfy.a fingle row of fcales or 
Leaves.

Few plants are more dliregarded than this, and yet its ufe is 
very confiderable. If a heap of clay is throwii up, nothing 
would grow upon it for feveral years. If the feeds of this plant, 
wafted by the Wind, did not fix and vegetate thereon. Under 
the ibelrer of this, â€¢ther vegetables appear, and the whole foon 
becomes fertile â€” The flowers, like thole of the Artichoke, have 
the property of Rennet in curdling ^lilk. â€” Shee^ and Swine re- 
fufc it ; neither Horfes, Cows or Goats are fond it â€” The painted 
Lady Butterfly, PaflUo Cardui, and the Thiille Ermine Moth, 
feed upon it.

The leaves and flowers have a ftrong, not ungrateful fmell, 
and a bitter naufeous tafte. They afford an eflential oil. â€” An 
infufion of the flourers is often ufed as a ftomachic and as an anti- 
fpafmodic. In large Quantities it excites vomiting â€” The pow- 
dered flowers, in large aofes, have cured Agues, even when the 
Bark had failed â€” ^th the leaves and flowers poflefs very confi- 
dcrable antifceptic properties, and are therefore ufed in antifccp- 
tic fomentations, and poultices. From their antifpa(modic oowers^ 
they are frequently found to relieve pain, eirther applied exter- 
nally, or taken internally.

THIS Clafs is diftinguifiicd by ilic Chives being 
placed upon the Shaft, or upon the Recepuult 
lengthened out into the form of 4 Shaft, fupportiog 
both the Fointal and the Chives^ and entering into part 
of the pointal. 

The firft Order of this Clafs is natural, and its Ge- 
nera arc diftinguifhed by the Honey-cup alone. The 
firudure of the flowers is very (ingular. 

Seedbud always below the bloflbm, twilled like a fcrcw. 
Petals five ; the two inner ones generally approaching 

fo as to referable a helmet. A Honey-cup forms the 

lower lip and occupies the place of the pointal, and 

of a bxth petal. 
Shaft fixed to the inner edge of the honey^cup, fo as to 

be fcarce diftinguifhable ; as is likewife the Sumrnit, 
Threads always two ; very Ihort ; fupporting t^voTlPs; 

more flender below ; without any coat ; divifiblc

The reader in examining andl comparing the charafiers 
of this clafs, Taould always attend to the Ptintal before 
the Chives, in order to attain a diilinA idea of th^ fi* 
tuation of the latter. 

The flowers of this Clafs have a very fingular appear- 
ance, owing to the unfual difpofition of their compo- 
nent parts. 

A very ingenious gentleman at Worcefler, to whofc 
judgment and accuracy 1 have been much indebted ia 
ibe couffe of this work, has favoured roe with the fol> 
lowing remarks upon the flrufture of the Chives in the 
firft Order of this Clafs.â€” The Gmjves are^ evidently 
two : but each of them appears to be compofed of a 
njimbcr of elaftic Fibres united together ; each Fibre fup- 
poriing its own proper Tip, Thefc Fibres I call elaftic ; 
for if you prefs down the bottom of the Chive with a 
needle or any other inftrument, and draw another needle 
along the Chive, prefling it with fome force, you may 
extend the Chive to twice its forxner length: but no 
fooner do you remove the force applied, than the fibres 
contraft with an elaftic force, and the Chive returns to 
its former (hape. This you may repeat, and the efied 
will be conftantly the fame. 

Tbefe fibres branch out into lelfer ones, each fup- 
porting at its point an extremely minute Tip. Thefe 
tips I have examined inihe microfcope, and found fome of 
them roundifh and others nearly triangular. The Du/t 
which thefe probably contained 1 was not able to dif^ 
cover.

Mf. Moult, in a letter to Dr. Percival inferred in the PhiJof^ 
Tranf. vol. 59. p. 1. defcribes his method of making Salep. 
The beft' tinnre to gather the roots, he obferves^ is when the 
feed is formed, and the flalk is going to faM ; for then the new 
bulb, of which Salep is made', is arrived at its full fize. This 
new root beirig feparated from the flalk, is to be wafted in wa^r, 
and the outer thm ikin taken oÂ£ They are then to be fet on a 
. fin plate tn an oven beared to i\\t degree of a bread-oven. In 
fix, eight or ten minutes they will have acquired a tranfparertcy 
like horn, but without being diminifhed in fize.* They are theii 
to be removed into another room to dry and harden, which Will 
be done in a few days : or they may be iinilhed In a very'dowr 
hear in a few hours. 

Salep thus prepared, may be fold for lefs than a Jhilling Ji 
pound, and aflPords a mild nutriment which in tinws of fcarciiy, 
to cafes of Dyfentcry and Strangury, and on ihip board may be 
extremely ufcful. See Perd*ual*j FJJays. part, ^.p^^J-

fir the purpofe, and it is highly probwble thatlerciy fpccics of 
Orchis nwjT be uApd iDdifcrimmately. Salep has been hitherto , 
imported troni Turkey at a confiderable price, buf it is to bci 
hoped^ we (h&Il no longer be fupplied from foreign markets, with 
iQ article that our own country can fupply us with in iilmoft any 
quantity. If ever plantations of it are made^ the plants mull 
be propa^ted by roots, for the {^ccds feldom come to perfedlion. 
Dr. Percival obferves that he got fome feeds to all appearance 
perfcfl, but yet they would not vegetate. Is it that the warnjth 
of our climate being infufficient fully to expand the bloflbm, the 
tips are never releafed from their confinement in theceUs form- 
ed by the upper lip of the honey -cup, and therefore the duA 
can never efcape to fertilize' the feedbud ?

The root and the leaves when recent, are fo extremely acrid 
that is it highly difagreeable to tafle them. The root has 
been employed in medicine as a ilimulant, but when re* 
daced to powder it lofes much of its acrimony, and there is 
reafon to fuppofe that the compound powder which takes its 
name from that plant, owes its virtues chiefly to the other in- 
gredients. There is no doubt but this acrid quality may be 
turned to very ufeful purpofes, but we muft firft learn how to 
ifcertain its dofe. â€” The root dried and powdered, is ufed by the 
French to wa(h their Ikin with. It is fold at a higli price under 
thcnameofCyprefs Powder. It is undoubtedly a good, and an 
innocent cofmetic. â€” When the acrimoiiy of the roots is extra^- 
ed either by boiling or baking, they certainly will aflbrd a very 
mild and wholefome nourifhment. Many nations prepare the 
only bread they have, from plants as acrimonious as this ; firft 
diffipating the noxious qualities by the force of heat. â€” Starch 
may be made ftom the roots.

ALL the Clafles hitherto mentioned, are compofed of 
Plants, whofe Flowers contain the Chives and the 
hifUals within the fame empalement ; but the plants of 
this Clals have the Chives in one flower, or in one em- 
palement, and the Pointals in another. The flowers that 
contain the Chives are Barren; thofe that contain the 
Pointals are Fertile. The Barrtn and the Fertile flowers 
of this Clafs, are always found upon the fame plant. 

From this account it. is evident, that in giving, the 
Generic charaflers, it is neceflary to defcribe both the 
Barren, and the Fertile Flowers, Therefore 
B fignifiei ihcBatren Flower or that with Chives only; and 
F fignifies the Fertile Flower^ or that with only Pointals. 

Ob$. Florets hclofed in a Common Empalement, though agree- 
ing in the difpofition of the Chinees and Pointals ; arc not to be re 
ferred to this Clafs, This caution is necejfary in order to exclude 
fnuofthe Rundlc bearing Plants of the lifth, and foms of tbs

to convey water under ground, which will laft longer than Elm 
or Oakâ€” Scyne of the oldell buildings in London are faid co be 
conftrui^ed with this woodâ€” At Tortworth in Gloucederfhire 
there is a tree fifty-two feet round. It is proved to have flood 
there ever lince the year 1 1 50, and was then fo remarkable at 
to be called the great Chefnut of Tortworth. It fixes the boun- 
dary of the manor, and is probably near 1000^ years old. See 
Gent. Mag. 1766 p* 32I9 where there is a drawing of it. Mr. 
G)llinfon, the author of this account, makes no doubt of rhe 
Chefnut being a native of England, and affigns the great profit 
that arifes from them when ciit for hop-poles, as the reafon why 
it is fo rare to fee large trees in the woods. The nuts arc uled 
for whitening linen cluth, and for making flarcb.

It loves hilly better than boggy ground, and thrives bed,.

the earth, and therefore will not bear to be tranfplantcd. Much

wood is hard ; tough ; tolerably flexible ; not eafily fplintering ;

beautiful wood is required for inlaying or Haining; It is a 
praÂ£tice in Italy to put the chips of hazle into turbid wine 
to clear it, which it does in twenty-four hours : and in coun- 
tries where yeall is fcarce, they take the twigs of hazle, 
and twift them together fo as to be full of chinks; thefe they 
ilcep in ale during its fermentation ; then hang them up to dry, 
and vvhen they brew again they put them into the the wort in- 
Head of yeaft â€” Painters and engravers prepare coals for de- 
lineating their dcfigns thus. They take pieces of Hazle about as 
thick as a man's arm and four or five inches long, dry and then 
cleave. them into pieces about as thick as ones finger. Thefe 
they 'put into a large pot full of fand, and then cover the top of 
pot with clay. This is expofed in a potter's oven, or any other 
fufiicicnt degree of heat, and when cooled again, the flicks are 
found converted into charcoal which draws freely and eafily rubs 
out again â€” The uuts are agreeable 10 mod people. Si[uirrels

It flourifties bed in a poor Tandy foil. Tn a grove, the trunk 
becomes tall and naked ; in funny open places, branched. On

beconaes difcafed, and in chalky land it dies. Sometimes it will 
thrive near running, but never near {lagnant waters. None 
but the terminating buds fend forth branches, therefore it will 
not bear the leaft clipping. The roots fprtad very near to the 
furface of the earth, ail but the central root which grows per- 
pendicularly downwards ; and if this is broken off, or interrupt-

It loves a moifi and open liruation ; grows quick, <ind bears 
loppingâ€” The Reverend Mr. Stone, in the Phil^f, Tranf. rd. 
S3-Pr '9.S' gives us an account of the great efficacy of the 
bark of this tree in curing intermitting Fevers. He gathers the 
bark in fummer, when it is full of fap ; dries it by a gentle 
heat, and gives a dram of it powdered every four hours betwixt 
the fits. In a few obftinatc cafes he mixed it with one fifth part 
of Peruvian bark. It is remarkable that intermittents are mofl 
prevalent in wet countries ; and this tree grows naturally in fuch 
lituations. Whilil the Peruvian bark remained at its ufual mo- 
derate price it was hardly worth while to feek for a fubftitute ; 
but now its price is more than doubled, and the fupply from 
South America hardly equal to the confumpiion, we may expe<?t 
to find it dearer and more adulterated every year. The Jiljite 
Willow Bark is therefore likely to become an object worth the 
attention of phyficians, and ifitsfuccefs upon a more enlarged 
fcale of practice proves equal to Mr. Stone's experiments, the 
world will be much indebted to that gentleman for his communi- 
cation â€” This bark will tan leatherâ€” Horfes, Cows, Sheep and 
Goats eat it. The

It is found upon Willows, Oaks, Hazels, Peartrees, and

Birdlime may be made from the berries and from the bark â€” 
The Miflctoc Bird, the Fieldfare, and the Thrufh eat the ber- 
ries, the feeds of which pafs through them unchanged, and 
along with their excrements adhere to the branches of trccs^ 
where they vegetate. Some authors obferving th^at the roots 
are always inferted on the under fide of the branches, deny this 
method of propagation ; but they do not recollcdl that the rains 
will foon wafh them into that fituation, though It is highly pro- 
bable that they firft fell upon the upper fide of the branch â€” No 
an hath yet been invented to make thefe phnts take root in the 
eanhâ€” Mifletoe was formerly in great repute as a remedy for 
Epileptic and other complaints ; but it is now very much difre- 
gardcd ; and indeed its fenfible cjualities proraife but little. 
Some remains of Druidical fuperftitions probably gave binh to 
its medical fame, and an opiriion which many people are fund 
to entertain, (viz.) that every climate produces remedies to

It grows in fenile or in barren foils ; on^ hills of in valleys ; in 
open fandy plains, or in raoift and clofe woods. On the fides of 
hills its trunk grows long ; but on the tops of rocky mountains 
and on bog* it is little better than a ihrub. It is eafily tranf- 
planted and it bears cropping. Grafs will not grow beneath itÂ» 
but the Meeuio^ Oat deltroys it â€” The wood is hard and durable. 
The bark may be made into ropes â€” The berries are two years in 
ripening. When bruifed they aflbrd a pleafaui diuretic liquor, but 
it is not ealy to prevent its growing four. It is efteemed a good 
andicorbatic. The Swedes prepare an extraÂ£l from the berries 
which fomc people eat for breakfaft, but it is fitter for a medicine 
than for food. The fpirit impregnated with the eflential oil of 
thcfe berries is every where known by the name of Gin, or 
Juniper water â€” The berries fometimes appear in an uncommon 
form> the leaves of the eup grow double the ufual fize ; ap- 
proaching, but not clofing; and the three petals fit exadly 
clofc, fo as to keep the air trom the Tifules Jumperi which inha- 
bit them â€” Gum candarach, more comnrwnly called Pounce, Js

It grows bed in a moid loamy foiL On bogs or dry inoun* 
tains It languifhes. It bears traufplanting erten when old. It 
is often planted to make bedge<t, and as thefe hedges admit of 
clipping, they form excellent ikreens to keep off the cold windi 
from tender plants â€” The wood is hard, fmooth, and beautifully 
veined with red. It is converted into bows, axle-trees, fpoons 
cups, cogs for mill wheels arid flood-gates for iiih-ponds which 
hardly ever decay â€” ^The berries are fwcet, and vifcid. Children 
often eat them in large quantities without any inconvenienceâ€” 
The frcfh leaves are fatal to the human fpecies. Cattle arc

CLASS XXIV, 



UNDER this Clafs are arranged a number of Ve- 
getables whofe Flowers are either but little known, or 
whofe Chives and Pointals arc too minute to admit of 
that mode of inveftigation which prevails through the 
twenty-three Clafles preceding. The (Iru^lure too of thefe 
vegetables differs conGderably from that of other plants. 
They are divided into four Natural Orders. (vizÂ») Ferns ; 
Mosses; Thonc3 ; and Funcusses. 

FERNS. 

The plants of this order fometimes have their flowers 
in fpikes, as in the Horsetail (Plate L A.) but they 
arc generally difpofcd in fpots or lines on the under fur- 
face of the leaves, as in the Harts-tongue, Plate I. B. 

Empal. a fcalc fpringing out of the leaf: opening on 
one fide. Underneath this fcale, fupported upon 
little foot-ftalks, are 

Globes, encompaffed by an elaftic ring, which burlls 
with violence, and fcatters a powder. 

OBSERVATIONS, 

The feedvcffels on the under furfacc of the leaves 
are covered by a very fine, thin, fcmi-tranfparent (kin, 
\vhich' tears open before the feeds ripen. The feed-veflels 
themfelves arc compofed of three parts. FirfK a little 
fruit-ftalK, by meai;is of which they are connefled with 
the furface of the leaf. Second, a globular Capfule 
ftanding upon the fruit-ftalk. Third, an elaftic cord, 
fixed to the top of the fruit-ftalk and furrounding the 
4[^pfule. When the Seeds itc ripe, the cord endeavours 

to

to become ftraight, and by its elafticity tears open the 
Capfule. The Capfule opens lite that of the Pimper- 
nel, as if it had been cut rouud with a knife, forming 
two hollow hemifpherical caps. The elaftic force which 
tears it open, difperfes the feeds abroad. Thefe are lb 
minnte as hardly to be vifible to the naked eye. In the 
monihs of September and Odober this curious mecha- 
nifm is very evident in the Common Brakes or in the 
Haru-tongue Spleenwort, by the affiftance of a good 
fingic Microfcope with a reiieding Speculum. The fud- 
den jerk of the fpringing cord frequently carries the ob- 
jcd out of the held of view, fo that it requires fome 
patience to obferve the whole of the procefs. 

As there are no certain diftindions in the Flowers 
themfelves fuflficient to eftablifh the Genera, wc are 
guided by their difpofition under their covers. 

Few of the FERNS are efculent. They have a heavy 
difagreeable fmelL In larges dofes they defiroy worm^, 
aad are purgative. 

MOSSES. 

This Order is fubdividcd according as the Tips have 
a Veil or no Veil : as they are upon the fame plant with 
the PoiNTAL, or upon different plants ; and as the 
Pointals zxcjolitarj or incorporated. The 

SEEDS confift only of a Heart without any Coat or 
Seed-lobes, The 

Tips according to Linnxus are rather to be confidered 
as Capfules^ and the Duft which they contain as 
the real feeds ; for within the cover of fome of 
them he thinks he has obferved real Tips hang- 
ing by threads, opening at the end, and letting 
fall a Duft upon the hairs of the fringed ring, 
which he feems to conCdcr as fo many Pointals.

OBSERVATIONS. 

â€¢ 

It has beta doubted whcthor the powder in the headt 
of Mofles is the Duft or the &e$is. but as the ditft of all 
plants explodes in water and fla&es in the flasneofa 
candle ; and as this powder poflfefles thefe properties, 
there can no longer be a doubt what to call it. ' Thefe 
' Moffes then with heads or tips fumiflied with daft, am 
the barren plants; and except in the Genus Glimmosi, 
they have no Thuads^ but a Tip only; which in many 
of them is covered with a Veil or Lid. The Sods of 
Moffes are therefore to be fought for in the Fertile PlantSf 
and are fufficiently evident in the Fir Globmoss. 

The Fringe that furrounds the mouth of the rip in moft 
of the Moffes, feeras to aniwer the fame, or at leaft a 
fimtlar purpofe to the down which crowns the feeds of the 
c'hvnpound flowers in the nineteenth Clois. Before the 
veil and the lid fall off, the little hairs which compofetbe 
fringe lie flat over the mouth of the tip, meeting in the 
center like the fpokes of a wheel. If the lid is taken off 
by force when the tip is nearly ripe, thefe hairs imme- 
diately rife np and expand horizontally. Now in the 
natural progrefs of things as the tip becomes mature, is it 
not the expanfion of this fringe which throws off the 
lid and opens a paffage for the duft ? I am indebted for 
this remark to a young gentleman who will probably one 
day clear up much of the darknels in which this nu- 
merous and negleded tribe of plants are ftill invelopcd; 
imd confequcntly reduce tliem to a fyflem fomething 
iDore fcieml&c than what we now can boaft of. 

The Fertile Flowers, or rather Seeds, in feveral Ge- 
nera are totally undifcovered ; but in others they arc 
fuppofed to exill on the inncrtcle at the bafe of the leaves, 
in certain ftarry or cone-like flioots. In plate I. C is a 
fbopt of one of the Moffes. D is a fiower.bearing fialk ; 
{a) the veil ; [c) the tip ; (b) the lid. 

Moffes thrive beft in barren places. Moft of them love 
cold and moifture. Trifling and infignificant as many 
people think them, their ules are by no means inconli- 
derable. They pioteci the more tender plants when they 
firft begin to expapd in the fpring, as the experience of 
the Gardiner can tellify, which teaches him to cover with

Mob the foil and pots that contain his tenderefl plants ; 
^r it equally defends the roots again the fcorching fun- 
beams and thefcverity of the froft. In. the fpring, when- 
the fun has conCderable power in the day-time and the 
frofts at night are fevere ; the roots of young trees and 
flirubt are liable to be thrown out of the ground, parti- 
cularly in light fpongy foils. But if they are covered 
with Mofs, this accident never can happen. Thofe who / 

are fond of railing trees from feeds, will find their in* 
terefi in attending to this remark. 

Mofles retain moifiure a long time without being dif- 
pofed to putrefy. The angler takes advantage of this 
circumftanc^ to preferve his worms, and the gardener to 
keep moift the roots of fuch plants as are to be tranf- 
poned to any conGderable diflance. 

It is a vulgar error to fi^ppofe that Modes impoverifli 
land. It is true they â€¢ grow upon poor land tnat can 
fupport nothing elfe ; but their roots penetrate very 
little, in general hardly a quarter of an inch into the 
earth. Take away the Mofs, and infteaU of more grafs . 
you will have lefs ; but manure and drain the land ; the 
grafs will increafe and the Mofs difappear. 

The Grey BocMOS^, the Triangular Marshmoss, the 
dwarf and water Threadmoss, the hooked, fcorpion, 
floating and pointed Feathermoss, grow upon the fides 
and Ihallower parts of pools and marlhcs ; and in pro- 
cefs of time ; occupying the fpace heretofore filled with 
water, are in their half decayed ftate dug up and ufed 
as fuel under the name of Peat. Thefe marfties, drained 
partly by human induftry, and partly by the long con- 
tinued operations of vegetables, are at length converted 
into fertile meadows. 

Very few Moffes ar^ eaten by cattle. The Bifhpp 
Moth ;ind the Bcu&els Lace Moth feed upon fome of 
them. Their medicinal virtues are but little known, and 
lefs attended to. Some of the fpecies will probably be 
found very aflive, and therefore ufeful medicines.

THONGS. 

The plants comprifed under this divifion fcarccly ad- 
mit of a diftinAion of root, ftem and leaf; much lefs 
arc wc enabled to defcribe the parts of the flowers. The 
Genera therefore are diftinguiflied by the ficiiation of 
what we fuppofc to be the flowers or feeds, or by the 
refemblance of the whole plant to fome other fubilance 
wc arc well acquainted with. 

Linnxus calls the plants of this Order Sea-weeds, but 
with no great propriety ; for veiy few of the Genera 
have any thing to do with the fca. We rather choofe 
to call themTnoNcs, becaufe the fubftance of moft of 
ibcm is more or lefs like leather, and many of them arc 
in the form of Thongs. In plate ift. E. and F. are fpe- 
cimens of one of the Genera, and G. oÂ£ another. 

Thefe plants, though generally looked upon as un- 
worthy of notice, are of great confcquence in the ceco- 
nomy nature, and aflTord the lirft foundation for vege- 
tation. Thus one fpecies of the Powderwort, and fe- 
veral fpecies of the Cupthong fix upon the bareft rooks 
and are nouriflied by what (lender fupply the air and the 
rains afford theiu. When thefe die,ihcy arc converted.into 
a very fine earth in which the tiled Cupthongs find nour- 
iftiment, and^hen thefe putrify and fall to duft, va- 
rious Mofles, as the Tiireadmoss, Feathermoss, &:c. 
occupy their place; and in length of tine N*hen thefe 
perifn in their turn, there is a fufficiency of foil in which 
trees and other plants take root. This procefs of nature 
is fufiiciently apparent upon the fmooth and barrea 
rocks upon ihe fca-fliore. 

Some of the Oarweeds arc efculcnt. 

Manyof the Cupthongs are a grateful food to Goats; 
and the Rein-deer, which conllitutcs the whole occo- 
nprny of the Laplanders, and fupports many thoufand 
inhabitants, lives upon one of the fpecies. Many of tl c 
fpecies afford colours for dying. One of them brought 
from the Canary Iflands, viz. the Orchel, or Argol, 
makes a very confiderablc article of traffic. It is not 
improbable that fome of the fpecies growing in our own 
ifland may afford very beauful and ufeful colours ; but 
this matter hath not been fufficicntly examined. Mr.

HcUot gives us the following procefs for difcovering whe- 
ther any of thefe plants will yield a red or purple colour. 
"â€¢ Put about a quarter of an ounce of the plant in qucftion 
'' imo a fmall glafs ; moiftctt it well with equal parts of 
'* flrong Lime-water and fpirit of Sal Ammoniac ; or the \ 
'' Spirit of Sal Amranoniac made with quick-lime will do 
'' without Lime-water. Tye a wet bladder clofe over 
** the top of the veflel and let it ftand three or four days. 
*^ If any colour is likely to be obtained, the fmall 
^' quantity of liquor you will find in the glafs will be of 
'' a deepxrimfon red ; and the plant will retain the fame 
" colour when the liquor is all dried up. If neither the 
'^ Uquornor the plant have taken any colour, it is need- 
" Icfs to make any further tryals with it."

All the Genera under this divifion, particularly the 
PuFFBALL and AlouLD, abound with a black powder, 
which examined with a good microfcope is found to con- 
fift of globules which are fuppofed to be the feeds. But 
the Baron Otto Munckhause.v fays thefe globules are 
femi-tranf parent, containing a little black particle- He 
fays too that if this powder is mixed with water and kept 
in a warm place, tlie globules prefently fwcil and arv: 
changed into egg-fliaped felf-moving animalcules. In 
about two days thefe animalcules unite and form a mais 
ofa pretty firm texture, or Fungus. When thefe Fungufies 
begin to grow, they appear like white veins, which are 
commonly fuppofed to be the roots; but in fafl they are 
only tubes in which the animalcules move, andinafliort 
time are transformed imo a Fungus, which with plenty 
ol* moifture, and a proper degree of warmt'i gro\^s to a 
very large fize.' The black powder found bctwix the 
gills of Muflirooms, produces the fame phxnomcna.

difcoveries in many abftrufc parts of the animal and ve- 
getable kingdoms, do him the higheft honour, undei- 
took the fubjed ; and foon demonftrated that the motion 
of thefe globules is occafioned by a number of very 
minute animaicula feeding upon them; but the animal- 
cula being much fmaller than the globules are difficult 
to deted. See Thilof. Tranf. vol. 59. p. 138. See alfo 
Gent. Mag. for 1773. P*3i6. 

FungufFes have been fought for as food, upon account 
of their high flavour ; but nobody fuppofes them to yield 
good nourifhment ; and many have been killed by them. 
Some of them have been found of confiderable ufe in 
flopping haemorrhages, and the acrimonious qualities of 
others will probably fomeday be turned to good accounts

The root dried, powdered, and given in dofes of half an 
ounce, is a fecret to kill the Tape-worm, and is fuppofed to be 
no Itfs elficacious in killing other Worms â€” A tolerably pure 
aikaly is obtained from the afhes. The common people in iiiaiiy 
parts cf England mix the alhes with water and form them into 
balls : thefe balls are afterwards made hot in the fire and then 
ufcd to make lye for fcouring linen â€” It malces a very durable 
-thatch ; and is an excellent litter for Horfes and Cows. Where 
coal is fcnrce, they ufe it to heat ovens and to burn limeflooe; 
for it affords a very violent hear. In the more inhofpitable 
climates, bread is made of the roots. â€” The Fern Moth feeds

mination ot the branches. They are almo^ tiianfparent, and 
when magnified the Seeds are vjlible within rhem if the plant is

colle<^ed into Catkins, which iLuid on the tcrtninations of the
