PREFACE. 



1 HE title of Flora, first used by Linders and Rup- 
pius^ early in the eighteenth century, to designate 
an account of the native plants of some particular 
country, has become popular in the Linnaean school 
of Botany, and is now universally adopted. Books 
bearins: this title are almost innumerable, while their 
scope and their merits are equally various. Some 
are little more than catalogues of names ; others are 
elaborate histories of the vegetable productions of 
particular districts, more or less extensive; and many 
are illustrated with figures of the several species, or 
at least of those requiring particular elucidation. 
The utility of such publications has been much con- 
troverted ; but it depends, like that of other works, 
on the excellence of their plan and execution. A 
mere list of the plants of any country, if accurate 
and complete, has its appropriate value ; more espe- 
cially when it contains the discriminative charac- 
ters by which such plants may be ascertained. But 
a Flora may also be made a vehicle for the natural, 
medical, and economical history of a country, like 
the Flora Lapponica of Linnaeus ; though such ob- 
jects cannot with propriety enter into the plan of a 
Flora of any highly improved or well-known region. 
We now therefore expect, under this title, a work 



Vi P U E F A C E. 

chiefly confined to botanical illustration and descrip- 
tion, witli such remarks concerning the properties of 
any particular plants as may be new or important ; 
and possibly some philosophical views arising from 
the nature of the subject, tending to the general 
elucidation of botanical science. Such only are the 
pretensions of this English Flora, the particular aim 
and design of which, with respect to practical use, 
will hereafter be explained. 

Before the author enters on this explanation, he 
proposes to take a general view of the works which 
have been published on the Botany of Great Britain ; 
in order that the student, who will meet with per- 
petual references to these books in the following 
pages, may previously become acquainted with them, 
and with the characters of their authors. He may 
thus learn which of them may be dispensed with, 
in the prosecution of his own studies, and which 
are most likely to assist him, in any difficult or 
doubtful subject of inquiry. They will be noticed 
in a chronological order, to show the progress of 
Botany in this country, and how far each writer has 
been indebted to his predecessors. Some remarks 
of a similar nature, by the author of the present 
work, were laid before the Linngean Society, five- 
and-twenty years ago, and are printed in the fourth 
volume of its Transactions. They were preparatory 
to the publication of his Latin Flora Britannica, and 
served as an introduction to a critical history of the 
genus Brotnus, whose British species had previously 
been little understood. 

Phytologia Britannica, by William How, M.D., 
printed at London in 1650, without the author's 



PREFACE. Vll 

name, claims attention as the first general catalogue 
of our native plants. This is a duodecimo volume 
of 133 pages. The species are disposed alphabeti- 
cally, and amount to about 1250, including several 
exotic plants in general cultivation, w^ith numerous 
varieties of such as are truly wild. The names of 
many are very erroneous, even among those most 
easily determined, and many are, doubtless, admit- 
ted on insufficient grounds. But, on the other hand, 
several rare and curious species are noticed, not 
without some entertaining and instructive remarks 
and anecdotes. The same author in 1655 edited 
Lobel's Illustrationes, a work not confined to British 
plants, and chiefly aimed at certain errors of Park- 
inson, Dr. How died in 1656, aged 37. His book 
was the foundation of the following. 

Pinas Rerum Naturalium Britarmicarum, by 
Christopher Merrett, M.D., an octavo of 223 pao-es, 
of which 165 are allotted to the Vegetable Kingdom, 
appeared in 1667. The number of plants mentioned 
in this work is not much greater than in the preced- 
ing ; for though several species or varieties are added, 
several are unaccountably omitted. Its plan and ar- 
rangement are the same. Ray, in one of his letters, 
calls this publication " Dr. Merrett's blundering 
PiniLV ;" an expression which appears harsh, if we 
judge Merrett as an original author, because few 
naturalists, at the time he lived, could have been 
expected to succeed better in a first attempt. But 
when it is considered how much assistance he 
derived, not only from the above performance of 
Dr. How, but likewise from the local catalogues or 
Itineraries of Johnson, the Catalogue of Cambridc'-e 



VUl PREFACE. 

plants published in 1660 by Ray, as well as from 
various botanical friends, all which he very hand- 
somely acknowledges, we cannot but confess that 
his work might have been more abundant in matter, 
and more correct in execution. Dr. Merrett contri- 
buted little besides this publication to the advance- 
ment of natural history. He however became a 
Fellow of the Royal Society, when science was emi- 
nently requisite for the attainment of that honour, 
and died at the age of 81 in 1695. 

The above-mentioned works, whatever might be 
their value or their defects, were superseded in 1670 
by the great Ray's Catalogus Plantarum Anglice et 
Insularum adjacentium, an octavo of 358 pages ; of 
which a second edition, of only 311 pages, though 
enriched with about 46 additional plants, and nu- 
merous observations, as well as with two, not very 
important, plates, appeared in 1677. The arrange- 
ment of this work is alphabetical ; but with respect 
to accuracy, and abundance of descriptive, critical 
and medical remarks, it has greatly the advantage 
of the performances of How and Merrett. 

A small Fasciculus of new-discovered British 
plants, consisting of 27 pages, and intended as a 
supplement to this Catalogue, was published by Ray 
in 1688. 

This was succeeded in 1690 by the first edition 
of the Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum 
of the same author, in which the plants of Britain 
were first classed in scientific order, according to a 
system of his own ; an explanation of which he had 
already given to the world in 1682, in a small oc- 
tavo volume. 



PREFACE. , IX 

A second edition of Ray's Synopsis, considerably 
enlarged, appeared in 1696, consisting of 346 pages. 
As this is the most accurate and most valuable work 
of its immortal author, the foundation of every sub- 
sequent English Flora, and scarcely equalled in any 
age or country for correctness of practical observa- 
tion, it cannot be too frequently studied by those 
who wish to trace the origin and progress of our in- 
digenous Botany ; to ascertain the aborig'mes of our 
Flora ; to become acquainted with the persons who 
first cultivated this department of science, in En- 
gland, and with the principal scenes which they 
have now rendered classical ; as well as with the 
manner in which their studies were conducted, in 
the closet or the field. It will be observed that nei- 
ther Ray nor any other writer, at this time, attempted 
uniformity of nomenclature, or any regular plan of 
definition. Each plant is mentioned under one or 
more descriptive appellations, taken from various 
books, being probably such as Ray himself judged 
most likely to give, collectively, a just idea of the 
species in question. Even Caspar Bauhin, who 
had published a universal synoptical work, as an in- 
dex to all the botanical knowledge then extant, is 
not quoted uniformly. His names are generally in- 
dicated, but they do not take the lead. New species 
are introduced under original definitions ; and in- 
deed there are few of the old ones which the author 
has not elucidated by some remark, wherever he 
found occasion. The pages, or figures, of preceding 
authors are not indicated by Ray. This was soon 
afterwards practised by Tournefort, and is now be- 
come indispensable. Ray appears to have examined 



PREFACE. 



every plant he admitted into his Synopsis, and to 
have gathered most of them with his own hands. 
He studied and determined their synonyms, com- 
pared their descriptions, and, tracing their natural 
affinities and characters, by the parts of fructification 
as well as by the general habit, he disposed the whole 
in systematic order. He was rarely deceived in the 
observation of nature, and was only occasionally mis- 
led, by the imperfect figures or descriptions of pre- 
ceding writers. Above 100 species are added, in this 
edition, to the list of British plants. 

The third edition of Ray's Synopsis was published 
in 1724, nineteen years after his death, by the cele- 
brated Dillenius, a German botanist, brought into 
England by William Sherard, formerly British Con- 
sul at Smyrna, who by his will founded the Botani- 
cal Professorship at Oxford, and appointed Dille- 
nius the first Professor. The editor modestly de- 
clined prefixing his own name to this book, as being 
a foreigner. In a letter to Dr. Richardson, printed 
in the Linncean Correspondence*, vol. 2. 130, he ac- 
knowledges his obligations to that gentleman and to 
Consul Sherard, as having principally contributed to 
the perfection of this publication ; and in the work 
itself he every where commemorates those who have 
given him particular assistance, especially with 
regard to the native stations of the rarer species. 
Twenty-four plates, drawn and engraved by the 
editor, are added to this edition, which is the only

PREFACE. XI 

One in general use, being always referred to by Lin- 
naeus, and quoted throughout by Hudson, and most 
subsequent writers upon British plants ; particularly 
in the Fhra B)^itamiica and English Botany, as well 
as in every page of the present work, Dillenius has, 
very properly, distinguished all his own additions 
to the Si/nopsis, by marking his new species with an 
asterisk, and inclosing his remarks between brackets. 
This ought to be kept in mind, for the perfect un- 
derstanding of the work ; and yet we not unfre- 
quently find his observations, and even his figures, 
criticized, as coming from Ray. The changes made 
in the synonyms of this edition are unfortunately 
not marked ; and as they are often erroneous, those 
botanists who are studious of truth and precision 
must have recourse to the edition of 1696. Dille- 
nius has indeed added several plants on insufficient 
grounds, either as species or natives, some of them 
beinsf under different denominations in the ori spinal 
work. Such mistakes, into which very able men 
may readily fall, have from time to time been cor- 
rected by following writers. The subject has now 
-passed thrice under the inspection of the author of the 
present English Flora, not altogether surely without 
advantage, and yet certainly without being brought 
to perfection. 

The third edition of Ray's Synopsis was long the 
standard book of English botanists, and its nomen- 
clature, however imperfect, was in daily use. The 
system of this author, indeed, scarcely served for the 
technical examination of plants ; nor was it often 
adverted to by those who, from long habit, preferred 
his names to the more concise ones of Linnaeus. 



XII PRE F ACE. 

But this was far from beino- the case with unshackled 
inquirers; and those who were led to the study of 
Botany by the facility of the Linnaean system, could 
not proceed far without perceiving the superior sim- 
plicity and accuracy of nomenclature, as well as of 
definition, which pervaded all the works of the same 
author. A small party of ingenious and learned 
men at Norwich, as recorded in the seventh volume 
of the Linnsean Society's Transactions, p. 295, in 
correspondence with Mr. Hudson and his able friend 
Stillingfleet, entered, with awakened zeal and im- 
proved principles, upon the cultivation of this an- 
cient field of natural science. Several naturalists of 
distinguished ability, in and about the metropolis, 
pursued the same path. Mr. Lee of Hammersmith, 
at the suggestion and with the assistance of the ac- 
complished Lady Ann Monson, published, in' 1760, 
his Introduction to Botany, in which the principles 
of the great Swedish teacher were first fully ex- 
plained to the English student. In the same year 
Dr. Hill put forth his Flora Britannica, illustrated by 
a reimpression of the plates of Dillenius, and five 
additional ones of his own. The classification and 
generic characters of Linnaeus are here adopted, 
but not his system of nomenclature, nor, with any re- 
gularity, his specific definitions. The body of the 
work is the third edition of Ray's Synopsis, almost in 
its original form. We cannot help wondering that 
Hill did not take advantage of an inauo-ural disser- 
tation, published under the Presidency of Linnaeus 
at Upsal, in 1754, bearing the title of Flora Anglica, 
in which the plants of the Synopsis, with a reference 
to its pages, are disposed according to the system 



PREFACE. Xlll 

of Linnaeus, under the names of his Species Planta- 
rimi, the obscure ones being thrown into an appen- 
dix. This dissertation, however incomplete, was 
the first Linnaean Flora of our country. It was 
doubtless consulted by Hudson, and his coadjutor 
Stillingfleet, in the far more perfect work of which 
I shall presently speak, and which became the uni- 
versal text-book of British botanists. 

Several attempts had been made, before the Lin- 
naean system came into notice, to furnish the stu- 
dents of English plants with a systematic manual, 
in our native language ; and these, though now ob- 
solete, ought not to pass unnoticed. 

Professor Marty n the elder, in 1732, accommo- 
dated Tourneforf s History of plants growing about 
Paris, to the plants of Britain, in English, with many 
additions. Mr. John Wilson published at Newcastle, 
in 1744, a Synopsis of British plants in Mr. Ray's 
method. The authors of these performances were 
practical botanists, though their books rank but as 
compilations, and are now obsolete. Petiver illus- 
trated Ray's Synopsis with a set of seventy-two folio 
plates, having twelve figures in each, with English 
names. These, though rude, would have been highly 
valuable, had they, in every instance, been drawn from 
native specimens ; but being often copied from fo- 
reign books, whose figures, in several instances, were 
misapplied, even by Ray himself, the engravings of 
Petiver sometimes serve only to perpetuate error. 
They are however often cited with advantage when 
original, and will be found, in the sequel of this work, 
to throw light upon many a difficult question. 

The Flora Angliai,hy Mr. William Hudson, F.R.S., 



XIV P R E F A C E. 

an apothecary in Panton-street, Haymarket, pub- 
lished in 1762, marks the establishment of Linneean 
principles of Botany in England, and their applica- 
tion to practical use. With this book in his hand, 
any one conversant with the Latin language, and 
with the first rudiments of systematic knowledge, 
might reduce a wild plant to its class, order, genus 
and species. By turning to the books indicated un- 
der each species, he would become acquainted with 
every thing relating to its characters, history, or 
properties, and might confirm his own determination 
of the plants, by the figures and descriptions of for- 
mer writers. This is the use of a systematic arrange- 
ment, and therefore the more clear and easy it is the 
better. Hudson's work became extremely popular, 
and rose in process of time to near twenty times its 
original price. A second edition appeared in 1778, 
in two volumes, with many additions, and various al- 
terations, especially among the Grasses, Mr. Hudson 
having pursued a train of experiments upon the dif- 
ferent species or varieties of this family by cultiva- 
tion. But his alterations are certainly not all for the 
better. His synonyms are often faulty, particularly 
those of foreign authors, from a practice, not thought 
reprehensible in his time, of transcribing them from 
other books, without examination. This is proved 
by various errors in the names or pages cited ; and 
Linnaeus, in whom Hudson and others have chiefly 
confided, is more faulty in such matters than most 
writers ; for he often left the transcription of his 
synonyms to his pupils, after having written his own 
names in the margins of the books to be quoted. 
The Rev. Mr. Lightfoot's Flora Scot/ca, in two 



P RE F A C Ei XV 

volumes, written in English, with a few indifferent 
plates, was published the year before the second edi- 
tion of the Floi^a Anglica, and is a useful companion 
to that work. But if Hudson be censurable for 
blindly copying synonyms, what shall we say of 
Lightfoot? He translated entire descriptions from 
foreign writers, without any indication of the sources 
from whence they were borrowed, and many of them 
are now known to belong to different plants from 
ours, so that the student is led into a labyrinth of 
error, from which he has no means of extricating 
himself, nor indeed of knowing when he is in the 
right path. 

The first edition of Hudson having become so very 
scarce, a Latin Flora AiigUca, on a more compen- 
dious plan, was begun in 1774, by the present Sir 
Thomas Gery CuUum, Bart. But this work was sup- 
pressed on the appearance of the second edition, and 
goes no further than the genus Dauciis, a few copies 
only having been distributed gratuitously by the 
highly estimable author amongst his friends. 

An English work translated from the full generic, 
and essential specific, characters of Linnaeus, as far 
as regards British plants, exclusive of Grasses, Trees, 
and all the Cryptogamia, except Ferns, was published 
at Kendal in 1775, by Mr. James Jenkinson. This 
might serve to initiate young beginners, ignorant of 
Latin, into the Linnsean mode of description. 

A far more complete and valuable work, in our 
native tongue, appeared in 1786, from the pen of 
the late William Withering, M.D., an eminent phy- 
sician at Birmingham, under the title of " A Botani- 
cal Arrangement of all the Vegetables naturally 



XVI PREFACE. 

growing in Great Britain." Of this a second edition, 
greatly improved, came forth in 1787, consisting, 
like the former, of two volumes. This edition is ren- 
dered peculiarly valuable by " a new set of references 
to figures," by Dr. Jonathan Stokes ; who performed, 
with great judgment and accuracy, the laborious 
task of examining almost every figure, throughout 
the whole botanical library, which was referrible to 
any British plant, and of disposing citations of the 
whole in order, according to their comparative ex- 
cellence. A third edition of Dr. Withering's work, 
greatly enlarged in its plan and execution, making 
four volumes, appeared in 1796. In this the classes 
with separated flowers, and the Gynandria, are, ac- 
cording to the scheme of Thunberg and others, abo- 
lished ; an alteration which it would not become me 
to reject without giving my reasons, and these may 
be found in the Introduction to Botany, which the 
reader will of course peruse before he applies the 
present work to practical use. This edition of Wither- 
ing, the last which its worthy author completed, is 
what I have always used, and the only one quoted 
in the ensuing pages. Two more editions with which 
I am not conversant, have been given to the world 
since his death. 

The work of Dr. Withering was the only book, at 
the time of its publication, which could effectually 
serve a mere English reader, in the present advanced 
state of botanical knowledge, for the determination 
of British Plants. Its language is liable to little 
exception. The references to figures have, in the 
tliird edition, been revised and corrected, but not I 
believe by their original author Dr. Stokes. Nume- 



PREFACE. XVll 



rous places of growth, of the less common plants, 
have been added, and several new species intro- 
duced. I know but of one essential fault in the 
original plan of this work, and that is much lessened 
in the third edition, the compilation of descriptions 
from foreign authors, which do not always belong 
to our plants. Nevertheless, as Dr. Withering in- 
variably mentions the sources from whence he has 
borrowed, no reader can necessarily be misled. 

An English book, to the language of which I have 
always been partial, is the " Outlines of the Natural 
History of Great Britain and Ireland, by John Berk- 
enbout, M.D.," published in 1770, in three volumes, 
the second comprehending the Vegetable Kingdom. 
It is without synonyms, but the short characters are 
clear and expressive. This work, however, is super- 
seded by Withering s. A second edition, under the 
title of a Synopsis, in two volumes, appeared in 1789. 

It is scarcely necessary to mention Stephen Rob- 
son's British Flora, printed at York in 1777, with three 
plates ; the Enchiridion Botanicwn, a concise Latin 
work of a similar aim, published by Arthur Brough- 
ton, M.D., at London in 1782; or the " Plates of 
the Indigenous Plants of Great Britain," chiefly 
outlines and many of them diminished, given to the 
publick, at a very cheap rate, by Mr. John Walcot of 
Bath in 1778. The last publication was discon- 
tinued after tab. 168, and the two former have never 
been very popular. 

A great work, illustrative of British plants, but, 
as Mr. Dryander has observed, " more splendid than 
useful," in twelve quarto volumes, with numerous

coloured plates, was printed, I know not precisely 
at what period, by John Earl of Bute, a nobleman 
greatly devoted to botanical studies, some of whose 
letters to the late Mr. Peter Collinson may be seen 
in the " Linnaean Correspondence" above mentioned, 
vol, i. 26 â€” 36. His Lordship's book being intended 
for the use of his particular friends only, chiefly 
ladies, no more than twelve copies were printed, and 
it therefore can hardly be thought a just subject of 
criticism. Apelles remarked that an ordinary artist 
could more readily paint Helen rich than handsome ; 
so it is easier to make a rare book than a good one. 

Various partial, or local, Floras have at different 
times appeared in Britain, from the first promulga- 
tion of the Linnaean system to the present day. 
These it is not necessary to particularize here. 
They will be occasionally referred to in the body of 
the work, and their titles are given in the List of 
Authors at the end of this Preface. 

One great national work however, by its title of 
Flora Londinensis limited to the neighbourhood of 
the metropolis, must nevertheless here be noticed; 
for though not yet completed, it has admitted the 
vegetable productions of several remote parts of 
Britain. Its author, the late Mr. William Curtis, 
has been extensively known by his popular and 
very useful Botanical Magazine. But the Floi^a 
Londineiisis, a work of great practical observation 
and experience, ranks, as I have elsewhere ob- 
served*, " independent of its excellent figures, next

to Ray's Si/nopais, in original merit and authority 
upon English plants." It is now continued, with 
great ability, by Professor Hooker of Glasgow. 

In the year 1790 the late Mr. James Sowerby, an 
eminent botanical draugflitsman and a faithful ob- 
server of nature, requested my assistance in publish- 
ing coloured figures of British plants. I readily 
undertook the letter-press of this work, and it came 
out in monthly numbers, under the title of English 
Botany. My name at first did not appear; but 
finding: the book a fit vehicle for original informa- 
tion and criticism, I publickly acknowledged it by a 
preface to the fourth volume in 1795, and the title- 
page of every succeeding volume declares its real 
author. This publication, from which the Fungi 
are excluded, has now extended to 36 volumes, and 
has been closed, for the present, by general indexes 
to the whole. It approaches nearer to a complete 
set of figures of the native plants, than ever appeared 
in this or any country. The plates amount to 2592, 
and it is but just to the memory of the excellent and 
lamented artist, to say, that they are, on the whole, 
the most expressive and accurate of their kind. In 
the account of each species, besides corrected cha- 
racters, synonyms and descriptions, I have frequently 
introduced whatever might recommend the study of 
plants, diffuse a charm over the more dry and techni- 
cal parts of the subject, improve our scientific lan- 
guage, or direct the contemplative mind to more 
important and exalted views of its Creator's works. 
The English Botany has had an extensive sale, and 
I trust it has very widely promoted a love ofplants, 
and a taste for correct and scientific botany^ Some-

times I have doubted whether these ends have been 
so fully ansvf^ered as its partial author might expect ; 
and whether the great facility with which a trivial and 
superficial knowledge of plants is now gained, by 
turning over books of coloured figures, may not be 
injurious to true science. The flippancy with which 
every body quotes " Sowerby," whom they know 
merely as the delineator of these plates, without ad- 
verting to the information of the work, or the name of 
its author, leads me to the mortifying conclusion, that 
all I have done is of little avail, except to the pene- 
trating eyes of the scientific few, who stand less in 
need of such assistance. But with their approbation 
I am conscious I oug^ht to be content. 

The acquisition of the Linnaean herbarium soon 
discovered to the botanists of England that many of 
our native plants had hitherto been mistaken, and 
that the nomenclature of our whole Flora stood in 
need of revision. Hence I was led to undertake a 
Latin Flora Britminica, of which two volumes were 
published in 1800, and a third in 1804. This last 
concludes with the Miisci, the rest of the crypto- 
gamic orders remaining as yet unfinished. The 
chief merit to which this work aspires is originality. 
The author has examined every thing for himself, 
copying nothing without investigation. Every ge- 
neric and specific character has been scrutinized, 
and, where necessary, corrected ; and the descrip- 
tions are all made from wild British specimens. 
Any borrowed fact or information is invariably ac- 
knowledged. The Flora Britannica has been fa- 
vourably received, both at horn and abroad. It 
was reprinted, word for word, by Dr. Romer at 



PREFACE. XXl 

Zurich, and a great German critic has been pleased 
to reckon it inferior only to the Flora Germanka of 
Schrader. The author cannot but wish so liioh a 
compliment were better deserved. The Compen- 
dium Florae. BritanniccE is an epitome of this work, 
containing the specific characters entire, with a few 
additional remarks. This has been reprinted, and 
accommodated to the German Flora, by Professor 
Hoffmann, at Gottingen ; and the late Mr. Galpine 
published an English translation, at Salisbury, in 
1806. 

Dr. Hull of Manchester has furnished the Eng-lish 
student with a British Flora in his native language, 
of which there are two editions. 

Notwithstanding all these publications upon Bri- 
tish Plants, the want of a more complete and au- 
thentic work in English, unexceptionable in phra- 
seology, has been generally felt and acknowledged ; 
insomuch that various applications have, from time 
to time, been made to me, for permission to translate 
the Flora Britamiica, or to compile an English 
work from that and the English Botany ; for it has 
been observed by some persons that " a British Flora 
can in future be no more than a compilation." Such 
projects, and such views of the subject, made me 
sensible of the necessity of my undertaking an 
Efigiish Flora ; and since this intention has been 
announced, the calls for its accomplishment have 
multiplied, so that I find myself under an obligation 
to make, at least, a beginning, by publishing two vo- 
lumes in the first place, and proceeding immediately 
with the remainder. 

Having now, for more than thirty years, had the 



XXU PREFACE., 

botany of my native country perpetually under con- 
sideration in the progress of the English Botany and 
Floi-a Britannica; and this same subject having en- 
gaged the attention of numerous coadjutors, espe- 
cially among those members of the Linneean Society 
who have contributed to enrich its Transactions ; I 
am avi^are of so great a progress in our general stock 
of knovrledge, that a Flora of Britain, far from being 
necessarily a compilation, or a translation, must now 
be a new and original work. The books just men- 
tioned may, indeed, form the basis of such an un- 
dertaking ; but the science of Botany, through their 
means, has been progressive in an eminent degree, for 
twenty years past, and the accession of new-disco- 
vered species will be found no less considerable in 
that space of time, than the elucidation of those pre- 
viously known. Two natural orders of plants in parti- 
cular occur, in the present volumes, under entirely 
new points of view ; the Linnsean CalamaricE, chiefly 
comprehended in the Trlandr'ia Monogynia, and the 
Unibellat(Â£ in Pentandria Digyjiia. The genera of 
the former had never been well defined, till Mr. 
Brown, in his Prodromus of the Flora of New Hol- 
land, undertook this difficult task. His labours have 
generally been my guide, and I have ventured to dif- 
fer from this great botanist chiefly in one particular. 
He admits, as an essential generic distinction, the 
absence or presence of certain bristles under the 
seed in the CalamaricE. The observation of nature, 
in several instances, but especially in Scirpus cari- 
cinus and rufus, pp. 58, 59, has taught me, beyond 
a doubt, that such bristles ought to have no place 
in the generic characters, though they here distin- 



PREFACE. XXlll 



giiish two very difficult species. I have also been 
oblig-ed to correct a few mistakes of my learned 
friend Dr. Sclirader, and of other distinguished 
writers, concerning these plants, and their near 
allies the Grasses ; all which I submit, with due 
deference, to the reconsideration of the parties con- 
cerned. In the order of UinbellatcE considerable 
indulgence may be requisite, as my performance is 
almost entirely novel. No reason has been given 
for taking the inflorescence and bracteas into consi- 
deration, for defining the genera of this tribe, ex- 
cept the supposed necessity of such a measure. Se- 
veral botanists have blamed Linnaeus for this dere- 
liction of his own principles, and have run into a 
contrary error, by fixing on the seeds alone for ge- 
neric characters. The able Professor Sprengel has 
had recourse to the seeds, but he still adverts to 
the bracteas. Professor Hoffmann has adhered to 
the old principles, with many minute details. By 
a full investigation of all the organs of fructifica- 
tion, and by distinguishing the tumid bases of the 
styles from the floral receptacle, things hitherto 
confounded, I have characterized the Umbelliferous 
plants like the rest, by the parts of the flotver and 
fruit alone. In doing this I have kept the exotic 
species in view, of which the Linnaean collection, 
and those of many botanists of Switzerland, with 
the Greek herbarium of my lamented friend Pro- 
fessor Sibthorp, have furnished me with almost all 
that are known.^ The principles I have adopted 
prove amply sufficient, being no other than those by 
which Linnseus was on the whole so successful, 
though he deserted them in the arrangement of the 



XXIV PREFACE. 

tribe in question. But what aft'ords me most satis- 
faction is, that I am thus enabled to keep entire al- 
most all his own genera. He had in reality founded 
them by that penetrating insight into natural genera, 
for which he was so eminent ; but he was always 
labouring, according to his ideas derived from the 
umbels, and involiicrums as he called the bracteas, to 
make " the genus give a character," and this labour 
was often in vain. Parts that vary in the same 
individual species, and difTer in those most closely 
related, can obviously never prove a safe foundation 
for generic distinctions. Yet prepossession often 
stands in the way of truth. It appears from the 
letters of Cusson, who devoted all his time to the 
study of this tribe, that he just began, towards the 
end of his labours, to think the fioral receptacle, 
meaning principally the bases of the styles, had not 
been sufficiently attended to ; but he had not reso- 
lution to begin his task anew. If what I have done 
should excite the attention of competent judges, I 
hope succeeding botanists will improve upon this 
attempt ; for all who have looked at Umbelliferous 
plants, must be aware of the necessity of their better 
definition. When studied upon fixed principles, 
they will be found well worthy of attention, and not 

ss instructive or curious than more gaudy flowers. 

I must now particularly explain what I have had 
in view in the general plan and execution of the 
following work. 

The reader is requested to consider that the first 
object of this English Flora is botanical discrimina- 
tion ; by which I mean, not only the furnishing 
English readers with means for the easy and accu- 



)> n E P A C E. XXV 

rate determination of our species of native plants, 
but also to inculcate and exemplify principles ca- 
pable of more extensive application. I wish to lead 
young botanists to the study of genera and species, 
with their true grounds of distinction and definition. 
Those who may take the trouble accurately to follow 
me, will find I have given my whole attention to 
these objects. I have also, for the first time in a 
general British Flora, introduced the Natural Orders 
of our plants, and have under each genus subjoined 
a compendious view of its natural habit, characters 
and qualities, after the manner first attempted by 
Gouan, and carried to perfection in the Sy sterna of 
DeCandolle, a prodigy of knowledge and labour, 
and the greatest work of practical Botany that this 
age, or perhaps any other, has produced. But I 
have offered no natural arrangement of the British 
plants. A Flora can afford but a broken and partial 
view of a Natural System, nor can such a system 
answer the first purpose of a Flora, which is to en- 
able unpractised students to investigate and deter- 
mine unknown plants. Those English botanists 
who wish to become acquainted with the dependence 
of the natural orders on each other, as exemplified 
in the system of Jussieu, will find all they can de- 
sire in my Grammar of Botany, chiefly designed 
for that purpose. The Artificial System of Linnaeus, 
equally applicable to any Flora or catalogue of 
plants, is used in the present work ; that any bo- 
tanist, by reducing a plant to its class and order, 
according to the perspicuous and easy rules of that 
system, may next compare it with the short essential 
characters of the genera, at the head of each class. 



XXVI PREFACE. 

which genera are there artificially disposed accord- 
ing to those characters. Having determined the 
genus, he will then find it, amongst its allies, duly 
numbered, in the body of the work, where its full 
characters, with all needful observations, and re- 
ferences to figures of the fructification, are given ; 
the natural order, according to Linnaeus, Jussieu, 
or others, being indicated. For the history of the 
natural order, and a view of the other genera be- 
longing to it, the student may then turn to the Gram- 
mar. Having become acquainted with what relates 
to the genus of his plant, he will next compare his 
specimen with all the specific characters under that 
genus, till he ascertains its species, and confirms his 
determination of its name by reading the particular 
description, and consulting as many of the synonym^s, 
or authors quoted, as he may have within his reach ; 
thus finally becoming acquainted with all that is re- 
corded concerning the plant he has gathered. 

With respect to the last mode of inquiry, I would 
recommend a young botanist to be very sparing, 
till he has settled his mind, respecting the species 
before him, by its characters alone. Those who 
are employed in instructing others, will find an ad- 
vantage in keeping the attention of their pupils to 
characters and definitions. By this their powers of 
observation and discrimination will be strengthened. 
They will know why they apply such a name to 
each particular plant, and I know by experience 
that species thus investigated are never forgotten. 
The memory of the student may further be assisted 
by drying and preserving competent specimens, not 
mutilated fragments, of all his plants; which will 



P R E r A C E. XXVll 

gradually form a valuable memorial of his labours, 
and a storehouse of pleasing recollections and asso- 
ciations. I have long ago observed, that " a plant 
gathered in a celebrated or delightful spot, is, like 
the hair of a friend, more dear to memory than even 
a portrait ; because it excites the imagination, v^^ith- 
out presuming to fill it ;" nor do I find such senti- 
ments at all impaired by advancing age. 

In the language of the present vi^ork, freed from 
all exceptionable allusions, I have chiefly aimed at 
writing common sense in plain English. Hard 
words have never taught wisdom, nor does truth 
require them. The few unavoidable technical ex- 
pressions must be familiar to those who have read 
any introductory book, especially the Introduction 
to Botany and Grammar, or may be readily under- 
stood by a reference to such publications. In doubtful 
cases I have taken Johnson's Dictionary for autho- 
rity ; but wherever a pure English word could be 
found, I have preferred it, as well as English termi- 
nations and construction, Happy should I be to 
lend any assistance to the improvement and esta- 
blishment of our botanical language, or to remove 
from it the charges of inelegance and obscurity. 
Late writers have, from diflfidence or inattention, not 
much furthered this object. I hope following ones 
will not overlook it, but concur with me where they 
find me in the right, and improve upon me where 
they see occasion ; altering nothing for the sake of 
alteration, either in characters or language ; such 
emendations, however easy, being extremely incon- 
v^enient. It is scarcely necessary to remark that 
smooth, as opposed to all hairiness and roughness, 



XXVlll P R E FA C E. 

is preferable to glabrous^ though the latter is near- 
er the Latin ; while eveii expresses a freedom from 
all inequality. The former answers exactly to the 
Latin glaber, the latter to IcEvis. Heartshaped is full 
as intelligible as cordate ; furrowed is surely pre- 
ferable to silicate, and triangular to triquetrous. 
When, as in the last instance, a purely Latin word 
is become familiar English, it is certainly not the 
worse on that account. Uniform, universal, and 
many others, are now completely naturalized, and 
may justify unilateral as a translation, now first at- 
tempted, of secundus ; and Avhich is at any rate 
better than secund. The Latin has furnished us 
with numerous words, in common use, beginning 
with ob ; and therefore obovate may be admitted, as 
more commodious than inversely ovate, and by this 
time equally intelligible. Still I prefer the English 
construction of ovate-lanceolate to the half Latin 
ovato-lanceolate. According to these examples, the 
reader will judge of the rest. He will find in my 
-introductory publications explanations of every use- 
ful or necessary term, perhaps of many more ; though 
in general those which pedantry and affectation have 
contrived, without necessity, are purposely omitted 
in those works, and I hope never used in the present 
volumes. 

The synonyms, or references to authors, given 
in the Flora Britannica, have here received consi- 
derable augmentation, as well as correction. Every 
one has been carefully revised ; and where the same 
specific names as mine are used, it has been thought 
best not to encumber these pages with citations of 
every provincial or local Flora throughout ; though 



PREFACE. XXIX 

where our nomenclature differs, such difference is 
generally marked. Neither have I been desirous of 
assembling together every particular place of growth 
of the less common species. I have noted where 
the rarer ones are to be found, but principally when 
I have verified the fact by my own examination, or 
by seeing specimens. Common report is little to be 
trusted ; and the English student, if desirous to 
know all that has been recorded upon this subject, 
may amply satisfy his curiosity with the Botanist's 
Guide of Turner and Dillwyn, a work whose sole 
object is to assist the travelling botanist in his in- 
quiries. Many readers may think a regular indica- 
tion of the Scottish plants desirable ; and therefore, 
though Lightfoof s jP/orÂ« Scotica is not quoted through- 
out, in my Latin work, I have here cited that of my 
friend Professor Hooker completely. The valuable 
Midland Flora of Mr. Purton, an assiduous and 
faithful observer, will be found worthy of frequent 
consultation. The general uniformity of our no- 
menclature and arrangement will render this work 
easy of access to the readers of mine, and in several 
places I have pointed out my obligations to its worthy 
author. 

The room gained by omitting superfluous refe- 
rences has allowed of more copious citations of the old 
writers and their expressive cuts, as well as of many 
valuable modern synonyms. Old books have been 
too much neglected by new writers, though a student 
may derive great pleasure, and considerable infor- 
mation, by an introduction to them- I have consi- 
dered it as an imperative duty to examine every 
synonym herein adopted, marking as quotations, be-

t 

tween inverted commas, the few which I could not 
consult. I cannot too often insist on the mischief 
of copying synonyms from other books. The value 
of synonyms consists entirely in their collector being 
answerable for their exactness ; by which he enriches 
his own work with the accumulated treasures of the 
botanical library, as far as his readers think proper 
to follow up the pursuit. But if he blindly tran- 
scribes them, such surreptitious references are sure 
to be soon discovered, by the frequent errors of the 
press, respecting pages or figures, which occur in 
most books. At a single discovery of this kind, all 
our respect and confidence vanish ; for we know not 
that every thing else of the same nature is not equally 
fallacious ; and an author who has appeared very 
learned and deeply read, proves a copyist of the very 
lowest rank, decked out with imposing but borrowed 
feathers. M. DeCandolle, that great practical as 
well as learned botanist, has not only examined cri- 
tically his immense store of synonyms, but has sub- 
joined a mark of admiration, whenever he has seen 
the original specimen of any author. He disposes 
his references chronologically, which, in a general 
system, has many advantages. I have followed no 
precise method in the arrangement of mine, except 
that the Linnsean and other systematic ones stand 
first, as agreeing mostly with the names I have 
adopted ; and those which are most certain or impor- 
tant generally take the lead. I have taken great 
pains, from original authorities, to determine all 
those of Haller. The older writers are ranged ac- 
cording to the goodness of their figures, the value 
or certainty of their information, or perhaps accord- 



PREFACE. XXXI 

ing to the order in which I am in the habit of con- 
sulting them, which has arisen from long practice, 
those which I have found most useful naturally of- 
fering themselves first to my attention. By their be- 
ing generally in the same order, the reader will know 
where to look for each. Ray's Sijnopsis is necessarily 
in an English Flora, regularly quoted throughout; 
as likewise is much of Gerarde's Herbal by John- 
son ; and the noble wooden cuts of Matthiolus, pub- 
lished by Valgrisius at Venice. But the bulk of the 
old herbalists, whether Eng^lish or foreio;n, have been 
used merely for occasional reference, when they 
seemed likely to be serviceable, or when their figures 
appeared peculiarly good. 

In the indexes I have spared neither time nor la- 
bour. An author may fail in judgment or know- 
ledge, and for this fallibility he is entitled to indul- 
gence ; but an index requires nothing more than 
such a degree of care and attention as his readers 
have a right, on their part, to expect from him. 

If those who take my various publications for their 
botanical guides, have half the pleasure in using 
these books, that I have had in composing them, I 
need scarcely wish them more. Innocent amuse- 
ment, inducing a change of ideas, is wholesome for 
the mind, like air and exercise for the body. On 
this ground alone Botany may well be recommended ; 
nor shall I repeat here those higher views of its im- 
portance as a science, which may be found in the 
preface to my Introduction, or in my pamphlets on 
the subject of the Cambridge Botanical Professor- 
ship. On those occasions it was necessary to ex- 
plain, to the uninformed, the aims and pretensions 



XXXll PREFACE. 

of the science about to be taught ; but in the present 
instance I must presume that those who look to my 
book for information, need no persuasion to the pur- 
suit itself, nor any recommendation of Botany, or of 
the study of Nature. Neither am I disposed to con- 
tend here for the superiority of these pursuits over 
others. A man who looks no further than the nar- 
row bounds of his own profession or science, is some- 
times inclined to depreciate those of other people, 
especially if any worldly advantage be concerned. 
Some studies seem to contract the mind ; but such 
is not the character of natural science, which en- 
larges the understanding by a perpetual display of 
the power and wisdom of God, and encourages our 
best hopes by sure testimonies of his goodness. He 
who feeds the sparrows, and clothes the golden lily 
of the fields in a splendour beyond that of Solomon 
himself, invites us, his rational creatures, to confide 
in his promises of Eternal Life. The simplest blade 
of grass, and the grain of corn to which " he gives its 
own body," are suflficient to convince us that our 
trust cannot be in vain. Let those who hope to in- 
herit these promises, and those who love science for 
its own sake, cherish the same benevolent disposi- 
tions. Envy and rivalship in one case are no less 
censurable, than bigotry and uncharitableness in the 
other. The former are as incompatible with the 
love of Nature, as the latter with the love of God ; 
and they altogether unfit us for the enjoyment of 
happiness here or hereafter.

Style terminal, curved outwards, cylindricaL Stigm. 2, 
thread-shaped, acute, curved. Drupa cylindrical, pointed, 
somewhat juicy. Nut 1, oval, striated. Kernel of the 
same shape, with 2 flattish, partially combined, cotyledons. 
Embryo central, cylindrical, curved. Radicle inferior, 
(that is, opposite to the scar of the seed). See Prof. 
Hooker's dissections in Fl. Lond. new series t. 33. 

The two cotyledons seem to me to confirm the propriety of 
removing this genus from the Aroidece ; for this plant is 
surely as truly dicotyledonous as Cyamus. See Gaertner 
t. 19, Nelumbo. 

Root creeping. Herb smooth, long and slender, floating 
under water. Stein roundish, branched, leafy; decumbent 
at the base, with tufts of fibrous radicles from each knot 
or joint. Leaves alternate, linear, flat, very long; their 
sheaths containing the spadLr, and at length torn longi- 
tudinally, to let out the seeds. 

Professor Hooker, following Schreber and Willdenow, re- 
moves this genus to Monoecia, because he observes the 
numberof r/??^^'; -5 and pistils not always to correspond; the 
former being sometimes about twice the most numerous. 
This may arise from occasional suppression of some pistils, 
often incident to plants of a simple structure, and indeed 
to all plants when the source of nourishment is weakened. 
I have found these two organs regularly corresponding 
in number, and placed respectively right and left alter- 
nately, as in Engl. Bot., which is a strong indication of 
each anther and pistil making naturally one jlo^wer, and 
for this reason 1 persist in my original opinion, which 
has been adopted by Vahl.

Aquatic herbs, smooth or prickly, with a cylindrical, sub-

naked, the anther and pistil mostly together, rarely on 
separate plants ; so that the genus is not monoecious, 
though, in one or two instances, occasionally dioecious. 
The real nature of the fructification, or mode of impreg- 
nation, is very obscure.

Root fixed in the mud. Herb reaching near the surface, but always 
completely immersed. Main branches alternate ; subordinate 
ones whorled, 6 or 8 in a whorl, tapev-pointed, an inch long, or 
more, jointed internally with transverse partitions, and, towards 
the top of the stem, beset, on their upper side, with rows of 
erect, minute, awl-shaped bracteas, 4 together, in whose centre 
stands the pale, sessile, ovate, bluntly 5-toothed ger7n&i ; and 
close to it, but at the outside of the bracteas, the sessile, pale 
reddish, slimy anther. Whole plant nauseously fetid, usually 
incrusted with earth, if any happens to be chemically dissolved 
in the water.

Differs from the last chiefly in its prickly stem, and more numerous 
bracteas, which form whorls round the branches. It is often, in

Firmer, and rather stouter, than CJlexilis, but much more slender 
than the last, and more divaricated tlian either. The axillary 
branches, which bear fructification, and rather numerously sur- 
round the main stem, within the long slender whorled branches, 
being themselves whorled and subdivided, cause the bushy or 
proliferous aspect, which at first sight marks this species. Three 
or four small, unequal, cylindrical bracteas accompany each 
flower, as in C. vulgaris and liispida. The anther is often stalked^ 
especially, as it seems, when the plant is occasionally dioecious.

Much smaller, as well as more delicate and compound, than any 
of the foregoing ; when dry, glittering and glassy, almost colour- 
less. Whorled branches very rarely simple ; mostly forked or 
subdivided repeatedly, bearing the^owers in their forks. Anth. 
and gervi. usually together, without bracteas. Tliis species and 
C.Jlexilis first taught me to consider Chara as having no real 
leaves ; what preceding writers have termed so, being in no re- 
spect different from the branches, in structure or economy, as 
they often bear the flowers. 

In Ray's Historia, v. 3. 104, the present species is confounded with 
the naked state of C. vulgaris ; and Dillenius, in his edition of 
the Synopsis, has fallen into the same error.

The very accurate Dr. Wahlenberg's remarks, and specimens from 
my late worthy correspondent Mr. Bruce, prove the distinctness 
of this species. The leaves are more membranous and much 
more minutely cellular, of a rich, deep, permanent green ; the 
uppermost, according to Loesel, crowded and floating, but all 
linear. Fl. according to Linn., united, not separated. Outer 
edges of the seeds very thin and membranous. Mr. Bruce's plant 
grew a foot belov*^ the surface.

Leaves stalked, of 5 or 6 pair, with an odd one, of ovate-lan- 
ceolate, acute, nearly sessile, opposite leaflets, whose main rib 
is fringed beneath; their common stalk channelled and bordered. 
Panicles from lateral buds, below the leaf-buds, drooping, many- 
flowered. Flowers small, brown, consisting only of a pistil, with 
(generally) one short stamen at each side. Very rarely there 
are flowers with stamens only. Capsules with a fiat leaf-like 
termination, an inch long, and generally of 2 cells, with an ob-

the leaves are mostly fringed. â€” The variety /3 is as tall as the 
lutetiana ; its pubescence, though often copious, very minute j 
but the shining leaves, and their sharp serratures, as well as the 
structure and hue of the Jlowers^ accord best with C. alpina.

Larger and rather more hairy, especially about the calyx, than the 
preceding, having usually 1 or 2 lateral spikes, or rudiments of 
them. The lower leaves are nearly ovate, being abrupt at the 
base, towards the footstalks. All the leaves are of a broader, 
rather elliptical, figure; their serratures stronger, more copious 
and general, and their hue a more grassy green. These two 
species ai*e certainly very near akin, but Professor Schrader, one

doubt or "^supposition," told me he found this plant on Ben 
Lawers. I trust no further confirmation is requisite to establish 
it as a native. 

Perennial. July. 

Root strong and woody. Stems branched, entangled and shrubby 
at their base; the flowering branches erect, about 6 inches high, 
round, slightly downy, leafy, mostly simple. Leaves distantly 
notched or serrated, rather pale, downy at their edges and veins ; 
sometimes quite entire. C'/MS/er usually solitary, minutely downy.

rather spiked than corymbose. Flmvers pale pink, or flesh- 
coloured, veined, on partial stalks which are much lengthened, 
and the calyx enlarged, after flowering. Caps, rather elliptical 
and abrupt, longer than the calyx, soon splitting into 4 acute 
valves. Seeds flattish, smooth. The plant is by no means hairy, 
but rather downy, as is very exactly expressed in Engl. Bot.

Perennial. July. 

Of more humble and spreading growth than the last. Leaves 
smaller, serrated about their middle, dull green. Flowers from 
3 to 6 only, in each corymbose, not spiked, cluster ; their stalks 
finely downy, twice or thrice as long as the bracteas. Cor. large, 
beautiful, of a fine blue, pink at the mouth. Caps, much like 
the last.

Stems prostrate, creeping, 6 â€” 18 inches long, round. Whole 
plant more or less rough with spreading, short, jointed hairs. 
Leaves blunt or pointed, single-ribbed, on short stalks, rather 
rigid. Clusters pointed, much longer than the leaves, erect. Cal. 
elliptical, narrow, nearly equal, hairy. Cor. light blue, with dark 
streaks. Stigma always capitate. Caps, inversely heart-shaped, 
rather abrupt, veiny. Seeds pale, smooth, disk-like. 

/3 has nearly smooth stems, leaves and calyx, with hairy Jlower- 
stalks, but appears to be a mere variety. The stigma is capitate. 

The real F. AUionii, as I have often in vain represented, is a 
totally distinct exotic species, with perfectly smooth, thick, 
rigid leaves ; blunt, dense, long-stalked clusters, of nearly ses- 
sile, deep-blue flowers, characterized essentially by a simple, 
abrupt, not capitate, stigma, 

V. officinalis is recommended as a sort of medicinal tea, and Simon 
Paulli, an old Danish botanist, contended it was the identical 
tea of China. The flavour is astringent and bitter, by no means 
agreeable j perhaps most resembling common black tea.

Columna first described, and admirably figured, this species ; the

Kent ; and Curtis has elucidated it beyond all future doubt. 
A foolish story is told of its changing to V. Chamcedrys, which 
out of regard to a most excellent botanist, whose own specimens 
are before me, ought not to have appeared in print. No two 
species can be more distinct. The universal hairiness of the 
stem ; stalked, thinner, and more shining, lectves ; and smaller 
paler^^oioers, are sufficient marks ; but the compressed, dilated 
capsules, formed as it were of two orbicular cells, and thrice as 
large as the foregoing, are decisive.

Most like V. arvensis in habit and colour, but much smaller. The 
leaves are deeply divided, in a pinnatifid manner, with a central

In a starved state few or none of the leaves are divided, and it 
becomes F. Bellardi. 

V. succulenta is the identical verna in its proper state. The stem 
is simple or branched, from 1 to 4 inches high ; unequally 
downy, as in F. arvensis. Fl, small, light blue, with darker

According to Richard, the embryo is monocotyledonous 
throughout this whole Order ; and Mr. Brown has found 
it so in Utricularia, but in Pinguicula he observed 2 
very certain cotyledons. Here therefore is an exception 
to one of those distinctions, generally presumed most ab- 
solute ; nor is it a solitary instance. 

Although the difference between a regular and an irregular 
jlower is by no means sufficient, in general, to constitute 
a separate Natural Order, (see Liuridce in Penlandria Mo- 
nogynia) ; yet in the present case that difference is con- 
firmed by so many additional circumstances, that few 
Orders can be better defined, or more obvious, than that 
of the Lentibidaritr.2

The crow^n of the root sends out 5 or 6, simple or alternately 
branched, leafy shoots, about a foot long. Leaves alternate, 
triply pinnatifid, almost capillaiy, bearing numerous crested 
bladders, which float the plant at the flowering season, by means 
of air formed within them. This air, according to Mr. Hayne, 
gives place subsequently to water, and the plant sinks, to ripen 
its seed at the bottom. Fl. 6 or 8, large, yellow, with an

The genus Mariscus of Haller is only the LinuEean Schcenus under 
another name. Mariscus of Vahl is a different genus, established 
by him, and retained by Mr. Brown, who first determined Schce- 
nus Cladium of Solander, Swartz and Vahl to be the same species 
as our Cladium Mariscus. Schrader is of a different opinion, 
and amongst other differences, which may be accounted for, 
asserts that the fruit is surrounded by bristles. Swartz says 
there are bristles at the sides of tlie inner glume, which sur- 
rounds the germen ; and Dr. Browne before him had recorded 
the existence of 2 such, arising from the back of the corolla, 
towards its base. All the difficulty is removed by an examina- 
tion in the Linnagan herbarium, of Dr. Browne's own Jamaica 
specimen, which, being in an early state of flowering, and each 
spike more or less perfectly 2 -flowered, the second or later^ower 
is not opened ; and its stigma, not yet put forth, constitutes 
these supposed bristles. I find the same thing in the English 
Cladium Mariscus, and no doubt remains of their being one 
Â« species. Whether the second ^ower, or any rudiment of it, be 
always present or not, there is only one drupa perfected in each 
spike of the English plant, with something like an abortive flower 
now and then attached to it at one side. My Jamaica specimen 
has no fruit formed ; but by Dr. Browne's description it ap- 
pears that one flower only proves perfect, or fertile.

Fedia, as derived from Fedus, an ancient word, synonymous with 
Hadus, a kid, is not unsuitable to this genus. J'alerianella,

[This natural order, for which I prefer the original name of 
Calamaria, has received great illustration by Mr. Brown's 
discoveries in New Holland ; and from his Prodromus 
the following characters, in addition to Jussieu's, given 

VOL. I. E

in the Grammar, are principally taken. My calyx, con- 
sisting of a single scale or glume to eachjlower, and often 
accompanied by many smaller empty ones in each spike, 
is the palea (chaff or scale) of Mr. Brown. The Perianth, 
or Calyx, of this author, is either wanting, or consists of 
rough bristles, various in number, or more rarely is mem- 
branous, as in the genus Carex, consisting in that instance 
of 1 valve ; in others of 3. But my objection to this view 
of the subject is, that these bristles, or membranous parts, 
are situated between the stamens and germeii, and cannot 
therefore be either calyx or corolla, but are rather an 
appendage to the germen and seed, which latter they ac- 
company to the last. 

The stamens are " of a definite number, generally 3, some- 
times 1 or 2, sometimes 4 or 6, very rarely 12;" their 
Jilaments either capillary, or flat, lax and spreading, pro- 
ceeding from the receptacle beneath the germen; anthers 
attached by the base, linear, undivided, mostly pendulous, 
of 2 cells, bursting lengthwise. Germen with the rudiment 
of a single kernel only, which is attached by its base to the 
bottom; style cylindrical, or more commonly triangular, 
finally separating, either at the base, or more usually at a 
joint, a little way up, leaving the lower part to form a beak 
to the seed ; stigmas linear, downy, rarely cloven. Seed 
hard, often polished, coloured, and dotted, with as many 
angles as there are stigmas ; its chief bulk consisting of a 
firm albumen of the same shape; embryo simple, orbicular, 
flattened, situated in the base of the seed, on the outside 
of the albumen, as Mr. Brown observes in opposition to 
Goertner, who, with Jussieu, describes this organ as within 
the albumen -, plumida not discernible. 

"Vi^Q jlo-joers are ranged in sjnkes, various in length; the 
\ovfer ghimes of which are, many of them, in some cases, 
abortive and destitute of any organs of fecundation. 

I think nothing is gained by calling the seed of these plants 
a nut, on account of its hardness, which is but compara- 
tive ; there being no supernumerary integument to distin- 
guish this seed from others, acknowledged to be simple 
and naked.]

ing, there being only a very few thin and narrow ones, besides 
the close abrupt sheaths which embrace each stem. Spike smaller 
and blacker than in S. ccespitosus, but, except when starved, 
twice as long as the 2 outer glumes, which end in a rounded 
membranous border. Seed grey, shining, obtuse, with a brown 
point, and at the base 6 fine rough bristles. 

I prefer Lightfoofs unexceptionable and original name to the 
pedantic one of Ehrhart, foisted, like many other such, by him, 
into the Supplementum of Linnaeus, while printing ; contrary to 
the author's intention.

Root creeping, with downy fibres. Stems 4 to G inches high, round, 
quite smooth and even. Leaves 2, smooth throughout, semi- 
cylindrical, channelled, but not keeled, generally much shorter 
than the stem, which they embrace at the bottom with their 
sheaths. Compound spike ovate, flat, imperfectly 2-ranked, of a 
dark rusty brown. Bract ea often very short ; sometimes nearly 
equal to the whole spike, and leafy; often entirely wanting 
Flowers 2, 3 or 4. Glumes turgid, even and polished ; the 
outermost large, empty, as long as the partial spike to which it 
belongs. Stigm. 2. -Seed ovate, smooth, pointed at each end, 
flat on one side, tumid on the other, tipped with a short jagged 
beak left by the style, and certainly without any bristles at the 
base. This last character, faithfully expressed in Engl. Bot., 
effectually distinguishes this species from the last ; and at the 
same time proves the unimportance of these bristles for a generic 
character, the two species in question being so nearly allied, that 
good botanists have hardly been able to discriminate fhem.

Root creeping, forming large entangled tufts. Stems 3 feet high, 
acutely triangular throughout, pliant and cellular, with many 
transverse interruptions ; the point erect and rather sharp. Leaf 
solitary, very short, with a long close sheath. Spikes from a 
lateral cleft, 2 or 3 inches below the top, partly sessile, partly 
on rigid angular stalks ; all ovate, of numerous, closely imbri- 
cated, elliptical, concave, fringed, keeled, pointed, partly reddish, 
glumes. Sfam. 3, vvith 3 rough intermediate bristles. Stigm. 2, 
downy. Seed roundish, obtuse, smooth and polished, in which, 
as Schrader observes, it differs from the exotic -S. mucronatus, 
whose seed is minutely corrugated, with 5 or 6 rough bristles 
beneath. Our -S. triqueter has 3 or 4, scarcely more. /3, as far 
as I can discover, is but a variety, whose spikes are all sessile. 
Yet Plukenet's figure more resembles a Carolina species, S.

like S. lacustris, but the principal bractea is often longer, and 
more of the texture of the stem ; still evincing its true nature, 
as I apprehend, by being channelled ; though with regard to 
terminal or lateral inflorescence, the present species is inter-

articulation in the sfijle ; because, as he justly says, an 
actual joint would intercept the impregnation. But there 
is no question of any such thing. There is nothing ana- 
logous, in the vegetable body, to the joints in the limbs 
of animals. The term is used for a certain point where, 
after the original functions of the part have been per- 
formed, a solution of continuity takes place ; as in the 
rachis, or main stalk, of the spiked grasses, which becomes 
very brittle at each joint, when the seeds ripen, though 
originally continuous. The same may be observed in the 
stalks of leaves, and of fruits.]

First noticed in the isle of Skye, by Mr. John Mackay, in 1794. 

Perennial. Ji/ly. 

Root tufted, with many long fibres. Whole plant rather smaller 
than the preceding. Stems very numerous, 8 or 1 inches high, 
sometimes more, spreading loosely, with 1 or 2 tight purplish 
sheaths at the base. Leaves none. Spike smaller, more acute 
and slender, than in the last, and rather darker coloured. One 
or two of the lower flowers are often viviparous. Glumes obtuse, 
with a membranous edge. Stam. 3. Stigmas certainly 3, as is 
clearly expressed in Engl. Bot., though Professor Schrader, by a 
scarcely credible mistake in any body, but least of all in him, 
positively asserts that the painter has faultily drawn but 2 ! I 
presume moreover to persist in the correctness of the above sy- 
nonyms, contrary to his opinion. There being, as Schrader al- 
lows, 3 stigmas, the seed has one flat side, and 3 nearly equal an- 
gles, and is smaller and browner than that of E. palustris, having 
moreover a triangular beak, or point. There are 5 or 6 rough 
bristles at the base of the germen, often more or less deciduous. 
Dr. Wahlenberg declares that he has carefully examined these 
two species, and found them the same, the root not being creep- 
ing in either. Professor Hooker, following him, has accordingly 
made them varieties. I recommend to these excellent botanists 
to consider the above particulars, and have no doubt of their 
coming to a better authorized conclusion.

according to Ray and Plukenet. 

Perennial. August. 

Root fibrous, with slender runners. Stems numerous, erect, very 
slender, from 2 to 6 inches high, certainly quadrangular, though 
somewhat compressed, smooth, with a tight red sheath at the 
base. Leaves none, though there are many barren stems which 
resemble them. Spike minute, of 5 or 6 flowers. G/MÂ»?jes brown, 
acute, with a membranous edge. Siam. 3, their filaments flat, 
longer than the seed, under the base of which they remain at- 
tached, and hence, as Dr. Hooker well remarks, may have arisen 
a report of this species having bristles under the germen. I 
could never find any. The style is short, with 3 long stigmas. 
Seed whitish, elliptic-oblong, with many longitudinal furrows, 
and a small blunt beak. The seed of the lowest ^ower, though 
perfectly formed, sometimes remains diminutive and abortive. 
Kernel, according to Dr. Hooker, smooth, obovate.

Root slightly creeping. Stems tufted, jointed, smooth, finally 
12 â€” 15 inches high, with 1 or 2 inflated, strongly reticulated 
sheaths in the lower part, and below them several erect, slender, 
triangular, striated, sharp-pointed leaves, nearly as tall as the

thin, single-ribbed scales, and yellow prominent anthers ; when 
in seed very conspicuous, in May and June, from its copious, 
long, white, soft and smooth hairs, by means of which the little 
triangular seeds are finally carried away by the wind.

Smaller than the last, with which the leaves accord, except in 
being narrower, and somewhat shorter. The stem is triangular 
as low as the insertion of the first, or even second, leaf, but, as 
far as can be judged from dried specimens, appears to be cylin- 
drical at the bottom. Spikes from 2 to 8 or 9, their stalks some- 
what angular, compressed and striated, clothed with fine silky 
hairs. Glumes elliptical, flat, brownish-black, membranous, 
single-ribbed, except the outermost, which has sometimes 3 ribs.

The authors of the splendid, but unfortunately abortive. Flora

confounded our plant with the polystachion, his latifolium.

TRIANDRIA BIGYNJA. 

An entirely natui'al order, consisting of Grami7m. Linn. 4. 
Grafitinece, Juss. 10. Br. Pr. 168. See Grammar, 68, 69. 

No natural order can be more clear and distinct than this. 
But why Jussieu changed its old name Graviina, for 
Graminece, I cannot discover. The plants are not grassy, 
but grasses, ipsa gramina. To call them graminece, is to 
compare them to themselves. 

The foUovv^ing view of their characters, taken chiefly from 
Mr. Brown, will further illustrate what is contained in the 
Grammar. 

Flo'wers for the most part united ; sometimes monoecious ; 
more frequently imperfect in one or other of their organs 
of impregnation. 

Calyx of Linneeus, {gluma of Brown,) a husJc, or glume, con- 
taining 1 or IJlorets, or majiy Jlorets on a 2-ranked com- 
mon stalk, or receptacle : it is mostly of 2 unequal valves, 
rarely of 1 only, or entirely wanting. 

Corolla, {^perianth of Brown, ) a similar hush, or glume, al- 
most always of 2 valves, (rarely of but 1,) which are dis- 
similar; the outermost generally keeled, having 1, 3, or 
many longitudinal ribs, pointed, often cloven at the sum- 
mit, often bearing from below the top, a jointed, twisting, 
hygrometrical, often feathery, (rarely simple and straight,) 
awn : the innermost usually with 2 distant ribs, each at a 
lateral fold ; generally without any awns, but with 2 if 
any ; sometimes wanting. 

Nectary of Linnaeus, (squamulce of Brown,) 1, or 2 com- 
bined, minute, membranous or fleshy scales, beneath the 
germen, either both at one side, between the outer valve 
of the corolla and the stamens, or alternate with the valves, 
and opposite to each other ; sometimes entirely wanting. 

Stamens below the germen, definite, except in Pariana ,- Jila- 
ments long and capillary : anthers of 2 cells, oblong, pro- 
minent, pendulous, forked and divaricated at each end. 

Germen with a solitary kernel: styles mostly 2, either di- 
stinct, or partly combined, rai-ely 1 only, and still more 
rarely 3 ; Stigmas rough, or feathery, sometimes branched, 
or compound. 

Seed with a close, simple, firmly united, nnembranous, co- 
loured skin ; eithei- naked, and unconnected ; or inclosed 
in the permanent hardened valves of the corolla, consti- 



72 TRIANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. 

. tuting a spurious seed-vessel, often accompanied with a 
spiral or feathery, finally separating, awti ; alhmen mealy ; 
embryo closely applied to the outer side of the albumen, 
at the base, having a simple, shield-like, fleshy cotyledon, 
as durable as the albumen, to which it is attached, under 
the shin ; plumida external, simple, in a membranous 
sheath of its own, from whence, when burst, the primary 
leaves of the young plant are protruded. 

The genera of grasses are related to each other, as Mr. 
Brown observes, in many different directions ; so that no 
regular series can exhibit them all according to their na- 
tural affinity. This able observer describes S principal 
modifications of their fructification. 

In the first the calyx contains 1, 2, or many, Jlorcis. When 
the Jloret is solitary, the outer valve of the corolla is at the 
inside of the oute)', or smaller, valve of the calyx ; when 
there are 2 or more jlorets, they are either all perfect or 
complete as to stamens ?cnd^ pistils ; or the upper, or in- 
nermost, are gradually smaller, and less perfect, wanting 
stamens, or pistil, or both. Most of the Europjean ge- 
nera come under this section, though they differ in their 
ijlfloresceyice, as Agrcstis, Aira, PMeum, Alopecurus, Fes- 
ttica, Poa, Avena, Bromus, Triticum, Hordeum, &c. These 
genera, chiefly abounding in the temperate, and found 
also in the frigid, zone, are of much rarer occurrence, if 
not entirely wanting, m the torrid zones. 

The second section has either 2 Jlorets in each calyx, or by 
suppression of valves, or of organs of impregnation, one 
Jloret only ; the more perfect, or durable, Jloret being al- 
ways within, or next to, the inner valve of the calyx. To 
this very natural tribe belong Holcus of Brown, (for which 
I retain the name of Sorghum, see Rees's Cyclop, v. 33, 
and which is not found in Britain,) Andropogon, Ischce- 
mum, Saccharum, Panicum, &c., principally tropical 
gi'asses, rarely occurring in the temperate, and scarcely at 
all in the frigid, zones. 

The third section is characterized by having the interme- 
diate Jloret united, or most perfect, while those at each 
side are either neuter, or furnished at most with stamens 
only. Mr. Brown considers this tribe as less natural, as 
well as less extensive, than the two former. Hierocle, of 
which several species are found in the colder regions of 
each hemisphere, is an example of it, and to this genus 
Anthoxanthum bears a manifest I'elationship; see Diandria 



TRIANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Phalaris. 73 

Digynia, p. 3*7. Mr. Brown traces an analogous struc- 
ture in PomereuUa, Ehrharta, Tetrarrhena, Microlcena, 
and perhaj^s Phalaris. In this last section are compre- 
hended several genera, more or less anomalous in struc- 
ture, and certainly ill understood by botanists in general. 
They either have separated ^ow^rs, or a deficiency of 
calyx, or an unusual number of stamens. Most of them 
are tropical and aquatic grasses. 

Grasses yield more sustenance to man and to the larger 
animals, than all the rest of the vegetable kingdom to- 
gether. Their herbage, so perpetually springing, and so 
tenacious of life, accommodated, in one instance or other, 
to almost every climate, soil, and situation, affords to 
Nature, her most welcome clothing, and to the cultivator 
of the soil his chief riches. Nothing poisonous or inju- 
rious is found among them, if we except the intoxicating 
quality attributed to the seeds of Lolium; but many are 
gratefully aromatic. Their farinaceous albumen supplies 
man with the staff of life, in Wheat, Rye, Barley, Rice 
and Maize, and makes a great part of the food of many 
birds and small quadrupeds. 

As man cannot live on tasteless unmixed flour alone, so 
neither can cattle, in general, be supported by mere grass, 
without the addition of various plants, in themselves too 
acrid, bitter, salt, or narcotic, to be eaten unmixed. 
Spices, and a portion of animal food, supply us with the 
requisite stimulus, or additional nutriment : as the Ba- 
nunculus tribe, and many others, season the pasturage and 
fodder of cattle.

The synonyms in Villars and Hudson, as well as those of older

I submit to the correction of the great author last mentioned as

variegated with green and white, narrow at the base. Inner 
margin of the calyx often a little abrupt. The very short, ribbed, 
abrupt, crenate outer glume of the corolla characterizes this 
very distinct species. The whole plant is somewhat glaucous, 
and after flowering remains long bleached, and often blown 
about, on the sand. Professor Hooker's reference to Scheuchzer

Root of several, aggregate, ovate, solid, fleshy bulbs, sometimes 
one above the other, with fibres beneath. Stems solitary from 
the top of each bulb, slender, round, smooth, leafy, with 2 joints, 
occasionally bent at the lowermost, otherwise erect, about a

span high. Leaves narrow, striated, slightly channelled or con- 
cave ; those on the stem with long swelling sheaths. Stipula 
lanceolate, short. Spike racemose, but hardly branched, the 
partial stalks very short. Calyx-glumes broader, and less linear, 
than they appear in Engl. Bot., being somewhat dilated upward, 
and bordered at the keel ; they are minutely downy, or hoary 
all over, with purplish ribs and point, the keel and ribs fringed. 
Corolla bluntish, one third shorter than the calyx ; its awn 
twice as long. Anthers scarcely protruding beyond the glumes. 
Styles combined, short. Stigmas linear, downy, extending a little 
beyond the calyx. The calyx-glumes are certainly not combined 
in this spegies, which obliges me, with regret, to reject that part 
of Schreber's and Schrader's generic character. Foreign bota- 
nists seem unacquainted with this gi'ass, nor have all those of 
our own country known it well. None can be more invariably 
distinct.

Roots of many long fibres, from the lower joints of the branched,

tumid sheaths. Stipula oblong, very thin. Spikes erect, 1^ or 
2 inches long, bluntish, dense, but separable into short, branched

lobes, or tufts, with smooth flower-stalks. Calyx-glumes nearly 
equal, obtuse, purplish, combined at the base, minutely pointed, 
but terminating in a membrane which conceals the dark-co- 
loured point ; their sides hairy, and keels strongly fringed. Cor. 
shorter than the calyx, abrupt, irregularly notched, ribbed 
slightly at each side. Awn from below the middle, twice the 
length of the calyx. Anth. linear, yellow. Styles short ; accord- 
ing to Schrader combined at first, but subsequently distinct. 
Stigmas long, cylindrical, acute, downy. 
The root in var. y has extremely copious and long fibres, and one 
or two of the lower joints of the stem, owing to a dry barren 
situation, become oval and fleshy, as in Phleum pratense y, 
p. 75. This has by many been mistaken for A. 6?</6osms, which 
always grows in water, and differs essentially in character, as 
I trust can no longer be doubted.

Perennial. July. 

Like the preceding in habit, and in general structure; but our spe- 
cimens are much more luxuriant. Spike about 3 inches long, 
conspicuous for the orange colour of the anthers, which are still 
more peculiar on account of their short roundish figure. The 
shortness of the aw7is may be a variable circumstance. The sug- 
gestion of Dr. Withering first led me to propose this as a species, 
and 1 still wish to leave it for more accurate examination, though 
Professor Hooker is of a different opinion. I hope not to be 
thought precipitate or dogmatical, which faults 1 have had ex- 
perience enough to wish, at least, to avoid.

Root of many long slender fibres. Stems 1 to 3 inches high, erect, 
simple, slender, smooth, triangular, naked, except at the very 
bottom, where they are invested with the membranous sheaths 
of a few short, obtuse, channelled leaves. Stipula membranous, 
bluntish, cloven, but not deeply divided. Spikes solitary, simple, 
erect, of from 6 to 1 flowers, mostly sessile, alternate, erect ; 
2 or 3 of the lowermost only more or less stalked ; their common 
stalk zigzag, slender, smooth, angular, but not excavated as in 
the truly spiked grasses. FL, like the top of the stem, purplish. 
Cor. white and feathery. 

This little grass, well known on the coasts of France, soon disap- 
pears after shedding its seeds. The name of Chamagrostis, com- 
posed of Agrostis already established, is inadmissible. Mibora 
of Adanson, whose meaning is not explained, but which is 
partly, as it seems, composed of fiopoc, fodder, has been over- 
looked, because that author's names, so often founded on a bad

principle, have been generally neglected. The construction of 
this word is evidently incorrect, and to restore it would prove 
more inconvenient than instructive. See Beauvais Asr. introd. 6.

Cal. of 2 nearly equal, folded, keeled valves, cloven at the 
summit ; each with a terminal, straight, rough aivn, pro- 
ceeding from the keel ; containing a single floret. Cor: 
of 2, somewhat unequal, ovate, concave valves, much 
shorter than the calyx, and inclosed within it : the outer 
keeled, terminating in a rough awn ; the inner smallest, 
awnless, with 2 ribs, cloven at the summit. Filam. ca- 
pillary, about the length of the corolla. Anth. terminal, 
oblong, cloven at each end. Gennen oval. Styles short,

Agrostis, as generally understood by authors, is justly said 
by Mr. Brown to be an artificial genus, and therefore I 
should scarcely hesitate to admit Trichodium of Michaux 
and Schrader, as an artificial separation from it, differing 
only in having a single valve to the corolla. Such Schrader 
found to be the case with A. canina, but I do not, and 
therefore we have nothing to do with Trichodium in a 
British Flora.

Root creeping, with downy fibres, and many trailing leafy shoots. 
Stems several, more or less decumbent, and taking root, at the 
lower joints ; from 1 to 3 feet long, leafy, ascending, slender, 
smooth. Leaves roughish on both sides, narrow, especially in 
the radical tufts, where they are, as Professor Schrader remarks, 
quite setaceous, and by the presence of such tufts this species is 
readily distinguished from the awned varieties of A. vulgaris, 
without adverting to the corolla. Sheaths striated, smooth, Sti- 
pula lanceolate, elongated, finally torn ; in vulgaris this part is 
extremely short. Panicle spreading when in flower, otherwise 
collected into lobes or close tufts; the branches capillary, elastic, 
angular, rough, brownish purple. Fl. erect, shining. Valves of 
the calyx ovate, pointed, purple ; occasionally yellow, Sincl. 1 53. ; 
the outer one largest, with a rough keel ; inner smooth. Cor. 
membranous, white or greenish ; the larger valve ribbed, notched, 
about the length of the calyx, or rather shorter, with a jointed 
incurved awn, from below the middle of its keel, extending a 
little way beyond the point ; smaller valve often entirely want- 
ing, thovigh some flowers in every panicle usually have it, either 
diminutive, as in Engl. Bot., or nearly equal to the awned valve, 
as in a specimen before me. Leers, the most accurate of all ob- 
servers in this tribe of plants, says this valve is very often want- 
ing, but not always. Such a partial deficiency could hardly 
afford a specific, much less a generic, distinction. The awn 
varies in length, and is occasionally absent, as in var. /3, nothing 
being more uncertain than the dorsal awns of grasses. The 
terminal ones, whether of the calyx or corolla, are much more 
to be trusted.

Mr. Curtis, who first distinguished this grass, received it from his 
gardener Robert Squibb, from Piddletown heath, Devonshire. 
The late Earl of Gainsborough, and the present Bishop of Car- 
lisle, observed it in Hampshire ; the late Duchess Dowager of 
Portland at Weymouth ; and Mr. D. Turner in the Isle of Wight. 
Professor Link sent it from Portugal, where he found it common 
on heaths. 

Perennial. July, .August. 

Root rather woody, tufted, with strong downy fibres. Stems 8 â€” 12 
inches high, a little inclining, slender, nearly or quite smooth, 
leafy. Leaves pale glaucous green ; the radical ones involute, 
almost capillary, erect, acute, roughish, or downy ; those of the 
stem shorter, broader, with very long smooth sheaths. Stipula 
lanceolate, tender, often torn. Panicle erect, oblong, cylindri- 
cal, but little spreading at any period ; its branches angular, 
bristly. Fl. erect, pale purpli.sh. Cal. of 2 unequal, long and 
tapering, keeled, scarcely awned, valves, rough at the edges and 
keel, downy all over. Outer valve of the corolla lanceolate, 
shorter than the calyx, with a rough twisting awn from near the 
bottom, twice the length of the valve ; inner very small, oblong, 
about equal to the germen. Anth. purplish, deeply cloven at 
each end, prominent. Styles distinct. 

Very different from A. alpina of Willdenow, Sp. PL v. 1 .368, which

Perennial. Julij, August. 

Root tufted, strong, somewhat creeping. Stems 12 â€” 24 inches 
high ; in y 2 â€” 4 inches only ; erect or ascending, leafy, slender, 
striated, smooth to the touch ; their lowermost joints often 
throwing out roots. Leaves linear, narrow, taper-pointed, rather 
spreading, rough on both sides, with long, striated, smooth 
sheaths. Stipula extremely short and abrupt, by which, as Pro- 
fessor Schrader long ago noticed, all the varieties of this species, 
whether awned or not, are readily distinguished from A. canina, 
as also from alba. Panicle purplish, very delicate, slender, uni- 
formly divaricated, with equidistant, elastic, finely capillary 
branches, collected into small tufts after flowering ; their lower 
part smooth ; upper more or less rough, but the ultimate stalks 
are smooth. Fl. small, erect, shining. Valves of the cahjx lan- 
ceolate, concave, somewhat unequal, with membranous edges ; 
the keel of the larger often roughish. Cor. of 2 thin, very un- 
equal, valves ; the smaller notched at the summit, hairy at the 
base ; larger 3 -ribbed, shorter than the calyx, usually awnless, 
but sometimes, as in var. )3, and not unfrequently in y, furnished 
with a dorsal rough awn, about twice its own length. The an- 
thers project just beyond the calyx, and are oblong, cloven at 
each end. Styles very short. Stigm. densely featheiy. Seed 
ovate, tumid, especially in y, which is often, not always, infected 
with the smut, or ustilago. In S the glumes become, more or 
less, elongated and leafy, the fructification being transformed 
into a bud, and the panicle viviparous. This happens chiefly in 
shady or moist situations, where the whole plant is pale and 
slender ; in dry exposed spots it is dwarf, condensed, of a fine 
brownish pur])le all over.

A larger plant than A. vulgaris, from which it essentially and mani- 
festly differs, in having an elongated, ribbed, bluntish, mostly 
downy, finally torn, stipula ; whereas that of vulgaris is scarcely 
visible at all, or at most not a line in length. I concur with 
Professor Hooker and Mr. Bicheno in uniting A. stolonifera to 
alba, but by no means in perceiving any ambiguity between the 
latter and vulgaris. 

A. alba has long, decumbent, more or less branching, stems, send- 
ing out roots from tlieir lower joints. The leaves are broad, flat. 



Oi TRIANDUIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Cynodon. 

taper-pointed, ribbed, very rough on both sides to the touch, 
especially at the edges. Sheaths long, smooth in my specimens, 
though Professor Schrader informs me they are occasionally 
rough. Panicle 4 â€” 6 inches long, alternately lobed, or divided 
into several large, half-whorled, bundles, of extremely unequal, 
angular, rough branches ; the lowermost particularly crowded, 
generally much more so than is represented in Engl. Bot. 
Calyx-glumes keeled, acute, slightly unequal, rather tumid ; 
their keels either entirely or partially rough with little bristles ; 
their sides smooth ; their edges not more membranous than the 
other part, in wliich last character they differ from the vulgaris. 
Cor. of 2 unequal valves ; the larger ribbed, and occasionally 
awned from a little below the summit. Styles very short. 
Stigmas thick, feathery. The calyx is either greenish white* or 
brownish purple, but not so constantly, in different individuals, 
as to mark a durable variety. 

In B the stem is more extensively creeping, sometimes floating j 
but the chief difference consists in the still more dense and 
tufted lobes of the panicle, as in Engl. Bot. and Leers t. 4,f. 5. 
The calyx, besides, is generally rough all over, with little bristly 
points ; and I had thought, with the accurate Schrader, that this 
roughness would afford a specific character ; but it is wanting 
in the Liverpool specimens, see Engl. Bot. t. 1532. 

y is distinguished by an elongation of the cal. 8^ cor., the Jlowers 
being imperfect, and many of them transformed to leafy buds. 
The lower branches of the panicle are abortive. 

A. coarctata, Ehrh. Calam. 133, referred by Schrader to the purple 
variety, or rather state, of our alba, appears extremely different 
in its narrow involute leaves, trailing radical shoots, and slender 
loose panicle. I have seen nothing like it in England. Ehrhart's 
specimen in his Calamaria precisely accords with one sent by 
Dr. Roth as his y^. alpina; but it is a real Agrostis, neither A. al- 
pina, nor A. rupestris of Willdenow ; see Trichodium n. 2 & 3 
of Schrader; about which I find various errors, not concerning 
the British Flora.

is indubitably a native, though, like all annual plants, variable 
in its places of growth. 

Annual. July, August. 

Root fibrous. Stems numerous, bent arid decumbent at the base, 
then ascending, about a foot long, jointed, leafy, striated, smooth. 
Leaves broad, pointed, striated, wavy at the edges, besprinkled, 
like their long rather swelling sheaths, with little warts, many 
of which bear bristly hairs. Spikeshoxa 3 to 8, alternate, spread- 
ing, crowded at the top of the stem, many-flowered. Common 
stalk of each spike flat, wavy, winged, rough-edged, with a flat 
mid-rib at one side, the other beset with 2 rows of unequally 
cloven, two-flowered, short, erect partial-stalks. Fl. dark pur- 
plish, erect, elliptic-oblong. Largest valve of the calyx with 
usually five ribs, its edges rough or downy. Stigmas, and often 
Anthers, violet coloured. The specific name is said to have ori- 
ginated in the use made of this grass in Germany, which is to 
procure bleeding of the nose, by thrusting its spikes up the 
nostrils. 

Professor Schrader separates from this species, by the name of 
Syntherisma glabrum, what Leers has described, and represented 
in his t. 2.f. (5. I describe the native English plant, upon which 
Haller evidently founded his Digitaria. Jussieu copied him, even 
in his error respecting the character ; nor did he advert to the 
bivalve corolla, pointed out by Haller himself, in Panicum Dac- 
tylon, which forms an exception to their definition of Digitaria. 
1 have therefore concurred with Mr. Brown and other able bota- 
nists, in applying the name of Cynodon to the preceding genus, 
retaining Digitaria for this. The advanced state of our know- 
ledge requires the separation of both from Panicum, with whose 
character they have never been found well to accord.

Pennisetiim of Richard and Brown differs only in having a 
number of abortive flower-stalks, improperly called an in- 
volticj-um, as they have no share in the fructification. I 
therefore, notwithstanding these really great authorities, 
decline its adoption, there being no natural distinction of 
habit in its favour. 

Panicum is a very extensive genus, of large coarse grasses, 
mostly annual in Europe, of no agricultural use ; the in- 
jlorescence spiked or panicled ; the seeds in some instances 
used for food. The great imperfection of its secondary 
Jloret, so much resembling the calyx in one of its valves, 
might well lead to an error, which Schreber and Jussieu 
first corrected.

Smaller than the foregoing, but often so like it, that few persons 
can distinguish them. The spike however is neither lobed, nor 
whorled. Bristles more numerous, though often, as Ray found 
them, not so prominent. The most essential distinction, pointed 
out by Mr. Curtis, consists in the minute teeth of these bristles 
being directed forward or upward, not downward ; and we can 
hardly conceive this character to be variable. The neuter^oref 
is more frequently wanting in this species. The minute rough- 
ness of the corolla is like the last. Sometimes the spike, though 
usually green, has a purple tinge.

Annual. July. 

Root fibrous. Stems several, often 2 feet high, stout, leafy, smooth, 
with some tufts of radical leaves, and a few short, more spread- 
ing, stems, at their base. Leaves harsh, pointed, neither warty 
nor hairy. There are no stipulas of any kind, one represented in 
Â£wg-Z. jBo^. being an error. 6'AeaiAs compressed, striated, smooth. 
Panicle erect, rigid, unilateral, with angular rough-edged stallcs ; 
its lower branches rather distant, and zigzag; upper crowded; 
all with tufts of fine smooth bristles, originating in tubercles, at 
their base ; which bristles seem not essentially different from 
those of Richard's Pennisetum, and greatly invalidate the sup- 
posed character of that genus, of which our two foregoing species 
are examples. The larger valve of the calyx is ovate, concave, 
ribbed, bristly, pointed, or slightly awned; smaller cup-shaped, 
embracing the whole base of the flower. Cor. of the perfect 
floret 2 ovate awnless valves, very smooth, and even, finally 
horny, coating the seed ; the larger concave, obscurely ribbed ; 
the inner smaller, flattish : that of the neuter floret of 2 very 
dissimilar valves ; the outermost resembling the outer valve of 
the calyx, to which it has heretofore been supposed to belong, 
concave, ribbed, bristly, inflexed at the edges, and terminating 
in a rough, straight awn, generally short, as in Engl. Bot., but 
sometimes very long as in Leers, and Morison's/. 16 ; the in- 
nermost rather smaller, thinner, flat, notched at the tip, see 
Curtis,/. 5. Stam. and Pist. in the perfect fl. only, about as

Iiiflorescence panicled, either very loosely, or condensed into 
a spike. The genus is, as Mr. Brown remarks under his 
Eriachne, Pr. 183, entirely artificial, allied to 3 or 4- 
others, from which it differs in the small number of florets. 
We can therefore give no characteristic description of its 
habit, any further than that the stems are erect, jointed, 
and more or less leafy. Leaves generally narrow.

Perennial. July, August. 

Roots forming dense tufts ; their fibres downy. Stems simple, erect, 
round, about 6 inches high, or more ; most jointed and leafy be- 
low } a little downy above. Leaves rather stiff, linear, narrow, 
acute, flat, single-ribbed, with long, clasping, more or less downy 
or hairy sheaths, and a very short, slightly fringed, stipula. The 
edges of the leaves are rough and hairy, as Professor Schrader 
rightly observes, in opposition to my former descriptions, but 
this character varies in degree ; their upper surface is strongly 
ribbed. Panicle lanceolate, dense, erect, many-flowered, from 
1 to 4 or 5 inches long, compound and somewhat interrupted, 
conspicuous for its shining silvery hue, mixed with pale purple 
and green ; the common stalk densely downy. Fl. crowded, 
erect. Glumes all similar, compressed, finely pointed, with mem- 
branous edges. Florets very rarely 3. 

This species is a Festuca, except in the small number of florets.

Hoot creeping, or floating, with long, white, shining fibres. Stems 
floating, branched, leafy, smooth, very long, rising about 12 or 
18 inches above the water. Leaves linear, bluntish, flat/flaccid, 
partly floating, bright green, smooth, except at the edges. Sheaths 
lax, slightly compressed, smooth, with a prominent, broad, rather 
pointed, membranous stipula. Panicle erect, repeatedly branch- 
ed, smooth ; the branches unequal, aggregate, angular, many- 
flowered. Cahjx-valves not on a level, short, abrupt, notched, 
ribbed at the lower part, purplish, smooth. Florets much longer, 
one on a short stalk ; their valves oblong, even, purplish, notched 
at the end, strongly keeled, never avvned. Jnth. prominent, ob- 
long, yellow. Styles and stigmas short. The flowers abound 
with honey. When growing accidentally out of the water, this 
grass sometimes assumes a very dwarf habit. In natural affinity 
it comes near Poajluitans, distans, and maritima.

furrowed and roughish above ; their margins involute by drying j 
radical ones copious. Sheaths smooth. Stipula oblong, acute, 
often cloven. Panicle large, spreading horizontally, with innu- 
merable capillary, elastic, angular, wavy, rough branches. Fl. 
solitary, very small, purplish, shining, erect. Cal. pale and mem- 
branous at the edges ; purple at the back, with a rough keel. 
One floret sessile ; the other on a short hairy stalk, whichis more 
or less extended upwards, above the floret ; both beset with hairs 
at the base, which are about half as long as the keeled, very ab- 
rupt, notched valves of the corolla. Awn bent, springing from near 
the base of the outer valve of each floret, and seldom rising above 
it. Anth. purple, short and thick, concealing the still shorter 
styles and stigmas. This and the next approach Arunclo in habit, 
and even in the essential character of the hairs surrounding each 
floret. But in Arundo those hairs are always more copious, and 
as long as the glumes. All the following species moreover have 
a tuft of hair at the base of each floret, but in general so minute, 
that it could by no means authorize their union with Arundo. 
They rather agree with Avena in this character, the nature of 
their awns, and structure of their glumes. 

4. A. alpina. Smooth Alpine Hair-grass. 

Panicle rather close and upright. Florets the length of the 
calyx, acute ; one of them on a smooth stalk. Awn short,

Perennial. June, July. 

Habit very much like the last, but the stems are only half as tall, 
completely invested with the extremely long, smooth sheaths of 
the short upper leaves, which, as well as the radical leaves, are 
firmly involute, and pointed, so as to become awl-shaped. When 
flattened they are found deeply furrowed on the upper side ; but 
the back, though bluntly ribbed, is very smooth to the touch. 
Stipula oblong, bluntish, often torn. P<rÂ«jcte with nearly up- 
right and close branches, much fewer and less spreading than in 
A. ccEspitosa. The flowers however are larger, greener, vastly 
less numerous ; the upper ones, at least in mountainous places, 
generally viviparous, from the transformation of the spikelet to 
a bud, on whose first leaves the awns still remain ; see Ensl.

smooth, not downy. Awn short, from above the middle of the 
outer valve of ^achjloret, and overtopping its cloven point. 
I readily concur with the ingenious Dr. Wahlenberg, in taking this 
for the real A. alpina of Linnieus, though the Lapland specimen 
in his herbarium is unnamed Of Wahlenberg's A. atrupurpurea, 
Vahl's alpina, Fl. Dan. t.96l, there is no specimen at all ; nor 
does Linnaeus seem to have known this species, which is very 
different from our alpina, the panicle being more like flexuosa. 
Scheuchzer's synonym, /igr. 222, cannot, without the inspection 
of a specimen, be safely referred to either.

a fish-hook. That appendage is also twisted and recurved when 
dry, turning inward when moist. Seed coated by the hardened 
polished corolla.

Perennial. July. 

Root widely creeping, difficult of extirpation, but not very common 
or troublesome in arable land. Whole plant more slender than 
the former, and less downy. Panicle more loose and smoother, 
with conspicuous awns, which in drying bend at a right angle, 
and extend beyond the calyx. The upper ^ore^ is said to be oc- 
casionally perfect, as well as the lower. 

Villars refers both these grasses to Aira, and Curtis inclines to 
the same opinion ; but however miscellaneous that genus may 
be, they differ from it in having a permanent hardened corolla, 
forming a shining coat to the seed, which difference deserves 
more attention than it has generally received.

Root more or less knotty, partly from the swoln joints of the base 
of the stem, with downy fibres. Stetn 3 feet high, smooth, simple, 
jointed j the joints sometimes downy. Leaj^es deep green, rough- 
edged, and rather harsh to the touch, with long, striated sheaths. 
Stipula short, abrupt. Panicle erect, or a little drooping ; its 
branches rough, half- whorled, directed to one side. Calyx-valves 
lanceolate, acute, concave, veiy unequal. Fl. of the same shape, 
but larger ; the lower one most perfect, and most conspicuously 
awned ; their inner valves narrow, membranous, and flat. Anth. 
linear, cloven, hanging out at one side. S/y/es very short. Stig- 
ynas long, spreading horizontally, feathery on the upper side. 
Seed nearly cylindrical, coated with the hardened corolla. 

Professor Schrader (like Sir Thomas Cullum in his unfinished and 
unpublished Flora) distinguishes the most bulbous state of this 
grass as a species, by the name of H. bulbosus. It is but just 
to record that Linnaeus, by a note in his copy of Scheuchzer, 
seems to have had a similar intention. Yet 1 am persuaded that 
a dry or fluctuating soil causes the production or increase of 
these bulbs, as in Phleuni pratense nodosum ; and moreover that 
the occasional downiness of the joints may be attributed to the 
same cause. In natural affinity this plant is certainly an Avena. 
The awns vary in length as in many other instances.

A vei'y natural genus of grasses, as Mr. Brown observes, 
" natives of the colder regions of both hemispheres." All 
the known species are remarkable for a fragrant scent 
when drying, resembling that of Anthoxanthum, but su- 
perior in degree, which is esteemed in Sweden to have a 
narcotic effect. Mr. Brown, with his usual acuteness, 
traces a further affinity to our Vernal-grass, in the 2 sta- 
mens of the perfect j?o;e^ of Hierochloe, and in the rudi- 
ments of 2 lateral neuter j^orrfs in Anthoxanthum. Such 
he considers what the writer of this, and all preceding 
botanists, have taken for the awned valves of the corolla^ 
our nectary being the supposed corolla of his central, and 
only perfect, jloret. I have the greatest deference even 
for the theoretical speculations of my ingenious and can- 
did friend; but this, considering the structure of the parts, 
and the analogy of ether grasses, appears too paradoxical. 
It is, however, like all that comes from him, worthy of 
consideration; and may possibly be confirmed by a deeper 
insight into the real nature of the parts of fructification in 
this very peculiar natural order, in which, above all others 
perhaps, an indetermination of structure is remarkable. 

The generic distinction between this genus and Holcus is 
confirmed by the loose seed and unhardened coi'olla^ which 
characters did not escape the learned Schrader. All the 
species seem to be perennial, beai'ing either flat or invo- 
lute, smooth leaves, and panicled, yellowish Jlowers, with 
a silvery gloss. They turn brown by age or drying, but 
retain their polish.

Perennial. May, June. 

Root creeping extensively. Stems 12 â€” 18 inches high, erect, leafy, 
smooth. Leaves rather broad, flat, naked ; rough at the edges ; 
those on the stem with very long shenths, though tlie uppermost 
leaf is often diminished almost to nothing. Stipula short and 
broad, rather acute. Panicle erect, with slender wavy branches, 
directed most to one side. Fl. erect, broadly ovate, tumid, gi-een- 
ish yellow, variegated with purple or brown." Florets not quite 
filling the calyx. Awns not prominent. 

I have not examined British specimens, so as to make a full au- 
thentic description of our native plant, but the above particulars 
agree with the foreign specimens in my possession. This species 
and Professor Schrader's australis are both glued upon the same 
paper in the Linneean hei'barium, without any indication where 
they were gathered, or any mark of distinction between them. 
A very accurate German botanist Mr. Schkuhr first distinguish- 
ed them by the nectary, which in the australis is roundish ; and 
one of its barren Jlorets moreover has a large prominent awn. 
To these characters we may add that the glumes are all rather 
longer and more lanceolate, ihe flowers less tumid. Both species 
are doubtless included under Holcus odoratus, Linn. Sp. PL 
1485 J but the Swedish and Lapland plant appears, by what 
Swartz always sent to Schrader, to be Hierpchloe borealis, w^hich 
is evidently figured in Flora Danica. 

H. borealis is said to be used, at high festivals, for strewing the 
churches in Prussia, as Acorus Calamus has, time out of mind, 
been employed in the Cathedral and streets of Norwich, on the 
mayor's day.

the back ; besprinkled with hairs on the upper surface, particu-

part branched stigmas, which last character is considered 
by that learned author as one of the most essential. It 
occurs however in Poa annua, trivialis, pratensis, and

perhaps in other indisputable species of that genus, whose 
characters will be given hereafter. As to the present tribe, 
the writer of this has long been convinced of their natu-

Root long and creeping, or partly floating. Stems ascending, round, 
striated, leafy, smooth, hollow, tender, partly decumbent on the 
surface of the water, as are many of the long, linear, obtuse, flat, 
smooth leaves. Sheaths long, compressed, very smcotli. Stipula 
pointed, often torn, decurrent. Panicle nearly erect, long and 
narrow, doubly but sparingly branched, the branches roughish, 
rather turned to one side, tor the most part erect, but while 
flowering strongly divaricated for a timÂ«. Spikelets erect, long, 
linear, nearly cylindrical, of 8 â€” 12, rather lax, florets. Cat. mem- 
branous, obtuse, with a green keel, but no lateral ribs ; one 
valve much the largest. Outer valve of the cor. cylindrical, ob- 
tuse ; membranous, and often notched, at the summit ; mi- 
nutely downy under a high magnifier, furnished with no promi- 
nent keel, but with 7 equal, parallel, roughish ribs, besides a 
short intermediate one, on each side of the central rib, at the 
t)ottomj inner valve flat, inflexed at the edges, with a marginal 
rib, as in most of the true grasses, the summit cloven. Nect. 
thick and glandular, scarcely lobed. Anth. much contracted 
after flowering. Germ, elliptical. Styles distinct. Stigmas 
large and bushy, being, as Curtis and Brown remark, repeat- 
edly compound. Seed elliptic-oblong, with a deep furrow at 
one side. 

Loesel describes the mode of collecting the seeds for food, of which 
a more ample account may be seen in the FL Londinensis. They 
are said to be very sweet, especially before they arrive at matu- 
rity ; whence the name of Manna grass, which, no doubt, sug- 
gested to Mr. Brown the generic name. The fine sharp bran is 
said to kill intestinal worms in horses. 

The ^oÂ«;e)s, like those of Aba aquatica, have a sweet taste. Tlie 
nectary is really a secretory gland.

Root moderately creeping, with downy fibres. Stems obliquely as- 
cending in the lower part, then erect and often crowded together, 
near a foot high, remarkably compressed, by which this species 
mav readily be known, as also by a sudden contraction where 
the panicle begins. Tlie branches of the latter are acutely an- 
gular, rough, spreading considerably while in flower, but close 
and erect both before and after. Leaves short, narrow, rough- 
ish, especially at the edges, with long, compressed sheaths, and 
a short obtuse stipula. The whole plant is more or less glau- 
cous. Calyx-glumes 3-ribbed. Florets from 3 to 8 or 9, connected 
at the base by a mass of white folded threads, as fine and soft 
as a spider's web, which may be drawn out to a considerable 
length. The outer valve of the cor. has 5 not very conspicuous 
ribs, and is rough at the keel ; purplish ujyA^ards ; silvery and 
membranous at the margin. Stigmas slender. 

Schrader's remarks seem to imply that the web is occasionally 
wanting, in which I apprehend some mistake. 

This grass, though not succulent, is eaten by all cattle, but cannot 
be cultivated in moist or manured ground. Its produce any 
where is far from abundant,

Root fibrous, tufted, not creeping. Stem 4 â€” 12 inches high, erect,

round, striated, and smooth at the top, with frequently a tinge 
of pui-ple. Lec/iJes linear, rather broad,fiat, many-ribbed, bluntisli 
with a small point, rough at the edges and sometimes on the 
upper side ; a little glaucous beneath : radkal ones numerous, 
tufted, some of them narrower, spreading, with smooth lax 
sheaths, and short blunt stipulas ; those of the stem having much 
longer sheaths, each crovv'ned with a lanceolate, often torn, sti- 
pula. Panicle spreading, short, somewliat ovate, or triangular, 
its branches angular, wavy, nearly smooth, mostly in pairs, re- 
peatedly subdivided. Spikelets so broad as to be often almost 
heart-shaped, usually of A florets, in cultivated specimens of 6, I 
have never seen 9 or 1 1 , as observed by Schrader. Glumes con- 
cave, keeled, moderately compressed, green at the back, purple 
at the sides, membranous and white at the edges, those of the 
calyx 3-ribbed, much resembling the outer valve of the cor., ex- 
cept that the lower half of the latter is silky, especially the keel, 
and the base of each floret bears several longish straight hairs, 
but the complicated web is wanting; inner valve finely fringed 
at the ribs. Stigmas feathery, but according to Mr. Sowerby's 
observation, slender, and I cannot ascertain whether they are 
compound or not. The whole panicle often consists of buds in- 
stead of real florets, particularly in wet seasons. There is also 
a densely tufted variety, represented in Mr. Knapp's <â€¢ 1 17.

Panicle rather close, with us more or less zigzag, especially 
the lower part. Spikeleis not heart-shaped, but all ovate, of 3 
Jlorets, rarely 4, or 2, glaucous, coloured like those of P. alpina,

connecting complicated web at their bases, while the keel only 
of each, not the sides, is silky.

crop of linear, keeled, slightly glaucous leaves, serrated with fine 
sharp marginal teeth, is produced, affording a grateful pasturage 
for cattle, and withering by the time when summer feed abounds. 
Their sheaths are broad, smooth, partly striated, rather lax, often 
purplish. Stipulas all lanceolate, acute, of a moderate length, 
considerably decurrent. Stem 4 or 5 inches high. Panicle ovate- 
oblong, less spreading and lax than in either of the two last, and 
scarcely at all zigzag. Spikelets of hardly more than A florets, 
usually of 3, ovate, pale, variegated with green and a violet pur- 
ple, somewhat shining, externally smooth, except the rough keel 
of the calyx. Outer valve of the cor. ovate and acute, as in the 
last, silky near the margin, hairy at the keel with a continuation 
of the complicated, not very copious, web, which connects the 
bases of the florets ; inner strongly fringed. Stigmas slender, 
and, as far as I can judge, simply feathery. 

1 find no difference between this grass and what abounds in Ger- 
many, France and Italy, in the early spring, except that the lat- 
ter, in the streets of Rome, is usually viviparous, which circum- 
stance has not been observed in England. Morison's sect.b.t.5.

represent this ; and possibly /. 2. of the plate last quoted 'may 
be the much larger oriental variety, preserved in the Linnaan 
herbarium, and alluded to in Engl. Bot. as a distinct species. 
It looks very different, having long and narrow leaves, but is 
certainly what Linnagus intended by his variety /3. I have other 
viviparous specimens, which evince a most Proteus-like nature 
in Poa bulhosa, if they really belong to it ; but this question is 
here out of place.

leafy, with several knots ; the naked part cylindrical, roughish 
to the touch, as are the edges and backs of the flat, slightly 
spreading, lax, linear, deep-green leaves. In their long "com- 
pressed slieaths also a slight roughness is sometimes perceptible. 
Stipula acute, oblong, or lanceolate, 1 J or 2 lines long, as no- 
ticed by Scheuchzer, Hudson and Curtis, by which this species 
is invariably distinguished from the foUovving. Scheuchzer's 
synonyms of each, misapplied by Linnreus and all his followers, 
see Fl. Br., are at length settled by the accurate Schrader. 
Haller, I have authority to say, did not well discriminate these 
two grasses ; and Linnzeus has recorded under P. pratensis, his 
own ignorance of their distinctions, and those of 2 others, which 
Willdenow has strangely perverted, so as to include the widely 
different P. annua, and exclude alpina, which indeed is not less 
-distinct. Paniclelarge, spreading, with half-whorled, horizontal, 
wavy, angular, rough, compound, but very unequal, branches. 
Spikelets ovate, of three, sometimes only two, florets, whose 
glumes are rough at the keel. Outer valve of the corolla lan- 
ceolate, acute, concave, moderately compressed, rather longer 
than the calyx, keeled ; smooth, with 2 lateral ribs, at each 
side ; membranous at the point ; inner lanceolate, acute, scarcely 
cloven, or if so, the minute segments are convolute and com- 
bined, its edges inflexed, smooth. The bases of the ^ore^s are 
attached to the receptacle and to each other by a few long, very 
slender, convoluted filaments, which may be pulled out to a 
considerable extent. 'Nectary ovate, deeply cloven, acute. An- 
thers deeply divided at each end, with spreading lobes. Germ. 
ovate. Styles very short. Stigmas large, spreading, feathery, 
repeatedly subdivided, as in the genus Glyceria. Seed lanceolate,

Mr. Curtis, deeply versed in the practical economy of grasses, de- 
clares this to be one of the most valuable for pasturage and hay, 
yielding abundantly, though not particularly early j and of the 
most excellent quality. 

The variety /3, of which I have an original specimen, is only a 
starved plant, with short and slender leaves.

Perennial. May, June. 

Root creeping, with horizontal runners. General a.spect of the 
plant very like the last, with which it has been usually con- 
founded, but the stem and leaves betray no roughness when 
drawn through the hand. The florets are mostly 4, sometimes 5, 
very rarely but 2, their connecting web very copious, as well as 
long and complicated, their keel often silky. The outer valve 
of the calyx has very prominent lateral ribs. But the clear and 
essential mark of this species, compared with the last, consists 
in its very short, abrupt, pointless stipula, which in every leaf, 
of every variety, proves constant and invariable. Scheuchzer, 
Hudson and Curtis have all observed this, we believe indepen- 
dently of each other, and following botanists have confirmed the 
truth of their remarks. The stigmas of P. pratensis are as much 
branched as those of P. irivialis. P. pratensis of Leers, 28. t. 6. 
f. 4, cited with doubt in Fl. Br., is referred by Schrader to his 
serotina, v. 1. 299. 

/3 differs chiefly in the narrowness of its leaves, which are involute, 
and somewhat rigid, with roughish sheaths, especially the lower 
ones. All authors, since the publication of Fl. Br., have con- 
curred with me in making it a variety only. 

y is remarkable for a glaucous hue of the whole herbage, less evi- 
dent in Ehrhart's own specimen of his P. humilis, which is cer- 
tainly my suhccerulea. The stem is but a span high ; the leaves 
short, broad and flat. The panicle is much smaller and less 
branched than in the common pratensis ; the spikelets similar, 

. except in their glaucous colour, more pointed calyx, and rather 
more turgid and less angular /^o;ef 5, 3 in number, whose con- 
necting web is extremely copious, so as to be visible without 
pulling them asunder. Nevertheless, 1 submit to the opinion of 
the accurate Schrader, who has, like myself, examined speci- 



TRIANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Poa. 127 

mens, and is a competent judge. The stipulas of the above 3 
varieties are all alike. 
As an object of agriculture P. pratensis is not less valuable than 
the trivialis. It is earlier in leaf, and will thrive with less 
moisture, though the latter produces, at last, a better crop. 
Mr. Curtis and several other able botanists have rendered great 
service to the farmer in directing his attention to such objects, 
and it is undoubtedly worth his while to be select in seed for 
grass lands. But, after all. Nature is supreme in the accommo- 
dation of particular grasses to certain soils and situations, and 
whatever we may sow, unless we have well studied her laws, 
she finally triumphs.

Perennial. June, July. 

The whole plant, in both varieties, is with us extremely and per- 
manently glaucous ; in Lachenal's specimens less so, especially 
the leaves. Root tufted, fibrous. Stems erect, 12 â€” 15 inche.s 
high, leafy, furnished with from 2 to 4 joints : round, striated, 
and almost perfectly smooth in the naked part above the leaves, 
which is only occasionally angular and rough-edged near the 
top. Leaves linear, bluntish, fiat, single-ribbed, roughish to the 
touch, except at the back towards the base. Sheaths striated, 
somewhat swelling, roughish, though sometimes in a very slight 
degree ; the upper ones as long as their respective leaves, or 
longer. Stipula mostly very short and blunt, not projecting out 
of the sheath ; but at the uppermost leaf, in both varieties, it is 
sometimes greatly elongated, lanceolate, acute, and externally 
downy. Panicle upright, spreading ; the branches 2, 3, or more, 
together, simple or variously compound, angular, rough with 
minute bristly teeth, especially near the flowers. Spikelets ov'dte.

erect, variegated with gUiucous-green, purple, and silvery white. 
Calyx-glumes ovate-lanceolate, very acute, strongly keeled, 
Smooth, except the upper part of the keel ; membranous at the 
edges ; the inner one largest, with a short rib near the keel at 
each side ; the outer single-ribbed. Florets 2 or 3 in the first 
variety 5 4,5, or more, in the second, /3, always longer than the 
calyx. Outer valve of the corolla ovate-lanceolate, either smooth 
or minutely downy, hairy at the base ; furnished with 5 ribs in-^ 
eluding the keel, which, like the 2 nearly marginal ribs, is 
clothed half way up with close silky hairs, the intermediate ribs 
being smooth, and often so little prominent as to be discoverable 
only by holding the glume against the light; inner valve oblong, 
slightly cloven, with inflexed edges, often rough at the fold. 
Neat., according to Mr. Sowerby, of 2 notched scales, but I 
suspect it to vary in this respect, as it does in size. Stjjles 
scarcely any. Stigmas large, feathery, and distinctly compound 
even in a dried specimen. 
j6 has broader leaves, and 4 or 5 Jlorets, even in a wild specimen 
from Mr. Turner ; in cultivated ones there are often six, in 
which case their common stalk is hairy, particularly close to 
each floret ; but this is essentially different from the folded web 
connecting the florets in other species. The calijx is often 
broader, and quite ovate, in this variety, but there are imper- 
ceptible gradations. The two varieties however remain constant, 
through a long course of cultivation, and I have specimens of the 
original glauca, raised from seed in Mr. Griffith's garden, quite 
unaltered. Dr. Wahlenberg observed the leaves of glauca to be 
often involute when dried ; ours seldom exhibit this character. 
All things considered, I agree with the very able botanist last 
named in reducing these two grasses, however different in 
aspect, to one species ; and am happy to concur also with my 
valued friend Professor Hooker in the same opinion ; but not 
in referring P. glauca to the very distinct and well-marked P. ne- 
moralis, though as Dr. Wahlenberg says it is an intermediate 
species, he cannot mean a doubtful one, between the latter and 
P. trivialis.

Most plentiful in the north of England, where it is very common j 
as also in woods on a chalky soil in the south. 

Perennial. June, July. 

Root fibrous, scarcely creeping. Whole plant very slender and 
delicate, I i or 2 feet high. Stems several, erect, slightly com- 
pressed, smooth, striated, leafy, with 4 or 5 joints. Leaves al- 
most all on the stem, grass-green, narrow, flat, with 3 principal 
ribs and many intermediate ones j more or less rough, espe- 
cially the mid-rib and edges ; tapering to a fine slender point ; 
the lowermost smooth at the back. Sheaths hardly so long as 
the leaves, compressed, nearly smooth. Stipula very short in 
all the leaves, and inclosed within the sheath, but visibly notched 
along the margin. PanJcZe erect, or slightly drooping to one side, 
very slender, with numerous, half-whorled, angular, rough, wavy, 
compound branches. Spikelets erect, pale green and white, with 
a purplish tinge j their general surface shining, and nearly 
smooth. Cal. of 2 unequal, lanceolate, taper-pointed, almost 
awned valves, each with 3 ribs ; the keel, or central rib, rough ; 
the margin of the larger, or innermost, much dilated and mem- 
branous. Florets 2 or 3, rarely 4. Outer valve of the cor. lan- 
ceolate, acute, with 5 ribs, of which the 2 marginal ones and 
the keel are finely silky at their lower part, the 2 intermediate 
ones smooth, and not very conspicuous, unless the glume be 
held against the light j inner valve narrow, rough-edged, cloven 
at the point. The base of each^orei is sometimes, not always, 
hairy, but there is no complicated web. Stigmas large and tufted. 
Mr. Sowerby found the nectary of 2 acute cloven scales, 

/S is of a firmer habit, less slender in eveiy part, with a more dense 
panicle, and sometimes more numerous ^ore^s. An original spe- 
cimen proves it Mr. Hudson's P. angustifolia, of which he sub- 
,jj^ sequently made ?jemoraZis a subordinate variety. But it is not 

angustifolia of Linnaeus, which belongs to pratensis. Neither is 
it trivialis of Leers, whose considerable web indicates an aflfinity 
to pratensis also. Morison's sect. 8. t. 5. /. 19, is, more safely 
perhaps, transferred from the present plant to that species. 

In Switzerland P. nemoralis often bears, on t\\e stems, rigid bristly 
tufts like radicles, analogous to the mossy balls of the Dog-Rose, 
and like them probably the effect of the puncture of some insect. 
See Bocc. Mus. t. 59. Scheuchz. It. 1. 38. t. 5. /. 1. This has 
not been noticed in Britain. Schrader makes it his var. /3; but 
it is rather an accident than a variety.

wavy. The corolla has 2, or more, dense tufts of shining bristles 
at its base, with 2 intermediate depressions. The middle tooth 
is flattened, and close-pressed, not extended into a bristly awn. 
When able botanists have much differed about the genus of any 
plant, it is likely to prove a new one, as is the case with this 
grass. Several species of the same genus are found in New 
Holland, and some on the mountains of South America. What- 
ever the other species of the learned DeCandoUe's Danthonia 
may be, this undoubtedly belongs to Mr. Brown's very natural 
genus of Triodia, which is enough for our purpose. It could 
not, when properly examined, be placed either in Festuca or Poa; 
still less, as some have thought, in Bromus or Melica.

In meadows, hedges, and shady places, common. 

Perennial. June â€” August. 

Root fibrous, tufted. Stem erect, straight, 2 feet high ; leafy be- 
low ; naked and roughish above. Leaves linear, flat, acute, dull 
green, spreading, striated, harsh, rough-edged. Sheaths rough, 
keeled, compressed. Stipula elongated, mostly torn. Panicle 
alternately branched ; branches angidar, stift',very rough, spread- 
ing, especially the lowermost, each bearing a compound, ovate 
or globular, dense tuft, of unilateral, bristly, crowded spikelets 
Calyx membranous, very unequal ; the outer valve 3-ribbcd,

rough at the keel. Florets 3 or 4, rarely solitary ; common 
stalk smooth. Outer valve of the cor. 5-ribhed, rough at the 
keel, with a short awn-like point ; inner fringed at the ribs. 
^nfh. pale fiolet, pendulous. 
In shady places, orchards, &c., this is a harsh coarse grass, not 
very acceptable to cattle j but when cultivated on dry open 
land, its quality becomes excellent, and the crop of tufted radi- 
cal leaves abundant.

pressed, clothed with the unaltered corolla, but quite loose. 

Hard, rigid, smooth, perennial, maritime grasses, with com- 
pound, close, unilateral spikes of numerous Jlotsoers. This 
genus is closely allied to Dactylis, under which it has been 
included by Linnaeus and most botanists ; but a compari- 
son of their characters, given above, will prove them very 
distinct. Schreber places Spartina in Triandria Mono- 
gynia ; but a partial, or temporary, combination of the 
2 styles of true Grasses is so common, and so various in 
species of the same genus, that it is best not to take it too 
strictl3^ There can be no reason to change the great 
Schreber's original name for Limnetis.

Perennial. August. 

Root creeping, with strong fibres. Whole plant hard, tough and 
rigid. Stems 10 â€” 20 inches high, several together, simple, 
ascending, round, leafy from top to bottom, smooth, jointed. 
Leaves numerous, straight, spreading, taper-pointed, keeled, 
channelled, striated, of a dull green, smooth ; involute when 
dry. Sheaths striated, smooth, very long, investing each other 
far above their respective knots ; their lower part remaining of 
a fibrous spongy texture, after the upper part and its leaf are 
gone. Stipula short and jagged. Spikes 2, rarely 3, rising just 
above the short uppermost leaf, erect, straight, dose together. 
Common stalk simple, angular, with a linear hollow to receive 
each spikelet, but not jointed. Spikelets imbricated, in 2 rows, 
lateral, lanceolate, their glumes all more or less downy or silky. 
Outer valve of the calyx narrow, acute ; inner much broader 
and longer ; membranous and cloven at the top, with a short, 
thick, horny, intermediate point. Floret solitary. Valves of the 
cor. less downy, acute, entire, finely striated. Nect. none, as 
Schrader also observes, Germen lanceolate. Styles combined 
about 3 fourths of their length. Stigmas slender, prominent.

Spikelets in pairs ; one entirely neuter, of numerous, two- 
ranked, lanceolate, concave, pointed or awned, empty 
glumes ; the other parallel to it, of several ^or^-^s. Cal. of 
2 equal, lanceolate, membranous, concave, single-ribbed, 
keeled, taper-pointed, awned valves, containing two or 
three ^evkct Jlorets, the first sessile, the rest stalked, with 
an occasional rudiment of more. Cor. wanting in the neu- 
ter spikelet; in the perfect one of 2 unequal lanceolate 
valves ; the outermost concave, keeled, more or less awned 
at the summit, the awn straight ; inner two-ribbed, ui- 
flexed at the. edges, cloven at the point, awnless. Nect. of 
2 acute scales. Filam. capillary, shorter than the glumes. 
Anth. linear, cloven at each end. Germen elliptical. Styles 
very short, distinct. Stigmas long, cylindrical, feathery. 
Seed loose, invested with the unchanged corolla, elliptic- 
oblong, with a furrow along the upper side. 

The curolla is certainly not, as Schrader defines it, united

with the seed, though Schreber's account of its " closely 
enfolding the seed and not separating," might suggest 
such an idea ; for Schrader, so exact in what he observes 
with his own eyes, does not describe the seed, as seen by 
himself, in any of his species. In fact, the substance of 
tlie corolla remains unchanged, and the seed is as little 
attached to it, in either of our species, as in any grass 
whatever. 
Roots amiual, or perennial. Stems erect, leafy. Spikes dense, 
simple or compound, assuming a crested appearance from 
the neuter sjpikelets, mostly concealing the perfect ones.

Perennial. June, July. 

Root tufted, with long- simple fibres. Steins several, 1 2 â€” 18 inches 
high, .simple, rigid, round, smooth, most leafy in the lower part ; 
remaining brown and withered, with their dry empty spikes, 
through the latter part of summer, and making too conspicuous 
a figure on lawns about houses. Leaves bright green, short, 
narrow, smooth ; with long, smooth, striated sheaths. Stipula 
rather short and abrupt. Spike erect, rigid, linear, green, uni- 
lateral, about 2 inches long, with a wavy, rough stalk. Anth. 
prominent, pendulous, purple. Outer valve of the corolla with 
a short awn. Glumes all permanent, especially the neuter spike- 
lets. Seed elliptic-oblong, acute, filling the valves of the corolla. 

A valuable grass in pastures, for sheep and deer, thriving on dry 
open ground, and, according to Mr. Sinclair, still better in wa-

Schreber and Schrader, great authorities, assert the seed to 
be attached to the corolla, as well as closely enveloped in 
its glumes. But on a careful examination of many of the 
most genuine species, this does not prove correct. There 
is no connection, or union of the parts in question ; nor 
is the corolla at all hardened, enlarged, or altered, as it 
alvk'ays is when miited with the ripening seed.

for a very glaucous hue in the herbage and glumes, which is un-

of late convinced me, that such a hue will not always, as I once

The root, leaves, and general habit, nearly agree with the last, of 
which most botanists have esteemed this plant a variety. Though, 
of course, aware of the strange alterations which take place in 
viviparous grasses, I have been induced to make a species of this, 
on account of the diversity of shape in the outer valve of each 
floret, which is not cylindrical, but ovate, compressed and keeled, 
as vrell as all over downy. These characters are seen in the very 
few .pikelets which are not viviparous. In those that are, the 
lowermost_^orefs are greatly elongated, and strongly ribbed, the 
upper gradually transformed into leaves, so that each spikelet 
becomes a bud ; for it is not the case with this, as in many other 
viviparous grasses, that the seed merely vegetates irt the husk, 
like corn in a wet harvest. There are, in fact, no organs of im- 
pregnation, nor any form or traces of a real seed. Botanists who 
can examine the plant at leisure, in its wild state, may perhaps 
meet with specimens bearing some perfect ^/ojt-ers, and the 
corolla will then settle the question. I leave it to their decision. 
Mr. Sinclair, who has well described the progress of this grass, 
justly asserts that it remains entirely viviparous in a garden. 
What he terms the germen, I presume to be the rudiment, or 
heart, of the bud, or gemma, originating in the w^^ev floret of 
each spikelet. 

The folded edges of the inner valve of the corolla, when it can 
be found, are always downy.

smooth. Leaves roughish at the edges and keel ; the lower ones 
long, very slender, rigid, acute, compressed, striated ; upper 
broader, and flat. Sheaths close, smooth. Stipula very short, 
cloven. PÂ«??ide oblong, much spreading when in flower ; the 
branches acutely angular, rough. Spikelets at first cylindrical, 
but becoming flattened by the expansion of the glumes. Calyx 
sharp-pointed. Florets keeled and considerably compressed, ge- 
nerally smooth, from 4 to 6 or 7, the uppermost often imperfect ; 
the outer valve tipped with a straight rough awn, scarcely half 
its own length ; inner roughish at the marginal ribs, slightly 
cloven at the point. Stiginas cylindrical. In /3 the outer valve 
of the corolla, not the calyx, is finely downy ; but there is no 
other difference. 

Whether Haller's n. 1437 may be referred likewise to this species, 
the best Swiss botanists have always been in doubt. 

Mr. Swayne has made a favourable report of this grass, as yielding 
a good and early crop, acceptable to all kinds of cattle, which 
Mr. Sinclair confirms. 

4. F. rubra. Creeping Fescue-grass.

The creeping root, which on the sea coast often extends to many 
feet, or even yards, in length, may surely be depended on as the 
specific character of this species. At least such is the opinion of 
Professor Schrader, confirmed by the long practical experience 
of Mr. Sinclair, The leaves also, at least the upper ones, are 
broader 5 and yet rather involute than, at any time, compressed. 
Their upper side is furrowed and downy ; the under smooth. 
Panicle often a little glaucous, but I can find no distinctive cha- 
racters in the fructification, except the notched nectaries, as 
drawn by Mr. Sowerby, should be constant. The downiness of 
th^ Jlorets varies, as in F. duriuscula.

Outer valve of the calyx extremely narrow, acute ; inner 3-ribbed,

Stigmas feathery, minute. Seed oblong, deeply channelled above, 
convex beneath, downy at the point, quite unconnected with 
the glumes, which remain unaltered. Schrader describes the 
flowers of this and the following with only one sta)iien, which 
we have not observed in England. Mr. Sowerby has drawn 3

Nearly akin to the last, with which every part of the fructification

wind on the ridge of some ruined wall. It is perhaps " the

Root fibrous, slightly downy. Stems several, from 6 to 14 inches 
high, erect, leafy nearly to the top, simple, very smooth. Leaves 
acute, somewhat involute ; very smooth at the back ; furrowed, 
and often hairy, on the upper side. Sheaths longer than the 
leaves, ribbed, smooth ; the uppermost large and inflated. Sti- 
pula short,- obtuse. Panicle rather close ; its stalks all com- 
pressed, dilated upwards, rough-edged. Spikelets erect, or a 
little turned to one side. Florets keeled, not cylindrical. Jw7is 
long, rough, often purplish. One valve of the calyx is so minute 
as to be scarcely discernible, by which character this species is 
readily known from all our other grasses, though it agrees in 
that respect with Stipa membranacea of Linnaeus. The latter is 
a true Festuca, scarcely diftering from this, indeed, except in 
being larger, with longitudinally {nrrowedjloiver-stalks. I be-

Root tufted, of many strong, partly woolly, fibres. Stems three or 
four feet high, erect, simple, leafy, round, striated, smooth, with 
several joints. Leaves nearly upright, a foot long, lanceolate, 
taper-pointed, dark green, broad, flat, with a mid-rib which is 
pale underneath, and several parallel, lateral, roughish ribs ; the 
interstices striated ; edges rough. Sheaths striated, smooth and 
naked, not hairy ; the upper ones longer than their leaves ; 
lower short. Stipula very short, brown or purplish, often jagged, 
with an acute auricle at each side, clasping the stem. Panicle a 
little drooping, twice compound, the primary branches 2 or 3 
together, the rest alternate, all angular and rough. Spikelets 
alternate, drooping, ovate, not half an inch long without the 
awns, generally of 4 or 5 perfect ^ore<s, with the rudiments of 
another. Valves of the calyx lanceolate, keeled, pointed ; the 
outer narrow, sometimes awl-shaped, withoutany lateral ribs ; in- 
ner with 3 rough ribs, including the keel. Outer valve of the cO' 
rolla ovate-lanceolate, scarcely keeled, 5 -ribbed at the upper part, 
smooth, acute, and often cloven, at the summit, the mid-rib ex- 
tended into a capillary, rough, whitish, often wavy, awn, half as 
long again as the glume ; inner valve very thin, a little con- 
cave, cloven at the point, its lateral ribs smooth to the naked 
eye, but appearing under a magnifier finely downy, as in others 
of this genus, not coarsely fringed as in Bromus. Nectary 
acutely cloven. GermeÂ« elliptic-oblong. Styles short. Stigmas 
feathery, oblong, scarcely compound. Seed oblong, dark brown, 
or purplish, covered with the unchanged corolla, but I believe 
not combined with either glume. 

|3 is a much more delicate, paler, and narrower-leaved grass, 
about 2 feet high, with a smaller, more upright, panicle ; the 
outer valve of the calyx sometimes a mere bristle. But though 
reckoned distinct by Linnaeus and Scheuchzer, it proves, when 
carefully examined, to be marked by no real specific character, 
the number oijlorets being undoubtedly variable.

their colour a deep green. Sheaths cylindrical, striated, roughish 
upwards ; those of the upper leaves very long. Stipula short, 
jagged ; the uppermost a little poinied. Panicle spreading

Cat. of one awl-shaped, and one linear valve, both pointed, but 
rather membranous than awned at the tip. Outer valve of the

membranous, with scarcely any traces of an awn, though some- 
times strongly keeled to the tip of the membrane, and in (3 
slightly awned occasionally ; inner valve cloven, its 2 ribs 
smooth, and brought so nearly together by a central fold of the 
membrane, as often to assume the appearance of a simple keel;

Styles very short. Stigmas cylindrical, feathery, small. 

j3 is a smaller plant, with much narrower leaves, and scarcely more 
than 2 perfect florets, the upper ones falling off early, for want 
of strength. I am entirely obliged to my friend Prof. Hooker,

Many botanists have taken this grass for a variety of our Glyceria 
fluitans, and more perhaps have overlooked it for Lolium perenne; 
yet it is certainly distinct f om both, as Mr. Curtis has well de- 
monstrated. The root is fibrous. Stems several, erect, 2 feet 
high, simple, leafy, round, very smooth, of a pale green like the 
rest of the plant. Leaves linear, narrow, flat, smooth ; with 
long smooth sheaths ; and extremely short stipulas, embracing 
the stem at each side with a small acute auricle, as in F. gigantea. 
Spike a span long, or more, generally unbranched, of many al- 
ternate, nearly or quite sessile, oblique, smooth, pale, upright, 
compressed spikelets, on a wavy, angular, common stalk, chan- 
nelled alternately to receive them, aiid rough at the angles, which 
droops more or less in the upper part. Valves of the calyx very 
unequal ; the smaller lodged in each channel of the stalk, linear- 
lanceolate, varying in size, sometimes wanting ; larger opposite, 
many-ribbed, bluntish. Florets 10 or 1 2, cylindrical ; smooth 
below ; compressed and keeled at the summit, with 2 slight ribs 
at each side, and roughish, ending in an acute membrane, some- 
times attended by a small point, like the rudiment of an awn ; 
inner valve nearly as large, downy at the ribs. Germen obovate. 
Styles very short. Stigmas' dtxiasXy featherv along the upper 
side. Tiie seeds are rarely perfected.

awned. Florets from 6 to 9, or more, imbricated, somewhat cy- 
lindrical ; keeled, ribbed, fringed, and hairy at the upper part, 
with a terminal au-n ,- inner valve linear, flat, abrupt, inflexedat 
the ribs, which are strongly fringed. Nect. of 2 acute scales. 
Germen elliptical. Styles very short. Stigmas small, feathery. 
Seed linear, channelled, quite unconnected with the glumes 
which enfold it. 
The perfectly loose seed has determined me to adopt the opinion 
of those eminent botanists, who, contrary to my former deter- 
mination, still refer this plant and the following to Festuca. The 
narrow cylindrical Jlorets, and terminal awns, strengthen this 
opinion ; though the inner valve of the corolla is, in F. sylvatica, 
more strongly fringed than is proper to the present genus. The 
original name, given by HudsoTi,is, however, more conveniently 
retained for this species, than for my F. calamaria, n. 9, as hav- 
ing been so generally in use.

Root fibrous, downy. Stem 3 feet high, round, smooth, with 4 or 
5 somewhat downy knots. Leaves linear, pointed, flat, with 
many minutely hairy ribs ; the edges, and upper side, besprinkled 
with longer hairs. Sheaths striated, smooth and naked. Stipula 
short and blunt. Panicle erect ; the lower branches whorled, 
and somewhat compound ; upper alternate and simple ; all an- 
gular and rough, spreading as the seed ripens. Spikelets ovate- 
oblong ; their Jtorets ixnbricated whilst in bloom ; minutely 
downy towards the edges and summit; convex at the back, with- 
out any keel ; obscurely 2-ribbed at each side ; subsequently, 
by the inflexion of their edges, the florets become cylindrical, 
and their common stalk appears between them. The apins are 
sometimes much shorter than the glumes, inserted below the 
bluntish clovea point, and more or less wavy. The inner valve 
is veiy obtuse, its ribs strongly toothed, or fringed, with distant 
bristles. Styles from the opposite sides of the germen, below 
the top. Seed elliptic-oblong ; convex and loose at the back ; 
channelled along the front, or upper surface, to which the chan- 
nelled permanent inner valve of the corolla is closely attached. 
As the seed ripens, the spikelets become pendulous.

much more dwarf, scarcely 2 or 3 inches, in dry barren places, 
when it becomes B. nanus of Weigel, Obs. 8. t. \.f. 9, as we have 
it from himself. The leaves are very soft to the touch, hoaiy 
with fine, short, dense hairs, as are also the sheaths, but the 
stem more frequently smooth, with downy joints, or knots. Sti- 
pula short, vfith an obtuse point. Panicle 2 or 3 inches long, 
hoary and downy all over, a little spreading when in full flower, 
but otherwise erect and close ; its branches half-whorled ; the 
ui)permost simple ; some of the rest more or less subdivided j 
ail angular and downy. Spikelets numerous, nearly erect in 
every stage of growth, ovate, acute, rather tumid. Glumes 
downy in every part, except occasionally at the base ; those of 
the calyx elliptical, acute ; the larger with 5 or 7 strong ribs, 
sometimes more ; the smaller with 3. Florets 7 â€” 10, rarely 
fewer, closely imbricated in every state, elliptical, concave and 
depressed, not at all cylindrical : the outer valve with 7 strong 
ribs, membranous at the margin, blunt and deeply cloven at the 
extremity, with a strong straight awn continued from the midrib, 
and about the length of the glume. Styles distant. Seed large, 
elliptical, depressed, nearly flat, united with both valves of the 
corolla, the inner one being obovate, entire, strongly fringed.

A very distinct species from the preceding, more slender in habit, 
and much less downy, not at all soft to the touch. The panicle 
is generally simple, its branches longer, and less divided, rough 
with minute bristles, not downy. Spikelets larger, more turgid, 
rough to the touch, but naked and shining. Outer valve of the 
corolla marked with 2 green ribs at each side, which are scarcely 
at all prominent, nor are there furrows between them as in 
B. mollis. No one who has seen the plants together can mistake 
them. The. florets vary in number from 5 to 10. Authentic spe- 
cimens, and Professor Schrader's accurate inquiries, have ena- 
bled me to correct the synonyms of this species, and of B. ar- 
vensis hereafter described. Much of the mass of error, which had 
always enveloped this genus, was by similar means cleared away 
in the 4th vol. of the Linnsan Society's Transactions ; but the 
confusion among German authors, who had in vain undertaken 
its particular illustration, could be set right by a consummate 
botanist of that country only.

Root small, fibrous. Stem a foot high, simple, smooth, striated, 
leafy except at the upper part. Leaves linear, narrow, many- 
ribbed, besprinkled with soft hairs. Sheaths clothed with hairs 
pointing downwards, like the two last species. Stipula short, 
blunt, hairy. Spikelets few, pendulous, large and tumid, full an 
inch long. Caltjx strongly ribbed. Florets from 8 to 12 or 15, 
closely imbricated. Outer valve of the corolla elliptical, con- 
cave, somewhat inflexed at the edges, with 3 or 4 crowded very 
evident ribs at each side, the whole surface either minutely 
downy, more or less, or densely hairy, as described by Buxbaum 
and Host ; the summit deeply cloven, furnished at the cleft 
with a strong, dorsal, rough, tapering, twisting awn, about the 
length of the glume, strongly divaricated when dry ; inner valve 
obtuse, entire, not one third so broad as the outer, strongly 
fringed with distant bristles, and attached to the upper concave 
side of the seed. Nectary permanent at the base of the seed, on 
the opposite convex side. 

Having never been able to see, in any collection, a native British 
specimen of this species, and having received B. secalinus from 
Sussex as squarrosus, by means of an old friend of Mr, Hud- 
son's, I have always doubted the accuracy of his report. If 
Mr. G. Don had ever seen the true plant, his correct eye could 
not have confounded it with any other ; and yet that it should 
be found " in various parts of Scotland," though generally con- 
fined to the south of Europe, seems, as Professor Hooker hints, 
not probable.

Perennial. July. 

Few plants, or their synonyms, have been less understood by the 
older botanists than this. Linnaeus had a specimen with a wrong 
synonym, but knew nothing of its history, nor has he any where 
described the species. It differs from all the foregoing in having 
a strong, perennial, blackish root, and the ribs of the inner valve 
of the corolla are finely downy, rather than fringed. These cha- 
racters belong to Festuca more than to Bromus ; and if the seed 
should prove entirely unconnected with the corolla, as I suspect. 
It would confirm the relationship of the present plant to the 
former genus. The numerous radical leaves are remarkable for 
being very narrow, and fringed unequally with long, white, up- 
right hairs ; those on the stem are broader, and nearly naked ; 
all of a fine deep green. 5/iea</is ribbed, mostly smooth ; now 
and then bearing a few hairs, intermixed with deflexed pube- 
scence. Stipula very short, finally torn. The stem is 2 or 3 feet 
high. Panicle erect and close, purplish, with yellow or saffron-

In moist woods and hedges. 

Annual, or biennial. July, August. 

Root of many stout, pale, spreading fibres. Stem erect, from 4 to 
6 feet high, round, leafy ; smooth in the upper part. Leaves 
spreading, deep green, lanceolate, pointed, harsh, many-ribbed, 
a foot long, and | of an inch broad, fringed at the edges, espe- 
cially towards the base, with coarse rigid hairs, variously di- 
rected. Sheaths ribbed, mostly very rough, with deflexed hairs. 
Stipula short, obtuse. Pa?iic/e a foot long, widely spreading; 
the branches seldom more than 2 or 3 together, very rough, the 
larger ones alternately subdivided. Spikelets obliquely pendu- 
lous, about an inch long, compressed. Calyx-valves very un- 
equal, pointed, compressed ; the outer smallest, single-ribbed ; 
inner with 3 ribs, hairy toward.s the margin. Outer valve of the 
corolla resembling the inner one of the calyx, hairy in like man- 
ner at the margin, but with 2 slight intermediate smooth ribs ; 
the keel extended into a nearly straight, stout, rough awn, 
shorter than the glume, scarcely distinguishable at the origin 
from its very slender cloven point ; inner valve concave, shorter, 
but not much narrower, obtuse, the ribs finely and rather closely 
fringed, iVec^ deeply cloven . -,S7?/te very short. Stigmas densely

feathery. Seed linear, cliannelled above, blunt and downy at the 
summit, slightly attached to the inner valve, not at all to the 
outer, sometimes indeed quite loose. 

This gigantic grass has, like the last species, some points of agree- 
ment with Festuca, especially in the shape of its glumes, the 
finer fringe of the inner one, and the narrow, almost perfectly 
loose, seed. The root however is certainly not perennial, nor the 
awn terminal. In agriculture this species is useless, but hardly 
in any way troublesome to the farmer. 

The exotic B. inermis is another ambiguous species, agreeing in 
shape of glumes, very short awns, and loose seed, with Festuca, to 
which genus it is referred by Schreber, Haller, and Moench. 

9. B. sterilis. Barren Brome-grass. 

Panicle drooping, mostly simple. Spikelets linear-lanceo- 
late, Floi'ets about seven, lanceolate, compressed, seven- 
ribbed, furrowed. Awns longer than the glumes. Leaves 
downy.

In fields, waste ground, hedges, and on walls, common. 

Annual. June, July. 

Root fibrous, small. Stems erect, 18 inches or 2 feet high, leafy, 
rather slender, round, smooth, sometimes taking root from the 
lower joints. Leaves linear, narrow, flaccid, soft and downy on 
both sides, with a few longer hairs at the edges towards the 
bottom. Sheaths striated, angular, clothed more or less with 
deflexed hairs. Stipula short, obtuse, finally torn. Panicle a span 
long, spreading, like the last, but smaller and less subdivided. 
Spikelets pendulous, lanceolate, rough to the touch, tinged with 
purpUsli brown, an inch long. Florets finally more remote, as 
well as more numerously and strongly ribbed, than the pre- 
ceding, with intermediate furrows ; the inner valve notched, its 
ribs more strongly fringed. Jwn purplish, half as long again as 
its glume. Nectary deeply divided. Stamens always 3, as in all 
theforegoing. Germ eÂ«obovate. 5<j/ies lateral, very short. Stigmas 
small, feathery, cylindrical. Seed lanceolate, channelled along 
the upper side, and united to the inner valve of the corolla.

The specific name alludes to the unprofitable nature of this grass 
for the farmer. To whatever genus B. asper belongs, the present 
species ought not to be separated from it, any more than the 
following. 

10. B. diandrus. Upright Annual Biome-grass. 

Panicle upright, a little spreading, scarcely subdivided. 
Florets lanceolate, with two close marginal ribs, and only 
two stamens.

Annual. June. 

Root fibrous, small. Stems from 6 to 12 or 14 inches high, erect, 
stiff, slender, round, smooth, leafy, with about 3 joints. Leaves 
less downy than in B. sterilis, as are also the sheaths. Stipula 
similar. Panicle totally different, being erect, tufted, and rather 
close. Spikelets also erect, purple or brownish. Florets essen- 
tially distinguished by having 2 strong ribs only, which are 
close together, adjoining to the membranous margin at each 
side. There are occasionally traces of an intermediate rib, in 
the upper part only, between these and the keel. Hence Pro- 
fessor Schrader describes 7 ribs, including, of course, the keel. 
Inner tjafee strongly fringed. iVec^. of 2 narrow scales. Stamens, 
whether in wild or luxuriant cultivated specimens, never more 
than 2, as Roth also asserts, and as Dr. Withering observed in 
Portugal. Styles short, lateral, much below the summit of the 
germen, to which Roth found the stamens likewise attached, but 
this circumstance is certainly not constant. Stigmas dense, fea- 
thery. Seed lanceolate, channelled, attached to the inner glume.

Whether more than one species be really confounded under the 
above synonyms, there being a vast difference of size in different 
specimens, even in the respective parts, few botanists are as yet 
perhaps competent to determine. I cannot question that my ac- 
curate friend Schrader has found, as he says, in some instances, 
3 stamens. This only increases the uncertainty. Content with 
describing English specimens, as I have seen them. I prefer the 
excellent name given by a supereminent English botanist j 
though not the less aware of the impropriety of rejecting an es- 
tablished appellation, however faulty, provided it be not altoge- 
ther false or absurd.

Cal. of 2 nearly equal, lanceolate, concave, lax, pointed 
valves, containing a solitary Jloret. Cor. of 2 valves, 
nearly equal in length ; the outer elliptic-lanceolate, in- 
volute, slightly keeled, with a very long, terminal, twist- 
ing awn, jointed, and finally separable, at the base ; inner

smooth. Nect. of 2 linear-lanceolate, membranous, pointed 
scales. Filam. shorter than the corolla. Aiith. linear, 
erect. Germ, oblong. Styles short, distinct. Stigmas cy- 
lindrical, feathery. Seed cylindrical, pointed, loose, closely 
enveloped in the hardened outer valve of the corolla, 
which is very sharp, and barbed with bristles, at the base, 
so as to penetrate and fix itself in the earth. 

Roots fibrous, generally tufted and perennial. Leaves slen- 
der, flat. Stems round, jointed, smooth, upright, leafy. 
Panicle simple or branched. Flowers erect, slender, with 
long awns, bent just above the twisting part; then straight; 
either feathery or naked.

162 TRIANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Avena. 

On dry mountainous rocks ; a doubtful native. 

Found by Dr. Richardson, in company with Thomas Lawson, on 
the lime-stone rocks hanging over a little valley, called Long 
Sleadale, about 6 miles north of Kendall, Westmoreland. Dille- 
nius. Nobody has been able to meet with it since. 

Perennial. June. 

Root fibrous, crowned with several stems, a foot high, and dense 
tufts of upright, long, narrow, acute, dark-green, roughish 
leaves. Sheaths striated, very long, especially the uppermost, 
which is also considerably dilated, and envelops the young pa- 
nicle, rising above it when in flower ; the leaf being recurved, 
pendulous, involute and striated. Stipula oblong, obtuse. Pani- 
cle simple, erect, of 6 or T Jlowers, whose elegant feathery awns, 
about a foot long, attract general attention, and are used for 
ornament, in dress, or otherwise.

branous-pointed, awnless valves, containing a lax spikelet, 
of several alternate Jlorets. Cor. of 2 unequal valves ; the 
outer firmer than the calyx, and about the same size, 
ovate, involute, so as to be nearly cylindrical, pointed at 
each end, concave ; deeply cloven at the summit, bearing 
from the middle of the back a stout aiim; spirally twisting 
in its lower part ; simple and tapering above ; spreading 
when dry ; inner valve ovate, smaller, awnless. Nect. or 
2 lanceolate scales. Filam. shorter than the corolla. 
Anth. rather short. Germ, obtuse. Styles somewhat la- 
teral, short, distinct. Stigmas densely feathery. Seed el- 
liptic-oblong, with a narrow channel along its upper side,

Annual. June, July. 

Root of several thick, vvhorled, woolly fibres. Stem a yard high, 
erect, simple, round, very smooth, most leafy below. Leaves 
spreading, flat, linear, finely ribbed, rough, sometimes hairy, as 
well as their thin smooth sheaths. Stipula short, abrupt, notched. 
Panicle large and spreading, with half-whorled, slender, rough, 
simple or compound, branches, which are tumid at the top. 
Spikelets drooping or pendulous. Calyx an inch long, green, 
many-ribbed, chafl^'y, smooth. Florets 2 or 3, tawny, obscurely 
ribbed ; finally brown, with copious tawny bristles. Awn 2 
inches long ; spiral, stout and brown in its lower part, which is 
an excellent hygrometer, vvell known to natural philosophers. 
The oblique scar at the base of each Jloret distinguishes this 
species from A. sativa, whose scar is transverse, and the glumes 
smooth. 

The flowers serve rustic fishermen, instead of artificial flies, to catch 
trout.

Root fibrous, tufted, downy. Stem 12 or 18 inches high, erect, 
stiff, with one joint near the bottom, from which originates the 
very long smooth sheath of the short uppermost leaf, investing 
the greater part of the stem. Most of the leaves are radical, 
tufted, rigid, finely serrated at their involute margins ; their 
sheaths broad, smooth, durable. Panicle erect, resembling a 
spike, many of the upper spikelets being sessile. Calyx-valves 
narrow, 3-ribbed. Florets 4 or 5, the outer valve roughish, 
ribbed, purplish, with a membranous point, often torn. Awn 
from above the middle, purplish, with a white tip. Inner valve

Perennial. July. 

Root of several strong downy fibres, tufted, not creeping. Stem 
2 feet high, erect, round, striated, smooth, leafy in the lower 
half. Leaves linear, rough-edged, or minutely serrated, flat, 
naked, with many rough ribs ; the radical ones folded, at least 
when dry, and their extreme margin inflexed ; but none of the 
leaves are involute, as in A. pratensis, nor so strongly serrated. 
Sheaths cylindrical, strongly ribbed, rough to the touch ; the 
uppermost very long. Stipula triangular, acute, jagged ; the 
uppermost somewhat elongated. Panicle 3 or 4 inches long, 
erect, of a pale silvery brown, but little variegated ; branches 
furrowed, or compressed, rough at the opposite sides with mi-

nute erect bristles; tumid and angular at the summit; the 
lowest divided, or branched ; the rest simple, erect, often very- 
short and thick. Spikelets erect, an inch long at most. Calyx- 
valves lanceolate, concave, each with 3 principal rough ribs, the 
poinis acute, thin and pellucid. Florets 5 or 6, two-ranked, ra- 
ther distant, each subtended by a large tuft of bristly hairs, 
slightly decurrent, but the rest of the partial stalk is nearly 
naked. Outer valve of the corolla much like the calyx, but 
somewhat rougher, and 5 -ribbed ; deeply cloven at the point. 
Awn terminating the keel about the middle of the glume, brown, 
rough, partly silky ; its lower half strongly twisted when dry ; 
upper bent variously, taper-pointed. The inner valve is lanceo- 
late, extremely thin, flat, with finely downy, not inflexed, edges, 
nor any traces of ribs ; the point acute, torn, not cloven. 
A specimen from ProfesKor Schrader of his A. planiculmis proves 
different from our plant ; having a strong widely-creeping root ; 
the stem, as well as the sheaths, which clothe its lower part, 
compressed ; leaves much broader, and all flat ; panicle a span 
long, more compound, variegated with pui-ple ; spikelets one 
third smaller ; and the hairs on their partial stalks much less 
tufted. 

6. K. flavescens. Yellow Oat-grass. 

Panicle much branched, spreading, erect. Florets about 
three, longer than the very unequal calyx. Leaves flat, 
a little downy. Root somewhat creeping.

unequal valves ; the outer largest, lanceolate, keeled, com- 
pressed, pointed; either entire or notched at the ex- 
tremity ; with or without an awn from some part of the

very smooth, with many knots. Leaves a foot long, or more, 
lanceolate, many-ribbed, rough-edged, tapering to a fine, almost 
capillary, point; ovate at the base; smoothest at the back. 
Sheaths long, close, striated, scarcely rough ; crowned with 
tufted silky hairs, which supply the place of a stipula. Panicle 
veiy large, repeatedly compound, the branches half-whorled, 
greatly subdivided, angular, nearly smooth, close, a little droop- 
ing to one side, and waving in the wind. Glumes brownish pur- 
ple, all narrow, and smooth, except the keel of the outer valve 
of the corolla, and the ribs of the inner. There is no awn. The 
hairs in this species spring rather from the common receptacle, 
or partial stalk ; so that the lowermost^oret is, as Schrader re- 
marks, almost without any, yet not quite so. The rest of the 
species answer more truly to the generic character, having the 
hairs on the corolla itself, and constituting a most natural well- 
defined genus ; from which nevertheless it would be very rash 
to separate A. Phragmites ; for to say nothing of their common 
habit, there are various gradations. Still less can the solitary 
Jlorets of many species cause them to constitute a separate ge- 
nus ; yet some have attempted this, by the very faulty appella- 
tion of Calamagrostis, compounded of two other established 
names ! 
The Common Reed is useful for thatching, garden-fences, &c., and 
is annually cut^ as a regular crop, for such purposes.

taper point, roughish ; a little glaucous underneath. Sheaths 
striated, scarcely rough, except the long upper one. Stipula lan- 
ceolate, acute, thin, soon torn. Panicle smaller, closer, more 
erect, and of a brighter purplish hue than in the last ; the 
branches rough, spreading when in flower only, beset with nu- 
merous, crowded flowers, directed to one side. Calyx-valves 
nearly equal, rough at the keel. Outer valve of the corolla about 
half as long as the calyx, membranous, flat, with 2 rough mar- 
ginal ribs at each side, and cloven at the point ; bearing from 
its back, about the middle, a twisting inflexed awn, which rises 
as high as the points of the calyx ; inner valve much smaller, 
slightly cloven. The soft hairs, originating from the base of each 
valve of the corolla, nearly surround the whole floret, and are 
about as long as the calyx, or finally somewhat longer, when 
they carry away the ripe seed. 
Linnaeus by mistake interchanged Scheuchzer's synonyms of this 
and A. Culamagrostis ; and thus some botanists, who trusted to 
his citations, rather than to his definitions and characters, were, 
as in other instances, misled.

One of the most valuable grasses for binding the sand of the sea 
shore, and raising those banks, which in Norfolk, and especially 
in Holland, are the chief defence of the country, against the en- 
croachments of the ocean. Elymus arenarius, Carex arenaria, 
and even Festuca rubra, contribute to the same end.

Well known to the farmer by the name of Rye-grass, or Ray- 
grass. It yields an early crop of hay upon high or sandy lands; 
and makes a fine turf, which however is said not to be lasting, 
except on a rich soil. Much valuable information concerning its 
cultivation and merits is collected by Professor Hooker, in his 
continuation of the Ft. Londlnensis. The result seems to be that 
this grass is best suited to the light land of Norfolk, where it 
first obtained its reputation.

As this plant rarely flowers on our coasts, it is often overlooked for 
Arundo arenaria,p. 171 ; but the short stipula essentially di- 
stinguishes this Elymus, which is perhaps the very best of all

This species most resembles H.murinum in general habit^butis on 
the whole rather smaller and more glaucous. The awns are all 
rougher, with minute bristly teeth. This roughness, and the 
great brittleness of the main stalk of the spike, cause consider- 
able inconvenience to horses in whose hay this grass chances to 
be intermixed. It sticks in small fragments to their gums, and 
produces inflammation. Luckily the plant is not of common 
occurrence ; but in the isle of Thanet, where it abounds, the 
effect just mentioned is notorious. Mr. Curtis records this cir- 
cumstance in Fl. Lond. fasc. 5, under t. 9, referring it to the 
common H. murinum, for he was not then practically acquainted 
with the difference between these two grasses, nor does he advert 
to it ; but he subsequently knew them well, and 1 have speci- 
mens from himself. The half-ovate form of the innermost valve 
of the calyx, clearly distinguishes H. maritimum, as Hudson well 
remarked. The two species, though similar, are obviously and 
sufficiently distinct.

Root long, creeping deeply and widely, so as to be very difficult 
of extirpation, jointed, clothed with membranous sheaths j the 
fibres downy. Stems slender, erect, 2 feet high, most leafy 
below ; round, striated, and smooth, at the top. Leaves of a 
dull, somewhat glaucous, green, linear, flat, spreading, gene- 
rally all directed one way ; their margin and upper side rough. 
Sheaths tight, ribbed, smooth, or a little hairy. Stipula short, 
finely notched. Spike 2 or 3 inches long, erect, flat, of nume- 
rous, pretty close, elliptic-oblong spikelets; the main stalk some- 
times hairy, especially at the edges. Florets from 4 to 8 or 9, 
the colour of the foliage. Valves of the calyx lanceolate, ribbed, 
pointed or awned. Outer valve of the corolla similar, but with 
fewer ribs, and those chiefly towards the summit, which ends 
either in a short point, continued from the keel, or in a terminal 
rough awn, various in length, but seldom longer than the glume 
itself; inner valve obtuse, or notched, awnless. The maritime 
variety y is rather stouter and shorter in habit, all over more or 
less glaucous, though variable in that respect, and certainly a 
mere variety. The leaves are often involute. 

Schrader describes a more remarkable state of this grass, figured 
in Leers 1. 1 2, /. 4, 1 , in which a great part of the spikelets in 
the lower portion of the spike are double, or in pairs, contrary 
to the generic character. But the creeping root_ distinguishes 
this variety from the following species, with which it is con- 
founded by Leers ; both being indeed considered by him as be- 
longing to T. repens.

In ^oods, and shady hedges, on a chalky, or limestone, soil. 

Perennial. July. 

Root of several downy stout fibres, not at all creeping. Stems 2 
feet high, leafy, round, minutely striated, very smooth. Leaves 
nearly upright, lanceolate, taper-pointed, thin, flat, bright green, 
rough on both sides j sometimes hairy. Sheaths of the lower 
ones only hairy. Stipula very short. Spike 3 or 4 inches long, 
a little inclining, close. Spikelets alternate, except the lower- 
most, which sometimes stand in pairs, side by side. Calyx lan- 
ceolate, with 3, sometimes 5, stout, smooth, very neat, ribs j 
the keel being not rough as represented in Engl. Bot., though 
the short terminal awn is sometimes so. Outer valve of the co- 
rolla ribbed at the top only, with a much longer, rough awn 
from the keel ; inner valve fringed. 

The fibrous root distinguishes this species from every variety of the 
last.

TRIANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Triticum. 185 

On steep banks, and rocks, by the sea side, between Arbroath and 
Montrose. Mr. G. Don. 

Perennial. July, but rarely. 

Root of several long, strong, very woolly fibres, suited to a sandy 
soil. Sterns ascending, 12 or 18 inches high, simple, wavy, slen- 
der, rigid, leafy ; hairy at the top. Leaves linear, keeled, taper- 
pointed, folded rather than involute, many-ribbed ; smooth be- 
neath ; very hairy on the upper side. Sheaths close, striated, 
smooth. Stipula scarcely any. Spike terminal, erect, an inch or 
more in length, pale, bluntish, compressed, of numerous small 
oblong spikelets, so closely crowded as to depress each other. 
Florets variable in number from 3 to 6 or 7, either smooth or 
hairy. Calyx-valves elliptic-oblong, with a terminal, straight, 
rough awn, as long as themselves ; their lateral ribs obsolete, 
or smoothed away, not turgid as in T. prostratum, a species next 
akin to this, but with a shorter, rounder, spike, annual root, and 
branched stem. The outer valve of the corolla resembles the 
calyx, but is longer ; inner notched at the summit, its margins 
inflexed, as usual, at the lateral ribs. 

Gmelin remarks that the hairiness of the leaves is variable. The 
spikelets, in one of the Linneean specimens, are extremely hairs'^; 
in another, like Mr. Don's, smooth. In one Siberian specimen 
they are viviparous, apparently after the manner of alpine grasses ; 
the transformed glumes singularly enlarged, and strongly ribbed, 

T. imbricatum of Marschall von Bierberstein, Fl. Taurico-Cauca- 
sica, V. 1 . 88, sent from the Gottingen garden by Professor 
Schrader, seems to differ from the cristatum in the much greater 
dimensions of its herbage only, the spike being very like that of 
our wild specimen, and but little larger. T. pectinatum of the 
same author is but the smooth state of cristatum ,- and I am well 
satisfied that pubescence is here of no importance.

Root small, fibrous. Stems weak and partly decumbent, branched 
from the bottom only, 4 or 5 inches high, round, leafy ; smooth 
below ; hairy and glutinous at the upper part, between the joints. 
Leaves hardly an inch long, spreading, single-ribbed, glaucous 
and rather succulent, quite entire and even at the edges ; ta- 
pering somewhat at the base into short, broad, combined foot- 
stalks. Flower-stalks about 5, terminal,umbellate, simple, spread- 
ing, at length partly reflexed ; with several small bracteas at 
their base. Calyx smooth, brownish. Petals white, with a tinge 
of red, elliptic-oblong, variously and unequally jagged at each 
side, not deeply and regularly cloven, as the character of Ceras- 
tium requires. Stott. in our specimens nevermore than 3. Stijles 
3. Teeth or valves of the capsule, when perfect, naturally 6. 
Seeds reddish. Professor Hooker has detailed, with great can- 
dour and accuracy, the difficulties attending the generic deter- 
mination of this plant. A new round-leaved species from Nepal, 
having similarly jagged petals, confirms my opinion of the essen- 
tial character ; for the corolla of the Carijophyllece, whose pre^ 
sence separates them widely, in the natural system, from their 
near allies, is found to afford their best generic distinctions.

3 following genera the same. See Grammar 127. 

[The first section in Jussieu, to which all our genera belong, 
is the genuine type of this order, as originally understood. 
It is marked by a fruit consisting of 2 naked seeds, of a 
roundish or perfectly globular figure, whose skin is either 
smooth, granulated, hairy, or prickly, and in Rubia is 
internally pulpy. Or this fruit may be considered as a 
pair of Utriculi ,â–  or membranous capsules without valves, 
see Grammar 23 ; Rubia having a twin berry. The 
latter accords with the sentiments of those who do not 
acknowledge the existence of naked seeds. The leaves 
are simple, undivided, 4 or more in each whorl ; their 
edges prickly rather than serrated. Flowers axillary or 
terminal, generally many together. 

These herbs are said to possess a diuretic quality. 

A prize was offered in 1 789, by the Academy of Sciences, 
&c., at Lyons, for the best botanical and economical 
treatise on the Linnsean Stellata ; and it was gained by the 
late M. Willemet of Nanci, whose work, forming a small 
octavo volume, was published at Strasburgh in 1791.]

Leaves 6 in a whorl, obovate, acute, entire, palish green j 
roughest at the edges and keel. Fl. in a sessile terminal umbel, 
enveloped with 1 or 2 of the upper whorls, whose leaves are 
narrower, often more numerous, than the rest. Cor. slender, of 
a pale purplish blue. Anth. tawny. Stigmas cajjitate. Fruit 
of 2 globular, closely combined seeds, roughish, crowned with 
the somewhat enlarged calyx. 

This is perhaps the only genuine species of Sherardia. Two others, 
muralis and erecta, may be seen in the Flora Gr<rca ; but these 
have oblong disunited seeds, whose crown is but obscure, and 
whose_^OM'ers are yellow, with simple stigmas. S. fruticosa of

at night, i-rwii rough with ascending bristles. The herb while 
drying has the scent of new hay, approaching to bitter almonds, 
or Heliotropium peruvianum, of which it retains a portion some

Dr. Withering's figure erroneously represents the stem clothed 
with long, straight, erect hairs, though his own specimen is as 
above described. Hence Professor Hooker judged this " a very 
doubtful species"; but without seeing the plant, which may well 
excuse his mistake ; for the species of this genus require accu- 
rate and minute investigation. The present turns brown in 
drying, which G. uUginosum does not. Other characters of the 
latter will be found in their proper place.

Perennial. August. 

Root and lateral shoots creeping. Whole phint of a rather bright 
green, as in Professor Hooker's excellent figure, which it retains 
when dry. The stems are brittle and wea!<, a foot high, sup- 
porting themselves on other plants, and sticking by their rough 
edges. Leaves pretty uniformly six in a whorl, except on the 
weak, or ultimate, shoots ; lanceolate inclining to obovate, their 
dilatation, if remarkable, being above the middle ; they end in 
a pale bristle, and the tip of the leaf itself is discoloured ; the 
edges are uniformly beset with minute, recurved, very sharp 
prickles, often accompanied with a less complete row of similar 
prickles, on the disk adjoining, directed the contrary way, which 
may deceive an incautious observer. The main rib has recurved 
prickles underneath, like the marginal ones. Fl. small, white, 
on terminal, forked, smooth, slightly panlcled, stalks. Anth. 
pale. Fruit small, dotted. Willderow places this among the 
rough-fruited species ; but his synonyms are so confused, it is 
impossible to ascertain what he intended. 

If the points and prickles of the leaves, as well as their shape, be 
duly observed, this plant can never be confounded with G. Wi- 
theringii, for the characters thence derived, though much neg- 
lected, are no less constant than curious.

scarcely at all obovate, except some of the lower ones, a little 
glaucous, copiously reticulated with veins ; smooth on both sides, 
even the midrib ; but the edges, and the adjoining portion of the 
disk above, bear a double row of hooked prickles, all directed

forward. By this the present plant differs essentially from G. uli- 
glnosum, as well as in its larger size, stouter habit, glaucous 
hue, and larger less obovate leaves, though their discoloured tips, 
and terminal bristles, agree. The j^oiuers of the present, however, 
are larger, far more numerous, and crowded into dense, terminal,

or two of the angles sometimes doubled. Leaves 8 in a whorl on 
the main stem ; 6 on the branches ; linear, scarcely at all lan- 
ceolate, destitute of veiny reticulations, smooth on both sides, 
the edges rough, especially tovi^ards the point, with sharp, shal- 
low serratures, or close bristles, hardly more than a simple, 
strictly marginal, row, pointing forwards. Panicles terminating 
the stem and upper branches, 3-forked, corymbose ; the upper 
ones aggregate. Stalks quite smooth. Cor. white, larger than 
in the last, with horizontal segments, each tipped with a short, 
taper, not bristly, point, various in length and direction. Stigmas 
globular, large. Fruit smooth, or slightly granulated. 

This comes very near G. erectum ; experience must prove how far

have a wild one from the late Mr. G. Don, as a new species, ex- 
actly agreeing therewith. G. austriacum, Jacq. Austr. t. 80, from 
the author, comes nearer to this than the figure indicates ; but 
the edges of its leaves are either quite smooth, or rough with a 
few recurved prickles. The leaves of these 3 species are more 
or less revolute, at least when dry. 

8. G. aristatum. Bearded Bed-straw.

The root appears by Boccone's figure, of which Barrelier's is a copy, 
to be woody. Both figures, except the solitary leaf, are dimi- 
nished. The stems are numerous, a foot high, upright, with co- 
pious spreading branches, square, very smooth. Leaves 6 in a 
whorl on the main stem, and often on the branches, though 
sometimes but 4 or 5 j the largest above an inch long, on short 
broad stalks, elliptic-lanceolate, flat, pliant, deep green on both 
sides, with many interbranching veins, smooth except the edges, 
which are very minutely prickly, Fl. white, in terminal, forked, 
aggregate, compound â– panicles, with perfectly smooth, slender, 
but not capillary, stalks. Segments of the cor. spreading, each 
tipped with a taper point of its own substance, as in the 2 last, 
not with a real bristle. Seeds becoming kidney-shaped as they 
ripen, with a central vacancy, smooth, or slightly granulated. 

This new addition to our Flora, sent by the late Mr. Don as G. erec- 
tum, is undoubtedly the original G. aristatum, described by 
Linnaeus in Sp. PL 152, with which he afterwards confounded 
. his Icpvigatum, Sp. PL 1667. But this latter proves on compa- 
rison, as he himself suspected, the same with sylvaticum, remark- 
able for its capillary panicle ; though it is the aristatum of many 
.succeeding authors, as far as they had any distinct ideas of that 
little-known plant. The fruit of G. sylvaticum is a small double 
globe, the globular seeds being closely combined ; the leaves are 
glaucous at the back ; the stem round ; in all which particulars 
it differs abundantly from our true aristatum. Morison, cited 
in HorL Kew. does not prove the plant he mentions, whatever 
It was, to have been cultivated in England ; for he only saw it 
dry, brought from Paris by Sherard.

This invariable character might have prevented Haller, Willde- 
now, and others, from confounding the two species, which in- 
deed differ in other respects. The powers of the present are 
greenish white, all three on each stalk generally perfect iu 
structure, though seldom all fertile. The fruit is a double globe, 
covered with bristly igranulations, and looks as if it had been 
shaven with a razor. ,

This resembles the common G. Aparine, hereafter described, in 
habit, but the leaves are sometimes shorter. Their general form 
is linear-lanceolate ; and they are each tipped with a pale hair, 
variable in length. They are from 6 to 8 or 9 in a whorl, naked 
on both sides ; the edges and keel rough with small recurved 
prickles, sucli as are found, much more sparingly, on the angles 
of the square stem. Flower-stalks opposite, from most of the 
whorls, rather longer than the leaves, not deflexed, but always 
erect, or spreading, rough, corymbose, each bearing 6 or 7 small, 
green, perfect flowers, with I or 2 floral leaves. Stigmas capi- 
tate. Germen quite smooth. Fruit of 2 kidney-shaped seeds, 
with a considerable central vacancy ; their surface smooth and 
even, except a slight ruggedness, apparently caused by drying. 
Vaillant's beautiful plate represents them hairy, which has caused 
some doubts as to his synonym. They may vary in this respect, 
like several others of this genus. His fig. b, still more hairy, 
belongs to V. Aparine.

Perennial. July, August. 

Stems very numerous, from 4 to 10 inches high, branched, square, 
loosely spreading, and forming large tufts, conspicuous for their 
innumerable little milk-white flowers. The lower part of each 
stem is frequently rough with short prominent hairs, such as are 
scattered, often abundantly, over the lower leaves, but not 
pointing upwards or downwards, nor do they form a regular 
fringe on the margin ; the upper leaves are smoother. Some- 
times the whole herb is destitute of any such hairs. There are 
no hooked prickles on any part, though a few of the hairs, about 
the lower part of the margins of some leaves, are now and then 
slightly deflexed. The branches are opposite, mostly smooth. 
Leaves from 6 to 8 or 9 in a whorl, on the stem and main 
branches ; and indeed rarely fewer any where ; linear-lanceo- 
late, scarcely inclining to obovate, bright green, shining, revo- 
lute when dry, quite entire, tipped with a white liristle, most 
evident on the upper and smaller ones ; the lowest are much 
crowded. Flowers in copious, forked, smooth, minutely brac- 
tcateA panicles, terminating the stem and branches. Segments 
of the corolla acute, somewhat pointed. Style deeply cloven. 
Stigmas globose. Fruit small, of 2 globular seeds, quite' smooth. 

This is, in itself, a most distinct and well defined species, no other- 
wise variable than in the pube.^cence, which is of a very pecu- 
liar nature, at least among the smooth-seeded kinds ; consisting 
of short, soft, directly prominent, hairs, not attaching themselves 
to neighbouring substances, like the prickles of the foregoing 
species. Nothing however, as Haller remarks, is more difficult 
than the synonymy of this plant. Indeed most writers upon the 
present genus mention every thing but what is important or 
discriminative. Our plant is certainly that of Linnaeus ; but 
Haller, who in his first edition above quoted appears to have 
meant the same, has there collected synonyms which belong to 
the totally different G. glaucum. Under n. 717 of his 2nd edi- 
tion, he has given such a description as cannot be mistaken, 
though, according to Mr. Davall, he includes, under this number, 
G. austriacum of Jacquin ; and there can be no certainty of his 
references to older authors. I presume Mr. G. Don must have 
known G. pusillum, though Professor Hooker seems doubtful 
about it, and I therefore quote his work with hesitation. Our 
English plant could surely never have been, by any chance, 
called IcEve ; for if one specimen be smooth, it is always accom- 
panied by hundreds in every state of hairiness. G. pusillum of 
Villars, if correctly drawn, must be different. His species require 
an accurate scrutiny ; they are probably too many ; nor w.is 
he or his pupils invariably correct in the specimens of this diffi- 
cult tribe, which they sent named to their correspondents.

Annual. Jubj. 

Root small, fibrous. Stem 2 â€” 4 inches high, erect, round, slender, 
branched from the bottom, more or less forked. Leaves chiefly 
radical, lanceolate or spatulate, single-ribbed, not an inch long. 
FL small, yellow, erect, stalked, solitary at the end of each 
branch. 

The structure of the receptacles appears somewhat different from 
Mr. Brown's idea of what is strictly proper to Exacum; but, as 
Linnaeus observes, there are few genera in which some part or 
other of the fructification is not various, or liable to exceptions ; 
a principle very judiciously kept in view by our learned country- 
man in the following genus.

214 TETRANDRIAâ€” MONOGYNIA. Plantago. 

In meadows, pastures, waste and cultivated ground, common. 

Perennial. All Summer. 

Root of many long stout fibres. Stem none. Leaves numerous, 
broad, with 7 or 9 ribs, on channelled ribbed stalks, often longer 
than themselves ; the margins wavy, or variously toothed. Fl. 
small, whitish, with reddish anthers, very numerous; imbricated 
in the bud ; afterwards more distant ; composing several long 
spikes, each on a simple, naked, radical stalk. Caps, membranous, 
small, oval, pointed, with several angular seeds in each cell, 
which are the food of small birds. The rose-shaped variety, and 
the panicled one, are often kept in gardens, for the sake of 
curiosity, and afford remarkable instances of vegetable trans- 
formation. 

This species, like the whole genus in general, is mucilaginous and 
somewhat astringent ; qualities which render it a, not altogether 
useless, rustic medicine. 

2. P. media. Hoary Plantain.

In dry pastures, on chalky or gi'avelly hills, abundantly. 

Perennial. June â€” August. 

Root rather woody. Leaves all pressed close to the ground, hoary, 
entire, with 5 or 7 ribs. Flowerstalks taller than the foregoing, 
hoary. Spike shorter and thicker, very dense in every part. Cor. 
membranous and silvery in appearance, with shining, pink stn- 
mens, and whitish, pointed anthers. Seeds one in each cell, semi- 
cylindrical . 

The Hoary Plantain, a great and lasting nuisance in fine grass- 
plats, is best killed by a drop of vitriolic acid on the crown of 
the root, which it never long survives. Its medical qualities are 
like the former. 

3. P. lanceolata. Ribwort Plantain. 

Leaves lanceolate, entire, tapering at each end ; woolly at 
the base. Flowerstalks angular. Spike ovate.

Root ratlier woody. Leaves numerous, erect, deep green, acute, 
each taj^ering at the base into a broad, flat, ribbed footstalk, 
accompanied at its insertion with large tufts of soft, white, 
woolly fibres. Flowerstnlks taller than the leaves, likewise woolly 
at the base, five-angled, with intermediate furrows, nearly 
smooth, twisted. Spike an inch long, with black imbricated 
bracteas, and occasionally leafy at the base. Cor. pale. Anth. 
large, cream-coloured. The sj)ikes are liable to the very same 
transformations as in P. major. This species makes a part of 
most meadow hay, and has been cultivated as a crop, but seems 
to be now disused. Cattle are said not to eat it willingly, at 
least by itself.

Root long, cylindrical. Herb extremely various in luxuriance. 
Leaves numerous, all radical, spreading, fleshy, from 4 to 12 
inches long, linear, acute : channelled above ; convex beneath ; 
dull green, smooth, or somewhat hairy ; either quite entire, or 
frequently, in maritime situations, beset with a few distant, ir- 
regular teeth J more or less woolly at the base, but neither con- 
tracted there, nor stalked. Flowerstalks several, taller than tlie 
leaves, erect, or ascending, round and even, generally smooth. 
Spike long and slender, many-flowered, slightly tapering, dense, 
uninterrupted, with fleshy bluntly keeled bracteas, not longer 
than the calyx. Stigma undivided, not cloven. I have not seen 
the ripe capside. 

Some of the above figures, as those of Fl. Grtcc, Lobel, and one 
of Gerarde's, represent the haves with a few tcetli ; but that

circumstance is merely incidental, and does not mark even a 
distinct variety. Yet such specimens were mistaken by Hudson 
for P. Loeflingil, Linn. Sp. PL 166, owing to the figure of Peti- 
ver, above quoted, being erroneously cited by Linnseus. On the 
other hand, Ray himself took mountain specimens of our P. ma- 
Titima for an exotic species of Baiihin, the Plantain noirdtre, 
(P. nigricans) of Reynier's herbarium ; which Hallcr confounds 
with lanceolata, and which others liave referred as inaccurately 
to alpina. Dillenius, between brackets^ in the Synopsis, corrects 
Ray's mistake.

The unquestionable affinity of this genus to the natural class 
Icosandria of Linnagus, induces me to conform to Jussieu's 
ideas, so far as to take for a cali/x, what Linnaean botanists 
have hitherto called corolla. Yet even Jussieu candidly 
expresses his doubts in this case ; and I am well aware of 
the danger of allovdng metaphysical speculations, to inter- 
fere with common sense, in Botany or any other science. 
Whether the originally thin outer coat of the germen 
should be taken for the body or tube of the calyx, as in 
Rosa, may admit of a question. That and the I'est of the 
germen certainly become together a hardened pericarp), or 
capsule, which part in Rosa is pulpy. I have seen but 1 
seed, and 1 style in Sanguisorba, as represented by La- 
marck. Jussieu describes 2.

had scarcely an idea of its being more than a variety. Yet it is 
certainly the plant of the authors above quoted, and is found 
wild in Siberia, as well as in Canada. The stigma is globular, 
in numerous segments. But the shape of that part varies, in 
the present genus, according as it is more or less perfect.

twice or thrice ternate, leaf, whose fringed veiny leaflets, J -1- or 2 
inches long, hang perpendicularly, and increase in size after the 
Jiowers are past. From the point of insertion of their common 
footstalk, at the top of the stem, springs a branching cluster of 
very handsome and singular drooping Jiowers, whose dark -red 
petals are contrasted with the pale lemon-coloured nectaries, 
which are full of honey, and altogether peculiar. The French 
school deny them their proper appellation, because it was in- 
vented by Linnaeus, and he sometimes extended the term too 
far ; but this is no objection to its just application, as in this in- 
stance, the Orchis tribe, and others innumerable.

are agitated by the wind. No figure can do them justice. The 
upper surface is smooth and naked, of a fine green.

TETRANDRIAâ€” DIGYNIA. Buffonia. 225 

In sandy or gravelly fields, especially when fallow, as well as on 
heathy banks. 

Annual. May â€” October. 

Root small, fibrous. Stems numerous, about a finger's length, 
spreading or prostrate, round, leafy, hardly subdivided. Leaves 
alternate, variously cut, on short 'stalks, with large deeply cut 
sfipulas. Fl. green, in axillary, hairy tufts, still shorter than the 
footstalks. The whole plant is more or less hairy, and in fla- 
vour and scent approaches its natural ally, Burnet. Like most 
other plants which have obtained an empirical reputation for 
calculous complaints, it is astringent, and perhaps slightly mu- 
cilaginous. 

The stamens, generally 4, are often solitary. In other respects it 
is altogether an Akhemilla ; and, like A. vulgaris, has often 2 
pistils.

Found by Plukenet about Boston, Lincolnshire. Pluk.Almag. On 
Hounslow heath, by Mr. Doody. Dill, in Ray's Synopsis. No 
other botanist has met with this plant on Hounslow heath ; and 
the late Sir Joseph Banks, who often examined the coast near 
Boston, was persuaded that Bupleurum tenuissimum had been 
mistaken for the Buffonia. Yet Plukenet and Dillenius cer- 
tainly knew the latter perfectly, and the original specimen in 
the British Museum is right. 

Annual. June. 

Root slender, fibrous. Stem smooth, round, alternately branched, 
a span high. Leaves awl-shaped, 3-ribbed, smooth, combined 
by their broad sheathing bases, which are minutely fringed. Fl. 
small, white, solitary, erect, on terminal or axillary roughish 
stalks. Leaves of the calyx each with 3 close ribs, and broad 
membranous margins. 

Sauvages named this genus after his great countryman Buffon, 
who had indeed very slender pretensions to a botanical honour j 
a circumstance supposed to have been indicated by Linnaeus in 
the specific name, temiifolia.

Tree. May. 

A handsome evergreen tree, of slow growth, with a smooth grey 
bark, which, abounding with mucilage, makes bird-lime, by ma- 
ceration in water. The wood is hard, and close-grained. Leaves 
alternate, stalked, rigid, shining, wavy, with spinous divaricated 
lobes ; the ujjper ones on old trees, entire, with only a terminal 
prickle. Fl. copious, white, tinged externally with purple ; the 
earlier ones least perfect. Berries scarlet ; casually yellow. 
Numerous variegated varieties are kept in gardens, and one 
whose leaves are prickly on the disk. The tree bears clipping 
well, but is not so fashionable for cut hedges as formerly. The 
branches, laden with berries, are stuck about rustic kitchens and 
churches at Christmas, and remain till Candlemas day. In 
Norfolk the Misseltoe accompanies them, and sometimes the 
Euonymus. The Druids are said to have introduced this custom 
for the accommodation of certain sylvan spirits, of a chilly con- 
stitution, while the oaks were leafless. Agreeable associations, 
connected with returning seasons, keep up such practices long 
after their original meaning is forgotten.

Perennial. July, August. 

Whole plant immersed in the water, except the spikes, which con- 
sist of a few brown flowers, with copious white pollen. Their 
stalks are rather tumid in the upper part. Leaves all sessile, 
1^ or 2 inches long, uniform, olive-coloured, pellucid like oiled 
paper, as Haller remarks ; harsh to the touch, but brittle ; their 
ribs reddish. Seeds compressed, shining. Stipulas tight and 
close. 

Haller esteems Loesel's plant a distinct species, and it is his own 
n. 844. Dillenius has introduced it into Ray's Synopsis, next 
to P. perfoliatum. The leaves are said by Haller to be firm {dura) 
like those of the first ; but he had seen only a dry specimen col- 
lected near Berne, without^ou;ers, and the plant was never ob- 
served afterwards.

Smaller than the last, and of a much brighter green. All the leaves 
are under water, somewhat recurved, an inch or inch and half 
long, very near together. Flowerstalks solitary, from the forks 
of the stem, each bearing a small quadrangular head of 4 green 
flowers, well compared, by Clusius and Goodyer, to the flowers 
of Adoxa Moschatellina. 'This head is just out of the water du- 
ring impregnation ; after which, by the increase of the branches, 
it sinks, and ripens seed, whilst other flowers come forth above.

Perennial. July, August. 

As large as the first species, with which it agrees in having the 
upper leaves floating, and coilsiderably coriaceous; but it is 
really more akin to lucens, from which Haller had much diffi- 
culty to distinguish our plant. He speaks of it as very com- 
mon in Switzerland, and I have many specimens from the late 
Mr. Davall. J. Bauhin's figure agrees far better with this than 
with the following, to which his synonym has always been re- 
ferred. The stem is 5 or 6 feet long. Whole plant nearly im- 
mersed, a few of the uppermost leaves only being more or less 
floating, during the flowering season at least. These are firm 
and coriaceous, though less so than in P. nutans, elliptic-oblong, 
bluntish j tapering at the base into foot-stalks, extremely various 
in length. Stipulas sheathing. Flower-stalks axillary, solitary, 
from various parts of the stem, slightly swelling upwards. Spikes 
above an inch long, cylindrical, dense. The lower leaves are 
sessile, occasionally somewhat stalked, lanceolate, mostly acute. 
The ribs of all the leaves are distinct and separate from the very 
bottom , by which this species essentially differs from the follow- 
ing. AH parts of the plant, especially the upper leaves, and 
Jlowers, are tinged with a reddish hue, permanent in dried spe- 
cimens, and resembling P. coloraium, Fl. Dan. t. 1449, what- 
ever that may be. 

6. P. lucens. Shining Pond-weed.

long, all nearly alike, more or less acute, tipped with a small 
point ; their colour olive green, now and then reddish in the 
upper ones ; their base usually tapering into the footstalk, some- 
times rounded ; their margins more or less undulated, becoming 
plaited when pressed, and the edge is rough, or veiy finely cre- 
nate, but this last character varies. What is most characteristic 
is the strong network, formed by the numerous transverse veins, 
connecting the 5 or 7 longitudinal ribs : and especially the union 
of the side ribs to the middle one, a considerable way above the 
base of the leaf. Thejlowerstalk swells towards the top. Spike 
2 inches long, of very numerous, crowded, green flowers. 
Petiver's figure is justly commended by Haller ; but the latter quotes 
P. serratum of Linnaeus very erroneously. Plukenet's definition, 
of which Dillenius could make nothing, answers very well to 
some of my specimens.

Perennial. July, August. 

The whole plant, not a quarter the size of the preceding, floats 
under water, the flowers always excepted, and is of a brownish 
olive-colour. Leaves sessile, alternate except under each flower- 
stalk, hardly 2 inches long, bluntish, even, entire, distinguished 
by several series of beautiful, oblong, chain-like reticulations, 
close to each side of the main rib. These unfortunately are not 
expressed in Engl. Bot. Stipulas narrow, lanceolate, acute. 
Floioer-stalks solitary, from the bosom of one stipula of the op- 
posite leaves, shorter than the leaves, rather stout, each bearing 
a small, short, dense spike, of 8 â€” 12 little brown ish^owers. 

This species certainly answers to the definition of the hitherto un- 
determined P. setaceum of Linnaeus and of Hudson ; but nothing 
can be absolutely affirmed on this subject, nor does the name 
well agree. Some may be inclined to refer to P. lanceolatum, 
the No. IG of Dill, in Raii Syii. 150, quoted above under hete- 
rophijllum. I have only conjectures to ofler, which some au-

Whole plant under water, bright green. Leaves sessile, or nearly 
so, 2 inches long, bluntish, elegantly crisped at the edges, and 
more or less undulated ; furnished with slight reticulations next 
the rib, far less remarkable than the last. The lower leaves are 
usually alternate ; upper ones often opposite. Fl. yellowish 
green, with elongated reddish styles, in short loose spikes. Hud- 
son's P. serratum is acknowledged by himself to be too near 
crispum, of which it is doubtless a variety with more of the leaves 
opposite, and all perhaps less undulated ; as in Clusius's figure, 
annexed by Johnson, in Gerarde, to a description belonging to 
P. densum.

or 3 inches long, and 1 -8th of an inch broad, rounded at the 
end, with a minute, often scarcely perceptible, point. The mid- 
rib becomes cellular, or vascular, in the upper leaves, as if com- 
posed of oblong reticulations, in some degree resembling P. lan- 
ceolatuni. Whether this appearance be owing to air-vessels, 
produced in the flowering season, to render the plant buoyant, 
we can but conjecture. At each side are 2 equidistant, parallel, 
very fine ribs, of which the inner pair only are continued till they 
form an arch just below the termination of the leaf. Stipulas 
pale, partly cloven, embracing the stem. Flowers brownish, 4 
or more in each small loose spike, just rising out of the water, 
terminal till the branch rises above them.

Larger than the last, with which it has, in England, always been 
confounded. Professor Schrader has communicated it to me as 
the P. cuspidatum of his H. Germ., the 2d vol. of which, if pub- 
lished, has not yet reached us, and 1 have sought out such cha- 
racters as my specimens afford. The principal one is indicated 
in the name. The leaves are not rounded at the end, but taper 
off rather suddenly and obliquely, into a terminal point, formed 
of the substance of the leaf. There are, moreover, only 2 lateral 
ribs, 1 at each side, half way between the mid-rib and the mar- 
gin. These are often very inconspicuous ) but there are nume- 
rous intermediate ribs, all over the leaf, which do not occur in 
P. compressum. Both the lateral as well as all the intermediate 
ribs keep distinct, and vanish just below the extremity of the 
leaf. These characters, though not the intermediate ribs, are 
clearly expressed in Loesel's figure, which has hitherto been 
quoted for P. compressum, as has likewise Haller's n. 85 1 . But 
his character of the lanceolate leaves long ago caused the accu- 
rate Mr. Davall to suspect an error in that reference. This cha- 
racter indeed agrees admirably with specimens in the Linnsean 
herbarium, of a plant erroneously taken for compressum, but 
which I am told the late Professor Willdenow has somewliere 
named complanatum. \i% Jlower-stalks are near a foot long ; 
/eaics 5 -ribbed, l-3d of an inch broad, tapering at each end. 
This is very possibly Holler's w. 851.

Herb submersed. Stem slender, thread-shaped, wavy, much branch- 
ed, forked in the upper part. Leaves grassy, alternate, except 
at the forks, crowded, spreading, 3 inches long, of a fine green, 
linear, though gradually contracted toward the base, bbantish, 
with an occasional small short point. Their mid-rib is aOre or 
less accompanied by very narrow, oblong, parallel reticuffitions j 
side ribs solitary, nearer to the margin than to the mid-rib, e.\- 
tremely fine, and sometimes scarcely discernible, vanishing at a 
greater or less distance below the point. There are no inter- 
mediate ribs. Stipukts pale, usually convoluted, so as to be nar- 
rower than their leaves. Stalks from the forks of the stem, per- 
haps without exception ; the remark to the contrary, in some 
instances, being founded on a specimen of P. cuspidatum, mis- 
taken by Linnaeus. Spikes ovate, dense, generally quite as long 
as their stalks, just raised above the water. Seeds almost globu- 
lar, with an oblique point. 

The riljs of the leaves in this and the two preceding species will 
always clearly ascertain them. They have indeed puzzled bota- 
nists who have seen them only superficially, or not at all j but 
they are not the less distinct on that account.

Much smaller than any of the foregoing. Stem slender, round, 
more or less branched, from 1 to 2 feet long, altogether sub- 
mersed, the flowers only appearing above-water. Leaves 1^ or 
2 inches long, scarcely a line in breadth, opposite under every 
flower-stalk, otherwise alternate, rather acute ; their mid-rib 
slightly accompanied by oblong reticulations ; lateral ribs to- 
wards the margins, solitary, very slender, and often hardly visi- 
ble ; if continued far enough, joining the mid-rib, at some di- 
stance below the point, and not quite both together. Stipulas 
sheathing, broader than the leaves. Flower-stalks lateral, axil- 
lary; the uppermost sometimes surmounted by a pair of branches; 
all much longer than the small, ovate spike, which consists of 
but hw Jlowers, becoming a little distant as the fruit advances. 
Seeds ovate, obliquely beaked. 

A perfectly clear and well-known species, though Willdenow has 
misquoted Haller, and Haller the Fl. Dan. A variety somewhat 
larger than common, but not otherwise different, was found by 
Mr. Teesdale, near Beverley, which I have from Switzerland for 
compressum, and it is also marked Haller's 7i. 851 ; a combina- 
tion of errors, for which the accurate Mr. Davall is not respon- 
sible, for he had studied this genus correctly.

the stipula, whose cloven summit vises a little above the sheath, 
as in grasses. Spikes few, solitary, each from one of the upper- 
most forks of the branches, on a longish stalk, cylindrical, with 
considerable interruptions, rising jnst above the surface, seldom 
produced but in still waters. Fl. 2 or 3 together, dull green. 
.Seeds scarcely more than 1 or 2 from each flower, gibbous. 
Few plants vary more in the size of its herbage, vvhich is most 
considerable in rapid streams, where the flowers seldom appear. 
Dillenius says the leaves are most slender, and the heads of 
jiowers largest, in salt-water ditches j but this is disproved by 
observation in England, and by Swiss specimens, all from fresh 
water, as various as any j so that P. marinum cannot be marked 
even as a variety.

Habit of Potamogeton, from which it differs in the want of 
a corolla, in the posture as well as shape of the anthers., 
and in the stalked seeds. But Linnaeus surely errs in using 
the term spadix here, for what the former genus shows 
to be ajlower-stalk. Impregnation in Ruppia takes place 
within the sheath of the leaf, and the seeds are subse- 
quently raised above the water to ripen ; just the reverse 
of Potamo"eton.

Perennial ? August, September. 

Herb submersed. Roofs fibrous, in tufts, from several of the lower 
joints of the long, slender, round, much branched, leafy stem. 
Leaves alternate, linear, extremely narrow, more or less acute, 
channelled, single-ribbed from about the middle upward, entire; 
dotted with brown or purple towards the edges ; clasping the 
stem with their sheathing, somewhat dilated, base. Spikes usually 
2-fiowered, on short, solitary, axillary stalks. Fl. alternate, ver- 
tical, as distinct on their common stalk as those of any Fotamo- 
geton, and inclosed within the sheath of the neighbouring leaf, 
as it appears, till impregnation is accomplished ; my account in 
Engl. Bot. being, in this particular, incorrect. Professor Hooker 
has rightly explained the process. After flowering, the flower- 
stalk, often spiral, is greatly lengthened, rising to the surface of 
the water, and carrying with it the 4 impregnated germens, each 
raised on its own long and firm stalk, produced likewise after 

. the ani/ters are fallen. Each germen becomes an ovate, pointed 
seed, the size of Millet, with a hard shell, that does not burst. 
Dr. Hooker has admirably illustrated the history of this curious 
plant, and has named the parts of the seed so as, surely, to 
leave no room for any improvement. The germination of the 
plant, when properly investigated, must show which is the real 
plumula.

leafy, round, smooth, often purplish. Leaves scarcely half the 
length of the former species, but broader in proportion, thick 
and blunt, often tipped with a minute point, but no bristle ; com- 
bined by their membranous bases, and sometimes fringed there- 
abouts. Flower-stalks slender, erect, smooth, usually an inch 
long. Calyx-leaves broadly ovate, obtuse, with a white mem-

The whole plant is more slender than either of the foregoing. Stems 
numerous, partly reclining but not taking root, more or less 
hairy, or rough with prominent scattered points. Leaves sha^ied 
like those of .S'. procumbens, but fringed at the edges, each tipped 
with a very distinct bristle ; and they are not unfrequently hairy 
all over. Flower-stalks long and slender, and likewise hairy. 
Flowers not perhaps so truly apetalous as the last, though often 
perfectly so. The petals, if present, are white, not half the 
length of the calyx, either entire or notched. Caps, pale, about 
twice as long as the calyx. Seeds bordered with a black line ; 
but this, as in Spergula and Arenaria, is variable.

An elegant -little plant, certainly misplaced in Sagina, as its habit

its genus is hinted, in Fl. Brit, and Engl. Bot. ; though I had not 
then seen Ehrhart's work, to consider his characters. The ori-

with a tinge of red. The whole plant is smooth, so small and 
depressed that it only becomes remarkable by the ample reddish

are naturally 3-cleft, and of course triandrous ; but they are 
sometimes 4-cleft in strong plants, and Gsertner says 5-cleft. 
Still the want of nectaries keeps them generically distinct from

following genera, the same. See Gyavimar 102. 

[Professor Schrader, in a small treatise on the Asperifoli^e, 
gives their natural characters as follows : 

Moot simple or branched, perpendicular, sometimes oblique, 
very rarely creeping. Siem herbaceous, rarely shrubby; 
branches alternate, axillary. Leaves for the most part 
alternate, entire, sometimes wavy, or broadly toothed, 
more or less bristly, like the rest of the herb ; their bristles 
proceeding each from a small prominence finally be- 
coming callous; very rarely seated on a tubercle. Flowers 
alternate, with or without bracteas, mostly forming a uni- 
lateral duster, at first spirally revolute, afterwards elon- 
gated; the partial stalks enlarged as the seeds ripen. 
Bracteas, if present, solitary, generally lateral, more or 
less leafy, permanent. Calyx, except in Cerinthe, of 1 leaf, 
more or less deej^ly 5-cleft, very seldom merely 5 -toothed; 
the segments or teeth generally a little unequal ; perma- 
nent, enlarged after flowering, and in some instances 
altered in shape. Corolla inferior, of 1 petal, 5-cleft, the 
segments mostly equal ; the mouth either completely, or 
imperfectly, closed with convex hollow valves ; or beset 
with swellings, or plaits, or dense hairs; or entirely naked 
and pervious. Stamens from the interior part of the tube, 
seldom from the mouth, alternate with the segments of 
the limb, and equal to them in number; anthers of 2 
cells, distinct, very seldom attached to each other. Ger- 
mens 4, very rarely (in Cerinthe) 2 only, distinct, seated 
on a fleshy or glandular receptacle, subsequently enlarged, 
and supporting the ripe fruit. Style 1, from the disk be- 
tween the germens, permanent; and terminating in a 
generally undivided stigma. Fruit as many close capsules 
{achenia) as there are germens, various in substance, each 
furnished, in some instances, with an umbilical depression, 
from which proceeds the strophiolum, or crest, hardly oc- 
curring but where that depression exists, and which is 
whitish and flesh}-, occupying the whole cavity ; but be- 



248 PENTANDRIAâ€” MONOGYNIA. Myosotis. 

comes contracted and wrinkled as the fruit ripens, so as 
to render the depression more visible. Seed solitary in 
each capsule, with a single sJcin, and no albumen; embryo 
inverted ; cotyledons 2, slightly convex ; radicle superior. 
Receptacle mostly unaltered, and flat ; in some convex ; 
in some conical; in others columnar, or pyramidal; 
marked with scars, or little hollows, where the capsules 
are attached. Schrad. Aspei-if. 1 7. 

I rather, after the example of Linnaeus, consider these sup- 
posed achenia as naked seeds ; nor is there any advantage 
in denominating them, after Gaertner and some other 
writers, nuts, which in that case would merely mean hard 
seeds. The kernel within having but a single skin, mem- 
brana ; and the near relationship of this Order to the 
Verticillutie of Ray and Linnteus, the Labiatce of Jussieu, 
being acknowledged, analogy, thoiigli often a treacherous 
guide, must lead us to consider the second covering as 
the outer shin, testa, in one case as well as the other. In 
the VerticillatiE there can be no question about the mat- 
ter, if naked seeds be ever allowed to exist ; and to deny 
this is merely a dispute of words. In the AsperiJbUcc, the 
outer sJcin is often indeed elaborately constructed ; and 
sometimes downy, or pi'ickly; but such characters are 
not more appropriate or essential to a seed-vessel than to 
a seed. The seeds of Cerinthe, which at first sight seem a 
difficulty less easy to be surmounted, are merely confluent, 
or combined laterally, in pairs, like the nuts of Messer^ 
schmidia, which last are the seeds of a drupa, the only ge-s 
jjuine nuts, of which a Walnut is the type.] 

Myosotis. 

Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf, oblong, erect, divided half way down, 
or more, into 5 acute equal segments, permanent. Cor. 
of one petal, salver-shaped; tube cyhndrical; hmb ascend- 
ing, or horizontal, in 5, rather deep, obtuse, often notched, 
equal segments ; mouth half closed with 5 little, rounded, 
notched, convex, slightly prominent valves. Filam. very 
short, in the throat. Anthers small, oblong, concealed 
by the valves. Germens 4, roundish, inserted into the 
base of the calyx. Style thread-shaped, central, erect, 
the length of the tube. Stigma obtuse. Seeds 4, ovate, 
rather compressed, pointed, smooth, in the bottom of the 
somewhat enlarged, closed calyx, each with a small hollow 
at its point of insertion.

Roots very long, creeping, blackish, with numerous tufts of strong 
fibres, i/ert bright green, rather succulent, from 6 to 12 or J 8 
inches high. Stems ascending obliquely, round, branching, leafy, 
either nearly smooth, or clothed with, more or less spreading, 
bristly hairs. Leaves sessile, nearly uniform, elliptic-oblong, 
bluntish, 1^ or 2 inches long, clothed on boih sides with small 
close-pressed bristles, which scarcely render them rough to the 
sight or the touch. Clusters many-flowered, 2 or 3 together, on 
a terminal leafless stalk, or elongation of each branch ; each 
general and partial stalk, as well as both sides of the calyx, being 
clothed with erect, or close-pressed, short, straight, simple, rigid, 
pale, uniform, bristly hairs. Partial stalks at first crowded into 
a dense revolute spike, which unrolls gradually, and, after flower- 
ing, is greatly elongated, the stalks spreading almost horizontally 
as the seeds ripen, forming a very lax straight cluster. Calyv 
about half the length of each partial stalk, after the flower is 
past ; bell-shaped at the base ; the limb divided half way down 
into 5 broad, triangular, rather expanding, segments. Tube of 
the corolla about as long as the calyx, whitisfi ; limb longer.

This most elegant plant, the Forget-me-not, or emblem of affec- 
tion, among the Germans, is the most distinct, and best known, . 
example of its genus, though too long confounded with other 
common species. The perennial creeping roots, shining green 
herbage, and enamelled blossoms, are all strikingly characteristic. 
Linnaeus records its being hurtful to sheep ; which, like a similar 
report of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, may have arisen from those ani- 
. mals suffering from frequenting the wet situations of these plants. 

2. M. ccE^pitosa. Tufted Water Scorpion -grass.

Root fibrous, or slightly creeping. Stems numerous, a foot high> 
crowded, erect,rauch branched, leafy and many -flowered. Whole

always a leaf or two at the base of each duster. The Jiowers are 
smaller, paler, and far less conspicuous. Calyx rather more 
deeply 5 -cleft, with fewer, more dispersed and lax, bristles. 
Seeds like the last. The plant remains unchanged by cultiva-

Root long and creeping. Herb of a dull green, copiously clothed 
with lax spreading hairs, sometimes minutely callous at their 
origin. Stems several, very hairy, leafy, more or less branched, 
from 4 to 10 inches high ; procumbent at the lower part. Leaves 
oblong ; the lowermost often obovate, and tapering at the base. 
Clusters in pairs or solitary, on terminal, leafless, upright stalks. 
Hairs on the general and partial stalks erect, but not close- 
pressed. Partial stalks when in fruit longer than the calyx, 
spreading not quite horizontally. Cali/x bell-shaped in the lower 
half, and plentifully clothed with spreading, partly brownish, 
hooked bristles ; in the upper half deeply 5 -cleft, the lanceolate 
converging segments covered with straight, erect, silvery hairs. 
Cor. bright blue, almost equal in size and beauty to that of

Root fibrous, branching at the summit. Stems one or more, erect, 
12 or 18 inches high, branched at the upper part, leafy, angular, 
clothed with soft spreading hairs. Leaves oblong, obtuse, clothed 
and fringed with similar hairs, slightly callous at their base ; the 
lowermost obovate, each tapering into a footstalk. Clusters 
terminal, mostly solitary, very long and straight when in fruit, 
each with a sessile, ovate, acute leaf, at the base of its stalk. 
Partial stalks moderately spreading, somewhat longer than the 
calyx, and clothed, like the common stalks, with short, upright 
or incurved, hairs. Tube of the calyx bell-shaped, densely 
clothed with fine, spreading, hooked bristles ; limb longer than 
the tube, in 5 deep, unequal, lanceolate segments, rough with 
erect, straight, brownish-tipped hairs. Corolla bright blue ; 
limb horizontal, in .j obovate, flat segments, longer than the 
pale tube. The Ji>owers vary a little in size, and yield in beauty 
to those of M. paliistris. Tab. .583 of the Flora Danica is, as 
Dr.Lehmann observes, not a good figure of this species, being un- 
questionablyi I think, drawn from the preceding, which escaped

Boot fibrous, or slightly creeping, blackish. Stems several, from 
3 to 5 inches high, erect, simple, roundish, leafy, clothed with 
spreading hairs. Leaues ovate-oblong ; the upper ones rather 
pointed ; radical ones elliptical, on linear smooth footstalks, 
twice or thrice their own length. Clusters either terminal, in 
pairs, on a leafless stalk, with a solitary flower at the fork, or 
axillary and solitary; all dense and revolute when in flower, 
subsequently elongated ; their stalks all clothed with erect or 
close short silky hairs. Calyx in 5 deep, unequal, linear -lanceo- 
late segments, covered with similar upright hairs, those on the 
very short tube only being slightly curved. Flowers blue, full as 
large and ornamental as in M. paluslris, pale pink in the bud, 
their horizontal limb much longer than th^ very short tube ; 
valves white. 

I have this from M. Villars as his alpine variety of M. scorpioides. 
Haller, by his reference to Barrelier, seems to confound it with 
the palustris, from which none can be more distinct.

Annual. June â€” August. 

Root fibrous, generally simple at the crown, always annual. Stem 
from 3 to 8 inches high, erect, branched and spreading from the 
base, roundish, slender, leafy, clothed with partly spreading 
hairs. Leaves covered with similar hairs ; the lowermost stalked, 
obovate ; the rest sessile, more or less obtuse. Clusters many- 
flowered ; at first small, dense, and revolute ; but very much 
elongated, and quite erect, when in fruit ; almost always distin- 
guished, as Mr. Borrer first remarked, by having one distant 
drooping flower-stalk situated in the bosom of the uppermost 
leaf. Sometimes there are more solitary flowers, or a small 
cluster or two, so situated. Partial stalks, when in fruit, spread- 
ing, covered with close hairs, and much longer than the calyx ; 
of which the tube is bell-shaped, clothed with spreading or de- 
flexed, hooked, bristly hairs ; the segments lanceolate, as long 
as the tube, their hairs erect. Corolla with a white tube, as 
long as the limb, which is small, bright blue, scarcely reddish in 
the bud; its valves sunk in the tube. iSeerfs ovate, obtuse, keeled, 
of a shining brown. The smaller j?ou,'ers, and annual ?-oof, di- 
stinguish this species from all the foregoing. The wooden cuts 
of old authors do not precisely represent it, the artists probably 
having M. sylvatica and intermedia in view at the same time, 
though they distinguished M. palustris.

Lehmann have observed. Leaves rather narrower than in M. ar- 
vensis. Clusters elevated, either single or in pairs, on long, 
terminal, leafless stalks, unattended by a solitary distant flower. 
Partial stalks, even when in fruit, not half the length of the 
calyx, which resembles that of the foregoing, but its hairs are 
shorter, and less deflexed. Corolla small ; limb shorter than 
the tube, blue in the lower half of each cluster, yellow in the 
upper ; and Dr. Lehmann has determined these colours to be 
immutable in the several flowers. In some instances the flowers 
are by him said to be larger, and all yellow, in others all blue ; 
the stigma in the former being somewhat capitate, in the latter 
slightly cloven. These last particulars have not been noticed 
in England. They seem to indicate a specific difference. Ca- 
vanilles may possibly have taken part of his description from 
M. apula of Linnaeus, whose synonyms he has applied to our 
plant, copying them, as appears by his erroneous reference to 
Lobel, without looking at the books, a practice which cannot be 
too much reprobated.

Root fleshy, tapering. Whole herb remarkable for its beautiful 
glaucous hue ; though the late Mr. J. Mackay met with speci- 
mens of a grass green, on the coast of Inverness. Stems seve- 
ral, entirely procumbent, a foot or more in length, alternately 
branched, leafy, smooth. Leaves rather fleshy, ovate, with a re- 
curved point, a solitaiy midrib, and a few obsolete transverse 
veins j the base contracted into a broad footstalk â€¢ both sides 
more or less besprinkled with callous points, but, like every 
other part of the plant, destitute of hairs or bristles. Flowers in 
terminal leafy clusters, with some solitary axillary ones here and 
there. Segments of the calyx deep and broad. Cnr. twice as 
long, fine purple ; the limb but little expanded, witli 5 swell- 
ings at its base, slightly overtopped by the stamens. Stigma 
capitate, small. Seeds large, ovate, pointed, keeled, closely 
converging, even, but not highly polished. 

By the synonyms it appears how differently botanists have, at all 
times, thought concerning the genus of this plant, whose beauty 
all have joined in celebrating. That it is a veiy bad Pulmonaria 
I have long ago pointed out in Engl. Bot. The habit agrees with 
Cerinthe, but not the powers or seeds. Dr. Lehmann and Pro- 
fessor Hooker have, well enough, removed it to Litliospermiun. 
When fresh, the leaves have a flavour resembling oysters, far 
from agreeable. The herb turns blackish in drying, which Dil- 
lenius says may be prevented by immersion for a night in fresh 
water.

This has been reckoned one of the four cordial flowers, and as such 
has come into medical use, along with Borage ; but virtues of 
this kind attributed to either are truly nonsensical. Both plants 
are mucilaginous, but the Mallow tribe is more so. Dr. Wither- 
ing confounds the history of this Anchusa with that of the true 
red Alkanet-root, A. tinctoria, Fl. Grcec. t. 166, valuable for the 
beautiful colour it gives to oily substances, and which Linnaeus 
confounds with his own Lithospermum tinctorium.

Root thick, mucilaginous ; externally black. Herb rough with ra- 
ther rigid hairs. Stems 18 inches high, round, leafy, annual. 
Radical leaves stalked, a span long, lasting through the winter; 
the rest sessile ; all ovate, broad, with transverse veins. Par- 
tial bracteas lanceolate. Flowers more salver-shaped than most 
of the genus ; the tube but half as long as the limb, which is of 
a most brilliant sky-blue ; the valves white and downy. The 
Jlower-buds are reddish. Seeds ovate, brown, compressed, with 
elevated wrinkles. Lehmann remarks that the cavity, or perfo- 
ration, at the base of each seed is closed with a scale.

Undoubtedly distinct from the common species, in its bright shining 
green colour, and want of downy softness, besides having 
scarcely any scent. The leaves are smooth on the upper side, 
except from the prominence of the callous warts of the under 
surface when pressed ; the latter being rough to the touch, and 
more or less hairy. Flowers at first opening reddish ; subse- 
quently of a dull blue. The Stem-leaves have a few short paral-

a span in length, tapering at each end, seldom spotted. The 
limb of the corolla is shorter, with rounder segments. Calyx, 
when in fruit, bell-shaped, and much dilated in width, without 
prominent angles, its stalk bent downwards, which seems not to 
be the case with P. officinalis. Seeds large, black, downy.

wrinkled and warty, of a light shining brown. The whole plant 
has an odour approaching to Cucumber and Burnet, which gives 
a flavour to a cool tankard ; but its supposed exhilarating qua-

Biennial. June, July. 

Whole herb very rough with prickly bristles arising from callous 
points, intermixed with smaller hairs. Stems one or more, 1 
to 2 feet high, erect or spreading, simple, round, leafy. Leaves 
alternate, lanceolate, single-ribbed, entire, dull green, tapering 
at the base ; the lowest stalked. Clusters terminal, leafy, com- 
posed of numerous, axillary, stalked pairs of dense, reflexed, 
hairy spikes, each of numerous, crowded, large, beautiful^owers ; 
pink in the bud, then blue or purple, occasionally white. As 
the seeds ripen, each spike becomes a spreading lax cluster, lilie 
the figures indicated under our variety /3, all which seem to re- 
))resent either the E. vulgare at an advanced period, or in a 
dwarf and starved state. Yet some of these figures having been

adopted by Linnaeus (through C. Bauhin) for his E. italicum, 
and he having thence been led to mark that species as a native 
of England, it has been received into all our Floras, and pub- 
lished by Mr. Dickson in his Hort. Sicc.fasc, 14. 18, and also in 
Engl. Bot. D. 29. <. 1 08 1 , from garden specimens, for the Lycopsis 
of Ray, found plentifully, as he reports, in Jersey. The Jersey 
plant however, as far as I have been able to learn, has blue 
Jlowers 5 whereas E. italicum is alwaj'S white. Ray cites the 
figure of Dodonaeus, which is from the very same block with 
Lobel's and Gerarde's, as a good representation of his plant. 
Our E. vulgare may frequently be found very nearly aUvSwering 
to this figure, nor have I ever been able to detect a second 
species in England, whatever may be found in Jersey ; on which 
subject some authentic information, by means of specimens or 
seeds, is very desirable. Possibly E. plantaginenm, Fl. Grcec. 
t. 179, having lateral ribs to its leaves, like the above wooden 
cut, may be the plant of Ray and Dodoneeus,

[There appears little reason for Ventenat's change of the 
original name of this order to Primulaccce. Mr. Brown, 
who adopts the latter, adds the following characters to 
those of Jussieu, given m the Grammar. 

Calyx in 5, rarely 4, segments, regular, permanent. Corolla 
regular; limb in 5, rarely 4, divisions. Stigma capitate. 
Capsule with parallel, not imbricated or inflexed, valves. 
Seeds peltate, furnished with albumen, in which is lodged 
the embryo, parallel to the scar ; radicle indeterminate in 
direction. Herbs, with mostly opposite, sometimes whorl- 
ed, sometimes scattered, leaves. See the characters of the 
Le7itibula7-i(Z, an order separated from this, p. 27.] 

Primula. 
Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf, tubular, with 5 angles and 5 teeth, regu-

cylindrical, as long as the calyx, or longer; limb spreading, 
in 5, rather deep, inversely heart-shaped, obtuse segments ; 
throat concave, hemispherical, pervious. Filam. in the 
throat, very short, opposite to the segments of the limb. 
Anth. pointed, erect, converging, not prominent. Germ. 
globular. Style thread-shaped, the length of the calyx.

Root somewhat fleshy, with long fibres. Leaves numerous, radi- 
cal, obovate-oblong, unequally toothed, soft and somewhat 
downy, reticulated with veins ; tapering gradually downward 
into broad short footstalks. Fl. numerous, large, sulphur- 
coloured, with a darker radiating spot in the middle ; their scent 
agreeable, though slight. Sometimes the Jlower-stalks form an 
umbel, being elevated on a common stalk, as tall as the leaves, 
a few remaining single from the root ; but this variety, my /3, is 
distinct from P. elatior. I have such a specimen from the Rev. 
Mr. Relhan. There is always an awl -shaped bractea at the base 
of each particular stalk, whether radical or umbellate. 

There are cultivated varieties, white, purplish, or brown, single or 
double, of which the double sulphur-coloured is peculiarly 
elegant.

Leaves contracted, or sinuated, about the middle, in which respect 
this species differs from the preceding, and more agrees with the 
following. Thejlowers are sweet-scented, all umbellate, smaller, 
M'ith a less expanded limb, than in the former, or its varieties ; 
but larger, paler coloured, and less cup-shaped, than in the Cov/- 
slip. It has often been supposed a mule between these two most 
common species ; and having often, perhaps, been confounded 
with the umbellate variety of the Primrose, its history and true 
nature have become the more obscure.

In meadows and pastures, chiefly on a clay, or chalky, soil. 

Perennial. April, May. 

Leaves hoary, more finely downy and soft than in either of the 
foregoing, contracted in the middle, so as frequently to become 
heart-shaped, as it were, with winged footstalks ; their margin 
wavy, as well as toothed. Flowers numerous, in one or more 
umbels, with small partial bracteas, on downy common stalks 
much taller than the leaves. Cal. downy. Limb of the corolla 
much smaller than the last, concave, or cup-shaped ; of a deeper 
yellow on the upper side, with 5 orange spots, or freckles, in 
which Shakspear has supposed their sweet odour to reside. 
These flowers make a pleasant soporific vvine, resembling that 
of Elder-flowers, or the Muscat wines of the south of France. 

A dark- flowered variety, called the Black Cowslip, has been sent 
from Bedfordshire, by the late Rev. Dr. Abbot, vvith the calyx 
divided to the base ; and from Northumberland, by Mr. Winch, 
with the same part unaltered.

Half the size of the last ; distinguished by the white mealiness of 
thejlower-stalks and backs of the leaves, whose upper sides are 
green, smooth, and even ; as well as by the beautiful rose-co- 
loured^owers, whose mouth is surrounded with a notched yellow 
glandular border, which caused Haller to make this plant an 
Aretia, such glands forming one of the chief characters of that 
genus. They are however more remarkable and converging in 
its genuine species.

Found by Mr. Gibb of Inverness, on Holborn Head, near Thurso 
in Caithness, abundantly, also in the way from Tliurso to Dun- 
beath. Hooker. 

Perennial. July. 

Akin to P. farinosa, but the mealiness is said to be yellower, ex- 
isting, more or less, on both surfaces of the leaves. Limb of the 
corolla violet; its mouth not more glandular than my specimens 
of the last. But the calyx is rather more tumid, and the 5- 
notched stigma, accompanied by a furrowed s<2/Ze, appears to con- 
stitute a sound specific character. The stamens being situated 
a little lower in the tube is of no consequence. The variable- 
ness of that circumstance is well known to cultivators of the 
Polyanthus. Whether this be the P. stricta of Fl. Dan., can 
only be ascertained by specimens, which I have not seen of 
either. It is much to be wished that specific names, taken from 
particular countries, perpetually introduced by gardeners, were 
not sanctioned by superior authorities. It will be fortunate if 
stricta, the older name, should prove to belong to this species.

Root globular, brown, sending out many branched fibres. Leaves 
beautifully variegated with dark and glaucous green ; their un- 
der side paler, purplish, with slightly glandular ribs. Foot-stalks 
round, more glandular ; tapering and wavy at the base. Flowers 
pendulous, on naked wavy stalks, taller than the leaves. Cor. 
white, or flesh-coloured ; purplish about the mouth. As the 
fruit advances, the flower-stalks curl spirally, and bury it in the 
earth. A very acrid plant, especially the root, whose acrimony 
is not much perceived at the first tasting, but soon becomes in- 
tolerable.

Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf, in 5 deep, slightly spreading, seg- 
ments, permanent. Cor. of 1 petal, funnel-shaped ; tube 
short, somewhat dilated upward; limb divided beyond 
the middle, into 5 spreading or recurved, more or less 
pointed, segments, bearded on the disk, at the base, or 
at the margin. Filam. awl-shaped, short, attached to the 
tube, alternate with the segments of the limb. Anth. doyen 
at the base, erect. Germ, conical. Style cylindrical, about 
equal to the stamens. Stigma lobed or notched. Caps. 
ovate, surrounded at the lower part by the calyx, of 1 
cell, and 2, more or less separable, valves. Seeds nume- 
rous, attached to the margins of each valve. 

Villarsia is kept distinct from the original Menyanthes, by 
Mr. Brown, after the example of Tournefort, Wiggers, 
Ventenat, and others, chiefly because of its corolla having 
to each segment a bordered fringed margin ; while the 
base of the limb, not the middle of the disk, is hairy, or 
bearded. The leaves moreover are simple, not ternate. 
But as this able botanist is doubtful of the natural order 
of both his genera, which renders their limitation the 
more precarious ; and differs from Wiggers in believing 
they belong to one and the same order; I greatly scruple 
to divide them. They are herbaceous, perennial, smooth, 
aquatic or bog, plants, very vascular, with stalked leaves 
andjlowers. Leaves ternate, and j^otD^rs clustered, white 
or reddish, densely shaggy, in Menyanthes. Leaves simple, 
undivided, and ji. axillary, or clustered, mostly yellow, 
with a darker, elevated, naked disk, in Villarsia.

1 presume to correct the erroneous construction of the specific 
name, as Tournefort, who has led every body else to write nym-

but to its fellow-creature the Nymphcea.

Mr. Leathes thinks essential to this species. I have not in-

That the American Azalece of the gardens must constitute 
a distinct genus, has long been thought. But whatever 
shall be determined concerning them, the plant before us 
is the identical Azalea, on which this genus was founded, 
and which alone, except perhaps A. lapponica, answers 
to the generic description of its author.

channelled Aov^ny footstalks, not one fourth of their own length. 
Flower-stalks as long as the leaves, sometimes divided, angular, 
swelling upward, bearing 2 minute, downy, lanceolate bracteas

nicled at the top. Leaves alternate^ of many elliptic-lanceolate, 
entire leciflets, with an odd one of nearly equal size. Fl. rather 
drooping, numerous, blue, occasionally white. Stalks and calyx 
a little downy. A common ornament of rustic gardens, of no 
particular qualities, notwithstanding its name of Valerian, de- 
rived perhaps from the leaves, which resemble those of some 
Valeriance. It is not known to be a Greek plant, nor does Dios- 
corides appear to have mentioned it.

Cal. superior of 1 leaf, in 5 deep, acute, rather spreading 
segments ; in some with intermediate, reflexed, tumid 
lobes ; permanent. Cor. of 1 petal, bell-shaped, more or 
less expanded, withering ; impervious at the base, com- 
bined with the calyx, and furnished at the lower part with 
5 acute, converging valves, concealing the summit of the 
germen ; limb in 5 broad, spreading, regular segments. 
Filam. from the point of each valve, capillary, short, re- 
tractile. Anth. longer than their filaments, linear, com- 
pressed, spreading. Germ, inferior, angular. Style thread- 
shaped, downy, longer than the stamens. Stigma in 2 or 
3 oblong, revolute segments. Caps, roundish, obovate, 
or prismatic, angular and ribbed, of 3 cells, rarely 2 
only, bursting by 3 torn lateral openings, between the 
ribs ; or sometimes valvular at the summit. Seeds nume- 
rous, small, polished. 

Milky herbs ; seldom shrubby. Leaves almost always al- 
ternate ; simple, or rarely compound ; smooth or rough. 
Fl. variously situated, mostly blue, inodorous. The style^ 
partly very hairy, receives the pollen before it reaches the 
stigma, and retains it long.

C. sylvestris minima. Dod. Pempt. 167 ; the same figure. 

On heaths, walls, banks, and about the borders of fields, common. 

Perennial. July, August. 

Root somewhat creeping, rather woody. Herb smooth, dark green. 
Stems more or less crowded, upright, round, sometimes a little 
dawny, about a span high, slightly, if at all, branched, each termi- 
nating in a loose cluster of a few drooping, h\\ie flowers, on long, 
slender, tremulous stalks, with an awl-shaped bractea to each. 
The radical leaves are numerous, heart-shaped, with a blunt point, 
and 4 or 5 bluntish serratures at each side ; their footstalks 
thrice as long as the leaves, linear and very narrow ; some of 
these leaves are often kidney-shaped ; others ovate, or lanceo- 
late, and entire. They all usually wither very soon, so that the 
plant, when in flower, is found with stem-leaves only, which are 
long, lii^ear, acute, entire and very narrow, tapering at the base 
into short footstalks. Segments of the calyx linear-awl-shaped, 
entire, spreading. Cor. thrice as long, twisted in decay. Cap- 
sule roundish. Sometimes, though rarely, X\\e. flowers are white. 

On mountain rocks this species may perhaps assume a more humble 
stature, with fewer flowers ; nor are such variations unusual with 
it in barren ground. One of them was originally taken for 
C. uniflora of Linnasus, a very difi'erent plant, by Mr. Hudson ; 
and probably by Ray for C. alpina rotundifolia minor, of Bauh. 
Prodr. 34. This latter is really C. parva Anguillarce Cantabrica, 
Bauh. Hist. V. 2. 796 ; and there is a good figure in each of these 
places. It is C. n. 702 of Haller ; C. t. 189 of Fl. Dan.; and 
C. pumila of Dr. Sims in Curt. Mag. t.b\2 ; being C. ccFspitosa 
of Villars, and of Scopoli, as well as pusilla of Haenke in Jaaj. 
Coll V.2. 79. In our gardens it is usually white, and grows 
luxuriantly under a frame, or in the open border ; being doubt- 
less a constant and very distinct species, characterized by the 
numerous serrated, obovate or lanceolate, stem -leaves ; to say 
nothing of its smaller size, and brighter green hue. I have no 
authority for believing that this C. ccespitosa, for so it should be 
called, has ever been seen wild in Britain. In the Fl. Brit. 1 re- 
lied on former authors, who have every one of them committed 
some error in the synonyms, which the detail here given will 
enable the reader to trace. 

2. C. patula. Spreading Bell-flower. 

Radical leaves obovate, or elliptic -lanceolate; the rest linear- 
lanceolate ; all even, crenate and roughish. Stem with 
several fringed angles. Panicle spreading. Calyx minutel}'^

spreading at the summit. Radical leaves stalked, spreading, 
obovate, elliptical, or oblong, obtuse, bluntly crenate, roughish, 
or fringed ; turning yellow, and withering when the flowers ap- 
pear ; the stem-leaves are alternate, sessile, lanceolate or linear, 
acute, less crenate, and rather smoother. Fl. of a fine blue, larger 
than the preceding, more tapering at the lower part ; the limb 
ribbed, gradually spreading. Segments of the calyx awl-shaped, 
with one or more livid teeth on each side, towards the base. The 
herbage, though bitter and milky, is often eaten by cattle.

Root somewhat creeping. Stans li or 2 feet high, erect, simple, 
round, pale, very smooth, more or less leafy. Leaves long and 
narrow, with very shallow serratures, especially the uppermost, 
which are acute, and nearly entire. Fl. very large, above an inch 
wide, of a fine blue, erect. Germen often hairy, as Scopoli re- 
marks ; but this character is not invariable. Segments of the 
calyx long, lanceolate, entire, very smooth and even. Haller 
erroneously applies to this species Linnseus's remark of the 
toothed caly.v in C.patula. 

The /lowers are often solitary in wild specimens. In gardens, where 
they ai"e generally double, and often of a brilliant white, there are 
always several on each stem. This plant being a native of most 
parts of the continent, from Sweden to Greece, may well be 
found also in Scotland, and I concur with Professor Hooker in 
admitting it. Mr. G. Don's specimens have a perfectly wild 
aspect.

often as pungent as those of a Nettle, though not venomous. 

The name Trachelium, from rpoL^TjXos, the neck, alludes to the re-

oblong-heart-shaped, on long stalks ; upper ones more acute, 
ovate, sessile, clasping the stem ; all crenate, hoary all over 
with short close hairs ; paler at the back. Fl. of a purplish, 
deep, but rich, blue, most of them in a dense terminal head, 
subtended by 2 broad, concave, pointed, hoary bracteas â–  a few 
occasionally, solitary or in pairs, sessile from the bosoms of the 
upper leaves. Col. simply 5-cleft, hoary. Cor. rather cylindri-

Perennial. August. 

Root long and woody, divided at the crown. Herb milky, not 
acrid. Stems solitary, simple, leafy, somewhat angular, smooth, 
a foot high, or more. Leaves smooth, crenate, with a midrib 
and many reticulated veins ; the earliest radical ones heart- 
shaped ; the next, like those on the lower part of the stem, el- 
liptic-lanceolate ; all on long stalks : those on the upper part 
ovate or lanceolate, sessile, fruiged at the base. Fl. of an in- 
tensely brilliant deep blue, numerous, inodorous, sessile, forming 
a round head, accompanied by several close, ovate-lanceolate, 
leafy bracteas. As the 3-cclled capsules ripen, the head be- 
comes oval, and the parts of the flower, after lasting long in a 
faded state, are finally, as Professor Hooker observes, deciduous, 
except the fringed culijx. Tlie figures of Morison and Bar- 
relier are copied from tliat of Columna.

Root tapering, rather woody, said to be occasionally perennial in 
the south of Europe ; see Willdenow. Herb rough with short 
rigid hairs. Sians several, a span high, simple or branched, 
roundish, leafy. Leaves sessile, oblong, bluntish, wavy, entire 
or unequally serrated, gradually smaller from the root upwards, 
alternate. Fl. small, in round, solitary, terminal tufts, on short 
partial stalks, each tu/t surrounded by several ovate bracieas,^ 
analogous to those of Phyteuma, which Linnaeus esteemed a ge- 
neral calyx, misled by the idea of a compound flower, suggested 
probably by the combined anthers. Corolla light blue. Stigma 
purplish. 

This plant is closely related to Phyteuma; but the partitions of the 
capsule, and its terminal entire orifice, added to the combined. 
anthers, afford perhaps good marks of generic distinction.

Fl. large and handsome, yellow, spotted internally with red, 4

when nearly ripe elastic, bursting asunder with the slightest

often abortive. The leaves wither very soon after gathering ; 
but I cannot find that they hang down in a flaccid state during 
the night, as Villars reports, whatever may be the case after a 
day of southern sunshine, as he saw them in Dauphiny. Dodo- 
naeus speaks of this as a plant of pernicious qualities : and Ray 
says it is dangerously diuretic.

[Ventenat declares, after Jussieu, that Viola is the type of a 
natural oi'der, presumed to exist, but of which no other 
genus is known. It were better to say it cannot be referred 
to any known order; for though it possesses here and 
there a character of several different orders, it is hardly 
allied, on the whole to any one.] 

Cal. inferior, permanent, of 5 ovate-oblong, erect, equal, 
acute leaves, inserted above their obtuse base ; 2 of them 
subtending the uppermost petal ; one each of the lateral 
petals ; and one the 2 lowermost. Cor. irregular, of 5 un- 
equal petals ; the uppermost solitary, broadest, most ob- 
tuse, slightly cloven, directed downward (the position of 
the flower being reversed), terminating at the base in a 
horn-shaped blunt nectary, projecting betwixt the calyx- 
leaves ; 2 lateral petals opposite, equal, obtuse, straight ; 
2 lowermost (turned upward) equal, larger. Filam. very 
small, 2 of which, adjoining the odd petal, have 2 com- 
bined spurs, which enter the nectary. Anth. broad, con- 
verging, scarcely connected, obtuse, each tenninating in 
a membranous point. Germ, superior, roundish. Style 
thread-shaped, projecting beyond the anthers. Stigma 
oblique, pointed or concave. Caps, ovate, triangular, ob- 
tuse, of 1 cell and 3 rigid, finally reflexed, valves. Seeds 
several in each cell, ovate, polished, attached to the linear 
central receptacle of each valve. 

The stigma of V. odorata, and its allies, is a simjjle hooked 
point ; in V. tricolor, and others of the Pansy tribe, it is 
a hollow knob, perforated at the summit, and gaping oc- 
casionally. The Jlouoer is reversed, or inverted, in all the 
Europaean species ; in most of the Indian ones erect. 

The species are numerous, almost entirely herbaceous, and 
of humble stature. Stem trailing, or erect, or wanting. 
Leaves stalked, simple, mostly alternate; in some instances 
deeply divided ; in all crenate, or serrated. Stipulas in 
pairs, various and remarkable. Fl. on simple stalks, va- 
riously coloured ; very often streaked in a radiant man- 
ner, like Ferotiica. One species especially is highly fra- 
grant, and gives its name to a peculiar deep purplish-blue

longer than the leaves, erect, rough with copious, prominent, 
horizontal hairs. Stipidas lanceolate, chiefly radical, more or

above, though slightly downy underneath. Footstalks nearly 
smooth. Stipulas lanceolate, with taper-pointed teeth. Flotver- 
stalks taller than the leaves, with a pair of narrow bracteas above 
their middle, smooth. Flower drooping, deep purplish blue; 
pale and streaked in the mouth ; with orange-tipped, uncon- 
nected anthers ; its scent well known, and universally accepta- 
ble, though sometimes causing headache. The Jlowers in /3 are 
white, with a blueish spwr. A double variety, highly fragrant,

Much smaller than the last, and quite smooth. Stems creeping at 
the base, then ascending, 2 or 3 inches high, round, or very 
slightly angular in some parts, leafy. Leaves ovate-lanceolate, 
bluntish, finely crenate ; the lowermost sometimes very small, 
ovate, or even heart-shaped. Footstalks dilated, or bordered, 
towards the upper part, generally longer than the leaves. Sfi- 
pulas deeply toothed, cut, or often pinnatifid. Flower-stalks 
much like caniria. Flower smaller. Calyx-leaves long, linear. 
Petals milk-white, or of a very pale blue, with purplish streaks. 
Anth. tipped with a yellow membrane, distinct. Pistil as in ca- 
nina. The hracteas are usually broader than in that species, and 
more or less serrated, but this character seems variable. So 
many botanists have distinguished this plant, and it is so little 
changed by culture, except perhaps, as Boehmer says, in size, 
â– that I cannot but retain it as a species, notwithstanding many

Root of many long fibres. Stejn an inch or 2 high, partly decum- 
bent, but not creeping, much branched, curved and twisted, per- 
fectly shrubby, and lasting many years. Leaves alternate, firm, 
rigid, very even and smooth, heart-shaped, obtuse, minutely cre- 
nate, scarcely half an inch long, on linear footstalks about the 
same length. Stipulas deeply serrated, or fringed with glan- 
dular teeth. Flower-stalks 1^ or 2 inches long, erect, bearing 
towards the top a pair of minute, linear, finely fringed bracteas. 
Fl. half the size of V. canina, of a rather deeper blue, with a

short, blunt, yellowish spur. Calyx-leaves lanceolate, pointed. 
Capsule shorter and rounder than in canina. 
This little plant, long ago communicated by the late Mr. Crowe, 
is not uncommon, though usually neglected as a variety of the 
V. canina. It has remained unchanged, and of the same hum- 
ble stature, perfectly shrubby, for above 12 years, in a common 
garden ; and seems entitled to rank as a species, under the sy- 
nonym of Dillenius, though his figure by no means represents 
the true nature of the stem, nor does it exhibit any of the parts 
most material for specific discrimination. I have already ad- 
verted to this Violet in Reess Cydopcedia under the canina, n,

In cultivated fields. 

Annual, May â€” September. 

Root fibrous, small. Stems 1 or more, weak, decumbent, a span 
long, scarcely branched, except at the very bottom, leafy, angu- 
lar, often zigzag, downy chiefly on one side. Leaves alternate, 
stalked, ovate-oblong, deeply crenate, ribbed, a little downy ; 
the lower ones often heart-shaped, especially in the variety /3. 
Stipulas all deeply pinnatifid, with narrow tongue-shaped, or 
linear, segments ; the terminal one very large, ovate, or elliptic- 
oblong, crenate. Flower-stalks axillary, solitary, longer than the 
leaves, firm, with a pair of minute close bracteas near the sum- 
mit. Calyx-leaves lanceolate, acute, smooth or downy, mostly 
fringed, especially at the base, where they are much and un- 
equally dilated. Petals very variable in size and colour, gene-

In moist mountainous pastures. 

Very common in the mountainous parts of \Vales, and the north 
of England, as well as in Scotland. 

Perennial. May â€” September. 

Root fibrous, slender. Stem 3 or 4 inches high, simple, leafy, tri- 
angular, a little downy at one side 5 tapering, weak, and de- 
cumbent at the base, where it is sometimes, though very rarely, 
divided. Leaves alternate, stalked, ovate, strongly crenate, a 
little hairy, especially at the edges; the lowermost small, round- 
ed, or hea'-t-shaped. Stipulaslarge, deeply palmate, or fingered ; 
their middle segments largest. Flower-stalks one or two on each 
plant, axillary, solitaiy, rising much above the top of the stem. 
Bracteas towards the upper part of each stalk, alternate, small, 
oblong, obtuse, occasionally with 2 small teeth at their base. 
Fl. larger than the last, with which the calyx nearly agrees, but 
the corolla is generally yellow, with blackish, branched, radiating 
lines ; the lateral petals palest ; the 2 upper ones sometimes 
purple. When all are purple, as sometimes happens. Professor 
Hooker says this is V. amcena of authors. The anthers are di- 
stinct, with a small orange-coloured appendage. Style with a 
double curvature. Stigma club-shaped, hollow, hairy at the 
sides, marked underneath with a dark purple line. All the pe- 
tals are densely bearded round the mouth of the flower. 

Great confusion has existed between this veiy distinct species and 
the Linnasan V. grandiflora, whose flowers are twice as large, 
and the spur twice as long as the posterior lobes of the calyx ; 
whereas in f. lutea those parts are of the same length ; see 
Rees's Cycl. n. 67.

[The Solanece of Jussieu are better defined than heretofore, 
as well as better contrasted with that author's Scrophiila- 
rice, by Mr. Brown, Prodr. 443, as follows. 

Calyx in S, rarely only 4, divisions, permanent. Corolla 
monopetalous, inferioi', deciduous ; the limb in 5, rarely 
4, segments, regular, or a little unequal ; in the most 
genuine of the tribe, plaited in the bud ; in the more 
doubtful ones, imbricated. Stam. attached to the corolla, 
as many as the segments of its limb, and alternate there- 
with ; one of them sometimes abortive. Gcrmen single, 
of 2 or 4 cells, with many seeds. Style 1 . Stigma obtuse, 
rarely lobed. Fruit with 2 or 4 cells ; either a capside, 
with a parallel and double partition ,- or a berry whose 
receptacles are united to the partition. Seeds numerous, 
sessile ; with a fleshy albumen ; embryo internal, more or 
less curved, often out of the centre ; radicle directed to- 
wards the scar. 

Leaves undivided, or lobed. Partial flower-stalks without 
bracteas. For the rest see Grammar. 

These plants are distinguished from the Scropliulari(c of 
Jussieu and Brown, (many of which are comprehended 
by Linnagus under his Luridce,) by having a curved or 
spiral embryo, and a corolla plaited in the bud, the 
flowers being, almost without exception, regular, with as 
many stamens as there are segments. " Hence," as Mr, 
Brown observes, "the genera whose corolla is not plaited, 
and whose embryo is straight, should either be excluded, 
or should be placed, with such as have an imbricated 
corolla, a slightly curved embryo, and 2 long, with 2 
shorter, stamens, in a separate section, the foundation of 
a new oi'der."]

The mule variety /3 I have never seen wild ; nor is there any au- 
thentic specimen in the Linnaean herbarium. Mr. Griffith of 
Denbighshire has favoured me with specimens artificially pro- 
cured, from V. Lychnitis by the pollen of V. Thapsus,vA\\c\\ an- 
swer to the description of Linnaeus, except that he mentions 
" a purplish beard upon \he filaments, though less so than in 
V- Lychnitis." To explain this, we must recollect that he con- 
founded with the Lychnitis our V. pulverulent urn, whose stamens 
are scarlet, for which colour he often uses the word purpureus. 
Professor Link has sent from Portugal specimens, which agree 
with Mr. Griffith's, as his F. Thapsoides. But the corolla of both 
is yellow ; beard of the filaments white. Their upper leaves are 
somewhat decurrent. The species of Verbascum are extremely 
obscure, and so, of course, are their intermixed varieties.

13 from its characters rather seems to be produced by the pollen of 
this plant falling upon T'. nigrum, of which latter therefore it 
oughtj perhaps, to be deemed a variety. But the habit most 
agrees with the pulverulentum, though the stem and branches are 
more angular, and tinged with purple. Leaves less woolly, and 
more strongly crenate. Hairs of the stamens violet-coloured. 
Radical leaves considerably stalked. Root generally, if not al- 
ways, perennial. 

If the stem of F. pulverulentum be smartly struck, 3 or 4 times, 
with a stick, all the flowers then open will, in a few minutes, 
throw oft" their corolla, the calijx closing round the germen, so 
that after 8 or 10 minutes none will remain on the plant. This 
curious instance of irritability was first pointed out to me by 
Don Joseph Correa de Serra, late Portuguese aiiibassador to the 
United States, whose scientific knowledge, and philosophical 
views of every subject, have long procured him universal resjiecl, 
and at length the notice and confidence of his sovereign.

Root spindle-shaped. Stem bushy. Leaves sessile, soft and pliant, 
sharply lobed, downy and viscid, exhaling a powerful and op- 
pressive odour, like all the rest of the plant. Fl. numerous from 
the bosoms of the crowded upper leaves, almost entirely sessile, 
of an elegant straw-colour, pencilled with dark-purple veins. A 
variety without these veins, mentioned by several writers, was 
found at Fincham in Norfolk, by the Rev. R. Forby, with an in- 
termediate kind, very faintly veiny. The capsules and seeds of 
Henbane, smoked like tobacco, are a rustic remedy for the tooth- 
ache j but convulsions and temporary insanity are said to be 
sometimes the consequences of their use. The seeds, abounding 
with oil, may safely be eaten raw, at least in small quantities ; 
and an extract of the herb, very cautiously administered, is re- 
commended by some physicians as an opiate.

struction. Only half one of these fruits is said to have proved 
fatal, producing a deadly stupor. To make the patients swallow 
vinegar, and to keep them from sleeping, may avert the fatal 
consequences. Emetics do not take effect. The leaves applied 
externally, as well as taken in powder, or infusion, have been 
recommended to cure cancers ; but their use in any way occa- 
sions dreadful uneasiness, horrors and swoonings, so that few 
practitioners can persevere long in prescribing so distressing and 
ambiguous a remedy.

Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf, in 5, more or less deep, acute seg- 
ments, permanent. Cor. of 1 petal, wheel-shaped ; tube 
very short; limb much longer, reflexed, plaited, in 5 
acute, equal, rather deep, segments. Filam. short, awl-

A numerous, principally tropical, genus of shrubs or herbs, 
more or less narcotic, though in some cases rendered 
eatable by cookery. Stem leaf}', in some exotic species 
prickly. Leaves alternate, stalked, rarely decurrent, mostly 
simple, often variously lobed ; in some compound. Ft. 
variously disposed, sohtary or aggregate, drooping, in-

smooth ; in variety (3 hairy ; the lower ones ovate, or heart- 
shaped ; upper more or less perfectly halberd-shaped ; all en- 
tire at the margin. Clusters either opposite to the leaves or 
terminal, drooping, spreading, smooth, alternately subdivided, 
and resembling cymes, though not really such. Bracteas minute. 
Fl. elegant, purple with 2 round green spots at the base of each 
segment. They are reported to vary occasionally to white or 
flesh-colour, the spots being also sometimes white. Berries oval, 
scarlet, juicy, bitter and poisonous. The root and young branches,

Root fibrous. Herb fetid, narcotic, bushy, with numerous, angular, 
or winged, leafy branches. Leaves undivided ; lengthened out 
at the base, smooth. Umbels from the intermediate spaces be- 
tween the leaves, solitary, stalked, simple, downy. Fl. white, 
with a musky scent. Berries globular, black ; sometimes, as it 
is reported, yellow. A grain or two of the dried leaf has some- 
times been given to promote various secretions, possibly by ex- 
citing a great, and rather dangerous, agitation in the viscera. 

Many exotic varieties of this Solanum are mentioned by authors, 
which perhaps may be entitled to rank as species.

Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf, in 5 deep, erect, acute, awl-shaped 
segments, sometimes united below by a membranous 
border, permanent. Cor. of 1 petal, salver-shaped ; tube 
nearly cylindrical, slender, longer than the calyx ; limb 
in 5 deep, ovate or lanceolate, equal, spreading segments, 
about half the length of the tube, withering. Filam. 
thread-shaped, equal, inserted into the tube, alternate with 
the segments of the limb, and much shorter. Anth. ob- 
long, incumbent, twisting spii'ally as the pollen ripens. 
Germen elliptic-oblong, or nearly linear, compressed. 
Style terminal, cylindrical, prominent, on a level with the 
stamens, straight, and generally erect. Stigmas 2, round- 
ish, spreading till after impregnation. Caps, elliptic-ob- 
long, nearly linear, acute at each â€¢ end, compressed, im- 
perfectly 2-celled, of 2 valves with inflexed margins. 
Seeds numerous, roundish, in 4 rows, placed alternately 
on the inflexed margins of the valves. 

Herbaceous, annual, almost perfectly smooth, vei'y bitter. 
Stem erect, square, either simple or very much branched, 
in the same species. Leaves opposite, sessile, ribbed, un- 
divided, entire. Inflor. simple, spiked, forked, or corym- 
bose. Fl. rose-coloured, or yellow. 

A very natural genus, well distinguished from Chironia by 
the above characters ; particularly the long tube and 
short limb ; straight style ; 2 stigmas ; and almost linear 
ca]:)sule, destitute of a separate partition, or receptacle. 
The annual root and whole habit differ also from Chi- 
7-onia, which is shrubby. The name Erythrcsa, alluding 
to the red colour of most of the flowers, is justly retained 
for its priority of date, and fortunately is unexceptionable. 
Chironia however, alluding to the botanical Centaur, 
would more properly have belonged to the Ccntanrium 
mimis, the type of our present TLrythrcea ; though from 
the first appropriated to an African genus, from which it 
can by no means be removed.

Stems generally about 2 inches high, stout, simple and solitary ; 
sometimes, especially in the variety /3, there are several together 
from the crown of the root ; from 3 to 5 or G inches in height, 
and somewhat forked at the top, like the first species. Leaves all 
linear-obovate, obtuse, often roughish at the edges, with an 
obscure marginal rib at each side, not extending so far as the 
mid-rib ; radical ones very little larger or broader than the rest, 
which are variously disposed, mostly crowded about the top and 
bottom of the stem, and an inch long. All the leaves indeed 
seem liable to vary in breadth, and when they become almost 
elliptical, there are 2 additional ribs. Fl. rather larger and hand- 
somer than the foregoing, for the most part sessile, and crowded 
into a dense head, or a partly forked, compact, corymbose pa- 
nicle, which last is most usual in /3. Segments of the calyx more 
or less combined above the base, their edges somewhat, but not 
uniformly, membranous; they are often minutely downy, some- 
times 3-ribbed. As the capsule swells, the tube of the corolla 
becomes longer than the calyx ; but never till the flower fades. 
The style is perfectly straight and upright. The variety ^ is the

from the last species, as well as from E. Ccntaurium, being some- 
times almost orbicular, with 7 ribs in their lower part ; more 
generally broadly elliptical, and obtuse, with 5 ribs. The calyx 
is as long as the tube, or longer ; its segments broad and mem- 
branous below ; tapering at the upper part. JniJi. spiral when

starved state, as Dr. Swartz met with it, quite simple and single- 
flowered ; in every form it is leafy, and square, with mem- 
branous, more or less dilated, angles. Leaves ovate, bluntish, 
with 3 or 5 slender ribs ; the upper ones more lanceolate ; 
lowest obovate, or round. FL stalked, from each fork, as well 
as from each termination, of the stem, erect, slender. Cal above 
half as long as the tube even in an advanced state ; at an early 
period full as long, with slender awl-shaped segments, combined 
by a membranous base. Cor. with a pale slender tube ; the limb 
of a full pink, as delicate and narrow as in the last, much less 
ovate than in the two former species. The anthers are less spiral 
than in any of them, making scarcely one turn. Style a little 
oblique, with large spreading stigtnas. Caps, long, tumid, in- 
vested with the corolla, as in other species.

Cal. inferior, of 1 leaf; tube hemispherical, closely investing 
the lower half of the germen ; margin in 5 deep, triangu- 
lar, equal, permanent segments. C07: of 1 petal, funnel- 
shaped ; tube wide, as long as the calyx ; limb spreading, 
in 5 deep, obtuse segments, with 5 small, intermediate, 
converging scales at their base. Filam. from the middle 
of the tube, opposite to the segments of the limb, awl- 
shaped, short. Anth. sheltered by the scales of the corolla, 
roundish, 2-lobed. Geim. superior, invested with the 
tube of the calyx, nearly globular. Style erect, short, co- 
lumnar. Stigma capitate. Caps, globular, of 1 cell ; its 
lower half closely invested with the tube of the calyx ; 
upper opening with 5 recurved valves. Seeds numerous, 
small, angular, attached to the globose, central, uncon- 
nected receptacle. 

Herbaceous. Leaves alternate, undivided ; tapering at the 
base into footstalks. Fl. terminal, racemose, bracteated, 
white. 

This genus has marks of considerable affinity to Montia, 
n. 62, and therefore to Jussieu's 86th order, Portulacece. 
The apparently half inferior situation of the germen has 
caused some doubts in the minds of the ablest botanists, 
whether it could be referred to the Lysimachia;, now 
termed Primulacece. But that part is surely to be reckoned 
superior; nor, were it otherwise, is such a difference 
always essential ; witness Vaccinium and Erica. See 
Grammar 112, 214., 216.

Cal. superior, small, of 1 leaf, in 5 deep segments. Cor. of 
1 petal, tubular ; tube oblong, swelling at one side ; limb 
in 5 deep revolute segments, one of them more deeply 
separated than the rest. Filam. awl-shaped, inserted into 
the upper part of the tube, and about equal to the limb. 
Anth. incumbent, oblong. Germ, roundish, inferior. Style 
thread-shaped, reclining, about the length of the corolla. 
Stigma bluntly capitate. Berry roundish with a concave 
scar, of 1 or more cells, sometimes double and confluent. 
Seeds several, roundish, compressed. 

Caprifolium, which includes the original Periclymemim, 
though not that of Tournefort, has the limb of the corolla 
very unequally divided. The Jlowers are whorled, or 
capitate, bracteated. Berries solitary and distinct. Stem 
twining. 

Xylosteon, or rather Xylosteum, has a more deeply divided, 
but not more regular, corolla, the tube being very short.

Fl. in pairs, bracteated. Berries single-celled, distinct. 
Stem erect. 

The branches, as well as leaves, of both are opposite ; the 
latter simple, undivided, except casually ; in some partly 
confluent and perfoliate. FL often fragrant. Fruit not 
eatable. 

With the other Linnaean sections, whether entitled to rank 
as distinct genera or not, we have no concern in an En- 
glish Flora. I cannot account for the words " stijlis in- 
divisis " in the original specific character of L. cccrulea, 
which apply, as Mr. Brovi^n observes, to the whole genus. 
The germens of each pair of flowers are indeed perfectly 
united, or " undivided," in this species ; so that, as Lin- 
naeus expresses it in his manuscript, " there are 2 flowers 
to the same germen ;" and perhaps he wrote originally 
" baccis coadunato-globosis, stj/lis divisis."

various in degree of acidity. One of the most wholesome and 
grateful of fruits, especially if tempered with sugar. 1 have not

Haller has " stipulcc brevissimx," meaning hractece ; and by mistake, 
in his Nomenclator, has " foUis," instead ofjioribus, " planius-

This species, abundant in Switzerland, is certainly wliat Haller in- 
tended under his n. 818, though he supposed the cultivated 
Currants to be the same. He quotes R.Jlore rubente of John 
Bauhin, Hist. v. 2. 98, who gives no figure. Mr. Davall thought 
this the only wild Swiss Currant, except alpinum and nigrum. 
Jacquin's figure is erroneously drawn by Wulfen, with long awl- 
shaped bracteas, quite different from his own specimens.

This has the habit of the two foregoing species, but differs from 
both in the extreme shortness of the partial Jlower-stallcs, ren- 
dering the inflorescence a spike, rather than a cluster, which, 
moreover, is erect both in flower and fruit. If these characters 
be not constant, the present species probably belongs to R.pe- 
trceum; which seems scarcely credible.

Shrub. Maij. 

Stem lower, and more spreading, than R. ruhrum. Leaves larger 
and softer, glandular, with a strong Savine-like scent, when 
rubbed. Fl. green, in drooping hairy clusters, remarkable for a 
separate stalk at the base, whose fruit is earlier and larger than 
the rest. Cal. tubular-bell-shaped, with reflexed segments. 
Pet. ovate. Berries large, globose, black, gratefully subacid, 
with some of the flavour of the leaves. They are esteemed very 
useful in sore throats of any sort ; and by some writers are 
reckoned powerfully diuretic ; but according to Dr. Woodville 
this wants confirmation. Dr. Withering observed the petals to 
change occasionally into stamens ; the only instance upon record 
of such a metamorphosis.

three-lobed, and variously cut, a little hairy, of a pleasant green 
while young. Footstalks hairy. FL green, or pale flesh-coloured, 
bell-shaped, on simple drooping stalks, thickened upwards, 
mostly 2 together, from the same bud as the leaves and future 
branches. Bracteas small, ovate, fringed, in pairs, rarely 3, a 
little below each flower ; sometimes united into a tube at the 
base, which Linneeus thought a mark of the Smooth-fruited 
Gooseberry, my j3, but it is not at all constant. Segments of 
the cabjx reflexed, often coloured. Fet. ovate. Germen gene- 
rally hairy. .S(;?//e often scarcely cloven, sometimes double. Berry 
elliptic-oblong, or nearly globular, green or yellowish, rough 
with scattered hairs ; in /3 smooth j but Mr. Robson found this 
not a permanent specific character. Cultivated varieties are of- 
ten red or blackish. The Gooseberry is well known as a most 
wholesome fruit, chiefly confined to cold or temperate climates, 
neglected in Switzerland, and with difficulty raised in Italy. 
R. redinatum of Linnseus seems a mere variety with long deflexed 
branches, not uncommon.

accompanied at the base by several small bracteas. Petals re- 
flexed. Berry the size of a currant, smooth, black ; internally 
whitish and mealy, with seldom more than 5 seeds. The whole 
plant is somewhat aromatic; and a very fragrant resin exudes
