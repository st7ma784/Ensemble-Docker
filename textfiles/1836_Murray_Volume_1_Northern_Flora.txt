MY LORD, 

It will excite no surprise, that permission has been solicited to dedi- 
cate to your Lordship an attempt to illustrate the native vegetation of the North 
and East of Scotland, as the request will, doubtless, appear to be sufficiently ex- 
plained by your Lordship's high rank and important hereditary connexion with the 
tract to which the undertaking relates. Without, however, any view to those cir- 
cumstances, but contemplating solely your Lordship's personal character â€” founded 
upon qualities, attainments, and talents, which do not need to be here recorded â€” 
I know not where another could have been found, whatsoever his local situation 
or his rank, better fitted than your Lordship for conferring honour upon this 
or any other publication. That a knowledge of botanical science enables your 
Lordship to be a competent judge of any observations pertaining to that sub- 
ject, is a fact which may also be adverted to on the present occasion, particularly 
as it is, perhaps, comparatively but little known. 

These reasons might have well created a desire of the honour now 
in view ; but it may be permitted me to say, that it was no mere wish to con- 
nect these pages with rank and name, joined with ability to appreciate their 
merit (if they possess any), which directed my thoughts to your Lordship ; for the 



IV DEDICATION. 

truth simply is, that the request already alluded to, may he said to have arisen 
from the interest taken by your Lordship in this publication, which was felt to be 
the kinder, because of its being equally unexpected and unsought. Your Lord- 
ship, moreover, was pleased to favour me with a Catalogue of indigenous plants 
growing in a small northern district, and with an opportunity to examine the 
corresponding specimens collected by your own hand ; while, with no little per- 
sonal trouble, your Lordship had the condescension also to point out the places 
wherein some of the more interesting species had been discovered. 

I have thus, my Lord, though aware that they possess no general in- 
terest, taken the liberty of noticing the circumstances, owing to which these pages â€” 
little worthy, it is feared, of being in any manner connected with so distinguished 
a name â€” are now, with profound respect, inscribed to your Lordship. 

I have tbe honour to be, 

My Lord, 
Your Lordship's most obedient 

and very humble Servant,

PREFACE 



In addition to Works of a more general nature, separate accounts 
of the native vegetable productions of particular districts have, in 
many parts of the world, been long ago given to the public. 
It is also true, that while there are local Floras in no small 
number, which relate to various parts of England as well as to 
the South and West of Scotland, no similar attempt has at any 
time been made, regarding the counties which lie in the North 
and East of Britain. It cannot be said that this deficiency is sup- 
plied by publications having a more extensive range ; for, not to 
mention Floras comprehending the whole island â€” which, however, 
do not contain the small notice of this quarter, to have been ex- 
pected even from works with so wide an object â€” it may be fairly 
observed, that the Scottish Floras of Lightfoot and Hooker belong 
to the South and West of the kingdom, rather than to Scotland in 
general. At least, with some knowledge of both these, doubtless, 
important and interesting contributions to Botany, I cannot bring to 
recollection any proof that either of the authors ever set foot on the 
extensive plain, which may be alluded to in a general way, as' ex- 
tending from Angus to Nairn â€” unless, indeed, it may be the state- 
ment of Lightfoot, in his Preface, that he " traversed the kingdom 
from Argyleshire to the county of the Mearns" â€” while their commu- 
nications from correspondents, relative to that tract, particularly to 
Aberdeenshire and the contiguous counties, are so meagre as 
scarcely to be worthy of notice, or of being taken into any practical 
account. 

With the causes of this comparative deficiency I am unacquaint- 
ed, and to discover these is no part of the object now in view ; as it is 
enough, if the present publication, besides being sanctioned by 
custom, is also proper upon general grounds. Upon this point, it 
seems sufficient to add to the above observations, that inferring the 
utility of local Floras from their frequent occurrence, and, moreover, 
considering the remarkable variety and extent of our botanical sta- 
tions, no one, it is probable, will contend that a Flora of this quar- 



VI PREFACE. 

ter is improper or unnecessary ; and that the North-east of Scot- 
land is either so defective in materials, or so uninteresting to 
readers, that it deserves to remain undescribed, and to the public 
in general, botanically unknown. No doubt, the alpine parts of 
the North are occasionally referred to in the Scottish Floras of 
Lightfoot and Hooker, as well as in various publications of the 
same kind, pertaining to Britain in general. Valuable lists, too, 
of our rarer species are to be found in the Edinburgh New Phi' 
losophical Journal, as well as in Anderson s Guide to the Highlands ; 
nor ought it to be forgotten, that a copious catalogue of the plants 
of Forfarshire, by Mr. George Don, is given in Headrick's Survey 
of that county. These considerations, however, in no degree, prevent 
or discourage an attempt like the present. Indeed, in one re- 
spect, they ought rather to have the contrary effect, namely by 
multiplying the sources from which the publication is to be derived. 

The tract of country which is at present in view, may be supposed 
to be separated from the rest of the island, by an irregular boundary 
stretching from the Forfarshire coast on the east, to that of Suther- 
land on the west ; and may, in a general way, be said to consist of 
that portion of the East and Interior of Scotland, which lies to the 
north of Montrose, in addition to the western part of the county of 
Sutherland. This district may be considered as consisting of two 
great promontories, each making a degree of approach to the penin- 
sular form â€” one of these a large, and, for the most part, a rather level 
district; the other, mainly, a rugged alpine region. Though it is, 
therefore, to be understood, that no profession is strictly made of 
the present publication reaching beyond Montrose ; yet frequent refer- 
ences are made to situations still farther to the south, and an ex- 
pectation has sometimes been indulged, that with the aid of a little 
supplementary matter, which, on various accounts, it may be found 
necessary to give at the conclusion, this Flora will be found to 
suit any part of the East of Scotland northward of Dundee. 

The object, in short, has been to offer an account of the native 
vegetation of the tract referred to, which might afford to those resid- 
ing within it, the means of acquiring a knowledge of the native 
plants they may expect to find, without the evident and well-known 
inconvenience arising from the extraneous matter, occurring, of 
necessity, in Works of a more general character ; while, at the 
same time, a knowledge of our indigenous species might be impart- 
ed to others at a distance, who mav be interested in such matters. 



PREFACE. Vll 

The method which has heen followed may, as a whole, be con- 
sidered new, and is therefore deserving of a brief explanation. In the 
first place it may, without technical language, be observed regarding 
the present descriptions of plants, that â€” in place of theusual method, 
wherein the strict characters of species are succeeded by a detailed 
account, or at least by any supplementary matter which appears neces- 
sary â€” it has been endeavoured, in one brief description, to combine the 
characters necessary for distinguishing the species from one another, 
with any other points which may be deemed useful or interesting. 
There is also for the most part a paragraph, entitled " Observa- 
tions," annexed to each genus, wherein the more tangible points of 
difference among its species are noticed, along with any other remarks 
appearing to deserve attention, which may have suggested themselves. 
And when the genus is long, it is subdivided into sections or groups, 
each of which is followed by the observations alluded to. It may 
also be mentioned that, when the name made use of by Linnaeus, 
or in the more common of our British Works, differs from the 
specific appellation which the author has adopted, the correspond- 
ing synonym is mentioned. 

It is also necessary to say a few words regarding the stations of 
plants; that the manner in which this part of the subject has been 
treated, may be understood. The general statement attached to each 
species, regarding the nature of its place of growth and the fre- 
quency of its occurrence, is usually succeeded, in the same para- 
graph, by particular stations, accompanied by no observer's name. 
For these the author is entirely responsible. This is immediately 
followed by a separate paragraph, containing the observations of 
friends ; and it is, in general, to be understood that these communi- 
cations have been made to the author, and not before published ; but 
it ought to be kept in view, that it is not always to be inferred, that 
the individual communicating a plant was the original observer of it 
in the station specified. Farther, it must be explained that, when 
the individual's name is in Italics, the information has been accom- 
panied by one or more specimens ; but that, in other cases, it was 
not so corroborated. It may be added that, in the comparatively 
few instances in which the localities are derived from books, the name 
of the Work is invariably quoted. 

Particular localities of the less common plants are always given ; 
and in the vicinity of Aberdeen, the places of growth of almost every 
species, whether rare or not, are regularly indicated. Indeed, in the 



Vlll PREFACE. 

author's own observations, he has usually commenced with plants 
growing in the neighbourhood of this city, proceeding afterwards 
in various directions, according to circumstances ; while the stations 
communicated by others are arranged in a series, extending more 
or less regularly from South to North. 

It is unnecessary to mention at present all those who have fa- 
voured me with information, particularly as their names accom- 
pany the respective communications ; but a few may be alluded to, 
on account of the superior magnitude and importance of their con- 
tributions. 

The mountains of Angus are so rich in vegetable treasures, that 
no apology is necessary, if some deviation should have taken place 
from the regular bounding line, for the purpose of including this 
tract, which the discoveries of George Don, confirmed and extended 
as they have recently been, have rendered so famous in Scottish 
Botany ; and it is with much satisfaction, that copious stations of 
the more interesting species growing in this celebrated alpine dis- 
trict are inserted. These are almost all due, as well as other 
information, to a friend in Edinburgh, with whom these pursuits 
made me first acquainted in the wilds of Sutherland ; whose pro- 
gress in scientific and professional knowledge has justified my 
early opinion and expectations. 

It is also proper to direct attention to the notices, general and 
particular, of the counties of Elgin and Nairn, derived from a gen- 
tleman residing in that district ; who, however, I feel bound to men- 
tion, pointedly attributes much of the merit of his communication, 
to the Rev. George Gordon.* 

A particular acknowledgment is also due to one already well 
known by his writings on botanical Geography, who, soon after 
the announcement of the present undertaking, kindly favoured me 
with his " Outlines of the Geographical Distribution of British Plants" 
(printed for private distribution) â€” along with not a little supple- 

* In all cases where the term "Moray," or "Province of Moray," occurs in 
Part I.j the information, though not always acknowledged, is derived from the above 
source, and refers to the counties mentioned. This district is defined as follows, in 
Shaw's History of tlie Province of Moray: â€” "I include within the Province,, 
all the plain country by the seaside, from the mouth of the river Spey to the river 
Farar or Bcaulic, at the head of the Frith, and all the valleys, glens, and straths, 
situated betwixt the Grampian Mountains, south of Badenoch, and the Frith 
of Moray, which discharge rivers into that Frith."

mentary matter in manuscript, which has been frequently referred 
to in these sheets, and, so far as is known, not previously given to 
the public. The altitude to which many species ascend upon our 
northern mountains will be deemed an interesting feature of this 
publication ; and it maybe perceived that this information is entirely 
due to the laborious and useful observations of the gentleman in view. 
To the Professor of Botany in Edinburgh, I must also allude ; 
and I am the more anxious to do so, that the plan pursued has pre- 
vented me from mentioning his name, in instances wherein the in- 
formation has been derived from his writings. But there is now an 
opportunity of compensating for this, by one general acknowledge- 
ment, that all the information extracted from the Edinburgh New 
Philosophical Journal is properly due to this gentleman. Indeed, 
with a knowledge of the successful investigations carried on, within 
the few years past, in the mountains of Forfar, Aberdeen, and 
Sutherland (to which the extracts alluded to, relate), it may be 
safely asserted, that there are but few individuals whose merit in 
practical Botany will bear a comparison with that of Dr. Graham. 

There is yet another to be here mentioned, who has been num- 
bered with the dead for more than half a century ; and I feel a 
sincere wish to do justice to his memory, particularly as the grave 
in which he was laid seems to have closed, as it were, over his 
merit ; and he may be said to have gone down to dust without 
leaving that enduring name, which might have been well expected 
from the laborious and ardent career of one, whose society and 
correspondence were courted by some of the most distinguished men 
of his time, both at home and abroad. 

Not many months ago, from the kindness of a friend, a mass 
of papers accidentally came into my hands, which had formerly been 
in the possession of the late Rev. Dr. Alexander Smith, Chapel 
of Garioch, an individual, of much literary and scientific merit. 
Part of these â€” consisting chiefly of old letters, with botanical 
observations written upon them and on other loose papers by 
their original owner ; as well as a continuous set of descriptions 
of many indigenous species, arranged according to the system of 
Linnaeus â€” proved to have once belonged to Dr. David Skene, a 
physician in Aberdeen. These came into my possession too late for 
properly availing myself of them at present, beyond some localities 
of plants which have been invariably acknowledged, Enough, how- 



X PREFACE. 

ever, was seen to produce a desire for farther information, and the 
result of the inquiries is interesting enough for being now mention- 
ed ; particularly as it is hoped that the subsequent Parts of this 
publication may be farther benefited by the writings referred to. 

Dr. David Skene â€” after a short time of study at Paris, in addition 
to the more ordinary preparations â€” settled as a medical practi- 
tioner in Aberdeen, where his father and grandfather had been 
physicians of reputation ; and he soon became eminent in his own 
profession, as well as in literature and science. To Botany be 
was particularly devoted ; and he frequently herborized in company 
with Principal Campbell and Dr. Reid, who were both fully 
aware of his merits. The former is said to have often lamented that 
his observations on plants had never been given to the world ; 
while Dr. Reid, in a letter addressed to him, observes, regard- 
ing his extensive acquirements â€” " But is it all to die with you, 
and to be buried in your grave ? This, my dear Sir, ought not to 
be. Stultum est periturce parcere chartce. Can you find no time 
either when you are laid up in the gout, or when the rest of 
the world is in good health, to bequeath something to posterity ? 
Think seriously of this." I find the same distinguished philosopher, 
in another of his letters from Glasgow, urging this physician to pre- 
sent himself as a candidate for one of the medical chairs of that place, 
about to become vacant by the removal of Dr. Black to Edinburgh ; 
particularly as this might become a step towards the University of 
Edinburgh, to which Dr. Reid thought his ambition should extend. 
Nor was this a mere partiality derived from previous personal in- 
timacy ; for more than one seem to have been anxious that the 
Scottish metropolis should become Dr. D. Skene's place of abode. 
Thus, Lord Kames, a frequent and attached correspondent, says, 
in one of his letters (dated, Blair Drummond, 11th January, 1769), 
" I have a most hearty resentment at you for refusing the offer made 
you by Dr. Hope, which would have settled you in the town of 
Edinburgh, much to your profit I am certain ; but no particulars 
till I see you in the Harvest circuit ;" and in another, " I wish 
from my heart to have you settled here, and cannot but regret a 
good opportunity you missed." Dr. S. also received many letters 
from Mr. Pennant and Mr. Ellis, well known authors of that day, 
who mention his observations in their Works. I have also remarked 
a letter to him, from the late Dr. Walker, Professor of Natural 
History at Edinburgh (dated Moffat, 14th April, 1770), who, though 



PREFACE. XI 

personally unknown, wrote to procure his opinion regarding a list 
of plants which it is probahle may be subsequently referred to in this 
publication.* 

It is yet to be mentioned that Dr. D. Skene had the honour 
of corresponding with Linnaeus, several of whose letters are pre- 
served; and these being, doubtless, in his own handwriting, a few 
imitated lines from two of them, which have been inserted in another 
place, may gratify curiosity, and, moreover, indicate the degree of 
respect in which our countryman was held by that illustrious indivi- 
dual. 

I have had an opportunity of seeing the following manu- 
scripts, by Dr. D. Skene : â€” a volume of more than 360 pages upon 
Chemistry â€” another volume on Zoology â€” two 4to. vols, of papers 
read before a Society in Aberdeen â€” and many papers upon various 
medical subjects. His botanical writings have been already referred 
to ; and I can remember evidence among them that he had made a 
collection of dried plants. Indeed, his museum, consisting of plants, 
minerals, and shells, might, it is said, have well been called im- 
mense ; taking into account his extensive professional avocations, 
as well as the brief period in which it was formed. 

It remains to be mentioned that Dr. D. Skene, according to my 
information, was cut off by gout, in December 1771, at the age of 
thirty- six. I shall only add, that if any farther apology is necessary 
for this detail, it will partly be found in a sincere wish to rescue 
from oblivion, probably as extraordinary a man as the North of 
Scotland ever produced. Aberdeen has been sometimes thought 
ready enough to boast of individuals to whom its claim is not so 
unequivocal ; while the name of David Skene â€” born and bred, living 
and dying in this place â€” is never mentioned; and he may be said, 
even in his native city, to be entirely forgotten and unknown. f 

* li I have been long employed," says Dr. W. " in collecting our Scotch plants, 
and have sent you a list of some which have hitherto eluded all my inquiries. If 
they grow in Scotland at all, I am persuaded they are among the rarest plants we 
have, and it would give me great pleasure to know if any of them have fallen in 
your way in the North." 

â€¢f In addition to* the source already referred to, the greater part of these facts 
is due to the liberal kindness of a gentleman residing in the vicinity of Aberdeen, 
the nearest male relative of Dr. D. Skene ; though I am indebted for a portion of 
the information to a clergyman in this neighbourhood, who is also nearly con- 
nected to the subject of it. I may be permitted here to notice, that it seems highly 
probable to me, that Dr. D. S, (though he was in error regarding the names) 



Xll PREFACE. 

Notwithstanding' the assistance of which I have thus had the advanÂ« 
tage, there can be no doubt that these pages will, with reason, be con- 
sidered susceptible of many improvements. This will excite no sur- 
prise in those who are acquainted with the difficulty of such matters ; 
by whom it will be readily admitted, that partly to collect in person 
and partly to procure from others, the specimens and the information 
necessary for the illustration of a tract like the northern counties of 
Britain ; and to mould this information for the first time into a writ- 
ten form, which shall have even but a small degree of pretension 
to being accurate and complete â€” is an undertaking not of the very 
lightest description. To enlarge, however, upon this topic, is nei- 
ther pleasant nor j udicious. If a writer, meaning to prefer any de- 
gree of claim to an adequate elucidation of his subject, should, at 
the same time, studiously set forth the magnitude of the undertak- 
ing â€” this will appear only in the light of an idle boast ; while the 
admission of unusual difficulties, without his being able to show the 
possession of any extraordinary fitness for surmounting them, or 
any peculiar facilities towards the execution of his task, will be apt 
to suggest errors, which might, perhaps, have been concealed, and 
deficiencies which might otherwise have been overlooked. 

In the present case, no peculiar advantages of that sort can be 
boasted of ; for it may be lawful to say, that this is not the work of 
an individual able to devote his time and attention to the present sub- 
ject alone â€” as, doubtless, it would have well deserved â€” but of one who, 
speaking to the very letter, first botanically examined a plant within 
the northern counties, upon the very day on which he commenced the 



had detected, in Aberdeenshire, both Carex incurva and Rhodiola rosea ; the for- 
mer of which was not then known to be a native of Britain, while it is only 
a few years ago that the author published, as a discovery of his own, the exist- 
ence, upon the Buchan coast, of Rhodiola rosea, which, in Scotland, had previ- 
ously been supposed to be confined to alpine situations. This is at present men- 
tioned, partly to create an opportunity for requesting particular attention to the 
coast alluded to; as one reason for which it may be mentioned, that in the tract ex- 
tending from Peterhead to Banff, two or more localities have of late been ob- 
served for each of the following unexpected species: â€” Rhodiola rosea, Scilla verna, 
and Saxifraga opposiiofolia. I have recent accounts, too, though not yet com- 
pletely verified, of another Saxifrage, still more exclusively confined to the moun- 
tains, having been detected upon the same coast. This interesting tract, it may 
be added is one of the chief British stations for Juncus Ballicus; and there is some 
reason to think that this species was there noticed, for the first time in Britain, by 
a surgeon residing in that district, a persevering and meritorious follower of practical 
Botany. 



PREFACE. XI 11 

duties of active life, and who has ever since, with the exception of one 
short interval, heen incessantly engaged with business and pursuits of 
other kinds ; although it may be added that he has never lost sight 
of the present subject, nor missed any opportunity in the course of 
journeys, accidental or professional or made for botanical purposes, 
of extending his knowledge of indigenous species. I am aware that 
no apology would be valid, if a work should be voluntarily offered 
to the public for which the author is upon any account unsuited ; yet 
it may, in the present case, be some excuse for imperfections to know, 
that, with the exception of the acknowledged communication of the 
stations of plants, these pages, such as they are, were constructed 
without assistance or advice â€” though, perhaps, no kind of publica- 
tion stands more in need of such aid ; and that, within the wide 
bounds of the North, very few could be named less favourably si- 
tuate for illustrating its vegetable productions than he who has un- 
dertaken to do so. And if the deficiencies should be considered 
numerous and important, the author may derive some consolation 
from reflecting, that he has only failed in an undertaking, which, 
perhaps, no other could have executed in u perfectly satisfactory 
manner. 

I am aware that various objections will readily suggest them- 
selves, even to those who are by no means anxious to view these 
pages with censorious eyes. There is, perhaps, no point upon which 
criticism is more likely to fasten, than upon the descriptions. To 
have violated the mode of describing species, so long almost uni- 
versally admired and adopted, will, doubtless, excite general dis- 
approbation ; but there is nearly an equal confidence that the mode 
which has been followed will, on a practical trial, be deemed both 
agreeable and useful. 

It is also probable, that the district which has been selected 
will be considered vague and ill defined ; and, no doubt, the ob- 
jection would be of importance, were Nature, in her vegetable 
productions, materially influenced by any precise bounding line ; 
but no such lines of demarcation exist, and thus an obvious 
natural boundary becomes comparatively unimportant. It would 
little interest the public to know how limited is the tract which 
the author originally contemplated ; or how humble the intentions 
which have gradually expanded into the present undertaking. 
The only cpiestion upon this point, which possesses any general 
interest is â€” whether or not the district ultimately fixed upon (in 
point of fact perhaps determined by the state of the author's 
knowledge, and by the nature of communications from others 



XIV PREFACE. 

which happened to come into his possession, fully more than by any 
other circumstance) is one which is suitable to the present purpose ? 
Upon this head, it is enough to say, as before hinted, that an account 
of the vegetable productions of the northern counties, while it serves 
the ordinary purposes of a local Flora, will, it is presumed, at the 
same time, tend to fill up a hiatus in the Botany of Britain. How 
far this district â€” in point of what may be called capabilities for a 
Flora â€” may bear advantageous comparison with the other parts of 
the island, is a question which but few will easily determine until 
this publication is completed ; and it is one upon which it may not 
become the author to offer an opinion. Yet, as the answer can im- 
ply no personal merit, he will venture to inquire what other alpine 
tract, equally extensive and difficult of access, has been so com- 
pletely explored as the mountains of Angus, Aberdeen, and Suther- 
land, and has been discovered to contain so great a number of in- 
teresting vegetable products ? 

It will, moreover, be supposed that, in seeking for words which 
may be simple and easily understood, I have lapsed into language 
which is vague and indefinite. I cannot, however, perceive that plain- 
ness ought always to be sacrificed to precision ; or that, by the use of 
epithets which can be defined with mathematical exactness, much 
is gained in the frequent instances, wherein there is no exact uni- 
formity in the vegetable form or appearance to be described ; and 
when, perhaps, no one of its phases entirely accords with the idea, 
however precise, that is attached to the term made use of. 

Some may also think that too much attention has been here paid 
to mere species, and too little to the wider relations subsisting in the 
vegetable kingdom. Upon this point it may be enough, that the 
author has only proposed to describe the species growing in the 
North and East of Scotland, and to give an account of their properties 
and places of growth ; and it is requested that these objects be kept 
in view, by readers who shall discover many collateral matters 
which might have been advantageously introduced. He may, how- 
ever, bring to recollection the assurance of Sir W. J. Hooker â€” 
" that, in plants taken individually and in an isolated manner, there 
are subjects that will give ample scope for the employment of the 
talents of the greatest philosophers." Nor should it be forgotten, 
that an accurate and extensive knowledge of species is the only true 
origin of those wider views already alluded to ; which, though highly 
interesting, and doubtless requiring a deep insight into the vegetable 
kingdom, are yet but creations of the mind, sometimes resting upon 



PREFACE. XV 

no solid foundation ; while species and even geneva are in all cases 
stamped as the undoubted work of Nature's own hand. 

In the last place, it may occur to many, that a view of the rocky 
surface of the tract under consideration, sometimes attached to local 
Floras, would have been an important and interesting addition to 
the present publication ; but the author is ready to confess himself 
not possessed of the means of furnishing any such account in a 
satisfactory manner. This, however, will be but little regretted by 
those who believe with him that rocks, generally speaking, have 
little influence upon the vegetable species which grow over them. 
There was at one time an intention of inserting the reasons form- 
erly given by the author for this conclusion â€” that the knowledge of 
the opinion might be thus extended, and the question submitted to 
farther examination â€” but these sheets having been already retarded 
long beyond the expected time, he must content himself with re- 
ferring to Papers which he published in the Edinburgh Philosophi- 
cal Journal for July, 1831, and in the Magazine of Natural History, 
Vol. vi. p. 335. 

There are yet, however, a few desultory observations to be intro- 
duced. It may, in the first place, without claiming any higher 
merit, be observed, that there has been, throughout, a sincere wish 
for rigid fidelity, both in the descriptions and localities. With ex- 
ceptions of the most trifling amount, not a plant has been described 
without a specimen before me (generally gathered with my own 
hand) j. which had grown in the tract to which these sheets relate ; 
and it may not be amiss to add that the habitats depending upon 
my own authority, have been introduced, not from recollection, but 
invariably from memorandums made at the time of observation. 
The present opportunity may be taken to explain that the com- 
munications which are here styled Anonymous may be relied upon 
with nearly equal certainty as the rest ; since the meaning simply is, 
that the information, designed as above, has come either from per- 
sons who have requested that they should not be mentioned ; or from 
individuals whose names are not, with certainty, known to the author. 
It may be added, that the same method has been followed in these 
cases as in others ; that is, Italics have been used only when speci- 
mens accompanied the information.* It is right also to say that, 

* Perhaps, Italics are more thinly sprinkled through these pages than, upon the 
principle formerly explained, they ought to have been. For instance, owing to an 
error of this kind, it would seem (though erroneously) that Dr. Balfour's stations for 
Alopecimis pratensis and Phleum prafe?ise had not been accompanied by specimens. 



XVI PREFACE. 

when the communication of stations has not been accompanied by 
specimens, the utmost pains have been taken â€” as some of my cor- 
respondents well know â€” to assure myself that the statement is ac- 
curate. 

Let it be remembered that more anxiety has been felt to make 
these pages an accurate register of our veritable natives, than to 
swell the list with doubtful species or even to discover plants or 
stations which no one had hitherto observed ; and that the main 
object has been to indicate with accuracy the comparative fre- 
quency of plants whether common or not ; and to specify stations 
of the more interesting and rare species. To these considerations 
all other things are to be deemed more or less subordinate. 
No little pains have been taken to exclude species having no solid 
pretensions to a place among our natives. In matters of this sort, 
every thing will depend upon the judgment and experience of the 
observer ; as it cannot be possible to give, in each particular 
case, reasons why species are inserted or omitted, so as to enable the 
reader to determine the question for himself. Upon this point, it 
seems almost impossible to lay down any rule which shall not be 
liable to numerous exceptions. I have sometimes, however, thought 
that, in the construction of Floras, it would not be amiss to adopt the 
following view â€” whether original or borrowed I cannot exactly tell 
â€” namely, to include only the species which are considered to have 
dropped from the hand of Nature ; along with those which, though 
introduced from other sources, are now so established that they 
would continue to grow and to propagate themselves, though 
man and animals should be withdrawn from the region, and all 
artificial operations were also to cease. 

It is hoped that for the most part the general statement regard- 
ing each species will apply â€” with a few exceptions, chiefly depend- 
ing upon alpine and maritime localities â€” not only to the North- 
east of Scotland viewed collectively, but to every county, dis- 
trict, and parish, within it. Some of the original expectations and 
intentions, however, it has been found necessary to relinquish. Thus, 
the hope was contemplated of being able to make journeys, when 
necessary, to rectify, confirm, or increase, my knowledge of plants 
and localities ; and there was, in particular, an intention to make 
efforts to extract something of value, more frequently than has in re- 
ality been done, from the statements of old authors regarding the pro- 
perties of vegetables, salutary and deleterious ; particularly as it was 
thought that chemical qualities, as well as botanical affinities, might

be brought to have a bearing upon the question. But these proved 
to be visionary schemes ; for (adopting words which are suitable, 
though originally used in very different circumstances) " I soon 
found that it is too late to look for instruments when tbe work 
presses for execution, and that, whatever abilities I had brought to 
my task, with those I must finally perform it. To deliberate when- 
ever I doubted, to inquire whenever I was ignorant, would have 
protracted the undertaking without end, and, perhaps, without much 
improvement." 

The intention of compensating for unavoidable deficiencies, by 
means of a Supplement, has been already noticed. It is, indeed, 
almost certain that some errors will have crept in ; as I cannot feel 
myself entitled to hope, that in no instance has any of our northern 
species deceived me or escaped notice.

It is expected that the remainder of the Flowering Flants and 
Ferns will be comprehended in two other Parts similar to the pre- 
sent, though, perhaps, more condensed ; the whole being adapted 
for forming one volume. It only remains that I refer to the Ap- 
pendix, by two esteemed friends, consisting of â€” 1. Notes from the

* As a remarkable proof of how apt plants are to be overlooked, it may be noticed 
that the conspicuous Osmunda regalis, not previously known to me as a native of 
the North-east, was, in the course of last summer, observed in several places in 
the vicinity of Aberdeen.

bears a cluster of three flowers on two opposite sides.

2 SALICORNIA. [MOXANDRIA. 

Observations. â€” The genus Salicornia is easily detected by the 
peculiar nature of its leafless, jointed, fleshy plants, which bear in- 
conspicuous flowers, and abound with a saline juice ; but regarding its 
species some difficulty will occasionally be experienced. As I have no 
knowledge of S. radicans, it is here described in the words of Dr. 
Hooker, who says, " this scarcely differs from the preceding, except 
in its more branching, straggling, and perennial stem, quite woody 
below, often growing at the edge of a low muddy bank, and depending 
from it." It is, indeed, at present introduced, entirely on the authority 
of the Flora Scotica ; in which, no doubt, the name of a competent 
judge is given for the observation that it grows at Montrose. It 
must, however, be observed, that Mr. D. White, surgeon, who 
has carefully attended to the genus, evidently leans to the opinion 
that, properly, but one species of Salicornia occurs in that quarter ; 
although the variations in structure and manner of growth are con- 
siderable, probably owing, in a great measure, as Mr. White thinks, 
to differences of the degree in which the plants are exposed to the 
influence of the tide. 

It deserves to be added, that it appears, from a brief memo- 
randum by Dr. David Skene, regarding a journey in which his 
companion was probably the author of the " Inquiry into the Human 
Mind," that, about three quarters of a century ago, Glasswort grew, 
as it does now, in the vicinity of Ythan mouth, where it was then 
associated with another plant, with which it is mixed in that sta- 
tion to the present day. His words are : â€” " I took a ride with Mr. 
Reid as far as Slains. * * * Returning to Aberdeen by the 
water side, I found two plants new to me in the sand, within the 
flood-mark on each side of Aithan â€” the Salicornia and Chenopo- 
dium maritimum." 

The name Salicornia is derived from sal, salt, and cornu, a horn, 
on account of the horn-like appearance of the plants and the saline 
juice which they contain. 

When the species of Salicornia are burnt, the ashes con- 
tain a large quantity of soda, an article which, besides other 
purposes, is much used in the formation of glass ; whence 
the English name, Glasswort. I am not aware that in any 
part of Britain these plants are found in such quantity as to 
be a matter of practical importance ; but, in the south of 
Europe and north of Africa, they grow naturally in great 
abundance, and in Spain they are cultivated in the salt 
marshes, for the sake of the soda which they furnish. It is 
said that attempts have been made to cultivate them in in- 
land situations, but it was found that, instead of producing 
soda, they then only contained potass. Soda is procured by 
the combustion of some other vegetable species, but the 
barilla thus obtained is far less valuable than that from the 
genus Salicornia, as it contains a much smaller proportion 
of soda. 



MONANDRIA-] HIPPURIS. 6 

English writers on botany, from the old herbalists to the 
most modern, mention that Salicornia herbacea is sometimes 
pickled, forming a bad substitute for Crithmum maritimum, 
the true Samphire â€” a totally different plant, alluded to in 
" King Lear" : 

" half-way down 

Hangs one that gathers samphire ; dreadful trade!" â€” 

which is unknown in the east of Scotland, but not uncom- 
mon on rocky parts of the English coast. 

GENUS II. HIPPURIS. 

Calyx forming a very slight border to the germen. Co- 
rolla none. Stigma one, acute. Seed oval, inferior, 
naked. 

SPECIES. 

1. Hippuris vulgaris. Mare's Tail. 

Root creeping. Stem erect, polished, jointed, many inches 
above the water, supporting numerous whorls of eight or 
more linear leaves, which have callous whitish points. 
Flowers seated close to the stem, immediately above the 
leaves. 

Stagnant water, especially in peat-pits ; not uncommon. â€” Near 
Aberdeen, in the mosses at Ferryhill, Scotstown, and Brediach. 
Various parts of the same county, as in the peat-holes between 
the Tillyfourie toll and Tough ; Alford, at Balfluig ; also, Towie, 
Lumphanan, &c. ; and in Buchan, at Aberdour.

land, No. VIII. â€” In Moray, not rare. Mr. Stables. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” This species is remarkable for the flowers being arranged 
like rings around the stem, one at the base of every leaf; so that the 
flowers and leaves are the same in number. It may be added, that 
the stamen is sometimes wanting, and the nuts which succeed the 
flowers are usually most perfect towards the middle of the plant ; 
also, that the stem, though with us undivided, is, on the Continent, 
sometimes branched in the more vigorous specimens. Hippuris 
vulgaris is sometimes stated to be less common in Scotland than in 
England. I can only say that it is far from rare in the tract to 

a 2

which these observations refer ; while it is reckoned a scarce plant 
in some parts of England, and in Devonshire it is understood 
never to have been observed. Mr. Hewett C. Watson observes, 
that the southern limit of this species, in Europe, seems to be 44Â°. 
The name is derived from 'nnros, a horse, and 'ovpa, a tail ; being 
of similar import to Equisetum, the name of a cryptogamous genus to 
which Hippuris has an apparent resemblance. It has also been 
likened to a little pine growing in water, and hence the French call 
it Pesse d'eau. 

Hippuris vulgaris is said to possess slightly astringent 
qualities, and is sometimes used by country people as a tea, 
in a relaxed state of the bowels.

Observations. â€” It may be noticed that the flowers sometimes 
want the stamens, and appear rather before the leaves. The wood 
is white and tough. 

It is unnecessary to enumerate the various common uses 
to which the straight-grained and rather light timber of the 
ash is put. The bark has been supposed to possess the pro- 
perty which physicians call febrifuge. In Sicily, and to a 
small extent even in the neighbourhood of Paris, a concrete

leaves, while those of the former species are heart-shaped, thin, and 
shining, with the margins more deeply toothed. This, however, 
is a case, like many more in Botany and other branches of know- 
ledge, wherein confidence and decision, in place of being tokens of 
extensive knowledge, indicate rather ignorance and inexperience. 
He who has seen only the extreme forms of the above species will, 
at once, pronounce them unequivocally different, but his belief may 
partake of no small doubt, if he have an opportunity of tracing the 
plants through their various varieties, and of becoming acquainted 
with the fact, that excellent observers consider them as passing into 
one another ; although others helieve them to be essentially differ- 
ent, and to continue in a garden permanently distinct. I cannot, 
from my own proper knowledge, say that more than one species of 
this genus is a native of the north, or any other part of Scotland, 
and at one time I had great doubt about inserting the 2d as one of our 
indigenous plants ; though that there is in Nature a Circsea, agreeing 
with the characters of Luteiiana, and really different from our alpina, 
I feel convinced, from having gathered such a plant in the centre of 
a large forest in the Netherlands. It will be observed above, that 
specimens of this species, from three different northern stations, 
have been inspected. The first of these is not a well-marked 
plant, and the second was found in rather suspicious ground ; but, 
upon the third, I am disposed to place reliance, as its characters 
are good, and the plant undoubtedly wild, having been gathered hy 
the noble author of the observation in a sequestered romantic val- 
ley, near the old castle of Formartin, or Gight. 

On the whole, then, though there are intermediate varieties of 
both species, which, taken singly, it is perhaps impossible to re- 
fer always to their proper places, it may be concluded that the two 
are really different, and that both do occur in the north of Scot- 
land. The 2d is, however, with us a rare native, while the 1st 
appears to be little known in the south of England, where, on the 
other hand, C. Lutetiana is said to be pretty common. 

Old writers give Enchanter' s Nightshade a place among 
the herbs considered to possess amorous qualities, although 
(as I find an English botanist complaining) they are silent 
about the manner in which it is to be applied. The genus 
is dedicated to the sorceress Circe, celebrated for her skill 
in poisonous herbs. These plants are, however, very in- 
nocuous, being probably devoid of active qualities of any 
kind, and upon this head nothing needs be added to the fol- 
lowing words of old Gerarde : â€” " There is no use of this 
herbe either in physicke or surgerie that I can reade of ; 
which hath happened by the corruption of time and the 
errour of some who have taken Mandragoras for Circsea ; in 
which errour they have still persisted unto this day, attribut- 
ing unto Circaea the vertues of Mandragoras."

SPECIES. 
* Flowers in lateral clusters or spikes. 

1. Veronica Beccabunga. Brooklime. 

Stem round, thick, more or less prostrate or floating, with 
rooting fibres at the lowest joints. Leaves in pairs, upon 
short stalks, oval, blunt, slightly serrated ; and, like the 
whole plant, deep green, smooth, shining, and juicy. Flowers 
blue, in spikes or clusters, which are upon long opposite 
stalks, springing from the base of the leaves. Bracteas nar- 
row, inconspicuous, shorter than the flower stalks. Capsules 
roundish, turgid, cloven at the summit. 

Brooks, ditches, and wet places frequent. â€” Near Aberdeen, in 
Powis' burn, Old-Town Links, and between Craiglug and the 
Bridge of Dee, &c. &c. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June, July, and August. 

2. Veronica Anagallis. Long-leaved Brooklime. 

Stem erect. Leaves lanceolate, rather long, slightly em- 
bracing the stem, more or less serrated. Flowers light blue, 
upon opposite stalks, as in the former species. 

Ditches and slow streams ; rather rare. â€” In Aberdeenshire, at 
Inverury and near Fraserburgh. Kincardineshire, near Stone- 
haven. In Sutherlandshire, but not common.

Montrose. In a ditch on the roadside between Montrose and 
Usan ; and about a quarter of a mile from the latter place, 
plentifully. Dr. Balfour. â€” Noranside, in the upper part of the 
same county. Anonymous. â€” Lake of Forfar. Mr. G. Don.

county. Rev. Mr. Cowie. â€” In Moray. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” Of these three species, the 1st is by far the most common, 
and may be readily distinguished by its creeping or floating stem, 
with the leaves broad, short, blunt, and mostly stalked. To this 
species, V. Anagallis (a rather scarce plant in many parts of Scotland, 
though in England sometimes more common than V. scutellata), 
makes an approach, but is easily detected by the erect stem, and 
long acute, somewhat embracing leaves ; while the 3d species is 
sufficiently separated from the two others, by narrower leaves, capil- 
lary reflected fruit-stalks, and most of all, by the clusters not being 
opposite. Indeed, at an advanced period, the large seed-vessels 
alone of this species are a sufficient distinction, being then likened 
to little shields ; whence comes the specific name. 

A hairy V. scutellata has been sent to me by Mr. John Proctor, from 
Glentanner, Cairnomonth, Hills of Birse, and Culmelly ; and by Mr. 
John Minto, from bogs half a mile west of the Church of Clatt. 
This variety is perhaps pretty frequent in the north, and seems 
well known upon the Continent, although some British authors 
allude to it as rare. 

It maybe added that these three plants constitute the genus Becca- 
bunga of some of the older authors, who considered them all pos- 
sessed of similar properties, and as differing both botanically and 
medicinally from the other species. 

4. Veronica officinalis. Male, or Common, Speedwell. 

Stem creeping, wiry, of variable length, and, like the 
whole plant, rough from hairs. Leaves rigid, oval, serrated, 
tapering at the base into a short stalk. Spikes long, com- 
posed of light blue, streaked flowers, whose stalks are shorter 
than the bracteas. Capsule heart-shaped.

dant between Kintore and Inverury. 

In the vicinity of Haddo House. Lord Aberdeen. â€” Banff- 
shire. Rev. Mr. Cowie. â€” Indeed, so common over all the 
north, that a detail of stations is unnecessary. Mr. H. C. 
Watson finds this species at the height of above 500 yards on the 
Forfarshire mountains, and 100 yards higher in Aberdeenshire. 
Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

5. Veronica Chamcednjs. Germander Speedwell. Wild 

Germander . 
Stem by no means erect, somewhat twisted, its hairs col- 
lected into two opposite longitudinal lines. Leaves for the 
most part stalkless, ovate, wrinkled, very deeply serrated. 
Clusters rather long, many-flowered, their stalks hairy all 
round. Corolla of a bright blue. Capsule heart-shaped, 
small, shorter than the calyx.

Obs. â€” The three preceding species have various points of simi- 
larity. The rigid, stalked, slightly serrated leaves of V. officinalis 
tapering at the base into an elliptical form, might alone separate this 
plant from the two others ; and if we add its hairiness and almost 
prostrate woody stem, this species will not be mistaken for any other 
member of the genus. V. montana, though, without any doubt, a 
distinct plant (which it is said Sherard first discovered in England, 
in Charlton wood, Kent) has certainly no little similarity to the Cha- 
meedrys, but its uniform hairiness of stem with the leaves upon stalks 
which are often about an inch long, removes all doubt between this 
species and V. Chamcedrys, which is remarkable for two hairy lines

upon the stem, and has generally the leaves quite sessile. Indeed, 
in the advanced stage, V. montana is sufficiently separated from 
almost every other species of the genus, by the large membranous 
capsule, looking like a wide border to the attached calyx. It may 
be added, that the name of this rare plant does not well suit the 
stations wherein it is usually found. 

Several years ago, Mr. James Smith, Ayrshire, met with a Vero- 
nica allied to officinalis, but differing in its small size, and entire (not 
heart-shaped) capsules. Sir James Smith, Dr. Hooker, and others, 
have adopted this under the name of V. hirsuta, as a species pre- 
viously unknown in the British Flora, or, as I believe, in any other ; 
and there was, at one time, an intention of introducing it in the 
present publication, chiefly from finding in the Herbarium of my 
deceased relative, Mr. Wm. Smith, a plant with the name in ques- 
tion attached to it, collected by him in the neighbourhood of Aber- 
deen, which sufficiently agrees with the characters attributed to 
that species, and indeed with specimens of it from the Edinburgh 
Botanic Garden. Upon paying some attention to the point, how- 
ever, it appeared highly probable that this is but an imperfect V. 
officinalis â€” in which species the young capsule proves to be always 
abrupt and entire â€” and my impression is that V. hirsuta is not a 
distinct species, and scarcely a good variety ; but probably either 
a young or starved specimen of V, officinalis,

8. Veronica alpina. Alpine Speedwell. 
Stem about four inches high, branching at the base. 
Leaves oval, sometimes slightly serrated. Flowers blue, six

gathered it on the banks of the White Water, before it enters 
Glen Dole; on the rocks in Canlochan Glen, at the head of 
Glen Isla ; in Glen Fee ; and on Craigmeskeldie, a mountain at 
the head of Lochlee. At the foot of the Loch-na-gar cliffs, 
where it is much sheltered, it flowers very late in the season.

12 VERONICA. [DIANDRIA. 

I labour under the disadvantage of not having met with either of the 
first two species contained in it, in a living state, although, through 
the kindness of friends, I have various specimens of them both 
before me. The shrubby, much branched, and reclining lower part 
of the stem, with the remarkably brilliant flowers and rather small 
leaves, will be found sufficient for distinguishing V. saxatilis. As 
to the alpina ; no one acquainted with it, in the growing state, enter- 
tains the smallest doubt that it is a well-marked species, although, 
when dry, it certainly has no small resemblance to some specimens 
of V. serpyllifolia. The more upright manner of growth of the 
former of these sufficiently separates it from the latter, and yet far- 
ther from the humifusa ; while it is rendered still more evidently dis- 
tinct from both these species, by the larger leaves, fewer flowers, and 
hairy calyx, and, perhaps most essentially of all, by the style, which, 
in this species, is short, being scarcely the length of the capsule; 
whereas in both V. serpyllifolia and humifusa it is considerably 
longer. 

Botanists usually consider the two last-named plants as the 
same ; but without being certain that they are different, it has 
been thought right to direct separate attention to V. humifusa, 
as it is a remarkable plant, which may be suspected to be a dis- 
tinct species, and is at least worthy of a place in a group whose 
members press close upon one another. Lightfoot took it for the 
real alpina ; and most persons seeing it for the first time will not be 
apt to refer it to serpyllifolia, but, like the writer of these remarks, 
may suppose it to be a species previously unknown to them. It is 
readily detected by the fine blue flowers, with the prostrate stem, 
sending out white fibres below, which take root ; and it may be 
added that, in my specimens, the leaves are rounder and more dis- 
tinctly stalked than in V. serpyllifolia. This is by no means a very 
alpine plant, being found, at Banchory, little more elevated than 
the sea, and at Glentanner, not much above the common level of 
the district. It is even met with in the neighbourhood of Paris, in 
the Bois de Boulogne. 

It may be added, that all these four species turn more or less 
black in drying, although, judging from the specimens before me, 
V. saxatilis and humifusa have this tendency rather less than the 
rest.

12. Veronica agrestis. Green Field Speedwell. 

Stem prostrate, branching at the base. Leaves upon short 
stalks, ovate, with a slight tendency to the heart-shape, 
deeply serrated, opposite below, but those above rather alter- 
nate. Flowers in the bosom of the upper leaves, their stalks 
fully equal in length to the leaves, and with a downward 
cuiwe after flowering. Capsule heart-shaped, composed of 
two large, fringed, somewhat hairy lobes. Seeds convex on 
one side, and concave on the other. 
Fields and cultivated grounds. 

Annual â€” flowering throughout the summer. 

13. Veronica hederifolia. Ivy -leaved Speedwell. 

Stem prostrate. Leaves heart-shaped, cut into lobes (which 
are usually five in number, but varying from three to seven, 
the central one far the largest), opposite or alternate, stalked, 
except near the top, where they are almost sessile, especially 
in the young state. Flowers upon stalks, springing singly 
from the base of the leaves. Segments of the calyx large, 
heart-shaped, fringed. Corolla varying from blue to white. 
Seeds wrinkled, hollow upon one side. 

Borders of fields, particularly in stony parts, near hedges, 
&c. ; but not very frequent. â€” Near Aberdeen, at Ferryhill, 
Lunatic Asylum, Old Town Links, Powder Magazine, Alford 
Place, and common in fields bordering the road to Bridge of 
Dee. Rather rare in the Valley of Alford. 

In Moray, but scarcely indigenous. Mr. Stables. 
Annual â€” flowering during the summer months. 

Obs. â€” The species in this section are considered to have solitary 
flowers, although the arrangement of these in the last plant of the 
preceding group is similar to that of the first in the present. 
The two species last described have truly solitary flowers, and may 
be distinguished from all the others by that circumstance, while 
they are readily known from one another by the remarkable lobed 
leaves of the hederifolia. The 1 1th and 12th species have been con- 
founded, owing to their similarity of name, more than to any other 
cause. It is enough to say that in V. arvensis the flowers are 
almost sessile, while in agrestis they are upon stalks which are 
fully as long as the leaves. Were any other mark required, it 
might be recollected that in the former of these species, the floral 
leaves are peculiarly narrow ; and the erect stem and compressed 
seed-vessel of this species might be compared with the prostrate 
stem and turgid lobes of the capsule in V. agrestis. As it is just 
possible, that the beginner might mistake V. arvensis, even for plants 
which are placed in some of the preceding sections, it may not be 



14 VERONICA. [DIANDIHA. 

amiss to refer to the upright stem, ovate, deeply-serrated leaves, 
and the narrow upper leaves mixed with nearly sessile flowers in 
V. arvensis, which is farther remarkable for the stem dividing- at 
the base into several branches, whereof the central one is usually 
much the tallest. 

There is a Veronica (polita) which has lately been added to the 
British Flora, akin to V. agrestis, but distinguished from it by small 
grey leaves, considerably shorter than the flower-stalk, and by acute 
calycine segments ; which, it is believed, may be occasionally met 
with in the north, but so manifestly introduced as not to be entitled 
to a separate notice in this place. It is, indeed, doubtful if V. 
agrestis is a true native â€” a suspicion which may be extended to 
V. hederifolia, though not to arvensis with the same certainty. 

On concluding this genus, it may be remarked that the present 
arrangement of the species of Veronica is not quite the same as 
that which is usually adopted. In general, the species with ter- 
minal spikes are placed first; next, those with lateral spikes, and 
lastly, the species with solitary flowers ; but in this place the two 
first of these sections are transposed. By this means we form a 
natural series, wherein the solitary flowered species immediately 
follow those with terminal spikes; a sequence recommended by the 
consideration that these two groups are so much akin, that there is 
a difference of opinion as to which of them certain species ought to 
be placed in. Thus V. arvensis is occasionally considered as belong- 
ing to the section with terminal spikes, while, on the other hand, 
V. serpyllifolia has been placed by some, among the species with 
solitary flowers. It may be farther observed, that the first section 
of the genus has been, above, divided into two parts, one consisting 
of plants mostly smooth, and the other of hairy plants ; so that we 
have four groups, each, with, perhaps, the exception of the last, 
composed of plants, all naturally allied to one another, and all dif- 
ferent from the members of any of the other groups. 

Sir James Smith says the qualities of this genus are 
insignificant. Veronica officinalis is, however, occasion- 
ally used upon the Continent in the regular practice of 
medicine, as a strengthener of the stomach, probably with 
some reason, and also as a demulcent in complaints of the 
lungs. This is The cV Europe of the French ; and it is related 
that an old Danish botanist, Simon Paulli, by name, con- 
tended it was the identical tea of China. Woodville men- 
tions that it was much recommended a century before his 
time, especially in Germany, as a substitute for tea â€” a cir- 
cumstance which he ascribes to the very high price of the 
genuine article. The following words, however, which regard 
V. officinalis, from Hill's British Herbal (1756), will show 
that cheapness was not always one of its advantages : â€”

"There was an opinion very lately that it was a cure for the 
gout, and the leaves, picked and dried, sold for three or four 
shillings a pound." V. Beccabunga has a place in the 
Edinburgh and London ' Pharmacopaeias, and it has been 
considered as improving the quality of the blood, and to be 
useful in the complaints termed scorbutic. The following 
words are from the author above referred to : â€” " A fresh 
and tender leaf of brooklime laid upon a fresh wound heals 
it without any other application. A large quantity of this 
herb put into beer while brewing gives it the virtues of an 
anti-scorbutic and sweetener of the blood in a very happy 
manner. A poultice of it boiled tender is excellent in piles." 
It is, indeed, likely that the Beccabunga eaten after the 
manner of cresses, would prove a salutary article of food ; 
nor is the suggestion regarding hemorrhoidal affections to be 
despised, but might be worth adopting in some painful and 
intractable forms of the complaint.

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” The 1st of these species is well known, being characterized 
by the purplish flower, long acute spur, and smooth scape; as the 
3d is by the thin reticulated leaves, downy scape, and small pale 
flowers, with the spur short and blunt. P. alpina may be called a 
less marked species ; but it may be separated beyond mistake from 
vulgaris, by the yellowish flower and very short blunt spur ; while it 
is readily and decisively known from P. Lusitanica, by the want of 
the downy stem, and of the network upon the leaves. It is not 
a great many years since the 3d species was known to be found 
in any part of Scotland, except the western isles. It is, however, 
more common in some parts of England, than P. vulgaris. In 
Devonshire, for instance, it appears from the Flora Devoniensis 



DIANDUIA.] PINGUECULA. 1/ 

that the last-named species is never observed ; whereas P. Lusitanica 
may be there called a common plant. Pinguicula alpina has only- 
been recently added to the British Flora, and is at present con- 
sidered exclusively confined to the stations mentioned, which are, I 
understand, all in the Black Isle. 

Having received the following information regarding the discovery 
of this species, it may be introduced, as the usual accounts are not 
entirely correct. Mr. G. Campbell Smith, Land-surveyor at Banff â€” 
who possesses an useful combination of botanical with professional 
zeal, which leads him to embrace the opportunities afforded by his 
ordinary duties, of directing some attention to the native produc- 
tions of the tracts with which he is occupied â€” first observed Pin- 
guicula alpina, in June, 1831, upon the Rosehaugh property (part 
of the Black Isle of Ross, lying between the Friths of Beauly and 
Cromarty), which he was then surveying for Sir James W. Mac- 
kenzie. Mr. Smith communicated his specimens to Mr. Gordon, 
Minister of Birnie, who visited ; the quarter mentioned during the 
same summer ; and, subsequently, other discerning botanists had 
an opportunity of inspecting the plants, gathered either by Mr. 
Gordon or Mr. Smith, but these not being closely examined, were 
merely regarded as P. Lusitanica from a new and remarkable ha- 
bitat .* The credit of ascertaining this to be a new Pinguicula is 
due to Mr. H. C. Watson, who decided it to be P. alpina of Lin- 
naeus. The distinctions of our three species, as given in the Species 
Plantarum of Linnseus, are indeed very simple, relating mainly to 
the nectary or spur, which is cylindrical in the 1st, conical in the 2d, 
and thickened at the point in the 3d. 

It has been said that the late G. Don met with P. alpina either in 
Aberdeenshire or Angus; and Lightfoot (Appendix, p. 1133.) ob- 
serves, " Pinguicula alpina is said to have been found in Orkney, 
and between Frwin and Air, in moist ground plentifully"; but these 
statements stand in need of confirmation, particularly as Lightfoot 
is not very correct regarding names in this genus, and indeed the 
same thing may be said of Linnseus himself. 

In the above species of Pinguicula the flowers and scapes have no 
little similarity; and the leaves of all are radical, rolled in at the 
margin, and more or less overspread with small crystalline bodies. 
The name of this genus is thought to come from pinguis , fat; owing 
to the greasy feel of the leaves. 

The leaves of common Butterwort have been applied to 
sore nipples. It is mentioned in the cheap and interesting 
Florigraphia Britamnca that they are put into broth by the 
common people in Wales, and taken as a cathartic f ; also, 

* It is understood that Sir James Smith also mistook for the Lusitanica, speci- 
mens of P. alpina, sent to him by Mr. Mackay, in 1794, from Sky?. 

f Since the above was written, I have met with a similar remark by Ray, who 
adduces still older authority for it. " Cambrobritanni (teste Farkinsorio) ex herba 
-syrupum conficinnt, quo seipsos pnrgant."

that the juice of the leaves coagulates milk, and may be used 
as a substitute for rennet in the manufacture of cheese. It 
is added that this property is well known among the poor 
people in the northern parts of Scotland â€” a fact with which 
I was not previously acquainted, though aware of Light- 
foot's remark, that the Lowlanders believe the leaves of this 
plant, eaten by cows, to induce a ropiness in the milk. 
From this property the herb is called Butterwort ; and Sanicle 
from sano, to cure, on account of its healing qualities. Old 
Gerarde says of the " vertues" of Pinguicula vulgaris : â€” 
" The husbandmen's wives of Yorkshire do use to anoint 
the dugs of their kine with the fat and oilous juice of the 
herbe Butterwort, when they are bitten with any venomous 
worme, or chapped, rifted, and hurt by any other means." 
We may add another property which has been attributed to 
so many bog plants, that some suspect the effect to be owing 
to the wet, unwholesome situation : â€” " They say it rots their 
sheep when, for want of other food, they eat thereof."

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 
Obs. â€” The species of this curious genus are aquatics, and, in 
the natural situation, their parts keep beautifully separate, but, on 
removal from the water, they fall together and become a shapeless 
mass. It is said that the bladders (which give the name to the 
genus â€” from utriculus, a little bladder) are at first filled with water, 
by which means the plant is kept at the bottom, until it is ready to 
flower, when the water gives place to air, and the plant rises to the 
surface. In the last stage the air disappears, the bladders become 
replenished with water, and the plant again falls to the bottom, 
where the seeds are ripened. Should the flower be met with 
(which, however, it has not been my own fortune to see, in any part 
of the tract to which this publication refers), attention to it, accord- 
ing to the marks given above, will be enough to decide the species ; 
but, independently of the flowers, it will be possible to determine 
the plant, as follows : â€” The 1st species may be always recognized 
by the large size, and by the leaves being minutely fringed and sup- 
porting the little bladders. In the 2d, the bladders are not mixed with 
the leaves, but placed upon distinct stalks, and the plant is more 
leafy, with the segments broader, and, so far as I have observed, of a 
paler green ; while the last species is known by its small size, and 
smooth leaves which support the bladder- like bodies. In this 
genus the shoots are occasionally terminated by gemmce or buds, 
having the appearance of a roundish mass of short hair or wool. 
These were at one time considered a means of propagation peculiar

to U. intermedia, but it now appears that the same green balls have 
been met with in U. minor, and I am certain that I have seen them, 
upon two occasions, in Utricularia vulgaris. It deserves to be added 
that, at the Loch of Drum, U. intermedia is mingled with Subularia 
aquatica andPWalaria globulifera, two species which are for the most 
part confined to alpine lakes. 

GENUS V. LEMNA. 

Calyx of one leaf, membranous, torn. Corolla none. 
Capsule with one seed. 

SPECIES. 

1. Lemna minor. Lesser Duckweed. 

Plant floating, stemless. Leaves of an oval shape, thick, 
juicy, fiat upon both sides, or slightly convex, often cohering 
in threes, and each sending down from its lower surface a 
root in the form of a long, single, unbranched fibre. 

Tranquil waters, common â€” as in ditches at Torry, near Aber- 
deen, &c. &c. 

Obs. â€” Though unable to say, from my own observation or informa- 
tion, that any other species of Duckweed is to be met with, I think it 
not very unlikely that some of the rest may exist in the north of 
Scotland. In some parts of the Continent, especially in the canals 
of Holland, L. trisulca and polyrrhiza may be observed floating as 
common as the minor does with us. The fructification of the Lemna 
is seldom seen. Mr. George Dickie, surgeon, a zealous and pro- 
mising observer, has, however, had the fortune to meet with L. 
minor in flower, at Ferryhill, near Aberdeen. 

" Duck's meat, mingled with fine wheaten fioure, and ap- 
plied, prevaileth much against hot swellings, as phlegmons, 
erysipelas, and the paines of the joynts." So testifies Master 
Gerarde ; and the application mentioned would no doubt 
make a safe and good application in the milder forms of Ery- 
sipelas. 

GENUS V. LYCOPUS. 

Calyx tubular, with five very deep acute teeth. Corolla 
tubular, four-cleft, with one of the segments rather 
larger than the rest, and slightly notched. Stamens 
two, distant. Seeds four, lying in the bottom of the 
permanent calyx. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Lycopus Europceus. Gipsy wort. Water Horehound. 
Stem erect, from one to two feet high, hairy, with four 
angles. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, deeply toothed, the lower

ones, especially at the base, so deeply cut as to assume the 
pinnatifid character. Above they are smaller, and each 
upper pair has at its base a dense ring of flowers, which are 
whitish, with purple dots, and hairy within. 

River sides, banks of lakes and marshy places ; rare. â€” At the 
Loch of Leys, near Upper Banchory. 

Ury. Rev. Alex. Smith. â€” In Moray, near Boath, and at Caw- 
dor. Mr. Stables. â€” Strathpeffer, between Highfield and Con- 
tin, in Ross, opposite Miryford, along with Iris Pseudacorus. 
Mr. G. C. Smith. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” This species, though pretty frecpient in England, is by no 
means common in Scotland, being unknown in many large tracts, 
both in the south and north of the kingdom. It does not appear in 
Greville's excellent Flora Edinensis, and it is said not to be in Hop- 
kirk's Flora Glottiana, nor do I observe it in Mr. G. Don's list of 
Forfarshire plants. It was pointed out to me at Banchory, in 1835, 
by my learned friend Mr. Adams, surgeon ; but from a list of plants 
observed by Hercules R. Scott, Esquire, Advocate, Edinburgh, 
with which I have been favoured, it appears that this gentleman 
had detected it in the station alluded to, several years before. 
The stamens being two in number, Lycopus Europceus is referred 
to the present class, though the botanist, finding it for the first 
time, is apt to be misled by its affinity to the Mints and other 
genera in the natural order Labiatse, and consequently, to refer 
it to the class Didynamia; in which, indeed, after all, perhaps it 
ought to be placed, especially if it is correct that the stamens are 
sometimes four. The large teeth of the leaves, extending occa- 
sionally almost to the mid-rib, are an obvious character that effec- 
tually distinguishes this species from the Mints, or any other plant 
with which it is likely to be confounded. 

Lycopus Europceus has been considered astringent and 
useful in internal bleedings ; but though allied to various 
active species, it is probably destitute of medicinal value, as 
it is of taste and smell. It contains, however, a colouring 
matter which dyes a good black ; and in more than one 
Flora, Withering is quoted for the fact that the name Gip- 
sywort is derived from this property, as the species was for- 
merly used by gypsies for staining their skin. For this, 
however, we have far older authority. Gerarde says, " some 
also think good to call it Rerba Egyptia, because they that 
feign themselves Egyptians (such as many times wander 
like vagabonds from citie to citie in Germanie and other 
places), do use with this herbe to give themselves a swart 
colour, such as the Egyptians and people of Africke are of; 
for the juice of the herb doth dye every thing of this colour." 



22 ANTIIOXANTHUM. [diandria. 

GENUS IV. CLADIUM. 

Flower scale single, concave, chaffy, mostly empty, one 
or two of the uppermost only being perfect, and single 
flowered. " Fruit or Nut with a loose external coat, 
destitute of bristles at the base." 

SPECIES. 

1. Cladium Mariscus. Prickly Twigrush. 

Schcenus Mariscus. Linn. â€” Smith's Flora Britannica. â€” Eng- 
lish Botany. 

Roots long, creeping. Stem several feet high, polished, 
round and angular at the top. Leaves long, taper-pointed, 
with fine teeth and a keel which, like their margins, is very 
rough. Spikelets roundish, rust-brown, composing a branch- 
ed panicle, which has sheathing bristle-like bracteas. 

In the moss of Restenet, formerly ; G. Don in Headrick's 
Survey, 1813. â€” In large quantity, but very sparingly in flower, 
in a marsh by the roadside, about halfway between Kylestrome 
and Batcall church. Professor Jamesons Journal, October, 
1833. 

Obs. â€” This is one of the very few instances in which I am not 
possessed of specimens found in the tract to which these observa- 
tions relate. Judging from English specimens, the spikelets may 
be said to have a similarity in appearance to those of Rhynchos- 
pora alba. The genus is, also, akin to Schcenus ; but Cladium has 
only two stamens, and its fruit is different. It is remarkable that 
the present species, which is so conspicuous that it can scarcely have 
been overlooked, has never been seen but twice or thrice in Scot- 
land ; and, indeed, it is said to be now found in the more northern 
station only, being destroyed many years ago in the vicinity of For- 
far, as well as Eriophorum alpinum, by the draining of the moss. 
In England and Ireland, however, this species is more abundant, 
and in Loudon's Magazine of Natural History, for March, 1 83 6, which 
has come into my hands while in the act of writing these lines, it is 
noticed that, in the Fens of Cambridgeshire, CladiumMamcMS covers 
hundreds of acres, to the total exclusion of all other plants. I find 
in another place, a statement that it is so abundant near Cambridge, 
as to be commonly used in that town for lighting fires. 



Order II. DIGYNIA. Two Pistils,

DIANDKIA.] ANTHOXANTHUM. 23 

SPECIES. 

1. Anthoxanthum odoratum. Sweet-scented Vernal Grass. 

Root fibrous, sending up several stems which are about a 
foot high, with one or two knots near the base. Leaves flat, 
varying much in downiness ; those on the stem two or three 
in number, short, with swelling sheaths. Flowers shortly 
stalked, forming a compact panicle or loose spike, which is 
often interrupted at the base, and becomes yellow in an ad- 
vanced stage. 

Meadows and pastures ; common. â€” On the coast of Kincar- 
dineshire, quite wild. 

Anthoxanthum odoratum has been picked by me between 2000 
and 3000 feet above the sea level, in Clova and Glen Isla. Dr. 
Balfour.â€” Mr. H. C. "Watson finds it at the height of 1050 yards 
in Aberdeenshire, and of 700 yards in Sutherland. 

Perennial â€” flowering in May and June. 

Obs. â€” Regarding the flowers of this, our only grass with two sta- 
mens, different opinions have been entertained. Externally we ob- 
serve two unequal, pointed scales, within which are two awned ones, 
of a brownish hue ; and on the inside of these, close to the stamens 
and pistils, two very small awnless scales (which have been some- 
times considered the nectary) are to be observed. The parts alluded 
to have been usually supposed to form a single flower, the most ex- 
ternal pieces being the. calyx, and the others constituting either a 
double corolla or a corolla and nectary. Our eminent botanist, 
Brown, suggested a view which has been adopted by various botan- 
ists, British and foreign ; namely, that the calyx contains in reality 
three flowers. The two brownish awned valves are then to be con- 
sidered a couple of lateral imperfect flowers, within which is a cen- 
tral perfect one, its corolla being formed by the little scales already 
referred to as the nectary. 

The name of the genus is from dvOos, a flower, and gavBos, yellow, 
from the yellowish hue of the spikes. 

Mr. Sinclair observes that this grass constitutes a part of 
pastures in almost every kind of soil, and that its chief merit 
resides in its early growth ; also, that it thrives best when 
combined with many different species, and is, therefore, a 
true permanent pasture grass. It does not, however, appear 
to be particularly liked by cattle. Anthoxanthum odoratum 
exhales, when drying, the odour of Woodruff, and is supposed 
to be the principal cause of the well-known fragrance of a 
hay field. 



24 VALERIANA. [triandiua. 

Class III. TRIANDRIA. Three stamens. 

Order I. MONOGYNIA. One Pistil. 



GENUS I. VALERIANA. 

Calyx a slight border to the germen, expanding into a 
feathery crown for the seed. Corolla of one petal, 
five-cleft, bulging at the base. Seed one ; its feathery 
crown gradually unrolled. 

SPECIES. 

1. Valeriana officinalis. Great Wild Valerian. 

Stem from two to five feet high, round, furrowed. Leaves 
pinnate, with an odd one ; the leaflets lanceolate, serrated, 
nearly uniform, those of the root leaves broader and ovate. 
Flowers in a branched head, usually reddish, but sometimes 
white. 

Banks of streams and wet places ; likewise in elevated woods 
and pastures ; rather common. â€” Near Aberdeen in many places, 
as on the banks of Dee and Don, Den of Rubislaw, &c. 

Observations. â€” Valerian, with its delicate reddish flowers and 
feathery seeds, is known almost to every one. It varies much in form 
and qualities according to the place of growth, having narrower leaves 
in dry mountainous pastures, as well as a stronger smell and more 
medicinal virtue, than when growing in low moist places. V. offici- 
nalis was long believed to be the celebrated <J>ov of Dioscorides ; but 
it is now considered that Dr. Sibthorp, in his Greek tour, ascer- 
tained this to be a mistake, and that the Phu is a different species, 
which has been called V. Dioscoridis. Greek Valerian is a totally 
different plant, viz. Polemonium cmruleum, which, notwithstanding 
the name, has no true affinity to the Valerians ; nor is it supposed 
to be a Greek plant, or known to Dioscorides. 

Cats are well known to delight in the smell of the root of 
Valerian ; and rats, it is said, have a similar partiality, which 
rat-catchers sometimes make the means of decoying them. 
Valerian is reckoned of no inconsiderable value in hysterical 
and epileptic complaints, when these depend upon an in- 
creased susceptibility of the nerves rather than upon any 
alteration of structure ; and with French authors it is even 
a greater favourite than with us in the diseases usually styled 



TRIANDIUA.] VALERIANELLA. 25 

nervous. Beyond a mitigation of the disease, Valerian produces 
no very conspicuous effects upon the system. The part made 
use of is the root, from which an infusion or tea may be pre- 
pared ; but the powder is more commonly employed. Some 
entertain doubts regarding the utility of these preparations 
of Valerian ; but I can, at least, attest the frequently excel- 
lent effects of its Ammoniated Tincture in spasmodic and ner- 
vous attacks. It does not, however, appear that recent me- 
dical observers have added much to our knowledge of Vale- 
rian, as some of the old Herbals may be said to contain the 
substance of what is to be found upon this subject in the 
works of the present day. 

GENUS II. VALERIANELLA. 

Calyx of three or four teeth, ultimately enlarged, and 
crowning the capsule. Corolla of one petal, five-cleft, 
protuberant at the base. Capsule with three cells, two 
of them usually abortive.

Stem soon dividing into two, each side of the fork repeat- 
edly splitting in a similar manner. Leaves tongue-shaped, 
the highest sessile, and toothed or jagged ; those below en- 
tire, and tapering at the base ; the radical ones being on dis- 
tinct stalks. Flowers pale blue, collected in heads, which 
have at the base bracteas resembling the leaves, though of 
a smaller size. Capsule inflated, two-lobed, smooth, with 
a minute crown of three inflexed teeth, one of them much 
the largest.

Flowers flesh-coloured ; some single in the forks, others in 
corymbs. Capsule ovate, ribbed, with a crown of three or 
four unequal teeth, one much larger than the rest. 

In the south-east part of Angus-shire (by Mr. G. M'Nab). 

Dr. Balfour. â€” Rare in Moray, and not indigenous. Fields near 

Stotfield and Coltfield, Alves. Mr. Stables. 

Annual â€” flowering in June and July. 
Obs. â€” Some difficulty has been experienced with these two species, 
partly because most of my specimens are not in a very fit state for com- 
plete examination ; but principally because they do not respectively 
well agree with the descriptions in the English Flora of Smith, upon 
which, in general, I am disposed to place the most implicit reliance. 
Thus, in the work alluded to, it is said of the 1st species, that none 
of the flowers are at the forks of the stem ; whereas there are, in my 
specimens, a few single flowers in the upper forks, and the same 
thing is to be observed in some old figures of this species. It is 
also mentioned that, in the 2d species, almost all the flowers are 
from the forks of the smooth stem ; but I observe a great part of 
the flowers not to be in the forks, or at least to be crowded into a 
capitate form, as in the 1st species; nor is the stem quite smooth, 
but with short and remote bristles, as in the olitoria. For these rea- 
sons, it is possible that some of the stations assigned to one of the 
species may, in reality, belong to the other. It may be said that 
the species differ in the former having bluish flowers, mostly in 
heads, with a globular two-lobed seed-vessel ; while in the latter, 
which is a taller plant, with narrower leaves, the purplish flowers are 
frequently in the forks, even at some distance from the summit, and 
the capsule is of a pear-shaped form. 

Lamb's Lettuce is frequently cultivated for a sallad both 
in England and on the Continent,

membranous calyx or sheath ; the inferior upon stalks. Co- 
rolla lemon-coloured, with purple or black lines ; three of its 
segments being large, external, and refiexed ; the other three 
interior, erect, and small. Stigma petal-like, larger than 
the inner segments of the corolla, fringed, and forming an 
arch over the anthers. Capsule angular, with three many- 
seeded cells. 

In marshes, and at the sides of ditches and streams ; not very 
common. â€” At Aberdeen, on the west side of the Old-Town Links ; 
Burn of Millden ; Canal above Mounthooly ; and a few miles 
southward upon the Kincardine coast. Inverury. 

Various parts of Banffshire, and occasionally throughout the 
north. Scarcely known, however, in theAlford district, though 
found in Cromar. 

Caithness and Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

There is some reason to think that the root will act upon 
the bowels and kidneys ; and toothache may be alleviated by 
chewing it and retaining the acrid juice in the mouth. Va- 
rious authors, British and foreign, say that the seeds of this 
plant have been tried as a substitute for coffee ; but they do 
not mention the result of the experiment. Lightfoot in- 
forms us that the roots of Iris Pseudacorus are used to dye 
black in Arran and some other of the western isles, and that, 
in Jura, they are boiled with copperas to make ink. 

GENUS IV. RHYNCHOSPORA. 

Flowers with a single scale, the outer barren and small. 
Spikes terminal and axillary. Bristles several. Style 
enlarged at the base, remaining so as to form a beak 
to the seed.

Stems triangular, thread-like, leafy. Leaves erect, tapering, 
narrow, channelled. The loose heads or clusters of flowers 
are level- topped ; one, two, three, or more upon each stem, 
white at first, but ultimately brownish. Bracteas of variable 
length, sometimes much longer than the clusters. Stamens 
two. Style remaining, and forming a beak to the seed, 
which is surrounded by numerous bristles. 

In boggy situations not uncommon, but chiefly in the most 
northern counties. â€” In Sutherland; on the banks of Loch Shin 
and other places. 



28 SCHCENUS. [triandria. 

Angus-shire, near Rescobie. Dr. Balfour. â€” Rare in Moray, 
found at Dyke moss, north of Brodie House. Mr. Stables. â€” 
Ross-shire. Mr. G. C. Smith. â€” In Sutherland, to the east of 
Loch Emboli. Mr. Watson. 
Obs. â€” This plant is sufficiently distinguished by its whitish 
flowers collected into loose heads, of which there are usually 
three or four upon each stem. It is remarkable for the style remain- 
ing upon the seed; whence comes the name of the genus â€” iroinpvyxos, 
a beak, and airopa, a seed. A writer in Loudon's Magazine of Na- 
tural History, for December, 1835, states that this species has 
" bristles nine to twelve, with reflexed teeth," an observation of 
some importance, as it is added that a kindred species, not, how- 
ever, hitherto found in Scotland, Schcenus fuscus of Linnaeus, has 
" bristles six, with erect teeth." In the Flora Scotica of Hooker, 
it is stated that the flowers of Rhynchospora alba are terminal and 
collected into a sort of corymbus, as long or longer than the invo- 
lucrum â€” a description with which this species, according to my 
opportunities of observing it, does not usually coincide. 

GENUS V. SCHCENUS. 

Flowers with a single scale, the outer ones small and 
barren. Spikes terminating the stem. Seed with or 
without bristles at the base. 

SPECIES. 

1. Schcenus nigricans. Black Bogrush. 
Stems in tufts, round, from ten even to twenty inches 
high, naked except at the base, which is surrounded by 
blackish sheaths ; whence arise rigid bristle-like leaves, 
shorter than the stem. Flowers collected into a single dark 
roundish head, having at its base a couple of awl-shaped 
leaves, one of them shorter, and the other in general far 
longer, than the head. Seed white, shining, pointed. Bris- 
tles, if any, small and brownish. 

In boggy places ; rather rare. â€” In wet ground, adjacent to 
Montrose, where I found it in 1828 ; but it is probably in very 
small quantity, as Mr. D. White has since searched that neigh- 
bourhood for it in vain. Banks of Loch Shin in Sutherland, 
and not uncommon on the west side of the county. Not hither- 
to observed in Kincardine or Banff. 

About seven miles from Aberdeen, in a swamp upon the east 
side of the road to Udny, near the dark, serpentine rocks ; from 
which specimens were brought to me in 1835, by Mr. John 
Henderson, who discovered it in company with Mr. A. K. 
Clarke, whose untimely death has happened when these sheets 
are about to go to press. â€” In Moray. Mr. Stables. â€” Black

Stem round, varying from a few inches to a much greater 
height ; having near the bottom two leaves which are narrow, 
smooth, grooved, but not keeled. Spike somewhat compres- 
sed, of a dark rust- brown colour, composed of from five to 
seven spikelets, which are in two ranks, with a bractea at 
the base, varying in length, and sometimes wanting. Seed 
pointed, without bristles. 

In not a few places, though Lightfoot calls it rare, but 
always, so far as I have observed, in the neighbourhood of the 
sea. â€” At Aberdeen, on the Old-Town Links, but in extremely 
small quantity. Upon the same coast, a little to the south of 
Ythan ; and in Bucban, at St. Fergus. Abundant in many parts 
of the Kincardineshire coast, especially between Stonehaven and 
Muchals. In the, neighbourhood of Cromarty. 

Common on the sea shore at Montrose, and near the basin 
there. Mr. White, surgeon.â€” Kincardineshire, at Brotherton.

â€” North of Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. â–  

Obs. â€” The dark brown sheaths at the base of the stem, and the 
round, ovate, blackish head, with its two bracteas, one short and 
the other long, indicate S. nigricans with sufficient precision. Upon 
referring just now to the Scottish Floras of Lightfoot and Hooker, 
[ have been surprised to find that in both these "Works this is 
called a common Scottish species ; but I observe that in Hooker's 
British Flora, it is more correctly stated to be rare in Scotland, unless 
upon the west coast. Except the stations now published, the only 
known Scottish habitat on the east coast, is in Fife, near the Frith of 
Forth, where I have gathered it in company with Dr. Graham, the 
discoverer, I believe, of that station for the plant. As to S. rufus, 
it is sufficiently separated from the 1st species by the dark brown, 
compressed spike, which is composed of about six spikelets, placed 
in two rows, and has usually a single leaf at its base. This leaf is 
stated by authors to be shorter than the spike, or only to equal it in 
length ; but it is certain that, in Kincardineshire, where the plants 
are luxuriant, the bractea is frequently longer than the spike, not 
seldom, indeed, twice, nay, even occasionally three times as long. 
Dr. Walker of Edinburgh is considered the original discoverer of 
this species, which was unknown to Linnaeus. Lightfoot has given 



30 SCIRPUS. [THIANDRIA. 

a figure of it upon the same plate with Carex incurva, and it is re- 
markable that these two plants grow together â€” sometimes, as it were, 
passing insensibly into one another â€” on the coast of Aberdeen and 
Kincardine. 

Should Schoenus compressus be met with in the tract to which 
these observations relate, it may be distinguished from rufus by 
its lighter brown, chesnut- coloured, and still more compressed 
spike, which, like the whole plant, is larger, the spikelets as 
well as the flowers whereof they are composed being much more 
numerous. The leaves, too, are far larger and broader ; but, in- 
deed, the long bristles at the base of the seed (distinctly to be ob- 
served, but not always included even in the most recent accounts 
of the species ; though, without attention to this point, it cannot be 
in all cases recognized) will effectually distinguish S. compressus 
from rufus, and so far as I know from every other plant with which 
it is likely to be confounded. S. compressus is a rare native of 
Scotland ; at least the author of these remarks has never seen it in 
the growing state, except once â€” which was in the South, not very 
far from the English Border. This species may, it is possible, exist 
in the north and east of Scotland, as I have got more than one ac- 
count of it occurring in the tract to which this publication relates ; 
but all the northern specimens supposed to be S. compressus which 
I have yet seen, proved to be either Carex intermedia or S. rufus. 
There are, it may be added, several common features in the follow- 
ing species: â€” S. compressus and rufus, Carex intermedia, arenaria, 
ovalis, and even incurva, all of which, except the first, are to be 
found associated a few miles to the south of Aberdeen, forming, in 
their various gradations, a study not devoid either of difficulty or 
interest. â€ž

Perennial â€” flowering in August. 

Obs. â€” The plants in this group are marked by the single spike 
at the extremity of the stem. Scirpus ccespitosus is well charac- 
terized by having at the base of the stem a mass of withered scales, 
and within these, one or more young sheaths, ending in little 
tongue-like leaves ; and farther, by the long glumes which some- 
times extend completely beyond the spike. It is not with quite so 
much ease and precision that the remaining three species are at all 
times to be distinguished from one another. Of these, the 3d is a 
well-known common plant, and, therefore, it is enough to refer to 
the tall, stout, spongy stem, and the single spike often nearly an 
inch long. With respect to the 4th species (multicaulis ) I can add 
little or nothing to the points noticed above ; but it may be observed 
that though there has been a difference of opinion upon the subject, 
it is probably a good species. Doubts, however, may be entertain- 
ed as to whether some of the preceding stations do not regard 
mere varieties of the palustris. S. pauciflorus, a species unknown 
to Linnaeus, makes sometimes a near approach in appearance to 
small specimens of S. palustris, but the two are essentially different, 
and as practical means of distinction, we have the longish spike of 
the latter species tapering at both ends into an elliptical form, to 
compare with the short, broad, and blunt spike of pauciflorus ; while 
this last-named species is distinctly separated from S. ccespitosus by 
the spike being smaller, and of a darker colour, usually twice as long 
as its outer scales, and still more evidently by the want of any thing 
like the rudiments of leaves observed in S. ccespitosus. S. pauci- 
florus is sometimes met with of very small size ; but at no time 
need it be confounded with S. acicularis, a species not known to me 
with any certainty as occurring in the north of Scotland, well cha- 
racterized by the extremely slender stem and very minute spike. It 
is to be recollected that in all the preceding species the stems are 
apt to occur without spikes, in which condition they are sometimes 
taken for leaves.

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” The present group is separated from the preceding by the 
spikes upon each stem being more than one ; and farther, by the pos- 
session of leaves, which are wanting in the first four species; as we 
cannot consider, in the light of leaves, either the barren stems of the 
first division, or the leaf-like points of the sheaths in S. ccespitosus. 

S. fluitans is detected by the stem being branched and carrying se- 
veral minute spikes, upon long stalks ; and, moreover, by being, in 
general, a floating plant. The small, greenish spikes, two or three in

number, overtopped by tbe bractea, are characters of S. setaceus ,â€¢ and 
should the spike be single, as it sometimes is, the species will not be 
supposed to belong to the first section, as its fructification has at least 
the appearance of being on the side of the stem, and not at its extre- 
mity, as in the first group. S. lacustris is recognized by the tall, 
stout, round, soft, nearly leafless stem, and rather numerous spikes; 
while S. maritimus may be discriminated by its triangular stem and 
long leaves, taken in connexion with the maritime stations in which 
it grows. At the same time, we are not certain of sea water being 
necessary to this species, as I understand it has been found, in 
England, in habitats to which the sea had no access ; and, if I recol- 
lect rightly, it occurs on the Continent under the same circum- 
stances. There is little risk of S. sylvaticus, a rare species, both 
with us and in many other parts, being mistaken for any other Scir- 
pus, as it is quite unlike them all, having the port rather of Luzula 
maxima. The stout triangular stem, with long leaves, and the hun- 
dreds of greenish spikelets, with the whitish seed surrounded by 
bristles, are unfailing marks of this species. 

It remains to be observed, that the plants at present placed under 
the genera Schoenus and Scirpus have been often arranged differently, 
by individuals of great eminence. In the latter genus, S. palustris 
and multicaulis have, of late, usually been separated from the rest, 
chiefly on account of the lower part of the style being dilated and 
continuing attached to the seed, and have been placed in Eleocharis ; 
while S. setaceus zmdfluitans, which are without bristles, enter into 
the genus Isolepis. Farther, Schcenus rvfus and compressus, have 
been considered as forming a genus styled Blysmus, chiefly dis- 
tinguished by the two-ranked compressed spike. The writer of these 
remarks has, however, thought it better to notice the characters 
referred to, in the respective specific descriptions, 'than, without 
absolute necessity, to indicate, in a local Flora, numerous genera, 
particularly when botanists are by no means quite agreed regarding 
their constituents. Superficial attention to the subject might have 
led to including Cladium Mariscus and Rhynchospora alba in the 
genus Schcenus, or to have put those two species in a genus consist- 
ing of themselves alone ; but each of these being materially differ- 
ent from any other species, it is better to separate them genericallv 
from the rest, as well as from one another. 

No doubt, it has been remarked, that to multiply genera more 
than enough is better than to fall into the opposite error, as we 
are, in that way, most likely to bring the important characters into 
a prominent light. This, though a good theory, would sometimes 
lead to inconvenience in practice ; and certainly some carry the 
principle quite far enough in this portion of the Cyperacese, when 
they place, in different genera, even Schcenus rufus and compressus, 
species so nearly allied that good botanists have occasionally failed 
in distinguishing them from one another. 

Mr, Curtis observes that the roots of Scirpus maritimus 

c 2 



36 ERIOPHORUM. [triandria. 

are very sweet, and would probably afford good and nutri- 
tious food for hogs, being larger than those of S. palustris, 
which are collected for that purpose in Sweden. Indeed, 
it is said that they have been ground and used in place of 
flour in times of scarcity. S. ccespitosus is considered ex- 
cellent early food for the hill sheep, and cattle eat the her- 
bage of S. maritimus and other species of this genus. It is 
observed, by Withering, that goats, horses, and hogs, eat 
S. palustris ; but cows and sheep refuse it. S. lacustris is 
much used for mats and chair bottoms ; also, for thatching 
cottages and filling up the spaces between the staves of casks.

2. Eriophorum vaginatum. Hare's-tail Cotton-grass. 
Root slightly creeping. Stem triangular at the top, in the 

early stage short and entirely included in swelling sheaths, of 
which, usually, the highest is leafless, the next ending in a 
short leaf, and the lowest yellow, sending up bristle-like 
leaves. These, in the early stage, are longer than the stem, 
which, however, afterwards far exceeds them, shooting up 
ultimately to a foot or two. Spike single, ovate ; the scales 
at first, of a lead colour, afterwards silver-grey. Anthers 
yellow.

Root of numerous fibres. Stem leafy, roundish, more than 
a foot high. Leaves rather long, sheathing, linear, triangu- 
lar, grooved at the base. Spikelets five or six, upon stalks 
of unequal length, and having, at the base, two or three 
leaves, one longer than the rest. Scales brown, with a pale 
edge. Hairs long, at least thrice the length of the spike. 

Bogs and muddy places ; common. â€” Near Aberdeen, at Nigg ;

Upon the mountains of Clova (850 yards high) and Braemar ; 
and in the northern part of Sutherland. Mr. Watson. â€” Ross- 
shire, where the genus is much esteemed by shepherds for afford- 
ing early pasture. Mr. J. C. Smith. 

Perennial â€” flowering in May. 

Obs. â€” This genus is well marked by the character whence comes 
the name â€” from *epiov, wool, and cpepa>, I bear. 

The single spike sufficiently separates the two first species[from 
the 3d ; and, indeed, this character may be deemed pretty con- 
clusive of the species being the 2d, as the chance against this is 
so small, that it scarcely deserves to be taken into practical ac- 
count. It is an obvious enough general rule (not, however, neces- 
sary in the present instance), that where, in consideration of the 
characters of a plant, we are equally divided between two species, 
one of which is rare and the other common, the chances are greatly 
in favour of its being the latter. It is said that the first species has 
disappeared from the neighbourhood of Forfar ; nor is it certain 
that it ever occurred in any other spot of British ground â€” a re- 
markable enough fact, considering that there is no doubt of its hav- 
ing been seen in the station alluded to, both by Mr. R. Brown and 
Mr. Geo. Don. Smith thinks it strange that so mountainous a plant 
as E. vaginatum should have been found at Croydon. It is certainly 
not an alpine species with us, but common enough throughout the 
north, usually at the ordinary level of the district. Having failed 
to meet with any many-spiked Eriophorum, differing, with certaintv, 
from E. august (folium, the writer of these remarks ventured, at one 
time, to suspect that, in Scotland, we have in reality but one species 
with several spikes ; and that the differing lengths of the hairs of the 
seed might be owing to the different stages of the plants ; but this 
conjecture rests upon no satisfactory foundation. Indeed, judging 
from the figures of Vaillant and Sowerby, E. angustifolium is abund- 
antly distinct from the polystachion. Questions, however, about the 
limits of species are more seductive than important, and I would 
say, shortly, that, as the northern botanist may pretty safelv refer 
any single-spiked Eriophorum to the vaginatum, so will he seldom 
err in considering every many-spiked species as E. angustifolium, 
though it is possible that others, especially the polystachion (cha-

racterized by broader leaves and shorter hairs), may exist in the 
tract to which this publication relates.* 

Sheep are said to be very fond of E. vaginatum, and cattle 
feed readilv upon the leaves of the E. angiistifolium, before 
other herbage is sufficiently advanced. The down of these 
plants has been used for stuffing pillows ; but it is too brittle 
for being manufactured into thread. 

GENUS VIII. NARDUS. 

Calyx wanting. Corolla of two scales, the outer largest. 
Stalk of the spike toothed. Flowers alternate, sessile, 
all turned to one side. 

SPECIES. 

1. Nardus stricta. Mat-grass. 

Root of tenacious, tortuous, downy fibres. Stems almost 
leafless, several inches high. Leaves numerous, diverging, 
and, like the stems, bristle-shaped. Spikes long, about a 
quarter of the whole plant, of a purplish hue, toothed, and 
grooved for the reception of the flowers, which are unilateral, 
the stem being terminated by one of them. Larger scale 
of the corolla terminating in an awn. 
Moist moors and woods ; common. 

Mr. H. C. Watson observed this species at the height of 1050 
vards in Aberdeenshire, and of 700 yards in Sutherland. 
Perennial â€” flowering in June. 
Obs. â€” This rigid and rather elegant grass, untouched by cattle, 
and resisting the weather, often presents a solitary and desolate as- 
pect in woods and moors, " where it forms thick tufts of rigid, rush- 
like leaves, which remain through winter ' bleaching in the northern 
blast.' " 

Smith observes that of its agricultural uses little can be 
said, for cattle, in general, refuse it ; and though mats or 
baskets might be made of it, we are supplied, from Spain, 
with better grasses for those purposes, particularly Stipa 
tenacissima. Nardus stricta is said to possess a quality 
which is of importance upon some occasions. It offers a 
safe hold to the hands of the alpine herborize^ although it 
may increase the slipperiness of his path. 



* Since the above was written, information has been received that Eriophorum 
pubescens, a sp. with downy spike-stalks, and the hairs of the seed still shorter 
than in E. polystachion, occurs in Ross-shire; but, in the absence of exact know- 
ledge as to this being a valid species, farther notice of it is deferred.

Beside a stream which falls into the west side of Loch Whorrol, 
a lake at a considerable elevation on the mountains to the north-

dantly by the side of the White Water, at a considerable distance 
above its entrance into the head of Glen Dole ; and also, on sides 
of a stream which runs from the south to join the White Water. 
In this situation it is associated with Phleum alpinmn. I have 
also gathered it in immense profusion in marshy ground between 
Clova and Loch Lee, about two miles south from the head of the 
loch ; and by the side of a rivulet on the mountains of Clova, 
south from the farm-house of Bradoony, at the upper part of 
Glen Clova ; and in marshy places at the head of Glen Callader.

40 ALOPECURUS. [TitiANDKiA. 

3. Alopecurus geniculatus. Floating Fox-tail-grass. 

Stem floating or lying on the wet ground, curved, bent at 
the joints. Leaves and sheaths similar to those of the two 
former species. Stipule oblong. Spikes cylindrical, from one 
to two inches in length, with long prominent awns. Calyx- 
scales purplish, fringed, and united at the base. 

Ditches at roadsides, slow streams, and wet places ; eommon. 
Also, occasionally upon dry spots (when the lower joints usually 
become oval and fleshy), as the Aberdeen Inch, &c. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” Of these species, it is only the 1st and 3d that the botanist 
may usually expect. The former is a taller plant, with a thicker and 
longer spike ; but, indeed, the straight and erect stem of A. pra- 
tensis sufficiently distinguishes it from A. geniculatus. The 2d spe- 
cies (alpinusj is well marked by the very hairy calyx, which gives 
a woolly or shaggy aspect to the rather short, ovate spike ; and 
though authors build a distinction upon the short upper leaf, with 
its inflated sheath, as pointed out by Mr. R. Brown, I cannot, in 
those respects, discover any essential difference between A. alpinus 
and the common species of the genus. Smith and Hooker concur 
in attributing the first observation of this species, to the distinguished 
botanist just mentioned ; but if the statement is correct, that the 
discovery was communicated by Mr. Brown to Mr. G. Don, it 
is certainly remarkable that the latter meritorious observer should 
make use of the following words, regarding A. alpinus, in Headrick's 
Survey of Forfarshire (1813) â€” " a new species, which I discovered 
many years ago." This point is worthy of notice, as there is an in- 
terest attached to the history of a species, observed for the first time 
in the world, in the tract to which this publication relates, and even 
at this day not known, with certainty (though Ben Lawers has been 
mentioned as a habitat), to occur in any other part of Europe, but 
understood to be plentiful in North America and Spitzbergen. 

It remains to be mentioned that A. agrestis cannot, with propriety, 
be introduced among the northern natives. Indeed, in all parts, 
probably, of the kingdom it is rare and not indigenous, and therefore 
it is surprising to find Lightfoot and Hooker, in their Floras of Scot- 
land, alluding to it, without even a hint of its being either uncom- 
mon or a doubtful native. In England, however, it appears to be 
common, and it is pretty frequent in some parts of the Continent. 
This species has been observed upon the Inch, at Aberdeen, proba- 
bly transported with ballast ; and though not properly indigenous, 
it may be mentioned that it is readily detected by the long, slender, 
and usually purplish spikes, with very long conspicuous awns.* 

* The spikes of this genus have hecn likened to a fox's tail ; whence its name â€” 
from d\a>Trr)Â£, a fox, and ovpn, a tail. It may be added, that though the term 
spike is made use of both here and in the genus Phleum, the inflorescence in these 
cases is, in reality, of a looser kind.

cipal part of many rich natural pastures, and that, from its 
early growth, quantity of produce, nutritive qualities, and per- 
manency, it is one of the best grasses for pasture, and should 
never form a less proportion than one-eighth of any mixture 
of different grasses, prepared for that purpose. It is said, 
however, to thrive, in perfection, only in lands of intermedi- 
ate quality, as to moisture and dryness. The seed also is 
often defective, and consequently the crop cannot be de- 
pended on. Mr. G. Don, after having cultivated Alopecurus 
alpinus for several years, was convinced that it is but little 
inferior to pratensis. 

GENUS X. PHALARIS. 

Calyx of two scales, concealing the corolla, which is 
mostly of four pieces ; the outer pair very small ; the 
inner nearly as long as the calyx, ultimately hardened 
and closely investing the seed. 

SPECIES. 

1. Phalaris arundinacea. Reed Canary-grass. 
Arundo colorata. Smith's Flora Britannica. 
Digraphis arundinacea. Lindleys Synopsis. 

Root creeping and jointed. Stem erect, from two to four 
or five feet high. Leaves harsh, ribbed, tapering to a point. 
Panicle long, with a tinge of brown or red, putting on a 
lobed appearance, and composed of crowded flowers, which 
tend to one side. Two inner scales of the corolla of a simi- 
lar length to the calyx ; the outer pair very minute and hairy. 

Margins of lakes, rivers, and small streams. â€” Near Aberdeen, 
in the vicinity of the bridges of Dee and Don. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” At one time the minute outer pieces of the corolla were 
considered a tuft of hairs, and the plant was, in consequence, placed 
in the genus Arundo ; and it may be added that some view these 
parts as belonging to an imperfect flower. A variety of the present 
species, with variegated leaves, is common in gardens, where it is 
called Riband-grass or Gardener's Garter, and it has been met 
with at a little island, called Handa, on the coast of Sutherland. 
Canary-grass belongs to this genus, and is distinguished by a thick, 
short, ovate spike, which is variegated with green and white ; but 
though often met with, it is so undoubtedly introduced from serving 
as a food to birds, that it does not here merit a regular description.

1. Phleum pratense. Common Cat' s-tail-grass. Timothy- 

grass. 
Root fibrous. Stem erect, leafy except at the summit, 
with very long, close, furrowed sheaths, and short stipules. 
Spike cylindrical, two or three inches long. Scales of the 
calyx with a broad abrupt membranous margin, and a firm 
green keel or nerve, prolonged into a thorn or awn, which is 
much shorter than the calyx. 

In fields and meadows; not uncommon. 
Perennial â€” flowering in June. 

2. Phleum nodosum. Knotted Cat' s-tail-grass.

Glen Fee. I have also gathered it in moist places, on the side 
of Ben-na-buird nearest to Castleton, Braemar; on Loch-na- 
gar ; and on the moist rocks at the head of Glen Callader. 
In most of these situations it is associated with Alopecurus 
alpinus. Dr. Balfour.

inches long. Scales of the calyx exactly lanceolate, not 
abrupt, with sharp, rigid, often inflexed points ; their keels 
strongly fringed. 

On the very summit of the highest mountains of Clova. Mr. 
G. Don. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July aud August. 

Obs. â€” Having no acquaintance, unless through garden specimens, 
with the last described species (which does not appear to have been 
ever gathered in Britain, unless by the individual above alluded to), 
the present account of it is extracted from the English Flora. The 
4th species is confined to the sea-side, and may be distinguished by 
the spikes being often variegated with white and red ; and, more 
particularly, by the calyx-scales being neither awned nor abrupt, but 
tapering gradually to a point. The 3d species is confined to sta- 
tions indicated by the specific name, and is best known by the long 
awns giving a remarkable, bristly appearance to the short, thick, 
purplish, almost violet spikes. In P. pratense, the long spike and 
the abrupt blunt scales of the calyx, with an awn only half or third 
of their length, are sufficiently characteristic. 

The 2d species (nodosum) is usually reckoned a variety of the^ra- 
tense ; but I have ventured upon restoring it to its present rank. My

attention was first directed to it by specimens from Mr. Craigie, sur- 
geon, formerly of Keith, now in America, which were sent under 
the name of P. alpinum. At the time of receiving these, I dif- 
fered from my acute friend, but I soon became convinced that his 
plant makes fully as near an approach to the species which he had 
named, as to pratense. It may, indeed, be observed, that the above 
description of P. nodosum, derived from the specimens alluded to, 
as well as others, has a resemblance to that of alpinum in every re- 
spect but the shorter awn ; whence the spike is not quite so bristly. 

Has it ever occurred to any one that P. alpinum may be a mere 
mountain variety of pratense? The chief distinction resides in the 
different length of awns, which will be admitted to be but a fallaci- 
ous specific criterion ; and, in fact, various gradual differences, both 
in that respect and in the length of the spike, have been observed. 
In English specimens before me of P. pratense, the spike is longer 
and more slender, with a shorter awn than in others gathered in 
an inland Aberdeenshire district, a few hundred feet high ; while, 
in the plant above referred to as nodosum, the spike is still farther 
shortened and the awn longer, and these differences become yet 
more marked in the common specimens of P. alpinum, in which 
the spike is remarkable for being short, thick, and bristly. In 
short, it is to be suspected that the differences among Phleum pra- 
tense, nodosum, and alpinum, depend upon locality, particularly as 
the second of these proves to be intermediate, connecting, as it were, 
the two others. It may be farther said that, if P. pratense and 
alpinum are really different species, P. nodosum, as already sug- 
gested, may claim a similar rank ; but if the last is to be considered 
only a variety, it probably rather belongs to alpinum than pratense. 

Perhaps it might also be worth inquiry, whether the difference be- 
tween Alopecurus alpinus and the pratensis depends upon situation. 

Phleum pratense was once celebrated for its agricultural 
properties, but is now in less repute. It is, however, a pro- 
ductive and early grass, peculiaidy nutritive when the seed 
is ripe. It is thus well adapted for pasture or hay, but it 
must be noticed that it grows but slowly after being cut or 
cropped. In 1815, Mr. Sinclair was informed, by a Canada 
proprietor, that it is considered the best grass in that pro- 
vince. 

Gerarde attributes rather a curious quality to this grass, 
which, he says, when prepared as prescribed in his Her- 
bal, " and so eaten, is a most perfect medicine against the 
disease in children, called, in Greek, 'EvrepoKrjXr]. This being 
used, as before specified, doth not onely helpe children and 
striplings, but growne men also." If any should avail 
themselves of this advice, it might be well that they keep in 
mind the annexed condition, that, " in time of their cure,

ing plaisters upon the grieved place ; according to art ap- 
pointed for that purpose in Chirurgerie."

Sand hillocks near the sea; common. â€” At Aberdeen, on the 
sand hills, both south and north of Don mouth, and on very 
many parts of the east coast. Abundant, along with Elymus 
arenarius, in the north of Sutherland. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” These four species have, by some, been placed in no fewer 
than three genera, but the differences are not so material as to de- 
mand here such a subdivision. Few comparing together A. Phrag- 
mites and Epigejos, in the advanced stage, would think of putting 
them in different genera ; and as to A. arenaria, there does not 
seem, beyond the closer panicle, to be even a good technical cha- 
racter for which it ought to be separated from the others. 

Attention to the generic marks, in connexion with the close cylin- 
drical spikes, very long stipule, and the maritime station, will leave 
little difficulty regarding A. arenaria. The number of florets in 
the calyx might be, alone, enough to distinguish the Phragmites from 
any other Arundo ; although to this species, no doubt, A. Epigejos 
bears a degree of similarity, at least in an advanced stage. The bright 
brownish-purple spike, spreading in all directions, the thick stem, the 
very long broad leaves, not to mention the watery stations, are, in A. 
Phragmites, abundantly distinct from the close and fainter spike, with 
its branches directed to one side, of A. Epigejos,* which has the stem 
feebler and leaves smaller ; and has, moreover, not been met with in 
the north in the quantity of more than a few specimens together, 
while A. Phragmites is usually very abundant wherever it grows. 
With A. Epigejos, however, the Scottish botanist will seldom re- 
quire to deal, as I am not aware that any station in the kingdom 
has been previously recorded, except " Dalrymple wood, Ayr, Scot- 
land." It is, however, not unlikely that this grass exists in other 



* Mr. W. Wilson has observed this grass " open at the exact time of flowering." 

Of this point I am no judge, having seen it only in the early and advanced stages 

first in Braemar, about the middle of July, 1833 ; and again, about a month 
later, in 1835, at Drumoak, in company with Mr. Adams and others. Owing to 
the plants in neither of these cases being in the fittest state for examination, it has 
been found necessary to quote the last branch of the description of A. Epigejos from 
Sir J. Smith. For the same reason, and, besides, on account of the obscurity and 
discrepancy among authors regarding this species and Arundo Calamagrosiis (Cala- 
magrostis lanceolata. Hooker's British Flora), the remarks on these species have 
not been made entirely without hesitation.

parts of Deeside ; and, indeed, it is strange that so conspicuous and 
elegant a plant should have so frequently escaped notice, in a tract 
so well known and so often explored. In Arundo Calamagrostis, 
Linn. (Calamagrostis lanceolata of Hooker s British Flora), a spe- 
cies said not to be uncommon in some parts of Britain, the calyx- 
scales are smoother and the tuft of hairs shorter ; while the panicle 
is more uniformly spreading and smaller than in A. Epigejos, of 
which, indeed, according to my observation, the panicle, though 
narrower, is longer than in the Phragmites, being occasionally little 
less than a foot in length. 

This genus is of little interest to the agriculturist. The 
panicles of A. Phragmites have been used, in Sweden, as a 
green dye, and its reeds are frequently employed, in the 
south of Britain, for thatch, garden fences, and other pur- 
poses. In Holland, where this species seems abundant, I 
have frequently observed it lying in sheaves ; and in some 
parts of England, it is said to be annually cut as a regular 
crop. Newborough, in Anglesea, subsists chiefly by manu- 
facturing A. arenaria into mats and ropes, and it is put 
to the same use in the outer Hebrides ; but this species 
has a far more important use. It grows upon the sea shore, 
and binds the loose sand into the form of hillocks ; thus 
serving the double purpose of preventing the adjacent country 
from being inundated by the sea or overspread with loose sand. 
More than one spot, within the tract to which these observa- 
tions relate, have been rendered worthless from being blown 
over with sand ; and the yet more dreaded encroachment of 
the sea'would have been greatly felt on flat parts of the 
English coast, and still more in Holland, had it not been for 
the embankments formed mainly by this grass with the sand 
â€” a combination which, possibly, may have been, in some 
instances, the remote origin of sand-stone cliffs. The sand 
hillocks, at Aberdeen, are chiefly formed by means of this 
species and Festuca rubra ; Carex arenaria as well as Triti- 
cura junceum being in smaller quantity. 

Mr. Sinclair observes, " So far back as the reign of Wil- 
liam III. the important value of Elymus arenarius, and 
Arundo arenaria was so well appreciated as to induce the 
Scottish Parliament of that period to pass an Act for their 
preservation on the sea coasts of Scotland. And these pro- 
visions were, by the British Parliament, in the reign of 
George II. followed up by farther enactments, extending 
the operation of the Scottish law to the coasts of England, 
and imposing further penalties for its inviolability ; so that 
it was rendered penal not only for any individual (without

even excepting the Lord of the Manor) to cut the bent, but 
for any one to be in possession of any, within eight miles of 
the coast." 

GENUS XIV. AGROSTIS. 

Calyx of two scales, not quite equal, acute, awnless, con- 
taining one floret. Corolla of two unequal scales, the

low its middle.

In Caithness and Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” To him who considers merely the written characters of the 
.preceding species of Agrostis, it may appear easy to distinguish them. 
It will seem no difficult matter to detect the 1st sp. by its longish, 
acute stipule, evident awns, and one of the pieces of the corolla mi- 
nute or wanting ; the 2d, by its very short, blunt stipule and awnless 
flowers ; and the 3d, by its long, pointed stipule, awnless flowers, and 
the very long panicle, which is usually greenish-white and contracted, 
with rough branches, and by rooting runners thrown out from the 
bottom of the stem. On the other hand, the botanist surveying 
them frequently in the field may see cause to conclude that, in Na- 
ture, the differences are by no means always evident, and even per- 
haps, to suppose that they run so much into one another, as col- 
lectively to form but one good species. A. canina, for instance, will 
be found occasionally without awns, and without deficiency in the 
scales of the corolla ; so that this latter circumstance, though some- 
times made a reason for this plant being put into a different genus, 
is not properly sufficient for even a good specific mark ; while it will 
also be found that neither the 2d nor 3d s^.-is invariably awnless. 
It is probable that neither of these opinions is altogether correct ; 
for, though the differences are by no means always well marked, the 
three species may be considered quite distinct, and will generally be 
detected by the points above noticed. 

Upon the title-page of his second Volume, Lightfoot figures an 
Agrostis, under the name of A. pumila, which is considered a variety 
of the vulgaris. This is a curious little species, almost stemless, 
with the rather conspicuous spike seated, as it were, upon the ground, 
which I have sometimes met with in Aberdeenshire, particularly in 
the parishes of Kincardine O'Neil and Tullynessle ; and it has been 
sent to me from Birse. 

It is to be added that the species named alba is not without dif- 
ficulty and interest both to the botanist and agriculturist. Many 
years ago, Dr. Richardson, an Irish gentleman, recommended, 
under the name of Fiorin, an Agrostis which has sometimes been 
called alba and sometimes stolonifera ; while Mr. Sinclair gives 
the name of A. alba to a creeping-rooted, unproductive Agrostis, 
and that of A. stolonifera to a species having a fibrous root and 
creepers running along the surface. Of this last species, consi- 
dered A. alba of Linnreus, Mr. Sinclair figures three varieties; one

with awned flowers, first pointed out by the Duke of Bedford ; an- 
other with a large, spreading, dingy purple panicle and long broad 
leaves ; and a third, distinguished by a smaller, denser, whitish 
panicle, and smaller leaves. There is reason to think that the second 
of these varieties (a rare native form) is the plant which Dr. 
Richardson had in view ; and that the third variety, which, in agri- 
culture, is said to be considerably inferior to the second, is the plant 
named alba in the present publication. 

It may be mentioned that the species of this genus differ greatly 
from themselves, as observed in different stages. . Indeed, it might 
be said of them and various other grasses, that the species, in a cer- 
tain stage, compared with itself at a different period, differs more 
in aspect than it does, perhaps, from another species in the same 
stage. 

Mr. Sinclair thinks the Agrostis recommended by Dr. 
Richardson (probably a variety of alba) worthy of attention, 
but not of so much value as has been supposed. The chief 
advantage, he says, of this grass, in permanent pasture, is its 
late growth ; and it will be found, upon inspection that, in 
those pastures, the latest herbage and sometimes the earliest, 
is principally afforded by this grass. Mr. Geo. Don seems 
to lose temper with Dr. Richardson and his favourite grass. 
Omitting the first part, the following words may be quoted : 
â€” *' Now what is this celebrated Fiorin-grass of Dr. Richard- 
son ? It seems to be a mixture of all the tribe of couchy 
grasses, held equally in detestation by the farmers and their 
cattle ; and we, in Angus-shire, are apt to judge of the in- 
dustry of the farmer, in proportion as he has eradicated these 
grasses. In the west of England, the Agrostis stolonifera is 
held in equal detestation by the farmers, and stigmatized by 
the name of black squitch. The Agrostides are the worst 
to eradicate of any grasses I am acquainted with. I am 
bold to say that, if these grasses, so strongly recommended 
by Dr. Richardson, come really to be introduced among 
farmers, it will prove the greatest barrier in the way of im- 
provement that has ever yet taken place. * * * Dr. 
Richardson adds, that Irish cattle give Florin the preference 
to all other grasses â€” our cattle, on the contrary, give every 
other grass the preference to the Agrostides. â€” (Headrlck's 
Survey of Angus, Appendix, p. 29. et seq.) To this we may 
oppose the words of Withering, who refers to " an Essay by 
the Rev. Dr. Richardson of Clonfecle, in which many ex- 
periments are detailed, tending to prove that Florin-grass 
produces hay preferred by cattle to all other, and near treble 
the quantity afforded by any other grass ; that this enormous 
produce is not the exhausting effect of a single year, but the

regular crop to be expected ; that this succulent grass is 
equally serviceable for winter green food ; that it is, in a 
great degree, indifferent to the extremes of wet and drought, 
and perfectly insensible to the severities of cold ; and that its 
universality of growth is most remarkable. * * It ap- 
pears particularly suitable to unproductive extensive tracts." 

GENUS XV. AIRA. 

Calyx of two scales, containing two perfect florets, 
without any rudiments of a third. Corolla of two 
scales ; the outer one largest, and either awnless or 
with an awn attached to its back, above the base. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Aira cristata. Crested Hair-grass. 
Poa cristata. LightfooVs Flora Scotica. 
Airochloa cristata, Lindley's Synopsis. 

Root of downy fibres. Stem five to six inches high and up- 
wards, downy especially above. Leaves hairy at the edges, 
mostly confined to the lower part of the stem, where they are 
rather narrow, almost bristle-like ; farther up, one or two 
shorter and broader, ending in long downy sheaths, which are 
ribbed like the upper surface of the leaves. Stipule short. 
Panicle in the form of a spike, interrupted particularly be- 
low, shining ; its common stalk very downy. Calyx and 
corolla pointed ; the latter the longer, its inner scale white 
and membranous. 

In the neighbourhood of the sea, and in inland situations ; 
not uncommon. â€” Near Aberdeen, in several places, as on the 
Links, Broadhill, banks of Dee, &c. On dry elevated moors 
in Alford. Abundant on the Kincardine coast, and in various 
parts of Buchan and Banffshire.

Stems not erect, usually floating, occasionally extending 
to a very great length. Leaves broad and blunt, of a plea- 
sant green, with loose sheaths, and pointed, broad stipules. 
Panicle reddish-brown, much spread out ; the branches as- 
suming a whorled appearance. Scales of the calyx unequal, 
short, purplish, not nearly so long as the included florets.

In ditches, pools, and the edges of slow streams ; not fre- 
quent. â€” Said to occur occasionally around Aberdeen. Rather 
common in Alford. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June. 

Obs.â€” The want of awns may serve to separate these two species 
from the succeeding members of the genus ; and they may be dis- 
tinguished from one another, by recollecting the downy, spike-like 
panicle of Aira cristata, with its very dry stations ; and the spread- 
ing reddish panicle, and short calyx of A. aquatica, with the broad, 
blunt, and usually floating leaves. 

3. Aira ccespitosa. Turfy Hair-grass. 

Deschampsia ccespitosa. Lindleys Synopsis. 

Stems two or three feet high, nearly erect, with a long 
leafless portion next the panicle. Leaves long, flat, pointed, 
rigid, furrowed and rough above, much smoother beneath ; 
those from the root numerous. Panicle elegant, very large 
and spreading, shining, brownish-grey ; the branches wiry 
and slightly rough. Calyx- scales nearly as long as the in- 
cluded florets, which have, at their base, short, whitish 
hairs springing from the bottom of the outer scale of the 
corolla, with an awn scarcely extending beyond themselves, 
and therefore little perceptible. One of the florets is sessile ; 
the other on a short hairy stalk. 

Roadsides and borders of fields ; rather common. 
Clova and Caithness. Mr. H. C. Watson. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

4. Aira alpina. Smooth Alpine Hair-grass. 
Aira Icevigata. English Botany. 

Stem ten or twelve inches high. Leaves mostly from the 
root, flat, furrowed above, very often rolled up so as to ap- 
pear awl-shaped, short, especially those of the stem, which 
have very long smooth sheaths. Panicle shining, greyish- 
brown, sometimes erect and close ; but, when viviparous 
(as it usually is), with spreading or even drooping branches. 
Scales of the calyx as long as the corolla. Awn short, at- 
tached to the outer scale of the corolla, above its middle. 
One of the florets on a short smooth stalk. 

Moist alpine situations. â€” Ben more, in Sutherland, where it is 
viviparous. 

Upon rocks, on the south side of Glen Dole, to the east of 
those on which the Astragalus alpinus grows. Dr. Balfour. â€” 
Near the summit of Ben-na-muic-dhui. Mr. Watson ; who ob-

served it 1350 yards high in Braemar, and about 1000, in 
Sutherland. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

5. Aira flexuosa. Wavy Mountain Hair-grass. 

Stem nearly naked, slender, in general more than a foot 
high. Leaves short and bristle-shaped, mostly from the 
root. Panicle of a purple or brown hue, much spread out 
in the flowering stage, dividing more or less in a threefold 
manner ; the branches fine and twisted. Scales of the calyx 
about as long as the included florets, which are hairy at the 
base, each with a long and very evident awn. 

Heaths, hilly places, and upland woods ; not uncommon. 

Mr. Watson found it on the mountains of Clova, Braemar, 
and Sutherland; respectively at the heights of 950, 1200, and 
1000 yards. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

6. Aira caryophyttea. Silver Hair-grass. 

Stems smooth, of variable height, from three or four 
inches to a full foot. Leaves few, narrow, almost bristle- 
shaped, with purplish, ribbed sheaths. Panicle of few flowers, 
purplish or greyish ; the branches diverging and a little wavy. 
Calyx Avhite and transparent at the point, rather longer than 
the enclosed florets, which are both sessile, and have a few 
hairs at the base, with a long evident awn. 

Sterile fields ; not uncommon. 

Near Aberdeen, in many places. Rubislaw Quarry. Mr. 
W. M. White. â€” Caithness and Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 
Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

7. Aira pracox. Early Hair-grass. 

Stems two or three inches high. Leaves short and bris- 
tle-shaped, with swollen angular sheaths. Panicle erect, 
close, assuming the form of a spike. Calyx and corolla 
of similar length ; the awn twice as long and sufficiently 
evident. Florets both sessile. 

Sandy places and dry pastures ; rather common. â€” Old Aber- 
deen Links, Craiglug, &c. 

Caithness and Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 

Annual. â€” flowering in the end of May and June. 

Obs. â€” The two species in the first section have little affinity to 
those in the present, or, indeed, to one another. The members of 
the present group are more allied among themselves, and they have 



TIUANDRTA.] HOLCUS. 55 

been considered (or some of them) to have an analogy to the genus 
Arundo, which they resemble in having hairs around the base of the 
corolla, far less conspicuous, however, than the extensive tuft which 
communicates a character to the genus just named. 

Aira ccespitosa is the well known, large, and coarse grass, often 
observed at roadsides, untouched by cattle ; seldom growing single, 
but in tufts ; sufficiently characterized by the long, fiat, rough leaves, 
which are chiefly from the root, and a long panicle, the awns of 
which are scarcely visible. A. flexuosa is known by the bristle- 
shaped leaves, zig-zag branches of the panicle, and the long-awned 
corolla. It may be mentioned that, in the North-west of Sutherland, 
I have observed a tall, slender, pale-flowered variety of this species, 
which is probably A. flexuosa /3. of Smith, the grass sometimes called 
Aira montana. From both A. ccespitosa and flexuosa, the far rarer A. 
alpina may at all times be distinguished by its short, flat leaves, 
often rolled inwards, and indistinct awns ; to which may be added 
the viviparous condition wherein it usually exists. Distinct as are 
the sp. 5 and 6, it is possible for them to be confounded ; and I 
know not that any marks can be set forth in words, more avail- 
able than the white-pointed calyx of A. caryophyllea, with its small 
spikelets, as compared with the far larger ones of flexuosa. In 
the last place, A.pracox is sufficiently marked by its very small size, 
spike-like panicle, and the inflated angular sheaths. 

About the properties of this genus little can be said. Aira 
c&spitosa, being one of the roughest and coarsest grasses, 
is seldom or never touched by our common animals ; and 
they show, according to my observation, nearly an equal re- 
luctance to feed upon A. cristata. A. caryophyllea and pre- 
cox furnish little herbage, and soon wither away. 

GENUS XVII. HOLCUS. 

Calyx of two scales, containing two florets ; the lower 
one perfect and awnless, the upper with stamens only 
and awned. Seed coated with the hardened corolla. 

SPECIES. 

1. Holcus lanatus. Meadoiv Soft-grass. 

Root fibrous. Stem downy, as well as both sides of the 
leaves, which are mostly at the lower part of the plant ; the 
upper ones ending in downy, almost woolly sheaths. Stipules 
short and blunt. Panicle of a reddish-green hue ; its branches 
downy or hairy. Calyx of two very downy scales, which are 
blunt and terminated by a thorn. The enclosed flowers are 
two in number ; the lower perfect and awnless, the upper 
barren, with a curved, barely perceptible awn. 



56 HOLCUS. [tuiandkia. 

Pastures and roadsides ; very common. Sometimes ascend- 
ing to a great height. 

Kirktown, Clova ; Castleton, Braemar ; Sutherland and 
north of Caithness. Mr. Watson. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

2. Holcus mollis. Creeping Soft-grass. 

Root creeping, sometimes to a considerable extent. Stem 
leafy to the top, somewhat hairy, especially at the knots. 
Leaves similar to those of the preceding species, but with- 
out the soft down. Panicle whitish-green. .Calyx-scales 
acute, mostly bare, containing two flowers, the upper barren, 
with a sharply-bent, long, and very evident awn. 

In cultivated fields and woods ; rather frequent. â€” Near Aber- 
deen, not uncommon ; and so frequent in Alford, particularly on 
the Breda property, as to be reckoned a troublesome weed. 
Common in the Garioch ; Buchan ; Banffshire ; and throughout 
the north. 

Oldtown Links at Aberdeen, Bay of Nigg, and Den of Rubis- 
law. Mr. Dickie. â€” As common around Aberdeen as H. lanahis. 
Mr. W. M. White. â€” Aberdour. Rev. Geo. Gardiner. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” The prominent awn of the 2d species is quite enough for 
a distinction between it and the 1st, of which the awn is so con- 
cealed as seldom or never to be perceptible. As the distinction is 
of importance to the agriculturist, we may farther compare the 
creeping root, greenish and rather small panicle, and (best of all) 
the calyx tapering to a point in H. mollis ; with the fibrous, not 
creeping, root, purplish larger panicle, and the rather blunt calyx- 
scales of H. lanatus, which are tipped with a small but very distinct 
thorn. 

With respect to the well-known tall grass usually styled H. 
avenaceus, 1 am disposed to refer it to the genus Avena, and to 
resume the name of Linnaeus. 

The late Duke of Bedford made trial of II. lanatus upon a 
large scale, and the results proved that it is a very inferior 
species for either pasture or hay. This is mentioned by Mr. 
Sinclair, who adds, that it is disliked by cattle, is not an 
early grass, and when once in possession of the soil, can 
scarcely be extirpated. It has, however, the merit of grow- 
ing readily and luxuriantly upon all soils, particularly those 
of a peaty nature ; and it produces seed in abundance. 

Holcus mollis is a troublesome and injurious weed. Its 
large creeping roots (said sometimes to grow to the length 



triandiua.] HIEROCHLOE. MELICA. 57 

of five feet in a few mouths only) draw away no small quan- 
tity of nourishment, and when once introduced, they are got 
rid of with great difficulty ; while Mr. Sinclair thinks cattle 
dislike its herbage, more than that of H. lanatus. This 
author mentions that pigs eagerly dig up the roots, which 
contain a very considerable quantity of nutritious matter, 
having the flavour of new-made meal ; and he hints at the 
advantage of cultivating the grass upon naked sands for the 
sake of the roots. 

GENUS XVIII. HIEROCHLOE. 

Panicle loose. Calyx of two ovate, acute, membranous, 
awnless scales, containing three florets ; the central 
of which is perfect, its stamens two ; the lateral ones 
barren, having three stamens and no pistil. Corolla of 
two unequal, permanently membranous scales. Seed 
loose. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Hierochloe borealis. Northern Holy-grass. 
Holcus odoratus. Linn. 

Root creeping extensively. Stems twelve to eighteen 
inches high, erect, leafy. Leaves rather broad, fiat, rough 
at the edges. Panicle brownish, glossy, a little directed to 
one side. Flower-stalks smooth. Flowers broadly ovate, 
tumid, greenish-yellow, variegated with purple or brown, 
" Nectary in two deep, unequal, linear segments." 

Said to have been found in a narrow mountain-valley, called 
Kella, in Angus-shire, by the late Mr. George Don.* 
Perennial â€” flowering in May and June. 

Obs. â€” The words regarding the nectary are from Smith ; and, 
indeed, the writer of these remarks having no perfect specimens of 
Hierochloe borealis, has mostly trusted to others for the preceding 
account. 1 he name of the genus is from 'iepos, sacred, and x^ oa , grass. 

GENUS XIX. MELICA. 

Calyx of two awnless, nearly equal scales, about as long 
as the florets. Corolla of two unequal, awnless scales, 
at last hardened, and covering the loose seed. Spike- 
let of one or two perfect florets, with another imper- 
fect and stalked. 

* No other British station has ever been given for this plant; but in some parts 
of the Continent it is common enough. It grows in moist meadows in Germany, 
and it is said to be used, at high festivals, for strewing the chinches in Prussia. 
Dr. Hooker mentions that, in Iceland, it is used by the people for scenting apart- 
ments and clothes.

SPECIES. 

1. Melica nutans. Mountain Melic-grass. 

MeliccB nutantis varietas. Lightfoofs Flora Scotica. 
Root creeping. Stem more than a foot high, the upper 
part naked, with long leaves and a very short stipule. Pan- 
icle close, drooping, its spikelets upon mostly undivided 
stalks, becoming pendulous and directed towards one side. 
Scales of the calyx convex and purple without, each having 
in its inside a perfect floret, with its corolla finally cartilagin- 
ous ; and between these two florets, a single, long-stalked, 
imperfect one. 

In upland stations, but rather rare ; as on the hill adjacent to 
Ballater House.

not design it as rare. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June. 

2. Melica uniflora. Wood Melic-grass. 
Melica nutans. Lightfoofs Flora Scotica. 

Similar to the preceding, but with an essential difference 
in each spikelet containing but a single perfect flower, to 
which an imperfect one is attached by a bent stalk. 
Rare. 

Near Forfar. Mr. G. Don. About the Dream, Kilmorack. 
Mr. Stables. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June. 

Obs. â€” These singular and elegant grasses are in a general wav 
indicated by the variegated spikelets, with the broad, convex, au- 
burn calyx, and the panicle ultimately more or less unilateral and 
drooping. M. uniflora has the panicle more branched and the 
spikelets more erect than M. nutans, with broader, rougher leaves, 
and a taller stem. But the best distinction resides in the spikelets, 
which in No. 2. contain but a single perfect flower, together with 
the stalked imperfect one ; and not two perfect flowers as in No. 1 ; 
a difference which is very obvious upon an inspection made with the 
least attention. The author of these observations has examined not 
a few specimens of Melica gathered by himself, and presented by 
others, which have invariably possessed two complete flowers in every 
spikelet ; and, Mr. Don's station being scarcely within the range 
of this publication, he has introduced M. uniflora from a reliance 
upon Mr. Stables, particularly as another accurate observer (Rev. 
G. Gordon) also appears, from Mr. Watson's " Outlines," to have 
found this species in Moray.

plant. Panicle dull violet, erect, branched, not spreading. 
Calyx shorter than the florets, of which the two lowest are 
perfect and the upper imperfect. Anthers deep purple. 

Moors ; but in many places not abundant. â€” Near Aberdeen, at

Mr. H. C. Watson observed this species in Clova, Braemar, 
and Sutherland â€” at an elevation of about 800 yards in the 
Aberdeenshire stations. 

Perennial â€” flowering in August. 

Obs. â€” A. considerable time ago it occurred to the writer of these 
remarks, when but a young botanist, unacquainted with the history 
of this species, that it was an unfit associate for M. nutans, having, 
in appearance, more of a similarity to the members of some other 
genera ; while, even with considerable attention to technical charac- 
ters, the botanist may fail in tracing any essential relation between 
these species. The opinion of Dr. Lindley and others, who place 
them in different genera, is, therefore, readily here followed. The 
purplish close panicle, the wiry stem which is bulbous at the base, 
with a knot a short way up, are, perhaps, sufficient indications of 
Molinia ccerulea. 



t>0 POA. [tkiandkia. 

With M. depauperata of Lindley there is some difficulty in deal- 
ing, as it is not easy to believe that a plant to which this author 
alludes as a remarkable addition to the Botany of Britain, commu- 
nicated in his Synopsis as found upon the Clova mountains, can 
be the not uncommon plant {^variety, as it is usually considered of 
M. cceridea) with which I am well enough acquainted, as grow- 
ing among the rank grass of Sutherland, and even in some of the 
Aberdeenshire woods. The plant in view has also been communi- 
cated by various friends, as Dr. Balfour of Edinburgh and Mr. 
Proctor; the latter sending it from "the petrifying spring at 
Inchrory, on the head of Don," and the former observing " Melica 
ccerulea /3. or Molinia depauperata, on rocks to the west of Glen 
Fee, not far from the station for Oxytropis campestris ; also on rocks 
on the north side of Canlochan Glen, at the head of Glen Isla." 
This variety or species is characterized by long leaves, a slender, 
long, and pale panicle, and by the spikelet containing but a single 
long perfect flower. It deserves to be added that Dr. Lindley's view 
as to Molinia depauperata being specifically distinct from M. cceru- 
lea, probably deserves more attention than it seems to have received. 

The stems of M. c&rulea have been used for brooms, bas- 
kets, &c. ; and it is mentioned by Lightfoot that, in Skye, 
the fishermen make ropes for nets from this grass. It has 
also been said that the milk of cows which feed upon it, 
is very rich and highly coloured. 

GENUS XXI. POA. 

Calyx of two short, unequal, awnless scales, usually con-

Obs. â€” The long and narrow spikelets of these three species suf- 
ficiently separate them from the succeeding members of the same 
genus. The 1st sp. very rare with us, though common enough in the 
south of Britain, and in the fens of England particularly abundant, 
may be distinguished from most other grasses, and with certainty 
from every other Poa, by its great size. It would be superflu- 
ous to detail distinctions between this tall, stout, erect grass, and 
the feeble, floating or ci-eeping P. fluitans. Lightfoot conjectured 
that the 3d sp. might prove a variety of the 2d â€” the difference prob-

ably arising from the former growing in sea-water â€” but that they

ner. Leaves numerous, chiefly found below, soft, and often 
crumpled here and there. Upper stipules longish, acute ; 
those below, short, blunt, and jagged. Panicle with diverg- 
ing branches 5 the spikelets containing about five webless 
and rather remote, five-ribbed florets.

Mr. H. C. Watson observed this species in Caithness and 
Sutherland ; and at considerable elevations throughout the north. 
Annual â€” flowering in spring and all summer. 

8. Poa nemoralis. Wood Meadow-grass. 

Plant slender and delicate. Leaves long and pointed, 
mostly upon the stem. Stipule very short and notched. 
Panicle spreading, with fine, but rough branches. Spikelets 
small, each composed of two or three greenish-white, ob- 
scurely ribbed flowers, which are webless, but hairy at the 
base. Calyx-scales narrow, pointed.

Aberdeenshire woods. Anonymous. â€” In the province of Moray. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” The comparatively short and broad spikelets of this section 
sufficiently distinguish it from the preceding, and the existence, in 
several of its species, of a web, connecting the flowers, is another 
notable distinction. The difference, indeed, is so great that Sir. 
James Smith has placed the first group, consisting of species with 
long narrow spikelets and webless flowers, in a new genus (Glvce- 
ria) ; yet there is so much of an affinity between some species of 
Poa and Glyceria of this author, that the separation is of doubtful 
propriety. 

Without repeating other characters, it may be observed that P. 
alpina will usually be distinguished from any other Poa, by its vivi- 
parous condition. Between the sp. 5 and 6 no little similarity ex- 
ists ; but, in an agricultural point of view, it is of importance to make 
the distinction, which, indeed, may, with moderate care, be readily 
effected. P. pratensis is a smooth grass, whereas the roughness of P. 
scabra,* particularly in the upper part of the stem, becomes evident 



* This name used, I bi'lieve, upon the Continent for the species usually called 
P. trivialis, has been here adopted.

enough, upon drawing the plant through the fingers. But the best 
distinction resides in the stipule, which, in the former, is very short 
and blunt ; while, in the latter, it is longer and pointed. As to P. 
memoralis, perhaps, there is no readier mark of it than the very 
small size of the spikelets, each composed of two or three flowers. 
P. annua is well characterized by the compressed and nearly pros- 
trate stem, crumpled leaves, and the ultimately diverging or even 
turned down branches of the panicle. Farther, each flower is 
quite separate from the others â€” a mark, it is to be observed, which 
can be well applied only in the most expanded state, in which, 
however, it is very manifest. In contrast with this circumstance, 
it may be observed that, in P. pratensis, the web connecting the 
flowers is so copious as usually to be evident, even without any 
pains to effect a separation, for the purpose of bringing it into view. 
In P. scabra it is less distinct, but still perceptible enough ; while, 
in the nemoralis, its existence can scarcely be demonstrated. 

It is to be observed that the Poas called glauca and ccesia, are 
considered, by Hooker, to be alpine varieties of P. nemoralis. Dr. 
Balfour observes " Poa nemoralis, vur. /3. glauca ; abundant in many 
mountains. in Clova and Braemar." 

It is not unlikely that other species of Poa, particularly P. distans, 
rigida, and procumbens, may occur in the north ; and should any sa- 
tisfactory accounts of them be afterward procured, they will be in- 
serted in an Appendix, which it is intended to devote to additional 
species and stations. 

Sir James Smith says, Poa aquatica makes a great part of 
the hay in marshy places (in England) ; and Lightfoot ob- 
sei'ves, that cattle are very fond of this grass 3 and, in deep 
muddy places, sometimes run the risk of suffocation to get at 
it. Mr. Sinclair's opinion is not very favourable to P. pra- 
tensis. It is of early growth, but the produce is compara- 
tively inconsiderable, and after Midsummer it comes up but 
slowly, after being cropped. Its creeping roots impoverish 
the soil, and Mr. Sinclair shows that Anthoxanthum odora- 
tum and P. Irivialis, equally early grasses, and not liable to 
the same objection as they have fibrous roots, are superior 
in point of productiveness. Mr. Lawson, the Highland 
Society's seedsman, considers the last-named species " a 
superior pasture grass." Mr. Curtis also observes that P. 
trivialis " is a principal grass in that uncommonly produc- 
tive meadow, near Salisbury, mentioned by Stillingfieet, and 
more particularly described in the Memoirs of the Bath 
Agricultural Society" ; and this excellent authority says of 
P. pratensis, "that its creeping root is almost as difficult to 
extirpate as that of Triticum repens, and that it ought, there- 
fore, to be cautiously introduced, where the pasturage is not 
intended to be permanent." Upon this subject it has been

observed, that a root even slightly creeping may seem to 
forbid any recommendation of the species for the alternate 
husbandry. For permanent pasture, however, the root 
creeping to a slight extent is of advantage, by securing the 
extension and continuance of the plant, without the seri- 
ous objection of impoverishing the soil, by the unprofitable 
production, under ground, of vegetable matter. 

GENUS XXII. TRIODIA. 

Calyx of two nearly equal, awnless, concave, acute

Stem much inclined, indeed lying upon the ground, ex-

the lower part of the stem, hairy like their sheaths, with a 
tuft of hairs for a stipule. Spikelets forming a panicle or 
loose spike, turgid, of a violet tinge, containing four florets. 
The corolla has two or more dense tufts of shining bris- 
tles at its base ; its teeth three in number, the middle one 
shortest. 

Boggy or moist ground ; rather common. â€” Near Aberdeen,

all our other species, and has heen therefore put in the present genus, 
the name of which is derived from rpeis, three, and 'o8ovs, a tooth. 

Mr. Sinclair says this grass is little susceptible of im-

it never appeared to be cropped by the deer in Woburn Park.

He adds, that it is late in the production of foliage in the

to he recommended for cultivation. Mr. G. C. Smith, how- 
ever, ingeniously remarks regarding it â€” " I am of opinion 
that this, by cultivation, would be improved, and become of 
consequence as a grain crop, particularly in the Highlands, 
where it is common."

ous, diverging ; its spikelets compressed, roundish-ovate, 
containing about seven flowers, which are longer than the 
calyx. 

Dry upland pasture? ; not uncommon. â€” Rare at Aberdeen.

Perennial â€” flowering in June. 

Obs. â€” This singular and elegant species has an aspect quite un- 
like that of the ordinary grasses, and is remarkable for the tremu- 
lous panicle, and the broad, ovate, greenish spikelets, which, like 
the whole upper part of the plant, become of a violet hue, in an ad- 
vanced stage. 

The result of Mr. Sinclair's experiments shows this grass 
to be best fitted for poor soils, and affords one instance that 
manure is even hurtful to some grasses. Its nutritive powers 
are considerable when compared to other grasses affecting a 
similar soil. It is eaten by horses, cows, and sheep. These

merits, therefore (adds lie), demand attention, and though 
it is unfit comparatively for rich permanent pasture, yet, 
for sandy, and also for poor tenacious soils, the Common 
Quaking-grass will be found of value. 

GENUS XXIV. DACTYLIS. 

Calyx of two unequal, pointed scales, containing several 
florets. Corolla of two unequal scales, the outer awned, 
and membranous at the edges, the inner narrower. 
Seed, with a longitudinal furrow, loosely covered by 
the unaltered corolla. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Dactylis glomerata. Rough Cock' ' s-foot- grass . 

Stem about two feet high. Leaves harsh, rough-edged, 
with angular scabrous sheaths. Branches of the panicle stiff 
and rough, each bearing a dense globular tuft of bristly 
crowded spikelets, turned to one side. Calyx-scales very 
unequal. Outer scale of the corolla five-ribbed, with a short 
awn. Anthers purplish, pendulous. 

Waysides and shaded places ; but not always common. â€” At 
Aberdeen, on the banks of the Canal, and at the sides of the 
road between the Broadhill and Canal, &c. Occasionally in the 
Alford churchyards, but not frequent in that district. 

Perennial â€” flowering all the summer. 

Obs. â€” The characters of this genus are akin to those of Festuca, 
though the general aspect is very different. The present species is 
a harsh coarse grass, distinguished by the round somewhat bristly 
tufts of the panicle, which has stiff rough branches, and a tortuous 
central stalk. 

Mr. Sinclair is of opinion that this grass is more valuable 
for pasture than for hay, and that even for this latter pur- 
pose it will be found more valuable than Rye-grass ; for a 
knowledge of which superiority the agricultural world is in- 
debted to Mr. Coke of Norfolk. Mr. Sinclair found this 
grass, in every instance, to constitute a portion of the herb- 
age in the most celebrated pastures in Devonshire, Lincoln- 
shire, and the Vale of Aylesbury.

1 . Cynosurus cristatus. Crested Dog's-tail-grass. 
Stem one foot high and upwards. Leaves short and flat, 
but sometimes rolled up ; their sheaths long. Spike from 
one and a half, to two inches long, with a rough, wavy, middle 
stalk. Spikelets composed of two or more flowers, and 
accompanied by pinnate bracteas. Calyx of two equal, 
awned scales ; those of the corolla unequal, the outer- 
most having a short awn. 

Dry pastures and parks ; common. â€” Near Aberdeen, on the 
Links, Stocket, and Kincardine coast. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” This grass is remarkable for remaining upon lawns, with 
a withered and desolate aspect, through the autumn, or even most 
of the winter ; and likewise for the pinnate or comb-like bracteas, 
which appear to be, in reality, imperfect spikelets, composed of 
nothing but calyx-scales, arranged in two rows. These are awned 
in C. echinatus, a species unknown in this quarter. 

Mr. Sinclair considers this an inferior grass for hay, but 
admirably adapted for permanent pasture ; and it constituted 
a very considerable portion of all the most celebrated pas- 
tures examined by this accurate observer. 

GENUS XXVI. FESTUCA. 

Calyx of two unequal, lanceolate scales, containing a 
spikelet of many florets, placed in two ranks. Corolla of 
two unequal scales, the outer terminating in an awn, more 
rarely in a point ; the inner, two-ribbed, folded in, and 
mostly downy at each rib. Seed oblong, loose, though 
closely enveloped in the corolla. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Festuca ovina. Sheep's Fescue-grass. 

Stems from four to eight inches high, square, numerous, 
almost thread-like, naked above. Leaves numerous, rolled 
into a bristle-form, and composing dense radical tufts ; their 
stipules very short. Panicle rather close and small, tending 
to one side. Calyx containing four or five florets, sometimes 
only pointed, but more frequently with a very short awn. 

Sea coast ; dry elevated woods and other places ; rather com- 
mon. â€” At Aberdeen, on the moors in Newhills, Stocket, &c. ; 
and on the bent-hills both south and north of Don. Frequent 
in the woods of Alford, where are several varieties, differing 
mainly in the degree in which the flowers are awned or pointed, 
and in the colour and size of the plants. Buchan. Banffshire

3. Festuca duriuscula. Hard Fescue-grass. 

Root fibrous. Stem round, larger than in F. ovina. Up- 
per leaves usually flat, those of the root folded and bristle- 
like. Panicle directed to one side, large, and in the flower- 
ing stage much spread out; its branches roughish. Spike- 
lets of about six flowers, the uppermost often imperfect. 
Corolla with a distinct awn, much shorter than itself. 

Woods and dry places ; common. â€” Aberdeen on the Banks of

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

4. Festuca rubra. Creeping Fescue-grass. 

Festuca duriuscula /3. â€” Hooker's Flora Scotica. 

Root creeping, said sometimes to extend to many feet 
or even yards. Leaves downy above, more or less rolled up 
especially the lowest. Panicle spreading, unilateral ; the 
spikelets containing about six shortly-awned flowers, covered 
with fine whitish down. 

On every part of the sandy coast, forming the best part of the 
vegetation of the bent hillocks. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” The small size, very short awns, and the bristle-like leaves 
sufficiently point out F. ovina. Upon the Kincardineshire coast, 
this species occurs with glaucous leaves â€” the F. eeesia of some 



70 FESTUCA. frniANDiiiA- 

authors â€” and, in Braemar, I have gathered a variety with the spike- 
lets densely downy, perhaps the form to which Hooker alludes as 
Festuca hirsuta. Host. Both these modifications might have a claim 
to rank as species in a genus the members of which often tread 
closely upon one another. Sp. 2 is abundantly evident from the 
germinating tendency, which is the origin of the specific name, 
and, though usually considered a variety of the 1st, it seems rather 
to be a distinct species. F. duriuscula is best distinguished from 
ovina by its much greater size and more distinct awns, although 
its usually flat upper leaves may also be taken into account. It 
makes, however, a nearer approach to the rubra, from which, indeed, 
it has been sometimes viewed as not specifically different; for the 
creeping root of the last-mentioned plant is scarcely to be considered 
a real difference. At least, I have some reason for thinking that 
other species assume the same condition when growing among loose 
sand, which readily permits the roots to extend themselves widely. 
Considering the downy flowers of this species, it might be said to 
bear the same relation to the duriuscula as the downy form of F. 
ovina, already referred to, does to the more ordinary state of that 
species. It deserves to be added that Mr. Dickie has observed a 
hairy variety of F. ovina, upon the sea-coast ; while I have seen 
some specimens, from Lochlee, of a glaucous, somewhat downy, 
pale green, F. duriuscula (rubra ? Cambrica ? ?) ; so that we seem 
entitled to conclude that there is a hairy F. ovina, found both in 
alpine and maritime habitats, as there also seems to be a hairy 
alpine and maritime variety of F. duriuscula. It is, however, expe- 
dient to retain F. rubra as the name of a plant precisely enough 
defined by its extensive root, downiness, and pale colour, as well as 
by its usually growing in sand.

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” Festuca calamaria is a tall species, with a very branching 
panicle and flat leaves ; and, judging by the few specimens in my 
possession, it might be called an elegant grass, with the panicle 
comparatively of small size; the spikelets small, awnless, and mak- 
ing some approach to those of F. ovina. The 6th species will be 
detected by bearing in mind its great size, flat leaves, and ovate 
spikelets, which are shortly awned. From this species, the succeed- 
ing one (pratensis) differs, in being smaller, with less pointed spike- 
lets. It ought, however, to be recollected that every variety in the 
size of F. elatior and the length of its awn is to be met with in this 
quarter ; and I venture to suggest that a grass agreeing with the 
characters of F. pratensis, and at the same time truly different from 
the elatior is seldom or never wild in the North-east of Scotland. 
A French author observes that Smith's F. pratensis is not Lamarck's 
plant of the same name ; and he agrees with some of our own bo- 
tanists that it is but a variety of F. elatior. Notwithstanding all 
this, it may be concluded that the former of these, which is common 
in the south of Britain, is a true species, and it has been observed 
to differ from the latter (elatior) in being but half its height, with 
leaves only half as broad ; the panicle more erect, less branched, 
with the spikelets more compressed and blunt.

ing about six florets, each terminated by an awn, twice its

Stem from one to two feet high. Leaves green, at last 
yellowish, lasting long, hairy, especially near the sheaths 
which are likewise clothed with spreading hairs. Spike 
two-ranked, slightly drooping at the top, composed of six or 
eight stalkless, hairy spikelets, which are about an inch 
long, and incline more or less to one side, with awns longer 
than the flowers. Outer scale of the corolla terminated by 
the awn ; the inner fringed at the base, abrupt, and blunt. 

Not very uncommon. Usually near the coast, or in high in- 
land stations. â€” In the vicinity of Aberdeen, on the north side of 
Don, a little above the Old Bridge, and at the Cove; also, in 
Drumoak, on the north bank of Dee. Pretty common on the Kin- 
cardineshire coast, between DunnottarandMuchals. On a wooded 
hill adjacent to Ballater.

flowers in length. From these, the two last-described species dif- 
fer, in having long, conspicuous awns ; and they may be said to 
agree between themselves in no other feature. F. bromoides is known

at once by the very long awn, attached, as is usual in this genus, to 
the very point of the corolla. It cannot be distinguished, by these 
marks, from a neighbouring species, a native of the south, which 
mav be possibly found with us â€” though I have never yet here met 
with the unequivocal Myurus of England â€” known by the very long 
panicle or spike, and the stem being leafy to the top ; whereas F. 
bromoides is without leaves on its upper part, at least when the plant 
has shot up to its full height. F. sylvatica has no great similarity 
to any of our other grasses, and has at different times been reckoned 
a member of each of the following genera : â€” Festuca, Bromus, Tri- 
ticum, and Brachypodium. The awns terminating the corolla, and, 
as Smith observes, the loose seed, correspond with the genus Fes- 
tuca, while the species (which has the aspect of aTriticum) is readily 
detected by the stalkless, two-ranked spikelets, with long awns, the 
inner scale of the corolla being blunt, abrupt, and fringed. 

Mr. Sinclair is of opinion that Festuca ovina does not pos- 
sess the nutritive powers generally ascribed to it, though it 
may make a tolerable pasture for sheep. It is affirmed, on 
the authority of Linnaeus, that sheep have no relish for hills 
and heaths that are destitute of this grass, and the Tartars 
are said to fix their summer abodes where it is in greatest 
plenty, because it affords excellent food for their animals. 
This species is, doubtless, entirely unfit for hay, though Dr. 
Anderson, at one time well known in Aberdeenshire, de- 
clared that it is capable of affording an uncommon quantity 
of it ; an opinion which was combated by Mr. Curtis, 
a still better judge of these points. F. duriuscula does not 
appear to be either a very productive or remarkably nutri- 
tive grass ; but it is well adapted for the food of sheep, and 
Mr. Sinclair thinks it entitled to a place in the composition 
of the best pastures, though in a small proportion. Hares 
are fond of this grass, and have been known to crop it close, 
neglecting the contiguous F. ovina. F. pratensis is a valu- 
able grass, but as it is scarcely one of our natives, its merits 
need not be discussed ; and it is only to be added that the 
cultivation of F. elatior, upon a deep, moist soil, appears to 
be an experiment deserving of trial. No doubt the herbage 
is coarse, but this is an objection which would lie against all 
very productive grasses. 

GENUS XXVII. BROMUS. 

Calyx of two unequal, awnless scales, containing a many- 
flowered, usually compressed spikelet. Corolla of two un- 
equal scales, the outer concave, longer than the calyx, with 
an awn inserted rather below the notched summit ; the inner 
narrower, united to the seed, two-ribbed, folded, and bristly 
at the ribs.

SPECIES. 

1 . Bromus giganteus. Tall Brome-grass. 

Festuca gigantea. Smith's Flora Britannica and English 
Flora. â€” English Botany. â€” Hookers Flora Scotica. 
Stem several feet high, round and strong, with blackish 
knots. Leaves dark-green, ribbed, taper-pointed, sometimes 
a full half inch broad ; their stipules short, brown or pur- 
plish, with an acute auricle at each side clasping the stem. 
Panicle large, drooping, very much divided, its branches 
rough and somewhat twisted. Spikelets consisting of from 
three to six flowers, and far shorter than the often wavy 
awn, which is attached to the outer scale of the corolla, a 
little below the summit ; inner scale not fringed, but downy 
at the edges under a magnifier. 

Rather rare. â€” Aberdeenshire. Banks of Don, at Haughton.

2. Bromus asper. Hairy Wood Brome-grass. 

Stem erect, four or even five feet high, smooth in the up- 
per part, hairy below. Leaves uniform, very long and broad, 
harsh, hairy towards the base, particularly the lower ones, 
with long, rough, more or less hairy sheaths. Panicle of great 
length, very much spread out and drooping, with many rough 
subdivided branches. Spikelets drooping, compressed, about 
an inch long, of eight or nine rather remote downy flowers. 
Outer scale of the corolla having a rough awn, shorter than 
itself, inserted near the summit ; inner scale with a fringe, 
which is very short, but usually distinct under a magnifier.

3. Bromus sterilis. Barren Brome-grass. 

Stem from one to two feet high, slender, scarcely erect, 
clothed with downy or hairy leaves. Panicle large, droop- 
ing, composed of narrow spikelets, about an inch long, con- 
taining six or seven rather distant, strongly ribbed flowers, 
shorter than the straight awn, which is purplish and attached 
to the outer scale of the corolla, a little below the point ; 



T1UAND1UA.] BROMUS. 7^ 

inner scale fringed, with bristles distinctly seen by a moder- 
ate magnifier. Stalks of the spikelets rough and long, usu- 
ally undivided, sometimes, however, branched and carrying 
more than one spikelet. 

Rather rare. Adjacent to Crown Street, Aberdeen. 
In the neighbourhood of Banff. Mr. Gardiner, Melrose. â€” In 
Moray ; not indigenous. Mr. Stables. 

Annual â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” These three species, though not always placed in the same 
genus, have various points of resemblance, and they follow natur- 
ally enough the last member of the preceding genus, wherein the 
corolla has the fringed inner scale of a Bromus; while the 1st of 
the present group is without the fringe alluded to, and, indeed, the 
2d has it in no complete manner ; so that these two are thus so far 
akin to the Festucse. 

B. giganteus â€” which, with us, is not a " sea-side grass," as an emi- 
nent botanist calls it â€” is characterized by its great size, smooth stem 
and sheaths,* with broad, bare, ribbed, glossy, green leaves, much di- 
vided panicle, and long, usually tortuous awn, which far exceeds the 
valve to which it is attached, and is, indeed, several times the length 
of the rather small spikelets. B. asper is a still more gigantic grass, 
comparatively harsh and hairy, with an awn shorter than the florets, 
seldom one-fourth the length of the spikelets, which are fully an 
inch long, while those of B. giganteus scarcely exceed the half of that 
size. B. sterilis is distinguished from the two preceding species 
by being a smaller, feebler grass, the branches of its panicle mostly 
undivided, with awns far exceeding the flowers, and fully equal to 
the long spikelets. We might say of these three species compara- 
tively, that the 1st has short spikelets and long awns ; the 2d, long 
spikelets and short awns ; while the 3d, in a manner, combines the 
long awn of the 1st, with the long spikelet of the 2d. It is also to 
be recollected that, in the more expanded stage, both B. asper and 
sterilis have the flowers distinctly separate. 

There is a few flowered, pale variety of F. gigantea, called at one 
time F. triflora, which Mr. Cowie has observed in Banffshire ; not 
common in Scotland, but probably far from rare in adjacent portions 
of England, as I have noticed it in several parts of Cumberland. 

4. Bromus mollis. Soft Brome-grass. 

Stem about two feet high. Leaves as well as their sheaths, 
soft and downy. Panicle, for the most part, erect and close, 
though spreading when in full flower ; the branches variable, 
but never of great length, either simple or divided, occasion- 
ally in pairs, the lowest often in a whorled form. Spikelets 
downy, oblong, ovate, consisting of, from five to ten, i*ib- 

* Foreign writers, however, mention one variety in which the sheaths are downy. 
and another wherein they arc hispid.

bed, closely set flowers, with straight awns about their own 
length. 

Meadows, hay-fields, and waste places ; abundant. Various 
parts of the sea coast. 

Biennial â€” flowering in June. 

5. Bromus secalinus. Smooth Rye-brome-grass. 

Stems two or three feet high. Leaves large, slightly hairy. 
Panicle at first erect, afterwards spreading, and ultimately 
drooping ; its branches seldom divided. Spikelets large, 
bare, ovate ; the flowers about ten, cylindrical and remote. 
Outer scale of the corolla with a short and not quite straight 
awn ; the inner one fringed, with very distinct bristles. 

Among grain-crops, especially wheat ; but not common. 

Frequent among wheat in Kincardineshire. Mr. Chrystall. 
â€” On the farm of Mondurno, about A\ miles from Aberdeen. 
Mr. John Henderson, surgeon. â€” Corn fields in Drainy and at 
Spynie ; scarcely a native of Moray. Mr. Stables. 

Annual â€” flowering from July through the autumn. 

Obs. â€” The last of these species is indicated by the short awns and 
the cylindrical, compact, smooth, or minutely-downy flowers, which 
are at first close, but afterwards distinctly separate, their mid-stalk 
appearing between them. The inner scale of the corolla, too, is re- 
markable for strong, bristly teeth. B. mollis, known to every one as 
a sown grass, is an undoubted native, and may be usually recognized 
by the erect, close panicle, with the spikelets, leaves, and sheaths 
downy. This species, however, differs much as to downiness and 
the branching of the panicle, while the height, too, is very variable, 
being sometimes fully two feet; whereas, in very dry and exposed 
situations, it scarcely reaches more than a couple of inches. In 
short, the name is here used to comprehend no little variety of ap- 
pearance, but, as is believed, only one distinct species. There was 
at one time an intention to introduce in this place two other spe- 
cies, viz. B. velutinus (characterized by large but few spikelets, com- 
posed of numerous, crowded, downy flowers) and B. arvensis (a spe- 
cies known by the smoothish and often purplish spikelets), but it was 
afterwards concluded that some of the specimens in view might be 
referred to B. mollis ; while a few were mere varieties of the secalinus ; 
and others, found on the Aberdeen Inch, were so probably brought 
along with ballast,* as not to entitle them to be described as native 
species. In fact, B. secalinus is not properly indigenous, but brought 
from the south with seeds, particularly wheat. 



* Probably from the source alluded to, several grasses, as Panicum viride and 
Cms Galli, and Alopecurus agreslis, as well as other unexpected plants, have been 
met with upon this spot, the botanical merit of which has been lessened by the re- 
cent improvements. Alpine species, too, have been observed upon it, carried down 
by the Dee. 



T HI ANURIA.] AVENA. /7 

The species of Bromus are generally disliked by cattle. 
B. mollis is the best of them, and forms no inconsiderable 
portion of the hay-field in many parts of the north ; but of 
this grass Mr. Sinclair has a poor opinion indeed. It is at 
least liable to the objection that, being strictly annual, it does 
not appear again, if cut at an early stage ; whereas, if allowed 
to stand so long as to sow itself, the existing crop is of little 
value. There is, I understand, an opinion, in the counties 
of Angus and Kincardine, that B. secalinus communicates 
deleterious properties to the grain crop with which it may 
be mixed. , 

GENUS XXVIII. AVENA. 

Calyx of two thin, awnless scales Corolla of two un- 
equal scales, the outer cloven at the summit, Avith a 
twisted awn on its back, near the middle ; inner scale

panicle directed to one side. Calyx ribbed, containing two 
flowers, each of which has the outer scale of the corolla ter- 
minated by a pair of bristles, and, upon the middle of its 
back, the usual spiral awn of the genus. One of the flowers 
is on a short stalk, which has, at the top, a very small hairy 
tuft upon one side.

Root of several knots or bulbs, placed one above the other. 
Stem erect and tall. Leaves rather large. Panicle of a 
greenish-brown hue, spreading when hi flower, very long, 
with branches that are in some degree whorled, especially 
below. Calyx-scales unequal, shorter than the two con- 
tained flowers, the upper of which is perfect and barely 
awned, the lower imperfect, with a long, conspicuous awn. 
Seed coated with the hardened corolla. 

Corn fields, hedges, &c. ; common. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” The 3d and 4th species border closely upon one another ; 
and without venturing upon a general opinion regarding A. praten- 
sis and alpina, it may be suspected that the plants above alluded to 
under these names are but alpine and maritime varieties of the same 
species. We have various instances, in Aberdeenshire, of plants 
(I allude to species regarding which the same observation has not 



TIUANDIUA. 



ELYMUS. 7$ 



been made in other places) occurring both on the coast and in ele- 
vated parts of the interior, but entirely wanting for many interven- 
ing miles. Between Nos. 3. and 4. the readiest distinction will be 
derived from the subdivided and larger, though close panicle of the 
alpina, with its flat, broad, rough-edged leaves. From these two, 
A. pubescens (not to mention other marks) is sufficiently distinguished 
by the hairy or downy leaves. Should A. flavescens be met with in 
this part of the kingdom, of which I have as yet no satisfactory evi- 
dence, it will be detected by the numerous, yellowish, small spike- 
lets. The wild oat (fatua) has not been here introduced, and, in- 
deed, A. strigosa, well characterized by the bristles or short awns 
terminating each floret, is but a doubtful denizen. 

The last species (elatior) has, by some, been recently placed in a 
genus (Arrhenatherum), of which we have no other example ; but it 
has, commonly, been put in the genus Holcus. As the technical cha- 
racters, however, do not quite accord with the Holci, but approach 
just as near to the Avense, with which the aspect of the plant well 
corresponds, I am disposed to rank it with the present genus, and to 
recur to the name of Linnaeus. 

These Avense deserve no comment upon their agricultural 
properties, with the exception, perhaps, of the last species 
(elatior), the produce of which is great, though its nutri- 
tive qualities are rather of an inferior order \ and, upon dry 
soil, the roots become large bulbs, and prove a troublesome 
weed. Mr. Sinclair is of opinion that this grass should 
have a place in permanent pastures, though the proportion 
ought to be very limited. 

GENUS XXIX. ELYMUS. 

Main stalk of the spike toothed alternately at each side. 
Spikelets, two or more together, at each tooth. Calyx 
of two scales, containing a spikelet of several florets. 
Corolla also of two scales.

1. Elymus arenarius. Upright Sea Lyme-gr ass. 

Root creeping extensively. Stem several feet high, round,

long, and spinous at the points. They have a tendency to 
roll inward, and are remarkable for their glaucous hue, par- 
ticularly upon the upper surface, which is strongly furrowed. 
Stipule short. Spike upright, rather long and dense ; its 
three-flowered spikelets arranged in pairs at each tooth of

Obs. â€” The downy flowers, the spikelets in pairs, the rather 
dense and somewhat lobed spike, the short stipules, and the large 
leaves, remarkable for the greyish or bluish hue styled glaucous ; 
form a combination which, with moderate care, cannot be mistaken. 
Authors concur in mentioning that the plant is frequent, though 
rarely flowering ; but so far as the writer can form an opinion of 
it on the east and north-west coasts, he would say that it usually 
flowers, but is, in general, rather uncommon. 

My friend, Dr. Balfour, informs me that Dr. G. M'Nab, in 1835, 
met with an Elymus, in Forfarshire, " resembling much E. genicu- 
lates." Regarding Dr. M'Nab's plant I can give no opinion, but 
it is certain that his father and myself, several years ago, met with 
an Elymus, in Durness, Sutherland, which was then taken for the 
veritable E. geniculates â€” an extremely rare species, hitherto said only 
to occur at Gravesend â€” and I continue to be of the same opinion. 
The characters of E. geniculates are the following, well entitling it 
to rank as a distinct species : â€” " Spike bent perpendicularly down- 
ward, lax ; main stalk winged. Calyx awl-shaped, longer than the 
spikelets." The Sutherland specimens did not exhibit the first of 
those characters (from which the species derives its name), but this 
may have been owing to the stage. 

Elymus arenarius has been considered "the sugar-cane of 
Britain," as the nutritive matter afforded by it is remarkable 
for a large quantity of saccharine matter, amounting to more 
than one-third of its weight. This information is given by 
Sinclair, who adds, " the saccharine matter must render 
the hay made from this grass very nutritious, particularly 
when cut into chaff and mixed with corn or common hay/' 
The same author found that sand-hills which he examined in 
Lincolnshire " were formed by E. arenarius and Arundo are- 
naria ; the latter with its tufty habit of growth formed the 
summitof the hill, while the broad, spreading roots and leaves 
of Elymus arenarius secured the base and sides. These two 
grasses, when combined, seem admirably adapted, by Nature, 
for the purpose of forming a barrier to the encroachment of 
the sea. What sand the Arundo arenaria arrests and col-

lects about itself, the Elymus arenarius secures and keeps 
fast." This species, however, is not to be taken into any 
practical account in this quarter. At least, I have never seen 
a great quantity of it, except on a portion of the desolate 
tract which lies between Manse of Durness and Cape Rath. 
It has been suggested that E. arenarius is capable of being 
formed into ropes, as Stipa tenacissima is in Spain. 

GENUS XXX. HORDEUM. 

Flowers in threes at each tooth of the central stalk ; the 
two lateral being often stalked, and with stamens alone, 
the intermediate one sessile and perfect. Calyx of two 
slender, pointed or awned pieces. Outer scale of the 
corolla ending in an awn, which extends beyond those 
of the calyx ; inner smaller, and in the lateral flowers 
having often, at its back, a bristle- like body. Seed 
pointed at each end, with a narrow channel along the 
upper side, firmly coated with the corolla. 

SPECIES. 

1. Hordeum mm^inum. Wall Barley. 

Stem reclining at the base, then becoming erect. Leaves 
long, flat, bright-green, with rather loose, long sheaths. 
Spike two or three inches long, close, and brittle. Of the 
three florets placed together, the central is perfect and almost 
sessile ; with the scales of its calyx narrow-lanceolate, fringed 
with hairs, and ending in a long awn ; the two lateral ones 
stalked, and without pistils, their calyx-scales all bristle- 
like and rough.

Obs. â€” This rather rare grass is distinguished from any other 
Hordeum, by the calyx-scales of the intermediate flower having a 
fringe, which is very distinct, particularly when slightly magnified. 
By the want of this fringe, with the rougher awns and half- ovate 
form of the inner calyx-scales of the lateral flowers, we may detect 
H. maritimum, a species having considerable similarity to murinum, 
but smaller and more glaucous; which, though included in Don's 
list of Forfarshire plants, I do not venture to insert as a proper na- 
tive. H. pratense, frequent in England, but scarcely wild in any

Oes. â€” Moderate care will ascertain the present genus, which is 
well characterized by the two-ranked spike, the inner margin of each 
spikelet lying in a channel of the stalk, with the calyx of a single 
scale at the outer margin ; although, no doubt, there is, occasion- 
ally, at least, in L. temulentum, a small calyx- scale at the inner edge 
of the spikelet. The genus settled, little difficulty can occur with 
any Lolium ; as nothing can be more distinctive than the very evident 
awns of L. temulentum, with the calyx fully as long as the spikelet, 
when compared with the well-known points of common Rye-grass. 

Lolium arvense â€” common enough in the southern parts of Britain, 
and mentioned in the Flora Britannica, as occurring in fields to the 
north of Forfar â€” may be considered as a variety of L. temulentum, 



triandria] lolium. 83 

characterized by short, soft awns, smooth stem, and spikelets as 
long as the calyx. 

Rye-grass is said to have been cultivated, in England, in 
the seventeenth century, and it was long before any other 
grass was put to the same use. Forty or fifty years ago, 
Phleum pratense was probably introduced ; and, about the 
same time, seeds of Dactylis glomerata, though a native 
species, are said to have been brought from Virginia. No 
trial of it was, however, made at that time, but more re- 
cently its cultivation has been practised aud recommended 
by Mr. Coke ; so that, accoi'ding to Mr. Sinclair, it has 
superseded the Bye-grass, in some districts of England. It 
is but lately that Alopecurus pratensis has been tried for 
similar purposes, upon an extensive scale, chiefly by the 
praises of Mr. Curtis, an excellent judge of the botanical 
and economical qualities of grasses. 

The properties of Lolium perenne are well known. It 
may, however, be doubted whether it ought to hold, among 
sown grasses, the prominent place that it does in this quar- 
ter. Regarding this important grass a few quotations may 
be given. 

Professor Martyn says, in his Flora Rustica (1792), 
" How long this grass may have been in cultivation I am 
not able to ascertain. Neither Gerard (1597), nor his re- 
publisher, Johnson (1836), nor Parkinson (1649), give the 
least hint of any use to which it is applied. None of the 
writers on husbandry, of the last century, say a word in its 
commendation, or insinuate that any particular species of 
grass was sown in laying down land. * * * How 
the Rye-grass came to have been originally selected from 
all the rest we cannot say. Probably it was accident, or 
because it is common, and the seeds are easily collected. 
* * * That the Rye-grass should still be the only sort 
whose seed is to be had in any quantity in the shops is a 
disgrace to this age and nation." 

The following observations are from Sinclair's Hortus 
Gramineus : â€” " There has been much difference of opinion 
respecting the merits and comparative value of Rye-grass. 
It produces an abundance of seed, which is easily collected, 
and readily vegetates on most kinds of soil. It soon arrives 
at perfection, and produces, in its first years of growth, a 
good supply of early herbage, which is much liked by cattle. 
These merits have, no doubt, upheld it till the present day 
in practice, and will, probably, for some time to come, con- 
tinue it a favourite grass with many farmers. But the after- 

F 2

math of Rye-grass is very inconsiderable, and the plant im- 
poverishes the soil in a high degree, if the culms, which are 
invariably left untouched by cattle, are not cut before the seed 
advances towards perfection. Let the produce and nutritive 
powers of Rye-grass be compared with those of the Cock's- 
foot-grass, and it will be found inferior nearly in the pro- 
portion of 5 to 18, and also inferior to the Meadow Fox-tail 
in the proportion of 5 to 12, and inferior to the Meadow 
Fescue in the proportion of 5 to 17-"* Sir J. Smith says of 
this species, " It yields an early crop of hay upon high or 
sandy lands, and makes a fine turf, which, however, is said 
not to be lasting, except on a rich soil. Much valuable infor- 
mation concerning its cultivation and merits is collected by 
Professor Hooker, in his Continuation of the Flora Londinensis. 
The result seems to be that this grass is best suited to the 
light land of Norfolk, where it first obtained its reputation. "f 

From this common and useful species of Lolium we pass 
to L. temulentum, which is interesting for qualities of a dif- 
ferent kind â€” namely, for being rare, indeed, scarcely indi- 
genous, and the only one of the true grasses which can be 
said to be possessed of decidedly deleterious qualities. That 
Darnel is possessed of intoxicating qualities, both ancient 
and modern writers agree. It was observed by Linnreus, 
of this species, that, if malted with barley, the ale soon pro- 
duces giddiness ; and, baked into bread, it is'known to oc- 
casion deleterious effects. A considerable extent of ground 
has been observed to be cultivated with Darnel in the neigh- 
bourhood of London, perhaps, with the view of its being add- 
ed to fermented liquors, to increase their intoxicating effects. 
Cases illustrating the symptoms produced by this species are 
recorded in Stephenson and Churchill's Medical Botany, from 
which work these remarks upon it are mainly culled. 

Lolium temulentum is the Aira of the Greeks, and the 
" infelix lolium" of the Roman poet : 

" interque nitentia culta, 

Infelix lolium et steriles doiuinantur a venae." 



* For the purpose of ascertaining the comparative value of the produce of differ- 
ent grasses, it has been recommended to submit the same quantity of each, either 
in a green or dry state, to the action of hot water for some time. The liquid part 
is afterwards to be separated by filtration, and, lastly, evaporated to dryness. The 
solid product is to be considered the nutritive matter of the grass. 

â– f Many new, and it is thought improved, varieties of L. perenne have of late 
been observed. Mr. Whitworth's collection, in 1823, amounted to sixty. A variety 
distinguished from common Rye-grass, by greater size and a deeper green colour 
(Lolium perenne Ilalicum, Italian Rye-grass), is cultivated in Italy and Germany. 
Mr, Thomson of Banchory procured a few seeds of it, at Munich, and communi- 
cated tliese to Mr. Charles Lawsoii, Edinburgh, who gives a report on the plant in

It is considered the Zizania or Zinzania of the Arabians , 
and it has been thought probable that the meaning of Ziza- 
nia, occurring in the following and other parts of the 13th 
chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, would have been better 
translated by Darnel than by Tares : "rfKQev dvTov 6 ix&pos km

SPECIES. 

1 . Triticum junceum. Sea Rushy Wheat-grass. 
Agropyrum junceum. Lindleys Synopsis. 

Root widely creeping. Stem smooth, one or two feet 
high. Leaves, like the whole plant, glaucous, tapering to a 
point, with a tendency to be rolled up ; their stipules very 
short. Spike long ; spikelets rather distant. Calyx of two 
many-ribbed, bluntish scales, containing four or five smooth, 
awnless florets. 

Frequent on sand-hills near the sea. â€” Rather common at Aber-

alternately, with slight projections where the rather close 
spikelets are attached. Calyx of two many-ribbed scales, 
tapering to a point, enclosing from four to eight florets.

Root fibrous, not creeping. Leaves long and flat. Spike 
three or four inches long, but sometimes of a far greater 
length. Calyx slightly awned, with three, sometimes five 
ribs, containing about four florets, with long, rough awns. 

Ferhaps not uncommon ; but, probably, often confounded with 

the preceding. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” Though, in general, the aspect of the 1st species is suffi- 
ciently marked, a small variety of it makes no slight approach to the 
more awnless state of T. repens ; but the distant spikelets and blunt 
calyx of the former is different enough from the closer spikelets 
and pointed calyx of the latter. It ought, however, to be observed 
that, though authors call the leaves of T. junceum, involute, as well as 
those of Elymus arenarius, both these species have here been described 
as only having a tendency to be rolled up; for the fact is that, 
though they assume this form in an advanced stage, or after the 
plant is detached from the ground, they will be found quite flat, 
in both species, in the young, growing condition. It is also to be 
recollected that there is, at least upon the English coast, and pro- 
bably also upon that of Scotland, a variety of T. repens, sometimes 
confounded with junceum and even with Elymus arenarius ; having a 
broad, close spike and long spikelets; wherein, according to the spe- 
cimens that I have seen, the leaves are rolled up. As to T. cani- 
num ; it is sufficiently distinguished by the absence of a creeping 
root, and by the long, slender spike, with very conspicuous awns, 
the spikelets having, in no small degree, the aspect of a long-awned 
Festuca or Bromus. 

It may be added, that it is just possible for a doubt to exist, in 
some cases, between the genera Lolium and Triticum ; and though 
the mostly single calyx- scale of the former maybe conclusive enough, 
the arrangement of the spikelets will be found, in general, a good 
practical distinction. These lie, in Lolium, as already mentioned, 
with their inner edges in the channels of the mid-stalk, whereas, in 
Triticum, the middle of the flat surface is over the channel; so that, 
in the former genus, the central stalk of the spike is quite uncovered 
from end to end, while in Triticum it is mostly concealed by the 
spikelets. 

Triticum junceum may be alluded to as one of the species 
which perform the important effect of binding the loose sand 
upon our coasts. T. repens is a most troublesome weed, 
conspiring with Avena elatior, Holcus mollis, and others, to 
become the pest of corn fields. In gardens, it is still more 
common, forming the main part of the Squitch or Couch of 
gardeners â€” corruptions of quick (living), referring to the 
strong, vital properties of the roots. Authors mention that

at Naples, these roots are collected in large quantities and 
sold in the market to feed horses, and that they have a sweet 
taste, approaching to that of liquorice, and, when dried and 
ground to meal, they are said to have been made into bread, 
in years of scarcity ; also, that Boerhaave recommends the 
juice of these roots in jaundice and scirrhous liver ; and that 
cattle are frequently found to have scirrhous liver in winter, 
which is cured soon when turned out to grass in the spring. 
It is well known that dogs, by means of these leaves, excite 
vomiting ; an effect, perhaps, mechanically produced by their 
roughness. 

The long, articulated roots of this grass are known under 
the name of Chiendent, in France, where they extract sugar 
from this substance, and frequently employ it in the forma- 
tion of a diluent, diuretic decoction. I observe, too, in a re- 
cent French medical work, the decoction of bruised Chiendent 
extolled in " ureihrite" ; and also in a febrile affection, 
which may be considered similar to our common fever â€” a 
practice which might be occasionally worth adopting in re- 
mote country parts. The leaves of T. repens are so rough 
that horses and cattle scarcely touch them. Mr. Sinclair, 
however, thinks T. caninum of considerable value, particu- 
cularly as affording early herbage, in a degree superior to 
Lolium perenne or even Anthoxanthum odoratum ; and that, 
on soils of inferior quality, it might be cultivated to advan- 
tage instead of Rye-grass.

Plentiful near Montrose. Hooker's Flora Scotica. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” The present genus is readily recognized by the dense 
heads of flowers, each with a double calyx ; and as to the species, 
we cannot fail to distinguish the 1st by its almost entire leaves, 
as compared with the deeply-cut condition of at least some of the 
leaves in both the others. In the 3d sp. the leaves and flowers are 
more delicate than in the 2d ; and, as a conclusive distinction, it is 
enough to repeat, that the segments of the corolla are five, in S. 
columbaria ; and but four, in arvensis. I have never met with the 
3d sp. in the neighbourhood of Montrose, nor do any of my friends 
appear to have been more successful ; and some degree of error may 
therefore be suspected in the above account of its being plentiful 
near Montrose, although probably derived from the Curator of the 
Glasgow Botanic Garden. Dr. Balfour has, however, favoured me 
with a specimen from a more southern part of the same county, 
and writes that this species has been observed by Dr. G. M'Nab, 
to be common near Arbroath, where, indeed, Mr. G. Don had noticed 
it many years before. 

Hooker notices that the term Scabiosa is derived from 
Scabies ; the decoction or infusion of some of the species 
having formerly been employed in curing cutaneous diseases. 
In France, S. arvensis is still thought of use " contre la 
gale, les dartres, et autres maladies de la peau" ; and a tea 
procured from this herb is there prescribed to be drunk 
hot, in slight attacks of Bronchitis. To S. succisa, many 
virtues were once attributed. Indeed, it is recorded that the 
Devil, envious of its qualities, bit off the root in his rage, and 
he must, it has been observed, have carried away with him 
the whole properties of the plant, no one in these latter times 
having observed any virtue in it.

stalk springing from the bosom of each, and carrying a pair 
of minute leaves and about eight yellow flowers, of which 
some want the pistil. Fruit smooth.

of a golden-yellow, very numerous, in dense, tufted panicles, 
annexed to the stem in the manner of branches. 

In dry places: very common. â€” Frequent at Aberdeen; as

Perennial â€” flowering in August. 

Obs. â€” These two species are separated from the succeeding mem- 
bers of the genus by the yellow flowers and smooth fruit, while the 
ovate, hairy, comparatively broad leaves, four in a whorl, sufficiently 
distinguish G. cruciatum from verum. The former of these is one 
of the species in a list of plants given in Anderson s Guide, as rare 
or unknown in the north of Scotland ; and it is remarkable that this 
species should be rather abundant throughout the southern parts of 
the island, but with us so rare, that it, perhaps, only occurs when 
the seeds have been transported from other quarters.

at the edges, obtuse, with a small point. Flowers white, 
but at first pink. Fruit reddish when young ; in the last

Everywhere, in dry woods, moors, and mountains. 

Mr. Watson found it, in the north of Scotland, fully 1000 
yards high. 

Perennial â€” flowering throughout the summer. 

Obs. â€” These three Galiums, like other three which immediately fol- 
low, are characterized by white flowers, and the fruit without bristles. 
G. palustre is known by the leaves being blunt without a bristle, 
rather long, and sometimes unequal ; G. uliginosum, by the bristle- 
pointed leaves and rough stem ; and G. saxatile, by the granulated 
fruit, smooth stem, and blunt, though bristle-pointed leaves, which 
are of an ovate form, and broader than in either of the others. It 
should also be recollected that the two first are usually found in 
wet, and the last in dry situations ; and it may be added that G. 
uliginosum has not the same tendency to turn black in drying as the 
two others have. 

It is necessary to allude to a Galium resembling G. palustre, 
but with the leaves and angles of the stem rough, from reversed 
prickles, which isG. Witheringii of English Botany an&English Flora, 
though Hooker rather considers it a variety of G. palustre. Not hav- 
ing particularly examined the subject, I shall only add that the plant 
alluded to appears not to be uncommon, and has been observed by 
Mr. Dickie, in the vicinity of Aberdeen ; by Mr. Shier, near Peter- 
head ; and by Lord Aberdeen, in the vicinity of Haddo House.

set with small prickles, pointing forwards. Flowers milk-

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” These three species have the flowers and fruit like the pre- 
ceding group; and have among themselves no other bond of union, 
except it may be their rareness. G. Mollugo, a scarcely indigenous 
species, may be detected by the very long stem, with the whorls of 
eight rather large, bristle-pointed leaves. As to G. pusillum ; though 
it appears probable that this name has been given at times to varieties 
of more than one of our common species, there can be little or no doubt 
that it is a well-marked Galium, remarkable for hairy, close whorls, 
and for the numerous stems, which form large tufts, covered with 
innumerable milk-white flowers, conspicuous at a distance. This 
species is found also in Ireland and England ; but some doubt has 
been entertained as to whether the Scottish and Irish specimens are 
identical with the species found in England. Dr. Hooker observes 



TETRANDIUA.] GALIUM. 93 

that his specimens, " under this name, from Ireland, are totally free 
from pubescence, and have the leaves very closely imbricated all 
the way up, in which particular it does not accord with the E. B. 
figure." Linnaeus particularly notices the closeness of the whorls in 
the Species Plantarum, 154, " Foliorum verticilli ssepe ita conferti, 
ut folia imbricatim digesta conspiciantur."* It is stated in the British 
Flora â€” but upon what grounds I know not â€” that foreign authors 
seem to be little, if at all acquainted with this species. Regarding 
G. aristatum, I know nothing, and I have copied the description of it 
from the English Flora ; but I may venture to remark that it seems 
a good species, and is probably indigenous. 

Owing to the uncertainty that hangs over them, three species 
belonging to this section, introduced into the Flora Scotica as na- 
tives of Forfarshire, are at present omitted, viz. : G. diffusum, ver- 
rucosum, and spurium. Judging from descriptions and the figures 
of Vaillant, these are species with which I have never met ; nor is 
it certain that the Forfarshire plants alluded to may not have been 
of accidental and temporary growth. Moreover, it must be admitted 
that no little obscurity and even discrepancy among authors exists 
regarding the species above named ; and, on the whole, it seems 
best to omit them, particularly as the stations given in the Scottish 
Flora can barely be said to come within the sphere of the present 
observations. 

*** Fruit bristly. 

9. Galium boreale. Cross-leaved Bed-straw. 

Stem erect, square, branched. Leaves with three or more 
distinct nerves, but no hairs, lanceolate, tapering towards 
the point, four in each whorl. Flowers numerous, white, in 
a very branched panicle, with two small, ovate leaves at 
each of its divisions. Fruit clothed with hooked bristles. 

Chiefly in alpine and maritime places, sometimes on river 
sides ; far from general. â€” A little above the Bridge of Dee, at 
Aberdeen ; and between this Bridge and Craiglug. Also, at 
Charlestown and Ballater, and probably to be found occasionally 
on most parts of Deeside ; but absent or very rare upon Donside.

quainted than any one with the highest parts of Don, cannot re-

10. Galium Aparine. Goose-grass or Cleavers. 

Stem angled, weak, supporting itself upon other plants, 
often several feet long. Leaves eight in a whorl, narrow- 
lanceolale, with hooked prickles on their margins and keels, 
as well as on the angles of the stem. Flowers whitish, or 
of a pale, buff-colour, two or three together, upon stalks, 
rising from the bosom of the leaves. The fruit is two, rather 
large, roundish lobes, covered with hooked bristles. 

Common; chiefly in hedges. â€” At Aberdeen, between the 
Canal and Powder Magazine ; Ferryhill, &c. &c. 
Annual â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” These two Galiums are easily determined, being distin- 
guished from all the other British species by the bristly fruit; and 
from one another, by the bare, three-nerved leaves of G. boreale, 
four in a whorl, as compared with the whorls of eight prickly leaves 
in G. Aparine. 

The flowers of G. verum are said to coagulate boiling- 
milk, and it seems that the quality of cheese made in this 
way, was at one time thought to be superior. One of our 
Herbalists, writing about 200 years ago, observes, " The 
people of Cheshire, especially about Namptwich, where the 
best cheese is made, do use it in their Rennet, esteeming 
greatly that cheese above other made without it." The know- 
ledge of the effect of this Galium upon milk was not con- 
fined to Cheshire. Sir John Hill says, " the flowers of this 
plant contain a latent acid ; they will curdle milk. The 
country people call the plant cJieese-renning." G. verum is, 
moreover, the caille-lait jaune of the French, and there 
seems no doubt that the property alluded to was known to 
the ancients, from whom, like not a few other facts and 
opinions, it, perhaps, descended to the old Herbalists, and 
from them to our common people.* Our authors mention 
that the French prescribe the flowers of G. verum in epi- 
leptic and hysterical attacks ; but beyond a single notice of 
the plant being antispasmodic, I have met with no allusion 
to its effect by modern French writers. The roots of this

lard, was considered, by the Greeks, to be useful in discus- 
sing glandular swellings ; but Dr. Cullen relates that he 
tried the Aparine in some indurations of this kind, without 
any advantage. This plant has also been extolled in drop- 
sies and the complaints termed scorbutic, either in the form 
of an expressed juice, or a tea prepared from the dried herb. 
The roasted seeds of G. Aparine are said to be no bad sub- 
stitute for coffee, and it has been observed that, if raised 
for a crop, they might, perhaps, have the additional recom- 
mendation to some people, of being very much dearer. 

GENUS III. ASPERULA. 

Calyx of four small teeth, superior, falling off. Corolla 
of one petal, funnel-shaped, four-cleft. Fruit two, 
naked, united, globular seeds, not crowned by the 
calyx. 

SPECIES. 

1. Asperula odorata. Woodruff or Woodroof. 

Stem unbranched, six or eight inches high, clothed with 
four or five whorls of about eight leaves, which are oval, 
tapering at the base, with a minute thorn at the point. 
Flowers very white, at the top of the stem, upon rather long 
stalks, which branch into a panicle-like form. 

Shady places ; but by no means abundant. â€¢ â€” Near Aberdeen, 
at the Corby Den, Maryculter. Vale of Alford, on the banks 
of the burn of Linturk. Lochmuik. Buchan, in the Den of 
Auchmedden and other places. Ardo, near Oldmeldrum.

tifully, between Inchrory and Loch Builg. Mr. Proctor. â€”

Moray. Mr. Stables. â€” Sutherland. Mr. Watson. 
Perennial â€” flowering in the early part of summer. 

Obs. â€” It is remarked, in the English Botany, that the name, 
Woodruff, alludes to the whorled position of the leaves, like an 
old-fashioned ruff, and that Woodroof is a corruption of it ; also, 
that the fresh herb has no smell ; but as soon as it begins to dry 
it exhales a pleasant and lasting fragrance, like that of new hay, 
verging towards the flavour of bitter almonds. It is not impossible 



96 SHERARDIA. PLANTAGO. [tetrandria. 

that there may be a minute formation of Prussic acid both in this 
plant and Anthoxanthum odoratum, when in a drying state. The 
smell countenances this opinion ; and I have often felt headach and 
giddiness from being in a hay-field upon a hot day. 

Asperula odorata has been used for giving a flavour to 
wine, though, considering the above conjecture, the practice 
may not be entirely without risk. " It is reported to be put 
into wine to make a man merry." So it is said in an old 
Herbal ; and if the combination be liberally enough made 
use of, it will doubtless lead to the specified effect ! 

GENUS IV. SHERARDIA. 

Calyx permanent, of one leaf with six teeth. Corolla of 
one funnel-shaped petal. Fruit of two, united, naked 
seeds, each crowned with three teeth from the calyx. 

SPECIES. 

1. Sherardia arvensis. Blue Sherardia. 

Stems several, not erect, a few inches long. Leaves about 
six in a whorl, entire, oval, pointed, tapering at the base. 
Flowers small, pale-blue, in a kind of sessile umbel at the 
extremity of the plant. Fruit of two oblong, united seeds, 
each marked with three green lines, corresponding to the 
teeth of the calyx, by which the summit is crowned. 

Not uncommom in dry fields ; but probably never remote from 
cultivation. In the neighbourhood of Aberdeen and Stonehaven. 
Rather rare in the district of Alford. 

Annual â€” flowering in the summer months. 

Obs. â€” I shall only refer to the small, pale-blue flowers, placed 
at the end of the plant, with the nearly prostrate stem and the leaves 
in whorls, whereof the upper form a kind of collar to the heads of 
flowers. The genus is named " in honour of James Sherard, an 
English Botanist, and Patron of Botany." 

GENUS V. PLANTAGO. 

Calyx of one leaf, in four permanent segments. Corolla 
tubular, four-cleft, ultimately membranous, the seg-

often as long as themselves or longer. Spikes tapering, 
very long and dense, with a few distant flowers at the base ; 
their stalks round, naked, and radical. Capsule membranous, 
with two cells separated by a green longitudinal partition, 
which ultimately becomes loose ; each cell containing several 
seeds. 

Sides of roads and fields ; common. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June, &c.

son). Mr. F. Adams. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

3. Plantago lanceolate. Ribwort Plantain. 

Leaves lanceolate, mostly entire, tapering at the base into 
a stalk, upon which, as well as on the lower part of the 
flower-stalk, there are often tufts of woolly hairs. Flower- 
stalks long, angular, twisted, smooth or slight!)' downy ; each 
bearing a short, brownish, ovate spike. Cells of the cap- 
sule one-seeded. 

Very common ; occasionally wild, though oftener in culti- 
vated places. Aberdeen Links ; Rubislaw, &c.

tire, though sometimes slightly toothed, channelled above, 
projecting below. Flowers in long, slender, cylindrical 
spikes, which are upon long, round, bare stalks springing 
from the root. 

Rather common on the coast and the mountains. Also, 
occasionally, in the intervening tract. â€” Old-Aberdeen Links ; 
and on the coast of "Buchan, Banff, and Kincardine. Occasion-

North coast of Sutherland. Mr. H. C. Watson. 
* â€” flowering from June to August. 

Obs. â€” The last two species require no comment regarding their 
distinguishing marks. It may, however, be observed, that although 
P. maritima is by no means confined to the coast, the Coronopus is, 
in the North, so far as is known to me, exclusively a maritime 
plant. Is Hooker correct in stating that, in Scotland, this species 
is found in inland places ? It certainly is so, upon the Continent ; 
being at least abundant in the environs of Paris. 

It may be repeated that P. media is undoubtedly rare with us ; and, 
indeed, there is reason to suspect that it is but seldom found, in any part 
of Scotland â€” a rather remarkable fact, considering how common it 
appears to be, in the south of Britain. English botanists find some- 
times a difficulty in distinguishing this species from P. major ; the 
usual means of doing so being derived from the consideration that, in 
the former, each cell contains but a single seed ; whereas, in the lat- 
ter, there are several seeds in the cell â€” a distinction precise enough, 
and sufficiently notable, as occurring in two species so much akin. 
Perhaps, a good practical distinction between the two plants resides 
in the spikes and their stalks, which might be adopted when the stage 
is unsuitable to distinguishing them, by the contents of the seed ves- 
sel. The spike in P. major is longer than in the media, while its 
stalk is greatly shorter ; and, indeed, according to my own speci- 
mens, the flower-stalks, in the latter, are five or six times as long 



* The duration of tliis species lias not been noticed above. Our common autho- 
rities call it annual. Mr. G. C. Smith, however, informs me that it is perennial; 
and Mr. Hopkirlc is of the same opinion. It is worthy of mention that Linnams is 
silent upon this point, in the Species Plantarum. 



TETRANDRIA.] CENTUN'CULUS. 99 

as the spike ; whereas, in P. major, the length of the two parts is 
often nearly equal. It is worth adding that, according to my limited 
experience of P. media, the spike, in this species, is more or less 
thickened at the extremity; whereas it hecomes narrower towards . 
the point, hoth in P. major and lanceoluta. 

An ov&te-\ea.vedvariety of P. lanceolata, met with in several places â€” 
as on the Buchan coast, Aberdeen Links, and in the vicinity of Haddo 
House â€” has, in various instances, been taken for P. media; but the 
angled, furrowed, twisted stem of the former species might alone pre- 
vent such a mistake. Moreover, the silvery, shaggy appearance of 
the spike, caused by the colour of the corolla, and the prominent 
long-remaining filaments (though this last mark is sometimes ob- 
served in P. lanceolata) are enough for distinguishing P. media from 
other species of this genus. A rather small variety of P. lanceoluta has 
been met with near Loch Kinnord, in Cromar, and upon the hill of 
Coull ; with the leaves as narrow as in P. maritima, and the flowers 
in small globular heads. I have also met with this species, both at 
Strichen and near Aberdeen, with numerous, small, roundish heads, 
upon stalks, in the manner of an umbel. Plantago major under- 
goes many changes, though 1 have not observed any of its transforma- 
tions in this quarter. A rose-spiked variety has been long known ; 
and another, with the inflorescence in a kind of loose panicle, has 
been noticed since the times of our oldest botanists, " although it 
be somewhat hard to be found," as is observed by Gerarde, or rather 
by his editor, Johnson. 

P. media has (or had lately) a place in some of the Con- 
tinental Pharmacopoeias, on account of astringent properties, 
possessed, indeed, by the Plantains in general. They are 
very old ophthalmic remedies, and, in France, at this day, 
a water distilled from the first three of the above species, is 
prescribed for slight inflammations of the eyes. Sir John 
Hill calls this genus " astringent, cooling, and healing. A 
water is distilled from it, but this is of small value, for these 
are not virtues that rise in distillation." The Plantain leaf 
is not a little prized by country people as an application to 
fresh wounds. These plants have also been recommended in 
spitting of blood and diarrhoea, as well as for a gargle in 
slight sore throats, and might sometimes be found an 
eligible prescription by the rural practitioner, either in 
infusion or in dry powder, to the extent of at least half a 
drachm.

SPECIES. 

1. Centuneulus minimus. Bastard Pimpernel. 
Plant minute, smooth. Stem erect, from a few lines 
to an inch and a half high. Leaves alternate, sometimes 
nearly opposite, ovate, blunt, entire. Flowers seated in the 
bosom of the leaves, greenish-white or red, of very short 
duration. 

Rare; but, perhaps, occasionally overlooked from its small size. 
In Moray, on the coast east of Nairn ; west from Stotfield ; 
sides of Loch of Spynie. Mr. Stables. 

Annual â€” flowering in June and July. 

GENUS VII. CORNUS. 

Calyx with four minute teeth. Corolla of four petals 
without a nectary. Nut with two cells. 

SPECIES. 

1. Cornus suecica. Dwarf Cornel. 

Stem herbaceous, a few inches high. Leaves sessile, 
ovate, opposite, with several distinct nerves. Flowers 
small, dark-purple, in an umbellate form, surrounded by 
four whitish leaves, which are petal-like, and called an invo- 
lucre. The umbel is upon a stalk, standing between two 
branches, which are short at first, but longer when the fruit 
is ripe. Fruit red, sweetish. 

Alpine and inland situations ; not rare. â€” Loch-na-gar, in the 
descent towards Invercauld. Glenbucket, near the Manse, and, 
perhaps, not farther down than this in Aberdeenshire. I have 
also found it in the interior of Sutherland. 

Abundant on all the mountains of Clova and Braemar. I 
picked very large and luxuriant specimens, in fruit, at the upper 
part of Glen Dole, to the north of the Falls. Dr. Balfour. â€” 
Lochlee. Mr. D. Lyall.â€” Hills' about Glen Callader. Mr. 
A. K. Clarke. â€” Ben Avon. Mr. Chrystall. â€” Corgarff, near 
Tornahaish. Mr. Proctor. â€” Corriemoulie, Glascarnoch, Kin- 
lochluchairt, Achnanaut, Achnashun, in Ross-shire â€” where I 
have gathered it both in flower and fruit, but it is not common 
in fruit. Mr. G. C. Smith. Mr. Watson observed Cornus suecica, 
on our northern mountains, sometimes nearly as high as 900 
yards. 

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” This is a remarkable plant with which, upon first inspec- 
tion, I was considerably puzzled. Dr. D. Skene, too, was at no 
little loss about this species, upon receiving a specimen found upon 
Morven, in Aberdeenshire, from Principal Campbell, who occasion- 
ally resided at the foot of that mountain : " Hrec planta, quam ac-

gaudet structura. * * An sine calyce, an sine petalis ? Folia 4 
magna plana radii dixi corollam, solummodo, ex colore et facie. 
* * * Nullam vero talem plantam invenio in Linn. v. Hudson." 
There can be no doubt that even Ray, from his words, " flos huic 
tetrapetalos," mistook the umbel for a single flower with four white 
petals. 

Lightfoot mentions that the berries of Cora us suecica are 
supposed, by the Highlanders, to create a great appetite. 

GENUS VIII. PARIETARIA.* 

Involucre various. Calyx inferior, of one leaf, in four 
segments. Corolla none. Filaments at first curved, then 
expanding with elastic force. Seed invested with the 
enlarged calyx. Some flowers are without stamens, 
their calyx remaining unaltered. 

SPECIES. 

1. Parietaria officinalis. Pellitory of the Wall. 

Stem angular, hairy. Leaves between ovate and lance- 
olate, three-nerved above the base, alternate, stalked. In- 
volucre of seven ovate segments, surrounding three flowers, 
of which the central is imperfect. 

Walls of old buildings ; but not common, and scarcely a native. 

Angus-shire, near Craig House. Mr. White. (I have also 
met with it farther south, a little beyond the strict range of the 
present publication, viz. on the old Abbey of Arbroath.) â€” Walls 
of Arbuthnott House, in the Mearns. Mr. Chrystall. â€” Aber- 
deenshire, upon the old Castle of Tolquhon. Earl of Aberdeen ; 
and at Inverugie. Mr. Cow, surgeon. â€” Boyne Castle, Banff- 
shire. Rev. W. Cowie.â€” In Moray, but not indigenous. Mr. 
Stables. 

Perennial â€” flowering from June to September. 

This plant was formerly in repute medicinally, but I 
cannot discover it in any recent Pharmacopoeia, British or 
foreign. A French author observes that Parietaria officinalis 
is an excellent diuretic, and he ascribes this effect to nitre 
contained in the plant : " Celte plante est un excellent diure- 
tigue ; ce quelle doit, sans chute cm nitrate de potasse, qu'elle 
contient en grande abondance. Etant cuite, elle est emollient e 
et usitee en cataplasme, applique sur les parties enflammees." 
These virtues, real or supposed, possess an interest in France, 
where the plant is to be observed in great abundance ; but 

31 The name is from paries, a wall â€” the species often growing on old walls. 



102 ALCHEMILLA. [tetrakuhia. 

with us it is in so small quantity, indeed scarcely indigen- 
ous, that its merits are little likely to be put to any trial. 

GENUS IX. ALCHEMILLA. 

Calyx inferior, of one tubular piece, the-upper part in 
eight segments, four of these smaller than the rest, 
and at the outside. Fruit of one or two naked 
seeds, but covered by the closed calyx. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Alchemilla vulgaris. Common Lady's Mantle. 

Root long, blackish, tough, throwing out fibres. Stem 
not quite erect, branched, ending in numerous clusters of 
small greenish flowers. Root-leaves upon long stalks, large 
and plaited, approaching to the kidney-shape, with many 
lobes, which have pointed teeth ; upper leaves similar, but 
smaller j their stalks shorter or almost Avanting, with a pair 
of notched united stipules to each. 

Cry pastures, banks of streams, and hill-sides ; common. â€” 
Aberdeen, on the Old-Town Links, and Banks of Dee and Don. 

North of Caithness ; Clova and Braemar mountains, at an 
elevation of 750 yards. Mr. H. C. Watson. 

Perennial â€” flowering from June to August. 

2. Alchemilla alpina. Alpine Lady's Mantle. 

Upper leaves nearly sessile, the lowest on long silvery 
stalks, divided to the very base into lobes, which are in- 
versely ovate, serrated at the point, dull greyish-green above, 
and satiny on the under surface. Inflorescence similar to 
that of the preceding. 

Mountains and inland situations, abundant. Sometimes 
transported by water. â€” At Aberdeen, both above and below the 
Bridge of Dee, and occasionally in small quantity upon the 
Inch. Deeside, above Charlestown ; Lochmuik ; Loch-na-gar ; 
and abounding in the alpine tract adjacent to the highest parts 
of Dee. Gairnside. Inch More, near the source of Don ; and

3. Alchemilla arvensis. Field Lady' s Mantle. 

Aphanes arvensis. Linn. â€” Light f oof s Flora Scotica. 

Stems numerous, several inches long, scarcely branching, 
more or less prostrate. Leaves, like the whole plant downy 
or hairy, for the most part in three lobes which are irregu- 
larly and deeply cut, upon short stalks, from which stipules 
partly arise. Flowers small, green, axillary. 

Dyke tops and thin soils ; not very frequent. â€” Aberdeen, at 
Rubislaw, Nigg, Balgownie, &c. 

Buchan. Rev. G. Gardiner. â€” Banffshire. Rev. "W. Cowie. â€” 
Golspie, Sutherland. Mr. H. C. Watson. 

Annual â€” flowering throughout summer. 

Obs. â€” The 2d sp. is well characterized by the beautiful, silken, 
under surface of the digitate leaves; as the 1st is by the large, 
roundish, lobed, plaited leaves. These species have, on the whole, 
a considerable similarity ; while the arvensis, though essentially an 
Alchemilla, bears little resemblance, in appearance, to the two others, 
but maybe detected by the above description. In Aberdeenshire, A. 
alpina is mainly confined to the vicinity of Dee and Don ; though it 
maybe seen above, that it has been met with in the intermediate tract, 
viz. on Morven and Gairnside. Upon Donside it is seldom if ever 
found below Strathdon ; while on Banks of Dee it grows strictly indi- 
genous, at least as low as Charlestown of Aboyne. Indeed, it will pro- 
bably be found occasionally throughout the whole course of this last 
river; butwhether, in all cases, transported, when below the point just 
mentioned, I cannot tell. A friend mentions that he has been quite 
satiated with the sight of A. alpina, upon the mountains of Ross-shire. 
The plant singly is no doubt highly elegant, but it has, in the mass, a 
melancholy air, and too often is the sole object meeting the eye in 
upland situations. For instance, it is but a cheerless sight to the 
alpine herborizer, ascending some of the steep Braemar mountains 
in a midsummer-day, to find, upon gaining each successive summit, 
nothing to repay his toil but the never-ending sad Alchemilla, wav- 
ing and rustling in the slight breeze, which barely suffices to fan his 
burning brow. 

It has been remarked that the name of this genus is Lady's (not 
Ladies') Mantle ; as it means the mantle of Our Lady (the Virgin 
Mary). 

I cannot discover that any property, worthy of notice, has 
ever been attributed to any species of Alchemilla, except the 
last, which has been said to be diuretic, and also to be use- 
ful in gravel and stone. To this virtue several of its names 



104

have reference â€” as Breakstone, Parsley Piert, and Percepier 
Anglorum. The two last terms are of similar import to the 
first, being both corruptions of the French Percepierre ; and 
one of them at least is not of very modern origin, for I find 
one of our authors complaining, more than 200 years ago, that 
" that barbarous word Parsley Piert was given by some 
simple man." It may be added, that I have been informed 
by an extensive practitioner of this County, that, under the 
use of this plant, he has known fetid urine speedily improved.

SPECIES. 

1. Ilex Aquifolium. Common Holly. 

Leaves ovate or elliptical, upon short stalks, leathery, shin- 
ing, wavy, cartilaginous at the edges, where they are divided 
into large projecting teeth, which, like the apex of the leaf, 
are spine-pointed. Many of the highest leaves are, however, 
nearly entire. Flowers numerous, whitish, in small bunches. 
Berries red. 

Woods and hedges ; but frequently not wild. Magnificent 
upon some parts of Deeside. 

A tree â€” flowering in May and June. 

Obs. â€” A handsome evergreen tree, a few feet high ; but some- 
times double its usual height, with hard, close-grained wood. In 
the north of Scotland, the berries are not in general produced in 
great abundance. It is mentioned by Sir. James Smith that the 
branches laden with berries are stuck about rustic kitchens and 
churches at Christmas, and remain till Candlemas-day ; and that in 
Norfolk the Misletoe accompanies them, and sometimes the Euony- 
mus. He adds, that the Druids are said to have introduced this 
custom for the accommodation of certain sylvan spirits of a chilly 
constitution, when other trees were leafless. 

The seeds of the Holly have been proposed as a substitute 
for coffee.

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” These three species are separated from the succeeding 
part of the genus by the floating upper leaves. No. 1. is charac- 
terized by the floating leaves being large and leathery, and those 
below few in number, narrow, imperfect, and scale-like; while in 
No. 2. the upper leaves are smaller and more delicate, and those 
below water far more numerous ; the spike being shorter and its 
stalk thicker. I do not, however, find that we can rely upon the 
accuracy of one of the marks of distinction, pointed out by an acute 
observer, viz. that the leaves are distantly inserted on the stem, 
in P. heterophylla. The last of the three (rufescensj is remark- 
able for becoming of a reddish hue, especially in the upper part. It 
is distinguished from the two others by the long leaves, which, 
below water, are scarcely less than the floating ones ; whereas, 
in Nos. 1. and 2. the upper leaves are greatly larger than those 
below.

4. Potamogeton prolong a. Long-stalked Pond-weed. 
Stem strong, a little tortuous. Leaves long and rather broad, 

slightly tapering towards the point, sessile or even slightly 
clasping; their ribs numerous, more or less distinct, running 
mostly from end to end, connected by transverse fibres. 
Flower- stalks strong and of great length. Nuts very nu- 
merous, like the leaves deep-green ; having when mature, 
a prominent sharp border, with faint furrows and ribs on each 
side of it.

Obs. â€” This section is characterized by the leaves being all under 
water, and mostly approaching to the lanceolate form. P. pralon- 
ga is one of the most recent additions to the British Flora. It is 
said, however, that there are specimens of it in the Herbarium of 
Mr. Brodie of Brodie, 20 or 30 years old ; and it is certain that the 
writer of these remarks, though then unable to determine the name, 
gathered this species in Cromar, Aberdeenshire, several years be- 
fore it was known to be a native of Britain, and showed the speci- 
men, still in his possession, upon the same day, as something re- 
markable, to his friend Mr. John Anderson, now editor of a Lon- 
don daily paper. The most remarkable features in this species 
(which seems allied to P. rufescens) are the oblong, blunt, slightly 
clasping leaves, with the long and strong flower-stalks. The nuts, 
too, are very large, and also in great number, being upwards of 
a hundred upon one of the spikes before me. P. lucens is marked 
by long, pointed, stalked, thin and shining leaves, usually all under 
water. The species has, however, been said to have occasion- 
ally floating leaves, and, indeed, it is, in all respects, a very 
variable plant. The leaves are of all lengths, from a few inches 
to nearly a foot, their stalks also differing very much, even upon 
the same specimen ; and while Hooker calls the flower-stalk about 
the same length as the spike, I find it in one specimen more than 
six times as long. The leaves, too, sometimes have a singu- 
lar thorn- like point. This species is perhaps best characterized 
by the very distinct net- work; and by the outer ribs running 
from end to end of the leaf, while the inner ones successively 
join the mid-rib, at some distance from the base. This last 
circumstance, however, though more strongly marked in this 
species than in any other, is by no means peculiar to it, as some 
have supposed ; for I have observed it in P. rufescens, and also 
in some specimens of the prcelonga. P. lanceolata is distinguish- 
ed by the leaves being rather small, lanceolate and sessile, with 
a beautiful network which is most distinct upon the upper ones, and 
in the vicinity of the mid-rib. This species makes an approach 
both to P, rufescens and heterophylla, and there might be consid- 
erable difficulty, especially between it and the latter, should the 
lanceolata sometimes have, as it is said, floating leaves, or were 
these accidentally wanting in P. heterophylla. The two plants may, 



TETBANDRIA.] POTAMOGETON. 109 

however, if I mistake not, be always distinguished by the leaves of 
the latter, even to the lowest, being- overspread with an evident net- 
work ; while this is well seen only on the upper leaves of P. lanceo- 
lata, which is, moreover, of greater delicacy, and remarkably 
branched. The two species last- described in this section, require no 
comment. It may, however, be observed that, though I have little 
doubt that P. crispa grows in Aberdeenshire, any allusion in proof 
of this, to mv own specimens, has been omitted, because they are 
in an imperfect state, and far from similar to the English Botany 
figure of this species. The margins are but slightly serrated and 
waved in my specimens ; whereas, in the figure referred to, there 
are large lobes and sinuses, as in the leaf of the oak ; so that this 
species â€” though one of its old names is Tribul us floribus quercus â€” 
would appear better suited to have its leaves, than its flowers, 
likened to those of the oak.

Obs. â€” This is a second division of the submersed Potamogetons, 
separated from the former, by having narrow, mostly parallel-sided 
leaves. The first of them (zostercefolia) has only been of late added 
to the British Flora, and is characterized by the comparatively large, 
grassy, or grass-wrack-like leaves, with numerous ribs, many of 
which, however, are far from distinct. With the undoubted P. gra- 
minea, I confess myself unacquainted ; and it maybe suspected that 
varieties of other species have frequently received this name. It is 
said to be characterized by grassy leaves, with the side rib single 
and scarcely perceptible, and the spikes upon stalks scarcely 
longer than themselves. The leaves are narrower in the two suc- 
ceeding species (Nos. 11. 12.) which maybe distinguished from one 
another as follows: â€” In P. pusilla, the leaves are very narrow, with 
a single indistinct lateral rib at each side of the central one ; 
and the flower-stalks are several times as long as the spike ; 
while in the compressa the leaves are broader, with a couple of 
faint lateral ribs, sometimes to be perceived on each side of the 
central one, and the flower-stalk is rather short, sustaining a 
comparatively stout and often interrupted spike. It is strange 



TETRANDRIA.] RUPPIA. SAGINA. 11] 

that more than one of our authorities in Scottish Botany, express 
themselves unacquainted with P. pusilla, although it is probably 
far from uncommon in many parts of the kingdom. Along with the 
specimens of P. pusilla above referred to, Mr. Arnott of Arlary â€” 
whose opinion, it is well known, is entitled to deep attention â€” has 
favoured me with remarks upon this species, from which I gather 
that he concurs with Chamisso and Schlechtendal, in uniting, 
without hesitation, P. pusilla and compressa. Physiological or 
anatomical difference (Mr. Arnott says) there is none ; but without 
having a positive conviction that they are strictly different species, it 
has been here thought best to keep them separate, since they are 
very unlike one another, and always to be distinguished by the marks 
already given ; to which it may be added, that P. compressa is of a 
paler or more brownish-green, retaining also its shape better than 
P. pusilla, with stipules far more distinct ; these being white, 
large, and somewhat inflated. P. pectinata is seldom met with, 
and is indicated by the two-rowed bristle-like leaves and interrupted 
spikes.

Annual â€” flowering from May to August. 

Obs. â€” The more erect form of the 2d species, with its fleshv, not 
bristle-pointed leaves, and the wanting corolla, will, in general, 
readily distinguish it from the 1st. The bristle-pointed leaf of S. 
procumbens is not, however, to be at all times relied on ; nor can we 
build much upon the absence of petals in S. maritima, as none of the 
members of this genus appear to be very uniform in respect of corol- 
la. For these considerations, there might be a difficulty between 
the above two species, when S. procumbens grows upon the coast, in 
which case it will probably put on a more fleshy condition. Hooker 
says that Sagina procumbens is sometimes with difficulty distin- 
guished from Spergula subulata, and it is somewhere stated that 
Linnaeus confounded these species; but I conceive that the compara- 
tively large corolla of the latter will sufficiently separate it from 
any of our Saginas, and it appears more likely that a dubiety should 
occur between Sagina procumbens and Spergula saginoides. In 
such a case of doubt, it may be recollected that the latter is com- 
paratively so rare, that the chances are many thousands to one, in 
favour of the plant being Sagina procumbens. It may be added, that 
another species of Sagina, called apetala (but said to have a co- 
rolla), may possibly occur in this quarter, though I have never seen 
it, as it is said to be not unfrequent in Scotland, and very common 
in England. It is characterized by the leaves being fringed, with a 
distinct bristle at the point.

Stem shoi't, soon branching. Flowers all blue. Calyx, 
when the plant is in fruit, open, and about the same length 
as its stalk. 

Very dry sandy places ; not frequent. â€” Abundant at Aber-

Coast of Buchan. Mr. Cow. â€” Ladyhill, Elgin ; Cromwell 3 
Mount, Campbelltown. Mr. Stables. 

Annual â€” flowering in April and May. 

Observations. â€” These two species differ from those which follow 
in the shortness of the flower- stalk, which never (not even when the 
plant is in fruit) exceeds the calyx in length. They are known from 
one another by the 2d sp. having the flowers all blue, and the calyx, 
in the last stage, more or less gaping ; while, in the 1st, the flowers 
are some yellow, others blue, and the calyx is shut upon the seeds. 
M. collina is a species comparatively new to the Botany of Britain, 
which, in the station above specified, had attracted the attention of 
the writer of these remarks, before its appearance in any British 
Flora, though he did not then discriminate it as a good species, 
but only considered it a singular, minute variety of M. arvensis, 
looking like a little Forget-me-not flower-spike nestling in the sand. 

3. Myosotis arvensis. Field Scorpion-grass. 

Myosotis scorpioides (var.). Linn. â€” Smith's Flora Bri-

late, tapering into a stalk at the lower part of the plant ; but 
above, sessile or even slightly clasping.* Clusters at first 
spirally twisted (as in the whole genus â€” whence its name, 
from a supposed resemblance to the curled tail of a scorpion) 
afterwards straight. Proper flower-stalks, at first nearly 
erect, but ultimately almost perpendicular to the common

teeth ; when in fruit, ovate, shut, and upon a stalk twice its 
own length 

Cultivated places, &c. common. 

Annual â€” flowering from June to August. 

4. Myosotis sylvatica. Wood Scorpion-grass. 
Myosotis scorpioides (var.). Smith's Flora Britannica. 

Leaves hairy. Clusters loose. Calyx with long, narrow 
teeth ; in the last stage ovate, closed, and on a stalk twice as 
long or more. Limb of the corolla flat, blue, its diameter 
longer than the whitish tube. 

Dry shady places. 

Perennial â€” flowering in midsummer. 

Obs. â€” These two species are distinguished from the preceding 
by the calyx, when the plant is in fruit, being upon a stalk about 
twice its own length ; and from the two that follow, by the dry 
stations and ultimately shut calyx. M. arvensis and sylvatica are, 
however, here given as different species, less from knowing them to 
be so, than out of a deference to the opinion of others. The most 
tangible distinction may be said to reside in the greater size of M. 
sylvatica, more especially its corolla, and in the looser inflorescence ; 
and, moreover, it is alleged that the latter is perennial, with the 
limb of the corolla flat, while the arvensis has an annual root and 
the limb concave. 

5. Myosotis palustris. Water Scorpion- grass. Forget-me- 

not. 
Myosotis scorpioides (var.). Linn. â€” Smith's Flora Bri- 
tannica. 

Stem rather smooth j its hairs rarely spreading, few 
and close, like those of the leaves and calyx. Corolla 
large, bright blue, pink in the bud. Calyx with short trian- 
gular teeth ; gaping when the plant is in fruit, and on a 
stalk several times as long as itself. Clusters leafless. 

Ditches and wet places rather frequent. Moor near llubis- 
law ; Alford ; Buchan, &c. &c. 

Perennial â€” flowering in the summer months. 

6. Myosotis secunda. Pale-flowered shaggy Myosotis. 
Stem clothed with long spreading hairs, which are 

stronger and more numerous than in M. arvensis ; some- 
times throwing out creepers. Leaves as is usual in the 
genus ; their hairs pressed close, like those upon the calyx 
and on the stalks both of the clusters and of the flowers.

1 lt> MYOSOT IS [PENTANDRIA. 

Calyx small ; when in fruit gaping (but less so than in M. 
palustris) ,. with, narrow lanceolate teeth; and upon a long 
stalk, which, at last, is perpendicular to the main stalk, or even 
with an inclination downwards, and then directed uniformly 
to one side, so as to present a marked unilateral appearance. 
Flowers large, many of them pale blue, some flesh-coloured, 
and not a few almost milk-white. Clusters, in the last 
stage, very long, weak, and horizontal ; one or more leaves 
being usually mixed with the lowest flowers. 

Spongy bogs and wet ditches ; not uncommon. â€” Occasionally 
around Aberdeen. Abundant and large in a marsh near Guise, 
Tough ; and in various other parts of the Alford district, often 
associated with M. palustris. Morven, Cromar. Also, in Buchan, 
at Methlick, Aberdour, &c. ; and in Sutherland. Indeed, it 
probably occurs over the whole north of Scotland. 

Perennial (?) â€” flowering in summer and autumn. 

Obs. â€” The present section is indicated by the wet places of growth 
in conjunction with the long fruit-stalks and gaping calyx. No. 5. 
is distinguished by the large bright-blue flowers, and short triangu- 
lar teeth of the calyx. As to the Myosotis last described, it will be 
seen that I have introduced a new species,* which has been named 
Myosotis secunda, because the flower- stalks have ultimately a very 
remarkable tendency to one side. It is, however, to be noticed, that 
all the species, particularly M. palustris, have, when old, an unila- 
teral tendency, though by no means in the same degi-ee as the species 
now alluded to ; which is, besides, more hairy than any of the others, 
and is, on the whole, so remarkable and distinct, that it cannot be 
supposed hitherto overlooked, but certainly it has never been suf- 
ficiently attended to. It has probably been considered a variety of 
some other Myosotis, as of palustris or ccespitosa ; but it is, doubt- 
less, well entitled to rank as a species, since its characters are more 
marked than those of any other member of the genus. Indeed, its 
port is so different from any of our other species, that I can invari- 
ably detect it, even when at too great a distance for perceiving the 
tint of the flowers or the hairiness of the stem. The following 
particulars (mainly a recapitulation) may be noticed : â€” 

The stem is remarkably hairy. The flowers are usually pale blue, 
though not seldom white; and larger tlian inM. palustris. The calyx 
is small and gaping (but not very wide) when the plant is in fruit, with 
teeth narrower and deeper than in M. palustris, and more resembling 
those of the arvensis. In an advanced stage, the clusters are very 
long and horizontal, with the flower-stalks more or less vertical, and 
all hanging to one side. A remarkable feature is, that the leaves â€” 
to the number of 1, 2, 3, 4, and even 6 or 8 ; indeed, sometimes, 

a It has, however, already been alluded to by rne, in a paper contained in the 
11th No. of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal.

though very rarely, reaching the extremity of the cluster â€” are 
mixed with the flowers ; and the hairs continue spreading up to the 
highest leaf, beyond which they are close. It remains to be added, 
that the fruit-stalks are more diverging and longer than in M. pa- 
lustris, and still more so, than in any other species of Myosotis ; and 
that the places of growth are wet and spongy. 

The flowers of this genus are singularly interesting; but 
the herbs, though said to be possessed of astringent proper- 
ties, are not in any way made use of. 

GENUS II. LITHOSPERMUM. 

Calyx inferior, of one leaf, deeply five- cleft. Corolla of 
one petal, funnel-shaped; tube cylindrical, as long as 
the calyx ; the limb divided, half-way down, into five 
obtuse segments ; orifice naked. Seeds four, hard, 
lying in the bottom of the calyx.

spread with minute granular bodies, ovate, imperfectly 
pointed ; below tapering into a stalk. Flowers mostly in 
clusters ; corolla of a beautiful purple. Seeds large, keeled, 
even. 

On the coast pretty frequent and abundant ; chiefly in stony 
places. â€” From specimens which I have gathered or seen, I can 
speak to its occasionally occurring, all the way from the Frith of 
Forth to John o' Groat's. Near Aberdeen, in the sand at Don- 
mouth, but in extremely small quantity ;* and at the Bay of Nigg. 
On the beach at Stonehaven and a little to the southward. 
Also, in various places to the north of Stonehaven, usually

ter, and by its large, shining, polished seeds.* In every stage, we 
can refer to the leaves, which in L. officinale are more greyish and 
more pointed than in the other, and, moreover, have distinct side- 
ribs ; while in the arvense there are merely mid-ribs, without any 
lateral ones. No one will mistake the singular and beautiful '3d 
sp., confined to the loose stones and sand of the seaside. In drying, 
it turns black, and in this state, according to my observation, the 
crystalline bodies, upon the leaves, not always very apparent in the 
fresh state, become the most evident. The recent leaves have a 
flavour somewhat resembling oysters. 

The seeds of L. officinale (and, indeed, various species of 
this genus, both British and Foreign) have been extolled in 
complaints of a calculous nature, with which opinion their 
stony hardness has, it may be suspected, had something to 
to do.f Waller believed this species possessed of narcotic 
properties, but modern writers seldom or never allude to 
it. It was long ago stated that the hard crustaceous part 
of these seeds effervesces with acids ; but far more reliance 
may be placed upon a recent account that they contain silica, 
phosphate of lime, and iron. The root of L. arvense has a 
red bark, " which communicates its colour to oily substances, 
as well as to paper, linen, and pale faces." 

GENUS III. ANCHUSA. 

Calyx inferior, five-cleft. Corolla funnel-shaped, with 
five obtuse lobes and a cylindrical straight tube ; the 
orifice covered by convex scales. Seeds four, concave 
at the base. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Anchusa sempervirens. Evergreen Alkanet. 

Root thick, mucilaginous. Stem erect, reaching to a foot 
and a half in height. Leaves ovate, acute, diminishing to- 
wards the summit; the lowest being of great size and upon 
stalks, while the upper are far smaller and sessile. Flower- 
stalks springing from the bosom of the leaves, and carrying 
the flowers in heads, each of which is accompanied by two 
small leaves. Corolla fine blue, not properly funnel-shaped, 
but with a short tube, resembling the flower of a Myosotis. 
Whole plant clothed with rigid hairs. 

* There is something very remarkable in the exquisite polish and stony hard- 
ness of these seeds. Pliny considered them one of the greatest curiosities in the ve- 
getable kingdom : " Nee quicquam inter herbas majore quidem miraculo aspexi."

120 CYNOGLOSSUM. [fentandria. 

Roadsides and the vicinity of old gardens ; not frequent, and 
never completely in a state of nature.â€” At Aberdeen, near the 
Rubislaw Distillery ; Deeside; Old-Aberdeen; and Hilton. Vale 
of Alford in one or two places. Near Stonehaven. Den of Auch- 
medden, and various parts of Buchan. And occasionally in most 
parts of the north.

not perforated at the base, more or less prickly, at- 
tached to a central column formed by the style. 

SPECIES. 

1. Cynoglossum officinale. Common Hound's Tongue. 

Stem from one to two feet high, branched, downy, chan- 
nelled. Leaves lanceolate, entire, soft, covered with whitish 
down 5 stalked below, sessile or clasping above. Calyx downy. 
Corolla reddish. Flowers in long, loose, unilateral spikes. 
Stamens shorter than the corolla. 

Rare. â€” Indeed, I have never gathered it in the north of Scot- 
land, though I have met with it unequivocally wild on the east 
coast, to the south of the range allotted to this publication.

Chrystall. â€” In a meadow, at the back of the House of Castle 
Fraser, Aberdeenshire. Dr. D. Skene. â€” Boyne Castle, Banff- 
shire. Mr. Cowie. â€” Auldearn churchyard, in Moray. Mr. 
Stables. â€” A common weed in the churchyard of Kilmuir, Easter- 
Ross. Mr. Chrystall. 

Biennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” Sir James Smith observes that the whole herb is of a dull 
green, downy and very soft, exhaling, when touched, a pungent and 
nauseous scent, like that of mipe, or, as some say, the urine of dogs. 
The leaves in this genus have been likened to a dog's tongue ; 
whence its name â€” from kvcov, a dog, and ykaxra-a, a tongue. 

The leaves of this herb are recommended in ill-conditioned 
ulcers ; and, in Ray's Synopsis, it is reported that the root is 
useful in glandular complaints, both as an inward and an out- 
ward application. " In strumis et scrophulis, Cynoglossoe 
radicem turn intus in decocto, turn extra in cataplasmatis 
forma, summo cum successu, adhiberi solitam audivimus.

PENTANDIUA.] SYMPHYTUM. BORAGO. 121 

GENUS V. SYMPHYTUM. 

Calyx inferior, five-cleft. Corolla of one petal, tubular, 
swelling out above, with five shallow, acute, marginal 
segments ; the orifice closed, with five lanceolate 
fringed scales. Seeds four, tumid. 

SPECIES. 

1. Symphytum tuberosum. Tuberous-rooted Comfrey. 

Root whitish. Stem scarcely winged. Leaves harsh, 
broad, lanceolate, tapering at the base, running slightly 
along the stem, the upper ones opposite. Flowers yellowish- 
white, drooping. Anthers large, mostly concealing the fila- 
ments, which are short and attached to the inside of the 
corolla about its middle. Style long. 

Banks of rivers, roadsides, and old gardens ; not uncommon. â€” 
At Aberdeen, near Powis' Burn, and on the Deeside road, &c. 
Near Manse of Alford, and in the upper part of the same valley, 
upon the Banks of Don. Various parts of Buchan ; and in the 
vicinity of Banff. Also, in Forfarshire. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” It appears not to be long since this species was first observed 
in Britain. It is, however, pretty common in the North ; but has, 
doubtless, usually spread from gardens, where, from its supposed 
virtues, it appears, at a former period, to have frequently had a 
place. It is, however, sometimes undoubtedly wild, as I have met 
with it in great abundance, in the upper part of Alford, remote from 
a garden, or indeed from any habitation. S. officinale, certainly not 
indigenous, though occasionally here met with, is characterized by 
the decurrent leaves, winged stem, and purplish flowers. This 
species is, however, reckoned a native of Angus, both by Mr. Don 
and Dr. M'Nab. 

S. tuberosum is called Conifer Knit-been in Aberdeen- 
shire ; where a preparation, made by boiling the root in 
oil or lard, is extolled, by old women, for hardening and 
strengthening fractures. S. officinale is astringent and mu- 
cilaginous, on which account it is still recommended on the 
Continent (as it formerly was in Britain) in diarrhoea, he- 
morrhage, and cough. The name of the genus (from (Tvix<pvo>, 
I unite) refers to its vulnerary qualities. 

GENUS VI. BORAGO. 

Calyx inferior, five-cleft. Corolla wheel-shaped, with 
five flat, widely spreading lobes, and, having at its ori- 
fice, five obtuse, awl- shaped, or notched scales. Seeds 
four, wrinkled or tuberculated.

below largest and tapering into a stalk. Flowers at the ex- 
tremity of the plant, and arranged in a sort of panicle, which 
is composed of drooping bunches. Corolla beautiful, com- 
monly blue, with prominent stamens. Calyx shaggv. 

In cultivated fields ; but not common, and scarcely a native. â€”

GENUS VII. LYCOPSIS. 

Calyx inferior, deeply five-cleft. Corolla funnel-shaped, 
with five obtuse, rounded lobes, and the tube twice 
curved ; its orifice closed, with five convex, hairy, con- 
verging scales. 

SPECIES. 

1. Lycopsis arvensis. Small Bugloss. 

Root whitish. Stem angled, juicy, not quite straight. 
Leaves light green, lanceolate, wavy, of variable breadth ; 
the lowest upon stalks ; the rest sessile or clasping ; all over- 
spread, like other parts of the plant, with prickles and 
roundish warty bodies. Clusters usually in pairs, leafy. 
Corolla blue, with a twisted tube. Calyx very bristly. 
Stalks of the flowers and fruit erect. 

Cultivated fields ; common. â€” Abundant between Craiglug 
and bridge of Dee, on the north side of the river, and in other 
places around Aberdeen. 

Annual â€” flowering in June. 

Obs. â€” The genera Lycopsis, Myosotis, and Anchusa, make a near 
approach to one another. Indeed, Anchusa sempervirens scarcely 
differs generically, from Myosotis ; but the twisted corolla of Lycop- 
sis, perhaps, sufficiently separates it from the two others.

protruded far beyond the corolla. Spikelets unilateral, 
hairy, curved ; ultimately becoming erect, and collectively 
composing an extensive spike or panicle. 

In cultivated fields, generally among wheat. â€” Occasionally in 
the vicinity of Aberdeen ; but uncommon in Aberdeenshire, and 
probably not wild. So rare in the Alford district that I have

osity. Found, though but sparingly, throughout the whole of 
the north.

Perennial â€” flowering in June and July. 

Obs. â€” The Primrose is one of our most common plants, decorat- 
ing, at an early season, many a sequestered bank and stream. Some 
one seems to apply it as a criterion of the observer's turn of mind : 

" A Primrose by the water brim, 
A yellow Primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more." 

It is characterized by every flower-stalk springing from the root 
and supporting a single large flower, with the rim of the corolla flat ; 
while the Cowslip is equally evident by each radical stalk carrying 
an umbel, which contains a number of yellowish concave flowers. 
Primula elatior may be called an intermediate form ; since it has the 
umbelliferous inflorescence of P. veris, whereas individual flowers 
resemble those of the vulgaris, in general aspect, as well as in the 
flat-rimmed corolla. From these three, P. Scotica is abundantly 
distinct, by its bluish flowers, and the powdery white substance upon 
its leaves, flower-stalks, and calyx. 

It has often been supposed that P. elatior is a hybrid engendered 
between the vulgaris and veris ; in confirmation of which opinion it 
may be observed that, on the coast of Buchan, where the elatior oc- 
casionally occurs, P. vulgaris is common, and veris by no means rare. 
It has also been supposed, by Linnseus and other authorities, that 
the two last-named forms are in reality the same species; but I 
cannot avoid thinking that this opinion stands in need of farther 
confirmation. Upon this point, Sir John Hill's words, as they re- 
late to his own experience, may be quoted : "I have had the 
Coivslip, Oxlip, and Primrose, brought into a garden, where they 
continue, year after year, the same, and their seeds produce the 
same distinct kinds and no other." â€” (British Herbal, p. 69.) There 
seems more reason for entertaining doubts regarding the essential 
difference between P. Scotica and P. farinosa, a species met with in 
the south of Britain, but not with us.f P. Scotica is the shorter 
and stouter of the two, and it appears Dr. Graham first observed 
that, in this species, the limb of the corolla is only half the length 
of the tube, while in P. farinosa these two parts are nearly equal. 
In P. Scotica, the teeth of the calyx have appeared to me shorter 



* A friend who was present, informs me that, at a late meeting of the Botani- 
cal Society of Edinburgh, Dr. Graham exhibited a Primula, picked in Norway 
by Mr. Edward Forbes, which corresponds completely with P. Scotica. 

-j- Information has, however, been received, that either P. farinosa or Scotica grows 
both upon the Buchan coast and in Glenfiddich. These are interesting and promis- 
ing localities; but my account is not direct, and I do not at piesent rely upon it.

and broader than in the farinosa ; but as my opportunities, for the 
comparison, have not been very complete, it might be worth deter- 
mining whether this observation is uniformly true. Perhaps, in- 
deed, throughout the genus, attention should be directed to the part 
alluded to. It will, at least, be found that the short broad triangular 
teeth of P. verts are remarkably different from the deep narrow ones 
of the vulgaris, while I have found them to be exactly intermediate 
in P. elatior â€” an observation, possibly worthy of notice, as tending 
to confirm the opinion that this is a hybrid production. 

It ought not to be forgotten that the species of Primula in gen- 
eral, have a tendency to produce â€” even occasionally upon the same 
root â€” both solitary and umbellate flowers ; a circumstance which may 
help to explain the contrariety of opinion, regarding the boundaries 
of species in this genus ; as it is possible that the form alluded to 
may have been sometimes taken for a proof of species supposed to 
be different, being, as it were, incorporated together, and therefore 
identical. 

Sir John Hill relates that the flowers of the Cowslip have 
a slightly narcotic quality ; and in France, at this day, the 
plant has a character in pulmonary complaints. It is not, 
however, probable that any Primula possesses much medi- 
cinal virtue.

is one of our finest natives, and is, indeed, excelled in beauty and 
elegance by but few foreign productions. 

Water Trefoil resembles the Gentians in botanical charac- 
ters, and in containing a bitter ingredient, which may be 
extracted by infusion. The tea thus procured may be pre- 
scribed by the regular practitioner in jaundice, or any other 
disorder, wherein a bitter laxative is likely to be useful ; and, 
with the addition of a little hartshorn or soda, the draught is 
well adapted to certain disorders of the stomach, particularly 
Water-brash, to which country-people are peculiarly liable. 
Half a drachm of the dried leaves in powder has been much 
extolled in Intermittent Fever, wherein it is said to have 
succeeded, after Peruvian Bark had failed. In France, the 
juice of the Trefle d'eau is recommended in intractable dis- 
eases of the skin. In Aberdeenshire, the leaves of Water Tre- 
foil are sometimes used in brewing ; and it has been said

Calyx inferior, deeply five-cleft. Corolla of one petal, 
wheel-shaped, with five deep segments, to which the 
filaments are opposite. Capsule of one cell, with ten 
pieces. Seeds numerous. 

SPECIES. 

1. Lysimachia Nemorum. Yellow Pimpernel. Wood 
Loosestrife. 

Stem creeping, varying from a few inches to a much 
greater length, slender, angular, reddish, pellucid. Leaves 
in pairs, upon short stalks, smooth, entire, ovate, acute. 
Flower-stalks axillary, somewhat twisted, and fully as long 
as the leaves ; each supporting a single flower with a golden- 
yellow corolla and smooth stamens. 

Banks of streams and moist shaded situations ; but not very 
common. â€” Near Aberdeen, at Ferryhill, Rubislaw, banks of Dee 
and Don, &c. In a small ravine, near the old bridge of Don ; 
in a small wood, near bridge of Dee, and upon the south side of 
the river, above Craiglug. Coast, between the Cove and Findon.

Ho*use and Brux, and in Angus, Kincardine, Banff, and Moray. 
Mr. Watson observed this species upon the Clova mountains. 

Perennial â€” flowering in summer and autumn. 
2. Lysimachia thyrsiflora. Tufted Loosestrife. 

Stems one to two feet high, round, erect, slightly woolly. 
Leaves numerous, opposite, sessile, smooth, lanceolate. 
Flowers small, yellow, in dense, stalked, ovate, opposite, 
axillary clusters, ahout the middle of the stem. Corolla 
dotted with red, with solitary minute teeth between the 
segments. Stamens smooth. Capsules rarely seen. 

Forfarshire, by* the lakes of Rescobie and Balgavies. Dr. 
Balfour. â€” Not uncommon in Angus. Mr. Geo. Don. 
Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” The smooth stamens of this genus, with the seed-vessel of 
ten pieces, may be sufficient to separate Lysimachia from Anagallis, 
which has hairy stamens, with the capsule opening all round about. 
It deserves notice that Merat says the capsule of Lysimachia is of 
five valves, and is disposed to consider L. Nemorum as having a 
capsule which is properly but two-valved. Sir J. Smith's words 
have been in a great measure adopted regarding L. thyrsiflora, a 
rare British plant. The term Lysimachia from Xvais and fiaxy 
is of similar import with the English name Loosestrife. 

GENUS XII. ANAGALLIS. 

Calyx deeply five-cleft. Corolla of five segments, which 
cohere at the bottom, in the wheel-shaped manner, 
without any tube. Stamens hairy. Capsule globular, 
bursting all round about. 

SPECIES. 

1 . Anagallis arvensis. Scarlet Pimpernel. 

Stem smooth like the whole plant ; prostrate or partially 
rising towards the summit. Leaves usually in pairs, stalk- 
less, ovate, with dark points beneath ; each having in its bo- 
som a flower-stalk much longer than itself, and curved down- 
wards in an advanced stage. Segments of the calyx nar- 
row, acute. Corolla scarlet ; its lobes slightly notched and

in flower; 24th June, 1 S36. Mr. G. Campbell Smith. â€” Pro- 
vince of Moray. Mr. Stables. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” These are interesting species, and are all of them among 
our plantoz rariores ,- though No. 3 appears to be not uncommon in 
the southern part of Britain. A. ccerulea, in particular, may be 
deemed scarce ; as it has never been observed growing by myself, 
nor communicated by any one, unless my cousin and pupil (" heu 
miserande puer"), whose name is mentioned above. It is, however, 
by no means agreed upon, that the plant alluded to is specifically dif- 
ferent from A. arvensis ; and it is far from often that either of these 
forms is a true native. It is, indeed, probable, that we seldom see in 
Scotland any wild Anagallis but the tenella ; which is indicated by the 
comparatively large corolla, and small size of the other parts, par- 
ticularly the leaves. It may be added, that the flower of A. arven- 
sis opens only in fine weather, and closes against rain â€” whence 
it is called the poor man's weather-glass, and it is said to be one 
of the most infallible that can be consulted. 



130 AZALEA. [PENTANDRIA. 

A. arvensis has a place in several foreign Pharmacopoeias. 
From the excellent work upon Medicine and Surgery, by 
MM. Roche and Sanson, it appears to be extolled in France 
â€” doubtless in vain â€” as a means of preventing hydrophobia. 
Orfila ranks it among the poisons which he calls " narcoti- 
co-acres," and its effects upon the animal economy, entitling 
it to a place in this class, are noticed in his Toxicologic Gene- 
rale, where it receives the name of Mouron des champs. M. 
Gronier found it to produce an abundant flow of urine in 
horses. From there being thus, now no doubt, that A. 
arvensis possesses active properties, the nearly forgotten vir- 
tues once attributed to it may deserve to be recalled. One 
of our English herbalists observes of it â€” " An infusion of 
the fresh plant is excellent in slight feverish indispositions, 
never, or very rarely, failing to promote perspiration and 
throw off the complaint. The whole plant dried and 
powdered is good against the epilepsy. There are well- 
authenticated accounts of this terrible disease absolutely 
cured by it. A decoction of it is much used, in some places, 
in the first stage of consumption."

inflexed margins of the bifid valves. Seeds attached 
to a central, at length free, receptacle. Named from 
dÂ£a\eo S , parched or arid ; because in such places the 
plant grows." â€” Hooker. 

SPECIES. 

1. Azalea procumbens. Trailing Azalea. 

Stem woody, rigid, tortuous, very much branched, bearing 
numerous, minute, smooth and glossy, oval leaves, which 
are rolled back at the margin, with very short but rather 
broad and sometimes fringed stalks. Flowers small, in ter- 
minating clusters ; each of their stalks having an ovate brac- 
tea at the base. Calyx purple, permanent, in five deep, 
narrow, fleshy segments. Corolla flesh-coloured, of five 
oblong segments. Stigma in the form of a roundish, lobed 
ring, bearing some similarity to the same part in the genus 
Pyrola. 

Alpine localities ; rather common. â€” Loch-na-gar, in Aber- 
deenshire. Fon-y-vean and Ben Hope, in Sutherland. 



PENTAXDHIA.j CONVOLVULUS. 131 

Abundant on the dry summits of mountains in the Braemar 
and Clova districts. On the top of Cairn Inks, a mountain op- 
posite to the Inn at Clova ; and on the summit of the mountains 
bounding Glen Fee and Glen Dole. On the Clova range we 
occasionally meet with a larger variety of the plant, resembling 
that brought from America. Dr. Balfour. â€” Cairngorum. Mr.

Shrub â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” This interesting and elegant little shrub with its stems 
usually buried in moss, clothed with numerous minute thyme-like 
leaves â€” which are marked above with a furrow, and beneath with a 
prominent broad nerve â€” is found on the higher parts of most of the 
northern mountains. " We are not certain," says Smith, " whether 
it was first observed by the Rev. Mr. Stuart of Luss, or any of Dr. 
Hope's travelling pupils." A. procumbens has not been found either 
in England or Ireland, but it abounds in the Arctic regions ; and it is 
not uncommon in Switzerland, as I have been informed by Mr. 
Thomson of Banchory, whose Swiss specimens appear to be larger 
than our common Scottish ones. Mr. H. C. Watson found this 
species 2850 feet high in Forfarshire ; and he says, on Ben-na-buird, 
it attains 3500, and on Ben Hope, 2600 feet. The same laborious 
and excellent observer informs me, that he has found it as low 
as 1460 feet, on Ben Heeal, Sutherland ; and that it probablv 
comes down as far as 700 yards in Aberdeenshire ; but it is 
the author's impression that he has gathered it considerably lower. 
In Switzerland, it is said to be scarcely seen below 6000 feet. 
It has not yet been detected either on the Strathdon hills ; or upon 
Morven, and other mountains at the head of Cromar ; nor am I aware 
that it ever comes lower down, upon Deeside, than Loch-na-gar. 
A. procumbens mav thus be considered an exclusively upland plant; 
and not one of those pliant species which the mountain flood is apt 
to snatch from their tempestuous highland homes, and carry away, 
in its swelling bosom, to a more peaceful lowland bed â€” wherein 
they seem to grow and prosper as well as in their own native stations. 

GENUS XIV. CONVOLVULUS.* 

Calyx inferior, in five divisions. Corolla bell-shaped, 
with five plaits. Stigmas two. Capsule invested 
with the calyx; its cells three or fewer ; each con- 
taining two large roundish seeds.

SPECIES. 

1 . Convolvulus arvensis. Small Bind-weed. 

Root creeping far, and difficult of extirpation. Stems 
numerous, twining or prostrate. Leaves upon stalks, arrow- 
shaped ; lobes at the base, acute ; and the summit with 
a minute bristle or point. Flower-stalks much longer than 
the leaves ; like the stem slightly downy, and bearing two 
minute bracteas about half-way between the flower and the 
stem. Flowers sometimes white, but often variegated. 
They are fragrant and close before rain. 

Fields and gardens ; not common. â€” Near Aberdeen, at Nigg,

Obs. â€” There is room for doubt about this being a true native. 
At least the writer has never seen it indubitably wild, in the tract to 
which these observations relate ; though he has gathered it, apparent- 
ly in a state of nature, not far from Dundee. C. Septum, distin- 
guished by its large size, and more particularly by the lobes at the 
base of the leaves being truncated ; with the bracteas heart-shaped, 
and close to the calyx which they enclose, has no claim to a place 
among our native productions. C. Soldanella, an undoubted native 
of the West, characterized by a prostrate stem, and fleshy kidney- 
shaped leaves, has never been detected upon the east coast. f

loose cluster, drooping, blue (though sometimes white), and 
upon long slender stalks, each of which has, at its base, an 
awl-shaped bractea. Corolla ultimately twisted. 

Common in dry places ; sometimes with white flowers, as in 
Alford and Lochell. Mr. Watson observed this species in the 
north of Caithness and Sutherland ; and at the height of 850 
yards in Clova and Braemar. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

2. Campanula latifolia. Giant Bell-flower. 

Stem round, unbranched, several feet high. Leaves 
roughish, doubly serrated ; below, ovate and upon rather 
long stalks, but becoming sessile and narrower towards the 
top ; those among the flowers being far the smallest. Each 
flower is upon a separate stalk, at first erect, but turning 
down when in fruit. Calyx smooth, the segments usually 
entire. Corolla large, blue or white. 

Moist shaded situations ; but rare. â€” Bank of Don, on the north 
side of the river, a little above Breda in Alford (with white 
flowers). 

In Angus. Mr. Don. â€” In the Den of the Vane, which the 
water Noran runs through. Anonymous. â€” Millowood, near 
Keith. (" With flowers nearly as large as a dram-glass.") Rev.

bution). 

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

3. Campanula rapunculoides. Creeping Bell-flower . 

" Leaves roughish, radical ones heart-shaped, crenate,

4. Campanula glomerata. Clustered Bell-flower . 

Stem slightly angled, never branched, downy or hoary 
like the leaves and calyx. Radical and lower stem-leaves 
either heart-shaped or ovate-lanceolate, stalked; the vipper 
leaves smaller and sessile, the very highest clasping the stem ; 
all of them slightly toothed. The flowers are without stalks, 
mostly in a cluster at the extremity, and accompanied by

occasionally they are scattered along the upper part of the 
stem in small heads and pairs, or even singly. Calyx small. 
Corolla large, of a fine blue. 

On the sea-coast ; but not frequent. â€” Upon rocks a little to 
the south of Montrose. 

Coast between Arbroath and Montrose, very abundant ; 
particularly near Auchraithie, where I picked it with white 
flowers, as had been done many years ago by Dr. P. Neill.

Near Stonehaven. Dr. D. Skene. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

Obs. â€” Nos. 1, 2, and 4 will be easily distinguished from one 
another, by the above notices. Having no good specimen, I copy 
from Smith the preceding description of C. rapunculoides â€” a species 
with flowers only half the size of the latifolia, and which may be said 
to be characterized by the heart-shaped leaves of the root, and the 
flowers directed to one side. This species has been admitted not 
entirely without hesitation ; while I have â€” possibly without an 
adequate reason â€” ventured upon refusing a place to C. patula, 
though already established in our ordinary Floras, as growing near 
Cullen. Moreover, it is the writer's impression that rarely, indeed, 
throughout Scotland, is any truly aboriginal Campanula to be seen, 
with the exception of C. rotundifolia, latifolia, and glomerata ; and 
it may be suspected that there are local English Floras, which would 
be improved by a considerable dismemberment in this genus.* 

Though the stately C. latifolia is not apt to be overlooked, I 
shall not contradict the statements of Sir \V. J. Hooker, that it is 
" very common in woody glens in Scotland," notwithstanding that 
it does not entirely coincide with my own opinion. The same emi- 
nent botanist has mentioned that the station of C. glomerata in 
Scotland is hilly pastures : but confined, he believes, to the east side, 
between the Frith of Forth and Montrose. It is certain that this is 
not an exclusively maritime species, either in England or upon the 
Continent; and though, by possibility, our hills may be its common 
habitat in Scotland ; yet, may it be permitted me to say that, when a 
very young botanist, I gathered it both in Fife and Angus, but have 
no recollection of C. glomerata, except upon rocks by the seaside. 
That this species, not long after the middle of last century, extend- 
ed to Stonehaven, appears from the following memorandum by Dr. 
D. Skene, which is interesting enough for insertion, chiefly because 
it shows, that more than one species formerly extended to a spot,

shape of the corolla.

within many miles of which, they do not now reach upon the same 
coast ; and thus may have a tendency to suggest that the northern 
limits of species are retiring in a southward direction : â€”

" The roots of several species of Bell-flower are said to 
increase milk in the breasts of nurses ; but that is an idle 
conceit," says a writer of the last century.* There was, no 
doubt, far more truth in the old opinion that the Throatworts, 
as they were called, are astringent ; and in particular, that a 
decoction of the root of C. latifolia, with the addition of a 
little red wine and honey, is useful in soreness of the throat 
and mouth, and in relaxations of the uvula.

high and flowering in midsummer ; but it may deserve mention, 

* These " conceits" seem occasionally founded on, what may be called, an ap- 
parent physical relation between the cure and the disease. Thus, Pulmonaria, 
because its leaves had spots like those upon the lungs, was thought useful in pul- 
monary complaints ; and Lithospermum was celebrated in Stone, on account of the 
6tony hardness of its seeds â€” shall I add, that Saxifraga granulala got its character 
as a lithontriptic from its root looking like so many little calculi ? In the same 
way, it may be believed that the Bell-flowers were supposed useful in deficiencies of 
the lacteal secretion, owing to the milky juice which the plants contain.

as it were, of a couple of pipes laid side by side, is abundant in the 
west Highlands, growing chiefly in the shallow edges of clear-bot-

cannot recollect to have seen it in Kincardineshire ; or any part of

138 VIOLA. [PENTANDRIA. 

Banks and cultivated fields ; common. â€” Abundant between 
Craiglug and bridge of Dee, at Aberdeen. Splendid, in a sunny 
day, near Leggerdale Inn ; but I have seldom seen, in the 
northern counties, the beautiful banks of V. tricolor which are 
so common in the south of Angus. 

Mostly annual â€” flowering through the summer. 

4. Viola lutea. Mountain Violet. 

Viola grandiflora. Lightfoot's Flora Scotica. 

Stem nearly erect, mostly unbranched. Leaves ovate, 
notched. Stipules cut into a fingered form, the middle 
segment largest. Bracteas minute ; at the upper part of the 
flower- stalk. Flowers large, usually yellow with black 
lines ; sometimes blue. 

Dry upland pastures. â€” Greystone, in Alford, but in small 
quantity ; much more abundant in Towie and Glenbucket. On 
Deeside, in the vicinity of Pananich; Glenmuick ; and all the way 
between Abergeldy and Castletown. 

Hill of Dunbarrow, Forfarshire. Dr. M'Nab. â€” Common (as 
well as the variety with purple flowers) on pastures at the upper 
part of Glen Clova, where Glen Dole and the Capel Munth 
separate. Also, found close to the sheiling at the foot of Can- 
lochan Glen, where it joins Caness Glen. Dr. Balfour. â€” 
Kirkton, Clova ; and in Aberdeenshire 550 yards high. Mr. 
Watson. â€” In Moray. Mr. Stables. â€” Both purple and yellow- 
flowered kinds together, at Ruthven, in Badenoch. Mr. Smith. 

Perennial â€” flowering in summer and autumn. 

Obs. â€” V. odorata (Sweet Violet) is probably never found with us 
wild, and is scarcely an unequivocal native of Scotland ; on which ac- 
count I have been not a little surprised to find Lightfoot and Hooker 
mentioning it, as if it were a common Scottish species, although, in 
his British Flora, the latter makes a different and more correct state- 
ment. Indeed, V. palustris is by no means a frequent species, and 
makes an approach to the canina ; but, not to mention that the for- 
mer is at all times a stemless plant, it cannot be called difficult to 
distinguish its broad, bluntish leaves, and small pale-blue flower, 
from the large purplish corolla and pointed leaves of V. canina. V. 
lutea comes rather near to the more common tricolor ; and, as has 
been elsewhere observed, distinct as these species probably are, it is 
very difficult to define the characters in words. The flower- stalks in 
V. lutea are longer ; and the corolla much larger, always greatly ex- 
ceeding the calyx. The mixture, too, of colours is less, all the petals 
being usually pale-yellow, though sometimes the whole are purple ; 
still more rarely, some are of the one colour, and the rest of the other ; 
while in V. tricolor (following Smith's words), " petals very variable 



VENTANDHIA. ] VERBASCUM HYOSCYAMUS. 139 

in size and colour ; the odd one broadest and yellow ; lateral ones 
bluish ; two upper ones (the flower being always reversed) pur- 
ple." V. lutea appears in a great measure confined to high in- 
land situations. The writer has never met with it, either in Buchan 
or the Mearns ; but he is not prepared to say that it may not occur 
in these tracts. Indeed, he has never gathered it upon Donside, 
below Alford ; nor does it become frequent before we reach Towie, 
where the corolla is mostly yellow; while, on the higher parts of 
Dee, the purple petals form a predominating feature. 

No violet but V. oclorata has a place in our own Materia 
Medica ; but various Continental Pharmacopoeias contain V. 
tricolor, on account of its alleged anodyne effects, and, in 
France, it is considered useful in diseases of the skin. Per- 
haps V. odorata is not the only species which might be 
used as a test of uncombined acids and alkalies.

Biennial â€” flowering in July and August. 

A liquor prepared by boiling the leaves of V. Thapsus in 
milk has been said to allay cough, and to take off the 
irritation from piles. Hooker mentions that the flowers, 
when dried in the sun, give out a fat matter, used in Alsace 
as a cataplasm in hemorrhoidal complaints.

Root spindle-shaped. Stem round, tough, woolly towards 
the top. Leaves sessile or clasping, lanceolate and pointed, 
sinuated, with sharp lobes. The flowers are without stalks, 
of a greyish-yellow colour, and much veined. Calyx with 
spinous teeth, the tubular part enlarging and enclosing the 
ovate seed-vessel. 

Rare, and mostly on the sea-coast. 

In the vicinity of Montrose. Anonymous. â€” St. Cyrus. Mr.

Banffshire, near old Castle of Findlater. Mr. Craigie and Dr. 
Geo. Wilson, Huntly. â€” Province of Moray. Mr. Stables. 
Annual â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” This species is remarkable for the strong oppressive odour 
which it exhales, and the singular appearance of the greyish, vein- 
ed corolla ; nor is it unworthy of notice that the capsules all turned 
to one side, are shut up within the calyx, and contain a number of 
small seeds, which find egress by the rounded convex top coming 
off, like the lid from a soap-box. At first, some doubt was enter- 
tained, whether H. niger was really indigenous in the North ; but 
from a recollection of myself gathering it in Fife, unequivocally 
wild, and from the information which I have received, it may be 
considered pretty certain that it is a true native of the coast of 
Angus and Mearns. The stations in Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray, 
are, however, liable to suspicion. 

From Hyoscyamus niger, medicinal preparations of no 
small importance are obtained. Opium, a similar agent 
which, when viewed in all its bearings, is, perhaps, the most 
valuable remedial substance, derived from any of the king- 
doms of nature â€” literally as it were embodying, in its 
varying effects, the mercurial qualities attributed to the 
messenger of the Gods ; 

" Dat somnos adimitque et lumina morte resignat" â€” 

is however liable to the objection that, while it usually tran- 
quillizes and lulls to sleep, it in no very few instances rather 
disturbs and produces irritation. The preparations of Hy- 
oscyamus, according to my experience, are the best sub- 
stitute for opium which we have ; possessing in no small

degree its useful qualities, without causing the bad effects, 
fairly attributed to that medicine. There can, however, 
be no doubt, that in large doses, Hyoscyamus is a decided 
poison. Dr. Christison, in his work on Poisons, (2d Edi- 
tion, 648) observes, " In a treatise on vegetable poisons, 
Mr. Wilmer has related the history of six persons in a 
family, who were poisoned by eating, at dinner, the roots of 
the Hyoscyamus by mistake instead of parsiieps. Several 
were delirious and danced about the room like maniacs, one 
appeared as if he had got drunk, and a woman became pro- 
foundly and irrecoverably comatose. Emetics could not be 
introduced into the stomach, stimulant clysters had no 
effect, external stimuli of every kind failed to rouse, and 
she expired next morning at six. The roots, in this instance, 
were gathered in the winter time â€” a fact which does not 
quite coincide with the conclusions to be drawn from Or- 
fila's experiments, that the plant must be in full vegetation, 
before its energy, as a poison, is considerable." 

GENUS XXI. ATROPA. 

Calyx inferior, of one leaf, with five segments. Co- 
rolla bell-shaped ; its lobes five, nearly equal. Sta- 
mens distant. Anthers heart-shaped. Berry glo- 
bulai', two-celled, placed in the enlarged permanent 
calyx. 

SPECIES. 

1. Atropa Belladonna. Divale. Deadly Nightshade. 

Root fleshy, creeping. Stem herbaceous, erect, two or 
three feet high. Leaves often in twos, ovate, pointed, en- 
tire, unequal, and upon short stalks. Flowers purple, soli- 
tary, drooping, stalked. Berry black and shining, sur- 
rounded by the calyx. 

Rare ; and scarcely indigenous.

Oes. â€” "Whole plant fetid when bruised, of a dark and lurid 
aspect, indicative of its deadly narcotic quality. * * Berry, the 
size of a small cherry, sweetish, and not nauseous, so that children 
have often been tempted to eat it to their own destruction." â€” Smith. 
The term Belladonna signifies a beautiful woman in the Italian lan- 
guage, and was given to this plant in consequence of the ladies 
using its berry in the composition of a paint for the face. 

Upon one occasion, as many as 150 soldiers were poisoned, 



142 ATROPA. [PENTAND11IA. 

near Dresden, with the berries of Belladonna ; and there 
can be no doubt that they are (like the root and juice of the 
leaves) a dangerous poison, though their activity seems very 
variable. At least, Sir. J. Smith observes that half one of the 
berries is said to have been fatal ; while, on the other hand, 
Dr. Christison alludes to an instance wherein a young man 
took a pound of them and yet recovered. The following 
unassisted case of poisoning by Belladonna, particularly as it 
came under the personal observation of Sir John Hill, may 
deserve to be inserted : â€” 

*' I saw one unhappy instance, in the year 1743. A labourer 
found it in the park of a nobleman, where he was repairing the 
pales, and he eat heartily of the berries, and gave some to his 
children. The symptoms came on in the following manner : â€” The 
man, after two hours, grew light-headed, giddy, and unable to 
stand ; but not thinking of the cause, sat down to his supper. He 
drank greedily, but could scarce swallow any thing solid. He went 
to bed, and presently grew worse. He complained of a dreadful 
pain in the breast and difficulty of breathing. It was about five in 
the afternoon he eat the berries. These symptoms came on between 
ten and eleven at night, and at twelve, seven hours from the eating 
of them, he fell into the most dreadful ravings. Once in a quarter 
of an hour, his senses would return for a moment ; but he relapsed 
immediately, and every time with more violence. During the inter- 
vals of reason his breath was as difficult, and he complained of a dread- 
ful tightness across his breast. Toward morning, the ravings went 
off, but he became foolish. He was faint, breathed with difficulty, and 
stared and slabbered, answered foreign to questions, and seemed 
one born an idiot. All this time he was affected with a most pain- 
ful and violent strangury ; but, by degrees, this went off, and he 
recovered without the help of medicines. Before the country apothe- 
cary could be had, he was growing better ; and he, not knowing what 
to advise, left the family to their own management. The children 
both died in the course of the night. * * * This I have seen." 
â€” British Herbal, 329. 

Upon the authority of Buchanan, several writers upon this 
plant notice, that a victory of Macbeth over the Danes was 
obtained chiefly by mixing it with a donation of wine and 
ale sent by the Scots to Sueno (or Swain), king of Norway, 
during a truce. They sent " both wine pressed out of the 
grape, and also strong drink made of barley-malt, mixed 
with the juice of a poisonous herb, abundance of which 
grows in Scotland, called Sleepy Night-shade." The descrip- 
tion of this plant may be given in the original words â€” 

" Caulis ei major bipedali, in ramos superne diffunditur, folia la- 
tiuscula acuminata exteriore parte, ac languide virentia ; acini pra>

Scoticarum Hist. Lib. VII. 

Atropa Belladonna furnishes an important medicinal pre- 
paration, one of whose most remarkable and useful effects 
is dilatation of the pupil. Perhaps one of the most protracted 
instances of this effect has occurred to the writer of these 
remarks, who was some years ago consulted by an individual 
in whom one eye was blind, while in the other, vision was 
so impaired that he only saw when under the effect of 
Belladonna, as light only then could reach the optic nerve. 
For the uncommon space of six or seven years this influence 
was in a great measure continued ; though latterly, I un- 
derstand, the indulgence was mainly reserved for fairs and 
feasts and other remarkable occasions. An English opium- 
eater, I recollect, speaks of carrying happiness in his waist- 
coat pocket ; and, in the same way, the individual referred 
to might, well, consider vision in the light of a portable com- 
modity. 

GENUS XXII. SOLANUM. 

Calyx inferior, in five segments. Corolla wheel-shaped ; 
the limb turned back, in five deep segments. Anthers 
opening at the summit, by means of two pores. Berry

SPECIES. 

1. Solarium Dulcamara. Bitter-sweet. Woody Nightshade. 

Stem twining, weak, though of a woody texture. The 
leaves are entire, but differ in form, some being heart- 
shaped, particularly at the lower part of the stem ; others, 
especially towards the summit, with lobes at the base, 
after the manner of a halberd. Flowers purple, in clusters, 
"with two round, green spots at the base of each segment." 
Anthers large, yellow. Berries oval ; when ripe, rather 
large and of a fine red colour. 

Not common. â€” At Aberdeen, in one or two places, adjacent 
to the west end of North Street ; and at Buxburn, a few miles 
off. In Angus, at Arbroath.

Obs. â€” Few plants have been introduced into these pages with so 
little title to be reckoned among our natives as the present, which, 



144 ERYTHR.EA. [fentandiua. 

indeed, has no appearance of being really indigenous even as far south 
as the Lothians ; beyond which I have not had an opportunity of ob- 
serving it. The common Potato belongs to the present genus, and 
Solanum nigrum is another species (characterized by a herbaceous 
stem and ovate leaves), which, however, is not known to me as 
occurring in the North ; and, indeed, it may be suspected that the 
statement, by both Lightfoot and Hooker, of its being frequent in 
Scotland, would deserve to be revised. 

Bittersweet was once reckoned a powerful medicine, as well 
as an active poison ; but Dr. Christison, on the authority of 
M. Dunal, observes, if it have any power at all, it must pos- 
sess too little to be entitled to the name of a poison. These 
berries, however, are still called "poisonous" and "very 
poisonous" in our most recent works on botany. Upon 
this subject, the following words (from Hill's British Herbal, 
328) comprise all that need be said : â€” 

" Upon the whole, this genus has a much worse character than 
it deserves. Nightshade (Solanum), in general, is accounted poi- 
sonous ; but, as we have shown, with respect to most of the species, 
there is little reason for such a character. This opinion seems to 
have arisen from confounding the plant next to be described (Bel- 
ladonna) under the same name. That is, indeed, poisonous, and 
having, by a latitude of speech, been called Nightshade, all the rest 
have been supposed of the same qualities."

Annual â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” It may be perceived that the writer has never gathered 
the present species in the north-east of Scotland, and he was not 
easy to convince that it has been met with in the vicinity of Aber- 
deen ; nor was he altogether satisfied of this, until Mr. Chrystall had 
the kindness to transmit to him a specimen found at Nigg. He has, 
however, found this species, or one nearly allied to it, though differing 
much in size, in Fife, Lancashire, and Belgium ; yet he does not con- 
sider himself well enough acquainted with the genus, for forming an 
opinion upon the question, whether or not the British plants be- 
longing to it, are in reality but varieties of one species. 

Centaury was once celebrated in complaints of the sto- 
mach, and it is said to be still prized by rustic practitioners 
in England. A modern French writer observes, " La petite 
centauree est le meilleur apres la gentiane de nos febrifuges 
indigenes ; cest un amer tres bon dans les fievres intermit- 
tent es simples, et un bon stomachique." 

GENUS XXIV. SAMOLUS.

Stem erect, about a foot high. Leaves oval, entire, glabrous, 
blunt, alternate ; the upper ones nearly sessile, those below 
tapering into a stalk. Flowers white, in long loose clusters ; 
each of the stalks having a little scale, at an abrupt bending 
near its middle. Capsule globular, embraced by the calyx. 
Seeds numerous, blackish, and angular. 

In Moray ; at the side of a ditch, between Kinneddar and 
Gordonstown. Mr. Stables. 

Perennial â€” flowering in July. 

Obs. â€” This species is said to be found in many parts of Britain,

no doubt that it is a very rare production in the north-east of Scot-

Mr. Stables.

Stem round and twining. Leaves ovate (in my specimens 
slightly downy, like the stem) and upon short stalks, but 
those of the summit sometimes almost meeting. Flowers 
fragrant, yellowish-red, gaping, collected into an ovate head, 
which terminates the stem. Calyx five-toothed. Tube 
of the corolla long. Berry dark red and globular. 

Occasionally upon small rocks, particularly in the neighbour- 
hood of streams. Near Aberdeen ; as at Bridge of Don ; upon 
the south side of Dee ; and in the vicinity of the Suspension 
Bridge. Among the large stones not far from the Cluny Toll ; 
and upon Donside, in Alford. Also, in Buchan ; Banffshire ; 
Moray ; and probably in many parts of the North.

1. Ribes petrceum. Rock Currant. 

Stem erect. Leaves more or less five-lobed, considerably 

downy beneath, and upon stalks of varying length. Flowers 

very slightly concave ; in clusters, which are slightly downy, 

and at first erect, but in fruit they become pendulous. 

Bracteas short. "Berries globose, bright red, acid."

Obs. â€” The writer has never met with an undoubtedly wild Ribes 
in any part of Scotland, nor has he accounts, upon which he places 
reliance, of any but the Rock Currant being indigenous in the 
North. Whether the other species, inserted in our ordinary books, 
have a good title to be reckoned natives of more southern parts 
of the kingdom, he has no means of judging.

SPECIES. 

1. Hedera Helix. Common Ivy. 

Stem either trailing and barren, or climbing and bearing- 
flowers. Leaves with three to five angular lobes, leathery, 
shining, stalked ; those upon the flowering branches ovate 
and entire. Flowers in a simple umbel. Berries blackish. 

Upon rocks, ruins, and trunks of trees; not uncommon. â€” 
Near Aberdeen, in various places; as banks of Don, near the 
Old Bridge ; rocks near Craiglug, upon the south side of the 
river ; Rubislaw ; Corbie Pot, &c. Also, upon the Kincardine 
coast, between Stonehaven and Portlethen. Rocks in the up- 
per part of Strathdon. Likewise, in Buchan ; Banffshire; 
Moray ; Ross (where it seems more than usually common) ; and 
Sutherland. 

A shrub â€” flowering in the end of autumn. 

Obs. â€” This species, when in the climbing form, attaches itself 
by means of dense tufts of whitish fibres. Formerly the Creeping Ivy, 
without flowers and all the leaves lobed, was reckoned a different 
plant from the Climbing Berried Ivy, with its upper leaves undivid- 
ed; and I understand that our own country people â€” probably with 
a similar view â€” sometimes speak of Creeping Ivy and Seeding Ivy. 

Hooker observes that an ointment made of the leaves of 
Hedera Helix is much valued, by the Highlanders, as a cure 
for burns, and the author of " Nouvelle Flore des Environs de 
Paris," observes, under this species, " Les feuilles de lierre 
s'appliquent sur les cauteres pour y maintenir lafraicheur, et 
en entretenir la suppuration. Les baies sont purgatives et 
vomitives" But, indeed, the most of all this may be found 
in " Old Gerarde," who, in his turn, probably derived it, 
directly or indirectly, from the ancients: " The leaves of Ivy 
are a remedy against burnings or scaldings. * * * 
They are laid upon little ulcers, made in the thighs, legs, 
or other parts of the body, which are called issues ; for they 
draw humours to those parts."

3. Gentiana nivalis. Alpine Gentian. 

Plant smooth, from one to four inches high or more ; 
with a single flower upon each of the few branches. Leaves 
small and oval. Calyx with five teeth, and as many brownish 
angles. Corolla funnel-shaped, bright blue; five-cleft with 
small notched segments between the larger ones. 

Mountains of Angus ; rare. 

At the top of Canlochan Glen, head of Glen Isla, upon rocks 
well marked by the white veins of quartz which intersect them 
in different places, and having at their summit a patch of snow 
that generally remains during the whole year. In this situation, 
the plant is associated with Erigeron alpinus and Carex atrata. 
I have also gathered it upon the north side of Canlochan Glen, 
along with Veronica saxatilis and alpina. Dr. J. H. Balfour. 



Obs. â€” The 1st and 2d species, though not a little similar, are 
sufficiently separated by the very unequal segments of the calyx in 
the former, wherein, too, the flowers are rather larger. G. cam- 
pestris seems to be one of those species which are common enough 
on the coast, as well as in upland situations, but far less frequent in 
the intermediate region. In Anderson's Guide, G. Amarella is men- 
tioned among plants found on the east coast of Scotland, almost 
exclusively ; but it is certainly not uncommon in some places in 
the west and north of Sutherland, while, so far as my own observation 
goes, it is altogether wanting on the far greater part of the east coast.* 

* I observe in the same list Primula veris, and Arenaria verna ; both of which 
are rather abundant in Aberdeenshire, more than 50 miles from the cast coast. 



150 CUSCUTA. [PENTANDRIA. 

The limited and exclusively alpine stations of G. nivalis, render any- 
additional account of its characters little necessary. This species, ac- 
cording to Dr. Graham, varies from a simple stem scarcely a quar- 
ter of an inch high, to one greatly branched and six inches in height ; 
but always with flowers of equal beauty and not differing propor- 
tionally in size. " The sparkling of this most rare and lovely gem 
(says the same Professor, in Jamiesons Journal, October, 1832), 
among the scanty mountain herbage, cured me of hunger and thirst, 
and made me forget that I was gathering it at the risk of my neck." 
Gerarde also, in his own way, expresses his admiration of an allied 
species of Gentian, whose flower he says, " seems to exceed blewness 
itself." It may be added that, on the mountains of Switzerland, as 
I understand from an accomplished friend, G. nivalis is a delightful 
sight. 

Annual â€” flowering in August. 

It is probable that a pure bitter Tincture or Dram might 
be conveniently got from steeping G. campestris in spirits ; 
and, by pouring boiling water upon the plant, a safer draught 
would, doubtless, be procured, which might be an advantage- 
ous substitute for certain stomachics, at present used by our 
country people. ,

CERTAIN INDIGENOUS SPECIES. 



By FRANCIS ADAMS, Esq. 

Translator of the Works of Paulus ./Egineta, &c. &c. 



The following brief notices from the Works of the Ancients regard- 
ing those plants in the Northern Flora, which held a place in their 
Herbals, it is to be feared, will not be looked npon as being a very 
flattering specimen of the knowledge possessed by the Greeks, Romans, 
and Arabians, on the subject of the Materia Medica. It must be 
attended to, however, that as few of the medicinal plants which 
grow in the classic regions of Europe and in Asia are indi- 
genous in Scotland, we have had no opportunity of giving their 
descriptions of the properties of those articles which the ancient 
physicians held in most esteem. We may mention, as a proof 
how very industrious the Rhizotomi and Medical Botanists of anti- 
quity were, in investigating the sanative powers of the vegetable 
kingdom, that, in the Materia Medica of Dioscorides, who flourished 
towards the end of the first century of the Christian era, about 700 
plants alone are described. To this list, the Arabians added a few 
articles of considerable importance ; but, upon the whole, the science 
of the Materia Medica continued in nearly the same state as it was 
left by Dioscorides, until it was enriched by means of the geo- 
graphical and scientific discoveries of late years. The old English 
Herbals and Pharmaceutical works of our forefathers are, almost 
entirely, made up from the writings of Dioscorides and Avicenna. 

F. A. 



Hippuris vulgaris. It would appear to be the tnvov of Theophrastus 
(H. P. iv. 11). The two species of innovpis, described by Dioscorides and 
the other medical authorities, are evidently to be referred to the genus Equi- 
setum, probably to the Jluviatile and the limosum. 

Fraxinus excelsior. According to Sprengel, it is the fieika of Homer. 
Dioscorides recommends the Fraxinus for the cure of the viper's bite, in a 
cataplasm, and also for leprosy. The old English Herbalist, Culpepper, 
gives a similar account of its virtues. 

Veronica Ana gallis. It would appear that it is the alov of Dioscorides, 
who makes it to be lithontriptic and diuretic. There can be no doubt that, 
as it is a vegetable aromatic, it is, to a certain degree, diuretic. 



11 APPENDIX. 

Lennia minor. The commentators on Dioscorides make it to be his 
Marsh Lentil (M. M. iv. 87). He says, it is possessed of refrigerant powers, 
and recommends it externally for the cure of inflammations, erysipelas, and 
gout. 

CladiumMariscus. Sprengel agrees with Cordus in referring the 6X6a-^oii/os 
of Dioscorides to this plant (M. M. iv. 25). It was held to be astringent and 
diuretic. 

Valeriana officinalis. It can scarcely admit of a doubt that it is the pov 
of Dioscorides and the other medical writers of antiquity. All the ancient 
authorities praise it for its diuretic and emmenagogue properties. 

Iris Pseudacorus. It is generally acknowledged to be the aicopos of Dios- 
corides, who calls it calefacient, and recommends it in strangury and other 
complaints. 

Scirpus palustris and lacustris. Some of the species of axoivos described 
by Dioscorides are most probably to be referred to these. (See Sprengel ad 
Dioscor. iv. 52.) 

Arundo Calamagrostis vel Calamagrostis epigejos, Roth. It is the KaXa- 
p.dypa>o-Tis of the ancient medical authorities. 

Arundo phragm it es. It is the (ppaypirvs of the ancient writers on medi- 
cine. Dioscorides recommends these reeds principally in external ap- 
plications, as refrigerants and paregorics. 

Triticum repens. It is decidedly the aypcoans of Theophrastus and Dios- 
corides. 

Lolium perenne. Without doubt it is the <pdiviÂ£ of Dioscorides (iv. 43), 
who recommends it as an astringent in diarrhoea and internal hemorrhage. 

Lolium temulentum. Theophrastus describes it by the name aipa (El. P. 
ii. 5, 8). 

Galium verum. This would seem to be the yaXiov of Dioscorides ; although 
it is not partial to marshy situations as he represents. He mentions that it 
was used for coagulating milk, in place of rennet. He further recommends 
it in a cataplasm for burns, and to stop hemorrhages (M. M. iv. 94). 

Galium aparine. It is the Aparine of the Greek medical authors, and the 
Lappa of Virgil. Dioscorides recommends it, in wine, for the bites of vipers, 
and of the venomous spiders called phalangia. 

Plantago major and lanceolata. These two species are described pretty 
accurately in the Herbal of Macer Floridas, and it appears to be certain that 
they are the two species of apvayXcouo-os described by Dioscorides. The 
Plantain has, in all ages, been celebrated as a vulnerary. 

Plantago coronopus. It is the Kopmvoirovs of Dioscorides and the ancient 
medical authors. 

Parietaria officinalis. Without doubt it is the Â£kÂ£Ln of the Greek medical 
authors, who recommend it as an external application for the cure of erysi- 
pelas and other inflammatory complaints. 

Alchemilla arvensis. It is the same as the Alchemilla apfianes, first de- 
scribed accurately by Lobelius. It has the French name of Percepier, and 
hence, perhaps, the English name Parsley piert. It is further called Parsley 
break-stone, and hence also, by a strange corruption, it is named Parsley 
brixton, by a writer in Mr. Guthrie's late publication on the diseases of the 



NOTES FROM THE ANCIENTS. Ill 

bladder. The renowned Nicholas Culpepper declares of it, that " its opera- 
tion is very prevalent to provoke urine, and to break the stone." And " a 
modern, mightier far," Mr. Watt of Old Deer, has assured the writer of this, 
that he has often proved the virtues of the Parsley piert in stranguries and 
other affections of the bladder ; and, in particular, that he has known the infu- 
sion act like a charm in excessively fetid urine. 

Potamogeton nutans. This, in all probability, is the first species of the 
two described by Dioscorides (M. M. iv. 98), who recommends it, as a re- 
frigerant and styptic, in prurigo and in old spreading ulcers. 

By the way, modern Botanists have fallen into strange mistakes about the 
gender of this word. Thus Sprengel, in his History of Botany, makes it 
masculine, and Hooker, in his Flora Scotica, makes it neuter. Now, it so 
happens that the word is unquestionably feminine in Latin, as is proved from 
the following passage in the N. H. of Pliny ; " Potamogeton adversatur et 
crocodilis : itaque secum habent earn qui venantur. Castor hanc aliter nove- 
rat," &câ€” (Lib. xxvi. c. 33. ed Hardouin.)* 

Myosotis palustris. This is clearly the second of the two species noticed 
by Dioscorides (M. M. ii. 214), who gives a pretty correct description of it, 
comparing its flower to that of the Anagallis cccrulea* He merely states of 
its medicinal properties that it cures fistula lachrymulis. 

Lithospermum officinale. It is briefly noticed in the M. M. of Dioscori- 
des, who recommends it as possessing lithontriptic and diuretic properties. 
Pliny, in describing this plant, bursts into raptures of admiration at the 
splendour of the leaves and the wonderful phenomenon of seeds of a stony 
hardness being produced in a vegetable. â€” (H. N. xxvii. 74). 

Anckusa sempervirens. We notice this merely to say that it is not any of 
the three species of K'yxpvsa described by Dioscorides, and the other ancient 
writers on the M. M. The Alkanet, so famous in ancient as in modern times 
as a dye, is the A. tinctoria. 

Cynoglossum officinale. This plant occurs in the M. M. of Dioscorides 
(iv. 127), who recommends it externally, mixed with old hog's lard, for the 
bites of dogs, alopecia (porrigo deculvuns), and burns ; and internally with 
wine, as a laxative. The English Herbalist, Culpepper, assures us that it not 
only possesses all the virtues ascribed to it by Dioscorides, but further, that 
" he cured the biting of a mad dog with this only medicine." With respect 
to the etymology of the word, he says " it is called Hound's Tongue, because 
it ties the tongues of hounds; whether true or not I never tried." 

Symphytum officinale. There can be no doubt that it is the second spe- 
cies of o-vfifyvTov noticed by Dioscorides (M. M. iv. 10). â€” All the Greek and 
Arabian authorities concur in recommending it internally for the cure of 
haemoptysis, and externally as an application to recent wounds. In like 
manner, Dr. Hill calls it a famous vulnerary, both internally and externally. 
Culpepper, as usual with him, follows the authority of Dioscorides. 

Echium vulgare. It has been generally acknowledged as the cx iov Â°f Ol- 
eander and Dioscorides, but, according to Sprengel, this is a mistake, since the 
flowers of the Eck. vulg. are blue, whereas Dioscorides describes those of 
the e. as being purple. It is to be remarked, however, that the Greeks used 
the terms nopepvpeos and 7ropcpvpoetdr]s in a loose manner to other colours be- 

* It will be perceived, under this genus, that the author has adopted Mr. Adams's 
opinion. In fact, general principles, as well as the authority of Pliny, may be said 
to be in favour of Potamogeton being a feminine word. â€” A. M.

sides purple, and more especially to the dark-blue colour of the sea, which 
would not be inapplicable to the colour of the flowers of the Viper-bugloss. 
It was given for the cure of venomous animals. 

Menyanthes trifoliata. This is briefly noticed by Theophrastus under the 
name of fj.rjva.v6os (H. P. iv. 11), and in the Geoponics, by that of rpupvWos. 
Dodonaeus advanced the opinion that this plant is the lo-onvpos of Dioscorides 
(M.M.iv. 119), but, asSprengel remarks, its botanical characters do not well 
agree with those of the Isopyrum as given by Dioscorides. At the same time, 
it must be observed that Dr. Hill speaks of the Buckbean as being serviceable 
in the same class of diseases for which Dioscorides recommends the Isopy- 
rum, namely, affections of the chest; and, I may add, from my own know- 
ledge, that the Rural Empirics in the North of Scotland still give it in Phthi- 
sical complaints. 

Anagallis arvensis and A. carulea. These two species are accurately de- 
scribed by Dioscorides, Galen, and most of the ancient writers on the M. M. 
The Scarlet Pimpernel has been celebrated, both in ancient and in modern 
times, as an application to the bite of the viper, and a few years ago it was 
much cried up in Germany by Bruck for the cure of Hydrophobia. Paulus 
iEgineta is most probably correct in stating that it is possessed of slightly 
heating and attractive powers. I do not find that any of the ancient authori- 
ties speak of it as being beneficial in the cure of hysterical and convulsive 
complaints, for which Dr. Hill says it has been greatly commended. The 
Pimpernel has been celebrated in prognostications of the weather â€” " Closed 
is the pink-eyed pimpernel." 

Viola odorata. This, without doubt, is the lov of Dioscorides and of the 
Greek poets. It was used principally in external applications as a refri- 
gerant. 

Verbascum Thapsus. According to Fuchsius and Sprengel, this is unques- 
tionably " the white Female Phlomus" of Dioscorides (M. M. iv. 122). The 
ancient authorities commend its root both internally and externally, as an as- 
tringent. Dioscorides says that when given in wine it cures Diarrhoeas. 

Erythrtea Centaurium. There is every reason to believe this to be the 
Lesser Centaury of the ancient physicians, who reposed great confidence in 
it â€” more especially Galen, who wrote a treatise on its medicinal powers. It 
was greatly famed for the cure of Hydrophobia. Serapion and Mesue com- 
mend it in the form of a potion; and in clysters for the cure of Sciatica. 

Lonicera Periclymenum. This is the second species of Cyclamen describ- 
ed by Dioscorides (M. M. ii. 194), who recommends it particularly as a diu- 
retic and laxative, in enlargements of the Spleen. 

Hedera Helix. The three varieties of the Ivy described by Dioscorides 
and other ancient authors are all referable to this species. Its juices are acrid 
and astringent, and hence it was recommended for the cure of Diarrhoea, and 
other internal complaints. But it was more particularly celebrated in exter- 
nal applications for the cure of burns and ill-conditioned ulcers. 



2.â€” OBSERVATIONS 

ON 

THE AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES 

OP 

NATIVE PLANTS. 



Rev. J. FARQUHARSON, F.R.S. 



Dr. Murray, before the announcement of his intention to publish a Flora 
of the northern part of Scotland, having applied to me to furnish him with 
the result of the observations I have made of the use of native plants espe- 
cially the grasses, in relation to agriculture ; I feel that I have been laid under 
too deep obligations to him for fidelity in his professional capacity, as a 
medical practitioner at one time resident in my parish, not to comply with 
his request. What follows does not, however, pretend to form any systematic 
or complete treatise upon the grasses, but only to present the result of the 
desultory and incidental observations I have made on some of the species 
which are common in this part of Scotland, and which I have observed to 
form the staple of our most valuable old pastures; and, in respect of a few 
species only, to give the result of actual experiment in their cultivation. 

The grasses form a great natural order of plants, more or less abundantly 
dispersed over almost all the lands of the globe. "They yield," says Sir 
James E. Smith, " more sustenance to man and to the larger animals than 
all the rest of the vegetable kingdom together." The natural order includes 
not only the plants which chiefly form our pastures and hay crops, to which, 
provincially, we limit the name grass ; but, in the arrangement of botanists, 
it comprehends also the plants which form the grain crops, as our oats, 
barley, rye, and wheat. In respect of these last, however, it is not proposed 
to enter into any detail. It is to the grasses, which are cultivated for hay 
and pasture for cattle, that our notices are chiefly to be directed. This branch 
of husbandry is of more recent introduction than that of grain; and there 
are yet many imperfections and deficiencies in conducting it, which a proper 
attention to the habits and qualities of our native grasses, and the judicious 
employment of some of them in cultivation, may do much to correct and 
supply. 

According to the most prevalent practice in this district, only three plants 
are cultivated for hay and pasture, viz. â€” the Lolium perenne or Ray-grass, 
the Trifolium pratense or Red Clover, and the Trifolium repens or White 
Clover. These are generally sown alike on all kinds of soil ; and as well 
on land that is intended to remain many years in grass, as on that which, in 
the practice of the common alternate husbandry, is to be only three years 
in that state. It is very true that, for the three years common in the alternate 
husbandry of this district, no plants better adapted for hay the first year and 
pasture the two next, could be chosen for the richer and drier lands than these 
three in use; and the excellent success which attends their cultivation, on 
rich dry lands which continue only three years in grass, is unquestionably 
one great reason why they are trusted to, as being all that are necessary on 
other soils; and also for perennial pasture. But the Red Clover is only a 
biennial, and of course fails in the two pasture years. The Ray-grass is the 



VI APPENDIX. 

native of a dry soil. It does not live in damp land generally longer than for 
the first year, which is devoted to hay; so that, of the three plants sown, only 
one, the White Clover, remains for the pasture years in the damp land. On 
such land, we accordingly observe the pasture (however rich the soil and 
productive of heavy crops of oats, and even of barley) very inferior. Two 
of the plants sown having died out, the surface is left extensively unoccupied 
by those of useful produce, and is taken possession of by hurtful weeds 
which the cultivator finds to be very troublesome afterwards. The Cnicus 
arvensis or Field Thistle, the Prunella vulgaris, and many other useless and 
injurious plants â€” among which the Holcus mollis or Creeping Soft Grass, a 
couch or remack the most difficult of extirpation, is often one â€” are seen taking 
possession of the vacant surface, and the farmer not only loses the crop of 
the year, but incurs great additional labour and expense in afterwards clean- 
ing his land. The Ray-grass fails, also, often in the second, and almost in- 
variably in the third year, even on the dry lands, if they are of a poor soil ; 
as the old outfields of the district, or thin sandy soils recently brought into 
cultivation. These are then generally immediately occupied by the Agrostis 
vulgaris, a late grass, disliked by cattle, and having a creeping scourging root, 
which is also difficult of extirpation. This is the plant that, generally getting 
into the pastures of such soils, gives them their frequently grey desolate aspect. 
The injury it occasions is so great, that it is a common proverb in this dis- 
trict, that " if poor or recently reclaimed land be left long in grass it will go 
back to its wild state." In fact, however thoroughly it may have been limed 
and cultivated, if the Agrostis vulgaris gets into it through the failure of the 
sown grasses, instead of improving under pasture, it will speedily become 
unproductive of every crop that may be afterwards sown in it. 

The three plants, tben, sown in our grass lands do not answer on all soils, 
even for the three years required in the common alternate cropping; but when 
they are trusted to in land sown out for permanent pasture, their deficiencies 
become much more striking and hurtful. The lied Clover disappears altoge- 
ther the second year ; and, even in the richest soil, the Ray-grass does not con- 
tinue permanent. It totally disappears also, in a space of time, which may 
be longer or shorter in proportion to the richness and dryness of the land, 
but which rarely exceeds four or five years, even in the land most favourable 
to it. So totally wanting is the plant in very old pastures, and in rich pieces 
of natural grass that may be seen on the banks of the rivers, and in the edges 
of the glens of this district â€” excepting, perhaps, at a few pathways, or in the 
neighbourhood of farm-steadings, where a few seeds may have been scattered 
from the neighbouring cultivation â€” that we are fully entitled to conclude, that 
the Ray-grass is not a native, and that it would speedily disappear in this part 
of the kingdom were cultivation to cease in it. The result of the failure 
of the Red Clover and Ray-grass is worse here than in the alternate hus- 
bandry. If the soil is poor, the Agrostis takes possession, and the pasture is 
never of any value. Even on the richest soils, the valuable native pasture 
grasses become established slowly and irregularly ; and before that takes 
place, the land is often extensively occupied by various useless or pernicious 
weeds, with which they are afterwards unable to contend. Hence the great 
differences, in point of value, that are often seen existing between fields of 
old pasture, although of similar soil and exposure. One may be seen, which, 
having been favourably situated for incidentally receiving a supply of seeds 
of the good grasses from some neighbouring piece of rich pasture, is highly 
valuable ; and another, equally rich and kindly by nature, yet, from a want 
of a like supply, overrun with many useless weeds, or occupied by grasses 
which cattle dislike. 

Such are the imperfections of those plants which are almost exclusively 
sown for hay and pasture in this part of Scotland. It is quite obvious that 



OBSERVATIONS ON NATIVE GRASSES. Vll 

it would be very desirable to find substitutes for, or additions to them, with 
two separate views : â€” 1st, To secure good pasture in the alternate husbandry ; 
and, 2dh/, To make a permanent pasture that shall be good from the begin- 
ning, and continue so. 

We shall first inquire which of our native grasses will supply the necessary 
desideratum in the alternate husbandry, on damp land. It is in vain to say, 
in respect of many damp soils, that they ought to be effectually drained by the 
cultivator, and then they will produce good crops of Ray-grass. On a generally 
retentive or impermeable subsoil, the expense of such draining as would make 
the land quite fit for Ray-grass, would be very great. It would often, indeed, 
be of a magnitude not to be vindicated by any prospect of a corresponding 
return ; as we may perceive at once when we advert to the circumstance that 
there are extensive tracts of good soil, of that intermediate state of dryness 
which is well adapted for raising productive crops of oats, but yet unfit for 
Ray-grass. In such cases, the expense of draining would be incurred for 
the sake of the Ray-grass ; and it is better therefore to look out for a grass 
more adapted to the soil, than, by a costly and otherwise unnecessary pro- 
cess, to adapt the soil to the grass. 

The account generally given of the failure of Ray-grass, in damp soils, 
is, that they spout out the grass. It would, however, be the true and simple 
explanation to say, that we have sown in them a plant not fitted for them 
by nature. On looking at the little uncultivated margins at the fences of 
rich damp fields, we generally observe them covered with a dense herbage 
of various grasses, which cattle, when they find access to them, eagerly 
feed upon. These, then, are grasses which the soil does not reject, as they 
are adapted by nature to grow in it. If we can find one or more of them 
perennial, and at the same time having the properties of being liked by cat- 
tle, giving an abundant produce, furnishing also a largequantity of seed which 
may be easily collected, and dying like the Ray-grass when turned down 
by the plough; we have then a plant which may here be substituted for the 
Ray-grass, or at least sown along with it to supply its deficiencies. 

The Poa trivialis, a plant growing abundantly by nature in all such situ- 
ations, possesses, in great perfection, all the above properties. It delights in 
damp land, and gives there a very abundant produce. Horses and black 
cattle prefer it to almost all other plants. It furnishes seed in much greater 
profusion than the Ray-grass itself; and, having like that also a fibrous root, 
it dies on being ploughed down. It is somewhat later than the Ray-grass; 
but, to balance that deficiency, it grows more into the autumn. 

I have very successfully cultivated this grass for several years past, and 
can give a very favourable account of it. Having some enclosures on my 
small farm, and pieces of land within others, of a damp retentive nature, 
that disadvantage, already described, became very conspicuous in them, viz. 
that the Ray-grass, although thriving pretty well in them for one year, failed 
almost entirely the second and third years of grass. To have altered the rota- 
tion of cropping on these enclosures, so as to take only one crop of grass, 
would have inferred the derangement of the rotation on the whole farm, and 
a complete alteration of all the enclosures. It was observed that the Poa 
frivialisgrtw in profusion and luxuriance on their uncultivated margins, where 
it continued very permanent, and the idea readily occurred of collecting its 
seeds and sowing them in the cultivated ground. The experiment has 
answered admirably well ; and the pasture on the damp land which formerly 
failed, through the aid of this grass, is now very close and valuable. I de- 
voted a small corner of a field to the production of this grass alone, with 
the view of easily obtaining from it a supply of the seeds. In this, too, 
the success was complete. The land so employed did not exceed sixteen 
poles, and sufficient seed was got yearly from it to sow six or seven acres. 



Vlll APPENDIX. 

The thrashed hay, got at the same time, was in respectable quantity, and more 
acceptable to horses and black cattle than any other hay whatever. The 
small piece of land was four years under the grass, and afterwards gave a 
more than ordinary good crop of oats. The grass was equally good all the 
four years. 

But the way in which I have chiefly cultivated this grass is not by itself, 
but by adding a proportion of the seeds of it, for damp fields or damp pieces 
of fields, to the common allowance of Kay-grass, and of the Red and White 
Clovers. The Ray-grass and Red Clover furnish the principal part of the first 
crop, which is generally cut for hay, and the Poa trivialis and White Clover 
make a close pasture the next two years. 

The seeds of the Poa trivialis are minute. A bushel of them consists of about 
eight times as many grains as the same quantity of Ray-grass seeds. They are 
heavier than Ray-grass seeds of equal measure, in the proportion of about 
three to two ; and from these proportions we find that four pounds weight of 
the seeds of the Poa will produce as many plants as a bushel of the seeds of 
Ray-grass. The Poa tillers more abundantly ; that is, produces more culms 
from the same plant, in rich land, than the Ray-grass. These remarks will 
indicate the proportion of the Poa seeds to be sown upon an acre. When 
they are first thrashed out, they are entangled and matted together by a vegetable 
fibre, looking like a spider's web, which uncoils from the base of" the seeds ; 
but by drying them perfectly on a floor, and turning them carefully, the web 
falls to powder, and they may then be readily mixed with other seeds, and 
sown with equal facility. 

On moist soils, the Poa trivialis is equally valuable for permanent pasture 
as for the alternate husbandry ; or we should say, more so. It is, in fact, the 
plant, as may be discovered on examination, that forms the chief produce 
of the damp places of our finest and most celebrated old pastures. 

There is another native grass which I have successfully cultivated for hay, 
and which T have found to be a tolerable pasture grass also, on wet pieces of 
land, over some depth of moss. It is the Holcus lanatus or Meadow Soft 
Grass. It must be confessed, however, that, in its green state, it is not so 
acceptable to cattle as many others, and there is therefore a prejudice against 
it, the extent and authority for which it would be wrong here to conceal. 
My experience of the value of the Holcus lanatus, on peaty soil, is similar 
to that of Mr. Menteath,* excepting that, the soil I cultivated being te- 
nacious enough for oats, the grass seeds were sown with that grain, like 
other common hay seeds. The produce of hay was large, and the after pas- 
ture abundant in quantity. Although the cattle would no doubt have pre- 
ferred pastures of other grasses, yet, when confined to this, they prospered 
well upon it. It is said, in the Hortus Gramineus Wobumensis, that the hay 
of the Holcus lanatus is disliked by cattle, especially by horses. This, cer- 
tainly, I have not observed respecting the hay I made from it. Both black 

* It is necessary to explain that, in Mr. Farquharson's manuscript, there is at this 
place a quotation regarding Holcus lanatus from a " valuable sketch of the Geology 
of Netherdale, by James Stewart Menteath, Esq. younger of Closeburn." It ought 
also to be mentioned that, while all Mr. F.'s own observations and opinions are care- 
fully retained, the liberty has been taken of omitting, in general, his researches re- 
garding the " inquiries and experiments of distinguished writers, who have more at 
large devoted their time and talents to the illustration of this important subject." Mr. 
Farquharsou will also excuse me for omitting a dissertation which, however excel- 
lent, is not exactly suited to this publication, upon a point that, in his own words, 
" is of such importance to the agriculturists of that part of Scotland to which Dr. 
Murray's Flora refers (and in which oats form the chief grain produce), that we 
cannot resist taking advantage of this opportunity briefly to discuss it. The point 
is the very great advantage which this part of the kingdom has derived from the 
introduction of early varieties of oats."â€” A. M. 



OBSERVATIONS ON NATIVE GRASSES. IX 

cattle and horses have always readily eaten it, and thriven well while doing 
so. Perhaps the difference of the experience in this matter may be owing 
to a difference in the way of curing the hay. We know that, in England, 
hay is generally allowed to heat in the stack ; and this may have been the case 
with that procured from the Holcus lanatus at Woburn. The hay I made 
was, according to the Scotch method, fully dried in the field, and underwent 
no heating in the cole or stack. 

The seeds of the Holcus lanatus are easily procured. They are nearly as 
large as those of Ray-grass. The plant is very liable to be mistaken, and 
has been often mistaken, for the Holcus mollis, the most inveterate and injuri- 
ous weed, on damp sandy soils, which the cultivator has to contend with. The 
most obvious distinction between the plants is, that the Holcus mollis has a 
creeping root â€” being the Couch-grass or remack of wettish sandy land. The 
Holcuslanatus has a fibrous root, and dies on being completely ploughed down. 

In conclusion, it is to be carefully noticed of this grass that it is recom- 
mended only for peaty soils, where certainly its produce so far surpasses that 
of any other grass, as to make its other imperfections be overlooked. The 
seeds are very liable to get among those of the Ray-grass ; but this ought 
to be prevented ; for on dry land its cultivation would not be commend- 
able. There its produce would not be superior in point of quantity, to 
compensate for its other imperfections. 

We proceed next to consider which of our native grasses may be best 
adapted to supply the failure of the Ray-grass on the poorer dry lands â€” 
which, as already remarked, takes place, leaving them to be overrun with 
the useless and even hurtful Agrostis vulgaris. 

Nature here also points out a grass which will answer the purpose. The 
uncultivated edges of our fields, and the dry tops of their earthen fences, 
are occupied often by the Festuca duriuscula. I have had occasion to make 
many incidental observations on the value of this grass for such soils, al- 
though I have never cultivated it, having indeed in my possession no land 
that much requires its aid. I have noticed it naturally sown, on the outsides 
of poor fields, by seeds dropt from the plants on the turf fences, and forming 
a close and valuable pasture, almost to the exclusion of the Agrostis, after 
the Ray-grass had gone out. It is not quite so early as the Ray-grass, but it 
is much earlier than the Agrostis, and fills the soil before that shoots up ; and 
it grows late into the autumn. Its natural situation, frequently on the turf 
coping of stone walls, demonstrates that it stands drought well. It is a grass 
that tillers greatly, sending up from each plant a great many culms, and a 
large tuft of radical leaves. The root is fibrous, like that of the Ray-grass, 
fitting it for the alternate husbandry ; and it is equally fit for permanent pas- 
ture â€” being perennial, and enduring perfectly the severity of a northern cli- 
mate. The seeds of the plant are very abundant, and may be easily collect- 
ed. In a bushel there are about the same number of grains as in a bushel of 
Ray-grass seeds. 

Another grass, which partially occupies the borders of such fields, and 
which is, indeed, more universally disseminated, by nature, over almost all 
the soils of the district than any other grass, excepting the useless Agrostis, 
is the Cynosurus cristatus. This, therefore, might be sown in part on the 
poor soils, along with the Festuca duriuscula. Its qualities will be more 
particularly described among the grasses for perpetual pasture. In recom- 
mending it and the Festuca duriuscula for the poorer soils, in the alternate 
husbandry, it is not meant that they should be substituted for the Ray-grass; 
but that a proportion of them should be added to the usual allowance of Ray- 
grass. The latter gives an abundant produce for the first year, and if it should 
fail the two succeeding years, the Festuca and Cynosurus will remain, and 



X APPENDIX, 

form a close turf, so as to exclude the Agrostis so natural to such soils, or at 
least to prevent it from appearing in any injurious abundance. 

Our last object in respect of the grasses is to ascertain those which are 
best adapted for permanent pasture. 

After examining with attention a considerable number of the most valuable 
old pastures in the district, those, indeed, which are proved to be so by the 
infallible criterion of their bringing, for a succession of years, the highest 
rents from the graziers, I venture to say that they are composed chiefly of 
the following grasses, along with White Clover and Yarrow (Achillea Mille- 
folium), viz. Alopecurus pratensis, Poa trivialis, Poa praiensis and Cynosurus 
cristatus. In some of the driest there is also seen not a little of the Festuca 
duriuscula. Not that these form the herbage exclusively ; but where other 
grasses, as the Agrostides, the Hold, or even Anthoxanthum odoratum, have 
got in, in any abundance; there the lower rent marks the inferior esteem in 
which the fields are held by the graziers, in comparison with those where the 
four grasses first named occupy the soil, nearly exclusively, along with the 
White Clover. 

We place, then, at the head of the list of grasses for permanent pasture, 
the Alopecurus pratensis or Meadow Fox-tail Grass. 

This grass is generally found growing in abundance on the uncultivated 
margins of all the richer old infields of this district, and it has many valuable 
qualities which adapt it for a pasture grass. It springs up earlier than any 
other native grass excepting the Anthoxanthum odoratum. Cattle delight in 
it, as may be observed by the closeness with which they eat down the mar- 
gins of the fields referred to, when they can have access to them. The pro- 
duce is abundant, especially of radical leaves,in the production of which the 
energy of the plant is chiefly expended; for it sends up comparatively few 
seed culms. I have had some experience in cultivating this grass, which 
has confirmed my observation of these qualities and habits in it, and laid open 
also some others, and therefore I shall give a brief account of it. Some years 
ago, I laid out a small piece of land, of a few poles, with this grass alone, in 
the hope of easily collecting seed from it for further experiment. The seeds 
first sown were gathered from the edges of the neighbouring cultivated fields. 
It produced a close crop of radical leaves, which, however, was not heavy 
the first year, but became larger each succeeding year, during four years it 
remained ; and the crop of the last year was a heavy one. It did not send 
up flowering stems, in any considerable quantity, till the third and fourth 
years; and even then, their number was proportionally less than in any other 
grass. After the four years, the land was ploughed for oats ; but the grain 
crop on it failed greatly in comparison with that of the rest of the field, 
which was after other grasses ; and the cause of the failure was observed to 
be that the Alopecurus, though not having, properly speaking, creeping roots, 
yet had a number of vegetable crowns, which were not killed by being 
ploughed down, but set up a vegetation injurious to the oats. At another 
time, I sowed a parcel of the seeds got from the seedsmen, mixed with the 
usual allowance of Ray-grass and Clover, on a piece of land too wet for the 
permanence of Ray-grass, in the hope that it would form a pasture after that 
failed. In the third year, the Alopecurus did, indeed, form a good pasture, 
which was more closely eaten down by the cattle than any other part of the 
field. This being included in the alternate husbandry was then all broken 
up for oats; when, as in the other case, the Alopecurus adhered to the soil, 
injuring the oat crop, and forming a troublesome weed, which it was difficult 
to get rid of in the succeeding turnip crop. The result of this limited expe- 
rience in its cultivation is, that it is totally unfit for being admitted into the 
alternate husbandry; but, at the same time, it became obvious that it is 



OBSERVATIONS ON NATIVE GRASSES. XI 

eminently adapted for permanent pasture. It does not, indeed, arrive at 
perfection the first year, like the Itay-grass, nor even the second; but in- 
stead of going out, as that does, it improves by age. It ought certainly, 
therefore, to form one of the grasses sown for such pasture. 

In a bushel of the seeds of this grass, there are only about two-thirds of the 
number of grains contained in a bushel of the seeds of Ray-grass. On account 
of the habit of the plant in sending up only a few culms ; the seeds are difficult 
to be procured. They are, besides, liable to be abortive, or eaten by insects ; 
and I have noticed that they drop suddenly after they are ripe, and while the 
culm is yet green. This circumstance should be attended to by those who 
collect them, that they may cut the plant early. 

The grass next named of the four is the Poa trivialis. Of that we have 
already given an account, in recommending it for the alternate husbandry. 
It occupies naturally the moister parts of the fields, and is unfit for very dry 
lands ; yet it has a considerable range of land in respect of being wet or 
dry, that it occupies very well. It produces heavy crops in places partially 
inundated by springs, and in the bottoms of ditches through which their waters 
flow; and, at the same time, may be seen forming the chief part of the pas- 
ture on land, which, though damp, is not yet unfitted for the turnip hus- 
bandry. 

The substitute for the Poa trivialis, on very dry land, is its congener the 
Poa pratensis. These two plants are very like each other ; but the trivialis 
may be very readily distinguished by its culm being rough to the touch, and 
by its oblong acute stipule, that of the pratensis being short and abrupt. 
The pratensis has a creeping root or couch, which renders it unfit for the 
alternate husbandry. This root, however, I have had occasion to notice, is 
the most easily overcome, in cultivation, of all the couches or remacks ; 
generally dying on being ploughed down, if drought succeeds. Notwith- 
standing this imperfection, and that plants with creeping roots are said to 
exhaust the soil, it forms such a large proportion of our best native and old 
pastures, on dry land, that nature thus indicates it ought not to be dispensed 
with, in laying out permanent pasture in such land. It is considerably earlier 
than the trivialis, and cattle almost equally delight in it. 

The seeds of the pratensis may be as easily procured as those of the tri~ 
vialis. They are somewhat larger than those of the trivialis ; and a bushel of 
them has only five or six times as many grains as a bushel of Ray-grass. 
When newly thrashed out, they are connected together by a stronger web 
than that of the trivialis ; but this, too, disappears by keeping them on a dry 
floor and turning them. 

The fourth grass named, as partly forming our best pastures, is the Cynos- 
urus cristatus, or Dog's-tail grass. This is the grass which forms the most 
valuable part of the fine herbage, on the rich margins of our streams which 
have never been subjected to the plough ; and on uncultivated steep banks of 
fine pasture, which may be seen in some places in the midst of arable fields. 
It enters largely, indeed, into old good pasture every where; and thus is in- 
dicated as a grass which ought always to be sown in part for permanent pas- 
ture. It has a great range in occupying both moist and dry soils. In dry 
soil its roots penetrate vertically to a great depth, and its new branches or 
crowns are formed under the surface. Hence, it continues green and pro- 
ductive in a dry season after most of the other herbage is withered. At the 
same time it may be seen occupying very damp places. It is not particular- 
ly early, but it continues to send up fresh leaves in autumn, later than any 
other good pasture grass. Horses, black cattle, and sheep, equally delight 
in it. While the leaves of this grass are so valuable, and so much relished 
by beasts, the seed culms are wiry, and rejected by them ; a wise ordination 
of nature to secure the continuance and extension of so important a plant. 



Xll APPENDIX. 

They are named provincially windlestraws ; and on old pastures are often 
seen in such abundance that a sufficient quantity of the seed, for the purposes 
of the cultivator, might be soon gathered, by hand, from his own land. In 
this climate, the seeds ripen about the end of July or beginning of August. 
They are nearly twice as heavy per bushel as the seeds of the Ray-grass ; and 
the bushel of them, as they are small, consists of about four times as many 
grains as a bushel of Ray-grass. 

It has been already noticed that, besides these four grasses, the Festuca 
duriuscula is not of unfrequent occurrence in the drier parts of our more 
valuable pastures. That species also may therefore be introduced, in part, 
in dry places. 

Many other grasses have also been recommended for permanent pastures, 
of which some notice should therefore be taken, although I do not feel en- 
titled to recommend any of them. The chief are the Phleum pratense, Dac- 
tylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Agrostis alba or stolonifera. 
I conceive it might be a sufficient objection to the introduction of the 
two first, that, although not unknown, they are certainly not common; 
and their absence, in a great measure, from our most valuable old pastures, 
affords the highest presumption that there is something in the soil or climate 
unfavourable to them. But I would say farther of the Phleum and Dacty~ 
lis, that beasts are not fond of them. A small piece of uncultivated land, 
natively planted with the Phleum, is included in one of my fields. The 
field has been often pastured by beasts enclosed in it ; and although the herb- 
age was not at all times over abundant, the Phleum was never touched by 
them, but both leaves and stems were allowed to grow up and wither 
together in autumn. 

Dactylis glomerata is also highly recommended in the Hortus Gramineus 
Woburnensis, both for the alternate husbandry and permanent pasture ; and 
yet there are, in that valuable treatise, certain admissions respecting it which 
I must be permitted to refer to, as vindicating the unfavourable opinion which 
I have learned, from my own observation, to entertain of it. Thus, in p. 
138 (3d Edition), it is acknowledged, there is a " necessity for keeping this 
grass closely cropped, either with cattle or the scythe, to reap the full be- 
nefit of its superior merits as a pasture grass." It is allowed, too, in the same 
page, that it is not permanent but in deep dry land ; and, in p. 39, that 
it formed only one plant of every twenty in celebrated pastures. After these 
admissions, I may venture to state, without being deemed guilty of pre- 
suming too much, in the face of such high authority, that, although the 
Dactylis is not common in this district, there are yet a sufficient number 
of patches of it, in my immediate neighbourhood, to have enabled me 
clearly to ascertain that beasts certainly reject it, unless urged to eat it by 
hunger. As to the Anthoxanthum odoratum and Agrostis alba, the same 
objection does not come against them ; viz. that they are not common in the 
district â€” for they are both abundant. The Anthoxanthum is seen every- 
where ; but it is never eaten by beasts that can find any thing else. The 
Agrostis is in little better favour. It is the latest of all the grasses; but, to- 
wards the end of autumn, it covers swampy places with a large, coarse, 
prostrate herbage, which cattle entirely neglect, till the fields are otherwise 
quite bare. Then they may eat a part of it, when they can get no other 
green thing. Mr. Don of Forfar, a high authority â€” in discussing the merits, 
or rather pointing out the demerits, of this grass, at a time when it got 
temporarily into repute for cultivation, under the Irish name of Fiorin â€” says 
of it and the Agrostides in general, "that nothing but necessity ever com- 
pels cattle to eat them." 

But although we thus cannot find more grasses fit for permanent pasture, 
in this district, to be added to the four or five already described; yet we 



OBSERVATIONS ON NATIVE GRASSES. XIII 

must not be led to suppose that our pastures, when composed only of these, 
will therefore be deficient. There is among the five a sufficient variety, in 
respect of their earliness, to give a succession of young herbage during all 
our warm months. The Alopecurus pratcnsis comes into full vigour with the 
first warm weather; the two Poas, and on very dry land the Festuca duri- 
uscula, afford a fine pasture when the summer is more advanced ; and the 
Cynosurus continues to send up young leaves, till it is finally checked by 
frost. 

And here we may remark that, as the Alopecttrus is some years after it is 
sown before its plants arrive at perfection, it will be advisable to sow, with 
the permanent grass seeds, the usual allowance of Ray-grass, to give, for 
some years, an early produce in its place. 

There is one advantage attending the limitation of the number of our na- 
tive grasses fit for being used for permanent pastures in our soil and climate, 
which is of no small importance. It is, that the expense for seeds will be 
diminished. The seeds of the Poa trivialis, Poapratensis, Cynosurus crista- 
tus, and Festuca duriuscula, if it shall be deemed expedient, may be all se- 
cured within the district, by the cultivator himself, with as little attention, 
on his part, as the securing his Ray-grass seeds requires. The Poa seed, 
especially, will cost little trouble or expense. The seed of the Alopecurus 
pratensis alone is that for which he will need always, it is to be feared, to 
have recourse to the seedsman. 

The Festuca ovina has been recommended for gentlemen's lawns, on ac- 
count of the fineness of its leaves; but I should think this not a very desirable 
grass in such situations. The herbage, when in full vigour, in summer, is 
very liable to assume a brown or reddish-brown colour, under a strong sun. 
The plants send up innumerable flowering culms ; and as the budding crowns, 
to form these, sprout latterly above ground, each plant, in good soil, becomes 
a semi-globular tuft, which does not coalesce well with the neighbouring her- 
bage. In winter, these tufts remain grey and withering, without soon rotting 
and dropping down, as the dead leaves of many other grasses do. The 
true grass for lawns is the Cynosurus cristatus. The budding crowns of 
that grass are all formed under the surface of the ground; and the herb- 
age, for this reason, continues smooth and even, without ever rising into 
tufts. The leaves of this grass, too, are of a very elegant green, and the ver- 
dure continues late into the autumn. Sheep eat the plant closely down ; 
and, accordingly, a pasture composed chiefly of that grass, when stocked 
with these animals, becomes, under their feeding, nearly as smooth as if 
shaven with the scythe. A few ivindlestraws are no doubt always seen where 
this grass prevails; but surely the unsightly culms of no other grass may be 
more easily cut down than these, and advantage may be taken, by cutting 
them at the proper season, to obtain a quantity of the seeds of the grass. 

I shall end with a notice of a grass which is not a native of this district, but 
which experience within my observation has shown, might be profitably in- 
troduced to occupy ponds and marsh lands, that do not profitably admit of 
draining; and which, in this district, are generally occupied by Fquiseta, 
Carices, and other entirely useless plants. It is the Poa aquatica, now 
named Glyceria aquatica. This was introduced into a pond of half an acre, 
having a muddy bottom and from two to three feet deep, by a gentleman in 
my neighbourhood, twenty- five years ago. It has occupied the pond with 
the most luxuriant and ornamental vegetation, and grows up yearly with con- 
tinued vigour, to a height of six or eight feet above the water. It has, in 
this case, been little eaten by beasts, being preserved as an ornament; but, 
when black cattle can get it, they eat it with great readiness. In the Hortus 
Gramineus Woburnensis there is an account given of the remarkable produce 
of this grass, in the fen lands of England, which is five or six times the weight 



XIV APPENDIX, 

of that of any other grass. It is there said, "It is, when dried, excellent 
fodder for milch cows, but horses are not fond of it," and that the inhabitants 
of the Fens call it/odder by way of eminence. It is added, that it does not 
grow freely from seed, except when sown in mud, and that the best method 
of propagating it is by parting the roots, which, from their creeping nature, 
soon increase the number of plants. Although not a native, its long con- 
tinuance, and remarkable luxuriance in the pond referred to, demonstrate 
that it will prosper, in a suitable situation, in our climate.
