PREFACE. 

IN the enlightened ages of Greece and 
Rome, and under the moft flourifliing 
{late of Arabian literature. Botany, as a 
fcience, had no exiftence* Nor was it till 
ibme time after the revival of learning, that 
thofe combinations and diflinftions were 
cfFei^ually difcovered, which, in the end, by 
giving rife to fyftem, have raifed the ftudy 
of plants, to that rank it holds at prefent 
in the fcale of knowledge. 

If in the contemplation of flowers, man* 
Jcind at large, have in every age placed one 
of their pureft pleafures, how greatly muft 
thefe delights be enhanced to the enamoured 
votary of Botanical Knowledge ! who, whilft 
he furveys that wonderfully varied elegance 
and beauty, which charm the eye of all, 
penetrates ftill farther, and at the fiinie inÂ« 
ftant, difccrns alfo, thofe analogies and dif- 
A 4 criminations.

aflbciations and diftindtipns, which are veil- 
ed from tjic untjiught eye of common pb- 
fervation, howfoever fenfible to* the general 
l^eauties of Nature ! And hence, indepen-t 
dently of its real and ultimate utility, from 
the acceffipn of knowledge it brings to the 
Materia Medic^, and by its general afliftance 
|o the various arts and elegancies of life, the 
iludy of the vegetable kingdom, has prov- 
ed, to numerous fpeculative and inquifitive 
piinds^ the fource of much intelledlual en-r 
jbyment^ 

This Science is, by many, confidercd as 
of fo eafy attainment, that it is not unufual 
to affign the name of Botanift, to ai^y mar^ 
whpfe ipemory enables him to repeat the 
nomenclature of perhaps a few hundred 
plants ; howfoever uninfprmed he may be, 
pfthofe principles which entitle him, to the 
real name and charader ; With equal juf-

fokly to the inventor of it. By this de- 
grading idea, men of the firft learning and 
talents in thi? branch of knowledge, have 
frequently been levelled with the moft fu-Â» 
perficial enquirers, and the moft ignorant 
pretenders. Hence alfo this Science, which 
even in a fpeculative view, holds no mean 
!-ank, and, confidipred praftically, is clofely 
connected With medi(;ine, anci with the ^rts 
and elegancies of life, has been held forth 
as a trifling and futile employment. la- 
truth, he properly is entitled, in any ^tgrec^ 
to the diarafter of the Botanift, whofe agr 
quirements enable him to inveftigate, to de-* 
fcribe, and fyftematically arrange,, any plant 
which comes under his cognizance. . But 
to thefe abilities, in order to compleat the 
character, fliould be united, an acquaintance 
with the Philofophy of Vegetables, ^nd 
with the Hiftory of the Science, in all its 
feveral i;elations, both literary and praftical, 
from remp.te antiquity to his own time : at- 
tainments which require a competent fharc 
of general learning, and no fmall degree of 
painful toil and patient induftry, both in the 
^elds and in the clofet.

X PREFACE. 

If this defcription of the Botanlft be a 
troe one, it manifeftly excludes a number 
of frivolous pretenders ; the fcience itfelf 
fifes in importance, and admits of great di- 
vcrfity of employment, to the tafte^ the ta- 
lents, and learning of thofe who direft their 
attention to it. Whilft then it is the pro- 
vince of fome to inveftigate new fubjedts, 
to afcertain thofe imperfectly known, and 
to record the various improvements and dif- 
coveries of the day, let it be that of others, 
to do juftice to departed merit, to recall the 
fcattered remembrances of the Hves,and hold 
out the example of thoie who have labour'^ 
cd in the fame field before them. ! 

In tracing the progrefs of humai, know-. 
ledge through its feveral gradations of im- 
provement, it is fcarcely poffible for an in- 
quiiitive and liberal mind, of congenial taile, 
not to feel an ardent wifh of information 
relating to thofe perfons by whom fuch im- 
provements have fevcrally been given : and 
hence arifes that interefling fympathy which 
almoft infeparably connects biography with - 
the hiftory of each refpedive branch of 
knowledge. 

In 



PREFACE. Xi 

In this age, when fuccefsful advance^ 
ments in the ftudy of plants, have fo far 
extended its pleafures, as to render Botany 
almoft faihionable; and at a time, whea 
Biographical writings find a reception here- 
tofore unknown ; it became matter of fpc- 
Culation, that no one fhould have delineated 
the Rife and Progrefs of Botany in Britain ^ ia 
connexion with the lives of thofe who have 
contributed to amplify and embellifli it. 

Among the various enquiries which em-p 
ploy the pens of the learned, none perhaps 
afford more general fatisfadion, than fuch 
^s relate to the origin and progrefs of fcience 
and literature. But when thefe lead to ob- 
jefts which we love and cherifh, they come 
reconimended by a charm that fecures a 
welcome, and thus promife a more peculiar 
fcntertainment and gratification: however, 
difquifitions of this kind are of difficult ex- 
ecution, efpecially when applied to fubjeds 
of a fcicntific nature, as requiring the union 
of various talents in the writer â€” an appro- 
priate fhaf^ of learning, an extenfive .literary 
as well a$ pradkical acquaintance with the 
fubjed, united to all thofe qualifications re- 

quifite 



XU PREFACE* 

quifite in a biographer^ fuch as diligence and 
accuracy in invcftigating the difcoveries of 
his authors, and impartiality in chanuSleriz* 
ing them, and in affigning to each his due 
degree of merit. To thefe perfbnal requifites 
muft be added, the adventitious circum- 
ftances of a fituation favourable .tg his re- 
fearches, not only from manufcripts, and 
large libraries, but from aftual intcrcourle 
with the learned. 

Fully fenfible in this view of the little 
claim I have to the charadler and advan- 
tages here fpoken of, it becomes neceflary, 
to avoid the cenfure of temerity, that I 
Ihould premife fome account 9f the original 
pccafion of this attempt. 

The attention I had given to Englifli Bo- 
tany in my younger days, had prompted me, 
at one time, to plan a F/ora of the plants 
of this kingdom, on an extenfive fcale ; 
including, befides the medical and (Econo- 
mical hiftory of each, a Pinax, in which 
it was my defign to have diftinguiflied, as 
far as I was able, the firft difcoyerer of each 
fpecies, both among foreign writers and 
thofe of our own kingdom; and to have 

arrange^ 



Â» R E F A C Â£. tin 

isirranged all their fynonyms, at large, tinder 
each plant, in chronological order* To 
fuch a work the following Jketches^ in a 
fomewhat more contracfied fortii, were in- 
tended as an introdudlion. In the mean 
time, if more important avocations had not, 
the want of neceffary affiftance from books, 
would probably have flopped the progrefs 
of a plan of fuch extent. Although this 
purpofe was relinquifhed, yet, as the mate- 
rials were coUeded, and this part of the 
defign was independent of the other, I flat- 
tered myfelf, that, having made fome al- 
terations, and enlarged the whole, under fo 
total a want of any fimilar work, thefe anec- 
dotes might aifFord information to young 
Botanifts, and poffibly fome amufement to 
thofe of more advanced knowledge in the 
fcience. 

Although botanical writings are the prin- 
cipal objefts of thefe pages, yet, as feveral 
' of thefe authors were confpicuous for their 
various attainments in different branches of 

* literature, their other purfuits and publica- 

* tions, where my refources have afforded 
iopportunity, have occafionally been recited; 

and 



XlV P R Â£ P A C SÂ« 

and I have been more particularly iblicltout 
to collect into one view^ under each author^ 
thoie various temporary and occafional pro^ 
dudions, which, after the eftablifluneiit of 
the Royal Society, were conmiUnicated to 
that body, and form a part of the Philofo^ 
phical T^ranfaStions. 

In coniidering the botanical writings^ 
efpecially thofe of the firft eminence, I have 
had ]:ecourfe, with few exceptions, to the 
books themfelves ; but, confined to a pri-^ 
vate collection, have yet too frequently had 
occafion to regret the want of more exten-* 
live afliftfuice; and, although I have not 
formally quoted my authorities, on every 
occafion, they will be fufficiently manifeft 
to all fuch as are converfant in botaniciil li^ 
terature. In the hiftorical and biographical 
parts, the mod material and authentic fadts^ 
have likewife been derived from the refpcc- 
tive authors in botany : and, not unfrequent-^ 
ly, I have availed myfclf of feveral of the 
older periodical publications. Exclufively 
of thefe, befides collateral afliftance received 
from feparate works, and from various col- 
le(aions of fmaller bulk, I more efpecialjy

volved in obfcurity by length of time, fu- 
perftition raifed them to the rank of gods. 
Thus, in the early ages of mankind, as now 
among the ftill unlettered and uncultivated 
nations of the earth; the adminiftration of 
fimples> for the cure of wounds and difeafes, 
was almoft ever accompanied with fuper- 
ftitibus ceremonies and incantations. Hence 
too, in procefs of time, the charafter of the 
prieft and the phyfician was united; and 
the fick reforted to the temples of the gods 
for relief: and, although inveftigation and 
rational fcience made flow progrefs, yet, 
in every nation, from the moft cultivated to 
the moft barbarous> the number of fimples 
ufed for medicinal purpofes, became by 
degrees very confiderable. Thus, when, 
at length, phyfic aflumed a more regular 
form> and was taught in the fchools of 
Greece, the writings of Hippocrates 
enumerate three hundred vegetables ufed 
in phyfic. Four centuries afterwards they 
were augmented by Dioscorides to near 
feven hundred ; and to thefe the Arabians 
added no inconfiderable number of valuable

articles. There is room to believe, that 
the antient Gymnofopbtjis of the Eaft, pur- 
fued the ftudy of plants, with a fuccefs 
equal to that of the Greeks ; and the mo- 
dern nations of the Eaft, the Japonefe, the 
Chinefe, and the Brachmans of India, incon- 
teftibly excel the enlightened nations of 
Greece and Rome, in their knowledge of 
Botany : witnefs the " Garden of Mala- 
bar," which comprehends near eight hun- 
dred plants ; all which are defcribed, and 
the virtues recorded, with an accuracy and 
precifion, uaexampled in the antient au- 
thors of Greece and Rome. But to approach 
nearer home : the Druids of Gaul^ and of 
Britain, cultivated the knowledge of herbs, 
with no inconfiderable diligence. Whether 
thefe antient Magi of the Weft, who were 
both priefts and phyficians, fprung from 
thofe of the Eaft, and thus derived their 
knowledge from a common fource, a point 
which has hitherto divided the learned, or^ 
whether their fcience was thfe refult of their 
own inveftigation, I muft leave to the cri- 
tical antiquary to determine.

PRUIDICAL BOTANY, 

In the mean time, in tracing tlie origin 
and progrefs of botanical fcience in Britain^ 
a furvey of its ftate in the druidical times, 
ought to claim the firft attention ; but in 
fa(3:, the little information tranfmitted to us 
from the anticnts, relating to this extraordi- 

I nary fe<ft, being alrnoft whoJly confined to 
Ccefar and Plinyy precludes any enlarged 

' view refpeding my particular obje<3:. It is 
from Pliny we learn> that to the mijfeltoe^ 
the vervain^ the felago^ and the famolus, 
thefe antient fathers of druidifm attributed 
efficacies almoft divine; and ordained the 
collection, and adminiftration of them^ 
with rites and ceremonies, not ihort of re- 
ligious ftridnefs, and fuch as countenan- 
ced the groiTeft fuperftition. 

The mijjeltae^ for inftance, muft be cut 
only with a golden knife ; muft be gather^ 
ed when the moon was fix days old ; the 
prieft cloathed in white ; the plant received 
on a white napkin j; and laftly, two white 
hulls were to be facrificed ; and thus con- 
B 3 fecrated.

fccrated, mifleltoc was an antidote to poiibA 
and prevented fterility *. 

The mijfeltoe perhaps, is, of thefe plants,^ 
the only one fully afcertained at this, time. 
Its parafitical growth, the preference 
which the Druids gave to that which grew 
on the oak, aflifted by the defcriptions the 
antients have left of it, will fufficiently juf- 
tify the application to the vifcum of the 
moderns. May I i;iot add, that probably, 
amidft the manifold virtues antiently af- 
cribed to this plant, its power of curing 
the falling-ficknefs, which has accompa- 
nied it almoft to the prefent time, is the 
remnant of druidical ufe and tradition ? 

The vervain^ after previous libations of 
honey, was to be gathered at the riijng of 
the dog^ftar ; when neither fun nor moon 
flione ; with the left hand only; after de- 
fcribing a circle round the plant, &c, i and 
thus prepared, it vanquifhed fevers, and 
other diftempers ; was an antidote to the 
bite of ferpents, and a charm to conciliate 
friendship â€¢f'.

,the modem botanifls have now agreed to 
-confine the term to the verbena^ which 
â€¢Pliny has dcfcribed, as having narrower 
4and fmaller leaves than: the oak, it may be 
remarked^ that there has been a diverfity

lating to the plant ; and it is acknowledged 
that verbena QX verbenacea^ was alfo applied^

Tufcans apply the word vervena to flips,

Thc/e/ago was not to be cut with iron ; 
nor touched with the naked han4 but with 
tht fagum ; the Druid cloathed in white, and 
his feet naked, with other magic ceremo^

became a remedy for difeafed eyes, and a 
^harm againft misfortunes *â€¢

having only dcfcribed it as like xhtfavin ; 
a dcfcription which will accord with a va- 
riety of plants of Europe. Moft authors^ 
neverthclefs, have agreed, from this refem*- 
blance, to confidcr it as a fpecics of wolfs^ 
claw m$fsj which is now called lycopodium 
felago. C-ffisALPiNUs, however, thinks it 
was zfedumi and Guilandinus, an erica^ 
or heath, and probably with more reafon. 

Various, but equally fuperftitious, were 
the rites attendant: on the famolus^ which 
was^given to preferve oxen and fwine from 
difeafes. 

This is a plant of which ftill greater 
doubts remain, Pliny having faid nothing 
further of it, than that it grew in moift places. 
Hence the name is applied to a plant called 
round^leaved brooklime y but, as forming a 
.&parate genus in modern arrangements,* it 
has acquired the name given as above, from 
Plirr^. Others have thought it a fpecies of 
fulfatilla^ or .pafque-flower ; fince one of 
that kind retains, among the Bolognefe, the 
name oifdmiglo.

uncertainty attending the application of the 
inames of plants from the antients, arifing 
from their vague and indccifive dcfcriptions, 
I add, that Mr. Lightfoot thinks, there 
are fuiSicient traces in the highlands, of the 
high efteem in which the Druids held the 
quicken^trce, or mountain a(h i forbus au-*

other tree, found planted in the neighbour- 
hood of druidical circles of ftone?, fo often 
feen in Scotland. Poffibly this fadt may be 
more equivocal than the fuperftitious ufes 
to which it is ft ill applied. It is believed, that 
â€¢a fmall part of this tree carried about them, 
is a charm againft witchcraft and enchant- 
ment. The dairy-maid drives the cattle 
with a fwitch of the roan-trec^ for fo it is

Short, andimperfea, as this view of Drui-i

by Pliny, yet there can be no doubt that 
the Btitons, like all other rude nations, 
drew their medicinal fources from the fim-Â» 
pies growing arouhd them, answer? there- 
fore well acquainted with common plants. 
And, although there are not, as far as I 
know, any herhals extant in the antient 
3ritifh language, or in any tranflation from 
it, by which the degree and extent of their 
knowledge may be precifely afcertained| 
yet, as far as refpedts the nomenclature 
merely, fome reafonable eftimate may, I 
apprehend, be formed from the lift of ff^e/cb 
names of plants, preferred by (^erard, as 
conununicated to hipi by Mr, Davies of

communicated by the Rev. Mr. Stuart^

The two following occur in the Bodleian :

nens virtutes berbarum. Sax-

I ahi unable to determine whether the 
above are the fame with the two following, 
which Dr* Ducarel notices from the Har-* 
leian collection : 

5066* Entitled, Herbarium. Sax* 
onice. 

585; TraSiatus, qUi ab Anglo^Saxoni^ 

bus dicebatur Liber MfeDi^ 

cinalis* 

The laft is faid to be an Anglo-Saxon 
verfion of Apuljsius, whom I fhall have 
occafion to mention hereafter. The date 
of this tranflation is of the tenth century. 
The Saxons having been converted to 
Chriftianity at the latter end of the fixth 
century, the communication between BrU 
tain and Rome became by degrees very fre- 
quent. 



Safcon Botany^ t$

duced into thefe realms* 

The golden age, if I may be allowed 
that exprefflon, of the Anglo-^Saxon learn-^ 
ing, was the reign of Alfred the Great â€¢ 
That munificent prince not only himfclf 
tranflated Latin authors, but, as hiftorians in-Â» 
form us, encouraged ^n every way, the tranf- 
fufion of all the knowledge of the times into' 
the common language of the kingdom. To 
this sera, therefore, may reafonably be refer- 
^ red the Saxon verfion of Apuleius ; whofe 
book feems to have preferved popularity 
through all the middle ages, and Was found 
in common ufe at the sera of printing. 

As no publication of any Saxon herbal 
has ever taken place, we are unable to de- 
fine the extent of the knowledge of that 
time: at prefent, therefore, as in the in- 
ftance of antient BritiJIo Botany, we can 
only recur to the nomenclature of the in- 
digenous names, by which fome of them 
are yet known ; although many others have 
given way to Greek and Latin terms, and* 
fome to other revolutions, occafioned by the 

gradual 

t 



l6 CHAPTSRI. 

gradual progrefs of reformation throughout 
the fcience in general. 

A lift of the Anglo-Saxm names would 
be recoverable, in a great degree, by recur- 
ring tQ the old herbals, to Skinner's Lexi- 
con, and other authorities of that kind. It 
would, I am perfuaded, be more exteniive 
than a fuperficial view might fuggeft, and 
would do credit to our Saxon anceftors. 
I cannot help remarking, that many mif- 
takes have probably arifcn from the negleft 
of our firft reformers of Botany in England, 
after they had formed fcientific names, in 
not preserving alfb the old and provincial 
terms ; and that, on the whole, this ne- 
g^edl has retarded the progr^f? of knowledge 
on this fubjedt.

Schools were eftablifhed, in which Aris*

writers, were ftudied ; and their dodtrines^ 
at length pervaded the whole dominion of 
the Saracens^ and finally fiourifbed 'm the 
univerfities of Spain^ 

DioscoRiDES, though in a corrupt and 
mutilated ftate, formed the bafis of know- 
ledge in the Botany and Materia Medica of 
the Arabians. The lituation of Bagdaf, 
and its connection with Lidiay allowed them 
fcope to introduce into phyfic feveral ufe- 
ful fimples. Among others, we awe. to 
thefe Orientals the milder purges of the

It is riot eafy, however, to ju^g^t With 
J>rccifion> of the extent of Arabian know- 
ledge on the fubjcdl of our work ; fince^ 
probably^ the beft book of the Arabian 
iibhool has yet remained unpubliflied, that 
of Â£^Â« Be I THAR. It is extant in the Pa- 
rifian, the Efcurial, and other libraries* 
This learned Arab was, particularly attached 
to the botanical branch of phyfic. He 
was born in Spain \ and after vifiting Africa^ 
travelled into the Levant, AJia^ and even as 
fiir as th^ Indies, to improve his know* 
ledge. In his return he was patronifed by 
Saladin^ at Cairo ^ and died in 1248* 

Herbelot informs us, that from thd 
fuperiority of his learning in this branchy 
he was ftylcd Afcbard^ or The Botanift* 
He wrote '* A General Hiftory of Simples^ 
or of Plants, ranged in alphabetical order/' 
in which he gives the Greek, Arabic, and 
vernacular names % with the dafcriptions of 
each ; and particularly, in a more detailed 
manner, ^hofe not defcribed by Dioscori^ 
i3ES and Puny. 

There is, notwithftanding, but little room 

to believe, that more original knowledge 

C 2 could 



20 CHAPTER 2. 

could be derived from the Arabian montlÂ«Â« 
ments of fcknce in this, than in the other 
departments of phyfic. In their befl: aa- 
thors> even the Greek names of plants are 
Â£o grofsly perverted^ that they are fcarcely 
to be knovirn. 

The Grecian authors having been inac- 
curately tranflated at firft> and the language 
negleded afterwards^ phjrfic loft much un- 
der the dominion of the Arabians. It was, 
in the end, a corrupt Galenic theory, with 
an admixture oi ajlrology and fuperftition. 
In this ftate the learned of Europe found 
it, in the celebrated Moorish univerfi'ties qH 
Spain. In the weftern parts of Chriften- 
dom, efpecially after the lapfe of the Latin 
tongue in Italy ^ it was fcarcely kfs obfcured 
by the ignorance of the Monks, by whom, 
. almoft folely, the pradice of it was cn- 
groiied. 

Even the firft univerfity in Chriftendom, 
the renowned fchool oiSakrnum^ founded by 
Charlemagne in the beginning of the ninth 
century, received its didates from the cor- 
rupt fources of the Arabians ; whofe works 
arc faid to have been at length tranflated 

into 



Middle Ages. 21 

into Latin by Conjiantine the African. The 
famous precepts de Confervanda Valetudine, 
ifiued from that fchool for the ufe of Ro-* 
bert (Juke of Normandy, were, without 
doubt, well known in England, and proba-^ 
bly excited attention to the ftudy of Vege- 
tables ; concerning which, numerous rules 
and cautions occur in that remnant of the 
learning of thofe days. 

During all thefe ages, the original fources 
in the Greek authors were almoft wholly 
forgotten, and the productions of that long 
iiight of fcience were equally rare and un- 
improving. 

I fhall, neverthelcfs, enumerate briefly a

of Lucius Apuleius Madaurenfis^ whofc

there is room to believe, was, at that time, 
more diffufed and popular in England^ 
than any other, Thfe author, who lived 
in the age of the Antonines^ was born at

tbage^ and at Athens^ and for ibme time ap- 
plied himfelf at Rome to jurifprudence, but 
at length quitted it, and devoted himfelf 
wholly to phiioibphy and phyfic. He is 
well known as the author of the Miltjiah 
Fables, and other works of learning* His 
book De Herhis, Jive de Nominibus ac 
Virtutibus Herbarum, alone comes under 
our cognizance : In this he recites the 
names of medicinal herbs, in the Greeks

The reftoration of thefe lages of anti*

iti of commentators. Every plant was 
fought for, and every plant was difcovered^ 
in the works of antiquity. Ko drug ufed

It is a mortifying reflexion in the annals 
of human knowledge, that the bulk of thefe 
learned men, after their immenfe labours^ 
miftook, in numberlefs inftances, the roadi 
to truth, and did but perplex the fcience 
they wifhed to enlighten. The defcriptions 
of plants in the antient authors, were^ at 
beft, fhort, vague, and infuflicient ; and 
with this inconvenience, the ftudy of nature 
herfelf was negledted. In the niean time, 
there arofe a genuine fct of cultivators, 
who, difcovering this error of the commen- 
tators, iludied plants in the fields, where 
alone the beft comments could be made. 
As the foremoft of thefe, Aands BauNs- 
FELsius. He was followed by Tragus, 
FucHsius, Val. CoRDUs,' Gesner, Cje^ 
SALPiNUs, and above all Clusius, to 
' whom mud be added our own countryman 
Turner. Still, even among thefe genuine 
reftorers of natural knowledge, nmny did 

not 



Middle AgeSf 39 

not fufficiently recoiled:^ that all the plants 
of DioscoRipES, were not thofe oi Europe^ 
but principally thofe of Afia ; whilft> in- 
(lead of ttraverfing the fields of Greece, Cihr 
cia, and theEaft^ they were ilraining all the 
jdeicriptjons of this author, to accpntuno* 
date them to the vegetables of Europe. It 
}s not ftrange that their endeavour; were 
but little fuccefsful. Even, after the la- 
bours oi Rauwolf^ who traveried Syrifli 
MeJbpt^tQtnia^ Palejitne^ and Mgypt, in the 
^teenth century, and thofe of the enlight- 
ened TouRNEFORT in the prcfent, it doe^ 
|iot appear, that of the feven hupdred plani^ 
in the Materia Medica of Dioscorioes^ 
more than four hundred, at thefartheft, are 
properly aÂ£xrtained at (his time. 

We learn from Pliny (lib. 25. c. 2.) 
that there were paintings of plants in his 
4ayi but he complains, that, through thf? 
iiiaccuracy of copiers, they w^re not to be 
depended on. Salmasius tells ys, he 
infpedted a Greek MS. of DioscpRipES 
more than a thoufand years old, in which 
fhe plants were figure4 with fufficient ele- 
gance indeed, but with little regard to truth

and exadl rcfemblance. There arc now 
cxifting feveral manufcripts of Dios co- 
lt IDE s^ with illuminated figures, particu- 
larly the famous one in the imperial library 
at Vienna, of which Lambecius treats 
largely. 

It was procured by Bujhequiusy the em- 
peror's refidcnt at Conjlantinople, about 
1560; and is faid to have beeii copied at 
the expence of Juliana Anicia, daugh- 
ter to the emperor Flavins Anicius Olyber^ 
about the year 492. It has been regretted 
by fome of the learned, that this MS. had 
not been brought earlier into Europe \ by 
which means the commentators might have 
been faved much trouble. Antient, how- 
ever, and fplendid as this is, it may juftly 
be doubted, whether the publication of it 
would have much conduced to the reftora- 
tion of ancient Botany, and Materia Medicai 
fincc, if we are allowed to judge of the 
figures, fi-om the fpeciniens copied by Do- 
DONuEUs, nothing can exceed the rudenefs 
of them, or more flrongly juftify the re- 
mark oiSalmqfius. And as feveral of thefe

In juftice, howevet, to thefe valuable re- 
mains, it muft be obferved, that, from later 
information, we find, there is, befides this 
Conjiantinopolitan MS, which is in folio, an- 
other, fuppofed to be more ancient, in 4to. 
which is diftinguifhed by the'name of Nea- 
foliian: that the figures in both thefe agree 
extremely well ; and, as Haller informs 
us, are fufficiently exaft to enable the bo-

Finally, that if thofe enumerated in the

muft be wholly attributed to the fault of 
the copier or engraver. This intelligence

HpRTUS SANITATIS, 

IT was not till fevcral years after the asra 
of printing, that any original work, 
ftridly botanical, made its appearance, even 
on, the continent; and ftill longer before 
England produced any publication of im-* 
portance in that way. 

Previous to the firft dawning of this fci- 
cnce in England^ it is almoft ncccflary to 
mention fome of the prpdudipns abroad, as 
they were the bafis qf what was here firft 
publifhed, although^ in fad, there was no 
original work before the Herbal pf Tur- 
ner. 

In the opinion of Segujer, the firf^ 
book on plants, with figures, was printed

at Augjlurgb^ foon after the invention of 
Wooden cuts, or tables^ between the years 
1475 and I478> in the German tongue^ 
with the title of '' The Book of NatureH" 
It treats of animals and plants ; of the lat* 
ter, a hundred and feventy-fix kinds are no- 
ticed, and many of them figured^ The work 
is made up chiefly from Pliny, IJidore^ and 
Tluteariusi 

This book fcems to have been foon fu- 
perfeded by the famous Herbal of Mentz, in 
1484, ftiled fimply ** Herbarius;*' which 
gave rife, the next year, to the well-known 
work Ortus Sanitatis, afcribed tc^

was at leaft the editor of an enlarged and 
improved edition. This Work, Under dif- 
ferent editors, vvas the bafis of all the Her^ 
bah of "Europe^ for many y6ars. 

Its objcd: is the Materia Medicd from all 
nature ; but vegetables occupy the greater 
part. The firft edition was comprifed in 
four hundred and thirty-five chapters : in 
one, printed at Venice in 1511, which is in 
the black letter, they are extended to d

This volume is of the fmall folio form i

There is no author's name to it; but 
there are indubitable traces of its being^- 
bricated from the Hortus Sanitatisy and pro-* 
bably from the French tranflation of that 
work, printed by Caroni at Paris y in 1499^^ 
with feme alterations and additions. 

It abounds, with the. barbarous and mif-*

doubtedly the work which Turner refers 

to

he obferves, that, ** as yet there was no

The general Order is that of the alpha-*^ 
bet, according to the Latin names, each 
fubjedl forming a chapter, in the whole five 
hundred and five ; of which, more than four 
hundred refpe(9: the vegetable productions i 
and of thefe one hundred and fifty bear the 
names of jplants which are natives of Eng^ 
land: but the writer remarks no other dif-* 
tincflion, by which they are known from 
the exotics* The names are given in La- 
tin and Engliih, but throughout the whole 
icarccly any defcriptions. The qualities, 
whether hot or cold^ dry ,or moiji^ accord- 
ing to the Galenic mode of the time, is in- 
variably noticed, followed generally by a 
prolix account of the difeafes to which the 
plant is applicable, and the method of 
ufing it.

BOTANICAL GARDENS. 

The revival of Botany, and the confe- 
qucnt eftablifliment of profefforfhips, gave 
rife to Botanical gardens ; a new fpecies of 
luxury in horticulture, of fingularemolumcnt 
to fcience. Thehiftory of antient gardens, hi- 
therto not fufficiently illuftrated, merits the 
inveftigation of the moft learned and able 
writcr:ofthepenofaRAPiN,aMjÂ£URSius,^ 
a Seguier, or a Gronovius. We learn, 
however, that even Botanical gzrdcns are of 
antient date. If it may be credited, what is 
related of Attalus, the laft king of P^- 
gamiis, who from his love of phyfic has 
been ftiled the phyfician, he cpUedted in his 
garden JbelleSore, ^henbane^ aconite^ and other 
poifonous herbs, to make experiments ojji 
eriminals with counter-poifons. Crete, from 



Botamofl Gardens. 53 

the carlicft times renowned for tbe produc 
tion of medicinal herbs, was the phyfic-gar- 
den of Rome. The Emperors, we are told, 
maintained in that iiland, herbarifts, and 
gardeners, to provide the phyficians of Rome 
with fimples. Cq/ior, a Greek, praifed 
both by Pliny and Galen, is faid, not 
only to have written many volumes con- 
cerning plants, but to have had a garden at 
Rome, in which, Pliny relates, that Cas* 
TOR, at upwards of an hundred years of 
age, demonftrated plants, and taught him 
to diftinguiih ieveral rare and ufeful ^Â« 
cies. 

The utility of thefe inftitutioiis are ielf^ 
^ident. By public garderl8Â» medicinal 
plants are at the command of the teacher 
in every le^n. By private ones, the eye, 
and the tafte of the opulent and fcientific 
owner, is perpetually gratified with the 
fucceiiion of curious, fcarce, and exotic 
luxuries ; in comparing the doubtful ipccies,. 
and exapiining them through all the ftages 
of growth, with thofe to which they are 
allied. Add to which, that all thefe ad- 
vantages are accumufeted in a thottÂ£md ob*

j^as at the &me time, The firft public 
inftitution of this kindj iix more modenv 
times^ was that of Padua by the Venetians^ 
in the year 15 ^3Â» Lu<;a$ Ghin^us^ the^ 
firft public prpfeflbr of Botany in Europ^^ 
was .ailrchuou8 prqinoter of the iame-der- 
figflsj and by his influence procured the 
eflabliihment of a garden at Boiogna^ ixk 
1547, where Turner himfplf* imbibed 
much of that knowledge, which afterwards 
gave him fvKcb prf^rninence in lis own 
eoqntry. 

Among, thle earlieft private gardens of tho 
fame kind, was that of Euricius Corpus, 
the diic^lecef the ^nerablf Leonicbnus, 
andof Manard-us, two of the firft cook-

He not only delineated plants himfelf, but 
maintained, at his own cxpcnee, a draughtf- 
roan and engraver, for the fame purpofes. 
Turner appears to have had a ggrden for 
rfire plants, even during his refidence. at 
Cokgn.. In England he records the garden 
^ the duke of Swterfei^ at Sion Houfe^ of 
^hich: he feems to luve had the direc*

TH E hiftory of Englifh Botany to thia 
period^ from its impcrfcd, and even 
barbarous ftate, may perhaps not unaptly 
be confidercd ^s the fabulous age of the 
fcience among us, But we are now arrive4 
^t the true Era of its birth in England. 
I cannot call it the reftoration, fince this 
nation, like Italy in the flourilhing ftatcf 
of Rome^ had never been enlightened by the 
writings of Greece. It was much later be* 
fore the works of thofe fages reached this 
Idngdom. Manufcript copies of the Pa tresi 
BoTANici, as hath been before pbferved, 

were 



burner. 57 

were exceedingly ra^-c; and the language 
itfelf in which they are written, had made 
imall progrefs in England. 

On this he^d, indeed, my fources of in- 
foraiation are very narrow j as far'as they 
reach, I am not able to find, that one ma- 
nufcript of Theophrastus exiftcd at this 
period, in any of the public libraries of 
England. Of Di os cor ides, there arc two 
MS$. in the Bodleian^ N*3637, which bear 
the title of ** De Herbarum Natura et Vir^ 
tutibus, cum Iconibus ekgantibusJ' And in 
the fame colledtion, N" 840, an Arabic 
vcrfion of the five books, cum Nominibus ^ 
ffioma Hyde adjeStis. Of Pliny, there is 
faid to be an entire copy in Baliol library, 
N* 279; an imperfedt one, of eighteen 
books only, in the Norfolk colleftion, N^ 
2996 I and an epitome, in Trinity-cpUege, 
Cambridge^ N* 459* 

Even of the works of Hippocrates, 
Scarcely any were known except his Apffo^ 
rifms and Prognojlics i and Linacre firft 
made the Englifh phyficians acquainted 
with Galen. But to return; the true Era 
pf Botany in England, muft commence 

with 



5$ CHAPTER 5. 

with Dr. William Tqrmer, who wa& un* 
queftionably the carlicft writer among as, 
that difcovered learning and critical judg-* 
ment in the knowledge of plants; and 
whofe ** Book of Herbs," as Dr. Bul- 
XETN obfcrves, ** wUl always grow green, 
Â«* and never wither as long as Diofcoridti is 
** held in mind by us oMM^tal wights." But, 
h^ore I turn my attÂ«vtion to Torner, 
I will remark, that, in an interval of 
thirty-four years between die firft edition 
of â€¢â™¦ Th$ Crete Herbal," in 1 516, and that 
of TuRHER, in 1550, J have it not in my 
power to refer to any publication on my 
iUbjea;, in the Englifh tongue. That there 
were tranflations of ieveral of the writers of 
the middle ages, has been noticed.. Among 
thpfe, on the continents there were feveral 
\tif whofe means Botany made a rapid pro- 
grefs. The principal were Bru:nsfels.ius, 
gvRiciua. CoRDUÂ«, RuELLius, Vokrius 
CoRDUS, FucHsius, and above all Ges- 
NER, who, poffefling a genius and induf, 
try, almoft unparalleled in thefe ftudies, coniÂ« 
prchended this rifing branch of knowledge, 
-with a njor? expanded view tlian any of his 

predcQeflbrs, - 



predeceflbrs, and extended its bounds bcycrad 
the limits, which, till that time. Materia 
Medica alone, had prefcribed to it. But 
Gesner's talents, though in Botany they 
were original, were ftill more confpicuous 
in his knowledge of the animal kingdom; 
in which, his writings will long be valued 
and efteemcd, by thofe efpecially, who^ 
without painful refcarches, would fee an- 
tient literature in a concentrated view. I 
fpeak not of his abilities as a phildlogift 
and critic, in which chara^Srers he held a; 
iJiftinguifhed place. But to proceed, 

William Turner was born at M)r^ 
teth in Northumberland^ and educated a^ 
Pembroke coUegc,. Cambridge^ under ih^ 
patronage and afliftancc of &tr Thomas 
}Ventworth.\ I find him a ftudent qf that 
pollege about the year 1538, where heac-.. 
quired great. reputation for his learning. He 
applied bimfelf to philofophy and phyfic, 
^nd parly difcovered an inclination to the 
ftudy of plants, and a wifli to be well ac- 
quaintedi w^th |he Materia Medica of the 
^ntients* 

He complains qf the littl? aiBftance he 

fpuld 



^O CHAPTER 5* 

could receive in thefc purfuits. *' Being 
^ yet a iludent of Pembroke hall, whereas 
** I could learn never one Greke, neither 
^* Latin, nor Englifli name, even amongft 
" thephyficians, of any herbe or tree : fuch 
*^ Vi^as the ignorance at that time ; and as 
*' yet there was no Englifh Herbal, but one 
â€¢* all full of unlearned cacographies and 
^' felfely naming of herbes/* 

At Cambridge^ Turner imbibed the 
principles of the reformers, and afterwards, 
agreeably to the pra<5tice of many others, 
united, to the character of the phyfician, that 
of the divine. He became a preacher, tra- 
velling into many parts of England^ and 
propagated, with fo much zeal, the caufe 
of the reformation, that he excited perfe-. 
cution from Bifliop Gardiner. He was 
thrown into prifon, and detained a confix 
derable time. On his^^largcment, he fub* 
niitted to voluntary exile, during thc^ re-Â» 
mainder of the reign of jHi?Â«'ry VIII. 

This banifliment jproved favourable to 
his advancement in medical and botahical 
ftudies ; he refided at Bajil^ at Strajhurgb^ 
at Bonn ; but principally at C(/logn^ with 



burner. 6t 

many other Englifti refugees. He dwelt 
for fome time at Wiejfenburgh ; he travelled 
into Italy, and took the degree of Doilor 
of Phyfic at Ferrara. As, at this period, 
the learned were applying with great affi- 
duity to the illuftration of the antients, it 
was a fortunate circumftancc to Dr* Tur- 
ner, that he had an opportunity of attend- 
ing the lectures of Lucas Ghinus, at Ba^ 
logna, of whom he fpcaks in his " Herbal*^ 
with great l^tisfadtion ; and frequently cites 
his authority againfl other commentators^ 
Ghinus was the firfl: who ereded a fepa- 
rate profefforial chair for Botanical fcience; 
from whence he gave lectures on Diosco* 
RIDES, which he continued for twenty- 
eight years with great applaufc. He pro- 
cured the phyfic-garderi to be founded at 
Bologna, to demonftrate the plants he fpoke 
of. He was the preceptor of CicsALPi^ 
Nus and AN6UII.LARA, who became two 
of the foimdeft critics in the knowledge of 
plants^ that the age produced. Turner 
r^ded a coniiderabld time at Bqfi/, from 
which place he dates the dedication of his 
book " On the Baths of England and 

** Germany.'* 



$1 C H A ^ t E R ^* 

*â€¢ Germany/* During his refidencc in SisiU^ 
zerland^ he contradcd a fricndihip with 
Gesner, and afterwards kept up a corre-- 
^pondcrice with him. 

Gesner had a high opinion of Tur-^ 
KER, as appears by the following paflagc 
in his book De Herbis Lunariis^ printed 
in 1555. " Ante antios 15, aut circiter

At the acceffion of Edward VI. he re*

a divine, was rewarded with a Prebend of

ry of Wells. He fpcaks of himfelf in the

the caufc of the rcfQiniation^ which he liad 
amply tcftificd by fevcral religious tradts^ 
induced him to retreat to the continent, 
during the whole reign of Mary. At her 
dcccafe. Queen Elizabeth reinftatcd him 
in all his church pneferments. In the de- 
dication of the compleat edition of his 
** Herbal" to the queen, in 1568, after 
complimenting her majefty on account of 
lier ikill in the Latin language^ and the 
Euency with which ihe converfed in it, he 
acknowledges with gratitude, her favours in 
reftoring liim to bis ba;ieiices, and in other 
ways prote<aing him from troubles 5 hav* 
ing, at four feveral times, granted him the 
great ieal for theie purpo;(es. He feems to 
liaue .divided his time between his deanery, 
where he had a Botanical garden, of which 
frequent mention is made in his *^ Her<-

Ltmdon. He alfo fpeaks of ^his gardoi at

his fon Peter was educated to phyfic, tra-Â» 
veiled^ and took degrees abroad; was incor*^ 
porated dodtor at Cambridge, and at Oxford i 
and died aged 72, in 1614; but I do not 
find that he inherited his father's turn to 
Botany. 

Turner's firft work on the fubjed: of 
plants, if BuMALDus is not miftaken, was 
printed at Cologn, under the title oi^^HiJioria 
deNaturis HerbarumScboliis et Notts vallata.'* 
Colon, apud Gymnicum 1544. 8\ Bumaldus 
is the only writer, in whom I find any 
mention of this book; and I fufpedt, it . 
was not republifhed in England. It was 
followed by a fmall volume under the title 
of** Names of Her be s, in Greek, Latin, 
Englifli, Dutch, and French/* Lond. 12V 
1548. This nomenclator is, I believe, be- 
come very fcarce; fince it has not yet found 
>ts way into the copious and magnificent 
i;olle<aion of Sir Jofepb Banks. 

Dr. Turner's knowledge in natural hlf- 
tory was not confined to Botany ; his earlieft

Prcfixed to the third volume of the 
Frankfort edition of Gesner's Hijioria 
Animalium^ in 1620, we find a letter from 
DnTuRNERy relating to theEnglifh fiflies; 
which fufficiently proves, that he had no 
inconfiderable degree of knowledge in that 
part of zoology. He makes an apology for 
the imperfeftions of it, as being written from 
memory, and at a diftance from all his notes 
and obfcrvations. It confifts of three pages, 
in which he has briefly defcribed niore than 
fifty fpecies ; and it feems to be intended 
principally to giveGESNER information op 
the Engliih names^ which Turner has 
carefully noted, and often added the pro- 
vincial appellations^ He takes in both fea 
and river fifli, and includes alfo the fcal- 
lop and the cockle. This letter was writ- 
ten from Weijfenburghy and is dated Nov. i^ 
1557. He undoubtedly purfued this branch 
of zoology much farther ; fince it appears 
from his dedication to the queen, that hc^ 
intended *' to fet out a book of the namc^ 
** and natures of the fifhes of her majefty's^

Dr. Turner's '' Herbal" is priflted in 
the black letter, agreeably to the general 
ufagc of the times^ and is cmbellifhed with 
the figures of moft of the plants he de- 
fcribes. 

The arrangement is alphabetical, accord- 
ing to the Latin names ; and, after, the de- 
fcription, he frequently fpecifies the places 
of growth. He is ample in his difcrimina- 
tion of the fpecies, as his great objedt wa5, 
to afcertain the Materia Medica of the an*, 
cients, and of Dioscorides in particular; 
throughout the vegetable kingdom. To thiÂ« 
end he beftows much criticifm on the com- 
mentaries of FucHsius, Tragus, Mat- 
THiOLUS, and other of his contemporaries; 
and profefles to have correded many of their 
miftakes, in the application of the names 
^Dioscorides. In all this he has fliewn 
much judgment, and^ I may add, much 
moderation, in avoiding^ more than ufual, 
the licence taken by many of the commen- 
tators, of applying the names of plants de- 
fâ‚¬ribedinTHEOPHRASTUs,DioscoRiDEÂ§, 
and Pliny, to thofe of the weftern parts 
of Europe. What he fays of the virtues of

plants, he has drawn from thle ancients; 
but has, in numberlefs inftances, given his 
opinion of their qualities, in oppofition to 
thofe fages, and recorded his own cxperi-^ 
ehce of the virtues. He no where takes 
any doubtful plants upon truft, but appears 
to have examined them with all the preci-* 
, fion ufually exercifed at a time when me- 
thod, and principles now eftabliflied, were 
u^thought of; every where comparing them 
with the defcriptions of the antients and 
moderns. He firft gave names to many 
Englifli plants ; and, allowing for the time 
when fpecifical diftindions were not efta- 
bjifhed, when almoft all the fmall plants 
were difregarded, and the Cryptogamia almoft 
wholly overlooked, the number he was 
acquainted with, is much beyond what 
could eafily have been imagined, in an ori- 
ginal writer on his fubjeft^ 

The third part of his *^ Herbal,'* dated 
from Welles y June 24, 1 564, he dedicates to 
the company of furgeons ; and apologizes 
for its imperfedtions : " Being fo much 
'^ vexed with ficknefs, and occupied with 
*^ preaching, and the ftudy of divinity, and 
F 3 - exercife 



70 CHAPTER 5- 

** exercife of difciplinc, I have had but 
** ftnall Icifurc to write Herballes." 

In this party he profefies to treat ojti the 
plants not known to Dioscorijdes and the 
anticnts. It confifts of near an hundrc4 
articles, among which we find introduce 
many of the exotic fubjedls, which had be- 
fore been but little known ; fuch as cajfia 
fftula^ cuhebSf guaiacum^ nutmegs, myroba-^ 
lansy nux indica, nux vomica, anacardium^ 
rhubarb, farfaparillay fenna, and tamarinds. 
For thefe, many new figures were cut, 
which are executed in a ftile fuperior to 
the others. The remainder are principally 
the productions of our own country. 

Theoompleat edition of Turner's " Her- 
bal/' in 1 568, was printed at Cologn, un- 
queftionably to receive the advantage of the 
figures, probably at that time the property 
oiBirkman the printer. They .are the fame 
with which the oftavo edition of Fuchsius 
was firft printed in 1 545 ; in all five hun- 
dred and twelve. Of thefe. Turner has 
ufed upwards of four hundred j to which he 
has added about ninety new, niaking the 
whole . number five hundred and two.

There are fome inftanocs of the wrong ap* 
plication of thefe figures ^ an error that 
I3f)ight readily happen, when the author was 
at fuch a diftanice, and was common in al- 
moft all fimilar works of that time. There 
^re alfo feveraj figures to which no defcrip^ 
lion of the plants can be found; for in- 
ftance, the fix figures of the Geraniums from 
JFucHSius occur, with a flight mention of 
only two ffJecies in the text. 

Turner is the firft authof who has 
given a figure of the Lucern ; which, I ap- 
prehend, he firft brought into England^ aijd 
named Horned Clover. He treats largely 
of its cultiva^tion, from Pliny, Palla- 
pius, and Columella; 

In the dedication to the firft edition of 
fiis '^ Herbal,'' in 1551, Dr. Turner 
ipeaks in very refped:ful terms of the bo- 
tanical knowledge of feveral of his con* 
temporaries ; and apologizes for his under- 
taking fo arduous a matter, while there werp 
Jearned Engliflimen better qualified. He 
enumerates Dr. Clement, Dr. Merdy, 
Owen WooTON, ap4 Mafter Falconer.

The laft-mentioned is feveral times introdu-* 
ced in the body of the work. I can fcarcely 
doubt that he was yoAn Falconer, who 
is recorded as having communicated many 
. Englifli plants to Amatus Lusita-nus, 
who taught phyfic at Ferrara and Ancona, 
and made himfelf known as a commentator 
on DioscoRiDES in 1553. In treating on 
the Glauxy of which Turner gives a new 
figure, he fays, ** He never faw it in Eng^ 
*^ landy except in Mafter Falconers book ; 
V and that he brought it from Italy." From 
this and other like citations, it may reafon- 
ably be conjedtured, that " Fakoners Book" 
was an Hortus Siccus -, and if fo, muft have 
been among the earlieft colled:ions of that 
kind, that is noticed in England. 

In appreciating the meri^t. of Dr, Tur- 
ner as a Botanift, due rqgard muft be had 
to the time in which he lived; the little 
affiftance he could derive? from his contem- 
poraries, of whom,'BRUNSFELSIUS, RUEL-

pear to have exhibited uncommon diligence 
and great erudition, and fully to deferve the ^ 
character of an original writer. 

Our author paid early attention to mine- 
ral waters. He was probably the firft who 
wrote on the baths of Bafhy in Somerfet-- 
(hire. He vifited feveral of the mineral 
fpririgs in Germany y Switzerland y and Italy i â€¢ 
and drew up, whilft abroad, a fhort account 
of ten of thofe waters ; to which he pre- 
fixed a more enlarged hijftory of the waters 
of Bat A. This was written, as it fhould 
feem, at Ba^l, and is dedicated to his ** well- 
** beloved neighbours ofBat/j, Bri/low, Wells, 
*^ Winfamy and Chardey' March 10, 1557* 
He adjudged the principle of Bath water 
to be brimftone, and poffibly a little copper, 
from the vicinity of that metal in the neigh- 
bouring mountains. He fays, he had been 
informed, that, befides brimftone, the King's 
bath held alum, and the Crofs bath fait- 
petre ; but that he could find neither. He 
concludes his account of the baths, by a fet 
of general rules for all who drink mineral 
waters j many of which do him no difcre-

paid due honour to his merit and learn-

Contemporary with Turner lived Dr* 
William Bulleyn* Although this 
writer does not come ftridly within my 
plan; yet, as he lived at a period bar- 
ren of interefting materials, and, as we 
learn from him feveral curious anecdotes 
refpedling natural hiflpry and the ftate of 
gardening in England at that period, he 
cannot be pafled over in filence.

leyn, and his writings; but his life is 
amply written in the Biographia Britannica, 
to which I muft principally be indebted for 
my information,

He was born in the Ifle of Efyy in the 
early part of Henry the Eighth's reign, and 
was educated at Cambridge^ though> as Wood 
iays, he afterwards refided fome time at 
Oxfordi. It appears that he had travelled 
ovei* fevcral parts of Germany ; that he vifit-* 
cd Sdotlandi and had taken many tours in 
his native country ; in all which, he ftudied 
the natural productions with a zeal and 
fuccefs not common in that age* In ai^ 
early period of his life, he was much con- 
verfant about the city oi Norwich^ In June 
I550, he was inftituted to the reftory of 
Blaxhallf in Suffolk^ where his relations re* 
fided* This preferment he religned in 
1554^ Where he took the degree of doc* 
tor in phyfic, is not afcertained j but, from 
his prior attachment to phyfic, his known 
oppofition to the dodlrine of Tranfubftan- 
tiation, and the refignation of his living in 
the beginning oi Marfs reign, it may be 
fairly conjeftured, that he did not take his 
degrees in that faculty till after that period, 
"ind probably abroad. After this, we find 
him removed to the city of Durham^ where 
he pra(3:ifed phyfic, and became pofiefled of

where he became a member of the college of 
phyficians, and acquired reputation as a 
phyfician, and a man of learning. This 
event took place about the year 1560. He 
had the misfortune to lofe great part of 
his library, with his manufcript upon 
** Healthfull Medicines," by fhipwreck ; 
and after this difafter, met with mofl: un- 
juft and malevolent treatment, from a bro- 
ther of Sir Thomas Hilton^ by whom he 
was accufed of having murdered his late 
patron, who died, in fa<a, of a malignant 
fever. And although his innocence was 
fully manifefted, yet his enemy perfifting 
further in his perfecution, found means to 
throw him into prifon, for debt, where hd 
wrote a great part of his medical treatifes# 
Hq died Jan. 7, 1576. He appears to have 
been much attached to the principles of the? 
reformation. Bifliop Tanner fays he wa? 
a man of acute judgment and true piety. 

I am not acquainted with any print of 

Dr. Turner. Of Dr. Bulleyn there is

a profile with a long beard, before hk 
** Government of Health," and a whole 
length of him in wood prefixed to the 
** Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a 
coUeftion of moft of his works. He was an 
anceftor of the late Dr. Stukely, who, in 
1722^ was at the expence of haviag a fmall 
head of him engraved. 

The part of his works, which has the 
neareft connection with my fubjedl, is in 
his ** Bulwark of Defence," in fol. 1562. 

It is entitled, ** A Book of Simples, be- 
** ing an Herbal in the form of a dia- 
** logue, at the end of which are the cuts 
'* of fome plants in wood." In this piece 
he obferves, that torf/ientil, in paftures, 
prevents the rot in flieep ; and adds, that 
the fadt was (confirmed by the fhepherds in 
fundry parts of Norfolk. In his enumera- 
tion of the virtues of fimples, from other 
authors, he does not fail to record his own 
experience on the power of feveral, in re- 
moving fevere difeafes. Of the effedts of Dit- 
tander, calamus aromaticus^ the Daify, and 
others, he adduces particular inftances. It

His travels, and the great attention he had 
paid to the native produSlions of his own 
Country, had given him & comprchenfive 
view of the natural fertility of the foil, and 
climate oi England i which, from the te- 
Aour of his writings, feems to have been, at 
that time, by fome people much dcpreci-*^ 
ated. He oppofes this idea with patriotic 
2eal and concern, and alleges various ex- 
amples, to prove, that we had excellent 
apples, pears, plums> cherries, and hop?, 
of our own growth, before the impor- 
tation of thefe articles into England by the 
London and Kentijh gardeners, but that 
the culture of them had been greatly ne- 
glcdled. He endeavours to confirm the na* 
tural fertility of the land> from the memor- 
able inftance of Xhtfea peafe, on the beach, 
near Orford and Aldborough; by an im- 
ixienfe drop of which the poor were pre- 
ferved in a time of dearth, in the year 1555.

To conclude. Dr. Bullqrn'ts fpecific

but iknder. His zeal for the promotipa of 
the ufcfttl arts of gardening, the gpneral 
culture of the land^ and the conunercial ia-^ 
ter^fts of the kingdom, deferved the hlghe{l 
jgraiie, and for the inforoution he has left 
of thefe affairs, in his own time, pofterity 
owe hiw vknowledgments. 

Although the progrcfs of gardening 4oc^ 
not enter into my plan, yet I am tempted, 
in this place, to remark, that, notwith- 
ftanding culinary herbs and roots, apd m^y 
fruity, are laid to have been imported m the 
reign of Henry the Eigktb, from H^Uand 
and France ; and that the true aera of im- 
provement in this art, cannot be carried, at 
the moft remote time, beyond th? ffuxxe 
reign, yet it may juftly be doubted, whether 
it was then in fo low a ftate as hath bq^ 
ufually rcprt'fcnted. With other a|ts, i^ 

its progrefSon weftwards, that of Hijfftiauli

age ; who, although not an author himleH*, 
was indubitably a man of great attainments 
in the natural hiftory, and efpecially in the 
Botany, of his time* GerArd ftiles him 
** A fecond Diofccrides^ for his fingular 
*^ knowledge in plants." I cannot afcertain 
the date of his birth. It appears that he 
was a fellow of the royal college of pbyfi- 
cians, and that he had travelled into vari- 
ous parts of 'Europe. He had refided in 
Switzerland^ and had vifited, if not made 
fome ftay in, the ifland of Majorca. That 
he had diligently fearched both the northern 
and Ibuthcrn parts of England is manifeft, 
from the variety of rare plants difcovcred 
by him, and communicated to Lobel and 
Gerarb. He was perfonally known to 
Gesner and Camerarius, and after- - 
wards, frequently fupplied them with rare 
plants, for their refpedive Herbaria and 
gardens. 

During his refidence in Switzerland^ l& 

coUefted many plants of that country, and

TTENRT Lyte, Efq; of an ancient fa* 
mily, at Lytes^Carey^ in Somerfetjhire^ 
was the next after Turner who publifhcd 
an EngHJh Herbal. He was born in 1529, 
and became a ftudent at Oxford in the lat-- 
ter end of Henry VIII. about the year 1 546. 
He afterwards travelled ; and at Jength re- 
tired to his patrimony, where, as ff^ood Â£aLys, 
** by the advantage of a good foundation 
** of literature made in the univerfity and 
^' abroad, he became a moft excellent fcho- 
*' lar in fevcral forts of learningt" He was 
the author of various publications of the 
hiftorical kind, which are enumerated in the 
4tbefM Oxonienjes. He died at the age of 78, 

and

qjid was buried at Charltm^Mackireh in the* 
fame county. He left a fon, who drew up 
a genealogy pf ^<j///^j L for which the kiÂ«g> 
rewarded him with his pidure in gold, fetÂ» 
with diamonds; and the prince, afterwards 
Charles I. gave him alfp his pidure in 
gold. 

Although Mr. Lyte does not rank a- 
mong original writers in Botany, his work 
neverthelefs feems to have been well re- 
ceived. Even the arrangement alone would, 
inftantly give it a great advantage over.

tion from the French verfion of the Dutch 
Herbal of Dodoens, written by the au-

thirty new ones. Among thefe, fevwal aro 
IP a ilyle fuperior to thofe of Clusius and 
Gerard s fuch are particularly, the Sahia 
^tbiops I the Stratiotes akides -J the Rba^ 
or Centaurea Rhaponticum ; and others. 

Some are original : I cite only the Erica 
^etralix^ of which I find no figure prior to 
iy^^'s; that of Gerard (or, which is the 
iame, of Clujtus) applied to it by John^ 
$ONÂ» being certainly intended to reprefent 
ailother fpecies, and is accordingly referred 
to the Mediterranea by Linn^us. 

.The firft edition oi Lyte is adorned with 
a finely-cut impreflion in wood of Dodo^ 
ENS, in the thirty-fifth year of his age; 
tnd a large engraving of Mr. Lyte.s coat 
c^ arms. 

This firft edition was undoubtedly printed 
at jintwerpt to receive the advantage of the 
figures. The fubfequent editions, there- 
fore, afterwards printed in England^ arc 
without figures. It was reprinted^ as Ames 
informs us, in 1586, and in 1595; and, 
according to Wood^ by Ninion Newton^ at 
Londm^ in 1589, in quartp alfo, withouf

Lyte. 9j 

fcuts, I find editions mentioned, with the 
dates 1600 and 1619, which, if genuine, 
and not in the title-page only, is a proof of 
Its popularity; and that it was not fuper- 
feded by the larger work of Gerard in 
1597. Seguier even quotes one, fo late 
as the year 1678. 

As in the interval between the publica- 
tion of Clusius^s French tranflation in 
1557, and the Englifli verlion of it by 
XiYTE in 1578, the author had at different 
times compleated the feveral parts of hi? 
Htjiorw Plantarum^ it may be prefumed, 
that Ly TE profited by thofe works. From 
ibme of the commendatory verfes prefixed, 
it fliould feem, that Dodoens himfelf com- 
municated additions to Lyte. As I havÂ« 
not had an opportunity of comparing the, 
French vcrfion oi Clujius with Lyte, I 
cannot notice , the nature of his alterations, 
or the extent oS his additions. The intro- 
dufkion of the Engliih names was a necef- 
iary augmentation; 

In the mean time, there feems to be no 

ground for the criticifm of Threlkelb 5 

who accujfes Lyte of having omitted the

TijfATTHlAS de Lobel, though not 
a native of Britain^ contributed fo 
largely to the emolument of Englifh Bo- 
tany, that he juftly claims attention in the 
objed of this work* Lob el was of Fle- 
mifli extradlicn, and was born in 1538 at 
Lijle^ where his father was in the profcf- 
fion of the law. 

He informs us, that, at the age of fix- 
teen, he was enamoured with the love of 

plants ; 



Lohl. 97 

plants ; and had an unconquerable defire to 
know the names and properties of thofe 
ufed in phyfic. He fludied at Montpelier^ 
under the famous Rondeletius. Dur- 
ing his refidence there, he travelled over 
the fouth of France in fearch of fimples^ 

At Narbone he formed a connexion with 
P^/^r Pen A, who was jointly concerned with 
him in his firft work the Adverfaria. On 
leaving France^ he extended his refearches 
by travelling over Switzerland, the county 
of Tyrol, fome parts of Germany, and Italy ; 
and on his return fettled as a phyfician at 
Antwerp, and afterwards at Delft. He 
was then made phyfician to William Prince 
of Orange, and to the States of Holland. 
On what occafion he removed into Â£/?g-- 
land, or at what period of his life, I cannot 
afcertain; From the circumftance how- 
ever of the Adverfaria bearing date at Lon^ 
don in 1570, it fhould feem to have been 
before that time, which opinion is fome- 
what corroborated, by his informing us, 
that Dr. Turner had given him, " long 
before," the feeds of the^^ kale. 

In England, he obtained the patronage of 
Vol. I. H Lord 



gS CHAPTER?. 

Lord Zouchj whom he attended in t^(pL^ 
in his embafly to the court of Denmark^ 
T^ is tour furnifhed him with further 
fncans c" augmenting his knowledge in 
Botany; andi through the correlpondence 
he formed there, of introducing into England 
feveral exotic rarities, before that time un- 
known to this country. He had thefuperin- 
fcndance of a garden at Hackney ^ which he . 
calls a phy fie- garden,^ cultivated at the ex- 
pence of his patron. He was afterwards 
ftiled Botanifl to King Jamesy as appears 
fey the imprimatur to the fecond edition of 
the Adverfariai and by his own letter 
prefixed to Gerard's *' Herbal." Whether 
any emolument was annexed to this title, I 
am unable to decide. He had a daughter 
married to a Mr. James Coel, who lived 
at Highgate^ near London i and it Is pro- 
bable, from the very frequent mention that 
Lob EL makes of that place ia his laft- 
work, the Iliuftrationesy that he refidcd ia 
the latter years of bis life with his fon-in-Â» 
law. 

He died in 1616, aged 78. There was a 

print of LoBÂ£L, but it is very fcarcc^ I have

The firft of Lobel's publications, and 
^Which more eminently agrees with the de- 
fign of this worki as it brought a large' ac- 
ceffion toEnglifh Botany^ was the Stirpium 
Adverfaria. The profefled intention of this 
Work was to inveftigate the Botany and 
materia medica of the antients, and parti- 
cularly of DioscoRiDES j and Lobel is 
judged to have correifted the errors of 
Matthiolus, u|^on that author, in many 
inflances. 

As Pen A was jointly concerned %vith 

LoBEL in this work, it is become impof-. 

lible, at this time, to aflign to each^ theif 

feparate fhare. The firft edition of the 

Adverfdria^ dated at London 1570^ was 

dedicated to the queen. This dedication 

was omitted in an edition printed at Ant^ 

iverp in 1576. Editions bearing date 1571, 

I$J2, are recorded, but it may be doubted 

^whether thefe were more than title-page 

alterations. To that of the whole Adver-^

Purfoot alfb, is prefixed luQ'BzV^ Animad^

In the execution of this work, there is 
exhibited, I believe, the firft fketch, rude 
as it isk of a natural method of arrange- 
ment; which, however, extends no far- 
ther than throwing the plants into large 
tribes, families, or orders, according to 
the external appearance, or habit of the 
whole plant or flower; without eftablifli- 
Mig any definitions or charafters. Th^ 
-ivhole forms forty-four tribes. Some con^ 
H 3 tain 



Jr02 CHAPTER 8, 

tain the plants of one, or two modern gem 
nera: others many; and fonie, it muft b^ 
confefled, very incongruous to each other. 
On the whole, they are much fuperior tq 
DoDOENs's divifionsi and fufficiently tef- 
tify, that the author was fenfible of the 
want of a better arrangement than the mere 
alphabetic order, or that formed from the 
fuppofed qualities, and ufes in medicine. 

At the head of each tribe, or family, he 
prefixes a fynoptical view of all the fpecie? 
to be defcribed under it. ' His methpd, then^ 
is to give the Greek and Latin name; and^^ 
wherever he can, the name of the genus 
and fpecies, in German^ Dutchy French^ 
and Englijh, Then the defcriptiori of th^ 
plant, the time of flowering, the country in 
which it grows fpontaneoufly; and, in Eng-^' 
landy he points put the particular fpot, 
%yhere fome of the more rare are found : 
Mr. Ray, however, has remarked, that ia 
this refped Lob el has been inaccurate, or 
trufted too much to his memory; fince 
many have been fought for in yain, in the 
ijtuations he fpecified. Frequent reference 
is made in the margin to the figures in

wanting. Lobel's own figures are fmall, 
*nd infufficient in marty cafes to exprefs the 
habit of the plant, the delinieation of which, 
was almoft jhe extent of the efforts of thofe 
days, 

LoBEL having carefully ftudied the an- 
tients, on the Materia Medica; having tra*- 
veiled much, and feen plants in various 
jcountries, was enabled to exercife critical 
ikill, and to dctedt numerous errors iipi the 
difpenfation of fimpks, which he does not 
fail to point out. ^ His ftrong attachment to 
the ftudy interefted him "powerfully in the 
inveftigation of new plants, and enabled him 
to make large acceffions to knowledge. He 
|:ravelled over various parts of England^ and 
difcovcred many vegetables before unnoticed. 
He added to the grajfes a number of new 
fpecies; and, although his ftile is univer- 
sally condemned as harfh and incorredt, and 
his defcriptions frequently pbfcure and in- 
fufficient, the Adverjdrla has^ on the wholes* 
great merit, abounding with much curious 
fntclligcncp^ and fomc new difcoveries.

The fecond part of the Adverjaria is but 
a fmall part of the whole. It prefents us 
with a lift of one hundred and thirty fpeÂ« 
cies of grades, known to the author : this is 
followed by the figures and defcriptions of 
feme new and rare kinds, of the fame tribe. 
A number of new plants of the liliaceous 
and bulbous-rooted order; a copious ac-r 
county with a figure, of the yucca^ lately 
introduced ; concluding with a catalogue 
from Clusius, of thirty-eight varieties of 
Anemone â€” a proof of the flourifliing flate of 
the Florift's art, in the beginning of the 
laft century; at which time it is certain, 
from Lobel's book, that many people were 
very afliduous in the cultivation of exotics. 

In 1576, LoBEL publifhed a book, well 
known, and much quoted fince, by the 
name of " Observationes ; five Stirpium 
Hifioriae^ cut annexum eji Adverfariorum Vo^

By the affiftance of Planting this volume 
was accompanied with i486 figures, which 
had been cut for the works of Clusius, 
Matthiolus, and Dodon^eus. 

In 1 58 1 it was tranflated into Dutch, to-

augmented to the number of 21 16. The 
iame year the icons were feparately caft off^ 
on paper of the oblong form 5 the figures 
amounting to 2191. Some of thefe im- 
preffions were accompanied with an indesr, 
in feven languages, which rendered it a very 
popular book for many years. It preferves 
fome value to this day, as being the edi- 
tion that LiNNJEUs quotes throughout his 
works. 

Lob EL had meditated a very large work, 
which was to have borne the title of ** II- 

^* LUSTRATIONES PlANTARUM y but he 

lived not to finifh it. Some of his papers 
fell into the hands of Parkinson, and were 
incorporated into his Theatrum. A frag- 
ment of the above-mentioned work was 
publiflied by Dr. How, in 1655 ; which 
contains the defcriptions of many grafles, 
and other plants newly difcovered, or lately 
introduced. Of the graffes, many here re- 
<:orded were firft difcovered by^LoBEL, The

There is " an Herbal to the Bible," faid 
to be written by Thomas Newton, and 
printed in 1587. 8"*. This author, .after 
having praftifed phyfic, became a divine and 
fchoolmafter, at Ilford^ in mfex ; where he 
died in 1607, His book, I believe, is only 
a tranflation of " Levini Lemnii Expli^ 
catio Similitudinum qua in Bibliis ex berbis 
et arboribus fumuntur.*' Lemnius, who 
was a phyfician in the province of Zealand^ 
briefly defcribes the plants of the holy Scrip- 
tures, and produces a number of curious 
philological obfervations refpedling the ufcs 
of plants in ceremonial and facred rites. 
He alfo wrote a memorable work, De Mi^ 
racuKs accultis Natura, The Angular pro- 

Plumier alfo commemorated Pena, by giving his 
name to one of his new American plants ; which, as it 
proved to be a fpecics of Polygala^ was transferred by the 
author of the fexual fyftem, to an Ethiopian plant qf the 
tetrandrous dafs, though allied in habit to the ErU^ and 
Pajferirup.

pcrty of madder In colouring red the bones

he learnt it from Mizaldus, or the latter 
from him, I know not. His book was 
among the earlieft produiftions in its way, 
and feems to have been well received, as 
may be judged by its paffing through twelve 
or thirteen editions, from its firft publica- 
tion in 1563 to 1627. 

I conceive this Thomas Newton to have 
been the writer of thofe commendatory 
lines prefixed to Lyte's Herbal-, in which, 
after complimenting the author for his ju- 
dicious feleftion of ufeful knowledge from 
former writers, he has verfijiedy in lefs than 
two pages, the names of more than two 
hundred worthies in medical Icience, from 
the earlieft antiquity to his own times*

GERARD. 

LO B E L's writings, howfoever efteem- 
ed by the learned, having never been 
tranflated into Englifh, could not become 
popular ; and, at the conclufion of the fix-Â» 
tecnth century. Turner's book was, pro- 
bably no lefs obfolete, than Lyte's wa$ 
imperfedt. Thefe circumftanccsy conlpiring 
with the growing tafte of the times for garr 
dening, it may be prefumed, incited Ge- 
rard to undertake his Herbal: a work 
which maintained its credit and efteem for 
more than a century 5 and, pleafing as it is 
to refledt on the rapid progrefs and im- 
provement of Botany, within the lall half 
century, yet there are many now living who 

can 



Gtrard. in 

can recoiled:, that when they were young in 
fcience, there was no better fource of Bota- 
nical intelligence, in the Englijh tongue, 
than the Herbals of Gerard and Park-i^ 

INSON. ' 

It has been obferved, that the early edi- 
tion of DoDOENs's book, as tranflated by 
Clusius, had been the bafis of Lyte's 
Herbal ; and, as the laft edition of the fame 
author became the foundation of Ge- 
rard's, this circumftance renders it not 
unfuitable here to take fome notice of an 
author, although a foreigner, to whom he 
owed fo much of that credit, which has 
preferved his memory to the prefcnt times. 

Rembert Dodoens, or Dodon^us, was 
born in 1 517,, near Mechlin in Flanders. 
He became confpiouous for his various -eru- 
dition when young ; was phyfician for fome 
time to the Emperor Maximilian, and his 
fon Rodolpb II. The importunity of his 
friends procured his difmifTion from thÂ« 
Emperor's fervice, and he fettled at Ant^ 
^werf ^, was- afterwards profcffor at Leyden^ 
and died in 1586. He wrote on aftronortiy, 
geography, and phyfic ; but is remembfcred 

now.

now^ principally^ by his botanical work^Â« 
His attachment to this ftudy, and the opÂ« 
portunitics he enjoyed of gratifying it, en- 
abled him to turn it to the moil advantage- 
ous purpofes. He began to publifli in 1 552', 
and continued his acceflions and improve- 
ments to the year 1583, when he collected 
all his writings, on this fubjedt, into one 
volume, under the following title, ** Stir-

coveries of the time^ added to the inftru<5tion

preceding author, rendered Dodoens's book 
iifeful to the medical profeffion throughout 
the world. It ftill prcferves fome vajuc, as 
being referred to by LiKn^us* for the 
illuftration of the European plants. 

As Gerard could not attempt an entire 
new work, there was then extant no othei^ 
to which he could give the preference^ as 
a bafis to his deÂ£gn i for as fuch only it 
mi^ft be coniidered, iince the interval oÂ£ 
time between the publication of Dodo*^ 
N-ffiUs's work in 1 583* and the printing of his

To thefe may be added, a number of 
collateral refources, which the -growing 
commerce and fpirit of the times rendered 
favourable to his purpofes. I will briefly 
mention the following: the Materia Me^

of Garcias ab Horto on the fimples 
of the Eaft Indies, ofMoNARDES on thofc 
of the Weft, and afterwards of Chrijiopher 
-a Costa's book, fatisfied, for a time, the 
-impafience of the public.

*^ of the New Founde World, from the Spa-

Garcias ab Horto into Latin, in 1567 ; 

and James Garet had alfo tranflated from 

the Spanifh the work of a CqsTA. Thefc 

books were incentives to curiofity ; and tlie 

thoufand novelties which were brought into 

England by our circumnavigators, Ra-. 

LÂ£iGH and Cavendish, in 1580 and 

1588, excited a degree of attention, which 

at this day cannot, without the aid of con- 

fiderable recoUcdlion, be eafily conceived. 

Raleigh himfelf appears to have pof- 

fefled a larger fhare. of tafte for the curious 

produdtions of nature, than was commoa 

to the feafaring adventurers of that period. 

And pofterity will rank thefe voyagers among

The returnof Ralesgh^ and the fame 
of his manifold difcoveries and coUedtions^ 
brought over from the continent the cele* 
bratcd Clusius^ then in the 55th year oÂ£ 
his age. He, wka added more to the ftock 
of Botany in his day, than all his conten^i- 
pocaries united, vifited England, for the 
third tirne,^ to partake, at this critical juncÂ« 
ture, in the general gratification. 

At this eventful period, Gerard was in 
the vigour of life, and without doubt felt 
t4ie influence, and reaped the advantage of 
all the circumftances I have enumerated. 

Jo&H Gerard was born at Nantwicb^ 
in Chejhirey in the year 1545, andwasedu- 
i^ted a furgeon. He removed to London^ 
where he obtained the patronage of the 
great Lord Burleigh y who was hinafelf a 
tover of plants, and had the beft colledioiv ' 
ift his garden of any nobleman in the king** 
dom. Gerard had the fuperintendance 
of this finie garden, and retained his em- 
ployment, as he tells us himfelf, for twenty 

yearS|| 



Qerard^ if 7 

yeafs. He li^ied in Holborriy where alfo he 
had a hs^phyjic garden of his own; which 
was probably the firft of the kind in 'Eng^ 
landy for the number and variety of its pro- 
dudlions. It (hould iecm^ that in hifi , 
younger days he had taken a voyage intd 
the Baltic, fince he mentions having feea 
the wild pines growing ai>out Narva. 

Gerard appears alfo to have been fa- 
voured by the college of phyficians, and iÂ« 
highly extolled by Pr- Bulleyn. Both' 
LoBEL, and Dr. Browne, phyfician to 
the queen, wrote, in Latin, commendatory 
letters to him, on the publication of his 
Herbal. He attained to fuch eminence ia 
his profeffion, as to be chofen mailer of the 
<:ompany. He died about the year j6pj. 

There is a half Â£heet print of Gerard 
prefixed to his own edition of the ^* Her- 
** bal," done in the 53d year of his age, and 
a fmall oval one at the bottom of a full half 
fheet frontifpiece, before Johnson'5 edi- 
tion.

This little piece, from the nature of the

We are informed, in the life of Dr. Bul- 
LEYN, that Gerard's Garden contained 
near eleven hundred forts of plants, of fo- 
reign and domeftic growth; from whence^, 
lays Mr. Oldys^ *' it may appear, that our

even turned into an approbation of Lob el's 
method; but he charges him alfo with 
Jargely plundering the Adverfaria^ vrithoat

Gerard cbmprilcs the whole vegetaWq 
Hingdom in three books. ThQ ^rji con-^ 
tains the graffes, grain, rufhes, reedsj^ Aags^

whole divided into upwards of eight hun- 
dred chapters, which, in the arrangement 
pf that time, may, if the expreflion is al-Â» 
Jowable, be confidered as fo many genera. 

In each chapter the feveral fpecies arcf

NJEMONTANUs in 1 588. In this manner/ 
Gerard, with Dodoens for his founda- 
tion, by taking in alfo many plants from 
Clusius, and from Lobel, by the addition 
of fome from his own flock, publifhed a 
volume, which, from its being well timed, 
from its comprehending almoft the whole 
of the fubjedts then known, by being writ- . 
ten in Englifh, and ornamented with a more 
numerous fet of figures than had ever ac-. 
companied any work of the kind in this 
kingdom, obtained' great repute. To this 
we muft add the fortunate circumftance of 
its acquiring afterwards fo learned an edi- 
tor as Johnson, which eftablifhed the cha-' 
radter of it, and gave it precedence as a po- 
pular book, for more than a century. And 
notwithftanding his manifeft inferiority to 
LoBEL in point of learning, it muft yet be 
owned, that Gerard contributed greatly, 
to bring forward the knowledge of plants 
in England. His connexion with the great, 
and his fituation in London j favoured an exr 
tenfive correlpondcnce, both with foreigners 
and his own countrymen ; and his fuccefs 
in procuring new exotics, as well as fcarc^ 

indigenous

and his friends the difcovery of many new 
Englifh plants ; and his name will be re- 
membered by botanifts with efteem, when 
the utility of his Herbal is fuperfeded. 
That he was confidered as pofleffing a 
very extenfive fhare of this fcience, we arc 
juftified in believing, on the teftiraony of 
Mr. G(?(!?rg-^ Baker, chief furgeon to the 
queen, who aflhres us, that he faw him

"ever came into Euglandy and was ac-

cj^HOMAS Johnson was born at Sel^ 
bjy in TorkjUrCy and bred an apothe- 
cary in London. He afterwards kept a 
fhop on SjioW'-HiIly *' where, by his un- 
** wearied pains, advanced with good natu- 
*' ral parts," fays Mr. V/ood, *' he attained 
*' to be the beft herbalift: of his age in E^g"- 
*â€¢ lafidr 

He was firft announced to the public, by 
a fmall piece under the title of ** Iter int 
AoiiUM Cantianum, 1629; et Eri- 
CETUM Hamstedianum, 1632 : whicfe 

wero 



yohnfon: iij 

Were the firft local catalogues publifhed in 
England. He foon after acquired great credit 
by his new edition and emendation of Ger- 
hard's " Herbal." 

In the civil wars, his zeal for the royal 
caufe led him into the army, in which he 
greatly diftinguiflied himfelf ; and the uni* 
verfity of Oxford^ in confideration of his 
merit and learning, added to that of his 
loyalty, conferred upon him the degree of 
dodtor of phyfic. May 9, 1643. 

In the army, he had the rank of lieute- 
naiit colonel to Sir Marmaduke Rawdon, 
governor of Bajinghoufe. Mr. Granger in* 
forms us, that ** he fet fire to the Grange^ 
*' near that fortrefs, which confifted of 
^^ twenty houfeÂ«, and killed and burnt about 
" three hundred of Sir William Wallers

** a fortnight after. At which time his 
â€¢* worth did juftly challenge funeral tears ; 
^* being then no lefs eminent in the garri- 
** fon for his valour and condufl: as a fol- 
** dier, than famous through the kingdom 
^* for his excellency as an herbalLft and 
^* phyfician." 

I have mentioned Johnfon's Iter Can^ 
tianum, and Ericetum Hamftedianum i but 
not having feen cither, I can give no ac- 
count of them. 

In .1633, he publiihed his improved edi- 
tion of Gerard, under the title of ** The 
*^ Herbal, or General History (^ 
*â€¢ Plants, gathered hy John Gerard, 
^* of London y very much enlarged and a- 
*^ mended by T^y&^z/^/w Johnson, citizen and 
^* apothecary of London^ for IHip and Nor- 
ton/' 1633. fol. 5 and again 1636. pp. 
1630. 

An interval of thirty-fix years, fronj the 
date of Gerurd's work, had effeded a great 
change in the ftate of botanical knowledge j 

.many 



^c 



faiany ni6w plants had been introdfuced, and 
many valuable works publifhed on the con- 
tinent, particularly the Hortus Eyftetten^ 
Jis in 1613J and the Prodromus of Bau- 
hine in 1620. No -publications had ap- 
peared at home, except fuch as were 
adapted to the Florift and Gardener; Gaf^ 
par Bauhine's invaluable Pinax had facili- 
tated and (hortened the labour of confulting 
preceding authors* All thefe circumftances 
were favourable to Johnson ; and his ac-^ 
knowledged fuperiority to Gerard in the 
learned languages, might juftly raife the ex- 
pectation of the public I infomuch that it 
becomes a matter of fpeculation, why John- 
son acquiefced in the charafter of an editor 
only. It may indeed^ be converted into a 
ftrong prefumption of the value fet by the 
public on Gerard; which probably pre- 
vented the rilk of a new title. 

The general expectation was not difap- 
pointed* The advantages above noted en- 
abled Johnson to amplify and improve 
his author to fuch a degree, that his book 
eminently deferves the encomium that Hal- 
Ler has beftowed Upon it, when he calls 

Vol. I. K it

it ** dignum opus^ et totius ret herbaria e$ 
'^ ievo nota^ compendium.'^ 

After what has been faid of the plan, as 
it ftands in Gerard, it remains only to 
{hew briefly what Johnson has done. In 
about twelve pages, he has prefixed a con- 
cife, candid, and judicious account of the 
moft material writers on the fubjedt, from 
the earlieft ages to the time in which he 
wrote; concluding with a particular account 
of his own work, from its origin in Dr. 
Priest's tranflation. After this follows 
a table, pointing out, with great precifion, 
all his additions i by which we learn, that 
he enriched the work with more than eight 
hundred plants not in Gerard, and up- 
wards of feven hundred figures, befides in- 
numerable correftions. By procuring the 
fame cuts that Gerard ufed, (to which 
colle<3ion a confiderable acceffion had been 
made) and by having fome new blocks cut, 
his work contained a greater number of 
figures than any Herbal extant ; the whole 
amounting to 2717. He informs us, in 
an apology he makes for not inferting his ' 
additional matter in the edition of 1636, 

that 



that he intended ito travel throughout the 
kingdom in fearch of the more rare plants, 
and afterwards to comprife all his difcove-^ 
ries in an appendixi* 

In 1634, he publilhed " MeRcurius

It is dedicated'to Sir T^heodofe M a ye r n e> 
and others of the college^ iii his own, and 
the names .of his affociates in the e^icurfion, 
who were all of the company of the Apo- 
thecaries. It was the refult of a journey, 
through Oxford, to Batb and Briftoly and 
back by Southamptony the Ifle of Wighty and 
Guildford^ made With the profefled defign 
to inveftigate rare plants. He has defcribed, 
in not inelegant Latin, their rout, which 
took up only twelve days, and the agrce-^ 
able reception they met with among their 
medical acquaintance. We meet with a 
lift of exotics, amounting to 1 17, cultivated . 
by Mr. George Gibbs, a furgeon at B^thy 
who had made a voyage to Virginia, from 
whence he brought many new plants 5 
which, as it exhibits the advanced ftate of 
K 2 gardening.

gardening in this country at that time^ ii 
now a matter of curiofity. 

The plants of fpontaneous growth enu- 
merated in this fhort tour, varieties being 
excluded, exceed fix hundred, which, at 
a time when the cryptogamia were fcarcely 
noticed, and in the feafon when neither the 
very early nor late plants could be feen, is 
no inconfiderable number. In this ca- 
talogue are feveral not difcovered in Eng^ 
land before. With this tour Johnson gave 
his fmall traft, ** De Tbermis Bathonicis^ 
Jive earum defcriptio^ vires^ utendi tempus^ 
modusy &c/' Lond. 1634. pp. 19. There 
are three fmall plans of the baths, and 
one of the city, which fcem to be copied 
from Speed's map. Thefe are now pleafing 
curiofities to the lovers of antiquity, and to 
all who contemplate the aftonifhing increafe 
of the city llnce that time. 

This was followed by " Pars a^^tera.

Johnson, if not the firft, was among 
the earlieft Botanifts who vifited Waks^ 
and Snowdon^ with the fole intention of 

difcovering 



"Johnfon, 133 

difcovering the rarjties of that country ia 
the vegetable kingdom. The journey feems 
to have anfwered his purpofe, and afford- 
ed him a rich harvcft. In this expedition 
he firft found the yellow poppy^ papaver 
cambricum : mountain faw-v^^ort, ferratula 
alpina: rofe-root, rbodiola rofea \ zxA feveral 
other plants. 

I cannot afcertain the age of Johnson 
at his death, but there isre^fon to think he 
could not be far advanced in life, if indeed 
he was arrived at the meridian of it. I 
ground my opinion on the circumftance of 
trOBEL's total filence relating to him, in 
his iAdverfaria, printed in 1605. En^ 
gaged as Johnson was, in the exercife of 
$1 profeffion, which, independent of the 
calls of duty, demands much facrifice of 
time, to the fornis and civilities of life, 
his, Herbal is an ample teftimony of zeal 
^nd induftry, I do not find that he was 
the author of any other publications, than 
thofe, of which I have given fome account} 
but, he tranflated the works of Ambrofe 
Farey, which he publifhed at London in 
J643. They were reprinted, if I miftake not, 

K 3 for 



134 CHAPTER 10, 

for the laft time in 1678. This excellent 
man, who in the charafter of furgeon, fuccef- 
lively ferved four fovereigns of FrancCy was 
attached to the proteftant caufe ; and for 
his extraordinary merit, and his having 
cured Charles IX. of a tendon wounded in 
bleeding, was faved from the maflacre of 
St. Bartholomew. He furvived this event 
19 years, and died in 1590. His works 
were collected by himfelf, in 1582, in folio, 
and ran through nine or ten editions on the 
continent. Parey*s improvements in his 
profeffion had been Angularly important; 
there can be no doubt, therefore, that our 
author performed a very acceptable fervice 
to his countrymen, by putting his writings 
into an Englifh drefs *â€¢ 

â™¦ Miller confecrated the name of Johnson by af- 
jigning it to a berry-bearing (hrub of CaroUnay belonging 
to the tetrandrous clafs 5 firft figured by Plukenet, 
tab. 136. f. 3. and fince by Catesby, vol. 2. tab. 47. 
The Englifh Botanifts, who muft confider Johnson as 
. entitled to fo honourable a diftinftion among their 
worthies, will regret that his name (bould not be re- 
tained in the Linnaean fyftem,na preference to Callicarpay 
by which term this fhrub is now well known in the 
Englilh gardens.

Before Johnson is difmifled, it would 
be unjuft not to notice Ibme of thofe, to 
whom the author was efpecially indebted 
for affiftance, and for the communication 
of Englifh plants. Among thefe, the firft 
place is due to Mr. John Goo dyer, of 
Maple Durham f in Hampjhire, whofe name 
occurs repeatedly in Gerard's ** Herbal/* 
and very frequently in Parkinson's, ia 
which he is ftiled ** a great lover and 
" curious fearcher of plants ; who, befides 
** this'* (fpeaking of the geranium faxa^ 
tile J ** hath found in our country many 
** other plants, not imagined to grow in 
" our land." He feems not only to have 
been what may be called a praSlical Bota- 
nift, but learned, and critically verfed in 
the hiftory of the fcience. This may be 
fairly inferred from his curious communi- 
cation, relating to the manufcripts under 
the name of Apuleius Madaurertfis^ and 
from his obfervations on tht faxifrage of 
the ancients, infertcd at p. 604. The great 
number of rare Englifli plants, which Mr. 
GooDYER firft brought to light, entitles 

K 4 him.

thofe who have advanced the botanical 
knowledge of this kingdom, 

Mr, George Bowles, oi Chi/Jelburfi^ in

cefsful inveftigation of many new plants. 
He fpent fome time in Wales, where his 
difcoverics were very apiple;, and he is 
inentioned with particular attention^ in 
numerous inftances, by pur author.

to me not Jo have been juftly appreciated^ 
He was bred an apothecary, and lived in 
London. He was contemporary with Ge- 
rard and LoBEL, during the latter part 
of their lives ; and furvived Johnson feve- 
ral years. Lobel, in the fecond part of his

a garden well ftored with rarities. In fadt, 
he rofe to fuch a degree.of reputation as to 
be appointed apothecary to King James i 
and at the publication of his ^* Theatre of 
** Plants/' he obtained, as we learn by Sir â€¢ 
Theodore Mayerne's commendatory letter - 
prefixed to it, the title from Charles the 
Firft of Botanicus Regius Primarius. The 
time of his death I cannot afcertain ; but, 
as his '^ Herbal" was publifhed in 1640^ 
and he appears to be living at that time, 
he muft have attained his 73d year. There 
is a print of him prefixed to his Paradifus^ 
in the 62d year of his age, and a fmall 
oval one, in the title of his ** Herbal," or 
*' Theatre of Plants." 

His firft publication was the " Para-

There was a fccond edition publifhe4 
jiter the author's death, correfted and en-r 
larged, in 1656. 

As the fubj^dt of this book interefts the 
florift and gardener merejy, it connies lefs 
within the fcppe of this work than his 
^< Herbal." Jt is dedicated Xo Queen 
'Elizabeth i and, agreeably to the panegyri- 
cal cttftom of the times^ is fct ofFwith re-r 
commendatory verfes j among which wc 
meet with fome in Latin frpm T^bomas 
Johnson, doubtlefs the editor of Gi^rard, 
and a Latin letter^ in a high ftrain of eiw 
logy, from Sir Theodore Mayerne. 

The plants are arranged without any 
other order than that exprefTed in the title 
page. Garden flowers are divided into 1 34 
chapters, according to thegenerical names of 
the time J kitchen plants into ^3 chapters i 
fruit trees and fhrubs into 24 chapters; 
and a corollary of 22 fpecics. Nearly one 
thoufand plantis are feparatelydefcribedj of 
which feven hundred and eighty are $gur- 



Parkinfotti tj(t 

ed on one hundred and nine tables, which 
appear to have been cut on purpofe for this 
work. Many are copied from Clusiits 
and LoBEL. The figures are lefs com- 
mendable for the defign than the execution, 
and arc much inferibr, on the whole, to 
thofe of Gerard's *^ Herbal/' In the 
Latin names, the author has made ufe prin* 
cipally of Cajper Bauhine ; fome are 
taken from Lo b e l . The mode of arrange- 
ment in each chapter is fimilar to that of 
Gerard. After the defcription of all the 
fpecies, follow the place, time of flowering, 
fynonyms, and virtues. Lefs is fpoken of 
the cultiire than feems to be requifite. 

Several Englifhmen had written on gar^ 
dening and agriculture in the fixteenth 
century, of whom the firft on hufbandry, 
as far as I can find, was Antony Fitzher-* 
BERT, a famous lawyer and juftice of the 
King's Bench, whofe " Booke of Huf- 
*' bandrie" was printed firft in 1534. One 
of the earlieft, if not the firft on gardening, 
is Thomas Hill, ^^ His profytable Art of 
*' Gardening," printed in 1 574. The next 
was, " The new Orchard and Garden," by 

William

142 



C H A P t E R !!â€¢ 



William Lawson, in 1597* In 1600^ Sir 
Hugh Platt, the author of many other 
ufcful trads, Â» put forth his ** Garden of 
** Eden ;" a book of great merit in its 
time. All thefe pafled through numerous 
editions, and the laft preferved credit to the 
end of the century. 

Parkinson however, as I apprehend^ 
was the firft author, who feparately defcrib- 
cd and figured the fubjedts of the Flower 
Garden. The Paradifus Terrejiris is there- 
fore, at this time, a valuable curiofity, as 
exhibiting the moft compleat view of the 
extent of the Englifh garden at the begin- 
ning of the laft century. Intertropical 
produdlions had been but fparingly import- 
ed. The real ftove plants are very rare 
throughout the book. There arc fome 
American fpecies, and particularly from 
Virginia^ as being a part of that continent 
Vfith which England had the jnoft frequent 
intercourfe. Biit the principal produdtions 
of the Englifh gardens were exotic Euro- 
pean, and Grecian plants, fome Afiatic, and 
a few from the northern coafts of Africa. 

A modern florift, wholly unacquainted 

with 



Parkinfon. 143 

with the ftate of the art at the time Par- 
kinson wrote, would perhaps be furprized 
to find that his predcceflbrs could enume- 
rate, befides fixteen defcribed as diftinft 
fpecies, one hundred and twenty varieties of 
the tulipj fixty anemoniesj niore than nine- 
ty of the narcijjus tribe, fifty hyacinths^ 
fifty carnations^ twenty pinks^y thirty cro^ 
cufesy and above forty of the iris genus. In 
the orchard we find above fixty kinds of 
plumsy as many apples and pears^ thirty 
cherries^ and more than twenty peaches. 

In 1640, Parkinson publifhed his 
.*' Theatrum BoTANicuM; or. Theatre 
^^ of Plants, or an Herbal of a large extent : 
â€¢* containing therein a more ample and ex- 
**'ad hiftory and declaration of the phyfical

** hundreds of new, rare, and ftrange

Seguier mentions an edition in i656>* 
which I never faw, and fufpedt it was not 
a new impreflion. 

This work was the labotir of Parkin-^ 
son's life, and was not publifhed until he was 
arrived at a very advanced period. He tells 
us, in the preface, that, owing " to the dif* 
â€¢* aftrous times,** and other impediment^ 
the printing of it was long retarded. Ori- 
ginally it was intended to have contained 
Only the medicinal herbs, undefr the title 
of ** A phyfical Garden of Simplfes,*' but 
he enlarged his plan, and endeavoured to 
comprehend all the Botany of his time. It 
is manifeft, even from a curfory view of it, 
that it is a work of much more originality 

than 



' Parkinfon. 145 

than that of Gejiardj and it contains 
abundantly more matter than the laft edi-. 
tion of that author, with all Johnson's 
augmentations. In the general difpofition 
of the fubjedt, the order is chiefly founded 
on the known, or fuppofed qualities, and 
virtues of the plants ; being divided into 
feventeen tribes, as follow : 

1 . Planta odor at a. Sweet-fmelling plants*

proves his attachment to the Flower Gar-* 
den, in the early part of his life ; and this 
bias influenced him throughout the " Thea- 
" tre of Plants/' As yet, no line had been 
drawn with fufficient accuracy, between 
fpecies and variety, between nature and the 
cfFed: of culture, or of foil and fituation, nor 
was this brought about till the efTential parts

ohycOis of claffification, inftead of the vague 
diftirwSions hitherto ohferved ; of which it 
may be fufficient to adduce one eicample^ 
out of hundreds equally futile. The fea 
cabbage, (braffica orientalis) ^i^liquofe plants 
is ranked by Gerard and Johnston, as 
well as by Parkinson, even contrary to 
the examples of Clusius and Dobon^u^, 
under the fame generical name with the 
thorow wax, (bupkurum) an umbelliferous 
plant, merely becaufe the leaf is of the 
perfoliate )drxd. 

Thefe are dcfedts common to the age, and 
Parkinson muft not be appreciated by 
modern improvement, but by comparifbn 
with his contemporaries. la this view, if 
I am not miftaken, he will appear more 
of an original author than, Gerard, or 
John son j independent of the advantages he 
might derive from being poflerior to them. 
His ^^ Theatre'' was carried on thro' a long 
feries of years, and he profited by the works^ 
of fome late authors, which^ though equal- 
ly in Johnson's power, he had negleded 
to ufe. Parkinson's defcriptions^ ia 
many inftances, appear to be new.. He is 

more 



Parkinfbn. 149 

iiK>re particular in pointing out the places 
of growth. In the enumeration of the 
iynonyms, he has Hot only given nearly the 
wholeof B AUH I N e's ** Pinax^'' but, very fre** 
quently, has- himfelf confulted the original 
authors, and enters minutely into a difcuf- 
lion of their doubts. In the account of the 
virtues, and ufes, Parkinson is diffufe. It 
was his profefled defign to make his work a 
Materia Medica ; and if, in him, we meet 
with the qualities of plants eftimated on 
Galenical principles, by the degrees of hot 
and cold, moift and dry, &c, it was the 
theory of the day, from which authors of 
higher eminence were not emancipated. 
He not only gives the opinions of the Greek 
end Roman phyficians, but of the Arabi- 
ans, and has tranflated from the moderns, . 
and his contemporaries, wha,tever could il- 
luftrate his fubjed, and render it as perfed: 
as the intelligence of the times would al- 
low. To this end he has extraded largely 
from Clusius's ** E:!i:otics,'' from D'A- 
cosTA, MoNARDES, and Garcias ab 
HoRTQ on the drugs and fimples of the 
Eaft and Weft Indies ; of which, at that 

L 3 time. 



150 CHAPTER II, 

time, many were newly Introduced, and 
iniperfedlly known. 

Parkinson's work is much more ex^ 
tcnfive than Johnson's, in the number of 
fubjedts defcribed, he having taken, as be* 
fore obferved, advantages which the Ema^ 
culator of Gerard negledted. Many of 
the plants of JEgypt^ from Pro/per Alpi-t 
Nus, many of the North American, or Ca-. 
nadian plants, from Cor'nutus, and fome 
from Columna's work, are introduced. 
He negleded no opportunities of procuring 
new plants from abroad. The nature of 
his profcffion did not allow him to make 
diftant or frequent excurlions in England ; 
but, by the afliftance of his correfpondents, 
and fome of Lobel's pofthumous writings, 
which he purchafed, he was enabled to en- 
large, not only the catalogue of Britifli 
plants, but to introduce many exotics be-Â» 
fore unknown. 

Johnson had defcribed about 2850 
plants, Parkinson has near 3800, Thefe 
accumulations rendered the ^^ Thea- 
i^ TRUM Botanfcum*' the moft copious 
feook on the fubjeift in the Englifli laur 

guage; 



Parkinfon. ^ 5 1 

guage; and it may be prefumed, that it 
gained equally the approbation of medical 
people, and of all thofc who were curious 
and inquifitive in this kind of knowledge. 
Bpth this work,^ and Gerard's afterwards, 
acquired confequence by the references of 
Mr. Ray, who may be faid, in the lan- 
guage of the Catalogus Oxmienfts, to have 
raifed them to clalSical eminence in En- 
glifh Botany, and preferved them from ob-* 
livion as long as his own works remain. 
Without any defign of depriving Johnson 
of his due praife, yet it is obvious, from 
the recoUedion of certain circumftances, 
that Parkinsqn laboured under difadvan- 
tages arid impediments, which probably 
tended to deprefs his work at the time, al- 
though it had undoubtedly been carrying on 
through a longer feries of years than John^ 
Jbn'Sj and was more copious in its defign. 

Johnson had the opportunity that Ge- 
rard himfelf obtained, of procuring all 
the cuts from abroad. Parkinson's, on. 
the other hand, though copied from the 
feme figures, appear to have been cut anew, 
purpofely for his work. The delay occa-r.

l^Z CHAPTER IJ, 

fioncd by this circumftance, bcfides the 
great expence, was, probably, among the 
obftacles the author complains of, which fo 
long retarded the publication of his work. 
Add to this, that the figures were after all 
inferior to the old tables, both in number 
and execution. Johnson's exgeed thofe 
of Parkinson,, by more than an hundred* 
Both thefe works ma^y be confidered as Z)/- 
gejis pf the Bofany of the age, in the Eng- 
lifh tongue 5 but it is to be feared the fame 
cenfure lies ag;aiijft them which Cafpar 
Bauhine lodged againft Dalechamp's 
hiftory, publifhedin 1588, in which he de- 
monftrated, that more than 400 plants were 
twic^ defcribed. 

Nor is it wonderful that the attenipt to 
comprehend, and difcriminate the whol^ 
vegetable kingdom, was a plan too exten- 
five for one man, efpecially in the aug- 
mented ftate in which Parkinson found 
it. The magnitude of the defign necqf- 
farily involved a multitude of errors, an4 
expofed both Gerarp and Parkinson? 
to the cenfures of malignant critics. Had 
the candour of Lobel bpea equal to his^ 

learning 



Parkin/on. 15^ 

Earning and knowledge, he had fpared 
much .of his acrimony againft thefe induf- 
trious writers, whofe laudable endeavours 
rather merited his applaufe. 

Among thofe contemporaries, whofe col- 
lateral affiftance is acknowledged by Par- 
ICINSON, Mn (or, as he is fliled in fome 
parts of the work, JDr.J William Boel 
claims particular notice. He was a native of 
the Low Countries, and had travelled into 
various parts pf Germany and Spain ; had 
been in Barbary^ refided at T'unisy and, at 
the publication of *^ the Herbal," lived at 
Lijbon. From all thefe countries he fent 
feeds of many plants before unknown in 
England. He was the correfpondent of 
Clusius, and feems to have been very 
jealous for the improvement of natural 
knowledge.

As we are now arrived at the period, 
when wooden cuts were about to be

kinson's " Herbal" being the laft of any 
importance in which they were ufed in 
England^ it may not be incongruous to our 
plan to notice the origin and progrefs of 
that art, which contributed not a little to 
facilitate the. knowledge of plants. Rude 
a$ thefe reprefentations were, compared 
with the elegance of modern times,' yet, in 
an age when fpecific diftinftions were not

pended 



156 CHAPTER 12. 

pended fo much on habit, they fpoke to 
the eye, and often difcriminated the fubjed, 
when the laboured defcription failed. 

It has been before obferved, th^it Se- 
GUiER is of opinion the firil Herbal with 
wooden cuts was the ** Puch dtr Natur^* 
*â€¢ The Book of Nature," printed at Augf^ 
burgh y in 1478, if not three years earlier. 
Thefe are thought to have pafled into the 
Herbarius, printed 2X Mentz in 1484; 
from which book was compiled the Ortus 
Sanitatis, printed at the fame place in 
1485 ; with improvements in the work in 
general, and better figures, by Cuba. Of 
this work fome notice has before been taken, 
as the foundation' of the Engliih ** Gretc 
** Herbal,'' firft printed here in I5i6, 

The HoRTus Sanitat-is was tranflated 
into various languages, and in fome new- . 
modelled, without concealing its origin, 
acicording to the fancy of different editors 
and- printers ; and pafled through innume- 
rable editions on the Continent; having 
been the popular book on the fubjeft, as 
the '^GreteHerbar was in England, for fifty 
or fixty years.

It does not appear that Cuha was pub- 
licly known as the author of the Hour us 
Sanitatis, until Eqenolf, a bookfeller 
of Frankfort, ^yc an improved edition, 
with an entirely new fet of figures, under 
the care of EuctfARius Rhodion or Ro- 
ESLiN, a phyfician of the fame city, in 
1.533. Egeno^s hook pafled through va- 
rious editions^ until a better work was com- 
pofed by DoRSTEN, under the title of ^^Bo^ 
ianicon,*^ in 1540, at Frankfort y in which 
the fame figures were employed. They 
were ufed alfo in the ^^ Encyclopeedia Mediea'* 
of J, Dryander, in 1542; and in the 
fucceeding year, in an edition of Di-osco- 
Rii>is,Syhy Hermann Ryff, printed by Â£g-^- 
nolf Finally, Adam Lonicer, the fon- 
in-law of Egenolf having totally reformed 
the work of Cuba, employed them, in his 
Herbaly printed in 1546. In fucceeding 
editions, he introduced new figures, took 
others from Tragus to the number in 
the whole of 88o> and compofed a work, 
which paflfed through a gitat number of 
editions, and f^as not fuperfeded in the 
prefent century, as appears by an edition 

printed 



158 CHAPTER J2. 

printed fo lately as in 1723, and even irt 

^737- 
We arc informed by Tragus, that Ege-^ 

nolf fpared no expence in the encourage- 
ment of artifts to procure thefe icons> rude 
and imperfedt as ^hey appear to us. He fe-** 
cured to himfelf, by this means, the mo-^ 
nopoly of printing Herbals^ for a fucceffion 
of years; an4 acquired both fame and 
riches. 

At lengthy thefe were all fuperfeded by 
thofe of Brunsfelsius to his Herbal^ 
printed in 1532 ; which were drawn from 
nature, and appear to have been the firft 
that were worthy of notice* Thefe were^ 
however, greatly excelled by Fucrisius, in 
1 542 I whofe figures, although only out- 
lines, are uncoiiimonly beautiful, and not 
lefs juft. They confift of five huiidred 
figures in folio, of the moft common and 
ufeful plants; and were copied, in a fmaller 
fcale, by many fucceeding authors. Tra- 
gus took moft of them into his ^' Hiftory 
â€¢* of German Plants," to which he added 
many new ones, to the aq|punt in all of 
567. Thofe of Tragus are little more

than outlines ; and, allowing for the time, 
they fufficicntly well exprefs the habit of 
moft of the fubjefts, 

'Egeriolf\i2iV\Vi% fet the example, printers, 
after this tirhe, themfelves bore the expence 
of cutting the blocks ; by which means, 
certain printers monopolifed the printing of 
Herbals ; and a kind of commerce between 
them and authors took place, and mutual 
exchanges were made for the ufe of each 
other's books. Among thefe, no one pof- ' 
feffed at length a greater collection than 
the famous Plantin, oi Antwerp ^v^ho 
recommended himfelf fo highly by the 
excellency of his types, and mode of exe- 
cuting his works. Hence he became the 
common printer to feveral of the celebrated 
botanic writers of the fixteenth century* 
When Clusius publiflied his French tranf- 
Jation of Dodoens, with Loe^ at Antwerp^ 
he gave figures copied from Fuchsius; 
all which Plantin bought. He afterwards- 
acquired the figures cut for Clusius's own 
works, and thofe of Lobel. Dodon-^us, 
befides fome unblocks, had the ufe of all the 
above in the ** Pemptades,'' in 1 584, which 
work contains 1300 figures. Tabern^^- 

MONTANUS 



l6a C H A P T E It 12. 

MONT ANUS obtained the ufe of this col- 
lection, namely, thofe of Fuchsius, Clu- 
sius, LoBEL, and Dodon^eus ; to which 
he added thofe of Matthiolus; info- 
much that his Herbal, printed at Frankfort in 
1588, comprehends more than two thou- 
land figures. Dalechamp, in his " Ge- 
â€¢â€¢ neral Hiftory of Plants," printed about 
the faqie time, augmented them to near 
two thoufand feven hundred. 

The fate of Gesner's excellent figures 
I can but briefly mention ; it forms a mor- 
tifying, but curious anecdote, in the literary 

' hiftory of the fcience. Of the fifteen hun- 
dred figures left by Gesner, prepared for 
his " Hiftory of Plants," at his death, in 

â€¢ ^S^S^ ^ ^^^g^ ^^^ paflTed into the ** Â£//- 
tome Matthioli^'' publifhed by CamerA- 
Rius in 1 586, which contained in the whole 
1003 figures ; and in the fame year, as alfb 
into a fecond edition in 1590, they embel- 
liihed an abridged tranflation of Mat- 
THiOLUs, printed under the name of the 
" German Herbah" In 1609, the fame 
blocks were ufed by Vffenbmh for the Her- 
bal of Castor Durantes, printed at 
Frankfort. This publication, however, 

comprehends 



- Wnoden Cuts. 161 

comprehends only 948 of thefc icons, nearly 
another hundred being introduced of very in- 
ferior merit. After this period. Camera- 
Rius the younger being dead> thefe blocks 
were purchafed by Goerlitij a bookfeller of 
Vim ; and next ferved for the ** Farnaffus 
Medicinalis illuftratus'' of Becher, printed 
at. that city in 1663; the fecond part of 
which work contains all thofe of the ^yEpi-- 
tome^' except fix figures. In 1678, they 
were taken into a German Herbal, made up 
from Matthiolus, by Bernard Ver-Â» 
2ASCHA, printed zt Bq/il i and fuch was 
the excellency of the materials and work-* 
manfhip of thefe blocks, that they were 
exhibited a fixth time in the ^* Tbeatrutn 
Botanicuniy' or Krauterbuch of Zwinger, 
being an amended edition of Verzascha, 
printed alfo 2XBaJHm 1696, with the addi- 
tion of more than one hundred new blocks, 
copied from C. Bauhine and TABERN-fls-^ 
M o N T AJ^JUS ; and finally^ into a new edition 
of the fame work, fo late as the year 1744. 

Thus did the genius and labours of Ges- 
NER add dignity and ornament to the works 
of other men, and even of fome whofe en- 
mity he had experienced during his life-time* 
.^ Vol. L M Befides

BeQdes the above mentioned^ Gesner 
left five volumes, confifling entirely of 
figures, which, after various viciilitudes, 
became the property of Trew^ of Norim^ 
berg. Senfible that vrhether we view the 
eitent of Gesner*s knowledge and learn- 
ing, or his fingular induftry, fuch muft be 
the veneration for his charafter, that any 
of his remains muft claim the attention of 
the curious, the poffeflbr gratified the pub- 
lic, by tlie pen of Dr. Schmiedel, with an 
ample fpccimen, publiftied in 1753. 

Thus far for foreigners. The rude icons 
Â©f the ** Crete Herbal," it has been ob-r 
fcrved, were evidently copied from thofe in 
the HoRTUs Sanitatis ; for that they 
were not the fame tables, appears from the 
diminiftied fize* Of the figures in Turner's- 
Hiftory, which'amount to upwards of 500; 
the greater part are thofe of Fuchsius's

Gerarp, in ^S97> and Johnson, his

the latter of thefe circumftances takes place. 
It is remarkable, that fo obvious an afliftance, 
after having been introduced by Ca/parBAV-^ 
HiNE in his ^^Phytopinaxy' fhould be want^ 
ing in the ** Pinax'' itfelf. Had Gerard 
and Parkinson retained, throughout their 
works, the exa<ft fynonyms of the authors 
from whom they transferred their plants, and 
quoted the pages, they would unqueftionably 
have rendered their writings much more 
ufeful to pofterity, and have preferved them 
from difufe and oblivion, for a much longer 
period. The fame may be obferved of Mr, 
Ray, who has totally neglected this valu- 
able improvement. So novel was the pracr- 
tice, that the authors of the Hortus Oxo- 
NiENsis thought it neceflary to apologife 
for it, and fhirfd themfelves under the au-Â» 
thority of the '' Hortus Eyftcttenfis:"

How. 169 

or no acceffion by it ; and I am not aware 
of one indigenous plant firft mentioned in 
this lifl. 

The fecond part, or alphabetical lift of 
Englifh names, is intended only to lead to 
the Latiij generical term in the firft part, * 

HOW. 

Until this period, no attempts iiad been 
made in England to feparate the indigenous 
from exotic botany. It is true. Dr. John- 
son, as before mentioned, had publiflied 
local catalogues of the plants of certain dif- 
trifts } but no one had eflayed a general lift 
or defcription of the Englifh plants alone, 
in the way of what is now called a Flora: 
a term, which, as far as I can find, was firft 
adopted by Simon Pauli, for a catalogue 
of the plants oi Denmark, publifhed in i648* 
It is to Dr. How that we owe the firft 
Sketch of a work of this kind; and, though 
he does not entitle bis book Flora, he yet 
mentions that term in his preface. 

William How was born in London in the 
year 1619, ^^^ educated at Merchant Tay- 
lors fchool. He became a commoner of 
St. John's college, Oxford, at eighteen ; he 

took 



ij^ CHAPTER 13. 

took his bachelor's degree in 1641, and 
tiiat of mafter of arts in 1 645 ^ and entered 
on the phyfical line. It does not appear 
that he ever took his doctor's diegree, though 
he was commonly called Dr, How. With 
many other fcholars of that time, he en- 
tered into the king's army, and for his loy- 
alty v/as promoted to the rank of captain, 
in a troop of horfe. Upon the decline of 
the royal caufe, he profecuted his ftudies in 
phyfic, and pradtifed in that faculty. He 
Hved firft in St, Lawrence Lane, and after- 
wards in Milk Stfe^l. He died about the 
beginning of September 1656, and was bu- 
ried by the grave of his mother, in St. Mar- 
garet's church, Wejlminjier ; leaving behind 
him, as Mr. Wood i^iys, ** a choice library 
of books of his faculty, and the char^dter of 
a noted herbalift.'* 

Dr. How's principal publication, and 
for which he is here recorded, bears the 
following title : 

<* Phytologia Britannica, natale^ 
fxUbens indigenarum Stirpium fponte enter -% 
gentium.'' Lond. 1650, i2\ pp. 133, 

The plants are arranged in the alphabe- 
tical- order of the Latin names, with one or

two fynonyms, taken, as befl: pleiafcd tho^ 
0:uthor, from various writers on the conti* 
jlent, as well as from Gerard, Parkin-t 
SON, and LoBEL, The place of growth to 
each plant is noticed, and the particular 
fpots where the rare ones grow, are fpecified. 
The lift contains 1220 plants, which (asr 
few mofles and fungi are emimerated) is ^ 
<;opious catalogue for that time, even ad- 
pnitting the varieties, which the prefent ftate 
of botany would rejed:. 

The author of this little volume was 
unqueftionably a man of very confiderablÂ© 
learning, and had a ftrong paflion for thef 
knowledge of plants ; but his jfituation in: 
life does not feem to have allowed him thd 
opportunity of travelling into the various 
parts of England, to gratify his tafte in Eng-^ 
lijh botany, with which he was not criti- 
cally and extenfively acquainted. Mr. Ray, 
in the preface to his " Catalogus Flatitarum 
AngUcdy' has given a lift of more than thirty 
fpecies in the *^ Phytologiuy' which have no 
title to a place as indigenous plants of Eng^ 
(and^ Some of thefe b^ng inhabitants of

Southern Europe; others evidently the ac*i 
cidental outcafts of gardens ; and fome, as 
certainly, miftaken for other plants, as ap- 
peared from the impoffibility of finding them 
in the fpots which How had pointed out. . 

The rare plants were almoll wholly com- 
municated by his friends,^ Mr. Stone- 
house, Dr. Bowles, Mr. Heaton, Mr. 
LoGGiNs, Mr. GooDYER, and others* 
Jle drew fome from a manufcript of Dr. 
Johnson, the editor of Gerard. I wiih 
it were in my power to commemorate thefe 
perfons in a more ample manner, who, at 
^n early period, contributed to extend and 
illuftrate Englifh botany, Mr, Stone-. 
BousR, in particular, has deferved highly 
of the lovers pf this fcience. He appear* 
to have travelled much in England^ from 
his recording the plants difcovered by him 
in many counties. In Torkjhire he was 
particularly converfant \ and, I conjedture^ 
he lived at a place called Darfield^ near 
JBarnfley^ in that county.

It has been obferved, that fome of Lo- 
bel's papers fell into the hands of Par- 
kinson, and fome into Dr. How's poflef*

great work, which How publifhed in 1 655, 
under the fubfequent title :

This work has been noticed under the

here, that the notes which the editor has

that he had publifhed the work with a view 
to take an invidious retrofped: of Par kin-

as throughout the notes, he fpeaks of PAK-f

is, happily, much lefs frequently the Ian*

TRADESCANT. 

ALTHOUGH it does not appear that 
the Tr ades cants contributed 
materially to amplify what is more efpeci- 
ally meant by English Botany, or the difco- 
very and illuftration of the plants fponta- 
neoufly growing in England : yet, in a 
work devoted to the commemoration of 
Botanifts, their name ftands too high not 
to demand an honourable notice; fince they 
contributed, at an early period, by their 

garden

garden and mufeum, to raife a curiofity fliat 
was eminently ufeful to the progrefs and 
improvement ofnaturalhiftory in gencraL 

^ohn Tradescant was by birth a 
Dutch man, as we are informed by Ai 
Wood. On what occafion, and at what 
period, he came into England, is not precife- 
ly afcertained. He is faid to have been, for 
a confiderable time, in the fervice of Lord 
Treafurer Salisbury and Lord Wooton. 
He travelled feveral years, and into various 
parts of Europe y as far eaft ward as into 
Ru^a. He was in a fleet that was fent 
againft \\\t Algerines in 1620, and mention 
is made of his collecting plants in Barbary^ 
and in the ifles of the Mediterranean. He 
is faid to have brought the trifolium Jielh^ 
turn Lin. from the ifle of Fermentera ; and 
his name frequently occurs in the fecond 
edition of Gerard by Johnson; in Par.- 
jkiinson's " Theatre of Plants," and in 
his " Garden of Flowers," printed in 1656. 
But I conjecture that Tradescant was 
not refident in England in the time of Ge- 
rard himfelf, or known to him. 

He appears however to have been efta- 

blifhed 



^ Trade/cant i 1^7; 

bliflied in England^ and his garden founded 
at Lambeth I about the year 1629 he ob- 
tained the title of gardener to Charles 1. 
Tr A DESCANT was a man of extraordinary 
curiofity, ind the firft in this country, who 
made any confiderable colle(9ion of thefub-^ 
jedts of natural hiftory* He had a fon of thc^ 
feme name, who took a voyage to Virginia^ 
from whence he returned with many new; 
plants. They were the means of introduc- 
ing a variety of curious fpecies into this 
kingdom ; feveral of which bore their name â€¢^r 
Tradefcanfs Spiderwort^ Trade/cant's After ^ 
are well known to this day; and Linn-^Us. 
has immortalized them among the Bota-* 
nifts, by making a new genus, under their 
name, of the Spiderwort, which had before 
hctn called Ephemeron. His Mufeum, calkd 
Tradefcanfs Ark, attraded the curiofity of 
the age, and was much frequented by the 
great, by whofe means it was alfo much 
enlarged, as appears by the lift of his bene-, 
fadtors, printed at the end of " his Museum 
Trades c anti a n u m ;" among whom^ 
after the names of the king and queen, are 
found thofe of many of the firft nobility.

Prefixed to this volume were the prints of

cumftance of being engraved by Hollar,. 
has rendered the book well known to the 
colledtors of prints, by whom moft of the

The influence of Aflrology in Phyfic and 
Botany, was far from being wprn out in the 
middle of this age. By the credulity and 
fuperftition of fome, and the diflionefty of 
others, it ftill maintained its ground. Se-

Ruppius, a German, in his Flora Jeneftftsy to a plant 
introduced into the EnglKh gardens by Tradbscakt

vcral phyficiahs, and other men of learning^^ 
fhewed fome bias towards it. Many prac- 
titioners of an inferior clafs, and numerous 
empirics, were ftill advocates for aftrological 
influence in the preparation and application 
ofiimples. 

There is an Herbal written by Robert 
Turner, who calls himfelf Botanologicr-

ftands timinently forward. His ** Herbal,*' 
firft printed in 1652, which c ontinued for 
more than a century, to be the manual of

and, to do the author juftice, his defcriptions

him whilft a young man, is of fo Angular at 
complexion, as to merit notice in a work 
of this kind, were it only to regret the mif- 
application of talents, which demonftrate 
an extenfivc knowledge, of books, a won- 
derful induftry in the coUeftion of his ma-

it may not be cafy to diredt them to a more

the place of growth, the tinac of flowering,

The order of Salmon's book is alphabet 
tical, and, as it is a work of mere compiIa-Â» 
tiofi, he profeffcs to have confultcd all the 
botanical authors of repute, and^numeratca 
the names of fuch. His defign was to treat 
on medicinal herbs principally. As a bo- 
tanical work it is beneath all criticifm ; the 
errors in this way being enormous, both in 
multitude and degree. In detailing the 
powers of fimples, he follows the Galenic 
terms of exprefRon ufed by the writers of 
the preceding century, and diftributes, with 
ft lavifli hand, extraordinary and numerous 
powers to almoft every herb he defcribes^ 
Exclufive of his induftry, fome merit is due 
to Salmon fox the regular arrangement of 

his

his fubjed's, fubordinate to his method^ 
qualities which, under the diredion of 
more Ikill in Botany, and a founder judge- 
nient in difcriminating the properties of 
iimples, might have enabled him to have

RAY. 

IF we here take a retrofpeftive view of 
the progrefs of botany during the firft* 
period bf the feventeenth century, we 'find 
that, however particular individuals, both 
in England and on the continent, might 
have laboured in its advancement, it was- 
riot, on the whole, in a flourifhing ftate, 
either here, or in any other part of Europei 
From the time of the Bauhines, even 
to that of Ray, its progrefs as a fcience- 
was flow. The Remains of John Baip- 
HINE, his ** Hijloria Plantar um Vniver-^'

folio volumes, at the expence of 40,000 
florii^s, defrayed by F. L. a Graffenreid, 
was the principal performance on the con- 
tinent, and that indeed was invaluable. It 
is a monument of learning and induftry, of 
which few examples can be expected in any 
one age. That which Ge s n e r performed 
for zoology^ John Bauhine cffedled in 
botany. It is, in reality, a repofitory of all 
that was valuable in the ancients, in his 
immediate predeceflbrs, and in the difcove- 
ries of his own time, relating to the hiftory 
of vegetables, and is executed with that 
accuracy and critical judgment which can 
only be exhibited by fuperior talents. 

ThÂ« o|>ftacles to the improvement of 
botany were various. Europe had been in- 
volved in war, the perpetual enemy to free 
intercourfe among the learned; and to 
commerce, which is ever friendly to natural 
fcience. Simples were negleded in phyfic, 
for medicines drawn from chymiftry, Evca 
alchjrmy yet employed the induftry of many 
in every nation of Europe. Botanical gar- 
dens, although feveral, both public and pri- 
vate, had been eftabliihed, did not, however, 

flourifh. 



Hqurifli* The Indies had not yet poured \m 
their trcafures with that liberal hand which 
was foon after experienced. Even the paf- 
fion of the florift for varieties afGfted in 
depreiJing the genuine fpirit of the bota- 
nift. But the time was now approaching, 
when botany was about to receive a capi- 
tal advantage and embellifhment, by the 
introduction a^nd eftablifhment of ^Jiem ; 
of the rife and progrefs of which, it wiH 
not be incongruous to my plan to give a 
Chort account, fince this great revolution 
formed a new aera in the hiftory of the 
fciencq. As the revival of it, ho^yever, did 
Â»ot take place till the time of Mr. Ray 
and Dr. Mohison, I will poftpone what 
l have to fay on this fubjedt, till I have 
given fome account of the writings of thofc 
juftly celebrated naturalifts, by whofe k- 
hours fyftem itfelf was rcftored and inx^ 
proved. 

The earlieft anecdotes of Mc Ray, to 
which I can refer, are fome brief outlines of 
his life, in the ** Compleat Hiftqry of Eu* 
** rope for the year 1705.' â€¢ A more con- 
ije<iiked account of this learned and excellent 
man may be fcen in the *^ General Di<3:io-

but the inoft detailed relation is that of 
Dr. Scott, publiihed in 1760, from ma- 
terials coUedted by Dr. Derham. This 
is well abridged in the Biographical DiStio-^ 
nar^. It is much to be regretted, that our 
Guriofity has not been more amply grati- 
fied than by thefe Ihort and imperfed: me- 
moirs. 

A more circumftantial narrative of the life 
of Mr. Ray would, even at this diftance of 
time, be a valuable acceflion to biography, 
and highly grateful to thofe> who are fenfible 
of the great improvements which he gave 
to the fcience of natural hiftory in general ; 
nor could fufficicnt juftice be done to his 
manifold talents, difcoveries, and writings,, 
but by a pen of the firft eminence in bio-Â» 
graphical literature. 

The limits of my plan will not allow of 
more than a general detail of ^ the principal 
events of his life, as connected in chrono- 
logical order with his writings. 

John JVray, or, as he always fpelt his name 
after the year 1669, Ray, was born 2it Biack 
Not/e^y'iitzt Braintrecj in EJ/ixy Nov. 29, 



: ^ay. 193 

1628. His father, though in fo humble a 
{itixntioti as that of a blackfmith, fent his 
fon ta the grammar-fchool zt Braintree ; 
and in 1 644, entered him at Catherine Hall> 
in Cambridge I from whence he removed, 
in lefs than two years, to Trinity College, 
where the politer fciences were more culti- 
vated. Dr. Barrow was his fellow pupil, 
and intimate friend, and, on account of 
their early proficiencies, both were the fa- 
vourites of their learned tutor. Dr. Du- 
PORT. He was chofen minor-fellow of 
Trinity, in 1649; ii^ 1651, was made Greek*" 
ledlurer of the college; in 1653, mathe- 
matical lefturer; and in 1655, humanity 
reader. Thefe appointments were fufficient 
teftimonies of his talents and abilities at 
this early period. He afterwards pafled 
through the offices of the college, and be- 
came tutor to many gentlemen of honour- 
able birth and attainments, who gave him 
due praife and acknowledgments for his 
watchful care of them. He alfo diftin- 
guiflied himfelf, while in college, srs a fen- 
.fible and rational preacher, and a found 
divine. As his favourite ftudy was the 
Vol. I. O works 



194 CHAPTER 15, 

works of God, he laid, at this time, Â£a 
his college ledures, the foundation ^ his 
'â€¢ Wifdom of God in the Creation,"* and 
of his " Three Phyfico-theological Dif- 
** courfes /' which were afterwards fo well 
received by the public. 

At the period when Mr. Ray turned hit 
attention to the ftudy of nature, the know- 
ledge of plants was not highly fuperior to 
thb ftate in which Turner had found it, 
in the fame place, more than a centary be- 
fore. In this ftudy Ray could find no 
matter. I am not able to fay, that a fingle 
publication, of a fcientific nature, on the 
fubjeft of plants, had ever appeared at Cam^ 
bridge i for Mapkt\ '' Green Foreft /' will 
fcarcely be thought worthy of that appella- 
tion. Oxford had, indeed, not only experi- 
enced the benefit of private encouragement, 
but of public munificence, in the eftablifh- 
ihent of a Garden, fiut at the filler umÂ«^ 
verfity Mr. Ray ftood alone, himfclf indeed 
anhoft! Self-taught as he was, and fiiH 
of Ardour, he fo forcibly difplayed the uti*- 
lity of botanical knowledge, and its inti*- 
mate connection with the arts, and convex 

iiiences

irhis little volunje contains all the plants 
which the author had obferved fpontane- 
oufly growing in the neighbourhood of 
Cambridgey amounting to 626, all varieties 
and dubious plants excluded. The num- 
ber is fmall, when compared with many 
jBodorn catalogues 5 but not fo, when it is 
recQlkded, that, at that period> a very few 
of the Cnyptogamia clafs, and not many of 
^ O 2 ' the 



196 CHAPTER 15* 

the Graminaceous tribe, had been invefti*^ 
gated. 

The plants are difpofed in the alphabeti- 
cal order of the Latin names; and the fyno-* 
nyms of the four principal authors then in 
ufe given at length. Thefe are Gerard 
and Parkinson, and the two Bauhines; 
nor are others wanting, when charadtcriftic 
of the plant. Prefixed is a lift of the au* 
thors, fo accurately and inftrudlively drawn 
up, as not to have loft its utility to this 
day. Mr. Ray has interfperfed many fe^ 
IeÂ£t obfervations, on the medicinal and ceca*- 
tiomical ufcs of the plants ; on the ftruc* 
ture of the flower ; on varieties : and has 
not only defcribed fome new plants, diico* 
vered by himfelf, but given accurate dif- 
tinftions of many, before imperfcdlly known. 
Subjoined, the reader finds an index of the 
Englijh names, preceding the Latin ; an in* 
dex, fpecifying the particular places of the 
more rare plants ; then, a copious etymo* 
logy of the names, and an explanation of 
the terms ufed in the fcience. In fine, he 
has done every thing to facilitate the labour 

of 



Ray^ ' 197 

Â©f the ftudent in this part, as in the for- 
mer to inftrudt and entertain the more 
erudite reader, â€¢ 

I have been the more diffufe on this fmall 
volume, as the author has obferved nearly 
the fame plan, in his fubfequent catalogues,; 
and Synopsis* Moles parva^ Vis magna^ 
When the time in v^hich this publication 
was made, and the meagre ftrudure of pre- 
ceding catalogues isconfidered, I may fafely 
appeal to modern judges, whether this was 
not an extraordinary production. Few lo- 
cal catalogues had been publiflied at home>? 
and, I believe, not one abroad, that dif- 
played any thing like a comparable ihare of 
fcience and erudition, fo aptly united. 

Among the variety of notes in this cata- 
logue, jthere is one, poffibly not of public 
notoriety. â€¢ Mr. Ray informs us, that the 
people oi Norwich had long excelled in the 
culture and produdion of fine flowers; and 
that in thofe days, the florifts held their 
annual feafts, and crowned the befl flower 
with a premium, as at prefent. 

There can be no doubt that this volume 
met with the moH favourable reception 

O 3 from 



198 CHAPTER 15. 

from the learned in this way ^ that it prd- 
moted the ftudy of plants ; and, by railing 
the reputation of its author, encouraged 
him to profecute his ftudies with vigouri 

â€¢ Thefe occupations, however, did not di- 
vert Mr, Ray from his objeA of entering 
into the miniftry. He was, in Dec. 1 660^ 
ordiined both deacon and prieft, by Dr. 
Sanderjon, bilhop of Lincoln^ and conti- 
nued fellow of Trinity College tijl the Bar- 
tholomew aft; which, as he did not fub^j^ 
fcribe, neceffarily fuperfeded him. This 
event took place Sept. 18, 1662. 

The defirc Mr. Ray had to extend his 
knowledge of Englijh botany, had induced 
him, in the autumn of 1 658, to take a jour- 
ney, which he performed alone, through the 
midland counties of England^ and the nor- 
thern part of Wales^ in fearch of plants. 
This tour held him from Auguft 9, to 
September 18. Of this, and of two other 
tours, Mr. Ray preferved fome (hort Aie- 
morandums, in which he has noticed his daily 
progrefs, fome remarkable fads that occur- 
red, fome obferVations on the antiquities 
that he met with, and fome of the rare 

plants.

plwts. Dr. Scott has publiflied thefe 
ItimrarieSy with his life. 

Xn his fubfequent journies, he was com* 
tnonly accompanied by fome friends of a 
congenial tafte; tljus, in his fecond tour, 
in the autumn of 1661, Mr, Wij-lughby, 
and fome other gentlemen, travelled with 
Mr. Ray into Scotland^ through the coun- 
ties oi Durham zxANorthumberland^ to Eidin^ 
burgbyGlafgaWy and back through Cumber^ 
itmd ^Xid Wejimorland. This journey held fix 
weeks, from July 26, to Auguft 30. fa 
1662, Mr. Ray, accompanied by Mr^ 
WiLLUGHBY, took his third and mofteX'^ 
tenfive Englijh tour ; .through the middle 
counties of England^ into Chejhire; thence 
into North Wales, and through the. middle 
Wekh counties, into Fembrokejhirey coafting 
the fouthern part, to Bath zndBri/lo/-, thence 
to the Land's End, thiv)ugh Somerjet and De^ 
von } returning through Dorfetjhire, Wilt^ 
fidre, and iJampfliirg. They were abfent ia 
this excurfioQ, from May 8, to July 18; 
and Mr. Ray gathered a pl^tiful harveft, 
which afterwards enabled him to enrich his^ 
general *Â« Catalogue of Englifh Plants,'*

then in meditation ; nor did he omit to ava4 
himfclf of every opportunity, particularly 
at Tenby y in Wales ^ gnd in Cornwall^ of de-- 
fcribing fuch birds and fiflies as were Icfe 
frequent in other parts, preparatory to his 
intended publications in the zoological 
way* 

In 1663 he publifhed an Appendix to the 
** Cambridge Catalogue,'* containing emen^ 
dations, and the addition of forty-two 
plants. And in 1685^ came out another 
Appendix^ with the addition of fixty more> 
not noticed before; which were principally 
communicated by Mr. Dent, oi Cambridge. 
Thefe little trads are become very icarceÂ« 
Thofe who are curious to fee what thefe 
additional plants were, may find them dif- 
tinguifhed from the others in Profeflbt 
Martyn's ** Planta CantabrigienfesJ' 

Being now at liberty from the conftraints 
and bufinefs of a college life, he was led to 
accompany Mr. Willughby, Mr. Skip- 
PON, and Mr. Nathaniel Bacon, two of 
them his pupils, to the continent. Mn 
Ray was abfent from April 18, 1663, to 
March 1665-6; during which time^ they 

viiited 



IRay. act 

vifited France^ Holland^ Germany j Switzer^ 
land, Italy ; and extended their journey to ' 
Sicily and to Malta. The fruit of this ex- 
pedition will afterwards appear. 

On his return from the continent, he 
fpent the fummer of 1666 between his 
friends in EJfex and Sujfex, and in reading 
the publications which had appeared in 
England during the three years of his ab- 
fence. The winter pafled in reviewing and 
arranging the muieum of his friend and pu- 
pil, Mr. Will UGH BY, rich in animal and 
foffil produdlions ; in arranging his own 
catalogues for his general lift of Englijb 
vegetables ; and in framing the tables for 
Dr. WiLKiNs's ^*Rcal, or Univerfal Cha-^ 
rafter." 

In the fummer of 1667, Mr. Ray, ac- 
companied by his much-honoured friend, 
Mr. WiLLUGHBY, made his fourth excur- 
fion into the diftant counties* They left 
Middleton Park on June 25, and took their 
route to the Land's End, through the coun- 
ties of Worcejler, Gloucefter^ and Somerfet 5 
and returned through Hants to London on 
September 13. In this journey, befides the

I pointed objects of their purfuit, they took 
notes on the mines^ and fmelting^ and on 
the method of making fait ; and Mr. Ray 
did not omit to make, as he had done be- 
fbre^ ample additions for his colledions of 
proverbs and of local Englijh words. 

On Nov. 7, of this year, he was chofen 
lellow of the Royal Society, and was pre-* 
vailed on by Bifliop Wilkins to tranflate 
his^^ Real Charaaer" into Latin. This 
he performed, though i! was never pub^ 
Jifhed ; and the manufcript is extant in the 
library of the Royal Society. The latter 
end of the year, and the begirvning of 166 8, 
he fpent with gentlemen who had all been 
his pupils at Trinity ; Mr. Burrel, and Mr. 
CouRTHOPE, at Danny, in Su^ex; Sir Ro^ 
bert Barnham, at BoÂ£lon, in Kent} and 
Vrith Mr. Willughby, in Warwkkjhire. 
In the autumn of this year, he took his 
fifth journey, alone, into Torkjhire and Wefi^ 
morland, returning in September to Middle^ 
tan Hall} and fpent the winter with Mr. 
Willughby, then lately married*

RAY. 

ABOUT this time t)r. Tonge, Dr. 
Beal> and feme other philofophical 
gentlemen, in England, were bufied in ex- 
periments relating to the motion of the fap 
ill trees. Among thefe alfo; in the fpring 
of 1669, Mr. Ray and Mr. Willughby 
entered upon a fet of the like experiments, 
ind induced Mr. (afterwards Dr.)LisTER,to 
prcfecute the fame. Thefe experiments were 
made on the birch, the fycamorc or greater 
maple, the alder, the afli, the hafel, chefnut. 
Walnut, and willow i of which the two firft 

were 



a04 CHAPTER 1 6. 

were found to be the beft adapted to the 
purpofc, from their bleeding moft freely. 

The experiments of Mr. Ray and Mr. 
WiLLUGHBT, which were printed in the 
fourth volume of the Philofophkql I'ranJ^ 
aSions^ proved the afcent; and defcent, as 
well as the lateral courfe^ of the fap ; hut 
thefe gentlemen declined giving any deci- 
five opinion, as to a real circulation up- 
wards by the veflels of the wood, and 
downwards by thofe between the wood 
and the bark; which was the dodrine main- 
tained foon after this time by Grew and 
Malphigi, and indeed afterwards adopt- 
ed by Mr. Ray himfelf. 

This dodtrine of the circulation of the 
fap, I need fcarcely remark, gave way to 
the experiments of Dr. Hales and others ; 
which teaches, that the fap rifes and falls, 
in the fame fyftem of veffels, as it is aifefted 
by the joint operations of air and warmth* 
Yet there have not been wanting ingenious 
men of late years, alfo, who, conceiving the 
analogy between animals and vegetables to 
be greater than is ufually imagined, and 
?ven that plants not only live, but feel, have 

advanced 



advanced it as ftill probable, that tbcre is a 
real circulation of the juices ; tl^tjiiccus com^ 
munis rifing from the roots, and t\iQ fuccus 
froprius defcending towards them. Whe- 
ther thefe phyfiologies will yield to xhtpro^ 
iepjis plant arum of the Linn jean fchool, 
time nluft evihce. 

When Mr. Ray was at Cheftery in 1669, 
he availed himfelf of an opportunity of 
viewing a young porpefs, and of attend- 
ing the difledtion of it. Of the anato- 
mical ftrudture of this animal, he com* 
municated a circumftantial account to the 
R. S, in 1671 ; and it was printed in the 
Fhilofophical TranfaSfions, N*" 74 and 76* ^ 

IiY 1671, Mr. Ray wrote a paper, print- 
ed in the 'Fhilofophical TranfaSliom, NÂ» 74, 
on the fubjedl of " Spontaneous Genera- 
** tion," a point of philofophy which had 
been much difcuffed, and to which fome 
among the learned were yet attached. It 
appears from this paper, that he very early 
rejefted this doctrine, and was confirmed in 
bis opinion by the experiments of Red i.

tion I and in this volume, thefe claiTcs do 
not far exceed the number regiftered in the 
Cambridge Catalogue. The whole number 
of plants in this lift, amount to about 1050 
only. This fmall number had been owing 
to the extreme caution of Mr, Ray, not to 
admit any varieties to hold the place of 
fpccies ; and to exclude all others on doubt- 
ful authority. How, in his ^^ Fhytologiay' haÂ« 
upwards of 1200 ; and Merrett, in his 
^^FinaXy' upwards of 1400 ; certain proofs 
that the authors had not fufficiently ftudied 
the nicer diftindions, which guided the 
judgment of Mn Ray ; and as a proof, it 
may be obferved, that many of their plants 
are to this day undifcovered. Senfible as 
Mr. Ray was of the errors of Merrett^s 
^* Pinaxy' he purpofely omitted quoting it, 
as he writes to Dr.XisxER, that he might 
avoid that cenfure of it, which could not 
properly have been withheld, had he given 
his impartial opinion of that performance* 

In this year, he informs Dr. Lister, 
that he had, what he thought, a moft libe> 
ral oflfer, of one hundred pounds a year, and 

all 



-ZOS CHAPTER l6. 

all his expences defrayed, to accompany three 
young gentlemen abroad. But he declined 
it, although he much wiflied to have taken 
a review of Jthe alpine plants. Indifpofi^ 
tion had fome (hare in this refufal, and we 
find that in the next fpring, 1 671, he fuf- 
fered much from a jaundice. He was fo 
far recovered, however, before Jufy, as to be 
able to fet off on his fixth journey, in which 
he took with him Tbomas Willisel, an 
unlettered man, but one, whofe love for 
plants, and his zeal and afliduity in colled:- 
ing them, merits commemoration. They 
travelled through Derbyjhire^ Torkjhire, and 
all the northern counties, as far as to Ber^ 
wick, and back through the bifhoprick of 
Durham* 

In the fam6 year died, to the unfpeakable 
lofs and grief of Mr. Ray, his moft valua- 
ble friend Frj//w Willughby, Efq; on 
July 3d, in the 37th year of his age. The 
Jftrideft intimacy had fubfifted between 
them, from the time of their being fellow 
collegians -, and it was cemented by a cpn- 
geniality of tafte, which not unfrequently 
forms a ftronger bond of union, than the

tics of blood. Mr. Willughby had im- 
bibed, very early, a ftrong tafte for the 
ftudy of the animal kingdom, and had made 
extraordinary colledtions for compleating 
the ** -Hiftory of Birds and Fiflies;" in 
which he had ever been aflifted by his 
friend Mr. Ray ; who experienced his 
high attachment and confidence, in being 
left one of his executors, and charged with 
the education of his two fons, the eldeft of 
whom, was not four years of age.* To this 
care he liberally annexed an annuity of fixty 
ppunds per annum for life, which was ever 
regularly paid. 

immediately after this melancholy event, 
he defifted from journeying again into the 
weftern counties, as he had intended^ and 
refufed an invitation from Dr. Lister, .to 
live with him at Tork-y in order to give 
himfelf up to the faithful difcharge of his 
truft. 

For the ufe of thcfe young gentlemen, 
Mr. Ray drew up, in 1672, his Nomen* 
clator ClaJJicus^ induced thereto by obferv- 
ing the multitude of errors in the names 
of plants and animals, in the manuals of 
daily ufe. This compilation had authority

enough to recommend itfelf to fubfequent 
writers of diÂ£ti(maries and lexicons^ and has 
been reprinted feveral times. 

On November 19th, 1672, he fuftained, 
in the death of Bifhop Wilkins, the lojfe 
of another of his bcft friends. For this 
candid) ingenious, and learn.ed man, he had 
a fincere eftecm and veneration. 

In the lot of human life, fuch chafins 
are not eafily filled up after the age of forty- 
five. It is however not unreafonable to con- 
jcdure, that thefc privations added ftrength 
to his motives for domeftic retirement^ and 
accelerated at leaft, that connexion he 
made the next year, when he married Mar- 
garet Ae daughter of Mr. John Oakely^ of 
Launton, in Oxford/hire. They were mar- 
ried in the church of Middleton, on June 
the 5th, 1673. 

In the fame year Mr. Ray gave to the 
public the fruit of his foreign travels, under 
the title of, " Obfervations, topographical, 
moral, and phyfiological, made in a jour- 
ney through part of the Low Countries, 
Germany^ Italy^ and France^* London^

three aflbciatcs in this tour, was, the en- 
largement of his knowledge in natural his- 
tory, and particularly in the vegetable king- 
dom ; and the great number of plants ob- 
ferved and coUeded by him, exceeded, as 
he informs us, his expeftation : not that 
any opportunities efcaped him of defcribing 
the birds and fiflies of the feveral countries 
they pailed through, in aid of Mr. WiL- 
lughby's plans. His notes concerning 
thofe of Germany y were unfortunately lofL 
The volume before us, however, is by no 
means confined to natural hiftory. Mr. 
Ray treats on the manners of the people, 
and expatiates often on the excellencies and 
defers of the feveral governments, particu- 
larly of the cities on the continent, and on 
the ftate of the academies and univeriities. 
He does not omit to notice the antiquities 
that occurred and of thofe at Romey he gives, 
a very methodical account. Befides many 
mifcdlaneous remarks on various other 
parts of natural hiftory, he has taken occa- 
fion to make a digreffion, which, at that 
time, muft have been of a very interefting 
nature, on the moft iÂ«markable places,

where petrified ihells and figured fofHh 
are found, both in England and elfewherc ; 
and on the various opinions of authors, re- 
lating to the origin of thefe bodies. He 
freely declares his fentiments, that they are 
the remains of once-organized bodies, in 
oppofition to thofe who imagined them to 
be the produd: of what they called a plafttc 
power. He afterwards confirms his pofi- 
tions, by additional arguments recited in 
a letter to Dr. Robinson. See Letters^ 
p. 165. 

In the courfe of their journey, he every 
where notices thofe plants that are not na- 
tives of England^ and gives copious cata- 
logues of them. They fpent in the whole, 
iix months at Geneva^ which gave Mr, 
Ray an opportunity of informing himfelf 
largely, relating to the plants of Switzer^ 
landy particularly thofe of Mount Sa^ 
leve^ the Doky and of Mount Jura. He 
even difcovered fome that were unknown 
to the preceding botanifts, although thefe 
were the regions of Gesner, and the

to the Botany of that country, and gives 
the ftrongeft teftimony of his fkill, fidelity, 
and judgment, in difcriminating, defcribing, 
and extricating the plants of that fruitful 
region. 

To the end of thefe ** Obfervations,'' is

TH E talents of Mr. Ray were not 
confined to natural hiftory. He had 
a relifli, among other departments of litera- 
ture, for philological enquiries, and the ge- 
nius of tjie Englijh language had engaged 
much of his attention. Of his purfuits in 
this way, he has left memorials, which 
have extended his reputation beyond the 
jfphere of natural hiftory, and made him 
known to the learned world in general.

They were an oral and traditionary kind of 
dida(flics, which bore a greater value before 
the difFufion of knowledge by the ufe of 
printing j and, in oriental countries, are ilill 
a favourite and ufual mode of inftrudion* 

Of fuch as have been handed down in 
Britain^ from father to fon, through nu- 
merous generations, Mr. Ray's colledion 
contains an ample ftore. . It is, I believe, 
the principal in it's way; and the author has 
interfperfed many notes, which illuftratc 
the origin and fenfe of thefe aphoriftic lef- 
fons, and throw no fmall light on the 
manners and cuftoms of various people. 

In 1674, was publiflied, his " Collec-

tion, he tells us, it was undertaken, and who 
contributed largely to augment it. In the 
firft edition was a catalogue of the Englijb 
birds and fifties ; but this 'was omitted in a 
fubfequent improved and enlarged edition^ 
in 1 69 1, Mr. Ray having then projed:ed 
his *' Synopfis Animaliumy 

This is one of thofe philological collec- 
tions, which tends to amufe and gratify gene-, 
ral curiofity, is of ufe, not only to ftrangers 
and thofe who travel, but to thofe who ft^ 
much at home ; while it contributes to en- 
large the extent, and illuftrate the conftruc- 
tion of the Englijh tongue. Mr. Tborejby^ 
of Leeds J fent to Mr. Ray^ a large addition 
to this lift in the year 1703, which was 
printed in his ** Philofophical Letters," by 
Dr. Derham. 

In 1675, he communicated to the Royal 
Society fome experiments, made, I believe, by 
Mr. Will UGH BY, accompanied with his 
own obfervations, tending to afcertain the 
true ufe of the air-bladder in fifhes. They 
are fuch as the prefent phyfiology of fifhes 
have confirmed; and were printed in the 
Philofophical Tranfadions, N** 115.

In the year 1677, his '5 Catalogue of 
*^ Englift) plants" being out of print, he 
gave another edition^ augmented with new

Mr. Ray continued^ after his marriage^ to 
refide at Middleton Hall^ where his engage-* 
ments at this period of his life, were fach 
as called forth all the talents of his lit^raiy 
abilities^ and demanded all his care as Â« 
faithful guardian. He was employed in a 
double duty, that of his trufl to the fons of 
his late eftimable friend, and of editor to 
the remains of their father, *^ On the Hif- 
^' tory of Birds and Fiflics." The Ornitbo^ 
logy was firil publifhed, to which, as it 
confifted of loofe papers, written in Latin, 
and in an undigefted ftate, Mr. Ray gave 
method, and fupplied, from his own obfer- 
vations, a large fbare of valuable materials^ 
It was publifhed under the following title ;

Mr^ Ray tranflated this work into Eng^ 
Ijfhy and publifhed it, with large additions, 
in 1678, with figures engraved at the ex- 
pence of Mrs. WiLLUGHBY. The exe- 
cution of the figures was wholly inadequate 
to the merit of the work, Thefe occupa- 
tions, however, did not prevent him fronÂ» 
renewing a correfpondence with Mr. Olw 
PENBURGH, fecretary of the Royal Society^ 
a learned German, who, after h?tving re- 
fided fome time at Oxford^ had been chofen 
into that office at the firft eftablifhment of 
the fociety. Mr, Ray, in the year 1674^ 
was induced to engage, at the rcqueft of 
the fociety, with other diftant members, to 
furnifti obfervations on the fubjeds of na^ 
tural hiftory, to be read at their meetings ; 
the fociety notwithftanding the extreme di- 
ligence of the fecrctaiyi and fbmc few 

Others* 



220 CHAPTER I7. 

Others, being, at this junfturc, rather in a 
languiftiing ftate. 

On this occafion he wrote fevcral papers, 
of which fomc were afterwards printed in 
tht PbilofopbicalTranfa6Hons. Among thofe, 
which were not publiflied, as we find by 
his letters, were the following. " On the 
Acid of Ants : On a Foflil of the figured 
Kind, found in Malta^ and known by the 
name of St. FauVs Bajioons Letters^ p. 
1 20 : On the Trocbites : On Muihrooms : 
On the Darting of Spiders : On the Seeds of 
Plants; and on the fpecific Differences of 
Plants." 

On the death of the mother of his friend, 
the- Dowager Lady Willughby, and 
the removal of his fons from under Mr. 
Ray's tuition, he retired, fome time in the 
year 1676, to Sutton Cofield^ about four 
miles diftant from Middkton HalU where 
he remained till Michaelmas 1677. He 
then made a fecdnd xtxnovT^^loFalkbome 
Hally near Black Notley ; at which laft 
place he built a houfe, and finally fettled 
June 24, 1679.

yet unpubliflied, Mr. Ray, in 1684, ar- 
ranged the materials, which had been left 
in a very imperfedl and indigefted ftate. 
Perhaps no one but Mr. Ray could have 
fulfilled this poithumous office; certainly 
no man fo efFedtually, lince Mr. Ray had 
not only himfelf entirely furnifhed Mr. 
WiLLUGHBY with many, but even, the 
remainder had chiefly been collected during 
their almoft daily intercourfe, and whilft 
travelling together. 

He wrote the two firft books himfelf; 
rcvifed, methodifed, and enlarged the whole; 
and fent it to the Royal Society ; the meni- 
bers of which contributed to furnifli the

MR. Ray being fettled at Black NaU 
ley, and delivered from that anxiet/ 
which had attended him fince Mr. Wil- 
juughby's death, refumed with great vigour 
his wonted ftudy of plants; and, having al- 
ready acquired a reputation that juflified any 
expectation his friends might have formed^ 
he, in compliance with their wiflies, at* 
tached himfelf ferioufly to write " A Gene- 
" ral Hiftory of Plants/' 

Preparatory to this great work, which he 
intended to arrange fyftematically, he put 
forth, in 1682, his " Methodus Plan- 
TARUM,*' enlarged, and improved, from the 

fynoptical 



Ray. 223 

iynoptical tables, which he had printed ia 
Bifliop WiLKiNs's " Real Charadcr/* in 
1668. It bears the following title :

pp. 166. 

LiNNAUSy on what authority I know 
not, naentions an edition of this work, with 
the date of 1665, totally feparate from that 
of 1682 ; but as that is earlier than Bifhop 
WiLKiNs's Table, it is probably a mif- 
take. 

The firft principle of Mr. Ray, In this 
work, is to preferve all plants together, as 
far as poffible, in the natural charaders, 
arifing from conformity in the frudtifica- 
tion, and in the general habit. Hence arofe^ 
with him, in common as with others, too 
great a negleft of the flower, and too much 
attention to the leaves. He adheres to the 
ancient divifion of the vegetable kingdom, 
jlnto trees, fhrubs, and herbaceous plants 5 

ranking. 



a24 CHAP T.E R l8. 

ranking, however, with the latter, fuch as 
had been called Suffrutices^ or fhrubby. 
Trees he divides into nine claffes, account- 
ing the laft anomalous ; Shrubs into fix ; 
and Herbs into forty-feven. 

In the progrefs of his improvements after- 
wards, he reduced thefe claffes to thirty- 
three. His method, which is indeed. ex- 
tremely elaborate, will beft be feen by a 
view of the claffes. It will, however, be 
but juftice to refer the account to the laft 
edition, that it may appear in the greateft 
perfedion which he gave it. 
- To this book Mr. Ray has fubjoined a 
clear, concife view, and a fynoptical table, 
of the iyftem of C-ffi:sALPmE, and gives 
his reafons for not adopting it ; although 
he candidly confeffes his obligations to the 
author, whom he acknowledges to be the 
parent of fyftem. 

In 1683 and 1684, Mr. Ray and Dr. 
Tancred Robinson exchanged feveral let- 
ters, while the latter was on a foreign tour, 
relating to various undetermined fads in 
natural hiftory ; among which, it had been 
difficult to fettle the exa<5t fpecies of the 

Macrufey 



Mdcrujfe, a bird allowed by tlie Roman 
Catholics to be eaten in Lent. Their ob- 
fervations relating to this particular were 
publiihed in the PJbil. Tranf. for 1685, in 
No. 172* It proved to be the Scoter, ox^ 
Anas nigra Linnai4 

We are now come to that.perfbfmance, 
which LiNNiEus and Haller fo juftly 
ftile Opiu immenji laboris % and which, con- 
sidered as the work of one man, has per- 
haps been exceeded by none, unlefs indeed 
by that of John Bauhine, who, however, 
did not live to put the finifhinghand to his 
labour. 

Mr. Ray informs us^ that it was at the 
perfuafion-of his friend, Mr. Willughbv, 
that he began to colled materials^ with 
a view to a General Hiftory of Plantsu 
But that, after the lofs of his friend in 1672, 
he relapsed; and, on hearing that Dr; Mo- 
ri son was employed on a fimilar defign, 
from which confiderable expedations were 
formed, at length gave up his purpofe. On

it was dedicated^ he reiumedhis dofign, and 
profccutcd the work with vigour. We can- 
not fafficiently admire the wonderful afii- 
duity and addrefs of this great man^ which 
enabled hini, in four years, to colled: fuch 
a ftock of matter, as to furnifli two folio 
volumes, of near one thouiand pages -each. 
It even does not appear that he had the 
affiftance of an amanuenfis in this labour; 
which ht effeded, however, with a fkill 
and judgment that gained him the applaufe 
of all fucceeding makers in the fcience. 

This important undertaking was intended 
by the author to comprehend the whole 
botany of the age, by defcribing feparatelj^, 
and reducing to his own fyAem, all the 
plants of the Bauhines, and of thofe who 
had enlarged the flock by fubiequent dif- 
coverics, Thefc, at the publication of R ay's 
firft volume, were, the plants of Mexico, 
from Hernandez ; thofe of Brafil^ from

with that concifenefs and methodical accu- 
racy, which, I believe, had rarely, if ever, 
been equalled by preceding writers. This 
has rendered the introdudlion to his Hif-

valuable in, the fcience of hid day ; nor ii

In the general arrangement of the fub-. 
jedl, according to his own fyftem, he has in 
various inftances improved the claflcs. At 
the head of each book or clafs is prefixed 
a fynoptical table of all the chapters or ge^ 
nera. 

In the particular difpofition, after prefix-- 
ing to each chapter the etymology of the 
generical name, he gives the charadler of 
the genus % and in the enumeration of the 
fpecies, (quotes at length the fynonyms of

feldom introducing others, where the plant 
was known to any of thefe writers* 

His defcriptions of the old plants are 
^aken from the above-mentioned authors. 
They are commonly abridged, however; and 
in jiumberlefs inftances amended, from his 
own knowledge of the plants, Jle fails not 
to notice from whom they are taken, and has 
every where diftinguiflied the Britijh plants 
from the exotics. He has carefully marked .

In the '' Hifl:pry of Trees/' the no-

kingdom, as being dignified by the variety 
of their uies in human ceconomy, he has 
extended his reiearches, and coUeded, with 
much afliduity, a greater variety of intier^ftr 
ing particulars. Mr. Ray has purpofeljr 
avoided entering into nice and critical dif- 
quifitions relating to the fpecies'; for, befides 
that this would have fwelled his work to 
an enormous bulk, it was beconae Ipfk nc- 
ceflary, after the defcriptions given by JoSm 
Bauhine, Clusius, and others, fb much 
fuperior to thofe of their predeceflbrs ; and 
the more curious and critical examiner nnght 
be referred to thefc authors, for ample fcopc 
to his curiofity, 

Mr. Ray has defcribed, in thefc vo- 
lumes, about 6900 plants; including^ how- 
ever, in this number, many which modern 
botenifts have fince confidered as varie-< 
tks. 



The Addenda to the fecond volume: con- 
tain feveral intfcrefting catalogues; fucb 
are thofc of Zanoni's Hiftory, confifting 
of new Italian J Siotfi, and Milanefe plants ; 
thofe of Breynius; a catalogue of the 
plants of Virginia, obferved by Mr.BANis-^ 
TEA ; and a coqipend of thofe of Mexico , 
from Hernandez, who, at the expence 
oi iixty thoufand ducats, had procured 
the paintings of 1200 fpecies, which pe- 
]:ilbed in a fire of the EfcuriaL 

In the preface to the firft volume, Mr# 
Ray acknowledges his obli^tions for* af-* 
iiftance received from many of hisr friends. 
Among thofe who had more effentklly 
contributed to enrich his work, were. Sir 
Edward Hulse, Dr. ^ancred Robi^tson^ 
J>n Sloan e, and his near neighbour, Mr* 
Dale. To thefe he adds, in the fecond 
volume, the names of William Gourtine, 
Efqi of the Middle Temple^ Dr. Pluke* 
^ET, Mr, DooDY, and Mr. Petiver. 

There are^ copies of Ray's Hiftory, 
with the date of 1 693 ; but I believe the 
titlc-^pagc only to be new, the remaining 

Qjf copies

copies of the impreflion by Faitborne^ fal^ 
ling into the hands of Smith and Walford 
about that time. Foreign writers mention 
an edition fo late as 171 6 ; but this I fuf- 
pe(9: to be a miftake, or owing to anethcp 
transfer of the copies. ' 

After the firft edition of the *^ Catalogm 
Plantarum Angliit " was out of print, Mr. 
Ray had been exhorted by his friend, T)v. 
Ralph Johnson, to arrange the fecond ac- 
cording to fyftem 5' but not having fuffi- 
ciently elaborated his method, at that time^ 
he declined it; and it cajne out in 1677, 
in the alphabetical order. 

A third edition being wanted, however, 
after the publication of the â™¦* Hiftory of 
^*Â»^ Plants," he meditated throwing it into 
the fyfteniatic form; and, in the mean time, 
put forth, in 1688," Fasciculus StiRt

to attend motÂ« minutely to generical cba-

RAY, 

TO ^his period Mr, Ray had appea|4 
ed to the public principally as a na-* 
turalift ; but he now united to this charac- 
ter that of the theolpgift. It is needlefs to 
fay, that he fuccceded in this department;! 
perhaps beyond moft of thojfe who had be- 
fore written on the fame fubjed. His iirll 
publipatipn of this kind, we are told, wa?

CTiginally, and in its outlines. College Exer^ 
tifes only, or Common Piac^s. Thefe he 
now wrought up, and enlarged into a con- 
venient volume', and trufted it to the care 
tof his friend. Dr. Tancred Rqbinson, who 
procured five hundred copies to be printed^ 
under the following title : ** The Wis-^ 
^* DOM OP God manifested in the 
** Works of the Creation/' 8Â°. i69i* 
It was reprinted the next year. The ele- 
venth edition was publiihed in 1743 i and 
a twelfth in 1758 ; and, I believe, feveral 
times fince : and it has been tranflated into 
foreign languages. Thefe are fufficient tt(^ 
timonies of the eftcem with which it was 
received by the public. 

It is not immediately within my plan to 
enlarge on this work, or to determine whe- 
ther the arguments a priori y ox a pojieriori^ 
are beft calculated to obtain the obje<9: of it, 
** Demonftration of the Being of a God.'' 
** ^i hijioriam naturce^ natunse etiam Creator 
r^m colit.'^ I may be allowed to obferve, that 
^r. Ray, from that comprehenfive view of 
nature which his mind embraced, was iingu- 
krly well qualified tQ difplay the manifold 

wondera 



^3^ C H A P * t R tg* 

wonders of (he creation^ and the wlfdom o^ 
its omnipotent Author. And thus, wh3e 
his penetrating views enabled him to unfold 
the various ceconomy and evolutions of na*Â«Â» 
ture to the greatef): advantage^ his piety and 
humility give a force to his reafonings and 
dedudions^ that carries with it a convidion 
of that great truth he fb fincerely wished to 
inculcate. 

The favourable acceptance the public 
gave to the " Demonftration/' encouraged 
Mr. Ray to publifh, the next year, hit 
** Three Physico-theological Dis- 
'^ COURSES concerning the primitive Chads, 
** and Creation of the World. The general 
â€¢* Deluge, its caufes and efFefts. The Dif- 
" folution of tlie World, and future Confla- 
" gnition." 8*. 1692, and 1693. 171 3. 
pp. 456, 1 72 1* 1732. It is embellished 
with a plate of the i/ifam^ean medal, and 
three tables of figured fofiils; and is dedi- 
cated to Archbifliop Tfllotson. 

This work is a convincing proof of the 
exteniive reading, the various erudition, and 
multii^rious knowledge, of ihk great and 
good man. lodepeadent c^ aU the theories

it contains, this volurac exhibits fudl 4in 
aflemhlage of fafts, relating to the ftruc- 
tare of this glofee, to the changes it ha? 
tindergone, and to the hiftory of figured 
ifofGls, that it may be read to advantage, 
even in this age of advanced curiofity, and 
knowledge in the profefled ofojed: of this 
book. Even the faftidious critic, v^ho is 
verfed in all the more nfMxlern theories, 
down to the *^ Epochas of Nature,*' and 
thofe of M. De Lu<:, and De Soulavib, 
will allow that this volume, when refpeflk 
is had to the time of its publication, muli 
have convejred a large (hare of intclligencte 
to thofe who were capable of gratificatioti 
from difquifitions of this nature ; and that, 
with a deference to the opinions of the day, 
there is yet a freedom of enquiry that dif- 
tinguifhes the author, as a friend to true 
philofophy, and as a modeft and candid en- 
quirer after truth, in thofe points of natural 
hiftory, which ftill continue, and probably 
long will, to be involved in great obfcurity. 

In this year, Mr, Ray wrote fome 

^ Obfcrvations on the Planting of Maize 

â€¢* inftead oi Teafi^'' occafioned by a pro- 

5 pofal 



i4d CHAPTER i^. 

pofal of Sit" Richard BulkleYi in whicjf 
he fays, that he had found the greateil: 
yield of peafc to be twenty barrels reaped 
for one fown ; whereas, from one grain of 
Indian wheats he .had calculated the pro- 
duce would be upwards of 2000 grains for 
one. Thefe Obfervations were printed in 
the PhiL Tranf. N"" 205. Mr. Ray was 
not fanguine in his expe<5lations from the 
culture of that grain ; neither have fuble- 
quent trials proved the utility of it in this 
climate. 

The botanical labours of this eminent 
man were now remitted, at leaft for fome 
time ; and we find, that after the publica- 
.tion of his *' Hijiory,"' and the ** SynopJisy\ 
his exertions were turned into another 
channel, in which he alfo flood unrivalled 
in his day. It was not botany alone that 
he raifed from a drooping ftate> to zoo- 
logy, confidered as a fcience, he might b? 
faid to have given birth, in thefe kingdoms; 
fince, except what himfelf and Mr. Wil- 
LUGHBY had performed, nothing of im- 
portance on the hiftory of animals exifled. 

Topsell's ** Abridgment of GESNERr'

MoFFAT*s ^* Bqpk .on lafcdts;'' and the 
(hort and imperfe(ft cflkysof Charleton, 
in his ^* Onomajiicmr and of Merret, in 
his ** Pinax,'* were ahnoft the only Englijh 
.writers to be confulted. To aflert that 
better ^hclps were wanted, is not to injure, 
or to degrade thofc authors, Mr. Ray had 
been urged by his friends, and particularly 
by Dr. Robinson, to undertake an entire 
Fauna Anglica, and a hiftory of Fof^ 
JUs alio ; but age and infirmities began now 
to oppiTpfs him, and he thought himfelf in- 
adequate to the attempt. He lived, how- 
ever, to perform more than his fears, or his 
humility permitted him to hope. 

In 1693, hepublifhed his " Synopsis

In this volume we fee the firft truly fyf-

Tpi^I. R his 



442 CHAPTER 19. 

his fucceflbrs in the /ame line have equally 
applauded, and availed themfelves of. It is 
profefledly the bafis of that method, by 
ivhich the prefent eminent zoologift of this 
nation, has chofen to convqr his learned 
publications, and by which he has not lefs 
happily difFufed a tafte for this fcience, than 
he has fucccfsfuUy improved its ftore. 

In treating on animals in general, intro-, 
duftory to his work, he difcufles fome im- 
portant queftions, which had not then 
ceafed to agitate the philofophical world. 
He controverts, with extreme force of rea- 
foning, the ideas of equivocal or fponta- 
neourf generation ; the Lewenhoekian hypa- 
thefis; and that of all animals bcihg created 
from eternity, and only latent in an in- 
volved ftate. I know not where the reader 
can fee thefe queftions difcufled with equal 
concifenefs and judgment united. . 

Mr. Ray's Diftribution of Animals is not 
wholly founded, as to the grand divifions, 
on the Arijiotelian diftinftions ; though he 
admits many of them. It is not within roy 
plan to enter on this fubjeft; it is fufficient to 
obferve, thdX^adrupeds here form two great 

diviiions. 



i2^> 243 

divifiotas, as they jarc hoofed or digitated i 
the fornner, as. they, are 'mhole or cloven; 
the latter, as they ^x^ divided into more, or 
fewer plaws ; admitting alfo of fubdivifions 
ox genera^ from the number of the claws, 
and in fome, from the confideration of the 
teeth. 

At the time when Mr. Ray lived, few 
people had acquired a tafte f9r this kind of 
knowledge, and. commerce had. not lent her 
friendly aid, as in later times. What ani^ 
mals came under his own infpeftion, he 
has defcribed wijh his aQcuftomcd, accu- 
racy; from GeÂ§ner and Albroyand hf 
borrows his defcriptions of others ; . and 
many later difcovered fubjedls he drew from 
Piso and Marcgraave, from Clu- 
sius, Hernandez, Laet, apd Nierem- 

BERG. 

In the courfe of this work, he has, in va- 
rious inftances, given the anatomical ftruc- 
ture, from .Dr. Tyson, from the " Pari/ian 
/* Diffe<aions," and other works. Through- 
out the whole, he has fhewn how intimately 
he Wjas acquainted with the learning of the 
; ancients,and particularly with Aristotle, 

R 2 whom. 



444 C H A P T E R I9Â« 

whom, as the parent of zoological know- 
ledge, he failed not to confult on all oc- 
Cafions, but by no means implicitly^ fol- 
low, in his fubtkties and obfcuiities. 

On finiftiing the *^ Synopfis of Quadra-^ 
** -peds," Mr. Ray immtidktely drew up 
that of the Birds and Fijhes. This was an 
cftfier -tdk at this time, fince they are -to be 
confidered -as compends of his preceding 
labours with his friend, Mr, Willuohby ; 
although there were -many things new in 
toth, and that of the Fi(hes was very 
greatly improved as to the arrangemfent and 
method. He informs us, that the addi- 
tions were, the ilf<?AriV^ birds, from He r- 
NANBBz ; fome defcriptions of new fpecies, 
t>ut of NiEUHOFF 5 Martin's Birds and 
Fifties of Gremlandi Sibbald's Whales ; 
Sloan e's "Jamaica Birds and Fiihes; and 
fome from the X/?y4/i?^Gatalogue, by. Dr. 

R0BINSO>T. 

In thefe branches of nature, Mr. Rait 
again appears as the parent of mtethod. 
The accurate Brissom regards Ray and 
WiLLUGHBY, as the firft true ^ftematic 
vwriters on birds. Thefe works weittfiiiiflwl 

in 



in theryear 1693 ori694i as weieara from 
Mr. Ray's letters, .and from the teftiraony 
of hk friend and neighbour, Mr* D axk. 
Yeti. excellent as thqr. were, fo fcanty was 
th& tafte for natural hiftory at this period, 
that the nKLnufcripts lay unpubliihed in the 
bookfellers hands, till .they were purchafedl 
by Mr. Innys^ and prepared for the pref* 
by Dn Derham, who added the -figures^ 
and infertcd Mr. Buckley's Birds from 
Madrafs^ and Mr* Jagg's Gornijh Fiihes. 
They were publiflied in 17 1.3, under the 
titles of ** Synopsis methodic a Avi- 
um." 8*. pp. 198. t. 2; and ^* Synop- 
sis ms^hodicaPiscium.'' 8% pp. itz. 
t. I). 

In the fame year, 1693, Mr. Ray became 
the editor of a tranflition of " Dr. Rau- 
^* wolf's Travels.'- This phyfician, who 
was thiBL next after Belon, whom.the love 
of natural hiftory alone, led to travel intQ 
the:eaft, Ipent the yiears 1573^4-5.10 tra- 
vÂ«rfing Syria^ Mefopotamia^ Pakjim^. and 
Mgypt^ induced, as he tells us, by his deiire 
to behold, in the native places, the plants

R 3 His 



246 CHAPTER 19^ 

His ** Travels " having been publiflicd 
in 1583, in the German language, had hi- 
therto been locked up from the Englijh 
reader. Sir Hans Sloane having, how- 
ever, read them, was induced, in concert 
with Capt. Hatton, to procure a tranfla- 
tion of them, which was done by Nicholas 
Staphorst. This verfion was put into 
Mr. Ray's hands, to revife and corre(% 
He did more ; he made a choice feledion 
from other authors, who had made the 
fame, tour, Belon, Alpinus, ^it George 
Wheler, &c. and he drew up a Cata- 
logue of the more rare Plants of thofe 
countries through which Rauwolf tra- 
velled ; and added lifts of thofe of Mgypt 
and Crete. From this circumftance, the 
book has g6ne by the name of ** Ray's 
** Collection of Travels ;" and it 
was reprinted with his own " Obferva- 
'* tions," in 1738. Rauwolf macfe an 
^* Herbarium^"' while in the eaft; which, 
with his EÂ«r^/^^Â« plants, conftitu ted four 
large volumes. Thefe became the property 
of Queen Cbrijlina^ and afterwards, by her 
means probably* of Ifaac Vossius, who in^

ling had been offered for them. They were 
purchafed of his heirs by the univerfity of. 
Ley deny and the late Dr. Frederick Gro- 
Novius conftrudled from them an elegant 
and learned ^^ Flora Ortentalis \' of which 
he much enhanced the value, by prefixing 
to it Melchier Adams's ** Life of Rau- 
*f WOLF," with large additions of his 
own. 
The ** Catalogus Stirpium in ex- 

TERIS ReGIONIBUS OBSERVATARUM " 

being out of print, Mr. Ray was induced 
to give a new edition of it, with fuch large 
augmentations, as to make it a new work. 
He added from Clusius, from the Bau- 
HiNEs, and other authors, a number of 
plants growing in thofe regions through 
which he paffed in his tour j and fo many 
catalogues from other authors, as to render. 
it a tolerably complete lift of all the Euro^ 
fean plants, not natives of England. As it 
does not immediately refpeft EngliJIi botany,

In the preface to this work, Mr. Kay,- 
for the firft time, entered into controverfy";- 
having taken occafion to throw out fbrilc 
ftriftores on the method of botany pub- 
lilhcd by Rivinxts in 1690. It is not 
enough interefting at this day^ to dwell on 
the nature of it; It is fufScient to obfervc, 
that our veteran in fcience was diflatisfied^ 
with the German^ for throwing the trees 
promifcuoufiy into the clafles with other 
plants, and for breaking ihto the natural 
orders, for the fake of agreement in ther 
flower alone. In faft, Rivinus's method- 
being founded' wholly on the flower, to 

which 



Bay. 2(49^ 

\;7hich pai^t Ray had paid but final! regard^? 
the fbarces df controverfy were endlcfs; 
fince the fundamental principles of each 
were totally irreconcileable. 

About this time Mr. Ray communka* 
ted ** The Provincial Catalogues of Plants/* 
printed at the end of each county, in the 
edition of **C A MB den's Britanriia,'' pub- 
lifhed in 1695 by Mr. GIbson. His re- 
peated travels throughout rnoft parts of 
England^ for the fole purpofe of inveftigit-^ 
ing the fubjedls of nature, had eriabled- 
him td accomplifh more than had beea 
done by any man before his time ; and his 
unqucftionable fkill aiid accuracy, aidded an 
authenticity to thefe lifts, whic^ could 
not eafily have been derived from any other 
hand; 

To the county of Cornwall Mr. Ray 
added many other particulars; which, how- 
ever, were not printed, probably becaufe 
the correfponding circuriiftarices could nof 
be procured from other counties. Thefe 
were, ** Catalogues of the SeaFifh, and Sea 
Fowl, with the fynonyms ;*' feme account 
of two or three forts of ftoiie dug there 1 
of fea fandjr as manure ; an account of the 

hurkrs^ 



250^ CHAPTER 19. 

bftrlers^ and other ftones ; and notices rc^ - 
fpeding the manners and language of the 
iphabitants. / 

Such as are converfant with that fcience, 
which was the favourite objedt of Mr. Ray, 
muft be fenfible that nothing could have 
happened more conducive to the revival and 
improvement of it at this jundlurc, than the 
circumftance of its having been taken up 
by a man of fuch patient induftry, capable 
at the fame time of giving it all the em- 
belliftiments, and advantages that learning 
could afford. They will readily grant that 
his WTitings and example alone, added more 
vigour, and brought more difciples to this 
fchool of natural fcience in England^ thau. 
all the exertions of foregoing writers. 

I cannot confirm and illuftrate the truth 
of this pofition more effedlually, than by 
calling to the attention of. the curious in

tion it acquired, in the interval between

latter work j during which, exclufive of 
the difcovery of many fubjed:s, among what 
wtere called the more perfect plants, a new 
and very extenfive field had been opened, 
by exciting attention to the lefs perfeSi' (as 
they were then accounted) and minuter 
kinds of vegetables, the Fungi^ Fuci, 
Mufcij and Alga^ known now by the name 
of Cryptogamice. During the firft of thefe 
periods, 250 fpecies had been added to the 
Englijh Flora ; and the accefSon in the 
laft exceeded that number. 

In no part of Europe had the fame pro- 
grefs been made in the inveftigation of 
thefe hitherto much-negledted fubjeds, as 
in England^ during the period above men- 
tioned. This is fufficiently evinced by 
comparing the fecond edition of the ** Sy- 
*â€¢ NOPSis" with the contemporary writings 
of foreign botanifts. 

This fecond edition of the ** Synopsis ** 
was printed in 1696. 8% pp. 346. Mr, 
Ray himfelf had but a fmall fhare in the 
augmentations that were made to this edi- 
^on. His advancing years and infirmities 
prevented him from making excurfions. His 

principal

preface ; in which^ additional to the names 
in the former â€¢* Synopsis," we meet with 
thofe of Mr. Edward Llhwyd, Walter 
MoYLE, Efq; and Mr. William Vernon, 
fellow of St. Peters College, Cambridge. 

To thofe who are feniible of the obliga- 
tions which the fcience owes to Mr. Ray, 
it cannot but be grateful to read, with what 
fatisfaftion the good man records, in this 
pre&ce, the progrefs he had lived to fee his 
favourite ftudy make in his own country, 
and with what delight he augurs and con- 
. templates its future improvement. In the 
fpace of little more than tv(^nty years, 
and under his dwn pen, he had feen the 
Englijh Flora acquire an acceffion of up* 
wacds of 500 new fubjedts. The ** Ca-

that the retrenchments arc compaiativel/ 
few. 

With this edition of the '* Synopsis," 
was publiflied the " Dissertatio db 
VARUS Plantarum Methodis bre- 
vis /* in which Mr. Ray (hews, that the 
fcparation of plants into ckfles and genera 
from the fructification alone, mufl: be a 
very gradual and progreffive affair; that 
it was not eafy to exclude the habit from 
Jiaving a ihare in this diftribution, fince 
there were many plants that were fel- 
dom or never feen in flower by the early 
botanifts. He alfo obferves, that number- 
lefs plants, which agree in the ftnwfture of 
the flower; diifer materially in habit, and 
others vice verfa. And although his own 
method is principally founded on the fruit, 
yet he freely acknowledges its imperfections j. 
but thinks the fame objections hold againft 
the flower; which he illuftrates by (hewing, 
in Tournbfort's fyfl:em, the uncertainty 
of the bounds between the Flares infundU 
huliformes^ hypocrateriformes^ and the caryo-- 
fhylleu If Mr. Ray paid lefs regard to the 
'flower than its importance feemed tade-i

the 



254 CHAPTER 19. 

the principles of his method, than from his 
want of opportunities of examination, ow- 
ing to his diftance from botanical gardens, 
as was alledged by his opponents ; a cir- 
cumftance, however, which he very feeling- 
ly laments in the preface to his " Metho-- 
BUS," and elfewhere. 

To this is annexed, *' Epistola de

On the method of Rivinus, Mr. Ray, 
as was before noticed, had thrown out fomc 
ftri<aures in the preface to his ** Sylloge^** 
which drew from that author the anfwer 
here puhliihed, and Mr. Ray's reply 5 ia 
which our author takes occafion alfb to 
defend his method from the objeftions of 
TouRNEFORT, who had bpen unbecom- 
ingly fevere in fome animadverfions made 
in the ** Elements of Botany^'* publiOied in 
1694. TouRNEFORT, however, afterwards 
did ample juftice to the merits of our au- 
thor. 

The modern botanift fees that all thefc 
controverlies are become too little intereft-

Ing to dwell upon at this time. The prin- 
ciples of the CoroIIjfia, and the Fru^ijhce, 
as LiNNiEUs ftyles them, can never be 
ailimilated, and all attempts to reduce 
the whole vegetable kingdom into natural 
claffes have hitherto failed. 

In 1697, he wrote ** Some Obfervations 
" on the Poifonous EfFedts of a Root eaten 
** inftead of Parfneps/' fuppofcd to have 
been that of the. Hemlock; but of which 
Mr. Ray had fome doubt, alledging, that 
it was more probably the Cicutaria vulgaris^ 
(Chcerophyllum fylvefire^ Lin.) See FhiL 
Tranf. N** 23 1 . In N* 238, he communi- 
cated " Remarks on the Poifonous EfFefts

confirmed by later miftakes of the fame

In the year 1700, Mr. Ray publiflied

THE peaceable mind of Mr. Ray 
could not delight in the contentious 
field of controverfy; on the contrary, he 
regretted the occafions that drew him into 
it : yet were they not without ufe, finca 
they unqueftionably ftimulated him to pu- 
rify and correal his own Methodus. This he 
efFedted in the year 1698, although at this 
time much declined in his health, being 
afflidled with ulcers of the lower extremi- 
ties, the pain of which rendered his nights 
frequently fleeplefs, and wholly prevented 
him from making excurfions to London^ as 
he much defired, to examine the gardens 
and herbaria of the curious.

So fmall, however, was the demand for 
books in this fcience, at the entrance of this 
century, that the London bookfellers were 
unwilling to rifk the printing of it : and it 
was finally fcnt to Holland^ and printed at 
Amfierdanty under the care of Dr. Hot- 
TON, the botanical profciTor at Leyden^ who 
fupervifed the prefs, and procured 1 1 oa 
copies to be thrown off, under the title of 
â€¢^Methodus Plantarum emendata 
ET AUCTA : accedit Methodus Graminum, 
yuncorum^ et Cyperoriim fpecialis.'* 8*. pp. 
202. 1703. Dr. Hot TON gave a further 
fandion to the fyftem of his friend ; he 
taught it in his le<3:urcs to the pupils of 
that univerfity, and informed Mr. Ray of 
the good acceptance it met with on the 
continent, particularly in Italy. This vo- 
lume was reprinted at Amjierdam in 17 10, 
and at Tubingen in 1 7 3 3 . 

In the preface he recapitulates his own 
progrefs in the formation of his fyftem, and 
dates it from the tables drawn up in 1667 
for the ufe of Biihop Wilkins. He very 
juftly reprehends Dr. Mori son, for afFed- 
ing to have formed his method entirely 

5 ^^^^ 



frbm his owft obfervations, without acknow- 
ledging the fmallcft aid from former wri- 
ters ; briefly recites his objedliofts to the 
methods of RiviNUS, Tournefort, and 
Herman ; and defends his own. He eflab- 
lifhes fome axioms, to be obferved in fram- 
ing a fyftcm of botany. In fad:, Mr. Ray's 
method, though he aflumes the fruit as the 
foundation, is ati elaborate attempt, for that 
time, to fix natural clafTes. He eftabliflies 
it as a rule, that no plant is to be fepafated 
from its tribe for a fingle note of difference; 
but that all are to be afSmilated, as far as 
habit will allow. The charadrers of the 
genera are, however, highly incongruous ; 
they are taken from vague principles, fuch 
as the fhape of the leaf, colour of the flower, 
tafle, fmell, and fometimes from the fize of 
the plant, and other as unflable diftindions. 
In this amended edition, Mr. Ray ftill 
adheres to the ancient divifion into trees 
and herbaceous plants, having dropped the 
diftindtion of (hrubs, preferved in the firft 
edition. Here, all herbaceous, and fhrubby- 
ftalked plants are divided into twenty-five 
genera or c\zKt^ i as follow:

At this time, the confideration of Mr. 
Ray's method is a matter of mere curio- 
fity ; yet, in juftice to this great man, it 
muft be remarked, that his fyftem, though 
lefs artificial than that of C-ffis alpine, is 

S 3 much 



262 CHAPTER 20. 

much more highly elaborated than that of 
Morison: and, though Mr. Ray muft 
have taken infimte pains with it> yet is it 
difficult in pradice ; fince the bafes of the 
plafles are not uniform* Of the thirty- 
three> however, twelve are nearly com- 
pofcd of natural orders. Such are the foU 
Jowing : 

Fungi f Afpertfolia,

Capillares^ Pomifera^ 

Planipetalce, Sitiquofa^ 

JJmbellifera^ Leguminofa^

The rcn\aining cbflea arc combined of 
fubjeas lefs.conneifted by habit and ftruc- 
ture ; and are therefore fubjed: to more ar- 
bitrary rules, drawn from the confideration 
of fomepne, or more parts, in the fru^fi- 
tion. 

In the ** Mbthopits Grnmnum^ Junco- 
rum\ et CyperorumJpeciaRs^* annexed to this 
book, Mr. Ray's diftribuitic^i refts princi- 
pallv on what may be called the habit of

ticeumi Gramen loliaceufn*,typhinumi Gra^

ConfpeBuSj however, all the fpecies are 
introduced, to the amount of two hun- 
dred. 

Sixteen years had now elapfed fince the 
publication of his " Hiftory of Plants ;" in 
which interval botany had aflumed a new 
face, and experienced a much greater revo- 
lution and acceflion, than had ever taken 
place before. Syftem had been ftudied, and 
in fome meafure eftabliihed, both at home 
and abroad. An incredible number of new 
plants had been introduced, from all parts 
of the world, and cultivated with extreme 
care in the gardens of Europe, In the 
mean time, thefe circumftances had given 
rife to a great number of valuable public* 
cations. The remaining fix volumes of 

S 4 that 



264 CHAPTER 20. 

that ineftimable work, the " Hortus 
Malabaricus," had appeared: Brey- 
Nius, Herman, Tournefort, Plu- 
MiER, Plukenet, Boccone, Comme- 
line, Bobart, Cupani, Volkamer, 
and RiviNus, had enriched botany with 
valuable performances. Thefe large aug- 
mentations to the fcience induced Mr. 
Ray, notwithftanding his advanced years 
and ill health, to attempt a coUeftion of 
thefe fcattered materials, in order to form 
a fupplemental volume to his ** Hif- 
*' tory ;" and his induftry enabled him to 
iffFeft his purpofe. Additional to the-afSft- 
ances derived from all thefe printed works, 
he had accefs, by the favour of Sir Hans 
Sloane, to the MS. of his " Hiftory of 
" Jamaica Plants" (of which the " Pro^ 
dromus*' had been publiflied in 1696) with 
liberty to fele(3; what he thought proper to 
his defign. 

From the fame gentleman he enjoyed the 
benefit of an Herbarium of feveral hundred 
pew and undefcribed plants, collected mMa* 
ryland, by Mr. Vernon and Mr. Kreig, 
who had made a voyage, thither for the 

fole 



Ray. 265 

folc purpofe of gratifying their tafte in bo- 
tany. Mr. Petiver freely communicated 
his ftores, at that time very ample,: though 
afterwards abundantly more, fo ; and Dr. 
Sherard engaged, befides fupplying more 
than a thoufand fpecies himfelf, to take the 
trouble of infpedting the whole work before 
it went to the prefs, and of making fuch cor- 
rections and additions as he judged proper. 

It was the laft of his works publifhed in 
his life- time,, and came out in 1704, with 
the following title : 

" HisTORiJE Plantarum Tomus 
tertius, qui eji Supplementum duorum

Lond. folio, pp. 666 ; and the " Dendro^ 
logia;' pp. 135, App. pp. I'^.j. 

The diftribution is the fame as that of 
the two former volumes. In a compilation 
of this kind, colle<Sed from fo numerous a 
fet of authors, and in many inftances from 
dried and imperfect ipecimens, there mull 

. neceflarily 



a66 CHAPTER 20* 

neceffarily arife a multitude of repeti- 
tions. The author was fufficicntly aware 
of this I but it was unavoidable. In this 
volume there are upwards of 1 1 ^700 plants 
enumerated. 

The Appendix contains feveral catalogues^ 
which muft have been interefting to the 
curious at that time. Father Cambll^' a 
learned Jefuit of Manila^ who had not only 
defcribed^ but delineated, a great number of 
the plants of Luzone, tranfmitted his work 
to Mr. Ray ; and it forms an exteniive 
part of this Appendix. It muft have been 
much regretted, that the Rev. Father had 
not been furnished with books to have en- 
abled him to adapt the iynonyms; fince 
there are few inftances in which any other 
names occur, than the Spanijh^ and the in- 
digenous appellations of the natives and 
Mollis. 

Mr. Ray then gives a lift of Tourne- 
fort's oriental difcoveries, from the " Co-. 
rolhriumi' thofe of Dampier, from New 
floliand and elfewhcre, and of Martens'* 
Greenland Vhsit^ I of Commeline's Rare 
Exotics; a copious Catalogue of Chineft^

Ray. 267 

Madrafsy ^nd jifrican Plants^ communicated 
by Mr. Peti vbr, of which, thofc fromMa^ 
drafs had been collected by Mr. Browne, 
a furgeon at that fettlement ; and laftly, a 
lift of the new, or hitherto very imperfbdtly 
defcribed fpecies, contained in Mr. Peti- 
ver's Hortus Siccus, amounting to upwards 
of 800. 

An advertifement had been printed at the 
end of the firft volume of Mr. Ray's " HiA 
tory," in 1688, inviting to a fubfcription 
for a fet of figures to the work ; and it was 
propofed, that thofe belonging to each tribe 
or clafs, fhould be publifhed in regular fuc- 
ceffion; but it did not fuccecd. The fcheme 
was again revived, while-the Supplement was 
fMrinting; and, among other of Mr. Ray's 
friends. Dr. Compton, bifhop of London, 
had given his patronage, and ftrongly re- 
commended it. Conferences were held with 
Dr. Sherard, Sir Hans Sloane, Dr. Ro- 
binson, and Mr. Petiver, relating ta it| 
but it was relinquifhed as impracticable* 

MrÂ» Ray's infirmities were very prefRng 
ypoa himi during the later years of his lifeÂ» 

In 



2i8 CHAPTER 20, 

In a letter, written in the fpring of 1702, 
he informs Mr. Dekham that he had not 
been half a mile from his own houfe for 
four years. Yet, under thefe circumftances, 
he wrote his fupplemental volume to his 
" Hiftory of Plants," which, he fays, had 
cngrofled almofl: his whole time for two 
years. 

We have now brought Mr. Ray's bo- 
tanical works to a conclufion ; but his la- 
bours did not ceafe* here. His adive and 
indefatigable mind prompted him, at thf 
age of feventy-five, to begin a work on /Â»- 
fe5is 'y to which he had been encouraged by 
Dr. Derham ; and for which he had been 
accumulating materials during niany years. 
This was intended to comprehend only the 
Englijh fpecies; although, at the fame time, 
his friends were wiihing to engage him to 
defcribe the exotics of the London Mufea, 
which were then beginning to abound in 
thefe. fubjedts. 

He had paid fome attention to the hif- 
tory of Spiders, indeed, many years be- 
fore, when intimately conneded with Dr. 

LiSTERJ 



Ray. . 269 

Lister; but the greater part of his 
work was drawn up from his own aftual 
defcriptions, and partly from Mr. Wil- 
lughby's papers, and the contributions 
of friends, Mr. Petiver, Mr. Dan- 
DRiDGE, Dr. Sloane, Mr. Morton, 
and Mr. Stonefleet. 

He tells us, that in the later years of his 
life he had difcovered 300 kinds of Papilhsy 
diurnal and nocturnal; and knew there were 
many more. The Beetles ^ he obferves, were 
as numerous, and the Flies not lefs fo. I 
mention thefe qircumftances to prove the 
extenfive knowledge of nature which thi? 
extraordinary man pofleiTcd, at an aera when 
he flood fo nearly alone in thefe branches^ 
of fcience. He did not live to finifli this 
work. It was publifhed by Dr. Derham 
in 1710, in 4\ pp. 398* 

I believe Mr. Ray was the firfl: who 
gave to thefe minuter animals a real and 
fcientific diftribution. He had drawn up a 
fhort*' Methodus Insectorum," which 
was publifhed the year after his death. Of 
the hiflory itfelf, it is fufficieht to fay, that 
it bears all the characters of that accurate, 

difcriminating.

diicriminating, and fyflematic genius, whkh 
guided him in all his refearches in the field 
of nature^ and that it is every where quoted 
by the eminent Sweiie with the higheft 
commendations, for the faithful defcriptions 
it contains. 

Mr. Ray's infirmities and afflidions, 
painful and grievous as they were, did not, 
we are told, prevent him from profecuting 
his fludies till within about three months 
before his death ; which event took place 
on Jan* 17, 1704-5. 

He died at Black Not/ey, and was buried, 
as Dr. Derham fays, according to his own 
defire, in the church of that parifh. The 
writers of the " General Diftionary," in the 
mean time, inform us, that, ** although the 
â™¦â€¢ redtor of the parifh offered him a place of 
" interment in the chancel of the church, 
" yet he modeftly refufed it, choofing rather 
" tÂ© be buried in the church-yard with his 
*^ anceflors, where a monument was ereded 
â€¢* to him," as Dr. Derham relates, at the 
charge of feme of his friends, with a Latin 
infcription; which may be feen in the ** Ge- 
** ncral Di<aionary," and in Mr. Scott's 

*'Remains>i"

below *â€¢ 

As Mr. Ray did not inherit any pater- 
nal eftate, and had often refufed preferment, 
his circumftances could never have been 
affluent ; and the legacy of Mr. Willugh- 
BY is iaid to have been the greateft part of 
what he enjoyed. His own eftate, what- 
ever that might be, he fettled on his wife.

This colledion contains 2 1 8 letters ; of

the moft frequent were Dr. Lister, Sip 
Ph'/ip Skippon, Dr. Tancred Robinson, 
Sir Har2s Slqane, Mr. Llwyd, Mr. Jes-

The correlpondence of learned and fcien- 
tific men, feldom fails to be a welcome pre- 
fent to thofe of fimilar literature and pur- 
fuits; for, befides the perfonal iritereft we 
take in their concerns, they commonly de- 
lineate, in the moft faithful colours, the 
characters of the writers, frequently afcer- 
tain difcoveries, and enable their fucceffors

remarks on this head, which were printed 
by Dr. Birch, in the third volume of the

Dr. Derham meditated writing the life 
of Mr. Ray ; but he appears not to have 
fully executed his plan. His papers, how- 
ever, were publilhed by Mr. Scott, in 
1760, under the title of " Seled: Remains 
" of the learned Join Ray/' 8*. pp. 336. 
To thefe are annexed three of the Itinera- 
ries^ which conftitute the greater part of 
the book. They are evidently fhort notes 
only, never intended for the public eye. 
Some of Mr. Ray's devotional pieces ac- 
company this colledion; and three letters 
to Dr. Derham ; with a Latin letter of 
advice and inftruftions to his pupils, the 
Mr. Willughbys. 

There is faid to be ftill extant a manu- 
fcript of Mr. Ray's, under the title of 
^' Catalogus Plantarum domejlicarum qua

ufe of the fynonyma of the two Bauhines, 
and of Gerard and Parkinson. 

Mr. Ray had the fingular happinefs of 

devoting 



Ray. 277 

devoting fifty years of his life to the culti* 
Tation. of the fciences he loved. Incited by 
the raoft ardent genius, which overcame in- 
numerable difficulties and* difcouragements, 
his labours were, in the end, crowned with 
a fuccefs, before almoft uneiqualled. He 
totally reformed the ftudies of botany and 
zoology; he raifed them to. the dignity of 
a fcience, and placed them in an advan- 
tageous point of view ; and, by his own 
inveftigations, added more real improve- 
ment to them in England^ than any of his 
predeceflbrs. 

He invented and defined many terms, ex- 
preffive of ideas before unknown to the na- 
turalifts of England i and introduced. many 
others, from writers of the beft note. As he 
wrote Latin in great purity, and with great 
facility, he gave his fubjedls all the embellifli* 
ments that learning could beftow ; and his 
extenfive erudition, and knowledge of phi- 
lofophy at large, enabled him to add many 
collateral ornaments, and ufeful obferva- 
tions, with an aptitude and judgment that 
has been much applauded. 

The extent of his improvements in fci- 
ence procured him the admiration of his

conltemporaries^ and have jufily tranfinittod 
his name to pofttrity^ among ihofe. who 
have done honour to their age and country. 
Even learned foreigners have heen eloquent 
in his praife. French writers have ffiled 
him the ** Englijh Tournefort j" an 
eulogy that fuiiiciently evinced the high 
opinion they had of his merit. And the 
Jate eminent Halle R not only attributes 
to Ray the merit of imprtnriftg and eleva- 
ting botanical knowledge, but from his lifo 
Ciaies a new asra in the records of the fci<Â« 
cnce. 

But Mr. Ray's enquiries virere not liniit-i 
ed to natural knowledge. His Foreign Tra-* 
tels and his Itineraries prove, thai antiqui-* 
tics, polity, government, and legiflation, at- 
tracted a fhare of his regard ^ . 2^ his philo^ 
logical books are evidences of his att^tion 
to language, and of his dcfire tio improve 
and ifluftrate his native tongue. 

To all thefe endowments he joined an 
uftfemitting induftry and perfeverancc fti the 
firofecution of his ftudiesi and, what marks 
a fortitude of mind as uncommon as it is 
enviable^ his affiduity feemed to ftrengthen 

with 



Ray. 279. 

with his age, and to bid a defiai:u:e to tha 
encfoachoients of infirmity, and the prof- 
pe<a of diflblution. I call to witnefs the. 
magnitude of the attempt, and fuccefsfiil 
iffue of his exertions, in writing the fupple- 
mental volume to his *^ Hiftory of Plants," 
and iri beginning the ** Hijioria InfeBorum " 
at fo late a period of his life. 

His fingukr modefty, aiFability, and com-, 
municative difpofition, fecured to him the 
efteem of all who knew him ; and his emi- 
ncnt talents as a naturalift and a philofo- 
pher procured him many patrons and friends, 
and preferved him from that obfcurity^ 
which would otherwife probably have been 
his lot : for^j notwithftanding his learning 
and probity, as his principles did not accord 
with thofe of the times, they were adverfe 
to his fortune, and he gained no emoluments 
in the church. He had relinquifhed hi^ 
fellowfhip at the commencement of the Bar-r 
thohme^ adt, not, as &m^ imagined, fromt 
his having taken the Solemn League and Co^ 
v$nant (for th^t he never did, and often de^ 
clared, that he ever thought it an unlawful 
oath), but becaufe he could not declare, 
T 4 agreeably 



28o C H A P T E R 20. 

agreeably to the terms of the adt, that the 
oath was not binding on thofe who had 
taken it. Hence too, his conftant refufal of 
preferment afterwards, occafioned him to be 
ranked, by many, among the nonconfor- 
mifts, although he lived and died in the 
communion of the church oi England. He 
had feen, with deep regret, the diforders of 
the commonwealth and the ufurpation, and 
afterwards, not lefs, the threatening aipeit 
of the reign pf James IL 

His ftrong attachment to the principles 
of civil and religious liberty, is manifefted 
by his animated ftile, in the preface to hia 
** Synopfis J*' where he expreffes, in glowing 
terms, his joy and gratitude, for having 
lived to fee thofe bleffings eftablifhed by the 
Revolution, 

The charafter of Mr. Ray cannot be 
pontemplated by thofe who have a true re-Â» 
lifh for the ftudies of nature, without a 
high fentiment of refpedt and gratitude j 
jior by thofe who confider the exemplari- 
pefs of his life as a man, and his qualifica- 
tions as a divine, without veneration. 

There are two engraved portraits of Mr. 

Ray 



Ray^ 281 

Ray prefixed to his works, both from a 
painting by Faithorne y one by W. Elder^ 
before his ^* SyllogeV in. 1693, which 
feems to have been copied' for the ** Me- 
THODUS EMENDATA," in 1703 5 and the 
bther by VertuCy in 171 3, prefixed to the 
** Phyfico-theological Difcourfes/' In. both 
thefe, he is reprefented, as Mr. Ames de- 
fcribes it, in ** an oval frame, with hair, 
<^ whifkers, band, . and canonical habit." 
Thefe engravings reprefent Mr. Ray in 
the latter ftage of his life *. 

* In dedicating plants to the worthies of botanical fd- 
ence, the name of Ray challenged a dignified place; 
and the liberal-minded foreigner, whofe name has before 
occurred on thefe occafions, forgot not fo juft a tribute. 
Plumier called a new plant of the dioecious clafs, which 
bears the habit of bryony^ and is nearly allied to the yamsy 
which he firft difcovered in the ilk of Domingo^ by th^ 
name of jAiÂ«f^R a j a, in honour of our illuftrious country* 
man. Linn-^us, who had comparatively few opportuni- 
ties of correcting Plumier, eftabliflied the genus^ but 
more apdy changed it to Rajania, and enumerates three 
^ecies. He could not adopt the ftill more analogous 
term of Raia, fince it had long been preoccupied in the 
animal kingdom ; and it had been juftly conftituted an 
axiom, by the Fundamenta Botanica^ NÂ° 230, not to form, 
in the vegetable kingdom, any generical terms, fynonymous 
to fuch as were employed in zoolc%y or mineralogy.

IN all times, from Virgil and ^mi-; 
Lius Macer of the Augaftan age, 
from the fpurious Macer, and Strabus 
the monk of &t. Gall, in the twelfth cen- 
tury, to modern times, the beauties of 
flowers, and the virtues of plants, have been 
celebrated in verfe. Marcus Njevianus, 
firft a phyfician, and then a prieft, of Flan^ 
ders, fung the qualities of plants in his 
^* Poemation'' of 1563; and Thuanus, tht 
great hiftorian, amufed himfelf with praifing 
the violet and the lily in metre. In our own 
country, in 1723, George Knowles de- 
fcribed 400 plants of the Materia Medica, 
in Latin verfe, and didadtically applied them 
to their ufes in medicine. 

But to proceed : Th^t England ^nd France,

in the fame agc^ might not want their bo- 
tanical laureats, Cowley in the one, and 
Rapin in the other, arofe to celebrate this 
thfcme. 

CowLtY, after having found reafons for 
ftudying phyfic, ** confidering botany," as 
we are told by his late eminent biographer, 
** as neceffary to a phyfician, retired into 
*^ Kent, to gather plants." 

Here, he wrote, before the Reftoration, 
his ** Two firft Books on Plants/' although 
they were not publiflied till the year 1662. 
The remaining four were added in the edi- 
tion of 1668 ; and the w:hole were repub- 
lifticd, with other poen^s, in 1678, 8V 

PP- 343- 

In thcy&y? book, he celebrates the powers 

of various medicinal herbs, more efpecially 

of thofe which gave ampler fcope to his 

mufe, from antient renown of their viitue, 

and were yet in frequent ufe, and high " 

cft6em. Such were betony, wormwood, wa-. 

ter lily, miffeltoe, and various others. 

In tht fecond^ he invokes the goddefles 

Luna, Lucina, J^fi^> and Mena ; and fings 

the praifes of fimplcs appropriated to the

difeafes of the fex : in which, both antient 
fuperftition, and modern belief, fupplied 
his mufe with exuberant fources of grati- 
fication. 

In the third/ Flora calls forth all his 
powers, in the narciflus, the anemone, the 
violet, and the tulip, with a variety of other 
ornaments of the parterre, from the coro- 
nary tribe. 

In tht fourth y a more numerous fet of 
the fubordinate embellilhments of the gar- 
den are recorded, in various meafure; among 
which, the attributes of the moly, the lily, 
poppy, funflower, faiFron, and amaranth^ 
attraft his mufe. with more than ordinary 
attention. 

In tht Jifth, he celebrates, in heroic mea- 
fure, the gifts of Pomona^ from the native 
produds of England^ to the date of the 
eaft, and the tuna of the weft ; terminating 
his poem with near two hundred lines on 
ColumbuSy on the Spaniards^ on the new 
continent, and in exprefling his hopes that, 
to the devaftations of conqueft, will foon 
fucceed peace, religion, arts, and fcience. 

In the lajiy he difplays the lylvan fcene, 

from 



Cowlef. . 2S5 

from the oak of Bofcobeh to the lowly juni-i 
per; and, having conftituted his druidical^ 
monarch the fovereign of the foreft, he 
makes him the oracle for a train of reflec- 
tions, on the ufurpation ; the exile of Charles 
the Second, his reftoration ; and the Dutch 
war.. 

His poems are accompanied by notes, 
lUuftrating the etymology, the names, fyno- 
nyms, defcriptions, faculties, and ufes of 
the plants, confirmed by authorities drawa 
from clafUcal, botanical, and medical wri- 
ters. Of thefe, he profefles in his preface, 
that Pliny among the antients, and Fer- 
NELius among the moderns, have been his 
chief refburces. Of botanical authors, Ge- 
rard and Parkinson are fparingly men- 
tioned, and they are the principal of that 
clafs. 

Great eminence in fcience is feldom at- 
tainable, unlefs its foundation be laid in a 
devotednefs of mind to its object, in the 
early fcene of life. Cowley did not enter 
on the ftudy of phyfic, till the middle age 
of man ; and then, as is probable, not with 
intercfled views towards praiftice. Hence 

it 



a86 . C H A >TE R 21. 

k may fairly be pi-eTumcd, that he latisÂ£id 
hicnfelf with moderate acquifition. What 
was true of the whole, may by fair analogy 
be applicable to a particular branch of it. 
He had doubtlefs that portion of knowlod^ 
in the materia medica of plants, which may 
be confidered as adequate to the ufual d^-? 
mand. 

But, that Cowley, in his retirement, 
fhould obtain an extenfive and critical know- 
ledge of botany, as it flood as a fcience, 
even in his day, could not be expe<aed. His 
fovid genius could fcarcely floop to that 
patient inveftigation of nature, by which 
alone it could be acquired. Neither do the 
text, nor the notes, manifeft fufficient proof 
of his intimate acquaintance with thofe au- 
thors of true fame, among the modems, 
through whofe afli fiance the want of thai 
information might, in fome meafiife, have 
been fupplied. 

Neverthelefs, as, in the language of Dr. 
Johnson, ** Botany, in the mind of Cow- 
** LEY, turned into poetry,'* to thofe who 
are alike enamoured with the charnos of 
both, the poems of Cowley mufl: yield 

delight J

adorned his {bbjci^ w:kh all the beaatifiii

modem Sigrmtores^ of Bajptista Porta,

with the parts of the human body, afliifte^ 
to embelliih his verfc* Nor did he fail, by 
thefe elegant prodaftions, to hohqur his 
inbjed:, his name, and his country. 

I ciofe thefe obfervations by remarking^ 
that poetry, -as it ever hath, fo it ever mjufl: 
<ierive from nature fome of its moft plcafing 
iccnes of entertainment. In the vegetable 
world, the moft expanded imagination of

dfiftinguifh, with fufficient accitracy, the 
j^)ccifes from varieties. He ranges the plantsf 
alphdbeticaHy, according to tht Latin names, 
and has given- few fynoriyms, except thbfe 
of Gerard and Parkinson ; to which, 
affer the example of the writers of the 
** Hortus Oxonienfisy^ he has very commen- 
dably annexed the page. He gives the ge- 
neral places of growth, and fpecifies thef 
particular fpots, wher6 the rare plants are 
found. 

At the end of the Catalogue, is fiibjoined, 
a rude difpofition of vegetables into clafles,

only varieties ; a number of exotics, evidently 
the accidental offspring of gardens, and 
many that could never be met with by 
fucceeding botanifts, in the places fpecified 
by him. He enumerates upwards of 1400 
fpecies of Englijh plants ^ whilft the accu- 
rate Mr. Ray, only three years afterwards, 
confines the number to 1050. Neverthe- 
lefs, feveral Britijh plants make their firft 
appearance in this Pinax ; and Dr. Mer- 
KET would probably have fecured his title 
to fome others, if he had not totally omitted 
to give defcriptions of thofe which he in- 
troduces as new. 

The zoological part of this Pinax is ex- 
extremely fuperficial ; confifting merely of 
the Latin and Engli/b name, with a refer- 
ence to Aldrovandus, Gesner, John- 
ston, and MouFFETT. The mineralogy 
is not lefs brief, and imperfed. 

Before the publication of this work. Dr. 
Merret had printed '* A Colle<aion of

jDOBERT Mori SON was born at ^ier-* 
deeriy in 1620 ; was educated in the 
fame univeriity; and, in 1638, took the de- 
gree of dodor in philofophy, equivalent to 
that of M. A. He firft applied to mathe- 
matics, and was defigned by his parents for 
the theological line ; but his tafte for bo- 
tany and phyfic fuperfeded their intentions. 
His attachment to the royal caufe, led him 
into the army ; and he received a dangerous 
wound in the head, in the battle at Brigg% 

near 



Mori/on. 299 

near Aberdeen. Updn his recovery, he went 
to Paris ^ the afylum of his countrymen* 
Here he was firfl employed as a tutor to 
the fon of a counfellor, Bizet ; and, in the 
mean time, afliduoufly applied to the ftudy 
of anatomy, botany, and zoology. In 1648, 
he took the doctor's degree in phyfic at 
Angers. He became fo much diftinguifhed 
by his fkill in botany, that at the recom- 
mendation of M. Robins, the king^s bota- 
nift, he was taken into the patronage of the 
Duke of Orleans, uncle to Lewis XIV. and 
appointed intendant of his fine garden at 
Blois, with a handfome falary. This eftab- 
Ufhment took place in 1650, ai)d ho held 
it until the death of the Duke, in 1660. 
Here, we are told, Mori son laid open to 
the Duke his method of botany ; and was 
liberally encouraged by him to profecute it. 
The Duke alfo fent him into various pro- 
vinces of France, to fearch for new plants, 
Jle travelled into Burgundy, the Lyonnois, and 
Languedoc *y znd into Britanny, the coafts 
and ifles of which he carefully inveftigated; 
and, by thefe journies, enriched the gardea 
with many rare^ and fome new plants.

It was in this fltuation that he becs^e 
known to Charles 11. who, in 1660, on the 
death of his uncle the Duke, invited Mo- 
RisoN into England i and, although folicitcd 
by the treafurer Fouquet^ on the moft ho- 
nourable and ample conditions, to remain 
in France^ the love of his country overcame 
all temptationis, and he returned to Â£Â«Â§â€¢- 
htnd. Charles IL gave him the title of^ 
king's phyfician, and royal profeflbr of bo- 
tany, with an appointment of 200I. a year, 
and a houfe, as fuperintendant of the royal 
gardens. He was eledted fellow of the 
Royal College of Phyficians, and acquired 
much fame for his knowledge of botany. 
Iri this fituation he remained till the year 
1669, when, having made an acquaintance 
with Mr. Obadiah Walker, of Univerfity 
College, with the Dean of Chrift Church, 
and other leading men of the, univerfity, 
he was, by their intereft, eleAed botanic 
|i>tQfcffor at Oxford, Dec. 16, 1669, and 
jneotpprated doftor of phyfie the day fol- 
lt>wing. He read his firft leSwre iri tbt

time of his* death, which was thought t$> 
have been occafioned by a bruife, r^c^ived 
by thp pole of a coach, in crpffing the ftreet^ 
Nov. 9, 1683. He died at his bouie iji

Seguier feems to have placed impro^

edition of the " Htirtus Bkfenjis^' which he 
gives as publiihed m the year 1635, whe^ 
MoRisoN muft have been only fifteen years

cal error ; but the book, in fa<3:> was thp 
work oi Abel Bruyner, phyfician to the

The ** HoRTUs Blesensis'* raifed the 
author's character, and' contributed, as the 
writer of his life obferves, to recommend 
him to the ftation he afterwards held at 
Oxford. It contains the rudiments of his 
method of claflification. He profefles to 
give a lift of 260 new plants j but many of 
them proved to be only varieties, and others, 
fuch as were well known before. There 
were, neverthelefs, fome new and rare plants, 
of exotic, as well as indigenous origin ; the 
latter, fuch as he had himfelf firft difco- 
vcred in France.

as they did not profefs to write a fyftem, ' 
are here too rigidly tried by rules, not in- 
vented when they wrote, and of coqfe- 
quence the validity of which they eould not 
have acknowledged. 

In a dialogue at the end of the ** Hortus 
Bkfenfisy' MoRisoN teaches, that the ge- 
nera of plants fhould be eftablifhed on cha- 
racters drawn from the fruit, and not on 
any feniible qualities, or fuppofed medicinal 
virtue. He alfo learnedly defends the doc- 
trine, that all vegetables arife from feed; 
a propofition not univerfally allowed ; the . 
doftrine of equivocal, or fpontaneous gene- 
ration, having, at that time, many advo- 
cates among the learned. 

Dr. MoRisoN, during his refidence in 
France^ in his occafional journies to Paris^ 
about the year 1658, became familiar in the 
family of Lord Hat TON, then refident at 
' St. Germains, and whofe fecond fon Charles 
was much attached to natural hiftory, and 
became a voluntary and zealous difciple of 
'our author. Sixteen years afterwards, Mr. 
Charles Hat ton fent over, at the author's

wa^s born in 1633. He became a Ci/iertian 
mpnk of Palermo, and was a man of lingu- 
lar and various erudition in natural hiftoiy. 
He vifited Cornea and Malta ; travelled into 
England, Holland, and Germany ', and wjls 
for fome time botanift to the Duke qf Tuf^

xrurious . works ; and died in 1704, He 
wrote on foflils ; but his botanical writings 
have greater originality, and were of high 
value. MoRisoN, after having caufcd the 
fcven laft plates to be re-engraved, pub- 
liflicd the work alluded to above, under the 
following title:

The plants defcribed and figured in this 
book, arc, moft of them, fuch as had not 
been noticed by foregoing authors. A few 
qf thefe are common to Britain^ The

ated, nor well engraven : but the work had 
its ufe, as containing fome plants of 'Sou- 
thern Europe y not to be met with in any 
other author ; and on this account derives 
fome value, to thofe who are curious in 
purfuing the hiftory of plants in the fcxual 
iyftem, as being quoted by LiNNJfeU's* 

As a fpecimen of his great work, medi- 
tated under the name of â€¢* Hijloria Plantar

here divided into nine orders, the genera of 
which are diftinguiflied by the figure of the 
feed, afTifled^ in fome of the fubdiviiions, 
by the form of the leaf. They are illuftra- 
ted by figures of 150 different feeds. 

The author has fubjoined what he names 
** Umbelliferous Plants, improperly fo cal-

in characfter and habit, except the Valerian^ 
from the natural clafs of which he treats. 

This fpecimen excited the attention of 
the learned, augmented Morison's patro- 
nage, both abroad and at home ; and en* 
couragcd him to profecute with vigour his 
great work, of which the firft volume came 
out under the following title: ** Plant a*

Mori/on^ ^o^ 

was ever written; butScHELMAMMER* tells 
us, that he faw the whole work perfed in 
the hands of the author. Mori son him- 
felf affigns, as a reafon for publiihing the 
Herbaceous Divifion firft, the greater mag- 
nitude of the undertaking, arifing from the 
vaft number, and confequent difficulty of 
finding proper diftincftions and characters ; 
and becaufe he was unwilling to leave the 
moft difficult and abftrufe part of his work 
behind him unfinifhed, as happened to De- 
LECHAMP, and John Bauhine. Unhap- 
pily, however, Morison's untimely death 
fubjeded his work to the fame lot, and did 
ftof allow him to finifli more than nine, out 
of the fifteen clafles of his own fyftem. 

He divides all herbaceous plants into fif- 
teen clafles, under the following titles : 

1. Scandentes. 7. Pappof^e LaSlefcenm 

2. Leguminof<e. tes. 

3. Siliquoja. 8. Culmifera.

From an infpeftion of this table, it ap- 
pears, that his method is not uniformly 
founded on the fruit ; in fadt, much lefs fo 
than that of Cjesalpinus ; but on the 
fruit and the habit conjointly; fince the 
Corymbifera^ Umbellifera^ and Galeata^ with 
the Verticillatcey arife from the difpofition 
of the flower; the Scandentes^ Culmifera^ 
and Capillaresy from the habit : the fcventh 
clafs from the qualities partly, and partly 
from the feed. Hence we fee, that only 
half the claflcs are founded on the fruit ; 
the fifteenth being truly an heteroclite 
afTemblage. His method would have ap- 
proached much nearer to perfedtion, on his 
own principles, had he enlarged the num- 
ber of his clafles; fince, in feveral inftances, 
they embrace natural orders, much too dif- 
tindt to be ranged together. The orders, 
or fubdivifions of the clafies, are, in fome 
inftances, grounded on differences in the 

feed- 



Morifon. 309 

feed-veflel ; in others, on the root, habit, 
and frequently on lefs fcientific difcrimina- 
tions. In the condud: of the work itfelf, 
Mori SON makes a feparate chapter for 
each genus â€¢ He begins by referring to the 
antients under each plant ; frequently fub- 
joining the etymology. The generical cha- 
raifters, if indeed they can be fo called, are 
very vague ; and though taken from the 
parts of frud;ification, are, too often, aflifted 
by diftindlions from the root, leaves^ and 
mode of growth. After the generical note, 
follows a fynoptical table of the fpecies, re- 
ferring to the plates. The defcriptions are 
fometimes borrowed from "John Bauhine . 
and others. To moft of the plants, he af- 
fixes new fpecific characters, and fubjoins 
^ ihtjynonyma of feveral authors. He intro^ 
duces, at the end of the chapters, the ani- 
madverfions on the Bauhjnes, and an ac-s^ 
cpunt of the virtues and ufes of the plants. 

The five firft clafles only, were publiflied 
by the author, who left the four fucceeding 
ones finifhcd. Thefe, with the remaining . 
clafles, were finifhed and published, after 
SO interval of nineteen years, by Jacob Bo-

BART. MoRisoN had the, advantage of 
powerful patronage. He was liberally en- 
couraged by the univeriity, and enabled to 
embellifli his work with a numerous fct 
of tables, on which are engraven about 
3384 plants. The figures are chiefly co^ 
pied from other authors. The new figures 
occur principally in the latter part of this 
work, and are therefore to be attributed to 
the care of Bdbart. The fix tables of 
Mojfes^ Fuciy Corallines^ and Corals^ at the 
(end, are, except the few wooden cuts of Ge- 
rard, the firft of the kind graved in Eng-^ 
landy and have great merit as the produc- 
tions of that time. All thofe of Column A 
and CoRNUTus are copied in this work, 
Thofe engraved by Burghers excel the reft i 
and the figures of the grafles and mofl^es are 
incomparably beyond any other that are to 
be met with, on the fame fcale j the habit 
being admirably well expreffed. The re- 
publication of thefe tables, with leferences 
to LiNN-Â«us's writings, would, even at 
this period, be a benefit to the fcience.

In the preface, which is figned Jacob Bo- 
bar t, the reader is prcfented with a gene- 
ral view of the writers on botany, from 
Theophrastus, to the time of Mori - 
SON ; enumerating throughout the feveral 
nations of Europe^ in a chronological order, 
the moft learned authors on the fubjecS. The 
Writer then informs us of the patronage and 
encouragement which Mori son received 
from the univerfity, to undertake this work; 
and, after lamenting the untimely death of 
the author, and expreffing his grateful fenfe 
of the honour he received in being ap- 
pointed to continue the undertaking, he lays 
before the reader the affiftances he received 
in the profecution of it. An interval of 
near twenty years had given Bobart an 
opportunity of inferting a great number of 
plants unknown to Morison, from the 
works of Ray, Herman, Pl.ukenet, the 
^^ Hortus Malabarkus^' and other works.

METHOD. 

AGREEABLY to my purpofc, I 
now proceed to give a concife ac- 
count of the rife and progrcfs of what is 
tjnderftood by methody ^fiem, or claffification 
of plants, arifing from agreement in the 
parts of fructification, independent of any 
aflbciation ^from iht fades externa^ or habit 
of the plant. To this, I fhall add as brief 
an hiftory of another important difcovery, 
that of the fexes of plants ; in confequence 
pf which, fyftem itfelf has been carried to 
^ much higher degree of perfcdion. 

There are no traces of what the modefns 

call 



Method. 31^ 

C2MJyJiemy in the writings of the anticnts i 
by whom are pre-eminently fignified, Theqp^ 
PHRASTUs, DioscoRiDEs, and Pliny. 
Their knowledge of vegetables was con- 
fined to a few that were ufed in medicine, 
and in the arts and conveniences of life; and 
in treating on them, their fubjetfts are placed 
in great and inordinate divifions, w^ithout 
the fmalleft approach to what is now meant 
by chjjification. 

Theophrastus treats his fubjedl, in 
general, philofophically. In his book " De 
Caujis Plantarum^"* he confiders the propa^ 
gation, culture, qualities, and ufes of Plants 
in general ; but defcribes very few. In his 
*^ Hijioria Flantaruniy' in which are de* 
fcribed, or enumerated, about 500 fpecies., 
he begins with the organization, the gene.-^. 
ration, and propagation of Vegetables^ He 
then treats largely, in his third and fourth 
books, on Trees ^ In ihcjifthy on Timber, 
and the choice of the beft, In xhtfxth^ 
on Shrubs, thorny Plants, Rofes, and other 
ornaments of gardens. In iht feventh^ oi) 
oleraceous Plants, and wild Plants. In thq 
eighth^ copioufly on Grain of all kinds.

And in the laji^ on Gums, Exudations, and 
the methods of obtaining them. 

Theobjea of Dios cor ides being folely 
\xk Materia Medicay he difcufles each fuo- 
jeft fpecifically, and in a feparate chapter, 
dividing the whole into five books \ in w^hich, 
as far as any order takes place, they arrange 
into aromatic, alimentary, and medicinal 
plants. His defcriptions are taken chiefly 
from colour, fize, mode of growing, com- 
parifon of the leaves and roots, with other 
plants well known, and therefore left unde-- 
fcribcd. In general they are (hort, and fre- 
quently infufBcient to determine the fpecies. 
Hence arofe the endlefs, and irreconcileable 
contentions, among the commentators. In 
this manner he has defcribed near 700 
plants ; to which he fubjqins the virtues 
and ufes. . To Dioscorides all pofterity 
have appealed as decifive on the fubjedt, 

Pliny, who treats of plants from the 
twelfth to the twenty-feventh book, inclu-f 
five, of his ** Hiftory,'' has drawn his rcr 
fources principally from Grecian authors. 
He is the hiflorian of antient botany, and 
recites the names pf feveral hundreds, not 

rr^entioned

mentioned by foregoing writers ; but many 
of thefe are unknown. There is no fcicn- 
tific order in the difpofition of his fub- 
je(3: ; and the great value of Pliny's work 
confifts in having preferved to us the re- 
mains of antient knowledge on the fubjedt; 
and in particular, the application of it to 
the arts of life, in thofe remote times. 

After the Revival of learning in the fif- 
teenth century, the firft cultivators of bd- 
tany ftudied plants more in the writings of 
thefe fathers, than in the book of nature; 
and were folely anxious about extricating 
the plants of the Materia Medica ; fcarcely 
adverting to thofe ftriking difcriminations 
in the general port, mein, or habit, the 
mode of growing, and other obvious rela- 
tions, which mark the great natural fami* 
lies in the vegetable kingdom : but were con- 
tent to arrange them, fome, according to the 
alphabetical nomenclature, others, from the 
ftrudture of the root, the time of flowering, 
the places of growth, the fuppofed qualities, 
and ufes in medicine ; or from other as un- 
liable diftindtions. With them, as with 
the antients, there were nearly as many ge-- 

nera 



3l8 CHAPTER 24* 

nera z'^ /pedes i and if they gave the fame 
common appellation to two, or more plants, 
they were led to it by fomc rude, external 
refcmblance; fuch as, fize, form of the root, 
agreement in the colour of the flower; and^ 
in the defcription of the fpecies, were fre- 
quently fatisficd with comparing it to an- 
other plant well known to themfelves, and 
therefore left undefcribed in their writings. 

This mode of arrangement, though in a 
ibmewhat improved ftate, is exemplified 
above, in the order obferved by Dodon^eus i 
and is fcen in our old Englijh herbalifts> 
Gerard and Parkinson. 

Lob EL, in his Adverfaria, 1 570, feems to 
have been the firft, who attempted to dif- 
tribute plants into large families, or clafles, 
from the general confent of habit, or exter- 
nal form, and mode of growing. This ho 
has done in an imperfect fynoptical way; 
and- feveral of his families contain natural 
orders, or clafles, nearly entire; but fre- 
quently interrupted by great anomalies. His 
arrangement was not fufficiently attended 
to at the time : it was then excellent, and 
was gradually improved, until we fee it in 

its 



Method. 515 

itt laft, and beft forfn, as exhibited by 
Cafpar Bauhime, in his Pinaky 1623 j and 
cTpccially by Jolm Baithinb, in his Hijio^ 
ria Plantarum XJniverfalisy 1650. 

As natural charaders arofe from fimila^ 
rity in the general port, or habit of the 
plant, tnd from an obvious agreement in 
the difpoiition of the ftalk, leaves, ftemsi 
and from that of the flower, fruit, and feedj 
fo, they at length forced themfelves to ob- 
fervation. Thus, the general habit of all 
grajfes ; the plants with a papilionaceous 
flower, fuch as peafe apd vetches ; the^//- 
^o/e phntSy fuch as muftard, creiTes, tur- 
neps, &c, ; the verticillatedy as mint, baum, 
hyflbp, germander, &c. ; the umbellated tv'ibty 
parfley, carrots, hemlock, angelica; the 
com-bearing trees ^ and feveral other tribes, 
were too ftriking, not to be feen even by a 
fuperficial obferver. But, as thefe conftitute 
only a part of the whole, fo no charaders 
were formed for thofe plants, which the eye 
could not immediately refer to fome of 
thefe claffes. Still lefs had any generical 
agreement, arifing from uniformity in th6 
fruftification, been detefted. Had all the 
fpecies of plants arranged themfelves under 

natural 



320 CHAPTER 24* 

natural clafTes^ a natural method would 
cafily have followed ; but the intermediate 
jiiEiks, notwithflanding the efforts of the 
mofl fkilful, are yet unknown. Hence arofe 
jhe neceflity of artificial fyftems, which are 
now become but too numerous. Some h^ve 
imagined^ that the more pure any artificial 
^flem prefcrvcs the natural clafTes, the 
greater is its excellence; but experience 
does not confirm this idea. Thofe arrange- 
ments are found to lead more immediately 
to the plant fought for, the clafTcs and 
fubdivifions of which are fimple, apd drawn 
each uniformly from the fame parts of the 
frudtification* 

. Conrad Ges^e?., the LiNN-ffius of the 
age in which he lived, is univerfally agreed 
to have been the firfl who fuggefled this 
true principle of claffical diflindlion, and 
generical charader, as is manifeft from va- 
rious pafTages in the Epijiles of that great 
man *. He inflances the agreement of the 
Staphifagria, with the Confolida ; the Scor^

with the Lamiumi the Dulcamara^ with

the Solanufh ; the Calceolus, with the Orcbi^ 
des : and he exprefsly fays> that the charac- 
ter fhould be formed from the flower, and 
the feed, rather than from the leaves. This 
Was in the year 1 565. Othe^ paflages occiir, 
by which it appears, he had the fame ideas 
fo early as 1559. But, perhaps, there is 
no proof of the importance he gaVe to thefe 
parts, more indubitable, than his having 
been the firft who delineated them fepa- 
rately, with the figures of his plants ; of 
which numerous inftarices may be fcen in 
the tables publifhed byScHMiEDEL, 

But Gesner did not live to improve the 
hints he thus drew from naturej and, what 
is wonderful, they were negleAed by thofe 
great luminaries of the icience, Clusius> 
and the Bauhines* It was referved for 
C^ SAL PIN us, a man in whoiii was united 
an exquifite knowledge of plants, with a 
truly philofophical genius. He had been 
the difciplc of Ghinus, and was afterwards 
phyfician to Pope Clement Vlll. He de- 
fcribed, with exquifite fkill, the plants of 
his own country, and left an Herbarium of 

Vol. i; y 768

768 fpecies. He extended GESNER'g idea^ 
and commenced the period of fyftematic 
arrangement. In his ** Libri xvi de Plan^ 
tis^^ publifhed 1583, he has arranged up- 
wards of 800 plants into clajfes^ founded, 
after the general divifion of the trees from 
herbs, on characters drawn from the fruit 
particularly, from the number of the cap- 
fules and cells ; the number, fliape, and dif- 
pofition of the feeds 5 and from the fituation 
of the corculum^ radicle^ or eye of the feed, 
which he raifed to great eftimation. The 
orders J or fubdivifions, are formed on ftill 
more various relations. 

F^i^m Column A improved this dodrinc 
oi clajjification^ in 1616, by extending it to 
the formation oi genera, which Cjesalpi- 
Nus had not efFeded; all his fpecies being 
feparately defcribed. Column A, indeed, 
did not exhibit a fyftem; but he fhewcd the 
way to complete it, by the union of ipecies 
under one common name, from fimilarity 
in the flower, and friiit; and he invented 
feveral of thf teims, now in ufe, to deno- 
minate thofe parts. This noble invention, 

neverthelefs. 



Method. 323 

neverthelefs, lay dormant for near a cen- 
tury; and the glory of reviving^ and im- 
proving it, was referved for Britain. 

Ray, and Morison, both laboured in it 
at the fame time; and with them muft 
commence the aera of lyftematic botany ia 
England. It was an objefit thought worth 
contending for, and each of thefe writers 
had their partizans, who refpedtively be- 
flowed the laurel, as they were led by their 
various motives, or attachments. I ihall 
not enter into the merits of their claims, 
further than to obferve, that both feem to 
have turned their attention to the fubjedt, 
nearly about the fame time, and that Mr. 
Ray had certainly priority in point of 
publication, if it may be allowed, that the 
tables which he drew up for Bifliop Wil- 
kin s's " Real or. Univerfal Charafter,'* 
which was publifhed in 1668, contain the 
outlines of a fyftem. And, certainly, thefe 
rudiments, though haftily done, as Mr. Ray 
confefTes, fufficiently prove that he had be- 
ftowed no fmall attention on the fubjedt. 
That foreign writers have more commonly 
attributed to Morison the revival x>f me- 
Y a*. ^ thod, 



324 CHAPTER 24. 

thod, may have arifen from their being lefs 
acquainted with Bifliop Wilkins's work, 
which was extant only in th^EngliJh tongue. 
Mr. Ray informs us, in the fecond edition 
of his Catalogus Plantarum Anglian that 
Dr. WiLKiNs meditated a tranflation of 
his " Univerfal Charader" into Latin^ with 
figures, for the ufe of foreigners ; and Mr. 
Ray himfelf performed it : but the death 
of this good prelate, in 1672, prevented the 
completion of the defign. He adds, that his 
Method, in a more elaborate ftate, had been 
delivered into the Bifhop's hands, for the 
above-mentioned work. 

Dr. Mori SON exhibited the outlines of 
his fcheme in the ** Hortus Blefenfis,'* the 
year after the publication of the Bifliop's 
book, and exemplified it in his " Hiftory of 
" Plants," in 1680. Mr. Ray did not de- 
tail his till the year 1682, in the " Metho^ 
dus,'' in which he freely acknowledges the 
afljftance he received from C-ffiSALPiNus, 
CoLUMNA, JuNGius, and even from Mo- 
rison's work. On the contrary. Dr. 
Mori SON afllimes to himfelf the merit of 
haying drawn all Ijis rcfources, in the fa- 
brication

bricatlon of his fyftem, wholly from na- 
ture, and his own obfervations ; preferving 
every where the utmoft filence, refpe<3:ing 
any affiftance derived from former writers. 
Aflumptions, which could with difficulty 
be acceded to, and which drew upon him 
the cenfures of Tournefort, and other 
mafters of the/cience 5 who were Well ac- 
quainted with the fountains of knowledge 
that were then open to him, and the affift- 
ances he muft have drawn from Gesner, 
Cjesalpinus, and others. 

At this diftance of time, and under the 
prefent enlightened ftate of fcience, the lyf- 
tems of Ray, and of Morison, muft not 
be fcrupuloufly examined. C-Â«salpinus 
laid a foundation-ftone, on which, if our 
Britijh architcSs raifed a Gothic ftru<fture> 
their fucceifors have improved it to a ftyle 
of greater fymmetry, and elegance. 
' The introdudtion oi fyftem was fortunate 
for fcience> as it brought with it, by de- 
grees, the eftabliihment of generical cha- 
radlers, on a like aflemblage of eflential 
parts in feveral fpecies. As new plants 

Y 3 werc^ 



326 CHAPTER 24* 

were daily difcovcrcd in the old continent, 
and were pouring in from the new, the 
nomenclature of botany was in danger of 
being again overwhelmed, with -that chaos 
in which Cafpar Bauhine found it, when 
he reduced it into fome order, by hi& la- 
. borious and incomparable Pinax. 

Syjiem enabled Ijotanifts to refer new fpc-- 
cies to genera already formed, and reftraincd 
that licence before taken, of giviag a new 
generical appellation to each new plant : 
for, although in the multitude of methods 
which. follo\Yed this difcovery, plants of the 
fame genus, in one fyftem, were frequently 
referable to a di6?erent genus in another i 
yet, with this inconvenience annexed, they 
were more readily inveftigated, than under 
the vague diftindlions of the older writers. 

The reftoration c^ Jyjiem^ was, in the 
words of LiNN^us, the beginning of the 
golden age of botany ; and the revival of it 
having taken place in England^ prefently 
raifed up feveral learned men among us, who 
gave new life and vigour to the whole fci- 
cnce. The names of Sloane, P^uke- 

NET, 



Method. 327 

NET, Sherard, and Petiver, will ever 
remain illuftrious in the annals of botanic 
knowledge.* . 

Jt alfo turned the attention of the learned 
on the continent to the fubjed. Rival fyf- 
terns were foon tonftrudted ; fome on the 
fruitf as the bafis of the claffes, in confor- 
mity to the fyftems of C^salpinus, Ray, 
and Mori SON ; and others, on tht Jlower. 
Thus, Chrtfiopher Knaut, in 1687, and 
Herman, in 1690, fixed on the Jriat ; 
whofe fyftems were improved by Boer- 
HAAVE, in 1710. 

RiviNUS, in 1690, chofe the flower 
alone ; confidering the number and regula-^ 
rity of the petals^ as the bafe of his claffical 
characters â€¢; and was followed by Ruppius 
in I7i8,and LuDwiG in 1737. Tourne- 
FORT, who elaborated his method beyond 
his predecefTors, in 1694, chofe the figure 
of the corolla^ as the principle of claffijica^ 
tion I and Magnol, in 1720, took the ca-^ 
iyx alone. 

If it fhould be enquired on this occafion, 

in what the methods of C^salpinus, 

Ray, and Morison, differ from the ar-

TO the revival and eftablifliment of

higheft importance to botanical fcience;^ 
J mean, what is, v^ith great juftice, called 
analogically. The doftrine of the fexes of 
plants i or, the knowledge that, throughout 
the vegetable kingdom, the influence of the 
duft of ^^-anther^^ upon th^Jihmay was 
neceflary in order to produce fertile feed. 
By the eftablifliment of this fad:, not only 
the phyfiology of vegetables was greatly 
advanced, but, in the end, pradical botany 
equally improved; fince, on this foundation 
l^as been built that fyftem of the great

Swede^ which is now (b univerfally followed^ 
Of the rife and progrefs of this inveftigation, 
I proceed to give a concife account, before 
I purfue the fketch oi Britijh authors. 

A vagiie and indecifive opinion concern-* 
Jng Uti^fexes of plants, prevailed among the 
antieht philofophers of Greece. We are in- 
formed by Aristotle, that Empedo- 
CLES particularly taught, â€¢* that the fexes 
** were united in plants." This opinion 
was a natural confequence of the dodrine 
which this philofopher, in common with 
AnAxagoras, Democritus, and Pla- 
to taught, *â€¢ that plants were fentient and 
*^ animated beings." This idea has met 
with ingenious advocates among the mo- 
derns, who have been induced to favour it, 
not only from the general analogy exifting 
between animals and vegetables, and the 
difficulty of fixing the limits between rficm, 
but from the more ftriking inftances of ap- 
parent irritability, and obedience to the 
aftion oi ctYt^mJiimuli: fuchare,.the gene- 
ral afFedtion plants have for light; the rota- 
tory motion of many towards the fun ; the 
faculty of others in clofing the leaves

many flovsrers, at ftated times, with equal 
propriety denominated vigilia jkrum ; the 
^ rifing of the flower of aquatic plants out 
of the water, every naorning during the ftate 
of florefcence, as inftanced in the Nym^ 
pkaa^ and ftill more fignally in the Vallif* 
neria. To thcfe may be added the more 
remarkable examples in the Mimofa, and 
Oxalis fenfitiva^ in the Dioncea mufcipula^ 
the Drofera and the Hedyfarum gyrans^ and 
finally, in the exquifite irritability of the 
Jiaminaf and anther a, in various fpecies* 
Empedocles, nevertherlefs, though he 
maintained the doftrine of the fexes, does 
not attempt to confirm it by any fadls, or 
reafonings deduced from the knowledge of 
the ufes of the feparate parts in flowers, but 
from a:nalogical dedudtion, founded merely 
on his general doftrine^ 

Aristotle, or rather the author of the 
Books on Plants, which bear his name, com* 
bats the opinions of Empedocles, and his 
followers, refpeifting the fentient and ani- 
mated principle in vegetables ; yet it is evi- 
dent

dent he had himfclf no decifivc Idea$^ or 
fpecific knowledge, drawn from nature, re- 
lating to th^fex of plants. He placed it, 
in fome inftances, in the different habit 
alone, or in other difcriminations foreign 
to the confideration of the flower; and, 
though he fliews an inaccurate knowledge 
of the particular circumftances of the palm, 
and the 6g-tree, yet he denies, in another 
place, that either of them produce flowers. 
This imperfedl idea of ihtfex of flowers, 
in the Date, and even in the Fig-tree, is of 
high antiquity ; being recorded by Hero- 
dotus, Theophrastus, and Pliny. 
The neceffity which the antient cultiva-" 
tors of the Date-tree were under, of pro- 
moting the adtion of the male-flowers on the 
female, which operation, held alfo in fome 
mcafiire in theF/^-/r^^, th^PiJiachia, and the 
Majlic, would almoft neceflarily fuggeft the 
application of this analogy with the animal 
kingdom. Nevcrthelefs, although the faft 
was thus obtruded on their fenfes, inatjen-f 
tive to the fl:rudlure of flowers, and igno- 
rant of the offices of the feveral parts, they 
remained ui^cquainted with the true ope-

though daily prefent to their obfervation* 

The antient fathers of botany, and par^ 
ticularlyDioscoRiDES, it is true, applied 
the diftindlion of male and female to many, 
other plants; but it was entirely without 
regard to true analogy, or difcrimination of 
fundlions in the flower. . It was frequently 
applied to fuch as carry all the parts of the 
flower within the^fame calyx ^ or on the fame 
ilalk ; on account of ftature ; greater de-

the latter, as is obferved in the Date-tree^

genial effluvium^ which excites a ftronger 
fertility. From this obfervation, it may 
almoft be inferred, that he had inftituted 
experiments on fbme of thefe kinds; but 
we do not find that he carried the idea beÂ«Â«

Adam Zaluziansky, a Polijh writer in 
1592, is faid, by fome, \o have diftin-* 
guifhed xhtfexes of plants. I have not feen 
his book 5 but, from v^rhat is found relating 
to his opinion in other writers, I conjedlure 
that his obfervations, if not wholly taken 
from Cjesalpinus, do not exhibit any- 
original matter on this fubjedt. In faÂ£t, 
no further progrefs was made for near an 
hundred years after this time ; and the hoÂ«

*â€¢ cefs was univerfal in the vegetable king-

Whether the true idea of this procefs 
-originated with Sir Thomas Milling ton, 
to whom it has been afcribed, may juftly 
admit of a doubt ; fince Sir Thomas has left 
no written teftimony on the fubjedt; and 
Dr. Grew's mention of him does not im- 
ply that he aftually received the idea from 
him. Add to this, that Mr. Ray, in the 
fummary view of all Grew's difcoveries, 
which he has prefixed to his '* Hiftory of 
" Plants,*' does not once mention Sir Tho^ 
mas Millington's name. Interefted as 
we muft fuppofe Mr. Ray to have been, 
in every difcovery relating to vegetables, 
and candid as he was in his general con- 
dud to the learned, it is not likely that he 
ihould have failed, in this inftance, to ren- 
der praife where it was fo juftly due. When 
we further recoiled:, that Dr. Grew had 
been fome years engaged in thofe micro- 
fcopical experiments, on the anatomy of 
plants, which have rendered his name cfti- 
mable with all pofterity, that whilft he was 
thus employed in ftudying fo intimately

that the true idea of its ufe fhould hav6 
been fuggefted to hittii 

Dr. Grew laid his opinion before th^ 
Royal Society, in a ledure on the anatomy 
of flowers, read Nov, 6, 1676 j in which 
he maintained^ ** That the primary and 
â€¢* chief ufe (of the duft of the apices) is

** with our learned Savilian profeflbr, Sir 
*' Thomas Millington, he told me, that 
** he conceived that the attire doth ferve 
** as the male for the generation of the 

feed. I immediately replied, that I was 

of the fame opinion, gaVe him fbme rea- 
** fons for it, and anfwered fome objections 
'^ that might oppofe them/* He then ex-

this fcecundating power was not effede^ by

Mr. Ray admitted the opinion pf Dr^ 
Grew, but, at firft, with all that caution 
which becomes a philofopher ; as appears in 
his ^^ HifioriaPlantarumy* vol. i. p. 18. Nos

and in the preface to. his ^^ Syllog^ Stkpium 
Europaanum^** published in 1694^ we find 
him producing his reafons for the truth of it, 
and yielding his full approbation to it. 

In 1695, Rudolph Ji^ok Cambharius, 
profcflbr of botany and phyfic at Tubmgen^ 
in his ** Epiftola de Sexu Flantarumx ap- 
pears among the eady advoi^es for this 
analogy; and, being amvioiced by tJbe argu- 
ments of QaÂ«w and Ray, &en]i3 to have 
beqn the firft who gave ftability to the 
whole by q&periments. Thefe he n^c 
pa Maasâ‚¬^ the Mulberry ^ the Rkmus^ and

deprived of the ftaminiferous flowers, and 
the laft he fcparated far from the female, 
and found, in all, that the fruit did not ri- 
pen. Camerarius, however, very fairly 
produces alfo, fome objedlions againft the 
dbdlrine, founded pn experiments, which at 
this day have little weight, fince they were 
made on plants of the Ctyptogamous^ orD/- 
oecious clafles ; in the laft of which, it is 
jiow known, that fometimes a flower or two 
of a different fex, may be found intermixed 
with others. 

In 1703, Mr. Samuel Morland, de- 
firous, as it fhould feem, of extending thd 
Lewenhoekian fyftem of generation into the 
vegetable kingdom, produced a paper before 
the Royal Society^ in which he advancesâ€” 
that the farina is a congeries of feminal 
plants, one of which muft be conveyed 
through the ftyle into every (?*i;Â«/^, or feed, 
before it can become prolific. Mr. Mor- 
land's hypothefis tended to confirm the 
general dod:rine by exciting curiofity on 
the fubjed, at a time when Lenjoenhoek'^ 
theory was popular;- but was not admiflible 
in itfeM> fince few ftyles are hollow, or, if 
Z 2 perceptibly 



340 CHAPTER 25. 

perceptibly tubular, not pervious enough to 
admit particles of the ufual magnitude of 
xhQ farina. 

After this time, feveral of the learned on 
the continent entered into refearches on this 
fubjeft. M. Geoffroy, in 171 1, in a 
paper read before the Royal Academy ofSci^ 
^ncesy after having formed a theory by con- 
ciliating Grew's and Morland's into 
one, concludes by afferting â€” that the germ 
is never to be kitw in the feed, till "the^- , 
Ttna is fhed; and that if the plant is de-. 
prived of thQ Jiamina^ before this duft is 
fallen, the feed will either not ripen, or will 
not prove fertile. 

It is matter of furprize, that the illuf-,- 
trious TouRNEFORT fhould wholly rejedl. 
the dodlrine of the /exes of plants. So far ; 
even from acknowledging this fundtion of 
the farina y that he held it to be excremen- 
titious . See Ifagoge in Rem Herbariam, p. 70. 

Julius PoNTEDERA, a ftrenuous fol- 
lower of TouRNEFORT, a uoblc Italian of 
Pifa, illuftrious for his knowledge of the aji- 
tient languages, and antiquities of Italy ^ and 
not lefs celebrated for botanical knowledge

and literature, combats dlfo the notion of 
this analogy, and ufes oi th^ Jiamina^ through 
the whole fecond book of his ^^Anthologia,"* 
In ^he end he rejects the fexual analogy, and 
-confiders it as entirely chimerical. But 
â€¢finding all flowers furnifhed with a ftyle, 
or tube, he advances, that it ferves to con- 
vey- the air to the fruit, by which, an intefr 
tine and fertilizing motion is excited in the 
feed, or ovary. 

In 171 8, Monf. Va ill ant publiflied 
^* ^ermo de StruSlura Florum^.borum Diffe^ 
rentia^ ufuque Partiumi' which had been 
read the year before, at the opening of the 
Royal Garden. In this difcourfe, he de- 
fcribes the burfting of the antheray in a ftyle 
too florid for philofophical narration. He 
relates feveral of his own difcoveries on the 
nature of the farina^ and the exploding 
power of the antherce, and concludes with 
aflenting entirely to Dr. Grew's fentiment, 
(though without naming him), that imÂ«. 
pregnation is performed by means of a fubtle 
auray and not by the tranfmiflion of the duft 
through the ftyle, alledging againft it thofe 
Z 3 reafonj 



34^ CHAPTER 25. 

reaibns I have mentioned, in fpeaking of 
Morland's opinion. 

In England^ about the fame time. Dr. 
Patrick Blair, by his ^* Botanick ElTays," 
contributed greatly to extend the know- 
ledge, and confirm the truth of this fubjed:. 
Bradley, Fairchild, Miller,, and 
others, afUfled in the fame defign; and, 
iince that period, I believe it has met witb 
few oppofers. One of jthe moft formidable 
was the late learned Dr. Aljton^ profeffor of 
botany at Edinburgh^ from whofe laboured 
difquifition, the adverfaries to this opinion 
of the fex of flowers, may furnilh them- 
felves with the moil cogent arguments, that 
an intimate knowledge of the fubjedt hath 
enabled a very diligent and learned writer 
to produce. 

The more recent experiments made by 
the Abbe Spalanssani, with a direft view 
to impugn this dodtrine^ do not appear to 
have been conduced with that degree of 
ikill, and accuracy, which is fufficient to 
outweigh the numerous train that may 
be thrown into the oppofite fcale. Even 

Â» fome 



Stx of Plants â€¢ 343 

fomc of the Abbe's owh experiments icem 
rather to ftrerlgthen the opinion he meanlB 
to overthrow. 

Having traced the hiiiory of this import 
tant procefs in the economy of vegetables, 
to the time of Linn^us, I jud^e it will 
be urtnfeceffary, to accompany the reader 
through a particular detail of authors below 
this period. In 1732, LiNN-ffius founded 
his fyftem on this dod:rine; and the addi- 
tidilal arguments, and e3tperin>entSy produced 
by himfelfi his pupils, and followers, hav6 
eftablifhed the truth of it, to the complestt 
fatisfadlion of impartial enquirers. Thofe^ 
however, who wifh to perufe the moft per- 
fcA fummary of all the arguments, and ex- 
J)erimerits, in favour of this analogy, are 
referred to the " SponfatiaPlantarum^'* wriu 
ten in the year 1746, and printed in the 
firft volume of the " Amamitates Academic 
ccBj' and to the " Diflertation on the Sexes 
** of Planits,'* written by Linn^ us in 
i76oy which obtained the premium of the 
Academy of Petetjburgby and has lately 
been tranfkted into Englijh by the ingenious 
and Icirned pofieffor of the Linn^an collec-

tion. To which may be added, the wriÂ« 
tings of KoELRUTER, in the fucceeding 
year, which have not a little tended to 
cpnftrm the fubjedt in queftion. 

It would be unjuflr to the memory of Dr. 
Grew, tp conclude this hiftory, without 
remarking, that the rcfult of the lateft, and 
beil experiment$, have ponfirmed his idea, 
'^ that xht farina itfelf is not carried ^o the 
*' rudiment of the feed,'* but, that foecun- 
dation is tSc&tdi by the effluvia. This 
will appear, by citing the funxmary view 
of the dodtrine, as exhibited by Linn je us 
himfelf, in the Difjertation above men^ 
tioned, 

^V While plants arc in flower, the foJkn 
^* falls froni the anther ay and is difperfed 
** al)road. At the fame time that tht pollen 
f is fcattered, the Jiigma is then in its 
** higheft vigour, and for a portion of the 
^* day at leafl is moillened with a fine dew. 
" The pollen eafily finds accefs to the^/^- 
" may where it not pnly adheres by means 
" of the dew of the part, but the moifture 
** occfafions its burfting, by which means 
]^ its contents ar? difcharged. What ifl^^

^ from it beiiig mixed with the ^ufd of 
^' the Jiigma, is convejred to the rudiments

I remark before I conclude, that, how 
juft foevcr it may have been in a philofb- 
phical view, to confider the ftamina and 
fijiils^ as anfwering to the reljpe<ftive func- 
tions of fex in the animal kingdom, it 
ftiould not have been forgotten, that -in ani- 
mals, this procefs is voluntary; but that 
in vegetables, notwithftanding all that the 
ingenuity of the antients and moderns have 
urged in defence of the fentient principle, 
we are nol yet juilified in referring this pro- 
cefs to any other than what we are accu(^ 
tomed to cal} a mechanical caufe^ 

The principle of this it will not be ex- 
pected that I ihould explain. It may be 
conjeftured, that after a perfedt elaboration 
of the juices in the anther a and Jiigmata^ 
fome fpecies of attr^ftion takes place be- 
tween them, perhaps of the eleftrical kind, 
fomewhat like this having been manifefted 
in the flafhings obfervable in fome flowers 
in the evenings. The reader will eafily 
perceive, that I refer to the appearance firft

IT is not to the fons of erudition alone, 
that botany is indebted for all its difco^

plants has, not unfrequently, feized, with

learning withhold that praife which is fo 
juftly due. One pf the moft remarkable 
inftances of this kind> is well known t9 
thofe who are converfant with the writings 
pf Merret, Ray, and Morison ; and I 
feel regret at ijot being able tQ commemOf 
rate the name of Thomas Willisel^ with 
.ibme of the circumilances of his life 3 finc^ 
I ana uninformed of the tknc, and place, 
-totb of his birth, and of his death. This 
induilrious man feems to have devoted 
much of his life to the inveftigation oSEng^ 
BJh plants; and^ as he l;ved at a time when 
Britijh botany was yet imperfed, he added 
largely to the flock of new difcoveries. He 
iRras employed by Dr. MoRisftN, fboii after 
his eftabliftunent at Oxford, to coHeft rare 
Englijh plants; .and Dr. Me r ret info|-mÂ§ 
us, a5 hath been noticed, that he travelled

ferc^t parts oi England, to make coUeSions 
for his " Pinax ;'* which appears to have 
]been greatly enriched with many of the moft 
fare fpecies, by the labours of Willisel, 

J believQ 



I believe he was once .fent into Ireland by 
Dr. Sherard. Mr* Ray was benefited 
by his refearches; and, if I do not miftake, 
he accompanied that celebrated n^tufalifl: 
in one of his tours. The emolument arifing- 
from thefe employments was probably 4- 
mong the principal means of his fabUft- 
ence. 

His knowledge was not confined to the 
vegetable kingdom; fince Mr. 'Ray m^ 
forms us, that ^* he was employed by the 
Royal Society in the iearch of natural ra- >

In the " Natural Hiftory of Cornwa//,*'- 
by William Borlace^ A.M. F.R.S. Ox-

containing about thirty-eight land plants, 
and twentyyi/r/, with fomc fcattered remarks 
on the qualities and ufcs. Among the rare 
plants are the Verticillate Knotgrafs, the^ 
Roman Nettle, the Gunhilly Heath, and the 
Cornifh Pennywort; of which laft there is 
^ very indifferent figure in tab, 29. f. 6. 
Under the article Sun-dew, (DroferaJ there 
is a curious and interefUng obfervation made 
by Dr. Borlace, in which he aflerts, that 
the well-known pernicious quality of that 
vegetable, in producing the rot among flaeep, 
where it abounds-, does npt strife from any 
cauftic power in the vegetable, but frqm an

As I do not ilridtly confine myfelf to 
iUch writers, as have diflinguiflied themÂ« 
felves by their difcovcries in the indigenous 
botany of Brkain^ alone, I cannot therefore 
omit to mention lb eminent a man as Sir 
George Wheler. He was the fon of 
Col. Wheler, of Chafing^ in Kent y and 
was born in 1650, at Breda^ his parents 
being there in exile with the royal ^mily. 
At the age of feventeen, he became a comÂ« 
ftioner oi Lincoln College ^ OxjfbrJ; and, be- 
fore he took any degree, went on his tra- 
vels. He fpent near two years in France^ 
and Jtafy i and, in 1675, travelled into 
Greece and AJia Minor i from whence he 
returned in November 1676. He was 
knighted before he took his matter of arts 
degree, which was conferred upon him in 
J 68 3, in confideration of his learning, and 
in return for a j^-efent of antiquities col- 
k<fted in his travels. He afterwards took 

fome

fome valuable preferments in the church ;. 
vras created doftor of divinity in 17025 and 
dicdFeb, 18, 1724. 

In 1682, was publifhed, ** A Journey 
â€¢* into Greece f hy George Wheler, Efq. in 
** company of DrÂ» Spon, o^ Lyons-, in fix 
** books ; with four tables of coins, and 
** many other fculpturca/' Fol. pp. 483* 

Thcfe gentlemen travelled With Pausa- 
K IAS in their hands, by whofe means they 
corrected, and explained, feveral of the an- 
tiquities and traditions of Greece. The pri- 
mary obje<5ts of thefe learned travellers were^ 
to copy the infcriptions, and dcfcribe the 
antiquities and coins of Greece and A/ia Mi-^^ 
nor, and partiijplarly of Athens, where they 
ibjourned a month. Thefe travels arc highly, 
valued for their authenticity, and are replete 
with found and inflrudtive erudition to the 
mcdallift and antiquary. 

Mr. Whex-er appears, on all occafions, 
to have been attentive to the natural hiftory 
of Greece^ and particularly to the plants, of 
which he enumerates feveral hundreds in 
this volume, and gives the . engravings of 
fome. Thefe catalogues fufiiciently evince 

his 



Whekr. 359 

his knowledge of the botany of hÂ« time. 
He brought from the Eaft feyeral which 
had not been cultivated in Britain before. 
Among thefe, the Hypericum olympichm (St. 

John's Wort of Olympus) is a well-known

After Sir George Wheler entered into 
the church, he publi/hed ^* An Account of 
" the Churches and Places of Aflfembly 
^* of the Primitive Chriftians ; from the 
** Churches of Tyre^ yerufalem, and Con^ 
'^* JiantinopJe^ defcribed by Euf^bius, and 
** ocular Obfervations of feveral very an- 
" tient Edifices yet extant in thpfe Parts :

1689. 

The Rev. Granville Wheler, of Otter-^ 
den Place^ Kent^ and redtor of heaky in Not^ 
tinghamflnre^ who died in 1770, was the 
third fon of Sir George Wheler, and be- 
came his heir. He diftinguifhed himfelf as 
a gentleman of fcience, and a polite fcholar. 
He was the friend and patron of Mr. Stephen

to revive the ftudy of cledirjicity in England. 
]Let me be allowed to add, that I wiih to 
piention the name of this gentleman with 
gratitude, from the recolledion of that en- 
couragement which I perfonally received 
from him in my purfuits of natural hiftory^ 
at n verj^ early period of life; and which 
was of fuch a nature, as feJdom fails tp ani*
