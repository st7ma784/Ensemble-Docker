GYNANDRIA MONANDRIA and 
DIANDRIA. 

The first and second Orders of this Class are perfectly na- 
tural, without any exception, or exclusion, comprehend- 
ing the whole natural order of the 0?'chis tribe, and, as 
far as our knowledge at present extends, no other plant 
whatever. The cells of the anther being, in several in- 
stances, more or less distant from each other, Linnaeus 
understood the whole tribe as diandrous ; but Swartz 
and others have corrected this error, proved to be such 
by the near relations of these plants the Scitaminece, 
the cells of whose anther are, in some instances, still 
more widely separated ; in others full as decidedly united, 
so as to constitute a single anther. The analogy of other 
parts of the Jlower in that fine exotic order, with which 
Mr. Roscoe alone may be said to have made botanists 
familiar, will, if I mistake not, render us better ac- 
quainted with the same parts in the beautiful and favour- 
ite family of Orchidece. I shall, in the first place, give 
its characters according to the ideas I have been in- 
duced to adopt from Nature herself, as well as from a 
careful study of the publications of Linnseus and Haller, 
compared with the transcendent improvements of Dr. 
Swartz and Mr. R. Brown. 

Orc/iide«. Linn. 7. Juss. 21. Br. Pr. 309. See .Grammar, 8 1 — 
84./. 70—72, n, 78. 

Flowers all complete and perfect. Embryo simple, or, as it 
is usually expressed, monocotyledonous. 

Calyx superior, of 3 leaves, either spreading or converging, 
sometimes coloured ; the uppermost often vaulted ; rare- 
ly extended at the base ; 2 lateral ones opposite, equal ; 
sometimes combined laterally, or dilated, or elongated, 
at the lower part ; all either deciduous, or, more rarely, 
permanent. 

Corolla likewise of 3 parts. Petals 2, interior, between the 
lateral and uppermost calyx-leaves, less than either, 
and almost always of a different substance and colour, 
ascending, or sometimes converging. Nectary a lip, in 
the same circle with the petals, projecting, or dependent, 
between the lateral calyx-leaves in front, often extended 
behind, beyond the calyx, in the form of one hollow 

b2 



4 

spur, rarely 2, various in length and acuteness, lodging 
the honey, which is otherwise produced by the smooth, 
furrowed, crested, or bearded, disk. The nectary there- 
fore strictly answers to the Linnaean definition, " as a part 
of the corolla," and supplies the place of a third petal. 
In some foreign OrcJiidece it bears a stalked appendage. 

Stamens gynandrous, partially imperfect. Filaments 3, 
united to the style, or colwmi, above the germen, within 
the uppermost calyx-leaf, opposite to the lip ; the 2 la- 
teral ones almost always abortive, and hardly discerni- 
ble; though these alone are perfect in Cypripedium, 
where the third, or uppermost, is wanting. Anther, in 
Gynandria Monandria, solitary, from the intermediate 
filament, of 2 cells, which are either widely separated, 
each cell at one side of the column ; or brought together 
into a simple vertical anther, either parallel to the stigma, 
and lying over it, fixed, and permanent ; or terminating 
tlie column in the form of a lid, which is moveable, at- 
tached by a sort of hinge at the back, and finally deci- 
duous ; each of its two cells being divided internally, by 
one, seldom three, longitudinal partitions. Pollen either 
of simple grains, or of fourfold globules, in masses fit- 
ting the cells. These masses, in the fixed divided an- 
ther, rarely in the terminal moveable one, or lid, consist 
of many angular portions, cohering by elastic ghiten ; in 
the parallel anther, rarely in the terminal one, they are 
rather powdery, forming plates of easily separable gra- 
nulations; in the lid-shaped anther they are usually 
waxy, homogeneous and smooth. When the cells open, 
the discharged pollen-masses stick by a taper base, or 
elastic thread, to the stigma, or to some adjoining glan- 
dular bodies above it, or to any thing else in their way. 

Germen altogether inferior, either roundish, obovate, or 
oblong, often twisted, having 3 principal ribs or angles, 
each opposite to a calyx-leaf Style, technically called 
in this tribe a column, stout, more or less united with the 
Jilaments, and bearing the anther, or anthers ; sometimes 
very short and thick. Stigma on the upper part of the 
style in front, facing the lip, either a mere concave moist 
depression, or protuberant, and often quadrangular ; it 
is accompanied at the summit or sides by one or two 
glands, serving to attach the dischai-ged pollen, and these 
are either naked, or contained in a membranous pouch, 
or pouches. 



Capsule shaped like the germen, of one cell, and three 
valves, splitting between the fixed ribs, generally at both 
sides of each valve ; rarely pulpy internally ; receptacles 
three, attached longitudinally to the centre of each valve. 

Seeds very n"umerous, minute, roundish, each enveloped in 
a large, loose, membranous tunic, wanting in the exotic 
Vanilla only, where they are imbedded in pulp ; albumen 
the shape of the seed ; embryo minute, simple, central, 
near the scar. 

Our British Orchidece are all herbaceous ; with either tu- 
berous or stoutly fibrous 7'oots, seldom if ever parasiti- 
cal. Their stem is simple, naked, or partly leafy ; leaves 
simple, undivided, entire, smooth and sleek ; sheathing 
or sessile ; ^OWCTS in a simple spike or cluster, which is 
rarely downy, glandular, or viscid ; each flower accom- 
panied, at the base of its partial stalk if there be any, by 
a solitary bractea. Some are highly fragrant, particu- 
larly in an evening, and many are very beautiful as well 
as singular. The tuberous roo/5 abound in glutinous mat- 
ter, and are generally esteemed nourishing and stimula- 
ting, making the Salep of the Turks. We must leave to 
conjecture the origin of this opinion. 

The integuments of the jlffwer in this family have never 
been understood as above described, by any preceding 
writer. Linnaeus considered the whole as a corolla, con- 
sisting of 5 petals and a nectary. Swartz calls the former 
a calyx of 5 leaves, and the latter a corolla, of a single 
petal, or lip. Jussieu and the botanists of his school, 
denying the existence of a corolla in any monocotyledo- 
nous plant, and rejecting the Linnaean term nectarium, 
call the whole a calyx of six divisions. But if a corolla be 
allowed to exist in nature at all, it surely cannot be de- 
nied to these plants ; any more than to the Scitaminece, 
far better known at present than when Jussieu's immor- 
tal work appeared in 1 789. These evidently settle the 
question. See Grammar 19. f. 1. If we will not allow 
them to have a corolla, we may, with equal propriety, 
deny the existence of such an organ in all herbs, or in 
all trees, or in any one natural order according to our- 
whim or fancy. The Orchidece, rightly understood, will 
be found as conclusive on the same side as the Scitami- 
nece, and they may possibly afford additional evidence of 
a corolla in monocotyledonous genera. 
Perhaps the most ingenious and important remark, in phy- 



6 

siological or systematic botany, that has been made in 
our clays, though I am by no means certain with whom 
it originated, relates to the numerical difference in the 
parts of fructification between the monocotyledoncs and 
dicotyledoncs. In the former, these parts are regulated 
by the number 3 or its compounds ; in the latter by 5. 
The exceptions in each case, consisting of partial sup- 
pressions, or subtractions, relative to some part or other, 
follow the same rules. Thus one third is suppressed in 
the styles or stigmas of Grasses and some Calamaricc ; one 
fifth in the calyx, corolla and stamens of some Bicornes, 
and other dicotyledoncs naturally decandrous; witness 
Erica, Vaccinium, Epilobium, &c. In Scitaminea: and Or- 
chidecE rudiments of 2 abortive stamens are observable, 
indicating a suppression of two thirds ; in Cypripedium 
indeed, which has 2 perfect stamens, only one third is 
wanting in those parts. The Orchidece are universally al- 
io wed to be monocotyledonous, or as some sayacotyledon- 
ous, which makes no real difference. Their parts of fruc- 
tification ai'e therefore governed by the number 3, not 5. 
It is contrary to every analogy to suppose they have 
either 5 calyx-leaves, or 5 petals ; with a solitary organ 
which, to avoid the use of the Linnaean term nectary, is 
called a lip, though this organ secretes and contains 
honey. But to take the 3 outer leaves of the flower for 
a calyx, and the other 3, (which are alternate therewith, 
as well as ranged in an interior circle,) for the corolla, 
composed of 2 petals and a nectary, the last being most 
correctly a part of the corolla, appears to me perfectly 
intelligible and consistent. My distinguished friends 
Professor de .Tussieu and Mr. Brown, from whose en- 
larged views the world has derived so much instruction, 
will, I am confident, pardon me if a search after truth 
leads me here to differ from them. The latter has in- 
deed, in the Hortus Kewensis, so far altered the theory 
he originally adopted from .Tussieu, as to term corolla in 
these plants, what he had caWed perianthii/m, and the can- 
dour of such an alteration does him the highest honour. 
The most eminent botanists have differed no less widely 
in the foundation of their generic distinctions of Orchi- 
deae. Linnaeus takes his characters chiefly from the form 
of the nectary, and especially of its posterior termination, 
without adverting to the anther. Haller first noticed the 
differences in this latter part, of which however he by no 



means formed correct ideas ; for like Linnaeus he consi- 
dered all these plants as diandrous. Neither are his dis- 
tinctions between his principal genera, Orchis and Epi~ 
pactis, clearly conceived or intelligibly defined. The 
latter is a most heterogeneous assemblage. His treat- 
ment of the subject displays, nevertheless, an able mind, 
perceiving, and laboriously contemplating, difficulties 
which he could not conquer. Dr. Swartz first accurately 
understood the structure of the anther, and happily di- 
vided the Orchidece into natural sections, according to 
the different shapes and positions of that part : taking 
further characters of the genera from those of Linnaeus. 
Mr. R. Brown, in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollan- 
dice, and in the second edition of Mr. Alton's Hortus 
Keivensis, has revised the whole order with his accus- 
tomed learning and accuracy, so as to confirm and illus- 
trate the genera of Swartz, adding many new ones from 
the ample stores of New Holland, and strengthening the 
whole by characters derived from the texture or consis- 
tence of the masses of pollen, (the anthers of authors an- 
tecedent to Swartz,) in which substance Haller had re- 
marked differences, without turning them to account in 
practical arrangement. Mr. Brown has derived further 
assistance from the presence or absence of certain little 
pouches or cells, enclosing glands or tubercles, to which 
the pollen-masses attach themselves, near the stigma. I 
by no means doubt the use of these minute parts in sci- 
entific discrimination, provided neither they, nor any 
other, be allowed to overrule or contradict nature. But 
I do not find it necessary to resort to what is obscure or 
difficult, when I can derive clear, constant and natural 
characters, from parts more easy of examination. Even 
the position of the calyx and petals, whether spreading or 
converging, is unquestionably of great importance in this 
family. Whether, by the obvious and intelligible dis- 
tinctions of genera to which I have resorted, I have made 
the study of this beautiful and interesting family satisfac- 
tory, those who follow me must decide. I wish the prac- 
tical student of nature alone to be my judge ; nor shall 
I be flattered by a blind or implicit adoption of my ideas, 
without examination. 
Further remarks and illustrations will occur as we proceed 
with the history of our British genera and species.

depression, in front, under, or between, the masses of 
pollen. Capsule oblong, spiral. Seeds very numerous, 
oval, each in a light chaffy tunic, extended at both ends. 
Roots doubly tuberous, fleshy, either globular or palmate, 
whitish, internally viscid, with thick, fibrous, superior radi- 
cles,- each knob, or tuber, solitaiy, rarely in pairs, flowering 
but once, and that mostly in the season immediately subse- 
quent to its formation. Ste7n solitary, leafy at the base. 
Leaves chiefly radical, spreading, elliptic-oblong, or lan- 
ceolate, ribbed, accompanied at the bottom by a few 
membranous scales, like abortive leaves ; their upper sur- 
face often spotted with brown or black ; under surface 
palest. Fl. numerous, spiked, purple, crimson, or whitish; 
in some highly fragrant. Cal. ribbed, coloured, as are 
frequently the germen, common stalk, and bracteas. Na- 
tives of meadows, groves, or open chalky downs.

Knobs of the root each tapering into a fibrous point. Stem angu- 
lar, about a foot high, often more. Leaves usually two, spread- 
ing, elliptical, 3 inches long, of a bright shining unspotted green ; 
very rarely accompanied by a third, smaller and more upright. 
Bracteas lanceolate, about as long as the germen, one to each 
flower, besides a few larger, scattered along the stem. Flowers 
numerous, in a rather loose spike, pure white, except a greenish 
tinge on the lip and spur. The latter is rather tumid towards 
the end. Lip linear-oblong, about the size of the calyx-leaves, 
straight. Cells of the anther widely separated, by the semicir- 
cular abrupt termination of the style. Pollen-masses yellow, 
club-shaped, erect, each attaching itself to a gland-like naked 
tubercle, at each side of the centre of the flower^ but sticking 
likewise to various parts of the plant occasionally. 

The glands which receive the pollen being separated, and naked, 
or destitute of any cell or pouch, afford the distinctive character 



10 GYNANDRIA— MONANDRIA. Orchis. 

of Mr. Brown's Habenaria, which, with all deference to my can- 
did and learned friend, one of the few who seek truth for its own 
sake, seems to me an unnatural division of the genus Orchis. 
Willdenow's Habenaria is of no account whatever, being found- 
ed merely on the presence of 2 abortive filaments, which he hap- 
pened to observe in some species, and which are proper, more 
or less evidently, to the whole natural order, though never duly 
understood till Mr. Brown pointed them out. 
O. bifolia exhales, in an evening, the scent of the sweetest honey- 
suckle. jS differs merely in its smaller size. The figure in 
Vaillant, and several of the above synonyms, answer equally 
well to either variety.

lanceolate, channelled, acute. Spike of a dense pyramidal form, 
subsequently obtuse, all over of a rich crimson, occasionally milk 
white and peculiarly delicate, which variety Haller appears never 
to have seen. The lobes of the lip are very rarely not quite en- 
tire ; spur slender, about the length of the slender, smooth and 
even germen. Cells of the anther close together. Two protu- 
berances near the origin of the lip, in front, hollow underneath, 
are the essential mark of this elegant species. The flowers are 
more or less fragrant, even in the day-time.

Knobs neariy globose, not pointed ; one of them often a little re- 
moved from the other by a stalk. Stem clothed vv^ith leafy 
sheaths. Leaves lanceolate, of a rather dull unspotted green, 
somewhat glaucous ; the under side paler and shining. Spike 
rather lax. Bracteas lanceolate, membranous, partly purple, 
the length of the germens. Fl. scentless, purple ; sometimes 
pale, or flesh-coloured j sometimes varying to crimson, or to a 
light violet ; but the numerous green ribs of the calyx-leaves 
are equally strong in all the varieties. These 3 leaves converge 
over the column in a vaulted form, enclosing the petals. Spur 
blunt, rather shorter than the germen, curved upwards. Lip in 
4 unequal lobes; the lateral ones largest, deflexed, mostly

In pastures, groves and shady dells, plentifully. 

Perennial. April, May. 

Somewhat larger than the preceding, especially the roots. 
Leaves chiefly radical, elliptic-lanceolate, sleek and shining, of 
a fine green, more or less stained with purplish black, though 
foreign authors describe what seems an unspotted variety ; the 
under side is paler, as usual in this tribe. Fl. of a more uni- 
form purplish crimson than the last ; the disk of the lip in like 
manner whitish and spotted, with a fine downy surface. Calyx- 
leaves with 3 ribs, not distinguished by any gi-een colour ; the 
uppermost converging with the petals into a hood ; the 2 late- 
ral ones bent strongly upwards, and spreading. Cells of the 
anther close together, deep purple. Masses of pollen yellow, 
undivided. Ger men, as well as bract eas, purple. Spur tumid, 
turned a little upwards. Lip unequally four-lobed, variously 
notched or toothed. 

Thesejiowers, though without scent, cannot but engage the atten- 
tion of all who admire the charms of spring, and they mix with 
the Hare-bell, Cowslip, and Cuckoo-flower in country nose- 
gays. They are probably what the Queen in Hamlet terms 
" Long-purples." The Rev. H. Davies has often found them 
perfectly white, nor did they change when transplanted.

Much smaller than any of the foregoing, the stem being, with us, 
rarely more than 3 or 4 inches high, scarcely leafy but in the 
lower part. The plates of Haller and the Fl. Dan. represent it 
about a foot in height. Leaves spreading, lanceolate, rather 
glaucous, without spots. Spike oblong, dense, obtuse, of nu- 
merous small flowers, whose dark converging calyx-leaves, and 
blackish dots on the lip, give them a scorched or burnt aspect. 
Bracteas small, ovate, acute, coloured. The spur is deflexed, 
incurved, blunt, scarcely above one third the length of the ger- 
men. Lip roughish with minute points, purplish, with a white 
disk, divided into 4 entire lobes, the 2 lower ones often having 
a small intermediate point, like the following species, to which 
this is more allied than to any of the preceding.

On chalky bushy hills, and about woods, chiefly in Kent. 

Near Greenhithe, Kent. Gerarde. About Rochester. Curtis. 

Perennial. May. 

Except its size, which is five times that of the last, this species 
comes nearer to that, in the structure of its flower, and hue of 
the calyx, than to any other. It is the largest and most mag- 
nificent Orchis of British growth j O. hircina perhaps excepted, 
which the present excels in colour. The stem varies in height 
from 1 to 2 feet, and is most leafy about the lower part. Leaves 
4 or 5, spreading, elliptical, not ovate, of a full, bright, not glau- 
cous, green, 3 or 4 inches long, and 1-^ or 2 in breadth. Spike 
cylindrical, rather dense, many-flowered. Bracteas acute, sel- 
dom a quarter the length of the germen, though variable in size. 
Calyx-leaves ovate, concave, bluntly pointed, converging, some- 
what connected in the lower part ; marked externally with dark 
brown lines, and confluent spots ; internally green. Petals 
linear-oblong, covered by the calyx, pink or purplish, speckled 
with a darker hue. Lip the colour of the petals, either pink 
or purple, sometimes light flesh-coloured, rough with promi- 
nent dark-coloured points ; the disk pale, or whitish j the mar- 
gin deeply four-lobed, with a small intermediate central point j 
the two lower lobes much the broadest, more or less toothed or 
crenate. Spur deflexed, obtuse, tumid, not half the length of 
the lip, or of the germen. Cells of the anther close together. 

Thejlowers have no very remarkable scent, at least not constant- 
ly ; but in drying the whole herb exhales a strong odour like 
that of Asperula odorata, or Anthoxanthum odoratum, which is 
equally observable in the two following. Curtis has not repre- 
sented the petals, which may be seen in Engl. Bot. His plate 
is otherwise excellent.

also at Pentley Hangings, Stoken Church, where Dr. Williams 
first found it. Mr. Bicheno. 

Perennial. May. 

Herb smaller in every part than the preceding. Leaves narrower, 
rather more lanceolate and acute. Fl. of a more slender and 
elongated form, especially their calyx-leaves, which end in 
longish taper points, and are directed more upwards. They are 
at first sight distinguished by their silvery ash-colour, and the 
total want of those dark ribs, or stains, which have given its name 
to O.fusca. The lip moreover is considerably elongated in the 
disk, and ends in two much less dilated, though variable, lobes, 
reaching far beyond the small intermediate one, and of a crim- 
son or purple hue, deeper than the petals. Wulfen has well 
described this Orchis, in Jacquin's Collectanea, and the figure, 
drawn I believe by him, in the Ic. Rar., well represents its dis- 
tinguishing characters, of which the tapering points and grey 
hue of the calyx, and the more elongated lip, contracted in the 
middle, are the most apparent. It has the same scent as the 
last while drying. 

This is the Swedish 0. militaris, intended by Linnaeus as the type of 
that species, and appears not to be rare in various parts of 
Europe. 1 have traced its several varieties, in the grass-plats 
about Rome, so nearly to O.fusca on the one hand, and 0. te- 
phrosanthos on the other, se-^ Tour on the Continent, erf. 2. v. 2.

studied them growing. I think the difierence is most satisfac-

Rather smaller than the last, with which its herbage otherwise 
accords. The spike and bracteas scarcely differ in the slightest 
degree from that species, any more than the pale, taper-pointed 
leaves of the calyx, or the almost linear, purplish petals. The 
only remarkable distinction is observable in the lip of the nec- 
tary, which is deeply divided into 4 linear, obtuse, equal and 
uniform, purplish segments, with a small intermediate point ; 
all pale or whitish at the base, like the disk of the lip whence 
they originate, which is downy and dotted. From frequent 
examination of these plants growing, and not from neglect or 
inattention, I have, like Linnaeus who studied them at Fon- 
tainebleau, long concluded them to constitute but one species, 
the varieties of 0. militaris appearing to combine O. tephro- 
santhos with the very different 0. fusca. I am still dubious with 



GYNANDRIA— MONANDRIA. Orchis. 17 

regard to tephrosanthos and vuUtaris, both which do indeed 
differ from fusca, in their taper-pointed cahjx. They all three 
smell like Woodruff" or Melilot in drying. 

It is remarkable that Mr. Bicheno should have referred to Engl. 
Bot. t, 1873 as the militaris. I have traced out this error^ for 
which he is not responsible, and which Dr. Hooker has cor- 
rected. But it is still more remarkable that neither of these 
writers should have noticed Columna's excellent and original 
figure of tephrosanthos. The synonyms of these plants, and of 
some foreign species related to them, might still afford matter 
for a long and careful inquiry. I have endeavoured to be 
exact in the references belonging to our British species, and 
have found much to correct in the course of their examination. 

A white-flowered variety is exhibited by Dr. Hooker, as well as 
a highly curious monstrosity, in which there are two complete 
nectaries to one flower, with only two calyx-leaves, and no 
petals. 

The Orchis of Breynius, Cent. t. 42, wrongly quoted by Haller as 
our tephrosanthos, copied in Rudb. Elijs. v. 2. 194./. 9, figured 
by Columna, Ecphr. v. 2. t. 9, and by Garidel, t. 76, is a very 
distinct species, 0. undulatifolia of Bivona-Bernardi, Cent. 2. 
44. t. 6. Sm. Prodr. Fl. Grcec. v. 2. 213. The 0. longibracteata 
of the same author. Cent. 1. 57. t.4, is another very fine spe- 
cies^ most allied to 0. fusca, but distinct. Linnaeus, very un- 
accountably, makes t. 42 of Breynius a variety of his own 
Ophnjs insectifera !

Perennial. July. 

One of the finest of its tribe. I have counted above 60 flowers 
in one spike. The knobs of the root ai-e almost globular, and 
very large. Stem from 2 to 3 feet high, hollow, leafy. Leaves 
light green, slightly glaucous, erect, elliptic-lanceolate, acute, 
varying in breadth. Spike rather lax, upright. Bracteas linear- 
lanceolate, acute, often longer than the flowers including their 
lip. Fl. from 20 to about 60, strongly, not pleasantly, scented, 
dull in colour, but curious and singular in appearance. Cat. 
converging over the petals, its leaves ovate, concave, obtuse ; 
green, spotted with dull purple internally. Pet. of the same 
colours, narrow, linear. Lip in 3 linear, curved, purplish lead- 
coloured segments ; the lateral ones hardly extending beyond 
the calyx ; middle one four times as long, variously twisted ; 
notched or jagged at the end ; disk pale, or white, downy, spot- 
ted with purple. Spur short and tumid, whence Linnaeus was 
led to refer this plant to his very artificial genus Satyrium, 
though it naturally follows our four preceding species of Orchis, 
to each of which it has some mark of affinity. In all of them 
the spur is more or less tumid, and slightly cloven, at the point. 

Mr. Graves is recorded by Dr. Hooker as having sometimes found 
a /lower with a double lip, as in the foregoing, and once a double 
spike of blossoms.

Root of several, clustered, tapering, almost cylindrical, undivided 
knobs, vvith a few slender thread-shaped radicles, from above 
their common origin. Mr. Sowerby thought these knobs were 
perlected, and produced a flowering plant, in successive pairs ; 
but Dr. Wahlenberg, whose opinion is adopted by Dr. Hooker, 
judged them to consist of two sets, each set being destined suc- 
cessively to bear a plant, like the knobs, whether globose or pal- 
mate, of other Orchises. These writers reckon about five knobs, 
which they term radicles, in each cluster. The real radicles how- 
ever, the essential part of a roo^, see Introd. to Botany, chap. 12, 
are very distinct, as pointed out by Mr. Sowerby, an dare about 
four, thread-shaped, more slender than the knobs, which last ap- 
pear to me to be usually, if not invariably, three in each cluster 
or set, formed one season, flowering the next, and withering 
afterwards entirely away. I have transplanted various roots of 
this species, but could never succeed in their cultivation. Stem 
seldom more than a foot high, leafy, hollow. LeavesWght green, 
lanceolate, rather glaucous beneath ; the lower ones broadest, 
and rounded at the end. Spike cylindrical, dense, of many small 
Jlowers, in which I have but seldom perceived any fragrance, 
though Gunner and Ray describe them as sweet-scented. Brac- 
teas ovate-lanceolate, bluntish, about the length of the germen. 
Calyx-leaves and petals ovate, concave, moderately converging, 
cream-coloured, all more alike in form, size and hue than in 
most of our British Orchidece. Lip greener, about the same 
length, in 3 deep pointed lobes, the middle one largest, and 
sometimes bluntish. Spur incurved, short and thick. Pollen- 
masses cloven, their globules larger and more distinct than in 
undisputed species of Orchis. They appear, by Dr. Hooker's 
excellent plate, each to proceed from a hood or scale ; but are 
understood by Mr. Brown to be naked, as they ought to be in 
his genus Habenaria.

I suspect /3 to be scarcely a variety, and that Dillenius, in this, as 
in many other instances, has introduced into his edition of the 
Synopsis, under a new name, what existed there already. The 
late Rev. Mr. Wood of Leeds thought he once found in Wales, 
early in summer, the Orchis sambiicina, which 1 have supposed 
the O. pusilla alba odorata 8ic. of Ray might be. But we learn 
from Jacquin that O. samhudna is scentless, the smell of Elder 
belonging rather, as Mr. Davall noticed, to 0. pallens, whose 
roots are globular.

Knobs two or more, thick at their origin, but cloven and tapering 
below, accompanied by several cylindrical radicles. Ehrhart, 
among the fanciful Greek names in his Phytophjlacium, calls 
this plant therefore Diplorrhiza ; giving to the preceding the 
appellation of Triplorrhiza, understanding it as above described. 
The stem is commonly from 3 to 6 inches high, rarely taller, 
leafy. Leaves ovate or elliptical, deep green ; the uppermost 
lanceolate, and acute. Spike rather lax. Bracteas lanceolate, 
erect, leafy 5 the lower ones rising much above the^0M;ers, which 
are for the most part green and inconspicuous, though twice the 
size of the last. Cal. green, tipped or bordered with brown, closely

converging over the green, much narrower, petals. Lip twice as 
long as the calyx, dependent, linear-oblong, ending in 2 sharp 
lobes, with a smaller central one ; its disk greenish yellow ; 
sides mostly brown ; but the colour of the •whol&Jiower is va- 
riable. Cells of the anther brown, rather distant, with a naked 
gland at the base of each to receive the pollen-masses, consist- 
ing of large yellow granulations. 
C. Bauhin and Rudbeck have noticed this Orchis twice. The Se- 
rapias hatrachites, Ger. Em. 224./. 8, Orchis batrachoides, Da- 
lech. Hist. 1560./, must be a distinct species. It is 0. herma- 
phroditica, Bauh.Pin. 83. Rudb. Elijs. v. 2. 199./. «i. The latter 
refers to 0. melittias, Ger. Em. 213./, which surely cannot be 
the same. Systematic writers have not adverted to these syno- 
nyms, nor does any popular author appear to have met with 
either of Gerarde's plants.

Root irregularly and imperfectly paknate, the knobs not being so 
much divided as in most of this section ; especially that des- 
tined to bear flowers in the ensuing season, which is later and 
smaller than usual. Herb various in size, luxuriance, breadth 
of leaves, and colour, having often a purple tint. Stem from 
one to two feet high, leafy, hollow. Leaves lanceolate, or some- 
what ovate, unspottedj erect, gradually smaller upward. Spike 
dense, many-flowered. Bracteas linear-lanceolate, pointed, often 
purple ; the lower ones much longer than the flowers ; upper 
more or less so. Fl. varying from a pale flesh-colour, or white, 
to a full rose or crimson, the spreading calyx dotted, but other- 
wise of the same hue as the petals and nectary. Spur rather 
thick, conical, deflexed, shorter than the germen. Lip variously 
notched, generally somewhat three-lobed ; its disk elegantly 
variegated with dark purple and white, deflexed at the sides. 

Authors appear to have made several species out of this one. At 
least I could never ascertain more than one in Britain, to which 
all the above synonyms surely belong. The variety j3 has not 
been noticed since the time of Dillenius. Some Swiss speci- 
mens, though dried 30 years ago, retain much of a purple co- 
lour in their herbage, and what Dillenius has adopted from 
Gibson's edition of Cambden may have been either such a va- 
riety, or possibly a plant we shall speak of hereafter. See Epi- 
pactis, n. 2. Some of Vaillant's references regard 0. sambucina, 
an alpine species, sufficiently distinct.

Perennial. June. 

Root distinctly palmate, with many long and slender divisions. 
Herb of a bright unspotted green, variable in luxuriance. Stem 
generally about 18 inches high, leafy, hollow. Leaves lanceo- 
late, often nearly linear, acute. Spike cylindrical, rather lax, 
many-flowered. Bracteas ovate, taper-pointed, not much longer 
than the germen. Fl. of a uniform crimson in every part, with- 
out spots, smaller than most of the genus, exhaling a most pow- 
erful and delicious odour, resembling that of a Clove Pink. They 
are now and then found white. Lateral leaves of the calyx 
widely spreading. Petals slightly converging along with the 
upper calyx-leaf, and nearly the same size. Lip of the nectary 
minutely downy, in three uniform, equal, entire, rather deep, 
flat lobes j spur about twice as long as the germen, pointing 
downwards, or occasionally curved upwards, cylindrical, acute, 
very slender. Anther crimson. 

Caspar Bauhin, and other botanists of his time, have made seve- 
ral truly futile species out of this. O. odoratissima of Linnaeus 
is the only plant likely to be confounded with it ; but the leaves 
of that are still narrower, and the blunt recurved spur is not 
longer than \\\^ calyx. This is represented in Bauhin'sPro<:?r.30. 
/. 2; but Rudbeck's 213./. 7, intended for it, is 0. conopsea. 

Mr. Brown has observed the glands which receive the pollen to be 
naked, or destitute of the hood, or slight covering, proper to his 
genus Orchis. On this character he founds his Gymnadenia, so 
named from these naked glands. But the plant in question has 
so strong a generic affinity to several which are furnished with 
this hood, especially 0. pyramidalis, that it appears to me a 
most striking confirmation of the important principle of Linnaeus, 
genus dabitcliaracterem,non character genus. An eminent French 
botanist it seems is pursuing these subdivisions still further ; 
so that, as Dr. Hooker has observed to me, we may soon have 
nearly as many genera in Orchidea as there are species.

brownish. Found in chalky fields and pastures. 

The want of a spur distinguishes this plant from Orchis, 
with which genus it otherwise most naturally agrees. 
From Ophrys Mr. Brown separates it by the hood of its 
glands being single, which, confirmed by the habit, is here 
unquestionably important. I nevertheless prefer more 
obvious, and no less certain, characters, founded on the 
converging calyx and long flat lip.

26 GYNANDRIA— MONANDRIA. Herminium. 

Stem 1 2 or 1 5 inches high, bearing 4 or 5 spreading leaves near 
the bottom, and 1 or 2 small, sheathing, upiight ones towards 
the middle. Spike long, cylindrical, of numerous, rather 
crowded, scentless powers, whose green hue, tinged more or 
less with brown, renders them not very conspicuous. The lip 
however is usually of a pale yellow, without any spots, though 
occasionally tipped with brown, or dark red. Ray noticed such 
a variety near Geneva, and in his Synopsis speaks of it as but 
a variety. I gathered one at Valcimara among the Apennines, 
with the lip entirely red ; see Tour on the Cont. ed. 2. v. 2. 325, 
which is marked with no character of a distinct species. 
Willdenow has, after Link, published an Ophrys anthropomorpha, 
Sp. PL V. 4. 63, distinguished by the lip being only half the 
length of the germen. Hence a specific character for our Aceras 
is become necessary.

Cal, superior, of 3 ovate, concave, equal, spreading, perma- 
nent leaves. Pet. 2, fleshy, ovate, fiat, spreading, more 
or less deeply three-lobed, acute, nearly as long as the 
calyx. Nect. a lip witliout a spw\ deeply three-lobed, 
spreading like the petals, but rather longer, slightly tu- 
mid at the base underneath. Aiith. roundish, of 2 cells 
close together, over the stigma, depositing the globular, 
stalked, granulated masses of pollen, by their stalks, 
upon 2 separate naked glands. Germen elliptic-oblong, 
twisted, furrowed. Style short and thick. Stigma a moist 
cavity in front. Caps, ovate-oblong, triangular, nearly 
straight. Seeds very numerous. 

Root of two globular knobs, rather woolly; one of them 
stalked, distant, later than the other. Stem solitary, 3 or 
4 inches high, leafy below. Leaves elliptic-lanceolate, 
sheathed at the base. Fl. spiked, numerous, small, 
greenish-yellow. 

This genus, happily restored by Mr. Brown, is clearly and 
essentially marked by the petals and lip nearly resem- 
bling each other, and being all three-lobed. Malaxis of 
Swartz has long been separated from the original Her- 
7ninium, with which it has little affinity, though both 
were referjed to Ophrys by Linnaeus in his later publi- 
cations.

Perennial. June, July. 

Root of several thick woolly fibres, and one globular haiiy knob, 
the size of a large pea, whicli is the source of the plant of the 
present year. One of these apparent fibres, rarely more, bears 
at its extremity a small young knob, destined to enlarge after- 
wards, and to flower in the following summer. Herb smooth, of 
a light bright green. Stem 4 or 5 inches high. Leaves two, 
rarely three, sheathing, alternate, at, or near, the bottom of the 
stem, elliptic-lanceolate, acute, obscurely ribbed, concave 3 the 
third, if present, often elevated towards the middle of the stem ; 
and there is occasionally a small, membranous, lanceolate, 
taper-pointed bractea higher up, similar to those under each 
flower. Spike dense, 1 ^ or 2 inches long. Fl. small, numerous, 
smelling like musk and honey, especially in an evening. Cal. 
green, leafy, concave, spreading equally in three directions. 
Pet. of a totally different substance, thick, yellowish, longer 
than the calyx, spreading between its leaves ; ovate at the base, 
with a more or less prominent angle, or lobe, at each side, and 
suddenly tapering into an elongated point. Lip of the exact

substance and hue of the petals, but more deeply lobed at each 
side, spreading equally with them, and about the same length, 
pale and somewhat tumid at its base. Column short and thick. 
Anth. in front, roundish, pale brown, as is likewise the pollen, 
the glands that receive it being, as Mr. Brown observes, naked 
and separate, which is doubtless a confirmation of the genus, 
though I prefer an obvious character founded on the very pecu- 
liar petals and nectary ; which so strongly resemble each other, 
and so widely differ from the calyx ; just like those of Stelis, 
see Exot. Bot. t. 75, the structure of which irrefragably confirms 
the above views of Herminium. 
I have adopted the specific character of Mr. Brown, presuming 
that he has formed it from an acquaintance with some more 
species, of which perhaps tractes may be found in Lobel, Gerarde, 
Mentzelius, and others, though no systematic botanist hitherto 
has verified their figures, one of which has hairy leaves !

This is one of the most distinct species. Its habit is more slender 
than the rest, and the leaves narrower, a little glaucous. Stem 
somewhat leafy, usually about a foot high. Fl. about six, more 
or less, rather distant, sessile, each with a lanceolate sheathing 
bractea, longer than the germen. They strikingly resemble some 
sort of fly, yet not any one in particular. Cal. widely spread-

narrow, chocolate-coloured, downy, as long as the calyx. Lip 
twice that length, dependent ; its disk convex, smooth, marked

with a pale blueish, shining, partly cloven, spot in the middle ; 
otherwise of the colour of the petals, having four broadish, nearly 
equal, widely spreading, or deflexed, more or less downy, en- 
tire, marginal lobes, each about as long as the disk. The under 
side is concave, green, very smooth, without any traces of a 
spur or keel. There are two shining prominent spots at the 
base of the lip above. The column is obtuse, not extending be- 
yond the obovate anther. Mr. Ferdinand Bauer, the ingenious 
draughtsman of the Flora Grceca, is recorded by Mr. Brown as 
having first observed the glands which receive the pollen to be 
contained in two distinct hoods. This confirms the more ob- 
vious generic character founded on the convex or tumid lip. 
The larger variety, ^, appears by Buddie's herbarium to differ very 
slightly from the common sort ; though the figures of old au- 
thors quoted for it are probably different, as the small inter- 
mediate point of their lip indicates.

Of the size and habit of the last, with which the general aspect of 
the powers accords, though they are of a somewhat lighter 
brown, and seldom more than three in each spike. I have had 
no opportunity of comparing this plant with the 0. aranifera in 
a fresh state, as it blossoms 6 weeks or 2 months later, but 
from an examination of the flowers, recent as weil as dried, the 
following differences are observable. The -petals are minutely 
downy, or rough, on their inner surface, and are remarkably 
dilated, or ovate, in their lower half, terminating with an oblong- 
blunt point. The lip is rather longer than the calyx, obovate, 
convex, but not tumid or inflated ; the disk brown, smooth ; the 
sides very hairy ; but the margin itself smooth, thin, pale, ex- 
panded, not inflexed, wavy, not lobed, nor is there any terminal 
point or appendage. The column ends in a short, thick, inflexed 
beak. Each cell of the anther has a dilated, pale, membranous 
border, though scarcely more considerable than in O. aranifera. 

Rudbeck's figure, taken from a specimen in Burser's herbarium 
at Upsal, is among those which he has added, as new species, 
to what C. Bauhin enumerates. This figure is very character- 
istic, except the petals being too narrow throughout. I can 
find no traces of this Ophrys in any other writer. 0. arachnites 
of Scopoli, Willdenow, &c, Haller's Orchis n. 1 266, not hitherto 
observed in Britain, though common on the continent, is dis- 
tinguished by an inflexed, flattish, smooth appendage to the 
very broad Up ; its petals, all over hairy in front, are smooth at 
the back, and are contracted gradually from the broad base up- 
ward ; the calyx is green. 0. arachnoides, Andr. Repos. t.470, 
my supposed variety of 0. apifera, Tour on the Continent, ed. 2. 
V. 2. 325, if not a species, is rather perhaps a variety of arach- 
nites, with coloured petals and calyx. Yet the former are downy 
on both sides, and there is a very peculiar deep central depres- 
sion on the lip. Haller may have overlooked our three latter 
species, as varieties of his n. 1266, for they are probably natives 
of Switzerland. Vaillant, as far as he goes, is the most correct 
in his figures of Orchidece, as well as in their synonyms.

34 GYNANDRIA— MONANDRIA. Neottia. 

In an old birch wood called Ca hue, or Yellow hill, about 2 miles 
from the head of little Loch Broom, Ross-shire. Lightfoot. Op- 
posite Moy hall, near Inverness. Dr. Hope. About Brodie 
house, Moray. J. Brodie, Esq. Found by Mr. Murray in the 
woods of Culloden, near Inverness, and about Gordon castle 
and Scone. Hooker. 

Perennial. July. 

Root branched, knotty, or jointed, with downy radicles, creeping 
extensively among moss and rotten leaves ; each shoot termi- 
nating in a solitary tuft of 6 or 8 broad-stalked, ovate, bluntish, 
smooth leaves, an inch long, somewhat speckled with brown, 
marked with 5 ribs, connected by transverse veins. Flowering 
stems solitary, from the centres of some of these tufts, hardly 
a span high, round, smooth, bearing several scattered, erect, 
linear-lanceolate, acute, smooth bracteas. Spike s])iral, downy, 
with a downy tapering bractea to each flower, rising rather 
above the downy germen. Fl. small, spirally unilateral, about 
10 to 15 in each spike, sweet-scented. CoL externally downy, 
white like the petals. Nect. white in the tumid part, with 
tawny stripes j the point white or pale red, lanceolate, keeled, 
projecting nearly as far as the inflated base. Caps, light brown, 
smooth. 

The tumid base of the nectary, being placed above, not behind, 
the calyx, is not a spur, but a part of the lip, and justifies the 
opinion of Lightfoot, that Linnseus ought rather to have refer- 
red this plant to his genus Serapias. 

G. pubescens of Mr. Brown, a North American species, is twice as 
tall, with larger, more strongly speckled leaves, 30 or AQ flowers 
in a straight, not spiral, spike, and a very short, ascending point 
to the nectary. But our G. repens grows also in the colder 
parts of North America, and may have been mistaken for the 
true pubescens, though obviously distinct. 

It is with great pleasure that I now adopt this genus of my 
learned friend, from whom I always hesitate to difler in opinion ; 
especially as the name he has chosen records one of the most 
deserving of our early english botanists, Mr, John Goodyer of 
Hampshire, commemorated by Johnson in his preface to the 
second edition of Gerarde's Herbal, and whose very accurate 
and intelligent communications enrich many parts of that 
work ; see particularly the chapter on Elms.

In open pastures, on a chalky or gravelly soil, or in meadows, in

Perennial. August, September. 

Knobs of the root 2, 3, or more, ovate-oblong, brown, downy, 
nearly perpendicular, successive, apparently besprinkled with 
small capillary radicles, which if so are very remarkable. Leaves 
several, all radical, on broad stalks, spreading, ovate, acute, 
ribbed, rather glaucous. Stalk radical, a finger's length or more, 
viscid and downy upwards, clothed with several sheathing, 
upright, pointed bracteas. Spike spiral, of many, crowded, 
small, white, highly fragrant ,^OM;ers, in a single row, each with 
an ovate, tumid, pointed, downy, close bractea. 

Haller doubtless comprehends this under his Epipaciis n. 1294, 
though his t. 38 represents a very distinct species, with long

upright leaves 'and more slender roots, the powers larger, and 
less crowded, with a dilated lip. This blossoms earlier, and 
is well distinguished by Vaillant, as well as by Mr. J. Lindley 
in his Collectanea Botanica. We have no account of it as a 
british plant. It is Micheli's Orchiastrum, t.26. /. D : and 
Seguier has the same, with confused synonyms, in his Suppl.

Perennial. July. 

Root of 2 thick, fleshy, downy, annual, perpendicular knobs, each 
w , . about three inches long, and one fifth of an inch in diameter near 
.ryt ^^-t^.t'M^ its origin, tapering downwards to ia blunt point. Leaves five or

«?«  <*- /^^f*K.,the footstalks of the innermost leaves, and bearing in the upper 
TkAr^ y/Tt part 2 or 3 lanceolate, smooth, upright bracteas. Spike an inch 
/. _'jNr^^'long, ovate, dense, erect, of about 18 white ^ott^ers in three 
. * y A ^rows, twisted round in a very remarkable way, and each ac- 
*** ti*^ '^companied by a smooth lanceolate bractea, as tall as itself. 
4ht*^. t. ^2r,The Jlowers much resemble those of N. spiralis, and the lip 
^'\s fringed ; but the calyx and petals are twice as long as in 
that species, and the calyx is more taper-pointed. The outside 
of the Jlowers, and the capsule, are downy : every other part 
of the herb is smooth. Buds, destined to flower the following 
year, are formed among the leaves, at the bottom of the flower- 
stalk. After flowering the root decays, and the following spring 
each bud puts forth a pair of oblong knobs, as above described, 
and becomes a separate plant. 
Such is the account given by the accurate Mr. Drummond, and 
communicated to me in August 18) 0, along with a specimen, 
by the Rev. Mr. Hincks of Cork. Several living plants were 
sent to the Cork garden, but their roots were destroyed by rats. 
I have waited from year to year for specimens in a fresh state ; 
but hitherto in vain. The above characters will sufliciently 
identify the species when found, and it is a most interesting 
addition to our Flora.

litary, from 1 to 2 feet high, straight, bearing about the middle 
2, rarely 3, sessile, elliptical, smooth, spreading leaves, each 
with 3, 5, or more ribs. The stem above their insertion is more 
slender, and downy, terminating in a long cluster of very nu- 
merous green Jlowers. Bracteas ovate, pointed, smooth, shorter 
than the partial stalks. Cal. somewhat tinged with brown, 
Fet. and Up light green ; the latter without any lobes at the 
base ; its disk marked with a honey-bearing furrow, evidently 
justifying the name oi nectary for this part. The column termi- 
nates in a concave, obovate, hood-like appendage, which seems 
peculiar to this species. Each mass oi poUen is cloven, or double.

Perennial. May, June. 

Root of innumerable, crowded, tufted, simple, thick, cylindrical, 
whitish, fleshy knobs, or radicles ; for with their true nature no- 
body is as yet acquainted. They grow imbedded among dead 
leaves, at the roots of trees ; but I could never, any more than 
Dr. Hooker, detect a parasitical attachment. The whole herb 
indeed has the true pallid hue, destitute of green, peculiar to 
parasitical plants in general, as the late Mr. Dryander long ago 
observed ; and to which remark the generality of OrchidecE in 
India are no exception, their radicles being mostly nourished by 
rotten bark, not by the living tree. Stem solitary, erect, simple, 
angular, hollow, without leaves, but clothed with tubular, lax, 
membranous, obtuse, alternate sheaths. Cluster cylindrical, 
many-flowered, <lense, except at the bottom, smooth. Bracteas 
oblong, small. Fl. pale brown in every part. Cal. and pet. 
moderately and equally spreading. Lip concave at the base ; 
cloven at the extremity into 2 blunt, rounded, widely spreading 
lobes. Column cylindrical, without any hood, y^nth. at the 
summit, in front, elliptical, convex, of 2 close, linear, parallel 
cells, depositing the yellow, finely granulated, simple, oblong 
masses of pollen on the back of the oblong upper lip of the 
stigma, the under lip of which is short and rounded. Caps, oval, 
with thick, almost woody, ribs and valves, crowned by the per- 
manent column. Seeds numerous, minute, obovate, with a close 
tunic, not elongated at either end. 
A recent comparison of this with L. ovata has satisfied me of the 
propriety of Mr. Brown's decision respecting its genus, and that 
the arither is no more a terminal lid in one than in the other. 
Neither does the nectary accord so well with Epipactis as with 
Listera.

Root moderately creeping, with simple, downy radicles. Stevis 
several, about 2 feet high, round, copiously leafy ; sheathed at 
the base ; most downy upwards. Leaves broadly ovate, acute, 
bright green, smooth, ribbed and plaited like those of a Veratrum ; 
various in breadth ; sheathing at the base; the upper ones gra- 
dually smaller and more lanceolate ; all thin, rather rigid, not 
at all fleshy. Cluster erect, downy, of n:any alternate droop- 
m^ flowers, on short partial stalks, with a linear-lanceolate 
bractea to each, of which 3 or 4 of the lowermost only reach be- 
yond the flower, the rest being shorter. Germen obovate, downy. 
Cat. and pet. ovate, acute, nearly equal in size and colour, be- 
ing all green, more or less tinged with brown or dull purple. 
Nect. shorter than either, its terminal lobe heart-shaped with a 
small acute point ; the margin entire, a little wavy, purplish ; 
disk tumid, smooth, dull red, or tawny. Anth. strictly terminal, 
broadly elliptical, deflexed, fixed, with 2 close elliptic-oblong 
cells, which deposit their simple yellow pollen-masses on the 
upper edge of the large, angular, prominent stig^na. 

jS, preserved in Buddie's herbarium, is more downy, with later 
powers, of a darker red in every part. 

The Jlowers in Dr. Hooker's plate are of a light purple hue, dif- 
ferent from any I have seen ; their Up somewhat crenate, and 
the germen smooth. A specimen much like this figure, but in 
which the lip is perfectly entire, was sent me from Worcester- 
shire many years ago, as a new species. The reputed varieties 
of E. latifolia perhaps require more scientific examination than 
they have hitherto received. Ehrhart's Serapias parvif'olia, 
Herb. 120, afterwards, as it seems, called by himself, to no pur- 
pose, microphtjlla, Beitr. v. 4. 42, in which change he is followed 
by Swartz, Willdenow and Hoftmann, may possibly be our /3. 
Yet this appears, by my Swiss and Italian specimens, very di- 
stinct from the common E. latifolia. I have never met with it

the lower ones ovate-lanceolate ; upper linear-lanceolate as 
they approach ihejlowers. Cluster a little drooping, at least be- 
fore the flowers expand, cylindrical, dense. Bracteas solitaiy 
under each partial stalk, nearly erect, linear, acute, straight, 
long and narrow, being more than twice the length of the un- 
expanded Jloivers. The latter are numerous, crowded, mostly 
full-grown, but not yet expanded. On immersion in boiling 
water, they prove to have all the characters of an Epipactis, with 
a Up like the foregoing species, quite entire at the margin, and 
somewhat pointed. The calyx is externally downy, as well as 
the germeii. 

Whether my late friend, to whom I am obliged for my only speci- 
men, found any more, I cannot tell, but I hope this account 
may lead to a further discovery of so curious and interesting a 
plant, which cannot be referred to any known species.

Habit like the first species, but the stem not above 12 or 15 inches 
high. Leaves narrower and not plaited ; the lowermost only 
inclining to ovate ; the rest lanceolate, tapering to a point. 
FL fewer, larger, and very handsome. Pet. internally white, 
striped with crimson. Lip longer than the calyx, white, ele-

rounded, or heart-shaped, without a point, concave, strongly 
and unequally notched and crenate, the disk furnished at the 
base with an elevated notched crest. Germen downy. 

Mr. Hudson, from some strange mistake, has asserted that this 
plant, if removed into a garden, or dry .'5oil, changes the fol- 
lowing year to E. latifolia. They are unquestionably perfectly 
distinct species. Linnseus unluckily gave the name oilongifolia 
to this and others confounded with it, because among them are 
some long-leaved species ; but palustris is more suitable, and 
has a prior right.

Perennial. June. 

Root creeping. Stem about a foot high, round, leafy, smooth like 
the rest of the herb. Leaves rather elliptical than lanceolate^ 
sessile, clasping, acute, many-ribbed, not plaited, of a fine 
green ; the uppermost narrowest, and gradually diminishing to 
lanceolate spreading bracteas, longer than the flowers, except 
the upper ones, which are small and narrow, longer than the 
germen, which is slender and without any downiness. FL nearly 
or quite sessile, upright, large and handsome, but perfectly in- 
odorous at all times ; their calyx and corolla equally of a pure 
milk-white, though soon turning brownish, and the whole flower 
is seldom so fully expanded as the rest of the species. The con- 
cave, abrupt, scarcely pointed lip is marked above with three 
principal, and two smaller, yellow, elevated, not wavy, parallel 
lines. 

It does not appear why Swartz changed the -original and expres- 
sive name, grandiflora, for one that is equally applicable to the 
next species. The authority of Linnaeus and Scopoli, to say no- 
thing of others, ought to have been regarded by Willdenow, 
who might well have been corrected in the Hort. Kew.

Perennial. May, June. 

Root rather clustered than creeping, with oblong, or somewhat 
cylindrical, fleshy knobs. Stem above a foot high, leafy from top 
to bottom. Leaves numerous, alternate, imperfectly two-ranked, 
lanceolate, twice the length of the preceding, yet scarcely half 
so broad ; the uppermost tapering to a slender point. The line 
is very decidedly drawn between them and the bracteas, the 
latter, except perhaps the lowermost occasionally, being all very 
minute, not one fourth so long as the germen, sharp-pointed, 
often hardly discernible. Fl. sessile, nearly or quite erect, scent- 
less, pure white in every part, except a yellow protuberance on 
the lip, whose disk bears several white, even, elevated ribs, 
turning yellowish as they fade. Masses of pollen yellow, oblong, 
cloven half way down. Stigma peltate, angular. The lip has the 
rudiment of a spur behind.

Root horizontal/ fleshy, gradually creeping, with numerous fibres. 
Stem erect, above a foot high, sheathed with a few scales at the 
bottom, and bearing higher up several lanceolate, tapering, 
ribbed leaves, above which the stem is more or less downy. 
Bracieas linear-lanceolate, longer than the germen, which is 
downy, not smooth. Fl. sessile, very handsome. Cal. and Pet. 
all directed upwards, ovate, taper-pointed, of a uniform rose- 
colour, as well as the column. Lip slightly protuberant between 
the calyx-leaves behind; in front as long as the calyx, but de- 
flexed ; white, rounded, and doubly lobed, at the sides ; white 
in the disk with several thin, wavy, elevated ribs ; the point 
elongated, tapering, acute, red at the edges. Masses ol pollen 
greyish, oblong, slightly cloven. Stigma peltate, concave. 

The plants composing this very natural genus could be but little 
known to Linnaeus when he so strangely confounded them in 
his Species Plantarum. Haller wrote an elaborate paper on the 
Orchidece, professedly to correct his errors. Hence the present 
genus especially, comprehended under the Linnsean Serapias, 
appears materially improved, in the Sy sterna Naturae and Sy sterna 
Vegetabilium, where Haller's corrections are adopted. Yet the 
labours of these great men have by no means reached perfec- 
tion, either with regard to the discrimination of very dissimilar 
species, or their synonyms. Old authors indeed are so full of 
mistakes respecting the latter, that the greatest attention is re- 
quisite to understand what they mean, and they often misunder- 
stand each other. Recent writers have not been more happy 
as to nomenclature, which they have rather confounded than 
improved.

ovate, or obovate, various in length, rather glaucous, almost

In marshy umbrageous woods in Scotland, but rarely. 

Found in one place only, and there sparingly ; in a moist hanging 
wood, on the south side, near the head of Little Loch Broom, 
Ross-shire. Lighffoot. In Methuen wood, 6 miles 'from Perth. 
Mr. Thomas Bishop, 1804. In a peat bog among willows, a

Perennial. May, June. 

Foot fleshy, of numerous, compound, divaricated, horizontal 
branches, spreading about 2 inches, pale brownish or yellowish, 
the lobes blunt and all distinct, not touching each other. When 
beginning to dry it exhales the sweet and powerful scent of 
Vanilla, which is not entirely lost after the specimens have been 
preserved for 20 years. One root sent by Mr. Maughan in wet 
moss, and so kept in a pot, with plenty of water, blossomed the 
same summer. Leaves none. Stalks solitary, erect, a span 
high, angular, smooth, clothed in their lower half with a few 
distant, tubular, loosely sheathing scales, 1^ inch long. Cluster 
of from 5 to JO drooping, pale yellowish Jiowers, on short par- 
tial stalks, with a very small acute bractea at the base of each 
stalk. Germtn smooth, incurved, bluntly angular. Calyx-leaves 
lanceolate, spreading, greenish with a tinge of red. Pet. lan- 
ceolate, pale yellow, often reddish at the point, converging under 
the upper calyx-leaf. Lip recurved, obovate, with a slight con- 
traction in the middle, below which, towards the base, are two 
shallow rounded lobes, the whole white or pale yellow, more 
or less spotted with red ; the spur not apparent, but Mr. Brown 
conceives it to be entirely united to the base of the lip, and very 
short. Some traces of a spur certainly exist in all the other spe- 
cies. Column yellowish ; convex at the back ; channelled in 
front; crowned with the vertical aw ^/ier in the form of a lid, and 
attached behind as by a hinge. Pollen-masses 2 in each cell, 
" ovate, white." Hooker. Caps, elliptical, with 3 blunt ribs, 
and crowned with the permanent withered flower.

oblong, triangular, furrowed. Style short and stout, 
somewhat compressed, bearing the stamens, and termi- 
nating above them in a dilated, flattish, horizontal lobe, 
or appendage, in the place, as Mr. Brown justly indi-

52 GYNANDRIA— HEXANDRIA. Aristolochia. 

Perennial. June. 

Root tuberous, branching, creeping horizontally, with numerous, 
simple, fleshy, smooth, fibres. Stems solitary, 12 or 18 inches 
high, solid, striated, downy, bearing 3 or 4 large, alternate, 
ovate, rather pointed, slightly downy leaves, clasping or sheath- 
ing at their base ; the uppermost, especially if there be two 
flowers, diminished to a lanceolate bractea. Ft. terminal, 
usually solitary, sometimes two, one above the other, large and 
conspicuous. Calyx-leaves ribbed, ]i inch long, of a singular 
rich and dark brown ; the 2 lowermost combined. Pet. of the 
same colour, rather longer and narrower, slightly wavy. Lip 
tumid, yellow, wrinkled, reticulated with veins, internally spot- 
ted, about an inch long. Appendage to the column elliptical, 
with 2 angles, more or less blunt, at the base ; the extremity 
rounded, with a short inflexed point, which latter is not shown 
in the figures of Mr. Salisbury or Dr. Hooker. Mr. Sowerby's 
figure in Engl. Bot. has been unjustly criticised. It was neces- 
sarily taken from a garden specimen, but will on examination be 
found precisely comformable to nature, as well as to Haller's 
excellent plate, the most correct in detail of any that has been 
given of the present species. The American C. parviflorum is 
totally different.

54 GYNANDRIA— HEXANDRIA. Aristolochia. 

The bitter acrid roots of this genus have, from remote antiquity, 
been celebrated for their stimulating effects on the female con- 
stitution ; and the present species, though dangerously emetic, ' 
seems to have been greatly in use in this country, still retain- 
ing a place in our catalogues of medicinal plants. A singular 
opinion is said to prevail in France, that this ^Aristolochia, if 
abundant in vineyardSj spoils the quality of the wines.

Authors unanimously take this for the itsitXi;, Peplis, of Diosco-

The herb, dried or salted, was preserved by the antient Greeks 
as a powerful purge, like the ttettAoj of the same writer, which 
Dr. Sibthorp, with great probability, referrred to Euphorbia fal-

be referred to this plant, by commentators unacquainted with

Cantharides ; and he further asserts in Fl. Suec. on the authority 
of a Dr. Hagstrom, that the plant, eaten by cattle, gives a dis- 
agreeable smell to meat. Sheep that feed upon it are attacked 
with diarrhoea. The stem is erect, a span high, or more, leafy, 
generally branched at the bottom, and terminated by a large 
green umbel, of 5 branches, each of which divides into 3 others 
which are forked ; the whole copiously furnished with obovate

Few British plants are involved in more confusion than this. Our 
first variety, only 12 or 18 inches high, has been confounded by 
Linnaeus with his E. platyphylla, Jacq. Austr. t.37Q, which is 
Haller's Tithymalus n. 1053, very abundant by road sides in 
Switzerland. This, in every part but the flowers and fruit, is 
so much larger than our's that they can hardly be supposed the 
same. However this may be, our's is precisely the Linnsean 
stricta, first described in the 1 0th edition of -Sz/si. ^aL w. 2. 1049, 
though not in either edition of Sp. PI. Our (3 is the same 
species in a starved condition. It is scarcely credible that Ray, 
or anybody, should have taken this for the large creeping- 
rooted Tithymalus verrucosus of J. Bauhin, v. 3. p. 2. 673, and 
Dr. Robinson's plant, found near York, requires therefore to 



MONOECIA—MONANDRIA. Euphorbia. 65 

be investigated. The following description will identify our 
E. stricta. 

Root small, tapering, zigzag, with several lateral fibres. Whole 
herb light green, somewhat tawny, not black, when dried, quite 
smooth, except a few occasional hairs on the rib of the leaves, 
or of the bracteas, at the back. Stem erect, from 6 to 12 or 1.5 
inches high, straight, round, hollow, very smooth, copiously 
leafy in the upper part, often naked and purplish below. Leaves 
spreading, or deflexed, scattered, sessile, lanceolate approaching 
to obovate, acute, finely but unequally serrated ; dilated in 
some degree at the base, so as to be heart-shaped, or auricled ; 
the lowermost often slightly stalked. Umbel of 5 branches 
in strong plants ; in weaker ones of only 3 or 4 ; each in 3 
subdivisions, once or twice forked, when luxuriant ; otherwise 
simply forked, or scarcely at all subdivided. Several branches, 
once or twice forked, spring from some of the uppermost leaves. 
There is often a solitary^oti'er in the centre of the main umbel, 
whose branches are, as usual, accompanied by an equal number 
of ovate bracteas, all serrated like the partial ones above them, 
which are rather heart-shaped. Nect. 4, roundish, yellow, 
entire. Germ, granulated. Caps, covered with small obtuse 
warts, scarcely more prominent than those of the germen. 
Seeds somewhat lenticular, very smooth, of a brownish lead- 
colour. 

In Fl. Br. the partial bracteas are said to be occasionally hairy all 
over, a mistake arising from some erroneous specimens. Several 
exotic species, allied to this, require elucidation. E. verrucosa, 
Linn. Mant. 2, 393, from the Levant, is very different from the 
original one, and might well be named muricata, in allusion to 
the prickly capsules. 

***** Umbel of 6 or more branches. 

9. E. Esula. Leafy-bratiched Spurge.

Root creeping, woody. Herb smooth, light green, not glaucous. 
Stems 12 or 18 inches high, erect, round, solid, leafy, with several 
lateral axillary, leafy branches, destitute of flowers. Leaves of 
the branches, as well as of the main stem, numerous, scattered, 
on short stalks, linear, inclining to obovate, entire, all uniform. 
Umbel of 8 or 10 branches, which are once or twice forked, and 
there are similar ones from the bosoms of some of the upper 
leaves. Bracteas broadly heart-shaped, entire, with a small 
point. Nect. 4, of a tawny brown, rhomboid, with 2 lateral 
horns. Germen smooth. I have not seen the capsule or seeds, 
which perhaps are rarely perfected, the plant increasing much 
by root.

Root woody, creeping extensively, but not rapidly. Herb smooth, 
smaller in its leaves, bracteas and Jlowers than the preceding, 
from which it differs strikingly in the greater abundance, very 
narrow shape, and more glaucous colour of the leaves of its la- 
teral branches, which though ihey generally bear no flowers, 
often rise above the central umbel in great numbers. The 
branches of the umbel are from 10 to 15, twice forked. Bracteas 
pointless, assuming a beautiful scarlet hue after the flowers 
are past. Nect. 4, yellow, crescent-shaped, correctly distin- 
guished in Engl. Bot. from those of E. Esula. Caps, mostly 
smooth and even, but not unfrequently warty in an early state.

Haller notices the nectaries of this and the last, which he consi- 
ders as affording good distinctive marks of the two species. Yet 
he misquotes Rivinus and Fuchsius. C. Bauhin likewise appears 
to confound these Euphorbice under his Titlujmalus cyparissias,

inches long and one broad, entire, more or less obtuse, and 
often regularly obovate,as in the old wooden cuts ; the youngest 
having hairy midribs. Umbel large, almost constantly of 6 rays, 
which reach but little beyond the large, elliptic-oblong general 
bracteas. The partial bracteas are ovate and much smaller, often 
yellowish, their ribs smooth. Nect. 4, broad and short, inversely

Root branching, knotty, somewhat woody. Herb milky, soft and 
downy. Stems several, rather shrubby, biennial, simple, leafy, 
round ; purple in the lower part when stripped of its leaves ; 
many-flowered above. Leaves scattered, numerous, spreading, 
stalked, entire, oblong or obovate, obtuse. Umbel usually of 
5 or 6 simply forked branches, accompanied beneath by nume- 
rous similar branches, solitary from the bosoms of the paler, or 
purplish, more remote, upper leaves. Bracteas yellowish, pale, 
combined, rounded, pointless, nearly or quite smooth. Nect. 4, 
crescent-shaped, acute, yellow. Caps, elliptical, smooth. 

Sometimes each bractea has a minute point. On this Linnaeus 
founded the character of his original E. sylvatica, which how- 
ever is a very trivial variety. What he afterwards took for syl- 
vatica is segetalis. For ascertaining this I am obliged to my 
friend Prof DeCandolle, and at his persuasion I do not scruple 
to unite amygdaloides and sylvatica, whose descriptions and 
figures are generally much confounded by authors. Haller went 
far enough to discover this ; but declined pursuing the investi- 
gation of numerous species, not natives of either Switzerland or 
Britain, involved in the confusion.

Stems shrubby, perennial, three feet high, or more^ downy, very

Leaves numerous, evergreen, crowded, on winged stalks, spread- 
ing every way, lanceolate, acute, entire, dark green, paler be- 
neath, downy and soft to the touch, though rather more coria- 
ceous than the last ; the upper ones gradually shorter and broader. 
Umbel large, of 12 or 15 downy stiff branches ; besides many 
axillary ones from the uppermost leaves ; each once or twice 
forked. Bracteas of a lighter green, downy, broadly heart- 
shaped, partly pointed ; combined at the base. Nect. 4, cres- 
cent-shaped, obtuse, dark purple. Caps, drooping, of 3 tumid 
hairy lobes. 

The scent of the flowers is powerfully fetid, and disagreeable, 
though the aspect of the plant is not unhandsome. It is evi- 
dently distinct from the last, and from numerous foreign shrubby 
species, which approach it in general habit, but whose nectaries 
are mostly yellow, or reddish, and their leaves smooth.

Z. dentata of Willdenow, separated by him at my suggestion from 
our British plant, was long ago well distinguished by Micheli, 
t. 34./. 2 ; and if he be correct as to the 2 cells of its anther, 
and the toothed stigmas, nothing can be more distinct. It may 
probably be found in England.

72 MONOECIA— TRIANDRIA. Typha. 

Root stout, creeping, furnished with many thick hairy fibres. Herb 
smooth. Stems about 6 feet high, erect, round, solid, perfectly 
straight and simple, without joint or knot, leafy at the very 
bottom only. Leaves several, upright, almost as tall as the stems, 
linear, entire, tapering to a bluntish point; rather convex at 
the back ; slightly concave in front ; their bases sheathing, with 
a blunt membranous edge ; the outer ones short and abortive. 
Catkin terminal, erect, about a foot long, uninterrupted ; the 
barren part longest and thickest while in blossom, and furnished 
with a few scattered lanceolate scales. After the yellow stamens 
have fallen, the fertile part swells, becomes of a dark brown, 
and an inch thick, resembling coarse plush, finally dissolving 
into a mass of innumerable minute seeds, each winged under- 
neath with fine hairs, and carried away by the wind. Haller 
says this downy substance serves to stuff pillows.

Like the T. latifolia in general habit, but much more slender. 
Leaves not half so broad, but more concave ; semicyllndrical in 
their lower part. There is a smooth naked portion of the stem, 
from i an inch to an inch, between the barren and fertile cat- 
kins, and the common receptacle of both is rather scaly, or tu- 
berculated, than hairy. 

The Rev. Revett Sheppard found, in the marshes of Great Oakley, 
Essex, what seems a variety of this species, growing among the 
latifolia, having much thicker /erd/e catkins than such as grew 
in the neighbourhood of Little Oakley unaccompanied by the 
latifolia. The receptacle in these specimens however agrees 
with angustifolia, and there is a naked space above the fertile 
catkin. Mr. Sheppard suspected the pollen of the neighbouring 
large species might have affected these catkins, or it may per- 
haps be conjectured that they were the produce of mule plants.

Much smaller than either of the preceding. Stem very slender, 
about a foot, or foot and half, high. Leaves about a line in 
breadth ; channelled above ; convex beneath ; as tall as the 
stem ; pale and blunt at the point, being rather more tumid in 
that part than the other species. They are accompanied by nu- 
merous broad sheathing scales, the innermost of which are half 
as tall as the stems, and have been taken for leaves. Willdenow 
not having seen a remark to this effect in Engl. Bot. has been 
led to make two species out of one. The barren catkin often 
bears a membranous leaf, or scale, at the base, or at the sum- 
mit. The anthers are short and thick, mostly solitary on each 
/lament. Recept. apparently naked. Fert. catkin short and 
thick, becoming tumid, and oval, as it ripens, frequently inter- 
rupted about the middle ; its upper half is sometimes conti- 
nuous with the barren catkin. Seed with numerous bristles at 
the base of its stalk, I have seen no English specimen of this 
very distinct species ; but the older writers could not possibly 
mistake it, nor would Linnaeus, had he ever examined the plants, 
have confounded it with the last.

Linnseus, Haller and Leers have considered this as a variety of the 
preceding^ but Hudson, Curtis, Ehrhart and succeeding botanists 
have well distinguished them. The present is a smaller plant. 
The intermediate spaces, between the 3 angles, at the base of 
each radical leaf, is flat, not concave, as Curtis, I believe, first 
remarked. The stem is erect, perfectly simple, not branched or 
panicled, the lowermost head oijlowers only being usually ele- 
vated on a partial stalk. Calyx green, or not of so deep a brown 
as in the former. Anthers rather yellower. Stigma long and li- 
near, for the most part solitary.

Fert.Jl. numerous, in the same, or more usually in a dif-

as in the barren fl. Co7: a single, hollow, compressed, 
ribbed, often angular, permanent glume to each floret ; 
contracted, mostly cloven, and often elongated at the 
extremity. Germ, superior, roundish, with 3, rarely but 
2, angles, very smooth. Style 1, terminal, cylindrical, 
short. Stigm. 3, more rarely 2 only, awl-shaped, long, 
tapering, downy, deciduous. Seed the shape of the ger- 
men, with unequal angles, loosely coated with the en- 
larged, either hardened or membranous, permanent 
coi'olla, both together constituting the fruit. 

A very extensive genus of the true Calamarice, distinguished 
from all the rest, as from every one of the Gramina, see 
V. \. 49 and 71, by the presence of a single-valved, 
tumid, finally enlarged or hardened, glume, loosely in- 
vesting the seed, about the proper denomination of which 
botanists are not well agreed. I have hitherto called it 
a tunic {arillus) as apparently belonging to the seed ; for 
an arillus may exist without a seed-vessel. But Mr. 
Brown's having met with it in some barren florets of 
Carex acuta, unaccompanied by any pistil, invalidates 
this opinion ; see his Prodr. v. 1 . 242 ; and I have now 
termed it a corolla, which in this case is synonymous 



MONOECIA— TRIANDRIA. Carex. 77 

with his  perianth. Linnaeus called it a nectary^ which is 
properly, in most cases, an appendage to the corolla. 
The part itself is easily recognised in the flower, and 
along with the seed constitutes the fruit, aiFording a 
most clear and certain generic character, as well as 
excellent distinctions of the species. 
The roots in the genus Carex are, perhaps without excep- 
tion, perennial, mostly creeping ; sometimes fibrous and 
tufted only. Herbage grassy. Stem simple generally 
with three, finely serrated and sharply cutting, angles, 
without knots or joints. Leaves linear, pointed, flat, 
roughish, with similarly cutting edges; their bases more 
or less tubular and sheathing; membranous at the sum- 
mit, often auricled ; the upper ones becoming hracteas. 
Stipulas hardly any. Catkins one or more, variously 
disposed and constructed in the different species ; solitary 
or aggregate, in a very few dioecious ; generally monoe- 
cious. In several the barren and fertile florets occur in 
the same catkin, or in the same general spike. When 
aggregate the catkins, or spikelets, being separately 
bracteated, constitute a spike, rather than a compound 
catkin.

In spongy or muddy bogs, frequent. 

Perennial. June. 

Root tufted, of many slender, smooth, branched fibres. Stems 
from 6 to 1 2 inches high, slender, quadrangular, smooth, leafy 
at the base only. Leaves equally slender and smooth, trian- 
gular, not quite so tall ; sheathing and ribbed at the base, with 
hardly any stipula. Catkin slender when in flower ; subsequently 
its lower half becomes tumid, consisting of fertile^ore^s, the 
upper of barren ones. Scales lanceolate, the lower ones forced 
oft" by the reflexed, triangular, brown, smooth and shhnng fruit ; 
so that WUldenow, as often happens, has altered the specific 
character for the worse, few Carices having scales so deciduous. 
The stamens with us are certainly 3. Stigmas 2. 

The original Linngean name being latin, like the classical generic 

, one, was most unadvisedly translated into Greek by Ehrhart ; 
who being entrusted with the printing of the Suppl. Plant. 
abused that trust, by corrupting the text in this and many other 
instances, to the great displeasure of the younger Linnaeus. 
He therefore ought not to be followed in any such alterations. 

Dr. Wahlenberg informs us, in his Fl. Lajip. 224, that C. pulicaris 
is not found in Lapland, so that n.339 of the Linnaean JFl. Lapp. 
must be either the following species, or C. dioica. I should, 
by the description, take it rather for the following, which Lin- 
naeus in his herbarium mistook for pulicaris.

Perennial. June. 

Root slightly creeping. Stem a foot high, with 3 angles rough in

at the edges and keel, not quite so tall, Spikelets from 4 to 6, 
scarcely more, alternate, of a short, tumid, oval shape, and a 
pale silvery hue ; the upper ones crowded; lowermost now and 
then accompanied by a slender bractea. A few of the lower 
Jlorets barren ; the rest fertile. Scales all ovate, membranous, 
acute, with a green rib not reaching to the point. Fruit broadly 
ovate, rather tumid, finely ribbed, not furrowed, smooth, with 
an undivided point. Seed exactly elliptical, flattened, tipped 
with the permanent style. 

The neat, tumid, pale, silvery-white spikelets readily distinguish

Root creeping, scaly. Stem 1 2 or 18 inches high, hollow, with 
rough angles. Leaves deep green ; roughish at the edges and 
midrib , sheathing at the base. Spikelets usually 5 or 6, rather 
crowded together, alternate, erect, elliptical, greyish, soft to the

touch, larger than in the foregoing, each accompanied at the 
base with an ovate scale, half its own length ; the lower one 
generally with a bristle-shaped bractea, not rising so high as 
the common spike. Florets most of them fertile ; a few of the 
lower ones, in each spikelet, barren. Scales lanceolate, or some- 
what ovate, acute, about the length of the corolla, which is 
rough-edged, scarcely cloven at the summit, its surface becom- 
ing striated as the seed ripens. 
The real C. leporina, certainly, by an original specimen, n. 322 of 
the Linnsean Fl. Lapponica, is an alpine species, but half the 
size of this, with 3 or 4 nearly globular spikelets, and an ovate 
smooth-edged corolla, longer than the scales. It is C. Lache- 
nalii of Schkuhr, t.Y.f. 79. Linnaeus undoubtedly confounded 
both together under n. 837, of Fl. Suec. ed. 2, where the de- 
scription answers to the alpine plant; which therefore I cannot 
but consider as C. leporina, though very sorry to differ from 
Dr. Wahlenberg, who zealously contends for a contrary opinion, 
and calls my leporina by the name of lagopina. Willdenow, 
Schkuhr, and Fl. Dan. t. 294, agree with me ; as did the late 
Mr. Davall, from a comparison of Swiss specimens with the 
Linnsean characters. The question is indeed a matter of fact 
rather than of opinion. 

9. C. tenella. Slender-headed Carex.

Root creeping, very slender, like the whole of the herbage, which 
is smooth, of a pale green. Stems a span high, erect, almost 
capillary. Leaves several, acute, sheathing the lower part of 
the stem, rather above half its height, and about twice its dia- 
meter in breadth. Spike erect, weak, of usually 3 rather distant, 
alternate, sessile, very small, round spikelets, each of 1 or 2 
fertile ^orefs, with ovate, membranous, pale scales, and 2 stig- 
mas ; and one terminal, barren Jloret, with a lanceolate scale, 
and only 2 stamens. Fruit elliptic-oblong, compressed, beaked, 
perfectly smooth all over, without any ribs or furrows, and 
equally convex at both sides ; the beak nearly half as long as 
the seed, somewhat pyramidal, obtuse, entire. Stigmas 2. 

Willdenow and Wahlenberg refer this plant of Schkuhr to C. lo. 
liacea, which differs essentially in having many-flowered spike- 
lets, without bracteas, ribbed fruit, flat on one side, and I be- 
lieve 3 stamens. It is Schkuhr's gracilis, 48. t. E./. 24. Tat 
author appears to have drawn the ripe fruit of his C. tenella,

Root long and thread-shaped, creeping very extensively. Stem 
from 2 to 5 inches high, most generally ascending with a curve, 
nearly round, or bluntly angular, striated, smooth to the touch, 
leafy at the bottom only. Leaves shorter than the stem, linear, 
acute, curved, channelled, smooth. Spikelets sessile, ovate, 
densely crowded into a terminal, brown, somewhat three-lobed, 
head. Bracteas shorter than the spikelets, elliptical, concave, 
membranous, brown with pale edges, slightly keeled. Scales 
like them, but more acute, and flatter. Fertile florets in the 
bottom part of each spikelet, each with a very short style, and 
2 long stigmas. Barren ones above them, rather more nume- 
rous. Slam. 3. Fruit ovate, smooth-edged, with a slightly notch-

On the sandy sea shore in abundance. 

Perennial. June. 

Root very long and cord-like, spreading in the loose sand to a great 
extent, branching at the extremity, and sending out from the 
knots many shaggy fibres. Hence it powerfully binds the sand 
together, forming banks which resist the force of the ocean. 
Stems terminal, solitary, about a foot high, erect, except in a 
driving sand, triangular J rough-edged in the upper part; leafy 
below. Leaves several, flat, rough-edged, taper-pointed, about 
as tall as the stem. Spike erect, IJ or 2 inches long, of many, 
more or less crowded, roundish-ovate, brown spikelets; the upper 
ones consisting almost entirely of barrenjlorets, with 3 stamens; 
lower principally oi fertile ones, with 2 sessile stigmas, the latter 
being always inferior. Scales lanceolate, acute. Fruit ovate, 
ribbed, flattened, bordered in its upper half with a dilated rough- 
edged membrane, and terminating in a cloven beak. There is 
always a bristle-pointed leafy bractea, under one, or more, of the 
lower spikelets. 

Haller's n. 1362, or his 1363, has been occasionally taken for 
C. arenaria, but the son of that distinguished writer assured

Root creeping, running deep into the ground. Stems erect, 12 or 
18 inches high, with 3 rough, unequal angles. Leaves sheath- 
ing the lower part of the stem, but scarcely reaching its sum- 
mit, grass-green, flat, taper-pointed, rough at the edges and 
keel. Spike oblong, bluntish, of a rusty brown, soft, moderately 
compressed, but by no means two-ranked, composed of nume- 
rous ovate acute spikelets, whose u\)\)er Jlorets are barren, lower 
fertile. Several of the lower more distant spikelets, as well as 
one or more at the top, consist almost entirely of fertile Jlorets; 
while the numerous crowded ones in the middle part of the com- 
mon spike or catkin are almost completely barren ; and as these 
wither, leaving the others to ripen seed, they give a peculiar as- 
pect and character to the present species. Bracteas ovate, acute, 
rusty, keeled, with a white membranous margin, often torn ; the 
lowermost with a slender leafy point, not so long as the spike . 
Scales much like the bracteas. Fruit ovate, bordered, rough-

naked, except at the bottom, triangular, striated ; the angles 
more or less rough in their upper part. Leaves narrow, acute,

numerous fertile ones below, ovate when in blossom, afterwards 
globose and more spreading, all rather near together, even the 
lowermost not more than its own length distant from the next. 
This lowest spikdet is ravely somewhat enlarged, or compound. 
Bracteas ovate, membranous, keeled, the bristly point of the 
lower one sometimes rising much above the spikelet. Scales 
ovate, rusty-coloured, pointed, with a green keel. Fruit longer 
than the scales, ovate, green, finally brown, spreading, exter- 
nally convex, with a broad, flat, rough-edged, cloven beak, 
whose points render the whole spike prickly, as the name ex- 
presses. Stigmas 2, long and twisted. 

In some Swiss specimens the fruit is partially elongated, and tu- 
mid J apparently diseased. 

/3 appears to be a variety, caused by dryness of soil, having smaller 
rounder spikelets, all quite simple, and a rather smoother stem. 
Schkuhr represents the beak of the fruit shorter than in our

in his exquisite figures as most other characters.

or greyish, in every stage of their growth. Stems 12 or 18 inches 
high, weak, and partly reclining, with 3 acute rough angles. 
Leaves sheathing the bottom of the stem, and usually rising 
above its summit, rough at the edges and keel. Spike when in 
flower an inch, or inch and half, long, of from 6 to 10, or more, 
sessile, erect, ovate, acute spikeleis, each subtended by an ovate, 
concave, close, membranous bracteu, with a green taper point 
and keel, 2 or 3 of the lowermost bracteas being often length- 
ened out into an extremely slender, rough, capillary appendage. 
The spikelets are rarely in pairs ; the lowermost of all sometimes 
compound. Each consists of several ha.Yrer\ Jlorets, with about 
as many fertile ones below them. As the latter ripen seed, the 
spikelets become roundish, or hemispherical, 3 or 4 of the lower 
ones being widely separated from each other. Scales ovate, or 
lanceolate, membranous, hardly so long as the fruit, which is 
broadly ovate, externally convex, flat or concave witliin, mode- 
rately spreading, not reflexed, pale, with a thick green margin, 
very smooth in every part, except a slight roughness near the 
cloven point of the beak, of ten scarcely perceptible. Stam. 3.

j3 is rather an accident than a variety, having a division, or branch, 
at the bottom of the spike, which perhaps Micheli alone has met 
with. 

The figure in Engl. Bot. is very incomplete, as wanting ihe fruit, 
which in its ripening state clearly distinguishes this species from 
the last. Dr. Wahlenberg unites them, having apparently never 
seen C. divulsa, which though well known to English botanists, 
is rare on the continent. Specimens are in the Linnsean her- 
barium, without any place of growth or name, and I have some 
from Switzerland. Dr. Hooker follows Wahlenberg. Having 
carefully examined the question, I am satisfied, even without an 
appeal to the great names of Ray, Micheli, Hudson, and Good- 
enough.

Root fibrous, tufted, not creeping. Stems straight and firm, 2 feet 
high, leafy in the lower part only, very sharply triangular, with 
compressed, rough, cutting angles ; the interstices concave ; the 
summit about twice as thick as the main stalk of the spike, into 
which it is suddenly contracted. Leaves deep green, taller than 
the stem, rather broad, with a rough keel and edges, to be 
handled cautiously. Spihe twice or thrice compounded, oblong, 
obtuse, erect, 2 or 3 inches long, usually dense, or slightly in- 
terrupted, with several long, taper, rough, spreading bracteas, 
ovate at their base, from the lower part of the spike j but these 
are not constantly protruded. Ultimate spikelets ovate, dense, 
with numerous barren florets above the fertile ones. Scales 
ovate, acute j the lower ones especially rather abrupt, with long 
points. Fruit widely spreading, brown, ovate, ribbed, tapering 
into a flat, serrated beak, notched at the point, but less rigid, or

Ray evidently indicates this species in his Synopsis, ed. 2. 268, 
after his account of our following one, observing that it grows 
in a scattered manner, not in dense tufts. This important cha- 
racter, added to the remarks of the learned Bishop of Carlisle 
and of Mr. Crowe, preclude all doubt of these two species being 
certainly distinct, nor can any one who compares them with due 
attention judge otherwise.

with a serrated, partly fringed, notched beak, which when ripe 
is narrow and abrupt at the base, not broad nor gradually ta- 
pering. 
Ray, and others who have accurately observed this Carex, remark 
that it forms large dense tui'ts, like those of Rushes, safely to be 
walked upon, which is not the case with C. teretiuscula. By this 
mode of growth it gradually changes the most rotten bogs into 
profitable meadows, capaljle at length of producing better her- 
bage. My worthy friend Hooker surely cannot think that 
either science or agriculture are endangered, by plants, so much 
alike, yet so distinct in character and economy, being correctly 
discriminated.

It is remarkable that Linnaeus, after having well determined this 
Carex in his Flora Lapponica, where he records its use to the 
Laplanders, when carded and dressed, as a protection from se- 
vere cold, should have made it a variety of his C. vesicaria ; to 
which indeed it is rather more allied than to our strigosa, but 
nevertheless a most distinct species.

Willdenow has distinguished Micheli's t. 32. f. 5 as a species, by 
the name of C. Michelii, Sp. PL v. 4. 277. It has 5 or 6 fertile 
florets, whence an error has .slipped into the Fl. Br., from which 
Micheli's synonym must be excluded. Curtis quotes this au- 
thor still more erroneously.

This Carex has long puzzled the Swedish as well as Swiss bota- 
nists. It is mentioned by Wahlenberg, Stockh. Trans, for 1803, 
157, (under the name I have adopted from Dr. Swartz,) as the 
same with my binervis, a very different plant. It is C. Mielicho- 
feri of Mr. D. Don in Hooker's Ft. Scot., and 1 have Swiss spe- 
cimens confirming the above references to Haller. The plate 
of FL Dan. t. 1049, having a pointed scale accompanying the 
fruit, formerly misled me to believe that plate might represent 
C. distans ; but it certainly belongs to our present plant, as Mr. 
Davall long ago suggested.

Roots creeping extensively, with long, smooth, pale, branched 
fibres. Stem solitary, 5 or 6 inches high, erect, somewhat tri- 
angular, furrowed, smooth ; leafy at the base. Leaves upright, 
or a little spreading, flat, taper-pointed, smooth, about half the 
height of the stem. Bracteas similar, but smaller, with con- 
siderable, rather swelling, sheaths. Rower-stalks triangular, 
smooth, longer than the sheaths, though shorter than the brac- 
teas. Fertile catkins distant, nearly half an inch long, ovate, 
rather dense, with broad, bluntish, pointless, dark-brown scales ; 
barren one solitary, ovate, with ovate, dark-brown, acute, often 
considerably pointed, scaZes. Slam. 3. Stigm.3. Fruit green 
tinged with brown, ovate, or elliptical, triangular, scarcely ribbed,

is remarkable. ... 

Very distinct from the preceding, though the characteristic marks

are not easily defined. The present resembles, in many re- 
spects, the C. salina ofWahlenberg, JVilld. Sp.Pl. v. 4.301, 
but that has only 2 stigmas, and the catkins are much less 
remote. Having then seen but one poor specimen of either, 
I led my late friend Mr. Don into an error as to the synonym 
of Swartz and Wahlenberg.

is much more related than to C. limosa, especially in its fruit, 
which has 3 equal bluntish angles, with rather concave, smooth

upright, broad, rough-edged, striated, grass-green ; sheathing

hardly any sheaths, but rather a pair of small rounded auricles 
occasionally. Catkins generally four, stalked, uniform, ovate, 
turgid, black, soon drooping or pendulous, many-flowered ; the 
3 lowermost fertile, with stamens here and there, but rarely, in 
some ^ore^5 with pJs^iZs ; the terminal one, in its lower half, 
consisting of barren Jlorets. Scales of all ovate, acute, of a

Other species, as C.pulla and ustulata, appear to have been con- 
founded with this by many continental, as well as British, 
botanists ; and the real atrata, larger than any of them, has 
been- arranged with the widely dissimilar tribe of our second 
section, in spite of its 3 stigmas ; because of the inferior barren 
Jlorets in one of the catkins. That mark indeed keeps it separate 
from all that resemble it; and if always attended to, would have 
prevented many mistakes. Dr. Swartz mistook C. atrata for 
saxatilis; Linnaeus appears to have described the true plant in 
his Fl. Lapponica, along with our ustulata, which last only he 
preserved, attaching pulla to it as a variety.

Root creeping, with stout fibres. Stem nearly upright, about a

broadish, rough-edged, striated. Bractea like them, but smaller, 
auricled at the base, not sheathing. Fertile catkins 2, mostly 
very unequal ; the lower one largest, on a long rough stalk, 
from the base of the bractea, ovate, dense, many-flowered, nearly 
upright ; its scales bluntish, of a rusty black ; barren one erect, 
lanceolate, with dark obtuse scales. Stam. 3. Siigm. but 2, by 
which this species essentially differs from the rest of the alpine

smooth, without angles or ribs, of a brownish black ; pale at 
the base ; beak short, notched. 

Schkuhr's /. 63 is copied from the Linnsean Transactions, where 
the middle catkin, though present in the original specimen now

15 inches high, slender; leafy below ; triangular, the angles 
very acute and rough, in the upper part. Leaves upright, flat, 
lanceolate, sheathing, not half the length of the stem, striated, 
rough at the edges and keel, but not on the upper side. Bracteas 
leafy, not rising above the stem, with long, close, membranous- 
edged sheaths, almost equal to the Jlower-stalks, at least the 
upper ones ; the lowermost stalk being half as long again 
as its sheath. Fertile catkins 2, rarely 3, considerably distant 
from each other, upright, ovate, tawny ; their stalks triangular, 
roughish. Scales ovate, obscurely ribbed, pointed, but never 
awned. Barren catkin mostly single, sometimes 2, cylindrical,

Undoubtedly very distinct from C.Jlava, as well as from distans, 
with both which it has been occasionally confounded, as well as 
with speirostachya, by Britisliand foreign botanists ; so that the

Root black, with many stout fibres, tufted, or slightly creeping. 
Stem generally more or less curved, from 6 to 12 or 18 inches 
high, bluntly triangular, very smooth throughout ; leafy in the 
lower part. Leaves very long and narrow, channelled, recurved j 
rough-edged towards the extremity; sheathing at the base. 
Bracteas like the leaves, but spreading widely, and curved rather 
downward ; angular, furrowed, and very slightly sheathing, at 
the base. Fertile catkins usually 3, near together, erect, 
roundish or ovate ; sometimes one stands remote from the rest ; 
and sometimes they are all elongated and cylindrical. Flower- 
stalks extremely short. Scales small, ovate, rusty, the lower 
ones especially tipped with a minute point, or awn ,• all keeled, 
and often three- ribbed. Stam.3. Stigm. 3. Fruit \onger than

Perennial. June. 

Root fibrous, scarcely creeping. Stem 12 to 18 inches high, weak, 
or reclining, triangular, striated, smooth, except at the very 
summit above the fertile catkins ; leafy at the bottom. Leaves 
lanceolate, flat, short and broad, tapering to a point, rough at 
the edges. Bracteas narrower than the leaves, each with a 
close, striated, cylindrical, smooth sheath, about an inch long. 
F/ou)er-s<a/A;s sometimes entirely inclosed in the 'sheaths, but 
the lowermost are generally longer, triangular and smooth. 
Fertile catkins 2 or 3, with a space of 6 inches, or more, between 
the 2 lowest, all usually elliptic-oblong, various in length if not 
in thickness, erect, blackish or brown rather than tawny. Scales 
ovate, broad, brown speckled with red, having a green 3-ribbed 
keel, and a very distinct, straight, rough point, or awn, varying 
in length, but always sufficient to distinguish the present species 
from its allies, except the following. Barren catkin always 
solitary, erect, cylindrical, obtuse, longer than the rest; its 
scales numerous, obtuse, pointless, rusty. Slam. 3. Stigm. 3. 
Fruit ovate, triangular, uniformly and equally ribbed all over, 
either rough or smooth at the edges of the upper part, in the 
very same catkin, as are likewise the edges of the shortish cloven 
beak, though all are usually smooth. Schkuhr represents them 
always rough, though his figure is otherwise very good. Seed 
obscurely dotted, triangular, equal.

Nearly twice the size of the last, notwithstanding its much more 
dry and barren place of growth. Stem erect, firm, from I5 to 
near 3 feet high, bluntly triangular, and smooth, except at the 
very top, where the angles are sharp and partly rough. Leaves 
erect, flat, broadish, taper-pointed, ribbed, of a deep, though 
glaucous, green ; rough at the edges, and partially so at the 
keel ; very rough at the triangular point ; their sheaths smooth, 
about half the length of the leaf itself, or more. Bracteas like 
the leaves, but smaller and narrower, with smooth sheaths of 
about the same proportion ; the upper one short, though equal 
to the adiommgjlower. stalk. The other Jlower-stalks are longer 
than their sheaths, all triangular and roughish. Fertile calkins 
3 at least, the 2 lowermost not above 3 or 4 inches asunder, in 
which they accord with the usual proportion of other species, 
not with C. distans ; all cylindrical, erect, blackish j often di- 
vided, or slightly compound, at the base j often consisting of 
barren^ore^s, for nearly half their length, at their summits. 
Scales like those of the last, with similar rough awns. Barren 
catkin mostly solitary, erect, above an inch long, cylindrical, 
dense ; its scales very numerous, pointless, dark brown, with a 
pale keel ; but there are often a few harrer\ Jlorets at the point 
of several fertile ca^/cJHs. Stam.3- Stigm.3. irwii ovate, un- 
equally triangular, a little compressed, smooth, with a short, 
broad, deeply cloven, scarcely rough-edged, beak; the inner 
surface concave, pale, streaked with several equal purplish ribs j 
outer convex, paler, with a central prominent angle or keel, and 
2 very distinct, elevated, smooth, green ribs towards the mar- 
gin, though totally distinct from it, found perhaps in some other 
species, quite unlike this, but not in any which, properly exa- 
mined, can be confounded with it, especially C. distans.

over in the 3d edition. — Linnaeus, in like manner, adopted it 
from Plukenet's figure alone, while he described at the same 
time a specimen of the same, by the name of montana. That 
of pilulifera has been generally retained. It alludes to the glo-

Root creeping, with scaly shoots, and long shaggy fibres ; the 
scales, as well as those that envelop the leaves and stems at the 
base, of a deep blood-red brown. Stems erect, a foot or more 
in height, with 3 sharp angles rough upwards ; leafy at the bot- 
tom only. Leaves of the present year not one third the height 
of the stem, erect, acute, flat, grass-green, somewhat hairy, 
rough-edged, ribbed. Bracteas leafy, scarcely rising above the 
stem ; the sheath of the lowermost extremely short ; of the rest 
hardly any. Fertile catkins commonly 2, often one only, 
nearly or quite sessile, dense, erect, oblong, obtuse ; the lower- 
most cylindrical, seldom an inch long ; the rest shorter, ellip- 
tical, but never so crowded, rounded, or spreading as in C. pi- 
lulifera ; their scales ovate, broad, acute, brown, with a dilated, 
pale midrib. Barren catkin longest, lanceolate, tumid, erect, 
with pale, rusty, obtuse scales ; its upper half very rarely com- 
posed of fertile florets ; but it is usually quite solitary and dis- 
tinct. Stam. 3. Stigm. 3, sessile. Fruit globular, with 3 
very slight, brown angles, a little flattened, green, clothed with

Root creeping. Stems about a foot high, upright, striated, smooth, 
with 3 blunt angles. Leaves chiefly towards the root, glaucous, 
rough-edged, flat, erect, half the height of the stem ; their keel 
smooth, except near the summit. Bracteas erect, leafy, with 
long pale sheaths. Fertile catkins usually two, about an inch 
long, erect, rather distant, linear j the lowermost lax and elon- 
gated, especially in its lower part, standing on a slender trian- 
gular stalk, twice as long as the sheath ,- the upper one more 
dense, with a shorter stalk, and smaller bractea. Scales ovate, 
acute, dark-brown, with a narrow white edge and green keel.

In moist meadows, pastures, groves, and wet barren heathy 
ground, common. 

Perennial. May, June. 

Root creeping, sheathed with purplish-brown scales. Herbage 
glaucous, very conspicuous in moist as well as dry weather. 
Stem erect, from 8 to 18 inches high, roundish with 3 angles, 
scarcely rough in any part. Leaves mostly radical, upright, or 
partly recurved, broad, acute, rough-edged, not half so tall as 
the stem, much resembling the foliage of pinks or carnations. 
Bracteas leafy, the lowermost several inches long; their sheaths 
short, crowned with rounded brown auricles. Fertile catkins 2, 
often 3, cylindrical, obtuse, many-flowered, veiy dense, droop- 
ing as they ripen, and at length pendulous, each on a slender 
smooth stalk, many times longer than its sheath. Scales ovate> 
more or less acute ; bluntish and entirelypointless, in thevariety 
/3 3 their colour like chocolate, with a greenish rib. Barren catkin 
generally solitary, but very often accompanied by a smaller 
one, and the upper portion of several of the fertile catkins fre- 
quently consists of barren florets ; ^ is remarkable for having 4 
completely barren catkins, with half another ; though only one, 
compound at the base, consisting entirely of fertile florets. 
Scales of the barren catkins usually obovate and obtuse, dark 
brown with a yellow rib ; sometimes they are partly acute, and 
even pointed. Starn.3. Stigm. 3 , on a, shoxt stijle. Fruit gI-

short, triangvilar, dark brown with pale angles.

B has smooth fruit, which in this case appears to constitute no 
specific difference. 

By the description this is shown to be a very variable species. 
Yet it is not the only one which varies in the number of the 
barren catkins, or in having some barren Jlorets at the top of 
the fertile catkins, which latter circumstance occurs in the last 
described. 

With regard to its name, the Carex in question has been unfortu- 
nate. It was first called ^acc« by Schreber, and, in the year 
following, glauca by Scopoli. Hudson ought to have retained 
one of these, had he been informed of them, when he first de- 
scribed the plant in his 2nd edition ; but he took the appellation 
of recurva from Morison's synonym. I might now perhaps have 
attempted to restore ^acca, as most prevalent on the continent; 
but as Willdenow has sanctioned recurva, and he is one of the 
best writers upon this genus, this name, being in itself unex- 
ceptionable, may as well remain.

remarkably firm and rigid. Stems solitary, mostly curved, 
sometimes erect, from 3 to 6 inches high, ti-iangular, striated, 
leafless, except at the base ; the angles smooth in their lower 
part, rough upwards. Leaves numerous, shorter than the stems, 
more or less recurved, linear-lanceolate, pointed, flat, broader 
than in most of the neighbouring species, rough at the edges 
and keel, slightly glaucous ; their sheaths permanent, closely 
crowded, strongly ribbed, becoming bleached, and polished, em- 
bracing each other. Bracteas leafy, lanceolate, recurved, about 
an inch long ; the upper ones minute; sheaths none, though 
there are generally two rounded brown auricles at the insertion 
of each bractea. Fertile catkins 2 or 3, ovate-oblong, obtuse, 
dense ; the uppermost nearly or quite sessile, close together at 
the foot of the barren one j the lowermost at a little distance, 
on a stalk half its own length, erect. Scales elliptic-oblong, ob- 
tuse, pointless, dark-brown, with a pale yellowish rib. Barren 
catkin mostly solitary, thick, obtuse, with rusty, obtuse, torn 
scales. Stam.3. Siigm. only 2, nearly sessile. Fruit crowded, 
elliptical, moderately compressed, obscurely triangular, smooth, 
ribless, longer than the scales, pale green, the exposed part 
brown ; the summit tipped with a very short, blackish, cylin- 
drical, abrupt, entire beak, often scarcely discernible. Micheli 
exhibits the occasionally recurved point of the fruit, noticed by 
the Bishop of Carlisle. 
The above synonyms evince that this species has not remained 
unknown to foreign botanists, and that none of them ever 
thought of confounding it with C. ccespitosa. Many have indeed 
mistaken it for saxatilis, which the Linnsean herbarium shows 
to be totally different. After such authorities as Mr. Hudson, 
Mr. Dickson and the learned Bishop of Carlisle, my own opi- 
nion in support of this species, formed when I gathered it 45 
years since, and now confirmed, is perhaps superfluous ; nor do 
I insist upon it from any disrespect for my valued friend Dr. 
Hooker.

Root creeping, but short, composing dense entangled tufts, which 
gradually become firm, so as to be walked upon, like C. pani- 
culata, n. 20 ; and not at all resembling the long straggling 
roots of C. rigida. The plant is well known in Sweden for its 
property of filling up boggy ground, changing it to green mea- 
dows, of which Linnaeus gives a remarkable account, Fl. Suec. 
ed. 2. 333. Stems erect, from 6 to 12 inches, or more, in height, 
leafless except at the bottom, triangular, striated ; the angles 
rough in the upper part only. Leaves numerous, shorter than 
the stems, quite straight and upright, soft and flexible, linear, 
acute, bright-green, scarcely glaucous, rough at the edges and 
keel, about one third the breadth of the foregoing ; their sheaths 
less remarkably permanent, of a dark red brown. Bracteas leafy, 
erect, narrow and tapering, from 1 to 3, or even 6 inches in 
length ; without any sheaths, but accompanied at the base by a 
pair of rounded, short, dark-brown auricles, very variable in 
size, but never elongated. Fertile catkins almost invariably 3, 
sessile, a little distant, erect, cylindrical, obtuse, dense and 
thick, an inch long, seldom so shortened as to become ovate ; 
the lowermost, in some foreign specimens at least, very lax in 
its lower part, and supported by a long slender stalk. Scales 
obovate, obtuse, black, with a narrow green rib. Barren catkin 
mostly single, rarely accompanied by a small one at a little 
distance, erect, lanceolate, acute, about an inch long, formed of 
numerous, crowded, obtuse, dark-brown scales. Stam. 3. Siigm. 
2, nearly sessile. Fruit longer than the scales, elliptical, broad, 
compressed almost flat, green, smooth, ribbed on both sides, 
having no central longitudinal angle at the inner side, so as to 
be even bluntly triangular, but instead of it there is a double 
keel, or thickened margin, at one of the edges. This affbrds of 
itself an essential diff'erence from the last. Beak extremely 
short, brownish, abrupt, or minutely cloven. Seed compressed. 
The fruit is observed by the Bishop of Carlisle to remain on the 
stalk till it is quite ripe, and even decayed, which is not the 
case with the following. It is usually set in 6 rows, rarely in 8,

the stems, the lower ones membranous, torn and reticulated at 
the edge of their sheaths, which soon splits into entangled 
threads, forming a kind of loose network. Bracteas leafy, 
erect, taper-pointed j the upper ones very small, somewhat di- 
lated and membranous at the edges, but without the dark 
rounded auricles of C. ccespitosa. Fertile catkins from 1|- to 2 
inches long, all nearly or quite sessile, always upright, cylin- 
drical, dense and many-flowered, most of them pointed, having 
more or less of their upper part composed of barren Jlorets. 
Scales obtuse, dark-brown, with a green rib. Barren catkins 
often 2, besides the above-mentioned portions of the fertile ones, 
an inch or two in length, with innumerable, obtuse, dark -brown 
scales. Stani. 3. Sligm. 2, with astyle nearly their own length.

Mr. Davall observes that C. stricta, by means of its matted roots, 
forms islands in the Swiss lakes or pools, probably like the tufts 
of C. cmspitosa, on a larger scale.

Root creeping extensively, with whitish horizontal runners, very 
difficult of extirpation. Stems commonly 2 or 3 feet in height, 
in a starved state sometimes but 3 or 4 inches, having 3 rough 
angles ; drooping at the summit while in flower only, but sub- 
sequently quite erect. Leaves sheathing the base of the stem in 
three rows, of a bright deep green, not glaucous, upright, 
drooping at the extremity, shorter than the stems, rough at the 
edges and keel. Bracteas leafy, tapering, without sheaths, 
though often minutely auricled j the first or second overtopping 
the stem. Fertile catkins 3 or 4, nearly, if not quite, sessile, 
except the lowermost, all a little inclining while in flower, cy- 
lindrical, slender, li or 2 inches long, dense, many-flowered, 
commonly with a few barren^ore^s at the summit. Scales lan- 
ceolate, acute, black, with a pale rib. Completely barren cat- 
kins 2 or 3, about the size of the fertile ones, with lanceolate, 
bluntish, dark scales. Stam.3. Stigm. never more than 2, by 
which, as the Bishop of Carlisle and Mr. Curtis long since re-

compressed, ribbed, smooth, green, with partial stains of brown, 
deciduous ; beak short, cylindrical, abrupt, entire. Seed small, 
obovate, compressed, not triangular. 

Linnaeus, having quoted, with commendation, for this Carex Mi- 
cheli's t. 32./. 12, which has no character in common with it, 
except the numerous barren catkins, and which really belongs 
to C. recurva, re. 48, some of the most able botanists have been

its darker, less glaucous, herbage, tumid fruit, and pointed 
scales of both kinds of catkins. From all these species it differs 
in its greater size. 

The root is thick and long, creeping extensively. Stem a yard or 
more in height, erect, firm, with 3 sharp, very rough angles. 
Leaves broad, upright, rough at the edges and keel, deep green, 
with very little of a glaucous hue. Bracteas like them, rising 
above the stem, with" very short sheaths, and pale rounded au-

rides, not always present. Barren catkins from 3 to 5, crowded, 
triangular, sharp-pointed 5 their scales lanceolate, taper-pointed, 
more or less awned, strongly keeled, of a uniform dark brown, 
rather downy. Fertile catkins 3 or 4, erect, stalked, thick, cy- 
lindrical, pointed, especially when tipped with a few barren_^o- 
retsj their scaZes ovate, smooth, tapering into along, sharp, 
rough, awn. Stam. 3. Stigm. 3. Fruit ovate, triangular, pale 
brown, smooth, finely ribbed, tumid, inflated, not compressed 
like the last, terminating in a broad, shortish, deeply cloven 
beak, with 2 sharp distant points. Seed small, whitish, trian- 
gular. 
Haller's n. 1404 is commonly taken for this plant, and it is possi- 
ble he might have had it in view, along with some of our last- 
described, under that number, as well as under his 1398 and 
1399. Neither this eminent writer, noi Linnaeus, was well ac- 
quainted with these common Carices, Mr. Curtis being the first 
who well explained them. The late Mr. Davall, from whom 1 
have Swiss specimens of the riparia, thought Haller had it not, 
though he has referred to its synonyms, intermingled with those 
of other species. If the fruit, and the awns of the scales, be at- 
tended to, no mistake can be made.

Root creeping. Stem 1 or 2 feet high, with 3 blunt angles, smooth, 
except above the lowermost bractea. Leaves narrower than the 
foregoing, erect, somewhat glaucous, acute, rough at the edges 
and keel near the extremity. Bracteas very narrow, with no 
sheaths, except the lower one. Barren catkins 2 or 3, much 
like the last ; fertile with similar short stalks, but otherwise very 
different, nearly twice as long, and scarcely above half so thick, 
upright; their sraZes lanceolate, acute. Stam.3. Stigni. 3, with 
a longish style. Fruit copious and crowded, longer than the

sessile, elliptical with 3 angles, crowned with the style. 

The fruit of this species resembles a bottle or flask, ampulla ; that 
of the last a bladder, vesica ; so that they ought never to have 
been confounded in character or name / to say nothing of the 
totally different shapes of their catkins when ripe.

Perennial. May, June. 

Root creeping extensively, with long, stout, scaly runners, and 
densely shaggy radicles. Whole herb clothed, more or less co- 
piously, with fine, soft, shaggy hairs, which the Bishop of Car- 
lisle has observed occasionally to disappear almost entirely, in 
wet situations, except at the top of the sheaths of the leaves, 
never quite smooth, and usually thickly bearded. Stem erect, 
2 feet high, leafy, with 3 sharp rough angles. Leaves scarcely 
so tall, upright, flat, rough-edged, pointed, most hairy beneath. 
Bracteas like the leaves, their sheaths, which are often smooth, 
embracing nearly the whole of eachjlower-stalk. Barren cat- 
kins 2 or 3, lanceolate, erect, light brown, their filmy-edged 
scales pointed ; lower ones awned ; fertile 2 or 3, distant, stalk- 
ed, erect, cylindrical, or somewhat ovate, about an inch long ; 
their scales ovate, smooth, membranous, keeled, with long, slen- 
der, rough awns. Stam. 3. Stigm. 3. Fruit ovate, tawny, 
ribbed, always, I believe, hairy, tumid all round, though scarcely 
inflated ; the beak broad, rough, deeply cloven, acute. Seed 
roundish, with 3 angles, tipped with part of the stijle. 

The separate catkin in Fl. Dan. t.379, which has been thought to 
belong to this species, may perhaps be C. Jiliformis, like the 
principal figure. Schkuhr having rightly determined the ano- 
nymous plate t. 425 of that work to be C. hirta, renders the 
other less important. Plukenet's t. 34. f. 6, must be intended 
for this, though the leaves answer better to C. Jiliformis. 

A specimen of Schkuhr's variety, our /3, gathered in Yorkshire by 
Mr. Turner, has not only the lower part of each fertile catkin

Root apparently creeping, with stout, dark brown, reddish, branch- 
ed fibres. Herbage naked. Stems a foot high, or more, erect, 
with 3 very smooth angles ; leafy below. Leaves linear, flat, 
ribbed, rough-edged, pointed, rather narrow, resembling those 
of the last, but not hairy. Bracteas like the leaves, very long, 
with naked smooth sheaths, from 1 to 2 inches in length. Barren 
catkins 2, often solitary, slender, with obovate, blunt, filmy 

  scales ; fertile 3 or 4, the uppermost often near together j in p 
aggregate ; the lower one, or two, very remote ; all on stalks 
concealed by the sheaths of the bracteas, erect, short, thick, with 
ovate acute scales, pale and thin at their edges. Stam. 3. 
Stigm. 3. Fruit large, ovate, with a thin rough edge ; convex 
and strongly ribbed externally, without any hairiness ; deeply 
concave at the inner side, being so greatly compressed as to 
have no considerable cavity, by which character it essentially 
differs from C. hirta, the beak, moreover, being longer, narrower, 
rough at the edges, and somewhat membranous at the orifice. 
Seed obovate-oblong, triangular. 

My liberal friend Mr. W. Robertson of Newcastle favoured me with 
specimens of this, among Mr. Drummond's Scottish discoveries, 
under the name of C. hordeiformis, on the authority of a French 
botanist. It may be that species, of which we know nothing but 
from a figure of Villars, copied in Schkuhr, t. D, d, A,f. 121. I 
have most of the plants of Villars, an excellent and original au- 
thor, though his figures are bad; but unluckily I cannot find a 
specimen of his Carex in question. I think there can be no 
doubt of its being the same as C. secalina, Schkuhr having ac- 
tually seen the latter only.

Perennial. June, July ? 

Root creeping extensively, with brown scaly runners, much like 
C. hirta. Stem erect, about a foot high, triangular, smooth j 
leafy in its lower half. Leaves erect, linear-lanceolate, pointed, 
flat, the breadth of C. hirta, but quite naked and smooth, ex- 
cept a roughness at the edges and keel near the extremity ; the 
under surface rather glaucous ; the sheaths long, close and 
abrupt. Bracteas leafy, as tall as the stem, very slightly, or not 
at all sheathing at their base, destitute oi auricles. Barren cat- 
kins 2, rather distant, erect, linear, obtuse, the upper, or largest, 
near an inch long } scales obovate, obtuse, pointless, dark brown, 
with a pale rib. Fertile catkins 2, not more distant than the 
barren ones, ovate, not Vialf an inch long, erect, each on a stout 
triangular stalk, about its own length j scales ovate, dark brown, 
each with a very strong, green mid-rib, ending in a shortish, 
stout, rather blunt point, or awn. -S/igm. 3, almost sessile. 
Fruit shorter than the scales, roundish-obovate, somewhat tri- 
angular, a little compressed, greenish, or tawny, smooth, all 
over finely besprinkled with minute, brown, or reddish, depress- 
ed dots } its termination very abrupt, without any beak. Seed 
not observed. 

In general appearance this plant much resembles C. nutans of 
Host, mild, V. 4. 299 ; but the fruit of that species is ovate, 
tapering into a broad, deeply cloven, beak, and the scales of the 
barren, as well as fertile, catkins, are more or less awned. The 
fruit of ours rather agrees with that of C. rigida, or recurva, and 
its habit perhaps with pulla, globularis, and their allies ; but the 
2 very distinct barren catkins, however exceptionable that cha- 
racter may occasionally prove, oblige us to refer C. stictocarpa 
to the present section, which its agreement, in some points, 
with hirta and filiformis may further justify. I have seen but a 
single specimen.

Of this I have seen but one specimen, and that none of the best. 
The herbage is of a very slender habit, and smooth. Stem tri- 
angular, 15 inches high, leafy at the bottom only. Leaves not 
quite so tall, erect, linear, acute, extremely narrow, channelled, 
or involute, at least when dry. Bracteas leafy, but flatter, 
reaching nearly to the sumnut of the stem, without sheaths, or 
auricles. Barren catkins 2, the uppermost stout, obovate, ob- 
tuse, i an inch long ; the other ovate, much smaller ; their 
scales obovate-oblong, pointless, dark chesnut-coloured, with a 
pale rib. Fertile catkin at a little distance below, on a shortish 
stalk, erect, ovate, ^ of an inch long, with similar scaZes, Stam.

The leaves approach C. nardifolia, Willd. v. 4. 304 ; the fruit and 
scales C. stricta; but the stigmas are unfortunately wanting. I 
cannot refer this Carex to any described species, though in many 
particulars it is not very remote from the following. Their 
fruits however are altogether dissimilar.

I have been inclined to suppose that Plukenet's t. 34. /. 6 was 
taken from this species, which its leaves resemble much more 
than C. hirta; but it is more probable his drawing was incor- 
rect. The separate catkin, in Fl. Dan. t.379, may as well be- 
long to the plant there delineated, which is certainly C. Jllifor- 
mis, as to hirta, not agreeing well with either.

A small tree, of very slow growth. Leaves ovate, hardly an inch 
long, dark shining green, turning to a vivid tint of vermilion in 
autumn j concave and paler beneath. Stipulas none. Foot- 
stalks, as well as the young branches, more or less downy. Fl. 
pale yellow, or cream-coloured, tufted, variable in the number 
of their petals. 

Box wood is yellowish, hard, heavy, of a firm close texture, not lia- 
ble to split. Hence its value for making mathematical instru- 
ments ; and, above all, for engraving in wood ; an art so exqui- 
sitely improved of late in this country, as to have almost tb^ 
merit of a new invention.

armed with venomous perforated bristles, each of which

slight pressure of the hand, is transmitted into the skin, 
causing great irritation. Most of the numerous exotic 
species have not this stinging property.

MONOECIA— HEXANDRIA. Eriocaulon. ISO 

Perennial. May — September. 

Root large, fleshy, white, subdivided below, of a very acrid purga- 
tive quality. Stems herbaceous, annual, rough, leafy, more or 
less branched, climbing by their tendrils to the height of several 
feet. Leaves 3 or 4 inches broad, with 5 angular lobes, rough 
all over with minute callous tubercles ; if slightly rubbed, in 
autumn, they exhale a musky scent. FZ. white, with elegant 
green ribs and veins, on panicled, or imperfectly umbellate, 
axillary stalks ; all barren on one plant ; fertile on another ; at 
least for the first 2 or 3 years ; but Miller observed that older 
roots produced both sorts of blossoms, on the same plant, as is 
proper to all the other known species of this genus. Berries 
scarlet, fetid when bruised. Sometimes every filament bears a 
double anther. 

The true B. alba of Linnaeus, found on the continent, has black 
fruit, being called alba from its white root, in contradistinction 
to Tamus, the Black-rooted Bryony.

Aquatic herbs, chiefly extraeuropaean, first properly under- 
stood by Mr. Brown, to wliose Prodromus, and Dr. 
Hooker's dissections, we are indebted for the above im- 
proved characters of this genus. I have removed it to 
Monoecia Hexandria, the number 6 appearing to be the 
most complete in its corolla and starnens, though these 
parts, in some species, lay aside one third, according to 
the analogy of other monocotyledonous plants, and the 
flowers then become tetrandrous, as in our only species. 
No genus can be more natural, but the very numerous 
species are so much alike, and require such minute exa- 
mination, that a competent character of any of them is 
very difficult.

First observed in the isle of Skye by Mr. Robertson, in 1 768, ac- 
cording to Dr. Hope j but by the Rev. Dr. Walker's herbarium, 
in Mr, Maughan's possession, it appears to have been discovered 
there, Sept. 11,1 764, by Sir John Macpherson, along with Dr, 
Walker, in a small lake by the road from Sconsar to Giesto. See 
Hook. Scot. In all the lakes and ditches about Cunnamara, 
Ireland. Mr. J. T. Mackay. 

Perennial. September. 

Roots creeping, with numerous, long, white, finely jointed radicles, 
matted together in dense tufts, so as to form floating islands. 
Leaves radical, numerous, channelled, smooth, 2 or 3 inches 
long, tapering gradually from a broadish base, to a capillary 
point, ail finely cellular internally. Stalk 3 or 4 times as tall, 
with a tubular sheath at the base, solitary, simple, naked, a little 
twisted, having about 7 angles, occasionally more or less, with 
flat interstices. FL. solitary, terminal, almost globular, like a 
vyhite double daisy, though not half so large, finely downy, 
tinged with purple. Anthers prominent, dark violet.

This genus is supposed by some botanists to be monocoty- 
ledonous, though Jussieu suspected otherwise, and Gaert- 
ner has plainly shown it to have 2 very distinct cotyle- 
dons., which he chose to call a vitellus, taking the many- 
cleft embryo, or pliimula, for cotyledons. The appearance 
of this latter part seems to have led M. Richard to think 
the genus allied to the Conifei-ce ; but if it had really 
many-cleft cotyledons, like Pinus, that circumstance 
would only prove such a character worthless, as to real 
natural affinity. See Lindley in HooJc. Scot. p. 2. 297.

Like the foregoing, but Vaillant observed the leaves to be smoother, 
and more divided, having eight segments in all, instead of four. 
These characters are certainly inconstant. The presence or 
absence of spines on the fruit, and the segments of the calyx 
being, as Mr. Sowerby first discovered, sharp and entire, not 
toothed, are surely sufficient distinctions. Willdenow declares 
his decided opinion that they are not varieties of each other, 
though he found the segments of the leaves in both species finely 
•serrated at the ends.

Gaertner observes that this genus is evidently dicotyledo-

Perennial. July, August. 

Root tuberous, nearly globular, with many long fibres, and throw- 
ing out bulbiferous runners, as observed by Mr. L. Wigg. Herb 
milky, smooth. Leaves on long, triangular, very cellular /oo<- 
stalks, shaped like the head of an arrow, with two sharp lobes 
pointing downward, and one upward, the latter occasionally less 
acute. Nothing is more variable than the breadth and size of 
the leaves, which are diminished almost to nothing when deeply 
immersed in the water, or exposed to a rapid current. Hence 
the above varieties mentioned by authors, but which the slight- 
est observation will discover to be evanescent. Fl. 3 in each 
whorl, with combined bracteas at the base of their partial stalks. 
Pet. snow-white, with a violet claw, quite distinct from the 
calyx, and falling off while that remains. Yet the great Jussieu 
decrees these petals to be the inner leaves of the calyx, because 
the plant is monocotyledonous ; but surely this is no less erro- 
neous than in the Orchidece. It teaches no truth, for it is an 
arbitrary violation of common sense. 

This species of Sagittaria appears to be a native of China and the 
East Indies, as well as of Europe, and perhaps of North Ame- 
rica likewise. Representations of it, that cannot be mistaken, 
often occur on oriental porcelain, associated with the conse- 
crated Cyanius, or Sacred Bean, whose history is given in Exot, 
Bot. V. 1 . 59. The late Mr. Payne Knight, so distinguished for 
his profound learning, suggested to me, that, as the Cyamus is 
an acknowledged emblem of fertility and reproduction, the Ar- 
row-head indicates the contrary, or a destroying power. They 
are the egg, and the anchor, or arrow-head, so general in archi- 
tectural ornaments.

Tree. April. 

A large, umbrageous, very handsome tree, with round, smooth, 
leafy, more or less wavy, branches. Leaves deciduous, alternate, 
on short stalks, smooth, bright green, unequally cut into paral- 
lel, bluntish, entire, marginal lobes, with rather acute sinuses, 
and furnished with a .single mid-rib, sending off veins into the 
lobes. Barren^, in numerous, pendulous, stalked, yellowish, 
downy, deciduous catkins, 2 inches long, from lateral scaly buds. 
Fertile on axillary simple stalks, few, scattered, sessile, lateral, 
small, greenish tinged with brown ; their outer calyx subse- 
quently much enlarged and hardened, constituting the well- 
known permanent cup of the smooth, finally deciduous, nut, or 
acorn, which last is crowned by the small, chaffy, converging 
inner calyx. 

Acorns, the noted food of hogs, are eaten likewise by pheasants ; 
probably by turkeys in a half domesticated state. We have 
known a considerable number taken out of the crop of one 
pheasant, which, on being planted, grew. The value of the «/)oorf, 
as the most useful for all the most important purposes, is well 
known. When finely veined, it is no less ornamental. This 
species of Oak, affording the best, strongest, and most lasting 
timber, received from Linnaeus the classical name of Robur, ap- 
propriated to the hardest and best kind of Oak. How Willde- 
now came to misapply this specific appellation to the following, 
or worst kind, and why he is countenanced in this wilful error 
in the Hort. Kew., contrary to the knowledge of all botanists, 
I am not able to give any satisfactory reason. Reichard seems 
the original cause, in the misapplication of the references to Lin- 
naeus, in his Syst, Plant, v. 4. 1 63.

Tree. April, May. 

The wood of this species being far inferior to the true Q. Robur in 
quality, it is highly important to distinguish them, though long 
considered as varieties. The leaves of the present have longer, 
more slender, footstalks, and are more equally and regularly 
pinnatifid ; in the variety j3 they are downy underneath, and 
generally thought more lasting, or inclined to be evergreen. 
The most clear and indisputable specific character, noticed by 
the older writers, consists in the fertile flowers having little or 
no stalks, which difference exists likewise in the Acorns. Those 
writers however do not appear to have been aware of the infe- 
rior value of the timber. Professor Martyn has given some re- 
marks on this subject, highly worthy of notice.

Tree. May. 

A stately and majestic tree, rivalling^ if not exceeding, the British 
Oak in size and duration. The bark is remarkable for its deep 
and wide clefts, which seem to have furnished ideas for some 
ornaments in Gothic architecture. Branches widely spreading ; 
round and smooth when young. Leaves near a span long, el- 
liptic-lanceolate, acute, smooth, with many transverse veins, 
ending in sharp serratures ; of a rich shining green above ; paler 
beneath. Barren catkins numerous, axillary, solitary, yellow, 
pendulous, almost as long as the leaves, deciduous. Fl. ranged 
along the common stalk in lateral sessile tufts. Stam. numerous, 
spreading. Fert.^. much fewer, on terminal stalks, which are 
lengthened out as the fruit advances. Styles about 6, with long, 
smooth, upright stigmas. Geertner detected about 12 scarlet

Nuts large, broadly ovate, generally 2, flat on the inner side, 
attached by a broad scar to the bottom of the greatly enlarged 
outer calyx, whose outside is copiously armed with complicated 
sharp prickles. 
Chesnuts afford a wholesome and grateful food to many quadru-

Tree. April, May. 

A handsome umbrageous tree, with a smooth bark, and shining 
leaves, which remain during winter, in a dry state, on the 
branches, and are very long in decaying after their fall. Hence 
they form a thick bed, through which grasses, and herbaceous 
plants in general, perhaps, do not readily penetrate j though 
Orchidece ,anA some parasitical vegetables, flourish most in Beech 
woods. Seedlings of this tree, with their pale cotyledons, look 
not unlike some kinds of Fungus. The leaves are 2 or 3 inches 
long, slightly and unequally serrated, with a silky marginal 
fringe, and downy veins. Barr.^. brown, 3 or 4 in each round. 
Stalked, drooping head, or catkin. Fertile ones above them, so- 
litary, on stouter stalks. Cal. of the fruit 4-cleft, clothed with 
simple pliant prickles. Stigmas 3 in each flower, spreading, 
acute, downy. Nuts 2, with 3 equal, very sharp, angles, and 
crowned with the inner calyx, as Gsertner properly, 1 now think, 
denominates it. I have profited of the light thrown by this 
learned botanist upon Quercus, Fagus, and their allies, though 
I cannot concur with him in separating Castaneu from Fagus. 
No genus, I think, can be more natural than Fagus, as esta- 
blished by Linnaeus. There is no shadow of a character to di- 
stinguish Castanea, but number in the parts of fructification, 
which, in this tribe, is of all things most uncertain ; see Introd. 
to Botany, ed.5. 383. I " condemn" nobody j but Gsertner, like 



MONOECIA— POLYANDRIA. Betula. 153 

all botanists devoted to one object, as he was to fruits and seeds, 
mostly attach too universal and exclusive importance to such 
parts, in botanical discrimination, A good judge should con- 
template the whole fructification and habit impartially, learning 
from thence the limits of a genus, and not making technical 
characters form the genus, as is now too often done ; witness 
some able french writers on Orchidece, and a thousand unlearn- 
ed ones on every side. Wiildenow cannot however pass un- 
blamed for naming corolla in Castanea, what is evidently as 
truly a calyx as in his Fagus. Could he really aim at making 
only a more plausible generic character ? — Dr, Hooker very pro- 
perly corrects him. 
The nuts, termed Beech Mast, are the food of hogs, and of va- 
rious small wild quadrupeds. By pressure they yield a sweet 
oil, fit for many purposes, but which has, 1 know not why, dis- 
appointed several speculators who aimed at making it a source 
of pecuniary advantage.

Tree. April, May. 

One of the most hardy of trees, conspicuous hi plantations for its 
white scaly cuticle, and when old, for the deep black clefts of its 
bark. The wood is hard, tough, and white. Branches long and 
slender, especially in old trees ; in /3, which is hardly a perma- 
nent variety, they droop more, and are minutely warty. Leaves 
ovate, or slightly deltoid, taper-pointed, unequally, or rather 
doubly, serrated ; a little downy underneath, though not so in 
j3 ; and assuming a golden colour in autumn. Catkins termi- 
nal, stalked, pendulous ; the fertile ones falling all to pieces 
when ripe, scattering the numerous winged seeds. 

The branches of this tree make the best brooms. The wood is use- 
ful for many purposes. Its sap contains much sugar, and fer- 
ments into a kind of rustic wine, if obtained from wounds in the 
trunk, before the leaves appear.

A rigid tree, of humble growth, patient of cropping, and well suit-

and hardness ; the tarA: smooth and whitish, or light grey. Leaves 
resembling those of an elm, but smooth, doubly serrated, point- 
ed, about 2 inches long, plaited when young, having numerous, 
parallel, transverse, hairy ribs. Stipulas oblong, obtuse, smooth, 
reddish, deciduous. Catkins and clusters terminal, solitary, 
drooping ; the latter becoming greatly enlarged, with perma- 
nent, dilated, stalked, unequally 3-lobed, sharply serrated, veiny, 
dry, pale-green bracleas, each enveloping an angular nut 
scarcely bigger than a grain of barley.

A tall, straight, hardy, long-lived tree, determinately branched ; 
the bark scaling off in thick portions ; the wood, or Red Deal, 
highly useful for building. Turpentine is the natural exudation 
of the tree, either spontaneously, or from w^ounds in the trunk. 
Tar and pitch are obtained by means of fire, or boiling. The 
leaves grow 2 together, from scaly buds disposed in a quincunx, 
and are linear, straight, smooth j channelled above ; convex be- 
neath. Catkins accompanied with many scaly bracieas. Cones 
tuberculated, tessellated, about 2 inches long, useful only for 
fuel. They might perhaps serve, like the bark, for tanning.

either from the same buds as the leaves, or more com- 
monly from different ones. Their Jlorets are almost uni- 
versally separated, being all barren on one plant, and 
fertile on another of the same species, without the slight- 
est possible difference, in the characters or appearance 
of the two individuals, in any other respect. Sometimes 
indeed a barren Jloret or two occurs in a fertile catkin^ 
especially among the monandrous species ; sometimes 
catkins have been found nearly equally fertile and barren, 
as in our n. 49, 50 and 51. In n. 52, S. oleifolia, Mr. 
Borrer has, for several years, traced the progress of this 
mutation in the organs of impregnation, which confirms 
a I'eport, whose origin does not appear, of "Willows 
changing the nature of their blossoms. This however is 
treated as a fiction by Linnaeus, in his Gen. PI. 514, 
without any assigned authority, and he proves mistaken.

If different circumstances may prevent, or promote, the 
production ofjlowers at all, see Litr. to Botany, ed, 5. 113, 
they may surely cause the above alteration ; which though 
different, is not more surprising than peaches and nec- 
tarines, varying every year in compai'ative quantities, 
along with some individual fruits, half peach, half necta- 
rine, which I have seen and tasted, from the same tree. 

The arrangement of the species of Willows is a matter of 
considerable difficulty, as well as their technical discri- 
mination. The smoothness or hairiness of their leaves, 
is in many cases variable, and when decided, or constant, 
often widely separates species naturally allied. The 
margin of those parts, whether entire, serrated, crenate, 
or toothed, cannot in all cases, afford an indisputable 
character. The stipidas are variable in many respects. 
A suggestion in Fl. Br. 1072, recommending \hegermen, 
whether sessile or stalked, the length of the style, and the 
division of the stigmas, for discriminating natural sec- 
tions of the genus, met with the approbation of some good 
botanists, and has been adopted by Wahlenberg, with 
the addition of the germen being downy or smooth ; but 
the characters thus obtained, though excellent for the 
discrimination of species, do not lead to their natural ar- 
rangement. No good plan having yet been proposed, I 
have in Rees's Cyclopcedia, and pretty nearly in the pre- 
sent work, followed that of Willdenow, which is liable to 
as few exceptions as any other. It is always advisable, 
in such undertakings, to be led by common usage, rather 
than doubtful speculation, and especially to avoid altera- 
tion, for the sake of alteration alone. 

In the far more arduous imdertaking of specific definition, 
the most able critics will be the most aware of my diffi- 
culties. Full 30 years have I laboured at this task, 10 
of them under the instructive auspices of my late friend 
Mr. Crowe, in whose garden every Willow that could be 
got was cultivated ; more especially all that could be ob- 
tained from any part of Britain, by that unrivalled col- 
lector Mr. Dickson. The plants were almost daily vi- 
sited and watched by their possessor, whom no character 
or variation escaped ; seedlings innumerable, springing 
up all over the ground, were never destroyed till their 
species were determined, and the immutability of each 
verified by our joint inspection. This was the more ma- 
terial, to set aside the gratuitous suppositions of the mix- 



DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 165 

tiire of species, or the production of new, or hybrid ones, 
of which, no more than of anj' change in established spe- 
cies, I have never met with an instance. Strange altera- 
tions in the shapes and sizes of leaves, and their stipulas, 
have indeed been seen, on young radical shoots, from a 
tree, or bush, that has been felled ; but not more than 
usually happens in Poplars, Limes, Elms, and others. 
Willows should be particularly studied at three different 
seasons ; the flowering time, the early part of summer, 
when the young shoots, with their stipulas and expand- 
ing foliage, are to be observed; and finally when the 
leaves are come to their full size. No botanist therefore 
can be competent to form an opinion about them, unless 
he resides among the wild ones, for several seasons, or 
continually observes them in a garden. No hasty tra- 
veller over a country, no collector of dried specimens, or 
compiler of descriptions, can judge of their characters, or 
essential differences. One principle above all, in this 
department of Botany, and indeed in every other, cannot 
be too strictly enforced. We should study a species 
before we decide on its characters, and not lay down 
rules of definition beforehand. In many plants, the dif- 
ferences of simple or compound, entire, serrated or jagged 
leaves, the presence or absence of stipulas, though usually 
so essential and decisive, make no specific distinction at 
all. In some tribes, or genera, one part affords the best 
specific characters, in others some different part. The 
distinctions of Willows are frequently so very nice, that 
the greatest observation and experience only can stamp 
them with due authority. Yet persons to whom their 
qualities and uses are of the last importance, mightjiold 
a botanist very cheap, who could not help them to know 
one from another. I should have hoped that my excel- 
lent friend Dr. Hooker would have given Mi\ Crowe and 
myself credit for. some accuracy of observation, and not 
have set almost all our labours at nought, without some 
practical knowledge, at least, of his own. I am well 
convinced that he meant to be right, and should be truly 
sorry that his decisions, or his style of expressing them, 
should depreciate him in the opinion of persons who do 
not know him so well as I do. Satisfied with a careful 
revision of the subject, and with correcting myself 
wherever I could find occasion, I leave to others the un- 
grateful task of criticism. The errors of some, other^ 



166 DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 

wise able, authors are so extremely preposterous, as to 
want no refutation ; nor could they be set right without 
an examination of their specimens, in order to know what 
they intended. There is reason to suspect, that even the 
acute Wahlenberg, one of the most justly esteemed bo- 
tanists, has in many instances misunderstood the species 
of Linnaeus, which indeed he had not sufficient materials 
to determine. The great difficulty, originally attending 
the Willows of Great Britain, consisted in ascertaining 
Mr. Lightfoot's species. This I accomplished by taking 
all the Salices of the Linnjeaii herbarium to Frogmore, 
where his collection was then preserved in the hands of 
her late Majesty Queen Charlotte. Thus, whatever mis- 
takes might have been committed in the Flora Scotica, 
were corrected, and the nomenclature of the whole set- 
tled on the most indisputable grounds. In perusing the 
remarks of the great Dillenius, recorded by Linnaeus, 
under almost every species of Salix, in the Flora Lappo- 
nica, any botanist may perceive the erroneous ideas of 
that eminent man with regard to their synonyms ; nor 
did Linnaeus avoid great mistakes in his subsequent la- 
bours. If such men err, others ought to be the more 
guarded in their decisions. I submit what I have done, 
to the correction of those who have paid equal attention 
to the subject, and especially to the faithful and patient 
observers of Nature and lovers of Truth. They may, in 
the study of this important tribe of plants, render great 
service to Botany and to Agriculture.

of 30 feet ; towards autumn casting the bark of its trunk, and 
larger branches, in broad solid portions, cracking angularly 
asunder, like the Plane-tree. Young branches erect, long, tough 
and pliant, smooth, leafy, brownish, somewhat brittle at their 
joint or insertion. Leaves always perfectly smooth, numerous, 
scattered, stalked, 3 or 4 inches long, and an inch broad, li- 
near-oblong, being contracted at each end only, for scarcely 
more than half an inch ; at the extremity into a taper point ; at 
the base into a somewhat unequal, rounded, but not ovate, 
shape ; their margin copiously beset with rounded, glandular 
teeth, or serratures ; the upper surface bright green ; under 
pale, or slightly glaucous,- their fine slender veins interbranch- 
ing towards the edges. Footstalks about half an inch long, 
channelled ; minutely glandular at the summit ; dilated, but ab- 
rupt, at the base, without any swelling of the branch beneath 
their insertion. Stipulas ovate, or half-ovate, oblique, crenate, 
veiny, very variable in size, often short and abrupt ; often en- 
tirely wanting. Catkins solitary, at the ends of short, lateral, 
leafy branches, which in summer are axillary. Scales obovate, 
. obtuse, of a tawny yellow, clothed externally with fine, long, 
spreading, more or less plentiful, hairs. Nectary single, with a 
blunt recurved point. Filani. 3, equal, twice the length of their 
scale. Anth. roundish, of 2 lobes. Gertn. ovate-oblong, com- 
pressed parallel to the scale, perfectly smooth, rather abrupt. 
Style very short, with 2 spreading cloven stigmas. Seeds with 
a long, dense, snow-white, woolly crown. 

The narrower-leaved Willows generally come under the denomi- 
nation of Osiers, of which this is one of the most valuable. It 
is cultivated for white basket-work, producing rods 8 or 9 feet 
long, tough and pliant, even when stripped of their bark, and 
very durable. They are cut down every year. 

Several varieties, if not distinct species, are comprehended under 
the name of S. triandra. Of these I venture to separate one as 
<S. Hofmanniana, which seems to be the triandra of German bo- 
tanists in general. Another, called French Willow, cultivated 
in Sussex, as well as in the east parts of England, has leaves 
but half the size of our triandra above described, with more 
slender footstalks, and larger stipulas. This Mr. Crowe used 
to name S. contorta, esteeming it a doubtful species, not sup- 
posed to be wild in Britain. It is from 12 to 15 feet high, with 
leaves of a fine bright green, and large yellow catkins. Stam. 3, 
or more, thrice as long as the scales. I have not seen the fer- 
tilejlowers, nor am I informed of the peculiar properties of this 
plant. 

S. triandra of Villars is now distinguished by Fliigge and Willde- 
now, n. 5, as S. Villarsiana, and is not known in Britain. 

S. Hoppeana, Willd. n. 2, is characterized by having some hatkins 
composed partly of barren, partly fertile, florets. Its leaves, 



168 DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 

though very glaucous beneath, agree nearly with S. triandra, of 
which species Mr. Sieber^ who sent me specimens from Saltz- 
burghj appears to think it a variety.

Mr. Borrer, to whom I am obliged for first calling my attention to 
this Willow, as distinct from the Linnsean S. triandra, observes 
that the present is a shrub of more humble growth, being from 
12 to 15 feet only in height. The leaves vary from 1-J-to 2^ 
inches in length, and are in no respect linear, (their sides being 
no where parallel,) but either truly ovate, or ovale-lanceolate, 
with a very taper point j the under side light green, hardly 
glaucous. In the catkins of either sort no remarkable difference 
is to be found. Mr. Borrer has met with barren plants only ; 
Mr. Holme noticed fertile ones also, but of the latter I have 
not seen more than the leaves, which are narrower, and more 
taper at the base, than the Sussex specimens, agreeing rather 
better with Ehrhart's and Curtis's ; which two last may possibly 
hereafter prove distinct from our Hoffmanniana, as they, doubt- 
less, are from the real triandra.

serving for brown hampers, crates, &c., but not for the finer 
sorts of baskets, as when peeled they are apt to split in work- 
ing. An essential specific distinction exists in the leaves, which 
are longer and narrower than those of triandra or any of its re- 
puted varieties, more pointed and tapering ; not linear, but 
truly lanceolate. Footstalks bearing at the summit a pair of 
glands, or minute leaflets ; not abrupt at the base, but decur- 
rent, each meeting with a projection of the branch, tapering 
downward, and forming a kind of buttress, which character is 
clear and invariable. The stipulas are considerably pointed. In 
the catkins little difl^erence is observable. Their scales vary from 
ovate to obovate, or almost linear, and are densely hairy or 
shaggy. Germen ovate, rather more tumid than in triandra, 
though occasionally a little constricted above the middle, al- 
ways quite smooth, both in British specimens and the original 
ones of Ehrhart's S. undulata, as well as those of two other 
German botanists, though described in the Beitrage, and by 
Willdenow from the living plant, as downy. Could the copious 
hairs of the scales lead to this error ? The style is evidently 
longer than that of triandra, and the stigmas also. There is 
nothing about our lanceolata to authorize the name undulata, 
nor indeed is any such character apparent in the German spe- 
cimens. On the other hand, these have no glands upon the 
footstalks, and their youngest leaves are slightly downy, whereas 
our's are perfectly smooth in all states. Some uncertainty 
therefore attends the synonym of Ehrhart, and in any case I 
cannot but prefer an expressive to an unsuitable name. 
I rely on the well-known accuracy of the late Mr. George Don for 
the synonym of Dr. Hooker. S. lanceolata of M. Seringue, 
Saules de la Suisse 37. i. 1, is very different from mine.

170 DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix, 

On Badley Moor, near Dereham, Norfolk, Mr. Crowe. Near 
Cambridge. Rev. J. Holme. About Lewes, Sussex. Mr. Woclgar. 
In Osier-grounds, but not common in Norfolk or Suffolk, being 
esteemed a bad Osier. 

Shrub, or small tree. April, May ; and again in August. 

This seldom, or never, becomes more than a small slender tree, 
even when left to its natural gTOwth, and may rather in general 
be termed a large bushy shrub, casting its bark in autumn. If 
cut down every year, it produces rods 6 or 8 feet long, in con- 
siderable plenty, fit for coarse basket-work, but not equal to 
S. triandra when peeled. The branches are rather spreading, 
round, smooth, yellowish, strongly furrowed, and often pur- 
plish, when young. Leaves on thick and shortish stalks, most 
truly ovate, (though a little elongated and taper-pointed,) being 
rounded at the base, where their two halves are frequently 
oblique or unequal. The figure in Engl. Hot. is correct in this 
and all other respects ; exhibiting amongst other things suf- 
ficient to convince an attentive botanist of the distinctness of 
the species, the outline of a very large leaf, from a young vigo- 
rous shoot. The leaves are of a rich shining green above j pale, 
opaque, and glaucous beneath ; with fine, copious veins ; the 
margin beset with small, blunt, often unequal teeth. Stipulas 
commonly larger than in several nearly allied species, on which 
character some botanists have much relied, but their size is 
variable. They are however broad, and strongly crenate, often 
unequally heart-shaped. Scales of both catkins obovate, yellow- 
ish, slightly hairy, seldom quite smooth. Stam. 3, sometimes 
more, equal, thrice the length of their scales. Germ, green, 
smooth ; its stalk nearly equal to the scale. Caps, large, ovate, 
compressed, each valve tipped with one of the short, cloven, 
nearly sessile, permanent stigmas. Down of the seeds shorter, 
and less abundant, than in S. triandra. 

As a British plant S. amygdalina was formerly involved in some 
uncertainty. Hudson perhaps took it up on the authority of 
the Linnaean dissertation entitled Flora Anglica, on which he 
relied for Ray's synonym cited above, and this led him to that 
of Haller, who received specimens from Dillenius. Thus far all 
is perfectly correct. What Lightfoot intended is less clear. 
His description is partly compiled from Haller, and his only 
authority for this Willow, as a native of Scotland, is Dr. Par- 
sons, in whose time nobody was well acquainted with it. Lin- 
naeus hesitated to refer it to S. triandra ; which he knew only 
from Gmelin's specimens, still remaining in his herbarium, and 
not as a Swedish plant. Neither had he examined ihe flowers 
of amygdalina, nor had Lightfoot ever seen them. Mr. Curtis 
seems to have been contemplating all these uncertainties, when 
he "strongly suspected 5. amygdalina to be no other than 
triandra." Mr. Crowe indeed first accurately compared and 



DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 171 

distinguished them, by their leaves, so that no doubt can arise 
in future. The learned inquirer will find the synonyms of .S. 
fragilis obscurely implicated in the history of these species ; yet 
nothing can be much less like them in habit, characters, or 
qualities. Haller's S . persicce folio auriculato, p. 151 of his first 
edition, is marked S. fragilis in that book, by Linnseus himself, 
though quoted in Fl. Suec. ed. 2. 346, for mmjgdalina ; and it 
appears by the description of Haller that he had the fragilis 
originally before him. In his second edition, under n. 1636, 
the description is altered, and rather accords with amygdalina. 

5. S.pentandra. Sweet Bay-leaved Willow.

Tree. June, July. 

A handsome upright tree, about 15 or 20 feet high, exhaling a 
fragrant bay-like scent from the resinous notches of its leaves, 
as well as from the barren catkins. The branches are smooth 
and shining. Leaves on stout, rather short, footstalks, with 
very small stipulas, or none at all, ovate, with a taper point j 
their length 2 or 3 inches ; breadth an inch, or inch and half j 
both sides finely veined, perfectly smooth 5 the upper of a full, 
rich, shining green ; under paler, and more opaque ; their edges 
finely and copiously crenate throughout, discharging a yellow 
resin, whence the scent originates. This resin, as Linnaeus 
observes, stains paper between which the leaves are pressed, 
with rows of permanently yellow dots. About the top of each 
footstalk, in front, are several glands, likewise resinous. Cat- 
kins solitary, at the ends of leafy shoots of the present year, as 
in other species ; the barren ones large, dense, yellow, with 
oblong, obtuse, hairy scales, half the length of their 5 or 6, 
sometimes 8 or 9, f laments, which are more or less densely

bearded at the base ; the common stalk or receptacle is also 
hairy. Fertile catkins about the same size, often 2 inches long, 
their receptacle, and base of the scales, hairy, Germens smooth, 
ovate, elongated and contracted in their upper part, much 
longer than the scales, each on a very short stalk. Style thick, 
scarcely so long as the deeply-cloven stigmas. 
For its beauty and fragrance this Willow deserves cultivation in 
gardens, but its use in other respects is inferior to many. The 
dyeing quality, mentioned in Fl. Suec, rather belongs to the 
supposed variety, first distinguished as a species in Rees's 
Cyclopcedia, by the name of ^iwc^oria, and whose branches serve 
to bind down thatch in the south of Sweden, where that plant 
grows wild,

Shrub. April. 

A large bushy shrub, scarcely attaining the height or form of a 
tree, with upright, round, stout, rather brittle branches, smooth 
except when young. Leaves 2 or 3 inches long and 1 inch 
broad, elliptic-lanceolate, acute, or somewhat pointed ; a little 
rounded, and sometimes unequal, at the base ; unequally cre- 
nate almost throughout j the upper side dark-green, turning 
black in drying, quite smooth, even at an early period, except 
the mid-rib, which is generally finely downy ; the under side 
glaucous, veiny, sometimes besprinkled with small scattered 
hairs, the mid-rib also being more or less hairy. Footstalks 
half an inch long, stout ; downy above ; greatly dilated at their 
base. Stipulas, if present, rather large, about half the length 
of the footstalks, obliquely heart-shaped, crenate, veiny, smooth. 
Catkins much earlier than the foliage, solitary at the ends of 
short lateral shoots, beset with a few small leaves. The barren 
ones an inch or inch and half long, rather thick ; their scales 
obovate, hairy, brown in their upper half, white in the lower. 
Filam. 2, nearly thrice the length of the scales, hairy at the 
base, slender, swelling upward. ^«i/i..of 2 oval lobes, yellow,

2 inches long when fully grown. Germen awl-shaped, downy, 
on a short, thick, likewise downy, stalk. Style smooth, longer 
than the stigmas, permanent like them. Caps, ovate-lanceolate, 
silky, of 2 recurved, light-brown valves. Seed obovate, polished, 
with a copious woolly crown. 
The young buds are tipped with a small tuft of deciduous down, 
as remarked by Linnaeus, who in his Fl. Lapp, justly distin- 
guished this Willow from his phylicifolia. It ought rather per- 
haps to be placed near .S'. Forsteriana, n. b7 , and its allies, the 
leaves being seldom perfectly smooth on both sides. The sup- 
posed fertile plant, indicated in the Linnsean Transactions, is, 
at best, very doubtful, and I have not adverted to it in the above 
description. S. nigricans is of no known economical use. 
Whatever Wahlenberg may intend under this name, t. 1053 of 
Fl. Dan., cannot be our plant, for which Engl. Bot. is the ori- 
ginal authority.

Shrub. Mat/. 

A low, spreading, smooth bush, whose long, recumbent, brown 
or purplish, branches take root as they extend in every direc- 
tion. Leaves on shortish stalks, not much spreading, about 2 
inches long, not 1 broad ; very acute at the point ; not at all 
rounded at the base ; smooth at all times, except an obscure 
downiness on the mid-rib above ; harsh to the touch, bitter, 
variously crenate or serrated, the serratures peculiarly, and 
sometimes very remarkably, undulated ; the upper side of a dark 
shining green ; under glaucous. Stipulas half-ovate, inclining 
to lunate, small, glandular at the inside towards the base. Ca^- 
kins from small lateral branches, accompanied by 2 or 3 small 
bracteas rather than leaves, terminal, solitary j the fertile ones, 
which alone 1 have seen, all over hoary, with fine dense silky 
hairs. Scales linear-oblong, obtuse. Nectary single, abrupt. 
Germen lanceolate, or almost awl-shaped, on a stalk about a 
third its own length, and half as long as the scale. Style smooth^, 
except at the base, about as long as the notched, spreading.

oblong stigmas, and subsequently longer. Barren catkins not 
observed. 

Wahlenberg declares that the figure in Engl. Bot. agrees suffici- 
ently well with his S. phylicifoUa, but that in this latter the 
germens are much more elongated, (which his plate expresses,) 
and by no means silky ; though the young branches are always 
downy, like the footstalks, and common stalk of each catkin. 
The last character only answers to our Scottish plant, whose 
young branches and footstalks are very smooth, while the ger- 
mens, scales and common stalk are silky. This author therefore 
must mean a distinct species from our's. The specimens of 
Lightfoot and Linnaeus precisely agree in leaves, but both are 
destitute of fructification ; so that the points in dispute, cannot 
by them be absolutely settled, except that their branches and 
footstalks are smooth. 

Fl. Dan. t. 1052 bears scarcely any resemblance to the species 
before usj and t. 10.53 is quite different from S. nigricans. S. 
Croweana is as unlike phyUcifolia. 

8. S. jBorreria?ia. Dark Upright Willow.

Shrub. May. 

A bushy shrub, 8 or 10 feet high, with copious, dark-brown or 
blackish, short branches, quite smooth in every stage of growth, 
and always erect, by no means spreading or trailing. Leaves 
perfectly lanceolate, with smaller, more even serratures than the 
last, dark- green, quite smooth at every period, and about 2 
inches long ; their under surface very glaucous, or blueish. 
Footstalks longer, and more slender, than the foregoing. Sti' 
pulas scarcely ever visible, but, if present, very small and lan- 
ceolate. Barren catkins, the only ones I have seen, copious, 
lateral, on short stalks, coming before the leaves ; their scales 
ovate, acute, brown, densely shaggy with long silvery hairs, 
quite unlike the silky down of S. phyUcifolia. Filam. 2, bright 
yellow, smooth, long and slender. Anth. oblong, of a deeper 
hue. 

Fl.Dan. t. 1052, which has no stipulas, and which the author re- 
fers, with doubt, to n. 350 of Linn. Fl.Lapp. t.8.f. c, (that is 
S. nigricans,) comes nearer to phyUcifolia ; but answers better, 
except the broad-leaved shoot in the plate, to S. Borreriana, 
whose upright, bushy branches it well expresses. The catkins 
indeed are drawn much smaller, and their scalesiax less shaggy.

Shrub. April. 

A bushy shrub, 10 or 12 feet high, with long, spreading, or ascend- 
ing, leafy branches, whose bark is dark-brown, or purplish, 
smooth, except a slight downiness on the very youngest shoots. 
Leaves 1|- inch long, and nearly half as broad, elliptical, acute, 
slightly rounded at the base ; unequally serrated, partly crenate, 
and partly undulated ; their upper surface of a deep shining 
green, partially and minutely downy, with a reddish, densely 
downy, mid-rib j under glaucous, with many transverse parallel 
veins, and quite smooth throughout, except when very young. 
Footstalks stout and rather short, dark brown ; downy above ; 
much dilated at the base. Stipulas if present half ovate, soon 
withering j often entirely wanting. Barren catkins earlier than 
the leaves, lateral, an inch long, on very short stalks, accom- 
panied by a few small, oblong, entire, externally silky,^oraZ 
leaves. Scales brown, ovate, shaggy with long white hairs ; the 
upper ones bluntish. Filam. yellow, smooth, except sometimes 
at the bottom, thrice as long as the scales. Fertile catkins not 
yet observed. 

I cannot refer this to any described species, and probably the ger. 
mens and styles, if known, might afford additional distinctions. 
It comes nearest to the two last, especially to S. phylicifolia , 
and is also allied to S. tenuifolia.

Shrub. May. 

About 6 feet high, bushy, with upright, smooth, brown branches. 
Leaves about an inch and half long, broadest above the middle, 
sharp-pointed, bordered with shallow serratures, or minute 
glandular teeth ; tapering at the base ; smooth, except a slight 
downiness on the midrib of the youngest ; their veins reticu- 
lated at right angles. Siipulas scarcely ever discernible. Foot- 
stalks slender, downy on their upper side ; slightly dilated at 
the base. Fertile catkins rather earlier than the leaves, on 
short, lateral, leafless stalks ; the main stalk of each, as wrell as 
the small, rounded, though variable, scales, the stalks of the 
germens, and the germens themselves, all more or less silky, 
not hairy, the latter in a Swiss specimen nearly smooth. They 
are always lanceolate, moderately stalked, each with a smooth 
style, full as long as the blunt, deeply divided, stigmas. Cap- 
sules lanceolate, smooth, or somewhat silky. Seeds few, with 
long, not very copious, down. The barren plant I have not 
seen. 

My late friend Mr. Davall sent a specimen of this Salix from 
Switzerland in 1790, which, when shown to Prof. Mertens, was 
pronounced by the latter to be S.phylicifolia of Willdenow and 
other German botanists. It is not however that of Linnaeus, 
nor apparently of Wahlenberg. A plant brought from Scotland, 
and seen by the same able botanist in Mr. Borrer's garden, 
received from him the same appellation. This agrees with the 
original Swiss specimen, except that the germens, and indeed 
all parts of the catkins, are much more silky ; a character which 
often proves variable. Possibly Fl. Dan. 1. 1052 may represent 
this Willow, but it is not sufficiently like, in the outline of the 
leaves, to be taken for it. At any rate, this species deserves to 
be recorded, as admitted, on all hands, to be distinct, by the 
meritorious name of its earliest discoverer. S. appendiculata 
of Villars, t. 50./. 19, is evidently very different, though cited 
by Willdenow.

Shrub. Jpril, May. 

Stem branched, at first diffu.se, 12 or 18 inches high,: afterwards 
upright, attaining the height of a man ; branches straggling, 
short, scarcely downy, except partially when young. Leaves 
an inch or inch and half long, broadly obovate at an early period, 
afterwards more elliptical, with a small point ; smooth all over, 
except at an early age, when the upper surface and its midrib, 
as well as thefootstalks above, are now and then finely downy ; 
the under side is glaucous and always smooth, like the back of 
the footstalks ; veins reticulated at right angles, as in the last j 
serratures shallow. Stipulas very minute in our specimens, and 
scarcely discernible in Wulfen's, communicated by Jacquin ; 
but they are said to appear on the oldest branches, of an ovate, 
acute shape, or clasping the branch in a semicircular form. 
Catkins accompanying the young leaves, each on a short, la- 
teral, downy, almost leafless, stalk ; the barren ones an inch 
long ; fertile when in fruit twice as large. Scales oblong, more 
or less hairy, always fringed. Stamens thrice their length, as is 
likewise the awl-shaped, mostly smooth, germen, whose densely 
hairy stalk is only about half as long as the annexed scale. 
Caps, smooth, tumid at the base, awl-shaped above. Style and 
stigmas permanent, smooth ; the latter deeply cloven, about 
half the length of the style.

Nearly related to the last, from which I will not assert it to be 
specifically distinct. Yet having long been known by the name 
of tetrapla, which originated with the late Rev. Dr. Walker, I 
think it worth noting, for future examination. This name 
alludes to the spiral insertion of the leaves, of which, according 
to the learned writer, four complete each circuit of the branch. 
The whole shrub is larger than -S'. WuJfeniana ; the leaves longer, 
more elliptical, and more pointed, with unequal, coarse and 
wavy serratures ; deep green above ; finely glaucous, with pro- 
minent, pale or reddish, veins beneath ; smooth, except a very

minute, short, dense downiness on the upper side of the mid- 
rib and of the footstalk. Sometimes even this slight pubescence 
is wanting. Catkins from several short, leafless, lateral, crowd- 
ed stalks. Scales ofte:i in pairs, bearded ; those in the lower 
part of the catkin oblong, about equal to the stalks of the ger- 
mens; the rest rounded, and much shorter. Gerinen ovate and 
tumid at the base, thrice the length of its downy stalk, tapering 
towards the extremity, where it is, now and then, a little silky, 
but otherwise quite smooth. Style smooth, as long as the deeply 
cloven stigmas. I am not certain of the barren plant of this 
species. Those who may fortunately ascertain it, will perhaps 
find characters, either to confirm those proposed above, or to set 
aside the species, for there are traces of variableness about all 
the specimens I have seen.

Shrub, or small tree. April, May. 

Branches at first erect and wand-like, round, of a mahogany co- 
lour, beset with copious, nearly upright leaves, and attaining 
the height of 6 feet. If neglected, the plant becomes a small 
tree. The youngest shoots only are downy or minutely hairy. 
Leaves 2 or 3 inches long, and an inch, more or less, in breadth, 
shorter, but not narrower, in Ehrharfs specimen than most 
English ones ; all terminating in a short, broadish point ; the 
margin unequally toothed, here and tliere slightly revolute, 
rarely a little wavy ; the base rather sloping, slightly, and not 
uniformly, rounded ; the upper side of a full, bright, shining 
green, not so much blackened by drying as in S. nigricaris or 
some others, and for the most part smooth, except the midrib, 
the very youngest only being all over downy. The under side 
is very glaucous, slightly hairy in a young state only, with nu- 
merous, prominent, interbranching veins. Footstalks downy on 
the upper side, broad and triangular at the base ; their length 
various on the same tree. Stipulas half-heartshaped, acute, 
serrated, usually small, but variable. Catkins earlier than the 
foliage, lateral, solitary, on short stalks, with a few ovate, very

silky.^oraZ leaves ; their scales oblong, obtuse, except the lower 
ones, brown at the upper part, and bearded with long hairs. 
Germen ovate-lanceolate, on a stalk half its own length, both 
together twice the length of the scale, and both densely clothed 
with snow-white, cottony down. 
This species is unfit for any economical use. The twigs are brit- 
tle, and though the leaves are large and handsome, tire bush 
itself is not ornamental. It is in some points allied to the Sal- 
low tribe.

Shrub. May, June. 

A copiously branched spreading shrub, from 1 to 2 feet high ; 3 or 
4 times as much if allowed to grow undisturbed in a garden ; 
the branches round, very smooth after the first season, but 
clothed, while young and leafy, with fine, short, dense, curved 
pubescence. Leaves broadly elliptical, the lowest somewhat 
obovate ; pointed, contracted, or acute, at each end ; the mar- 
gin partly serrated and wavy, especially about the middle j 
partly entire, or often crenate ; the upper surface bright green ; 
tinder glaucous, or whitish, with prominent rectangular veins ; 
both sides variously besprinkled with fine, minute, close hairs, 
sometimes scarcely visible. Footstalks short, densely downy 
all over, as is the midrib occasionally. Stipulas very small in 
the wild plant, often wanting, quite smooth, serrated, either 
lanceolate and straight, or half-ovate, sometimes curved. Cat- 
kins solitary, on short, lateral branches, with 2 or 3 pretty large 
Jloral leaves; the barren ones yellow, cylindrical, slender, an 
inch long, with linear, long-bearded scales; stamens 2, a little 
hairy occasionally ; fertile ones longer and thicker, at least 
when the seeds ripen. Capsules ovate, not quite sessile, as they 
seem at first sight, but each on a short, perfectly smooth stalk, 
their surface not at all downy, but somewhat wrinkled or lan- 
even. Style longer than the 2 thick notched stigmas. — The sub- 
stance of the leaves, at least while rather young, is thin and 
pliant J their length varies from 1 i to 2 inches. I cannot sepa-

rate from this the more downy variety, mentioned in Fl. Brit. 
whose sHpulas also are quite smooth ; nor can I refer either of 
them to any of the foregoing, more rigid-leaved, species. There 
\s, unquestionably, a great affinity between the present and 3 of 
the preceding ones, nitcns, Wulfeniana, and tetrapla ; of which 
not having studied living specimens, nor growing plants, I do 
not venture to say anything decisive. I must recommend them 
to the patient observation of good botanists and cultivators. 
Willdenow very justly remarks that his S. coruscans, 77. 53, Arbus-

Mr. Crowe was aUvays persuaded that he found this Willow wild 
in some part of Norfolk, from whence he took cuttings for his 
garden. It has since been gathered in Scotland, and was per- 
haps originally sent from thence by Mr. Dickson, who supplied 
Mr. Crowe with several new Scottish species. 

Shrub. April. 

The aspect of this Salix is altogether singular amongst our British 
kinds, resembling some sort of Apple-tree rather than a Willow. 
The stem is from 3 or 4 to 6 feet high, crooked, with numerous, 
irregular, spreading, crooked or wavy branches, most leafy about 
the ends ; their bark blackish 5 the young ones hairy. Leaves 
crowded, irregularly spreading, somewhat twisted, full 2 inches 
long and 1 broad, of a thin dry and crackling texture, like an 
evergreen, though perfectly deciduous 5 their shape elliptic-ob- 
long, with short or blunt points, sometimes obovate and nar- 
rower ; contracted, not rounded nor heart-shaped at the base ; 
the margin unequally wavy and copiously toothed ; both sur- 
faces quite smooth ; the upper bright green ; under glaucous, 
with prominent, parallel, pale veins, interbranching near the 
edges ; midrib reddish, always perfectly smooth. Footstalks 
smooth, short and thick, broad at the base, rarely a little hairy 
at the back. Stipulas as long as the footstalks, or a little 
longer, recurved, irregularly heart-shaped, toothed, smooth ; 
glaucous beneath. Fertile catkins, the only ones I have seen, 
earlier than the foliage, an inch long, erect, dense, honry, on 
short lateral stalks, bearing also a few lanceolate, acute, pale- 
green, crenate floral leaves. Scalex obovate, copiously bearded. 



DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 181 

half the length of the lanceolate smooth gerinen and its smooth 
shortish stalk. Style about the length of that stalk, with blunt 
undivided stigmas. 
The only matter of doubt regarding this Salix is whether it be 
more than a variety of the Lapland S. hastata. After culti- 
vating them together for many years, I have always thought 
them distinct. The hastata is more arborescent, with larger, 
more heart-shaped, leaves, and very large stipulas, often above 
an inch long, which give the leaves a hastate appearance. The 
fertile catkins are likewise larger, and more woolly ; their scaZes 
not so properly bearded, as clothed with copious dense wool. In 
the germens, styles, &c., I find no difference. Dr. Wahlenberg 
unites these two species, commending the plate in Engl. Bot. as 
a good figure of his hastata, which, as he says, varies, " beyond 
measure or belief," in the shape and dimensions of its leaves. 
Thus far I might submit to his better opportunities of studying 
the hastata, and all its possible varieties, wild, in Lapland. But 
when the same learned writer reduces to this species S. Arbus- 
cula, Linn. Lapp. n. 360. t. 8.f. m, I cannot help suspecting a 
great mistake, few plants being more distinct ; nor is S. tenui- 
folia of Afzelius, which we examined and named together, more 
than distantly allied to either. Wahlenberg's figure, t. 16./. 5, 
does not answer to any of them, and cannot be meant for any 
state of hastata or malifolia. 1 have indeed S. hastata from 
Switzerland, Haller's n. 1654, named S. Arbuscula long before 
Wahlenberg's Ft. Lapp, appeared. A similar specimen could 
hardly have misled him. It is difficult to conjecture what 
S. hastata of M. Seringe, Sanies de la Suisse, 58, can possibly 
be, so inconsistent is the assemblage of synonyms, and so dis- 
cordant is the description with our true Linnaean hastata. This 
author never saw the leaves, without which nothing can be de- 
termined ; but if once seen, they can never be mistaken. Three 
species more dissimilar than my malifolia, tenuifolia, and the 
Linnsean Arbuscula, hereafter described, n. 33, cannot possibly 
be brought together.

Shrub, or small tree. April. 

A bushy tree, with slender, spreading, flexible, smooth, purplish, 
or dark brown, branches. Leaves about 4 inches long, and 
nearly I broad, pointed, serrated, smooth on both sides ; bright 
green above ; glaucous beneath ; soon turning black as they 
dry ; their base unequal and obtuse. Footstalks long, linear, 
and slender ; downy above, like the midrib. Stipulas lanceo- 
late, serrated, smooth, somewhat curved, or lunate ; often 
wanting. The young leaves are revolute, partly silky, very thin 
and tender. Fertile catkins before the leaves, solitary, on short 
lateral bracteated stalks, as usual ; an inch long, soon becoming- 
longer, and rather lax. Scales rounded, notched ; the upper 
ones most oblong ; all hairy, or almost bristly. Stalk of the 
gerraen as long as the adjoining scale, or longer, hairy. Germen 
ovate, obtuse, clothed with silky hairs. Stig7nas nearly or quite 
sessile, thick, deeply cloven. 1 know nothing of the barren 
plant. 

After gathering, the young leaves especially exhale a strong scent, 
like the flavour of bitter almonds, but less agreeable. No use 
has been made of this Willow, though it seems to abound in the 
substance called Tannin. Mr. Pursh has suspected it not to be 
truly Britisli ; but there seems no reason why, like several 
other Willows, it may not grow wild in Europe as well as in 
North America, and the authorities above mentioned are not 
likely to be erroneous. Nobody, who has seen the living plant, 
can confound it with any other, either British or exotic. 

17. S. vitellina. Yellow Willow, or Golden Osier. 

Leaves lanceolate, acute, with cartilaginous serratures; 
smooth above ; glaucous and somewhat silky beneath. 
Stipulas minute, lanceolate, deciduous, smooth. Germen 
sessile, ovate-lanceolate, smooth. Scales linear-lanceo- 
late, acute, fringed at the base, longer than the pistil.

Tree. May. 

A handsome tree, of a moderate height, with plenty of nearly up- 
right, smooth and shining, yellow branches, still more ornamen- 
tal when they become clroo|)ing •, at all times rendering the 
plant conspicuous, and distinguishable from every other Wil- 
low. Leaves 2 or 3 inches long, lanceolate, tapering at each 
end, narrow, with numerous fine cartilaginous serratures ; the 
upper side green and smooth ; under glaucous, more or less 
besprinkled with silky hairs } both sides, in a young state, are 
silky, with a silvery gloss. Footstalks rather short and thick, 
smooth, like the branches, except when young. Stipulas rarely 
seen ; when present very small, lanceolate, serrated, their up- 
per or inner surface smooth ; and they mostly fall before the 
leaves. Catkins early, tapering, yellow, on short lateral branches, 
with a few broadish-lanceolate floral leaves, silky beneath ; the 
barren ones 2 inches, fertile 1 inch, long. Scales of both lan- 
ceolate, wrinkled, or wavy, more or less woolly. Stem. 2, 
rarely 3 ; when full-grown longer than their scale. Germ. 
shorter than its scale, nearly or quite sessile, ovate, obtuse, 
smooth. Style deeply cloven, with blunt notched stigmas. The 
nectary consists of 1 , 2, or 3 obtuse, yellow, notched scales, 
but it is liable to several variations. 

The smoothness of the full-grown leaves, at least of their upper 
side, has occasioned this species to be placed in the present 
section, and not next to the S. alba, to whicli in other charac- 
ters, as well as general habit, it is so very near, tliat Haller took 
it for a mere variety. Hoffmann observes that the liber, or 
inner layer of the bark, is yellow, while that of the alba is green ; 
but I have great doubts of the constancy of this character. 

S. vitellina is cultivated for ornament, as well as for use as an 
osier, the rods being tough and flexible, fit for many purposes 
of basket-work, as well as for package. It has been introduced 
from Europe into North America, where, according to Mr. Pursh, 
it is common by road sides, and in plantations.

Tree. May. 

An upright but not lofty tree, distinguished by the smooth, clay- 
coloured bark of the last year's branches, which shines like 
porcelain, as if varnished ; the shoots of the present year being 
stained with a fine red, or crimson. Leaven lanceolate, 3 orS^ 
inclies long, tapering at each end, serrated throughout, with 
copious, bluntish, .somewhat incurved, tooth-like serratures ; 
smooth on both sides, except the youngest, which are silky, es- 
pecially their midrib. Footstalks downy along their upper side ; 
glandular, or bearing two small leaves, at the summit. Stipulas 
half ovate, acute, toothed, for the most part small, often want- 
ing. Catkins on small leafy branches, with from 3 to 5, spread- 
ing or recurved, obovate, nearly entire, Jloral leaves ; the barren 
ones cylindrical, dense, 2 inches long ; fertile rather longer. 
Scales of both elliptic-oblong, obtuse, fringed and downy rather 
than hairy, or bearded. Stam. 2, very rarely 3, with a nectary 
of 2 opposite unequal glands at their base. Germen lanceolate, 
smooth, on a shortish smooth stalk, and tapering into a stout 
smooth style, one third its own length. Stigjnas obtuse, cloven, 
half as long as the style. 

Hoffmann first distinguished and delineated this species. Many 
botanists have confounded it with S.fragilis, to which it is re- 
ferred in the Flora Britannica ; but on seeing them together 
growing, they were readily distinguished. The present is truly 
wild in several parts of England, and is not unfrequently culti- 
vated, producing, for a few years, good rods for basket-work, 
but they gradually become shorter, and not worth cultivating. 
The tree is not inelegant, and maybe admitted into ornamental 
plantations, in low situations, along with the Golden Osier. 

19. S./ragi/is. Crack Willow. 

Leaves ovate-lanceolate, pointed, serrated throughout, very 
smooth. Footstalks glandular. Germen ovate, abrupt, 
nearly sessile, smooth. Scales oblong, about equal to the 
stamens and pistils. Stigmas cloven, longer than the 
stvle.

Tree, xipril. May. 

A tall, bushy-headed tree, whose branches are set on obliquely, 
somewhat crossing each other, not continued in a straight line, 
by which it may readily be distinguished in winter. They are 
round, very smooth, with a brown, polished bark, and so brittle 
at the base in spring, that with the slightest blow they start 
from the trunk. Such indeed is more or less the case with S. 
decipiens, and several other Willows, both native and exotic ; 
and having been observed in the preceding as well as following 
species, these have both been referred to S. fragilis, however 
distinct in characters and important qualities. Leaves 4 or 5 
inches long, taper-pointed, lanceolate, with blunt, often unequal, 
but not coarse, serratures, very smooth, except in the earliest 
.state, when they are rather silky ; the upper surface is of a dark 
shining green ; under paler ; they are broadest toward the base, 
and when full-grown become rounded at that part, approaching 
to an ovate shape, as expressed in FL Lapp. t. 8./. b, and agree- 
ing with the original Linnsean specimen, though the plant is 
called "a lofty shrub" in that work, not acquiring, perhaps, in 
Lapland the lieight usual with us. Footstalks perfectly smooth, 
as well as the midrib, more or less glandular about the top, but 
scarcely ever producing small accessory leaflets. Stipidas half- 
heartshaped, strongly toothed, various in size. Catkins on 
short branches, like the foregoing, but the floral leaves are less 
abrupt, and straighterj barren ones obtuse, 2^ inches long, 
dense, with rounded, concave, hairy scales, and from 2 to 5 sta- 
mens to eachjloret, accompanied not unfrequenlly with an im- 
perfect pistil, as well as a rounded nectary. Scales of the fer- 
tile florets rather longer. Gertnen nearly sessile, smooth, ovate, 
obtuse, rather compressed, with a nectary like that of thebarren 
florets at its base, on the contrary side to the scale. Style very 
short, witli deeply divided spreading stig7nas. Neither the sta- 
mens nor the stigmas project much beyond their respective scales . 
The common receptacle of all the catkins is woolly. 

The wood is of little value. AVhatever economical or medical uses 
have been attributed to this Willow belong to the following, 
which has very generally been mistaken for it, in many parts of 
England. I have formerly, but erroneously, suspected that 
Ehrhart's specimens, published as fragilis, might rather be our 
Russelliana. They want full-grown leaves, and barren catkins, 
but as far as can be determined, they answer to the true fragilis ;

and having been collected at Upsal, tliey ascertain this, at least, 
to be a native of Sweden, which is confirmed by the Flora Sue' 
cica, where the root, boiled for a considerable time, is said to 
serve "the country people for staining eggs of a purple colour." 
A similar practice in Scotland, at Easter, is of very ancient date.

More handsome than the lust in its mode of growth, as well as 
altogether of a lighter or brighter hue. The branches are long, 
straight and slender, not angular in their insertion like S. fra- 
gilis, and the trees, when stripped of their leaves, may always 
be distinguished by these marks. They are polished, very tough, 
flexible, round and smooth. Leaves lanceolate, firm, very 
smooth, except a little silkiness in the bud ; their base tapering, 
not rounded, nor do they at any period approach to the broad 
ovate form of the preceding ; they are strongly, and rather 
coarsely, serrated throughout ; the midrib stouter than the last. 
Footstalks smooth, channelled, glandular, either along their 
edges, or about the summit, where they occasionally bear 2 or 
more small lanceolate leriflets. Stipnlas half-ovate, toothed or 
cut, not constantly present. Fertile catkins, which are all I 
have seen, longer, more lax and tapering tlian those of S. fra- 
gilis, their common receptacle less downy. Scales oblong, ei- 
ther smooth or hairy, deciduous. Gertnen lanceolate, tapering, 
smooth, on a smooth stalk, at whose base, on the inside, is a 
large, abrupt, solitary, glandular nectary. Style equal in length 
to the deeply divided stigmas. The gennen protrudes^ beyond 
the scale, nearly half its own length. 

The foregoing distinctions will always mark this Willow as a sepa- 
rate species from the fragilis, which is the more important on 
account of the wide difference in their qualities and value. S. 
Russelliana, first brought into notice by the late Duke of Bed- 
ford, who engaged an able chemist, Mr. Biggin, to make expe- 
riments upon it, was found to contain, in its bark, more of the 
tanning principle, than any other tree of this country, except 



DIOECIA-DIANDRIA. Salix. 187 

the Oak. Hence this bark, taken for S.fragUis, has been found 
useful, as a substitute for the Cinchona, in agues ; and if it has 
occasionally disappointed some medical practitioners, they pro- 
bably chanced, in such cases, to give the real fragilis. Tanners 
have sometimes been, in like manner, deceived, and they will 
find it worth their while to obt^erve the character of the tree, in 
future, before they purchase its bark. On the other hand, when 
the tree in question was first recommended for cultivation, by 
the name of the Leicestershire, or Dishley, Willow, it was re- 
garded with scorn, as " only the Crack Willow," a sort notori- 
ously useless. This ignorance and prejudice are now removed, 
and S. Russelliana is found the most profitable for cultivation of 
any species of the genus, for the value of its timber as well as 
bark, the rapidity of its growth, and the handsome aspect of 
the tree. A famous Willow, planted by Dr. Johnson at Lich- 
field, is the IhtsseUiana; as 1 am assured by the Rev. Mr. Dicken- 
son, who has mentioned it in his edition of Shaw's Histoiy of 
Staffordshire, p. 1 13, by the name of fragilis.

by two little, lanceolate, acute leaves; their form exactly cylin-

hairy, black in their upper half. Nect. a single gland opposite 
to each scale. Filament always solitary, simple, smooth, twice 
the length of the -scale. Anther tawny/of 4 lobes, and as many

longer than its scale, which is shorter than that of the barren 
J/oret. Style scarcely any till after flowering, when it is slightly 
protruded. Stigmas ovate, thick, obtuse, permanent. Capsules 
hoary, densely downy. 
A very valuable osier for fine basket-work, but more especially 
for platting into low close fences, to keep out hares and rabbits, 
the leaves and bark being so intensely bitter, that those animals 
will not touch either. The twigs moreover are so long, tough 
and flexible, that they may be interwoven into any shape, and 
kept veiy close to the ground, as they always retain their hori- 
zontal mode of growth. Such a fence is scarcely inferior to one 
made of vvire, and is perhaps more durable, as continually pro- 
ducing young shoots, to supply the place of those that decay. 
It is important tlierefore to distinguish this useful and elegant 
Willow from the following. Ehrhart seems to have led Hoftmann 
into the great mistake of uniting them, telling him that the mo- 
nandra of Hoffmann, our Helix, was the only one in the Upsal 
garden. Fortunately I have from thence the real purpurea so 
named, in the herbarium of Linnaeus, who esteemed it much, 
and has celebrated its merits in the works above quoted. Ehr-

Tree. March, April. 

A tree of humble growth, but erect, about ten feet high, smooth 
in every part, altogether of a lighter hue than the last ; the 
branches not trailing, but upright, smooth and polished, of a 
pale yellowish, or purplish, ash-colour, tough and pliable, less 
slender and elongated than the foregoing, though useful for the 
coarser sorts of basket-work. Leaves, as well as catkins, often 
opposite and alternate on the same plant} the former lanceolate, 
pointed, much drawn out, as it were, into a linear shape towards 
the base j finely serrated, chiefly upwards ; their colour a light, 
rather glaucous, green, turning blackish in drying. Foolslallcs 
short and stout. Stipulas none, except on very vigorous shoots, 
from the roots of trees that have been felled, where they are 
sometimes of considerable size, half-heartshaped, wavy and 
obtuse. Catkins larger than those of S. purpurea, the fertile 
ones especially full twice as thick, by which invariable and ob- 
vious character the two species, when in blossom, are, as Mr. 
Crowe first observed, readily distinguishable. Scales obovate, 
hairy ; their upper half dark brown ; those of the fertile florets 
notched. Nect. a tumid gland, opposite to the scale. Stam. 
scarcely longer than the scale. A}ith. of 4 lobes, and 4 cells. 
Germ, silky, ovate, not elliptical. Style smooth, full as long 
as the linear, cloven, not ovate, stigmas. Caps, ovate, silky, 
light brown, accompanied by the permanent styles, stigmas and 
blackened scales ; the whole fertile catkin having that downy 
aspect noted by Haller, whose plant in Reynier's herbarium is 
certainly our's. On a more careful scrutiny of Mr. Curtis 's ex- 
cellent plate, the fertile catkins appear to belong to S. purpu- 
rea, which he was led to consider as the same species. The 
roselike expansions at the end of the branches, caused by the 
puncture of an insect, and permanent through the winter, ! 
have never seen but on the <S. Helix, except once on -S. aurita, 
11. 50. 

The leaves and twigs are less bitter than the former, and the greater 
size of the trunk, as well as branches, renders this species fit 
for several purposes which that is not. It also makes a better 
figure in plantations, and the roots give more solidity to the 
banks of rivers or ditches. 

The germcn and stigmas in Hoffmann's plates do not answer to our 
plant.

Tree. March, April. 

Of the size and habit of the last, but very distinct from it at first 
sight, particularly the tender summits of the young growing 
branches, which, with their piu'plish glaucous hue, and some 
degree of downiness, resemble those of a Honeysuckle. Leaves 
frequently opposite, shorter and broader than those of the pre- 
ceding, dilated upwards, and more or less obtuse at the ex- 
tremity, with a small point ; their base rounded, or abrupt, a 
little unequal ; the margin sharply and distinctly serrated almost 
throughout, but most above the middle ; both sides very smooth ; 
the under glaucous ; they turn black in drying. I could never 
discover any s^ijDjiZas. The footstalks ate rather short and stout, 
always very smooth. Catkins not more than half the size of those 
of 5. Helix, with rounded, blackish, hairy scales. Nectary much 
like that species. Stain, longer than the scale, with a four- 
lobed anther. Germ, sessile, of a short ovate, or nearly ellip- 
tical, tumid shape, densely downy, or silky. Style hardly any. 
Stigmas small, ovate, obtuse, spreading, furrowed and finally 
cloven into two rounded lobes. 

Mr. Borrer has sent what 1 presume to be a variety of this species, 
found and distinguished by Mr. Woolgar, near Lewes, in which 
the leaves on the upper part of strong shoots are remarkably 
broad towards the extremity, being almost wedge-shaped j 
germen shorter and more elliptical ; stigmas with very round 
and short lobes. Mr. Borrer suggests that what Hoffmann has 
given as the fertile plant of his S. monandra, our Helix, is surely 
this, with which the germen and short round-lobed stigmas 
exactly agree, and not at all with those of Helix. Whatever 
this plant may prove, S. Lambertiana is doubtless very distinct 
from Helix, differing materially in the form of its leaves as well 
as stigmas. The dried leaves, especially those of our supposed 
variety, give a smoky-black stain to papers between which they 
are laid, which is the case, though less remarkably, with S. 
Forbiana, and some others.

Shrub. April. 

Stem erect, bushy, with upright, slender, smooth twigs, very 
flexible and tough, of a greyish yellow, not purple, hue, highly 
esteemed, and much cuftivated, for the finer kinds of basket- 
work. Leaves all alternate, very seldom inclining to be oppo- 
site, larger than any of the three preceding, and more approach- 
ing to a truly lanceolate form, with a small point ; their serra- 
tures shallow and blunt ; upper surface of a deep grass green ; 
under somewhat glaucous ; both sides smooth, except a mealy 
kind of downiness when young. Footstalks a little silky, or 
downy, as is occasionally the midrib. Stipulas small, lanceolate, 
acute, often wanting. Fertile catkins extremely like those of 
5. Helix in every part, especially the stigmas ; but the leaves are 
so widely different, that the two species could not, by the most 
careless observer, be confounded, and the superior qualit)' of the 
twigs of S. Forbiana renders that difference worthy of particular 
attention. The original plant, sent by Mr. J. Forby to Mr. 
Crowe, was found now and then, to bear a solitary stamen at 
one of the lower scales of the fertile catkins, which fortunately 
showed this species to be truly monandrous, and distinct from 
Hoffmann's fissa, to which it had previously been referred, and 
which proves to be our rubra. S. Forbiana turns of an inky 
black in drying.

Tree. April, May. 

A small tree, with long, upright, smooth, greyish or purplish, 
more frequently tawny, branches, very tough and pliant, this 
being one of the most valuable osiers, when cut down annually. 
ieo»es alternate, on rather short, slender, and smooth footstalks, 
linear-lanceolate, acute, long and narrow, flat, very minutely 
toothed rather than serrated, of a fine grass green, and smooth, 
on both sides, being downy when young only. Stipulas linear- 
lanceolate and toothed, rarely observable. Barren catkins stout, 
obtuse, near 1^ inch long ; fertile rather more slender, and in 
the flowering state shorter. Scales of both obovate, abrupt, or 
notched, purplish-brown, very hairy. Filaments 2, combined 
from the base upward about half their length, more or less, each 
division bearing one orange-coloured anther of 2 cells. Germ. 
ovate, densely silky, with a large glandular obtuse nectary at its 
base, opposite to the scale. Stt/le short, with two ovate, thick, 
undivided stigmas. 

No diff"erence of opinion can exist concerning the present species, 
whose very long and narrow leaves agree in shape with the Com- 
mon Osier, .S. viminalis, but want its dense white pubescence. 
The stamens accord with the next species, differing from all other 
known Salices, The name ricbra seems to have been originally 
given to S. vitelUna, n.\7, a reddish variety of which was con- 
founded with this.

Shrub. Jpril, May. 

Stem bushy, usually 4 or 5 feet high, with many stout, irregularly 
spreading, smooth, leafy, brittle, brownish-yellow branches, of 
no value for any economical use hitherto discovered. Leaves 
alternate, perfectly smooth, on broadish smooth footstalks, uni- 
formly elliptical, very rarely inclining to obovate, l-i- inch long, 
more or less ; acute, and often recurved, at the extremity ; 
contracted gradually at the base ; the margin copiously though 
not conspicuously, serrated, or rather crenate ; the upper side 
of a deep shining green ; under glaucous, veiny. Stipulas, if 
present, half-heartshaped, rounded, crenate, coloured like the 
leaves. Catkins before the leaves, about an inch long, thickish 
and obtuse, or elliptic-oblong, almost sessile, with 2 very small 
Jloral leaves ; the barren ones bright yellow, and remarkably 
ornamental, when young. Scales elliptic-oblong, black in their 
upper half, hairy. Filam. much longer than the scales, white, 
capillary, partially combined, or monadelphous, sometimes at 
the bottom only, sometimes for half or three-fourths of their 
length, occasionally unequal. Anth. orange-coloured, of 2 cells. 
Germ, sessile, lanceolate, silky. Caps, ovate, tapering, downy, 
tipped with the permanent style and stigmas, the former of con- 
siderable length j the latter ovate, obtuse, long remaining un- 
divided, though finally cloven. 

When covered with barren blossoms, this Salix is among the most 
handsome, nor are the leaves destitute of beauty. It has no 
other value, except to commemorate an ardent and very accurate 
botanist, whose name is also perpetuated in the beautiful Crowea 
saligna of New South Wales.

minent hairs as in the true myrsinites. Leaves broadly ovate, 
tolerably uniform, an inch long or rather more, bluntly pointed, 
serrated thoughout, but not deeply ; quite smooth, even, of a 
full shining green, on the upper surface, without any prominent

veins ; glaucous, veiny, when very young only besprinkled with 
a few silky close hairs, beneath. Stipulas minute, unequally 
ovate, smooth, convex, notched, often wanting. Footstalks 
rather short and stout, smooth, except some occasional downi- 
ness on the upper side, which is also found on the midrib of the 
younger leaves, but by no means constantly. Catkins before 
the leaves, erect, on short, numerous, lateral branches, at- 
tended by obovate Jloral-leaves, silky at the back, above half 
as long as the catkin. Scales rounded, or obovate, brown, 
densely hairy, or rather silky. Germen sessile, ovate, longer 
than the scale, covered with long, silky, white hairs. Style at 
first short, but subsequently becoming longer than the blunt 
cloven stig7nas. Capsule small, ovate, brown, finally stripped 
of its hairs. 
Living plants of this were sent by Mr. Lightfoot to the Rev. Henry 
Bryant. The supposed variety with silky-backed leaves, men- 
tioned in the Fl. Br., is now reckoned a species; see the follow-

Shrub. April. 

Very distinct from the preceding, of a much more humble stature, 
with decumbent, or trailing, long and slender branches ; silky 
when young, though otherwise smooth. Leaves but half the 
breadth of the prunijolia or venulosa, covered at the back with 
close, delicate, almost invisible, silky hairs, and likewise very 
glaucous ; ihejloral ones ovate, obtuse, on long silky footstalks, 
and beautifully silky at the back, especially when voung ; the 
upper surface of all the leaves even and smooth, nearly as much 
as in the last. In the fertile catkins no great or permanent differ- 
ence is discernible, except that the scales are somewhat more 
acute, and oblong, or elliptical, as are those of the barren cat- 
kins also. Stamens full twice the length of the scales, perfectly 
distinct.

Shrub, ^pril, May. 

In size and general habit this species agrees with my prunifolia ; 
but the somewhat narrower leaves differ, I think, materially, 
on their upper surface, in their prominent, elegantly reticulated, 
veins, conspicuous in the dried as well as growing specimens, 
especially towards the margin. The under side is generally less 
glaucous than in the two last, and in having many close-pressed 
hairs comes nearest to vacciniifolia . Stipulas like prunifolia. 
Catkins rather more slender, with ovate scales. Capsules silky, 
smaller, more elliptical, at least while young ; but this last cha- 
racter, as well as the proportion of the style and sligmas, is 
perhaps variable. 

Mr. Edward Forster, of whose opinions, as well as observations, 
I well know the value, thinks the present plant only a variety 
of S. prunifolia. He has cultivated them, as I have done, and 
botanists who have equal experience must decide between us. 
Prof. Willdenow referred my venulosa, with doubt, to his own 
formosa; but some very complete specimens of this latter, sent 
by Mr. Sieber from Carinthia, prove distinct. Nothing can be 
more truly different from all of them in size, mode of growth, 
and characters, properly considered, than vacciniifolia.

Shrub. May, June. 

A sturdy, upright, bushy shruh, 1 to 2 feet high, with abundance 
of short, leafy, dark-purplish branches, hairy when young, not 
downy. Leaves very different from all the foregoing species, 
except S. malifoUa, in their rigid thin, crackling, veiny texture, 
without any thing glaucous or cottony about them, the fine hairs 
on the younger ones being scattered and silky. Both sides are 
of the same greyish green, and both alike veiny, with fine, pro- 
minent, reticulated veins, meeting at right angles. The shape 
is either elliptical, in some degree approaching to orbicular ; or 
in the variety /3 obovate-lanceolate ; all slightly pointed j the 
length about an inch or rather more ; the margin finely, but 
sharply and distinctly, serrated. Footstalks short, thick^ smooth. 
Stipulas unequally ovate, strongly toothed, smooth, variable in 
size. Catkins solitary, terminal, cylindrical, thick and obtuse, 
hoary with the abundant long hairs of the brown, elliptic-oblong, 
notched scales. Nect. obtuse, notched. Stam. 2, twice the length 
of their scale. Germ, stalked, awl-shaped, downy, tapering into 
a smooth short style. Stigmas thick, distant, deeply divided. 
Caps, brown, tapering, downy, especially towards the bottom. 

The leaves frequently remain, withered and bleached, through the 
winter. They are so unlike those of other small Willows, at 
least of all the preceding, in being of the same shining green on 
both sides, that the species cannot be mistaken. Their shape, 
though different in the two extremes, may clearly be traced from 
one variety to the other.

an inch or inch and half long, elliptical, with a small broadish 
point, flat, with very shallow tooth-like serratures ; the upper 
surface bright green, even ; under glaucous, finely veined. Foot- 
stalks short, and rather stout. Stipulas half-ovate, very minute, 
and often wanting. Catkins before the foliage, almost sessile, 
each accompanied by 2 or 3 oblong-lanceolate Joral-leave':,

somewhat silky at the back. They are ovate and short j erect, 
but hardly rising above the floral-leaves, very dense, with brown, 
oblong, notched scales, clothed with copious, long, silky hairs. 
Nect. an oblong, tumid, notched gland. Stam. not observed. 
Germ, on a longish smooth stalk, elevated somewhat above the 
scale, ovate, densely downy. Style scarcely any. Stigmas 
ovate, obtuse, yellow, large and thick, at an advanced period 
perhaps divided. 

The short ovate catkins, in which the present Salix differs from all 
we have hitherto described, and agrees with a few other dwarf 
species, particularly the rosmarinifoUa and Arbuscula, as soon 
as they appeared in Mr. Crowe's garden proved this to be dis- 
tinct from S.myrtilloides, for which it had previously been taken. 
No Willow is more decidedly smooth in every part but what be- 
longs to the fructification ; nor is the shape or proportion of the 
leaves liable to variation. Its name commemorates that great 
British botanist, who discovered it among his own native hills, 
and who has gathered and discriminated more species perhaps 
of this genus than any other person. His discoveries are every 
day confirmed, as well as his remarks, 

The germens of the real .S. mijrtilloides, not yet found in Britain, 
are quite smooth, in lax cylindrical catkins, and the leaves per- 
fectly entire. Willdenow has mistaken smooth for downy in my 
description of the leaves of S. Dicksonianu.

Larger and more erect than S prunifolia or venulosa, to both which 
it is nearly related in the fertile catkins. These are cylindrical, 
slender, erect, twice the length of the sWky -hacked Jioral-leaves, 
and quite unlike the short, dense, ovate catkins of the last-de-

as long as the germen, and clothed at the outside with long hairs. 
Germen sessile, ovate, densely silky. Style smooth, very short. 
Stigvias ovate, short and thick, finally notched. The branches 
are elongated, brown, very slightly hairy when young. Leaves

and copiously toothed, acute, smooth on both sides, except in 
the bud, where they are externally silky. They are very re-

siderable degree of rigidity, they cannot be pressed flat. Both 
sides are finely veiny ; the under one somewhat glaucous. Foot- 
stalks short and thick. Stipulas extremely minute, half-ovate. 
A prominent tooth remains on the older branches, where each 
footstalk stood. The leaves clearly distinguish this Willow from 
every other, though the fructification shows an affinity to the 
prunifolia and venulosn, next to which it ought perhaps to have 
been placed; butWilldenowv.'as not acquainted with the catkins.

Shrub. April. 

Stem erect, slender, about a foot high, naked below, like a little 
tree ; the branches spreading, round, light brown ; downy when 
young ; in their earliest state rather silky. Leaves on short, 
but s\er\der,foolstalks, moderately spreading, about an inch and 
half long, lanceolate, flat, narrow, acute, contracted at each end, 
very minutely and distantly toothed, so as to appear entire un- 
less carefully examined ; the principal lateral veins parallel, though 
their ultimate ramifications form right angles ; the upper surface 
smooth, of a light, but rather dull, green ; under more or less 
glaucous, partly silky with close hairs ; the youngest frequently 
silky, or silvery, all over. Stipulas none, except on young radi- 
cal shoots, when the whole shrub is cut down, on which the leaves 
become not longer, but broader, somewhat elliptical, with mi- 
nute, ovate, close stipulas. Catkins numerously ranged along 
the leafless branches, on short stalks, with a few lanceolate, 
tapering, haivy floral- leaves to each, which are as long, or longer, 
than the little upright ovate hoary catkin, whose scales are black- 
ish, or purplish, obovate, notched, densely bearded, each ac- 
companied by a small pale nectary. Germen ovate-lanceolate, 
silky, stalked. Sttjle very short, with large, broad, obtuse, 
tawny stigmas. 

The plant here described is the authentic type of S. Arbuscula, with 
which Linnseus associated, in his Species Plantarum, two other 
very distinct species, our tenuifolia, and the foliolosa, Fl. Lapp. 
ed'2. n. 356, He never saw the catkins of S. Arbuscula, which by 



DIOECIA-DIANDRIA. Salix. 199 

their short ovate figure assist materially in characterizing the 
species, agreeing most with those of S. Dicksoniana, from 
which the leaves of the present widely differ in form and silkiness. 
Nevertheless, when the plant is cut down, the strong radical 
shoots produce much broader, and partially elliptical leaves, 
approaching to the universal shape of Dicksoniana, but are still 
silky when young. Cultivation from seed, if possible, could 
alone determine whether the plants vary into each other. We 
know nothing of the barrenjlowers. The catkin in Dr. Wahlen- 
berg's 1. 1 6./. 2, is twice the length of our Arbuscula, and much 
more lax, nor do the leaves agree.

Shrub 

\^ery smooth in almost every part, about a foot high, the young 
branches spreading widely, and partly recumbent, with a yellow- 
ish bark, which in its earliest state is a little downy, with curved 
hairs. Leases three quarters of an inch long, elliptical, slightly 
dilated upwards, equally contracted at both ends, but not acute ; 
distinctly, but not deeply, serrated or toothed ; the smallest veins 
reticulated at right angles ; the upper side green and shining ; 
under, as Wahlenberg observes, livid rather than glaucous. 
Footstalks short and stout. Stipulas never seen by the eminent 
botanist last named, in any state or supposed variety, of the 
plant. Catkins, according to him, lax, on short stalks, with 1 
or 2jloral leaves ,- their common receptacle finely downy, as well 
as the stalks of the germens, which are twice the length of the 
little, ovate, likewise downy, scales. Germen long and cylindri- 
cal, more thickly downy. Stigmas almost sessile. 

I have seen only a branch or two with the leaves, communicated 
by my friend Dr. Hooker, which altogether agrees with the 
above description ; what regards the frnctijication is borrowed 
from Dr. Wahlenberg's work. 1 cannot refer this Willow to 
any described species, nor to any of the Linntean specimens.

This is reckoned the least of all shrubs, the stems though woody, 
perennial, and often branched, being only an inch or two in 
height, partly decumbent, very slender, and, like every other 
part of the plant, quite smooth. The roots are much stouter, 
woody, from 1 to 2 feet long, copiously branched, sending up 
abundance of the abovementioned little stems, and fixed in the 
earth and stones by copious fibres. Leaves on short stalks, al- 
ternate, pretty accurately orbicular, about half an inch broad, 
bright green, smooth and shining, as well as beautifully reticu- 
lated with prominent veins on both sides. Stipulas none. Cat- 
kins of but few flowers, terminal, solitary, stalked, erect, naked, 
cylindrical, with obovate, or roundish, fringed, yellowish scales. 
Stam. 2, distinct, rather longer than their scale, Nect. a double 
gland. Germ, on a shortish stalk, ovate, tapering, very smooth, 
as is, of course, the reddish capsule. Style short, subsequently 
elongated, permanent, with the small cloven stigmas. The scales 
of the fertile catkins are smooth, fewer, and more oblong, than 
in the others.

Larger than the last, with stout, woody, procumbent stems and 
branches, either mantling the Alpine rocks, or spreading on the 
ground, in large patches. Leaves 3 from each bud^ on long 
slender footstalks, without stipulas, alternate, nearly orbicular, 
or somewhat elliptical, an inch broad^ firm, coriaceous, though 
deciduous, entire, with an occasional notch at the end ; the 
upper surface wrinkled, of a deep shining green ; under very 
glaucous, or whitish, beautifully reticulated with abundance of pro- 
minent veins, now and then somewhat silky, but I have not seen 
them so in British specimens, except perhaps when very young. 
The summit of each footstalk is often bearded with silky hairs. 
Catkins solitary at the end of the same branch, above the leaves, 
each on a simple, often downy, leafless stalk, longer than the 
footstalks, exactly cylindrical, obtuse, reddish, dense, many- 
flowered, about an inch long, with obovate, partly woolly, 
scales. Stam. 2, distinct, twice /he length of the scales, with an 
awl-shaped nectary at their base. Germ, ovate, often curved, 
sessile, downy ; sometimes, if not always, with a nectary of 4 
club-shaped glands at its base. Hofi'mann represents a single 
gland only, and it is possible the 4 glands drawn in Engl.Bot. 
may be accidental. Stigmas nearly sessile, deeply divided. 
Caps, ovate, tumid, brown, downy or cottony, twice as long 
as the close-pressed, permanent scale. 

A most elegant little Willow, which, as Dr. Wahlenberg remarks, 
seems scarcely related to any other. Yet the spreading woody 
roots, dwari stems, round veiny leaves, and terminal long-stalked 
catkins, coming after the foliage, from the same bud, and unat- 
tended hyjloral-leaves, accord singularly with S. herbacea ; to 
which the plant before us, however widely and essentially distinct 
as a species, is evidently akin. S. p.olaris, Wahlenb. Lapp. 261 .

Stem 2 or 3 feet high, stout, bushy, with numerous short, round, 
spreading, brown or yellowish branches, downy in their early 
state. Leaves near 2 inches long, and half, or three quarters, of an 
inch wide, elliptic-lanceolate, acute, often broadest rather above 
the middle, somewhat rounded at the base, nearly, if not in every 
part, quite entire; the upper side of a beautiful glaucous green, 
remarkably even, perfectly smooth when full grown ; under 
densely downy, or cottony, of no less elegant and pure a white, 
with slightly prominent veins, and a reddish midrib. Stipulas 
small, convex, ovate, or rounded, as represented in Fl. Dan. but 
often wanting. Footstalks rather stout, reddish, a little downy ; 
their base dilated and keeled, meeting a similar projection of 
the branch at their insertion, as in S. lanceolata, n. 3. Buds 
elliptical, brown, downy, rather large. Catkins solitary, on 
short, lateral, downy branches, with 2 elliptical, stalked, ^oraZ- 
leaves, which are very silky at the back, and become near an 
inch long by the time the seeds are ripe ; erect, cylindrical, 
stout, dense, many-flowered. Scales ovate, blackish, densely 
hairy. Nect. a solitary oblong gland. Stamens 2, capillary, 
yellow, many times longer than the scale. Germen at first ses- 
sile, ovate, twice the length of the scale, thickly covered with 
very white down, and afterwards becoming a tawny, less downy, 
somewhat stalked, capsule. Style short in the flower, with thick 
ovate stigmas ; much elongated as the fruit ripens, the stigmas 
linear and deeply cloven. 

Haller's plate well represents this handsome species, insomuch 
that one cannot but wonder at its having been enveloped in any 
obscurity. Authentic Swiss specimens answer precisely to those 
of Linnaeus, and the plant remains unchanged by many years' 
culture. Wahlenberg unites it with S'. lapponum, which I can- 
not but think the arenaria of FL Dan. t. 197, whatever t. 1058 
of the same work may be. S. scricea of V^illars, according to his 
own specimens, is the true kqjponum, and I liave Swiss ones, 
properly so named, from M. Schleicher. It is Haller's 7i. 1643. 
This species, as yet, has not been noticed in Britain. The leaves 
are 2 or 2^ inches long, greyish, all over very silky, both sides 
alike, at every period of their growth, and never cottony ; the 
catkins large, with large Jloral-leavcs , like the proper foliage ; 
and oblong hairy .uales ,• the germens and capsules sessile, pc-

culiarly woolly. Nothing surely can be better marked as a 
specieSj either in the leaves or fructification ; though I must 
scruple to dissent in this opinion from Dr. Wahlenberg, who 
has studied the plants wild, and who cannot be supposed un- 
acquainted with S. lappomim. Dr. Swartz however did not 
know it, and even Linnseus has, on more than one occasion, 
confounded it with his arenaria, gathered by himself, at the 
.same time, in Lapland ; and likewise with our Sluartiana.

Shrub. May, June. 

A larger and stouter shrub than the last, of which it was supposed, 
by the original finder, to be the fertile plant ; but barren as well 
as fertile individuals of both species, agreeing exactly together 
in other respects, and differing alike from correlative ones of 
the other species, are now well known. In size and general 
habit, this most resembles S. glauca, but their discriminative 
marks are clearly discernible. The leaves of arenaria are rather 
smaller and shorter, more precisely ovate, with a little sharp 
point J their upper surface dark green, reticulated with sunk 
veins, and clothed with thin cottony down, more dense and soft 
upon the young ones ; the under side pure white, with close, 
dense cottony wool ; the veins prominent ; midrib reddish ; the 
youngest, as well as Jloral ones, beautifully silky beneath. Sti- 
pulas none. Footstalks broad at the base, not decurrent, though 
with some swellingof the branch below their insertion. Catkins 
on short lateral branches, with a (ev^ ^oral-leaves ; barren ones 
ovate, short and thick ; fertile longer, cylindrical. Scales of 
each ovate, more or less acute, blackish, copiously bearded. 
Nect. oblong, obtuse. Stam. twice the length of the scale. 
Germ, sessile, ovate, acute, covered with thick white wool. 



DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 205 

Style almost as long as thegermen, slender, with linear stigmas, 
nearly its own length, not quite so deeply divided, nor so taper- 
pointed, as in S. Stuartiana, with whose parts of fructification, 
and not with those of any other neighbouring species, the Willow 
before us most agrees. The capsule is ovate, permanently woolly, 
smaller than that of S. glauca. 
Wahlenberg changes the name arenaria for limosa, because he 
found this species in marshes and boggy situations all over Lap- 
land. The same learned writer gratuitously asserts that Lin- 
naeus confounded it with my S.argentea, gathered in his Gothland 
journey, in sandy ground, and thence called it arenaria. Now 
the very extraordinary error of referring the plant of Dillenius, 
figured in his edition of Ray, to that under our present consi- 
deration originated, not with Linnaeus, but with Gmelin, who 
sent him a Siberian specimen of my S. Stuartiana, marked with 
the synonym of Dillenius. Gmelin moreover, like Linnaeus, 
confounded the Stuartiana with the real arenaria, which latter 
is exhibited in his Flora Sibirica ; but Linnaeus has not in his 
Gothland Tour, adverted to Ray's Synopsis, nor to any thing 
else than his own Lapland plant, which exclusively answers to 
the definition he gives. So hazardous is conjectural criticism, 
unsupported by authorities ! Dr. Hooker very judiciously avoided 
being misled by Wahlenberg. The latter further errs in con- 
sidering Engl. Bot. 1. 1810 as a representation of this species, 
rather than of S. glauca. Justice to my deceased friend Sowerby 
obliges me to declare, that his plate is a peculiarly faithful re- 
presentation of the glauca, and its short style is decisive.

or roundish, with a short oblique point, entire, though somewhat 
wavy, from 1 J- to 2|- inches long j occasionally heart-shaped at 
the base ; sometimes more obovate, inclining to lanceolate, and 
the earlier ones much smaller ; ail of a hoary, or grey aspect, 
being covered, more or less completely, with long, soft, silky, 
shaggy hairs, especially the upper surface ; the under is more 
glaucous, beautifully reticulated with veins. Stipulas ovate, 
acute, hairy, veiny. Catkins terminal, large, and very hand- 
some, bright yellow ; the barren ones proceed from lateral buds 
in FL Dan. 1. 1057. 1 have seen fertile ones only, on Lapland 
specimens ; the Scottish ones being destitute of both. Wahlen- 
berg says, " the catkins always come from terminal huds, and 
are sessile, without hracteas, erect, straight, often as thick as 
the thumb, and as long as the middle finger j shining all over with 
a golden splendor, caused by the abundant hairs of the scales. 
Each scale is more than half the length of the germen, its shaggy 
hairs concealing the whole pistil. Germen larger than in other 
species, quite sessile, perfectly smooth, green, not yellowish, 
conical, or tapering from a broad base to a point, compressed. 
Style nearly as long as the germen, divided. Nectary of the 
barren flowers a thick, almost cylindrical, abrupt, solitary gland, 
at the inner side. The fruit bearing catkin generally attains 
the length of a span." Our Linnaean specimens, some wild, 
some cultivated, answer to this description. The 2 stamens, 
and nectary, are orange-coloured in the FL Dan. 

Dr. Wahlenberg justly observes that " this is the most beautiful 
Willow in Sweden, if not in the whole world. The splendid 
golden catkins, at the ends of the young branches, light up, as 
it were, the whole bush, and are accompanied by the young fo- 
liage, sparkling with gold and silver. It yields more honey than 
any other ScrZLr, insomuch that the catkins are sweet in the mouth, 
andare much frequented by alpine bees. From the marginal glands 
of the stipulas, and sometimes from those of the leaves, a gummy 
exudation proceeds, staining paper in which the plant is dried, 
like S.pentandra." These glands are not always discernible, 
at least in dried specimens. 

Even without fructification, this species is strikingly different from 
every other, and bears hardly the remotest affinity to S. arenaria 
or glauca. Haller's n. 1 651 has been taken for S. lanata, which 
it certainly is not. The son of that eminent botanist assured 
Mr. Davall of several different things being confounded under 
this n°., which every Swiss collection, that I have seen, con- 
firms.

Shrub. May. 

Stems mostly spreading, but if sheltered erect, 4 or 5 feet high, 
with numerous, upright, leafy branches, beautifully downy or 
silky. Leaves on short, stout, downy footstalks, scattered, an 
inch, or often less, in length, and half as much in breadth, 
truly elliptical, with a small curved point; the margin entire, 
slightly revolute ; the upper side of a dull green ; at first siiky, 
then downy, finally naked, reticulated with small veins ; under 
covered at all times with the most brilliant, silvery, satin-like, 
close, silky hairs, very soft, almost concealing the strong mid- 
rib and transverse veins. Stipulas ovate, entire, flat, silky, 
more or less stalked, variable in size. Catkins before the leaves, 
lateral, at first sessile, afterwards elevated on small bracteated 
stalks, cylindrical, thick, obtuse, an inch long. Scales narrow- 
obovate, rounded at the end, bearded, their upper half black ; 
those of the barren catkins almost linear. Stam. 2, smooth, 
about the length of the scale. Nect. a small, obtuse, oblong 
gland, like that of the fertile^ore/s, whose scale is broader than 
the barren one. Germ, on a silky stalk nearly as long as the 
scale, lanceolate, densely woolly, or silky, tumid at the base. 
Style at first short ; subsequently equal to the stigmas, which 
are cloven and blunt. Capsules becoming smoother as they 
ripen. The length of their partial stalks appears variable. 

With the present species we enter on a peculiar tribe of Salices, 
natives either of pure sand, or of heathy elevated situations. 
Hudson unites them all under his repens, along with a most 
distinct one, the rosmarinifolia, whose leaves are linear. The 
rest have elliptical foliage, mostly entire, peculiarly silky under- 
neath. They are of humble stature, more or less recumbent, and 
often matted, or entangled, in their growth. Though the species 
of this tribe may be difficult to define, like those of the whole 
genus Rosa, which my learned friend Gerard, in his Flora Gal- 
loprovincialis, reduced all into one ; yel a patient inquirer will

find the labour of discrimination as satisfactory in one case as 
the other. 
Dillenius represents the leaves of S. argentea more oblong, and 
more narrow, than usual. Yet his quotation of Bauhin, though 
erroneous, and especially the observation copied from Ray's 
second edition, 291, clearly ascertain what he intended.

A low creeping shrub, with long, straight, densely leafy, recum- 
bent, or somewhat ascending, round, downy branches; silky 
when young. Leaves elliptical, narrower and far less silky, 
than the last. Stipulas ovate, convex, revolute, silky, occa- 
sionally notched, but often entire ; sometimes small, lanceolate, 
and acute, on different twigs of the same plant. Catkins be- 
fore the leaves, lateral, sessile, with 2 or 3 small fcrac^eas ,• the 
barren ones short, ovate, dense, with obovate, bearded, brown- 
edged scales, half the length of their 2 capillar)- stamens ,- fertile 
rather larger, and subsequently more oblong, with several small, 
ovate, acute bracteas ; their scales longer, brown in the upper 
half. Nect. in both, thick, ovate, abrupt. Germ, ovate-lanceo-

nearly or quite equal to the scale in length, at least by the time 
of perfecting seed. -SYy/e short. Sfz'o-ni. thick, cloven. 

At the persuasion of Mr. E. Forster, I have thought proper to re- 
duce to one species, two plants that have long been cultivated, 
and considered by the late Mr. Crowe and myself, as verj- di- 
stinct. Tlie /3 is smaller in every part than the other more com- 
mon kind ; the branches more recumbent; and the leaves shorter.

They are, however, well-marked varieties, variable in their sti- 
pukis, and in the margins of their leaves being more or less per- 
fectly entire. They are both distinguishable from every other 
Willow, known to me, by a most nauseous scent, like that of 
some fresh-water fish, or certain aquatic herbs, or Sponges. 
This odour becomes powerfully oflensive, when fresh specimens 
have been confined for 2 or 3 days in a tin box. Neither of 
the original names being very suitable, nor either of them appli- 
cable to both varieties, I have preferred one which, though not 
admissible into an essential character, will ever readily assist in 
determining the S./ceiida from all its allies.

a few small ovate bracteas, most plentiful under the fertile ones ; 
which are rather larger than the others, and finally almost an

elongated and tapering, finally smooth, brown, tipped, for a 
while only, with thtunalteied style and stigmas; its siaZA: elon-

downy. 
The long-stalked, very downy, bluntish germen, and short style, 
contrasted with the sessile germen of S.fusca tapering into a 
longish style, clearly distinguish these two very similar species, 
which have often too heedlessly been confounded. A wrong 
fertile plant, sent for S.fusca, gave rise to an erroneous descrip- 
tion in Fl. Brit, corrected in Engl.Bot. 1960.

Stem bushy, erect, copiously branched, densely leafy, from 6 to 12 
inches high ; the branches spreading, brown ; downy, with fine 
close hairs, when young. Footstalks longer and more slender 
than in the last, though dilated at the base. Leaves an inch, 
more or less, in length, elliptic-oblong, straight and nearly flat, 
rather acute, not revolute, the margin quite entire, though beset 
with distant glandular teeth, most conspicuous in the older ones ; 
upper side dark green, nearly or quite smooth ; under glaucous, 
and, till the leaves are far advanced, silky, with close dense hairs ; 
both sides reticulated with veins. Buds large, ovate, downy, 
red and shining. The whole of the foliage becomes blackish 
when dried. Catkins generally before the leaves, numerous, 
on short bracteated stalks, ovate, short. Scales dark brown, 
obovate, hairy. iVeci. a brown, oblong, papillary gland. Stam. 
full twice as long as the scale. Germ, according to Hoffmann, 
who first gave a figure of it, sessile, ovate-lanceolate, dark pur- 
ple, either quite smooth, or here and there a little downy, taper- 
ing at the summit into a longish style, with cloven stigmas. 

Hoffmann's plant appears to be our's, except that he does not men- 
tion the glaucous backs of the leaves. S.fusca is totally unlike 
argentea, with which Willdenow compares it.

Root woody, rather long and slender. The stems compose an en- 
tangled mat, several feet in diameter, with straight, slender, round, 
leafy, tough, downy or silky branches, a foot or more in length, 
spreading close to the ground in every direction, with a few short 
upright ones occasionally. Leaves elliptic-oblong, numerous, 
scattered, on short and rather thick stalks, ascending, an inch 
long, convex but scarcely revolute, partly entire, partly toothed ; 
the point recurved, or twisted ; the upper side dark green, ob- 
scurely downy, veiny ; under concave, glaucous, rugged with 
prominent veins, and silky, especially while young. Stipulas 
acute, rare and small, sometimes mere glandular points. Buds 
rather small and pointed. Catkins ranged numerously along 
the naked branches, before the leaves appear, almost sessile, 
each with a few small, acute, silky bracteas ; barren ones ovate, 
sulphur-coloured, half an inch long ; fertile somewhat longer, 
and more cylindrical. Scales of both obovate, densely bearded, 
Nect. cylindrical. Stam. thrice the length of their scale. Germ. 
on a shortish, silky stalk, ovate, rather tapering, densely silky. 
Style short, not so long as the cloven, obtuse stigmas. I have 
not seen ripe capsules. 

This appears to be a very common Salix, often confounded with 
the totally distinct, not less common, S. repens, to which latter 
Willdenow refers Ehrhart's polymorpha. Nevertheless, I am 
now more confirmed in considering the specimens of this latter 
as answering to my prostrata. By the name it should seem that 
he jumbled various things together under his polymorpha, and 
Hoffmann may have seen some specimens oi repens, in Ehrhart's 
collection of trees and shrubs. Mr. Crowe at one time took 
S. prostrata {or repens, and observed its flowering regularly three 
weeks earlier than either variety of the fa;tida, along with which 
he cultivated it for many years. To that species it is most allied, 
nor is it easy to define their distinctive characters. The peculiar 
scent of the latter, its rounder leaves, and stouter, more ascend-

Root woody, long and creeping. Stems reclining or prostrate, 
about 2 feet in length, round, dark brown, sending off numerous 
crowded branches, mostly towards the end of each principal one, 
which are copiously leafy, downy, or partly silky, accompanied 
by short flowering shoots, intermixed or alternate with them. 
Leaves on shortish downy stalks, elliptic-lanceolate, very various 
in breadth, from 1 inch to 1|- long, slightly revolute and some- 
what pointed, either quite entire, or here and there notched j 
the upper side convex, dark green, at first minutely downy 
with close hairs, but soon becoming very smooth and polished, 
remarkable for its prominent veins, which meet towards the 
margin in strong, rectangular network, much more conspicuous 
than in any other of this tribe, and common to all the varieties, 
however different in length or breadth of leaf j the under side is 
concave, glaucous, very silky at an early period, finally nearly 
smooth, the midrib chiefly prominent. Stipulas small, ovate, 
acute, rarely present. Catkins earlier than the foliage, lateral, 
either sessile, or on short bracteated stalks, ovate-oblong, or 
shortly cylindrical. Scales small, obovate, blackish, bearded. 
Germ, on a silky stalk, which is equal in length to the scales, or 
longer; ovate-lanceolate, silky, with a small slender 5i!z//e, about 
as long as the thick, divided, reddish stigmas. Caps, finally light 
brown, nearly or quite smooth. 

The principal diagnostic of this species, in which all our Swiss, 



DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 213 

German, and Linnaeau specimenSj however various in the size 
and breadth of their foliage, agree with Mr. Forster's Hopton 
plant, is the prominence of the transverse and marginal veins, 
forming a strong network, on the naked upper surface of each 
leaf. The common S. repens alone has nearly the same cha- 
racter ; but the much greater size of the present plant, its long 
spreading branches, and a total difference of habit, surely must 
keep it distinct ; yet I have it from Germany as the repens of 
. Linnaeus, and depressa of Hoffmann. The angustifoUa of Jac- 
quin from himself, precisely what is represented in all the wood 
cuts above cited, has longer narrower leaves, and shorter catkins 
when in seed ; yet I have various Swiss specimens connecting 
this with our Norfolk plant, some of them altogether the same 
as what Linnaeus has marked incubacea, though the latter speci- 
men is not of Swedish growth. 
Whatever this Salix may be, which I must at present be content 
to add to our Flora, under Mr. Forster's sanction, as incuba- 
cea ; it has nothing to do with my fcetida, prostrata, fusca, or 
argentea.

Stem 5 or 6 feet high, with straight, wand-like, round, leafy

when very young. Leaves mostly alternate, but several of the 
lowermost pairs are opposite, all nearly upright, flat, an inch 
and quarter long, uniform ; broadest, and most evidently ser- 
rated, in their upper part, towards the point; green, minutely 
veiny, and smooth, above ; livid, or in some measure glaucous, 
as well as finely downy, or silky, beneath, with a prominent, 
reddish midrib, and slender veins ; the silkiness less evident on 
the older ones. Footstalks stout, very broad at the base, paler 
than the branches. Stipulas none. Catkins before the leaves, 
numerous, scattered, on short lateral stalks, each accompanied 
by 3 or 4 elliptic-oblong, partly silky, bracteas; erect, cylindri- 
cal, three quarters of an inch long, obtuse, dense, many-flowered. 
Scales obovate, partly blackish, bearded, about half the length

the stalk, with long silky hairs. Style short. Stigmas short

and thick, undivided j finally perhaps cloven. I have not seen 
the ripe capsules, nor the barren catkins. 
In its form of growth, shape of the leaves and catkins, as well as 
in the size and particular structure of the latter, this species 
comes nearest perhaps to S. purpurea, n. 2 1 ; but the catkins are 
shorter and stouter, having about half as mtmy Jiorets, and the 
leaves are smaller, silky when young, evincing an affinity to 
S.fitsca, and its allies ; on which account I have, in compliance 
with the opinion of my experienced friend Mr. Borrer, placed 
this very ambiguous, though very distinct, species, here. The 
nature of its pubescence undoubtedly justifies this determina- 
tion, and answers to the character, however artificial, of the 
present section ; approaching moreover to the partly naked, 
partly silky, foliage of the following.

Tree. April. 

Twenty or thirty feet high, if left to its natural growth ; in hedges 
or thickets more dwarf and bushy. It is readily to be distinguished 
from other common Willows by a rusty glittering hue, residing 
more perhaps in the fine veins, than in the pubescence sprinkled 
over them, which consists of minute, prominent, shining hairs, 
totally unlike the depressed silkiness of the tribe we have just 
been investigating. The rusty colour indeed increases after the 
specimens have been long dried, but is visible, in some degree, 
in the growing plant, especially towards autumn. The branches 
are smooth, reddish-brown, crooked ; the young ones slender, 
spreading, and, in an early state, downy. When the tree has 
been much cut, it of course sends forth strong flowering, and 
afterwards leafy, shoots, as represented in Engl. Bat. On 
the leafy branches of the year the lower leaves are nearly or quite 
entire, an inch, or inch and half, long, obovate, with a short 
oblique point, on shortish, slender footstalks iwiihoai stipulas; 
the upper ones twice as large, variously serrated, with half-

heaitshaped stipulcis, strongly serrated or toothed, various in 
size, never very large. All the leaves are of a firm texture, soft 
to the touch ; deep green and veiny, though not rugged, above; 
glaucous, more downy and soft, beneath, with numerous, pro- 
minent, pale or reddish veins, of which the transverse ones are 
parallel, though curved, their subordinate divisions straight, 
numerous, elegantly parallel, interbranching towards the mar- 
gin. Catkins before the leaves, numerous, nearly sessile, an 
inch long, thick, obtuse, downy, with very small, silky, oblong 
bracteas. Scales lanceolate, acute, dark brown, pale at the base, 
plentifully bearded and clothed with long silky hairs. Nect.^ a

A very curious specimen, gathered at Duckinfield, near Stockport, 
Cheshire, by Mr. Robert Gee, bears a monoecious catkin, the 
lower half of which consists of perfect germens, with their sttjles 
and stigmas ; the upper of a few misshapen bodies, with appa- 
rently perfect stamens at the top. This and another instance or 
two of the same kind, render the report of Willows changing 
their Jlowers, from one sort to another, though scouted by Lin- 
naeus in his Gen. PL, not altogether incredible. 

S. 'cinerea is perhaps one of the most useless of the Sallow tribe, 
which it here introduces. They are known by their obovate, or 
rounded, downy leaves, and thick, early, silky catkins, with pro- 
minent, yellow, distinct stamens, two in each floret. Hoffmann's 
acuminata is certainly this plant, and not what I have all along 
so named. See n. 60. I have a morsel with variegated leaves 
from Germany. 

60. S. aur'ita. Round-eared, or Trailing, Sallow. 

Branches trailing. Leaves somewhat serrated, convex, 
obovate, obtuse, with a small hooked point; hairy, and 
reticulated with veins, on both sides. Stipulas round- 
ish, convex, toothed. Germen silky, stalked. Stigmas 
nearly sessile.

Shrub. JprU, May. 

Stem bushy, usually 3 or 4 feet high ; in the variety /3 scarcely a 
foot. Branches spreading or trailing, either amongst other 
bushes, or on the ground, to a great extent, whence the name 
of Trailing Sallow by which it is known in Norfolk ; they are 
roundish, brown, hoary J rather angular, purplish, and downy, 
as well as leafy, when young. Leaves various in size, on short, 
stout, downy footstalks, obovate, generally an inch or two long, 
more or less contracted toward the base, though sometimes 
rounded, or nearly ovate, in that part; their termination is 
often remarkably obtuse, or abrupt, with abroad, short, recurved, 
hooked, or oblique, point ; both sides hairy and very rugged ; 
the uppermost dark green, wrinkled like a cabbage leaf; under 
side paler, rather glaucous, more hairy or downy, and strongly 
veined ; the margin in some measure revolute, coarsely serrated 
and crisped. The earliest leaves, appearing soon after the 
blossoms, are but i or f of an inch long, abrupt and entire ; 
very densely downy beneath ; similar to which, though partly 
serrated and less hoary, is the whole foliage of the variety /3. 
Stipulas half-heartshaped, or rounded, convex, strongly veined 
and toothed, as well as wrinkled ; glaucous and vaulted beneath ; 
very various in size, but never wholly absent. Catkins before 
the leaves, nearly or quite sessile, elliptic-oblong, with very 
small, lanceolate, hairy bracteas; barren ones not an inch long 
at most; fertile longer, especially as they advance in age. 
Scales oblong-lanceolate, or narrowly obovate, thin, bearded, 
whitish with a brown tip, soon withering. Nect. a tumid, 
abrupt, yellowish gland. Stam. twice the length of their scale. 
Germ, on a hairy stalk, which is hardly equal to the scale ; ovate, 
or, when fully formed, more lanceolate and tapering, all over 
downy, or silky. Style scarcely any. Stigmas ovate, thick, 
finally notched. The leaves occasionally form permanent rosace- 
ous tufts, like those of S. Helix, n. 22. 

There are some gradations between the common appearance of 
this Salix, and its ultimate very small-leaved variety ^ ; but, 
on the other hand, I scarcely think Dillenius correct in saymg 
there were " some pretty tall trees of it in hedges near Chissel- 
hurst." These must rather have been the cinerea, or the aqua- 
tica. Botanists, even the most attentive, have confounded both 
these species occasionally with the present, and have gone so 
lar as to suppose them all varieties of -S. caprea. 
1 have received, by favour of Mr. H. Potter, two specimens of |3, 



218 DIOECIA— DIANDRIA. Salix. 

analogous to that mentioned under S. ciyierea, bearing catkins 
composed of pistils in their lower half, and stamens in the upper ; 
above which, on one branch, are 2 entirely of barren _^ore<5. 
These grew on a dry declivity in a wood, likewise at Duckin- 
field. Their leaves clearly determine them to be the dwarf au- 
rita, and coming from the same place, it may be suspected that 
the former specimen, which has no leaves, is the same. This 
must remain doubtful. The branch most resembles ciwcrea, and 
the parts of fructification are too much alike in both, to assist 
in the decision between two such dried specimens. It appears 
that the following is subject to a similar deformity. 

51. S. aquatica. Water Sallow. 

Stem and branches erect. Leaves slightly serrated, obovate- 
elliptical, minutely downy, flat ; rather glaucous beneath. 
Stipulas rounded, toothed. German silky, stalked. Stig-

Shrub, or small Tree. April. 

Stem generally bushy, rarely forming a tree. Branches numerous, 
upright ; the young ones slender, hoary, or finely downy, leafy 
throughout, often angular. Leaiies on rather slender downy 
footstalks, elliptic-oblong, acute, about 2 inches in length, flat, 
not wavy, though serrated about the middle and towards the ex- 
tremity ; narrowest at the base ; the lower ones on each branch 
gradually smaller, quite entire, obovate, rounded and obtuse, the 
lowest of all not half an inch long ; all soft and pliant, of a dull 
greyish green, reticulated with minute veins ; not rugged, but 
even, and finally smooth, on the upper side ; glaucous and 
minutely downy, underneath. Stipulas rounded, vaulted, tooth- 
ed, smaller than the last. Catkins before the leaves, sessile, 
numerous, elliptic-oblong. Bracteas lanceolate, hairy, very

small. Scales obovate, dark brown in their upper half at least, 
externally hairy. Nect. oblong. Stam. twice as long as their 
scale. Germ. ovate-Ianoeolate, silky ; its stalk somewhat hairy, 
shorter than the scale. Siyle\eTy short. Stigmas thick, ovate, 
iindivicied. Caps, light brown, silky, with long tapering valves. 

A very common species, brittle, not of any particular use but as 
fire-wood, most related to the last, but distinct in mode of growth 
as well as foliage. The catkins too are twice as large, more like 
those of cinerea ; but much smaller than oleifolia or caprea, both 
totally different from this, and well distinguished from it by that 
circumstance alone. 

Mr. Dillwyn and Mr. J. Woods found, near London, on a plant of 
this species, some deformed catkins, analogous to those men- 
tioned under the two foregoing. 

52. S. oleifolia. Olive-leaved Sallow. 

Stem erect. Branches straight, spreading. Leaves obovate- 
lanceolate, flat, rather rigid, minutely toothed, acute ; 
glaucous, reticulated, and finely hairy, beneath. Stipu- 
las small, notched, rounded. Catkins oval, nearly half 
as broad as long.

Very abundant in the hedges and copses about Tittleshall and 
Litcham, also in the parish of Framingham, Norfolk, as well as 
in other parts of England. Mr. T. F. Forster found it in wet 
hedges and fields about Tonbridge. 

Tree. March. 

Truly arboreous, and, if allowed to grow, as tall as a common 
Crab-tree, though not of so stout a habit as the Salix caprea, 
the catkins excepted. The branches are round, when young 
somewhat angular, brown, more or less hoary with short down, 
very soft to the touch. They are leafy in the upper part, and 
in the lower beset with Jlower-bucls, at first small, for the follow- 
ing spring. These buds increase to a very large size before they 
open, so that this Willow, like S. caprea, may be known by its 
great buds, while stripped of its foliage. The leaves spread but 
moderately, and are from 2 to near 3 inches in length, 1 at most 
in breadth, elliptic-lanceolate, tapering at each end, somewhat 
obovate, acute, not pointed j at first sight seeming entire, or 
minutely serrated ; but they are more generally bordered with 
minute 'glandular teeth ; the upper side green, flat, even, ob- 
scurely hoary rather than downy ; under paler, slightly glaucous, 
with copious, prominent, reticulated, minutely hairy, veins. 



220 DIOECIA-DIANDRIA. Salix. 

acquiring by time a portion of the rusty hue of S. cinerea. Their 
substance is firm, rather coriaceous ; and in their earliest state 
they are densely downy. Footstalks rather short, downy. Sti- 
pulas either wanting, or small, never large ; when most conspi- 
cuous they are recurved, or vaulted, often cloven. Catkins 
remarkably large, thick, sessile, with a very few, peculiarly 
small, haii-y bracteas ; their shape an oblong oval ; their length 
an inch or more ; their diameter, including the stamens, above 
half as much. Scales obovate-oblong, half blackish, hairy. Nect. 
obtuse. Stam. much longer than the scale, with large golden 
anthers. 
Mr. Borrer has communicated, from Sussex, a truly wonderful 
monstrosity, observed by him for several successive years, in 
which several of the upper catkins, on some branches of this spe- 
cies, gradually change their nature. First the stamens of each 
Jloret are formed, more or less, combined, some entirely so, an 
apparently simple filament bearing 2 anthers. Further down 
there are catkins whose lower part consists of shapeless oblong 
smooth bodies, resembling germens, tipped with two simple 
minute horns, as if the antlters were replaced by imperfect stig- 
mas; and there are one or two rudiments of more complete, 
somewhat silky, germens, with 2 sessile undivided stigmas. Their 
precise nature cannot be ascertained, without mutilating this 
very curious specimen. The real fertile catkins I have not ex- 
amined   but it is to be presumed their pistils do not much differ 
from the rest of the Sallow tribe, all very nearly resembling each 
other in those organs. The specimen here described invalidates 
an opinion advanced in my Introduction to Botany, ed. 1. 276, 
ed. 5. 220, that " stamens and pistils never change into each 
other." The intelligent botanist will make his own observations, 
and may perhaps trace the progress of so strange a metamor- 
phosis. 

53. S. cothufolia. Quince-leaved Sallow. 

Stem erect. Branches spreading, downy. Leaves broadly 
elliptical, nearly orbicular, slightly toothed ; glaucous 
and downy, with rectangular veins, beneath. Style as 
lonff as the linear notched stiffmas.

Shrub. April. 

About 2 feet high ; sometimes, if sheltered, 6 or 8 feet, always 
upright, with straight, round, brown, downy, moderately spread- 
ing, branches. Leaves an inch, or inch and half long, and an 
inch wide, flat, broadly elliptical, frequently almost orbicular, 
with a broad short point; the base rounded, or obtuse ; the mar- 
gin beset with very shallow serratures, or more generally with 
small glandular teeth ; upper side dull green, covered with 
minute, depressed, scattered hairs ; under pale, or slightly 
glaucous, more loosely hairy, especially the rib, and transverse 
parallel veins, whose subdivisions compose a fine rectangular 
network. The substance of the leaves is firm and rigid, and 
their aspect resembles a Quince leaf, or rather perhaps Rhus 
Cotinus, except the latter being of a brigliter green, and smooth. 
They blacken in drying, though less than the following. Foot- 
stalks stout, downy. Stipulas small, rounded, or ovate, wither- 
ing. Buds hairy. Catkins much earlier than the foliage, sessile, 
erect, cylindrical, short and obtuse, scarcely one fourth the size 
of the foregoing, with 2 or 3 small shaggy bracteas. Scales 
obovate, broad and rounded, blackish, bearded with long hairs. 
Neat, small and blunt. Germ, ovate-lanceolate, silky, on a 
partly downy stalk, which is shorter than llie scale. Style thick, 
smooth, longer than is usual in the Sallow tribe, being equal to 
the linear, obtuse, notched stigmas. Caps, tapering, brown, 
nearly smooth. 

Villars supposes this may be an " intermediate variety" between 
the hastata and lanata of Linnaeus ; but it is impossible to make 
out what he intends by the latter, except that it is not the true 
one, nor could his spadicea have been ascertained but by a spe- 
cimen from himself. It is precisely our cotinifolia, which name 
I retain, as far preferable in itself, and nearly of the same date ; 
spadicea does not in any sense apply. No species can be more 
clearly distinct, 

54. S. hif'la. Hairy -branched Sallow.

heartshaped, pointed, finely crenate ; downy on both 
sides. Stipulas half-heartshaped, flat, toothed, nearly 
smooth.

parts turn black, and this soon happens in drying. Leaves 
elliptic-oblong, a little heart-shaped, or cut away, at the base, 
from 2 to 3 inches in length, and at least one in breadth, sharp- 
pointed, flat ; bordered with shallow serratures, or blunt notches ; 
the upper surface of a dull green, minutely hairy ; under pale or 
glaucous, more densely downy, particularly the rib and veins, 
which last are reticulated like the foregoing. Footstalks stout, 
densely downy, half an inch long. Stipulas largej half-heart- 
shaped, acute, wavy and partly toothed, veiny, green, almost 
entirely smooth, contrasted remarkably with the white down of 
the adjoining branch and footstalks, which constitutes a striking 
character of the species. Catkins nearly sessile, cylindrical, an 
inch or more in length, with small hairy bracteas. Scales black- 
ish, bearded with long hairs, obovate ; the lower ones often 
tapering to a point. Nect. roundish, papillary. Stam. swelling

more especially beneath, and when young. Footstalks downy 
in the manner of the branches. Stipulas ovate, very minute, 
externally hairy, often wanting. Buds small, bristly. Catkins 
rather before the leaves, sessile, ovate, thick, half an inch long; 
the fertile ones soon becoming thrice that length, and more laxj 
the bracteas of all oblong, smooth above, very silky at the back.

Shrub. Jpril, May. 

Ste)n bushy, its branches green the first summer, afterwards of a 
sooty brown, are clothed with dense, short, curved down, finally 
disappearing from the older ones. Leaves of a rich bright green , 
blackish when dried, an inch or inch and half long, broadly ellip- 
tical, acute, scarcely pointed, flat, finely crenate, or copiously and 
bluntly serrated ; paler, but not glaucous, underneath ; more or 
less downy on both sides, especially the midrib and veins, with 
minute hairs j their substance thin and pliant ; the very young 
ones silky. Footstalks downy, rather short. Stipulas small, 
half-ovate, toothed, slightly downy, erect and flat ; after a while 
recurved and vaulted. Fertile catkins somewhat stalked, short, 
ovate, coming before the leaves, subsequently elongated and 
cylindrical. Bracteas ovate, minutely crenate, more than half 
as long as the catkins; smooth above ; sparingly silky beneath. 
Scales obovate, all over blackish, bearded. Nect. cylindrical, 
abrupt, papillary. Germ, ovate-lanceolate, green, quite smooth 
and naked, its stalk smooth, nearly equal in length to the scale. 
Style stout, awl-shaped, smooth, cloven at the summit, longer 
than the thick, obtuse, likewise cloven, stigmas. Catkin of ripe 
capsules not above an inch long. 

The smooth germe« distinguishes this from every other known spe- 
cies of the Sallow tribe ; to which its pubescence, stipulas, and 
the structure, as well as proportion, of the parts of fructification, 
demonstrate its affinity. We know not of its being put to any 
use.

Shrub, or small Tree. May. 

Taller than the last species, forming a small tree, with finely downy 
branches. Leaves larger and firmer than those of S. Anderso- 
niana ; their upper surface of a darker or duller green, though 
more polished, scarcely downy, except the midrib and veins ; 
under glaucous, finely veiny, with more downiness ; their length 
2 or 3 inches ; the margin crenate, ratlier than serrated ; the 
young ones are very densely silky, in the manner of the forego- 
ing. Footstalks downy. S I ipulas rounded, recurved and vaulted, 
toothed, in some degree hairy. Fertile catkins an inch long 
when in full bloom, more than twice as much when the 
seeds are ripe, cylindrical, many-flowered, each on a shortish 
hairy stalk, with a couple of stalked, ovate, crenate bracteas, 

  moderately silky at the back, the size of the last-described. 
Scales partly blackish, hairy, obovate ; the lower ones 
acute ; each about the length of the hairy stalk of the tapering 
silky germen. Nect. papillary. Style about twice as long as 
the thick, notched, seldom divided, stigmas. It is represented 
too short in Engl. Bot. Capsules light brown, almost stripped 
of their pubescence. 

The structure of the Jlowers, and habit of the whole plant, show 
this, like S. Andersoniana, to be a true Sallow, though the degree 
of its pubescence is much less than what is usual in this section 
of the genus. Two names more dear than these, to the memory 
of their friends or to Botany, can scarcely be recorded in the 
history of science.

Tree. April, Mat/. 

A small bushy tree, six or eight feet high, the young branches very 
soft, with dense, hoary, short, velvet-like down. Leaves in like 
manner soft and downy, especially when first opening, always of a 
greyish aspect ; their shape obovate, or elliptical, with a small ob- 
lique point ; theu- length an inch and half, perhaps two or two and 
half at their full growth ; the margin either quite entire, or slightly, 
 sparingly, and unequally serrated ; the upper side light green, 
clothed with fine down which finally disappears ; under more 
downy, with a prominent rib and veins, hoary, not glaucous ; 
the tip, from its earliest formation, nearly naked, green, or 
brownish, soon looking as if blasted, or withered, assuming a 
tawny hue. This character, which struck me in the few dried 
specimens I had seen, is eminently conspicuous in the plentiful 
foliage of the living plant, which I saw for the first time, and 
instantly recognized, in the rich collection of Mr. E. Forster, at 
Hale End, in May 1825. The footstalks m-e shortish, thickly 
downy. Stipulas half-heartshaped, toothed, erect, green and 
smooth, never large, often wanting. Catkins on short hairy 
stalks, with several ovate, sessile, not large, bracteas, densely 
silky at the back ; barren ones above an inch long, cylindrical, 
not half the size of -S. caprea ; fertile somewhat larger and 
stouter, finally measuring full an inch and half. Scales of both 
obovate, downy and bearded, black in their upper half. Nect. 
oblong, abrupt, constricted in the middle. Stam. twice as long 
as the scale, with roundish, pale-yellow anthers. Germ, lanceo- 
late, silky, on a hairy stalk as 'long as the scale. Stijle very 
short. Stigm. thick, either undivided or notched, not deeply 
cloven. Caps, light reddish brown, somewhat silky or downy. 

Mr. Lightfoot's specimen leaves no doubt of his plant, and his de-

nothing can be more distinct than the real lanata ; see n. 40.

In woods and hedges, on a rather dry soil, very common. 

Tree. April. 

.\ moderate-sized tree, with spreading, round, brown, or purplish, 
branches, minutely downy when young. Leaves larger and 
broader than in any other of the genus, of a deep green above, 
with a downy rib ; white underneath, or rather glaucous, veiny, 
densely clothed with soft, white, cottony down, which gives them 
a considerable thickness; they are generally broadly ovate, ap- 
proaching to orbicular, with a sharp point; sometimes more 
elliptical ; either rounded, or slightly heart-shaped, at the base, 
varying in length from 2 to 3 inches ; the margin wavy, and 
more or less strongly serrated. Willdenow describes them as 
almost a foot long on young trees ; but I have never met with 
such. Footstalks stout, downy, approaching to an inch in 
length, though often much shorter. Stipulas very various in 
size, half-heartshaped, acute, serrated, ribbed, glaucous at the 
back, assuming a crescent shape as the branch swells. Catkins 
numerous, much earlier than the foliage, almost quite sessile ; 
the barren ones much larger than in any other British species, 
S. oleifolia excepted, being above an inch long, thick, oval, 
bright yellow, fragrant after rain, which last quality is, however, 
not peculiar to this species ; fertile ones at fir.st of the same size 
and shape, but they soon become more elongated and cylindri- 
cal. Bracteas oblong, small, conspicuous, at the first opening 
of the buds, for their beautiful silvery satin-like covering. Scales 
obovate, blackish, extremely hairy. Nect. ovate, papillary. Stam. 
longer than their scale, with oblong, full-yellow anthers. Germ. 
ovate-lanceolate, silky, on a hairy stalk, scarcely equal to the 
scale. iS7^Ze hardly any. -S^igm. oblong, thick, undivided. Caps. 
ovate, nearly smooth. The great Jlower-buds, before they open, 
are no less remarkable than in S. oleifolia. 

The name caprea seems to have originated in the reputed fondness 
of goats for the catkins, as exemplified in the wooden cut of the 
venerable Tragus, their namesake. 
Lightfoot well describes the various length and breadth of the 
leaves, as well as their downy softness. He speaks of the bark 
as serving the Highlanders for tanning, and of the wood as 
smooth, soft, white and flexible, used for handles of hatchets,

spades, &c, and for the cutting-boards of shoemakers. This 
bark has been found no bad substitute for the Cinchona in agues. 
The wood and branches make the best hurdles, being tough, 
flexible and durable. Their superior qualities first led Mr. 
Crowe to investigate the different sorts of Sallows and Willows, 
several totally worthless ones, like Salix bicolor, having been 
cut for use, by his labourers, indiscriminately with the present 
valuable species. The plentiful honey of the catkins attracts 
bees in the spring. Their yellow colour, and the brilliancy of 
their opening buds, enliven the country, before any other blos- 
soms appear.

Tree. April. 

Generally of more humble growth than the foregoing, though some- 
times becoming a lofty tree, with upright, or less spreading, 
branches, which are always minutely downy, very soft to the 
touch. Leaves of a totally different shape, commonly 3 or 4 
inches long, and 1, at least, in breadth, elliptic-lanceolate, 
tapering to an acute point, either flat, or somewhat rugged, 
with copious, though shallow and unequal, marginal notches ; 
the upper side green and smooth, except the midrib ; under 
paler, and in a young state glaucous, delicately soft and downy, 
with a prominent reddish midrib and veins. Footstalks reddish 
and downy, stout, measuring full half an inch. Stipulas half- 
ovate, or half-heartshaped, acute, toothed, ribbed ; glaucous 
at the back ; subsequently curved, so as to become kidney- 
shaped. Fertile catkins cylindrical, above an inch long, some- 
what stalked, with numerous, large, ovate-lanceolate, acute 
bracteas, clothed with somewhat silky down, but not silvery 
like those of S. caprea. Scales obovale, partly black, bearded 
with long hairs ; the lower ones acute. Nect. oblong, abrupt, 
flattish. Germ, ovate, densely hairy or silky, on a hairy stalk, 
not above half as long as the adjoining scale. Style, when full 
grown, equal in length to the thick undivided stigmas.

A variety, as Mr. Crowe like myself always thought it, found in a 
copse of his at Tuck's wood, near Norwich, has smaller, more 
rugged, leaves ; and rather smaller catkins; but this may arise 
from their different ages on my specimens. In the germen, its 
stalk, or the style and stigmas, I do not find any difference. 
These parts are not arrived at full maturity in the specimen 
delineated in Engl. Bot. 

Prof. Mertens first convinced me that the acuminata of Hoffmann 
is not this Salix, but an indubitable variety of aqtiatica. The 
name acuminata may well remain with our present plant ; whose 
qualities I believe are inferior, except possibly in the wood, to 
those of the caprea. It is certainly not caprea y of Linn. Sp. PL, 
which proves, by an original specimen from Gmelin himself, the 
sero^ma of Pallas ; see Rees's Ctjcl.n. 83. This latter is more- 
over S. Gmeliniana of Willdenow, Sp. PL v. 4. 709.

Branches straight, erect, wand-like, very long and slender, round, 
polished; downy when young, with fine silky hairs. Leaves on 
short stalks, almost upright, about a span long and half an inch 
wide, being nearly linear, acute, entire, though slightly wavy at 
the edges, and somewhat revolute ; the upper side green, smooth, 
even ; under pure white, with close, cottony, or rather silky, 
down ; the midrib reddish, with numerous, short, curved trans- 
verse veins. Stipulas linear-lanceolate, sometimes toothed at 
one side, variable in size, and often wanting. Catkins numerous, 
lateral, sessile, cylindrical, full an inch long, with several small, 
lanceolate bracteas. Scales small, ovate, or rounded, brown, 
bearded and clothed with white hairs, which do not reach to the 
summit of the germen. Nect. ovate-oblong, flattened, obtuse.

the length of the germen. Stigmas above half the length of the 
style, linear, acute, spreading slightly, undivided in our plant, 
as Ehrhart, like Hoffmann, describes them, though in his own 
published dried specimen they are cloven to the base. 

The value of the Common Osier, for various kinds of basket-work, 
is universally known. There is a variety much esteemed, called 
the Velvet Osier, in which no external difference is discernible, 
but the twigs are said to be more pliant. There are also various 
species, as well as varieties, comprehended under the name of 
Osiers, some of which, having smooth leaves, are described in 
the earlier y>art of our first section. Others, generally of much 
less use, will presently follow ; or if not British, are described, 
by the writer of this, in Rees's Cyclopcedia. 

Osiers differ from Sallows in their long, straight, flexible, and 
mostly tough, twigs ; their generally sessile germens, and elon- 
gated styles and stigmas. 

Haller refers to our viminalis, the S.fragilis of Caspar Bauhin's 
Prodr. 159, the description of which, as to its qualities, is 
equally unsuitable with the name. S. folio longissimo arigustis- 
simo, utrinque albido, Bauli. Pin. 474, cited by Ehrhart, as well 
as by Linnaeus, appears to be correct. 

62. S. Smithiana. Silky-leaved Osier. 

Leaves lanceolate, pointed, slightly wavy, minutely toothed; 
soft and scarce visibly downy above ; whitish and silky 
beneath. Stipulas crescent-shaped, minute. Catkins 
ovate. Germen stalked. Style shorter than the linear, 
deeply divided, stigmas.

for basket-work. Leaves on shortish downy footstalks, lanceolate, 
3 or 4 inches long, tapering to a point j the margin wavy, or 
slightly crenate, with minute teeth here and there, especially 
towards the point; the upper side green, delicately soft to the 
touch with extremely minute, almost invisible, close, silky down ; 
under pale, whitish, densely silky, and likewise peculiarly soft ; 
the midrib and slender veins reddish, rather less downy. Stipulas 
very small, at first lanceolate, a little toothed, hairy; subse- 
quently crescent-shaped. Catkins before the leaves, numerous.

nearly sessile, small, elliptical. Bracteas few, linear-lanceolate, 
acute, covered at the back with long silky hairs. Scales obovate, 
dark brown upwards, reaching to the middle of the silky, ovate- 
lanceolate, stalked germen, and clothed with long dense hairs, 
not reaching to its top. AVc<. ovate-oblong, bluntish. Style at 
first but half the length of the linear, deeply cloven, stlgimts ; 
but becoming afterwards about as long. Caps, silky, tapering, 
on a hairy stalk, and tipped with the permanent style and stig- 
mas. 
This was given to Mr. Crowe for the true Velvet Osier, and its 
remarkable softness suggested tlie name of Salix mollissma ; 
which we afterwards discovered, as we thought, to have been 
given to the same species by Ehrhart. But his molUssima I 
have lately ascertained to be totally distinct, in catkins as well 
as leaves ; which Wilidenow first perceiving, was pleased to give 
our English plant the appellation here adopted. His holosericea 
is, 1 believe, the Velvet Osier. Both that and the molUssima 
are German, not British, natives. It is important for cultiva- 
tors of Osiers to distinguish them carefully, for the Velvet Osier 
is, for some kinds of work, greatly esteemed ; whereas S. Smith- 
iana, notwithstanding the account received by Mr. Crowe, see 
Fl. Brit. 1070, proves of no utility. 

63. S. stipularis, Auiicled Osier. 

Leaves lanceolate, pointed, slightly wavy, obscurely cre-

well as the linear, undivided stigmas.

Easily known, at first sight, by its coarse tall habit, and conspi- 
cuous stipulas, but not worthy of cultivation for any economical 
purpose. Yet it was sent several times to the late Mr. Sowerby 
to draw, as the true S. viminaUs, whose valuable qualities every- 
body knows. I humbly conceive that the botanical distinctions 
of the three last, which have not been carelessly constructed, will 
be found sufficient to identify them.

most glandular ; both sides of a greyish, somewhat glaucous, 
green, beautifully silky, with close-pressed silvery hairs, very 
dense and brilliant on the uppermost, or youngest, leaves ; the 
lowermost on each branch, like the bracteas, are smaller, more 
obtuse, and greener. Stipidas variable, either roundish or ob- 
long, small, often wanting. Calkins on short stalks, with three 
or four spreading leafy bracleas, for the most part coming before 
the leaves, but a few more often a])])ear after Midsummer; they 
are all cylindrical, rather slender, obtuse, near an inch and half 
long. Scaies fringed, rounded at the end ; those of the barren 
calkins narrow towards the base ; of the fertile dilated and con- 
volute in that part. Nect. of two obtuse glands, one before, the 
other behind the slaviens. Filaments hairy in their lower part. 
Anlh. roundish, yellow. Germ, very nearly sessile, green,

/3 is a very remarkable variety, so much more valuable for cultiva- 
tion, that my late most accurate friend Mr. Crowe was ever 
anxious to find some specific character to distinguish it. We 
could at last only discover that the under side of the leaves loses, 
at an early period, most of its silky hairs. On this slight founda- 
tion, I presumed to publish it as a species by the name of cccru- 
lea, as much aware as the most critical botanist could be, that 
such a character was not satisfactory, especially as it might ori- 
ginate in the quick growth of the leaves, and the consequently 
rapid extension of their surface. Having brought this variety 
into botanical notice, I wish some careful observer, pursuing 
Nature, not empty fame, may be more fortunate ; and if the plant 
can be increased by seed, it may possibly be still further im- 
proved. Its qualities are of the highest importance. The su- 
perior value of the wood and bark, the rapid growth, as well as 
handsome aspect, of the tree, its silvery-blue colour, its easy 
propagation and culture, in dry as well as wet situations, all 
render it so superior to our Common White Willow, that a cul- 
tivator might justly think lightly of any one, who should tell him 
there was no difference between them. Indeed one of the few 
botanists really acquainted with Willows, Mr. Borrer, has sug- 
gested that there are some presumptive distinctions even be- 
tween our S. alba and that of Hoffmann, in the shape of the 
lower leaves, and of the scales of the calkins, as well as in the 
length and density of the latter. So S. vitellina, strangely re- 
ferred to alba by the great Haller, differs obviously in its longer, 
more taper, catkins; lanceolate pointed scales; smooth stamens, 
and perhaps other marks ; besides its smooth adult leaves, which 
occasion it to be placed in the first section. All these things 
deserve inquiry. The British Willows may now, perhaps, be 
found tolerably intelligible ; and the foreign ones are syste-

maticallv detailed by Willdenow, as well as in Rees's Cyclopaedia ; 
so that, notwithstanding some ambiguities, a careful observer 
may become acquainted with them all. The American species 
are worth notice. Those of Switzerland appear to be few, and 
not well understood. The German botanists greatly cxcell most 
others in a practical acquaintance with the whole genus.

Perennial. March, April. 

Root fleshy, much divided at the crown, sending up many branched, 
leafy, round, rigid, furrowed stems, 2feethigh, not flowering till 
the second year, after which they die down to the root. Whole 
herb dark green, smooth in every part. Leaves a continuation of 
the branches, equally firm and durable, with scarcely any foot- 
stalkx, alternate, spreading every way, obliquely twisted, ovate, 
not an inch long, many-ribbed, each tipped with a sharp point. 
Fl. solitary, near the middle of the upper side of each leaf, ap- 
parently sessile, but their bracteated stalk is imbedded under the 
cuticle, and runs down to the base of the leaf. Cal. pale green. 
Nect. purplish. Berry the size of a Red Currant, scarlet, juicy 
and sweetish. Seeds originally 6, but only 1 or 2 come to per- 
fection. These are hard, white, semitransparent. Instead of 
a leaflet, of considerable size, accompanying ihe flower, in some 
species, there is in this a small spine, or bristle, winged at the 
base, besides 2 or 3 membranous hracleas, on the elongated 
fruit-stalk. 

The variety j3 has more extended and wavy branches, the leaves 
rather elliptical than ovate, tapering at the base. It can scarcely 
be considered as more than a variety, being itself liable to several 
different appearances.

white, pellucid, the size of a Currant, sweet, very glutinous in-

Loranthus curopceus seems to be the original, or most common 
Misseltoe, i^o;, of the Greeks, which grows usually on some 
kind of Fir-tree. But our Viscum album is likewise found in 
Greece, though rarely, growing on the Oak ; and this has been 
preferred from the most remote antiquity. Hence, when the 
superstitions of the East travelled westward, our Druids adopted 
a notion of the Misseltoe of the Oak being more holy, or effica- 
cious, in conjurations or medicine, than what any other tree 
afforded, the Loranthus, or ordinary Misseltoe, not being known 
here. This superstition actually remains, and a plant of Viscum 
gathered from an oak, is preferred by those who rely on virtues, 
which perhaps never existed in any Misseltoe whatever. •

green on the upper side, minutely dotted, not scaly ; beautifully 
silvery, as well as scaly, beneath. Fl. green, minute, solitary 

. in the bosoms of some of the lowermost leaves while very young. 
Berries somewhat stalked, rather elliptical, orange-coloured, 
simply, but powerfully, acid, pleasant enough when preserved 
with sugar. They are seldom, if ever, ripened in gardens, 
though the shrub is very commonly cultivated for the beauty 
and singularity of its foliage. Gardeners should attend to 
the flowers being dioecious, and plant both sorts together. 

These berries afford a kind of sauce to the poor in Sweden and the 
South of France. Haller speaks of them as ill-flavoured. Rous- 

. seau gives an account of the singular politeness of a young 
Frenchman, the companion of his walks, who seeing him gather 
and eat this fruit, did not presume to warn him of its being re- 
puted poisonous.

Ca^A-ins numerous, sessile, formed during summer in the bosoms 
of the leaves, and remaining through the winter. In the follow- 
ing March they are full-grown, expanding in May. Scales of 
a red shining brown ; the lower ones of the fertile catkins hairy 
towards the tip. Berries very small, covered with resinous 
dots, exhaling a delightful fragrance when rubbed between the 
fingers. The leaves are fragrant from the same cause. Some- 
times barren and fertile catkins are produced by the same indi- 
vidual, as was first remarked by the late Mr. Templeton. 

This plant, perhaps one of the more innocent substitutes for Hops, 
is used for brewing by the poor in Sweden. Linnaeus says the 
berries boiled in water yield wax, like those of M. cerifera, or 
Candle-berry Myrtle. If so, they should seem to secrete an 
essential aromatic oil besides.

I have sometimes suspected Hops not to be indigenous, which 
was also the opinion of Lightfoot, with regard to Scothind. 
But Haller says they are never cultivated in Switzerland, where 
nevertheless the wild plant is abundant, and it may with equal 
probability be reckoned a native of Britain. The young sprouts 
boiled have the flavour of Asparagus, and are more early.

Frequent in Norfolk, as on Wells heath, and other places near 
Holkham. Mr. Crowe. Also about Seething. 

Tree, March. 

Root creeping full as extensively as the last. Tree tall and hand- 
some, with more upright and compact branches; the bark smooth, 
of a- beautiful grey silvery hue. Leaves rounder, more conspi- 
cuously 3-ribbed, less deeply or acutely lobed ; downy beneath, 
but chiefly greyish, not so white or cottony ; sometimes smooth. 
Catkhis all cylindrical, pendulous, about 2 inches long ; distin- 
guished essentially from the foregoing, as Mr. Crowe first dis- 
covered, by the stigmas, which are 8, spreading in two opposite 
directions. The scales of the fertile catkins are also more deeply 
and regularly cut. Mr. Crowe was very instrumental in bring- 
ing this tree into notice in Norfolk. He observed it to be of 
slower growth than P. alba, with which many British, as well as 
foreign, botanists have, from time to time, confounded it. The 
wood, though, till lately, but litle used or distinguished, is much 
firmer than that of any other British Poplar, making as good 
floors as the best Norway Fir in appearance, and having more- 
over this valuable property, that it will not, like any resinous 
wood, readily take fire.

Tree. March, April. 

A lofty round-headed tree, with creeping roots, the suckers from 
which, as well as the young branches, are clothed with brown, 
prominent hairs ; being sometimes hoary, but not cottony. 
Leaves roundish with a little point, smooth on both sides, 3- 
ribbed like the last, bluntly toothed, somewhat wavy, often 
shorter than their footstalks, which, being vertically compressed, 
counteract the ordinary undulating motion of the leaves in the 
wind, and cause them to quiver with the slightest breeze ; whence

the name ; and the proverbial " trembling of an Aspen leaf." 
Stipulas awl-shaped, hairy like the very youngest leaves, which 
alone they accompany. Barren catkins lax, near 3 inches long, 
with deep-cut hairy scales. Stain. 8, occasionally perhaps more. 
Fertile ones rather shorter, their scales palmate and acutely 
notched, brown, hairy. Germ, roundish, sheathed by the corolla. 
Stigmas 4, erect, awl-shaped, triangular, bright crimson ; the 
outer edge more or less wavy, extending at the base into two 
small, oblong, reflexed, wavy auricles, each common to two of 
^ the stigmas, and, when fresh, of the same rich colour. 
The wood is white, soft, light, and of a fine grain ; the bark, ac- 
cording to Linngeus, the favourite food of Eeavers. He thought 
he detected in it the flavour of the drug called Castor.

Tree. March. 

A tall umbrageous tree, without suckers. Wood tough, and close- 
grained. Bark thick, blackish, somewhat spongy. Branches 
smooth 5 rarely hairy when young. Leaves twice the length of 
their footstalks, deltoid, or unequally quadrangular, deep green, 
very smooth, pointed, serrated ; the base more entire, as in the 
other species j the under side palest. Catkins all long, loose 
and pendulous, measuring 3 or 4 inches. Scales of both kinds 
palmate, hairy, occasionally smooth. Stam. 8, scarcely more 
with us, though Linnaeus and Leers describe 16. Germ, ovate, 
but slender, closely sheathed at the base only with the regular 
cup-like corolla. Stigin. 4, awl-shaped, simple, moderately 
spreading, reddish. 

The stigmas prove J. Miller's plate to be so far correct, though re- 
ferred in Fl. Br. to P. canescens, to which possibly the leaves may 
belong. 

Several species or varieties, more or less agreeing with our's, but 
not yet noticed wild in England, have been sent from Bremen 
by the accurate Prof. Mertens. They merit examination in their 
parts of fructification, which by the foregoing descriptions appear

herbaceous, simple, leafy, about a span high. Leaves numerous, 
scattered, somewhat imbricated, obovate, pointed, bluntly tootli-

red. Cyme of many yellow _^0M;ers, with blueish anthers. 

A plant of Rliodiola, brought from Lapland by Rudbeck, lived for 
many years in the Upsal garden, without perfecting any seed; 
till an individual with more complete anthers was planted near 
it, after which seeds were regularly ripened every year. Hence 
it is proved to be naturally dioecious, though possibly both organs 
may sometimes become efficient in the same flower, as happens 
in various other instances.

Dr. Alston asserted the contrary. 

-Annual. July— September. 

Root much branched ; simple at the crown. Herb from 6 to 12 
inches high, erect, bushy, smooth, of a bright shining green, 
disposed to turn blueish after drying, like the foregoing. 
Branches numerous, crossing each other. Leaves ovate-lan- 
ceolate, less copiously serrated. Fl. green ; the barren ones 
in small tufts, ranged in interrupted spikes ; fertile ones fewer, 
stalked, axillary, destitute of nectaries. The qualities of this 
are like the last, though supposed rather less virulent. 

Dr. Alston reported that the fertile plant sometimes bore ripe 
seed, though at a distance from the barren or staminiferous 
one. In fact, a few flowers with stamens have, by several per- 
sons, been found now and then intermixed with the othen>, 
which will account for the above phsenomenon.

All the old botanists reckoned this a distinct species ; but Linnaeus 
and Haller, with their followers, have made it a variety. AVillde- 
now has restored it to its former rank, but his specific character 
is rather feeble. Indeed the whole genus requires the same in- 
vestigation that Mr. Lambert has bestowed u])on Piniis, in order 
to determine how far this, and the beautiful trailing Sabine, a.s 
well as the great Swedish Juniper, require to be considered as 
distinct species, and on what their characters are to be founded.

The wood, being of extremely slow growth, is hard and tough, 
formerly highly valuable for making bows, but now chiefly used 
for fine cabinet work, or inlaying. It makes handsomer chairs 
than many expensive exotic woods. The leaves are fetid, and 
very poisonous, and prove speedily fatal to cattle, accidentally

curved downwards, and spreading almost equally every way. 
This was brought from Ireland.

Annual. June — August. 

Root fibrous, certainly annual in all the varieties, more slender 
than in yi. laciniata. Stem most commonly erect, with long, 
spreading branches ; the herbage of a dull green, slightly mealy; 
but in j3 and y the whole plant is procumbent, more glaucous, 
often reddish, and somewhat fleshy. Leaves alternate, on long 
stalks, most powdery at the back ; the lower ones halberd- 
.shaped, having two large, acute, spreading lobes at the base, 
with many very unequal, sharp, scattered teeth, between them 
and the point; the base quite entire; upper ones gradually 
narrower, with smaller lobes or none at all, so that the floral 
ones are perfectly lanceolate, as well as entire. Spikes termi- 
nal and axillary, long, erect, interrupted, the ^o?(;ers in little 
round dense tufts. The bivalve calyx of the fertile ones is armed 
at both sides with several prominent acute tubercles, or prickles. 
In these alone seed is produced, which is finely dotted, twice as 
large as that of the following species. 

Linngeus misled our Jiritish botanists by referring Morison's sy- 
nonym of this plant to his A. hastata; whereas his own herba- 
rium and definitions prove it to be his patula ; the real hastata, 
not known in Britain, differing widely, in the large, reticulated, 
sinuated valves of the fruit-bearing calyx, whose long teeth ter- 
minate in bristly points. 

Our /3 is declared by Doody, in Raii Sijn. eel. 2. 341, to be annual, 
not perennial, and therefore, perhaps, is hardly to be known 
at all from the common sort. I have never met with any thing 
answerable to this, y often occurs on sandy ground by the sea. 
It is prostrate, more glaucous and fleshy, with a frequent tinge 
of red, and smaller, less toothed, or quite entire, leaves, differing 
from its natural inland habit, as many other plants, in maritime 
situations, often do.

This has the general habit, and dull, greyish-green, hue of the 
preceding, of which Haller was disposed to think it a variety, 
and to which Linnaeus referred some of its indubitable synonyms. 
Dr. Hooker is of the same opinion as Haller, and perhaps Lin- 
naeus, though the latter has left no specimen to decide the ques- 
tion. Ray kept them separate, though even his opinion was 
disputed. ' Most British botanists have concurred with this great 
practical observer, and there are some circumstances which 
seem favourable to their opinion. The branches spread more 
widely than even in J. patula; the leaves are uniformly lanceo- 
late and entire, never toothed ; a very few of the lowermost 
indeed have occasionally an ascending lobe at each side, but 
their base is tapering, not straight or horizontal, like the true 
halberd-shaped leaves of the last, nor are they sinuated or 
toothed. The valves of the seed-bearing cahjx are hastate, with 
an elongated acute point ; their margins entire, their disk either 
quite smooth, or besprinkled with only a few warts. Ripe seed 
but half the size of A. patula, and very slightly, if at all, dotted ; 
circumstances which prove of material importance in the nearly 
allied genus Chenopodium, but which I believe have been no where 
noticed in Atriplex, except in the Fl. Britannica. Haller re- 
marks that Ihe staminiferous^ou-Trs of the present plant are for 
the most part four-cleft.

Annual. August. 

Stem quite erect, firm, with many upright leafy branches ; panicled 
and clustered at the top. Leaves alternate, stalked, ovate-lan- 
ceolate, acute, slightly powdery or scaly ; the uppermost gra- 
dually narrower, linear-lanceolate and entire ; lower ones toothed 
orsinuated, running down at the base into a bordered footstalk. 
Clusters terminal, erect, compound, many-flowered ; leafless in 
the upper part, Fl. in short, dense, rather oblong, heads, or 
blunt spikes. Valves of the seed-bearing calyx only one third 
the size of the last, deltoid, acute, tumid ; toothed at the edges ; 
the disk of both valves beset with numerous, prominent, strong, 
acute warts, or teeth. Seed orbicular, blackish, like the pre- 
ceding, but smaller.

this plant, and confirms the characters founded on the same parts 
in the two foregoing species.

contain ; the under side, like the young branches, mealy, or 
hoary. Spikes erect, obtuse, interrupted, beset with small 
leaves in the lower part. Fl. numerous, in little dense heads ; 
those furnished with stamens having scarcely any rudiments of 
a germeii. Valves of the seed-bearing calyx ovate, acute, deeply 
sinuated at the margin ; the disk covered with large, prominent, 
sharp tubercles. Seed rather pointed, compressed. 
What gives a spiral appearance to the seed of this and other species 
of Atriplex, as described in FL Br. or Engl. Bot., is the con-

are themselves flat and straight.

Stem erect, or reclining, from three to twelve inches high, com-

alternate, obovate, obtuse, entire, leathery or fleshy, tapering 
down into short footstalks. The jlowers with stamens have no 
traces of a. pistil; the fertile ones, intermixed with them, and 
at first likewise sessile, are subsequently elevated on simple 
stalks, half an inch, or near an inch^ long, becoming enlarged, 
wedge-shaped, compressed, with two blunt spreading lobes, and 
enclosing a flat orbicular seed. In this state the plant is easily 
recognized. 

The small variety, )3, more dwarfish and depressed, is less uncom- 
mon on our eastern coast than the more flourishing and luxuriant 
state of the plant.

Herb floating, smooth, with numerous, long, filamentous 
roots. Stems several, about a span long, simple, or 
slightly branched, leafy, bluntly quadrangular. Leaves 
opposite, stalked, ovate, acute, undivided, entire, 
scarcely an inch in length, bright green, somewhat 
succulent ; the mid-rib often red or purplish. Bracteas

particular quality attributed to this plant. 
Dr. Swartz found a plant in Jamaica, agreeing, as he 
says, exactly with this, except in having four small, 
fugacious, yellow petals, which induced him to refer it 
to Ludwigia ,• though he remarked that the seeds were 
attached to the central column, not to the wings of the 
receptacle, as they ought to be in that genus. It may 
be doubted whether Prof. Willdenow has done right in 
considering these as one and the same species.

The following remarks on Anthericum serotinum 
have been communicated by Mr. W. Wilson, of 
"Warrington, a vei-y accurate observer. 

" The root consists of a bulbous part, adhering laterally 
to an articulated fibrous substance, the remains perhaps 
of the bulbs of preceding years, one articulation being 
produced annually. Herb smooth to the touch, but, 
with the exception of the lower part of the stem, evi- 
dently covered with minute whitish tubercles, resem- 
bling short close-pressed hairs. Radical leaves always 
two in the flowering specimens, of a deep shining green, 
flaccid, so as to be frequently bent downwards, semi- 
cylindrical, keeled, with one rib on each side of the 
leaf. Flower erect, veined externally, sometimes with 
purple, more frequently with green, which after the 
impregnation changes to a purple. Petals bearing a 
notched, yellow, nectariferous gland, a little way above

What Mr. Wilson has sent me from near Bangor, 
named R. arifolhis with a max'k of doubt, is cer- 
tainly not so, nor can I find more than a slight 
difference in size, none in character, between 
this Welsh plant and the common R. Acefosa, 
gathered in Berkshire and elsewhere.

Since the above account was published, I have re- 
ceived from the Rev. Charles Burton, LL.B. of 
Manchester, and from Mr. W. Wilson of War- 
rington, various specimens of Alisma repens, 
gathered about the margins of several lakes in 
Anglesea. Of these the smaller ones agree ex- 
actly with the figure in Cavanilles ; but the larger 
having stems from one to two feet long, and, 
though prostrate, less disposed to throw out 
radicles., approach so neai-ly to A. ranunculoides, 
which frequently bears reclining stalks, if not leafy 
ones, that I concur with both my obliging corre- 
spondents in thinking the A. rc})ens no more than 
a variety, differing from ranunculoides as Ranun- 
culus reptajis does from R. Flamnmla; see v. 3. 45.

Very nearly allied to A. verna, to which, as a dwarf alpine 
variety, 1 had referred the specimens sent by the late 
Mr. J. Mackay, in 1796. Dr. Greville however, who, 
with a pupil of Dr. Hooker's, of whose name 1 am not 
informed, gathered the same on Craig Challeoch in 
June 1824, at once recognized it, as Wahlenberg's 
Alsine rubella. The petals are said to be reddish, of 
which no traces remain in my dried ones. The plant 
forms dense tufts, each with a long central root. Stems 
very numerous, ascending, two or three inches high, 
leafy, downy at the summit, each bearing a solitary 
Jlower, which is the chief difterence I can find between 
this and the verna, the structure of their flowers being 
the same. Tlie leaves of rubella are perhaps rather 
shorter and blunter. I have never seen a Uving spe-

For a wild specimen of this 1 am also obliged to Mr. Robert-

this species and H.villosum, from which, as well as from 
H. alpinum, it is certainly distinct ; though perhaps the 
latter is equally entitled to be reckoned caulescent. 
The radical leaves of H. Halleri are much fewer than in 
alpinum, less coarsely toothed, and one resembling 
them is sometimes placed about an inch up the stem ; 
one or two still higher being very small, lanceolate, 
acute, and nearly sessile. Stem usually simple and 
single-floweredj rarely 2- or 3-flowered, not shaggy, 
but rough with short, black, prominent bristles. Cal. 
dark, clothed with some pale hairs, but by no means 
shaggy like ijT. aZpi?zwm. T\i&Jlorets however are ex- 
ternally hairy, about the summit of the tube, as in that

not lemon -coloured like villosum ; nor is the stem hollow

of H. alpinum.

In Swiss specimens I find no difference. The essential 
distinctions exist in the fiowers, and these are suffi- 
ciently well represented by Haller, Seguier, and Vail- 
lant, though Haller considers the two plants as varieties 
only,/g-. 4 and 5 of his/«ci^ora being our apfera. The 
calyx-leaves are shorter in proportion to the lip than 
those of the apifera, always paler, and rather white 
than pink, except when the fiowers approach to decay; 
the keel green, as in that species. Pet. rather smaller, 
shorter, and broader, more coloured ; downy on the 
inner surface. Lip essentially and obviously different,

the calyx; its margin thin, expanded, and directed

and flat, pointing forward,, more or less heartshaped 
and notched, not awlshaped and reflexed. The disk 
moreover is of a duller brown, the lines and spots less 
yellow, or vivid. There are variations as to the lip 
being more oblong, or more or less deeply lobed, but 
the terminal segment is constant ; nor can there be 
any doubt of the present species being perfectly distinct. 
I have often gathered and examined it in the grass-plats 
about Rome, but never till now met with British speci- 
mens. Mr. G. E. Smith's discovery is the more satis- 
factory, as he clearly determined its specific difterences, 
without suspecting it to be a described plant. This 
cannot, as he well remarks, be a mule of the apifera 
and our aranifera, there being a distance of two mouths 
between their periods of flowering. The latter should 
now be named Early Spider Orchis. 
The 0, arachnites is observed to grow more in tufts, or 
clumps, than the apifera, which is commonly scattered, 
or solitary, though less so than 0. muscifera.

CRYPTOGAMIA FILICES. 

* Dorsiferce. 

The Dorsal Ferns, a perfectly natural and most ele^nt 
family, compose the first section of this Order. The 
early writers, as well as Linnaeus and Jussieu, have com- 
prehended under the denomination of Filices, various 
plants which are not dorsifera, but which have some points 
of agreement with those that are so. They constitute 
however a separate section. 

Filices dorsifercv, Dorsal Ferns, composing our first sec- 
tion, consist individually of a fro7id, or leaf heaxmg the 
fructification, on its under side, orback, either in some 
part of the disk, or close to the margin, or to the com- 
mon, or to the partial, midrib. Of the barren flcmers, 
or stamens, nothing satisfactory has yet been ascertained. 
The fertile ones in their origin are so minute and ob- 
scure that nothing of their structure is known. They 
first become visible in the form of seed-vessels, containing 
very numerous and very minute seeds, proved to be such 
by their germinating like those of other plants. I see no 
advantage in applying a new denomination to the seeds 
of these and other cryptogamic plants. Hedwig gave 
the Greek name spora to the seeds of Mosses, because he 
conceived them to differ in their structure and germina- 
tion, in some indefinite manner, from seeds in general. 
The most malicious rival of his immortal fame could not 
have imagined any thing more subversive of that fame, 
or of his luminous discoveries. He proved, beyond a 
doubt, what others had only supposed, the impregnation 
of the seeds of Mosses, by means of genuine barren 
flowers and their pollen. This fact is now as well con- 
firmed and established as the impregnation of any other 
plants ; of the Hollyhock for instance, of which a young 
Swiss, in my time, thought he had obtained good seeds 
without the aid of stamens. If therefore Hedwig esta- 
blished the production of perfect vegetative seeds in the 
usual way, in the natural order of Musci, he on the other 
hand overturned his own discovery, by allowing these 
seeds to be termed sporee. For a long time indeed, in all 
his writings, he called them semina ; nor is it worth in- 
quiring how he came to alter that established term, which 



278   

Willdenow and Brown still retain. This is not merely 
a dispute of words. If the bodies in question are not 
really seeds, the offspring of impregnation, they are gem- 
moE, buds or offsets. In the former instance, they pro- 
pagate the plant, with its appropriate indestructible cha- 
racters and qualities ; in the latter they only increase or 
extend an individual, with whatever characters or pro- 
perties any variety from which they are taken may pos- 
sess. Their impi'egnation however is proved, and their 
germination well understood. The branching jointed 
fibres, which they in the first instance send forth, have 
been taken for cotyledons, but prove to be radicles, ex- 
actly the same as the whole vegetable body in Mosses, 
or any portion of it, is so very prone to produce. Even 
a fragment of the receptacle of the anthers has been found 
to throw out such fibres, which led to a mistaken idea 
of their originating in the anthers themselves. I am sur- 
prised that the impregnation of Musci should, after Hed- 
wig's correct demonstration of all the parts concerned, 
and their separate functions, still be contradicted, though 
it cannot be disproved. I humbly conceive it would be 
as idle to institute experiments to prove the generation 
of Mosses, as of Hollyhocks, or any other plants. But 
let those who doubt the fact make such experiments ; at 
least before they hazard unfounded suppositions. 

The production of perfect germinating seeds, contained in 
capsules, and consequently produced by impregnated 
fertile Jlo'wers, is as clear in Ferns as in Mosses, though 
nothing is certainly known of their stigmas, any more 
than of their anthers. We are nevertheless content to 
plead ignorance on the subject, and to presume, by ana- 
logy, that such parts may exist, rather than to assume 
the idea of some other mode of impregnation, hitherto 
unknown, which would be going contrary to the first 
principles of philosophy ; or, what is worse, returning to 
the old gratuitous fancies of spontaneous generation. 

The genera of Dorsal Ferns have been founded on dif- 
ferent characters by different writers. Ray, Tournefort, 
Plumier, and other early systematic botanists, resorted, 
in the first instance, to the shape of the frond, than 
which nothing is more vague, unnatural, or uncertain as 
a generic distinction. Linnaeus and his followers have 
trusted to the shape of the masses of capsides, whether 
round, oblong, linear, or indeterminate, whence far bet- 
ter characters are obtained, but not such as prove suffi- 



279 

cient. The writer of this, furnished with a vast collec- 
tion of Ferns in the Linnaean herbarium, and from that 
of Sir Joseph Banks, first suggested an additional prin- 
ciple of arrangement, derived from the form and inser- 
tion of the membranous cover, or involucrum, and espe- 
cially from the direction in which that part bursts, or 
separates from the frond, when arrived at maturity ; 
whether, if lateral, at the side towards the margin of the 
frond, or of its segments, or towards the rib or vein ; or, 
if tei'minal, towards the extremity, or contrariwise. This 
principle is found to produce very certain distinctions, 
and to establish the most natural genera. All subsequent 
writers on Ferns have adopted it. First, Dr. Swartz, in 
his Syjiopsis Filicum, considers the part in question as of 
eminent importance in defining the genera, and has es- 
tablished several new ones on characters taken there- 
from ; bestowing liberal commendation, in the 5th page 
of his preface, on his friend the inventor of this method. 
Willdenow in his Species Plantarum, vol. v., follows it 
without a word of acknowledgement, as does Dr. Kurt 
Sprengel in a rather superficial work, scarcely worthy of 
its able author, translated into English by Mr. Konig, 
under the title of An Introduction to the Study of Crypto- 
gamous Plants, 1807; the figures of which are quoted in 
the following pages, and will be found very useful in the 
illustration of other vegetables of this class. But what- 
ever deficiency of candour or knowledge may exist in 
other writers, Mr. Brown, in establishing the curious 
genus Woodsia, has done ample justice to his friend's 
claims, which no one was more competent to appreciate. 
See Trans, of Linn. Soc. w. 11. 170. 
The roots of Dorsiferous Ferns are perennial, either tube- 
rous or creeping, scaly, often parasitical, with crooked 
siont radicles. P/a?i^5 mostly herbaceous, natives of shady 
or damp situations, in almost all climates, either ever- 
green or deciduous ; those of tropical countries some- 
times arborescent, and occasionally spinous ; the pubes- 
cence of all, in general, scaly rather than hairy. ivoMc? with 
a simple or alternately branching stalk ; the leaf either 
firm or more rarely membx'anous, ribbed, veiny, palest 
in some degree at the back ; either simple or variously 
pinnate ; undivided, pinnatifid, or lobed ; the divisions 
mostly alternate ; entire or serrated ; bearing i\\Qfructi- 
€cation at the back, very seldom at the edges, as above

described. The membranous cover, or involucrum, which 
protects the masses of ca])sules till they arrive at maturity, 
originates either from the surface of the frond^ when it 
is termed superficial ; or terminates a rib, vein, or seg- 
ment; or is laterally inserted, by one of its margins, 
into a vein or rib, the opposite margin being closely 
pressed, if not in any degree attached, to the cuticle of 
the leaf- 
It is remarkable that insects scarcely ever feed on dried 
specimens of Ferns.

Root creeping horizontally, with numerous, stout, branched fibres, 
somewhat woody, twisted, densely clothed with membranous, 
brown, linear, serrated, taper-pointed, shining scales. Frond from 
eight to twelve or fourteen inches high, linear-lanceolate, deeply 
pinnatifid, often nearly to the main rib, with numerous, parallel, 
slightly distant, linear-oblong, obtuse, flat segments j seldom 
perfectly entire throughout ; often wavy, or serrated, especially 
about the ends ; in y forked, or partly three-cleft, with acute 
spreading lobes J in 5 doubly pinnatifid, as well as variously tooth- 
ed and serrated, the segments either obtuse, or taper-pointed, the 
whole frond elegantly imitating an ostrich feather, whence 
doubtless originated the name of Polypodium plumosum, for 
which Ray could not account. In Wales this variety has always 
been found without fructification ; but I have two Irish speci- 
mens, partly almost covered with masses of capsules, like the 
common kind. These masses are alike in all the varieties, each 
originating in a naked, depressed, scarcely visible spot, destitute 
of any cover, graduallybecoming an orbicular convex inass, or as- 
semblage, a line in diameter, consisting of fifty or sixty globular, 
shining, tawny capsules, which when ripe and dry, burst on 
the application of moisture to their jointed rings, and scatter in 
abundance their exquisitely minute seeds. Tournefort, though 
usually very accurate, denies the existence of a ring in his genus 
Polypodium, which Adanson copies. The masses, at an advanced 
period, become crowded and confluent. The common stalk of 
the frond is, in all the varieties, naked and smooth.

Fronds scattered, erect, twelve or eighteen inches high, delicate 
in texture, of a pale green, minutely hairy. Stalk brittle, pale, 
slender, sometimes a little scaly, longer than the leafy part of 
the frond, whose outline is triangular, tapering to a long slender 
point. Leaflets opposite ; two lower most deflexed ; about ten or 
twelve pair of them pinnatifid, broad and united at the base j the 
rest about as many, undivided and entire, composing the pin- 
natifid, taper-pointed, summit of \he frond. Segments all blunt, 
wavy, somewhat crenate, or entire, finely hairy, often fringed ; 
the midrib most hairy ; the hairs in various parts often aggre- 
gate, or starry ; some of them flat, like narrow membranous 
scales. Masses of capsules naked, very small, of a pale yellowish 
brown, disposed in short imperfect rows, towards the margins

Fronds about a span high, tufted, linear-lanceolate, firm, rigid 
and harsh, deep green, whether evergreen, that is biennial, or

with large, broad, taper-pointed scales ; with smaller ones 
above. Leaflets numerous^ short, crowded, stalked, alternate, 
about three-quarters of an inch long, acute, simple ; smooth 
above j rather scaly at the back, broad at the base, with a lobe 
at the upper edge, while the corresponding part of the lower is 
.sloped or cut away, the whole leaflet assuming a crescent shape j 
the margin beset with unequal bristly serratures. Masses of 
capsules in simple rows, between the midrib and margin of 
each leaf of the upper half of the frond, crowded, light brown. 
Cover orbicular, with a notch at one side, strongly fixed in the 
centre, separating all round, and finally almost obliterated by 
the elevation of the abundant capsules. 

Some small mountain varieties of A. aculeatum are often mistaken 
for this, and'hence it has been supposed a dwarf state of that 
common species. The true Lonchitis, however, is very distinct 
in appearance and characters, much less inclined to be lobed, 
and never separately auricled : its masses are thrice the size of 
the aculeatum. It is not easy of culture, and rather dwindles 
away, instead of growing more luxuriant, in a garden.

Root creeping extensively, by means of long, slender, blackish, 
thread-shaped, smooth or downy runners. Fronds rather scat- 
tered, quite erect, deep green, delicate and smooth, rarely a little 
hairy, as in Engl. Bot., each about fifteen or eighteen inches 
high ; their stalks slender, naked, or only slightly scaly. Leaflets 
elongated horizontally, taper-pointed, vei-y deeply pinnatifid ; 
their segments when barren obtuse, and obscurely crenate j 
when fertile narrower, more acute, and revolutej the lower 
part usually longest. Midrib sometimes densely hairy. Cap- 
sules minute, in small round masses, each at first covered by a 
thin, white, lacerated cover, fixed by the centre, but soon ele- 
vated and obliterated, the masses running together into simple, 
sometimes aggregate, lines, and nearly covering the lobes, so 
that Linnaeus was induced, by some such advanced specimens, 
to refer this Fern to his genus Acrostichum, into which indeed 
he originally admitted several discordant plants.

This species, which has formerly been confounded with the pre- 
ceding as well as with the following, agrees with the latter in 
size and general aspect, being usually thrice as large as A. The- 
lypteris ; though the variety /3, is scarcely equal to the ordi- 
nary height of even that plant. The root is not creeping, but 
tufted, large and scaly, formed of many strong, stout, entangled 
fibres. Fronds several, ranged in a circle, erect, lanceolate, 
leafy nearly to the bottom, their stalks being very short and 
scaly ; the leafy part mostly naked and smooth, channelled along 
the upper side. Leaflets in general opposite, sessile, but not 
crossing each other at the bottom, numerous, pointed, deeply 
and numerously pinnatifid, smooth except the midrib, which 
is for the most part finely downy, not scaly, as seems to be ex- 
pressed in Engl. Botany ; the segments flat, obtuse, entire, 
very rarely crenateat the extremity ; the under side besprinkled 
with shining, yellowish, resinous globules, exhaling, more or 
less constantly, a fragrant scent, whence perhaps Mr. Hudson 
might take this fern for Polypodium fragrans of Linnaeus. These 
globules are represented in Hedwig's figure, quoted above, as 
if they were the seeds. The real masses of capsules are disposed 
in a simple row, near the margin of each lobe, whence some 
have taken the plant for Polypodium marginale of Linnaeus, 
which is a very distinct North American species. When ripe 
these masses become nearly confluent, forming brown, mar- 
ginal, beaded lines. The cover of each mass is small and thin, 
fixed by the centre, jagged, and soon obliterated. 
I have seen no original specimen of Ray's plant, my ^ ; but the 
small ones, gathered on Ben Lomond in 1782, and then taken 
for Thelypteris, their resinous globules being noticed as some- 
thing peculiar, may very probably be this variety, though it by 
no means answers to the Filix pumila saxatilis altera of Clusius, 
which has a creeping root, and long naked stalks.

Root tufted, large, scaly. Fronds several, three feet high^ erect, not 
so regularly disposed in a circle as the foregoing, but of the 
same lanceolate shape, and leafy nearly to the bottom ; their 
stalks and midribs scaly, or chaffy, throughout. Leaves alter- 
nate, taper-pointed, pinnate. Leaflets numerous, crowded^ ses- 
sile, for the most part distinct, occasionally somewhat com- 
bined at the base, but far less so than the figures of the earlier 
writers represent them." Dr. Hooker's and Bulliard's plates are 
the most correct in this particular. Each leaflet is oblong, ob- 
tuse, crenate throughout, the lateral notches broadest and most 
shallow, the terminal ones more crowded and acute, without 
any terminal bristles ; both sides are smooth, destitute of glan- 
dular globules, but there is a depression on the upper one, over 
the insertion of each mass of capsules. These masses are cir- 
cular, tawny, ranged in simple, close, short rows, near the par- 
tial midrib, and scarcely occupying more than the lower half 
of each leaflet. Cover circular, durable, crenate, tumid, with 
  a cleft terminating in the central depression. Capsules nume- 
rous, of a shining brown^ prominent all round a little beyond 
the cover. 

The root is a famous Swiss remedy for intestinal worms, chiefly 
the Tape.worm, which in that country is a different species 
from cur's j see Sir Anthony Carlisle's paper on these ani- 
mals, in Tr. of Linn. Soc. v. 2. 247. The peculiar nauseous

flavour of this root was delected by a good botanist, who had 
taken it in Switzerland, in a quack medicine recommended for 
worms in England, the cunning dealer in which would be glad 
to bring it into general use as a purge. But there are many 
drugs more safe, and better known in their operation. 
This species was certainly never mistaken for A. cristatum by the 
writer o( Engl. BoL p. 1949 ; but Mr. Sowerby was deceived by 
a wrong specimen, sent him from the Isle of Wight, which he 
supposed, of course, to be correct, and from which he drew the 
figure. ITie blunder was set right in v. 30. /). 2125 of the same 
work.

Root tufted. Fronds several, quite erect, readily distinguished 
from the last, as Dr. Hooker observes, by their pale yellowish 
green hue. But the present species is well characterized by 
several other indisputable marks. Each frond, at most two feet 
high, is in its outline remarkably linear, not lanceolate ; nor is 
it leafy throughout, but the stalk, beset towards the bottom with 
large, rounded, brown, membranous scales, is destitute of leaves, 
or wings, for about one-third of its height from the root. Leaves 
tapering upwards from a broad base, quite smooth^ truly pin- 
nate, though their broad, ovate, blunt leaflets are decurrent, 
and therefore somewhat confluent ; their margins are sharply 
toothed, most copiously about the extremity, and the teeth end 
in very short bristles. Masses large, in simple rows, at an equal 
distance between the midrib of each leaflet and its margin. 
Cover tumid, white when fresh, permanent, soon becoming or-

Root tufted, large. Fronds numerous, spreading in a circle, each 
rather smaller than those oi A. Filix mas, of a dark blueish green, 
paler beneath, lanceolate, tapering to a point, firm and some- 
what rigid, elegantly, regularly, and closely twice pinnate, with 
a considerable very scaly stalk ; the midrib, and partial ribs also, 
being clothed with narrower scales, sometimes occurring still 
narrower, like hairs, on the backs of the leaflets. Leaves alter- 
nate, close together, linear-lanceolate, taper-pointed. Leajlets 
numerous, alternate, distinctly though rather shortly stalked, 
ovate inclining to lunate, with an oblique, acute, tapering point ; 
the serratures few and unequal, likewise taper-pointed, the 
lowermost of which, at the upper edge, forms more or less of a 
lobe, especially in the lowest leaflet, which is rather bigger 
than the rest. Masses smaller, and more remote, than in the 
two last. Cover orbicular, without a notch, flat, with a central 
protuberance when young. 

^, sometimes mistaken for A. Lonchitis, n. 1, is a starved variety, 
owing to a dry and barren soil. Plukenet's t. \79. f. 6 repre-

Softer and more delicate in texture, as well as more shaggy, than 
the last. The leajiets are smaller, more numerous, blunter, and 
rounded at the extremity, though tipped with a soft bristly 
point, and each of them, even to the smallest, has a broad con- 
spicuous lobe, at the base of the upper margin ; the lowest of 
all, at the upper edge of each main leaf, is half as long again as 
its next neighbour, more strongly serrated, and in its lower part 
generally pinnutifid. All the lobes and serratures end in soft 
bristly points. Stalk, and principal rib, densely covered with 
scales, which are narrower in proportion as they are higher up, 
those on the partial ribs, or on the leaflets occasionally, being 
almost capillary. Masses numerous and crowded. Couer orbi- 
cular, for the most part entire, with a central depression. The 
outline of the whole frond is rather broader than J. aculeatum, 
and the more copious, distinct, rounded, auricled leajiets give 
the whole a rich and elegant aspect. 

Having seen no specimen of Willdenow's plant, nor any figure 
being quoted by him, I cannot be certain that we mean the 
same thing. His description however is excellent, and without 
exception.

This is most akin to A. aculeatum, n. 6, but Ray, in his excellent 
Synopsis, has well marked their differences. The fronds of the 
present species, though nearly as long as in that, are narrower, 
the leaves, or pinnce, being shorter, and they are shorter still 
than in A. angulare. They are also more crowded, especially 
at the base, where the foremost leaflet of each lowermost pair 
lies close to the main rib, and is so much larger than any of the 
other leaflets, as to leave no vacancy along the middle part of 
the frond, sometimes overlaying the rib itself. The leaflets in 
general are rather larger than in either of the foregoing, more 
pointed, and of a firmer texture, as well as of a lighter or paler 
green, more polished, and less hairy, the main rib only being 
scaly, the partial ones but slightly so towards the base. The 
decurrent character of the leciflets was first pointed out to me 
by Mr. D. Turner. 

Plukenet's synonym, erroneously quoted in the F/. Brit., properly 
belongs to the small variety of A. aculeatum, where it is already 
indicated,

Root somewhat creeping. Fronds of a delicate light green, about 
a foot high, smooth in every part, except the base of the com- 
mon stalk ; their outline triangular, or deltoid, the lowermost 
of their leaves, or primary divisions, being longest. .Stalk about 
one-third of the whole frond in length, pale, slender, smooth 
and naked, except a few scales towards the bottom. Leaves not 
quite opposite ; lea/lets more generally so, gradually a little 
larger downward, but all tolerably equal and uniform, elliptical, 
bluntish, running down at the base into the narrow wings of 
their common stalk ; the middle rib of each zigzag, or serpen- 
tine ; the margin beset with broad, deep, incurved serratures, 
each tipped with a bristly point. Masses rather small and di- 
stant, in simple rows, or somewhat scattered, often towards the 
margin, or the notches, of the leaflets. Cover thin, orbicular 
when perfect, with a lateral fissure, but finally pushed aside by 
the swelling capsules. 

Dr, Swartz seems to confound this with the next, but they are 
perfectly and essentially distinct. Dr. Withering was the first 
systematic British botanist who determined the present species. 
Plukenef's figure is excellent, but the Filix puniila saxaiilis al- 
tera of Clusius, which Haller could not ascertain, and for which 
Parkinson mistook our fern, is evidently different. Morison's 
sect. 14. t. 3./. 1 1, quoted by Willdenow, uo less unquestion- 
ably belongs to something else, being perhaps the true ^. cris. 
latum, n. 5, which Bobart's herbarium at Oxford may possibly 
determine. The plant of Goodyer in Ger. Em. 1 1 29, to which 
Morison refers, a))pears to be our ^. dilatatum.

Root tuberous, scarcely creeping. Fronds various in size, gene- 
rally about two feet high, erect, broad and spreading, bright 
green, delicately and very copiously subdivided, being almost 
triply pinnate, so deeply are all the leaflets pinnatifid, with ob- 
long, obtuse, parallel, deeply serrated segments, their serratures 
sharp, each tipped with a small bristly point. The main stalk 
is slender, moderately scaly all the way up, but most so in its 
leafless part ; the partial ribs are also scaly, or roughish. All 
the subdivisions are partly opposite, partly alternate, the ulti- 
mate ones slightly decurrent, their midribs straight, some of 
them only a little zigzag. The secondary divisions, or leaves, 
of the lower principal ones are much larger and longer than 
their opposite neighbours. Masses very numerous, because the 
frond is large and so much subdivided, but they are less crowd- 
ed than in many ferns, though more so than in the last, they 
are first tumid and kidney-shaped, the lobes directed towards 
the base of each leaflet, or segment, but the cover when burst 
becomes orbicular^ witli a deep fissure at the lower side. The 
fruciijicction is situated nearer the midrib than the margin of 
each ieajlet in the present species ; in tlie following the reverse 
is observable. 

My learned friend Dr. F. Hamilton, late Buchanan, has sent from 
Lenev, near Stirling, along with my A. dUatatum, a specimen 
more precisely answering to Plukenet's t. 181./. 2, which he 
suspects may be different. This latter is rather more pale and 
delicate, but I cannot discern any specific distinction.

About one-third the size of the last, with which it agrees in general 
habit and structure, but the lectflets are rather more ovate, and 
their segments ir.ore closely crowded together, less serrated at 
the sides, but their bristly teeth more numerous at the extremity 
of each segment. J^Iasses few, small and rather scattered. 
Cover thin, pale, flat, not tumid nor kidney-shaped, but more 
orbicular, with a deep notch at the lower part, and finally turned 
loosely aside, by the few, rather large, shining, brown cap- 
sules, whose rings are very apparent. Sometimes the masfes 
are placed at the very edges or points of the segments, and the 
covers are often torn ; but they are never tumid, like a kidney, 
nor fixed closely by their outer margin, as those of A. dilatatum 
are. I think these two species may always be distinguished by 
the situation of their fructification, and the nature of their 
covers. 

Mr. Henry Shepherd, of the Botanic Garden, Liverpool, raised 
the A. dumetorum in plenty, from seed brushed from a Derby- 
shire specimen. The individuals, whether cultivated in pots or 
on rock-work, retain their original habit and characters, the 
largest not exceeding a foot in height. Others, from Scotland, 
have rather more distant lefijfets, with more spreading segments, 
but their fructifications agree, both differing alike from A. dila- 
tatum. The midribs of their leajiets accord with this last, and 
not at all with A. spinulosum.

An elegant fern about as tall as A. dilatatum, but narrower, and 
more lanceolate, in its general outline, being broadest towards 
the middle, quite smooth in every part, of a rich, rather deep, 
green. The root is large and tufted. Naked part of the sialic 
very short ; the whole destitute of scales. Primary divisions, 
or leaves, about forty, alternate, taper-pointed. Leojlets in 
each about as many, linear-oblong, bluntish, elegantly and 
finely pinnatifid, sharply notched, without bristly points ; the 
uppermost somewhat decu:rent. Masses solitary towards the 
base of each lobe, oblong, but finally becoming nearly round. 
Cover lateral, at first oblong, with a broad base ; subsequently 
kidney-s^haped, but not tumid ; and finally, as the ends con- 
verge, orbicular, with a broad notch at tiie base, assuming the 
precise character of Aspidium ; the outer edge rough or jagged. 
Capsules rather numerous, brown. 

Other figures, besides those above indicated, are referred by va- 
rious authors to this species, but they are either doubtful or in- 
accurate. 

Polypodium rhceticum of Linnaeus, preserved in the Linnsean her- 
barium, is merely a badly-dried specimen of the Filix fcemina. 
It was sent by Sauvages from Montpellier, with the synonym 
of John Bauhin, Filix rhcelica fetiuissim'i denticulata, and a re- 
ference to the tenth Polypodium of Haller's Enumeratio 140, an 
obscure plant, whose description does not answer to this fern. 
On the specimen of Sauvages iiowever, and on nothing else, 
Linnseus founded his P. rhceticum, in both editions of Sp. PI., 
and to this his specific character, and all he has said of the plant, 
every where refers. His P. rhceticum therefore is a nonentity, 
though thai name may remain with John Bauhin's plant, which 
seems to be different. P. rhceticum of other authors, having 
nothing to do with either, cannot retain the name. Its history 
will be found under the third species of the following genusi.

Scarcely one-fourth so large as the preceding, of which nevertheless 
some good botanists have thought it a variety ; and indeed after 
long cultivation, though raised originally from seed, it consi- 
derably approaches that species. In a wild state the fronds are 
of a more narrow lanceolate figure, and of a paler pellucid 
green ; the main stalk occasionally scaly, but in general quite 
smooth, and exactly quadrangular, though the latter circum- 
stance varies. Leaflets shorter, and somewhat less linear, than 
in Filix faniina, deeply serrated, or partly pinnatifid, their seg- 
ments sharply cut, without bristly points. Masses by the side 
of the midrib of a few of the lowermost lobes of each leaflet, 
solitary, oblong, though short, and ultimately roundish, or oval. 
Coter at first oblong, soon becoming kidney-shaped, or almost 
orbicular, with a lateral notch, flat, thin, membranous and jag- 
ged. Capsules dark brown.

Masses of capsules orbicular, convex, scattered variously 
over the back of the frond, between the midrib of each 
leaflet, or lobe, and the margin. Capsules several, glo- 
bose, on short stalks ; each of 1 cell, and 2 equal, hemi- 
spherical valves, bound together by a transverse jointed 
ring, which finally separates them, when dry, by its 
elasticity. Seeds numerous, roundish, very minute. Cover 
membranous, white, orbicular, concave, fixed by a nar- 
row point of attachment at the side of each viass under- 
neath ; at first enfolding the whole ; but subsequently 
separating, turned to one side, unequally jagged, flaccid 
and irregular, sometimes pointed ; finally obliterated, or 
concealed by the swelling capsules. 

Fronds oblong, of humble growth, erect, very delicate in 
habit, compound, finely cut. Stalk about half the length 
of the leafy portion, smooth. Leafets ovate or oblong, 
serrated, toothed, or wavy. Masses small, with a deli- 
cate, white, globular cover while young, which renders

In reviewing the whole order of Ferns, for the purpose of 
establishing their generic distinctions on better principles 
than had heretofore been suggested, I found the curious 
little family, which I am now about to describe, so dis- 
tinct in habit and characters from Polypodium, to which 
it had been referred, as well as from what is now termed 
Aspidium, that I could not associate it with either. The 
globular shape of its irivolucfum, or cover, added. to the 
insertion of that part underneath the capsules, its texture, 

  and other circumstances, led rae rather to comprehend 
these plants in the new genus Cyathea. This measure 
has not been approved ; and the universal opinion being 
against me, I so far submit. I cannot however agree 
with those, whether competent to form an opinion or not, 
who have referred them to Asjndium, and I pi'efer the 
adoption of Prof. Bernhardi's genus Cystopteris ; only 
retrenching the name as compounded of another esta- 
blished one, Pteris. Neither the genus nor its name 
having ever been received, such a necessary correction 
can cause no inconvenience. I wish the character given 
by this learned writer, and exhibited in his figure, were 
liable to no more exception ; but even his original spe- 
cies, C fragilis, has by no means constantly a bladder- 
like, ovate, pointed cover, split along one side, as he 
represents it. That part, though always at first wrapped 
about each mass of capsules, is, generally, but moderately 
concave ; being soon turned aside, and, in a more ad- 
vanced state, variously jagged. It has no central or pel- 
tate mode of attachment, nor any transverse fissure, 
which characters belong to Aspidium.

Root tufted, scaly, with black fibres. Fronds several together from 
4 to 10 or 12 inches high, lanceolate, pointed, smooth, of a full, 
though bright, green, doubly, or almost triply, pinnate. Stalk 
brown, or blackish, very brittle and juicy, occupying one-third, 
or nearly half, of the length of the whole, destitute of scales, 
except at its very base. The primary divisions, or leaves, are 
usually nearly opposite, acute, of a moderate length ; leaflets 
mostly alternate, ovate, acute, or pointed, in barren fronds 
sometimes blunter; their base always tapering and decurrent j 
they are by no means linear or oblong, nor is their margin 
wavy, but copiously, deeply and sharply toothed, and their 
substance is firm ; the larger and lower ones are deeply pinna- 
tifid, their lobes resembling the upper leaflets. Masses nu- 
merous and crowded, globular ; at first pale, but finally black- 
ish and confluent, covering the whole back of the frond. Cover 
white, flaccid, membranous, concave, irregularly jagged and 
torn, sometimes lengthened out into an oblong point, but soon 
turned back, and obliterated, or forced off, by the swelling 
shining capsules, which, in an early state, are often quite black, 
though subsequently browner. 

The application of Bauhin's synonym, adopted by Morison, as 
above, is strongly justified by the peculiar blackness of the cap- 
sules, contrasted, in an early state, with the white cover; though 
Morison's figure, which best agrees herewith, is referred by Dr. 
Withering to his Polypodium rhceticum, hereafter described. 
His citation of/. 8, instead of 28, caused me no little perplexity, 
but an examination of the plate may excuse him.

Rather smaller than C. fragilis, but agreeing with it in texture, 
colour, and general aspect. Root tufted, small. Frond for 
the most part correctly bipinnate, a few of the lower leajlets 
only, in luxuriant specimens, being pinnate, or pinnatifid. 
The leajlets are exactly ovate, or rounded, obtuse, pointless, 
copiously and bluntly serrated, or toothed ; their ribs wavy j 
their base not decurrent, though seated on a winged midrib. 
Masses prominent, at length entirely confluent, of a uniform, 
rich, chesnut brown. I do not perceive, in the younger ones, 
that peculiar blackness which is observable in the foregoing. 
The cover is short, jagged, concave. I have never seen it in an 
early state, before bursting. 

Prof. Hoffmann, in his Flora Germanica, adverts to this plant 
under C. fragilis, but I think he possibly may never have seen 
a specimen. It does not answer to any of his figures of sup- 
posed varieties of that species, in Roemer and Usteri's Maga- 
zine. The ovate shape, and indentations, of the leajlets are 
very characteristic, differing from all varieties of the fragilis, 
and still more from every other species, whether British or 
exotic.

Root tufted, or somewhat creeping, black, with long fibres, and 
rusty scales. Fronds several, erect, twelve or fifteen inches 
high, of wlych the slender, blackish, smooth and naked staZA; 
occupies more than one-third, sometimes nearly half ; the mid- 
rib above is still more slender, and, like every other part, quite 
smooth, without any membranous border. Main wings, or 
leaves, bright green, from twelve to fifteen pair, of a moderate 
length, nearly opposite, taper-pointed ; the lowermost rather 
shorter, and more remote from the next, than those about the 
middle of each frond ; all pinnate, with a scarcely bordered mid- 
rib. Leaflets about ten at each side, alternate, lanceolate, 
decurrent, rather bluntly pointed, sometimes tapering at the 
extremity; all either deeply pinnatifid, with oblong, acute, 
wavy segments ; or, in less luxuriant plants, sliglitly pinnatifid, 



202 CRYPTOGAMIA— FILICES. Cystea. 

or only wavy at the margin j the ribs of all more or less wavy. 
The ultimate divisions, in every instance, are oblong or linear, 
never dilated, rounded, or ovate ; they are sometimes, though 
seldom, notched or cloven at the end. By this linear, or oblong, 
mode of division, and its thinner more pliant texture, the present 
species may readily be known from both the preceding, with 
which it has generally been confounded. The masses of capsules, 
much smaller, and less prominent, than in those species, always 
continue distinct, standing either solitary or in pairs, towards 
the bottom of each lobe or tooth, and are round, at first pale, 
subsequently brown. Cover white, very thin, concave, irre- 
gularly torn, soon pushed off, or turned aside, by the com- 
paratively large, though far from numerous, shining brown cap- 
sules. 

Great confusion has always existed amongst our British botanists 
concerning Polypodium rhceticum. Hooker has it not. Light- 
foot appears, by what he says in his Fl. Scot. 678, to have been 
acquainted, like Mr. Dickson, with our Cystea angustata under 
that name ; and he quotes Gerarde rightly, justly objecting to 
Plukenet's ^.179./. 5. Lightfoot's description is excellent, 
though he submits, as I have formerly done, to Haller, Weis, 
and others, who consider it as a variety of our C.fragilis. The 
late Mr. Davall took it for Haller's n. 1705; but that plant, 
with many errors in the synonyms, is certainly Aspidium 
dilatatum. Our Cystea angustata may be n. 1708 of Haller, but 
his references are confused. Mr. Hudson, on seeing Mr. Davall's 
specimens of the Fern in question, declared it very different from 
his own Polypodium rhceticum, which indeed is Aspidium dume- 
torum. I have little scruple in referring the obscure and long- 
disputed figure of Clusius, reprinted in Gerarde, as above 
quoted, to this Cystea angustata, though the draughtsman has 
omitted the ultimate divisions of the lenjlets, well enough ex- 
pressed by Hoffmann and Villars. I have never received this 
Fern from Wales, but if it be not Ray's Polypodium ilvense, it 

• is wanting in the Si/nopsis. The wooden cut of Dalechamp, 
copied in J. Bauhin, and quoted doubtingly by Ray, should 
rather seem to be the totally different Acrostichuvi Marantce, 
as Bauhin himself suspected.

Root tufted, scaly. Fronds several, from three to ten or twelve 
inches high, bright green, lanceolate, twice pinnate, pinnatifid 
and finely cut, of a most elegant appearance, quite smooth in 
every part, except a few membranous, torn, pointed, brown 
scales, at the very bottom of the stalk, which is less brittle and 
juicy than that oi C.fragilis. Leaves and leaflets more generally 
alternate than opposite ; the former with a narrowly winged, or 
bordered, midrib ; the latter ovate, obtuse, deeply pinnatifid, 
with elliptic-oblong, obtuse, partly cloven or notched segments, 
but not elongated, linear, or wavy at the margin like C. angus- 
tata, neither are their ribs zigzag as in that species. Masses of 
capsules very copious, but small, pale, scattered, not crowded, 
nor do they appear ever to become confluent. In a young state, 
each is wrapped up in a white, membranous, concave cover, 
terminating in a tapering, more or less jagged, point, nearly 
agreeing with Cfragilis, but the masses are much smaller, and 
the capsules of a pale brown, never black. 
The lowland station of this Fern, close to a much-frequented road 
at Low Layton, where I have, in company with the late Mr. Fors- 
ter, seen it covering great part of a brick wall, may be supposed 
analogous to its places of growth in France ; but we seek in 
vain for any information on this head either in Vaillant or La- 
marck, nor is it evident that the latter ever found the plant. 
The wall at Layton has been repaired, and the Fern almost 
destroyed. On Snowdon it is said to be very scarce, though 
Mr. Wilson, with his usual bounty, has sent me an ample sup- 
ply of specimens of various sizes. He describes it as " varying

greatly in size and appearance, but always distinct from the 
fragilis." The cocer, as that gentleman remarks, " is in both 
species, connected with the/ro»d by its base only, at the lower 
side of the viass of capsules, that is, on the side next the base 
of the segment of the leaflet ,•" which agrees with my obser- 
vations. This Fern is well compared by Bobart, in Morison, 
to the Cicutaria of old authors, our ChcErophyllum sylvestre, see 
V. 2. 48, BO common on banks in the spring. It is unquestion- 
ably distinct from every other British Fern, though the proper 
name and synonyms were not discovered till after its appearance 
in Engl. Bot, where I fell into the same error with some foreign 
botanists. Linnaeus once thought it a Swedish plant, but erro- 
neously, nor had he an originator authentic specimen. 

The remarks of Dr. Richardson, inserted between brackets, by 
Dillenius, in the third edition of Ray's Synopsis, 126. n.8, cer- 
tainly do not answer to the present species ; as my late friend 
the Rev. Hugh Davies, an excellent observer, first pointed out 
to me. 

John Bauhin's synonym, which Ray quoted with doubt, appears, 
by the really excellent figure, to be unquestionably our plant. 
It must be either this or Aspidium alpinum, Willd. n. 139, 
which is likewise a Cystea, figured in Jacq. Ic. Rar. t. 642, and 
in Segu. Veron. suppl. t. I./. 3. But neither the plant itself 
nor either of these representations, suits the wooden cut of Bau- 
hin, which agrees far better with C. regia, particularly in the 
shape of the leaflets. Haller, very unsuitably I think, refers it 
to Pter'is crispa; which circumstance, and the singular jumble 
of synonyms under his n. 1707, Cystea fragilis, induces a sus- 
picion that he had not accurately observed these alpine ferns, 
and especially that he had never seen Vaillanfs Filicula regia 
at all.

The variety /3, more deeply crenute and jagged than ordinaiy, 
sent tVoin Scotland by Dr. Alston to P. Collinson, and assuredly 
what Sibbald has figured, was taken by Mr. Hudson for Adian- 
tum trapezifo7-me of Linnaeus. Sibbald's rude engravings nnay 
very well excuse this mistake ; but the latter is a real Adian- 
tum, copiously branched, well delineated in Sloane, Plukenet 
and Plumier, a native of the West Indies, not of Europe. The 
late Bishop of Carlisle has observed Asplenium marinum growing 
very luxuriantly in deep fissures of rocks ; while, on the other 
hand, Mr. Lightfoot found it, in the coves at Weems, just in 
the dwarfj though jagged, state exhibited by Sibbald.

at the extremity, with pointed or bristly teeth, and branching 
veins. Masses several, short, elliptic-oblong, crowded about 
the middle of each leaflet or lobe, and after a while confluent, 
spreading nearly over the whole. Cover oblong, whitish, with 
a jagged margin, always separating at the side towards the 
midrib. Capsules prominent, of a rusty brown. 

A very distinct and handsome species, little known except in some 
parts of England and France. In an advanced state the aggre- 
gate masses of capsules become roundish, so that, without an 
examination of the covers, the plant might be taken for a Poly- 
podium or Aspidium.

CRYPTOGAMIA— FILICES. Scolopendrium, 313 

Perennial. June — September. 

A most elegant little Fern, with a large tufted black root, of many 
long smooth fibres, the crown slightly scaly. Fronds severalj 
erect, from two to six inches high, very smooth, of a light, some- 
what glaucous, green, linear-lanceolate, narrow, taper-pointed, 
of a firm texture, doubly and copiously pinnate ; leaves alter- 
nate, broadest at their base, pinnate, or in the smaller specimens 
pinnatifid ; leaflets, or lobes, obovate, with from two to four 
deep, broad, sharp, spreading, partially spinous, teeth, or lobes, 
so as to be in some measure palmate ; their veins branching. 
General and partial stalks all equally winged throughout ; the 
former bearing a few narrow pointed scales at the very bottom 
only. Masses mostly solitary on the ultimate lobes or leaflets, 
short, roundish-oblong. Cover oblong, firm, white, durable, 
broad at the base, originating from the midrib of the lobe, or 
incomplete leaflet, separating towards the next principal rib, 
and not towards the margin. Capsules numerous, prominent, 
of a rusty brown. 

There is certainly a very strict relationship between this Fern and 
the last, both belonging to the genus Asplenium on account of 
the oblong shape of the cover, attached by its broad base to the 
midrib of some leaflet or lobe, and remaining unaltered in shape, 
as well as insertion. Whereas the cover of every Aspidium, 
though sometimes oblong at first, soon becomes lunate, or even 
orbicular, attached by a small or narrow point only, of which 
Aspidium Filix fcemina is the most remarkable example. On this 
subject, though long misled by the vague ideas of others, I have 
endeavoured at last to be correct. The intelligent reader will 
be able to trace my errors, and if any yet remain, will perhaps 
still further correct me. Professor Willdenow, though by far 
the best botanist in this department, appears to have made some 
mistakes, nor can I discern the grounds on which his Aspidium 
Halleri is separated from the fontanum, unless by the latter he 
understood our Woodsia hyperhorea, as I once, but erroneously, 
supposed Swartz had done. 

The naxae fontanum, taken from Tabernsemontanus, is perhaps not 
very suitable to this species, which, though it grows in shady 
spots, does not appear to be stationed near fountains or rivu- 
lets ; nor may the synonym of that old writer be absolutely cer- 
tain, though his figure is not unlike. Of the synonyms of Tourne- 
fort and Haller there is no doubt, and whatever may be thought of 
its genus, I tmst this species can never hereafter be mistaken.

twelve or eighteen inches high, stalked, lanceolate, acute, of a 
full grass green, entire, or somewhat wavy, smooth, except the 
stalk, and back of the midrib, which are shaggy with narrow 
membranous scales ; the base heartshaped, but not dilated in 
breadth ; the summit occasionally cut into a number of seg- 
ments, more or less deep ; sometimes the margin is considerably 
crisped and jagged. Masses of fructification chiefly about the 
upper half of each frond, obliquely transverse, parallel, various 
in length, either quite linear and narrow, or shorter and broader, 
slightly elliptical, tumid, of innumerable small brown capsules, 
the linear, uninterrupted, membranous covers, which in an early 
state had folded over them, remaining, one at each side, nearly 
erect. 
When bruised, the whole plant has a nauseous scent j to the taste 
, it is mucilaginous and acrid. The medical virtues formerly at- 
tributed to this Fern being now entirely disregarded, I prefer 
its old appellation, vulgare, as a specific name, to a more 
modern one which might lead to an erroneous idea of its use 
in medicine.

31G CRYPTOGAMIA— FILICES. Blechnum. 

Perennial. At almost all seasons. 

Root fibrous, black, tufted ; scaly at the crown. Fronds nume- 
rous, tufted, spreading, from three to six inches high, leathery, 
oblong, bluntish, deeply and bluntly sinuated in an alternate 
order, the margin entire ; upper surface smooth, of a deep, 
slightly glaucous, opaque green, with a scaly midrib, but no 
apparent veins ; under thickly clothed with lanceolate, acute, 
membranous, rusty scales. Stalks hardly one-fourth the length 
of the whole. Masses oblong, in two obliquely transverse rows 
on each lobe, imbedded in the scales of the frond. Covers one 
at each side of each mass, as in the preceding species, erect, 
membranous, continuous, undulated, entire, quite distinct from 
the pointed separate scales. 

I cannot ascertain whether the lines of capsules are originally 
double as in Scolopendrlum vulgare, but the covers are evidently 
such as to leave no doubt of the genus, answering exactly to 
Tournefort's figure, which Swartz and Willdenow surely did 
not examine. The latter indeed has well removed this Fern 
from Grammitis, to which it has no natural affinity.

the barren ones ot numerous, close, parallel, lanceolate, entire, 
single-ribbed leaflets, bluntish with a minute point, their base 
scarcely at all dilated, or auricled ; fertile ones interior, or cen-

rather more distant, more acute leciflets, dilated at the base. 
Masses in continuous, solitary, lines, close to each partial

brown capsules, each bound with a jointed ring. 

Haller justly observed this could be no Osmunda. It is wonderful 
Linnaeus, who founded the very natural well-marked genus 
Blechnum, never discovered that this Fern belonged to it j a fact 
first published in the Turin Memoirs above quoted.

branous, inflexed, narrow, inner cover, contrary or oppo- 
site to the outer one, and in like manner fringed, has 
been observed by the late Mi-. Thomas Smith, F.L.S., 
as well as by Mr. Brown. This ought perhaps to form 
a part of the generic character of a true Pteris ; those 
tropical, more membranous, species, which, according 
to Mr. Brown, have it not, constituting a separate genus. 
Yet I doubt its existence in P. crispa, which can be de- 
termined by those only who have opportunities of examin- 
ing this rare mountain species in a gjowing state. See

erect, from one to six feet high, repeatedly compound, with 
horizontally spreading branches, whose ribs are smooth ; the 
primary ones nearly opposite j the next more alternate, deeply 
pinnatifid, with crowded, lanceolate, bluntish, convex, parallel 
segments ; the odd one generally much the largest ; lateral ones 
sometimes greatly diminished ; all of a light bright green j re-

Barren leajiets pale and hairy at the back. The main Malk is

angular and sharp-edged, wounding the hands severely if plucked 
incautiously. When cut across, the pith has a branched ap- 
pearance, resembling' a spread-eagle, whence the latin name. 

The variety /3 is singularly delicate, with rounded, more distant, 
barren leaflets or segments, and very slender stalks. Dillenius 
says it once grew on a wall in Chelsea garden, where by send- 
ing down roots into the ground, it acquired the proper appear- 
ance of this species. 

This common Fern is impatient of severe cold in the spring, and its 
curled scaly shoots will scarcely bear any frost, though its natural 
situation is often the most exposed and bleak possible. The 
roots are generally killed by transplantation.

undivided, turgid, likewise stalked, leaflets, whose broad, 
brown, wavy, crenate, reflexed margins nearly meet over the 
midrib, and cover the two linear dense masses of capsules, 
which, as far as I can discern in dried specimens, are unaccom- 
panied by any opposite or internal membrane.

Dr. Swartz first separated from Adiantxim a few species, 
under the name of Cheilanthes, in which the capsules are 
situated upon the frond, as was always supposed to be 
the case in Adiantwn itself; but it is otherwise in the 
original species. The difference indeed is often very 
hard to be discerned, the character of some species being 
rather ambiguous. Brown and Willdenow however 
have stamped this new genus with their weighty autho- 
rity, and the former of these writers describes the disk 
of each scale, or cover, in Adiantum, where the capsules 
are inserted, as veiny, the unattached margin only being 
membranous.

At Barry island, and port Kirig, Glamorganshire. Mr. Lhwijd. 
In the isle of Arran, near Galloway. Mr. Stonestreet, according 
toSherard's herbarium. Gathered in the south islands of Arran 
in 1805, by Mr. J. T. Mackoy. Found by Prof. Beattie on the 
banks of the Carron, a rivulet in Kincardineshire. Hooker. 

Perennial. May — September. 

A most elegant fern, especially when it projects from the sides 
of upright dripping rocks, or caves. The root is slightly creep- 
ing, blackish, shaggy. Fronds from six to twelve inches high, 
rarely more in this country, erect or drooping, alternately and 
doubly pinnate ; their stalks slender, of a purplish black, smooth 
and polished ; the ultimate ones quite capillary, whence the 
name of Maidenhair, and of Capillary Herbs, subsequently ex- 
tended to this whole Natural Order. Leaflets deep green, smooth, 
wedge- or fan -shaped, very various in width ; the base entire ; 
upper, or outer, margin variously jagged and lobed ; when bar- 
ren sharply serrated ; when fertile, as is most usual, each seg- 
ment terminates in a roundish, reflexed, flat, brown scale, thin 
and pale at its edges, sometimes broader than long, usually sup- 
posed to cover the fructification seated on the frond ; but Dr. 
Swartz first observed each round mass of capsules to be actually 
borne by the central part of this scale, or cover, underneath. 

One species of this genus, A.pedatum, is principally used, in the 
south of France, to make a syrup, which being perfumed with 
orange flowers, is called Capillaire, and known by that name 
throughout Europe, as a refreshing beverage when diluted with 
water. Ray in \\\s Historia,v. 1. 147, 148, attributes almost 
every possible medical virtue to the Capillus Veneris, (probably 
confounded with A.pedatum,) on the authority of a Montpellier 
physician.

Masses of capsules roundish, convex, dispersed on the veins 
at the back of the frond. Cover membranous and sHghtly 
cup-shaped at the base, under each mass ; the margin 
in many deep, capillary, obscurely jointed, taper-pointed 
segments, incurved over the capsides,Tpevxaax\eni. Capsules 
several, stalked, crowded, without any prominent com- 
mon receptacle, roundish-obovate, bound by a vertical 
jointed ring, and bursting (as it seems) irregularly at the 
sides. iS^^rfs numerous, kidney-shaped. 

A genus of smsW. ferns, of which two species only have hi- 
therto been discovered. These have been generally con- 
founded either with Acrostichum or Polypodium. Their 
700/5 are fibrous. Fronds tufted, erect, stalked, pinnate, 
pinnatifid, clothed with simple hairs, or naiTow pointed 
scales. 

The name, given by Mr. Brown, justly commemorates Mr. 
Joseph Woods, F.L.S., an excellent practical English 
botanist, who first illustrated our native species of Mosa ,•

Perennial. Jrdy — September. 

Mr. Wilson first determined this species when he gathered it in 
Wales, in 1824 and 1825; our English specimens having been 
sent under the name of the following ; a very excusable error,

when it is considered how nearly the plants are related. Roots 
tufted, of numerous, long, smooth, blackish, simple fibres. 
Fronds several, tufted, erect, from three to five inches high ; 
the slightly scaly, pale brown stalk, remarkably elastic and 
wiry, making about one-third of the whole. Leaflets from six- 
teen to twenty, nearly opposite, oblong, bluntly pointed, deeply 
pinnatifid, with segments of the same shape, slightly revolute 
at the margin, and somewhat wavy, scarcely crenate ; the upper 
surface of a rather glaucous green, even, besprinkled with a few 
hairs, or slender tapering scales j under more densely scaly, 
nearly covered with fructification. Masses orbicular, crowded, 
slightly prominent, each of about six or seven roundish-ovate 
capsules, seated on a small, membranous, roundish cover, whose 
margin, as Mr. Brown first discovered, is fringed with very long, 
taper, jointed, hair-like segments. 
Exotic specimens, especially those from North America, are larger 
than our's, but do not otherwise differ. When Linnaeus first 
began to use specific names, he adopted that of ilvense, from 
the newly discovered synonym of Dalechamp, for this supposed 
Acrostichum, first observed in the isle of Elba (Itoa). This 
affords but an additional proof of the absurdity of such names, 
which when established, like the present, may be tolerated, 
but will never be imitated by any person who can contrive a 
better.

Rather smaller than the foregoing, and less; upright, with a more

similar.

of a permanent cj'lindrical common receptacle, whose ca- 
pillary naked point projects beyond the cover, each 
rotmdish. of 2 valves, bound by a vertical jointed ring. 

A numerous genus of herbaceous ferns, with creeping, 
seldom tufted, roots, of many crooked fibres. Fiend 
pellucid, veiny, either undivided, lobed, or copiously 
pinnatifid, with decurrent, entire or serrated, segments, 
the whole mostly of a dull or brownish green. Covers 
either forming a marginal series, or solitary at the ends 
of the segments, each terminating a rib, or vein ; very 
rarely racemose and leafless. Natives of wet rocks, or 
trunks of trees, principally in tropical countries. We have 
only one species, which is extremely rare, and till lately 
has been greatly misunderstood.

head of a remarkable spring. Dr. Richardson. Found there, 
by Mr. Dickson and Mr. R. Teesdale, long afterwards, in a 
young state only, liVe Jig. 4. Gathered, in fructification, upon 
rocks near the cascade, at the bottom of Turk mountain, Killar- 
ney, Ireland. Mr. J. T. Mackay. 

Perennial. May, June. 

The root is creeping, cylindrical, black and downy, with several, 
scattered, branched, vertical, stout, downy radicles. Fronds 
springing solitarily, here and there, from the upper side of the 
horizontal root, erect, four or five inches high, smooth, of a 
deep transparent green, ovate-oblong, about thrice alternately 
pinnatifid, with a winged stalk; the segments uniform, linear, 
single-ribbed, obtuse, entire, decurrent : a few of the upper- 
most terminating each in a solitary, imbedded, oblong or cylin- 
drical, somewhat urn-shaped cover, continued from the leaf, 
slightly winged at the sides, a little dilated, not lobed, at the 
orifice. Capsules in a round mass, attached to the base of a 
cylindrical slender receptacle, or column, which in an early state 
does not project beyond the cover; but afterwards acquires 
three or four times the length of that part, and is nearly as 
prominent as in any other Trichomanes. The name of alatum, 
therefore, would have been far preferable to brevisetum, had it 
not been already applied by Willdenow to his 1 7th species.

The roots are long, slender, smooth, wiry, creeping horizontally. 
Fronds scattered, erect, about one-third the size of the Tricho- 
manes last described, and like that, smooth, of a filmy pellucid 
texture, curling up as they dry ; the stalk wiry, without any 
wing or border; segments linear, obtuse, single-ribbed, sharply 
toothed, especially in their upper part. Covers of two erect, 
converging, nearly orbicular, equal leaves, toothed in like man- 
ner, solitary at the base of the primary divisions, on the upper 
edge, with more or less of a stalk. Dr. Hooker's figures and 
history of this and the foregoing are peculiarly excellent. 

Mr. Menzies brought the present plant from the Cape of Good 
Hope ; and it grows in most parts of Europe, from Norway to 
Italy, but has not been observed in Germany or Switzerland.

Perennial. June, July. 

Root tuberous, hard, scaly, beset with numerous fibres, and having 
in the centre a whitish core, which some persons, according to 
Gerarde, have named the heart of Osmund the Water-man. 
Fronds several, erect, two or three feet high, doubly pinnate, 
smooth, bright green ; the primary divisions from six to ten, 
nearly opposite, hardly a span long ; leajlets more numerous, 
often decidedly alternate, sessile, or nearly so, oblong, bluntish, 
entire, or obscurely crenate, with one rib, and numerous trans- 
verse veins ; the base dilated, heart-shaped, or somewhat lobcd. 
Some of the upper leaflets are cut, and as it were partially trans- 
muted into dense clusters, or spikes, of capsules, several of the 
upper divisions of the frond consisting entirely of such capsules, 
composing a compound panicle. Each capsule is light brown, 
veiny, supported by a short stalk. Nothing has been discovered 
of the stigma, barren powers, or mode of impregnation. The 
seeds are numerous, nearly globular. 

The name of Osmunda appears to have originated in England. 
Osmund, in Saxon, is the proper name of a man, said to mean 
domestic peace : so that Osmunda is nearly equivalent to Lysi-

machia, or Loosestrife. De Theis gives it as one of the appel- 
lations of Tlior ; but he was the god of war. I have presumed^ 
from Gerarde's account, that it might, like many other names 
of plants, commemorate some particular person, but this is 
mere conjecture. 
Dr. Hooker justly celebrates the beauty of this Fern. Its reputed 
"strengthening and healing" virtues are very problematical.

Perennial. June. 

Root of several, simple^ cylindrical, clustered or whorled, fibres. 
Herb very smooth, a little succulent, of a pale opaque green, 
erect, not a span high. Comvion stalk simple, cylindrical, pale, 
with a few large, brownish, sheathing scales at the bottom ; a 
stalked, pinnate, upright leaf about the middle, consisting of 
five or six pair of fan-shaped, or crescent-like, stalked leaflets, 
with an odd one, all notched or cut ; and a terminal, twice 
compound spike of small, round, brownish capsules, nearly ses- 
sile on one flat side of a linear common stalk, or receptacle. 

jS has a branched stalk, bearing several leaves and compound 
spikes, alternately disposed, y is a very slight variety, with 
more jagged leaflets than ordinary. S has pinnatifid leaflets, 
and a more spreading habit. All these varieties, and perhaps 
others, are found occasionally, intermixed here and there, with 
the plant in its proper or common form ; but never, as far as I 
could learn, so numerously distinct, as to have the appearance 
of a different species. 

An ointment made of this herb, rubbed on the loins about tiie 
region of the kidneys, is recorded by Kay, on the authority of 
Needham, as an infallible remedy for the dysentery ; but Haller 
remarks, that if we believe this, or any other of its restringent 
properties, on the report of authors, we are not to give credit 
to its magical virtues. These have been attributed to this, and 
various other plants, in which some resemblance to the moon 
was imagined. Even Conrad Gesner condescended to give an 
account of such plants, and Thomas Bartholin republished his 
treatise, with a few wooden cuts, at Copenhagen, in 1669.

Caps, axillary, solitary, sessile, roundish, slightly com- 
pressed, of 2 equal valves, and 1 cell, bursting verti- 
cally. Seeds numerous, chaffy, very minute. 

Some species produce, besides these proper capsules, others 
with 2 or 3 tumid valves, containing several, Mr. Brown 
says from 1 to 6, globose bodies, whose real nature has 
not been ascertained, and which may possibly be g^^ffzwzdT, 
like those of viviparous flowers. Mr. Joseph Fox, late 
of Norwich, and Mr. Lindsay of Jamaica, have proved 
the chaffy seeds above-mentioned to be really seeds., and 
have raised abundance of plants from them. See Tr. 
of Linn. Soc. v.2. 313 — 315. This fact seems to have 
escaped Dr. Wahlenberg, who has several excellent re- 
marks on the subject, in his Fl. Lapp. 290 — 293. L'-n- 
ngeus took the capsides for anthers. 

The habit of this genus is peculiar, more resembling Mosses 
than Ferns. Stem mostly branched, either upright or

ti-ailing, densely leafy. Leaves small and narx'ow, in 
several rows, sessile, simple, undivided, either entire or 
serrated, of a dry and rigid substance, evergreen ; those 
which are accompanied by capsules diminished, in some 
species, to the scales of a spike, with elongated points. 
Caps, pale yellow, small, naked. Seeds often highly in- 
flammable, like powdered sulphur.

Roots of several strong scattered fibres. Stems procumbent, trail-

curved upwards, linear-lanceolate, flat, ribless, smooth, deep 
green, partly serrated, tipped with a capillary point ; those of 
the branches erect ; the upper ones loosely dispersed. Spikes 
terminal, usually in pairs, rarely one, or three, densely beset 
with shortened, dilated, ovate, entire, long-pointed leaves, or 
scales, in whose bosoms the small, sulphur-coloured capsules 
are situated. I never heard of more than the usual kind, whose 
minute, copious, volatile seeds are used in Germany for artifi- 
cial lightning on the stage, and are sold in the shops. When 
dispersed in the air, they take fire with a candle, and suddenly 
explode.

over. Leaves uniform, crowded, in eight rows, of a bright shi- 
ning green, permanent, lanceolate, entire, acute, pointless, mo- 
derately spreading every way. Caps, on the uppermost shoots, 
axillary, kidney-shaped, uniform, with plenty of minute seeds, 
from which Mr. J. Fox of Norwich, by allowing them to scatter 
themselves on wet sandy bog-earth, raised living plants, before 
the year 1779, as recorded in Tr. of Linn. Sac. v. 2. 315. Buds 
are sometimes produced in the place of capsules ; see Engl. Bot. 

Lightfoot records that the highlanders use this plant, instead of 
alum, to fix colours in dyeing ; and that they sometimes take 
an infusion of it, as an emetic and cathartic, though it operates 
violently, and, unless in a small dose, brings on giddiness and

Perennial. June — August. 

A large and handsome species, often a foot high, though the lower 
part of the stem is recumbent and creeping, throwing out seve- 
ral branched radicles. The flowering branches are erect, densely 
leafy, but little subdivided, each terminating in a solitary up- 
right spike, whose scales being deciduous, seem to leave the 
branch partly naked ; but it afterwards bears proper leaves, ex- 
cept a few diminished ones, just under where the spike had been, 
and produces, in the following season, another spike. Hence 
the jointed, or interrupted, aspect of the branches. The leaves 
are crowded, spreading in five rows, lanceolate, nearly flat, 
somewhat serrated, with a sharp naked point, but not awned, 
nor bearded. Spikes rather tawny, an inch, or when at matu- 
rity an inch and half, long ; their scales shortened, and much 
dilated in width, assuming an ovate, or sometimes a kidney- like, 
shape, though always pointed. Caps, kidney-shaped, but smaller. 

We have this species from North America, and Mr. Menzies 
brought it also from Banks's isles, on the north-west coast of 
that continent.

Stems round, strong, smooth, somewhat leafy, prostrate, creep- 
ing, by means of scattered fibrous radicles, to a considerable 
extent, and bearing many tufts of upright, forked, densely leafy, 
level-topped, partly flowering, branches, from two to four inches 
high. Leaves of a deep glaucous green, rather loosely imbri- 
cated in four rows, small, acute, keeled, uniform, entire, point- 
less. Spikes numerous, solitary, erect, cylindrical, from half an 
inch to an inch long, of a pale yellowish green. Scales ovate, 
pointed, not quite entire, flat, membranous. Caps, nearly orbi- 
cular, yellowish, uniform. 

A very handsome evergreen, with much of the aspect of a Juniper 
or Savin. It is bitter, with something of an aromatic flavour, 
and an emetic quality ; but though so abundant in Scotland 
and the Hebrides, Lightfoot does not mention its being applied 
to any use. 

Dillenius, though he well knew this species, and has correctly de- 
lineated the exotic L. complunatum, certainly misapplied syno- 
nyms of Tragus, Gerarde, Dalechamp and the two Bauhins, to 
L. alpinum, which belong to the complanatum. The taller, less 
leafy, flowering branches, well represented in the old wooden 
figures of the above authors, are decidedly characteristic of 
L. complanatum, to say nothing of the compressed foliage.

globular seeds. Every seed, or germen, is encompassed 
with 4 spiral Jilavients, attached to its base, and termi- 
nating in 4 dilated flat appendages, taken by Hedwig for 
anthers, and producing a fine powder, or 'pollen. 
Roots perennial, creeping. Stems herbaceous, more or less 
branched, furrowed, tubular, jointed, with a cylindrical, 
sharp-toothed, membranous sheath, arising from each 
joint, and embracing a portion of the stem or branch 
above it. Leaves none. Catkins terminal, stalked, soli- 
tary, erect, naked, brown or blackish. Some species 
bear them singly, on simple, radical, many-sheathed 
shoots, soon withering away, betbre the copiously- 
branched sterile fronds appear. In others they termi- 
nate the proper _//-o?i(i. Several, like Grasses, secrete 
a quantity of flinty earth, mostly lodged in their cuticle. 
They are natives of marshy or watery situations, chiefly 
in cold or temperate climates. Many of the older syno- 
nyms are very obscure.

This is by far our largest species, differing from the foregoing in 
bearing the fructification on a separate stem from the branched 
or whorled /rowcZ; as is likewise the case with the following one, 
-E. arvense. All the others, hitherto observed in Britain, have 
terminal catkins, at the tops of the/ronds. The sterile stems of 
E.Jluviatile are quite erect, at least a yard high, often much 
more, furnished from top to bottom with whorls ot numerous, 
long, slender, minutely rough, distantly jointed, not often 
divided, branches, whose four angles have each a longitudinal 
furrow, first noticed by Mr. J. D. Sowerby, constituting a clear 
distinction between the present species and the next. Each 
joint is crowned by a small sheath, having four or five long pale 
teeth. The large cylindrical catkins stand upon much shorter 
unbranched stems, appearing before the others, invested with 
nine or ten pale, tubular, ribbed sheaths, nearly close together, 
each of which terminates in a fringe of long, upright, brown 
teeth, amounting, as Haller observes, to forty. In the next 
species they are scarcely half so many, and the sheaths are but 
about three or four, rarely five, on each stem.

Perennial. March, April. 

Root much branched, creeping extensively, producing in the spring 
several simple, upright, flowering stems, quite destitute of 
branches, a span high, cylindrical, smooth, juicy, of a pale 
brown, bearing three or four, rather distant, membranous, 
cylindrical, brown-ribbed sheaths, with about twenty deep, 
sharp, darker, upright teeth, or segments ; and at the top a 
solitary, ovate-oblong, brown catkin-, whose scales, when ripe, 
separate, and show the white cells, as in other species. After 
the flowering shoots are withered the green sterile fronds ap- 
pear, twice or thrice as long as the former, either upright or 
decumbent, beset from top to bottom with many whorls of slender, 
jointed, spreading, roughish, green branches, mostly simple, with 
simple angles ; the lower ones sometimes elongated or branched ; 
their joints surmounted by small pale sheaths. These fronds are 
reckoned unwholesome to such animals as feed upon them in

In spongy watery bogs not uncommon. 

Perennial. June, July, 

Stem rather slender, deeply furrowed, beset throughout with whorls 
of slender, ascending, deeply furrowed, angular, minutely rough 
branches, whose joints are each crowned with a small deeplv- 
toothed sheath, often paler than in the foregoing. The terminal 
catkin, always solitary, at the top of the frond, most essentially 
distinguishes this species from E. arvense, agreeing so far with 
the following, but is more slender and cylindrical than either. 

The variety /3 I have not examined ; the y is similar to what oc- 
curs in E. limosum, confounded with the present by Haller. 

5. E. limosum. Smooth Naked Horsetail. 

Stem partially naked, striated, smooth as well as the 
branches. Catkin terminal, elliptical.

In marshy watery places frequent. 

Perennial. June, July. 

Stems stouter than the last, about two feet high, very smooth to 
the touch, though finely striated, not deeply furrowed ; either 
quite simple, or more usually furnished, in the upper part, with 
several simple, ascending, shortish 6ranc/ies, striated and smooth 
like the stem. Sheaths rather short, with manv short brown 
teeth. Catkin large, elliptical, bluntish. 

One Swiss specimen, from Mr. Davall, has a small catkin at the 
summit of each branch of the three uppermost whorls, resem- 
bling the variety of E. palustre, represented by Dillenius in 
Ray's Synopsis, t. 5.f. 3 ; but the stem is not deeply furrowed, 
as in that figure, which by this character is identified with E. pa- 
lustre. I have seen no such variety of E. limosum in England. 

6. E. hyemale. Greater Rough Horsetail. Shave-

several parts of Yorkshire, Norfolk, and other counties, as well 
as in Scotland. 

Perennial. July, August. 

Root black, variously branched. Stems erect, of a deep glaucous 
green, from one to two feet high, cylindrical, uniformly and ra- 
ther copiously furrowed, the furrows minutely toothed, and of a 
stony hardness. Sheaths tight, rather short, whitish, with a 
circle of black at the top and bottom, and crowned at first with 
a row of black, lanceolate, pointed teeth, which very soon fall 
off, as Willdenow has remarked. Catkin terminal, solitary, at 
first ovate, pointed, and black j subsequently elliptical, abound- 
ing with whitish powdery seeds. 

The stems are generally quite simple, or branched towards the bot- 
tom only J nor have 1 ever seen them so much divided as in 
Gerarde's figure, still less like the cuts indicated, on Bauhin's 
authority, under the variety /3, to which therefore marks of doubt 
are subjoined. 

That eminent chemist Sir Humphry Davy first detected a quan- 
tity of pure silex, or flinty earth, in the furrowed cuticle of this 
plant, which accounts for its power, as a file, in polishing wood, 
ivory, or even brass. This purpose it has long served in En- 
gland, under the name of Dutch Rushes, being usually import- 
ed from Holland. So Wheat Straw, whose cuticle contains the 
same earth in an impalpable state, like others of the natural fa- 
mily of Grasses, see r. 1. 71, is used, when burnt, to give the 
last polish to marble. See Introd. to Botany, ed. 6. 62.

In wet sandy ground in Scotland and Ireland. 

On the sands of Barry, by the sea coast of Angus. Mr. G.Don. At 
Baldogle, near Dublin ; by whom found I have no account. 

Perennial. July — November. 

Whole plant smaller, and much more slender, than the last. The 
crown of the branching creeping root sends up several slender 
stems, seldom a foot high, often much less, either erect or as- 
cending, furrowed and rough like E. hyemale, so that, except 
its smaller size, this species is equally fit for use as a file. The 
sheaths which crown the joints are rather more lax, especially 
the uppermost of all, and their upper half only is black, crowned 
with far more permanent and conspicuous white, lanceolate 
teeth, the lower portion of each sheath being pale, or glaucous. 
Catkin ovate, acute, blacker than in E. hyemale, with a more 
slender stalk. 

The fibres of the root of this curious little species are remarkably 
woolly, like those of Grasses that grow in loose sand.

Common receptacles radical, dispersed, globular, of 4, or 
more, vertical cells, coriaceous, not bursting ; the parti- 
tions membranous, irregular. Anth. almost globular, 
numerous, naked, simple, assembled in the upper half 
of each cell, in nearly sessile groups. Germ, likewise 
numerous, occupying the lower half of the same cell, 
globular, with a conical stigma. Seeds enlarged after im- 
pregnation, numerous, roundish-oblong with a constric- 
tion, filling the whole cavity of the cell, each wrapped in 
a close tunic of mucilage. 

As the bodies which occupy the upper part of the cells 
waste away, those in the lower part gradually swell, 
having the appearance o^ seeds, though Dr. Hooker, with 
all his well-known acuteness of inquiry, could discover 
no traces of organization. I know of no experiments to 
prove their germination, but this may safely be pre- 
sumed from analogy, as the affinity of this genus to 
Ferns and their allies, is presumed, from the involute 
form of its shoots. If the embryo of Cycas bears so very 
small a proportion to its large vitellus, or rather albti-

plant. Dr. Hooker mentions several places in Scotland^where 
it has been observed. 

Perennial. June, July. 

Stems thread-shaped, partly branched, creeping close to the ground, 
and sending down tufts of small, slender, smooth, simple radi- 
cles, so as to cover a space of many inches diameter ; and bear- 
ing larger tufts, of four or five awl-shaped, narrow, smooth, up- 
right leaves, an inch or two long, opposite to each parcel of ra- 
dicles, above. Common receptacles close to the leaves, solitary, 
slightly stalked, globular, blackish, resembling pepper-corns, 
but downy. These were observed by Doody to be " divided 
into four parts," but this seems to refer to their internal 
division, or cells, only, which are usually four, sometimes 
more. The outer coat does not split asunder, except, per- 
haps, when advancing towards decay, when the ripe seeds fill 
the internal cavities, and are whitish, roundish-oblong, with a 
contraction in the middle, and a terminal point, the whole coat- 
ed with a glutinous transparent substance. The insertion of 
the seeds, by their fleshy stalks, into the inside of the hollow 
receptacle, resembles a Fig ; but this, though a singular point 
of agreement, is the only one between these otherwise dissimi- 
lar genera, nor does it indicate any natural affinity.

the centre. 

Fert. Fl. similarly situated, at the bases of the outer /ro??^/^.

numerous, combined 3 together, in little stalked globules, 
externally rough ; each angular at the inner side, convex 
at the outer. 

By analogy only do we thus venture to name the parts of 
fructification; nor has the germination of this curious 
genus, still less its impregnation, ever been verified. The 
very few species known are aquatics, growing, and per- 
fecting seed, entirely under water, at the bottoms of lakes 
or ponds, in Europe or in the East Indies. The roots 
are perennial, tuberous, with many long, stout, hairy 
fbres. Fronds radical, tufted, simple, awlshaped, nearly 
upright, monoecious, bearing the fructification at their 
base, close to the root. Mr. Sowerby thought he found 
two cells in the common receptacles, as delineated in Fngl. 
Bot. Dr. Hooker observed but one, though his figure, 
which is excellent, shows what may account for the mis- 
take, and it is not impossible that the partition of the^h^V, 
to which perhaps the seeds are originally attached, may 
subsequently be obliterated. The whole matter merits 
further inquiry, the impregnation of submersed plants in 
general, especially with separated flowers, being very little 
understood.

In the more shallow parts of the bottoms of clear alpine lakes. 

In most of the lakes of North Wales, Scotland, Cumberland, and

Lhwyd appears to have first remarked it in Britain. 

Perennial. May, June. 

The long, simple, somevirhat hairy, fibres run perpendicularly down 
from the tuberous root into the ground. Each plant, having no 
stem, consists of a tuft of numerous awl shaped /ronds, more or 
less upright, acute, smooth, obtusely quadrangular, all varying 
in height, in different individuals, from three to nine inches. In- 
ternally they are formed of four longitudinal cells, having nu- 
merous transverse partitions. At the base each frond is dilated, 
with a membranous edge bordering the solitary, oval, flattened 
common receptacles above described. Of these that which ripens 
its contents the latest is judged to be the seed-vessel. The seeds 
are pure white, granulated all over, as in the East Indian species, 
whose common receptacle is certainly of but one cell, which, 
alter the seeds fall out, is lined with their permanent stalks. 

The taller, more slender, and brittle variety /3, observed by Dr. 
Richardson, may perhaps be caused by those sudden risings of 
the waters, so frequent in mountainous countries, which will 
account for all the peculiar characters of this variety. Fish are 
said to feed, and grow fat, on the Isoetes,

Several circumstances have caused a long delay In 
the publication of the present volume, which, if 
their recurrence should not be prevented, may ren- 
der the completion of the work, according to its 
original plan, very precarious. In the mean while, 
the number of volumes originally proposed is now 
finished, and the first 23 Classes are completed, as 
well as the first Order of the 24th, Cryptogamia 
Filices, the only one that required more study and 
emendation than it has hitherto received. 

Of the remaining Orders, the Musc'i have been de- 
tailed in the Latin Flora Britannica and Compen- 
dium of the author, as well as in his English Bo- 
tany ; and by other well-known writers, in two 
editions of the Muscologia Britannica, and the 
Muscologies Hibernic(F, Spicilegium, Still this 
beautiful and interesting tribe of plants might prove 
susceptible of much illustration to Enghsh readers, 
and of some improvements relative to generic dis- 
tribution, on principles too little studied by the 
pursuers of superabundant discrimination, instead 
of philosophical combinations. This is the bane 
of natural science at the present day. Hence the 
Jilum Ariadneum is lost, or wilfully thrown away, 
and a bandage darkens the sight of the teacher no 
less than that of the student. 

The monograph of Dr. Hooker on British Junger- 
mannicB, which, with their allies, constitute the 
next Order to the Musci, diffuses a new light over 
the whole of that Order. The works of Mr. Daw- 
son Turner on Fuci, and of Mr. Dillwyn on Con- 
fervas, have gone far to exhaust the species of those 
tribes, an application of scientific principles to the 
settlement of their genera being all that is wanting. 
The Lichen family, under the controul of the great 



[ S46 ] 

Acharius, assumes the dignity of an entire and 
well-arranged Order. The Fungi, better discrimi- 
nated by Withering than by most popular writers, 
and well explained by the figures of the excellent 
and lamented Sowerby, are, in their minutest de- 
tails, exquisitely illustrated by the Cryptogamic 
Flora of the ingenious Dr. Greville, and the accu- 
rate pubUcations of Mr. Purton. These, mar- 
shalled by the aid of the learned Persoon and 
others, might possibly have proved less obscure 
than heretofore. This tribe indeed leads the bo- 
tanist to the end of his clue, and leaves him in pal- 
pable darkness, where even Dillenius was bewil- 
dered. 

All these subjects, if not yet brought into perfect day- 
light, might well, by the help of those brilliant 
northern lights, Acharius, Fries and Agardh, have 
been made more accessible to the student, and 
more instructive to systematic botanists, by one 
long accustomed to their contemplation in the wild 
scenes of Nature, and not unfurnished with remarks 
of his own. If our bodily powers could keep pace 
with our mental acquirements, the student of half 
a century would not shrink from the delightful task 
of being still a teacher ; nor does he resign the 
hope of affording some future assistance to his fel- 
low-labourers, though for the present, "a change 
of study," to use the expression of a great French 
•writer, may be requisite " by way of relaxation and 
repose." 

The student of the Phfenogamic Plants of Britain 
will, it is hoped, find this publication sufficient for 
his purpose. The numerous and very curious ad- 
ditions, received by the author during its progress, 
and announced at the end of the 23rd Class, en- 
courage him to think the subject is far from ex- 
hausted, and to look for still more discoveries to 
enrich his future volumes whenever they may ap- 
pear.
