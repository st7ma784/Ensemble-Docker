thickly set with very small sub-sphferoidal tuberc^les, of a grey 
white colour. Jacq. Crust either blue grey, black or white, or 
rather, the proper crust is black, but this is verj' thin, very 
closely adhering,, not always present, and then its place is some- 
times supplied by the outer grey coat of the tulxTcles spreading 
upon the stone. Tubercles black, but before the crust which

Specimen from Mr. Griffith; growing on Schistus. The 
crust has a pale brown outer coat, which within has a greenish * 
cast, covering a whit^ matter which fonns the principal sub- 
stance of the crust. It is granulated and cracked on the surface ; 
the granulations lar^e, somewhat elevated, and not unlike tu- 
bercles. The fructifications are at first like saucers with a 
brown border; this soon disappears, and they rise up in the 
form of laree black nearly globular tubercles. 

This cunous specimen si»ems to shew that the Lichens con^ 
Jluens, and pilularis are the same plant under somewhat differ- 
ent circumstances of growth. Mr. Griffith also suggests, that^ 
our 4th var. may be the L, pinnatus of Dickson, which I think 
probable, and is, as he observes, the plant in its oldest and 
most weather-beaten state.

In this instance the black colour of the fructifications seems 
to extend itself over the otherwise brown crust. Tubercles .

and the crust greenish underneath, as in the 5th variety.

Mr. Griftith has discovered a further change in this Lichen, 
as curious as it must be unexpected^ and which is sufficient to 
shew that many discoveries yet await our enquiries in this sin- 
gular tribe of plants. I shall transcribe his own words. — " In 
the more advanced state of L. niger small glaucous leaves issue 
from the dark ground, which in time form the imbricated L« 
plumbeus. The dark ground (which is now of a spongy texture,) 
becomes elevated, and forms that cork-like substance which is 
attached to the L. plumbeus.''

When it grows old the saucers become black, and their op-

figure with a groove extending its whole length. In this state 
it is the Spharia sulcata of Bolton, the Lichen pulicaris of Hotf-

near the centre of the plaiit of an olive colour ; very rarely 
found. They are at first concave witli an inflected margin, 
wrinkled, when magnified. They scarcely rise above the thr«ul- 
like branches, bat at length the margins become reflected and 
the saucer more elevated,, assuming the shape of a tubercle 
about the size of a vetch seed. The plant has not the polished 
appearance when in fruit. Mr. Griffith. From the specimens 
before me it would seem that the plant in its younger state it 
quite black and polished, brown black when older, losing its 
polish, dnd when very old bleaching to pale brown and even to 
white. Linn;£us had given the above figure of Dillenius to his 
varietyoftheL. islandicus marked y, bnt Mr. Lightfoot after 
an examination of the original specimen of Dillenius and com* 
paring it with the figure, was decidedly of opinion that Linii4 
had been mistaken, and that it was really the L. pubescens. In 
a finely fruited specimen sent by Mr. Brown the saucers are, 
sometimes edged with prickles like projections, probably the 
origin of young branches ; they are brown black on the surface, 
white and pithy within. Mr. Brown says it always produces 
fructifications on the summit of Locliain in Breadalbane, though 
rarely elsewhere in the Highlands.

Two feet or more in length, branches not much thicker than 
a sewing thread, greenish-white. Not much branched, but 
the number of threads together form a considerable large bush 
or tail. These straight threads send out lateral fibres throughout 
their whole length, either simple or divided, standing outside- 
wise, not pendent. Saucers few, rarely met with, small, flesh- 
coloured. Dill. It is on the authority of Dr. Smith that we 
place this as a var. of L. articulatus, L. harhatus, Linn. &c. 
In both kinds the stem and branches consist of a greenish out-

This plant in its 6rst state consists of a number of fine tender 
membranaceous pellucid green leaves,waved with margins which 
are elevated and bluntly indented. These leaves soon acquire 
a firmer texture, become opake, the upper surface changes 
to a bright green, and the under to a bufi-colour ; lastly they 
turn to a dusky olive ; the elevated margins are bent back, and 
the leaves are coiled like hollow cylinders, and covered with nu- 
merous minute dots, which are the only fructification hitherto 
observed. When moist it has a peculiar smell, not ver unlike 
that of fresh peeled oak bark, Mr. Griffith.

without end : when it grows on moss it is a very large thick* 
leaved gelatinous plant. 1 have found specimens 4 or 5 inches

plentifully on the living main stem of the Juniperus communis 
in the same wet season as the above. Dr. Smithr in E. bot. 
justly observes, that most jmrasitical cryptpjramous pHmts are 
found either upon totally dead trunks or branches, which is the 
case with Fungi or Tremella* in general ; or they are rooted^ 
like the crustaceous Lichens, in decay cil external Uycrs of the 
bark. On the contrary, the T. Sabinrc and T. juniperina 
spring from the lice wood, under the bark of vigorous branches. 
Fron^ these circumstances Dr. Smith infers thpse plants *' to be 
mere gummv exudations, and that the powdery surface was 
ow^ing to resiaous particles, insoluble in water, accompanying 
them." But I have been so fortunate as to find both these

opake and approach to blackness. The outer surface of these 
coats is studded with conical papillse, which probably contain 
the seeds^It is supposed by the country people to oe the re-

that this is of animal origin, but without sufhcient reason^ 
After very severe frost, I have frequently found a gelatinous ♦ 

substance, which from a careless observation might pass for a 
Tremella, but it is the remains of frozen frogs. This substance 
does not shrivel up in dry weather as the Tremella does, nor if 
it plaited and waived; and generally some of the bones of the 
frog may be found in it. After the severe winter of 1789, I 
found great quantities of these on the edges, and in the water 
of ponds.

BS to improve the Essential Character, though confessedly im*.

plants, some of which approach in their habit and jointed struc- 
ture to the Confervas, still more of them resemble the membra- 
naceous or gelatinous Ulvas, whilst the strong and leather-like 
sorts are sufficiently distinct from either. - From what I have 
• seen myself, and from the discoveries of Major Velley and Mr.. 
Stackhouse, I begin to believe that the leather-like Fuci will 
form two distinct Genera, and that the others must be di\'ided 
into three more at least.

Turner, has already undertaken to extricate the confused ge- 
nera of Marine Alga», and to form them into a more perspicu-

There can be little doubt of the Fuci being the food of

manure by the farmers on the sea-coast. The stalk of the F. 
Esculent us may be eaten, as may alt^o the F. saccharinus when 
boiled ; but the more crisp and tender leaves of the Fucus 
lanceolatus^ holosetaceus, and piujiatijidus, are used as a sallad.

All these varieties ate fotind common in our seas, excepting 
the first sort which is mentioned by Linnaeus, but I believe ha$ 
not been fonnd on our coast. 

The structure of the fructifications much resembles that of 
the F. senratus, and the mid-rib dies away where the granula- 
tions begin. 

Boththisand the jp. 5erra<M^ when fully grown, arc forced 
continually by the flux of the tides 'against t)ie rocks, and by 
the constant collision lose the membranaceous part of theit 
lower leaves, while the main stems, which are exceedin^jly 
tough, acquire a smooth roundish form, and the forked ribs 
which pervade the upper leaves, wear away to sharp thorny 
points. In this state both these plants have a shriib4ike ap« 
pearance, whilst the short leaves and inflated vessels at the sumr 
mit of the branches are frequently entire. If the F. vesicuhsus 
receive an injury or fracture, in any part of the leaf, provided 
it be in a healthy vegetating . state, it constantly -throws out 
abundance of young le^jes from the injured p%rt. If even a

rally more or less length ofthe thread-shaped branch continued 
beyond them, but witliout any leafits, divided into blunt seg-

Stack HOUSE. The secondary branches which proceed from the 
main stem resemble a long strap-shaped cartilaginous leaf, irom 
whence originate in a lateral direction the pods, and at the ex- 
tremity of the pod is frecfuently found a continuation of that 
cartilaginous leaf, which appearance seems to favour the opinion 
of Gmelin that the pods are only the leaves in a state of fructi* 
fication; but in examining this plant the pods may be found.

afterwards inversely urceolate, perforated at their apices, con- 
taining a globular mass of roundish seeds. Colour, pale red, 
approaching to that of bricks, less fugitive than that of F* kali"

whitish green. Turn. Hist. Every observer must be aware of 
the great similarity between the characters of this species and

in F, clavellosus the branches and ramuli are never verticillate, 
nor are they marked with those joint-like contractions so appa*

cup full ^ an inch diameter. Out of this arise one or two strap- 
shaped leaves, several feet in length, nearly as broad as a straw^ 
dividing into Dorics at distant intervals. The whole plant i« 
opake, ribless, dark coloured, and in every part beset witli in- 
bercles filled with a slimy fluid, and open at the top. A ))encil 
of hairs issues from some of them, but the fluid they pour out 
contains nothing like seeds; the others without hairs pour out 
a mucilage filled with seeds of an oblong shape, but so small as 
to elude the naked eye. This apparatus of fructification seems 
nearly the same as that in the i\ serrutus, except that in this 
plant the male and female organs are indiscnminately dispersed 
over the whole plant, whilst in that the male flowers are on the 
lower, the female on tlie upper part of the branches. Dr. Bor-

From a large hollow bulb arises generally one, sometimes 2

the middle, thinner at the edges, where it is strangely furbelow- 
ed and contorted. This stem, which is upwards of 2 feet long, 
suddenly expands into a very wide head, which divides into 
sword-shaped segments. Its substance is leather-like, totally 
free froifi veins or fibres ; colour deep brown, and appearing as 
if varnished. The bulb sends out numerous strong horny roots 
, which strike deep into the ooze, or lay hold of the stones in the 
larger crevices of the rocks. Stackhouse. Ner. Brit, The 
roots are conical, serpentine, and well represented in the fig. of 
Mr. Stackhouse. Great masses of these roots are frequently 
thrown upon the shore, and Mr. Stackhouse infonns me that 
the plant sometimes weighs 20 or 30 pounds, or more. TJie 
ft-uctification consists of many dot^ or globules dispersed through 
the whole of the foliage, within its substance. Mr. Stackhouse 
informs me that he has also found -vesicles under the surface 
containing reticulated jelly like those in the F. digitatus.

Leaves arising many in succession, of different sizes, from a 
discoid base. It is as thick as leather, large, veinless, trans- 
parent. From a flat discoid base arise 2, 3 to 8. or more leaves 
of different sizes, and of different ages, the largest are from 6 
to 9 inches high, on a thick compressed, or nearly cylindrical 
stem. This stem suddwily dilates into a very wide, smooth, 
leather-like leaf, sometimes 4. or 5 inches over near the top, in 
shape like the lateral section of a wedge. When in fruit, the 
middle of the leaf, betwixt the two coats is a vascular jelly, the 
* " vessels are annular tubes chained together. The sur&ce at 

this time rises into conical protuberances perforated at the 
top. 

* After being soaked in fresh water, it is eaten either boiled, or dried^ and

perfectly pellucid. It arises from a flat knobby base, of a 
c*onsiderable size, extending to the height of 6 inches. Ft is 
forked in its mode of growth, the segments from 1 to 1-|- inch 
broad, of the same breadth from one subdivision to another. 
The ends are subdivided into several strap-shaped segments 
about the breadth of a straw, -|" *^ ^'^^^^ long, and blunt or 
notched at the extremities. 

The fructifications appear in every part of the plant, ex- 
cept the terminating segments. They assume the shape of ob- 
long spots, placed at pretty regular intervals, of a darker 
colour than the rest of the ])lant. These spots under tlie 
microscope, are found to consist of dark red granules, or 
globules ; smooth and without any fruit-stalk.

to the F. holosetaceus, but has no appearance of bristles on lii

as in a Conferva. They consist of reticulated membranes with 
here and there shining glassy threads, beaded with air bubbles 
as in the air bladder of F. nodosus^ and no duubt for the pur- 
pose of inflation. The fructitication is principally towards the 
top of the plant, and consists of clusters of seeds infinitely 
smaller than those of the F. vesiculosus, adhering to the inside 
coat or swimming in its fructiferous jelly which is not formed 
into net-work, though evidently vascular. There are no vi- 
sible openings to allow the escape of the seeds, but the plant 
decays at top when ripe, and the seam opens. I have seen it 
17 feet long, or more ; it is only brittle when drj-. Mr. Stack-

extremely distinct, as is the case with one now before me sent

several of them appear^ replete with opake substances. On . 
making a lonj^itudinal incision into these, I clearly discovered, 
by the help of* cj moderate magnitier, the form and direction of 
these vessels which proceeded from a point,or kind of puncture 
in the inner side of the membrane. They evidently grew ia 
a conical shape, and resem1>led a Peziza. The tops of these 
Peziza-form vessels were regularly dilated and somewhat pro- 
minent, covered with small dark globular grains. Differs from 
the F,fastigiatus sind fur cellatus, in being le»s branched than

from the F, rotundus of Gmelin ; for besides the forks being 
acute in the r^otundus^ the fructiH cations grow in excrescences 
on various parts of the stem ; and ibr this last reason among 
others, it cannot be the F. augulatus of that author. Mr.

that Gmelin and Lightfoot have been mistaken about the blunt

follow that these are shoots which have not yet put forth the 
istrap-spear-shaped fructification : but if they are right, Mr. 
Woodward's conjecture will be confirmed.

Plant about 6 inches^ high, of a fine grass-green, sometimes 
inclining to olive. Stem short, roundish, hollow. Branches 
nearly all of a size, which is that oi a small quill. When taken 
fresh from the sea and viewed in a bason of water, it has the 
appearance of a sponge ; when a little drained it has a most 
beautiful soft, velvety appearance. When examined with a 
powerful microscope it appears to be a collection of tubes set in 
a stiff, solid membrane, without the least resemblance to the 
fructification of a Fucus, so that 1 expect it must form a new 
genus. Stackhouse.

several of them appearM replete with opake substances. On . 
making a longitudinal incision into these, I clearly discovered, 
by the help of 4 moderate magnitier, the form and direction of 
these vessels which proceeded from a point,or kind of puncture 
in the inner side of the membrane. They evidently grew in 
a conical sViape, and resemliled a Peziza. The tops of these 
Peziza-form vessels were regularly dilated and somewhat pro- 
minent, covered with small dark globular grains. Differs from 
the l\fastigiatus and fur celiatus^ in being less branched than 
eitJier ot them, but particularly in the forked extremities of the 
latter constantly originating in acute angles. It differs also 
from the F. rotnndus of Gmelin ; for besides the forks being 
acute in the r,otundns, the fructiti cations grow in excrescences 
on various parts of the stem ; and lor this last reason among 
others, it cannot be the F. angulaius of that author. Mr. 
Hudson has named this plant t' e F. tuOerculutus, but as several 
other Fuci put on tvherculated appea'ances in maturity, 1 have 
in conformity to its ti.aracter, aiid mode of growth, called it

admirable figures of Mr. Stackhouse and Major Velley fully 
illustrate Mr. Woodward's observation. If we may suppose 
that Gmelin and Lightfoot have been mistaken about the blunt 
ends of the branches pouring out a prolific mucus, then it will 
follow that these are shoots which have not yet put forth the 
strap-spear-shaped fructification : but if they are right, Mr. 
Woodward's conjecture will be confirmed.

long, cylindrical, nearly the eighth of an inch in diameter, ter- 
minating obtusely. It consists of a diaphanous membrane re- 
plete with a clear gelatinous substance. Inner surface of this 
membrane interspersed on every part with innumerable minute 
specks, which at first give the whole plant the beautiful hue of 
the almond blo8ii«>m ; but as the gelatitious substance diminishes, 
these granulated substances attain a kind of orange colour, and 
from the outer hne mem brane collapsing upon them they become 
more distinct, appearing almost as if fixed on the outer surfiace. 
Broken Laver. Found not unfrequently at low water, on the 
beach at Weymouth * but I never coul4 discover any root upon 
the various specimens I have examined. As they^ adhere 
closely together, and are very tender, they are probably broken 
by the flux of the sea, and torn oil* from their base. Specimen

Resembles a worm in its writhing form, size, and mucilagi- 
nous nature. It rises from a thick, blunted base, like glue, 
fixed in the interstices of the rocks. It is generally simple, 
sometimes a little branched toward the middle of the plant, 
sometimes 5 or 6 grow together, in which case they are pro- 
portionally reduced in size, which in the largest seldom exceeds 
that of a goose quill ; from 4 t^J inches long blunt at the end. 
Colour resembling, but sometimes lighter than that of glue. 
It is soft, and consists of a fine membrane which on its internal 
surface seems crowded with extremely minute, o))ake, granulated 
bodies. If cut horizontally into very thin lamina, these grains 
appear fixed in a clear gelatinous substance which constitutes . 
the interior body of the plant, and they seem to occupy about 
one third part of its surface in a circular direction, leaving the 
middle part perfectly clear, through the centre of which a dark 
parenchymous line passes, from one extremity to the other. 

Fucus elminthoides, Bot. arr. ed. ii. Grows in abundance

This non-descript Ulva was sent me by Majot Vellcy, with 
the following description* It is a large plant ; the lower part 
of the main sten^ consists of a lubricous sign which in the se- 
condary branches becomes gradually finer till those branches ter- 
minate in minute ramifications composed of granulated vessels 
pointing two ways. It is not improbable that the globules in 
these branches may be the 'isource of proliferous vegetation, for 
numerous slender shoots may be observed %o pullulate from them. 
Major Velley. The fructificidions are n^ore regularly dis- 
yposed than is usual in this genus, and its fine branches and pink 
colour give it a good deal of the »ppeairance of the Conferva

C. equisetifoUa. This has been named from its mode of growrth 
resembling some of the Equiseta. It is from 3 to 5 inches 
high, of a red clay»colour. The jointed mid-rib is sur- 
rounded by whirls of short filaments, but these being 
longer than the joints it is entirely covered by them.

few, forked, uikl-rib jointed, whirls of filaments not 
longer than the joints, and not so thick set as in the pre- 
ceding, so that the mid-rib is sufficiently visible. In the 
older plants .these tilaments become white and opake.

always in very small q^^ntity. The peculiarity of its habit 
brings it near to Fucus Wiggkii B,iid makes it one of the many 
links that unite the two genera. It is usually about 3 inches high . 
Its small solid root sends forth many cylindrical pale yellow 
stems, pinnated from their very origin, w\th short, opposite, dis, 
tichous, horizontal shoots, in general simple, sometimes extend- 
ing into new branches ; joints cylindrical ; septa darker, and

sometimes 5 or 6 inches high. When young it is composed of 
very pale green transparent fibres ; as it approaches towards 
maturity the septa appear more distinct, the joints become more 
rounded, and replete with a scarlet liquor which in a short time 
oozes through the tender skin, but it shews its joints very dis- 
tinctly even after the discharge of this liquor. A very singu- 
' lar instance of irritability appeared in this plant upon immers- 
ing it when quite fresh, into fresh water. Af^er it had been in 
the water a few minutes, several fibres were observed to move 
in an horizontal direction with a quick convulsive twitch, then 
to stop suddenly. This they continued to do for some length 
of time. , I repeated this experiment several times, and the same 
effect was produced, provided the plant was fresh. At first I 
attributed it to a separation of air from between the joints of 
the Conferva, but this ought to have been seen when rising up

The figure of Dillenius is by no means characteristic. This is 
evidently distinct from Conf. corallina, the joints much more 
slender, and not thick at the ends. It difiers also from that in 
producing short lateral thorn-like substances. Fructifications in 
globular clusters on short lateral pedicles ; rarely found. It may 
readily be known by the intolerable odour which it imparts when 
xecent. Major Velley. Its beautiful crimson colour is owing 
to a liquid in the cavity of the joints which may be pushed to 
either end of the joint but not beyond the septum. On cutting

only a matter formed of the particles of aquatic plants dissolved

Conferva, perhaps the C. bullosa. Observing a pond in the 
state of flowering, as the country people term it, I examuied 
some of the water, but the particles floating in it were so mi- 
nute that even with the assistance of a very good microscope, / 
J[ could not satisfy myself as to their figure or structure. Two 
or 3 weeks later in the spring I found threads, not jointed, not 
branched, either straight or coiled up like a cork-screw. Some 
of this water kept in a glass jar, alter 2 or 3 weeks more let its 
contents subside, and then it began to appear like a Cdnferva,

Of a rieh tawny yellow, which colour it retains when dried. 
When fully grown about 2 inches high, growing in tufts. Eaph 
fibre is divisible into other fibres, but they are all finely feather- 
ed from the base upwards. The ends appear more solid, of a 
chesnut colour, and not unlike anthers. When examined in the 
microscope, these chesnut coloured tips all resemble one another, 
and appear very different from the rest of the plant. They are 
filled with granules, and are hispid with bristle-shaped tubes 
pointing upwards. See PI. 18. f. 5. 6, a single tip magnified. 
This is the whole that I have yet been able to discover of 
the fructification. We may either suppose the tip to be a cap- 
sule, the granules it contains the seeds, and the bristle-shaped 
tubes the pistils ; or else that the Granules are Germens, and 
each of the tubes a case of Anthers. 

This plant, whose perfect state of growth seems to open / 
the way to a discovery of the fructification of the Genus was 
observed by the Right Hon. Lady Elizabeth Noel, growing 
upon an old elm chair which received the drippings from a 
water cistern ; and I am indebted to the kind attentions of her 
Ladyship for fine specimens in the highest state of perfection. 

The Byssus barbata when fully grown resembles this species 
in colour and in height, but that is marked by transverse lines 
shewing the growth of each year, similar to what we see in 
the tubes of the perennial Boleti, and the stems split at the 
ends into a number of capillary fibres.

perfectly, but their colour in a great degree. This discovery was made ac-

when held iti the hand, as Hallerhas observed. The pUeus ha» 
sometimes a little mouse-colour in its centre, and so has thestem 
iu the larger plants towards the bottom. It dries when old, 
and then turns wholly of a brownish colour. Mr. Stackhouse 
once found, and figured one specimen with a ring on the stem. 

It is sometimes very minute. Stem not \ inch high, and a 
pileus not larger than the head of a pin. Baron Haller, Miche- 
lius, and others, are inaccurate in describing this species as5/ri- 
ated. That character, strictly speaking, ought to imply cer- 
tain streaks or marks inherent in the pileus, whereas the striae 
which they allude to, are nothing more than the edges of the 
gills appearing plainly through.

It does not appear by Mr. Bolton's figure or description 
whether the gills are fixed to a collar, or to the stem, but be 
that as it may, ours is certainly the plant of M. BuUiard, 
quoted above, though he says the stem is solid, and calls it the 
Ag, androsaceus of Linnaeus, but that is a very different plant, 
and had he given a dissected drawing,he would not have found 
the stem solid. The. gills are carelessly done both by Schaeffer 
and Bolton, and in the latter the dimple in the centre of the 
pileus is not expressed. The plant at first is entirely white, 
but it dries, remains a long time, and gradually changes its co- 
lour to a yellow brown, the stem becoming quite black.

the hollow stem at its top supplying the place of a pileus, and

This, and its varieties,, have very generally been supposed 
by the Englrbh botanists to be the Ag. piperatus. Linn — who 
led them into the error, by quoting Haller and Bauhine for 
synonyms to his piperatus ; synonyms which undoubtedly be- 
long to the species described by Dr. Lister, but by no means ac- 
cording with the Swedish plant. To avoid perpetuating this 
confusion, I have rejected the trivial name piperatus ; though 
applied to it by J. Bauhine, who seems first to have given a 
good description of it. «/. B. hist. ;ii. p. 825. cap. G. Dr. Lister 
seems first to have found it in England. His description, partly 
copied from J. Bauhine, may be found in Ray. cat. p. 123, and 
also in Ray. hist. p. 88^ c. 9. The doctor observes that the juice 
j» mostly poured out by the external parts of the plant, that it 
did not change the suiface of polished steel, that it became 
green when dried, but still retaining its acrid biting quality. 
He observed too that the plant was much eaten by insects and 
snails. Ray Syn. 4. 14.

This Agaric is by no means uncommon ^ith us, and if it 
grow in other parts, it is matter of surprise that it should hav6 
remained unnoticed so long. It imparts a fragrant odour like 
that of new mown hay. Its colour approached nearly to our 
general notion of a stone colour, and does not vary throughout 
the different parts of the plant. The transparency of the pileus 
• shewing the form of the Gills through its surface, it might be 
called striated, as well as other fieshless Agarics ; but this dis« 
tinction, when it does not arise from colour, or some peculiar 
structure of the pileus itself, is with more propriety . omitted. 
Major Velley. 

Gills slightly decurrent, not very numerous, ^or-4 in a set. 
Pileus dead brown, white, smooth, gently convex but rather 

dimpled in the centre, becoming hollow with age but not

Stem' solid, fibrous, cylindrical, dead brown white, 2 to 2 ^ 

inches high, thick as a crow or a goose quill. 
The Pileus is not always so transparent as to shew the gills 
through it. The cupping of the pileus as the plant grows old 
tears the gills near the place of their attachment to the stem. It 
smells like hawthorn in blossom, and its scent is so strong that 
it may be perceived at a considerable distance even before you 
see the plant.

This differs very little from the preceding, but from being 
Jess crowded in jts growth assumes a more perfect form. By 
,the more full exjjaiision of the pileus some of the long gills sepa- 
rate from the .stem, which causes the appearance of 8 in a set in 
,those parts ; and indeed iu this species, the extent of the decur- 
rence of the long gills,is very variable. The discharge of the

be facilitated by the present disposition, and further observa-

to lessen the usual distance between it and the stem. 
These gills are more irregular than those of any other 
Agaric I have examined, ifor they are much branched at 
bolh ends, and these branches inosculate with one ano»- 
ther so as to form a net work, not only upon the stem, 
but also under the edge of the pileus.

Ag* coniiguus ; knowing however that those plants most abound»- 
ing with milk are sometimes . without it, as I have particu* 
iarly found in the Ag^ xerampelinuSf I think it very possible 
^that a niore favourable concurrence of circumstances may teach 
xis that it is really a milky species. .

This plant rises out of the ground inclosed within its brown 
studded wrapper. /'Fb/va of some authors, but not of Linn.) 
A section made vertically shews' all the parts in their original 
position, and also the curtain (the real Volva of Linn.) whiph 
remains long after, forming when torn by the expansion of the 
pileus, the broad ring upon the stem described above. The 
warts upon the pileus are fragments of the wrapper, a fact 
which I was for a time indisposed to credit, because they often 
adhere so strongly to the pileus as not to separate without tear- 
iiig up its skin. Mr. Stackhouse justly observes that the warts 
being undoubtedly the remains of the wrapper, the same spe- 
cies may be sometimes smooth and sometimes warty, and 
that this circumstance cannot constitute even permanent va* 
rieties.

This Agaric is very tough and strong, with a considerable 
share of elasticity. Mr. Stackhouse observes that the edge of 
the pileus coops in like the button of a common mushroom, that 
the gills are numerous, stiff, and white, that it is often fouiid 
not in clusters, and that in many instances it Approaches the 
Ag. crassipes. To this opinion I perfectly agree, and further 
remark, that the tendency to a ribbed stem in some of the spe- 
cimens still increases the affinity ; but until the Ag» crassipes 
shall be better known, especially in its younger and smaller ' ' 

forms, I think the difficulties will sooner be cleared up by keep- 
ing them apart. The want of a boss on the pileus, the absence of 
cracks in its skin, the want of strongly marked ribs on the stem, 
and more than all, the tough elastic substance of the plant, 
prevent me at present from arranging it as a variety of the eras- 
sipes.

The pileus not woolly in the centre, but patched with rem-

woolliness mentioned in the preceding varieties is owing to rem- 
nants from the same origin.

This is a very common Agaric, and one of the most beauti-

* The gills in most of Schaeffer's plates of this plant, are erroneonsly

but in the fig. ihey are of two different lengths, except only in pi. 92. f. 2. 
The same may be said of pi. 93, 94, where they are described as equal, but 
figured of two or even three different lengths. 1 don't know that these varie- 
ties,' viz. Scliieff. 93; 94, have yel been seen in England.

Lmn. which is a very difierent plant to this of Schseffer ; but as 
the character Linnaeus gives to his viscidus could never lead 
Mr. Hudson to this plant of Schaeffer, I must suppose that he 
had found the latter to be the plant before him j and only erred

in referring it to the species of Linnaeus. Mr. Hudson likewise 
refers to Scop. 1477, but Scopoli refers his species, which he 
cbMs purpurascens, to Fl. Suec. 1232, and these seem also to be ' 
Schaeifer's plant. The real A^« riscidus of Linnaeus has lately

markable, seems to have been overlooked. Probably the dark 
blunt blotches upon the pileus may have caused it to be con- 
founded with the Ag. adustus, before mentioned, or with the 
Ag. elephantinus. The difference however of structure has sa- 
tisfied me that it is not the former species. Major Velley very 
justly remarked to me, that the viscid Agarics are much dis- 
posed to shew dark tints. This plant cannot be the Ag. visci-

Pileus convex, very irregular, sometimes peaked, brown buff, 
more or less white at the edge, 1 to 1^ inch over. Flesh 
thin. 

Stem solid, pithy, yellowish white, rarely straight, often eccen- 
tric, 1 to 1^ inch high, thick as a small goose quill. In 
clusters, often united both at top and bottom, the pileus 
seldom regular firom this cause. The plant has a sweet- 
ish, hawthorn-like, but nauseous and fainty smell, 
vin its very young state the gills seem loose, but as 
the stem advances in growth, part of the central flesh 
of the pileus seems to elongate to form the upper 
part of the stem, and then they are evidently ^xed^ to 
the stem.

Ray Sj/n. p. 3. n. 13, has been referred to for this plant, and 
also for the Ag. violaceus of Linn, but though the general de- 
scription perfectly accords with this species, yet the white gills, 
which are repeatedly mentioned, satisfy me that-it is a plant dif- 
ferent from this as well as from the violaceus, which it in no 
respect resembles, except merely in the colour of the stem. 
Major Velley justly remarks, that this plant of Dillenius agrees 
with 2398 of Haller, who refers toSchsetf. 38 ; a plant not now 
known to exist in England, but probably it will not much lon- 
ger escape the observation of our botanists. 

Ag, bulbosus, 11. Angl. is I believe the plant before me, Mr. 
Hudson has been censured for making this a species different 
from the violaceus of Linn, but I am satisfied that he has done 
right, and that his character is sufficient to discriminate them. 
He does not say, «« lamellis cteruleis,'* but " carulescentibus,** 
by which I imagine that he means they attain this colour in the 
progress of growth only, and are not originally so. His " stipes 
brevis,** is very expressive, and his character of the pileus is 
pretty exact. Had he referred to Schaeff. 53, instead of 34, 
which is the violaceus, his readers would have understood him 
l>etter, and his reference to Ray has only served to increase the 
misunderstanding. <Thisison€of the Agarics which, as well

tain like a cobweb, its fragments sometimes left hanging 
to the edee of the pileus. 
This species diffei*s very tnuch in size, as well as in its- tints. 
In an jidvanced state the pilens loses its lilac colour and assumes 
a russet hue, yet the gills continue with little or no change of 
colour. Here I must remark, that a more pennanent criterion, 
as to colour, may be looked for in the gills, than in any other 
part of the Agarics in general. Major Velley. 

Pileus large, circular, slightly convex, colour various, from 
the deepest purple to a rusty brown. Gills of a beautiful pale 
purple, unequal lengths. Stem short, thick, solid, swelling

served, thcit in maturity it emits a plentiful powder of the colour

It is remarkable that when the green viscid mucilage i« 
scraped off the pileus, or wears off in its more advanced age, 
the real colour appears, which is nearly that of copper. Also 
that the gills are white when their cover of purple paint is re- 
moved. The whole skin of the pileus easily strips off and shews 
the white flesh underneath.

See Schaeffer, p. 65, chiefly taken from CI us. hist. 273, where 
the reader will find seveml other curious circumstances respect** 
ing it. But 1 am pretty well satisfied that these authors have 
mistaken the species, and that the above accounts ought to be 
transferred to the Ag. deliciosus, which is still as highly esteem- 
ed in modern Italy as it was in ancient Rome. The Ag. xeram- 
pelinus is eatable, but it has a strong heavy earthy taste, and 
is not at all agreeable. 

This plant must be very rare in this country, as it is unno- 
ticed by any of our botanists. It was first' found by my daugh- 
ter in the Red Rock plantations at Edgbapton, several growing 
together of different ages and sizes, in a dry' soil, where either a 
larch or a fir tree had been cut down 4 ydars before. A few- 
days afterwards we found it again in company with Mr- Stack- 
house, but none of our specimens were found with either cur- 
tain or ring. The specimens first gathered afforded a milky 
juice in greater abundance than I had ever seen in any oth^ 
spec\es, but these the next day shewed no signs of milk, neither 
were those gathered a few days afterwards on the same spot, at 
all lactescent. This first taught me that that circumstmnce 
could not be relied on as a specific distinction. It is described and 
figured by Clusius as havi ng been involved in a wrapper or volva, 
when young and aboilt the size and shape of an eg«^. Tne cur- 
tain, and its remains on the stem in form of a broad permanent 
ring, are also noticed by the authors referred to above, so that 
notwithstanding the defect of these parts in our specimens, there 
can be no doubt of their existence in others,

This is one of those Agarics which possesses all the parts 
belonging to the Genus, and being on a larger scale, is well fit- 
ted for instructing the learner to understand them. In its em- * :/ 
bryo state it is enclosed in a wrapper, and is equal in size to a 
large pullet's egg. if this be cut through vertically, the section 
brings to view tue gills, the pileus, the stem as yet imperfectly 
formed, and the curtain extending from the stem to the edge of 
the pilens, the remnants of which in a more advanced state of ^'* 
growth, are sometimes observable fringing the edge of the pi- 
lens, and always forming a broad rin^ round the upi>er part of 
the stem. A good drawing of it in its egg-state may be seen 
in Bulliard, pi. ^G4, A. — Also see our plate 19. -^

but the plants are the same. Bulliard's plate 232 
agrees, except that the pileus is described as downy, 
and the stem is longitudinally striated ; but as from its 
woody substance it shrinks and somewhat twists in dry- 
ing, this appearance in the figure may be occasioned 
by that circumstance, Mr. Woodward.

Mr. Woodwafd observes that this variety is found in groves ; 
that the stem retains its usual colour and toughness.. He say^ 
also that this species has a mti'ch higher flavour than the com- 
mon mushroom, but probably frcjm its lesathery nature is indi- 
gestible, except in the form of powder, in which it is admirable. 
I havp seen the. pileus and. gjlls pf this Agaric* very brittle 
' dhd tender when fully saturated wi^ moisture in iraiiny seasons, 
and in that ststte it is suftciently digestible. It is not, as Mr.

that it is used in ragouts, that its flavour is equal to that of th# 
true MoQcerouy but that it is more tough. 

I am satisfied that the bare aud brown, or highly cloathed 
and verdant circles, in pasture fields, called Fairy Rings, ate 
caused by the growth of this Agaric. We have many of them 
in Edgbaston Park, on the side of a field sloping to the South 
West, of various sizes ; but the largest, which is 18 feet diame« 
ter, and about as many inches broad in the periphery where 
the Aeries grow, has existed for some years on the slope of an 
adjoinmg pasture field, facing the South. The soil is thin, on 
a gravelly bottom. The larger circles are seldom compleat. The 
large one just now described Vsmore than a semi-circle, but this 
phenomenon is not strictly limited to a circular figure. Where 
the ring is brown and almost bare, upon digging up the soil to 
the depth of about 2 inches, the spawn of the Fungus will bie 
found, of a greyish white colour, but where the grass has a^ain 
 * grown green and rank, I never found any of the spawn existmg. 
A similar mode of growth takes place in some of the crustaceuf 
Lichens, particularly in the L. ceritrifngus. 

As this Agaric may be procured plentifully, and as its fine 
flavour will probably soon introduce it to our tables, particu- 
larly in catsups and in powder, forms in which its toughness is 
no objection to its use ; I imagine it may be of some conse- 

Suence to guard against errors in those who gather it, or in 
bose who direct it gathered ^ and as much confuaon and many 
^ mistakes have hitherto existed amongst authors on the subjciict 

of this very common plant, I shall now, in addition to the parti« 
, cular description given of it above, subjoin a list of the figures 

erroneously quotd as representing it, pointing out wlmrein 
they differ from it. 

Ag. mouceron. Bull. 142. This is very unlike our plant, k 
has a very thick and fleshy jpileus, its gills are extreme- 
ly narrow and numerous, and its stem is thick and short 
Not to mention that the gills top are fixed to the stem. 

Ag. lucocephalus. Bull. 428. 1. This is a much larger plant, 
has a fixed gill, a mudi thicker, and a brittle stem, but 
the toughness of the stem in our plant is such as is nearly 

. alone sufficient to distinguish it.

Jig. eoUinus. SchsefF. 220. This has a hollow stem, otherwise 
it is not much unlike it ; but the stem is too thick for 
our plant, and the boss uypon the |>ileus is very peculiar* 

Ag.niveus, SchsefF. 232. Diners very widely indeed, having 
a pileus concave in the centre, a hollow stem, and a very 
decurrent gill. 

Ag. prtealtus. Fl. dan. 830. 1. This figure has some general 
resemblance, and the decurrent gills may be only appa- 
rently so from the turning up of the pileus ii| the ad« 
vanred age of the plant. The author however refers to 
Battar. p. 46. t. 21. fig. F. and we here find that this is 
a very large species indeed, well agreeing with the trivial 
name praaltuSy but the figure gives no such idea. 
I have referred to Ray Syn. p. 6. n. 27, for our plant, biit a 

very respectable authority has lately given this species of Ray 
, to the Ag, sordidus. I confess that the short character ffiven 

by Mr. Ray is so imperfect as to admit of various applicatiODSr^ 

though his usual sagacity did not desert him when he mention^ 
. ed its leathery texture. But this alone would not have bi^xi 

sufiicient. Fortunately he subjoins an English name, Stotch 
' boHnets, from which, those who are intimately acquainted with 

the habit of the fairy-ring Agaric, will immediately ackbow*

This species I believe was first found in England about 3 
years ago, by Mr. Knapp, who then sent me an account of it, 
observing that it gave a greasy appearance to the paper in which 
he had preserved it. On making further enquiries concerning 
it, he &voured me in March last with a drawing made from 
his dried specimen, and also the following observations — Gills 
white. Pi/eu5 nearly flat, of a nut colour, with an extremely 
fine woolliness. Stem tawny, rather scored, not hollow. Mr. 
Knapp. — I imagine it is a rare plant, as Mr. Knapp has not 
found it since, tnough its size and the length of its stem, as well 
as the elegance of its appearance, render it sufficiently observ- 
able. A single specimen was gathered in this neighbourhood, 
and brought to me this morning.

Mr. Stackhouse had repeatedly mentioned to me a large es- 
culent Agaric found on the sea^oast in Cornwall, which is, I 
believe, a monstrous variety of this species.. Its whole habit is 
very large, the button as big asra potatoe, the expanded pileus 
18 inches over, the stem as thick as a man's wrist, the gills 
very pale ; the curtain as tough and as thick as a piece of lea- 
ther, the juiee yellowish ; the flavour iijferior to that of the 
Ag. campestris. And he has very lately informed me that it , 
corresponds with the decription of J. B, hist. iii. p. 824, cited 
by Linnaeus under Ag. Georgii. It was probably a plant of 
this kind, which was mentioned to me by a gentleman of un- 
doubted veracity, as having been gathered some years ago on 
an old hot-bed in a garden in Birmingham, and weighed 14 
pounds.

they were nearly white even for some time after the tearing 
of the curtain so as to make me doubtful of its species, but 
at length they changed to the usual colour. This delay was 
probably occasioned by the slow ripening of the seeds so )*♦«,

Major Velley. I am oblig^ to the gentleman just 
mentioned for the knowledge of this plant being indige- 
nous, for most of the preceding characters, and for the 
following observations:-— The pileus is so little fleshy, 
that when dry, it is sufficiently transparent to exhibit the 
form of the gills. The decurrenc*e of the longer gills, 
which is invariable, separates it from the Ag. coriaceus 
of Lightfoot, (Ag. orcades) the gills of which, as he 
observes, do not touch the stem. It is much less fleshy 
than the Ag* ebumeus. It cannot be liay Syn. p. 7.

approach and seem united in pain, but as their attach* 
ment to the pileus is at some distance from each other,

Ther^ is some doubt whethet we are right in considering 
this species as the same with the clypeatus of Linneeus. He 
says the gills ate white, but then the circumstance of their 
being dusted with a dark-coloured powder may give them the 
colour we have described. He refers to Haller enwn, 41. 
35, where Haller describes them as very white ; in every other 
respect his description applies exactly to our plant, and be re« 
fin's at 2388 of his Hist, Helv. to the same figures which we 
have found to correspond with ours.— This in many respects re- 
sembles the i^^. vari«#, but the elastic firm atid wiry stem of

This, though one of our most common, and when in perfec-

one. In a fine summer mominff it is covered with a bloom like 
that ou a plumb, frequently witn a glittering spangled appear- 
ance, which, aided by the re^larity of its form and the delicate 
fringe of the curtain, make it an object which the eye contem- 
plates with pleasure. When gathered, the top of the stem is 
apt to bend at a right angle^ so that the apex of the cone points 
horizontally. The bloom soon vanishes, and the whole turns 
black in decay. In its general habit and the firmness of its^ 
•tern, it approaches the Ag. varius.

Sometimes on cow-dung, and when protected by long grass 
the stem is covered with a white hoariness, which readily rubs 
off, and the remains of the curtain forms a beautiful festoon 
round the edge of the pileus. When very young the gills are 
brown, but they soon change to dark and become mottled.

These plants are semi-transparent, tender and brittle. I 
think Mr. BuUiard mistakes in saying the gills are loose y they 
only become so when the pileus turns up as tne plant approaches 
its decay, and then they are torn from the stem. His reference 
to Schaeffer, t. 75, is certainly erroneous, for that is Ag. integer.

Mr. Bolton thinks this the same as his pi. 63, and saya be 
finds no distinction between them except in colour. If so, the 
dissections have been made carelessly, for the gills in this are 
drawn remarkably distant from the ' stem, whilst in pi. 4, and 

El. 63, they are drawn o& fixed to the stem. Perhaps however 
e is right, and the dissected figure may have been drawn from 
f iMj^f^ ft weak or decaying state, when the gills* may have 
vj^patod firom the stem. I suspect that the whole plant 
in a diseased stale.

The Ag. aurantius is the strongest exception I have met 
with to the present mode of arranging the genus. The last two 
varieties undoubtedly belong to the aurantius,many of the plates 
of which will give a good idea of them, if the colours, and the 
circumstances of the gills were changed. Perhaps the gills in 
an earlier stage of growth may be found attached to the stem ; 
and as to colour, this species is unusually sportive. To prevent 
embarrassment I shall introduce them as exceptions to the ge- 
neral distribution ; and what system exists without its excep- 
tions. On further examination I am satisfied that the gills are 
all fixed to the stem, thougb in some of the varieties only by a

"mealy. Pileus convex^ border bent in. Stem scored towards the top; 
<< growing in clusters.*'-^My opinion f swell supported by the following re- 
marks of Major Velley : ** Schaeffer is of opinion that his Ag. pnttacinus and 
Ag* coccinetti, t. SOI — and d02, are both described by Linncus under the 
trivial name dentatus. If this is the fact, has not the great naturalist formed 
his specific character with less precision than usual, since there are other 
Agarics more obviously dentated than the above, particularly than the cocci" 
neus 302, which in Sch^effer's table does not shew the indented character ? I 
have frequently found the Ag. coccineus of Schaeffer, but do not recollect to 
have observed the teeth, and if they were observable, in an Agaric so remark- 
able in its colour and habit, they might have been noticed in the general de- 
scription of the plant, wbik its more obyioug distinctions should have furnish- 
ed its trivial name."

This is with us a very rare species, and my opportunitiea of 
examining it have been msufficient to allow me to clear up some 
difficulties which present themselves on inspecting the figures 
and descriptions of authors. 1 beg therefore to be understood as 
speaking with great uncertainty, and wish it may challeng^e the 
attention of those botanists who have had better opportunities of 
examining it. I have two sorts of shaggy Agarics now before 
me, the one just now described, gathered at Edgbaston, and 
other sort sent from Herefordshire by Mr. Stackhouse. The first 
sort has a regular fine hollow in the stem, and fixed gills, the 
second has a solid stem and decurrent gills. The habit and 
general appearance are the same in both, but these essential dif^ 
ferences in structure require them to be kept apart. Schaeff. 61. 
is a very exact representation of the plants found here, and 
Schaeff. 80. agrees well with the Herefordshire plant. Schaeffer 
was aware that they were not the same plants, and has attempted, 
though not unsuccessfully, to point out some discriminating dif- 
ferences. Curtis 264, and Bull. 266, agree with the Edgbaston 
plant in structure, but they are both much larger, and the. 
colour of the gills is too dark in M. Bulliard's plate. The 
Herefordshire plant has been extremely well drawi^ by Mr. Stack- 
house; it is also indifferently figured Fl. dan. 491, of a small 
size. For what morel know respecting it see Ag. pilosus.

Curtain very pale yellow, fugacious, leaving no durable

In the larger and more expanded plants some of the long gills 
separate from the stem ; and then they cease to grow, for tney 
appear less broad than those which remain attached to it. This 
circumstance however compels us to count 8 in a set. 

Gills very closely set and in maturity changing from a yel-

distinguishes it.

Gills loose, pale, unequal, mostly 4 in a set, long ones some- 
times cloven: they are loosiB from the stem, but fixed to 
a fleshy ring underneath the pileus. 
Pileus bluntly cWical, dark brown at the top, paler towards 

the edge, scored, smooth, opake, 1| inch over. 
Stem hollow, black, shining, straight, firm, 4 to 6 inches high. 
Root crooked, thick, knotty, sunk about an inch into the 
earth, and always attached to rotten wood. Always solitary. 
Has a strong offensive garlic smell, which it retains for days 
afler it has been gathered. Linnaeus supposed it to be a variety 
of his Ag. campanulatus. Jacquin. 

- Ag, alliaceus, Jacq. but not of Bulliard, for that has a stem 
hairy on the outside and solid within. 

Mr. Relhan found this plant in woods and shady places at- 
tached to rotten wood, and oak leaves, particularly in Mading- 
ley Plantations. It has lately been found also in woods about

This beautiful but fugacious plant has been extrciiiely well 
figured by the authors cited above, but our best English bota- 
nists have fallen into an error in supposing it to oe the Ag^ ^ 
Gmetarius of Linnseus, as will be evident to those who will take 
the trouble to compare the figures or the descriptions. That ' 
has wfiite gills, changing to bl^ck, this fio^ pi|ik or rose red ;. ^ 
that is egg-shaped, this cylindripal ; that grows on dunghills, 
this in open pasture land. 

A young plant put into ixrater and covered with a glass bdl, 

frew three inches and a quarter in twelve hours. In decay jt 
eliquesces in form of a dark-coloured fluid hanging in dr6ps 
onthe gills< The outer white coat of the pileus is sometimes so 
thin as to allow the innct* pinky colour to appear throagh it, es- 
pecially towards the bottom of the pil^us.^

537, f^^7n£ to represent specimens of this andidso of the 
Ag. quercinus. 

Gills in the younger plant 4 in a set, light brown, sometimes 

branched. 
PiLEUs thin, when young fixed to the wood on which it grows, 
the gills being uppermost ; it then separates from the 
wood and turns up, as is more particularly explained in 
speaking of the Ag. quercinus. This, now upper part, 
is brown, or greenish, and woolly, consisting of concent 
trie circles formed in ridges. It is apt to contain bkides 
of grass, or bits of sticks, perforating its substance, 
which onl)'^ could have happened in its soft state. 
Stem none. Rather leathery than fleshy : belts variable, some 
more woolly. 
Gills firm^ seldom inosculating. Linn. Pileus always vil- 
lose, and marked with concentric circles. Gilh irregular, var 
riously branched, but not forming lacunae as in the Ag". 
quercinus. BuUiard 394 belongs to this species, and probably 
Schaeff. 57. It has been confounded with the Ag. quercinus, by 
supposing it to be that species in its young state. Mr. Wood- 
ward. Lobes elliptical, tiled, from 1 to 2 inches over, chesnut 
brown, in shades with concentric wavy circles, very velvety to 
the touch, of a woody substance. Gills shallow, whitish, thick* 
ish, rigid, not emitting seeds when lying upon paper. In its 
young state it is gelatinous li^e a Boletus. Mi*. Stackhouse. 
^ This species has been involved in much confusion, chiefly arising 

from its different appearance at diiferent ages, Mr. Stackhouse 
sent me a young plant in its gelatinous state, which accorded, 
as he observed, with Fl. dan. 776. 1 ; the pileus being white and 
the gills a ricli deep saffron colour. Bulliard 346, the lower 
ligurcs, seem the sHme plant when it has just attained its firm 
texture ; the colour of the gills darker and more of a purple 
cast. The other figures represent; the plant in its older states, 
and of very different sizes, the colour of the gills being then a 
reddish brown, and the pileus somewhat paler but with wavy 
(circular streaks of a darker hue. The figures in Bulliard 394 
are very exact representations of the specimens now before me. 
It sometimes grows to the size of one's hand, enlarging by pro- 
liferous olFscts from the edges, each offset having its own proper 
central point to which its gills are directed ; but in this case the 
gills in the centre of the aggregate plant become extremely con- 
voluted and irregularly branched.

 Mr. Bolton, who has accurately attended to the economy of 
this plant, observes that in its first stage of growth the gills are 
uppermost, they are then distinct, and branched, their sides 
united by minute lateral projections. In its second stage the 
pileus is in part detached from the substance on which it grew.

the detached part rises up to an horizontal position, increiisinf^ 
iu size, while the other part remains fixed, serving as a support 
to it. As it grows older, the lateral projections of the gills in- 
crease in size, and filling up the interstices between the jgiils 
give them the appearance of oblong pores. Mr. Bulliara in 
plate 442 has given us several varieties of this very singular 
plant, and Schaeffer2dl is one of monstrous or unusual growtti. 
Mr. Woodward observes that the union of the gills formmg la- 
cunse, leaves it doubtful whether it should be placed with the 
Agai ics or the Boleti. Mr. Stackhouse Mays that the pileus may 
be said to consist only of fructification, as it cannot be separated 
from the old wood without taking with it the part it adheres 
to: he also agrees with Mr. Bulliard that it sometimes appears 
so much like a Boletus as to occasion a doubt to which genus it 
should be referred. He further remarks, that in some of the 
thick, and to appearance solid specimens, the pileus is not 
thicker than a shilling, that the gill is a thick leather}^ sub« 
stance, little resembling the gill of an Agaric, and that it is the 
link which connects the Agaiics with the Boleti. Ray Syn.

to gain a good idea of the structure of this very singu- 
lar plant. When grown to a good size it looks exactly 
like a piece of beeve's liver, lu the different figures 
cited above the under surface appears of very dinerent 
colours, which Mr. BuUiard attributes to the presence or 
absence of pink coloured roses which close up the mouths 
of the tubes, but are detached before the seeds are poured 
out. This may in part account for the change, but it 
may be observed that th^ tubes themselves are also of 
different colours, vife. green, and brown red. Bull. 464,

forming the green tubed, and the others the red tubed 
species or variety. Not having had sufficient opportuni- 
ties of examining the plants in a recent state, I mention 
these circumstances in hopes that others who more fre- 
quently meet with them, will attend to them at differ- 
ent ages, iand determine the mutter. The figure of Mi- 
cheli is excellent, and the structure of the tubes did not 
escape his penetrating eye, as appears by the dissected 
figures at tne bottom. He remarks that the pileus is 
rusty red, the flesh blood red, the tubes dirty dull yellow, 
bordered at the mouth. Mich. p. 119. This plant at- 
tains its growth in a few days, and is of short duration^ 
Bull* Lobes elliptical^ generally issuing from a short 
^ stem. In infancy it is viscid, pulpy, and exsuding on 
being pricked ft bloody water : colour deep red. When 
mature the upper side gets rough and hairy, and turns 
blackish red or deep chocolate. The under side does not 
assume the form of pores till a late period. It appears 
at first cream coloured, and is studded very beautiiiilly 
with pear-Goloured pimples, interspersed with some of a 
blood red. 
The pores and tubes are extremely minute, being like so 
many needles huddled together, nor is the aperture of the tubes 
very discetnible without being magnified. They are hardly i 
an inch deep. The flesh of the plant now appears dry and 
string. Mr. Stackhousb.

SchoefFerin pi. 121, has figured another plant with a smooth

ovinus. On account of the uncertainty of their identity, 1 have 
thought it better to give it a new name; to say nothing of the 
futility of the old one. This species is subject to be over-run 
by the white and the yellow Reticularia of BuUiard. Schaef-

This species, though not uncommon, has been the occasion 
of great confusion, partly because it had never been well figured 
before the 60th plate of M. Bulliard appeared, aad partly from 
the Linnaean character holding forth the inequality of the pores 
as its n^ost prominent feature. It is true, the [jores appear very 
much like a piece of sponge, both in colour and shape, and 
admit of great variety in t^ize and figure, especially as we find 
sets of tubes together, opening with small pores, surrounded by 
other longer tubes, which Linnseus.calls compound pores. This 
is a striking eircumstance, but as it likewise exists in several 
•other of the larger Boletiin their fully expanded state, instead 
•of aidi nor the discrimination it has promoted the confusion of 
the Sfiecies. Not less than ten of the plates of Schoeffer have 
been first and last given to this plant, though none of them re* 
present it except 103, and 104, which are varieties, and 134, 
^nd 135, which may also be varieties, but it does not appear 
that they are known as British plants.

the plants are represented as growing in great masses, and cup- 
ping up. These grew in vaults upon hewn timber. Mr. Bol- 
ton found his on dry decayed boughs of hazle. In the course 
of time the whole plant assumes a woody texture, harder than 
cork, as is the case with a specimen sent me by Mr. Gough of 
Kendal, which grew upon the rotten branch of a plumb tree. 
The pores in this specimen form eleven concentric circles, one 
laid against the other ; and it is probable that each circle is 
the growlji of a year. The pileus, or the part by which it wag 
attached, does not shew any marks of a regular increase.

the pores have a deeper shade of colour. It however is more

AURICULA'RIA. Flat, membranaceous, fixed 
by its whole under side, but becoming de- 
tached and turning up with age. Seeds 
discharged slowly from what was the upper, 
but is now, in its state of maturity, the un- 
der surface. 

Obs. These plants when young lie flat and are closely attach-* 
ed to the substance on which they grow, the upper surface being 
smooth, but the under surface snaggy with hairs which serve the.N 
pur[iose of radical fibres, ^fter some time the attachment 
formed by these fibres loosens, and the plant turns up more or 
less, but remains stlU attached in some one part, either central 
or lateral. The smooth upper side is now become the under one; 
and from this the seeds are discharged. The fibrous surface, 
pow uppermost, continues shaggy or woolly, often becomes 
striked or zoned in concentric stripes, and frequently assumes 
a variety of colours. A process similar to this takes pli^ce in 
some of the stemless Agarics and Boleti. See Ag. quercinus 
and Bol. versicolor.

This plant was first shewn to me by Mr. Norris, who found 
it growing on sandy banks upon a heath near Bromham. It has 
« hard woody root or knot, from whence it expands in the shape 
of a fan, to the extent of ^ of an inch. The substance is hard 
and stiff when dry, but readily imbibes moisture and instantly 
becomes as soft and pliable as wetted glove leather. The upper 
surface is much puckered and knotted, the under side marked 
with woody nerves radiating from the root, but rather laid upon 
the surface than imbedded in the substance. The plant is of a 
dull reddish brown, the woody nerves very dark brown. Id 
time it becomes reversed, and the ends and smaller branches of 
the nerves detaching themselves fvom the foliage appear like 
bristles. 

Further observatioi^ are wanted on its younger state. It 
will probably prove to be a new species. Mr. Norris says it is 
a perennial, and continues long unaltered.

represented by M. Bulliard are much larger than those of Mr.

Shaped like a butter-boat. Mr. Stackhouse. This plant i» 
most excellently figured by Bolton. The colour is usually a 
bright deep orange above, and a dirty orange or yellow beneath, 
in which it differs from Bolt. 104, which is always a rich scar- 
let within, and white and silvery without. It differs also in 
being irregular in shape, never cup-shaped, except when very 
young, whilst the other is always exactly cup-shaped, and 
stands on a short pedicle. Whether Mr. Hudson's cyathoide 
be the elegant and very uncommon plant figured by Bolton 104, 
seems doubtful, neither Dillenius's fig. nor short description in 
the Synopsis at all elucidate the matter, and it certainly can 
never be called yellow. The first of these is rather scarce, but 
the other is very common on decayed sticks under hedges in the 
spring. Mr. Bolton is certainly mistaken in asserting that hi* 
104 never emits anjr powder from its internal sur&ce, for I have 
repeatedly by a slight irritation, caused the mature plants t^ 
throw out clouds of amoke. It ought, therefore, accordin|^

Mr. Bolton considers it as an Helvella, because it emits its 
seeds in form of smoke or powder when irritated, but the 
Pezizas possess the same property. The real difference between 
them is, that in the Helvella the seeds are ejected from the un- 
der, in the Peziza from the upper surface, as is well pointed out 
by M. BuLLiARD. — P. cerea, 44. Bull, and Helvella visicu-

Though this plant is so intolerably foetid that it is much 
oftener smelt than seen, yet in its egg state it has no offensiTe 
smell. The odour resides in the green matter which fills the 
cells of the pileus, and is very soon devoured by flies, particu- 
larly by the large blue flesh fly. In its egg-state it is about the 
size of a small pullet's egg, and remain^ many days before it 
bursts through its wrapper ; but this bein^ done, the stem 
pushes up with amazing rapidity, attaining tne height of 4 or 
5 inches m a few hours. This oflensive green matter contains 
the seeds, which may be seen by the assistance of a good mi- 
croscope. Such as have courage to smell this matter closely, will 
find it much less disagreeable than at a distance ; for it then 
iieems to have a slight pungency like that of volatile salts. Its 
'^ cdour very soon pervades a whole house. The wrapper is lined 
with a clear jelly like the white of an egg, but stifter ; within 
this is found the green matter, and within that the young plant. 
When it shoots up, the wrapper and the clear jelly remain at 
the root : the stem is hollow; within porous and spongy like 
pith.

I am indebted for the knowledge of this plant to Mr. Wood- 
ward, and also for the following observations :; — Willdeuow 
calls the Lycoperdon on which this grows, L. scabrum, and says , 

it differs from theTuberci barium, which it certainly does, but 
I do not see that it differs in any respect from our T. cervi- 
num. This plant is never branched, though frequently growing 
in clusters, in one instance as many as seven together. Root 
consisting of many lon^, wiry, brown fibres, with which it en- 
' twines and covers the surface of the Taler. but never penetrates 
its substance. Stem slender, about 1 inch long. Head oval, 
about i inch high, covered with minute Sphaeri'se. It differs 
from Cl. digitata, in size, in standing on the Uem, and in bein^ 
unbranched; and from Cl. cupressiformis in having a longer 
stem, an oval head, and the spherules much more minute ; and 
from both in its peculiar habit, and the long fibres which form 
the root. Found on a heath near Norwich some years since,

ler, and after him Lightfoot, very properly divided them ; for ' 
want, however, of attending to the circumstance of the indivi- 
duals being solid, or hollow, a circumstance which seems inva- 
riable, some confusion yet remained. We have now arranged^ 
them,'guided by their structure, and as they naturally fall under 
two species, the third species of Haller and Lightfoot, <^Ued 
vermicuiarisy and its varieties, associates with one or other of 
these two. In this disposition of these subjects 1 am happy to 
have the concurrence of Mr. Woodward, whose accuracy and 
industry have added so greatly to the value of this work, and 
who had, without any previous knowledge of my intention, ar- 
ranged the plants in question nearly as they now stand.

The figure of Schseffer represents the tubercles very .imper- 
fectly, but they are mentioned in the description. Bull.^496. 1 ; 
^ves a good idea of the tubercles, but that has a stem support* 
ing a h^id, and therefoFe belongs to the preceding sub-division. 

The circumstance of the tubercles appearing on every part of 
the plant is sufficient to distinguish this species from all others 
allied to it.

Edgbaston, growing on the- ground.' ' Aug.

Whether this be a viuiety of the preceding, or a distinct 
species, seems doubtful. The principal difierence is that in the 
Clavaria coralloides tlie whole plant issues out of one thick and 
solid stem, which afterwards divide; and sub-divides into yerj^ 
numerous branches ; but in this species they seem ver}' slightly, 
if at all, connected at the base, where the distinct stems are 
much attenuated, and are either simple or slightly branched, 
and lopped at the top. From these circumstances it may be 
thought to approach the Cla\tiria pistillaris, but I should con- 
sider it as distinct froib both. Vaill. 8. 4. probably belones to 
this as Bolton supposes. Mr. Woodward. Branches thickest 
upwards, lopped and fiat at the ends. Yellow, white, or purple, 
full 1 to 3 ii^hes high, and thick as a crow or a raven quill. 
Bolt. LioATF. Scbjeff. It is evident from the inspection of 
the various figures, that some have been drawn, as Bolt. 1 12. 2. 
from plants in a young state. When something older, pointed 
teeth shoot oiit from tlie ends, and when older still these become 
larger and sometimes branched, so that the latter part of the 
linnaean character, included in a parenthesis, would be better 
omitted. Perhaps M. BuUiard is right in considering the fasti* 
giata as only a flat-topped variety of the coralloides.

This differs from both the preceding in having thp extremi" 
ties of the branches sharply pointed, but it agrees with the fas^ 
tigiata in being nearly diiftinct at the base, and with the corals 
loides m being much branched. Mr, Woodward. Yellow or 
brown yellow, from 2 to 5 inches high, branches like some of 
the shrubby Lichens, the branches always aflecting forked divi- 
sions, and terminating in pointed forks. Am not quite certain

The Clavaria Hypoxylon, and di^tata, run so much into 
one anotlier, thaft I do not see how it is pontble to establish 
them as distinct species, but have at present kept them separate 
in compliance wiUi the opinions of Linnaeus, Haller, Hudson* 
Ughtfoot, BuHiardy &c/ 

^ The Rev. Mr. IXckenson lately mentioned to me some CU'- 
rious observations made by Dr. Waller upon these species, which 
seem decisive; The Dr. says that the plants described by lin- 
nseus under the names of Clavaria hypoxylon, Clav. digitata, 
and Clav. ophio(;;lostoides are but one and tlie same plant, which 
he proposes to call Clavaria villbsa. The Clav. hypoxylon as 
described by linnseus is the most common appearance of the 
MalS plant. The Clav. digitata is the most common appear- 
ance of the Female plant ; tmd the Clav. ophioglossoides is only 
a variety of the f(^ale. 

With regard to the Clav. digiiata, so called by Linn, and 
pliiced by him amonest the branched Clavarias, Dr. Waller 
observes that LinU^^us nas been mistaken in his application of 
the word digitatuii >> hy Toumeforf, Vaillant, and others, the 
word has been applied to two female varieties of the plant, not 
to si^ni^ that tn^ were branched, hut because their single 
head iu figure and size bore a resemblance to a ffiiger. 

The Clav. digitatfi, or female plant, begins to spring at the 
same time, (about the end of September) and m the sam^ 
place, (in shady woods) with the male : but grows only to about 
half its height. Though they grow always in clusters upon 
the stumps of the same tree, yet they never both proceed from 
the same root. After the male plant has shed its pollen in 
November, it continues to decay till spring, when it withers 
quite away ; whereas the female continues to grow vigorously 
till about the middle of April, when the head, the seeds in it 
being ripe, bursts in several places and falb off. 

These facts sufficiently shew the distinction between the 
^exes.

which do not appear till the thick brittle coat (which is common 
tp this and the other stellated species) dries or peels off, are very 
numerous, woody, thread or strap shaped. In one specimen

The rays of the wrapper when fully expanded seldom exceed 
1{ inch, though 1 have found them twice that size. They are 
nearly equal, and regu^rly spear-shaped. Outer Qoat of a Dri<>ht 
silvery white ; inner coat much thinner than in any other specie, 
and does not ci-ack and flake oif, but soon dries, when it ac- 
quires a chesnut colour ; smooth, rather shining, /{eoJ com-

conical, ciliated. Segments of the wrapper when dry entirely 
enclosing the head, when moist expanding and perfectly flat. 
It may be made to undergo these changes at pleasure by putting 
it in a saucer with a very little water, when in an hour or two 
it will expand and again contract if suffered to dry. This pro- 
perty it retains for years if kept in a dry place. Plants of the 
Lycoperdon stellatum often appear stemless, but in a few days 
they invariably shew the footstalk. The diameter of the ex- 
panded rays varies ftom 1 to 4 inches, and the size of the head 
from that of a pea to an inch iu diameter. Woodward.

&ce. The pileus is an inch or more firom tlie edge to the apeXi 
and nearly as much in diameter at its base. Phu. Tmns. v. 74»

Humphreys, and afterwards its progress in its various states wa 
carefully watched by Mr. Stone and Mr. Woodward, the latter 
of whom sent an accurate description of it with a drawing to 
the Royal Society, In the Phil. Trans, it is referr^ to the ge-

* coats of the wrapper had induced me to rank it as a Phallus; 
but in truth it is neither a Phallus nor a Lycoperdon, but a koft 
of connecting link between the two, and must probably form a 
new GcBiis. Its wrapper is said to be three-fold, and coo- 
tipues rooted in the ground, but the stem, as it rises up, cgrries 
up almost the whole of the internal powdery wrapper attached 
to its. top, as also some portions of the two outer ones ton 
away from their bases in the same manner. Smith's spiceki*

This elegant little plant was sent to me by the Rev. Mr. Wood, 
of Leeds, in the year 1784. It grows in clusters upon other 
plants ; one cluster of those I received was attached to a stem 
of grass, and another to a piece of a Hypnum. The stent is

I wafj lorig doubtful under what genus this ou^ht to be placed. 
It rents oj»en infliscriminately, which excludes it from the 
Lyco; eriloiis, and in its want of evident woojly fibres or mem- 
brtmes it appears to differ from the Reticularia, and the powder 
not being black excludes it from the Fuligo of llaller. But in 
the larger Sj.»eci mens and in its more advanced stages of growth, 
the woolly lihres become sufticientiy evident. 1 have always 
found it upon cloven oak rails. It is generally egj^-shaped,but 
flatted on the si»le next the rail, to which it adheres by a large 
surface, without any evident loot. Jt is from the size of a large 
pea to that of a Spanish ch.esnut. Its colour, brown, or reddish 
brown lilce a chesnut, but this latter colour only appears where 
it loses its outer skin, wliioh is silvery grey. The surface is 
smooih and sriining, the whole substance very light, and the 
coats ve y thin and b.ittle. The j owder is of a reddish browo 
colour, and so extremely fine, that ihe most powerful microscope 
is necessary to shew that its comjOnent particles are egg-shaped. 
When rubbed upon the hand it prevents its being wet though 
imme.sed in water. 

'J his extraordinary plant grows on decayed stumps of wood, 
rails, &c. and at first oozes out a white froth, which, in time, 
becomes more dense, varying greatly in shape and colour.

• Tliis consists of numerous oblong white streaks, raised above 
the surface of the bark on which they grow. They are about 
l-3d of an inch long, scarcely the 20th of an inch broad. 
They open on the upper side at a kind of seam which extends 
the whole length of the plant, and are tilled with a downy 
matter. 

Discovered and drawrj by Mr. Stackhouse, who found it on 
the green bark of the willow, near to the bottom, where it lies

This always grows on decayed wood ; is of a smooth uniform

forms a smooth, thin, shining coat, instead of the scales which 
compose the outer coat of the latter. At first it resembles thick 
cream, or the running of cream cheese. Mr. Woodward.

The reader is indebted to Mr. Stackhouse for the Mlowins 
history of this remarkable plant, the circumstances of which 
there is reason to believe also apply to the Retic. septica. 

Its first appearance is like custard spilt upon the grass or 
leaves. This soon becomes frothy, and then contracts round 
the blades of grass or leaves in the form of little tubercles 
united together. On examining it in its different stages under 
the microscope, it first appeared like a cluster of bubbles irre- 
gularly shaped, and melting into one another. In the second 
stage it appeared imbricated or tiled with open celk, the edges 
I of the cells beautifully waved. A blackish powdery matter on 

the surface of the cells now gives the plant a greyish cast. In 

the third sta^e the wavy imbrication disappears, and the plant 

settles into minute tubercles united together. Some of these 

. i ' are closed, but many appear as if torn open, and out of the ca- 

' vity emerge little downy strings with irregular shaped termi- 

I nations, and other similar irregular bodies on the same strinss* 

like the heads of some of the genus Mucor, but nothing oi a 
network, from whence Bulliard has denominated the genus. 
i It seems nearly allied, in its last stage, to the Lycoperdons, 

and is not very unlike the Retic. Lycoperdon, as figured by 
Bulliard.

• In an ingenious paper in the Linn. Tr. Vol. 5. the Rev. W. Eirby bis 
endeavoured to throw additional light on this interesting subject, and seems 
to have proved the different kinds of blights to be principally occasioned by 
several minute, parasitical Fungi, and that the evil may be greatly eradi- 
cated by subjecting the seed to proper dressings, as washipg with spritiff

CRYPTOGAMIA. FUNGI. Sphaeria. (1) With a stem. ^^^ 

Obs. This genus has been much enlarged, in consequence of 
the attention lately bestowed on the minuter Fungi, but I can- 
not consent to arrange any of the Clay aria under it, for 
though the discoveries of Micheli and some later botanists,^ 
have «hewn in some species of Clavaria an agreement in the 
structure of the capsules with those of the Sphaeria, yet Schmidel 
has demonstrated a similar structure in still other species of 
Clavaria, and it most probably prevails in all, so that the two 
Genera must on this ground be melted into one, notwithstand- 
ing the very striking differences in other respects. Indeed if 
this principle were allowed, it is probable that many of the 
Lichens must also be brought into the same Genus, nor is it 
easy to say where the confusion would end. Under this Genus 
V several plants are placed which I am aware do not very well 
accord with their situation, but as our knowledge is not yet 
sufficient to enable us to strike out an unexceptionaole arrange* 
ment of them, it is perhaps better to submit to the present in- 
convenience, than to increase the confusion by a premature 
attempt at reformation. Mr. BuUiard has divided the Sphseria 
of Haller into two Genera, viz. Hypoxylon and Variolaria ; his 
genus Sphaerocarpus also contains one or two species, which some 
vwould think might associate with the Sphserias. But though 
I have not adopted Mr. Bulliard's method, for reasons just now 
assigned, yet I am persuaded that something like it will soon 
be tnought necessary.

The place of this plant in a system is not easily determined, 
Th^ capstile opens horizontally about its middle like a snuff- 
box, or like the S. yess. of the Anagallis; the upper add under 
lid remaining entire ; therefore it does not i^ree ¥^lh the genus 
Lycoperdon which opens only at the top^ nor does it well ac- 
cord with the Trichia, the capsules of which stretch so as to«let 
seeds escape between the fibres, though in some species the 
lower part suffers no such separation of its fibres^ niore nearly 
resembling the plant in question.

associate with it. The structure of it is clearly a membr^De 
surrounding, and inclosing the capsule in form of a round ball 
at the top of the stem, which, when ripe, is exploded to some 
distance. This membrane is not fugacious like the Mucors ; a 
specimen, now 6 or 7 years old, still shews the renmius of the 
collapsed membrane, though the capsules are fallen into powder 
and gone. Stem, after the explosion of the head loses its bel-
