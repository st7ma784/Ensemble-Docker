PREFACE. 



From the attention which has long been paid to the eluci- 
dation of the Flora of Britain and the numerous excellent 
otanists who have, since the time of the .justly celebrated 
i.ay (not to go further back), employed their talents upon 
an endeavour to determine the indigenous products of these 
kingdoms, the Author, in common it is believed with most 
English botanists, did not suppose that much remained to 
oe done in British botany ; for he could not expect that 
after the labours of such men as Smith, Hooker, Lindley, 
and others, and the publication of so invaluable and un- 
rivalled a collection of figures as is contained in the English 
Botany, there could still be many questions concerning the 
nomenclature, or any considerable number of unascertained 
species, the determination of which would fall to his lot. 
He had not however advanced far in the critical examina- 
tion of our native plants before he found that a careful 
comparison of indigenous specimens with the works of emi- 
nent continental authors, and with plants obtained from 
other parts of Europe, must necessarily be made, for it 
appeared that in very many cases the nomenclature em- 
ployed in England was different from that used in other 
countries, that often plants considered as varieties here were 
held to be distinct species abroad, that several of our spe- 
cies were only looked upon as varieties by them, and also 
that the mode of grouping into genera was frequently es- 
sentially different. 

The discovery of these facts produced considerable asto- 
nishment, and the author was led to consider what could 
have been the causes of so remarkable a discrepancy. The 
following appears to be the most probable explanation. 
It is well known that at the close of the last century Sir 
J. E. Smith became the fortunate possessor of the Her- 
barium of Linnaeus, and was thus enabled to ascertain, with 
very considerable accuracy, the British species which were 
known to that distinguished man, and to publish, in the

most improved form that he had given to his system, a re- 
markably complete and excellent Flora of Britain. Then 
followed the long-continued separation of this country from 
France, and indeed from most of the European nations, by 
which we were almost completely prevented from obser- 
ving the progress which botanical science was making in 
other countries, and at the same time our own flora was 
continually receiving accessions of new plants which it was 
nearly impossible to identify with the species detected and 
published in France and Germany. At the conclusion of 
the War we had become so wedded to the system of Lin- 
naeus, and it may even perhaps be allowable to add, so well 
satisfied with our own proficiency, that, with the honour- 
able exception of Mr. Brown, there was at that time scarcely 
a botanist in Britain who took any interest or paid the 
least attention to the classification by Natural Orders which 
had been adopted in France, and to the more minute and 
accurate examination of plants which was caused by the 
employment of that philosophical arrangement. Let it not 
however be supposed that the author wishes at all to de- 
tract from the value of the Linnaean system â€” a system 
which was considered by its author as merely a provisional 
arrangement or kind of index to the known plants ; for no 
botanist has more strongly stated the value of a natural 
classification than Linnaeus himself, â€” as he fully believes 
that without some such artificial scheme by which newly 
discovered plants could be catalogued for easy reference, 
the multitudinous species which distant countries have sup- 
plied would long since have formed so enormous and con- 
fused a mass as to have reduced botany to a state little 
better than that into which it had fallen at the commence- 
ment of the Linnaean era. 

The publication of so complete and valuable a Linnaean 
work as the English Flora greatly contributed to the per- 
manency of this feeling, and accordingly we find that at a 
very recent period working English botanists were unac- 
quainted with any of the more modern continental floras, 
and indeed even now many of those works are only known 
by name to the great mass of the cultivators of British 
botany. 

In the present work it has been the Author's endeavour 
to adopt in all cases those names which have the claim of 
priority, unless good cause could be shown for a contrary

proceeding, and with this object he lias carefully examined 
nearly all the best European Floras, comparing our plants 
with the descriptions contained in them, and in very many 
cases with foreign specimens of undoubted authenticity. 
In the adoption of genera and species an endeavour has 
been made, by the examination of the plants themselves, to 
determine what are to be considered as truly distinct, thus, 
it is hoped, taking Nature as a guide, and not depending 
upon the authority of any name, however distinguished. 
Still let it not be supposed that any claim is made to pecu- 
liar accuracy, nor that the Author considers himself qualified 
to dictate to any student of botany, for he is well aware 
that there are many points upon which persons who have 
carefully studied the subject may form different conclusions 
from those to which he has been led. 

The present volume being intended to form a field-book 
or travelling companion for botanists, it was advisable to 
restrict the space allotted to each species as much as pos- 
sible, and accordingly it will be found that the characters 
and observations are only such as appeared to be necessary 
for their accurate discrimination. Synonyms have been 
almost wholly omitted, but at least one British and one 
German figure of each plant is quoted in all cases in which 
it could be done with accuracy. Localities are only given 
for new or peculiarly rare plants, the existence of so com- 
plete a work as Mr. Watson's New Botanist's Guide having 
made it unnecessary inconveniently to swell the present 
volume by their introduction ; but in order to convey some 
idea of the distribution of plants throughout the United 
Kingdom, the letters E, S, and I have been appended to 
the descriptions of such species as are only found in 
England, Scotland, or Ireland respectively, â€” all plants 
without such an addition having been observed in each of 
them. An O has been appended to a very few plants 
which only occur in the Channel Islands, or which, although 
included in our lists, there is reason to suppose have never 
been really detected in Britain, thus pointing out that they 
have little or no right to be considered as natives or even 
denizens. The descriptions of a considerable number of 
doubtful species which have been added to our Flora by 
previous writers, or which, although decidedly naturalized, 
have very slender claims to be considered as aboriginal 
natives, are included within [ ] , and notices of a few plants

concerning which more accurate information is requisite 
are distinguished in a similar manner. A very concise 
Synopsis of the genera, according to the Linnasan method, 
is given for the convenience of those botanists who may 
not be quite familiar with the Natural Orders. 

Dr. Lindley's valuable Introduction to the Nat. Syst. of 
Botany being accessible to nearly all the readers of this 
little work, it has not been considered advisable to intro- 
duce detailed descriptions of the Orders ; but in the pre- 
paration of the short distinctive characters the author has 
availed himself of that work, of Dr. Arnott's elaborate 
treatise contained in the Encyclop. Britan. (ed. *J. vol. v. 
pp. 30-141 ), of Endlichers Genera Plantarum and Koch's 
Synopsis Flora Germanicce. To the latter work, which 
may be considered as the model of the present publication, 
he has pleasure in acknowledging himself to be peculiarly 
indebted, and Leighton's excellent Flora of Shropshire has 
supplied much valuable information. 

To his friends Prof. Balfour of Glasgow and D. Moore, 
Esq. of the Glasneven Botanical Garden at Dublin, he is 
under very great obligation for their kindness in supplying 
him with complete Catalogues of the Floras of Scotland 
and Ireland respectively ; and to them, to W. Borrer, Esq., 
E. Forster, Esq., Prof. Henslow, the Rev. W. A. Leighton, 
and his other botanical friends and correspondents too 
numerous to record here, he takes this opportunity of re- 
turning most sincere thanks for the great assistance that 
they have rendered to him by the communication of valu- 
able suggestions, observations, and specimens. 

It is hoped that those who use this book will favour the 
author with information of any (even the slightest) addi- 
tion, correction or alteration that may appear to be neces- 
sary, in order that it may be employed in the preparation 
of a future edition, as it is only through such assistance 
that the Flora of an extensive country can attain to even a 
moderate degree of perfection.

points (which I fear are not constant) my British specimens 
agree better with G. germanica than G. Amarella, which possesses, 
according to that author, obtuse calyx lobes, a cylindrical tube 
to the corolla, and sessile capsules. He refers to both plants as 
being natives of Britain. Reichenbach adds as a character of 
G. gei-manica revolute margins of the calyx-segments. It appears 
to me that these 2 and also G. obtusifolia (Willd.) form only one

genus in the Phyt. Nos. 15, 16, 17, 23, and the Rev. J. B. Bri- 
chan's excellent paper in No. 18. of the same Journal. It seems 
highly probable that a different arrangement of the genus will be 
the result of a more careful study of the living plants, as, to my 
mind, the present specific distinctions are far from being satis- 
factory.
