PREFACE. 



If utility has generally been allowed to those 
Works in various branches of science, which, with- 
out aiming at critical investigation, tend to direct 
the Traveller in the path of hb researches, it will. 
We trust, scarely be denied to a similar attempt in that 
particular department, where, more than in all others, 

the time and labor of the student are employed in 
seeking after the means of prosecuting his studies^ 

and where it not unfrequently happens that the merely 
meeting with the objeft in view is in itself the ulti« 
mate end and reward proposed. Under this impres- 
sion it is hoped, that, at a period when pursuits in 
Natural History become almost daily more prevalent^ 
the present work will not be deemed an unacceptable 
offering to the Public; and if, by removing some

of those difficulties which discourage the beginner^ 
or by affording to the experienced Botanist the 
means of more successfully prosecuting his inquiries, 
it tend to promote the study of that interesting and 
amusing science, we (ball have attained to the extent 
of our wishes ; for, though we have found by expe* 
rience that in ienui est labor ^ we are well aware that 
the remainder of this sentence cannot be applicable 
'to a work, the very nature of which precludes all 
display of knowledge or investigation, and forbids 
us to look for credit beyond that of careful and 
industrious compilers. 

Hence, however, arises the advantage that ^r 

responsibility, as authors, is confined to the mere 
circumstance of having faithfully copied and properly 

arranged, the materials before us, a task we have 
endeavoured to fulfil with as much accuracy as can 
fairly be expe£ted in a work of this nature. There 
are indeed some errors, which must be regarded as 
inseparable from our undertaking, and for which it 
19 particularly necessary to deprecate the severity 
of critical censure. We have found it impossible to 



?AfiFACfi«. Ul 

avoid mistakes respecting the names of places^ the 
orthography of which is in many instances so littk 
settled, that they have frequently been differently 
written by our different correspondents; nor hav« 
we known where to apply for an infallible standardf 
the most perfect Index Villaris having afforded us com- 
paratively but trifling assistance. We h^ve therefore in 
this, as well as in almost every other instance, endea* 
voured strictly to xon&ne ourselves to the task of 
copyist and have scarcely ever ventured intentionally 
to deviate from the examples w^ have received, even 
though they have involved the necessity of spelling in 
more than one manner names which we had reason to 
believe were intended to be the same. A second, and 
considerable source of error, lies in the places of 
growth being sometimes so loosely defined, that it 
lias not been in our power to determine with cer- 
tainty to what division of our work a plant really 
belonged : this has been particularly the case, when, 
as often occurs, it ir simply stated that the plant in 
question grows in the neighbourhood of some Town, 
idbich is situated perhaps on the borders of two or more 
Counties. From a somewhat similar cause we fear 

ba 



we may have been led to introduce habitats as distinct, 
which, though they are really the same, have been 
described to us in words somewhat difierent. In 
such circumstances, even when we apprehended this 
to be the case, we have still considered it a lesser evil 
to subject ourselves to the charge of useless repetition, 
than to incur any hazard of depriving our readers of 
information, which might possibly prove serviceable ; 
and it must be sufficiently evident that, although we 
might often have reason to suspect this error, it 
could but seldom be in our power to ascertain it. 
These, and other inaccuracies, we flatter ourselves 
with the hopes of amending, should the approbation 
of the Public ever call upon us for a second edition : 
in the mean time we shall lose no opportunity of 
correcting whatever we may ourselves discover to be 
erroneous, and we earnestly request the assistance 
of our Botanical friends for the same purpose. 

With regard to the plants selected as most un- 
common, we dare not indulge the hope that our list 
wBl meet with universal concurrence j for the rarity 
of vegetables is evidently a term of comparative im- 



ntEFACB; t 

port, and thisre are fbw British sp^ed^ which, how- 
ever abundant in some districts of the kingdoodi are 
not scarce in others^ 

OvA object has been to avoid, as £sr as possibles 
introducing those^ which, though confined to peculiar 
aituationsi are in these situations ahnost always to be 
found I and, indeed, had we not thus restrictefd our- 
selves, it would have been necessary to have embraced 
iii our catalogue the whole British Flora. At the 
same time it will be remarked, that by ibis plan many 
plants of rather unfrequent occurrence, are neces- 
sarily excluded: thus Cistus Heiianthemum, Hippo* 
crepis comosa^ AspenJa cytmnchicaj and others, which 
appear almost constantly with chalk. Beta maritimaf 
Salsola Kalif with a long list of maritime vegetables, 
and those that are equally limited to marshes or 
sands, cannot but be rarities to the Naturalist, 
whose neighbourhood does not furnish similar sta- 
dons ; not to mention two very striking instances in 
Cotyledon Umbilicus and Digitalif purpurea, neither of 
which is to be found in this part of the kingdom, 
though the former of them in the Northern^ and the 



iMJsi in tlie Soudustn and Western Cdunties^ ai« 
wnn mofd eomniM thian any Nettle or Thistle in the 
Bastem. We have made a point of noticing several 
remarkable varieties^ under the conviction that they 
deserve more attentbn than has been paid to them by 
most Botanists ; and in some few instances we have 
deviated from our general character cf compilers,' 
by subjoining, bs notes, the observations of our 
friends, or our own, upon these and other subjects 
that did not appear unworthy of remark, to which, 
lest from their scattered situation they should be 
wholly useless, we have added a separate Index. 

; The general Index of our work we have from its 
great length felt some reluctance in publishing; but 
our scruples on that head have given way to the con* 
sideration that by means of this alone an estimate can 
be formed of the comparative rarity of different plants^ 
and that, Were it omitted, it would be necessary to 
search through &e whole work to ascertain the known 
Staticms of those individuals, which have hitherto 
been detected in only two or three places in the 
kingdom.

plant in difierent places under different names« an 
error^ for my acquittal from which I appeal with con- 
fidence to the students of Cryptogamic Botany^ who 
will feel with me how difficult, I might indeed say 
how impossible, it is to avoid similar mistakes in 
compiling from authors, where the several terms are 
indiscriminately employed. The Fungi it was neces- 
sary entirely to omit, for. the difficulties and obscu- 
rities which prevail in this tribe, are even greater 
than those among the other orders of the same class, 
and we have besides to lament the total want of that 
knowledge, which might enable us in any degree to 
unravel their perplexities. It might indeed have 
been possible to have rend^ed our Cryptogamic list 
somewhat more interesting and complete, by entering 
upon the discuiibii of doubtful or contested points ; 
but, besides diat this would have been in direct oppo- 
sition to the principles of the work, it would not be 
practicable to treat these matters in a manner satis- 
factory either to our readers or ourselves within the 
limits of our book* 

The names here given to plants are almost uni<^ 
formly those employed in the Flora Britannica or 



PRBFACE. it 

EngUA Botany, except where the contrary is ex- 
pressly mentioned, and except in the cases of 
individuals, to which those publications have not 
yet extended. We have, however, ventured to 
insert some pb^mogamous species which Dr. Smith 
has omitted, but in these instances we have al- 
mrays stated the reasons by which we were in- 
fluenced, that other Botanists might judge of the 
pr<qnriety of allowing them hereafter to remain in the 

British Flora. Upon this head I must beg leave tQ 
offer it as my opinion that much less injury can be done 

to science by admitting twenty, the rights of which 

are questionable, than by being too scrupulous, and 

thereby incurring the hazard of excluding one which 

properly belongs to us. For, after all our care, it is 

impossible to ascertain how far any species is really 

indigenous or merely naturalized, nor, were this 

practicable, would it be worth the trouble ; as the 

use of every Flora must always be either to enable 

the Botanist to ascertain the plants he has already 

found, or to point out those which he may expect to 

* 

meet with, and whatever tends to circumscribe these 
effects cannot but be injurious to the utility of the 
work. * 



% »££rAce* 

We will not indeed deny that, independendy of 



tbe consideration just mentioned, the reflection that we 

may possibly be instrumental in extending the limits 

of the Flora of our Country has aflfbrded us no trifling 

pleasure ^ and it has also been a gratification to us 
that in some instances it has been in our power 

remove Ae uncertainty attending upon species, 

the existence of which in England was regarded as 

doubtful ; nor ought we to omit mentioning it as a 

source of satisfaction, that in one or two instances 

lure have been enabled to shew that the adfnission of 

particular plants originated only in mistake j for, 

whatever be the tendency of error, whether to 

favor or oppo3e our own wishes, the dispelling of it 

must ever be gratifying to an ingenuous mind. 

It is necessary to apologize to our Correspond 
dents and our Readers that the distributidn of mate- 
rials adopted in our work has obliged us to omit 
eome information, which we could not satisfactorily 
refer to its proper County. But this has been the 
case only in a few instances, except indeed among 
the older authors, nor did any other arrangement 



appear likely to be attended with equal conrei^ence 
and with less objection. 

A considerable difficulty arose in our minds whe* 
dier faabitatS) which have been long known, fhould in 
general be referred to those who originally discovered 
them, or whether, where it was in our power, it 
would not be proper to quote the testimony of more 
recent observers { the latter plan may appear to rest 
upon better authority, and would evidently have the 
advantage of shewing that the plants continue to grow 
in the places assigned to them : but a sentiment of 
justice towards those of whose labors 'we now reap 
die fruits, and a feeling that we are acting in the 
manner in which we should ourselves wish others to 
act towards us, have induced us to forego these ad* 
vantages, except in the ^ases of those stations which 
have been called in question, and except where the 
communications of our friends defined the spot more 
accurately than had been done before. 

In addition to what has already been said, it is right 
to observe, that the present work is indebted for it»

origin exclujsively to Mr. JXOwjn, whoj Uke many 
other Botanists, accustoming himself as often as he left 
home to select the places of growth of those plants 
which were likely to occur to his notice, was induced 
to extract whatever referred to the most uncommon 
species from *" Ray, Withering, &c, and reduce it to 
the following arrangements The plan thus beguii 
merely for his own use and atnusement proved a 
more extensive task than he had conceived, and was 
regarded by his friends as likely to be of general 
utility ; so that by their persuasion he was led to en- 
tertain the idea of preparing it for the public in the 
manner which is here e^cted by our united endea-> 
vours. Far, however, from confining ourselves to the 
selecting of that information which had been previously 
published, we have ventured to call upon many of 
the Botanists of the Kingdom for their aa3istancej and 
we are proud to own that our requests have on all 
tides been complied with in the moil flattering manner. 

* Whatever habitats are taken from Ray, Blackstone, Waring^ 
Deering, Jacobs, and most of the more early writers, rest entirely 
iqton the authority of Mr. Dillwyn. 



PHEFACE. xiU 

For the interest and trouble which these Gentlemen 
have been so kind as to take on our behalf, we feel our- 
selves extremely indebted, and, as die most effectual 
means of ackno^edging our obligations, we have uni- 
formly subjoined dielr names to Ac information they 
rcfpectively afforded: indeed, for the sake of our 
readers, we thought it right so entirely to cpnform to 
this principle, as even to place our own initials after 
those stations which depend upon our personal ob- 
servation. 

We are not aware that a work similar to the 
present has ever 'yet appeared, either in England or 
any other Country, excepting Professor Martyn's 
Herbationes annexed, to his Plant a Cantabrigiensesj 
an underteking, commenced under precisely the same 
impression, but extremely limited in point of extent, 
and of which it is much to be regretted, that, though 
he admits the greater part to be a compilation, he has 
only in few instances quoted his authorities ; so that 
he leaves his reader wholly ignorant as to what is de- 
rived from his own remarks, and how far the sources 
whwice he has drawn his information are those on 



XIV PREFACE. 

which safe reliance may be placed. . We must own 
that we have more than once had reason to suspect 
the accuracy of his Catalogue ^ as when, for instance^ 
we found Euphorbia Portlandica placed in an inland 
Situation, Primula farimsa in so southern a County as 
Kent, Lycopodium annotinum on Iver heath, with some 
other instances, which we have noticed in their places^ 
from a desire of inducing other Botanists to examine 
the fact, and ascertain the plants really intended* 

Besides the general obligations which we owe to our 
different friends for the itiformation they have afforded^ 
particular thanks are due to Mr. Joseph Wopds, jun, 
who took upon himself the trouble of selecting a con-p 
giderable quantity of materials from Merrctt's Pinaxj 
and various topographical authors to which our situa* 
tions, remote from the splendid libraries of the Me- 
tropolis, denied us the power of obtaining. access. 
That much more information lies scattered in other 
similar publications cannot be doubted, and we Oiould 
have been happy to have availed ourselves of it, but 
the difficulty of procuring these works must plead 
pur excuse for not Jjaving quoted them. 



PREFACE. X? 

It has been suggested that the Botanisfs Guide, 
by pointing out the ftatlons of plants, may possibly 
lead to the extirpation of some which are least com* 
mon. Could we allow force to this argument we 
would never permit the Manuscript to see the light ; 
but we flatter ourfelves that the Botanists of 
England do not deserve such a reproach, and we 
really believe that there is too much honor among the 
Votaries of Science to destroy, wantonly, for their 
own gratification, that which may hereafter prove a 
source of pleasure to many others: indeed. We are 
convinced that, far from wishing to eradicate, there 
is not a Naturalist in the Kingdom who would not 
feel gratified at any addition to the British Flora, and 
who would not, on the other hand, experience a sensi<» 
ble regret at the erasure of a single individual from iU 

Thekp are two other objects, which, though 
less immediately in our view, the present work 
may be calculated to answer. It will point out 
.those parts of the kingdom hitherto least explored ; 
and, by giving a comparative view of the productions 
of different Qounties, may be useful in denoting their

tend to prove to the Naturalists of other parts how 
zealously the study of indigenous Botany is here 
cultivated, and will shew them that, while the vege- 
tables trodden under their feet are in many places ne- 
glected for the more gaudy productions of the hotter 
zones, the Botanists of England place their greatest

That this work is to be regarded not so much as a 
specimen of what may be expected from the different 
Counties, as of the activity of those Naturalists who 
have hitherto explored them, is an observation that 
has repeatedly forced itself upon our minds in the 
course of our undertaking; and no where more 
strongly than in the instance of Bedfordshire, which, 
from its situation, its size, and the uniformity of its 
surface, appears to promise as little as any in the king- 
dom; and yet the unwearied activity of Dr. Abbot, 
almost wholly unassisted, has enabled him to publish 
a Flora containing no less than 1225 species. From 
this source we have necessarily extracted almost all 
our materials for the list of the County ; and we beg 
leave to observe that the example of Dr. Abbot affords 
the most pleasing as well as convincing proof to every 
young Botanist, that, if he have but zeal and industry, 
there is no fear of his finding a sufficient field for dis- 
covery to repay his exertions.

BRECKNOCKSHIRE. 



The very reverse of what we have observed on 
Bedfordshire holds good with regard to Brecknock, and 
the greater part of the Welsh couaties. No where in 
our Island, south of the Tweed, does nature prefent 
more favorable opportunities for the cultivation, or 
more extensive fields for the discovery of her treasures, 
and yet, Angular as it may appear, no where has less 
attention been paid to them. This work, therefore, 
by shewing how little has hitherto been done, we truft 
will operate as a stimulus to those Botanists who have 
leisure and opportunity, to turn their minds to these 
parts of the kingdom j and we fliall certainly at all 
times consider ourselves obliged by communications, 
tending to enrich any future Edition, should the ap- 
probation of the Public ever require one.

♦ It would have been cas^, by extracts from the works of Mr. 
Evans, not only to have swelled our list, as well in the present, » in 
every other Welsh county, but to have added several new species to 
the British Flora ; and we should have been happy to have availed 
ourselves of the information he affords, especially as he professes to 
have undertaken his journies <' for botanical purposes, and with a 
view to publishing at some future period a Flora Cambrica,** had 
we not had too much reason to suspect his botanical accuracy, and 
indeed, had we not in some instances from the assurances of Bo- 
tanists resident upon the spot, and from having ourselves fpUowed 
his footsteps, been convinced that the plants are not always to be 
found in the stations he has assigned to them. This, therefore, we 
trust will plead our apology for not having quoted him more freely ; 
and, as his Tours have been favorably received by the public, wc 
hope, that in some future edition he will correct those inaccuracies, 
vi which Naturalists have now cause to complain.

CAMBRIDGESHIRE. 



" That our list of the more rare plants of Cam- 
bridgeshire should be so comparatively disproportion- 
ate to Its extent will cease to appear remarkable, 
when it is considered how much its Botany has been 
cultiYated, beyond that of any other part of England. 
Mr. Ray, who in 1660 published his Catalogue of 
Cambridgeshire plants, enumerated no less than 624 
indigenous to the County, to which in 1685 he had 
made the addition of 102 more. Professor Martyn's 
Plantx Cantabrigienses, edited in I763, increased the 
number to 829, and that at s^ time when the whole 
Flora Anglica comprized only 1569 ; since which the 
indefatigable Mr. Relhjan and his friends have made 
a farther addition of 5251 raising the list of species 
contained in the last Edition of his excellent Flora 
Cantabrigiensis to 1334* This addition indeed is 
greatly to be accounted for from the furprizing in- 
^reale w&icb onr knowledge of Cryptogamic Botany

dividual. I have noticed the same things but ProfefliMi Martyn*t 
remark that G. campeitris and Amarella are not distinct it -by BO 
means well founded, for the habit of the two plants it very. 
different, and in the latter the segments of the Calyx arc equal, 
vhcrcas in the former they are always altcinatcly large and imall.

CARNARVONSHIRE. 



Carmaryonshire, in a botanical point of view, 
may certainly be considered the best cultivated, as 
well as the most interesting of the Welsh Counties. 
Its Mountains surpassing in height every other in the 
Principality, afford inexhaustible fields for discovery ; 
and from the days of Dillenius, when they were in- 
vestigated by that able Botanist and his Friends, to the 
present, have never ceafed to attract the attention of 
travellers of taste and science. For the greater part, 
however, of what we know respecting their Botany, 
especially in the Class Cryptogamia, we are indebted 
to two Naturalists of our own time, Rev. Hugh 
Davies and JohnWynne Griffith, Esq. the latter of whom 
in particular, joining to a most acute mind an ardor 
that cannot be surpassed, continues to explore the 
Botany of this and the neighbouring Counties ; and it 
is to be hoped, will shortly favor the public with ob- 
servations upon the British Lichens, which his situa- 
tion and knowledge so well enable him to illustrate.

is yet to be done in this interesting county, which is 
in many respects peculiarly favourable to the culd-

differ from him in opinion. I never saw on any part of the Coast,

the whole habit is distinct from the conunon species ; and the leaves 
very mdike in form, as well as appearance and hairiness, besides 
pther differences pointed out by Dr. Withering. Unless it snffen 
very material alteration &om culture, which I understand it does 
not, it appears to me to have as clear a right to be considered a spe«

CUMBERLAND. 



The County of Cumberland, which may justly 
be called the most alpine district of England, abounds 
so much in wild rocky situations, contains so great a 
variety of surface, and- has on account of its beautiful 
scenery so continually been visited by travellers, that 
It might be expected we should be able to enumerate 
a catalogue of its rare plants at least equal to that 
furnished by any other County. This, however, is 
by no means the case ; and our list would have been 
very deficient had it not been for Mr. Hutchinson's 
History of Cumberland, from the Flora of which, 
prepared by the Rev. William Richardson, we have 
made very copious extracts ; and had not our friend 
Mr. Harriman kindly procured us from the Rev. 
John Dodd, of Wigton, the habitats followed by his 
name, and that of Mr. Wood of Whitehaven. A few 
only of Mr. Huttoij's habitats were communicated by 
himself: the rest were extracted from Mr. Hutchin- 
son's History, were they stand avowedly upon his 



144 CUMBERLAND. 

authority. Some of the plants are certainly not 
what we should have kxdced for in similar situations, 
so that it is impossible not to suspect that he has fal- 
len into errors ; but as this indefatigable Naturalist 
b a resident at Keswick, and acts as Guide to the 
Lakes, it will be easy for any Botanist to avail him- 
self of his assistance, and visit the stations of his most 
rare plants ; his readiness to shew which, and indeed 
to render himself useful by all means in his power, 
we ourselves experienced on a Tour to the Lakes 
nine years since.

DENBIGHSHIRE, 



It may be observed that we have frequently in oup 
list of this County, as well as occasionally in Camar-; 
vonfhire and Flintshire, copied articles verbatim from 
Mr. Bingley's Tour, and instead of his name subjoined 
that of Mr. Griffith. In all these cases the habitats 
were originally communicated by this gentleman, 
though inserted without an acknowledgment; and 
we have considered that we should best discharge our 
duty to the public by referring them to the. original 
source, as it is impossible for any information to be 
so authentic, as that derived from those Naturalists 
who have long been resident in a county, and be- 
stowed a continued application tp the subjefl:. Uppn 
the Botany of Denbighshire we are not aware that any 
thing has yet been published, nor much observed, 
unless by Mr. Griffith : its features however bear so 
strong a resemblance to tUo$p of North Wales in 
general, that, excepting the few species which are 
peculiar to the highest Mountains, it may fairly be 
^xpedled that its vegetable produftions should no^ 
piaterially differ from those of the adjoining counties.

* 'The County of* Devonshire, the second hi the RiAg« 
dpnx in point of extent, has long been knowii to coih- 
piize several plants, which are scarcely to be found 
in. any other part of £ngland, especially Scirpus hotos^ 
chcenuSf Polycarpon tetraphyllumy and Oxalis corniculata. 
To these is now to be joined Cynoglossum omphaloaeSf 
which ve have added to the British List entirely upon 
the authority of Mr. Polwhele, who does not appear 
  to entertain any doubt of its right to a place in our 
Flora, from its having been found among the rocks at 
Tfcignmouth, a spot so wild that it is' by no means 
pi\)bable it should have been planted there intention- 
ally, or that the. seeds ishould by any accident have 
escaped out of a garden. From, this Gentleman's 

history of the county we have derived that great pro- 
portion of our present Catalogue, which stands either 



? 



DEVONSHIRE. M6 

under 4us name, or those of Dr. Wavell, Mr. "Weston, 
Mr. Yqnge, and Mr. Cornish. Bishop Gibson also, 
in his edition of Camden, has inserted in this, as in 
many other instances, a list of the Indigenous plants, 
irid Mr. Pike of Biddeford, has published a catalogue 
of those found in his own neighbourhood ; but mahy 
df these, as Mr. Polwhele observes, are not peculiar 
to that Town, or its environs, and, besides this. He 
leaves room for suspefting his accuracy, by having 
inserted the Coix Lachryma Jobi, which Acre is no 
reason to believe really a native of this Kingdom. 

m 

In spite of all this, however, Devonshire is by no 
means one of those Counties whose Botany appears 
to have been most successfully investigated, and yre 
have no doubt of seeing at some future time a much 
more copious catalogue of its rare vegetable pro- 
dudions.

We are not aware that any thing has hitherto 
been published respefting the Botany of Durham, 
and therefore feel a particular satisfaftion in finding 
our Catalogue of this County equal to that of almost 
any other in the Kingdom 5 for which we are entirely 
indebted to the kindness of Mr. Harriman, and Mr. 
Winch, the latter of whom furnished not merely the 
habitats followed by his own name, but those also on 
the authority of Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Weighell, Mr. 
Waugh, and Mr. Thornhill. There is perhaps no 
part of England where the study of Botany, and 
especially the class Cryptogamia, has of late years 
been more sedulously cultivated 5 and we regret that 
in our list, copious at it is, we have, from the nature 
of our work, been obliged to omit many recent dis- 
coveries made among the Mosses by Mr. Winch, 
and among the Lichens by Mr. Harriman 5 a circum- 
ftance, however, that we the less lament, as, at the 
request of that most useful and respectable body, the 
Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle,

* The claim which the plants found upon the various hills near 
Sunderland, formed of ballast from all p«trt$ of Europe, have to be 
considered as natives of this County, is at best questionable. As 
many of them, however, may be naturalized there, and may thence 
havo olbtained the appearance of indigenous, we thought it best to 
incorporate tHose which were previously known to belong to onr 
Flora ; but besides these, Mr. Robson in his Catalogue of ** Plant» 
rariores agro Dunelmensi indigenit,'* printed some years since for 
the use of his friends, has included also the following, which npt

GLOUCESTERSHIRE, 



In our list of this Gjunty we have particularly to 
beg the indulgence of our readers for a kind of inac-> 
curacy, which in a work^ like the present, it is im- 
possible wholly to avoid. By far the greater part of 
the information vie. have been able to obtain respect-^ 
ing tbe Ifotany of Gloucestershire has related to those 
plants which grpw on St. Vincent's rocks, or else- 
where in the ixnxnediate vicinity of Bristol, and whe-> 
ther these ought to be arranged under the prefent 
County or Somersetshire is what we have in many 
instances had no means of determining. Some of 
them we therefore fear are referred to wrong 
Counties, and others are^ probably with equal impro-^ 
priety, placed in both ; a circumstance we thought it 
right to mention, that we might not mislead, more 
thw could be avoided, our friends who may visit this> 
pai^t of the Kingdom,^and who, we flatter ourselves,^ 
will hold vs acqmtted of mistakes, which, we are 
Sony to s^y, we have found inseparable from the n^^ 
tureof our undertaking.

HEREFORDSHIRE. 



From Mr. Duncumb's History of Herefordshire, of 
wHich the firft Volume has very recently made its ap- 
pearance^ we had hoped to have collected materials fdr 
a copious list of the planta rariores of this County. 
In this hope, however, we have found ourfelves disap- 
pointed, for the Catalogue given by that Gentleman is 
far from considerable ; and, as he has particularized 
no stations of plants, but merely divided them into the 
productions of the Northern, Eastern, and centri- 
cal parts of the County, it is of no use towards the 
leading object of our work, that of directing Botanists 
in their researches. At the same time, as it serves to 
convey some idea of the vegetable productions of 
Herefordshire, we have extracted from it all the ma- 
terials in our power, regretting most heartily that we 
have not had the means of procuring better informa- 
tion with respect to a part of the kingdom so favorable 
to the pursuit of Natural History.

HUNTINGDONSHIRE 



From the immediate vicinity of this County to 
Camlwridgeshire, we had hoped to have been able to * 
procure at least a respectable list of its vegetable 
rarities, but how entirely these hopes have been disap- 
pointed is sufficiently evident from the two following 
pages. Mr. Relhan is indeed almost the only Botanist 
whom we know to have bestowed any considerable 
attention upon its Natural History ; and this Gentle- 
man some years since furnished Mr. Hutchinson, 
who then intended to publish a History of Hunting- 
donshire, with a list of about 800 indigenous plants, 
describing the habitats of the more rare ones. This 
list we have unfortunately not been able to procure, 
nor has Mr. Relhan preserved any copy of it ; so that 
we can only hope some future Botanist will fill up 
the blank we here find ourselves obliged to leave.
