ON JUNCUS TENUIS AS A BEITISH PLANT. 
By H. N. Eidley, M.A., F.L.S. 

(Tab. 253.) 

The first time that we hear of this plant as a native of the 
British Isles is in ' English Botany,' t. 2174, published in 1816, 
where it is described by Sir J. E. Smith as a new species under the 
name of Juncus gracilis. Later, Smith (Engl. Flora, ii. 167) altered 
the name to J. Gesneri, as the name J. ;/mcilis was previously in use. 
The specimens from which it was described were stated to have 
been collected by George Don in Forfar in 1795 or 1796, and in 
the mountains of Scotland by Dickson. In Gardiner's ' Flora of 
Forfar,' p. 183, it is recorded thus : — " By a rivulet in marshy 
ground among the mountains of Clova, near their summits. Mr. 
G. Don and Mr. D. Don." 

There are two specimens of the plant in flower in a collection of 
Grasses, Cyperacece, and Juncacea made by George Don, preserved 
in the Natural History Museum, and specimens are stated by Mr. 
G. C. Druce (' Scottish Naturalist,' Oct., 1884, p. 264) to exist in 
two other collections made by Don. The plant is not localised in 
the British Museum collection, but in one of those seen by Mr. 
Druce it is labelled Clova. From that time till 1883 the plant has 
never been rediscovered in Britain, and has long dropped out of the 
botanical books, it being supposed that Don distributed the plant 
by mistake, having either cultivated it in his garden or obtained it 
from abroad, as was confessedly the case in certain of his reputed 
discoveries. The other plants, however, in his collection in the 
British Museum are natives of Britain, although some were certainly 
not obtained from Forfar. 

In this Journal for 1884, p. 91, is a note from Mr. E. F. 
Towndrow announcing his discovery of the plant in a rough and 
rushy pasture in the parish of Cradley, in Herefordshire. He found 
there but a single tuft. The plant was verified by Mr. Baker, and 
specimens were also sent to the Natural History Museum. These 
specimens are in flower, and, it is interesting to note, bear a great

similarity to those of Don, being rather more weak and gracile than 
most of the continental specimens. 

The distribution of the plant has several points of interest. It 
is common in North America, extending across the whole continent 
from Hudson's Bay to Mexico. In Europe it is much rarer, occur- 
ring sporadically in Holland, between Auersfort and Nykerke 
(Boidninl); in Belgium, at Aerschot {Van Heurckl); in Schleswig- 
Holstein (Hansen !) ; in France, at Nantes {Billot !). In Germany 
it seems more common, especially in Saxony : Gorlitz and Eoths- 
stein, at 1400 ft. (Baenitz !) ; Herrnhut {Hans !) ; Tharand (Ueichen- 
bachl); Eostan [Martens \) ; also in Swabian Bavaria, near Mem- 
mingen {Koeherlin\) ; and in Bohemia. It is also found in Madeira 
{Mandon\); in the Cape Verde Isles {R. T. Lowe\); and in the 
Azores {Drouet !) ; and near Nelson, in the North Island of New 
Zealand [Chcesemcm !). 

Thus it will be seen that as far as regards Europe it is strictly 
Western, and may be considered as a Germanic type. It appears 
to prefer roadsides, especially in sandy places, such as paths across 
heaths or through pine-forests, and to avoid high ground and wet 
localities, facts which seem to throw doubt upon Don's habitat, 
which, if genuine, would be the most northern limit of the species 
in Europe. It seems hardly necessary to state that there is no 
evidence that it is a recent introduction from North America, but 
possibly it may be a relic of the old land-connection with that con- 
tinent, like Kriocaulon septanijulare. 

I subjoin a description of the plant, with its more important 
synonyms : —

somewhat involute and channelled, six to nine inches long. The 
panicle usually loose, erect, the last stem-leaf overtopping it 
generally considerably; petals and sepals pale, narrowly lanceolate, 
acuminate, 1|- to 2 lines in length, usually slightly spreading in 
fruit. Stamens 6, Capsule ovate, oblong, shortly mucronate, 
yellowish and shining, usually shorter than the perianth. Seeds

OXFOEDSHIKE MOSSES. 
By Henry Boswell. 



The period elapsed since the publication of the list of Mosses 
in this -Journal for 1872 (pp. 363-374) has been not altogether 
unproductive, rather more than a dozen additional sj)ecies having 
been discovered ; some new localities have been found for others, 
and a few of those only reported as barren have been obtained in 
fruit. In recording these I take the opportunity of making one or 
two corrections of the previous list, and of enumerating the 
HepaticcB which have come under notice. These latter are not 
numerous ; they require for the most part even a greater degree of 
shelter and atmospheric moisture than the mosses proper, and a 
drained and cultivated country is unfavourable to the growth of 
the majority of the species. 

Mosses. 

Dicravoiceissia cirrhata (Hedw.) Lindb. [WeiHsia). On thatch of 
an old shed at Ascott-under-Wychwood, in plenty, March, 1879. 
The shed has subsequently been removed, and at present I know of 
no other Oxfordshire site for this moss, though it is comparatively 
frequent in the neighbouring county of Worcester, and westwards 
into Herefordshire. March, A^n-il. 

Dicranum majus Turn. Fruits in the woods about Watlington, 
Stokeuchurch, and Wycombe. Large but barren in Singe Wood, 
near Witney. June, July. 

Leucohrijuin (jlaucuin Hedw. Woods near Goring. 

Fissidcns jmsilhis Wils. On both earth and stones in hedge- 
banks near Witney and Hailey. November to February. — F. in- 
curims Sch. Tar Wood ; plentiful. February, March. — F. cxilis 
Hedw. Tar Wood, with the last ; and at Stockley, Wychwood 
Forest. Winter. — F. inconstans Sch. Founded on my Sunning- 
well specimens, seems to be only a spart of F. hnjoides, possessing 
no substantial characters. It occurred in 1880 between Witney 
and Burlord, but 1 could never regard it as a good species.

place seems to be the loose soil at foot of a wall, but it occurs also 
on stones, and on trees in watery places. Wall at Han well, near 
Banbury ; sandy hedge-banks near Henley and Bagley Wood. A 
singular moss, unknown as yet in fruit ; perhaps will prove even- 
tually merely a depauperated state of the next. — T. tortnosa L.

and also many specimens passing as U. crisjxi and Bruchii in 
herbaria, — for instance, Mr. Croall's specimens in the ' Plants of 
Braemar.' It appears the most widely sjn-ead of the group, grow- 
ing very much larger in the north : specimens that I gathered in 
Kosshire and Skye are the finest I have seen, but Mr. MacAndrew 
sends nearly as fine from Kirkcudbrightshire, where it grows in 
company v.'itli Bruchii, crispa, crispida, and Drummondii, the last 
two much less plentiful. July. 

Orthotrichum obtusijolium Sclirad. On two ash trees near

Headington Copse. Winter. 

Eurhynchiam crassinerviiim Tayl. Near Witney ; Asthalleigh ;

Hypnum falcatuin Brid. Still exists at Bullingdon, but under 
very precarious circumstances, the bog being for the most part 
drained and brought under a sort of cultivation. H. Sendtneri is 
quite a different thing, and allied to revolvens. It seems not to be 
found in this region, but is frequent enough in districts of a peaty 
and sandy character. — H. arcuatum Lindb. (not Hedw.) ; H. pratense 
Wils., Bryol. Brit, (not Koch) ; H. Patienticv Lindb. On heavy 
loam, side of a ride in Coggs Wood. It seems altogether a summer 
moss, disappearing in winter, when most of the Hypnoid mosses 
flourish.

ON SENECIO SPATHUL.EFOLIUS DC. 

By J. G. Bakee, F.E.S. 

My own impression with regard to Senecio spathulqfolius, if I 
may be excused for expressing a difference from the views of two 
such high authorities as Professor Babington and Sir J. D. Hooker, 
is that the Holyhead plant is substantially the Senecio spathuhpfolius 
of DeCandolle, but that it is only a variety of S.-campestris, with the 
characters that Sir J. D. Hooker has assigned to it in placing it as 
such. Take the two plants in combination, and they extend over 
a geographical area reaching from Britain and Scandinavia in the 
north-west, through Central Europe to Spain, Italy, Croatia, 
Servia, and Transylvania, and crossing the Ural through the 
whole breadth of Siberia to Manchuria and Kamschatka. This 
aggregate is represented in the Kew Herbarium by two large 
bundles, containing specimens of upwards of fifty different gather- 
ings from various countries through this wide area, and in 
attempting to sort out the spathuUifuliHs from the caiiipcstris I have 
utterly failed in drawing any clear line of demarcation between the 
two. The types of the two are characterised excellently in Koch's 
Synopsis, but between campestris as figured in ' English Botany ' 



THE BOTANY OF THE BARROW. 9 

and spathulafoUus as figured in Reichenbach's ' Plantfe Criticae,' 
fig. 240, one finds eveiy intermediate gradation in robustness of 
habit, in the shape, texture and petiolation of tlie leaves, in the 
number and size of the capitula, and in the vestiture of the leaves 
and involucral bracts. In Britain the genuine campestris, so far as 
I have had the opportunity of seeing it, grows on the dry turf of 
the top of our chalk downs, associated with such jjlants as Canlaus 
acaulis, Gentinna campestris, and Amarella and Chlora perfoliata. 
Take a Composite from a station like this and place it for once on 
a sea-cliff, and a great difference in size and luxuriance may 
reasonably be expected. I have not yet seen the Micklefell speci- 
mens, but shall be surprised if they agree with the Holyhead form. 

Another point to be considered is that here, as in many other 
cases, making two species needlessly out of one lands us in a 
suppositious geographical anomaly. According to Grenier and 
Godron, there is no campestris at all in France, but all the French 
plant is spatlinheJ'uUus. But cross the Channel, and immediately 
on the chalk downs of Sussex and the Isle of Wight campestris 
begins, and there is no spathidcBfuiius till the whole breadth of 
England and Wales is crossed. Speaking from a geographical 
point of view, one would not care to believe in such an anomaly as 
this, unless there were very decided evidence in its favour. I find 
that in ' Topographical Botany ' we made a mistake in registering 
both campestris and spathuUrfolius from Anglesea. Campestris is 
given on the authority of Mr. John Ball, and I find on referring to 
his specimens in Mr. Watson's herbarium that it represents the 
ordinary Holyhead maritima. In connection with the matter 
reference may also be made to Prof. Babington's note in 'Loudon's 
Magazine of Natural History,' vol. v., p. 88, where two extreme 
forms of the Cambridgeshire plant are figured, and to a note at 
page 43 of the ' Report of the Botanical Record Club for 1883.' 

Finally, Prof. Babiugton is mistaken in supposing that DeCau- 
dolle nowhere quotes the name " Cineraria lanceolata, Lam. Fl. 
Franc, ii. 125." He will find it duly cited in the 'Prodromus,' not 
in connection with spathido'/oHns, but as a synonym of S. campestris 
j3. vulyaris, and yet of course it refers to a plant native in France. 



THE BOTANY OF THE BARROW. 

By H. C. Hart, B.A. 

. The River BarroAv takes its rise on the north side of the Slieve 
Bloom Mountains, in the north-west of the Queen's County. 
From here it runs north for a short distance, and then east to 
Monasterevan, on the borders of the same county. From Monas- 
terevan the Barrow runs south, separating Kildare from Queen's 
County till it reaches Carlow, and subsequently it divides the 
latter county from Kilkenny, becoming tidal at St. Mullins. A little 
loYv^er, having received the waters of the Nore, it becomes a wide 
estuary at New Ross. Widening farther south it receives the Sun-,

and helps to form the noble inlet of Waterford Harbour. From its 
source to its union with the Nore the Barrow is about 110 miles in 
length, and from Millford, in Carlow, to New Ross, in Wexford, 
the scenery is in many places very lovely ; Graiguenamanagh and 
the wooded declivities along the reaches past Borris and St. Mullius 
are scenes of extreme beauty. 

The upper half of the river, from the base of the Slieve Blooms 
to Atliy, is an uncertain wandering through a plain where the river 
frequently loses itself in a swampy fiat, to be converted into a 
shallow lake in winter — an undrained and undrainable region, 
rendered hopelessly so by the numerous weirs and mill-dams from 
Athy onwards. This part of the river is rich in marsh species — 
many local ones abound ; and ducks and other aquatic birds breed 
here undisturbed in vast numbers. Numerous ruins of castles, 
some noble, others merely picturesque, as well as several hand- 
somely castellated and imposing mills adorn the banks. Wooded 
demesnes lie along, and sametimes, as at Garryhinch, lie under the 
water for a considerable distance. Continually was I asked the 
all-important question, "Will the drainage be finished this year? " 
and I found it useless to attempt to deny my coimection with a 
company said to exist for that purpose. What could a man with 
neither gun, rod, nor dog otherwise be up to ? 

For a considerable distance (from Athy to St. MuUins) there 
is a tow-path for canal-boats either actually on the bank of the 
Barrow or else a few perches from it, on the parallel canal, where 
the two arc not in combination. I was always careful to follow 
that bank of the river which was not under this contaminating 
influence. This of course was entirely m opposition to the common- 
sense views of occasional well-wishers and would-be guides along 
its course, and no doubt the labour would have been greatly 
reduced had I accepted advice ; but the natural and swampy side 
had undeniable claims on a botanist. I spent 5^ days on this 
exploration, taking another day among the bogs, and up the Black 
or Figile river, near Monasterevan. My travels lay chiefly in 
District III. of the ' Cybele Hibernica,' but in the upper part of the 
river I started along Districts VII. and V. To the floras of these 
three districts I added upwards of seventy plants. Amongst these 
species thus discovered in new localities are NasUirtium sylvestre. 
Campanula Trachelinm, and Carex axillaris, the first two of which 
were previously known from a single Irish district apiece, while the 
latter has been authenticated from a single locality only — that of 
Kinsale, in Cork. Again, it was very interesting to observe the 
striking abundance of some very local species in Ireland, such as 
Stellaria (jhiiica, Gbjceria aquatica, and Scirpus sijlraticiis ; while 
numerous uncommon plants were found in new habitats. 

The River Barrow, it may be seen, has received little attention 
at the hands of botanists. In the ' Cybele Hibernica,' under 
Butomns nmhcllatus, will be found the words, " Sent from the Barrow 
to Threlkeld." I was always on the look-out for this species, but 
without success. Again, in the Supplement to the Cybele, we find 
under Glyceria aquatica, "In the Barrow, below Carlow; R. Clayton 



THE BOTANY OF THE BAREOW.

Browne." This species extends almost the entire length of the 
river. One or two other less noteworthy references occur. 

I will now enumerate the species I met with, which are not 
recorded from their respective districts in the ' Cybele Hibernica ' 
or its Hupplement : —

12 THE BOTANY OF THE BARROW. 

Some of the foregoing have no doubt been recorded elsewhere, 
since the publication of the ' Cybele Hibernica,' from these districts. 
A list of gaps like the above shows how much remains to be done 
in ascertaining the distribution of our Irish plants. I will now 
give a running account of my exploration, so as to point out the 
habitats of the rarer plants. 

On June 20th I made an excursion towards the Barrow from 
Graigavern, where I was experiencing the hospitality of some friends 
and relatives. Graigavern lies about three miles south-west from 
Monasterevan, in the Queen's County, and abont two miles west of 
the river, which has here turned to its southern destination. In 
its immediate neighbourhood Viola odorata, Listera ovata, Arum 
maculatioit, liijpericiim AmlroscRmum, and Viburnum Opidus were 
prominent species. A couple of miles south of Graigavern, between 
Ballybrittas and the Barrow, is an extensive bog, which is inter- 
sected also by the Grand Canal, Here I spent some hours. The 
species noted were Carduus jiratensis, Carex pulicaris, C. paniculata, 
C. acuta, C. fulva, Osmunda regalis, Drosera rotxindifolia, Potamogeton 
jnisilhis, Utricularia vulgaris, Sparganium yninimum, Catabrosa aqua- 
tica, Banunculus sclcratus, L'emna trisulca, Kiipatorium cannabinum, 
Bidens cernna, and commoner sorts. This bog is a breeding resort 
for redshanks and teals, and many other aquatic birds. Towards 
Ballybrittas, by the "Waterfall" river, I saw Juncus glaucus, 
(Enanthe Fhellandrium, ALisma ranunculoides, Silene infiata, and 
Ophioglossum imlgatum ; and near "Allan Yorks" Bridge Chlora 
perfoliata, Daucus Carota, Chelidoniiim majns, and Saponaria 
ojjicinalis. About Ballybrittas Vibunnmi Opulus, Tragopogon pra- 
tense, and Exionymus eurojmus are frequent. Near Graigavern 
Potamogeton crispus, Helosciadium inundatum, and Orchis incarnata 
occurred. These remarks apply to District III., and several of 
the above are additions to its flora. 

On June 21st I started from Monasterevan up the Kiver Barrow. 
A little above the town were (Enanthe PhclJandrium , Klodea canadensis, 
Sium, nodiflorum, Nuphar lutea, Fianunculus pseudo-jiuitans, and the 
commoner pond-weeds occur. A very conspicuous plant here is a 
large, rather wrinkle-leaved, reddish pond-weed, which had no trace 
of inflorescence, but is, I believe, P. rnfescens. The river here is 
about twenty yards across, deep, and sluggish. The country round 
is so flat that after continuous rain the floods are sometimes so 
extensively spread as to drown large tracts. An Englishman with 
utilitarian views, who visited this district recently under such cir- 
cumstances, remarked with becoming superiority that, had they 
such sheets of water in his neighbourhood, piers, boat-houses, 
steamers, and considerable traffic would be the natural and imme- 
diate consequence. The plants last mentioned, with Lijchnis 
vespertina by the water's edge, in shady thickets of blackthorn, and 
Carex vesicaria, L'oa aquatica, Viburiinm Opulus, and Apargia hispida 
are frequent on both jjanks, north and sou.th, i. e., District VII. and 
District V., for the river here divides them. 

At Baylough Bridge, a couple of miles west of Monasterevan, 
I crossed to the north bank of the river into District VII. 



THE BOTANY OF THE BAREOW. 13 

Euonyvms and Viburnum are frequent and characteristic. In heavy 
ditches parallel to the river Carex acuta, C. stricta, C. disticha, and 
M yriophijllum verticiUaUim are not unfrequent. (-. stricta forms 
large tussocks, from which the pale flowering stems spreads out as 
the fronds from the crown of a shield-fern. In these wet meadows 
and ditches, swamps in winter, the plants noted were Carex fulva, 
which forms the main herbage, Juncns (jlaucus, Listera ovata, Samo- 
lus Valerandi, Geum rivale, CEnantlie Pliellandrium, Solanum Dulca- 
mara, Nuphar lutea, Fotamo(jeton pectinatus, and Stellaria glauca. 
The latter is very local in Ireland, but it occurs in many places 
here and elsewhere along the Barrow. Catahrosa aquatica and 
Botrychium Lunariu occurred along here also, and in the stream 
Nasturtium amphibium begins to be frequent. Bromus commutatus 
also occurs. Opposite Lea Castle Carex vesicaria is abundant, 
while Lysimacliia vulgaris, Myosotis palustris, Tlialictrum viajus, 
Hippuris, Alchemilla vulgaris, Fotaviogeto7i pectinatus, and P. lucens 
are frequent. Here I first met a very handsome species, Scirpus 
sylvaticus, which is very local in Ireland. Twayblade is extra- 
ordinarily abundant along the riverside banks. The Barrow here 
is only of ordinary beauty ; Lea Castle is, however, an imposing 
ruin. Between it and Portarlington Pyrus Aria, Crepis jxdudosa, 
Alnus glutiiiosa, Epilobium, hirsutum, Alopecitrus geniculatus, Sym- 
phytum, vulyare, and Tragupugun pratense are prevailing species, and 
those previously mentioned mostly occur again. At Portarlington 
I rested for lunch. By the railway banks I noted Orchis jnjrami- 
dalis. Here for a space the river lies entirely in District III. ; the 
county boundary and it part company for one mysterious mile. 
Carex vesicaria, C. acuta, Myriophyllum verticillatum, and Scirpus 
sylvaticus all still aj)pear. The water-lily is all the yellow Xupkar. 
The river is here much prettier, winding amongst timber and 
wooded slopes. Elodea canadensis was noted, as well as Valeriana 
officinalis and Alliaria officinalis. The abundance of Tragopogon 
pratense is quite unusual. On the left bank of the river here, about 
a mile above Portarlington, I gathered Campanula Trachelium, one 
of the rarest Irish plants, and found elsewhere only by the Nore in 
Kilkenny. There was not much of it here, where it occurs a few 
yards from the river on steep banks amongst brambles and under 
trees. With it occurred Uanunculus auricomus. The locality is 
near the point marked Barrow Bank House on the map. Easj)berry 
occurs along here, and nearer to Kilnahown Bridge Sium angusti- 
folia, Carex ronota, and C. sylvatica. Dogwood is also abundantly 
established. Here I gathered a sportive hose-in-hose Geum rivale, 
which produced a pretty effect. I was now in Garryhinch, a 
beautiful place, but subjected evidently to extensive inundations. 
Stagnant inlets and deep slime -pits abound near the water and 
amongst the trees, but the vegetation is most luxuriant, and here 
Scirpus sylvaticus grows in the greatest profusion with the Lysimachia, 
Thalictrum, and Myriophyllum already mentioned. Here, too, 
Aquilegia vidgaris occurs as a native. Rusa arvensis adorns these 
woods also, and a little past Garryhinch Leontodou hispidum is a 
prevalent weed. Towards Mountmellick I met ^Eyupudium Poda- 



14 THE BOTANY OF THE BAKROW. 

graria, Ribes Grossularia, Saponaria officinalis, Lychnis vesj)ertina, 
Knautia arvensis, Orifjcinuni vtih/are, and BromuH cownutatus again. 
I found clean and comfortable accommodation at the inn at Mount- 
mellick. 

On Thursday the 22nd June I drove to the eastern base of 
Clarnahinch Mountains, in the Slieve Blooms, and, having crossed 
the famous ridge of Capard, descended to the west at the head of 
Glenbarrow, where the river takes its rise. I crossed this sandstone 
ridge at about IGOO feet, and the mountain and upland plants 
noted were Habenaria cldoruntha, Equisetum sylvaticum, Juncus 
squarrosus, Carcx binervis, Nartlieciimi Ossifragum, Kmpetrum nigrum, 
Scirpus cicspitosns ; and, by the source of river, Antennaria dioica. A 
little down I met with Pyrm Aucuparia, Lycopodium Selago, Teucrium 
Scorodonia, Ajuga repens, Saruthamnus scoparius, Hieracium Pilosella, 
XJlex europaus, Carduus pratensis, Pinguicida vulgaris, and GratcBgus 
Oxyacantha, all above 1000 feet above sea-level. At about this 
height Draba verna and Betida vidgaris occurred by the river, and a 
little lower Fragaria vesca and Aspidium aculeatum appeared also. 
The upper limit of bracken [Pteris aqidlifia) was about 1051 feet, 
and between that and 950 feet were noticed Viburnum Opulus, 
Fraxinus excelsior, Epilobium montanuni , Corylus Avellana, Rosa tomen- 
tosa, Bunium Jiexuosum, Allium ursinum, Centaurea nigra, Scilla 
nutans. Orchis mascula, Qucrcus Robur, Carex ovalis, (J. fidva, and 
Listera ovata. Between 950 and 800 feet I noted Briza media, Rubus 
saxatilis, Asperxda odorata, Carlina vulgaris and Cystopteris fragilis. 

I have entered into some details here, as the subject of alti- 
tudinal range has occupied my attention much, and several of 
the above have not been recorded so high in Ireland elsewhere. 
The characteristic plants of this part of the Barrow, which occu- 
pies a wide stony bed between banks of sand and gravel, are 
Aspidium aculeaUmi and Antennaria dioica, which occur in unusual 
plenty. I was pleased to find also an abundant growth of 
Cystopteris fragilis ; a single plant somewhere in Carlow was not 
sufficient to entitle a fern to a place in the flora of District III. 
From this headquarters, the station on the Barrow Bridge at 
Monasterevan, which I subsequently verified, has been no doubt 
derived. This latter is the only one for District V. A little lower 
I met with Frigenm acris, Anthyllis Vidneraria, and Samolus Valerandi ; 
and here I was fairly out of the mountains. Eqmsetum^ maximum, 
Eupatorium cannabinum, Gymnadenia albida, and Carex pallescens 
occurred on the right bank a little above Tiunehinch Bridge. Here 
are wide gravel beds, which are frequently under water, and several 
plants of interest occur, as EJqidsetiim. variegatum, Lycopodium selagi- 
noides, Parnassia palustris, Ophrys apifera, Erythrcea Centaurium, 
Chlora  perfoliata, and Epipactis palustris. Past the bridge, Salix 
repens, Carex hirta, Juncus glaucus, I^oa rigida, Festuca sciuroides, 
Arenaria serpyllifolia, and Draba verna vary the ground, while 
Carlina and Antennaria are still abundant on the limestone gravel. 
The banks are enlivened along here by numbers of goldfinches ; it 
was delightful to see this scarce and diminishing species so common. 
Black-headed gulls also were of common occurrence. About a mile 



THE BOTANY OF THE BAEEOW. 15 

below Tinnehincli Bridge the river becomes somewhat satisfied 
witli its course, and flows between its banks. From the mountains 
to the bridge is a lake after floods. The Barrow now skirts the 
east edge of Monettia Bog, into which I made a slight detour. 
Curlew, golden plover, and gulls abounded. No plants of interest 
were seen, excepting Veronica ncutellata, but I made little way 
owing to the depth of the bog-holes. From this point a noticeable 
feature is Salix pentandra, which is, however, a questionable native. 
If it be introduced, it has now spread on to old bogs and unbroken 
ground in many places between this and Monasterevan, and I think 
it is very likely wrong to challenge it. I have little doubt it is 
native in Donegal, Derry, and Antrim. A more interesting species 
was, however, gathered here ; Carcx axillaris was discovered in its 
second Irish locality. Mr. More, who saw my specimen, states that 
a salt-marsh near Kinsale is the only other habitat whence he has 
seen the true plant. Sir J. Hooker gives his opinion that it is 
probably a hybrid between C retitota and either C. vtclpina or 
C'. miiricata. "When I gathered it I took it for granted it was 
a hybrid between C. remota and C. vuljrina, which both occurred 
with it. I had not previously seen the plant. In the water Pota- 
mogeton jjerfoliatns is common, and on its banks Kquisetum palustre 
occurred. Some of these plants may be deemed unworthy of 
notice, but the botany of this part of Ireland has hardly been 
touched. I noted Thrincia hirta, as well as Apargia hispida, here- 
abouts. This river works along through a plain, above which it 
flows between artificial banks, which it can tear down and flood 
when so disposed, and which make walking a villainous torture and 
botany a fraud. Viburnum Opuliis and Salix pentandra are the only 
objects of interest ; the former very pretty with its discs of white 
standing out above the foliage. Somewhere about Two-mile Bridge 
I got dreadfully entangled in hawthorn thickets, and saw Carex 
acuta, which afterwards becomes frequent a little below the bridge. 
Orchis Morio is very plentiful with commoner species, and along 
here Ehawnus catharticus is very common. Thalictrum majus and 
Scirfus syhaticus have their upper limit here. Adder's-tongue is 
remarkably common, and Bromus cummutatus frequent. I reached 
Mountmellick before dusk, glad to have accomplished what I 
feared I should not be able to do in a day. I had now done the 
river as far as Monasterevan ; it must be admitted in somewhat a 
rapid fashion, but river species have usually a lengthened extent, 
so that one is less likely to lose by rapidity than in other expeditions 
of the kind. If a species be skipped along the banks it is most 
probable it will give another chance lower down. 

Near Monasterevan the county boundaries of Kildare, King's 
County, and Queen's County are most confusing, being sometimes 
along the Barrow, sometimes along the FigileEiver, and occasionally 
scooping cantles from each other regardless of all order and of 
both rivers. 

On the 23rd June I made an excursion up the Black Kiver 
northwards from Monasterevan. This river is, I think, larger at 
this point than the Barrow, and is formed of three streams. Cushina,

Slate, and Figile rivers. In it I noticed Foa aquatica, Ranunculus 
Lingua, Potaningcton Iieterophyllus, P. lucens and P. rufescens (?), 
Sai/ittaria sagittifolia and Carex resicaria. The Black Eiver is here 
the boundary between District V. and VII. In fields near I noted 
CardmiH jjycnocephalus, not often seen so far from the coast. By 
the Grand Canal, which here complicates the geography still 
further, I gathered Potamor/eton densus, Q^nanthe PhelUmdrium var. 
tinciatilis (a frequent and undistinguishable form), and Carex 
vmricatd. By the Barrow, below Monasterevan, at Moore Abbey, 
ThaUctrum majus, Poa aquatica, and on the bridge Gystopteris 
//•rt//«7/s were observed. Carex vesicaria, C. acuta, Lysimachiainilgaris, 
Sparganiuin simplex, CEnanthe PlieUandrium, and Mgriophglhun verti- 
cillatum are frequent. After about two miles I gathered Nasturtitmi 
sglvestre, which was common in low wet meadows on the right 
bank. A single locality on the Suir and another on the Blackwater 
were its only known habitats in Ireland. It is plentiful along this 
part of the Barrow. N. pa lust re was also observed. Klodea 
canadensis occurs occasionally. "White water-lily first appears 
about here, appearing to like deeper and more stagnant water than 
its yellow relative. Carex stricta occurs also, and Rhamnus cathar- 
ticus commonly below Kiverstone House. I left the river for the 
day at Old Fort Bridge (Dunvally on the map). Since the imion 
of the Black Eiver the Barrow has become a goodly stream, but its 
course here is through a dull county for a considerable distance. 

On June 24th I kept the left bank from the Old Fort Bridge. 
There appeared to be two considerable tributaries on the right 
bank and only one on the left, but this one when I came to it was 
quite unnegotiable, a deep stagnant trough of mud, weeds and 
water, which I could neither wade, jump, nor swim. I was 
doubled back here to Cloney Bridge, and lost much time before I 
regained the Barrow. Prior to the Cloney I had noticed no new 
plants. Nasturtium amphibium, as well as the other two mentioned 
above were there, the N. sglvestre being frequent. Festuca arundi- 
nacea is also common. At this contumacious tributary I first saw 
Rumex Hydrolapathum, and in the extended swamp I had to cross to 
reach Cloney I3ridge I saw it in several places. Frequently I 
tried this treacherous stream, but had to desist. Carex paniculata 
and C. stricta were large and plentiful by its edges. The place was 
horrible, and, judging from the multitude of i-edshauks and wild 
duck, is seldom disturbed. Having at length got back to the 
Barrow, the great abundance of Poa aquatica was noticeable. It 
forms a wide fringe on either side continuously, almost throughout 
the greater part of its course, and it appears to be highly valuable, 
for cattle wade out as far as they dare to browse on it. A little 
before Athy I met with Stellaria glauca again, and on ditch banlvs 
leading down to the river ClicBrophylluni temulum was gathered in 
two or three places. At Athy C/tenopodium Bomis-Henricus occurs, 
and close by, along the towing-path below the town, Verbena 
officinalis, rare except in the south, and probably brought up by the 
traffic. 

From this point there is usually a tow-path belonging to the 



THE BOTANY OF THE BAEEOW. 17 

" Barrow Navigation Company " I believe, on one side or the other 
of the river, or along some canal close by. This objectionable and 
injurious construction has banished many interesting plants from 
its side of the Barrow, and limited my choice of walking con- 
siderably, as I was of course compelled to follow the side of the 
river where the path did not lie. Kind remarks were frequently 
addressed to me on the subject, but I paid them no attention. On 
excursions like this, if there is anything whatever to be gained 
by asking a peasant the way, it is to learn which way he 
considers impossible and the worst, and to choose that without 
a moment's hesitation. Below Athy I kept the right bank of 
the river in District III. GeraniiDii pyrenaicum and Stellaria 
glauca were seen and most of the larger river plants already 
mentioned. Myriophyllum spicatum was noticed, and the large 
dock has become abundant. At Kilmoroney Crepis paludusa and 
the white Lychnis were the only novelties. In consequence of 
my delay in the morning it was dusk when I reached Magauey 
Bridge, and I luckily caught a train to Carlow, where I slept that 
night. 

On the 25tli I drove out to Maganey. Between Carlow and 
Maganey I noted Orchis pyramidalis, Geranium pyrenaicum, Viola 
odorata, Lithospermum arvense, and Ch(BrophylLum teynuluin. From 
Maganey Bridge to Carlow Carex acuta, C. vesicaria, Thalictrwii, 
Poa, Lysimachia, Riimex, and Myriophyllum of the large river kinds, 
all occurred to Carlow. Sagittaria was seen in one place, and by 
Mark's Grange, Polygonum Bistorta is a common weed in an old 
meadow, with Orchis pyramidalis and Chlora perfoliata. About half- 
way between Maganey and Carlow I left Queen's County, and the 
Barrow lies entirely in Carlow and District III. At Shrule Castle 
I noticed Car ex muricata for the second time. Near Knockleg 
Stellaria glauca is common in a rushy field, and Nasturtium amphi- 
bium occurred again ; it had been absent for many miles. Potamo- 
geton perfoliatus and P. heterophyllus are common. Back to lunch 
at Carlow in afternoon. I noticed Avena Jiavescens close to the 
town. After Carlow I saw Sagittaria once more, and near Milford 
Stellaria glauca, Carex acuta, and the large Rumex. At Milford the 
Barrow begins to grow pretty, and its beauty here is much enhanced 
by the picturesque situation of some handsome mills amongst 
timber, by a lovely bridge with three high semicircular arches. 
On the bridge I noticed Sagiiia ciliata. There I crossed to the left 
bank to avoid the tow-path, and found in thickets Lycopus europceus. 
A little farther down was a wonderful display of yellow Iris in full 
flower. It formed an inland belt of about fifty yards for more than 
half a mile parallel to the river ; outside it an abundant growth of 
Caltha jyaliistris, a,t the water's edge and out as far as shallow Poa 
aquatica, and in the deep water Potamogeton lieterophyllus and Spar- 
ganium minimum form the predominant vegetation. About two and 
a half miles below Milford, on hedge-banks down the Barrow, I 
gathered Clmrophyllum temulum again, and in plenty about three- 
quarters of a mile from Leighliu Bridge. CEnanthe Phellandrium is 
always frequent. At Leighlin Bridge Senehiera didyma, Sambucus

Ebulus, and Anthriscus vulgaris occurred. A little below, a rare 
grass, Festuca loliacea, was met with in rich meadows near the 
water's edge, on the right bank : it is a form of F. pmtensis. 
Along here the river is lovely, winding along in bold sweeps 
in a richly wooded country. About a mile above Bagenals-town, 
where I stopped for the night, I gathered Stellaria rjlauca again, 
and opposite the village the great water dock [Humex llijdro- 
lapntliwii). 

On the 26th I followed the river by the right bank from Bagenals- 
town to New Eoss. A little way past Bagenals-town C/ucruphtjUiim 
temulum is abundant below the bridge. Lijsimachia vub/aris, Poa 
aquutica, Carex acuta, C paludosa, Myriophylliim verticillatum, and 
the Stellaria and Rhdwx above mentioned occurred to Gores Bridge. 
Between Gores Bridge and Ballytegelea Bridge Thalictrum majiis, 
Malva moschata, Euonymus europcRus, may be mentioned, and past the 
bridge Nasturtium amphibium and N. sylvestre were seen again. 
Here I passed through Borris demesne, still keeping the right 
bank. In the woods by the water's edge the interesting species were 
Crepis paludosa, (Fnanthe crocata, and Milium efusum. In these 
woods were a number of jays, which are scarce birds in Ireland. 
A little below Borris I gathered in a thicket Carex hdvigata, Habcnaria 
chlorantha ; Carex fiilva and Rumex and Stellaria still occur. Thalic- 
trum majus also turned up again, and here for the first time along 
the Barrow Scrophularia aquatica appeared. At Graigueuamanagh, 
on the river wall on the right bank, Hieracium sahaudum grows. 
Here I rested for afternoon tea, and following the same bank I 
came in for some very severe work, especially along the wooded 
cliffs opposite St. Mullins. The tide reaches as far as St. MuUins 
and some species speedily disappear or keep well above the bed of 
the stream. In the water, however, (Fnanthe Phellandrium, Alisma 
Plavtaijo, and Poa aquatica still hold their own. (Fnanthe crocata 
becomes more abundant, as does also Elodea cafiadensis, since the 
water is more stagnant. The first salt-marsh plant to appear is 
Scirpus maritimus. Lower down Carex riparia is very abundant. 
In the thicket opposite St. Mullins Carex pendula and Milium 
efusum both grow, the former beautiful species being very thinly 
distributed in Ireland. The later part of this days' work was done 
in the dusk, and somewhere about Carranvor I had to leave the 
river and got completely bewildered as to my whereabouts, so that 
I have little to say about the vegetation of the lower reaches, which 
are of the nature of an estuary. Just here the Nore flows in, and 
at New Ross the two streams in union form a glorious prospect. 
Near New Ross I observed Fchium. vuhjare, Dipsacus sijlcestris, and 
Scrophularia aquatica, along the road to Waterford. The remainder 
of this herborization belongs to my report on the Cummeragh 
Mountains.

SHORT NOTES. 

A New Sparganium. — lu October, 188B, I observed at Albury 
Ponds, near Guildford, a Span/anium resembling S. rcwioswn 
Huds. in habit, but differing from it in the partially mature fruits 
which were ail that the very depauperate specimens afforded. This 
led to investigation during the past year, with the result that I find 
the plant, which I propose to call S. vei/Iectiun, plentiful in various 
parts of Surrey. The chief distinctive characters are found in the 
fruit, which is somewhat obovate-acuminate, with a long beak, 
instead of, as in ramosum, obversely conical, with a very truncate 
(or sometimes rounded) apex and short beak. Eeichenbach's 
plate (Icon. Fl. Ger. 751) of S. erectum would seem to have been 
drawn from the present plant rather than from S. ramosum Huds., 
which, however, is given as a synonym ; and in Leighton's ' Flora 
of Shropshire ' the fruit of nei/lectum is described as that of 
ramosum, suggesting that the former may be the common form in 
that county, I am, however, unable to find that the plants have 
ever been separated. In Surrey S. nq/lectiivi occurs in the basins 
of the Rivers Blackwater, Wey, Mole, and Arun ; it thins out, 
however, towards the east, and I have not observed it in the 
Medway basin ; also Mr. Alfred Fryer sends various gatherings of 
good ramosum from, the fens of Hunts and Cambs., but after 
" exploring many miles of Sjiarf/anium-fiiled ditches," is unable to 
find the subject of this note, which may therefore possibly prove 
absent from some of the eastern counties. It is almost certain to 
be found in Sussex and Hants (and doubtless elsewhere), as it 
occurs close to the borders of the counties named, by streams 
flowing into them from Surrey. — W. H. Beeby.

Revs. H. E. Fox and E. F. Linton. I fear, however, that plant is

not indigenous in this locality, as, unless my memory deceives me, 
I was told by a horticultural Mend that he had sown a quantity of 
the seed — derived from cultivated Ben Lawers plants — along with 
the seeds of other alpines, in Canlochan. One result of this was 
the discovery there, by some members of the Edinburgh Botanical 
Society, in 1880, Myosotis aJpcstris var. Krinus alpinns, Primula 
Auricula, and other aliens. I quite believe that my friend was in 
no degree aware of the reprehensibility of his proceedings, or that 
if his name was revealed it would be held in execration by all 
British botanists. I am sorry to say that he also sowed (unless I 
am mistaken) the seeds of various alpines on Ben Lawers, but so 
far as I can learn none of these have been found on that hill. In 
hope that none of the plants thus sown would have established 
themselves, I did not mean to put the fact formally on record ; but 
now that Myosotis rupicola has been actually recorded, it seems 
necessary to mention it. There is, however, one consolation for 
botanists, and that is that I believe all the seeds sown were of those 
plants which from their showy flowers are in common cultivation, 
and hence that no obscure-flowered species, as grasses, carices, &c., 
if discovered hereafter in these localities, need be looked upon with 
suspicion. — F. Buchanan White.

November 6, 1884. — Sir John Lubbock, Bart., President, in the 
chair. — A letter was read, intimating that the late President, 
Mr. George Beutham, had bequeathed by his will a legacy of £1000 
to the Society. — Mr. W. T. T. Dyer exhibited the following plants and 
their products : — (1) Vaccinium ArctostajJiylos, from which the 
Trebizonde Tea (" Tlie-du-Bn-Dagh ") is prepared at Amassia and 
Tokat ; (2) Pueraria Thunbergiana from Corea, and the cloth made 
from it; (3) Pachyrhiza sinensis ("Ko-poo"), from the fibres 
of which the yellow and more expensive cloth is made ; (4) Den- 
drohium Phahrnopsis Fitz., a coloured drawing from a plant obtained 
by Mr. H. 0. Forbes, in Timor Laut. — -Mr. E. A. Eolfe afterwards 
exhibited examples of British oak-galls produced by cynipidean 
insects of the genus Neuroterus. These were : — (1) The silk button 



LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON. 29 

gall produced by N. numismatis, exceptionally rare this season, 
and found on the common English oak, Quercus Ilohur, and on Q. 
lusitanica, Q. infectoria, and Q. Tnrneri; (2) the globose gall, pro- 
duced by N. ostreus, and got on Q. Rohur and Q. infectoria, on the 
leaves of which trees it is confined to the midrib on principal veins ; 
(3) the smooth spangle gall, of a greenish white or rose colour, 
flattish or saucer-shaped, destitute of hairs, produced by Xemoterus 
fiDnipemiis, and got on Q. Rohur and Q. lusitanica ; (4) the pale 
yellowish green scarce spangle gall, produced by N. laiviuscitlus, and 
only got by Mr. Eolfe on the common oak ; (5) the common 
spangle gall, produced by N. lenticiilaris, and found not only on Q. 
Rohur, but also on Q. Farnetto, Q. Toza, Q. lusitanica, Q. infecturia 
and Q. clentata, the latter a Japanese oak. There was also shown 
a remarkable blackish purple common gall, found on a variety ot 
the common oak, Q. Rohur var. Granhyana. This variety of the oak 
has deep purple leaves, but not so deep as in the var. purpurea, a 
fact demonstrating that the colour of the gall depends considerably 
on the oak leaves and not entirely on the insect producer. As a 
rule, the plan and details of the gall depend on the gall maker and 
the nature of the irritating fluid deposited by the insect, the gall 
itself merely representing the effort of the plant to remedy the 
injury done. That the character of the gall is determined at the 
time the egg is laid may be inferred from the circumstance that 
when the larva is destroyed by parasites, at the very earliest stage 
of gall development, the nature of the gall is not changed, though 
occasionally dwarfed. The galls found on the different species of 
oak above mentioned are all perfectly distinct from each other and 
from that of Quercus Rohur. — The next communication was on a col- 
lection of plants made in Timor Laut, by Henry 0. Forbes. Therein 
a short account is given of the nature of the islands and the general 
character of the vegetation, after which follows a list of about 80 
plants. Professor Oliver adds a note, that this collection, so far as 
it goes, is made up in great part of the more widely diffused species 
of the Indian Archipelago. The most interesting plants appear to 
be, one in fruit only, referred to the meliaceous genus (Jwenia, 
probably O. cerasifera, Muell., of Queensland; a fine Mucuna of the 
section Stizolohium ; Delarhrea, an araliaceous genus hitherto only 
received from New Caledonia ; and a fruit of possibly a Strombosia. 
Mr. Forbes is inclined to regard the Timor Laut flora and fauna as 
having affinities with the Moluccan (Amboina) region. — There 
followed a note on the reproduction of the heteroecismal Urediues, 
by Chas. B. Plowright. The author affirms that when the repro- 
duction of these fungi takes place without the intervention of 
ascidiospores, the resulting uredospores are far more abundant 
than in the case when they arise from the implantation upon the 
host-plant of the ascidiospores, this inference being supported by 
various detailed observations of the author. 

November 20. — Professor P. Martin Duncan, F.E.S., Vice Presi- 
dent, in the chair. — Mr. A. Roope Hunt was elected a Fellow of the 
Society. Mr. Francis B. Forbes drew attention to specimens 
of pods and seeds used by the Chinese in the place of soap. Ho

stated that for ordinary detergent purposes, an impure earthy soda 
and a lye made from ashes are employed. The leaves of llibiscus 
syridcHs and Giiujko biloha are occasionally used for cleansing the 
head. The most favourite substance, however, seems to be the 
fruit of certain Lei/uminosa, chiefly what the Chinese call " fei- 
tsao-tow " (fat black beans). Breitschneider has no doubt that this 
belongs to the Gymnocladns chincnsis, a plant originally described 
by Baillon only from pods received from Shanghai, and of which 
the leaves and flowers were for a long time unknown. There is 
now a specimen at Kew, from Foochow in the province of Fokien, 
with fruit and flowers, but only young leaves, which have been 
lately figured in the ' Icones Plantarum.' The specimens were 
exhibited with fruits and fully developed leaves, from Ningpo in 
Cheidang, and Wa-hu in Au-whei province. The pods of Gle- 
ditschia sinensis of Lamarck, called by the Chinese " tsao-chio," are 
used for the same purposes as those of the Gi/nmocladiis. The 
specimens now exhibited are fi'om Peking and the Shanghai 
district. One of them, which Mr. Forbes had always supposed to 
be Gleditschia sinensis, appears to come from the same tree as the 
type specimen of G. xylocarpa Hance. A tree common in South 
China was referred by Mr. Bentham, in the ' Flora Hongkongensis,' 
to G. sinensis, but the flowers and fruits of this specimen, lately 
examined at Kew and the British Museum, seem to differ from the 
northern ones. Lamarck founded his species on a tree growing in 
the Jardin des Plantes, from seeds sent from Peking by Pere Incar- 
ville 200 years ago ; and further inquiry seems needed as to the 
identity of the northern and southern plants. The Gymnocladus ' 
pods are said by Dr. Porter Smith to be roasted and kneaded into 
balls as large as childrens' marbles, when they are used in washing 
clothes and in bathing, but on account of their unpleasant smell 
they are not allowed in the public baths. The seeds are used in 
Peking by women in washing the head and hair. In Shanghai the 
Gleditschia pods are broken in small bits and soaked in boiling 
water, until a considerable amount of oily substance is floated, 
when the water is ready for use. The specimen exhibited of 
Sapindus niakwinsi, Gaert., was received from Mr. Clement Allen, 
British Consul at Ningpo, who stated that the Chinese there used 
the fruit as soap. This is doubtless the " Soap tree," or " Frei- 
chu-tszo," mentioned by Dr. Porter Smith. — Mr. H. Groves 
exhibited specimens of — (1) Cham connicens, collected at Slapton, 
S. Devon, the only known British slation, for no trace of the plant is 
now to be found at Stokes Bay ; (2) Chara canescens (with the syno- 
nym C. crinita), from a pool between Helston and the Lizard, and 
from Little Sea, Studland, Dorset. — Mr. Geo. Murray exhibited 
specimens, both dried and moistened, of a species of Glceocapsa 
found by Mr. Pryer, in bird's nest caves in North Borneo ; Mr. Murray 
also mentioned that he himself had found somewhat similar dried 
patches of Algae [Glaocapsa''- in leaves in Scotland, inhabited by 
pigeons. — Mr. W. T. T. Dyer showed and made remarks on some 
sterile runners of Mentha piperita, and the remains of flowers of 
Epiluhium hirsutum, taken from a wreath found by Prof. Maspero 



LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON. 31 

in a tomb near Thebes, and supposed to be of the 20th or 26th 
Dynasty ; he also showed some fresh flowers of Ipomea purpureo- 
candea. — A paper was read by Mr. E. M. Holmes, on Cinchona 
Ledt/eriana as a species. The author expressed the opinion that 
under the name of Cinchona Ledijeriana a number of varieties or 
forms, and probably some hybrids of Cinchona Calimija are now 
under cultivation in the British colonies. He believed that if 
more attention were paid to the characters afforded by the Ijark of 
the trees, taken in conjunction with the other botanical characters 
of flower and fruit, these varieties and hybrids Avould be more 
easily defined and recognised. He considers that the plant pub- 
lished under the name of Cinchona Ledgeriana by Dr. Trimen was 
probably referable to Weddell's Cinchona Calisaya var. pallida 
as a horticultural form, for which the author proposed the name 
Trimeniana. — Mr, E. T. Druery read a paper on a singular mode 
of reproduction in Athyrium Filicc-fcemina var. clarissima. In a 
previous paper the author had shown that prothallia bearing 
antheridia and archegonia were developed on the apex of pear- 
shaped bodies with the larger end downward, in the place usually 
occupied by sori. In the present paper he brought forward evidence 
to show that these pear-shaped bodies were not developed from 
sporangia, but from a previous formation of thread-like bodies, a 
few of which became thickened and developed into the pear-shaped 
bodies previously mentioned, the others remaining starved and un- 
developed. 

December 4. — William Carruthers, F.E.S., Vice-President, in 
the chair. — The following gentlemen were elected Fellows of the 
Society: — the Hon. F. 0. Dobson, LL.D., of Victoria, Australia; 
William A. Haswell, M.A., of Sydney, New South Wales; George 
W. Olfield, of London ; Dr. Geo. W. Parker, of Honolulu ; Michael 
C. Potter, M.A., of Cambridge, Vet. Surg.; Thos. J. Symonds, of 
the Madras Presidency; W. A. Talbot, of Yellowpore, Bombay; 
and J. H. Tompson, of Melbourne, Australia. — Mr. W. T. Tliisel- 
ton Dyer exhibited — (1) Examples of leaves of Sagittaria nionte- 
vidensis under different modes of cultivation ; the changes thus 
induced as regards size and general facies being most remark- 
able, so much so that they might be deemed widely separate 
genera. The small leaves were from a plant raised from seeds 
collected in Chili by Mr. J. Ball, and sent to Kew in 1883, and 
grown in a pot half submerged in the Nympha'a tank. The 
enormously large leaf and spike were those of a plant raised from 
seeds ripened at Kew and sown in spring (1884). When strong 
enough the plant was planted in a bed of muddy soil, kept 
saturated by means of a pipe running from the bed to the yymjdia-a 
tank. (2) A special and peculiar instrument called a " ladanis- 
terion," from Crete, it being a kind of double rake with leathern 
thongs instead of teeth, and used in the collecting of gum-

Trees and Protoplasmic Continuity," was read.

Society: — Lieut-Col. W. E, Lewis, Dr. Chas. B. Plowright, Messrs. 
T. B. Blow, H. G. Greenish, A. G. Howard, Lionel de Niceville, 
and F. Shrivell. — Mr. H. Ling Roth showed some roots of sugar- 
cane grown in Queensland and preserved in spirit, and from which 
he infers that the plant possesses two sorts, viz., ordinary matted 
fihrous roots, and others of a supposed special kind. The new 
Sparganium, a note on which appears on page 26, was exhibited 
by Mr. W. H. Beeby. Mr. Baker expressed his opinion that the 
plant was undoubtedly distinct from all described species. — Mr. W. 
T. T. Dyer exhibited life-size photographs of cones of two species 
of Encephalartos from South Africa, viz., R. loiif/if alius and E. 
latifrom, neither hitherto figured in European books. He also 
showed tubers of Ullucus tuberosus from Venezuela, which though 
esteemed as an esculent in South America, proved inedible when 
grown at Kew. — A paper was read by Mr. Henry 0. Forbes, " On 
Contrivances for ensuring Self-fertilization in some Tropical 
Orchids." In this paper the author referred to some Portuguese 
and other European orchids, and thereafter he described in detail 
the structural peculiarities of certain tropical OrchidacecB, which had 
been made the subject of study by him under favourable auspices. 
He arrives at the conclusion that a number of orchids are not 
fertilized by insects, but are so constructed as to enable them to 
fertilize themselves. This paper was illustrated by diagrams, 
referring more particularly to such forms as Phajus Blumei, Spatho- 
glottis 2)licaU(, Anmdina speciosa, Eria javensis, and genera allied to 
Chrysoglossum. — Mr. F. 0. Bower read a paper " On Apospory in 
Ferns," this having special reference to Mr. Chas. T. Druery's 
observations " On Athyrium Filix-fcemina var. darissima," pre- 
viously communicated to the Society. Mr. Bower's researches, 
made on the microscopical investigation and growth of sporophore 
generation to the prothallus, without the intervention of spores, 
confirms the statements of Mr. Druery. He finds, moreover, the 
case in point to hold good in certain other ferns — for example, in 
Poli/stichnm angulare, where there is the formation of an expansion 
of undoubted prothalloid nature, bearing sexual organs by a process 
of purely vegetative outgrowth from the fern plant ; that is, there 
is a transition from the sporophore generation to the oospore by a 
vegetable growth, and without any connection either with spores or 
indeed with sporangia or sori. The author goes on to point out 
the bearing of these observations and experiments on the general 
life-history of the fern, so far as the modifications of the genetic 
cycle are concerned, and further compares this new phenomenon of 
"apospory" in ferns with similar cases in other plants, while 
insisting on the importance of the cases at issue. — A communica- 
tion " On the aerial and submerged leaves of Ranunculus Lingua L.," 
was read by Mr. Freeman Roper. He shows from specimens 
obtained near Eastbourne, that the two sets of leaves in question 
differ so materially that they might not be suspected to belong to 
the same plant, the submerged being relatively much larger, 
greatly broader, ovate or cordate, and possessing abundance of 
stomata.

ON SOME NEW AND EARE DESMIBIEM. No. III. 

By W. Joshua, F.L.S.* 

(Tab. 254.) 

The following new and little-known species have recently 
occurred in collections received from foreign correspondents. The 
plate and description of No. 1 I take from the valuable published 
series of Algte of Messrs. Wittrock and Nordstedt. This small 
FAMstrwii was collected from Sphagna;, by J. Hart, Esq., in the 
Blue Mountains, Jamaica. 

My first acquaintance with Canadian DesmidiecB, from a collection 
forwarded in the past summer by the kindness of Mr. A. H. McKay, 
has brought to light a very distinct and beautiful new form of an 
old friend, Kuastnim remicosum Ehrenb. ; also Closterium Braunii 
Reinsch, Staurastrum polytrichum Perty f. major, S. lunatum Ralfs, 
Cosmarium TurpiniBveh, fi. LundeUii, Staurastrum orbicidare (Ehrb.) 
Ralfs. f. 7» mo?- Nordst., Cosmarium Qnasillus Lund., C. Botrytisft. sub- 
tumidum Witivv . , Hyalotheca dissiliens f. tridentula'^oi'dst.,Micrasterias 
americana Ralfs. (cytioderm spinulose), Staurastrum polymorplium 
(four-rayed), C. crenatum Ralfs. f. hicrenatum Nordst., C. Cordanum 
Breb. = Colpopelta viridis Corda, Xanthidium antilopeum new var- 
canadense (a stout form with side spines in centre of semi-cell). 

The new species from Rangoon are from a large collection, at 
present under examination, received from Dr. Romanis. 

Penium spinospernuDii (Journ. Bot. 1883, 293) was collected by 
the Rev. H. W. Lett of Ardmore, Lurgan ; these zygospores much 
resemble those of C. glohosmn Bulnh. No. 11, with its singular 
spore, is a somewhat rare species, new to this country. The 
drawings are made from specimens taken by me in the neighbour- 
hood of Cirencester. I may here mention the valuable addition to 
our Desmid literature, entitled ' Desmids of the United States,' by 
the Rev. F. Wolle, which has recently appeared in America, and 
would be a decided boon to any student of this class. It is replete 
with a large amount of original information and excellent coloured 
plates. Among the eleven hundred species figured, a vast number 
will be recognised as having a home in this country.

This Carex belongs to the Bengaleusis section, with some 
affinity to 0. baccans Nees. It lias a close tuft of rough stiff 
recurved leaves, from which springs a short stout culm, bearing a 
somewhat compact panicle. The spikelets are about an inch in 
length and slender ; they are borne on long peduncles, which are 
for the most part concealed in the swollen vaginre of the culm 
leaves, from the axils of which the spikelets spring. The laminse 
of these leaves resemble those of the radical leaves ; the lower 
ones are three inches in length. The lower spikelets are all female, 
the males being few in number in the upper part of the panicle. 
The narrow long-beaked utricles, when ripe, are excurved, almost 
black, the beak shortly notched, scabrid. The length of the mucro 
of the glume varies very much. 



NOTES ON MIDDLESEX PLANTS. 
By John Benbow. 

A BRIEF notice of some plants gathered during the past summer 
in the north-western districts of the county may be of interest, 
although the ground covered has been too well worked to yield a 
very rich harvest. My gleanings, however, show that many species 
find no place in the ' Flora of Middlesex' for these districts. The 
search, moreover, has proved the absence of plants in numerous 
localities where they are stated to grow "abundantly."' Eecords 
from stations of limited, well-defined areas are in the majority of 
instances obsolete, and might well be placed within excluding 
brackets. The following list — supplementary to several previous 
notes — includes a few only of the species thus omitted, or gathered 
in new stations : — 

Kanunciiliis circinatiis. In many places from Southall to Hare- 
field. 

Senebiera didyma. Gravel-jpits, Dawley, near Hayes. 

Reseda lutea. Said to grow "only in Haretield chalk-i)its " ; is 
common about Springwell ; grows sparingly on a gravelly bank 
skirting Uxbridge Common, and in a meadow near Jack's Lock. 

Silene nuctijiora. West Drayton. 

SteUaria (jlnuca. Staines Moor (in addition to previous record 
of "Moor north of Uxbridge"). 

Malva burealis. Near Uxbridge. 

Geranium lucidum. Cowley. 

lUuoiinus catharticHS. Said to grow "near Harefield, but just 
out of Middlesex"; is to be found in a meadow south of Harefield. 

LotuH tenuiti. In great profusion for a milo or two on railway- 
banks between Uxbridge and West Drayton. 



NOTES ON MIDDLESEX PLANTS. 37 

Pyriis Aria. Several fine trees skirt Old Park Wood on the 
north, — P. torminalis. Eecorded as "just out of the county, in 
Herts"; is to be found sparingly in hedgerows about Harefield. 

Epilobium macrocarpum. Very abundant in swampy copses from 
Uxbridge Common and Swakeleys to Ickenham. — K. ruseum. 
Ditch by Warren Pond, Breakspeares ; and Old Park Wood. — 
E. pnlustre. Bog close to Moor Hall. 

Mi/riophi/llum verticiUatum. Uxbridge Moor, Harefield Moor , 
and elsewhere. 

CJinjsospJenimn oppositifoJinm. In a boggy corner of Old Park 
Wood, abundantly. 

Torilis nodosa. On a sandy bank, Uxbridge Moor. 

Galium Cruciata. Apparently very scarce ; I have met with 
only a single plant in Long Lane, Hillingdon. 

Dipsacus pilosus. Plentiful in a copse, and on banks near Den- 
ham Lock ; Harefield Eoad, near Moor Hall. 

Inula Helenium. Several plants in a wet meadow near North- 
wood (extinct in Blackstone's stations). — I. Conyza. Several 
plants in an old pit in the meadow between Jack's Lock and the 
Copper Mills (extinct in the "old chalk-pit" as recorded by Black- 
stone). 

Pulicaria vuhjans. On the west side of Staines Common, close 
to the London Eoad, plentifully. (Cannot find this in any of the 
stations recorded). 

Serratula tinctoria. This also seems very scarce ; I have met 
with it only at Pole Hill, Hillingdon. 

Centaurea solstitialis. Two or three plants in fields above 
Uxbridge (introduced). 

Carduus tenuijiorus. Staines Moor. 

Gentiana AmareUa. This species, with Campanula TracheUum 
and Chlora perfoliata, appears to extend over a wider area than 
supposed ; it grows by the side of an old pit at Springwell ; 
abundantly on the steep slopes of the down beyond, and sparingly 
on chalky banks to the boundary. 

Villarsia nymphccoidos. Grows higher up the Thames than Wal- 
ton Bridge. 

Cuscuta Trifolii. Very abundant in clover-fields about Springwell. 

EcMiim vuigare. In the same fields. 

Lithospervmm arvense. About Colnbrook. 

Hyoscyavms niger. Near Uxbridge Common. (Grew lately near 
Cowley, on waste ground by the Colne, but now extinct). 

Mentha yentilis. In some quantity in the marshy bottom of a 
heathy waste near Northwood. (Mr. Arthur Bennett has kindly 
named this plant). 

Calamintha officinalis. In several places about Harefield, and 
evidently — as suggested by the authors of the ' Flora of Middlesex ' 
— the var. Briggsii. — C. Acinos. Mr. Newbould's record of "a 
single specimen in the old chalk-pit, Harefield" is somewhat 
misleading : it grows there plentifully, and is a troublesome weed 
in the fields above. 

Nepeta Cataria. About Harefield, in several places, sparingly. 



38 LORANTHI SPECIEM NOVAM CHINENSEM. 

Lmnium incisum. Pottery-field on Uxbridge Common. 

Anai/tillis arvensis var. acrulea. Two plants in a field by Ux- 
bridge Common. 

EiDiicx vuiritimus and R. palustris. A few plants of each species 
still hold their ground this summer ; but the swamp is now filled 
up, and rows of cottages built upon the site. 

FritiUaria Mclrafjn's. Several patches in Swakeley's Park, near 
Uxbridge, but fast being rooted up for garden -culture. 

Putamof/eton rufescens. Abundant in ditches from junction of 
canal and river to Springwell Lock ; also sparingly in a ditch close 
to Denham Fishery, — P. mucronatm. Canal between Denham 
and Moor Locks, and in old docks at Southall, plentifully. (Both 
these pondweeds have been verified by Mr. Arthur Bennett). Other 
species, though common in the district, are omitted in the ' Flora 
of Middlesex, viz., P. Incens, P. jmsillus, and P. JiaheUatua. 

ScirpHs jhutans. Pond by the Lodge leading to Swakeley's 
Park from Uxbridge Common (not on Harefield Common). 

Carex palicaris. Wet meadow near Bayhurst Wood. — C. 
disticha. Not uncommon. — C. paniculata. This sedge, quite 
common in District 1, is omitted from 1, 2, and 3. It is very 
abundant from Uxbridge to Harefield, by sides of river, canal, and 
ditches adjoining. — C. axillaris. Plentiful in a lane east of Ux- 
bridge Common ; sparingly in lanes about Blackenbury Farm, 
Ickenham Green, West Drayton, &c. — G. stellulata. Moor below 
Dew's Farm ; by pond on Duck's Hil] Farm, Northwood. — C. 
pallescens. Abundant in a wet meadow by Bayhurst Wood. — 
C. striyosa. Old Park AVood. — C. pendula. Eastcott and district. 
— C. piluli/era. Lane near Pinner Station (not on Harefield 
Common. — C. fiava. Moor below Dew's Farm ; side of pond on 
Duck's Hill Farm, Northwood. — C. hinervis. Harefield Common, 
sparingly (not on Paiislip Common). — C. Pseudo-cypenis. Hare- 
field Moor, very sparingly. 

Triticum canimun. Plentiful in places on the wide hedge-banks 
between Dew's Farm and Moor Hall. 

Nitella translucens. Ruislip Reservoir. 

On reference to the table of " comparison with adjacent counties" 
appended to the ' Flora of Middlesex ' it will be seen that four of 
the species found last summer are there said to be "wanting" in 
the county, viz., Avaijallis arvensis var. aerulea, Centaurca solstitialis, 
Crepis hiemris, and PotaiiKu/etun rufescens ; whilst Sisi/mbrium Sophia, 
Mentha (jentilis, and Ojdinjs apij'era are excluded from the 'Flora' as 
extincts.

A CONTEIBUTION TOWAEDS A FLOEA OF 

BEECONSHIEE. 

By W. Bowles Barrett, F.L.S. 

There are still two or three Welsh couuties the flora of which 
is comparatively little known. Amongst such, Breconshire (County 
42), held, till quite lately, a prominent place, passing almost un- 
noticed in ' Topographical Botany,' ed. ii. This fact led me to 
visit the county in August last, and I spent the closing three weeks 
of that mouth in examining the Breconshire flora. 

I believe that, at the date of my visit, the total number of 
species actually recorded for the county amounted to 356 only ; for 
the larger number of these we were indebted to the Eev. Augustin 
Ley, M.A., who had made several botanical visits there between 
1873 and 1883, and who has an intimate acquaintance with the 
botany of the Black Mountain district. Of the 356 species referred 
to, only 186 appeared in the 2nd edition of ' Topographical 
Botany,' 140 additional species were recorded by Mr. Ley, in the 
Eeport of the Botanical Eecord Club for 1881, and 22 were added by 
Miss Fryer in April last ( Journ.Bot. 1884, p. 124). A further hst was 
published in December last, in the Eeport of the Botanical Eecord 
Club for 1883, of 129 new county records of plants observed by Mr. 
Ley in that year; 105 additional new records for the county, of so- 
callled " species," and 24 of segregates and varieties, Avere made by 
me in August last, and are embodied in this paper. Mr. Ley and 
Mr. H. N. Eidley, F.L.S. , have obligingly communicated the 
name's of eight additional species, either observed by them, or 
specimens of which are preserved in the Brit. Mus. Herb. The 
present census of Breconshire plants is thus brought up to 590 
species. 

By far the larger portion of the county consists of old red 
saudstone, which is distinguished from that forming the subsoil of 
Herefordshire chiefly by its extraordinary elevation. The upper 
portion of this formation, consisting of sandstone and conglo- 
merate, occupies the summits of the Vans (Beacons), and other 
lofty mountains, presenting some of the grandest exhibitiuus of the

occupy the extreme north of Brecoushire. The coal and iron 
tract comprises a narrow district along the whole southern side of 
the county. The western side is distinguished by greywacke 
slates. The transition rocks are singularly devoid of limestone. 
The county, in its general character, is distinguished by its ex- 
tensive valleys and continuous and lofty mountain tracts. Only 
about two-thirds of it are under cultivation ; the southern portion 
is especially wild and elevated. A semicircular range of moun- 
tains, compiising the Black Mountain group on the east, the 
Brecon Beacons towards the south-west, and Mount Capellante 
and the Brecoushire Van towards the west, attain altitudes of from 
2500 feet or thereabouts to 2862 feet, while a long barren chain, 
called Mynydd Epynt, stretches across the county in a north- 
easterly direction, between Trecastle and Builth. The annual 
rainfall is large, especially in the mountain regions ; it may be 
averaged, throughout the county, at about forty inches. The 
rivers are very numerous, each large stream possessing many 
tributaries. 

The almost tropical heat, at the time of my visit, forbad much 
mountain work; moreover, the extraordinary drought had rendered 
the hills comparatively bare. For the most part, therefore, my 
excursions were made in the basins of the Tawe, Taff-Vechan, 
Khymney, Usk, Llynvi, Wye, and Irvon rivers, and around Llan- 
gorse Lake. 

The flora of Brecoushire is semi-montane in character, but, in 
consequence of the inland position of the county, the uniformity 
of soil, and the large tracts forming elevated moors or mountain 
ranges where the sm-face is still in a state of nature, the flora is by 
no means rich or varied. Many plants, frequent in most parts of 
England, seem here to be scarce or absent, points to which I have 
drawn attention in the following list. It is not unlikely that 
hereafter the flowering plants and ferns of the county may be 
brought up to about 670 ; that number, however, is small for a 
county 35 miles in length, with a breadth of 20 miles, and a surface 
presenting such great variations in altitude. 

The most interesting ground to the botanist is to be found on 
the Brecon Beacons, in the Black Mountain district, the neighbour- 
hood of Pen-y-wyllt, the shores of Llangorse Lake, and the 
Khymney Valley, Among the rarer plants of the Brecon Beacons 
are Thaiictrum moiitanmn, Caltha minor, Cerastium alpestre, Alsine 
verna, Sediim lihuiiiola, S. Forsterianum, Saxifnuja oppositifolia, 
Hi/i)i('no]/hijUum Wilsoni, and Asplenium viride. In the Black 
Mountain district are found Meconopsis Camhrica, Viola lutea, 
Geranium st/lraticuni, Fi/nis rajdcola, Saxifruga Hpunhemica, S. hyp- 
noides, ]\lyrrhis odorata, Hicraciwn prena}itJwides, Vacciniiim Vitis- 
idfca, (Jystopteris dentata, rolypodium rheyopteria, P. Dryopteris, 
P. Piohertianum, and Lycopodiiiiii aljiimiiii. 

I have collected in this paper all the records known to me of 
Brecoushire plants, hoping that thereby some little additional light 
may be thrown on plant distribution over the extensive inland

I am greatly indebted to the Eev. A. Ley, who has most kindly 
allowed me to incorporate his extended observations with my own, 
and has communicated much valuable information relating to the 
botany of the county. My grateful acknowledgments are also due 
to Mr. J. G. Baker, F.E.S., the Eev. W. W. Newbould, F.L.S., and 
the Eev. W. Moyle Eogers, F.L.S., for kind assistance in iden- 
tifying some critical plants. I am responsible for all the plants 
and stations against which no authority is attached. The nomen- 
clature of the 7tli edition of the London Catalogue has been 
adopted in this paper. Those plants which are new records for the 
county, in tlie sense of not having been recorded either in ' Topo- 
graphical Botany,' or in either of the lists before alluded to, are 
distinguished by the prefixed asterisk ; C stands for common, F for 
frequent.

SHOET NOTES. 

A Correction. — The Potamor/eton of the Eiver Barrow, which I 
named douhtfuUy P. rufescens (ante, p. 12), is determined by Mr. 
Arthur Bennett (to whom I sent specimens) to be P. odteym Web., 
var. latifulins Fr. P. nitem must be a very variable phmt, as Mr, 
Bennett tehs me he has no fewer than twenty- six forms in his 
herbarium. — H. C. Hart. 

Lysimachia ciliata in North Wales. — I found this plant last 
September, among some bushes at the western end of a small lake 
(the easternmost of two), near Afon-Wen, not far from the railway- 
station. Mr. Baker has seen my specimens. — H. C. Levinge. 

Carex aquatilis in Ireland. — AVe have still another instance of 
a high northern plant occurring at a low level in Ireland. Whilst 
doing the required field-work to enable me to make a report to the 
Eoyal Irish Academy, on the botany of Lough Allen, a sedge was 
met with whose aspect differed from anything I had hitherto seen, 
and which I thought, at the time, might be a variety of C. stricta. 
Subsequently it was named by a Continental authority as C. acuta 
var. gracilis Uechtritz. A specimen was sent to Mr. Bennett, of 
Croydon, and that gentleman, with his usual acuteness, saw cause 
to be dissatisfied with the name attached, and sent the plant to 
Sweden, to be compared with specimens in Fries's herbarium. 
Dr. Almquist, who made the comparison, reports that our sedge is 
not C. (/racilis, but C. aquatilis Wahl. In attempting to place my 
plant under C. stricta, or C acuta, I had never taken C. aquatilis 
into consideration, as, for geographical reasons, that species seemed 
altogether out of the field ; nevertheless it is quite apparent when 
pointed out. I may add that Mr. A. G. More, the recognised 
head of Irish botanists, has seen a specimen, and concurs in the 
determination. C. aquatilis grows near Drumshambo, in a swampy 
thicket on that part of the shore of Lough Allen which lies in the 
County Eoscommon. I saw three or four tufts, each bearing several 
flowering stems, two or three feet high. Some stems were too far 
advanced, but the majority were in excellent condition for diagnosis. 
The district, as regards rare plants, proved unusually poor, but the 
flora of Ben Bulben, some 25 miles north, presents the greatest 
assemblage of alpine and sub-alpine plants in Ireland. The 
discovery of this sedge is associated in my memory with mournful 
recollections. It was found on the 9th August, 1883, the same day 
and about the same hour when two young and ardent naturalists were 
being drowned, while botanising on Lough Gill, in the adjoining 
county of Sligo. The furious gusts of wind and rain which drove 
me to seek the most sheltered spots, and thus compelled me to 
meet with this plant, were at the same time doing to death my 
young friend Corry, with his bright promise of future distinction, 
and his equally enthusiastic companion, Dickson. — S. A. Stewart. 

Heterostyled Plants. — The fact that, among the English 
members of the genus Primula, the long- styled plants are, on 
an average, decidedly more numerous than the short-styled plants

SHORT NOTES. 



{vide Trans. Essex Field Club, vol. iii., p. 157), naturally suggests 
the question. Does this fecundity extend to other dimorphic and 
trimorphic heterostyled species ? Not being aware of any observa- 
tions bearing upon the subject, I have lately seized such oppor- 
tunities as have presented themselves for examining heterostyled 
species, in order to endeavour to throw some light upon the matter. 
Most of the observations given in the following table were made 
whilst travelling in the United States of Canada, twice when 
engines had broken down, and once whilst waiting for a train. 
Observation No. 1 was made by Mr. John Gibbs, of Chelmsford 
(Proc. Essex Field Club, vol. ii., p. 6) ; the observations combined 
to form No. 9 were made by my friend, Mr. Ernest E. T. Seton, of 
Toronto. Tlie only conclusion that can be safely drawn from an 
examination of the tabular statement is that, so far as the details 
contained in it are concerned, no general statement can be made 
as to the preponderance of either one form or the other in the 
species already examined.

Carex ligerica Gay in West Norfolk. — Subsequent to finding 
this plant at Castle Kising, in West Norfolk, as recorded in the 
' Journal of Botany' for July last, I also found it growing sparingly 
in the adjoining parishes of North Wooten and Sandringham. 
The former is about a mile west, and the latter three miles north, 
of the Castle Rising locahty, where it was growing somewhat 
plentifully. I also searched the coast-line in several places, but 
did not find it. — Alfred Balding.

The periodicals cited in this list are : ' Botanical Magazine,' 
' Gardeners' Chronicle,' ' Icones Plantarum,' ' Journal of Botany,' 
and the ' Journal ' and ' Transactions ' of the Linuean Society of 
London. 

We have added in square brackets the publishers of certain 
names which are cited from the MS. description or notes of those 
who stand as the authority for them — e.g., Cyperus actinostachys was 
so named in MS. by Welwitsch, but the publication of the name 
is due to Mr. Ridley ; we therefore print it Cyperus actinostachys 
Welw. MSS. [Ridley] . Primula dulomitis Hort. Llewelyn stands 
as Primula dolomitis Hort. Llewelyn [Baker] ; in this case we 
imagine all will agree in quoting the plant as P. dolomitis Baker, 
although in the preceding instance there may be a difference of 
opinion. New genera are indicated by a prefixed asterisk.

NOTICES OF BOOKS. 

We have ou our table several volumes which call for notice. 
Two or three of these we had put aside for more detailed exami- 
nation than the exigencies of our space will at present permit ; 
but it seems better to make some brief mention of them than to 
risk further and somewhat indefinite delay. 



58 NOTICES OF BOOKS. 

The Clarendon Press has issued a handsome volume on the 
' Comparative Anatomy of the Vegetative Organs of the Phanero- 
gams and Ferns,' a translation by Messrs. F. 0. Bower and D. H. 
Scott of Prof. De Bary's important work. We hope at a future 
date to notice this at greater length, so will now content ourselves 
with this reference. 

The translation of M. DeCandolle's ' Origin of Cultivated Plants,' 
which has been for some time anxiously looked for, has been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co. Probably no more 
valuable work, whether for reading or for reference, has appeared 
in the ' International Scientific Series,' of which it forms a volume. 
When noticing the original French issue (Journ. Bot. 1883, 50), we 
paid our tribute to the exhaustive nature of the work ; it only 
remains to add that the English version is even more complete, 
being enriched with additions by the author embodying some of the 
information given in the valuable papers published by Drs. Asa 
Gray and Trumball in the 'American Journal of Science ' since the 
issue of M. DeCandolle's volume. 

Mr. Murray issues a ' Dictionary of the English Names of 
Plants,' compiled by Mr. William Miller. The book was originally 
advertised under the title of a ' Dictionary of English Plant-names,' 
but that title had already been employed by Messrs. Britten and 
Holland for their work issued by the English Dialect Society. It 
is perhaps not strange that such should have been the case, as the 
title must have been very familiar to the compiler, who has very 
freely availed himself of the Dialect Society's w^ork, although be 
makes no reference to the source from which many of his names 
are taken. That this is the case can easily be shown : Mr. Miller 
on his first page, for example, under the heading "Adder," gives 
nine names, eight of which are to be found in the ' Dictionary of 
English Plant-names,' all of them cited or entered there on in- 
formation hitherto unpublished, or quoted from out-of-the-way 
sources. On the same page the error by which Messrs. Britten 
and Holland inadvertently cited "Affadil" as an equivalent for 
Nrnxissus Fseudu-narcisHUs is unhesitatingly followed. The book is 
well printed and comprehensive ; we have no reason to doubt the 
prefatory statement that it contains 15,000 names, but on what 
ground these are styled "English" it is not easy to understand. 
Under the heading " Stonecrop," for instance, are no less than 
fifty-three entries ; but we fail to see what advantage such titles as 
"Ditch Stonecrop of N. America," " Ewers's Stonecrop," "Mee- 
han's Stonecrop," "Pale rose-coloured Stonecrop," "Variegated 
Japanese Stonecrop," "Wightmann's Stonecrop," and the like 
have over their Latin equivalents. 

The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge has published 
a handsome volume of figures of all our British ferns, with 
text, under the title of ' The Fern Portfolio.' The author, Mr. 
F. Gr. Heath, has, as is well known, published several volumes on 
this subject, but none have seemed to us so satisfactory as the 
present. We think he a little over-estimates the amount of time 
and labour which the execution of the work has required ; but he

has certainly produced a volume which is likely to be useful, seeing 
how inexhaustible is the demand for works on this popular class 
of plants. 

A handsome and important addition to our books on the folk- 
lore of plants is issued by Messrs. Sampson Low & Co., under the 
title of ' Plant Lore, Legends, and Lyrics,' by Eichard Folkard, jun. 
The work shows very great care and industry ; Mr. Folkard has 
appreciated at their true value the stores of information to be 
found in our old herbals ; and his quotations from them are varied 
and judicious, and somewhat out of the ordinary run. His frontis- 
piece is a good representation of that of Parkinson's ' Paradisi in 
Sole,' and the other illustrations are quaint and appropriate. The 
book is divided into two parts ; the first arranged in chapters 
dealmg with different branches of the subject, as " The World-trees 
of the Ancients," " The Trees of Paradise and the Tree of Adam," 
and so on ; the second being " An Encyclopaedia of Six Hundred 
Plants, English and Foreign, giving their Myths, Legends, 
Traditions, Folklore, Symbolism, and History." In this latter 
half much use, duly acknowledged, has been made of De Gubernatis' 
' La Mythologie des Plantes.' 

We have referred to the serial issue of ' The Illustrated Dictionary 
of Gardening' (L. Upcott Gill), the first volume (A — E) of which 
is now before us, bearing Mr. George Nicholson's name on its title- 
page. This would be a guarantee of the satisfactory quality of the 
work, so far as the letterpress is concerned ; the engravings, too, 
are for the most part good, but are clearly collected from very 
various sources. There seems a certain want of proportion not 
only in the size of these, but in regard to their practical utility ; 
for example, pp. 434-438 are mainly occupied by figures of varieties 
of single Dahlia. The references to published figures form a useful 
feature, but we regret that the abbreviations adopted are such as to 
necessitate constant reference to the table of explanations. We 
would venture to say that no one would offhand imagine that 
" W. 0. A." stood for "Warner and Williams' Orchid Album," or 
that "B" represented Maund's ' Botanist.'

burger (Jena, Gustav Fischer, 1884). 

In these two books Prof. Strasburger has suj^plied a very 
urgent want. So many researches have been spoilt through 
ignorance of proper methods in carrying them out, that instruction 
on the subject must be a welcome contribution to literature. In 
the former and larger of these two books, the course of practical 
work is designed for advanced students especially, tbough the 
sections in large type were originally intended to serve as ele- 
mentary lessons, while the details accompanying these in smaller 
type were for the use of those Avho proceed farther. Thougli such 
an arrangement has many advantages, it is obvious that there is 
much to be said against it, and the author has at once answered

such objections by the production of the latter book for the use of 
beginners. This elementary book is an exceedingly lucid and 
serviceable reduction of the larger one, and is certain to prove 
of great benefit. The ' Botanische Practicum ' itself will be of use, 
not only in fitting the advanced student for original research, but 
as a handbook for elementary teachers, who in practical demon- 
strations are sometimes in the dangerous position of knowing very 
little more than what they teach. The book is divided into thirty- 
four lessons, prefaced by an introduction dealing with micro- 
scopes and all necessary apparatus, and containing advice of the 
most excellent kind. The lessons are adapted to the progress 
of the student, beginning with simple subjects and proceeding to 
more complex. Each lesson, it may be said, is sufficient to occupy 
even students of a very advanced type, for considerably longer 
than the term lesson commonly implies. In the present position 
of microscopical research, a book of this kind has become neces- 
sary to the large class of " workers by themselves," to enable 
them to keep pace with the progress of science. It is necessary now 
to bring so much more than mere microscopic vision to the work, 
that instruction in the various methods of preparation of objects 
(such as bacteria, &c.) will give this book an especial value in the 
eyes of those whose isolated position deprives them of the resources 
to which others have access. G. M. 



Vergleichende Morphologie und Biologie der Pilze, Mycetozoen tmd 
Bacterien; von A. de Baky. (Leipzig, Engelmann, 1884). 

Those who take up this book with the expectation af finding 
in it a second edition of the author's ' Morphologie und Physiologie 
der Pilze, Flechten und Myxomyceten ' will be agreeably surprised 
to find that the progress of mycology during the last twenty years 
has been such as to necessitate the production of what is in point 
of fact a new book ; and, moreover, that Prof, de Bary has again 
undertaken the arduous labour of gathering in the materials thus 
furnished, and of providing from these a text-book worthy of the 
progress it chronicles. To give any adequate idea of the contents 
and the manner of treatment of the great range of subjects would 
need wider bounds than those of a short notice. Such a notice, 
however, would be incomplete without mention of the classifica- 
tion of Fungi adopted by Prof, de Bary, which though first 
sketched two years ago in the Beitrage zur Morph. v. Physiol, der 
Pilze, now gains special importance from its employment in what 
will prove no doubt the standard text-book for a number of years 
to come. 

Prof, de Bary thus classifies the Fungi, and no one can read 
the chapter dealing with the principles underlying the classifica- 
tion without feeling the force of the case made out for it : —

After dealing with the Fungi proper, the life-histories of the 
orders, their physiology, &c.. Prof, de Bary proceeds to the 
Mycetozoa and subsequently to the Bacteria, each of these great 
groups being considered in great detail and with striking lucidity. 
One cannot say more of the book than that no serious worker at 
these interesting organisms can either dispense with it or consult 
it without profit. G. M. 

A Monograph of the Ah/cB of the Firth of Forth. Illustrated with 
herbarium specimens of some of the rarer species. By 
G. W. Traill, Joppa, near Edinburgh. 1885. 4to. 

At first sight this work would appear to be merely a list of the 
Algas of the Firth of Forth, illustrated with a few specimens. It 
is, however, the result of the work of a true and enthusiastic 
naturalist, who, in spite of numerous difficulties, has for many years 
carefully observed and recorded the appearance, maturity and dis- 
appearance, year after year, of all the species here recorded. It is 
therefore extremely valuable, as indicating just those points con- 
cerning Marine Algae to which too little attention has been paid by 
many authors. The consequence of this neglect has hitherto been 
that in this country, at least, very few investigations of the 
fructification of this class of plants have been made, and in several 
common British species some forms of fruit are still unknown. 
Mr. Traill, by constant searching during the most inclement 
weather, has discovered the unilocular sporangia of Sphdcelaria 
pliDiuijera, and has thus helped to prove that it belongs to the 
genus Sphacelarin and not to Chatopteris, with which it had pre- 
viously been confounded, the same discovery also showing that 
Chcetopteris should rightly be placed under Clddostrjihm. He has 
also searched for and found several Scandinavian species which had 
been pointed out to him as likely to occur on the east coast of 



62 AKTICLES IN JOURNALS. 

Scotland. He has, moreover, rendered good service in recording 
the host plants upon which other Algfe grow parasitically. The 
number of species enumerated, as found on the shores of the Firth 
of Forth, are 225, of which one-ninth of the whole number are new 
to Britain, having been found since the publication of Harvey's 
' Phycologia Britannica.' The observations which Mr. Traill has 
made and now published must therefore be regarded as a valuable 
contribution to our linowledge of the British Marine Flora, and to 
the life-history of nearly half the British species. There are eight 
illustrations of the rarer species, varying in different copies, but 
Spluicelaria plumiyera, Callithamnion arbuscida, and Dictyosiphon 
Mesugloia occur in most of them, and Callithamnion harhatum in 
some. The work should be in the hands of all lovers of this 
beautiful class of plants, and especially of those interested in the 
fructification of Marine Alga. E. M. H. 

Messrs. W. H. Allen & Co. send us a pretty little volume of 
Transatlantic origin, entitled ' The Wonders of Plant-life under the 
Microscope,' by Sophie Bledsoe Herrick. The chapters are in 
part reprinted from ' Scribner's Monthly,' with several additional 
ones intended to render the series more connected. Insectivorous 
plants come in for a large share of consideration. There are 
numerous illustrations, many of them good and new.

We are glad to learn that the Woolhope Naturalists' Field 
Club has commenced the publication of the flora of the county of 
Hereford, and it is hoped tliat the volume will be in the hands 
of the members by the end of the summer. A summary of the 
plants found in the county was published in the Transactions of 
the Club so far back as 1867, but the completion of the flora, for 
various reasons, was unavoidably postponed. The work will be 
edited by the Rev. Augustin Ley. It will be brought up to the 
present time, and thus some amends be made to botanists by the 
greater completeness attained.

HOMOLOGY OF THE FLORAL ENVELOPES IN 
GRAMINEM AND CYPERACE.E. 

By F. Townsend, M.A., F.L.S. 

It is now more than ten years since I called attention, in the 
pages of this journal,* to " some points relating to the morphology 
of Carex and other Monocotyledons." In my paper on this subject 
I then stated that I hoped, on a future occasion, to shew " that 
there is a great similarity in the construction of grasses and 
sedges, and that the correlative position of their parts leads to the 
conclusion that the two-nerved or keeled inner pale of grasses is a 
single floral bract. I propose now, in a measure, to fulfil that 
promise, in the first place by recording my notes on several 
species belonging to the orders Graminece and Ct/peracea;, and 
secondly, by stating the conclusions which may be drawn from the 
facts brought forward, and my present paper may be considered as 
supplementary to my former one. I say in a measure, because I 
am aware that the subject might be better and more fully handled, 
but as time and opportunity might fail me, it seems better that my 
promise should be even imperfectly rather than not at all fulfilled. 

Notes 011 several species belonf/mr/ to the order Ci/peraced, examined more 
particularly with the view of ascertaining the homology of the parts 
of the inflorescence. 

Cabices : Heterostachya;. 
(In all the following species the ochrea is short.) 

Carex riparia. — The ochrea in this species is short, cloven to 
the base and dark-coloured (Tab. A., fig. 2). The ochrea of the 
upper female spikes is swollen at the sides (Tab. A, figs. 2, and la), 
and approaches nearer to the form of the utriculus, shewing the 
passage of the ochrea into the utriculus. 

At the base of every male spike will be found, universally 
present, a fertile flower with single open glume or utriculus situate 
next the main axis, alternate with and opposite to the primary 
bract from which the male spike springs. 

There is an analogy between the bracts subtending the female 
and barren flowers and the utriculus, both being of the nature of a 
bract. This analogy may be well traced in the bracts of this 
species, see Tab. A, figs. 3, 4, 5, 6. 

I have met with several instances in which the bract subtending 
the utriculus has become bifid and three-nerved, also trifid and 
three-nerved (see Fig. 7, b and c). These bracts had one utriculus 
within their axil. It is easy to conceive this trifid bract as pointing 
to the true nature of the three stamens, viz., a single trifid organ, 
each division bearing one anther. 

It was in the examination of this species that I first discovered 
the true nature of the ochrea and utriculus, and saw that the

somewhat common abnormal growth of C. f/lauca (in which the 
female spikes become componnd) exhibits the normal or universal 
law of the growth of the inflorescence of the whole genus (See

C, pvatcox. — TliG ochrea is here a short, tubuhir, closely- fitting 
sheath, truncate, cloven on the anterior side (Tab. 13, fig. 11). In 
this species I have met with an instance of a fertile spike becoming 
barren at the top, bearing a scale in the axis of which was a nut 
only, in the place of the three stamens, the utriculus being 
altogether suppressed ; the stigmas were perfect and three in 
number. I have observed two similar instances in this species. 
The scales bearing the nut were in both cases situate adjacent to the 
usual barren scales of the male flowers.

of the secondary axis in the lower flowers of the female spike, in

panied by any leaf development. 

Fig. 11. — Ochrese on the peduncles of the female spikes. 

Fig. 12. — This fig. represents the base of the male spike of C. prcecox ; the 
first bract, d, being turned back, shows a utriculus, b, the secondary axis of which 
is developed and bears bracts a. The stigmas, c, protrude from the utriculus. 
If in this specimen the secondary axis had developed more fully it would have 
become an upper spike of female flowers, whereas, in this instance, there wa8 
but one femde spike. 

A second specimen of this species confirmed the above view, as the lowermost 
bract in the position of d, fig. 12, bore a very small spike of feuiale flowers, 
which might have escaped attention without close examination. The ^pike 
issued, as above, from a utriculus, the stigmas of which protruded from its moutli, 
pushed rather on one side by the growth of the secondary branch. 

It may be noted here that the upper bracts of the male spike 
are " surrounding," the last but one surrounding the last and 
terminal bract most completely. The position of the three filaments

of the stamens within the bracts is collateral in all but the terminal 
flower ; in the terminal flower, where the filaments are free from 
lateral pressure, they are placed in a triangular position. 

C. panicca. — The ochrea of the lowest female spike is short, 
2-8tlis in. in length, and many times shorter than the peduncle. It 
is sheathing, with a rounded, oblique, or truncate apex, convex 
in front, flattened on the back, keeled on either side. 

C. 2)endula. — The ochrea here is short, 
3-lGths in. to 2-8ths in. long, sheathing, but 
slit on ojie side nearly to the base, mem- 
branous, nerved, with truncate, erose, fus- 
cous apex, those of the upper peduncles with 
two distinct green nerves on either side. 

C. hiiwrvis.- — Here the ochrea is short (but 
long as compared with that of C. Umujata) 
2-8ths in. in length, tubular, membranous, 
with slightly oblique truncate mouth. 

0. heviijata. — Here the ochrea is remark- 
ably short, sheathing, membranous, truncate, 
and aftbrds a good specific character by which 
this species may be at once distinguished from 
C. hincrvis. The lowest bract of the barren 
spike in this species usually bears four sta- 
mens in its axil, and these are always placed 
collaterally. In two or three instances I have 
found this bract bearing yii^e stamens. 

Fig. 13. — This represents the hase of a male spike 
of C. Icevigata, the lowest bract of which bore iu its 
axil one stamen and two styles with stigmas, the two 
styles being approximate. 

Fig. 14. — This rejiresents an instance (recorded in 
1872, and drawings made at time of observation) in 
which one of the bracts, at the base of a male spike of 
C. Icevigata, bore one central stamen, and two styles, 
one on either side of the single stamen.* There was 
no appearance of any ovary, and the styles ended as 
abruptly below as the filaments of the stamens. 

In this species I have, in one instance, 
found the lowest bract of a male spike, bearing, 
instead of stamens, a female flower with single 
nut and two stigmas and a bract-like, im- 
perfect utriculus, with a lateral position.

C. ricjida. — Here the oclirea is very short and bract-like, dark 
coloured, with oblique mouth. 

Carices : HeterostaclujcR. 

(lu all the followiug species the ochrea is long.) 

Carex liirta. — The ochrea on the peduncles of the lowest female 
spike is nearly half the length of the peduncle ; it is closely fitting, 
tubular, membranous, nerveless, erose-truncate, ciliate at its apex, 
cloven a little way down on its anterior side ; the ochrea of the 
peduncle of the uppermost female spike is as long as or even 
longer than the peduncle, and is more deeply cloven. The 
peduncles of the lateral barren spikes bear an ochrea in the form 
of an open nerved utriculus without any nut. 

C. sylvatica. — The ochrea of the lower female spikes is a long, 
closed and closely-fitting, transparent, membranous sheath, slightly 
divided at the apex ; the ochrea of the upper spikes becomes 
swollen on one or both sides, and assumes more or less the form of 
the utriculus. I have met with several instances, in this species, 
in which the ochrea is situate at some distance above the spring of 
the secondary axis ; in these cases the ochrea takes the form, more 
or less, of the utriculus, being only partially closed, and the nut 
being sometimes present, sometimes absent. 

C. exttensa. — The ochrea, from a long-stalked fertile spike from 
near the base of the stem, is long, tubular, sheathing, open only a 
short way down in front ; it is nerveless, membranous, fuscous. 
At the base of all the fertile sessile spikes it is shorter, faintly 
nerved, and open in front. 

C. flava. — Here the ochrea is long, tubular, and sheathing, and 
similar in all respects to that of C. extensa. 

C. pedata. — Here the ochrea is long (about one-third the whole 
length of the peduncle), rather loosely sheathing, tubular, mem- 
branous, its mouth oblique, its apex triangular, acute. 

C. depmiperata. — Here the ochrea is very long, delicately mem- 
branous, and sheathing. 

C. digitata. — Here the ochrea is long, delicately membranous, 
and sheathing. 

C. (Bdipostyla. — Here the ochrea is long, delicately membranous, 
and sheathmg. 

Carices : HomostachyiE. 

C. remota. — Here the ochrea is ovate-orbicular, membranous, 
concave at the back, and keeled on either side, the keels being 
formed of the strong lateral nerves ; the apex is erose ; the form is 
therefore bract-like, and it encloses or surrounds the base of the 
spikes and lower flowers. 

C. arenaria. — The ochrea) of the lower fertile spikes are reduced 
to fuscous, many-veined bracts, angular at the base and some- 
times bifid at the apex, shewing a tendency to take the form of the 
utriculus. There is no central green nerve, like that of the bracts 
of the fertile flowers. 



70 THE FLORAL ENVELOPES IN GRAMINE^ AND CYPERACE/1':. 

C. ovalis. — The first bract on the secondary axis is placed 
somewhat laterally, and bears stamens, and is similar to the bracts 
of the other barren flowers, with the exception tliat it is more am- 
plexicaul. It seems possible that this bract may represent the 
ochrea. 

C. stellulata. — Here there seems to be an absence of an ochrea, 
or of any bract that can be recognised as taking its place. The 
first and lowest bract on the secondary axis is nsually placed 
laterally and contains stamens. 

Carices : Monostachijcc. 

C. eluwjata. — The ochrea in this species appears to be absent, 
or its place is occupied by the bract of a normal male flower. 

C. pulicaris. — There appears here to be no bract which can 
be recognised as taking the place of the ochrea. There are several 
sheathmg-bracts, Avith minute leafy appendage, on the stem, the 
innermost being alternate with the first bract of the spike. 
Possibly the ochrea is represented by this innermost sheathing 
leaf or bract. 

In tliis species I have met with a barren flower 
bearing two stamens with their filaments united, the 
anthers being free, while the filament of the third 
stamen was altogether free. 

The accompanying fig. shews the seta-like develop- 
ment of the secondary axis within the utriculus.

Scirpus si/Jvaticus. — In this plant every branch of 
the inflorescence is furnished with an ochrea, even up to the last 
simple spike. 

Cladium. 
Cladium MciriscKs. — Here the ochrea is present at the base of 
all the branches of the inflorescence, but concealed by the sheath- 
ing outer bracts. The homology of the barren glumes of grasses 
is here easily traced. Every ultimate simple spike of the inflores- 
cence of this species is furnished with two bracts, similarly placed, 
as are the barren glumes of grasses, the upper bract subtending the 
lower one and alternate with it. 

Cyperus. 
Cyperus lovt/us. — Here the ochrea is present, and the homology 
of the infloresence of the grasses is as beautifully seen as in 
Cladium Mariscns, the lower and upper barren glumes of grasses 
being represented by the two lower glumes of each spike of the 
flowers of Cyperus.

Gramine^. 
I now go ou to record, in the Order 
Gramine(v, a few instances of abnormal de- 




velopment which are relevant to our present \ 
subject, and shall end my paper by giving \ 
the conclusions which I think may fairly be \^ 
drawn from the facts and reasoning brought 
forward. 

Botanists are generally agreed that the 
terms "pale," "fertile glume," "upper and 
lower barren glumes," are more in accord- 
ance with the homology of the spikelet of 
grasses than the terms " inner or upper 
pale," "outer or lower pale," and "upper 
and outer" or "lower and inner glumes"; 1'^ 

and all deviation from the ordinary form or 

arrangement of parts, or, in other words, all instances of abnormal 
development are of special interest if they support these views. 

I have, in my notes, the record of the occurrence, in 1873, in 
Hampshire, of a specimen of Lolium perenne, or common rye-grass, 
in which the upper, outer, single, and usually barren glume of one 
of the spikelets was transformed into a fertile one by the develop- 
ment of a bifid pale (exactly similar to the pale of a normal 
fertile floret) alternate with, i.e. subtending, the glume. The 
ovary was, to all appearance, perfect, but there was only one 
stamen. 

Both Babington and Koch call the suppressed glume in Lolium 
the " upper" glume, while Kunth calls it rightly the "inner" or 
" lower" glume. It is evidently the lower barren glume which is 
wanting, as may be jn-oved by its position in Festuca loUacca, and 
also by the alternation of the florets, as well as by the homology 
of the spikelet. Now this lower glume being the inner one, there 
niust be, normally, a suppressed outer and subtending leaf or 
bract at the base of each spikelet, and the evidence of its normal 
position and suppression may be distinctly seen, by the presence of 
a raised border extending transversely more than half way round 
the axis of the spikelet (it is seen more faintly at the base of the 
upper spikelets), and this bract sometimes becomes developed more 
or less. 

The presence of a membranous border, in a similar position, in 
many grasses, is very evident, especially in Cynusurus ciistatu.s, and 
it occasionally becomes considerably developed, as in Scsleria 
carulea. I have also specimens of Serrafalcus arvensis (fig. 18), and 
S. commutiitus, in which the bract is developed as a leafy setaceous 
appendage. 

I once gathered a specimen of Festuca loliacea in which the 
upper barren glume of one of the upper spikelets was developed 
into a perfect flower, as in the case of Loliuw. In some spikelets 
of F. luliacea the inner or lower barren glume is wanting, or is

reditced to a very minute scale placed laterally ; and I have recorded 
an instance in which this inner glume was replaced hy two 
scales inserted symmetrically side by side, the two taken together

occupying the position of the usual inner glume, thus shewing a 
tendency in the floral envelopes to become divided, which tendency 
may be seen in the axillary bract (ochrea of Duval Jouve) of Carex.

The second bract beneath the uppermost flowers of lAizula cam- 
pestris is usually divided almost to the base. 

In all cases where I have looked into the matter, it seems to me 
evident that the lower and inner barren glumes of the spikelets of 
grasses is next the rachis, i.e., on the inner side of the branch 
(spikelet), and therefore the position of the absent bract is (as has 
been already proved by its actual presence in instances just given) 
alternate with and anterior to the lower and inner barren glume. 

Now the utriculus of Carex is also always next the rachis, and 
its subtended bract is alternate and anterior ; the position of the 
utriculus is therefore exactly that of the inner and lower barren 
glume of grasses, and the position of the subtending bract of the 
female spike of Canw is exactly that of the usually suppressed 
bract at the base of the spikelets of grasses. 

I contend, therefore, that the homologue of the inner and lower 
barren glume of grasses is the ochrea or utriculus of Carex, while 
the homologue of the suppressed bract at the base of the spikelet 
in grasses is the subtending bract of the utriculus of Carex. 

I have said that the tendency of the utriculus or ochrea (the 
ochrea being undoubtedly the homologue of the utriculus) is to 
become divided, and this division has been shewn to occur in the 
lower barren glume of Festuca ; the tendency also occurs in the 
pale of grasses generally, which is the homologue (in the upper and 
fertile florets) of the utriculus of Carex, as the fertile glume of the 
spikelet in grasses is the homologue of the subtending bract of the 
utriculus in Carex.

alternate with the bract (not shown in the drawing) from which the branch a 
springs. The secondary, clasping, two-nerved bract c, having been removed in 
the second drawing, exposes to view the rudiment c1, which occupies tlie same 
place within the axil of c as the rudiment within the utriculus of Carex. This 
rudiment is usually present within the axils of all the secondary bracts of the 
panicle. It is present within the nxil of the bract e.

74 EXAMINATION OF MR. STEPHEN WILSOn's " SCLEROTIA.'* 

The homology is not weakened by the fact that the lower barren 
glume is often situate high on the pedicel between it and the usually 
suppressed subtending bract below, for I have met with numerous 
cases, particularly in Carex si/lratica, in which the axillary bract, or 
ochrea, is situate some distance from the subtending bract, and in 
these cases the ochrea takes the form, more or less, of the 
utriculus, and the ovary is sometimes present, sometimes absent 
(Tab. A, Carex riparia.) 

The annexed figure (Fig. 19) of a branch of Cri/psis aculeata 
remarkably supports the views set forth in this paper, respecting 
the similarity of the construction of the parts of the infloresence 
in grasses and sedges. The pale in this species is one-nerved. 

Lastly, the seta which I have found to be more or less 
developed in so many species of the genus Carex, and which is so 
characteristic of the genus Uncinia, has been shown to be the 
rudimentary development of a secondary axis, while the " acicula " 
of Dumortier is the terminal portion of the rachilla or main axis 
of the spikelet ; the seta and the acicula are therefore analogous 
portions of two different axes. 

I have endeavoured to prove that the pale in the floret of 
grasses is the homologue of the ochrea and utriculus in C((rcx, and 
that the latter is a single floral envelope; therefore, if my reasoning 
be correct, it necessarily follows that the pale is also single. 



FURTHER EXAMINATION OF MR. STEPHEN WILSON'S 

" SCLEROTIA." 

By George Murray, F.L.S. 

When the examination of these bodies by Dr. Flight and the 
present writer was described (Journ. Bot. 1883, p. 370), and it was 
made known that, so far from being resting states of the potato- 
fungus, they were no other than masses of oxalate of lime, it might 
have been expected that the controversy was ended. However, 
Mr. Wilson's theory, unlike the subject of his speculations, has 
exhibited, after a period of rest and incubation, a return to the 
manifestations of life. Mr. Wilson naturally set about testing the 
results arrived at by Dr. Flight and myself, and succeeded in 
finding not only the oxalate of lime, but after its removal, by means 
of nitric acid, another substance which resembled protoplasm. He 
thereupon jumped to the conclusion that there was life in his 
" sclerotiets" and in his theory. His paper describing his experi- 
ments and inferences appeared in the ' Gardeners' Chronicle' 
(Dec. 13th, 1884), and with it a statement that M-r. Worthington 
Smith, working independently, had fully confirmed his observa- 
tions. A sketch by Mr. Worthington Smith illustrates the gradual 
washing away by nitric acid of a coat of calcium oxalate from the 
inner mass, which resisted the action of the acid.* 

* Mr. Sniilli, it will be remembered, originally deteriiiiued tlie bodies in 
qiiestiou to be Frototnyccs ! 



EXAMINATION OF ME. STEPHEN WILSOn's " SCLKROTIA." 75 

Mr. Greenwood Pirn (Gard. Cliron,, Jan. 17th, 1885) also 
corroborated Mr. Stephen Wilson's results. Lastly, Prof. Trail, 
in two Eeports to the {Scientific Committee of the Koyal Horti- 
cultural Society (Gard. Chron., Jan. 17th and Feb. lith, 1885), de- 
scribes a series of experhnents directly confirming Mr. Wilson's. 
Prof. Trail succeeded in staining the residuum with magenta, 
iodine, and other colouring matters, and stated that he had "no 
doubt that the sclerotioids are masses of protoplasm coated with 
calcium oxalate, probably in the form of minute raphides." He 
failed to discover any signs of a cell-wall, but supposes that " the 
outer surface" (of the residuum), "like a primordial utricle, must 
serve as a wall." 

The oxalate of lime, so far accepted, was thus used to render 
even more astonishing and unique what was sutticiently remarkable 
before. The organism thus constructed by Prof. Trail would take 
the place of Mr. Wilson's former mass of " hornified plasm," and, 
at least in the opinion of the latter, be destined to " plasmodiate," 
"myceliate," and eventually produce the potato disease. 

In repeating these experiments of Messrs. Wilson, Smith, Pirn, 
and Trail with isolated " sclerotiets," there is no difHculty whatever 
(beyond the ordinary one of manipulation) in discovering the sub- 
stance left after treatment with nitric acid, and none whatever in 
obtaining the same results from the various staining processes. 
The difficulty lies in discovering any evidence of the truth of the 
statement that the protoplasm is contained witJiin a coat of calcium 
oxalate. The above observers took no pains to prove it to be so, 
and trusted their case to the baldest assertion. Obviously it suited 
Mr. Wilson's theory. The possibility of the protoplasm being 
outside the oxalate of lime does not appear to have occurred to 
them — obviously that would suit my interpretation of the matter, 
and the theory would fall to the ground again. It is extremely 
easy to prove that the "residuum" is outside. If, instead of 
dissolving the calcium oxalate, the colouring matter (iodine 
solution, for example) be at once applied to an isolated " sclerotiet," 
the desired stain will be readily obtained. This will appear as a 
delicate colouring, and not with the intensity that would result 
were the whole mass to take up the stain. It is therefore apparent 
that the stained substance is outside the oxalate of lime, and the 
natural interpretation is that it is but the remains of the original 
cell- contents of the potato leaf-cell in which the oxalate of lime 
body was formed, adhering to the latter over the surface. 

Mr. Carruthers recently placed in my hands a letter from Dean 
Buckland to Piobert Brown, enclosing leaves, &c., of a potato plant, 
and asking, " Is the enclosed the same affection of the potato 
leaves as that of the last two years?" The letter is dated July 
19th, 1847, and the Dean, no doubt, referred to the potato disease. 
There is no sign of disease on the leaves, which, however, contain 
very abundantly Mr. Wilson's " sclerotiets." Mr. Wilson was thus 
anticipated in his idea that these bodies are connected with the 
potato disease. Mr. Carruthers then suggested to me that the 
potato plants preserved in Sir Hans Sloane's Herbarmm should be

examined, and four plants were found which had evidently been 
healthy and vigorous when collected. From each a very minute 
fragment was taken at random, — all four pieces could easily be 
placed under an ordinary cover-glass, — and in all cases the so-called 
" sclerotiets " were discovered. The plants were (1) from the 
King's Garden, Montpellier, collected by Dr. Charleton (born 1619, 
died 1707) ; (2) a plant collected by Boerhaave (born 1668, died 
1738) ; (3) one of Plukenet's plants — Plukenet was born in 1642 
and died in 1706 ; and (4) a plant " collected about 1660," as 
labelled in Sir Hans Sloane's own handwriting. The two first 
mentioned contain the bodies in question abundantly, and the 
remaining two not so plentifully. These experiments and obser- 
vations appear to me sufficient to prove (1) that the organism 
constructed by Prof. Trail is a wholly imaginary one ; and (2) that 
the bodies in question have no relation to the potato disease. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF BUXTON. 
By Rev. W. Moyle Rogers, F.L.S. 

The following notes are, I believe, strictly supplementary to 
those which have recently appeared in this Journal on the same 
siibject by the Rev. W. H. Painter (1881) and Mr. J. G. Baker 
(Jan. 1884). If they contain, as I hope they will be found to do, 
additional records of some interest, this is due to the fact that my 
stay at Buxton extended fi'om August 8th to September 8th (1884), 
and that circumstances compelled me to confine my botanical 
rambles all that time to the immediate neighbourhood of Buxton, 
so enabling me to explore a very circumscribed district pretty 
thoroughly at the best season. Such heights above sea-level as I 
am able to give I owe to the information on that point supplied in 
Mr. Baker's paper. The few stations which will be found here, 
but not in either of the preceding papers, — viz., Chapel-en-le-Frith, 
Whaley Bridge, and Bugsworth, — lie to the north of Buxton, and 
are all, I believe, on millstone grit.

Fiubus a/finis W. & N. I give this name, on Mr. Baker's 
authority, to a luxuriant and very handsome bramble which I 
found in great quantity about "New Mills," on the Derbyshire 
side of River Goyt, near Whaley Bridge Railway-station. He 
considers it the usual northern form of this species. I had thought 
it nearer Fi. calvatus Blox., but I have seen nothing quite like it in 
S. England. — F. leucustaclujs Sm. In one place only, near the 
top of the hill above Monsal Dale, by the Cressbrook School 
Church, about 250 yds. ; very fine and characteristic. — F. discolor 
W. &N. I searched for in vain. Close to Buxton, the only bramble 
(except hlciius) that occurs in any quantity is F. pallidus Weihe, and 
that nowhere iu the open ; but in one spot in Corbar Wood I found 
a small patch of another species growing in such deep shade as to

have lost all good distinctive characters ; and in Ashwood Dale, up 
to 300 yds., as in the Wye Valley generally, and at Chapel-en-le- 
Frith, &c., to the north of Buxton, the prevalence of li. pallidm is 
rivalled hy that of the Pi. diunetonun vav. concinnm mentioned in the 
'Notes on the Flora of Matlock' (Journ. Bot. Nov. 1884), which, 
I believe, is not distinguishable from the R. conjlifolius, y. purpureus 
of Bab. Man. and Lond. Cat. The only other brambles that I saw 
in the district were R. conjlifolius Sm. (chiefly good R. suhlitstris 
Lees), R. ca;sias L. (scarce), R. ChcwKBinonis L. (Axe Edge only), 
and a handsome nearly prostrate one on the hill above Miller's 
Dale Railway-station (350 yds.), which (especially in the foliage) 
reminded me of R. [jindUianm Lees, though clearly distinct from 
it ; this Mr. Bagnall is inclined to name 7i. Saltcrl, putting it with 
a similar plant which he finds in three of the Warwickshire woods, 
and which has been accepted by Prof. Babington as the "i^. Salteri 
of Bloxam " ; and also with another from Plympton St. Mary, 
Devon, which Mr. Bloxam named R. Salteri for Mr. Briggs many 
years ago.

to that given by Gahnia trifitis Nees, and Lepidosperma Chinense 
Nees, of the affinity of the South Chinese Cyperaceous flora with 
that of the Australian continent. Its nearest allies are, I believe, 
0. Preisui F. Muell. and C. laxum Benth., both from Western 
Australia, of neither of which do I possess specimens. The 
creeping rhizome, flat, non-spongiose leaves, and narrow panicle 
readily distinguish it from the Singalese Baumea crassa Thw. ! 



NOTES ON THE BRITISH CHARACKyE FOE 1884. 
By Henry & James Groves. 

Since the publication of the last instalment of our ' Notes ' we 
have had but little to record beyond additions to the account of the 
comital distribution of the species and varieties. Lychnothamnus 
steLliger, from South Devon, Chara contraria var. hispidula, from 
Cheshire, Tohjpella prolifera, from Cambs. and Hunts, and T. 
glomerata, from Sligo and Leitrim, are the most important records. 
We have to thank our correspondents for the many specimens, 
both fresh and dried, which they have forwarded.

T. prolifera, Leonh. — Cambs. and Hunts, near Benwick, 1884, 
A. Fryer. 

In ' English Botany,' ed. 3, vol. xh., p. 189, Mr. N. E. Brown 
Avrites : — " The plant collected by Mr. D. Moore in the grand 
canal, Glasnevin, Dublin, has been wrongly referred by Messrs. 



A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS A FLORA OF BRECONSHIRE, 83 

Groves to N. prolifera ; it belongs to .V. intricata, as the sterile 
branclilets are branched, and not simple as in the var. jn-oli/'era, 
which has not yet been found in Ireland." If Mr. Brown had taken 
the trouble to read further on the same page of our ' Review,' he 
would have found that both species occurred at Dublin, and 
would not have blundered into such a self-confident misstatement.

D. Turner (in Linn. Soc. Herb.) ; Suffolk W., 1883, G. C. Druce; 
Westmoreland (Lake Lanes.), 1884, T. Hebden ; Berwick, 1881, 
Renton (Hb. Bennett); Stirling, 1884, R. Kidston; Ebudes N., 
1884, E. F. Linton ; Eoss W. and EossE. (Cromarty), 1881, G. C. 
Druce ; "Waterford, 1882, G. Nicholson {Hb. Bennett) ; Armagh, 
1874, S. A. Stewart (in Hb. More) ; Londonderry, 1839, W. 
Thompson (in Hb. More). We have received from Mr. Fryer 
specimens of a Nitella from Cambridgeshire, which is apparently a 
monoecious form of this species. Mr. Fryer informs us that in early 
spring the plant only produced globules, later on both globules and 
nucules, and in the summer principally nucules. We should be glad 
if our correspondents will examine any forms of N. opaca that they 
may find, to see if this is an isolated case. 

Correction. — In our Eeview the bulbils of Chara fragilis and 
C. aspera are erroneously described as calcareous ; their principal 
contents are starch granules.

SHORT NOTES. 

Hemerocallis flava naturalised in Wales. — In one of the sea- 
coast woods at Penrliyn Castle this plant has now become quite 
naturalised, large patches of from 600 to over 1000 plants in each 
occurring in several parts of the wood and at considerable distances 
apart. The wood in which they are found runs nearly at right 
angles to the Menai Strait, the first patch of the Hemerocallis being 
within 20 yards of the sea, the second 370 yards farther along, and 
the third, which contains the greatest number of plants, 200 yards 
from the second. I am rather puzzled to account for the appear- 
ance and distribution of the plant, more particularly the latter, as, 
strange to say, although I have watched it carefully for the past 
seven years, no flowers have been produced, although the plants 
are remarkably strong and vigorous, so that its dissemination by 
seed is out of the question. Previous to the formation of that part 
of the park in which the plant abounds (about 100 years ago), 
I see from an old map or plan that three farm-houses stood at or 
near where the clumps occur ; so that it is but reasonable to 
suppose that the plant was introduced to one of the gardens 
attached to the farm-houses, and from which roots would no doubt, 
as is very commonly the case even now, be distributed amongst 
the others. This explanation is not at all improbable, as the plant 
was introduced from Siberia as early as 1596. I am not aware 
that elsewhere in Britain has the Hemerocallis become established 
in such quantity ; indeed, in a letter from Sir Joseph Hooker he 
considers the case as very remarkable and well worth recording, 
although, as he says, considering what a vigorous rooter the plant 
is, it is a wonder it has not established itself elsewhere. — A. D. 
Webster. 

Erica Tetralix in the Faroe Islands. — Mr. J. Backhouse, Jun., 
of York, during a short visit to the Faroes last September, gathered 
this heath at Trangisvaag, in Suderoe. It is an addition to Rostrup's 
' Flora of the Islands,' and interesting, as all our three common 
heaths are now on record for these isles ; while E. cinerea, although 
recorded for Iceland by Solander and Morck, is not admitted by 
Babiugtoii (Rev. Fl. Iceland) or Grouluud (Fl. of Iceland). Suderoe 
is the southernmost isle of the group, and Trangisvaag is at the 
head of a deep " fiord" of the sea. — Arthur Bennett.

After having lain for about ten years in the herbarium of the 
Paris Museum, the Chinese botanical collections of the Abbe 
Armand David have been at last taken in hand by M. Franchet, 
and the name of the author of the ' Enumeratio plantarum in 
Japonia ' is a sufficient guarantee for excellent work in the pub- 
lication before us. 

The Abbe David was for a long time attached to the Lazarist 
Mission in Peking, where he had an opportu.nity of collecting most 
of the species of North China and of adjacent Mongolia. After- 
wards, under a commission from the French Minister of Public 
Instruction, he travelled widely through Central and Western 
China, and spent some nine months in Eastern Thibet. During 
these explorations his attention was chiefly given to Zoology, but 
he botanized as well, although he says that his collections must 
be regarded only as samples of the rich flora of these regions. 

The total collections, according to M. Franchet, represent over 
1500 species. The importance of the present volume, which deals 
exclusively with plants from Mongolia and Northern and Central 
China, is shown by its enumeration of 1143 species, of which 
about 950 are recorded from China proper, while 64 are new to 
science. 

The enumeration is prefaced by a most interesting letter from 
the Abbe David, giving a rapid sketch of his travels from a 
botanical point of view, with some account of the relation of the 
flora to the geological structure of the country traversed. 

For the purposes of natural history Abbe David divides the 
Chinese Empire into three great regions : — I. North China, 
extending from the Yellow Eiver to the borders of Manchuria. 
II. Eastern Mongolia, adjoining the Great Wall. III. The whole 
of the generally mountainous country which forms South China, 
including the enormous basin of the Yangtsze Eiver. 

The first and second regions are very similar in their fauna 
and flora, as well as in their climate, the characteristics of which 
are : — 1st, Great dryness, with some storms in summer, but with 
little rain or snow during the rest of the year, and without heavy 
dews until early July after the first showers. 2nd, A sky usually 
clear, with frequent and disagreeable northerly winds. 3rd, Kegu- 
larity of the seasons, the summer heat and winter cold being rarely 
disturbed by sudden changes of temperature. 4th, A long, very 
hot summer, and a rigorous winter. At Peking the great cold sets 
in, almost without a transition, in November, and the river and sea- 
coast are closed by ice from early December to March. In summer 
the thermometer often rises above 105^ Fahr. in the shade, while

the minimum winter temperature oscillates between 20° and 10° 
Fahr. It is, however, sometimes 15° lower, and in Mongolia cold 
of 25° below zero is not uncommon. 

"While therefore no plants from warm countries can survive the 
Peking winter, many tropical annual species can be cultivated far 
to the north. Bamboos, for instance, which thrive on all the 
mountains of South China, are not found in a wild state north of 
the Yellow Eiver ; and, on the otber hand, rice, sesame, cotton, 
sweet potatoes, &c., are successfully grown up to the borders 
of Manchuria. Again, the two or three (doubtless introduced) 
varieties of the grape-vine, which are cultivated near Peking, have 
to be completely covered with earth every winter. 

The climate of the provinces south of the Yangtsze Eiver is 
subtropical, with frequent rains throughout the year, less however, 
in winter than in summer. Vegetation therefore is much more 
luxuriant than in the north, but without being varied. Abbe 
David alludes to the close connection between the flora of Kiangsi, 
Kiangnan and Chekiang and that of Japan, a fact which has been 
already established, while the relations of the Southern provinces 
to Cochin China and India have yet to be worked out. 

One of the greatest evils with which China has now to contend 
is the result of the forest devastation which has gone on for 
centuries, either for the purpose of clearing ground for agriculture 
or for the sake of the timber. Abbe David further suggests 
that, as the tiger and the leopard once roamed through the 
forests, human life could not have been safe in their neigh- 
bourhood, especially for people who kept but few cattle ; and 
that the destruction of the haunts of these wild beasts may 
have been resorted to as a means of exterminating the pests. 
At all events the timber has practically disappeared from the 
mountains and hills of China, and Abbe David says that it is only 
on almost inaccessible slopes that remains of old forests are to be 
found. It must have been only from inadvertence that he has 
omitted to mention the neighbourhood of Buddhist monasteries 
and temples as among the few places where the native tree vegeta- 
tion of China is still preserved. This fact has been j)ointed out by 
Dr. Hance in more than one place in this Journal,* and although 
more especially referring to the Southern provinces, his obser- 
vations are none the less true regarding other parts of China 
further north, as the writer of this notice is able to testify. 

The Abbe David's preface contains a long and highly in- 
teresting account of Moupine, a small quasi-independent state 
of Eastern Thibet, where this zealous naturalist spent nine 
months and whence came his most remarkable zoological novelties. 
The word "Moupine," according to Abbe David, signifies "wooded 
plain," a name which, he adds, must have been given ironically, as 
the whole district so bristles with mountain peaks that it must 
require an effort of imagination for the inhabitants to realize what 
a iDlain means. In this range there are several snow-capped

mountains, loftier even than the one which he himself ascended, 
and which he fomid to be 16,500 feet in height. The slopes here 
are still thickly wooded up to 11,500 feet. The climate is hard 
and disagreeable, damp and very foggy. The winters are cold, 
with much snow, which remains in sheltered valleys till May or 
June. During the rest of the year it rains almost every day, and 
the atmosphere is so charged with moisture that, according to the 
inhabitants, a gun shot will bring on a shower in calm weather! 

Such a climate is naturally favourable to the growth of plants 
like ferns, conifers, and rhododendrons. The latter are the woody 
plants found at the greatest altitude, and fifteen to twenty species 
were observed, which with their magnificent flowers gave a charming 
aspect to the landscape from April to July. At Moupine Abbe 
David saw a number of trees, unknown to him and probably new 
species, which with rhododendrons, box, aralias, and bamboos, 
form impenetrable thickets, the home of the Amherst Pheasant. 
Here, at an altitude of 6500 feet, was found the curious tree 
named Davidia by Baillon,- growing with a fine species of cherry, 
a gigantic hazel, an oak with cork bark, and various LaurinecB. 
Many species of Ficus were met with, some of them large trees, 
others tall climbers, and one a creeper, with good-sized, very sweet 
fruits, which are only produced on those parts of the plant that 
are hidden under the sand or stones. It was here also that Abbe 
David found the pyramidal poplar, unknown in the rest of China, 
and the weeping willows are spoken of as the finest he had ever 
seen. Besides the ordinary tea-plant, another species called 
" White Tea " is also cultivated at Moupine and in Szechuen. It 
is a taller shrub than the common kind, with elongated and some- 
what downy leaves. 

As to the herbaceous flora of Moupine, although proportionately 
less rich than the arborescent, it is far more interesting than in 
North China, where monotony is the prevailing characteristic. It 
is also to be noted that the few European genera and species repre- 
sented in the northern flora no longer appear in Thibet, except as 
introduced plants. To conclude this notice of Moupine, a curious 
circumstance mentioned by Abbe David may be quoted in his own 
words: — "When the virgin forests are burned to make agricultural 
clearances, the denuded land produces spontaneously, among other 
plants, a great quantity of Sinajds with oleaginous seeds, of which 
the natives gather two or three good crops without any trouble. As 
this species of Sinajjis (which is largely cultivated throughout 
China) is never found in the woods, it may well be asked whence 
and when came these seeds which have retained their germinating 
power for an incalculable number of years ? " 

Turning to the systematic part of the book, we have space only 
for a few notes that have suggested themselves during a cursory 
examination of its pages. 

We observe with interest that Clematis Davidiana Dene, is con- 
sidered only a variety of 0. tubulosa Turcz., which the present

writer has shown to be reducible to C. heradeifoUa DC* 
M. Franchet has followed M. Maximowicz iu this decision, which 
he bases not only on the wild specimens brought home by Abbe 
David, but upon his own study of the plants under cultivation in 
Paris. 

Ranunculus ternatus Thbg. is a species about which there has 
been some confusion. Thuuberg's original diagnosis (Fl. Jap., 
p. 241) was very meagre, but DeCaudolle, in 1817 (Syst. i. p. 242), 
carefully described the plant, apparently after an authentic 
specimen in Delessert's herbarium. In 1824 Wallstrom (Dissert. 
PL Jap.) figured a plant, presumably from Thunberg's herbarium 
in Upsala, with the name of li. ternatus, but without description. 
The name, as applied by DeCandolle, was adopted by Prof. Asa 
Gray (Bot. of Japan), by Siebold and Zuccarini (Fl. Jap. Fam. 
Nat.), by Miquel, who gave a detailed description (Prol. p. 192), 
and by Franchet and Salvatier (Enum. pi. Jap. i. 7). The latter 
authors further [I. c. ii. 268) suggested that Wallstrom's figure was 
identical with R. Zuccarinii Miq., but M. Maximowicz (Fragmenta, 
p. 3), while confirming this, claimed that the plate must be taken 
to represent the true R. ternatus of Thunberg, and that DeCan- 
doUe's description was referable to R. japonicus Langsdorff (non 
Thbg.). M. Franchet now sums up the discussion in a way that 
appears to me to set it at rest: — " Je ne puis partager I'avis de 
M. Maximowicz : de Candolle a tres suffisamment decrit la plante 
sur un specimen authentique, et il la compare au R. aconitifolius, dont 
le jR. Zuccarinii est tres different : il n'est pas admissible de faire 
prevaloir la figure de Wallstrom, assez mauvaise du reste et 
donnee sans description, contre le texte precis de I'auteur du 
' Sy sterna.' " 

Mijosoton aquaticum Moench, is the name under which M. 
Franchet presents to us our old friend Malachium. The genus 
here taken up is noticed neither in the ' Prodromus ' nor in the 
' Genera Plantarum,' although quoted as a synonym by both 
Endlicher and Steudel. As Moench's name (Methodus, p. 225) 
dates from 1794, while Fries's Malachium was not established till 
1817, it would seem that M. Franchet must be followed by those 
who are not satisfied with the Steltaria aquatica sanctioned by 
Bentham and Hooker. 

In adopting (,'tnncUia theifera Griff, as the name for Thea sinensis 
Linn., 1 presume M. Franchet has followed the authors of the 
' Flora Indica ' (vol. i. p. 292), but I am at some loss to understand 
why, in both works, Link's earlier and better name of Camellia 
Thea should have been unnoticed and superseded.! 

The beautiful Xanthoceras sorhifulia Bge., which is commonly 
cultivated about Peking, appears to have been found growing wild 
only on the rocky ranges of Ourato, in Mongolia, not far from the 
great northern bend of the Yellow Piiver. Although it was 
reported to be wild near Jehol, Abbe David had only seen the tree

in cultivation there. From Southern Shensi a new variety of So- 
j)hora Moorcroftiana Beuth. is described. The typical form belongs 
to Northern India, and the species is remarkable in the genus for 
its habit, which approaches that of Carat/cma and Halimodendron. 
Very few Kubi or roses appear to have been collected. Among the 
latter are Rosa BanksicB K. Br. from Southern Shensi, a plant with 
single flowers, but whose spontaneity appears doubtful, and 
B. xanthina Lindl. from Mongoha. Abbe David says : — " Ce joli 
rosier aux mille fleurs est excessivement abondant dans toute cette 
chaine de montagnes : j'en ai trouve une variete curieuse, ou 
toutes les antheres etaient reunies commo dans les Malvacees." 
There is a new Crassula from Jehol, this being, as far as we are 
aware, the first record of this genus from China ; and a sterile 
specimen of Ilamamelis from Kiukiang so resembles the Japanese 
plant that M. Franchet refers it also to H. virginiana L. Of Com- 
positcB 115 species are enumerated, and among the seven new ones 
is a Petasites from Shensi, the first Chinese record of this genua. 
The Indian Buddleia ixiniculata Wall, is reported as abundant in 
Shensi, where Thyrocarpus glochidiatus Maxim., known previously 
from Kansu, was also found. 

Quercus mongolica Fisch. is reduced to a variety of Q, sessiliflora 
Salisb., the numerous specimens collected by Abbe David having 
established this fact beyond doubt to M. Franchet. A new oak 
from Shensi is described by Abbe David as Q. spinosa, and another 
specimen from the same country is doubtfully referred to Q. phylli- 
roioides A. Gray, which was known only from Japan and the 
Liuchu Islands. Both specimens were sterile, and we should not 
be surprised to learn that, with further material in hand, both 
might be found referable to Q. Ilex. From Shensi there are 
specimens (unfortunately also sterile) referred to the long over- 
looked Q. chinensis AbeP'' (not Kob. Brown, as the author's name 
has inadvertently been given). A new Castanopsis is recorded from 
Kiangsi, making the eighth species peculiar to China. About a 
dozen Coniferoi are enumerated from Western China, several of 
which are described as new, while the material for others hardly 
appears to have been sufficient for specific determination. 

Among the Monocotyledons there is not much that is new, but, 
as they amount to only seventeen per cent, of the phanerogams, 
they must be considered as rather poorly represented in the 
collections. 

The volume itself is published with all the luxury of paper, 
type and plates to which we have been accustomed in the 
' Nouvelles Archives du Museum.' Still, at the risk of seeming 
ungracious where so much is of the best, we may venture to regret 
that there is nothing in the way of ordinal or generic names at the 
tops of the pages, to guide the eye in a rapid search through the 



* One of these specimens, kindly communicated by M. Franchet, agrees as 
far as it goes with Abel's description and figure. It appears very distinct from 
Q. sclerophylla Lindl., which I had thought might be identical with Abel's 
species, by the form and peculiar glaucous under surface of the leaves, as well 
as by the much larger greyish silky buds. Vide Journ. Bot. 1884, p. 82.

volume. We may also remark that the types chosen to indicate 
specific names and varieties hardly appear distinct enougli along- 
side the beautiful large print used for the localities and critical 
notes. One must also regret the absence of analytical keys to the 
larger genera, like the admirable ones which M. Franchet compiled 
for his ' Japanese Flora.' But, after all, these are minor details, 
and for the rest the distinguished author may well be congratulated 
on having produced a book which is the most important contribution 
to Chinese botany since the appearance of Bentham's ' Flora 
Hougkongensis.' Francis Blackwell Forbes. 



The Fourth Annual Keport of the Hampstead Naturalists' Club 
contains "a list of botanical species observed in the district," by 
Mr. Eoland Ellis, the times of flowering being given. The list, 
however, is manifestly very incomplete. 

The first number of a new botanical sei'ial, ' The Journal of 
Mycology,' edited by Messrs. Kellerman, Ellis, and Everhart, to 
be published monthly at the low cost of one dollar per annum, 
comes to us from Manhattan, Kansas. It contains papers on 
' New Kansas Fungi,' by Messrs. J. B. Ellis and W. A. Kellerman; 
' New Fungi from Iowa,' by Messrs. J. B. Ellis and E. W. Holwixy ; 
and ' North American Geasters,' by A. P. Morgan ; besides notices 
of other kindred publications. 

Mr. a. E. Gibbs publishes a useful list of Hertfordshire Mosses 
in the Transactions of the Herts Nat. Hist. Society (vol. iii. pt. 2), 
in which Mr. E. A. Pryor's division of the county into river- 
districts has been followed. We regret to learn that there seems 
little prospect of the publication of the new Flora of Hertfordshire, 
on which Mr. Pryor spent so much time and labour, and it seems 
right to state that the Editor of this Journal, to whom the work 
was originally entrusted, has for some time since been relieved of 
any responsibility for its production.

tinuity obtains very widely in the Floridece, the question very naturally 
suggested itself whether similar phenomena were to be met with in 
other groups of Marine Algfe, and especially in the Fucaceic. To 
supply an answer to this question, a very careful investigation of 
the histology of the commoner Fucoids was iinder taken, and the 
results of this form the basis of the present communication. 
I venture to think they conclusively establish the position that 
here too a continuity of protoplasm through the cell walls is in ex- 
istence, which, though of a different type from that described i]^ 
many of the Floridea, is not less certain and definite. 

As in the case of the Floridem, the materials employed have 
been partly sun-dried and partly fresh, the former having been 
found in the majority of cases quite as demonstrative as the latter. 

The methods of treatment adopted to render the arangements 
for continuity perceptible have varied somewhat, owing to the fact 
that the same treatment was not always equally successful with 
different plants. In general terms, the trdtttment was such as would 
either dissolve out the protoplasm from the tissues, or else swell 
up, gelatise, or dissolve the cellulose framework. Pigments of 
various kinds were also made use of for the usual purpose of 
differentiating and demonstrating different structures. The dissolu- 
tion of the protoplasm was usually effected, without any difficulty, 
by dilute solution of common bleaching-poAvder. Greater difficulty 
was at first experienced in swelling the sections sufficiently to 
make clear the relation between the protoplasts and their en- 
velopes. Schultze's solution and sulphuric acid, of themselves, 
were found to be of little use for this purpose, though so valuable 
in the manipulation of tissues from other plants. After a number 
of reagents had been experimented with, alkalies were found to be 
the most effective swelling reagents, and of these ammonia and 
carbonate of ammonia of various strengths were decidedly the most 
serviceable. When a greater or less amount of disintegration of 
the tissues was desired, the sections were treated successively with 
moderately strong sulphuric acid and strong ammonia. The 
various ways in which the reagents were employed need not be 
described in detail, but the following methods were so generally 
followed, and, as a rule, furnished such favourable results, that, for 
the guidance of those who may wish to verify the statements here 
set forth, they may be given in full. 

A. To obtain a general view of the structure of the thallus of 
the plant under investigation, thin sections were placed in fresh

"water for a few minutes and then stained with methyl green, 
acidulated with acetic acid. After well washing with water or 
acetic acid, the sections were put for a short time — varying in 
different cases — into alum-carmine. They were again well washed 
with water, swollen with strong ammonia and mounted in 
glycerine. Sections prepared in this way turn out in a very 
pretty condition, the protoplasmic structures being coloured green, 
and the framework a pale pink or violet. Before swelling with 
ammonia the sections must be thoroughly washed, to remove all 
traces of alum, as otherwise the ammonia will cause a precipitate 
of alumiuic hydrate to be thrown down. 

B, For the determination of more refined details, the sections 
were treated as follows: — Having been washed with fresh water, 
they were stained with an aqueous solution of safl'ranine ; again 
washed with water and swollen with strong ammonia ; and finally 
mounted in glycerine. Thus prepared, the sections showed the 
protoplasts of a pink colour and their envelopes yellow, deepening 
here and there to brown. 

C. Still more satisfactory results were, however, obtained 
thus : — Sections were soaked for from 3 to 12 or 20 hours in a 
mixture of strong sulphuric acid, 1 part, and water, 3 parts. 
They were then washed, stained with saffranine as in the preceding 
process, and mounted in a mixture of glycerine and ammonia. If 
the ammonia is employed to swell the sections before mounting, 
they become so much disintegrated that it is then impossible 
to transfer them to a slide. 

ASCOPHYLLUM NODOSUM Le Jolis. FuCUS NODOSUS L. 

The frond of this Fucoid is so common and abundant on British 
coasts, and its appearance is so well known, that there is no need 
to give any description of its general morphology. It is only neces- 
sary to refer to the leading features of its histological structure. 

In longitudinal sections of any part of the thallus, made 
perpendicular to the flattened surfaces and examined under the 
microscope, we may distinguish, with more or less clearness, an 
epidermis, a cortex, and a central or medullary tissue. PI. 255, 

The epidermis is composed of a single layer of small cylindrical 
cells, averaging 0*0005 inch in breadth, and from 1^ times to twice 
this in length. They are placed with the long diameter per- 
pendicular to the thallus, and are somewhat strongly cuticularised on 
the free surface. In the fresh state the lumen of the cells is filled 
with a dense, granular, brown-coloured protoplasm, and the walls 
appear of no great thickness. In the dried condition, the proto- 
plasm is contracted, and the true thickness of the walls is obvious. 

The cortex consists of 3, 4, or more layers of cells, of a 
somewhat more irregular shape than those of the epidermis, — the 
cells of each layer forming a longitudinal series. The cells in 
contact with the epidermis hardly measure more than 0"0005 inch 
by 0-0005 inch, but, passing from without inwards, the cells 
become larger and more elongated hi the longitudinal direction, 



PROTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE^E. 99 

until they pass over iuto the filamentous tissue of the the centre. 
The cell walls attain considerable thickness, and the protoplasm is 
granular and of a brown colour. Towards the centre the colour 
becomes less pronounced, and almost or entirely disappears. 

An important feature of the cortex is the presence of numerous 
lateral diverticula, which connect the cells of the successive layers 
transversely, so that the whole tissue forms a cell complex, whose 
elements are closely interconnected. The outermost cortical layer 
is connected in a similar manner with the epidermis. 

The Central Tissue. — Towards the centre of the thallus the 
cortical cells pass over into long filaments with thick walls, which 
make up the major part of the central tissue. There is, however, 
no distinct line of separation between the cortex and this tissue. 
The filaments run for the most part longitudinally, and more or 
less parallel to one another. They arc composed of cells, 0*001 
inch in breadth and 0.003 inch in length, on an average, joined 
end to end, whose outer boundaries are usually lost in a gelatinous 
or cartilaginous matrix. The protoplasmic contents are very 
gaanular, but the brown colour of the outer parts of the thallus is 
nearly or altogether absent. Numerous transverse diverticula 
connect the filaments laterally with one another, and the outermost 
with the cortex, so that the whole has more or less of a reticulated 
appearance. 

Beside the filaments that run longitudinally, the central tissue 
contains other structures of a more fibrous character. These 
arise from the cortical cells, curve inwards towards the centre of the 
thallus, and form a sort of " weft " to the filamentous " warp." 
They resemble the filaments in general appearance, but their walls 
are much thicker and the protoplasmic contents are correspond- 
ingly attenuated. Though very fibrous in aspect, they are made 
up of cellular elements, the transverse petitions being very oblique 
and not perpendicular to the side walls as in the filaments. 
PI. 255, Fig. 1 (a). The walls of the fibres are very beautifully 
laminated, and exhibit a very peculiar annulation which the writer 
has not met with in any other group of plants. As shown in 
Fig. 8, it presents itself as a number of ring-like ridges developed 
on the outer surface of the fibre. It was at first imagined that 
these had some connection with the division of the cells, and the 
formation of the sieve-plates described below. But the rings 
formed round the sieve-plates are formed on the inner surface 
of the wall, the outer surface taking no part in their formation. 
Sometimes there are two, three, or more of these external rings 
pretty close together, but in others they are placed singly, at a 
distance from one another. 

In good sections prepared by either of the methods A or B, or 
indeed by any process which ensures a slight contraction of the 
protoplasm, a suspicion of the existence of continuity will be 
created by the appearance of the cell-contents, both in the cortical 
and the central region. For in typical cases the contraction is for 
the most part lateral and not Ivngitudinal, so that although the 
contents retire a little from the side walls of the cells, they usually 



100 PROTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE^. 

remain uncontracted at the ends. Hence, in the cortical layers 
and in the filaments of the central tissue the protoplasm appears, 
under a half or quarter inch objective, to run uninterruptedly from 
cell to cell in the longitudinal direction. PL 255, Fig. 2. 

Similar phenomena are met with in the lateral diverticula 
which unite the filaments and cortical layers transversely, the 
protoplasm ajypccuiiKi to run across without a break. 

The fibres too, which are interwoven with the central filaments, 
seem to have their contents continuous from one end to the other. 

A mere suspicion of continuity, however, is not sufficient to 
satisfy the demands of scientific logic, and to be convinced that it 
actually exists the state of affairs at the ends of the cells must be 
more closely investigated. For this purpose sections prepared by 
the third method described above must be made use of, and even 
these must be supplemented by others of a still more demon- 
strative character. The latter may be obtained by slightly 
modifying the modes of treatment as follows : — 

1st. Sections that are to be treated by the second method 
should be previously placed for a few moments in a weak solution 
of ordinary bleaching powder. 

2nd. Sections that have been treated by the third method 
should be warmed gently in a mixture of equal parts of glycerine 
and potash solution, before being mounted in glycerine and 
ammonia. 

When thus dealt with, favourable preparations allow the follow- 
ing points to be demonstrated, both in the cortical and the central 
tissue. 

{a) At the ends of the cells, i. c, at the point where two 
adjacent cells are united, there is an annular thickening on the 
internal wall not unlike a strongly developed ring of an annular 
vessel. The material of which the ring is composed differs from 
that of the cell walls in not dissolving or undergoing gelatinisation 
under the influence of reagents. It seems to resist alike the 
action of the strongest acids and the strongest alkalies, as well as 
the disintegrating action of a solution of bleaching powder. 

{b) Within this ring the arrangements are not the same in all 
cases, but for the most part they conform to one of four types. 

(i.) In the first type the ring surrounds a comparatively wide 
and open pore, through which the protoplasm is continuous in a 
single thread. This type is not very common, but isolated 
instances are here and there to be met with. (PI. 255, Figs. 3 
and 4). Grave doubts having been expressed respecting the exis- 
tence in other plants of this type of continuity, special care has 
been taken to prevent error on this point, which is admittedly of 
great importance. The result is, that in the mind of the writer 
there is perfect conviction that the description is in strict accord- 
ance with the actual facts. In one extremely favourable pre- 
paration, the thick ring is presented in section at both ends of a 
cell, and the connecting cord of protoplasm is seen in situ, running 
through the pores thus formed. This is shown in PI. 255, Fig. 4. 

(ii.) In the second type a delicate diaphragm stretches across 



PROTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE.E. 101 

the space encloHed by the ring, and through this the protophism is 
coutiuuous, as through a sieve plate, by a number of dehcate 
threads. This is perhaps the commonest form of continuity, and 
bears tlie closest possible resemblance to that met with in the 
sieve-tubes of higher plants. (PL 255, Fig 5.) 

(in.) The third type agrees with the second, except that 
continuity is effected by a thin and delicate ribbon of protoplasm, 
which passes through a narrow slit in the diaphragm. This form 
is not abundant, and appears to be an intermediate form between 
the preceding and the next to be described. (PI. 255, Fig. 6.) 

(iv.) In the fourth type the diaphragm is complete and 
impervious, save at the centre, where is an extremely minute pore, 
through which a single delicate strand of protoplasm maintains the 
continuity. (PL 255, Fig. 7.) 

Besides the cases in which continuity is more or less evident, 
there are numerous others, in which the protoplasm still comes well 
up to the ends of the cells, and so obscures the nature of the con- 
nection between the contiguous protoplasts. This is worthy of 
note, as it shows the tenacity with which the protoplasm adheres to 
the end-plates, even after the roughest treatment, and though not 
demonstrative of continuity, is quite consistent with it and easily 
explicable by it. 

A few cases, again, are met with, in which the ends are clear 
and the protoplasm has shrunk more or less in the longitudinal 
direction. In some of these there are clear evidences of a 
previously existing continuity in the fimbriated appearance of the 
ends of the protoplasmic mass. 

"With respect to the delicate diaphragm met with at the ends of 
the cells, the fact should be noted that it does not swell up under 
the action of reagents, nor does it stain like the rest of the walls. 
The same may be said of the annular thickening which encloses it. 
The various degrees of perforation exhibited by the diaphragm are 
doubtless indications of successive stages of development, the final 
term of which may be an imperforate diaphragm and a complete 
interruption of continuity. This, however, seems only to occur 
when the life of the cell comes to a close and a barrier is needed 
between the living and the dead parts of the tissue. 

Fucus. 

Among the various forms of Fucus which have been sub- 
mitted to examination, with a view to determining the presence 
or absence of continuity, the chief are Fucus vesiculosus and F. 
serratus. 

The flattened, dichotomously-branched thallus of these plants 
has a minute structure, which very closely resembles that of Asco- 
phylluni nodosum. In transverse and longitudinal sections, the 
epidermis, the cortex, and the central tissue, are readily dis- 
tinguishable, and both in appearance and histological composition 
are extremely similar to the corresponding tissues of the plant 
named. The midrib, a feature not present in AscoplujUum, is 
formed by a greater development of the filamentous tissue of the 
central part of the frond. 



102 FERNS COLLECTED IN NORTH FORMOSA BY MR. WM. HANCOCK. 

As regards continuity the agreement is as close as in other 
respects. Under the influence of contracting reagents the proto- 
plasm of the cells leaves the side walls, but it clings most 
tenaciously to the ends. By the employment of the methods 
already detailed, however, the tissues may be sufficiently swollen 
and clarified to allow the connection between contiguous cells to be 
definitely determined. When this is done, it is found that the 
cells of the central filaments have their protoplasts united, the 
union being efi'ected either through open pores at the ends, or, in- 
directly, through the intervention of one of the sieve-plate 
arrangements described under AscoplujJlum. Continuity is also 
maintained in the layers of cortical cells, as well as in the fibres, 
which arise from them and curve inwards to interlace with the 
central filaments. In a word, all that has been said respecting 
continuity in the previous paragraphs may be applied without 
error to the two species of Fucus now under consideration, and 
need not therefore be repeated.

NOTES ON CEETAIN PASSIFLOBE.E FEOM WESTERN 
TROPICAL AMERICA. 

By Maxwell T. Masters, M.D., F.R.S. 

The following notes refer to a small collection of Passijiorea^ 
made by Mr. Lehmanu when travelling in various parts of Central 
America and New Granada. They comprise the description of two 
previously undescribed forms, and they may serve to extend our 
knowledge of certain species and their distribution. In drawing up 
the list I have availed myself of the careful notes made by Mr. 
Lehmann. Throughout I have cited my monograph of the order 
in Martius and Eichler's 'Flora Brasiliensis,' vol. xiii., part 1, 
March, 1872, in which full synonymy and references to the 
literature will be found. I have also quoted, where necessary, the 
monograph of New Granadan species by Messrs. Triana and 
Planchon in the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' 5me ser., 
t. xvii. (1873), p. 121 ; and my own paper relating to the species 
collected by M. Andre in the ' Journal of the Linnean Society,' 
vol. XX., p. 25 (1882).

In a former communication I have alluded to the different 
arrangement of certain forms of Tacsonia, and to the difl'erent views 
as to the synonymy of the species taken by Messrs. Triana and 
Planchon from those I have adopted. The species, so-called, 
I)robably intercross freely, and the fruit is rarely preserved in 
herbaria, so that there is ample room for difl'erence of opinion. 
Messrs. Triana and Planchon speak of the fi'uits of P. tomentosa, 
under which they include T. qiiitensis and T. mollissima, as "deux 
fois gros comme un oeuf de poulc," yellow, velvetj^ with a pulpy 
aril to the seed, of a yellow colour, a pleasant odour, and agreeable 
taste. The fruit of T. mollissima in English gardens answers fairly

to this description, but is more elongated and ellipsoidal in form. 
The fruits of P. mixta, according to Messrs. Triana and Planchon, 
are smaller, glabrous, always of a green colour, with a brittle 
pericarp, and with less fragrant and agreeable pulp. Mr. 
Lehmann's observation has been already cited, and it serves to 
show — of which, indeed, there is other evidence — that the ver- 
nacular names, Curuba, &c., are applied to different forms. 

Under No. 2624 Lehmann collected a remarkable specimen, the 
flowers of which were in a monstrous condition. As the specimen 
seems to combine in some degree the characters of the foliage of 
T. mollissima with the floral structure of T. pimiatistipula, especially 
the faucial corona, which consists of numerous long threads, I am 
disposed to think the specimen in question to be of hybrid origin. 
The stamens originated from a fleshy longitudinally ribbed cup 
emerging from above the centre of the gynophore, and were pro- 
longed into long stalks terminating in flat petaloid dilatations of a 
spear-head shape and representing the anthers. The conformation 
of the ovary was normal. Mr. Lehmann says of this specimen : —

A NEW SELAGINELLA FEOM NEW GUINEA. 
By J. G. Baker, F.R.S. 

I AM just too late to have intercalated in its proper place in my 
synopsis the following new species, from New Guinea, of which we 
have received, through the kindness of Baron von Mueller, four 
specimens, three of them collected near Port Moresby by Edelfeldt, 
and a fourth on the islands of the south-east coast by Armit. It 
belongs to the Caulescentes group of the subgenus StacJujj/i/nandrum, 
and much resembles a dwarf edition of the widely-spread and 
well-knovfn S. J^abel lata. 

213"'' S. Muelleri, Baker, n. sp. — Stem erect, 6-8 inches long, 
simple in the lower half or third, decompound upwards ; pinnae 
crowded, deltoid ; final branches close, erecto-patent, ^-J lin. 
diam. Leaves of the lower plane ovate-lanceolate, ^-f lin. long, 
ascending, rather imbricated on the branchlets, bright green, 
moderately firm in texture ; base rounded on both sides ; midrib 
central; margin white, denticulate, not anywhere distinctly 
ciliated. Leaves of the upper plane oblique ovate-cuspidate, 
about half as long, much imbricated. Spikes short ; bracts ovate- 
cuspidate, bright green, as long as the leaves of the lower plane.

The Botanical Record Club : pJianerogamic and cri/ptof/amic. Report 
for the year 1883. By the Referees and Editor. Man- 
chester: printed by James Collins & Co. 1884. 8vo, 
pp. 1-76, 253-255. 

Tms Report contains, like its predecessors, much that is 
interesting. Now that the "voucher-specimens" of the Club 
have been transferred to the British Museum, and are thus easily 
available for reference, the semi-private nature of these reports has 
to a great extent been done away with, and the drawback to the 
general usefulness of the work of the Club has been removed. 
The editor is, we believe, Mr. F. A. Lees, although we find no 
statement to that effect in the report itself. The preface contains 
a reasonable complaint that the new county records of preceding 
reports were not incorporated into the new edition of ' Topo- 
graphical Botany.' In some cases, however, the work referred to 
appears to have been carelessly consulted, as in the section 
headed "Record of species not considered worthy of comital 
enumeration in ' Topographical Botany," where, of the first six 
plants mentioned, the distribution of four is duly recorded in 
' Topographical Botany,' 

A large number of the more interesting " new county records " 
have already been published in this Journal. The occurrence of 
Erica vayans in Bulmershe Park, Earley, Berks, " in which park 
are many planted conifers," should hardly appear under this 
heading. The differences of opinion upon certain plants finds 
plentiful illustration : thus, in the Uaniinculus coxfercuidcs of 
Rescobie Loch (see Journ. Bot. 1880, p. 344), Mr. Druce sees only 
" a depauperated form of II. circi)i(itus.'' Mr. Baker contents

himself by saying " not circinatiis," and Mr. Lees thinks it a 
" starved alpine state of trichophyllus.'" The Malvern Rose, found 
by Mr. Towndrow (see Journ. Bot. 1883, 219), appears as " Rosa 
sempervircits L., var. Melvinl Towndrow," without any description. 
Mr. Baker "expects it is a strange stylosa form:" Mr. Lees "does 
not see the difficulty in regarding this as a long-leaved form of the 
Continental semper oirens," and " considers it a nurseryman's 
variety and a stray." We suspect some confusion in the various 
records given for Orchis incarnata. The " new station " given for 
Dentaria will be found at page 185 of this Journal for 1882. 
The circumstances of the addition of Mijosotis rupicola " to the 
flora of the field botanists' classic county " have already been 
given in our pages (Journ. Bot. 1875, p. 26). In connection with 
the recent discussion in this Journal as to the position of the 
Holyhead Senecio, it is interesting to note that a South Lincoln 
form of S. campestn's is described as " tall, 18 inches to 2 feet high, 
lower leaves spathulate on longish stalks, upper spathulate- 
lanceolate, sessile, all cottony, most below, slightly decurrent, 
slightly branched above, with from 5 to 10 long peduncled heads." 
Mr. Lees has " not seen the early radical leaves, but in faces this 
comes very close to the Holyhead plant." If Mr. Lees is correct 
in believing that " the station whence the above variety was 
gathered was the very same as that in which the Rev. G. S. 
Streatfeild first gathered the plant " in 1873, we do not see why it 
is included in the " New Locality List." Indeed we are strongly 
of opinion that a careful examination of this list would greatly 
diminish its extent. As the name of Mr. W. W. Reeves occurs 
among the " deaths," it may be desirable, as it is pleasant, to say 
that this statement is incorrect. 



Sylloge Fungorum omnium hucasque cognitorum. Digessit P. A. 
Sagcardo. Vol. iii. Sphferopsides et Melanconieae. Patavii, 
XV Decembris, 1884, sumptibus Auctoris typis Seminarii. 
8vo, pp. 860. 

We are glad to announce the issue of the third volume of this 
work, for although confessedly only a compilation, it is exceedingly 
useful for collecting together into one focus all the stray scintilla- 
tions of mycological genius in the direction of species -making, 
which have hitherto been too much diffused to enlighten anyone, 
save at the cost of great labour. 

The present volume of 860 pages is devoted to the SpJueropsidece 
and MelanconiecB, including 4212 species, or at least so-called 
species. The only drawback is that — of the majority at least — no 
sane mycologist believes them to be autonomous species. In many 
cases whole genera are known to be only imperfect conditions of 
other Fungi ; hence we must be permitted to doubt whether it 
would not have been Aviser to have referred them to their proper 
species, and not have continued to perpetuate spurious genera or 
species, such as (.'gti.spora, and many others. The present volume 
will greatly assist any future reformer, who, instead of dealing with 
names, will work at the things themselves, and transfer the im-

perfect forms to the species to which they belong. We even venture 
to think that in some instances Prof. Saccardo might have reduced 
bulk by reducing species, as, for instance, at page 108, where 
No. 260, Fhoma vLrvisibilis, and No. 264, Phovia mnumerahUu, are 
evidently the same species, growing on the same host, in the same 
locality, and differ only in name. 

There is a bulky index of 43 pages, which, if accurate, is always 
a great boon, deserving of commendation. Unfortunately, practice 
has proved that the Index to the previous portion of the work was 
not so accurate as it might have been, and even in this we fail to 
see the advantage of an alphabetical arrangement which places 
U, V, Y, K, X, W, and Z in sequence. Not being well acquainted 
with the Italian alphabet, we cannot say if such a sequence is 
usually adopted. At the risk of increasing the bulk we woul,d also 
have been glad to have found more synonyms in the Index, as we 
have sought in vain for something to correspond to Crehella andro- 
pogonis, described and figured by Berkeley many years ago. 
Diplodia salicina Lev., though alluded to under No. 2009, has 
escaped us. Spharopsis Mujipce Cke. (Grevillea, x., 123) makes no 
sign in the Index, and Hendersonia ele(jans Berk, is not to be found 
either there or in the genus Stctf/anospura. 

We would also be glad to learn what benefit accrues to botany 
by the pedantic alteration of the orthography of generic names, 
such as Cytospora for L'ytispora, Ncewospot-a for Nariiaspora, and 
Stecjanosporium for Stegonusporium , especially after having been in 
use for about half a century in their original form. 

The total change of specific names is also made in some 
instances without apparent justification. Under No. 2275 the 
original Diplodia Injaluspora C. & E. is changed to Diplodina ElUsii 
Sacc, and no cause is assigned, although lujalospora does not 
appear in the same genus. On the other hand, by means of 
changed specific names in Asteroma, we get two (Nos. 6 and 56) 
that are identical in one genus. 

Changes are also made in generic names, to which we take a 
strong objection. Why is Tupospura, Fries Fl. Scan, 1835, set aside, 
and Mastoiiiyces, Mont. 1848, adopted ; although, by the way, jlJdsto- 
myces is omitted from the alphabetical index to the genera ? Again, 
for what reason has T/iyrfu'diuni, Mont. 1836, been adopted, to the 
exclusion of Cheiruspura, Fries Syst. Orb. Veg. (1825) ? Surely not 
for any petty personal reason, we hope, although under strong 
suspicion. Already there is a genus Thyridiuin -'' in the second 
volume, and it is manifestly impolitic to employ two names which 
only differ in a single letter. Why should an author with so fertile 
an imagination give us such genera as the following : — L'ytuspura, 
Cytospurina, L'ytosporeUa, and (Jytosporium ; as well as Thyridhivi, Thy' 
ridaria,QM(\.Thy)sidiuvi; or Calosplueria and Ccelospharia ; oi'Massaria, 
]\Jas!iaiiclla, Mtissaruia, and Massuriuvalsa ; or Cryptospharia, CryjAo- 
aphierclla, L'ryptospora, and C'ryptoapurella ! And in specific names 
in the same genus [PIuniKi), why have we (169) tamaricaria, (172) 
tumaricella, (173) tumaricina, and (174) Tamarisci ' 

* Thyridiuin is also a genus of Mosses.

In the "Laws of Botanical Nomenclature" the two following 
paragraphs are well deserving of notice: — "Avoid in the same 
genus names too similar in form — above all, those that only differ 
in their last letters" (p. 27). 

"The essential point in nomenclature is to avoid or reject the 
use of forms or names that may create error or ambiguity, or throw 
confusion into Science. Next in importance is the avoidance of 
any useless introduction of new names." And yet, without any 
assigned reason, the genus Schizothyrium Libert, is changed to the 
more recent Schizothurella Thum. 

Another appeal to law gives us this caution : " To avoid taking 
up names that have already been used, but have not been approved, 
and applying them to genera different from the former" (p. 25). 
It is undoubted that this has been done in the case of Aposplueria, 
Fuckiiia, and Cnjptostktis (called Cyptosticis in Index). In the first 
instance the original type- species is excluded, in the second the 
name is already employed in Pyrenomycetes (see Grevillea, xii. 50), 
and in the last instance the external characters, which justified the 
name, are expunged, and half the original generic characters only 
accepted, under the same name as the whole, in order to avoid 
accepting another name, proposed in 1878, for the genus as now 
adopted. "Perithecia elliptica, innata, cum rima oblongo-lineari 
dehiscentia ; disco carnoso, excavato" — this portion is excluded, 
and in place thereof the following is adopted : — " Perithecia 
erumpentia, globosa vel depressa, pertusa, subinde spuria." 
We contend, therefore, that the alteration is no more nor less than 
the construction of a 7ieiv genus, and applying the old name ; and 
that the name of Dochmolopha, proposed in 1878, has the precedence. 

Nevertheless we are not prepared to contest so strongly the 
principles of classification adopted, as applied to the species 
included in this volume, as in those devoted to the Pyrenomycetes. 
Some exceptions might be taken, without doubt on very plausible 
grounds, to certain of the genera which are made to include too 
much {Phoma, for instance), and others too little. 

We observe that the Hyphomycetes are in progress, and it is 
hoped during next year to produce the first volume of the Hymeno- 
mycetes. With 6100 Pyrenomycetes, 4212 Spharopsidccr and 
Melavconiecc, and the Discomycetes, the Hyphomycetes, the Hymen- 
omycetes, and the iEcidiomycetes and Schizomycetes still to come, 
we cannot fail to contemplate the total in prospect with dismay. 
Perhaps after all this there may remain some work of reform to be 
accomplished. The publication of the present work will at least 
prepare the way, and no mycologist can consider his library 
complete without it. M. C. C.

remarks which preceded Part I. (Journ. Bot., May 1884), are 
applicable to this also.

On dead wood, Bradnock's Marsh (Wk.), July, Mr. Bucknall, 
having seen my specimens, agrees with me that they are identical 
with his. Hitherto recorded only on leaves or herbaceous stems, 
but he believes that he has also found this species on dead wood.

Avhich is stated to be a stage of P. si/Ivatica Schr., by the very 
numerous peridia, not seated on discoloured spots, " spreading 
over the whole leaf, and generally collected into numerous little 
clusters with single ones scattered between them " (Grev. L c). 
Specimens of both, collected by Mr. H. T. Soppitt, now lie before 
me. Mr. Soppitt has experimented with (E. Grevillei, and ia 
convinced that it is the I. stage of P. variabilis. He generally 
finds them both together, the upper leaves^affected by the (Ecidium, 
the lower ones by the Puccinia ; after laying leaves affected with 
the (Ecidium on a dandelion plant, covered with a bell-glass, in his 
garden, he found the Puccinia appear in about fourteen days. Mr. 
Soppitt's specimens of (Ecidium Grevillei are from Grassington, 
Yorks., August. Dr. AVinter's view of uniting P. variabilis with 
his P. Jiosculosonwi (compositarum) is inexplicable.

remarkable.

NOTES ON THE FLOEA OF CEYLON. 
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S. 

The last Part of the late Dr. Thwaites' ' Enumeratio Plant. 
Zeylaniffi' was published in 1864, and, besides completing the 
systematic enumeration of the plants of Ceylon to the end of the 
Vascular Cryptogams, contained two appendices (extending to 46 
pages) of Addenda and Corrigenda, thus bringing the earlier 
portions of the book (which began to appear in 1858) up to the 
date of its conclusion. 

The numbered series of exsiccata, well known as " C. P.," had 
been previously made up and widely distributed by Thwaites ; 
their numbers are systematically quoted througliout the book, and 
are, in the supplements above mentioned, carried on up to C, P. 
3860 inclusive. 

After the completion of the ' Enumeratio ' the C. P. numera- 
tion was still kept on, as new species or varieties were detected in 
the Island, or as further research showed the necessity of breaking 
up some of the previously recorded ones into two. In this way 
164 additional C. P. numbers were given, and the series was 
extended from C. P. 3861 to 4024, which number is absolutely the 
last. 

Many of these additional numbers have been sent out from 
Peradeniya to the public herbaria of Em-ope and Asia and to 
private collections, and not a few have been quoted by authors of 
recent monographs and descriptive treatises. It will therefore, I 
believe, be of use to give a list of them with their determinations, 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 



idd 



as represented in the Peradeuiya herbarium, which in any case of 
doubt must be considered as the type series. 

I may note tliat very nearly all these additional numbers refer 
to plants collected between 1864 and 1869. After this latter year 
Dr. Thwaites turned his attention, so far as Botany is concerned, 
almost exclusively to the Lower Cryptogams, and although his 
collectors brought in a few additional Flowering Plants, only two or 
three C. P. numbers refer to any year after 1869. 

In the following determinations I have been often assisted by 
the staff of the herbariums at Kew and at the Natural History 
(British) Museum and have especially to thank Mr. Hemsley of the 
former establishment, and Mr. H. N. Kidley of the latter, for their 
prompt attention to my enquiries.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON, 141 

In addition to tbe plants in the above list, a considerable 
number of species has been recorded from Ceylon in various 
systematic treatises (and especially in the ' Flora of British India,* 
now in course of publication), which were not included in the 
' Enumeratio.' Of these most were collected by Col. and Mrs. 
Walker, in the years 1830-1840, entirely in the south-western and 
southern parts of the Island, and have not been met with by 
subsequent collectors. Some of their gatherings were garden 
plants however. The collector was MacEae, who had charge 
of Peradeniya Gardens from 1827 to 1830 ; many of the plants 
sent home by him as natives of Ceylon were evidently gathered in 
the gardens, and are nowhere wild in the colony ; whilst others 
are from N. W. India, where he also collected for the Horticultural 
Society. Some of Gardner's plants, collected by him in company 
with Wight in the Nilgiris in 1845, have also been erroneously 
given for Ceylon ; and altogether there is a rather large number of 
names to be deleted in the list of recorded Ceylouese plants. A 
corrected and revised catalogue of the whole flora is now being 
printed at Colombo for the Asiatic Society's (Ceylon Branch) 
' Proceedings,' in which I have taken care to distinguish all 
doubtful natives and erroneous records. 

During the five years I have been in Ceylon, a good many 
species (chiefly Indian) have been detected, especially in the less- 
known portions of the Island, which have not, so far as I know, 
been previously recorded. The greater part of these have been 
met with in my own excursions through the country, but many 
have been detected by my friend Mr. W. Ferguson, F.L.S., 
of Colombo, an excellent field botanist, who during the long 
residence of 45 years in the Colony has lost no opportunity 
of acquiring and adding to his extensive acquaintance with its 
vegetation. Mr. H. Nevill, of the Ceylon Civil Service, has also 
availed himself of his residence and travels in unfrequented 
districts to collect rare plants, and has thus added several species 
to our flora. 

The following is a list with notes of these additions. The few 
new or undescribed species it contains, as well as those mentioned 
by name in the above list, and a few others, will be described at 
the end of this paper. 

Additions to the Floea of Ceylon. 

Tinospora malaharica Miers [Menispermum Lam.). — I can 
scarcely consider this and T. tomentosa Miers [Menispenmim Koxb.), 
to form distinct species, but regard them rather as varieties of one. 
Both are fairly common in the low country of S.W. Ceylon, and 
are not distinguished by the natives, who call them both " Pou- 
kinda," or " Wal-kinda." C. P. 2804 includes examples of both 
forms. In the ' Fl. Brit. Ind.' i., p. 9G, neither are given for 
Ceylon, but in the ' Flora Indica ' of 1855, p. 182, Hooker 
mentions a Ceylon example as probably referable to T. vudaharica. 

T. crisjju Miers [Meniupcniuun L.). — It is probable that this 



142 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON, 

species, which has a great medicinal reputation as a bitter febri- 
fuge among the Malays, has been by them introduced to Ceylon. 
It is known as " Titta-kinda," and occurs in an apparently wild 
condition. In the neighbourhood of Kadawalla, on the Kelani 
Eiver, about ten miles from Colombo, this plant is a striking 
object, wreathing the stems of the Jak trees and Coco nuts with its 
rooted twining stems. In January it was without flowers or fruit. 
This is the Funis pelleiis of Eumph, Herb. Amboin. v., p. 82, whose 
figure (t. 44, f. 1 *) of the characteristic stem is very fair. Scheffer 
has figured as T. crispa, a plant with male flowers from the 
Buitenzorg Gardens (Obs. Bot. iii., p. 71, t. 1), which has a longer 
and more ovate leaf than the Ceylon plant. The localities for this 
species given in the Fl, Brit. India — Silhet and Assam to Pegu 
and Malacca — are in favour of its nativity in Ceylon also. It 
drops down very long thread-like roots from great heights, like T. 
cordifolia. 

Cleome tenella L. f. — On the dry sandy coast at Puttalam and 
Chilaw, W. coast, Nov. 1881. A slender annual which quickly 
dries up and disappears. It occurs in similar places on the 
Carnatic ; has been found in Nubia and Senegal, and doubtless 
occurs in the intermediate desert regions. 

Cerastium glomeratum Thuill. — This familiar little plant is 
common about Nuwana Eliya, 6200 ft., and may be native, as 
appears to be considered the case in similar cases in India. 
Thwaites, however, thought it introduced with grass seed, like so 
many other European weeds in the mountains of Ceylon, and 
omitted it from the body of the ' Enumerafcio.' 

CaJophyUum eJatum Bedd. ? — To this I refer, with some doubt, a 
tree of which the leaves were sent to me in 1882, from the 
Devilane Forest, near Batticalon, by Capt. Walker, Forester for the 
Eastern Province. It has been entered imder this name, in 
Mr. Vincent's Keport on the Forests of Ceylon (Part i., pars. 106 
and 147), the native name being given as " Tombu-kata." We 
have the tree also in the gardens at Peradeniya, but I have not 
seen flowers or fruit. Beddome's species was first named in 
' Trans. Linn. Soc.,' xxv. p. 212, and is described and figured in 
his ' Fl. Sylvatica,' t. 2, and his Forest Keport for 1863-64. It 
yields the Von spars of commerce. In the ' Flora Brit. Ind.' it is 
regarded as a variety of C. tomentosum Wight, which is a very 
common species in the lower districts of Ceylon, and one of those 
called " Kiua " by the Sinhalese. The leaves of the Batticalon 
tree are, however, very much longer and narrower, with a rounder 
base and more horizontal secondary nerves. It may be the 
C. awjustifoliam Roxb., from Penang, of which nothing seems to be 
known. 

Vatica (ibsciira Trim., n, sp. 

Pavonia glechomifolia A. Eich. — This has been recorded for 

* Linnaus has quoted this figured correctly, but has caused confusion by 
accidentally giving the name as Funis quadrangularis, p. 83, which is fig. 2 on 
the same plate. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 148 

Ceylon, I know not on what authority, in ' Fl. Brit. India ' i., 
p. 330. I have since found it plentifully about Tissa-maha-rama, 
an ancient place in the S. Province, formerly of great importance. 
The plant has a wide range through the drier parts of India, and 
extends to Arabia and Trop. Africa. 

Triumfetta cnnspicua Trim., n. sp. 

Grewia jMpnHfolin Vahl. — First sent to me by H. Nevill, Esq., 
C.C.S., in December 1881, from Puttalara, in fruit; and in that 
state not easily determinable. I have found it abundantly in the 
Hambantota district in the south-east of the Island, and it is 
doubtless frequent in the dry coast districts. This is a desert 
shrub, first gathered by Forskal in Arabia. When the fruit is 
symmetrically and completely developed, which is rarely the case, 
it consists of two separable portions, each of which is didymous, 
and contains two bony pyrenes ; the pyrenes are again 2-celled, 
with a very thick and hard partition and a single seed in each cell. 
The fruit is thus normally 8-seeded. 

Bahamodendron Berryi Arn. — Under the Tamil name of " Mul- 
kilivai," this is a well known hedge plant in the Jaffna district of 
the extreme north of the island, and is employed for the same 
purpose along the west coast of Ceylon as far south as Colombo, 
where alone I have seen it. Mr. W. Ferguson, F.L.S., to whom 
I am indebted for the above information, also tells me that it is 
obtained from wild plants in the islands of the Gulf of Mannas 
(belonging to Ceylon), especially from that one named Delft by the 
Dutch, and I regret that I have as yet had no opportunity of 
verifying the statement. In parts of Southern India, however, I 
observed B. Berri/i in vast abundance ; it is used for miles in 
fencing the railway line about Erode, &c., and attains fully 10 ft. 
in height. I did not see any, however, that looked wild. At 
Trichinopoly I succeeded in getting some specimens, and Major 
Johnson, of Mettapollium, has since sent better ones from Coim- 
batore. The Indian plant is very spiny, with thick, horizontally 
divaricate interlaced branchlets (making an almost impervious 
hedge), small rigid 8-foliate leaves with sessile obovate leaflets, — 
the terminal are much the largest, — and little clusters of 2-5 
sessile flowers. As noticed in ' Medicinal Plants,' sub t. 59, this 
plant must be very closely allied to, if not identical with, B. Myrrha 
Nees, figured at t. 60 of the same book, but if it afford any gum- 
resin in S. India it is of a character very different from myrrh." 

As cultivated in Colombo, &c., the plant takes on a very 
different appearance ; the spines are more slender and much less 
numerous, the leaves much larger, usually pinnately 5- or 7-foliolate 
with serrate leaflets, and the infloresence large and compound, in 
divaricate cymes. So unlike is this slender-growing leafy shrub to 
any Bahamodendron (except some forms of B. africanum) that I 

* Beddome, who gives a poor figure (Fl. Sylv. t. 126) of 7?. Berryi, says that 
it forms a good-sized tree in the dry jungles to the east of the Nilgiris, and that 
a gum resin exudes from it. He also notes that the Howers are frequently 
destroyed when young by some insect. I find them generally malformed from 
this cause in Ceylon. 



144 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

was long in doubt as to its identity, and inclined to refer it to 
some Protium. Prof. Oliver, however, to whom I submitted 
specimens, was of opinion that the plant was probably merely a 
luxuriant state of B. Bernji, and I believe him to be perfectly 
correct, the wet climate of Colombo accounting for the change. 

Prutium should be combined with Balsa mode ndron, as is done 
by Wight, Marchand, Baillon and Eugler, under various names. 
Both genera possess the peculiar lobed arilloid investment of the 
pyrene (" mesocarp ' in Med. Plants, t. 59) ; in B. caudatum March. 
[Protium W. & A.) this is very conspicuous, being bright salmon- 
red. 

Vitis tomentosa Heyne. — Found in the forest near Anurad- 
hapura, the ancient capital of Ceylon, Oct. 1883. A rather 
handsome species, with large masses of dark vinous-red crowded 
flowers and tloccose wide-climbing stems ; justice is scarcely done 
it in Wight, Ulust. t. 57. On the mainland it is confiued to the 
south parts of the peninsula. 

Cardioapermnm canescens Wall. — This pretty climber is abundant 
and ornamental in the country round about Hambantota, covering 
the scrub with its delicate foliage and milk-white blossoms. In 
full flower in December. The pubescence is very minute, and 
barely justifies the specific name. The species is found in the 
south of peninsular India, also in Burmah and Abyssinia. 

Ehyiichosia densi/Ioni DC. — Near Tissa-maha-rama S. Province, 
sparingly, Dec. 1882. A South Indian species, which has also 
occurred in E. Trop. Africa. 

Bauhinia Angaina Koxb. [B. scandens li., pro max. parte, non 
Roxb.).— There is some doubt whether this great climber can be 
considered other than as an introduction. I found several large 
masses of it at the foot of Doluwa Kaude, a hill about eight miles 
north of Kurunegala, and it has been reported from one or two 
other spots ; but it has not been found in flower. A very large 
specimen in the Peradeniya Gardens has long been an object 
of curiosity and interest, but this also has never flowered. The 
figures in the ' Hort. Malabaricus,' viii., tt. 29-31, are sufficiently 
characteristic of the " chain-cable "-like stems; the young trailing 
shoots run extensively over the ground and root at the joints ; the 
plant is thus easily propagated either accidentally or by intention. 

Acacia ptanifronsW . & A. — Good specimens of this characteristic 
species were sent to me in October, 1882, from the Island of 
Mannar, one of the most arid tracts in the colony. It appears to 
be so abundant there as to be largely cut for firewood, and even 
exported to India (see Vincent's ' Report on Ceylon Forests,' pars. 
98 & 121). The Tamil name is " Odai," and the pods are said to 
be a good cattle-food. I was greatly struck with the cedar-like 
growth of this acacia in S. India (as seen from the railway), on the 
low rocky hills near Ayyalur Station, between Trichinopoly and 
Madura ; it is well called •' Umbrella Tree " by the English. It is 
also frequent at Tuticorin, and plants have occasionally sprung up 
on the shore at Colombo from seeds brought no doubt with ballast 
from that neighbouring port. Roxburgh's unsatisfactory figure of

Mimosa eburnea (' PL Coromandol,' t. 199) is quoted for tliis by 
Baker in ' Fl. Brit. Iiid.' ii., p. 293, but Bentham has pointed out 
(Trans. Linn. Soc. xxx., p. 512) that it represents a young shoot 
of A. ehurnea. The flowers of A. planifrons are not yellow, as given 
in ' Fl. Brit. Ind.,' but pale creamy- white ; nor are the pods straight 
in A. eburnea, but nearly as much curved as in A. planifrons, only 
fiat instead of turgid, as in the latter species. The expressive 
name planifrons was given by Koenig (sub Mimosa). 

A. ferruginea DC. { Mimosa ]Xo\h .) . — A few trees only at Ane- 
maduwe, between Puttalam and Kurunegala, in the North-west 
Province. Evidently a rare species in Ceylon, as also, I believe, 
in India, where the localities given are Courtallum and the Circars.

THE IDENTITY OF BACTERIUM FCETIDUM Thin 

WITH SOIL COCCI. 

By Spencer Le M. Moore, F.L. S. 

In the Royal Society's 'Proceedings' (xxx. 473), Dr. Thin 
described the organism found in association with profuse sweating 
of the soles of the feet to which he gave the name of BacteriutK. 
fcetidum. In the moisture which exudes from the soles, and which, 
on account of its alkaline reaction compared with the acidity of 
perspiration obtained at the same time from the general surface of 
the body. Dr. Thin considers to be not pure sweat, but a mixture 
of sweat and serous exudation from the blood, Bacterium Jatidum is 
capable of rapid growth, the form assumed bcmg that of spherical 
cocci refracting light brightly and uniformly. Cultivated in sterilised 
vitreous humour, the cocci were found to develop into a series of 
forms, commencnig with wedge- and canoe-shaped bodies con- 
taining each a bright coccus ; thence into short rods bearing a 
coccus or cocci at the ends or centre : these rods either became 
fragmented, the fragments clhiging together in clusters, or they 
assumed ordinary Bacterium and Bacillus form and spored, the 



150 THE IDENTITY OF BACTERIUM FCETIDUM WITH SOIL COCCI. 

spores being in all respects identical with the cocci found upon 
the feet. 

While examining the coccus form of Bacterium fostidum and the 
cocci of surface soil ( " corpuscules brillants" of Pasteur), I was 
struck by the great similarity between them, and determined to 
ascertain wliether the identity were real or merely apparent. That 
there is a real identity the following experiments tend to show. 

Morpholotjical proof of the idenlity of Bacterium foetiduin Thin tvith 

soil- cocci. 

The method adopted was to cultivate, in imitation of Dr. Thin, 
ferment from soil lying immediately beneath the surface, and the 
Bacterium (obtained by scraping fetid socks after a short soaking 
in distilled water), in test-glasses containing vitreous humour. As 
in Dr. Thin's experiments, the test-glasses, provided with glass 
caps and covered by a larger glass, were purified by exposure to a 
temperature above 300° Fahr. for two hours ; the vitreous humour, 
forced through fine muslin, was sterilised by introducing it with 
care into carbolised cotton-wool plugged test-tubes previously puri- 
fied similarly to the glasses, and then kept in boiling water for 
half an hour. The soil, freed as far as possible from traces of 
organic matter, was sifted through fine muslin before being placed 
in a test-glass.* Dr. Thin satisfied himself that his fluids were 
sterilised by the above treatment, and one of my fluids examined 
after a fortnight showed no trace of organisms. I, however, made 
some additional experiments, with the same results as were ob- 
tained with fluids treated according to Thin's method — with fluids 
sterilised in test tubes provided with firmly secured corks previously 
soaked in creosote and turpentine, and kept in boiling water for 
several hours on three successive days. A test-fluid so treated 
remained clear for upwards of two months, and showed no trace of 
organisms when examined. 

After cultivating for two or three days in a warm chamber kept, 
by means of a Page's apparatus, at 9G°-99° Fahr., the surface of 
the liquid in Avhich the Bacterium fcetidiim. was growing, as well as 
of that charged with soil, was covered with a firm resistant scum. 
In the scum of the latter, and in the liquid below it, were found 
the series of forms now to be described. 

At the first stage bright cocci are seen contained each in a 
darker wedge- or canoe-shaped envelope; their position in the canoe 
is almost always a little to one side of the centre, in the wedge 
at the wider end. The wedge or canoe may end either sharply or 
bluntly. Sometimes two cocci are found in association in a double 
semicanoe-shaped envelope, similar to those shown at fig. 3^ of Dr. 
Thin's memoir ; but two cocci, oscillating within a single canoe (seen 

* The vitreous humour, the soil and the Bacterium were introduced into 
the purified test-glasses, uncovered, when held iar hack over an open fire and as 
near to the fire as possible. 'Vhe test-tubes were similarly opened to receive the 
vitreous humour. This method I consider as good as, perhaps preferable to, 
the carbolic-spray method. The cotton-wool plugs were about IJ inch in length.

once by Thin) were never found in any of the cultures. There can 
be no doubt that these cocci, similar in size and appearance to the 
" corpuscules brillants," are identical with them ; their average 
diameter is 1-35 /x. 

In the next stage a short staff-like rod, 5.0 — 6-0 /x in length and 
1-0 jji. in width, has appeared in the canoe, and standing out from it 
at its centre or end and distinguished by its greater brilliancy is the 
coccus. In early stages of rod-formation the boundaries of the 
canoe-shaped envelope can still be traced, but they soon disappear. 
Sometimes more cocci are associated with each rod ; they are then 
usually placed either singly at its ends or paired at its centre. The 
cocci can be traced gradually dwindling away, and finally merging 
with the substance of the rods. 

By simple elongation the Bacterium next reaches its Bacillus 
stage. The Bacilli are of varying length — on an average about 
25'0 /A, but this size is often greatly surpassed, some of them 
measuring as much as 144-0 f*. Already in cultures only three 
days old their protoplasm is, in some cases, divided into a row of 
spores reaching from end to end of the cell. These spores — in 
every way resembling the " corpuscules brillants " — are discharged 
in great numbers by the collapse of their investing sheaths. 

The other method of the rods' growth described by Dr. Thin, 
viz., their fragmentation to form small clusters, was also observed by 
me, but not frequently. 

A series of figures illustrative of the chief forms assumed by the 
soil-ferment in its development were di'awn with the camera for 
comparison with the figures on Dr. Thin's plate. The resemblance 
in every way between the two series was most striking This plate 
having unfortunately been lost, it would not be possible to replace 
it without repeating the cultures, for which I have no present 
opportunity. 

It is necessary to say here that I in no way assert soil-cocci to be 
referable to Bacterium fcctidum, for I quite agree with the remark of 
a great physiologist, that my results would equally prove the non- 
specificity of Dr. Thin's organism as the specificity of the cocci. 

The cocci obtained by scraping fetid socks developed the same 
series of forms as did the soil-ferment, thus proving that I really had 
Dr. Thin's organism to work with — a very important matter, as the 
immediate sequel will show. 

Chemical proof of the identity of Bacterium fcptidum Thin with the 
cocci of the soil. 

This part of the method consisted in testing the chemical 
deportment of soil-ferment, and of the Bacterium, when cultivated 
in various fluids, in the warm chamber at approximately the same 
range of temperature as above mentioned. The identity is shown 
in three ways — 

(i) Both are capable of reduciiuj nitrates to nitrites. — Into a test- 
glass containing soil-ferment growing in sterilised vitreous humour 
was introduced, under suitable precautions, a small quantity of a 
20 per cent, solution of potassium nitrate. After six days' interval 



152 THE IDENTITY OF BACTEEIUM FCETIDUM WITH SOIL COCCI. 

the liquid was tested for nitrite, into which it was fouud that part 
of the nitrate had been converted. Bticlcriuin /(vtiihm, simiLirly 
treated, yielded the same result, but the amount of nitrite liberated 
seems to be less than in the former case, a few minutes elapsuig 
before the starch iodide was fully formed.- 

(ii) Both reduce sulphates tu sulphites, and phosphates to phosphites. 
— Small quantities of a 20 per cent, solution of magnesium 
sulphate were introduced into two test-glasses containhig sterilised 
vitreous humour, charged in one case with soil-ferment, in the other 
with the Bacteriwn. It was ascertained that part of the sulphate in 
either was reduced to sulphite after the lapse of three days. 

Some Pasteur's fluid was prepared without sugar ; after growing 
in it both soil-ferment and the Bacterium, for a few days, part of the 
sulpliate (magnesium) in either was found reduced to sulphite, and of 
the I phosphates (calcium and potassium) to phosphites. 

Into some filtered perspiration were placed soil and four drops 
of a 10 per cent, solution of magnesium sulphate. Part of the 
sulphate was soon converted mto sulphite. Sulphated perspiration 
charged with the Bacterium likewise gave the test for sulphite. 

(iii) Both liberate lanje quantities of ammonia from the Jluids in 
ichich theij (/row. — This was proved by many experiments with 
sterilised vitreous humour, and also with perspiration. In all cases 
a copious precipitate was obtained with Nessler's test, after a few 
days' groAvth of soil-ferment and the Bacterium in the fluids. Com- 
parison of these charged fluids with uncharged test-fluids similarly 
treated, showed that all or by far the greater part of the ammonia 
was disengaged by the growth of the soil-ferment and Bacterium, 
and that none resulted from manipulation. 

In all cultures of perspiration the initial acidity gave place to 
alkalinity, due doubtless to formation of ammonia in them. 

General Considerations. 

According to the doctrine here advanced, access of the ferment 
to the sole of the foot must take place by the penetration of fine 
dust containing ferment through the seams of boots. That this 
does occur is beyond a doubt ; for not only is the ferment of 
universal occurrence in surface soil derived from de230sits belonging 
to all the great geological horizons, but cocci are always to be found 
upon the feet, even under the most cleanly conditions. 

Whether the ferment has any relation of causation to an 
abnormal escape of fluid from the soles is a very obscure problem. 
In the case of people who perspire copiously, the ferment, silting 
through the boots and not assiduously removed, would find itself 
bathed by a fluid in which it could freely grow. "We have seen 
that one result of its growth is the liberation of ammonia in con- 
siderable quantities. But the alkaline reaction of the fluid, being 
doubtless due to the presence of this ammonia, is no evidence to 

* Starch and potassium iodide exposed in the room in which the experiment 
was perfoimed showed not the least trace of blueing until after the lapse of 
some time. 



A NEW GENUS OF MYRTACEjE. 153 

the fluid's consisting of serous exudation from the blood as well as 
of sweat ; it may, and perhaps does, consist of perspiration alone. 
It is, moreover, uncertain whether there is any increase in the 
amount of fluid escaping from the soles of persons suffering from the 
disease ; and if there is, whether such increase may not be due to 
warm weather. It is perhaps not impossible, however, that the 
ferment may be the direct cause of an increase of the fluid, the 
immediate agent being the ammonia liberated by the ferment's 
growth and absorbed into the tissues of the soles. 

Another matter worthy of note is the greater chemical energy 
of the soil-ferment as compared with that of the Bacterium. This 
has already been mentioned in speaking of the reduction of nitrates, 
and it was observed in varying degree throughout the experiments. 
The reason is, I believe, that the supply of soil-cocci to the test- 
glasses was more lavish than of the Bacterium, on account of the 
greater difficulty of collecting the latter by the method adopted, and 
this rule was borne out by inspection of cultures in their early 
stages. Dr. Thin failed to find upon the fetid socks anything but 
cocci. This would seem to show that in perspiration (possibly in a 
mixture of perspiration and serum) the history of the Bacterinm is 
simply a multiplication of cocci. On account of the difficulties in 
the way of obtaining perspiration in sufficient quantity to allow of 
sterilisation, I have not determined whether this is the case. For 
the same reason the experiment with perspiration is to be con- 
sidered as inferential merely.

SHORT NOTES. 

Variation in Ulex europ.eus. — On February 1st I noticed a 
marked peculiarity in the abundant flowers of a whin-bush on 
Putney Heath. On looking closely, I found the vexillum of each 
flower, except one or two imperfect ones, had on each side, near the 
top, a small extra lobe, about f of a circle in shape and about ^ in. 
across, turned back at right angles to the rest of the petal. 1 do 
not find this variation mentioned in the usual test-books. Several 
bushes near had slight attempts to follow this one's example, but 
none had the extra lobe on both sides, and seldom more than a 
pinched-up corner to the vexillum. One bush, 300 yards away, 
had one flower with the peculiarity developed on one side. The 
point indicated does not seem to be touched by the humble bees. 
It makes the bush showy, and if we are to credit plants with 
deliberate intentions now-a-days we may hope the fashion may 
spread. — Donald Matheson. 

Saussurea alpina in County Wicklow. — In the course of a 
week's botanising in the County Wicklow, towards the end of July 
last (1884), it was my good fortune to discover a well-established 
colony of Saussurea alpina, growing in association with Aleheiiiilla 
alpina, in the cliffs above Lough Ouler, on the south slope of 
Tlionalagee Mountain. This, I believe, is the first and only 
station recorded for Satissarea in eastern Ireland. Lough Ouler 
lies at an elevation of 1829 feet above sea-level according to the 
Ordnance Survey, and as I found the plant growing at not more 
than 100 feet above the lake, this would give about 1900 feet for 
elevation of the Wicklow habitat. — N. Colgan.

BOTANICAL NEWS. 



We take the following from the last Annual Report (read 
Feb. 17) of the Herts Natural History Society: — "The council 
regrets that your editor has decided to abandon the editorship of the 
late Mr. R. A, Pryor's ' Flora of Hertfordshire.' He has devoted a 
considerable amount of time and labour upon it, in preparing a 
portion of it for the press, and in the subsequent revision of this 
portion, comprising the orders Futnnncnl(ice(B, Ijerheridacea, NtjmpJuB- 
ace(B, Fumariacecv, and Cnicifera. The first sixteen pages are com- 
plete, carrying the work to the end of NyvipJueacefc, but, judging 
from the labour involved in achieving this inconsiderable result, 
your editor considers that the limited time at his disposal will be 
better bestowed upon other work for the Society. The thanks of the 
Society are due to Mrs. Pry or for the donation of £20 towards the 
cost of editing her son's work. Of this a small amount has been 
expended in the purchase of a few necessary books and the 
ordnance maps of the comity. The council will endeavour to secure 
the services of a botanist competent to carry on the work, and who 
will bring it out in a manner Avliich will do credit to its author, who 
had an almost unequalled critical knowledge of British plants, 
combined with a most extensive acquaintance with botanical litera- 
ture, British and foreign, from before the time of Linnaeus to the 
present time." We can quite understand and sympathise with Mr. 
Hopkinson's difficulties in carrying out a work for which, we 
venture to think, he was not specially qualified ; but none the less 
do we regret that the Society, which owes much to Mr. Pryor's 
generosity, should not see its way to carrying out the work to which 
a great part of his life was devoted. 

Mr. G. C. Druce has issued a prospectus of a ' Flora of Oxford- 
shire,' which he hoj)es to publish towards the end of the year. He 
has secured the help of several botanists acquamted with the botany 
of the county. " The 'Flora' is intended to be not only a cata- 
logue of the county species, with their localities, but also a history 
of them, and of the botanists connected with the University and 
County " ; and the prospectus further states that it will contain 
" about 400 species and varieties additional to those given by 
Walker and Sib thorp." The work will be prmted by the Clarendon 
Press. 

M. a. B. Cole is issuing a series of ' Studies in Microscopical 
Science' (Bailliere, King William St.), which demands a Avord 
of notice. The work is issued in three sections ; that devoted to 
botany, of which only we can speak, is excellently planned and well 
carried out. 

Mr. F. 0. Bower, of the Normal School of Science at South 
Kensington, has been appointed Professor of Botany at the Univer- 
sity of Glasgow.

NEW OR NOTEWORTHY FUNGI :— Part II. 

By W. B. Grove, B.A. 

(Tab. 256, 257.) 

(Concluded from p. 134.) 

44. Leptosplmria cnieirta Sacc. Midi. ii. 318 (1881"*; Syll. Pyr. 
ii. 25 (1883). 

Perithecia gregarious, the matrix dirty reddish, erumpent, 
superficial, globose, ^-i mm. diam., somewhat smooth, shortly 
papillate, black; asci cyliudrical-clavate, shortly stipitate, 90 /x x 
10 //,, 8-spored ; sporidia fusoid, rather acute at each end, some- 
what curved, 25-27 p. X 4-|-5 /x, 3-septate, the second cell slightly 
swollen, olivaceous honey-coloured. (Sacc. I.e.). 

On rotten stems of <'anlnus, nestling among the woody fibres, 
near Three Shire Oak (St.).- The spores reached 30^; the 
perithecia sometimes subconical, opening by a wide pore, at length 
superficial. 

45. MetasphcBria rubella Sacc. Syll. Pyr. ii. 161 (1883) — Lepto- 
sphceria r. Sacc. et Malbr. Mich. ii. 598 (1882) — non Spharia 
riibella Pers. 

Perithecia innato-erumpent, the matrix sanguineo-violaceous, 
globose-conical, papillate, then depressed, | mm. diam., black; 
asci cylindrical, 150 |U, x 7 /* ; sporidia distichous, fusoid, nearly 
straight, 25-26 f* x 4-5 //, triseptate, 4-guttate, hyaline, not or 
scarcely constricted. (Sacc. I.e.). 

On dead stems of Cavdnus, near Three Shire Oak (St.), April, 
May. The broad pale violaceous stain very conspicuous. In my 
specimens the perithecia were globose-lenticular, scarcely erum- 
pent ; the sporidia 32-43 jj. x 5-7 /-t, somewhat curved, obtuse at 
each end, 1- then 3-septate, fusiform when young, but when mature 
with the second cell considerably swollen ; the guttse ultimately 
disappearing, but the sporidia always perfectly hyaline ; para- 
physes numerous, filiform, articulate. On the upper part of the 
same stems were Ophiohoius (tcioii hiatus Duby, and O. porphi/roffu7ius 
Sacc, both easily recognisable by the conical protruding ostiola. 
On the lower part of many, where the woody fibres were laid bare, 
was Leptosplmria cruenta Sacc, from which, however, this species 
appears to be distinct, for the hyaline sporidia were probably 
mature and the habit is different. 

46. Splmrulina intermu-ta Sacc Fung. It. 347 (1878) ; Syll. Pyr. 
ii. 187 {im'd). —Splutria int. B. & Br. Cooke, Haudbk. p. 889. 
Var. ABBEEviATA milii. 

Perithecia collected in short parallel lines, surrounded by the 
ruptured epidermis ; asci long collected into a globose bundle, 

* The ground, on which this and the other fungi mentioned herein from 
" near Three Shire Oak " were found, is actually in Stail'ordshire, but is only a 
few yards distant from Warwickshire and a part of Worcesterwliire.

oblongo-clavate, scarcely stipitate, 50-70 /a x 10-15 fx, without 
parapliyses ; spoiidia clavato-pyriform (like the sole of a slipper iu 
outline) 20-25 [j. x 7-8 /x, very obtuse at one end, more pointed at 
the other, di-tristichous 3-4-septate, slightly constricted, hyaline. 

On Rubusfniticusiis Langley (Wk.), April. This would appear 
to be the form intended by Saccardo iu his note (Hyll. Pyr. ii. 188); 
what its relation is to the Sjiharia ahhrcviata of Cooke (Handbk. 
p. 893) I do not know, but I suspect some mistake iu the 
description of the latter. I find a Hendersonia (? Tluhi West.) and 
a Diplodia with the SpJuertdina. 

47. PlujllosUcta betulina Sacc. Mich. i. 154 (1878) ; Syll. Fung, 
iii. 32 (1884). 

Spots none ; perithecia cpiphyllous, here and there densely 
aggregated, innate, somewhat prominent, globose-lenticular, black; 
sporules oblong, 10 /x x 2^ /x, hyaline. 

On living birch leaves, Eednal (Ws.) ; Fen End (Wk.) ; Aug., 
Sept. Sporules rather larger than in Saccardo, but otherwise 
agreeing. 

48. Phnma ilici.s Desm. Sacc. Mich. i. 525 (1879) ; Syll. Fung, 
iii. 106 (1884). 

Peritliecia punctiform, veiled by the epidermis, black, roundish, 
somewhat prominent, pierced by a pore ; sporules cylindrical, 
rounded at each end, 12-15 /a x 3 |W,, hyaline, often with a globule 
at each end. (Sacc. /. c). 

On dead leaves of lle^v AquifoUum, near Three Shire Oak (St.), 
April. The spores in my specimens were rather larger, reaching 
from 16 to 18 |ix. Perithecia scattered, surrounded by a brownish 
stain, about \ mm. in diam. ; epidermis at first elevated over the 
centre of each in a little white spot, then pierced by the somewhat 
papillate black ostiole. It does not differ much from Phoma 
cijlindnj.ywra Desm. on ivy leaves (Handbk. p. 426, Sj/JuBropsis). 

49. Phoma sanguinolenta, sp. n. — P. peritheciis laxe gre-

opening by a pore ; sporules very long, curved or flexuose, multi- 
septate, hyaline, 90-100 /x x 3i^ /a. 

On living leaves of (Jytisus Laburnum, Bradnock's Marsh (Wk.), 
Aug. With Phyllosticta cytisi and Leptosphairia Lucina. 

54. Septoria dianthi Desm. Sacc. Syll. Fung. iii. 516. 

This I had previously (Jouru. Bot. May, 1884) considered as 
recorded in ' Grevillea,' v. 70; but having by the kindness of 
Mr. C. J. Muller seen the specimens (Cooke, exs. i. 429) there 
referred to, I find them to be widely distinct. They are on 
Saponaria, and may be either Septoria dimera Sacc. or a species of 
Ascochyta.

CEPHALOSPORIUM Corda (1839). 

Hyphasma creeping, branched, continuous. Flocci stem-like, 
rather subulate, coutiimous, crowned with a head of spores.

Eft'used, pure white, floccose ; hyphje creeping, nearly simple 
or branched, bearing alternately rather short, erect, sporiferous 
branches, which are mostly simple, and attenuated above ; conidia 
conglobate at the apices, involved in mucus, oblong or ovoid, 
hyaline, about 3 /x x 2 /a (Corda, ex icone), 8-8-6 ^^ x 1*5-2 (jl

On stems of Buhus, Barnt Green (Ws.) ; of Heracleum, Brad- 
nock's Marsh ; on rotting wood and &> Myxomycete, Sutton (Wk.), 
May — Oct. Heads round, pure white, about 10-12 /x diam., but 
varying in size from age. The long creeping stems are sometimes 
suberoct ; the branches often once, sometimes twice forked, 
30-40 l^ high or more. Corda describes the spores as assuming a 
rosy tint, which no other author has observed. My specimens 
belong rather to Penzig's form, but scarcely differ from Corda's 
figure, except in the more oblong spores. 

60. Aspergillus spiralis, sp. n. — A. hyphis sterilibus dicho- 
tomis, scptatis, efluso-intricatis, spiralibus, citrinis ; fertilibus

GLIOCLADIUM Corda (1840). 

Stem erect, septate, penicillate above, branches and branchlets 
septate, crowned by a common gelatinous head. Spores acro- 
genous, irregularly heaped together, simple, with a gelatinous coat. 

Differs from Peiiicillinni in the spores being produced singly, not 
in chains, but remaining united in the mucous substance simul- 
taneously excreted.

Plowright, Grev. xi. 49, pi. 156, figs, b—d (1882). 

Tufts minute, punctiform, white ; stems erect, flexuous, thick- 
ened above, white ; branches opposite, branchlets whorled, quator- 
nate, crowded ; head of spores globose, white ; spores 5^ /x long, 
conglutinate, oblong, surrounded by a thick gelatinous stratum. 
(Corda, l. c). (Tab. 256, f. 9). 

On the hymenium of an old Stcreum (probably Idrsutuw], 
Trickley Coppice (Wk.), Sept. Stems about 120-180 /x high 
(Corda, 220- — 380 /i) ; the gelatinous heads of neighbouring stems 
unite, even 15 — 20 being thus bound together with one large 
common head. The resemblance of the (jrliocladiHm to the Penicil- 
liiwi is striking, but I could not ascertain that the spores were ever in 
chains in my specimens, and the abundant gelatinous secretion of the 
former is a marked feature, which Mr. Plowright informs me he did 
not notice in the conidia of the Hypomyces figured in ' Grevillea ' 
(I. c). I could not perceive in my spores the gelatinous coat which 
Corda figures ; they measured 5 /x x 2 /x, and were extremely 
abundant. The stems w^ere thrice bi-tri-chotomous, the branchlets 
being parallel and appressed.

This genus requires revision ; the other species mentioned by

 •'•Stach)jU(liiim ci/closporum Grove. — Having foimd fresh specimens 
of this near Three Shire Oak (St.), April, I am enabled to add to 
my previous description (Journ. Bot., July, 1884) that the liasidia 
are slightly thickened and spiculate at the tip ; the spores are 
sometimes not quite round, even measuring 3 /u, x 2 /x. (Tab. 257,

A NEW SPECIES OF CATHARINEA Ehrhart. 

By H. N. Dixon, M.A. 

Catharinea Dixoni Braithw. MS. Description: — In small tufts; 
dark green. Ehizome tomentose. Stems erect, simple, about one 
inch high, naked below. Leaves lax below, rather crowded above; 
slightly sheathing, concave, keeled ; erecto-patent when moist, 
crisped when dry. Lowest small, scale-like, ovate, apiculate, entire ; 
the rest increasing in size upwards, at first shorter and spathulato- 
oblong, above narrower and elongato-lanceolate, tapering to a point; 
not undulate. Nerve reddish, excurrent into a short but decided 
apiculus, toothed at the back above. Leaves not bordered, with a 
single row of sharp brownish teeth, commencing at about one-third 
from the base ; not spinulose at the back. Cells larger and more 
regularly quadrate than in (_'. nndnlata, quadrate below, quadrate- 
hexagonal above and rounded, especially towards the apex and 
margin ; arranged in longitiulinal rows in the disk of the leaf, more 
irregular and smaller towards the margin ; chlorophvllous above, 
hyaline below. Lamella; numerous, crowded ; varying much in 
number, sometimes as many as 'S'l ; occupying much of the breadth 



170 A NEW HABENARIA FROM BRAZIL. 

of the leaf, especially towards the apex ; in section of from three 
to five almost equal cells. 

Fructification unknown. 

Habitat: — On earth, on and aboiit the roots of elms, near 
Nortliampton. First found by the writer, April 8rd, 1884. 

This moss has been submitted to Dr. Braithwaite, who will 
figure it in a supplementary plate to vol. i. of the ' British Moss 
Flora,' and who has kindly informed the writer of his intention to 
name it Catharinea Dixoni. 

It will be observed from the description that it differs from all 
known species of Catharinea, except Atnchum pniaHelum Mitt. 
(Journ. of Linn. Soc, vol. viii. p. 48, tab. viii ; Lesquereux, 
' Mosses of North America,' p. 258), in the absence of border to 
the leaves ; and from all known species in the large number 
of lamella). Whether these two points are sufficient to separate it 
from Catharinea is a question that must be left undecided in absence 
of fruit ; but the habit and general leaf-structure are distinctly 
those of that genus. For the present Ehrhart's definition must be 
widened with regard to those points, so as to include these two 
species.

Cidade de Entre Rios, Minas Geraes, Brazil, coll. H. C. Dent. 

The British Museum Herbarium is indebted for this interesting 
plant to Mr. J. Cosmo Melvill, whose name I have great pleasure 
in associating with it. It is remarkable for the broadly ovate- 
petiolate leaves, and the very short flower-stem bearing one (or 
two) rather large violet and white flowers, and with a spur more 
than twice the length of the stem. The dorsal sepal is five-eighths 
of an inch long, the laterals a little longer. The petals are bifid ; 
the upper lobe about the length of the dorsal sepals ; the lateral 
lobe a little over an inch long, much narrower, and tapering away 
to a fine point. The lip has a short narrow base, ending in three 
narrow linear lobes ; the two outer ones nearly an inch and a 
quarter long, tapering gradually to a point, the middle one broader, 
shorter, and blunt. The long upcurvcd anther-processes are nearly 
three-eighths of an inch in length.

NOTES ON THE FLOEA OF CEYLON. 
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S. 

(CoDtiniieil iVom p. 145). 

Sonneratia alba Sm. — Mangrove swamps at Chilan, on the west 
coast, November, 1881. I am indebted to H. Nevill, Esq., for 
specimens of this interesting addition to our flora. It grows with 
the common Ceylon species, <S'. acida L. f., from which it is readily 
distinguished by the absence of petals, the longitudinally G-ribbed 
calyx-tube, the depresso-tiu'biuate and shortly apiculate fruit, and 
other characters. This adds another to the numerous Ceylon 
plants which, though found in the Malay Peninsula and Islands, 
do not reach the Peninsula of India. 

Blepharispermum petiolarc DC. — Not uncommon about Tissa- 
maharama, Kirinida, Hambantota, &c. A remarkable straggling 
shrub, the woody stem attaining an inch in diameter, and climbing 
by its horizontal branches. It appears to have been first collected 
by Klein in 1796, and his description is quoted by DC. in Wight's 
' Contrib.,' p. 12, where the species is founded. Klein's locality is 
given there as " prope Ugandamalej," in Ceylon. This locality is 
omitted in DC. Prod. v. 368, nor until now has anyone since 
recorded the species for this island, I can find no place with a 
name similar to that above given,''' nor am I aware whether Klein 
ever visited Ceylon. Wight gathered the plant at Courtallum, but 
it appears to be a very scarce species. 

Tithonia diversifulia A. Gray in Proc. Amer. Acad, xix., p. 6 
(1883) (Mirasolia Hemsl.). — This very handsome " sun-flower" from 
Mexico has now become one of the commonest weeds of Ceylon, 
and is always an object of notice by travellers, who of course think 
it a native plant. It attains 8 or 10 ft. high, and its large heads, 
4 or 5 in. in diameter, are of a singularly brilliant yellow. It often 
lines the roadsides for long distances, and in places rivals Lantana 
in abundance, whilst it has a much wider climatic range in the 
island than that extraordinary weed of hot moist regions. It is, 
however, a much later introduction here, for Dr. Thwaites told ine 
that he remembered receiving the seed from Dr. Lindley in 1851, 
as then recently obtained from California ; it has no doubt spread 
from Peradeniya. I see from A. Gray's memoir, above quoted, 
that it has been collected in Mexico near Orizaba and Cordoba by 
Botteri and Bourgeau, and that it is figured in Godman's ' Biologia 
Cent. Americana,' Botany, ii. t. 47, a work I have not seen. It is 
singular that this familiar Ceylon weed should thus have remained 
unnamed till within the last three or four years. 

Lobelia exceha Lesch., var. trichandra Wight (sp.). — In the 
Maskeliya District of the Central Province, at an alt. of about 
6000 ft. This is the plant figured in Wight's ' Icones,' t. 1171 ; it 
is well enough distinguished as a variety by the leaves being per- 
fectly glabrous on both surfaces, the branched inflorescence, the

of the places where I found the plant. 



172 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

pure white flowers, and the anthers with strongly marked hnes of 
hairs. Clarice (' Fl. Brit. Ind.' iii. 427), following most authors, 
makes L. nicutianaifoiia Heyne a distinct species, and gives both for 
Ceylon ; hut I agree with Thwaites (' Enum.' p. 170) that we have 
but one. This is usually densely pubescent throughout (except on 
upper surface of leaves), as in Wight's figure, ' Icones,' t. 1172, 
under Moore's name, L. aromatica. At high elevations, as at 
Nuwara Eliya, where it is a most abundant plant, the racemes are 
very dense, and the flowers pale dull purplish-pink ; but at lower 
elevations the flowers are more laxly arranged, and the corolla 
nearly white, but these characters are insufiicient for even varietal 
distiu(;tion. 

Tijlujihorafl'd-a Trim., n. sp. 

Curdia Fiothii, E. & S. — At Mandagula Tank, four miles from 
the Kumbukan Eiver, in the almost unknown region of the Panuwa 
Pattu, E. Province. Sent to me in fruit by Mr. H. Nevill in October, 
1884. He tells me that it forms a small drooping tree 18-20 ft. 
high. The 0. Baa-burghii of Clarke (' Fl. Brit. Ind.' iv. 138), given 
as a Ceylon species, is, I am informed by Mr. Hemsley, identical 
with C. salicifulia Cham, of Brazil. Some error as to locality was 
l)robably made in Herb. Koxburgh. 

Ipomcr.a hracteata Wight. — As a weed in Liberian Coffee Estates 
near Kalutara, Western Province, March, 1880, Mr. W. Ferguson. 
Perhaps a casual introduction from Southern India, but an in- 
conspicuous species, and readily overlooked. 

1. staphyUnct K. & S. (/. raccmosa Roth, non Poir.). — I collected 
specimens of this species near Kurunequla, on the Dambulla road, 
in December, 1883. It is stated to be a common plant in the 
Indian Peninsula, and also to occur in Assam and at Penang. 

Convolvulus parviflorus Vahl. — This common Indian species is 
abundant near Tissa-maha-rama, but I have not heard of its 
occurrence elsewhere in Ceylon. It has a wide distribution through 
Tropical Africa, Asia, and Australia. 

Str'uja orohanchoides Benth. [Orohanche indica Spreng., non 
Roxb.). — This is a common enough plant in the dry Hambautota 
district. I have also found it abundantly near Anuradhapura, 
N. Central Province. It is especially fond of the roots of Euphorbia 
antviuornvi, an abundant tree in the dry country. The plant is pale 
green, and the flowers white, becoming pale violet when withering. 
All parts of the plant become stained inky-blue if bruised, or on 
long exposure after gathering. The mode of parasitism is precisely 
that of Orohanche. 

Priva Icptofitachya -luss. [Strrptunn asperum Roxb.). — Pretty 
frequent about Tissa-maha-rama, South Province. A weedy plant 
with pure white flowers. Found in the dry districts of Southern 
India. 

Sciacllaria sjncata Trim., n. sp. 

Buerhddcia repanda Willd. — Abundant among the shrubby 
bushes on the sea-shore at Kirinda, Southern Province, and 
attractive for its bright pink flowers. A common plant in S. India, 
and well figured ni W ight, • icones,' t. 1766. The widely-spread

localities of Java, Burmali, Timor, China, and St. Helena are given 
for this by Choisy. 

Suteda maritima Dumat. (C/wna/iodina Moq.), var. — An erect 
variety with slender ascending branches and very short leafy bracts 
by the sides of the " lewayas " (salt-pans) at Kirinda, on the east 
coast, and also at the peninsula of Kalpitiya (Oalpentyn), and 
adjacent islands on the west coast ; in both cases along with 
S. indica and S. rudijlora. Mr. Hemsley agrees with me in this 
name. It cannot be the Chenopodina iiidicn of Wight, 'Icones,' 
t. 1793, which has longer leaves and a more branched habit. 

MoJilana ncmoralis Mart. — This small and slender mider-shrub 
has on two occasions been met with apparently quite wild ; at 
Gonamadde, in Lagulla, an isolated coffee district in the north of 
the Central Province, and at Uma-oya, an unfrequented low-country 
district with no cultivation. I have no idea how this Tropical 
American and African plant obtained so good a footing in Ceylon. 
Can it be native ? 

Fodosteiiion algmforme Bedd. (sub Dicnea), — Abundant in the 
Maha-weli Kiver in several places near Kandy, growing with the 
other species on the rocks, and flowering when the water is low in 
the dry weather ; first collected February, 1881. Our plant is 
beautifully and exhaustively illustrated by Warming — from speci- 
mens sent by me to him — in the ' Vidensk. Belsk. Skr.' G, ii. t. 12 
(1882). Beddome's species is figured in Trans. Linn. Soc. xxv. 
t. 24, and is sufficiently near the Ceylon plant ; Mr. Hemsley, 
however, doubts complete identity, and thinks our form intermediate 
between P. algteforme and P. WalUchu Br.

Readily known from its near allies by its long fusiform fasciculate 
roots. A plant of Western India, figured in Wight, ' Icones,' 
t. 2087. 

PJucnix pnsilla Gaertn. [P. farinifera Eoxb.). — In the dry forests 
about Anuradhapura occurs a dwarf Phcenix which presents some 
points of difference from the common species of South Ceylon, 
P. zeylanica Trim. {= P. sylvestris Thw., non Roxb.). It forms no 
stem, the leaf-segments are longer and narrower and less markedly 
4-ranked, and the lower spinescent ones longer, slender, and very 
sharp-pointed, the green is brighter and paler, and the radius 
rather glaucous. In the female flower the calyx is strongly 
3-ribbed, the ribs running out to the end of the strongly-marked 
teeth. The fruit — which is ripe in April and eaten by the natives 
— is barely half an inch long, smaller than in P. zeylanica, but 
somewhat broader in proportion to its length, blunt, apiculate, 
and, when fully ripe, dully-shinnig purple-black, having passed 
through bright crimson-scarlet. The figure of /'. pnsilla m Gacrtn, 
' Fruct.' t. 9, appears to well represent the fruit of our plant ; the 



174 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

locality is given as "India orientalis and Ceylona" (p. 24). I 
believe I am right in placing P. far mi/era here, at least as under- 
stood by the Madras botanists. I saw this wild in Guindy Park, 
near Madras, but not in fruit. The common yellow-fruited 
P. sylvestris Eoxb., so much cultivated in India, does not grow in 
Ceylon. 

Luiienandra inslijnis Trim., n. sp. 

Pandanus Kaiht Kurz. — To this I refer a Pandanus used abun- 
dantly as a fence plant for paddy-fields at Kanuwana and other 
places near Colombo. The fruit and foliage agree precisely with 
the excellent old figures of " Kaida " in Eheede, ' Hort. Malabar,' 
ii. tt. 2-5, on which Kurz founded his species. •;= I have only seen 
the female plant, and have never detected any fertilised seed in the 
fruit, so that it is probable that we have only the one sex here, and 
that it was originally brought from the Malabar coast. All the 
species of Pandanus are used as fences for paddy, and are always 
grown from cuttings or branches ; they go under the name of 
" wetta (= hedge) Kai/iya." The syncarps of P. Kaida are large, 
resembling those of P. dabius Kurz, 10 or 11 in. long by 6 in. wide, 
dark dull green becoming dull orange, ovoid-oblong and very blunt, 
usually solitary, but occasionally with two or three smaller globular 
lateral ones below ; the drupes are very distinct, the free portion of 
each l^-f in. high, rounded and rather flat topped (bluntly nipple- 
shaped), with very blunt angles. AVlien young the female flowers 
are quite separate down to the axis, and each is composed of two 
or three carpels separated by well-marked grooves ; the sessile 
stigmas are flat, 2-lobed, and slightly reniform. The leaves are 
broad for the genus, bright green with a glaucous " bloom," and 
with very strong white spines pointing forward on the margin, and 
retrorsely hooked on the under surface of the midrib. 

Wolffia arrhiza Wimm. — First detected by Mr. W. Ferguson in 
a pond near Colombo, October, 1880. Occurs in the warm regions 
of all parts of the globe. 

Cymodocea anstralis Miq. (sub HaJodidc). — In abundance, growing 
in the shallow water off the shore at Weligama (Belligam) Bay, on 
the south coast, in December, 1883, along with C. isoetifolia Asch., 
and Thalassia Hemprichii Asch. I could not find any plants in 
flower. G. cillata Ehrenb., and C'. {Pliycayrostis) serrulata Asch. & 
Magn. are both recorded for Ceylon, but I have not, I believe, 
gathered either on our coasts.!

Jlelcocharis multicaulis Sm. — Specimens in the herbarium with

Fanlcum hlcphailphuUiuii Trim., n. sp. 

ChnjsoiKujon muntanus Trim. {Andropogon monticola Schultes, 
A. montanus Roxb. ?). — I am informed by Mr. Ridley that this 
agrees with A. niontunus Keen. MS. in the Banksian Herbarium at 
the British Museum. It was collected by Mr. W. Ferguson 
between Puttalam and Anuradhapura in 1882. This is a Peninsular 
Indian species, and Bentham ('Fl. Austral.' vh. p. 538) appears to 
combine it with the Australian Holcus pan-iflorus Br. (= Andro- 
poi/ou micrantluts Kunth) under the name of Chrysopogon parvijionis, 

Anthistiria prostrata Willd. — A common Indian species not 
noticed in Ceylon till collected by Mr. W. Ferguson near Chilau. 

Sporobolus virginicHs Kunth [Agrostis L.). — This is not an un- 
common grass on our sandy sea- shores. I have specimens from 
Kalpitiya and the small islands off that pensinula, from Chilau, and 
from Kn-inda ; it is also common south of Colombo, but does not 
flower there. A widely-spread species over the warm parts of both 
hemispheres. 

S. humifusus Kunth {Vilfa H. B. K.). — In similar places to the 
last, but less common ; its general range is also much the same. 
Very fine and abundant on Karetivo off Kalpitiya. It is dis- 
tinguished by its narrow pyramidal rather lax panicles, and the 
lowest glume being only one-third the length of the second and 
third. 

S. orientalis Kunth [Agrostis tenacissima L.). — Abundant about 
Kirinda and Bundala, on south-east coast, and also at Kalpitiya. It 
creeps very widely, and, when not in flower, is very liable to be 
mistaken for Zoysia piingens, which often grows with it. Common 
in Peninsular India. 

S. coromandelinus Kunth (Agrostis Retz.). — A very pretty little 
grass, abundant on the sandy coast near Kirinda, but not as yet 
seen elsewhere. Found also in India and Arabia. 

Knteropogon meUcoides Nees in Steud. [IscJmmum Keen.). — This 
fine species was collected in several places near Kirinda. Its range 
extends to East Tropical Africa {^= Chloris simplex Schum. & 
Thorm.), and probably the Mascarene Islands (= / Ctenium 
seycheUense Baker). 

Eragrostis [Harpadine) brevifolia Benth. {Dactylisl{.o&i\.). — Pro- 
bably common in the dry districts. I found it copiously about 
Hambantota, Tissa-maha-rama, &c. There is also an unnamed 
specimen in the herbarium here (C. P. 3250) labelled " Jaffra ? 
Moon." This may represent the PomtnercuUa of Moon's Cat., p. 7, 
a grass which has not been truly found in Ceylon. 

Lepturus repens Br. (L. acicnlatHs Steud.). — Sea-shoro south of 
Colombo, January, 1881; first collected by Mr. W. Ferguson. The 
plant is abundant in places, and will probably be found, if searched 
for, in other parts of the south coast. It is the only tropical member 
of the genus. I find the upper flower of the spikelet frequently per- 
fectly developed ; the lowest glume is very long (over half an inch), 
reaching to the base of the one above on the same side ; during

flowering it stands out at right angles. At this time the spikes are 
more or less enclosed in the leaf-sheaths, and have no tendency to 
break up into joints. The ripe grain is free, but enclosed in the 
glumes, and held firmly between the excavation in the rachis and 
the closely adpressed lowest glume ; the rachis now readily dis- 
articulates, at points below the origin of each lowest glume, into 
short joints. I may add that in the upper flowers the lodicules, 
which are thick, obtuse, or truncate, are evidently attached to the 
sides of the palea, i.e., stipular ; the ovary is very distinctly bifid 
above. 

TeinosUichijum f macidatnm Trim., n. sp. 

Adiantum iithiopicum L. {A. emarginatum Bory). — Mr. Ferguson 
detected this widely distributed fern in abundance above Elgin 
Estate, in Upper Dimlula, in a locality apparently native. But, as 
it was also found growing among the coffee of the same estate, and 
has been for many years a cultivated species in the island, it may 
be well doubted whether the locality is a truly natural one. Some 
foreign ferns readily establish themselves in the warm, moist rocky 
valleys of the cofi'ee districts, and a form of Gymnogramma p('ruviana 
has become a very abundant plant in many such places with all the 
look of a native plant. 

Ophioglossum lusitanicum L. — I first discovered this as a very 
minute form growing in the crevices of rocks at DambuUa in 
December, 1881, during the north-east monsoon rains. This de- 
pauperate state is apparently the (>. gramincion of Willdenow, 
originally sent from Madras. Specimens lately collected at Uma 
Oya, on the course of the Maha-weli Eiver, have broader barren 
fronds, and approach O. vulgatam, of which small forms also 
occur here. The species of this genus seem to have been unduly 
multiplied. 

Isoetes coromandelina L. f. — Collected on Dambulla Hill, 1881. 
I have given a full account of this as a Ceylon plant, with a figure, 
in the volume of this Journal for 1881 (pp. 353, =i= t. 234).

SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS. 
By the Rev. W, H. Purchas. 

The remarks of Messrs. Baker and Newbould in their interesting 
" Notes on the Flora of Matlock " (Jouni. Bot., Nov., 1884), as to 
the absence of certain species from Dovedale and the immediate 
neighbourhood, give me the opportunity of making a few comments 
by way of additions to, or in confirmation of, their statements, 
which I might not otherwise have judged it worth while to set 
down ; and whilst doing this I will farther take occasion to record 
such few additions as I have latterly made to the Derbyshire list of 
species, together with some more localities for those already 
recorded. 

It was a matter of much regret to me that the stay of Mr. Baker 
and his friends at Matlock, and more especially their visit to 
Dovedale, should have occurred at a time when I was absent from 
home, and that I thus missed the pleasure aiid advantage of 
meeting them. I can only hope to be more fortunate should their 
visit be repeated, as I trust it may be. 

A residence of over fourteen years within a mile and a half of 
the upper end of Dovedale (although actually in Staffordshire) will 
necessarily have given me the opportunity of visiting this celebrated 
Derbyshire Dale at all times of the year and during a succession of 
seasons, some of which have been more favourable than others to 
the appearance of certain plants, and thus of becoming acquainted 
with stations of plants which would scarcely be met with in a 
single visit. 

I have not, indeed, recorded all the common species on the 
Derbyshire side of the valley of the Dove with the same care with 
which I have those of the Staffordshire side, on which I am living, 
but I have carfully noted the more uncommon ones as I have found 
them. The present paper will only have reference to such species 
as seem to call for some comment, or for which the mention of 
additional localities or further statements as to their occurrence 
and conditions of growth seems desirable. 

Like Mr. Baker, I have been much struck with the absence of 
many species from Dovedale and its immediate neighbourhood, 
more especially of such as occur freely in the valley of the Wye 
between Buxton and Matlock. Thalictrum monUmiun, Myasotis 
fidustris, and Geraniuin saiuiuineum are examples. 

The scanty clothing of soil on the steep rocky slopes of Dove- 
dale makes it difficult for plants to withstand the effects of 
drought, especially on the more sunny Derbyshire side, which 
,is less clothed with wood or scrub than the Staffordshire side. 
To this cause I attribute the absence of some species. I was 
informed on good authority that I'uhjpodium robertianum, &c., grew 
in some quantity on one of the exposed stony slopes, but that 
it disappeared after the hot dry summers of 1868-70. Certain 
it is that it has not since been to be found on the Derbyshire

side, altliongli existing in very small quantity on the Staffordshire 
side of the Dale. 

The drought of those seasons and then the continued heavy 
rains of a series of subsequent years, by washing away the earth 
from the crevices of the rocks, may have destroyed some other 
species, such as Cotyledon, which, although recorded by the late Mr. 
Edwin Brown in Sir 0. Mosley's Nat. Hist, of Tutbury as growing 
in Dovedale, do not seem now to exist there. Other species, more 
especially ferns, have been almost absolutely exterminated by the 
ravages of dealers and thoughtless tourists. Such is the case with 
Ceterach officindrnm, which, I learn on good authority, was at one 
time plentiful. 

Of Batracliian Ranunculi, aggregate R. peltatus seems to be the 
form which occurs in the pools, chiefly artificial, which are scattered 
over the limestone plateau which separates the valleys of the Dove 
and Wye. — A doubtful form tending towards H. jiorihundus was 
noticed by Mr. C. Bailey and myself between Pike Hall and Grange 
Mill. — R. Drouettii occurs in great abundance in the ponds and 
reservoirs of the Via Gellia. I have noticed it for a succession of 
seasons, but I think it was unusually abundant last summer. — 
R. penicillatus occurs abundantly in the Dove, as has been recorded, 
from Beresford Dale downwards. I have sought in vain, season 
after season, for even a partially-matured carpel. — R. fiuitans, at 
least in the Herefordshire Wye, matures fruit freely. 

Coi-i/clalis claviculata still grows on some of the millstone-grit 
rocks near Birchover. 

Hutchinsia petraa. I only notice this to remark that it has 
become much less abundant in Dovedale than it was some ten or 
fifteen years ago. It is curious that my Herefordshire botanical 
fi-iends have observed the same thing in their district. Perhaps 
the seasons may have in some way been unfavourable, so that we 
may expect it again to become more abundant. 

Canlavdne amara is plentiful in various parts of the Dove. 

I have failed to find Arahis perfoliata in the station indicated for 
it in N. B. 0., namely, between Ashbourne and Okeover ; but it is 
a likely part, from soil and situation. 

The absence of TIdaspi virens and its usual ally, Arenaria verna, 
from all the mine-hillocks which I have examined on both sides of 
Dovedale is remarkable, when we consider how freely they occur in 
the neighbourhood of Matlock. 

Viola Fieiclienhachiana (first record for the county) occurs plenti- 
fully at Fenny Bentley, extending for perhaps half a mile and then 
giving place to F. Riviniana. V. Eeiclienbarhiana begins to flower 
several weeks sooner than V. Ririniana. A diflerence in the form 
and texture of the leaves enables the eye to distinguish these, even 
without the aid of the flowers, in the early part of the season ; but 
as summer advances the distinction becomes less obvious, and the 
diflerence in the sepals has to be called in. V. canina ("Linn") 
Bab. seems to be a scarce plant in Derbyshire. I have only met 
with a few plants of it in one part of Dovedale ; these Avere of the 
larger form, and the colour of the petals was more inclining to

purple than I have elsewhere seen them ; but the species uot to be 
mistaken. — V. IiUck, which occurs in some plenty on some of the 
limestone hills of the Staffordshire side of Dovedale, seems nearly 
or quite absent from those on the Derbyshire side. In general it 
shows a preference for sandstone ; and the Ordnance Geological 
Survey Surveyors report that they often obtained help in detecting 
the boundary between the shales and the sandstone by the presence 
of V. lutea, "a crowded belt of which, perhaps not many yards broad, 
is often seen along the outcrop of a sandstone-bed, whilst not a 
single plant will be found on the shales which come out on either 
side" (Mem. of Geol. Survey N. Derbyshire, p. 4). 

Alsine tenidfuUa used to occur on one of the rocky banks near 
the path-side in Dovedale. In the summer of 1879, however, on 
looking for it as usual when I passed, I found that every one of the 
plants which I had noticed not long before had been taken away by 
some ruthless and inconsiderate plant-collector. Since that time 
it has never reappeared. It is greatly to be wished that such 
collectors would bear in mind that they not only deprive everyone 
else, but themselves also, of the pleasure of gathering the plant 
again. I am glad to say that there is another station at Brassing- 
ton, some few miles to the east. 

Stellaria media, var. umhrosa, Opitz. Hedge-bank at Fenny 
Bentley, and near the railway-station at Ashbourne. 

Hypericum montanum occurs, but not in great quantity. I do not 
think I have ever seen H. humifusum on limestone, and I suspect 
that a starved state of H. perforatum was mistaken for it in 
Dovedale. 

The Malva growing on Thorpe Cloud is M. stjli^estris, not M. 
rotundi folia, which seems absent from the district. 

Tilia / There are one or two scrubby bushes of either T. 
grandifolia or intermedia — it would not be safe to say which — at an 
elevation of over 1000 ft. on one of the cliffs of Dovedale. It is 
difficult to suppose it other than wild. 

Euonymus europmis. Dovedale, in very small quantity, and 
overlooked until a member of my family detected it last summer. 

Geranium smujuineum. I have seen one weakly root of this on a 
rock north of Hartington. 

Ulex Gallii, although preferring gritstone, is not excluded from 
parts of the limestone Ijanks. 

Sarothamnus. Wholly absent from the limestone ; appears on 
the millstone grit at Birchover, about the curious rocks called 
Eobin Hood's Stride, and Cratcliff Tor, 

Trifolium frayiferum. Side of the road between Fenny Bentley 
and Tissiugton. 

Ononis arvensis. Near a quarry on Hollington End, near Thorpe, 
and also in the Via Gellia. 

Prunus Fadus. In some quantity on a stony slope near the 
upper end of Dovedale, and also by the brook at Fenny Bentley. 

Of Ruhi, Mr. Baker notices the absence of suberect forms from 
the limestone. — It. fisstis, the only one of that group which I have 
yet met with anywhere in this neighbourhood, occurs on the New

Red Sandstone at Bradley Wood, a heathy wood on the hillside 
1^ mile E. of Ashbourne, and I know of no station for it between 
that spot and the Staffordshire moorland district N. of this village. 
— In the hedges near Bradley Wood occm-s B. Lindleianus in great 
plenty ; and very sparingly U. umhrosm, which, like li. fi-ssiis, is a 
plant of the Staffordshire moorland, and, with it, skips over the 
intervening limestone district to appear on the sandstone E. of 
Ashbourne. The country to the south and east of Ashbourne seems 
to possess a fair list of brambles ; but as I have had very few 
opportunities of investigating them, and as one or tAvo of those which 
I have met with are not satisfactorily determined, I refrain from 
mentioning more than those, to whose absence from the lime- 
stone tracts Mr. Baker has called attention, li. discolor. Tissington 
and Dovedale, where this was seen by Mr. Baker, are its chief 
quarters hereabout. I think I am safe in saying that, from that 
part of the Ashbourne and Buxton road where it was crossed by 
Mr. Baker and his friends on their way to Dovedale, the remaining 
fourteen or more miles of the distance to Buxton would only have 
shown them one other bush of it. li. discolor is a late-flowering 
species, and very rarely ripens its fruit hereabout. It was killed 
down by some of our recent severe winters, whilst li. pallidus 
seemed unaffected by the cold. Ascends to about 900 ft. near New 
Inns Farmhouse. — R. raviosus Bloxam ! Between Youlgrave and 
Eobin Hood's Stride. A much more prickly bramble than Mr. 
Briggs's Devonshire ramosxis, and I should have hesitated to think 
that they could be the same ; but my plant (and I believe Mr. 
Briggs's also) were named by Mr. Bloxam himself. I have also 
found the same plant a mile or two N.W. of Hartington. — 
Pi. anqdificatus Lees. Bare ; one bush at Sandy Brook, near 
Ashbourne, seems to be this, although abnormal. //. lladula. Mr. 
Bloxam did not regard the form which occurs in Dovedale and in 
other places in this neighbourhood as typical Badula, but rather as 
R. melano.vi/lon Miill. ; Prof. Babington named it Rculula. — R. pal- 
lidus Weihe seems to occur equally on limestone and gritstone, and 
ascends considerably higher than li. discolor. — //. dronetorum, var. 
intensus, Warren. Occurs in the hedges between Parwich and 
Alsop-en-le-dale ; verified by Bloxam. A slender form with remark- 
ably narrow leaves belonging to the dumetorwii group occurs in 
Dovedale, near the rock called " Pickering Tors." Well-marked R. 
ccesius, var. pseudo-idceiis, occurs in one of the limestone woods of the 
Via Gellia, called Griff Wood ; also by the roadside near Hipley 
Eock, between Tissington and the High Peak Eailway. 

Rosa micrantha has not, I think, been recorded for Derbyshire. 
It occurs a mile or two from Ashbourne, on the Derby Eoad. — 
li. cfcsia occurs sparingly in Dovedale, but, growing in shade, is 
easily overlooked when out of flower.

SHORT NOTES. 

Crocus Korolokowi in Afghanistan. — This rare Crocus has 
been recently obtained by Mr. W. Simpson, in his travels in 
Afghanistan. He collected a few specimens at Bala Murghab, on 
the level ground of the valley, G3'^ E. long, and between 35° and 
36"" N. lat., where he found the plant growing in great quantities. 
This extends its range further east, as Mr. Maw gives its distribu- 
tion as between 40° and 45° N. lat. and 67° and 71° long., mention- 
ing it as the most eastern of the yellow species. His specimens 
were received from Prof. Kegel, without any record of date, but 
from their characters he inferred them to be vernal species. This 
inference is proved correct by Mr. Simpson, who states that the 
specimens sent by him to the British Museum were collected at the 
end of January or beginning of February. He states that the 
leaves have in the fresh state a row of pale spots along each 
margin, forming a most delicate and beautiful border. This, 
however, has disappeared in the dried plants. — H. N. Ridley. 

Unusual form of attempted Conjugation in Spirogyra. — Early 
in May, while examining some Spiroiji/ra in a vigorous state of growth 
and conjugation, I observed an appearance which is perhaps suffi- 
ciently remarkable to deserve mention. Two filaments lay parallel, 
and several cells of one were connected with the cells in the other 
opposite to them by the usual processes, but communication was 
not yet established between the two cells. So far all was regular, but 
the peculiarity occurred in one case. Let us call one pair of cells 
a and a' ; and let the cell adjoining a in its filament be h, and b' be 
opposite to b in the other filament, and therefore adjacent to a'. It 
was seen that h' had failed to send out a process, but b had sent out 
two. One, situated near the end of b remote from a, was short but 
straight : the other protruded from a part of b near to a ; it pro- 
ceeded straight for some distance, and then turned sharply round 
at right angles, until it reached the junction of the two processes 
prom a and a', both of which processes it seemed to touch. It was 
impossible to feel sure that the contact in both cases was more 
than optical : a triangle was seen, bounded by the walls of the 
three processes. But it would seem beyond doubt that the process 
from h, disappointed as it were in finding no response from its 
infertile neighbour //, was led to turn aside by the joint or separate 
influence ot a and a'. I regret that I found it impossible to keep 
the filaments alive. It would have been interesting to see what 
fructification would have resulted. — Sylvanus J. Hunter, S. J. 

NiTELLA capitata Ag. IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE.— We liavc rcccived 
from Mr. Alfred Fryer specimens of this species, collected in May, 
1885, in one of the ditches in " The Washes." These are the first 
satisfactory specimens we have seen from Britain, although Brami 
has referred plants from Kent, Anglesea and Kerry to this species. 
We hope to give a full description and figure in a subsequent 
number. In the living plant the mucilaginous covering of the

Die Pilz thiere oder Sehleimpilze. Von Dr. W. Zopf. [Encyclopnedie 
der Naturwissenschaften. Breslau, Eduard Trewendt, 1885] . 

Owing to the advances made in our knowledge of the Mycetozoa 
since De Bary's remarkable work (1864), and also to the fact that 
Eostafinski's Monograph of the group is written in Polish, and thus 
inaccessible to most botanists, the want has arisen of a treatment 
of these organisms embodying the scattered results of the last 
twenty years' work. Dr. M. C. Cooke has given us an extract 
from Eostafinski's Monograph, so far as it has reference to species 
found in Great Britain ; but the student of the group demands 
more than such a glimpse into this comprehensive work, and it is 
to be regretted that the whole Monograph was not then rendered 
into intelligible language. 

In De Bary's ' Vergleichende Morphologic und Biologic der 
Pilze, Mycetozoen und Bacterien,' published last year, the group 
received the same treatment as the others in the book, and this 
had the special interest of being furnished by the author of the 
work which first threw light upon the life-histories and relation- 
ships of these extraordinary organisms. 

Dr. Zopf has divided his present treatise into three sections ; 
the first dealing with the Morphology and the second with the 
Physiology. These parts of the subject are thoroughly dealt with, 
and of very special interest. De Bary's recent discussion (just 
referred to) of the same subject perhaps makes one feel less 
indebted than one should to Dr. Zopf for his painstaking and 
original labour. The third section, which is perhaps the most 
valuable, is devoted to the systematic grouping of the Mycetozoa. 
Dr. Zopf's classification is as follows : —

It will thus be seen that Dr. Zopf has found it necessary to 
modify Kostafinski's classification. Following the above order the 
author goes over the whole series in detail, giving a short, and as a 
rule very clear, account of each form. Perhaps it should be known 
that this very comprehensive and well illustrated account of the 
morphology and physiology, and complete systematic treatment of 
a group of organisms as interesting as they are obscure, has been 
produced in handy form at the price of five shillings. Gr. M.

Any contribution to the literature of this subject made by an 
author educated in Botany is pretty sure to be distinguishable at 
once from the work of a pathologist. The one recognises througli- 
out that the organisms lie treats of are plants more or less like 
certain allies ; while the other apparently regards them as a set of 
objects by themselves, to be classified in peculiar ways and after no 
botanically acceptable fashion. No doubt our ignorance of the

life-histories of the Schizoinycetes stands in the way of a satisfactory 
botanical classification, but that is decidedly no reason for adopting 
bases of arrangement which have been long discharged from 
service in Botany. Dr. Zopf has divided his book into four sections, 
dealing with the morphology, physiology, methods of investigation, 
and systematic arrangement respectively. He divides the group 
thus : — 



I. CoCCACEiE 

Gen. 1. Streptococcus. 

2. Merismopedia. 

3. Sarcina. 

4. Miciococcus.

2. Spirillum. 

3. Leuconostoc. 

4. Bacillus.

6. Clostridium. 

III. Leptoteiche^. 
Gen. 1. Crenothrix. 

2. Beggiatoa. 

3. Phragmidiothrix. 

4. Leptothrix. 

IV. ClADOTEICHE/E. 

Gen. 1. Cladothrix. 



The author, who, by the way, accepts the Spirilhim CholercB 
Asiaticce (which is doubtless the defeated comma- shaped Bacillus 
of Koch's researches), deals concisely with the pathological 
literature. The book is clearly written, and excellently illustrated. 
A very useful catalogue of the literature of the subject is to be 
found at the end. G. M. 



Die Methoden der Bacterien-Forschung. Von Dr. Ferdinand Hueppe. 
(Kreidel. Wiesbaden, 1885). 

Db. Hueppe, who is a pupil of Dr. Koch's, has gathered together 
into a handy form a very useful body of information on the subject 
of the methods of investigating Bacteria. Much of this information 
has been collected from sources difficult of access, and the whole 
has been judiciously arranged by the autbor, who shows a wide and 
intimate knowledge of the methods in use. The methods of stain- 
ing and cultivating, the principles of sterilization, the relation of 
Bacteria to decomposition and to disease are very fully discussed, 
as well as the general Biology of the group. The illustrations of 
apj)aratus, &c., are a useful feature of the book. The author has 
done excellent service in not only gathering together, but in 
selecting the materials for a book which is sure to be welcome 
among students of the important group of Schiwmijcetes. G. M.

the production of it. The arrangement of the book is a novel one, 
and no doubt this attracted those who are responsible for its 
appearance quite as much as its other merits. The arrangement is 
as follows : — Part I. deals with Morphology; the root, stem, leaves 
(flower, fruit, seed), and hairs at considerable length. Part II. is 
devoted to Systematic Botany, the higher plants only, (1) Mono- 
cotyledons and (2) Dicotyledons being dealt with in detail. Part III. 
is occupied with an admirable account of fertilisation by wind and 
by insects, and the transport of seeds, &c., by water, wind, and 
animals. Part IV. contains Anatomy (the cell and the tissues) and 
Physiology. In Part V. we come again to Systematic Botany, 
beginning with the lowest plants (for which the student has been 
prepared by Part IV. ) and ascending to the higher plants again — 
the groups being dealt with very shortly. 

It will be obvious that the learner is thus gradually introduced 
to the more difficult branches of the study — and this, I venture to 
think, might have been better done by going steadily down from 
the highest to the lowest plants. With this exception and the 
farther one, that the reviser might with advantage have taken 
liberties with the classification so as to bring it out of the German 
land of darkness in systematic affairs, the book is wholly to be 
recommended. It will be specially serviceable to those who study 
Botany at their leisure away from classes of instruction, and the 
regular student will certainly find it a pleasant introduction as well 
as a thorough one to all branches of the science. In spite of its 
being a translation, it is by far the most readable text-book of its 
kind that we have, and decidedly it is the best-illustrated. 

The first part of Messrs. Bower and Vines' Practical Botany is 
a valuable addition to our literature in these days, when a new 
departure has been taken in the methods of teaching Botany in this 
country. The book is, as its name sets forth, very practical, and 
very well fitted for its purpose. G. M. 



A Flora of the Em/Iish Lake District. By J. G. Baker, F.K.S. 
London : Bell & Sons, 1885. 8vo, pp. vi. 262. 

The English Lake district presents so many features of interest 
to the botanist that it is somewhat strange there should have been 
hitherto no connected account of its Flora. " A mountainous tract 
with a distinct physical individuality of its own, and with a distinct 
botanical individuality, both in respect of the plants that are present 
and those that are rare or absent," — we quote from Mr. Baker's 
preface, — it does not correspond exactly with Mr. Watson's Lake 
Province, the district included " extending northward and eastward 
to AUonby, Wigton, Penrith, and Tebay," but excluding "the low- 
lying northern half of Cumberland, often called the Plain of Carlisle, 
and the western slope of the Pennine Chain through Cumberland 
and Westmoreland." 

It would be impertinent to attempt a detailed criticism of a flora 
of this kind unless the critic had himself an intimate acquaintance 
with the district to which it pertains ; and such an acquaintance 



190 NOTICES OF BOOKS. 

cannot be claimed by one whose visits to the Lake Country have 
been as "few and far between" as those of the present writer. 
But it may be well, in drawing attention to this welcome addition 
to our local floras, — which fortunately appears in good time for use 
during the present season, — to point out that it differs materially 
from works of the same kind in its mode of treatment. Instead of 
the elaborate system of more or less numerous districts and sub- 
districts which have found favour with recent workers, Mr. Baker 
summarises the distribution of each plant in a manner which at 
first sight strikes the reader as somewhat superficial. But it is 
only at first sight that such a view can be entertained. Mr. Baker's 
knowledge and experience as a field botanist, a herbarium student, 
and a practised botanical author, have enabled him to condense his 
information in a manner which, we think, few could successfully 
imitate. His "leading purpose," as Mr. Watson said of his 
' Topographical Botany,' "is to adduce and arrange personal testi- 
mony in a very condensed form " ; and he has succeeded in this 
without losing, as far as we are able to judge, any important 
details. The generalising faculty here displayed, evident in the 
various monographs with which the author has enriched con- 
temporary botanical literature, has always seemed to us one of 
Mr. Baker's strongest points, the only disadvantage connected 
with it being that those possessed of less intimate acquaintance 
with their district may be led to attempt to generalise from in- 
sufficient data concerning the plants of their neighbourhood. 

The Flora of the Lake district is intended by its author as a 
field book, rather than as a volume for the study ; and to this must 
be attributed the comparative absence of such notes on the life- 
history of the plants recorded, which made Mr. Briggs' ' Flora of 
Plymouth ' improving and instructive reading even to those who 
were quite unacquainted with Devonshire botany. Not that even 
these are altogether wanting ; while the topographical and biblio- 
graphical introduction is excellently done. This inadequate notice 
will, we hope, draw the attention of our readers to a work which is 
indispensable to the students of English plants.

ON SPARGANIUM NEGLECTUM. 
By W. H. Beeby. 

(Tab. 258.) 

Sparganium NEGLECTUM Beebj (Journ. Bot. 1885, p. 26). — Eoot- 
stock soboliferous. Eoot-leaves 3-5 feet long, triquetrous at their 
base, channeled on the upper side and keeled almost throughout, 
rigid, erect, never flaccid nor floating even in running water, 
exceeding the flower stem. Stem-leaves, which are somewhat 
channeled in their lower half, and bracts, usually keeled to their 
apex. Inflorescence a compound spike, each branch bearing 1-3 
female heads with many male heads above them. Fruit nearly or 
quite sessile, obovate-pointed, sometimes narrowly so, or when two- 
seeded roundly obovate, generally rather more than twice as long 
as broad (excl. l)eak), not truncate, but narrowed gradually into 
the beak,* which is |— f, commonly -|, the length of the fruit 
itself; slightly obtusangular by compression, with a terete trans- 
verse section, its epicarp of numerous small cells, which continue 
dense and compact in the ripe fruit, and thus conceal the ridges of 
the endocarp. Female perianth scales linear, with a broad spathu- 
late apex. Herbage drying a more or less pale green. 

The habit is much that of S. ramosxua Curt., which, however, 
differs from the above conspicuously in the form of the fruit, as 
well as in the structure of its ei^icarp, which is composed of a few 
large loose cells ; in the ripe fruit these collapse somewhat into the 
furrows between the ridges of the endocarp, thus allowing the 
latter to be prominent, and giving to the fruit its angular appear- 
ance and irregular transverse section. The female perianth scales 
are mostly ligulate, more membranous, and scarcely or not at all 
enlarged at the apex, and the fruit is more frequently two-seeded 
than in S. ncglectum. The upper leaves and bracts are less harsh 
and more leathery in texture, the latter usually quite without a 
keel, and drying blackish or olive-green. 

No allusion to the fruit is made by Hudson (Fl. Ang. ii. p. 401) 
in his description of S. ramosum, and his plant may perhaps best 
be regarded as an aggregate, including that now described and the 
S. ramosxLin Curtis (Fl. Lond. f. 5, pi. 342, and description), which 
latter is also the ramosum of Syme (E. B. iii.), and apparently of 
most authors. I do not now feel sure which plant is represented 
by Reichenbach's plate (see p. 26, ante). The description by 
Leighton (Fl. Shropshire), " h'uit ovate-acuminate, angular by 
compression,' and that of Garcke (Fl. Nord und Mittel Deutsch- 
land), " fruit long-beaked," point to the present plant as the one 
actually seen by those authors ; and these are the only references 
I have met with which seem applicable to nci/lectum. 

I do not find that S. nci/lectwii has any characters in common 
with <S. siiiipJex beyond the pointed apex to the fruit and its 
long beak. 

* The term beak is restricted to the persistent style, exclusive of the stigma, 
which is also sometimes persistent.

194 RECENT ADDITIONS TO THE BRITISH LICHEN-FLORA. 

Besides from Surrey, where there are many stations, of which 
I may mention New Pond, Merstham, and the boj^gy meadow west 
of Eeigate Heath, I have seen specimens from E. Sussex (H. T. 
Mennell) ; and tliere is a plant from Mrs. Eobinson's Herbarium 
at the British Museum, witliout locaUty, named S. ramoswii by 
Eev. Gr. E. Smith. I have seen immature specimens, probably 
referable to this, from S. Essex, E. Suffolk, Hunts or Cambs,, 
Worcester, and Salop. A plant in Hb. Brit. Mus., collected by Dr. 
Trimen at Lowestoft in 1859, and placed by him on a sheet of 
S. simplex, with the remark, " vide length of anthers and beak of 
fruit," is doubtless the early state, with which I am yet scarcely 
acquainted. 

The only continental specimens seen, which are certainly 
referable to S. ne(/lectuin, are the following : — Marais de Gourze, 
Vaud, Switzerland, leg. Blanchet (in Herb. Kew) ; Antibes, Alpes 
Marifcimes, France (Herb. Thuret in Paris Herbarium), and Senart 
(France?), 1822 (Herb. Brongniart, with the last). Ripe fruit of 
the two last was kindly sent me from Paris last month by 
Mr. George Nicholson ; it is quite undistinguishable from that of 
the Surrey plant, and Mr. Nicholson tells me that the habit is 
the same. 

A plant from Pancorvo, Spain (Hb. Shuttleworth, Brit. Mus.) 
may belong here ; the fruit, however, is not ripe, and, while not 
rawosion, the possibility of the occurrence of other forms makes it 
unadvisable to speak more definitely. All the above are under the 
name S. ramosnm Huds., with the exception of Dr. Trimen's 
Lowestoft plant. 

Prof. Asa Gray writes that specimens sent him were referred to 
Mr. S. Watson, who reports (December, 1884) that they " do not 
accord with any American form we have." The known distribution 
is therefore confined to the Old World, and to Europe. 

I desire to express my indebtedness to the various authorities, 
both British and continental, who have so kindly examined speci- 
mens and reported upon them. With one exception here, all 
the opinions received are in favour of regarding Spanjunium 
mylectUDi as a distinct species. 



Description of Plate. — 1. Sjmrganium necjlectmn, from a Reigate si^ecimen

numerous as usual, several of them are in various respects very 
interesting. The new species have, as usual, been recorded by me 
from time to time in ' Grevillea.'

SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS. 
By the Rev. W. H. Purchas. 

(Concluded from p. 184). 

Pyrns nipicola. Mr. Baker did not see this on the Derbyshire 
side of Dovedale ; had time allowed him to penetrate farther up the 
Dale he would have fallen in with numerous small trees of it. 
Many of them grow in maccessible situations, but all which I have 
been able to examine belong to P. rupicola. — True P. Aria exists, 
as Mr. Painter stated on my authority, as a single tree at the edge 
of a plantation near the fifth milestone on the road from Ashbourne 
to Buxton, but it has the appearance of having been planted ; the 
tree is an old one, and flowers freely, but there are no traces of 
young seedlings. 

Epilobiniii rosew)! occurs sparingly at Fenny Bentley. The late 
Rev. G. E. Smith told me also that it grew near Osmaston, by 
Ashbourne, but it is a scarce plant in the district. — E. ohacurum 
occurs also at Fenny Bentley, in company with E. montanum. 
Some few specimens growing with E. montanum and E. obscuriim at 
Fenny Bentley have much the appearance of being hybrid between 
these two, although chiefly akin to E. montanum. I have also 
found on the hanks of the Dove a form having characters inter- 
mediate between E. parcijiorum and E. obscimnn. Specimens of 
this were lately sent to the Botanical Exchange Club with other 
intermediates between these two species from this part of Stafford- 
shire. — E. palustre, which is common in the Staffordshire moor- 
lands, seems wholly to avoid the limestone. 

Mi/rinpJn/lhim sjiicatum. Li the Reservoirs at Cromford, where 
my attention was called to it last year by Mr. C. Bailey. 



SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS. 197 

Callitriche vema. In the Eiver Bradford, at Youlgrave. See 
B. E. C. Report for 1876, p. 18. — C. pUttycurpa is the commoner 
plant in this neighbourhood. 

Fdht's alpinnm. Plentiful in several parts of Dovedale ; strictly 
dioecious. The frequency with which this occurs in the old cottage 
gardens, together with the fact that some of the Dovedale localities 
where it occurs most plentifully are near some of these old cottage 
gardens, made me for some time to question its claims to be 
considered native here ; but farther search has shown me colonies 
of strong old bushes of both sexes in nooks and clefts where there 
is little suspicion of human agency. In Staffordshire it occurs in 
the neighbouring valley of the Manifold (limestone), near Wetton 
Mill. I haue always been puzzled to account for the frequency of 
this plant in old cottage gardens. Its fruit is worthless, and even 
the stamiuate plant, which is much more showy than the pistillate, 
is hardly so much so as to make it valued as an ornamental shrub, 
In Herefordshire, where the plant is sometimes seen in hedges, 
I only observed the pistillate form. 

Saxifrarja granulata is quite a feature in the pastures in the early 
summer. 

Chri/susjilcnium alternifolium. ' Banks of the Dove, in one or two 
spots, but rather scarce ; also on the banks of a brook between 
Ashbourne and Fenny Bentley. 

Parnassia. Dovedale and some of the tributary valleys, but not 
in the abundance in which it occurs near Buxton. 

Seclum acre so abounds on some of the stony hillsides of Dovedale 
that in early summer they are perfectly yellow with it. 

Sanicula curopcm. Scarce in the district, but it occurs in Biggin 
Dale, a tributary of the valley of the Dove. 

Pimpinella magna is more common than P. Saxifrarja in these 
parts. 

Torilis infcsta is recorded from Dovedale in Sir 0. Moseley's 
Nat. Hist, of Tutbury. I have not myself met with it. 

Conium maculatum. Banks of the brook near the Callow, Ash- 
bourne, in plenty, 1884. 

Cardmis hcterophyUus Linn. Dovedale and Beresford Dale. 

Centa7irea Scabiosa. With white flowers at Brassington Rocks. 

Artemisia vuJijaris is very scarce on the limestone, and is wholly 
absent from Dovedale and its immediate neighbourhood. It occurs 
on the New Red Sandstone E. of Ashbourne. 

Senecio sylvaticns, which entirely avoids the limestone, occurs on 
the coarse millstone grit about Birchover and Stanton, notably at 
the curious rocks called Robin Hood's Stride. — S. erucifolius. The 
spot where Mr. Baker noticed this, near the Peveril Inn, is the only 
station I know of for many miles around. 

Chrysanthemum Leucantliemum affects the crevices of the limestone 
rocks, as well as being frequent in grassy places. 

The absence of Leant udon hirius is remarkable. It was only 
after special search that I found it on one of the limestone slopes 
on the Staffordshire side of the Dove Valley. On the Derbyshire 
side I have not yet been able to meet with it. 



198 SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS. 

Taraxacum officinale, var. pahistre, occurs in a swampy part of 
Dovedale. 

Crepis paludosa. Near the source of the Dove, and I think on 
the Derbyshire side of the stream, but ceasing when the hmestone 
is reached. 

Uieracmm. Mr. Baker remarks on the absence of H. murornm 
and H. ca'sium. The plant, however, which Mr. Baker regards as 
H. caimim, var. Smithii, occurs on the rocks of Dovedale, ascending 
to nearly 1100 ft, and has been recorded by Mr. Painter. I first 
met with this, some twenty years ago, on the rocks of Middleton 
Dale. Mr. Baker, to whom I lately sent some Dovedale specimens, 
considers it identical with the plant of the limestone rocks of York- 
shire, and to be truly H. ccedum, var. Smithii. Dr. Boswell, on the 
other hand, as confidently refers it to H. pallidum. Between these 
opinions it is not for me to attempt to decide. I will only say that 
the Derbyshire (and Staffordshire) plant is very glaucous, and that 
the leaves are much more suddenly narrowed at the base than in 
Dr. Boswell's Fifeshire H. p(dlidum; and with radiating teeth, 
which, as in that, are often half an inch long. On the other hand, 
the Derbyshire plant differs notably from a Herefordshire plant 
which I have known for many years, and of which examples 
pronounced by Mr. Baker to be iJ. c^sMtm were sent to the Botanical 
Exchange Club by the Eev. A. Ley (see Eeport for 1882). The 
leaves of this plant from the limestone rocks of the Herefordshire 
Wye Valley are broader in outline than those of the Derbyshire 
plant, and, instead of long radiating teeth, have scarcely more than 
denticulations on their margin ; the Derbyshire plant also wants 
the reddish purple so noticeable on the under surface of the leaves 
of the Herefordshire " H. ccBsium.'' I have met with this Derbyshire 
HieraciuDi. at Linton, N. Devon, and on rocks near Tenby, from 
which latter place it was recorded by Mr. E. Lees in the 'Phytolo- 
gist,' 0. S., 1853, p. 1018. It is a form which departs from 
H. murorum rather in the direction of H. amjlicum than of H. 
sylvaticum.. — True H. murorum, seems to be very rare in Derbyshire ; 
I have, however, met with it well marked between Miller's Dale 
and Cressbrook, as also in Ashwood Dale, Buxton, but in small 
quantity only. I have cultivated this Ashwood Dale plant for 
several seasons side by side with the green typical H. viurornm from 
the woods of Herefordshire, and I can see no farther difference than 
that the Ashwood Dale plant has just a slight tendency to be 
glaucous. — The form of H. vuhjatum, which Dr. Boswell has distri- 
buted under the name of "/i. rusulatum" from Fifeshire, occurs 
with the type on the rocks of the Dove Valley. — H. umhellatum. 
On the Yoredale Eocks of the upper part of the Dove Valley, 
I think on both the Derbyshire and tStaflbrdshire sides of the 
stream, which is there very narrow, but ceasing when the limestone 
is reached. 

Jasione montana, like the last, occurs freely on the Yoredale 
Eocks of the upper part of the course of the Dove ; but I have 
never seen it on the limestone, and I think there must be some 
mistake as to its having been met with in Dovedale. On the 
millstone grit at Eobin Hood's Stride, near Birchover. 



SOME MORE NOTES ON DOVEDALE PLANTS. 199 

Vaccmium MyrtiUus usually avoids the limestone, especially 
when close at the surface, but it appears with some other relics of 
the old moorland vegetation on a part of Allsop Moor, near 
Newhaven. It may be that the curious sandy deposit which is 
found in various spots on that elevated tract may be there also, 
and may have helped to supply a congenial peaty soil for heathland 
plants. I hope to pay more attention to this point than I have done. 

Ligustnon ruh/are. Rocky limestone slopes of the Dove Valley, 
from 600 to 1000 ft. 

Gentiana AiimreUa. On limestone in Dovedale ; and also on 
grit elsewhere. — I have not seen G. campestris on this western side 
of Derbyshire. 

PoJemonium ccernleum. Eocky banks in several parts of the Dove 
Valley, although not in Dovedale proper. 

Yerbascwn niijrum, which a few years ago was plentiful at Alport, 
near Youlgrave, has quite disappeared for the last two seasons. 

Scrophularia Balbisii is singularly absent from the valley of the 
Dove and its immediate surroundings. I have noticed it in the 
Via Gellia, as did Mr, Baker, but all search for it nearer home has 
been in vain. A pale -flowered variety of S. nodosa in the Via 
Gellia with the usual form. 

Linaria rnhjaris is, so far as my observation goes, confined to 
the Staffordshire side of the Dove Valley, and to one spot only a 
mile or two above Dovedale proper. 

Mentha are not plentiful. M. sylvestris is to be seen in Dove- 
dale, but only in one spot, and in very small quantity. 

Calamintha Clinopodmm. Valley of the Dove, between Thorpe 
and Mappleton. 

Stachys amhuiua. Between Derby and Mackworth ; a form 
which comes rather nearer to 8. sylvcitica than does Mr. H. C. 
Watson's Surrey plant or Dr. Boswell's Orkney plant in that the 
leaves are more ovate, their serratures more convex-sided, and the 
flowers smaller and darker. — 8. Betonica. Meadows between 
Thorpe and Mappleton. 

Galeopsis versicolor. In plenty in a field near Youlgrave a few 
seasons ago. 

Myosotis palnstris, which so abounds in various parts of the 
valley of the Derbyshire Wye, is entirely absent from that of the 
Dove. — M. sylvatica. Dovedale and Fenny Bentley ; much more 
common, in fact, in this neighbourhood than M. arvcnsis, and 
flowering several weeks earlier than it. — M. repcns. I feel pretty 
sure that I gathered this in a wet place near Blackwall, Hulland, 
some years since, but I cannot find a record. 

The Syiiiphytwii, so very abundant a few seasons ago by the side 
of the stream between Grange Mill and the Lilies Inn, at the head 
of the Via Gellia, has now greatly diminished in quantity. Speci- 
mens of this plant have been sent to the Botanical Exchange Club 
by both Mr. C. Bailey and myself. In the Botanical Exchange 
Club Reports for 1877-8, p. 17, this plant is regarded by Dr. 
Boswell as probably 8. jtenyrinuvi liedeb. In the other station near 
Youlgrave (misprinted Yurlgrave) I saw but one patch of it.

Lysimachia nemomm. Scarce iu N. Derbyshire, and only seen 
by me sparingly in the upper part of the Dove Valley. 

l'oli/i/(inu'm JJifitortd. Fenny Bentley. 

Daji/inc Mezereum exists, although in very small quantity, on the 
Derbyshire side of the Dove Valley. 

Popuhis tremula would have been seen by Mr. Baker had 
time allowed him to explore the upper part of Dovedale. It grows 
about the rocks in which are the caverns called the Doveholes, but 
in small quantity. 

Salices are fewer in N. Derbyshire than even in N. Staffordshire. 
— S. vimmalis, alba, cincrea, and Caprca occur in the upper reaches 
of Dovedale. Near Lode Mill, and again farther down the stream 
are some small trees of S. Forln/ana (identified with very little doubt 
by the Kev. J. E. Leefe). The head-quarters, however, of this 
species are on the Staffordshire bank of the Dove, just below 
Lode Mill, where there are several old trees about 15 ft. high, 
and I suspect that the younger bushes have been derived from 
these through branches which have been torn off" by winds or 
floods having been carried down and lodged on the banks, there 
taking root and growing. In other cases I think they must have 
been planted as cuttings : all are the female plant, I find this 
to be one of the willows most frequently planted near houses 
and gardens hereabout, I suppose for the sake of a supply of 
twigs. — S. Janceolata Sm. A willow found in Miller's Dale is 
thus named by the Eev. J. E. Leefe. So far as can be decided 
without comparison of the catkins (for Mr. M. Kay's specimen is 
without them), this is exactly the same as the plant from Cambus- 
lang, Lanarkshire, distributed by the Botanical Exchange Club 
under the name of undulata. The Derbyshire plant was met with 
late in August, where it was flowering a second time, just as the 
Triandrcc, and more frequently S. hippophafffolia, will do. It is 
the pistillate plant (Has the staminate plant been yet found in 
Britain?), and has the appearance of being native on the river-bank. 

Taxus haccata. Plentiful on some of the cliffs of Dovedale. 

Of Potamogetons, P. crispus is the only species I have been able 
to find in the Dove. — P. nutans. In a pond near the Ashbourne 
and Buxton Eoad, four miles from Ashbourne. — i'. ziMcrafolim. 
In the Cromford Canal, and in Keservoirs at Cromford, where my 
attention was called to it last summer by Mr. C. Bailey. 

Orchids are less plentiful than might have been expected.— 
Orchis pijramidaUs. On the slopes of the Via Gellia. I have not 
met with it in Dovedale. - — 0. masciila and maculata are common. 

Gij)iniad('nia conopsca. In the Via Gellia, sometimes with white 
flowers. Although occurring plentifully in one of the Staffordshire 
valleys a few miles west of Dovedale, I have not seen it between 
that Staffordshire habitat and the Via Gellia, a distance of eight or 
nine miles.

occurs in some plenty on one part of the half-reclaimed Stafford- 
shire moorland in this parish. I have never yet met with li. bifolia 
in the rich vegetable soil of woods, which H. chlnrantha seems to 
affect ; H. bifolia seems to prefer somewhat heathy ground. 

Ophrys vmsci/em occurs very sparingly in Dovedale, but I have 
sought in vain for (>. apifera. 

Listera ovata. Dovedale, but scarce. 

Epijmctis latifolia. Brassington Eocks and Dovedale. The form 
which occurs in Dovedale is one which shows a strong preference 
for limestone, and is identical, or very nearly so, with the 
Herefordshire plant from Little Doward Hill, referred by Prof. 
Babington to E. oralis. This form agrees with the E. oralis of 
Settle and the Ormshead in general growth, in the somewhat 
sudden passage from leaves to bracts, in the bracts being mostly 
shorter than the flowers, and in the transversely oval outline of the 
label ; but it differs in the surface of the label being smooth, the 
basal "hunches" not being prolonged downward so as to occupy 
the centre of the label with an elevated rugose protuberance, bi;t 
confined to the constriction which separates the two portions of the 
lip. On account of this difference I have always ventured to doubt 
the identity of the Herefordshire "oval is" with the plant of York- 
shire and the Ormshead ; and now, after having again very 
carefully compared them, I can only say that I still think them 
different ; the differences are indeed but small, but much more 
tangible than any which separate the Herefordshire " oralis " (and 
the Dovedale plant also) from the forms by which it gradually 
passes into the larger and more general plant which Prof. Babington 
pointed out to me as his E. luedia, but which better answers to his 
description of E. latifolia. The character of the label of the true 
oralis is shown in the enlarged figure on the Eng. Bot. plate, and 
is confirmed by a careful pencil-sketch made from a fresh Settle 
specimen by the late Kev. G. E. Smith, and sent to me not very 
long before his death. A comparison of these with my own 
sketches made from the living Herefordshire plant makes the 
difference clear, and supports my belief that the Herefordshire and 
Derbyshire plants belong rather to E. latifolia or media than to E. 
oralis, but that they constitute a limestone form which, out of many, 
comes nearest to oralis. I have from time to time during many 
years carefully examined the forms of aggregate E. latifolia which 
I have met with either in the south-western or in the midland 
counties, but I have never been able to see that the forms existing 
in Nature were adequately recognised in books ; and I still venture 
to think that a more extended study of these plants would lead to the 
adoption of some more varietal forms than at present, and very 
probably also to some rearrangement. There are drawbacks to the 
study of the forms of Epijiactis in the facts that they are rarely 
found in any quantity so as to allow of the comparison of many 
individuals whilst fresh, and that, unless very unusual care be 
taken in the pressing, there is little to be made out about the 
flowers from dried specimens. It is best to detach one or two 
flowers, and spread out the label between slips of paper, so as to

exhibit its form. Mr. Baker tells me that he has met with a 
limestone Epipactis in the Lake district, which he at first thought 
might be oralis, but which he afterwards decided to be latifolia. It 
seems likely to be identical with the Herefordshire plant. 

Paris (juadrifolia. Dovedale, but scarce. 

Poh/(/()iiatum officmale. Dovedale. 

Allium 2irsinu)ii. Abundant in one part of Dovedale. — A. 
oleraceAim. I had the pleasure of meeting with tiais, last August, in 
the clefts of one of the Dovedale rocks, about 1100 ft. I think not 
previously recorded from the county. 

Scirjius setaceus. Dovedale. — S. sylvaticus. By the Dove, above 
Hartington. 

Carex muricata. Between Hartington and Beresford Dale. — 
C. vulpina. Between Sandy Brook and Eose Cottage, near Ash- 
bourne. — C. riparia. Near Bradbourne Mill. — C. paludosa. Banks 
of the Bradford, at Youlgrave. 

Avena puhescens is abundant in limestone pastures. — A. pratensis. 
Very much less common. 

The Ghjceria which is so abundant in the lower reaches of 
Dovedale is G. pediceUata. — There are two forms of (x. plicata ; 
one, which I suppose to be the typical plant of Fries, is glaucous, 
with blunt broad leaves, which are folded in vernation ; the other, 
a much taller plant, quite green, like G.Jluitans, and with narrow- 
pointed simply-folded leaves, and with a much larger panicle ; 
both of these, as well as G. pediceUata, were observed by Mr. C. 
Bailey and myself about the upper Eeservoirs of the Via Gellia. 
These forms seem to have received little notice from botanists, but 
their diiferences are obvious if a little attention is given to them. 
Of G. pediceUata the fruit seems invariably abortive, if not infested 
with ergot, to which it is peculiarly liable. I observe that Mr. 
Townsend in his original description gave no account of the cary- 
opsis, probably never having seen it. 

Festnca. There is in Dovedale and various other places a very 
glaucous form, which I presume to be that intended under the 
name of F. ovina, var. (jlauca, of the ' Student's Flora.' — F. elatior. 
Dovedale and elsewhere ; especially plentiful in the Via Gellia ; 
when in flower its divaricate panicle-branches make it conspicuous. 

The absence of Bromiis ercctus has always struck me as remark- 
able ; I see, however, that Mr. Painter records it from Miller's Dale. 

The Ferns of the district have grievously suffered from the 
ravages of the guides. — Ceterach officinarum, which, I am credibly 
informed, was formerly abundant on the rocks of Dovedale, is 
almost absolutely extinct. I have this day, after a careful search, 
succeeded in finding a single small plant (which I of course left 
undisturbed) in a place which had been mentioned to me, but 
I know not where I could find another on the Derbyshire side. 

Pob/podium U«hertianum is no longer to be found on the Derby- 
shire side of Dovedale. The extremely dry summers of 18G8-1870 
seem to have destroyed it ; the spot on which I am told that it grew 
i)lentifully is much exposed. I have seen it, but in very small 
quantity, on the Staffordshire side. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 203 

Aspidium aculeatum has been nearly eradicated. — A. angulare 
I have never yet met with in Derbyshire, though I have seen it on 
the New Red Sandstone in Staffordshire. 

Botrychium Limaria. I once met with this on one of the liills 
above Dovedale, at about 1200 ft. elevation. 

Pteris is absent from Dovedale, and I do not know a nearer 
station than Hartington Dale, some five miles off, where it is 
growing on limestone. It is very scarce on the North Staffordshire 
moors. 

I hope hereafter to follow up these Notes on North Derbyshire 
Botany by a list of the species which I noted down during the years 
I passed in the extreme south of the county.

Descriptions op New Species and Varieties. 

Alsodeia decora Trim. — Glabrous, the young twigs finely 
pilose ; leaves oblong-lanceolate, somewhat trapezoid, shortly 
acuminate, the apex very obtuse or emarginate, the upper half 
shallowly crenate-serrate ; petiole short, slender ; stipules subulate, 
early caducous ; flowers not seen ; fruit solitary, on slender 
peduncles from short scaly branchlets in axils of fallen leaves ; 
persistent sepals rigid, lanceolate, acute ; persistent petals strap- 
shaped, twice as long as sepals; capsule over ^ in. long, glabrous; 
seeds 3, mottled. 

Hab. Near Great Western Hill, Hewahette, Cent. Province 
1868. (C. P. 4006 in Herb. Perad.) 

Leaves 2-2^ in. long, rather stiff, veins reticulated, strongly 
marked on both surfaces. Petals ^ in. Fruit-stalks ^ in. long. 
Dr. Thwaites has called this A. ohuisata (in Hb. Perad.), a name 
too closely similar to A. obtusa Hassk. to be adopted. 

Vatica obscura Trim. — Leaves narrowly oblong-lanceolate, 
acuminate, obtuse ; lateral veins about 12 on either side ; venation 
prominent beneath ; flowers stalked, in short lax leafy panicjes in 
the leaf-axils ; branches of inflorescence densely scurfy or stellately 
pubescent. Calyx small, -r'o iu- ; segments oval-lanceolate, sub- 
acute ; petals i-f in. long, oblong strap-shaped, the base concave 
and stiff"; fruiting calyx (not fully matured) much enlarged, fully 
i in.; the segments equal, broadly oval, obtuse, 3-veiued ; ripe 
fruit not seen. 

Hab. Forests in the Eastern Province. Leaves 4-6 in. Ion" 
by i-1 in. broad, paler beneath, pellucid-pimctate with transmitted 
light ; petiole i-f in. long, slightly pubescent when young. 
Flowers rather large ; petals white, with a pink base; stamens 15: 
anthers broadly oblong, connective apiculate ; ovary conical

puberulous; style a little longer than calyx, with a capitate stigma. 

A poor specimen in immature fruit was sent me in 1882 by Mr. 
Vincent, with the vernacular name of " Tampale," and is referred 
to in his Report on the Ceylon Forests (par, 106, 147) as " Vatica 
sp.," and described as a fine timber-tree. I have since received 
good flowering specimens collected in June, 1884, by Capt. Walker, 
Forester, at Polukanawa in the same district ; and this gentleman 
is endeavouring to obtain also ripe fruit, which it is very desirable 
to examine. V. ohscura is apparently a near ally of V. ajjinis Thw., 
a tree of the S.W. of Ceylon, but ripe fruit may show them to be 
more distinct than now appears. The principal differences consist 
in the narroAver and thinner leaves with twice as many lateral veins, 
the less deeply divided calyx with more obtuse segments, and the 
larger flowers of V. uhscura. I was at first inclined to refer the 
latter, from descriptions only, to V. Umcea/ulia Bl. {Vatica Hoxh.), 
of East Bengal, but Mr. Thiselton Dyer, to whom I submitted a 
specimen, thinks it certainly not that plant. 

All these belong to Wight's Isan.vis, a good genus, but not 
requiring a new name, being the original Vatica of Linnfeus. V. 
cldnensis L., the type of the genus (figured in J. E. Smith's Ic. Ined. 
t. 36), is clearly the same as V. Uoxbun/hiana Bl.,* the common 
" Mendora" of Ceylon ; but I suppose this specific name may have 
to be regarded as a "nomen falsum," as the plant does not grow in 
China. In this genus the calyx-segments are all equally enlarged 
in fruit. Included also in Vatica by the authors of the ' Genera 
Plantarum' are other species to form a section, unfortunately termed 
Eu-vatica, in which two only of tlie calyx-segments are greatly 
enlarged ; on the principles followed for genera in this family, this 
should rather be considered as distinct; and as it seems to be 
Snna2)tcaj- of Griffith that name may be adopted. To it belongs 
Vateria {Stcmonoporus) scabrinscida Thw. Enum. p. 404 [Vatica 
A. DC), the fruit of which has been discovered more recently, and 
probably also F. disticha Thw. /. c, of which the fruit is still 
unknown. The fruiting- calyx of this genus is much like that of 
Hupea (in which, as "Sect. 2," A. DC. includes Sunaptea <jrandi- 
Jinra) ; but the segments are free and loose, not twisted and 
imbricated, as in Hopea {i. e., H. discolor and H.jucunda of Ceylon). 

Thorea Dyerii Thw. ms.- — Leaves (floral) 2^-S in. long, on 
petioles f-^ in., narrowly ovate-lanceolate, gradually tapering to 
the subacuminate obtuse apex ; lateral veins 12-14 on either side, 
connected by fine transverse parallel veiulets ; flowers numerous, 
sessile, small, rather closely placed, and secund along the upper 
side of the short divaricate branchlets of the large spreading axillary 
and terminal inflorescence ; buds small, bluntly conical, the whole 
densely covered with a fine grey pubescence of sessilely stellate 
hairs, mixed on the flowers with simple silky ones ; calyx-segments 

* In the 'Gen. Plantarum,' i., p. 192, " Vatica indica L." (F. chincmis being 
no doubt meant) is erroneously referred to Hopca grandiflora Wall. = Vatica,

broadly oval, subacute; petals oblong-oval, slightly concave, not 
twisted; stamens very small, about 60; filaments dilated at base, 
and prolonged beyond tlic adnate anther-cells into a strongly-ciliated 
apiculus about half as long as the anther ; ovary oblong-pyramidal, 
pubescent; style very short; fruit not known. 

Hab. "South of the Island" (C. P. 4010 in Hb. Perad.). 
Leaves smooth on both sides or with a few stellate hairs beneath; 
veins not prominent. Corolla apparently red. 

I regret that the material for this species is so scanty, consisting 
only of inflorescence in mature bud just about to expand ; we have 
no fruit, and no large foliage. There can, however, be little doubt 
that it is allied to S. ohlon(jifolia Thw., from which it differs in the 
shape of the leaves, in the petals, and in the number and form of 
the stamens. 

I have not met with this species myself, nor do I know precisely 
where the specimens in the Herbarium were collected ; but I am 
glad to be the medium of publishing Dr. Thwaites' dedication of it 
to my friend Mr. Thiselton Dyer, the monographer of the Indian 
DipterocarpecB. 

Shorea brevipetiolaris Thw. ms. — Leaves ovate, 4 or 5 in. 
long, cordate or subcordate at base, more or less caudate-acuminate 
and obtuse at apex, subcoriaceous ; lateral veins about 7 on either 
side, curved, prominent beneath ; petioles thick, curved, about \ in. 
long ; when young, usually very densely covered with short coarse 
shaggy hair, which is also scattered over the young twigs ; panicles 
about as long as leaves, several (2-5) coming off from one axil ; 
racliis with few short spreading branches, minutely pubescent ; 
bracts or very quickly caducous ; buds subglobose, blunt ; sepals 
ovate, obtuse, glabrous ; petals not expanded in the specimens ; 
stamens 15; filaments much dilated below; apiculus as long as 
anther ; ovary globose, cells with 2 ovules in each ; style subulate, 
as long as ovary ; fruit not known. 

Hab. Summit of Doluwe Kande, a few miles north of Kurune- 
gala, N. W. Province, Dec, 1883. (Also C. P. 4008 (no locahty) 
in Hb. Perad. (leaves only).). 

A small tree ; leaves quite glabrous, the petioles also becoming 
so when old, and then thickened, rugose, and chocolate-brown in 
colour. My specimens are in bud only ; the flowers seem to be 
white or pinkish. 

There is a young tree of this species in the Botanic Gardens, 
but it has not yet flowered; the leaf-specimens (C. P. 4008) in the 
Herbarium without locality may be from this tree. In the absence 
of fruit some doubt may be felt as to the genus ; if a Shorea, as is 
most probable, it is not very closely allied to the other Ceylon species. 

Shorea stipulari^ Thw., var. minor Thw. ms. — Leaves smaller 
than the type, about 3 in. long, the apex strongly twisted, very 
finely but densely pubescent beneath ; stipules less persistent, more 
acute and narrower, densely pubescent, as also the young growths. 

Hab. Morowe Korle, Southern Province, July, 1868, with fruit. 
(C. P. 3987 (in part-), and C. P. 4024, in Hb. Perad.). In the

20G NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

type the leaves often reach 9-12 in. in length on petioles of 3-4 in., 
which are much thickened and fleshy. The flowers of this curious 
species are still unknown, but there are young trees in the Gardens 
which will, it may be hoped, in time supply them. I collected in 
the Morowe Korle another variety with the leaves almost rotund in 
outline, with a very marked short acumination. 

This species is frequently the subject of a curious malformation. 
Hard rounded pale green bodies are produced in the leaf-axils, 
consisting of half-fused masses of very short crowded coral-like 
abortive branchlets, the lobulated ends of which form the surface of 
the mass, which is covered with a viscous exudation. These are 
probably abortive and metamorphosed inflorescences. 

Doona oblonga Thw. ms. — Leaves 3^-4^ in. long by 1^-1^ in. 
broad, narrowly oval-oblong, rounded at base, gradually caudate- 
acuminate ; margin recurved; lateral veins 8-11 on each side, 
parallel, curved, distinct; flowers not seen; fruiting calyx-segments 
not more than 1^ in. long, oval-oblong, faintly veined. 

C. P. 3986 in Herb. Perad. (no locality). 

This is very near D. congestiflora Thw., but differs in the leaves 
and in the short broad calyx-segments of the fruit. 

Vateria nervosa Thw. ms. — Leaves lanceolate-oblong, 
81-5 in. long, caudate -acuminate at apex, wedge-shaped at base, 
pale beneath, with few, faint, arched, lateral veins connected by 
reticulation ; the base somewhat 3-nerved ; flowers and fruit 
unknown. 

Hab. Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, Sept., 1865. (C. P. 3815 in 
Herb. Perad.). 

The material is scarcely sufficient, but Dr. Thwaites seems to 
have been satisfied that he had here a new species. It apparently 
comes nearest to V. [Stemonoporus) nitida Thw., var. lancifolia 
Dyer. Thwaites' genus Stemonopoms is a very distinct group 
confined to Ceylon, and perhaps on a general revision of the order 
may make good its claim to re -separation from Vateria. 

Triumfetta conspicua Trim. — Semi-shrubby ; stems 3-5 ft. 
high, cylindrical, much branched, wiry, rough with stellate hairs ; 
branches elongated, erect, ascending; leaves suborbicular, rather 
broader than long, with a caudate base and acute apex, irregularly 
crenate-dentate and finely 3-lobed, quite glabrous above, pale and 
with a pubescence of stellate hairs beneath ; inflorescence much 
elongated and quite leafless, with rather distant irregular paniculate 
clusters of stalked crowded flowers ; sepals with a rather long 
curved spreading apiculus, densely stellate-pubescent, reddish ; 
petals quite as long as the sepals, broad-spathulate, with long 
claws, spreading, ciliate at base, brilhant yellow ; stamens 20 ; 
fruit globose or nearly so, f in. long or more with the spines, 
rather densely covered with short stiff simple yellowish hairs and 
with hard spreading hooked red spines, the lower parts of which 
are set with similar hairs. 

Hab. Li vast abundance on waste ground about Tissa-maha- 
rama. Southern Province, Dec, 1882 ; the quantity of its compara- 
tively large flowers and their brilliant colour making it quite a

showy plant. The whole covering of the plant consists of stellate 
hairs. 

1 am nnable to fit this into any of tlie descriptions in the Indian 
books. I have met with it nowhere else in Ceylon than the above 
spot. From T. rhomhoidea Jacq. it differs in the character of the 
hair, in its rotmidate leaves glabrous above, quite naked inflorescence, 
and larger flowers nearly \ in. wide. The flower-buds are elongated 
and cylindrical, hoary, dilated at the apex, where they are covered 
by a star formed of the 5 spreading sepal-appendages. T. rhomhoidea 
is of course an abundant weed in Ceylon, and varies somewhat in 
amount, but not in character, of pubescence, which is never stellate. 

Eugenia (Eu-eugenia) phillyreoides Trim. — Shrubby, much 
branched ; leaves numerous, crowded, small, stiff and rigid, linear- 
lanceolate, tapering at both ends, especially into the short petiole, 
subobtuse ; midrib prominent ; lateral veins obscure; margin revo- 
lute, glabrous (the youngest only with scanty appressed silky white 
hairs), dark green, paler beneath ; flowers (not seen) always axillary, 
solitary, stalked; fruit the size of a sloe, depresso-globose, with a 
flat top, crowned by the short conical style, wide disk, and 4 enlarged 
persistent spreading rather unequal calyx- segments, 2 obtuse and 
2 acute; seeds 2 or 3, plano-convex. 

Hab. Summit of Kalupahane Kande, Lagalla, East Matale, 
May, 1884. A small dense twiggy bush with numerous erect 
branchlets. Leaves rarely exceeding 1 in. with the petioles. Fruit 
red, pubescent when young, afterwards smooth, on peduncles 
i-f in. long. 

This does not nearly approach any other Ceylon species ; from 
the descriptions given, E. Jossinia Duth. [Jossinia indica Wight), of 
South India, must, however, be nearly allied, though quite distinct. 

Eugenia (Eu-eugenia) Haeckeliana Trim. — Branches cylin- 
drical, the young shoots floccose-woolly, with fulvous tomentum ; 
leaves broadly oblong-ovate, more or less cordate at base, subacute, 
thick, the margin somewhat undulated ; midrib thick and prominent 
beneath, the lateral veins (about 12 on either side) conspicuous and 
united by strong arches at some distance £fom the margin, glabrous 
and bright green when mature, densely covered when young with 
close yellow tomentum ; petiole stout, very short ; flowers large, 
solitary, on short stout peduncles coming from the axils of opposite 
leafy bracts on the young shoots below or alternating with the 
ordinary leaves ; bracts a little longer than the peduncles ; calyx- 
tube with two smaller bracts immediately below it, all fulvous- 
woolly ; calyx-lobes 4, broad, acute, slightly recurved in flowering, 
afterwards erect ; petals rather longer than the calyx-lobes ; disk 
broad, square, densely woolly ; fruit (not ripe) spherical, crowned 
by the calyx-lobes. 

Hab. Among rocks by the sea-shore at Weligana, South 
Province, Dec, 1882. A small tree with reddish bark. Leaves 
4-6 in. long, with a tendency to be stiffly bent conduplicatcly on 
the arched midrib. Flowers 1^ in. wide; petals white, with a 
pink tinge. 

This is readily distinguished by the flowers from Pl./idva Thw.,

which much resembles it in foliage. The large bracts beneath the 
calyx are similar to those of the South Indian E. J^occosa Bedd., 
near which the present species will stand. I have named it in 
remembrance of my friend Prof. Ernst Haeckel, of Jena, who spent 
six weeks in researches in marine zoology at the i)icturesque sea- 
side fishing- village where I collected it. 

Sonerila Guneratnei Trim. — Perfectly glabrous ; stems 
numerous, erect, 12-15 in. high, slender, subquadrangular or 
nearly cylindrical, fiexuose, smooth and shining, bare below, 
irregularly branched above, branches long ascending or droopmg ; 
leaves apparently whorled, 4 at each node, but in reality in two 
closely inserted decussate pairs, subsessile, strap-shaped, tapering 
below, obtuse at apex, entire below, but with 3 or 4 sharp teeth on 
either side in upper third, thick, with a strong midrib, deepened 
above, very prominent beneath ; flowers few, in short terminal 
unilateral racemes (often reduced to solitary flowers) ; pedicels 
short, straight, deflexed in bud ; calyx-tube 6-ribbed, the upper 
one-third or more free ; teeth fleshy, deciduous ; petals spreading 
horizontally ; stamens as long as petals, all bent upward ; anthers 
long, tapering to slightly curved elongated points ; style curved 
like the anthers ; roof of ovary formed of three erect fleshy processes 
together forming a conical surrounding the base of the style ; 
capsule erect and little longer the stalk into which it tapers, 
cylindrical, truncate, enclosed in strongly 6-ribbed calyx-tube ; 
seeds numerous, muriculate, orange-brown. 

Hab. Near Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, first collected in August, 
1868. (C. P. 4012 in Hb. Perad.). 

A small straggling semi-shrubby perennial, the stems vinous- 
red, slightly thickened at the nodes. Leaves ^-f in. long by ^ in. 
broad, the basal portion erect, then bent and spreading. Flowers 
coming in bloom singly in each raceme ; petals f in. long, bright 
deep pink, with a mauve tinge ; anthers bright sulphur-yellow. 

The very narrow leaves, in fours, give this a very diflerent aspect 
from all its Ceylon congeners, and appear to distinguish it from all 
other species. S. linearis Hk. f., from Moulmein, has apparently 
even narrower leaves, and is evidently nearly allied. The specific 
name commemorates its discoverer, Don Leman de Silva Guneratue, 
Mohandiram, the native plant-collector to the Botanical Gardens, 
Peradeniya, which post he has held for many years, and under 
successive Superintendents and Directors. He was the constant 
cumpanion of my predecessors Gardner and Thwaites (as of myself) 
in their excursions, and the former died in his arms in 1849. He 
possesses a wide knowledge of the Singhalese Flora, and it is 
perhaps not too much to say that nearly the whole of the species 
described by the two botanists mentioned passed through his hands 
as collector ; Dr. Thwaites acknowledges his intelligent co-operation 
in the preface to tlie ' Enumeratio.' 

Hedyotis rhinophylla Thw. ms. — Glabrous, the young shoots 
finely grey-puberulous ; branches subcylindrical ; leaves scarcely 
stalked, but much tapering to tbe base and apex, narrowly lanceo- 
late-caudate, pale green, whitish beneath; midrib very promhient

beneath ; lateral veins very oblique, obscure ; stipular sheath lax, 
^ in. long, the mouth fringed when young with a few stout unequal 
deciduous processes, when old truncate ; Howers in terminal loose 
pyramidal paniculate cymes, on slender pedicels rather longer than 
the calyx ; calyx-limb glabrous, campanulate, veiny, with shallow 
broad-triangular teeth ; capsule small, not protruded beyond the 
enlarged calyx. 

Hab. Wattekelle Hill, Kallebokka District, Central Province, 
Sept., 1868. (C. P. 3984 in Hb. Perad.). 

Apparently a small shrub with ascending slender whitish 
branches. Leaves 2-3 in. long, quite glabrous. Flowers medium- 
size of the genus, white ; corolla-lobes puberulous within. Seeds 
not seen. 

This is a distinct species of the small group allied to the very 
variable H.. Lesscrtiana, all of which are found only in Ceylon. 11. 
LawsonicB, to which it also bears a superficial resemblance, differs 
completely in the capsule and stipule.

SUPPLE MENTAKY LIST OF PHILIPPINE PLANTS. 
By B. a. Eolfe, A.L.S. 

In the recently published third or folio edition of Blanco's 
'Flora de Filipinas ' a "Novissima Appendix" is given, the object 
of which is to include all that is known of the Flora of the Islands 
up to the date of publication. In this Appendix the widely scattered 
references have been carefully brought together, and, so far as 
plants actually known from the Philippines are concerned, it is a 
great convenience to have them collected together in this way. In 
one respect, however (as I have pointed out in my paper in the 
'Journal of the Linnean Society,' xxi., p. 288), the Appendix is 
especially disappointing. It is this — that in several orders where 
very little has been published respecting Philippine plants, the 
authors identify nearly all their plants with descriptions of species 
from India or the Malay Archipelago, with the result that large 
numbers are wrongly identified, and the endemic element is almost 
entirely ignored. This fact especially shows up the difficulty of 
satisfactorily working out a Flora without the material having been 
carefully compared with existing types. The fact is a most un- 
fortunate one, and can only be remedied gradually as the materials 
come to hand. 

The following list consists of plants which have been omitted in 
the above-named Appendix, and under the circumstances it may 
perhaps be worth while to publish it in the present form : —

PELOEIA IN HABENARTA BIFOLIA Br. 
By H. N. Kidley, M.A., F.L.S. 

Mr. BouLftER has lately put into my hands a curious monstrosity 
of Hahenaria hi folia Br. , in which the lip is exactly similar in form, tex- 
ture, and size to the petals, and there is no trace of any spur. This 
occurs in every flower on the spike. Although I am not acquainted 
with any similar instance in this genus, it is not unknown in other 
genera, such as Cattleya and Lcdia. There is a figure of a similar 
monstrosity in Cattleya pumila in the ' Gardeners' Chronicle,' 
May 9th, 1885, p. 597, and it is most probable that Paxtonia rosea 
is a peloriated form of a SpatJiioylottis. But there is a point of 
greater interest in some of the flowers of the Hahenaria. From the 
base of the column arise two white foliaceous bodies, ovate, oblong, 
and obtuse, curved up in front of the column. These are doubtless 
the stigmatic lobes, which are never normally developed into pro- 
cesses in any of our British Orchids ; but in many of the Habenarias 
of tropical countries, such as H. macroceras of S. America and West 
Indies, they take the form — as in this monstrosity — of flattened 
foliaceous organs, or of terete arms of greater or shorter length. 
This malformation may thus be set down as an uistance of reversion 
to an older type. 

The genus Platanthera being now reduced by Mr. Bentham to a 
section of Hahenaria, from which genus, indeed, it is impossible to 
separate it by any definite characters, it becomes necessary to alter 
the generic name Platanthera. It is customary in such cases to 
preserve the old specific name where possible ; and with respect to 



SHOKT NOTES. 219 

our British species tliis is satisfactory in every case but one, viz., 
PlatiinthL'ra chlorantha Curt. [Orclm bifolia Richard), O. virescens 
Gaud., O. ochroleuca Ten., P. Wankelii Rchb. f., P. montana Rchb. f., 
Habenaria chlorantha Babington. Unfortunately the last stands for 
a Mauritius plant with really green flowers, described by Sprengel 
(Syst. Veget. iii. p. 691), so a new name must be imposed; and I 
propose that of Habenaria chloroleuca for the plant, which describes 
the actual colour of the flowers more satisfactorily than clilurantha. 
The remaining British plants now included in the genera are — 
H. bifolia R. Br. = P. solstitiaiis Bnngh. ; H. conopsea = Gijvina- 
denia conopsea R. Br. ; H. albida R. Br. = Gymnadenia albida Rich, 
Peristylus albidus Lindl., Leucorchis albidics Mey. ; H. viridis R. Br. 
= Cceloglossum viride Hartm., Platanthera viridis Ldl. ; H. intacta 
Benth. = TincBa cylindracea Biv., Satyrium maculatum Desf., Orchis 
intacta Lk., Aceras densijiora Boiss., A, intacta Rchb. f., Neotinea 
intacta Rchb. f., Himantoglossum secundiflorum Rchb. f. 



SHORT NOTES. 

Note on the Algo-Lichen Hypothesis. — In addition to the 
various direct and indirect arguments which have been adduced 
against this theory, another, and in some respects a still more 
convincing proof, has quite recently been brought under notice by 
Dr. Nylander in 'Flora' (1885, p. 313). In his observations upon 
Gyalecta Lamprospora Nyl., a new species from North America 
collected by Mr. Willey, of which a full diagnosis is given, he 
writes : — •" Each gonidium of this Gyalecta is distinctly seen to 
emit from its thickish cellular wall (as do also the young gonidia) 
a firm medullary filament, and often two such filaments, charac- 
teristic of the nature of lichens. It is most manifest that these 
licheno-hyphae are productions, and indeed continuations, of the 
cellular wall of the gonidium itself." In the species under notice 
it may be mentioned that the thallus is not corticated, and that the 
gonidia are most frequently chroolepoidly seriated and moderate. 
Now this very important discovery of the veteran and distinguished 
Hellenist is, beyond all question, sufficient of itself at once to dis- 
prove Schwendenerism in all its phases. For if the gonidia thus 
send forth filaments in the manner stated, then the gonidia clearly 
cannot be algals ; and if licheno-hyphae are thus produced by the 
gonidia, then these hyphae as clearly cannot be parasitic fungal 
mycelia. On these grounds alone (apart from other considerations) 
this plausible hypothesis necessarily collapses, and "symbiosis" is 
seen to be but a mere fable. — J. M. Crombie. 

ScHCENUs FERRUGiNEUs L. IN Britain. — As it is Hot imposslble 
that, if looked for, the plant may be found elsewhere in Britain, it 
seems desirable to lose no time in recording the occurrence of 
Schamus ferruijineus L. in Perthshire. The specimens before me 
were collected beside Loch Tummel, in July last, by my friend Mr. 
Brebuer ; but it is only now that, in beginning an examination of

SHOKT NOTES. 



the Perthshire Cifperacea,, I have determined the species. From its 
European distribution — from Scandinavia southwards to S.E. 
France, and eastwards to Thrace and Middle Eussia — S.ferruf/ineus 
was a species not unlikely to occur in Britain. Though bearing a 
certain resemblance to S. nic/ricans, it is abundantly distinct from 
that species. As my specimens are not in fruit, I reserve a full 
description till I have an opportunity of visiting the locality where 
Mr. Brebner found the plant. In the meantime, however, I may 
indicate some of the points of difference between it and S. nu/Hcans. 
In the first place S.ferrugineus is more slender in all its parts than 
S. nu/ricaiis, and as the spike has generally only two spikelets, and 
often only one, it is narrow and oblong rather than obovoid. In 
the second place the lower bract is only about as long as, or a little 
shorter than, the sjiike, and its subulate point is erect instead of 
oblique. In the third place the dorsal keel of the glumes is either 
quite smooth or, more rarely, very slightly rough. The Loch 
Tummel specimens, which much resemble German and Swiss speci- 
mens in my herbarium, are from seven to eleven inches long, and 
have very short leaves. — F. Buchanan White. 

Ferns new to N. S. Wales. — In a collection of ferns made 
recently near Illawarra, S. Australia, which Mr. Baker has kindly 
named for me, are three species — Xephrodium hispklum Hook., 
Hymenophyllum imdtifidum Sw., and H. varium Br., not hitherto 
recorded for the colony. — Joseph Eedfobd. 

New Anglesey Station for Chamagrostis minima. — I have just 
received specimens of this grass, collected this month, from a 
station in Anglesey not previously reported, namely, at Khos-neigir, 
m the neighbourhood of Cymmeran Bay. The only other Anglesey 
station for this plant is on the western side of Llyn Coron, a small 
lake about half a mile long, close to the Bodorgon station, on the 
Chester and Holyhead Eailway. The new locality for this rare 
British grass is about five miles in a north-westerly direction fi-om 
Llyn Coron, and for its discovery we are indebted to Mrs. John 
Plant, the wife of the Curator of the Peel Park Museum, Salford. — 
Charles Bailey. 

Bedfordshire Plants. — In the excellent list of Bedfordshire 
plants given by Mr. James Saunders in this Journal for 1883, 
Papaver hi/bridiwi. L. finds no place. It has grown in the chalky 
corn and clover fields, close to the base of the hills, by the downs 
to the west of Dunstable, and has grown there for many years. 
Abbot speaks of the plant as common in Bedfordshire. Papaver 
Ar(jemone L. grows with it, and is the more abundant of the two. 
CepJiahmthera grandifiora Bab., stated to be rare by Abbot and 
Mr. Saunders, grows in the northern section of the long plantation 
of beeches, firs, and larches bordering the Eoman Eoad on the west 
of Dunstable. This locality is not given by either of the authors 
mentioned. — W. Gr. Smith. 

Crepis taraxacifolia in Middlesex. — Early in June I gathered 
Crepis taraxacifolia in several places between Hampton Court and

Kingston Bridge. It is especially abundant opposite the Water- 
works. This plant does not appear to have been met with hitherto 
in Middlesex. — John Benbow. 

Carex paradoxa Willd. in Cambridgeshire. — This interesting 
addition to the flora of Co. 29 grows in profusion in Wicken Fen. 
It is somewhat remarkable that neither it nor any allied form seems 
to have been recorded from this well-worked locality ; and the fact 
of its being spread over a considerable tract of the fen may stimu- 
late botanists to re-examine other districts of which the flora seems 
to be thoroughly known. — Alfred Fryer.

The appearance of this long-expected book will be highly 
welcome to every lover of plants. So classical a work requires no 
recommendation to a botanical public ; but it is worthy of perusal 
by every natural scientist, although he may have no intention of 
making a special study of the Hieracia. 

The mass of matter in the book is enormous ; in the course of 
more than twenty years' labour the authors acquired a knowledge 
of such an immense number of forms distinct and constant, of every 
gradation, that in order to prevent its assuming colossal proportions 
they were compelled to discard a certain number : nevertheless 
the number of distinct species amounts to 164 ; to most of them a 
larger or smaller number of subspecies, varieties, and subvarieties 
are attached, so that the grand total of described forms — "kindreds," 
as the author calls them — is 2000. To have examined this vast 
accumulation of material, to have carefully sifted and arranged it, 
and at last described it all in the clearest manner, so that everyone 
who does not fight shy of serious study may have at hand a sure 
and safe guide into the region of these forms, is the chief merit of 
this mighty work — a true monument of German scientific industry 
at which no one will withhold his astonishment who knows what 
labour of the kind really signifies. 

The arrangement of the systematic portion is as follows : — The 
subgenus ViluseUa is in the first instance divided into acmdia and 
ccndigera ; next the acaidia are subdivided into two, and the cauligera 
into seven sections ; in each of these sections are the chief or typical 
species as characteristics ; then follow the intermediates and 
hybrids — those first which are within the section, next those con- 
nected with the preceding one. The subspecies of the polymorphic

kinds are then for perspicuity's sake collected together into groups 
(ffreges). A systematic conspectus and a determining table at the 
end of the book serve to facilitate the survey and the study of it : 
a separate section determines the characters of the dried specimens 
supplied from various collectors ; the most considerable collection 
is that of Peter himself, consisting of 300 in number. 

Thus far we have been occupied with the systematic divisions 
only, of value to the botanist especially ; the other divisions are 
more generally interesting. First of all the morphology of the 
various groups is treated of, their innovation, relations, and certain 
biological characteristics indicated ; then the various points dis- 
cussed bearing upon their behaviour under cultivation, those which 
are constant distinguished from those which are variable, and so 
forth. In the section headed "The species and its component 
parts" it is shown that the kindred forms are of unequal systematic 
value, and that the species consists partly of individual kindred 
forms and partly of groups of them ; and an attempt is made to 
explain in graphic demonstrations by means of divers examples the 
phytogenetic origin of the kindred forms through variation and 
divergence, and the influence exercised by the dying-out of them. 
With regard to the systematic treatment of the subject, it is 
affirmed that not all the kindred forms connected with each other 
by intermediate links are to be considered as constituting a species, 
because in that case the first and the last members of the series 
would be less related to one another than to many others not con- 
nected by kindred ties in cases where an hiatus occurs from 
accidental circumstances, viz., extinction. 

The manifold relations of the series one to another are repre- 
sented by several graphic illustrations. Further, an attempt has 
been made to settle the manner in which the individual characters 
have philogenetically developed themselves ; which of them are of 
recent, which of earlier origin, thus indicating a pedigree, as it were, 
of the Piloselloids. The multiplication of forms through hybrids is 
particularly treated of ; and it is pointed out that in this way no 
new phenomena are produced, but only new combinations of 
characters already existent ; and that the kindred form conditions 
are scarcely altered, because of their rare occurrence. For the 
rest, the hybrids in the work before us are considered as inter- 
mediate forms, and designated individually by name. The chapter 
on geographical distribution will be read with especial interest, for 
it is not confined to the Piloselloids, but gives us a sketch of the 
origin of the Central European Flora in general. Particular 
sections are devoted to the means for working at monographs, 
literature, collections, travels, cultivation, method of work, and an 
account of nomenclature. As the views of systematists with regard 
to the systematic value of the kindred forms distinguished by the 
authors may vacillate, a non-recurrent name has very properly been 
given to every subspecies and important variety. 

Of course it is not every systematist who will coincide with the 
ideas of species entertained by the authors. If the views of the 
authors that the gaps between existhig species arc to be explained

by tlie extinction or dying-out of the intermediate forms — and 
therefore by an accidental occurrence — be correct, then of course 
there would be nothing to object to in their proceedings as regards 
the exclusion of intermediate forms from a series of graduated 
transitions between two species, which would not then be sharply 
defined on either side ; for if the intermediate forms of the species 
now isolated had not died out, they would have to be included with 
the others in the same girdle ; and if, for example, all the forms 
which have ever originated in the genus Hieracium were still in 
existence, the distinction of species generally would be nothing 
more than an arbitrary cutting-up of the network of forms into 
approximately equal-sized portions. At least the views of the 
authors tend to this conclusion ; for they see in those minute 
variations, as they occur so multifariously in the Hieracia especially, 
the beginnings of species-formation, and believe that these have 
always commenced with small steps of the kind, and that existent 
gaps in the series are explicable simply by the dying-out process. 

We are well aware that these views — also entertained by Darwin 
— are prevalent among the majority of enquirers ; nevertheless we 
would remind them that they are, after all, mere speculations to 
which facts cannot always be tacked on without force. Experience 
indicates rather that species-formation is not always consequent 
upon small gradations, but that at all times and perhaps in certain 
seasons more rapid transformations have taken place ; so that we 
might even, with 0. Heer, speak of a species mctutnorphosis. In 
this light the gaps between the isolated species would acquire a 
higher significance, and one could no longer consider these frag- 
ments of a closely woven circle of forms originating in very small 
steps of variation as their equivalents in value. Want of sjiace un- 
fortunately prevents us from going deeper into these matters, besides 
which such purely theoretical notions have no bearing upon the 
practical value of the book under consideration. As regards the 
form of it, it may seem rather strange that Latin, sometimes by 
itself and sometimes together with German, is used for the diagnoses 
of the species and of the groups, while for the subspecies and 
varieties only German is employed. We think the adoption of one 
language would have been more appropriate. The book is admirably 
got up.

A MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS fiRTHYLLIS. 

By J. G. Baker, F.R.S. 

(Plates 259, 260.) 

The Massonian drawings of GethilUs, which I have just had the 
pleasure of studying at the British Museum, add very materially to 
our knowledge of the genus. So far as I am personally concerned 
their discovery at this present juncture is most timely and satis- 
factory, as I have been busily engaged this winter in working out 
the Amaryllidacefe for my colleague Mr. Thiselton Dyer's con- 
tinuation of Harvey and Sonder's ' Flora Capensis.' The genus is 
very poorly represented in the London herbaria, and but little 
better in that of Thuuberg, of which, through the kindness of the 
authorities of the Museum at Upsala, I had the loan some time 
ago. The flowers are very fugitive, and, as they appear at a 
different time of year from the leaves, it is a task of much doubt and 
difficulty to sort out properly the dried specimens. As this series 
of drawings by Masson contains full sketches of seven out of nine 
species, two of them entirely unknown before and two others 
described from the leaves alone, it advances our knowledge of the 
genus very considerably.

BOTANICAL NOTES ALONG THE RIVERS NORE, 
BLACKWATER, &c. 

By Henry Chichester Hart. 

The River Nore rises on the northern flanks of the Devil's-bit 
range of mountains in the north-east of Tipperary. Flowing 
north of east to near the middle of the Queen's County, it then 
turns south and makes its way through the County Kilkenny to 
meet the Barrow near New Ross. The union of the two rivers 
forms the northern arm of the Waterford Estuary. 

On the 5th July, 1884, my friend and I left Templemore, and 
came on the Nore at the base of the hills in which it takes its 
source. For the first few miles no plant of rarity was gathered. 
Bee Orchis was in flower in two or three places, and several gay 
species decorated the hedges and river banks of this rather un- 
interesting country. These were chiefly Hijpericum Androstpinum, 
Viburnum Opulus, Eupatorium cannahinum, and Orchis pyramidalis. 
Elder and twayblade [Sambiicics nigra, Listera ovata), are also 
abundant species. Juncus glaucus not infrequent. 

The river here flows over an ancient oak-forest, its bed being 
full of contorted arms, stems, and roots, in situ ; these lie beneath 
thick beds of turf, through which the water has cut its channel. 
Ere long the turf disappears, and we come on rich soil lying on 
rounded glacial gravel deposit, on which the river-bed now lies. 
Great beds of Fotamogeton natans usurp the stream, and labourers 
with scythes are at work mowing the pond-weed beneath the 
water. For a considerable space they have to do this annually. 
The fall of the river is so slight that any impediment to the stream 
produces stoppages and a flood. 

Near Borris-in-Ossory,.:I^-ia7-^ia hispida, Thrincia hirta, Tragopogon 
pratensis are common in meadows by the stream. Salix pevtandra, 
a questionable native, is not infrequent, and a little farther very 
large moonwort, Botrgchum Lunaria, nearly a foot in height, with 
Lgsimachia rulgaris, were noted. On our first night we obtained 
beds at Mountrath. Below Mountrath (Enanthe Fhellandrium 
sparingly, and the rare Nasturtium sylvestre, were the most

interesting species. Bullfinches and goldfinches were not uncom- 
mon, and some timber by the river- banks rendered the scenery 
more pleasing, h'uonipmts europunis and Origannin ruhjarr. occurred, 
while wild roses, especially 11. arvensis, were abundantly in blossom. 
JiDictis (jlaucus has been our constant companion ; so also are 
Poh/i/onum ampldbinm and Sclrpus lacustris. Near Abbeyleix, I first 
noticed here a rather large sedge, Carex vesicaria; and in the 
Abbeyleix Woods Campanula Trachelium was obtained at the river's 
brink. Below Abbeyleix Equisetuin hycmale, Gyiimadenia conojisea, 
Quercits sessi/ijiora, and Carex paludusa occurred. Nearer to Durrow 
Thalictruvi fiavum, characteristic of the larger rivers in the inland 
counties of south-eastern Ireland, first ajjpeared. At Durrow we 
passed a night. The accommodation in these little towns cannot 
be expected much of, but the people usually take pleasure in doing 
their best, which makes up for many shortcomings. 

From Durrow we rejoined the Nore by the banks of a tributary, 
the Erkina. In it were seen the (Knanthe already mentioned, 
Ranunculus Lingua, Sium angustifolmvi, and Carex vesicaria. In 
thickets alongside of it, on the right bank near the junction, 
ULercurialis peremiin''- was found in the greatest abmidance for some 
distance. This is a very rare plant in Ireland, only occurring in 
about half a dozen localities, chiefly in the north, of which 
Parsonstown is the nearest. Along here occurred also Campanula 
Trachelium (sparingly), Orchis rnoriu, Euonymus eurupcBus, Scutellaria 
galericulata, Lgsimachia vulgaris, Gymnadenia conopsea, Nasturtixmi 
(Armoracia) amphibium, and Carex paludosa. These were noticed 
in the order given along the right bank of the river to Ballyragget, 
where we have entered the County Kilkenny. The river is pretty, 
diversified with wooded banks. At Ballyragget Matricaria Chamo- 
milla was found in a waste-heap by a mill-race ; it is an alien, and 
appears very rarely. I have never gathered it in Ireland except 
once at Howth and once in Wicklow, both times in waste ground. 
Malvu moschata, one of our prettiest wild flowers, was gathered. 
At Ballyragget we crossed to the left bank. About four miles down 
Nasturtium sylvestre again occurred. Yellow water-lily Avas frequent, 
the white hardly being met with. About two miles above Kilkenny, 
on the left bank, is a large patch of a naturalised Aster, which 
Mr. Baker believes is an American species, A. Icevis. Its occurrence, 
with all the outward appearance of a native, for it is far from a 
garden at present existing, or pleasure ground, is very interesting, 
I found it again in still more unsuspicious circumstances, and 
farther from a road below Woodstock on the other side ; and I 
have seen the same Aster since, apparently established, by a 
stream near Biuidoran, in Donegal, and in a garden at Glengarrifl', 
in Cork, In none of these places had it any sympton of a flower, 
up to the end of August at Bundoran. A little below the Aster, 
and from that to the town of Kilkenny, in wet meadows close to 
the river, Culchicum autumnale was met with abundantly, and now 

* I have recently received specimens of this phmt from Glassloui,'h, Co. 
Monaghan, where Miss i'oung finds it iu abundance.

in fruit. The entrance to Kilkenny is very fine by the river, the 
Castle of the Ormondes being a most imposing structure. An 
excellent hotel afforded us a good night's rest. 

On the following morning (Tuesday, July 8th) we left Kilkenny. 
Senebicni (Jidi/nia was noticed about the town. (J. sanguinea, in 
the large shrubbery form, is naturalised below the town in several 
places. Thalictntvi Jiavum, Nastiutium palnstre, and Verbena offici- 
nalis occurred at Bennett's Bridge. The scenery has become 
wooded and beautiful. Colchicum autumyiale still occurs. The two 
commoner Spargani^ims [S. minimum and S. ramosum), Oriyanum, 
Phalaris, and liuuiex Hydrolapathum were seen to Thomastown on 
the right bank. Alliitm vineale and Lysimachia vulgaris occurred 
freely at Mount Juliet, the seat of Lord Carrick. Near this, too, 
Campanula Trachelium was very plentiful in wet thickets near the 
river and at its very edge. Between Thomastown and Innistiogue 
I noted the Campajiula, the large water-dock, Centaurea Scahiosa, 
Ononis arvensis, Orchis pi/ramidalis, Scahiosa ((rrensis, and Kpiluhium 
hirsutum as the species of most interest. At Innistiogue we stopped 
for the night in a most delightfully clean, well- supplied, and 
prettily- situated inn. 

About Innistiogue, on old ivied walls, Orobanche hcdera is 
abundant. The great attraction to this little village is the 
beautiful demesne of Woodstock, at the gate of which it lies. 
The gardens of Woodstock are famous, and an hour or two were 
well spent in them under the guidance of a most intelligent Irish 
gardener. With especial pride he showed us a magnificent 
Araucaria, over fifty feet high. This, he stated, was the second 
best in the kingdom, the best being at Dropmore, which was 
planted a year earlier, the Woodstock one being planted in 1834. 
As a matter of fact the two oldest in the kingdom date from 1796, 
one at Kew and the other at Dropmore, the latter being, I believe, 
the best grown, and about sixty feet high. There is also here a 
double line of younger Araucaria: (1850), about 300 yards in 
length, with a grass lane between, under which circumstances they 
show to peculiar advantage. 

In the woods above the river, on the right bank, Carex pendula, 
Luzula pilosa, and the wood onion, occurred. Blackcaps were 
singing in many cases ; they are local birds in Ireland. I met 
them in a similar and almost as beautiful place by the Barrow, at 
Borris, the previous year. 

From a little below Woodlands Campanula Tracheluou becomes 
most abundant, all along the river amongst the coarsest weeds on 
dykes and embankments, and in tangled thickets at the water's 
edge to New Boss. I found it very sparingly the previous year near 
Portarlington, on the Barrow ; the Nore, on which it has been long- 
known, is its most satisfactory habitat in Ireland. 

From Woodstock to New Boss, along the edge of the Nore on 
the right bank, is a kind of exploit in pedestrianism which demands 
some enthralling motive to make it go cheerfully. The river is 
tidal, and the osier banks and beds of reeds are often intersected 
by stagnant, sunken courses of slimy water on a bed of " glar."

Wide detours are sometimes imperative ; but when one is tired it 
is astonishing how much filthy wading will be endured in pre- 
ference to a wide detour. My friend, however, retired far inland. 
I foimd along here, in the order quoted, (Enanthe Lachenaid. 
Scirpus maritimus (first symptom of saline growth), Carex pendula, 
iilyceria aquatica, Carex riparia, Aster s-p. ? [A. lavis f), (Encmthe 
Jistulosd, Apium graveolens, Hordeuin prutense (a very rare grass), to 
Ballyueale. From Ballyneale onwards Lycopus europams, Dipsacus 
sylrestre, Orobanche hedercv. were met with, and (Jlyceria, Campanula, 
and Carex riparia occurred to below the junction of the Nore and 
the Barrow. 

We arrived at New Eoss in the afternoon of July 9th. On the 
following day we made use of the steamer to Waterford, and thence 
by rail to Cappoquin for the Blackwater. The Nore had been a 
decided disappointment compared with the Barrow. Both in 
scenery and botany the more western river exhibits a falling off. 
Bits of the Nore, as about Woodstock and Brown's Barn, are nearly 
as good as Graignenamanagh or St. MuUins, on the BarroAV, but 
there is far more monotony along the Nore. The decrease in the 
rarer plants can easily be seen by referring to my paper on the 
Barrow in the ' Journal of Botany ' for January, 1885. 

On the 11th of July we steamed down the Blackwater Estuary 
from Cappoquin to Youghal. There is not a more lovely bit of 
scenery than this in the British Isles. If the Blackwater yields 
fewer rare plants than the other large Irish rivers, it can at any 
rate boast that it has no rival in beauty. From Youghal to 
Mallow is about seventy miles by the river, which we walked in 
three days, and the whole distance almost lay from one well- 
wooded gentleman's place to another. On the first day, Youghal 
to Cappoquin, the waters are tidal, and we also came in for floods, 
and had many difficulties to contend with. Hideous slimy chan- 
nels, that could neither be swam, waded, nor jumped, often threw us 
far astray. In the salt-marshes near Youghal Statics bahusiensis, 
Carex vulpina, C. extensa, (Enanthe Lachenalli, Apinm, and other 
commoner kinds occurred. Eqaisetum maximum may also be men- 
tioned. Carex jmniculata, Scrophnlaria aquatica, Carex riparia, 
Litliuspermum arvense, were the most interesting plants along 
the left bank to Villierstown. Near Cappoquin Elodca canadensis 
has established itself. 

On the following day (July 12) we kept the right bank up the 
river to Lismore. Near Cappoquin Carex pendula was found, and 
farther on Xasturtiuin palustre and Lycopus europccus appeared. At 
Lismore, or rather a little above the bridge, a fine clump of 
Butoiniis umbellatus, in full flower, was a most refreshing variety. 
Rumex Hydrolapatliuin, Scropliularia aquatica, and Mentha rotundi- 
folia occurred here, the latter in two places, one below Lismore, 
and quite established. This mint is not (probably) native in 
Ireland. Xasturtium palustre is very abundant, and much larger 
than I have seen it elsewhere in Ireland along here. Carex 
vesicaria, Scirpus sylvaticus, Lysimachia cuhjaris, Lycopus, Ejiihjbiuin 
hirsutum, Aparyia hispida, Symphytum ajjicinale, Limpinella iiiayna,

and Saponaria ojficinalis were gathered to Ballyduff. From 
Cappoquin the walking has been splendid, firm banks with a good 
hard sward, and just a reasonable amount of impediments. Near 
Fermoy liutomus occurred again, and with it Nasturtium sylvestre. 

Since ]>allyduff we have been in the County Cork. The 
Blackwater lies chiefly in this county, a small portion at the north- 
west end, where it rises, being in Kerry, while the last twenty miles 
of its course are in Waterford. Cork has received more special 
attention at the hands of botanists than any other Irish county, 
and I may here refer to the latest work on the subject by the Eev. 
Thos. Allin, Avhose flora renders it unnecessary for me to mention 
species which he has shown to be common in the county. 

Having passed the night in a capital hotel in Fermoy we 
followed the left bank up the river to Mallow on the 13th. At 
Castle Hyde, a lovely place, I noticed Epipactis latifolia, Armaria 
trinervia, and Oruhanche Hedera;. At Ballyhooly I saw (JEnanthe 
Phellandrium, the only place in the Blackwater it occurred. About 
a mile above Cregg Castle, on the left bank, I found a real rarity, 
AUiiuii Scorudnjirasum. I met with it again on the same bank at 
the lower part of Norreys Castle demesne near Mallow. It was 
growing in small grassy thickets near the stream in each locality, 
and had all the appearance of a native, not being on the brink, as 
species conveyed by the river usually are. The only other stations 
for this Allium in Ireland are Foaty Island, in Cork, and thickets at 
Killarney. Near Killawillin fhiphurhia kiberna was first met with ; 
it is found as far east, however, as Cappoquin.* Geranium lucidum 
and Lithuspermwii arcense were fi'equently seen. The decrease in 
the interesting river species as we travelled west was most note- 
worthy. Gradually they all disappeared, giving place to few species 
of any interest in their stead. About three miles above Mallow, 
which we left on the morning of the 14th, I met with Nasturtium 
amphibium in a drain leading to the river on the left bank. I will 
not positively commit myself to this locality, as I unfortunately did 
not secure a specimen ; but being very familiar with the plant I 
can hardly have made a mistake. It is very rare in Cork, Mr. 
Allin being only able to supply two localities. Kuphorbia hiberna ' 
and (Enanthe crocata are consj)icuous plants to Mill Street, and 
with regard to the rest I have simply noted " all common." 

From Mallow the Blackwater had neither botany nor beauty, 
so we bade it good-bye at Mill Street, and went westwards to 
Killarney, and thence over the Eeeks to Sneem. In spongy bogs 
behind Sneem I found lihijnchospora fusca and Carcx liiiiosa in some 
profusion, and at Derryquin, near Sneem, Lijcopus europmts, not a 
common plant in Kerry, occurs by the roadside. 

From Keumare we crossed by Cleonee and Inchiquin Lakes to 
Glengarifi', back again from Kerry to the County Cork. About 
Cleonee Iwtrijehium Lunaria, Utricularia intermedia, and Eriucaulun 
septantjulare Avere gathered. At Inchiquin Lake a natural wood of 
some extent of holly, oak, alder, birch, hazel, crab-apple, and 

* [I found it still further east in 18«0, a CoUigan, near Dungarvan, 
Co. Waterford. — Ed. Journ. Bot.j

Viburnum occurs. The floor of it is literally paved with Saxifraga 
hirsuta and S. umhrosa. Irish spurge and the two filmy ferns are 
also common. This wood is called Uragh Wood. In it I found 
also Carex pallesccns and Neottia Nidus-avis. The latter is very 
rare in Ireland, and has not been found in the South of Ireland 
below Wicklow previously. Near Glengariff Scrophularia aquatica, 
Anthcmis nobilis, Carex lirnosa, Uadiola Milletjrana, and Scutellaria 
galericulata were found on the way to Berehaveu. The Scutellaria, 
with the smaller one, S. minor, grows on the limestone shingle 
close by the edge of the sea in Bearhaven Bay, near Adrigoole, an 
unusual situation. On bare rocky mountains above Glen Lough, 
north-east from Adrigoole, I gathered Sai/ina snbulata and Juniperus 
nana, both very rare in Cork. In one at least of the many lakes 
here Eriocaulon septangulare is abundant, an important addition to 
Mr. Alhn's Flora. 

In the foregoing herborization the following species are addi- 
tions to the Flora of District 3 of ' Cybele Hibernica ' and its 
Supplement : — 

Nasturtium sylvestre. Mercurialis perennis. 

Armoracia amphibia. Piuniex Hydrolapathum. 

(Enanthe fistulosa. Sparganium minimum. 

QL. Lachenalii. Carex pendula. 

(E. Phellandrium. C. riparia. 

Slum angustifolium. Luzula pilosa. 

*Matricaria Chamomilla. Hordeum pratcnse. 

Xeottia Nid^ts-avis is an addition to the Flora of District 1, its 
locality being just inside the Kerry boundary, and Eriocatdon sept- 
angulare is an addition to the Flora of Cork ; while new localities 
are given for several rare species, notably Allium. Scorodoprasum. 
and Rhynchvspora fusca. 



THE MOSS FLOEA OF SUFFOLK. 
By the Eev. E. N. Bloomfield, M.A. 

On looking at the last edition of the ' London Catalogue of 
British Mosses and Hepatics,' it will be observed that the compilers 
knew little for certain of the Moss Flora of the Ouse Province, 
which comprises the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, (fee. 

I think it may not be amiss, therefore, to brmg together all the 
information I can procure as to the Flora of one of these counties, 
which may be taken as a fair specimen of the productions of the 
> 'ovince. 

I am fortunate in possessing very trustworthy materials for this 
enumeration in the case of the county of Suffolk. I have a good 
number of specimens from the late Mr. E. Skepper, of Bury 
St. Edmunds, Co-editor of the ' Flora of Suffolk.' These are sup- 
plemented by specimens gathered by the late Mr. F. K. Engle, 



234 THE MOSS FLOKA OF SUFFOLK. 

also of Bury, kindly communicated by Mrs. Skepper ; and also 
some from the late l)r. White, of Lavenham. In addition to these, 
I have a good many specimens from the Eev. W. M. Hind, LL.D., 
of Honington, and also some from Mr. W. Jordan, of Cockfield, 
while I have gathered a few myself, both in East and West 
Suffolk. These specimens have been verified, and in not a few in- 
stances determined by Mr. H. Boswell, of Oxford. 

By permission of Mrs. Skepper, the moss herbarium formed by 
i\Ir. E. Skepper was sent to the Eev. James Eergusson, of Fern 
Brechin, who has carefully examined it and favoured me with 
copious notes on the species contained in it. 

Thus I am able to employ the nomenclature of the ' London 
Catalogue,' with the assurance that few errors are likely to have 
crept in, at any rate as regards the specimens examined. 

The principal omissions will be the new critical species of such 
genera as Sphagnum, Burbula, Bryxim &c., which have not been 
collected to any extent. 

Mr. Skepper's and Dr. White's specimens were mostly collected 
about the years 1860—62. Mr. F. K. Eagle's, in the first half of 
the present century ; only one or two packets having dates. 

The western division of the county has been fairly well 
searched, and I have a pretty good set of specimens from it. The 
eastern division has only been examined, to any extent, near 
Yarmouth, in the beginning of the present century, by such good 
observers as Sir W. Hooker and Messrs. Dawson Turner, Dick- 
son, &c. 

In order to indicate the distribution, as far as I can at present, 
I have added E. = Eastern Division, W. = Western Division, but 
if neither of these marks are added it shows that specimens have 
been examined fr'om both. 

When we have seen no specimens the mark * is affixed. In all 
other cases I have had specimens myself, or there are some in 
Mr. Skepper's herbarium, or Mr. D. Turner's herbarium, fide 
Wilson in Bry. Brit. ; but if in these exclusively Sk. Herb, or 
Turner Herb, is added to the locality. Where a species has not 
been met with in the vice-county since Mr. Eagle's time, but I 
have specimens collected by him, I have added (Eagle), but these 
are for the most part species easily overlooked. 

The ' Natural History of Yarmouth,' which is quoted so often, 
is by Messrs. Paget (i. e., Sir James Paget and his brother), and 
was published in the year 1834. 

The parishes of Tuddenham and Wangford, mentioned in this 
list, are the parishes of those names in West Suffolk, both lying in 
the sand tract to the north-west of the county, sometimes called the 
Breck District. 

Where no localities are given, the species is believed to be 
somewhat generally distributed,^ as indeed are many others for 
which localities are given here. The localities given are in most 
cases those only from which specimens have been examined.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S. 

(Coutiuued from p. 209). 

Wrightia flavido-rosea Trim. — Brandies cylindric, the young 
twigs finely pubescent ; leaves lanceolate, tapering at botli ends or 
slightly caudate-acuminate, sessile, entire, membranous, rather 
rough on both surfaces, with short hairs scattered on the veins ; 
venation prominent and reticulated beneath ; cymes 3-flowered, 
two or three together at the ends of the branches ; pedicels long, 
much thickened upwards, iiubescent; buds pointed; calyx-segments 
broadly oval-triangular, obtuse, thick and gibbous at base, mem- 
branous at edges ; scales small, ovate, alternate with the segments; 
corolla with the short tube one-third longer than the calyx-segments ; 
lobes oval-oblong, obtuse or subacute, puberulous on both sides, 
not fleshy, orange-salmon-coloured, becoming purplish grey when 
withering; coronal scales of the same colour, 10 sti-ap-shaped, cut 
one-third down into 3 filamentous segments and 10 undivided 
linear ; anthers with a tuft of white hairs at summit, pubescent 
externally, dirty white ; style thickened upward ; stigma with two 
short papilbe on summit ; fruit not seen. 



NOTES ON THE FLOKA OF CEYLON. 239 

Hab. Near the foot of Doluwe Kande, north of Kurunegala, 
N. W. Province, May, 1884. 

A small tree with very tough and fibrous inner bark. Branch- 
lets thickened at the nodes. Leaves 4-6 in. long, deep apple-green, 
paler beneath. Flowers large, 1^ in. across, the tube of corolla 
 | in. Coronal scales a darker colour than the corolla-lobes, and 
arranged thus : — The 6 outermost trifid ones opposite the corolla- 
lobes and adherent to them for their lower one-third, the 5 inner 
trifid ones alternate with these and immediately outside the sta- 
mens ; the 10 undivided ones in pairs between the bases of 
the stamens.* The flowers, when quite dry, become dull 
bluish grey ; both they and the leaves, when fresh, are full of a 
milky juice. 

This is no doubt the plant doubtfully referred to by Thwaites 
(Enum. p. 193) as IF. Bothii, var. puherida. The specimen (C. P. 
1837) is from Dambulla, collected by Gardner. In the ' Fl. Brit. 
Ind.' (iii., p. 653) W. Ruthil G. Don is placed as a variety under 
W. tmctorin, but neither is given for Ceylon. Our plant does not 
well agree with Eoth's description (Nov. PI. Sp., p. 121), but it 
ought perhaps to form no more than a subspecies of W. tinctoria. 
From the ordinary forms of that species (which is met with in 
Ceylon in cultivation only) it differs remarkably in the colour of 
the flowers (which are always white in W. tinctoria), and in the 
more slender habit, form of the leaves, &c. 

The change of colour undergone by the flower before withering 
is analogous to that of W. tomentosa. In that species the corolla 
(which is thick, fleshy and brittle, and has an unpleasant scent) is 
at first pale dull greenish-ochre (quite green externally), the corona 
alone being salmon-coloured, but soon the whole changes into a 
dull inky-purple. Hence the discrepancies in descriptions as to 
colour alluded to in 'Fl. Brit. India.' In this species the coronal 
scales are coherent, forming a fleshy, truncate, somewhat 5-lobed, 
short tube or ring. 

Tylophora flava Trim.   — Absolutely glabrous in all parts ; 
leaves ovate or oblong-ovate, cordate at base, rounded and suddenly 
acuminate at apex, thick and fleshy, rather glaucous, yellowish 
green, with paler conspicuous veins ; petiole very short, without 
glands ; peduncles very short, usually dichotomous ; flowers on 
slender pedicels, crowded on the contracted branches so as to be 
sub-umbellate in axils of very small acicular bracts ; calyx-segments 
long, lanceolate, quite glabrous or occasionally with a few bristly 
hairs ; corolla-lobes ovate-oblong, subacute, pale greenish yellow, 
the throat stained Avith purple ; coronal processes adnate to the 
gynostegium at the base, and there broad and fleshy, tapering 
above into thick triangular incurved points reaching the stigmatic 
table ; fruit-carpels spreading in a line, each about 3:^ in. long, 
linear, tapering to a blunt point, cylindrical, smooth. 

* In IViifihtia zeylanica there is a further (-Ith) row of these bodies, con- 
sisting of five more pairs of erect undivided filaments, just outside and opposite 
to the stamens. In W. anriustifulia Thw. there is but one row of live tritid and 
laciniate bodies alternate with the petals. 



240 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

Hab. Abundant on the sandy coast southward from Colombo 
with other sea-shore plants, and conspicuous from the bright 
colour of its foliage. Leaves often nearly 5 in. long, more or less 
bullate ; petioles not ^ in. long. Pedicels about ^ in., soon dis- 
articulating at the bract-axil. Flowers ^ in. diam. 

This I should have regarded as a maritime variety of T. 
ostJimatica, but for the different form of the coronal processes. 
These in that species are very abruptly narrowed into a short 
filiform point, instead of gradually tapering off, as in T. flaca. The 
other points of difference are the complete glabrosity, shorter 
peduncles and pedicels, larger flowers of a different colour, and 
narrow follicles. Thwaites' var. (jlahra of T. asthmatica (C. P. 1849) 
may be this plant in part, but the specimens here are insufficient 
to decide. Hooker (Fl. Brit. Ind., iv., p. 40) refers it to T. pauci- 
flora W. & A., but with some doubt. 

Christisonia (Oligopholis) Thwaitesii Trim. — C. unicolor 
Thw. Enum. PI. Zeyl. p. 222, pro max. part., ? Gardner. — C. neil- 
f/herrica Hk. f. Fl. Brit. Ind. iv. p. 322, pro parte, non Gardn. — 
Flowering-stem short and stout, bearing 3-8 large flowers on rather 
long thick pedicels from axils of obtuse or rounded scales, not 
crowded ; pedicels naked, with no bracts beneath the flowers ; 
calyx over 1 in. long, glabrous, completely closed in the bud and 
produced into a point, so that the bud is beaked, semispathaceous, 
dee];)ly 2-cleft, the lips usually more or less deeply cut into 2 and 8 
teeth ; corolla large, infundibuliform, curved, glabrous externally, 
uniform pale yellow; stamens scarcely exserted; filaments glabrous; 
both pairs of anthers coherent, the upper with short, the lower with 
very long spurs projecting forward; style a little longer than sta- 
mens and more exserted ; stigma large, broad, crescent-shaped or 
reniform ; placentas large, fleshy, meeting in the centre, and 
ovaliferous throughout, except where in contact. 

Hab. Palagalla, Oct. 1853. (C. P. 2971 in Herb. Perad.). 

"Whole plant of a bright pale yellow colour, the flowers paler," 
quite glabrous, the rhizome short and stout. Flowers li-2 in. long, 
the corolla decidedly 2-lipped. I have not seen this living ; it is 
described from good herbarium-specimens and an excellent coloured 
drawing. Thwaites' short description of C. unicolor [loc. cit.) was 
clearly principally made from this plant, but the old coloured 
drawing, which was the whole foundation of Gardner's species, 
seems to have been also used. This old figure is very unsatisfactory, 
but, as it shows two bracts beneath each flower, it is apparently a 
different species, and may be perhaps rightly placed under C. 
neihjherriva, as done by Sir J. Hooker; the flowers are small, and 
the calyx nearly truncate. But as no specimens corresponding with 
this figure exist,* C. unicolor Gardn. must ever remain inde- 
terminable. 

C. neilgherrica is rightly made synonymous with Cawphellia 

* C. P. 1780, quoted doubtfully by Thwaites for C. iniicolor, is represented 
here by a single flower, not named, but collected by Gardner. It is probably C. 
hlcolor.

cytinoides Wight in the 'Fl. Brit. India,' but this is very distinct 
from the plant above described. It is not infrequent in the high 
mountainous forests here, growing on the roots of Strohilanthes, and 
I have had several opportunities of examining fresh specimens. I 
am inclined to think Wight's genus a good one, and its reunion 
with Christisonia by Sir J. Hooker to be uncalled for. The structure 
of the anthers is very different in CamphelUa; they are strictly one- 
celled, open by a terminal pore, and are quite free from one another 
and without spores ; the style, too, is different, being hooked, 
ovoid, and quite entire. The genera are, however, closely allied, 
and their station away from one another in different natural orders, 
as in the ' Gen. Plant.,'* is as clearly an extreme in the opposite 
dh-ection. The structure of the ovary and placentas is quite the 
same in both genera, truly one-celled in all I have examined, 
except occasionally near the base. 

C. ThwaitesU, from its ebracteolate pedicels and large fleshy 
placentas, is referable to Wight's genus OligophoUs, which is 
generally regarded as not distinct from Christisonia ; but this also 
requires further examination of fi'esh specimens, which I hope 
I may get the opportunity of making. 

Christisonia bicolor Gardn., var. spectabilis. — C. spectabilis Thw. 
ms, — Differs from var.  pallidijiora Thw. (C. pallida Gardn.) in its 
much larger size, the flowers reaching 3 in. in length, with a more 
spreading limb, which is pure white, the tube being yellow and the 
calyx pink ; the rhizome is much stouter. 

Hab. The Eaiuckles Hill, Kallebokka Vallev, Central Prov., 
Sept. 1868. (C. P. 3983 in Herb. Perad.). A very beautiful 
variety of this variable species, connected with the type through 
forms of pallidi/lora. 

Scutellaria spicata Trim. — Stem stout, erect, densely covered 
with short deflexed hairs ; leaves ovate or ovate-oblong, on hairy 
petioles, cordate or subcordate at base, obtuse at apex, strongly 
crenate, nearly glabrous above, densely velvety-hairy on the 
prominent veins beneath ; flowers few, very shortly stalked or 
subsessile, forming a terminal erect unbranched spicate inflorescence 
3-4 in. long ; bracts broadly oval, longer than the pedicel, all 
densely hairy, with spreading hairs; calyx longer than in other 
Ceylon species, strongly pilose ; corolla very large, the tube wide, 
hairy without, the segments very wide. 

Hab. By streams on Adam's Peak, at about 5500 ft. elevation, 
March, 1883. This may perhaps be no more than a variety of the 
common and variable ;S'. violacea ; but the very large wide -tubed 
coralla (over ^ in. in length), large bracts and nearly sessile flowers 
give it a very distinct look, and may be sufficient for specific 
separation. I have not seen a specimen of S. robnsta Beuth. (DC. 
Prod. xii. p. 418), also from Ceylon, which, from the description, 
must come very near ; and is placed by Thwaites (Enum. p. 232j 
under S. violacea. 



* Christisonia alhida Thw., referred to Cavipbellia in 'Gen. Plant.' ii. p. 967, 
is rightly put back again into Christisonia in the 'Fl. Brit. India.'

Phyllanthus (Reidia) Uakgalensis Tliw. ms. (Epistylis). 
— Leaves small, crowded, oblong-linear, very shortly stalked, 
tapering at base, acute at apex, not oblique, copiously dotted ; 
midrib prominent beneath ; stipules subfalcate, very acute, per- 
sistent ; flowers few, mostly in the upper axils ; peduncles filiform, 
nearly as long as leaves ; male perianth with 4 broadly oval, 
rounded, very obtuse, glabrous, entire segments ; female perianth 
with 6 similar segments twice the size of the male ; capsule quite 
smooth. 

Hab. None given with the specimens, but presumably Uak- 
gala Hill, Central Prov. (C. P. 4015 in Herb. Perad.). A small 
shrub with many slender twiggy branches. Leaves less than ^ in. 
long. Male perianth ^ in., female ^ in. in length. 

Differs from its nearest Ceylon allies, P. affinis, P. cinereus, &c., 
in its very broad entire perianth-segments, glabrous capsule, and 
narrow leaves, which are not at all oblique. I have not seen it in 
a living state, and the herbarium material is but scanty. 

Ficus Trimeni King ms. — Urosti(jma Tjiela Thw. Enum. 
p. 2G5, in part (nou Miq.). — "A gigantic tree with few aerial roots, 
all parts glabrous ; leaves coriaceous, oval or elliptic, with a short 
blunt apiculus, entire edges, and a slightly tapering obscurely 
3-nerved base, 3 to 4-5 in. long; midrib thick and prominent; 
lateral nerves diverging from the midrib at a low angle, slightly 
prominent when dry, numerous, close, straight, anastomosing just 
within the thickened slightly revolute margin; petioles about -75 in. 
long; stipules ovate-acuminate, •4--6 in. long. Pi.eceptacles sessile 
in pairs, axillary, globular, slightly verrucose when ripe, •4--5 in. 
across, with three small spreading ovate-cordate slightly pubescent 
basal bracts." 

Hab. Not uncommon in the Central Province, especially in the 
lower hills, at an elevation of 1000-2000 ft., as Peradeniya, 
Kaduganawa, &c. (C. P. 2220 in Herb. Perad.). 

" This species approaches F. Tsiela Roxb., and F. retusa L., 
var. nitida, but differs from both by its more numerous straight 
primary nerves, much more spreading habit, and fewer aerial 
roots" (King ms.). It is not confined to Ceylon, having been 
collected in the Indian Penmsula by Law — in Cauara, Dhurwar, 
and Bellary Districts. 

I am much indebted to Dr. King, of the Calcutta Botanic 
Gardens, for sending me the above description, which will appear 
in his forthcoming monograph of the Indian Ficus. I had 
determined the tree as F. indica L. Syst., and it is given under that 
name in my "Hand-Guide" to the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens of 
1888 (p. 23). A gigantic tree here is a well-known and prominent 
object, and is referred to by Thwaites in a note under U. Tjiela in 
his ' Enum.,' p. 265.* This tree commenced life parasitically on a 
Jack-tree, which it strangled and superseded ; it is now a mag- 
nificent specimen, with symmetrically spreading misupported 

* A photograph of the trunk of this tree was taken in 1879, and there is, if I 
remember riglitly, a copy of it in the Timber Museum at Kew Gardens. It is of 
further interest as containing a portrait of the late Dr. Tliwaites seated beneath 
the branches of the tree.

brandies covering a circle of ground over 200 ft. in diameter. 
The orange-red fruit, the size of a small cherry, is ripe in Ju.ly and 
August. 

Picus caudiculata Trim. — Leaves oblong-oval, 3-4 in. long 
by 1^-2 in. wide, rounded at the base, suddenly narrowed into a 
slender acute tail at the apex |—|- in. long, and often twisted ; mid- 
rib very strong, wide, and prominent beneath ; lateral veins well- 
marked, nearly straiglit, diverging at a wide angle, anastomosing by 
arches just within the margin, the intervening spaces evenly filled 
in with elegant rectangular reticulations raised beneath ; texture 
rather thick, glabrous, dark green above, pale beneath ; petiole f in. 
or more, channelled above ; stipules larger, an inch long, tapering 
into long, very acute points, membranous, orange-red, rather per- 
sistent ; receptacles sessile, solitary ?, smooth, red, as large as a 
sloe, with 2 or 3 large fused flat bracts at the base. 

Hab. Paregodde, Pasdun Korle, Western Prov., June, 1883. 

A few specimens only of this were brought in by the Garden 
collectors, and I have not yet succeeded in obtaining more ; but 
Dr. King, to whom I have submitted one of them, agrees that they 
represent a distinct species hitherto undescribed. The collectors 
described it as a large tree. The twigs are stout, with a yellow-grey 
bark, strongly marked with the scars of the fallen leaves and 
stipules. 

Elatostema lineolatum Wight, var. petiolake Thw. ms. — 
Leaves 4-5 in. long, including the petiole of ^-J in., into which the 
blade tapers gradually, narrowly lanceolate, caudate, with a long 
linear or strap-shaped tail, with 2-4 very coarse and large teeth on 
either side in upper part, entire below ; cystoliths linear, only 
showing on the under surface and on midrib and margins above, 
dark green, very pale beneath. 

Hab. Central Province, May, 18G6. (C. P. 3920 in Herb. 
Perad.). 

A remarkable form of an extremely variable species, or perhaps 
of specific distinctness. The leaves are as large as m var. majus 
Wedd., and, besides the presence of a petiole, are remarkable for 
the absence of cystoliths on their upper surface, which becomes 
dark brown after drying. 

Dendrobium albidulum Thw. ms. — Small, casspitose ; 
pseudo-bulbs about | in. long, oblong-ovoid, pale green when 
young, afterwards yellow and wrinkled ; leaves about 4, the 
sheaths wide, membranous, and striate ; blade f-lj in. long, 
linear-lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate, acute or subacute, somewhat 
twisted, bright apple-green ; midrib prominent beneath ; racemes 
terminal, usually solitary, rarely 2, with 1-5 small flowers on 
slender pedicels twice or thrice as long as the subtending acuminate 
bracts ; sepals and petals oblong-lanceolate, acute, nearly equal, 
the petals a little narrower, spreading, all pure white ; labellum 
rhomboidal, attenuated at base, 3-lobed, the lateral lobes short 
acute, the central one rounded, subacute, with the margin creuate 
and crisped, all pale green finely dotted with claret-colour, the 
centre of the basal half occupied by a two-grooved ridge ending in 



244 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

3 small projecting teeth ; spur short, blunt, flattened, slightly 
curved ; column short, prolonged below, winged, white with claret 
dots ; capsule broadly or roundish-ovoid. 

Hab. Common on tree-trunks in the higher hill-forests, as 
about Kakgala, whence the specimens named by Thwaites were 
collected, Oct. 1866. (C. P. 3926 in Hb. Perad.*). 

A small but rather pretty little species, the flowers about | in. 
across, slightly nodding. It appears to be near D. micruholhon A. 
Eich. [D. hinnile Wight Ic. t. 1643), which has, however, larger and 
more numerous flowers of a different colour, and with a sharp spur. 

Bulbophyllum crassifolmm Thw. ms. — Small ; pseudo- 
bulbs small, numerous, about the size of a pea, nearly spherical, 
smooth ; leaves solitary, ^-f in. long, sessile, very fleshy, oval, 
obtuse, the midrib marked by a furrow above ; flowers solitary, 
each on a very short peduncle in the sheath of a short truncate 
bract ; sepals nearly equal, broadly ovate, the upper one erect, 
arched, the lateral ones spreading, yellowish green, densely and 
minutely j)unctate with red ; petals minute, broad, truncate ; 
labellum very small, tongue-shaped, obtuse, white. 

Hab. On the trunk of a tree, Kukul Korle, Western Pro v., 
Sept. 1865. (C. P. 3879 in Herb. Perad.). 

A very small and inconspicuous species, of which I have only 
seen the herbarium specimens above described. Belongs apparently 
to the elegnns section, but remarkable for its very small solitary 
flowers. The leaves are dark green, and very like those of some 
Hoija. The above description is principally taken from a MS. note 
of Dr. Thwaites. 

Cleisostoma Thwaitesianum Trim. — C. maculosa Thw. 
Enum. p. 304, non Liudl. — An C. decipiens Lindl. ? — Leaves large, 
8-10 in. long by 1 in. or more wide, distichous on the short stem, 
obliquely emarginate at apex, thick, flat, dotted with minute purple 
spots beneath, especially near the base ; inflorescence 2-6 in. long, 
unbranched or with a few slender curved ascending branches ; 
flowers small, numerous, sessile ; sepals and petals nearly alike, 
half-spreading, oval or oval-oblong, subacute, lemon-yellow, with 
large vinous-red stains ; labellum small, broader than long, entire, 
paler yellow ; spur short, broad, blunt, gibbous ; capsule about 
 J in. long, linear oblong, ribbed ; seeds golden-yellow. • 

Hab. Not an uncommon orchid on trees in the moist low 
country. The specimens described were collected at Heneratgoda, 
Western Prov., in February of the present year (1885). (C. P. 3193 
in Herb. Perad.). 

Mr. Bcntham, in Gen. Plant, iii. p. 581, has pointed out that 
this plant is not the C. nua-ulosiim of Lindley (to which he refers 
the Ceylon plant called by Thwaites Saccolabiuiii iincolatum), but 
seems to be a new species near C. WemUandonnn Echb. f.f 
Bentham states that he had not seen specimens, but only a drawing ; 
this, however, if as I suppose a copy of the one in the Herbarium 

* Sj^ecimens are also to be found under C. P. 2353 mixed with those of 
I). iHinduratum Lindl., which it a good deal resembles, 
t I have not seen the description of this species. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 245 

here, is a very accurate representation of the plant. I have had, 
therefore, to re-name the species; which I do witli some hesitation, 
as it seems not improbable that C. dccipiens Lindl. in Bot. Mag. 
1844, Misc. p. 11, may be the same. This species is from Ceylon; 
but the description is brief, and in the form and colour of the sepals 
and petals, and some other points, does not quite agree with that 
above given. 

Disperis zeylanica Trim. — D. ttipetaloidea Lindl. in part (non 
Drijopeici tripetaluides Thouars) ; Thw. Enum. p. 311. — Flowers with 
the lateral sepals connate for their lower half; labellum deeply 
bifid, with long linear divaricate lobes. 

It is noted by Mr. S. Moore, in Fl. Mauritius, p. 331, that the 
Ceylon plant is evidently different from the Mascarene D. tri- 
petaloides, and indeed the above characters abundantly distinguish it. 

This singular little i^lant is found amongst decaying leaves and 
rocks in the forests of the lower hills, now, however, mostly cleared. 
It flowers in April and May, which is the period at which the 
majority of our orchids blossom. I also met with it in the Nilgiris, 
South India, below Coonoor, in 1883 ; where there is also a second 
species of this curious chiefly African genus. 

Curcuma oligantha Trim. — Small ; tubers oblong-ovoid or 
fusiform ; leaves petiolate, the petioles dilated into long sheaths 
below ; blade oval, acute at both ends, much undulated, glabrous, 
thin, with distmct veins and transverse veiulets ; flowering-scape 
appearing with the new leaf-shoot and given off' from the axil of 
one of its basal scales, short and slender, with two or three blunt 
brown scales, terminated by the very reduced spike of 4-6 erect 
acuminate bracts, all of which are floriferous ; flowers very few, 
large, erect, as long as the spike, white ; corolla-tube 1 in. long, 
slender, white ; segments long, acuminate-obtuse, pinkish, the 
posterior rather longer and more acute, petaloid ; staminodes sub- 
acute, crisped, pure white ; labellum large and broad, rather deeply 
bifid, white, with lemon-yellow stains in the throat ; anther short ; 
basal spurs rather long, curved ; seeds without an aril, oblong, 
grey, shining. 

Hab. Uma-oya, near the Maha-weli Eiver, north-west of 
Badulla, Cent. Province, Oct. 1884. A small plant for this genus. 
Tubers 1-1 i in. long. Leaf-blades 5-7 in. long, the texture 
remarkably thin, of a bright light transparent green. The flowering- 
scape and young tuft of leaves are on one and the same new axis, 
which is given off" laterally from the old root-stock. Bracts about 
1 in. long, pale green. A single flower only is open at once in each 
spike, and as it stands up much above the bracts the scape appears 
at first sight to be one-flowered. 

This species is allied to C. alhiflora Thw., figured well in Bot. 
Mag. t. 5909, and, like that, has no terminal tuft of empty bracts, 
as in the rest of the genus. The texture of the leaves in C oliijaiit/ui 
is very unlike that of all other species of Curcuma. 

I have no doubt that the fragmentary specunens (C. P. 3700) 
from Auaradhapura mentioned by Thwaites (Enum. p. 316j are to 
be referred to this species.

P. flabelliformis Lindl. is doubtless the nearest ally of Mr. 
Ford's trouvaille, which however differs, as shown by Blume's 
beautiful figure and analyses, "^^^ by the shape and extreme villosity 
of the middle lobe of the labellum, by the form of the leaves, and 
especially by the very remarkable raised plate over the alternate 
nerves, equally noticeable in the living and dry plant, nothing 
approaching which can I anywhere find recorded. 

I am not aware that any species of Pogonia has hitherto been 

recorded from China, but I have a lovely species (§ Eupoyonia[ 

gathered in May 1881 on wet rocks near Wu hu, in the province 

of An liwei, at an altitude of 3000 feet, by Mr. Bullock, with bright 

scarlet flowers (according to the collector) an inch and more in 

length, and a fimbriate labellum. Furthermore, the Eev. B. C. 

Henry collected on the Lo fau shan range, in May 1883, at an 

elevation of 2500 feet and upwards, a plant which I am inclined to 

refer to P. opliio(jlossuides Nutt. (already known from Japan), though 

the blossoms are conspicuously smaller. 

I may take the opportunity of stating that Mr. Ford has quite 

recently found very sparingly, on Mount Parker, Hongkong, a Vri/da//- 

zynea, which does not appear to differ from the Javanese V. nuda Bl.

TULIPA SYLVESTRIS IN NoRTHAJMPTONSHIRE. Tbis plailt WaS foimcl 

in flower, in April, at Courteenhall, Northants, by Sir Herewald 
Wake, wbo kindly gave me a specimen. It seems to be undoubtedly 
tbe wild plant, and bas not been liitberto recorded for tbe county. 
Sir Herewald Wake tells me tliat be bas noticed tbe plant for 
several years, but tbis is tbe first time be bas seen it in flower. — 
H. N. Dixon. 

Cakex elongata L. in Scotland. — Mr. J. McAndrew bas sent 
specimens of tbe above species from Kenmore Holms, in Kirkcud- 
brigbtsbire, extending its nortbern distribution from Cumberland. 
It grows at tbe same station wbere Mr. McAndrew found Calama- 
grostis lanccoJata last year, its only certain Scottisb babitat. — 
Arthur Bennett. 

Calamagrostis strigosa Hartm. in Britain. — In Dr. Smiles' 
'Life of Eobert Dick, of Tburso,' it is mentioned tliat Dick found 
at Locb Duran, Caitbness, "tbe Lapland Eusb, Calaviagrostis 
lirpponica" (of Hooker, not of Wablberg). Wben calling Mr. J. 
Grant's attention to tbis, be wrote, "Tbe Locb is now (1883) 
drained, and I fear tbe plant is lost, but tliere are many specimens 
in Dick's Herbarium at Tburso." Mr. Grant supposed tbose to be 
C. stricta Nutt. ; and it was not until tbis year tbat be could make 
a tborougb searcli of tbe marsby ground still left. He bas been 
successful, and on sending me specimens tbe otber day I found 
tbey were certainly not tbe Irisb form, but were eitbcr C. borealis 
Lfest. or C. strigosa Hartm. ; but, baving specimens of neitber, I 
asked Mr. N. E. Brown, at Kew, to compare tbem. His answer 
was — " C. strigosa Hartm. ; altbougb tbe ligule is not so acute as 
tbe typical plant, still I do not see wbat else it can be." Nor do I, 
for altbougb C. stricta Nutt. (= Deyeuxia neglecta Kuntli) varies a 
good deal in tbe lengtb of tbe glumes and bairs, still in C. strigosa 
tbe glumes are longer. I bave specimens of C. stricta in wbicb tbe 
glumes are nearly as long as described for C. borealis, wbicb tbe 
Caitbness plant resembles in tbis respect. It is a rare species in 
Europe, being only known for Nortb Norway, Lapland, and Finland. 
— Arthur Bennett. 

Castanea sativa Mill, as a Native of Britain. — Tbe Spanisb 
Cbestnut bas usually been considered as baving very doubtful 
claims to be considered as indigenous to tbis country, as it com- 
paratively rarely occurs in woods or otber situations wbere it is 
not likely to bave been planted. Watson, Bentbam and Sir J. D. 
Hooker regard it as alien to Britain, as also does Nyman (Consp. 
Fl. Europ.). Wbat seems conclusive evidence as to its baving 
occurred in our island from very early times is furnisbcd by a small 
fragment of tbe wood wbicb I recently obtained during an excursion 
of tlie Geologists' Association, in a brick-eartb pit between Eritli 
and Cray ford, Kent. In tins pit tbe cbalk bas been eroded to a 
very considerable deptb, and tbe depression bas been filled up witb

brick-earth deposited in the old river-bed. It was in the lowest 
part of this stratum that the wood was found, together with palaeo- 
lithic flint-flalces. Bones of the rhinoceros have been also found in 
the same pit, and in contemporaneous deposits remains of two other 
species of rhinoceros, the mammoth, and Irish elk, together with 
bones of still existing animals. There can be no doubt, therefore, 
of the date of the fragment, and it is hardly likely to have been 
introduced at so early a date. It is to be regretted that so little 
attention has been paid to the flora of Pleistocene times. Kemains 
of plants have been found from time to time, but have been generally 
disregarded and not preserved. — H. N. Eidley. 

Fruit and Seed of Eomecon chionantha. — Although I have 
had this interesting plant in cultivation ever since its discovery, I 
have not been able to coax it to ripen fruit. It has, however, set 
one or two this spring in the Hongkong Gardens, and I am 
indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Ford, the Superintendent, for the 
opportunity of examining one of these ; and am thus enabled to 
render the generic character more complete : — 

Capsula stipitata, oblonga, a basi usque ad apicem dehiscens, 
valvis placentas duas cum stylo persistente nudantibus. Semina 
oblonga, testa Crustacea, pallide brunnea, in sicco tuberculata, 
raphe cristata. Embryo minutus, juxta basin albuminis carnoso- 
oleosi, flaventis, situs. 

It will be seen that Eomecon differs (so far as carpological 
characters are concerned) from Sangumaria only by the capsule- 
valves becoming free from the base and remaining attached at the 
apex, instead of the contrary mode of dehiscence, and by the seeds 
bei^g tuberculate and smooth. — H. F. Hance. 

'"^ACciNiuM FoRBEsii. — In tlius naming a new Vaccinium from 
Sumatra in Mr. H. 0. Forbes' recent work, ' Wanderings of a 
Naturalist ' (p. 278), I overlooked a species from Africa already named 
Vacciniuvi Forbesii by Sir W. J. Hooker ; I therefore propose the 
name V. Dempoense for the Sumatran species, from the locality. 
Mount Dempo, where Mr. Forbes discovered it. — W. Fawcett. S^

The first volume of the Botany of 'The Voyage of H.M.S. 
Challenger' has appeared; it is entirely the work of Mr. W. B. 
Hemsley, whose name, strangely enough, does not appear on the 
title-page. The book, which is published at £2, contains four 
memoirs : — i. Eeport on our present state of knowledge of various 
Insular Floras (pp. 75) ; ii. Keport on the Botany of the Bermudas 
(pp. 135, tt. 13) ; iii. Keport on various other Islands of the Atlantic 
and Southern Oceans (pp. 299, tt. 39) ; iv. Eeport on Juan 
Fernandez, South-eastern Moluccas, and Admiralty Islands, with 
an appendix on the dispersal of plants by oceanic currents and 
birds (pp. 333, tt. 11). Each report is paged separately, but the

plates are numbered consecutively — surely an awkward arrange- 
ment. The convenience of workers would have been consulted had 
each report been issued by itself, the bulky quarto volume being 
inconvenient for reference. We hope to refer at greater length 
to this very important contribution to our knowledge of plant- 
distribution. 

Messrs. Cassell & Co. send us the first number of ' Familiar 
Trees.' The name of the author, Mr. G. S. Boulger, is sufficient 
guarantee that the literary portion of the work will be well done. 

Dr. Trimen has compiled a useful ' Systematic Catalogue of the 
Flowering Plants and Ferns indigenous to or growing wild in 
Ceylon,' arranged in accordance with the ' Genera Plautarum' and 
the ' Flora of British India,' so far as published. It is brouglit up 
to date, the new species now publishing in this Journal being 
included. The list, which forms a volume of 140 pages, may be 
obtained from Messrs. Dulau & Co., price 3&-. 6d.

ON THE CAULOTAXIS OF BEITISH FUMARIACEM. 
By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc. 

The term "caulotaxis" is here used in the sense defined in a 
previous communication to this Journal,* viz. , as a designation for the 
arrangement and relation of the central and lateral axes of a plant. 

Every practical botanist is aware that plants exhibit some 
variety in their modes of branching, and that the relative positions 
of the main axis and the branches are often much modified as 
these parts pass from the rudimentary to the mature condition. 
Of the latter fact examples are by no means difficult to meet with 
among British plants, though these are seldom or never referred to, 
even in our native text-books on Botanical Science. Hence an 
account of the caulotaxis of British FianaiiacecE may not be without 
some interest, and may possibly afford a clue to the explanation of 
other and more complicated cases.

A convenient starting-point will be afforded by the following 
description of the axis of Corydalis claviculata, drawn up some time 
ago The specimen consisted of six internodes, which formed the 
terminal portion of one of the long slender shoots characteristic of 
this species. As the specimen lay before me, the following points 
were noted : — At the Jirst node, i.e., the lowest on the specimen, 
there was a leaf on the le/t,\ and a peduncle bearing flowers 

* 'Journal of Botany,' Oct., 1882. 

t It need hardly be said that the terms left and right, as used in this 
description i'or the successive leaves, are not to be taken strictly as indicating a 
distichous pliyllotaxis.

on the right, so that the inflorescence was what systematists term 
leaf-opposed. At the second node there was a leaf on the rhjht, with 
a lateral branch in its axil ; the axillary branch terminated in three 
flowers, just below which was a leaf with an axillary branch of the 
second order. At the third node the leaf was on the left, and opposite 
to it was a peduncle bearing flowers. At ihefoxirth node there was 
a leaf on the left, with an axillary branch. At WiQ fifth node the 
leaf was on the right, and a leaf-opposed peduncle on the left. At 
the sixth node there was a, leaf on the right, and from this point the 
stem was continued into a peduncle with flowers, so that here the 
peduncle was terminal. 

From this it appears that, in the specimen described, leaf and 
axillary branch alternated regularly with leaf and opposed peduncle. 
Many other specimens subsequently examined exhibited essentially 
the same organisation, the inflorescences being invariably leaf- 
opposed, except at the apex of the shoots, where they are terminal. 
We may take it, therefore, that there is some reason for regarding 
this as the typical arrangement of leaves, branches, and inflores- 
cences, and they may represent it diagrammatically as 'in Fig. 1. 

Interpreting the arrangement on the same principles as were 
applied to the Geraniums,* it will be obvious that the long slender 
shoots of this plant are in reality pseiulaxes or sympodia, each one 
being made up of a series of successive lateral branches, which 
have become organised into a continuous axis. The leaf-opposed 
peduncles are thus the terminal portions of each section of the 
pseudaxis, which have become pushed aside by the more vigorous 
growth of the lateral shoots. Hence a rational view of the whole 
structure may be represented as in Fig. 2. 

For descriptive purposes it will be convenient in future to speak 
of the sections of the pseudaxis as ^^ caulomeres,'' and to distinguish 
the caulomeres as uninodal, binodal, &c., according to the number 
of nodes they carry. Those with more than three nodes may be 
termed multinodal. Using this language, the shoots of the speci- 
mens referred to may be described as pseudaxes, built up of binodal 
caulomeres. As stated, however, these were but the terminal 
portions of the shoots, and it became necsssary therefore to see 
whether the same structure obtained in the older parts. For this 
purpose it was deemed best to have recourse to young plants, 
whose growth and development could be watched from the earliest 
stages until they reached maturity. The results, which are sum- 
marised in the next paragraph, sliow that the formation of pseud- 
axes, in the way described, in'actically prevails over the whole 
plant, the chief point of diflerence being that in the older portions, 
one, two, or a few of the caulomeres are of a higher order than the 
binodal. 

In germination the hypocotyl elongates more or less, and raises 
the cotyledons above the soil, where, as is usual among dicotyledons, 
they present themselves as a pair of simple, entire, opposite leaves 
(Fig. 3). The leaves subsequently developed appear in pairs, which 
decussate regularly with one another, but the petioles of each pair 

* Loc. cit. 



ON THE CAULOTAXIS OF BEITISH FUMAKIACEiE. 259 

are not inserted at the same level. The interval between them is 
scarcely perceptible at the base of the stem, but becomes consider- 
able at higher levels, where the opposite and decussate phyllotaxis 
becomes changed into an alternate one (Fig. 4). This, it may be 
noted in passing, appears to be brought about by the elevation of 
one of the leaves of each pair, through unequal growth on opposite 
sides of the stem. The number of nodes between the cotyledons 
and the first inflorescence varies in different seedlings, but is 
generally an even number — four, six, or eight. In a few cases it 
appears to be odd, and may actually be so ; but this only occurs, so 
far as observation has gone, when the phyllotaxis at the first node 
above the cotyledons is strictly opposite. In either case the first 
caulomere is multinodal. After the first two or three, however, 
the caulomeres usually become binodal, and so remain throughout 
the whole length of the pseudaxis, except in some instances, where 
they change again near the apex and become uninodal. Thus, as 
a rule, each adds two leaves and two internodes to the principal 
axis, and then runs out into an inflorescence. The lower leaf of 
each often produces an axillary branch, whose organisation agrees 
with that of the principal axis, except that the basal caulomere is 
not of the same order in all cases. As intimated above, therefore, 
the whole plant is built up of a series of pseudaxes, one of which 
constitutes the main axis, while the rest form the so-called lateral 
branches. Moreover, the caulomeres are for the most part binodal, 
only the basal ones being of a higher order and the apical ones of a 
lower. 

The other species of Corydalis included in British Floras, viz., 
C. solida and C. lutea, are not regarded as true natives, though they 
are occasionally met with. No opportunity of studying their 
development has presented itself, but an examination of herbarium 
specimens is instructive. In C. solida the stem is usually simple, 
consisting of but a single multinodal caulomere, which terminates 
in a racemose inflorescence. Here, then, the organisation of the 
axis is reduced to its simplest form, and corresponds to that of the 
basal caulomere of C. claviculata. In C. lutea the stem is more or 
less branched, but both principal and subordinate shoots are 
pseudaxes, built up of caulomeres, which, except at the base and 
the apex, are generally binodal. 

Turning now to Fumaria, the other genus of the order, we find 
a caulotaxis in general agreement with that of Corydalis, though 
presenting minor modifications. Complete specimens of F. offici- 
nalis show that the phyllotaxis is at first opposite and decussate, 
but quickly becomes tetrastichous. Between the foliaceous cotyle- 
dons and the first inflorescence eight leaves are often met with, 
though there is some variety in this respect. Thus, the first caulo- 
mere is of a high order, but the rest are for the most part binodal, 
except at the apex, where they may become uninodal. Fumaria 
capreolata is in close agreement with F. ojlicinalis. The only point 
that need be referred to is, that here the leaves display a greater 
tendency to produce two buds in their axils, instead of one. When 
this occurs at a node which carries a leaf-opposed inflorescence, it

somewbat perplexes the observer at first, but further examination 
shows that the production of a second bud is a common feature at 
the other nodes also, where it occupies the same relative position, 
viz., betvi'een the Laf and the axillary shoot. As might be expected, 
the subspecies !< . confusa Jord. agrees in the main with its type; 
and the same may probably be said of the subspecies F. muralis 
Bonder., though further observations are necessary to remove the 
qualification. 

Of the species F. densifiora DC. and F. parviflora Lamk., only a 
few herbarium specimens have been examined, but these show both 
unanimity among themselves and conformity to the organisation of 
the species described. Thus, throughout the whole of this order, 
as represented in the British Isles, a remarkable unity of organisa- 
tion prevails. In all cases, save that of Corydalis solula, the main 
stem is a sympodium or pseudaxis, composed of binodal caulomeres, 
except in the basal region, where they are of a higher order, and 
often in the apical region also, where they become uninodal.

* C. subvillosa M. Bieb. is represented in the British Museum by a sheet 
from the herbarium of Roemer and Schultes, on which are fastened two 
specimens of very young C. tomentosu and a single specimen of C. pnecox. Tliis 
is labelled " Carex subinllosa, Tauria," in Bieberstein's handwriting. The speci- 
mens of C. tomoitosa do not show the fruit, which is ripe in C. jyrcecox ; so that 
if this sheet really represents Bieberstein's subvillosa, the description of the fruit 
was probably taken from that of C. pm'cox, and the species, being derived from 
an admixture of plants, must be expunged. — H. N. E.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S. 

{ Concluded from p. 245). 

Amomuni Benthamianum Trim. — Leaves lanceolate-linear, 
rather abruptly acuminate, smooth above, minutely puberulent 
beneath, sheaths and especially short rounded ligule rather densely 
covered with fulvous hairs ; peduncle from the rootstock slender, 
short ; spike capitate, very small, globose, dense ; bracts ovate, 
acute, thin, nearly glabrous ; flowers too imperfect in the specimen 
for examination ; capsule ovoid, f in. long, blunt, not ribbed, 
copiously echinate, with irregular short curved spines. 

Hab. Reigam Korle, Sept. 1864 (0. P. 3864 in Hb. Perad.). 
This C. P. number is referred to by Bentham in ' Gen. Plant.,' iii., 
p. 645, under Amomimi as " species crista lata lobis 2 rotundatis 
cum intermedio triangular! minore"; I regret that the only speci- 
men in the Herbarium here does not allow me to examine the 
flowers, but the characters of the fruit seem to show the plant to 
be distinct. 

This species comes near to A.fiilviceps Thw., which has, how- 
ever, much larger heads, densely golden-tomentose bracts, and the 
anther-crest is semilunar and slightly bifid. 

Cyanotis arachnoidea Clarke, var. obtusa Trim. — Large ; 
leaves of erect barren shoots numerous, densely placed, distichous, 
curved, bract-shaped but not keeled beneath, obtuse, subapiculate, 
glabrous or slightly floccose beneath and on the margins, bright 
rather glaucous green above, more or less purple beneath ; flowering- 
shoots coming ofl" from axils of former leaves on the rootstocks, 
long-trailing, stout and succulent, compressed below, afterwards 
cylindrical ; leaves oblong, like those of barren shoot but smaller, 
all glabrous or nearly so, except at the nodes, which are slightly 
cob webbed or silky-floccose ; spikes sessile or shortly stalked, in 
clusters of 4 or 5 in axils of upper leaves ; bracts falcate, acute, 
much imbricated, nearly glabrous outside, but with floccose hair 



NOTES ON THE FLOEA OF CEYLON. 267 

round the flowers within ; sepals ovate, acuminate, transparent, 
villous with delicate cottony hair ; petals ovate-spathulate, obtuse, 
the broad claws coherent, the blades spreading, pale bright violet- 
blue ; stamens equal, very much exserted, erect ; upper half of 
filaments covered with long moniliform spreading blue hairs ; apex 
dilated into a flask-shaped bulb with an attenuated point bearing 
the minute anther ; ovary truncate, covered with erect silky hair ; 
style precisely like the filaments of the stamens, and similarly 
terminated by a pointed bulb ; seeds dark brown, the testa covered 
with very numerous minute prominences. 

Hab. On hot exposed rocks at Doluwe Kande, Kurunegala, 
and other low hills. A rather striking plant, not devoid of beauty; 
the leaves of the barren shoots are 9-10 in. long by 1:^ in. wide, 
the flowering- branches trail to a great distance, and are usually 
entirely coloured an intense deep red-purple. 

I had at first referred this to the widely- spread eastern species 
C. barhata Don, but afterwards named it C. ohtusa, sp. nov. I am. 
however, informed by Mr. Hemsley that it agrees with C. arach- 
noidea Clarke, under which I here place it. I have no authentic 
specimen of that species, which Mr. Clarke (Mon. Phan. in. 250) 
gives as a native of the Ceylon mountains as well as of Peninsular 
India. He also quotes for it Wight's figure of C. pilosa (Ic. t. 2083), 
which is very unlike my plant.* I have, however, kept it as a 
variety under C. araclmoiclea ; though from the type of this it differs 
considerably in its much larger size and much less wool, and in the 
filaments, like the style, being thickened at their summit into a 
bulk. The forms of this group are most difficult to limit satis- 
factorily. 

Phoenix zeylanica Trim. — FAate sylvestris Linn, (pro maxima 
parte). Plueidx sylvestris Thw. (non Eoxb.). — Stem erect, simple, 
rarely branched at the base, stout, reaching a height when full 
grown of 12, 14, or even more feet, but as usually seen much shorter, 
covered with the bases of the fallen leaves ; leaves rather short, 
the pinnte very numerous, not fasciculate, but nearly equally 
distant on the rachis, the lower ones reduced to strong sharp spines 
3-3^ in. long, the rest lanceolate-linear, the largest 7-10 in. long, 
conduplicate, very sharp-pointed, smooth, bright and shining, deep 
green, thick, rigid, distinctly 4-ranked, the ranks spreading nearly 
at right-angles, those pointing downwards set on obliquely with a 
twist at the base ; spathes sparingly covered with shaggy orange- 
coloured down. Female floAvers : — Calyx somewhat truncate, half 
the length of the petals, strongly 3-toothed, not ribbed; petals 
rotundate, each with 2 staminal rudiments at the base; fruit ^-f in. 
long, ovoid-oblong, apiculate, deep inky-purple when ripe, scarlet 
when half-ripe. 

Hab. This is the common wild Date Palm or " Indi " of the 
south and west parts of Ceylon (C. P. 3172), and has long been 

* I sent living plants of this to Kew in Sept. 1883; these have flowered there, 
and I am now informed that Prof. Oliver considers that ihcy may bo a form of 
G. arachnoidea Clarke, but do not correspond precisely witli anything in the Kew 
Herbarium. 



268 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

considered the same as the common and well-known wild Date of 
India, P. sylvestris Eoxb. It is, however, clearly distinguishable 
by its different habit, stouter trunk, shorter leaves, with more rigid, 
dark green, shining, non-fasciculate segments and black fruit. It 
is a common plant in Ceylon, but is not known in South India save 
in the Botanic Gardens. Tlie fruit has a scanty pulp, which is 
scarcely edible. Linnaeus's original Elate sylvestris (Sp. Plant, i. 
1189) was mainly based on this plant (= Fl. Zeylanica, n. 397), 
but he also quotes Kheede, ' Hort. Malab.,' iii., tt. 22-25, which is 
probably the common Indian species. Whether the other Ceylon 
Flucnuv, noted in a former part of this paper as P. imsilia Gaertn., 
is truly a distinct species may be open to doubt, but both it and 
P. zeylanica are quite different from the yellow-fruited P. sylvestris 
of India.* 

I have been accustomed for some years to call our Palm P. zey- 
lanica, and the name has also been published for it in the List of 
Palms cultivated at Kew, printed as an appendix to the Eeport of 
that establishment for 1882. Sir Joseph Hooker, who has made a 
careful study of the genus, is convinced of the distinctness of the 
Ceylon plant. 

Calamus nivalis Thw. ms. — Leaf-sheaths armed with copious 
large, straight, flat, yellow prickles, passing on the rachis beneath 
and at the sides into distant, solitary, recurved ones ; no terminal 
cirrhus ; rachis raised above, smooth ; segments numerous, closely 
placed, equidistant, broadly linear, tapering at both ends, with 3 
principal nerves and other intermediate ones, with a few distant 
scattered setae on the principal nerves beneath and at the apex ; 
spadix slender, elongated, set with hooked thorns, extended into a 
terminal thorny lorum, slightly branched; flowering branchlets 
usually short, numerous but not crowded, more or less stiffly 
recurved ; larger spathes prickly, smaller ones slightly so or 
smooth ; bracts ciliate ; male flowers crowded, with scanty fulvous 
scurf ; calyx cut half-way down ; petals and stamens raised on a 
stalk so that the former appear as long again as the calyx ; female 
flowers larger and less crowded ; corolla 3-toothed, fulvous- 
puberulous ; fruit f in. long, with a large point or beak, ovoid ; 
scales small, pale yellow, not channelled, tipped, and narrowly 
bordered with reddish brown. 

Hab. Pasdun Korle, Sept. 1864; Colombo, W. Ferguson fC. P. 
3914 in Herb. Perad.). Not a large species. Leaves about 3 ft. 
long, the longest segments about 9 or 10 ins., bright pale yellow- 
green. 

A near ally of C. tenuis Roxb., which differs in its general 
furfuraceous covering, smaller more distant and usually hermaphro- 
dite flowers on shorter branchlets, and nearly globular fruit with 
larger scales. I am indebted to Mr. W. Ferguson for fresh speci- 
mens in flower, collected about five miles from Colombo by the 
Koti Canal. 

* Tlie liuit of this is, when ripe, 1 in. long by ~ in. wide, and of a dull 
purplish orange, having passed through in ripening a bright oransfe-chronie 
yellow ; the pulp is more copious, with a sweet flavour quite similar to that of 
the cultivated date. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 269 

Calamus ovoideus Thw. ms. — Stem stout ; leaf-slieaths 
densely set with many close rings of broad, flat, often lacerate, 
deflexed black prickles ; racliis with deciduous down when young, 
concave above, the lateral ridges set with short sharp prickles, 
convex beneath, with distant solitary sharp rcflexed spines, 
becoming more numerous on the petiole, extending into a long 
cirrhus set with numerous closely-placed semicirclets of stout 
hooks ; leaflets equidistant, broadly linear, attenuate, many-nerved, 
the two principal ones (besides the midrib) with a few long weak 
setae on the upper surface ; apex bristly ; spadix branched, the 
lower spathes with stout deflexed hooks, the smaller ones smooth ; 
no lora ; flowers not seen ; fruit -^-^ in. long, oblong-ovoid, beaked, 
tapering slightly at base, which is supported by the much enlarged 
persistent perianth ; scales numerous, small, furrowed down the 
centre, pale greyish yellow, very narrowly edged with orange-brown. 

Hab. Safl'ragam District, Western Prov., 1866. (C. P. 3925 
in Hb. Perad.). Native name, " Tambutu-wel." A large species, 
a specimen of which is in the Botanic Garden ; leaves 14 ft. long 
or more, of which 4 ft. is occupied by the long tendril ; longest 
leaflets about 14 in. long, bright shining apple-green above, duller 
beneath. 

Judging from the fruit only, this species appears to be near C. 
acantliospathus Grifi'. (Palm. Brit. Ind. p. 50, t. cxc. A, 1), from 
Khasya, but the foliage of that plant is not described. 

Cryptocoryne Beckettii Thw. ms. — Petiole slender, from 
1^-3 times as long as the blade, sheathing at base ; blade lanceo- 
late-oblong, the base cordate or subauriculate, the apex subacute, 
entire, undulated, glabrous, minutely dotted above, 5-7-nerved, 
texture thin; spathe sessile, small; tube narrow, straight, glabrous, 
striate, scarcely contracted above the inflorescence ; blade small, 
not more than half as long as the tube, ending in a short tail ; 
stalk of male inflorescence shorter than it; female flowers (carpels) 
5 ; fruit not seen, 

Hab. Matale East, Feb. 1865, Mr. T. W. N. Beckett (C. P. 3868 
in Herb. Perad.). Kootstock small; petioles 4-8 in. long; leaf- 
blades 2^-4 in. ; spathe sessile, not an inch long. In some 
specimens (? submerged) the leaves are larger and narrower than 
above described, and less cordate. 

I have only herbarium specimens, and only one has an in- 
florescence, which is perhaps not fully matured. The species is 
apparently near C. cordata Grifi". (Ic. t. 172), from which it diti'ers 
in its narrower and differently-veined leaves, sessile inflorescence, 
and shorter spathe. 

Lagenandra insignis Trim. — Leaves with long petioles, the 
blade oblong-oval, acute at both ends, especially at apex, glabrous 
above, closely dotted beneath ; midrib beneath very thick and pro- 
minent, and with the numerous close lateral veins rough or woolly 
with short harsh scurfy hairs or papillfe ; spathe very large, the 
tube short, funnel-shaped, the limb many times longer, expanded, 
thin in texture, crisped and undulated, suddenly narrowed into a 
short tail, the upper part falling over (like an Arisicma), glabrous. 



270 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

" purple with white veins " ; inflorescence and fruit as in L. 
toxicaria, 

Hab. By water, Palewatu-Mukelane, Pasdun Korle, May, 1883. 
Leaves 12 in. long by 4 in. wide ; spathe fully 9 in. long. This 
was brought in by the native plant-collectors already half-dried ; 
the spathes dyed the drying-paper deep purple. Boots were also 
brought for the garden, but have not yet flowered here. 

Near the very common L. toxicaria Dalz. (= Arum ovatuni L.), 
but very distinct by the large purple drooping spathe ; the leaves 
are also well characterised by the peculiar indumentum of the veins 
beneath. This adds a fifth species to this genus, all of which are 
natives of Ceylon, and four of them endemic here. 

Eriocaulon fluviatile Trim. — Submerged ; rhizome creeping, 
slender, flexuous, ascending at the end, attaining several inches in 
length, and emitting copious long roots ; leaves about 4 to 8, very 
long (8 to 10 in.), not closely inserted, very narrow (scarcely ^\ in. 
wide), solid, compressed (oval or section), channelled along one 
face, flaccid, dark green, shining, gradually dilated at base into a 
membranous sheath lined with a cottony wool ; scape solitary, 
ai^parently terminal, rather shorter than the leaves, erect, stiff, 
slender, cylindrical ; basal sheath about h^ in. long, loose but not 
dilated, smooth, thin, split down one side from the top for a short 
distance, free portion acute ; heads small (about J in. diam.), 
depressed-globular ; involucral scales short, roundish-oval, entire, 
very obtuse, smooth, brown, floral ones linear-oblong, with coarse 
white hairs on the upper part ; flowers apparently dioecious, minute, 
densely crowded on the semiglobular receptacle ; female flowers 
with sepals and petals spathulate-linear, the latter narrower, 
pellucid, with scanty white hairs at top ; style deeply 3-cleft ; 
seeds smooth, pale orange ; male flowers not seen. 

Hab. Plentiful in a quick-flowing stream (the Kappara-ela) now 
flowing into the reservoir at Labugama, West Prov., Jan. 1885; in 
company with Mr. AV. Ferguson. The plant is entirely submerged in 
the rapid current, only the heads of flowers being elevated above the 
surface ; it is abundant in the smaller tributaries, as well as the 
Kappara-ela main stream. Mr. Ferguson had previously sent me 
specimens of this curious species collected in or near the same 
place in 1882, on the occasion of the Elephant Kraal held there in 
that year. I also think that specimens in the Herbarium here (of 
leaves only) under C. P. 3057, labelled "Galle and Hewesse," may 
be the same plant. 

The only Indian species which seems to be allied at all closely 
to this is E. DalzeUii Koern. {E. rivulare Dalz.), from Western 
India. But this, as described in Kew Journ. Bot. iii. p. 280, has 
the stem densely leafy, the leaves flat, 1 line broad, 7 -nerved and 
much shorter, the scapes umbellate-congested and only twice as 
long as the leaves, and the involucral bracts lacerate. 

IsACHNE ATjSTRALis E. Br., var. EFFUSA Trim. — Differs from the 
type, as seen in Ceylon, in its larger size, much broader, more 
compound panicle 3-5 in. long, with the branches more horizontal 
and the flowers on longer pedicels, and quite glabrous glumes. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 271 

Hab. Streams about Peradeniya, Central Prov., flowering in 
January. The stems root at the lower nodes. A much more 
diffuse growing plant than the ordinary form of the species here. 

The empty glumes are certainly not persistent below the 
articulations in this plant, but fall with the spikelet or immediately 
after, leaving the bare much-dilated apex of the pedicel very con- 
apicuous, as in so many species of PanicerE. 

I. meneritana Poir. is merely /. aiistralis type. The name was 
(Encycl. Method. Suppl. iii. 185) bestowed on the Ceylon plant 
mentioned by Brown when he published the genus Isachne as being 
a member of it (Prod. Fl. Nov. Holl. j). 196). The specimen is in 
Hermann's herbarium, and is alluded to by Linnaeus in ' Flora 
Zeylanica' under No. 43. Mr. Ridley, of the British Museum, has 
kindly examined the original, and informs me that it is precisely 
C. P. 880 (i.e., /. aiistralis). The Sinhalese name " Meneri-tana" 
(tana = grass) is, however, erroneously applied to this by Hermann ; 
it rightly belongs to two species of Fanicum — P. iiiiliare and P. 
psilopodinm — which are commonly cultivated as dry grains in the 
low country. 

Panicum reticulatum Thw. ms. — A large, erect, perennial 
grass, 3-6 ft. or more in height ; leaf-sheaths strongly hispid with 
bristly hairs ; nodes silky ; blade linear, rather long, somewhat 
hispid beneath near the base; ligule short, erect, jagged-ciliate ; 
panicle very large and compound, the branches long, erect or 
ascending, the lower in tufts not verticillate, all flexuous and 
rough ; spikelets rather scattered and distant, on slender pedicels, 
under ^ in. long, acuminate, glabrous ; outer glume subacute, not 
half the length of the spikelet, broad, 5-nerved, somewhat gibbous; 
2nd and 3rd glumes subequal, very concave, apiculate, with a hard 
tip, 7-9-nerved, all three similar in texture, membranous, olive- or 
purplish-green, the parallel nerves connected mostly in the upper 
part by 2-4 short transverse ones forming a loose reticulation, the 
3rd glume with a rather large empty membranous palea in its axil ; 
flowering-glume not much shorter, smooth and shining ; grain 
plano-convex, hard, smooth and polished, bright ochre-yellow. 

Hab. Borders of paddy-fields, Hewessee, Pasdun Korle, Aug. 
1865 (C. P. 3890 in Herb. Perad.) ; Culloden Estate, near Kalutara, 
1881, W. Fenjusun. A large handsome species, attaining a great 
size, and with very hispid sheaths when grown in a garden at 
Colombo. The arrangement of the spikelets and branching of the 
panicle is somewhat similar to those of the universally cultivated 
"Guinea Grass," F. maxivmm L., to which indeed the present 
species is allied. 

I am informed by Mr. Hemsley that this species is also in 
Herb. Kew from Malacca (Grifiith) and from the Philippines 
(Cuming 652 & 1667). The latter specimens are named by Ben- 
tham and Munro "P. cccsium Hk. & Arn. ex Nees"; but Mr. 
Hemsley points out that they are quite distinct fi'om the Macao 
plant so named by Hk. & Arn. in Bot. Beechey's Voy. p. 235, 
which is clearly a species of the Fchinochloa group. Steudel has 
copied their description (Syn. p. 47) under "P. cccsium Nees (in pt.)," 



272 NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 

and the locality given for this is "Ceylon." Under these circum- 
stances I believe our plant to require a name, and I now leave it 
under Thwaites' very appropriate appellation, though in the list of 
additional C. P. numbers at the commencement of this paper I have 
given it as P. cashmi Nees. 

Panicum. blephariphyllum Trim. — Leaf-sheaths smooth or 
the upper ones with scattered spreading bristly hairs ; ligule 
obsolete ; blade broadly linear, gradually tapering to apex, broad 
semi-amplexicaul and auricled at the base, closely veined, thin, flat, 
glabrous on both sides, the margin furnished with long, fine, 
straight, spreading, stiff cilia from small bulbous bases ; panicle 
long-stalked, 8-10 in. long; branches solitary or two together, 
scattered, ascending, rough, slightly branched, with a tuft of long 
hairs at base ; spikelets stalked, solitary, about |- in. long ; lowest 
glume more than three-fourths the length of the spikelet, strongly 
apiculate, broad, normally 3-nerved, the nerves strongly scabrous ; 
2nd glume acuminate-cuspidate, with central midrib and a pair of 
closely-placed nerves on either side, smooth ; 3rd glume rather 
shorter, acute, similarly veined, with a male flower in axil ; 
flowering-glume about half the length of 3rd, obtuse, thick. 

Hab. Euanwelle, Western Prov., Nov. 1883, Mr. W. Ferguson. 

Very near P. Leptochloa Nees (C. P. 918), especially in the 
spikelets, which scarcely differ save in being rather longer and less 
crowded, and with somewhat broader glumes. Both belong to that 
group of Panicum in which the lowest glume approaches the others 
in length. P. Leptochloa is, however, a more slender grass ; and 
its leaves are narrow and rigid, and not or but very slightly dilated 
at the base ; nor have they the marked ciliation of the margin. 

I notice that the lowest glume is very frequently 4-nerved, and 
then somewhat unsymmetrical. 

Dimeria laxiuscula Thw. ms. — Perennial, tufted ; stems 
erect, rather slender, 2-3 ft. high, scarcely branched ; nodes with a 
thick tuft of white silky hair ; leaf- sheaths smooth in lower, hairy 
in upper part ; blade narrow, linear, erect, strongly keeled, more or 
less hairy on both sides, and long-ciliate on margin ; ligule short, 
truncate ; spikes 5-10, 3-4 in. long, slender ; spikelets small, 
shortly stalked, each with a short tuft of silky hair at the base, 
much flattened ; lowest glume linear, very acute, strongly con- 
duplicate, with loug cilia on the keel below ; 2nd glume longer, 
almost aristate, with hyaline margins, glabrous but for a few long 
hairs on the back above ; 3rd glume much shorter, hyaline and 
transparent ; terminal glume hyaline, deeply bifid, and with a bent 
arm four times its length ; stamens 2. 

Hab. Pasdun Korle, Sept. 1864 (C. P. 3863 in Herb. Perad.) ; 
Kulutara, Dec. 1882. 

Near D. jnlodssiwa Trim. [Haplachne Presl). but with a stricter 
habit, narrower leaves, and smaller and laxer spikelets with a 
shorter tuft at the base ; the glumes are much more compressed 
and glabrous, and the two lower more unequal. I have, however, 
recently found at Labugama a form of D. piUmssima (var. glabra 
Trim. ) with the glumes quite as glabrous as those of D. laxiuscula. 



NOTES ON THE FLORA OF CEYLON. 273 

The name of this species has ah-eady been published, without 
description, in W. Ferguson's 'Grasses of Ceylon,' in Journ. Roy. 
Asiatic Soc. (Ceylon Branch) for 1880, p. 38. M. Hackel agrees in 
considering it a distinct species. 

Teinostachyum P maculatum Trim. — Densely tufted ; 
rhizome much and intricately branched, the short curved branches 
clothed with thin yellow or brown scales ; culms closely placed, 
attaining about 25 ft. in height, slender, the largest seen about 
f in. in diameter and many not half that size, stiff but not very 
strong, surrounded at base by a few papery sheaths ; joints 15-20 in. 
long, smooth, polished and shining in the loAver part, the upper 
part of each harsh with minute closely-adpressed silvery scurf-like 
hairs, greyish green, elegantly mottled with irregular rings, bands, 
lores, and blotches of dark purplish claret- col our, subpersistent ; 
leaf sheaths ("spathes") 4 or 5 in. long, very closely adpressed to 
the stem, truncate, smooth, yellow ; rudimentary leaf-blade linear, 
acuminate, deflexed ; branchlets densely tufted ; leaves lanceolate- 
oblong, 6-8 in. long by 1-1:|- in. wide, very shortly petiolate, 
suddenly rounded at the base, unequal-sided, tapering into a long 
filiform apex, the margins rough with minute forward-pointing 
prickles, smooth on both surfaces, closely veined, with no cross- 
veinlets, bright apple-green above, purplish glaucous beneath ; 
sheaths lax, striate, smooth, auricled at top, the auricles angular 
and provided with a few long filiform deciduous appendages ; 
flowers not seen. 

Hab. Forming jungle in several places in the districts of 
Ambagamua, Ruanwelle, and regions to the south-west of Adam's 
Peak. The specimens described were collected on Galbodde Tea 
Estate, Ambagamua, Dec. 1883, by Mr. C. J. Ferguson. A gre- 
garious bamboo, the slender stems rising erect for 8 or 10 ft. and 
then commencing to di'oop, the straggling upper branches requiring 
support and becoming subscandent, as is the case with many other 
small bamboos, e.g., Anindinaria debilis and Teinostaclujum attenu- 
atum. In the absence of flowers and fruit it is of course impossible 
to refer this with good reasons to any established geims. The 
native name is "Rama Batali," the latter word being the name of 
the very common Ochlanclra stridula, the small bamboo which 
covers hundreds of square miles of country in the south and west 
of Ceylon. 

The history of the detection of this very pretty species here is 
rather curious. It resulted from the exhibition, at a show held by 
the Agri-horticultural Society of Colombo, in August, 1883, of some 
light furniture, boxes, &c., cased with the mottled stems split and 
varnished. I at once recognised these as distinct from any recorded 
species in Ceylon, and on enquiring of the native gentleman, Mr. 
P. de Saram, exhibiting them, was inform d of its Sinhalese name, 
and that it was not uncommon on the southern slopes of the 
Adam's Peak Mountains. Mr. W. Ferguson afterwards learnt that 
it also grew near Ruanwelle, and on a visit thither in November 
was able to confirm the report. It has since been collected in 
other places ui the same climatic district of Ceylon, and plants are 
Journal of iioiANY. — Vol. 23. [JSkpt., lb8o.j 



274 PLANTS OF EAST GLOUCKSTER AND NORTH WILTS. 

now growing in the Botanic Gardens. It is indeed remarkable that 
so characteristic a bamboo, and one so well known to the natives, 
should have remn-'ied quite unnoticed by the numerous collectors 
and botanists who have been over the country during the past fifty 
years. 

It is much to be hoped that flowering specimens may be 
obtained, as it may not improbably form a new genus of Bambusem. 

Trichomanes Wallii Thw. ms. — Fronds simple, ^ to nearly 
t in. long, mostly broad-ovate, with a cordate base and very obtuse 
apex ; margin minutely and distantly denticulate ; venation sub- 
radiate, the midrib being distinct, but lost before reaching the apex 
of the frond ; no spurious venules ; involucres solitary, terminal, 
not placed in a sinus, and not or very slightly exserted beyond the 
margin of the frond ; border of mouth flat, spreading, entire. 

Hab. Stones and tree-trunks in the stream running through 
the Labugama Elephant Kraal, March, 1870, collected with masses 
of T. muscoides by Mr. W. Ferguson (C. P. 3989 in Herb. Perad.). 
Khizome very slender ; fronds not crowded, subsessile. 

Very near T. Motley i V. de B., and perhaps not more than a 
variety of it, but distinguishable by the sunken not exserted 
involucres. The shape of the fronds varies ; the ones bearing fruit 
are less cordate, or even tapering at the base. 

The name T. Wallii Thw. has been published in Mr. W. 
Ferguson's pamphlet, 'Ceylon Ferns' (Colombo, 1880), preface, 
and in Mr. G. Wall's ' Check List.' It is not mentioned in Col. 
Beddome's 'Handbook' (1883).

In July last I made a special search for Car ex tomentosa in the

A meadow at Marston showed Blysmus cornpressus as one of the 
commonest ingredients in its vegetation, Iris acoriformis is the 
common Iris of the Upper Thames, and, judging from immature 
specimens, negleetum is the common Sparganiuvi. Bromus raccmosus 
is a frequent meadow-grass. 

Rosa mollis is common above Bampton, in Oxon, and stretches 
into both Wilts and Gloucester, as above stated. On the stiff 
Oxford Clay at Bampton R. canina seemed very variable, as it does 
on Otmoor, in Oxon, and as there the Faihi were almost confined to 
R. discolor and R. corylifolius. 

A Festuea form from Marston and Lechlade, and also from 
Oxon, is worth further study; it is the same form as the one 
gathered on Brean Down by Dillenius, and referred to in the 
' Eichardson Correspondence.'

A CLASSIFICATION OF GAEDEN EOSES. 

By J. G. Baker, F.E.S.* 

A GOOD general monograph of the genus Rosa is needed. 
Lindley's 'Monograph' was published in the year 1820, and since 
then a great number of new species have been discovered, and a 
very large number of books and papers have been written bearing 
upon the subject in one way or another. The difficulty which one 
finds at the outset in using Lindley's book is that his primary 
groups are characterised so briefly, and that the points of contrast 
which they present are not fully and clearly brought out into view. 
The following key shows the best way of getting over these diffi- 
culties which, after having had a large number of specimens 
through my hands during the last thirty years, I am able to 
suggest. The list of species is only intended to be exhaustive so 
far as garden roses are concerned, with the addition of a few well- 
marked types not yet brought into cultivation. What I have aimed

282 A CLASSIFICATION OF GARDEN ROSES, 

at is to give a separate number to well-marked types only, and to 
place under these the subspecies and varieties into which they 
deviate. Of course I am well aware that in liusa, of all genera, 
even if independent observers work from the same standing-point, 
it is not in the least likely that any two of them will draw the line 
between species and subspecies in the same way. What follows 
must therefore be taken as a rough draft of a very condensed guide 
to the determination and classification of the garden types.

TWO NEW BRITISH PLANTS. 

By H. N. Ridley, M.A., F.L.S. 

(Plates 261, 262.) 

The persevering efforts of our British botanists in the North 
have again been rewarded by the discovery of two S2)ecies of 
Cyperacea not hitherto recognised as belonging to our flora. Tliese 
are ScJuenus fernujineus L., obtained by Mr. James Brebner in 
Perthshire, and Carex salina var. kattegatensis Fries, found by Mr. 
J. Grant in Caithness. 

Of the genus ScJmnus only two species occur in the North 
Temperate Zone, viz., S. nigricans L. and S. femtgineus L., the 
bulk of the species, upwards of sixty in niimber, being natives 
of Australia and New Zealand. The first-named species has 
the widest range of any in the genus, extending from Sinai to 
Western North America, and occurring also in the Cape of Good 
Hope. Sclucnus ferrugineus is of a much more limited distribution, 
being entirely confined to Europe, and by no means universally 
distributed even there. It is found, however, sparingly over the 
whole continent from Scandinavia to South Russia, excluding the 
extreme north and south, being apparently absent from the Spanish 
Peninsula, Italy, and France, with the exception of the Jura. Its 
habitat, like that of the other species, seems to be open peaty 
moors, often, especially in Southern Europe, at a considerable 
altitude.

Carex salina Walilenberg. — This is a peculiarly interesting 
addition to our flora, on account of its distribution. The whole of 
the section to which it belongs, the Maritwm of Nyman, are plants 
very characteristic of Arctic sea-shores, descending a little further 
south here and there along the coasts or on the mountains in the 
colder parts of Europe and North America. C. salina Walil. is 
perhaps the commonest of the section, and is a very variable plant, 
on account of which it has received a very extensive synonymy. 
Boott. (Illustr. Car. iv. 160) classified the varieties and divided 
them into the tall typical form, and the variety minor, including all 
the smaller forms with narrower and slenderer leaves and culms, 
and fewer often sessile spikelets ; but he remarks that the two 
vai'ieties pass gradually into each other. Besides varying in these 
points, there is great variation in the length and scabridity of the 
mucro in the female glumes, whence arose Wahlenberg's vars. 
cuspidatd Sind nuitica ; also in the number of stigmas, some speci- 
mens having two and some three, and in the colour of the glumes. 
In the very reduced forms, subspathacea, reducta, &c., the glumes 
are quite pale-coloured, as is often the case in high Arctic 
glumaceous plants ; while in some of the taller forms from further 
south, e.<i., Massachusetts, the southern parts of Scandinavia, and 
the Caithness locality, the glumes are very dark in colour, forming 
the varieties luematolepis, hdttegatensis, &c.

NOTES ON THE INOCULATION OF FISHES WITH 
SAPROLEGNIA FERAX* 

The following notes are extracts from Keports made from time 
to time by Mr. G. Murray to Prof. Huxley. They have special 
reference to the trausmissibility of the disease : — 

I. 

" On February 2nd, 1882, I received from Prof. Huxley several 
flies covered with Saproleynia ferax, which had been obtained by 
him from a diseased Conway salmon in the previous December. 
The cultivation of this fungus was continued, and four inoculations 
were made with it on Sulnio ferox during July, but without success. 

" Oogonia and oospores were found in the cultivations for the 
first time on January 31st, 1883, very nearly a year from the time 
I obtained it, and after fourteen months of cultivation, during 
which period a constant and almost daily watch had been kept on it. 

" With this fungus, of which the zoosporangia and oospores 
were plentifully ripe, I attempted the inoculation of two healthy 
specimens of Salmo ferox (February 1st) and two healthy dace

(February 19th), by rubbing the top of the fish's head with a fly on 
which the fungus was growing. In the case of one Sahno ferox a 
very shght abrasion of the epidermis over the region referred to had 
been previously made by gently rubbing it with fine sand. 

" Again no result followed these experiments, and on March 2nd 
they were repeated on the same two dace, this time by rubbing 
(without previous abrasion) the left side of the fish midway between 
the gills and the tail-fin. The change in the region rubbed was 
made in consequence of the observation that on nearly all the 
diseased dace I had seen the part named was commonly the first 
affected, the right side equally with left. On March 5th each of 
these fish had a small tuft of what was afterwards found to be 
SaproU'i/nid fera.v growing on the region of inoculation, and by 
March lOtli it had grown to a large patch. On this day one of the 
fisii escaped from the water, and when found was lying dead close 
to the vessel in which it had been confined. It then bore a similar 
appearance to the other, as regards the progress of the disease. 
The other died on March 16th, its body being nearly covered with 
a luxuriant growth of Saprolenniaferax, the oospores of which were 
present, but sparingly. 

" Of the eight unsuccessful experiments half had been made 
before the appearance, and half in the presence, of oospores. 
Since, however, none had been successfully made in the absence of 
oospores, I determined to enquire if that affected the possibility of 
infection. Two healthy dace were therefore rubbed, on March 26th, 
over the same region as in the successful cases, with Saprolegnia 
ferax, on which neither oogonium nor oospore could be found, the 
zoosporangia being plentiful, however, and numerously ripe. In 
both cases the experiment was successful, and indeed the activity 
of the disease appeared to be greater from the fact that one fish 
succumbed in ten days and the other in fourteen. 

" In the case of the fish which died on the tenth day the body 
was nearly covered with the fungus, but in the case of the other 
which died on the fourteenth day the disease was confined to one 
side, extending from the mouth over the gills down to the tail-fin, 
both sides of which, however, were badly affected. 

" On both fishes, contrary to my expectation, oospores were 
more numerous than on those individuals which had been inoculated 
with oospore-bearing material." 

II. 

" In continuation of the inoculation experiments with Sapro- 
ler/nid fenix made last year on the dace, I have begun a fresh series 
this time on fishes belonging to the Salnionidcc, and the results are 
briefly as follows: — 

"The agent used in all the inoculations was Saprolet/niti fcrax, 
directly continued by cultivation from the fungus obtained by Prof. 
Huxley in December, 1881, from a diseased Conway salmon. These 
cultivations have been maintained since then on the fly, and 
observed almost daily. The fungus of this stock, if it may be so 
termed, was used last year in the inoculation experiments on the

dace, and it has at different times been observed to grow freely on 
pieces of bladder, young cockroaches, and a variety of other hosts. 
In the autumn of last year oospores were formed on it within a 
week of their corresponding appearance in the previous year,* — 
and this year they were first detected on January 29th, two days 
before their first occurrence last year. 

" The first inoculation experiment of the present series was 
begun on February 1st, when oospores were few in number. The 
fish was a healthy Salmo fario, and the inoculation was made (as 
in all following cases) by rubbing several Hies bearing the fungus 
on the top of the fish's head without any abrasion of the epidermis. 
The disease was first observed on the fourth day in the form of a 
patch of numerous short filaments on the region rubbed. From 
this it extended gradually, and the fish (as in all other cases 
described here) showed symptoms of irritation, followed after a 
time by languid movements, and finally died on the fourteenth day 
after inoculation, February 15th. On February 12th another 
inoculation was made, the conditions being precisely the same as 
the last, except in this respect — that the fungus used bore many 
oospores, but very few ripe zoosporangia. No appearance of 
successful inoculation followed, and on the 20fch, after I had given 
up all hope of any result, I went to Scotland for a fortnight, leaving 
the fish in an apparently healthy state. Eeturning on March 6th, 
I was surprised to find it extensively diseased, and in fact dying. 
It died on the following day — three weeks and two days after 
inoculation. A few oospores were found on the fungus growing on 
the fish, as sometimes occurs in other cases. I may venture to put 
forward here a supposition, which seems to me to throw light on 
this case. The material used was, as already mentioned, rich in 
oospores, but bearing few ripe zoosporangia. I have frequently 
observed oospores germinate in ' hanging drop ' cultivations after a 
period of about a fortnight. Supposing this inoculation was effected 
by the product of oospores germinating after such a period, the 
remaining time was sufficient for the development of the fungus to 
the condition observed on my return. Most unfortunately, and to 
my great regret, I left no arrangements for having the fish watched 
and its appearance noted, as I had quite given up hope of result 
from the experiment, and in the absence of evidence this supposition 
is ventured. 

"At an early period of the late Fisheries Exhibition a consider- 
able number of fish died in the aquarium from the disease, and this 
was coincident with the presence of much lime in the water from 
the newly-constructed artificial rockwork. To determine the part 
played, if any, by lime in the water in cases of disease, Prof. Huxley 
suggested to me certain experiments, of which the following is the 
result : — 

" On March 7th two healthy S. fario were inoculated in the 
manner just described. In both cases the disease appeared on the 
third day, progressed in the fashion described, and the fishes died, 

* In a cultivation of different origin. 



NOTES ON INOCULATION OF FISHES WITH SAPROLEGNIA FERAX. 305 

the one on the twelfth day, the other on the fifteenth day, after 
inoculation. At the same time the experiment was extended to two 
other healthy S. J'ario, and the only difference made was that, in 
the latter case, the fishes were supplied with water containing about 
half per cent, of lime-water added. Here, again, the disease 
appeared on the third day on both fishes, but on the eighth day 
they died, not so extensively diseased as those in ordinary water — 
the fungus infesting them being in amount almost equal to that on 
the fishes of the corresponding experiment after the same period of 
time. They died soon after the beginning of what may be called 
the time of languid movements. Before these inoculations were 
made newly-killed flies were rubbed on the mucous coating of all 
the fish, and these flies were then placed in cultivation by them- 
selves, some in ordinary water and others in the water containing 
lime from the supply-cistern. On none of these flies did Suprulcgnia 
appear, but in a few days they were covered with a common mould 
— just as has happened in all my attempts to obtain Suprolegnia by 
simply placing flies in water (whether ordinary water or water con- 
taining lime), though this method has succeeded in the hands of 
many other observers in other places. 

" A fresh attempt was then made on March 15tli with a more 
convenient arrangement of tanks, the subject of experiment this 
time being young salmon hatched in the Fisheries Exhibition. 
These fish were, or rather, I should say, are — since they are still 
alive, except one — parr, beginning to lose their spots. They were 
all perfectly healthy in appearance. Three of them were placed in 
each of the four tanks — two tanks supplied with ordinary water, 
and two with water containing lime, this time about \ per cent. 
The three in one tank fi-om each of the pairs of tanks were 
inoculated, the two other tanks remaining untouched as check 
experiments (in all cases a similar arrangement has been made) ; 
and, after a slight appearance of the fungus on inoculated fishes 
living inider both conditions, the promise of success was not 
fulfilled, and by March 20tli they were all apparently healthy again. 
Similar cultivation experiments with flies rubbed as before on the 
fish previous to inoculation were made, and again there was no 
result. On March 20th the whole of the experiment of the 15th 
was repeated on the same fishes. The slight appearance of the 
disease followed as before, gradually diminishing, and has dis- 
appeared except in three cases — two in ordinary water and one in 
water containing lime. One of these fishes I have killed, and 
examination shows a slight development of the fungus, more in 
the epidermis than externally ; and the others remain, giving some 
promise of success. A negative result was again obtained with the 
flies rubbed before inoculation. 

" I should state that in all successful cases the disease has first 
appeared on the region of inoculation, and from there it has spread 
not always continuously ; sometimes an outbreak has occurred on 
a new place, most frequently on the tail. The time from inocula- 
tion to death corresi^onds with the periods in the cases of inoculated 
dace. The temperature variations afl'ect the cultivations so slightly

(except, of course, extreme beat and cold) that I am not at present 
disposed to attach much value to their influence in cases of in- 
oculation, and certainly nothing has yet been observed of any value 
in this direction. The water containing lime was prepared in a 
cistern from which a supply-pipe led to two tanks bifurcating, and 
thus serving each from the same source. 

" These experiments at least furnish starting-points for fresh 
experiments, from which it is to be hoped some light may be 
obtained as to the influence of the presence of lime." 

III. 

' ' During the latter part ot spring and the early summer of last 
year a considerable number of the fish inhabiting the tanks in the 
Fish Culture Museum suffered from the attacks of Saprole<jnia. 
The young salmon, which had been hatched in the Fisheries 
Exhibition and reared in the Fish Culture Museum, sufl^ered most, 
and nearly all of those attacked died. This outbreak was entirely 
unexpected, and, considering the circumstances under which it 
took place, its origin was at first inexplicable. The water in which 
the fish in question were living came from the same source as that 
which had a great number of times undergone the test of immersing 
flies in it without these showing a sign of the growth of Sapro- 
legnia. I applied this test again to water taken before it entered 
the tanks, and the supply remained as pure as before ; while, as 
would be expected, water from the tanks themselves yielded Sapro- 
legnia readily. It was thus made certain that the disease was not 
conveyed to the fish through the water supply, and the next 
direction enquiry took was to ascertain if by any means the disease 
had been communicated to these fish from those in adjoining tanks, 
which were the subject of inoculation experiment. Careful enquiry 
brought no result. The experiments were being conducted in an 
isolated manner, and the landing-nets, &c., used in the capture and 
handling of diseased fish had never been employed in other tanks. 
In my difficulties Prof. Huxley, foreseeing that the result of such 
an enquiry could not fail to be instructive, encouraged me to 
prosecute it, and suggested that the food given to the fish might 
be the vehicle of the infectious material. A consideration of this 
enabled us to pitch upon the earthworms used for this purpose as 
most likely to yield result. Several of these were intercepted 
while being conveyed to the tanks for food, and were placed under 
cultivation. After the lapse of two days the Sajyrolegnia un- 
mistakably showed itself, and, though comparison satisfied me of 
the identity of this fungus with that of the disease, the matter was 
put to absolute proof by using this fungus as the agent of inocula- 
tion in the final successful experiment recorded last year. Exami- 
nation disclosed the presence (in two cases) of oospores in the 
earthy contents of the worms, and these, I believe, were the 
oospores of Saprolcgnia. I never succeeded in finding any worm at 
large on which the Saprolcgnia was growing, and, though the 
ground was damp, I was sufficiently surprised to find alive even 
the resting- state of this purely aquatic fungus, since desiccation at

an ordinary temperature soon kills it. The fact that I ceased to 
find worms bearing Saprolegnla as the summer advanced I attribute 
to the great dryness which resulted from the exceptionally hot 
weather. 

" The immediate cause of the outbreak having been thus 
ascertained, the grave question remained, — where did the earth- 
worms obtain the SaproUytda ? I procured worms from various 
parts of the country, including the neighbourhood of a river [the 
Tweed] which contained diseased fish, and on none of these could 
Saprolegnia be reared without inoculation. I continued to find it 
on earthworms — though not on all — procured from a piece of waste 
ground adjoining the Fish Culture Museum, and it soon became 
notable that worms only from a certain region (a few yards in 
diameter) of this ground yielded the fungus. It could never be 
found on those dug up in the adjacent grounds of the Natural 
History Museum. Now, over the particular region indicated there 
were lying a number of fish-bones, which at once aroused curiosity. 
The remarkable results obtained by M. Pasteur in his observations 
on earthworms as carriers of infectious material suggested a clue 
to the way out of the difficulty, though I was unwilling to believe, 
as 1 am now, that this aquatic fungus could maintain life for any 
length of time in the ground. However, the discovery that the 
bones just mentioned belonged to certain fish which had died in the 
tanks erected by the Fisheries Exhibition Commissioners, and had 
been so cast out there a few months before, seemed to point in the 
direction which my suspicions took. Mr. Edon (to whom I am 
much indebted for assistance throughout this enquiry) informed 
me, however, that to the best of his knowledge worms for food 
were never dug up in that particular place, and its appearance bore 
out his belief. Matters remamed for some time in this unsatisfactory 
position, until, in going over the ground one day, I observed a 
labourer digging in the very region which had been infected. On 
questioning him he succeeded in remembering having once or twice 
in rainy weather earlier in the year obtained his worms from there. 
(It was near shelter.) The agreement thus established forces upon 
me the conclusion that the infectious material was obtained from 
the dead fish cast out, — that during the damp weather it remained 
alive in its resting-state, and was spread abroad in the ground by 
earthworms, and that it was finally conveyed by them into the 
tanks where the outbreak took place. Later in the year, as 
described, this source of infection was dried up, while the outbreak 
was stopped by the precautions Mr. Edon took in his treatment of 
the fish. 

" Towards the end of November a species of Bictyuclnis hitherto 
unknown to me began to appear along with the Saprulci/nia in the 
cultivations. It rapidly increased in power, and in the course of a 
few days obtained complete possession ; and the Sajirolc<i)tia, which 
had first been placed in cultivation three years before (all but a few 
days) by Prof. Huxley entirely disappeared. The suddenness and 
completeness with which it was driven from the field were highly 
impressive, as well as not a little annoying after a period of

attention to it of so long duration. However, the circumstance 
had its signiticance, in exhibiting the existence of a powerful 
competition with the Saproliujnia. Whence did it come ? "What 
influence does it exert at large on this disease of fishes m thus 
driving it from its stronghold in the bodies of insects, &c., in 
water ? Especially, what is its action on the skin of fishes ?" 



HEPATIC M OF SUFFOLK. 
By the Eev. E. N. Bloomfield, M.A. 

In common with several other counties in the East of England, 
Sufiblk has no hills worthy of the name, the air is dry, and the 
rainfall but scanty. Hence we need not be suriarised that this 
family is represented by few species, and even these occur but 
sparingly. 

The only common species are Fndlania dilatata and Radula 
complanata, on trees ; Marchantia polyviorpha, C'onocephalus conicus, 
and Fellia epiplujUa, on sides of streams, &c. ; and Lophocolea 
hidentata, in shady places. Even the usually common Dipluphyllum 
albicans has not yet been met with in Sufl'olk.

of the ' London Catalogue of British Mosses and Hepaticas,' ed. ii.

ON A NEW SPECIES OF GUSSONEA. 
By H. N. Kidley, M.A., F.L.S. 

Among the plants recently collected by M. Leon Humblot in the 
Comoro Islands occurs a species of this genus, which appears as 
yet to be undescribed. The genus is typically characteristic of the 
East African archipelago, occurring also on the mainland. It is 
remarkable for its copious and long roots, absence of leaves, 
excepting for a few sheaths upon the stem, and minute flowers. 
The present species, in its long slender stem and very small flowers, 
approaches G. ciphyUa Eich., but the spur is cylindrical, tapering 
gradually to a point, which, with the narrow petals, distinguish it 
clearly from the rest of the genus. The roots are slightly flattened, 
somewhat rough, and fewer than in G. exilis Eidl.

I gathered specimens of a Carcx, which experts pronounce to bo 
Carex ustuJata, reported by Don from Ben Lawers in 1810. It has 
apparently not been found since, and is therefore characterised in 
the appendix to Hooker's Flora as " one of Don's reputed dis- 
coveries." Scotch botanists are highly gratified by this con- 
firmation of Don's trustworthiness. — James Beebner. 

PiNGUicuLA ALPiNA IN SuTHERLANDSHiRE. — In the late summcr of 
1884 Mr. W. J. Ball, of Harrow, gathered Pimjuicula aljiina near 
the sea, at no great elevation, in the Loch Inver district of 
Sutherlandshire. This I believe to be a new county record. — 
E. S. Marshall. 

Suffolk Mosses. — The Kev. E. N. Bloomfield's list of Suffolk 
Mosses (Journ. Bot. 1885, 238) prompts me to send a list of a few 
which I found during a recent stay in the east of the county, and 
which are additions to that list, either as being new to the county 
or to the vice-county formed by the eastern half. 

Species new to the county : — SphcKjnum cymUfolium var. sqiuir- 
rosulum Nees, Lound; Cumpijlopus Jiexuosus Brid., Walberswick ; 
C. paradoxus Wils., Walberswick ; C. fragilis B. & S., Lound; 
Barbula marginata B. & S., Blythburgh ; B. i>apillosa Wils., Wren- 
tham ; Orthotriclmm tenellum Bruch., Wrentham ; Eurhijnchium 
pumilum Wils., Lound. 

Species new to the vice-county : — Plaffiotheciiua ^indulatum L., 
Fritton Water ; Barbula intermedia Brid., Blythburgh ; Orthotrichum 
saxatile Brid., Burgh Castle. — H. N. Dixon. 

Polygonum maritimum in S. Devon.  - Having recently been 
staying for a week or two in South Devon, I had the good fortune 
to find Polygonum maritiiimm growing near Dawlish beside P. Pali, 
Salsola Kali, and other commoner seashore plants. My friend Mr. 
H. T. Mennell drew my attention to its rarity (it has been recorded 
for North Devon, but not, I think, before for South Devon), and 
he, as well as Mr. Arthur Bennett and Mr. Archer Briggs, who 
have seen the specimens, agree that they are true P. maritimum. — 
W. F. Miller. 

Eediscovery of Eeiophorum gracile in Surrey. — In June last 
I met with this rare cotton-grass in a bog in the basin of the River 
Blackwater, where, though very local, it was fairly abundant. 
Some notes on its habitat may be interesting. The plant is 
entirely confined to the wettest parts of the bog, growing, in peaty 
water, among Sphagmim. and the roots and stems of the various 
bog plants, two or three feet about the peat itself. Although the 
roots, which proceed from the base of the flower-stem and from the 
fascicle of leaves which terminates the stolon, are longish, as 
described by Mr. Townsend (Fl. Hants), they do not seem to reach 
the peat below, and the plant a^Dpears to live entirely among the 
moss. It does not occur even on wet peat, and would evidently be 
quite unable to exist on the comparatively dry peat which often 
sufiices for its allies ; thus its disappearance on the approach of 
drainage is explained. The spikes, when in bud, and stolons, arc 
much more slender than those of angustij'olium, the former being

elliptic, and of a beautiful grass-green colour. It will be seen 
from these notes that the term undenj round , as applied to the 
stolons, does not correctly describe the Surrey plant, though this 
would, of course, not be apparent even in the fresh specimens 
from which Mr. Townsend"s description was drawn. It has long 
been extinct in the Wliitemoor Common station, whence a speci- 
men, gathered in 18-1:8, and seen by Mr. Arthur Bennett, is the 
last record known to me of its occurrence there, — W. H. Beeby. 

"Wiltshire Plants (see p. 274). — Mr. Druce's unsuccessful 
search for Carex tnmentosa at Marston Maisey goes to prove that 
this species has at least become extremely rare there. I have had 
repeated hunts after it myself, always in vain, the last being towards 
the close of the June of this year. Even so, I can hardly bring 
myself to believe in the entire extermination — through the partial 
draining of the water-meadows— of this particular Carex in a spot 
where some dozen of its congeners still continue to flourish. The 
fact, however, remains that for some years past the plant has not 
been found there. I observe Mr. Druce records Chara hispida from 
the neighbouring canal. I also observed it there on my last visit, and 
have never seen it there before, though I have frequently botanised 
along the banks, from which I conclude that it does not apj)ear 
every season. As Mr. Druce states. Iris acoriformis Bor. is the 
prevalent form there, but I noted true Pseudacorus in ditches near 
Marston Maisey Village (Wilts). I think it probable the immature 
SiKtryaninm he mentions as most likely neylectam would turn out to 
be merely ramosmn. A month ago I believed our Woodchester 
plant to be the former, so like did its young fruit seem to the figure 
in ' Journal of Botany.' However, as it gradually ripens, I find 
that it is showing itself to be, day by day more clearly, nothing 
but ramosiim. — H. P. Keader. 

Draba biuralis L. in Dorset. — I found this plant in May last in 
the extreme north-west of Dorset, at Higher Wambrook, about one 
mile and a half west of Chard. Many of the stems were quite 
simple. It grew on a very limited area of elevated limestone. 
This record extends its range southwards from North Somerset. — 
W. Bowles Barrett. 

PoDocARPUS insignis Hcmsl. = P. argot.enia. — I very much 
regret to find that I have given a new name (see p. 287) to a 
species of Podocarpus described by Dr. Hance in the ' Journal of 
Botany,' 1883, p. 357. Mr. Ford, who is now in this country, 
called my attention to the fact ; and, when he sent the specimens 
to Kcw, he wrote mentioning that the plant had been published by 
Dr. Hance, though he did not remember the name for the moment ; 
but that letter was not before me at the time I described the plants. 
It is, however, quite inexcusable on my part to have overlooked 
Dr. Hance's published description, especially as I have access to 
Mr. Forbes' s references to all the plants described by the former. 
In extenuation I may add that my description includes the male 
inflorescence, which was unknown to Dr. Hance. — W. Botting 
IIemsley.

NOTICES OF BOOKS. 



Dictionary of the Names of British Plants. Intended for the use of 
amateurs and beginners, as a help to the knowledge of the 
meaning and pronunciation of the scientific names of British 
wild flowers. By Henry Pukefoy Fitzgekald. London : 
Bailliere. Bvo, pp. 90. 

When the author began the study of botany, he " experienced 
a great want in the absence of a book dealing with the names of 
flowers." It is to be regretted that neither then nor since has he come 
across Mr. Alcock's ' Botanical Names for English Readers ' : had 
he done so, he would have found the work he has here undertaken 
ah'eady accomplished, and that in a more satisfactory manner. 
He, however, includes the names of varieties, which Mr. Alcock 
omits : biit the mode of treatment is very unsatisfactory. To be 
told that Bachii is "named after a M. Bach" and Bellardi " named 
in honour of a Mr. Bellard " reminds one of the man who, being 
asked what was an archdeacon, replied "one who performs archi- 
diaconal functions." To render the book of interest, some informa- 
tion — such as dates of birth and death, and some reference to 
published works, if any — should have been given ; and this might 
have been done, in the case of dates at least, without adding to the 
bulk of the book. On the same page with the examples cited we 
find " Baltici. Named after the Baltic, on the shores of which 
this plant is abundant: Bsamvia Baltici'" ; but the name is baltica, 
not Baltici. 

But Mr. Fitzgerald takes more daring flights than this. To be 
told that sirviina is "from Latin scru, I scatter, probably because 
the plants so named are widely scattered," is calculated to surprise

the reader; but it is quite as likely as that SanioUis was " named 
after the Isle of Samos, where the plant was first discovered, by 
Valerand, in the sixteenth century." Of dizoides our author tells 
us that " aides in all words = hke ; resembling aiz."{\) 

We can say nothing in commendation of this little book, save 
that the author's motive in writing it seems to have been an 
excellent one. But he has not succeeded in carrying it out. 



The Report of the Stonyhurst College Observatory for 1884 
contains a list of the dates of the flowering of plants during 
the year . 

Mr. H. C. Hart has pubhshed in the ' Transactions of the Royal 
Irish Academy' a "Report on the Botany of Sinai and South 
Palestine" — the result of his expedition with Prof. Hull in 1883. 
The descriptive account of the journey is written in that pleasant 
readable style with which readers of this Journal are familar in 
Mr. Hart's contributions to our pages, and is followed by a 
systematic list of the plants coUected, about seventy of which are 
new to Palestine, while three — (Tulkun petrcB, Boucerosia Adronis, 
and Daphne linearifolia — are here described and figured for the 
first time. 

Mr. Hart also sends us his ' Report on the Flora of South- 
west Donegal' (Proc. Royal Irish Acad., 2nd Ser., vol. iv.), which 
may be regarded as supplementary to his paper in this Journal 
for 1882. 

A PAMPHLET by M. a. Albert, entitled ' Botanique du Var : plantes 
nouvelles ou rares' (Draquignan, Latil) contains descriptions of two 
new species, Capsella hyhrida and Bunium collinam {" B. Bulbo- 
crtsi«M»./H L., pro parte"); there are also five named forms under 
Capsella Bursa-pastoris. 

The last part (vol. iv., pt. 3) of the ' Proceedings of the British 
Naturalists' Society' contains the eighth instalment of Mr. Oedric 
Bucknall's "Fungi of the British District," with three coloured 
plates ; a paper on Apospory in Ferns, by Mr. G. T. Druery ; and 
an instalment {TrUliacem to NaiadacecB) of the ' Flora of the Bristol 
Coalfields.' 

We are glad to announce the issue of a new part — the ninth — 
of Dr. Braithwaite's ' British Moss-Flora.' It contains the 
conclusion of Tortnla, the description of Pleurochaate, and the 
greater part of Mollla. Twenty -three species are figured on four 
plates, in the usual style of excellence which has marked this work 
from its commencement. 

Mr. Thomas Kirk sends us a reprint of some papers published 
in the ' Transactions of the New Zealand Institute,' " On the 
Flowering Plants and Ferns of Stewart Island" [Dracophyllnm 
Pearsonii, Scirpas muscosus, S. ehenocarpus, Danthonid crassinscula, D. 
flaccida, Poa Walkeri, Polypodium crassium, spp. nn.) ; "On the

Lyallii, Armstrong) ; " Description of a new Fiujuh {F. Blairii) " 
with plate); and "Notes on the New Zealand Beeches." We are 
sorry to see that Mr. Kirk encourages by example the ugly and un- 
authorised spelling which substitutes a small initial for the capital 
in commemorative names. 

We are glad to learn that the valuable information contained 
in the ' Herefordshire Pomona ' with reference to the cider and 
perry industry of Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, Devon, and 
Somerset will be issued in a form easily accessible to those who 
cannot afford the larger work. It will embrace a history of the 
orchards and their management, a description of the best varieties 
of fruits, the chemical analysis of their various juices, and an 
account of the manufacture of cider and perry. Woodcut sections 
of the best varieties of fruit will be given. The price to subscribers 
will be 5s. : address, Messrs. Jakeman & Camer, High Town, 
Hereford. 

Dr. Wittrock has issued a first fasciculus, containing twelve 
numbers, of ' Erythrfeie exsiccatae,' the specimens in which are of 
great beauty and interest. They are : E. pulchella Sm. and typica; 
eight forms of " E. vulgaris (Kafn.) Wittr." (which we usually call 
E. littoralis Fr., and which is recognised by Dr. Wittrock as the 
plant of the ' Noviti^e ' ed. i. and of most Swedish authors ; 
E. glomerata Wittr., a new species much resembling E. capitata, 
but placed in a different section ; E. Centaunum L, a. typica and 
E. capitata «. typica. This last, from Oeland, seems to us to 
correspond very closely with Mr. Townsend's var. sphasrocephala, 
but Dr. Wittrock (who has compared his specimens with the 
original ones of E. capitata in the Berlin Museum) says that the 
latter " differt floribus paullo minoribus, laciniis corollae paullulo 
magis ovalibus obtusisque, sepalis paullo brevioribus." Notes are 
attached to each specimen, and in the Botaniska Notiser for 1884, 
pp. 110 — 118, other remarks upon them by Dr. Wittrock will be 
found.

BOTANICAL NEWS. 

The Scottish Eights of Way Society of Edinburgh lias recently 
sent an active deputation to traverse some of the mountain-paths 
in the centre of the Highlands, and particularly to erect guide- 
posts. This expedition has dealt with the Braemar district, and 
made an excellent beginning. Botanists who have been excluded 
from Glen Doll, Clova, will be glad to hear that a guide-post has 
been erected at its foot, indicating through it a "Public path to 
Braemar." Another notice-board erected previously by Mr. Mac- 
pherson, the proprietor, stands beside it with the inscription, 
" Private entrance to Glen Doll." Experience has proved, since 
this step was taken by the Eights of Way Society, that visitors on 
being challenged have only to assert their determination to proceed 
to gain access to this beautiful and botanically interesting spot. 
Admirable as the action of the Society is in recovering for the 
public so many ancient paths, yet it will be matter for regret, 
especially to naturalists, if this much should satisfy the public 
demand for "access to mountains." Game-keepers will still confine 
travellers to certain tracks, and thus exclude the naturalist from 
his most interesting hunting-grounds. While the gratitude of

OBITUARY. 

Me. Joseph Sidebotham, J.P., F.L.S., &c., of Erlesdene, Bowdon, 
Cheshire, was perhaps — at all events latterly — better known as an 
entomologist than a botanist, his collections of British Lepidoptera 
and Coleoptera ranking among the finest in this country ; but most 
of his attention in his earlier years was bestowed upon the study of 
Botany. In his native place, Apethorne, near Hyde (he was born 
in 1824), he devoted much time to the exploration of the Tame 
Valley, adding no less than twenty-five species to those previously 
rendered. A life-long friend of Mr. L. H. Grindon, the latter 
dedicated to him his ' Manchester Flora,' published in 1859, " in 
admiration of his talents as a successful student of Nature in all its 
branches, and of Botany in particular." For many years he was a 



820 OBITUABY. 

frequent contributor to the ' Pliytologist.' Nor did he alone turn 
his attention to Phanerogamia — Cryptogams merited a full share of 
his research, and he particularly studied the Musci, Fresh-water 
Algae, and Diatomacese. Eespectiug the Musci, as he informed the 
writer of this notice, he was unable to procure a copy of Wilson's 
'Bryologia Britannica' at the time of its first publication, and so, 
borrowing the book fi-om a friend, he most diligently and faithfully 
copied the whole of the plates, including the magnificent drawings — 
a work involving infinite trouble and patience. He was for many 
years a partner in the well-known calico-printing firm called " The 
Strines Printing Company," retiring only in 1876, upon becoming 
possessed of large properties in the neighbourhood of Hyde and 
elsewhere, which came to him upon the death of a relative. When 
at Strines he was always endeavouring to interest his work-people 
in Natural Science, and gave up much time to them, especially in 
contributing articles of interest to the ' Strines Journal,' a MS. 
record of the Botany and Natural History of the locality. Mr. 
Sidebotham was for thirty-three years a member of the Manchester 
Literary and Philosophical Society, and was particularly active in 
the management of its Microscopical and Natural History Section, 
for several years acting as Secretary, and serving on the Council. 
He was also one of the founders of the Manchester Photographic 
Society, aud, in company with Mr. Grindon, of the Manchester Field 
Naturalists' Society. A most intimate friend of James Nasmyth, 
the inventor and astronomer, it was to him that the first discovery 
by Nasmyth of the "willow leaves" structure of the sun's photo- 
sphere was addressed. Indeed, Mr. Sidebotham was himself no 
mean astronomer, and had erected a small observatory in his 
grounds, in which was placed a remarkably fine telescope. A man 
of more varied accomplishments it would be almost impossible to 
find. A great lover of church music, he was a splendid performer 
on the organ, and had built a large one in his house at Bowdon. 
Erlesdene was in fact a perfect treasure-house, stored with beautiful 
and rare objects of Nature and Art, all witnessing to the innate 
force and culture of the man, by their arrangement or by their 
selection. Those whom he numbered among his intimate frieuds, 
and they were many, unanimously testify to his kind, unselfish, and 
simple child-like nature — never so happy as when doing good aud 
benefiting others. Three years ago he built, at a large expense, 
and endowed the beautiful church of St. Anne, Haughton, near 
Denton, but just before the consecration he had the great misfortune 
to lose his wife. He never seemed quite the same man afterwards; 
his health, which had not for some time been strong, necessitating 
wintering abroad for two or three years, gradually declined still 
more, and though his friends hoped he was gradually mending in 
the spring of this year, he passed away on Saturday, May 30th, in 
the sixty-second year of his age, widely and deeply regretted.

There is a great similarity between all the species of this genus, 
but the present seems to differ from all those yet described by its 
indumentum. 

6. Thea hohea L. — In collibus silva densa virginea tectis, 
juxta pagum Ta-man-tai, territorii indigenarum Lai dictorum, ins. 
Hai-nan, d. 14 Nov. 1882, coll. rev. B. C. Henry. Mr. Henry tells 
me that he cannot doubt that tea is really wild here, as it occurs 
here and there in the thick jungle, associated with other plants. 
Tea is not cultivated at all by the Lai tribes, nor do they use it as 
a beverage ; but they pluck and dry the leaves of the wild plant, 
and supply the Chinese settlements with a small quantity of what 
is called " Lai tea." 

7. Gussypii sp. — Leaves entu-e or shortly 3-lobed ; bracteoles 
palmately laciniate, with slender much attenuated segments. 
Flowers ivhite. Fruit bony, used in dyeing, but, according to Mr. 
Henry, produces no cotton. Juxta Lam-ko, ins. Hai-nan, d. 21 
Oct. 1882, leg. rev. B. C. Henry. I do not know what to make of

New Caledonia. (Vieillard, n. 130.) 

8. Kleinlioria hospita L. — In silvis primffivis ins. Hai-nan, d.

badii. Juxta Lam-ko, ins. Hai-nan, d. 24 Oct. 1882, leg. rev. 
B. C. Henry. Probably not separable specifically from H. sjncata ! 
but its very broad three-nerved leaves and a difference in the 
clothing of the calyx give it a distinct aspect.

This differs by the thinner texture of its leaves and smaller 
flowers from any sjpecies known to me. I should station it near 
yyE. ammiKs Thw. ! 

11. Impatientis, sp. nov. — Secus fl. Lien-chau, prov. Canton, 
m. Oct. 1882, leg. rev. E. H. Graves. Only a solitary specimen 
found, and insufficient for examination ; but which, though without 
fruit, T think belongs to Sir J. D. Hooker's braclujcarpce. subcapitttta. 
I. chinensis Lam. is, so far as I know, the only species hitherto 
found in South China, whilst /. noli-me-tangere L. occurs in the 
north.

Prope Wo-slii, ins. Hai-nau, d. 1 Nov. 1882, leg. rev. B. C. 
Henry. (Herb, propr. n. 22286.) 

No species of this interesting genus, respecting the affinities of 
which there is some divergence of opinion amongst botanists 
(Cfr. P>aillon in ' Adansonia ' xi. 102), had previously been recorded 
from China. The Hai-nan plant differs from all the species of our 
Indian empire by its bisexual flowers, in which respect it agrees 
with C. sumatrana Miq. It is not unlike the Amazonian C capituli- 
fera Spruce, except in the texture and vestiture of the leaves. 

13. Celastrus cantonensis, sp. nov. — Scandens, cortice rnbe- 
scente, foliis coriaceis elliptico-oblongis acuminatis parce et remote 
spinuloso- denticulatis utrinque subtiliter elevato-reticulatis lf-2

d. 15 Aug. 1882, coll. operarius liorti Hongkongensis. (Herb, 
propr. n. 22191.) 

Very closely allied to C. vwnosperiiia Koxb., but with narrower, 
thinner leaves, a different inflorescence, and smaller fruit. Flowers 
not seen. 

14. PmIus [Malnchobatus, hexagyni) SwinJtoei Hance. — In monti- 
bus Lo-fau-shau, prov. Cantonensis, alt. 2600 ped. m. Maio 1883, 
leg, J. Calder. Only known hitherto from Formosa. This differs 
from all other members of the group by its numerous ovaries, but 
I cannot doubt that its nearest relative is R. acuminatus Sm. 

15. Casearia (Iroucana) subrhombea, sp. nov. — Foliis 
coriaceis rhombeo-ovatis acuminatis basi cuneatis a triente inferiore 
ad apicem serratis serraturis calloso-glandulosis giaberrimis sub- 
tripli- et penniveuiis venis reticulatis utrinque prominulis 2|-3 poll,

Distinguished by the shape of the leaves, and their glandular 
serratures. 

16. Ammannia [Kuaminannia) senerfalensis Lam. — In montibus 
Pak-wan, prope Cantonem, m. Nov. 1884, leg, T. Sampson. Not, 
I believe, previously gathered in South China. 

17. AcanthopandA' ricinifolia Seem. — In prov. Shan-tung, circa 
Clii-fu, d. 6 Sept. 1880, legg. Forbes & Carles. A Japanese 
species, not, I believe, previously recorded from China. 

18. Hedyotis iDiplophkagma) bracteosa, sp. nov. — Glaber-

rev. E.'Faber. (Herb, propr. n. 22223.) 

The specimens have fully ripe dehiscent fruit, so that I cannot 
describe the flowers. It is very closely allied to H. verticlllaris 
Wall. ! but readily distinguished by the colour and venation of the 
leaves, the greater size of the capitula, and the shape of the con- 
spicuous involucral bracts. In the ' Flora of Brit. India ' (vol. iii. 
pp. 53, 54), Sir Joseph Hooker refers to two Chinese species 
received from me, under their numbers. The first had been 
described in these pages (Journ. Bot. 1879, 11) more than a year 
previously, by the name of H. effusa ; the other as long ago as 1862 
(Ann. sc. nat. 4e. ser. xvii. 221) under that of H. consamjuinea. 

19. Hedyotis xanthochroa, sp. nov. — Perennis, caulibus 
tetragonis sulcatis tomentellis demum glabratis, foliis sessilibus 
elongato-ovatis supra scabridis subtus breviter strigilloso-pilosis sub

In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. Cantonensis, alt. 3400 ped., m. 
Sept. 1883, leg. C. Ford. (Herb, propr. n. 22297.) 

In the absence of fruit it is impossible to determine the proper 
sectional position of this distinctly-marked species ; but I suspect 
it belongs to Dlplophraijnia, though unlike any other known to me. 

20. Morinda viUoaa Hook. f. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. 
Cantonensis, m. Sept. 1883, coll. C. Ford. Only previously known 
from the Khasia monntains. Mr. Ford's plant was determined 
at Kew. 

21. Lasiantlms (nudiflori) Fordii, sp. nov. — Prteter stipulas 
petiolos venas venulasque subtus strigosas glaber, foliis mem- 
branaceis elliptico-lauceolatis exquisite caudato-acumiuatis basi

In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. Cantonensis, m. Sept. 1883, leg. C. 
Ford. (Herb, propr. n. 22280.) 

Judging from the description, for I have seen no specimens, 
this is most nearly allied to L. japonicus Miq., a species overlooked 
by Franchet and Savatier.

In jugo Lo-fau-sban, prov. Cantouensis, m. Sept. 1883, leg. C. 
Ford. (Herb, propr. n. 20511.) 

Most nearly allied apparently to E. Lindleyanum DC, but 
certainly diflerent from that, as well as from all tlie Asiatic species 
I have seen. The E. Tatarian plant referred to E. Lindleyunum in 
the ' Flora Hongkongensis ' is no doubt E. Kirilowii Turcz., which 
is, in my opinion, quite distinct. 

23. Codouopsis lanceulata Benth. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. 
Cantoneusis, m. Sept. 1883, invenit rev. E. Faber. A remarkably 
interesting addition to the Kwang-tung flora, this very lovely 
species having up to the present been known only from Japan, 
Manchuria, and the extreme north of China. 

24. Campanula [Encudon) JnUjens Wall. — Juxta Shui-kwan, 
secus fl. North Eiver, prov. Cantonensis, m. Nov. 1883, leg. rev. 
B. C. Henry. Not previously known from China. In Mr. Henry's 
specimens, which are quite smooth, the flowers are either single or 
2-3 together on a peduncle, and borne on a long raceme at a con- 
siderable distance from each other : the setaceous calyx-teeth are 
four times as long as the tube, and the corolla is divided to 
the base into very narrow segments shorter than the calyx-teeth. 

26. Adenophora verticillata Fisch. — Ad fl. North Kiver, prov. 
Cantonensis, prope Shui-kwan, m. Nov. 1883, leg. rev. B. C. 
Henry. A north-east Asiatic and Japanese plant, now for the first 
time recorded from South China.

territorii indigenarum Lai dictorum, ins. Hai-nan, d. 21 Nov. 1882, 
leg. rev. B. C. Henry. More hairy than specimens from Hong- 
kong, which are, indeed, sometimes almost glabrous. 

27. Symplocos caudata Wall. — In prov. Fo-kien, a. 1861, coll. 
De Grijs. {S. SivmJweana Hance) ; in colliuis, Ning-po, Apr. 1877, 
leg. W. Hancock ; in jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. Cantoneusis, Sept. 
1883, coll. C. Ford. 

28. Osmantlms fragrans Lour. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. 
Cantonensis, m. Oct. 1883, fructiferam leg. rev. E. Faber. The 
only fruiting specimen I have ever seen. The drupe is oblong, 
about 9 lines long, and has a tendency to di'y with a number of 
longitudinal blunt angles or ribs, and the putamen is crustaceous. 

29. Mitrasacme {Mitrmtipie) indica Wight. — In herbidis humidis

by myself near Anioy, in October, 1857, and by Mr. Sampson at 
Swa-tow in Jmie, 1866, in both cases very sparingly, and now first 
recorded from Kwaug-tuug. 

30. Sicertia [Ophelia) vacillans Hance. — In collibus circa Nam- 
fung, ins. Hai-nan, d. 6 Nov. 1882, leg. rev. B. 0. Henry. This 
is, I think, nearest 5. dihita Benth. & Hook, f., from which it 
is midistinguishable in appearance, but differs by the scale covering 
the foveolje.

Cantonensis, circ. 300 m. p. a metropoli septentrionem versus, 
m. Dec. 1883, leg. rev, B. C. Henry. Not previously recorded 
from Kwang-tung. 

34. Centranthera Brmiuniana Wall. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. 
Cantonensis, m. Sept. 1883, coll. rev. E. Faber. I have seen no 
authentic specimen, but the Chinese plant agrees well with 
Bentham's diagnosis, and as to the dimensions of calyx and corolla. 
When the monograph in the ' Prodromus ' was published (1846), 
Martaban was the only locality where it was known to occur, and 
I have no means here of ascertaining its distribution, according to 
more recent investigations.

I had described this as new, under the name of C. loiu/ituba, but 
Mr. Ford gave me the above name, as received from Kew. I leave 
my original diagnosis. The species is evidently a very close ally 
of my C. macrosiphcm (Ann. sc. nat. ser. 5, v. 321), but still perfectly 
distinct.

This pretty genus is new to the Chinese flora. 

40. PeperumuB sp. {" Piper oval if oliuiii Hb. Wight?" Professor

P. dindygulensis Miq. (Ic. pi. Ind. or. vi. t. 1921), of which, how- 
ever, I have seen no specimen.

In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. Cantonensis. (Herb, propr. n. 
22282.) Communicated by Mr. Ford. 

48. Ophiopogon japonicus Ker a. gcnuimis Maxim. — Colitur 
Cantone, ad areas liortorum cingendas, rarissime tamen floret. 
Only known wild from Korea and Japan, but it is highly improbable 
so common a garden plant in South China should have been 
derived from thence. Maximowicz notices its indisposition to 
flower under cultivation in Europe. The specimens before me 
exactly resemble wild ones gathered at Nagasaki by Oldham. 

49. Lycoris Severzovii Eeg. ? — In coemeteriis, Ningpo, copiose 
cum L. radiata Herb., m. Aug. 1877, leg. W. Hancock. I have 
seen no authentic specimen of the Turkestan plant, but this is 
evidently different from, though a good deal like, L. radiata ; and, 
as the stamens are shorter than the perigone-lobes, I infer from 
the remarks in tlie ' Genera plant.' (iii. 728) that this is referable 
to Eegel's species. Mr. Hancock says the flowers are " blue-pink," 
which does not convey any very definite idea to my mind. 

50. Jioictts I^iscJunaultii J. Gay. — In prov. Fo-kien legit De 
Grijs. The only Chinese specimen I have ever seen of this sj^ecies. 
All those which have come under my observation are referable to 
J. smensis J. Gay ; and, although this is reduced to J. LescJicnaultii 
in the ' Flora Hongkongensis,' I entirely agree with Dr. Buchenau 
('Krit. Verzeichn. Juncaceen,' 68) that the two plants are quite 
distinct. J, LeschenauJtii is a perennial, belonging to the division 
Articidati veri of the late Dr. Engelmann's Revision of the North 
American Junci, and is scarcely to be distinguished from the 
common form of J. acununatus Miclix. ! whilst J. sinemis, which is 
annual, falls by the structure of its leaves into the Articidati ensi- 
fulii (Trans. Acad. Sc. St. Louis, ii. 435-6), and is no doubt nearest 
in affinity to J. .dpliiuides E. Mey. e. triandrua Engelm.

61. Potamof/etoiiis sp. — Ad 11. Lieu-cliau, prov. Caiitonensis, m. 
Oct. 1882, coil. rev. li. H. Graves. A solitary fragment of a 
distinct-looking plant, with opposite, very crispate leaves (the 
lamina 3 in. and petiole f in. in length) terminated by a con- 
spicuous rigid apiculus, 1 line long, a thick peduncle with a dense 
spike of flowers about an inch long, and a single fruit, bright 
brown in colour, obliquely ovoid, faintly ribbed, and with a very 
short beak. I have little doubt that this is identical with the plant 
referred to by Maximowicz (Fragm. ad fl. As. or. cognit. mel. 59) 
as found at Peking, in the Philippines, and the Malay Archipelago. 

52. C'l/perus {MariscKs) dilutus Vahl.- — Ad radices montium Pak- 
wan, supra Cantouem, vere 1884, leg. T. Sampson. Very fine speci- 
mens of this showy species, of which I have seen none from any 
other locality in China. 

63. Carex pedifonms C. A. M. — In collibus prope Hu-chau, 
prov. Che-kiang, d. 15 Apr. 1881, coll. Carles et Forbes. I had 
not, before the receipt of this specimen, seen Chinese ones from 
any locality south of the Peking mountains. 

54. Pteris qiiadriaurita Eetz. var. — Juxta pagum Ta-men-tiu, in 
territorio indigenarum Lai, ins. Hai-nan, d. 24 Oct. 1882, leg. rev. 
B. C. Henry. This agrees quite well with Agardh's brief diagnosis 
of P. Grevilleana Wall. (Eev. sp. gen. Pter. 23), and equally so 
with Mr. Baker's note on a Borneo fern collected by Mr. Burbidge, 
and named by him as var. digitata (Journ. Bot. 1879, 40), but I 
have seen neither. Though very different in habit from well- 
developed specimens of 7-". qucidriaurita, it is, I have little doubt, 
referable to that species. The costal spinules are very con- 
spicuous. 

65. AspJeninm rescctmn Sm. — In monte olim ignivomo, nunc 
exstincto, Ta-tun, jurisdictionis Tam-sui, ins. Formosfe, d. 15 Jun. 
1882, leg. W. Hancock. This shows such an evident approach to 
A. heterocarpum Walk by the greater pellucidness of the leaflets, 
their narrow more acuminate shape, and the tendency of the sori 
to be marginal, that I am disposed to think the latter fern may 
prove to be an extreme form of this widely diffused species. 

56. Aspidiimi paludoHum Bl. (Fhei/upteris distcins Mett.). — Ad 
limites territorii indigenarum ins. Formosre, 28 m. p. a Tam-sui, 
austrum versus, in fruticetis dcnsis, d. 12 Feb. 1882, rarissimum 
invenit cl. W. Hancock. Only hitherto known from the Indian 
mountains, Ceylon, and Java. The specimens agree perfectly with 
a Ceylon one from Dr. Bradford. 

67. Polijijodiuni innanimii Wall. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, prov. 
Cantonensis, m. Maio 1883, coll. rev. B. C. Henry. A native of 
the loftier Indian mountains, and found in Formosa, but not before, 
so far as I am aware, in south continental China. 

68. Pobjpodmm Lehnamii Mett. — In jugo Lo-fau-shan, alt. 
2-3000 ped., Maio 1883, satis copiose invenit rev. B. C. Henry. I 
have seen no authentic specimens, but have determined it from 
Mettenius' and Baker's diagnoses. It bears small trifid sterile 
fronds, unlike the fertile ones. Only hitherto known from the 
Himalaya and Burma. 



880 ADDITIONAL LOCALITIKS FOR LAKE-LAND PLANTS. 

59. Pohjpodkmi involutum Mett. — Prope Tam-sui, ins. Formosfe, 
rartim, m. Jan. 1882, leg. W. Hancock. Much smaller than 
Ceylon and Nipal specimens, but apparently rather referable to 
this than to P. Loxugramme Mett. Mr. Hancock notes that in the 
primaeval forest it grows on the horizontal branches of trees. Not, 
that I am aware, heretofore recorded from China. 



ADDITIONAL LOCALITIES FOR LAKE-LAND PLANTS. 
By Alfked W. Bennett, M.A., B. Sc, F.L.S. 

One advantage of the publication of local floras, like Mr. J. G. 
Baker's recent ' Flora of the English Lake-district,' is that it stirs 
up both residents and visitors to record deficiencies or additions. 
To the very great accuracy and value of Mr. Baker's Flora I can 
bear practical testimony. A very few notes made during a six 
weeks' stay between Ambleside and Langdale may be worth 
recording. (W. = Westmoreland ; L. = Lancashire.)

THE HEPATICjE OF GLOUCESTEESHIEE. 

By the Eev. H. P. Eeader, B.A., O.P. 

The following contribution to the hepaticology of Gloucester- 
shire is the result of personal observation at intervals during five 
years. It cannot therefore pretend to be complete, but, so far as 
it goes, will serve to show that this county, which has a deserved 
reputation for a rich and interesting phanerogamic flora, may also 
be considered fairly productive in this particular department of 
cryptogams. I have been fortunate in finding the fruit of several 
species which, though generally abundant in the barren state, are 
rarely fertile. 

Marcliantia polymorpJia L. E. & W. Common. Fruit plentiful. 

Convcephalus cunicus Neck. E. & W. Common. Fruit locally 
abundant in the spring.

Sapperton Tunnel and Hayley Wood, 1881, 1885. Fruit. 

Luntdaria vulgaris Mich. E. & W. Common in gardens and 
greenhouses. Gemmiferous, but no fruit. 

Pdccia tjlauca L. W. Sandy ditch-banks near Littledean. 
Probably common elsewhere.

Lindb. W. On banks. Pen Wood, King Stanley. 

Anthoceros IcBvis Dill. W. Sandy ditch-banks near Littledean, 
with liiccio glauca. 

The occurrence of several other species, such as Ccphaluzia 
connivens, OdontoscJdsma Sphagni, Lepidozia setacea, and Blepharozia 
ciliaris, may fairly be presumed. So far, however, I have neither 
seen nor heard of them in the county. Any addition to the above 
list which may come under my notice I shall hope to record from 
time to time in the ' Journal of Botany.'

BOTANICAL NOTES OF A TOUE IN CAITHNESS AND 

SUTHERLAND, JULY, 1885. 
By the Eev. H. E. Fox, M.A., and Frederick J. Hanbury, F.L.S. 

To the ordinary tourist Caithness does not present a promising 
field for floral search. The long stretch of wet moorland through 
which the railway passes is only succeeded hy the fringe of coast- 
cultivation, even less picturesque than the other, and both without 
a tree or hedgerow to break the monotony of flatness. The flag- 
stones which mark the divisions of the fields in severely regular 
lines are not suggestive of much but agricultural economy. The 
elevation of the greater part is slight, and the sluggish streams 
which drain the peat-bogs of the central area are quite unlike the 
brawling burns which the traveller crosses on his northward journey. 
The district, however, is not without its botanical riches. 

The county of Dick could not fail of interest to fellow lovers of 
Nature. An evening stroll along the banks of the Thurso River 
did not yield us the Hierochlue, which grows almost opposite the 
spot where the Caithness naturalist lies buried. The plant is at all 
times difficult to be found, and has probably suffered at the hands 
of collectors ; its season, too, was long past ; a single head, how- 
ever, was gathered about three weeks before our arrival by Mr. A. H. 
Bremner, of Thurso, which he kindly gave us. Juncus balticiis, Carex 
aquatilis var. Watsimi and C. ampuUacea were abundant along the 
margin of the stream. Vicia si/lvatica was growing on the grassy 
banks opposite the cemetery, the only locality in which we noticed 
it in either county. Trull ius europmis, which is fi-equent everywhere 
in the two counties, adorned the meadow herbage. Viola tricolor 
and Anchxisa arrensis were the characteristic weeds of the cultivated 
soil, with SiJenjida arrensis and LamiiDii amplexicanle. L. purpureum 
and L. interinediuni were also common ; but L. album was not seen, 
and is said not to grow in the county. Cariim. Car id occurred as a 
casual by the road-side near Thurso, but was abundant, and had all 
the appearance of being native further west, on sand-hills at the 
mouth of Strathalladale. The sand-hills of Murkle Bay produced 
Cakile maritima, Cerastium tetrayidruin, Elijmus arenaritcs, flowering 
abundantly, and other common maritime plants ; and where the 
ground was wet, Pamassia palustris, Primula veris, Pinyuicula 
vuli/aris, and Orchis latifolia grew almost down to the sea ; the latter 
was especially fine and abundant, and with its deep crimson flowers 
was one of the most conspicuous plants of the neighbourhood in 
almost every field and ditch. SciUa verna is common on all the 
grassy headlands. 

Taking the train to Bilbster, we crossed a short piece of wet 
moorland which surrounds the shallow and boggy Loch Winless. 
Aira pracox and A. cari/oiiJn/llca abound on all the drier spots, as 
leverywhere on the peat-soil through the two counties. Hippuris 
vidf/aris, Comarum palustre, Veronica scntellata, Catabrusa aquatica, 
and Chara fragilis were noted in ditches at the head of the lake. 
In the lake itself the most interesting plant was Xuphar piimila, 
not easy of access on account of the treacherous but Lorn of thick

mud, above which it floats. Equiseluni limosum was abundant, and 
on a sandy promontory we found Leontodon pratensis. In the 
stream flowing out of the lake Potamofietmifiliformts, Mi/no}ihylliim 
(tlternijionun. (very common also elsewhere), and Heloscunliuni inmi- 
datum occurred. 

Crossing a slight rise by the main road, we struck the Wick 
River at the point where it is crossed by the railway. Three 
hundred yards below this we found Curex salina /3. kuttef/utensis, 
which was discovered for the first time last year by Mr. J. Grant ; 
it was growing in abundance, together with Carex Watsoni, and 
continued on both banks of the river to within a mile and a half of 
the town. Mini ul its luteus, thoroughly established in marshy places 
by the river-side, was flowering in beautiful contrast with Mi/osotis 
strUjulosa Reich. We were unsuccessful in our search for Ajiuja 
jiyramidaUs, which is recorded from the banks of this river ; but it 
was late in the season for this, and the herbage was very high. We 
gathered Fi;rola media among the heather about a mile and a half 
above the town. Bhjsmus rufus and Scirpus unvilurnis, with other 
salt-marsh plants, grew lower down among stones at the edge of 
the river. At Wick we were fortunate in making the acquaintance 
of Mr. J. Grant, and enjoying the hospitality of his family. This 
intelligent young botanist has already been successful in adding 
two plants to the British Flora from his own county, which have 
escaped previous observers. 

The road westward from Thurso passes over the low watershed 
between the river of that name and the Forss. Besides Primula 
scotica, a very pale and dwarf form of Anthyllis Vulneraria, and 
Carex dioica (which latter is common everywhere in marshy places 
through the two counties), nothing of special interest was noted 
till the sea was again struck at the mouth of the Forss River. 
Lujusticum scuticum and Populus tremula were here growing on the 
low rocky clifl's near the shore. The common Primrose was still 
flowering (July 7th) on grassy banks and along the headlands; its 
exquisite northern congener, P. scotica, again occurred in profusion, 
together with a very dwarf and richly-coloured form of Kuphrasia 
officinalis, with capsules much longer than the calyx, apparently 
the form called E. maritiina in Hooker's ' Student's Flora,' hitherto 
recorded only from Shetland. Silene maritima, Plantago Coronopus, 
and P. vKtritiiiia presented a curious appearance, on account of their 
stunted growth and abnormally-thickened leaves. 

At Downreay, about two miles west of the Forss, we met with 
Oxytropis Uralensis for the first time ; it recurs in more or less 
abundance along the coast at various places, but we did not notice 
it further west than the mouth of the Borgie. 

Mertensia maritiina was gathered in a sandy bay about two miles 
east of Reay. The sand-hills of this place are full of interest. The 
burn which flows past the little inn to the sea is choked with 
masses of a cultivated form of Miinulus, which was swept out of a 
neighbouring garden some years ago by a winter flood, and has

and in damp sandy places near the sea Carex incnrva in some 
plenty ; this is a fairly common sedge on the maritime sands of 
Sutherlandshire, and, amongst other places, was growing in fine 
form at Farr Bay and the shores of the Naver. On tlie Keay links 
a very large and distinct variety of VUiplirasui njfinnalis * was noticed, 
as well as the following: — Thalictrum minus var. mdritiinnm, Spinm 
Uimarid, Lujusticnni scotieiim, and Hahenaria viridis, which were all 
growing in the loose sand and struggling with the universal 
Psamma arenaria ; and by the rocky margins of a burn to the E . of the 
Links a Hieracium which does not appear to agree with any known 
British species, and about which we hope to write at a future date. 

Melvich, at the moutli of iStrathalladale, is worth a visit on 
many accounts. Besides fair loch-fishing in the neighbourhood, 
some of the finest coast-scenery in E. Sutherland is close to the 
village. There is also a comfortable inn, which has not yet been 
turned into a tourist-haunted hotel. Oxijtwpis Uralensis grows in 
great luxuriance in several places along the cliffs. Sedimi lihodiola 
descends to the sea-level. On the moors westward iiaheiiaria aJhlda 
is not inh-equent. 

A little before the main road reaches the Naver it crosses the 
opening of Farr Bay, where Botnjchimn Lunana was growing, 
curiously associated with Triticuiii jimceum, Centaurea Scahiosa, and 
Oxytropis in dry sand. On broken ground below the cliffs, which 
rise above the road half a mile east of the Bettyhill Inn, the 
vegetation was more rich and varied. A tangled undergrowth of 
blackthorn, hazel, and rowan concealed luxuriant oak and beech 
ferns. The yellow heads of TruUius and Uier<iciiuii'''- dotted the 
darker background, and sea-green clumps of Eock rose clung to 
the grey crags. Arena /nibescens was also observed. An equally 
interesting but quite different piece of ground on the other side of 
and below the inn, along the river-bank, will repay search. The 
soil is sandy, but saturated With moisture, and bears a rich herbage, 
amongst which !Saxifra(/a aizoides, Listera ovata, Gyvmadenla conujisea, 
and Carex capillans were the most noteworthy, Carex extensit var. 
minor, Bhjsmiis nifus, a curious and very slender form of Jmicus 
Gerardi, and Scirpus paucijiurus grew at the margin of the river, 
bushy shrubs of Rosa spinosmUiia and Pupulus tremula higher up, 
and on all the drier banks a luxuriant growth of Oxijtropia. 

The sandy fiats on the west shore of the Naver yielded abun- 
dance of Carex incur ca, and several jjatches of Juucus halticus. At 
the base of the low hills which come down to the shore Bryas octo- 
petala, of a peculiarly stout and vigorous growth, was holding its 
own, even on the wind-driven sands. A few feet higher up on the 
rocks were Arabis hirsuta, Saxifraya oppositifolia, Taraxacum pahistre, 
Hieracium viurorum, Asplenium Trichovianes, and Cystopteris frayilis. 
Carex capillaris was again abundant, and Primula scutica in a wet 
hollow among the hills. On the boggy slopes leading down to the 
B(u-gie Pinyuicula lusitanica, which occurs plentifully everywhere 
westward, was noted for the first time, with its usual companions, 

* We hope to supplement this short paper by a few critical notes ou the 
forms of Hieracia, Euphrasia, and Carex vtilyaris found on this northern coast, 
but must defer this for the present.

Drosera rotimdifoUa aud D. anr/lica. The drier ground was covered 
with juniper and ArcUMaphijloH Uva-ursi, amongst which appeared a 
few phints of Draba incana and the last of (Xei/tropis. Small marshy 
lochs on the moorland beyond the river produced a dwarf form of 
NymphcRd alba, Lobelia Dortmanna, and Carex (impullacea. Potaimxjeton 
lieterophyllus and NiteJla optica were gathered in a little loch by the 
road-side, and Pijrola minor in woods near Tongue House. 

The weather prevented much botanising on the Kyle of Tongue 
or Loch Erribol. The ground between the two is a low dreary 
moorland, and only interesting for fine views of Ben Hope and the 
neighbouring mountains. 

Leaving Erribol, we again met with Dryas and Draba near the 
Smoo Cave. At the same place ValerianeUa olitoria, abundant 
forms of Hicraciuiii (anylicuin/), Scolopendriuin vuhjare, and Cystopteris 
frayilis were conspicuous, marking the presence of the limestone, 
which gives so striking a character to the flora of Durness. On 
hillocks by the road-side west of the Durness Inn ThaUctrum 
alpinum, Draba incana, Dryas octopetala, Rubus saxatil/is, Hieracium 
Cixsium., and Fpipactis ovalis Bab. formed an interesting group 
of plants, together with Antennaria dioica and Botrychium Lu- 
naria, which are both common throughout the whole of West 
Siitherlandshire. In a dried-up loch at the back of the Free 
Church Juncus balticus with two or three forms of Carex vuhjaris 
occurred, aud in the stream flowing out of its northern end 
Potamoyeton filifonnis in fine fruit. 

The sand-hills leading to Far-out Head are full of ThaUctrum 
minus var. maritimnm and Viola Curtisii. Several patches of 
Primula scotica lay in the damper hollows, and Scilla verna almost 
formed the herbage on the dry headlands. Sedum Rhodiola, Silene 
maritima, and Armeria maritima grew in every chink of the rooks, 
Avena pubescens on the grass-lands. In a wet meadow about three- 
quarters of a mile north of the inn we found, besides Menyanthes 
tri/oliata and other marsh-loving plants, Carex dioica, C. teretimcula, 
and C. limosa. A low range of hills bounds the limestone area on 
the east ; on the most northern and lowest of these, Benin 
Ceannabeinne, Saussurea alpina was growing at an elevation of 
scarcely 300 ft. Arctostaphylos alpina and Juniperus nana covered 
the summit, a few stunted plants of Listera cordata amongst them. 
In a marshy pool where the road crosses the Alt Smoo we gathered 
Carex /iliformis, with C. ampnUacea and Lobelia Dortmanna . 

Time prevented our reaching Cape Wrath, and our next halting 
place was the tidy little village of Scourie, with its comfortable inn. 
Handa Island, which is distant about half an hour's sail, is well 
worth a visit, but chiefly for its magnificent clifl's and the extra- 
ordinary number and variety of the sea-birds which frequent them. 
We were not successful in finding any plants of much interest on 
the island itself ; but in the neighbourhood of Scourie we gathered 
Sayina saxatilis, Sedum anylicum on rocks above the village, Lobelia 
Dortmanna, NympJuca alba, Scirp}(s fiuitans, and Malaxis paludosa 
in a small loch south of the village (marked on the Ordnance Map 
Leathan nan Cruicheanj, and on boggy ground at its head. By

the road to Badcall, about half-way between it and Scouric, is Locban 
Dubh, in which Potanioi/eton nit ens was growing; and a low hundred 
yards further a piece of marshy ground, in whicli Carer, liinosa and 
Vtricularia interi)icdia were abundant, tiie latter without a trace of 
flower. On rocks south-west of Scourie Asplenluiii iinirinum wag 
growing scantily, Litiusticuin scotictim and Sediwi Hhoiliuhi plentifully, 
and on crags at Badcall was Hieracium pallidum. 

The long drive to Lairg yielded nothing of special interest. 
Birch-trees clothe the lower parts of the hills. Populns Ireinnla and 
Horn spinosissima cling to the rocks. A few hollies and an occasional 
stunted oak give variety to the higher foliage. 

To those who could give longer time than our hurried tour 
allowed us, and could include some of the higher mountains, as 
Morven, Ben Hope, Foiniven, and Ben Arkle in their search, the 
two counties would doubtless yield many other plants of interest ; 
but our notes are enough to show that there are few districts in 
Great Britain where a walk of ten days would bring within reach 
of the botanist so rich and varied a flora.

MIDDLESEX PLANTS. 
By John Benbow. 

The following plants, apparently not frequent in Middlesex, 
were gathered in the early summer of this year : — 

Ranunculus parvijiorus. Uxbridge and Uxbridge Moor. 

Moenchia erecta. Uxbridge Common. 

TriyoncUa ornithopodioides. Abundant on waste land west of 
Hounsiow, near the bridge on the Staines road, with Moenchia erecta 
and Myosotis collina. 



MIDDLESEX PLANTS. 339 

ValeriancUa auricula. Between Eastcote and Northwoocl (new 
record). 

Crcpis taraxacifolia. Thames side near Hampton Court (new 
record). — C. biennis. In great iDrofusion in a meadow by Wood 
Hall, near Pinner ; and again abimdaut in meadows about Hare- 
field. Beyond doubt therefore a well-established species in Middle- 
sex. Specimens are also occasionally met with about Iver Heath, 
in Bucks, a mile or two from Uxbridge. 

Orchis pijramidalis. Several plants near Harefield ; and sparingly 
on the downs near Springwell. — 0. militaris. Several plants north 
of Harefield.— 0. (ati/olia. Meadow near Uxbridge. — 0. incarnata. 
Meadows near Drayton Ford. 

Opkrys apifera. Frequent on hilly pastures about Harefield and 
Springwell. 

Hahenaria chJorantha. Several plants near Harefield. It is a 
curious fact that none of the Orchids reported by Blackstone 
and Collinson to be abundant in the old chalk-pits at Harefield, 
about the middle of the last century, have ever been found there 
since. It is noticeable also that they were all stated to be collected 
in this one spot only, and nowhere else in the neighbourhood. A 
cursory search of a few hours, however (assisted by my son and 
nephew), was sufiicient to prove that they are not all of them 
extinct, as hitherto supposed, and that they are to be found, more- 
over, in stations beyond the area of the old chalk-pits. It is 
possible that others may hereafter be added to the list ; for a much 
closer survey of the district is yet required to exhaust the chances 
of further discovery. 

Luzula Forsteri. Pinner Wood (confirming Mr. Hind's record). 

Eriophorum poh/stachion. Moors below Springwell Lock. 

Carex paradoxa. Extremely abundant on the moors below 
Springwell Lock ; in meadows between Denham Lock and Hare- 
field Moor ; and not infrequent by the side of ditches and canals 
from Denham Lock to the boundary. It grows also in the con- 
tiguous meadows of Herts. I at first concluded that this was a 
new record for Middlesex, but have since discovered that Mr. 
Warren gathered a specimen by the " canal near West Drayton," 
which he queried C. paradoxa /, and which it undoubtedly is. A 
straggler had therefore found its way some five or six miles lower 
down the valley. 

Arena pubescens. Very abundant in all the meadows round 
Harefield, Springwell, and Drayton Ford. It is strange that both 
this and the preceding, two of the commonest plants in our district, 
should for so many years have escaped detection. Up to the date 
of publication of Trimen and Dyer's ' Flora of Middlesex ' there 
had been no record of A. irubescens (save as a casual in 1688). Dr. 
Trimen collected a specimen in 1871 from " Hillingdon Place, near 
Uxbridge," but this could only have been a straggler from the 
chalk ; for, although living on the spot myself, I have never noticed 
it there, nor, indeed, anywhere nearer than the Harefield district, 
where it abounds. I gathered several plants of this species and 
Bromus erectus in the spring on the tow-path near Hampton Court ;

but similarly they must have been merely waifs from some of the 
upper reaches of the Thames. 

Kouleria cristata. Uxbridge Common. 

And since the above : — 

JHaiUhus Anneria. On rough gravelly banks of the railway 
between Uxbridge and West Drayton. 

Polijyonuiii mite. Near West Drayton. — P. minus. Shallow 
drains on Harefield Moor, 

It will thus be seen that Orchis pyra7Hidalis, O. militaris, Habe- 
naria chlorantha, and Avena pubescens are happily not yet lost to the 
county flora.

distinctio in forma squamarum calycinarum, subsectionibus Macro-

Epilobium Lamyi F. Scbultz in Worcestershire. — I gathered 
specimens of this ])lant from an arable field near Malvern a few 
weeks ago. It was growing in great abundance, but, owing to most 
of the plants having their lower leaves much withered, it was im- 
possible to procure good examples. Mr. Eidley, who has seen some 
of the specimens, suggests, with great probability, that when it is 
better known it will prove to be much more common than is usually 
supposed. It may easily, before the development of the rosettes, 
be passed over for nhscuruw, and later, when the leaves of the stem 
become withered and the rosettes apparent, for teiragonum. It is, 
however, a smaller plant than either. Possibly, if herbarium 
specimens labelled '' obscurum," yet wanting the long styles, were 
examined, some might prove to be this species. — E. F. Towndrow.

to Mr. Brebuer's remark on the Glen Dole station, I may say I

gathered by the late Mr. Sadler in 1872 " on Craig Maid, Glen 
Dole." — Arthur Bennett.

nately unable to add the fiuisliing touches to the description of 
this order, and Mr. N. E. Brown, of Kew, has been entrusted 
by the pubhshers with seeing it through the press. 

The species are described under the two genera Chara and 
Nitella, Tobjpella and LycJmothammis being treated as sections. 
Dr. Boswell has taken the "himping'' view of these plants, 
describing nineteen species and reducing to the rank of varieties 
several which are usually regarded as species, such as Xitella 
capitata, Tolijpdla prolijera, and ('hura puli/acaiitlia. The de- 
scriptions are drawn up in Dr. Boswell's usual careful manner, 
and it is much to be regretted that the completion of the work has 
necessarily fallen into other hands. A number of additions have 
been made by Mr. N. E. Brown, many of which are unnecessary 
or erroneous ; indeed, most of the sentences of any length included 
in square brackets contain one or more blunders. This might 
have been excused in one having no previous knowledge of the 
gi'oup had it not been for the dogmatic and authoritative tone 
adopted. The off-hand manner in which the conclusions of the 
greatest authority on the order, the late Alex. Braun, are dismissed 
would certainly be amusing, as showing what intense egotism can 
produce, were it not for the discredit thereby brought upon British 
Botany ; for instance, under ^Y. nidijica Mr. Brown did not happen 
to see the difference between plants which Braun had dis- 
tmguished, so he had no doubt Braun was wrong, and wrote, 
•' The nucules examined by Braun must have been quite immature 
ones." As if Prof. Braun did not know unripe nucules when he 
saw them ! 

The trustworthiness of Mr. Brown's work may be gathered 
from the remarks under C.fragifera, p. 217, where, after referring, 
m a footnote, to our notice of a monoecious state, and saying that 
he had not seen a specimen, he unhesitatingly states of the globules, 
" Barely on the same plant, and placed immediately beneath the 
nucule." Now, as he professes to rely on our statement as to the 
existence of a monoecious state, his description of the position of 
the globules (Avhich happens to be quite erroneous as regards our 
specimen) must be purely conjectural. Again, under .Y. (jlomerata 
var. Smithii, he writes : — " I have very carefully examined Mr. 
Borrer's Lancing specimen, and only find globules upon it, not a 
trace of a nucule : this is therefore, I have no doubt, another case 
of a polygamous species, as in that of N. Jlexilis." Now, any one 
in the habit of examining CJiaraceie should have had no difficulty 
in finding young nucules on that specimen. We first have an in- 
excusable blunder, and then one of those generalisations which 
seem to come so naturally to the careless observer. We will cite 
but one more passage, p. 216: — " C. cunnivens appears to be but a 
sexual state of C.Jhtgilis, as strictly it only difi'ers from that plant 
in sex." Comment on this would be superiluous.

NOTES ON SOME PLANTS FEOM NOKFOLK ISLAND. 

By Baron Von Mueller, K.C.M.G., M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S. 

Last year, when offering to this Journal the description of 
Asplenium Rohinsonii, (pp. 289-290), I had occasion to refer 
also to Pterocarpus australis from the same locality as likely 
belonging to Wistaria or Millettia, which two genera might well be 
combined. This supposition has proved to be correct, because Mr. 
Isaac Eobinson has succeeded after much search to find of the 
large climber, assigned by Endlicher to Pterocarpus, at last a single 
fruit, which is completely in accord with Millettia, as will be seen 
from the following notes : — 

Pod (the only one seen) ellipsoid, turgid, ending gradually into 
an almost subulate apex, tapering also at the base, tardily and 
imperfectly dehiscent, glabrescent and brownish outside, including 
the apex, 8|- in. long, nearly l^- in. broad ; valves hard, thick, 
almost lignescent ; cavity divided by cross-partitions between the 
seeds, invested by a whitish fibrous membrane. Seeds only two 
ripened, measuring f-1 in., almost globular, but next to the septa 
more or less truncate, yellowish brown, smooth ; hilum much 
elongated, linear ; testa coriaceous, pallid inside ; embryo emitting 
a strong odour, when dry of horny hardness, whitish fresh, turning 
livid ; cotyledons nearly equal ; radicle about f in. long, ellipsoid, 
placed obliquely, only a small portion emerging beyond the cotyle- 
dons. Several ovules remain undeveloped, therefore the fruit may 
ripen sometimes more than two seeds. 

Thus we have also now become aware that Millettia australis 
approaches closely M. nm/asperuia : the leaflets are, however, almost 
blunt, and reticulated by more prominent veins ; the stalklets of 
the flowers are shorter, the bracts narrower, the calyx-lobes shorter 
and less pointed, the pod produced is into a longer apex, and not 
velvety outside. It may, however, here be mentioned that the late 
M. de la Camera insisted on the occurrence of two kinds of Wistaria 
on the Eichmond Eiver, one with pods nearly glabrous outside, 
containing more numerous seeds of hardly half the size of those of 
the true M. mei/asi>erma. He found this Wistaria — which, in memory 
of his zealous collecting efforts in the primeval forests of East 
Australia, I wish to call as a species or variety Millettia or Wistaria 
Camerana — to climb up to a height of eighty feet or even more ; the 
flowering specimens from the Eichmond Eiver show also consider- 
able differences of the length of the calyx-lobes, which may indicate 
specific discrepancies. 

While offering these remarks on a long-misunderstood plant of 
Norfolk Island, it may here not be out of place to note that the 
great fern investigator, Mr. J. G. Baker, refers to Asplenium 
Robinsonii as the doubtful recorded variety of A. squannilatum of 
Hooker's Spec. Filicum, iii. 88, the origin of which had remained 
for very many years obscure ; this particular fern, now shown to be 
a native of Norfolk Island, is evidently not identical with Blume's 

Journal of Botany. — Vol. 23. [Dec, 1885.] 2 a

A. sqitamuIatiDii. of Java, Borneo, and the Philippine Islands, but 
probably endemic to the far-isolated oceanic spot as a remnant of 
a bygone vegetation, where indeed it is now nearly extinct, as 
trading horticulturists have carried away three of the only five 
individual plants known from various spots of the island. Mr. 
Eobinson writes concerning this fern, that in habit it is not unlike 
A. Nidus, so that four fronds gathered from one plant could scarcely 
be missed, and that all fronds appeared fructified, yet it shows no 
inclination for natural dispersion ; specimens lately received exhibit 
the spikes semiterete and channelled, and the apex of the frond 
acute. 

In Endlicher's list and Cunningham's addition of Norfolk 
Island plants is not contained Mclicytus ramijiorus, a plant all the 
more interesting from thence, as it seems nowhere represented by 
any congeneric form in the flora of Continental Australia. As 
regards the Olea from Norfolk Island, it might be now incidentally 
remarked that it should be distinguished as Olea Endlicheri, inas- 
much as Vahl described in the Symbols, iii. 3, his Olea apctala 
from New Zealand.

PBOTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACEM. 

By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc. 

Part II. 

The following notes and observations are a continuation of 
those embodied in a paper on the above subject which appeared in 
a recent issue of this Journal.* They should, indeed, have formed 
part of that communication, but their publication was unavoidably 
postponed.

PKOTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE^. 355 

HiMANTHALIA LOEEA Lyilgb. 

The stalked, funnel-shaped thallus of this "weed," witli its 
coriaceous fruit-body divided dichotomously into thong-like branches, 
is a well-known inhabitant of British coasts. In its mode of repro- 
duction and general structure it closely agrees with the Fucacece 
already dealt with, and with which systematists usually associate 
it. The thallus is composed of Epidermal, Cortical and Central or 
Medullary tissues, though there is no sharp line of distinction 
between them. Save in the presence of the conceptacles bearing 
antheridia or oogonia, the reproductive part, which constitutes by 
far the major portion of the thallus, has substantially the same 
structure as the sterile part. 

The Epidermal tissue is composed of several layers of cells, 
often so connected with one another that the cells of each layer 
appear to arise by the dichotomous branching of those of the next 
inner layer. The cells of the outermost layers have their longest 
diameter perpendicular to the surface of the thallus, and their 
narrow, oblong, or wedge-shaped protoplasts forcibly remind one of 
the columnar epithelium of animal mucous membranes. 

The Cortical tissue is a thick parenchymatous mass, whose con- 
stituent elements vary in size and shape, and in the thickness of 
their walls. Small where they abut on the epidermal tissue, they 
become longer and stretched in the longitudinal direction, towards 
the interior, and finally pass over somewhat abruptly into the fila- 
ments and fibres which constitute the central tissue. The proto- 
plasts are irregular in shape, and send out radiating pseudopodia- 
like processes in various directions. Transverse and longitudinal 
sections show that the cell-walls are more strongly thickened in 
the middle region of the cortex than in the inner and outer 
portions. 

The Central tissue, like that of other Fucoids, is composed of 
cellular, filamentous structures, which originate, at least in part, as 
outgrowths from the cortical cells. These are loosely interwoven 
longitudinally and transversely, though the great majority run in 
the former direction. Two kinds may be distinguished, viz., fila- 
ments proper and fibres. The former are stouter, have more homo- 
geneous walls, and more watery protoplasmic contents. Their 
articulations are provided with a thick annular ingrowth, which 
surrounds the transverse partitions where such are present. A 
constriction of the outer surface, at irregular intervals, is a common 
phenomenon in these filaments. The fibre-like structures are 
finer, and have very dense protoplasmic contents, while their walls 
are longitudinally laminated. At intervals, which are sometimes 
considerable, are placed transverse septa, which are extremely 
oblique, tbe fibres in this, as in other characters, resembhng the 
fibres described and figured in Ascophijlluja nudusum.* Both fila- 
ments and fibres branch more or less freely, but the former are not 
connected with each other by lateral diverticula, as are those of the 
plant named. 

* Loc. cit,, p. 99. 



356 PROTOPLASMIC CONTINUITY IN THE FUCACE;E. 

In examiiiiug these tissues for evidences of the continuity of 
the protoplasm, great difficulties have been met with, greater even 
than those encountered in the Fiici. Hence the results, though 
conclusive as to the existence of continuity in the central and 
cortical tissues, are not quite demonstrative as to its permanence, 
nor as to its extension over the whole thallus. The methods 
employed for preparing sections for examination were those already 
described in detail, swelling and clarifying reagents being absolutely 
indispensable. 

In good sections prepared by these methods, stained, &c., the 
following details may be made out with tolerable ease : — 

1. The protoplasm of the filaments, fibres, and cortical cells is 
certainly interrupted, in many cases, at the transverse partitions, 
longitudinal contraction of the proloplasts having at least equalled 
that in other directions. 

2. In other cases, however, there are indisputable phenomena 
of continuity conforming to at least two of the types met with in 
AscvpJiylhivi nodosum. Thus in the filaments and fibres of the 
central tissue, as well as in the cortical cells, many instances are 
met with in which the continuity is brought about directly by a 
comparatively stout undivided cord of protoplasm. Others are to 
be found, though scarcely more frequently, in which continuity is 
effected by means of a sieve plate, in which case the pores are 
either scattered over the whole plate or restricted to its margin. 
There are also cases which give rise to the suspicion that continuity 
is sometimes maintained by a single, central, attenuated, thread of 
protoplasm, but a perfect demonstration of this can hardly be said 
to have been obtained. 

With regard to the epidermal tissue, it must be admitted that 
decisive preparations either for or against continuity are still a 
desideratum. The best sections hitherto obtained seem to point to 
previously existing connecting threads running from protoplast to 
protoplast, but in none of them have such threads been found intact. 
It may be that the modes of treatment are too rough for such 
delicate structures as these, but in any case this point will require 
further investigation. 

From what has been stated it will be obvious that in Hiiuanthalia 
lorea the arrangements for continuity are either not so universal or 
not so permanent as in the Fuci, or else they are more easily 
destroyed. Taking all the circumstances of the case into careful 
consideration, and giving due weight to the appearances presented 
by the sections, even where the continuity is interrupted, the 
writer regards the last of these possibilities as by far the most 
probable one. 

Laminaria digitata Lamx. 

Though not usually classed with the Fucaced, Laminaria diijitata 
may be dealt with here, seeing that in histological structure and 
the phenomena of continuity it exhibits, it bears some resemblance 
to the forms already considered. 

Sections through the thallus show that, both in the rounded 
stipes and the flattened lamina, the tissues may be described as 



FLINTSmilE PLANTS NOT RECORDF-D IN ED. 2 <)!<' ' TOP. BOT.' 357 

epidermal, cortical, and medullary or central, though the aspect of 
these is not quite the same as the tissues so named in other forms. 
In the stipes the epidermal tissue consists of several layers of small 
cells, placed in rows vertically to the surface. The cortex is un- 
usually thick, and is formed of cellular elements with greatly 
thickened walls, while the medullary tissue is reduced to a thin 
central band. The lamina presents the same series of tissues, but 
the epidermal layers are not so numerous. In both portions the 
central tissue is made up of branched filamentous structures, which 
run longitudinally, closely interwoven with others of a more 
fibrous character, which, for a part of their course at least, run 
transversely. 

To observe the phenomena of continuity presented by sections 
of these tissues recourse must be had to the most effective reagents 
for swelling, clarifying, and even partially dissolving the strongly- 
thickened walls of the histological elements. In sections success- 
fully treated with these ends in view, it is not difficult to make out 
an elaborate system of connections between the protoplasts, both 
in the central and the cortical tissue. The type of continuity here 
presented is chiefly, if not exclusively, that which is maintained 
through the intervention of a sieve -plate. The protoplastic con- 
tents of the central structures are for the most part reduced to 
comparatively small threads, but at the transverse partitions they 
dilate to the full breadth of the plate. In some cases the whole 
plate is traversed by the connecting threads, but in others the 
connections appear to be altogether peripheral. 

The protoplasts of the cortex are rhizopod-like masses, with 
pseudopodia spreading in such a manner that the cells of each 
layer are brought into connection both with one another and with 
those of adjacent layers. As in the centre, continuity is effected 
through the intervention of sieve-plates, the whole or merely the 
periphery of which may be traversed by the protoplasmic threads. 

As in the case of Rimanthalia lurea, the presence of continuity 
in the epidermal tissue is still doubtful, though a^Dpearances are 
suggestive of it. The fact remains, nevertheless, that in spite of 
many efforts to make a suspicion a certainty, a demonstrative case 
has not yet been met with. 



FLINTSHIRE PLANTS NOT KECOEDED IN ED. 2 
OF 'TOPOGRAPHICAL BOTANY.' 

By Kobert Brown. 

Although the county of Flintshire in North Wales is of small 
extent, the Flora is varied and extensive. Including the estuary of 
the River Dee, it possesses a considerable amount of sea-coast, and 
its geological features are of much interest. Limestone is often 
present, so many plants are found peculiar to this formation.

THE FOESTER HERBARIUM. 
By Jajies Britten, F.L.S. 

The acquisition by the Kew Herbarium of some of the plants 
collected by the Forsters in the latter half of the last century was 
made the text of an interesting article by Mr. Hemsley in ' Nature ' 
for Sept. 24. The article, however, seemed to me to require 
supplementing, inasmuch as Mr. Hemsley gave a somewhat 
erroneous impression as to our previous knowledge of these plants. 
I therefore wrote to ' Nature,' pointing out certain particulars 
which I thought should be placed on record. The Editor declmed 
to insert my letter, and I print it here.* 

Mr. Hemsley's article is as follows : — 
" Botanists will learn with pleasure that this herbarium, a 
portion of the collections of Cook's second voyage, has been 
acquired by exchange from the Liverpool Corporation for the Kew 
Herbarium ; and it will be incorporated in the general collection. 
From the introduction to the ' Catalogue of Plants ' in the Botanic 
Gardens at Liverpool, published in 1808, it appears that the pro- 
prietors of that establishment possessed, at that date, about 3000 
specimens of dried plants, collected by the late Dr. Forster, in his 
voyages to the South Seas, with large and valuable contributions 
from his friends and correspondents. How these plants came into 
their possession is uncertain, but they could hardly have been 
presented to them by Mr. Shepherd, the Curator, as stated by Sir 
Joseph Hooker in the introductory essay to his ' Flora Novg3- 
Zelandiffi,' or his name would almost certainly have been men- 
tioned as the donor. At least this may be inferred, because on the 
very next page a very high tribute is paid to Mr. John Shepherd 
for his services to the Garden. Be that as it may, the collection 
will shortly be accessible to botanists generally, thanks to the per- 
severance of Sir Jose]5h Hooker and the sensible view of the 
matter taken by the present members of the Corporation when it 
was represented to them that these dried plants where practically 
useless where they were, but would be valuable at a botanical 
establishment like Kew. This act of the Corporation deserves to 
be recorded, because some thirty years ago, when Sir Joseph 
Hooker was engaged on his ' Flora Novae -Z elan diie,' he applied to 
the then custodians of the collections to transmit it temporarily to 
Kew for comparison and publication, and his request was refused. 

* Mr. Carruthei's has before called attention (Journ. Bot. 1880, p. 35, 
footnote) to the action of the Editor of ' Nature ' in matters of this kind. 



THE FORSTER HERBARIUM. 861 

" Botanical investigations in connection with the ' Challenger ' 
Expedition again brought to mind the existence of this interesting 
collection at Liverpool, and it was determined to make another 
effort to rescue it from oblivion, which was fortunately successful. 
A few words respecting the botanical collection of Cook's voyages 
generally, and of this one in particular, will be welcome to those 
interested in botany. Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander accom- 
panied Capt. Cook on his first voyage round the world ; John 
Eeinhold Forster and George Forster, father and son, were the 
botanists of the second voyage (1772-75) ; and Mr. Anderson, the 
surgeon of the expedition, collected a little on the third voyage. 
From a statement in Sparmann's ' Travels in South Africa,' it 
seems that Forster the elder undertook the duties of naturalist to 
the expedition for the sura of £4000, and he took his son with him, 
then only seventeen years old, as an assistant. On arriving at the 
Cape of Good Hope they fell in with Sparmann, who, at the 
instance and expense of Forster, was added to the scientific staff, 
and continued with them until the return to the Cape in 1775. 
Considerable collections of plants were made in New Zealand, 
many parts of Polynesia, and the extreme south of America, and 
smaller collections in some of the Atlantic Islands, including 
St. Helena, Cape Verd Islands, and Canaries. On returning to 
England the Forsters soon commenced publishing the botanical 
results of the expedition, and an authenticated set of all the pub- 
lished plants at least was deposited in the British Museum. The 
Cape plants, however, which they did not publish, are apparently 
not represented there. The first botanical work, ' Characteres 
Genera Plantarum,' appeared in 1776, and the title-page bears the 
names of both father and son, and this was the only one published 
in England. For the rest, the botany was done by the son alone. 
His ' Florula Insularum Australium Prodromus ' appeared at 
Gottingen in 1786, and ' De Plantis Esculentis Insularum Oceani 
Australis ' at Berlin, in the same year, followed by ' De Plantis 
Magellanicis et x\.tlanticis,' at Gottingen, in 1787. 

" These works, we believe, constitute the whole of the published 
botany of the expedition, and, though very meagre, are extremely 
interesting, being the foundation of our knowledge of New Zealand, 
Antarctic, and Polynesian vegetation. 

" The collection now acquired for Kew is excellently preserved, 
and the plants mostly named and localised. It comprises altogether 
1359 species, 785 of which were collected on the voyage with 
Cook, and the rest, from various parts of the world, are probably 
some of those alluded to above as having been presented to Forster 
by his friends. 

" The collection includes a large proportion of the plants pub- 
lished by the Forsters, but it is not complete. Eoughly, there are 
187 species from Polynesia, 119 from New Zealand, 21 from the 
extreme south of America, 23 from the Atlantic Islands, including 
all those described by Forster from St. Helena, and 9 from Aus- 
tralia. Besides the foregoing, which are all phanerogams, there 
are 36 ferns, but they include only a small portion of the species 
described by Forster." 



362 THE FORSTER HERBARIUM. 

The following is the letter which I wrote to ' Nature,' and 
which was refused insertion : — 

"It is gratifying to learn that the Kew Herbarium lias acquired 
from Liverpool a collection of plants made by the Forsters during 
Cook's second voyage. But I think these plants are much more 
widely distributed than Mr. Hemsley seems to imply. Laseguc 
mentions Forster's plants as existing in the herbaria of Sir W. J. 
Hooker, Vienna and Lcyden ; and DeCandolle (' Phytographic,' 
p. 412), states that there are " un grand nombre d'echant. de 
I'expedition autour du monde dans I'herbier de I'Univ. de Kiel," and 
others in the Paris Museum. 

" At the British Museum we have the -herbarium of G. Forster, 
purchased at Lambert's sale, which David Don describes as ' the 
entire Herbarium of George Forster, collected during Cook's 
circumnavigation, and from which he published his 'Florula of 
South Sea plants' (Appendix to Lambert's ' Pinus,' p. 28) ; and 
sets from other localities visited diiring the voyage, and presented 
by the Forsters to Sir Joseph Banks. Some, at any rate, of these 
seem more extensive than those received at Kew, e.g., the latter 
collection contains ' roughly .... 23 from the Atlantic Islands ' ; 
whereas the list of plants sent to Banks by the Forsters contains 
78 species from Madeira alone. Our collection of ferns is also 
much more extensive. Mr. Hemsley says, ' The Cape plants .... 
are apparently not represented in the museum ' ; but we have a list 
of 85 species presented to Banks by the Forsters, the specimens 
corresponding with which are in the National Herbarium. 

"We have also a large collection of drawings — 301 in all — of the 
plants collected by G. Forster during the voyage." 

Besides the plants referred to above, we have in the Museum a 
third set, included in the Herbarium of Pallas, which was also 
purchased at Lambert's sale, and of which an interesting account 
was published by Lambert in Trans. Linn, Soc. x. 256-265. He 
says, " George Forster .... sent to Pallas fine specimens of all 
the plants gathered during his voyage with Cook. I find several 
species here not in his own herbarium which I purchased some 
years ago from his father-in-law. Professor Heyne." There is also 
a fourth set, comprising only a few specimens mounted on small 
paper and endorsed " G. Forster's little Herbarium." 

There would seem to be some confusion as to G. Forster's own 
herbarium. Although D. Don describes the collection in Heyne's 
possession as " the entire Herbarium of G. Forster," the preceding 
rema]-k of Lambert shows that it did not contain all the plants 
collected by him.- Moreover, writing to Banks from Cassel, Nov. 
26, 1780, he says, " We know not whether you were ever informed 
that, on my quitting England, my books, instruments, curiosities 
and herbal, were embarked on board a Hamburg trader, which 
was lost on the coast of Jutland. My chests were saved, it is true; 
but, owing to my great misfortune, when I received them here, 
their contents were all thoroughly rotten ; so that the expense 

* The number of species contained in it was 453. 



THE FORSTER HERBARIUM. OOO 

of carriage hither as well as the charge of saving them from the 
wreck were a dead loss. The loss of my herbal has never been 
replaced, as I had in it most of those specimens of which there are 
now no duplicates, except those which j^oii had from us at the 
revision of our herbals." (MSS. Banksian Correspondence, i. 309). 

This " revision of herbals " took place in 1778 ; we have a list 
in Sir Joseph Banks's handwriting headed, "List of plants given 
me by Messrs. Forsters when I looked at their specimens in Jan. 1778 
and compared them with my Herbarium." This list contains about 
236 species, of which 85 are from the Cape ; another list enume- 
rates 78 from Madeira ; and there is also a ' Catalogue of a collec- 
tion of plants presented to Joseph Banks, Esq., by John Eeinhold 
Forster and George Forster ' (in the handwriting of the former), 
in which 255 species are enumerated, 19, however, being " blank 
or wanting in this Herbal C." 

It may be of interest to transcribe a note by Kobert Brown, 
which is among the MSS. in the Botanical Department of the 
British Museum. It is a copy of a memorandum by Banks, and 
Brown appends to it — " Copied March 9th, 1828, having obtained 
leave the same day to do so from Sir Edward Knatchbull, to whom 
I delivered it, along with the portrait of Captain Cook, Sir J. 
Banks's diplomas, and several other things of smaller importance." 
The note runs thus:— "John Eeynhold Forster and George his son 
embarked in the year 1772 on board the ' Eesolution,' Capt. Cook, 
bound to the South Seas on discovery, sent by the Board of 
Admiralty ; the father as naturalist and the son as his assistant, in 
my room when I was disappointed of my anxious desire of under- 
taldng that voyage, by the machinations of Sir Hugh Palliser, the 
Comptroller of the Navy. For their reward they had 4000 pounds, 
which at my desire was voted by the House of Commons to enable 
Dr. Jas. Lind, of Edinburgh, M.D., to accompany me ; but the vote 
having passed in vague terms it was thought proper to apply it to the 
benefit of the voyage of discovery in that manner. On their return 
they did me the favour to present me with very many specimens, 
both of plants and animals which they had collected in the different 
countries they had visited. In the year 1776 I purchased of them, 
for 400 pounds, all the drawings of animals and plants which they 
had made in the course of the voyage," J. E. Forster's letter 
('Banksian Correspondence,' i. 132), dated Jan. 9, 1776, speaks of 
the sum offered by Banks as four hundred guineas. 

The drawings are in various stages of completeness, some being 
coloured throughout, others in part, and others merely pencil 
sketches, some of them very incomplete. They are localised and 
dated by Forster and named by Solander. Among them are the 
originals of the plates illustrating G. Forster's ' Fasciculus Plant- 
arum Magellanicarum ' in Comment. Soc. Getting, ix. (1789). 
From them were prepared a number of copper-plates, of which 
Pritzel says, " Icones plantarum in itinere ad insulas novis aus- 
tralis coUectorum ineditte 130 tabulae senere in folio, fuerunt olim 
in Bibl. Lambertiana." This copy is described in the Catalogue of 
Lambert's sale (April 19, 1842), as containing 131 plates, "in

2 vols, royal 4to, calf"; it was bought by Mr. Bolm for £1 12s. I 
have met with no reference to any other copy, but we have in the 
Botanical Department a similar volume, containing 129 plates, all 
written up by Solander with reference to the place where the plants 
were published, which was for the great majority Gr. Forster's 
' Prodromus.' The plates are all in a very unfinished state. I can 
find no reference to these copper-plates, either in the ' Banksian 
Correspondence,' or in the works of either of the Forsters. George, 
in his preface to the ' Prodromus,' speaks of the figures — mere 
details of flowers — published in the ' Characteres,' but does not 
refer to any larger work, such as must have been projected. 

There are numerous letters from and concerning both the 
Forsters in the ' Banksian Correspondence,' but these do not throw 
much light upon their botanical work. It may be worth while to 
reproduce, from Eees's ' Cycloptedia,' the account of the father : — 

" Forster, John Keinhold, an eminent naturalist and philo- 
logist, was the son of a burgomaster at Dirschaw, in Polish 
Prussia, where he was born October 22nd, in the year 1729. In 
early youth he had few advantages for education ; but about the 
age of fifteen years he was admitted into the Gymnasium of 
Joachimsthal at Berlin. Under the tuition of Menzelius and 
Heinsius he made considerable progress in the learned languages ; 
and he also devoted a part of his attention to the study of the 
Coptic, and to the acquisition of several of the modern languages, 
and particularly the Polish. In the year 1748 he was entered at 
the University of Halle, where he studied Theology, and continued 
his application to the learned languages, among which he com- 
prehended the Oriental. After three years he removed to Dantzic, 
and distinguished himself as a preacher, imitating the French 
rather than the Dutch manner ; and in 1755 he obtained a settle- 
ment at Nassenhuben. In the following year he married his 
cousin, Elizabeth Nikolai. During his residence in this place, he 
employed his leisure hours in the study of philosophy, geography, 
and the mathematics, without desisting from further improvements 
in his acquintance with the ancient and modern languages. With 
a small income and increasing family, the difliculties he experienced 
induced him to accept the proposal of removing to Eussia, in order 
to superintend the new colonies at Saratow. Much, however, as 
he was approved, during an interview with the members of Govern- 
ment at Petersburg, some circumstances occurred which rendered 
his new appointment of short duration ; but on his return to the 
capital, advantageous offers were made to him by the Academy of 
Sciences, and by that of Moscow, both which he thought proper to 
decline. Having for some time indulged unavaihng expectations 
from the Eussian Government, he removed to London in the year 
17GG, with strong recommendations, but with very little money. 
After his arrival, he received from the Government of Eussia a 
present of 100 guineas ; and he also made an addition to his stock 
by the translation of ' Kalm's Travels ' and ' Osbeck's Voyage.' At 
this time Lord Baltimore proposed to him a settlement in America, 
as superintendent of his extensive property in that country, but he

preferred the place of teacher of the French, German and Natural 
History, m the dissentmg academy at Warrington. This situation, 
however, he soon abandoned, and returning to London, he was 
engaged, in the year 1772, to accompany Captain Cook, as a 
naturalist, in his second voyage round the world. At this time he 
was 48 years of age, and his son George, who went with him, was 
17. Upon his return to England in 1775, the University of 
Oxford conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws. At this 
time he was projecting, with the assistance of his son, a botanical 
work in Latin, containing the characters of many new genera 
of plants, which they had discovered in the course of their voyage. 
An account of the voyage having been published by his son in 
English and German, the father was supposed to have had a con- 
siderable share in it ; and as he had entered into an engagement 
not to publish anything separately from the authorized narrative, 
he thus incurred the displeasiu-e of Government, and gave offence 
to his friends. Independently of the violation of his engagements, 
he was also chargeable with having introduced into his work 
several reflections on the Government which appointed and also on 
the navigators who conducted the expedition. The father and sou, 
finding that, in consequence of those circumstances, their situation 
in London was become unpleasant, determined to quit England. 
Before the execution of their purpose, their condition became 
embarrassed and distressing ; but happily for Mr. Forster, he was 
invited, in 1780, to be Professor of Natural History at Halle ; he 
was also appomted Inspector of the Botanical Garden, and in the 
following year he obtained the degree of M.D. His health, how- 
ever, began to decline, and the death of his son George so deeply 
impressed his mind as to aggravate his other complaints. Towards 
the commencement of the year 1798 his case became desperate ; 
and before the close of this year, viz., on the 9th of December, his 
life terminated, at the age of 69 years and some months. Mr. 
Forster' s disposition was, unfortunately for his happiness and 
reputation, extremely irritable and litigious, and his want of 
prudence involved him in perpetual difdculties." 

It is evident, from this account, that J. E. Forster was a man 
of very varied attainments and great energy ; the ' Banksian 
Correspondence ' contains abundant evidence that the judgment 
passed upon him in the last sentence is a correct one. His 
dedication to Solander of the ' Flora Americse Septentrionalis ' is 
couched in terms so flattering as to be fulsome. Forster con- 
sidered he had been unfairly treated by Cook ; and from his own 
statement of the case, as detailed in a long letter to Banks (not 
dated, but apparently written in 1778), it would seem that he had 
some ground for his belief. It would certainly appear, from the 
following passage in a letter from Solander to Banks, dated Sept. 5, 
1755, — which I cite because it gives a contemporary opinion of 
Forster's character,— that it was at any rate contemplated that 
Forster should be part author of the account of the voyage.

He certainly has made some clever remarks during the voyage ; but 
he talks rather too much of them. You cannot imagine how much 
the man is mended since he came home ; the officers say they 
hardly know the man. He came home thinking himself very 
great ; now he, like Bruce, is reduced, even in his own opinion. 
Some days ago he desired me to call upon him, and he then 
desired me to pick out of his insects two of each species, one for 
you and one for the Museum, which I did not think proper to 
refuse. He has very few indeed from the South Seas, but some 
very fine ones from the Cape. I believe I told you before, that in 
the rest you are to be the third sharer : 1st, Br. Mus. ; 2nd, Eoy. 
Socy. ; 3rd, Banks ; 4th, Tunstal ; 5th, Lever, &c. 

" Ld. Sandwich has desired him to, by way of specimen, send 
in some sheets, containing an account of what happened at Dusky 
Bay, New Zealand. If approved of, he is to write the account of 
the Voyage, and he is to have ^ the profits, and ^ to Captn. Cook." 
The manuscript, when sent in, was rejected by Lord Sandwich, 
"without alledging any other ostensible reason than the general 
expression, it would not do ; " and Forster further adds, that the 
same nobleman " had already represented [him] to His Majesty as 
an obstinate, violent, and impracticable man, instead of recom- 
mending me to the King according to his promise." He certainly 
seems to have met with an unfavourable reception at court, and he 
attributes this to the action of Sandwich. He considers he fell 
under Sandwich's displeasure on account of a circumstance which 
he thus narrates : — "I bought at the Cape of Good Hope various 
live animals in order to present them to Her Majesty, to the 
amount of 200 f. When I arrived in England, Lord Sandwich 
came on board the ' Eesolution,' accompanied by Miss Eay. She 
saw the animals, and repeatedly told my servant she wished to have 
them ; but my man told her they were destined for Her Majesty, 
but I am sure had I preferred Lord Sandwich's mistress to the 
King's royal consort I would have done better ; whereas, now I 
have brought upon me the noble lord's odium." The whole letter is 
of interest, but too long for transcription ; it occupies pp. 171-181 
of vol. i. of the ' Banksian Correspondence.' A letter, dated Sept. 
26, 1778, shows that Forster did not despair of obtaining some 
payment from the Government : in it he writes : — 

" I have proposed Lord North a plan for sending 20 millions 
sterl., without taxing the public. I begged only secrecy in case my 
plan were rejected, and I stipulated a sum and an annuity if it were 
adopted. His secretary, Mr. Robinson, tells me in his letter that it 
is not usual to make stipulations, and promises that my plan shall 
be examined with candour and due attention, if I will give it to 
Ld. North without promising me the least reward. But I have 
some notion that Lord North will not be long at the head of the 
Treasury ; and I shall reserve my j)lan for his successor, to whom 
I can likewise offer £10,000 from a foreign Prince. You'll think me 
crazy talking in such a strain, but it is all fact." It would be in- 
teresting to know how Banks replied to this proposal. 

George Forster seems to have resembled his father in many 



THE FORSTER HERBARIUM. 367 

respects. Of his earlier work his father gives the following account in 
dedicating to him his ' Enchiridion ' (1788) : — 

" Tandem decimo a3tatis tua3 anno exacto, mccum iter in Rossiam

Of his life after their return to England, Eees gives the follow- 
ing sketch : — 

" On leaving England, he wished to settle at Paris. After a 
temporary residence in that city, he removed, in the year 1779, to 
Cassel, and undertook the office of Professor of Natural History in 
the University of that place. He afterwards accepted the offer of 
a chair in the University of Wilna, but found no permanent satis- 
faction in a country where liberty was expiring under the intrigues 
of Eussia and Prussia. Desirous of a retreat, he entered into a 
treaty with Catherine II., who projected a voyage of discovery round 
the world ; but the proposed expedition was prevented by a war 
with the Ottoman Porte ; and thus the hopes of Forster were 
frustrated. His active mind, however, led him to wish for useful 
employment, and the reputation which he had acquired induced the 
Elector of Mentz to appoint him President of the University of 
that city. He hailed the dawnings of the French Eevolution, 
says M. Pongens, little apprehending, we may say, the clouds that 
subsequently overshadowed them ; and he was deputed by the 
people of Mentz, who had formed themselves into a convention, to 
repair to Paris, and to request that they miglit be invited to the 
French Eepublic. But while he was thus employed, the city of 
Mentz was besieged and taken by the Prussian troops. By this 
disaster he lost his whole property, and his numerous MSS., which 



868 A NEW CHINESE SALVIA. 

fell into the hands of the Prince of Prussia. The domestic un- 
easiness of a conjugal kind, which he afterwards experienced, led 
him to form a resolution of visiting Hindoostan and Thibet, for 
which he acquired the necessary preparation, by studying the 
Oriental languages, but the chagrin occasioned by his misfortunes 
aggravating a scorbutic affection, which he had contracted during 
his voyage round the world, prevented the accomplishment of his 
purpose by terminating his existence, which event took place at 
Paris, February 15th, 1792." 

Papers like the present, if of no great importance in them- 
selves, may have the effect of inducing botanists to realise that 
there exists in the Department of Botany of the British Museum a 
vast store of material which is comparatively unknown and un- 
consulted, but which is readily accessible and of historical im- 
portance. From time to time evidence of this has been brought 
forward in this Journal. Mr. Hemsley's paper " On Bermuda plants 
in the Sloane Collection " (Journ. Bot. 1883, 257), and my own on 
Masson's collection of plants and drawings (Journ. Bot. 1884, 
114, 144), may be cited as examples ; while Mr. Jenman has 
recently examined the Ferns of Sloane's Jamaica Herbarium, with 
interesting results which will be published in the January number.

SHOET NOTES. 

The Charace^ of ' English Botany,' ed. hi. — In the review of 
the above-named work (p. 350) the Messrs. Groves seem to me to 
have been rather severe in their criticism. They say : — " Under 
N. nidifica Mr. Brown did not happen to see the difference between 
plants which Braun liad distinguished, so he had no doubt Braun 
was wrong, and wrote, ' The nucules examined by Braun must have 
been quite immature ones.' As if Prof. Braun did not know unripe 
nucules when he saw them!" Now Braun himself (' Fragmenta 
einer Monographie der Characeen,' p. 94) writes, '' Tolypella nidifica 
forma intermedia, — . . . . Semina .... unreif." And a few lines 
later he again says — "Antheridien habe ich niclit gesehen. Spo- 
rangia unreif." For the Messrs. Groves to have overlooked Braun's 
statement that the nucules were miripe is altogether inexcusable, as 
Mr. Brown devotes six lines of text to a translation of what Braun 
says. And if Mr. Brown did consider it "questionable whether N. 
nidifica and N. glomerata are more than varieties of each other," 
yet he kept them distinct, and left the matter subjudice till the plant 
should " again be found in the British Isles." And Braun himself 
admitted that he was doubtful to which of the two his ''forma 
intermedia" was most allied. Ecspectiug the absence of nucules 
from Borrer's Lancing specimen of X. (jlomerata var. SmitJiii, Mr. 
Brown is certainly wrong. I have examined a small branch of this 
specimen, and find very young nucules present ; but it requires a 
magnification of 150 diameters to make out clearly that they are 
nucules. The specimen is in a very young state ; the best developed 
nucule I found being in the condition represented in Sachs' ' Text- 
book,' ed. i., fig. 208 (ed. 2, fig, 201). I could not find them at all 
on some branchlets. The blunder may be '• inexcusable," but Mr. 
Brown is not the first to make it. The specimen is figured in 
Sowerby's ' English Botany,' t. 1708. Sowerby found no nucules, 
so added a fragment from another plant (from Cley) to show a 
nucule. Sir James E. Smith (in the description) says, "no germens 
[nucules] could be found." Borrer (Engl. Bot. Suppl. sub t. 2762, 
correcting an error as to the locality of the Lancing specimen) 
states, "no nucules were produced." It is clear that these authors 
are wrong, and it is also satisfactory to be able to clear up a 
batch of blunders. But I think it would have been better to 
have left the reference to "intense egotism" out of the question. 

E. A. EoLFE. 

With Mr. Eolfe's permission, the Editor has shown us the above 
note. Had we overlooked Braun's statement that the nucules in 
question were unripe, it would certainly have been inexcusable ; 
but we had not, and Mr. Eolfe has altogether misapprehended the 
object of our remarks as to Mr. Brown in connection with A^ 
nidifica. To make the matter quite clear, we now quote Mr. Brown 
at greater length, with reference to the Lough Neagh plant : — " A 
very careful examination of this specimen with N. nidijica and X. 
ylumerata, however, has not corroborated what Braun has stated. 

Journal of Botany. — Vol. 23. [Dec, 1885.] 2 b 



370 SHOKT NOTES. 

A comparison under the microscope, side by side with typical 
specimens of N. nidijica from the Baltic, named by Profs. I3raun 
and Nordstedt, has failed to disclose the least difl'ereuce between 
them. The nucules examined by Braun must have been quite 
immature ones, which are the most numerous on the specimen, but 
there are a few which appear to have attained their full growth ; 
and these are neither smaller nor more contorted than those of iV. 
nidijic<t, and appear to be only 7-8striate, as in N. nidijica, not 
10-striate, as stated." Now, the only meaning we can attach to 
this is that the writer imagined that Braun did not know immature 
nucules when he saw them, otherwise it could not have been 
assumed that he must have examined " quite immature ones,', 
when there were, on the same specimen, some which appeared to 
have attained their full growth. It will be clearly seen that we 
were referring to Mr. Brown's manner of writing, and not (as Mr. 
Bolfe assumes) to the facts dealt with, or we should have pointed 
out the impossibility of "quite immature" nucules showing more 
striae than full-grown ones. By the reference to the difference 
between A', (jiomerata and N. nidijica it is evident that Mr. Kolfe 
does not understand the question at issue — Braun distingv;ished the 
Lough Neagh plant (forma intermedia) from typical N. nidijica, and 
Mr. Brown (not having Prof. Braun's experience in examining 
Chai'as) could not see the difference ; and so, as in other cases, he 
unhesitatingly discarded Braun's conclusions in a manner that we 
considered both oft'hand and egotistic. With regard to the N. 
Smithii, we certainly should not have considered Mr. Brown's 
overlooking the nucules inexcusable had he not stated that he had 
"very carefully examined" the specimen, and could not find even 
"a trace of a nucule." — Henry & James Groves. 

Notes on British Eubi.— Mr. J. G. Baker, on looking over the 
unnamed brambles in the British Museum Herbarium, has called 
my attention to the following rare forms collected by me a few 
years ago : — Bubus hemistemo7i Mull. Foot of a stone wall, Maes-y- 
brynor, Dolgelley, Merionethshire. This species is only previously 
recorded from the counties of North Devon, AVarwick, Cardigan, 
and Aberdeen. — Irl. (near incnrvatm). Koadside near St. Dogmells, 
Pembroke, August, 1882. This plant is identical with that alluded 
to in Mr. Baker's Flora of the Lake District, under 11. rhaninifuliiis 
(p. 81), as occurring at Watermillock and near Ulleswater and 
Haweswater. • — E. saltunmi'oclie [li. 6^»»;/(tvi of British botanists). 
On the banks of the Wye, at the foot of the Scaur, Moccas, Here- 
fordshire. In Samuel Dale's collection there is a specimen of 
R. thyrsoideus Bell., labelled " Bulnis Morns Merret, Pin. lOG, said by 
Dr. Merret to grow at Sutton, in Essex, Avherethoy call it Mulberry 
Bramble." This makes it clear what form was intended by Merret 
under this name. — H. N. Ridley.

The Botanical Exchange Chib of the British Isles. Eeport for 1883 
[by G. Nicholson] . Eeport for 1884 [by Arthur Bennett] . 
Manchester: printed by James Collins & Co., King Street. 
1885. 
We are glad to welcome two more Keports of the Botanical 
Exchange Club, albeit their appearance is somewhat late. And 
we are glad to note, too — of course assuming that the existence of 
our rarer plants is in no way endangered thereby — that there 
seems no lack of energy among the member's of the Club ; the total 
number of plants received for distribution being, in 1883, 3735, 
from 33 contributors, and in 1884, 4371, from 27 contributors. 
Dr. Boswell's state of health has precluded him fi-om supplying 
any notes ; but Messrs. Nicholson and Bennett have worked hard 
to supply the absence of these, the latter having received much 
help from Dr. Focke, of Bremen, in naming the Bubi, as well as 
from other foreign botanists. Among the most generous of the 
contributors we notice the Kevs. E. F. & W. K. Linton, compara- 
tively recent members of the Club ; and it is pleasant to note the 
return of the Rev. H. E. Fox to his old love, as further indicated 
in the pages of our present volume. The entire absence of Irish 
plants from the Eeports is remarkable, inasmuch as Ireland 
possesses in Mr. H. C. Hart and Mr. E. M. Barrington — not to 
mention Mr. A. G. More, whose official duties perhaps interfere 
with his researches into the Irish Flora — energetic and painstaking 
field-botanists. 

Although containing not very much which will be new to the 
readers of this Journal, the Eeports afford a series of texts on 
which we are tempted to offer a few remarks. It must, of course, 
be borne in mind that each Eeport is primarily intended to be read 
in connection with the sets of specimens distributed by the Club, 
and this explains the presence in it of certain remarks which are 
somewhat wanting in general interest— such, for example, as the 



372 NOTICES OF BOOKS. 

mistaldng of " simply a proliferous state of Trifolium rqjens " for a 
monstrosity of Lotus major. It explains, too, what looks like a 
wild confusion of names and opinions wlien the Euhi come to be 
dealt with. "Tot homines quot sententi^e " rises in our mind 
as we glance down the pages devoted to brambles ; but a closer 
examination shows an agreement m many cases between authorities 
such as Dr. Focke and Prof. Babington ; and as these eminent 
men do not hesitate to differ when occasion demands, their con- 
current determinations are especially satisfactory. Mr. Bennett 
has done well to secure Dr. Focke's help, which gives the Keport a 
special value. 

While so much confusion exists as to the plants themselves, it 
is hardly to be expected that the nomenclature will be satisfactorily 
established. We note that lluhus jn/ramidalis Bab. is placed by 
Dr. Focke as a synonym of II. longitliyrsigcr Lees, there being an 
earlier jyuramidalis of Kaltenbach. By the reference to "Babington, 
Journal of Botany, 1878, p. 177," our own issue of that date is 
intended, in which Prof. Babington points out the necessity of this 
substitution. But we sought in vain for the name in Mr. Edwin 
Lees' published writings upon Faibi, and at length found it in 
Babington's 'British Eubi,' where '' R. longithyrsiger Lees! MS. 
(184:9) " is cited under II. pi/raviidalis. The name, existing only in 
MS. until printed as a synonym by Babington, is very properly 
ignored by Nyman ; but it would seem that it must now take its 
position as the name of the plant, owing to its publication in 
' Brit. Eubi.' The citation " R. lonrjithyrsu/er Lees " certainly is 
very inconvenient, inasmuch as his published papers contain no 
reference to it ; but if the publisher of the name be taken as the 
authority and we read " li. longithyrsiger Bab.," we at once find it 
in the index to ' British Kubi.' Our readers may remember that 
this point was discussed at some length in this Journal for 1882 
(pp. 53, 104, 173, 238).* 

The Koses are nearly as bad as the Ruhi ; fortunately botanists 
are not a belligerent race, or the differences revealed in the fol- 
lowing notes from the 1884 Eeport (which are interesting enoiigh to 
reproduce) on two Eoses might lead to serious consequences : — 

* It seems doubtful whether R. suberectus Andei'son (Linn. Trans, xi. 218 
(1815) should not give place to R. negsensis Hall (Trans. Boy. Soc. Edin. iii. 
pt. i. 20 (1794). Anderson says his i^lant is " the same that was brought by Mr. 
Hall from the banks of Loch Ness, and so accurately described by him," and 
adds " the impropriety of Mr. Hall's specific name will, I hope, be a sufficient 
excuse for my changing it." Prof. Babington says "it may reasonably be 
doubted if R. yuherectus is the nesseiisia of Hall" (Brit. Kubi, p. 51) ; but he 
does not seem to have seen Hall's specimens, and we do not know if these exist. 
Anderson, however, seems to have had no doubt about the identity of the two, 
and Smith (E. B. 2572) accepts his view. It may be noted that the " specimen 
in the Banksian Herbarium, sent from four miles north-west from Manchester," 
was forwarded to Banks by his protege George Caley, in whose handwriting is a 
ticket further defining the locality as " a valley in Pembury." The specimen 
from E. Forster's herbarium said by Prof. Babington to be "named by Ander- 
son" (Brit. Eubi, 53) was named by Forster and confirmed by Smith (who 
notes on Caley's specimen, " Seems Rubus conjlifoUus (Fl. Brit.) " : it was sent 
by Anderson, but not named by him, so that it is not strictly a type.

Club fruiting specimens of this rose, which had been determined

to settle the question. These are now supplied.' — J. W. White.

typical R sepium of Thuillier's M. des Env. de Paris, which work 
I know, and the description of R. sejnum has " fructibus oblongo- 
ovatis.'" — T. E. Archer Briggs. Passed by Mr. J. Gr. Baker. This, 
as Mr. Briggs rightly remarks, has not the fruit of the original 
sepium, but it seems best placed under it ; it is less different than a 
curious form that occurs in Surrey, which M. Crepin seems inclined 
to refer to a rare continental species, but which has all the essential 
general characters and growth of sepium.. Herr von Uechtritz, to 
whom I sent Surrey examples of this form, considered it repre- 
sented Thuillier's ' sepium, inodor a, Fr.,' but I cannot agree with 
him in either reference, but at present I know not what name to 
give these Surrey specimens." 

Another puzzling group of plants, the Hieracia, is being taken 
up energetically by the Messrs. Linton, who send " a fine series " 
each year, and to whom we would venture to suggest that a set 
should be placed in the British collection of the National Herbarium 
at South Kensington, so as to be available for public reference. 

One lesson to be learnt from the Eeports is that greater care is 
requisite in applying the names of continental forms. Many 
names have crept into our books on grounds which we fear would 
hardly be tenable if the plants to which they have been assigned 
could be compared with the types : and several of these are cor- 
rected in the Eeports. Perhaps Mr. Bennett carries caution a 
little too far when, apropos of a plant named by Mr. Beeby Care.v 
xanthocarp)a, he says, "I think he is probably correct, but I have 
not seen a type-specimen of Degland's plant, and in Carices I 
should decline to name any specimen decisively until I had." But 
the error, if error there be, is on the right side. 

We notice that Mr, Bennett adopts an unusual spelling — 
Goodenourjhii — for the specific name of the Carex which British 
authors write Goodenovii; the strictly accurate spelling, however, 
is Goodenowii, that being the form of the word employed by Gay in 
establishing the species (Ann. Sci. Nat. 2nd s. xi. 191 (1839) ). 
Mr. Bennett points out that Goodenough's name teretiuscula (1794) 
is ante-dated by Eoth, who (in 1788) called the plant C. diandra : 
according to Nyman, however, who sets it aside as " nomen 
erroneum," the name is to be attributed to Schrank (1781). 

A large number of typographical errors mar the appearance and

sometimes — if, as we suppose, " Ponning, Berks" (1883, p. 98) is 
intended for "Sonning" — the sense. Surely "ordinary seaside 
Geraniiihi liuhertiamun " is not the same as G. purpureum Forst. 
(p. 85) ? And in other ways the Keports bear evidence of hasty 
revision: e.;/., the note on Scirjmti uniijlnmh (1884, 116) is not 
intelhgible. 

We have never been able to fathom the exact meaning of the 
" non-natural " sense in vs^hich the w^ord " new " is employed either 
by the Exchange or Eecord Club. In the 1883 Keport, the Hawk- 
hurst locality for Dentaria is called a " new station," with a reference 
to this Journal for 1882. If published in 1882, we do not see how 
the station can be styled "new" in 1885, especially as the record 
in Journ. Bot. (p. 185) mentions an earlier gathering in 1872. 
More puzzling still is the placing of Pohjuola ruliico-is from Bucks as 
a " new County Eecord " in the 1884 Eeport : this plant is duly 
given for Bucks in ' Top. Bot.,' and if we suppose a misprint and 
that P. calcarea was intended, that species is recorded for the county 
in Journ. Bot. 1878, p. 54. The "New County Eecords " in the 
1883 Eeport consist almost entirely of Mr. Beeby's S. Lincoln and 
Surrey plants and the Hunts plants of the Eev. W. E. Linton — all 
of which have been duly recorded in our pages. 

The following are the more interesting portions of the Eeports 
— the Eubi, Koses, and Hieracia excepted : — 

From Eeport for 1883. 

" Gentiana ijermcmica Willd. Chalky banks, Crowell Hill, Oxon, 
Sept., 1883. Crowell Hill is one of the Chiltern range, and within 
two miles of the Bucks border. The plant occurred abundantly on 
very bare chalky slopes, but, although extremely variable in size 
and number of flowers, yet the size of flowers seemed fairly 
constant. I did not notice any great difference in size of corolla 
lobes, nor did the length of germen seem worth consideration. 
The leaves are broader than those of AmareUa, and the colour 
considerably lighter, more blue than purple, and often lilac. G. 
AmareUa grew with it plentifully, but it required persistent search 
to find one in flower, whereas G. germanica was in profuse blossom, 
scarcely over its prime. There must be ten days diflerence in the 
time of flowermg of the two plants. A few plants were found with 
only four lobes to the corolla. While in the greatest abundance on 
slopes of almost bare chalk, still others were scattered in the grass, 
and some few were found on the tertiary above the chalk. This 
hill yields, in its only Oxford locality, Cejihalanthera nmfolia. 
Gentiana yennanica had not previously been recorded for Oxford. — 
G. C. Druce" (p. 92). 

" Scutellaria galericulata X minor. Virginia Water, Surrey, July 
and August, 1883. — Geo. Nicholson. I think there can be little 
doubt of this being a hybrid. It grows in considerable quantity at 
the station named, occurring in both Berkshire and Surrey. Dr. 
Focke, who has made a special study of plant hybrids, says ' In- 
termediate between S. (jalericulata and .6'. ndnur ; probably a 
hybrid.' The only hybrid Scutellaria mentioned in Dr. Focke's

tunity of examining, in the Paris Herbarium, a type-specimen of 
S. minori-galericulata Michalet (Notice sur quelques plantes recem- 
ment observees dans le departement du Jura et le pays de Gex) 
the description of which seems to have escaped Dr. Focke. This 
plant comes nearer 8. (jalericulata than any of those distributed to 
the Club " (p. 93). 

" Mijosutis alpefitris Sehmidt. Ben Lawers, Perth, 3700 ft., 
July 31, 1882. — Kevs. W. K. Linton and E. F. Linton, the latter 
sending the following note respecting the new record for Forfar : — 
From the foot of wet rocks in one of the western glens of the Clova 
Mountains, Forfar, Aug. 3, 1883. The Eev, H. E. Fox and myself 
found very little, and had to be chary m what we took, though we 
were not aware at the time that it was unrecorded for Forfar. 
Probably there was more on the wall of rocks above us, still we 
could not see it " (p. 93). [Some reference should have been made 
to Dr. Buchanan White's note on p. 26 of the ' Journal ' for this 
year, from which it appears that the plant is an introduction to this 
locality. — Ed. Journ. Bot.] 

" Jimcus lampyocarpus x acutijionis. Bog, Hedge Court, Mill- 
pond, Surrey, Sept. 9, 1883. See Eeport for 1882, Since sending 
to the Club I have sent further specimens to Dr. Buchenau, calling 
his attention to the uniform sterility of the plant ; he replies (22nd 
August, 188'1), 'From the form of the perianth, and from your 
observations, probably = J acxitijiura x lampwcarjms. Interesting, 
as hybrids are rare in this order.' — W. H. Beeby " (p. 96). 

" Ctaex vesicariah. var. ? or hybrid with ainpullacea / By Wire 
Mill Pond, Surrey, June 10, 1883. Almost or quite sterile. The 
very few (apparently perfect) nuts that I have been able to find 
resemble those of C. vesicaria, but are smaller. The leaves are 
those of robust vesicaria, but the perigynium shows considerable 
approach to (unpullacca. I cannot detect the latter plant (6'. vesi- 
caria is abundant) in the immediate vicinity, but it occurs within a 
few miles. The plant was of a very dark, somewhat translucent, 
green. — W. H. Beeby" (p. 98).

(M, J. Lloyd, of Nantes). This is a plant that has often been 
reported as British, and as often contradicted, forms of jwlynoni- 
folins, rufesceiis, and Zizii have been mistaken for it. There seems 
no reason to doubt Mr. Fryer's specimens being the true plant ; 
they agree well with specimens in the Berlin Herbarium determined 
by Nolte and Chamisso, and with others in my own collection from 
the herbarium of the late A. Braun. I am in hopes that Mr. 
Fryer's specimens will fruit with him this year, when its identity 
will be made quite certain. Indeed, the observations of my acute 
friend almost make me feel sure ; i. e., ' its habit of growth is quite 
different from P. natans, which grows in the same pit ; of that 
roots come up freely, of this the roots strikes deep in the mud. 
All the submerged leaves are alike, down to the very bottom, linear- 
lanceolate. I can see its distinctiveness from deep-water forms of 
polygoni/olms better now I have had a second look at it growing.' 
There is one thing Mr. Fryer's specimens show, i. e., that the non- 
branching of natavs, fluitans, and jwlijr/oiiifoliits has exceptions, and 
in this I am supported by the opinion of my friend Eev. T. Morony 
[Morong] of Mass., U.S.A., who writes that 'while the rule 

here, there are exceptions.' From the usual state of 

natans it differs in the upper leaves being gradually tapered into 
the petiole, the midrib of much thicker consistence, the stipules 
blunter, the siibmerycd leaves havhig lacinue, the fruits smaller and 
more rounded. The submerged leaves, especially the young ones, 
are of very thin texture. From all stages oi polygon Ifolins it differs 
at once by the thick peduncles, larger flowers, and larger fi-uit. The 
forms it is liable to be mistaken for are : — Of natans, the var. 
prolixus of Fr. [P. serotinus Schrad.) ; and oi polyyoni/olius, the var. 
pseudo-ftuita7is of Syme. The question of the phyllodia of P. natans 
I have not yet been enabled to trace by growing specimens, but in 
specimens of a form of pulyyonifolius, watched for five years (from 
N. Wales, J. E. Griffith), I find the laminae to drop off, leaving the 
petioles, which become nearly white, but in this state are persistent 
to October and November. The leaves of this form assume a very 
natans-\ike look, much like the specimens from ' Fleet Pond, N. 
Hants,' in Mr. H. C. Watson's herbarium at Kew. It is this form 
of polyt/onifolins that is often named natans! When in fruit, how- 
ever, there is no difficulty. The distribution of P. Jiuitans Eoth. is 
not yet worked out, the barren specimens in various herbaria being 
extremely difficult to separate from some others " (pp. Ill, 112).

I have had this growing with jn-alongus and rufescens for three 
years ; its growth is much slower than either, and it does not die 
down during the winter, the upper part only rotting away. By 
this means I have assiu-ed myself that it is not proilungus ; at no 
stage of its growth, from the first leaves to the flowering stage, can 
it be mistaken for prcpdongus, on careful examination of its structure 
(leaves, stem, &c.). I hope to succeed in getting my specimens to 
fruit this year "' (p. 114).

Charles Darwin. By Grant Allen. ' English Worthies ' Series. 

Longmans. 

Mr. Grant Allen's book is a veritable triumphant march. 
Every page is bright with epithets, — " central Darwinian luminary," 
" magnificent all- sided conception," " stately fabric of vast 
theories," — as so many gaudy banners on which is inscribed the 
defeat and rout of the teleological school : of all, that is, who 
profess to see in nature the working of any intelligence higher than 
human. We are reminded of the complacent utterance of the 
panegyrist of Epicurus — 

Quare religio pedibus subjecta vicissim 
Obteritur, nos extequat victoria coelo. 

But a triumphant march is not a victory, although it may lead 
light-headed people to suppose that a victory has been gained. It 
is simply a " demonstration," in the modern political sense of a 
show and pageant, that proves nothing, but is got up to seem to 
mean much. 

But rhetoric aside, an arm of offence which teleologists can 
brandish as well as Darwinists, we ask what view of the universe 
it is that Mr. Grant Allen wishes us to accept on the strength 
of Darwin's discoveries. The sum is this, that matter is prior to 
mind, mind being the growth and outcome of matter : that there is 
no intelligence above man's, none at least that has anything to do 
with the world in which man moves : that a house is a thing 
planned and contrived, not so the architect — he is " the last product 
of kinetic solar energy," energy that needed neither creation to 
start it, nor providence to direct its course. And the proof ? It is 
the old story. First a hot, spinning nebula, or something of that 
kind. A certain degree of heat, no doubt : call that x. And a 
certain density, uniform or varying: call the average density y. 
And a certain angular velocity of rotation : call it z. These are 
definite quantities. Now we ask, why ;i-, y, z, rather than any 
other quantities, x', y', z"> That is due, we are told, to the previous 
unknown history of the nebula. That answer is mere shuffling.

The question always returns : why have the antecedent conditions 
been such as to give this present collocation, and not any other of 
the myriad possible collocations or arrangements of material ? A 
teleologist will say that the collocation which .c, y, z represent, was 
planned by Intelligence. Stet fro ratiune vulmitas. Can Mr. Grant 
Allen put his hand on any one of Charles Darwin's discoveries that 
shall disprove this teleological explanation ? Unless he can, the 
position that matter is prior to mind remains unproven. 

But the nebula spins on, cools down, condenses into liquid, 
solidifies, till the tiniest and lowliest of vegetable organisms blooms 
suddenly on the bosom of primeval mud. How is this ? we ask. 
Some happy variation. A pretty thread to hang a whole philo- 
sophy on, like an elephant from a horse-hau*. But there the 
organism is, and of course it reproduces others, and they adapt 
themselves to their environment, and some individuals are a little 
unlike their progenitors, and this unlikeness proves an advantage 
to them, and they transmit it to their posterity ; and those indi- 
viduals who have this advantage, being stronger, supplant such as 
have it not. So vegetation grows luxuriant and manifold. And 
the lowest plants are very like the lowest annnals, often quite un- 
distinguishable ; so that we may suppose both plants and animals 
to have come from one humble source, that primitive organism, 
child of happy variation. There is a good deal here debatable 
enough ; and much that undoubtedly is true. The principle 
of natural selection must ever hold its place by the side of the law 
of universal gravitation as one of the grand laws of Nature. This 
means that Darwin must stand with Newton, the naturalist with 
the astronomer. In his capacity of naturalist he is worthy of no 
less a place. Whether natural selection will account for the 
variation of species to the extent which he cautiously implies, and 
his disciples open-mouthed proclaim, is matter of much question. 
A happy variation, as a shade of colour, or a slight increase of 
neck, must be small to begin with, too small very often to be of 
any assistance to its possessor in the struggle for life. Two beings 
must unite, each with this happy variation, in order to transmit it 
at all certainly and pronouncedly. Then there is the tendency to 
atavism, or reversion to an earlier and less improved type. Like- 
wise, catastrophes and wholesale devourings, which involve im- 
proved and unimproved in a common ruin. So natural selection 
works through a long chapter of accidents, and gets on slowly. 
But has it not infinite time to work in ? No, it has not. Modern 
research tends to show that at a certain epoch, a long way back cer- 
tainly, but still a limited term of years, no life, or none but the 
very lowest, was possible upon this earth by reason of the tempe- 
rature. 

These are difficulties for naturalists. The teleological school 
take their stand at three other principal points. The first is the 
origin of all things : why this world with its collocations rather than 
any other possible collocations, unless by the selection of Intelli- 
gence. The second is the origin of life. These two points Darwin 
has left as he found them. The third is the origin of man, and on

this lie has written in his ' Descent of Man,' how •' from the latter 
(the Old World monkeys), at a remote period, man, the wonder and 
glory of the universe, proceeded." Now, wliat does the teleologist 
say to that ? I abstract here from all teaching of Holy Scripture, 
and argue by science and philosophy, as we should have had to 
speculate had the Scriptures never been given to us. The teleo- 
logist then says that, speaking of animals, it is a mistake to discuss 
their bodily structure alone. In all the higher animals certainly, 
there is some sort of a soul. The soul is more perfect, if not in 
its being at least in its operation, where the body is more perfect. 

There is a difference between a material soul and a spiritual 
soul in this, that the latter can and the former cannot apprehend 
an universal idea away from individualizing circumstances. None 
but bodies of the highest organization are capable of uniting with 
a spiritual sovil ; this, becaiise soul and body in the animal have 
one joint operation. An inferior organism cannot take a con- 
current part in high psychical operations. Suppose then that all 
that Darwin has written on the gradual evolution of the anthropoid 
ape were true. Evolution is a progress of ever better organised 
bodies. In time, when organization is sufficiently advanced, 
suppose the next generation to have infused into it a spiritual and 
immortal soul. I have nothing to say to the antecedent possibility 
of man having been evolved in this way ; but let us suppose it pos- 
sible, which is going to extreme Darwinian lengths. Even then, 
there is no account rendered of the soul of man, unless that be 
ascribed to the creative act of a divine Intelligence. There is no 
evolving an immortal spirit out of cosmic mist, not even through 
billions of transformations, because thought and matter are not in 
the same order. If Mr. Clrant Allen maintains that they are, we 
ask on what particular process of inductive reasoning gone through 
by Darwin he relies for his proof. It is not enough to show that 
human thought is conditioned on a certain bodily organization dis- 
posed and operating in a certain way ; every student knows that. 
Nor is it enough, as Darwin has done, to trace analogies between 
emotions in man and in brutes ; for it is not emotion but intellect 
that is characteristic of man. Most human attributes have their 
analogues in the lower creation. Indeed it was a favourite idea of 
the schoolmen, that creatures rose one above the other in a gradual 
ascending scale. Such a scale has been drawn by Darwin and 
Haeckel. But the ascent, so gradual to the eye, is broken here and 
there by vast gulfs of difference. The villages of the Lebanon are 
so close that you can drop a stone from one to the other, but there 
is a perpendicular precipice between. There is not much difference 
to the eye between the lowest man and one of Haeckel's anthropoid 
apes, nor between a living spore and a speck of dust. But there is 
a difference so vast that Darwin has been unable to sj)an it. He 
has not been able to explain the transition from brute matter to 
life, nor that from a material to a spiritual soul. The linger of 
God is here. 

One might expect that if ever lower animals had a chance 
of attaining, if not human form, at least human intelligence, it

would be in historic times, when they are especially bred and 
trained and cultivated by man's care. Yet they fall hopelessly 
short ; they get no nearer, except as man may get nearer the stars 
by going upstairs. Is this because Nature has fallen off in her 
variability, being no longer young ? Then natural selection is not 
enough for evolution, but we need a certain indwelling potentiality. 
Whence came this potentiality ? The teleologist will call it, with 
all respect to Mr. Grant Allen, " a creative nisus." 

Again, man is a free being. Or has Darwin shown that he is 
not ? But how can freewill have grown out of the necessary 
evolution of matter ? 

These are some of the doubts of a teleologist touching the 
Darwinian formularies. They form part of his scientific plea for 
still holding the old faith to be better than the new. The worship 
of God the Creator has survived the discovery that the stars are 
not animals, and that they are not borne about by angels. Our 
idea of God's majesty has even gained by dropping epicycles and 
geocentricism. Teleologists will yet "baptize" Darwin, as they 
baptized Aristotle in the thirteenth century, and classical literature 
in the sixteenth. They will accept as much evolution as is capable 
of proof, and glorify God Who planted the germ and primitive 
potentiality. They will yet, as Kingdon Clifford once dreaded they 
would, seize all the glories of modern science and weave them into 
a crown for the Creator and Eedeemer of men.

The most noteworthy feature of Mr. Kir by Trimmer's book 
(apart from its very high price) is his arrangement, with descrip- 
tions, of the Norfolk mints. Norfolk has been rendered the 
classical county for meuthologists by Smith and Sole, and Mr. 
Trimmer has evidently very carefully studied these interesting but 
puzzling plants, inasmuch as he speaks of his collection as con- 
taining about a hundred and fifty specimens of M, hirsuta alone. 
These he groups under six " forms," designated by the Greek 
letters, each being carefully described. He mentions a plant of 
M. alopecuruides which, "when gathered, measured 4 ft. 3^^ in. in 
height." The Mints occupy thirteen pages — more than one-sixth 
of the whole work ; and the care which ]\Ir. Trimmer has bestowed 
on them makes us regret that other genera have not received a 
share of his attention. An interesting note on a habitat of 
Spiranthi's autuiiinalis is worth quoting : — " In the autumn of 1869 
I met with this plant in St. Mary's Island, Scilly, growing abun- 
dantly in a very remarkable situation, namely, in the crevices and

on the top of the rampant-wall [rampart-wall ?] of the garrison at 
Heugh Town." 

Mr. Pigott's " little book does not profess to be a book of 
scientific botany, or even a complete list of all the plants to be 
found in the neighbourhood of Cromer." This is just as well, for 
it certainly has no claims to be so regarded. It is in the usual 
style of popular books about wild flowers — full of poetry (not 
always correctly cited) and moralisings and (mostly second-hand) 
quotations from old books, with a dash of Mr. Grant Allen, whose 
method of " accounting for" the colours of flowers and the forms 
of leaves seems to be accepted by Mr. Pigott with implicit con- 
fidence. Some of the Latin (or as the author styles them 
" generic ") names, which are relegated to the margin, are some- 
what iinfamiliar to our eyes — such as Saxifraya muralis (the 
English synonym of which, "the Nine-leaved Saxifrage," is also 
strange to us) and Ihcmex dioecious. 

Mr, Geldart's paper is an enumeration, without localities, of the 
plants of the county, so far as known up to the summer of 1883, 
prefaced by a short but interesting introduction. The Mosses, 
Hepatics, Lichens, and Algfe are included, the lists of these being 
due, wholly or in part, to Miss A. M. Barnard. Each of these is 
furnished with what it is customary to call an " English name," 
except the seaweeds, which for some reason escape. It would be 
interesting to know whether any one in real life ever spoke of the 
"blunt pear-shaped beardless moss" or the "scurfy imbricated 
parmelia " or the " papillary pycnothelia; " and it would be further 
of interest to know whether such names are considered by any 
sane person to be easier to speak and to remember than the 
scientific titles.

Walks in Kpping Forest. Edited by Percy Lindley. London : 
123-125, Fleet Street. Long 8vo, pp. 117. 6d. 

The value of Epping Forest as a hunting-ground for London 
naturalists, coupled with its recent preservation to the public and 
its careful exploration by the Essex Field Club, have all tended to 
make it one of the most popular of London resorts ; and to this 
popularity we owe the two handbooks named above. 

Mr. E.N. Buxton's is the more generally useful of the two, 
and has systematic lists of the Fauna and Flora — the former 
exquisitely illustrated, the latter more especially concerning us. 
This owes its value chiefly to Mr. G. S. Boulger, recently president 
of the Essex Field Club, and the Messrs. Ware, of Tottenham, so 
far as the phanerogams are concerned ; there are also lists of the 
fungi and mosses, mainly the work of Mr. James English. The 
sentence preceding the list of fungi is a little puzzling: — "The 
real plant proper, or Mycelium, dives underground, and may live 
for years in that condition Avithout producing its fungi, which are 
analogous to the flower or fruit of a plant." As Mr. Buxton is

Chairman of the London School Board, we may also suggest the 
desirability of his revising the spelling of the names of the fungi, 
many of which stand much in need of such attention : e. g., 
"saponaceous," "purpuracens," "aboviolescens," " cennabarinus," 
and the like. No fewer than twenty "routes" for exploring the 
Forest are laid down, and there are excellent maps. 

Mr. Percy Lindley's little book is less suited to the naturalist 
than Mr, Buxton's, to which Mr. Lindley acknowledges his in- 
debtedness, but will be found quite sufficient for most ramblers. 
The small portion devoted to plants is not the most satisfactory 
part of the book. There are many illustrations, and its cheapness 
is remarkable. 

Flowering Plants and Ferns of the Riviera and neighbouring Mountains. 
Drawn and described by C. Bicknell. London : Triibner, 
1885. 82 coloured plates with text. £8 3s. Od. 

This handsome book is the outcome of a recommendation by 
Mr. Moggridge in his ' Contributions to the Flora of Mentone,' that 
others should " follow his example and publish for the benefit and 
pleasure of the constantly-increasing winter residents in the 
Riviera " drawings of the plants of the district. Although hardly 
on a level scientifically with Mr. Moggridge 's book, Mr. Bicknell' s 
drawings evidence careful study and conscientious work, and 
the volume is thus distinctly in advance of most of its class. 
Two or three species are figured in each plate, and are accompanied 
with brief but sufficient botanical diagnoses. All have been 
collected by the author, who has made a collection of some eleven 
hundred drawings, and is " hoping to prepare a second series 
should this first one be found to meet a want." How this may be 
we cannot venture to prophesy. The book is an expensive one ; but 
there must be many who will gladly add it to their libraries. The 
colour-printing is fairly good, but might be better ; it is not up to 
the level, for example, of some of the plates given weekly in 
the 'Garden.'* The descriptions have always been "carefully 
verified from living specimens." The modest tone in which Mr. 
Bicknell writes, as well as the evidences of care taken both in 
drawing and description, induce us to wish well to this handsome 
volume.

OBITUARY. 

Benedict Eoezl died at Smicbor, Prague, on October 14tb last, 
from a long biliary fever, in bis 61st year. He was very well 
regarded in borticultural circles as an earnest collector of living 
plants, especially Orcbids, and as tbe uncle of tbe brothers Klabocb, 
one of wbom, Edward, is still collecting witb success, when the 
otber died a martyr of horticulture. Eoezl has discovered numerous 
plants, as the Dalechampia Roezlii, Bollea ccelestis, Masdevallia 
Chimaira, Roezlii, Livingstoniana, and many others. He travelled in 
the Southern United States, in Mexico, Ecuador, New Granada, 
and Venezuela. Nobody would have expected the early death of so 
strong a man, though it is well known tbe loss of a limb helps to 
shorten life ; and Eoezl had lost his left arm, which loss made him 
give up farming and collect plants. — H. G. Eeichenbach. 

Baron Franz Ungern Sternberg, tbe monographer of Salico- 
naiads, died at Turin on August 12tb, having sufi'ered a very long 
time, and at last continually for nine months, from malaria fever. 
He was a medical man, and had held a government position at 
Tenda, in the Alpes Maritimes, for some time, as long as he could 
stand it, as Tenda, such a sweet place for botanists, aftbrds indeed 
very little higher comfort to an educated man. Thus be was an 
authority for the environs of Tenda. He was an especial pupil of 
Bungc, who regarded him very highly. Many botanic tourists have 
enjoyed bis kind assistance when at Tenda, so that I am sure the 
news of his death will also be much regretted by several readers of 
this Journal. — H. G. Eeichenbach. 



Sir Joseph D. Hooker has resigned bis post as Director of the 
Eoyal Gardens, Kew.
