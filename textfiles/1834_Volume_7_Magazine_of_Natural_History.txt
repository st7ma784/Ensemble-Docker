PREFACE 



In the course of the publication of the present Volume, we have 
complied with the general request of our correspondents, and 
brought out the Magazine of Natural History monthly, at a re- 
duced price. This will enable us to give a more ready insertion to 
the articles of our contributors, and, we trust, will prompt them to 
continue and to increase their communications. 

In taking a general survey of the progress of Natural History 
during the past year, it is gratifying to observe the establishment 
of Natural History Societies, one after another, in many parts of 
the country. The British Association has given a grand stimulus 
to natural history pursuits ; and the personal intercourse, among 
naturalists, to which it has led, cannot fail to be highly favourable 
to science, and to good feeling among scientific men. By this 
means, also, the great object of science, viz., that of reducing it to 
practice, and rendering it available for the purposes of domestic 
and general improvement, is likely to be more immediately effected, 
than by the single influence of the press. The Natural History 
Societies of York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Worcester, Bristol, Bel- 
fast, and various other places, and the Entomological Society of 
London, are in a flourishing condition, and some of them have 
begun to publish volumes of their Transactions, Not only are new 
periodicals, devoted wholly or partly to natural history, being 
established in the metropolis, but also in the provinces. Among 
these deserve more especially to be mentioned, the Entomological 
Magazine of London, and the Analyst of Worcester. 

The Continent of Europe, and more especially France and Ger- 
many, may be considered as having been long in advance of Britain 
in natural history pursuits. In the United States of America 
Natural History Societies are on the increase, and, what redounds 
much to the honour of a new country, The American Journal of 
Science (Silliman's) has been some years established, and continues 
to be respectably supported. There are societies in India which

embrace natural history, in common with agriculture and garden- 
ing ; and a magazine has been commenced in Australia, in which 
natural history forms a prominent feature. 

So congenial are natural history pursuits to the human mind, 
and so much do they tend to the progress of civilisation, to in- 
creased domestic comfort, to peace between nations, and to human 
happiness, that to us it appears that it would be treason to nature 
to assert that this state of things will not be progressive, and will 
not go on increasing, till the condition of mankind every-where is 
improved to an extent of which we can at present form no idea. 

The more frequent appearance of this Magazine, as well as the 
considerable addition to the quantity of matter which will be given 
in the course of the year, demands corresponding exertions on the 
part of its Editor and Conductor ; but our readers and con- 
tributors may safely rely on these being made. In conclusion, 
we cordially thank our contributors for their past assistance, and 
earnestly invite them to continue to add to the common stock of 
knowledge through the medium of our pages.

Art. I. Facts suggesting to Man his fittest Mode of dejending him- 
self from Attacks of Animals of the Feline and Canine Tribes* 
By Charles Waterton, Esq. 

A MAN, at some period or other of his hfe, may have the 
misfortune to come in contact with the larger individuals 
of these two desperate and sanguinary races of quadrupeds. 
Perhaps a few hints, of a precautionary nature, in case of col- 
lision, may not be altogether unacceptable to Mr. Loudon's 
readers. 

The dog and the lion are both most formidable foes to an 
unarmed man ; and it is singular enough that the very resist- 
ance which he would be forced to make, in order to escape 
being worried by the former, would inevitably expose him to 
certain destruction from the claws and teeth of the latter. 

All animals of the dog tribe must be combated with might 
and main, and with unceasing exertion, in their attacks upon 
man : for, from the moment they obtain the mastery, they 
worry and tear their victim, as long as life remains in it. On 
the contrary, animals of the cat tribe having once overcome 
their prey, they cease, for a certain time, to inflict further 
injury on it. Thus, during the momentous interval from the 
stroke which has laid a man beneath a lion, to the time when 
the lion shall begin to devour him, the man may have it in his 
power to rise again, either by his own exertions, or by the 
fortuitous intervention of an armed friend. But then, all 
depends upon quiet, extreme quiet, on the part of the man, 
until he plunges his dagger into the heart of the animal: for, 
if he tries to resist, he is sure to feel the force of his adver-

sary's claws and teeth with redoubled vengeance. Many 
years ago, Colonel DufF, in India, was laid low by the stroke 
of a Bengal tiger. On coming to himself, he found the animal 
standing over him. Recollecting that he had his dirk by his 
side, he drew it out of the case, in the most cautious manner 
possible, and, by one happy thrust quite through the heart, 
he laid the tiger dead at his side. 

I will here mention a trivial row I once had with two dogs. 
It will tend to prove the advantage of standing up manfully, 
when attacked by animals of the canine tribe ; and I will con- 
clude with recounting an adventure with a lion, perhaps un- 
paralleled in the annals of hunting. 

Towards the close of the year 1823, in passing over a com- 
mon, I accidentally came upon two dogs. One of them was a 
stout, ill-looking, uncouth brute, apparently of that genealogy 
which dog-fanciers term half bull and half terrier; the other 
was an insignificant female cur. The dog immediately bristled 
up ; and I had just time to take off my hat, and hold it shield- 
wise, in self-defence, when he came on, and made directly at 
it. I gave him a hearty kick under the breast, which caused 
him to desist for a moment. But he stoutly renewed the 
attack, which was continued for above five minutes ; he always 
flying at the hat, and I regularly repeating my kicks, some- 
times slightly, sometimes heavily, according to our relative 
situations. In the mean time the female cur was assailing me 
from behind ; and it was with difficulty that I succeeded in 
keeping her clear of me, by means of swinging my foot back- 
wards at her. At last, a lucky blow on her muzzle, from the 
heel of my shoe, caused her to run away howling, and the dog 
immediately followed her, just at the moment when two ma- 
sons were coming up to assist me. Thus, by a resolute oppo- 
sition, I escaped laceration. But this little affair is scarcely 
worth relating, except that it affords a proof of the advantage 
to be derived from resisting the attack of a dog to the utmost. 
And now for the feline tribe. The story which I am about 
to recount will show that nonresistance was the only plan to 
be pursued, when escape from death seemed utterly hopeless. 
The principals in this affair were a brave young British officer 
and a full-grown lion of India. I was at Frankfort on the 
Mayne in August last, and I heard the account from the 
officer^s own mouth. I shall never forget the affable and un- 
assuming manner in which he related it to me. I repeatedly 
urged him to allow me to put it on record, and, at the same 
time, to make use of his name; but I plainly saw that his 
feelings were against his complying with my request, and I 
think I should not have succeeded, had I not luckily brought 



Feline and Canine Animals. 3 

to my assistance the plea of benefit to natural history. With 
this I conquered the objections of the young soldier ; and I 
only wish that it had fallen to an abler pen than mine to relate 
the following adventure. 

In the month of July, 1831, two fine lions made their 
appearance in a jungle, some twenty miles distant from the 
cantonment of Rajcote, in the East Indies, where Capt. Wood- 
house, and his two friends, Lieutenants Delamain and Lang, 
were stationed. An elephant was despatched to the place in 
the evening on which the information arrived ; and on the 
morrow, at the break of day, the three gentlemen set off on 
horseback, full of glee, and elated with the hope of a speedy 
engagement. On arriving at the edge of the jungle, people 
were ordered to ascend the neighbouring trees, that they 
might be able to trace the route of the lions, in case they left 
the cover. After beating about in the jungle for some time, 
the hunters started the two lordly strangers. The officers 
fired immediately, and one of the lions fell, to rise no more. 
His companion broke cover, and took off across the country. 
The officers now pursued him on horseback, as fast as the 
nature of the ground would allow, until they learned from the 
men who were stationed in the trees, and who held up flags by 
way of signal, that the lion had gone back into the thicket. 
Upon this, the three officers returned to the edge of the jungle, 
and, having dismounted from their horses, they got upon the 
elephant; Captain Woodhouse placing himself in the hinder- 
most seat. They now proceeded towards the heart of the 
jungle, in the expectation of rousing the royal fugitive a second 
time. They found him standing under a large bush, with his 
face directly towards them. The lion allowed them to approach 
within range of his spring, and then he made a sudden dart 
at the elephant, clung on his trunk with a tremendous roar, 
and wounded him just above the eye. While he was in the 
act of doing this, the two lieutenants fired at him, but without 
success. The elephant now shook him off; but the fierce and 
sudden attack on the part of the lion seemed to have thrown 
him into the greatest consternation. This was the first time 
he had ever come in contact with so formidable an animal; 
and much exertion was used before his riders succeeded in 
urging him on again in quest of the lion. At last, he became 
somewhat more tractable ; but, as he was advancing through 
the jungle, all of a sudden, the lion, which had lain concealed 
in the high grass, made at him with redoubled fury. The 
officers now lost all hopes of keeping their elephant in order. 
He turned round abruptly, and was going away quite un- 
governable, when the lion again sprang at him, seized liis 



4 Man^s fittest Mode of Defence against 

hinder parts with his teeth, and hung on them, until the 
affrighted animal managed to shake him oJfF by incessant 
kicking. 

The lion retreated farther into the thicket; Captain Wood- 
house, in the mean time, firing a random shot at him, which 
proved of no avail ; as the jolting of the elephant, and the 
uproar of the moment, prevented him from taking a steady 
aim. No exertions on the part of the officers could now force 
the terrified elephant to face his fierce foe, and they found 
themselves reduced to the necessity of dismounting. Deter- 
mined, however, to come to still closer quarters with the formid- 
able king of quadrupeds, Capt. Woodhouse took the desperate 
resolution to proceed on foot in quest of him ; and, after 
searching about for some time, he saw the lion indistinctly 
through the bushes, and discharged his rifle at him; but he 
was pretty well convinced that he had not hit him ; for he saw 
the lion retire, with the utmost composure, into the thicker 
parts of the brake. The two lieutenants, M'ho had remained 
at the outside of the jungle, joined their companion, on hear- 
ing the report of his gun. 

The weather was intolerably sultry. After vainly spending 
a considerable time in creeping through the grass and bushes, 
with the hope of discovering the place of the lion's retreat, 
they concluded that he had passed quite through the jungle, 
and gone off in an opposite direction. Resolved not to let 
their game escape, the lieutenants returned to the elephant, 
find immediately proceeded round the jungle, expecting to 
discover the route which they conjectured the lion had taken. 
Captain Woodhouse, however, rem.ained in the thicket, and, 
as he could discern the print of the animal's feet on the 
ground, he boldly resolved to follow up the track, at all 
hazards. The Indian gamefinder, who continued with his 
commander, at last espied the lion in the cover, and pointed 
him out to the captain, who fired, but unfortunately missed 
his mark. There was now no alternative left but to retreat and 
load his rifle. Having retired to a distance, he was joined by 
Lieutenant Delamain, who had dismounted from his elephant 
on hearing the report of the gun. This unexpected meeting 
increased the captain's hopes of ultimate success. He lost no 
time in pointing out to the lieutenant the place where he 
would probably find the lion, and said he would be up with 
him in a moment or two. 

Lieutenant Delamain, on going eight or ten paces down a 
sheep-track, got a sight of the lion, and instantly discharge^ 
his rifle at him. 



Feline and Canine Animals. 5 

" Impetus est fulvis, et vasta leonibus ira ! " 

" Vast is their fury and as vast their power." — Eusden's Trans. 

This irritated the mighty lord of the woods, and he rushed 
towards him, breaking through the bushes (to use the cap- 
tain's own words) " in most magnificent style.'* Captain 
Woodhouse now found himself placed in an awkward situ- 
ation. He was aware that if he retraced his steps, in order to 
put himself in a better position for attack, he would just get 
to the point from which the lieutenant had fired, and to which 
the lion was making : wherefore, he instantly resolved to stand 
still, in the hopes that the lion would pass by, at a distance of 
four yards or so, without perceiving him, as the intervening 
cover was thick and strong. In this, however, he was most 
unfortunately deceived; for the enraged lion saw him in 
passing, and flew at him with a dreadful roar. In an instant, 
as though it had been done by a stroke of lightning, the rifle 
was broken and thrown out of the captain's hand, his left arm, 
at the same moment, being seized by the claws, and his right 
by the teeth, of his desperate antagonist. While these two 
brave and sturdy combatants, " whose courage none could 
stain," were yet standing in mortal conflict. Lieutenant Dela- 
main ran up, and discharged his piece full at the lion. This 
caused the lion and the captain to come to the ground toge- 
ther, while Lieutenant Delamain hastened out of the jungle to 
reload his gun. The lion now began to craunch the captain's 
arm ; but as the brave fellow, notwithstanding the pain which 
this horrid process caused, had the cool determined resolution 
to lie still, the lordly savage let the arm drop out of his 
mouth, and quietly placed himself in a couching position, 
with both his paws upon the thigh of his fallen foe. While 
things were in this untoward situation, the captain, unthink- 
ingly, raised his hand to support his head, which had got 
placed ill at ease in the fall. No sooner, however, had he 
moved it, than the lion seized the lacerated arm a second 
time ; craunched it, as before, and fractured the bone still 
higher up. This additional memento mori from the lion was 
not lost upon Captain Woodhouse ; it immediately put him in 
mind that he had committed an act of imprudence in stirring. 
The motionless state in which he persevered after this broad 
hint showed that he had learned to profit by the painful 
lesson. 

He now lay, bleeding and disabled, under the foot of a 
mighty and an irritated enemy. Death was close upon him, 
armed with every terror calculated to appal the heart of a 

B 3

prostrate and defenceless man. Just as this world, with all 
its flitting honours, w^as on the point of vanishing for ever, he 
heard two faint reports of a gun, which he thought sounded 
from a distance ; but he was totally at a loss to account for 
them. He learned, after the affair was over, that the reports 
were caused by his friend at the outside of the jungle, who 
had flashed off some powder, in order to be quite sure that 
the nipples of his rifle were clean. 

The two lieutenants were now hastening to his assistance, 
and he heard the welcome sound of feet approaching; but, 
unfortunately, they were in a wrong direction ; as the lion was 
betwixt them and him. Aware that, if his friends fired, the 
balls would hit him, after they had passed through the lion's 
body, Captain Woodhouse quietly pronounced, in a low and 
subdued tone, " to the other side ! to the other side ! " 
Hearing the voice, they looked in the direction from whence 
it proceeded, and to their horror saw their brave comrade in 
his utmost need. Having made a circuit, they cautiously 
came up on the other side, and Lieutenant Delamain, whose 
coolness in encounters with wild beasts had always been con- 
spicuous, from a distance of about a dozen yards, fired at the 
lion over the person of the prostrate warrior. 

The lion merely quivered ; his head dropped upon the 
ground, and in an instant he lay dead on his side, close to his 
intended victim. The lieutenant's aim was so good and true, 
that it puts one in mind of what happened at Chevy Chace ; 

" Against Sir Hugh Montgomery 
So right the shaft was set, 
The grey goose wing that was thereon 
In his heart's blood was wet ! " 

Thus ended this ever-memorable homo-leonine encounter. 
I beg to return my thanks to Captain Woodhouse for allow- 
ing me to avail myself of it. From what has been related, a

we have the misfortune to be struck to the ground by an ani-

I bade a long farewell to Captain Woodhouse, and his two

them !

Green-ljoinged Teals of America and Britai?i. 7 

Art. II. On the Green-tvinged Teals of America and Britain. 
By James Drummond Marshall, M.D. 

During the mania for forming new genera and species which 
seems at present to exist, when names and distinctions hitherto 
employed are no longer permitted to occupy the place they 
formerly held in our nomenclatures, it is strange that even 
one species should have been allowed to remain in obscurity 
under a different name ; more particularly a species pre- 
senting so many distinguishing traits as the green-winged teal 
of America, the subject of the present remarks. 

The similarity between this bird and the common teal of 
Britain has appeared so great, as to lead Wilson, and other 
writers on the subject, to consider them as one and the same 
species. Wilson says, " On an examination of the figure 
and description of the European teal by the ingenious and 
accurate Bewick, and comparing them with the present (the 
green-winged teal), no difference v/hatever appears in the 
length, extent, colour, or markings of either, but what com- 
monly occurs among individuals of any other tribe ; both, 
undoubtedly, belong to one and the same species." 

Now, it is remarkable that Wilson, who has been in general 
so accurate an observer of nature, and whose descriptions are 
so correctly and beautifully given, should in this case have 
overlooked the disparity between these two birds ; a disparity 
sufficiently great, in my opinion, to constitute them distinct 
species. On looking at the birds separately, and not having 
previously compared them, one would be inclined to pronounce 
them of the same species ; but when a specimen of each is 
laid before you, the markings will be perceived to be in many 
points totally different. Latham, Forster, Pennant, Bonaparte, 
and the authors of the Northern Zoology^ have mentioned some 
of the distinguishing marks, but have merely considered the 
American as a variety of the European, and not a species 
distinct from it. Sir William Jardine, in his beautiful edition 
of the American Ornithology, is of opinion that the species are 
distinct, and has accordingly given the American teal the 
distinguishing name of ^oschas carolinensis. It shall be my 
aim, in the present remarks, to show that the American and 
European teals are in many points totally different ; and that 
Sir William Jardine has, with great propriety, made them, 
for the first time, distinct species. 

In length, extent, weight, and general appearance, they 
nearly correspond. The crest in the American species is 
perhaps larger than in the European, and the black extends 
farther down the throat. The bill is smaller and niore

slender in the American, and the edges of the upper man- 
dible considerably overlap those of the lower mandible. In 
the American, the white streak is wanting which extends 
from the bill over the eye in the European ; and the white 
line below the eye is also nearly wanting, being but very in- 
distinctly marked in the American. The beautiful cream- 
coloured longitudinal band on the scapulars, which is so 
evident in the European, is totally wanting in the other; 
while across the shoulder, a very distinct transverse bar of 
white (about IJin. long, and three eighths of an inch broad) 
is noticed, no trace of which is seen in the European. 

Now, to me, these marks afford sufficient evidence of the 
birds not belonging to the same species. When we speak 
of a variety of a bird, we mean a certain departure from the 
ordinary structure or plumage of that species ; but where so 
many writers, for so long a period, have noticed a decided 
difference among the members of what was supposed the same 
species, we cannot surely longer continue the inappropriate 
term of variety. 

For the better illustration of the subject, I shall accompany 
these remarks by figures of both the species ; and any one 
who compares them must, I think, be struck with the differ- 
ence. {Jigs. 1. and 2.) It is strange that Wilson should 
have given a figure of the American bird, without the white 
line extending over the eye, and with the transverse bar on 
the shoulder, two of the most distinguishing marks, and yet 
have called it merely a variety of the European ; while in 
Rennie's edition of Montagu's Ornithological DictionaTy we 
find an engraving intended to represent the British species, 
but which is evidently copied from Wilson's plate, and marked 



of America and Britain, 



Green.winged Teal of North America, 

with the bar of white in the shoulder, which is never seen in the 
British teal ; thus perpetuating an error, or at least giving a 
representation of the American bird accompanying the de- 
scription of the British species. An accurate engraving of 
the latter may be found in Bewick, similar to the one here 
supplied. 

In the Proceedings of the Committee of Science and Cor" 
respondence of the Zoological Society of London, Colonel 
Sykes mentions the A^nos Crecca, or common teal, as being 
found in the Dukhun, and that his specimens appeared 
identical with male and female British specimens. He has 
also in his possession specimens resembling the Jtmxs Crecca, 
but in which the proportional length of the intestinal canal 
differs so much from that of the yi^nas Crecca (3*30 to 1, and 
5'57 to l), that he is induced to believe that they may belong 
to a distinct species. Now, it would be well worthy of attention, 
to have the relative length of the intestinal canal of the 
American species (^oschas carolinensis Jar dine) compared 
with that stated by Colonel Sykes, lest the teal found in 
Dukhun may be the same as the American, and not the 
European, as now supposed. 

I do not mean to say that the length of the intestinal canal 
should be a sufficient datum to constitute a new species, but 
the difference in plumage may have been overlooked, as has 
been hitherto done, and the species thus confounded. It 
seems to me much more probable that the American and 
Indian species should be the same, than that the American 
should differ from both the Indian and European, and these 
latter be similar. 

I merely throw out these hints to induce further investi- 
gation ; and, should they lead some one to pursue the subject 
farther, they will not have been made in vain.

Sir, 
I MISTOOK the spider of which 1 send you a sketch for 
Pholcus 2^halangioi(les, which I had never met with living. 
The great length of its legs, the cylindric body {fg. 3. q)^ and 
the attitude, caused it to bear so considerable a resem- 
blance to that species, that it was only on carefully examin- 
ing the eyes and parts of manducation, that I discovered 
my error. As it agrees exactly with none of the heretofore 
established genera, I propose naming it 

Tri'chopus. {Thrixy hair, poz^5, foot; legs extremely hairy, the hairs 
themselves branched, n.) Eyes 8, large, subequal, separated by a con- 
siderable interval from the base of thq mandibles ; placed in two rows, tiie 
anterior curving considerably downwards and having the eyes approximated, 
the posterior curving forwards and having the eyes widely separated, the 
exterior being placed on a species of tubercle {fig. 3. a b). Mandibles 
cylindric, cut off very obliquely beyond the middle of their inner side, and 
presenting a cavity toothed on both sides for receiving the strong curved 
hook ; hairy and spiny (c). MaxUI<e strong, rounded externally at the 
apex, and cut off very abruptly internally, contracted behind the middle, 
and dilated slightly where they receive the palpi (d). Li]} higher than 
broad, narrowed anteriorly, and with a sinus at the tip which in rest re- 
ceives the apex of the anterior lip (</). Palpus long, curved downwards; 
1st and 2d joints short, 3d very long, 5th long, and 6th in the male elon- 
gate pyriforra without a hook ; spiny and hairy (rf''). Cephalothorax cir- 
cular or broadly oval behind, produced anteriorly. Legs very long and 
very hairy, with a few spines especially on the tibia; 1st pair {h i), 9 times 
the length of the thorax ; 2d and 4th pair, 7| times ; 3d pair, 6^ times : 
tarsus clawed. Abdomen cylindric with 2 long feelers, and short spinnerets. 

Tr. libratus. {LibratuSy balanced; pensile appearance of insect when 
at rest, jo.) Cephalothorax brownish green posteriorly, castaneous an- 
teriorly, with 2 irregular parallel black lines running from the posterior 
intermediate eyes down the back, terminating half way by joining semi- 
lunar patches which occupy the remainder, and which have 3 irregular pro- 
cesses projecting outwards towards the origins of the legs ; internally they 
are shaded off, but rather defined behind the middle thoracic point, which is 
marked by a minute short line; beneath reddish brown, darker towards the 
edges, but with a brighter spot opposite the origin of each leg. — Abdomen

3 triangles surmounting each other, the apices deficient ; behind these 
the central line has a series (four) of small crescents arching backwards. 
From the external angles of the festooned lines dark patches run out- 
wards and backwards. Beneath concolorous ; 4 parallel festooned lines

I have never seen more than two males, and, of course, am 
unacquainted with the female. It bears the closest resem- 
blance in its generic characters to ^ranea and Agelena ; 
but differs in the eyes being nearly equal, in the length of 
the lip, and in the maxillae dilated at the apex : the palpi, 
too, diiFer considerably. From Clubiona, to which the ap-

pearance of the maxillae would carry us, it is easily separable 
by the size of the eyes, the greater curvature of the rows, 
the lip, mandibles, and palpi, and, above all, the great length 
of the legs. It weaves, in the corners of unfrequented build- 
ings, a coarse irregular net with a recess, in which it awaits 
its unlucky prey. When at rest, it is usually supported by 
the legs, as represented by the outline p ; and then the tibiae, 
standing perpendicularly, present the appearance of a series 
of columns. 

In examining the insect minutely with a magnifying power 
of about 30, I was struck with the appearance presented by 
the hairs about the claws : these (the tip of one is seen at I) 
were very stiff, spine-like, and serrated along the edges, 
especially at the apical extremity (z), and nearly all arose from 
the under surface of the tarsus, enveloping the claws (seey). 
A single claw is figured at g, to show its form, and the pec- 
tinated teeth, thirteen or fourteen in number. I found that, 
along the whole legs, the hairs had more or less of this 
appearance (/); the serrae, however, diminishing in sharpness as 
I approached the. body ; and among these, and lying close to 
the limb, were other finer downy hairs, from the sides of 
which proceeded alternate secondary hairs ; a representation 
of one of these is given (w). The leg itself is shown at h and 
i, the latter being the tarsus. The discovery of these ano- 
malies (anomalies from anything I had before observed) in- 
duced me to examine other portions of the body ; and I 
found that some of the hairs, or rather spines, jutting out 
from the mandibles, had hairs differing from the former : from 
these innumerable little processes proceeded in a spiral direc- 
tion, as seen at k, being most strongly marked towards the 
tip of the spine. On the palpi the spines were merely ser- 
rated (see o), and only on the last three joints. I could not 
find any elsewhere. On the exterior portions of the maxillae, 
both kinds of hairs or spines were detected ; but along the 
inner edge, the tufts were found to have hairs quite flat and 
smooth until within a little of the apex, where they became 
plumed mostly on one side alone. The longer curved ones 
at the extremity of the maxilla were exactly similar : they 
are represented at e, and a few detached have this portion 
represented at m, A singular appearance also presented itself 
in a row of sixty-eight minute blunt teeth extending the whole 
length of the curved extremity of the maxilla: two of these, 
highly magnified, are shown at e\ I now recollected having 
once before observed teeth similarly situated, but I have for- 
gotten in what species; but it would seem likely, if detected 
in a few, to offer characters which might be appropriated for

generic distinctions ; at any rate, directing attention to these 
points may, perhaps, lead to some curious particulars in allied 
genera. I am, Sir, yours, &c.

ston M. D., Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edin-

It is known to naturalists in general that Peyssonel, a phy- 
sician of Marseilles, who had travelled into Barbary and the 
Levant, was the first who distinctly published the animal 
nature of coral and of other lithophytes ; an opinion which, 
however true, gained no proselytes, until Abraham Trembley, 
a native of Geneva, had discovered the i^ydra and its wonder- 
ful properties ; and Bernard de Jussieu and Ellis had demon- 
strated the existence of similar polypes in a great number of 
the lithophytes and zoophytes of the European shores. Since 
that time it has been believed that the little tenants of every 
zoophytical production, and all the little creatures which are 
found embedded in any common gelatinous mass, are po- 
lypes identical in structure, or nearly so, with the Hydra ; 
and, in this belief, many fleshy and fibrous productions which 
were known or imagined to be a common matrix of a numerous 
colony, were unhesitatingly arranged together in the same 
class, under the denomination of ^Icyonium. The structure 
of a few of these was ascertained, and seemed to confirm the 
propriety of this classification ; for there could be no doubt 
that the inhabitants of the ^Icyonium digitatum of Linnaeus 
were truly polypes ; and this was the best known and most 
easily examined species. Nor were the observations of

Schlosser, or of Gaertner, whose name is immortalised by his 
work on seeds, sufficiently precise or distinctly announced to 
invalidate the received notions ; so that we may safely assert 
that, previously to the year 1815, no naturalist had even sus- 
pected that the individuals of the compound y^lcyonia pos- 
sessed any more complicated organisation than zoophytes in 
general. 

At the commencement of the year just mentioned, Savigny 
read to the French Institute a memoir which at once over- 
turned the establibhed opinion, and which, while it forms, 
from the newness and importance of its matter, an epoch in 
the history of invertebrate animals, was also of great utility in 
directing the attention of naturalists to a department which 
had lain long uncultivated. By a series of the most delicate 
dissections, exhibited in engravings of equal delicacy and 
beauty, Savigny proved that very many of the compound 
^Icyonia possessed inmates whose structure was such as to 
give them a claim to be enrolled in the class Mollusca : and 
the claim, although still disputed by many, has been allowed 
by the most illustrious naturalist of modern, perhaps of any, 
times. Savignyj at all events, showed that these minute 
creatures were organised very differently from the gelatinous 
polype or hydra ; and that, instead of a simple stomach for its 
only viscus, they had both thoracic and abdominal viscera, 
two separate apertures for these viscera, special organs of 
generation, and, in some, he thought, vessels and traces of a 
circulating system were by no means equivocal. 

Of the productions which were the subject of Savigny's 
dissections and enquiries, there are several species in the 
British seas, which the reader will find enumerated in Dr. 
Fleming's history of our native animals; and I believe that 
the two to be figured for the present series of Illustrations are 
additions to his list. They had, when recent, so much resem- 
blance to a fig, that it was not doubted that one of them, at 
least, would prove to be identical with the y^lcyonium f icus 
of Ellis; but a closer examination showed the contrary. 
The naturalist, however, will not find, in our rude dissections 
and figures, the various organs exhibited with the clearness 
and definiteness they have in the engravings of Savigny : 
what the artist saw was correctly drawn, and, if they are found 
sufficient for specific discrimination, my object is accom- 
plished. It may merely be remarked, that, in one, 1 could 
perceive, in the large thoracic cavity, traces of a netlike 
structure on the w^alls, similar to some of those figured by 
Savigny, and sufficient to convince me of his general accuracy ; 
but they are not shown in our figure, as the appearances were

Description, Common body adherent by a broad base, 
knob-like or pear-shaped, nearly an inch high and half that 
in diameter, smooth, gelatinous, pellucid, of a straw-yellow 
colour tinted with brown, and marked with whitish streaks 
from the immersed animals. There are no fibres nor spicula 
to strengthen this common mass ; neither are there any visible 
orifices on the surface ; but, by ripping up the skin with a 
needle, the contained animals may be removed entire without 
difficulty. These are of a long threadlike shape, with a 
bulging and nutant head, scattered irregularly in the sub- 
stance of the jelly, in which they lie horizontally or nearly so. 
The length of a single individual is about four tenths of an 
inch. The mouth [a) is cut into six equal segments, and 
placed on the upper side of the large branchial sac {b\ which

is an oval bag filled, in the specimens examined, with innu- 
merable minute granules. When the animalcule was com- 
pressed between plates of glass, these granules escaped 
abundantly from the mouth, and from a prominent aperture 
a little below it on the side. The walls of the branchial sac 
are marked with several lines or plaits in a longitudinal 
direction ; but I saw no traces of any vascular network. On 
the inner side of the branchial sac there is an obscure ap- 
pearance of an intestine or vessel winding up it to end at the 
anal aperture (c) ; and near the base of the sac there is a con- 
siderable orange-coloured spot marked with longitudinal lines, 
and presumed to be the stomach {d). Immediately below 
this, the body is suddenly contracted into a very long and 
linear tail, as it may be called, in which, when compressed, 
we perceive a dark intestine-like mark, mottled with darker 
and lighter shades on each side, and a clear space between 
them ; but I cannot trace any distinct termination of these 
organs (which are the ovaries) in the branchial sac, although 
the shadings at the base of this part indicate the existence and 
situation of some distinct organs. This species has a great 
resemblance to Aplidium effusum of Savigny, but I cannot 
consider them identical. Uab, Berwick Bay, in deep water.

Art. V. Remarks on the Natural Productions of Lexden and 
its Neighbourhood, By J. G. 

Our village stands on a gentle slope, at the foot of which 
runs the river Colne, winding its course through a picturesque 
valley, fertilising many rich and verdant mecidows, and turning 
in its passage a considerable number of mills. Our soil is 
generally a light gravel, and so very dry, that our usual paths 
are passable even in the depth of winter, and we are thereby 
afforded facilities for the enjoyment of sylvan scenery which 
but few neighbourhoods possess. 

Just below the village, on the north-west side, is a con- 
siderable extent of spongy boggy soil, full of springs of un- 
common purity and strength, which, in the short space of a 
quarter of a mile, form a crystal stream sufficient to drive a 
corn mill, lately erected on the spot. This stream, which 
affords a supply of 400 gallons a minute, is not at all affected 
by the seasons, being equally strong in the driest and the most 
rainy weather. 

Our parish is particularly well wooded, producing many 
lofty oaks, elms, and alders; and, consequently, we have most

* 

of the birds common to wooded districts, and some wliich are 
by no means generally diffused. 

The boggy ground, in which the springs have their rise, is 
covered with low alders, and produces much that is interesting 
to the botanist. The raspberry (.Rubus idae^us) abounds in 
it, and, when the fruit is ripe, presents a temptation to venture 
on the soft and treacherous soil. In spring, the brilliant 
Chrysospienium oppositifcMium, with its yellow flowers and 
shining foliage, forms large beds of green and gold ; the lowly 
wood sorrel (O'xalis Acetosella) hangs its pale and modest 
head beneath the mossy stumps of the decayed alders; the 
beautiful ferns, Aspidium i^ilix foe'mina and Aspidium di- 
latatum, luxuriate in the moisture and shade so congenial to 
them ; and the huge Carex paniculata rises to the height of 
four feet or more, and, with its long and elegant leaves issuing 
from the top of the stem, and reaching to the ground, might, 
by its exotic appearance, almost make you imagine that you 
had been suddenly transported into some tropical region, — 

" Where the huge palms extend their shady tops. 
And torrents foam o'er beds of golden sand." 

But the song of the nightingale in the adjoining copse, the 
peculiarly joyous and happy note of the willow wren (Cur- 
ri\ca Jrochilus), the loud and familiar laugh of the wood- 
pecker (Picus viridis), and the often repeated note of the 
marsh tit (Parus palustris) are sounds which will soon awaken 
feelings inseparably connected with " our own, our native 
isle," Amongst the vernal plants of our district must not be 
omitted the sweet Adoxa Moschatellina, which rears its 
delicate flowers on the moss-grown bank of many a shady 
hedgerow; a mild and certain harbinger of sunny days to 
come. On the dry banks we have Jasione montana and the 
diminutive yet elegant Ornithopus perpusillus. Our woods 
abound with the anemone and the hyacinth (Anemone ne- 
morosa and jScilla nutans), and our river banks are clothed 
with the beautiful spikes of Zvythrum Salicaria, the unassuming 
Scutellaria galericulata, and Cardamine amara w^ith its bright 
purple anthers. 

From the beginning of autumn to the end of the year, we 
see on the borders of our streams that graceful little bird 
the grey wagtail (Mbtacilla Boarula) taking its insect prey 
among the stones in the shallow water; and, in the depth of 
winter, the siskin (Pringilla iSpinus) abounds on the lofty 
alders, the seeds of which afford it acceptable food. The 
brilliant kingfisher (v4lcedo I'spida) is almost constantly to be 
seen skimming over the surface of our waters, or seated on

plumage is strongly contrasted with the sober dress of the 
skulking moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) which is flirting up 
its tail amongst the sedges hard by. We now and then see 
the kestrel (Falco 2mnunculus), the sparrowhawk (J5ilteo 
iVisus), and the hobby* (Falco Subbuteo); and our ears are 
often assailed, in the stillness of the night, by the clear and 
plaintive hooting of the brown owl (iStrix stridula), and the 
hoarse scream of its congener, the white owl (5'trix flammea). 
The nuthatch (5'itta europse^a) utters its shrill and frequent 
cry, " wit, wit, wit," in our groves ; while the notes of the jay, 
the cuckoo, the turtle dove, and the mingled melody of a 
host of summer visiters, " aid the full concert," and form 
together a chorus which, combined with the usual scenery 
around, must move to ecstasy every heart that is capable of 
any degree of sensibility, and which ought to engage the 
breast in the adoration of Him who has given us all these 
things richly to enjoy. 

Our streams afford a considerable variety of fish, but to 
these I have paid little attention; for, even in this sequestered 
spot, " far from the noise, the hum, the shock of men," the 
cares of life will intrude, to the exclusion of those pursuits of 
nature which console in adversity, and render prosperity 
doubly delightful. 

I have sometimes been much gratified in observing that 
elegant little animal, the water shrew (5orex fodiens), diving 
and sporting under a little waterfall in one of our groves : it 
is one of the prettiest of our few quadrupeds, and is an animal 
which appears to have attracted but little notice. 

We have all that can be desired in a country village, and 
whether our lovely scenes be visited in the glorious spring, 
when morning puts forth its melody from grove and park and 
verdant field, or in the silent and mellow autumn, when the 
cool air breathes vigour and health to the frame, and the 
brilliant dews bespangle the mossy turf, now strewed with 
many a yellow leaf, they cannot fail to delight and exalt the 
soul of every rational lover of the beauties of nature.

20 Altitude of Habitats of Plants in Cumberland, 



Art. VI. On the Altitude of the Habitats of Pla?its in Cumber- 
Inndf tvith Localities of the rarer Mountain Species, By Mr. 
Hewett Watson. 

Oft^sN as the county of Cumberland has been traversed 
by botanists, we are, nevertheless, yet very imperfectly ac- 
quainted with the stations of its rarer plants ; and there is, 
perhaps, not another county, of England in regard to the 
botanical productions of which there are so many errors in 
print. Under these circumstances, I need scarcely apologise 
for submitting some observations and discoveries, made during 
a month's residence at Keswick, in May and June of 1833. 
This county is so constantly visited by the students in every 
department of natural history, that there will doubtless be 
some, among the readers of this Magazine, to whom the fol- 
lowing notices will be useful. My attention was principally 
directed towards the influence of height in changing the vege- 
table productions ; and, taking the highest stations at which 
particular species were observed, they may be arranged in 
steps of 500 ft., as follows ; but Scawfell Pikes, the highest 
hill of the county, being only 3166 ft., the first step in our 
descent will be a shorter one. The names accord with those 
of Hooker's British Flora. 

1. Between 3000 ft. and 3160 ft. — O'xalis Acetosella, Ceras- 
tium viscosum, .Saxifraga stellaris, Galium saxatile. Campanula 
rotundifolia, FacciniumMyrtillus and Fitis idae\i, T'hymus^'er-

Carex rigida, JFestiica ovina, Lycopodium *Selago, Crypto- 
gramma crispa. 

2. Between 2500 ft. and 3000 ft. — Ranunculus acris, Caltha 
paldstris, Cardamine pratensis, Fiola canina, V. palustris, 
Pyrus aucuparia (the highest arborescent species, and the 
specimens of it only stunted bushes), Tormentilla officinalis, 
Geum rivale, Alchemilla alpina, Rhodiola josea, Chrysosple-

5. Between 1000 ft. and 1500 ft. — We begin to seethe 
oak, ash, holly, and other trees, with a large addition of 
smaller species; but it does not appear to be worth while for 
us to carry these lists below 1500 ft., since they would become 
more long than interesting as we descend to the low grounds. 

All these species descend to the low grounds about the 
lakes, except the following, the inferior limit of which appears 
to be at or about the heights added to their names : — jSaxi- 
fraga stellaris, 500 ft. ; *Salix herbacea, 2400 ft. ; iS'mpetrum 
nigrum, Carex rigida, 2200 ft. ; Alchemilla alpina, 400 ft. to 
600 ft.; Rhodiola rosea, 700 ft.; katice Armeria, about lOOOft. 
or 1200 ft.; 2'halictrum alpinum, probably 1200 ft.; Coch- 
learia danica; Epilobium clsinifolium, 700 ft. ; Oxyria reni- 
formis, 450 ft. Silene acaulis and »Saxifraga oppositit'51ia were 
only seen in one station, and are fixed at about 2000 ft. by 
guess, c/uncus triglumis and ^'rbutus UVa ursi were also seen 
in only one station, not actually measured. The lake at Kes- 
wick is estimated to be 228 ft. above the sea; that of Thirl- 
mere is nearly 500 ft. All the other species were seen at or 
nearly on the level of one of these lakes. The early period 
at which the hills were visited would no doubt prevent my 
seeing all the species towards their summits, in the hollows 
near to which some patches of snow still lingered at the end 
of May, but quite disappeared before the second week of 
June. Excluding the ferns, we have, above 3000 ft., only 13 
species ; between 2000 ft. and 3000 ft., 53 species ; and be- 
tween 1000 ft. and 2000 ft. there were 150, or more. Now, 
by observations in the highlands of Scotland last autumn (see 
Edinburgh New Philosophical JoJir?ial, No. 28.), there are at 
these heights on the Scottish mountains, 80, 183, and 273 
species. The small extent of surface elevated above 1000 ft. 
or 1500 ft. in the county of Cumberland, the dryness of the 

c 3 



22 Altitude of Habitats of Plants in Cumberland, 

mountain summits, and the comparative paucity of elevated 
valleys, deep chasms, and rocky precipices, will no doubt ex- 
plain the numerical deficiency in its mountain flora. Up to 
1000 ft. the vegetation of Cumberland is superior to that of the 
Scottish highlands. Above 2000 ft. the species are not only 
fewer, but, with all the advantage of a more southern latitude, 
they commonly fail much earlier as we ascend the hills. The 
average heights to which the species mentioned in the preced- 
ing lists were observed to attain in the highlands are, for the 
first (or those exceeding 3000 ft. in Cumberland), 3900 ft. ; 
for the second, 3200 ft. ; for the third, 2900 ft. ; for the fourth, 
2400 ft. By average height is meant the mean obtained by 
dividing the sum of the highest stations observed in Scotland 
by the number of species. 

Mr. Winch, to whom we are indebted for the fullest and 
most accurate lists of species and botanical notices for the 
county of Cumberland, has very recently printed a thin quarto 
pamphlet of Contributions to the Flora of Cumberland, in which 
are enumerated all except the commoner species said to have 
been found in the county ; but, from the author's remarks, it is 
pretty evident that many stations published on the authority 
of the late Mr. Hutton are errors, if not deserving of a harsher 
designation. Though I have verified many of the stations 
given by Winch, it is unnecessary to repeat them here ; and 
I shall, therefore, confine myself to those not included in his 
Contributions, and mention only the mountain species ; at least 
with a very few exceptions. 

C'lvcoda alpina. Between the Great Wood and Falcon Crag, 
&c. — Galium boreale. In plenty on the east side of Derwent- 
water. — Alchemilla alpina. Particularly plentiful about the 
Scawfell group of hills, as well as on the hills in crossing from 
the Vale of Newlands to Borrodale. — 'LohhMa Dortmann«. 
W^atendlath Tarn, and the small tarn among the hills above it. 
In most of the lakes. — Fiola liitea. Between Castlerig and 
Armboth, and on the north side of Latrigg. — Ribes petrae^um. 
Hedges of the fields between Ullock Moss and Braithwaite. 
— Z^ysimachia vulgaris. I believe to have seen this between 
Swinside Hill and Braithwaite. " Paterdale and Keswick, 
Hutchinson [?]. I could not find it in either of these places." 
Winches Contributions. — i^hamnus Frangula. Ullock Moss, side 
next to Swinside Hill. — Convallaria multiflora. Castle Head

station is flooded when the water is high. — - Juncus trigltimis. 
About half way up Helvellyn, ascending obliquely from the 
north end of Thirlmere. — Oxyria reniformis. Black Rocks 
of Great End, abundantly; ascending from the Vale of New- 
lands towards Borrodale, &c. — Epilobium crlsini folium. 
Ashnessgill and west side of Helvellyn. Not seen in flower, 
and the species not quite certain. — Faccinium Oxycoccos. 
Rare about Keswick. Only seen in a moss on the west side of 
the highest point of the road over Whinlatter. — Arbutus 
UVa lirsi. Descending Grassmoor to Crummoch Water ; 
rather on the Buttermere than the Scale Hill side. — >Saxi- 
fraga stellaris. Many hills from 1000 ft. to 3000 ft. — 
S. «iz()ides. Black Rocks of Great End abundantly, and other 
hills. — S, oppositif(Mia. Black rocks of Great End. The 
Black Rocks were so called by my guide. They are the 
walls of a deep ravine crossed in ascending direct to the sum- 
mit of Scawfell Pikes from Styehead Tarn, keeping the Wast- 
dale side of Great End, instead of the usual ascent by the 
upper tarn. They are near to, but not in, the Screes, where 
this species has been before found. — S. /zypnbides. Helvel- 
lyn, Great End, Grange, &c. — Silene acaulis. Black Rocks 
of Great End. Not in Winch's list. — -Kubus saxatilis. Hills 
between Thirlmere and Derwentwater. — Potentilla alpestris. 
On the steep rocks in ascending from the Vale of Newlands, 
over Grange Fell to Borrodale. Not in Winch's list. — 
yhalictrum alpinum. Ascending from Styehead Tarn to 
Sprinkling Tarn, but nearer to the latter; also ascending from 
the Black Rocks of Great End to Scawfell Pikes, I showed 
the former station to my guide, Moore, jun., of Keswick. 
Mr. Winch seems to doubt the species being found in the 
county, and probably this is the first authentic station. — 
Habenaria albida. Hills to the south of Watendlath Tarn ; 
between the latter and Borrodale, &c. — Carex rigida. On 
various hills, near their summits, as Saddleback, Helvellyn, 
Great End, Scawfell Pikes, Grisedale Pike, Grassmoor. 
Mr. Winch only mentions Sklddaw. — SnVix herbacea. Sum- 
mits of Helvellyn, Scawfell Pikes, Grisedale Pike, Grassmoor, 
&c. — Rhodiola rosea. Various rocks on Great End, Scaw- 
fell Pikes, Helvellyn, west side of Grange Fell, Grassmoor. — 
t/uniperus commiinis. Frequent on the hills. Within a few 
feet of the summit of Grisedale Pike, considered to be 2580ft. 
high. Winch, in his essay on the distribution of plants in the 
northern counties, mentions it as if rising only to 1500 ft.; but 
I saw it in various places above 2000 ft. The summit of 
Grisedale Pike was the highest station observed. In Forfar-

That true and elegant naturalist, Hurdis (an Oxonian), was 
he who said, — 

" Not a tree, 

A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains 
A folio volume; " 

and the proverbiality his saying has attained proves that the 
truth of its sentiment is generally felt. Mr. Baxter con- 
tributes not a little to illustrate its truth, not only in the above 
communication, but in the cheap and excellent periodical now 
in the course of publication, entitled Figures and Descriptions 
of one Species in a Genus of the Flowering Plants of Britain. 
In that work, a plurality of associations are drawn together 
and connected with each of the plants figured, and among 
these associations, not rarely a notice, from Mr. Baxter, of the 
species of fungus which have been found to inhabit the plants' 
leaves ami herbage, is supplied. — J, D. 

TJie common Berberry (Berberis vulgaris L.) is perfectly harm- 
less to the Crops of Wheat which may grow near it. (VI. 367.) 
— To Mr. Babington's pertinent practical fact (VI. 367.), 
illustrative of this assertion, I would add, that the parasitic 
fungus which diseases the leaves of the berberry is ^cidium 
Be7'beridis Persoon, and is in species and genus most distinct 
from the parasitic fungus, Puccini^ Graminis Persoon, which 
is frequently found infesting the herbage of crops of wheat. 
A figure of ^cidium Berberidis is given in Loudon's Fncy- 
clopccdia of Plants, p. 1045. No. 16676. ; and one of Puccinia 
Graminis in p. 1047. No. 16710. In hedgerows around corn 
fields in some neighbourhoods, plants of the berberry are not 
rare (by Shaker's Lane, near Bury St. Edmunds, as one in- 
stance) ; and it is probable that the charging on the berberry 
the diseasing of the wheat, or other corn, which has grown near 
it, has arisen from the likely case of the berberry being infested 
with its pai'asitic fungus, the ^cidium Berberidis Pers., at the 



Fucbides m the Ttmisition Rocks of North America, 27 

time the herbage of the wheat has been infested with its para- 
sitic fungus, the Puccinia Graminis ; a coincidence which, it is 
presumed, onght rather to be interpreted as pointing to certain 
foregone conditions of the atmosphere or soil, which promoted 
the growth and multiplication of the respective funguses con- 
temporaneously, each in its own appropriate soil, the leaves or 
herbage of the kind of plant in and on which it flourishes. 
That the fungus of the leaves of berberry can grow on the 
herbage of wheat, or the fungus of the herbage of wheat on 
the leaves of berberry, is an idea which the conclusions of 
science wholly repudiate. The first origin of the funguses, 
and their appointed agency, must be deemed identical, in time 
and source, with those of the largest of plants. — J. D. 



Art. VIII. A Description of a Fossil Vegetable of the Family Fu- 
c'dides in the Transition Rocks of North Aynerica, and some 
Considerations in Geology connected voith it. By R. C. Taylor, 
Esq. 

The accompanying drawing represents an interesting fossil 
which abounds in certain parts of the transition series in 
Pennsylvania. This plant was noticed, for the first time, in 
1831, under the name of Fucoides alleghaniensis, by Dr. 
Harlan, in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences 
of Philadelphia, 

Dr. Harlan's description of this fossil i^ucus is so applicable 
to the specimen before me, that I shall take the liberty of con- 
densing his account. " It presents one of the richest spe- 
cimens of vegetable organic remains that have hitherto come 
under my notice. Not only is the surface of the stone 
crowded with the forms of this plant, but they lie upon each 
other three or four layers deep, as is demonstrated by a hori- 
zontal fracture. They project in bold relief from the surface, 
with their distal extremities disposed in every direction ; they 
appear to have been of different ages, and vary in size, 
accordingly, from 2 in. to 5 in. in length, the largest being 
eight tenths of an inch in thickness. In breadth they vary 
from one to five tenths of an inch ; they are generally 
gently arched from the base towards the apex, and more or 
less recurved at top ; in every instance the apex is curved 
downwards, and sinks into the stone. The superior surface 
of both the stalk and branches is cylindrical, transversely 
wrinkled by irregular channels, and marked by a longitudinal 
and depressed line. The digitations or branches are all com- 
pressed laterally ^s well as the stalk, and are fasciculated or 



28 Fucoides in the Trmmtion Rocks 

closely applied side by side at the commencement, and gra- 
dually diverge towards their distal extremities. 

" In every case the stalks divide into two or more branches ; 
the latter are more or less wrinkled, apparently according to 
age, the rugae being more or less obsolete in the largest, pro- 
foundly developed in the smaller or younger specimens. The 
plants are fractured in many places and iu various directions; 
but the fractured portions do not display any evidence of 
organisation ; nor is there any appearance of leaves, nervures, 
or fructification." 

I believe that a fossil of this description has not been 
noticed in any part of the transition series in Great Britain ; 
yet, as some traces may be discovered through the aid 
afforded by an accurate illustration, I am induced to transmit 
some further notice of this fossil plant and of its geological 
position. 

Mr. De la Beche enumerates two or three species of Fu- 
coides in the grauwacke group of Europe. How near they 
may approach to the fossil which is so strikingly character- 
istic of apart of the same group in North America, I have no 
present means of ascertaining. The two species found in the 
transition limestone of Canada are dissimilar to the Fucoides 
alleghaniensis. 

The aggregate thickness of the grauwacke group is enor- 
mous in Pennsylvania; its breadth being about 120 miles, and 
its stratification being inclined at a very high angle, and often 
approaching to verticality, it is not improbable that the entire 
mass averages forty-five degrees. I have examined a large 
portion of this in detail, and have constructed a transverse 
section of about seventy miles, from which it appears that in 
about half this breadth the inclination of the rocks is towards 
the Alleghany chain, and in the other portion it is reversed. 
On the details of the subordinate portions of this group it is 
not my intention to enlarge. It is sufficient to observe, gene- 
rally, that they consist of arenaceous, slaty, and limestone 
rocks, subdivided into innumerable varieties of siliceous and 
argillaceous beds, conglomerates, shales, clays, marbles, flinty 
slate and flinty limestone ; and include numerous coal seams, 
both of anthracite and of the quality which may be termed 
bituminous anthracite, and large deposits of iron, both argil- 
laceous and haematitic. 

The surface of this region is broken into an infinite number 
of sandstone ridges and limestone valleys, all running parallel 
with the mountain chain of the \lleghany. 

These ridges are generally 700 or 800 feet above the 
valleys, and are incapable of cultivation. They are covered.

to the thickness of from 10 to 100 feet, with huge blocks of 
sandstone. Upon their steep sides few traces of vegetable soil 
exist ; yet the oak, the chestnut, the pines, and several other 
trees, Iiave obtained a firm footing, and have extended over 
the loftiest crests. Embarrassed with this accumulation of 
debris, the geologist seeks, almost in vain, for some exposed 
face, some unencumbered surface, to determine the arrange- 
ment and structure of these vast nnd singularly prolonged 
mn'^ses. He finds as much difFicully m viewing the details of 
their geological features, as in obtaining, from amidst the 
ancient forests which overshadow them, an uninterrupted vievv 
of the wide-spread landscape beneath his feet. 

I have observed Fucoides alleghaniensis, at points 150 miles 
remote from each other, in the sandstone ridges that occur 
parallel with the eastern side of the Alleghany Mountains ; but 
nothing resembling them can be detected in the intermediate 
limestone valleys. The subject of my sketch [Jig, 6.) was 




derived from the vicinity of this place [Lewistown], on the 
banks of the Juniata River, and in the same district from 
which Dr. Harlan's specimen was procured. Detached 
fragments, rolled from the mountains, and fallen slabs, exhi- 
biting fine specimens of this fossil, are not unfrequently met 
with amidst the talus of the ridges; but it is only very recently 
that the beds in which it occurs in situ came under my observ- 
ation. Under the conviction that these vegetable strata have 
hitherto escaped geological notice, I proceed to detail some 
circumstances relating to their position. 

After passing Lewistown, the Juniata flows easterly, for 



30 Fiicoides in the Tramition Rock 



rs 



about six miles, through " the Narrows;" that is, in a deep 
narrow trough between the two sandstone ridges of Shade 
Mountain and Black Log Mountain ; having, for the most 
part, barely space for its channel. The great western turn- 
pike road and the Pennsylvania Canal also pass through this 
ravine ; being, for some distance, excavated out of the base of 
the northern ridge, called Shade Mountain. In consequence 
of these public works, many of the inferior strata are here 
exposed ; and although, in the aggregate, they do not com- 
prise a thirtieth part of the entire elevation, they are highly 
interesting, in displaying beds of fossil i^iici in unexpected 
abundance. 

These beds, where I first saw them extensively intersected, 
consist of fine-grained compact white sandstone ; interstrati- 
fied with greenish argillaceous seams, and some laminae of 
black shale, both containing mica. Upon the upper surfaces 
of the argillaceous slabs are disposed innumerable groups of 
Fucoldes. Above these layers, other courses, covered with 
the same fossil plants, could be traced obscurely ; while masses 
of hard sandstone, whose figured surfaces bore rude resem- 
blance to the Gothic tracery of ancient sculpture, had evi- 
dently fallen from much more elevated sites. 

Pursuing the examination farther eastward, the beds of 
Fucoldes were again laid bare, by the canal excavations, to 
the height of 50 ft. above the Juniata. Here I counted seven 
courses of them, comprised within the thickness of 4 ft. Among 
the lower beds are some of white cherty sub-crystalline sand- 
stone, and others composed of micaceous schistose sandstone, 
whose upper surfaces were traversed by another species of 
Fucoldes, distinguished by their long curving stalks ; whilst 
upon other argillaceous slabs a third description of fossil jpuci 
crossed each other in straight lines, resembling network. It 
may be remarked, that no casts of shells, nor, indeed, any 
other organic body, occur with these deposits. 

At another point, three miles eastward of that where I com- 
menced tracing the i^cus beds, numerous seams of fine white 
sandstone, separated, as before, by thin courses of micaceous 
shale and clay, are exposed. Some idea of the rapid succes- 
sion of vegetable deposits will be conveyed, when it is men- 
tioned that eight or ten were numbered within the space of 
6 ft., some of them not exceeding 1 in. thick. The surface 
of Shade Mountain is too much obscured, by its thick covering 
of coarse debris, to enable an examination of its structure to 
be satisfactorily pursued ; but there is reason to conceive that 
these fossils occur at various elevations, besides those of which 
I have spoken. I have observed them at 100 ft., 150 ft., 



of North America. Si 

and at 500 ft. above the Juniata ; and specimens have even 
been obtained from the summit. 

The strata 1 have enumerated dip towards the north-west 
generally ; but local derangements have occasioned some par- 
tial curvatures and arching of the inferior strata, so as to 
occasion a variation from Sif N.W. to 60° S. The valley of 
the Juniata is remarkable for the singular contortions, on a 
large scale, of the strata upon its banks. 

Lower down the Narrows succeeds a variety of argillaceous 
beds, which furnish the flagstones for the side pavements of 
the town of Lewistown. The surfaces of these pavements 
are covered with irregular protuberances, evidently of vege- 
table origin, and, probably, another species of fossil ^'Igae. 
Beyond this point another series of strata occurs. These 
consist of red sandstones, interlaced with numerous veins of 
white quartz, and conglomerates of granulated quartz, inter- 
mixed with fragments of red micaceous slate. Even these 
rocks occasionally exhibit coarse impressions and casts of 
Fucbides. To these succeed thick deposits of black shale, 
having no trace of organic remains. 

The strata which I have thus briefly enumerated, although 
they form but an insignificant fraction of this immense series, 
present matter for the consideration of the speculative na- 
turalist. It has been seen that here occur many alternating 
beds of Fucbides, and, probably, several species of these 
fossil plants. Hence may be inferred the existence, at various 
epochs, of so many separate surfaces, on which vegetation 
flourished at the bottom of an ancient ocean. We thus ascer- 
tain that, in those remote times, there were frequent successions 
of these remarkable submarine plants, and many renewals of 
the argillaceous surfaces upon which they took root. But it 
does not appear that the consequence of these frequent 
changes was the obliteration or destruction of the organic 
forms of the vegetation so overwhelmed. The entire series, 
from the lowest bed even to the highest, appear to retain their 
original distinctness of outline. 

In the phenomena of deposition, and of recurring vegeta- 
tion we may, perhaps, trace some circumstances analogous to 
the formation of coal beds. 

The figure which illustrates this article represents a group 
of Fucbides, on a scale somewhat less than half their actual 
proportions [the drawing was about an inch too wide for our 
page]. An assemblage of these groups, ornamenting the sur- 
faces of large slabs, in clear relief, forms one of the most i*e- 
markable fossil productions of this continent. Imagine beds of 
these Fucbkles miles in extent, deposited, or rather accumu-

Art. IX. Remarks and Illustrations on the Decay of the Stems 
of succulent Plajits. By Frederick C. Lukis, Esq. 

The fossil vegetables which are found in the secondary 
formation, designated as coeval with the consolidation of the 
sandstone and coal measures, present to the eye of the ob- 
server patterns of great beauty and regularity, and display 
figures which have been often compared with the eccentric 
ornaments of ancient architecture. 

Without entering into the general geological hypothesis, 
much may be done, in the study of these interesting remains, 
by close investigation and analogy ; and, indeed, the nature of 
fossil vegetables must receive its principal elucidation from 
the careful examination of existing species analogous to them, 
when they can be found. 

The physiological botanist is well aware that plants in 
decay are disposed to shrivel up, each ir) a manner peculiar 
to its own class, and that this operation is governed by their 
internal as well as external organisation, and by the circum- 
stances under which they may be placed. 

As the greater number of our fossil plants have been 
referred to the ferns, cactuses, and other succulent analogues, 
it is among these we are to look for characters of resemblance ; 
and although many of these remains possess dimensions which 
baffle our conceptions, when brought in comparison with our 
pygmy tribes of the present economy, still the latter, in- 
significant as they appear, may afford us physiological types 
sufficiently clear to bring us near the truth. A series of 
observations made on the drying and decomposition of suc- 
culent plants has occupied my attention for many years, 
and I propose to notify some of the changes remarked in the 
stems and branches of the <Sempervivum arb^reum />., or 
tree houseleek, as it is called, in the course of their decay. 
They will suffice to show tlie variety of patterns which may 
be produced, under favourable circumstances, by a single 
individual of the succulent class. The result of decay 
in stems of this plant has been the production of exterior

markings, presenting a strong analogy to those of fossil plants ; 
and I may venture to say that, if casts had been taken from 
them, they would have been mistaken for real specimens of 
these interesting remains. 

The plants, when chosen for examination, were old, and of 
extremely luxuriant growth. The stems had acquired the 
size of a man's arm, and were about five feet in height. They 
were withdrawn from the hot-house during a sharp frost, by 
which they were soon killed. The leaves dropped off, leaving 
the rudiment more prominent and perfect than when their 
removal happened by natural decay. After the death of the 
plants, they were kept in the mould they occupied, and placed 
in a shaded situation, where decomposition was allowed to 
proceed slowly for the space of two years. During dry seasons 
they were occasionally watered, and the upper part of the 
stems was scooped out so as to admit moisture in the interior 
soft parts when required : thus a partial fermentation was con- 
tinued until the medullary substance became dissolved. 

The first change observable in the appearance of the epi- 
dermis was a disposition to form regular ridges or risings in 
the interstices between the marks left by the leaves and sub- 
spinous nerve near them, preserving a reticulated pattern. 
The hardness of the ligneous centre resisted decay for a long 
lime, and allowed the cortical covering to form its pattern 
with considerable exactness ; and at last, by its own shrink- 
ing, and the want of farther resistance from the nerve of 
spine and leaf, the covering contracted in a longitudinal 
direction, leaving the end of the wood projecting beyond the 
upper part of the plant. 

The following drawings of the plants, taken at different 
stages of decay, will be better understood than a lengthened 
description. 

Fig, 7. represents the common appearance of the stem, 
deprived of its leaves, before decay ; the tubercle and rudi- 
ment of the leaf, in quincuncial order, scarcely rising above 
the epidermis. 

Fig, 8. This figure shows the first angular depression 
round the tubercle and leaf, caused by the shrinking of the 
interior parts of the plant ; the dried state of the cortex 
opposing the contraction of its circumference. 

Fig, 9. is part of the same stem, contracting more equally 
downwards, it having been more under the influence of 
moisture than the lower end. It had now commenced a 
wavy and rhomboidal cancellated figure, the elevated ridges 
preserving an almost united wavy line from top to bottom.

a more decided pattern, by the completing of the above-stated 
rhomboidal depressions, which had been assisted by a longi- 
tudinal cut of a knife, and the careful removal of the woody 
centre.

Fig» 11. Other parts of the plant produced this pattern. 
It appeared that the spinous processes in the interior had 
resisted the vertical contraction of the cortex. Here the 
spaces retained an oblong form, having the elevated ridges 
prominent, though not united throughout their diagonal 
direction, but breaking into distinct approximate compart- 
ments, much in the same manner as those in the Phytolithus 
cancellatus. (Jig, 21.) 

Fig, 1 2. The most general appearance of the plants, where 
contraction was carried on more equally from both ends of

have arrived at the state of hay.

neous centre, or woody stem, in a fresh state.

Fig. 15. A longitudinal section of a branch, to show the 
disposition of the medulla, or pith, in the ligneous centre, 
where it forms transverse cells: the cortical cells or layers, 
running in a vertical manner, are traversed by the spinous 
nerve which produced the elevations in the epidermis. 

Fig. 16. represents the base of the stems of old plants. 
The epidermis becomes hard and leather-like, and is generally 
ruptured by the enlargement of the subspinous elevations. In 
the case under consideration, it formed lozenge- shaped open- 
ings round each tubercle, and retained a slight remain of the 
impression left by the original leaf across the tubercle. 

Fig. 1 7. In this last figure decomposition had affected the 
interior so as to enable the cortical covering to sink between 
the stiff prominent spines, which resisted decay with greater 
obstinacy ; thus forming rhombic compartments in a reversed 
order to what had taken place in the younger branches, as 
seen in Jig. 1 3 . 

A greater variety of figures might have been produced, 
but as many were the same in character, under a few modi- 
fications, and in progress of decay, I have chosen the most 
decided patterns only. Some interior changes in the epi- 
dermis, cutis, and ligneous centre presented very regular 
markings during the progress of decomposition and desic- 
cation. 

Fig. 18., taken from the inside surface of the epidermis of 
the largest stem, will suffice to show the various changes 
exhibited by a single plant : in this case the cortical })arts*, 
under the epidermis, had separated in macerating, and left it 
at liberty to produce this pattern, although the exterior 
surface was not much altered from the rest of the plant. 

In this figure the hollows were numerous and deeply marked. 
Over each a transverse, sharp, wavy, elevated line passed in 
regular succession; undoubtedly formed after its separation 
from the rest of the plant. These lines were not marked on

the outside of the epidermis, nor were they at all visible on 
the remains of the soft part which had been in contact with it. 

Fig, 19. is a portion of the stem, or lig7mm, from which, 
when perfectly dry, its bark has been removed by peeling. It 
formed a hard and tough cylinder, of moderate thickness, 
the longitudinal striae being only interrupted by the slightly 
elevated spots which held the spinous nerves as they emerged 
from the wood, and then passed through the bark, where they 
formed the external rugoe. Tliat part of the bark which 
immediately covered the wood retained the same impressions 
on its surface, but that in contact with the epidermis had 
large tubercles corresponding with the outside of the plant; 
but in no case did this portion of the bark exhibit a pattern 
dissimilar from it. 

In fossil plants it has been remarked that the same species 
may appear under three different states; such as are produced 
by the epidermal, cortical, and ligneous configurations : the 
first and the last differing much from each other ; and, as 
Mr. Parkinson states, " it is only close observation that deter- 
mines that it originates from the same plant." 

Assuming that fossil succulent plants have undergone 
changes similar to those here represented, either before they 
were lodged in their matrix, or when so embedded, it will be 
easily perceived that one species may appear under several 
aspects difficult to determine. It is not improbable that, 
during the progress of maceration in the matrix, a variety of 
circumstances may have occurred to favour these changes and 
variations. 

In contrasting these observations with what is visible in the 
submarine peat found in these islands, many indications point 
out a similar decomposition to be going on ; and although 
these trees and vegetables have been buried many centuries, 
and are of a different description from those under notice, yet 
they exhibit changes nearly as diilficult to recognise.

On referring 
to Parkinson's 
Outlines of O- 
ryctology (the 
only work near 
at hand on the 
subject), he 
there states, 
when treating 
of the Phyt6- 
lithus verru- 

_ census (j%.20.)j 

that this fossil was a plant of the succulent tribe, differing 
from vegetables of the present world by its containing a more 
solid part within its succulent substance, from which proceeded 
a delicate organisation, by which a communication was pre- 
served with the external surface." He further adds : — "It 
also appears that the species of this genus, distinguished by 
their characteristic markings, may have been numerous ; that 
the different situations in which the internal part is found in 
different fossils are attributable to the resolution of the ten- 
derly organised intermediate part, connecting the included 
substance with the surface, and to the other accidents depend- 
ent on partial and irregular decomposition, pressure, and 
distortion, occurring during its passage from the vegetable to 
the mineral kingdom." 

M. Steinhauer has also remarked, in speaking of the 
Phytolithus cancellatus {fg, 21.), " that the first or epidermal

configuration is formed of rhombs, divided by lines forming 
a network in a manner difficult to express by drawings or

description, which leaves the rhomhs still appioximate ;" he 
again adds: — " In the ligneous, the cancellated appearance is 
here entirely lost^ the surface is slightly striated, with a scarcely 
perceptible rising under the central ridge, and a minute but 
distinct raised dot in the place of the depression in the epider- 
mis. It has all the appearance of a peeled plant, which had 
been furnished with small branches or spines in quincuncial 
order." M. Steinhauer also remarks, " that these plants 
were furnished in the centre with a pith of a structure diflfer- 
ing from the surrounding wood or cellular substance, more 
dense and distinct at the older end of the plant." 

Comparing these statements with the appearance of the 
plants under review, a strong analogy will be observed be- 
tween them, tending in some degree to elucidate this obscure 
subject, and bringing their variety of configurations nearer to 
our minds. It may be found interesting to those who have 
not examined the diiFerent states of the same plant while 
under decay, and may prevent the multiplying the number of 
species, whose only difference, perhaps, exists in the degrees 
of decomposition of the same plant.

Art. X. A Notice of some important Geological Discoveries at 
Billesdon Coplotv, Leicestershire ; ivith Observations on the Na- 
ture of their Relation to the modern System of Geology, By 
Joseph Holdsworth, Esq. 

In contemplating the numerous theories of the earth's struc- 
ture and materials, which have from time to time been advanced 
by men of profound minds, one cannot but be struck with the 
discrepancy of those ideas and opinions which, like the ebul- 
litions of fancy, have successively triumphed and radiated with 
an effulgent brightness, until the discovery of some new, some 
simple unexpected fact, some sad reality, has consigned them, 
in succession, to oblivion. 

Much, very much, however, has undoubtedly been achieved ; 
many luminous discoveries have been made, and many sur- 
prising truths have been established, by the meritorious exer- 
tions of the scientific, as is sufficiently exemplified in the 
modern system of geology. This system, however, notwith- 
standing \t is countenanced by many of the most scientific 
characters of the age, may be far from the climax of perfection ; 
and the warmest advocates of it even admit that it is liable to 
many weighty objections. Indeed, the complex, the multi- 
farious, the extraordinary diversity everywhere observable in 



and their Relation to the modern System of Geology, 39 

the terraqueous arcana of nature, laugh at the poverty of our 
ideas, and mock the futile efforts of man to reduce them to 
system, or to effect anything approaching to a faithful delinea- 
tion of so mighty, so mystical and magnificent a prototype. 

Notwithstanding this, there are certain individuals v^^ho, in 
their anxiety to preserve inviolate adopted principles and pre- 
conceived notions, treat with disdain or levity such actual cir- 
cumstances as do not happen to accord with their prepos- 
sessions, and thereby evince a disposition to give, rather than 
to receive, the laws of nature. Certain geological discoveries 
which I have recently made in this district, and of which a 
short account is published in Taylor's London and Edin- 
burgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science^ vol. iii. 
p. 76. 112., 1833), have met with instances of this kind of re- 
ception ; and on this account, as well as by the advice of some 
eminent literati who have examined the discoveries, I am in- 
duced to solicit the farther attention of the unprejudiced 
scientific to them and to their bearing on the existing system 
of geology. 

This system originated in the labours of Mr. Wm. Smith, 
an English surveyor, who in 1790 published his Tabular 
Views of the British Strata ; in which he proposed a classi- 
fication of the secondary formations in the west of England, 
and contended that the order of different groups is never in- 
verted, and that these groups may be identified at very dis- 
tant points, by the presence within them of fossils of a deter- 
minate structure, peculiar to each. According to the order of 
superposition and marks of identification prescribed by Mr. 
Smith (admitting the infallibility of the latter in the present 
case), it appears, from the occurrence of the GryphaeV in- 
curva and Pentacrinites Briareu5 in the site of my trial for 
coal, that it is in the stratum which science denominates lias, 
and is situated about five miles from the eastern edge or ex- 
tremity of the red marl. The last-named stratum, according 
to Mr. Smith's doctrine, reposes upon coal measures, and dips 
under the lias clays ; consequently, if Mr. Smith's doctrine be 
true, and we assume the undisturbed presence of the above 
beds in this district, the lias and red marl formations must be 
penetrated before the old coal formation can be reached. The 
mean thickness of each of the two former strata is, according 
to the calculation of some geologists, about 500 ft. ; the thick- 
ness varying extremely in different districts, even down to six 
or ten feet, and, in some cases, one or both of the beds are 
entirely wanting. At the Glutton Ridge pits, the red marl 
is, in some places, thirty fathoms deep, and in others but ten. 

1 will not stop here to question the correctness of the theory 

D 4 



40 Geological Discoveries at Billesdon Coplow, 

which ascribes to every distinct stratum a new order of organic 
beings, nor dwell upon the unanticipated facts which my prac- 
tical efforts have brought to light in this locality ; but, in actual 
consistency with Mr. Smith's theory, I will proceed to adduce 
a few of the many instances which have occurred in this 
kingdom of the successful penetration, even from the surface 
of the oolite, to the carboniferous strata or independent coal 
formation. As instances : Paulton Hill, near High Littleton, 
Gloucestershire, is topped with oolite, beneath which is a 
bed of lias ; then the newer red sandstone or marl, and finally 
the pennant or coal seams, at a moderate depth. In another 
part of the same county, the thickness of these beds, which 
lie above the coal, is as follows ; — Oolite, 6 yards ; lias 53 
yards ; red marl, 44 yards: in all, 103 yards to the coal form- 
ation. Coal is equall}^ accessible through these formations near 
the Mendip Hills, and in some parts of Wales, &c. In the 
above districts, as in all others, the various superstrata of the 
carboniferous formation vary much in thickness, in compara- 
tively short distances. The Walton pit, a short distance east 
of Glutton, and near to Midsummer Norton, descends through 
the red ground, containing shaly limestone, in which fossils 
abound, and through the like order of mill grit, shale, and 
sandstone, to the depth of 200 fathoms, where the main bed 
of coal occurs. These instances sufficiently demonstrate the 
probability of the existence of coal in this place, at an obtain- 
able or definite depth, especially when we take into account 
its proximity to the red marl and newly discovered coalfields 
to the west, and distant hence about fifteen miles in a direct 
line ; and, additional to these considerations, we may reason- 
ably calculate upon the latent existence, and consequent 
assistance, of some of those wise ordinations of Providence 
termed faults, by means of which the coal of very extensive 
fields is found to be, in many instances, thrown near the sur- 
face, when otherwise it would, in consequence of its natural 
dip, soon be out of the reach of the miner. 

In the vicinity of these natural intersections (the consequences 
of subterranean convulsions), vast stratified masses, several miles 
square, are found to have been upheaved from very consider- 
able depths. From among hundreds of instances of this case on 
record, I may here adduce two or three in illustration : — The 
coal formation of Ashby Wolds is a curiously denudated mass, 
entirely surrounded by the red marl, which (if it existed prior 
to the catastrophe) appears to have fled from its assigned geo- 
logical destination, when the volcanic thunders shook the mi- 
neral treasures of its sub-neighbours, and summoned them to 
approach nearer to the light of heaven. The coal measures of 



and their Relation to the modern System of Geology. 41 

Tamwortb, and some others in the red marl, assum^e precisely 
the same insulated character ; but the systematist affirms that 
these anomalous masses are peculiar to the red marl. Since, 
however, he attributes them to igneous causes, whose bounds 
no lines of demarcation can prescribe, whose power and 
universality no mortal dare presume to dispute, may we not 
reasonably infer that immense stratified masses have been 
subjected to the same mighty causes, not only throughout the 
whole of this kingdom, but in the remotest regions of the 
globe? So recently as the 9 th of November, 1822, an earth- 
quake happened in Chile, South America, which furnishes an 
amazing example of the extensive effects of the tremendous 
explosive powers by whose agency such awful catastrophes 
are operated. Mrs. Graham, who was an eye-witness of the 
above, relates that, " on the morning of the 20th, it appeared 
that the whole coast, from north to south, to the distance of 
above one hundred miles, had been raised above its former 
level ; at Valparaiso, the alteration of level was about three 
feet, and at Quintero about four feet. She found good reason 
to believe that the coast had been raised by earthquakes, at 
former periods, in a similar manner ; several ancient lines of 
beach, consisting of shingle mixed with shell, extending, in a 
parallel direction to the shore, to the height of fifty feet above 
the sea." These phenomena may be regarded as of frequent 
occurrence in the formations of all ages, and as indicating the 
most effective of the numerous disturbing causes by which the 
earth's surface has been affected. 

I am prepared to show the igneous effects of these revolu- 
tionising catastrophes in the vicinity of Billesdon Coplow. At 
an apparent fault, which intersects the southern extremity of 
the Coplow basin, where many of its deep measures are pro- 
miscuously thrown up, are found large masses of fused mat- 
ter, muscle shells, coal, and oyster shells, in conglomerated 
masses; fragments of fir trees, partly carbonised and striated 
with sulphur; all evidently having been subjected to the 
powerful action of fusible heat. From what I have adduced 
respecting the universality of lands uplifted by subterranean 
convulsions, and from the signs of these convulsions having at 
some remote period exercised their powerful and mystical 
effects in this district also, is it not reasonable to infer that im- 
mense anomalous masses are as likely to expand their denu- 
dated bosoms in the centre of the lias marls, oolitic, or other 
ranges, as they are well known to do within the limits of the 
red marl ? However, there can be no necessity for resorting 
to such violent hypothesis, as the instances we have quoted 
are sufficiently in point to warrant fully (with a full and un- 



4?2 Geological Discoveries at Billesdon Coplow, 

compromised admission of the undisturbed order of super- 
position of the British series of strata) the conclusion that 
coal may be reached and worked to advantage from the sur- 
face of the lias, and even oolitic, ranges of this kingdom. But 
however powerfully and clearly the inferences drawn from the 
general laws of an established science may tend to justify 
such a decision, the prudential calculator and nice observer of 
nature's laws would certainly not feel himself justified in the 
adoption of expensive practical experiments to prove the real 
existence of an object which natural deductions, derived from 
theoretical principles, had shown to be probable. " No;" he 
would naturally enough say, " I must first be convinced, by 
indubitable evidence, of the real merits and stability of this 
grand and orderly structure which the inductive spirit of 
modern geology has called into being; and even then, before 
I proceed to act upon principles of so general and comprehen- 
sive a character, I shall require a mass of actual evidence (of 
a local nature) perfectly analogous to those infallible criteria 
which are known to direct and reward the researches of the 
practical geologist and mineral explorer." Such, I confess, 
were the sentiments which dictated my examination for coal 
strata in this hitherto untried district. 

I will now proceed to consider whether or not the disco- 
veries already made are calculated to affect or confuse the 
order of superposition of the British series of strata, so sys- 
tematically arranged by modern science, and also endeavour to 
demonstrate the presence of valuable coal strata in this dis- 
trict, by existing evidence, of such an incontrovertible nature 
as, I flatter myself, cannot fail to remove the prejudices of the 
most determined sceptic. 

The marks of identity by which the respective formations 
are distinguished, and their geographical extent ascertained, 
are, as I have before observed, the fossil exuviae they indi- 
vidually contain. Such being the case, I would ask the 
founders of the existing system to account, by reasonable in- 
ferences, for the assemblage here of the Cirrus acutus of the 
mountain limestone ; the Pecten fibr5sus of the under oolite ; 
the Trigonia costata of the upper ; the Mytiloides labiatus, 
from the chalk and superior strata ; with madrepores, muscles, 
corals, and oysters from the coal formation, found, apparently, 
not in the diluvium or adventitious deposits, but in the regular 
strata, constituting a part and portion of the ponderous form- 
ation denominated lias ? 

In relation to this question, I shall here introduce an extract 
from the Rev. Mr, ScutclifFe's Geology of the Avon (p. 24.): — 
" With regard to organic remains, the marble, often alternating 



and their Relatmi to the modern System of Geology. 43 

to magnesian limestone, the shaly limestone, and the oolite, 
contain the genera, the families, and species of shellfish, ma- 
drepores, coralites, encrinites, pentacrinites, far beyond what 
scientific men have attempted to distinguish. Mr. John 
Walcott has very accurately painted and engraved about sixty 
shells, besides leeches, bones, and palates ; Mr. Sowerby, in 
his beautifully coloured work on shells, has published many 
others : but these do not contain the fourth part of the spe- 
cies which exist in gentlemen's cabinets. This science, which 
merits the most enlightened classifications and the best powers 
of the pencil, is yet in a state of infancy. But of seeing it 
brought to perfection one can have little hope ; learned men 
having unaccountably committed themselves, by contending 
that in every fresh order of strata we meet with an entire fresh 
order of extraneous fossils. It is granted, at once, that we do 
meet with such order ; for the works of the Creator are im- 
mense. We meet, also, with fresh plants in every continent. 
Nevertheless, in all these fresh orders of strata, we meet with 
many shells and plants found nearly in all the other orders. 
These are facts founded on personal examination and the 
severest scrutinies. These are facts which command the judg- 
ment, and must eventually supersede the contumacy and novelty 
of our modern theories. No man will surely tell us that the 
belemnites, the ammonites, the ostracites, the trochites, the 
nautilites, and the gryphites, found in the lowest strata of 
the alum shale of Yorkshire are of a totally different order 
from those of the same name in this district, and in the chalk 
and limestone ranges of the south of England. I have seen 
three of the Yorkshire ammonites, which differ from those 
of the south ; one of which had mouldings on the whole spiral 
coil, resembling the edges of the oak leaf." 

Of vegetable fossils, embedded in the same mass, many 
occur ; some of a species of fir, and of other dicotyledonous 
woods; also detached leaflets of the osmund filicite upon 
nodules of ironstone, and other vegetable impressions upon 
the sandstones (found on the spot where the coal and its con- 
comitants crop out to the surface) ; which fossils are described 
by geologists as belonging to the old coal formation. To 
these I may add the extraordinary circumstance of the pre- 
sence of an immense number and great variety of tropical 
fruits, with knots of wood, and other vegetable fossils, found 
in a most perfect state, embedded in the regular stratifications, 
about fifteen feet from the surface of the earth, and on the 
spot where the boring for coal was performed. These fossils 
have been pronounced fruits of a tropical climate by many 
eminent scientific men in London and Edinburgh, where they 



44 Geological Discoveries at Billesdon Coplow, 

have been shown, and are universally allowed by the initiated 
to be the first discovered within the lias range. The records 
of geology furnish us with a description of a similar discovery 
of the organs of fructification belonging to a tropical climate 
being made in that division of the British strata (superior to 
the chalk) termed the London clay, which is, according to the 
present system, a deposit of a much more recent epoch than 
the lias. In reference to these fossils, which were found in the 
Isle of Sheppey, the following remarks are extracted from 
Conybeare's Geology of England : — " The evidence of a neigh- 
bouring region of dry land seems attested by these vegetable 
remains, which, from the state in which they are found, can 
scarcely be supposed to have been drifted from any great dis- 
tance. . . We can scarcely resist the temptation of asking. 
What was that ancient land ? Had any part of England 
then raised its head above the waves ? Does it not sound 
extravagantly, even to enquire whether its oldest and highest 
mountain tracts then formed a group of spice islands , fre- 
quented by the turde and the crocodile? Speculations like 
these, though unavoidably suggested, almost give the features 
of romance to the sober walks of science." 

According to the author above quoted, beginning with the 
coal formation as the plane of superposition, the lias is the 
second, and the London clay the fifteenth in the geological 
series of English strata ; consequently, according to the doc- 
trine of the relative ages of strata, a series of epochs transpired, 
or geological catastrophes performed their respective revo- 
lutionising effects on the face of this country, during the im- 
mense period which intervened between the formation of the 
lias and London clays. Now, bearing in mind the data (fos- 
sils) from which these inferences are drawn, the following 
queries naturally suggest themselves: — How are we to account 
for the presence, in strata deposited subsecutively to the car- 
boniferous strata, of some of the identical fossils (of tropical 
origin) which characterise the carboniferous formation ? From 
whence came, and at what particular epoch flourished, the 
tropical organs of fructification, &c., found in the lias ? What 
are we to infer from the circumstance of analogous vegetable 
products of the same climate being found embedded in strata 
supposed to be formed at periods so remote as is ascribed to 
the deposition of the submedial and superior formations ? 

Whilst indulging in such speculations as the above, we 
have, for argument's sake, admitted the modern doctrine of a 
series of subaqueous catastrophes and progressive changes 
having, in the course of an immeasurable space of time, coated 
the globe with regular and well-defined strata, whose order of 



and their Relation to the modem System of Geology. 45 

superposition is never inverted, and, being countless in 
number, her incalculable age is, of course, understood. But 
the mind, in its eager pursuit after secondary causes (for- 
getting the First Great Cause), is speedily lost and confounded 
in a labyrinth of soaring conjectures and humiliating reflections; 
and truly, then, " may the sober walks of science be said to 
assume the features of romance." But, if we refer to the 
sublime and consistent records of the inspired writer for 
assistance, the daring phantasm of system vanishes into thin 
air, under the profound declarations of the sacred page. 
Moses, in speaking of the grand catastrophe whose impetuous 
waters overwhelmed the primitive world and its inhabitants 
(of which event we have such abundant evidence), declares 
that " the windows of heaven were opened, and the fountains 
of the great deep were broken up," and that " the high hills 
under tire whole heavens were covered;" and he further 
affirms that the great turmoil of waters " prevailed," or, in 
other words, continued their impetuous course, for a space of 
270 days around the nucleus of the revolving globe. Surely 
such a mighty circumfluent mass would be quite sufficient to 
produce, during the above period (under the energy and 
guidance of Him whose " spirit moved upon the face of the 
waters ; " who said, '^ Let there be light, and there was light ; " 
whose creative fiat willed all things into being), the whole 
of the terrestrial formations, with the peculiarities ascribed to 
each ; all the astounding phenomena which the philosopher 
labours in vain to define ; all the magnificent framework of 
the world, so greatly to be admired for the beauty and diver- 
sity of its materials, and for the provident and orderly arrange- 
ment of its structure. The Rev. Mr. Scutcliffe observes (in 
his valuable geological essays), that " the Mosaic theory of 
stratifying the earth, by the long-continued action of tre- 
mendous tides, is the only one which can correct the contra- 
dictory theories of geologists, and illustrate the phenomena of 
the stratified earth." He also remarks, " that whatever earths 
the impetuous tides of the deluge washed from one place, 
they must, of necessity, deposit in another. This is an inva- 
riable law of the ocean. Hence, one tide would bring gravel 
and marine exuviae, already worn by the action of the billows 
rolling on the shore ; another would bring sand, and another 
clay. But though all alluvial strata were formed of the de- 
tritus of the old earths, they would repeat the first formation, 
by combination ; they would change into a variety of silica, 
rocks, marls, and minerals ; while others, falling on more 
neutral earths, would remain in their primitive state. Thus, 
also, the deeper strata of the earth would be laid on while the 



46 Geological Discoveries at Billesdo?i Coplo^v, 

waters were rising; and all the more loamy earths by the 
gradual retreat and subsiding of the waters. These long- 
continued actions and deposits of the water are a sure guide 
in accounting for all the conformations and heterogeneous 
masses found in most parts of the alluvial earth." 

Thus, with the semblance of truth on our side, and reason 
for our guide, we may unhesitatingly infer that the tropical 
fruits, plants, and other fossils, which we find so indiscrimi- 
nately scattered in the submedial, medial, and superior strata of 
geologists (and many others, which may also arise from their 
fossil tombs, at some distant day, to prove the fallibility of 
modern theories), were upborne to their respective destinations 
by the levelling floods of the Noachian deluge ; and, conse- 
quently, are, like the strata in which they are embedded, of 
contemporaneous origin ; and were, in all probability, deposited 
at a period when no portion of England had raised its head 
above the waves. May we not also fairly surmise that the 
sportive element, which had arbitrarily disposed of the fossil 
exuviae, would also, by a succession of retiring tides, leave, in- 
discriminately, its vast flotillas of the uprooted spoils and 
refuse of the antediluvian forests in the deeper recesses of the 
earth, in the insulated situations they now occupy'in the charac- 
ter of coals ; and of the immediate existence of which we have 
certain inftiUible indications, ordained by the all-wise Director 
and Disposer of all created things for the direction and assist- 
ance of the " practical explorer ; " who, by the evidence of 
these indications has l^een led to the discovery of those im- 
mense treasures which have proved the mainspring of the 
activity, prosperity, and glory of the British nation. 

I will now proceed to show that " local indications" are to 
be found in this district, presenting their silent but iyicon- 
trovertihle testimonies of the immediate presence of mineral 
riches, concealed here, in the subjacent regions of the earth. 
Passing over the numerous veins, detached masses of smuts 
and coal (as being indicative, only upon more general prin- 
ciples, of a coal neighbourhood) so numerously scattered 
throughout the diluvium or compound beds which principally 
constitute the multifarious undulations of this (the eastern) 
division of Leicestershire ; the first thing worthy of notice is 
the circumstance of the vestigia of coal, and all its concomi- 
tants^ being found, generally speaking, immediately below the 
surface of the ground, in one continuous line, traversing this 
field in a direction due N.E. and S. W. ; five miles of which 
have been minutely explored by myself, and its real character 
and importance ascertained and declared by several expe- 
rienced scientific and practical men. From the outcrop, these 



and their Relation to the modern System of Geology. 4-7 

measures decline rapidly to the S.E. ; but in traversing the 
lower grounds, where the greater portion of them have been 
actually proved, by boring, to lie in regular stratified order, 
they dip but about five inches in the yard to the above point 
of the compass. In regard to the quantity of coal, I may 
adduce the single fact of the vestigia of certain of its conco- 
mitants, of considerable thickness (say from three to eighteen 
feet), proved in the deep, being found throughout the whole 
of the longitudinal line of the bassets, bearing a propor- 
tion short of the coal vestigia there scattered. Reasoning 
from this fact*, in conjunction with coexisting evidence, it is 
demonstrable to a certainty that the latter are portions of 
a very considerable and valuable stratum of coal, occupying 
its individual station, as a part of the mass of stratification 
partially explored, and whose bassets, or vestigia, were evi- 
dently deposited at the same period and by similar means. 
As a concurrent proof that these vestigia have been carried 
but an extremely short distance from their respective beds, 
I need only remind the initiated (who are aware of the ex- 
traordinary chafing or decomposing power which impetuous 
waters exert upon some of even the hardest minerals brought 
from any distance) that the various freestones, shales, coal, 
&c., found at the crop, are not in the slightest degree worn by 
attrition : even of the binds, which are of an extremely friable, 
tender, and soluble nature, I have numerous specimens, whose 
angles and asperities are of the most acute description. 

About 400 yards beyond the first basset another coal 
appears to the day ; which, in some places, has been discovered 
two feet thick, and also accompanied by its immediate con- 

* An exactly analogous line of coal vestigia, and all its concomitants, 
varying from about 10 yds. to 30 yds. wide, traverses the new Leicester- 
shire coalfield, in a dh-ection due N.E. and S. W. j which vestigia are 
thrown up to the surface through the red marl formation ; a very con- 
siderable thickness of which entirely conceals the superficies of the sub- 
strata (carboniferous) over a great extent of country. The important cha- 
racters of these bassets were first noticed, examined, and appreciated by 
Mr. Williamson (an experienced practical coal discoverer and miner), who, 
placing that implicit confidence in them which experience in exactly similar 
evidence (or laws of nature) had taught him to entertain, was thereby 
encouraged to persevere in a long and tedious trial (by boring) for coal in 
Bagworth Lordship (made a few hundred yards to the west of the above 
line), which, after penetrating through about 103 yards of red marl, ulti- 
mately led to the discovery of the vast stores of coals now working there ; 
and other collieries subsequently opened in the immediate vicinity. Ac- 
companied by Mr. Williamson, the discoverer of the above coalfield, I have 
recently traced and very minutely examined the aforenamed carboniferous 
bassets, and found them, in every peculiar and esse?itial character, precisely 
analogous to those which traverse this district. 



48 Geological Discoveries at Billesdoii Coplow, 

comitants, and resting upon a chinch, the usual pavement of 
coal : this has also an almost vertical dip to the S.S.E. Here, 
as in the first bassets, confusion and disorder are apparent; 
but this, as Williams asserts, in his History of the Mineral 
Kingdom^ is common to all strata which, as in this instance, 
come in contact with the base of hills or other previously 
formed elevations. 

In reference to the measures proved by boring, it may be 
necessary to state, that men of unquestionable judgment have 
not only recognised them as the identical strata represented 
by their vestigia at the surface or line of bassets, but pro- 
nounced them to possess, collectively, precisely the same 
mineralogical characters, &c., which so definitely distinguish 
the old coal formation. It may be important to remark, that, 
in the course of our penetrating the upper beds of this form- 
ation, marine exuviae were found tolerably abundant, but de- 
creased until we arrived at, apparently, the old coal formation, 
where they entirely disappeared, and were succeeded by those 
of vegetables alone. The carbon, which gradually increased 
in the measures, was, in the last * fifteen or twenty yards, ex- 
tremely abundant ; indeed, quite equal in quantity (as proved 
by the common process of washing) to any of the strata in 
the immediate vicinity of the coal beds of the explored coal- 
fields. This lower series also contained two or three thin 
veins of coal, commonly called breeders. Can any thing be 
more clearly demonstrative of the total absence of the red 
marl (in this vicinity) from its assigned geological position ? 
However, there appears nothing extraordinary in this circum- 
stance, when we take into consideration the extremely variable 
thickness of all the secondary formations, and particularly the 
red marl, or new red sandstone, which, it is well known, is 
frequently found terminating abruptly, forming thin beds, or 
swelling into considerable thickness, in the comparatively 
short space of a square mile or two. 

To revert to the fact of the bassets of the coal and all its 
concomitants, accompanied by the characteristic fossils of the 
old coal formation, traversing this district in a direct line: 
whether they result from igneous or aqueous causes ; whether 
they are calculated to break or disarrange the concatena- 
tions of the modern system, or whether they can be recon- 
ciled thereto, I leave to the learned to determine. That the

more than 100 fathoms, it was unfortunately terminated by the introduc- 
tion, by some malicious person, of a quantity of iron and steel into the 
boring-hole. 



a7id their Relation to the modei'n Syitem of Geology, 4. 3 

facts are substantial and stubborn ones, I am fully prepared to 
prove, and I shall also be most happy to give ocular demon- 
stration of all that I have advanced respecting the geology of 
this neighbourhood. 

In the contemplation of unanticipated or mipalatable truths, 
the determined sceptic and uncompromising systematist should 
ever bear in mind that there are many phenomena in the mag- 
nificent arcana of nature which the accumulated wisdom of 
ages, even to the end of time, shall fail to demonstrate ; that 
*' the book of nature," as Bishop Pontoppidan observes, " con- 
tains many leaves which no mortal ever yet perused ;" and, 
consequently, it behoves the votaries of system, who aim at 
perfection, so to construct their scientific temples that the 
admission of any of the unexplored truths contained in her 
sacred pages may not sap their foundation, nor disturb the 
general harmony of the structure. That this would be a 
hard task is admitted ; but, in contemplating the extreme jea- 
lousy and pertinacity sometimes evinced by the privileged few 
vi^ho are permitted to assume the banner of science, one can 
scarcely resist the inclination to indulge in such reflections. 
In a complex subject like geology, the abstruse disquisitions 
of the theoretic must ever remain subservient to the actual 
discoveries of the practical. However at variance such dis- 
coveries may happen to be with the previously adopted notions, 
prevailing opinions, or vested interests of individuals or socie- 
ties, they will ultimately, despite of every disparagement, pre- 
vail^ and find their way into the stores of public knowledge ; 
where unshackled liberal and inquisitive minds will appreciate 
them according to their worth, and where, perchance, they 
may occasionally merit to be received as new data, whereon 
to found speculations and enquiries which may ultimately 
tend to the farther developement of science and the extension 
of national wealth.

50 On an Aurora Bcn-calis 

Art. XI. Some Observations on a very interesting Aurora Borealis^ 
witnessed at Hull on the Evening and Night of October 12. 1833. 
By George H. Fielding, Esq. M.R.C.S.L., Member of the 
British Association for the Advancement of Science, Treasurer 
and Hon. Curator of Comparative Anatomy to the Hull Literary 
and Philosophical Society, «&c. &c. 

On the evening of Saturday, Oct. 12. 1833, we had the 
most brilliant exhibition of the aurora borealis I have ever 
seen. The evening was remarkably bright and clear; the 
sky presented a deep blue tint, and the stars were uncom- 
monly brilliant ; the air felt sharp, the temperature being 
about 40° ; the pressure of the atmosphere 29'832 ; the wind 
rather brisk, and from the north-west. At half past 8 p.m. 
there was a broad, irregular, semicircular belt of vivid white 
light, stretching across the northern hemisphere of the heavens. 
The span of the arch was from 70° to 80°, its upper edge 
reaching as far as the star Eta in Ursa Major, about 18° 
above the horizon ; and the breadth of the belt, which varied, 
I should state to be about 5°. It was exactly similar to a 
rainbow in shape, but of pure white light. 

Below the bow 1 at first thought there was a dark black 
cloud ; but, on minuter investigation, I found this to be a 
deception, caused by the extreme brilliancy of the aurora, 
which threw the surrounding medium into shade, and ob- 
scured the lustre of the fixed stars so much as to make them 
seem blue. By degrees the arch extended itself towards the 
zenith, and included the whole constellation of Ursa Major : 
it also gradually filled up the concavity down to the horizon, 
nntil it finally presented the magnificent appearance of an arc 
of an immense globe of fire. 

During the whole time of my observation, brilliant radii 
were shooting up towards the zenith from the convexity of the 
arch, sometimes broad, sometimes narrow, sometimes vanish- 
ing immediately, and at others remaining visible for a minute 
or more, to an altitude of 60° or 70°, and seeming like pillars 
of flame. The radii mostly disappeared at or before they had 
attained, an altitude of 90°, but might occasionally be traced 
in very narrow wavy streaks into the southern hemisphere. 

The most extraordinary appearance, however, was a rapid 
undulatory motion, accompanied with frequent brisk flashes *, 

* These flashes resembled, both in duration and colour, the silent light- 
ning frequently seen in the horizon on warm summer evenings, apparently 
at an immense distance, and when not a cloud is visible. 

I cannot but consider the aurora as an electrical phenomenon, and think 
that, were it not at such a remote distance, we should have explosions 
audible as in a thunder storm. This, however, is mere conjecture; but I 



recently witnessed at Hull, 



51 



which extended through the whole length of tJie curve. These 
immense flashes reached an altitude of 80° or 90°, and were 
often divided into numbers of square portions, or flashes, 
separated by broad dark lines. This singular phenomenon 
I should judge to be owing to the intervention of patches of 
dense vapour betw^een nie and the aurora; and, as not a cloud 
was visible during the interval between the flashes, and as the 
stars preserved their brilliancy, the height of the aurora must 
have been immense. 

As a diagram, however rough, excels description in these 
matters, I add a slight sketch {Jig» 22.) of the appearance 
when the square masses were given off*. 




I think the exhibition was the most splendid about 10 p.m., 
although it continued very beautiful till after 2 a. m. There 
was not the slightest corresponding appearance in the south, 
nor could I distinguish any sound I could attribute to the 
aurora : in fact, the latter is perhaps hardly to be expected, 
as the mean distance of the aurora from the earth, as cal- 
culated from the observations of twenty different philosophers 
in the same century, is, according to Sir Richard Phillips, 
500 miles; the distance observed varying from 100 to 1000 
miles. 

With respect to the very remarkable changes in the weather, 
and especially in the temperature, which immediately fol- 
lowed this certainly uncommon exhibition of the aurora in 
these latitudes, and which I am about to detail, a large share, 
in the absence of any other known cause, may fairly be attri- 
buted to this phenomenon. During the night the temperature 
fell to 34?°, being the lowest degree of cold I have registered 

hope soon to see the matter fully explained, as Captain Ross (whom I had 
the pleasure of seeing immediately on his arrival at Hull, after his long 
absence and perilous adventures) himself informed me he iiad obtained 
ample and satisfactory information respecting it and its causes.

this season : the barometer rose slightly. On the following 
morning, at nine o'clock, the northern hemisphere of the sky 
was studded with the mottled cirrostratus ; the wind was brisk 
from the west, but tending to the south ; the pressure of 
the air 30"096; the temperature 41*9°, being 7-2° lower than 
the preceding morning at the same hour. The temperature 
remained low the whole day, the sky wild, and the wind 
increasing until the evening, when it blew strong from the 
south-west in gusts, and was accompanied with showers of 
rain, the temperature increasing considerably. At nine a. m. 
the following morning the thermometer stood at 58*8°, being 
16*9° higher than the preceding morning: the barometer 
showed 29*4]?) being a fall of •679, or rather more than half 
an inch. The early part of the day was bright, with a fresh 
breeze from the south-west : at two p. m. it became overcast, 
and a heavy shower of rain fell : at night it blew strong from 
the south-west, accompanied with showers of rain, and once of 
hail. On the 15th, at nine a.m., the temperature was 46*1°, 
a decrease of 12-7° from the preceding morning: the baro- 
meter 29*132, and ultimately sinking to 29*118. These 
great and sudden differences in temperature are very uncom- 
mon at this time of the year, and actually greater than many 
of the same parallel hours in June and January of the present 
year, as I have found by referring to my own observations.

were, in December, 1832, trapped on a large rabbit-warren, 
near Thetfbrd [and, it may be assumed, from Mr. Hoy's 
heading, on the Suffolk side of this town, which itself is just 
within the boundary of the county of Norfolk]. They had 
been observed for some time in the neighbourhood. One of 
the eagles carried a heavy trap a considerable distance, I 
believe, nearly half a mile, and was secured with some diffi- 
culty. One was apparently in its first year's plumage : the 
other, from its lighter-coloured feathers, and the tail-feathers 
possessing much more white, was probably a year older. They 
were both presented to me by G. Gardiner, Esq., of Thetford.

They are the very birds to which the remarks and query (VI, 
448.) of H. T. of Bury St. Edmunds relate. 

A Goshawk {A^stur palumbdrms\ an adult male bird, in 
most beautiful plumage, was, on March 16. 1833, caught by 
a gamekeeper of Sir Joshua Rowley, Bart., of Stoke Nay land, 
in a trap baited with a red-legged partridge, which it had 
killed. I believe its capture to be an exceedingly rare occur- 
rence in this part of the kingdom. I am not aware of more 
than two or three instances of the goshawk's being killed in 
the southern parts of Britain ; and, in those instances, I am 
inclined to suspect they might be birds escaped from falconers, 
as the goshawk has been trained and flown, at no very distant 
date, in the counties of Norfolk, Cambridge, and Herts, in 
which counties also the specimens were killed. 
The Merliii [Falco lE/salon) seen. 
The Peregrine Falcon [Falco peregrmus) seen. 
The Hawfinch (Fringilla Qoccothraustes) [VI. 520., and, in 
addition to the references there given, III. 436.] visited 
us in small flocks, and many were seen and shot in different 
parts of the county. Although the whitethorn berries were 
abundant, the seeds of the sycamore and maple appeared to be 
their favourite food, more particularly those of the sycamore. 
A flock of eight or ten frequented some plantations near 
Ipswich during a great part of the winter, and seemed to feed 
almost entirely on the sycamore seeds. They were shy, and 
difficult of approach. 

Siskins {Fri?igilla Splnus) were very abundant through the 
winter, feeding principally on the seeds of the alder.

pended from the bough of a tree, where it had been placed by 
the person who had shot it. Atkinson, in his Compendium of 
British Ornithology, mentions a bird of this species being 
killed in Somersetshire a few years since. 

Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) were shot in the same planta- 
tions [which are spoken of in p. 53., in the notice of the haw- 
finch], where they were often seen during the last winter, and 
generally feeding on a variety of spruce fir bearing a small 
cone. I have invariably found the crossbill preferring the 
larch to every other tree of the pine tribe, except in this 
instance, when the seeds of the small cones of this variety of 
spruce fir appeared to be their favourite food. I have seen 
them feeding on the common spruce fir, and occasionally on 
the Scotch and Weymouth pines, but seldom on the two last 
mentioned. 

Rusticus (of Godalming), in his esteemed communication 
(VI. Ill-— 116.) of " More about Birds," in speaking of the 
habits of the crossbill, says (VI. 113.), that the idea of its 
" holding the fir cone in the claw, and extracting the seeds 
with the beak, must have been suggested by some wag to a 
credulous naturalist." Now, I do not in the least doubt 
but Rusticus is perfectly correct, as far as he may have had 
opportunities of observing the habits of this species, and, as 
he mentions the acts of individuals which he observed feeding 
on the Scotch pine, he may not have closely watched the 
movements of this species when on the larch. 

From October, 1821, to the middle of May in 1822, cross- 
bills were very numerous in this county, and, I believe, ex- 
tended their flights into many parts of England. Large 
flocks frequented some plantations of fir trees in this vicinity 
from the beginning of November to the following April. I 
had almost daily opportunities of watching their movements ; 
and so remarkably tame were they, that, when feeding on fir 
trees not more than fifteen or twenty feet high, I have often 
stood in the midst of the flock, unnoticed and unsuspected. 
I have seen them, hundreds of times, when on the larch, cut 
the cone from the branch with their beak, and, holding it 
firmly in both claws, as a hawk would a bird, extract the 
seeds with the most surprising dexterity and quickness. I do 
not mean to assert this to be their general habit ; but it was 
very frequently done when feeding on the larch. I have never 
seen them attempt the like method with cones of the Scotch or 
other species of pine, which would be too bulky for them to 
manage. Their method with these, and, of course, most 
frequently with the larch, was to hold firmly on the cone 
with their claws ; and, while they were busily engaged in this 



Birds, 55 

manner, I have captured great numbers ; many with a horse- 
hair noose, fixed on the end of a fishing-rod, which I managed 
to slip over the head when they were feeding, and, by drawing 
it quickly towards the body, I easily secured them ; others I 
took with a limed twig, fixed in such a manner in the end of 
the rod that on touching the bird it became immediately dis- 
engaged from it, adhered ro the feathers, rendered the wings 
useless, and caused the poor bird to fall perfectly helpless on 
the ground. In this manner, in windy weather, I have taken 
several from the same tree, without causing any suspicion of 
danger. On warm sunny days, after feeding a considerable 
time, they would suddenly take wing, and, after flying round 
for a short time in full chorus, alight on some lofty tree in 
the neighbourhood of the plantations, warbling to each other 
in low pleasing strains ; they would also fly from the trees 
occasionally for the purpose of drinking, their food being of 
so dry a nature. 

In captivity they were quickly reconciled, and soon became 
very familiar. As, at first, I was not aware what food would 
suit them, I fixed branches of the larch against the sides of 
the room in which I had confined them, and threw a quantity 
of the cones on the floor. I found that they not only closely 
searched the cones on the branches, but, in a few days, not 
one was left in the room that had not been pried into. I gave 
them canary and hemp seed ; but, thinking the cones were 
both amusement and employment, I continued to furnish them 
with a plentiful supply. I had about four dozen of them ; 
and frequently, whilst I have been in the room, they would 
fly down, seize a cone with their beak, carry it to a perch, 
quickly transfer it to their claws, and, in a very short time, 
empty it of its seeds, as I have very many times witnessed, to 
my surprise and amusement. As the spring advanced, the 
male birds in the plantations were frequently singing on the 
tops of the firs, in low but very agreeable notes ; yet they 
continued in flocks, and were seen in some parts of the county 
until the beginning of June. I had hopes of their breeding 
in confinement, and I accordingly kept them in different rooms, 
fixing the tops of young fir trees in the floor, and against the 
walls, and supplying them with as great a variety of food as 
possible ; but all to no purpose, as neither those I had con- 
fined in this manner, nor those in cages, ever showed any 
inclination to breed. They are amusing birds in confinement, 
as they have some of the habits of the parrot tribe; climbing 
about the cage with both beak and claws. 

Since 1822 I have seen but few crossbills: small flocks 
have occasionally visited the fir plantations in the neighbour- 
hood, but have remained only a short time. During the early

pnrt of last winter, a small flock took up their abode in some 
plantations near Ipswich ; and, in the beginning of September 
of the present year, several specimens were seen, and one 
killed evidently in nestling plumage much resembling in mark- 
ings the young greenfinch. 

When every part of our islands shall have been visited by 
naturalists with ears alive to every note, and eyes that mark 
the species by the passing glance, at rest or in the distant 
flight, then may we expect to hear of different localities, where 
the crossbill may occasionally breed ; which may probably be 
in some of our mountainous districts ; more especially as the 
sides of the hills, in many parts of the empire, are now 
covered w^ith rising woods of larch and other species of the 
pine tribe. — J. D. Hoy. November 9.S. and Dec. 4. J 833. 

Notices of the occurrence of the crossbill will be found in 
I. 391-, 395.; 11.89.268.; III. 176.; IV. 163. 449.; \.555.; 
VI. 112. In some of these places, facts are added on the 
food and manners of this species. From these, and the pre- 
sent one by Mr. Hoy, it seems that, although the crossbill may 
prefer the seeds of the common larch for its food, it will, in 
the absence of these, partake of the seeds of any species of 
pine, fir, or larch ; and, it is highly probable, of the seeds 
of any plant included in the natural order ^bietinae. Mr. 
Yarrell has, in the Zoological Jonrnal, iv. 459. to 465., de- 
scribed, and illustrated by seven coloured figures, the struc- 
ture of the crossbill's beak, and the form, office, and relative 
action of each of the bones and muscles which subserve the 
bird's act of extracting and taking its food. Mr. Yarrell has 
quoted Mr. Townson for some facts on habits. From both 
authors we have learned as follows: — The structure of the 
beak in the two British species of crossbill, and in these alone 
of all British birds, is such as supplies a capability of lateral 
motion, and of a surprising degree of power in a lateral direc- 
tion. These avail the bird in the acquisition of food, thus. 
It first fixes itself across the cone, and then brings the points 
of its mandibles from their crossed or lateral position, so that 
they are immediately over each other. The bird then in- 
sinuates its beak, thus reduced in compass, between the 
scales of the cone, and then opening its mandibles, not in the 
manner of birds of other species, but by drawing the lower 
mandible sidewise, it forces the scales asunder. It now 
applies its tongue, which has at the extremity a peculiar ap- 
pendage resembling a cutting scoop; this is inserted under- 
neath the seed, which, by it, is dislodged and conveyed to the 
mouth. — J, D.

John Harrop, son of the sub-curator of the Manchester 
Museum of Natural History, was, on Oct. 18. 1833, passmg 
through the Manchester fish and game market, he was struck 
with the appearance of a bird among a number of larks. He 
obtained it, and it turns out to be Plectrophanes lapponica. 
Mr. Harrop, on dissecting it, could not determine whether it 
was a female or a young male ; he thought it the latter. On 
comparing it with the figure in 'Fauna Boreali- Americana, 
I should say that the figure is highly coloured; while the 
colours of the specimen are more brilliant than those in Wil- 
son's figure. The specimen is now in the Museum of the 
Manchester Natural History Society. The bird was taken 
near Preston, in this county. 

While writing, I would ask T. K. (VI. 519.) to examine 
the works of Messrs. Harrop. — J. O. Manchester,) Nov. 1 1. 

Crossing and Lengthening in the Mandibles of Birds ,• Re- 
marks on the Causes qf\ and Conditions observable in, (III. 402. ; 
VI. 517.) — In the numerous instances which have fallen 
under my observation, it has always appeared to me that 
excess of nutriment has been the principal, if not the sole, 
cause ; as in every case the individuals have been in good 
plump condition. Monstrosities of this kind, consequently, are 
much more common among birds in captivity than birds in a 
state of nature : and it may be generally observed, particu- 
larly in soft-billed birds, that the under mandible is more 
subject to grow out than the upper. I have repeatedly 
noticed this in the redstart and robin, and have now, in 
confinement a pied water-wagtail, in which I find it necessary 
to cut off, every three or four weeks, nearly a quarter of an 
inch of horny substance at the extremity of the under man- 
dible. In a twite (Linaria montana), also, which I possess, 
the lower mandible grows out still more rapidly than in the 
wagtail, and has continued to do so for upwards of a twelve- 
month ; though the upper one has ever retained its natural 
form. In the bullfinch and in the oxeye I have known the 
upper mandible to increase, and not the under ; but these are 
the only instances. The goldfinch and the siskin are very 
apt to have both mandibles grow out ; one of the former, in 
my possession, has, at this time, its bill nearly half as long 
again as it ought to be, but the mandibles do not cross. An old 
favourite siskin, which I long kept in confinement, was a per- 
fect Loxia in this respect, and its mandibles became, in time, 
so much decussated, as seriously to inconvenience the bird. 
While removing the excrescence, I chanced, unfortunately, to 
pass the knife rather too deep ; and, though the wound was so 
small as to be scarcely visible, the poor little creature bled to 
death. I mention this as a caution to others who may find it 



58 Short Communications : — 

necessary to use the knife in similar cases. When once the 
bill of a bird has begun to grow out in this manner, it will 
always continue to do so ; and, though cut, will very soon 
.increase again ; in the instance of the goldfinch above- 
mentioned, the lower mandible continued to grow out for six 
or eight months before the upper one commenced, but both 
now increase equally fast. This elongation of the mandibles 
has never taken place in any of the numerous species of 
warblers (Sylvianae) which I have kept, and now keep, in cap- 
tivity ; though the birds of the robin kind appear extremely 
subject to it. Among other species, I have noticed it in 
the tree sparrow (Passer arboreus, Pringilla montana L.) — 
Edwat^d Blytlu Tooting^ Surrey^ Nov. 26. 1833. 

The crossing of the mandibles in the crossbill itself seems 
liable to a variation in the mode. Mr. Yarrell, in his Treatise 
on the beak of the crossbill. Zoological Journal, iv. 459., has 
this remark : — "In some individuals the upper mandible is 
turned to the right, the lower mandible curved to the left ; in 
others, the position of the mandibles is reversed as to their 
direction." 

In continued frosts, one occasionally sees a robin, or other 
species of bird, with the distal half, more or less, of one, 
usually the upper, of its mandibles absent; broken off, perhaps 
by a shot, perhaps by the bird's violent application of it to the 
ground, then frozen " hard as a stone," to remove thence some 
object of food. As the portion which is left of the fractured 
mandible usually exhibits some bloodiness, the bird, the fate 
of Mr. Blyth's siskin suggests, bleeds to death. If not, it 
may be presumed that it must die of starvation, from its 
inability, from the absence of the more prehensive part of 
one mandible, to pick up a sufficiency of food for sustaining 
itself.— J. Z). 

Excrescences on the Head and other Parts of the Common 
Hedge Chanter {Acc^?itor moduldris Cuv.) (VI. 153.) — In the 
instances which have come under my notice, I am confident 
they were of extremely rapid formation. A short time since, 
one of these birds was brought to me, weak and exhausted for 
want of food ; really a hideous object, with numerous large 
excrescences on different parts, some of which completely 
blocked up the nostrils, and twisted the beak out of all form, 
completely incapacitating it from taking any kind of food, but 
which was nevertheless extremely plump and in good condi- 
tion. I once observed excrescences somewhat similar rise in 
the course of four days on the head and knee (the real heel) 
of a tree pipit [A'nthus arboreus), one of which was very nearly 
as large as the head itself. — Edward Blyth, Tooting, Surrey,

Entomological Society of London, 59 

Entomology. — The E?itomological Society of London held 
the first meeting, of their first session, in the evening of Nov. 4. 
1833, at 17. Old Bond Street. Messrs. Kirby and Spence, 
the distinguished authors of the Introduction to Entomology^ 
and thereby the founders, it may be said, of this science 
in Britain, were present, and the members assembled, about 
fifty in number (including Messrs. Stephens, Hope, Walker, 
Westwood, Yarrell, Dr. Horsfield, and Col. Sykes), testified 
their sincere gratification at this circumstance. The Rev. Mr. 
Kirby, who had been unanimously chosen honorary pre- 
sident of the Society, and to whom the chair, first taken by 
J. G. Children, Esq., was resigned, stated that he would do 
all in his power to advance the interests of the Society ; but 
that he felt that, at seventy-four years of age, much would 
not be expected from him. He could not, however, refrain 
from observing, that science was indebted for the most interest- 
ing and valuable portions of the work to which his own name 
appeared conjointly as author, to his friend beside him ; and, 
here, Mr. Kirby laid his hand on the shoulder of Mr. Spence. 

The meeting elected Mr. Spence an honorary member, by 
general acclamation ; and Mr. Spence, in returning thanks, 
avowed that he came to the meeting, and had brought his 
two sons, for the express purpose of joining the Society. He 
then produced a letter, which was read by one of his sons, 
detailing so much of the proceedings at the late meeting of 
naturalists at Breslaw as referred to entomology, and with 
which, he said, he had been favoured, previously to leaving 
Paris, a fortnight ago, by M. Lefebvre, the secretary of the 
Societe Entomologique de France, who, as well as many 
others of the principal members, had expressed to him their 
high gratification at the institution of the Entomological So- 
ciety of London, and their ardent desire that a frequent inter- 
course between the two Societies might promote the objects 
which both have in view. 

Mr. W. B. Spence (eldest son of Mr. Spence) was then 
elected foreign secretary of the Society, and the members, 
after going through the by-laws and other routine business, 
separated, highly gratified at the very auspicious circumstances 
under which the meetings of the new Society had been com- 
menced. 

The second meeting took jilace on Dec. 2. " The room 
was considerably crowded." Some scientific communications 
were read. For the details, see the Entomological Magazine 
for January, 1834-. The Society's future meetings are to be 
held on the first Monday in every month, and the chair to be 
taken precisely at 8 o'clock in the evening.

During last year, 1832, I met with only one example; but, 
during the previous year, I must have noticed a hundred at 
least. They are fixed in precisely the attitude of life, as if 
only resting for a short time ; and, from this appearance, may 
have escaped general observation. 

While standing (in 1832) under an oak tree at Hamp- 
stead, something fell down from the boughs upon the grass, 
in which it produced a loud humming noise. I searched 
for it, and found it to be a common bluebottle fly, spinning 
round upon the earth, and uttering that peculiar buzz which 
it makes when struggling with a spider ; and firmly attached 
to it was a dung-fly, which was rather reluctant to loose its 
hold : before, however, I could open a pill-box to receive 
them, they had separated, and flown off in different directions.

MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE. 



Art. I. Retrospective Criticism, 

Observations on Classijicatio?^ hi reference to the Essays of 
Messrs. Jenyns (VI. 385.), Newman (481.), andBlytli (485.). 
— Sir, The two great defects of modern systems appear to be, 
the want of simplicity and of uniformity ; and I cannot but 
think that both these may be in great measure attained, with- 
out any violence being offered to the " natural system." 

Mr. Jenyns (VI. 385 — 390.) appears to have blended 
together two distinct causes of complaint : first, that in 
modern systems genera are founded upon characters of un- 
equal value (^. ^. Emberiza and Plectrophanes) ; and, se- 
condly, that several genera are placed in the same family, 
certain of which are more nearly allied to each other than 
they are to the remaining ones (f. g. Tetrao, Zagopus, Per- 
dix, Coturnix). In making the first complaint, Mr. Jenyns 
seems to have overlooked the fact, that, when a systematist 
separates a new genus from an old one, he must necessarily 
restrict the characters of the old genus, as well as establish 
those of the new; or else the species in question might be 
referred as correctly to one genus as the other. Linnaeus 
founded the genus Emberiza on a peculiar form of the bill. 
He is silent concerning the other characters of the bird. 
Now, if we define the genus Plectrophanes to possess that 
peculiar bill and a long hind-claw, it is plain that we must add 
to our definition of Emberiza the character of having a short 
hind-claw. When this is done, the two genera become of 
equal value, be the number of species in each what it may, 
since they are founded on characters of equal importance, and 
they are therefore no longer liable to Mr. Jenyns's objection. 
Whether the characters of these groups are of sufficient value 
to constitute genera, is another question ; and I fully agree 
with Mr. Jenyns in deprecating the practice of multiplying 
genera ad infinitum upon the most trivial and unimportant 
characters. 

Let us now turn to Mr. Jenyns's second cause of complaint. 
The genera Tetrao and Perdix, if restricted as shown above, 
may be rendered of the same value as their offsets Zagopus 
and Coturnix ; but still Zagopus will be more nearly related 



Retrospective Criticism. 63 

to Ti^trao than to Perdix. If we place these genera, as Mr. 
Newman (p. 484.) proposes, in two distmct families of Rasores, 
viz., Zetraonidae and Perdicidae, still these two will be more 
nearly connected witli each other than they are with Phasia- 
nidae, or any other collateral family. Or if we follow Mr. 
Blyth (p. 487.)> in making them into subfamilies, Jetraona? 
and Perdicianae, of the family Petraonidae, we shall diminish 
the simplicity of our system by multiplying our groups, and 
its uniformity by introducing a new kind of group, the sub- 
family, which it will be impossible to apply to every branch 
of the animal kingdom. We ought, I think, to adopt no 
more gradations of groups in any one class than admit of 
being established in every class. It therefore only remains to 
make these minor groups into subgenera or sections of the 
larger ones, Tetrao and Perdix. Subgenera are practically 
useful for facility of reference ; and they are useful to the more 
philosophic naturalist, by bringing into one view those species 
which are nearest allied ; thus giving a right direction to his 
comparisons and observations: but it is, I think, of the 
utmost importance that these subgenera should not have 
names imposed upon them. The needless multiplication of 
names is the very bane of science; loading the memory be- 
yond its powers of endurance, and degrading the philosophic 
naturalist into a walking dictionary. Careful and minute 
observations on animals cannot be carried too far ; they enrich 
the descriptions of species, and supply characters for sub- 
genera; and hence Mr. Blyth deserves much praise for his 
careful remarks upon the habits of birds, in Rennie's Field 
Natiiralisfs Magazine ; but I cannot agree with him, that be- 
cause distinct, and even natural, groups can be formed upon 
these minor characters, therefore every such group is to be 
made a genus, and honoured with a name. Suppose that, 
instead of studying one order of birds alone, Mr. Blyth was 
to extend the same principle to the whole animal kingdom, we 
should have, perhaps, 50,000 or 60,000 genera ! Who, then, 
could be an ornithologist, much less a zoologist? Language 
itself would fail in finding names for such a countless multi- 
tude. 

Another strong objection to naming subgenera is, that the 
generic and subgeneric name are continually confounded and 
used promiscuously. This is often the case with the French 
writers; and even the immortal Begne Animal o^ C\\\\qv \s 
not free from this blemish. The confusion which hence arises 
is evident. Mr. Jenyns's plan seems, therefore, to be the 
best; to distinguish subgenera, or, as I would rather call 
them, sections, by signs or letters. But now comes Mr. New- 



64 Retrospective Criticism, 

man*s difficulty ; how are we, in writing or conversation, to 
indicate subgenera? I think that, for common purposes, it 
is not necessary to do so at all. When the name of a genus 
is mentioned, a knowledge of the larger groups in which it is 
contained is presupposed. If, therefore, we carry the standard 
of our genera too low, it is probable that none but those few 
who have leisure to make themselves perfect in zoology will 
know the class or order of a genus which another person may 
casually mention. If a naturalist at Calcutta is told that the 
jPringiUa coe^lebs is common in England, he at once recognises 
the general characters of the bird ; but if it were called Schiza 
cce'lebs, as Mr. Blyth would call it, it is a great chance 
whether he would be the wiser for the information. But, if 
greater accuracy be required, the informant may add that it 
belongs to section A or B ; and, if he were describing a new 
species, he would, of course, either indicate the section, or 
describe it with sufficient accuracy to enable any one to refer 
it to the right one. 

In offering these remarks, I am far from desiring the Lin- 
naean genera to be retained unaltered, but merely wish the 
practice of forming new genera not to be carried too far. 

Mr. Newman says (p. 480.) that the orders i^erae, ^ccl- 
pitres, and Coleoptera are not of the same value, because 
the latter contains many groups analogous to the two for- 
mer, and others quite different. He seems to have over- 
looked the remark of Decandolle, in Mr. Jenyns's paper 
(p. 389. note *), " that the same characters are not of equal 
value in different groups." Hence there can be no doubt 
that it is far more natural to found the orders of insects 
upon the structure of their wings, than to put Fespa, Libel- 
lula, and Cicindela into one order, on the ground of being 
rapacious; and ^'pis, Papilio, and Chrysomela into another, 
because they are herbivorous. 

Mr. Newman objects to uniting the Cetacea with the other 
Mammalia ; but if we attend not only to the number of charac- 
ters which they have in common, but to the value of those 
characters, that is, to the high station which they hold in the 
scale of existence, there can be little doubt that this is a 
natural union. The claim of the Marsupialia, and especially 
the Scansores, is more doubtful; founded, as they are, on 
single characters only, and those not, perhaps, of very great 
importance. I am. Sir, yours, &c. — H. E, Strickland. 

Classijication (VI. 385. 481— 488.)— Mr. Newman (p.480.) 
appears to me to have misunderstood the observations of 
Mr. Jenyns. (p. 385.) Mr. Jenyns refers, I presume, to a plan 
similar to that adopted in botany; where subgenera (or, as they 



Retrospective Criticism, 65 

are there called, sections) are very generally used and named : 
the sectional names being merely intended for convenience in 
description and reference, and not to be retained in the 
memory. The sections are founded upon characters which 
are considered of subordinate value to those used in distin- 
guishing the genera : the latter depending almost solely on 
the construction of the flower and fruit, and the former upon 
the general habit of the plant, the form and character of the 
leaves, stipules, &c., and such variations in the fructification 
as are found to be but of little value in the natural order 
to which the plant belongs. The advantage of this plan 
appears to be, that the genera in each order, all depending 
upon modifications of the same parts, are of nearly an equal 
value, and the sections are only employed where there is a 
marked difference in subordinate characters or habit between 
the parts of a genus. Some genera will therefore contain 
many of these sections, and others only one; in the same 
manner that an order is sometimes found to contain only one 
genus. Or, perhaps, it would be more correct to say, that we 
are not yet acquainted with the other sections of the genus or 
the other genera of the order. In illustration of this, I give 
the characters of the genera and sections (subgenera) in the 
tribe Thlaspidese, order Cruciferae. 

The tribe is divided into two parts : — 1. Cells of silicle 
two- or many-seeded; 2. Cells of silicle one-seeded. 

I take the former of these, because it contains three British 
genera : the characters are — 

TTilaspi. — Silicle emarginate at the apex, valves winged at the back ; cells 
two- or many-seeded. 

Hutchins/flf. — Silicle elliptical, valves wingless ; cells two-, rarely three-, 
seeded. 

Teesdah'a. — Silicle oval, emarginate at the apex ; cells two-seeded; sta- 
mens each with a scale on the inner side at the base. 

Platyspermum. — Silicle oblong, crowned by the short thick style; cells 
four-five-seeded ; seeds with a broad margin. 

The genus Thlapsi is divided into the following sections 
(subgenera) : — 

Seel. Pachyphragma. — Silicle broad. Style none. Dissepiment thick, 
double, furnished with three longitudinal plates. Seeds tour, not 
striated. 

Sec. 2. Carp6ceras. — Valves expanding at the end into a hornlike wing. 
Dissepiment membranous, oblong. Seeds four, striated. 

Sec. 3. Nomisma. — Valves with a wing along the whole back. Seeds 
numerous, striated. 

Sec. 4. Is'eurotropis. — Silicle orbicular, with a narrow recess : back of 
Vol. VII. — No. 37. f 



66 Retrospective Criticism* 

the valves with a broad wing, circumscribed by a nerve. Seeds 
numerous, not striated. 

Sec. 5. Pterotropis. — Silicle somewhat obovate, with a broad recess, or 
truncate ; back of the valves with a wing not circumscribed by a nerve. 
Seeds not striated. 

Hutchins/a is divided into 

Sec. 1. /beridella. — Style filiform. Leaves entire or toothed. Flowers 
purplish, resembling those of an /b^ris. 

Sec. 2. A^asturtiolum. — Leaves pinnate, lobed. Flowers small, white, 
like those of Draba and Teesdah'a. 

Teesdah'a and Platyspermum have no sections, or, rather, 
each contains only one. 

According to the plan proposed by Mr. Newman, the above 
sections must, I presume, be formed into genera, and the 
genera themselves vv^ill become families ; therefore the two 
(TeesdahVz and Platyspermum), which have only one section, 
must have new names invented, to mark the difference between 
the family and the genus. I cannot see what additional 
advantage would result from this plan, to compensate for load- 
ing the memory with additional terms. 

In speaking of a plant, the generic and specific names alone 
are used ; the sectional one being only employed in descrip- 
tion, to avoid repeating the same character in numerous spe- 
cies, or to communicate a general idea of a plant without 
giving a detailed description. This plan, of named genera 
and sections, has been partially adopted in entomology. See 
the genus Colymbetes, in which the generic character depends 
chiefly on the formation of the mouth, and the sectional upon 
that of the legs. — Charles C Bahington, M.A., F.L.S., &c. 

Mr. Audubon and his Work, the Biography of Birds, (VI. 
550.) — One glance more at testimonies relative to Mr. Au- 
dubon's claim to the authorship of the Biography of Birds. 

" I have read Mr. Audubon's original manuscripts, and I 
have read Mr. Waterton's original manuscripts ; and both 
before they were published.* I think the English of the one 
is as good as the English of the other." {W, Swainso?i, 
in VI. 550.) 

" Mr. Audubon is the son of French parents. He was 
educated in France till the age of seventeen. At that time he 
could not speak the English language. It cannot, therefore, 
be the least disparagement to Mr. Audubon, if, when he had a 
valuable work to publish in English, he should wish to receive

371.) 

" Tanta est discordia fratrum ! " Ovid. 

What proof of discord here we see 
'Twixt Mr. Swainson and R. B. ! 

Here I beg to remark, that Audubon told Cuvier that he 
had resided for twenty years in the woods of America, living 
in a rude hut, constructed by himself, for the purpose of 
studying the habits of birds. Now, let us put these twenty 
years to seventeen, and we get thirty-seven. Then let us take 
into consideration the time which Mr. Audubon must have 
spent in his "counting-room" in Louisville, and in buying 
and selling goods in other places : for be it known that he 
kept a shop for many years in the United States. This is far 
from being a discreditable circumstance; I merely introduce 
it to show that his avocations of a commercial nature might 
possibly have interfered with those of a literary nature. The 
contradictory, ungrammatical, ill-constructed paper, signed 
" Audubon," on the habits of the turkey buzzard, which 
appeared in Jamewn!s Journal for 1826 [reviewed in VI. 
162 — 171.]; in which paper, by the way, Mr. Swainson 
found a " freshness and an originality," which he pronounced 
to be " delightful to the general reader," [I. 45.] seems to bear 
me out in my surmise. Enough. " How blind is that man," 
said Don Quixote, "who cannot see through a sieve!" — 
Charles IVaterton, Walto7i Hall, Nov. 7. 1833. 

Mr, AiiduboUi Jtm. (VI. 550.) — How extremely forgetful 
it was in this gentleman, when he attempted (VI. 551.) a 
defence of his father's account of the rattlesnake, never 
once to have alluded, in the slightest manner, to the mo- 
mentous descent of the large American squirrel, tail fore- 
most, down the rattlesnake's throat ! To have touched upon 
the minor parts of that very startling narrative, and not to 
have bestowed a solitary word on the tail-foremost feature of 
it, is as defective in Mr. Audubon, jun., as it would be in a 
surgeon who should try to dissect the fibrous roots only of a 
cancer, and leave the cancer itself to eat into the vitals of his 
unfortunate patient. Nobody doubts that rattlesnakes swallow 
squirrels ; but every body must condemn Audubon's account 
of a rattlesnake chasing a squirrel, and then swallowing it tail 
foremost. Tail foremost ! Why, as long as this foul stain on 
the page of Audubon's zoology remains unblotted out, of what 
use is it in his son to tell me that his father has ex})l()red the 
" Floridas, the Keys, and the Tortugas Islands?" The story 
of the rattlesnake will always appear against him, as a phan-

68 Retrospective Criticism. 

torn of bad omen, and it will warn me how I put confidence 
in other narratives which may come from Mr. Audubon's 
zoological pen. Indeed, if even his friends should be rash 
enough to call me to account for incredulity on future topics, 
my short and simple answer will be, that Mr. Audubon's story 
of a rattlesnake swallowing a large American squirrel, tail 
foremost, still sticks in my throat, and that positively I cannot 
try to gulp any thing else till they manage to ease me of that 
foreign body. 

In the very face of this reptile stinging his father's reputa- 
tion, Mr. Audubon, jun., has the temerity to hint at fables in 
the Wanderings. Will he have the goodness to point them 
out? Should he succeed in proving a fable in one single 
instance, be it ever so trivial, I will renounce all claim to 
veracity, and never more write another word to meet the 
public eye. 

Mr. Audubon, jun., remarks, that what little information I 
have given of the American birds is positively useless until 
I publish an Indian vocabulary. In the same breath he 
adds, that Azara has given us both the Indian and scientific 
names of the birds. To crow^n all, he pronounces Azara " the 
very first authority on these matters;" after telling us that 
Azara affects to despise system. Again, he appears shocked 
at my want of science, just, by the by, after he has most 
unhappily quoted his father's own words, to prove to us that 
his father himself stood in absolute need of a scientific assist- 
ant ; while his friend Swainson fully confirms this arrant 
ignorance in the great American ornithologist, by telling the 
world that he was expected to have given assistance to Audu- 
bon in the scientific details of his work. 

Systematic arrangement, in moderation, is useful and desir- 
able ; still it would not suit the Wanderings, a work which 
professes to be nothing but a sketch. Were I to sit down 
expressly to describe the habits of those birds of which I have 
a knowledge, I should begin by saying, Preserve me from 
bewildering Mr. Loudon's readers in the mazes of modern 
divisions and subdivisions of birds, and hard names, and 
mathematical sections of bill and toe ; till, at last, we hardly 
dare pronounce a crow not to be a magpie ! These arcana of 
foot and front are, and ought to be, the exclusive property of 
those " eminent and scientific naturalists of the metropolis," 
who inspect bird-skins in closets. Young Mr. Audubon has 
applied, in his hour of need, to these grave doctors in nomen- 
clature for their opinion on me. Eheu ! I am condemned. 
Well, it is some consolation, at least, to have one's death- 
warrant pronounced by the first judges of the land inforo

I will now proceed to give Mr. Audubon, jun., proof sufficient 
that I can detect a fable from genuine ornithology, without 
having recourse to the pages of Azara, in order to learn my 
lesson. Ere I commence, however, I must just hint to 
Mr. Audubon, jun., that he has not succeeded in convincing 
me of his father's " fair fame." I myself, with mine own 
eyes, have seen Wilson's original diary, written by him at 
Louisville ; and 1 have just now on the table before me the 
account of the Academy of Sciences indignantly rejecting 
Mr. Audubon as a member, on that diary having been pro- 
duced to their view. — Charles Watertoii, 

Aerial Encounter of the Eagle and the Vulture. (See Audu- 
bon's Biography of Birds^ p. 163.) — Next to the adventure 
of the rattlesnake and squirrel, I am of opinion that this pre^ 
sents the toughest morsel ever offered to the proverbially wide 
gullet of Mr. Bull. Audubon says ; — " Many vultures were 
engaged in devouring the body and entrails of a dead horse, 
when a white-headed eagle accidentally passing by, the vul- 
tures all took to wing, one, amongst the rest, with a portion of 
the entrails, partly swallowed, and the remaining part, about 
a yard in length, dangling in the air. The eagle instantly 
marked him, and gave chase. The poor vulture tried, in vain, 
to disgorge, when the eagle, coming up, seized the loose end 
of the gut, and dragged the bird along for twenty or thirty 
yards, much against its will, till both fell to the ground ; 
when the eagle struck the vulture, and in a few moments 
killed it, after which he swallowed the delicious morsel." In 
his strange paper on the habits of the turkey buzzard, Mr. 
Audubon tells us " that if the object discovered is large, 
lately dead, and covered with a skin too tough to be ate and 
torn asunder (cart before the horse), and afford free scope to 
their appetites, they remain about it and in the neighbour- 
hood." Now, reader, observe, that, the dead horse being a 
large animal, its skin, according to this quotation, must 
have been too tough to be torn asunder by the vultures, 
until putrefaction took place. If, then, these vultures really 
commenced devouring the dead animal while it was yet fresh, 
Mr. Audubon's theory, just quoted, is worth nothing. If, on 

F 3 



70 Retrospective Criticism. 

the contrary, the horse in question had become sufficiently 
putrid to allow the vultures to commence operations, then I 
will show that the aerial account of the eagle and the vulture 
is either a mere imaginary effusion of the author's fancy, or a 
hoax played off upon his ignorance by some designinor wag. 

The entrails of a dead animal are invariably the first part 
t(? be affected by putrefaction. Now, we are told, that a piece 
of gut had been torn from the rest, and swallowed by the vul- 
ture ; a portion of the said gut, about a yard in length, hang- 
ing out of his mouth. The vulture, pressed hai'd by the 
eagle, tried in vain to disgorge the gut. This is at variance 
with a former statement, in which Mr. Audubon assures us 
that an eagle will force a vulture to disgorge its food in a mo- 
ment: so that the validity of this former statement must be 
thrown overboard, in order to insure the safety of the present 
adventure; or, vice versa, the present adventure must inevi- 
tably sink, if the former statement is to be preserved. Be this 
as it may, the eagle, out of all manner of patience at the 
clumsiness of the vulture, in his attempt to restore to daylight 
that part of the gut which was lying at the bottom of his sto- 
mach, laid hold of the end which was still hanging out of the 
unfortunate rascal's mouth, and actually driigged him along 
through the air, for a space of twenty or thirty yards, much 
against the vulture's will. Now, though the eagle pulled, and 
the vulture resisted, still the yard of gut, which we must sup- 
pose was in a putrid state, for reasons already mentioned, re- 
mained fixed and firm in the vulture's bill. With such a force, 
applied to each extremity, the gut ought either to have given 
way in the middle, or to have been cut in two at those places 
where the sharp bills of the birds held it fast. But stop, 
reader, I pray you : speculation might be allowed here, pro- 
vided this uncommon encounter had taken place on terrajirmaj 
but, in order that our astonishment may be wound up to the 
highest pitch, we are positively informed that the contention 
took place, not on the ground, or in a tree, but in the circum- 
ambient air ! 

Pray, how was it possible for the eagle to progress through 
the air, and to have dragged along a resisting vulture, by 
means of a piece of gut acting as a rope, about a yard in 
length ? Birds cannot fly backwards ; and the very act of the 
eagle turning round to progress after it had seized the end of 
the gut, would have shortened the connecting medium so 
much, that the long wings of both birds must have imme- 
diately come in contact ; their progress would have been pre- 
vented by the collision ; and, in lieu of the eagle dragging the 
resisting vulture through the air, for a space of twenty or thirty 



Retrospective Criticism. 71 

yards, both birds would have come to the ground, or the gut 
would have given way. 

I have never read any thing in the annals of ornithology 
that bears any similarity to this aquila-vulturian exhibition 
progresshig through the vault of heaven. Verily, " there is 
a freshness in it." 

When we reflect that Mr. Audubon is an American ; that 
he has lived the best part of his life in America ; that the two 
birds themselves were American, and that their wonderful 
encounter took place in America, we Englishmen marvel 
much that Mr. Audubon did not allow the press of his own 
country to have the honour to impart to the world so astonish- 
ing an adventure. — Charles Waterton. Walton Hally Nov. 7. 
1833. 

Audubon's Humming-bird, (See his Biography of Birds, 
p. 248.) — Mr. Audubon tells us, that in one week the young 
of the ruby-throated humming-bird are ready to fly. One 
would suppose, by this, that they must be hatched with a good 
coating of feathers to begin with. Old Dame Nature some- 
times performs odd pranks. We are informed that our 
crooked-back Dicky the Third was born with teeth ; and Ovid 
mentions the astonishingly quick growth of certain men. He 
says, in his account of the adventures of Captain Cadmus, 
who built Thebes (my native town*), that the captain em- 
ployed some men as masons who had just sprung up out of 
the earth. 

I have read Mr. Audubon's account of the growth of the 
humming-bird, and I have read Mr. Ovid's account of the 
growth of Captain Cadmus's masons, and both very attentively. 
I think the veracity of the one is as apparent as the veracity 
of the other. What, in the name of skin and feathers, I ask, 
has Mr. Audubon found in the economy of the ruby-throated 
humming-bird to enable him to inform Englishmen that its 
young can fly in so short a space of time ? The young of no 
other bird that we are acquainted with, from the condor to 
the wren, can fly when only a week old. 

The humming-bird, in every part of its body and plumage, 
is quite as perfect as the eagle itself; neither is it known to 
differ in the duration of its life from any of the smaller birds 
of the forest which it inhabits. Like them, it bursts the shell 
in a state of nudity ; like them, it is blind for some days ; and, 
like them, it has to undergo the gradual process of fledging, 
which is so slow in its operation, that 1 affirm, without fear of

Audubon, jun., styles me the " learned Theban."

72 Beirospective Criticism. 

refutation, it cannot possibly produce, in the space of one 
short week, a series of feathers capable of supporting the bird 
through the air. 

Again, the precocious flying of the young birds argues 
precocity of feathers ; and this would authorise us to look for 
precocity of lustre in the male. But Mr. Audubon informs 
us that the male does not receive its full brilliancy of colour 
until the succeeding spring: and I myself can affirm, from 
actual observation, that the additional plumage which adorns 
some humming-birds does not make its appearance till towards 
the middle of the second year. 

Were it necessary, I could show to naturalists their error, 
in sometimes mistaking a male humming-bird of the first 
year for a full-plumaged female. I am fully satisfied in my own 
mind that the internal anatomy of all humming-birds is pre- 
cisely the same, except in size ; having found it the same in 
every humming-bird which I dissected in Guiana and Brazil. 
Now, as the young of the humming-birds in these countries 
require more than a week to enable them to fly, and as Mr. 
Audubon's humming-bird differs not in internal anatomy from 
them, I see no reason why the young of his species should 
receive earlier powers of flying than the young of the hum- 
ming-birds in the countries just mentioned. 

A word on the cradle. Mr. Audubon tells us that the 
little pieces of lichen, used in forming the nest of the humming- 
bird, *' are glued together with the saliva of the bird." Fiddle ! 
The saliva of all birds immediately mixes with water. A single 
shower of rain would undo all the saliva-glued work on the 
nest of Mr. Audubon's humming-bird. When our great 
master in ornithology (whose writings, according to Swainson 
[I. 45.], will be read when our favourite theories shall 
have sunk into oblivion) saw his humming-bird fix the lichen 
to the nest, pray what instrument did it make use of, in order 
to detach the lichen from the point of its own clammy bill 
and tongue ; to which it would be apt to adhere just as firmly 
as to the place where it was intended that it should perma- 
nently remain? — Charles Waterton, Walton Hall, Nov. 19.

" Like the turkeys, many of the weaker partridges often fall

by the act of swimming; neither would they be under the 
necessity of having recourse to " a protracted struggle " in a 
movement which requires no struggle at all. A bird struggling 
in the act of swimming, in order to save itself from drowning, 
is about the same as if we were to strufjgle in our usual act of 
walking, lest we perish therein. The very mention of " a 
protracted struggle " argues that the partridge cannot swim. 
A partridge on the water is nearly in as great a scrape as a 
shark on shore. The latter, by floundering, may, perchance, 
get into the water again ; still we cannot say that a shark 
moves surprisingly on land : and the former, by help of its 
feet, may possibly reach the river's bank, through an element 
as fatal to it as the shore is to the shark. All birds, whether 
alive or dead, must naturally float on the surface of the water ; 
but all birds cannot swim : otherwise those birds which we 
commonly call land birds would have to be new-modelled in 
form, and would require a very different kind of plumage. 

We startle at the novel information of a partridge " swim- 
ming surprisingly," and we are anxious to know what sudden 
change has taken place amongst the birds in the western 
hemisphere, whilst our eastern birds remain in statu quo. 
For example's sake, let us examine a waterhen, which, like 
the partridge, is not web-footed; still it swims remarkably 
well. Its body is nearly similar in shape to a boat ; the 
arrangement of its feathers is most admirably calculated to 
resist the entrance of the water; while its every motion, when 
in the act of swimming, is full of gracefulness and confidence. 
It moves to and fro by a very gentle action of the feet, and it 
may be seen, for hours together, enjoying itself on the deep in 
perfect security. This bird may be truly said to swim sur- 
prisingly ; but it is never doomed to keep up a protracted 
struggle by means of muscular power, in order to save its life, 
on an element where it runs no risk of perishing. 

Now let us look at a partridge floating on the river. The 
form of its body is very unlike that of the waterhen, and, 
though it cannot possibly sink, still it is in the utmost fear of 
death, and tries to reach the shore by an evident and vehement 
struggle. Its feathers immediately become saturated with 
water, whilst the cold strikes deeply into its body. Death is 
fast approaching; the wings are soaked with flapping on the 
water, and at last appear extended quite motionless on the 
surface of the stream ; the legs are cramped and stiffened ; 
the mouth is open ; the head falls, and, after a few convul- 
sive efforts to support itself, down it drops for the last time 
into the water, and the bird dies. This is the fate of the 
partridge which Mr. Audubon assures us can " swim sur- 



74 Retrospective Criticism, 

prisingly." The mere motion of its legs, to propel its floating 
body towards land, in order to escape from certain death on 
an element where it was never intended by Nature to exist, 
even for the space of one short hour, has been magnified by 
Mr. Audubon into an important act of " swimming sur- 
prisingly." 

If the admirers of Mr. Audubon should try to force us to 
agree with their great naturaUst, that partridges can " swim 
surprisingly," then it behoves us to call upon them to declare 
that every bird in the creation can swim. Our little tomtit, 
till now a land bird, must be proclaimed to swim surprisingly, 
and have a place amongst the waterfowl ; because, on tumbling 
accidentally into a washing-tub, he has " muscular power 
sufficient to keep up a protracted struggle" till he reaches the 
side. 

How delighted Ovid would have been, had he seen a par- 
tridge swimming surprisingly, or a goatsucker flying off" with 
a mouthful of eggs ! We are told in ancient history that the 
stomach of Mithridates was poison-proof: I wonder if his leg 
also was poison-proof; so that he could have danced, without 
danger of sudden death, in the fatal American boot mentioned 
by Mr. Audubon in his wonderful story of the rattlesnake's 
swallowing a squirrel tail foremost. — Charles Waterton, 

The Wandering Albatross [Diomedesi exulans L.) (V^I. 147.); 
its size (VI. 372, 373.) — I have a stuffed specimen, which was 
given me by your correspondent, " A Grenada Subscriber." 
Its dimensions are : — Length from the tip of the bill to the end 
of the tail, 4 ft. 2 in. ; expansion of wings about 1 1 ft. 4 in. ; the 
humerus measures 17 in. in length, the radius 18 J in., and the 
pinion, with its quills, 27iin. : the tail is very short, not 
exceeding 4 in. — A Subscriber, Vale of Alford^ Nov, 20. 1833. 

The Bird called '' Booby'' by Sailors (VI. 373.) is the Pele-

The Booby is not a Name, even amotig Sailors, for the Alba-

the application, by sailors, of the term " booby" " to any 
long-winged bird of a whitish colour," and to the albatross as 
one such. Although the ornithological terms of sailors are 
probably usually applied indefinitely enough, it appears, from 
Pennant's British Zoology, that the solan goose, or gannet, is 
the " booby." In a work called The Natural Historian the 
characters of the booby are given technically and in detail, 
but the scientific name is omitted. The albatross and the 
penguin have both obtained, among our sailors, the name of

Mr. Blijth's Identijication (VI. 516.) of the Species of Thrush 
'which W. L.i 'who describes (VI. 218.) its Migration, deems an 
unrecognised one, mth the Redwing {Turdtis Wiacus). — Sir, If 
W. L.'s species of thrush (VI. 218.), of which he saw "thou- 
sands" in the Island of Harris, in the month of June, prove 
to be not a new species, but merely the redwing (Turdus 
zliacus), as suggested by Mr. Blyth (VI. 516.), it will go near 
to establish the fiict (hitherto, so far as I am aware, not known 
to naturalists) of these birds remaining throughout the sum- 
mer, and breeding in the northern parts of Great Britain. It 
is much to be wished that W. L. had procured a specimen of 
his thrush, in order to put the point beyond dispute. Of the 
musical powers of the redwing I entertain no doubt ; for even 
in winter, when the weather is very fine, and still more in the 
spring, they will congregate on the top of a large tree, along 
with their friends the fieldfares, and begin to tune their pipes, 
uttering in concert a low, murmuring, half-stifled song, as 
it were an earnest of what they can do when in full voice. 
Many birds, as the chaffinch, blackcap, nightingale, &c., when 
first they commence their song in the spring, sing but imper- 
fectly, giving only detached fragments of their melody ; as if, 
from disuse, they had partly forgotten their notes, and were 
out of practice. Yours, &c. — W. T. Bree, Allesley Rectoiij,

No. 2. of The Field Naturalist's Magazine " as a correct eluci- 
dation of the species of the genus" Sylvia. My words in 
VI. 447,448. are, " Professor Rennie's admirable elucidation 
of the species Sylvia hippolais and rufa." 



76 Retrospective Criticism, 

Mr. Blyth asserts (VI. 521.) that " the common chiffchafF 
of this country, S. 15quax Herbert, S. hippolais of other British 
authors) is a distinct species from the S. rufa." I agree in the 
opinion that the S. loquax is identical with the S. hippolais of 
British authors ; but I do not stop here, as I consider the S. 
rufa identical with it also, from the fact that the song, habits, 
and manners of the chiffchafF, as long known to me, accord 
fully as well with the descriptions of S. rufa, as these are given 
by Continental authors, as they do with those of the "S. loquax 
of Herbert," or " the S. hippolais of other British authors : " 
in addition to which, the dimensions and plumage of the spe- 
cimen that I most particularly examined, and which was shot 
when in the act of uttering its singular song, coincided with 
those of the S. rufa as they are detailed by Temminck, Rennie, 
&c. — W, Thompson. Donegal Square, Belfast, iVoy. 28. 1833. 

The Red Viper. (VI. 399. 526.)— - Another specimen of 
this viper was brought me on Sept. 13. 1833 : its length 
was 9 J in. E. N. D. asserts (VI. 526.) that the red viper 
is the young of the common one ; but I cannot consider this 
as proved, till the vipers of internjediate size are captured 
and described. I have never been able to procure any but 
full-grown vipers, and young ones yet unborn : the latter are 
greyish, with dark markings, and show no signs of the pecu- 
liar colour of the red viper. Now, although colour alone is 
not sufficient to characterise the species of Ophidia, yet any 
marked difference of size would certainly form a specific dis- 
tinction. If, therefore, the red viper should prove never to 
exceed 10 in. in length, or if a series of young common 
vipers could be procured, of various sizes, but uniform in 
colour with the old ones, the distinctness of the red viper 
would be proved. I trust some of your readers may be able 
to decide this question. I am obliged to E. N. D. for his 
*' information " that the number of scuta in snakes is variable ; 
but if he will look at my communication, in p. 400., he will 
find that I have there stated the same thing. 

The Black Viper, mentioned by Mr. Blyth (VI. 527. )> 
differs from the common one only (I believe) in being of a 
darker colour; and is, therefore, deservedly considered a 
variety. — H. E. Strickland. Nov. 22. 1833. 

The Black Viper. (VI. 527.) — When E. N. D. says 
(VI. 526.) " there is but one species of viper or poi- 
sonous reptile in England, he forgets the black viper (Co- 
luber Prester of Linnaeus) ; to the existence of which, in the 
west of England, Mr. Blyth also alludes doubtfully, in VI. 
527. Of this species, I have seen, at different times, alive 
and at large, two specimens in the Isle of Wight, one of 



Retrospective Criticism, 77 

which I succeeded in killing on Oct. 12. 1804. I was, at the 
time, in company with a gentleman resident in the island, 
who seemed to be familiar with the reptile, and informed me 
that it was very venomous ; of which fact I entertain no 
doubt. " Os armatum est veneno diro," observes Linnaeus, 
in Fauna Suecica; he gives, as a synonyme, " Vipera anglica 
nigricans " of Petiver : the animal, therefore, has long been 
known as a native of England. On a transient view, this 
species appears entirely of a uniform deep black colour, as 
described by Linnaeus, " ater toto corpore; " but, on closer 
inspection, a row of angular spots, similar to that on the 
back of the common viper (C jBerus) is discernible, being of 
a still more intense black than the rest of the body. Li size, 
shape, manners, and habits it seems exactly to resemble the 
common species; of which, I think, I have heard that it has 
been sometimes considered only a variety, and from which I 
am not aware that it differs, except in colour. 

The red viper, mentioned in VL 399. 526., I should 
suspect, was only the young state of the common species ; the 
smaller specimens of which, I have observed, are generally of 
a brighter colour than the full-grown ones, and have the 
spots more inclining to red. — W, T. Bree. AllesJey Rectory^

Leptocephalus Morrisvi Pennant (V. 313. 742., VI. 531.) 
seems doomed to be never accurately represented by the 
engraver. The cut, in VL 531., which professes to be a 
copy of my drawing, is defective in one most essential point : 
the engraver has neglected to represent the pectoral fins, 
and has rendered the lateral line too strong. The engraving, 
with these exceptions, is very like the fish. — Hewy Vietz

The Authorship of the Prefixes, pro, meso, and meta, to the 
Limbs of Insects belongs to Mr. Newman ; not to Mr. Haliday. 
I observe that Mr. Westwood has appended to some techni- 
cal descriptions in VL 495, notef, a remark expressly for 
the purpose of depriving Mr. Newman of the merit of the 
above prefixes, and of giving the said merit to Mr. Haliday. 
Mr. Newman^rs/ pubhshed the names in question at p. 400. 
of the Entomological Magazine (July 1. 1833). Mr. Haliday 
has nowhere published them, that 1 can find. Luleed, at 
p. 516. of the same magazine, published three months subse- 
quently (Oct. 1. 1833.), he follows Meigen, in applying the 
term metatarsus to the last articulation of the tarsus ; so that 
it is evident that Mr. Haliday not only did not originate these 
terms, but declines employing them. — Lacon. Newcastle,

The additional British Species of Cicindela, alluded to,

p. 532., and that he is borne out by the testimony of the

Encrinite versus Cyathocrinite (VI. 560., and the pre- 
vious Discussions there indicated). — A few additional words 
appear necessary to set myself right with Mr. Gilbertson. I 
cannot exactly comprehend Mr. Gilbertson's description, at 
p. 561. He says, " the line of dots from a terminates at the 
alimentary canal ; that from 6, upon one of the five plates sur- 
rounding it, which form the pelvis ; c is placed upon the 
costals," &c. Now, according to this description, I find (as 
I am able to understand it) that the pelvis, in this specimen, 
formed a circle of less circumference than the vertebral 
column, and, consequently, was entirely hid by it. Is this 
fact, or is it error ? Is this ever known to be the case in any 
crinoideal animal? It is not the case in any of those figured 
or described by Miller, nor in any instance that has come 
under my own immediate observation. Mr. Gilbertson pro- 
ceeds to say, that, in my figure, " the whole of the pelvis, and 
nearly the whole of the costals, are hid by the column." 
This, I presume, is erroneous : if the enlargement of the 
column, in my specimen, is natural, and not formed of extra- 
neous matter, I think the above statement of Mr. Gilbertson 
would not be in accordance with the facts in our possession 
upon the subject. Does it not always follow, as a matter of 
course, that, where the column is enlarged and expanded at 
its junction with the pelvis, the pelvis is also widened and 
enlarged in the same proportion ? as in the genus Apocrinites. 
This, I think, cannot be denied. The relative size of the 
bones, in my specimen, will, I think, prove that this opinion 
of Mr. Gilbertson is not tenable. The scapula (according to 



Retrospective Criticism, 79 

Mr. Gilbertson's idea), which he describes as being in its pro- 
per place, in my figure, on the left of the column, is nearly as 
large as that part of the column which I have supposed to be 
extraneous. This scapula must rest upon a costal, and this 
costal upon a pelvic bone, or rather upon two pelvic bones ; 
the costal upon which this scapula rests must be as large as 
the scapula itself; and the pelvic bones upon which the 
costal rests must be of equal dimensions : therefore, if the 
scapula be nearly equal in size to the column, the sca- 
pula, costal, and pelvis, united, must of necessity be much 
larger ; and yet Mr. Gilbertson says, that, in my specimen, 
the column hides nearly the whole of these bones : this is a 
physical impossibility, for the thing covered is of greater 
magnitude than that which is said to cover it. Again : that 
the angular bones, in my specimen (VJ. 126.), and to 
which I have referred in VI. 472., are really the bones 
of the pelvis, is, I think, absolutely proved by their position. 
The costals are placed upon the pelvis, I believe in every 
instance, in this way : one costal rests upon part of two pelvic 
bones, and covers the joints formed between them ; and thus 
locks them together, precisely in the same way as a bricklayer 
places one brick to cover portions of two others, in laying one 
course over another, in building a wall : and this is exactly 
the position they occupy in my figure. If this bone were the 
scapula, the angular bone (the costal of Mr. Gilbertson) must 
have had a joint in the angle, in a line with the joint between 
the supposed scapulae ; but in my figure there is no such 
division. If the column absolutely *' covers the whole of the 
pelvis, and nearly the whole of the costals," it appears to me 
difficult to account for the use of the pelvic or costal plates ; 
for by this means they would be united into one solid mass, 
and, therefore, their division into plates would appear to be 
almost useless. In conclusion, Mr. Gilbertson accuses me of 
constructing a no7idescript. Whether he means this in good 
part or not, I can hardly say. I have already acknowleclged 
that, in my opinion, it had not "hitherto been figured or 
described ; " and it was because I considered it a nondescript 
that I communicated it to this Magazine, and endeavoured to 
furnish a description of it. If nothing is to be made public 
but what is already described, then must science have aheadv 
reached its limits ; and the naturalist may sit down in listless- 
ness, and exclaim, " There is no new thing under the sun ! ** 
Mr. Gilbertson sums up his observations by stating, that it is 
a desire to check the progress of error that alone has induced 
him to controvert my statements ; I beg to inform him that 
there is no other motive influencing me. I am not at all 
anxious to prove that I am in possession of the lily encrinite 



80 Queries and Ans*wers, 

from a new locality, and to make my specimen a lily encrinite, 
whether or not; for this would be mere childishness. The fact 
is this : the remains of a crinoideal animal fell into my hands ; 
I fancied it to be more nearly allied to the genus Encrinhes 
than to any other; this opinion I have given; I have given 
my reasons for that opinion ; and I have defended it : whether 
that opinion be right or wrong, others must judge. That it is 
a nondescript is no fault of mine ; I have argued for its being 
such : and, if Mr. Gilbertson would, in some way, publish 
figures of his specimens, which "have a much greater claim'* 
to be considered as encrinites than my specimen, perhaps the 
other opinion which I have stated (VI. 474.), that the encrinites 
pass by a regular gradation of form into the cyathocrinites, 
would receive additional confirmation, if not full proof. Mr. 
Gilbertson says that both specimens are the same ; that is, 
that mine is Cyathocrinites tuberculatus. This is impossible : 
the name itself contradicts it. There is not a single tubercle 
upon my specimen : it is almost as smooth as the paper upon 
which I am writing. Mr. Gilbertson has not noticed the 
relative proportions of the bones which I have pointed out in 
the different specimens. I should be extremely glad to be 
put in possession of figures of the specimens mentioned by 
Mr. Gilbertson ; and 1 think he would be doing the world a 
service by publishing them. Let us be put in possession of 
as much knowledge as possible, in order to come to a clear 
understanding of these singular animal remains. — C. Conway,

" On the supposed Connection of Vicissitudes of the Sea- 
sons and prevalent Disorders mth Volcanic Emanations,'' S^c. 
(VI. 289 to 308.) — Although the author (the Rev. W. 
B. Clarke) of that interesting communication does not posi- 
tively maintain a closer connection between events which are 
apparently dissimilar than that of juxtaposition, I think he 
has established a high degree of probability that the connec-

he has adduced. I propose, at a future time, to offer a few 
observations on some of the facts stated by Mr. Clarke, my 
object in the present letter being merely to request farther 
information from that gentleman respecting the " symptoms 
of renewed action in the extinct craters of the Eifel ; " and, 
again, " symptoms of renewed action in the extinct craters of 
Auvergne." (VI. 301.) The date of the latter is given Dec. 9. 
1828; but no authorities for either event are stated. It would 



Queries attd Answers, 81 

greatly oblige me if your ingenious correspondent would state 
the circumstances which have been called renewed symptoms 
of action more fully, and also the authorities by which they 
are supported. It could surprise no one who has attentively 
examined the extinct volcanoes in central France to be in- 
formed that they had broken forth into renewed activity after 
a period of repose of many hundred, if not thousand, years. 
Vesuvius is known to have had periods of repose for many 
centuries ; and the lava of some of the volcanoes in Auvergne 
appears as fresh as if it had been very recently erupted : in- 
deed, it is very difficult to conceive how it could preserve such 
a fresh appearance after exposure to the atmosphere for ages. 
In my Travels in the Tarentaise, published in 1823, I stated 
that " there is nothing in the appearance of the volcanoes of 
Auvergne which can lead the observer to the conclusion that 
their eruptions will never be renewed : the springs of hot water 
in this district indicate that the source of subterranean heat 
beneath it is not extinct. The most abundant and best known 
of these springs are Mont d'Or and Vichy ; they have a tem- 
perature of from 120° to 125°; and there are many other 
springs of equal temperature. Should the volcanoes of Au- 
vergne resume their activity, such an event would not be at 
variance with our present knowledge of volcanic operations." 
(vol. ii. p. 379.) Many of the eruptions in Auvergne must 
have taken place in a recent geological epoch; for lava has 
flowed into the present valleys, and the heaps of fresh scoriae 
that are "spread loosely, near the mouths of the craters, and 
volcanic vents to which they can be traced, prove that the 
country has not been since subjected to diluvial currents, for 
these would have swept them away. They prove, also, another 
fact of some interest : many of the most recent eruptions appear 
to have taken place from volcanic openings, which were closed 
before craters could be formed round them ; for, had craters 
been formed, and afterwards destroyed by inundations, the 
same causes would have removed the lava and scoriae. In 
other instances, volcanic craters were formed by repeated 
eruptions, and remain nearly perfect to the present time. 

The occurrence of volcanic mountains, over a space of 
several thousand square miles in central France, should induce 
us to receive with caution the accounts of the increase of 
temperature in Artesian wells in France, at a rate of about 1° 
of Fahrenheit for every 45 ft. of depth ; for this increase may 
depend on local causes, which may not extend into other 
countries. It is greatly to be regretted that few experiments 
on the temperature of Artesian wells have been made in Eng- 
land. If any correspondent could furnish information on this

subject, he would supply what is much wanted at the present 
time. — Robert Bakewell. Hampstead, Dec. 7. 1833. 

Mr. Clarke has in preparation a sequel to the very ori- 
ginal and valuable communication which Mr. Bakewell has so 
justly commended. In that sequel, Mr. Bakewell's queries and 
suggestions will, we are certain, receive Mr. Clarke's best atten- 
tion. In the meantime, we are quite sure that Mr. Clarke will 
concur with Mr. Bakewell in soliciting all possible information 
on the temperature of Artesian wells, and on any point in the 
subject under consideration, from any correspondent. — J. D.

Polyommatus Aleocis, Tcarwi, and Icdrius. (VI. 54<4.) — In 
reply to Mr. Conway, I must observe that Polyommatus 
Alexis of Stephens is P. I'carus of Lewin, Haworth, and 
others. Accordingly, no species is enumerated under the 
specific name of Tcarus by Stephens nor by Wood ; each of 
these authors, however, gives P. Icarius as a species, though 
the former, at least, doubts its being really distinct from P. 
Alexis. " It approximates," says Mr. Stephens, '« so very 
closely to the following species [P. Alexis], that, I conceive, 
it will eventually prove a mere variety of that insect." Pro- 
bably the similarity between the names of I'carus and Icarius 
has misled Mr. Conway. I cannot but join this gentleman in 
his regret (VI. 542.) that the under sides of more of the Papi- 
lionidse are not figured in Wood's Index Entomologicus : " a 
deficiency greatly to be lamented," and one which, I hope, 
may yet be supplied.

of " laborious.'* But it cannot be supposed that, till we have 
perused it, we should recommend the adoption of the views 
which it contains, some of which we can hardly appreciate 
from this preliminary abridgment. It shall be our business, 
however, to dissect hastily and briefly these fifty pages of 
prospectus : — 

The groimdwork of M. de Bylandt's reasoning process 
are the principles, that accurate observation is the basis of 
truth in science, that every thing in nature has an ordained 
end and object, that nothing happens by chance, that there 
are an equilibrium and a harmony between all the divisions 
of matter, and that there is neither increase nor decrease 
in its composing particles, (p. 1 — 7.) These principles are 
next applied to the doctrine of volcanoes, (p. 8.) To in- 
vestigate these, he is led to consider the doctrine of the 
elevation of mountains, (p. II.) This elevation our author 
attributes to Jour causes, sometimes isolated, sometimes united. 
The eruption of the central fire {feu igne central) at " the 
beginning ; " the sinking down of the mineral crust after its 
stretching to the top of its elasticity ; the " eboulement " of a 
part of the strata into profound depths, produced by the 
pressure of waters, which explains the obliquity of contra- 
dictory beds in the same mountain ; and the lifting up of 
the outer crust by interior pressure in the direction of certain 
radii of the globe, when the diminution of the central fire 
could only elevate those points which offered least resistance, 
to which is attributed the vertical direction of certain rocks 
and strata.

To investigate this, the author visited all the mountain 
chains of Europe, from the Caucasus to the Pyrenees, the 
analysis of the latter of which, during two summers, he com- 
pared with the studies of nine consecutive years amongst the 
Alps. There he observed the play of the elementary fluids; 
and noticing that the mountains possess a particular attrac- 
tion from the west, declining to the south, and that it is imper- 
ceptible to the east, and null towards the north, he discovered 
that the electric fluid constantly follows the sun, rises with 
him to the zenith, sinks with his rays, and disappears in his 
absence, (p. 12.) This phenomenon attaches only to moun- 
tains of the second and third classes as to height; for in 
snow-clad mountains an electric current is perceptible from 
N. to S. at from 7000 to 8000 feet, corresponding to the 
latitude of from 60° to 70°. Now, the aurora boreal is shows 
that this fluid there abandons the globe, and therefore it 
ought to bend from N. to S. at an angle of 45°. The tables 
given by Franklin and Back show that the aurorae which 
appear between 60° and 70° cease at 70°, and their axes 
are directed to the S., reappearing at the equator, at the 
height ofl7j 500 ft., under the name of the zodiacal light; which 
exactly agrees with the inferences derived from the currents 
in the polar seas, whose influence diminishes inversely with 
the angle of direction, ceasing at 55'^ N. and 40° S, Hum- 
boldt remarked the force of electricity at the height named ; 
and M. de Bylandt on Mont Blanc, at 8700 ft., which cor- 
responds there with the latitude in question, (p. 13.) 

M. de Bylandt then states, that in 1818, at the height of 
20,700 ft. under the equator, which correspond with 10,500 ft. 
of Mont Blanc and 85° N. lat., the caloric had not enough 
activity to form ice, but that above there was nothing but 
perpetual snow. Parry, Heemskerke, Franklin, &c., are 
brought in to show there is a great correspondence between 
the glaciers of the Alps and the Polar Sea.* It seems that 
our author compared his calculations with Captain Back's 
at Naples, and also in London with those of Parry and 
Franklin, and that the results were iwnderfidly coincident^ so 
that he assumed the magnetic pole from 81° 57' to 83° N. 

* Of this the writer of these remarks has no doubt. The coast of 
Greenland was first frozen up in the year 1348 (the year of the " black 
death"), and in 1817 (the year of the cholera) that coast began to be 
disengaged. Now records attest that, previously to 1348, a straight path 
lay over Mont Blanc, where now the glaciers are, into Italy,* and it is 
known that recently there has been a diminution of ice and snow on the 
same mountain. This is not the place to avail himself of the deduction 
he wishes to draw ; but these facts correspond with the observations of 
M. deBylandt.— Fr. J?. (7.

discovering that on Chimborazo the magnetic power ceased 
at 20,700ft. corresponding with 10,500 ft. of Mont Blanc, 
and the level of the sea at 83° N. lat. (p. 14.) Captain Ross 
has recently determined the magnetic pole to be more south- 
ward, in lat. 71° — 72°. But this by no means throws over 
a// the count's arguments. Our author proceeds (p. 15.) to 
treat on the fluids by whose separation matter was originally 
developed : -^ 1 . The ethereal universal fluid ; 2. Caloric. 
3. Light ; and, 4, 5, their auxiliaries, the electric and the 
magnetic fluids ; lastly, that fluid which *is combined of all, 
volcanic Jire. Under these impressions he investigated the 
course of natural phenomena, and the results will be laid 
before the public in the forthcoming work. Some of them 
we state here. The parallelism of volcanoes is the first: 
they never appear isolated. The fluids above-mentioned 
depend on the sun; and their influences cease at 80° N. and 
65° S. The points of intersection of the equator and the 
ecliptic are correspondent with similar points of intersection 
between the equator and the course of the volcanic fire, the 
latter of which are visible: the line of junction of these points 
making an angle of 5° with the earth's radius, and this angle 
being the constant measure of the divergence of all the vol- 
canic radii, horizontal or vertical. (There is some difficulty 
in understanding the count's meaning in this place, arising 
from a want of perspicuity.) But he states that the slopes 
of the summits of volcanoes, opened by the flow of lava, are 
all towards the equator, with a trifling inclination to the west, 
(p. 17.) He next assigns to the Gulf of Mexico, as M. de 
Humboldt has done before, the central seat of volcanic fire, 
taking the correspondent inverse focus to be in the Archi- 
pelago of the Molucca Islands. Forming a circle on the 
volcanic equator round these islands as a centre, and dividing 
it into segments of 10°, he found that radii drawn through 
these points passed through the lines of direction, and to 
the limit of all the volcanoes in the globe. 1st, to 90°, passes 
by the Philippine Islands, Manilla, and China. 2d, to 80°, 
follows a nearly similar course. 3d, to 70°, commences at 
the Isle of Niphon and finishes at Japan. 4th, to 60°, forms 
the chain which passes through the Kurile Islands and ex- 
tends to Kamtschatka about 70° N. lat., which with Iceland 
and Jan Mayen's Island (about 70°) seems to limit the vol- 
canic action to that latitude. 5th, to 50°, passes by Ma- 
gellan's Island to Behring's Strait. 7th, to 30°, forms the 
volcanoes of the Marian Islands. 8th, to 20°, forms the vol- 
canoes of the Caroline Islands. 9th, to 10° extends to the 
Sandwich Islands, (p. 19.)

The same division is made from the Gulf of Mexico as 
a centre, and a similar result obtained, (p. 20.) The cur- 
rents of the ocean are attributed to the volcanic action, which 
is said to correspond exactly with the lines of magnetic and 
aerial phenomena, (p. 22.) The author flatters himself that 
he has discovered a volcanic canal flowing round the globe 
between two parallels, and concludes that volcanoes are like 
knots on a string, which must partake any shock commu- 
nicated to either extremity (p. 24.), quoting his examples 
from the known localities, (p. 26.) 

He next proceeds to examine the nature of the volcanic fire, 
which, he says, is purely material, arising from infiltration 
and fermentation (p. 26.) of gases, and water, and the mate- 
rials of the strata it traverses ; these being dissolved, com- 
bined, and reunited. To volcanoes acted on by the sea, 
the author attributes the great partial catastrophe which has 
desolated our hemisphere, and which, by the junction of the two 
oceans, under the name of the great cataclysm (the deluge), 
has produced the diluvial effects which the earth exhibits, 
(p. 28.) He explains by this means the currents directed 
towards the west, and the immense ravages in the coasts of 
the continents of Africa, America, and Europe, and the 
separation of the two former quarters of the globe, once 
united, as proved by the traces of African civilisation in 
Mexico, (p. 30.) The elevation of mountain chains is also 
made to result from this cataclysm, and the Pyrenees are 
quoted as the example, (p. 31.) 

M. de Bylandt next classifies volcanoes into — I. Sub- 
marine ; II. Volcanoes " a decouvert ; " which are subdivided 
into — 1, Direct volcanoes, situated on the great canal; 2. 
Indirect, on the extremities of the lateral branches ; 3. Vol- 
canoes in permanent action ; 4", Extinct or mud volcanoes ; 
5. Volcanoes of air ; 6. Volcanoes of smoke ; 7. False vol- 
canoes, or simply burning hills (such, we suppose, as the 
cliffs near Weymouth), (p. 32.) 

A long illustration of another position follows, namely, 
that the size and height of volcanoes are proportioned to 
the force of the volcanic fire and the depth whence it rises. 
The formation of volcanic cones is next mathematically shown 
by a system of triangles upon the base of the volcano, and the 
height of the cone and depth of the crater proved to be pro- 
portionably determined by a general law, whilst the depth of 
the crater is made to be a third part of the primitive height 
of the volcano, (p. 35.) Here, again, we are a little at fault. 
Vesuvius is the subject of the experiment to exhibit the truth 
of these theories. 



sur la Theorie des Volcans. 87 

A singular fact, before pointed out by other writers, is next 
commented on; viz., that all volcanoes to the north of the 
equator have all their orifices to the west, and constantly 
discharge their lavas to the south; while those to the south of 
the equator as invariably follow an opposite direction, (p. 35.) 
Strombolo being an exception, the author accounts for it by 
assuming that the great cataclysm removed the original crater 
and made a breach lower down in the N.N.W. side. The 
action of the ejected materials is said to be spiral in the 
crater, and the parabolas described by the projectiles to be 
from an axis turned to the south, (p. 37.) The exciting 
cause of volcanic action is attributed to sea water finding 
its way to the fermenting matter, producing increased heat 
and dilatation of gases ; the change being proportioned to the 
calibre of the volcano, and when it exceeds this destroying 
the volcano, (p. 37.) This spiral motion of the materials 
in action may, perhaps, be borne out by the circular motion 
in earthquakes; but M. de Bylandt does not allude to it. A 
second cause of excitement is attributed to atmospheric air 
rushing down so as to produce regular respirations. The deto« 
nations are referred to the noise occasioned by the separation 
of the molecules in the rocky masses acted on, and the evolu- 
tion of hydrogen gas, combined with electric shocks, (p. 38.) 
The flow of lava is said to be uniform, and to follow the direc- 
tion of the axis of the crater ; and examples are quoted where 
lava streams have been diverted from their direction, by 
walls at an angle ; as in the case of the eruption of ] 669, 
when the garden wall of the Benedictine convent saved the 
city of Catania. In 1831-32, the author also tried the 
experiment, and says that it is possible, by taking advantage 
of the slowness of the current, to prevent its ravages, (p. 39.) 
We have no space for the calculations of the author on the 
heights and forces of volcanoes : but we may mention that 
he divides lavas, as follows, into seven classes : — I. Lithoid ; 
2. Compact; 3. Trachites; 4. Basaltic; 5. Obsidian or vi- 
treous; 6. Scoriae; 7. Pumice. He, moreover, adds, that 
the materials differ according to different situations and dif- 
ferent epochs of each. (p. 42.) 

Such are the principal subjects to be discussed in M. de 
Bylandt's work, of which the ^^ avant-propos^' gives an out- 
line. The first volume is to contain an introduction in con- 
nection with La Place's theory of the world, ending with 
an account of the causes and effects of the currents of the 
sea and the trade winds, and Captain Franklin's tables of 
magnetic phenomena, (p. 4-3.) The second volume is to em- 
brace the effects of water in motion, the parallel between the 

o 4

Alps and the Pyrenees, and the application of the theory to 
the volcanoes of Europe, commencing with Sicily ; noticing, 
also, the circumstance of the decreased action of volcanoes in 
extent of country affected being counterbalanced by the pro- 
portionate increase of force. Etna and Vesuvius are also to 
be carefully considered, (p. 46.) The third volume is to con- 
tain the volcanic history of France, Dalmatia, and Italy. 
The fourth volume is to treat of the branch of the counter- 
current which passes under the Gulf of St. Euphemia, in 
lat. 39° N., embracing Calabria, &c., and concluding with an 
analysis of all particulars connected with Vesuvius, (p. 47.) 

A classification of the operations of volcanoes is also added, 
in eight distinct portions: — ]. Real eruptions. 2. Demi- 
eruptions. 3. Eruptions in the radial lines. 4. Partial erup- 
tions from interior galleries. 5. Interior eruptions not ejecting 
lavas. 6. Eruptions of water, cinders, and mud. 7. Lavas 
of reconstruction. 8. Emanations of inflammable gas. A 
body of maps will be appended, to illustrate the subject, 
drawn up after careful surveys and accurate comparison with 
undoubted authorities. 

Such a work, if properly accomplished, must be an acqui- 
sition to science ; and, for the facts introduced, must be valu- 
able. Of the opinions or theories of M. de Bylandt we 
cannot here speak; thebroc/mre before us is but a concise abridg- 
ment by way of prospectus, and we have given attention to 
it in this second ^^ Resume Preliminaire," in the hope of calling 
the attention of our readers to an interesting subject, on which 
we have at present no positive information ; volcanoes being, 
like comets, subject hitherto to as many speculations as 
there are investigators. " Quot homines tot sententiae." 
Count Bylandt adds another to the list of commentators, and 
if his doctrines obtain the weight he attaches to them, he 
may indeed exult in his proof of the epigraph on the present 
pamphlet : — 

" There are more things in heaven and earth 
Than are dreamt of in our philosophy." 

The italics are his own. We must wait to see to whom the 
" our " applies. He seems to himself to have cut the Gor- 
dian knot, and, in a strain of anticipated triumph, reminds 
us of the risk we run in adding more, quoting, in conclusion, 
the words on the tomb of Marshal Saxe —

The date of publication of this book marks an epoch in 
the progress of natural history in Britain. 

One of Euclid's postulates is, " a circle may be described 
from any centre, at any distance from that centre:" so, in 
nature, there is not an object which may not become the centre 
of a thousand associating circumstances. The systematist 
encircles every object with a series of considerations on its 
affinities and distinctive characters ; the economist, with his 
calculations on the answers it will bear to his grand testing 
question of cut bono ? the sentimentalist, with his halo of 
" pleasing thoughts and kindly emotions;" others with other 
considerations, but none with evil ones ; for, as Sir James 
Edward Smith has said, " in nature, all is elegance and de- 
light; and none but the most foolish or depraved can derive 
any thing from it but what is beautiful, or associate with its 
lovely objects any but the most amiable or most hallowed 
images." Thus far good and true ; and it only remains that 
each party perceive the propriety and the duty of depre- 
cating, in spirit and in practice, that exclusive feeling, which, 
if not deprecated, would lead him to deem the circle de- 
scribed by the student of a taste distinct from himself, less 
noble in diameter than the circle which he himself describes. 
This premised, it is time to state that the volume before us is 
one filled to overflowing with a collection of the " pleasing 
thoughts and kindly emotions" which sentimental naturalists 
have, from time to time, encircled around, and associated with, 
certain and many of the innumerable objects of nature. 

Sentimental naturalists, at least those of them who have de- 
scribed the feelings and ideas which natural objects have excited 
within them, have been fewer; have awakened into action 
later; and, consequently, have fewer followers, admirers, and 
pupils, than other students in nature, who have been longer 
in the field, and have, by their more multiplied researches and 
discoveries, rendered themselves more rich and more capable 
of enriching others of tastes congenial to their own. The 
present little volume shows something, a good deal — for, per- 
haps, two more such volumes would hold all — of what has been 
done in sentimental natural history; and the reason why we 
think that it marks an epoch in the progress of natural history 
in Britain is, that it is significant to see the teachers in the 
sentimentality of natural history so numerous as this little 
volume shows them to be, and the day arrived when the (other 
or) precursory branches of natural history have been so

familiarised " to the business and bosoms of men" as to make it 
safe to risk the expense of publishing a volume of sentimental 
poems, and scraps of poetry, on the objects with which natural 
history acquaints us. We wish the author of the compilation 
all success : he deserves it.

Very cheap, the pictures striking, and doubtless as accu- 
rate as the nature of the materials and facilities extant, which, 
we believe, are neither excellent nor numerous, for producing 
such a work, will admit. Stuffed specimens, and the plates 
of M. Lesson, in his work on the Trochilides, most of these 
probably derived from stuffed specimens, are the main sources 
of the figures. In the existence of this case, we presume it 
is necessary to associate with the pictures the consideration 
of the possibility of error in the attitude, and symmetry of 
disposition of the parts, of almost every bird. Indeed, we have 
learned that the birds are placed on the branches in a very 
faulty manner. In the pictures, their feet and legs are ob- 
vious enough. In life and nature, when the birds are upon 
branches, you never can have a view of their thighs or legs ; 
and, at the very farthest, you can only now and then get a 
sight of their toes. A remarkable feature in the humming- 
bird is the shortness of its legs, which are always concealed in 
the thick and puff-like plumage of the abdomen ; so that, when 
the bird is sitting or flying, you can never see its legs ; and 
the only means to get a view of them is catching the bird itself. 
The spirit of the text is the names, synonymes, dimensions, 
proportions, colours, structure, and systematic affinities of the 
species; but is devoid of those poetical notices of habits which, 
in a treatise on such lovely creatures, we can but wish were 
supplied. At the end of the volume there is a systematic 
synopsis of the species of humming-birds, with their names 
and distinctive characteristics. The memoir of Pennant, pre- 
fixed to the volume, imparts much useful information. The 
frontispiece is a portrait of Pennant. 

The Natural History of Humming-hirdSi notwithstanding the 
qualifying considerations which we have suggested to apper- 
tain to its merits, will, we conceive, conduce to two excellent 
effects. It will lead general admirers of the forms and hues 
of created beings to examine them in the spirit of the science 
of natural history, and thus extend that science; and the 
work will, at the same time, become a point to which those 
of British naturalists who may have opportunities to supply

Edinburgh, London, and Dublin, 1833. 6s. 

The contents of the volume are, a chapter on the physical 
characters of parrots, a chapter on the intellectual and imita- 
tive faculties of parrots, a chapter on the geographical distri- 
bution of parrots, and, then, descriptions and coloured figures 
of thirty-five species of parrots. At the end of the volume are 
illustrations of the terminology used in describing birds ; at the 
beginning, a portrait and a biographical sketch of Audubon. 

In the commencement of the enumeration of physical cha- 
racters, " the toe of the parrot is made to tread" somewhat 
" too near the heel of the courtier ;" for there is grave talking 
about an analogical connection in structure between man, 
monkeys, and parrots. The rest of the " physical characters," 
although they are not sorted into the most orderly succession, 
nor unclogged with some repetitions which betray crudity, are 
worthy of regard, and of a proportion of the book's price. 

The dissertation on the " intellectual and imitative facul- 
ties of parrots," we leave to — to whom? — It may be dis- 
respectful to our grandams to say. 

The *' geographical distribution of parrots" is inane enough. 
In the pictures, prodigious capacity of claws is given to some 
of the birds ; most of them grasp, as a perch, a tree with 
ease. Plates 14-. 9. 29., and some few others, are more con- 
sistent with common sense in this particular. It is needful 
that the reader pay attention to the dimensions of each bird 
as set down in the text; for, in the pictures, one of 6 in. in 
length is pretty well of the same magnitude as one of 2^ ft. 
or 3 ft. Birds have great versatility of neck, we know ; and 
we presume that plate ] 3. is an illustration of an extreme 
instance of this versatility.

gists. This number completes the first volume of the work, 
and has a full accompaniment of titlepage, indexes, errata,

With this number, which completes the first volume, price

entomology at heart," to afford, by the purchase of the first 
volume, those who have originated this work and advanced, 
voluntarily and for the sake of science alone, their responsi- 
bility for its pecuniary support, " the means of continuing 
their exertions, and prosecuting their undertaking." This 
appeal we are happy to be able, on the best authority, to 
state has not been made in vain. Owing to the liberal 
support advanced by a few true naturalists, there is now no 
prospect of the cessation of the Entomological Magazine, This 
is gladdening news. 

No. VI., for .January, ISS^ (the first number of the second 
volume), will and does (for we have been shown the land of 
promise) contain the following communications; — 1. Col- 
loquia Entomologica ; by Corderius Secundus. Four lovers 
of nature, of natural history, entomology, and the Entomo- 
logical Magazine^ are made to discourse much (12 pages), and 
merrily, on men and things thereto appertaining. — 2. Mo- 
nographia Chalcidum ; by F. Walker, Esq. F.L.S. In this 
continuation of the monograph (from vol. i. p. 446.), the fa- 
milies Leuc6psid£E and (?halcidiclae are described. The first 
includes but the genus Leucopsis; the second, seven genera. 
The characters of the genera and species are given in great de- 
tail, and numerous synonymes are cited. Mr. Walker describes 
several species from the neighbourhood of Paris, communicated 
by M. F. de Laporte, and some derived from the Island of St. 
Vincent, taken there by the late Rev. Lansdown Guilding 
(p. 13. to 39.). — 3. Capture of Insects at Burghfield ; by the 
Rev. C. S. Bird, M. A. F.L.S. This is a most interesting com- 
munication. Mr. Bird supplies a list of those of the species of 
insects, not quite common, which he has captured during ten 
years' residence at Burghfield. He has been most successful in 
the order Lepidoptera. " This success I owe to the use of a 
lamp to attract moths. During the moonless nights of summer, 
I sit with a sinumbra lamp, and perhaps one or two smaller 
lamps, placed on a table, close to the window. The moths 
speedily enter the room, if the weather be warm. I have had a 
levee of more than a hundred between the hours of ten and

twelve. In the spring, too, and autumn, I have been frequently 
fortunate, though generally having my patience sufficiently 
tried. ... If, at any time of the year, a warm mist pervade the 
air, there is almost a certainty of success." At cool times of the 
year, the window is kept shut till the moths knock for admit- 
tance. Reading and writing may be combined with this plan 
of mothing. " Moths are extremely sensible of any keenness 
in the air : a north or east wind is very likely to keep them 
from venturing abroad. Different species have different hours 
of flight. ... I have, for experiment's sake, sat up in the sum- 
mer till three o'clock, when the whole heaven was bright with 
the rising sun, and moths of various kinds have never ceased 
arriving in succession till that time. Some of them must come 
from a considerable distance. Scotophilaporphyrea, being a 
heath moth, must have come nearly a mile." Not only the 
Nocturna have come to Mr. Bird in the night, but '' the Se- 
midiurna, the Geometridae, accompany them at all hours. 
Many coleopterous insects are also attracted . . . sometimes 
swarms of gnats . . . the house cricket once or twice. Redii- 
vius personatus has been amongst my captives/ A few com- 
mon ichneumons and 7ipul8e are frequent guests." What a 
world of interest these successive visiters must induce in a 
summer's night. Surely an entomologist must, while thus 
sitting and observing, have, like Shakspeare, a rich ** Mid- 
summer Night's Dream " of his own ! Mr. Bird illustrates 
many of his remarks (and we have given but a sample of 
them) by adducing the names of the insects whose manners 
those remarks describe. His list follows, with those species 
distinguished " which he does not take by the lamp." — 
4. Thoughts on the Geographical Distribution of Insects ; by 
Delta. This is professed to be written with a trembling hand; 
but the author seems to have fortified himself very strongly

notices in illustration, written playfully and pleasingly, in 
agreeable relief to the severer, that is, more strictly technical, 
nature of the thesis. Would we had volumes full of such 
notices on insects as that supplied on the dragon fly in p. 67. 
The end for which Mr. Newman labours is the establishment 
of a uniform nomenclature of the parts of insects ; for, until 
we can speak of the various parts of insects in common terms, 
a reciprocal communication of ideas between those who study 
insects (and every one who loves nature must) cannot take 
place. We wish his amiably intended, and, we believe, ex- 
cellently executed, labours all regard, and cordially commend 
them, and the nomenclature he has proposed for the parts of 
the head of insects, to the analytical examination of every 
entomologist. — VII. Essay on the Classification of parasitic

who, from the earliest records till now, has written on, or in 
any way mentioned cases of, the occurrence of entozoa and

valuable, were it only as supplying a concise and essential

and down in numerous and expensive books on medicine.

previously recorded ones, occupy 40 pages. Pages 41. to

variable. The decisions of nature soon cut asunder the 
artificial arrangements of man. To acquire a true knowledge 
of the history of nations, we must study the physical structure 
of the soil, for this is the leading feature on which historical 
details are always dependent. Mountains, seas, and oceans, 
rivers, lakes, deserts, and forests, form natural divisions on 
the surface of the earth, which serve as boundaries to the 
several empires." The relative influence of these is then

Art. I. On designating Genera and Subgenera, and on the Prin- 
ciples of Classification which they involve. [VI. 385. 4-81. 485., 
VIL 62. to 66.^ By the Rev. Leonard Jenyns, A.M. F.L.S. 

Mr. Strickland seems (VII. 62.) to infer, from what I 
have written (VI. 385.) on the subject of classification, that 
my plan is " to distinguish subgenera by signs or letters." 
I beg to stcite that he has misunderstood me entirely. So far 
from adopting this plan, I am of opinion that in all cases sub- 
genera should be named. What. I remarked (which, I pre- 
sume, led Mr. Strickland to this inference) was, that many 
modern genera had been established on characters too trivial 
and unimportant to entitle them even to the rank of sub- 
genera ; and I intimated that, where such had been adopted 
principally with a view to convenience, and because of the 
large immber of species contained in the old groups of which 
they formed portions, it would have been better to have sub- 
stituted for them mere sectional divisions, indicated by signs. 

V^ith respect to the much agitated question as to whether 
we are to employ the name of the genus or subgenus in de- 
signating any species we may wish to speak of, it appears to 
me it must be left in a great measure open for each individual 
to decide as he pleases. It would be difficult to lay down 
any rule, on such a subject, which would be generally adopted. 
For my own part, I should say, that, on all ordinary occa- 
sions, it is quite sufficient to use the former only; but where 
1 was naming the species, with the particular view of point- 
ing out its affinities and its exact situation in the system, I 
should there employ both; and I should write the name cf 

Vol. VII. — No. . '58. ii

the subgenus in a parenthesis.* Thus, I should, usually say 
(speaking of the Lapland bunting), Emberiza lapponica ; but, 
in the particular instance just alluded to, Emberiza (Plectro- 
phanes) lapponica. 

I cannot forbear adding, on this occasion, that I fear I have 
been much misunderstood on the subject of the division of 
genera. The object of my former communication [VI. 385.3 
was not so much to find fault with the subdividing of old 
genera, where there may appear just ground for the sub- 
division, or the calling of the new groups by this title, if we 
object to the adoption of that of subgenera, as with the not 
appreciating the relation which these new groups bear to the 
old one, and to the other genera in the same family with 
which this old one was considered of equal value. Perhaps, 
however, my meaning will be rendered more intelligible than 
it was in that article, by the assistance of a diagram. Let us, 
then, suppose the family of ^rdeidss, for instance, and three 
of its included genera, to be represented in the following 
manner, — 



i4'rdea Ciconia Platalea ; 

assuming that the above three groups, placed in the same 
line, are of equal value amongst themselves, but all suboidi- 
nate to the one above, in which they are included, and which 
we here designate by the name of family. Suppose that, on 
farther investigation, we find that, in like manner as this 
family includes three genera f, so that one of these genera, 
say y^Vdea, includes also tliree subordinate groups. What 
do we do? We attach the same name, ^'rdea, though in a 
restricted sense, to that subordinate group which is more 
typical than the others; while to the remaining two we affix, 
perhaps, the new names of Botaurus and A^ycticorax; and 
w^e carry on the diagram in this manner, — 

^rdeidae 



^'rdea Ciconia Platalea 



-(4'rdea Botaurus JVycticorax ; 

in which we still have the old group ^'rdea held together by 
certain characters as before ; only we distinguish in it three 

* This is what Cuvier recommends, in his Hisfoire des Poissons, 4to edit, 
torn. ii. p. 41. note 1. In a former work he advises that, on ordinary occa- 
Bions, the name of the subgenus be suppressed. (Reg.A?!., tom.i. p. xvii.) 

f I am not really asserting that there are no other existing genera in 
this family, but merely selecting these three as sufficient for my argument.

minor groups, each of which has some additional characters 
peculiar to itself, of less importance than those common to 
all. Now, it is perfectly arbitrary in what point of view we 
choose to consider these three new groups; we may either 
affix names to them or not ; we may call them genera, if we 
please, or subgenera, or mere sections of the old genus yl'r- 
dea: but what we must ?ioi do (and here, I would observe, is 
the principal ground of my complaint) is, having determined 
them to be genera, first to abolish the original group ^'rdea, 
and then to place them on the same footing with Ciconia and 
Platalea *, in this manner, — 

Jrd^idEB 



A'rdea Botauras iV^ycticorax Ciconia Platalea; 

or, raising ^'rdea to the rank of a family, and the group 
which w^e here call ^rdeidas to one of a still higher deno- 
mination, not to raise Ciconia and Platalea also ; for these 
three groups, ^'rdea, Ciconia, and Platalea, having been 
assumed to be of equal value., it is clear that, whatever rank 
we assign to one of them, we must assign the same to all. 

I am unwilling to extend this communication, or I should 
make some comment on the objections which Mr. Newman 
has brought forward (VI. 485.) against the expressions which 
I adopted in my former article. [VI. 385.] I shall simply 
observe, that, when I talk of principles of classification, I do 
not mean principles of my own setting up, as that gentleman 
seems to think, but such as have been laid down by those 
who have studied most deeply the philosophy of the science, 
and such as are generally acknowledged by all professed 
naturalists. Of this nature is the only principle to which I 
had occasion to allude ; viz., that all groups hearing the same 
title should he groups of the same value, 

I conceive that every systematist would assent to this prin- 
ciple, at the same time that no one would ever think of assert- 
ing that it was now, for the first time, brought forward and 
offered to his notice.

too Ohscrvntioiis o?i tlie Habits of the JRooL 

Art, II. Observations on the Habits of the Rooh. 
By Charles Waterton, Esq. 

Last year I partly promised [V. 241.] that, on some dis- 
mal winter\s evening, I would sit me down, and write the 
history of the rook. I'he period has now arrived. Nothing 
can be more gloomy and tempestuous than the present aspect 
of the heavens. The wind is roarinfj throujjh the naked 
branches of the sycamores, the rain beats fiercely on the 
eastern windows, and the dashing of the waves against the 
walls of the island warns ns that one of November's dark and 
stormy nights is close at hand ; such a night, probably, as 
that in which Tam O'Shanter unfortunately peeped into Kirk 
Alloway. Foreigners tell us that on these nights Englishmen 
are prone to use the knife, or a piece of twisted hemp, to calm 
their agitated spirits. For my own part, I must say that I 
have an insuperable repugnance to such anodynes; and, were 
a host of blue devils, conjured up by November's fogs, just 
now to assail me, I would prefer combating the phantoms 
with the weapons of ornithology, rather than run any risk of 
disturbing the economy of my jugular vein, by a process 
productive of very unpleasant sensations, before it lulls one 
to rest. 

According to my promise, I will now pen down a few re- 
marks on the habits of the rook, which bird, in good old 
sensible times, was styled frugilegus. It is now pronounced 
to he 2)y(^d(^torins. Who knows but that our great ones in 
ornithology may ultimately determine to call it up to the house 
of hawks ? 

If this useful bird were not so closely allied to the carrion 
crow in colour and in shape, we should see it sent up to the 
tables of the rich, as often as we see the pigeon. But pre- 
judice forbids the appearance of broiled rook in the lordly 
mansion. If we wish to partake of it, we must repair to the 
cottage of the lowly swain, or, here and there, to the hall of 
the homely country squire, whose kitchen has never been 
blessed by the presence of a first-rate cook, and whose yearn- 
ings for a good and wholesome dish are not stifled by the. 
fear of w^hat a too highly polished world will say. 

There is no wdld bird in England so completely gregarious 
as the rook ; or so regular in its daily movements. The ring- 
doves will assemble in countless multitudes, the finches will 
unite in vast assemblies, and waterfowl will flock in thousands 
to the protecterl lake, during the dreary months of winter: 
but, when the returning sun spreads joy and consolation over 
the face of nature, their congregated numbers are dissolved, 



Observations on the Habits of the B.ook. 101 

and the individuals retire in pairs to propagate their respective 
species. The rook, however, remains in society the year 
throughout. In flocks it builds its nest, in flocks it seeks 
for food, and in flocks it retires to roost. 

^ About two miles to the eastward of this place are the 
woods of Nostell Priory, where, from time immemorial, the 
rooks have retired to pass the night. I suspect, by the ob- 
servations which I have been able to make on the morning 
and evening transit of these birds, that there is not another 
roosting-place for, at least, thirty miles to the westward of 
Nostell Priory. Every morning, from within a few days of 
the autumnal to about a week before the vernal equinox, the 
rooks, in congregated thousands upon thousands, fly over this 
valley in a westerly direction, and return in undiminished 
numbers to the east an hour or so before the night sets in. 
In their morning passage, some stop here ; others, in other 
favourite places farther and farther on ; no\y repairing to the 
trees for pastime, now resorting to the fields for food, till the 
declining sun warns those which have gone farthest to the 
westward that it is time they should return. They rise in a 
mass, receiving additions to their numbers from every inter- 
vening place, till they reach this neighbourhood in an amazing 
flock. Sometimes they pass on without stopping, and are 
joined by those which have spent the day here. At other 
times they make my park their place of rendezvous, and cover 
the ground in vast profusion, or perch upon the surrounding 
trees. After tarrying here for a certain time, every rook 
takes wing. They linger in the air for a while, in slow 
revolving circles, and then they all proceed to Nostell Priory, 
which is their last resting-place for the night. In their morn- 
ing and evening passage, the loftiness or lowliness of their 
flight seems to be regulated by the state of the weather. 
When it blows a hard gale of wind, they descend the valley 
with astonishing rapidity, and just skim over the tops of the 
intervening hills, a few feet above the trees : but, when the 
sky is calm and clear, they pass through the heavens at a 
great height, in regular and easy flight. 

Sometimes these birds perform an evolution, which is, in 
this part of the country, usually called the shooting of the 
rooks. [V. 239.] Farmers tell you that this shooting por- 
tends a coming wind. He who pays attention to the flight of 
birds has, no doubt, often observed this downward movement. 
When rooks have risen to an immense height in the air, so 
that, in appearance, they are scarcely larger than the lark, 
tliey suddenly descend to the ground, or to the tops of trees 
exactly under them. To effect this, they come headlong 



102 Observations on the Habits of the Rook, 

down, on pinion a little raised, but not expanded, in a zig-zag 
direction (presenting, alternately, their back and breast to 
you), through the resisting air, which causes a noise similar 
to that of a rushing wind. This is a magnificent and beau- 
tiful sight to the eye of an ornithologist. It is idle to suppose 
for a moment that it portends wind. It is merely the ordi- 
nary descent of the birds to an inviting spot beneath them, 
where, in general, some of their associates are already assem- 
bled, or where there is food to be procured. When we 
consider the prodigious height of the rooks at the time they 
begin to descend, we conclude that they cannot effect their 
arrival at a spot perpendicular under them, by any other 
process so short and rapid. 

Rooks remain with us the year throughout. If there were 
a deficiency of food, this would not be the case ; for, when 
birds can no longer support themselves in the place which 
they have chosen for their residence, they leave it, and go in 
quest of nutriment elsewhere. Thus, for want of food, my- 
riads of wildfowl leave the frozen north, and repair to milder 
climates; and in this immediate district, when there is but a 
scanty sprinkling of seeds on the whitethorn bush, our flocks of 
fieldfares and of redwings bear no proportion to those in 
times of a plentiful supply of their favourite food. But the 
number of rooks never visibly diminishes ; and on this account 
we may safely conclude that, one way or other, they always 
find a sufficiency of food. Now, if we bring, as a charge 
against them, their feeding upon the industry of man, as, for 
example, during the time of a hard frost, or at seedtime, or 
at harvest, at which periods they will commit depredations, if 
not narrowly watched, we ought, in justice, to put down in 
their favour the rest of the year, when they feed entirely upon 
insects. Should we wish to know tiie amount of noxious 
insects destroyed by rooks, we have only to refer to a most 
valuable and interesting paper on the services of the rook, 
signed T. G. Clitheroe, Lancashire, which is given in Vol. VI. 
p. 142. of this Magazine. I wish every farmer in England 
would read it. They would then be convinced how much the 
rook befriends them. 

Some author (I think, Goldsmith) informs us that the 
North American colonists got the notion into their heads that 
the purple grakle was a great consumer of their maize [I. 47.]» 
and these wise men of the west actually offered a reward of 
threepence for the killed dozen of the plunderers. This 
tempting boon soon caused the country to be thinned of 
grakles, and then myriads of insects appeared, to put the 
good people in mind of the formSr plagues of Egypt. They

damaged the grass to such a fearful extent, that, in 1749, the 
rash colonists were obhged to procure hay from Pennsylvania, 
and even from England, Buffon mentions that grakles were 
brought from India to Bourbon, in order to exterminate the 
grasshoppers. The colonists, seeing these birds busy in the 
new-sown fields, fancied that they were searching for grain, 
and instantly gave the alarm. The poor grakles were pro- 
scribed by government, and in two hours after the sentence 
was passed, not a grakle remained in the island. The grass- 
hoppers again got the ascendency, and then the deluded 
islanders began to mourn for the loss of their grakles. The 
governor procured four of these birds from India, about eight 
years after their proscription, and the state took charge of 
their preservation. Laws were immediately framed for their 
protection; and, lest the people should have a hankering for 
grakle pie, the physicians were instructed to proclaim the 
flesh of the grakle very unwholesome food. Whenever I see 
a flock of rooks at work in a turnip field, which, in dry wea- 
ther, is often the case, I know that they have not assembled 
there to eat either the turnips or the tops, but that they are 
employed in picking out a grub, which has already made a 
lodgement in the turnip. 

Last spring, I paid a visit, once a day, to a carrion crow's 
nest on the top of a fir tree. In the course of the morn- 
ing in which she had laid her fifth egg, I took all the 
eggs out of the nest, and in their place I put two rooks' 
eggs, which were within six days of being hatched. The 
carrion crow attended on the stranger eggs, just as though 
they had been her own, and she raised the young of them 
with parental care. When they had become sufficiently large, 
I took them out of the nest, and carried them home. One of 
them was sent up to the gamekeeper's house, with proper 
instructions ; the other remained with me. Just at this time 
an old woman had made me a present of a barn-door Iien» 
" Take it, Sir," said she, " and welcome ; for, if it stays here 
any longer, we shall be obliged to kill it. When we get up to 
wash in the morning, it crows like a cock. All its feathers 
are getting like those of a cock ; it is high time that it was 
put out of the way, for when hens turn cocks people say that 
they are known to be very unlucky ; and, if this thing is 
allowed to live, we don*t know what may happen. It has 
great spurs on its legs, and last summer it laid four eggs. If 
I had had my own way, it would have been killed when it 
first began to crow.'' I received the hen with abundant 
thanks ; and, in return, I sent the old woman a full-bred 
Malay fowl. On examining tlie hen, I found her comb very 

H 4 



104^ Observations on the Habits of the Book, 

large ; the feathers on the neck and rump much elongated ; 
the spurs curved, and about l^in. long; the two largest 
feathers in her tail arched, and four or five smaller arched 
ones, of a beautiful and glossy colour, hanging down on each 
side of the tail. In a word, this hen had so masculine an 
appearance, that, when strangers looked at her, they all took 
her to be a cock, and it was with difficulty I persuaded them 
that she was a hen. We allowed her the range of a sheltered 
grass-plot, flanked on one side by holly trees, and open to the 
lake on the other. Here, also, was placed in a cage the 
young rook which I had taken from the nest of the carrion 
crow. The hen showed such an antipathy to it, that, when- 
ever I held it to her, she would immediately fly at it. When 
visiters came to inspect her, I had only to take the rook 
out of the cage, and pit it against her, when she would stand 
upright, raise the long feathers on her neck, and begin to 
cackle, cluck, and crow. One morning the rook had managed 
to push aside a bar in front of its cage. A servant, in passing 
by, looked into it, and missed the bird. The hen had also 
disappeared. On search being made, they were both found 
floating side by side, dead, in the lake below. We conjectured 
that the hen had pursued the I'ook after its escape from the 
cage, and that the wind, which blew very strong that morning, 
had forced them both into a vvatery grave. I had still one 
rook left at the gamekeeper's. It was kept in a cage, which 
was placed on a litde stand in his garden ; and I had given 
orders that upon no account was it to be allowed to go at large. 
The feathers remained firm at the base of the bill till tlie 
15th of August; on which day the keeper perceived that 
a few feathers had dropped from the lower mandible, and 
were lying at the bottom of the cage. In a couple of .weeks 
more, the lower mandible had begun to put on a white scurfy 
appearance, while here and there a few feathers had fallen 
from the upper one. This is the purport of the keeper's in- 
formation to me, on my return home from Bavaria. On the 
31st of the same month, a terrible storm set in. By what the 
keeper told me, the night must have been as dark and dismal 
as that in which poor King Lear stood in lamentation, and 
exposed his hoary locks to the four rude winds of heaven. 
A standard white-heart cherry tree, })erhaps the finest in 
Yorkshire, and which, for many generations, had been the 
pride and ornament of this place, lost two large branches 
during the gale ; and in the morning, when the keeper rose, 
he found the cage shattered and upset, and driven to the far- 
thest corner of his garden. The rook was quite dead. It 
had lost its life, either through the inclemency of that stormy

night, or through bruises received in the fall of the cage. 
Thus both the rooks were unlucky. The old woman, no 
doubt, could clearly trace their misfortunes to her crowing 
hen. However, the experiment with the two young rooks, 
though not perfect, has nevertheless been of some use. It 
has shown us that the carrion crow makes no distinction 
betwixt its own eggs and those of the rook ; that it can know 
nothing of the actual time required to sit upon eggs in order 
to produce the young ; that the young of the rook will thrive 
under the care of the carrion crow, just as well as under that 
of its own parents ; and finally, that the feathers fall off from 
the root of the rook's bill, by the order of nature, as was sur- 
mised by the intelligent Bewick, and not by the process of 
the bird's thrusting its bill into the earth, in search of food, 
as is the opinion of some naturalists. [III. 402., V. 241.] 

Tiie rook advances through the heavens with a very re- 
gular and a somewhat tardy beat of wing ; but it is capable of 
proceeding with great velocity when it chooses : witness its 
pursuit and attack on the sparrowhawk and kestrel. It is 
'apt to injure, in the course of" time, the elm trees on which it 
builds its nest, by nipping off the uppermost twigs. But this, 
after all, is mere conjecture. The damage may be caused by 
an accumulation of nests, or by the constant resort of such a 
number of birds to one tree. Certain, however, it is, that, 
when rooks have taken possession of an elm tree for the pur- 
pose of incubation, the uppermost branches of that tree are 
often subject to premature decay. 

Though the flocks of rooks appear to have no objection to 
keep company, from time to time, with the carrion crows, in a 
winter's evening, before they retire to roost, still I can never 
see a carrion crow build its nest in a rookery. There was 
always a carrion crow's nest here, in a clump of high Scotch 
pines, near the stables, till the rooks got possession of the 
trees ; the carrion cou})le then forsook the place : the rooks 
were dislodged from this clump of trees ; and then a pair of 
carrion crows (the same, for aught I know to the contrary) 
came and built their nest in it. 

The rook lays from three to five eggs, varying much, like 
those of the carrion crow, in colour, shape, and size. After 
the rooks have built, and even lined their nests, they leave 
them on the approach of night, to repair to the general ren- 
dezvous at Nostell Priory ; but, as soon as they begin to 
lay, they then no longer quit the irees at night, until they 
have reared their young. Wiien this has been ellected, we 
see large flocks of them resorting to the different woods of the 
neighbourhood to pass the night. This they continue to do^ 
till a few days before the autumnal equinox, when, for reasons 



106 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

which baffle all conjecture, they begin to pass over this valley 
every morning in a westerly direction, and return in the even- 
ing to their eastern roosting-place in the woods of Nostell 
Priory. 

Rooks are observed to keep up a very close and friendly 
intercourse with starhngs [VII. 183.] and jackdaws [VI. 394-. 
516.] ; but, on looking at them in the fields, the observer will 
perceive, that, while the jackdaws mix promiscuously with the 
rooks, both in their flight and in searching for food, the star- 
lings always keep in their own flock. This circumstartce 
has long engaged my attention ; but I am no farther advanced 
in the investigation than I was on the first day on which I 
set out. It is one of the many secrets in the habits of birds, 
which will, perhaps, be for ever concealed from our view.

Art. III. An Introduction to the Natural History of Molluscous 
Animals. In a Series of Letters. By G. J. 

Letter 12. On their Respiration, 

The respiration of the Mollusca is so slow, so little ob- 
vious, and so easily suspended for a time, that it is possible 
you may never have observed the process even in those 
species which daily cross your path. You will, therefore, in 
your next walk, please to examine the snail or the slug while 
they are in progression, and you will see them at intervals 
open wide a circular hole on the side of the neck and near 
the margin of the shield 'or collar, and, after dilating it to the 
utmost, they will close it again until its place becomes im- 
perceptible ; this they do about four times in a minute, ex- 
pelling at each time the effete air, and inhaling a fresh 
supply. In like manner, the aquatic tribes, while crawling 
along the surface, raise from time to time the pulmonary 
aperture, in order to emit the vitiated air, sometimes even 
with a crackling noise, and to receive an equal quantity 



their Respiration^ 107 

unadulterated before the aperture is shut. This process is 
not so obvious in the branchial Mollusca, and in many of 
them, from the position of the gills, such a function is not 
necessary to renew the water around them. Where, how- 
ever, the gills are strictly internal, it seems probable that the 
water is regularly changed when the creatures are in their 
natural habitats and undisturbed : we know that such is the 
case with the Cephalopoda, in which inspiration and ex- 
spiration are well marked. " The first is effected by a gradual 
dilatation of the sac in every direction, but particularly at the 
sides, accompanied by a subsidence of the lateral valves, col- 
lapse of the walls of the funnel, and a rush of water through 
the lateral openings into the sac. Inspiration being com- 
pleted, the lateral valves are closed, the sac is gradually 
contracted, the funnel erected and dilated, and the water ex- 
pelled through it with great force, and in a continued stream." 
Dr. Coldstream, from whose letter I quote the preceding 
sentence, has seen the stream emitted by an individual of the 
Octopus ventricosus, " whose sac measured about four inches 
in length, carry light bodies to the distance of eleven inches 
from the orifice of the funnel. Respiration is performed 
more frequently in young than in adult individuals. One, 
whose sac measured 1^- in. in length, I saw respire'lS times 
per minute ; and the larger one, mentioned above, respired 
10 times per minute. The time seemed to be pretty equally 
divided between inspiration and exspiration." In the bi- 
valves, whose cloak forms a shut sac, the water is sucked in 
through the siphonal tube, when the capacity of the sac is 
increased by its own expansion, or by the opening of the 
shells ; and by its muscular contraction, aided sometimes by 
the closure of the shells, it is again expelled in a stream from 
the anal siphon : but there is no regularity in the process in 
such species as I have observed in confinement. It is the 
same with the Molliisca tunicata. The branchial sac is 
muscular, and just as its capacity is enlarged, apparently by 
the contraction of its longitudinal fibres, the water flows in 
to fill the space in a slow and uniform current, through the 
branchial aperture only, for none can be detected entering by 
the anal orifice. It is, after a space, expelled again by a con- 
traction of the annular fibres of the sac, but the voluntary 
contractions for this purpose, as staled above, take place at 
irregular intervals of time, and, for the most part, not 
oftener than once in a minute. (Cuv'iqv, Maltus. Alem. xx. p. 17.; 
Coldstream, in Edin, New Phil. Juiini. for July, 1830, p. 240.) 
I have told you that the respiration of the Mollusca is at 
all times slow, and easily suspended for a long })eriod ; but, to 
obviate the inconveniences which might result from tliis, and 



1 08 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

to supply the place of that regularly alternate and ceaseless 
play of the respiratory muscles of the vertebrates, Dr. 
Sharpey has discovered that, in " the Mollusca, and other 
inferior tribes of aquatic animals, the external covering of the 
body generally, but especially of the respiratory organs, 
possesses the power of impelling the water contiguous to it 
in a determinate direction along tiie surface, by which means 
a constant current is kept up, and the blood exposed to the 
influence of successive portions of the surrounding element: 
this peculiar provision effecting, in those creatures, the same 
purpose as the respiratory muscles in the more perfect 
animals." These currents, in the Mollusca at least, and 
probably in all the animals in which they have been detected, 
are produced by the action of minute cilia, visible only with 
a glass, which are in constant motio*n, and clothe all the 
surfaces along which the currents are excited. Similar cilia 
had been observed on the eggs and organs of many zoophytes 
by previous naturalists, and in a few naked Mollusca, by 
Dr. Fleming; but the merit of proving their existence in 
all the great families of the Mollusca, with the exception of 
the Cephalopoda and the Tunicata, and of pointing out 
their use, is due to Dr. Sharpey. Carus came near the 
discovery ; for he observed the currents in question, but left 
uninvestigated their cause ; or, rather, he attributed the 
phenomena to one which has probably little efficiency^ His 
words are : — " In a living bivalve, it is easy to observe that 
the Wiiter gains access to the branchial laminae by the fissure 
in the cloak, and escapes by the anal tube, which serves also 
to evacuate excrement and ova. It has not, however, been 
hitherto noticed, that this current is uninterrupted, and that 
thus these animals, when not too deeply immersed, form an 
eddy on the surface of the water. But as, in almost all other 
animals, the influx of air or water to the respiratory organs 
is intermittent, the simultaneous and continuous current into 
the fissure of the cloak and out of its tube, of which I have 
satisfied myself by numerous observations, must depend on a 
very peculiar mechanism, which consists chiefly in the mus- 
cularity of the cloak, but partly also in the mobility of the 
gills themselves, and may be compared to the mechanism of 
certain bellows, which produce an uninterrupted current of 
air by means of double bags." {Comp. Anat., transl. vol. ii. 
p. 148.) 

As this discovery appears to me the most important which 
has been, made of late years in the physiology of these 
animals, you will permit me to trnnscribe, for your perusal, a 
paragrai)h of considerable length from Dr. Sharpey's Essay, 
with a view of giving some farther illustration of the process. 



their Bespiraiion. 109 

" When a live muscle (Mytilus edulis) is attentively examined 
in a vessel of sea water, it is soon observed to open its shell 
in a slio'ht degree, and about the same time a commotion 
may be perceived in the water in its vicinity. Ihis is occa- 
sioned by the water entering at the posterior or large ex- 
tremity of the animal, into the cavity in which the gills are 
lodged, and coming out, near the same place, by a separate 
orifice, in a continued stream. This current is obviously 
intended for the purpose of renewing the water required for 
the respiration and nutrition of the animal ; but, though it is 
now a well-established fact in the history of the muscle, the 
mechanism by which it is produced has not, so far as I know, 
been satisfactorily explained. Some have contented them- 
selves with ascribing it to an alternate opening and shutting 
of the shell ; but, as no such motion takes place in the shell, 
except at distant and irregular intervals, it is evident that the 
constant passage- of the water cannot be explained in this 
way. Others, who saw the insufficiency of this explanation, 
have endeavoured to account for it by assuming peculiar 
contractions and dilatations of the mantle in virtue of its 
muscular power, or, like M. de Blainvllle, have supposed 
that the triangular labial appendages placed round the mouth 
excited the current by their constant motion. After meeting 
with the currents in the tadpole, it struck me that the entrance 
and exit of the w^ater in the bivalve Mollusca might not 
improbably be owing to a similar cause; and that the surface 
of the respiratory organs, and other parts over which the 
water passed, might have the power of exciting currents in 
it, the combined effect of which would give rise to the entering 
and returning stream. 

*' This conjecture proved, on actual examination, to be 
right. Having cut off a portion of the gill, T found that a 
current was excited along its surface in a determinate di- 
rection, and that it moved itself through the water in an 
opposite one, exactly as in the case of the tadpole. The 
whole surface of th^ gills and labial appendages or accessory 
gills, the inner surliice of the cloak, and some other parts, 
produced this effect. The currents on the gills are of two 
kinds. When finely powdered charcoal is put on any part 
of their surface, a great portion of it soon disappears, liaving 
penetrated through the interstices of the vessels into the 
space between the two layers of the gill. On arriving liere, 
a part is forced out again at the base of the gill from under 
the border of the unattached layer, but most of it is con- 
veyed rapidly backwards- in the interior of the gill between 
the two layers, and almost immediately escapes at the ex- 



110 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

cretory orifice, or that from which the general current 
already mentioned is observed to come out. That portion 
of the powder which remains outside the gill is carried 
along its surface in straight lines from the base to the margin, 
along which it then advances onwards towards the fore part 
of the animal. As the spaces between the layers of all the 
gills terminate directly or indirectly at the excretory orifice, 
it is easily conceivable that the water, penetrating by the 
entire surface of these organs, may, by their concentrated 
effect, give rise to the powerful current which is observed to 
come out from the animal. 

" On examining a portion of the gills with a powerful 
lens, I perceived that it was beset with minute cilia, which 
are evidently instrumental in producing the different currents. 
Most of them are ranged along the anterior and posterior 
margin of each of the vessels composing the gills, in two 
sets : one nearer the surface, consisting of longer and more 
opaque cilia; the other close to the first, but a litde deeper, 
in which they are shorter and nearly transparent. Both sets 
are in constant motion, but of this it is difficult to convey a 
correct idea by description. The more opaque cilia, or those 
of the exterior range, appear and disappear by turns, as if 
they either were alternately pushed out and retracted, or 
were continually changing from a horizontal to a vertical 
direction. The motion of the other set appears to consist 
in a succession of undulations, which proceed in a uniform 
manner along the margin of the vessel from one end to the 
other. It resembles a good deal the apparent progression 
of the turns of a spiral when it revolves on its axis, and 
might very easily be mistaken for the circulation of a fluid in 
the interior of a canal, more particularly as the course of the 
undulations is different on the two edges of the vessel, being 
directed on the one towards the margin of the gill, and on 
the other towards the base. But, besides that the undu- 
lations continue to go on for some time in small pieces cut 
off from the gill, which is inconsistent with the progression 
of a fluid in a canal, the cilia are easily distinguished when 
the undulatory motion has become languid. When it has 
entirely stopped, they remain in contact with each other, so 
as to present the appearance of a membrane attached to the 
edge of the vessel. 

" It is very remarkable, that, when the gill is immersed in 
fresh water, both the currents and the motion of the cilia are 
almost instantaneously stopped." *

their Respiration* 1 1 1 

The purpose of the respiratory organs, and of the currents 
just described, is, to expose the blood freely to the purificative 
action of the atmospherical air, that it may be purged of 
some noxious qualities which it has acquired during its 
circulation through the venous system, and fitted again for 
the continuance of the life of the individual. In the ver- 
tebrate animals the blood is altered, even in its outward ap- 
pearance, by this process ; from a dark it becomes a bright 
red fluid: but no perceptible change is operated on the white 
serous blood of the Mollusca, yet that it has experienced a 
similar purification is not to be doubted ; for the air breathed 
by these creatures is similarly deteriorated, as it would have 
been had it been breathed by the quadruped or bird ; the 
oxygen has disappeared, and its place become occupied by 
an equal btdk of carbonic acid gas. This had been proved 
by the well known experiments of Spallanzani and other 
physiologists ; and though, in general, the proportion holds 
good, yet it appears, from the recent experiments of Tre- 
viranus, that the absorption of oxygen is not alwa7/s pro- 
portional to the excretion of carbonic acid, the proportion 
of the one to the other depending on the strength of the 
respiration, the time of its continuance while the respir- 
ability of the air is diminishing, and the volume of the air 
in which the respiration is performed. " The more car- 
bonic acid," says Treviranus, " there is developed while 
breathing in the open air, and the less the power of con- 
tinuing in a medium deficient in ox^^gen, the less is the 
proportion of the consumption of oxygen to the production 
of carbonic acid gas, whence a small quantity of atmospheric 
air is respired for a moderate period. But when the re- 
spiration is continued for a longer period in the same air, 
and the strength of the individual begins to sink, the excre- 
tion of the latter diminishes more rapidly than the absorption 
of the former. We know that the higher classes of animals, 
when enclosed in a certain quantity of air, die long before all 
its oxygen has been exhausted. The case is very different 
with many of the Mollusca under the same circumstances; 
for they not only consume all the oxygen, but actually con- 
tinue afterwards to exspire carbonic acid gas : consequently, 
after the respiration has been continued for some time, there 
has been more of the latter excreted than there has been con- 
sumed of the former; nay, sometimes this occurs even before 
all the oxygen has been consumed." {E(Ii?i. New PhiLJoiirn., 
April, 1833, p. 383.*) These observations may serve to 

* The Rev. Mr. Guilding has conjectured tiiat some Mollusca may even 
purify water : — " iS^'eritinae are destroyed with great difficulty : some, 



112 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

explain, in some degree, the apparent apathy of the MolMsca 
generally to a temporary deprivation of their respiratory 
media : for snails may be immersed in water for many hours 
without injury; and the purely aquatic species will survive as 
long a time exposed to the atmosphere. Oysters and muscles, 
as every one knows, and probably all the Conchifera, will 
live for three or four days without any more water to breathe 
in than what may lie in the concavity of their shells ; and 
Mr. Boyle has some experiments which illustrate, in a remark- 
able manner, their tenacity of life even in vacuum. He found 
that two oysters, put " into a very small receiver," exhausted 
of air, were alive at the end of twenty-four hours ; " but how 
long afterwards they continued so, I did not observe." {Phil. 
Trans., 1670, p. 2023.) Another oyster was put into a vial 
full of water before being enclosed in the receiver, " that, 
through the liquor, the motion of the (air) bubbles, expected 
from the fish, might be more pleasantly seen and considered. 
This oyster proved so strong, as to keep itself close shut, and 
repressed the eruption of the bubbles, that in the other did 
force open the shells from time to time; and kept in its own 
air as long as we had occasion to continue the trials." {Ibid., 
p. 2024.) Shelled snails (Helices) appeared to be not more 
disordered in vacuity ; and even the slugs (Z^imax) endured 
the privation for many hours. The same illustrious philo- 
sopher included two of the latter " in a small portable 
receiver," carefully exhausted ; " but, though they did not 
lose their motion near so soon as other animals were in 
our vacuum wont to do, yet, coming to look on them after 
some hours, they appeared moveless and very tumid; and, at 
the end of twelve hours, the inward parts of their bodies 
seemed to be almost vanished, and they seemed to be but a 
couple of small full-blown bladders ; and, on the letting in of 
the air, they immediately so shrunk, as if the bladders had 
been pricked : the receding air had left behind it nothing but 
skins ; nor did either of the snails afterwards, though kept 
many hours, give any signs of life." {Ibid., p. 2050.) In tljis 
experiment, it is obvious that the snails were killed from the 
mechanical effects of the expansion of the air within them, 
and not from its ingress to the pulmonary cavity being 
prevented. 



which were even kept close in salt water, seemed to have the power of 
purifying it, and rendering it fit for respiration ; while many large air- 
bubbles were generated in the glass. Some power of this kind would be 
very valuable to those species which inhabit maritime ponds, the waters of 
which, nearly dried up at certain seasons, must be stagnant and unwhole- 
some." (Zoological Journaly vol. v. p. 33.) 



their Respiratioju 113 

But there are on record some extraordinary facts, which 
seem to prove that, under certain conditions, all of which are 
not yet known, the respiration of many Mollusca, more espe- 
cially the terrestrial, may be suspended for an indefinite period, 
and again renewed by the application of heat and moisture ; 
life, as it were, keeping watch, and iiolding at bay every 
destructive agent, but without giving any outward sign of her 
presence and constant wakefulness, until the return of those 
influences in which she joys. " All the land Testacea," to 
use the words of Dr. Fleming, " appear to have the power 
of becoming torpid at pleasure, and independent of any alter- 
ations of temperature. Thus, even in midsummer, if we 
place in a box specimens of the Helix hortensis, nemoralis, 
or arbustorum, without food, in a day or two they form for 
themselves a thin operculum, attach themselves to the side of 
the box, and remain in this dormant state. They may be 
kept in this condition for several years. No ordinary change 
of temperature produces any effect upon them, but they 
speedily revive- if plunged in water. Even in their natural 
haunts, they are often found in this state during the summer 
season, when there is a continued drought. With the first 
shower, however, they recover, and move about ; and at this 
time the conchologist ought to be on the alert." {Phil. ZooL, 
vol. ii. p. 77.) 1 may illustrate these remarks, which are per- 
fectly correct, by some additional examples; one or two of 
which you may find to require an exercise of faith for which 
you may not be altogether prepared. Mr. Lyell tells us that 
" four individuals of a large species of Biilimus, from Val- 
paraiso, were brought to England by Lieutenant Graves, who 
accompanied Captain King in his late expedition to the Straits 
of Magellan. They had been packed up in a box, and en- 
veloped in cotton, two for a space of thirteen, one for seven- 
teen, and a fourth for upwards of twenty months ; but, on 
being exposed, by Mr. Broderip, to the warmth of a fire in 
London, and provided with tepid water and leaves, they re- 
vived, and are now living in Mr. Loddiges's palm-house.'* 
{Princ. Geol.^ vol. ii. p. 109.) Dr. Elliotson put a garden snail 
" into a dry closet, without food, a year and a half ago : it 
became torpid, and has remained so ever since, except when- 
ever I have chosen to moisten it. A few drops of water revive 
it at any time." (Blumenbach's Physiology^ p. 182.) Similar 
instances may be found in some of the periodical journals ; 
but they are as nothing when compared with the snails of 
Mr. Stuckey Simon, a merchant of Dublin, which, on being 
immersed in water, recovered and crept about after an uninter-

rupted torpidity of at least fifteen years*; and I agree with 
Mr. Bingley in thinking that this is a well-authenticated fact. 
Whether what follows is so, I leave to your own decision ; but 
I will not say you are unreasonably sceptical if you deem it 
too tramontane. " Professor Eaton of New York stated," 
says my authority, " that the diluvial deposits through which 
the Erie Canal was made contained ridges of hard compact 
gravel. On cutting through one of these, near Rome village, 

* " Mr. Stuckej^ Simon, a merchant of Dublin, whose father, a fellow 
of the Royal Society, and a lover of natural history, left to him a small 
collection of fossils and other curiosities, had among them the shells of 
some snails. About fifteen years after his father's death (in whose pos- 
session they continued many years), he by chance gave to his son, a child 
about ten years old, some of these snail shells to play with. The boy put 
them into a flower-pot, which he filled with water, and the next day into 
a basin. Having occasion to use this, Mr. Simon observed that the 
animals had come out of their shells. He examined the child, who assured 
him that they were the same he had given him, and said he had also a few 
more, which he brought. Mr. Simon put one of these into water, and in 
an hour and a half after observed that it had put out its horns and body, 
which it moved but slowly, probably from weakness. Major Vallancey and 
Dr. Span were afterwards present, and saw one of the snails crawl out, 
the others being dead, most probably from their having remained some days 
in the water. Dr. Quin and Dr. Rutty also examined the living snail several 
different times, and were greatly pleased to see him come out of his solitary 
habitation after so many years' confinement. Dr. Macbride, and a party 
of gentlemen at his house, were also witnesses of this surprising phe- 
nomenon. Dr. Macbride has thus mentioned the circumstance: — ' After 
the shell had lain about ten minutes in a glass of water that had the cold 
barely taken off, the snail began to appear, and in five minutes more we 
perceived half the body pushed out from the cavity of the shell. We then 
removed it into a basin, that the snail might have more scope than it had 
in the glass ; and here, in a very short time, we saw it get above the sur- 
face of the water, and crawl up towards the edge of the basin. While it was 
thus moving about, with its horns erect, a fly chanced to be hovering near, 
and, perceiving the snail, darted down upon it. The little animal instantly 
withdrew itself into the shell, but as quickly came forth again when it 
found the enemy was gone off. We allowed it to wander about the basin 
for upwards of an hour, when we returned it into a wide-mouthed phial, 
wherein Mr. Simon had lately been used to keep it. He was so obliging 
as to present me with this remarkable shell ; and I observed, at twelve 
o'clock, as I was going to bed, that the snail was still in motion ; but next 
morning I found it in a torpid state, sticking to the side of the glass.' 

*' A few weeks afterwards the shell was sent to Sir John Pringle, who 
showed it at a meeting of the Royal Society; but some of the members 
imagining that Mr. Simon must have been imposed upon by his son having 
substituted fresh shells for those that had been given to him, the boy was 
reexamined by Dr. Macbride on the subject, who declared that he could 
find no reason to believe that the child either did or could impose upon 
his father. Mr. Simon's living in the heart of the city rendered it almost 
impossible for the boy (if he had been so disposed) to collect fresh shells, 
being at that time confined to the house with a cold. Mr. Simon has also 
declared that he is positive those were the shells he gave to him, having in 
his cabinet many more of the same sort, and nearly of the same size."

16 miles west of Utica, the workmen found several hundred 
of live molluscous animals. They were chiefly of the ikfya 
cariosa and Mya purpi^rea. Tiie workmen took the animals, 
fried, and ate them. He adds, ' I was assured that they were 
taken alive ^^ft. deep in the deposit. Several of the shells 
are now before me. The deposit is diluvial. These animals 
must have been there from the time of the deluge, for the 
earth in which they were is too compact for them to have been 
produced by a succession of generations. These freshwater 
clams of 3000 years old precisely resemble the same species 
which now inhabit the fresh waters of that district ; therefore, 
the lives of these animals have been greatly prolonged by 
their exclusion from air and light for more than 3000 years." 
(Silliman's Amer, Journal^ No. xv. p. 249., as quoted in Tur- 
ner's Sacred History^ p. 473.) 

With the exception of the last example, the others refer to 
land Testacea ; but some pulmoniferous aquatic species are 
equally capable of assuming this state of torpidity, when under 
circumstances which deprive them of their respiratory medium. 
In early spring, I have more than once observed the Limneus 
fossarius to abound in small pools of water, which were dried 
up as the season advanced ; and when, after a careful search, 
the little snails were found, in a torpid condition, concealed 
in the cracks made by the drought, or under small clods of 
earth, where they awaited a happier season to refill their pools, 
and permit them to resume the functions of active life. Per- 
haps, in this country, their torpidity can rarely be continued 
beyond a few weeks ; but, in tropical climes, similar species 
can pass the dry season of five long months in this state. 
Thus, Adanson informs us that the minute freshwater shell, 
which he calls Bulimus, is to be seen only from the month of 
September to January, in the marshes of Senegal, formed by 
the rains which fall in June, July, August, and September. 
When these marshes are dried up, and, as it were, roasted by 
the sun, the shellfish disappear; a few empty shells alone 
being left, to show where they had been ; but they never fail 
to return with the rainy season ; and Adanson remarked that, 
the hotter the preceding summer, the more abundant was the 
issue of the succeeding hordes. How, asks the author, shall 
we explain this marvellous reproduction? Can the eggs of 
the animal, necessarily very delicate and minute; cao they 
remain in a soil so burned up, without being entirely dried; or 
can the animals themselves, if it is true that they conceal 
themselves in the bosom of the earth, can they resist, during 
five or six months, the heat of a burning sun ? (Hist. Nat, 

I 2 



1 1 6 Natural History of Molluscous Anhials : — 

du Senegal, p. 7.) The latter supposition is the only one 
which can, I think, solve the question. 

When in this torpid state, the condition of the snail itself 
has not been ascertained. Some authors speak of it as being 
dormant; and the language would seem to imply that they 
consider it in a state of sleep, in which the circulation and re- 
spiration go on uninterruptedly and as strongly as when awake ; 
but I suspect that the authors alluded to never intended that 
such an inference should be drawn from their analogical lan- 
guage. The fact is, it is not known precisely whether the 
circulation goes on or is stopped, or whether the contact of air 
is essential or otherwise. It is difficult to believe that all the 
functions as well as the signs of life cease entirely ; and yet 
it is scarcely less so to suppose that, for the space of fifteen 
years or more, those functions could exist without some supply 
of food to keep up the waste and secretions, however trivial, 
which necessarily flow from a circulation, or without some air 
to purify the circulating fluid.* 

If I deem it necessary to distinguish torpidity from sleep, 
it is, perhaps, not less so to distinguish it from the state of 
hybernation, although the phenomena of both are more 
strictly analogous. Snails become torpid when the atmosphere 
is hot and dry ; and, as often as they are unbound by the 
application of a warm moisture, they come forth from the 
shell strong and vigorous ; but, " intelligent of seasons," 
they begin instinctively to seek hybernating quarters at a 
moist season of the year, and before the cold has benumbed 
their powers ; and, if roused ultimately, their languid move- 
ments evidence their weakness, and bespeak our sympathy to 
leave them to repose. Whether the vital functions in these 
creatures are similarly afi'ected during torpor and hybernation 
remains to be determined. It is probable that they are. 

In this country, and in others with similar climates, pro- 
bably all the terrestrial shelled snails, and all the pulmoniferous 
freshwater Mollusca, pass the winter in a state of hybernation. 
I believe that the naked slugs do not hybernate ; for, although 
they retire under stones, clods of earth, or moss, to protect 

* " This living principle has the singular property of remaining dormant 
and inert for years or ages ; without, therefore, ceasing to exist. We all 
know that seeds may be kept a long while unsown, and yet grow whenever 
planted in a suitable soil . This, again, is like animals which have been 
found enclosed in trees, and yet have revived. When plants are buried in 
the ground to a greater depth than is natural to them for their proper 
growth, they do not vegetate; but they do not therefore die: they retain 
their power of vegetation to an unlimited period ; and when, by any acci- 
dent, brought so near the surface as to suit their evolution, they begin 
immediately to grow." (Turner's Sacred Ilistori/, p. 195.)

themselves from the cold and storms of the season, yet I have 
always found them immediately to resume their activity when 
taken from their concealments, and they are in motion all the 
winter in mild weather. It is not certainly known, although 
the contrary has been asserted *, that any marine Molluscum 
hybernates. There would seem to be no necessity that the 
snails of tropical countries should be endowed with this 
remarkable property ; but the observations of Adanson prove 
the contrary. He tells us that the BMimus Kambeul appa- 
rently passes the winter, or dry season, i?i a deep slumber, like 
the S7iails of Europe ; for he found several of them which were 
half-buried, in the month of September, at the roots of trees 
and in the thickest brushwoods ; and of these some had 
already closed the aperture of their shell very exactly with a 
lid of a whitish and plaster-like matter, to protect themselves 
against the long droughts which continue for eight or nine 
months uninterruptedly. [Hist. Nat. du Senegal, p. 18.) 

None of the hybernating Mollusca exhibit any remarkable 
cunning in the selection of their hybernacula or winter quar- 
ters. On the approach of the cold weather, the terrestrial 
tribes seek out a convenient station in crevices of old walls, at 
the roots of coarse grass, or in tufts of moss, and, retiring 
within the shell, they close up its aperture by a membranous 
or calcareous epiphragm, which serves, at the same time, to 
fix or cement the shell to the wall or body against which it 
rests. At the same period, the aquatic tribes descend to the 
bottom of their ponds and ditches, sink a little in the soft 
mud, and cover over the mouth of the shell with a transparent 
gelatine. In general, when the temperature of the air sinks 
below the 50th degree of Fahrenheit, cold-blooded animals 
begin their winter slumber, and, previously prepared by that 
instinct which operates as wisely as if right reason had fore- 
seen the coming evil, they gradually, with the increasing 
cold, sink into a state which resembles more the stillness of 
death than the quietness of sleep ; a state without motion, or 
feeling, or sense, or heat, and in which the heart and lungs, 
the vital organs, perform their functions more and more feebly, 
until they also rest still in the general quiescence ; and in this 
deathlike condition these animals continue " for five, six, 
seven, or even eight or nine months, according to the climate 
and season," until the genial warmth and dews of spring 
recall them anew to life and action.

118 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

account of the hybernation of Helix pomatia, in the first 
volume of the Zoological Jourmal ; to which I must refer you 
for the particulars. This species forms, by aid of its foot and 
a very glutinous secretion, an excavation or nest, in which it 
buries the shell, and it then closes the aperture with a thick 
calcareous epiphragm, and with several interior membranous 
partitions, which are more numerous at the end than at the 
beginning of winter, and in the snails inhabiting the moun- 
tains than in those found on low ground. Thus buried and 
enclosed, it passes six months in a state of total torpidity ; 
for the only indication of irritability perceptible during this 
period is a slight contraction of the collar of the mantle when 
touched, on removing the epiphragm. He found that there 
was no digestion ; the heart at first beat feebly, and with a 
very slow pulsation; but at a later period it was found to 
have stopped, and the circulation was entirely suspended; 
respiration ceased ; no animal heat, which even in the sum- 
mer, when respiration and circulation are most lively, does 
not exceed one degree above the surrounding atmosphere, 
was evolved ; no secretions nor wasting function went on, 
neither any growth or reproduction of new parts. " In our 
climate, it is about the beginning of April, soon after the song 
of the cuckoo begins and the swallows appear, that the snails 
leave their torpid state; varying a little, however, according 
to the season. The mode by which their escape from con- 
finement is effected is simple and easily comprehended. The 
air which is contained in the different cells, and which had 
been expired on the animal withdrawing itself farther and 
farther into the shell after the formation of the operculum, is 
again inspired, and each separate membranous partition 
broken by the pressure of the hinder part of the foot pro- 
jected through the mantle. When it arrives at the calcareous 
operculum, the animal, making a last effort, bursts and detaches 
its most obtuse angle. Then insinuating by little and little 
the edge of the foot between the shell and the operculum, it 
forces the latter off, or breaks it away. The animal then 
comes forth, walks, and immediately begins feeding, with an 
appetite excited, doubtless, by an abstinence of six or seven 
months." (p. 99.) 

Such is M. Gaspard's account of the reviviscency of Helix 
pomatia, and the process must be still simpler in the other 
species ; for they have merely to rupture a single horny or 
semigelatinous membrane. But there has been a difference 
of opinion relative to the source of the air which is first 
respired. Gaspard, you will observe, says that that portion 
which is confined between the layers of the epiphragms is 



their Eespiratmi. 119 

the first inhaled ; and, in coincidence with this opinion, we 
must infer that the species with a single membrane respire in 
the first instance the air behind it, and then, by their own 
efforts, burst their prison wall. A very different explanation 
of the process has been advanced by Sir Everard Home. He 
says : — " When warmth and moisture are applied, the mem- 
branous film (of tlie garden snail) falls off; a globule of air 
that remained in the cavity of the lungs becomes rarefied, and 
forces its way out, and admits of fresh air being applied to 
these organs."* (^Comp, Anat., vol. iii. p. 156.) I suspect that 
more of fancy than of observation enters into the baronet's 
theory; for were the rarefaction of the contained air, and its 
egress through the pulmonary aperture, all that was neces- 
sary to shake off the winter slumber, this would be done on 
several days in winter and in early spring, when the sun 
shines brightly and the atmospherical temperature is high 
enough to produce the effect, often higher, indeed, than it 
is when they begin, in the appointed time, to leave their 
hybernating retreats. If, says M. Gaspard, individuals of 
Helix pomatia " were exposed during the winter to a dry 
heat of from 60° to 100° for several days, or even weeks, 
not one made its appearance; whilst, on the contrary, those 
which were placed in a deep recess, the regular temperature 
of which was 50°, came forth in April, or at the beginning of 
May, without any increase of temperature." 

Dr. Turton, on the other hand, maintains that the doctrine 
of Gaspard is equally untenable ; for that the direct commu- 
nication between the external air and the animal within its 
shell is never interrupted, but on the contrary preserved, by 
means of a small aperture in the epiphragm. His words 
are : — " But, upon examination, it will appear, that in the 

* In the following extract Sir E. Home repeats his hypothesis in a more 
detailed manner : — " It is curious that, although respiration is necessary 
for carrying on the functions of life, it is by no means so for the con- 
tinuance of its existence. The garden snail illustrates this fact in the most 
satisfactory manner. When the temperature of the atmosphere sinks 
below a certain degree, this animal places itself upon a solid body, that it 
may not be liable to fall off": it then forms an operculum of mucus, by 
which respiration is stopped, and the animal remains hermetically sealed 
up till warmth and moisture dissolve the mucus by which the animal was 
fixed to its place ; and a globule of air retained in the lungs, which consist 
only of one cell or bag, being rarefied, escapes externally, restoring the 
communication with the air of the atmosphere which rushes in, and the 
action of the heart is renewed. If it is admitted that the application of 
oxygen to the muscles of the heart is capable of stimulating that organ, 
nothing can be more simple than the mode in which this in effected : the 
oxygen of the atmosphere is absorbed by the blood in the lungs, and tho 
closeness of the ventricle of the heart to the lungs permits the oxygen to 
penetrate to the heart." (Comp, Anat.y vol. v. [). 129.)

centre of this epiphragm (of Helix pomatia) is an exceedingly 
minute orifice, communicating with an umbilical cord, which 
is connected with a fine placenta-Hke tissue of vessels, pene- 
trating into the pulmonary cavity itself; and this minute ori- 
fice, although not large enough to admit a drop of water, is 
of sufficient capacity for the passage of that quantity of oxy- 
genated air necessary for the purposes of extremely slow, but 
not totally extinct, respiration. If this orifice be covered 
over with a coat of wax or varnish, so that all possible con- 
nection with external air be excluded, animal life becomes 
altogether extinguished, never to be again restored. We have 
observed this minute puncture in the winter covering of the 
H. ericetorum and some others ; and it is probable that all 
whose aperture is closed during the cold season only, are fur- 
nished with this beautiful apparatus for the preservation of 
life." {Manual of Land and Freshisoater Shells, p. 46.) I re- 
commend you to examine into those very interesting state- 
ments ; and, if your own observations confirm them, they will 
materially alter some inferences which have been drawn from 
Gaspard's experiments, and adopted by us, in reference to 
the total cessation of the action of the lungs and heart. That 
snail does not reach this northern latitude; but I have exa- 
mined, too carelessly however, the epiphragm of Helix aspersa 
during its hybernation, and always find a small aperture in 
it ; and also, in the aquatic tribes, I find a larger hole in their 
thin winter operculum, intended, assuredly, to keep up the 
communication between the pulmonary cavity and circum- 
ambient medium in their season of repose. 

There is something admirable in this curious adaptation of 
the economy of the hybernating creatures to their situations ; 
for otherwise they could not live beyond a single summer in 
the countries which they now inhabit with impunity to them- 
selves. If, during their active state of existence, you were to 
keep a Limneus, or any other aquatic pulmoniferous species, 
immersed in water for only one short day, it would die irre- 
coverably; but it remains under water, perhaps with the 
surface frozen over, for three or four months uninjured, when 
the system has been prepared, in autumn, for the change. 
And so of the land kinds : they perish if deprived of air for a 
few hours only in summer, or if exposed to an artificial cold 
not lower than the cold of winter ; but in a state of hyberna- 
tion they respire, if any, such a small quantity of air as is not 
to be appreciated, and brave our longest and severest frosts 
without peril and without pain. ** O Lord, how glorious are 
thy works ! thy thoughts are very deep ! "

The most advantageous occupation for man is the study of 
the works of his Creator ; this study is also the most natural, 
and consequently the most gratifying. Man delights to en- 
quire into the means employed to accomplish appointed ends; 
he possesses an innate desire to discover the causes of those ob- 
vious phenomena which are continually attracting his attention. 
It is but too frequently the aim of those who instruct youth 
to repress this desire, this thirst for natural knowledge, sup- 
posing it likely, if encouraged, to interfere, in after-life, with 
the pursuit of power and riches, which are generally the only 
desiderata held up to our youthful hopes. It should be far 
otherwise; the expanding mind, like the growing body, 
should be copiously supplied with wholesome nutriment, else 
its tastes become vitiated and its power weakened. There is 
nothing which enables an ardent and aspiring mind to form 
so just an estimate of itself, as does an idea, however imper- 
fect, of something greatly superior. Now, that mind must be 
lost to the power of thinking, that cannot trace in the circu- 
lation of the blood, in the conversion of an egg to a chicken, 
or in the reproduction of a spider's leg or a lobster's claw, 
the design and superintendence of an intelligence infinitely 
above its own. Let man enquire into these things. As he 
imbibes great and important truths in natural history, he be- 
comes deeply imbued with a sense of his own insignificance. 
His first safe step in knowledge is the assured feeling of his 
own utter ignorance. 

I have long desired the opportunity now afforded me, of 
addressing readers among whom many will be willing to 
consider themselves learners. For the learned I have no no- 
velties in store. I address myself more particularly to those 
yet in the morning of life, whose enthusiasm of enquiry has 
received no chill from the unsatisfactory sophisms and pe- 
dantry of some of the self-elected dictators in natural history. 
I am no dictator, but a fellow enquirer : my solicitation is, 
'* Come with me, a lowly and unworthy son of science ; come 
with me, and let us together meditate on the wonderful works 
of our Creator. Let us examine together the structure of

liarities which distinguish it from the other branches. Let 
us see how beautifully these very peculiarities are ada})ted to 
the parts in the creation which these creatures are designed 
to perform." 



122 Relations of the Structure of 

In this research, Professor Grant, in his admirable lectures 
at the London University, and Mr. Newman, in his letters on 
the Osteology of Insects, in the Entomological Magazine^ have 
both preceded me; but, by restricting myself to much narrower 
limits than the former, and avoiding altogether the tech- 
nicalities of the latter, I trust it will not be difficult to steer a 
middle course, without the least interference with either of 
them. 

Animals are termed annulate, from having the exterior of 
their bodies divided into rings. The name may be considered 
as applicable to every creature commonly known as an insect; 
flies, bees, wasps, beetles, grasshoppers, dragon-flies, moths, 
butterflies, fleas, mites, spiders, centipedes, scorpions, lob- 
sters, crabs, shrimps, &c., &c. 

In these creatures we find the seven principal systems of 
organs observable in larger animals and in man : the organs 
of sensation, or nervous system; the organs of support, os- 
seous or bony system ; the organs of motion, or muscular 
system; and these three we shall find, throughout their varied 
developement, peculiarly connected and dependent on each 
other : the organs of circulation, or vascular system ; the 
organs of respiration, or respiratory system ; these two, also, 
being dependent on each other : the organs of nutrition, or 
digestive system; and the organs of reproduction, or generative 
system. 

We frequently find, in the writings of men entitled to the 
greatest respect, a kind of triple division made of the organs 
of sensation — the brain, the nerves, and the organs of the 
senses. Let us examine whether this division really exists. 
Vegetable physiologists have shown that the delicate flowers 
of a plant are but the perfected continuation and completion 
of the same rind which originates in the root and clothes the 
stem. Now, it appears to me, that the nerves originate in 
the brain, which is their root, branch through the body, and 
blossom in the organs of the senses ; and that, therefore, each 
peculiar character they assume is but the modification of the 
same system. Taste, smell, hearing, and sight must, in this 
case, be considered as nothing more than variously perfected 
attenuations of the same nerves which are distributed through- 
out the body ; in other words, varied developements of the 
power of feeling, wonderfully contrived to arrest, ascertain, 
and apply the properties of substances, effluvia, sounds, and 
rays of light. The nerves, when terminating simply in organs 
of sensation, appear to be endowed with a double capacity : 
they convey the impression of the presence and form of inert 



Annulate Animals to their Economy. 123 

matter, and of pain from the quality or motion of matter. 
One impression is not the excess of the other ; the scald of 
hot water, or the entrance of a bullet, conveys no impression 
of form. We find that, the more concentrated the brain, as 
in vertebrates, the more perfect are the organs of the senses. 
Let us select, for example, a mouse : mark the bright eyes, the 
attentive ears, the inquisitive nose, all taking instant cogni- 
zance of danger, or enquiring for means of support. Ex- 
quisitely slender, infinitely ramified, and tremblingly alive to 
pain, are the nerves which serve for the sense of touch. Of 
vertebrated animals, moreover, it is a distinguishing character 
that the separation of the brain from its branches, the nerves, 
causes death. 

In annulates, the nerves are nowhere concentrated into a 
mass analogous to the brain of man, but are gathered up into 
knotted strings, two principal series of which pass longitu- 
dinally throughout the body, extending their branches into 
all the limbs. The head, in such a formation, is therefore no 
longer the seat of life, or essential to life, but every segment 
and every limb is possessed of, and retains, vitality in equal 
proportion. This diffused brain, like the concentrated human 
brain, appears to be the organ governing sensation, and, like 
that, also, seems, in its principal masses, without sensation in 
its own self; and its radiations do not, except as organs of 
the senses, generally, as in vertebrates, find their way to the 
surface. From these circumstances it may be conjectured, 
that, had we the means of ascertaining, we should find that 
annulates are altogether without that acute sense of pain 
which we possess. The organs of the senses, also, are less 
perfectly developed. If we select the lobster as an example 
of a large and tolerably perfect annulate, and examine its 
dull eyes, its simple vestibules of ears, we shall instantly be 
struck with its inferiority in these respects. Another result 
of this difference in organisation is, that creatures having the 
concentrated brain enjoy, in a greater or less degree, that 
wonderful reflecting meditating power possessed in so glorious 
a degree by man ; whilst the whole of the annulates are di- 
rected in all their actions by a blind unreasoning instinct. 
The annulates, then, may be said to be unprotected by reflec- 
tion, and for the most part unguarded by the senses. The 
lobster is driven by the waves and dashed among the roughest 
rocks ; the heedless beetle flies in our very faces ; myriads of 
insects are forcibly impelled by the winds against the hardest 
substances ; myriads are beaten to the earth by rain ; myriads 
are cast, unresisting, into rivers and lakes. Yet they escape 



124 Belations of the Structure of 

from all this unharmed, and, by a simple and beautiful con- 
trivance, are enabled to abide their time, to exist till their 
destiny is complete. They are provided with an exterior 
skeleton, a covering which wraps them as a mantle and shields 
them from harm. 

The covering of annulates is completely bony; it is, in 
every respect, a substitute for the internal skeleton of verte- 
brates : like that, it serves for the attachment of the muscles 
and support of the whole frame. It bears uninjured the con- 
tact of the roughest and hardest substances. It enables its 
possessor to endure that rough usage which the more perfect 
developement of the organs of the senses in vertebrates en- 
ables them to avoid. When we consider the destiny of annu- 
lates, principally food for each other, or for larger animals, 
we cannot wonder that the same nicety of reasoning power 
and of sensation, which vertebrates enjoy, has not been given 
them. To what good purpose would it have tended, had 
nature furnished creatures so obviously the sport of wind and 
wave, so obviously liable to continual loss of limb, so ob- 
viously designed the living food of others, with that constant 
apprehension of danger, and that acute sensation of injury, 
which we ourselves possess? Certainly to none. Their 
brain does not reason, their covering does not feel. This 
bony covering or skeleton of annulates gives them shape, and, 
like the skeleton of vertebrates, affords the naturalist some of 
the best characters for distributing them into groups. It is 
transversely divided into thirteen segments, or rings ; whence 
the term annutate. To each of these rings names have been 
lately given by Mr. Newman, in the work before alluded to, 
the Entomological Magazirie. Attached to these rings are 
the organs of locomotion ; and the number, position, and de- 
velopement of these are very various ; and a knowledge of 
these variations is, consequently, not (mly highly interesting, 
but absolutely essential to the right understanding of the 
economy and classification of these wonderful creatures. 

The muscles, in annulates, are very various in their pro- 
portions ; we shall, however, always find them beautifully 
adapted to the labour they have to perform ; and their degree 
of developement operates immediately on that part of the 
skeleton which covers them, by a visible increase or decrease 
in size of the bony plates of which each segment is composed. 
It not unfrequently happens in glowworms, moths, &Ce, that, 
in the same species, one sex is provided with wings and the 
other sex wants them entirely : in these cases we find that, in 
the females, there is a tendency to equal developement of all 



Annulate Animals to their Econcnny, 1 25 

the segments; whilst, m the males, the wing-bearing segments 
are both increased in magnitude and altered in form. By 
dissection we find that those muscles which, in the males, are 
essential to move and guide, with great power and rapidity, 
the organs of flight, are become obsolete, or rather repose in a 
quiescent and undeveloped state, in the inactive females, 
which are doomed never to traverse the realms of air. Ob- 
serve, again, the common ant. Compare, in a winged ant, 
the wing-bearing segments with the same parts in a worker 
which is constantly without wings, and you cannot fail to 
be struck with the difference in their size. In autumn, 
large wingless ants are not uncommonly seen with the wing- 
bearing segments precisely similar to that of the winged ants: 
these are females which have once possessed wings, but 
which have, on settling down to form a new colony, stripped 
off these organs as useless in the subterranean life they are 
about to lead. 

We must, however, in making a law for the appropriation 
of muscular developement to the extent, strength, or activity 
of the organs it has to govern, be ever on the watch for the 
operation of yet more positive and unvarying laws, which 
may supersede the operation of the one we may assume. 
Specific gravity is one of these. The lobster, which is so 
nearly equal in weight to its own bulk of salt water that it 
floats in it with perfect ease, can, in that medium, move its 
ponderous claws with the greatest activity ; but in the air, 
unless the governing muscles, and consequently that portion 
of the body which they occupy, were increased at least ten- 
fold in magnitude, these claws would be unwieldy and useless. 
If we hold a lobster up by the back, we find that these claws 
are too heavy to be employed : the forceps will pinch, and 
that severely, but the object must be placed purposely in 
their way. the animal possessing no muscles which will raise 
them sufficiently to seize an object on a level with its head. 
Still we must not conclude that the annulates inhabiting 
water are invariably thus unfitted for exertion in another 
medium; for this is by no means the case; many possess a 
form and organs equally adapted for living in the water or on 
the land.

This splendid worm was first discovered by Colonel Mon- 
tagu ; and although it has been since noticed by several con- 
chologists, yet as none of them, except Mr. Berkeley, has 
taken any notice of the animal, it may not be deemed an un- 
interesting subject for these illustrations, particularly as the 
figure alluded to is contained in an expensive work, in the 
hands, perhaps, of few readers of this Magazine; and the 
figure itself I was never able to procure. 

Serpula tubularia is the largest species of its genus found 




Serpula Uthuldria. 127 

on our coasts, and has been usually considered among the 
rarest. The shell is from four to five inches long, and some- 
times more, but the animal tenant does not exceed three. The 
body of this is vermiform, flattish, distinctly annulated, of a 
reddish-orange colour, stained with irregular blotches, from 
the opacity of the viscera and their contents. The anterior 
extremity is obtusely truncate, and on it are placed two large 
fan-shaped bundles of filaments of a yellowish colour, beauti- 
fully marked with scarlet spots. The filaments in each bundle 
are numerous, and are united at the base into a fleshy stalk, 
which again is directly connected with the head, on which 
also some scarlet spots are distributed. Each filament is 
simple, but pectinated along the internal edge with a close 
series of short blunt processes, which are not visible without 
the aid of the magnifier. The anterior third of the body is 
covered with a thin brown membrane, divided on the ventral 
aspect, where the margins are free and somewhat undulated ; 
they are also furnished on each side with seven little brushes of 
bristles, which appear to be partly retractile. These brushes 
are placed at equal distances ; the anterior, perhaps, a little 
closer; and at the side of each there is a scarlet bar or spot ; the 
bristles in each are very slender, numerous, yellowish, smooth, 
and acutely pointed. The remaining portion of the body is 
divided into very numerous short rings, on the sides of each 
of which there is a thickened puckered spot, something like a 
beginning tubercle ; it is grooved along the back, and tapers 
to a rather obtuse end, where it is sparingly clothed with 
some delicate hairs. The ventral surface is convex, smooth, 
and flesh-coloured ; and the anus is terminal, there lying 
underneath it a long white spot, produced, perhaps, by some 
dilatation of the intestine. 

The shell, as we have said, is from four to five inches long, 
and as thick as a goose-quill. It is cylindrical, gradually 
tapered at the posterior end, where it becomes more or less 
flexuose, and where it is affixed to the foreign body whence 
it takes its origin. The attachment in our specimen was 
broken off". The colour is opaque white, and the smooth sur- 
face is partially covered with corallines and smaller Serpulae. 
The margin of the aperture is circular, smooth, and even ; 
the other extremity is closed. 

I kept the individual here figured for several days by me, 
to observe its motions. The worm would sometimes remain 
for hours concealed in the shell: and, when it ventured to 
peep out, the branchial tufts were sometimes slowly and cau- 
tiously protruded, and sometimes forced out at once to their 
full extent. After their extrusion they were separated and ex- 
panded, as in the figure, and lay at perfect rest on the bottom 



1 28 Illus'yatiom in British Zoology : — S&pula tubuldria, 

of the plate, in unrivalled beauty, and an object of never failing 
admiration. The worm, however, seemed never either to 
slumber or sleep ; for, on any slight agitation of the water, 
occasioned, for example, by walking across the room or leaning 
on the table, it would at once take alarm, and hurriedly retreat 
within the shelter of its tube. It was never off its guard, 
and would often, when lying apparently in calm indulgence, 
suddenly withdraw, in evident alarm, without a cause but 
what was gendered by its own natural timidity; for the phan- 
toms of dreams are not, it may be, the visitants only of 
higher intelligences, but come as they like, in a fearful or 
cheerful mood, even to these lower things. It never pro- 
truded itself farther than is shown in fig, 23. a ; and, after 
becoming weak and sickly, it first threw off one half of its 
pride, a branchial tuft ; and after several hours the other 
was likewise cast away, when the poor mutilated creature 
buried itself, still living and to live for a day or so longer, in 
its own house and cemetery. 

The anus is at the posterior extremity, as in other worms ; 
but the remains of its food are ejected fi'om the mouth of the 
shell, in small egg-shaped pellets. By what contrivance this 
is done, I do not know: are the pellets forced along the 
dorsal furrow? The fan-shaped fascicles are its breathing 
organs ; and the brushes of bristles in the sides of the 
mantle are the organs which enable it to move up and down 
the tube, assisted, undoubtedly, by the rough spots on the 
margins of the body. This is traversed down the centre of 
the back with a vessel filled with red blood, and which sends 
off minute branches to almost every ring. 

Mr. Berkeley has attempted to draw a distinction between 
Serpula arundo and tubularia. The former, he says, may be 
known " by its more slender form and delicate substance; 
neither is the aperture expanded, as in S. tubularia. The 
animal differs from S. tubularia in its oblong dorsal area; 
while that of the latter is much attenuated behind ; and in the 
absence of the operculum." Now, if we turn to Montagu, 
the original describer of S. tubularia, and whose name 
therefore ought to be retained, we shall find him telling us 
that the animal has no operculum ; and his description of it 
ao-rees exactly, so far as lam able to judge, with Mr. Berkeley's. 
Indeed, it seems to me, that this very acute and excellent 
naturalist has confounded the S. tubularia of Montagu with 
the S. wrmicularis of authors : for, on this supposition, his 
remarks on their distinctive characters will be found per- 
fectly correct and decisive.

your pages, I shall be gratified. I enclose, for your inspec- 
tion, some specimens, which have now been prepared between 
three and four years, and which, you will, I think, allow, give 
a very fair idea of the Fungi in their growing state. 

I am, Sir, yours, &c. 
Clapham Road, Feb, 1834.. W. Christy, Jun. 

The extreme difficulty of preserving Fungi, so as to give 
any idea of their colours or forms, except by the cumbrous 
and expensive plan of putting them in spirits, must have struck 
every one who has paid any attention to this beautiful branch 
of botany. When on a visit, several years since, to my excel- 
lent friend Dr. Hooker of Glasgow, I became much interested 
with a mode which M. Klotzsch (who had then the care of 
the doctor's herbarium) adopted to preserve various JPungi. 
M. Klotzsch was good enough to give me some lessons on his 
plan, by which, I am sorry to say, I have as yet profited little ; 
but I have done at least enough to satisfy myself that it is not 
only practicable, but easy and very successful. Preserving 
jPungi in spirits, besides the expense for spirit and glasses, is 
of little use as regards their colours ; whereas the plan alluded 
to preserves the colours, in most instances, in their native 
brilliancy. M. Klotzsch published, I believe, an account of 
his plan in that valuable work the Botanical Miscellany ; but 
as that work, from its comparatively high price, has a much 
less extensive circulation than your Magazine, I think I may 
be rendering a service to some of the lovers of Fungi by com- 
municating, through your pages, a sketch of the mode as 
known to myself. 

The plan which, in pursuance of M. Klotzsch*s instructions, 

I have adopted, is as follows : — 
With a sharp knife I divide 
the fungus through the pileus 
and stipes into two parts, one 
rather larger than the other. 
From the inside of the larger 
portion I take, in the same 
manner, a thin slice [Jig. 28.), 
which thus affords a complete 
vertical section of the fungus, 
showing the peculiarities in the 
structure of the stipes, pileus, 
and gills. The remaining por- 
tions are then to be treated as 
follows : — Carefully separate 
the pileus {Jig, 29. a) from the 




for Preservation in He7'bariu7ns. 



133 




stipes {b) ; scrape out the gills, and, 
where the fungus is very fleshy, re- 
move also a portion of the solid part 
of the pileus. The vertical section, 
and the respective portions of pileus 
and stipes, are then to be placed in 
blotting-paper, and submitted to 
pressure, as is usual in drying plants. 
It is, however, advisable to expose 
them to the air for a short time, in 
order to wither them, and also to 
apply the pressure at first gently, as 
they are otherwise liable to split and 
crack. If the fungus is of a succulent 
nature, M. Klotzsch recommends 
drying them within the influence of 
the fire, and changing the papers 
several times a day. When dry, the vertical section, with 
the pieces of stipes on which are to be placed the respective 
portions of pileus, may be glued upon 
paper, and the whole will give a very 
good idea of the general appearance 
of the fungus. (Jig. 30.) 

Where a sufficiency of plants of a 
species occur, sections may be made 
of them in their different stages of 
growth, showing the various degrees 
of developement. (^^.31.) 

The very vivid colours of some 
i^ungi (^garicusemeticus and others), 
are, in specimens dried in this man- 
ner, beautifully preserved, as well as 
the forms of some of the most fragile 
and delicate species. 
The advantage which this mode of preservation possesses 
over all others, by enabling us to place 
the specimens in almost as little space as 
other plants in our herbaria, renders it 
worth the notice of all botanists. 

I trust I have made myself intelligible ; 
but any one desirous of farther information 
would doubtless find it in M. Klotzsch's 
paper. Not having the Botanical Mis- 
cellamj at hand, I can only speak from me- 
mory ; but I think the paper will be found 
in the fifth or sixth number of that work

1 34 Short Communications : — 

The dried specimens of funguses sent by Mr. Christy are 
affixed to four tablets of paper, and are thereon named ^gari- 
cus squarrosus Milller, A. peronatus Bolt,^ A. emeticus Schaeff, 
A. pratensis Pers. The place and time in which they were 
obtained are added : the time, as to the year, is 1830. Their 
appearance on the paper is very pleasing, and their character- 
istics seem most satisfactorily exhibited. A» squarrosus is 
illustrated by one specimen, very young ; a vertical section of 
another, a little older ; a profile of one full grown ; and a 
vertical section of another full grown : this last shows the 
relative thickness of the pileus, the depth of the gills, and the 
structure of the stipes. A. peronatus is shown in two pro- 
files and two vertical sections : A. emeticus by a profile and 
two vertical sections ; the external colour of the pileus is a 
fine fulvous red : A. pratensis by two profiles, and four ver- 
tical sections of as many plants in progressive stages of 
growth. The condition of all the specimens proves the excel- 
lence of this mode of preparing them, and this must render a 
knowledge of it very useful to every student of F(xi\g\, We 
hope to see a descriptive notice of it given in the volume on the 
funguses of Britain, now in preparation by Dr. Hooker : it 
will then be under the eye of every one who may endeavour, 
by the help of that work, to attain an acquaintance with these 
plants. — J, D. 



Art. VIII. Short Communications, 

Mammiferous Animals. — Fox at Deptford, — Sir,I scarcely 
know whether you will think it worth noticing among your 
Short Communications, that a fox should have established an 
** at home " within four miles of London Bridge. My garden 
is one that is rather remarkable for having its own way. Some 
years ago, 1 took a great deal of pains to introduce into it all 
kinds of wild flowers, shrubs, and trees, and these have grown 
uninterruptedly and formed large masses of underwood, 
which, being principally composed of bramble and dog-rose, 
have established a seat of empire not easily to be shaken. 
What is termed, vulgarly, a tide-ditch, elegantly, a canal, 
which the river Thames fills at high water, surrounds more 
than two thirds of the garden. In this spot a fox established 
his abode, and made himself very happy for more than six 
weeks. The neighbours lost their fowls, ducks, pigeons, and 
rabbits. Many a long face have I seen pulled about their 
losses ; many a complaint of the " howdaciousness " of the 
rats, the cats, the thieves, and the new police ; in all which I

took very great and sympathising interest. In the mean time, 
I used to sit in my summer-house of an evening, and watch 
master Reynard come out of his retreat ; and a great amuse- 
ment it was to me. He would come slowly trotting along, to 
a round gravelled place, where four paths met; then he 
would raise himself on the sitting part, look about, and listen, 
to ascertain that all was safe, and, being satisfied of this, he 
would commence washing his face with the soft part of the 
leg, just above the pad. After this operation was well per- 
formed, he used to lie flat down on his belly and walk delibe- 
rately along with his fore legs, dragging the rest of his person 
along the gravel, as though it were quite dead, or, at least, 
deprived of motion ; then he would run round and round 
after his brush ; which I could see he sometimes bit pretty 
severely, and on such occasions he would turn serious all at 
once, and whisk his brush about in a very angry manner. 
Poor fellow ! a neighbour happened to see him cross the 
ditch by moonlight into my garden with an old hen in his 
mouth. The outcry was raised; a search was demanded. 
Next day there came guns, dogs, pitchforks, and — neigh- 
bours ; the upshot of all which was, that poor Reynard's 
brush is dangling in my little wainscotted room between an 
Annibal Caracci and a Batista. — E, N. D. Dec. 14. 1833.

Instances of depraved Appetite in Mammiferoiis Animals, 
(V. 714., VI. 364.)— Sir, The case of a dog's eating heath 
mould, related in p. 714. of Vol. V., is, as you observe, 
more strange than the case I have, in Vol. III. p. 364., 
described, of a dog's eating oats, as oats are, as you have 
observed, of the nature of part of a dog's food ; such as, 
" bran, pollard, barley-meal," &c. : but I think that the dog's 
eating mould was occasioned by a depraved appetite, similar 
to that in human creatures who eat coals, mould, &c., of 
which many cases are on record. I lately met with a case of 
this disease, mentioned in a recent work on the West Indies. 
The writer states that he saw a slave who was in the habit of 
eating earth in large quantities. He seemingly considered it 
a luxury. Yours, — J. M. Haughton le Skerme, County of 
Durham^ August 20. 1833. 

A somewhat large, and a very interesting, collection of in- 
stances of depraved appetite in the human species will be 
found in Good's Study of Medicine. Humboldt, in his Tableaux 
de la Nature, informs us that the Otomacs sometimes appease 
their hunger by distending their stomachs with prodigious 
quantities of slightly baked clay.

136 Short Communicatio7is : — 

In farther illustration of this subject we present 
Some Instances of depraved Appetite in the domestic Rabbit, 
taken from a communication on the habits of this animal, con- 
tributed by our correspondent, Wm. G. Barker. After he 
has described the usual articles of food with domestic rabbits, 
he thus proceeds : — 

They will drink ale with avidity, but in this matter, I must 
own, they show much greater sense than pigs, two or three 
spoonfuls sufficing them. But the appetite of the rabbit ap- 
pears to have no bounds : vegetables are their natural food ; 
but I unhesitatingly assert that they feed upon animal sub- 
stances both dead and living. Some few of your readers will 
undoubtedly feel surprised at this declaration : I have, how- 
ever, seen it myself. Depravity of appetite is far from being 
peculiar to the rabbit. If time and space allowed me, I could 
refer to a kestrel (Falco Tinnunculus L.), now in my posses- 
sion ; and to some remarkable anecdotes of hyaenas, by Pro- 
fessor Biickland, in his valuable Reliquice Diluviance, Of these 
in their season. Many, I may say the whole, of your readers 
have, in all probability, kept rabbits in their younger days, 
and they must, therefore, be well aware that the male has so 
great a propensity to devour the young ones, that breeders of 
rabbits always remove him from the doe, at the time of kind- 
ling. As soon, however, as the young ones can see, there 
remains not the slightest danger to them, from him * ; on the 
contrary, he will sometimes display great ferocity in defend- 
ing them from their enemies. Far otherwise the doe: if the 
young are born dead, as they not unfrequently are, they are, 
in most cases, immediately devoured by the mother ; and some 
have this unnatural propensity in so strong a degree, that the 
offspring, though born alive, share the same fate. I have 
known one remarkable and solitary instance of a doe who 
killed her whole brood, when two months old. They were 
tolerably fine young rabbits, lively, and appeared healthy, but 
there was something in them which exasperated their mother, 
for she seemed wholly bent upon destroying them. It was not 
done at once, nor in a few hours, but occupied her about ten 

* I have known an instance of a male inducing the death of a young 
rabbit, between a third and half grown. The latter, and all those of the 
same litter, were moving about on the floor of the apartment, out of their 
hutch, when the male forced open the door of his own hutch and sprang 
among them, and bit through the skin of one of them behind the shoulders. 
In the struggling of the young rabbit to get away, and the detention of it 
by the male, the skin, in an instant, was torn off a considerable portion of 
its back, although not wholly detached from the portion of skin left re- 
maining; insomuch that it was judged proper to kill the little rabbit 
instantly, and this was done. — J. D.

days. I do not, however, mean that she was employed the 
whole of that time in the operation of slaughtering, as two or 
three days intervened between the death of each. It was painful 
to see her chase the little unoffending creature round the hutch, 
in frenzied passion, and literally thirsting for its blood ; but 
there was no alternative : to remove it from her was certain 
death, to allow it to remain was to leave it in the jaws of de- 
struction : one after another, they all were slain. One of 
those which perished in this manner had received a wound 
from her teeth and claws in the side, through which the bowels 
protruded. As soon as it was dead, nay, even before the 
breath had left the mangled body, the unnatural brute, and 
the surviving young ones, eagerly devoured the whole of the 
carcass, and even the bones, leaving nothing of their horrid 
banquet but a portion of the skin, the legs, and, if I mistake not, 
the head. Until then, I had thought maternal love inviolate in 
the brute creation. I have since found, from other sources, 
that they share the depravity of man. If any person presumed 
to touch one of the young rabbits above mentioned, its death 
was sure to follow almost immediately. What renders the 
above account more remarkable is, that the animals had just 
received their morning's allowance of food ; but the deaths ge- 
nerally happened after feeding time. May I here be allowed 
to ask some of your medical readers, might not this extraor- 
dinary and unnatural depravity arise from some disease in the 
organs of smell, and, perhaps, in the stomach also ? The 
mother invariably examined them, which rabbits always do, 
by smelling, previous to commencing her attack. — Wrn, G,

Gooseberry-eating Dogs, (VI. 364.) — Grammarians tell

J. D.'s is comparative ; mine is superlative. The book people, 
and the technical people, and the anti-Natural History Maga- 
zine people may laugh at all three, dubbing us, by way of 
epithet, stultus, stiiUior, stultissimus : but no matter; I cannot 
let my poor old favourite Crib, and his favourite appetites, be 
forgotten like a common dog or a common propensity, when 
the oat-cracking, gooseberry-crushing candidates for immor- 
tality are eternised by Mr. Loudon. 

My friend Crib was a dog of talent and discerning; 
he was bred at Ely, and educated at Cambridge; having 
graduated with his master, as Bachelor of Arts, in the year 
1821. Like Ulysses *, he was one of the ugliest and 
most eloquent of animals, and his very exuberance of black

whisker and eyebrow, and his unceasing bark, made him 
noticeable by day and night. I never was given to such pas- 
times, but I am told he would dive after a waterfowl, and 
draw a badger; accomplishments some years since in high 
odour with puppies at the Universities ; now, I hope, in these 
reforming days, abandoned for more philosophical and classical 
pursuits. Crib, therefore, did not want courage. He was 
Cerberus from that time till his death, in 1831, at my resi- 
dence in Suffolk, and during those ten years became cele- 
brated as a guardian by night, a companion by day, an enemy 
of poachers, the friend of cats, and, like J. D.'s Toby, a 
mighty connoisseur in gooseberries. I have no time here to 
tell all his adventures with a monkey and a snake, which I 
kept with him as playmates ; but I may add that Toby, with 
all his " taste" and " well-bred" enjoyment, does not appear 
to have arrived at Mr. Crib's state of renown. I found him, 
one day, in the garden, performing Toby's feat of gooseberry- 
crushing ; thereby discovering the depredator, whom we had 
long unjustly considered a two-legged dog. In his heedless- 
ness, he swallowed a berry, in which was a wasp. The wasp 
stung his throat; and the agony, to judge by his grimaces, 
must have been intense. From that hour he became the 
mortal enemy of the whole race of wasps, and his skill in 
destroying them was remarkable. Baring his teeth by the 
withdrawal of his Hps (V. 386.), he would wait under his 
favourite bushes till the wasps appeared, and then, snapping 
at them, he contrived to kill them without injury to himself. 
I have seen dozens of those marauders mingled with the 
gooseberry husks under the bushes, but I never recollect an 
instance of their doing their destroyer an injury after the first 
insult. The dog never forgot the circumstance ; a wasp ever 
after became an object of pursuit with him. This, however, 
was not all : amongst other things. Crib, like his namesake of 
the ring, was a tippler as well as boxer ; and nothing de- 
lighted him so much as a saucerful of warm elderberry wine, 
which he regularly partook at Christmas with the family. 
I have seen him, more than once, " pretty considerably decent 
tipsy," as they say in America ; but justice compels me to say 
that this was his only fgwling: a more moral dog, in every 
other respect, never lived, and one more regretted never died. 
The day I left my native place, he laid himself down at the 
foot of my chair, burst a blood-vessel, and expired. He sleeps 
in his quiet grave, under the shadow of one of the most 
splendid oaks in all Suffolk; and his epitaph might put to 
the blush many, perhaps, who may call its writer, for this

Acts, possibly analogous, in the Lion and the Youn,^ of the 
Domestic Cat. — In playing with a cat, young enough not to 
refuse to play, it is observable that, when the cat has enclosed 
your hand in its (all four) paws, and has also applied its 
mouth to your flesh, ready to both lacerate and bite you at 
the very next tickle, should you adventure one more, yet, if 
you do not adventure one more, and hold your hand perfectly 
still, you may usually save yourself the laceration and biting 
threatened you, and, at the cat's own good pleasure, be entirely 
released from its grasp. I have fancied there is a similarity 
in this conduct of the cat of our hearth, and that of the lion 
to Major Woodhouse, as described by Mr. Waterton. (p. 5.) 
J.D. 

A few Words on Cats.— J. W. L. (V. 275.) tells of a cat 
at Dorking, which never ate the mice he caught, but laid 
them at the feet of the first person he met. My father had a 
white male cat, about the year 1815 (when we resided at East 
Bergholt, in Suffolk), which was even more sportsman-like 
than his Dorking compatriot. In a meadow bank, behind 
the house, were abundance of rabbits; the cat would go 
thither, and bring away his game, even rabbits more than 
half-grown, and, without injuring them in any way, would 
take them into the house, lay them at the feet of any one he 
met, and retire to the door, to prevent the escape of his prey. 
This I remember to have occurred frequently, till, in one of 
his poaching expeditions, poor Tom was taken in a snare laid 
for his game, and delivered over to the executioner, to be 
dene with according to game law. 

J. D. (V. 276. and 674.), X. (V. 674..), and Mancuniensis 
(V. 717.), speak of cats without tails. The last observes 
that they are plentiful in the part of the Isle of Man 
called '« the Calf of Man." This can hardly be, as the 
Calf of Man is a smaller island at the southern extremity 
of Man, and is not peopled or inhabited, save by the family 
of the person who has charge of the splendid lighthouse 
erected there. I do not exactly agree in the description 
given by Mancuniensis, though the tailless cats of Man are 
tall. When I was in the island, with some college friends, in 
the long vacation of 1820, we had much amusement with 
these curious creatures. I saw several in the huts of the 
peasantry, amongst the mountains, between Ramsay and Peel 
Town ; but as the honest people did not speak English, and we 
spoke no Manx, I learned nothing of their history there. But 
mentioning the subject to a person at Balla Salla, near Castle 



1 40 Short Commu7iications : — 

Rushen, and not very far from the Calf, I was informed that 
a vessel from Prussia, or some port in the Baltic, was wrecked 
many years ago on the rocky shore between Castle Rushen 
and the Calf, and that, on her driving close in to the land, two 
or three cats without tails made their escape from the bowsprit, 
and were taken by the wreckers ; and that these were the first 
of the kind ever seen in the island. I do not say that this is 
the truth, but I was told so ; and, if it be the truth, the original 
breed is not of Manx extraction, but must be sought out in 
the north of Europe. I do not agree, though, in the emend- 
ation of Mancuniensis, who recommends (V. 717.) reading 
« Isle of Man" for " Isle of Wight;" for Dr. Leach's cat 
might have been wrecked there, or imported thither, as well 
as its contemporaries to the Isle of Man. 

Whilst on the subject, I will allude to a tale which was told 
me when a boy, of an extraordinary instance of the powers of 
abstinence of the cat. I forget the minutiae of the story, but 
it ran thus : — A cat, which belonged to a vessel from the 
port of Mistley, in Essex (a place about four miles from East 
Bergholt), was missing when the vessel sailed from some har- 
bour in America, and no one could tell what had become of it. 
But on arriving in a part of the Channel where it was neces- 
sary to unfurl a sail that had not been employed till then 
during the voyage, the cat was discovered, in a sadly ema- 
ciated condition, in the folds of the sail, and, notwithstanding 
her long imprisonment, still alive. My informant was the 
late Mr. Dunthorne of London Street (a young self-taught 
artist, of rising and deserved celebrity, whose industry, taste, 
and acquirements, in spite of difficulties and want of " ap- 
pliances and means to boot," made him an extraordinary 
instance of the power of genius and talent, and would have 
wrought out for him a distinguished place in English bio- 
graphy, had not a too early death taken him away from us*) ; 
but I cannot now, in consequence of his having recently paid 
the debt of nature, appeal to him for further information. If, 
however, there be any feline Sadducees amongst your readers, 
I would venture to assert that this story may have been true, 
judging from an instance which I can fully attest by the evi- 
aence of self-experience, and the testimony (if required) of 
two or three friends. The Dutch commenced the siege of 
Brussels, in the revolution of 1830, in the month of Septem- 
ber. On the 24th of that month, they took possession of the 
house of my friend. Dr. Verstraeten, rue de Namur; and, after

barbarously destroying his furniture and drinking all his 
wine, shut up his cat, with the empty bottles, in a closet in 
the kitchen. As the family were driven out of the house at 
the point of the bayonet, to seek shelter where they could, no 
thought was taken of any thing but their preservation. On 
the 15th October (just 21 days afterwards), I accompanied 
Dr. Verstraeten and some friends to his house, to see the 
ruins, and, on descending to the kitchen, the door of the 
above-named closet was opened, and immediately the cat, 
which had remained there a prisoner since the battle, came 
bounding out with a look and a cry of hunger and joy. Dr. 
Verstraeten remarked himself, that the cat was supposed to 
have been lost or killed, and expressed his surprise at her 
existence so long without food. The poor animal could not 
have had any food (unless a mouse or two) during her im- 
prisonment, as the house contained nothing which had escaped 
the piratical hands of the besiegers, save a solitary bottle of 
preserved gooseberries, the only entire article in the house. 
The poor thing looked as wretched as possible; but she de- 
voured most voraciously some food we procured from a house 
opposite, and lived to do justice to her deliverer from " durance 
vile." 

Since I wrote the above, I have been informed, by Captain 
T. Testing, R. N., of this place, that a favourite cat belonging 
to his family, which was transported from Andover hither, 
suddenly decamped, and, after being on his travels nine days, 
arrived, " hungry and sore bested," at his old quarters, 
having discovered his way across the country without a guide.

gian. — W. B. Clarke, Parkstone, near Poole, Dec. 18. 1832.

" In the Sappho, lately arrived from Nova Scotia, at Bid-

middle of the cargo. She had been a prisoner 29 days, and, 
of course, had nothing to subsist on during that time ; she 
was still alive, but almost a skeleton. The captain gave her 
some milk, of which she drank greedily, and is now slowly 
recovering.*' {Western Luminary, Aug. 6. 1833.) 

The Baltic trader, Mary, Capt. Ritchie, arrived a few days 
ago at Leith, with a cargo of flax from St. Petersburgh. On 
unpacking one of the bundles of flax, a cat was found bound 
up and much compressed within it, but still alive. The vessel 
had been 28 days on its passage. The cat revived. {Betroiso's

of their tailless Cats to a Sport of Nature, — Mancuniensis 
(V. 717.) remarks that the cats without tails, in the Isle 
of Man, are more like the hare or the rabbit; and this 
circumstance may account for such an impossibility being 
stated as the following, which appeared in the British Tra- 
veller (May, 1823): " There is in the possession of Mr. 
Henley, at Chatham, a cat, which has littered a kitten and 
four rabbits ! ! " A writer in the Manx paper, in allusion to 
the above, remarks : — " We are inclined to believe the four 
rabbits to be nothing more than kittens of the same descrip-

must originally have been a freak of dame Nature's here, which 
she is now showing at Chatham." — James Fennell, Layton-

P. S. In the possession of the friend in whose house I am

obtain in the flying squirrel. Some time after the appearance 
of the number of this Magazine for May, 1829, in which was 
given the first of the above notices, I was requested by a lady 
in this neighbourhood to examine a flying squirrel, a general 
favourite with her family. I found the upper incisors very 
much elongated, and inclined under the lower jaw ; rendering 
it out of the little animal's power to take his usual food, as 
there was no possibility of the opposition of the extremities 
of the upper and lower incisors. I considered that the disease 
might be remedied, by removing such a portion of the upper 
incisors as would allow them to come properly in contact with 
those of the lower jaw. This I easily effected, by means of a 
pair of forceps. I have frequently seen the little animal 
since, and have had the satisfaction of observing him busily at 
work on his nuts, and of learning from his mistress that he 
has since that time taken his food as before the disease had 
occurred. — John Reynolds Rowe. Wimborne, Dorset, Jan. 1, 
1834. 

Among the numerous individuals of the common squirrel

of the grubs of the Balaninus nucum Germar, preferring, for 
the sake of them, the maggoty nuts to the sound ones ; and 
I have known it eat the small caterpillars which are found in 
blackberries and pears. Are these appetites morbid ones, 
from the animal's domesticated condition ? Cannot the 
animal be employed to avail us in gardening objects, as the 
caterpillars, &c., it might destroy would fully compensate the 
little damage it could do the fruit? — Jo/m Perry ^jun, Godal-

The wonders and beauties which Nature displays

When I lived in the cottage at the end of the garden that 
now adjoins the house I reside in, and my business called me 
sometimes earlier than I am now willing to leave my bed, I 
have been delighted in a summer's morning to hear the pleas- 
ing note of the goldfinch busy amongst the dew-bespangled 
foliage of the apple trees ; the blackbird, perched on the 
highest branches of the highest trees, cheering its mate with 
its song ; the lark caroling over my head ; joined by the deep 
bass of a contiguous colony of rooks. In moments like these, 
I have found myself elevated and inspired with pity for those 
to whom, according to their own declaration, " this goodly 
frame, the earth, seems a sterile promontory," to whom " this 
most excellent canopy the air, this brave o'erhang'd firmament, 
this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, appears nothing 
but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours." At times 
like these, I have made resolutions to rise earlier, that I might 
the more fully enjoy the beauties and tlie harmony of nature :

but my propensity to indulge myself in the arms of Mor- 
pheus has too often gotten the better of my resolution. 

Larks always in fine weather hail the earliest dawn of day 
with their song, and sometimes sing before the dawn, as I 
have recently learned in a journey by the night coach (the 
Red Rover) from Cambridge to London. I and my fellow 
travellers were surprised to hear the singing of the lark as 
early as two o'clock on a frosty morning, on the 7th of May 
(1833). The subject furnished us with agreeable chat, and 
roused us from our inclination to sleep : before it was ex- 
hausted, we were greeted with the song of the nightingale and 
cuckoo. The house sparrow, as we approached near London, 
was chirping. The sun was rising. The metropolis of 
England was in view. We arrived at the Flower-pot (a sign 
suggested from nature), in Bishopsgate Street, almost forgetting 
that we had lost a night's rest. 

BirdSf at least Smging Birds, are Lovers of Music. [VL 523.] 
— A goldfinch of neighbour 's, in whose room the Pri- 
mitive Methodists hold their meetings, always sang with the 
congregation, whether by day oi* night. I have observed the 
robin, when I have whistled to him, appear pleased, and 

listen with attention. My nephew , who plays on the 

violin, had a linnet that always appeared delighted when the 
violin was played. The early singing of the lark, of which I 
have spoken, was possibly owing to the bird's being aroused 
by the sound of the guard's bugle ; it was immediately after 
the guard's playing a tune that we observed the singing of the 
lark, in a field near Buntingford, the London side of Royston. 
Rustici, 

At " vernal dawn" the larks pour forth a concert of music 
as they sit on the clods. I witnessed this on April 16. 1833, 
in passing some lands sown with barley, three miles north of 
Cambridge : the barley was just visibly up. — J. D, 

The small dark browji Thrush of the Western Islands of Scot- 
land, which W. L, deems of an undescrihed Species. (III. 238., 
notet, VL 218. 516., VIL 75.) -— Mr. Blyth states, in VL 
516., that 1 have mistaken the redwing (7\irdus iliacus) for 
the brown thrush of the western islands. Now, I beg to say 
that the redwing, even at a considerable distance, is very 
easily distinguished from every other species of Turdus, by 
size, attitude, and general colour combined together ; for, 
although its watchful and listening air, and its colour, resemble 
much those of the fieldfare ( T. pilaris), when this species is 
observed at a distance, yet it is so much less (being, indeed, 
the least of the genus), that there can be no mistake between 
the two. Besides, I have several times noticed it at a dis- 



Birds, 145 

tance, by its own peculiar and distinguishing mark ; namely, 
the large ash-coloured streak near the eye, so like that of the 
stonechat. 

The dark brown thrush that I first saw in the Lewis, and 
have so often observed passing north in spring, is a very 
sober and plain-looking bird as to colour ; and has nothing of 
the airiness and elegance of the redwing, being shorter and 
thicker ; and is very sparingly mottled on the breast. In fact, 
both as to shape and colour, it might pass for a large edition 
of the hedge sparrow (ikfotacilla familiaris). I have, I am 
sure, seen hundreds of them, and not a redwing among the 
number. Moreover, I would refer to a footnote [note f] 
affixed to a communication of mine, in III. 237, 238., where 
it is mentioned that Mr. Macgillivray saw this same brown 
thrush breaking whelks on the shore. It must be allowed 
that this enthusiastic and now skilful naturalist (from nought 
else that I can suppose but innate modesty) took it for 
granted that these thrushes were of the common species (T*. 
musicus). With not one tenth of his knowledge, I, with all 
the rashness of a little learning, when I heard them singing 
on these desolate shores, guessed that they must belong to a 
different species ; and I hope I may be allowed to refer to 
and cite the above note, '' I was greatly surprised to hear 
the song of the thrush resounding on all sides from the heathy 
and rocky banks of the sea (' wasting her sweet notes on the 
desert air ') ; but I have always suspected it to be another 
species, darker and less." And so I am, with all due defer- 
ence to Mr. E. Blyth, still convinced it really is ; and I beg 
that Mr. Blyth will not take it as anything like want of 
respect, when I use the freedom to suggest that there may be 
more things to be seen, among the moors and rocks and bosky 
glens of Scotland, than " he has yet dreamt of in his philo- 
sophy." What if there may be not only plants and birds, but 
two or three quadrupeds, that he has never seen? But, I 
would like to know, who has seen the nests of the redwing 
there ? 

I request to add that the migratory birds, in their journeys, 
alternately, to their native homes and their winter abodes, 
seem to keep generally along the " back-bone of the country." 
The redwing, after all, I take to be comparatively a rare bird ; 
for, although I have seen redwings both in spring and No- 
vember, I have seen but few. It is in the upland glens of 
Selkirkshire, Tweeddale, and Dumfriesshire, and not on the 
plains of Lothian, the Merse, or " the Laigh of Teviotdale," 
that the flocks of female chaffinches, grey linnets, thrushes, 
starlings, and snowflecks are seen. I well remember the

Owls capture Fishes for Food. — In addition to the instances 
of this fact already registered in I. 179., II. 288., V. 13., the 
following one, told me by a friend, may be cited. In the 
neighbourhood of Harrowgate there is a large building called 
the Observatory, which affords from its summit an extensive 
view. A pair of owlets, taken from a nest in an adjoining wood, 
were placed in a cage on the summit of the tower, and for 
nearly six weeks the old birds came every evening to feed 
them there. They brought them, in addition to mice and 
pieces of flesh, frequently fishes. The river Nidd is three miles 
from the spot. Could they have procured the fishes thence ?

An Instance of the Barn OwVs seeking its Food at Mid-day

between the hours of twelve and one o'clock in the middle of 
the day. The sun was shining brightly at the time. The owl, 
as the sequel proved, was seeking food. After I had watched 
it for some minutes, I saw it descend, and light upon the side 
of a bank of an old watercourse, and remain there for the 
space of a minute. It appeared to me to be working hard 
with its talons during that time, as if removing something 
that impeded its immediate attack on its prey. At the ex- 
piration of that period its labour was crowned with reward, for 
it then took wing, bearing away in its talons a fine mouse. —

* I am aware that there are often exceptions to these (as I suppose) gene- 
ral habits ; for I have often seen hawks of different species skimming with 
great swiftness southwards over the downs and fields of these districts, 
generally during a fall of snow. On July 24. 1830, I met a small flight of 
water swallows (Hinindo riparia), and, about ten minutes after, another, 
flying south over Bowden Muir, about seven o'clock in the afternoon. 
They were evidently on a journey ; besides, it was nearly two miles from 
the Tweed, which they were apparently leaving. Again : a friend has told 
me that while himself and a companion were returning home early from a 
party in Edinburgh, on a foggy morning, they heard a flock of wild geese 
passing close over the city. They were aware of this from the repeated 
calls of the geese to one another, which calls were probably necessary to 
prevent separation : but they likewise distinctly heard the sound of their 
wings, which the stillness of the streets of Edinburgh at such an hour 
made easily distinguishable. The winged travellers were passing north- 
ward, as their course was indicated by their calls dying away in the increas- 
ing distance.

— A pellet, which T, about February, 1833, found in Bays- 
water meadows, on the flat top of a tree's truncated stem, 
left in a hedgerow as a huge post, contained the fur and 
bones of two field campagnols (Arvicola agrestis Flem.), as I 
have learned by submitting the skull bones to the inspection 
of an excellent comparative anatomist. — J. D, 

The Carrion Crom. — Mr. Wateiton's admirable history 
of the habits of this bird, and his able advocacy of its merits, 
in VI. 208. to 214., have given me, and must all who have 
read them, extreme pleasure. One vice, however, is charge- 
able on the crow, to which Mr. Waterton has not adverted. 
This bird has a strong predilection for the eyes of sheep. I 
speak from my own knowledge ; for I have really caught this 
bird in the very act and deed of plucking out the eyes of a 
lamb ere it had scarcely drawn the vital air; hence, in 
" lambing-time," particularly where sheep are kept upon 
wastes and commons, which is much the case in Yorkshire, 
you will be almost sure to see a carrion crow or two lurking 
among them. The bird, with much cunning, watches the 
movements of the sheep, and, if the shepherd should not be 
constantly on the alert, the flock will most likely suffer some 
loss. The ewe, when about to bring forth, is very restless, 
lying down and getting up, &c., almost at every minute. 
The cause of this uneasiness the crow appears to know full 
well ; for, sometimes before the parturient process is half 
over, the luckless offspring is bereft of one or perhaps of both 
its eyes. The crow is a most expert operator in this busi- 
ness : the villanous deed is finished by his murderous bill in 
the twinkling of an eye. I have also known these ravenous 
birds to deprive sheep of their visual organs, when, from 
sickness or the infirmities of old age, or from being entangled 
with thorns and briars, they were incapable of resistance. 
The carrion crow does not, on leaving its nest, cover its 
eggs : Professor Rennie was therefore in error when he 
stated that it did. — Thomas Weather illy M, D, Livetyool^

[ TheTitmice (Pdrus major and a^ruleus, and dter and jpalustris 
may he added) mil sometimes feed on Walnuts *isohile these are yet

registered in III. 476., IV. 166., V. 489. 655. to 6QS,'] They 
eat the walnuts, attacking and devouring them as they grow on 
the tree, and before they are ripe enough to quit the green out- 
side husk. A walnut tree on the premises here affords peculiar 
facilities to the operations of these little depredators : it bears 
nuts which are frequently more or less imperfect in their shells ; 
that is, the shells, instead of being composed throughout of a

hard woody substance, are partially defective towards the apex 
on each side, or consist of a soft texture easily pervious to the 
bills of the titmice. Here, at the soft or imperfect apex of the 
shell, these birds commence their attack, and peck out the 
kernel to the utmost depth that their bills will reach. I have 
frequently known the entire kernel completely scooped out by 
the titmice, before the nut was ripe enough to fall from the 
tree. On one large tree, with a good crop, scarcely a walnut 
remained that had not been attacked by these birds, and more 
or less eaten. I mention this circumstance merely as a fact 
in natural history ; not by any means with a view to blacken 
the character of the birds in question, a race which, I cannot 
help thinking, is already more persecuted than it deserves 
to be.* 

{The Rook, VI. 142. VII. 100.] — For a similar reason, 
and with no unfriendly feeling towards the rooks, I may 
state that they also have a relish for walnuts. I have seen 
them settle on the trees, several in a party, and, plucking off 
the nuts, fly away with them to a distance. Whetlier they 
swallow the walnuts whole, or, as I rather suspect, stock 
through the shell and extract the kernel, I cannot positively 
say. One autumn I was rather at a loss how to account for 
the number of walnuts, some in their green husks, and some 
without, which were to be seen strewed on the walks under 
the elm trees which the rooks occupy as their breeding-place 
in the spring. Recollecting that the rooks occasionally plun- 
dered the walnut trees, and also that a day seldom passed 
without their reconnoitring their spring quarters, I was led to

conclude that the stray walnuts were such as had been acci- 
dentally dropped by the birds in their attempt to extract the 
kernels from the shells. Whatever may be urged in pre- 
judice of the rooks, and, besides eating a few walnuts, they 
certainly do peck up and devour a portion of the newly sown 
corn, they ought to be regarded as useful and beneficial crea- 
tures to man, and by intelligent persons are generally allowed 
to be so, for the reasons so ably shown by T. G. in VI. 142. 
-- W. T. Bree, Allesley Rectory, June 12. 18.33. 

The partiality of rooks for walnuts is such as to render 
it not unprofitable, in an orchard of walnut trees, to keep a 
boy as a scarecrow, or rather scarerook, to prevent their 
helping themselves to the walnuts too extensively. A rook, 
having plucked a walnut, will, in its wariness, usually fly off to 
a common,, or any open place which may be not very distant, 
to eat it unmolested. Occasionally a rook is induced to abandon 
uninjured a walnut or other nut which it had borne off from 
the tree that had yielded it, and such nut may, and in some 
instances doubtless does, vegetate and produce a tree; and 
hence, and from similar accidents with other birds, it is that 
birds form one of the classes enumerated by naturalists in 
their catalogue of Nature's agents in disseminating plants. 
(See V. 527. note *.) The springing of an oak tree from 
an acorn buried by " a raven" has been likened to Melan- 
choly burying Hope, " which Providence still keeps alive," 
in eight lines of poetry published in Dr. Hodson's selection 
of poems called The Bouquet, 2 vols. 8vo. 1 792. The lines 
were copied off " a pane of glass at Kingsgate ;" and, although 
entitled " a fable," describe an incident very likely to have 
happened : the poet, perchance, mistaking a rook for a raven. 

Companies of Rooks delight to assemble and build near human 
Residences. — Mr. Jennings and others entertain this idea; 
and the following fact tends to establish it. In the grounds 
of Mr. Hope, at Deepdene, there are some trees on which 
rooks used to build invariably before the mansion was de- 
stroyed. This house stood close by the trees. Mr. Hope 
added Chart Park to his own at Deepdene ; and, as he did 
not wish to keep both mansions, the old Chart House was 
pulled down. No rooks have built on the trees since, though 
the trees remain in precisely the same state. — W, Fowler, 
Dec, 17. 1834. 

Instances of' Enmity evinced by the Rook and the Magpie to the 
Kestrel Ha-jok, (p. 105.) — Iwas much amused, the other day, in 
witnessing an engagement that took place, over a small grove, 
between a kestrel hawk, five magpies, and four rooks. My 
attention was called, when at some distance, by the loud cries 

L 3 



150 Short Communications : — 

of war. The rooks attacked the kestrel in the air, hovering 
over and around him, and were sometimes in close contact 
with him ; and when he^ as if to gain breath, alighted on any 
tree, up came the magpies "with their loud clang of war, and 
fiercely carried on the combat. Again the kestrel mounted 
into the air, which the rooks no sooner beheld than at him 
they went, apparently as fierce as ever, and so they and the 
magpies continued alternately attacking him for about a quar- 
ter of an hour ; when he drove the rooks off, and, after having 
another round or two with the magpies, he left them, and 
soared off into quieter regions. The sight was the more in- 
teresting to myself, from my having but just left a friend who 
had related to me a description of a similar engagement, which 
he had witnessed between a kestrel and three rooks ; and 
about a week since another friend told me of an engagement 
which he had seen, but with only one magpie. Both occurred 
within a mile from the place at which I saw the action. — T. 
Aylesbury^ Oct. 14. 1833. 

[In the Field Naturalist, ii. 74., a correspondent tells of a 
kestrel and a magpie, which a countryman had seen fighting 
on the ground. " He approached them ; the hawk en- 
deavoured to escape, but the magpie held her so firmly by the 
leg, which he had grasped in his claw, that she could not 
escape, and both were taken with the hand."] 

Habits of the Jackdaw (VI. 394. 396. 516.), Anecdotes an a 
domesticated One, — Being informed that with the cleanliness 
and management of the parish workhouse at Kidderminster 
I should be much pleased, I accompanied a clerical friend to 
visit it; and was gratified on finding the information true. 
Noticing a jackdaw at large in the governess's parlour, mani- 
festing as much self-consequence as if the whole establish- 
ment were under its control, I was told that the bird had 
become domesticated there when young, and had ever since 
been quite a free agent about the premises and neighbouring 
fields, and that it was a privileged pet and favourite, notwith- 
standing its many peccadilloes of pilfering and stealing. I 
learned farther as follows : — After it had been some time 
an inmate, it having observed that " the copper-drawer," 
in which pence and halfpence for household disbursements 
are kept, engaged a particular portion of the governess's care, 
one day, no sooner was this drawer unlocked and left open, 
than the bird began to carry into it whatever rags and loose 
things it could find. At first they were thrown out ; when, fast 
as possible, the bird, apparently in displeasure, carried them 
in again. The governess, thinking it strange, submitted to 
the bird's humour, by leaving the drawer open, after securing

the coin by locking the room door. It was then the spring 
season of the year. In the course of a few days, she was 
surprised to find that " Jack " had laid two or three eggs, 
and went on laying until it had laid the usual number. The 
bird was thus, for the first time, discovered to be a female. 
Though, in her rambles abroad, she had met with a sweetheart, 
her old quarters of peace and plenty were preferred to all the 
privileges of precarious freedom. From whatever excursions 
she might choose to take during the day, she always returned 
home in proper roosting time at night. 

A caged Fieldfare, — In the same apartment, and, like 
Miss Jack, perfectly contented, was a caged fieldfare, singing 
sweetly, it being summer time. I was not a little pleased to 
see a winter bird so happy in a strange land ; but more sur- 
prised was I to know that it is a bird of song. In its wild 
state, during its hybernal visit, we have only one or two notes, 
and those somewhat discordant, uttered as a call to its com- 
panions ; but the notes of this feathered stranger resembled 
the woodlark's, subdued and warbling. It was originally 
brought to the kind-hearted governess, as a pensioner, with 
a gunshot wound. She doctored and recovered it ; and the 
bird, like its jetty friend Jenny Daw, is quite satisfied with its 
" settlement." — L. Booker, LL,D, Dudley, Jan. 7. 1834'.

The Account of the Oyster- catcher (VI. 151-2.) reminded 
me of a circumstance relating to that bird which was entered 
in my notes during a visit at Ramsgate in 1830, and which 
is an additional proof of its capability of swimming and 
diving. 

On November 12., in that year, being out shooting with 
a friend, we beat round Pegwell Bay, crossed the Sandwich 
Haven in a ferry-boat, and proceeded along the shore till 
opposite the blockade station-house beyond Shellness, when 
an oyster-catcher flew past, which I shot at, and winged. It 
fell in the water, and swam boldly. The shore was flat and 
sandy, the sea calm and shallow, and the tide gently ebbing. 
Having no dog with us, my friend, anxious to secure the 
bird, actually undressed, and took the water after it, as it was 
making out to sea ; on coming up, he stooped to catch it, 
but it eluded his grasp by diving, and was lost to view till it 
emerged at a distance of several yards from him. He re- 
peated the attempt two or three times, but with no better 

L 4 



152 Short Communications : — 

success. He then returned to the water's edge, shivering 
with cold. Nothing daunted, however, he took my double 
gun, and proceeded to the charge a second time. He fired, 
but with little effect; as, on trying to take the bird up, it 
dived again, though it did not remain so long under water as 
before, owing, no doubt, to its wounds. When it rose again, 
he killed it. These birds I noticed in pairs, and in little 
parties of four or six, all the autumn ; but as winter ap- 
proached, their numbers greatly increased. I have a spe- 
cimen, killed by myself on September 10., which possesses 
the white mai*k under the chin. — T, G. Chippiiig Norton,

The Peqfoiscl (Pdvo cristdtus L.) £5 the natural Eiiemy of 
the Serpent Tribe, (VI. 515.) — An opinion to this amount

I have now to communicate two facts which seem to fully 
justify it. The first lias been related to me by an eye-witness 
of it; the second is included in an extract from a letter sent 
to me by my esteemed friend, the Hon. and Rev. Charles 
Bathurst. — M. Chalmers, M, D. Hull, Dec. 12. 1833. 

A peacock was observed to remain for several days near to 
a hotbed frame in the garden at Raynell, and to make fre- 
quent attempts to break the glass of the frame with his beak, 
and, although he was repeatedly driven away from it, he as 
constantly returned to it again as soon as the gardener had 
left the spot. This circumstance at length attracted the atten- 
tion of the late Mr. Sykes (M. P. for Hull), who caused the 
frame to be removed, when the peacock instantly leaped into 
the bed, scratched away some part of the manure, under which 
he found a nest containing several young serpents, all of which 
he, with a little assistance, instantly killed and devoured. 

Extract from the Hon. and Rev. C. Bathursfs Letter to Dr. 
Chalmers; dated Siddington, near Cirencester, Nov. 5. 1833. — 
" Lord Bathurst's park, &c., is two miles from this place, and 
in his woods, near the keeper's house, peacocks are kept as 
ornaments to the wild scenery, but not, as far as I have ever 
heard, or, even since reading your paper, been able to learn, 
for the purpose of destroying serpents. I do not make out 
that they are esteemed ' in this part of the country, the 
natural enemy of the serpent tribe ; ' neither do I see, in any 
of the works of natural history which I have consulted since 
reading your article, that this peculiarity has been noticed. 
Among ancient naturalists, Aristotle and Pliny say not a word 
on that subject ; BufFon and Bewick, you say, do not mention 
this peculiarity, so I have not consulted them; but I have^ 
looked into Goldsmith and Blumenbach, but find it not there

either. However, it may not be uninteresting to you, as in a 
great measure connected with your subject, to mention a cir- 
cumstance which recently came to my knowledge. My friend, 
Sir John Ogilvy, who has lately been staying with us, told me 
that, last year, when riding at Halnaker Park, in Sussex, he 
saw a pheasant with a long thin substance in its beak, and, 
upon his making towards the bird, he flew off and dropped 
his prey, which turned out to be a slowworm or blindworm 
(^^nguis fragilis). The pheasant has, by this anecdote, been 
proved to prey on serpents ; and, if it be true of the pheasant, 
why should it not be true of the peacock, for they are both 
species of the same order, Gallinae?" 

Some of the Habits and Anatomical Conditions of a Pair of 
hybrid Birds, obtained from the Union of a Male Pheasant 
with He?is of the Bantam Fowl; and an incidental Notice of a 
hybrid Dove. — Sir, I send you a few particulars relating to 
the habits of a handsome pair of hybrid birds lately pre- 
sented to the Cambridge Philosophical Society by my father, 
J. P. Henslow, Esq., who furnished me with these details 
from his personal observations. I shall also subjoin a few 
anatomical remarks upon them, which were forwarded to me 
by Mr. Leadbeater; who stuffed the specimens for us, and 
who had sent the bodies, divested of their skins, to an ana- 
tomical friend for examination. I am, Sir, yours, &c. — 
J,S. Henslow. Cambridge, Apinl 8. 1833. 

J. P. Henslow^s Account of their Habits, — After having 
been several years disappointed in obtaining hybrids from the 
pheasant and common fowl [adults], I procured a brace of 
young pheasants, a cock and hen. These were brought up 
with four young smooth-legged hen bantams of the same age, 
in an enclosure of about 30 ft. by 10 ft. 1 purposely confined 
them in this small space, to create familiarity,which was effected; 
and the hen pheasant, the succeeding summer, laid many 
eggs, about one dozen of which proved good ; the bantams 
also laid, and about eighteen of their eggs proved good. The 
hybrids produced from these eggs were thriving, when a 
thunder-storm destroyed one halfj and a cat killed all the 
remainder, except the two now sent to the Society. These 
were reared, and they proved to be a cock and a hen. In the 
succeeding summer (1829), the hen showed inclination to sit; 
but as the cock did so likewise, which seemed to disturb her, 
I removed her to a separate shed ; and she took to a nest of 
eleven eggs, which I put for her in a corner ; but, from what 
cause 1 know not, none of these eggs were hatched. Pre- 
viously to the next summer (1830), I provided them a small 
enclosure ; and, when I perceived the same inclination to sit, 



154' Short Communications: — 

I supplied them with straw and eleven bantam's eggs. The 
hen sat closely ; as also did the cock at times, which, I sus- 
pect, disturbed her. One chicken, however, was hatched, 
which they reared with most sedulous attention ; particularly 
the cock, who called and accompanied it for some time after 
the hen had apparently neglected it. I again put eggs to 
them in 1831, and they both sat; but none were hatched. 
The hen moulted badly, and drooped till January, 1832, 
when she died ; and I then had the cock killed. It is worthy 
of remark that these birds evinced at least as strong attach- 
ment to the chicken which they reared as the real parent 
would have done ; though they never showed any regard for 
each other, as most of the hybrids, however, that I have kept 
have done. When the chicken was about a month old, I 
entered their place ; when they both flew at me violently, the 
cock, especially, attempting to attack my face. 

Hybrid Dove, — In the same case with these hybrids is 
a hybrid dove, from between a cock turtle dove and a hen 
ringneck (the common West Indian cream-coloured species). 
This hybrid, which is a male, has associated for three years 
with a hen ringneck, which has laid many eggs, and regularly 
sat on them, and been duly relieved in this office by her 
hybrid mate, but without effect. 

Extract from the Anatomical Remarks foi^isoarded through 
Mr. Leadbeater, — " In the examination of the two hybrid 
birds which you were so kind as to send me, the following 
appearances were observed : — One of them, which proved 
to be a male, had the muscles of the body in a healthy, 
plump, full condition, with very little fat in the intervening 
cellular membrane. The muscles of the other, which was a 
female, were extremely emaciated, of an unhealthy character, 
and the cellular membrane loaded with fat. In the latter 
bird, two small bodies of a dark colour were observed on 
each side of the spine, in the situation of the ovarium : they 
were smooth, and of a uniform appearance externally, pos- 
sessing very few of the characters of the healthy ovarium. 
The two oviducts reached nearly the whole length of the 
lateral parts of the abdomen, that of the left side being the 
longest. On making a small opening into the right oviduct, 
and inflating it, this was found to terminate in a cut de sac 
by the side of the rectum ; the loose abdominal extremity 
being curved upon itself, having an aperture at the end, of 
the size of a bristle, which allowed mercury to pass through 
it. The abdominal extremity of the other oviduct was simi- 
lar; and the anal also had most probably terminated, like 
them, in a blind pouch, but an opening had been accidentally 



Birds, 1 55 

made into it : it was very clear that it did not open into the 
gut or cloaca. A small pyramidal cavity existed at the back 
part of the rectum, into which neither of the oviducts opened, 
although they passed close to the sides of the gut. The lower 
part of the rectum was not at all enlarged, i. e. into the form 
of a cloaca ; nor were there any openings into it except those 
of the ureters. The testes of the male bird were small, 
white, and of a healthy appearance : a vas deferens was clearly 
to be seen running from them over the surface of each kid- 
ney. Into one vas defei'ens a mercurial tube was placed, and 
it allowed the quicksilver to pass readily. The margin of the 
anus, with some of the rectum, having been removed, the 
quicksilver escaped at the cut extremity of the duct, so that 
it was impossible to ascertain in what manner it terminated. 
Osseous fibres existed in the muscles and tendons of the legs 
of both birds." 

Habits of the Hoopoe (\J^pupa ^pops L.), as observed near 
Bordeaux, — On the Bordeaux side of the Garonne, and near 
the city, are large spaces of marshy ground, intersected by 
broad ditches and creeks terminating in the river; where, 
from the advantage derived from the water, many poplars 
and willows are planted for the sake of the twigs, which are 
much used for tying vines. These trees being topped at 
about 10 ft. or 12 ft. from the ground, so as to induce them 
to sprout much, become very thick, and, in the course of a 
few years, gradually decaying at the centre, are attacked by 
numerous tribes of insects, particularly the jet ant (JFbrmica 
fuliginosa). In these retired places, which are frequented 
only by a few cowherds and country people, the hoopoe, 
which is a very shy bird, may be frequently observed examin- 
ing the rotten wood, and feeding on the insects with which it 
abounds. The hoopoe flies low and seldom, unless when 
disturbed, its food being so abundant as to require little 
search ; it remains the whole year ; and breeds in a hollow 
willow, about the end of May, laying two eggs of a cinereous 
or ash colour. The young come out in June ; but I could 
not ascertain the exact time required for hatching. This 
bird is occasionally, though rarely, met with in England, 
generally late in the autumn ; and, I believe, has never been 
known to breed in England, though it probably does with 
some of our northern neighbours : and its occasional visits to 
us may be in the way of its autumnal migrations thence. —

[Instances of the occurrence of the hoopoe in Britain are 
registered in II. 395., IV. 163., V. 569., VI. 150. Sir Wm. 
Jardine, in his notes to White's Selborne, states that the 
figure of the hoopoe, published in Selby's Illtist. of Orti,, is

and Dr. Latham records that a young hoopoe was shot in 
the month of June. The species is abundantly met with in 
the south of Europe; it also occurs in Holland, Germany, 
Denmark, and Sweden. In the winter it retires to Asia and 
Africa, where it is also a permanent resident." Mr. Blyth 
has recorded, in the Field Naturalist for January, ii. 53., that 
in the summer of 1833 a pair of hoopoes frequented a garden 
in the neighbourhood of Tooting, Surrey. — J. Z).] 

The Fern Owl, its time of Migration. (V. 674.) — The fol-

1833, English style: — '' Tell W that whilst we were in 

the North Sea" (the date must have been 9th or 10th June), 
'' two fern owls settled on the main-topmast-stay, the only 
instance I have ever heard of these birds settling on a vessel. 
I shot one ; its crop was empty, and it appeared quite ex- 
hausted : the other got away. If I were at home, I would 
tell Mr. Loudon about it: he can do as he likes. They were 
most likely on their way from Norway to Lincolnshire, as we 
were then about 120 miles abreast of that county." I have 
followed my directions in communicating the above, as it will 
satisfy a correspondent in V. 674. ; but I regret that the tra- 
veller should have so cruelly divorced the poor birds. —

nest and eggs of the hawfinch. T. F.'s description, in I.

A Pair of Redbreasts built a Nest late in November, 1833, in 
a rather exposed hole in the northern side of a garden wall 
in this town. By early in December, five eggs were laid; 
bnt some boys, who had discovered the nest, caused the birds 
to forsake it. The nest and eggs were removed on Dec. 20., 
when, of the eggs, two that were accidentally broken, showed 
a state of progress towards the formation of young. I have 
the three unbroken eggs. A nest of young redbreasts in 
winter would be rare indeed, but the past season has been 
extraordinarily mild. — 2\ G. Chipimig Nmton, Oxfordshire,

Reptiles. — A Tortoise forelcno'ws the relative Coldness of a 
coming Wi?iter, and foreshows the Degree by the Depth to 
which it buries itself i7i the Earth. — I have a tortoise; I was 
going to say an old tortoise, but I know nothing about his 
age. I have had him about nine years. He was given to 
me by an old gentleman, who had possessed him at least 
twjenty years, and who had received him from another old 
gentleman who had possessed him for many years previously, 
but who gave him away because he used to eat young let- 
tuces. Neither this person nor the gentleman who gave 
him me knew any thing about his age ; so it is not probable 
that I should. Every winter, this tortoise buries himself in 
the earth ; and, knowing better than Mr. Squire or Moore's 
Almanack what sort of a winter we are going to have, the 
colder the winter is going to be, the deeper he goes. Well, 
Sir, last winter [1832] the top of his shell was only covered 
two inches. There were, if you recollect, only two nights 
that could be really called frosty; and now his shell is only 
just level with the earth, the very top of it being visible 
through the turf. Argal, we shall have no frost at all. —

This foretelling arrived too late for publication in the 
Number for January, 1834. E. N. D. has, on February 2., 
informed us that " the tortoise, on January 17. 1834, emerged 
from his hiding-place, and walked about as in summer." 

A Tortoise inhabits the Aquarium of the Botanic Garden at 
Cambridge ; and as this [it is possible) may eventually be- 
come as venerable as the tortoise above, and, like it, the hero 
of a tale, a timely registration of some facts in the history 
of its younger days may avail its future biographer. This 
tortoise was once my father's, who has, at my request, sup- 
plied most of the following facts respecting it. — J. D. 

The tortoise was given me in the end of May, 1828, by 
your aunt, L. Cross, to whom it had been given by her son, 
E. Cross, who had brought it, with five other tortoises, from 



158 Short Commtinications ; — 

the coast of Malaga in Spain, where he picked them up off 
the sands. Your aunt must have received it in the autumn of 
1826 or ] 827, because she says that during the winter it used 
to get under the grate. She used to put water or milk, with 
soaked bread, in a plate for it ; but it is not certain that she 
ever saw it take any thing. When I had received it, I, not 
knowing better, treated it as a land tortoise. I put it, in the 
day time, into the front garden (which is, from its aspect, the 
warmer one), but, contrary to my expectation, I could not 
perceive it take any vegetable food. I afterwards put it in 
the back yard, whence it several times made its escape ; and 
one day we considered we had lost it, until our dog traced it 
to the pond in the yard, and assisted in the capture of it. We 
then bored a hole in its shell, tied thereto a string, and to the 
same string, at about a yard from the shell, fastened a float, 
that we might capture the creature at any time. We regu- 
larly, in an evening, brought it in-doors and put it in a basket. 
When liberated, in the morning, it directly sought the pond : 
so that, after we had half-starved it, it had found its element. 
It was in the water that we first saw him feed on some 
small pieces of lights which your mother threw into the 
pond for it. Afterwards it became so familiar as to eat out 
of your mother's and sister's hands (it seemed to show an aver- 
sion from men), and by its more healthy appearance, the 
quickness of its motions [and it would, when obstructed in 
front, travel backwards almost as fast as forwards], and by its 
getting frequently out of the water upon a stone at the pond's 
edge, to bask there in the heat of the sun, showed that it 
enjoyed its existence. When winter approached, it was less 
anxious to leave its basket. We then wrapped it up, and 
placed it in its basket, in a warm situation, until the spring. 
After keeping it through a part of the summer [of 1829], I 
made a present of it to Mr. Arthur Biggs, the curator of the 
Cambridge Botanic Garden, and took off its float, and put it 
into the sheet of water [supplied by a slow stream that passes 
through it], in which the aquatic plants are cultivated. Here 
it gets its own living, and has remained, to the best of 
Mr. Biggs's, and Mr. Scott the foreman's, knowledge, during 
four winters. [The length of time which it remains wholly 
unapparent (wherever it may hide) is not many weeks. Its 
first appearance, in 1833, was on April 2.] In warm weather, 
in the heat of the day, it either enjoys itself by sunning itself 
on a stone step at one end of the water, or on the grass at 
the edge of the water, or, when the water is low, on the 
narrow beach which intervenes the water and the grass. 
From this place it, on the approach of any one, hastens into 



Fishes, Molluscous Animals, 159 

the water, and has convenient hiding-places amongst the 
aquatic plants, and especially amongst and under the ample 
leaves of the water lilies (iVymphse a alba L, and iVuphar 
advena H, K.\ and occasionally it floats stationary on the sur- 
face of the water, as it were in the manner in which fishes, in 
slow streams, are, in hot sunny weather, said to sleep. It has 
increased in size considerably, and appears very healthy. 
Mr. Scott has told me, that once [in April or May, 1832] it 
travelled to near the Free School Lane entrance to the 
garden; a distance of, perhaps, 150 yards from the water, 
— possibly in search of a mate. 

These facts prove that this species of tortoise will live in 
any reservoir of water, like that in the Cambridge Botanic 
Garden ; and they may, especially if the amount of them is not 
already well known, promote endeavours to naturalise many 
individuals of this and other species of aquatic tortoises in 
similar situations, where they could not fail to be interesting 
objects to lovers of nature. — J, D, sen. 

A young Land To?ioise, once kept in a cool green-house in 
a private garden at Bury St. Edmunds, lost its life by 
attempting to ascend a tall stone step placed at the threshold 
inside the entrance door. It fell backwards ; and the con- 
vexity of its shell was such, or the animal's weakness (for I 
suspect that it had been but very negligently fed) was such, 
that it could not apply its feet to the floor to lever itself into 
its natural position. It was found lying on its back, dead, 
and with froth at its mouth. — J. D.

I found a large irregular-shaped apparently solid mass of

full \\u. high. It struck me as being an awkward encum- 
brance for the animal, and I was puzzled, as neither dint nor

fracture was observable on the exterior of the shell, to ascer- 
tain the cause ; but, on breaking a small portion of the irre- 
gular mass, discovered it. The animal had, by some accident, 
got a large mass of mud between itself and the shell, and not 
having the power of dislodging the mud, and probably finding 
the roughness of it disagreeable to the smooth surface of its 
own body, had formed a coating of pearly matter entirely over 
it, and had thus sagaciously rendered it, though it must have 
been a great encumbrance, as little inconvenient to itself as 
possible. — Id,

near Southampton, where even the youngest 
shells have the fractured apex. Will Mr. Kenyon, 
who (in his list of land and freshwater shells in II. 273.) men- 
tions it under the name of Lymnse^a leucostoma, oblige me

the Zoological Journal, my attention was attracted by some 
figures in the 4th plate, and, on referring to the descriptions 
I found, in page 122., " A Memoir on Achlysia, a new Genus 
of Trachean Arachnides, by M. J. V. Audouin." 

Some years back, I carefully examined a specimen of 
Z)ytiscus marginalis L., under the wings of which, and 
attached to its back, were above a dozen bags, each rather 
smaller than a grain of wheat, curved and narrowed at the 
end by which they were attached. On opening these sacs, 
I found, to my astonishment, that each contained a perfect 
animal, which I believe may be a Hydrachna, or rather 
Limnocharis Latr, As there is nothing new under the sun, 
I did not at the time regard this discovery, and lost my 
descriptions and drawings, which I now very much regret, 
as it renders my present communication very imperfect ; but, 
I hope, even this notice may be the means of calling the 
attention of some one to the subject better acquainted with 
the Trachearia than I am.

From the learned observations of M. Audouin on this 
class, it must have happened that the animals in the sacs which 
he examined, and has called Achlysia, were in an early stage 
of growth ; so that he had no opportunity of ascertaining what 
I, under more favourable circumstances, discovered. 

Whether the metamorphoses of the Hydrachnadse be 
known, I am not aware; but it will be very remarkable 
should they be parasitic in their different states; and it struck 
me, at first, as an extraordinary fact, that these animals 
should remain in their sacs attached to the Z)ytiscus by 
their rostrum, when they are matured, and have eight per- 
fect legs for use. I believe the Limnochares are not uncom- 
mon in ponds and ditches, and are supposed to feed upon 
animalcula, &c. De Geer mentions, I believe, that the eggs 
of a Hydrachna are attached to, and receive nourishment from, 
one of the water fleas {Gy rinus Lin.). — J. Curtis. 57. Upper 
Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, Nov. 16. 1833. [To Achlysia 
Dytisci Aud. the text and figures in Zool, Journ, ascribe 
only six legs.] 

Chelifer cancroides. (V. 754.) — I have often taken this 
odd little creature, and other species of Chelifer, attached to 
the legs of Jfusca domestica, M. meteorica, and M, larva- 
rum. I have observed them attached to flies, most frequently 
in hot weather ; but they are to be found, at almost any time, 
under the bark of trees, under stones, and amongst moss in 
dryish banks. The C. cancroides is known to live in old 
drawers and closets, and amongst old books. It is undoubt- 
edly, at times, a parasitical creature ; but not generally. 
They attach to the legs of flies by one of their curious pin- 
cers ; but I have never seen them so attached as to lead me to 
believe that they derived nourishment from the flies. They 
feed, no doubt, in their usual habitats, on minute insects. — 
W, B. B. W. Nov. 14. 1832. 

Chelifer cancroides. (V. 754.) — A fly (Musca domestica) 
was yesterday produced to me, to one of whose legs were 
affixed four specimens of Chelifer rancroides. If this new 
instance can be called accidental, I am at a loss to conceive 
how so many enemies (as they doubtless are to its tribe) 
had attached themselves to one limb ? If the fly had acci- 
dentally placed the limb in a nest of these insects, it seems na- 
tural to believe that it would have had sufficient sensibility to 
withdraw it ere the whole family had time to attach themselves. 
At present, the most probable reason which can be advanced 
is, that the fly was asleep at the time. I have to regret that 
a tender-hearted and fearful boy in the room should have 
stopped all further investigation on this interesting instance,

along the slope of the Shade Mountain, in Juniata Valley, has 
materially enlarged my knowledge of the geological position of 
this fossil. On the banks of the Pennsylvania canal, near Lewis- 
town*, the strata consist of numerous seams from 1 in. to 
lift, thick, of argillaceous sandstone, more or less ferruginous, 
and varying in colour from dark brown to greenish blue. These 
are quarried in large slabs for the purposes of paving and 
building. The surfaces of these slabs are covered with i^uci 
in relief, whose forms are ill defined, and are smaller than the 
Fucoides alleghaniensis ; they are also separated by courses 
of soft argillaceous rock, from ^ in. to 1 in. in thickness, con- 
sisting almost entirely of similar i^uci. An opening, made 
into another part of the series, at a lower position, and at the 
distance of half a mile, exhibited no fewer than a hundred suc- 
cessive courses of these vegetable deposits upon similar rock, 
within a section of only 20 ft. perpendicular. All these fossil 
beds comprise the same undefined Fucoides, occasionally tra- 
versed by the larger species. I traced a succession of these 
beds to upwards of 200 ft. elevation. At the height of full 
350 ft., the Fucoides alleghaniensis prevailed in abundance 
upon slabs of brown red sandstone, and probably extended 
50 ft. higher. The whole series, therefore, which contains 
fossil Fuci occupies a thickness of from 250 ft. to 400 ft.

Seven Mountains, at the distance of 15 miles west of the 
Shade Mountain just noticed, the Fucoides alleghaniensis 
appears on the surface of white sandstone strata, occupying a 
mile in breadth, and rising to the height of 1000 ft.

Remarks i7i Defence of \_Mr. Audubon] the Author of the 
" \_Biography of the] Birds of America " [VII. 66,]^ by the 
Rev. John Bachman^ Charleston^ South Carolina. — Although, 
from my profession and habits, I feel no disposition to enter 
into controversy, yet, having had opportunities which few- 
others possess of becoming acquainted with the occupations 
and literary acquirements of Mr. Audubon, and being 
prompted, not alone by feelings of private friendship, but by 
a desire that full justice should be awarded him for those ex- 
penses, sacrifices, and privations which he has undergone, I 
take the liberty of stating what I know on this subject ; and I 
have reason to believe, from the characters of the writers who 
have doubted his veracity and the authenticity of his works, 
that, with the generosity of feeling so distinctive of those who 
are engaged in liberal and kindred pursuits, they will be gra- 
tified to assign him the meed of praise which he so undoubt- 
edly merits. 

It appears that exception has been taken to two publica- 
tions of Audubon's ; one on the habits of the rattlesnake, and 
the other on the habits of the turkey buzzard (Cathartes Aura). 
The latter publication is now lying before me ; the former I 
have not had an opportunity of seeing; but, from what I 
gather from some communications in [this] Journal, it appears 
that he ascribed to the rattlesnake some of the habits of the 
common black snake (Coluber constrictor Lin.), as ascending 
trees in search of game, feeding on squirrels, &c. He also 
mentioned the remarkable fact, of their living a considerable 
length of time in confinement without food. 

[Here follows, in the manuscript, an extract of some length 
from Featherstonehaugh's Monthly American Jour?ial of Geo- 
logy and the Natural Sciences, Nov. 1831, p. 221. (the commu- 
nication to that work to which Mr. Audubon, jun., has, in our 
VI. 551., referred), and a variety of evidence from Dr. Cooper, 
Dr. Leitner, Dr. Randolph, and Mr. Hockley ; the amount 
of which is, that " at least five well-defined species of rattle- 
snake are now found in this extensive country ; " that rattle- 
snakes, of one or other species, climb and have been seen on 
fences, and on trees, and on bushes, and that one has been

seen coiled up and at rest, in the fork of a tree, at about 
8ft. from the ground; that " the rattlesnake sometimes 
takes to the water, and is found a considerable distance 
from the shore in salt water ;" that the rattlesnake, in its native 
woods, feeds on squirrels ; even, occasionally, on the largest 
American squirrel (5ciurus fulpinus), rabbits (Zvepus ameri- 
canus), and also rats (Arvicola floridana Ord, and, from the 
wording of the manuscript, probably other species of rat); 
and that, with regard to the means by which rattlesnakes cap- 
ture these animals, it is possible that " rattlesnakes may yet be 
discovered to be nocturnal in their habits ; possessing a degree 
of activity at night which is not exhibited by day, unless hard 
pressed by hunger." As this communication is professedly 
in reply to Mr. Waterton, who has, in VII. 67., line 8. and 7. 
from the bottom, observed that *' nobody doubts that rattle- 
snakes swallow squirrels," it is needless to occupy space to 
confirm an at^sertion which Mr. Waterton has not disputed. 
The Rev. J. Bachman states that he had not seen a later 
number of this Magazine than the one for Sept. 1833. The 
MS. will be returned to the party through which it reached us, 
to be published elsewhere, entire, if our elision dissatisfies.] 

With regard to the experiments of Audubon on the powers 
of smeUing, usually ascribed to the turkey buzzard (C. Aura) 
[VI. 84. 163.], I acknowledge that he has adopted views op- 
posed to the long established opinions of naturalists. But no 
one who will read his paper on the subject, containing a full 
detail of a number of experiments on the habits of this vulture, 
can deny that, if he intended to deceive the world, he cer- 
tainly chose a subject where detection was easy and certain. 
In our southern cities, these birds, with their kindred species 
Cathartes atratus, are so abundant in our streets and on our 
house-tops, as to have become a nuisance. It is but due to 
Mr. Audubon to state, that, in his frequent visits to this city, 
he has fearlessly invited investigation on this subject. During 
his absence, he has written to me on several occasions, urging 
me to make farther experiments. A number of engagements 
prevented me from devoting as much time to the subject as 
was necessary to investigate it in such a manner as to prove 
satisfactory to my mind, and I postponed it to a more leisure 
period. On the recent visit, however, of Mr. Audubon to 
this city, I consented to institute these enquiries ; in the pro- 
secution of which I was aided by the intelligence and expe- 
rience of such disinterested naturalists and men of science as 
could be obtained. 

On the 16th of December, I commenced a series of expe- 
riments on the habits of the vultures (C. Aura and C. atratus) ; 

M 3 



166 Betrospective Criticism, 

particularly as regards their powers of smell and sight, which 
were continued, with little intermission, till the 31st. Written 
invitations were sent to all the professors of the two medical 
colleges in this city, to the officers and some of the members 
of the Philosophical Society, and such other individuals as we 
believed might take an interest in the subject. Although 
Mr. Audubon was present during most of this time, and was 
willing to render any assistance required of him, yet he 
desired that we might make the experiments ourselves, that 
we might adopt any mode that the ingenuity or experience of 
others could suggest in arriving at the most correct conclu- 
sions. The manner in which these experiments were made, 
together with the result, I now proceed to detail. 

There were three points on which the veracity of Mr. Au- 
dubon had been assailed : first, whether the vulture is grega- 
rious ; secondly, whether he feeds on fresh as well as putrid 
flesh; thirdly, whether he is attracted to his food by the eye 
or the scent ? To these queries, not only in justice to the 
American ornithologist, but to aid the cause of natural science, 
our enquiries were directed. First, whether the vultures of 
this country are gregarious ? — That vultures, during the 
breeding season, and occasionally at other times, fly singly, is 
well known ; but such is also the case with all our birds that 
usually keep in flocks ; witness the wild pigeon (Columba 
migratoria) and the robin ( Turdus migrat^rius), and many of 
our water birds. But that our vultures are gregarious, in the 
true sense of the word, is a fact well established. In most 
cases, in the interior of our state, as well as in the environs of 
this city, considerable numbers are found in company, from 
three or four to forty or fifty. They hunt for their prey in 
company ; they feed together on the same carrion ; they per- 
form their gyrations in great numbers together, and they roost 
together. I have visited their roosting-places ; a sight well 
worth travelling many miles to observe. In some deep swamp, 
or occasionally in high ground, surrounded by a thicket 
of vines and thorny shrubs, usually composed of %izyphus 
volubilis, and several species of ^milax and .Rubus, the 
buzzards resort for years together to spend their nights. 
Here, on some dead tree, and frequently on several that may 
be standing near each other, they are crowded so close to- 
gether that one or two hundred may be counted on a tree, and 
frequently thirty or forty on a single branch. The ground 
and bushes, within a certain extent, are covered with the ex- 
crements ; which, by their acridity, have destroyed the whole 
undergrowth of shrubs and plants and every blade of grass ; 
so that the surface presents an appearance of having received 
several thick coatings of whitewash. 



Retrospective Criticism, 167 

Secondly, whether our vultures subsist on fresh as well as 
putrid food? — On this head it was unnecessary to make 
experiments ; it being a subject with which even the most 
casual observer amongst us is well acquainted. It is well 
known that the roof of our market-house is covered with these 
birds early every morning, waiting for any little scrap of 
fresh meat that may be thrown to them by the butchers. At 
our slaughter-houses, the offal is quickly devoured by our 
vultures, whilst it is yet warm from the recent death of the 
slaughtered animal. I have seen the Fiiltur Aura a hundred 
miles in the interior of this country, where he may be said to 
be altogether in a state of nature, regaling himself on the en- 
trails of a deer, which had been killed not an hour before. Two 
years ago, Mr. H. Ward, who is now in London, and who 
was in the employ of the Philosophical Society of this city, 
was in the habit of depositing, at the foot of my garden (in 
the suburbs of Charleston) the fresh carcasses of the birds he 
had skinned, and in the course of half an hour both species 
of vulture, particularly the Cathartes Aura, came and devoured 
the whole. Nay, we discovered that vultures fed on the 
bodies of those of their own species that had been thus 
exposed. A few days ago, a vulture that had been killed by 
some boys in the neighbourhood, and had fallen near the 
place where we were performing our experiments, attracted, 
on the following morning, the sight of a Cathartes Aura, which 
commenced pulling off its feathers and feeding upon it. This 
brought down two of the black vultures, who joined in the 
repast. In this instance, the former chased away the two 
latter to some distance; an unusual occurrence, as the black 
vulture is the stronger bird, and generally keeps off the 
other species. We had the dead bird covered with some 
rice chaff, where it still remains undiscovered by the vultures. 

Thirdly, whether is the vulture attracted to its food by the 
sense of smell or of sight ? — A number of experiments were 
tried, to satisfy us on this head, and all led to the same re- 
sult. A few of these I shall detail. 

1. A dead hare (Z/cpus timidus), a pheasant (Phasianus 
colchicus), a kestrel (Falco TinnunculusZ/.), from a recent im- 
portation, together with a wheelbarrowful of offal from the 
slaughter-pens, were deposited on the ground, in a retired 
situation at the foot of my garden. A frame was raised above 
it, at the distance of twelve inches from the earth. This was 
covered with brushwood, allowing the air to pass freely 
beneath it, so as to convey the effluvia far and wide; and 
although fifteen days have now gone by, and the flesh has 
become offensive, not a single vulture appears to have per- 

M 4 



168 Retrospective Criticism, 

ceived it, though hundreds have passed over it, and some 
very near it, in search of their daily food. Although the 
vultures did not discover this dainty mess, the dogs in the 
vicinity, who appeared to have better olfactory nerves, fre- 
quently visited the place, and gave us much trouble in the 
prosecution of our experiments. 

2. I now suggested an experiment which would enable us 
to test the enquiry, whether the vulture could be^attracted to 
an object by tne sight alone. A coarse painting on canvass 
was made, representing a sheep skinned and cut open. This 
proved very amusing. No sooner was this picture placed on 
the ground, than the vultures observed it, alighted near, 
walked over it, and some of them commenced tugging at the 
painting. They seemed much disappointed and surprised ; 
and, after having satisfied their curiosity, flew away. This 
experiment was repeated more than fifty times, with the same 
result. The painting was then placed within 10 ft. of the spot 
where our offal was deposited. They came, as before ; walked 
around it, but in no instance evinced the slightest symptom 
of their having scented the offal which was so near them. 

3. The most offensive portions of the offal were now placed 
on the earth ; these were covered over by a thin canvass cloth ; 
on this was strewed several small pieces of fresh beef. The 
vultures came, ate the flesh that was in sight, and, although 
they were standing upon a quantity beneath them, and though 
their bills were frequently within the one eighth of an inch of this 
putrid matter, they did not discover it. We made a small rent 
in the canvass, and they at once perceived the flesh, and began 
to devour it. We drove them away, replaced the canvass 
with an entire piece, and again they commenced eating the 
fresh pieces of flesh exhibited to their view, without disco- 
vering the hidden food they were treading upon. 

4. The medical gentlemen who were present, now made a 
number of experiments, to attest the absurdity of a story, 
widely circulated in the United States through the news- 
papers, that the eye of a vulture, when perforated, and the 
sight extinguished, would, in a few moments, be restored, in 
consequence of his placing his head under his wing ; the 
down of which was said to restore the sight. The eyes were 
perforated : I need not add, that the bird became blind, and 
that it was beyond the power of the healing art to restore his 
lost sight. His life was, however, preserved by occasionally 
putting food in his mouth. In this situation, they placed him 
in a small out-house ; hung the flesh of the hare, that had 
now become offensive, within his reach ; nay, they frequently 
placed it within an inch of his nostrils ; but the bird gave no 



JRetrospective Criticism, 169 

evidence of any knowledge that his favourite food was so near 
him. This was repeated for several days in succession, with 
the same results. 

I did not consider this last experiment as conclusive as 
others did who witnessed it. The bird might not have been 
wholly free from the pain inflicted by the operation, nor 
might he have been so soon reconciled to the new situation 
into which he had been thrown by the loss of sight ; but, in 
connection with other experiments, it strengthened us in the 
opinions we had formed. 

After having resorted to the means detailed above, to 
satisfy myself of the accuracy of the statements of Audubon 
as regards the habits of the turkey buzzard, detailed in Jame- 
son's Journal [for October and December, 1826], I once more 
carefully read over his remarks on the subject ; and I now 
feel bound to declare that every statement contained in that 
communication is in accordance with my own experience, 
after a residence of twenty years in a country where the vul- 
tures are more abundant than any other birds. 

We were not aware that any other experiments could be 
made to enable us to arrive at more satisfactory results, and, 
as we feared, if continued, they might become offensive to the 
neighbours, we abandoned them. 

As my humble name can scarcely be known in Europe, I 
have thought proper to obtain the signatures of some of the 
gentlemen who aided me in, or witnessed, these experiments ; 
and I must also add that there was not an individual, among 
the crowd of persons who came to judge for themselves, who 
did not coincide with those who have given their names to 
this certificate. 

" We, the subscribers, having witnessed several of the 
experiments made on the habits of the vultures of Carolina 
(Cathartes Aura and Cathartes atratus), commonly called the 
turkey buzzard and carrion crow, feel assured that these species 
respectively are gregarious ; the individuals of each species 
associating and feeding together ; that they devour fresh as 
well as putrid food of any kind, and that they are guided to 
their food altogether through their sense of sight, and not 
that of smell.

170 Retrospective Criticism, 

It now remains for naturalists to account for the errors 
which have, for so many ages, existed with regard to the 
power of scent ascribed to our vultures. Indeed, it is highly 
probable that facts elicited from the experiments of Audubon 
on our two species of vulture, strengthened by those insti- 
tuted on this occasion, may apply to all the rest of the genus. 
Without having had many opportunities of observation, I am 
inclined to doubt the extraordinary powers of smell ascribed 
to the condor of the Andes (C. Gryphus), and it would be 
advisable to make farther experiments on the vultures of 
southern Europe and Africa. Perhaps it may yet be dis- 
covered that all the birds belonging to this genus are alto- 
gether indebted to the eye in their search after food. Indeed, 
I am of opinion, that, while to quadrupeds (particularly car- 
nivorous ones) the faculty of scent is their peculiar province, 
this organ is but imperfectly developed in birds. As it does, 
however, exist, although in an inferior degree, I am not dis- 
posed to deny to birds the power of smell altogether ; nor 
would I wish to advance the opinion that the vulture does not 
possess the faculty of smelling in the slightest degree, although 
it has not been discovered by our experiments. All that I 
contend for is, that he is not assisted by this faculty in pro- 
curing his food : that he cannot smell better, for instance, 
than hawks or owls, which, it is known, are indebted to their 
sight altogether in discovering their prey. If our vultures 
had to depend on their olfactory powers alone in procuring 
food, what would become of them in cold winters ; in Ken- 
tucky, for instance, where they remain all the year, and where 
the earth is bound up with frost for months at a time, and 
where, consequently, during that period, putrefaction does 
not take place : and, if they had to depend alone on tainted 
meat for food, how soon wovdd the whole race (at least, in our 
temperate climates) die of hunger ? 

How easily error may be perpetuated, from age to age, we 
may learn from a thousand other visionary notions, which the 
more careful observations of recent travellers and naturalists 
have exploded. At this day, the belief is very general in this 
country, that, immediately after a deer (Cervus virginianus) 
has been killed, the vultures, at the distance of many miles, 
are seen coming in a direct line against the wind, scenting 
the slaughtered animal. This may be accounted for, with a 
little observation, upon rational principles. When a deer is 
killed, the entrails are immediately taken out ; these, or per- 
haps the blood which covers the earth to some distance, are 
seen by some passing bird. He directly commences sailing 
around the neighbourhood ; he is observed by those at a dis- 



JRetrospective Criticism, 17I 

tance ; the peculiar motions of his wings, well known to those 
of his own species, communicate to them the intelligence 
that something good for them is perceived. These, hastening 
to the place, give information to those who are still farther 
off; and, in the course of an hour, a very great number are 
guided to the spot. But it will scarcely be argued that this 
great concourse of vultures has been attracted by the effluvia 
of putrid flesh, since the animal has been killed but an hour 
before. 

I come now to notice the most important enquiry, and one 
which has been my principal inducement in taxing the pages 
of [this] Journal, and the patience of [its] readers, with this 
communication. Whether Audubon is the real author of the 
book called Ornithological Biography. Probably this ques- 
tion is already settled in Europe ; as his original manuscripts 
are there, to which many of his friends have had access. 
The September Number of this Magazine is the latest that 
has been received in this part of America : perhaps [the] 
subsequent Numbers may have shown that this voice from 
his native land was unnecessary to establish a fact already 
placed beyond the reach of suspicion. [The additional com- 
munications on the matter occur in VI. 550., VII. 66.'] Be 
this as it may, I am unwilling that the lukewarmness or 
the confidence of his friends should deprive this enterprising 
ornithologist of the reputation which he has so laboriously 
acquired. No naturalist in this country has ever bestowed 
so much of his time, industry, and wealth, or made so many 
sacrifices to a favourite pursuit, as he has done. To this he 
has devoted the most active portion of his life ; to accomplish 
this, he has traversed the whole of this wide-extended country, 
from the Atlantic to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains ; 
from the swamps of Florida and Louisiana to the snows of 
Michigan and the rugged rocks of Labrador. 

For the last two years and a half, I have been intimately 
acquainted with Audubon : he has resided in my family for 
months in succession. From a similarity of disposition and 
pursuits, he was my companion in my rambles through the 
woods and fields, and the enlivener of my evening hours. 
During his absence, we were constant correspondents ; and 
his letters, amounting to nearly a hundred, are now lying 
before me. His journals have been regularly submitted to 
my inspection; his notes and observations were made in my 
presence ; and a considerable portion of the second volume 
of his Ornithological Biography was written under my roof. 
I have carefully compared his first volume with the forth- 
coming one ; and, from all these opportunities which I have 



172 Retrospective Criticism. 

enjoyed of making a decision, I do not hesitate to state that 
Audubon is the author of the book to which his name is 
attached ; and that the second volume will not fall short of 
the first in purity, vigour, and originality of style ; and that 
it will contain the additional experience and observation of 
three of the most active years of his life. 

Some details of the habits and pursuits of this gentleman 
may not be uninteresting to your readers, and will account for 
the manner in which he has been enabled successfully to 
carry on so large, expensive, and laborious a work as that 
which is now in the progress of publication. 

He rises with the earliest dawn, and devotes the whole of 
the day, in intense industry, to his favourite pursuit. The 
specimens from which he makes his drawings are all from 
nature; carefully noting the colours of the eye, bill, and 
legs ; measuring, with great accuracy, every part of the bird. 
Where differences exist, either in the sexes or young, several 
figures are given on the same plate : sparing no labour in 
retouching old drawings or in making new ones, in all cases 
where he conceives there may be a possibility of making an 
improvement. In this way, he has already succeeded in 
figuring nearly the whole of the birds necessary to complete 
his splendid and important work. 

He keeps a journal, and regularly notes down every thing 
connected with natural history. This journal is always kept 
in English : a language which, it must be acknowledged, he 
writes very correctly, when it is taken into consideration that 
he spent nearly the first seventeen years of his life in France. 
Besides this, he keeps separate journals, in which he notes 
every thing that he learns each day on the habits of every 
bird. In all his travels, he carries these journals with him; 
and he never suffers business, fatigue, or pleasure to prevent 
him each evening from noting down every interesting observ- 
ation. In this way, a mass of information has been accu- 
mulated from year to year. When he sits down to write the 
history of a bird (which is usually in the evening), he first 
reads over all the memoranda which he has made with 
regard to its habits ; and he is generally able to write an inter- 
esting paper on the subject- in the course of the evening. At 
some leisure moment this is again reviewed and corrected : 
the scientific details he leaves to the last. In America there 
are few private or public libraries that can furnish a writer on 
ornithology with all the information he is desirous of obtain- 
ing on this subject. Mr. Audubon does not hesitate about 
consulting with other naturalists in regard to all that may be 
written or known on the birds of America. He wishes to 



Retrospective Criticistn, 173 

render his work as perfect as the experience and knowledge 
of man, in the present state of his information, can make it ; 
and he endeavours to obtain all the additional light that 
industry or enquiry can shed on the subject. In obtaining 
this kind of assistance from those whose knowledge of books 
enables them to afford it, he does not conceive that he is the 
less entitled to the claim of the authorship of a work, the 
whole design of which (the most important feature in its 
execution), together with the composition, is altogether his 
own. 

When Wilson, the highly talented American ornithologist, 
first commenced his invaluable work, he did not hesitate to 
apply to his scientific friends for all the information they were 
able to afford him. In his letter to Bartram, dated May 21. 
1804, found in the 36th page of his Life, by his friend and 
biographer Mr. Ord, we find Wilson using the following 
language : — "I send you a few more imitations of birds for 
your opinion, which I value beyond that of any body else. 
Please to send me the names of the birds." 

Now, although Wilson received all the aid which the 
observations and reading of his friend could afford him, yet 
it would be the height of injustice to his memor}'^ and his 
well-merited fame, to assert that Bartram was the author of 
his work. Let us be as just to Audubon as we are to his 
predecessor, and we shall not withhold from him the merit of 
being the author of his Otmithological Biography. 

If the idea is entertained abroad, that the character and 
acquirements of Mr. Audubon are not estimated in his native 
land, or that his splendid publication is not appreciated here, 
it is most certain that the impression is altogether erroneous. 
The United States, although comparatively a new country, 
and possessing but few men of very large fortunes, duly 
appreciate the value of his work, and the merits of the 
individual. 

Since his last return to America he has already received 
sixty-one subscribers to his work, with very little exertion 
on his part. It has been added to the library of Congress, 
and the legislatures of many of the states have become sub- 
scribers. The government has allowed him and his attend- 
ants the free use of all our public vessels in every part of the 
United States. Honours have been conferred on him by the 
learned societies of our land, and the attentions which have 
been bestowed upon him, by the most intelligent men in our 
country, are such as have never been conferred upon any 
former naturalist. 

The additions already made to American ornithology by- 



174 Retrospective Criticism, 

the labours of Audubon are immense : suffice it to say, that 
he has added upwards of one hundred species not figured by 
Wilson. Some of these have been described in the valuable 
continuation of Wilson's work by Bonaparte. Still, with 
these deductions, there will be an immense number of new 
birds published in the work of Audubon, for" a knowledge of 
 which the public will be solely indebted to his zeal, industry, 
and experience. Amongst other interesting discoveries made 
by him may be noticed a new heron, and an eagle, the largest 
in the United States ; two species of pigeon, a humming- 
bird, and a considerable number of the genera of the Musci- 
capa. Troglodytes, Sylvia, and i^ringilla. 

His services alone, in correcting the errors into which his 
predecessors had fallen, from the want of opportunities such 
as he has enjoyed, are invaluable, and will be duly appre- 
ciated by the lovers of natural history. It may be interesting 
to your readers to notice a few of these. In his recent visit 
to Labrador, to which inhospitable region he was led solely 
by his ardent zeal for the advancement of science, he has 
ascertained that the iarus marinus and the Zarus argenta- 
toides are the same bird in different stages of plumage. In 
the jLarus minutus and L, capistratus, a similar mistake had 
occurred. The y^'rdea Pealez of Bonaparte proves to be the 
young of the ^'rdea rufescens, as ascertained by Audubon in 
the highly interesting ornithological region of Florida; the 
figure of Wilson of the Rallus crepitans, given as the adult 
bird, proves to be that of a new species found in the fresh- 
water marshes of our southern country, and the Falco iagopus 
is only the immature bird of the Sancti Johannis. 

In addition to this, the visits of Audubon to the breeding- 
places of many other of our rare birds, in the extreme north 
and south of our country^ have enabled him to investigate 
their habits more fully, and to describe them more correctly, 
than had ever been done before. 

If the enquiry be made, what prospect there will be of the 
continuation of this work, in case the author should not live 
to complete it, I am happy to say that its publication is secured 
beyond the fear of accidents. The drawings of the birds 
for the whole work are nearly completed ; the materials for 
their history are collected and recorded ; and there exists 
sufficient acquirement in the members of his interesting and 
talented family to carry on the work. 

Let the literary world but award to Audubon the justice 
which he merits ; let the public continue to be indulgent and 
liberal, and this work cannot fail to prove a very important 
acquisition to the natural history of America, nor to reflect the 



Retrospective Criticism, 175 

highest credit on the liberality of the British public, that has 
hitherto so efficiently aided him in the publication of it, nor to 
establish an abiding monument to the fame of its author, 
whilst it must continue to be selected as the chosen companion 
of those who delight in the contemplation and investigation of 
the phenomena of nature, in one of the most interesting depart- 
ments of her works. — John Bachman. Charleston^ Dec, 31.

The Common Redwing is a resident Species in the extreme 
North of Scotland and ifi the Isles. (Mr. Blyth, in VI. 516.) — 
I should feel obliged to Mr. Blyth if he would state its 
locality, and whether he has had personal opportunities of 
examining it in its summer haunts, as, I believe, this bird has 
hitherto generally been looked upon in the light of a stranger, 
merely paying us a visit during the winter season. I can 
assure Mr. Blyth it is not a summer resident on the eastern 
coast of Scotland or in the Orkney Islands, although Dr. 
Barry says, in his History of the Orkney Islands^ book iii. 
p. 316., 2d edit., " it may be seen in Hoy for the most part of 
summer, and always in harvest; where it probably builds among 
the shrubs in the valleys." At least, I could not discover this 
bird, during an extensive excursion through these islands and 
a great part of the Highlands in the summer of 183] ; my prin- 
cipal object being that of inspecting the habits and nidification 
of the different birds that resort thither. The only instance 
recorded of the redwing's breeding in the British Islands is 
in Montagu ; who says, " Mr. Bullock found a nest in the 
Island of Harris in the Hebrides." The solitary instance 
here mentioned must invalidate the idea of those heard by 
W. L. (VI. 218.) being identical with the redwing, unless 
their locality is changed since Mr. Bullock's visit; or, otherwise, 
he must have found their nests in greater abundance than he 
appears to have done. 

I suspect that the young of the missel thrush (Zurdus vis- 
civorus) has very often been mistaken for the redwing, as 
they congregate towards the end of the summer. I saw, 
during the month of August, at least a hundred assembled to- 
gether, and at first thought they were a flock of fieldfares or 
redwings ; but, on a closer examination, I discovered my mis- 
take. They certainly must migrate. The fact of their mi- 
grating is mentioned in V. 581. 

Montagu says further of the redwing, " It is said to breed 
in Norway and Sweden." Bewick says only the latter countr3\ 
Mr. Hewitson, who visited Norway last summer, did not find 
it there, although he saw its congener, the fieldfare (Turdus 
pihxris) ; and in his British Oology^ Nos. xiv. and xv., says, "it 



17& Hetrosjpective Criticism, 

is the most abundant bird in Norway, and is generally diffused 
over that part which we visited, breeding (so contrary to the 
habits of other species of the genus Turd us with which we 
are acquainted) in society ; 200 nests or more being frequently 
within a very small space." Possibly some of the readers or 
correspondents of the Magazine, who may be personally 
acquainted with the Western Islands, will favour us with a 
more minute description of the nest, eggs, and general habits 
of the redwing. — J, D. Salmon, Stoke Ferty, Norfolk, [See

The Black Viper, (VI. 527., VII. 76.) — Mr. Bree's remarks 
(in VII. 76.) do not disincline me to repeat my former assertion, 
that I believe that there is but one species of poisonous reptile 
in England, namely, Fipera -Serus. The black viper is an 
extreme variety, but every intermediate shade exists. — E,N,D,

Criticisms on some Species of Insects published in IVood's " In-

gen. 790. 9., has given JEghria stomoxyformis of Stephens as 
the ? of his mutillaeformis, for which he has been ridiculed ; 
Mr. Stephens having subsequently said that the stomoxyformis 
which he has figured is a " ^ , with ciliated ajitemice^' \ In my 
copy of Mr. Stephens's work, the figure of stomoxyformis 
(plate 11. fig. 3.) appears to be a female, and has 7iot ciliated 
antennae; though culiciform is (plate 10. fig. 3.) is a ^ , with 
^^ ciliated antenyicB ;^^ but Mr. Curtis does not refer to that. 
It does not appear that either Mr. Stephens or Mr. Wood 
has figured the true Sesia stomoxyformis of Hub. ; of which 
this (Jig, 33.) is a copy. It has two . 

orange lines on the thorax; a band •f^f^%JNn<Vi,aMTi 
and four spots of the same colour on "^^^^^^^^^B? 
the abdomen ; which agrees with Ste- ^^^^^^^^^S^ 
phens's Latin description, as well it ' m 

may, his being copied verbatim from 33 H 

Ochsenheimer, with the omission of " 

the word in parenthesis ; viz. " Alis (hyalinis) anticarum mar- 
ginibus fasciaque nigris; thoracis lineis duabus abdominis 
barbati cingulo j)unctisque later alihtis fulvis ; palpis omnino 
nigris." But Mr. Stephens, in his English description, says, 
" thorax glossy, immacidate ; abdomen with fourth segment 
fulvous, orange, interrupted by a dusky black line beneath," 
&c. Whether this (Mr. Stephens's) is a good species, I will 
not pretend to say, as I have not had an opportunity o^ seeing 
a specimen. 

Catocdla elocdta, — Mr. Stephens has remarked that " this 
fine insect presents a conspicuous instance of the baneful 
practice of mixing foreign and indigenous productions toge- 
ther ; particularly when undistinguished by any memorandum 
or label ; as, in consequence of an unticketed specimen having 
been detected in the collection of the late Mr. Blunt, this spe- 
cies has not only been selected and figured as a British ex- 
ample of the genus Catocala, but the error has also been 
subsequently copied into Loudon's Magazine [I. 272. fig.

Mr. Stephens is, by this assertion, called upon to prove 
that Mr. Blunt's C. elocata came direct from Oporto ; and 
I should be glad to be at the same time informed what the 
" some three or four other foreign species " were that " dis-

of D. galii being there, that can easily be explained : — "It 
was sold hy Mr. Stephens to the late Mr. Blunt y^^r a British 
insect : " a baneful practice, which might mislead any one. 
This specimen of D. galii is now in Mr. Curtis's cabinet. It 
was set like an English insect; and formed, with two speci- 
mens of S'phinjr ligustri, the seventy-third lot at Mr. Stephens's 
sale o^ British insects in 1825; and, till it came into Mr.Curtis's

(VI. 495. notef, VII. 77, 78.) — Sir, I thank your corre- 
spondents, Lacon and Discipulus, for giving me an oppor- 
tunity of performing an act of justice towards Mr. Newman. 
You will recollect that the note (VI. 495. notef) to which 
these critics allude (VII. 77, 78.) was added in the hurry of 
correcting the press [It was added in the proof — J, D.^; 
and, at the moment, remembering that Mr. Haliday was the 
first English author who had employed the compound term 
metatarsus, but at the same time thinking he had made a 
more extensive application of these names, I considered that 
Mr. Newman had merely extended the idea, and that it would 
but be doing common justice to Mr. Haliday to mention the 
circumstance. Discipulus, however, overlooks (p. 78.) the fact, 
that, although the word thorax may be found in the lexicon, 
it also occupies a place in the Latin dictionary, and that in 
natural-history language, it is constantly used and declined 
as a Latin word : hence the terms medithorax and post- 
thorax are not so worthy of the mark of ridicule which a 
recent reviewer has thought proper to attach to them. More- 
over, my observation upon the barbarous compound nature of 
these names did not (notwithstanding your editorial paren- 
thesis to the contrary) apply to the designation of the thoracic

segments, but to the limbs attached to them. The remedy I 
proposed would have this result: medipedes and postpedes, 
medicoxae, postcoxse, medifemora, posttibiae, &c. (Latin 
compounds), would be introduced, instead of mesopedes, 
metapedes, mesofemora, &c. ; all of which are Greek and 
Latin compounds. 

Setting this objection aside, as well as that of the primary 
distribution of the thoracic segments, it is still undeniable, 
that this system of nomenclature, although attempted to be 
applied, is not applicable, as it ought to be, to all the thoracic 
appendages. If applied only to the legs and their various 
parts, it is good ; but, when applied to the wings, we have 
those organs which are attached not to the proihorax, but 
to the mesoihovsiyi ; termed proalad, not 7nesa\ad ; whilst, on 
the other hand, were the system to be adhered to through- 
out, we should be under the necessity of terming the anterior 
or mesothoracic wings, middle wings, or mesalae. 

I shall only add that Mr. Lacon has again shown [in 
p. 77.] his critical abilities, by calling the metatarsus of 
Haliday the last, instead of the first or basal joint of the 
tarsus. I am, Sir, yours, &c. — J. O. Westiwod. The Grove,

Cyathocrinite versus Encrinite. (78.) — As Mr. Conway has, 
in p. 78 to 80., accused me of error and misrepresentation, in 
stating that the pelvis and part of the costals of the cyatho- 
crinite, figured in VI. 561., have been covered by the column, 
I beg to assure him that it is nevertheless true ; and that, 
although he asserts it to be " a physical impossibility," yet it 
is a real fact, as several specimens in my cabinet distinctly 

prove, one of which (a frag- 
ment from the Derbyshire 
limestone) is here figured. 
(fg. 34.) Ahhough to Mr. 
Conway it may appear dif- 
ficult to account for the use 
of those plates, when so co- 
vered by the column, yet no 
such difliculty occurred to

Miller, who says, in a note, p. 67. of 
his Crinoidea, " it is not unlikely that 
the real joints forming the pelvis are so 
much abbreviated as not to be visible ex- 
ternally." I also send a figure (J^g* 35.) 
taken from another specimen, in which 
the plates, which Mr. Conway seems to doubt the existence of, 
are better developed than in the specimen before mentioned. 

Mr. Conway asks, " Does it not always follow, as a matter 
of course, that, when the column is enlarged and expanded at 
its junction with the pelvis, the pelvis is also widened and 
enlarged in the same proportion, as in the genus Apiocrinites ?" 
and then says, " This, I think, cannot be denied." But, if he 
had examined the genus Platycrinites, in which the column 
occupies only a small portion of the centre of the pelvis, as in

compared it with the genus 
Apiocrinites, I feel confident 
that he would not have ha- 
zarded a speculation for which 
there is so little foundation ; 
and, in my opinion, there is 
much the same chance of suc- 
cess for his speculation re- 
specting the gradual change 
[transition by an intervening 
series of affinities] of En- 
crinites into Cyathocrinites ; 
for though I have not seen the 
specimen in the Geological 
Transactions, yet in every specimen of Cyathocrinites that has 
come under my observation, the plates of the body are alike in 
number and position; and the superior parts, arms, hands, &c., 
are invariably divided by what Miller terms cuneiform joints ; 
whereas, in the Encrinites, the only plate which has this form 
in the scapula, and the only division which takes place above 
it is by a totally different process. 

A little further on, Mr. Conway states that it was because 
he considered his specimen a nondescript that he communi- 
cated it to this Magazine; but he most unaccountably forgets 
himself. He did not communicate it as a nondescript, but as 
the lily encrinite. He says (VI. 1 25.), — " I had my attention 
amply rewarded by being furnished with a specimen of the 
lily encrinite, of which I here send you a drawing, of the 
natural size :" and at the conclusion (p. 128.), — " If I am right 
in supposing it to be the first discovered specimen of the lily

encrlnite, I sliall reckon myself singularly fortunate in having 
obtained possession of it;" tlie only doubt expressed in the 
letter being, whether it had been previously found in England 
or not. That it is not what he has there stated it to be, and 
what I particularly disputed, Mr. Conway himself now ad- 
mits, and the only difference which can yet be found betwixt 
his specimen and mine is, that the one is tuberculated and 
the other smooth ; but, when it is stated that I possess spe- 
cimens of the bodies, both plain and covered with tubercles 
of various sizes, yet exactly alike in every other respect, very 
few indeed will refuse to concede that they must rank together 
till some better distinction can be found, and it is much to 
be regretted that a name should have been given to any of 
them founded upon so very variable a character. 

Having freed myself from the charges brought against me, 
I beg to conclude whh informing Mr. Conway, that it is pro- 
bable that his curiosity will be gratified, before the end of the 
year, by the publication of such of my specimens as are of 
sufficient interest to be included in Mr. Phillips's intended

[^Notice of a Species of Mouse, possibly an undescrihed one, 
'which has abounded in Inveimess-shire and Ross-shire,'] — 
In the May and June of 1832, over a great extent of moun- 
tainous district, including all the western divisions of Inver- 
ness-shire and Ross-shire (my enquiries have not extended 
into Argyle), the shepherds began to observe that their dogs 
were incessantly killing mice, which they naturally concluded 
to be what they usually call field mice. They observed that 
these mice increased as the summer advanced ; and that the 
grassy parts of the mountains were much destroyed by them, as 
they seemed, like the cut-worm, or larva of the 7"ipula graminea 
[ ? cornicina], to prefer the blanched part of the herbage, among 
the mosses and decayed matter of former years ; so that these 
grassy parts became brown. A curious and very interesting fact 
took place in consequence of, or rather accompanied, this great 
increase of these mice; namely, the foxes, early in the sunnner, 
finding such a supply of food, which they appear to prefer to 
all others *, ceased from that time to destroy any more lambs. 

* I have long known that dogs (and, I think, the shepherd's beyond all 
others) are particularly fond ot" the Alpine mouse ; and, although I have 
repeatedly triod, in various quarters, to obtain specimens, it has been in 
vain, as the shepherds tell nie that they only discover them by their dogs, 
who instantly swallow them. 

N 3 



182 Queries and Anders. 

But, some time in the spring of 1833, the mice were observed 
to have retired, like the lemmings of Norway ; and the foxes, 
in want of their accustomed food, again fell upon the sheep 
(the Iambs at first) with unwonted fury. 

During the time that these mice were most abundant, the 
person who manages Mr. Frazer of Eskadale's sheep-farms, 
a man of rather superior acuteness and sagacity, paid some 
attention to them. He says, that, as near as he could esti- 
mate, they devoured about 8 bolls (64 bushels) of his potatoes ; 
and that he dug out of one hole no less than seventeen of 
them, of various colours, probably young ones. He says that 
" their general colour was brown, with a white ring about 
the neck ; and the tail likewise tipped with white ; a light- 
coloured stripe down the nose and along the back." As soon 
as I heard of this irruption of mice, I sent repeated requests 
for specimens, which, I suppose, was put off as a thing that 
could be " done any time ; " and now the mice have, it seems, 
departed from the land. If any correspondent would inform 
me if they have seen or heard of such a species of mouse, it 
would be very gratifying to me. I have seen two or three 
that I never could find any description or resemblance of in 
books. — W. i. SelkirJcsJiire^ Dec, 20. 1833. 

Has the Animal Le Lerot ofCuvier''s " Regne Animal** been 
observed in any English Orchard or Garden ? With incidental 
hiformation on the Importation of Apples from Jersey and 
Guernsey to the West of England for manufacturing into Cider 
in the latter Place, — By a friend who has resided several 
years at Havre, I am informed that great destruction of the 
best fruit in the gardens takes place by the depredations of 
an animal about the size of a common rat, which eats the 
fruit as it becomes ripe. The name given to it by the in- 
habitants in that part of France is le rat mulot, or the rat 
field-mouse. It resembles a squirrel more than a rat, the 
end of its tail being tufted. From the proximity of the 
northern coast of France to England, and the great import- 
ation of fruit in the autumn, it is rather remarkable that the 
animal has not been imported into this country. I do not 
recollect ever seeing any animals of this kind in France or 
Switzerland, but I understand they are very numerous. On 
referring to Le Regne Animal of Cuvier, I find, among les 
Rongeurs [Animalia rodentia, the gnawing animals], an animal 
named le lerot, which must be the animal provincially called 
rat midot. It is described " as rather smaller than the rat, 
of a greyish brown colour above, and white beneath. The 
eye is surrounded with black hair, which extends and spreads 
to the shoulder. The tail, which is tufted only at the end, is 
black ; but the extremity is white. It is common in French

gardens, living in holes in walls, and doing much injury to 
the espaliers." Perhaps some correspondent can inform us 
whether the rai midot has ever been seen in English gardens or 
orchards, and can tell us something more respecting it than 
my meagre description does. 

On a late visit to Weymouth I noticed the large import- 
ation of apples from Jersey and Guernsey : waggon loads in 
sacks were frequently passing my apartments. On enquiry, I 
found they were sent inland to make cider. Can there be 
any other reason why the cider should not be made in Jersey 
and Guernsey, and imported from those islands, except the 
difficulty of importing all kinds of liquors, from the caution 
necessary to be observed in preventing smuggling of spirits 
and wine? — i?. B. Nov. 26. 1833. 

Staflifigs and Rooks, — In the country, I have very fre- 
quently observed that immense flights of starlings attend on 
large flocks of rooks : when driven from one field, they fly to 
another, in company, though not mingled, but each forming 
a separate squadron. Does either species serve as a guide to 
any kind of food acceptable to both ? or for what purpose is 
this strange association ? — E, N. D. Sej^temher, 1833. 

[Scolopax rusticola, in " Notes on the Starling, V. 284-., has 
these remarks : — The starlings " are often seen in company 
with the rooks, and are in the habit of frequenting pastures 
with their larger companions. Their food, possibly, consists 
of the same species of worms, slugs, grubs, &c. They will 
often build under the rooks' nests in the rookery, and thus 
appear something like dependants."] 

Has any Correspondent heard the Song of the Water Ouzel f 
— My attention was attracted to it during a fishing excursion 
in North Wales, on October 8. 1833 ; and I should describe it 
as something similar to the faint warbling of the lesser petty- 
chaps, but continued a considerable time without cessation, 
as that of the stare [starling]. I was some time in ascertain- 
ing the fact, as the bird was sitting under a projecting bank ; 
and, consequently, the song appeared to come from the water. 
I never before had an opportunity of hearing it, which I attri- 
bute to the extreme shyness of the bird. — G. B. Oct. 18. 1833. 

[In I. 494., a correspondent has queried the name of a strange 
bird whose characteristics he gives : one of these is, ** its cry 
resembled that of the water ouzel."]

of Plymouth ; in compliment to whom, I propose, if it has 
not been previously described, to apply to it the epithet Ban- 
nan/. The only distinction which I can find between it and 
G. stercorarius is the very striking appearance of two circular 
spots, one on each elytron, not far from the apex (tip), of a 
dull red or orange colour, with a black spot in the centre ; 
the whole exactly resembling, in form and size, the ocelli on 
the upper wings of Hipparchia Janir«, or meadow brown 
butterfly, but differing in hue. It is of about 9 lines in length, 
and of a somewhat brownish black above, and bronzed with 
tints of copper and violet beneath. Mr. Bannan has taken, 
in this neighbourhood, two individuals perfectly alike. The 
specimen taken secondly has been accidentally destroyed ; but 
that taken first is in the highest preservation. Is it an unde- 
scribed species, or an undescribed variety only ? — W. A.

Larvce of the Syrphidco, — It is stated in p. 283. of Ifisect 
Transformations, that the maggots of this family attach them- 
selves to a leaf or a plant ; but in p. 5. it is asserted that they 
live in common sewers. Which of these two statements is 
the correct one ? I incline to believe in the latter. — J. H. F, 

[Both statements are correct. The larva of one of the 
Syrphidae is found attached to the leaves of the hop plant, 
and destroys, for its food, great numbers of the A^phis humuli, 
which, in some seasons, commits most serious injury to the 
health and welfare of this plant, and consequently to the crop 
of hops. All this is taught us by Rusticus of Godalming, in 
the Entomological Magazine, vol. i. p. 223., and the editor's 
footnote. Off a hop plant in our garden we, in 1 833, bred one 
or two of this syrphideous fly ; at least we suppose of the very 
same species : a competent entomologist has named our spe- 
cimen, Syrphus balteatus. 

Of the larva or maggot of another of the Syrphidae, the 
Eristalis (iVfusca) tenax, it may safely be said, sewers, and the 
filthiest of places. Of this larva and its habits a pleasing de- 
scription will be found in Samouelle's Entomological Cabinet, 
No. ii. t. 3,, where a figure of the fly, and of the cast skin of 
its pupa, are given. " In the larva state, when it is called 
* the rat-tailed worm,' it breathes through a tail formed of re- 
tractile tubes, like a telescope, capable of being contracted or 
extended, according to the varying depth of the larva in the 
mud below." {Entomologia Edinensis, p. 35.) 

This fly is an interesting creature, in autumn, on the blos- 
soms of ivy, and the Compositae, as starworts, sunflowers, &c. ; 
and a hundred interesting facts on it, eligible for threading 
into a history of its habits^ might be noted.]

Mr. Swainson's name stands so deservedly high, both as an 
ornithologist and an artist, that, in introducing this splendid 
work to the notice of our readers, we shall simply say that we 
consider it in every respect worthy of its author. Farther 
commendation we feel would be superfluous. Mr, Swainson 
has, with great judgment, abandoned the expensive and cum- 
brous plan of publishing in folio or quarto, and adopted that 
of royal 8vo. He is thus enabled to give plates at a lower 
price than has ever previously been done. The numbers are to 
be published quarterly ; and four of them, containing toge- 
ther fifty exquisitely drawn and beautifully coloured plates, 
are to constitute a volume, for which the price is 21. 2s, The 
first series, of which No. I. is before us, is to contain the 
birds of Brazil ; and we are delighted to see Mr. Swainson 
thus erecting a monument to bear witness of his arduous and 
praiseworthy researches in that interesting and beautiful 
country. We are but stay-at-homes ; and we delight in that 
exquisite art which can thus bring the tropics in all their glo- 
rious panoply of charms palpably and visibly before us, with- 
out the slightest apprehension from the crushing folds of boa 
constrictors, or the savage and insatiable cruelty of jaguars.

Fourteen pages, in a chapter at the end, include what is

may be seen, has striven to identify the objects spoken of with 
the systematised species of naturalists, this is but partly done. 
The information on the geology of Persia is richer than that 
on its zoology and botany. That which is told, is told most 
agreeably. We would that a similar style of narrative were 
obvious in all notices of objects of natural history.

" Many of the most rare and beautiful species of volutes 
have been figured by Swainson in the first plates of his Exotic 
Conchology, with a verisimilitude that has never been equalled, 
and probably never will be excelled, by an artist. This 
talent; combined with his scientific knowledge as a naturalist, 
must render the above work the most eminent of its kind." 
Such was the opinion of the late lamented Lamarck, who, 
from his intimate knowledge of the subject, was better qua- 
lified to give an opinion on the merits of a work like this 
than any writer who has ever existed. Mr. Swainson ob- 
serves that a few of the early plates were published some 
years ago ; but unavoidable accidents having injured the 
remainder, they were withdrawn, and nearly the whole have 
since been re-executed. Six parts, one to be published every 
alternate month, will complete the work. Nothing can ex- 
ceed the delicate, chaste, and exquisite beauty of the figures 
in the first part. Plates 3. 5. and 8. are gems to rivet the 
attention of th'e most fastidious connoisseur ; and defy alike 
rivalry or copyism. There is a subdued and quiet colouring 
in all Mr. Swainson's works that will plead for itself against 
the meretricious glare and gaiety now so much in vogue. It 
is impossible to make Nature too beautiful ; but it is very easy 
to make her too gaudy. — E.

researches) is an insect taken by M. Menetries, in July, at 
Schadach, to the east of Caucasus, at the height of more than 
9000 ft., and near to the region of perpetual snow. In 
affinity, its place is between the genera Podisma and Gompho- 
cerus, according to the method of M. Audinet-Serville. Its 
antennae are so compressed as to form two lanceolate leaves ; 
and M. Fischer would have named it Phyllocerus, but that 
Dejean has previously used this word as a name to a coleop- 
terous genus. The external anatomy of the insect is de- 
scribed in detail. A figure of the insect, and others of its 
parts magnified, are appended.

We, of the multitude, have been long enough, ay, far too 
long, excluded from the pleasure of making ourselves ac- 
quainted with the names and entomological associations con- 
nected with insects. How so ? Because insects have been 
named, described, and figured, partly in this work, partly 
in that, and pardy in all the rest of the works ; so that only 
those who could buy or make access to the majority of those 
which constitute the bibliotheca entomologica could acquaint 
themselves with all the names for, and descriptions of, insects 
which entomological naturalists, from Aristotle to those of 
1834, have invented and elaborated. A better state of things 
is now dawning upon us. The work whose title is given 
above is, as far as we know, the very herald of it. We hail 
its appearance with true pleasure, and truly hope that our 
insect-loving friends will, as ourselves, " therefore as a 
stranger give it welcome I " Not that it addresses itself to 
our regard on its strangerhood alone, but, over and above its 
attractiveness on this ground, also on its own (so we think) 
most valid merits. 

" A whole is greater than a part ; " so the Coleoptera of 
the Edinburgh neighbourhood are not tantamount to the 
Coleoptera of Britain. No : but they, doubtless, are so in a 
good degree, at least in relation to the families and the genera ; 
but herein, kind fellow students, consists, we think, the value 
of the book ; not in enabling us to trace out and ascertain the 
7iame of any and every British beetle we may meet with, 
** and there an end ; " but (and far better is this faculty

ening, empowering application. 

The descriptions of the sections, subsections, families, 
genera, and species are, in a good degree, detailed ; yet, we 
think, lucid. Short, but pleasing, notices of the habits are 
interspersed ; the internal anatomy of many species is noticed ; 
the derivation and literal meaning of many generic names are 
given; the descriptions are all in English, and have been 
derived from a familiar, a living acquaintance with the crea- 
tures described ; or, in the case of the rarer and very rare 
species, from a diligent and judicious reading. A very 
pleasing and a truly useful introduction of 59 pages is prefixed 
to the work.

Apercu d'Histoire Naturelle, et Observations sur lesLimites 
qui separent le Regne Vegetal du Regne Animal. 8vo, 
35 pages. Boulogne, 1833. 

This is an address read before the Society of Agriculture, 
Commerce, and of the Arts, of Boulogne sur Mer, at its 
meeting of Sept. 19. 1832. The greater portion is occupied 
with a review of the principal classes into which animals and 
vegetables have been divided, written in a rather declamatory 
style, and of no further interest or use than as serving to 
introduce the views of M. Gaillon respecting those sorts of 
^'Igae which inhabit the debatable grounds that lie between 
the two kingdoms of organised beings. The A'lgae alluded 
to are composed of globular or lenticular granules lying loose 
and disconnected, or embedded in a transparent mucus, or 
compacted together on a slimy membrane, or enclosed within" 
capillary tubes which divide and branch away exactly after 
the fashion of acknowledged Confervae. They form the fami- 
lies Diatomaceae, Gloiocladeae, iJyssoideae, and Oscillatoriae, 
and embrace some of the genera of the Conferveae, Siph^neae, 
and f/Ivaceae of Dr. Hooker's English Flora, (vol. v.) Now, 
all of these, M. Gaillon maintains, are animals, and, under the 
name of Nemazoaires, ought to be transferred to the animal 
kingdom ; for he has seen, and many others have witnessed 
the same phenomena, the granules, both in the separate and 
combined state, move from place to place, as if actuated by 
volition; he has seen them, when stationary, perform motions 
to and fro on some fixed point ; he has seen them change 
their form, dilate, and contract; and he has seen a globule of 
little coloured grains ejected from the interior, which, he main- 



1 90 Nees von Esenheclc'^ Florce Genna7iiccE Gciiera. 

tains, is their spawn. At first, it would appear, the granules 
of all of them are separate and free, and move about in a 
very lively manner, but after a time they approximate and 
unite each after its own nature, and, by their aggregation or 
successive evolution, produce forms so similar to those of 
confervoid plants that their real nature has been hidden until 
these times. 

Of the nature of these productions we have now then 
three opinions: the first, that they are vegetable; the se- 
cond, that they possess successively an animal and a ve- 
getable existence (see our I. 305.) ; and the third is that 
before us, and which believes them to be entirely animal. 
Were it necessary to choose between them, we confess our 
partiahty to the eldest born ; and, admitting all that has been 
said of the mobility and contractility of these Nemazoaires as 
true, we may still hesitate to admit that they are sufficient for 
the annihilation of this opinion; the more especially when 
we remember the observations of R. Brown, which prove 
that the granules or corpuscles of even unorganised matter 
possess all these apparently voluntary motions, both loco- 
motive and rotatory. But neither leisure nor space permit us 
to enter upon this discussion, nor yet into the question how 
far the observations made on these granules support the specu- 
lations which have been anew broached on the doctrine of 
spontaneous generation.

although in a very slight degree, by contributing to our know- 
ledge of the geographical distribution of British plants. Some 
notices of the geology of the district are then added. The 
plants are arranged in the natural orders ; the habitat or 
habitats are given under the name of each species. Besides 
the habitats, a few original remarks on the habits and bota- 
nical characters of certain species occur in the manual. This 
practice we think excellent: it was Relham's, in every edition 
of his Flora Cantahrigiensis ; it has been applied more amply 
by Gerarde Edwards Smith, in his Flora of South Kent, than 
by any one else that we know of.

It is far better than Pinnock's Catechism of Botany, pub-

is as a man in child's petticoats. Query, Is colloquy the fittest 
mode in which to communicate a knowledge of a science ? 
We should desire not to have the understanding of a child 
insulted with such questions as these : — " Are vegetables 
ornamental?" " Are there many different kinds of plants ?" 
It is true that these, and such as these, are followed by answers 
profound enough and eloquent enough for an adolescent 
mind ; but such a mind would not wish them, nor like them 
better because they came, " in such a questiondhle shape." 
In p. 43., a cut of the banana tree or of the plantain tree,

upon, contains the best and richest stock of botanical know- 
ledge ever offered for nine-pence.

Having already \'m VI. 289. to 308.] developed the prin- 
cipal bearings of this obscure topic, u}ion which I am desirous 
of throwing, if possible, a ray of light, there can be no neces- 
sity to recapitulate them. I shall, therefore, select from an 
abundance of facts in my possession such as appear most 
conducive to that end ; and, in order to prevent the confusion 
which arises from embracing too many points of view at once 
(although they are, as the motto aptly states them to be, 
" cohaerentia, connexa, concatenata," in away scarcely credible 
by a person who has not entered on the enquiry), consider, in 
this and some following papers, the heads of the argument 
under distinct and individual illustrations. The present will

lias enquired only respecting the species of which the mice 
in question may be, 1 adduce his statement c)n another ground. 
He says that tl\e mice did_ prodigioas da'mage over a wide 
extent of country in May and June, 1832; that their increase 
was extraordinary; and their disappearance sudden, in the 
spring of 1833. Now, in July, 1833, a similar irruption of 
mice occurred- in -the county of Galway^ in Ireland, doing 
similar damage to the crops of graSs and corn ;"and, as far as 
I have ascertained, the circumstances in both cases are alike. 
These irruptions of mice are not without their parallel in 
former years ; and everj tourist along the Rhine must have 
heard of the famous ^-Hatto ' II., archbishop of Mentz, 
who, in time oi famine^ refusing to- sell or give corn to his 
people, fled for safety to a castle (der Mausethurm) on the 
river, where myriads of mice^ pursuing the avaricious prelate, 
devoured him alive. Notwithstanding the lucubrations of 
Leitch Ritchie, Esq.*, we must consider the tradition (even if 
derived, as I believe, from a fact relating to the natural his- 
tory of the mouse) properly defined, by Klein [Tlheinr else von 
Mainz vis Koln, p. 57.), a " fantasie," and by Fischer, 
{Neueste?- Wegweiser, p. 99.), a " lacherliche monchslegende " 
(a ridiculous monkish legend). Nevertheless, the •" Mause- 
thurm" has its counterpart in Pliny, if we may trust that au- 
thor. " M. Varro," says he, " autor est, a cuniculis sufFossum in

serves dsewhere: — "Supra ctmcta est murium foetus : . . . .

had been driven out by mice ; and Amyclae, in Italy, destroyed by serpents."

his times [end of third centurif)^ has made distinct mention of 
mice as agents of destruction, and in connection with ter- 
restrial convulsions and. calamities. Amongst a long cata- 
logue of hailstorms, drought, scarcity, famine, pestilence, 
aerolites, and earthquake;? *, are these words : — " Annalium 
scripta percurrite Irnguarum diversitatibus scripta, universas 
discetis gentes ssepenumero desolatas et viduatas suis esse 
cultoribus. Ab locustis^ ab mtcribuSf genus omne acciditur 
atque arroditur frugum. Historias ite per vestras, et ab istis 
pestibus instruemini queries prior wtas affecta et paupertatis 
ad miserias venerit."f And, as if these two allusions could 
not be strong enough, he again introduces 7nice : " Si in Asia, 
Syria, idcirco inures ^t locustas efferyescere prodigaliterf," &c. 
{Disp. contra Gentes, i. § 2. et 5.) 

I desire to make no more use of these quotations than the 
case in point allows. Pliny speaks of the marvellous increase 
of mice, and their sudden disappearance, attributing the for- 
mer to drought ; and Arnobius couples them with the locusts, 
whose histor}', and connection with diseases and terrestrial 
phenomena, are well known. Cuvier {Regne Animal, 1817, 
tom. i. p. 193.) says also, the Mus arvalis Lin, " quelquefois 
se multiplie excessivement, et cause de grands degats."§ The 
" quelquefois " [sometimes] of Cuvier is undefined ; but Ar- 
nobius has, I think, indirectly explained its limits. . . 

The history of the ..world proves , that there are. certain 
epochs, when all nature, animate and inanimate, is excited by 
some extraordinary impulse.. The. locust b associated by all 
writers with famine and pestilence, and with heat and earth- 
quakes. Locusts accpinpanied the^ black death, in 1337-8 

have been found pregnant. It, therefore, ceases to be" a wonder, whence 
such a power of mice should destroy the harvests. Kegarding which, it is 
still a secret how these immense numbers so suddenly disappear; for they 
are not found dead, neither is there any person to be met \yith who, during 
the winter, has dug up, a mouse in the fields. Many, have also made their 
appearance in the Troad, and have now ^driven the inhabitants thence. 
Their appearance is attributed to' drought.^ - - - .-.

of Barbary, in 1799-1800 {An. Beg.) \ and the plague in 
the days of Ethelred and Arthur (Caius). They are the 
index of disease in Africa and the East. When they go to 
the north, the Arabs always anticipate a general mortality 
(Jackson's Marocco). They are always contemporaneous, in 
Nubia, with the plague at Cairo (Light's Travels) ; and the 
plague ceases when the Nile rises, which it did not in 1833. 
In March, 1833, locusts appeared in France, probably 
strair^ders from a miirratorv horde, such as those which, 
A. D. 593, 852, 1271, 1335-9, 1541-51, 1693, 1732, 1747-8, 
1792-9, desolated various countries of Europe, as well as Asia 
and Africa. The locusts and mice have not, however, alone dis- 
tinguished 1832 and 1833. The mackerel and the mullet, the 
quail and the toadf, have been already noticed [VI. 289. 291, 
292.] ; the herrings must now be added, as having appeared, 
in 1833, earlier, and in greater abundance, than peihaps ever 
known. In the summer of 1833, a singular insect, there 
before unknown, ravaged the corn fields in Spain, and so 
poisoned the wheat, that it could not be eaten. In August, 
a black worm, as voracious as the locust, appeared in Canada, 
devouring the grass and wheat, and destroying the labours of 
the colonists. {Quebec Papers.) In the middle of Septem- 
ber occurred a great irruption of bears X about Paul's Bay, 
in Canada, said to be driven by hunger (Qiiebec Papers) ; and 
at the end of December, wild boars liad so much increased at 
Finisterre, in France, that dreadful ravages were committed, 
and one animal actually entered the town of Huelgoet, {Ar?nori- 
cain de Brest.) Livy tells us of a xwlfvihich. entered and passed 
through Rome in the year u.c. 556. {Hist, xxxiii. 26.), during 
a season of thunder-storms. It is probable that the same 
motive impelled both animals, and that the superstitions con- 
nected with the wolf saved him from being killed by the 
Romans. We have, however, better testimonies to support 
the bears, &c. ; for, in 1817, a similar irruption of those ani- 
mals occurred in Russia and Kamtschatka, in such numbers as

able, I may mention here that toads were seen abroad, in the present year 
(1834), on the 18th of January; and that a patriarch of his tribe came 
out from his seclusion, in a cellar of my present residence, on the 14th of 
that month. Frogs have spawned, and partridges have paired, occasionally, 
in the end of January.

had never been remembered, and it was then attributed to want 
of fish in the sea [An. Reg.), probably occasioned by some sub- 
marine convulsion driving the fish away. In 1799^ a black 
worm, similar to the one named above, destroyed whole forests 
in America, stripping the trees, so as to leave them as bare a& 
in winter. (An. Reg.) 

In 1833, birds increased prodigiously, and, inconsequence 
of the drought, were driven to desperate measures. In Sep- 
tember the rooks, in Gloucestershire, took to robbing (u^- 
chards. (Public Joiirnals.) A writer in a London journal 
says, small birds so much increased in the vicinity of Mar- 
low, that two whole crops of corn, besides beans, peas, 
and fruit, were devoured by them. [St. Jajnes's Chronicle, 
Feb. 1. 1834.) After the cessation of the black death, "mar- 
riages were almost without exception prolific ; double and 
triple births were more common than at other times " 
(Hecker, p. 79.); and such was the case after the cholera, in 
1833 and 1834, as it is generally remarked. In February, 
1834, abundance of mackerel, in innumerable shoals, visited 
the coasts of England, as in 1833.* 

In September, 1785, vast numbers of the West India shark 
appeared in the British Channel, and many were taken by 
the Brighton fishermen. {An. Reg., 1785.) In 1783, un- 
usual numbers of wasps and aphides appeared ; and thousands 
of acres of turnips were destroyed by the sax^Jlij, (Gilbert 
White, A^/7/. Hist. Selborne.) In 1785, aphides infested the 
south of England. [Ibid.) In 1796, damage to the amount 
of 100,000/. was done to turnips in Devonshire, by the black 
Jly. (Jardine on White, quoting Kirby and Spence.) In 
1762 and in 1782, myriads of yellow flies visited the coast of 
Norfolk. (Phil. Trans., 1 783.) They are described as being seen 
to be blown over from the sea, and piled dead on the shore 
in heaps. They were parents of a black cankcrworm, which 
in those years did infinite damage to turnips. They were so 
numerous, that, in their search for that plant, they covered 
the roads, gates, and hedges. So, at the epoch of the black 
death (1333 — 1359), " the itisect tribe was wonderfully called 
into life, as if animated beings were destined to complete the 
destruction." (Hecker, p. 44.) 

If we go to the Scriptures, we find the palmerworm, the 
caterpillar, the cankerworm, the locust, the frog, &c., de- 
scribed as miraculously increased at certain epochs, and

The conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing notes is 
self-evident, if we consider that the years individually men- 
tioned were marked by striking eviden<ics of a disturbed state 
of the earth and atmosphere. Without farther reference, it 
may suffice to say that every "one of those years was dis- 
tinguished by earthquakes, meteors, or other phenomena: 
and, to pass over 1333^1348, the epoch of the black death, 
and 1817, that of the cholera, we may take 1783 as an ex- 
ample ; a year marked by most surprising convulsions, f 
Indeed, it ivill be found that, at all periods of telluric dis-' 
turbance, some extraordinary movement takes place in the 
kingdoms of animated nature ; and, whenever there is an in- 
dication of the kind, it will be discovered that the excitement 
occurred at a. time: when the atmosphere has been unaccount- 
ably heated, the seasons aflfecited'. by some extraneous mo- 
difying cause of change, and the volcanic force especially 
developed. On this subject, I have not the slightest doubt; 
for it is capable of positive demonstration, if we may believe 
the testimony of undisputed facts, as they are registered in 
the calendars of naturahsts. Take the links where we will, in 
the chain of terrestrial phenomena, we find them preserving 
the character, the consistency, and the order of a series, 
which, examined in detail, or viewed in the mass, leads to 
the conclusion, that each member has the same governing 
law, and that, if followed up, each will be found to centre in 
volcanic agency. This position will,^ in future observations, 
be satisfactorily tested and proved : the arguments derived 
from that branch of the enquiry affecting animal life being 
the first general evidence to its truth. It is anticipating to 
say more, now, than that, if the. other cases bear out the as- 
sertion, the irruption of the mice in Scotland and Ireland, 
the incursion of the bears and cankerworms in Canada, and 
the movement amongst the boars of France, &c., all point 
out 1833 as a peculiar year; and to what are we to attribute 
these so recent occurrences, but to some result of that great 
cause which has shaken the earth, the sea, and the air, and 
rendered the last few months more memorable for earth-

But I pass on to a few remarks, not actually connected 
with the preceding one% but arising from the subject ; re- 
serving the full enquiry, as to the claims of J;833, to another 
occasion. .: - : . " 

I have stated alx)ve, that the want of^fish, to which the 
emigration of th« bears in 1817 (that remarkable yenr) is 
attributed, was "probably occasioned by some isubmarine 
convulsion." That fish are frequently affected by the dis- 
engagement of some invisible mephitic vapour, sometimes de- 
stroying them, and sometimes driving them awiiy.fi'om their 
natural haunts, is not difficult to be maintained. The British 
Channel has, since 1817, experienced two phenomena which, 
I believe, have never hitherto been recorded ; and, a& bearing 
on the topic before us, and exactly, in some points, paralleled 
by well-attested facts,. it may serve a double purpose. to state 
the particulars. • : 

A little before: Christmas, 1827, immense multitudes ;ofiish 
were found floating along the coast of Sussex (about Rye 
and Hastings) in a stnpijled and helpless state; and, at low 
water, .being unable to get back into the sea, were picked up 
by thousands at the water's edge. They were chiefly conger 
eels, many of enormous size, but several were fish 7iever before 
seen by thejisliermen. This lasted several days. The period 
in question was preceded by a thicJcfog. The cause assigned 
by the common people was, " a heavy fall of snow, with a 
south wind, which^ with frost and starlight nights, blirided the 
fish " ! ! ! I give these statements as I received them from my 
brother-in-law, Mr. Beaumont of Winchelsea, who had them 
from Mr. Tilden, of that place, who ate of the fish, as did 
hundreds of persons, without any bad- effect. 

On making enquiries, I have found that, about the end of Ja- 
nuary, or the beginning of February, 18.30, a similar occurrence 
took plac6 along the coasts of Dorset and Hants; and, as far as 
my inforniant*. recollects, do^-fish were very numerous. They 
were washed ashore, and collected in abundance f^s yboc?, at

200 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

The journals of the Philosophical Society have recorded 
an instance equally singular. In November, 1775, after an 
unparalleled drought, accompanied by universal and various 
sicknesses amongst the natives, a deyise fog settled over the 
island of Sumatra, the wind being constantly in the south, 
and, during its prevalence, it was observed that the sea round 
the island was covered by innumerable multitudes of dead 
and dying fish, of all kinds and sizes, the cat-fish and mullet 
being the most frequent. They were driven on the beach, 
for more than a month, by the tide, in prodigious numbers, 
and *mere eaten by the natives. Mr. Marsden, who relates 
the fact, endeavours to account for it by a isoant of the usual 
supply of fresh water to temper the salt ; an explanation worthy 
of the ichthyophagists of Sussex. Had the existence of vol- 
canoes and the frequent occurrence of earthquakes in the 
island been considered, perhaps the mortality amongst the 
fish might have been differently explained, by an excess of 
salts rather than an excess of salt. We are not without evi- 
dence to bear upon the most probable solution of this and 
the two preceding statements, which agree with the latter in 
all particulars as to the fog which prevailed, and the harmless 
state of the fish as food. I will not in this place say more of 
these fogs, nor of the diseases and drought in Sumatra at the 
time; but simply put them in countenance by a reference to 
what is related of the year 1348, when, according to the 
report of the College of Physicians of Paris,yb^5 during 28 
days, in the time of the great mortality, covered Arabia, India, 
Crete, Germany, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, corrupting the 
waters of the sea, so that the fish died. * 

We will come at once to an elucidation of these circum- 
stances. Sir W. Hamilton, in his account of the great earth» 
quakes, in Calabria, in 1783, says : — " A circumstance worth 

with oaths and imprecations, into the sea : and, ever since, the mackerel 
and some others have kept at a respectful distance. I have, in publishing 
this anecdote, no desire to offend the Nereids and Tritons of the Brown- 
sea Island oyster-beds : I quote it only as a jwssible instance of the phe- 
nomenon alluded to above. I may, however, safely state that there was 
scarcely ever a place, on so many waters, where (except a few harbour plaice) 
so few piscatory dehcacies were to be met with. When the corporation 
would fare sumptuously, they must reserve their banquet till the arrival of 
a Torquay boat, which occasionally, in bad weather, puts in here. I say 
this, though, with all deference to the myriads of salt cods and caplins 
from Newfoundland, whose odorous presence proves Poole to be a pisci- 
vorous "county." As the corporators are fond of " incorporations," they 
might endeavour to put our poissonaille on good terms with the authorities ; 
and propose an enactment by which, in future, the flat-fish and their neigh- 
bours may be on dining terms with the gastronomists.

remarking, and which was the same on the whole coast of 
Calabria that had been most affected by the earthquakes, is, 
that a small fish called cicirelli, resembling what we call in 
England white bait, but of a greater size, and "which usuallij 
lie at the bottom of the sea, buried, in the sand, have been, ever 
since the commencement of the earthquakes, and continue 
still to be, taken near the surface, and in such abundance, 
as to be the common food of the poorest sort of people; whereas, 
before the earthquakes, this fsh was rare, and reckoned 
amongst the greatest delicacies. All fsh, in general, have 
been taken m greater abundance, and with much greater faci- 
lity, in these parts, since they have been afflicted with earth- 
quakes, than before. 1 constantly asked every fisherman I 
met with on the coast of Sicily and Calabria, if this circum- 
stance was true; and was as constantly answered in the 
affirmative, but with such emphasis, that it must have been 
extraordinary. I suppose that either the sand at the bottom 
of the sea may have been heated by the volcanic fire under it, 
or that the continual tremor of the earth has driven the fish 
out of their strongholds." {Phil. Trans., vol. Ixxiii.) 

The same writer, describing the eruption of Vesuvius (in 
1 794), observes : — " A few days ago, a shoal of fish, of several 
hundred weight, having been observed by some fishermen, 
at Resina, in great agitation at the surface of the sea, near 
some rocks of an ancient lava that had run into the sea, they 
surrounded them with their nets, and took them all with ease, 
and afterwards discovered that they had been stunned by the 
mephitic vapour which at that time issued forcibly from under- 
neath the ancient lava into the sea. . . . The divers there 
(near Portici) likewise told me, that, for the space of a mile 
from that shore, since the eruption, they have found all the 
fish dead in their shells, as they supposed, either from the 
heat of the sand at the bottom of the sea, or from poisonous 
vapour." {Phil. Trans., 1795.) 

Mr. Wright of Glasgow visited Graham's Island on the 
20th Aug. 1831. He says, in the account published in the 
Penny Magazine (No. 114. for Jan. 4. 18S4, p. 10.), that the 
people with him found, on the south-east side of the island, on 
a strip of beach, " half dead and. stupified, a fine Aarge jicsce' 
spada, or swordfish. This they secured, and carried back 
with them to Sciacca, where they found it weighed upwards 
of 60 lbs. English. The fate of the fish," says Mr. W., 
" must have ixviseu from its coming too near the hot and con- 
taminated water, which on all sides surrounded the island to 
a greater or less distance." * 

* It is forestalling the subject, but it is right to add here, that my con- 
jectures respecting the s form of June 11. and 12. 1833, were realisedy by the 



202 Natural History and Political Impropriation 

During the great eruption of Lancerote, in 1731, all the 
banks and shores of the island were covered with dead and 
dying JisJi, many of kinds never before seen there, (Von Biich ; 
Lyell, vol. i. p. 381.) The putrid vapours were so great on 
the 28th October, that they fell down condensed in drops, 
suffocating the cattle, which dropped lifeless to the ground, 
(Lyell, L 381.) The eruptions of Iceland have very frequently 
slain the fish., (See Henderson and others.) 

We may presume, from these effects, that the phenomena 
in Sumatra in 1776, and in 1827 and 1830 in the British 
Channel, originated in some disengagement of mephitic vapour; 
and though in neither ease was an earthquake y^/^, still it is 
more than probable that earthquakes then and there occurred: 
and, -if it were not out of place now, I could adduce reasons 
(which will be stated hereafter) for concluding that the Bri- 
tish seas experienced some submarine convulsion in August 
and October, 1833. As, however, the object of this paper is 
to discuss the evidence from animated nature, we shall merely 
conclude it with observing, -that, according to the presumptive 
proof before us, the want of fish in the Kamtschatkan seas was 
occasioned by a disengagement of terrestrial heat ; and, if so, 
that the irruption of bears in Canada, considering the con- 
ditions of the year 1833, was occasioned by a similar object 
and cause. 

Whatever be decided, it is, I think, clearly established that 
this head of my argument is founded on sufficient evidence : 
and thus, for the present, I quit the subject, which will be 
resumed in subsequent Numbers. W. B. Clarke.

Art. II. Tads and Considerations on the Natural History and 
Political Impropriation of the Salmon Fish. By T. G., of 
Clitheroe, Lancashire. 

Sir, 

Introductorily to the remarks, corresponding to this title, 
which I have to communicate, I would give a description of 
fish of the genus Sklmo, which we have in the Kibble: it 
may enable some of your readers to comprehend more readily 
what is said afterwards. 

We have, first, the salmon, which, in the Ribble, varies in 

appearance of Grahavi's Islandy at that date^for the second time, at the sur- 
face of the sea, the steam and smoke rising furiously. (See Mag, Nat. 
Hist., VI. 307. [and IV. 545—550.]) 



of the Salmon Fish. 205 

weight from 5 lbs. to 30 lbs. We never see the fresh fish 
herev before May^ and then ve^'y rarelj^ j. a- few cqme in 
June, July^ and August, if there are high floods in the river; 
and in about the latter end of September they become tolerably 
abundant (the fisheries near the moudi of the river have then 
ceased for the season), and the sahnoii run very freely, up the 
river from that time to the middle or end of December. They 
begin to spawn at the latter end of October ; but the greater 
part of those that spawn here, do so. in December (I believe 
nearer tiie source of the river they are earlier) j but many fish 
are seen on the spawning beds in January, and I have even 
se^n a pair sO: late; as March ; but this last: is a very rare 
occurrence. Some of. the inale kippei's (kelts) come down in 
December and. January,; but the greater part of the females 
remain in the river until April, and they are oecasiojially seen, 
lierding with ^oals o.f stmelts, in Ma}^. Ji>^ this state they 
will take a worni.yery greedily, and arp, .many-of them, caught 
with the fly in the deeps ; Uut they are unfit to eat, the flesh 
being white, loose, and insipid, although they have lost the 
red dingy appearance which they had when about to spawn, 
and are almost as bright as the fresh fish : their -large heads 
and lank bodies, however, render it sufficiently easy to dis- 
tinguish them from fish which are only ascending the river, 
even if the latter were plentiful at this season ; but this is, un- 
fortunately, not the case. 

Secondly, We have the mort, I am not sure whether this 
fish is what is called the grilse in Scotland, or whether it is 
the sea trout of that country. It is a handsome fish, weighing 
from 1^ lb. to 3 lbs. We first see the morts in June, and from 
that time to the end of September they are plentiful, in favour- 
able seasons, in the Hodder (a tributary stream of the Ribble), 
although they are never numerous in the Ribble above the 
mouth of that river. It is the opinion of the fishermen here 
that this is a distinct species. My own opinion is that it 
is a young salmon ; and yet, if I were called upon to give 
reasons for thinking so, I could not offer any very conclusive 
pnes ; the best I have is, that there is no perceptible differ- 
ence in the fry when going down to the sea. It may be said, 
" How do you know that one of the three or four varieties of 
smelts,^ which, you describe farther on, is not the fry of the 
mort?" To this objection, if made, I say, that these varieties 
^xist intiie Wharfe, where, .o\ying either to natural or to 
artificial causes, there , is n^ver; either a mort or a sprod 
(whitling?) seen. 

Thirdly, We have the sprod^ which is, I believe, syno- 
nymous with the, whitling, whiting, or berling of Scotland. 



204 Natural History and Political Impropriation 

It is a beautiful fish, of 6 oz. or 8 oz. in weight, and has more 
of the appearance of the sahnon than the mort has. It seldom 
ascends the river before July, and, like the mort, is far more 
abundant in the Hodder than in the Ribble. This fish some- 
times rises pretty freely at the fly, and, when it does so, makes 
a very handsome addition to the angler's basket ; but at other 
times it is shy and difficult to hook. It disappears, in a great 
measure, about September. 

Fourthly, We have the pink, or par, which is found of two 
or three sizes in the Ribble : the largest are all males, and, 
in October, the milt in them is large. They are small fishes; 
varying in weight from 1 oz. to 3 oz. each ; and, as it is well 
remarked by the author of that delightful book, fVild Sports 
of the West, they have very much the appearance of hybrids 
between the salmon and the trout. They rise, very freely, at 
the fly and maggot, from July to October, and afford good 
sport to the angler who is satisfied with catching small fish. 
I trust I shall be able, in the following pages, to give some 
information respecting this fish, which will assist in dispelling 
the mystery in which its natural history has been enveloped. 

I will now mention a few of the opinions respecting the 
various species of salmon, and also my own, where they are 
at variance with the generally received ones, and give the 
facts and reasonings which have induced me to form those 
opinions ; and I shall be very glad, if I be in error on any of 
these points, if some one of your readers, better acquainted 
with the subject than I am, will take the trouble to set me 
right. 

It seems to be the opinion of many, indeed of most, per- 
sons, that the salmon spawns from November to February, 
and that the young fry, or smelts, go down to the sea in the 
April or May following. My own opinion is, that they stay 
in the rivers very much longer. The grilse is, by many, be- 
lieved to be a distinct species, whilst others stoutly maintain 
that it is a young salmon. 

The testimony of the witnesses from the Severn, the Wye, 
the Lee (near Cork), and the Ness (see the evidence given 
before the Select Committees of the House of Commons in 
1824 and 1825), would lead one to suppose that the fish were 
in the best season from November to March; whilst the evi- 
dence of the witnesses from the other parts of the kingdom 
goes to prove that this is the very worst period for catching 
them. One maintains that each river has its own variety of 
fish, which can be distinguished from the fish of any other 
river; another contends that there is no such difference: a 
third states that stake nets are exceedingly injurious to the 



of the Salmon Fish, 205 

breed of the fish ; and a fourth attests that stake nets only catch 
the fish when they are in the best season, that neither kelts 
nor fry are taken in them, and that, if they were prohibited, 
it would only be preserving the fish for the grampuses and 
seals : in short, the evidence, both regarding their habits and 
the best modes of catching them, having in view the pre- 
servation and increase of the breed, is so completely contra- 
dictory as to leave a doubt in the minds of every one who reads 
it, and has no other means of forming an opinion. I will 
endeavour to show, in some instances, which of these testi- 
monies are correct, and it will be for your readers to judge 
how far I succeed ; and I hope they will be so obliging as to 
correct any errors I may fall into. 

1st, It is my opinion that the fry of salmon are much older, 
when they leave the rivers, than seems to be generally sup- 
posed, and that the growth of this fish is by no means so rapid 
as it is considered to be by those who have written on the 
subject. For several years previous to 1816, the salmon were 
unable to ascend into the upper parts of the river Wharfe, 
being prevented either by the high weirs in the lower parts, 
or by some other cause : and, of course, there were no smelts 
or par : but in that year, either the incessant rains of that 
summer, or rumours of the formation of an association for the 
protection of fish, or some other unknown cause, enabled 
some salmon to ascend the river 30 or 40 miles, and to 
spawn there. In the next spring (1817), there were no 
smelts, but about September they began to rise at the very 
small flies which the anglers in that river make use of: they 
were then a little larger than minnows. In the spring of 
1818, there were blue smelts, or what are generally known 
as salmon fry, which went down to the sea in the May of that 
year : but these were only part of the brood, the females only ; 
the males remaining all that summer, being, at the period 
when the females went down, very much smaller than they, 
and what are called, in the Wharfe, grey smelts, and puiks 
or par elsewhere. I have shown that there were two migra- 
tions from the spawn of 1816 : but this was not all ; there still 
remained a few smelts through the summer of 1819, which by 
that time were from 4 oz. to 6 oz. in weight, and are known 
by the anglers there as brambling smelts : the blue marks on 
their sides are very distinct, and the fish a perfect smelt, ex- 
cept that it is considerably larger. It is quite different from the 
whitling, or sprod, which is not known in the Wharfe, at 
least not in the upper parts of that river, whilst the brambling 
is never seen in the Kibble. The brambling is a beautiful 
fish, and it rises very freely both at tlie May fly and the arti- 



206 Natural Histqrr^; and Political Impropriation 

ficial fly through; the summer ; it is also occasionally caught 
by anglers with the worm, on the salmon spawning-beds, in the 
autumn, with the milt perfectly developed, and in & fluid state. 
Although this fish; is not found: in the Ribble (as far as my 
observation and enquiries have gone), I believe that it is 
found in the Tweed (and perhaps also in other rivers running 
into the German Ocean) ; for a letter, addressed to Mr. Ken- 
nedy, who was chairman of the Select Committee appointed to 
investigate this, subject, by a Mr. George Houy, states, that 
the smelts are sometimes found there 10 in. long, which he 
attributes to their not being able to get down at the proper 
periqdj for; want of a flood in the river \ but J know that -in 
the Ribble smelts will go down to the sea without there being 
a flood at ^11, if that >flQod does not conje, within ten days or a 
fortnight of the time at which they usually descend to -ihe-sea. 
I also know that bramblings are found in the Wharfe in 
years when there has been no deficiency in that respect ; yet 
why they should be common in that river, when they are 
never met with in the Ribble, which has ten times as many 
salmon and smelts in it, I am unable to comprehend. 

It is my opinion that the eggs of the salmon are not hatched 
before March or April, Two anglers, who were, in April, 
wading in the river Wharfe, came upon a spawning-bed, 
which they had the curiosity to examine: they found a num- 
ber of eggs, in which they could see the young fry already 
alive, and one of them took these eggs home with him. By 
regularly and frequently supplying them with fresh water, he 
succeeded in hatching them, and kept some of the young 
fishes alive for some time; but they died in consequence of 
neglect, and were, even then, very diminutive. 

The opinion generally received in Scotland seems to be, 
if I may judge from the evidence given before the House of 
Commons, that smelts go down to the sea in the spring after 
they are spawned, and that they return, in the summer and 
autumn of the same year, as grilse. When they return, and 
what size they are of on their first visit, I have hitherto been 
unable to ascertain ; but I think I have succeeded in proving 
that they do not go to the sea so soon as is generally believed, 
nor do any of the witnesses give their reasons for thinking 
that they do. I should very much like to learn what evidence 
they have to offer in behalf of this opinion, I remember see- 
ing an article in the Scotsman (perhaps about 12 months ago), 
in which it was stated that Dr. Knox had made some im- 
portant discoveries in the natural history of the salmon and 
herring, both in their food and propagation ; and, if I recollect 
aright, it stated that he had ascertained that the eggs remained 



-- of the • Salmon Mish- - 2Q7 

several montlas in the gravely and that then, in a few idays or 
weeks^ aftei', lliey [the "fishes hatched from them] were so 
much grown as lo go. down to the sea; but none of the data 
which enabled him to arrive at this conclusion were given, and 
since then I havje heard nothing about the matter. As it is 
so long since I-Teacl_this article, I may have quoted it incor- 
i-ectly, but I believe that its substance was what 1 have stated. 
 The only conclusive evidence I can find about the hatching 
of salmon fry is that of Mr. Geo. Hogarth {Second Pari. Rep. 
p. 92.), and his account agrees with my own. He states that 
he took the salmon spawn from the spawning beds, and, by 
keeping it frequently supplied with fresh water, he succeeded 
in hatching some of the eggs (he gives drawings of the ap- 
pearance of the fry, in three or four different stages, from the 
egg to the age of eight days, see Appendix to Second Pari. 
Rep.) ; that the young fry, by keeping them well supplied with 
fresh water, were very lively and vigorous for three weeks, 
but that they, after this time, appeared to grow languid and 
uneasy, and, as they would eat nothing, they died when 1 in. 
long. Unfortunately, he does not state at what period of the 
year they were hatched ; but if this were in March or April, 
which I see no reason to doubt, it is sufficient to prove that 
they would not reach the size which smelts are when they 
leave the rivers for the sea ; for, supposing him to have hatched 
them in the last week in March, and that they lived a month, 
this would bring us to the time when they are about to mi- 
grate, at which time they average more than 6 in. long, many 
of them are 8 in. ; and at this period they are fond of feeding 
upon worms, flies, maggots, and caddis-worms, as is known 
to every schoolboy living on the bank of a river frequented 
by salmon. 

It is also my opinion that neither salmon nor trout spawn 
every year ; for salmon ascend the rivers as early as January, 
in the highest condition, with roe in them no bigger than 
mustard seed : these could not have spawned that season, as 
the kelts (particularly the females) do not return to the sea 
until March or April*, and at that time they are in very bad 
condition, and do not appear to have a particle of spawn in 
them ; and, in the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie [Second Pari. 
Rep., p. 21.), we have an account of a grilse kelt, which was 
caught, and marked, in March, 1823, and which was again 
caught as a salmon, on its return to the river, in March, 1824. 
In this case, the fish had evidently required a residence of

12 months in the sea before it was in a condition to visit the 
river a second time ; and, in the Wharfe, it is the constant 
practice of the anglers to catch trout through the winter, with 
very minute roe in them, and in high season, with the worm 
and sahnon roe, and also with night lines. In fact, one of the 
fishermen has frequently remarked to me, that he occasion- 
ally caught dishes of trout with the fly in January, in finer 
season than he has found them in April ; which he accounted 
for by saying that the spawned fish (kelts) of that season had 
not begun to rise freely at the fly at the former periods, but 
that they had at the latter, so that his pannier contained as 
many kelts as fresh fish. Another reason has just occurred 
to me : it is, that, in January, the spawned fish will still be in 
the small brooks in which they are so fond of breeding, and 
of course, the bulk of the fish remaining in the river at that 
period would be fish in good season. 

As it is some years since 1 acquired part of this inform- 
ation, I have felt afraid of giving it incorrectly; and I have, 
therefore, addressed a letter to a friend living on the banks of 
the Wharfe, requesting him to send me all the information 
in his possession on this subject, as well that derived from his 
own observation as that collected from others. He has, and 
since the above was written, sent me the following reply: — 

" I have seen R (one of the best anglers and fly-makers 

between Cornwall and Caithness), and have had some con- 
versation with him on the subject of salmon, &c. He is of 
opinion that the spawn of the salmon remains five months in 
the gravel before hatching. He examined the spawn in April, 

and found the young fry alive in the egg; and I m (another 

angler) took some home, and kept one of the smelts two or 

three months. I have subsequently seen I m, and he has 

given me the same account. All the fishermen here are of 
opinion that the female smelts remain one year, and the males 
two years, before they go down to the sea. The bramblings 
are supposed to be smelts which remain a year longer than 
the usual time ; they are few in nvunber, and are taken gene- 
rally with the May fly. I have no doubt that the above 
opinions are correct ; for we have now three distinct sizes of 
smelts in the river (exclusive of the bramblings), the largest 
of which are nearly 4oz. in weight, and are all males, as they 
contain milt in October and November. The next are the 
females of the present year : I have had one since the receipt 
of your letter, which weighed ^ oz., and measured 5 in. in 
length (this was a real blue smelt). The third are the males 
of the same age, and are much smaller : these are occasion- 



of the Salmon Fish. 209 

ally taken with the worm, and will rise at the fly all the next 
summer. 

" We were for several years (but I do not recollect the 
dates) entirely without salmon, and, of course, without smelts ; 
and we invariably found that the smelts made their appear- 
ance the year after the salmon, but were very small till the 
second year, when we had what we call blue smelts, which 
disappeared in May or June ; and what you call pinks, which 
remained till the following year ; and brambling smelts, which 
remained another year. The fishermen here are also of 
opinion, that neither salmon nor trout spawns every year. 

II says that one day lately" (the letter is dated Dec. 13.) 

" he caught seven trouts, six of which were in good season, 
and he brought me two the other day, one of which contained 
roe, and the other was in excellent condition." 

My friend states, in a subsequent communication, that one 
of the fishermen had told him that he had caught the male 
smelts (par) more abundantly on the salmon spawning-beds 
than elsewhere ; and my friend adds that the opinion there 
is, that, if a female salmon gets up, even if no male accom- 
panies her, yet her eggs are fecundated by the male smelts ; 
and they allege, in support of this opinion, that a female got 
up one season, and spawned, and, though no male was seen 
near her, her eggs were prolific. I mention this, although I 
apprehend that it is evidence which the unbelievers will con- 
sider inadmissible ; for, though no male was seen, still there 
may have been one ; or, admitting that one did spawn without 
being accompanied by a male, yet another, which contrived to 
bring her mate along with her, may have spawned in the same 
place the same season : yet, notwithstanding its liability to 
these objections, I have no doubt myself that, if a female 
were to come alone, her eggs would be impregnated by the 
par. It is an excellent maxim that nature makes no useless 
provisions ; yet, if we admit that par are young salmon, for 
what purpose is the milt, if not to impregnate salmon roe ? and, 
if we deny this to be the fact, we must endeavour to show that 
there are female par; but in all my examinations I have never 
been able to meet with one that contained roe. 

That the Grilse are Salmon is proved, I think, sufficiently, 
by the evidence given before the House of Commons. Mr. 
Wm. Stephen states {Second Rep., p. 52.) that he has known 
grilse kept in a saltwater pond until they had become salmon, 
and that fry that had been marked came back that year as 
grilse, and the year after as salmon ; and Mr. George Ho- 
garth states that he has as often seen a salmon and a grilse 
working together on the spawning beds, as two salmon or 
Vol. VII. — No. 39. p 



210 Natural History and Political Impropriation 

two grilse; and Mr. Mackenzie states (p. 21.) that he, in 
Marcli, 1823, marked a grilse kelt with brass wire, and 
caught it again, m March, 1824, a salmon of 7 lb, weight. 
The testimony of the witnesses from the Ness, the Severn, 
the Lee, and some other rivers, is too positive, and too well 
supported, to admit of any doubt as to the excellent season 
[condition] of many of the fish ascending those rivers in 
November, December, and January ; a period when they are 
out of season, and full of spawn, generally, and even when 
many fish are caught in those rivers in the same unseason- 
able condition. The fact, that there are many fish in fine 
season in those months, may be, I think, accounted for, if we 
admit that salmon only spawn every other year, which I have, 
I think, shown to be very probable; but what it is that in- 
duces those fish to ascend rivers so many months before the 
spawning season I cannot explain. Probably there may be 
some quality in the water of these rivers, all the year, which is 
congenial to the habits of the fish, while the same quality 
may only be found during part of the year in others. It is 
certain that the quality of the water in rivers generally varies 
very much with the season : thus, the water of the Ribble is, 
after a flood, in summer, always of a dark brown colour, 
being so coloured by the peat moss over which it passes; 
while in winter no such tinge can be observed ; and there 
may be other differences, with which we are unacquainted. 
However, whether this is the true reason or not, it certainly 
cannot be that the fish which spawn in October are impelled 
by their desire to propagate their species to ascend the rivers 
the January before ; and if this long residence in fresh water 
were necessary for the proper developement of the ova 
in one river, we might suppose it would be necessary in all ; 
yet this is not the case; as the red fish, which ascend the 
rivers in November and December, have, at that time, the 
spawn nearly ready for exclusion. 

On one point, about which there is great difference of 
opinion, namely, whether the fish which are bred in a river 
generally resort to it, and whether each river has its own 
variety of fish, I am not a competent judge, as I am ac- 
quainted with too few rivers to pretend to decide. I may, 
however, just remark that the Hodder, though it is a much 
smaller river than the Ribble, is always much better stocked 
with salmon, morts, sprods, smelts, and par, than is the latter 
river ; which I attribute to the fact that more fish spawn in 
the Hodder, as it runs for many miles through the Forest of 
Bowland (the property of the Duke of Buccleugh) and other 
large estates, and the fish are much better protected there 



of the Salmon Fish. 2 1 1 

than in the Ribble, where, with one or two exceptions, the 
properties are very much divided, and few people think it 
worth their while to trouble themselves on the subject. 

Dr. Fleming, in his letter to Mr. Kennedy {Appendix to 
the First Rep.^ 1825), seems to doubt that salmon enter rivers 
for any other purpose than that of propagation : but, lest I 
should misrepresent his opinions, I will quote what he has said 
on the subject : — "In the evidence taken before the Select 
Committee, during the last session of parliament, and appear- 
ing in the Report, there are several statements, of a somewhat 
imposing kind, which, as they appear to me to be erroneous 
and apt to mislead, I shall here take the liberty of opposing 
them." He then enumerates several opinions expressed 
before the Select Committee ; one of which is, " that salmon 
enter and leave rivers for other purposes than those con- 
nected with spawning." (See the evidence of Messrs. Little, 
Halliday, and Johnstone.) 

" 1st. That they enter rivers to rid themselves of sea lice 
(Monoculus joiscinus). 2dly, that they forsake rivers to save 
themselves from being exhausted by residence in fresh water, 
and from having their gills devoured by a maggot (Lernae^a 
^almonea). The whole natural history of the salmon contra- 
dicts this hypothesis." Another of these " errors " is, " that 
Mt is asserted {Rep,.^ 1824, p. 145.) that salmon always 
return to the same river.' This is not probable, when we 
consider the circumstances in which they are placed during 
their residence in the sea." On the first of these opinions I 
am not a competent judge ; but I think that the fact, that 
salmon enter rivers nine or ten months before they are ready 
to spawn, is of itself sufficient to show that there are other 
reasons for their entering rivers than those connected with 
propagation. With respect to the second, I believe that, 
after salmon have once entered rivers, at least when they 
have ascended into the upper parts of them, they never 
offer to descend again until they have spawned. On the 
third opinion, I would remark, that although I do not think 
that salmon altscays come to the same river in which they 
were bred, yet I think that they will do so if they can : and I 
think that the fact which I have mentioned, of the Hodder (a 
smaller and a tributary stream of the Ribble) containing 
many more salmon, as well as more morts and sprods, coun- 
tenances this supposition : for why should the larger number 
of fish ascend the smaller river, except for such a reason ? 

I am of opinion that Salmon do not grow so fast iii the Sea 
as is generally supposed. It is here generally believed that 
the smelts which go down in the spring come up again in 

p 2 



212 Natural History and Political Impropriation 

the August and September following, 5 lb. or 6 lb. in weight ; 
and George Little, Esq., in his evidence, states this as his 
opinion ; but he does not give any other reason for it than 
this, that the grilse that ascend the rivers in June, weigh 
Ijlb. to 2 lb., and that those which come in September 
weigh 5 lb. or 6 lb. But opposed to this supposition is the 
evidence of Mr. Mackenzie, before referred to (Second Pari, 
Rep.i p. 21.), who states that he caught, in March, a grilse 
kelt which weighed 3 J lb. ; that he marked it with a brass 
wire, and let it go; and that, in the March following, he 
caught it again, a salmon of 7 lb. weight. Now, a fish 
which weighed Sj lb. as a kelt, would weigh 5 lb. or 6 lb. 
when in high condition the summer before ; and if this 
were so, which, I believe, all persons who are acquainted 
with salmon will admit, this fish would appear to have gained 
only 1 lb. or 2 lb. in fifteen or eighteen mondis. Besides, if 
salmon grow as fast as is stated and believed by many 
persons, the breeds of different years would vary very 
much in weight; whereas it is known to every body that we 
have them of all sizes, from 5 lb. to 40 lb. ; and it is very 
contrary to analogy to suppose that a fish, which is two or 
three years in arriving at the weight of as many ounces, 
should, in two or three months, acquire as many pounds. 

There are, however, two or three things, about which all 
persons agree in opinion. One of these is, that the breed of 
salmon is decreasing every year^ and that the great cause of 
this decrease is the want of protection, and a consequent de- 
struction, of the fish in the spawning season. The complaint 
on this head is universal; from north to south, from the Shan- 
non to the Tweed, the cry is. Protect the breeding fish, or we 
shall very soon have none to protect : and yet, although the 
destruction of the fish in the spawning season, and the de- 
struction of the fry in the spring, are the chief reasons for this 
alarming falling off, yet no one seems able to devise a remedy. 
The fact is, no one seems inclined to make the necessary 
sacrifices for so desirable an object ; and, without these sacri- 
fices, it would be absurd to expect the fish to become plen- 
tiful; and, instead of furnishing an abundant supply of cheap 
and wholesome food to all classes, which they certainly would 
do if the fisheries were properly regulated, they will become 
either wholly extinct, or so rare as to be only found at the 
tables of the wealthy. James Gillies, in his evidence, states, 
that his brother had, in one night, killed in the Tweed, four 
hundred salmon at one landing-place^ in close time ; and all the 
reports are full of statements showing how unceasing and 
universal is the persecution the salmon undergo, not only 
when in season, but at all times, and most of all when every 



of the Salmon Fish, 2 1 3 

one should do his utmost to preserve them ; I mean, when 
they are spawning. In this neighbourhood, the properties, 
generally, are so much divided, and so few good fish are 
allowed to ascend the river, that no one has any interest in 
protecting them in close time; and the consequence is, as 
might be expected, that all sorts of contrivances for taking 
them are resorted to. They are speared and netted in the 
streams by day and night; they are caught with the fly; 
they are taken with switch hooks (large hooks fixed to the 
ends of staves), or with a triple hook fixed to the end of the 
running line attached to a salmon rod. If the river becomes 
low, parties of idle fellows go up each side of it in search of 
them, and, by stoning the deeps, or dragging a horse's skull, 
or large bone of any kind, through them, they compel the fish 
to the side, and they there fall an easy prey, in most cases, 
where the pool is of small extent. In a river so small as the 
Ribble, it will be readily believed that not many fish can 
deposit their spawn in safety, when practices of this sort are 
followed, almost openly, and where no one feels a sufficient 
interest in the matter to endeavour to put a stop to them. A 
single party of poachers killed 400 salmon in one spawning 
season, near the source of the river, the roe of which, when 
potted, they sold for 20/. Need we be surprised, then, if the 
breed decreases ? The only wonder is that they have not 
been exterminated long ago. 

I may, perhaps, be allowed to say what, in my opinion, 
would remedy this alarming destruction, particularly as no 
one seems hitherto to have devised an efficient preventive. I 
believe that, in 1826, there was an act of parliament passed 
which legalised the use of stake nets, and either repealed or 
modified some of the old laws on the subject ; and I have 
also understood that the good effects of this new law are 
already perceptible in Scotland, to which it exclusively ap- 
plied. There was a bill introduced into parliament, in 1825, 
which was intended to apply to the whole kingdom ; but 
some of the clauses were so very objectionable, that, if they 
had been carried, it could not possibly have been enforced 
without stopping and ruining the manufactures which were 
carried on by water power ; and the bill was consequently 
abandoned. The first thing to be done is, to give the pro- 
prietors on the upper parts of the rivers such an interest in the 
fisheries as will make them anxious about the preservation of 
the fish in the spawning season ; and, to accomplish so desir- 
able an object, no one ought to fish or keep a net stretched 
across a river for more than twelve hours a day, or from sun- 
rise to sunset ; and every mill-owner ought to be compelled 

1' 3 



214 Natural History and Political Impropriation 

to facilitate the passage of the fish over his weirs by every 
means consistent with the proper supply of water to his 
wheels. At present the fisheries at the mouths and lower parts 
of rivers so completely prevent the access of the fish to the 
upper parts, that, unless there happen to be high floods, which 
prevent the fishermen below keeping their nets in, the upper 
proprietors comparatively seldom see any until the season is 
out. The evidence before the House of Commons on this 
point is exceedingly amusing. One person thinks that the 
upper proprietors have no right to expect any fish, as they 
have never paid any consideration for any when they bought 
their estates : another states that he pays 7000/. a year to the 
Duke of Gordon ; and that, if he is compelled to observe a 
*weekly (not a daily) close time, he will lose that proportion 
of his rent ; another observes the weekly close time, and 
opens a passage for the fish, but places a crocodile, painted 
in very glaring colours, in the gap, to frighten them back 
again ; another says he observes the weekly close time in his 
cruive fishing, but no one is allowed to inspect the cruives ; 
another sends men to break down stake nets in the eshiary, 
which reach from high to low water mark, and at the same 
time stretches a net completely across the river ^ from March 
to August, so that not a fish can pass without his permission. 
No wonder if fish are scarce in the upper parts of rivers, 
when such samples of disinterestedness are manifested by the 
proprietors of the fisheries below. No wonder that the 
upper proprietors should be careless about the protection of 
fish from which they are not allowed to derive any benefit. 
No wonder that they should connive at, and even encourage, 
the shameful destruction of the fish in close time, since that is 
the only time they are allowed to have any. Let the fisher- 
men below make it worth the while of the upper proprietors 
to protect fish, and they will receive that protection ; but it is 
too much to expect from human nature that they will take 
all the odium and trouble of preserving them, when other 
parties reap all the benefit. 

There ought to be conservators employed to see that the 
fisheries are properly regulated; and these men should be 
paid by an assessment on all the proprietors, in proportion to 
the value of their fisheries. 

I should also recommend an extension and uniformity of 
close time in all the rivers in the kingdom ; for, although it is 
an undoubted fact that some clean fish are caught in rivers 
early in the season, yet they are comparatively few in number, 
and the capture of them involves that of a far greater number 
of spawning and kelt fish, which are not only of no value for 
the table, but the destruction of which is, in effect, the de- 



of the Salmon Fish. 215 

struction of the millions of fish wliich would proceed from 
them. In the First Par. Bep., p. 11., Mr. Walter Jamieson 
says, that, in the river Tweed, from January 10. to Fe- 
bruary ]., he caught 121 fish, only one of which had 
spawned; from February 1. to March 1., he took 44 fish, 
25 of which had not spawned, 15 were kelts, and 4 were 
clean fish ; from March 1. to March 10. he took 17 fish, 7 of 
which had not spawned (4 of them on the lOth), 9 were kelts, 
and 1 clean fish. Now, the close time varies in almost every 
river, and some have no close time at all. Thus, in the 
Ribble, the close time begins on September 15. and ends on 
December 31.; and in the Hodder there is no legal close 
time : but there is no practical difference between them in 
this respect, every one thinking himself entitled to kill every 
fish he can, at all times of the year, in both of them. 

The observance of the weekly close time (that is, opening 
a passage for the fish from sunset on Saturday night to sun- 
rise on' Monday morning) is a mere farce, even if it could not 
be evaded, as it almost invariably is ; for it is well known to 
every one conversant with the habits of salmon, that they 
only ascend rivers when there are freshes (floods) in them ; 
and, in the summer, the ground is generally so dry, and 
vegetation absorbs so much moisture, and the evaporation is 
so great, that it not only requires twice as much rain to pro- 
duce a flood in a river then, as it does in the winter, but, 
when rain does come, its effects are only visible in the river 
for a short time. I have known a strong fresh in the Ribble 
in the morning, and the river low again in the afternoon of 
the same day. Now, a fresh coming at the beginning of a 
week would disappear long before the close of it, unless the 
rainy weather continued ; and thus the strict observance of 
the weekly close time would be of little service to the upper 
proprietors, unless the fresh came at the right end of the 
week. 

The smelts and par ought to be protected as strictly as the 
salmon ; and there ought to be a penalty attached to the 
killing of them, or having them in possession ; and conservators 
of rivers ought to have the power of inspecting all mills and 
manufactories driven by those rivers, to ascertain that they 
have no contrivances for taking the fry on their way to the 
sea, as it appears that, in some rivers, they are taken in large 
quantities. There ought also to be a penalty attached to the 
killing of kelt fish, which, in that state, are not only tasteless 
and insipid, but actually unwholesome : yet they are pursued 
and destroyed with as much avidity as the fresh fish ; and a 
very small number of the very few that spawn in safety ever 



^ 1 6 Natural Historij and Political Impropriation 

return to the sea. A penalty ought also to be inflicted for 
selling, buying, using, or having in possession salmon roe, 
either in a fresh or salted state ; as its excellence as a bait for 
trout and eels, and the consequent high price at which it 
sells, are sufficient temptations to the poachers to kill the 
salmon in the spawning season, even if they could not sell or 
use any other part. Yet, destructive as this practice is, there 
is an extensive trade in this article, a fishing-tackle maker in 
Liverpool having told a friend of mine, that he sold 300 lb. 
weight in a season ; which, supposing every ^g'g to hatch, 
would produce, perhaps, five times as many salmon as are 
caught, in one year, throughout the whole kingdom. * 

In concluding this imperfect sketch, I may remark that I 
have omitted many things concerning the natural history and 
habits of the salmon, fearing that I should trespass too much 
on your space and the patience of your readers ; but I have 
wished, in addition to the communicating of some facts in the 
natural history of this fish, which, I believe, are not generally 
known, to call the attention of the public to the present state 
of the salmon fisheries in England. Many of the preceding 
observations are founded on the evidence of persons connected 
with the fisheries in Scotland, and are, perhaps, no longer 
applicable to that part of the kingdom, since there has been 
an alteration in the laws. Whether this is the case or not, 
1 have no present means of ascertaining. 1 shall be glad if 
any one having a knowledge of the subject will say what 
benefit (if any) has been derived from the alteration. How- 
ever, it is sufficient for my present purpose to show what is 
the state of things where there are no laws on the subject, or, 
which is the same thing, where there is no attention paid to 
them ; a state of things which, instead of promoting an abun- 
dant supply of these excellent fish, and rendering the salmon 
fisheries nationally important, tends, by the habitual disregard 
of the laws by one party, the selfishness of another, and the 
neglect of a third, to render these fisheries of little and still 
decreasing value; whereas, if the lower proprietors would 
allow a tolerable supply of the salmon to come up the rivers 

* Salmon are said to produce 18,000 or 20,000 eggs each, and I have 
no doubt a large salmon will produce still more ; as one I examined a year 
or two ago, of about 10 lb. weight, had a roe which weighed 2 lb. 9 oz.; 
and the skin in which the eggs were enveloped (they were not in the loose 
state in which they are found just before exclusion) weighed 3oz. after all 
the eggs were washed from it ; so that there were 38 oz. of eggs. I weighed 
50 of them, and found that they weighed 65 grains. At that rate, 38 oz. 
would give 12,788, and 300 lb. 1,615,000; but, as they would be much 
lighter when dried and potted, than when taken from the belly of the fish, 
we may safely estimate that the 300 lb. would contain 2,000,000 : a pro- 
iligious number to pass through the hands of one tackle-maker in a season. 



of the Salmon Fish, 2 1 7 

when they were worth taking, and the upper ones would 
preserve them during close time, there would be plenty for 
each and for all. 

I am aware that it will be difficult to legislate on this 
subject, without injury to what is of infinitely greater import- 
ance, I mean the manufactures of the country. The absurd 
and impracticable clauses which were contained in the bill 
for the protection of the fisheries, which was introduced into 
parliament in 1825, show this. Yet, notwithstanding this 
difficulty, I think it is possible to protect the fish, without 
interfering with the interest of the mill-owners ; and to make 
such laws on the subject as will be effectual, without calling 
forth a single objection from any unprejudiced person. I 
shall be glad if what I have said on this subject should in- 
duce any gentleman to turn his attention to it. There must 
be many whose opportunities of observation will enable them 
to determine whatever is doubtful in the natural history of 
the salmon tribe ; whose experience will teach them the defects 
and absurdities of the present laws on the fisheries; and 
whose influence w ill, if they can be induced to exert it, mate- 
rially contribute to the amendment of them.

[A SERIES of questions, by SirWm. Jardine, designed to elicit

was supplied to us, under date of May 29. 1830, by our

believe, however, that the different species of salmon have 
different periods of spawning. At Warkworth, where there is 
a fishery upon the Coquet, Northumberland, I find that they 
appear in numbers at different times, the least valuable kinds 
the latest (such as the grey and bull trout), and that they 
appear in the same order every year." — March 31.

testimony in favour of this fact [the asserted very rapid growth 
of the salmon] is very strong, one is, of course, induced to 
give credence to it. At the same time I am bound to admit, 
from observations made on the large quantity of salmon 
which our numerous fishmongers exhibit from March to Sep-

growth of salmon is overrated." The grounds of this opinion

Art. III. Ayi Introduction to the Natural History of Molluscous 
Animals. In a Series of Letters. By G. J. 

Letter 13- On their Food and Diprestive Organs. 

In reference to the present subject, I shall divide mollus- 
cous animals into three classes : — Ist, those which take their 
food in a liquid form, or suspended in water ; 2dly, those which 
are more properly carnivorous ; and, 3dly, those which feed 
on vegetable matters. 

To the first class all the Mollusca tanicata belong, and the 
tenants of the bivalved shells. There is no one of either of 
these extensive tribes which is furnished with any organ 
adapted to the capture or arrestment of prey, or with jaws or 
teeth to tear and masticate it ; and, as the greater number are 
immovably fixed to one spot for life, or are only capable of 
such motions as raise or depress them in their furrows, they 
are necessarily content to await what moist nutriment is brought 
within reach of their lips by the waves and currents of the 
circumfluent waters. The Mollusca tunicata have the power 
of enlarging the capacity of their large branchial sac ; and it 
is probable that, during this action, a portion of water rushes 
in, with all its contained animalcules, which serve for the food 
of the individual. I have found, in the sac of some of the 
compound and smallest species (v4Icy6neae), myriads of very 
minute corpuscles, which I believed to be entomostracous 
insects ; and Savigny, who has frequently made the same 
observation, has found, in the sac of species of the same 
tribe, crustaceous insects of a higher order and greatly larger 
dimensions. The latter, however, as Cuvier thinks, may have 
entered against the will and to the prejudice of the molluscum ; 
for he has observed the delicate texture of the viscera torn 
and ruptured by such rude ingesta. (Mem., xx. p. l^.) 

Of the Mollusca tunicata there are two families : one, Al- 
cyoneae, or the social, in which numerous individuals, generally 
of very small size, are united together, and, as it were, im- 
mersed in a common somewhat gelatinous mass ; and another, 
Ascidiae, or the solitary, in which every individual is single 
and separate, and of much greater magnitude [see figs. 24. and 
25. p. 129, 130. of the preceding Number]. In both of these 
families, the mouth is a circular aperture, raised a little above 
the surface of the common integument or sac, and is capable 
of being shut or opened, more or less widely, at the pleasure 
of the animal. The rim of it is sometimes plain, and some- 
times cut into four, six^ or eight equal segments ; and within 
the orifice there is, in very many of them, a fringe formed of 
one or two rows of delicate cilia, which I have observed, in 
the Ascidia rustica, to be in constant and quick vibration 



their Food ajid Digestive Orgaiis, 219 

when the animal was left undisturbed. I presume them to be 
organs of a very delicate irritability, perhaps of taste * ; and 
that their purpose is to hinder the ingress of noxious matters, 
not altogether mechanically, but because the sudden contrac- 
tion of the oral aperture is a necessary sequence of their 
unpleasant irritations.f This aperture leads directly into the 
branchial sac, which, besides its office of a respiratory organ, 
seems to perform in part that also of a stomach ; for that the 
process of digestion commences there, seems obvious from the 
fact, that numerous animalcules are generally found in it, but 
are never to be detected in the viscera of the abdomen. At 
the base of this sac there is another aperture (called by Cuvier 
the mouth), which conducts us, through the medium of a 
narrow membranous tube or oesophagus, into the proper sto- 
mach : an organ always much smaller than the branchial sac, 
very variable in point of situation and form, generally puckered 
into longitudinal plaits internally, and sometimes studded with 
some glandular bodies; but its minute structure cannot be 
ascertained with any degree of accuracy. It contains, in 
general, only a little liquid X ; while the intestinal canal, on 
the contrary, is almost, in every instance, filled throughout 
with a sufficiently consistent matter, sometimes grumous, 
more often homogeneous, of a yellowish grey colour, and* 
rolled into little round or egg-shaped pellets, which it behoves 
us not to mistake for the proper ova. This canal is usually 
wide, and has a flexuous course ; at first descending in the 
common sac, and then returning upon itself, it winds along 
the anterior side of the branchial sac, to open outwardly by a 
round aperture placed near the mouth, but distinguished by 
its lesser prominence. In the ^lcy5neae, it is otherwise like 
the mouth in form and structure ; but, in Ascidise, there is no 
filamentous fringe at this orifice ; which is furnished, instead, 
either with two valvular folds, or with a simple circular plait. 
In many of the solitary Ascidia?, the stomach is enveloped 
in a large liver §, which pours the bile directly into it through 

* " The disposition of the alimentary canal determines, in a manner 
perfectly absolute, the kind of food by which the animal is nourished ; but 
if the animal did not possess, in its senses and organs of motion, the means 
of distinguishing the kinds of aliment suited to its nature, it is obvious it 
could not exist." (Cuvier, Camp. Anat., vol. i. p. 55. trans.) 

-|- " II est garni d'une rangee de filamens charnus, ou de tentacules tres- 
fins, qui servent sans doute a I'animal powr I'avcrtir des objets nuisables 
qui pourroient se presenter et qu'il doit repousser." (Cuvier, Mcvi.y xx. 

X From this circumstance Savigny infers that the more gross and indi- 
gestible parts of the food are regurgitated, as they are in some nocturnal 
birds of prey. (^Mcm. sur Ics Animaux sans Vert.y vol.ii. p. 8.) 

$ In Boltcnia there is no liver. (Savigny's Mcm.y vol. ii. p. 88.) 



220 Natural Hhtory of Molluscous Animals : — 

several orifices ; and, in others, the parietes of the intestine 
are also thickened by a glandulous tissue, which probably 
secretes some liquor essential to proper digestion : but there 
is no liver in the social ^Icyoneas, or only some obscure traces 
of it in a few species, as in Diazona viohicea ; to the intestine 
of which, a little underneath the |)ylorus, are appended some 
little greenish tubes, simple, bifid, or trifid, which, Savigny 
conjectures, may be hepatic. {Mem.^ vol. ii. p. 37.) There is 
also an essential difference in the position of the viscera in the 
two families : the Ascidiaj have the abdominal viscera applied 
entirely against one of the sides of the branchial sac, beyond 
the base of which they do not project ; on the contrary, the 
abdominal viscera of the ^Icyoneai are without and under the 
sac from which they are dependent, and often separated by a 
distinct pedicle, the terminal portion of the intestine being the 
only part which is connected with the thorax. There are, 
however, some intermediate species to show that this dis- 
tinction is one of inconsiderable importance in their economy. 
The Bivalved Mollusca present some material differences in 
the structure of their alimentary canal. The mouth is always 
separate from the branchial aperture, and leads only to the 
proper stomach ; it is very wide, never cut into starlike seg- 
ments, nor guarded interiorly with ciliary segments, but, on 
the outside, is furnished with four compressed lobes, which 
seem to perform the office of lips rather than of tentacula * ; 
and serve, by their constant play, to force the nutrient fluids 
into the mouth ; for these are not sucked in with the current, 
but swallowed by the muscular efforts of the gullet. These 
labial appendages are triangular in shape, and very variable 
in size; they are scored, particularly on the inner surface, in 
the manner of the branchiae, with which their connection is 
often very intimate; and they are almost always very soft, and 
directed backwards; but, in the Nucula, they are rigid, and 
pointed towards the mouth, simulating a sort of jaws. (Blain- 
ville, Man., p. 121.) The anal aperture, unlike that of the 
Tunicata, is situated on the side of the body opposite to the 
mouth, and opens into a common excrementitious tube, the 
external orifice of which is often surrounded with a fringe of 
numerous short tubercles or fleshy filaments. The liver is 
always present, and closely invests the stomach, into which 
the bile is poured through several large pores ; and, in the 

* Cuvier expresses a different opinion. " Aux cotes de la bouche sont 
quatre autres feuillets triangulaires, qui sont les extremites des deux levres, 
et servent de tentacules." (lieg. Anim.^ vol. iii. p. 1 17.) [" At the sides of 
the mouth are four triangular leaves, which form the extremities of the 
two hps, and serve for tentacula."]

latter, we find a stylet or cylinder of firm gelatine lying loosely 
detached, but of a size which seems more than equal to plug 
up the passage. Of the use of this body, as well as of the 
mode of its formation, Biainville acknowledges his total 
ignorance. 

To give you a clearer idea of the course of the alimentary 
canal in this class of animals, I will copy, on a reduced scale, 
Sir E. Home's figure of it, taken from the freshwater muscle. 
In this figure (Jig, 37.)) ^ is the mouth, into which a bristle 




has been introduced, h the stomach, after which you will ob- 
serve that the intestine makes five turns in the foot amidst the 
ovary, and then, as rectum, runs posteriorly along the back 
of the animal beneath the hinge and above the respiratory 
organs, passing through the midst of the heart at c, and open- 
ing at d above the posterior muscle closing the shells, beneath 
the small tube of the cloak. This description applies gene- 
rally to most bivalves, but in the oyster the rectum does not 
pass through the heart. (Cams, Comp, AnaLftrana. vol.ii. p. 7.) 
Our knowledge of the food of bivalves may be considered 
as almost entirely conjectural. It seems, however, to have 
been ascertained, that oysters feed upon infusory animalcules; 
and, as it has been asserted, that while various species of these 
are beneficial, others are actually injurious, it seems to follow 
that oysters must be able to distinguish and reject the latter. 
(Zool, Jotirn,, vol. i. p. 581.) Other bivalves are probably 
nourished by similar animalcules ; for, when we reflect on 
their apparently helpless and inert condition, hampered with 
their shells, or even bound to the rock, we cannot but per- 
ceive that they are all unfit for the capture of any other prey 
than what floats about and within them. And how abun- 
dantly is this furnished ! There are everywhere scattered on 



222 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

the bed of the wide ocean extensive beds of oysters, clams, 
muscles, &c., containing millions of individuals, which are 
hourly devouring, each of them, crowds of animalcules (em- 
bracing in the term the infusory, microscopic, crustaceous 
and gelatinous medusae), which, from their vast numbers and 
rapid reproduction, never fail them. At some seasons 
of the year I have seen the waters of our shores literally 
in a move with Entomostraca ; and I am fully satisfied 
that, when Scoresby calculated a cubical mile to contain 
23,888,000,000,000,000, he was not exaggerating the actual 
fact. * In one family of bivalves furnished with a byssus, we 
frequently find entangled amid its fibres, or concealed within 
the valves, one or more small crabs (Pinnoteres), of which 
the older naturalists, who never left an observation to stand, 
like truth, all naked, but ever clothed it with some pretty 
vestment, tell us a tale not to be passed over in this place, 
and which I present you in the words of Dr. Philemon Hol- 
land, the laborious translator of Pliny. " The Nacre, also 
called Pinnae, is of the kind of shell fishes. It is alwaies 
found and caught in muddie places, but never without a 
companion, which they cal Pinnoter, or Pinnophylax. And 
it is no other but a little shrimpe, or, in some places, the 
smallest crab, which beareth the Nacre companie, and waites 
vpon him for to get some victuals. The nature of the Nacre 
is to gape wide, and sheweth vnto the little fishes her seelie 
body, without any eie at all. They come leaping by & by 
close vnto her ; and seeing they haue good leaue, grow so 
bardie & bold, as to skip into her shel and fill it ful. The 

* " The number of medusae in the olive-green sea was found to be im- 
mense. They were about one fourth of an inch asunder. In this propor- 
tion, a cubic inch of water must contain 64; a cubic foot, 110,592; a 
cubic fathom, 23,887,872; and a cubical mile about 23,888,000,000,000,000! 
From soundings made in the situation where these animals were found, it 
is probable the sea is upwards of a mile in depth ; but whether these sub- 
stances occup}' the whole depth is uncertain. Provided, however, the 
depth to which they extend be but 250 fathoms, the above immense number 
of one species may occur in a space of two miles square. It may give a 
better conception of the amount of medusae in this extent, if we calculate 
the length of time that would be requisite, with a certain number of persons, 
for counting this number. Allowing that one person could count 1,000,000 
in seven days, which is barely possible, it would have required that 80,000 
persons should have started at the creation of the world, to complete the 
enumeration at the present time! — What a stupendous idea this fact gives 
of the immensity of creation, and of the bounty of Divine Providence, in 
furnishing such a profusion of life in a region so remote from the habitations 
of men ! But if the number of animals in a space of two miles square be 
so great, what must be the amount requisite for the discoloration of the sea, 
through an extent of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 square miles ! " ( Scoresby's 
Arctic RegionSy vol.i. p. 179.)

shrimp lying in spiall, seeing this good time 
& opportunitie, giueth token thereof to the 
Nacre, secretly with a little pinch. She hath 
no sooner this signall, but she shuts her 
mouth, & whatsoever was within, crushes 
& kills it presently; & then she deuides 
the bootie with the little crab or shrimp, 
her sentinell and companion. I maruell 
therefore so much the more at them who 
are of opinion, that fishes and beasts in 
the water haue no sense." (Vol. i. p. 261.) 
Of bivalves there are some which, as I 
have told you, bore into wood and rocks ; 
but I need scarcely guard you against en- 
tertaining the supposition that they eat the 
material on which they work, although 
there are authors who have attributed to 
them " a stone-eating power and appe- 
tite." The Teredines, however, really eat 
the wood destroyed by them ; for Mr. Hat- 
chett proved the pulp in their intestine 
to be vegetable sawdust ; but I agree with 
Sir E. Home in thinking that the saw- 
dust serves only as a substance in which 
the real food procured from the sea is 
entangled and prevented from escaping too 
readily from the stomach. I will give you 
Sir Everard's description of the digestive 
organs {^g. 38.) of these animals, which a 
comparison will prove to be altogether 
different from those of the more typical bi- 
valved MoUusca {Jig'S7.)- The oesophagus 
{Jig. 38.* a) is now very short, and lies 
on the left side of the neck : the canal 
swells out,and becomes stomach (Z>), which, 
in its external appearance, is a large bag, 
extending the whole length of the cavity 
of the abdomen, but, when laid open, it is 
found to have a septum {c) dividing it

The intestine has its origin close to the termination of the

a hard white spherical body the size of a pin's head, and then 
makes a turn upon itself. The course it follows is shown by 
the letters e in the cut. (Home's Comp. Anat,, vol. i. p. 373.) 



Art. IV. A Notification of the Occurrence^ in the Island oj" Guern- 
sey^ of a Species of Testacellus, and of some of its Characteristics 
and Habits, as observed there. By Frederick C. Lukis, Esq. 

A SPECIES of Testacellus is rather abundant in certain lo- 
calities in this island (Guernsey); and I send drawings of it 
(7%. 39.) for comparison with the characteristics of T. scutu- 




!um Sowerhi/, as exhibited in the individuals of that species 
found, as stated in VI. 43. to 46., at Stamford Hill, Lambeth, 
Kensington, Bays water, and on the side of the road from 
London to Hampstead; and with the characteristics of T. 
Maugez, as figured in VI. 45. I avoid, purposely, applying 
a specific name to the species which occurs here, because I 
have never been able to ascertain, correctly, the distinctive 
differences of the few species which have been published ; 
namely, T. haliotideus \_Faure Biguef], scutulum Sowerbi/, 
Mauge/ Ferussac, and ambiguus Ferussac, with corneus and 
costatus of M. de Roissy. Besides, therefore, the identifica- 
tion of the species represented in my drawing, information 
on the differential characteristics of any of the species will be 
very acceptable. 

I had hoped that the late Mr. Miller of Bristol would have 
made some enquiries about the species which occurs here ; for 



which occurs in the Island of Guernsey. 



225 



a friend of his promised, several years ago, to inform him of 
Jts inhabiting this island. In 1827, a gentleman of the 
Island of Jersey kindly furnished me with a shell, said to have 
been found in the neighbourhood of Bristol : it bore, when 
sent to me, a label inscribed " Bulla haliotidea." On my 
examining this shell, I found it to be that of a Testacellus ; 
and, as I had not seen the T. haliotideus, which is a native of 
France and Spain, I imagined that some error had crept in, 
and that the specimen had been received from the Continent. 

As far back as 1801, the Testacellus which is represented 
in my drawing (Jig. 39.) was known to me, as it was then 
plentiful in my own garden ; since which period it has disap- 
peared from it ; but, at the end of the valley near which my 
garden is situate, the ground is plentifully supplied with indi- 
viduals of it. 

[^Characteristics and Habits."] The colour of the animal (a) 
is, generally, a sickly yellow spotted with brownish specks, 
mixed with pale orange along the lower parts. The figure, 
in VI. 45., of T. Mauge/ [repeated here (Jig. 40. c, d)] has 

the lateral furrow 
^^ ^ passing under the 

side of the caudal 
shell [erroneous- 
ly: see inp.229.]. 
In the animal 
here, the furrow, 
as is shown in my 
figure (39. b, c% 
commences near 
the top or ante- 
rior edge of the shell, by a double nearly united line, which 
diverges in a sort of erratic direction on both sides of the ani- 
mal, dividing the sides into unequal portions, until it terminates 
near the head. This line is better seen when the animal is 
extended, as are also the granulations or shagreen which are 
spread over the skin. It will be observed that I have shown 
six, instead of four, tentacula [our engraver has omitted the 
sixth]. The fact is, that the animal can, at its pleasure, 
expand and convert the corners of the lip into a subsidiary 
retractile pair, in place immediately beneath the anterior pair, 
to which they are equal in dimensions and similar in appear- 
ance. This fact may account for the difference of opinion 
which has obtained on the number of these organs. 

The eggs are perfectly oval, hard, and opaque ; when fresh, 
white and covered with a clear viscous juice; when older, 
they assume a deeper tinge, much like that of the egg of our 
Vol. VII. — No. 39. q 




226 Some of the Habits of 

game fowl, or that of the eggs of some fowls of the Bantam 
breed. They are not elastic, but have, like the eggs of the 
common fowl, a regular shell of lime, which effervesces 
strongly in acids. These eggs, if taken from the ground, 
and cleaned and brought into the warmer atmosphere of a 
room, will, in a few minutes, burst with a loud crack, and 
disperse their shell and contents to a considerable distance. 
Whilst I have been writing these remarks, one of the Testa- 
celli before me has, in the space of twenty minutes, laid two 
eggs {fg. 39. d), I sketch the animal as it presented itself 
while engaged in the operation, during which the head and 
tentacula were drawn in, to the degree shown in c. 

The mildness of the climate of Guernsey during the winter 
is, doubtless, the cause of the Testacellus being to be found at 
this period of the year. I should, however, state that those 
which I found in 1801 were, as in the cases remarked in VI. 
43. and 45., usually in the neighbourhood of a green-house. 

Guernsey^ Jan, 18. 1833. 



[Of Testacellus scutulum Sowerby, Mr.Thomas Blair, Stam- 
ford Hill (VI. 43.), obligingly sent me, on March 21. 1834, 
a supply of specimens ; nine living individuals, one dead 
one, and five eggs. These I carefully compared with the 
characteristics of the Guernsey Testacellus, as noted in Mr. 
Lukis's description, and shown in his admirable drawing. I 
could not perceive any mentionable difference between them, 
except that in the Stamford Hill animals the lateral furrow 
was less obvious, though still perceptible, than Mr. Lukis's 
drawing represents it to be in the Guernsey ones. I placed 
one of the eggs close beside the fire : it exploded, just as Mr. 
Lukis's had done. Most, or each, of the slugs themselves, 
exhibited, as it were, three pairs of tentacula, but I think that 
the pair produced by the protrusion of the corners of the lip 
were scarcely so long as the pair above them. 

On holding one or more of the slugs by the body, between 
my finger and thumb, I felt and saw my flesh struck with 
some white organ projected from the mouth of the slug. 
This, and a recollection of the worm-eating (vermivorous) 
habits of this species, instigated me to capture a smallish 
earthworm, and place it against the mouth of first one slug, 
then another. One endeavoured to take it, and its first 
act in the effort was darting out the organ I have mentioned, 
affixing it to the worm, and drawing the worm into its mouth. 
The worm, by its writhing, twisted itself out again, and this 
more than once, during the (about six) times which I, in the 



Testacellus scutulum Sowerby. 227 

course of about a quarter of an hour, excited the slug to pro- 
ject the peculiar organ noted. By observing this organ as 
accurately as I could during the slug's brief exposures of it, 
and by cutting open the one dead slug, I satisfied myself, in a 
good degree, that this organ is white, horny, of the figure of 
the longitudinal half of a hollow cone, with the hollow up- 
wards (so as to resemble a deep spoon), and that the slug, 
when informed of a worm's presence by the contact of its own 
head with a worm's body, projects this organ under the worm, 
to the flesh of which it adheres by a tenacious viscum, and 
perhaps, also, as the organ is hollow, by the aid of suction. 
It is projected and applied in an instant, and when applied, 
the action of a muscular structure, connected with its origin, 
draws it, and with it the worm, into the slug's mouth. The 
skin and parts of the head of the slug are then gradually 
turned in, as one would turn in the finger of a glove, or in 
the manner shown in Mr. Lukis's figure {Jig. 39. c), Mr. Blair 
informs us, in VI. 43., that the T. scutulum swallows worms 
(and occasionally a small slug) whole, and the introversive 
process mentioned (although the testacellus may not be able 
to employ introversively any very considerable portion of the 
upper part of its body) must avail it in swallowing worms 
which it happens to catch by either extremity. Mr. Blair has, 
however, seen (VI. 43.) " one firmly fixed to the middle of a 
large worm, the head of the slug being so buried in it that it 
appeared to be nearly cut in two." In the worm that had, as 
I have observed above, twisted itself out of the slug's mouth, 
I noticed, after it had twisted itself out, a piece of its flesh 
absent close beside the tip of the front extremity, and blood 
apparent there; and this, as I had not observed any defect in 
the worm when I applied it to the slug, I take to have been 
bitten out by the slug. This assumed fact, that quoted before 
it from Mr. Blair, and the likelihood that it is impracticable 
for the testacellus, whose body is somewhat slender, to swal- 
low a large worm doubled, suggest that, although this slug 
may usually swallow earthworms, &c., whole, it occasionally, 
also, partakes of the earthworms piecemeal. 

Mr. Blair thinks (VI. 44.) that the Testacellus usually gets 
hold of the worms underground. However this may be, the 
animal seems to insinuate its head and neck easily, and not 
very slowly, into loose broken soil ; and the slender attenuated 
form of the body, when extended, is not unfavourable to 
Mr. Blair's idea; and as the orifice, in the Testacellus, for the 
admission of air, is at the posterior extremity, just under 
the outward edge of the shell, protected, as it were, by the 
eaves of the shell, fancy may imagine the shell designed to 

Q 3

Characteristics and Habits of Testac^llm 



keep the orifice clear of soil, while the animal progresses 
through this pulverulent material. [I have since seen that 
M. de Ferussac has expressed, and more positively, both 
these ideas ; and Mr. G. B. Sowerby, also, that on the remark- 
able power of extension and attenuation of body given to the 
Testacelli. Fig. 41.6 shows their great power of contraction.] 

Mr. Blair's remarks, in VI. 43., intimate that the Testa- 
cellus does not hibernate ; Mr. Lukis's facts, above, teach 
the same thing; and a couple of facts known to me point to 
the same conclusion. The Testacelli (of the species T. scutu- 
lum, at least) seem to be, with regard to hybernation, in 
precisely the condition of the naked slugs, whose case has 
been so accurately described by G. J. in p. 116, 117. The 
fact told of a T. scutulum, in VI. 44., from Mr. J. Sowerby, 
jun.*; and that related above by Mr. Lukis, of a Testacellus 
laying its eggs after being twenty minutes in a warm room, 
suggest that the Testacelli are, indeed, especially sensitive of 
variations in temperature. 

Since the above remarks were written, we have striven to 
meet Mr. Lukis's wish for a statement of the diagnostics of 
the species of Testacellus. Mr. J. D. C. Sowerby has, in 
relation to this object, supplied the following figures (,y%.41.) ; 




J 8 h i 

and we have transcribed, with his permission, from his copy 
of Baron de Ferussac\s Histoire Naturelle Gen^rale et Parti- 
culiere des Mollusques Terrestres Fluviatiles, the diagnostics 
there given of T. haliotideus, Mauge/, and ambiguus; and 
from Mr. G. B. Sowerby's Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells, 
the one there given for T. scutulum, which is a species that

founded. Owr Jig. 40. c, (repeated in VI. 45., and VII. 225., from 
the Encyc. of Agriculture, ed. 2. ^ 7706.), is wholly erroneous, as com- 
pared with Ferussac's figures, in the matter of the part of the animal in 
which the lateral furrow is commenced. In Ferussac's figures, the 
furrow is represented as commenced in this species (T. Maugei) just in 
front of the shell, and as carried thence to each of the two sides of the 
animal's body. Fig. 40. fi? is a view of the shell of this species, taken

The body of this worm is from 4 in. to 6 in. long, con- 
tractile, semicylindrical, of the thickness of a large quill, and 
tapered towards the tail : it is of a brown colour, more or less 
deeply tinted with metallic green, particularly near the head 
and on the anterior margins or sides of the segments, and, in 
certain lights, is finely iridescent. A red vessel runs down 
the middle of the back, giving off to each foot a small branch, 
which is again slightly ramified; and a similar vessel may be 
traced along the flat ventral surface, which is marked with a 
central furrow, and stained in some degree with the opaque 
internal viscera. The head is square, with four small eyes ; 
two placed on each side at the base of a conical projection, on 

* We must just notice the following: — M. de Ferussac, in his " Ob- 
servations Generales sur 1' Organisation et les Facultes des Pulmones sans 
Opercule," in speaking of the means given to various animals of this class 
for defending themselves from the heating and drying effects of the solar 
rays, mentions a manteau particulier which is given to the Testacelli. This, 
in his generic character of the Testacelli, is thus described : — " Manteau : 
simple, gelatineux, contractile, cache habituellement sous le test, divise en 
plusieurs lobes susceptibles d'envelopper tout le corps par un developpe- 
ment extraordinaire, lorsque I'animal eprouve le besoin de se garantir de 
la secheresse." Mr. J. D. C. Sowerby has seen one or more animals enve- 
loped in this " manteau : " the body is then in its most contracted state. 
In the dead testacellus, of which we have spoken above, we perceived 
a starlike scar at a little distance from the front extremity of the body, 
which we avoided mentioning, for fear of being found in some error. On 
the organs of generation, however, Ferussac has remarked, " Reunis ; 
orifice en arriere du grand tentacule droit : '* and this remark, and the 
subsequent inspection of a preserved specimen at Mr. J. D. C. Sowerby's, 
assure us that the scar we had seen was this orifice.

which are articulated two longish papillae : and beneath these, 
and exterior to them, there are two much larger papillary 
processes, terminated with a small knob-like point, which is 
entirely retractile within the lower portion. On each side of 
the head, originating from a common swollen base, there are 
four setaceous tentacula of unequal lengths. The mouth is 
somewhat inferior, wide and terminal, furnished with a short 
thick proboscis, divided into two portions by a circular fold, 
and capable of being extruded at pleasure : its point is armed 
with two curved serrated horny mandibles ; and around these 
there are placed, on as many swellings, six distinct patches of 
small black horny prickles, the side patches larger than the 
others ; two still smaller patches, on mammillary swellings, are 
situated just under the projecting lobe of the head ; while, at 
the very base of the proboscis, we find a band of similar 
prickles, some larger than others, arranged in several irre- 
gular series. The whole surface of the proboscis is marked 
with pale longitudinal lines (muscles?), frequently anasto- 
mosing. The segment immediately behind the head is footless, 
and scored with faint whitish lines, or sometimes spotted ; and 
oblique lines of the same kind may be seen, with a magnifier, 
on the sides of the other segments. These are very numerous, 
shorter than their breadth, smooth, and furnished with papil- 
lary feet, filaments, and setae. The feet of the first two 
segments consist of only two fleshy papillae, but all the rest 
have three arranged transversely : the papillae are short, 
obtuse, and equal ; and, at the base of the superior one, as 
well as under the inferior one, there is a tentacular non- 
retractile filament; while a small brush of setae issues from the 
inner side, and near the root of each. These brushes are 
made up of a single strong black bristle and a considerable 
number of slender straight hairs, and can be pushed out or 
withdrawn at will. The tail is terminated with two short 
filaments.

232 Illustrations in British Zoologt/ : — 

Lyc6ri5 margaritacea is common in our bay, where it 
lurks under stones, between tide-marks. It is evidently car- 
nivorous ; and, between the mandibles of the specimen which 
served for our figure, a small Gammarus was found in a fatal 
grasp. Fresh water is an instant poison to it. 

I have been induced to select this worm for illustration in 
preference to many others, since it gives me an opportunity 
of correcting several errors which I have committed when 
describing the same species in the fourth volume of the 
Zoological Journal. It is there stated that I had not observed 
the proboscis to be divided into two joints, which, however, 
is the case ; and the patches of prickles round the base of the 
mandibles are described as being four instead of six in num- 
ber. I have there also constituted a species under the name 
of Lyc6ri5 viridis, which, a longer acquaintance with this 
family satisfies me, is merely a variety of the present, of a 
deeper and more uniform green than usual ; for the character 
on which I mainly rested the distinction between them 
(namely, the first segment being striated longitudinally in 
one, and spotted in the other) is, as I now find, one of no 
value. To acknowledge errors of this kind is a paramount 
duty *, although it may prove him who commits them to be 
one of little tact and experience.

and as it is now apparently discontinued, I may here be permitted to state 
that the Galba marina of Zool. Journ.^ vol. iii. p. 321., is the larva of a dip- 
terous fly, whose ova are frequently deposited and hatched amidst the 
roots of sea-weed that has been cast ashore ; as Mr. MacLeay proved, in an

after the publication of the error. 

Mr. MacLeay is of opinion that my Campontia eruciformis {Zool. Journ.,

Description, — Body oval ; pale brown, approaching to 
flesh-red, and, when alive, tinged with purple ; dotted all over 
with numerous punctures. Antennae, white, setaceous: the 
superior very short, with the two basilar joints much dilated, 
and forming a broad, movable, coloured plate before the eyes ; 
the third joint small and cylindrical ; the ultimate one, multi- 
articulate : inferior antenna? more than twice the length of the 
superior, the three basilar joints short, unequal ; the fourth, 
longer and cylindrical ; the ultimate longer than the whole, 
and multiarticulate : the bases of the antennae approximate, 
but do not meet ; and the superior just reach to the origin of 
the last joint of the inferior. Head small, almost entirely 
occupied by the large oblong eyes, which meet, and, as it 
were, coalesce in front : eyes reticulated, compound, dark 
brown, anterior and marginal, extending obliquely backwards, 
occupying all the cranial segment except a small point pro- 
jecting between the bases of the antennae, and a small tri- 
angular space behind. Underneath and between the inferior 
antennae there is an oblong concave small plate ; below which 



234- ^^g^ momphthdlma, 

the mouth is situated, armed with a pair of jaws, and fur- 
nished with two filiform palpi, one on each side, quadriar- 
ticulate ; the last joint unguiculate. Segments of the body 
seven, subequal, marked with a faint line across the middle, 
the margin pale; segments of the tail six, the first five 
narrow, equal, transverse ; the terminal one broad, oblong, 
roughish, depressed, with a strong keel down the centre, 
ending in a short point or mucro : the margins of these seg- 
ments are minutely spinous. On each side of the segments 
of the body there is a strong movable process, pointed pos- 
teriorly, and with two slight ridges down the middle : these 
processes or coxae cover and serve for the insertion of the 
legs, of which there are seven pairs. Legs white ; the first 
three pairs unlike the others, and directed forwards ; the 
thigh thick, elongate, with a circular curved head moving in 
an acetabulum; the tibia short, and smaller; the tarsus 
3-jointed, with a strong curved claw : thigh of the posterior 
pairs elongate, thickish ; the four succeeding joints much 
more slender, almost equal, spinous, and terminated with a 
curved claw. The legs are all punctured in the manner of 
the body ; but the ventral surface of the segments is smooth. 
Each caudal segment is furnished on each side with a pair of 
broad oval membranous plates, ciliated on the margins, and 
articulated, by twos, to a compressed stalk ; and there is, on 
each side of the last segment, an additional pair of foliaceous 
plates jointed to a movable, acutely-pointed, somewhat trian- 
gular process. Of these plates, the inner is wedge-shaped, 
the other oblong; and both are densely ciliated round the 
edge. 

This description is taken from the larger specimen figured 
(fl, dorsal aspect ; 6, ventral aspect) ; the smaller one {c) differs 
in having the two inferior joints of the superior antennae not 
disproportionately enlarged ; and the large segment of the 
tail is emarginate, truncate, with a shallow furrow down the 
centre, and two obtuse raised keels at its sides. In other 
respects, I perceive no difference. The figures are of the 
natural size. 

JE^g« monophthalma swims with rapidity by the aid of its 
caudal fins ; and, when it comes in contact with a solid body, 
it claps against it, and adheres tenaciously. Our specimens 
were taken adhering to large codfish, of which, it is pro- 
bable, they are the " pedicular " parasites ; but, unlike some 
of their race, they seem to be very rare, at least in our bay, 
for I could only procure three specimens ; and our fishermen 
had never observed them before. 



Structure and Economy of the Annulate Animals. 2S5 

I have described this as a new species, the more confidently 
that I have the authority of my friend Mr. J. E. Gray for 
doing so. In general form and size it resembles IKga emar- 
ginata ; but very obviously differs from that species by the 
remarkable proximity of the eyes, which, in the emarginata, 
are separated by a considerable interval. The smaller spe- 
cimen seems to possess the specific characters of the IKga 
bicarinata of Leach ; and I should mention that this specimen 
had not been seen by Mr. Gray when he gave me his opi- 
nion : but Dr. Leach would scarcely have left the peculiarity 
in the position of the eyes without some notice, had his species 
exhibited it. If I am right in deciding that it is of the same 
species as the larger individual, and probably the male of it 
(and, surely, the differences are not sufficient to warrant a 
belief that they are distinct species), then it would seem to 
follow, first, that the great dilatation of the basilar joints of 
the antennae is a sexual character, or one dependent on age, 
and of insufficient value, therefore, to be ranked among cha- 
racters which are seized upon to divide tribes or families 
from each other ; and, secondly, that the conformation of the 
extreme caudal segment is not sufficient to discriminate spe- 
cies, as Dr. Leach seems to have believed, for his specific 
characters embrace no other part.

There is nothing more unaccountable than the tenacity with 
which we cling to old opinions, simply because they are old ; 
nor than the pompous and solemn gravity with which we tell 
the most palpable and absurd untruths, simply becruse our 
forefathers told them. Wherefore can this be ? The pro- 
blem we will, however, leave, for solution, to the meta- 
physicians. One of these established fallacies has descended, 
with all its pomp, from the time of Aristotle to within a few 
years of the present day ; namely, that insects are without 
blood. When, however, the great discovery of the cir- 
culation of blood in the higher animals was made, insects 
were designated as being without a circulating blood. This 
distinction was considered perfect, until one or two enquiring 
minds, wishing to ascertain why this difference should exist, 
examined for themselves, and found it did not exist. 

The circulation of blood in annulates appears to have been 
generally doubted in this country, until Mr. Bowerbank, one 



236 Relations of the Structure of 

of our most successful microscopists, published, in the Ento- 
mological Magazine [vol. i. p. 239.]? a minute and most inter- 
esting account of it as observed by him in the larva of 
an Ephemera. Mr. Bowerbank's observations corresponded 
very closely with those of Professor Carus, a Continental 
naturalist, who had published his discoveries a short time 
previously, but whose descriptions Mr. Bowerbank had never 
perused. 

The circulation in annulates is not, as it is in vertebrates, 
entirely confined to limited and well-defined vessels ; neither 
is there any heart for the reception and expulsion of the 
blood ; but there is a large wide channel, extending the whole 
length of the animal, through which the blood is constantly 
rushing upwards from the posterior towards the anterior ex- 
tremity. This current is kept in motion by the alternate 
opening and closing of double valves, distributed at regular 
intervals throughout its extent : this operation causing a mo- 
tion, as each portion is afresh impelled upwards, which is 
precisely equivalent to the pulsations of a heart. The valves 
open upwards only, and between them, on both sides, are 
other valves in the great channel, which as regularly open 
inwards to admit fresh supplies of blood from the lateral 
portions of the body. On each side of the animal there is a 
downward current, confined to no distinct or ascertainable 
channel, but permeating indifferently all parts in the neigh- 
bourhood of its progress : portions, however, part off from 
the main current at intervals, and flow through the side 
valves of the central channel already described. The pulsa- 
tions in this downward current are more faint, and its pro- 
gress is somewhat more slow, than that in the upward central 
current. On the opening of a side valve, the blood may be 
seen rushing towards it from every part in the neighbourhood, 
as though it were in a state of freedom among the transparent 
and muscular parts, and not limited to any vessel. No blood 
ever leaves the main channel, but through the aperture at the 
anterior extremity, where it turns inwards towards the oeso- 
phagus, and cannot be traced, by the microscope, any farther. 
In the antennae, legs, and nervures of the wings a similar 
double current is observable. Such is the usual circulation 
of blood in an insect. 

In the lobster, and other large marine annulates, a some- 
what more perfect system is observable ; that is, the limits 
of all the vessels are perfectly well defined, and may be 
ascertained and figured with confidence and even ease. In 
these, there is a manifest approach to the circulation of 
fishes, which possess it in the most simple state of all the 



Aiinulate Animals to their Economy, 237 

vertebrates. The marine annulates farther resemble fishes 
in breathing by gills ; a most beautiful and wonderful con- 
trivance, which enables them to extract from water a suf- 
ficient quantity of air to aerate the blood, and thus pre- 
cludes the necessity, so obviously attendant on all other 
modes of respiration, namely, a constantly repeated ascent to 
the surface for fresh supplies of atmospheric air. In these 
animals, consequendy, the blood must ascend to the gills, in 
order to be brought into contact with the air so produced ; 
but in the hexapod or true insects, which constitute by far 
the greater portion of the annulate kingdom, the respiration 
and aeration of the blood are managed on an entirely different 
principle. 

The circulation of blood in hexapod insects we have 
already examined ; let us now turn to the circulation of air. 
This is not confined to a single region, as the gills in fishes, 
or the lungs in man ; but seems to be almost universal : it 
consists of an infinity of tubes ramifying through the body in 
every direction, from one end to the other. These air-tubes, 
termed tracheae, have generally nine nearly equidistant ex- 
ternal openings, termed spiracula, on each side of an insect. 
From each spiraculum a main trachea seems to enter the 
body, and immediately divides into two, three, four, or five 
minor tubes, one of which usually unites with the next spira- 
culum ; thus forming a principal trachea, which extends the 
whole length of the body, on each side of the great dorsal 
channel for the blood already spoken of. From the main 
spiracular tracheae minor transverse tracheae frequently arise, 
and, passing above and below the great dorsal channel, unite 
with similar minor tracheae, twigging off from the opposite 
side ; and thus the whole system of tubes becomes connected, 
and acts by a common impulse. 

To a casual observer, it may seem, perhaps, somewhat 
strange that a system of respiratory organs so apparently 
complicated should have been given to a race of beings which 
we consider of so very little importance in the universe : but 
an examination, however cursory, will show that here, as in 
every other of the Almighty's works, there is nothing super- 
fluous ; that there has been no labour in vain. 

Respiration and circulation are so intimately connected, 
that the operation of each depends on the operation of the 
other. Now, in insects the blood is cold ; and for this excel- 
lent reason, that, in so small a bulk as that of an insect's body, 
so large a portion of the blood is exposed to the air, that a 
heat superior to that of the atmosphere could not be main- 
tained. This being the case, circulation of the simplest pos- 



238 Structure and Economy of the Afinulate Animals, 

sible kind was all that was required, and is all that has 
been given. It is well known that the blood of animals, when 
deprived of all communion with atmospheric air, stays in its 
course, and ceases to perform its functions. Now, by the 
simple system of circulation above described, it is evident that 
the blood could not be brought, with any regularity, to one 
particular spot, there to communicate with and receive air 
sufficient to renew and maintain its vital power. It becomes, 
therefore, a matter of necessity, that, as the blood does not 
go to the air to receive revivification, the air must be intro- 
duced to the blood for effecting that purpose. The most 
simple, the most direct, way of accomplishing this was by 
piercing the sides of the animal at regular intervals through- 
out its length, and inserting tubes through which the atmo- 
spheric air should pass with perfect freedom into the system, 
and mingle with the blood in any quantity that nature might 
demand. This is the very plan that we find has been adopted. 

To this, the breathing of the marine annulates, already 
noticed, may be cited as an exception ; it may be said that 
their blood is cold, and yet they breathe by gills. This is 
true ; but it is also true that their residence in the depths of 
the ocean precludes the possibility of their using spiracula ; 
we therefore find the system of their circulation raised, to 
cooperate with their improved respiration. It was quite 
needless that their blood should, farther, be warmed ; for we 
find that even in fishes the blood is perfectly cold, for the 
same reason as in insects, because their bodies are (when 
young) too small to resist the temperature of the surrounding 
medium. 

There are numerous aquatic annulates which belong to the 
hexapod or true insects, which are provided with a system of 
respiratory organs precisely similar to that of the terrestrial 
insects ; these have the power of enveloping, with a bladder 
of atmospheric air, those parts of the body in which their 
spiracles are situated ; thus not only protecting the spiracles 
from receiving any injury from the ingress of the water, but 
keeping up the necessary supply of air to the blood. The 
bladder of air is renewable at pleasure by rising to the sur- 
face, * 

(To be continued.) 

* Do not the sacs, within which trachean y!frachnides have been found pa- 
rasitic upon the aquatic i)ytlscus marginalis (see p. 161.) serve the same 
purpose as this " bladder of atmospheric air" serves to the aquatic hexapod 
insects ? and, farther, all the cysts, with which a variety of animals pa- 
rasitic upon aquatic animals are found covered ? See VI. 94., for a notice 
of some parasites found encysted. — J. D.

The table beneath shows the quantity of rain which has 
fallen in this place, in the months November, December, 
and January, during the last ten winters. It may serve to 
correct the general impression, that more rain fell during last 
winter, than had fallen in any winter of several preceding years.

From this table it appears, that, in the winter embracing 
1827-28, rain fell to the amount of 1 1*435 in.; while, in the 
winter which is just closed, only 10*925 in. of rain have 
fallen : giving an excess of upwards of half an inch to the 
former period. The great difference has been, that rain has 
fallen more frequently in the last winter (namely, on 63 days) ; 
while, in that of 1827-28, rain fell only on 55 days: and to 
this circumstance may be attributed the prevalent opinion. 

That great humidity of atmosphere is constantly attended 
by a high degree of temperature, is well known to every 
meteorologist; but the mildness of the last three months, 
or brumal quarter, was most extraordinary. In the brumal 
quarter of 1827-28, the mean temperature was 40*10819°, 
which was very much above the average ; and the extremes 
were 56^ and 15*50°. In the recent one, the extremes were 
58° and 24° ; and the mean 41*87835° : the extremes occurred 
in November in both instances. Out of 92 days comprising 
the quarter lately expired, the wind blew from the westward 
on 72 days ; but, in the brumal quarter of 1827-28, only on 60. 

It is curious to observe, that the greatest quantity of rain 
fell when the extreme of cold was experienced in the month 
of November ; and it is only by the record of observations 
like these, that the meteorologist can hope to promote a science 
(of the greatest importance to mankind) as yet in its infancy ; 
and possessing but few of the charms which captivate and 
allure the student in other sciences, cheer him in his course, 
and reward his toils.

The Fox and the Dog have been known to feed upon Fish, — 
That foxes feed on fish is, I believe, a fact hitherto unknown 
to naturalists ; at least, speaking for myself, during a life of 
many years devoted to the study of natural history, I have 
never heard of it. That it was not impossible, however, I 
should never have doubted, from a curious corroboration of 
its possibility, which happened more than once under my own 
observation. I occasionally took out with me in a boat, when 
fishing, a small terrier of the Scotch breed. One day, having 
caught three or four dace, after some minutes I turned round 
to examine them, when, lo ! they had disappeared ; and I 
could in no way discover the cause. Shortly I caught another, 
and threw it down, when, to my great surprise, the dog quietly 
took it up, and (after very composedly craunching its bones) 
swallowed it with apparent satisfaction, and then looked up 
with a hungry eye, as if to request a farther supply. As far 
as I can recollect, the dog ate about half a dozen before any 
symptoms of " hold, enough, " were manifested. 

Now for the fox ; whose case, though it depends upon cir- 
cumstantial rather than positive evidence, I have no hesitation 
in believing to be perfectly true. In the course of last 
autumn, I believe, in October or November, a gentleman's 
keeper in my parish, in passing a pond very early, after a 
moonlight night, found upon the bank the remains of a pike 
which had weighed about 5 lbs. The flesh was consumed, 
with the exception of what adhered to the head and tail. 
The fish he was well acquainted with, having often noticed it 
before, and during the preceding summer had as often, in vain, 
endeavoured to take it by night lines, &c. Of course, his 
first thought was, " how got it there, so strangely out of its 
element?" A poacher would certainly not have left it. Fishing 
eagles had never been seen or heard of in this part of the 
country ; and otters had long been an extinct race in the 
neighbourhood. But, on closely examining the mud and soil, 
he soon discovered a clue to solve the mystery ; the adjacent 
parts being padded with footmarks, which his long and prac- 
tical experience convinced him were those of a fox. It is 
probable, too, that, like himself, the fox had long had an eye 
to this well-fed pike, as it then occurred to him, that he had 
often before seen similar footmarks about the pit side banks. 
To have witnessed the capture would have been an interesting 
scene indeed. It is most likely that the wily animal, on ex- 
amining the water, discovered the pike near the surface, 
prowling about for food, and, availing himself of its approach- 



Mammiferoiis /hiimals, Birds, 24*1 

ing within reach, pounced upon his prey, and succeeded in 
grasping it with his teeth ; this, however, he could not have 
done without considerable tact and difficulty, as the floundering 
resistance of a five-pounds'-weight pike must have lasted some 
time, and been very powerful. — E. S., F,L.S. [For notes 
on other habits of the fox, see p. 134.] 

Birds. — T/ie smnlldark hroison Thrush 7iotifiedbyW.L.(p. 14:4'.^ 
and previously) ; *uoith some Remarks on the British Thrushes, — 
*' It is much to be wished," as the Rev.W.T. Bree has observed 
(p. 75.), " that W, L. had procured a specimen of his thrush, 
in order to put the point beyond dispute;" for, until this is 
done, it seems somewhat premature to pronounce it a distinct 
species. The common song thrush varies in size very con- 
siderably, and in the number of black spots upon the breast. 
Of two males now before me, both in tolerably good condition, 
one weighs 2J oz., and the other but 2 oz. The former of 
these has remarkably few black spots on the under parts ; 
whereas, some that I have seen have been so thickly studded 
that the ear-coverts have appeared wholly black. Lewin and 
others have even described, as a distinct species, what they 
call " the heath thrush ; " which now is, I believe, universally 
admitted to be merely a small variety of the TYu'dus musicus. 
I must be pardoned, therefore, for still entertaining doubts as 
to W. L.'s thrush being an undescribed species ; first, because 
I know that the common song thrush (to which it seems so 
closely to approximate) varies in size very much ; secondly, 
because the song thrush may often be observed upon the 
wildest heaths, and, in such situations, is generally small; 
and, thirdly, because so common a bird as that of W. L. 
appears to be, if really distinct, could not well have escaped 
the ken of the many experienced practical naturalists who 
have visited the parts it inhabits, seemingly so plentifully. 
However, I hope that W. L. will soon succeed in obtaining 
some specimens of his thrush, that he will actually compare 
it with the song thrush, and favour Mr. Loudon's readers with 
a minute description of its characters, that the matter may at 
once be satisfactorily set at rest, without farther cavil. 

That the first notice of it (VI. 218.) referred merely to the 
redwing, was the opinion of many persons besides myself (VI. 
516.), and was strengthened by the fact of no allusion having 
been made to this species ; although its manners, as observed 
in the south of England, were pretty accurately portrayed : 
and which bird it further seemed to resemble in size. The 
redwing, it may be remarked, resembles much more the song 
thrush, in colour and general appearance, than it does the

fieldfare (as stated In VII. 144.); and it would be often mistaken 
for the song thrush (which sometimes associates in flocks), and 
vice versa, were it not for its frequently repeated alarm cry 
(resembling powk)^ and the characteristic large pale streak 
over the eye, similar to that — not of the stonechat, as stated 
at p. 145., but — of the whinchat. 

In reply to Mr. Salmon (p. 175.), I can state, upon good 
authority, that both the redwing and the fieldfare have been 
repeatedly seen, throughout the summer, in a wood called the 
Wood of Logie, upon the estate of Sir John Forbes, at Fin- 
try, in Aberdeenshire ; but I am sorry, still, to be unable to 
furnish any description of their nidification. My informant, 
an experienced observer, is quite positive with regard to the 
species; but has never searched for their nests, not being 
aware, at the time, that they were so little known. He 
has heard the fieldfare sing, and as described by Dr. 
Booker, (p. 151.) I may remark here, in corroboration of 
Mr. Salmon's observation (p. 175.), that a flock of about forty 
missel thrushes, which frequented this neighbourhood about 
the latter end of last August, were very generally mistaken 
for fieldfares : although the great difference in their notes 
rendered them easily distinguishable. That these were about 
to migrate, I have hardly a doubt ; though a few solitary 
missel thrushes have been singing about this place all the 
winter. 

The flocks of redwings and fieldfares in these parts some- 
times associate, and, occasionally, a few song thrushes may 
be observed among them; but they more frequently keep 
separate, the fieldfares remaining mostly in small parties of 
five or six (probably families) ; three or four of which some- 
times unite, but often separate again : in this, as in other 
respects, closely resembling the missel thrush, which, in win- 
ter, is generally seen in small flocks of five or six. The field- 
fare farther resembles the missel thrush, in feeding more upon 
berries than the redwing and mavis ; which latter birds, espe- 
cially the mavis, appear to prefer snails to any other kind of 
food ; knocking off their shells in a very expert manner, and 
gulping them down whole. The blackbird is very partial to 
snails ; but neither it nor the missel thrush (which latter is, 
however, rather indifferent to them) understand how to shell 
them like the redwing and song thrush ; but (at least in con- 
finement, if the shell is not broken beforehand) generally 
make a sad bungle, besmearing themselves all over with slime. 
Instead of commencing operations by knocking off the shell, 
they try to pull the snail out of it ; which, of course, they find 



Birds. 243 

to be a very awkward matter. A song thrush will devour 
five or six snails before a blackbird can swallow one.* 

Though the fieldfare remains plentiful here until late in 
April, I do not think it ever sings in these parts. Its usual 
note, sue, sue, s?ic, is all that I have ever heard from this 
species ; and though a little singing may appear sometimes to 

* [ We looked out, and saw a thrush, with its beak thrust into 

a snail shell, standing by a garden pot, which was sunk in the ground to its 
rim. The bird had ceased for a minute from its labour; and now again 
began ivhacking the unhappy snail against the liower-pot, in order to break 
the shell; which, with the greater portion of its inhabitant, hung dangling 
from his beak. The exertions of the thrush were surprising ; his whole 
body shook with the vigour with which he carried on the assault and bat- 
tery ; and it soon enabled him to draw forth another shred of the snail : 
this he ate, and again returned to the attack, beating it for at least a dozen 
times, when more of the mangled wretch was dragged out, and despatched. 
The next essay of the bird did not appear to please him ; for he left the 
garden pot, and carried his prey to a sharp stone, against which he recom- 
menced beating it. The stone was, perhaps, loose, and did not afford the 
required resistance : instinct, therefore, (was it not reason ?) induced hira 
to return to his first resisting medium. Again, then, were we amused by 
the sagacity of the bird ; and our sympathies excited by the sufferings of 
the lacerated snail, which was thus drawn out bit by bit, and ultimately 
devoured. — Campanella. Berkshire. Received Jan. 9. 1834. — All the spe- 
cies of Turdus, or thrush, the blackbird (T*. Merula) included, collectively 
destroy a great quantity (Mr. Blyth has, above, stated which of the species 
destroys the most) of the shelled snails. The periods m which they most 
destroy them are, I think, during the frosts of winter, and through July 
and August. In winter, after a night or two sharply frosty, with just a 
sprinkling of snow on the ground, it is pleasing to stroll beside hedge- 
rows, and see the Turdi starting in and out, on the face of the hedge* 
banks, and between the base of the stems of the hedges, in search of 
the snails. If you proceed slowly, a smart reiterated tapping, not loud, 
but obvious, is heard at uncertain intervals, as the Turdi may find their 
prey. This they break, not wherever found, but on some stone fixed firmly 
with one face exposed in the bank's side, and, I think, station themselves 
below the stone : I have, in my own vocabulary, called such stones, chosen 
of the thrushes, the thrushes' chopping-blocks. These birds, through July 
and August, explore hedgerows, orchards, and gardens with great diligence 
for snails, and kill vast numbers of them. The hard texture, at this season, 
of paths and roadways, makes these sufficient chopping-blocks for the birds, 
whose havoc is shown by the many empty shells then met with in every 
path ; for they at this time do not usually break the shell into pieces, but 
peck a hole through the last and larger coil. I have, to myself, sought to ac- 
count for the Turdi consuming more snails in July and August than at other 
times. Their doing it in frosty weather is clearly from necessity ; but in 
July and August this cause might seem not to obtain. I have, however, 
thought it does. The face of the earth is then invested with crops of herb- 
age, which, I have conceived, lessen rather than enlarge these birds' scone 
of forage ; while, of fruits, the gooseberry and the cherry are past, and the 
autumnal fruits not ripe. The Turdi will, when need prompts, eat the 
earthworm, when they meet with it (in part) exposed within their range.

other molluscous animals, see in II. 151.; III. 193. ; 238., and note f in

proceed from a flock of tliem, it may generally be traced to* 
a few acconipanying redwings. The thrushes generally, I 
think, form rather an exception to the Rev. W. T. Bree's 
observation (p. 75.), of birds acquiring, each season, their full 
song by degrees. Most of the smaller kinds certainly do 
acquire their song gradually ; but the missel thrush and the 
mavis sing as loudly and clearly in November as in March ; 
and the deep-toned voice of the blackbird is as rich and as 
full when he first bursts forth into melody, in early spring, as 
in April, when the practice of many weeks should have 
matured his vocal powers. From analogy with these, there- 
fore, I am inclined to question whether the redwing's voice 
improves from the time it first begins to sing; for it is the 
same in May as in January. A day or two ago, I think, I 
heard one in its full perfection ; it did not see me ; and was 
alone, away from its companions, and piping forth with the 
utmost glee and spirit. Its notes were low and soft, some of 
them very sweet ; and it now and then introduced a few that 
were loud and pleasing r but, altogether, its song by no means 
equalled that of the mavis. The redwing, in short, is not a 
bird worth confining for the mere sake of its music. —

The Booh (148.) — Will the idea (In 243. note *), that the 
soil's being covered up, in summer and autumn, with ground 
crops, prevents access to it for ground grubs and insects, 
account for the rook's then feeding on grain, nuts, fruits, &c. 
(whence the epithet frugilegus has been applied to it)? Some 
will rather refer the latter habit of rooks to their sympathy 
in the sentiment, " nos numerus sumus, et fruges consumere 
nati ; " and I, for one, think that the rooks do quite rightly 
in acting on it. Mr. Saul of Lancaster has just informed Mr, 
Loudon that the Rev. Mr. Ridley had found that the husk of 
grain taken by the rook is separated, in the rook's stomach, 
from the grain itself, and is afterwards discharged from the 
mouth of the rook in masses of the size of a pigeon's eg^» 
Mr. Saul has sent a specimen. The husks appear those of 
oats. — J, D. 

A Second Brood of Waterhens adopted and catered for by the 
Individuals of the First Brood, [From a letter to the Rev. 
W.T. Bree, by J. M. Boultbee, Esq. ; dated Kineton, Aug. 20. 
1833.] — At the bottom of the walk between the house and 



Birds, 245 

our garden in winter runs a brook, but in summer there Is 
only still water, which is inhabited by waterhens, &c. The 
waterhens have become quite tame, from persons constantly 
passing and repassing. This year, in the spring, a pair of them 
hatched some young ones ; and, as soon as they were feathered, 
made another nest, and hatched some more. The young 
ones of the second hatch left the old birds, and have been 
adopted by the young ones of the first hatch, who have each 
taken one, and seem to take as much care of them as the old 
ones could have done : they feed them, and never leave them. 
Only one young one has remained witli the old hen. — J. M, B. 

[Facts on other points in the history of the waterhen may 
be found in IV. 517. 519., V. 381. 601. 750., VII. 73.; and 
in the Field Naturalist, i. 499.] 

A Male Redstart has aided in sustaining and pi'otecting the 
Offspring of another Pair of Redstarts. — I discovered the nest 
of a pair of redstarts (Sylvia Phcenicurus), called here fire-tails, 
in a hole in a wall in my garden, from the male bird's constantly 
sitting on a particular tree near the place where the nest was, 
and from his continually uttering his plaintive and garrulous 
note while any object to excite alarm was in sight. I mention 
this, because, from his attention to his mate, I was particularly 
interested in the pair, and watched them with great care. In 
about two or three days after I had discovered them (the hen 
was then sitting), the male bird, while on his usual station, 
was, to my great grief, killed by a stone which his familiarity 
had tempted an idle boy to throw, I saw him killed myself. 
On my going by the place the next day, I was excessively 
surprised to see a male redstart sitting on the very same tree 
from which, the day before, the other had been knocked 
down. On my going near the nest, it flew away with evident 
tokens of alarm ; and on my putting my hand to the nest, the 
hen bird flew off'. All I need say in addition is, that the eggs 
were hatched, and the foster-fother (for such he certainly was) 
assisted, as the cock birds usually do, the hen in bringing up 
the young brood. The circumstance has puzzled me extremely, 
both then and since. How could the redstart be possibly 
acquainted that the hen was without a male ? She could not 
have been off* the nest long ; for, if the eggs had once got cold, 
they could never have been hatched ; and the redstart is a 
solitary bird, and by no means common here. — Subnistiais. 

The Origin of the Songs of Birds. — A person known to 
me put some goldfinches' eggs under a canary ; and although 
the young goldfinches hatched by the canary from these eggs 
learned the song of the canary, yet ihey by no means lost 
their own innate note : their song was, consequently, a niix-

Saurian? Reptiles. — Recent Appearance of the Great 
American Sea Serpent. — In the last edition of my Introduction 
to Geology^ chap. xvi. p. 312., 1 stated an opinion that the 
great sea serpent, which had been frequently seen near the 
coast in the United States of America, might probably belong 
to some species of saurian animal of a genus analogous to the 
fossil ichthyosaurus ; and that the description of it as having 
paddles like those of a turtle, and immense jaws like those of 
the crocodile, agreed rather with that of a saurian animal than 
a serpent. The body was said, by some who had seen it, to 
be of great length, and equal in bulk to a large water cask. 
In a note to the American reprint, just published, of that 
edition of my Introduction to Geology, Professor Silliman states 
that " Dr. Jacob Baglew of Boston has published a collec- 
tion of documents on the subject of the sea serpent, which 
presents a mass of evidence sufficient to establish any fact that 
can be established by human testimony. See his account in 
the American Journal of Science, vol. ii. p. 147 — 164. Almost 
every year since has added to the amount of evidence; and 
the present year, 1833, has been particularly fruitfid in such 
testimony^ He adds, " Attempts to capture or kill these 
extraordinary animals have proved hitheito abortive ; but, in 
some more fortunate conjuncture, our eastern seamen, pro- 
verbial for their intrepidity and dexterity in hunting the 
whale, *will yet bring in the sea serpent or animal, whatever it 
may be, that has borne that name. Mr. BakewelPs ingenious 
conjecture, that it may be a saurian, agrees, however, much 
better with the supposition that it is a plesiosaurus than an 
ichthyosaurus, as the short neck of the latter does not cor- 
respond with the ordinary appearance of the sea serpent. — 
B. Silliman." Believing that this farther confirmation of the 
present existence of the sea serpent may be interesting, I 
communicate it. — R. Bakewell. Hampstead, April, 1834.

— Kirby and Spence, in their Litr., vol. ii. p. 446., and Pro- 
fessor Ilennie, in Insect Transformations, p. 95., speaks of 
the little effect produced on the eggs of insects by intense 
cold; and the winter of 1829 afforded full evidence of the 
fact. During the night of the 2d of February, 1830, the 
index of my self- registering thermometer fell to 1 8° Reaumur, 
or 8 J° below zero of Fahr. ; at eight o'clock in the morning

of the 3d it was still 16° Reaum., or 4° Fahr. ; and at the 
same hour several thermometers in the neighbourhood of 
Berne marked 24° Reaum., or 22° Fahr. The succeeding 
summer was as productive as usual of insects ; not only of 
those which are hatched from the egg, but also of those which 
hibernate in the pupa state. I have, however, remarked a 
singular fact, namely, that, during the year 1832, a sharp 
look-out only enabled me to find one, and that a feeble 
individual, of Melolontha vulgaris, usually very abundant, 
and having a marked inclination for a particular plum tree in 
my orchard ; a vigilant search failed to procure me a single 
Zucanus Cervus. A neighbour and myself, aided by a troop 
of young foragers, were not able to obtain more than seven 
full-grown larvae of Cossus ligniperda ; and Cetonia aurata, 
and some other species which pass three years in the larva 
state, were, although not quite so deficient as the Melolontha 
vulgaris, the Z^ucanus Cervus, and the Cossus ligniperda, deci- 
dedly far less numerous than usual. Are we to conclude from 
this, that, although intense cold fails to destroy the eggs, full- 
grown larvae, or pupae, it is fatal to the young larvae of such 
species as pass three winters in their first state of existence ? 

I should be glad to know whether this circumstance has 
been noticed elsewhere : but the observations, to be conclusive, 
must have been made in a district which was exposed during 
some time to a temperature not higher than zero of Fahr., as 
our experience of our ordinary winters proves that a degree 
of cold occasionally only equal to zero is but little fatal to 
the insect world. On the 25th of February, 1830, Fahrenheit's 
thermometer being at 60°, Vaness<2 urticae and Gonepteryx 
rhamni were on the wing ; having, I presume, safely passed 
the winter term in the pupa state. Writers on entomology 
generally speak of these early visiters as un impregnated fe- 
males, which, having issued from the chrysalis in autumn, after 
the disappearance of the males, have lived through the win- 
ter in the perfect state ; and the circumstance is adduced as a 
wonderful instance of an extraordinary prolongation of life, 
granted, by an omnipotent and beneficent Providence, to indi- 
viduals produced at a season when the purpose for which 
that life was bestowed could not be accomplished in its ac- 
customed period. I by no means call in question the cor- 
rectness of tliis opinion in its general application^ not having 
particularly noticed the subject, except during the last few 
years ; and I consider that observations made in one place, or 
in one climate, are insufiicient either to establish or refute a 
general fact. In most parts of Switzerland the rule certainly 
does not apply : and I would caution young entomologists

not to assume as a matter of course, and without examination, 
that the first butterflies they see in spring have hibernated 
in the perfect state. Here, notwithstanding the rigour of 
our winters, a sudden elevation of temperature usually brings 
out Vanessa urticae and Gonepteryx rharani from the 10th 
to the 15th of February, which seems to be much earlier than 
their customary first appearance in England. During some 
years I have invariably noticed the first of both the above 
species on the same day; and on the 31th of February last 
[1833], after a week of warm weather, the thermometer being 
at 51°, many dozens of each kind were on the wing: I was 
struck with the freshness of their colours, and as V. urticae 
will allow you to approach pretty close while it is fanning 
its wings as it basks in the sunshine on some rounded 
pebble, I marked down several, and satisfied myself that they 
were as bright and unsullied as when reared in the breeding 
cage; none appeared torn, or in any way injured. Their in- 
dependent manner of flight, and bearing towards each other, 
seemed to indicate that there w^as no admixture of the two 
sexes, and I should imagine, from their appearance, that they 
were mostly or entirely males, but, not being prepared with a 
net, I was not able to capture any for close inspection. With 
respect to Gonepteryx rhamni there can be no difficulty ; the 
difference of colour in the two sexes being so great that a 
male must be most wofully weatherbeaten to be mistaken at 
any distance for a female. In our neighbourhood is a place 
which swarms with this species, and in summer the females 
greatly exceed the males, probably from their congregating 
for the purpose of laying their eggs. I frequently visit this 
spot in the early spring; and can safely assert that neither 
there, nor on the sunny slopes at the edges of our forests, 
have I ever seen a single female among many hundreds of 
males which have been on the wing as early as February. 
I have caught numbers expressly to examine their condition ; 
and, having always found them peculiarly bright and perfect, 
I am compelled to draw the conclusion that, in this climate 
at least, the early flight of Gonepteryx rhamni consists en- 
tirely of newly excluded males, and that probably the same 
is the case with Vanessa urticae. Usually after a fortnight or 
three weeks of almost summer weather in February, a blus- 
tering north-easter brings a return of sleet, snow, and frost in 
March, and it has always been after these have passed that 
I have seen the first female butterflies. The first female Go- 
nepteryx I have seen this year was a solitary individual, on 
the 29th of March. 

Two circumstances occurred this year confirmatory of the 
above opinion. On the evening of the 10th of February

a stranger tapped at my window for admittance, which was 
instantly granted : he proved to be a male Amphidasis pilo- 
saria Fr. whose perfect condition left no doubt of his having 
burst from his chrysalis since the morning. It is true his near 
affinity to Hibernia and other brumal phalaenas might induce 
us to look for him in cold weather ; but Duponchel assigns 
March and April for the period of his appearance in the 
climate of Paris, certainly not earlier than Gonepteryx and 
Vanessa are admitted to quit their pupae. The second case 
was the exclusion of a male Vanessa To on the 23d February, 
from a chrysalis which had undergone its transformation in a 
loft on my premises, and which had been left completely un- 
disturbed and untouched, to proceed in its regular course. 

In Vol. III. p. 243., Mr. Bree speaks of the 18th March as 
the earliest date at which he ever knew a Papilio issue from 
the chrysalis, [for dates of early appearances, though not from 
the chrysalis, see V. 595., VI. 88. 176.]; and I attribute their 
precocity in Switzerland to the increased excitability which 
seems to be the common result of severe and long-continued 
cold, occasioning the almost magic transition from " thick- 
ribbed ice" to verdure and flowers, which is represented to 
take place in Lapland, Russia, and America. Every writer 
on Switzerland has noticed 

The Proximity of the Alpine Flowers to the eternal Snows a?id 
Glaciers ; and as the snow next to the ground most usually 
melts the first, at least when the bed is of considerable thick- 
ness, it is not rare to see some of the hardiest and earliest 
blowing plants in full bloom, under a projecting canopy of 
frozen snow which constantly drenches them with an icy 
shower. The most beautiful effect I remember to have seen, 
was upon the Faulhorn, in the month of July, 1824-. Between 
the spot where visiters who ascend on horseback quit their 
saddles, and the foot of the highest slope, was a bed of snow 
of about a quarter of an acre, quite hard, but not more than 
half a foot thick; a few days before my visit, a horse had 
crossed this bed, and on each spot where he had stepped, the 
snow had disappeared, leaving a succession of circles about 
6 in. in diameter, which were literally filled with flowers of 
all hues, but scarcely one reaching to the level of the surface 
of the surrounding snow. — J, P. Brown, Thun^ Switzerland, 
April 5. 1833. 

Had not some of these been in flower actually under, and 
while covered by, the snow ? Mr. Dennis, nurseryman, 
Chelsea, has found that the species of Primula, of Cyclamen, 
of Orchidea3, of Pelargonium of the Ciconium or horse-shoe 
group, and a yellow-coroUaed Pinguicula from the United

States, produce their corollas, and those of, or nearly of, the 
colours respectively proper to each species, in an obscured 
condition of light almost equal in obscurity to that of a cover- 
ing of snow. It is notable that the flowers and herbage of 
each of the plants indicated above turn black in the course of 
being dried for specimens. — J. D. 

The Vitality of the Eggs of some Species of Insect is ve7y 
persistent. — Some years since, I had in my bedroom a glazed 
case containing two stuffed blackbirds. To my knowledge, it 
had been in the house twenty-three years, and at least half 
that time in my room. I often used to examine the case, as 
thinking it curious that the birds should remain so long in a 
state so perfect as that they were in. One morning, as I was 
rising, I was much surprised to see the case full of innumer- 
able small winged insects, all come to life, as it were, at the 
same moment. I again examined the case, and nothing 
seemed to indicate the least decay in any one part of it. The 
thought that the vitality of these eggs had remained so long 
preserved is an almost incredible one. The whole plumage 
of the two birds fell off at the time of the appearance of the 
insects. — i/. B. Blois, Nov. 16. 1833.

merely to observe that I can 
hardly think the glowworm 
has ever been found in the

found it there. This I know,

of them afterwards. I conclude, therefore, that the climate, 
or soil, or both, did not agree with them, and that they 
perished. I may just add that I have seen the glowworm in 
great splendour at Redbrook, near Monmouth, on the banks of 
t,he Wye. — James Jenjiings. 14. Goswell Road, Nov. 12. 1832.

miles from the town, and just within which distance the fens 
of the county may be said to begin, I have never seen a 
Zampyris noctiluca, or heard of one's being seen. " The 
glowworm" of these parts is the ^Scolopendra electrica, which 
is by no means rare there. I have, however, been told that 
the /^ampyris does occur at Cherryhinton, a village in which 
chalk abounds, situate three miles south by east of Cambridge. 
In Suffolk, a county in which land in general is high and dry, 
and chalk comparatively abundant, the Xampyris is not unfre- 
quently met with. It occurs in the villages of Whepstead, 
Horningsheath (pronounced Horringer), Hawstead, and Now- 
ton, all near Bury St. Edmunds. The Rev. H. Hasted, of 
this town, once remarked to me, that, on travelling by coach 
at night, he observed, a little past Newark, clusters of the 
JLampyris beside the road ; and he also expressed to me his 
opinion that it is an insect confined to, or at least most pre- 
valent on, chalky soils. — J. D. 

The Glowworm is plentiful in many Parts of the Kingdom, 
— They affect damp woods and hedgerows. The females 
exhibit their light most in showery weather, and are by no 
means a pleasant spark to the farmer, whose hay is lying on 
the field. They are seen most frequently from midsummer 
to the end of August. Their light is " the torch of Hymen;" 
for the winged males fly to any other luminous body ; to the 
lantern of the benighted traveller ; or to a lighted candle, 
if a window happens to be open, as is often the case in 
warm summer evenings. I have caught half a dozen at a 
time of these " gay Lotharios " from off the supper table, 
and turned them adrift to seek their " flames " farther afield. 
The males have lamps also, but very faint even in the dark : 
of course they are invisible during their flight in the open 
air [Albert seems of a different opinion, see V. 764.]. When 
the nymph is in full glory, she has the power of dimming her 
lamps, if disturbed by an unwelcome visitor, but can soon re- 
kindle them when her fears are over. This I have often proved 
in passing and repassing a marked individual. These insects 
hide themselves by day ; as then their enemies (some of the 
warblers, it is supposed) are on the alert. — J. Main. Dec, 24.

What is the Difference in the Appearance of the Larva and 
Imago of the common Glowworm (Lampjris noctiluca h.) F — 
On Sept. 2. 1833, I took many glowworms, near Keswick, 
Cumberland, having been attracted to them by their light. 
The light was much paler than that seen in July. I collected 
them of all sizes. If the larva emits light, can it be called the 
torch of Hymen ? — Edward Wilson^ jun. Chapel AUei'ton, 
near Leeds, April 15, 1833.

The Eggs of the Gloimsoorm (Lampy7'is noctiluca L.) are 
luminous. — A young lady lately showed me some eggs of the 
glowworm (i^ampyris noctiluca i.), which emitted a pale green- 
ish light in the dark, and continued to do so for three or four 
days after they had been deposited. I am not aware that this 
fact has been before noticed. The eggs are globular, of a pale 
yellow colour, and about one twentieth part of an inch in dia- 
meter. — Hugh E. Stricldand, Worcester shire, July 21, 1833. 

[Mr. Main marks from " midsummer to the end of August," 
for the usual period of glowworms being seen in a luminous 
state. Mr. Bree has seen a luminous glowworm as early as 
June 14. (see VI. 491.), and as late as the end of October 
(V. 367, 368.); Mr. Wilson has seen some (see above) as late 
as Sept. 2.] 

Interesting Facts in relation to a Species of Beetle [SilpkaP) 
and the Scolophidra electrica L. (11. 406., V. 368. 400.) — As 
I was passing through the ornamental grounds of a friend, on 
an evening in September, 1832, my attention was directed to a 
luminous appearance on one of the flower-beds. The accu- 
mulation of light seeming too great to proceed from the taper 
of a glowworm, or from any other insect, I approached for 
the purpose of examination, and I had the gratification of 
witnessing the following curious and beautiful exhibition : — 
A spot of ground, nearly a square in form, and not less than 
six or seven inches across, was totally suffused with luminous 
matter ; within this spot was a beetle, which I should say, judg- 
ing from its shape, was a Silpha. This was also covered with 
the fiery fluid, and seemed to be bewildered by it ; for its 
proceedings were most irregular and extraordinary. Now it 
traversed the illuminated space in a manner the most rapid 
and confused ; now it suddenly stopped, and thrust its head 
against the soil, to rub off the matter with which it was sur- 
charged, and again it resumed its headlong course in a series 
of perpetually decreasing circles. This practice was con- 
tinually repeated; and, in short, the poor insect seemed so 
stupified that it was incapable of pursuing a rectilinear course 
sufficiently long to extricate itself from the enlightened area. 



Coleopterous Insects. 253 

While the beetle was entertaining me with this singular scene, 
a ^colopendra electrica, a perfect line of silvery light, was, at 
the same time, at the distance of three or four inches from the 
exterior of the illuminated spot, slowly, but gracefully, wind- 
ing its way, without leaving the least mark or vestige by which 
its course could be discovered. The whole spectacle was 
most splendid; and I deem it worthy of communication, 
because, in my humble judgment, it serves to corroborate the 
suggestion of those admirable observers of nature, Messrs. 
Kirby and Spence, " that the luminous substance is probably 
given to some insects as a means of defence." In the case 
before us, the beetle probably attacked the <Scolopendra, and 
a severe struggle ensued, in the course of which the latter 
discharged the luminous fluid, and, by so doing, stupified its 
enemy and preserved itself. There is one circumstance 
equally worthy our observation and admiration. Admitting 
that the ^Scolopendra is furnished [with a large reservoir of 
luminous matter, still must that matter be of an extraordinary 
and surprising nature to allow of such attenuation and expan- 
sion as I have described, without suffering any diminution of 
splendour and refulgence. It would have been a gratification 
to have been able to say what became of the beetle ; whether 
it ultimately extricated itself, or fell a victim to the powerful 
substance in which it was enveloped ; but I was unfortunately 
driven from my station by a heavy fall of rain, and was desti- 
tute of all means by which an insect can be secured. — J, S, 7\ 
April 29. 1833. 

On walking with a friend, one evening after dark, at 
Michaelmas time, in the village of Horningsheath, Suffolk, 
named above, we were attracted by a patch of brilliant light, 
the size of the palm of my hand, or larger, on the side of the 
hedgebank which skirted our path ; and within the extent of 
this light we could perceive an insect of considerable size 
moving about. A glowworm (Zyampyris), no doubt, thought I, 
and secured the moving insect by putting it into my hat ; and 
this done, we returned to a party we had left at the cottage 
from which we had taken our stroll. We had hoped to gra- 
tify the party with a sight of our glowworm, when, on taking 
off my hat before the candle, my insect proved devoid of 
luminousness, and, to my horror, no glowworm, but Goerius 
olens. Then, since, and now, I could and can only account 
for finding this wolf of insects within the broad patch of light, 
by supposing that it, in its evening foraging, had met with a 
glowworm, and that this, in its resistance of the grasp oi', and 
struggles against, the Goerius, had suffused the earth with the 
patch of light which we had seen. See also in I. ^99. — ,/. IX 



254 Short Commimicatioyis : — 

The Goerius (Stap/ii/Unus) dle?is, or Great Rove Beetle, has, 
in some places, the complimentary title of the devil's coach- 
horse ; and, by the children in Cambridgeshire, is called 
cocktail, from its habit of turning up, when irritated, its ab- 
domen, armed at the extremity, over its body or thorax. 
This creature kills and devours beetles small and large, ear- 
wigs, woodlice (Oniscus ^sellus), earthworms, perhaps glow- 
worms (see before), and I have known it eat of the putrid 
remains of the great snail of gardens (H^Vix aspersa). To 
the earthworm the Goerius is a dire enemy. It fixes its 
piercing cutting mandibles into the soft flesh of the worm, and 
almost buries its head within it, and becomes too fastly fixed 
for all the writhing and contortions of the worm to produce 
the effect of dislodging it. In the course of gardening prac- 
tice, I have seen several earthworms under this painful inflic- 
tion from individuals of the Goerius. The instance of its 
eating of the putrid remains of a garden snail, I witnessed on 
July 8. 1829. My memorandum says, " this might be 
because that, in consequence of the heat now, no dewworms 
occur near the earth's surface." On October 16. 1831, I 
met with a G. 61ens, accompanied by the following circum- 
stances : — it lay dead in a bye footpath ; it had been partially 
crushed, and had in its mandibles a dead earwig, while the 
earwig had within its forceps a tarsus of, and off" the left 
fore leg of, the Goerius. Near the Goerius lay a pearly egg, 
about two tenths of an inch long, and more than one tenth of 
an inch in diameter. The shell of the egg was of the con- 
sistence of parchment, and the yolk it enclosed was viscous 
and of a yellowish white colour. This, doubtless, was the 
egg of the Goerius which the same passing foot that had par- 
tially crushed its body, and thus destroyed the destroyer, 
had, perhaps, prematurely forced out of it. I dissected the 
remains of the Goerius, but did not perceive another egg, or 
the rudiments of one, within them. 

In Kirby and Spence's Introd. ed. 1818, vol. ii. p. 237.j 
5taphylinus (Goerius) olens F. and the Forficula gigantea F, 
are mentioned as insects which brandish their armed ab- 
domens as a *' means of defence." It may be right to add to 
these the common earwig (Forficula auricularia), which, in a 
moment, if molested about the head, endeavours to punish 
the molester with the forceps at its tail: so also, doubtless, 
the F. minor (on whose flight I have recorded a fact in 
IV. p. 436.) In Kirby and Spence's Introd., ed. 1818, vol. iii. 
p. 33., iStaphylinus olens is set down at one twelfth of an inch 
in length : is not this a misprint for I-y^ in. ? — J, D.

obvious Noise, and in tkeJbllo'wi?ig Manner. — Upon my pierc- 
ing a specimen of this insect, through the elytron with a pin, 
I was surprised to hear it emit a very curious noise, of which 
I will endeavour to convey an idea; for although 1 observe 
that this fact has been noticed in another quarter, yet the de- 
scription there given is, in my opinion, too vague to allow a 
reader to form any notion of it. The noise is more like bark- 
ing than any other noise to which I can compare it ; the voice, 
if I may be allowed that term, being acute and distinct, yet 
not audible at a great distance. It is not heard except when 
the insect moves its head and thorax up and down, and it ap- 
pears to be caused by the latter rubbing against the juncture 
which exists between that part and the elytra and abdomen. 
If the insect be held by the body, or the finger be pressed 
upon its elytra, so as to detain it underneath, the noise is im- 
mediately produced in its endeavours to release itself. Whe- 
ther it produces this noise when at liberty, I know not, having 
never seen but this one specimen. I may remark that it is a 
considerable time in dying upon the pin ; my specimen, although 
impaled and exposed to strong spirits of ammonia, survived 
this treatment four days. — James Fennell. Paddington, Aug.

Notes on some Species of Insects "which consume Pidse, Grain, 
Biscuits, Sfc. — I remember that the beans, and, I believe, 
other corn, of the Cambridgeshire farmers, when thrashed, 
dressed, and laid by, used to be, in the days of my boyhood 
(and, doubtless, is still), infested with a small insect, which my 
fellow boys used to call a mide or wule. Perhaps this is but a 
corruption of the word weevil ; but, if my recollection is accu- 
rate, the insect itself, which was very common, and very abun- 
dant, was one of the Ptinidae, not of the Curculionidae. — J. D. 
In relation to this remark, which was written anterior to 
Christmas time, 1832, I then sought for specimens of the 
expected ptinideous insects among some few old peas and old 
beans, which had lain by for two years or so at my father's 
( Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire); and, although some of the 
peas were strung together, and some of the beans also, by the 
matted webs and excrement of insects that had gnawed them, 
I could then find but very few larva?, and only one perfect and 
live insect, an elegant curculionideous one, whose presence 
there, my prejudice inclined me to suppose, might be accidental. 



256 Short Commimications : — 

On returning, I submitted the insect and the amount of my 
notion, to Mr. Westvvood, who was so kind as to reply as 
follows. 

March, 1833. Respecting your impression that the Cam- 
bridge mules, or wules, which attack the dried peas and beans, 
are not curculionideous, but rather ptinideous, I can give you no 
information from direct observation. The insectwhich you have 
enclosed found alive at Christmas, among the peas, is certainly 
the corn weevil, Curculio {Caldndra) granaria. For my own 
part, I think its occurrence in this situation, at that period, and 
in company with larvae, was not accidental; because insects of 
this kind are found in the larva, pupa, and imago state, at the 
same time. The date of your capturing the specimen of the 
weevil, therefore, affords no clue to the decision of the ques- 
tion ; for these kinds of indoor insects seem to take but little 
notice of the seasons. Moreover, the Caldndra does not con- 
fine itself to the wheat in an undressed state ; since your valued 
correspondent, C. A. Babington, Esq., has kindly supplied 
me with specimens of the insect which were found in the de- 
cayed floors, and under heaps of malt, in a malt-house in 
Cambridge, the grains of which they devoured. In company 
with this insect were also found in profusion the following 
beetles : — Trogositacaraboides, Cucujus monilicornis, Alphito- 
phagus quadripustulatus, and Tenebrio molitor. The ship 
biscuit is also equally attacked by the Caldndra ; and Sparrmann 
(vol. i. p. 103., quoted by Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 228.) 
mentions that it infests grmmd peas used on board of ship. 
Thus the chances are that the occurrence of your single 
specimen of Caldndra among the peas was not accidental. 
On the other hand, it is by no means improbable that your 
supposition that one of the Ptinidae, belonging to the genus 
Anobium, may, by the Cambridge farmers, be termed the 
weevil or mule, or wule ; and, in fact, that the larvae which you 
found were those of a species of Anobium, the term weevil 
being employed (as it appears to me) in a generic sense to 
designate any insect found feeding upon grain, in the manner of 
the C(a/«wc?r«, without reference to its possession or want of aros- 
trum [by the possession of which the Curculionidae are cha- 
racterised]. Hence the term weevil would be at once applied 
to an Anobium, or any one, or all, of the other insects found by 
Mr. Babington, if it, or they, were caught preying upon grain : 
and it happens that an insect decribed by Linnaeus under the 
name of /<)ermestes paniceus is stated by Sparrmann to attack 
the biscuit and ground peas, in conjunction with the true weevil 
{Caldndra granaria). This insect Messrs. Kirby and Spence 
consider to belong to the genus Cryptophagus, from having 
observed that a beetle of that genus (thus making a farther 



Coleopterous Insects, 257 

addition to the number of misnamed weevils) often swarmed 
in the ship biscuit. Gyllenhall, Fabricius, &c., followed by 
our recent English entomologists, consider, however, the 
Z)ermestes paniceus to be an Anobium ; and the observations 
of Mr. Stephens upon the habits of the Anobium paniceum 
seem to prove the correctness of such opinion. This author, 
in his invaluable descriptions of British insects, states that its 
larva " feeds upon farinaceous substances, and is particularly 
attached to old bread and wafers, the latter of which it fastens 
together in masses of three or four, within which it undergoes 
its metamorphosis, the insect appearing in plenty in June : it 
will also attack neglected collections of insects." [Illustr. 
Coleoptera, vol. iii. p. 341.) This, however, is the only species 
of Anobium which is recorded as being attached to such sub- 
stances. — J,0, Westwood. March , 1833. 

On April 16. 1833, I obtained (at my father's), from among 
peas and beans, a larva, on which Mr. Westwood, on my send- 
ing It to him, favoured me with the following remarks, on 

May 22. In addition to what I have stated respecting the 
various insects which attack grain and pulse, and which thence 
appear to have received, in common, the name of weevils or 
wules, or mules, it may be stated of the dried peas or beans of 
which you have recently forwarded me a small boxful, that 
they were infested by a small grub which eats through and 
attaches together, by silken ties, several of them, filling up the 
interstices of the web with its own excrement, so as to form a 
gallery, from which It occasionally protrudes its head, some- 
what like the grubs of the caddis flies (Phryganeae). It is 
evidently the larva of the little moth, 7'inea granella, which 
appears to have occasioned much alarm on the Continent. 
This, therefore, is another insect to which the name of wule 
would, in common parlance, be applicable. 

The seeds of other leguminous plants, or, as they are com- 
monly termed, pulse, are subject, in different parts of the world, 
to the attacks of other insect depredators, especially the vari- 
ous species of ^ruchus, numerous instances of which are re- 
corded by Messrs. Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 178. 3d edit, 
[p. 175. of the 4th edit.]. Another instance has recently 
occurred of the depredation committed by another species of 
this genus. Dr. Hamilton of Plymouth having recently 
transmitted to Mr. Loudon seeds of the CffisalpinzVz Coriaria, 
or dividivi, " the legumes of which are so valuable as a substi- 
tute both for oak bark and galls, some of tiie seeds contained 
the insect aiughi JIagr ante delicto^' [in the very act of eating 
them]. These seeds are about a C|uarter of an inch in length, 
and of an oval flattened form, like small beans; and in the in-

jured specimens, on the upper side, at one end, is a circular 
aperture, sufficiently large to show that the interior of the seed 
has been entirely eaten, and the space is occupied by a small 
beetle, which, upon extraction, proves to be a species of 
^ruchus (somewhat smaller than the common J5ruchus grana- 
rius which infests our peas), with the wing cases of a dark 
reddish brown colour, with several dull greyish lines along the 
upper surface. Its history is doubtless similar to that of the 
common pea J5ruchus, the female of which deposits her eggs 
in the seed, whilst the pod is in a comparatively small and 
young state. When hatched, the grub feeds upon the seed in 
which it was deposited, and which is amply sufficient for its 
nourishment. There seems, however, to be this difference in 
the economy of the two species : J5ruchus granarius leaves the 
pea, and eats through the pod, whilst in the larva state, so as 
to undergo its transformations in the earth ; whilst it would 
seem that the Z^ruchus of the seeds of the Caesalpin/a Coriaria 
passes its pupa state in the seed, in the inside of which it 
assumes the perfect state. Dr. Hamilton adds, " I have fre- 
quently received the insects in a living state, when seeds of 
the Caesalpin/fl Coriaria have arrived from Carthagena in July 
and August. In these cases, on the parcels being opened, 
they have expanded their little wings, and flown about in all 
directions." — J. O. Westxmod, May 22. 1833.

Hemipterous Insects. — Notonecta;^ the Boatjlies. — These 
are very curious insects. In August last, I caught three in a 
small piece of water in my garden ; two of which turned out 
to be the N. furcata, and the other N. glaiica ; and, having 
put them in a large tumbler of water, I kept them for several 
weeks. These individuals were about three quarters of an 
inch long, having six legs (or, more properly speaking, four 
legs, and two other appendages), which they use as oars ; 
much longer than the others, three-jointed, and fringed with 
hairs. The eyes are large and prominent. On each side of 
the abdomen are tufts of hair. The elytra, or wing-cases, 
are hard ; and, on removing this covering, the wings are found 
beautifully folded up. Although the water appears to be their 
natural element, yet they are able to live a long time out of 
it, as I had an opportunity of experiencing. One of my 
specimens I discovered one morning lying motionless on the 
v/ater, to all appearance dead. I took it up, and put it in a 
box, intending to dissect it the first convenient opportunity. 



Hemiptermis Liseds. 259 

The following day, I was about to commence my operations, 
and was not a little surprised to find it alive ; and, on restor- 
ing it to the water, it swam away as merrily as ever : it having, 
like spiders and many other insects, feigned death. Their 
position in the water is on the back [?idtos, the back ; nekfes, a 
swimmer] ; and, by means of their oars, they cut along and 
through the water with surprising rapidity. By occasionally 
changing the water, and always keeping the fragment of a 
leaf (a water-lily leaf is the best, because it is porous and will 
float) on the surface, they may be kept for a long time in this 
confinement. They usually keep by the edge of the leaf; 
and, whenever a fly or any other small insect falls or is thrown 
on the water, one or other of them will seize it in an instant ; 
clasping it with its legs, and sucking its juices through the 
proboscis, which, when not feeding, lies along the thorax. 
Though not so voracious as the large water beetle (Z)ytiscus 
marginalis), which, as Mr. Knapp says, " riots the Polyphe- 
mus of the pool," they are bold and greedy, and will attack 
both spiders and earwigs, and devour several of them in quick 
succession. The oars (if they may be so called) of this insect 
are admirably adapted to its mode of life while in the water; 
but, when they have occasion to change the element, they 
apparently are greatly embarrassed with them from their 
length, which causes them to walk in an awkward and ridi- 
culous manner ; and their progress is, consequently, slow and 
laboured. Where and when they deposit their eggs, or how 
long they remain in their larva state, I have not been able to 
observe, nor to find recorded, anywhere. The only mention 
of the insect that I can find in Mr. Rennie's three volumes on 
insects, in the Library of' Entertaining Knoisoledge, is the brief 
one in Insect Miscellanies, p. 187. (erroneously referred to in 
the index as "p. 178."): — "Ray tells us that his friend 
Willughby had sufl^ered severe temporary pain, in the same 
way [that is, from the sting], from a water bug (Notonecta 
glauca Lin.). — Hist. Insect., p. 58." As Ray*s entire de- 
scription is very short, and admirably accurate, I beg to give 
it : — " Unciae f longa est ; elytra fusca sunt ; scapulae vi- 
rescunt ; posterius par pedum valde longum remorum instar ; 
antennis caret ; proboscis brevis est, qua in cutem intrusa

during the night, I cannot determine. The N. glauca, from 
time to time, deposited its eggs : they are about one six-

yellow colour, and so heavy that they fall to the bottom of 
the water. — Willimn Gardiner, jun, Dundee, April 6, 1833.

the sea coast of Kent and Sussex. During the last two sea- 
sons (1832 and 1833), however, it has made its appearance and 
has been captured, in comparative abundance, near Deal and 
Walmer, and in the vicinity of Dover. The following notices, 
which have been communicated to me by Miss Harvey of 
Upper Deal, a lady whose taste has made her conversant 
with all branches of natural history, may not be without 
interest to your entomological readers. Towards the end of 
July, or beginning of August, 1832, no less than fourteen 
specimens of C. Hyak were taken near Deal, by a young ento- 
mologist, who at the time was not aware of the rarity of the 
insect ; two others were likewise taken, by different persons, 
about the same time and place ; and three also by Mr. Le 
Plastrier, in the neighbourhood of Dover : in all, nineteen 
specimens in the season of 1832. In the beginning of August, 
1833, four specimens were taken by the above-mentioned 
young entomologist, near Deal, and nine by my kind in- 
formant. Miss Harvey herself, on August 19, 20, and 22.; 
besides three others, which were seen, but not captured : Mr. 
Le Plastrier also succeeded in procuring four near Dover ; 
making twenty specimens in the summer of 1833. 

The occasional, yet indeterminate, appearance of these and 
some other Papilionidae, especially Vanessa Antiopa* and 



sothemc, if we may judge from the British specimens so called, appears to 
be scarcely distinguishable from Ediisa ; and C. Helice is no other than 
a white variety of the female Edusa. Thus the well-ascertained British 
species will be reduced to Edusa and Hyale. 

* " There is something very extraordinary in the periodical but irre- 
gular appearances of this species (Antiopa), Edus«, and cardui. They are 
plentiful all over the kingdom in some years, after which, Antiopa, in 
particular, cannot be seen by any one for eight or ten or more years, and 
then appear again as plentiful as before. To suppose they come from the 
Continent is an idle conjecture, because the English specimens are easily 
distinguished from all others by the superior whiteness of their borders. 
Perhaps their eggs, in this climate, like the seeds of some vegetables, may 
occasionally lie dormant for several seasons, and not hatch, until some 
extraordinary but undiscovered coincidences awaken them into active life." 
[On the relation of the eggs of certain insects to seasons, see Mr. Brown 
in p. 24-6.] 

My lamented friend the late Mr. Haworth, from whose work (Lepi- 
doptcrn Jiritannicay p. 28.) the above remark is quoted, once suggested to 
me, that it might probably require two or more extraordinarily fine seasons 
in succession to produce a British Antiopfl'. The theory, however, as he 
afterwards candidly admitted, was not found to be borne out by experience. 
Many years ago, this fine insect was so plentiful in Norfolk, that, as Mr. 
Haworth assured me, a friend of his was able to cai)ture it during the 
season, even on wet or cloudy days, as it sat in a quiescent state among 
the foliage of the oak, &:c. About fourteen or sixteen years ago, the species 
made its aj)pearance in the neighbourhood of Coomb, near Coventry, and 
attracted the attention even of non-eutoniological observers.

262 Shcn't Comtnunications ; — 

Cynthia cardui, is a point which entomologists have hitherto 
been unable to account for. Experience shows that it does 
not depend on the warmth and fineness of the summer, nor 
on the mildness of the preceding winter ; nor can it be satis- 
factorily attrib^ited to any known cause. As, however, these 
two allied species, C. Edusa and Hyal<?, are both subject (as 
already said) to similar irregularities in their appearances, it 
might be expected that the same circumstances (whatever 
they may be) which prove favourable to a copious flight of 
the one, should also be alike favourable to that of the other. 
This, however, appears not to be the case. In the year 
1831, when I happened to be resident at Dover, in August 
and September [see V. 330.], C. Edus« was to be met with 
in tolerable abundance ; very many specimens were seen and 
captured ; in short, it was considered (as I was informed) 
a more than usually good season for the insect in that neigh- 
bourhood. No specimens, however, of C. Hyak (so far as I 
am aware) were taken or seen in the district that year, save one 
in the possession of Miss Harvey, captured in the month of 
June. Again, the seasons of 1832 and 1133, in which so 
many specimens of C. Hyak were met with, did not (as I am 
informed) produce a corresponding abundant supply of 
C. Edus«. Miss Harvey speaks of having seen only two 
examples of this insect in 1833, and of Mr. Le Plastrier 
having taken several between Dover and St. Margaret's in the 
end oT September. She also mentions that Cynthia cardui 
appeared at Deal in the first week of October, in greater 
abundance than she had seen it for five years. This insect 
was also plentiful about Dover in the autumn of 1831. In 
Warwickshire I have not seen a single specimen of C. cardui 
during the present autumn. 

These periodical appearances of particular insects are cer- 
tainly curious. Should the above remarks attract the attention 
of your readers, some may, perhaps, be able to throw more 
light upon the subject. All that I have to offer is a bare 
statement of the facts. — W, T, Bree. Allesley Rectory, Octo-

A Profile of the Human Face is observable upon the upper 
Side of the Primary Wings ofCblias Edus^i, female. A Profile of 
Chancellor Brougham is observable on the Reverse of Hipparchisi 
Jatiira. — It is observed, in vol. i. p. 518. of the E7itomological 
Magazine, " that on the reverse of Hipparchia Janir« may be 
traced a very tolerably defined profile, in some specimens no 
very bad likeness, of the Lord Chancellor Brougham." This 
is not very evident in the specimens I have examined. A 
much stronger resemblance of the human profile (I do not 



Lepidopterous Insects* 263 

say portrait of the chancellor) is exhibited on the upper side 
of the primary wings of the female of Collar Ediis«. In some 
specimens, which, I need hardly observe, vary very much, the 
face is so conspicuous, as at once to catch the eye of the 
beholder on the first inspection of the insect. The black spot 
towards the centre of the wing forms the eye of the profile ; 
the profile itself being yellow upon a black ground, and 
fronting the tip of the wing. — W, T, Bree. Allesley Rectory^

Vanessa urticce^ a singular Variety of^ captured near Lei-

wings is, as usual, red ; in each wing two of the abbreviate 
bands of black, and the intermediate one of pale orange, 
coalesce into a dark blotch ; and two of the smaller spots are 
wanting. The band on the posterior margin is less distinct 
than in ordinary specimens; the blue, and yellow edging 
entirely wanting. The inferior wings are brown, with a 
lighter tinge towards the base, and very indistinct markings 
at the edgings. The individual was captured by my brother, 
Mr. J. G. Glossop, and myself, in one of our entomological 
rambles. — F. H, N. Glossop, Etiderby, near Leicester, Nov,

scales at the middle and another at the apex, the posterior 
fuscous outside ; the tips of the joints of the tarsi fuscous. It 
resembles, in size and appearance, the P. megadactylus of 
Hlib. ; but the falcated apex to the lower lobe of the superior 
wings will at once distinguish it: and the legs are spotted and 
very similar to those of P. trigonodiictylus Haxi\ ; but it does 
not belong to the same section." [Curt, MSS.) It was first

P. spilodactylus Curtis^ Br. Ent. PL — I found a larva of 
this moth at Blackgang Chine, Isle of Wight, on some worm- 
wood, June 10. 1832, which produced the moth in July 11. 
following. The larva is rather darker, but very similar to that 
of galactodactylus (which is light green, with a white pubes- 
cence), and is found on the underside of burdock leaves, close 
to the fibres, which it so much resembles that it requires 
some care to discover it. I found it in Clapham Park 
Wood, Beds., on May 30. 1820, and bred it on June 29. fol- 
lowing ; since which I have found it in plenty in a wood near 
Andover, Reading, and at Glanville's Wootton. 

P. carphodact}'lus Hiib.^ or citridactylus Haw. I took two 
specimens at Glanville's Wootton, May 15. and June 1. 1818 ; 
and Mr. B. Standish sent me one from Whittleseamere, 
August 4. 1821 ; since which time I have not found it. Mr. 
Curtis took P. tephradactylus Hilh..^ in the Isle of Arran, 
which is the only one I have ever seen alive. P. trigono- 
dactylus I generally take in plenty, where the coltsfoot grows, 
at Barton Cliff, Hants; one also at Glanville's Wootton, and 
another at Loch Rannoch, in constant succession, from May 20. 
to October 4. What I have seen in cabinets as P. calodac- 
tylus, tesseradactylus, and punctidactylus, appear to me to be 
varieties only of one species : they all appear here from April 
to October, and are by no means rare ; and the P. calodac- 
tylus I found in the Isle of Arran, and near Arrochar and 
Loch Katrine, in Scotland. This last seems the most distinct 
of the tln'ee, being of a reddish colour ; but I see no character 
that can be called specific which will not comprehend the other 
two; and it is perhaps doubtful if more than one be synony- 
mous with the Continental species. Mr. Curtis gave me a 
pair of Adactylus Bennet/z Br. Ent. PL, a species which has 
the wings undivided ; and Mr. Llaworth had or^e allied to 
hexadactylus, taken by Mr. Stone, and to which he gave the 
name of plilodactylus. — J. C. Date. Blanclford, Ja?i. 5. 1834. 

Hymenopi^erous Insects. — Ycspa hritannica (VI. 538.)

by me some specimens of this insect taken in 1828 from a 
nest in a bank. I have also some nests similar to figs. 69, 
70. (VI. 537.), taken from beehives, but I cannot say to what 
species they belong, not having captured the architects. 
Three years ago, a beautiful globular nest, about 8 in. in 
diameter, was shown to me, suspended from a branch of a 
fir tree in a shrubbery; ^nd a few nights after, I cut down 
the branch, and made preparations for suffocating the in-

the nest which he had obtained of that species. — H. E. Strick-

here last summer. Half a dozen or more might always be

garden was full of them, and they devoured nearly the whole 
of the latest ripe red gooseberries. Eight or ten nests were 
destroyed within 50 yards of the house. — A Subscriber. Vale

Wasps will partake of the extravasated sap which drains 
down the exterior of trunks of diseased elm trees; at least, I 
witnessed two doing this, on July 27. 1833, in Kensington 
Gardens : with them, and also partaking of the sap, were a 
blow fly and blue flies. — J. D.

gardens, three, visits of the gooseberry caterpillar. The first 
was a very destructive one; the second was about the end of 
August, or beginning of September; and the third about a 
month later. This is quite unusual here, though apparently 
not so in some other places (see III. 245.) A colony of 
wood ants (i^ormlca riifa?) in a garden is found here of great 
effect in keeping it clear of this pest. — A Sid)scriber, Vale

Nematus of the gooseberry and currant bushes, though it 
nearly resembles N. criprea3, and has been confounded witli it

be a distinct species ; it has been named Nematus ribesii by

took has since developed an imago ; and this, with the cocoon, 
has been submitted to an eminent entomologist, who has pro-

" Tenthredo amerince Lin. is a very scarce insect ; and, 
although it is said to occur in Britain, I doubt the fact. One 
mutilated specimen, of doubtful origin, is in one of the London 
cabinets." 

Our correspondent thinks that the larva of Trichiosoma 
lucorum, which displayed the facts described, might be a dis- 
eased individual. If so, its acts may not be usual to the 
species. Additional observation, which, as the insect is not 
rare in Britain, many can give, is necessary to determine this.

perty in ichneumons, I would only wish to corroborate Mr. 
Lewis's statement, not to claim the discovery." Of the 
species of hymenopterous insects, carnivorous in a winged 
state, Mr. Westwood has, in VI. 417., instanced the Pimpla 
stercorator (the species whose acts Mr. Lewis has there de- 
scribed), wasps, and ants; probably the .Sphex sabulosa may 
be added to these (see VI. 477., and Gill's Technicolo- 
gical Repositcny, for Oct. 1828); and possibly the species of 
ichneumon which Mr. Newman has observed, in a winged 
state, to devour larvae, are farther additions to the list of 
hymenopterous insects which are, in the winged state, car- 
nivorous. — J. D,

Ants conveying in their Mouths other Ants of their o^don Spe- 
cies (VI. 287. and 476.) ; and the Courage of the Wood or Fallow 
Ant (Formica rifa). — On the habits of ants, I would parti- 
cularly recommend to the reader the Natural History of Ants, 
by M. P. Huber (translated by J. R. Johnson, M!D., Lon- 
don, 1820), as exceedingly interesting. According to my own 
observations, the practice of ants carrying each other is very 



Hymenopterons Insects, 267 

frequent among the wood ants ( JFbrmica rufa) ; but I have not 
been fortunate enough to observe it among the other species. 
Whether, however, this carrying process be for the purpose 
assigned by Huber, that of removing to a new habitation, I 
much doubt. I have never been able to trace the carriers to 
their destination : but, I think, it cannot be for the purpose 
of removing to a new place of habitation ; for the old habi- 
tations, to which my observations have been directed, still 
remain in the same place from year to year, inhabited as usual. 
I would ask, is not this operation confined to particular sea- 
sons? Has any one observed it at all times during the sum- 
mer ? We want more facts on the subject. That the ants 
thus carried are " prisoners taken in a conflict with some 
neighbouring enemy," as supposed by Mr. Hill (VI. 476.)? is, 
I think, improbable. I have always observed, if the carrier 
be deprived of its prey, it will run about confusedly ; but, the 
moment the prey is restored, the carrier immediately takes it 
up again, and there is no resistance offered by the prisoner. 
If they were captives taken in battle, I presume they would 
resist a second capture, or be anxious to make their escape 
when removed from the grasp of the enemy ; but I have never 
seen any disposition of the kind manifested. I have often 
been amused by the courage exhibited by these little beings, 
when disturbed or annoyed. They erect their bodies, fixing 
and balancing themselves by their hind and middle legs, in 
most formidable attitude ; whilst their mandibles and first 
pair of legs are used for defence. When provoked to this, 
they eject a liquid from the mouth with great violence: in 
one instance, I am sure, it was thrown to the distance of three 
inches. The operation is repeated two or three times if the 
provocation be continued, but with less force each time ; and 
they then appear exhausted, and disinclined to continue the 
contest, and decamp with all possible alacrity. — C. Corvway, 
Sept. 21. 1833. 

A Battle hetisoeen Ants of the Species Myrmica rubra, and 
Ants of the Species Myrnuca cce'spitum, — On Sept. 4. 1832, 
I was walking beside a wall a foot or so taller than myself; 
off the upper part of which, in one place, I, in passing, ob- 
served small insects to be descending, as it were, by a flying 
leap. This led my eye to the pathway along which I was 
walking at the foot of the walk, where, for the length of five 
yards, and the width of three, the ground was sprinkled, and, 
as it were, in part animated, with winged ants ; most of them 
in pairs, but some single ones, which seemed to be earnestly 
seeking partners. The pairs were severally comj)osed of a 
red ant and a dark-coloured one, which strenuously combated 



268 Short Commimications : — 

each other ; but I did not at this time feel certain whether 
in the feeUng of love or of war, as the imperfect examin- 
ation I then gave them, and the actions of the single ones, 
left me undecided. The next day, however, cleared up the 
question, by exhibiting numerous dead ants, of both the red 
and dark kinds, on the site of the previous day's activity. I 
picked up dead specimens, which I have since submitted to 
Mr. Westwood ; who has kindly informed me that (as far as 
it is determinable from bad specimens) " the red ones are of 
Myrmica rubra, the dark ones of M. cas'spitum." — J. D, 

Instances of determined Resistance of Detention in the large 
black Wood Ant. (VI. 287.) — A few days since, I caught 
one, and held it by the legs [? leg], but so as not to hurt it. 
After it had made various fruitless efforts to escape, it de- 
liberately and without cessation began to bite off the leg 
[? legs], which it did in about a minute. I caught another, 
which was beginning to do the same thing ; but I let it go. — -

Ants and their carnivorous Habits, as noticed by Mr. West- 
wood, in VI. 417. — In one of the volumes of GilPs Techni- 
cological Repositoiy (the number for June, p. 335, 336.), an 
interesting account is given, by Mr. Carpenter, in amount as 
follows : — In walking across a field, he observed the footpath 
covered, for many yards in length, with the wing-cases of nu- 
merous cockchafers, with a number of the heads of the insects 
still alive, though separated from the rest of their bodies, and the 
bodies of others actually crawling about without heads. The 
cockchafers had been left in that state by the birds, who were 
succeeded in the work of destruction by numerous small black 
ants. These " had crawled up the sides of the chafers, and 
had taken possession of the interior of their bodies, and were 
devouring them alive. Many of the heads, I observed, were 
also being carried away by the ants to their nests. If the 
sense of feeling in these insects was as acute as in the higher 
order of animals, the pain they endured must have been 
dreadful. I had, indeed, before frequently seen an individual 
of one species of insect making a meal from another species ; 
but never before did I witness such a host of cannibals engaged 
in their work of eating up, alive, insects that were actually 
crawling away with their devourers within their bodies ! " 
Be it remembered, that the bodies of the cockchafers, although 
not dead, had been mutilated and mangled by the birds. 
The ants, like the dogs in the city of Constantinople, were 
removing the animal remains, and, by so doing, preventing 
the contribution to miasma which the putrescence of them 
might occasion. I have witnessed several ants engaged in 



Hymenopterous Insects. 269 

removing the dead and partly dried body of an earthworm of 
moderate size. In the kitchen of a house known to me, in 
Kensington Gravel Pits, ants of a very minute species were 
very abundant during the summer of 1833: they would par- 
take of the meat, and of the butter, &c., when they could get 
to it. — J. D. 

A Mode of destroying Ants in gardens is asked for by G. T., 
in Fiiit. Mag., i. 521. These modes for destroying them, or 
attracting them to the end of their being destroyed, have been 
published in the Gard. Mag. v., 730., vii. 315. : — Baits : the 
refuse part of melons, slices of raw turnip rubbed over with 
honey, recently cooked bones of roast or boiled meat or fish. 
Poisons: a well-compounded mixture of equal parts of loaf 
sugar, oxide of arsenic, and well-pulverised white bread, 
strewed, as occasion may require, both as to time and quan- 
tity, in the haunts of the ants. The mixture to be kept in a 
botde dry for use. Ants, however, it seems, by the remarks 
under Nematus ribesii, in p. ^265., may be useful in a garden. 
— J.Z). 

RemarJcs and Facts on Ants. — My children have just finished 
reading a few interesting anecdotes respecting the natural 
history of the ant. I have read in books, and heard from the 
lips of learned teachers, many such anecdotes, chiefly taken 
from the statements of Solomon, that " she (the ant) pro- 
videth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the 
harvest." The gentleman who wrote the book which my 
children have been reading [We presume, a paper in the 
Spectator; as we remember a tantamount paper in that work.] 
says that he had two commonwealths of ants in a flower-box, 
in his window, two stories high, which he thought of planting 
tulips in : but, seeing the ants, he was sorry to disturb them ; 
and was more amused with the ants than he could have been 
with the tulips. This may be true : every one to his taste. 
I am no great admirer of tulips; but I detest a nest of ants. 
Plowever, then follow the anecdotes, many of which are truly 
marvellous. He says that wheat is their favourite food ; but 
that they are also fond of rye and oats. He observed one 
ant bring in its paws [? jaws] a full-sized grain of wheat up to 
the window from the ground ; but, being so tired, it dropped 
it from top to bottom. The ant went down the wall a second 
time, and found its grain of wheat, and brought it back uji 
the wall ; but, just as it was getting it into the box, it dro})ped 
a second time. The ant again descended the wall, and again 
found its favourite grain ; but, being then so very mucli 
fatigued, another ant assisted it to scale the wall, and deposit 
the precious grain in their storehouse ! If the above account 



270 Short Communicatiom i'-^ 

be true, it is very interesting; but, if it be false, it is very 
wrong to put such books into the hands of children. I have 
had as much to do with ants and ant-hills as most men ; and 
never yet could find their winter store of provision, any more 
than I could find honey in a wasp's nest. I have had men 
[levelling down and] spreading ant-hills for days together, 
and have offered them a quart of ale for a thimbleful of the 
ants' winter food, of either wheat, rye, or oats ; but never 
could attain my object, nor the men theirs. I have strewed 
rice and wheat about an ant-hill, and seen them lugging it 
away ; but I firmly believe the stupid creatures only mistook 
it for their own eggs. The ants, like the wasp, and most 
[many] other insects, live entirely upon fluids, or suction; 
and lie quite dormant in the winter: their stomachs could no 
more digest wheat or rye, than my stomach could digest horse- 
nails. The wasp is seen to eat rotten wood, &c. ; but it is 
only for the purpose of forming its comb-cells. The cater- 
pillar and silkworm eat green food ; but this is only for the 
purpose of preparing them for their change. The butterfly 
and moth live only by suction. The ant is nothing more 
than a biennial, or, at most, a triennial insect : when it comes 
to perfection, it becomes a winged insect, propagates its spe- 
cies, and then dies. What sorry naturalists must those, then, 
be who hold up the ant as a pattern for improvident man ? 
Truly, such writers should be looked upon by modern readers 
as quite «w/iquated. 

They are still less acquainted with the history of the ant, 
who say she " hath no guide, overseer, or ruler." I shall 
never forget the first time I saw a nest of the large black ant ; 
it was in a large forest in the south of England. I saw some- 
thing alive lying right across my footpath : I took it for some 
monstrous serpent ; but, on looking more attentively, I per- 
ceived it to be a thoroughfare of black ants : it actually re- 
sembled one of the crowded streets of London. I traced it 
to both ends: the one terminated at a huge ant-hill, as large 
as a heaped-up bushel; the other end went up a huge oak 
tree, and there dispersed all over the limbs, branches, and 
twigs of the tree. Is it to be thought that they were " pre- 
paring the acorns as food in the summer, to be gathered by 
them as meat in the harvest?" Really, these large ants 
might lug away small acorns, on level ground, as easily as the 
small red ant could carry a large grain of wheat up a brick 
wall two stories high. But, no ; they were merely sucking 
the honey-dews, and excretions proceeding from smaller in- 
sects. Neither would they all have kept one track if they had 
not had a guide ; nor brought home their full bellies, if they

had not had a governor, or, what is more likely, some self' 

interest I wish my homely remarks may prevent the 

telling again of any untrue statements of the foresight, &c., 
of the ant, to children. — John Hoivden. 

Dipterous Insects, with others. — A Mode of deterring 
House-Flies from entering Apartments, — A paper, by W. 
Spence, Esq., was read at the last Meeting (April 1.) of the 
Entomological Society, on the mode successfully adopted, in 
Italy, of excluding these pests of hot climates, in the au- 
tumnal months, from apartments. The mode is, simply, 
keeping constantly nailed on the outside of the windows 
thread nets, with meshes of an inch or more in diameter ; 
through which, though the windows (French) are wide open, 
the flies (eicher taking the nets for spiders' webs, or from 
some inexplicable dread) never attempt to pass : and thus, in 
a room so defended, not a fly is to be found, while they 
swarm elsewhere. Mr. Spence concluded his paper by ad- 
verting to an unexpected coincidence, which had occurred to 
his eldest son, between this practice and a similar one men- 
tioned by Herodotus (lib. ii. cap. 95.), as having been practised 
by the Egyptian fishermen, 2300 years ago, of securing them- 
selves from the attacks of gnats. [See Mr. Sells's notice of 
the use of the mosquito net, in V. 480.] 

Plants.' — Malcbmia maritima Brown a British Plant, — 
The merit of having first added this lively little annual to the 
British Flora, I believe, is due to Miss Harvey of Upper 
Deal, a lady zealously devoted to natural history, who has 
kindly supplied me with specimens gathered by herself, in 
April last, " under the cliff' about halfway between St. Mar- 
garet's and Dover, in various places, for a quarter of a mile, 
where the banks were grassy. The specimens exactly resem- 
ble the garden ones, save that the leaves and plant are alto- 
gether smaller." Of the specimens sent me, few exceed two 
inches in height, and some scarcely one. 

The sea coast, it may be remarked, must always be con- 
sidered, more or less, a somewhat suspicious habitat for any 
plant of exotic aspect, there being so many chances of foreign 
seeds, or even roots, having been accidentally thrown on 
shore, and deposited in such situations. 

The Gnci'nsey JLily (Amarylliii sarniensis L. fil.), a native of 
Japan, owes its establishment, as a species indigenous to 
European soil, to the melancholy circumstance of a Dutch or 
English ship, coming from Japan, having been cast away on 
the island, from which the plant has acquired its ordinary 
English appellation. 

Nevertheless, we ought not any longer to deny the Med iter- 



272 Short Commu7iicatio7is : — 

ranean stock a place in the list of natives, since, at the very 
least, it now appears to have become naturalised on our shore, 
and at any rate may, with as much propriety, be considered 
a British plant, as many others whose claims have been ad- 
mitted. My intelligent informant very justly remarks that 
" there are no gardens or houses under the cliff between 
St. Margaret's and Dover, nor are there any in that direction 
above near the cliff;" so that it is not likely the stock in 
this situation should have been the mere outcast of a garden. 

While on the subject of Kentish botany, I take the oppor- 
tunity of stating that Miss Harvey finds the beautiful 

(Splirys fucifera in great inqfiision at particular spots be- 
tween Walmer and St. Margaret's. In a letter accompanying 
some fresh specimens in flower, received in May last, she 
remarks : — " Two years ago I found five specimens, and 
thought myself fortunate : within the last week I have gathered 
three hundred, and yet have left an abundance. They seem 
more prolific than any of the orchis tribe. The specimens vary 
very much in the number and colour of the flowers, and in 
the size of the leaves." (See Catalogue of rare or remarkable 
Phcenogamotis Plants collected in South Kent^ by G. E, Smith.) —

Alyssum maritimum Lam. is another plant abundant on the 
shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and supposed to have arisen 
on the shores of Britain from seeds borne hither, on the waves, 
from the former place. Mr. Winch has, in some one of his 
published works, enumerated all those species of the plants 
called British which he conceives to be not aboriginally so, 
and has traced the first appearance here of some of them to 
the importation of ballast, and to other adventitious sources.

Trichonema Bulhoc&diiim Ker grows wild, in great abund- 
ance, among turf, in a dry sandy soil, on the Warren (a 
sandy tract) between Dawlish and Exmouth, Devonshire. 
The exact spot is on the left of the old road from Exeter to 
Dawlish, before you ascend the hill to Mount Pleasant, and 
almost in front of the small cottages there : it extends, at 
intervals, to the ^avry. My friend W. C. Trevelyan, Esq., 
of Wallington, Northumberland, and myself, found it there, 
on March 24<. 1834, in full flower: its ribbed corolla, of a 
purplish blue colour, is strikingly beautiful. Trichonema 
(/xia) Bulbocodium has never before been found wild in 
England. It is well figured, in English Botany, as a native 
of Guernsey; and it abounds in the south of Europe. — John

coverable in its only known British habitat, near Plymouth, 
to which I was directed by Mr. Banks himself, and which I 
diHgently explored. I have gathered A. arvensis wild on the 
Continent, where its habitats differ in condition from that 
at Plymouth. From all I could learn, I was led to conclude 
that the appearance of this plant, in the Plymouth habitat, 
was purely adventitious ; and that it must, until new habitats 
shall have been discovered, be expunged from the list of 
native British vegetables. — W. A, BromfM, M.D, Hastings, 
Feb. 8. 1834. 

Doronicum Vardalianches L. grows, in comparative abund- 
ance, at Saling, near Great Bardfield, in Essex ; but it may, 
from its situation on the bank of an old enclosure, where 
there is an ancient mansion, have escaped from a garden 
[either by the wind's disseminating some of the winged fruits 
(seeds) of its discoid florets (those of its rayed florets are not 
winged), or from some of its abundantly produced stolones 
having been removed from the garden as rubbish]. — J. G, 
Lexdeii, '6d of Mh Month (April), 1834. 

Sisymbrium jpolycerdtium L. grows wild at the base of the walls 
of certain streets of Bury St. Edmunds. I have forgotten its 
origin there ; but I think that it emanated from the garden of 
the late Sir Thomas G. Cullum, Bart. The streets in which 
I have seen most of it are, Northgate Street, Garland Street, 
Short Brackland, &c. ; but the cleaning efforts of the sur- 
veyor's men do not allow so many plants as could be wished 
to bear seeds. — J. Z). 

Drosera rotundifolia L. occasionally exhibits its Flowers in an 
expanded State. (VI. 469.) — Drosera rotundifolia must, un- 
questionably, be considered a shy and capricious plant as 
regards the expansion of its blossoms ; and we have yet to 
learn the laws by which its motions in this respect are regu- 
lated. That they do not depend solely on the presence or 
absence of sunshine is quite clear ; for, though I have known 
the plant from my early boyhood, I am not quite certain that 
I ever saw its blossoms fairly expanded till this summer. 
Botanising, the 27th of July last, on the shores of Coleshill 
Pool, where the Drosera grows in great profusion, I was sur- 
prised and delighted at beholding the flowers on every plant 
fully and beautifully expanded. The day was warm and bright, 
but the sunshine at intervals interrupted by passing clouds : 
the hour of the day, I think, must have been from a little 
before twelve to one. In the preceding summer, about 
July 24. to 26., I happened to have paid two visits to the 
same spot, when the weather was equally fine and bright; 
and on both these occasions gathered many specimens of 
Drosera, but not a single one was to be found with its flowers

expanded. When this lovely little plant fairly unfolds its 
charms, its dewy leaves glistening in the sun, it may truly be 
regarded as one of the brightest gems of Flora. Your cor- 
respondent, Mr. Brown, appears duly to appreciate its " love- 
liness." (VI. 469.) May I be allowed to add, that I should have 
much pleasure in shaking that gentleman by the hand, and, 
did circumstances permit, in accompanying him to the native 
marshes of Scheuchzer/a palustris, Carex helionastes, and 
other rarities. Yours, &c. — W. T. Bree. Allesley Rectory,

The Sap of the Sycamore {K^cer PseudO'Vldtanus L.) is sweet. 
(V. 346.) — I used, when a boy, to cut notches in the syca-

grew in two clumps, nine in one, seven in the other), and 
sip the sap as it dropped from the wounds. — John Howden.

Affinities between Plants arid subjacent Rocks. (VI. 335. 424.) 
— Neither the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.) nor the bil- 
berry [Faccinium MyrtlUus Z/.] ever, I believe, grow upon 
limestone. The hills of limestone and gritstone in this neigh- 
bourhood are of nearly the same altitude, and dip into each 
other in a most singular manner. We have also large tracts 
of uncultivated land, both of limestone and gritstone. Now, 
the Digitalis grows so abundantly on the gritstone, from the 
summit of the hills to the bottom, that I have, for yeiirs, been 
in the habit of noticing that the different substrata may be 
determined by the presence or absence of this plant; for I 
have never seen a single plant on limestone, even where it has 
grown abundantly, within a ^Qvf hundred yards, upon the 
sandstone. — W. Cautrell, Wirksworth, Derbyshire, Sept, 26.

GEOLOGy. — For Lacustrine Formations, amorig the Tertiary 
Beds of this Part of the Country, but little search has been 
hitherto made ; although there is every reason to believe that 
they exist in several parts of Essex. Mr. Edward Charlesworth 
of Ipswich lately pointed out to me a very interesting section of 
one of these formations at Stutton, by the side of the river Stour, 
about six miles south of Ipswich. It consists of a tenacious 
grey-coloured clay in one part, and a greenish sand in another, 
extending along the margin of the Stour to the distance of 
about 100 yards. The tide, at high water, reaches the foot of 
the cliff, which it occasionally undermines ; and it appears to 
have made great encroachment upon the land, from the extent 
of ooze in that part of the river. Some of the shells are 
coloured by the red oxide of iron ; and the clay, in patches, 
has a ferruginous appearance. It appears a locality that 
would well reward an elaborate research. I have paid it but

The shell may be thus characterised : — Testa ovato-trigona,

tribus in utraque valva, dentibus lateralibus magnis serratis. 
It approaches near to C trigona of Deshayes, Paris Foss. 
pi. 19. fig. 16, 17.; from which, however, it is easily distin- 
guished, by its being nearly equilateral and subimbricated. 
The generality of the specimens are much eroded externally ; 
but one or two which I have distinctly show the depressed 
imbrications. 

All the other species of shells I have been able to identify 
with recent analogues ; the ITnio and Anodonta are scarcely 
perfect enough to decide upon. I have received a few spe- 
cimens of the Valvata piscinalis, from a freshwater formation 
at Copford, about five miles west of Colchester. But this is 
a spot I have not yet visited : perhaps some correspondent in 
that neighbourhood may make us better acquainted with its 
contents. — S, V. Wood. WoodbridgCf March 27. 1834.

MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE. 



Art. I. Retrospective Criticism, 

The Vulture's Nose, [p. 165 — 169.] — The American phi- 
losophers have signed a solemn certificate that they feel 
assured that the two species of vultures which inhabit the 
United States " are guided to their food altogether through 
their sense of sight, and not that of smell " [p. 169.] : I, on 
the contrary [V. 233—241., VI. 163 — 171.], that all vultures 
can find their food through the medium of their olfactory 
nerves, though it be imperceptible to their eye. 

I cannot consent to deprive the vultures of their noses 
merely on the strength of experiments which, from circum- 
stances, may prove fallacious, notwithstanding every possible 
precaution ; and, in the cases before us, I find myself con- 
strained to dispute the legitimacy of the deductions at which 
these gentlemen calculate they have arrived. The effluvium 
from the dead hare and the offal which they had procured 
might have been prevented from ascending by the covering of 
brushwood ; or it might have been depressed to the earth by 
humidity, or by a current of wind. Either of these sug- 
gestions may be adopted in the present instance, because the 
dogs, which had no tainted footsteps to guide them, still 
found that which insured their discovery of the carrion. 

The sad experiment of putting out the poor vulture's eyes 
fills me with distressing emotions. The supposed fact of the 
tortured captive not smelling his favourite food, when placed 
within a7i inch of his nostrils, forces us to conclude, either 
that Nature had not intended that his beautifully developed 
organs of scent should be of the least service to him, or that 
the intensity of pain totally incapacitated the lone prisoner 
from touching food. I am of the latter opinion. Un- 
questionably the pain caused by the dreadful operation ren- 
dered the miserable sufferer indifferent to all kind of 
sustenance. I myself have been unable to eat when in the 
gripes; and I once knew an old owl which died of sheer 
want, rather than swallow any thing in captivity. What 
would the American philosophers think of me, had I got this 
owl's demise well authenticated by the signatures of divers 
scientific men, and then despatched it across the Atlantic, in 
order to prove that owls do not secure their prey by means 



Betrospective Criticism, 277 

of their feet, because, forsooth, the incarcerated owl in ques- 
tion never once struck her talons into the food which had 
been placed within an inch of them. 

Nothing can show more forcibly the utter fallacy of the 
American experiments, than the attack of the vultures on the 
coarse painting which represented a " sheep skinned and cut 
up." Till I had read the account of it, I had always imagined 
that the vulture had a remarkably keen and penetrating eye. 
I must now alter my opinion. If the American gentlemen 
do not mind what they are about, they will ultimately prove 
too much (" quod nimium probat, nihil probat " [who proves 
too much, proves nothing]), and at last compel us English- 
men to conclude that the vultures of the United States can 
neither see nor smell. They assure us that these birds are 
not guided to their food by their scent, but by their sight 
alone ; and then, to give us a clear idea how defective that 
sight is, they show us that their vultures cannot distinguish 
the coarsely painted carcass of a sheep on canvass from that 
of a real sheep. They " commenced tugging at the paint- 
ing," and " seemed much disappointed and surprised " that 
they had mistaken canvass for mutton. Sad blunder ! Piti- 
able, indeed, is the lot of the American vulture ! His nose 
is declared useless in procuring food, at the same time that 
his eyesight is proved to be lamentably defective. Unless 
something be done for him, 't is ten to one but that he '11 
come to the parish at last, pellis et ossa, a bag of bones. 

The American philosophers having fully established the 
fact, that their vultures are prone to mistake a piece of 
coarsely painted canvass for the carcass of a real sheep 
" skinned and cut up," I am now quite prepared to receive 
accounts from Charleston of vultures attacking every shoul- 
der-of-mutton sign in the streets, or attempting to gobble 
down the painted sausages over the shop doors, or tugging 
with might and main at the dim and faded eyes in some 
decaying portrait of the immortal Doctor Franklin. 

The absurdity of all this must be evident to every body. 
1, in my turn, hope to prove satisfactorily, by infer-encc, 
that which the American philosophers have failed to demon- 
strate by EXPERIMENTS. I State that effluvium from putrid 
matter, being lighter than common air, necessarily ascends in 
the atmosphere, unless artificially impeded (as probably was 
the case in the first experiment of the American philosophers), 
or prevented from mounting by superincumbent humidity. 
Now, the organ of scent, which is strongly developed in the 
vulture, coming in contact with this effluvium, when it is 
allowed to float in the atmosphere, enables the bird to trace 

T 3 



278 Retrospective Criticism, 

the carrion down to its source. Hence I infer that vultures 
can find their food through the medium of their olfactory 
nerves : and, this being the case, I am of opinion that there 
ought to be no great mystery attached to the act of the 
vulture's finding putrid bodies, when those bodies are out of 
sight, either on account of distance, or of interfering objects. 

When the American philosophers shall have proved to 
me, that effluvium from putrid substances does not ascend in 
the air, and that the organisation of the vulture's nose is im- 
perfect, then I will consider myself vanquished ; " efficaci do 
manus scientiae." After those gentlemen shall have accom- 
plished this, should their vultures pine in famine, by con- 
tinuing to mistake canvass for carcass, why, rot 'em, they 
may die, for aught I care to the contrary. — Charles Waterton. 
Walton Hall, March 6. 1834. 

AuduhorHs Claim to the Authorship of the Biography of 
Birds, [p. 171.] — I feel myself imperatively called upon by 
the statement which the Rev. Mr. Bachman has given us of 
" the purity, vigour, and originality " of Audubon's style of 
writing the English language, to bring into one view the 
contradictory testimonies cf many pens. Young Audubon 
tells us [in VI. 369.] that he has " the authority of a gentle- 
man," whom we cannot mistake, I mean Mr. Swainson, to state 
that it is " his firm conviction" that Audubon is the " bond 
fide author " of the Biography. Swainson himself declares 
[p. 550.] that he has " read Mr. Audubon's original manu- 
scripts," and that " the English " is as good as the English 
of the Wanderings, Audubon himself informs us that a 
friend aided him " in smoothing down the asperities of his 
ornithological biographies." The Rev. Mr. Bachman does 
not " hesitate to state that Audubon is the author of the 
book." R. B., after telling us that Audubon, at the age of 
seventeen, " could not speak the English language," remarks 
that " it cannot, therefore, be the least disparagement to 
Mr. Audubon, if, when he had a valuable work to publish 
in English, he should wish to receive the assistance and 
correction of a native." He adds that " Mrs. Audubon 
is well qualified to correct her husband's manuscripts." I 
know that Audubon was engaged, before his marriage, to 
teach French in St. Francisville; and, for a small consider- 
ation, he undertook to teach the elements of drawing in 
Philadelphia. Audubon states, in his introductory address, 
that, " for a period of nearly twenty years, his life was a 
succession of vicissitudes," and that he " tried various 
branches of commerce, but they all proved unprofitable." 
Professor Jameson informs us that Mr. Audubon " devoted 



Betrospecihe Criticism, 279 

twenty-two years of his life to the study of the natural history 
of the birds of North America. During the greater part of 
that long period, he lived principally, and nearly alone, in 
the woods." Audubon tells us, in his introductory address, 
that he left the village of Henderson, where he had " resided 
for several years." He also tells us of his " residence at 
Louisville," where he had a " partner " in business, and " a 
counting-room." On returning to Louisville, he remarks 
that his thoughts were, " for once, at least, in the course of 
his life, entirely engaged in commercial speculation." In p. 58. 
of the Biography he says, " We were on a trading voyage as- 
cending the Upper Mississippi;'' where, by the by, he shot 
his bird of Washington, which is considered no other bird 
than the bald-headed eagle. In another place, we are informed 
that " years were spent away from his family, with no other 
object in view than simply to enjoy the sight of nature." We 
know, from Audubon himself, that he had abandoned all 
commercial pursuits at the time that he first fell in with 
Charles Bonaparte, which is now about ten years ago. Pray, 
how old is Mr. Audubon ? Powers of genius ! amid such 
avocations of shop and wood, where did this Frenchman gain 
his surprising knowledge of our language? I respectfully 
request the Rev. Mr. Bachman to pay attention to the testi- 
monies here advanced. 

Audubo7i and his Ornithology, [p. 174.] — The account 
which the Rev. Mr. Bachman gives of the recent ornitho- 
logical labours of Mr. Audubon is quite uninteresting to me, 
because I can put no trust in what Mr. Audubon published 
on natural history, prior to his departure from this country. 
Charles Bonaparte, with whom Audubon had " accidentally 
formed an acquaintance" (see his introductory address), peti- 
tioned the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia that 
Audubon might be admitted a member. The necessary 
measures were adopted, and Audubon was blackballed. I 
am aware that he has since been elected : but thereby hangs 
a tale. Will the reverend eulogist have the goodness to 
enquire, why that respectable and learned society of gentle- 
men deemed it incumbent upon them to refuse the application 
of Charles Bonaparte ? 

I here beg to draw the attention of the reverend gentle- 
man to the two following extracts. The first is from Au- 
dubon's Biography of Birds ; the second from Ord's Life (f 
Wilsofi, 

" I rose, took down a large portfolio, laid it on the table, 
and showed him (Wilson), as I would show you, kind 
reader, or any other person fond of such subjects, the whole 

T 4 



280 Retrospective Criticism, 

of its contents." Again : " Mr. Wilson asked if I should 
have any objections to lending him a few (drawings) during 
his stay ; to which I replied, that I had none. He then 
bade me good morning, not, however, until I had made an 
arrangement to explore the woods in the vicinity along with 
him, and had promised to procure for him some birds, of 
which I had drawings in my collection, but which he had 
never seen." This, indeed, was truly polite and friendly on 
the part of Mr. Audubon. Again : " I presented him to my 
wife and friends, and, seeing that he was all enthusiasm, 
exerted myself as much as was in my power to procure for 
him the specimens which he wanted. We hunted together, 
and obtained birds" (mind, reader!) " which he had never 
before seen." 

Now for Wilson. I myself have seen, in Alexander Wil- 
son's own handwriting, the following extracts: — "March 17. 
Groped my way to Louisville, and put up at the Indian 
Queen tavern." — "March 19. Rambled round the town 

with my gun. Examined Mr. 's drawings in crayons. 

Very good. Saw two new birds he had. Both Motacillce.'^ 
— " March 20. Set out this afternoon with the gun. Killed 
nothing new. People in taverns here devour their meals. 
Many shopkeepers board in taverns ; also boatmen, land 
speculators, merchants, &c. No naturalist to keep me com- 
panyP Mr. and Mrs. Audubon and family boarded at this 
tavern. " March 21. Went out this afternoon, shooting, 
with Mr. A. Saw a number of sandhill cranes. Pigeons 
numerous." — " March 23. Packed up my things." — "I 
bade adieu to Louisville, to which place I had four letters of 
recommendation, and vvas taught to expect much of every 
thing there; but neither received one act of civility from those 
to whom I was recommended, one subscriber, nor one new 
bird; although I delivered my letters, ransacked the woods 
repeatedly, and visited all the characters" (mind this, reader !) 
" likely to subscribe. Science or literature has not one friend 
in this place. Every one is so intent on making money, that 
they can talk of nothing else ; and they absolutely devour 
their meals, that they may return sooner to their business. 
Their manners correspond with their features." 

Here we have two statements as opposite " as the anti- 
podes are to us, or as the south to the septentrion." In 
which of these two statements are we to put faith ? 

In Ord's beautiful Life of Alexajider Wilson, I follow the 
poor Scottish wanderer across the Atlantic wave ; I peruse, 
with deep interest, his many letters to his friends ; I grieve 
with him in his sorrows and disappointments ; I bear him

company in his astonishing expeditions ; and am enraptured 
with his unrivalled Ornithology. In it I find no contra- 
dictions to distract me ; no extravagances to astound me ; no 
statements to awaken my suspicion. His descriptions are 
consistent, his observations instructive, his plans heroic, and 
his exertions unequalled. I admire him in life, and mourn, 
with unfeigned sorrow, over his untimely end- 
In looking into Audubon's writings, I fully agree in Dr. 
Jones's opinion [VI. 550.] of the account of the rattlesnake 
swallowing a large grey squirrel, tail foremost; I condemn the 
narrative of the passenger pigeon ; I find Audubon's account 
of himself at variance with itself, and at variance with the 
account which his friends give of him ; and I pronounce his 
Biography of Birds to contain errors which any moderate 
ornithologist may easily detect. — Charles Waterton, 

The Passenger Pigeon, — " Towards the approach of day, 
the noise in some measure subsided ; long before objects were 
distinguishable, the pigeons began to move off in a direction 
quite different from that in which they had arrived the evening 
before; and, at sunrise, all that were able to fly had disap- 
peared. The bowlings of the wolves now reached our ears, 
and the foxes, lynxes, cougars, bears, raccoons, opossums 
and polecats were seen sneaking off." [Biography of Birds, 
by Audubon, p. 325.) 

" Variarum monstra ferarum ! " Virgil. 

A prodigious variety of wild beasts. 

Mr. Audubon may boast of a sight never before seen by 
mortal eyes under similar circumstances. Great indeed must 
have been the yearning for pigeon flesh, to have caused such 
a variety of wild animals to assemble there ; and irresistible 
the flavour which induced them to tarry so long beyond their 
wonted time of prowling. Their very nature seems to have 
been changed. Their remaining at the pigeon-slaughter till 
the time of sunrise is a most wonderful circumstance, which 
demands investigation on the part of naturalists; for, hitherto, 
all these wild beasts which Mr. Audubon has introduced into 
his description have only been known as animals of nocturnal 
movements, and of very skulking and suspecting habits. In 
general, the flash of a gun, the crackling of a flame, or the 
shout of a huntsman, will scare any one of them, even when 
concealed in the lonely retreat; but, on this ever-memor- 
able occasion, the nerves of the animals, both large and small, 
were strung up to an astonishing degree of intensity. The 
day had already dawned unheeded by them ; and it was only 
at sunrise that they seemed aware of being in dangerous com- 
pany, and found that it was high time to sneak ofl' from a 



2 8 Si Retrospective Criticism, 

place where, Mr. Audubon tells us, " there was little under- 
wood ;" where " the uproar continued the whole of the night;" 
where men had assembled "with iron pots containing sulphur;" 
and " with torches of pine-knots, with poles and with guns ;" 
where " fires were lighted, and a magnificent as well as won- 
derful and almost terrifying sight presented itself;" where, in 
fine, the auditory faculties of Mr. Audubon himself became so 
completely useless, on account of the stunning noise, that, 
absolutely, he was "only aware of the firing by seeing the 
shooters reloading." " O judgment ! thou art fled to brutish 
beasts, and men have lost their reason," if they can bring 
themselves to believe that into this sulphureous, torch-lighted, 
detonating, yelling, roaring, and terrific attack on the pas- 
senger pigeons, there came up a motley herd of wolves, foxes, 
cougars, lynxes, bears, raccoons, opossums, and polecats, to 
share the plunder, and actually tarried there till the rising of 
the sun ;" at which time, Mr. Audubon informs us, they were 
seen sneaking off. He himself saw what he relates. 

But let us pass on. " The pigeons," continues Mr. Audu- 
bon, " arriving by thousands, alighted everywhere, one above 
another, until solid masses as large as hogsheads were formed 
on the branches all around." Solid masses ! Our European 
pigeons, in a similar situation, would have been all smothered 
in less than three minutes. Mr. Audubon informs us, towards 
the end of his narrative, that the feathers of this pigeon "fall 
off at the least touch." From this, we may infer to a cer- 
tainty that every pigeon which was unlucky enough to be 
undermost in the solid masses would lose every feather from 
its uppermost parts, through the pressure of the feet of those 
above it. Now, I would fain believe that instinct taught these 
pigeons to resort to a certain part of the forest, solely for the 
purpose of repose, and not to undergo a process of inevitable 
suffocation ; and, at the same time, to have their backs de- 
prived of every feather, while they were voluntarily submitting 
to this self-inflicted method of ending their days. 

" Many trees," says Mr. Audubon, " two feet in diameter, 
I observed, were broken off at no great distance from the 
ground ; and the branches of many of the largest and tallest 
had given way, as if the forest had been swept by a tornado. 
Every thing proved to me that the number of birds resorting 
to this part of the forest must be immense beyond conception." 
I know that the force of a tornado will break the trunk of a 
tree two feet in diameter, because its force acts horizontally 
against the upright stem ; but how is it possible that a multitude 
of pigeons, alighting upon a tree, could cause its upright bole, 
two feet in diameter, to break off at no great distance from 



Retrospective Criticism. 283 

the ground ? The branches of the tree, which took their lead 
diagonally from the bole, might possibly have given way under 
a heavy pressure, because they were inclined more or less 
from their perpendicular; but the upright bole itself would 
stand uninjured, and defy for ever any weight that could be 
brought to bear upon it from above. 

I now leave the assemblage of wild beasts, the solid masses 
of pigeons as large as hogsheads, and the broken trunk of the 
tree two feet in diameter, to the consideration of those British 
naturalists who have volunteered to support a foreigner in his 
exertions to teach Mr. Bull ornithology in the nineteenth 
century. 

The passages upon which I have just commented form part 
of " the facts" on which R. B., in Vol. VI. of this Magazine, 
[p. 371.] tells us that the value of Mr. Audubon's Biography 
of Birds solely rests. No wonder that, ruit alto a culmine. 
By the way, I observe, at the end of that Biography, a most 
laudatory notice by Mr. Swainson. He tells us that Audubon 
contemplated Nature as she really is, not as she is represented 
in books ; he sought her in her sanctuaries. Well, be it so ; 
I do not dispute his word : still I suspect, that, during the 
search and contemplation, either the dame herself was in 
liquor, or her wooer in hallucination. — Charles Waterton,

The British Species of Eel, their Mode of Propagation (V. 
313. 744. )j and their Habits. — In the just-published Second 
Series of Jesse's Gleanings in Natural History, Mr. Yarrell, 
Dr. William Roots, and Mr. Jesse have supplied thirty-eight 
pages of information on the economy of eels. Mr. Yarrell 
has there given a synopsis of all that had been, and now is, 
known on this subject, and into this synopsis has digested the 
result of all the facts which the research of Dr. Roots, of 
Mr. Jesse, and of himself has acquired ; and he has referred 
with commendation to the discoveries of Mr. Couch registered 
in our V. 313., and to those of W. B. in V. 744. This trea- 
tise on the economy of eels is, therefore, the most perfect one 
which has appeared. 

The Goldfish with a double Tail Fin, (159.) — Dr. Han-

that, as the bones composing the rays are, in this, as in other 
fishes, double, the lusus of a double fin may arise from some 
casual defect of the cohesive substance and investing mem- 
brane of the rays, whence it may be that the bones probably 
diverge, and constitute the double fin. — James TennelL

spirit-stirring must proceed from the last two faculties of 
mind : but, perhaps, in no branch of human knowledge is there 
more need that they be strongly reined than in natural his-

he therein has not reined them sufficiently. A profound

We are very glad to see this work. It is, or at least we 
presume that it is, a clear indication of the latest state of the 
knowledge of animalcules which has been attained in Britain. 
There are six plates crowded with figures of these creatures, 
whose forms are very varied, and those of some of them are 
very extraordinary. The exhibited species, and many more 
besides, are described generically and specifically, and " in 
good set terms," in the text of the book ; where their system- 
atic affinities, correlations of structure, &c., are treated of. 
The classifications followed in the general arrangement are 
derived from those by MUller and Ehrenberg. The last- 
named author's arrangement of the Phytozoa is given, dis- 
tinctly, towards the end of the book ; and to it are appended 
some remarks by Mr. Pritchard, who observes, at the close, 
that, " In a supplementary treatise, it is purposed to give a 
more enlarged systematic arrangement of the Phytozoa, ac- 
cording to their organisation, together with the result of such 
further observations as the author shall make or be favoured 
with." A plate, exhibiting Pritchard's achromatic micro-

Details. Svo, 96 pages, with several woodcuts, Dublin, 
Curry and Co. 1834. 

To many English readers it may be necessary to state that 
Ballybunian is so named from an old castle on the coast of the 
county of Kerry, north of the junction of the river Cashin 
with the embouchure of the Shannon. 

Our information respecting the geology and mineralogy of 
Ireland has remained so defective, that we gladly hail any 
endeavours to make us better acquainted with particular parts 



Ainsworth's CaiiS% of Ballybuniaiu 287 

of that island ; and we should have been much pleased to 
find, in the present volume, such a clear description of the 
district in which the caves are situated, as might be intelli- 
gible to the general reader ; and the scientific details in ac- 
cordance with the present state of geology. That our author 
has failed in these respects is, we think, rather owing to the 
want of proper arrangement, than of ability. There appears 
a desire of display, by a parade of new names, " to amaze 
the unlearned, and make the learned stare ;" while the ex- 
ploded terms " geognosy," and " geognostic," are still re- 
tained, and the reader left in doubt whether he is among 
strata equivalent to the lias and alum slate of England, or to 
slates and limestones of the transition series, or whether the 
older and newer strata are here in juxtaposition. Only one 
fossil is named to elucidate the subject. From the form in 
which the book is published, and the woodcuts that accom- 
pany it, the author evidently intended the work to be popular. 
To have insured this, the physical structure and scenery 
should have been under one head ; the geology under another ; 
and the mineralogy and natural history under a third : in 
place of which arrangement, the parts are so intermixed as 
to prevent the reader from obtaining a clear connected notion 
either of the parts or of the whole. 

The caves of Ballybunian are excavations in the cliffs, 
formed by the action of water impelled by winds and tides 
into fissures, or excavating softer portions of strata in the 
cliffs. These caves, arches, and excavations are not of great 
magnitude, when compared with those in Scotland and the 
Hebrides, but they present many grotesque forms, and are 
well represented in the woodcuts in the present small volume. 
From the nearly horizontal form of the stratification, as re- 
presented in the cuts, and the description of the alum slate, 
and from its spontaneous combustion, we should rather have 
inferred that the strata belong to the lias group, than to the 
soft slates of the transition series ; but the mineral characters 
of the limestones identify them with the mountain limestone 
so extensively spread over many of the Irish counties. The 
principal metallic substances are iron pyrites and copper 
pyrites. The latter mineral is, however, so much intermixed 
with extraneous matter as to offer little prospect of its being 
advantageously worked. Our author says that " the rich- 
ness of the ore at Ballybunian, the abundance of the veins, 
and the facilities of working them, from their geognostic 
position and association, do not hold out any sanguine hopes 
of their ever being turned to very lucrative purposes." From 
the former part of this sentence, the reader would have in-

ferred a different conclusion ; the author evidently means from 
the poorness of the ore, and the xsoaiit of facilities of working 
the veins ; the sentence would then be intelligible to English 
readers. 

We have given a fuller account of this small volume, and 
offered our remarks more freely, than we should have done, 
had not the author informed us that he is engaged in more 
important researches on the mineralogy of Ireland. Should 
he publish the result of his labours, we hope he will not, as 
in the present volume, disguise every well-known mineral 
under the pedantic names given to them by some Continental 
mineralogists. This absurd jargon is justly falling into con- 
tempt among the best informed geologists and mineralogists 
of South Britain. The writer who would be a successful 
author, in any science, should recollect that his object ought 
not to be to make a parade of his own learning, but to con- 
vey information in a form which shall be the most generally 
intelligiblco

JMeteoric phenomena have been exhibited, during the last 
few years, on a scale of unusual magnitude, and more fre- 
quently than at many previous epochs. We will endeavour, 
in the present Number, to exhibit some prominent examples, 
and to trace their connection with corresponding derange- 
ments of the earth ; illustrating their occurrences by reference 
to more ancient events of similar complexion and character, 
and in conjunction, at the same time, with the other subjects 
which these papers [VI. 289., VII. 193.] profess to discuss. 

The most extraordinary instance, perhaps, on record is 
that given in Silliman's American Journal of Science and Arts, 
XXV. 354 — 411. From the statements there published, of 
more than fifty credible observers, it appears that the whole 
of that part of the United States which is comprehended 
between the latitudes of 23° and 43° n., and the longitudes 
of 61° and 94° w., was visited by a most extraordinary dis- 
play of falling and shooting stars, for nine hours (from 9 p.m. 
to daylight), on the night of November 12-13. 1833. The 
phenomenon was also visible to the passengers on board the 
Hilah from Liverpool, then on St. George's Bank, 300 miles 
from the coast, (p. 388.) It is impossible to compress into 
a reasonable bulk analyses of the separate accounts : I shall,

290 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena^ 

therefore, merely give the general description as collected 
from them all, the parallel cases, and the accompanying 
phenomena. 

Nothing will express the remarkable appearance displayed, 
so well as comparing it to the most brilliant exhibition of 
rockets and fireworks. One observer calculates {Amer. Jour,^ 
p. 389.) that at least 207,840 meteors were seen at Boston ! 
They varied in size from that of the full moon (p. 379.) to 
that of a teacup (p. 384.), and even a point (p. 389.). Some of 
them were followed by a train of pale or bluish and reddish 
light, which, in one particular case, seemed acted upon by 
the wind. Phosphoric lines also marked the display. In 
some cases an explosion was heard * ; and a gelatinous sub- 
stance was found, in three instances, where balls had struck 
the earth, (p. 396.) The height of these phenomena varied 
from a short distance from the surface of the earth to a con- 
siderable elevation (as calculated by the editor) above the 
atmosphere : in one case, clouds obscured the cause, though 
the light was seen through. But the immense arcs traversed, 
the parallaxes, and the perspective, proved that the height 
must have been immense, where they first appeared; though, 
in descending through the atmosphere, they exploded, in 
some few instances, within 10 ft. of the earth ; and, in others, 
struck it. 

The weather, it seems, throughout the whole extent of the 
region visited, was suddenly changed, immediately before the 
display, from 'warm to coZ^, accompanied by extraordinary trans- 
parenc}^ of the atmosphere. Calmness and frosts succeeded to 
storms and intense heat. (p. 386.) The wind had changed from 
S.E. to N.W., and, during the display, to n.e. ; upon which 
the meteors increased in brightness and number, (p. 384.) 
The direction was generally to the west ; but they appeared, 
to different observers, differently directed. " They fell," says 
one, " in every direction, 7'esemhling a Jail of snoxv.^^ (p. 394.) 
The air was excessively electric during the display : clothes, 
hair, &c., were visibly affected. The declination of the needle 
is also, on good authority, supposed to have been increased. 
(p. 397.) The aurora borealis preceded, accompanied, and 
succeeded the meteors, as seen in different localities, (p. 397.) 
All the observers seem to agree in one fact, that the radiant 

* One observer, Mr. Palmer (Newhaven), mentions a peculiar odour, 
which was compared by the whole company to a smell o{ sulphur or onions. 
(p. 384.) Mr. Trevelyan states, that, during the display of the aurora in 
the Island of Faroe, he has observed the peculiar odour present during 
electrical discharges from the earth. (Encj/c. Brit., viii. 623., 7th ed.) 
This, again, serves to connect these phenomena.

point was in the constellation of Leo ; and that it agreed 
exactly with the point to which the magnetic " needle woidd 
point when left free to move both vertically and horizontally J^ 
(p. 356.) * From this and other circumstances, it is concluded 
that this phenomenon was of similar character to that of the 
aurora borealis. f The " concurrent phenomena " are, the sink- 
ing down of an acre and a half of wood at Hudson, New 
York, full 30 ft. below the surface ; the occurrence of a 
trembling of the earth, previously observed there, at Lynch- 
burg; a fall of rain, on Nov. 13., A.M., at Harvard, when not 
a cloud was to be seen [and a luminous appearance, like the 
zodiacal light, on Dec, 3., at Newhaven] ; and terrible gales 
of wind, on Nov. 13., between lat. 40° and 50°, and long. 30° 
and 50° W. 

These are the principal particulars of the statements in 
Silliman's JournaL The authors mention, that it is their 
intention to consider, in a future number, previous examples 
of like phenomena ; and to collect farther information, from 
distant parts of the west, before coming to any distinct con- 
clusion. They dwell, however, on the fact of the appearances 
corresponding with the aurora, and on the light seen in the 
west on Dec. 3. ; which, they state, was again visible on 
Dec. 29.t 

A similar phenomenon is also quoted (that of Nov. 12. 
1799), seen by Humboldt and Bonpland, in Cumana; the 
particulars of which agree in all respects with those above 
mentioned. This was ascertained to have been observed 
through 60° of latitude and 91° of longitude (p. 369.); and 
the wind, as in 1833, changed its direction, and the weather 
became suddenly cold, a well-known condition of the aurora, 
(p. 360.) § It is also mentioned, that a similar occurrence 
took place about eighty years since ; when so many falling

stars appeared over the volcano of Gayambo, in Quito, that that 
mountain was supposed to be in flames, (p. 368.) The great 
earthquake of Cumana, in 1766, was also preceded by similar 
phenomena, (p. 368.) 

Thus far I have followed the American Journal; nor can we 
dispute the apparent resemblance to the aurora which these 
meteors assumed. There are some facts which would still 
more strengthen that idea. The light spoken of on Dec. 3. 
1833, and again on Dec. 29., was, perhaps, the aurora itself, 
as that meteor was seen here on the latter day. On Nov. 13., 
at 4 morning, during the display of meteors in America, 
occurred an earthquake at Chichester in Sussex.* Vesuvius 
was in eruption on the 24<th; and, a short time before the 13th 
(the date I do not exactly know), Arica and Tecno, in South 
America, had been destroyed by an earthquake of great 
intensity. These facts, taken in connection with the stated 
sinking and trembling of the earth, and with the fall of rain at 
Harvard, may, perhaps, be allowed to bear considerably on 
the point at issue. I would also add, that, with reference 
to the meteors of Nov. 12. 1799, Humboldt has stated (ii. 
512.) that the sky at Cumana was covered, from Oct. 10. 
to Nov. 3., with a reddish vapour, through which the stars 
shone. The heat was excessive before the meteors, though 
the thermometer was not higher than 26°. The usual breeze 
did not spring up, the air burnt, the earth cracked ; on Nov. 4., 

* I add here a memorandum relating to this earthquake, which may be 
of use elsewhere : — 

The 12th of November was (in this place) a very clear bright day : rain 
had fallen in the early part of the morning, but the afternoon was par- 
ticularly brilliant. About 4^ p.m., I happened to go up to Wimborne on 
the London mail. About that time, I observed a fog, of singular character 
for the season, rapidly rising, and forming in clouds along the surface of 
the country ; and its progress was evidently from the east to the west, 
i. e. the fog rose continually later to the west : it was not a sea fog, nor 
was it in motion from any wind. It rose exactly as steam rises from linen 
held before a fire \ as I have occasionally seen mists formed among moun- 
tains, after rain, in very hot weather. By the time we reached Wimborne 
(not more than an hour), the fog was so intense that one could scarcely 
see ; and it continued so till about 8 a.m. on the 13th, when it completely 
dispersed. I observed, at the time, that it seemed as if the ground had 
been suddenly heated; and others coincided in the remark. We heard, a few 
days afterwards, that the earthquake had occurred at Chichester at 4 a.m. 
on the 13th: and I could not refrain from connecting the two occurrences, 
as a similar thick fog preceded the earthquakes at Lisbon, on June 6. 
1807, and on Feb. 1. and 2. 1816. [On Nov. 18. 1833, a thick fog extended 
all over France.] 

It may be as well to subjoin, that the earthquakes which occurred at 
Chichester, on Sept. 18. 1833, and on Jan. 23. 1834, were felt in this 
place. I have already communicated the contents of this note to the 
Chichester Philosophical Society.

thick black clouds extended to the zenith ; at 4 p.m., loud 
thunder was heard ; and, a few minutes after, in the midst of 
the loudest thunder., two shocks of earthqilalce occurred ; the 
direction of which, from north to south, was unusual for that 
country. Add to this, also, the occurrences of 1 766, and those 
of 1753 or 1754, in Quito, and a connexion is apparent 
between the meteors and the earth.* It is somewhat singular, 
that, on Nov. 14. 1832, a phenomenon of like character with 
that of 1833 was witnessed in this country. A short time 
after midnight, on that occasion, a similar display of meteors, 
resembling the most brilliant fireworks, was seen all over the 
south of England, and in many parts of the Continent ; and 
much alarm was occasioned in this neighbourhood in con- 
sequence. At that time occurred the earthquake at Bermuda, 
the eruption of Etna, and, closely afterwards, that of Vesuvius. 
(VI. 302, 303.) At Brunck, in the Tyrol, the meteors were 
preceded by the appearance of an intense light in the sky, 
which, about 6 a.m., descended from the sky, and was then 
drawn up into a globular mass ; it then expanded, and from 
it issued numerous meteoric stones. The sky was clear, 
not ruddy. {Austrian Journal.) A letter from Brunn, in 
Moravia, dated at the beginning of Jan. 1834, states that, 
just before, an extraordinary meteor was seen there. Imme- 
diately after nightfall, a very vivid streak of light was suddenly 
seen, giving the idea of houses on fire. A noise as loud as 
thunder was heard, and the heavens appeared in a blaze. A 
round body of fire was seen at Poscowitsch, Austerlitz, 
Raitz, and many other places. Gradually it attained the size 
and appearance of the moon, increasing till it was as big as a 
house : it created great alarm. Rays of light, as bright as the 
sun, came from it; so that the naked eye could not endure it. 
There were no meteoric stones seen there ; but Dr. Reichen- 
bach found some, a few days after, near Blansko. {Frenck 
Journal.) There was an earthquake in Baden about this time; 

* Hecker has recorded the occurrence of extraordinary meteors in 
many places, as at Avignon, Paris, and in the East ; where, Mezeray states, 
a globe of fire destroyed the vegetation [like that, I suppose, which, in the 
year 1737, fell on the Guaytecas Islands] : and these meteors were con- 
temporary with the frightful earthquakes and universal fogs which carried 
such terror all over Europe and the East. (Black Death y p. 35. 40.) 

During the earthquakes in Scotland, on Aug. 13. 1816, at the time of 
the shock at Dunkeld, a meteor was seen from east to west ; contrart/ to 
the shock, which was from south-west to north-east. At Aberdeen, also, 
after the second shock, a thin white vapour settled on the mountains, 
though the air was clear. 

The year 17C4 offers several grounds for conjecture respecting this con- 
nexion: its phenomena were, frequent meteors, thunder storms, inunda- 
tions, hurricanes, and earthquakes.

and, on Jan. 1., all the wells at Bienne threw out a quantity 
of silvery matter with a foaming torrent, that made the streets 
like milk. [Gazette Universetle de Suisse.) It was just the 
same during the earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755. (See Ebel, 
ii. 20.) Vesuvius was in eruption in January, also. 

It is observable, that the shocks of earthquake * in Cu- 
mana, in 1799, were coincident in direction with that of the 
meteors ; and, as a parallel case, I quote another : — While 
the coast of Chile was being elevated by earthquakes, on 
Nov. 20. 1822, meteors were observed running along in the 
same direction as the shocks, viz., from north-east to south- 
west; the preceding day (19th) being remarkable for the 
extreme rarefaction of the air. {A, R.) During the same 
month and year (on the 7th), luminous balls of fire were seen 
at Bourges, in France, of the size of the moon ; followed by 
earthquakes at Heidelberg, Stutgard, &c., from the 25th to 
the 29th. The aurora was seen, on the night of the 7th, by 
Captain Parry. [Second Voyage, p. 381.) 

That the aurora is connected with shooting stars, I had 
evidence, on the evening of Sept. 17. 1833 ; when, about the 
time that the beam of light appeared (9 p.m.) in the clear 
sky, several stars shot off from it to the southwards, con- 
tinuing in sight, and leaving a slight train, for several seconds. 
Rain followed next day from the south, with wind. On the 
same day occurred a fall of snow at Caithness, with un- 
usual cold; and, on the 18th5 an earthquake was felt at Chi- 
chester, at 10 A.M. ; the aurora and the zodiacal light being 
both visible in the evening of that day. On the 26th, Pro- 
fessor Parish observed, at Cambridge, a large meteor, tra- 

* The years 1716, 1717, and 1718 are remarkable for meteorie phe- 
nomena. In 1716, on March 6., occurred an aurora of extreme brilliance ; 
which was seen from Iceland to the east of Poland, and all over the 
north of Europe, from 50° lat. {Gall. Nature^ iv. 394.) j and, at that 
time, Grimvatn in Iceland broke out into eruption {So-ope, p. 248.). On 
Aug. 18. 1716, meteors were seen all over Europe, from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
On Jan. 4. 1717, there was a shower of fire at Quesnoy. On March 17. 
there was an appearance of imperfect lightning ; attributed to the aurora, 
but considered of the same character as that of 1737. (VI. 296.) On 
June 6., Vesuvius erupted, and continued in activity till 1718. Eyafilla 
Yokul was also in eruption this year. On March 6. and 7. 1718, occurred 
an eruption and a tremendous earthquake at St. Vincent. The mountain, 
whence issued clouds of dust, &c., disappeared, attended by a hurricane. 
{Scrope, quoting Moreau de Jonnes, p. 163, 164., and p. 255.) On 
March 19. 1718, an extraordinary blazing meteor was seen all over Eng- 
land and France. The account of it, by Dr. Halley, in Phil. Trans., 1719, 
will bear comparison with that of the American meteors in Silliman's Jour- 
nal. El Pico was also in eruption in 1718. On April 6. 1719, a shower 
of ashes fell in the Atlantic for 18 hours, so that volcanic action was con- 
tinued.

versing the sky to the inagnetic norths as large as the moon ; 
though, in the horizon, it was no bigger than a thread. 

On July 21. 1833, also, while an aurora illuminated the 
north, I saw a brilliant meteor travelling from east to west, as 
the moon was setting. Clouds were seen in the south ; whence, 
next day, came wind and rain. 

On Feb. 20. ISS^, occurred a fourth shock of earthquake 
at Chichester, at a quarter before 2 a.m., attended by a 
rumbling noise ending in slight explosion ; and, at one hour 
after noon of the same day, the aurora borealis was seen at 
Kendal in Westmoreland. It was described, in the journal 
whence I extracted the observation, as consisting of three pale 
stripes of light, which rose from a cluster of fleecy clouds a 
io-wi degrees above the horizon, one point east of north, shoot- 
ing to the zenith, still in contact with the clouds ; one cloud in 
mid-heaven, the rest to the eastward. At 1^ p.m., a beautiful 
stream of pale light was seen, extending in width as it shot 
upwards, like a plume of feathers: its progress to the zenith 
was rapid; but, as it passed this point, it melted in ether. 
(WeUmareland Gazette.) On Aug. 18. 1783, a great meteor 
passed all over England {Phil, Tr. abd. vol. xv.) ; and, on the 
same night, Vesuvius was in eruption, as well as a volcano 
in Greenland. Another meteor appeared on Oct. 4., at 
3 A. M. ; and, again, a third on the same day, at 6 J p. m. 
(P. T. 1784.) On March 21. and 26., and April 12. and 
26., there were also great displays of the aurora borealis. 
(P. T, abd. 1790.) Now, from March 20. to 26., there were 
earthquakes at Zante, Cephalonia, and Santa Maura [probably 
including the sea]. (Lyell^ i. 414.) 

It is also well known, that there were earthquakes all over 
the globe in 1783; and, from Feb. 5. to the end of 1786, 
Calabria was shaken. The volcanoes of Iceland were also in 
action at the period of some of these meteors. Thunder 
storms were also frequent, and hurricanes. On March 17., 
a thunder storm destroyed the castle of Montaignac, in 
France ; on April 1 1., there was a hurricane at Venice ; and, 
on May 13., the city of Kremnitz in Hungary was destroyed 
by liglitning : and, on July 2., a dreadful thunder storm visited 
the whole of England; while, on Aug. 3., a similar storm 
destroyed twenty parishes in Orleans, France. 

The meteor of Aug. 18. 1783 was observed to come from 
the north ; and was actually seen by different observers, 
between the Orkney Islands and Rome, throughout its course. 
It might be debated, whether or not this meteor was gene- 
rated by electrical forces, traversing a certain line, connecting 
Vesuvius, then in action, with other volcanic agents at the 

u 4

extremities of the earth. Such a supposition might account 
for the velocity and force of attraction of these bodies ; and 
would receive encouragement from vi^hat is known of magnetic 
curves surrounding the earth, and from the researches of 
M. de Bylandt. (VII. 83—88,) 

In all probability, the great meteor which Krusenstern 
{Ueise um die Welt) saw, in Oct. 1803, in lat. 37° 40' N. and 
long. 14° 5' E., was of similar character. It took the shape 
of a fireball ; and left a luminous belt in the heavens for an 
hour, a quarter of a degree wide through its whole track ; 
it was 15° high. (Q. i2., vi. 362.) On April 26. of that 
year, a fall of aerolites took place at L'Aigle, in Norman- 
dy* ; and the celebrated hurricane at Lucknow occurred on 
May 31. On May 21. 1834, a large meteor, leaving a train, 
and exploding, passed over Hanley, in Worcestershire, at IJ 
A.M., in a clear sky, in the direction of the wind, viz., n.e. 
It travelled with great velocity, and was very high. ( WolveV' 
hampton Chronicle.) On May 18., a tremendous hail storm, 
covering eight miles by three, occurred in Tyrone : not melted 
till next day. On the 25th, a heavy gale from n.e. did great 
damage at Dublin. During March and April earthquakes 
have been universal. 

Captain Parry has stated that, on Dec. 14. 1824, he saw 
several very bright meteors, between 5 and 6 o'clock, p. m., 
" at which time the wind freshened from the n. w. by w., in 
a very remarkable manner.f On this occasion," he says, " as 
on the 12th of December, there appeared to be an evident 
connexion between the occurrence of the meteors and the 
changes of the weather at the time." [Third Voyage, p. 66») 
This is exactly confirmed by the following extract from Silli- 
man's Journal (p. 402.), where the writer says, " It is hardly 
possible to persuade ourselves that two concurrent pheno- 
mena, both as remarkable as the change of weather and the 
falling stars, were independent of each other ; but it may prove 
a difficult point to decide what was the nature of their con^ 
nexion : whether, as some have hinted, in observations already 
before the public, the meteors were occasioned by the change 

* The analysis of these aerolites, as given by Vauquelin and Fourcroy, 
is as follows {Phil. Mag.y xvi. 302.): — Silica, 54; oxide of iron, 36; 
magnesia, 9 ; oxide of nickel, 3 ; sulphur, 2 ; lirae 1 : in all, 105. 

-j- Captain Parry is borne out in this by what is related in the Acta 
Litteraria Suecice, 1734, p. 78. ; and by Chladni, in the Gothaisches Magazm, 
xi. 712.; and by Forster, who observed that a violent wind succeeded 
each fireball which he saw. And Sir W. Hamilton observed that the 
smoke from Vesuvius, in the year 1764, was uniformly increased at the 
time of " bad weather." (P. 7"., 1767.) The same freshening of the wind 
attended and increased the aurora on September 25. 1827.

of weather, in consequence of the highly electrical state ot 
the atmosphere, which frequently follows such a change ; or 
whether higher portions of the atmosphere descended, bringing 
the meteors along with them ; or whether the meteors them- 
selves, by disturbing the equilibrium of the atmosphere, caused 
air from colder regions to flow into the parts where they 
prevailed ; or, finally, whether some common and remote cause 
is to he sought for, that gave origin to both the change of weather 
and the meteors" The present undertaking may, perhaps, 
elucidate and explain this more probable solution of the diffi- 
culty. Two particulars are mentioned in Silliman's Journal^ on 
which stress is there laid, viz., the occurrence of tremendous gales 
of wind between the lat. of 40° and 50° n., at the time of the 
meteors, and the sudden change of the air from warm to cold, 
I shall illustrate the former by powerful examples of violent 
winds in the course of these researches ; but, for the present, 
shall only attempt to show that cold is a common effect of 
meteors^ and also of volcanic action. I must, however, first 
prove that the aurora is almost always succeeded by a change 
in the direction and intensity of the wind, and of the atmo- 
sphere. 

On the 12th October, 1833, a most brilliant aurora illu- 
mined the atmosphere (see Mr. Fielding's paper, VII. 50.), 
which Professor Airey has computed to have been from 50 
to 60 miles above the surface of the earth. [Camh. Phil, 
Trafis.) Mr. Fielding has registered the remarkable changes 
in the weather which followed this meteor, especially the 
sudden decrease of temperature, (VII. 51.) On the same day 
occurred a furious gale at Madeira, and all along the coast 
of British America. On the 13th and 14th we had, in Eng- 
land, a very heavy gale attended with rain. Being called up 
about 3 A.M., on the 14th, to go into Poole for a medical 
attendant, I had the opportunity of witnessing another display 
of auroral light, of a most interesting character. The moon 
was but one day old, and consequently did not shine ; 
and the sky was covered with thick masses of clouds, which 
rushed rapidly across from the s. w. to n. e. But these clouds 
(which would have occasioned pitchy darkness) were illumi- 
nated by bright flashes of light, which traversed them in the 
direction of the magnetic meridian, communicating a general 
brightness equal to that of a clouded full moon. Tiie night 
was, during this display, very warm, and a soft misty rain 
was falling; which was, however, during the darkness which 
preceded, and all the next day, extremely violent. Captain 
Parry {Third Voyage, p. 172.) mentions a similar phenomenon 
seen by him in crossing the Atlantic, and names Oct. 5. 1825, 



298 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

when, he says, " the weather was dark and gloomy, but the 
sky, at times, so brightly illuminated, almost in an instant, as 
to give quite as much light as the full moon similarly clouded," 
&c. On Oct. 15. 1833, Brighton Chain Pier was struck by light- 
ning ; and on that day, also, there fell, most unexpectedly, a 
tremendous rain in the Val di Noto, on Etna, during eighteen 
hours, occasioning such a torrent, that the river Acellaro 
destroyed several houses, bridges, palaces, &c., drowning 100 
persons.* [Sicilian Journal.) Either on the 12th or 13th 
(the date is lost) there was an earthquake at Antigua. The 
height of the aurora, on this occasion, tallies with the wide 
extent, including the localities of the gales, rain, and earth- 
quake.f 

Mr. Scoresby, in his Account of the Arctic Regions (i. 
417.)j considers the aurora, "under certain circumstances, 
as portentous," and says, " one of the most tremendous storms 
I was ever exposed to, succeeded a splendid exhibition of 
the northern lights." He has also mentioned the following 
dates of the aurora succeeded by storms, variable in proportion 
to the intensity of the meteor: viz. April 15. 1807; April 4. 
1810; March 28. 1811; April 7. 1815 ; April 8. 1818 ; April 
22. and 23. 1818. The foregoing examples are sufficient to 
connect the occurrences of the American meteors with the 

* This rain, like that at Harvard (Silliman's Joz«7i.), seems to have been 
the effect of some developement of electricity. The Italian papers call it 
unexpected. 

•\ The ancient authors who speak of the destruction of Helice and 
Bura, cities of Greece (b. c. 372 or 373), mention a column of fire ^ which 
ascended very high into the air, during the time of the earthquake at Delos 
which preceded the ruin of the cities ; but it is impossible to say whether 
this was or was not a meteoric phenomenon. (Seneca, Nat. Qiusst.y vi. 26.) 

In St. Isidore's History of the Goths^we find the following prognostics of 
the approach of Attila : — " Multa eodem tempore cceU et terrae signa 
praecesserunt, quorum prodigiis tam crudele bellum significaretur. Nam 
assidids terrcs motibus factis, a parte orientis luna fuscata est, a solis 
occasu Stellas cometes apparuit, atque ingenti magnitudine aliquandiu fulsit. 
Ab Aquilonis plaga ccclum rubens^ sicut ignis aut sanguis, effectus est, per- 
mistis perigneum ruborem linteis clarioribus in speciem hastarum rutilan- 
tium deformatis." Here we have the aurora concurrentwith the earthquakes 
in the fifth century. It is curious to observe the expression " speciem 
hastarum'''' as descriptive of the same phenomenon which Pliny alludes to 
under " armorum crepitus ; " and Gemma (a. d. 1575) under " spears and 
cities and waves, of clouds and battles." As an exception to the general 
character which the aurora bears in the minds of the uninformed, we are 
told by Malte-Brun, quoting Stein's Geography, that, in the first quarter of 
1817, 12,000 persons emigrated from Wurtemberg, and that religious ideas 
influenced a great number ; while the aurora, which appeared on Feb. 9., 
was regarded by many as a sig7i that their emigration was favoured by heaven^ 
(Liv. 141. tom. iv. p. 127., Brux. ed.) This aurora was seen in England, 
and was followed by deluges of rain.

aurora, if not with earthquakes, which certainly seem to 
correspond with appearances of both. Even the change from 
warmt/i to cold, which I will now allude to, evidences the same; 
as cold is produced by volcanic action, as well as by atmo- 
spheric phenomena. A writer in the New York Advertise?-, 
who was riding in the stage, in St. Lawrence County, New 
England, informs us that he encountered a s7iow storm during 
the exhibition of the meteors of Nov. 1833 ; and that frequent 
flashes of light were seen, which were mistaken for lightning, 
but the meteors they did not see otherwise. (Silliman's Journal, 
p. 386.) This solitary exception to the general features of 
the phenomena is very valuable : and the following facts will 
bear out the narrator. During a snow storm at Treves, on 
P'eb. 29. 1817, St. Paul's Church, in that town, was struck 
by lightning, accompanied by loud thunder. The year 1823 
was commenced with a frost of unusual intensity and duration* ; 
yet, even up to the end of Dec. 1822, the volcanic operations 
of that remarkable year were continued ; and while the frost 
lasted, and during falls of snow, an earthquake, on Jan. 30., 
shook the Island of Oeland and other places ; and these con- 
vulsions succeeded those at Aleppo, which lasted till the 13th 
of that month. In Hungary, on August 4. 1833, a globe of 
fire, as large as a carriage wheel, broke against the mountains 
with a tremendous explosion. The atmosphere immediately 
became cold, and on the 6th the Alps were covered with snow ; 
[Courier, Sept. 5. 1833) ; while, on the 11th of August, there 
was a considerable fall at Rottenberg, near Nuremberg. After 
the hurricane of Aug. 31. 1833 (of which hereafter), the 
thermometer, on Sept. 3., fell at Macon, in France, to zero, 
and snow fell on the neighbouring hills ; on the 6th, the snow 
fell fast at Mortagne, in Charente Inferieure; and, on the 
hills near Dijon, was 2 in. deep. (The snow at Caithness, 
a few days later, I have mentioned in p. 294.) Hail fell 
in England on the 28th Jan. 1834, immediately before the 
sudden change of the long prevalent and violent s. w. gales 
to the north. This, like the rains which fell so abundantly 
during the last winter, as well as the snoxi^\ in France, Ger- 
many, and Scotland, in 1833, was, no doubt, electrical. But 
volcanic action has produced similar effects. Mr Kelsall, who 
was an eye-witness of the great eruption of Etna in 1809, 
writes thus : — "At 15 minutes past 9 a. m., April 1 ., a quantity 

* The water-pipes under Cornhill, London, were found frozen, 3 ft. 
below the surface of the pavement. {A. li.) 

f Some Englishmen on Etna, in 1814, and Dr. Hooker on Ben Nevis, 
in July, 1825, were affected by electricity very sensibly, during snow storms 
without thunder. (Encj/c. Bril.y viii. 620., 7th ed.)

of dense smoke proceeded from the two rents specified above 
[in his account], which, raised to a considerable height in the 
atmosphere, before serene, was dilated, and formed a black 
cloud above 2000 paces in diameter, which presently dis- 
charged a copious shower of large hailstones upon the red-hot 
lava." The noise occasioned by the contact is described to 
have been " as violent as that from the discharge of a cannon 
of large calibre ; " and an English officer, stationed at La Sca- 
letta, 30 miles from Etna, '* compared it there to a brisk 
fire from numerous batteries." (Notes to the First Part of 
Two last Pleadings of Cicero against Verres, p. 143, 144.) 

During the eruption of Scaptaar Yokul in Iceland, in 1793, 
not only did rain fall in torrents, but also hail in showers, and 
snow in great abundance. Sir W. Hamilton informs us, " that 
during the earthquakes at Naples, on July 19. 1794, cold was 
sensibly felt, and ascribed to the electrical phenomena in 
activity. His servant, he tells us, felt an exceeding cold wind 
issue from a fissure very near the hot fwnaroli ; " but it did 
not surprise me, as before, on Mount Vesuvius, on the moun- 
tain of Somma, on Mount Etna, and in the Island of Ischia, 
I had met with, in particular spots, the like currents of ex- 
tremely cold air issuing from beneath the ancient lavas ; and, 
which, being constant to those spots, are known by the name 
of ventaroli" {Phil. Trans., 1795.) 

It is not now my intention to pursue the enquiry respecting 
cold, suddenly or permanently produced, on a large scale; 
as I intend to consider, in the next Number, together with 
hurricanes, some remarkable cases of unseasonable cold in 
certain years, with a view of showing that the terrestrial heat, 
affecting the ice of the polar regions, indirectly produces 
cold, as in the years 1816 to 1818 [see Q. R.']: but I shall 
state here, on the authority of Malte-Brun (liv. 107.)> that 
in 1797, on Feb. 4., the whole province of Quito was over- 
thrown by earthquakes, since which time, earthquakes have 
been continual, the sky is dull and heavy, the temperature 
altogether altered, and the cold excessive. 

I have now to state some other cases of meteoric phenomena 
equally interesting with those of Nov. 12. 1833. 

The year 1750 is celebrated for shocks of earthquakes 
throughout the earth. The Rev. Mr. Sedden of Warrington 
has recorded that, at the moment of the shock there (April 2.), 
he saw an infinite number of rays of light, proceeding from 
all parts of the sJcy, to one point near the zenith. The rays 
were at first yellow, afterwards blood-red, and were visible for 
twenty minutes. Dr. Doddridge of Northampton relates 
that, at 4 A. M. of Sept. SO (the day of the shock at that place), 



prevalent Disorder's^ ^c, with Volcanic Emanations, SOI 

a ball of fire was reported to have been seen ; that on the fol- 
lowing night the sky was red as blood, and on the night after 
appeared the finest aurora he ever saw. (P. 7\ vol. xlvi.) 
Several days before the shock at London (March 2.), there 
were reddish bows in the air, which took the same directioii as 
the shock, [Ibid.) The aurora also accompanied the earthquake 
of Aug. 23. at Spalding. [Ibid.) Sir W. Hamilton mentions 
that for many hours after the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1799, 
the air " was Jilted with meteors, such as are vulgarly called 
falling sta?'s : they shot generally in a horizontal direction, 
leaving a luminous trace behind them, but which quickly dis- 
appeared. The night was remarkably fine, starlight, and 
without a cloud." Ashes fell that night at Manfredonia, 100 
miles from Vesuvius, two hours after the eruption. (P. T., 1780.) 
The volcanic lightning and electrical phenomena, on that 
occasion, are mentioned as truly astonishing. Mr. Poulett 
Scrope has a similar remark respecting the eruption of 1822. 
[Considerations on Volcanoes, p. 81.) During the eruption of 
1794, it is stated that "out of these gigantic and volcanic 
clouds, besides the lightning, both during this eruption and 
that of 1779, I have, says Sir W. Hamilton, with many others, 
seen balls of fire issue, and some of a considerable magnitude, 
which, bursting in the air, produced nearly the same effect as 
that from the air-balloons in fireworks, the electric fire that 
came out having the appearance of the serpents with which 
those firework balloons are filled." (P. T,, 1795.) Sir D. 
Brewster witnessed an aurora in combination with a thunder 
storm at Belleville, Inverness-shire, on Aug. 29. 1821, 9J p.m. 
(Encyc. Brit,, viii. 623., 7th ed.) 

On July 13. 1833, occurred an earthquake at Sutton Ash- 
field, Staffordshire, and it was followed on the 14th by one of 
the most frightful thunder storms ever known there. That 
electrical phenomena are connected with earthquakes may be 
supposed from the fact that, on July 19. 1785, there happened 
a thunder storm without lightning at Coldstream, which killed 
a man and some horses ; being followed, on August 11., by a 
severe shock of earthquake. (P. T., 1787.) Count Hippo- 
lito has recorded (see Phil. Trans., vol. Ixxiii.) that, on March 
28. 1783, at the time of the earthquake in Calabria, flames 
rose from the ground, and, after the great concussion, towards 
the east a whitish flame rose, in a slanting direction, and had 
the appearance o{ electric fire. It was seen for two hours. 

Hitherto, we have not considered the case of meteoj'ites, 
but by almost all writers they are considered to have the 
same origin as meteors. The coincidences are the same 
in both cases. In 1812, on April 26., a meteor, accom- 



302 Supjmsed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

panied by a fireball, and from 2000 to 3000 meteoric stones, 
fell in Normandy. On the 27th, St. Vincent's was in erup- 
tion, and on March 26. occurred the earthquake at Caraccas. 
M. Biot says that " the direction which the meteor must have 
followed is exactly that of the magnetic meridian ; which is a 
remarkable result." (Nicholson's Journal,) 

Professor Santi of Pisa, who at that time resided at Pienza, 
related to Mrs. Starke [Information for Travellers^ 6th edit. 
p. 310. note x), that, on the 16th of June, ITQ^, just before 
the destruction of Torre del Greco, a " dark and dense cloud, 
at a great height, was seen from s. e., coming in the direction 
of Vesuvius, which is about 200 miles horizontally from 
Pienza. At this height, the cloud was heard to discharge 
noises like the sound of several batteries of cannon; it 
then burst into flames ; at which moment fell a shower of 
stones for seven or eight miles round, when the cloud gra- 
dually vanished. These stones are volcanic, being composed 
of grey lava, resembling what is found on Vesuvius ; and Pro- 
fessor Santi, who took infinite pains to investigate this pheno- 
menon, felt confident that the cloud rose from Vesuvius, 
which was at that moment disgorging fires, whose force and 
effects cannot be calculated," &c. The Earl of Bristol (Bishop 
of Derry) also wrote to Sir W. Hamilton, that on July 12. 
1794, just eighteen hours after the eruption, stones fell at 
Sienna, 250 miles off, in the midst of a violent thunder storm. 
(P. ?:, 1795.) See VI. 297. 

On August 29. 1833, the whole province of Nepal, and 
neighbouring parts of India, were desolated by continued 
shocks of earthquakes. Monghyr, Patna, Lucknow, Pur- 
neah, Katmandoo, &c., suffered dreadfully; 10,000 houses 
being overturned, and from 600 to 800 lives lost. A few days 
after, there occurred a fall of aerolites at Candahar, which 
broke in the windows, roofs, walls, &c., killing a child, and 
attended by lightning and meteors, and followed by 2ifog for 
six days.* The earth at this time was shaken throughout ; 

* It is stated, that, during the earthquake at Lisbon, in Nov. 1755, 
London, and, in fact, the greater part of England, was visited by one of 
the greatest fogs ever known. (^A. jR., 1813.) The occurrence oi fogs on 
these occasions is an additional link in my argument. M. Falda has stated 
that, on July 13. 1797, at OJ p.m., he witnessed a meteor in the south-west, 
of the form of a globe, almost as large as the moon at full ; its course 
being marked by a perpendicular streak of dazzling white light. The 
weather was hot. The thermometer varied from 18° to 20° Reaumur ; 
and, between 4 and 5 p.m., there had been a storm in the same quarter of 
the heavens. At the time of this phenomenon, the earth was overspread 
by a pale mist, through which no stars could be perceived ; and which, 
the following night, became a thick fog. {Folchamptouy iv. 461.) During

for on Aug. 13. Vesuvius was in eruption ; 23cl, there was an 
earthquake at Hulst, and on the Axel in Holland ; 27th there 
were earthquakes in Maryland, Virginia, doing great damage ; 
and besides those in India on 29th, Jamaica was also shaken 
at the end of the month. I shall adduce these hereafter, as 
the cause of the dreadful hurricanes of August in general, 
especially of that of August 30. and 31. Drought and the 
cholera attended these earthquakes as they occurred. That 
the air must have been exceedingly electrical at this time may 
be inferred from a striking fact, that on September 1., in the 
midst of a long and afterwards protracted drought at Antigua, 
rain suddenly fell for twenty-four hours in that island ; and I 
can only attribute it to the same cause which had produced 
the hurricane of the two preceding days in Europe. 

On July 19. 1816, during the storms, inundations, and 
hurricanes of that month and the next, there fell at Sternen- 
berg, near Bonn, a number of aerolites, one of which weighed 
100 lbs., others from 20 to 40 lbs. : their specific gravity was 
that of marble, and their appearance was like iron scoriae. 
The analysis 1 know not. On August 7. Vesuvius was in erup- 
tion, and on the 13th all Scotland was shaken by earthquakes. 
On February 1. and 2. there were earthquakes at Lisbon; on 
March 27. the midland parts of England were shaken. On 
September 24. there was a rare exhibition of the aurora in the 
N. w., attended by an arch of light in the east. 

A singular circumstance occurred on October 20. 1824, 
when hail, enclosing mineral stones {der viineralische kerne), 
which Chladni took for sulphur, but which were discovered to 
be a new meteorite, fell at Sterlitamanck, government of Oren- 
burg, in Russia. (See Eversmann, in Kastner's Archiv, v. 2. 
196. ; Chladni, m Poggendorf' s Aniialeri, vi. 1. 30. ; fully treated 
of in Bulletin de la Societe des Naturalistes dc Moscou for 1832, 
V. 45.*) 

At the end of March, 1832 {Moscow Ilussiati Gazette, April 
11. 1832), there fell, with snow at the same time, in the plain 
of Kirianova, 13 versts from Wolokolansk, an inflammable 
yellowish matter like snow or wool, over an extent of 80 to 100 
square rothen (600 or 700 feet), and from 1 in. to 2 in. deep.f 

fogs, the air is most electric. The air is, however, represented as par- 
ticularly clear during the occurrence of various meteors alluded to in this 
paper. 

* The same journal records that there was an earthquake at Symphcro- 
pol, on Jan. 17. (29.) 1832, at 11,i-a.m., also at Sevastopol (GO versts 
off), which did great damage. Barometer fell all day. Thermometer, 3^ 
Reaumur; winds.w.; sky covered with light clouds. (Cons. Steven, in 
Bulletin de Moscou, iv. 207.) 

t On March 14. 1813, there fell in a heavy snow storm, at 4 r.M., a 



304? Supposed Cotmectioii of Meteoric Phenomena, 

This substance was analysed by M. V. MariawieiF of Asta- 
schava, near Wolokolansk ; and it appears that the matter in 
question contains a new meteoric substance, which Dr. Her- 
mann calls uranelain ; from ouranos, heaven, and elaion, oil. 
Dr. Hermann asks how it came in the air, and suggests that it 
must be resolvable from the elements of the atmosphere, since 
it could not come from storm or electrical attraction, as there 
is none on the earth's surface. He also notices the coinci- 
dence of this phenomenon with the outbreak of the cholera at 
Paris ; " die die Cholera in der Hauptstadt Frankreichs an- 
richtete, die Aufmarksamkeit der Naturforscher in arhohten 
Grade auf Erscheinungen hinzulenken geignet sind, die auf 
Verlinderungen in dem gewohnlichen Mischangs-Verhaltnisse 
der Atmosphare deuten." {Bulletin de la Societe des Natu- 
ralist es de Moscou, v. 45.) 

An occurrence similar to that of October 20. 1824, took 
place on July 4. 1833, when a cloud from the west passed 
over Nakratchine in Tobolsk, at about 3 J p. m., discharging 
at the same time cubical aerolites and hailstones as large as a 
goose's Qgg* The windows of the village were broken, and 
vegetation destroyed. {Petershurgh Journal.) 

red powder, at Idria in Carniola, which coloured the snow for several 
hours, after which the usual tint remained ; but, a few hours afterwards, 
the powder, which was in a stratum from 1 to 2 in. thick, was obtained by 
melting the snow. This powder was extremely fine, and of a reddish 
yellow : it contained some specks like mica. Boiling water separated a 
yellow vegetable gummy matter. By calcination it became black, and lost 
0*20 of its weight; it was dissoluble by muriatic acid, and contained 
silica 0-3675, alumine 01 175, carbonate of lime 0*1750, oxide of iron 
000 125, oxide of titanium 00875, organic matter 0*2400 = 1-0000. The 
extraordinary part of this is the occurrence of titanium, a very rare metal 
at the surface of the earth. (Annales des Mines^ v. 282.) 

While writing the above, my attention was drawn to the following ex- 
tract of a letter from Rodelheim, near Frankfort, dated May 3. 1834: — " We 
had, yesterday and to-day, a most extraordinary phenomenon of nature. 
During very heavy showers of rain, which fell, yesterday from half-past 
eleven till twelve, and to-day between twelve and one o'clock, the water 
contained so great a mixture of sulphur, that, as it ran down the streets, 
it was covered with a yellow crust, and quantities of sulphur might be 
scraped olF the pavement." {St. Jameses Chron.y May 15. 1834.) 

The only solution of this is, that sulphuric fumes, from some volcano in 
action, were condensed and mingled with the steam, which probably 
ascended at the same time. Sulphur, however, is carried up frequently in 
storms, as proved by Fusinieri, ^y its deposit by lightning on a house at 
Vicenza, in 1829; as well as iron, in 1827, and 1831, at Vicenza and 
Padua. {Encyc. Brit., viii. 620, 621., 7th ed.) 

* Three days previous (July 1.), hail storms of unusual fury desolated 
the whole province of Liege, doing incalculable damage, and ruining the 
crops. {Journal de la Belgique.) See the account of the hail storm at 
Tussi, July 24. 1832 (which, by the way, was contemporaneous with 
volcanic action), in Encyc. Brit.y viii. 622., 7th ed. 



^prevalent Disorders^ <$•€., 'with Volcanic Emanations, 305 

Dr. Hermann relates that, in May, 1728, a stone fell in 
the presence of General Prince Peter GortschakofF at Tscheroy, 
between Kraiovo and Widdin, accompanied with hail and 
a furious hurricane. Dr. Hermann analysed a specimen of 
it, given him by M. A. V. Bachmetieff, which was received 
by him from the prince. The result was, that it was found 
to contain sulphate of liine^ with traces of common salt, \soater, 
and an inflammable substance ; consequently it was muriacite 
or anhydrite.* Hermann says it was surprising to see a by no 
means common mineral as anhydrite, fall from the air at 
Widdin, the nearest locality of that mineral being at the salt 
mines of Wieliczka in Poland. The storm, therefore, he 
thinks, must have brought it from Wieliczka.f The author 
justly remarks, that this circumstance may elucidate the form- 
ation of meteoric stones, especially as there are other ex- 
amples, of which he quotes the meteorite of Juvenas, which 
corresponds with the dolerite of Meissner, or lava from Ve- 
suvius, and Stromeyer's discovery of nickel in the olivine 
of the Vogelsgebirge, which is verified as the olivine of Ve- 
suvius.:]: He says also, that, though no one can properly 
say that iron is a regular compound of meteoric stones, yet 
it may be introduced by electric polarity, through the friction 
of the falling and projected stone. He quotes a volcanic 
bomb from Vesuvius in 1830, which very readily attracted 
the needle from its meridian, when 40 grains of it were mingled 
with one third part of hydrogen gas and sulphuric acid, the 
bomb containing traces of fused iron. (Bulletin de la Hoc. des 
Natu7\ de Moscoti, vol. v. p. 59 — 63.) The title of Dr. Her- 
mann's paper in the Bulletin is, " Untersuchungen verschie- 
dener in Russland gefallener meteorischer Substanzen von R. 
Hermann." In addition to those here recorded, we may men- 
tion that an aerolite fell at Bjelostock, in Russia, on Oct. 8. 
1827, at 9-10 a. m. {Gaz. Geog., p. 238.) In the same year 
fell a meteorite at Drake's Creek, 18 miles from Nashville, 
Tennessee. 

The views of Dr. Hermann are borne out by the analysis 
of an aerolite which fell near Richmond, in Virginia, on 
June 4. 1828. Both microscopic and chemical examination 
proved it to be composed of mineral substances well known. 
It contained the chrysolite, feldspar, phosphate of lime, me-

306 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

teoric iron, and protosulphuret of iron, in distinct crystals. 
The two former substances made up the greater jiart of the 
mass. Every thing gave reason to suppose that this stone 
was volcanic, (Amer. Jour., xvi. 194.) * 

It now remains for me to offer a few remarks respecting 
the origin of the extraordinary phenomena which have been 
the subject of my present observations. Various hypo- 
theses have been brought forward to solve the difficulty. 
Some have contended that meteors are independent bodies, 
revolving like comets, and occasionally brought within the 
earth's atmosphere. Others, with the celebrated Halley at 
their head, considered them to be combustible vapours sud- 
denly ignited on the verge of our atmosphere. Dr. Blagden 
(PML Trans., 1784.) regarded them as electrical. M. 
Izarn and others believed them to be volcanic materials pro- 
jected in eruptions. Chladni considers them as unconnected 
substances afloat in free space, suddenly inflamed. Olbers 
and the editors of the Phil. Trans, abridged have regarded 
them as projectiles from the moon. This, however, is giving 
to the man in the moon a skill in rifle-shooting which we 
have no authority for. Surely Dr. Herschel, who has 
brought the volcanoes of the moon within forty miles of 
Hounslow, would have seen an eruption before now, if they 
be so frequent f as these supposed selenitic bodies would in- 
fer, in that hypothesis. The latest notions on the subject are, 
those of Mrs. Somerville {Connection of the Physical Sciences), 
whose hypothesis is that of Olbers ; and that of Dr. Brewster, 
quoting the experiments, &c., of Fusinieri (in the Encyclopcedia 
Britannica, vol. viii. p. 585. 7th ed. ; which latter has engaged 
the notice of the Edinburgh Reviexv, April, 1834, p. 170. 
The opinions of Fusinieri are entitled to the highest con- 
sideration. J He shows that, in electrical experiments, and 

* The meteoric iron of Louisiana, and of Santa Rosa, in South America, 
each contain the same proportions ; namely, iron, 90*02 parts ; nickel, 9'674. 
Mr. Sheppard considers them portions of one aerolite, which traversed the 
atmosphere in a direction parallel to the extent of America. ( Silliman's 
Journal^ xvi. 217.) Berzelius has given the analysis of a meteorite which 
fell in Macedonia (date unknown), which is principally composed of nickel, 
iron, magnetic pyrites, and olivine. (Archiv Kastner.y xvii. 228.) 

\ " The fall of meteoric stones is much more frequent than is generally 
believed; hardly a year passes without some instances occurring," &c. 
^Somerville ^ p. 401.) 

X Injustice to him, as well as to my own reasonings, I must here quote 
a passage from the article on Electricity, in the Encyc. Brit. : — 

" M. Fusinieri has collected and detailed many interesting observations 
respecting the substances deposited by lightning upon the various parts of 
houses which have been struck by it; but we regret that our limits will not 
permit us to pursue any farther this most important subject. These and 



prevalent Disorder s, Sfc, with Volcanic Emanations, 807 

in thunder storms, mineral substances are evaporated by the 
heat evolved, and that portions of metals, &c., are actually 
carried off by the electric action, and deposited upon other 
bodies, by precipitation, in a state of ignition and fusion. 
Now, allowing this to be the case, and the evidence adduced 
in this paper strengthens the idea, we need not, I think, go 
beyond the earth for a solution of the enigma. The whole 
mass of testimony, without an exception, involves the notion 
of intense heat, and the developement of electric force. 

We have seen, in what has gone before, that meteors and 
meteorites must have a similar origin ; that they are con- 
nected with electric phenomena ; that they produce or are 
followed by electrical changes in the atmosphere ; that snow, 
rain, hail, lightning, the aurora borealis, shooting stars, and 
aerolites are frequently contemporaneous and connected with 
each other, and with earthquakes and volcanic emanations 
and explosions; that, about the time when the earth is in 
particular excitement from the latter phenomena, the former 
are more numerous and most intense ; and that very fre- 
quently direct evidence has been afforded of a volcanic origin. 
Analysis has proved that there is no substance in meteorites 
not found in the earth, except in one or two particular cases, 
as in that of Sterlitamanck and Kirianova ; that nickel, long 
supposed to be a meteoric metal, is found in mineral masses 
of terrestrial origin ; and that there are frequently traces of 

many other facts seem to prove that iron exists in the air and in clouds, 
and it is well known that the same metal mixed with manganese, nitrous 
salts, and organic substances, is found in rain water. M. Fusinieri is of 
opinion, that the iron has been drawn from the earth, and chiefly from 
mountains, where the mines are most frequented, and where storms com- 
monly begin to form. [This by the way agrees perfectly with the idea of 
Dr. Hermann.] The colouring matter of snow and rain, and the existence 
of meteoric stones, prove the existence in our atmosphere of dry and ferru- 
ginous vapours, the molecules of which are more or less rarefied or con- 
densed, according to the causes which may generate them. The fact that 
meteoric stones fall during the prevalence of storms and other electric 
phenomena, and especially the fact that hailstones have sometimes a 
nucleus of small pieces of sulphuret of iron, appear to M. Fusinieri to 
afford the true origin of these remarkable bodies. It has been already 
proved that electricity does transport matter; and when we consider, as 
Ampere has shown, that magnetic currents surround our globe, that matter 
in an extreme state of subdivision spontaneously expands itself, and that 
radiating heat, like electricity, transports ponderable substances, we may 
obtain a very simple explanation of the origin of meteoric stones. As the 
temperature of the surface of the globe is not high enough to detach from 
it the material bodies which exist in the atmosphere, M. Fusinieri concludes 
that we ought to attribute this action to other causes, which are yet to be 
discovered, rather than deny a fact so complctclif demonstrated ^ (p. C21.) 
May not my illustrations in this paper justify me in considering a sufficient 
cause already discovered ?

positive volcanic matter in stones that have fallen at a time 
when no volcano has been in the immediate vicinity. We 
know, also, that volcanic ejections have been carried even 
from Vesuvius and Etna as far as Constantinople ; and that 
there must be thousands of earthquakes and volcanic erup- 
tions, of which we can know neither the character nor the 
existence. 

How volcanic agents are primarily called into action, I 
do not profess to understand : the object of these researches 
(if such they may be called) is not to speculate on the origin, 
but the supposed effects, of terrestrial derangement. That 
electricity is intimately connected with certain states of the 
earth, and that those states or those effects do modify the 
variations of the atmosphere, there is no question : but whe- 
ther electricity be itself a first cause of earthquakes, or, like 
magnetism (to which it appears to be akin, if not identically 
the same thing under another form), merely a secondary 
cause, produced by volcanic action, itself reproducing corre- 
sponding phenomena, I do not intend to moot. It is suf- 
ficient for my purpose, to endeavour to show, as I think I 
have satisfactorily shown, that the meteors which have been 
such extraordinary objects of interest during the last few 
years, especially during 1832, 1833, 1834, are, as far as the 
produced examples warrant us in believing, more likely to 
have arisen in consequence of the increased action in the 
interior of the earth, as developed by earthquakes and vol- 
canic emanations, than from any other cause with which we 
are acquainted. Should it ever happen that we actually 
ascertain every substance contained in the earth, the interior 
of which may be of different construction to its crust, which 
appears to be a huge galvanic and electrical apparatus, it will 
then be time to speculate on the moon or the planets, should 
a substance which the chemists of that day may not actually 
know, come within the reach of their crucibles and tests.

Mr. Bree will allow me to make use of his observations, in

inclined to accept that as a solution of his enquiij. 

A writer in the Hereford Journal (May, 1834) says that 
insects have wonderfully increased in that county this season. 
He mentions cockchafers especially ; and says, that at Cal- 
dicott and Bullingham, two fields, with the gates, &c., were 
covered by a black caterpillar, with white spots on the side 
of the body. They were collected in heaps and burned. This 
corresponds with what is mentioned of the years 1762 and 
1782, at p. 197. The gout in wheat is also very common at 
this time in Dorsetshire, a complaint known to be the effect 
of insects. — W, B. C.

Art. II. Shakspeare a Naturalist. By S. H. 

" He was an exact surveyor of the inanimate world ; his descriptions 
have always some peculiarities, gathered by contemplating things as they 
really exist." — Johnson's Preface to Shakspeare' s Plays, 

If it be possible to add a charm to the pursuit of natural 
history, I think it would be done by associating it with the 
study of poetry, to which it seems so strongly allied, that 
one might be surprised how it ever got separated, did one 
not consider how many men there are whose whole wish and 
endeavour seem to be to render knowledge impopular and 
exclusive, and to make harsh and crabbed *' what is musical 
as Apollo's lute." Every lover of nature, that is of the fields, 
the woods, the rocks, the mountains, and the things that are 
therein, must, necessarily, be of a poetical temperament, for in 

X 3 



310 Shaks])eare a Naturalist, 

all these objects is the soul of poetry contained, and it is to 
these the poet must look for inspiration ; for in nature is the 
" only fund of great ideas.'* To such a one as this, the author 
whom I propose to illustrate must be a favourite, as being of 
a kindred spirit, and to him the instances I quote, and the 
illustrations I may make will be familiar ; but there are many 
who read this great author who are not naturalists, but feel 
the greatest admiration of his writings from other sources; 
and, for these, I shall endeavour to open a new channel of 
gratification and, it may be, lead them to investigate more 
narrowly what they read so happily touched on. 

Shakspeare, though, I suspect, little acquainted with books, 
and certainly not with systems, for in his day they did not 
exist, was an excellent naturalist ; for he had studied, doubt- 
less, where all who wish to become really and truly acquainted 
with nature must study, in the open air, in the fields, and in 
the woods. In the truant occupations of childhood, in bird- 
nesting, nutting, &c., we may fancy that his knowledge was 
attained ; and, doubtless, it is in these wanderings that many 
of us acquire our first taste for the things of nature, and be- 
come acquainted with the habits of the beings that cross our 
path.* But in Shakspeare these truancies continued in man- 
hood, and to these we owe, in particular, those many beautiful, 

[* " Shepherd. Do you ken, Mr. North, that every thocht, every feeling, 
every image, every description, that it is possible for a poet to pour out 
frae within the sanctuary o' his spirit, seems to be brought frae a hidden 
store, that was gathered and girncU'd, and heaped up by himsell uncon- 
sciously during the heavenly era o' early life ? 

" North. True, James, true. O call not the little laddie idle that is 
strolling by some trotting burn's meander, all in aimless joy by his happy 
self — or angling, perhaps, as if angling were the sole end of life, and all 
the world a world of clear running waters — or bird-nesting by bank and 
brae, and hedge-row and forest-side, with more imaginative passion than 
ever impelled men of old to voyage to golden lands — or stringing blae- 
berries on a thread, far in the bosom of woods, where sometimes to his 
quaking heart and his startled eyes, the stems of the aged mossy trees 
seemed to glimmer like ghosts, and then in a sudden gust of the young 
emotion of beauty, that small wild fruitage blushed with deeper and deeper 
purple, as if indeed and verily gathered in Paradise — or pulling up by the 
roots, — that the sky-blue flowers might not droop their dewy clusters, 
when gently the stalk should be replanted in the rich mould of the nook 
of the garden, beside the murmuring hives, — the lovely Hare-bells, the 
Blue Bells of Scotland — or tearing a rainbow branch of broom from the 
Hesperides — or purer, softer, brighter far than any pearls ever dived for in 
Indian seas, with fingers trembling in eagerest passion, yet half-restrained by 
a reverential wonder of their surpassing loveliness, plucking from the 
mossy stones primroses and violets ! And almost sick with the scent of 
their blended balm, faint, faint, faint as an odour in a dream — and with 
the sight of their blended beauty, the bright burnished yellow, — yes, at 
once both bright and pale, — and the dim celestial blue, — yes, at once 
both celestial and sullen, — unable to determine in the rapt spirit within 
him, whether primrose or violet be the most heavenly flower of the wilder- 
ness! .'XBlac/avuocrs Magazhie, " Noctes Ambrosianse," Nov. 1828.)] 



ShaJcspeare a Naturalist, 311 

and one pathetic, notices of the antlered race, whose habits 
he had studied in the park at Charlecote, near Stratford. 

The object of the present paper will be, to show what a 
wonderful acquaintance Shakspeare possessed with the objects 
of nature, far beyond any dramatist or poetic writer of his age ; 
how accurate and just his descriptions of the habits and 
appearance of these objects are ; and to give an account of 
the fabulous animals, and fanciful suppositions regarding those 
that actually exist. By this latter division of the subject will 
be exhibited the popular notions upon natural history, of the 
days of our author ; for, when he relates any of those super- 
stitious ideas, we may rely, I think, upon their being those 
entertained by the people of his day, since his small acquaint- 
ance with the classical and other writings of Rome and Greece, 
precludes the chance of his having drawn them from those 
sources : nevertheless, he mentions many animals of this class, 
with which his school reading, and the translations of the 
writers of antiquity then existing, must have supplied him. To 
illustrate these divisions will be my aim, by passages confirm- 
atory or explanatory, drawn from ancient and modern authors. 

Before entering upon the more systematic part of this essay, 
it will not be uninteresting to observe with what comparisons 
he portrays the beauty, excellence, and general character of 
the fairest part of the creation, and of her lord and master. 
If his female is beautiful, he gives her " doves' eyes," and 
" roses in her cheeks," with lips like " kissing cherries," and 
face of " lily tincture." She is " straight as a wand;" her 
fingers are white as milk, and soft as Jlowers ; her embraces 
like the encvccWug o^ woodbine and honeysuckle ; and her supe- 
riority over her fellows is compared to a " snowy dove trooping 
with crows.^^ Her voice is melodious, 

" More tunable, than lark to shepherd's ear 
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear." 

If she be angry, which I have heard the sex sometimes is, 
she is like a " fountain troubled ; " if she be deceitful, her tears 
prove crocodiles. After all, when time and beauty is over, 
from her " fair and unpolluted flesh" the " violets spring." 

If he describes the dignity of man, it is thus, in a passage 
which needs no comment : — " What a piece of work is 
man ! how noble in reason ! how infinite in faculties ! in form 
and moving, how express and admirable ! in action, how like 
an angel ! in apprehension, how like a god ! the beauty of 
the world I the paragon of animals !" If he describes him 
angry, he is like an " empty eagle," or a ^^lion wanting prey ;" 
if still and imperturbable, his visage 

" Docs cream and mantle like a standing pool;" 
X 4 



312 Shahspeare a Naturalist, 

if a lover, 

" He may bestride the gossamers 
That idle in the wanton summer air, 
And yet not fall ; " 

if a villain with a smiling cheek, he compares him to " a 
goodly apple rotten at the heart ;" and, when old, his arms are 

" Like to a wither'd pine 
That drops its sapless branches to the ground." 

When Warwick dies, in what a fine strain of metaphor, 
drawn from natural objects, he makes him lament : 

" Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, 
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle. 
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept ; 
Whose top branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree. 
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. 
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil. 
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun. 
To search the secret treasons of the world." 

When Wolsey falls from his high state, how beautifully he 
moralises ; comparing man to a tree that puts forth leaves, 
blossoms, and then is killed by frost when its fruit is ripening. 
These lines are too well known to present them here. In 
another passage he likens his fall to " a bright exhalation in 
the evening," which passes swiftly away and is no more seen ; 
another phenomenon of nature, equally well selected with the 
former, to express the suddenness with which worldly glory 
and prosperity frequently disappear. 

There are a few more passages regarding man which must 
yet be noticed ; such as the accurate description of the appear- 
ances presented by one who had been strangled, and the 
sensations of one poisoned. They both contain that which, 
if all the rest were' wanting, would prove Shakspeare to have 
been a most accurate and intense observer of nature, whether 
human or external. 

" See ! his face is black, and full of blood ; 
His'eye-balls further out than when he lived; 
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man: 
His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretch'd with struggling. 
His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd 
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdued."

And comfort me with cold." King John, act 5. sc. 7,

The next quotations I shall insert, show that the existence 
of the goitre, incident to mountaineers, was known in this 
country in Shakspeare's time ; and that credit was given to 
the inventions of travellers, too fertile in that age, concerning 
the human race. From these inventions we must except the 
cannibals, or anthropophagi, which, to the infamy of our 
nature, did some few years ago exist in New Zealand. See 
Pliny's Nat. Hist., lib. vii. cap. ii., for the fabulous varieties 
of the human race. 



" When we were boys. 



Who would believe that there were mountaineers, 

Dewlap'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at thera

Whose heads stood in their hearts." Tempesty act 3. sc. 3. 

" The cannibals that each other eat, 
The anthropophagi^ and men whose heads 
Do grow beneath their shoulders." Othello^ act 1. sc. 3. 

I now proceed with a more regular distribution of my 
subject. [" Unicorns " are the subject next treated of; but 
these we pass, and take that which succeeds them : the stag.] 

STAG. 

" The wretched animal [a stag] heaved forth such groans, 
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat 
Almost to bursting ; and the big round tears 
Coursed one another down his innocent nose 
In piteous chase." As you like it, act 2. sc. 1. 

" Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends." Ibid. 

" If we be English deer, be then in blood : 
Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch ; 
But rather moody mad, and desjjerate stags. 
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel. 
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay." 

Henry VI., Part i. act 4. sc. 2. 
" Like the stag when snow the pasture sheets, 
The barks of trees thou browsedst." 

Antony and Cleopatra, act ] . sc. 4. 

The tears of the wounded stag, so pathetically described 
above, I find thus mentioned by Sir Philip Sydney [Arcadia, 
b. 1.) Kalander, " with a crossbow, sent a death to the poor 
beast [a deer], ^who mth tears showed the unkindness he 
took of man's cruelty :" and Herrick makes apartofOberon's 
feast to consist of " slain stag's tears." 

In Jesse's Gleanings, p. 187., the fact of a wounded stag 
being abandoned by the herd is thus confirmed. " It is well 
known, that, when a hard-pressed deer tries to rejoin his com- 
panions, they endeavour to avoid and get away from him as 
much as possible, or try to drive him away with their horns." 
And in the same author it is, I believe, mentioned, that deer

feed upon the barks of trees in severe winters, unless fodder 
is supplied them, as is usual at that season.

[The subjects of the remainder of our correspondent's long 
essay are the following, and are disposed in the following 
order : —

The citations and remarks relative to the horse, the ass, 
the lioness, and the dog, we have taken the liberty to append 
in the form of notes, to the following communication by Dr. 
Turton upon these and kindred subjects, as its spirit is so 
congenial with that of our present correspondent's communi- 
cation as to make the association, we think, congruous, and 
hope pardonable. To print, at once, the whole of the citations 
and remarks upon all the subjects named above would give 
us, in our own feeling, much pleasure ; but the pressure of 
more technical matter forbids the doing of this at present, 
and may prevent our recurring to it. The portion given 
above, with the four notes, identified as our author's, to the 
communication placed after this, is an indication of his in- 
genious intentions, and a specimen, though scarcely a just 
one, of his plan of fulfilling them. His object and plan must 
be viewed with the welcome of sympathy by every student of 
natural history who is, at the same time, a lover of poetry ; 
and who can there be, as our correspondent has, in effect, 
asked above, that, loving the one, loves not the other also ? 
Of the lovers of nature, and these must be all who love their 
" intellectual being," those who are most intimate with the 
qualities and wonders discoverable in nature, will be those 
who will most concur in the delighting sentiment (delighting 
because true, and justly complimentary to the object of our 
pursuit), that " in nature is the ' only fund of great ideas ; ' " 
and we know not any subject nearer our heart than the one 



Zoological Recollections, 315 

which these words bespeak, or one which could form a fitter 
theme for the thoughts, and essay in proof, of every naturalist. 
It is one upon which we have long, ourselves, cherished hopes 
of attempting something, as we had purposed instancing on 
the present occasion ; but we find ourselves precluded by the 
want of time, of space of page, and, more than all, by the 
want of the requisite power of comprehension to grasp such a 
subject. We have found ourselves quite in the case of Si- 
monides, when he strove^ to answer the question of Hiero ; 
and the two attempted objects are, truly may it be said, so 
similar as to be almost identical. We would, however, not- 
withstanding our own inability, cherish the hope that some 
accomplished correspondent will attempt it. In V. 114, 115, 
there are "samples and a taste" of the fruits of this land of 
promise. 

In connection with our correspondent S. H/s elucidation 
of Shakspeare's mentions of objects of nature and natural 
history, we may cite a reference to IV. 425, note f ; and may 
add, for we have obtained permission to do so, that Mr. 
James Fennell, a correspondent of this Magazine, has been, 
as we had known, " for some time occupied in collecting and 
arranging all Shakspeare's dramatic and poetical mentions of 
objects in natural history, with a view to the publication of 
them [in a separate work], together with such explanatory 
and descriptive notes as " he may deem " requisite." Mr. 
Fennell has informed us that he purposes adding " an essay 
on Shakspeare's knowledge of science in general, including 
chemistry, medicine, phrenology, &c. " ; his object, like that 
of our correspondent S. H., " will not only be to explain and 
illustrate Shakspeare's allusions and mentions, but also to 
diffuse a taste for the study of natural history, and to show

THE HORSE. 



This majestic quadruped, whose prowess and might, fami- 
liarly known to us all, are poetically stated in the book of 
Job (xxxix. 19 — 25.), gives his name to many circumstances 
charged with more than common force and strength ; as horse- 
radish, horse-chestnut, horse-play, horse-kiss, horse-laugh. 
His age is known by the teeth; whence the saying, as applied 



316 Origines %oologicce^ 

to green old age, or elder gaiety, that he has still a colt's 
tooth in his head : and, of a present which may not exactly 
meet the wishes of the receiver, it is observed, that we must 
not look a gift horse in the mouth. The common term 
course, as the first course or match, second course, &c., may 
be taken from the sport of racing ; and so the course, or bent 
of a man's studies, whence stud. Formerly, in horseraces, 
the prize was a gold or silver bell ; whence we say of any 
successful adventurer, that he bears the bell ; and of a haughty 
person, we observe, that he rides a high horse, or the fore 
horse. Small bells were, anciently, an essential part of the 
gaudy trappings of a horse, both from their musical jingle, 
and that notice might be given of his approach in narrow 
lanes. " A horse trapped with silver bells," says Stowe, 
" was given by the citizens of London to King Richard the 
Second, on his entrance into the city." At the coronation of 
one of the Edwards, five hundred horses were turned loose, 
as a largess to such as could catch them. The horseshoe 
was of old considered as the emblem of good luck, and as 
having power to avert witchcraft, and drive off evil spirits ; 
and it is still sometimes seen on the threshold of the peasant, 
and nailed against the masts of vessels. To ride the wooden 
horse, or the horse that is foaled of an acorn, was once a 
severe mode of military punishment, called picketing; inflicted 
by placing the miserable culprit across some oaken planks, 
brought to a sharp edge or angle, with a carbine or heavy 
weight fastened to each foot, to render his seat more exqui- 
sitely painful : and from this circumstance may have origin- 
ated the expression of horsing a boy in a public school. 

Darius was chosen king by the neighing of his horse ; and 
Caligula made his horse a senator. One of Hector's horses, 
called Xanthus, was a conjuror, whose prophecies are recorded 
in Homer ; and Troy was taken by a horse. Pliny relates 
that the chariot of Nero was drawn by four hermaphroditical 
mares. In derision of conjugal pusillanimity, we say, that 
the grey mare is the better horse ; and, as a joke upon 
preposterous mirth, it is said that a mare's nest is found. 

The phrase of a man's hobbyhorse originates from the cir- 
cumstance of boys riding upon sticks, or cock-horses. 

By Aristotle, and the older writers on comparative anatomy, 
he is said, in common with all those quadrupeds which have 
solid hoofs, to have no gall. Accurate enquiry, nevertheless, 
will demonstrate that, although there will be found no distinct 
gall bladder, there is a thin membranous substance, under 
which is contained the gall, branching itself into the lobes of 
the liver, and diffusing itself into the intestines ; and this

may reconcile a contradiction of words in Pliny, who in one 
place affirms that the horse has no gall, and in another, that 
the gall of a horse is poisonous, and forbidden to be touched 
by the priests in the sacrifices of horses at Rome.* Sports- 
men formerly hid themselves behind a figure made to resemble 
a horse, and called a stalking-horse, to get unperceived near 
their prey ; so to make another person entirely subservient to 
your own purposes, is said to make a stalking-horse of him. 
From the various methods of trimming and ornamenting the 
tails of horses, have arisen the expressions of cut and long 
tail, rag, tag, and bobtail. 

Our Saxon ancestors venerated the horse; whence the 
figure of the white horse, in the vale of that name, in Berk- 
shire; and near Calne in Wiltshire. From his Saxon origin, 
the king bears a white horse in his arms : and Hengist, or 
Hengst, the founder of the Saxon dynasty, means an entire 
horse. The white horse of death is an emblem of pure and 

* Shakspeare has said, in his character of Hamlet, 

" I am pigeoii-liver'd, and lack gall 

To make oppression bitter," 

and Mr. James Fennell was, some time ago, wishing to know, in relation 
to his projected notes on Shakspeare's mentions of natural objects, of 
which I have spoken in p. 315., whether the pigeon is devoid of gall, as 
the above lines intimate, or not ? I referred the query, not long after 
receiving it, to Mr. Yarrell, who was so kind as to communicate the 
following 

List of Animals which have not a gall-bladder. — "Sir, Your enquiry. 
What species, among Mammalia and birds, have, or have not, a gall-blad- 
der? will, at this late period of the month, only admit of, and must be. 
my excuse for, a short and hastily written reply. Among Mammalia, the 
Quadrumana, Carnivora, and Marsupialia have a gall-bladder, I believe, 
universally. In the Rodentia, there are some exceptions. Of the genus 
MuSy the black rat, the Norway rat, the common mouse, and some others, 
have no gall-bladder ; but Myoxus and Arvicola, have gall-bladders; the 
porcupine is said to have a gall-bladder, but it is very small; and the 
American species, i/ystrix dorsata, has none. The sloths have no gall- 
bladder, but I am not aware of any other instances among the Edentata. 
In the Pachydermata there are several exceptions. The elephant, peccary, 
rhinoceros, //irax capensis, tapir, and all the species of the genus jE^juus, 
are without the gall-bladder. Among the lluminantia, the camel, the 
giraffe, and the deer generally with solid deciduous horns, have no gall- 
bladder ; but the hollow-horned ruminants, as sheep, goats, antelopes ; and 
the species of the genus /^os, have a gall-bladder. In birds, the excep- 
tions are much less frequent, considering the extent of the class. Those 
without the gall-bladder are, as far as I am aware, the toucans and parrots, 
pigeons, grouse, peafowl, and ostrich. In the gall-bladder the watery part 
of the bile is aborbed, it becomes thicker, and its powers probably more 
energetic. — Wm. Yarrell. Dec. 24. 1833. 

As, however, the pigeon, and all the animals noticed above, as devoid of 
a gall-bladder, have, as I have understood from Mr. Yarrell, a biliary system, 
not one of them can be said to " lack gall." — J. 1).

THE ASS. 

This patient and hardy quadruped seems to have been of 
late importation into these islands, as he was unknown in the 
time of Holinshed. His original destination, in this king- 
dom, appears to have been the carriage of ore from the mines, 
in mountainous countries, as being more firm and sure-footed 

* Wigs from the hair of the mane. Query, from that of the tail ? Horace 
Smith, in his pretty satire beginning with 

" Since mortals are all, both great and small. 
Created by their dresses j" 

has these lines : — 

" For the judge's nob, may its wisdom rob 
From the tail of a four-legg'd mother ; 
And the grandeur's germ of the human worm 
May spring from its silken brother." 

We have been told that the long side curls of a judge's wig are derived 
from the terminal hairs of cows' tails ; these hairs are of some length. 
We may exercise the spirit of the poet's satire without arraigning the 
judges. — J. D. 

[The following mentions by Shakespeare, appertaining to the horse, are 
taken from the unpublished part of the communication by S. H., which 
precedes the present one by Dr. Turton. 

" Then I beat my tabor, 

At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,

than the horse. He is now much deteriorated, for want of 
care, since the introduction of canals and raih'oads. 

Low as this useful animal may be held in estimation, by the 
natives of the colder regions of the north, where he is pro- 
verbial for his stupidity and obstinacy; yet, in the genial 
warmth of his native plains, where the horse is enfeebled, 
and unfit for laborious services, he is of large size, active, 
and vigorous. In Asia he is worshiped for his patience 
and humility; and, for these virtues, has a festival to his 
honour. The city of Jerusalem (Isaiah, xxxii. l^.), in its 
desolation, was compared, by the prophet, to a joy of wild 
asses. And in Job, xxxix. 5 — 8., his native and untame- 
able wildness is beautifully described : — " Who hath sent out 
the wild ass free ? or, who hath loosed the bands of the wild 
ass ? whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren 
land for his dwelling. He scorneth the multitude of the 
city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. The 
range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after 
every green thing." The wild ass of the mountains, here so 
exquisitely portrayed, may be, in all probability, the zebra. 

The ass is said to be extremely curious in the selection of 
his food ; whence an irresolute person is compared to the ass 
who perished for want between two pottles of hay, not having 
courage to determine which to fasten upon first.* As a 
domestic quadruped he is of early record ; for Anak, the de- 
scendant of Esau, is said to have found the mules in the wilder- 
ness, as he fed the asses of Zebim, his father. Horace has 
said, that only the hoof of the mule could contain the waters 
of. the Styx. 

To this quadruped alone, of all those which are under the 
dominion of man, was once bestowed the powers of the 
human voice and reasoning, for the purpose of rebuking 
Balaam ; who, not perceiving the angel which stood before 
and interrupted him in his passage, smote the ass in anger. 
The animal, who had seen the angel stand before him in a 
narrow pass, and had attempted to escape, appealed to the 
justice and feelings of his master as an excuse for his conduct: — 
" What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me 
these three times ? Am not I thine ass, upon which thou 
hast ridden, ever since I was thine, unto this day ? and was 
I ever wont to do so unto thee ?" (Numbers, xxii. 30.) 

The ass was honoured by bearing upon his back the 

* " Would the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I might water 
an ass at it." (TroUus and Cressiday act 3. sc. 5.) 

The nicety of this animal, with regard to the water it drinks, is well 
known. It will refuse to touch what a horse would drink greedily. — S. H. 



320 Origines Zoologicce, 

Son of God, in his entry into Jerusalem. With the jaw- 
bone of an ass Samson slew a thousand of the Philistines ; 
from the hollow part of which a miraculous stream of water 
was made to flow, wherewith to quench his thirst. (Judges, 
XV. 15 — 19.) And when the prophet was returning from 
a feast, where he had been in disobedience to the commands 
of the Lord, he was slain by a lion ; and his ass, on which 
he rode, was found standing, together with the lion, by the 
side of the carcass, uninjured and undismayed. (1 Kings, xiii.) 
He has, nevertheless, been considered as the emblem of 
stupidity and folly. Midas, of old, for his scurvy decree 
between Pan and Apollo, was rewarded with the ears of an 
ass. Falstaff, when his eyes were first opened to the tricks 
played upon him by the Merry Wives of Windsor, exclaims, 
** I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass." And honest 
Dogberry, in indignant vindication of his office, says, " O 
that he were here, to write me down an ass ! But, masters, 
remember that I am an ass : though it be not written down, 
yet forget not that I am an ass." 

The milk of the ass is much esteemed, and is of valued 
efficacy, in cases of pulmonary affection. In the days of 
Augustus, the flesh of young asses was considered as the 
greatest delicacy of the table, more especially the shoulder. 
The first-born of man, and those animals which were pro- 
nounced to be clean, or fit for food, were ordered to be de- 
dicated to the Lord: but the ass, as unclean, was directed to 
be redeemed with a lamb ; and in default of such redemption, 
his neck was ordered to be broken. The skin is manufactured 
into a thick and polished material, used principally for tablets. 

THE LION. 

The emblem of courage and majesty: bold as a lion. In 
heraldry, the symbol of nobleness of birth, valour, and 
generosity; and borne on the banners of the tribe of Judah. 
He is said to sleep with the eyes open, probably because 
they are furnished with a nictitant membrane, or cover- 
ing, distinct from the lids; and, like most beasts of prey, 
as dogs and cats, the female brings forth the young blind. 
The kings of Persia, at this day, punish criminals with death, 
by casting the victims into the dens of lions ; and have a pair 
chained at the entrance to the palace for the purposes of state. 
So we read in the Chronicles, that the entrance to the audience 
chamber of King Solomon was guarded by two lions; and the 
six steps to his throne, by twelve golden lions, one on each 
side to each step. In the legends of romance, this noble 
animal was thought to be able to distinguish a true maiden, 



07' Zoolofiical Recollediatis, 321 



"to 



especially of the blood royal, to crouch at her feet, and defend 
her from the assaults of ravishers and giants. Formerly, he 
was supposed to be cowed by the crowing of a cock only ; and 
Pliny says, that whosoever is anointed with cock-broth, espe- 
cially if garlick be boiled with it, no lion nor panther will 
touch him. 

In the carcass of the young lion which Samson slew in 
his journey to Timnath, he found upon his return a swarm 
of bees and their honey ; and upon this circumstance founded 
the riddle with which he challenged the Egyptians : — '* Out of 
the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth 
sweetness !" (Judges, xiv. I'k) 

The lion was a peculiar object of veneration and regard 
among the Egyptians : for, when the sun enters the astrono- 
mical sign of Leo, the river Nile begins to flow, and promises 
its fertilising waters to the dry and parched plains of the 
Delta: hence we see in ancient structures imitative of the 
architecture of the East, as in many of the public buildings 
at Oxford, the water-spouts are ornamented with the heads 
of lions, dogs, and other figurative and fantastic semblances. 

This noble animal has hitherto been considered as of the 
cat genus, i^elis Z/Co, but is certainly worthy of generic dis- 
tinction ; not merely as containing several species of its own 
family, but as possessing characters peculiar to itself. It has 
no collar bones, and therefore cannot, like the cat and the 
tiger, climb nor strike its prey with a sidelong blow, but 
brings it down by a straight-forward pawing. From the dog 
it differs in having a nictitant membrane ; and in its inward 
pur of pleasure and confidence.* 

DOG. 

It is remarkable that from this faithful animal, the com- 
panion of man, and the guardian of his person and property, 
should originate all the terms of vile reproach and low com- 
parison ; as, you dog, you cur, you hound, you whelp, you 
puppy : so, dog's trick, dog cheap, dog trot, dog sick, dog 
weary, doggrel rhymes, to lead the life of a dog, or to use 
like a dog ; and Homer represents Jupiter, in his anger, 

[* " A lioness 

Lay crouching, head on ground, with catlike watch, 
When that the sleeping man should stir ; for 'tis 
The royal disposition of that beast, 
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead." 

As you like it, act 4. sc. 3. 
The correctness of the attitude of the feline tribe needs no comment. 
The latter observation, I believe, also correct, though, 1 fear, not to be 
referred to any " royal disposition " in that tribe." — ^S*. H. See p. 5. 139.]

calling his wife a brazen-faced b , huon adees. This may 

have originated in the East, where the dog is held in abhorrence, 
as the common scavenger of the streets. " Him that dieth in 
the city, the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the fields, 
shall the fowls of the air eat;" was said of Jeroboam and 
his family (1 Kings, xiv. 11.), of Baasha, (1 Kings xvi. 4.), a 
people about to be punished for their offences by famine and 
pestilence. A ravenous desire for food is called a canine 
appetite : and of a foul and gluttonous feeder it is said, that 
hungry dogs will eat dirty pudding. By the Israelites he was 
accounted so abominable, that, in the Levitical law, the price 
of a dog was forbidden to be offered in sacrifice. He has 
also been ever the miserable victim of most cruel experiments, 
by the anatomist and the philosopher : and when a tax was 
laid on his head, a general massacre of the species took place. 
By the Egyptians he was an object of adoration, as the repre- 
sentative of one of the celestial signs ; and by the Indians, as 
one of the sacred forms of their deities. 

" The Egyptians worshipp'd clogs, and for 

Their faith made internecine war." Hudibras. 

The canicular or dog days are so called, not because dogs 
are at that season apt to run mad, but from the heliacal 
rising of Sirius, or the dogstar, as typical of the season of 
greatest heat, or wane of the summer. 

In moonlight nights dogs, as the emblems of vigilance, are 
said to be more than usually watchful, and to " bay the moon ;" 
and are supposed to have a sense of the odour of mortal dis- 
solution, and to howl before the death of one of the family. 
They perspire by the tongue; and in hot countries, as in Africa, 
die if they be suddenly plunged into cold water. The young, 
or whelps, of the dog, as is the case with all quadrupeds which 
bring forth litters, and have the feet divided into many seg- 
ments or toes, are born blind, and so continue for ten or 
twelve days ; and at this time are probably deaf, as the valves 
of the ears are closed till the eyes are opened. 

Among other useful purposes, he is harnessed, and draws 
a peculiar kind of carriage, called a sledge, over the snow in 
the colder regions of the north. In Holland he is fastened 
in pairs to a small waggon [in Canada to carts, see VI. 511.], 
and draws vegetables and other light substances to the market. 
In Amsterdam there are regular dog ordinaries, where, as 
soon as he is unharnessed after his journey, he receives a 
small coin from his master, which he takes in his mouth to a 
well known establishment of this kind, and in exchange for 
his money is provided with a certain portion of meat. And

in many country places he is taught to turn the spit and roast 
the meat, by continued exercise in a kind of tread wheel. 

" But as a dog that turns the spit 
Bestirs himself, and plies his feet 
To climb the wheel ; but all in vain. 
His own weight brings him back again, 
And still he 's in the self-same place 
Where, at his setting out, he was." Hudibras, 

According to Horace, the sight of a bitch with young was 
considered as an unlucky omen; and of a sullen discontented 
person we say, that the black dog has walked over him. A 
certain German empiric, when his patient was surfeited by 
eating too much hare, directed him, upon the principles of 
antipathy and contrast, to take greyhound broth. And at 
the time when the place of resort for recreation to the citizens 
of London was at the sign of the Dog and Duck, a learned 
traveller, in portraying the manners of the British capital, 
relates that the inhabitants flocked to a certain place of en- 
tertainment to feed on dog and duck. 

Although in China and Tartary his flesh is used for food, 
and a living dog is said to be better than a dead lion, in 
Europe, his carcass is considered so utterly worthless, that 
even his skin is now of little value. The skins, however, of 
young puppies were formerly tanned, and formed a soft kind 
of leather which was manufactured into gloves. The hair of 
a dog, when burnt, was formerly prescribed as an antidote 
against the effects of intoxication : hence a man too much 
excited by drink at night, is recommended to take a hair of 
the same dog the next morning, as a means of gradually coun- 
teracting his state of debility. 

The greyhound is so called, not from any allusion to colour, 
but because he came originally from Greece, Canis G7'aius, 
and therefore should be written gralhound. 

[For anecdotes on the sagacity of dogs, see the second 
series of Jesse's GleaniTigs iii Natural History ; and in the 
Field Naturalist's Magazine, I. 485., there is an interesting 
communication " on the Fidelity and Attachment of Dogs to 
their Masters," by Miss Hunter.*]

WOLF. 

Ravenous, and of insatiable voracity ; the most abject 
poverty is represented by him who has nothing to keep the 
wolf from the door. So inauspicious was his appearance 
considered, that he, upon whom a wolf first fixed his eyes, was 
said to lose his voice suddenly : and, upon any abrupt pause 
in a discourse, it was said there was a wolf in the story, lupus 
est mfahula. This originated from one Lycus, which in the 
Greek language means a wolf; of whom, during his absence, 
many extravagant tales were related, which, by his sudden 
appearance, were immediately refuted and put to silence. 

So utterly worthless was this animal considered, that a 
price was always set upon his head : and, in the ancient law, 
an excommunicated person was said caput gerere lupinum ; 
and it was thought meritorious to destroy him, as a wretch 
thrust from the most common offices of social benevolence 
and humanity. 

One who has a ravenous or canine appetite is said to have 
a wolf in his belly. And a furious kind of insanity, in which 
the unhappy object went howling about, and believed him- 
self, and was believed by others, to be turned into a wolf, or 
some other beast, was called lycanthropy. This might give 
occasion to that bold assertion of Pliny, " That some men 

" That island of England breeds very valiant creatures, their mastiffs are 
of unmatchable courage." {Henry V., act 3. sc. 9.) 

" A dog, and bay the moon." Julius CcesaVy act 4. sc. 3. 

" Oft have I seen a hot d'erweening cur 

Run back and bite, because he ivas withheld ; 
Who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw, 
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs, and cried." 

Henry VI., Part ii., act 5. sc. 1. 
The above description of the hound is highly picturesque. The obse- 
quiousness of the spaniel is proverbial. For the following observation 
upon the British mastiff's celebrity, I am indebted to Dr. Fleming, Brit, 
An., p. 1 1. " The Roman emperors held the British dogs of this kind in 
high estimation for combats in the amphitheatre, and, according to Strabo, 
they were trained by the Gauls for battle." Every one who ever possessed 
a dog, knows that they " bay the moon," and that most piteously, sitting 
upon their haunches when the moon shines clear and frosty. To the 
former part of the last quotation, Ben Jonson has some lines of similar 
purport, which may confirm the truth of the remark : — 

" The eager, but the generous greyhound. 
Who ne'er so little from his game withheld. 
Turns head, and leaps up at his holder's throat." 

'Every Man in his Humour.

cally notices. — S.H.] [I have known a dog, and not a young one, that

were turned into wolves in his time, and from wolves to men 
again ;" and to that fable of Pausanias, of a man that was ten 
years a wolf, and afterwards turned to his former shape ; or 
to the tale of Ovid, who describes Lycaon as taking the shape 
of a wolf. And some commentators on the Bible have con- 
sidered Nebuchadnezzar's punishment as this kind of madness. 
(Daniel, iv. 33.) Hippocrates, in his treatise on insanity, 
supposes that the daughters of king Prisetus, who thought 
themselves heifers, were afflicted with this malady. 

That Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf, was a 
figurative fiction, from the circumstance of the name of their 
nurse, who was called Lupa. We learn also from Horace, 
that a part of the incantations of disappointed women con- 
sisted in secretly burying at night the beard, or probably 
the mane, of a wolf, and the teeth of a serpent. 

" Lupi barbam, variae cum dente cxDlubrae 
Abdiderint fiirtim terris." 

In Puck's delightful imagery of midnight, at the end of 
Midsummer Nighfs Dream, all the printed editions represent 
the wolf as looking on the moon : — 

" Now the hungry lion roars, 
And the wolf beholds the moon." 

This is probably an error, and might be easily corrected — 
" And the wolf behowls the moon," 
as Shakespeare in another place expresses the same idea, 

CAT, 

Originally came from Persia, and was unknown to Pliny 
and the Roman writers ; whence the term puss, probably a 
corruption of Pers. Soon after her introduction into these 
islands, she was considered of such value, that by the laws 
of Howel Dha, whosoever killed the king's cat, for his fine 
and atonement was to hold her up by the tip of the tail, so 
that her nose touched the ground, and heap up wheat till the 
body, to the tail's tip, was covered. 

The cat is a fixed and settled domestic animal, attached 
to the premises, and unwilling to remove; while the dog 
follows the master : and such is the natural antipathy and 
discordance between these two animals, that, of persons living 
in no very social harmony, it is said, they lead the life of cat 
and dog. She has a more voluminous and expressive vocabu- 
lary than any other known brute: the short twitter of com- 
placency and affection to her kittens ; the pur of tranquillity 
and pleasure, when seated on the knee of her master; the 
spit of defiance ; the mew of distress ; the growl of anger :

and the horrible wailings of pain or fighting, which give name 
to the noisy and discordant instrument of disapprobation, the 
catcall. 

She is the emblem of the moon, from the great change- 
ableness of the pupil of the eye, which in the daytime is a 
mere narrow line, dilatable in the dark to a luminous globe; 
and she can, for this reason, like most animals of prey, see 
best by night. 

It was formerly the trick of the countrymen to substitute a 
cat for a sucking pig, and bring it to market in a bag : so 
that he who, without careful examination, made a hasty bar- 
gain, was said to buy a pig in a poke, and might get a cat 
in a bag; and a discovery of this cheat gave origin to the 
expression of letting the cat out of the bag, as a premature 
and unlucky disclosure. 

The fur of the cat was formerly used in the ornamental 
trimming of coats and cloaks: and in allusion to the unfitness 
of her flesh for food, it is said of any thing confined to one 
purpose only. What can you have of a cat but her skin ? The 
catgut used by ladies, and for rackets, and also the finer 
strings for violins, are made from the dried intestines of the 
cat; and a smaller kind of fiddle is called a kit: the larger 
strings are from the intestines of sheep and lambs. Her 
claws are retractile, and can be protruded with great violence 
in anger. Her scratch is supposed to be venomous, because 
a lacerated wound is more apt to fester than a definite cut 
with a sharp instrument. The tenacity of her hold gave 
origin to many metaphorical expressions and appellations ; 
as the cat, or tackle, for drawing up the anchor of a ship ; and 
a cat-o'-nine tails, or scourge, so called from the scratches it 
leaves on the skin like the clawings of a cat. A domestic 
implement for holding a plate before the fire, with six spokes 
or radii, three of which rest on the ground in whatever 
position it is placed, is called a cat, from the belief that, how- 
ever a cat may be thrown, she always falls on her legs. From 
her great powers of resistance, she is said to have nine lives. 
" 'Tis a pity you had not ten lives, a cat's and your own," 
says Ben Jonson, in Eve7\y Man in his Humour, The well- 
known tale of the monkey seizing hold of the paw of the cat, 
to get the roasted chestnuts from the hot embers, gave origin 
to the proverb, " to make a cat's paw of one," or to make 
another subservient to one's own purposes.* 

* This expression is of greater antiquity than many suppose ; for we find 
the story of the cat and the monkey thus related, as an original anecdote, 
in the Voyage round the World, by Dr. John Francis Gemilli Careri, in 1695.

The cat is very subject to vomitings : and every one too 
much addicted to excess of wine knows what is meant by 
shooting a cat. She has been supposed to be particularly 
fond offish, giving rise to the poetical simile, — 

" What female heart can gold despise ? 
What cat's averse to fish T' 

Gray, Ode on the Death of a favourite Cat. 

But this is not a probable fact : for if a plate of fish, and a 
plate of meat, either raw or dressed, be placed before her, 
she will generally prefer the meat. And it would be a pro- 
pensity not very natural, as she abhors water, and can in a 
great measure live without it; and is extremely cautious of 
wetting her feet. [For well-authenticated instances of cats 
voluntarily entering water to catch fish, see IV. 430. ; V. 4?7l. 
716., and the Field Natiiralisfs Magazine^ I. 511.] It is 
equally erroneous that she is subject to fleas : the small insect 
which infests the half-grown kitten being a totally different 
animal, exceedingly swift in running, but not salient, or leaping, 
like the flea. She is, however, especially the black kind, 
highly charged with electricity, visible in the dark, when 
irritated. 

Her attitudes and motions are all of great elegance, in 
consequence of her being furnished with collar bones; she 
can, therefore, convey food to her mouth by the paw*, like 
the monkey, can climb and clasp, strike sidewise, toss her 
prey upwards, and seat herself on an eminence of very con- 
fined and narrow surface, as the arm of an elbow chair, or 
her favourite position, the knee of her master. She is

as follows: — " D. Antony Machado de Brito, admiral of the Portuguese

him, and breaking all it found in the kitchen, he once, to be even with it, 
ordered a cocoa nut to be put upon the fire, which sort of fruit the mon- 
keys are most greedy of, and hid himself to see how that beast would 
take it without burning his paws. The cunning creature, coming at the 
usual hour, and finding its beloved food on the fire, looked about, and 
seeing a cat by the chimney, held her head in his mouth, and made use of 
her paws to take off the cocoa-nut, and, then cooling it in water, eat it; the 
Portuguese laughing to see the cat mewing about all day with the pain it 
had beenj put to." (Gem. Ilindostan, b. ii. chap. 1.) An ancient Latin 
author, in allusion to this, says : — " Simia quam similis turpissima bestia

Art. IV. A Description of the Habits of the Ringdove, 
By Charles Waterton, Esq. 

The supposed purity of the dove is a common topic with 
many writers; and their readers are apt to imagine that this 
bird has been more favoured by nature than the rest of the 
feathered tribe. What may be allowed to romantic and sen- 
timental composers cannot by any means be conceded to 
writers on natural history. Genuine ornithology would be 
offended at the attempt to introduce unwarrantable matter 
into her pages ; while her true votaries would always grieve 
on seeing it admitted into them. 

All wild birds which go in pairs are invariably attached to 
each other by Nature's strongest ties ; and they can expe- 
rience no feelings of what may be called mistrust or suspicions 
of unfaithfulness : otherwise we should witness scenes of 
ornithological assault and battery in every hedge and wood, 
during the entire process of their incubation. The soot- 
black crow is just as chaste, affectionate, and constant as the 
snow-white dove itself. The movements of both these birds, 
at a certain time of the year, tend exactly to the same mark. 
They are inherent and unalterable in them, and, of course, 
are not to be repressed or changed. At the interesting period 
of incubation. Nature knows no distinction betwixt the cooing 
of the dove and the cackling of the goose. Both sounds ex- 
press the same emotions, and are perfectly understood by the 
parties. They have only one plain and obvious meaning. 
Audubon's description of his lovesick turtle-dove, which 
listened with delight to her mate's " assurances of devoted 
affection," and was " still coy and undetermined, and seemed 
fearful of the truth of her lover," and, " virgin-like, resolved 
to put his sincerity to the test," is lovesome nonsense, as far 
as regards the feathered tribe ; and is a burlesque upon the 



Habits of the Ringdove% 329 

undeviating tenor of Nature's course. Those who approve of 
such absurd aberrations from the line of instinct allotted to 
birds, would do well to confine their studies to the romances 
on their drawing-room tables. Let us hope that better days 
are in store for ornithology ; and that when the ardent novice 
shall turn over the pages which may be really intended for 
his improvement in this fascinating study, he will find their 
contents in unison with what he will observe afterwards in 
Nature's boundless range. 

If size and beauty give a claim to priority, the ringdove 
will hold the first place in the scanty catalogue of the wild 
pigeons of Europe. It stays with us in Yorkshire the whole 
of the year ; and, in the winter months, it resorts chiefly to 
the turnip fields for sustenance, where it feeds voraciously on 
the leaves, and not on the body, of the turnip. The leaves 
are said to impart a rank and disagreeable taste to the flesh 
of the bird ; but this is easily prevented by cutting open the 
crop, as soon as the pigeon is killed, and discharging the 
contents. White of Selborne recommends this process. 
Towards evening the form of the ringdove becomes consider- 
ably changed. Having fed on the turnip tops during the 
course of the day, its crop gets so distended with food, that it 
gives to the fore part of the pigeon's body a very full appear- 
ance ; and this is easily discerned as the bird passes over your 
head to its evening retreat. The contents of the stomach 
having been digested during the night, we observe that the 
body has regained its ordinary proportions at the break of day. 
There has been a great increase of ringdoves during the 
winter season, in this part of the country, since the farmers 
have paid so much attention to the cultivation of turnips. On 
seeing the congregated numbers of these birds, one is led to 
imagine that there must be an annual influx of them, at the 
close of autumn, from some far distant part. As the ringdove 
is an unprotected bird, and much sought after on account of 
the delicacy of its flesh, I have strong doubts whether our 
breeding season can produce a sufficient supply to make up 
the flocks which are seen here in winter. At all events, in 
this quarter of Yorkshire very few young ringdoves are 
allowed to escape. Farmers and gamekeepers are ever on 
the look-out to transfer them from the nest to the kitchen. 
These marauders are so perpetually upon the watch that it 
has never yet been my lot to find a ringdove's nest in our 
neighbouring woods with full-fledged young ones in it ; 
although I am continually in the habit of straying into them, 
and looking for the nests with a careful and unwearied eye. 



330 Habits of the Ringdove, 

Wherefore, I conclude that our winter flocks receive mi- 
gratory individuals from distant regions. 

The ringdove, by not feeding on insects, renders no service 
to man while visiting his fields. On the contrary, it is known 
to injure him considerably in his crop of rising clover. As 
soon as this plant begins, under the influence of the vernal 
sun, to expand its leaves, the ringdove attacks the heart-shoot 
with fatal severity ; and much address is required on the part 
of the farmer to scare the birds from their favourite food. 
Leaving, however, the sons of Ceres to fight their own battles, 
I will merely add, that this handsome bird is protected here. 
I love to listen to its soothing murmurs, and take intense 
pleasure in observing its habits during the breeding season, 
when it becomes fully as tame as the domestic pigeon. The 
housekeeper often hints to me that a couple of them would 
look extremely well on the table ; and the farmer calls them 
devouring vermin. I receive the opinions of these respectable 
personages with perfect indifference ; and I sometimes soothe 
them by observing that where the ringdove has one friend, it 
has a thousand enemies, ready to prepare it for the spit, or to 
prevent for ever its return to the clover field. 

The ringdove lays tv/o snow-white eggs on a nest which 
may be termed a platform of sticks, so sparingly put together, 
that the eggs are easily seen througlwit by an eye habituated 
to look for them. On inspecting this apparent commence- 
ment or remnant of a nest, one is led to surmise, at the first 
glance, that the young are necessarily exposed to many a 
cold and bitter blast during the spring of this ever-changing 
climate. " But God tempers the wind," said Maria, *' to the 
shorn lamb ; " and, in the case before us, instinct teaches the 
parent bird to sit upon its offspring for a longer period after 
they are hatched than, perhaps, any other of the feathered 
tribe. In the meantime, the droppings of the young, which 
the old birds of some species carefully convey away, are 
allowed to remain in the nest of the ringdove. They soon 
form a kind of plaster strong and scentless. This adds con- 
sistency to the nest, producing, at the same time, a defence 
against the cold. The ornithologist, while going his autumnal 
beats, in quest of knowledge, on seeing this, will know imme- 
diately that the nest has contained young: should this be 
wanting, he may conclude that the nest has been abandoned 
at an early period. As he will find but very few nests with 
this species of plaster in them, he may conclude, to a cer- 
tainty, that the ringdove has a host of enemies in this country, 
and that it is seldom fortunate enough to rear its young to 



Habits of the Ringdove* 331 

that state in which the faculty of flying saves them from de- 
struction. 

No bird in the British dominions seems to resort to so 
many different trees and shrubs for the purpose of incubation 
as the ringdove. Not a tree, from the towering pine to the 
lowly thorn, ever comes amiss to it. There is something, 
too, peculiarly singular in the locality of some of the nests. 
While one is seen placed nearly on the topmost branches of 
the lofty sycamore, another may be found within four feet of 
the ground, in the humble shelter of the hedge-row bush. 
Last year, I found a ringdove sitting on one egg^ in a magpie's 
nest of the year gone by ; and I observed another ringdove, 
rearing two young ones, in a spruce fir tree, below that of a 
magpie, out of which I had taken seven eggs, and substituted 
fiXQ of a jackdaw in their place. It was interesting to see 
these two species of birds, one so calm and gentle, the other 
so pert and roguish, thus close to each other, at so critical a 
juncture. While I was observing them, I felt convinced that 
there are certain times in which birds are not so bent on 
plunder as we would fain suppose they are ; and, moreover^ 
that they can frequent each other's company in perfect peace 
and quiet. In this instance it appears that instinct showed 
the ringdove how to preserve her eggs from being plundered 
by her crafty neighbour, who, according to our own short- 
sighted view of ornithological economy, would have been apt 
to make free with them at the earliest call of hunger. The 
ringdove had settled there with her eyes open to her sup- 
posed danger; for the magpie was the first to get possession 
of the tree. 

I had but a faint idea of the habits of the ringdove until 
I had offered it an undisturbed asylum in this " valley free." 
Its movements are remarkably periodical. In mild winters, 
or more properly speaking, in winters of short continuance, 
it makes its first appearance on the island where my house 
stands, early in February. This year it came, for the first 
time, on the second of the month, and cooed in full note. 
From this period, it may be seen here, every day till Oc- 
tober, either in the sycamore trees, or in the ivy on the old 
ruined tower, or on the lawn, picking up the tender sprouts 
of grass. Provided you approach with " cautious step and 
slow," you may get within seven yards of different pairs of 
these birds ; and when the window-sash is down, they will 
come within a few paces of the place where you are standing, 
and allow you to gaze at them for any length of time. After 
the first week in October, they take their final leave of my 
island for the winter ; and never, by any chance, pay us even 



332 Habits of the Ringdove, 

one single solitary visit till February sets in ; though they may 
be seen every day in congregated numbers in other parts of 
the park, where they roost in the elm and fir trees. During the 
winter months, they are exceedingly shy and timorous, seek- 
ing for safety in lofty flight, the moment they see you ap- 
proach. They become quite silent towards the last week in 
October, and their notes are reduced to half their number 
for some days before they cease to coo entirely. At this 
period they discontinue those graceful risings and sinkings in 
the air, in which they appear to so much advantage during 
the whole of the breeding season. 

Thus we have a bird which, during the course of the year, 
at one time approaches the haunts of man with wonderful 
assurance, and at another shuns them with a timidity equally 
astonishing. I speak only of its diurnal movements ; for, at 
the close of day, both in winter and in summer, when not 
molested, this bird will come near to our out-buildings, and 
seek a roosting-place in the trees which surround them. 
This peculiarity of the ringdove in approaching so near to 
our mansions during the day in the breeding season, and then 
losing all confidence in us, as soon as incubation ceases, is 
not a mere accidental trait of one or two particular birds, 
whose usual habits may have been changed, either by want 
of food, or by protection offered ; but it is inherent in the 
whole species, when the bird is allowed by man to follow 
Nature's unerring mandates. 

I know of no British bird which has the colour of its 
plumage so constant as is that of the ringdove. I have 
never yet seen it vary ; and the white spot or segment of a 
circle on the back of its neck, from which it takes its name, 
is always of the same size. 

Ringdoves are exceedingly numerous here during summer; 
and when winter sets in, many thousands come every even- 
ing to take up their quarters for the night. They retire 
early to roost, and never leave the trees till all the other 
birds are on the stir. 

As yet, all attempts to reclaim this pigeon have been of no 
avail. I should suppose that it is not in the power of man 
to make it breed within the walls of a dovecot. For my own 
part, I am not exactly aware that its reduction to domestic- 
ation would be productive of much advantage to us. Let 
others offer it the same protection it enjoys with me, and 
there would always be an ample supply of ringdoves to fill 
their groves with softest murmurs, and furnish their tables 
with a delicious repast. Connoisseurs tell us that the flesh 
of the ringdove, in winter, has the flavour of moor game ; I

have fed on pigeons in many countries, but cannot say that 
T ever found them vary in taste from the pigeon which in- 
habits our common dovecots. Much, perhaps, depends upon 
the cooking. The cuHnary art, no doubt, with other im- 
portant sciences, has derived much benefit from the march of 
intellect. In London they will serve you up a ram cat for a 
Martlemas rabbit ; and we are told that in Paris a pair of old 
hunting boots can be stewed down into a very excellent and 
wholesome soup.

What I have to say respecting the birds of my neighbour- 
hood may be very insignificant, and beneath the notice of the 
ornithologist : I am sorry for it. I am no ornithologist ; yet, 
when I run after butterflies [VI. 224*. 54-1.], or ramble about 
the country to gather flowers, I cannot shut my eyes when a 
bird flits by me, nor stop my ears when he chooses to cheer 
me with his song. Observations gathered under such cir- 
cumstances are what I have now to offer. Some classification, 
however, appeared to be necessary ; but, as I do not profess 
to be a scientific ornithologist, that which was most accessible 
appeared to be the best suited to my purpose, and I have 
therefore made use of that furnished in Stark's Elements of 
Natural History: and now for our gossip.

dashed out his brains ! I have also known a hawk to pounce 
upon a bird hung up in a cage by a window ; when he, miss-

Is this owing to any defect of sight ? or is the attention so 
taken up with one object that another is not perceived ? 

T/ie Tenacity with which the Falcons grasp their Prey 
has frequently excited my admiration ; for I have seen them 
disturbed in every possible way, and yet making off with 
the prize : nay, I have even seen them killed, and yet retain 
their prey in their grasp. As an instance, perhaps the fol- 
lowing will be sufficient : — A neighbour of mine, a keen 
sportsman, was one day sitting by his kitchen-fire, when he 
heard a great clattering in his poultry-yard. Well knowing 
the meaning of such an uproar, he immediately started up, 
and, seizing his gun, determined to be revenged upon the 
aggressor. When he reached the yard, he observed a moor 
buzzard just clearing the top of one of his barleyricks, 
with a chicken in its claws. The buzzard was immediately 
fired at and struck severely, but escaped from sight. The 
following day, its carcass w^as found at some distance, and the 
chicken running about the same field uninjured. I have known 
instances in which the captive has been totally unable to 
release himself; and the sportsman has been absolutely obliged 
to open the claws of the dead bird in order to set the prey at 
liberty.* 

The Kestrel pays me a visit almost daily ; hovering for a 
considerable time in the air, then taking a rapid sweep to 
another part of the field, and there, again, hovering for 
another long space of time, apparently in the utmost enjoy- 
ment. What name can better describe the habits of such a 
bird than the wind-hover ?

A Method of catching Magpies [and other Species of Birds], which, I have 
been told, has been practised with success. A live magpie is fastened 
down to the ground on its back. In this situation, the noise which the 
bird makes, together with its exertions to release itself, attracts the atten- 
tion of other magpies, who come to its assistance. The first unfortunate 
bird which ventures within reach is so firmly grasped in the claws of the 
captive, that it may be taken up by the hand and secured, in order to be 
tied down in like manner to ensnare others : and thus the magpies are 
made to inveigle their own kind. This is no new method of entrapping 
birds : if I remember right, an exact representation of it is given in one of 
the curious prints of hunting pieces by Anthony Tempesta, who flourished 
between 1555 and 1630. In the same set of prints are representations of 
some other very curious methods of catching birds and other wild animals, 
as well as of the diversion of riding a crocodile. — W, T, Bree. Allesley

bird, is plentiful in this neighbourhood, our extensive woods 
furnishing him with a secure retreat. The great size and 
brilliant markings of this bird render it an object of no 
inconsiderable beauty when dead ; but its calm and easy and 
circuitous flight, as it wheels aloft in endless mazes until it 
vanishes from sight, and making the air resound with its 
ceaseless mewings, on a bright summer's day, renders it a 
sure source of interest when alive. The power of flight in 
this bird is amazing: I frequently watch him wheeling round 
and round and round, until my eye is completely fatigued, 
and yet not a feather appears to be in motion except the 
forked tail. How does he propel himself forward in such 
instances ? 

The Dispute respecting the Identity of the Henharrier and 
the Ringtail is, I presume, sufficiently settled ; and I need not, 
therefore, make any further allusion to it. 1 have now before 
me a fine specimen of this bird, shot close by, in which the 
plumage of the ringtail is still visible on the breast and the 
crown of the head, while all the other parts of the body are 
covered with the plumage of the henharrier.

for the brown owl's note (whether uttered in b flat, as stated 
by White, or not, I am not musician enough to distinguish) 
is a " rural sound " which I always hear with pleasure, 
however uncouth it may sound in " ears polite." Of the 
eared owl I had never a specimen until February last; when 
I had a fine pair sent me, which were killed, in a fir plant- 
ation on the side of one of our mountains, by the gamekeeper 
of B. Hall, Esq. M.P. They are the only pair, I believe, that 
have ever been seen in this neighbourhood. Perhaps I may as 
well make a few remarks in this place respecting 

Eggs of Anomalous Structure, — "We shall here instance 
imperfect eggs sometimes produced, such as want the vitellus, 
and others containing two yolks." (Montagu, on " Eggs of 
Birds," in Rennie's edition of the Diet., p. 166.) " When, from 
the same cause, the growth of the vitellus in the ovarium is too 
luxuriant, two yolks pass the oviduct together; which, being 
surrounded with the usual quantity of albumen, are brought 
forth in the form of a single egg of extraordinary magnitude." 
{Ibid., p. 167.) This irregularity in the state of the eg:^g is not 
of common occurrence amongst birds in their native state, 
but is much more frequent amongst domestic poultry; I

have, however, the egg of a crow, of very diminutive size 
and uncouth shape ; but it had been kept so long before I 
knew of its existence, that its contents were dried up, and, 
consequently, I cannot speak of its internal formation. I have 
also the eggs of the queest [ringdove or wood pigeon], of 
very small size. The nest was taken on the 18th of April; 
and, from the small size of the egg^ I presumed it was that of 
a turtle-dove, although I had never known this bird to visit 
us so early in the season : however, in extracting the contents 
of the eggs, I found that neither of them contained any yolk. 
But, the most irregular itgg that I have at all met with 
is that of a domestic hen. It weighed 1425 grs., and is as 
uncouth in shape as it was extraordinary in size. The shell is 
divided into three compartments or swellings, and contained 
three yolks ; a case not recorded by Montagu in the article 
from which I have already quoted.* [See, in II. 289., a 
statement of the anomalous conditions of a pheasant's egg; 
and, in III. 472., one on those of " an egg within an Ggg^^*

pleasure, appears to be almost as unsettled a matter as the 
cause of their song. " Those who suppose a bird capable of 
producing eggs at will, are certainly mistaken. It will .... 
lay the number allotted by nature, which is determined before 
the first egg is produced. If it is prevented from incubation 
by any means whatever, it may begin again to lay in five or 
six days ; but there is always an interval of a few days, and 
sometimes as many weeks, which must wholly depend on the 

* Mr. Conway had, in a communication -dated May 24. 1833, favoured 
us with a drawing of the anomalous egg of the fowl, and one of that of the 
crow. The drawings are stated to be of the natural size, and exhibit the 
following dimensions and figures : — The drawing of the fowl's egg is 3 in. 
and a tenth and a half in length, and 1 in. and 8 tenths in breadth ; the 
outline is that of an ellipsis, as the two ends are similar in form and 
dimension, but has its curve slightly interrupted in three or four places by 
a just perceptible protrusion, exhibiting, of course, slight prominences in 
these places in the egg itselF. The drawing of the crow's egg is in outline 
a prolate spheroid, or nearly so ; and its longer diameter is scarcely 
9 tenths of an inch, and shorter one full 7 tenths. This extraordinary 
example seems an apposite, and^ we suppose, is an extreme, illustration of 
the accuracy of the remark of Mr. Waterton in VI. 209. ; namely, the eggs 
of the carrion crow are " wonderfully irregular in size and shape and 
colour." Mr. Waterton has also remarked, in VII. 105., that the eggs of 
the rook vary much in colour, shape, and size. — J. D.

age and vigour of the bird." If a nest be robbed, "the female 
stimulates to love again ; and soon brings forward, by that 
stimulus, aided by the male fecundity, a new lot of eggs : 
never more than the former, and usually less." {Ibid., p. 161, 
162.) " After the first egg [in any of the courses of laying, 
Montagu must have meant] is laid, the others must succes- 
sively follow, one after the other, each in twenty-four hours." 
[Ibid., p. 119.) [Montagu has added, " with a few exceptions 
in the larger undomesticated birds ; " and has assumed the 
cuckoo to be another exception, and deemed it possible that 
this bird has the power to retain its mature egg until it has 
found a nest to receive it.] " Another wonderful fact," says 
Jesse {Glecmings in Natural History, series i. p. 193 — 195.), 
" respecting eggs is, that some birds have the property of 
either retaining their egg after it has arrived at maturity, or of 
suppressing altogether the further progress of those eggs which 
had arrived at a certain size in the ovarium ; " and he instances 
the fact in the case of a domestic hen, which, on being removed 
from one location to another, ceased laying, although she had 
already commenced depositing her eggs ; and also in another, 
that had had her leg accidentally broken. " If the peewit is 
deprived of only one egg after she has completed her immber, 
she immediately forsakes the nest : if, however, she has but 
one other to lay, and all but one of her eggs are removed, 
she will continue to lay for ten or twelve days or more. The 
same has been observed of the blackbird, lark, and long- 
tailed titmouse : the latter has gone on to lay as many as 
thirty eggs before she began to sit." [Jesse, p. 191.) To these 
facts I must now add my own observations. Requiring the 
eggs of the brown owl, I desired a neighbouring farmer to 
procure them for me ; but, before they reached me, they 
were destroyed. In about three weeks afterwards, the same 
owl had laid two other eggs in the same nest. A thrush's 
nest was discovered, on a Saturday, with one egg in it; and, 
on Sunday, it was robbed and destroyed. On Monday, a 
new nest was constructed, but very imperfectly, and one egg 
laid in it. During the whole of Tuesday there was no addi- 
tional egg ; but, on Wednesday evening, there were three. 
These facts do not appear to accord [Do not those on the 
brown owl quite accord?] with Montagu's statements as to 
the number of eggs in the second laying, nor as to the time 
in which a bird is forced to bring forth her eggs in succes- 
sion. A friend of mine has some pheasants in captivity ; and 
two hens laid, in one season, ninety-two eggs. Again : a wren, 
under my own observation, built her nest three several times 
in the same hole, in a bank ; but no sooner was it constructed 
Vol. VII. — No. 40. z 



S3 8 Arrival of British Summer Birds, 

than it was destroyed. [See, in No. 41., the details of the 
case of a wryneck ( Yunx Torquilla), whose nest was five times 
disturbed, and the bird thereby excited to produce twenty- 
two eggs.] Now, I argue that she [the wren] would not have 
prepared her nest at all before it was required; and, con- 
sequently, must have been ready to deposit her eggs as soon 
as it was finished. If this supposition be correct, it will then 
follow, if we do not allow the bird the power of retaining 
her eggs at pleasure, that she must have dropped her eggs 
while the second nest was constructing ; but, if this was the 
case, for what purpose was the third nest built ? I should, 
reasoning from analogy, certainly feel inclined to say that the 
exclusion or retention of the egg is no more under the will 
or control of a bird than the exclusion or retention of the 
foetus is subject to the will of a viviparous animal : yet, how 
are we to reconcile this with the facts recorded ? *

By Mr. Edward Blyth. 

The following notes have principally been taken in the 
neighbourhood of Tooting, Surrey, in the course of long 
rambles before breakfast; the country around being greatly 
diversified, and exceedingly well adapted for observations of 
this kind. 

The number of our feathered migrants, this season, appears 
to me greatly to exceed the usual average, at least in the 

* What are we to say to the following remark ? — " The eggs of the 
rook, magpie, and lapwing are nearly similar in size and appearance.** 
(Jesse^ p. 193.) Is it possible that Mr. Jesse had ever seen the egg of the 
lapwing before he made this remark ? Mr. Knapp, however, appears to be 
of somewhat the same opinion ; for he tells us (^Journal of a Naturalisty 
2d ed., p. 262.) " the eggs of the rook, though bearing little resemblance to 
those of the plover (lapwing), are, in some places, not uncommonly taken 
and sold conjointly with them in the London market." Surely, it must be an 
easy matter to impose upon a cockney. — C. C. [Hewitson's British Oology 
will effectually tend to prevent the recurrence of similar errors. In pro- 
motion of its useful service, we give again (we have noticed the work in

We hope that Mr. Hewitson will not omit to give, before his work is 
completed, a dissertation on the structure of eggs, and especially on the 
anomalies in structure which have been observed in them. The condi- 
tions of anomalous formations are, in every class of natural objects, highly 
instructive. See in VI. 430., and in Mr. Conway's communication above.

above-mentioned vicinity. Many species which are always 
common, as the blackcap and the tree pipit, are now more 
than usually abundant; whilst others, which in general are 
here comparatively rare, as the redstart, and the grasshopper 
warbler, are this season far from being so. Perhaps this 
may be in some degree attributable to the long continuance 
of fine weather, during the period of migration ; which is 
assuming that, in general, many perish by the way; but, 
unfortunately for this explanation, there is also a consi- 
derable increase of several of our resident birds, especially 
of buntings (ikfiliaria), green grosbeaks, and common linnets. 
Owing to the unusual mildness of last winter, very few gold- 
crests arrived from the north ; and these little birds, only, I 
think, are now not quite so abundant here as they were last 
summer. 

The first of the migratory species which made its appear- 
ance here this season was the blackcap (Curruca Atricapilla), 
three or four of which were seen about some privet bushes 
on the 23d of March, and on several following days, sub- 
sisting on the berries, and pouring forth their lively melody 
from amid a clump of shrubs, then every morning thickly 
incrusted with hoar frost. They did not become common 
till April 2. or 3.* April 11. A blackcap was, this morning, 
seen carrying in its bill materials for nidification. 

March 29th, On this day a meadow crake (or landrail, 
Crex pratensis) alighted on board the Farquharson, East 
Indiaman (as I was informed by a relation, one of the passen- 
gers), as she was nearing the English coast. These birds 
are not common in this neighbourhood, and I did not hear 
their cry until the 13th of April. I heard them again on 
the 16th. 

April 2d. I was informed by a birdcatcher, on whom I 
think I can depend, that he had just seen a redstart. Though 
I frequently examined their haunts, I did not myself notice 
one for some time afterwards. Could this have been JPhoeni- 
curus Tithys ? 

Wheatears are, here, rather rare, and the first I saw was 
on the 3d of April. They were, doubtless, in the country 
at least a fortnight before. 

4th. This morning a solitary swallow (iiirundo rustica) 
was seen, and bank martins (//. riparia) were plentiful about 
the river Wandle. These last had been over some days.f

Tree pipits (^^nthus arboreus), also, arrived on April 4., 
being the same day on which I have first noticed them for 
three successive years. The following day they were abun- 
dant. Speaking of the genus ^'nthus, Mr. Selby observes, 
that the species " appear subject to a trifling change of plumage 
in the spring, confined principally to the region of the head 
and throat." From observations which I have made on these 
birds, both in confinement and in the wild state, I find that 
the members of this genus, and also of Budytes and Motacilla, 
undergo in the spring a complete change of plumage, with 
the exception of the quill and tail feathers. Even the wing 
coverts and the scapulars are all changed. 

6th. I heard a wryneck (Yunx Torquilla), on Clap- 
ham Common : on the 7th these were very plentiful. [In 
1833, the wryneck was heard at Bury St. Edmunds on 
April 7.] 

7th. A single chimney swallow was seen, being probably 
the same individual that was noticed on April 4. Observed 
several willow wrens (Sylvia Trochilus), and chiffchafFs 
(S. loquax). These last have generally been described to 
come over in the middle of March ; but I rather question 
whether those that have migrated are ever heard before the 
first week in April. Two chiffchaffs remained throughout 
last winter in Earl Spencer's park at Wimbledon. In the 
Field Naturalisfs Magazine for last April, p. 217., a corre- 
spondent from Penzance mentions that a few willow wrens 
remain in that neighbourhood throughout the year ; and as, 
in a previous communication, he makes mention of the chifF- 
chafF, he is doubtless correct with regard to the species. 

10th. Heard, for the first time, this morning the long 

Taunton, March 29. Swallows appeared, on April 7., at Dorchester ; and 
at Stanley Green, on April 19. There were, on May 1., martins hatched, 
and full fledged, at Spalding, Lincolnshire ; and martins were building at 
Stanley Green on May 2. The Rev. W. O. Bartlett, Vicar of Great Can- 
ford, near Wimborne, Dorsetshire, saw twelve swallows in that parish on 
Oct. 29. 1833. The last swallows seen here, in the parish of Longfleet, 
were two seen by Mr. A. Kemp, on Nov. 15. A brood of martins, the 
produce of a second hatch, had taken flight two days before. After various 
rehearsals, which were very interesting to observe, the young birds departed 
with a number of old ones which had assisted in teaching their young wings, 
as well as ideas, "to shoot" through the air. Very few birds return, I 
think, from their migration. I notice two martins which frequently visit 
the old nest where the brood I have named was reared, but there is not, 
at present, any attempt to rebuild it : their acts seem more like a remini- 
scential inspection. This nest was in an apple loft ; their egress and regress 
was, last year, through a window then open ; but, observing that, on their 
arrival this spring, they dashed themselves against the glass, I removed a 
pane, and now two birds frequently fly in and out ; but only two. — W. B.

trill of the grasshopper warbler (Salicaria Locustella), or, as it 
is better named by the peasantry in these parts, '' the cricket 
bird," or the " rattlesnake bird ; " the former, of course, 
from the similarity of its cry to that of the mole cricket 
(Gryllotalpa), and the latter (by which term it is here most 
generally known) from the equally close resemblance which 
it bears to the rattle of the Crotalus [rattlesnake] ; though it 
is difficult to imagine how this should be sufficiently well 
known [in England] to give rise to a provincial name. 
April 10. was also the day on which I heard it for the first 
time last year. I did not this season again notice it till the 
17th, about which time they appeared in considerable numbers. 
On the first arrival of this curious species, it sedulously hides 
in the very densest furze or bramble coverts, rarely emits its 
strange sibilous rattle, and even then its voice hardly ever 
seems to proceed from the true direction. This ventriloquis- 
ing faculty (as it is absurdly called) is well known. The 
bird can, at pleasure, send forth (as it were) its voice to the 
distance of two or three yards ; so that, by merely turning 
round its head, the sound often appears to be shifted to 
double that distance. The same effect is produced also in 
the common meadow crake, and in precisely the same manner, 
by a mere turn of the head. As soon as the cricket birds, 
however, have fixed their abode, and the females begin to 
arrive, the males cease for a time to exercise this faculty, and 
for a very obvious reason ; otherwise, were five or six of them 
to be emulously trilling in a furze brake, as is frequently the 
case, the female would often be sent in a wrong direction, 
and might, it is not unlikelv, introduce herself to one of the 
rivals : but this the males take care to prevent, not only by 
ceasing to ventriloquise, but by sitting exposed on the top- 
most twigs of the bushes, and rattling so loudly that they 
may be heard at a very great distance. They are then so 
bold, that, even if shot at and missed, they fly only for two 
or three yards, and then recommence immediately, as if no- 
thing had happened. No sooner, however, are they paired, 
than their habit of close concealment returns, and also their 
deceptive mode of uttering their cry. Having lately pro- 
cured a considerable number of these birds for different 
friends, I have observed that they vary somewhat in plumage, 
some being much spotted on the breast, while others are 
spotless, and the colour of the upper parts also varying a 
little in different individuals; but there is no fixed difference 
between the plumage of the sexes. I have often been sur- 
prised at the great strength of the muscles of the leg in this 
species, which are partly ossified, as in gallinaceous birds.

342 Arrival of British Summer Birds, 

13th. A cuckoo was heard. * 

14-th. Yellow field wagtails (Budytes flava, or better, 
perhaps, flavissima) were seen, and the next morning these 
were very plentiful. I once had the gratification of seeing a 
small flock of these birds arrive from the sea, early one morn- 
ing in September, while shooting seafowl in the Isle of Jersey. 
They were of this species, and not the nearly allied one lately 
detected by Mr. Gould, and had probably crossed from the 
south-western coast of England, f

ming over the meadows by the river Wandle. A redstart

was heard here for the first time in the season, being the 
same day on which I first noticed it last year. 

18th. Whinchats arrived ; a reed warbler (»Salicaria arun- 
dinacea) was shot; and I was told that a garden fauvette 
(Curruca hortensis) had been heard. Redwings and field- 
fares were still abundant, but from this time their numbers 
rapidly decreased. 

19th. Several whitethroats made their appearance, and on 
the following day these were very plentiful. 

20th. I saw a grey flycatcher (Muscicapa Grisola): this 
being about ten days before the usual period of its first 
appearance. 

* [The cuckoo was first heard at Parkstone, near Poole [Dorsetshire], 
on April 18. 1834 : it came on the same day in 1833 ; and I am told by 
persons who are observant, that it always returns, and is first heard 
at Parkstone, about that day. One cuckoo, last year, which haunted 
my garden, was known by its voice: it was cracked; and the bird, during 
its twelve weeks' stay, never recovered its hoarseness ; it could only cry, 
cuck, cuck. I have ascertained that this bird has not returned, or 
else has made good use of its winter holidays in learning to speak plain. 
The cuckoo left us last year on July 8. Which way does this bird retreat ? 
I have heard its note very often between Bruges and Ghent, so late as the 
end of July : especially, also, near Ostend. — W. B. Clarke ^ May 19. 1834.

[f Wagtails arrived at Stanley Green [Dorsetshire] on March 6. These 
birds built last year in a small brick island, covered with shrubs, in a fish- 
pond in my orchard. At least ten pairs left us in October ; two only have 
returned. They have not built there this spring, as the gardener has 
cleared away the weeds, &c. ; and the birds seem alarmed. W. B. Clarke. 
May 19. 1834. — We have appended this observation, because, although 
Mr. Clarke has not stated the species, it would seem to be not the common 
resident one ; and because it is so clear an illustration of the remark by 
Mr. Waterton, in VI. 312. ; namely, the means of " food, and a quiet 
retreat, are the two best offers that man can make to the feathered race, to 
induce them to take up their abode on his domain."]

21st. Sedge warblers tolerably plentiful. 

23d. Common swifts (Cypselus murarius) arrived. Also 
the white-breasted fauvette, or lesser whitethroat (Curruca 
garrula). This species is rather irregular in its appearance, 
and Montagu extends the period of its arrival " from April 2 1 , 
to May 10." In the spring of 1831, its nest, containing four 
eggs, was brought to me on the 23d of April. Last year I 
did not observe it till the beginning of May. Here it is very 
abundant; and I may avail myself of the present opportunity 
to offer a few remarks on the species. 

It is certainly strange, that so common a bird as this is, an 
inhabitant of gardens and orchards, and roadsides, in the 
immediate vicinity of houses, and conspicuous from its rest- 
less activity, and its perpetual reiteration of a loud and pecu- 
liar note, should be so little known to naturalists as very 
generally to be considered rare; and be described, by all our 
writers on ornithology, to inhabit only the thickest under- 
wood ; yet such is the case : and, even in the late edition of 
Mr. Selby's work, it is said to inhabit " the thickest hedges, in 
which it conceals itself with great adroitness; and the in- 
tricacies of which it threads with the rapidity of a mouse ; on 
which account, specimens are only to be obtained with diffi- 
culty, and by patient watching." And, again : — " Its retired 
habits, and the impatience of observation which it so con- 
stantly exhibits, in always ensconcing itself amidst the thickest 
entanglements of hedges or underwood," &c. The words, 
also, of Mr. Mudie, in his Feathered Tribes, are to the same 
purport, representing it to keep much closer to the hedges 
than the common whitethroat. Much of this is, however, 
erroneous ; for the haunts of this bird are not much in the 
hedgerow nor in the tangled underwood, but more upon the 
trees than those of the whitethroat, and not unfrequently on 
the tops of the highest elms : whence its shrill and monotonous 
concluding note (which much resembles the song of the cirl 
bunting, or the sound jV^, or gheei, repeated several times in 
quick succession) may be heard at a considerable distance. 
I have noticed it to be particularlj^ partial to elms ; so much 
so, that, when rambling through different parts of the country, 
I have approached a spot where a few elms have grown out 
of the hedge, and especially if a ditch were at their feet, I 
have often, as a matter of course, looked out for this active 
little bird, and scarcely remember an instance of failing to see 
it in such situations. It may almost always be observed, also, 
about little cottage gardens ; and, when the cherries begin to 
ripen, no species is more eager in its attacks upon them ; nor 
are its habits so retired, nor its impatience of observation so 

z 4 



344 Arrival of British Summer Birds, 

great, but that it will allow of a tolerably near approach ; 
nearer, indeed, than any of its British congeners. It some- 
times places its nest 10 ft. or 12 ft. from the ground ; but more 
commonly in low bushes, and not unfrequently among nettles 
or other coarse herbage : whence, in these parts, this bird 
(and not the whitethroat) has acquired the provincial name of 
" nettle creeper;" by which term it is mostly known to the 
peasantry. 

The lesser whitethroat differs remarkably, in confinement, 
from all its British congeners, in the extreme quarrelsomeness 
of its disposition ; resembling, in this respect, the willow wren 
and chiffchaff. I have noticed this, in a greater or lesser 
degree, in upwards of a dozen individuals ; and, in general, 
they must not, on this account, be kept with other birds, or 
they will fairly worry them to death, even if double or triple 
their own size, as I have reason to know from experience. Its 
manners in the cage (though not its attitudes) bear a very near 
resemblance to those of the furze wren, or Dartford warbler 
(Melizophilus provincialis). Both these little birds have, in 
confinement, a remarkable habit of often throwing back the 
head ; and they frequently cHmb along the wires, which none 
of our other warblers ever do. They farther assimilate in 
being puffy and thick of feathers about the neck and throat ; 
and in sometimes uttering a kind of rattling note, peculiar to 
themselves. In other respects, however, the furze wren ap- 
proximates more to the whitethroat than it does to this species ; 
and, in confinement, is as fond of fruit as either of these. Its 
general habits, in the wild state, are quite those of the white- 
throat ; and its manner of singing on the wing precisely the 
same ; its bill, also, is very similar to that of the whitethroat : 
yet I now incline to the opinion that the furze wren forms a 
distinct natural genus from these, taking the blackcap for the 
standard of Curruca; and consider our two whitethroats as 
species in some degree intermediate, these differing, however, 
considerably from each other. The furze wren, in its mode of 
nidification and eggs, very closely resembles the whitethroat 
and other fauvettes ; and not the Maliiri, to which genus it, in 
some other respects, also very nearly approximates. 

The lesser whitethroat is never observed to mount singing 
into the air, like the common species ; but pours forth its 
pretty chirping song generally from amid the branches of a 
tree, though sometimes from a bush. This is soft and melo- 
dious, but weak ; and may be easily recognised by the fre- 
quent recurrence of a note like sip, sip, sip. Like the other 
fauvettes (Curruca), it raises its voice as it proceeds, and ends 
generally with the monotonous and loud shrill note mentioned 



mth incidental Remarks, 345 

at the commencement of this account ; which is analogous to 
the clear and lively whistle with which the blackcap usually 
concludes. This note is also sometimes repeated, as it flies, 
in a vacillating manner, from tree to tree. 

In the young of this species the colour of the iris is very 
dark, appearing at first sight black ; the following spring it 
becomes hazel, with a tinge of i*eddish ; the next year it is 
pale olive brown ; gradually becoming lighter and lighter, 
till at length it is of the purest white. In this state I have 
kept in confinement a fine male, and have since seen another 
individual, a female, in which theirides were perfectly colour- 
less. They are seldom thus met with, because so many years 
must elapse before the colour entirely disappears ; and in all 
birds there is always a great preponderance of young indi- 
viduals. Montagu's description must have been taken from 
one three j^ears old ; as the irides are said to be " yellowish, 
with a tinge of pearl colour." In the males of the common 
whitethroat, the iris does not acquire its rich yellow until 
the second or third year. [I have, this morning, shot one 
with white irides. [Mr, BlytJi, in a letter dated May 30.)] 

I hope this long digression will be pardoned. I have been 
thus diffuse, because the lesser whitethroat seems but very 
partially known, judging from most of the descriptions of it 
which I have hitherto seen. Of these, that in Professor 
Rennie's edition of Montagu's Dictionary is decidedly the 
best, the editor being well acquainted with the bird. 

26th. Heard the sibilous pettychaps (or wood wren, Sylvia 
sibilatrix) for the first time. 

30th. On this day I was informed, that, among the numer- 
ous swifts playing around the Garrat copper mills, on the 
Wandle, was one individual of a larger size, and rather 
paler than the rest, with a white line along the belly. This 
I immediately recognised to be Cypselus alpinus [described 
in VI. 286, 287.], so took my gun, and went direct in 
search of it ; but, ere I arrived at the place, all the swifts had 
disappeared. 

May 3d. Did not hear the garden fauvette (Curriica 
hortensis) until now. In an excursion, on May 8., over 
Penge Woods, near Sydenham, I observed this species to 
be more abundant than I had ever known it before. For 
miles, the whole neighbourhood was vocal with their deep 
and mellow warblings. They did not here become common 
till about this time. Grey flycatchers were now plentiful. 

5lh. The common flusher (Colliirio vulgaris) made its 
appearance ; and the turtle dove was first heard. A finished 
dove's nest was found on the 18th. Though the turtle dove

is common in Dulwich woods, and in several other places 
near the metropolis, it is here of rather rare occurrence ; and 
I have not, therefore, perhaps, been able to note down the 
exact time of its arrival. 

I had now for some days been rather anxious to procure 
an alpine swift, for as many as three or four were one day 
seen sailing in company with the common species. I went 
several times to the place, and once I certainly saw them, 
but they were sailing high in the air, far out of the reach of 
gunshot. It was a calm still evening, and the spectacle af- 
forded by the swallow tribes was truly beautiful, and would 
interest any lover of natural history. jF/irundo rupestris ex- 
cepted, all the European /:rirundinid8e (or Cypselidse, should 
they not rather be called ?) were sailing around. With 
pinions wide-extended, the two swifts (Cypselus murarius 
and alpinus) glided rapidly along in bold and sweeping curves, 
now buoyantly floating on the breeze, now darting with the 
speed of thought in pursuit of each other ; those of the com- 
mon species screaming in their course. The swallows {H. rus- 
tica) skimmed the surface of the water, at times excursively 
ranging over the adjoining meadows, and uttering, as they 
passed, their well-known " peet-weet," so exactly imitated 
by the little sedge bird. The house martins {H. urbica) sailed 
gracefully in easy curves, with wings extended, twittering 
forth in the air their brisk and cheerful song ; and showing in 
beautiful contrast, as they neared the ground, their purest 
snow-white plumage above the tail. Lastly, though far more 
numerous than all the rest together, the little sand martins, 
{H. riparia), with flight more vacillating than the others, li- 
terally peopled the air with their numbers, and, in colour 
widely differing from the rest, displayed their brown vestures 
to advantage, as they passed before a clump of trees, then 
everywhere budding forth into leaf. 

It was impossible not to gaze with admiration on this ani- 
mated scene. Their numbers seemed to lessen ; and presently 
hardly one could be discerned, where a minute before they so 
abounded: but soon, in the distance, a few moving specks 
were visible, and in another minute the air was peopled as 
before. Again they disappeared, and the scene again was every- 
where enlivened by their presence ; but not in such numbers 
as at first The sun was fast sinking below the horizon, and 
in every direction the refulgent sky glowed with his setting 
beams. The swifts had disappeared : a few swallows and 
house martins were still sailing around, their numbers fast 
decreasing : the bank martins gradually, almost imperceptibly, 
mounted higher and higher into the air, rising somewhat at

every sweep ; and, slowly congregating in their ascent, con- 
tinued thickening in numbers and lessening in the distance, 
till at length, '^ parvis componere magna!'' [to compare great 
things to small], they assumed exactly the appearance of a 
swarm of flies. At last they vanished to the westward ; but 
whither they pursued their route I cannot tell, though I sup- 
pose that they retired straight to roost among the osier beds 
beside the Thames. 

Mr. Selby observes of the bank martin, that he is not aware 
whether they ever congregate in the autumn, like the other 
species, previous to their migration. They certainly do con- 
gregate, and in tens of thousands, the flocks sometimes alight- 
ing on the ground ; and generally passing the night in large 
beds of reeds or osiers. 

Last of all the summer birds of passage, arrived the night-jar 
(Nychtichelidon europae^us), the loud hurre of which was first 
heard here on May 15. This is early ; but they may possibly 
have arrived a little before, as they are not common in this 
immediate neighbourhood, though a few always make their 
appearance. They are plentiful in the Coombe district; and 
I have seen them in Dulwich woods, and upon Penge Com- 
mon, within five miles of London.* 

To conclude : I did not, this season, observe any ring ousels, 
nor pied flycatchers f (M. luctuosa). The former usually make 
their appearance here about the middle of April ; the latter 
in the early part of that month, being one of the first summer 
birds of passage. Query, Should this species, and albicollis, 
range in the same minimum division as M. Grisola P 

The noting down the arrivals of our small summer visitants 
has become a subject rather destitute of novelty ; but it is still 
interesting to compare observations made in different parts 
of the kingdom ; and, with this view, I have been induced to 
offer the present communication.

* [The nightjar was heard at Stanley Green on May 15. : it had probably 
just arrived. It has no regular habitat here, as far as I am informed. 
The bird arrived seems to be a solitary individual ; at least I have not seen 
its mate. It made a fearful clatter on the 15th and 17th, from 7 o'clock 
in the evening until midnight. It was silent on the 1 6th, in the evening of 
which day it was hovering about the garden. (W. B. Clarkcy in a communi-

in the identical hole (of a large ivied poplar), in which three successive

persevering attachment to a particular location, for I have no doubt what-

sponge ; the margin thickish, plain, undulate, free, and suf- 
ficiently broad to conceal the foot when at rest. Tentacula 
arising between the cloak and veil, superior, two, cylindrical, 
short, formed of a membrane folded into a tube slit along one 
side. Eyes two, small, black ; one at the superior base of each 
tentaculum. Veil above the mouth broad, somewhat triangular, 
produced at the upper and outer angles, which are folded. 
Mouth shortly proboscidiform. Space between the cloak and 
foot smooth, deep. Orifice of the generative organs on the 
right side, placed very forward, tubercle-like. Branchia arising 
immediately behind it, single, naked, plume-like, and pectin- 
ated ; the posterior half free. Foot oval, tapering posteriorly 
when in a state of extension, and projecting beyond the 
cloak ; the margins undulate, plain. Shell concealed in the 
substance of the cloak, dorsal, ovate-oblong, depressed, with 
a minute spire at one end; brownish, thin, pellucid; strongly 
wrinkled concentrically, and marked with a slight fossa from 
the apex to the opposite angle. Length 6 lines, breadth 3 J lin. 

I am unable to describe the internal organisation of this 
interesting mollusc; but it may be permitted me to direct 
the student's attention to the wonderful structure of its oral 
organs, which I could not (although not unfamiliar with ana- 
logous structures in congenerous species) view without a 
feeling of indescribable pleasure and amazement : and, to the 
lovers of the microscope, I am satisfied that no object can 
afford a more gratifying display. Within the soft parts of the 
mouth there lie two thin oval plates, one on each side, reti- 
culated in an inconceivably minute and regular manner, after 
the fashion of the compound eyes of many insects ; the meshes 
being diamond-shaped, and set with a small obtuse process at 
each angle. Between these plates (which, I presume, are a 
modification of the maxillae or jaws) the tongue is situated : 
a broad membrane, folded at the sides, and armed with innu- 
merable litde spines or teeth, arranged in close-set transverse 
series, parting from a longitudinal medial line. The tongue 
is of a square shape, rounded at the lower end ; to which is 
appended an inversely heart-shaped piece of similar structure 
and appearance : the whole fitted to rasp down the vegetable 
matter on which the animal feeds. 

The cloak is fleshy, but not fibrous ; and, in its composition, 
includes many small crystalline spicula of carbonate of lime, 
which are also to be found in the foot and branchia. These 
spicula are colourless, short, cylindrical, and rounded at both 
ends ; and they seem to have no determinate arrangement. 
I have found similar spicula, but larger and more abundantly, 
in the tegumentary system of the D6ri6'. 



350 Desciiption of some nondescript and rare 

Our figures exhibit the animal of its natural size; and 
were taken from specimens found, between tide-marks, in 
Berwick Bay. Like the land slug, it progresses by obscure, 
undulatory motions of the foot ; but it justly claims the " bad 
preeminence " of being superior in sluggishness and tardiness. 

The specific name of Blainville is unjustifiable ; and no 
authority can warrant our adoption of it. Montagu (the 
discoverer of the species) called it Bulla plumula * ; and, 
although the generic name must be altered to suit the progress 
of science, his specific name is sacred, and is beyond the 
changeful caprice of any systematist. Blainville has done 
some further wrong to Montagu, in ascribing even the dis- 
covery of the mollusc to Donovan ; whose name, I may 
observe, is often substituted for that of the former naturalist 
by foreign authors, and by some careless translators in our 
own country. Bermck upon Tweedy Jan, 3. 1834<. 




Art. VIII. Description of some nondescript and rare British Species 
of Shells. By William Turton, Esq. M.D. &c. 

Crena'tula Travi's// [Turton]. {Jig, 47.) 

Testa rhombea, inferne rotundata, pellucida, albida vittis 
longitudinalibus interruptis pallide violaceis ; margine antico 
incurvato. 

Shell rhombic, rounded below, transparent, whitish, with 
pale, violet, longitudinal, interrupted stripes; the anterior 
margin incurved. Nearly an inch long, and full half an inch 
broad ; extremely thin and brittle ; obliquely truncate at the 
top, with a few pale violet spots below ; hollowed out at the 
front margin in a slight crescent-shaped form. 

This most interesting addition to our native stock was 
taken alive at Scarborough; and is in the cabinet of Mr. 
Bean, who obligingly sent the accurate drawing from which 
the figure was taken. He has given it the specific name of 
TraviszV, after Mr. Travis, well known for his valuable com- 
munications to Pennant. In its outline, it differs from any 
of those figured by Sowerby, or described by Lamarck.

rous slight longitudinal ribs, which are crossed by transverse depressed 
lines, giving them a granulated surface : the front margin a little incurved ; 
the hinge margin angular. 

This beautiful species, which has long been a desideratum 
to the science, was taken in abundance, by Mr. Bean, on 
some floating wood at Scarborough, who kindly sent us 
some specimens. [See, in connection, the communication in 
p. 353.] 

Pleuro'toma TREVELLTA^NZJii/ [Turtou]. 

Testa ovato-fusiforme ; anfractibus 6 — 7, striis numerosissimis, apice 
deplanatis. 

Shell oval-fusiform ; with 6 or 7 volutions, very closely striate, and 
flattened at their tops. 

This new and very distinct species was found, by Mr. 
Bean, abundantly at Scarborough. It is so extremely like 
the JVfurex turricula of Montagu, as to be hardly distin- 
guished, except by the following marks: — 1st, The outline 
is of a more inflated cast ; 2dly, the striae are twice as nume- 
rous ; 3dly, and the distinct notch at the upper angle of the 
outer lip fixes its genus. 

In this genus we have also the ilfurex gracilis, M. sept- 
angularis, and M. linearis of Montagu, and the M. Chordula 
of our Conchological Dictionary ; a pair of which, collected by 
ourselves, are now in the cabinet of Mr. Clark. 

The M. purpureus of Montagu has sometimes this pleuro- 
tomatic notch. 

Fu^sus fenestraVus \_Turton], 

Testa oblongo-fusiformi, alba, costis numerosis longitudinalibus striis 
transversis reticulatis ; anfractibus octo, tumidis ; cauda producta, sinis- 
trorsum curva ; apice papillari ; fauce albo laevigato. 

Shell oblong-fusiform, white, with numerous longitudinal ribs, which are 
reticulate by transverse striae ; volutions eight, swollen ; the tail produced, 
a little turned to the left ; mouth white, smooth ; the tip papillary. 

Length, 1^ in. ; breadth, five eighths of an inch. In its outline it much 
resembles the Fusus corneus ; but the volutions are much more rounded 
and deeply divided, and the tail is not so much elongated j the reticulations 
are rather coarse, and slightly granular at the points of junction; the 
colour is also of a much clearer ivory white. 

A pair of these were dredged up at Cork ; one of which 
was sent to us by Mr. Humphries, and is now in the cabinet 
of Mr. Clark.

Testa laevi, eburnea ; anfractibus planiusculis ; ultimo ventricoso ; labro 
dilatato, intus laevigato. 

Shell quite smooth, ivory white ; volutions rather flat, the lower one 
ventricose ; outer lip much dilated, and smooth on the inner margin. 

Length 5 in., and about 2 in. broad j with six volutions, the last of which 
is much enlarged ; of an ivory whiteness, with a slight ferruginous stain ; 
aperture very large, twice as long as the rest of the shell, pure white

This fine shell was taken by the dredge, off Scarborough ; 
and is in the cabinet of Mr. Bean, who obligingly sent it to 
us for examination and description. 

TRiVoiV^ CUTA^CEUS L., Sowcrbi/, Gen, fig. 3. 

Testa ovata, dorso tumido, subtus deplanata, cingulis transversis pro- 
minulis subnodosis, varicibus duabus, nodosis, alternis; columella um- 
bilicata ; labro intus serie duplici crenato. 

Shell oval, tumid on the back and flat underneath, with transverse and 
rather prominent belts, which are slightly nodulous ; varices two, knotty 
and alternate ; pillar umbilicate, outer lip crenulate internally in a double 
row. 

Length nearly 3 in., and half as much wide ; yellowish white, pure white 
within J pillar with a small nodule near the upper end. 

Three or four of these shells were cast on shore, after a 
violent gale, near Falmouth, in Cornwall ; and we have taken 
them on the Guernsey coast. From their worn and much 
stained state, they appear to have come from very remote and 
deep water. 

? Ia''nthina exi'gua So'is^erhy Gen. fig. 2, 3. 

Testa ovata, subfusiformi, bifariam striata, spira producta acuta. 

Shell oval, a little swollen in the middle, striate in a double direction \ 
the spire produced and pointed. 

Length four tenths of an inch, three tenths broad ; of a violet colour, 
and a more conical shape than L fragilis, in consequence of the spire being 
more produced, and the volutions rounded and more distinctly defined j 
the mouth is also not so proportionately spread, by which it appears of a 
somewhat spindle-like form, the primary volution being swollen and slightly 
carinate in the middle ; the striae are very distinct and elegant, oblique, 
and turning at the subcarinate part in an obtusely angular direction. 

In the small coves about the Land's End, in Cornwall, the 
? lanthina fragilis is occasionally wafted, by a gentle south- 
west wind, in prodigious fleets ; all alive, and borne upon the 
water by their clusters of tough bubble-like vesicles. By the 
retreating waves, most of them are carried back into the 
ocean ; so that it requires a fortunate combination of tide, 
wind, and wave to see them in all their splendour. This 
mostly happens about the months of July and August. The 
fishermen's wives call them bullhorns, which supposes a prior 
knowledge of their appearance. Among them are sometimes 
found a few of I. exigua; which, having been probably regarded 
as the young of 1. fragilis, may have caused them to be over- 
looked. 

Bu'lla zona^ta \Turton\ Scaphander Leach, 

Testa ovata, solida, opaca, albo et fulvo alternatim zonata, lineis trans- 
versis elevato-punctulatis. 

Shell oval, solid, opaque, with alternate zones of white and fulvous, and 
transverse lines of minute raised dots. 

Length a quarter of an inch, breadth nearly as much. 



Hare British Mytilus. 353 

This very elegant species in shape very much resembles 
a small B. lignaria ; but is of a more conic oval shape, with 
the volutions more loosely connected ; the crown is umbili- 
cated, and, togethei- with the pillar, pure white. On the body 
are regular, rather broad, alternate, transverse bands of white 
and pale rufous brown ; and round each of the white belts is 
a regular line of very minute raised granular dots. 

Found near the Land's End. (Mus, Clark,) 

Bu'lla hya^lina lT'urto7i'], Roxania Leach, 
Testa ovata, hyalina, laevi,* aperture basi clilatata; columella umbilicata ; 
corona planata, canaliculata, umbonata. 

Shell oval, transparent, smooth; apertura dilated at the base; pillar 
umbilicate ; crown flattened, channelled, umbonate. 

It something resembles the Bulla umbilicjita; but is shorter, and of a 
more oval shape, with the aperture more dilated, and is of a crystalline 
transparency. At the base of the inner margin there is a reflection of the 
pillar, forming a slight groove or umbilicus ; and the central umbo on the 
crown is very distinct and prominent. The last two marks seem to fix it 
in the genus Cjmba of Lamarck and Sowerby; but we have not remarked 
the sharp plaits on the pillar. 

Found abundantly on the coast about Newcasde; whence it 
was sent us by Mr. Alder. We also discovered it near the 
Land's End, in Cornwall. (Mus. Alder, Clark.) 

Bull^'a puncta'ta [7>/r/o?z], Bulla punctata Adams, Linn, 
T7^ans. vi. t. i. fig. 6, ?> 8. 

Testa ovata, hyalina, lineis transversis impresso-punctatis ; corona 
canaliculata. 

Shell oval, transparent, with transverse lines of distinct impressed dots. 

The accurate observations of Mr. Clark, who favoured us 
with specimens, have fully distinguished this species from 
B. catena of Montagu. The shell is something smaller, of a 
more oval shape, with the crown more flattened ; and, instead 
of oval, raised, chainlike points, which form the lines in B. 
catena, the lines in this species consist of distinct impressed dots. 

Mr. Clark has also been able to ascertain, that, in B. ca- 
tena, the animal is of a yellowish white, and furnished with 
a gizzard; but that the animal of B. punctata is of a blackish 
grey colour, and destitute of any trace of gizzard.

eastern coasts of Yorkshire and Durham, and has been ar- 
ranged under the different names of M. aDgulatus and M, 
soHtarius. Nothing has, however, been known of its habits, 
in consequence of the specimens (which have been generally 
found attached to the roots of seaweeds) being so rare, and 
all of them young ones, until lately, when a habitat of this 
species was discovered a little to the north of Scarborough. 
The only other species to which it bears any resemblance 
are the M. edulis and the M. incurvatus, both of which are 
found in the neighbourhood. In the drawing [fig» 48 ), a is a 




lateral representation of a full grown shell, and d is the 
anterior margin of the same. From the M. edulis, to which 
it approaches in size, it differs in the greater thickness of the 
shell, which is strong and solid; the hinge-line is longer, and 
very straight, giving rather a rhomboidal form to the valves, 
sometimes even more so than in the figures; while in the 
M. edulis it is curved ; the anterior margin is broad, de- 
pressed, and a little convex, instead of being produced ; the 
lines of growth are also comparatively stronger. In form, it 
bears a greater resemblance to the M. incurvatus ; but the 
latter wants the straight hinge-line, and is not of half the 
size. The young shells {h and c) have the character of the 
hinge even more striking, and are of a deep brown colour, 
instead of the dirty blue of the old ones. Still stronger

points of distinction between these three species are supplied 
by the differences in their habits. The M. edulis is found 
thickly clustered on the large flat scars, and the M. in- 
curvatus fills the crevices and fissures of the rocks : the 
species which is the subject of my notice is invariably, except 
in the solitary instances to which I have above alluded, laid 
under water. It is found in the large pools left by the retir- 
ing tide, in groups of three or four together, firmly attached 
by their strong byssus to the under surfaces of the large stones 
with which the water is here and there studded ; so that, to 
procure them, it is necessary to wade into the pools, and 
overturn these stones. 

Mr. J. Alder of Newcastle has arranged it under the name 
of Myi\\\\s angulatus ; and the Rev. W. Mark of Shields 
calls it M, solitarius ; but the largest individuals which these 
gentlemen have ever seen are less than the smaller figures 
[b and c) ; and as the shells of all muscles are more or less 
angular, and as this is not a species of a solitary habit, I 
would propose the name of M. subsaxatilis, as most charac- 
teristic of the situations in which it is found. The charac- 
ters of its habitat, combined with its peculiar solid form, 
give it as good a title to be styled a distinct species as, if 
not a better one than, that of the transparent shell of the 
M. pellucidus, or the small blunted form of the shell of the 
M. incurvatus, does these species respectively.

356 Observations on Madame Merian's 

remarks which I have been able to make on the value and 
interest of her figures, during my residence in a country similar 
to that in which her collections were formed. 

We can never sufficiently admire the zeal of this female 
votary of the sciences, who, quitting the comforts of her home, 
sought for two years the gratification of her curiosity in a far 
distant land, under a burning sun, and in an unwholesome 
climate : her book, however, abounds widi errors, against 
which the naturalist of Europe should be always upon his 
guard. At the period in which it was issued from the press, 
1726 (according to Kirby, an edition seems to have been 
published as early as 1705), it was considered a splendid and 
valuable addition to the libraries of the learned; and it con- 
tinues still to be admired, from the size of its showy plates, 
and the beauty of the subjects depicted, though the state of 
entomological engraving in 1726 was very imperfect ; and the 
figures are sadly deficient in that minuteness of detail which 
is indispensable. 

Its principal value seems to me to consist in the figures of 
larvae and pupae. Much fault is to be found with the absurd 
position of many of the figures, and the very great inaccuracy 
of others : indeed, it is difficult to imagine how they could 
have been prepared, unless they were sketched from memory. 
The grand defect of the work is the introduction of idle stories, 
related to her by strangers. The " paucis solum exceptis, 
quae ex ore Indorum percepta junxi," go far to destroy that 
confidence which would naturally be given to a patient ob- 
server of nature. Linne, and some others of the older writers, 
have been led to give very inapplicable names to various 
species of Lepidoptera, taken from the plants on which they 
are falsely represented to have fed. 

I shall pass on to notice the plates, which are 72 in 
number, .and at the end of each note will say something 
as to the value of the figure of the plant introduced. The 
plates are preceded by one of those fanciful and useless 
frontispieces which were formerly thought indispensable in 
an illustrated work, and which occupied, to no purpose, the

represented, in the foreground, before a basket of tropical 
fruits, with her attendants placing in cabinets chip boxes 
filled with extended insects ; while the room is swarming 
with a host of butterflies and caterpillars that would have 
frightened Pharaoh in the land of Egypt. In the distance is 
a Surinam landscape swarming with frogs, in which we behold 
two old gentlemen, in bag wigs and broad-tailed coats, assist- 
ing the maid-servant to capture flies. 

Plate 1. contains, on the right side, three rude and useless 
figures of BMxiia americana Gmelin, Lin, 2042. At the 
bottom, the circular egg purse {theca) of a spider is mistaken 
for the inartificial egg cell [loculns) oF the kakkerlac or cock- 
roach, out of which a young one is represented as escaping. 
On the left are two useless figures of a second species, hardly 
mature. I have not observed that these creatures are par- 
ticularly attached to the pine [Bromel/« Anmias L., Ana- 
nassa saliva Auct.'], though in the forests I have captured 
many interesting species among the vaginating leaves of the 
Tillands/<^ or wild pines, where they had evidently retired 
for shelter and concealment only. The bag, said to contain 
the young, was the egg cell, which is retained in the vagina 
for some time by the females of this genus, till it is indurated 
by atmospheric influence. It is then glued against some 
chosen spot, and covered for concealment in the dirt or any 
substance that may be at hand. The young pine [Bromeh"« 
Ananas L.] in a state of inflorescence, with the crown and 
basilar offsets just developed, is not badly executed. 

Plate 2. The four upper figures represent the Coccinella 
cacti Gmel. 1661., with the pupae; and the two following, 
the cocoon and larva of a small moth ?, said, without pro- 
bability, to devour the Coccinella. The four lower ones 
illustrate the Papilio Dido Fabric. 177. Gmel. 2324. They 
appear rudely done, with the exception of the largest larva. 
The pine is shown in its ripe state, and cut out of its cluster 
of serrated leaves, and ready for the table. I may once for 
all observe, that, when a lepidopterous insect is reversed, that 
portion of the upper wing which is exhibited is incorrectly 
coloured, and does not correspond with the accompanying 
figure of the upper surface of the insect. 

Plate S. Tiiree figures of a giant species of Sphin^', of the 
same group as S. Carolina, executed with more than ordinary 
care. Not known to Fabricius. The exuviae and pupa are 
improperly attached to a branch ; for all these insects descend 
towards the earth, and take their pupal slumber in a ball of 
preparetl dirt, or in a slight cocoon. The pilose head of the 
imago, and the free tongue-case (glossotheca) of the pupa, 

A A 3 



ti5S Observations on Madame Merian's 

more than usually convoluted, are worthy of notice. The 
plant is a species o^ A7id?ia not found with us, which produces 
an unpalatable fruit. 

Plate 4. contains the larva, empty puparium, and imago of 
Papllio jatrophae Fab. 301. GtneL 2308. With the lizard I 
am not acquainted, but disbelieve the improbable story of its 
acquiring the length of 10 or 12 feet. The plant is the 
flowerless head of the Jatropha Mdjiihot, or cassada. 

Plate 5, contains four tolerable figures of ASphin^r Tetrio 
Fab, 32. — See also S, rustica Fab. 33. Gmel. 2385. The 
larva is said to have been destructive to the fields of cassada 
plants. In St. Vincent I have found noble specimens, just 
developed, resting on the leeward or sheltered sides of the 
gru-gru palm {Cocas fusiformis ?). As they were all caught 
on the same tree, at distant intervals, it would appear probable 
that they had fed on its fronds, and had descended through 
the host of needles which beset the trunk, to seek a temporary 
rest, in the pupa state, at its foot. The gravid snake, with 
its eggs, is unknown to me. The unnoticed figure is the 
curious Membracis foliata Fab. 4. Cicada G?nel. 2092. The 
root of the cassada is badly represented, with its tubers ; from 
which, after the evaporation of its />c;/5owow5 juice, the granular 
Ja?Tne, and the flat cassava cakes of the West Indians, are 
prepared. By the act of boiling ohIt/, this juice is (in the De- 
merara settlement) converted into the rich and dark sauce 
called cassaripe. The native Indians form of dark clay their 
pots which bear the name of this sauce, serving to season the 
hunter's daily meal; and the colonist has introduced the 
custom into his more luxurious dwelling. The plan is, to 
throw into the cassaripe pot, which is never cleaned or alto- 
gether emptied, the remains of meat and poultry, to add the 
sauce, and stir the compound preparation, which forms, as I 
can readily testify, a most delicious meal. 

Plate 6. has two species of Saturni«, with their curious 
larvae and cocoons (folliculi), both undetermined. The under 
one approaches a species sent me from the Orinoco trees, on 
the banks of the great river of that name, which assumed the 
imago in my study in St. Vincent. The plant comes near to 
iSolanum torvum, the round berries of which were boiled and 
eaten here, during the partial famine caused by the stony 
showers of the volcano of Morne Soufriere, in 1812. 

Plate 7. seems one of the most valuable in the work, and 
represents the Papilio Achillea Fab. 2534. Gmel. 2245., with 
the larva and oddly shaped pupa. This noble creature, 
soaring in the tropic sun in all its splendour and strength, is 
worthy to bear the name of the Grecian hero. The plant 



Insects^ Src, of Surinam, S59 

seems to be the Malpighi« glabra />., common in our gar- 
dens ; the cherries of which, called here x:hereese, or cerise, 
from their acidity, are used only when preserved. They are 
delicious when encrusted with a coat of white sugar, laid on 
in the sun, by the help of the white of eggs. 

Plate 8. has the curiously armed larva, the pupa and rude 
figures of Papilio Amphinom^ Fab. 404-. The plant is the 
Plumier/« rubra Z>., whose sweetly scented flowers often cover 
the whole tree before the restoration of its leaves. The tree 
with white flowers is totally distinct, and is a common orna- 
ment of our leeward and rocky coast. 

Plate 9. contains Papilio Nestor Fab. 266. Gmel. 2245. 
The puparium is rudely done, and the larva seems rather to 
belong to some »Sphin^ or nocturnal moth, though it is said to 
have produced the butterfly before us. The phmt is the 
pomegranate (Punica GranatumZ^.), with the fruit burst open, 
and showing the pale sweet coat which protects the seeds; and 
has iill the glassy splendour of gems, so difficult to represent 
on paper. 

Plate 10. Three rude figures of the larva, pupa, and imago 
of Hesperia (Papilio) Cupido Fabr. 1. Gmel. 2336. ; a species 
remarkable for the spots of burnished silver, of the greatest 
brilliancy, on the inferior surface. The three lower figures 
illustrate a pale-coloured moth of the size of Cerura vinula, 
not known to Fabricius. The cotton plant (Gossypium bar- 
badense L, ?) is more than usually faithful. 

Plate 11. The two figures of the sexes of i^ombyx (Pha- 
lae^na) erythrinae Fahr. 13. G?neL 2403., are neatly engraved, 
with the pupa and exuviae. If one can depend on the 
drawings of the larvae, and the accompanying statements, we 
have here an extraordinary instance of the change which 
takes place during the developement of the larva, I have 
myself, as well as other observers, witnessed the disappear- 
ance of spots, the alteration of colour, and the variations in 
the clothing of caterpillars ; but have never noticed so great 
changes as are here described. The yellow larva, at its first 
moulting, exchanges its transverse bands for lateral spots ; 
at the second, the six strong spines which defended the body 
are laid aside, and the general colouring of the animal under- 
goes a change. The plant is a most beautiful species of Ery- 
thrina, not cultivated by us. 

Plate 12. We have the male, the larva, pupa, and cocoon 
of an undetermined species of Saturnifl, very nearly allied in 
many respects to a beautiful species which I have lately 
drawn in all its stages, for insertion in the costly zoological 
work of my correspondent, Mr. Wilson of Edinburgh, under

the name of A'ttacus WilsonzV. Indeed, I am not certain if 
it be not the very same. However, the coarse colouring and 
engraving will always render it impossible to determine this 
point. The flowers, with their strange subcoriaceous enve- 
lope, and the young fruit of the plantain (Musa paradisiaca 
L.\ are tolerably well designed, though, even in a folio work, 
justice can hardly be done to these wonderful vegetable pro- 
ductions, which may well be thought worthy of paradise, and 
the names they bear [as paradisiaca, sapientum, ornata, su- 
perba]. I have commenced a Pomona on atlas sheets, whose 
size will enable me to depict the larger products of our 
gardens. Nine sheets I have devoted to the bread fruit 
(Artocarpus incisa L.) alone, and its varieties, and yet I have 
not done it so completely as I have wished. How, then, shall 
we expect, in small-sized works, figures which can give to the 
European any tolerable idea of the more splendid gifts of 
Flora? 

Plate 13. contains the larva, pupa, and two figures of an 
undescribed Hesperia? The larva is a remarkable object: 
instead of being spiny, as represented, I should rather think 
the back must have been clothed with fallen flowers ; the ap- 
pearance of the filaments and anthers is very clear. I have 
in spirits a lepidopterous larva, the processes of whose back 
are tipped with the yellow anthers on which it fed ; a covering 
adapted for concealment, and not more wonderful than the 
stercoraceous coat worn by the cannibal larvae of several 
orders, and by some small land testaceous Mollusca, and 
which protects them from birds, by giving them the appear- 
ance of the dung of bats. The plant is rudely done, and 
infamously coloured : the fruit should have been yellow. Can 
it be the hog plum (A^pondias Myrobalanus L.) of the An- 
tilles ? A useless plant. 

Plate 14. The three central figures belong to a white and 
colourless unknown moth, sent me from Demerara. The 
three exterior ones represent an undetermined <Sphin.r, very 
nearly approaching S. Carolina, but, without doubt, distinct, 
especially as far as regards the larva. A common and neg- 
lected, but delicious, West Indian fruit, the Anbna muricata 
/>., or soursop, is very correctly drawn. 

Plate 15. has three figures of the larva, cocoon, and imago 
of a black nocturnal moth, which does not seem to have 
occurred to other writers. The larva is remarkable for its 
quadrate bulky outline, and the hairy blunt processes of the 
extremities, and the slime said to accompany it. Our fair 
author is not the first entomologist who has been disappointed 
in the expectation of something splendid after the metamor- 



Insects, Sfc, of Surinam, 361 

phosis of insects. Larvae of forbidding aspect sometimes 
shine, in their hour of perfection, in all the glorious tints of 
gems, and gold, and silver, and gaudy flowers, while those of 
more lovely hues produce in the end a garb of sober colours. 
The plant is the water melon (Cucurbita Citrullns L.). Though 
a cooling fruit, it becomes insipid here, and hardly merits 
the praises it has received in the warmer regions of the old 
world. 

Plate 16. The central figures are useless, and, I think, 
confused. The white larva is of wonderful structure, and 
equals in interest any of those so beautifully depicted in the 
plates lately published by the indefatigable Dr. Horsfield. 
It is more probable that it produced the white cocoon and 
colourless moth so shamefully engraved. The banded larva 
has the aspect of those of many Papiliones, and, with the pupa 
on the stalk, I should suppose, belongs to the butterfly here 
neatly drawn, which is the Papilio anacardii Fabr. 567. It 
is the P. Piera Gmel. 2257., and the P. anacardii, 2258. ! of 
this careless compiler. The upper part of the plate is a very 
fair representation of the leaves, flowers, and young fruit of 
the cashew (Anacardium occidentale) ; but the lower part of 
the engraving exhibits an unpardonable instance of the au- 
thor's carelessness, and of the readiness with which she listened 
to the stories of those who sent her subjects for her pencil. 
The ripe fruit is reversed, and, by means of an imaginary 
peduncle, placed under the leaves, where it never grows. The 
yellow variety is most valued when sweet, and is often used 
to communicate a pleasant flavour to punch. They are seldom 
eaten except when preserved, from the vile indelible stains 
they communicate to our linen. The truly reniform external 
nuts, when deprived of their very caustic oil by hot coals, 
afford one of the most delicious of all kernels, which will 
keep for a long time. Bottles are sometimes tied under the 
young fruit, which is allowed to grow within till it is large 
and ripe, when it is preserved in spirits as a curiosity, and 
serves to exercise the ingenuity of children, who cannot 
account for the method of its introduction. 

Plate 17. The larva, pupa, and two figures of Papilio 
Anchise5 Gmel. 2230. The pretty larva is remarkable for 
those retractile cervical scent organs called by Kirby osmateria, 
which are found in some of its congeners, as Papilio Poly- 
damas Drury. The small figures are rude attempts to 
represent some of the Coccidae. The plant is the lime (Citrus 
Lima) with its delicate odoriferous blossoms, abounding in 
our islands. The young lime forms one of the finest green 
preserves when emptied, and the fine acid of the ripe ones

Plate 18. n)ay serve for an entomological caricature exhi- 
bited on the branch of a guava tree [Psidium], The large 
spiders are the well-known giant ^ranea avicularia Fahr. 6S. 
I disbelieve the existence of an egg-shaped cocoon-like ha- 
bitaciiliim, into which they are said to retreat. The only web 
I have seen them weave in captivity is loose, of snowy white- 
ness and moderate strength. Doubtless this species is strong 
enough to overcome small birds, if it could seize them ; for the 
prominent horny mandibles resemble in size and solidity the 
talons of a hawk.* The spider on the left is the ^ranea 
venatoria Fabr, 7. ; the Thomisus venatorius Latt\ Madame 
Merian has given it credit for ingenuity which it does not 
possess. It spins no shrouds or ladders; and weaves nothing 
but the flat circular egg-purse {tlieca)^ which is carried under 
the breast, supported by the palpi only, and not aggluti- 
nated, as in some spiders, to the belly; or deserted, as by 
others. It runs about houses in the night-time, frequents the 
same spots, and murders the all-consuming [see V. 481.], bold, 
and buzzing cockroaches. It is never destroyed by the negroes ; 
who say, if killed, it would cause them to break cups and 
glasses. Thus an absurd superstition serves to protect a 
useful creature ; which, though of threatening aspect, is timid 

[* The story of a spider which catches and devours birds had, Mr. 
MacLeay believes, its origin with Madame Merian. Oviedo, Labat, and 
Rochefort make no mention of any spider as possessing such habits, the 
two latter writers going no farther than the statement, that in the Ber- 
mudas there exists one which makes nets of so strong a construction as to 
entangle small birds. Madame Merian, however, went the length of as- 
serting that one spider not only caught, but devoured, small birds ; and 
figured the iliygale avicularia Walchenaer^ in the act of preying on a hum- 
ming-bird. Now the ilfygale does not spin a net, but resides in tubes 
under ground, and in all its movements keeps close to the earth ; while 
humming-birds never perch except on branches. The food of ikfygale 
consists of Jiili, Porcelliones, subterranean ^chetas, and -fflattas : a liv- 
ing humming-bird, and a small Anolis, placed in one of its tubes, were not 
only not eaten by the spider, but the latter actually quitted its hole, which 
it left in possession of the intruders. The largest spider of the West 
Indies that spins a geometrical web is the Nephila clavipes Leach ; and 
its net may, perhaps, occasionally, be strong enough to arrest the smaller 
among the humming-birds : but it is not likely that the spider would eat 
the birds. A small species of Sphaeriodactylus Cuvier [a lizard], intro- 
duced into one of these nets, was enveloped in the usual manner by the 
spider ; but as soon as the operation was completed, the spider lost no 
time in cutting the line, and allowing her prisoner to fall to the ground. — 
Mr. MacLeay consequently disbelieves the existence of any bird-catching 
spider. (^Froman abstract of a communication made by Mr. MacLeay to the 
Zoological Society, and read on Feb. 11. 1834. The abstract is published in 
Taylor's Phil. Mag. for JunCy 1834. vol. iv. p. 460—462. Third Series.)]

and harmless, and only occupied in ridding us of loathsome 
and offensive vermin. The ants are the i'ormica cephalotes 
Fah\ 52. Gmel. 2802. Even after the facts recorded as pro- 
ceeding from the all-wonderful instinct of these Cossack and 
Arab plunderers, one can scarcely credit their bridge of 
bodies, more singular than the chain-bridges of our rivers. 
In my garden, I find that hymenopterous insects (after the 
manner of swarming bees) crowd together for sleep on the 
extremities of plants ; and I have seen a large group of four 
species, though of different genera, and even distinct tribes, 
attached by the feet to the bodies of each other, and slumber- 
ing in peace and quietness. What an example for unsocial 
and jealous men ! The custom of cutting off the leaves of 
trees calls to one's mind the parasol ant of Trinidad. There 
we may see marching legions of these beings, with a leaf 
elevated over their heads, like a London crowd, on a rainy 
day, following the lord mayor's show, with innumerable um- 
brellas ; or rather, as they observe the order and decorum 
which the mob despise, they represent, on a Lilliputian 
scale, with their leafy screens, the enemies of Macbeth descend- 
ing from " Birnam wood to Dunsinane." These leaves are, 
however, probably collected to cover in their nest, rather 
than to " shadow the numbers of their host." The bird is 
probably fancied; the nest is too much like a pot of clay; 
there should have been two instead of the four eggs, which 
look like peas cut out of chalk. The figure gives one no 
idea of the tiny well-proportioned nest, formed of the silken 
pappus of plants, collected before it floats into the atmo- 
sphere, and bound round some pensile twig with the fairy 
fastenings of stolen cobwebs. 

Plate 19. The three small figures belong to one of those 
splendid metallic flies which buzz, and poise themselves like 
hawks, in the tropical landscape. She represents them to 
have sprung from the larger pupa naturally ! but '* rariore 
metamorphosi : " one cannot fix the species. The three left- 
hand figures represent the Papilio psidii Fahr, 525. Gmel, 
2254. The others illustrate the beautiful and curious larva, 
folliculus, and imago of a large nocturnal moth, not inserted 
in the works of Fabricius. The red guava (Psidium pyri- 
ferum) is a fruit common on our higher pastures, and the 
skirts of woods. 

Plate 20. We have here, considering the state of the 
arts in 1 726, fine figures of the gigantic bat-like E^rebus 
(A^octua) iuStrix Fabr. 3. Gmel. 2529. The cocoon is of lar^re 
size ; and the larva, though subj)ilose, from its anal horn 
approaches the outline of those of the Sphmgida: It under- 



S64 Observations ofi Madame Merian^s 

goes, like some of those caterpillars, a change of colour when 
mature. The exudation like a bunch of eggs is one of those 
natural gums or resins which force their way from the over- 
charged vessels of many a tropical tree ; and hang like opaque 
icicles, or ooze like streams of frozen tears, from accidental 
wounds. 

Plate 21. The four figures first noticed are those of a 
small moth, and not a diurnal Papilio. The paler larva, 
with its curious habitaculum of cemented sticks, being evi- 
dently, like my genus Oiketicus of the Linncean Transactions 
[vol. XV. tab. 6.]? referable to the Lepidoptera, could never 
have produced the red bug (a Reduvius?) figured in the 
plate. The darker caterpillar and the cocoon are also those 
of a lepidopterous insect ; though out of this, she asserts, 
she procured the specimen of Petalopus {Kirhij) Cimex Lat, 
drawn at the bottom. With such instances of carelessness 
and neglect before one, we must receive with caution the 
more improbable assertions in her journal of the metamor- 
phosis of the Surinam productions. The Passiflora is a showy 
species; though the fruit, which I have received from Deme- 
rara, is not valuable, and infinitely inferior to that of many 
kindred plants. 

Plate 22. The three larger figures represent a fine and 
distinct but undescribed Saturni«, belonging to the same 
group as those depicted in plates 6. and 12. The larva is very 
beautiful, and clothed with a vesture of plant-like branched pro- 
cesses, imitating the ciliated calyxes of some vegetables. She has 
remarked iheferrea^fila, or hard pungent bristles, with which 
the ramuli terminate. The two small figures are the larva 
and cocoon of some lepidopterous animal, which she idly sup- 
poses produced the Lygae^us, or some cimicoid insect, which 
is inserted in the plate. These strange mistakes must have 
arisen from breeding many insects together, but are hardly to 
be excused by the then imperfect knowledge of annulose 
transformations. The lily is beautifully drawn, and is com- 
mon in all West India gardens, where it blossoms without 
culture, and occasionally becomes double. 

Plate 23. Four of the figures illustrate the curiously 
armed larva, the pupa, and imago of Papilio Teucer Fabr. 271. 
Gmel. 2248., which appear carefully drawn. The lizard is 
doubtful ; these creatures differ beyond measure in the in- 
tensity and disposition of their spots and markings. The eggs 
of the diurnal species are more elongate than those figured ; 
and they are covered, as in the turtle, with a coriaceous skin. 
The eggs of nocturnal lizards are rounder, and have a cal- 
careous shell : hence they are deposited anywhere ; whereas 



Insects^ (§T., of Surinam. 365 

the former, unless committed to the damp earth, would perish. 
The young must be incorrectly traced : I have always observed 
that, tor the size of the eggs, the young of lizards are singularly 
large and active. The fruit is that of the ripe and edible 
banana (Mus« sapientum L,). 

Plate 24. The spotted figure is the Cerambyx farinosus 
Gmel. 1820. See also his C. cinnamomeus, 1817. ! This she 
supposes to have proceeded from the linear larva above it, 
which seems to me to belong to the Elateridae ; and resembles 
a luminous one which, I have fancied, belongs to Elater noc- 
tiliicus, though I have not bred it. The white larva, she 
affirms, produced the beetle at the summit of the plant, 
which [beetle] is the Prionus melanopus Fabr. 30., Cerambyx 
Gmel. 1816., and is quoted as a synonyme of the P. spinibarbis 
Fah7\ 25. ! It seems to be a pregnant specimen ; we have one 
like it common in the decayed trunks of the silk-cotton bom- 
bax. There seems, indeed, to be a group of kindred species 
most shamefully confused by entomological writers. The 
larger figure, which she has not noticed, is the Cerambyx 
spinibarbis Gmel. 1818., remarkable for the unusual structure 
of the mandibles. The plant Argemone mexicana L. is well 
represented. 

Plate 25. The four larger figures exhibit the Papilio 
passiflorae Fabr: 189., P. vanillae Gmel. 2336. The former 
name only is appropriate. It devours greedily the leaves of 
Passiflora Zauritolia, &c. Though it does not injure the 
arbours on which these delicious fruits are cultivated, it spoils 
the beauty of the foliage for a time, if suffered to propagate 
the family. The outlines of the small moth are useless. The 
plant is a large variety of the vanilla of commerce (Epiden- 
drum Vanilla \_Va7iUla aromatica »Sie;:s.]), so famed for commu- 
nicating a grateful flavour to our chocolate. 

Plate 26. The four figures represent a nocturnal moth, 
not described. The coco branch (Theobroma Cacao L.) is but 
rudely drawn. The painter, moreover, has attempted to 
improve on nature in the disposition of the flowers : it is but 
rarely that the smaller branches are productive. The frail 
and pretty blossoms issue in an unusual manner from the 
larger limbs and the rough and unsightly trunk. The spongy 
pulp which surrounds the ripe berries of which the chocolate 
is made affords a pleasant acid refreshment. 

Plate 27. The three upper figures represent an undeter- 
mined moth. The filiform worm resembles nothing in nature ; 
though, on the testimony of her serva nigrita, she supposes it 
to have produced the Mantis, which is the very remarkable 
M. strumaria Fabr. 21. Gmel. 2053. Tiie figure between 



366 Observations on Madame Merian^s 

the fruits is the group of eggs. In the J51atta2, we have the 
eggs enclosed in a common inartificial egg-cell (loculi/s). The 
Phasmadse lay them separately; whereas, in the Mantida?, 
though the eggs are laid singly, they are always agglutinated 
in a group of a given determined form, which is preserved 
after the young have escaped by the vertical foramina. After 
the deposition of the ova (eggs), the female secretes a wax-like 
fluid, and varnishes the mass ; all the time directing the 
motion of the anus by the styles, which serve as anal antennae. 
The cockroach apple (»Solanum mammosum), without flowers, 
is tolerably executed ; and is said to expel those noxious 
creatures [see V. 481.] from which its trivial name is de- 
rived : but I doubt whether it possesses this much-desired 
property. 

Plate 28. The three upper figures belong to an undescribed 
pale moth. The larva is most interesting ; the lanate processes 
are said, like cowitch, to inflame the surface of the body ; and 
the animal adheres by an agglutinating skin. The rude and 
larger figure represents one of the most gigantic and singular 
of the Capricorn tribes of beetles, the Acrocinus longimanus 
Kirby, Prionus Fabt\ 1., Cerambyx GmcL 1814., Macropus 
pictus Leach, Zool. Misc. vol. ii. tab. 89. The fruit is the 
citron (Citrus Medica var.) cultivated in our gardens; the 
thick rind of which is dried in sugar, as in Madeira, and used 
in pastry. Considering the former state of the arts, this is cer- 
tainly a masterly plate, representing the various states of the 
gorgeous Urania Leilu5, Papilio Fabr. 63. Gmel. 2237. * The 
fine fruit is that of the shaddock (Citrus decumana L.), said 
to be so named after the captain who introduced it : there is 
a variety with red and another with white pulp. If the fruit 
of the shaddock is suffered to ripen on the tree, it is doubt- 
less one of the finest of the citrine tribe, and certainly the 
largest. The clusters of this gigantic fruit are so heavy, that, 
were not the wood close-grained and very tough, Flora would 
have been compelled to suspend these bulky presents on the 
trunk; as she has done the jack fruit (Artocarpus integrifolia 
Z/.) and other larger productions of the vegetable kingdom. 

[* Mr. MacLeay in a communication to the Zoological Society, read on 
Feb. 11. 1834, has described the egg, larva, pupa, imago, transformations, 
and characteristics of form and of habits, in a good degree of detail, of a 
previously undescribed species of Urania, v^^hich he has named Urania Fer- 
nandinae. An abstract of this communication is published in Taylor's 
Philosopfdcal Magazine for June, 1834, vol. iv. p. 460—462. third se- 
ries. Mr. MacLeay, in concluding his communication on the U. Fernan- 
dinae, refers " to Madame Merian's description of the metamorphosis of 
U. Leilu5, and to her figure of its larva, both of which he regards as un- 
worthy of credit." (Taylor's Phil. Mag. as above.)]

Plate 30. The four upper figures are of the Papilio 
ricini Fabr. 517. Gmel. 2253., which I have received from 
Demerara. The two other figures may possibly have been 
intended for the Oiketicus Kirby/, which 1 have described in 
the fifteenth volume of the Liiincean Transactions, with two 
plates ; but her scanty description will not clear up the diffi- 
culty. Either we have before us a larva of similar economy, 
or she has altered and distorted the outline of the habitacu- 
lum, in order to give it the appearance of an Indian swinging 
in his hammock. The case is only suspended by the ante- 
rior extremity in our animals. The castor-oil bush (/ficinus 
connnunis L.) is correctly done. The leaves are applied to 
blisters ; and the expressed oil used in medicine, or in the 
nightly chamber lamp. 

In Plate 31. w^e have four figures of Papilio Polycao7i 
Fabr. 96. Gmel. 2236. It surely cannot be properly quoted 
as the P. Polydama5? Fabr. 42. Gmel. 2231. The larva is 
curiously marked; and, instead of the sexes, possibly two 
species are depicted. The plant is the changeable rose 
(//ibiscus mutabilis L.). 

Plate S2. The well armed larva, pupa, and two figures 
of Papilio cassias Fabr, 461. Gmel. 2280., a large and lovely 
species. The plant is the medicinal Cassia occidentalis A, 
or stinking weed. The whole is neatly engraved. 

Platens. Very rude figures of *S'phin.r ficus Fabr. 31. 
Gmel. 2380. ; the female of which is well figured in Drury's 
great work. The male is smaller, the wings less ample, and 
the antennae thicker. The upper larva well represents the 
alteration of colour which it undergoes before the pupal 
change. The plant of fig is of that species cultivated in 
gardens throughout the world. 

Plate 34. We have here the Sphinx labruscse Fabr. 66, 
Gmel. 2380., so beautifully lithographed in the first series of 
Swainson's Zoological Illustrations. The larva is well done, 
and is remarkable for the attenuated neck, the shagreen-like 
shoulders, and the changeable lovely spot on the anal pro- 
minence. It is very voracious; and, in a neighbouring 
island, a host of these caterpillars lately destroyed acres of 
canes : an account of their depredations I have given in the 
47th volume of the Transactions of the Society of Arts ^ &c. 
The black grape looks more tempting than in nature : our finr 
author regrets it has not been cultivated in vineyards. It is 
to be feared the excessive heats of these regions would inter- 
fere with the proi)er fermentation of the wine. 

Plate '35. The four larger figures illustrate the Papilio 
sophorae Fabr. 459. Gmel. 2282. The larva is said to be 



368 Observatiojis on Madame Merian^s 

gregarious under a common web (tentorium)^ from which it 
sallies forth at night for food. The three small figures are 
those of Papilio Clio Fabr. 531. Gmel. 2254. With the plant 
I am not acquainted. 

Plate 36. The four large figures well represent a species 
of the genus Castnia, established by Fabricius in his last 
work, the Systema Glossatorum, which death prevented him 
from completing. It is the Papilio Licu5 Drury, i. tab. 16. 
f. 1, 2. The minor figures belong to some of the Cicadadae, 
which, in their earlier states, if I recollect rightly, imitate the 
larvae of the Myrmeleonidae, and wear a coat of excrements, 
exuviae, and other matter, for concealment. The plant, which 
is only beautiful as the gradually developed flowers are ex- 
panded, blossoms in our botanic garden. Well may the fair 
author complain of the difficulties of penetrating through the 
" bush," to use a colonial term. Though we have not the 
many thorny plants which attack the sportsman in England, 
the traveller meets too often with the strong spines of the 
climbing Dioscore^^; and the sharp blades of the frightful 
razor grass, which inflict deep and painful gashes on the 
cheeks and hands. 

Plate 37. The first three figures are those of a small 
and pretty, but undetermined, moth; while a small Cicada? 
is rudely drawn below. The plant is said to be a red variety 
of the ochro, which I have never seen. Our true ochro 
(J^ibiscus esculentus L.) has yellow flowers and much more 
ample leaves. The young pods [green, tender, and un- 
ripened capsules], which vary in length and shape, are plain 
boiled, and eaten as vegetables, with butter and pepper and 
salt. When more advanced, but still green, they are made 
into a glutinous soup, or form an ingredient in the pepperpot, 
the most famous dish of the Creoles, which is principally 
composed of the leaves of the calaloo (a kind of Calddium), 
and seasoned with crabs, salt fish, or pork. 

Plate 38. The upper and smaller figures are meant for 
the Papilio jatroph aria P<2Z>r. 89. Gmel. 2469.; the four lower 
ones for ASphin.r jatrophae Fabr, 22. Gmel. 2376. Though 
the larva is better, these seem too rude to be depended on. 
The species approaches in size Sphinx Tetrio of the fifth plate. 
The plant is the Jatropha gossypifolia, which abounds in our 
low lands, and is remarkable for the quantity of those viscous 
pedunculated glands which form fatal traps, in many cases, to 
swarms of the smaller insects. 

Plate 39. illustrates an undetermined ^phin^r, whose imago, 
in general outline, approaches the subgenera Smerinthus Lat. 
and Thyreu5 Swains. ; but the length of the antlia, and the 



Lisects, S^-c, of Surinam. 369 

outline of the larva, are against its admission into these groups. 
The plant appears to be a weed which adorns our ditches 
with its pretty sulphur blossoms. 

Plate 40. The small larva, cocoon, and moth refer to a 
species which, from their rudeness, it is, of course, impossible 
to determine. The other three figures illustrate the small 
Papilio caricae Fabr, 155. GmeL 2354., whose larva has 
curious elongate hair-shaped processes. The sketch of the 
variety of the papay (Carica Papaya L.), with rounded fruit, 
is very bad indeed. It is one of those giant vegetables to 
which justice cannot be done on paper of limited dimensions, 
and without the aid of a scientific draughtsman. The fruit is 
sweet when ripe, though little valued. When green, it is 
boiled as apple sauce, being mixed up with lime juice and 
sugar. Thus prepared, it is impossible to detect the im- 
position. 

Plate 41. The plants are the Indian shot (Canna in- 
dica L.) supporting the red-rooted variety of the sweet 
potato (Conv61vulus Batatas L.). The round black seeds 
of the former serve, at a small distance, for shot. The flowers 
are pretty ; but the fast-spreading roots are difficult to era- 
dicate when once established. The tubers of the latter, when 
mealy, are a sweet but delicious vegetable, either boiled or 
fried in slices. The insect figures are all worthless. The 
more curious larva has strange globular hairy processes, and 
the cocoon belongs to it. The large figure is the Lygae^us 
Merian<^ Fabr. 3., with the antennae broken. Every boy 
entomologist will perceive it could have no connection with 
the larva just noticed, as Madame Merian asserts it had. 
The upper moth seems one of the Botydae common on our 
plants of the gourd family, whose leaves it often wholly 
destroys. From its large anal tuft of scales, I have lately 
referred it to a subgenus, which I have called Phakellilra. 

Plate 42. The plant is the musk ochro (/fibiscus Abel- 
moschus L.). The seed-vessel has a musky odour, and pro- 
duces seeds which are strung into necklaces by the ladies. 
The six entomological figures are vile and useless. 

Plate ^fS. has four figures of Papilio Protesilau5 Fabr. 69., 
Gmel. 2243. The larva, though black, is rendered interest- 
ing by the many ramulose, and the two stellated, processes. 
The wild fruit Madame Merian represents as eatable. The 
berried creeper and young TillandszVz are parasites. 

Plate 44. — In the lower part of the plate are three figures 
of Hesperia bixae Fabr. 307., Pap. Gmel 2367. The larva 
is not only covered with pilose fascicles, but the pupa also. 
This is a rare circumstance among the Lepidoptera, though 

Vol. VII. — No. 40. b b 



370 Ohsewations on Madame Meriaifs 

we may occasionally observe scattered squamulas or a light 
pruina. Above are three figures of a moth not determined by 
any scientific writer. The elongate larva bears some resem- 
blance to one I have described in the Transactions of the 
Society of Arts, ^c., vol. xlvii., as very destructive to the 
fields of sugar cane in the island of Bequia. The Bi^ra Orel- 
Icina L., or anotto, is tolerably executed. This plant, so well 
known in commerce, is easily cultivated here, but has never 
been attended to by the planter, whose whole thoughts and 
cares are absorbed by the more productive cane. 

Plate 45. lias three figures of a »Sphinjr, of the same group 
as *S. Carolina, not known to modern authors, though appa- 
rently very distinct. The yellow variety? of the Poincifl7z« 
pulcherrima i., or flower- fence, as it is called, seems a dis- 
tinct species, as I never can detect any changing in its petals. 
It forms a pretty hedge, and is used by the Creole doctresses 
among their credulous patients. 

Plate 46. We have here another distinct species of 
(SphinjT not determined. The antennae seem fictitious. With 
the plant and snake I am not acquainted. 

Plate 47. With a showy figure of a branch and bunch 
of white grapes, are given, above, three rude figures of S'^iwx 
vkis Fabr. 41. Gmeh 238G. Drury 1. p. 28. f. 1. I have 
observed, with Madame Merian, the tendency which the 
more light-coloured larvag of this and other species have to 
become rufescent before their pupal change. The singular 
larva, and the other two figures below, should apparently be 
referred to 6'phinjr satellitia Fabr. 42. Gmel, 2381. Drwy 1. 
t. 29. f. 1, 2. 

Plate 48. The plant seems allied to Eugenz^, and ap- 
pears to be mistaken for a tree which furnished a pigment to 
the savage natives. A lepidopterous larva, remarkable for its 
regular and close fasciculi of hairs, is given with the ceeoon : 
and out of this, without the slightest probability, is said to 
have proceeded the large bee added below. The beetle with 
expanded wings is said to be the Prion us cervicornis Fabr. 12, y 
Cerambyx Gmel. 1814. In the centre is the Cord^'lia [Ca- 
Imdra) palmarum Fabr. 2. Gmel. 1740., the prince of the 
destructive tribes of the Curculionidae. The larva or gru-gru 
worm, so misplaced here, resembles nothing in nature but a 
lump of fat. In the Transactions of the Society of Arts, Sec, 
vol. xlvi., I have given descriptions and coloured plate, fully 
illustrating this fine insect in all its stages. The gru-gru 
worm is still eaten by a few persons : they are fried in butter, 
and the gceedy epicure, holding the hard horny head between 
his fingers, sucks out the fat entrails of this disgusting mor-

ceaii. [An abstract of Mr. Guilding^s description, and copies 
of his figures, of the Calandra palmarum, as published in 
The Transactions of the Society of Arts, have been given in 
this Magazine, V. 466— 469.] 

Plate 49. — The subterraneous larva and the smaller ex- 
panded figure belong to a true Cicada, but not, I think, the 
Tettigonia tibicen Tahr. 8. The larger figures well repre- 
sent the noble Fulgora lanternaria Fahr. 1. Gmel, 2089., one 
of the most singular of all insects, and a precious addition to 
any cabinet. The creature at the bottom is fictitious. The 
hollow lantern-shaped head of the Fulgora has been glued on 
a Tettigonia, and probably sold to our good-tempered author 
by some cunning negro. From her words, '* Persuasum mihi 
ab Indis est," she had evidently no better authority for pre- 
senting us with this strange figure. The sounds of the 
Cicada, so like those of the razor-grinder's wheel, are not 
produced by the proboscis, but by the wonderful and com- 
plex tympanum, which occupies half the abdomen of the 
clamorous and impatient male. From the peculiar shrillness 
of the confused notes drawn from the quickly agitated organ, 
the creature is heard not only at a great distance, but is 
superior in attracting the attention to anything I know. 
Often, as the sun has been descending, and I have been per- 
forming the solemn service of the dead, one of these creatures 
has lighted on some neighbouring plant, and commenced his 
evening hymn, and thus disturbed me. At other times, 
attracted by the lights at evening service, the noisy intruder 
will enter my parish church, and distress the preacher with 
his rival voice. If its jarring notes cannot be said to drown 
my powerful organ, they are certainly heard distinctly above 
everything by the still assembly. Madame Merian gives us 
an account of her first discovery of the shining property of 
the Fulgora, and tells us of the horror which seized her when 
she opened the box to separate the quarrelling inmates, and 
saw it filled with fire. A glass full of any of our luminous 
insects, when in health, is, indeed, a splendid show. The 
plant is the monstrous or double variety of the pomegranate 
(Punica Granatum Z/.), sometimes cultivated as an ornament 
of our gardens. 

Plate 50. . Above is Passalus interruptus Fabr, J., Zu- 
canus GmcL 1590., with the nympha ; and below is the noble 
^uprestis gigantca Tahr 4. GmeL 1926. The two larvae, 
from the situation in which she found them, are without 
doubt improperly referred to these lignivorous beetles : pos- 
sibly they belong to the *ScarabaL»'idoe. The plant is a tropical 
luber-bearing Convolvulus L.

372 Observations on Madame Meriarfs 

Plate 51. is useless : it represents a species of Colias {Pa- 
pilio L.\ and some singular plant unknown to me. 

Plate 52. has three figures of the bat-like ^ombyx A'tlas 
Fabr. 1. Gmel. 24-00. The larva (as is generally the case in 
these plates) is most carefully engraved. All the insects of 
this princely subgenus which I have taken in our forests, so 
far from being " volatu celeres " [swift in flight], were very 
heavy, and easily captured. She describes the cocoon as 
affording a good silk which would be useful in commerce were 
it possible to domesticate the moth. The plant is the Seville 
orange (Citrus vulgaris), hardly valued as a fruit. The thick 
skin, when emptied of the pulp, forms a fine preserve. 

Plate 53. The splendid Papilio Menelau5 Fabr. 270. 
Gmel. 2244. The larva has very remarkable dorsal needles, 
and the pupa a free humeral process of very unusual form. 
The plant, whose seeds are eatable, 1 do not know. 

Plate 54. About the flowers of some kind of Heliconia 
are six figures of two moths of no value. The vespoid in- 
sect belongs to that group so remarkable for its economy ia 
constructing cells of mud, in which the ovum is sealed up 
with the destined [living] food of the future larva, disabled 
by the parent's poison, but not destroyed. 

Plate 55, Here, again, is a distinct species of ^Sphin-^*, 
unknown to Fabricius, on a sprig of some species of Cap- 
sicum : on this several varieties of the berries are fixed 
without any attention to nature. The many kinds of peppers, 
so useful and palatable in hot countries, are worthy of being^ 
well drawn and better known. 

Plate 56. contains, as its name imports, the largest of its 
genus, the JYepa grandis Fabr. 1. Gmel. 2120., with its larva. 
The frog, with its spawn and young, is the i?ana (Hyla) 
Meriana Shaw's Zoology, vol. iii. p. 133. t. 39. The plant, if 
my memory is faithful, has been introduced into Barbadoes, 
where curious persons keep it in tubs of water to enjoy the 
beauty of its blossoms. At the bishop's residence, I saw 
numbers of them in flower. 

Plate 51, To the left are representations of ^Sphin^ 
Carolina Fabr» 25. Gmel, 2377., Curtis's Genera of Insects^ 
pi. 195. The plate contains also the cocoon and larva of a 
Saturnia? If I judge rightly, the caterpillar is remarkable 
for its dense coat, which gives it the appearance of the French 
variety of the dog, which I have seen aged people in their 
dotage cherish so fondly. I have in spirits a specimen equally 
curious from Trinidad. The hair is said here to have acted 
like cowitch. The pupa was fly-blown, and Madame 
Merian has drawn two of the parasites to commemorate 



Insects, S^'C, of Surinam. 373 

iier disappointment. The plant is a variety of guava [Psi- 
dium.] 

Plate 58. — On an unknown plant are figures of a 
Jkfusca Z/., with its larva ; and the larva, pupa, and imago of 
Papilio (Colia5?) sennae Fabr. 56?), The remaining three 
figures on the left are a doubtful species of Zygs^na. The 
larvae of this group use their close fascicles of hair to defend 
the cocoon. The whole is stripped off before the pupal 
change, and disposed radiatim [rayedly] to keep off rain and 
enemies. 

Plate 59, The i2ana (Pipa Laurent^) Pipa Cuv, is figured 
with its pulli lodged in the temporary dorsal cells.* The 
Pyrula, and another shell with a parasitic crab, are not worthy 
of mention. I know not the plant which is here said to be 
used as a spinach and salad. 

Plate 60. With an unknown plant are three figures of the 
magnificent Papilio Idomeneus Fabr. 275. Gmel. 2248. The 
pupa has a large frontal, and another dorsal, club, which give 
it a singular aspect. The larva seems in no way connected 
with this butterfly, and probably would produce a Saturnia. 
The words " telae autem statim sese intexuit" confirm the idea. 
The Papilionidse spin no cocoon ; even the Hesperiae are but 
enclosed in the leaves convoluted by the silken threads of the 
larva. The wasp is the marabunce of Demerara. I have 
received its nest, though not quite complete : it was as large 
as a child's head, and resembled the bowl of a tobacco pipe 
reversed. It was firmly attached to a strong branch, had a 
smooth hard exterior, and was composed of the usual paper 
mortar, made of the loose epidermis and fibres of various 
woods and branches. At the bottom was a hole, opposite to 
many others, of the same diameter, which afforded a straight 
passage through the parallel horizontal stories of the pendent 
building. 

Plate 61. From this number to the end of the work, with 
one exception, the plates are infamously engraved ; the draw- 
ing, also, is equally faulty. Indeed, the figures are hardly 
worthy of being quoted, and cannot be accurately determined. 
On a branch, which the author, by mistake, calls the white 
guava, and which appears to be the Jatropha Mdnihot L., 
from which the cassada is prepared, we have, above, three 
figures of an unknown pretty moth, and, below, three others, 
which have been supposed to represent the «Sphina' E'llo 
Fabr. 21. Gmel. 2375.

Plate 62. With a bad figure of the papaya (Carica Papaya 
L.), we have six poor figures of two species of iSphin^, evi- 
dently distinct, but which cannot be ascertained, unless, 
perhaps, by those who may capture the larvoe. 

Plate 63. Above are three figures of some Saturniflr, the 
hairs of whose larva are said to have caused on her hands 
the most painful irritation, which subsided on the use of oil. 
Below are three rude figures of what is said to be the Hespe- 
ria Proteu5 Fabr. 256. Gmel. 2362. A branch of the coco 
tree is stuck in the ground, and, by means of much dis* 
tortion and alteration, is at length made to represent a cap- 
sicum bush more than any thing else in nature. Though the 
pericarp is not very large or heavy, Flora in this most 
precious tree only suspends the fruit on the trunk and larger 
branches, and the frail and delicate blossoms have a singular ap- 
pearance as they start (like the marble snowdrop in its chilling 
bed) from the moss-clad, rough, and unsightly bark. The 
plate is worthless. 

Plate 64. On another poor sketch of the papaya we have 
six figures of two doubtful S^VmgidcB ; the lower one has been 
said to be the iS^phin.r caricse Fabr. 67. GyneL 2379. 

Plate 65. On a branch of some Citrus are three figures of 
J^ombyx Hesperus Fabr. 2. Gmel. 2401., all worthless. 

Plate 66. The insects are, perhaps, Mantis siccifolia Fabr. 24. 
Gmel. 2049. See also Mantis precaria Fabr. 32. Gmel. 2050. 
The triangular mass beneath, on which are seen eggs and 
young, I suspect to be a fungus, and not the collection of 
eggs ; for though in this genus there is no egg-cell (locidus), 
as in the T^lattadae, the ova are always deposited in some 
determined and tolerably regular shape and group. The 
quadruped is the Didelphis dorsigera Gmel., with its young, 
rather too fancifully mounted all together on the parent's 
back. 

Plate 67. On a branch of the cultivated fig we have three 
figures of an undetermined Papilio of a group, the larvae of 
which have cervical, elongate, retractile osmateria, or scent 
vessels : in this species they are said to imitate the anal 
mastigia (or whips) of other larvae, and to give a painful 
wound, but I doubt the fact. There are also three figures of an 
unknown moth, remarkable for the spiny process of the pupa.

moths, and below four coarse ones of Papilio Telemachus

Plate 70. is a showy representation of a ground lizard, 
which she complains of, as destroying her hen's eggs in the 
coops. 

Plate 71. We have here (a) figures of the singular jRana 
paradoxa Cuv., and (b) others illustrating the changes of 
European frogs. The unusual transformations here recorded 
by the fair author have, of course, no foundation in fact. The 
only circumstance worthy of notice is, that this species remains 
a very long time in its caudate state, and, indeed, acquires, con- 
trary to the usual law, the greater part of its bulk while yet 
a tadpole. 

Plate 72. The work concludes with a zoological caricature, 
equalling Hogarth's distorted perspective, for we have here 
a larva half the length of the towering column of an areca 
palm. The plate is crowded with various animals from dif- 
ferent parts of the world, introduced without reason or judg- 
ment. No. 1 — 5. are immature i^anae. a, b, c, are marine

Art. XI. On the supposed generic Distinction of Hanunculns 
Ficdria oflAnne, By Charles C. Babington, M.A. F.L.S. &c. 

The 7?anunculus Ficaria Liyin, having been considered by 
many botanical writers of high authority as distinct generic- 
ally from the other 7?anunculi, and having been described 
by them under the names of Ficaria verna and F. ?*anun- 
culoides, I liave been induced to examine the characters 
on which the genus Ficaria is founded, and now give the 
result. 

The plant now under consideration was first formed into a 
distinct genus by Hudson, in his Plm'a Anglica^ p. 24 4., in 
the year 1762, under the name of Ficaria verna, in which he 
lias been followed by Persoon and De I'Arbrc. In M9\, 

B B 4 



376 Supposed Genetic Distinction 

Moencli, in his Methodics Plant. Horti et Agri Malburgensis, 
gave it the name of F. ranunculoides ; a name totally inad- 
missible, being, in the words of Sir J. E. Smith \_English 
Flora, iii. 47.], " a barbarous jumble of Latin and Greek." 
He is, however, followed in that nomenclature by Roth and 
De Candolle, and by Biria, in his Histoire Naturelle des Re- 
noncules. In this country, Lindley also has adopted the latter 
name in Loudon's Enc2/c. of Plants, but considered the plant 
as a Ranunculus in his Synopsis of the British Flora ; and 
Mr. George Don has done the same in his recently published 
General System of Gardening and Botany, All other botanical 
authors have, I believe, followed Linne in considering this 
plant as a species of i^anunculus. 

The characters given by all the above-mentioned botanists 
to distinguish the genera Ficaria and 22anunculus rest wholly 
upon the comparative numbers of the sepals and petals; 
Ficaria having 3 sepals, and 9 petals; and -Ranunculus, 5 
sepals, and 5 or rarely 1 petals. 

That number is of no value in this case, any more than in 
many, I may, perhaps, be allowed to say in all, the other 
cases in which it alone has been employed as a generic cha- 
racter, is, I think, clearly shown by the tables opposite, 
drawn up from the examination of 2682 specimens of this 
plant. It will be seen that some of the varieties which I 
have noticed are true T^anunculi, having sepals 5, and petals 
5 or 1 ; and that, so far from 9 being the typical number of 
petals, 8 occurs in very many more, and 7 in nearly an equal 
number of cases. 

I will, however, leave the reader to draw his own con- 
clusions from the facts, and only add, that I am indebted to 
my friend W. A. Leighton, Esq,, for an account of some 
specimens examined by him at Shrewsbury, given in co- 
lumn 5. of Table I. 

In all the subvarieties under varieties 8, 12, and 17, in 
which the petals are more in number than nine, I consider 
those above that number as stamens transformed into petals ; 
as they may, as I believe, be always referred to a whorl within 
that of the true petals. 

In one specimen of variety 8 subvariety 2, two of the 
stamens had become small scales, being apparently in the first 
stage of their transformation into petals. 

In variety 7 subvariety 3, I consider one of the petals to 
be a transformed stamen, it being slightly within the other 
petals ; and in variety 6 subvariety 3, one of the regular outer 
whorl of sepals is half converted into a petaL 



of Ramhiadus Ficdria L.

distinct varieties, noticed in the examination of 2682 specimens. The 
* added to the number of sepals, denotes that one additional sepal is 
placed more or less below the flower in the form of a bractea ; a denotes 
that one of the petals consisted of two agglutinated together, and having 
two nectariferous scales at its base; and, |, that one petal was formed 
of three joined in the same manner.

Are Potentilla reptans, and Tormentilla r^ptans, distinct 
species P (VI. 251.) — In this neighbourhood Tormentilla rep" 
tans has five petals in, I would at a rough guess say, three 
cases out of every four ; and hence it is extremely difficult to 
distinguish between it and Potentilla reptans. The calyx of 
Potentilla reptans itself is, too, sometimes 8-cleft; and, when 
this circumstance is coupled with the former, I cannot con- 
ceive any imaginable specific distinction between it and Tor- 
mentilla reptans. Indeed, I am inclined to believe that they 
are only varieties of one species, dependent on differences of 
soil. — J, Jones, Gelly, Llarifair, Montgomeryshire, March 2S.

Short Cojnmiinications, 379 

My friend Babingtoii having sent me two specimens of his 
new Maliichius, in order to make a sketch of it to illustrate 
his note, I have given representations of both of them, as 
they appear to be the sexes ; b being evidently a male, and 
c a female, individual. This is a material point, from the 
peculiar structure of the extremity of the elytra, which thus 
appear to be appendiculated in both sexes of this species. 
The same occurs in Malachius bituberculatus Steph. In M. 
ruficoUis, on the contrary, the female, at least, has simple 
elytra. I only possess this sex, and do not know the struc- 
ture of the elytra of the male; but in some species, as Mala- 
chius rubricoilis and pulicarius, the males have the extremity 
of the elytra irregular, and the females have it simple. In 
other species, M. bipustulatus and ae^ieus, the elytra are 
simple in both sexes. The construction of these terminal 
appendages of the elytra is very curious, and apparently dis- 
similar in the different species, requiring a more minute in- 
vestigation than has hitherto been given to it. — J, O. West- 
wood. The Grove, Hammersmith, April 4. 1834. 

Information on the Limneus elongdtus Tui'ton ; on the 
British Limnei generally ; and a Notice of the Difficulties with 
which British Conchology is at ^present beset. — In answer to 
W.W. (p. 161.), I beg to observe that the genus Limneus is 
at present ill understood ; many of the species being ill defined, 
and no two authors, except mere copyists, agreeing which are 
veritable species and which varieties : in fine, it may be truly 
designated " I'udis indigestaque molest To disentangle the 
species, and rectify the errors of authors, would, I fear, in 
the present state of our knowledge, require greater talents 
and perseverance than fall to the lot of the generality of 
mankind. Neither the influence of external circumstances, 
nor the great differences observable in the various periods of 
growth, appear to have been hitherto sufficiently investigated ; 
and a correct monograph on this genus would not only require 
the lyncean eye of a Jenyns [V. 374.], but the searching skill 
of a host of less accomplished auxiliaries. Linnaeus describes 
only three or four species, which have been recognised as be- 
longing to our country ; while my manuscript list of the British 
land and freshwater shells (and which I intend shortly to have 
printed) enumerates no fewer than twelve or thirteen kinds 
which appear to me worthy of specific distinction. 

With respect to the Limneus elongatus Turtbn, Helix 
octanfracta Montagu, H. octona Pennant (p. 161.), and Lym- 
nae^a leucostoma Lamarck, they are all synonymes of one 
species. W. W. is, however, mistaken in supposing that the 
figure 32. in p. 161. is a correct delineation of the above 



380 Short Communications, 

shell. It appears to be a truncated variety of the ^uccinum 
paliistre Miiller, Helix palustris of most British authors, 
Limnae^us fiiscus of Pfeiffer, and is perfectly distinct from the 
former ; differing from it not only in the fewer number of its 
volutions, but in its whole contour, and in the last whorl being 
considerably larger or more inflated than the penultimate one. 

I have not the first edition of Pennant's British Zoology at 
hand ; so I cannot say how far the figure of his H. octona 
may agree with W. W.'s shell [fig. 32. p. 161.]. The H. 
octona of the second edition is a totally different species, 
common in the West Indies ; but has, probably, no claim to 
be considered British, although described as such by nearly 
all our authors. It is arranged in the genus Bulimus by 
Lamarck, but is in reality an Achatina. 

Linnaeus refers to a figure in Gualtieri's Index, as repre- 
sentative of his Helix octona ; but this figure is, unfortunately, 
the Achatina acicula of Lamarck, and is wholly at variance 
with the description given by the illustrious Swede. Baron 
de Ferussac is aware of this discrepancy ; and, in his inimit- 
able work on land and freshwater shells [V. 192.], candidly 
says, in reference to this species, " Nous ne connoissons pas 
la veritable espece de Linne, dont la description ne convient 
ni a V acicula, ni a notre octona'^ On the other hand. Pro- 
fessor Nilsson, a Swedish author, thinks he has discovered 
the long-disputed shell of Linnaeus ; and, in his excellent 
Historia Molluscorum Suecice, describes it under the name of 
Paludina octona, adding, " Hanc esse veram Helicem octo- 
nam Lin., et descriptio Linneana et patria utriusque docet." 

The unravelling of the discordant synonymes with which 
the lovely science of conchology is so thickly beset, is neither 
calculated to please the generality of readers, nor likely to 
inspire the uninitiated with a desire to taste the unalloyed 
sweets resulting from the pursuit of natural history. I will, 
therefore, conclude by observing, that, if W. W. of South- 
ampton will favour me with his address, and a list of the shells 
found in his neighbourhood, we may, perhaps, be of farther 
use to each other by an exchange of specimens, as many 
species occur in the south which are seldom or never met with 
in more northern latitudes. — Joseph Kenyon, 7. Butler Street, 
Preston, April, 1834.

U^nio, Alasmodonta, Anodonta, Cyclas, Melania, Anculosa, 
Planorbis, and Physa. The description is " to be continued."]

Naturalists. 

Edwards, Dr. : On the Influence of Physical Agents on Life. 
Translated from the French, with Notes by Dr. Hodgkin 
and Dr. Fisher. 8vo, 489 pages. Highley, London. 

This is a work of high interest to the philosophical na- 
turalist. The object of the author's researches is to examine 
and ascertain the effects, both separately and conjointly, pro- 
duced by air, water, temperature, light, and electricity on the 
various classes of vertebrated animals. These agents, no 
doubt, almost always act simultaneously and conjointly, and 
and hence it must be a very difficult matter to discriminate 
the influences of one alone from those of the others. Dr. 
Edwards, however, has laboured most meritoriously and 
successfully to elucidate these dark arcana of natural science ; 
and his work is the record of the almost countless, and in 
many instances very curious experiments he has performed, 
and of the highly interesting conclusions to which these ex- 
periments have conducted him. His original views, which 
are numerous and valuable, having been rigidly scrutinised 
and confirmed by the researches of others, we may place the 
most implicit reliance on their authenticity and correctness. 
Dr. Edwards is, indeed, an honour to his country (he is an 
Englishman) ; his work evinces the most unwearied industry, 
and, at the same time, great penetration, ingenuity, and judg- 
ment. He is quite an original thinker, and his mind is 
evidently stamped with the signet of true philosophy. — J, J,

This is a choice addition to what we would term the polite 
literature of botany. Plants have not failed to produce some 
embellishing effect on the polite literature of mankind in 
general, while we think that the literature of botany has re- 
mained, strange as it may seem, until latterly as unpolite as 
well could be. The ideas expressed on plants, and the terms 
in which they have been expressed, have been, among the 
botanical (ourselves, if we may do ourselves this honour, in- 
cluded), too much those of the dissecting room. Plants are 
poeticiil pictures; and to view them but with anatomical eyes 
is, perhaps, to defraud ourselves of the prime of the pleasures 
they give. Well, however this may be, Mr. Lees has, in the 
work before us, collected, and originated, and connected with 
them, a volume of sweet and pleasing associations ; and so 
done much to enrich the imagery of the science of botany, 
and multiply the influences of plants upon human sen- 
timentality. 

" There is a still, a soothing thought, 
With purity and calmness fraught. 

That steals upon the mind ; 
Soft as the tear that eve distils. 
Sweet as the breath of murmuring rills, 
Or music on the wind." 

And plants are, " when all within is peace," effective incentives 
of this blissful state of feeling. The considerations which 
Mr. Lees has offered on them are in promotion of this state 
of feeling; and the enriching and exercising our faculties 
of fancy, memory, and understanding by means of them : the 
offices of plants to these ends constitute what Mr. Lees has 
denominated " the affinities of plants with man."

This is another addition to the polite literature of botany ; 
and it is a very welcome one, because such a one has been for 
some time really wanted, and because it supplies the want in 
(we conceive, from a glance through the work) a clever and 
agreeable manner. The office of the present work is not so 
much like that of the work above, to introduce to ideas which 
appertain without particular relation to the investigation of 
their structure ; but to lead us through the outlines or general 
course of this investigation, and to guide us in an agreeable 
narrative, and not needlessly technical manner, to that dominion 
in knowledge among plants which botany alone can give. The 
plan adopted comprises twenty-five letters, each devoted to the 
explanation, in some detail, of the features which mark the dis- 
tinctions of the more obvious of the natural orders, and to each 
of the letters is prefixed a plate, in which the parts described 
in the given characteristics of the orders, and specimens of the 
plants from which they are taken, plants for the most part very 
easily obtainable, are exhibited.

This work, announced in VL 267, is now published, and 
a copy of it, with which we have been favoured, we have sent 
to a geologist for review, whose remarks we hope to present 
in our next number. In the mean time, we may notice that 
the illustrations contained in the work are striking ; that they 
present, besides pictures of the wonderful creatures which are 
the subject of the volume, numerous details of their osteology 
and general structure; and so supply, we presume, in con- 
junction with the text, the fullest and most perfect account of 
these wonders of the animal world of former ages, which has 
yet been produced. The author in his geological deductions 
seems in entire accordance with the account of the creation 
by Moses, taking the separate days as distinct geological 
epochs.

Art. I. On the Meteors seen in America on the Night of Nov. 13. 
1833. By the Rev. W. B. Clarke, A.M. F.G.S. (A Supple- 
ment to Mr. Clarke's Essay, No. 3., in p. 289 — 308., On certain 
recent Meteoric Phenomena, Vicissitudes in the Seasons, prevalent 
Disorders, S^c, contemporaneous, and in supposed connection, tvitk 
Volcanic Emanations.)

universitatis inquisitione non possumus, cum ita cohajrentia, connexa,

In the last number of my remarks on the supposed connec- 
tion of volcanic and other phenomena (p. 289---308.), I have 
attended to the extraordinary display of meteors on the night 
of Nov. 13. 1833, as described in Silliman's Journal ofScieiice 
and Arts, vol. xxv. p. 411. In vol. xxvi. p. 132. of that 
work, for April, 1 834, are '* Observations thereon, by Denison 
Olmsted, Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy 
in Yale College." 

Professor Olmsted sets out with quoting previous examples 
of meteorites seen at various periods. Amongst these, he 
alludes to several quoted by me, especially the meteors of Nov. 
19. 1832 *, seen in England ; the matter which fell at Wolo- 
kolumsk, March, 1832; the meteor of Brunck, Nov. 14. 
1832; and those seen by Humboldt, 'Nov. 12. 1794, in Cu- 
mana ; and the aerolites of Candahar. Others are, the fall of 
red rain in different countries, on Nov. 13. 1755, and in 
Picardy, Nov. 14. 1765; and a great meteor seen in Ohio, 
Nov. 1825; and that seen in England, Nov. 13. 1803. 

* By error, the date is before given, by me, Nov. 17. (p. 293.) ,* as is 
J728, for 1828 (p. 305.).

386 Meteors seen in America 

The testimony of an eyewitness is also adduced for the 
appearance of meteors, exactly resembling those in England, 
five days afterwards, at Mocha, on the Red Sea, where the 
same phenomena occurred, from 1 a.m. till after daylight, 
Nov. 14. 1832. (Amer, Journ,, xxvi. 136.) 

Professor Olmsted also mentions a shower of meteors seen 
in America about the middle of April, 1 803, which I have no 
hesitation in connecting with the shower of stones at L'Aigle, 
in France, April 26. 1803. (Mag, Nat. Hist., VII. 296.) 
The other examples of the professor are, I think, plainly 
to be referred at once to a volcanic origin, especially the 
black dust at Constantinople in 472, which, according to Pro- 
copius, was traced from Vesuvius. Additional information 
has been received that the meteors of 1833 were seen, contem- 
poraneously with the other localities, at Kingston, Jamaica ; 
in Mexico, in lat. 34° 30' n. ; and on the shores of Lake 
Huron. 

The explanation of the professor is most elaborately minute, 
and does no injustice to his celebrity as a calculator : but I 
must say that, if I were not attached to my own hypothesis, I 
could not agree in his upon his present showing. He assumes 
that the matter of which these meteors were composed is similar 
to that which composes the tails of comets, and that the 
meteors of 1799, 1832, and 1833 are results of the destruc- 
tion o^ one a.nd the. same body; and thence, by the aid of 
astronomical reasoning, deduces this conclusion : — " That the 
meteors of Nov* 1 3. consisted of portions of the extreme parts of 
a nebulous body, which revolves round the sun in an orbit in- 
terior to that of the earth, but little inclined to the plane of the 
ecliptic, having its aphelion near the earth^s path, and having 
a period in time of \^1 days nearly T 

I have neither time nor leisure,' at present, to examine here 
in detail the very ingenious, and apparently satisfactory, pro- 
cess by which these meteors are resolved into cometic frag- 
ments. I imagine that philosophers will find so many diffi- 
culties in the admission of the professor's theory, that he will 
not be able to maintain it. I would merely ask, if the appear- 
ances seen in such different places imply the object to be the 
same, why we may not include other similar displays in that 
comprehensive identity ? Why we may not suppose that the 
meteors, of precisely similar character, seen on August 10. 
1833, in Worcestershire, at 10 to 12 p.m.*, were cometic 
fragments ? How happens it that, if this comet has a motion 
from N.w. to s.E. (Prof Olmsted, p. 143.), the meteors seen at 
Mocha, on Nov. 14., made their appearance in England ^t;^

August, 1834. 



on the Night of Nov, 13. 1833. 387 

days after, in a directly contrary direction ? It is certainly pos- 
sible, and more than probable, that both occurrences had one 
origin; but, on Professor Olmsted's arguments, they could 
not, without involving difficulties of a serious nature. Surely 
he would not contend that the meteors seen by Sir W. Ha- 
milton in the electrical display on Vesuvius (VII. 301.) 
were otherwise than volcanic : — yet, why do we not call them 
cometic ? 

The whole argument of the professor rests on the general 
assumption that these displays of falling meteors are different 
from all others which have been denominated, and even by 
him, aerolites : now, evidence undoubtedly goes to establish 
their similarity. The singularity of these occurrences being 
so commonly about a particular day in November had pre- 
viously struck me, and certainly lends an air of probability to 
the professor's supposition. But periodicity is not, surely, 
confined to extra-terrestrial bodies. I shall, perhaps, have 
an opportunity of showing, in some future portion of my 
observations on the earth's derangements, that those disturb- 
ances obey a periodical law, and that, consequently, all their 
results obey the same impression. Professor Olmsted asserts 
that it is his belief that what has commonly been designated 
as the zodiacal light is identical with the light from his meteoric 
comet; and that the frequent displays of that light, recently, 
so correspond with the assigned position of the comet as to 
involve the identity of both. On this point I shall be silent: 
farther observation, and the eyes of astronomers, will be the 
best means of elucidating it. 

After having made these remarks, it is incumbent upon me 
to offer a few words in defence of my own previous attempt 
to explain the connection of the meteors with my subject. In 
order to bring the topic within my reach, I must quote from 
Professor Olmsted himself, who remarks that the meteors were 
directed to the earth in a shower from a cloud, which must 
have remained stationary a long time at a great height above 
the earth (p. 142.): he calculates, above 2238 miles, (p. 144.) 
I have always been of opinion, in which many persons will 
agree (see Mr. Lees, in The Analyst^ No. i. p. 36.), that phi- 
losophers are too apt to talk of hundreds and thousands, 
when, perhaps, units and tens would be nearer the mark. I 
allude expressly to the frequent mention of bodies entering 
the earth's atmosphere from tremendous heights. Is it actu- 
ally known what is the real height of the earth's atmosphere? 
and can any one define it ? It appears to me more probable 
that space is filled with atmosphere, denser, doubtless, towards 
all bodies moving therein ; and that it is not philosophical tq 

c c 2 



S8S Meteors seen in A7nerica 

suppose each planet to be surrounded by a particular atmo- 
sphere, independent of the rest of the universe, and fenced in 
by a kind of wall, which many expressions seem to imply. 
If space be filled, as it doubtless is, though we know nothing 
about it, by a universal atmosphere, bodies which are said now 
to fall from heights above our atmosphere may have been, in 
their original state, carried up by great heat into very lofty 
regions, even to a thousand miles. At any rate, it has not 
yet been shown that the heat generated in a volcanic erup- 
tion is not sufficiently powerful to produce such effects. And, 
on the other hand, it may be questioned whether bodies may 
not be in some measure displaced in vision by optical causes 
connected with the atmosphere. These speculations may 
seem absurd to such men as Professor Olmsted, with whom 
I have no pretension to dispute an argument : but, having 
taken a certain view of the subject, I do not like to abandon 
it hastily, and I have no reason to consider the meteors of 
1832 and 1833 as exceptions to the general character of 
meteoric bodies. 

The idea of a " cloud and shower " perfectly corresponds 
with the idea which we have of transported volcanic matter 
so discharged ; and, as to the effects produced, " the sudden 
cold," " the change of wind," &c., Professor Olmsted allows 
the same results to true aerolitic agency. (Amer. Jouim.^ 161.) 
I have already produced evidence (VII. 296.) to show that 
meteors are followed by such changes in the atmosphere, and 
no defender of cometic influence can gainsay that evidence. 

But it also appears that the western parts of the American 
continent were subjected to a " change of seasons," and that 
unusual isoarmth and mildness of weather prevailed on the 
shores of Lake Huron through the winter. (Mr. Schoolcraft 
in Amer. Journ., xxvi. 139.; see, also, Mr. Hildreth's 
paper in the same work, p. 85.) I shall, hereafter, bring 
forward some evidence upon this point, and show that a line 
of cold extended between two lines of "warmth during the 
late winter, which can only be accounted for in one way. 
That the meteors might, and did, modify for a time the states 
of the atmosphere, is probable ; but we might as rationally 
impute to them the state of weather in Europe, as the change 
of season in America. In both cases, those changes appear 
to me to depend on a cause to which the meteors themselves 
w^ere originally subject. I would not wish it to be inferred 
that a volcanic eruption, or emanations from the earth, must 
necessarily be immediately contemporaneous with meteoric ap- 
pearances. Volcanic vapours may float for a considerable 
time in space before they become sufficiently condensed to 
assume a solid form : and, again, it is very probable that such 



on the Night of Nov, 13. 1833. 389 

vapours may issue a long time before the actual outbreak of 
the volcano. I shall quit the subject, for the present, with 
this observation, that I have had so many examples before me 
of the intimate connection of atmospheric and telluric dis- 
turbances, as to feel inclined to admit it as established. In 
the present case, there is only an interval of eleven days 
between the appearance of the meteors in America, and the 
outbreak of Bocket Kaba, a volcano of Palambang (Nov. 24. 
1833). This eruption was most dreadful. The whole of Java 
was shaken by earthquakes, attended by inundations from a lake 
on the mountain called Telaga Ketjiel, which covered several 
hamlets to the depth of 21 ft., leaving a mud deposit 7 ft. 
thick. Kaba is 50 leagues from Palambang, and yet the 
water of the great river Moessie was not fit to drink for 
several weeks, owing to mephitic mixtures. Even as late as 
February, 1834-, there were floods and great rains; and Telo 
Mojo, a mountain of the province of Ngassinan, sank down 
in consequence. {Journal de la Haye.) I take one more cor- 
respondence, in illustration of the last of the professor's ex- 
amples of meteors. He quotes (p. 137.), from the Medical 
Gazette and New England Farmer of May 1. 1833, an ac- 
count of a shower of fire in the department of the Orne in 
France, seen at Caen and at Argenton, for two hours, one 
morning in the end of April. Earthquakes, &c., were very 
common about this time in various parts of the earth. Juasco 
and Coquimbo, in the west (on April 25.), were dreadfully 
shaken ; while, in the east, very early in April, the inhabitants 
of Manilla were alarmed by the sudden decrease of water in 
their river, attributed to a volcanic eruption in the interior. 
The water became green, unpleasant in odour, and could not 
be used. Pestilence was, in consequence, feared. (Canton 
Register, May 18. 1833.) On April 4. occurred an earth- 
quake at Vicenza ; on the 17th, a hurricane in lat. 28° s. 52° e. ; 
and at the end of the month, about the time of the others 
above named, earthquakes in Demerara. At this time, also, 
universal and unusual drought extended through the earth, 
occasioned, doubtless, by internal heat : Buenos Ayres lost 
2,000,000 head of catUe in consequence, while New South 
Wales and the Cape of Good Hope suffered in proportion. 
Europe also felt its effects. These facts may be considered 
extravagant illustrations ; but, surely, when it is known that 
the meteors of Nov. 14. 1833, at Brunck, were accompanied 
by aerolites (see VII. 293.), and by " falling stars" (Olmsted, 
in SilL Jour 71., 134.); and that such meteors have preceded, 
accompanied, and succeeded, earthquakes ; and that they have 
been seen over volcanoes (VII. 291, 292.), there is, I think, na

reason, as far as the evidence goes, to upset the theory of the 
zodiacal light, and bring so dangerous, though brilliant, a 
neighbour as this cometic gentleman seems to be. If I be 
wrong, and Professor Olmsted be right, the earth will in all 
probability enjoy the celestial carnival again in November, 
when meteors will fly about as sweetmeats and bon-bons do at

THE ox. 

In the earliest stages of society this valuable quadruped 
became an object of domestic care and regard ; for we read 
in Genesis (xiii. 6, 7.) that " there was a strife between the 
herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's 
cattle ; " the flocks of each of whom were so numerous " that 
the land was not able to bear them, and they could not dwell 
together." The ox was held sacred by the Egyptians, and 
elevated into one of the twelve signs of the zodiac (Taurus). 
A representation of the ox became an object of idolatrous 
worship, as in the golden calf erected by Aaron. (Ex- 
odus, xxxii.) At this day, in India, the sacred cow, as repre- 
senting one of the transformations of the deity, is held in the 
highest veneration, and the flesh forbidden to be eaten. The 
ox became, from associations like these, an acceptable offer- 
ing of propitiation or gratitude; as we find (Genesis, iv. 4.) 
that Abel offered in sacrifice the firstlings of his flock ; that 
Abram was directed (Genesis, xv. 9.) to sacrifice a heifer, 
of three years old, as an offering for the promise of a son; 
and that twenty- two thousand were sacrificed by Solomon at 
the dedication of the temple. (1 Kings, viii. 63.) The seven 
years of plenty and the seven years of want were typified by 
the fat and the lean kine of Pharaoh. (Genesis, xli.) 

Veal, it appears, was the first dressed meat upon record: 
for, when Abram entertained the three angels (Genesis, 
xviii. 7.)j " he ran into the herd, and fetched a calf tender 
and good, and gave it to a young man, and he hasted to dress 
it," The ox and the ass, as the most valuable represent- 
atives of pastoral possessions, are expressly forbidden, in the 
Tenth Commandment (Exodus, xx. 17.), to be unlawfully 
coveted from our neighbour : and the ox and the sheep were 
pointed out to Moses, from Mount Sinai, as the chief subjects 
pf sacrifice. (Exodus, xxix.)

A white bull was the most acceptable sacrifice among the 
Romans : but a black ox was considered as the emblem of 
misfortune; as we say of one who has been unlucky in his 
pursuits, that the black ox has set his foot upon him. And 
a man who has been bribed to silence is said to have an ox 
in his tongue, hos in lingua ; because the figure of an ox was 
stamped upon the Roman coin : and for this reason the word 
pecunia, or money, was derived from jjecus, or cattle. Europa 
was fabled to have been carried beyond sea by a bull, because 
Taurus, or the Bull, was the name of the ship by which she 
was conveyed. By the Roman law, the owner of a vicious 
bull was obliged to distinguish him by a bundle of hay tied to 
his horn ; whence the expression, " he has hay on his horn," 
as spoken of a dangerous or litigious man : " fcenum habet 
in cornu ; longe fuge." Of a bold adventurer we say, that 
he has taken the bull by the horns ; and of a petulant woman, 
that the curst cow has short horns. [In Exodus, xxi, 28 — 36., 
there are various compensations appointed to be made for 
injuries received from oxen by human beings or other oxen, 
as well as for injuries occasioned by man to oxen.] 

To plough with the heifei' means, to make a friend of the 
female sex : for when Samson lost his wager to the Philis- 
tines by the treachery of his wife, " If," said he, " ye had not 
ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle." 
(Judges, xiv. 18.) To chew the cud and to ruminate, ex- 
pressions figurative of deep and serious reflection, are taken 
from the placid and quiescent habits of this tribe of qua- 
drupeds. To bully and to cow, meaning to intimidate and 
overbear, are probably words taken from the menacing at- 
titudes of these animals when irritated : so coward, from them 
when in an opposite condition. Some, however, have sup- 
posed that the expression bully arose from the pope's bull, or 
threat of excommunication. And he who is compelled to 
retract unwarrantable pretensions is said to draw in his horns. 
Bull-feasts are probably remains of pagan sacrifice, or 
augurial rites ; at present a national and favourite amusement 
in Spain.

At once wound bulls and ladies' fancies ;

Bull-baiting was first introduced into England in the time 
of King John, and is supposed to be commemorative of the 
persecutions of Christians under the emperor Nero, who, 
among other species of torture, commanded them to be sewed 
up in the skins of wild beasts, and worried to death by dogs,

392 Origines Zoological, 

After this time, bull-baiting and cock-fighting became such 
general sports, and the feats and achievements of persons 
engaged in them were so commonly exaggerated and made 
the subject of discourse, that any tedious and bombast rela- 
tion is still called a cock and a bull story. From the great 
size of the bull, this last word, when formed into a com- 
parative composition^ means of larger bulk than usual; as, 
bull-rush, bull-head, bull-trout, bull-finch, bull-frog, bull- 
weed, buU-wark or bull-work, &c. : so, in Greek, boopis, from 
its circular shape, a round central spot in the target of archers, 
and a small aperture, covered with glass, in the deck of a 
ship, for the admission of light below, are called the bull's 
eye. A bull, or blunder, is said to have originated in the 
simplicity of an upland boor, who, when the village maidens 
went forth to milk the cows, himself took a pail, that he might 
milk the bull. 

It has been jocularly remarked that the clown in every 
country is nicknamed from the favourite dish of the people; 
as the Englishman, Jack Pudding and John Bull ; the French- 
man, Jean Pottage ; the Italian, Macaroni; the German, Hans 
Sausage ; and the Dutchman, Pickle Herring. The Welsh- 
man, in his pride of genealogy and his love of cheese, traces 
the cow to the line of Adam : — 

" Cheese was akin to Adam from hur birth ; 
Ap curds, ap milk, ap cow, ap grass, ap earth." 

By the laws of the Cambro-British legislator, Howel-dha, 
if a man betrayed a young woman, he was sentenced to place 
a bull in a stall with his tail soaped ; and if the damsel could 
draw him out by the tail, she was to have the bull for her 
pains. 

The arms of the city of Oxford are three oxen passing a 
ford, with the motto, " Ox on," underneath. This was for- 
merly finely represented in sculpture upon the ancient water- 
conduit at Carfax ; but which is now removed. And here it 
may not, perhaps, be impertinent to remark, that Carfax is a 
simple corruption of quatre vaux: it being the centre of 
four roads radiating in crossing directions. 

The bones of cattle slaughtered in London were formerly 
of such huge accumulation that it became necessary to con- 
sume them from time to time. This process was reserved for 
some holiday or period of public rejoicing, when faggots and 
combustible materials were collected from the neighbours for 
the purpose of illumination ; whence our term bonfire may 
mean either bone-fire, from the materials to be consumed, or 
boon-fire, from the gratuitous collections made for the pur-

pose.* Of a person whom it is intended not to encourage 
or spare, it is said, that we make no bones of him. 

The stealers of cattle have an ingenious method of twisting 
the horns of these in a direction so contrary to their natural 
position as to make it impossible that they can be identified 
by their owners. The cattle are concealed in caves under 
ground, and hot loaves of bread fastened successively on the 
horns, the heat and moisture of which soon render them mal- 
leable, when they are turned in any direction, and afterwards 
fixed and stiffened in their new position by cold water. 

The age of a cow is known by the horns, reckoning three 
years for the first circular wrinkle, and one for every ad- 
ditional wrinkle. It is remarkable that the Comte de Buffon, 
generally so accurate, should assert that the cow sheds her 
horns every three years. 

The ox, when alive, is the only horned quadruped which 
lends his labours to the service of man, except the rein-deer ; 
furnishing him also with the substantial luxuries of milk, 
cream, butter, cheese, and whey: and, besides its national 
[" the roast beef of old England "] and nourishing food, when 
dead, almost every part is convertible into some useful pur- 
pose. The skin makes a durable leather, useful for shoes, 
boots, and numberless conveniences of life ; and the fisher- 
men of Wales, Scotland, and some parts of Ireland still make 
use of the ancient coracle, or leather boat, the ribs of which 
are made of osiers, and covered with the hide of a bull. 
Vellum is made of calves' skins ; and Limerick gloves of 
the skin of such calves as are just dropped. The hair is 
mixed with lime as a necessary cement for mortar. The 
chippings of the hoofs, and fragments of the skin, make glue. 
Goldbeater's skin is made of the fine membrane which invests 
the larger intestines. Rennet for curdling the milk is made 
of the salted stomach of the calf, f Of the horns are made 
combs, spoons, powder-flasks, boxes, the handles of knives, 

[* What is the number of the animals of all kinds annually put to death 
in Great Britain, for the sake of their bodies as food for human beings ? 
This question was first incited in me by seeing a tanner superintending the 
preparation of a sufficient quantity of hair off the skins of animals, chiefly 
or wholly oxen, I presume, to cover a space of greensward of perhaps six 
poles by four. Men were turning this quantity over, and breaking asunder 
" the knotty and combined locks " which they found in it j exposing it to 
the drying action of the air ; and apparently endeavouring to get it free 
of lime which adhered to it. In the evening they collected it into conical 
heaps like little haycocks.]

The bones, besides being useful to mechanics where ivory 
would be too expensive, produce, when crushed, an excellent 
manure ; are essential in the formation of sal ammoniac and 
phosphorus ; produce an oil, much used by coach and harness 
makers, called neat's-foot oil ; and, when calcined, give a 
valuable test to the smelter and refiner. The gall is service- 
able to the chemist; the tallow contributes to give us light; 
and, above all, this noble quadruped has become sacred, as 
being the instrument of eradicating that loathsome disease 
the small-pox. From the noble sirloin of beef, as being the 
prince of joints, we say of a man who predominates over his 
companions, that he rules the roast. The H bone of beef, 
the derivation of which is not generally known, is a corruption 
of isch bone, from ischium, the hip or huckle-bone; and is so 
spelt, I believe, by the venerable Mrs. Glasse. 

It has been quaintly remarked, that most of our animals 
serving for food preserve their ancient Saxon names while 
living; but when they are dead and dressed their names 
immediately become French. Thus it is ox, calf, sheep, deer, 
pig, while alive ; but beef, veal, mutton, venison, pork, when 
served at table. This might arise from our neighbours 
having introduced among us a more savoury and tasteful art 
of cookery.

doubtless is, mostly, I believe, a bullock's horn. Gray has, in his " Elegy 
written in a Country Churchyard," given record of this pleasing rural cus- 
tom, and of some sweet associations of early morning which must ever 
keep it company.

THE SHEEP. 

Of equal antiquity in a domesticated state with the ox, 
forming the pastoral wealth of the children of Adam, and the 
earliest oblation of grateful acknowledgment in sacrifice : 
for the accepted offering of Abel consisted in the firstlings of 
his flock (Genesis, iv. 4.) ; and a hundred and twenty thou- 
sand were sacrificed at the dedication of the temple by Solo- 
mon. (1 Kings, viii. 6SJ) 

Of an animal so serviceable to man, and so constantly 
before his eyes, many familiar allusions have become con- 
sequently popular and common. From his mild and un- 
meaning aspect *, a vacant or silly look is said to be sheepish ; 
and a swain, when he affects tender glances to the village 
maiden, is said to cast sheep's eyes at her : and we say of a 
man unworthily tricked of his property, that he has been 
fleeced, f A tyrant who exercises his cruelties under the 
garb of gentleness is called a wolf in sheep's clothing. 

The horn of the ram was an early instrument of martial 
and ceremonial music, at whose sound the walls of Jericho 
fell down (Joshua, vi.) : and the jubilee of old (Leviticus, xxv.) 
was ushered in with the sound of rams' horns, or the jubilee 
trumpets ; for the word jobul, or yobul, in Hebrew means a 
ram : so our curved and sonorous field instrument is called a 
horn. The ram was chosen by the angel as a substitute for 
Isaac, whom his father Abraham was commanded to sacrifice 
in proof of his obedience. (Genesis, xxii. 13.) Jacob, for a 
wife, kept sheep twice seven years (Genesis, xxix.) ; and 
Moses kept the flock of his father-in-law Jethro. (Exodus, 
iii. 1.) Jason is fabled to have carried away the golden fleece 
from Colchis, in the ship Argo, by the help of the sorceress 
Medea, as representative of the extension of commerce, and 
the transfer of the arts ; and the fleece of Gideon was the 
miraculous instrument by which he had assurance of the 
victory of the forces of Israel, led by him, over the Midianites, 
who then oppressed Israel. (Judges, vi. 33 — 40.) 

In the reign of Nero the converts to Christianity were 

* [It seems to be generally agreed that the face of the sheep is not 
expressive of any greater sentiment than that of mildness ; but Henry 
Selwyn, in a small volume of published poems, has a tenderly sentimental 
heroine, who, in her sensitive exercise of this feeling, does 

" try a character to trace 

In every sheep's unconscious face : " 

and it may be remarked that the various faces observable in a flock of sheep 
exhibit a consid n-able variety of expression.]

sewn up in sheepskins and goatskins, and torn to pieces by 
dogs ; or in this state exposed to the heat of the sun or a slow 
fire, which, by gradually shrinking and shriveling the skin of 
the animal in which they were straitly enclosed, exposed them 
to still more exquisite and lingering tortures. 

In the ruins of Persepolis were found the statues and 
figures of rams, which formed one of the astronomical signs 
at the commencement of the year, when ewes yean : and it 
was the ensign of the tribe of Gad. The lamb is an emblem 
of spotless innocence and patience, the symbol of the pass- 
over, and the type of the Redeemer of man ; and a vast 
slaughter of these unresisting victims is annually made on 
Good Friday, for the feast of Easter day : and a smooth 'and 
pleasant drink is called lamb's-wool. The Bachelors of Ox- 
ford, who determine their degrees at Lent, wear lambskin 
hoods, emblematical of the innocence of the calling they are 
about to adopt ; for all learning, and all learned occupations, 
were formerly confined to the clergy. This hood is at present 
degraded into a strip of flannel. 

The age of the sheep is known by the teeth : and an old 
ewe who has lost her teeth is called a crone ; a term applied, 
in low language, to a disgusting old woman. A sheep two 
years old is called a hog; the double acceptation of which 
term occasioned the following ridiculous mistake. A com- 
mercial gentleman, not much acquainted with husbandry, ap- 
plied to an agricultural friend for the best means of bringing 
upon his newly laid lawn a fine clothing of herbage, and was 
advised to have it eaten down by a score of hogs. Unaware 
of its less common meaning as applicable to sheep of a cer- 
tain age, and taking it in its more usual sense, he purchased a 
score of large pigs ; and, to his very great surprise and mor- 
tification, soon discovered that his lawn was totally scarified 
and rooted up. About the neck of the oldest wether of the 
flock is often fastened a bell, to gather them together, or to 
Conduct the herdsman to their place of pasture ; whence a 
noisy and brawling woman is called a bell-wether or bel- 
dame. * The Romans used battering rams in their sieges ; 
and our terms ram and ramrod seem to have their origin 
from this source. Of a person of indifferent character, and 

* [Rams fight most desperately. The noise produced by the concussion 
of their heads may be heard at a great distance. They would seem to 
proceed to fighting with great suddenness, as if the sentiment of aversion 
were fixed, and prompted them to battle at sight. I infer this from Shak- 
speare's remark in As You Like It: — " Never was there anything so sud- 
den, except the battle of two rams."]

who may be suspected to corrupt his companions, we say that 
one scabby sheep infects the whole flock. 

By the Israelitish women the wool was spun into garments, 
and formed a part of their offering to the sanctuary. In 
good and olden times, the maidens of the family spun the 
wool of their flocks; whence unmarried women are deno- 
minated spinsters; and, in heraldry, bear their arms, not in 
a warlike shield, like men, but in a lozenge having a resem- 
blance to the outline of a spindle or distaff charged with 
worsted. 

The celebrated morocco leather is made of the skins of 
rams dyed red. It is probably the most ancient of manufac- 
tures, and has formed an uninterrupted article of commerce 
for nearly four thousand years. With this was formed a 
covering for the tabernacle in the wilderness, in the days of 
Moses (Exodus, xxv. 5.; xxvi. 14.); and with this was deco- 
rated the celebrated shrine of Minerva, at the Lake Tritonis : 
and with this are covered, at the present day, our most costly 
tables and books. The wool of the sheep is considered of 
such inestimable importance to the comforts and commerce of 
our own country, that the Lord Chancellor of the realm sits 
on a woolsack in the House of Lords, as the staple commodity 
of the kingdom ; and the funeral garments of deceased bodies 
are by law directed to be made exclusively of woollen. 

The value of wool, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, may be 
ascertained by the clown in Shakspeare's As you like it, who, 
in estimating his market produce, says, " Every eleven wether 
tods, every tod yields pound and odd shilling, fifteen hundred 
shorn, what comes the wool to?" 

The occupation of collecting scattered flocks of wool from 
hedges and brakes was considered so mean and miserable, 
that it is said of a person not quite settled in his ideas, that 
his wits are gone wool-gathering. Its valuable uses in various 
garments, in flannels, in blankets, in broadcloth, and all 
materials requiring warmth, are sufficiently well known : the 
coarser lumps, called flocks, are used to stuff mattresses. The 
skins of the sheep make parchment and covering for books ; 
and the skins of lambs a finer kind of gloves. 

THE HOG. 

The emblem of filth, sloth, obstinacy, gluttony, and bru- 
tality : abhorred by the natives of warm climates as unclean, 
and subject to scrofula and leprous disorders of the skin. 
Hogs are highly sensible of the approach of foul weather, 
and run about in great agitation before storms, screaming, 
grunting, and snuffing up the air ; whence they are said to 



398 Orighies ZoologioB, 

*' see the wind." Hogs are of exceedingly rapid growth, and 
as, when killed, their flesh takes salt more readily than the 
flesh of other animals, they form a valuable part of the husband- 
man's stock, and one of the principal objects of sale in a country 
fair : so, when a man has made a successful bargain, he is said 
to have brought his hogs to a fair market. Stubborn and in- 
flexible obstinacy is likened to the casting of pearls before 
swine ; and of indocible stupidity it is said, " Ne sus Miner- 
vam," You cannot make a silken purse of a sow's ear. 

In some parts of the East, they were, nevertheless, objects 
of pastoral care and attention, if not of commerce : for the 
herd of swine, into which the evil spirits were suffered to 
enter, were under the care of feeders. (Matthew, viii. 28 — 34. 
[So in the parable of the Prodigal Son. (Luke, xv. 15.) 3 
They are very gregarious, and in the wild and vast forests of 
Germany collect together in great herds; and persons who 
are closely packed in society are said to pig together. Hogs, 
like many animals in a state of domestication, bring several 
litters in a year, and at all seasons, from the abundance of 
food and accommodation which can be afforded them, as may 
also be observed of dogs, cats, rabbits, poultry, doves, cows, 
and sheep. When caught, they are seized by the ear or lug, 
and make a most noisy outcry : whence of a person who has 
fastened his suspicions on a wrong object, it is said, that he 
has taken the wrong sow by the ear. 

The side or flitch, when salted and dried, makes bacon ; 
and as this savoury food too frequently becomes the plunder of 
rats, bats, and other vermin*, it is said of him who has barely 
escaped a loss or an injury, that he has just saved his bacon. 
The smoking of hams is as old as Horace, who considered a 
hock of bacon and greens as fit food for a country farmer. 

" Temere edi 

Quidquara praeter olus, fumosae cum pede pernae." 

The boar, when in anger, foams at the mouth, gnashes his 
teeth, and whets his tusks. f We learn that, at the tables of 
the Roman epicures, the flesh of the boar, together with the 
turbot, or probably the halibut, was considered as rank, and 
not fit to be served up, till it had been kept a long time : 
*' putet aper rhombusque recens :" and again, " rancidum 
aprum antiqui laudabant." [Brawn's flesh, skilfully prepared, 
is, at our own tables, an esteemed and somewhat expensive 
kind of food.] 

* [One of these is the larva of the insect Dermestes lardarius.]

his tusks in time of peace, that he might be prepared for the most sudden 

presentment of war.} 



or Zoological Recollections* 399 

St. Anthony was the patron of swine, and celebrated for 
curing such diseases of the skin as were considered to be of 
swinish origin or nature, as leprosy, scrofula, and erysipelas, 
or Saint Anthony's fire. His monks were thence called, in 
derision, St. Anthony's pigs ; and thence originated the 
ironical taunt of " please the pigs ;" and, as the gambols of 
young swine are singularly awkward, any frolic more than 
usually ridiculous was compared to a " tantony pig," and a 
stupid rustic was called a tony. In the monkish legends, it 
is related, that, when St. Anthony was once sorely beset 
by the temptations of Satan, he defied him by commanding 
him to shear his hogs ; who, finding them more clamorous and 
troublesome than productive, exclaimed, that there was great 
cry and little wool. 

Swine, if they are fed on fermented grains, or the must of 
cider, are subject to fits of the gout ; and in large distilleries 
get rapidly fat and bloated, by being kept in a state of con- 
stant intoxication. The hog, although apparently shapeless 
and unwieldy, is of considerable swiftness and agility : for the 
hind legs have two bones in each, whereas there is but one in 
horned cattle. 

The hog, as a beast of chase, forms the armorial bearing of 
many families. It constituted the arms of King Richard the 
Third : and in his reign, when great enormities were com- 
mitted by himself, RatclifF, Catesby, and Lovel whose crest 
was a talbot or kind of hound, an unhappy wit was hanged 
for the following not inelegant pasquinade : — 

" The rat, the cat, and Lovel the dog. 
Govern all England under the hog." 

In his reign the English coin was first introduced into Ire- 
land, whence an English shilling is in the sister island still 
called a hog: and after his reign, the popular sign of the 
hog in armour probably originated, in allusion to his un- 
shapely person and his arms or crest. The bristles are made 
into brushes ; and the skin of the wild boar is used in Spain 
to hold wine, whence the origin of our word hogshead, a cor- 
ruption of hog's hide. 

In the casting of metallic ores, the red-hot fusion runs from 
the furnace down a straight groove, and branches on each 
side into shorter ones, supposed by the workmen to resemble 
a sow suckling her litter ; whence the longer piece is called 
the sow, and the shorter ones pig iron or pig lead. 

A learned monk wrote a long poem in praise of pigs, 
every word of which begins with the letter P : — 
" Plaudite porcelli porcorum pigra propago." 



400 Oiigines Zoologicce^ 

Although the flesh of the hog is held in abhorrence by the 
Jew and the Turk, no other animal affords so large a series 
of savoury viands to the table of the Christian. Every part 
is in use, except the brains and the marrow, which, from 
ancient prejudice, are thought to create melancholy. The 
smaller intestines make chitterlings, and the ears are made 
into souse ; as it was said of the fiddler Crowdero, — 

" His warped ear hung o'er the strings, 
Which was but souse to chitterlings ; 
For guts, some write, ere they are sodden, 
Are fit for music or for pudden." Hudibras. 

The sides of the head are made into cheeks, and the tongue 
is pickled. The neck or collar makes brawn ; whence any- 
thing strongly muscular is called brawny. Of the shoulders 
are made gammons and blade-bones ; of the back-bone are 
made the chine and the griskin ; the thinner portion of the 
ribs forms the sparerib ; the sides and the belly make the 
flitch and the rasher; the hind legs make the ham and the 
hock ; the feet of the sucking pig make petit-toes ; of the 
heart, the liver, and the lights, with morsels from the throat, 
are made the harslet or fry ; of the spare lean parts are made 
sausages ; the larger intestines, stuffed with grits mixed with 
the blood make black-puddings. 

" And fat black-puddings, proper food 
For men that most delight in blood." Hudibras, 

The bristles are made into brushes, and point the waxed 
thread of the shoemaker. 

THE BEAR. 

Rough as a bear, may be taken either from the coarseness 
of his coat, or the rudeness of his embrace ; for, being fur- 
nished with collar bones, he is able to climb, and presses his 
adversary to death by the closeness of his hug : and he, whose 
manners are unpolished and his actions unmannerly, is said 
to be rude as a bear. He was made the instrument to avenge 
the insult to the prophet, by the mockery of the children, and 
destroyed forty-two of them. (2 Kings, ii. 24.) In the winter, 
when his food is hardly to be procured, he becomes sleepy, 
and partially torpid, rolled up, with the paws before his 
mouth, that they may be kept warm by the breath, whence 
he is said to suck, " or quarter upon, his own paws." * At 
one time, it was thought that the young were brought forth 
a mere shapeless mass, which the dam brought into proper 

* [See, in the Entomological Magazincy i. 327 — 332., an account of the 
winter habits of bears in Russia; and in Mag. Nat. Hist., VI. 510., a short

form by her licking. [Hence it is, probably, that to give rude 
sketches professional touches is expressed by ** to lick them 
into shape."] The bear was taught to dance by putting boots 
on his hind legs, and placing him on a floor made hot, thus 
forcing him to lift up his fore feet, and stand erect; and a 
rough staff was placed in his paws for support, and to defend 
himself against the dogs, which were let loose upon him. 
The amusement of bear-baiting constituted a favourite pastime 
of our unpolished forefathers. It formed a part of the sports 
selected by the Earl of Leicester for the amusement of Queen 
Elizabeth, when she visited Kenilworth Castle. The places 
where this sport was exhibited were generally pointed out by 
the sign of the bear and ragged staff'. For this purpose a 
bear was formerly kept in enclosures called bear-gardens, 
and, when it was baited, was tied to a stake or post ; procla- 
mation was then made, that no one should come nearer than 
40 ft. Now, the amusement consisted in endeavouring to 
make him angry, and quit his post or stake, and be worried 
by men and dogs ; whence the expression, stake or venture ; 
and post, in allusion to an employment or office ; as, he has 
lost his post, or keeps his post, and cannot be turned out.* 
To pluck a bear by the beard was considered a hardy act of 
venturous and manly courage ; and Master Slender boasts 
to his sweet Anne Page, that he has seen Sackerson loose 
twenty times, and taken him by the chain. Any assemblage 
of riot and confusion is now compared to a bear-garden ; and, 
among the noisy money-brokers of the Stock Exchange, the 
speculators for a rise in the funds are called bulls, and those 
who calculate on a fall are called bears. 

THE FOX. 

Cunning as a fox, is truly exemplificative of the manners 
of this sly and crafty animal, whose shifts and tricks of fraud 
and evasion are too well known in the farmyard and among 
hen-roosts, f That all traces of his progress might be lost, 

* [" Lucrative offices are seldom lost 

For want of powers proportion'd to the post: 
Give e'en a dunce the employment he desires, 
And he soon finds the talents it requires ; 
A business with an income at its heels 
Furnishes always oil for its own wheels." 

Cow PER 's Retirement. 

Does not a desire for an employment argue an affection towards it, and, 
consequently, some fitness for it ? ] 

f [A fox was fastened with a long chain to a post in a court, where he 
was fed with, among other things, potatoes. Tiiese, the animal was seen 

Vol. VII. —No. 41. dd 



402 Origines Zoologicce, 

he was formerly supposed to sweep out the marks of his foot- 
steps with his tail : and even to simulate death, to delude his 
pursuers. 

" And as a fox, with hot pursuit 

Chased through the warren, cast about 

To save his credit, and among 

Dead vermin on a gallows hung ; 

And while the dogs ran underneath. 

Escaped by counterfeiting death." Hudibras. 

^sop has left us the fable of the fox and the grapes ; whence 
of disappointed hopes we say that the grapes are sour : and 
when some degree of art and management, as well as deci- 
sion, is considered essential to the accomplishment of an 
object, it is said, that we must eke out the lion's skin with the 
fox's tail. 

With three hundred foxes, tied in pairs by the tail, and a 
firebrand placed between each pair, Samson burnt the stand- 
ing corn of the Philistines, who kept from him his wife 
(Judges, XV.) : but it is probable that the hyaena, a very 
common beast in the East, was the animal here meant. The 
female of the fox is called foxen, or fixen, whence the 
name vixen is applied in reproach to a woman of a wayward 
or spiteful temper. 

THE HARE. 

Timid and solitary, the emblem of melancholy among the 
Egyptians, and therefore considered as the forerunner of ill 
luck, if she crossed our path. By the law of the Sabians, if 
any one called another a hare, he was obliged to compound 
for the injury, by the payment of a large fine, as the name 
was considered to be synonymous with coward ; and he who 
indulges in wild and improbable fancies is called hare- 
brained. * 



to bruise and scatter about^ mostly within reach : he then retired, in an op- 
posite direction, to the full length of his chain. The object of this con- 
trivance was to decoy a number of fowls that were accustomed to enter 
the court, but which were usually so much attentive to their own safety as 
to defeat the various stratagems of reynard. When, however, some had 
become so much off their guard as to venture within the circle of danger, 
the fox was seen to spring from his lurking-place across the diameter of 
the circle, and seize his prey. 

The fox, when hunted, never runs through a gate ; nor does it cross a 
hedge, in a smooth and even part, but chooses the roughest spot, where 
briars and thorns abound, and mounts the eminence, not straight forwar(f 
as a hare does, but obliquely, scrambling up, not springing over it. — 
J. Couch. PolperrOy Cornwall. {Beceived June 11. 1834.)]

faculty of being " harebrained" estimable. He, in sketching the character-

It was formerly thought that she changed her sex every 
month, and was probably forbidden for this reason to be 
eaten by the ancient Britons. She was also one of the favourite 
transformations of the witch, from her silence and facility of 
escape. 

To hunt and course the hare have ever been considered as 
favourite and joyous sports of the field : and into the social 
drinking-bowl, after the feast, the foot or the scut of the 
victim of the chase was cast; whence he that comes too late 
to enjoy the viands is said to kiss the hare's foot ; and any 
indirect or roundabout way of obtaining information is called 
to beat about the bush. A true sportsman is said never to 
taste his game: and Horace informs us, that the Roman 
huntsman disdained to touch the hare when set before him. 

" Leporem venator iit alta 

In nive sectatur, positum sic tangere nolit." 

Martial considers her as a favourite dish among these luxu- 
rious people. 

" Inter quadrupedes gloria prima lepus.'* 

And Horace tells us that the shoulder was thought the best 
part : — 

" Fcecundi leporis sapiens sectabitur armos." 

And again : — 

" Et leporum avulsos, et multo suavius, armos." 

A German quack doctor, when his patient was surfeited by 
eating too much hare, upon the principle of antipathy, directed 
him to take greyhound broth. 

Moses supposed the hare to be a ruminant animal, and 
forbade her to be eaten : *' the hare, because he cheweth the 
cud, but divideth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you." 
(Leviticus, xi. 6.) But what has been supposed to be the 
rumination of the hare and the rabbit, is not the chewing the 
cud proper and peculiar to cattle which have four stomachs, 
from one of which stomachs the cud or ball of hair is 
projected at pleasure into the mouth, and swallowed back 
again ; but merely the bringing forward a portion of the food 
from the cheeks, where such animals as have round mouths, 

istlcs of " some Scottish Muse," whom he has fully described in his Vision, 
says of her — 

" A * hare-brained sentimental trace,* 
Was strongly marked in her face ; 
A wildly witty rustic grace 

Shone full upon her ; 
Her eye, e'en turn'd on empty space, 
Beam'd keen wi' honour."]

and cheeks more or less dilatable, and capable of being formed 
into pouches, are enabled to preserve a portion of their food 
to be brought forward for occasional mastication. 

The fur of the hare and the rabbit is much used in the 
manufacture of hats. 

Of Ruminating Animals, or, as they are commonly called, 
cattle; it may here be remarked, that they form a truly 
natural division, and were, in the earliest formation of social 
manners, pointed out by Moses as exclusively, among qua- 
drupeds, constituting the proper food of man. " Whatsoever 
parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, 
among the beasts, that shall ye eat." (Leviticus, xi. 3.) From 
all other quadrupeds they are distinguished by peculiarities 
so characteristic as to remove all difficulty of identification, 
in a wild or domesticated state, in the living animal or the 
dead carcass. It was remarked by Aristotle, that such of 
them as have horns have no tusks, and such of them as have 
tusks have no horns. Destined to graze upon the herbage 
of pastures, they have no front teeth in the upper jaw ; and, 
as the head is constantly in an inclined posture, during the 
time they are feeding, the neck is supported on each side by 
a strong and remarkably tough ligament, called vvhitleather, 
or white-leather [called, at table, packwax]. The hunter, in 
search of food, may at once distinguish them from impure 
quadrupeds, or such as are not usually fit to be eaten, if he 
can see them in a recumbent or crouching posture; for the 
whole of this tribe rise from the ground with the hind feet 
first, and all other quadrupeds with the fore feet first: 
that is, a cow or a sheep first lifts up the hinder parts, with 
the knees of the fore-legs on the ground ; but the horse and 
the dog first lift up the fore parts, with the front hoofs on the 
ground, and then the hind parts. This may possibly be oc- 
casioned by the weight of the four stomachs, with which all 
ruminating quadrupeds are furnished. The internal fat of all 
this tribe is hard, and called suet, sufficiently consistent to 
make candles ; while that of all others is of a softer and more 
oily consistence. [That of the bear is now known to most 
by the name of bear's grease ; and that of the hog is familiar 
to all by the name of pork lard, or pork seam.] 

AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. 

A tribe intermediate, as it were, between the inhabitants of 
land and water, possessing properties in some measure com- 
mon to both, and often peculiar to themselves. The body is 
cold, and slow of motion, the countenance stern and ex- 
tremely expressive ; with the senses of sight and hearing of 



or Zoolomcal Recollections, 405 



-to 



exquisite acuteness. They are able to live an incredible time 
without food, and in an atmosphere highly noxious to animal 
life: and are so tenacious of life, that, if the head be cut off, 
or the chest opened, they survive many days; and have even 
the power of reproducing parts which have been destroyed or 
lost. Instead of bones, the skeleton consists of cartilage. 

All the horrible fables of antiquity seem to be taken from 
this singular class of beings. Satan, when he tempted the 
parent of mankind, put on the form of the wily serpent, the 
most dreadful of all created beings ; or sometimes appeared, 
as represented by Milton, " squat like a toad." The siren 
was a kind of lizard, supposed to possess a voice of such ex- 
quisite attraction as to entice its hearers within its reach to 
their destruction : and the crocodile, at certain seasons, utters, 
in the night, sobs and cries of bewailing, so bitter and pathetic 
as to imitate the most distressing lamentations of human 
misery and woe ; and is hence fabled to weep and shed tears 
over her victims : affected appearances of grief are hence 
called crocodile's tears. The chameleon is said to live on air, 
from its long endurance of life without food ; and to change 
its colour at pleasure, because its naked shining body reflects 
various hues, according to the change of its position in the 
light. The salamander, another kind of lizard, is reported 
to resist the power of fire, and even to quench it, because, 
Yike many of its tribe, the body is extremely cold, and covered 
with a slimy exudation. The basilisk, or cockatrice, a spe- 
cies of serpent, was thought to be of such malignancy of vision, 
as suddenly to destroy those upon whom it fastened its eyes. 

THE BADGER. 

This animal, which burrows generally in the side of a hill, 
is to be found throughout Great Britain, but is particularly 
abundant in Scotland. When attacked it emits a fetid odour, 
which appears to be the effect of fright, rather than as in- 
tended as a means of defence. So intolerably offensive is 
this odour, that it has passed into a proverb, which is applied 
to any peculiarly disagreeable smell. The colour of the 
coat is greyish brown, whence we say of a person whose 
hair begins to show signs of old age, that he is as grey as a 
badger. 

Baiting the badger with dogs is still a common diversion; 
and hence originates the phrase of badgering a person, ap- 
plied in cases where one is made the butt of many. Its skin 
is so loose and tough, that the dogs can make but little im- 
pression on the animal, except upon the belly, which sensi- 
tive part the animal guards with such extreme care that it

never designedly exposes it to its pursuers. From this cir- 
cumstance, and the inimitable manner in which, notwithstand- 
ing the molestation which it receives, it counterfeits death, in 
order to deceive its enemies, we say of a person notorious 
for duplicity, that he is as sly as a badger. 

THE HAWK. 

This bird, from its having been one of those animals which 
afforded our ancestors so much amusement in the field, has 
furnished us with many similes. We will pass over the 
keenness of his vision, so universally known, and throw light 
upon a passage in Shakspeare's Hamlet, which has hitherto 
puzzled all the commentators on the grand master of the 
drama. The phrase we allude to is the tbllowing : — «•' I am 
not so mad but I know a hawk from a hand-saw." There 
appearing no connection between the two objects of compa- 
rison, a reading, which has been universally adopted, and 
which is very ingenious, is, '* a hawk from a heronshaw^* 
[see IV. 425.]; but the hawJc of Shakspeare is not the 
bird; it is ihdit Jlat board vf'iih a handle centrally fixed on 
the lower surface, which is used to this day by masons for 
smoothing the plastering of a wall, and which still retains 
that appellation. The comparison, therefore, is between two 
operative implements. [For this solution, which restores the 
original text, we are indebted to an oral communication from 
Dr. Turton.] 

The hawk, from its rapacious habits, has received its 
Latin name, accipiter, and was held in dislike by the Roman 
poet : — 

" Odimus accipitrem quia semper vivit in armis." 

A hawk that happened to be once beaten, was ever after- 
wards effectually cowed, and was technically termed a craven ; 
whence the appellation has been transferred to a person 
eminent for pusillanimity, as being the most bitter term of 
reproach that can be employed. * 

THE DOVE, OR PIGEON. 

From the most ancient records that we possess, we find 
this bird has ever been considered as the emblem of peace 

[* The terra " craven " has also, it seems, been applied to the rook : 
some poet has these lines : — 

" The craven rook, and pert jackdaw. 
Though neither birds of moral kind. 
Yet serve, when hang'd, and stufF'd with straw. 
To tell from which point blows the wind."] 



or Zoolojorical Recollectio7is. 407 



"to 



and innocence *, and has moreover been early employed as a 
carrier. The first person that ever made this use of the 
pigeon appears to be Noah, who despatched one from the 
windows of the ark, in order to ascertain whether the waters 
of the deluge had subsided. When it was nearly time for 
the patriarch to quit the ark, the dove returned with an olive 
leaf in her bill, as a token of reconciliation between the 
offended majesty of heaven and the sons of men ; and, on 
being sent forth a third time, she returned no more. (Genesis, 
viii. 8 — 12.) In the book of Leviticus, Moses commanded 
that for a sin-offering a man should bring a lamb or a kid, 
the one the type of the Lamb of God, and the other emblem- 
atical of the great scape-goat of mankind ; but, should he be 
disabled by poverty from offering either of these, the remain- 
ing means of atonement for the sinner was " a pair of turtle 
doves, or two young pigeons." (Leviticus, v. 6, 7.) Our Sa- 
viour beautifully alludes to the gentle disposition of the dove, 
when he cautions his disciples on this wise, " Be ye therefore 
wise as serpents, but harmless as doves." (Matthew, x. 16.) 
And the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Redeemer, at 
his baptism, was in the form of a dove. (Matthew, iii. 16.) 

The term of pigeoning, or over-reaching, a person, origi- 
nated in a practice common amongst sharpers, at a period 
when the qualities of this bird as a carrier were not generally 
known, of employing pigeons for the rapid transmission of 
news connected with the sporting world. A rogue by these 
means was accurately informed of the result of any important 
match for some time previous to its being communicated by 
the accustomed channel, and was thus enabled to lay his bets 
with certainty; and the phrase has been carried still farther 
by the application of the term of plucking a pigeon, meaning 
the depriving a person of all that he is worth by sharping. 

* [Shenstone, in his pathetic "Pastoral Ballad, in Four Parts," has these 
delightful lines : — 

" I have found out a gift for my fair ; 

I have found where the wood pigeons breed ; 
But let me that plunder forbear, 

She will say 't was a barbarous deed. 

For he ne'er could be true, she averr'd. 

Who could rob a poor bird of its young ; 
And I loved her the more, when I heard 

Such tenderness fall from her tongue. 
I have heard her with sweetness unfold 

How that pity was due to a dove ; 
That it ever attended the bold. 

And she calfd it the sister of love."]

408 Natural Historic of Mollmcciis Animals : — 

To this day a roast pigeon is occasionally served up at the 
table of sharpers, as emblematical of the profession. Fifty 
or sixty years ago, it was customary to cast off a carrier pigeon 
at Tyburn, immediately that a criminal was turned off, in 
order to give the earliest information of the event to the 
surviving relatives. 



Art. hi. Ati Introduction to the Natural History of Molluscous 
Animals. In a Series of Letters. By G. J. 

Letter 14. On their Food and Digestive Oi'gans: Carnivorous 

Mollusca, 

Although it may be true, as stated in the preceding letter, 
[p. 218—224.], that the great proportion of the Conchifera 
subsist on food in a state of molecular division, yet there can 
be no doubt that some of the larger and locomotive species 
seek a more substantial fare, and feed on worms or other 
animal matter in a state of partial decay ; which they seem to 
have the power of grasping by means of their extensible 
labial appendages. Thus the large Cyprina islandica and the 
Modiola vulgaris of our seas very often swallow the bait of 
our fishermen, and in the stomach of an individual of the 
former I once found the undigested remains of a large green 
Nereis enveloped in a pulp too consistent certainly to have 
been the sediment from water, however loaded with molecules. 
In their manner of feeding, these Conchifera resemble the 
pectinibranchial gasteropodes whose shells have a notch or canal 
at the base of their apertures; and it is important you should 
remember that it is only, with a few exceptions, the gastero- 
podes of this order (Pectinibranchia) so circumstanced that 
are truly carnivorous. They embrace the Cyprae^«<^£r, the 
cones, the volutes, the rock shells and the whelks, all of 
which live on animal food, and it seems to be indifferent to 
them whether their prey is dead, or still fresh and alive ; but, in 
the latter case, it is obvious, if you remember the inactivity, 
and sluggishness, and total want of cunning, of these molluscs, 
that the prey they can master must be fettered and stationary, 
or endowed with locomotive powers and arms not superior to 
their own. It is not unlikely that they may prefer a dead 
prey to a living one, for we know that the whelks will take a 
bait readily, and they frequently enter the baskets laid for 
crabs and lobsters, which are always baited with garbage ; 
while in tropical climes w^e are told that they fish for the olives 
with lines, to which small nooses, each containing a piece of 
the arms of a cuttlefish, are appended. 



their Food and Digestive Ch'gans. 409 

You could never have anticipated that the Bivalved Mol- 
liisca (ConchiFera) would be found among the prey of these 
carnivorous tribes, than which there are apparently no animals 
less fitted to gain access to their strong-holds, so that even 
Blainville has expressed himself incredulous on the point. 
But the fact is certain, and has been known since the time of 
Aristotle {Hist. Anim., lib. iv. cap. iv. sect. ]48-9.); nor, in- 
deed, is it hastily to be believed that such an improbable state- 
ment would have been made by the Stagyrite, had it not rested 
on personal observation. The Purpuras prove extensively 
destructive to muscles and other littoral bivalves : the J5uccina 
feed upon those which burrow in sand in somewliat deeper 
water ; and it is very probable, considering the similarity of 
their organisation, that all the whelks and rock shells, and per- 
haps all the pectinibranchial zoophagous gasteropodes, have 
the same taste, and an equal capacity of gratifying it. How, 
you ask, and by what means ? Do they glide insidiously, and 
pop a stone between the valves, to prevent their closure ? or 
do they venture slily to insinuate their foot, and seize upon 
the unwary inmate ? The first they cannot do, and the latter 
I should deem a hazardous attempt ; but nevertheless it is 
affirmed that the ^uccinum undatum really runs the hazard 
in its attacks upon the clam (Pecten opercularis), to which it 
bears a great enmity.* This is not, however, their usual 
method, which is — what you might never guess — by boring 
a hole in one valve through which they reach their miserable 
victim. On examining a number of valves of dead shells, 
of Mactrae and Anatina? especially, you will perceive in many, 
and generally near the beaks, a small circular hole drilled 
with a neatness that the gimlet of the artisan could not more 
than emulate; and these holes are the workmanship of the 

* " Is commonly taken in dredging by fishermen, who either use the 
animal for bait, or destroy it, from a supposition that it is very destructive 
to the hirge scollop, Pecten maximus, by insinuating its tail (as it is 
termed) into the shell, and destroying the inhabitant : this, we have been 
assured, they will do even in a pail of sea water." (Mont. Test. Brit,, 
p. 238.) The mode in which they anciently fished for the Piirpurae proves 
the danger. " Now these purples are taken with small nets, and thinne 
wrought, cast into the deep; within which, for a bait to bite at, there must 
be certain winckles and cockles, that will shut and open, and be ready to 
snap, such as we see those limpens be, called mituli. Halfe dead they 
should be first, that, being new put into the sea again, and desirous to 
revive and live, they might gape for water: and then the purples make at 
them with their pointed tongues, which they thrust out to annoy them ; 
but the other, feeling themselves pricked therewith, presently shut their , 
shels together, and bite hard. Thus the purples, for their greedinesse, are 
caught and taken up, hanging by their tongues." (Holland's Pirn,, i. 259.) 




410 Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

gasteropodes in question.* Having secured the shell, by 
applying to it the disk of the foot, they apply, to the point 
where they mean to penetrate, the apex of their proboscis, 
and now by a constant rubbing or grating of their filiform 
rough spinous tongue, assisted, perhaps, by some corrosive 
quality of the saliva, they succeed ultimately in perforating 
the shell. Surely the " patientia vincit " [patience over- 
comes] had never a more remarkable illustration ; for the 
J5uccina may work for days, and even weeks, before the life 
of the animal attacked is fully extinguished. 

But the proboscis {jig. 50.}, the organ by which this work 
is effected, demands a more detailed description ; for its me- 
chanism is scarcely less wonderful than 
the analogous organ of the elephant. It 
is cylindrical and of considerable length, 
and when not in use is kept retracted 
within the body, where it lies beyond the 
reach of injury. The better to under- 
stand its structure, we may represent it 
as being formed of two flexible cylinders, 
one within the other, and which are united 
at the upper margin, so that, in drawing out the interior cy- 
linder, we can only lengthen it at the expense of the other ; 
and, on pushing it back again, we, in shortening it, give cor- 
responding extension to the exterior, but the latter lengthens 
only on the upper side, because it is fixed to the parietes of 
the head by its inferior margin. Let us now add a number of 
longitudinal muscles, all of them very much divided at both 
extremities : the stripes of their internal or superior extremity 
are attached to the parietes of the body, those of the opposite 
end all along to the internal surface of the inner cylinder of 
the proboscis ; and their action, consequently, is to draw this 
cylinder and the whole proboscis inwards. When thus re- 
tracted, a great part of the internal surface of the interior 
cylinder makes part of the external surface of the exterior 
cylinder, and it is just the contrary when the proboscis is 
elongated and protruded. The protrusion of the inner cylinder 
by the unrolling of the exterior, or, which is the same thing, 
the evolution of the proboscis, is effected by its own peculiar 
annular muscles : these encircle it all its length, and, by con- 

* " The purple hath a tongue of a finger long, pointed in the end so 
sharpe, and hard withall, that it is able to bore an hole and pierce into 
other shell-fishes, and thereby shee feeds and gets her living." (Holland's 
P/m., i. 258.) The ancients were better informed on this subject than 
some modern writers, who have attributed these operations to the Trochus.

in regular succession, they force it out beyond the 
lips, in a manner perfectly similar to the evolution of the ten- 
tacula of the snail. There is, in particular, one muscle, near 
the place where the exterior muscle is attached to the head, 
which is stronger and more effective in this operation than all 
the others. When extended, the proboscis can be bent to 
all sides, and at any point, by the action of the retractor 
muscles, parcels of them acting, while others assume the place 
and office of antagonists. The Jigs. 51, 52, and 53. will serve 




to illustrate this interesting mechanism. In Jig, 51. the pro- 
boscis is retracted about a half: the external cylinder («) is 
seen enveloping a portion of the inner (h\ the end of which 
{c) is the end of the proboscis : the muscles which draw it 
within the body (d d) are in a state of contraction, and at e 
we see the great annular muscle, the use of which is to push 
forwards the inner cylinder, and consequently lengthen the 
organ. In Jig. 52. this muscle, and all the annular fibres, 
have by their action greatly protruded the proboscis, and 
its retractor muscles {d d) are extended and laid bare ; the 
exterior cylinder (a) has become very short, and the interior 
{b) is proportionably lengthened. Fig. 53. represents the 
two cylinders cut up in a longitudinal direction to show what 
they contain, and in what manner the retractor muscles are 
distributed upon the inner parietes. In the inner cylinder 
we find the tongue, with all its apparatus {e e)^ the salivary 



412 l^atural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

canals {ff\ and the greater portion of the gullet (gg) : 
the tongue is a very narrow cartilaginous membrane, armed 
with numerous acute spines or prickles curved backwards ; 
and the principal purpose of the elongation of the proboscis 
is seemingly to carry its rough point to the body which the 
snail wishes to perforate and suck. (Cuvier, Mem. sjir les 
Mollusq. M., xvii. 7.) 

This anatomy of the proboscis is derived from an exami- 
nation of the organ in Buccinum undatum, but it is appli- 
cable to all the pectinibranchial or proboscidian Carnivora. 
The other organs subservient to digestion in this tribe pre- 
sent nothing remarkable in their organisation. The stomach 
is a membranous bag, irregularly plaited on the inner surface ; 
the intestinal canal, like that of carnivorous animals in ge- 
neral, is short, and the lower portion, or the rectum, the 
inner coat of which is raised into several strong longitudinal 
folds, is wide, and opens on the right side of the branchial 
cavity under the margin of the collar. Cuvier observes that 
the sides of the rectum are thickened by a whitish substance, 
fatty, and a little granular, of which the use is unknown. 

It appears to be ascertained that the Bullae are also feeders 
on the Bivalved MoUusca. Mr. Humphreys mentions that 
be had found a species of Mya. alive in the gizzard of 
Bulla lignaria. (LtJi. Trans., ii. 16.) Cuvier says that the 
stomach of the Bullae, in general, is usually filled with the 
remains of small shells [Mem. sur les MoUus, M., x. 14.) ; 
and Mr. Sowerby tells us that they are " exceedingly vora- 
cious, as is evident from the fact, that the animal of B. aperta 
is sometimes distorted by having swallowed entire a Corbula 
nucleus, which is a very thick and strong shell, nearly equal 
in size to itself." {Ge?i. Rec. Foss, Shells, No. 39.) Now, as 
the Bullae have no perforating instrument in the mouth, nor 
jaws to crack them, they are under the necessity of swallow- 
ing their prey entire, and, as might have been anticipated, 
there is provided an internal apparatus to supply this defi- 
ciency, and break up the shells, so that the inmates may be 
exposed to the influence of the digestive agents. This singular 
apparatus is placed within the gizzard, and consists of three 
strong calcareous pieces, differing in form and size in the 
different species, thus modified, undoubtedly, to suit them to 
their peculiar wants, and moved by powerful muscles against 
each other.* In the Aplysia, a genus of the same natural

as a new genus of multivalve shells ; a genus retained by Retzius, Bruguiere, 
and Lamarck, until the mistake was detected by Draparnaud. (See Bosc, 
Vers., i. 76.) 



th^h' Food and Digestive Organs, 413 

order (Tectibranchia) as the Bulla, we find a curious modi- 
fication of this structure, accompanied, however, with a total 
discrepancy in the tastes and propensities of the creature ; 
and this is a fact which deserves to be remembered in esti- 
mating the value of inferences, in relation to the habits of 
animals, drawn from their presumed affinities. Tiie oral organs 
of Bulla and Aplysia are nearly the same, and there is a 
resemblance in their complicated digestive apparatus; but, in- 
stead of three shells, the muscular gizzard of the latter is 
studded with numerous sharp pyramidal knobs of a semi-car- 
tilaginous consistence, and of unequal sizes, and which may 
be rubbed off very easily, for they have no muscles to attach 
and move them. * When Bohadsch saw this structure for 
the first time, it seemed to him so anomalous and wonderful, 
that numerous dissections were required to convince him of 
its being the natural armature of the organ {De Anim. Mar., 
p. 19.) ; and he fell into the erroneous conclusion that it was 
fitted to triturate the shells on which the animal w^as presumed 
to prey. [De Anim, Mar., p. 22.) But the Aplysia is really 
herbivorous, as is asserted by Pessonel, Cuvier, and others ; 
and, were it necessary, I could add my testimony to this fact, 
having at one time kept a large specimen of Aplysia depilans 
for nearly three months in a state of confinement, during 
which it was fed on jPiici only, and these it ate greedily, show- 
ing some partiality to the dulse (i^i^cus palmatus). The food, 
previously to its reception in this curious gizzard, has passed 
through a large membranous crop, in which it probably un- 
dergoes little change : in the gizzard it is broken down, and 
in this state enters a third stomach, armed also on its internal 
surface with hook-like prickles directed forwards, and intended, 
doubtless, to tease the fibrous mass, that it may be more 
thoroughly subjected to the dissolving virtue of the gastric 
juices, and reduced to a homogeneous pulp, previously to its 
commixture with the bile, which flows into this viscus from 
two large orifices close to the pylorus, opening between two 
small membranous prominent crests. (Cuvier, Mem. sur les 
Mollusq, M., ix. 18.) 

* Pessonel's description of this organ is short, but characteristic: — 
" The membranes are thick, and are set with twelve stones, or horny 
pieces, of a bright yellow colour, and as transparent as fine yellow amber, 
ending in points like a diamond ; so that the great side, or basis, is set into 
the membrane of the gizzanl, as a diamond in its socket. Others differ in 
size, having different figures, that, in acting all together, they may be able 
to break and grind the /tcrds the animal feeds upon, as well by the strength 
of the muscle, or gizzard, which puts them into action, as by the situation 
of these stones, assisted by grains of sand found in it, turning the whole by 
this trituration into a liquor." (Phi/. Trans., vol. 50., 1758, p. 587.) 



414? Natural History of Molluscous Animals : — 

Among the other families of gasteropodes, I do not re- 
member any that are exclusively carnivorous, except the 
genus Testacellus, to outward appearance scarcely differing 
from the common slug, but distinguished by carrying a small 
shell above the tail, and a species of Vitrina, or shelled ter- 
restrial snail, found under stones in moist, shady, or grassy 
situations in the higher parts of the Island of Madeira. Un- 
like the slugs, the Testacellus burrows in the soil, and is the 
dread of the earthworm on which it feeds ; and these habits 
are accompanied with corresponding changes in its organis- 
ation. Its body is more cylindrical than that of the slug, and, 
in lieu of a shield confined to a limited portion of the neck, 
the whole body is encased with a thick coriaceous coat, to 
guard from the additional pressure to which it is exposed, 
and to afford sufficient strength to execute its furrows. But 
the most marked differences are found in the digestive organs. 
In the mouth there is no corneous denticulated jaw, nor a 
membranous spinigerous tongue ; but from between two ver- 
tical lips issues a very small cylindrical proboscis, and appro- 
priated to it a muscle which forms the most curious part in 
the structure of the creature. It is large, cylindrical, lies 
along the whole belly, and is attached to the left side of the 
back by a dozen of very distinct fleshy slips, almost perpen- 
dicular to the principal muscle of the body. (Cuvier, lib, cit, 
Mem, xii. 7.) The size and strength of this muscle indi- 
cate its paramount importance ; nor do all its actions seem to 
be ascertained, although one of its uses is certainly to retract 
the proboscis, and probably at the same time to grasp with 
firmness the struggling victims of its ferocity.* The carni- 

* Since this letter was written out for the press, a very interesting paper 
on the Testacellus has been published in this Magazine. (VII. 224.) From 
the observations of Mr. Denson, it is proved that the animal has the power 
of suddenly darting out its tongue to seize its prey : — " It is projected and 
applied in an instant ; and, when applied, the action of a muscular struc- 
ture, connected with its origin, draws it, and with it the worm, into the 
slug's mouth." (p. 227.) We now know the use of the remarkable muscle 
of Cuvier. — G. J. 

I have, in p. 226 — 230., shown, that, after I had made the remarks there 
published, 1 had found that equivalent and many additional ones had been 
published, long before, by M. de Ferussac and Mr. G. B. Sowerby. The 
following one, from Mr. G. B. Sowerby, I strove to present in p. 227., in 
connection with those there published ; but want of space excluded it ; — 

" We have observed them [individuals of T. scutulum] attentively, and 
were rather surprised that an animal generally so extremely sluggish in its 
motions, after discovering its prey by means of its tentacula, thrusting from 
its large mouth its white, crenulated, revolute tongue, should instantly 
seize upon, with extraordinary rapidity, and firmly retain, an earthworm of 
much greater size and apparent force than itself; but which, by its utmost 
exertion, is unable to escape." {G, B, Sowerby ^ in his Genera of Recent

vorous Vitrlna (Helicolimax Lamarck// of F^russac) differs 
from our native species in some respects ; but, according to the 
Rev. Mr. Lowe, to whom we owe our acquaintance with its 
habits, " is so closely alUed, that it would be very rash at 
present to separate it " from the genus.* When leaves and 
other vegetable matters were given to it, they were never 
touched, even although care was taken that the Vitrina should 
have nothing else for nearly a fortnight; but, on the very first 
night of its confinement, it would kill and eat a small snail, 
and it preyed on its own species greedily, the larger slaying 
the smaller, and then indulging its cannibal appetite. Two 
of nearly equal size being put together, the stronger or braver 
slew his neighbour, which furnished a plentiful repast for two 
or three succeeding nights, for it is during this season only 
that they feed. {Lowe, in ZooL Journ., iv. 342.) It would 
be well to ascertain whether our own Vitrinae are not equally 
carnivorous and addicted to cannibalism : they are at present 
believed to be herbivorous ; but Mr. Jeffreys informs us that 
V. pellucida " has the same carnivorous propensities as the 
smaller Zimacidae and Testacelli; and I once," he adds, 
" detected no less than seven individuals busily engaged in 
feeding on a scarcely dead earthworm, which was faintly 
writhing about, and endeavouring in vain to get rid of its 
assailants." {Lifin, Trans., xvi. 506.) 

The Pteropodous Mollusca are probably zoophagous ; the 
minute Crustacea and Medus<^, or particles of dead animal 
matter floating in the sea, furnishing their nutriment. Some 
species of this order abound amazingly in the Arctic Ocean, 
where the marine vegetation seems too scanty for the requisite 
supply of food; and, moreover, they are found floating far 
from the shore, and at the surface, where no vegetables are. 
We have, however, no certain information on this head. 

On the contrary, it is well ascertained that all the Cepha- 
lopoda are carnivorous, and for voraciousness and ferocity 
may justly claim precedence among molluscs. Such of them 
as swim in the bosom of the ocean, as ioligo, feed upon fish 



and Fossil Shells.) Mr. J. D. C. Sowerby has, too, shown me, in a spe- 
cimen preserved in spirits, that the tongue is furnished, around and just 
beneath (if not upon) its margin, on the outside, with short hair-like 
bristles, whicli doubtless increase its power of retaining secure hold. Mr. 
Sowerby also showed me, in other specimens, that the inner face of the 
stomach, or of the parts leading into it, is furrowed and roughened, in aid, 
it may be presumed, of the slug's ingesting its prey. — J. D. 

* This opinion of Mr. Lowe's is confirmed by the anatomy of the

in general, and they will frequently tear large pieces from 
those which have swallowed the baited hook, and deprive the 
fisherman of his gain. I have had more than one specimen 
of ioligo vulgaris brought me, which, adhering with a fatal 
tenacity to the fish, had allowed itself to be drawn from the 
water ; and in the stomachs of others I have found not only 
the undigested remains of this food, but the beaks of small 
individuals of their own species. The tribes, again (Octo- 
podeae and Miutili) (See Mr. Owen's beautiful and perfect 
Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus, p. 24.), whose habit is to crawl 
along the bottom, and seek concealment in rocky places, prey 
principally on the larger Crustacea, which find in their hard 
spiny shells, and their powerful claws, no protection against 
these voracious enemies. In the Mediterranean, the Octopi 
are held in detestation by the fishermen, because of the havoc 
they commit among the most esteemed species of lobsters and 
crabs, which is so extensive that scarcely any are to be found 
in their usual haunts during the summer season, and what 
have chanced to escape evince, by their mutilated condition, 
the peril they have run (Cuvier, lib, cit. Mem. i. 4.) Ac- 
cording to the early naturalists, the cuttle entraps its prey, 
partly, at least, by stratagem : " and albeit otherwise it be a 
very brutish and senselesse creature, so foolish withall, that it 
will swim and come to a man's hand ; yet it seems after a 
sort to be witty and wise, keeping of house and maintaining a 
familie : for all that they can take they carry home to their 
nest. When they have eaten the meat of the fishes, they 
throw the empty shels out of dores, and lie as it were in am- 
buscado behind, to watch and catch fishes that swimme 
thither." (Holland's Pliny, i. 250). Pliny also informs us, 
on the authority of Trebius Niger, that the Cephalopoda 
*' are most desirous and greedie of cockles, muscles, and such 
like shell fishes ;" and, in order to reach the animal scathless, 
they " lie in wait to spie when the said cockles, &c., gape wide 
open, and put in a little stone between the shels, but yet beside 
the flesh and bodie of the fish, for feare lest, if it touched and 
felt it, she would cast it forth again : thus they theeve, and 
without all danger, and in securitie get out the fleshie sub- 
stance of the meat to devoure it: the poor cockles draw their 
shels together for to clasp them between (as is above said), 
but all in vaine, for by reason of a wedge between, they will 
not meet close, nor come neere together. See how subtle 
and craftie in this point these creatures be, which otherwise 
are most sottish and senseless." (Holland's Pliny, i. 251.) 

The cuttlefish, I need scarcely remark, are all guiltless of 
this clever stratagem : their warfare, though cruel, is open, 




their Food and Digestive Organs. 4-17 

and they are amply furnished with the necessary weapons. 
The long flexible arms which encircle the head are set along 
their inner aspects, with numerous cup-like suckers, which 
the animal can fix to any object, and the adhesion is 
strengthened by a horny ring round the e(\ge of each sucker 
often pointed with sharp curved teeth. {Jig, 54. a.) " When 

an animal of this kind approaches 
any body with its suckers, in order 
to apply them more intimately, it 
presents them in a flat or plain state ; 
and when the suckers are thus fixed 
by the harmony of surfaces, the ani- 
mal contracts the sphincter, and 
forms a cavity in the centre, which 
becomes a vacuum. By this con- 
trivance, the sucker adheres to the 
surface with a force proportioned to 
its area, and the weight of the column 
of air and water, of which it con- 
"^tSVrfo^^^loTt/oVilugo stitutes the base. This force, mul- 
sagittata. tiplicd by the number of suckers, 

gives that by which all or a* part of the feet adhere to any 
body. This power of adhesion is such, that it is easier to 
tear off" the feet than to separate them from the substance to 
which the animal chooses to attach itself." (Cuvier, Comp, 
Anat., trans., i. 432.) It must, then, be a fearful thing, for 
any living creature, to come within their compass ; for, en- 
tangled in the slimy serpentine grasp of eight or ten arms, 
and held by the pressure of some hundreds of exhausted cups, 
escape is hopeless, and the struggles of the hapless victim, 
by bringing its body into more rapid contact with the suckers 
not yet applied, only accelerate its fate. 

The digestive system of this tribe is less uniform in struc- 
ture than, from the sameness of their food, we might at first 
suppose; but, in sketches of the very general character to which 
I limit myself, I pass over the peculiarities of tribes, to notice 
little beyond what is common to the class. The mouth, 
formed by a puckered fold of the skin, is placed at the base, 
and in the centre of the circle formed by the arms, and is 
armed with two powerful corneous jaws, having a vertical mo- 
tion : they are fashioned to the resemblance of a panot's bill 
{^g. 54. b), and are well adapted to tear their prey piece- 
meal, or crush the hard shell, especially when, as in the 
A^autili, their tips are hnrdened and calcareous. Between the 
jaws lies the tongue, adherent to the platform of the mouth,

but capable of being unrolled to a slight extent, and having 
its surface roughened with many rows of small sharply pointed 
tricuspidate, or semi-tricuspidate teeth, set in close and regular 
array, which can be erected at will, so as in some measure to 
grate down the food, previously to its transmission to the 
gizzard, and they greatly facilitate its descent by their direction, 
and by their motion backwards and forwards. In the mouth, 
the food is mixed with the saliva, which is secreted by one or 
two pairs of large glands. The gullet is a narrow membra- 
nous tube, of nearly uniform calibre throughout in the Xoligo

attachment swells out into a large membranous crop, of the 
appearance of which, in the Octopus ventricosus, at least, I 
cannot give you a better idea than by comparing it, both in 
size and position, to the bulb of a small retort. The gizzard 
{,fig' 55i 56. b) is a thick muscular organ, like the gizzard of 
a fowl, and strongly corrugated internally in a longitudinal 
direction: immediately beyond it, in the 6epia and Octopodiae, 
is situated a curious spiral appendage, laminated on the inte- 
rior, into which the bile is poured ; but in the jLoligo, instead 
of this spiral caecum *, and, as it were, to compensate for its 
deficiency of a crop, there is a very large membranous and 
somewhat cylindrical bag {Jig^ 55, 56, c), on the posterior and 
upper part of which we trace vestiges of the spiral struc- 
ture, for there a fatty substance is so disposed as to assume 
that form, having the outer edges cut in a deeply serrated 
manner (^y%. 55, 56, d), I have found this bag always filled 
with a grumous fluid, and it is undoubtedly the organ in which 
digestion is principally effected and completed ; for it not only 
receives the bile, but is itself, or the spiral part of it, supposed 
to furnish a secretion analogous to that of the pancreas in 
higher animals. The aperture between the gizzard and this 
caecum is oblique and valvular, and another adjoining aperture 
leads to the intestine {Jig, 55, 56. f e), which, like the oeso- 
phagus^ winds upwards along the surface of the liver to ter- 
minate in the funnel, which is the conmion vent of all the 
excrements. The liver is very large in all the genera of this 
class, and must furnish a copious supply; but, besides this, and 
the secretions of the other accessary organs to good digestion, 
Sir E. Home believes that the inky fluid is intended also to 
have some effect upon the lower portion of the intestinal canal, 
to enable this to extract from its contents " a secondary kind 
of nourishment" {Camp, Anat., i. 369. and 393.); an opinion 
not very probable in itself, and with but a few fanciful analo- 
gies in its support. 

* " It may with greater propriety be denominated the duodejunn, as it 
performs some of the offices of that part of the gut in the higher orders of 
animals. This stomach is conical, closed at the distal extremity, and per- 
forms about a turn and a half, like a spiral shell. Its inner surface is 
covered with a ridge, which traverses it in a closely spiral direction." — 
Fleming, Phil. Zool., ii, 424. 

f In reference to these figures, it may be observed that ihey are copied 
from nature; a remark which seems necessary, since they differ entirely from 
Sir E. Home's figure of the stomach of Loligo vulgaris, or the iSepia Lo- 
ligo of Linnaeus. Sir Everard's figure appears to have been taken from 
a species of Octopus. 



420 Observations on some British S^pulce. 

Art. IV. Observations on some British Serpulce. 
By the Rev. M. J. Berkeley. 

In an interesting notice of Serpula tubularia Mont., by 
Dr. Johnston, in p. 126., a doubt is expressed whether 
S. tubularia Mont, and S. wrmicularis of Authors have not 
been confounded in an article in the Zoological Journal, iii. 
229. The truth is, that, at the time the article in question 
w^as prepared, my text-book for British conchology was Dr. 
Turton's Conchological Dictlonari/, as being the most recently 
published work upon the subject ; and, throughout, where 
S. tubularia is mentioned, the species so named in that work 
is intended, which is not the same with S. tubularia Mont,, 
but is S. triquetra Mont. Test. Brit., pt. 2. p. 511. (Tubus 
t;ermicularis Ellis, Corall. t. 38. f. 2.), but not Mont. SuppL 
p. 157.5 which is the true S. triquetra. Though I was well 
acquainted with the several allied species and their distinctive 
characters, I confess freely that I was not then aware of the 
identity of Montagu's S. tubularia, with S. arundo Tnrt., and, 
in consequence, supposing Turton's species to have been 
first described by him, adopted his name. 

The following synonymes, which I find written on the back 
of the rough copy of the article above mentioned, I shall beg 
leave to subjoin, as they may possibly be useful to others in 
the study of the common British species, whose nomenclature 
has been most unfortunately confused, though, at the time 
the Supplement to the Testacea Britannica was published, the 
species were well known to Montagu. The only alteration I 
shall make is the one suggested by Dr. Johnston, of the pro- 
priety of which there can be no doubt ; viz., that the older 
name of Montagu should be preferred to the more recent 
one of Turton. I am quite satisfied, on a careful examination 
of Turton's descriptions, that he had in view the species 
figured in Ellis, quoted above, for his S. tubularia, and the 
S. tubularia Mont, for his S. arundo. If not, the very com- 
mon species of Ellis is altogether omitted ; or, if S. t;ermicu- 
laris of the Conchological Dictionary be supposed identical 
with it, the almost equally common species with a double 
infundibuliform operculum, figured by Mliller, Zool. Dan., 
t. 86. f. 7 — 9. I shall only add to these observations, that 
S. tubularia Mont, ought certainly to be placed in a different 
genus from S. t;ermicularis, &c., being altogether destitute 
of an operculum. According to the principles of Cuvier's 
Regne Animal, it belongs to the genus Sabella, and is one of 
the rare instances in which a shelly tube occurs in that genus. 



Observations on some British Serpul(je, 421 

This has been proposed in a paper printed in No. xx. of the 

Zoological Journal^ but not yet published. 

The following are the synonymes alluded to above : —

I am obliged to designate this species, which is characterised 
by the double infundibuliform operculum, by a new name, as, 
in the confusion of synonymes, 1 know not that there is any 
which can be unobjectionably applied to it. The name now 
proposed will have the advantage of calling attention to the 
figure of the animal in Zoologia Danica^ and thereby prevent 
any confusion which might arise from the similarity of its 
shell to that of any other species. I have received from the 
Western Hebrides a species exactly resembling this as regards 
the testaceous covering, but furnished with two double infun- 
dibuliform opercula. Though the animal was preserved in 
spirits, it was so decayed that, unfortunately, I could not trace 
the connection of the opercula with the branchial fringe, and, 
therefore, do not venture to propose it as decidedly distinct.

This is perhaps the most common of all the British Ser- 
pulae. The operculum, which is testaceous, is very variable. 
Specimens occur in which the testaceous coating is a mere 
pellicle : but in this case there is no difficulty in distinguish- 
ing it from the foregoing species, as it is destitute of the beau- 
tiful radiating striae. Other forms of the operculum are de- 
scribed by Montagu, in the place quoted above, and figured

422 Foliage of Sallows and Osiers destroyed 

Art. V. On the Injury produced to Plantations of Sallotvs a?id 
Osiers (Salices), and Loss of Gain to the Proprietor, hy the 
Ravages, on the Foliage of these PlantSy of the Caterpillars of 
the Insect Nematus caprece F. : 'voith a Notice, in Sequel, of the 
n)ery great Lriportance of a Scientific Knotvledge of Natural 
Objects to those engaged in the Practices of Rural Economy. 

I OBSERVE, in p. 265., a short notice of Nematus caprese. 
I am very little, indeed, of a naturalist; but, having suffered 
from the ravages of this insect, my attention has been drawn 
to its acts and habits ; and the results of my experience may be, 
perhaps, useful to others. I have a piece of moist ground, in 
a low sheltered situation, highly favourable in itself for the 
growth of osiers. I remember it, as first known to me about 
thirty years ago, when some straggling osier bushes were 
growing upon it, and it was covered in other parts with weeds 
and brambles. On the offer of an opportunity, about twenty 
years since, I determined on cultivating the spot well, and 
then planting it with osier plants. A sort of tradition pre- 
vailed, that osiers would never succeed there. This I disre- 
garded, deeming it absurd, since they grew freely in very 
inferior situations in the neighbourhood. The ground was 
thoroughly dug and then planted. After a few years, the 
osiers had disappeared, we hardly knew how. The spot was 
again planted, and with a like result. The ravages of the 
insect were now noticed, indeed, but still they did not suf- 
ficiently attract our attention ; and osier plants were actually 
put in a third time. My attention being now strongly drawn 
to the subject, I discovered that which ought to have been 
perceived half a century sooner, namely, that Nematus ca- 
preae, favoured by the peculiar localities, was the cause of 
all this devastation. The spot is low, moist, shut in by wood, 
and very near the southern limit of England. The species 
of willow planted was chiefly one of those with broad leaves, 
woolly underneath.* The warmth of the situation, and the 
nidus for eggs afforded by these woolly leaves, were, I pre- 
sume, the combined cause of the insect being so remarkably 
attracted to this spot. Some of the plants were of a species 
with smooth narrow leaves f: these escaped much longer 

* [Most probably the 5alix caprea L. " The name caprea seems to 
have originated in the reputed fondness of goats for the catkins." — Smith. 
The specific epithet of the insect, Nematus capreae F., was doubtless in- 
tended to teach the fact, that the foliage of *S'alix caprea Z/., and, it may be 
assumed, that of allied species, as well (all called sallows in some parts of 
England), is the favourite food of this insect in the larva state.] 

f [*S'alix triandra, «mygdalina, Vovhydna^ rubra, purpurea, i/elix, and 
Lambertia««, are species of osier, natives of Britain : of this kind, the first 
four include the species more extensively cultivated in English osier plant- 
ations, called, in some places, holts.]

than the others, but still they did not escape eventually : 
they were also attacked by another caterpillar. 

I introduced both red and black ants, and also put some of 
the caterpillars into their nests ; but the ants disregarded them 
altogether. Having, although thus slowly, ascertained the 
true state of things, the ground was once more cultivated, and 
was planted with apple trees. As there happens to be no 
insect there which much attacks these, they thrive very well. 
The distance at which apple trees are planted is also less 
favourable to the propagation of vermin. 

I have communicated all this detail, in order to show the 
importance, to individuals, of attending to such seemingly 
trifling matters. Many a plantation, &c., fails in an appa- 
rently inexplicable manner. A scientific investigation would, 
in numerous cases, disclose the truth, and prevent farther loss. 
Had a person acquainted with entomology been proprietor of 
this osier ground fifty years since, he would speedily have 
discovered the truth, and might have saved 200/. or more to 
himself and his successors. 

Wireworms. — I take this opportunity of mentioning the 
wireworm. This neighbourhood has been repeatedly ravaged 
by it. Crops of wheat and potatoes have suffered severely, 
but the pastures have never been touched. We have no old 
meadow, and our lands are always broken up when three or 
four years old. The beetle and its habits are not sufficiendy 
known. If some popular knowledge on these destructive in- 
sects could be conveyed to farmers and labourers, they might, 
perhaps, be destroyed on a large scale. 

Penzance, June 18. 1834. 



The facts communicated by C. D. on the habits of the 
Nematus capreje are a welcome furtherance of our knowledge 
of the natural history of that insect; and they, in conjunction 
with C. D.'s remarks, are, we conceive, of emphatic value, as 
exemplifying to entomologists how much their aid in eluci- 
dating popularly the forms, structure, transformations, habits, 
and names of insects is wanted by persons engaged in the 
businesses of rural life, and also as intimating to them some 
idea of the extent to, and mode in, which the required aid 
should be rendered. A remembrance of the nature of our 
own wants in things entomological, as experienced while en- 
gaged in rural practices, and, added to this, some knowledge 
of the wants of others so engaged, tempt us, therefore, to 
join C. D. in soliciting entomologists (wliich C. D. does, in 
effect) to do, forlliwith, what they can, towards leading us, as

farmers, gardeners, orcbardists, foresters, intendants of cattle, 
&c., to the knowledge we so much desire, and so certain to 
avail us greatly, not only in a pecuniary relation (perhaps, the 
least worthy regard of all the relations), but in the excellent 
and best one of intellectual exercise, or mental gratification. 

The means by, and the mode in, which this could best be 
done, is, we have thought, the production of a work which 
should supply such information on the species of insects emi- 
nently injurious, and those eminently beneficial, to rural in- 
terests, as is supplied on the plants to which these qualities 
appertain, in Martyn's Flora Rustica (in which the species of 
plants described and treated of are identified by figures), and 
in Holditch's Essay on the Weeds of Agriculture, It may be 
urged, that very much of the suggested information, and well- 
nigh all that entomologists possess, has been already placed 
on record by them, for the public benefit. This may be true ; 
but it is also true that the places of record are too various, and 
the access to the whole of them a matter too consumptive of 
time and money, for many rural practitioners to indulge in. 
It is needless to remark, that every technicality which could 
be spared, should be kept out of such a work ; and the more 
nearly it could be written in the phraseology of ordinary life, 
it would be, we think, so much the better. Should woodcuts 
be deemed sufficient (to spare coloured figures) for the pur- 
pose of identifying each species, they would be much to be 
preferred, as being introducible amongst the text, and thus to 
be viewed at once without the distraction of a distant reference. 
In the descriptive matter, it would be well to indicate what 
facts require to be confirmed by additional testimony, and 
what points in the economy of each insect remain yet to be 
explored ; and thus the practical man, in appropriating the 
researches of the entomologist, might be induced to return the 
result of his own, and might, while he appropriated the fruit 
of the researches of the entomologist, be instigated to institute 
others for himself, and to contribute the result of them to the 
general store. The publication of Notes on such a work 
would, it is possible, be scarcely less common than Notes on 
White's Selborne; and, out of each of them, something of truth 
and means of completeness would surely be acquirable. 
Neither can it be fallacious or ungratifying to presume that 
such a work would tend very much indeed to the extension 
of the studying of insects in an entomological manner. Every 
accurately represented and described species would make 
known one of a certain type of form and structure, and lead 
the way to assimilation and association. Under the descrip- 
tion of each of the species, something of the leading points of 
affinity might perhaps be guardedly hinted. — J, Z>. 



On Remedies against Insect Ravages. ^^25 

Art. VI. On the most advisable Methods for discovering Remedies 
against the Ravages of Insects ; and a Notice of the Habits of 
the Onion Fly. By J. O. Westwood, Esq. F.L.S. &c. Read 
before the Entomological Society, May 5. 1834. 

One of the most common, and at the same time most 
weighty, charges brought against the entomologist is, that, 
whilst he bestows endless labour and trouble on collecting 
and preserving various kinds of insects, his attention is never, 
or but very seldom indeed, directed to enquiries into the most 
effectual lemedies for those insect scourges which nature has 
inflicted upon our vegetable productions. He is told, over 
and over again, that, to make the science which he cultivates 
more beneficial to society, and thereby more generally known, 
a share of his attention must be occupied in prosecuting 
experiments for the purpose of discovering how this or that 
insect enemy may be combated in the most successful manner. 
And, indeed, it must be admitted, that this is a charge too well 
founded ; although, perhaps, a few observations may convince 
those who are the most ready to bring it forward at every 
opportunity, that it may be very greatly palliated. 

In the first place, therefore, it may be urged, that these 
destructive insects, appearing, as they do, in occasional seasons, 
in vast profusion, are produced in such myriads, for some 
wise purpose, which we may not be permitted to understand. 
They, like the locusts, of which so splendid a poetical de- 
scription is recorded in the second chapter of the prophet 
Joel, form portion of the army of the Almighty, wherewith 
he scourges the nations ; and, although the scientific researches 
of mankind might discover means of destroying in some de- 
gree their hosts, it may, perhaps, not unreasonably be supposed 
either that he would not be allowed to frustrate the designs of 
Providence, or that, if this evil were removed, others, perhaps 
more weighty, might arise in their stead.* 

* [Man, it is true, fails occasionally to secure to himself all the fruits of 
his own sowing ; but, nevertheless, 

" His portion in the good that Heaven bestows " 
is undeniably a munificent one. In relief of his [)artial losses, no sentiment 
is perhaps more healthy and more just than the unflattering one of our 
great moral poet. Pope : — 

" Has God, thou fool, work'd solely for thy good, 
Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food "? 
Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn. 
For him as kindly spreads the flow'ry lawn. 
Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings ? 
Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings. 
Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat ? 
Loves of his own and ra[)tures swell the note. 



426 On the Discovery of Remedies 

In the second place, the minuteness of the size of these 
creatures presents an almost insurmountable barrier against 
those delicate enquiries and observations on every stage of 
their existence, by which alone we can arrive at a knowledge 
of the real nature and cause of the mischief, and be thereby, 
and thereby alone, enabled to judge of a suitable remedy. 

In the third place, the want of sufficient opportunity is not 
the least objection which may be brought against the charge. 
It has always appeared to me, that no effectual check can be 
given to the ravages of any insect, until its entire habits and 
economy have been ascertained. Thus far, in the enquiry, is 
the strict province of the entomologist, whose attention ought, 
as it seems to me, to be directed, from day to day, and from 
year to year, not to isolated spots of ground, but to whole 
acres, more especially with reference to the peculiarities of 
seasons, and to atmospheric changes : but here we have only 
gone half way. It now becomes the province of the agricul- 
turist to discover a remedy ; since it seems equally clear that 
this ulterior branch of the enquiry can be prosecuted eiFectu- 
ally only by persons perfecdy conversant with the chemical 
nature of soils, the action of various ingredients which may 
be employed as remedies not only upon the insects themselves, 
but upon the plants which may be attacked. Such persons, 
too, are alone able to judge of the practicability of the applica- 
tion of the proposed remedies : since it is surely needless for 
an indoor entomologist to endeavour by experiment to dis- 
cover remedies which, when discovered, cannot be adopted, 
either from the great expense of the article itself, or the im- 
possibility of applying it ; or the liability of the destruction, 
not only of the insect, but also of the plant itself; and even 
instances of the latter description have come under my own 
notice. 

Hence It appears that the most efficient remedies will in all 
probability be suggested by those persons who, residing in 
the country, can obtain a knowledge of the economy of these

tical modes of examination, and who unite the entomological 
knowledge requisite to trace most effectually their habits, with 
a perfect and scientific knowledge of the true principles of 
agriculture. 

Thus, it seems undoubted, that this want of sufficient op- 
portunity for investigation has hitherto proved one of the 
greatest barriers to our proposing satisfactory remedies against 
the ravages of insects ; and knowing, as we too well know, 
that the study and investigation of these objects have hitherto 
been almost totally uncultivated, it is not perhaps to be won- 
dered at, that so little has been done. The observer of insects 
has proposed remedies which the agriculturist cannot adopt ; 
and the agriculturist, on the other hand, ignorant of the nature 
of insects, has pursued the very plan which has been the most 
congenial to the habits of the insects which he wished to de- 
stroy : as in the case of the French gardener, recorded by 
Reaumur, who, thinking to destroy the caterpillars of the 
cabbage moth, buried them just at the time when they were 
themselves on the point of going into the earth to change to 
chrysalides. 

The study of insects is, however, beginning at length to 
emerge from that contempt with which it has been so long 
regarded ; and I trust that the labours of the members of the 
Entomological Society will show that practical utility has not 
been lost sight of in their discussions. 

It is owing to this more extended observation of insects, 
that we now find gentlemen, possessing great agricultural 
knowledge, applying themselves to the investigation of noxious 
insects ; and no one appears to have entered more fully into 
this united species of enquiry, or to have obtained more de- 
cided success, than the gentleman whose communications, in 
various works [especially in the Ejitomological Magazhie, 
vol. i.], are published with the name of Rusticus of Godal- 
ming; although, perhaps, there is a shade too little of the 
entomologist in his writings. 

In one of the papers of this gentleman, published in the 
Entomological Magazitie [i. 363 — 367.]? upon the turnip fly, 
an apparently successful remedy has been proposed against 
its attacks, by steeping the seeds, upon which it is supposed 
that the eggs of the insect have been deposited, in brine. 

The object of the present communication is to suggest the 
application of a similar remedy for the prevention of the 
ravages of a scarcely less destructive insect, the onion fly. 

On examining a bed of onions in the month of May, almost 
as soon as the plants are out of the ground, some of them will 
occasionally be observed to be in a drooping state ; these soon 



428 Habits of the Onion Fly, 

die, and others of a larger size are then observed to decay 
in a similar manner : and this continues until the middle of 
July, and even until the onions are full grown, at which time 
they have occasionally sufficient strength to survive the injury, 
with the decay of a portion only of the outer layer or coat : the 
centre part remaining sound. In this manner whole beds are 
destroyed ; and it seems to be of little use to sow again, as the 
fresh-sown plants do not fare better. In light soils, especially, 
the attacks of this insect are occasionally very annoying to the 
gardener. 

On stripping off the coats of the young onions, which show 
evident signs of decay, it is at once perceived that it is owing 
to the attack of a small apod [legless] grub upon the vital 
parts of the young bulb or stem of the plant, that its destruc- 
tion has been occasioned. On pulling up a very young onion, 
its interior is found to be completely devoured by a single 
grub at its very heart, but in plants of larger growth I have 
counted at least half a dozen of these grubs, varying con- 
siderably in size. They are of a moderately long cylindrical 
form, pointed at one end, which is the head, and this is fur- 
nished with two minute tentacula ; the other end is the broader, 
and is obliquely truncated, with the edges rugose, and with 
two small reddish spots, from which appear to proceed two 
internal and dark-coloured veins : the body is smooth and 
shining, and of a whitish colour. When full grown, they 
much resemble the common maggots of the flesh-fly, and are 
nearly half an inch in length. In the summer season they 
are about a fortnight in arriving at their full growth. They 
generally consume the entire of the interior of the onion, the 
outside skin of which is alone left dry and entire, serving as 
a place in which they undergo their transformations, without 
forming any cocoon, or without shedding their outer skin ; the 
skin of the larva, in fact, shortening gradually, and assuming 
an oblong oval form, rather truncate at the posterior extremity, 
within which the real pupa is to be found. This puparium, 
as it may be termed, is of a chestnut colour, having its pos- 
terior end blackish, with the extremity red, and two large 
black spots observed in the larva : the oral tentacula are also 
observable at the other end, they being somewhat exserted. 

In about another fortnight the perfect fly makes its appear- 
ance. It is a dipterous insect, belonging to the family Mns- 
cidae, and genus Anthomyia ; and appears to have been noticed 
by Linnaeus under the name of Musca radlcum ; it is the 
Scatophaga ceparum of Kirby and Spence *, which is referred

by Stephens to the Anthomyia radicum of Meigen and Wiede- 
mann. Although I regret that want of time, as well as igno- 
rance of the more scientific principles of agriculture, have 
prevented my making the extensive series of observations by 
which, as above insisted upon, a knowledge of the entire natural 
history of, and consequently of the most efficient remedies 
against, this insect can be obtained, yet I may be allowed 
space for a few suggestions resulting from the facts already 
acquired. 

If, from the somewhat similar growth of the turnip and 
onion, we consider that the grubs which attack the latter plant 
in a very young state are produced from eggs deposited (in 
the same manner as Rusticus states to be the case with those 
of the turnip fly) upon the seeds of the onion, then it is evi- 
dent that, if immersion in brine had the effect of destroying 
the turnip fly's eggs, the same effect will be produced with 
those of the onion fly. 

If, on the other hand, such should not be the case, and the 
eggs should be deposited by the parent fly upon the young 
plants, or even if, from what is known of the repeated gene- 
rations of the domestic fly in the course of the season, the 
first grub should be produced from eggs deposited upon the 
seed, and the latter generation of grubs from eggs deposited 
upon the growing plants by the flies produced from such early 
grubs, then, and in either of such cases, it appears to me 
that an effectual remedy will be to destroy the early grubs, 
to as great an extent as possible, by carefully selecting and 
burning (not burying) the young infested onions. 

The safest way, however, will be to employ both remedies, 
at least until it shall be ascertained whether the eggs be actu- 
ally deposited upon the seed or not. I make this remark, 
because, as has been suggested to me by a naturalist of emi- 
nence, the pods of the onion are closely shut, not being suffered 
by the seedsmen to split before they are gathered * ; more- 
Cinereous, clothed with distant black hairs, proceeding, particularly in the 
thorax, from a black point : legs nigrescent, back of abdomen of ^ with 
an interrupted black vitta down the middle; wings immaculate; poisers 
and alulae pale yellow ; length 3^ lines. 

* The same objection exists against the idea that the eggs of the turnip 
fly are placed upon the turnip seed. Moreover, there are some other cir- 
cumstances connected with the natural history of this insect, which call for 
minute investigation. Thus, it is contrary to analogy to supj)osc that the 
egg of an insect, the grub of which, when hatched, nuist feed above ground, 
should be placed by the parent fly in such a situation that it would neces- 
sarily be buried. Again, if the turnip fly be produced, as Rusticus pre- 
sumes, from eggs laid upon the seeds, how did it happen that " there were 
some beetles li'om the very first coming uj) of the plant ';• " since there 
would be no necessity for their living through the winter, like some butter-

over, unless we suppose either that the grubs of the fly are 
liable to a very great difference in their period of develope- 
ment, whilst in their unhatched state in the ^g'g^ or that all 
the grubs are produced from eggs deposited by the different 
generations of the fly upon the plants themselves, we can- 
not account for the constant succession of grubs, or for the 
very great difference in their size in a single bulb. Again, 
it seems contrary to our ideas of the proceedings of animals, 
that a fly should at one period of the year have the instinct 
to deposit the eggs upon the ripe seed, whilst its descendants 
should place their eggs at the root of the growing plants ; 
and yet, if this be not the case, in what state does the fly re- 
main through the winter? Again there appears a difficulty 
how the grubs find their way to the centre of a root under 
ground, if produced from eggs not placed upon the seed, but 

flies, to deposit their eggs in spring. Again, if the eggs were deposited 
upon the seed, how did it happen that the grubs " were very various in 
size ? " Again, as there is but one generation of herbivorous beetles in 
the course of a year, if the eggs of the turnip fly were deposited upon the 
seed in the autumn, there would be no perfect beetles until the grubs to be 
hatched from these eggs, in the next summer, had arrived at this state ; and 
yet Rusticus observes, " I knew from experience that the turnip beetle 
fed on wild mustard and several other hedge plants ; and, therefore, it was 
not at all an improbable thing that, when they smelt the fragrance of the 
fresh-bursting cotyledons of their favourite food " (at which period he had 
just stated that the grubs were most abundant), " they should skip down 
from their spring habitations, the hedges, and commence the attack." 

From these remarks I think it will be evident that minute research is 
as necessary into the economy of the turnip fly, as of that which infests 
the onions ; and it is under such circumstances that the turnip fly has 
been selected by the Entomological Society [see p. 3. of the cover of 
Mag. Nat. Hist, for July] as the subject of the prize Essays upon noxious 
insects for the present year. 

[" Turnip-seed, committed to properly prepared ground, makes its ap- 
pearance on the fourth day. Now, suppose that the eggs of the insects 
are attached to the seed, as is represented by Rusticus, is it probable that 
they can be transformed first into grubs, next into chrysalides, and lastly 
into perfect beetles, in the short space of five, or six, or even fourteen 
days ? This is for Rusticus to explain ; and it is to be hoped that his de- 
scription only is erroneous, not his doctrine." This remark is quoted from 
the British Farmer's Magazine for November, 1833, where an abstract of 
Rusticus's discovery, and remarks upon it, are presented. In the abstract, 
Rusticus's statement of the effects of steeping the seeds of turnip in brine 
is, from misapprehension, misrepresented, but has been corrected in a sub- 
sequent Number of the same Magazine, by the 'author of the abstract and 
remarks. In the Gardener'*s Magazine, ix. 505., x. 78., some facts in 
relation to the habits of the turnip beetle are registered; but the work 
most likely, it would seem, by its title, to avail the researcher on the habits 
of this insect, is one about to be published, entitled, " Report of the Don- 
caster Agricultural Society on the turnip fly, founded on the returns re- 
ceived from upwards of a hundred gentlemen, cultivating turnips on every 
variety of soil in the country."

deposited by the fly above ground : it may be said, indeed, 
that the ovipositor of the parent fly is constructed in a manner 
capable of great elongation, so as to enable it to protrude its 
eggs to a distance beneath the ground, and to fix them there 
upon the outside, or even beneath the outer coats of the bulb. 

These, however, are all points of natural history, which a 
minute series of observations can alone determine : and my 
chief object, in thus noticing them, is in the hope that some 
experienced agriculturist will take up the enquiry. It is this 
class of the community who are the greatest sufferers from 
this and similar evils ; it is not too much to hope that they 
will consider the subject worthy of investigation.*

The Cause of Volcanic Activity, — There are few persons

* [In the Gardener^s Magazmey vii. 90 — 92., there are brief notices of 
papers which had been reported on at the eighty-ninth meeting of the Royal 
Prussian Horticultural Society. From one notice I quote that " Herr 
Borggreve also confirms, by experience, the good effect of sprinkling pul- 
verised charcoal over beds destined for onion seed. The mixing of char- 
coal powder with the superficial mould, to protect bulbous roots against 
the larvae of a fly (Anthomjia ceparum) has already been recommended 
in the Transactions of the Society.*' These Transactions are entitled Ver- 
handlungen dcs Vereins zur Beforderung des Gartenbaues in den Koniglich 
Prcussischen Staaten^ of which the first part of the tenth volume is pub- 
lished : they are in quai'to, and some insects troublesome in gardens are 
figured and described in them. Growing plants of the cultivated onion 
are occasionally eaten by other species of insects. In a bed of about 7 ft. 
long, by 3| ft. broad, sown with onion seed in 1833, so late as early in May, 
a plentiful crop of onion plants arose ; of the first number of which scarcely 
more than half remained on September 12., the absent plants having been 
successively eaten off at, and just below, the surface of the soil, by larvae 
of some species of iVoctuadae, resident in the soil. Of these larvae, 1 found 
within the area of the bed, on September 14., on digging up then the 
remainder of the onions, forty-seven, most of them full grown, but some 
of them not so. The late sowing of the seeds from which the onion plants 
had arisen had occasioned them to be in a growing or vernal state, that is, 
without bulbs and maturity, through much of the period named, and thus 
had, perhaps, preserved them as eligible food for the iVoctuada?, when 
earlier-sown, forwarder, and riper onions would not have been. The 
bulbs of those left till the last were very small.]

another, except that some of them better account for the 
phenomena which have been observed than others. This state 
of uncertainty has given every student Hberty to form a theory 
for himself, or to modify that which pleased him best. The 
pages of our scientific journals and works on volcanoes abound, 
therefore, in explanations of volcanic action; and we might 
almost have been excused if we had passed over the subject. 
But, as there is no probability of ascertaining truth while the 
mind is cherishing error, there will be some advantage in 
exposing false opinions, and in breaking the fetters which 
prevent the intellect from healthy and vigorous activity. We 
shall therefore enumerate some of the most remarkable 
theories which have at various times engaged the attention of 
the learned, and state some of our objections to those which 
may appear the most plausible. 

There is reason to believe that much of ancient fable de- 
rived its origin from an erroneous estimate of natural pheno- 
mena. The history of astronomy affords abundant proof of 
this statement ; and we believe that, in every country where 
the inhabitants have been accustomed to the sight of volcanic 
phenomena, they have ascribed them to occult deified agency. 

The Egyptians attributed all physical evil to the demon 
Typhon ; and the Greeks, who adopted the superstitions 
and science of the Egyptians, have evidently symbolised the 
volcanic phenomena in their description of this personage. 
Typhon, they tell us, was a giant more powerful than all the 
children of the earth ; his head reached to the stars, and his 
arms embraced the rising and the setting sun ; with his hands 
he hurled the rocks to the highest heavens ; fire gleamed from 
his eyes, and liquid fire boiled in his mouth. He is said to 
have been born in Cilicia, which is known to be a volcanic 
district ; and having, shortly after his birth, frightened the gods 
from heaven, he was pursued by Jupiter to the borders of 
the Lake Serbonis, another volcanic district, and was at last 
imprisoned in the Island of Sicily, where he still continues to 
rave, shaking the earth with his groans and ejecting liquid fire. 

The philosophical opinion, if such we may call it, of the 
ancient Greeks and Romans, as standing in opposition to the 
fable by which the uninitiated were imposed upon, is stated 
by the Roman poet Lucretius, in his De Rerum Natura, 
Volcanoes were supposed to derive their origin from the con- 
version of the confined air in the cavities of the earth into 
violent winds by heat. By this process, it was said, caloric 
was generated, and the combustible bodies in the bowels of 
the earth were inflamed. 

This is certainly the meanest theory of volcanic action that 



Volcanoes, 433 

has ever been proposed, it is nothing more philosophical than 
the fable we have mentioned, and far less poetical : but it is 
not surprising that such a theory as this should have obtained, 
currency among the ancients, for they were almost entirely 
ignorant of all those facts upon which an explanation of the 
phenomena of nature must be founded ; and the same reason 
which is an apology for the ignorance of the moderns upon 
the cause of volcanoes applies equally to the ancients. The 
phenomena which accompany eruption prevent a direct exa- 
mination of its cause; and, consequently, opinions must be 
formed from the circumstances under which the effect is pro- 
duced, the extent of the volcanic action, and the character 
of the ejected mass. With all these the ancients were un- 
acquainted; but our knowledge is much inferior to our 
opportunities. 

Werner was among the first of the geologists who ventured 
to propose a theory of volcanic action. He attributes erup- 
tion to the ignition of coal and other inflammable substances ; 
and, in support of this hypothesis, Pallas informs us that 
the ejection of mud by the volcanoes near the Cimmerian 
Bosphorus was occasioned by the combustion of the coal 
measures. 

Brieslak proposed to improve this theory by attributing 
volcanic phenomena to the ignition of petroleum by sulphuric 
and phosphoric acids, and, in support of his theory, adduces 
the presence of these substances in lava. 

As it would be difficult to find, in the present day, an 
advocate for either of these theories, we shall not stop to 
disprove them. 

A much more singular theory, and one which has a much 
greater appearance of probability, was proposed by Sir Hum- 
phry Davy. After the discovery of the metallic bases of the 
earths and alkalies, he was induced to imagine that the earth 
itself might, perhaps, have been originally a globe of metallic 
alloy. Now, if this had been the primitive condition of the 
world, the combination of the oxygen of the atmosphere with 
the metals would, he says, have formed a crust of earthy 
matter, as a superficial covering, the interior still remaining 
a deoxidised metallic mass. Now, if water should, by pe- 
netrating through the crust, reach this metallic mass, a che- 
mical action would be immediately produced. The oxygen 
of the water, having a great affinity for the metal, would be 
liberated from the hydrogen, and a metallic oxide would be 
formed. This chemical action would cause the disengage- 
ment of caloric, sufficient to melt the surrounding rocks, 
while the disengaged hydrogen gas would, exerting its influ-

ence as a confined elastic fluid, rend the rocks, and burst into 
a flame upon exposure to the atmosphere. There is certainly 
a great degree of plausibility about this hypothesis, and it is 
not altogether unphilosophical ; but Davy was, from some 
cause, induced to renounce it, and give preference to an ex- 
planation founded on the doctrine of central heat. Dr. 
Daubeny, who has adopted Davy's discarded child, suggests 
that it is not inconsistent with what we know of Davy's cha- 
racter to suppose that he acquired a distaste for the theory in 
question, when he found it an object of admiration among an 
humbler class of enquirers. This observation may be correct ; 
but perhaps a better reason may be given for Davy's want of 
confidence in his own theory. 

If the assumption of a number of unproved statements as 
facts afford any argument against the correctness of a theory, 
this one of Davy's must stand very low in our estimation. 
But, lest we should be charged with arrogance in thus speak- 
ing of that which was proposed by Davy, and is still sup- 
ported by an acknowledged scholar, we will give our reasons 
for the statement. Two admissions are required by this 
theory, and they appear to draw largely upon the faith of the 
reader, but it is absolutely necessary that he should admit 
the probability of the existence of a metallic nucleus, and its 
inflammability, or he must at once give up the theory itself. 
We must first allow the existence of a metallic nucleus. It 
is possible that the interior of our world consists of metalhc 
alloys, but we have as much reason to believe that it consists 
of water or of stone. We will, however, grant, for the sake 
of the argument, that the earth, beneath its superficial cover- 
ing, consists of metals, for it is only a matter of opinion, 
and we may imagine it one substance as well as another ; all 
that is required Ey ascertained facts is, that we should fix upon 
some heavy body. We are next required to admit that this 
metallic nucleus is of such a character that it is oxidised by 
the presence of water, the hydrogen being liberated and 
ignited. To determine the nature of the metallic nucleus, we 
must examine the character of the lava that is ejected, or of 
the earths composing the crust of our globe, which are sup- 
posed by this theory to have been at some former period a 
part of the metallic globe. Dr. Daubeny accurately states 
that silica, alumina, lime, and iron are the chief constituents 
of volcanic products. The metallic alloy, therefore, must be 
composed of silicon, aluminum, calcium, and iron. Now, of 
all electro-positive substances, silicon is the most incom- 
bustible : it may be made white hot in the open air without 
evincing any tendency to burn ; and, so far from decomposing 



Volcanoes. 4-35 

water at common temperatures, it may be boiled in that fluid. 
But there is every reason to believe that silicon is not a metal, 
but has a closer resemblance to carbon, a non-metallic sub- 
stance. But, however this may be determined, it is so far 
from alloying with the metals, that it has no tendency to unite 
with other bodies, except when in a nascent state, or when 
double affinities are exerted. We cannot help remarking 
that it was only a short time after Berzelius had discovered 
the properties of silicon, that Davy renounced his theory. A 
consideration of the properties of aluminum is equally fatal 
to the theory ; for it sustains no visible alteration by long boil- 
ing in water, even when in the state of fine powder, and only 
begins to oxidise when its temperature is raised to a red heat. 
Of calcium and iron we need not speak : the former is only 
an imaginary substance, and the properties of iron are too 
well known to require a remark. 

That any compound of these substances, in any propor- 
tion, should fulfil the conditions required in the theory, is 
utterly impossible. It is true that metallic alloys are more 
oxidisable than pure metals ; but we have given a reason for 
the supposition that, if the substances of which we have spoken 
were existent in a deoxidised state, it would not be in union 
with each other. If it could be imagined that the earth was 
originally a ball of potassium, there might be some reasons 
to support the theory, for then the decomposition of water, 
and the burning of potassuretted hydrogen, might be supposed 
to mimic the exhibitions of Etna, if not of Tomboro. But, 
as the constituent elements of lava evince no tendency to act 
agreeably to the requisitions of the theory which we have 
examined, we ought not to give them properties which do not 
belong to them. 

Dr. Daubeny has modified the details of this theory. He 
admits that the action of water is not of itself sufiicient to 
account for all the phenomena, and introduces the agency of 
atmospheric air. But it must be quite evident that, if our 
objections to Davy's theory be sound, they are equally so as 
applied to Dr. Daubeny's amendment. No one would have 
a theory of volcanic action suggested from pouring water 
upon a cold cannon shot, yet the chemical action is as strong 
in this instance as that which would be produced upon the 
unoxidised nucleus of the earth. Iron is much more readily 
oxidised than the bases of silica and alumina ; for in a spongy 
state it will decompose water, and become red hot, on being 
exposed to the air at common temperatures. We no more 
believe that this theory can be received as an explanation of 
the cause of volcanic action, than Southoy's assertion as a 

!  F 2 



436 Freshwatei' Fotmation at Copford^ 

philosophical fact, that the atmosphere of Elysium and the 
Fortunate Islands consists of the protoxide of nitrogen. 

But, independently of the chemical objections that we have 
urged, there are many derived from the physical constitution 
of bodies, such as the arrangement of the metallic nucleus; the 
impossibility of water ever penetrating to it ; the improbability 
of the presence of atmospheric air, and the doubt whether 
any chemical action could be developed under great pressures. 
Each of these might, and the sum of them would, lead us to 
the conclusion that the theory is doubtful, if not visionary. 

Another hypothesis attributes volcanic eruption to central 
heat. The cause of this central heat is variously accounted 
for by geologists, according to their particular notions or 
fancies. Some attribute it to one cause, and some to another ; 
but, whatever may be the origin of the singular phenomenon, 
it has, we think, been proved that the interior heat of the 
earth increases from its surface. It is very evident that this 
fact would afford an ingenious theorist the opportunity of 
creating a plausible hypothesis. We shall not attempt to 
explain the almost endless variety of opinions that have been 
entertained and defended upon the general idea that central 
heat is the cause of volcanic activity, as this article has already 
exceeded the space usually allotted to an individual subject; 
and, in closing the communication, it cannot be denied that 
the information already obtained, in relation to the activity of 
volcanoes, is too vague and limited to warrant the formation 
of a theory built upon observation.

Art. VIII. A Notice of some of the Contents of the Freshwater 
Formation at Copfordf near Colchester^ Essex. By J. Brown, 
Esq. 

Mr. Wood has, in p. 275., invited some correspondent in 
this neighbourhood to communicate notices on this subject. 
I, for one, have pleasure in offering the results of my own 
observations. 

From what attention I have given to this locality, I have 
only been able to obtain perfect specimens of the Valvata 
piscinalis. Some of these freshwater beds are mainly com- 
posed of fragments of shells, but in such a state that it is 
almost impossible to ascertain their species. Among the sand 
and small fragments are found numerous opercula (probably 
belonging to the genus Paludnia), but no entire shell: the 



near Colchester^ Essex. 4-37 

Valvata piscinalis appears to be the only species that has 
escaped destruction. I have, it is true, detected forms of the 
genus Planorbis in these beds; but, in trying carefully to 
remove them, they have invariably fallen to pow^der. 

The beds containing these lacustrine shells, and other or- 
ganic remains to be noticed, consist principally of white cal- 
careous marl and ferruginous sand, mixed with broken shells, 
and alternating for about 4 ft. in thickness; the whole sur- 
mounted by what was formerly called a diluvium, 3 ft. thick, 
consisting of brown clay, and gravel composed chiefly of 
rounded and angular flints, quartz boulders, and bouldered 
fragments of the trap rocks. These mineral substances, more 
or less mixed with sand or clay, and coloured with oxide of 
iron, constitute the surface of our neighbourhood : and are 
the source from which the materials are supplied for our 
excellent roads. 

Under the beds containing the shells and fragments is a 
stratum of lignite 3 in. thick, which divides these beds from 
a thick deposit of clay that lies beneath them; in this lignite 
I have found shells of the Cyclas rivicola in groups from the 
bed. Immediately above this lignite, and associated with the 
shells and fragments, I obtained a horn of the ox, and some 
large fragments of bone, and amongst them a scapula belong- 
ing to the same animal. This horn, or rather part of a horn 
(for both ends are truncated), measures 16 in. in circum- 
ference at the larger extremity, and is 21 J in. in length, not 
continuing to a point, but broken off to 2 in. in diameter at the 
smaller end : some of the fragments appear to be parts of 
the skull, and are very thick compared with the thickness of 
the skull of our recent ox. These remains were found, in the 
winter of 1832, in excavating for brick earth ; and I thought 
myself very fortunate in rescuing from destruction such me- 
morials of days long gone by. About a month ago, I also, 
fortunately, obtained, from the same stratum and the same 
spot, some more bones, with pieces of deer's horns, antlers, 
&c., which at present form a part of my little collection. 

Under the layer of lignite is found a deposit of fine blue 
clay, with mica regularly disseminated throughout it in very 
small plates; there is also much calcareous matter in it. This 
is a most excellent material for white bricks, chimney-pots, 
&c., for which it is extensively used. 

This clay is generally excavated to the depth of 8 ft., or 
10 ft., from the layer of lignite mentioned above. At this 
depth there are found many rounded portions of soft chalk, 
the size of walnuts, and some smaller, although we have no 
chalk formation nearer than Sudbury, which is fifteen miles

hence, unless it is to be found i7i situ at a moderate depth 
below this clay; which is, I think, not very improbable, con- 
sidering that these portions of soft chalk could not have been 
drifted a long distance without being dissipated by the trans- 
port. I only notice this circumstance in support of the con- 
tinuance of the chalk strata to our western coast, where it has 
been perforated in boring for water ; and [in the idea] that 
its basin is shallower, under this lacustrine deposit, than in 
many other places ; as many of the wells in this neighbour- 
hood are 50 ft. and 60 ft. deep, without getting through our 
gravel beds, although my own well, only 37 ft. deep, and 
within a mile and a half of Copford brickfield, penetrates the 
London clay about 2 ft. 

Although the shells of these strata are in a broken state, still, 
by an attentive observation, we can trace the forms of several 
genera; the Planorbis, Paludina, Valvata, and Cyclas; all of 
which are abundantly found living in the pools and ditches in 
this neighbourhood. 

Admitting the ox to which the horn above noticed was 
once attached, to have belonged to one of our lost species of 
Mammalia, its being found associated with recent Testacea 
is an illustration of Professor Lyell's observations on this in- 
teresting subject, in his most excellent work, the Principles 
of Geology, vol. iii., p. 1 40.

Art. IX. Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water^ of 
the Rhine ; by J. R. : >voith Rernarks, in Contribution to '^an 
Ansiver; by the Rev. W. B. Clarke, A.M. F.G.S. 

I DO not think the causes of the colour of transparent water 
have been sufficiently ascertained. I do not mean that effect of 
colour which is simply optical, as the colour of the sea, which 
is regulated by the sky above or the state of the atmosphere, 
but I mean the settled colour of transparent water, which has, 
vs^hen analysed, been found pure. Now, copper will tinge 
water green, and that very strongly ; but water thus impreg- 
nated will not be transparent, and will deposit the copper it 
holds in solution upon any piece of iron which may be thrown 
into it. There is a lake in a defile on the north-west flank of 
Snowdon, which is supplied by a stream which previously 
passes over several veins of copper : this lake is, of course, of 
a bright verdigrise green, but it is not transparent. Now, the 
colouring effect, of which I speak, is well seen in the waters 
of the Rhone and Rhine. The former of these rivefs, when 



of the Water of the Rhine, 439 

it enters the Lake of Geneva, after having received the tor- 
rents descending from the mountains of the Valais, is fouled 
with mud, or white with the calcareous matter which it holds 
in solution. Having deposited this in the Lake Leman * 
(thereby gradually forming an immense delta), it issues from 
the lake perfectly pure, and flows through the streets of Ge- 
neva so transparent, that the bottom can be seen 20 ft. below 
the surface, yet so blue, that you might imagine it to be a 
solution of indigo. In like manner, the Rhine, after purify- 
ing itself in the Lake of Constance, flows forth, coloured of a 
clear green ; and this, under all circumstances, and in all 
weathers. It is sometimes said that this arises from the tor- 
rents which supply these rivers generally flowing from the 
glaciers, the green and blue colour of which may have given 
rise to this opinion ; but the colour of the ice is purely optical, 
as the fragments detached from the mass appear simply white. 
Perhaps some correspondent can afford me some information 
on the subject. J. R. 

March, 1834.. 

I CANNOT say that I think the Rhine is so extremely clear 
and pellucid as J. R. states. In its passage through Germany, 
where it receives the tributary streams of many districts, it 
is, in places, very far from transparent ; and ievi persons who 
have made the passage from Mainz to Cologne in the steamers, 
can have failed to remark the shower of dirty calcareous matter 
which is constantly falling over the deck of the vessel, from 
the steam, as it is condensed in the air. At the junction of the 
Nahe with the Rhine at Bingen, the waters of the two rivers 
may be traced a considerable way in separate unmingled cur- 
rents, by the red tint of the former, which gains its hue from 
the red-sandstone country whence it flows. The Rhone, also, 
clear as it is immediately after leaving Geneva Lake, is, where 
it goes underground near Carouge, of the colour and appear- 
ance of pea soup. As to the colour of the Rhine waters, 
after leaving the Lake of Constance, that doubtless depends on 
causes similar to those which have given that well-known 
cerulean tint to the Rhone at Geneva ; arising from some un- 
known property of matter derived from the parent snows and 
ice of the mountains, which acts upon light, so as to reflect

44<0 On the Causes of the Colour 

the colours in question.* We know that the icebergs of 
the polar seas are frequently of an emerald green f, and 
the glaciers % of the Alps are of a green or a deep blue, 
and that the waters from them issue of a pale blue colour. 
As Mrs. Somerville has observed in her recent work 
On the Connexion of the Sciences (p. 174.), it is on the 
property of unequal absorption that " the colours of trans- 
parent media depend ; for they also receive their colour from 
their power of stopping or absorbing some of the colours of 
white light and transmitting others." This, however, J. R. 
seems aware of, in part. 

Mr. De la Beche has some remarks on the coloured waters 
of different seas, quoting Sir Gore Ouseley, in which greeri 
and blue water are alluded to. (Geological Manual, 1st ed. 
p. 89, 90.) All lakes are more or less coloured, even when 
most pellucid. There is a lake on the summit of Blencathra 
or Saddleback Mountain, in Cumberland, the deep waters of 
•which are quite black to look upon, and it is said that they 
reflect the stars in the daytime ; which, by the way, I could 
never observe, though frequently looking for them. The most 
perfectly clear expanse of water in England is Derwent- 

* The Rliine, from the Alps to the Lake of Constance, is blue; after- 
wards grass green ; then, after having received the waters of the Black 
Forest and Alsace, yellowish green. The Maine, traversing the red sand- 
stones of Franconia, takes a yellowish red tint, but in very cold seasons it 
becomes greenish blue by the precipitation of the oxide of iron ; it is amber 
grey when it is not coloured yellow by long rains. All the rivers of Ba- 
varia Proper are bluish green in winter, grass green in spring, and pale 
grass green in autumn. {New Edin. Phil. Jounu, Jan. 1830, p. 193.) 
Sir H. Davy (in his Salmonla) says, the colour of snow water is deep 
blue ; that the green tinge comes from the vegetables that grow on the 
banks ; and the yellow and brown, from turf; and that the green hue of 
the sea is derived from vegetable matter, iodine, and bromium. He re- 
lates some experiments with iodine on the ice of the glaciers. 

\ On the colour of icebergs, see Scoresby's Arctic Regions^ i. 254. 
The glacier of Rosboden in Switzerland, is all through of a dark blue : 
but green is a general colour. 

J It must be observed, that the ice of the glaciers is very different 
from common ice. It consists of snow which has been melted, frozen, and 
compressed, perhaps, a thousand times ; till it has become solid, hard, and 
often as compact as marble. I have frequently seen, at Geneva, cubes of 
alpine ice upon the table, used to cool the wine in the drinking-glasses. 
It may be also remarked, that it is in the warm months of the year that 
the ice of the previous colder season is generally subjected to the pro- 
cesses alluded to ; that, in those months, avalanches occur ; and that the 
alpine rivers, contrary to what occurs in colder localities, are most swoln 
with the waters arising from melted ice and snow. There are, however, 
certain seasons when, as in 1816, winter seems to extend throughout the 
year. It is asserted, by an observer, that not a single week, in 1816, passed 
without a fall of snow on Mont St. Bernard. I shall produce the quotation 
in another place. 



of the Water o/the Rhine, 441 

water : nothing can equal the brilliancy and accuracy of the 
reflections of the scenery from its surface. J. R. says, co- 
loured ice, when in minute fragments, is " simply white." 
The sky is of a deep blue, approaching to black, in great 
heights, yet a thin stratum of air is nearly white. The colour 
is, therefore, dependent on the quantity of the matter which 
absorbs or reflects. There is, says Mrs. Somerville, " no 
substance which is either perfectly opaque or perfectly trans- 
parent : the clearest crystal, the purest air or water, stop or 
absorb the rays of light when transmitted, and gradually ex- 
tinguish them as they penetrate to greater depths." (p. 173.) 
I cannot quote all that Mr. Scoresby has said upon this sub- 
ject; but he has fully detailed the facts, as observed by him in 
the polar seas, and has come to the same conclusion as Mrs. 
Somerville. The real colour, he says, of the sea, " may be 
recognised in storm or calm, in fine weather or foul, clear or 
cloudy, fair or showery, being always nearly the same " {Arctic 
Regions^ i. 175.); which agrees with what J. R. says of the 
Rhine. Mr. Scoresby says, also, the sea in the arctic regions is 
generally blue, but occasionally diversified ; since "in 1817, 
he fell in with such narrow stripes of various-coloured water, 
that he passed streams of pale green, olive green, and trans- 
parent blue, in the course often minutes' sailing" (p. 176.); 
" and that the different qualities of water were kept distinct 
from each other." He states that blue is the natural colour 
of the sea; and that the green water alluded to was coloured 
by myriads of medusae, &c., or the food of the whale. [See 
in this Magazine, VII. 222. note *.] " The water of 
the main ocean is well known to be as transparent and as 
colourless as that of the most pure springs ; and it is only 
when seen in very deep seas that any certain and unchange- 
able colour appears. This colour is commonly ultramarine 
blue, differing but a shade from the colour of the atmosphere, 
when free from the obscurity of cloud or haze. Where this 
ultramarine blue occurs, the rays of light seem to be absorbed 
in the water, widiout being reflected from the bottom ; the 
blue rays being only intercepted. But where the depth is 
not considerable, the colour of the water is affected by the 
quality of the bottom." (p. 173.) Wood, in 1676, sounded, 
off* Nova Zembla, in 80 fathoms ; in blue water, which was 
so transparent, that " even the shells on the ground were 
clearly visible." (p. 181.) Hudson says, in 1607, the sea 
was blue where ice was, and green where it was open. (p. 175.)*

And it grew wondrous cold ; 
And ice, mast high, came floating by, 
Green as an emerald."

44*2 Causes of the Colour of the Hhone and Rhine, 

From the summit of Skiddaw, in a very clear day, I once 
saw, very distinctly marked, all the sandbanks in the Solway 
Frith, by the yellowness of the water above them. This 
arose from the reflection and shallowness of the water. 

Stanley Green, April 3. 1834. W. B. Clarke. 



Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhone and Rhine, 
The Rhone, at Geneva, is some 1 7 ft. deep, but so exqui- 
sitely clear that a pebble may be seen in the bottom at that 
depth ; but, seen with its surface at a small angle, to the eye 
it appears of the most beauteous transparent blue. This, 
some assert, arises from the lake's waters being actually co- 
loured ; but the transparency of the waters en /«a55^ disproves 
this. The fact is, it arises from the colour of the bottom, 
which, being of the same substance as the neighbouring side 
of Jura, a calcareous tufa, is nearly white ; and the blue of 
the sky is thus reflected with such singular beauty. [Robert 
Mallet, Esq., Cajpel Street, Dublin; in Gard, Mag., viii. 526.) 

Mr. Mallet mistakes, I think, in two points. The side of 
the Jura is not " a calcareous tufa ; " nor is the bottom of the 
channel under the bridge at Geneva so "nearly white" as he 
states. The bottom is strewed with stones, broken pots, &c. ; 
and there is also an alluvial coat of mud, not, perhaps, very 
thick, but still sufficiently so to resist the current. Had the 
bottom been " "white,^* or " nearly white," the colour of the 
water would be green, and not blue. I would refer Mr. 
Mallet and J. R., upon this fact, to the very instructive and 
elaborate treatise of De Maistre, in the Bibliotheque Uni- 
verselle (an accurate translation of which, by Professor Gris- 
com, is published in the American Journal of Science and Arts 
for April, 1834*); in which treatise, actual experiment is 
brought forward to show that "jchite substances at the bot- 
tom of blue water reflect green light. The count alludes, in 
his paper, to the Rhone and the Rhine, to the green and blue 
tints of the glaciers, and to the colours of the sea near the 
shore and in deep places ; and introduces some discussion on 
the blueness of the sky and of the veins in the human body, 
and on the properties of mixed colours to reflect the blue 
rays. By far the most instructive account which I have seen 
is also there given of the singular grotto at Capri, called 
the Azure Grot; the description of which might, with good 
effect, be transferred to the pages of this Magazine. That 
description would be particularly illustrative of J. R.'s en- 

* " On the Colour of the Air and of deep Waters, and on some other 
analogous fugitive Colours," by Count Xavier de Maistre. 



Temperature in Connection with Elevation, 4-43 

quiries. Two extracts from other parts of the count^s memoir 
are here appended, as belonging to the subject before us, and 
which it would be wrong to omit : — " Although the blue 
colour of water is often marked by numerous causes, it is 
sometimes exhibited in all its intensity : a fine example of it 
is witnessed in looking at the Rhone from the bridge at Ge- 
neva. The river seems to flow from an ultramarine source. 
The spectator is in the most favourable situation for observing 
the internal reflection, disengaged, as much as possible under 
an open sky, from the reflection at the surface." (Griscom's 
translation, Ainer. Jonrn., xxvi. 68.) 

" The Ijluish green colour of crevices in the glaciers is 
occasioned in the same manner as that of water near shore : 
if the mass of ice were as great and homogeneous as that of 
the sea, the interior of the crevices would be blue ; but the 
ice contains air-bubbles, particles of snow, and fissures, which 
reflect the transmitted light, throwing it from one face to 
another of the crevice, until it finds an escape. These opaque 
substances in the glacier produce the same effect as a white 
surface in the depths of the sea." {Ibid., p. 70.) That De 
Maistre is correct may be shown by this, that our homeward- 
bound ships can, when out of sight of land, distinguish their 
approach to the Channel by observing the colour of the sea 
change from blue to green. Captain Basil Hall (somewhere, 
in one of his amusing works) speaks of the " reign of blue 
water," to designate the deep open sea. Every one who has 
happened to have been in a violent storm in the ocean, has 
seen huge green waves approaching his vessel ; the water 
composing which, in time of calm, would be blue. Seen 
horizontally, the wave, by transmitted light, becomes green. 

To sum up all, De Maistre concludes his remarks by 
observing that the effects alluded to above appear to him "to 
depend wholly on the peculiar property which the blue ray 
possesses of being reflected, in preference to other rays more 
or less refrangible, by the simple mechanical resistance of the 
molecules of bodies which reflect light." (p. 75.)

In the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal (Jan. — April, 
1833) I have published a series of observations, made in July 
and August, 1832, on the temperature of the Highland 
mountains. By these it appears, that, with a mean difference 
in elevation of 2055 ft., the mean difference of temperature 
was 9^° Fahr. Dividing the former by the latter, we should 
get only 216 ft. of ascent for 1° of temperature. The true 
average, however, should be drawn from the mean of the 
number of feet required to sink the thermometer 1° on the 
different days. The following are my results : —

The observations at the upper stations were usually made 
between 1 and 3 p.m. ; those at the lower stations preceding 
or following them by from two to six hours ; more usually by 
only two or three. This would, of course, give an excess of 



of Temperature in Connection "joith Elevation, 445 

1° or 2° to the upper stations. But, as a balance against this, 
it is to be remarked, that ascents were commonly commenced 
on fine mornings ; which, on some of the days, were followed 
by cold and rainy afternoons. Ben Loyal, and the first ascent 
of Ben Nevis, furnish examples of this; while on Ben Nevis, 
the second day. Red Cairn, and the Locheil and Braemar 
moors, the weather was warm and sunny. On Ben-na-muic- 
Duich and Ben Hope, there was thick mist : on the former, 
it was more dense towards the summit ; on the latter, it was 
partially transparent to the sun's rays near the summit of the 
hill, though very dense below. On the whole, I incline to 
beheve that these several sources of error would nearly coun- 
terbalance each other. 

From a few similar observations in Cumberland, during 
May and June of 1833, I obtained 298 ft. of ascent for a 
decrease of 1° of temperature ; the weather being dry, warm, 
and sunny. Other observations, in Caernarvonshire, in the 
beginning of May, 1832, give only 212 ft. for 1° of tempera- 
ture; the weather cold and humid. Otley*s Guide to the Lakes 
mentions incidentally that the difference of temperature between 
Keswick and the summit of Skiddaw is about 12°. This gives 
230 ft. for 1° of temperature ; but the author informed me that 
his average was only drawn from a few observations, not suf- 
ficient for much confidence. The following is a summary of 
these several conclusions: —

The only place of considerable elevation, the mean annual 
temperature of which has been determined with precision, is 
that of Lead Hills in Lanarkshire, at 1280 ft. Comparing 
the average temperature of it and of adjacent situations near 
the sea level, we find a much slower decrease of temperature 
th^n the preceding observations would lead us to expect : —

it as the standard for the diminution of temperature during 
the whole year, as well as in the summer. The mean annual

that of summer, 58°. From these data, the temperature of

In Otley's Guide to the Lakes it is stated, that, '•' on the 
sloping side of Helvellyn, about the distance of 300 yards, 
and 300 perpendicular feet below the summit, is a spring, 
called Brown-rigg Well, where the water issues, in all seasons, 
in a copious stream ; its temperature in the summer months 
being from 40° to 42°." The height of this spring must be 
about 2750 ft. In May of 1833, I found the temperature of 
a feeble spring (in very hot weather), at about 350 ft. of ele- 
vation, to be 49^° of a thermometer graduated by Ronchetti 
of Manchester ; and of a spring-drain, at 450 ft., the tempe- 
rature v/as S^^ : but as this thermometer stands 2J° above 
thermometers obtained from Adie, the temperatures may be 
called 47° and 51^°.

ation on this subject.

Art. XI. Facts and Arguments in Relation to the Causes of a 
singular Appearance of a Rainboxuy of an unusual Appearance 
of the Skj/, of Mirage, of Devo, and of Hoar-Frost. By A 
Subscriber. 

Along with B. (IV. 79.), I have been looking for an 
explanation, from some correspondent, of the phenomenon 
described in III. 544., under the head of " Notice of a sin- 
gular Appearance of the Rainbow, by E. G. ; " and, with a view 
of recalling attention to the subject, I beg to submit the fol- 
lowing extracts from Sir D. Brewster's treatise on Optics, in 
Lardner's Cyclopaedia, p. 269, 270. : — 

" Many peculiar rainbows have been seen and described. 
On the loth of August, 1665, a faint rainbow was seen, at 
Chartres, crossing the primary rainbow at its vertex. It was 
formed by reflection from the river." 

To save a new cut, I have altered the letters of reference 
in the next passage, to make them correspond with the dia- 
gram in III. 544. 
[which we here repeat 
iJg' 57.)]. In ad- 
dition to which, it will 
be necessary to sup- 
pose that the segment 
E F reaches to a ; and 
that there is a similar 
segment on the left 
side, which I shall call e' f' : the arch f' e'e f thus being the 
remaining part of the circle of which the primary bow a b is 
a portion. 




Smgtdar Appearance of a Rainbow* 4-49 

" On the 6th of August, 1698, Dr. Halley, when walking 
on the walls of Chester, observed a remarkable rainbow, a b 
is the primary bow; c d, the secondary; andr'E'EF, the 
new bow intersecting the secondary bow c d, and dividing 
it nearly into three equal parts. Dr. Halley observed the 
points e' e to rise, and the arch [of the new bow] e' e gradually 
to contract, till at last the two e' e [of the secondary bow], and 
e' e [of the new bow], coincided ; so that the secondary iris, 
for a great space, lost its colours, and appeared like a white 
arch at the top. The new bow (f' e' e f) had its colours in 
the same order as the primary one (a b), and, consequently, 
the reverse of the secondary bow ; and, on this account, the 
two opposite spectra at e' and E counteracted each other, and 
produced whiteness. The sun at this time shone on the river 
Dee, which was unruflBed; and Dr» Halley found that the 
bow f' e' e f was only that part of the circle that would have 
been under the castle, bent upwards by reflection from the 
river. 

" A third rainbow, seen between the two common ones, 
and not concentric with them, is described in Rozier's Jotir- 
nal^ and is doubtless the same phenomenon as that observed 
by Dr. Halley." 

Now, though it niciy be very presumptuous in an anony- 
mous individual like myself, to object to an explanation 
sanctioned by the names of Halley and Brewster, yet I am 
obliged to say that it is as unsatisfactory to me as it seems to 
be to E. G. ; and that I, therefore, consider the problem as 
yet unsolved. I cannot imagine the sort of reflection sup- 
posed by it possible ; except on such an inadmissible principle 
as that the rainbow is the base of a hollow cone of prismatic 
light proceeding from the sun, and rendered visible by being- 
received upon falling rain, or the clouds, or the earth, as a 
screen. Still, however, as in the instances mentioned, the 
phenomenon seems to have been observed in the neighbour- 
hood of an extent of water, it may somehow depend on 
reflection ; but, as it would be almost vain to attempt a solu- 
tion without being perfectly acquainted with such circum- 
stances as the position of the observer, and the relative 
situations of the bow and the water, as well as the state of 
the latter, it would be useful if E. G. would oblige your 
readers with such particulars of the instances witnessed by 
him as he can now recollect, in reference to these points. 

E. G.'s question ought not to be lost sight of, " What 

becomes of the received opinion that the eye of the observer 

must be in the apex of the cone of which the bow is the 

base?" (III. b^:l:,.) How is that opinion to be reconciled

450 Unusual Appearance in the Sky, 

with the fact of two bows, not concentric, having been seen 
by the same person at one time ? 

A very unusual Appearance in the Sky. (III. 199.) — The 
Rev. W. B. Clarke will find an explanation of this appear- 
ance in Sir D. Brewster's treatise on Optics, in Lardner's 
Cabinet Cyclopaedia, p. 277 — 279. It is not very uncommon : 
I have myself seen it several times towards sunset, and once 
very distinctly ; on which occasion the eastern horizon was 
more cloudy than the rest of the heavens. " This," says Sir 
David, " seems to be necessary as a ground for rendering 
visible such feeble radiations." Speaking of an instance 
observed by himself, he adds : — "A few minutes after the 
phenomenon was first seen, the converging lines were black, or 
very dark ; an effect which seems to have arisen from the lu- 
minous beams having become broad and of unequal intensity : 
so that the eye took up, as it were, the dark spaces between 
the beams more readily than the luminous beams them- 
selves." On this I may observe, that an additional reason for 
the dark spaces attracting the eye is, that the light of the con- 
verging beams little exceeds, and, near the horizon, rather falls 
short ot^ the average brightness of the rest of the sky. 

" The phenomenon is entirely one of perspective." The 
beams of light arise from a portion of the sun's rays passing 
through openings in the clouds, while the adjacent portions 
are obstructed. These rays, practically, may be considered 
parallel; and, consequently, according to the laws of per- 
spective, must appear, to a spectator on the earth's surface, 
to converge towards each extremity; on the same principle 
of perspective, clouds, carried along by the wind in lines 
parallel to its course, seem to diverge from the windward 
horizon, and to converge towards the leeward. 

The " singular Phenomenon " observed by L. F., and de- 
scribed in III. 200., is noticed by Sir D. Brewster, in his 
treatise on Optics, in Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopcedia, chap, xiv, 
p. 113., " on the colours of fibres and grooved surfaces." 

Mirage. — When I wrote the article in III. 484 — 486., I 
had seen no explanation of the phenomenon, except that pro- 
posed by Y., in III. 200. Since that time, I have seen many 
notices of it, and several theories; but none of them do I 
prefer to my own. In the present, I mean to confine myself 
to the following, by Professor Jameson, in the eighth volume 
of the Edifiburgh Cabinet Library, p. 254, 255. : — 

" Mileage. In viewing distant objects, it often happens, 
under certain circumstances, that these objects present many 
images which are straight, oblique, or inverted, and always 
more or less changed in the contour. It is the appearance 
of these images, without any visible reflector to produce them, 



Miraae. 451 



*eD 



which constitutes mh^age. In explanation of this phenomenon, 
it may be remarked, that, as soon as the soil becomes heated, 
the lower stratum of air is also affected by the calorific in- 
fluence. Numerous aerial currents are established, and, an 
undulatory motion taking place in the air, distant objects 
become changed in form, and variously distorted and broken. 
If, when these changes are going on, a calm should prevail, 
and the mass of atmosphere upon the plain remain at rest 
while the stratum in contact with the ground becomes gra- 
dually heated, mirage will arise. In such cases, the observer 
will see distant objects in their natural positions and forms ; 
but, belotiD them, these images will be seen reversed, and the 
spectator believe that he is looking at a reflection from the 
snrfiice of a body of water. The sky, also, joins in com- 
pleting the illusion, its images being reflected in the same 
manner. The whole visible appearances, the French philo- 
sophers who visited Egypt remark, are, indeed, the same as 
those usually exhibited by water. All the laws by which the 
observer has been accustomed to judge of the existence of 
w^ater, viewed at a distance, are here called into action; and 
the man of science as well as the peasant alike find themselves 
deceived." 

In this description of the phenomenon, it is stated that 
distant objects are seen in their proper positions ; and, at the 
same time, under them their reversed images, as if reflected 
from the surface of water. The sky, also, is in the same 
manner reflected ; the whole appearances, in short, being the 
same as those usually exhibited by water ; and the explanation 
is, that these reversed images are owing to reflection from an 
invisible mirror ; that is, from a supposed reflecting surface 
at the place where two strata of different densities are in 
contact : which (speaking from memory) is, I think, the 
theory of the French philosophers referred to as explaining 
the phenomenon. 

I have seen this kind of mirage, I dare say, a thousand 
times ; and have often attentively observed it for a length of 
time, with a view of accounting for it; and I have to say, 
that the appearances, though like, are not the same as, those 
usually exhibited by water. The images seen by me were 
always very indistinct; though, generally, their colours were 
tolerably bright, their outlines were undefined, and they more 
or less approached to a triangular form, the base being upper- 
most ; appearing, on the whole, very much as if reflected 
from water slightly ruffled by a light breath of wind. The 
images were nevei' reversed, but invariably erect: though this 
was not always easily made out ; for, from the constant form 

G c 2 



4<52 Mi rase 



t)' 



just mentioned, the image of a hill, a tent, or of a house with 
a steep roof, appeared at the first glance distinctly reversed ; 
but if the hill had a white building on its summit, it might 
always be seen that, if it appeared in the image, it was towards 
the base, not at the summit, of the hill ; so, if the house had 
white walls and a roof of red tiles, in the image the roof and 
walls seemed to have changed places. 

But the hypothesis of a reflecting surface at the place where 
the rarefied stratum and the dense one over it meet, will by no 
means account for, it is even contradicted by, other observed 
facts. On such a supposition, to see the image the eye must 
be raised into the dense stratum above the supposed mirror, 
and to make it disappear, the eye would only have to be lowered 
into the rare stratum below it. But the facts are, that^ as the 
eye is raised, the mirage gradually disappears, and as it is 
lowered it gradually increases, till at last, when brought close 
to the ground, all is mirage, even the soil within a few feet not 
being distinguishable. This I have often tried. Belzoni says 
{Narrative, p. 196.), " If the traveller stand elevated much 
above the mirage, the apparent w^ater seems less united and 
less deep ; for, as the eyes look down upon it, there is not 
thickness enough in the vapour on the surface of the ground 
to conceal the earth from the sight. [This is Belzoni's theory, 
but I quote him solely for his facts.] But if the traveller be 
on a level with the horizon of the mirage, he cannot see 
through it, so that it appears to him clear water. By putting 
my head first to the ground, and then mounting a camel, the 
height of which might have been about 10 ft. at the most, I 
found a great difference in the appearance of the mirage." 

In stating the result of my own experience, I do not mean 
to deny that other observers may have seen reversed images * ; 
but / have never seen them, and therefore I have come to the 
conclusion that they are not characteristic of this kind of 
mirage. I am also of opinion that hasty observers, misled by 
the extraordinary resemblance of the whole to objects reflected 
from water, have often taken it for granted that the indistinct 
images were reversed, when, in reality, they may have been 
erect ; and that, in consequence, much perplexity has arisen, 
and the idea of a reflecting surface has been had recourse to, to 
account for this, perhaps imaginary, part of the phenomenon. 

* This communication has no reference to those cases of unusual 
refraction where images are seen in various positions, erect, reversed, and 
multiplied, feir D. Brewster mentions that Dr. WoUaston, in looking 
through a square glass bottle, containing water floating above syrup, saw 
an object in its proper position, and under it an inverted image, but whether 
by reflection or refraction, he does not say. This experiment seems to 
have some relation to mirage, and to make against my theory. 



Deio and Hoar-Frosf. - 453 

I shall conclude by repeating my own explanation in a few 
words. In ordinary states of the atmosphere, the air is more 
dense towards the surface of the earth, and, in consequence of 
the refraction thereby produced, distant elevated objects appear 
higher than they really are ; but, in the case under consider- 
ation, a stratum of heated, and, consequently, rarefied air, rest- 
ing on the surface of the ground, produces an effect the very 
reverse : distant elevated objects are seen lo'doer than they are, 
by an eye placed near but below the upper surface of the rare- 
fied stratum, while from this situation of the eye they will at 
the same time be seen nearly in their true places. 

Observations cm Dew and Hoar-Frosty principally with re- 
ference to a paragraph in III. 562.— If we leave solution and 
precipitation out of the question, and admit that water exists 
in the solid, liquid, and aeriform states, in consequence of 
being combined with a less or greater quantity of heat, we 
shall remove some of the difficulties stated by J. M. Having 
thus premised, we may expect, from analogy, that, if the heat 
thus necessary to retain water in its aeriform state be abstracted, 
it will reassume its liquid form, and, if more heat continue to 
be withdrawn, it will take the solid state, and freeze. This, in 
fact, we find to be the case. A greater or less quantity of 
aqueous vapour is always mixed with the air of the atmosphere ; 
if, therefore, a body at a temperature considerably lower than 
that of the atmosphere be exposed to the air, it will abstract 
heat from the air and vapour in contact with it, till at last the 
latter, being deprived of that portion requisite to sustain it in 
the gaseous state, will deposit itself on the body in the form 
of dew. The degree just necessary to produce deposition is 
termed the de'w point. If the temperature is sufficiently low, 
the dew will freeze and become hoar-frost. 

From this it follows that dew, speaking of it as a condens- 
ation of aqueous vapour, may be formed at any temperature 
under the boiling point ; but, in the more common accept- 
ation of the word, dew will not be formed except when the 
surface of the ground is at a considerably lower temperature 
than the air immediately over it; and this will rarely be the 
case except when the atmosphere is calm and clear, and the 
sun is absent. For though all bodies on the earth's surface 
are constantly throwing off their heat by radiation, yet, while 
the sun, the great source of heat, is shining, they will re- 
ceive more than they radiate ; and when the sky is overcast, 
the heat radiated by the clouds will prevent their cooling 
down much below the atmosphere : but a cloudless sky 
radiates little or no heat towards the earth, consecjuently 
bodies on its surface exposed to this clear sky must neces- 

G G 3 



4*54 Dew and Hoar-Frost. 

sarily fall in temperature, if situated so as not to receive heat 
from other radiating bodies in their neighbourhood.* 

When bodies are thus exposed, some of them are found 
to part with their heat faster than others: the former are 
therefore called good radiaters, and may be observed covered 
with dew ; while the latter, called bad radiaters, remain dry. 
In fact, each body will cool down, and receive a deposition, in 
proportion as it is a good radiater. 

A calm atmosphere is necessary. In order to the de- 
position of dew, the air and vapour must remain under the 
influence of the cold body until their temperature is brought 
down to the dew point. Wind not only prevents this, but 
rapidly reduces the objects exposed to it to a common tem- 
perature, thus neutralising the effects of radiation. 

Fluids are bad conductors. Heat is slowly propagated 
through them, when applied above or abstracted from below. 
The cold, therefore, in the case we are considering, extends 
to no great height ; indeed, it is generally confined to a few 
feet from the surface of the ground. I often observe a ther- 
mometer placed outside, at a height of about 7 ft., stand at 
40° when the ground is white with hoar-frost ; and the Rev. 
W. T. Bree (IV. 480.) has mentioned many striking instances 
in point. The extent of the cold stratum is very obvious in 
the neighbourhood of water; the partially condensed steam 
from it marking the limits very distinctly. (See, again, IV. 
480.) 

I have said that dew will rarely be seen except in clear 
weather f, for otherwise the surface of the ground will seldom 
be found colder than the air; but it sometimes happens. 
Last Saturday night (Nov. 18. 1833), the thermometer sunk 
to 29°, and during Sunday did not rise to 33° in the shade ; 
at night it fell to 28°, and on the morning of the 18th it sud- 
denly rose to 47J°, the atmosphere becoming dull: a calm 
prevailed all the time. The consequence was a copious de- 
position of moisture, which, on the grass, indeed, could be 
distinguished from the melted hoar-frost, but was very remark- 
able on stones that had been previously dry. The rooms in 
my house that had been without fires had partaken of the 
severe cold, the temperature being 40°, and the windows of 
them, as might have been expected, were covered with con- 
densed vapour on the outside. This, though of the same 
nature with dew, is not what, in common language, we would 
call by that name. 

* Dew and hoar-frost are seldom observed in the close streets of towns, 
or under shady trees. 

f The common people here call a clear calm atmosphere " a frosty sky."

While on this subject, I may observe, in regard to high, 
exposed, and sloping grounds escaping the effects of hoar- 
frost, while low grounds suffer, that, in addition to the causes 
that have been assigned, it may be the case that the cold 
stratum, as fast as it is formed in such situations, may, from its 
increased density, slide down to the lower levels, and be 
replaced by a warmer stratum, and so on ; thus helping to 
produce the destructive effects of frost in low situations, so 
often noticed.

Mammtferous Animals. — Perforation of a LeadenPipe 
by Rats. — The sharpness of the incisory teeth of the Glires, 
and the power with which these animals can employ them, are 
well known to those who have unfortunately allowed a finger 
to come within the range of those of any one of the species. 
How readily will a squirrel penetrate the hardest shells of a 
nut; and how do we hear, night after night, the patient and 
persevering grinding of a rat's teeth, working its way through 
some particular plank or joist below a skirting-board, forming 
a barrier interrupting the intruder in its progress towards a 
larder, storeroom, or closet, wherein its instinctive shrewd- 
ness assures it that its labour will meet with a plentiful 
reward ! It was not, however, till very lately, that I had 
learned to what extent rats will employ their teeth, when bent 
on making their way towards a desired point, whatever be the 
nature of the intervening obstacle. 

The facts of the case which informed me of this are the 
following : — The kitchen and scullery, &c., of a gentleman's 
house, were supplied with water from a pool at some distance, 
by means of a leaden pipe about \^m, in external diameter, 
with a bore of about | in. in diameter ; thus leaving a solid 
circumference of metal varying from J in. to | in. in thickness. 
This pipe, on reaching to the building, was carried under a 
flagged pavement, and embedded in brickwork, till it termin- 
ated in a cock, at a convenient height, for the purpose of 
affording the supply of water. For some months in the sum- 
mer the pool of water had been intentionally lowered while 
some improvements near its banks had been carried on, and 
the pipe had, in consequence, never been used. I know not 
how far this circumstance influenced the operations of the 
rats, whose avidity for water, more especially in dry weather, 
is such as to induce them to lay aside their usual shy and

secluded habits, and expose themselves, even in the middle of

days of drought last summer, on the first drops of rain falling 
from a slight shower, a whole colony of rats emerged from

building. There they remained, old and young, only occa- 
sionally retreating, but immediately again advancing, in the 
presence of several persons, myself amongst others, assembled 
to witness so singular a troop ; and there did they remain till 
a gun was loaded, and fired amongst them, by which four or 
five were killed on the spot, and many others, doubtless, 
severely wounded.* But to return to the leaden pipe: some 
repairs being necessary, a bricklayer was employed to open 
the brickwork surrounding the pipe, when he found that the 
mortar had been already removed, and a passage eflPected by 
rats to the side of the pipe, which, it might have been sup- 
posed, would completely check their progress. Great, how- 
ever, was his surprise, when, on laying bare the pipe, he found 
it entirely laid open to the extent of about 4 in. in length, and 
considerably more than half the solid circumference of lead 
actually removed. Not a doubt could exist as to the cause ; 
for on the surface of the edges of the opening were continuous 
marks of rats' teeth, deeply impressed, with as much uniformity 
and regularity as if indented by a carpenter's file. How long 
the rats, or more probably the rat (for, in so confined a space, 
I think, it would have been difficult for more than one to have 
gnawed and nibbled at a time), had been occupied at this 
tough job, it is not possible to determine ; but the effects were 
such as to convey a very fearful impression of what might be 
effected by these animals in the work of destruction ; and, at 
all events, how little resistance the thickest and most solid 
planks would make to their united and persevering efforts. I 
send a sketch of the piece of leaden pipe sawed off" by the 
plumber, and now in my possession. — E, S., F.L,S.

Mammiferous Animals. 4^57 

Singula?' Bobbery committed by Bats, — A clergyman, in the 
spring of last year (1833), had a brood of turkeys, amounting 
to a dozen or fourteen in number, when, one morning, all of 
them, with the exception of two, had disappeared. In vain 
was the dairymaid sent out in all directions to search for the 
remainder ; not a vestige was visible, in the shape of body or 
limb, to account for their death by vermin; and the whole 
remained a mystery, though suspicions rested on rats, which 
abounded in the barns and stabling adjacent to the pen in 
which the mother turkey and her young brood had passed 
the night. At this moment, when all were either deliberating 
on what could possibly have happened, or diligently searching 
for the delinquent, a farmer joined the party, who, in the 
course of investigation, turned their attention to a slight loose- 
ness of a piece of turf near the hedge bordering on the lawn, 
on uplifting which, a hole appeared, and, on stooping down, a 
slight noise was heard, which induced him to widen the orifice, 
and insert his hand ; when, to the astonishment of all, he 
pulled out one of the young turkeys, and, on still farther ex- 
tending their excavations, the whole of the remainder were 
discovered ; and, what was still more extraordinary, all were 
alive, with the exception of two (if I recollect my friend's 
report correctly), and apparently not much the worse for their 
imprisonment; and, to crown the discovery, at the farther 
extremity the plunderer himself was found. That instinct 
should have prompted the marauder to carry off one, or even 
two or more, if his appetite could command such a number, is 
not beyond credence ; but that he should, with a view to future 
provision, furnish his subterranean larder with a sufficiency of 

pletely, and could not at first tell whether it was done for meat or malice. 
The fact is, the rat begins his operations under ground among the soft and 
tender roots, and eats upwards as far as he finds the wood soft enough for 
his purpose, which is just below the surface : the consequence is, that the 
tree will often remain erect, and appear to the eye as if nothing had 
happened to it : but, of course, it throws out no leaves in the spring, and, 
on taking hold of it, you find it loose, and ready to come up with a touch.'* 
We have witnessed the same effect produced upon young willow plants 
growing in somewhat marshy soil, and have always referred it to the water 
campagnol, or water rat (Arvicola amphibia). All of the Rodentia have, 
we presume, the power of cutting with that remarkable evenness which 
Mr. Bree has mentioned ; hares have, it is well known, in cutting their 
way (muse) through young hawthorn hedges. The fact of rats gnawing 
through lead is, perhaps, less remarkable than that of Cerambyx bajulus L. 
making its way out even through sheet lead one sixth of an inch thick, 
when this has happened to have been nailed upon the rafter in which the 
insect has assumed its final metamorphosis. Holes a quarter of an inch wide 
in their longer diameter have, it is stated, been found drilled by insects of 
this species through such lead, and lead has been discovered in the stomach 
of the larva. (See Kirby and Spence's Inirod., ed. 1822, i. 232. note d.)]

had been taken in a mole-trap, under ground, more than a 
mile from any river. I have also been informed of the water 
rat's being dug out of the ground in a potato field. No 
motive can be supposed to have brought the water rat into a 
mole creep, but in search of the mole to devour it. The 
weasel also pursues the same prey. — «/. Couch, Polperro,

remains of earthworms, being, as I have noticed in V. 490.,

that the water rat, in the above case, was but seeking earth- 
worms in the mole's run.] 

Birds. — Of the Great Bustard {O^tis tarda L.,Jig, 58. $ ), 
three females resorted, last spring, to Great Massingham Heath, 

Norfolk, for incubation. Their 
eggs consisted of two pairs and a 
single one. These were taken away, 
under the impression that, as there 
was no male bird, they were good 
for nothing. I have one of the pairs. 
Does the male associate with the 
female during the period of incu- 
bation ? Bewick says that " the 
male is said to live apart after the 
females have been impregnated." 
Is this the case ? If it be, it may 
be well, should female bustards again visit the same place, not 
to deprive them of their eggs. A correspondent, in VI. 513., 
states that the last bustard seen at Icklingham " was a hen 
bustard, sitting on six or seven eggs." Is he correct in stating- 
that there were so many eggs ? I have always understood 
that the number of a bustard's eggs never exceeds a pair. —

Hooks feeding on Grain, <^x. — Sir, In reply to J. D., who 
hints (p. 244.) that " the soil's being covered up, in summer 
and autumn, with ground crops, may prevent access to it 
for ground grubs and insects, and so account for the rook's 
then feeding on grain, &c.," I would observe, that the rooks 
feed quite as much on grain in the spring (March and April), 
when they are not driven to that necessity by the ground 
being covered up by crops. Neither will the excuse offered 
be sufficient to exculpate the rooks from the charge of their 
autumnal depredations on the corn ; for the ground is bare 
enough at that season to afford them an opportunity to stock 
it up in search of grubs ; and, accordingly, they do then stock 
it up, and destroy immense numbers. The real fact is, and 
it must not be disguised, that my friends the rooks have a 
natural taste and propensity for grain, especially when it is 
a little swollen by having lain a few days in the ground; 
and, accordingly, the periods at which they commit the 
greatest depredations are just after the grain is sown (the 
wheat in autumn, and the oats and barley in spring), and 
before it is come up. I have known the blackbirds do me 
much mischief in the summer and autumn, especially if the 
season be dry, by plucking up most unceremoniously low- 
tufted alpine plants (e. g. *Saxifraga //ypnoides, Arenaria bale- 
arica, Sibthorpm europae^a, &c.), in order to get at the grubs * 

* [Those of some Curculionidae : not rarely those of the Curculio vas- 
tator Marshaiiiy which, according to Curtis's Guide, is a synonyme of Otio- 
rhynchus Ger. plcipes F. It is not a little vexatious, to those who cultivate 
plants with a passion for them, to find the tufts of *S'axifragae and other 
plants (but more frequently the tufted ^axifragae) turned or turning to a 
brown colour, and, at a lifting up with the hand, come clear off the soil 
upon which they had grown, and appearing partly rootless, and in a dying 
state. On exploring the soil below, insects in the pupa state (they have 
wings formed, and pretty obvious) are discoverable. The larvae of these, 
it may be presumed, had fed upon the roots of the plants. A fine plant 
of the Crassula cordata was once kept upon a stand in the drawingroom, 
near a window, by the late Sir Thomas Cullum, Bart. : it flourished, and 
its branches hung tressily and prettily over the edge of the pot, and bore 
flowers in its season. After this plant had been kept some time here, it 
died suddenly, and, on exploring tne soil, larvae or pupas of an insect were. 
Sir Thomas informed me, discovered in it : doubtless those of one of the 
Curculionidae. The grape vine, in forcing-houses, has its sprouting herbage 
and embryo fruit not a little ravaged by an Otiorhynchus. O. raucus has 
abounded about Liverpool in the spring of this present year (1834), and 
eaten to an unwelcome extent of the leaves of the trees and shrubs of that 
neighbourhood. These facts aid in showing the value of the agency of 
the black birds, however much or little they may do towards reducing the 
numbers of the weevils.]

which He just below the surface, and feed on the roots of the 
plants. Sometimes whole patches of these and similar plants 
have been nearly stocked up from the rockwork, or the pots 
in which they grew. But to return to the rooks : I am sur- 
prised to find it mentioned (p. 24-4.), as a new fact in natural 
history, that " the husk of grain taken by the rook is sepa- 
rated, in the rook's stomach, from the grain itself, and is 
afterwards discharged from the mouth of the rook in masses 
of the size [nearly] of a pigeon's egg'' This fact I have 
repeatedly observed, and any one may satisfy himself of it, 
who will but examine the ground under a rookery in the 
spring, where he will find the surface strewed with abun- 
dance of such rejectamenta.* I may here mention one cir- 
cumstance connected with this fact, which is not noticed by 
your correspondent : the rooks, to grind their corn, seem to 
require stones, like other millers f; and, for this purpose, 
they swallow lumps of brick, grit, broken platter, coal, and 
other like substances (but chiefly brick), which are discharged 
again along with the pellets of husks. These fragments of 
brick, &c., are from the size of a vetch seed, or less, to that 
of a damson stone, rough and irregular sometimes, but 
usually more or less rounded or bouldered by the action of 
grinding in the bird's stomach, before they are thrown up in 
the pellets ; and the pellets, in consequence, are sometimes 
slightly tinged with a red or brickdust colour. I herewith 

* [Mr. Hewitson, in his British Oology ^ t. 71., has spoken of it as a fact 
hitherto unnoticed, except in this Magazine, VII. 244. In the case de- 
scribed by Mr. Hewitson, " the whole surface of the ground underneath 
the trees [which bore the rookery] was thickly strewed with disgorged 
pellets similar to those ejected by the owl, but consisting entirely of the 
husks of oats j and must have contained, altogether, the remains of many 
bushels. [We shall add his speculation on this fact.] I suspect, however, 
that the rook is by no means so destructive from choice as one might be 
led (from what I have stated) to infer ; and that the dryness of the spring, 
and the consequent difficulty in obtaining its usual food, had driven it to 
a more than usual destruction of grain. If I am right, it will also account 
for the habit having remained unnoticed." 

Bushnan, in his Introduction to the Study of Nature, proposes, in p. 157., 
that birds adapt the time of rearing their young to the period in which 

there will be a certainty of procuring food suitable for them " The 

rook hatches in April, when the turning up of the soil affords abundance 
of grubs and worms, which could not be found at a later season ; and, when 
this source fails, the common chafer affords a long supply." How long 
was the rook in existence ere tillage was much practised ?] 

-|- Most, if not all granivorous birds, I believe, as well as some others, 
swallow grit, in order to promote the trituration of their food. I have 
sometimes been much amused by seeing chickens, especially such as have 
been confined in a pen, and cannot help themselves to grit, swallow with 
avidity large pieces of broken oyster shell, which have been given to them, 
of the size of a sixpence, or larger. — W. T, B.

I have somewhere lately met with an extract from Jesse's 
Gleanings in Natural History^ in which it is contended that 
the rooks do no injury to the agriculturist. After speaking 
in just commendation of the rooks, and of their utility in 
destroying grubs, this pleasing writer goes on to say : — "In 
order to be convinced that these birds are^beneficial to the 
farmer, let him observe the same field in which his plough- 
man and his sower are at work : he will see the former fol- 
lowed by a train of rooks, while the sower will be unattended, 
and his grain remain untouched." Our own characters, I 
believe, often suffer by the extravagant and injudicious praises 
of our friends ; for, when men come to perceive that we do 
not possess all the good qualities, or at least do not possess 
them to that extent which we are said to do, they are apt not 
to give us credit even for those which really belong to us. 
I fear it may fare the same with the rooks in the present in- 
stance. Some who read the above erroneous statement, will 
be likely to condemn the rooks iri toto^ and to discredit 
what is most truly said in their favour, on account of the 
error mixed up along with it. Mr. Jesse makes the rooks 
too good by nearly half. They may not follow the sower, it 
is true, because, as already stated, they prefer the grain when 
it has become a little swollen, from having been a short time 
in the ground. But that they do eat grain, the pellets we 
have been speaking of are an incontrovertible proof. If far- 
ther evidence were needed, I might mention what occurred 
to myself this spring. A few days after the oats were sown, 
my man came to complain to me of the rooks, which, he 
said, were settling on the newly sown ground in numbers, 
and pecking up the corn like a flock of chickens. The fact 
was even so ; and, in corroboration of it, abundance of dis- 
gorged pellets, consisting of oat husks and brickbats, was 
soon perceived under the trees of the adjoining rookery. 
" Keeping crows," as it is called in this part of the country, 
that is, guarding the newly sown fields from the depredations 
of rooks, is a very usual occupation for boys and children 
who are unfit for more laborious employment. Mr. Water- 
ton himself (the friend and advocate of all wild animals, even 
of some which are usually accounted vermin) does not deny 
(p. 102.) the rook's propensity, " if not narrowly watched," 
to peck a little new-sown corn. Let it not be supposed that, 
in making the above statement, my object is to injure the 
character of these useful and amusing birds. On the con-

trary, I am one of their firmest friends, being fully convinced 
(indeed, it has been proved by actual experiment) that they 
are, on the whole, beneficial to the farmer. Unquestionably, 
they commit some injury; but then, by way of compensation, 
they do a vast deal of good. Only let the balance be fairly 
struck, and the good they do will be found greatly to pre- 
ponderate. — W, T, Bree. Allesley Rectory, May 12. 1834<.

The Swift (H. A^pus L.) builds its oxion Nest : this Nest de- 
scribed, — It is generally understood, I believe, that the swift 
occupies, for the purpose of incubation, the deserted nest of 
the sparrow (i^ringilla domestica L.), Most authors agree 
on this point ; I suspect for want of opportunities of examin- 
ing, personally, the nests of swifts, in consequence of these 
birds invariably selecting the roofs of churches, houses, &c., 
as the places for their nests. By comparing the statements 
of different authors, it will be, I think, found that they have, 
in fact, copied from each other. I must, however, except one 
author, of a very recent date, from this charge. Mr. Mudie 
says, in his British Naturalist, " the nest is constructed much 
in the same manner as that of the common swallow." A. R.Y. 
has, in V. 59., well commented on the fallacy of this notion 
[and his remarks should be read in connection with this sub- 
ject]. In the Architecture of Birds, the swift is classed with 
the " parasite birds;" and there is a quotation from Montbeil- 
lard, Oiseaux, viii. 218., who, after describing the nest as 
" consisting of a great variety of substances, stalks of corn, 
dry grass, moss, &c. &c.," says, " of seven nests found under 
the head of a church porch, 15 ft. from the ground, there were 
only three which had a regular cup shape, and of which the 
materials were more or less intervooven, and mth greater order 
than usual in sparro'wi nests ; they had also more moss and 
fewer feathers, and were in general less bulky." This author 
had evidently laboured under a mistake, in supposing these 
were the nests of the sparrow. I have, during 1831, had an 
opportunity of inspecting two nests belonging to a small co- 



Birds, 4:6^ 

lony of swifts (for I find that they, like their congeners the 
martin (H. urbica) and sand martin {H. riparia), delight in 
associating together, whenever it is practicable), consisting of 
three pairs, these being all that visited this village last spring. 
They took up their quarters under the eaves of the roof of the 
church, all of them entering by the same aperture: this was 
too small to admit my hand ; and I was, in consequence, under 
the necessity of untiling a very large space before I succeeded 
in finding the nests. There were but two, which were placed 
in opposite directions from the entrance : one contained tJu^ee 
eggs of a clear white colour ; the other not any. I was much 
surprised to find these nests so totally different in their struc- 
ture from what I had hitherto been led to expect. Instead of 
being "loose and slovenly structures " (A. R. Y., V. 60.), I 
found them both (for they were precisely similar) quite the 
contrary ; being very neat and compact. They were chiefly 
composed of that part of the blade (the sheath) which is left 
adhering round the straw : this is a light substance, and there 
can scarcely be a doubt that it is obtained by the bird on the 
wing, as it is waved about by the wind ; the remainder was 
of dry grass, none of the pieces more than about 6 in. in 
length ; not any feathers whatever. These substances were 
very closely interwoven, and were held firmly together by an 
adhesive substance very much resembling glue, and so dis- 
posed round the inner edge of the nest as to hold the straws 
in their places; the whole forming quite a cup of an oval 
shape, of about 4 in. in length, not very deep. These facts 
will show, I think, that the swift is entitled to more merit 
than has hitherto been awarded to it. In fact, I think 
it scarcely possible for the sparrow to occupy those places 
that are generally selected by the swift, as the swifts go a con- 
siderable way up under the roofs before they reach their nests: 
those I have mentioned were, I should say, from 5 ft. to 6 ft. 
from the entrance ; nor could there be any thing like suffi- 
cient room for the sparrow to form their domc-hmit nest, which 
I believe they invariably form, even where there is a natural 
covering. I hope some correspondent, who may have oppor- 
tunities, will be induced to examine the nests of the swift, and 
let us know how far those of the little colony resident here last 
year agree with those of the main body. I suspect there will 
not be found any very great difference. — J. D. Salmon, Stoke 
Ferry, Noifolk, Dec. 28. 1833. 

Additional Particulars, communicated under Date ofThefford, 
Norfolk, July 14. 1834. — My observations have been fully 
verified. These birds are very numerous in this town [Thet- 
ford, Norfolk], and they made their first appearance this 



464 Short CommtiHicatioJis : — 

spring on April 26. Several pairs having taken up their 
residence at a house, entering under the eaves, I, on May 22., 
examined this situation, and found that there were seven nests, 
all of them containing eggs, two with a pair, four with three, 
and one with even four. The nests, in this case, instead of 
being some way up under the roof, were all placed upon the 
wall plate, although at some distance from the different en- 
trances under the tiles : they were precisely similar in form 
and structure to those previously described, the only difference 
being in the materials of which they were composed. As, 
however, they had been occupied for the same purpose the 
precedhig season, if not for a longer period, as was evident 
from their appearance, it was rather a difficult matter to ascer- 
tain precisely what the materials were. I should think prin- 
cipally feathers and other light substances. I took the 
precaution of removing every nest, and all rubbish ; and, as I 
perceived that the birds still adhered to the same place, I, on 
June 27-5 again examined the same situation, and found that 
the swifts had constructed eight other nests ; these, of course, 
having been built since my previous examination. These 
nests were, in form and structure, precisely similar to the 
others, except that there was in some a greater profusion of 
feathers, intermixed with a few straws and other light mate- 
rials, all held together firmly by a viscous substance : each 
contained only a pair of either young or eggs. On removing 
the tiles, several of the old birds would not leave their nests, 
although exposed to view, until gently taken off. The author 
of that interesting work, lately published, The Feathered 
Tribes, has remarked, in mentioning the different situations 
selected by this bird, its occupying " the jutting rocks that 
rise to a considerable altitude amid fertile places, and its in- 
stinct leads it to adapt the structure of its nest to the ele- 
ments. The straws and other matters of which it is composed 
are said to be soldered to the rock, and to each other, with a 
viscid substance, elaborated by glands for the express purpose, 
though, perhaps, the same glutinous matter may more assist 
the bird in the capture of its prey." I think I may now with 
certainty state that the swift does not make use of the deserted 
nest of the sparrow, except as a foundation on which to place 
its own nest, the same as it would upon any other substance. 
The swift is remarkable for its early rising and retiring late 
to rest, and may be seen for a considerable time in the even- 
ing after all the other iifirundines have retired, and even 
seeming to dispute the acquisition of flies, &c., with the bats, 
whose flapping movements are strangely contrasted with the 
swift's rapid and silent evolutions ; for at these times it is

quite silent, being eager and intent upon securing its prey, as 
it passes and repasses with the utmost velocity, and at the 
same time flying much lower than it is wont at midday to do.

[Both nests are neat ones. No. 1. seems as if it has been 
much used: the feathers about its interior surface are not 
numerous, and have a trodden battered appearance : it is re- 
markable that a twig, the thickness of the tine of an eating- 
fork, as tough as wire, passes at the bottom of this nest across 
its longer axis. No. 2. is a nest much thicker in its walls, 
which are interiorly coated with many feathers, several of 
which retain their expanded form. The viscous matter, by 
which the materials are cemented together, is obvious in each 
of the nests. We have given them both to Mr. E. Blyth.]

A Pair of the Wryneck have steered their Nest to be removed 
and replaced Five Times, and Four Layings of Eggs to he taken 
away, before they isooidd quit the Place of attempted. Incubation. 
— I was wishing, last spring, to obtain the eggs of the wry- 
neck to place in my cabinet, and accordingly watched very 
closely a pair of this bird that had resorted to a garden in this 
village, for the purpose of incubation ; I soon ascertained that 
they had selected a hole in an old decayed apple tree for that 
purpose, the entrance to which was so small, as not to admit 
my hand. The tree being hollow and decayed at the bottom 
near the ground, I was enabled to reach the nest by putting 
my arm upwards ; and I found, on withdrawing the nest, that 
the underneath part of it was composed of moss, hair, &c., 
having every appearance of an old one of the redstart's of the 
preceding summer ; which, I suspect, was the case : the upper 
part was made of dried roots. The nest did not contain any 
eggs, and I returned it by stuffing it up in the inside of the 
tree. On passing by the same tree, about a week afterwards, 
my attention was arrested by observing one of the birds leav- 
ing the hole, upon which I gently withdrew the nest, and 
was much gratified at finding it contained five most beautiful 
glossy eggs, the shells of which were perfectly white, and so 
transparent diat the yolks shone through, giving them a deli- 
cate pink colour, but which is lost in the blowing. [This is 
the case with the Ggg of the kingfisher.] I replaced the nest, 
and visited it during the ensuing week, and was induced, out

of curiosity, to examine it again, when, to my astonishment, I 
found the bird had not deserted the hole, she having laid six 
eggs since : I took these away, and was obliged to keep them, 
as I was only able to replace the nest by thrusting it up in 
the inside of the tree as before, which I did. I again visited 
the spot in the following week, and found that they had still 
pertinaciously adhered to their domicile, having farther laid 
four more eggs. I repeated the experiment, but, not having 
an opportunity of visiting the tree until ten days afterwards, I 
thought at the time that the nest was abandoned, and was not 
undeceived until I had again withdrawn the nest, having taken 
the precaution of endeavouring to frighten the old bird off, 
should she be on the nest, which I found was the case, she 
suffering me to pull the nest to the bottom of the tree, before 
she attempted to escape : there were seven eggs, which were 
slightly sat upon. What appears to me extraordinary is, 
that the bird should suffer her nest to be disturbed Jive times, 
and the eggs (amounting altogether to twenty-two) to be taken 
away at four different periods within the month, before she 
finally abandoned the spot she had selected. After this the 
pair quitted the garden, seeking, I presume, and, I trust, find- 
ing, some more fortunate spot in which to rear their young. —

[This is the case referred to in p. 338. Mr. Blyth has 
given, in the Field Naturalist's Magazine for January, 1834, 
ii. 50, 51., various facts on the habits of the wryneck. Ac- 
cording to his experience, " it forms no nest, but lays its eggs 
on the soft sawdust-like chips at the bottom of the hole."] 

The Habits of the Wheatear (MotacillaCEndnthe.)—" One 
most probable reason for the solitary habits of the wheatear is 
the nature of its food ; for, living, as it seems to do, on the 
few insects which frequent such places as the little heaps of 
stones collected from the ridges of a corn field, it would be 
impossible for more than a pair of these birds to find subsist- 
ence near one spot. The gregarious habits, again, of other 
birds which feed on insects, depend on similar habits in the 
peculiar insects to which they are partial," The observation 
here given, I have found quoted from " Timers lelescope^' for 
1832; of which year the natural history is ascribed [V. 186.] 
to Professor Rennie ; and it affords a proof of the necessity 
of more extended enquiries, before we can venture to speak 
with certainty of the natural habits of even the common birds 
of our own country. The only specimens of this bird that are 
ever found in corn fields, in Cornwall, are such as are not our 
own residents, but which are engaged in travelling, with all 
haste, to their summer homes. The time of this their spring 



Birds, Spiders, 467 

migration is, therefore, confined to the month of March ; after 
which they are seen only on the slopes of our hills fronting 
the sea, which, being only sheepwalks, afford abundance of 
wild thyme, and other plants that are supposed to attract the 
insects on which the wheatear feeds. The only other situ- 
ation in which, 1 believe, I have seen a resident wheatear, is on 
the wild downs close to Dozmerry Pool, in the middle of the 
county of Cornwall. The periods of this bird's first arrival 
are here given : — March 1 7. 1 8 1 7 ; March 1 8. 1 8 1 6 and 1 822 ; 
March 20. 1818. My subsequent notes showed so little vari- 
ation in the periods, that I have since ceased to mark them. 
The wheatear reaches our shores so early in the morning as 
to prove that it must have taken flight from the French coast 
long before daybreak. Few come after nine o'clock in the 
morning, and none after twelve. They sometimes perch on 
our fishing-boats, at two or three leagues from land, in au 
almost exhausted state. They do not cross the Channel every 
day; and, as it usually happens that our own residents are 
not the first to arrive, it is common for them to abound in a 
morning; but in the afternoon, and for a day or two after, 
for not one to be seen. My own observations do not confirm 
the remark, that one sex materially precedes the other ; they 
rather appear to arrive indiscriminately. Through the sum- 
mer, the wheatear is a common bird along our coasts, on the 
slopes fronting the sea, somewhat above the bare uncovered 
rocks. On the least alarm they flit over the precipice, and 
take refuge in some place of shelter. The nest is not often 
seen ; but our prying fisher-boys inform me that it is concealed 
in the bottom of a deep recess, beneath some huge stone or 
rock, far beyond the reach of their arms. Consequently 
when discovered, a circumstance of some difiiculty, they are 
able to obtain it only by means of a hook fastened to the end 
of a rod. This bird has a slight, but not unpleasing, song. 
It is vulgarly known by the name of nacker. — J, CoucJi*

468 Short Communications : — 

Insects. — The Death-Ksoatch. — Sir, I enclose you a spe- 
cimen of one, and beg to preface the circumstances 1 ob- 
served respecting il by two short extracts on the systematic 
names for the species of death-watch. 

" Authors formerly were not agreed concerning the insect 
called the death-watch ; some attributing it to a kind of wood- 
louse, others to a spider. But it is a received opinion now, 
adopted upon satisfactory evidence, that it is produced by 
some little beetles, belonging to the timber-boring genus, 
Anobium Fahncius.^^ [Kirhy and Spence^ Letter 24-.) 

" One of the insects which produce the ticking termed the 
death-watch, is a woodlouse (Termes pulsatorius Lin., 
A'tropos lignarius Leach), It is not so large as the common 
louse, but whiter and more slender, having a red mouth and 
yellow eyes. It lives in old books, the paper on walls, col- 
lections of insects, and dried plants The ticking noise 

is made by the insect beating against the wood with its head. 
.... Another death-watch is a small beetle (Anobium tessel- 
latum)." (^Insect Architecture, p. 304.) 

As naturalists are not yet agreed respecting the insect, or 
insects, popularly called the death-watch, I enclose you one, 
which, you will perceive, is a small brown beetle, three-tenths 
of an inch long, having its elj^tra, or two wing-covers, 
uniformly fluted or furrowed in the direction of their length. 
It appears to be the Anobium striatum of the Fabrician 
system, and one of those insects which bore their galleries, 
like pinholes, in old wood. Its history, as far as I am 
acquainted with it, is as follows : — On the 28th of July last 
[1831], at midnight, having entered my bedroom in this town, 
and laid down my watch, I heard a noise as of the ticking of 
another watch. The noise proceeded from within or under a 
half sheet of brown paper, in which mould candles had been 
wrapped. The paper lay loosely rolled up on the chimney 
piece. I placed my ear close to the paper while the insect 
was ticking, and although my watch was at the same time 
beating loudly at the distance of only two feet, I could not 
distinguish any kind of difference in the ticking of the insect 
from that of the watch. Occasionally, while the insect was 
ticking, its ticking would suddenly change into a louder, less 
acute, and less frequent sound than that of the watch. This 
latter sound, however, did not continue above twenty or thirty 
beats at a time, whereas the ticking in unison with the watch 
would continue without intermission for some minutes. With 
the exception of a few intervals (and those short ones), 
the little beetle continued its noise all the time the candle 
• remained burning, which was about a quarter of an hour. As 



Insects, 469 

1 had never seen a death-watch, I was anxious to secure this ; 
but, fearful that it might escape me by candlehght, I deferred 
my search until morning. The light being extinguished, I 
still heard the insect imitating and keeping time with the 
watch, the beating of which it probably mistook for the call 
of its mate. The next morning, after sunrise, I again heard 
my little visiter mimicking the sound of my watch, the voice 
proceeding from the same spot as before. I now slowly and 
carefully unrolled the paper, and lifted it from the chimney- 
piece, minutely examining every part of it; but I found 
nothing whatever therein. I then examined that part of the 
chimney-piece on which the paper had rested, and there I 
perceived the enclosed beetle lying on its side, apparently 
dead. The chimney-piece, which was painted white, was 
quite clean, and, having carefully examined it, I can state 
that nothing in the shape of a living creature except this 
insect, was on the chimney-piece ; but whether it fell from the 
paper as I was carefully unrolling it, or whether it was before 
on the chimney-piece, I do not know. The wooden chimney- 
piece was not pierced by any insect. I have said that the 
beetle lay apparently dead. Those who are acquainted with 
this genus (Anobium) of coleopterous insects are aware of the 
pertinacity or fortitude with which some of the species simulate 
death to deceive their enemies: and I might, no doubt, have torn 
this individual limb from limb, or roasted it alive, before it 
would have betrayed any sign of life. That the insect was 
not however actually dead, was afterwards evident from my 
finding it, during the same day, on the top of a paper box, at 
the bottom of which I had placed it for future examination. 

That the enclosed insect produced the two different kinds of 
ticJdng which I heard, there can be therefore no question ; but 
whether it produced those sounds by striking on the paper, 
or by striking on the chimney-piece, or by any other means, 
I am not prepared to say. Possibly the deeper, louder, and 
less frequent beating which I heard was produced by striking 
against the chimney-piece, while the other was produced by 
striking on the paper. In the PhitosopJncal Transactions, 
No. 245. p. 376. and No. 271. p. 832. are descriptions of 
death-watches by Mr. Allen and Mr. Derham ; but neither 
there, nor elsewhere, have I met with any account of a death- 
watch similar to that which I have now given. Yours, &c.

[Our correspondent's insect came to us in a crushed state; 
but still its len«ith, and the lon^ritudinal furrows of its win<r- 
covers, were readily observable, and were as stated in his 
description. Mr. Westwood, to whom the specimen has 



470 Short Communications : — 

been submitted, has little doubt that the insect is Anobium 
striatum, or the nearly allied species A. nitidum of Herbst., 
{Step/i. III. M. iii. 340.) Of the Anobium tessellatum Fabr.^ 
and Termes pulsatorius Li?!., both alluded to above, a fuller, 
and of the Termes a very interesting, account, will be found 
in our II. 461. Mr. Westwood, besides communicating the 
name of our correspondent's insect, has favoured us with the 
following remarks on death-watches generally.] 

As to the identity of the death-watch, it is to be observed, 
that more than one insect is thus designated : the name, in 
fact, being a generic rather than a specific one ; any unusual 
ticking being called the death-w^atch. The noise, however, 
made by the A'tropos lignarius is not near so loud as that of 
the Anobium. One species of this genus, A. striatum, bores 
into the painted wooden chimney-board of my study. The 
perfect insects appear, in the hottest part of the summer, flying 
about the room in search of their mates ; but for many weeks 
previous to the appearance of the beetles, I hear the ticking 
in the interior of the chimney- board ; and as it is most pro- 
bable that these insects lie but a very short time in the pupa 
state, I cannot help thinking that this noise is caused by the 
larva in gnawing the wood with its powerful jaw^s. The 
females, after impregnation, must deposit their eggs either by 
boring into the wood with their ovipositor, or they probably 
creep into some of the old holes made on their exclusion, and 
so get into the wood without any trouble. 

P. S. A confirmation of my supposition occurs whilst I am 
writing (Oct. 13.), as I hear the ticking in the chimney-board 
precisely similar to what I heard some months ago, although 
it is some weeks since I saw a beetle ; so that, as there has 
been sufficient time for the eggs deposited by the females to 
be hatched, and for the grubs to acquire a moderate size, I 
have little hesitation in laying it to the latter. — J. O. West- 
wood. The Grove, Hammey-smith. 

Addenda to my former Note about the Ticking of Anobium. — 
In corroboration of my opinion that the ticking of the death- 
watch is occasionally caused by the gnawing of the wood by 
the larvce, I may mention that I have continued to hear the 
noise in the wood of my chimney-board up to the middle of 
November. I find, moreover, that the celebrated French 
entomologist, Olivier (in opposition to Geoffroy, who sup- 
posed the noise was caused by the perfect beetle knocking a 
dwelling-place for itself in the wood with its jaws), conjectured 
that the larvae were the cause of the noise : he, however, 
thought it was produced by the blows of the larvae in the 
interior of the wood for the purpose of ascertaining the thick-

ness of the barrier through which the insect, when arrived at 
the perfect state, would have to make its way ; its jaws, in that 
state, not being so strong as in the Jarva state. — Id. Dec. 7. 
1832. 

Feb. 21. 1833. I have, within a few days, again heard the 
ticking of the Anobia in my chimney-board. — Id. 

March 12. I have heard the ticking repeated in my 
chimney-board both, during February and the present month : 
it is, however, only at distant intervals that I hear the noise. 
Your correspondent, R. Edmonds, jun., has shown that the 
statements of Swammerdam, Derham, Latreille, &c., that the 
perfect Anobium ticks, are correct, whilst my own observ- 
ations, strengthened by those of Olivier (which I have men- 
tioned in my note of Dec. 7.), as well as by Swift's lines, — 

" A wood luorm 

That lies in old wood," 

" If the maggot cries click when it scratches the post," 

seem to establish that the larva is the cause of at least some 
of these portentous sounds. 

I may add, as bearing upon the question, that I have, at the 
present time a larva of Anobium tessellatum, which I have 
been endeavouring to rear for the last three years, — Id. 

March 14. My friend, Alexander Greisbach, Esq., informs 
me thcithe distinctly saw the large Anobium tessellatum, whilst 
standing upon an old rotten oak tree in Windsor Forest, throw 
back its head and the front part of its body, resting at the 
time upon the hind pair of legs, and then suddenly jerk its 
head upon the surface of the wood upon which it was standing, 
and produce a sharp sound. [See also Vol. II. p. 461.] 

May 22. The insect in my chimney-board has kept up his 
noise without any change of place, during the last and present 
months, together with another in my window frame ; and, 
since the hot weather set in, the noise has been much more 
continuous, as though the larva had arrived at a larger and 
stronger size : even whilst I write this, the noise is going on, 
and I cannot compare it to anything more apt than tlie sound 
caused by scratching the lid of a small chip box with die point 
of a pen. I have not yet seen a perfect Anobium. — Id. 

Nov. 18. The ticking in my fireboard has been continued 
in precisely the same spot through the whole of the summer 
and autumn, and long after the perfect Anobia had made their 
appearance. This the more confirms my idea of this noise 
being caused by the larva, which remains several years in that 
state. Had it been caused by the imago, it would not have 
been heard at the same spot for so many months. Whilst 
writing tliis, the noise is continued in the same spot. — Id.

These mentions of Anobium striatum have led me to re- 
member the fact of the insect's prevailing in the woodwork 
of my father's cottage, and to request from him specimens 
of the insect, and a description of any facts on its habits 
with which he might be acquainted. He has replied as 
follows: — '^ Nov. 9. 1832. Notwithstanding the terrible 
havoc made in the deal boards of the chamber floor and 
partitioning of my back room by the insect, I have had to 
search a long time to find for you, at this season, a single 
specimen in the winged state. I have found one, dead, and 
send it to you, along with many live larvae, packed in the dust 
from the old wood, which I have sawed and broken up to 
procure them. They are destructive vermin ; and, although 
small, will, by their aggregate exertion, shortly destroy the 
timber of any building, when the wood has become in a 
proper state for them to prey upon. Frequent washing and 
scouring of the floors, particularly at the time the insects are 
about to deposit their eggs; and painting or limewashing the 
partitions, doors, beams, and other objects of their attack, not 
readily scourable, appear to me to be the best preventives. 
Besides deal, they attack the wood of ash or elm; and my 
neighbour, Mr. Cooper, the wheelwright, says no kind of 
wood comes amiss to them. 

" I have visited Mr. Cooper's timber yard, to endeavour to 
obtain you specimens thence also ; and he has gouged out of 
a piece of wood of white deal one specimen, which you will 
find sticking dead, with its head outwards, though not pro- 
jecting, in the mouth of the hole it had drilled." 

I have submitted the two specimens mentioned to Mr, 
Westwood, who has confirmed my application of the name 
Anobium striatum to that from my father's cottage, and de- 
termined that taken from the wood of white deal, in Mr. 
Cooper's timber yard, to be the Ptilinus pectinicornis of Fa- 
bricius. The circumstance of this insect not being distinguished 
from the Anobium striatum, by my father or Mr. Cooper, 
gives ground for this question : may not the imputation above, 
on Anobium striatum, that, " besides deal, it attacks the wood 
of ash, elm, and no kind of wood comes amiss to it," belong in 
part to other insects of the Ptinidae family ? It is probable that 
to some one species of this same family the following allega- 
tion, by the poet Cowper, is referable. In the first book of 27ie 
Task, in the historical deduction of seats, it is said : — 
" And such [a stool] in ancient halls and mansions drear 
May still be seen, but perforated sore, 
And drilled in holes, the solid oak is found, 
33y worms voracious eating through and through." 



Insects, 473 

On April 16. 1833, I happened to be at my father's, and 
the above-mentioned Mr. Cooper was then removing a beechen 
bedstead from the vicar's house, which he, Mr. Cooper, had, not 
more than two or three (but I am pretty sure he said two) years 
before made and put up. It was, on April 16. 1833, a mere 
mass of powder, pierced through and through, with countless 
larvae in various places, although in others less so ; a difference 
which Mr. Cooper attributed to the wood having been taken 
from trees various in age, or from the centre and circumference 
of the same tree, &c. : however, the parts least attacked were 
somewhat so, and other parts so completely destroyed, that 
the whole bedstead was fit only for the fire. In passing my 
door he broke off, and gave me, a small cubical block, almost 
a lump of powder, and this I, after my return, sent to Mr. 
Westwood, who, as soon as the insect had become winged and 
had come forth, sent it back to me, with Ptilinus pectinicornis 
as the name for the insect. The aptness of its specific name 
was evident enough on May 25., when, the weather warm, 
some were flying about in apparent high joy, with the lamellae 
of their antennas as obvious as the teeth of a comb. This fact 
shows that beech is one of the kinds of wood ravaged (or 
eaten, as the Ptilinus itself would doubtless term it) in addi- 
tion to the white deal, in which it had been previously, as 
stated above, found in Mr. Cooper's timber-yard. 

My own first acquaintance with the habits of the Ptinidas 
began thus : — Some six or eight years ago, some tallies, that 
had been employed to bear the names of plants in a garden, 
were cut over to remove decayed parts, and fit them again to 
receive paint, and inscription, that they might be a second 
time employed. These tallies had been made out of old 
coach spokes, and one of them, the wood of which, I remember, 
was oak, (whatever that of coach spokes generally may be), 
had tracks eaten in it by larvae, some of which were then in 
it : this was saved, at some time in the winter, and observed 
until the perfect insects had come forth, which they did some 
time in the summer following. I ascertained their name at the 
time, which, I think, was Anobium striatum. — J. D.

— Happening lately to hear the observation made, that, " in 
all probability, the pale varieties (C. Helict- Fliibner?) of 
Colias Ediisrt will yet prove to be a distinct species," I am 
induced to offer a few remarks which I made on this insect 
in the Island of Jersey, where in particular situations, especially 
over the fields of lucern (Medicago sativa) by the sea side, I 
found it exceedingly abundant. 

It is a remarkable fact that all these pale varieties are 



4-74' Short Communications : — 

females. Of many hundreds of males, which I have seen in 
the course of a single day's ramble, I have never observed 
one variety of this sex, though I made it a point to capture 
every pale specimen which I saw. Where this insect flies in 
great abundance, the females are seldom seen, but where it is 
comparatively rare, the latter may as frequently be noticed 
on the wing as the males ; precisely as in the common P. carda- 
mines : I have seen the woods quite alive with the male orange- 
tipped white butterflies, when I have not observed above two or 
three females in the course of the day ; yet, where this species 
is not very abundant, both males and females may be seen 
flying about in nearly equal numbers; which fact will, indeed, 
reconcile some rather conflicting descriptions of this latter 
insect. In Jersey, the number of pale females of CoHa5 
Edusa bore the proportion, to those of the usual colour, of at 
least one third ; but, though the males were so very plentiful, 
female specimens were diflicult to procure, as they slug- 
gishly concealed themselves in the lucern : I was never able 
to take above half a dozen in a day, though of males I might 
have captured some hundreds. Yet, in September, 1833, the 
two sexes were observed in this neighbourhood [Tooting, 
Surrey], flying in about equal numbers ; but the species was, 
here, far from being common. 

I took, on the whole, about twenty individuals of the pale 
variety of Colias Edus«, and observed in them considerable 
variation ; some being whiter than others, and some having 
the spot on the upper surface of the hinder wings white, 
others having it yellowish, and others orange : they also 
varied much in size, but not more than individuals of the 
usual colour do. 

It will not, perhaps, be uninteresting to name here a few 
other species which I observed in that island, during a stay 
of three months, in August, September, and October, 1833. 
I saw there no sort of butterfly that was not common in 
Britain. The other European species of C61ia5 I sought for 
much, but in vain. 

Hipparchi« JEgevia swarmed in unusual abundance, far be- 
yond what I had ever seen in England; the numerous shady 
lanes there being peculiarly adapted to its habits. H. MegaeV« 
was also extremely plentiful; it was unusually common in the 
vicinity of London that season. H. pilosellae and Pamphilu5 
were there as abundant as here ; as were the different autumnal 
P6nti<^. Lycae^n« Phlae^a^ was very plentiful, also Polyom- 
matus Alexis; this last mostly retiring to roost in small 
clusters, chiefly on the sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), or 
on rushes ; a habit which may be observed in several of our 



Insects. 475 

British Polyommati, and which furnishes the best mode of 
procuring unrubbed specimens of them, where they occur in 
sufficient abundance. I noticed P. Argiohi^, which was rare, 
but no other member of this genus. Cynthi« cardui was 
rather common; Vanessa urticse exceedingly so; V. To some- 
what rare ; V. Atahinta very abundant ; and I witnessed there 
a very large concourse of this last-mentioned butterfly, and 
of common wasps (Fespa vulgaris), upon the trunk of a dis- 
eased pollard oak, from which exuded a saccharine juice. A 
similar occurrence has been noticed by Mr. Lukis of the 
neighbouring island of Guernsey. (VI. 222. [see also VII. 
265.]) In the instance now mentioned, one side of the tree 
was completely covered with alderman butterflies; these are 
always readily attracted by any thing sweet. 

I heard several times there of a large and very showy blue 
butterfly, which I have not since been able to make out. It 
decidedly was not the emperor ( Apatura Vns) : although it 
w^as about when I was in the island, I did not once succeed 
in getting a sight of it. 

A very common insect there is the humming-bird hawk- 
moth (Macroglossa stellatarum), one of the most interesting 
of our native Lepidoptera. I have seen as many as seven or 
eight of them together, hovering around the flowers of a 
honeysuckle, w^hisking from bloom to bloom with the rapidity 
of thought, suspending themselves in the air around each 
blossom, and inserting into the tubes their long proboscides, 
then quick as lightning darting out of sight ; though sombre 
in their hues, reminding us of the fairy tenants of the western 
world. One that I reared from the caterpillar came out in 
the short space of four weeks. I observed a favourite resting- 
place of this species to be immediately under a small projec- 
tion, over the sea beach, formed by the action of high tides 
against a crumbling sandy soil, the matted roots of the turf 
holding together, while the ground beneath had been washed 
away. In this situation I have seen within a very short space 
four or five of the M. stellatarum, which would readily suffer 
themselves to be transfixed, and this in midday, when others 
were flying about in abundance. To this place I have often 
seen them fly direct, and, after hovering a little, alight to rest 
themselves. 

It would here take too much space to note down the various 
moths, &c., which I observed. I found the larva of the 
^phinjc A'tropo5, but I failed in the endeavour to rear it. 
The angle shades moth (Phlogophora) was uncommonly plen- 
tiful, as was also the common Pliisia gamma, the latter flying

A work of dignified purpose, as is shown in its title ; and 
this the author has striven to execute in what he has con- 
ceived to be a consistent manner, namely, a vigorous and 
lofty one. We honour his purpose ; we applaud his efforts, 
that is, his facts, his arguments, his illustrations, his eloquence 
in many places, adduced in the elucidation, relevance, and 
production of this purpose; but we do not quite agree with 
him in the manner in which many of these are presented, nor 
in all the conclusions to which he has directed them. In the 
former there is not enough, to our liking, of the suaviter in 
modo ; in the latter, quite enough o^ the Jbr titer in re ; the re, 
in this case, we employ to signify the SiMihofs foregone con- 
clusions. 

The work should, however, be possessed by every natu- 
ralist : it includes a very rich collection of scientific facts ; 
many instructive ones derived from comparative anatomy.

The extraordinary remains of enormous animals, nearly 
allied to the lizard and crocodile, that occur in the secondary 
strata of England, above the coal measures, may be regarded 
as the peculiar treasures of English fossil geology ; as these 
remains occur more abundantly, and in better preservation, 
in England than in any other country hitherto examined. It 
was in this country, also, that the true character of the animals 
to which these fossil remains belong was first ascertained. 
The beds of dark stratified limestone intermixed with strata 
of dark clay, called lias limestone and clay, which extend into

many of the midland counties, from Dorsetshire to Yorkshire, 
are peculiarly rich in these fossil remains; in some parts the 
animals appear to have perished by a sudden catastrophe, 
which has broken the bones into numberless fragments, and 
scattered them through particular strata, as in the cliffs at 
Aust Passage, near Bristol ; in other situations, the remains 
of nearly entire skeletons have been found, which are evidently 
near the situations in which the animals expired. The bones 
are commonly so closely embedded in the stone, that the dif- 
ficulty of preserving them entire is often very great, added 
to which, the quarrymen frequently destroy large portions of 
the skeleton, before they are aware of its occurrence : the 
vast size of some of these animals is such, " extending many 
a fathom," that the head may be found in one part of the 
quarry, while the remote extremities may be buried in another 
part which may not be wanted for some years to come. Owing 
to these difficulties it is, that good specimens of entire skele- 
tons or even of large portions of them, are so rare in collec- 
tions at present. Mr. Hawkins, the author of this work, has 
for some years distinguished himself as a " mighty hunter," 
a fossil Nimrod. Unlike, however, to the heroes and hunters 
of the fabulous ages, whose labours were directed to the de- 
struction of monsters, our modern Nimrod is engaged in 
restoring their dislocated limbs, and joining heads to their 
cervical vertebrae again, after having lain dissevered for 
countless ages. The present volume contains an ample ac- 
count of the difficulties which Mr. Hawkins has had to en- 
counter among the quarries and quarrymen in the county of 
Somerset, near Wells and Glastonbury, where his discoveries 
have been chiefly made. Many persons may deem the con- 
versations with the quarrymen, given in the Somersetshire 
dialect, more amusing than instructive, and altogether mis- 
placed in a work on science. The author himself confesses 
that he has, for his own pleasure, departed occasionally from 
the conventional forms of writing, but we would willingly 
pardon him on this head, for the very valuable service which 
he has rendered to the student of fossil geology. 

The lithographic plates in the present volume are of large 
size, and well executed, and display with much clearness 
the osteology of the several species of fossil Ichthyosauri and 
Plesiosauri in the author's possession ; indeed, they convey 
almost as distinct information as we could obtain from the 
specimens themselves. The anatomical details given in the 
description of the plates are good as far as they extend, but 
we could have wished them to have been more ample. The 
drawing in plate 3. represents an entire skeleton of the Ichthyo- 



478 Hawkins's Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri. 

saurus (called by the author cliiroligostinns), except the 
right fore arm and paddle ; the figure measures in the plate 
3 ft. 3 in. from the snout to the extremity of the tail : there 
are in this skeleton about 500 bones, and the spinal column 
contains 150 vertebra. Plates 7. and 17. contain figures of 
skeletons of two other species, nearly as perfect as that in 
plate 3., but of smaller dimensions. Plate 24. represents a 
very interesting skeleton of the Plesiosaurus, entire except 
one of the paddles : in this skeleton the bones of the sternum 
and pelvis are beautifully displayed ; there are thirty-two cer- 
vical vertebrae, and twenty dorsal ; the neck of this animal 
was longer than the whole body, except the tail; the caudal 
vertebrae amount to thirty-three. Several of the other plates 
represent large portions of skeletons. The remaining plates 
display detached bones and heads, with the paddles or hands 
of these animals. The head represented in plate 13. is truly 
remarkable for the extreme length of the jaws ; it resembles, 
as the author observes, the head and bill of a snipe. " It 
possesses 260 long sharp teeth, 140 in the upper jaw, and 120 
in the lower jaw." 

The author has given a new^ classification of the species of 
both the Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri, but we cannot think that 
he has been happy in his nomenclature, though derived from 
the Greek ; it would scarely be possible to select terms that 
are less suited to the English ear. The classification of Ich- 
thyosauri, which he proposes, is founded on the structure of 
the hand or paddle. From the Greek cheir, hand, and osteon, 
bone, with the addition of the Greek words for, 1. few, 2. many, 
3. round, 4. oblong ; we have the following names for the 
four species; — Sp. 1. Ichthyosaurus chiroligostinus ; 2. chiro- 
polyostinus; 3. chirostrongulostinus ; 4. chiroparamekosti- 

nus ! ! ! ! 

The specific characters of the Plesiosauri, he says, are to 
be discovered " in the posterior extremity, in the tarsus." 
Then, from the Greek tarsos, heel, and osteon, bone, with the 
Greek numerals for 3, 4, 5, 6, we have the following strange 
names: — Sp. 1. Plesiosaurus triatarsostinus ; 2. tesseratarsos- 
tinus ; 3. pentetarsostinus ; 4. extarsostinus. 

We could almost suppose that our author intended, by the 
invention of these terms, to ridicule the absurd fabrication of 
compound Greek words, such as " pliocene," " pecillite," 
&c. &c., which have lately been introduced by some geologists ; 
for he cannot expect that the names he has constructed will 
ever be used by his countrymen. We sincerely hope that 
o-ood sense will ere long free geology from all such pedantic 
contamination. In the mean time, we recommend our author 



Literary Notices. 479 

to confine »his terms to the exclusive use of the Somersetshire 
quarrymen, as we have Uttle doubt the pronunciation of them 
would become more mellifluous by an admixture with the 
euphonic tones of the western dialect. 

Whatever may be the minor faults of the present volume, 
the plates alone, with the descriptions of them, possess such 
value as to entitle it to a place in every public library and 
institution where science is respected ; and we are fully per- 
suaded that a correct translation of the anatomical details, in 
the French language, published with the plates, would be 
favourably received on the Continent. — B.

Art. I. Thoughts on the Questio7i, Why cannot Animals speak 
the Language of Man ? By J. J. 

A QUERY to this purport is given in I. 299., and I have not 
observed a reply to it in any subsequent volume. In order to 
state the several points of the question fully and explicitly, it 
may be proper to repeat the words of the querist. " Why," 
he observes, " beasts do not speak the language of man, is 
not the question I vrould propose ; but why (as is evident) 
they cannot? Whether it is owing, to use a musical phrase, 
to their want of ear ; whether, to use a philosophical one, it 
results from their want of understanding ; or whether, as I 
am apt to think, it arises from the want of a proper conform- 
ation of the organs most necessary in speaking ? " 

It appears to me, from the mode in which this interrogatory 
is expressed, that the writer is of the class of thinkers who 
deny to all animals the possession of attributes, or faculties, 
with which many of them are unquestionably endowed. It 
might be easily proved that the higher orders of the animal 
kingdom possess, and some of them in an eminent degree, 
faculties which they are here said to " want." " Want of 
ear " is an expression vague and obscure enough when applied 
to animals ; but if it mean, as I presume it does, the want of 
a capability of distinguishing variations, or differences of sound, 
it is manifestly false in its application to animals. Were all 
animals unable to distinguish the difference between one sound 
and another, how could they ever be taught to comprehend 
the meanings of various articulate sounds? to understand, 
partially, the language of man ? How could they be subjected 
to the purposes of domestication ? and of what use, indeed, 
would their ears be to them ? How could a dog know his

name, and be taught to go or come at the command of his 
master ? a horse to proceed forwards or turn backwards, to 
turn to the right or left, at a single word of his driver ? 

" Want of understanding " must mean want of reason. 
It has been asserted, and repeated, thousands of times, that 
reason is the exclusive prerogative of man ; that man is the 
only rational creature. But how has this ever been proved ? 
Assuredly not by facts. I have no inclination to discuss the 
question, which has already been treated on at great length, 
and with much candour and ability, in Griffiths's edition of 
Cwvier's Animal Kingdom, iii. 360. et seq. ; and I shall merely 
instance one quality, which, wheresoever it is found, whether 
in a man or a goose, appears to me to be undeniably demon- 
strative of the existence of the reasoning principle, and that 
is, the capability of receiving instruction, or of forming cer- 
tain conclusions from previous experience. We recognise 
this qualit}^, in a greater or less degree, throughout the 
higher orders of animals ; and, view it as we will, we can 
conclude it to be the effect of nothing else than reason : and 
it is utterly inconsistent with the acknowledged properties of 
instinct. It is a combined result of memory and judgment ; 
faculties which no one has ever said are not essentially rational, 
and which are principally effective in rendering the human 
intellect what it actually is. In short, we cannot deny to 
animals the possession of that mysterious something which 
we call mind ; of a mind similar to ours in kind, although 
infinitely inferior to ours in degree. 

But to leave this digression, and attempt a direct reply to 
the question at the head of this article. For this purpose, I 
cannot do better than quote the observations of Mr. Lawrence 
(in his Lectures on Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural His- 
tory of Man) on the subject : — " Man," says he, " exhibits, 
by external signs, what passes within him ; he communicates 
his sentiments by words : and this sign is universal. The 
savage and the civilised man have the same power of utter- 
ance : both speak, naturally, and are equally understood. It 
is not owing, as some have imagined, to any defect in their 
organs that animals are denied the faculty of speech. The 
tongue of a monkey is as perfect as that of a man ; yet mon- 
keys cannot speak. Several animals may be taught to pro- 
nounce words, and even to repeat sentences ; which proves 
clearly that the want of speech is not owing to any defect in 
their organs. But to make them conceive the ideas which 
these words express is beyond the power of art : they arti- 
culate and repeat like an echo or machine. Language implies 
a train of thinking ; and, for this reason, brute animals are 



On Birds alluring Intruders Jrom their Nest. 483 

incapable of speech : for, though their external senses are 
not inferior to our own, and though we should allow some of 
them to possess a dawning of comparison, reflection, and 
judgment, it is certain that they are unable to form that asso- 
ciation of ideas in which alone the essence of thought consists."

Art. II. Facts and Arguments in relation to the Two Questions, 
Are all Birds in the Habit of alluring Intruders Jrom their Nest? 
andy Why do Birds sing ? By C. Conway, Esq. 

Are all Birds in the Habit of alluring Intruders from their 
Nests P — The lapwing will fly round and round, tumbling and 
tossing in the air, and at the same time making the country 
resound with the echoes of its endless pee-wit, and thus lead 
the intruder farther and farther from its nest ; the grouse, if 
disturbed from her nest, will shuflSe through the heath in a 
very awkward manner, and will not take wing until she has 
proceeded a considerable distance. [The partridge will do 
the same.] I once found a skylark do the same. Having 
been informed of the nest, in a corn field, I proceeded thither 
to see the eggs, but, finding the bird on the nest, and having 
my butterfly net in my hand, I easily captured her. When 
I took the bird into my hand, she feigned death, and allowed 
herself to be handled for a considerable time, and that rather 
roughly, and when I threw her from me, in the expectation 
that she would take wing, she fell to the ground like a stone, 
and there she lay for me to push her about with my foot, 
until I at last thought that I had injured her in the capture, 
and that she was absolutely dead. Remaining quiet, however, 
for a very short period, the bird began moving, and, with one 
wing trailing along the ground, and shuflfling along as if one 
of her legs had been broken, she proceeded for a considerable 
distance, and then took wing. Is there not here an evident 
distinction shown between instinct and reason? Instinct 
taught the bird to lure all intruders from her nest, but she 
could not reason that, as I had already discovered her nest 
and captured her upon it, the lure was, in this instance, 
useless. But, the circumstance that led to these remarks is 
the following. In pursuing an azure blue butterfly, I was 
diverted from my object by the melodies of a nightingale 
almost close at my side. The singing was in one continuous, 
incessant, and uninterrupted melody; there were none of 

I I 2 



484? Cause of Singing in Birds. 

those frequent breaks, which are so characteristic of the song 
of the nightingale, when heard at a little distance ; it was one 
incessant warble. I can hardly call it a warble either ; it 
was an unceasing effort; so much so, that I stood perfectly 
astonished, and at a loss to conceive how it was possible for 
so small a creature to exert herself so mightily. I began, 
however, to think, that the nest of the melodist could not be 
far off'; and, as I had never yet seen the nest of the bird, I 
determined to watch her closely, in order to discover it. But, 
I was nearly giving up the search as useless ; for, as soon as I 
entered the copse, no matter at what part I made my en- 
trance, there was the nightingale close at my side, delighting 
me with her melody, and hopping from spray to spray, and 
from bush to bush, and thus leading me the round of the 
wood at her pleasure. When, however, all hope of finding 
the nest had nearly vanished, I fell in with it by pure accident, 
and I then discovered that the singing of the bird had always 
led me in a direction from the nest. The question with which 
I began, I would therefore again repeat — Are all birds in the 
habit of luring intruders from their nests ? 

Why do Birds sing P — As I have just been speaking of the 
nightingale, perhaps it is the most appropriate place for offer- 
ing a few remarks upon the song of birds : a subject, by the 
way, of some difficulty. The question. Why do birds sing? 
has never yet been, I think, satisfactorily answered. It was 
supposed that the male sang to soothe the female during in- 
cubation. (Pennant, quoted in Rennie's Montagu.) There 
was plausibility in this ; but then the question would imme- 
diately arise, Why are some birds denied song ? Do the females 
of some birds require soothing more than others ? Besides, 
birds sit during the night as well as the day, yet no bird but 
the nightingale sings during the night. The skylark frequently 
mounts so high that we not only lose sight of him, but we 
also lose all trace of his song : can the female then hear him 
and be soothed by his notes ? Barrington (quoted in Rennie's 
Montagu) supposed the female to be silent, " lest her song 
should discover her nest.'* A singular conclusion, certainly, 
at the same time that it was supposed that the male sang to 
soothe the female during the period of incubation. If the 
song were poured forth for this soothing purpose, it must of 
course have been in the near neighbourhood of the nest, and 
consequently would be as likely to discover the nest as if the 
female herself sang ; besides, do not the females of some birds 
sing occasionally, as well as the males ? Now comes another 
theory. " The males of song birds do not, in general, search 
for the females, but, on the contrary, their business in the 



Cause of Singing in Birds. 485 

spring is to perch upon some conspicuous spot, breathing out 
their full and natural notes, which, by instinct, the female 
knows, and repairs to the spot to choose her mate." {Mon- 
tagu,) The female amongst birds has evidently the advantage 
over the human species, for she is the chooser, and not the 
object of choice. The same author tells us, that " birds can- 
not discriminate the colours by which their species is known ;" 
and this is evidently put forth to account for the male " perch- 
ing upon some conspicuous spot." But what say others? 
The nightingale sings " concealed in the thickest part of a 
bush or small tree.'* [Field Nat. Mag,, i. 201.) Both state- 
ments are fact. The nightingale does sing in the concealment 
of a thick bush, and the song thrush sings, morning and even- 
ing, mounted on the highest spray he can find. I cannot 
suppose that he does this to lure the female to him, for I have 
never observed it to have that effect ; besides, he does it for 
a very considerable portion of spring and summer ; certainly 
after he is mated. Neither can I suppose that his song is 
poured forth for the purpose of soothing the female during 
the period of incubation ; for, if that were the case, the sooth- 
ing would be required as much by night as by day, and as 
much in the middle of the day as in the morning and the 
evening : besides all this, he frequently sings at Christmas, 
when he is neither mated nor seeking a mate. Let us come, 
however, to a still later opinion. " The songs of birds have 
given rise to several curious enquiries of no small interest. 
After investigating the subject with considerable attention for 
several years, we have come to the conclusion that the notes 
of birds, which we denominate singing, may all be referred to 
hilarity and joy, or to rivalry and defiance," (Rennie's Habits 
of Birds, 260.) In making this theory hold good, I think 
we shall find as many difficulties as in any other. Why is 
the nightingale more joyous than other birds during the night? 
Is the redbreast habitually more joyous than other birds ? for 
he sings nearly the whole year round. If it be joy that sti- 
mulates to song, why do not the females sing as well as the 
males : have they no joy ? And why are some birds altogether 
denied song : are they joyless ? The thrush breaks forth into 
song frequently in the winter, and the woodlark makes the 
December mornings resound with his song. How is it that 
these birds are so joyous when all others are gloomy ? The 
meadow pipit, again, when disturbed from her nest, will mount 
up into the air to a considerable height, and then descend 
slowly, warbling with all her powers, until she reaches the 
ground. Is it any source of joy to the bird to be thus dis- 
turbed from her nest? This may be said to be " defiance."

486 Imitative Powers of the Sedge Bird, 

To this I have only to reply, it is the usual and general note, 
and certainly a source of considerable pleasure to the rambler 
over our mountains, where they abound. But we must, I am 
fearful, conclude where we began : Why do birds sing ?

Art. III. A Notice of the Imitative Potuers of the British Mocking- 
Bird, or Sedge Bird {Salvia [Curruca] salicaria)^ additional to 
that in V. 653, 654. By T. G., of Clitheroe, Lancashire. 

I AM surprised that not any other correspondent has noticed 
the wonderful imitative powers of this bird. So far is my 
notice in V. 653, 654. (in that notice, "pelting notes," in 
p. 653, line 8. from the bottom, is a misprint for " fretting 
notes") from overrating this bird's imitative powers, that I 
have not enumerated above half the notes which it hits off 
with such wonderful exactness. 

In listening to one the other day for about a quarter of an 
hour, I heard it give three notes of the swallow, two of the 
martin, two of the spring wagtail ; and, in addition, notes of 
the sparrow, whinchat, starling, chaffinch, whitethroat, green- 
finch, little redpole, and whin linnet (i^ringilla Linota) ; be- 
sides the notes of half a dozen birds which I did not know ; 
at least a reasoning from analogy would induce me to think 
them imitations, and I have no right lo suppose that they 
were not, because I did not happen to recognise them. I was 
not strictly correct when I said (in V. 653.) that it only imi- 
tates the alarm notes (called here the fretting notes) of other 
birds ; for, although this is generally the case, it is not invari- 
ably so. For instance, in addition to producing the alarm 
note of the swallow, chiz-zee chiz-zee, it also had the whit whit 
which the swallow uses when flying about, and the chatter of 
self-satisfaction (not the song) which one often hears in a barn 
when two swallows are arranging their plan of operations in 
the spring. Again, in addition to the shriek of the martin, 
there was the note which it utters when on the wing, in pur- 
suit of its food. There was also the chirrup of the green- 
finch, and the whee whee whee which is the climax of the 
linnet's song, by which it is so irresistible as a call bird, and 
which appears to bring down the flock, in fact, in spite of 
themselves. 

Although the sedge bird imitated all I have mentioned, it 
made much more frequent use of the notes of some than of 
others : the sparrow, the whinchat, the swallow, and the star- 



SoJig of the Bramble Finch. 487 

ling appeared to be its chief favourites ; whilst it only touched 
once or twice on the notes of the greenfinch and the linnet. 
It had been very sparing, also, in its use of the chaffinch's 
note, until one in the neighbourhood had begun to tisoink 
tmnk twink; then the mocking-bird took it up, and twinked 
away for fifty times together. In the next morning the 
linnet's note was much more in request; and it also made 
more use of notes with which I was not acquainted. On 
neither day did it touch upon the notes of the redstart or pied 
wagtail, both^of which I had heard frequently used by the 
mocking-bird* before. On the other hand, I had not previously 
observed the notes of the starling and whin linnet, which this 
bird gave in perfection ; and, therefore, though I have said, 
in my former communication (V. 653, 654.), that I had never 
heard it make use of the notes of any of the larks or thrushes, 
I would not be understood to say that this never happens. 
It is difficult to say, perhaps, that it has a note which is not 
an imitation ; but there is one which it always makes use of 
when any person approaches the nest (intermixed, however, 
with the notes of the swallow, whinchat, and whitethroat) : 
this is something like chur-r-r chur-r-r, prolonging the sound 
of the r very considerably, and in a style which would be quite 
an acquisition to the Northumbrians, if they could attain it.

Art. IV. A Notice of the Songs of the Bramble Finch, the Moun- 
tain Linnety and the Tree Sparrovo ; with Remarks on each 
Species, By Mr. Edward Blyth. 

I AM not aware that the songs of these birds have ever yet 
been described. Mr. Selby, in his account of the first, observes, 
that he is " unable to say whether its notes ever vary in the 
spring, or whether it possesses any proper song." I have 
repeatedly heard its song in confinement, and have one now 
in my possession which sings frequently. Its song consists 
only of a few coarse unmusical notes, generally delivered in 
an under tone ; and not the least resembling the chaffinch's 
song, nor that of any other bird with which I am acquainted. 
I hardly know how to describe the song of the bramble finch : 
if a person were to fill his mouth half full of water, and draw 
it slowly backwards and forwards through his teeth, the sound 
produced would not be much unlike it, at least in part. It 
also utters a kind of chtick, analogous to the twi7ik of the chaf- 
finch ; and sometimes a hoarse jay-like call to its companions. 

The mountain linnet's song is chattering and inarticulate, 

1 1 4 



488 Song of the Mountain Limiet aiid Tree Sparronso. 

bearing a harsh resemblance to that of the linnet. Its notes 
are always hurried and indistinct ; and are mostly delivered in 
successive bursts (if I may be allowed the term), sounding 
like several birds singing together, and reminding one of the 
firing of bells. I have never heard the sound twite, which it 
is alleged to utter ; but its usual notes upon the furze much 
resemble those of the common linnet, being either a low 
tsu-tsU'tsu, or a loud chit chit, I may take this opportunity 
to mention, that, with the twite in confinement, the red on its 
rump entirely disappears on the first moult ; as, from analogy 
with its congeners, might be anticipated. 

The tree sparrow (Passer arboreus ? P. montanus Atict,) 
has been usually described to have no song ; which is incor- 
rect, for one in my possession frequently sings ; and its notes 
are not altogether despicable, being far superior to those of 
the bramblefinch. The tree sparrow, like the common species, 
has a great variety of chirrups ; one of which is peculiarly 
musical and sweet, and may be rendered pee-eu-weep. Its 
proper song consists of a number of these chirps intermixed 
with some pleasing notes, delivered in a continuous unbroken 
strain, sometimes for many minutes together ; very loudly, 
and having a characteristic sparrow tone throughout. 

This is a wild and untractable species in captivity; and, 
consequently, as birds always closely depress their feathers 
when frightened, appears, when looked at, remarkably slen- 
der : yet, when at ease, and undisturbed, the tree sparrow 
always puffs its plumage so as to appear quite as bulky as the 
common species ; and the individual which I have in confine- 
ment has generally this appearance, having lost much of 
its original wildness ; still the species is undoubtedly more 
slender than the P. domesticus. The sexes of it may be dis- 
tinguished easily by the smaller size, in the female, of the 
black spot on the side of the neck : in both, the bill becomes 
quite black in summer. I do not know how this bird came 
to be called " mountain sparrow,'^ and " montanus ; " for it 
appears to me, both from observation, and from what I have 
read of it, only to inhabit valleys ; frequenting low damp 
situations where willows grow, and being more abundant in 
the flats of Lincolnshire than in any other part of Britain. 
The more appropriate term arboreus, therefore, might as well 
be substituted for " montanus," if the latter is thus implicatory 
of error. 

Were I to judge of the temper and disposition of the 
bramble finch from one which I kept in confinement last sum- 
mer, I should call it one of the most untamable of birds ; 
but, were I to form my judgment from the individual which I 



Characteristics of the Mountain Linnet. 489 

possess at present, I should, on the contrary, deem it to be 
very familiar and confiding. This I just cursorily mention as 
a caution to those who would infer the general character and 
disposition of a species from observation of an individual. 
Animals of the same kind often differ greatly in individual 
character; and this is remarkably apparent in a brood of 
ten young bottletits which I have this season reared : it was 
observable even before they had left the nest. 

The bramble finch, like many other species, but chiefly 
those which have deciduous terminal edgings to their winter 
plumage, as the linnets, redstarts, stonechat, pied flycatcher, 
and some of the siskins and grosbeaks, is very much hand- 
somer when two years old than when in its first summer 
livery. The tints of all these birds are considerably brighter 
after they have moulted twice, and then (as is particularly 
observable in the common redstart) a few only of the new 
feathers are fringed with winter edgings. 

I cannot exactly reconcile the mountain linnet, or twite, 
which, in these parts, is a regular winter visitant, with Mr. 
Selby's description of it. That gentleman remarks that " it 
is rather larger than the common linnet, being bulkier in the 
body, and having a longer tail." Now, all the twites which 
I have seen (and they amount to many dozens) have invariably 
been considerably smaller than the common linnet, being 
intermediate in size between that bird and the redpole. Far- 
ther, Mr. Selby's account of it seems to imply that it exhibits 
a marked seasonal change in the tints of its plumage ; " ren- 
dering its summer appearance different from that which it bears 
through the rest of the year." I have specimens in summer 
plumage ; and the only difference I can perceive is an increased 
brightness of colour on the rump plumage, the terminal edg- 
ings of which have disappeared ; but this is by no means con- 
spicuous, being a much slighter difference than is observable 
in the common linnet and the redpole. In other respects, 
Mr. Selby's description of the mountain linnet entirely agrees 
with my birds; only that I see no sexual difference in the 
colour of the upper parts, the rump excepted. Montagu 
describes the twite to be " rather larger than the linnet ; " 
and says, also, " the top of the head and rump red." But 
here he is certainly mistaken as regards the head ; for I can 
say decidedly that the twite (of these parts) has at no time 
any red upon the crown. These discrepancies almost lead 
one to suspect that two different species are yet confused 
together under the name of mountain linnet ; as, I am quite 
convinced, is the case with the redpole. See the Field Na- 
turalist's Magazine for April, 18^, p. 172.

CI. Gasteropoda, Ord. Nudibranchia, Fam. G^laucidse. 
The Tergipes is a naked sea snail with external branchiae 
disposed in two series, one along each side of the back ; they 

are of a cylindrical 

59 ^ ^ ^ . ^ 



form, and it is sup- 
posed that the apex 
of each forms a 
little sucker by 
means of which 
the animal can fix 
itself to the stalks 
and fronds of sea- 
weed, and walk 
upon its back. 
Rang is of opinion 
that this fact re- 
quires new observ- 
ations to assure us of its certainty ; and the species about 
to be described never performed any such remarkable feat 
during the few hours it was preserved. 

One species (Doris maculata Montagu) has already been 
described as a native of the coast of Devon, but it differs in 
so many particulars from ours, that some may deem it ne- 
cessary to arrange them in separate genera, and we, at all 
events, may be spared the necessity of elaborating a compara- 
tive description to prove their distinctness. Tergipes pulcher 
was found in Berwick Bay, upon a piece of wood brought up 
\9sf the line from deep water : its motions were slow and glid- 
ing, like the rest of its tribe ; but, unlike the greater number 
of these, it was ornamented with spots of such warm and 
brilliant colours, that it might possibly have attracted the notice 
of even those who wonder very much what there is in a snail 
that it should have admirers. 

Tergipes pulcher is half an inch long, ovate, soft, white, 
ornamented with scarlet tubercles scattered over the back, 
and with short cylindrical processes tipt with bright orange 
arranged round the sides : mouth subinferior, terminal, with 
a linear-oblong membranous tongue, set with minute prickles 
in close transverse series : tentacula two, dorsal, non-retractile, 
short, oval, imbricate, orange- coloured : back even, studded 
with many scarlet unequal tubercles, some of which, when 



Spdngia siiberta, 491 

magnified, appear ocellated : towards the tail are three short 
white processes placed in a line across the back, which are 
not retractile ; and there are eighteen short obtuse branchial 
processes placed on the margins, the smallest in front, and 
all tipped with orange ; the apices, perhaps, conformed like 
suckers : foot oblong, with plain margins : aperture of gene- 
ration lateral and anterior. 

When viewed through a magnifier, this pretty mollusc has 
a roughish or flocculent appearance. The cloak contains 
numerous calcareous spicula interlaced in every direction, the 
spicula of unequal sizes, curved, with a sort of knob in the 
centre, whence it tapers to each end, the points of some of 
them being forked. The latter sort are abundant in the 
branchial processes, and the forked end is always pointed 
outwards. 

The specific character may be thus expressed : — 
Tergipes 'pulcher, Corpore ovato, albo, supra tuberculis coc- 

cineis notato ; tentaculis duobus, ovatis, imbricatis, aurantiis ; 

branchiis brevibus, apice aurantiis. 

23. ? ^po'ngia sube'ria. {Jig. 60.) 
Our figures of this remarkable production are taken from 
a dried specimen, with the loan of which I was favoured by 
Mr. Bean of Scarborough. It incrusts a univalve shell, 

60 




5p6ngia subferia, of the natural size. 

apparently the Turbo crassior, and entirely covers it. The 
zoophytical crust is thin and uniform, and no pores or faecal 
orifices are visible on the surface, but the processes are hollow, 
and their walls, which are smooth and alike on both surfaces, 
appear to be perforated, in a longitudinal direction, with a 
circle of small canals which probably open on the rim of the 
process ; but this structure is rather inferred from the appear- 
ance presented by the spot from which a process has been 
broken, and from an obscure vestige of pores on the rim, than 
from dissection, and remains, therefore, open to correction. 

The sponge is apparently composed of fine particles of sand 
closely compacted, and is of a uniform grey or stone colour ; 
the surface is even and smooth, but large papillary processes, 
from one to six lines in height, cylindrical and tubular, rise up 
irregularly from it, the apices of which are circular, cupped, 



492 Zoological Illustrations : — Spongia suberia. 

with a thick somewhat inflected and plaited rim. Where the 
sponge incrusts the shell it is thin, but the tubular processes 
are between two and three lines in diameter, and, when re- 
moved at the base, they leave a mark exhibiting a circle of 
cells radiating to the outer edge. 

I am of opinion that this is the jSpongia suberia of Mon- 
tagu {JVern. Mem., i. 100.), in a perfect state. Montagu 
seems to have met with specimens only previous to their pro- 
duction of the tubular processes, and, if we subtract these 
from our description, it will be found to correspond in other 
respects with the description of this excellent observer. He 
says that the " sponge is of a corky nature, resembling the 
close texture of the stalk of some species of jRoletus. It 
has rarely any other pores than what are formed by the fibres, 
which are so extremely fine, as not to be visible to the naked 
eye, even when broken ; and with the assistance of a pocket 
lens, they are not definable on the surface. Its colour is 
orange-yellow when fresh, becoming brown when dry : its 
shape is indefinite, but it has the singular property of being 
attached only (as far as I have been able to ascertain) to old 
univalve shells, which it entirely invests. It is also remark- 
able, that few instances occur where the hermit crab has not 
formed a lodgement in the nucleus shell, and there appears 
to be a great struggle between the two parasitical intruders, 
as the sponge is continually endeavouring to fill up the aper- 
ture of the shell, while the crab, by its occasional motion in 
search of prey, frustrates that natural propensity of the sponge. 
Notwithstanding the efforts of so active and restless an in- 
truder, the gradual and insensible increase of the sponge gains 
upon the premises of the crab ; it pushes it on all sides, and 
completely lines the interior surface of the shell, so that the 
crab soon finds its habitation too small, and is compelled to 
search for a more capacious house." 

Dr. Fleming has placed this sponge in his genus Halichon- 
dra (Brit, Anirru, p. 522.), distinguished from the other 
genera of the family by the siliceous spicula which enter so 
abundantly into its organisation ; and he says that the spicula 
of the species in question, which he has found " incrusting 
corallines in the Frith of Forth," are fusiform and slightly 
curved. Montagu makes no mention of these spicula, which 
probably require a high power of the microscope for their 
detection, and hence they also escaped my observation. To 
any correspondent of this Magazine I should feel much in- 
debted by the communication of specimens of the AS'p6ngia 
suberia, either dried or preserved in spirits.

This remarkable shell is only found in one pond in our

rence. It differs from our specimens of L. pereger in being 
thicker and stronger; is of a darker colour, and only half 
the size : it is certainly very like some of the numerous 
varieties of this shell, yet most of our scientific friends agree 
with us in considering it specifically distinct. The raised lines 
on the body whorl are very variable : in some specimens they 
are nearly obliterated ; but in very few instances are they 
wholly wanting. Mr. G. B. Sowerby, in his Geney^a of Recent 
and Fossil Shells, united Physa, Myxas, and Aplexa to the 
genus Limnea. He says, " the only describable difference in 
the shells, except mere specific differences, consists in the 
Aplexa and Physa being heterostrophe shells, while the Lim- 
nea and Myxas are dextral. The reversed Limnea found 
at Scarborough will certainly prove the correctness of Mr. 
Sowerby's views.

I SEND you a list of land and freshwater shells which I

and water, which adorn that charming neighbourhood, and 
supply to each species an appropriate habitat. I have thought 
it best, in the case of the more rare species, to state exactly 
the locality or situation where each occurs ; as, without this

496 Cane Fly of Grenada, 

Art. VIII. Informatio?i on the Cane Fly of Grenada (Delphax 
saccharivora) additional to that given in VI. 407 — 413. By 
J. O. Westwood, Esq. F.L.S., &c. 

The ravages of this minute but destructive species of insect, 
detailed in VI. 407 — 413., are continued with undiminished 
severity in the Island of Grenada. At the July meeting of 
the Entomological Society, the subject was brought before the 
notice of the meeting by J. C. Johnstone, Esq., of that island, 
who entered into various statements relative to the nature of 
its attacks; from whose remarks it is evident, as I had indeed 
presumed (VI. 410.), that the great mischief done to plants 
originates in the constant suction of the plants by myriads of 
these insects in all their stages. It has been stated [in VI. 
407, 408.) that the eggs are deposited in the midrib of the 
leaves, on the under side, in those plants which had gained con- 
siderable height, the spots in which they are introduced being 
covered with a fine downy white matter. This account, with 
the drawing given in VI. 413. fig. 54. 6, of the position of 
these eggs in the leaf, is calculated to give an erroneous 
idea ; since, from a microscopic examination of some infested 
leaves preserved in spirits, brought over by Mr. Johnstone, I 
have ascertained that the eggs are long and kidney-shaped, 
and are introduced lengthwise into the substance of the mid- 
rib of the leaf to a considerable depth. It is, however, upon 
the young and very tender plants that the greatest injury is 
inflicted; since, evidently from their affording a more de- 
licious repast to the fly, they are so completely overpowered 
with its numbers as to be unable to overcome the injury : they 
bleed to death, and wither into a blackened mass. It is notice- 
able that the north-east side of the island, which is the most 
fruitful, and which has acquired the name of the garden of 
the island, is more especially subject to the fly ; which, in 
some instances, has destroyed two fifths, and even, in some 
plantations, two thirds, of the entire produce. 

It is only within the last few years that this pest has been 
observed in Grenada; and, indeed, it has not yet made its 
appearance in some of the adjacent islands. It has been 
noticed that the first observance of it in the former island was 
preceded by a very violent hurricane. 

A committee has been appointed by the Entomological 
Society to take the subject into consideration, with a view to 
the proposal of the most efficient remedies ; and a report, 
containing a great variety of suggestions, has been prepared 
and sent over to the Agricultural Society of Grenada.

Art. X. Information on the Habitat qfCarex heleonastes Ehrhart 
in Switzertand, and on the Circumstances connected tvith the Dis" 
cover?/ and Identijication of this Species ; xvith like Information 
on the Carex Gaudinmno. Hoppe, By P. J. Brown, Esq., Than, 
Canton of Berne, Switzerland. 

The discovery of the rare Swedish Carex heleonastes (VI. 
469.) on the turf grounds of the Schwarzenegg, near Thun, 
in Switzerland, a spot strikingly similar to many portions of 
the Scottish Highlands, encourages me to hope that this plant 
may ere long be added to the British flora : and it has oc- 
curred to me that the chances of its being detected may be 
much increased by my placing at your disposal the few speci- 
mens still remaining: of those which I brouoht with me to 
England. I therefore take the liberty of troubling you with 
the accompanying small packet, the contents of which you 
will perhaps have the goodness to distribute among your 
botanical friends, more especially those resident in the north. 

The unexpected discovery of the above plant, in Switzer- 
land, is due to the arrival at Thun of M. Guthnick of 
Cologne, a zealous and quicksighted botanist. He, being 
apprised that the same leisure which had enabled me to be- 
come better acquainted than any other person with the distri- 
bution of plants in our neighbourhood, would also allow me

to lead him to the richest spots, proposed to become the com- 
panion of some of my herborisations ; and, as the Cariees 
had formed his favourite study, we were naturally led to the 
peat grounds and marshes. The Schwarzenegg is situated 
at about two leagues n. e. of Thun, at an elevation of proba- 
bly 2500 ft. above the sea, and is chiefly covered with fir 
forests, interspersed with large open spaces of deep wet peat, 
which is dug for fuel. On this spot the Carex heleonastes was 
first found on June 1. 1830, covering the bottom of a ditch 
or drain about 2 ft. wide, and IJft. deep, the soil of which 
is always saturated with water, the surplus of which passes 
off to a deep watercourse at a short distance : the ditch in 
question skirts the edge of a fir forest at the distance of about 
30 yds. or 40 yds. Not being satisfied as to the identity of 
the plant, numerous specimens were distributed, by M. Guth- 
nick and myself, to our various friends in both France and 
Germany, without any intimation of our opinion as to its 
species ; all those who had access to the chief collections 
pronounced it nem. con. to be C heleonastes ; Dr. Hoppe (a 
botanist of great authority for the genus) confirming liis 
opinion by the transmission of an original specimen from the 
herbarium of Ehrhart, by w^hom the species was established. 
This circumstance is merely mentioned to show that reliance 
may be placed on the correctness of the determination. 

[Qdrex Gaiidmmna Hoppe.'] On June 7. 1830, an un- 
known Carex was met with near the edge of the small lake of 
Amsoldingen, about a league from Thun : specimens of this 
also were distributed, and produced a variety of opinions too 
long to be detailed : plants in a living state were demanded 
by many; and, after having been studied from fresh specimens 
both wild and cultivated, it was pronounced to be an unde- 
scribed species, and named by Dr. Hoppe Carex Gawdmidna, 
in honour of the late M. Gaudin of Nyon, author of an in- 
valuable Flora Helvetica. Dr. Hoppe's notice of the plant 
was published in the i^^or^, a small periodical work, in German, 
printed at Ratisbon, and in the number dated April 28. 1832, 
he gives the following character : — 

" Carex (Vignea) Gaudinim-w.. C. stigmatibus binis; spica 
terminali mascula vel pseudo-androgyna, lineari-oblonga ; 
foemineis duabus, sessilibus, approximatis, ovatis, paucifloris; 
fructibus ovato-oblongis, apice bifid is, acuminatis, squama 
ovata longioribus ; caule tereti, glabro; foliis linearibus, ca- 
naliculatis; radice stolonifera." The species is inserted by 
Gaudin in the Appendix to his Flora, published shortly before 
his death ; and, having two or three individuals still in London, 
eg leave to place them also in your hands.

Art. XI. Short Communications, 

Zoology. — Reason versus Instinct. — I have never felt 
convinced, nor satisfied, with the limitation to which the 
actions of animals are confined by the term instinct, as applied 
to them. True, a chicken, for example, if hatched by steam, 
and brought up by an "artificial mother," as Mowbray styles 
the flannel succedaneum for a hen, would perform its offices 
of incubation perfectly, and in due season, although it should 
never have received instructions from its mother, or by com- 
munication with any of its congeners : this is instinct. But 
when circumstances occur which could never have been con- 
templated as likely to befall it, by what name shall we desig- 
nate the cause or motive which actuates its movements ? 
A neighbour of ours, on whose word, I believe, I may safely 
rely, related the following anecdote to me the other day. 
His amateur farmyard, I should premise, is beautifully ar- 
ranged, and always reminds me of that belonging to Joshua 
Geddes, the glorious quaker in Redgauntlet, My neigh- 
bour's pigsties are railed off on two sides of the yard, where 
food in abundance awaits the happy y«;* nicnte inmates; but, 
as it was discovered that the fowls partook too largely of that 
which was intended only for pigs, their wings were clipped, 
in order to prevent them from flying over ; and the operation 
produced the desired result. One of the fowls, however, 
discovered a method by which to baffle the contrivers of its 
disappointment. Several pigs were loose in the yard, whose 
movements were watched by the bird, and, as one of them 
wandered near the intervening rail, it flew upon the back of 
the animal, and thence easily gained the tops, over which it 
fluttered into the enclosure, and thus obtained the desired

but interdicted banquet. Was this the result of forethought, 
combining of circumstances, or, in short, reason ? Could it 
be instinct ? — Campanella, Berkshii'e. {^Received, Ja7i, 9,

Upon this subject, see IV. 498.; V. 276. ; VII. 481.; acts 
of birds, 518.; acts of the hare, 506. I had once a fine 
young cat, which I had brought up in an uninhabited house, 
in a garden, whither I, in most mornings, carried from my 
own place of residence, milk for " Mas " (the name I had 
given to my cat). A bell was so hung over the door of the 
private entrance to the garden as to be struck, and made to 
sound pretty loudly, every time the door was opened. Mas 
would sometimes be along with my fellow-workmen in the 
garden at a good distance from the door ; but, on the bell's 
sounding at the usual time of Mas's receiving his breakfast, 
he would quit my fellow-workmen instantly, and gallop like 
a greyhound towards the door. — J. D, 

A Communication of Ideas in Animals of different Genera, 
— Last spring an old mare (she has, I believe, completed her 
twentieth year, and has lost an eye), being relieved, in con- 
sideration of age and infirmity, from heavy labour, was turned 
out, in company with a cow and four or five heifers, into a 
small field at a distance from their former companions. The 
grass in this enclosure was not very plentiful, and the adjoin- 
ing pasture being adorned ^vith luxuriant vegetation, and 
divided by an indifferent fence, they frequently took the 
liberty of trespassing upon the neighbouring property. This, 
indeed, occurred so often, that a watch was obliged to be set 
upon their actions ; and one day a singular instance of ani- 
mal instinct was observed. The mare, doubtless tired of 
staying so long at home, made the circuit of the field, with a 
view to escape from her confinement; and, having discovered 
a place suited for her exit, she returned to her horned com- 
panions, who were ruminating at a little distance, and, having 
approached the cow, she gently struck her on the shoulder, 
first with her hoof, and then with her head. The cow being 
roused from her revery, the loving friends advanced toge- 
ther to tlie gap, and, having jointly reconnoitred it, returned 
to the rest, and then, the old mare leading the way, the 
whole company leaped over in succession after her. —

A cat and dog of my father's, brought up together from 
their infancy, would, when they had grown up, amuse them- 
selves for an hour together in chasing, in company, wild 
rabbits, which were successively straying into the garden.

The foraging couple would be off the first thing in the morn- 
ing, and again in the evening; and a near relative, from 
whom I learn this, has known them, in one instance, to bring 
home a half-grown rabbit. — J, D. 

The Communication of Ideas in Animals of the same Species 
is instanced daily to all observers. I saw a very clear case of 
it on September 15. 1833. I was crossing two meadows, or 
paddocks, divided by a hedgerow, but connected by a gate- 
way from which the gate was absent. Several cows were 
grazing in the farther meadow, from whom a bull was coming 
into the nearer meadow, to fetch up, as soon appeared, 
two cows that had strayed behind, and were still grazing in 
the nearer. He called to them at the gateway, and then 
walked to them, when they ceased grazing, and walked before 
him to the main party in the farther meadow. — J. D.

In The Whitehaven Herald of May 20. 1834, there is, 
under the title of " A Scrap of Natural History," a delectable 
description of the " personal appearance and habits " of " the 
mart, martin, yellow- breasted mart, or sweet mart." The 
'* scrap" occupies nearly a column. We wish the writer 
would narrate the natural history of all the British animals 
in like manner. This remarkable fact is mentioned : — 
" There is at present in the possession of an inhabitant of 
this town a couple of young marts, to which the cat belong- 
ing to the house is performing all the tender offices of a 
parent. . . The little creatures were blind, and about the size of 
kittens of a corresponding age ; and, when first caught, sucked 
milk readily, through a quill, on which they were supported 
for two or three days, until a cat was found to discharge the 
office of their hapless parent [which had been chased to hel' 
nsst or bield, driven out of it with smoke, and killed]. Puss 
had a kitten of her own at the time, which was taken from 
her to make room for the intruders, whom she has cherished 
with true maternal affection. Since their capture, they have

ance." 

T/ie Stoat {Mustela erminea). — It seems to have been 
commonly imagined that change of colour from the usual 
tint to white is the invariable effect of cold. [V. 718.; VI. 79.] 
Yet this change occurs in the mild climate of Cornwall as 
often as in other parts of England ; and not always in winter. 
Mr. C. Jackson of East Looe had, at one time, in his pos- 
session, three specimens that were all over white, except on 
the back of the neck and shoulder, which was brown, and the 
black tip of the tail. They were proved not to be young by 
the canine teeth being worn down. — J. Couch. Polperro^ 
Cornwall, May 29. 1834. [On the stoat, see, besides, 
VI. 202., and the references given in VI. 208.] 

The Weasel sucks the Blood of its Prey. — Rusticus of Go- 
dalming (VI. 197.) denies this, and says that " the weasel 
only eats the brain." This is a bold assertion, at variance 
with the opinions of most, if not all, modern (and, as far as 
I am aware, ancient) naturalists (but no matter for that; 
they are all mere copyists, at least since the flood, according 
to Rusticus ; Linnaeus, Jussieu, Cuvier, &c., are only copyists, 
in other words, plagiarists) : and, before it can be received as 
a fact applicable to the species generally, it must be ascer- 
tained by proofs much more evident and convincing than the 
single one brought forward by Rusticus. Presumption and 
invective have little weight nowadays. That the weasel will 
eat the brain of its prey, I have no doubt ; and it will devour 
the blood, flesh, and all (except the bones), when hungry. 
When satiated, or little hungry, it will generally only suck 
the blood ; but should it, during the conflict with the subject 
of its attack, injure the skull so as to cause an extrusion of 
medullary matter, it will frequently devour this as well as the 
blood. But the weasel, like the polecat, and the other Po- 
marii of Cuvier, is decidedly sanguinary in its habits, and 
prefers blood to everything else. It generally destroys its 
victim by attacking it in its head or neck ; most frequently in 
the latter part, when its prey is much inferior to it in strength, 
and can, consequently, make little resistance; the animal being 
probably instinctively inclined to attach itself to this part, 
owing to a large artery (the carotid) being situated there. 
I have seen the weasel kill four young ducks in just half an 
hour : it attacked them in the throat, sucked their blood, and 
afterwards left them. — J. Jojies. Gelly, Montgomeryshire, 
March 28. 1834. [To the list of the weasel's objects of prey, 
the mole may now (see Mr. Couch, in p. 458.) be added.] 

White Hares. — I find the following remarks in my journal, 



Mammiferous Animals, 505 

under date of January, 1829: — 'A gentleman Informs me 
that the hounds with which he was hunting yesterday chased, 
for a considerable time, a white hare; that one was killed, 
not long since, near the same place ; and that some young 
ones of the same colour have been seen. It is supposed that 
there are seven in the same neighbourhood ; and it is certain 
they have been seen in summer as well as winter. Indeed, 
cold cannot now have caused the change, since we have had 
none until within these few days. The gentleman upon whose 
estate they are wishes to preserve the breed; on which 
account the hounds were drawn off before they had killed 
that which they had hunted. Again, under the date of Fe- 
bruary, 1832, I find I have noted as follows: — Many white 
hares have been seen in the same neighbourhood during 
several years. One that I have now examined was white, 
but with a perceptible universal tinge of brown ; the ears 
whitish without black tips ; under the feet, brown, as in com- 
mon hares. Another, examined by Mr. Jackson, was of a 
pure white ; ears of the ordinary length, not tipped with 
black ; lips white. Thus, it appears that these were only 
specimens of a variety of the common hare; but it is singular 
that it should have existed and propagated on one estate for 
several years ; and, it would appear, without varying accord- 
ing to the season. — J. Couch. Polperro, Cornxmll, May 29. 
1834. 

A dateless scrap lying by us advises us of a fine white hare, 
shot in Bleasdale, which had been put into a state of preserv- 
ation for the owner, Mr. Hall. 

A Two-coUmred Hare was, some years ago, shot upon the 
lawn, about The Mount, near Bury St. Edmunds, by M. T. 
Cocksedge, Esq., since deceased, then resident at The Mount, 
and proprietor of the estate. This was stuffed, and placed in 
a glass case over the fireplace in his gun-room, where it 
remained as lately as January, 1834, when I saw it there. 
As nearly as 1 remember, the greater proportion of the fore 
half of the body was white ; the remainder, of the usual colour 
of hares, or, perhaps, rather lighter. — J. D. 

A veryjine Black Hare was killed on January 15. 1833, on 
the estate of Wm. Selby Lowndes, Esq., called Tuckey Hill 
Farm, in the parish of Winslow, Bucks. The head and legs 
were as black as jet, and had much the ap})earance of black 
silk velvet. Its weight was nearly 7 lbs. (BeW s Life in Lou- 
don, Feb. 10. iS2,S.) —James Fennell. 

The fact of the capture of a black hare, in January or 
February, 1828, at Combe, near Coventry, is registered in 
I. 84. ; and the occurrence of a wild black variety of the 



506 Short Communications : — 

rabbits on the northern coast of the county of Donegal, in 
Ireland, in V. 579. The editorial query adduced in the latter 
place, on the wildness of the black variety in this locality, is, 
doubtless, quite superfluous. Looking on the months in which 
the black hares were captured, the thought arises that snow 
was probably on the ground, and gave the blackness ot the 
hares that conspicuousness which led to the destruction of 
them. — J". D. 

Sagacity of the Hare, — The French Maiiuel du Chasseur, 
quoting Jacques du Fouilloux, the author of a celebrated 
Treatise on Hunting, first printed in 1561 (folio, at Poitiers) 
says, — "I have seen a hare, when meaning to practise a de- 
ception, quit its seat without being alarmed by a dog, go to a 
pond, at the distance of a quarter of a league, wash itself, 
and pass off again from the water through a quantity of 
rushes. I have seen a hare, that has been chased for full two 
hours by the hounds, thrust another hare from its seat, and 
take its place. I have seen hares swim successively through 
two or three ponds, of which the smallest was fourscore 
paces round. I have also seen them, after having been 
chased for ten hours, creep under the door of a sheep-house 
[d'lin toit a brebis), and rest itself among the cattle. I have 
seen them, when before the dogs, get into the middle of a 
flock of sheep, and accompany them in all their motions over 
the field, avoiding to quit them by any means. I have seen 
them pass forward on one side of a hedge, and return by the 
other, there being only the breadth of the hedge between 
the hare and the hounds. I have also seen them, after half 
an hour's chase, spring on the top of an old wall, 6 ft. in 
height, and there settle on the narrow covering of ivy." — 
J. Couch, Polperro, Cor?iivall, May 29. 1834^. 

Monstrosity in a Hare. — On Monday, a young hare, 
nearly a month old, was found near the Hay (having been 
killed by a stone), which presented a most singular conform- 
ation. The head and fore feet were perfect down to the 
back, where two separate bodies commenced, each completed 
with legs and tails, but separate from the navel, and of the 
male genus, the two bodies appearing equally strong and 
perfect. This singular curiosity is now in the possession of 
Mr. T. Cooke, auctioneer, of Hereford. {Bath Herald, 
quoted in the Morriing Hei'dld, August 1. 1825.) 

The Otter (Liitra vulgaris Flem.). — The Manuel du Chas- 
seur affords the following information respecting the habits of 
the otter : — " It does not dig the hole in which it lives ; but 
occupies the first convenient cavity, among the roots of trees, 
or crevices of rocks. It feeds on fish and crabs ; and when

it is desirable to entrap it, in a river or place where fish are 
common, but not crabs, the latter should be chosen for bait. 
A white stone, or some rubbish [of old mortar, plaster, &c.] 
sufficiently conspicuous, should be placed on the sand; the 
animal will be attracted to examine this ; and it ends by 
depositing on it its excrement. Within two or three feet of 
this, a bank of sand should be raised, 1 ft. in width, and 1 in. 
high ; on this the bait is to be set ; which bait, whether fish 
or crab, must be fresh, for if it have been dead but a few 
hours, the otter will not touch it. If it is found that the bait 
has been taken, we next proceed to set the trap. This is a 
common gin ; and, if baited with a crab, it should be alive, 
somewhat crushed, to prevent its struggles, and fastened on 
its back. [We hope that not any naturalist will practise 
this.] The gin should be secured, that the otter may not 
drag it away. This animal has a singular habit of constantly 
dropping its excrement in the same spot, and commonly near 
a white stone that chance may have thrown on the shore. 
The dung may be known by the remains of fishes and of 
crabs' claws which it contains ; and, if it be found fresh, the 
otter may certainly be taken the same evening. If not, how- 
ever, a white stone or old plastering should be placed in the 
road it is known to take. As night approaches, the hunter 
should silently advance to his station, behind the shelter of a 
tree or other blind, within fifteen or twenty paces of the 
mark. A moonlight night should be chosen, as the otter is 
slow to quit its hole. The sportsman will be informed of the 
approach of the animal rather by his ears than his eyes ; its 
diving to fish and rising again may be heard at a considerable 
distance. At this time the eyes must be kept fixed on the 
white mark on the sand ; for to that the animal will come at 
last. If the creature be only wounded by the shot, so that 
it retains strength to throw itself into the water, it is useless 
to search for it in the morning ; for it certainly will not be 
found. If it escape mortally wounded, it gets among the 
immersed roots of trees or stones, and there continues at- 
tached." The following notes are derived from my own 
observation. The otter occupies, in the summer, and when 
the weather will permit, a retired and quiet station near 
where the land stretches into the ocean. Here it is able to 
discover danger while at a distance, and to retreat in what- 
ever direction it seems fit. It swims low in the water, and 
will go a mile or more after prey. The neighbourhood of a 
populous harbour is a frequent station ; and I have known it 
repeatedly pass up the little river at Polperro, beneath my 
parlour window, undeterred by the numerous noisy children

at play close to its track, but apparently trusting for security 
to the dusk of a summer's evening. The young ones are 
playful and active. Fishes seem to have a peculiar dread of 
the otter; for I am credibly informed that it has been seen to 
collect into a scull [shoal] a vast number of trouts in a river, 
and to drive them before it, until the greater part have thrown 
themselves on shore. 

An Individual of the Great Seal F {Vhbca harhdta) taken at 
Padstoiso^ CornwalL — The specimen was 38 in. long, and 
25 in. round close behind the fore flippers ; but the measure- 
ments were made after it had been stuffed, and it had shrunk 
in the drying. From snout to eye, 3 in. ; from the front of 
the mouth to its angle, 2 J in. ; teeth conical, pointed, a little 
curved ; front teeth shorter ; canine teeth numerous, those of 
the upper and lower jaw interlocking ; the grinders could not 
be examined. Upper lip broad, rounded, in two lobes. 
Nostrils separated by a black cind naked channel. Whiskers 
on the lobes of the upper lip, long and numerous ; one row 
contracted in many parts of their course, as I have seen in 
the sea lion of Tristan d'Acunha. From the snout to the 
orifice of the ear, 5^ in. ; no external ear : from the snout to 
the shoulder, 14-^ in.; consequently the neck is long: from 
the heel of the hand of the fore flipper to the point of the toe, 
Sjin. ; tail, 2| in. long; hind flippers, Tin. long; breadth 
of the hind foot at the claws, 8 in.; body, 13 in. round just 
before the tail. Five claws on each foot, long, sharp, curved. 
Hair straight, silky, abundant. Three whiskers a little above 
the hinder angle of each eye. Colour white, with numerous 
black spots and patches. This specimen was taken in a net, 
near Padstow, in Cornwall, in January, 1832. The only 
figure I am able to find is in Gesner, where the likeness is 
good, except the forehead, which is too high. I suppose the 
specimen to be of the species Phoca barbata, which Turton 
says is white when young, and dark when old. It is probable 
that this specimen is in the intermediate state, with the dark 
appearing through the white ground. — J. Conch Polperro,

were written during a residence at the He aux Noix, a small 
island, containing an English garrison, on Lake Champlain, 
near the mouth of the river Richelieu, a tributary of the

shooting not so good as is generally imagined ; though a 
good shot may bag his three brace of grouse a day. The 
only bird here in winter, that can be ciilled game, is what the 
natives call a partridge ; but, in England, we should pro- 
nounce it a ptarmigan: it is the wood partridge (Tetrao 
umbellus) of Wilson's American Ornithology, In very severe 
weather, the birds of this species perch on the tall hemlock 
spruce trees (^^bies canadensis) ; and, from their white plu- 
mage, and their remaining perfectly stationary, are very difficult 
to see ; but, in the evening and early in the morning, they 
fly to the stunted birches for the buds, which, while the snow 
covers the ground, constitute their principal food. In mode- 
rate weather, and particularly when the ground is free from 
snow, they fly into the low brushwood, in flocks of five 
or six ; and then, with a good dog to spring them, and 
back immediately, they will fly to the first tree ; when it 
requires only a sharp eye and a steady aim to transfer them 
to your game-bag. They are not only splendid birds 
in appearance, but, when dressed secundum artem (with a 
cook's skill), will tickle the palate of the most determined 
gou7'mand. The cock bird has a singular call for its mate. 
Alighting on the stump of a tree, he strikes it violently and 
quickly with his wings, which produces a loud hollow sound ; 
and, from the noise having some resemblance to that of a 
muffled drum when beaten, it is called " drumming." This 
may be heard, on a still evening, at the distance of nearly 
half a mile. I have said before that these birds are very 
difficult to see in trees. Shooting one day, I saw, as well as 
a boy who accompanied me, one of them fly into a fir tree : 
we looked for a long time without being able to find it ; and 
were on the point of giving up the search, when we fancied 
we saw it sitting on the flat part of a branch near the trunk. 
I gave the boy my double-barreled gun, who fired ; but the 
bird never stirred. Feeling satisfied, however, that it was 
there, I fired the second barrel ; when it fell to the ground 
dead. Like the ptarmigan of Europe, they are but little 
alarmed at the noise of a gun; and are so stupid, that, if 
three or four perch in a tree, they may be all shot by simply 
taking care to fire at the lowest bird first. The cock of this 
species of grouse weighs 19 oz., and the hen nearly as much. 
A speckled woodpecker, with a red head, and of about the 
size of our redwing ('7'urdus /liacus); the common blue jay; 
a tomtit, somewhat larger than our Parus major ; a large 
brown owl (a singularly beautiful bird); and a bird of the 
pie kind, constitute, as far as I have been able to observe, 
the catalogue of birds that pass the winter in this part of

Lower Canada. I should, however, except the snow bunting, 
or snow flake (Emberiza nivalis). This hardy little fellow is 
said to build in Greenland ; and is found not only upon the 
hoary mountains of Spitzbergen, and upon the inhospitable 
shores of Hudson's Bay, but in the highest northern latitudes 
that our navigators have reached. It feeds on the ground ; 
and, from having the long claw of the lark (^lauda arvensis), 
and not perching in trees [see VI. 486*.], has frequently been 
mistaken for a white variety of that bird. 

The immense flights of the passenger pigeons that pass 
over here must be seen to be credited. We are, however, all 
familiar with Wilson's and Audubon's descriptions of them. 
They seem to migrate with a south-west wind. 

The martins (//irundo urbica) arrive here about the middle 
of March ; and are soon followed by another and larger spe- 
cies, called here the black martin. This I take to be the 
H. melba. The inhabitants prepare small houses for them ; 
and they take possession of them as soon as they arrive. 

The only humming-bird here or in the States is the red- 
throated species ( Trochilus Colubris). They come about the 
end of April, and depart the latest of the summer birds. 
During the hot weather, they are seldom much about in the 
middle of the da3\ From the early part of June to near the 
end of August, they retire into the most impenetrable parts of 
the woods, where they breed ; and are never seen, except in 
the morning and evening. One reason of this absence during 
the day appears to be, that, while the sun is shining hot upon 
the flowers, very little honey is secreted : and, as their food 
chiefly consists of honey [see I. S?!., V. 473. 475. 675.], they 
cannot obtain it ; but, when the weather is moist and cloudy, 
they may then be seen busily engaged in extracting their food 
from the flowers. I have seen as many as eight or ten hum- 
ming and hoverinoj round the blossoms of the scarlet runners. 
The young ones fly about the first week in August ; and, 
from that time until the middle of September, they perch in 
the sticks [placed to support the stems and branches] of the 
above plants. Here they will remain for hours, being fed by 
the old birds ; whose affection for them is so great, that they 
will not allow any bird to come near them. The male of this 
species of humming-bird does not assume its full plumage 
until the spring ; the female is a beautiful bird, but greatly 
inferior in splendour to the male. By remaining quite still 
near a flower they frequent, they will come within a yard of 
you. A friend of mine, on whose fidelity and accuracy I can 
depend, witnessed the following scene ; which I relate in illus- 
tration of the pugnacious habits of these birds ; — There is,

in the West Indies, a bird called the chicken-hawk : one of 
them had attempted to carry oiF a young humming-bird ; 
when the parent bird flew with the rapidity of an arrow, and 
brought the hawk in agony to the ground, having pierced the 
posterior part of its body with its bill. 

The last bird of passage that arrives here is the goatsucker, 
which appears by the middle of May. They are very nume- 
rous ; and resemble the one in England, but are larger. On 
fine still nights, they fly very high, and make a loud humming 
noise v/ith their wings as they rapidly descend. They call 
them in this country the mosquito hawk ; a more appropriate 
name, as relates to the habits of the bird, than that of goat- 
sucker. — O. Clapton, Feb. 1834!. 

Of the Forked-tail Kite, we have a few about us : it is pro- 
vincially called the " crotched-tail puddock." One flew over 
the garden a few days ago, mobbed by several rooks. The 
gardener, on seeing this bird, remarked, " What fierce things 
they are when they 've got nests ! I was along with a boy 
once, who got up to one ; and the old one picked a hole smack 
through his hat, and scratched his hand properly, before he 
could make her go off" the nest. There used to be a good 
many of them about here once, but there are not many of them 
now." The latter part of the last remark is perfectly correct.

Some of the Habits of the Lesser Black-backed Gull (Ldrus 
fiiscus) ; as shoxim by an Individual of this Species in partial 
Coyifinement. — The individual to be spoken of is at present 
in the grey or immature plumage, which, we are told, these 
birds retain for several years. He has the full range of a 
large garden, his escape being only prevented by Laving his 
wing cut; but he constantly prefers the neighbourhood of a 
large network cage, the residence of a pair of silver plieasants : 
not very congenial companions, one would suppose, for a 
roamer of the ocean. But such is the fondness of almost all 
animated beings for society of some kind or other, that, when 
that of their own species is out of reach, they will often 
attach themselves to creatures of a very foreign character. 
Near his gallinaceous friends our gull always sleeps, seldom 
straying to any considerable distance; though he seems to 
enjoy, at times, using his wings to the utmost of his ability ; 
half-flying, half-running, in all directions, apparently for mere 
amusement. He is, however, very tame ; and will, when 
hungry, follow any of the family about the garden, uttering a 



512 Shorl Communications : — 

peculiar cry, which always means that he is quite ready for a 
meal. Indeed, he has a most voracious appetite, and the 
capacity of his throat is truly astonishing : he has repeatedly 
swallowed, quite whole, with bill, claws, and feathers, various 
small birds which had been shot and thrown to him. Mice 
or other small quadrupeds appear equally to suit his taste ; 
and, though he has no objection to butcher's meat, he seems 
rather to prefer small animals, notwithstanding the hair, fea- 
thers, &c., which sometimes give him not a little trouble to 
dispose of satisfactorily. The way in which he remedies this 
difficulty suggested itself the first time a bird was given him : 
I believe it was a skylark. After some ineffectual efforts to 
swallow it, he paused for a moment; and then, as if suddenly 
recollecting something, he ran off at full speed to a pan of 
water, shook the bird about in it until well soaked, and imme- 
diately gulped it down without farther trouble. Since that 
time, he invariably has recourse to the same expedient in 
similar cases, however distant he may be from the pan when 
any difficulty arises. He once, by this means, managed to 
swallow the head of a fowl ; bill, bones, feathers, and all. 
He does not appear particularly to prefer fish, which we may 
suppose his more natural food ; though he will eat it plenti- 
fully when hungry ; and he is generally by no means nice in 
his diet, having lately eaten, with apparent pleasure, a putrid 
weasel, taking, however, especial care that it should not go 
down " tail foremost.'' I have some reason to believe that 
he casts up the bones, fur, and feathers of what he swallows, 
in the manner of the owls, &c. ; as I have occasionally found 
a little bunch of very white bones, mixed with fur, near his 
sleeping-place. Whether or not this bird would have had 
any inclination to feast on his winged neighbours, had they 
never been given him when dead, I cannot say ; but I have 
frequently observed him not only earnestly watching the 
small birds as they were hopping near him, but actually 
pursuing them for some distance : and, in one instance, almost 
successfully, for a chaffinch had nearly fallen a victim to his 
predatorial propensity, after he had chased it a considerable 
way. Altogether, he is an amusing fellow ; but, as he has 
shown no small inclination to mischief, in plucking off the 
flowers, pulling up the labels, emptying the flower-pots, and 
scattering the mould over the walks, his fate is somewhat 
doubtful : and I fear it is more than probable that his life 
will have to pay the forfeit of his crimes. — S, K, Sudhiirij,

An Attack of a large Sea Gull, in the Manner of a Species 
of rapacious Bird^ upon a Kittiiscake Gidl. — As the following 



Birds. 513 

circumstance seems rather extraordinary, perhaps some corre- 
spondent will please to inform me whether it is known usually 
to occur among birds of the gull kind : — As I was returning 
from collecting fossils in the neighbourhood of Charmouth, 
Dorsetshire, my attention was drawn to a large seagull dart- 
ing down into the river, and taking up in its feet (or bill ?) a 
small gull (which afterwards proved to be akittiwake) to some 
height in the air; when it let it drop, and caught it again, 
several times, till it came at last down towards the river : when 
I ran to the spot, and shouted as loud as I could ; and made 
the large gull drop the bird, which I secured at last, in a 
dying state, by jumping into the river; and, having taken it 
home, preserved it for my brother's collection. The large 
one, however, hovered over for some time, with the view of 
obtaining it again. As the captured bird has, instead of a 
fourth toe, only a small warty protuberance, so remarkable, 
that we noticed it before we referred to Montagu or Bewick, 
it is impossible to mistake this for any other species than the 
kittiwake. 

{The Kittiwalce is common on the Coast of Dorsetshire^] — • 
It is rather remarkable that Montagu should mention the 
kittiwake as a rare bird in the south of England, he having 
stated only one instance as occurring, in which three birds of 
this species were washed ashore in Devonshire. My brother 
and myself shoot them more commonly than those of any 
other species of gull. I may also mention 

A few rather rare Birds that are met with in this neigh- 
bourhood; namely: — Purple sandpiper (Tringa maritima), 
grey phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus), bee-eater (Merops 
apiaster), whimbrel (Numenius minor), ash-coloured falcon 
(Circus cinerarius), merlin (Falco ^'salon), cirl bunting 
(Emberiza Cirlus), red-legged crow (Graculus rufipes), red- 
necked grebe (Podiceps rubricoUis), stone curlew (Charadrius 
cedicnemus ; and the forked-tail petrel (Procellaria LeachzV), 
which was found dead in a field at Charmouth. All of these, 
except the Merops, are in our collection. Tiie Merops is 
now in the collection of Dr. Roberts, at Bridport : it was shot 
at Chidcock some years since. 

In the Sherborne paper, another instance is mentioned of 
this bird having been shot, somewhere near Plymouth, on 
April 1. 1818. It is now, I believe, in the British Museum.

The Eggs of the Carrion Crow are sometimes covered, (VI. 
209.) — I am nothing of an ornithologist, and feel by no 
means inclined to question the allegations of such a writer as 
Mr. Waterton, but I think the following remark (VI. 209.)> 
in reference to the nest and eggs of the carrion crow, should 
be received with some qualification : — " Not a single particle 
of the lining of the nest is ever seen betwixt the eggs and the 
eye of him who has ascended the tree to take a view of them." 
This, I am bound to believe, had I no other authority than 
that of Mr. Waterton, is generally the case ; yet, certainly, 
not universally. I climbed a birch tree last year, on which 
was situated a carrion crow's nest: it contained four eggs, 
and of these two only were visible, the others being covered 
by a quantity of loose moss, and wool, contained in the in- 
terior of the nest. This is the only instance I have seen, but 
I am persuaded that it is an occasional occurrence, or it 
would not, probably, have fallen under my observation, during 
the few opportunities I have taken of examining crows' nests. 
I presume, however, that the nest of the carrion crow is most 
frequently perfectly smooth, as Mr. Waterton says ; but I 
have observed it in two or three instances to contain more or 
less loose materials, such as wool, hair, moss, &c. — J, Jones.

nion exercised as before. I once observed a pair of crows 
using the materials of the nest of a former year, in constructing 
a new one; and it struck me as a specimen of much fore- 
thought, for there certainly must remain a considerable por- 
tion of the old nest perfectly efficient for the construction of 
the new, and in thus using those materials much extra-labour 
must evidently be spared. — C Conway. Pontnewydd Works,

A tame Jackdaw so attached to its Protector as to accompany 
him wherever he may go. — Six weeks or two months ago I at- 
tended a coursing meeting, composed, altogether, of at least 
two hundred persons, where I was very much struck with a 
tame jackdaw that kept flying one minute close over our heads, 
the next perching on some bush or tree not ten yards off, and 
every now and then fearlessly lighting on the ground in the 
midst of the crowd of footmen and horsemen. Upon enquiry, 
I found that Jack belonged to a poor boy, six or seven years 
old, who had come to see the coursing, and who, wherever 
he went, was constantly accompanied by his faithful follower. 
Let him wander from home as far as he might. Jack never 
failed to attend him ; perpetually hovering about and repeating 
his cry of affectionate glee. Others might approach him, but 
he would suffer none to touch him, save his master only. —

The Song of the Jay described. — Jays are, unfortunately for 
our pea-growers, numerous in this neighbourhood. I had 
never, however, heard a jay sing until last April (1833), and 
had become rather inclined to doubt Montagu's statement 
regarding its singing. On April 19., I took a walk to the 
mountain side, and, passing through one of our shadowy over- 
hung mountain lanes, in search of mosses, it led me through 
a small wood far away from human intrusion. Here my at- 
tention was arrested by a rustling in the wood, accompanied 
by a great clatter, and occasionally interspersed with more 
sonorous tones. Directing my attention closely to the part 
of the wood whence the sounds came, I at last descried a jay 
in continued action, fluttering and shufiling, and leaping from 
spray to spray in continued motion, and in uninterrupted 
song. My presence, at first, disturbed the bird, but it soon 
got the better of its timidity, and again fell to singing. It 
mocked the greenfinch most inimitably, and it was a consi-

derable time before I could persuade myself that it was an 
imitation. But what amused me most of all was its produc- 
tion of the neighing of the horse. This was so near the 
truth, that some companions who were with me were a long 
time before they would be convinced that the sounds pro- 
ceeded from the bird. The neighing was very subdued and 
suppressed, but it bore the most striking resemblance to the 
neighing of a colt heard at a distance ; indeed, so close was 
the imitation, that, without a sight of the bird, no person 
could possibly, I think, be persuaded that the sound proceeded 
from such an agent. These imitations were accompanied, 
occasionally, with more subdued and very melodious notes. 
Before I had parted with my mocking friend, I wished to 
have farther proof of its skill ; I therefore whistled in different 
notes, and was immediately answered in exactly the same 
strain. I was disappointed in the object of my ramble ; but 
was abundantly satisfied in being so fortunate as to hear the 
song of the jay. — C, Conway. Pontneisoydd Woi^ks^ near New-

JDucJcs with the Toes not connected by a Web or Memb?'ane, 
and the Upper Mandible imperfect : presumed to have proceeded

— The notice on hybrid birds, in p. 153., recalled to my mind 
the seeing once some apparently hybrid ducks about the 
aquarium in the Cambridge Botanic Garden, and led me to 
apply to Mr. Arthur Biggs, the curator of that establishment, 
for some information on them. He has obligingly replied (in 
a communication dated April 19. 1834) to the following 
amount : — " The ducks were three : they were bred at a small 
farm at Gamlingay, Cambs, and were bought, about seven 
years ago, by Mr. Bowles, veterinary surgeon, Cambridge, 
who sent them to the Botanic Garden, and, after they had 
remained here some time, presented them to the London 
Zoological Society : they were added to the Society's farm at 
Kingston, Surrey. I have not heard any thing of them since. 
All that I can recollect about them is, that they differed from 
common ducks in the upper part of their beak being twisted 
and jagged, and so much smaller than the lower part, that it 
was with some difficulty that they could gather up their food ; 
and in being not web-footed, but having feet like those of a 
hen. The colour of one of them was a dark brown, like that 
of some hens ; the other two were nearly of the usual colour 
of common ducks. One of them manifested a dislike to go 
into water ; so much so, that, when driven to the water, it would 
turn away. The general appearance, and the habits of all 
were such as to induce many persons to suppose that they

were mule beings which had been produced from a union 
between the common species of duck and the common species 
of fowl." It will be observed that it is not intimated of what 
species the supposed male and female parent were conjectured 
to be. We have ascertained, however, that at the examina- 
tion, after death, of one of the specimens sent to the Zoological 
Society, the form and character of the bones, and of all the 
viscera, were those of a true duck.]

a pair of fledged ringdoves from a nest, confined them in an 
aviary, and fed them on young peas and barley. When I 
had kept them about a month, the female died, and I turned 
the survivor out : he immediately flew to a neighbouring 
wood, and I expected that I was then seeing him for the last 
time ; but, to my great astonishment, I found him a few hours 
afterwards, perched upon a box inside an open shed in which 
my pigeons were kept. This was ever afterwards his favourite 
station, and he never showed any inclination to repair to his 
native haunts (as it is said they invariably do, when turned 
loose), but always remained with the other pigeons, and fol- 
lowed them in all their windings and circuits. On the 12th 
of January, 1833, he fell ill, and died a few days afterwards : 
he was in my possession six months. — W, H. H. Burton on

Facts on the Quail [Coturnix vulgaris Fleming). — I found, 
on August 12. 1833, a quail's nest in the middle of a field 
which had been of barley, but in which clover was then grow- 
ing. The nest, placed upon the ground, was made of grass 
and a few straws and clover stalks; it contained ten eggs, 
which were pear-shaped, with large and small brown blotches, 
upon an ash ground. This bird's natural shyness was much 
diminished during incubation ; so much so, that she would 
almost allow herself to be caught, without quitting the nest; 
she was, however, so frequently disturbed that she entirely 
forsook it after sitting about a week. Pennant says that 
quails resort to Essex in considerable numbers, and remain 
during the winter; I think, nevertheless, that the bird is 
rather an uncommon one in this part of the county. — J, C

dry weather the windows of some of the upper rooms in his 
house were seldom closed. A robin took advantage of this 
circumstance to pry into one of the apartments, one which 
was seldom used, and, finding no opposition here, she began 
to build her nest in a festoon of the bed. It happened that, 
during the time of sitting, the gentleman's son came from 
school on a visit, and the bed was wanted; but this did not in 
the slightest degree disconcert the robin ; she seemed not in 
the least afraid, kept possession of her nest, and successfully 
reared her brood. The family, of course, felt interested in the 
bird's fate, and therefore as little disturbance as possible was 
given ; but one would have imagined that the mere fact of a 
person bringing a candle into the room, dressing and un- 
dressing, would have been sufficient to have effectually driven 
the creature away. — William Fowler, 4?9. Poland Sti^eet,

A Pair of the Greater Titmouse {Pdrus major) has built in 
a Pump (VI. 34. notes * and f ) ; exhibited seeming Foresight 
there (V. 660, 661.) ; and has had, there, a Nest of Young and 
a Nest of Eggs at the same Time. — A pair of this species occu- 
pied, last summer (1833), for the purpose of incubation, a 
pump standing in my yard. Their nests were placed between 
the barrel and the outside casing, and, as the pump was not 
in use during the summer, the birds were very rarely disturbed. 
The edges of the nests being on a level with the rim of the 
barrel of the pump, these little birds exhibited a degree of 
foresight equivalent to that which is related of a pair of this 
species in V. 660, 661., by filling the barrel with a mixture of 
moss, hair, &c., to prevent, no doubt, their young from pre- 
cipitating themselves into it. Some time previous to the first 
brood being able to fly, in fact, only a few days after they were 
hatched, the old birds commenced building a second nest on 
the opposite side ; in which, in due time, were deposited nine 
beautiful eggs, on which the female began to sit a day or two 
previous to the other brood leaving their domicile. From 
daily observation, I found that there was always an additional 
egg deposited early each morning, and although I often visited 
the old bird during the period of incubation, still she never 
offered to leave her nest, but merely puffed herself out, and 
exhibited every appearance of great irritation. This is the 
first instance of a pair of birds having a brood of young 
ones, and a nest of eggs at the same time, which has come 
under my observation, except the instances of this in the do-

Reptiles. — The Fascination of Birds by Reptiles has often 
been heard of. A curious instance of it was witnessed by a friend 
of mine, an officer in the Madras army (Lieut.-Col. Ross, then 
captain in the 10th Native Infantry), where the operator 
was not a snake, as is usual in such cases, but a crocodile, 
or, as we improperly call it in India, an alligator. My friend, 
while taking a stroll round the works at Vellore, had his atten- 
tion attracted by the strange restlessness and apparent distress 
of a kingfisher bird (^Icedo smyrnensis), perched upon one 
of the pinnacled battlements of the fausse-braye : on his 
cautiously approaching near enough to ascertain the cause, 
he observed in the ditch immediately underneath, a crocodile 
lying perfectly quiet in the water, and intently watching the 
bird with open jaws : in the mean time the victim's agitation 
continued to increase : it fluttered down to a projecting point 
of the works, then rapidly again and again farther and farther 
down, till at last it actually dropped into the gaping mouth 
waiting ready to receive it. Although I had this account at 
second hand only, I have not the slightest doubt of its truth.

Toads have the Power of compressing themselves so as to pass 
through a small Aperture. — Staying some time since with an 
acquaintance, his servant one day brought in, from an outhouse 
in the garden, an old tin canister which had been used for 
containing gunpowder, in which was composedly seated a very 
large toad of dimensions thrice the size of the aperture through 
which he must have entered. From his appearance, we con- 
cluded that he had located himself there in his younger days, 
and was now too large to extricate himself. The canister 
was placed carefully by, as an interesting exhibition to future 
visiters ; but, on an inspection of the canister in the following 
morning, the prisoner had made his escape ; and, as the mouth 
of the canister was in the same state as before, we could only 
account for the toad's absence on the supposition of the ani- 
mal's being able to squeeze itself through. Has this fact 
been noticed before ? It may, perhaps, help to explain some 
of the well-known instances of the occurrence of toads in 
apparently close prisons either of trees or rocks. [Some in- 
stances are given in VI. 458, 459.] — A. Dloxam. Rugby^

" A toad in a hole," is a proverbial expression, of which 
literal instances are not, I believe, rare in upland pastures. 
One was once, in 1832, and, I believe, in July, shown to me, 
the circumstances of which were these : — There was a circular 

L L 4« 



520 Short Communications ; '— 

aperture in the turf, scarcely 1 in. in diameter, below which 
the head and eyes of a toad were observable : its body was 
too much in the dark to be readily seen. This, it now occurs 
to me, was a very pleasant cool grot for a place of residence 
at this season. How long had the creature been there ? and 
upon what did it subsist ? As the earth and turf would yield 
to pressure, the toad could scarcely have, in this instance, 
squeezed itself in and out occasionally. Enough, possibly, of 
insects to sustain it might attempt to pass over the aperture 
and fall in. Earwigs, I have been told, are eaten by the toad. 
From what I learned from the companion who showed this 
instance to me, it seems to be the practice of the boys to irri- 
tate the toad which they find thus circumstanced by applying 
to it the end of a stiff straight straw, and provoking the 
toad to grasp it in its mouth, when they lift it up, although 
not, so far as I understood, out of its hole. — J. D. 

Fishes. — The Salmo7i e?iiers and asce?ids Rivers Jo?- other 
Purposes besides Propagation, (p. 211.) — In addition to the 
objections which I have offered, in p. 211. *, to the seeming 
doubt of Dr. Fleming, whether salmon enter rivers for any 
other purpose besides propagation, the following have come 
to mind ; and, though they do not apply to the salmon, they 
confirm me in the opinion that there are reasons, of which we 
know nothing, for fish ascending rivers, and others not at all 
connected with propagation. One is the habit of (what is here 
called) streaming. In the winter, the fish not engaged in 
spawning (I speak of trouts, grayling, chub, dace, &c.) leave 
the streams, and go into deep water ; either because the water 
is warmer there, or because they there find more food : and it 
is well known to fly-fishers that they do not catch many fish 
in the streams if they begin early, say in February. It is 
proverbial here, that fish begin stream when the great grey 
(in other districts, the devil dule crook, March brown, or 
brown drake [an insect]) comes upon the water ; and I have 
seen trout by scores leaping at a weir at the beginning of 
May. Whether this is in search of food, or an instinct 
implanted in them to keep all parts equally stocked with 
them, I do not know ; but it had certainly nothing to do with 

* In p. 213. line 15. for " to the side" read " to side." The phrase 
" to side" is a local one, probably, and ought to have been explained. 
It means that the salmon endeavours to conceal itself under a large stone, 
root, or any object which appears to offer it a shelter from its pursuers ; 
and it may be either at " the side " or in the middle. If there is no place 
of concealment in the pool, the poacher provides one, by placing the branch 
of a tree, M^ell covered with leaves, or with the rubbish left by the floods ; 
and the silly fish, seeing this, darts there for security, and is easily leis- 
tered [speared].

their spawning. Is it presumptuous to suppose that God, in 
his providence, has implanted this instinct in the salmon for 
our good ? that we might have a supply of excellent and 
wholesome food ; which, without this, would be in a great 
measure unattainable. Whether this is the true cause, and 
the only one, I am unable to determine ; but this is the effect 
produced : and, in the absence of other reasons, it is, in my 
opinion, one that ought to be admitted. 

Another reason why fish ascend rivers is, their impatience 
of heat : I speak now more particularly about grayling. If 
the weather is very hot at the end of May or the beginning 
of June, the grayling in the Wharfe (they are almost unknown 
in this part of the Ribble) ascend the mill-streams by hun- 
dreds, and go up the wheel-races as far as they can get; and 
stay there until the stoppage of the wheels (many a ducking 
have I had in pursuit of them), when they are obliged to 
beat a retreat : and this often proves a disastrous one to many 
of them. The ascent of young eels by millions, and the 
ascent of the flounder, are neither of them connected with the 
propagation of their kind ; and, though I cannot say for what 
purposes they do ascend, I am, I think, justified in doubting 
assertions which seem to have nothing to support them but 
the positive manner in which they are made. — T, G. Cli-

The Salmon Par is neither a Hybrid, nor a distinct Species, 
of the Genus Sdhno, but a State of the common Salmon . (p. 204.) 
— The author of Wild Sports of the West says, of the par (as 
I have noticed in p. 204.), that it has very much the appear- 
ance of a hybrid between the salmon and the trout ; and (in 
a note) that the natural history of this fish is doubtful. Some 
conjecture that it is a hybrid between the salmon and the 
trout, because it is only found in rivers frequented by salmon ; 
others think it a cross [breed] between the sea [trout] and 
river trout : and he speaks of this " hybridous diminutive " 
as if he thought one of these opinions correct. That the par 
is not the result of a cross between the sea trout and river 
trout is proved by the fact, that there are no sea trouts in the 
Wharfe; the salmon, par (admitting it to be a distinct spe- 
cies, which I do not), and trout being the only kinds of .Salmo 
which are found in that river, at least where I am acquainted 
with it. If the par be the result of a cross between the salmon 
and the trout, what becomes of it in the spring ? and where 
are all the par, which were so abundant in October, gone to 
in April ? Did they migrate to the sea, the shoals would be 
met with by somebody; and, did they stay in the river, tliey 
would be caught at one time or other. As, however, it is well

known that neither of these cases is ever realised, we must 
suppose another, which I have already done in my former 
communication, (p. 202 — 217.) In fact, in angling in the 
beginning of March, fish are often caught, which it would 
puzzle the most experienced fisherman to determine whether 
they are par or smelts, especially after they have been caught 
some time ; and, in a large number caught at that time, there 
are all the intermediate shades of appearance between the 
perfect par and the real hlue smelt. — Idem, 

Insects. — Extreme Cold does not destroy the Life in the 
Eggs, <$•€., of Insects ; "with some Facts on Lyccen2i dispar, — 
Mr. Browne relates some interesting facts (p. 246.) in proof 
of the little effect produced by extreme cold in destroying life 
in insect eggs.* The vulgar notion is (and a priori it seems 
a probable one), that a severe winter is destructive of insects ; 
and, consequently, that there will be fewer than usual during 
the succeeding summer. Experience, however, shows that 
this is not the case ; and that the scarcity or abundance of 
insects has little or nothing to do with the severity or mild- 
ness of the preceding winter. The fact is, insects, either in 
the egg, larva, pupa, or perfect state, are, in the ordinary 
course of things, liable to be exposed to severe cold ; and, 
therefore, nature has provided for them accordingly, endowing 
them with constitutions calculated to endure the degree of 
cold which they will have to encounter. It may be added, 
that these little creatures seem to be proof also against some 
other vicissitudes of nature less regular in their occurrence 
than the periodical returns of winter's cold. The following 
fact, communicated to me by the late Mr. Haworth, may 
serve as an illustration : — Some entomologists once made an 
excursion into the fen countries, for the purpose of taking the 
beautiful Lycae^n« dispar, or large copper butterfly ; which, it 
is well known, frequents low marshy grounds. The coppers 
were captured in good abundance. It so happened that the 
following winter proved to be a wet one ; and the entire tract 
of land where the coppers had been found w^as completely 
inundated, and actually lay under water for a considerable 
time. The entomologists deemed that the flood would cer- 
tainly destroy the coppers, and that the race would become 
extinct in that part of the country. The next summer, how- 
ever, the butterflies were found again, in the very same spot, 
as plentifully as before. Subsequently, as Mr. Haworth in-

formed me, the tract of land was submitted to the action of 
fire, and the whole surface burnt with a view to agricultural 
improvement. I need hardly add, that, after this operation, 
the coppers were no longer to be met with in that particular 
locality. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the natural 
history of the insect to say in what particular state the insect 
passes through the winter ; probably in the egg or larva state, 
as the butterfly appears in July. 

J'he earliest Vernal Apjpearance of certain Species of Butter- 
Jiy in Britain, (p. 249.) — Mr. Brown alludes (p. 249.) to my 
having instanced the 18th of March as the earliest date at 
which I had ever known a papilio issue from the chrysalis. 
This year an earlier instance presented itself. A small spe- 
cimen of Pontic rapae (P. Metra Stephens) was discovered in 
my scullery window on the 27th or 28th of February, evi- 
dently fresh from the chrysalis. Being introduced into the 
drawingroom by a very young entomologist, it was lost sight 
of for a few days ; so that I did not myself see it till the 3d 
of March, when it was again discovered and turned up. The 
same individual specimen, known by a peculiar mark on the 
wing, was observed flying about at large, in the garden, on 
the 15th of March. 

With respect to the Butterflies *iSohich appear in the early 
Spring (p. 247.), I am disposed to think that, with us, the 
majority of them are such as have been produced late in the 
autumn, and have survived the winter in the winged state. 
Mr. Brown is led to the conclusion that, in Switzerland, at 
least, " the early flight of Gonepteryx rhamni consists 
entirely of newly excluded males." I am not prepared to say 
that the case may not be the same also with this species here 
in England. Possibly, however, some of our early specimens 
may be such as have hybernated ; while others may have burst 
from the chrysalis in the spring. The earliest specimen of 
G. rhamni I observed in 1833 was on the 31st of March ; a 
female, which, from its worn condition, I should not judge to 
have been a newly excluded fly. I feel confident that Vanessa 
To, c. album, Polychloro^, and urticae hybernate, at least in 
this country. A winter seldom passes without an example or 
two of the latter insect being found in a half torpid state in 
our windows. If these insects be in good condition when they 
retire to rest in autumn, there will be but little wear and tear 
to injure their wings during their brumal retreat, and prevent 
them appearing fresh when they come forth again in spring. 
So far as my observation goes, the early specimens of Va- 
nessa generally seem somewhat faded in their colours, and to 
want the exquisite freshness and brilliancy of newly excluded

flies. Hipparchiflf Mghrm, Polyommatiis Argiolu5, VontXa

and some of them occasionally earlier, all assume the winged 
state in spring. But, with the single exception of Gonepteryx 
rhamni, the Vaness<^are thejirst butterflies that present them- 
selves in the season. CcMias Edusa is said to hybernate (see 
Lepidoptera Britamiica) ; and I think it highly probable, as 
well for other reasons as from having taken it in a perfectly 
fresh state so late as the 1st of October. But the species is 
so rarely met with in this part of the country, that I cannot 
speak, from my own experience, to its vernal appearances. 

Mr. Brown would be conferring a favour on myself, and, 
perhaps, on some other of your readers, if, through the me- 
dium of your Magazine, he would give a list of the papilios 
of Switzerland ; noting the times and places of their appear- 
ance, and their comparative scarcity or abundance. It hap- 
pens, I believe, with insects, as with plants, that some of the 
European species are less known in this country than those 
of South America, the West and East Indies, China, the 
Cape, &c. —W, T, Bree. Alledey Rectory, May 12. 1834.

he intended it for the true ?7^c6Uis ; as Mr. Babington, in

half, which is not the case in his figure of riiffico\X\s d. Mr.

black spot; " but, Mr. Westwood (VII. 379.) says, " of the 
extremity of the elytra, which thus appear to be appendi-

I have taken four individuals of a species nearer to ?w^c611is

red part of the elytra is scarcely so much [large] as in Panzer's

which approaches so near Mr. Babington's description, except 
the impression, that I had thought [VII. 178.] it was the 
same ; but I now find it to be distinct. I have taken three

alongside the boundary fence in the 
Park, and of the length of it. This 
northern boundary fence was, so 
lately as 1832, constituted in a cer- 
tain part by an old brick wall, now 
removed. The point atwhich the old wall commenced may 
be stated at about 300 yards west of Park Lane, and it

extended farther west, a length of about 150 yards : it was 
opposite the interval included between the street which leads 
off the Oxford Road into Connaught Square, and the Hano- 
ver Square burying-ground, and extended, perhaps, even a 
little farther west than the frontage of the burying-ground 
does. This length of wall was, in about August, 1832, 
taken down ; the foundation of it was cleared away, and 
a new wall, dwarfer, and surmounted by an iron palisade, 
has been erected in its site and stead, and uniform with the 
fence (using this term to imply both wall and palisade) which 
had been previously erected at each end of it. Of the trees 
contiguous to the specified length of wall, there are twenty- 
two (twenty elm trees, one oak tree, one ash tree), standing 
within from 5 ft. to 8 ft. of the foot of it. In digging out 
scope of access to the foundation of the old wall, in removing 
the old materials, and providing scope for the foundation of 
the new wall, it will be plain, on reflection, that no small in- 
jury must be occasioned to trees growing so near as this, from 
both the exposure and the mutilation to which their roots 
must be subject. The erection of the new fence was com- 
pleted in about October, 1832; when I presume that the 
soil was levelled down at its foot, and all left finished as we 
now find it. Of the twenty-two trees standing so near to the 
wall as I have stated, fourteen are now (Sept. 1834) so 
mortally affected that most of this number will, when their 
present leaves have fallen, never more bear others. The crop 
of leaves which they this year bear is a full one ; and to the 
passing eye their leafy heads exhibit so little dissimilarity to 
those of the neighbouring trees, that, up to August 22., I had 
not observed, in passing them occasionally, any difference in 
their condition. On this day my attention was drawn, in 
passing, to first one, and then another of them, by the buzz- 
ing and the bustling of numerous large flies upon and about 
the stems of some of them. Since that time I have examined 
the trees several times, and acquired the following facts and 
notions respecting them. The bark of fourteen of them (all 
elm trees) has been perforated by the Scolytus destructor ; 
the perforations in some of them are rather numerous, but in 
nearly all of them have been made by the parent female 
Scolyti, to effect their ingress for the purpose of depositing 
their eggs. The holes of ingress made from without by the 
entering female Scolyti are usually most readily distinguish- 
able from those made from within by the Scolyti developed 
from the introduced eggs in gnawing their way out; those 
made by the former are larger, less uniform in figure, and 
less definite in outline, than those made by the latter : the 



Insects,

former have, too, not rarely a powdery matter, derived from 
the gnawed bark, discernible near them. I premise this for 
the sake of stating that the perforations observable in nearly 
all the foiirteea trees have been made this summer by entering 
parent Scolyti ; and I say " nearly all the fourteen," to pre- 
clude it being objected that a few of the perforations to be 
found upon two or three of the trees have been made by 
Scolyti making egress from within in a previous season. About 
fifty larvae it seems {Jig. 63, b, c) are hatched from the quantity 
of eggs introduced by a single parent Scolytus, and as every 
perfect Scolytus which is developed from these larvae gnaws, 
for its own egress, a distinct hole, plenty of these holes may 
be expected to be visible after May, in 1835. {Jig, 64.)

sides being perforated by the 
parent Scolyti, have been sub-

sation of sap : this, one is led 
to perceive, by observing the ac- 
tions of the flies so abundant, as 
noticed above, upon the surface 
of the bark of the stems and 
larger bi'anches. Those of the 
flies which are alive are busily 
occupied in licking the sap from 
the natural fissures of the bark, 
from larger openings in it occa- 
sioned by past wounds or de- 
fects, and some, also, it is right 
to state, from the orifices of the 
perforations made by the parent 
Scolyti. Those of the flies which are dead are, however, 
more numerous than the living ones, and they adhere, in the 
posture of life, over all parts of the bark of the trees, here 
scatteredly, there in clusters in the neighbourhood of some 
opening which had yielded an effusion of sap, and they are 
in all stages of decay, from those fresh dead, to those with 
loosened wings shaken by the breeze, to those without wings, 
and those a mere whitened mass, in which scarcely the form 
of a fly remains. There were some dead flies attached to the 
under surface of a few of the leaves. The flavour of the sap 
is, to my taste, much that of slightly sugared water, and it is 
probable that the great number of flies which have died here 
have died of repletion, rather than of any poisonous property 
in this sap taken by them as food. Of the clusters of flies, 
it should be observed, that there were also some clusters or 




528 Short Communications: — 

groups of living ones, where the wound in the bark was large 
enough to admit a group to pasture together. Nearly the 
whole of the flies were of the common blow-fly species (Musca 
vomitoria), but a not uncommon brassy-green species was 
there, and another small species or two, and a few wasps, and 
always one or more hornets : at one time I saw three, and I 
think four, of the latter animal. Of the seven trees into 
which the parent Scolyti had perforated, out of which the sap 
had extravasated, and upon which the flies, wasps, and hornets 
have been and are (Sept. 10.) feasting, I think I may state 
that, although their leaves are not, as I have already stated, 
strikingly dissimilar to those upon neighbouring healthy trees, 
they yet, to a close inspection, seem somewhat flaccid and 
drooping, and as if tending to earlier sereness than those of 
their neighbours. 

To return to the Scolytus. Those who will have it that 
this poor pretty little beetle is the formidable foe to healthy 
living trees, and to the interests and wishes of man, that it 
is represented to be, have now, to account for the facts I have 
stated, it seems to me, only to say, that " the perforations of 
the Scolytus induced the extravasation of the sap, and the per- 
forations and the extravasation have brought the trees into 
the dying condition in which you describe them to be.'* To 
this conclusion, should any one incline to it, there are these 
objections : — First, as to Scolytus perforating heahhy trees at 
all ; none of the healthy trees neighbouring to those whose 
roots have been, as I have argued, injured, are at all per- 
forated. And, were it admitted that the Scolytus does perforate 
hito healthy growing trees, and occasion their death, it would 
surely be too much to admit that the symptoms of mortality 
would be induced, in trees healthy and growing, within the 
very same year or season in which the perforations were made. 
The erosions of the numerous larvae (which, it is said in IV, 
152., are hatched, in September, from the eggs introduced by 
the perforating parent in June and July) subsisting upon the 
inner bark, and, perhaps, alburnum, of the tree, and eating 
their way out, might induce, in the year following, death in- 
deed. Under this view, the particular trees I have cited, 
should live through, at least part of, 1835, which I anticipate 
they will not. Next, as to the perforations of the Scolytus 
inducing the extravasation of sap. The period at which the 
parent Scolytus bores into trees is intimated, in IV. 152., to 
be June and July. From the decayed state of the remains 
of some of the dead flies observed on August 22., it is not 
too much to infer, that the flies had drunk of the sap of the 
trees by about this time, and that, this admitted, it was effused

to them, independently of the efFects of the perforations of 
the Scolyti. Again, of the fourteen trees perforated by Sco- 
lyti, although seven show extravasation of sap, the remaining 
seven do not show it at all. 

" Give a dog an ill name and hang him." I cannot help 
thinking that the Scolytus is deserving of much more respect 
than is bespoken for it in the epithet destructor; and I had, in 
this belief, called it, in my own vocabulary, insons, as early as 
in the index to Vol. IV. — J. D. 

The Hornets (Vespa Crabro, fig, QS.)^ spoken of above, 
fed upon the sap with diligence and earnestness. One, that I 

observed more than once, 
kept its head partly immersed 
in a crevice for a long time 
together. The wedge-shaped 
figure of the lower part of 
the head causes it to fit a 
crevice aptly ; and then the 
lateral action of the mandi- 
bles, if these be used in feed- 
ing upon sap (some of the 
sap was of a pulpy consist- 
ence), in such a situation, 
must be very convenient 
indeed. Of the flies, eager to share every good, some would 
gather about any of the hornets to partake of the feast it had 
found, and, in their eagerness, prove too intrusive; when the 
hornet would lash them with its antennae to drive them off (and, 
thought I, this is at least one use of antennae, about the office 
of which entomologists have never been agreed). When this 
would not do, the hornet would leave off feeding, and run a 
few steps at the flies, open-mouthed : the flies scampered away 
quickly. The hornet's mouth almost frightened me, and well 
it might the flies. I found, too, that the flies had real reason 
to be a little fearful; for I saw two instances of a fly being in 
the jaws of a hornet. In one, the hornet was alighting, I 
think, v^ith the fly in its mouth (if not, it captured it on alight- 
ing) ; and, curving its body round the fly, as if to prevent its 
escape, and while itself hanging but by a single toe (as one 
might say), bit off the fly's head, whose body fell to the 
ground. It may be right here to note, that the heads and 
bodies of flies were somewhat numerous upon the ground, at 
the foot of the trunks of the trees ; but I suppose that these, 
or most of these, were fallen portions of some of the nume- 
rous dead flies which were sticking over the surface of the 
bark. The other instance was this : — A hornet flew down 
Vol. VIT. — No. 42. mm 




530 Short Comnnmications : — 

with a fly in Its hold ; and, after standing still a moment, tlien 
walking over the grass with it, mangling it the while, it flew 
off" with it. The hornets seemed to be on good terms with 
each other : it was a clear case of " parcit cognatis maculis 
similis fera." Of 

Wasps here, although there were some, there were scarcely 
so many as one might expect to find at such a banquet. It is 
not unlikely that, had an entomologist been present, he would 
have noted more species than one. I observed one small one 
with its abdomen so pubescent as to seem almost hoary with 
it. As a wasp flew round a tree, the flies flew up ; and I 
thought that they did this more to a wasp than a hornet. 
Was this from fear ? Had it been from the vibration caused 
by the wasp's or hornet's wings, it would have been done most 
to the hornet; but my observation did not extend to a suffi- 
cient number of instances. — J. Z). 

The Dung Fly dead in the Posture of Life. (61.) — I have, 
for many years, observed, in August and September, flies of 
this species fixed in the manner Mr. Fennell mentions, in 
p. 61., upon the leaves of a lilac tree near to the door of a 
convenient outbuilding in my garden. They are, however, 
invariably fixed by the proboscis alone, which seems to be 
agglutinated to the leaf: every other part is free. I have 
never found one so fixed which had any life remaining in it. 
They are all precisely in the same attitude ; and are covered 
with the mould Mr. Fennell mentions. I have at times 
removed all I could discover; but found them replaced, on 
the morrow, by others equally mouldy, and in similar atti- 
tudes. Although I have watched, I have never been able to 
discover one in the act of affixing itself; and have often 
puzzled myself with attempting to discover the object nature 
has in view by causing this fly to terminate its existence in so 
singular a manner. As nature does nothing without an object, 
I should presume that there is some reason why this particular 
fly should die, and be fixed, in this manner, instead of ter- 
minating its existence like other flies. — Thos, Thompson, 
Hull, Ja7u 9. ISS^. 

{Flies, of various Species, dead in the Posture of Life. (61.)] 
— This condition is not peculiar to the dung fly. I have often 
seen the house fly in its natural posture, on the windows, 
dead, and covered with the same sort of white substance as 
that to be found on the dead dung flies. This last does not, 
under the microscope, present any peculiar appearance. I 
have not been able to quite satisfy myself whether it is a 
fungus growing on the dead animal, or is produced by dis- 
ease. — iS. T. S. Feb. 17. J 834. 



Insects, 531 

E. T. S. seems not to have observed the dung fly's being 
affixed by its proboscis only, as Mr. Thompson has. In 
Kirby and Spencers Introd. (ed. 1826), iv. 203., mention is 
made of " several specimens of a fly related to Eiimerus 
pipiens Meig.^'^ which, dead, adhered by their proboscis to a 
panicle of grass. I know of one fact, which may or may not 
have a relation to the explanation of this ; — Among the flies 
which I have noticed above (p. 527.), as abounding dead upon 
the bark of the elm trees, I noticed, at two different times, 
two live flies (it might, possibly, be one seen twice), whose 
condition may afford some relevance of this question : per- 
haps, however, none at all. Though alive, they seemed in 
an incipiently morbid state ; but were capable of flying off* 
when approached very close. At the tip of the proboscis of 
each, there was a globule of transparent whitish fluid ; the 
globule was not larger than the head of a pin, and appeared, 
disappeared, and reappeared at least once, perhaps more. I 
leave this fact without an attempt to account for it; but have 
cited it, in the thought that cases may happen where this 
regurgitated fluid may, in the fly's dying, and the proboscis 
falling into contact with an object, gum it to that object. It 
is, however, right to state, that, in the countless instances of 
flies dead in the posture of life, adhering to the surface of the 
bark of the elms, I did not see one attached by its proboscis 
only ; and, I think, not one with its proboscis attached at all. 
They all rested upon their legs and upon the terminal half of 
their abdomen, which was, in some degree, and by some 
means, affixed to the bark ; and, in cases not a few, plainly 
by means of a whitish matter that seemed to have erupted 
from the last few rings of the body on the ventral surface. 
Fibres of mould seemed, in some cases, to have farther 
affixed the abdomen to the bark ; and the dorsal surface of 
the posterior part of the abdomen wore, at least, in some 
points of light, a glaucous hue. In other dead flies, in a 
more advanced state of decay, increased degrees of whiteness 
were obvious ; produced either from an increase in the quan- 
tity of mould or of the erupted matter : and this was accom- 
panied by some distortion of the component parts of the fly, 
which were enlarged, and made to seem farther asunder and 
less compactly connected. See farther in p. 527. 

In the latter part of 1833, Mr. Fennell sent us two flies, 
found dead, I think in the posture of life, upon a plant; and 
these, Mr. Westwood informed us, were individuals " of a 
species of Anthomyia ; " and that they had " died of tlie 
disease which Messrs. Kirby and S})ence call plethora. (///- 
irod. fed. 1826], iv. 202.) The circumstance is of verycom- 



532 Short Communications ; — 

mon occurrence." In these flies there was not (so far as 1 
remember) any sign of transfusion or eruption of juices; and, 
perhaps, as flies are sometimes poisoned, it may not be very 
unreasonable to suppose symptoms of an eruption of juices to 
mark death from plethora ; and non-appearance of eruption, 
death from poison. The following case, judged by this 
assumed rule, may be one of death from poison : — Mr. 
Godsall, nurseryman, of Hereford, has observed the pavement, 
under a blooming plant of Periploca grae^ca, to be literally 
covered with dead flies, of the species of Miisca domestica; 
and, at the same time, a great quantity of the same species 
swarming and settling on the blossoms of the same plant. 
He attributes, in consequence, some quality deleterious to 
flies to the flowers of this plant. {Garde?ier's Magazine, Ix. 586.)

iHabits of the Macroglossa stellatdrum observed, July, 1833, 
at Little Hampton, on the Coast of Sussex. (4-75.)] — There is, 
in front of the beach houses, a piece of sandy heath, of some 
acres in extent, which forms a very agreeable promenade for 
the visiters. I here observed the humming-bird hawk moth ; 
not one only here and there, but numbers dashing about in 
various directions. The first I captured was hovering over a 
flower, and extracting the nectar from it with its curiously 
long tubular proboscis. They frequented much a stone wall 
at the end of Lord Surrey's grounds, along which they were 
constantly flying, and apparently examining it with great 
attention. As there were no flowers there, I was at a loss to 



Insects. 533 

discover what their object was in so industriously haunting 
this spot. They were not depositing eggs ; for tliis operation 
I saw the female moth perform in a different place. On the 
heath there are many heaps of stones, and the insect, poising 
itself on its wings over them, with a slight bend of the body, 
deposited her eggs on a species of Galium (probably the G. 
saxatile) which springs up between the stones, and on which 
plant the larvae feed. This moth, from its resdess habits, is 
not very readily caught; it dashes off the instant you approach ; 
but, by stationing yourself near a flower it frequents, and, 
remaining perfectly still, it will come close [see VI. 223.], and 
enable you to see its long proboscis, which, except when feed- 
ing, is always curled up. Like many other insects, it counter- 
feits death ; but, the instant an opportunity offers for escape, 
it never fails to take advantage of it. — O. Clapton, January, 
1834. 

Tortrix viridana on the Foliage of Oak Trees. (V. 669. 
753.) — The oak woods in the Beulah grounds at Norwood 
have, for the last three years, suffered from this insect ; and, 
besides the beauty of the foliage not being restored until 
past midsummer, the growth of the oaks has, of course, been 
greatly retarded. — J. D. Smith. Beulah Park, Norwood, 
Jan. 9. 1833. 

A writer in the Gardener's Magazi?ie (v. 610.) describes the 
ravages, in June, 1829, of an immense number of insects of 
this species, on the foliage of a fine coppice of natural oak, in 
the mountains beyond Machynlleth in Wales. 

Sir William Jardine, in his edition of White's Selborne, 
p. 114-., states that this insect, *' while in the larva state, does 
considerable damage to the young oak copses in Scotland ; " 
and he names, as places, " about Inverary, and near Loch 
Katrine." White himself has accurately spoken on this 
insect and its habits and ravages, but by the name of Pha- 
lae^na quercus. Markwick, in his notes on the Histoi'y of 
Selborne, has shown the identity of the Phalae^ia quercus of 
White with the Phalae^na (Tortrix) viridana of authors. He 
supplies, too, additional facts on the insect's habits. In 
Brown's edition of White's Selborne (noticed VL 133.)j Mark- 
wick's identification is printed in p. 311., and not disputed ; 
and yet a cut (not a good one) of the Phalae^na quercus (La- 
siocampa quercus) is introduced into the text (in p. 310,). A 
cut of the Tortrix viridana would surely have been more 
judicious, useful, and correlative, either alone, to the exclusioi. 
of that of the Phalae^na quercus, for the sake of illustrating 
the text and note, or in company with that of the Phalee'na

quercus, both for the sake of illustrating the text and note, 
and of exhibiting the two insects contradistinctorily. 

These remarks on synonymy adjusted, it will be fair to 
exhibit the question, which arboriculturists have not omitted 
to propose, — By what means can the extensive and injurious 
ravages on the leaves of oak trees, &c., of the larva? or cater- 
pillars of the Tortrix viridana be prevented ? A question 
worthy of answer. With regard to the perfect insect, White 
observes, " I saw a flight of swifts busied in catching their 
prey near the ground, and found they were hawking after 
these phalaense;" that is, moths of the Tortrix viridana. — J. Z>.

The Lacejly {Chrysbpa Perla L.) attaches its pedunadated 
Eggs to ahnost any Object, — Many years since, I met with a 
group of them on a twig, cut off, dead, and lying on the 
ground, of a gooseberry bush. In the summer of this year 
(1833), numerous groups of the eggs have been disposed 
upon the leaves and branches of a large hop plant growing by 
my place of abode. One group was affixed to the painted 
surface of a wooden eaves' water-spout ; another to the under 
surface of the leaf of a plant of passion flower. I did not 
happen to see (for I did not search) any ^g^ before about 
July 4., although I had seen a pair of perfect chrysopas on 
about June 26. The eggs were to be met with through July 
and August. The first hatched eggs which I saw were seen 
on July 15. For information on the habits of the insects of 
this genus, see Samouelle's Entomological Cabinet, No. ii. ;

The preceding paragraph, (which has been long in type) 
does but tell a fact probably most familiarly known to those 
experienced in the ways of insects. We may perhaps safely 
connect with it a general inference to the extent that all in- 
sects employ, indifferently, any mechanical object for a merely 
mechanical end. A Syrphus, most probably S. balteatus, as it 
is near the same hop plant off which we obtained this species 
in 1833 (see p. 184.), is now sticking to the inner face of the 
door of an outbuilding close by the hop plant. Six cocoons 
of the 2Jygse'na loti, kindly sent us by E. Wilson, jun. (see 
above), are attached, three to portions of the stem of an 
umbelliferous plant ; two, each to the branch, near the flower- 
head, of Centaur^a nigra ; and one to the culm of a ^r^mus.

Botany and Geology. — Affinities betweefi Plants and 
subjace7it Rocks. (VI. '635. 424.; VII. 274.)— Mr. Cau- 
treil (VII. 274.) says that he believes the foxglove (Digitalis 
purpurea) never grows upon limestone ; and from this I pre- 
sume that he infers the affinity between geological stratum and 
botanical productions. Before I refer to the second part of 
this subject, however, it is necessary that I should say, that 
here the foxglove grows abundantly upon the limestone. I 
am situated just on the verge of the great South Wales coal- 
field : in the hills to the west that coalfield terminates, 
bounded by a very narrow band of mountain limestone, to 
this succeeds the old red sandstone, which I call the strata of 
the district; and a mile or two to the east, the transition 
limestone shows itself, running nearly north and south, from 
within a few miles of Caerleon to Clyther House, a distance 
of about fifteen miles. When I read Mr. Cautrell's remark, 
I determined to put the fact to the test, and consequently 
took a day's walk over a part of this limestone district ; and 
I can now assert, that, in this limestone district (transition 
limestone), the foxglove grows luxuriantly and abundantly, 
as it does likewise in every other part of my neighbourhood. 

With regard to the peculiarity of certain botanical pro- 
ductions to certain geological districts, I think that this must 
be a matter of some doubt; at least, the evidence which I at 
present j)ossess is not sufficient to confirm me in the belief of 
the fact. For instance, I call my locality the old red sand- 
stone district ; and, undoubtedly, that rock is the substratum 

M ai 4 



536 Short Co:mnunicaliuns : — . 

of the whole neighbourhood ; but it is traversed by innumer- 
able little rivulets, whose valleys are formed of the alluvium 
which they bring down. Again, some of the eminences 
which divide these valleys are evidently formed of diluvial 
gravel, bearing indubitable traces of having been transported 
to their present positions from the rock that overlies the coal. 
Then we have abundance of cold, wet, spongy bog, which 
lies upon a yellow, sandy, stiff, and, as the farmers argue, 
poisonous clay : and, finally, we have considerable quantities 
of peat. Now, in arranging a flora of my neighbourhood 
according to its geological strata, I should find some dif- 
ficulty; for, surely, I am not to reckon all those flowers which 
grow in the bogs, on the peat, upon the gravel, and in the 
rich alluvial meadows, as belonging to the old red sandstone 
formation. Bog plants, peat plants, and meadow plants are, 
I presume, nearly the same, whatever may be the substratum 
upon which those bogs, meadows, or peat districts may rest; 
and if this be the case, then it is the superincumbent soil, 
more than the substratum of rock upon which that soil rests 
(modified, of course, and considerably affected, by elevation 
and climate), that gives the character to the botanical pro- 
ductions of any district. The old red sandstone also forms 
considerable hills, in fact, mountains. Am I, therefore, be- 
cause these mountains are formed of the old red sandstone, 
to call the alpine plants, which grow upon them, the pro- 
ductions of the old red sandstone ? 

As I am upon the subject of plants, 1 would say a few 
words upon 

Plants with White Flowers, lists of which have been given 
in many parts of this Magazine [I. 392, 393.; II. 268.; 
III. 161. 190.], and which lists I could augment, by the 
account of the like productions in this locality. Mr. Edwin 
Lees (III. 190.) endeavours to account for the deviation in 
colour, from a variety of soil or shade, or from accidental 
manuring of the root of the plant. That these circumstances 
may affect the colour of flowers, I will not deny; but I think 
they are not sufficient to account for the white blossoms which 
sometimes appear. Last year, for instance, I found but one 
hyacinth (^Scilla nutans) with white blossoms ; this year I found 
twenty-four specimens, in less than half an hour, without 
scarcely giving myself the trouble of looking for them. In- 
deed, the present season, as far as it has already advanced, 
has been unusually rich in flowers with white blossoms. The 
hyacinths of which I have spoken were, in every instance, sur- 
rounded with a profusion of others of the usual colour. But 
what has decided me in rejecting the explanation offered, as 



Plants, 5'J1 

an insufficient cause for the effect produced, is, that I last 
year gathered specimens of ling (Calliina vulgaris), some of 
which I have still by me, in which the flowers on one part 
were white, while, on other parts, they were of the usual 
colour ; and these various-coloured flowers grew upon dif- 
ferent branches of the same plant, the produce of one root. 
This specimen was exposed to the same light and shade, and 
to the same degree of drought and moisture, as all the other 
ling, which grew so abundantly about it ; and, certainly, I 
think it is impossible that any accidental manuring, which 
would affect its root, could cause the flowers of one part of 
the stem to take a different hue from those of another : any 
such cause must have affected the whole plant alike. —

scended to the regions below; not where Orpheus went in 
search of his Eurydice, but only to the secondary formation 
of the earth. To give, however, an account of all the strata 
we passed through, the angles of the rocks, and the point of 
the compass they dip to, and of the dikes, troubles, and faults 
that are met with in the coal formation, would be to write 
an article on geology. We descended a pit fifty-five fathoms 
deep ; and when we had arrived at the bottom, we 

" Glower'd about wi' canny care. 
Lest bogles catch us unaware." 

The passage for our feet was sometimes rough, sometimes 
smooth ; that for our back and head, sometimes high, some- 
times low. In some places, as we went along, we saw 

" Where, gloomily retir'd. 
The villain spider lives, cunning and fierce." 

with his net spread out to entrap his unsuspecting victims. 
We think the spider was of the species ^ranea labyrinth ica. 
We thought that it had " come to the goat's house to thig 
woo' ; " but, as we proceeded, several species of Tipi^lidae were 
seen : these would, no doubt, occasionally come into the net; 
and the fine feeling of the ^ranea would, in the dark, be as 
good as eyes. We met with beautiful specimens of the Raco- 
dium ccUarc, as white as snow : whether this was owing to 



538 Short Commu?itcaliotis : — 

the want of light, or whether it was, rather, a different species, 
we will not venture to determine. Several of the Polypori 
were seen on wooden posts which supported part of the roof. 
Having proceeded about half a mile, we came to the banks 
of a beautiful stream, clear as crystal, cool, and refreshing ; 
and, although its banks were not adorned with velvet moss 
and fragrant flowers, they were far from being unadorned; 
for there the lichens were spread in pleasing forms, inter- 
mixed with the oxide of iron oozing from the metallic stra- 
tum. We were much in need of ablution, after passing 
through such a blackened region. We were now to travel 
up the stream ; but, before entering it, it was thought neces- 
sary to rest a little, that our bodies might acquire a cooler 
temperature ; for the sweat was pouring copiously off" us. We 
supplied our lamps with oil, and trimmed their wicks. The 
light had a pleasing effect upon the numerous water-drops 
suspended from the roof: these, mingling with the iron 
pyrites, had the appearance of diamonds set in gold. When 
we went into the water, it felt very cold ; but, after wading 
for a quarter of an hour, we began to be more reconciled to 
it, and to resume our observations. In some places the 
water was contracted, and ran with great force ; in other 
places it was more shallow : it appeared as if it had its floods, 
like other streams ; for there were large sandbanks in 
several places, on which could be seen the recent footsteps of 
the otter (Z/iitra vulgaris Flem.), How otters manage to 
procure their food in the dark, we know not ; but one thing 
is certain, there are fish in the stream, particularly the eel 
(^nguilla vulgaris Flem.). The otter had fled at our ap- 
proach ; for the noise that we made was tremendous ; our 
plunging in the water echoed through the gloomy wastes, 
like the roar of the ocean in a storm. In some parts, the 
roof rose to the height of 20 ft., and from it hung beautiful 
stalactites ; in other parts its height was only from 3 ft. to 
4 ft. ; and, in one place, which was about 60 ft. or 70 ft. long, 
we had to proceed on all fours, wdth scarcely room for our 
head between the water and the roof. Our lights, during 
our passage through this part, were placed upon our heads, 
to preserve them from being extinguished. After clearing 
this narrow passage, we soon arrived at the place where the 
plant which we were in search of grows. We got it in tufts 
attached to old wood in the water. After procuring some 
fine specimens of it, we began to retrace our steps, well 
pleased with our journey, and hoping, at some future period, 
to make more extensive researches in these interesting ex- 
cavations. By the lielp of the Encyclopaedia of Plants^ we 



Geology, Meteorology, 539 

have, we think, identified the plant as the Vauch^r/a dicho- 
toma. Some of the specimens measured between 20 ft. and 
30 ft. M. Vaucher, 1 dare say, would not have shunned 
such an immersion as we got, to have seen such fine plants.

not containing any shells, but mixed with small pebbles, of 
what depth is not yet known. The bones are probably those 
of the fossil elk (Cervus megaceros) : among them there is a

of the mountain, it stood at 40°. This was at noon. The

Cats possess the Faculty of imitating the Voice of Birds, for 
the Purpose of Enticement. — This is an interesting fact ; which, 
as far as I know, has not been noticed in any work on natural 
history. It has been previously observed during my life ; but 
I have at present a young cat, which, placing herself on the 
window-seat, and watching intently the birds, utters a chirping 
chirruping sound, bearing a close resemblance to the note of 
the sparrows, accompanied by a peculiar tremulous motion of 
the under jaw. It is undoubtedly one of those marvellous 
methods which the wisdom of the Creator, who " gives to all 
their meat in due season," has devised for bringing the prey 
within their reach. That it has not been commonly remarked, 
may be ascribed to the successful ventriloquism of the per- 
former. Although some highly accomplished cats have been 
lately exhibited in the metropolis, people are sceptical as to 
their musical talents ; so I should be glad to have my state- 
ment corroborated by some correspondent. — A Bachelor, 
Lincolnshire, March 24. 1834. [We have noticed, in young 
cats pursuing a bird in a tree, &c., a tremulous motion of the 
under jaw ; accompanied by the utterance of a faint cry, yet 
one denotive of intense anxiety, and, with the gesture, express- 
ing the sentiment, " Come, let me clutch thee ! " In the cry, 
however, we have never been struck with a resemblance to 
the note of a bird.] 

The Water Ouzel. (II. 301. 400., V. 734.; and its song, 
VII. 183.) — The water ouzel does sing very frequently, and 
as much in the winter as at any time. Perched on a stone or 
a piece of ice, it chirps away at a famous rate ; but its song 
consists almost entirely of its note zeet zeet, which it hashes 
up in all sorts of ways : lengthening and shortening ; now a 
crotchet, then a semiquaver ; raising an octave or so, and 
then descending again ; it makes as much of it as can be 
made. But, with all its efforts, its song is a very so-so affair ; 
all its syllables beginning with z, and almost ending with it 
too. Yet, although it is not much of a songster, it is almost 
a sacred bird with me, in consequence of the associations 
connected with it. A pair built for forty years, according to 
tradition, in a wheel-race near to where I was born ; and had 
never been molested by any body, until a gentleman in the 
neighbourhood, who was a great ornithologist, employed his 



Queries and Answers. 541 

gamekeeper to shoot this pair. I think that the natives of 
Calcutta were not more indignant when an unlucky English- 
man got one of their sacred bulls into his compound, and 
baited him, than was our little community at what we con- 
sidered so great an outrage. The gamekeeper narrowly 
escaped being stoned by myself and some more lads; any of 
whom would have shot fifty blackbirds or fieldfares without 
any misgivings. 

Mr. Dovaston*s remark, in II. 400., that this bird resembles 
the wren in its habits and motions, is strikingly correct : it 
nods and curtsies, and cocks its tail, in exactly the same man- 
ner. Its nest, also, is similar in form to that of the wren. 

As some correspondents say that it is impossible for the 
water ouzel to walk at the bottom of the water, owing to its 
being of less specific gravity, I Y*^ill not argue the point with 
them ; but, disbelieving my own eyes, endeavour to submit 
with a good grace : otherwise, I should have said that I have 
repeatedly seen it doing so from a situation where I had an 
excellent opportunity of observing it, the window of a build- 
ing directly over the place where it was feeding. It walked 
in, began to turn over the pebbles with its bill, rooting almost 
like a pig ; and it seemed to have no difficulty whatever in 
keeping at the bottom, at all depths where I could see it : 
and I have frequently observed it when the water just covered 
it, and its head appeared above every time it lifted it up, 
which it did incessantly ; turning over a pebble or two, then 
lifting its head, and again putting it below to seize the creepers 
[larvae of insects] it had disturbed. Besides, its speed was 
too slow for diving. Every aquatic bird with which I am 
acquainted moves much faster when diving than when either 
swimming or walking, and its course is generally in a straight 
line, or nearly so ; but the water ouzel, when feeding, turns 
to the right or left, or back again to where it started ; stops 
and goes on, just as it does when out of the water. Yet, 
when it wished, it seemed to have the power of altering its 
own gravity ; as, after wading about two, or perhaps five, 
minutes, where it could just get its head out, it would sud- 
denly rise to the surface and begin to swim, which it does 
quite as well as the water hen. The awkward, tumbling, 
shuffling wriggle, which Mr. Dovaston speaks of [II. 400.], 
is occasioned by the incessant motion of its head as it turns 
over the gravel in search of creepers ; which, it appears to me, 
form the whole of its food. 

Sir George Mackenzie says, or seems to think, that these 
birds destroy salmon spawn ; which, if correct, would go far 
towards putting an end to my partiality for them : but I rather 



542 Queries and Answers, 

think that they are unjustly accused in this instance, and 
believe that they were catching creepers when he supposed 
they were eating spawn. If this were the case (and it is a 
fact well worth ascertaining), they were rendering an essential 
service to the fisheries, when he supposed they were injuring 
them, because these creepers (the larvae of the May fly, bank 
fl}^, and all the drakes) are exceedingly destructive to "spawn- 
ing beds : and, as the water ouzel feeds on them at all other 
times, and as they are more abundant in the winter than at 
any other season, I think this is the more probable supposi- 
tion. Of course, if he has shot the bird, and speaks from 
knowledge after dissecting it, there can be no doubt of the 
fact ; but, if he merely supposes it so, because the water ouzel 
feeds in the same streams where the salmon are spawning, it 
is very probable that he is mistaken, for the reasons before 
mentioned. — T. G. Clitheroe, Lancashire, May 29. 1834. 

The Water Ouzel; its Song (VII. 183.), and Nest (II. 
400.): in reply to the query in VII. 183. — I answer, un- 
hesitatingly, that it has a very sweet song. I live in a 
neighbourhood where water ouzels are common ; so common, 
indeed, that it would be difficult to pursue any stony stream- 
let a couple of miles, without observing several of them. 
Their song is rapid and vigorous ; continued often two or three 
minutes at a time ; and, to my ear, resembling a good deal, 
in its execution, the song of the wren ; from which it, how- 
ever, differs materially in this respect, that it is not charac- 
terised by a loud shrillness, but by a certain subdued and 
warbly richness. The water ouzel never sings more sweetly 
than on a bright frosty-aired morning in January or February. 

A word or two on its nest. This is generally affixed to 
some rough moist rock or bank, rising perpendicularly from 
a river's margin. In bulk, I should say, it was nearly the 
size of a hat ; in shape, more or less semicircular, with a firm 
compact sloping roof made of moss ; beneath which, as under 
eaves, and completely concealed from the sight, is the en- 
trance, a hole just large enough to allow the bird free ingress 
and egress. The apartment within is domed and commo- 
dious; and invariably lined with withered oak leaves, in which 
I find deposited commonly five white eggs, remarkable for 
their brittleness, transparency, and purity. Once I found a 
water ouzel's nest among some slender boughs overhanging a 
stream ; and once beneath a waterfall, at a point where the 
rock retreated a little in the middle ; the water falling in a 
sheet just over the nest, and forming, as it were, a kind of 
crystal veil to it. Indeed, the eaves of the nest (as I call 
them) were always dripping xvet; whereas the oak lining

within remained always perfectly dry. The art with which 
this nest was accommodated to its situation was consummate: 
no one could have possibly discovered it but by the bird. —

Art. I. Notices of certain Omens and Superstitions connected mth 
Natural Objects. By the Rev. W. T. Bree, M.A. 

Observing, in a former Number (V. 209.), an essay of 
Mr. J. C. Farmer's, entitled, " Contributions towards an 
account of omens and superstitions connected with natural 
history," I venture to add a few similar instances, which have 
come under my own observation, in the hope that they may 
prove not unacceptable ; and the more so, as Mr. Farmer 
invites others to follow his example. Many of these super- 
stitious fancies are, I take it, of great antiquity; and, of some 
of them, it is, perhaps, next to impossible to trace the origin. 
But I am not going to write a treatise on the subject, but 
merely to give a few examples in point. 

The Cat.* — Sailors, as I am informed on the authority of 
a naval officer, have a great dislike to see the cat, on board 
ship, unusually playful and frolicsome: such an event, they 
consider, prognosticates a storm ; and they have a saying on 

* " Tlie cat is the s'mc qua non of a witch." Warburton, on the pas- 
sage in Macbeth, 

" Thrice the brindled cat hath mew'd," 
observes, that a cat, from time immemorial, has been the agent and 
favourite of witches. This superstitious fancy is pagan, and very ancient ; 
and the original, perhaps, this : — When Galinthia was changed into a cat 
by the Fates (says Antonius Liberalis, Meiani., c. xxix.), by witches 
(says Pausanias, in his Bceotics), Hecate took pity of her, and made her 
her priestess ; in which office she continues to this day. Hecate herself, 
too, when Typhon forced all the gods and goddesses to hide themselves 
in animals, assumed the shape of a cat. So Ovid, 
" Fele soror Phoebi latuit." 
[The sister of Phoebus lay hid under the form of a cat.] 

See Brand's Observations on Pojmlar Antiquities^ by Ellis, ii. SO-l', 395.; 
a work which may be usefully consulted, as containing a great fund of 
curious information on the subject of omens and superstitions. 

Vol. VII. ~ No. 43. nn 



546 Some Superstitions appertaining 

these occasions, that " the cat has a gale of wind in her tail." 
There may, in this, be something better than mere supersti- 
tion. The fur of the cat is known to be highly electrical : pos- 
sibly, therefore, the change which takes place in the state of 
the atmosphere, previously to a storm, may have some power- 
ful effect on the animal's body, and elate her spirits to a more 
than usual degree. The playfulness of the cat, therefore, 
may, perhaps, be a natural sign of the coming weather, and 
to be accounted for on just and philosophical principles. 

T/ie Horseshoe Superstition, alluded to by Mr. Farmer 
[V. 212.], as practised by sailors, is not confined to men of 
that profession ; I believe it obtains universally, more or less. 
Hence, we continually see horseshoes nailed over the door, 
threshold, or fireplace, &c., in cottages.* Some years ago, I 
happened to pick up a spare horseshoe on my premises ; 
and, thinking that it might possibly be employed again as a 
useful shoe, I hung it loose over the top bar of a wicket-gate 
leading from the foldyard to the orchard, in order that it 
might be seen, and converted to whatever purpose it would 
serve. In this position (though the gate was constantly used 
by people passing through it) the horseshoe hung undis- 
turbed for several years. I think I am within compass when 
I say four or five at the least: indeed, it is only within these 
few months that I have missed it ; and I dare venture to say, 
that, had any other article, not regarded with any degree of 
superstitious veneration, been so deposited, it would scarcely 
have remained in the same place for as many wrecks. 

Weasel. — In some parts of the country-, it is looked upon 
as an unfavourable omen for a weasel to have crossed one's 
path t ; and ill success, on any particular occasion, is some- 

* See Brand, ii. 379. It is esteemed good luck to find old iron gene- 
rally ; and, in particular, a horseshoe. 

-|- Brand observes, that the meeting of a weasel is a bad omen ; also, on 
the authority of older writers, that " it is very ill luck to have 

A Hare cross one in the Highway.^'' 

" Nor did we meet, with nimble feet. 
One little fearful Lepus; 
That certain sign, as some divine. 
Of fortune bad, to keep us." 

See Brand, ii. 518, &c., where several other curious instances of the 
same kind are recorded ; as, e. g., that " it is accounted good luck if 

A Wolf cross our Wai/.'' The following explanation is thus given from 
A Helpe to Discourse: — "Our ancestors, in times past, as they were 
merry-conceited, so were they witty : and thence it grew that they held it 
good lucke if a wolf crost the way, and was gone without any more danger 
or trouble ; but ill lucke, if a hare crost and escaped them, that they had 
not taken her.'*

times absurdly attributed to this cause. On the other hand, 
I have lately been informed, that, if the first time you see 

A Lamb in the Sprifig, it stand with its head towards you, 
it is considered a lucky circumstance ; and still more so, if it 
happen to be a black one. Black Iambs, indeed, I find, have 
a sort of superstitious preference sometimes shown them ; 
and, on account of their colour alone, are often reserved to 
form part of the flock, instead of being disposed of to the 
butcher. 

The Raven and the Owl have been regarded as birds of 
ominous portent, time out of mind. 

" Is it not ominous, in all countries, 
When crows and ravens croak upon trees ? " 

Hudibras, part ii. canto iii. 707. 

" The raven himself is hoarse. 

That croaks the fatal enterance of Duncan 
Under my battlements." Macbeth, 

" Came he right now to sing a raven's note. 
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers." 

Henri/ F/., part ii. 

" O I it comes o'er my memory, 

As doth the raven o'er the infected house, 

Boding to all." * Othello. 

So harsh and mournful is the ordinary voice of the raven, 
that this alone may, perhaps, be sufficient to account for the 
bird's being looked upon, by ignorant and superstitious minds, 
as presaging ill. It has often occurred to me, when exploring 
the more inaccessible parts of the British mountains (though 
without feeling any superstitious dread on the occasion), that 
the ravens, whose " ancient solitary reign " I had invaded, 
uttered their harsh croak, as they soared over my head, in 
expectation, as it were, of my falling down the ravines and 

* See Brand, ii. 527. ; where several other passages relating to the raven 

are quoted. 

It is essential that we do not confound the raven of the poets with their 
Night Raven; although they attribute enough of nocturnal bodings to 

the former. The night raven (Mr. Dovaston tells us, in VI. 9.) is the 

bittern ; and the nightly " boomps " of this bird agree very well with the 

** Irompe of doleful dreere " of Spenser : — 

" The ill-fac'd owle, death's dreadful messengere. 
The hoarse night raven, trompe of dolefull dreere.'* Spenser. 

Is the night crow another name for the night raven? or is it merely a 
bird of the poets ?

548 Some Superstitions appertaining 

precipices, and of their chance of becoming my "executors,"* 
and having to feed on my hfeless carcass. Pennant tells us 
that " a vulgar respect is paid to the raven, as being the bird 
appointed by heaven to feed the prophet Elijah, when he fled 
from the rage of Ahab." (1 Kings, xvii. See Brand, vol. ii. 
p. 526.) From whatever source the notion may have derived 
its origin, I find that it is considered bad luck to kill a raven. 
I happened once to be in conversation, on this subject, with 
a countryman, who seemed to regard the perpetration of such 
an act in a very serious light. On my questioning him far- 
ther, he told me that a friend of his once shot a raven, an4 
that, " somehow or another (he did not know how it was), 
his best cow died within a week after; and he had made 
up his mind that nothing should ever induce him to shoot 
another." This instance affords an apt illustration of one of 
the fallacies enumerated by Sir Thomas Brown : " collecting 
presages from voice or food of birds, and conjoining events 
unto causes of no connection." (See Vulgar Errors, book i. 
chap. 4.) 

iTke Owl.^ — From a similar cause, perhaps, to that just 
mentioned in the case of the raven, the discordant screech of 
the owl has probably come to be regarded with no little super- 
stitious dread, as foreboding evil ; and the more so, perhaps, 
from the circumstance of its being heard only in the dark or 
twilight. 

" The obscure bird 

Clamour'd the livelong night." Macbeth, 

" Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night. 

The time when scritch-owls cry, and ban-dogs howl. 

That time best fits the work we have in hand." 

Henry F/., part ii. 

" The owl shriek'd at thy birth, an evil sign." 

Henry VI., part iii. 

" The Roman senate, when within 
The city walls an owl was seen. 
Did cause their clergy, with lustrations 
(Our synod calls humiliations).

From doing town or country hurt." -j- 

Hudibrasy part ii. canto iii. 709. 

* " Their executors, the knavish crows. 

Fly o'er them all, impatient for their hour." Henry V.

Mr. Waterton's amusing article on " the habits of th* barn owl" (V. 9., 
&c.), for classical quotations.

So well known and established was the character of the 
owl as a bird of omen, that Shakspeare uses the term meta- 
phorically, applying it to inauspicious persons : — 

" Thou ominous and fearful owl of death, 
Our nation's terror, and their bloody scourge ! " 

Henry VI. y part i. 

Again, in the Third Part of Henry F/., Edward, speaking of 

Clifford, says : — 

" Bring forth that fatal scritch-owl to our house. 
That nothing sung but death to us and ours." 

Speaking once, in defence of these birds, to a very respectable 
man-servant, who disliked them so much as to express a wish 
that they should be destroyed, I said I thought them very 
inoffensive and amusing, if not useful, creatures. " I don't 
know, Sir, for that," he replied ; " but I know I find them 
very bad company, when I get up at four or five o'clock on a 
winter's morning to brew." [See Mr. Bree in continuation, 
in p. 593.] 

\_Rooks are reputed to leave a Rookery at the Death of the 
Owner ofit^ Sfc.'] — A medical friend has lately informed me 
that a notion prevails with some, that the rooks will leave the 
rookery on the death of the owner or other member of the 
family. Being, on one occasion, in professional attendance 
on a lady during her last illness, he tells me, that, shortly 
before her dissolution, when it became apparent that she 
could not survive many hours, it was remarked to him by 
some one in the house : — "I wonder whether the rooks will 
leave the rookery on this occasion : they did so on the decease 

of the late (the former possessor); and likewise on that 

of his brother, who preceded him." The birds in the present 
instance, I am told, were only a trifle out in their calculation : 
they quitted the next morning ; though the patient, contrary 
to all expectation, lingered through the day, and was not 
released (if 1 rightly remember) till the evening of the day 
following. I do not know at what period of the year the 
above-mentioned circumstance took place : and this is an 
important point in the present case, as the rooks (except, 
perhaps, in very large rookeries), do not abide constantly in 
their breeding-places, but merely pay them occasional visits. 

\_Toads found incarcerated.'] — We are for ever seeing 
accounts in the newspapers, and elsewhere, of toads being 
found alive embedded in solid wood or stone, or even in blocks 
of marble [see VI. 458 — 459.] : it is not for me to say that 
such reports are altogether without foundation, or unworthy 
of credit. [See in VII. 519.] In felling a tree, when the 
axe comes in contact (as it frequently does) with a more than

550 Some Superstitmis appertaining 

usually tough and gnarled portion of timber, it will sometimes 
rebound at the stroke, without making any incision. On 
such occasions, the woodmen in this part of the country say 
the axe " buffs ; " and they have, some of them, a sort of 
floating traditionary notion, handed down to them from their 
forefathers, that this rebounding of the axe is attributable to 
a toad which lies enclosed within the root of the tree, and 
which, accordingly, they may expect to find there. I remem- 
ber an old woodman, the father of a man who now works for 
me, who seemed to entertain a more than half belief in this 
notion ; though, upon enquiry, I could not learn that he had 
ever known it verified by fact. The similarity in sound be- 
tween the verb " buff," and " bufo," the Latin for a toad, is 
here remarkable ; and the coincidence might induce some 
etymologists to derive the one word from the other. But it 
strikes me as hardly probable that these simple woodmen 
should be indebted to the learned languages, and should have 
borrowed their provincial term from the Latin ; still less do 
I suppose that they have ever read the line in Virgil, 

" Inventusque cavis bufo." Georg. i. 184. 

" And toads in crannies found." Trapp's Translation. 

Superstition and credulity are by no means confined to the 
vulgar and illiterate; the minds of the better informed are 
often powerfully biased by such influence. I knew a gentle- 
man of liberal education, who maintained that it was 

Easy toforetel "what Sort of Summer it would be by the Posi- 
tion in which the Larva of Cicada (Aphrophora) spumdria 
was found to lie in the Froth [CucJcoo-spit) in which it is e?ive- 
loped. If the insect lay with its head upwards, it infallibly 
denoted a dry summer ; if downwards, a wet one ! * An 
old lady of my acquaintance entertained an opinion that 

The Jelly-like Substance {a Species of Tremella P), which is 
frequently to be found, after rain, upon turf or neglected 
pathways, was the remains of a fallen star ; the snuff, as it 
were, of the extinguished luminary ! f The same lady also 
deemed it hazardous to walk abroad in the shrubbery or the 
garden after dusk, for fear of 

The Bats; which, she maintained, had a villanous pro- 
pensity of striking at people's eyes ! I need hardly observe, 

* Is there any foundation in fact for the following proverbial saying, 
which is common in this neighbourhood, viz, : — 

" A good bark harvest, a good corn harvest ? " 
This year (1832), the two seasons have certainly corresponded pretty 
accurately: the earlier part of each was very favourable; afterwards, in 
both cases, came heavy rains,

" In setting a Hen^^' says Grose, " the good women hold 
it an indispensiible rule to put an odd number of eggs. This 
predilection for odd numbers is very ancient ; and is men- 
tioned by Virgil in his eighth Eclogue : — 

" Numero Deus impare gaudet." f 

" Heav'n uneven numbers loves." Trapp's 7\anslat'ion, 

The Beformation of the Calendar, in the Year 1752, or the 
Change of Style, as it is called (an event which we of the pre- 
sent day are sometimes apt entirely to overlook J), was long 
recollected with much dissatisfaction by many among the 
lower orders. It appeared to them to be a sort of sacrilegious 
interference, a profane attempt to alter the course of nature. 
In perilous times, and in the hands of artful and designing 
men, such an event might have been employed too success- 
fully as a powerful engine for promoting all kinds of political 
discontent. By the help of that most common fallacy, post

after this or that circumstance is therefore said to have hap-

:j: An instance in point came under my observation very lately. Appli- 
cation was made to me for some extracts from the parish register, of about 
the date of 1742, i. e. ten years previously to the change of style. Among 
other entries, of which I was requested to furnish copies, were the mar- 
riage of A. B. and C. D., which took place on April 20. 1742; and the 
baptism of the eldest son of the same parties, which took place on Jan. 27. 
of the same year. Shortly after I had furnished the above extracts, I 
received a second visit from the applicant, with a request that I would 
reexamine the registers; for that there must be some mistake in copying 
the extracts, since, according to them, it would appear that the child was 
illegitimate, as the baptism took place three months before the solemnis- 
ation of the marriage. Had this gentleman borne in mind, that, previously 
to the alteration of the style, the year commenced on the 25th of March, 
and that, accordingly, January came towards the latter end of the year, 
not (as now) at the beginning, he might have saved himself the trouble of 
a second perusal of the parish documents : they, and the extracts made 
from them, were quite correct, and as they should be, and the child no 
bastard; for the marriage was solemnised on the 20th of April, and on the 
27th of January folhnu'mg (i. e. nine months after) the chilil was born, or 
at least baptised. The same blunder, and with reference to the selfsame 
entries, I recollect to have been made by a solicitor in the time of my pre- 
decessor, who received a second application to reexamine the registers 
after he had furnished copies of the entries above mentioned.

552 Some Superstitions appertaining 

pened on account of it, there is scarce any conceivable public 
evil, such as unfruitful seasons, pestilential diseases, bad 
government, disastrous warfare, &c., &c., which might not 
have beep attributed to this innovation as the cause ; and the 
minds of many would have been amply prepared to give 
credence to such absurdities. I knew an old labourer, a 
native of an obscure village in this county (Warwickshire), 
who recollected the alteration of the style ; and who, to the 
last, was never reconciled to it: he stoutly maintained that 
the nation had never prospered since. " I did not wish," 
said he, '< to make mischief; so I never said anything about 
it to my son : but you may depend upon it. Sir, the nation 
has ne'er prospered sin' the style were changed. If you 11 
observe. Sir, the cuckoo and the swallows, and everything 
else, they don't care for the change : they all come and go by 
the old time, not by the new. I don't know," continued he, 
'' what use it were of, unless it were to make the parson tell 
lies on a Sunday." " How so. Master Caister ? " " Why, 
Sir, he says it is the tenth day of the month, when it is n't the 
tenth." He assured me that the inhabitants of his native 
parish were so disgusted with the change, that they were at 
the pains of procuring a minister, at their own private expense, 
to perform divine service upon old Christmas day ; and that 
they made a point of going about their ordinary occupations, 
and setting their servants to work, on the new. Moreover, a 
deputation, consisting of two of these simple villagers, was 
actually sent down to Glastonbury for the purpose of consult- 
ing the holy thorn * upon the occasion : a sprig of which, 
gathered on old Christmas day, in leaf (or else in flower, I 
forget which), was brought back in triumph to the village. 
The old adage, 

" Better, better ne'er be bom, 
Than on the Sabbath pare the horn" (i. e. the nails), f 

was probably invented with the view to discountenance the 
desecration of the Lord's day by the performance of a variety 
of little odd jobs ; which, however improper an occupation 

* Pilgrimages to Glastonbury ^ upon a like errandy were, it seems, by no 
means unusual. " Certain it is that the Glastonbury thorn has preserved 
its inflexibility, and observed its old anniversary. Many thousand specta- 
tors visited it on the Parliamentary Christmas day ; not a bud was to be 
seen ! On the true nativity it was covered with blossoms. One must be 
an infidel indeed to spurn at such authority." " A vast concourse of 
people attended the noted thorn on Christmas eve, new style; but, to their 
great disappointment, there was no appearance of its blowing ; which made 
them watch it narrowly the 5th of January, the Christmas day, old style, 
when it blowed as usual." See Brand, ii. 663.

they may constitute for the Christian Sabbath, do not strictly 
come within the literal meaning of the word " work." In 
like manner, the practice, among schoolboys, of always 

Giving away One of Two Kernels^ which are occasionally 
found within the Shell of the same Nut, because it is unlucky 
to eat both, may have originated from a desire to inculcate 
the moral lesson of liberaUty, and the duty of imparting to 
others a portion of what one possesses. But I know not how 
to account for the belief in the efficacy of 

Swallowing the Germ of a Walnut, and, at the same Moment, 
wishing for some desired Object, in order to its attainment. 
Hence the germ, or vital apex, of the walnut is sometimes 
called " the wish ; " and, unless it be swallowed entire, the 
charm is broken, and the thing wished for will not be 
accomplished. 

A Peascod, with Nine Peas in it, is supposed to be of potent 
efficacy in discovering a damsel's matrimonial lot in life. The 
peascod is to be placed over the door; and the man who first 
takes it dow^n, if single, is to become the husband of the fair 
depositor. This practice, though somewhat varied in par- 
ticulars, is mentioned by Gay in the following lines * ; — 

" As peascods once I pluck'd, I chanced to see 
One that was closely fill'd with three times three ; 
Which, when I cropp'd, I safely home convey'd. 
And o'er the door the spell in secret laid : 
The latch moved up, when who should first come in, 
But, in his proper person, — Lubberkin ! " 

The country youths, of both sexes, adopt the following 
method of ascertaining whether the objects of their affections 
entertain for them a mutual regard : — 

The Flower qfCentaurea nigra, or Knapxveed f (here called 
hard-head), is gathered, and the entire upper portion is 
shaved off with a knife or scissors, exactly on a level with the 
top of the calyx ; the calyx, together with the remainder of 
its contents, is then put in the })ocket: if, by the following 
day, the stumps of the florets (as I may call them) shall have 
shot out, so as to protrude beyond the extremity of the calyx 
(as they are almost certain to do from the warmth of the 
pocket), it is regarded as a favourable omen, a sure sign that 
love is reciprocal. This is one of those instances in which 
the mind readily lends itself to a manifest self-deception, and 
is willing to believe in the truth of what it hopes for. It 
were to be wished that the same kind of delusion never ope-

5 si; Some Superstitions appeiiaining 

rated in cases of greater importance. In Cornwall, I have 
heard a proverbial sa^'ing, of a nearly opposite tendency to 
the superstition just mentioned : — '* If rain fall upon the 
clothes which women hang out to dry after a wash, it is a sign 
that their sweethearts do not love them." Let me not be 
suspected of treason or disloyalty for narrating another absurd 
notion : — 

'* If there are no Keys (/. e. Seed-vessels) upon the Ash Trees, 
it is a Sign that, within a Twelvemonth, there will he no King" 
— William the Fourth and his royal successors need be under 
no alarm on this account. The proverb supposes two events 
which never take place : for as, according to the genius of 
our constitution, the king never dies ; so, no season, I believe, 
ever occurs in which the ash trees are wholly destitute of keys. 
The vulgar saying, that 

" When Gorse (\J^lex europce^a) is out of Blossom, Kissing is 
out of Season," I should suppose, is only a proverbial mode of 
expressing the length of time which gorse continues in bloom. 

\_Plants of the Fennel, if we would have them grow in a Gai^^ 
den, must he stolen.^ — Some of our horticultural friends may, 
perhaps, be surprised to be told, that, " if they want fennel to 
grow in their gardens, they must steal it; for, if it be either 
given or bought, it will not grow." Of a like character is the 
old distich relating to marum {Teiicrium Mkrum), for which 
cats are known to have so strong a partiality [they have, too, 
for Valeriana officinalis, and for A^epeta Cataria ; to which 
last I have known the lines applied, perhaps by mistake] : — 

" If you set it, the cats will eat it ; 
But if you sow it, the cats wo'n't know it." 

Formerly, it used to he considered that the Efficaaj of many 
Hecipes was the more powerful and. certain, where something of 
Mystery was employed in the Manner of preparing them. — An 
old man in this village (a former parish clerk) possessed a 
really valuable (I believe, infallible) recipe for the cure of that 
loathsome disease the itch ; one ingredient of which was the 
root of the common dock. I well remember to have heard, 
as a boy, that, the better to effect a cure, it was thought (if 
not indispensable, at least desirable) that the dock roots 
should be gathered in the night; or, at all events, that the 
person gathering them should not be observed while so 
employed. The reader will at once call to mind one of the 
ingredients of the witches' caldron : — 

" Root of hemlock, digg'd i' the dark." Macbeth. 

The present possessor of the receipt, however, I find, on 
enquiry, knows nothing of any necessity or virtue attached to 



to certain Natural Objects, 555 

the nocturnal culling of the simples: and it is not improbable 
that the secrecy, formerly supposed to be requisite, was, in this 
instance, adopted in order to obviate the chance of any one 
discovering the ingredients of a nostrum from which the pro- 
prietor derived considerable profit. 

[^Superstitions connected with Plants: with the Cyclamen.'] — 
Of the supposed virtues which, in the olden time, were super- 
stitiously attributed to plants, it would be tedious to enter 
into a minute description.* They who are curious on such 
subjects, may be referred to the quaint pages of our old 
herbalists. (See Gerarde and Parkinson, passim.) As a spe- 
cimen, however, I extract the following salutary caution, 
relative to the virtues, or rather dangers, of the cyclamen, 
from Gerarde's Herbal; just remarking, by the way, that the 
extreme absurdity of attributing such extraordinary proper- 
ties to plants may possibly, and very naturally, have brought 
their real properties somewhat into disrepute : and, accord- 
ingly, while our forefathers undoubtedly attributed far too 
much efficacy to various articles of the vegetable kingdom, it 
may admit of a question, whether we of the present day do 
not incline rather to the opposite extreme, and attribute to 
them too little. " It is not good," says this grave disciple of 
iEsculapius, " for women with childe to touch or take this 
herbe (cyclamen), or to come neere unto it, or stride over 
the same where it groweth ; for the naturall attractive vertue 
therein contained is such, that, without controversie, they 
that attempt it in manner above said, shall be delivered before 
their time : which danger and inconvenience to avoid, I have 
(about the place where it groweth in my garden) fastened 
stickes in the ground, and some other stickes I have fastened 
also cross-waies over them, lest any woman should, by lament- 
able experiment, finde my words to bee true, by their stepping 
over the same." fin Johnson's Gerarde is appended the fol- 

* The following passage occurs in Sir Thomas Brown's works : — " We 
omit to recite the many virtues and endless faculties ascribed unto plants, 
which sometime occur in grave and serious authors ; and we shall make a 
bad transaction for truth to concede a verity in half. To reckon up all, it 
were imployment for Archimedes, who undertook to write the number of 
the sands. Swarms of others there are, some whereof our future endea- 
vours may discover; common reason, 1 hope, will save us a labour in many ; 
whose absurdities stand naked unto every eye; errors not able to deceive 
the embleme of justice, and need no Argus to descry them. Herein there 
surely wants expurgatory animadversions, whereby we might strike out 
great numbers of hidden qualities ; and, having once a serious and con- 
ceded list, we might, with more encouragement and safety, attempt their 
reasons." {Vulgar Errors, book ii. ch. 7.) 

f The same [)ro[)erty has been ascribed to "brake, or female fern" 
(Pteris aquilina?). See Brown's Vulgar EnorSy b i. chap. 8, 



556 Some Superstitions appertaining 

lowing editorial note : — "I judge our author something too 
womanish in this ; that is, led more by vain opinion than by 
any reason or experience, to confirme this his assertion ; 
which frequent experience shews to be vaine and frivolous, 
especially for the touching, striding over, or comming neere 
to this herbe." (Johnson's Gerarde, p. 846.) 

Charms or Superstitious Ceremonies for the Cure of the Ague 
were much employed of old ; and " abacadabra," or 
similar gibberish, written in fantastic shapes, and with much 
formality, constituted, with our ancestors, most potent reme- 
dies.* Another infallible remedy was as follows : — A lock 
of hair was to be cut from the nape of the patient's neck, 
which he was himself to take to a particular aspen tree, 
pointed out for the purpose. An incision was then made in 
the bark, under which the severed lock of hair was to be left 
deposited, and the bark closed up, and restored to its natural 
position. All this (as I have said) was to be performed by 
the patient himself; and it is not for me to say that the 
exertion occasioned by the performance of this ceremony 
might not induce perspiration, e. g., or other salutary effects, 
having a natural tendency to mitigate the disorder ; or, what 
is, perhaps, still more probable, the disorder abated of itself, 
and not so much in consequence of the treatment as in spite of 
it. The aspen tree (Populus tremula) was, of course, selected 
on these occasions on account of the trembling propensity of 
its leaves, between which and the quaking and shivering of 
the patient it was obvious to trace a fanciful analogy. 

To cure the Hooping- Cough^ we are recommended to meet 
with a man on a skewbald horse, and to enquire of him what 
is good for the complaint f; the remed}^, whatever it may be, 
which he recommends, will prove infallible. Within my 
recollection, a near relative of my own, out of pure curiosity, 
put the question to an honest countryman mounted on a 
horse of the above description : the answer was returned off 
hand, and without hesitation : — " Give them sugared bread 
and butter, Sir." The readiness of the man's reply was 
proof sufficient that the question had been often put to him, 
as, indeed, he acknowledged it had been, and that he had 
always given the same inoffensive answer. For the same 
complaint in a child, it is recommended that the little suf-

April 11. 1681, is preserved the following curious incident: — * I took, 
early in the morning, a good dose of eUxir, and hung three spiders about 
my neck, and they drove my ague away.' " — Ibid.y p. 590.

ferer be drawn, nine mornings, fasting, through the arch 
formed by a briar that is rooted into the soil at both ends ; 
i. e., the young shoot of a bramble (72ilbus), which, when it 
comes in contact with the ground, usually takes root again 
at the end, like the runner of a strawberry. 

[y4 7'ece?it histance of constituting a Rupture- Ash.'] — One 
other instance of credulity and superstition I must mention, 
which fell under my own observation within these few years. 
In a plantation which I had made and nursed with some in- 
terest, I observed a thriving young ash plant carefully lapped 
round with a taching end, i. e., a shoemaker's waxed string. 
On closer examination I perceived that the tree had been 
cut through in a horizontal direction to the centre, and then 
split upwards perpendicularly to the length of about 2 ft. I 
was not a little puzzled even to conjecture for what purpose 
the tree had been subjected to such severe treatment. The 
injury sustained, it was plain, could not have been done acci- 
dentally ; and, had it been done for mere mischief's sake, the 
perpetrator, I thought, would hardly have been at the pains 
carefully to lap the injured stem round with a taching end. 
After some enquiry, the whole history came to light : a neigh- 
bouring shoemaker had a child badly ruptured; and, in order 
to effect a cure, the tree had been split, and the infant passed 
between the two halves thus separated for the purpose ; these 
were then bound together, as already described ; and if the 
parts finally united (so the belief goes), the child would 
recover ! * With the knowledge of so ready and effectual a 
remedy, who need ever again apply to Sir Astley Cooper, or 
any of his fraternity, in a case of strangulated hernia? 

Such are among the superstitious usages and opinions which 
obtained in former times, and which, it seems, even yet, in 
these enlightened days, have not quite lost their influence over 
the minds of men. While we smile, however, as well we 
may, at the ignorance and credulity of past ages, and plume 
ourselves, perhaps, with no little self-complacency, on our 
own superior knowledge, it becomes us not to sit down lazily 
satisfied with present acquirements, as if we ourselves had 
already attained the very pinnacle of wisdom. The advance 
of knowledge should only stimulate us to farther exertions. 

* According to Brand, " this is a very ancient and extensive piece of 
superstition." See Brand, ii. 591., where an account is given from the 
Gentleman's Magazine ^ for October, 1804, of the ceremony liaving been 
practised in the parish of Solihull, in Warwickshire. See also Gilbert 
White's account of this superstition, and of tlie " shrew-ash." (Letter 28. 
to Daines Barrington.) 



558 Nature an exJiaustless Source of Intelligence, 

If it be the first step to distinguish the false from the true *, 
there still remains, when this is done, a wide and immeasur- 
able field open before us for diligent research and investiga- 
tion. The mine we work in is inexhaustible ; and immense 
stores of rich and unwrought ore yet await and solicit the 
labours of our hands. " Multum adhuc restat operis, mul-

occasio aliquid adhuc adjiciendi." Much work remains to be 
done, and will remain ; nor will any one, born after the lapse 
of a thousand ages, be precluded from the opportunity of 
adding something to the general stock.

[ The Anatomical Treatise of M. Lyonnet on the Caterpillar 
of the Cosstis ligniperda has, from the period of the publication 
of it, 70 years ago, been considered as a production quite 
unrivalled for minute and accurate research. (From a mention 
of the works of Lyonnet in I. 282.) 

The late Rev. Lansdown Guilding had connected the fol- 
lowing forcible remark with that mention, in a collection of 
notes which he had made in relation to subjects contained in 
Vols. I. and II. of this Magazine, and had sent to us before 
his death (see p. 355.). (There is but one date to the whole 
collection ; it is at the end, and is, " St. Vincent, May 1. 
1830.")] 

How many thousands of animals are there equally worthy 
of an anatomical treatise as the Cossus described by Lyonnet : 
but were all the inhabitants of our globe employed in the 
task, when would they furnish illustrations of the countless 
works of nature, in their various stages of growth and per- 
fection ? In a higher and nobler sphere of existence, all that 
is now hidden, or beyond the industry of man, may be made 
known to us.

Art. II. A short Sketch of the most remarkable of the Vulgar 
Prejudices cojinected with Objects of Natural History. By 
W. G. Barker, Esq. 

It is surprising that, in all ages, some birds and quadrupeds 
have most undeservedly fallen into an almost general dislike, 
while others have been elevated, with as little reason, high 
in the regard of the vulgar. 

The Nightjar [Caprimidgus europaeus) has been peculiarly 
unfortunate in the former of these respects : its common names, 
" goatsucker," and " puckeridge," have been given to it in 
consequence of its supposed evil habits. It is accused, in 
Italy, of sucking the teats of goats : hence the origin of the 
appellation Caprimulgus [goat-milker] ; and this term has, in 
consequence of the imagined crimes of an individual species, 
been foolishly applied to the whole genus. It is unaccount- 
able how such a charge could arise. The other accusation 
against the nightjar is, that of its inflicting upon weanling 
calves the disorder known by the name of puckeridge ; and 
this it is supposed to do by striking at them. The absurdity 
of this makes any refutation of it unnecessary. 

The Hedgehog (EArindceus europc&us) has been charged with 
sucking the teats of cows and sheep ; a charge as unfounded, 
and as unjust, as that against the nightjar. The sages by 
whom the alleged guilt of the hedgehog, in this particular, 
was discovered, had forgotten to examine the mouth of this 
animal : had they only taken the trouble to do this, they would 
have found that it is utterly impossible for so small an animal 
to take the teat of a cow, or even that of a sheep, between its 
jaws ; and, without this means of contact, they would not, 
surely, assert that the deed could be possibly committed. 
The hedgehog is, too, accused of ascending trees for the pur- 
pose of carrying oif fruit on the points of its spines. Persons 
who have kept these animals in gardens deny the charge, and 
say that they have never seen them attempt to climb into fruit 
trees, or to even carry off fallen fruit upon their spines. In- 
deed, if the hedgehog ever did the latter, it is to me a mystery 
how it would act to disengage the fruit again. Count de 
Buflbn kept a litter of young ones, with their mother, for some 
time, and these refused to touch cherries and fruit when offered 
to them. In the summer of 1830, a great many carnations 
withered away and died. A gardener, the greater portion of 
whose stock had perished in this manner, observing that a 
number of hedgehogs frequented his grountls, immediately 
fixed upon them as the depredators, and, communicating the 
idea to others, who, like himself, had been sufferers, a general 



560 Some remarkable Vulgar Prejudices 

persecution against these animals was commenced. I was not 
very well pleased with this, and endeavoured to persuade a 
person, who was thoroughly convinced of the guilt of the 
hedgehog, that these creatures did him, in reality, more ser- 
vice than injury; and that the true motive of their visiting the 
garden grounds was to feed on the slugs, which abounded 
that year, and did great injury to the vegetables, flowers, &c. 
Argument was, however, useless. He assured me that hedge- 
hogs had actually been caught in the carnation beds ; and this, 
though far from satisfactory to me, was in his mind at once a 
proof of their guilt. Finding it hopeless to convince him of 
his error, I gave up the attempt as useless. [Had the con- 
tents of the stomachs of a few of the killed hedgehogs been 
shown to him, he might, it is not very improbable, have been 
convinced. See on the hedgehog, farther, in No. 44.] 

The hedgehog and nightjar are disliked on account of their 
supposed evil habits ; but the antipathy entertained in America 
by some towards a bird which inhabits there, of the same 
genus. 

The Whip-poor- Will (Capri?milgus vociferus), seems to have 
originated in superstition. This bird is never seen during 
the daytime. Its chosen haunts, like those of the nightjar of 
Europe, are in the most retired, solitary, and deep-shaded 
parts of the woods, and here it reposes in silence till the dusk 
of evening calls it out to the more cultivated parts of the 
country, in search of its food, which consists of moths, grass- 
hoppers, and ants [and coleopterous insects : see in No. 44.]. 
Such being its habits, no wonder that it should be regarded 
by the ignorant and unlearned as the dread concomitant of 
supernatural beings. Wilson thus describes its visits: — " At 
first it issues from some retired })art of the woods, the glen, 
or the mountain ; in a few evenings, perhaps, we hear them 
from the adjoining coppice, the garden fence, the road before 
the door, and even from the roof of the dwelling-house, long 
after the family have retired to rest. Some of the more igno- 
rant or superstitious consider this near approach as foreboding 
no good to the family ; nothing less than sickness, misfortune, 
or death, to some of its members : these visits, however, so 
often occur without any bad consequences, that this super- 
stitious dread seems on the decline." It is to be hoped, indeed, 
that, as science advances, these foolish notions will be entirely 
eradicated. [For Mr. Waterton's account of the goatsuckers 
in Demerara, and the superstitions there connected with them, 
see his Waiiderings ; or see this account quoted by Dr. Drum- 
mond, in his delightful Letters to a Yoting Naturalist, p. 129.

which inhabits near Lime, see in our Number for Decem- 
ber.] 

The same Dread has been entertained to\soards the Oxicl, and 
has been extended to all nocturnal Birds. — They appear only 
at dark and twilight, when the feathered choir, which during 
the day made the woods and vales reecho to their cheerful 
notes, are slumbering in the recesses of the grove; when 

" The seafowl is gone to her nest, 

And the beast is laid down in his lair ;" 

the flowers, whose rising incense had perfumed the air, have 
closed their petals and are at rest ; the irolicksome lamb sleeps 
by its parent : and nature is hushed to universal repose ; nio-ht 
moths flit shadowy through the silent air ; and the bat on 
leathern wing glides by : this is the calm, the silent, hour, 
when imagination sees the forms of bygone years pass dreadful 
before her view ; superstition adds terror to the darkness, and 
beholds, horror-struck, the spirits of the departed glide by : 
then it is that the nocturnal bird, which wanders lonely for its 
food, is linked as the partner of those tremendous beings. 
The owl flitting by the ivy-mantled tower of the village church, 
and haunting the cemetery in the hours of darkness, is regarded 
with suspicion and awe ; and hence it is detested as the omen 
of sorrow, and is feared as the forerunner of the death of 
men. If Mr. Waterton's example (V. 12.) were followed, 
the dread of the owl, which is still entertained in remote places, 
would be entirely removed. His sketch of the habits of this 
bird, his plea in defence of it, and his evidence of the benefits 
man receives from it, in V. 9 — 15., have done so much to 
explode the vulgar notion, that all addition here would be 
useless. 

\_The Yellowhammer [Emberiza Citrinella),'] — There is a 
bird universally disliked by the British countryfolk, and, as 
far as I can discover, without any reason ; I mean, the yellow- 
hammer. Many persons who would not m.olest or injure the 
nest and young of other birds, will invariably take, and even 
ill-use, those of the yellowhammer. This prejudice appears 
to be utterly unfounded. It is one of the prettiest of the 
English birds, and at the same time one of the tamest. In 
its aj)pearance there is nothing to excite disgust, nor in its 
conduct any thing that deserves punishment: its familiarity 
with man seems the only cause of the unjust persecution of it ; 
for it will be found that in all ages the birds which have excited 
man's admiration are those which, by their lofty port and 
their high and uncontrolled spirit, have prevented his too near 
Vol. VII.— No. 43. o o 



562 Some remarlcable Vulgar Prejudices 

approach, and scorned the benefits of civilisation. The little 
yellowhammer, on the contrary, flies not from our presence ; 
it rather seeks it; it is the companion of our walks, and flits 
from branch to branch beside us ; it is generally to be seen in 
the hedges by the roadside, and I think is not often to be 
met with in retired fields, at least, I have never observed it in 
such situations. With these habits, it might be reasonably 
expected to be a favourite bird with the generality of people ; 
but, unfortunately, it is quite the contrary, and I cannot dis- 
cover any reason for so foolish a prejudice. [Mr. Barker 
has, since writing the preceding, sent us the following: — Ac- 
cording to Mudie's British Nafiiralisf, the reason why the 
peasantry dislike the Emberiza Citrinella is on account of three 
drops of the devil's blood which they suppose it receives on 
the morning of May-day. I can only say that I have never 
met with any traces of this folly in Yorkshire. — March 22. 
1833.] 

The Catbird of America {Turdus lividns) may be adduced 
as another instance of the folly of prejudice. This species is 
very common and numerous in Pennsylvania. " In spring 
or summer," says Wilson, the self-taught and elegant historian 
of the birds of America, " the first salutation you receive, on 
approaching thickets of bramble, is from the catbird ; and a 
stranger, unacquainted with its note, would instantly conclude 
that some vagrant orphan kitten had got bewildered amongst 
the briers, and wanted assistance ; so exactly does the call of 
the bird resemble the note of that animal. W^ith every amiable 
quality to recommend him, few people in the country respect 
the catbird ; on the contrary, it is generally the object of dis- 
like; and the boys of the United States entertain the same 
prejudice and contempt for this bird, its nest and young, as 
those of Britain do for the yellowhammer, and its nest, eggs, 
and young. I am at a loss to account for this cruel prejudice. 
Even those by whom it is entertained can scarcely tell you 
why, only they ' hate catbirds,' as some persons tell you 
they hate Frenchmen, &c. ; expressions that bespeak their 
own narrowness of understanding and want of liberality. Yet, 
after ruminating over in my own mind all the probable causes, 
I think I have at last hit on some of them ; the principal of 
which seems to me to be a certain similarity of taste, and 
clashing of interest, between the catbird and the farmer. The 
catbird is fond of large ripe garden strawberries ; so is the 
farmer, for the good price they bring in the market. The 
catbird loves the best and richest early cherries ; so does the 
farmer, for they are sometimes the most profitable of his 



connected with Objects of Natural Histor-y. 563 

early fruit. The catbird has a particular partiality for the 
finest mellow pears, which are also particular favourites with 
the farmer; but the catbird has frequently the advantage of 
the farmer by snatching off the first-fVuits of these delicious 
productions, and the farmer takes revenge by shooting him 
down with his gun, as he finds old hats, windmills, and scare- 
crows are no impediment in his way to these forbidden fruits ; 
and nothing but this resource, the ultimatum of farmers as 
well as kings, can restrain his visits. The boys are now set 
to watch the cherry trees with the gun, and thus commence a 
train of prejudices and antipathies that commonly continue 
through life. Perhaps, too, the common note of the catbird, 
so like the mewing of the animal whose name it bears, and 
who itself sustains no small share of prejudice ; the homeliness 
of its plumage ; and even its familiarity, so proverbially known 
to breed contempt, may also contribute to this mean, illiberal, 
and persecuting prejudice: but with the generous and the 
good, the lovers of nature and of rural charms, the confi- 
dence which this familiar bird places in man, by building in 
his garden under his eye, the music of his song, and the 
interesting playfulness of his manners, will always be more 
than a recompense for any little stolen morsels he snatches." 
(Wilson's Amei: Ornith., Professor Jameson's edit., ii. 100.) 
[The amiable feeling expressed in the latter of these remarks 
of Wilson's is quite kindred to that breathed throughout that 
delightful poem, " An Invitation to the Feathered Race, by 
the Rev. Mr. Graves : " of this poem the last stanza is, 

" Let then this league betwixt us made 
Our mutual interests guard, 
Mine be the gift of fruit and shade ; 
Your songs be my reward."] 

The Storm Petrel is one of those luckless birds which, having 
been once associated with superstitious ideas, can never after- 
wards regain the good name they have undeservedly lost. 
Storm petrels are generally seen either during the continu- 
ance of, or immediately previously to, a storm. Their low and 
wailing cry of wcet, weet, mingled with the dashing of the 
wild and foaming surges, and the roar of the rushing blast, 
inspires the minds of the hardiest seamen with a momentary 
awe. Termed emphatically the bird of storm, it faces the 
northern tempest when raging widi its utmost fury, and seats 
itself on the agitated crest of the mountain wave as calmly as 
if resting on the surface of an untroubled lake. This harm- 
less bird is universally regarded by sailors with distrust and 

o o 2 



564) Some remarkable Vulgar Prejudices 

dread : far from considering it as a friendly monitor, whose 
approach forewarns them of the coming storm, they absurdly 
imagine that it possesses the power of raising the tempest, 
and delights in overwhelming in the depths of ocean the help- 
less wanderers of the deep. " As well might they curse the 
midnight lighthouse, that starlike guides them on their watery 
way, or the buoy that warns them of the sunken rocks below." 
[Wilsoji.) 

The curing of RujHiire in Children was formerly attempted 
by passing the affected children, naked, through the two split 
portions, held open by a wedge, of young living ash trees. 
For the details, see White's Natural History of Selborne^ letter 
to Daines Barrington, dated Jan. 8. 1776. [See also Mr. 
Bree, in the preceding communication, in p. 557., where he 
relates a recent instance of the practical observance of this 
superstition.] 

The Field Shrew {S&rex ixrdneus) was formerly accused of 
injuring horses, either by biting or running over them ; and 
whenever a horse in the field was seized with numbness in the 
limbs, he was immediately judged by the old farriers to be 
either planet-struck or shrew-rufi. The mode of cure they 
prescribed, and considered as in all cases infallible, was to 
drag the animal through an arch of a bramble, formed by a 
shoot which had rooted into the ground at the extremity : a 
method, I am told, formerly practised, and even now occasion- 
ally made use of, for the purpose of curing children of the 
hooping-cough. [See Mr. Bree in p. 656.'] Another mode 
of curing shrew-run animals was applying gently to the part 
of them affected the twigs or branches of a shrew- ash. Re- 
specting this superstition, and the mode of constituting a shrew- 
ash, see White's Natural History of Selborne, in the letter 
before cited. The shrew-ash at Selborne seems to have been 
cut down about the year 1758; so that we may refer the 
superstition relative to it to the time when bezoar stone [see 
IV. 285.], theriace, unicorn's horn, and bone of a stag's 
heart pounded small, were held in high repute for curing 
disorders. 

The more we look into the present subject, the more objects 
we find against which superstition and folly have directed 
their deadly shafts ; and were I to bring forward all those 
animals which, from the earliest records, have been so unfor- 
tunate as to fall into this class, I must trespass still farther 
upon the space of the Magazine, and the reader's time. I 
would incidentally add, in relation to Mr. Farmer's notice of 

Superstitions connected mth the Magpie^ in V. 210., that I 
have never heard this bird styled either piannet or pianne ; 



co7inected mth Objects of Natural History. 565 

in Yorkshire it is generally called nanpie, which name is 
also applied to the paeony.

[The word " piannet" is given, in Bailey's Dictionary, as 
a name of " the lesser woodpecker."] 



Additional Superstitions. Love -fortune ascertained by 
Means of the Leaves of the common Ash Tree {Yraxinus excels 
sior W.). — Mr. Bree has informed us, in p. 553., that the 
lads and lasses of Warwickshire ascertain their love-fortune 
by the growth of the shorn florets of Centaurea nigra. In 
Cambridgeshire, I remember that the same end was attained 
playfully, and seemingly by much younger parties, by the help 
of the leaves of the common ash. Such leaves were sought, and 
sought till found, as consisted of as many leaflets as the boy 
was years of age ; and the first lassie met, or perhaps seen, 
after the leaf had been acquired, was to be the future partner. 
The leaflets of the leaf of the ash vary in number, from five 
to eleven, and, upon quite young vigorous-growing ash trees 
(ashlings) to even thirteen ; and very rarely the number is 
an even one, from one of the last pair of leaflets and the ter- 
minal leaflet having been produced grown together. The 
search for the required leaves was at least amusing, and not 
uninstructive. The children of Suffolk have, I have been 
told, several playful phrases which they, in their sports, recite 
in application to 

The alternate Spikelets of the Perennial Darnel (Lolinm 
"perenne L.) : the issue of the recitation depends on the word 
which happens to correspond, in the order of succession, with 
the terminal spikelet of the spike. 

A home-made Kind of Salve was, as lately as within the 
first fifteen years of the present century, in use with some of 
the good grandmothers in Cambridgeshire for curing burns 
or scalds, it is not unlikely for curing both. One of the in- 
gredients in this salve was 

" Grave-stone Moss," that is, moss off grave-stones ; and I 
believe that, in collecting it, less heed was paid to the species 
of the moss, or even to whether it were a moss or a lichen, 
than to the condition that it was taken off' a grave-stone or 
grave-stones. I remember one young woman who wore un- 
seemly scars after, although I cannot say assuredly in con- 
sequence of the use of this salve. 

Witch-Stones were once in use. These were stones naturally 
traversed by a hole through which a string could be passed; 
such as one now at times sees appended to a bunch of keys. 

3 



566 Some rema7'lcahle Vulgar Prejudices, 

A string was passed through the hole of such a stone, which 
was tied by the string to some part of the bedstead, and 
deemed adequate to preserve the occupant of the bed from 
visits from any witch. 

A " Lucixy Stone^' with the boys of Cambridgeshire, is the 
lower or curved half or valve of a fossil species of Gryphae^a, 
a genus of fossil bivalve shells: see II. 31, 32. Instances of 
the occurence of this valve in the gravel used for the roads 
and other purposes are not very rare ; and when a boy meets 
with one, the practice is this : to spit into it and throw it be- 
hind him, over his shoulder, without looking what becomes 
of it : and this to the end of promoting good-fortune to him- 
self. I think that this ceremony is done, however, by the 
boys, more " according to custom " than in deference to any 
serious belief in good results from it. " The devil's toe-nail " 
is a name for this valve of the GryphaeX either in Cambridge- 
shire or Suffolk  % probably in both, and this name itself 
implies a superstition. 

A Species of Belemnifes, a genus of multilocular univalve 
fossil shells (see II. 35.), occurs not very rarely among the 
gravel in Cambridgeshire ; the individuals of which species 
the boys call " thunderbolts;" and have in this case, I believe, 
some real credence of their having been derived to the earth 
from thunderstorms. For Notices ()f Superstitious of a higher 
order connected with Recent, not Fossil, Shells, see III. 256 — 26 1 . 

77ie Nest oj the Robin sacred even to Boys. — Of the boyish 
superstitions which I remember, that with the best tendency 
(all superstitions are bad in themselves, as they afflict the 
mind with an enslaving fear) was one enjoining the leaving 
unrobbed the nest of the robin : whatever boy robbed a robin's 
nest would be punished by having an arm or a leg taken off" 
him ; and this, one " Tom Moody," or somebody who came 
occasionally with powers irresistible, would effect. 

A Superstition connected with the Ass. — The neck, withers, 
and ridge of the back of the ass are traversed by a black 
line of sufficient breadth to make it very obvious, and this 
line is crossed by a similar line which is extended some dis- 
tance down each shoulder ; so that from the two lines the 
figure of a crucifix is fairly presented : this, I was told in 
boyhood, has been the case with the ass, in all individuals of 
the species must be meant, ever since Christ rode upon one, 
on his entry into Jerusalem. {Matthew, xxi.) 

* A cartload (perhaps several cartloads) of fossil shells of a species 
of Gryphae^a, were found, in about 1825, in a pit at Chedberg, Suffolk : we 
wish some Suffolk correspondent would enable us to register authentic 
particulars respecting them. 



Origin of the Song of Birds, 567 

The Milly Thistle. — The fable which accounts for the 
origin of the milky way has been oft admired for its beauty ; 
and those of rural observers, 

" Whose souls proud science never taught to stray 
Far as the solar walk, or milky way," 

associate a similar idea, and one of equal interest to them, 
with the milky thistle, or Virgin Mary's thistle ( Card u us 
Maria;zz/5 L., «Silybum Maria^/z/w Gaertner) : its leaves exhibit 
a beautiful tracery of milk-coloured marking, and the plant 
is reputed to have derived this condition of its leaves from an 
accident assumed to have occurred to the person of the second 
fable, like to that which has been assumed to have happened 
to the ideal person of the first. 

The Leaves of Polygonum Persicdria, a plant common in 
most damp ground in which the soil is stirred occasionally, are 
usually marked towards the centre with a dark-coloured spot, 
and those of the P. /apathif(Mium sometimes are ; and I have 
been told that, in Scotland, a traditionary legend prevails 
regarding one of these species, most probably it is the P. 
Persicaria, which ascribes the origin of the spot-mark in its 
leaves to the accident of a drop of blood having fallen, at the 
crucifixion, upon a plant of this species which was then grow- 
ing near to the foot of the cross. 

Of Superstitions relative to the Application of the Human 
Spittle, tliere are many, as is shown in the Yo7^k Courant news- 
paper of Sept. 11. 1834, in an extract from " Dalyell on the 
Superstitions of Scotland." Reference is made to those re- 
corded by Pliny and other ancient writers, and it is added, 
that, " with equal confidence, the moderns spit into their 
hands when they fight, and spit under the humiliation of dis- 
comfiture ; they spit on money received in traffic, on throwing 
aside the combings of their hair, on wounds in the flesh, and 
on the bite of venomous snakes to cure it ; they spit as a token 
of the most sovereign contempt; and, in one of the remotest 
Scottish islets, spitting into the grave forms part of the funeral 
ceremony." — J. D.

The Sang of Birds is i?ifiate. — I am surprised to find 
(III. 447.) that Mr. Sweet is of opinion [as are Bingley and 
other naturalists] that the song of birds is acquired, and not 
innate : if he were a phrenologist, as well as an ornithologist^ 

o 4 



568 Origin of the Song of Birds. 

he would know that birds have an innate organ of tune, 
which will, of course, lie dormant when the bird is not 
excited to exercise it, as in the case of the nightingale men- 
tioned by Mr. Sweet, and as shown in the experiments of 
Daines Barrington (Pennant's British Zoology, vol. ii. Ap- 
pendix) on the sparrow and linnet, which were put into 
rooms where they neither saw nor heard ajiy other bird : no 
wonder if they did not sing ! A man who had been shut up 
in a room by liimself from his infancy, as in the case of Caspar 
Hauser [see The Penny Magazine, Nos. 118, 119, and 120.: 
the case of " Peter the Wild Boy, caught in the Woods near 
Aveyron," as detailed in a work of this title, may be added], 
would, of course, not be able to speak a word, having no 
occasion for language : but place several persons together in 
a similar situation, and there is no doubt that they would 
make out a language of some kind or other, as they would 
have the desire of communicating, and possess the necessary 
organs for accomplishing it, within themselves. It is the 
same with birds; the parents do not sing: while the young 
remain with them, nor are they taught by their parents. They 
are first invited to sing by the genial warmth of spring, as 
well as for the purpose of attracting a mate ; and emulation 
and an innate organ of imitation doubtless assist in giving 
the bird a desire to sing. The first of these makes them 
cheerful ; the last two give them the desire of doing as the 
other choristers of the woods do ; and an innate organ of tune 
dictates their song. In the experiments before alluded to, 
none of these could be felt. If birds only learn to chirp and 
sing by hearing their parents chirp and sing, how does it 
happen that the duckling and chicken are able to chirp, which 
they begin to do even before the shell is cracked. Surely it 
will not be maintained that their mother taught them I As 
Mr. Thugarton very justly remarks (III. 145.), " if birds 
were not ' true to their sonoj ' we mi"^ht hear strange ano- 
nialies. The chattering starling might entrance us with Phi- 
lomela's strains, or the hoary-headed daw might, in midwinter, 
surprise us with ' the welcome voice of the harbinger of 
spring.' " But it is now time to finish these observations, 
which may, perhaps, be tiresome to your correspondents, as 
what I have endeavoured to prove may have been long familiar 
to most of them : but, in this as in many other cases, phreno- 
logy clears up every thing; whereas, without its aid, the dis-

Art. IV. Facts on Humminor-Birdst their Food, the Manner in 
xvhich theij take it, and on their Habits ; tvith Directions for pre- 
serving the Eggs of Humming- Birds i and the Forms of the 
Bodies of Spiders, and Pupce and Larvce of Insects, By the 
late Rev. Lansdown Guilding, B.A. F.L.S. &c. 

[In the collection of notes by Mr. Guilding, which we have 
spoken of in p. 558., there are the following, in relation to 
Professor Rennie's remarks on the " Food of the Humming- 
bird," published in I. 371.] 

By far the greater portion of the food of the Trochilidae 
consists of honey. I have often shot humming-birds, through 
whose beaks, when not wounded in the throat, I have sucked 
a teaspoonful of the purest nectar. When the fluid is hard to 
reach, as in the flowers of the /hibiscus i^osa sinensis, I have 
known the calyx pushed aside or perforated ; or the tongue 
passed along the calyx through the petals, when the corolla is 
large and deep, or closed up by the internal organs. They 
do sometimes, indeed, feed on soft insects; but it must be a 
food rarely sought for. In twelve years, I have only seen a 
single instance of a 7>6chilus poised in the centre of a dancing 
swarm of gnats; which, for a considerable time, it continued 
to peck at and devour, though my garden had the blossoms 
in perfection about which it is commonly found. 

Mr. Rennie asserts that birds have little power of suction, 
in consequence of the rigidity of the tongue : he will be sur- 
prised to find how differently constructed is that of the 
humming-bird. I am preparing a drawing to represent the 
details of this organ (so beautiful, complex, and perfect in 
this family) ; which I must send to the Linnaean Society, as it 
cannot be well represented by a wood-engraving. 

The tongue is long, sublinear, and capable of considerable 
protrusion. Its principaly/T^ portion consists of two diapha- 
nous united tubes (fistulae vel tubi nectariferi [Mr. Guilding 
has added, in a footnote : like the tubes in the antlia of le- 
pidopterous insects]), pouring the nectar, by suction and 
capillary attraction, through a common aperture (foramen 
nectariferum), into the oesophagus. At the apex, the tubes 
terminate in two distinct, flattened, acuminate, elastic pro- 
cesses, cut into liplets (labrella), by which the nectar is 
wiped up from the vegetable organs which contain it. 

It may not be improper to add here a few observations 
which occur to me when writing of these splendid ornaments 
of the tropical landscape. 

The spider sometimes proves au enemy to the humming- 



570 Facts on Humming-Birds, 

bird. I have seen the small Trochilus cristatus caught, and 
nearly perishing, in the nets of a spider (which I purpose to 
describe, from its pretty coat of burnished silver, and the 
singularity of its characters). This bird, though remarkable 
for strength of wing, was unable to extricate itself: indeed, 
the yellow threads of this spider, pressing across the face, 
or touched by the finger, afford a resistance which would 
hardly be credited by those who have only noticed [the nets 
of] the smaller species of Europe. [The net of the Euro- 
pean Epeira diadema has the spiral lines of it studded with 
globules of gum: see V. 691, 692. This gum contributes 
very much to the detention of objects which have come in 
contact with the net : the nets of some tropical species may 
be similarly gunnned.] Small birds are sometimes, also, held 
in captivity, as well as hosts of insects, by the seeds of various 
plants furnished with pedunculated glutiniferous glands ; or 
those singular microscopic multiform prickles and hooks by 
which nature has intended they shall adhere to passing ani- 
mals, and be thus scattered over the earth. 

It lias not been noticed how these humming-birds connect 
their nests. These ingenious mechanics would find it impos- 
sible to construct their egg-shell nidus, as other birds do, from 
grasses and sticks, on account of its minuteness ; but in 
stolen cobwebs an admirable substitute is found. The interior 
is softened with the silken pappus [down] of the y!/sclepias 
curassavica, and the exterior defended by a coating of moss 
and lichens : the whole being bound together by the webs of 
spiders. In my stable, I often see the bird poised in the air, 
and collecting these necessary materials. 

Trochilus cristatus sometimes deviates from its usual 
habits. In general it is remarkably wild, and soon disturbed ; 
when it darts away through the air with the velocity of an 
arrow. I once, however, saw a pair of this species almost 
domesticated, in the house of a gentleman, whose kindness 
and humanity had brought round him many a lizard and 
•winged pet. They built for many years on the chain of the 
lamp suspended over the dinner-table; and here they edu- 
cated several broods, in a room occupied hourly by the family. 
I have been seated with a large party at the table, when the 
parent bird has entered; and, passing along the faces of the 
visiters, displaying his gorgeous crest, has ascended to the 
young without alarm or molestation. 

Mr. Rennie's supposition [I. 372.], that all nectariphagous 
birds will be found, on proper scrutiny, to feed on insects 
exclusively, is equally void of foundation. The tongue of the

Nectarineae, though much more simple, is well adapted, from 
its expanded, ciliate, or spinose tip, for taking up the nec- 
tareous juices, which are yielded by plants much more pro- 
fusely than Mr. Rennie supposes [I. 37 1.]* 
ISL Vincent, May 1. 1830.]- 

[Mr. Sells has related, in V. 473, 474., two instances of 
hummin<:r-birds iiidificatinoj in domestic situations. He has 
also presented, in p. 474., facts, and argument from them, in 
proof that the humming-birds feed on the nectar of flowers. 
Mr. Waterton has remarked, in his Wanderings in South 
America (see an extract from them in our V. 475, 476.), that 
" it seems to be an erroneous opinion that the humming- 
bird feeds entirely on honey-dew," that is, the nectar of 
flowers ; and that, "on opening the stomach of the humming- 
bird, dead insects are almost always found there." Mr. 
Waterton, besides using, in these remarks, the words " en- 
tirely " and " almost," has also this observation, quoted in 
our V. 475. : — " See it [the humming-bird] darting through 
the air almost as quick as thought ! Now it is within a yard of 
your face : in an instant, gone ! Now it flutters from flower 
to flower, to sip the silver dew," &c. From these expressions, 
we may learn that, while Mr. Waterton has taught that the 
humming-birds feed on insects, he has not denied that they 
also partake of the nectareous juices of flowers. 

Wilson, also, according to Professor Rennie, in our I. 
371., " found, upon repeated dissection, that the Trochilus 
colubris had a quantity of insects in its stomach, either whole 
or in fragments." 

Our correspondent O. has communicated, in VII. 510., 
some facts on the habits of the Tiochilus colubris, as observed 
by him in Lower Canada. We believe, with him, " that 
very little honey is secreted in flowers while the sun is shining 
hot upon them ; " but the absence of the humming-bird during 
the middle of the day, which he has attributed to this cause, 
is ascribed to another by Mr. Waterton : see in V. 476. 

Other information on humming-birds will be found in V. 
676., VII. 71. 90. For notices of Sir William Jardine's 
Natural History of Humming' Birds, in two volumes, with 
coloured figures of many of the species, see VI. 259., VII. 90.

bee (Bombus terrestris)," " the nectaries of the common co- 
lumbine" were the subject of its perforations, and the mode 
in which it perforated them, this : — " The bee settles on the 
outside of the flower looking upwards, then bites a small hole 
in the nectary with its mandibles, and instantly thrusts its pro- 
boscis into the aperture." The observer of this fact has 
added : — " On examining a number of flowers, not less than 
250, I found that at least two thirds of them were thus per- 
forated."] 

\_Preserving the Eggs of Humming-Birds and those of other 
Birdsr}^ — The eggs even of the smallest humming-birds cannot 
be long kept in hot countries. They retain for some time in 
our cabinets their natural colour, but afterwards become dis- 
coloured, and burst: they should all be emptied, and injected 
with plaster of Paris, or chalk made into a paste. Small 
perforated brass or silver points of this shape should be always 
at hand. [The drawings represent two miniature funnels; 
one about an inch long, with the upper or receiving part 
cylindrical, but the greater portion of its length composed of 
the conducting part, which is gracefully tapered to a fine point ; 
the other funnel is shorter, less slenderly tapered, and its point 
not so fine : each is represented as banded with a ring in relief 
round the centre of the cylindrical portion of its length, as if 
to render holding by the finger and thumb more ready.] A 
small aperture is to be made at each end of the ^g^i rather 
laterally, and, one of the tubes being fixed on a goose quill, 
the contents are to be expelled by blowing. A common pewter 
syringe is then to be filled with the paste, and, the tube being 
pressed on its point, the Q^g is filled in a moment. Any 
ingenious silversmith could make them neatly : the only dif- 
ficulty is in filing away the metal carefully from the point. 
They are very useful at all times ; in 

The Injection of Pupce and Larvce, the Bodies of Spiders, 
and other fleshy and. perishable Objects, [Mr. Guilding has, 
in another note relative to the query on preserving spiders, in 
II. 291., pursued this subject.] 

Spiders, I find, are easily preserved hy means of the per- 
forated pointed tubes I have above alluded to. Sand, or 
any heavy substance, should be avoided in distending them. 
Process: — Puncture the abdomen rather laterally beneath ; 
gently press out the contents on a rag, and with the forceps 
remove the remaining viscera : place the pin in the thorax 
on the right side ; take the tube on a quill, and distend the 
abdominal skin with air: fill the syringe, with its tube, with 
any size-preparation (see Pole's Anatomical Instructor) used

for fine injections, or with thick flour-paste, or even [paste of] 
pounded chalk, and inject gently till every part is plump and 
well extended. Let the specimen hang up to dry for a few 
hours till the injection is firm ; then clean the aperture with a 
penknife, and extend the legs as you would those of insects. 
I have minute spiders as well as the giant ^ranea «vicularia 
Z. [ikTygale «vicularia W.']; dull-coloured kinds, as well 
as those clad in robes of gold and silver [see in p. 570.]j 
so well preserved, that they could not be told from living 
specimens ; and all is done in less time than is taken to describe 
the process. In my case of preserving instruments, I have 
coloured powders to tinge the injections : but they are seldom 
used. A small portion of corrosive sublimate or arsenic 
mixed with it would expel mites, but this would not be ne- 
cessary in well-kept camphorated cabinets.

Art. V. The Accumulation of all possible Information respecting 
the Habits of the Rock Birds of Britain, by the cooperative 
Agency of Naturalists residing near Headlands on the Coasts, 
suggested. By J. D. Salmon, Esq. 

In the notices with which naturalists have favoured us of 
the arrival in, and departure from, Britain of the birds of 
passage, they have confined themselves, for the most part, to 
the species which visit, for the purpose of incubation, during 
summer, the interior of the country ; while scarcely any 
information has been published on the migratory movements 
of the equally numerous species of rock birds; although some 
of these, like a greater part of the others, leave, on the 
approach of autumn, their place of nidification, to migrate to 
other countries, from north to south, or vice versa, 

I wish to draw the attention of those who reside nearest 



S'{i Arrival, Breeding, 'Departure, and 

the different headlands along the coast to this latter subject, 
as these are the places usually resorted to by these birds. 
To this end I have drawn up, from Martin's Voyage to St. 
Kilda, the annexed statements ; and, although I am aware 
that they may be very imperfect, I am induced, by the re- 
flection that no other work offers so much information upon 
the subject proposed, to submit them ; and I hope that they 
will prove a means of inducing a contribution of much inform- 
ation, additional, and, where necessary, corrective. 

It will be perceived that the inhabitants of St. Kilda con- 
sider the state of the wind and weather as having a great in- 
fluence on the arrival, &c., of some of the birds. 

In relation to the subject generally, 1 may quote as follows, 
from a letter received, this summer, from a friend at the Isle 
of Wight; — "The birds never leave the cliffs altogether, 
but keep coming, through the winter and spring, at short 
intervals, up to the time of breeding. The first eggs taken 
this year of the guillemots and razorbills were obtained on 
May 1.; eggs of the herring gull, on May 4. On May 13., 
I procured eggs of these in abundance, quite fresh. Puffms 
and shags sitting, the former having ceased laying." Is it 
not probable that these sJiort intervals are caused by the state 
of the weather, which may more or less affect their acquisition 
of food ? 

Many species that are supposed to inhabit only the sea 
shore are to be found in other situations : the ring dottrel 
(Charadrius hiaticula), provincially called the stonehatch, is to 
be met with abundantly on all the rabbit warrens in the in- 
terior of this county [Norfolk] during the breeding season, 
usually making its appearance in the middle of February, and 
taking its departure in about the end of August. The first 
appearance of birds of this species, last spring, upon an 
adjoining warren was on Feb. 16.; they were sitting on 
March 30. ; and had all taken their departure previously to 
August 25., to the sea coast, I presume.

Fulmar [Procelldria glacidlis Lin.). — Arrival. In Novem- 
ber; the sure messenger of evil tidings, being always accom- 
panied with boisterous west winds, great snow, rain, or hail. 
Breeding. Commonly lays its egcr about the 1st, 2d, or 3d 
day of May. The young ones are hatched in the middle of 



Habits of the Mock Birds of Britain, 5^5 

June, and are ready to take wing before July 20. Departure, 
Stays there all the year, except the month of September, and 
part of October. Remarks. A sure prognosticator of the 
west wind. If it comes to land, no west wind is to be ex- 
pected for some time ; but if it keeps at sea, or goes to sea 
from the land, whether the wind blows from the south, north, 
or east, or there is a perfect calm, its keeping the sea is 
always a certain presage of an approaching west wind. 

Lavy^ or Foolish Guillemot {U^ria Troile Lath.). — Arrival. 
With a south-west wind, if fair, Feb. 20. Breeding. No 
remark. Departure. Depends upon the inhabitants' taking 
or leaving its first, second, or third egg. Remarks. If it stays 
upon land for the space of three days without intermission, it 
is a sign of southerly wind and fair weather; but, if it goes to 
sea before the third expires, it is then a sign of a storm. 

Falk, or Razorbill [A.' lea Torda Lin.). — Arrival. No 
remark. Breeding. Lays its egg in May ; its young take 
wing in the middle of July. Departure. No remark. 

Solan Goose {Velecdnus Bassdnus Lin.). — Arrival. About 
the middle of March, with a south-west wind, warm snow 
or rain. Breeditig. They continue to pluck grass for their 
nests from their coming till the young fowl is ready to fly 
in August or in September. Departure. According as 
the iniiabitants determine the time, i. e., by taking away or 
leaving its first, second, or third egg. Remarks. There is a 
tribe of barren Solan geese, which have no nests, and sit upon 
the bare rock ; these are not the yoimg fowls of a year old, 
whose dark colour would soon distinguish them, but old ones, 
in all things like the rest. 

Bowger^ or Puffin i^K!lca drctica Lin.). — Arrival, With a 
south-west wind, about March 22. Breeding. Lay their egg 
April 22., and produce a fowl May 22., if their first egg be 
not taken away. Departure. No remark. 

Scraber, or Shearwater [Pi'ocelldria PufFinus Lin.). — Ar^ 
rival. In March, and in the nighttime, without regard to any 
wind. Breeding. Its nest is very far under ground, whence 
the bird never comes in daylight. Departure. Goes away in 
August, if its first egg be spared. Remarks. It is never to 
be seen but in the night, being all the day either abroad 
fishing, or upon its nest. 

Assilag, or Sto7^m Petrel {Procellaria pelagica Lin.). — 
Arrival. About March 22., without any regard to winds. 
Breeding. Produces the fowl towards the middle of October. 
Departure. Goes away about the end of November. 

Reddag^ [supposed) Kittiwake {J^rus Rissa Lin.). — Arrival, 
April 15., with a south-west wind. Breeding, Lays its egg 



576 RocJc Birds of Britain, 

about the middle of May. Departure, Goes away in the 
month of August. Remarks. There are three sorts of sea 
malls (gulls) here ; the first of a grey colour, like a goose ; 
the second considerably less, and of a grey colour ; and the 
third sort white, and less in size than a tame duck, called 
reddag. 

Gair Fowl, or Great Auk {AUca impennis Lin.). — Arrival, 
May 1., without regard to any wind. Breeding. Lays its egg 
upon the bare rock ; and, if it be taken away, it lays no more 
for that year. Departure. Goes away about the middle of 
June. 

Jirma^ or Oyster-Catcher [Hcematopus ostralegus.). — Arrival. 
In May. Breeding. No remark. Departure. Goes away in 
August. Remarks. If it comes the beginning of May, it is a 
sign of a good summer ; if later, the contrary is observed. 

The inhabitants observe, that, when the April moon goes 
far into May, the fowls are ten or twelve days later in laying 
their eggs than they usually are. Every fowl lays an egg 
three different times, except the gair fowl (great auk) and 
fulmar, which lay but once. If the first or second egg be 
taken away, every fowl lays but one other egg that year, ex- 
cept the sea malls (gulls), and they usually lay the third egg^ 
whether the first or second egg be taken away or not. 

[In V. 415 — 425. there is a communication of much in- 
terest by Mr. Salmon himself, consisting of " Observations 
on the Eggs and Birds which were met with in a Three 
Weeks' Sojourn in the Orkney Island's."] 



[The state of weather must much influence the movements 
of the rock birds. Mr. Macgillivray (in his account of 
the Outer Hebrides in Cheek's FAin. Joiirn. of Nat, and 
Geograph, Science, i. 249.), in a sketch of a winter tempest 
witnessed from a headland of the west coast of Harris, has 
these words : — " No sign of life is to be seen, save when a 
gull, labouring hard to bear itself up against the blast, hovers 
overhead, or shoots athwart the gloom like a meteor. Long 
ranges of giant waves rush in succession towards the shores. 
The thunder of the shock echoes among the crevices and 
caves; the spray mounts along the face of the cliffs to an 
astonishing height ; the rocks shake to their summit, and the 
baffled wave rolls back to meet its advancing successor. If 
one, at this season, venture, by some slippery path, to peep 
into the haunts of the cormorant and rock pigeon, he finds 
them huddled together in melancholy silence. For whole 
days and nights they are sometimes doomed to feel the gnaw-

ings of hunger, unable to make way against the storm ; and 
often, durhig the winter, they can only make a short daily 
excursion in quest of a precarious morsel of food." 

Similar storms may obtain at the time and place of the 
intended departure of any species of bird, and cause it to 
defer its migration until a more conducive state of weather is 
established.] 



Art. VT. On the Habits and Note of the Grey Wagtail, and on 
the Note of the Spring WagtaiL By T. G., of Clitheroe, Lan- 
cashire. 

We have the grey wagtail with us the whole year ; but it 
is rather a rare bird at all times, and in all the localities for it 
with which I am acquainted. I very strongly suspect that 
Selby is mistaken about this bird when he says, that, " pre- 
vious to its departure in September, it assembles in small 
flocks or families, which haunt the meadows or bare pas- 
tures." This does not agree with my observations on it; 
although it is quite true, if applied to the spring wagtail. 
On the contrary, the grey wagtail, which stays with us through 
the winter, is a solitary bird, except in the breeding season ; 
and the young ones, which certainly associate in broods for a 
month or two after leaving the nest, are dispersed before 
September. As to their frequenting the meadows and bare 
pastures, although I see them at all times of the year (and a 
pair or two breed, every year, near my house), and although 
they are birds with whose peculiar note and habits I am as 
well acquainted as I am with those of the house sparrow, yet 
I have never known them frequent the fields at any time. As 
far as I have observed them, they invariably seek their food 
on the beds of the rivers, brooks, and ditches ; where their 
shrill note often betrays them to persons who would otherwise 
never see them. 

This bird may be distinguished from the spring wagtail, 
very easily, by its note, at any time, but particularly when 
flying ; yet, notwithstanding that the difference is very appa- 
rent to a person who hears both, it is not so easy to describe it. 
In attempting to do this, 1 hope, therefore, I shall be excused 
if I do not make it so obvious in the description as it is in 
reality. The latter part of the note of the grey wagtail is a 
little higher in the musical scale than the former part; and it 
is very staccato. Thus : —

It is also softer and sweeter than the note of the grey wagtail ; 
which bird, like the water ouzel, is fond of the letter z. I do 
not, of course, mean it to be understood that these notes are 
either of the same pitch, or that they bear the same relation to 
each other that the notes of the birds do, but intend the 
sketches as rude attempts at illustrating what I could not so 
well explain in any other way. 

I have been amused with a singular habit which I have 
noticed in several individuals of the grey wagtail. They were 
fond of looking at their own images in the windows, and 
attacking them ; uttering their peculiar cry, pecking, and flut- 
tering against the glass, as earnestly as if the object they saw 
had been a real rival, instead of an imaginary one : or, per- 
haps, they were only admiring themselves, and testifying 
their satisfaction in this way. It is remarkable that two of 
these instances were in the autumn, when the same motives 
for either love or animosity, which would be likely to actuate 
them in the spring, would no longer exist. The first of these 
instances occurred when I was a boy, and was repeated daily, 
and almost hourly, both against the windows of my father's 
house, and those of that of our neighbour ; who, being rather 
superstitious, was alarmed about it, and came to consult my 
mother on the subject. She said there was a bird, which, her 
brother had told her, was a barley-bird (Motacilla flava), 
which was continually flying against her windows ; and, as 

* Persons conversant with the habits of birds will readily comprehend 
me : for the sake of those who are not, I will just observe that the flight 
of all the wagtails is very peculiar ; being a succession of great leaps in 
the air (if I may be allowed the expression), which form a series of curves ; 
the bird rising considerably at the commencement of each effort, and sinking 
again at the close. [See, in IV. 418., Mr. Main's remarks on the mode 
of flight of the families " of Loxia, Pyrrhula, Emberiza, and i'Vingilla."]

birds were not in the habit of doing so at any other time, 
she thought some serious calamity was portended by it. My 
mother comforted her as well as she could ; and 1 undertook 
to rid her of the annoyance. By setting a horse-hair noose 
on one of the window-ledges which it was in the habit of fre- 
quenting, I soon caught it; and, by plucking out the under tail- 
coverts, which I wanted to dress j/fZ/ow ^?i«5 with, I effectually 
cured it of the propensity, whether the stimulus had been 
love or hatred; whether, Narcissus-like [see VI. 513, 51 4.], 
it was in an ecstasy of self-admiration ; or whether, like the 
cock which attacked its own image in the boot (and which 
Mr. Robert Warren's poet and painter have exalted to lasting 
fame), it would admit of no rival.

Thje Luminous Matter of the 'Lampyridce of the Tropics 
seems to afford a much stronger and more durable light than 
that of the glowworm of England (I. 156. ; VII. 250.) ; which 
faintly sheds 

" A beam of soften'd splendour through the gloom. 

And feeds his lamp in solitude's recess." 

The matter taken from the vesicles, and rubbed on the wall, 
long retains its brilliance, after the manner of phosphoric pre- 
parations. The occurrence, too, of luminous insects in Britain 
is more rare. Seldom does the same bank support a dozen 
of these inactive midnight sparklers : but what can equal the 
splendour of those fairy scenes which the inhabitant of the 
tropics has nightly before his eyes ? The fireflies of the 
West Indies, 

" Stars of the earth, and diamonds of the night," 

are said to be more numerous in rainy weather : the truth, 
perhaps, is, that, in dark and cloudy evenings, their tiny lamps 
and coruscations are more visible, and attract greater notice. 
As twilight dies away you see, at one step, some gigantic tree 
peopled by these magic rovers glowing with all the green, 
the gold, and emerald lustre of precious stones.

Around 



Myriads of insect meteors, living lamps 
People the glittering air ; a fairy world." 

At another step, some long lane in the darkness of night 
seems to have been consumed by fire, and to be throwing up 
its last expiring sparks. The insects, as they present their 
backs, conceal their floating lantern for a moment, and render 
the resemblance perfect, 

" And every hedge and copse is bright. 
With the quick firefly's playful light ; 
Like thousands of the sparkling gems. 
Which blaze in Eastern diadems." 

Presently, with a steady and bold sweeping course, the lumi- 
nous E'later (E. noctilucus //.) crosses your path, 

" A meteor swift and bright 

And the wide space around, on high. 
Gleams with his emerald light." 

It forms a strong contrast to the twinkling phosphoric fires of 
the lesser stars, and resembles a wax taper borne rapidly 
through the gloom, by some invisible hand : while the ear is 
assailed by countless tribes of sonorous insects, and frogs 
raising their nuptial cries. 

How glorious is such a scene ! From the innumerable 
host of insects which light up the earth, and from their proxi- 
mity to the eye of the spectator, they have all the brilliance 
of real stars. Above our heads is the broad firmament of 
stationary lights ; below is a second firmament of luminous 
points, moving with all the eccentric courses of comets and 
meteoric balls, and with all the glory that tracks the shooting 
stars. [See V. 672.] 

\_Luminous Meteors, (A note made in relation to the remarks 
on ^' Fallmg Stars " in II. 305.).] — The meteors called falling 
stars are very common in these islands. I lately observed 
one of vast magnitude traversing slowly the Bay of Kingston, 
a most splendid body, and at a very trifling elevation. 

Jg?ies Fatui. (I. 156.) — The reviewer is undoubtedly right 
in his supposition that the far-famed ignes fatui, 

" Which dance and glimmer on the marshy mead," 
may sometimes owe their origin to the phenomena attending 
the gaseous exhalations of the earth. They sometimes also 
proceed [as the reviewer has deemed probable] from the 
lanterns of luminous insects. When a boy in Worcester- 
shire, I have repeatedly seen these 



aerial lights betray 



And charm, th' unwary wanderer from his way ;" 
and from comparison with the motions of luminous animals, 



Change of Colour in Lizards, 581 

which I have since seen in other lands, I have no doubt what- 
ever of their origin. In the generality of cases, perhaps, 
these hghts proceed from orthopterous ? or other insects at- 
tached to swampy grounds, and luminous only during the 
season of their nuptials. 

Lumijioiisness cfthe Sea, (I. 156.) — The most satisfactory 
information on the luminousness of the sea, and the animals 
producing these lovely sparks, will be found in one of the 
numbers of Thomson's Zoological Researches [see IV. ^BG,'], 
a work, of course, in the hands of all naturalists. While sailing 
in the more shallow })arts of the Caribbean Sea, and looking 
over the vessel's side when becalmed in these dangerous waters, 
in the midst of reefs, 1 have seen at the bottom huge molluscous 
or radiate animals emitting the splendour of a lamp, but could 
never ascertain the species. 

Putrescent matter is occasionally highly luminous in the 
West Indies. [Mr. Guilding has a note, in another part, upon 
the remarks of some correspondents given in II. 209. — The 
gelatinous mass containing portions of the frog was probably 
vomited by the heron. I have known similar matter in the 
West Indies to become highly phosphorescent.] 

It has been already observed that the larvae of some insects 
emit light. The larva of an E'later ? as far as I can determine, 
was lately sent to me, which was said, by the respectable 
person from whom I obtained it, to have been very luminous 
between every segment of the abdomen. 

The Vohintary Changing of Colour in Several Genera of 
Liizards^andmore especially in Qhamccleon and Anblis. (1. 157.) 
— There is not in nature a more singular phenomenon than this. 
The mode of effectinff this miraculous chan^je does not seem 
to have been yet fully determined. It may depend upon some 
small, peculiar, and supplementary system of vessels pouring 
a coloured fluid to the integuments, or withdrawing it from 
the skin; or it may proceed from the more simple action of 
the arterial system, from the rapidity or lethargy of the cir- 
culation : though one would suppose a temporary stagnation 
would deprive the creature of all activity. It is strange that 
the power is within the perfect control of the lizard, and is not 
abandoned even at the eager moment of springing on the prey. 

The passions of the human mind do indeed change the 
colour of the face, and distort the countenance; but these 
changes indicative of strong feeling are transitory, if not mo- 
mentary, and almost in all cases involuntary : whereas the 
lizards can regulate this protean power for hours, days, or 
months. By inflating the body, the numerous scales might be 
separated to certain degrees, and thus aflect the general colour- 

p p 3 



582 Change of Colour ifi Lizards, 

ing : but I do not observe that the outline of the Anolidae is at 
all altered, however great may be the varying of the tints. 

The number of a green species of Anolis (Zacerta bullaris 
L., from its throat being supposed to be inflated into a ball : 
the Anolis variabilis Guild,, variable) is, in some of our 
islands perfectly incredible, and one only wonders that the 
race of insects is not extinct. Indeed, one never sees here 
moths and other objects settling on walls and trees, as in 
England : from the danger of such exposure, it often happens 
that insects whose larvae are readily obtained for breeding are 
never taken in a state of liberty. 

On large trees whole families of lizards are actively employed 
in their insect chase, while every rock, fence, or smaller tree, 
has one at least resting in readiness for its prey, or jumping 
from spray to spray with its sucker-bearing toes. Yet few 
will be found alike in colouring, though there are some toler- 
ably permanent varieties. The general unassumed colour is a 
lively yellowish green : yet this is varied at will, and changed 
to grey, dark dirty brownish green, or is curiously varied. 
The aspect of each individual is adapted admirably to the spot 
it chooses as a cruising ground, which it commonly retains, 
unless disturbed, for very long periods ; a fact which is easily 
determined by the notice of mutilated individuals. 

But, whatever may be the assumed colouring of the indi- 
vidual, place it in confinement, and its mask is withdrawn as 
if by magic, and the bright green of nature is restored. 

If a dark mass of volcanic trap [rock] is selected for a 
cruising station, the darkest colour is adopted : if the light 
foliage of trees and plants is preferred, a tint is acquired 
resembling its resting-place, and calculated for concealment 
and deception. 

[In another place, Mr. Guilding has noted thus ; in relation 
to the remarks, in II. 469., on " the chamaeleon's antipathy 
to black :" — Many of our lizards reside constantly on the 
darkest rocks blackened by the air, and decayed cryptogamic 
plants : in which case the skin assumes a corresponding tint.] 

In these cases the mute sexes separated from each other 
would have difficulty in meeting during the season of their 
loves ; but nature, without enforcing the necessity of their 
returning to their proper colour, which would betray them to 
their prey and their enemies, has given to the diurnal species, 
which alone can need it, a retractile dewlap process, of a light 
and striking colour, which is never altered ; of larger size in 
the males, which, with a vertical motion of the head, is often 
extended into a broad membrane to attract the notice of the 
other sex, as birds are known to display their plumose and 
other ornamental appendages for the like object. 



Guana. Lizards, 583 



I had once tlioiigbt that at the time of developement from 
the egg, the colour was determined, and the animal Iiad only 
to proceed in search of a spot suited to the natural varieties 
of its coat : but this idea is immediately contradicted by a 
captured specimen placed under a vase. 

The Guana has in its youth much more lovely colours than 
its parents ; and, during the periods of casting off the cutaneous 
exuviag, the tints of lizards are affected: but the power of 
change in the chamjeleons and the Anolidae is altogether as 
voluntary and premeditated as it is inexplicable. In the latter 
tribe it is not, perhaps, so rapid as it is said to be in the 
former. 

[In another part of Mr. Guilding's notes, there is the fol- 
lowing remark on the guana, made in reply to the cjuery on 
" edible lizards " in I. 495. 

The common guana is eaten over the whole West Indies, 
and is reckoned equal in delicacy to a rabbit or fricasseed 
chicken. The eggs, also, are said to be delicious. I have a 
friend who shoots all he can find, and purchases every one 
brought to him, for his table.] 

I may probably institute a course of experiments on our 
lizards, and communicate the results in a future Number. 

[These results have not been communicated to us. As this 
remark was written in 1830, and the author died in 1832, he 
might not have instituted the experiments.] 

[^Lizards like Miisic.'] — The assertion that spiders are at- 
tracted by music (I. 158.) is by no means incredible. Every 
child in the West Indies is aware how much the lizards are 
delighted with musical sounds, and how quickly they are 
drawn from distant spots to listen to the melody. I often 
whistle to some curious listener, and can easily discern his 
delight at my rude attempts : his ears are turned in mute 
attention, his eyes are soon closed, and he is totally absorbed 
and absent. In this state it is of course easily destroyed. 

Our Common Green Species is a harmless, pretty, graceful, 
and useful animal : in houses where they are protected and 
caressed, I have known them tame enough to eat sugar from 
one's hand. As in other species, the mutilated tail soon buds, 
and is restored, and sometimes with monstrous appendages, 
or multiplication. Cats which feed on them, on my grape 
arbours, where tiiey are troublesome among the ripe fruit, 
grow lean and sickly.

with numerous small tubular papillae, which clothe the whole 
surface, and follow no pattern in their arrangement. When 
contracted, nothing more is to be seen than a small circular

orifice at both ends ; but, if the creature is carefully watched 
for some time, it may be observed to shorten and dimple the 
anterior by an involution of the skin, and again protrude it ; 
and then it may, perchance, to your amazement, suddenly 
evolve and display its circle of tentacula {b). Of these there 
are eight large and equal, and two very small ones placed 
together : they originate in the circumference of the cir- 
cular lip, by a thick round stalk, which sends off numerous 
divided branchlets, so that each assumes an arborescent form, 
of a brown colour, speckled with darker dots. In the centre 
of these beautiful organs we find the mouth, an aperture of 
considerable size, and armed with an apparatus of bones 
somewhat similar to that of those of the Echinus : it consists 
often pieces, five of which seem divisible into halves by a fine 
scarcely visible longitudinal suture, and are prolonged below 
into two slender prongs ; but the other five which alternate 
with them, are truncate below, being pointed above with a 
tooth ; the first pieces having two similar teeth in close appo- 
sition. The margins of the pieces are minutely serrulate to 
favour their firmer union, which is principally effected by 
ligaments ; and the whole are bound together by a strong 
broad ligamentous band, which completely encircles them ; 
tendons passing on the inner surface of it to the roots of the 
tentacula, and others to and between the upper extremities of 
the osseous pieces, for the purpose, undoubtedly, of moving 
and contracting them. Between this band and the osseous ap- 
paratus, there are five oblong compressed fleshy glands, free 
beneath, but with a narrow pedicel at their origins, probably 
a canal leading to the gullet, for these are presumed to be 
the salivary organs, although their size and number would 
seem to indicate a function more important to the animal's 
welfare than the salivary glands are deemed to be in higher 
organisms.* The stomach is placed immediately under the 
oral apparatus : it is about half an inch in length, and very little 
wider than the intestine, but of a whiter colour, and with 
much stronger coats, the inner surface being strongly plaited 
and puckered in a longitudinal direction. The intestinal 
canal is about twice the length of the body, and must con- 
sequently have a tortuous course ; it is furnished with a 
narrow mesentery, is of a brown colour, equal in calibre 
throughout, or only slighdy dilated towards its termination, 
which is circular and plain, with a stricture immediately above 
it. The coats are smooth on both surfaces, but, under a mag-

nifier, circular fibres become very visible, and numerous 
minute dots are sprinkled among them. 

The surface of the body was at first partially covered with 
fragments of shells and corallines, which were evidently re- 
tained by the suctorial property of the papillae ; and the 
animal, on being kept a day in sea water, threw them off. It 
had a slow progressive motion, slower than the shadow on 
the dial, which was effected by elongatmg the papillae of one 
part, fixing them to the plate, and then drawing itself forward 
by again contracting these elongated parts ; but the papillae 
were much oftener used for the purpose of anchors than of 
feet, the creature being of an indolent and immovable cha- 
racter. When stationary, it was ever slowly changing its 
outward form : it was now shortened, and swollen in the 
centre; then it would relax itself, and become cylindrical; 
again, one part would be blown out and another drawn in, 
with a deep stricture, as if a thread had been tied round ; or, 
again, the contraction would begin near the head, which is 
then made very narrow, and would spread backwards, the 
anterior portion recovering its original diameter as the wane 
of constriction passed away ; and sometimes the contraction 
will spread in the opposite direction. It often raised the 
posterior extremity a little from the surface of the plate, and 
to one side, but I never saw any current to flow from this 
aperture. To effect these varied motions, we must suppose 
the existence of muscular bands or fibres in the coriaceous 
skin, both in a longitudinal and circular direction ; and, on 
opening the body, we find such to be the case (e) : five strong 
white raised bands run from one end to the other, radiating 
from the circular apertures ; and numerous fibres pass be- 
tween them transversely, among which minute pores open 
everywhere, which are the inner orifices of the cuticular 
papillae. 

The ovaries {/), which are of a flesh colour, lie towards 
the centre of the body, attached to the sides in a large cluster, 
or, at least, there was one cluster only left in the specimen be- 
fore us, for it had ejected many ovaries before dissection. Each 
ovary (y) is half an inch long, cylindrical, with a short 
narrow pedicel at the end of attachment; and the ova are 
very visible through the thin membranous coat. They lie 
without any order, are somewhat globular, and enveloped in 
a transparent pellicle of nutritive jelly ; and on one side there 
was a drop of an amber-coloured and apparently oily 
fluid. 

Towards the posterior end, and reaching from the anus 
about one third up the body, there was a thin membrane laid 



Phylline grossa.

over, and, of course, internal to the muscular bands, which 
was spread over with a small quantity of brown grumous 
matter ; but I saw no organs which could be supposed sub- 
servient to the office of respiration there. 

The worm, having been kept in sea water unchanged for 
two or three days, sickened, and, by the more frequent in- 
volutions and evolutions of its oral end, evidenced its uneasi- 
ness. Being left unobserved in this state for an hour or so, I 
found, on my return, that it had vomited up its ten taenia, its 
oral apparatus, its intestinal tube entire and as exhibited in 
our figure (c), and a large cluster of ovaries, which lay 
about the plate ! The muscular convulsion must have been 
very great that thus so completely embowelled the creature ; 
and yet life was not extinct, for the tentacula contracted them- 
selves on being touched ; and the empty skin appeared, by its 
motions, to have lost little of its irritability. It is true, as 
the poet has long since sung, that 

" Nature's store 

Of majesty appeareth more 
In waters, than in all the rest 
Of elements."

Description. — Body 1 A in. long, about six tenths of an 
inch in breadth where broadest; oblong, flat, soft, exannulose, 

roughish, with little granu- 
lations, and of a uniform 
flesh colour. On the upper 
side a small vessel is seen dis- 
tinctly, running down the 
middle of the body, having a 
tortuous course, and termi- 
nating near the sucker ; and 
it lies over a much larger in- 
testine, following the same 
direction, and alone visible 
on the ventral aspect. The 
anterior extremity is rounded, 
somewhat raised above the mouth, which is placed in a 
sinus here, and opens chiefly on the under side ; it is wide, 
edentulous; but, when opened, the inner surface appears 
flocculent, being clothed with longish papilla?, which are 
arranged in close longitudinal series, and cover the whole 
intestinal canal. This organ is nearly of uniform width and 
structure throughout ; but the papilla? appear to be longer 
towards its termination, which is by a small aperture on the

back, just above the sucker. The dorsal vessel begins in a 
sort of swelling above the mouth ; and, after it has passed 
beyond the middle of the body, it becomes sensibly attenuated. 
It is not fibrous, and, indeed, exhibits no marked structure 
beyond a very fine and faint reticulation of the surface when 
exposed under a high magnifier. The space between the 
intestine and margins of the body is compactly filled with 
myriads of oviform bodies, which seem to lie, without any 
particular order, in a gelatinous fluid : they are roundish, 
opaque, and encircled with a rim or pellicle of transparent 
jelly. 

I have twice found this leech in specimens of Cypr/wa 
islandica dredged up in Berwick Bay. They were lurking 
between the cloak and branchiae, and doubtless had sought 
out the site for a less harmless purpose than shelter from foes ; 
but, so far as I could judge from external appearances, the 
oyster had not suffered any material injury. 

On the suggestion of Lamarck, it has been here considered 
a species of Phylline ; but it will not correspond with the 
character of the genus, for the large terminal disk or sucker 
is not armed with hooks, as Lamarck's definition expresses, 
but is quite smooth. Nor has the skin the slightest appear- 
ance of circular rings, or rugae, even when contracted and 
hardened by spirits; and its whole anatomy is so unlike that 
of Annelides, and more especially of the true leeches, that it 
strengthens an opinion of Lamarck's, of there being a class of 
animals, yet unestablished, between the Annelides and the 
worms.

Sir, 
If your correspondent, Mr. Higgins, will consult the forth- 
coming Part of the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana (namely. 
Part xxxix.) when it appears, I flatter myself lie will find, in 
the course of the article on Geology, which it is to contain, 
an answer to most of the objections brought forward, as 
applicable to that theory, by which I have attempted to ex- 
plain the phenomena alluded to. He will at least see discussed 
at considerable length the question, whether the bases of the 
ordinary constituents of lava are likely to be so acted upon 
by water, as to produce the requisite degree of heat in con- 
sequence of its presence. 



JV/iite Negro, 589 

With regard to the supposed impossibility of water pene- 
trating to the depths at which these inflammable substances 
may be imagined to exist, and likewise to the improbability 
of air finding admittance to the same spots, I shall be ready 
to discuss the reasonableness of such a conjecture, when the 
facts, that volumes of steam are constantly issuing from all 
volcanoes, and that azotic gas, either pure or combined with 
hydrogen, is so generally present during all the phases of 
volcanic action, are shown to be referable to other causes than 
the presence of water and air at the spots in which volcanic 
action occurs. 

I have, however, neither time nor inclination at present to 
go over the details of the argument a second time, especially 
as the curiosity of those of your readers who may feel an 
interest in the discussion may be gratified very speedily, if 
you will only transfer to the pages of your Magazine some 
few paragraphs of the article on volcanoes, which will appear 
in the Ericyclopcedia Metropolitana ; and this, probably, quite 
as soon as any remarks with which I might at present trouble 
you would find their way into print.

child's hair was white, but curly, as in the negro race ; the 
nose and lips were European, and the iris of the eye blue. 
It was a healthy, fine child. These varieties, which depend

an account of four of the six white elephants then kept by 
the king of Siam, and says of them, " they showed no sign of 
disease, debility, or imperfection.". ..." Two of them were

described as so vicious, that it was considerci^l unsafe to exhibit 
them." These, we presume, are the two which, added to the 
four mentioned, constitute the six. ..." Each of those which 
we saw had a separate stable, and no less than ten keepers to 
wait upon it," &c. ..." In the stables of the white elephants 
w-e were shown 

" l^joo lwMfe']Monkei/Si whose presence, the keepers insisted, 
preserved their royal charges [the white elephants] from sick- 
ness. These were o^ a pe7yecil^ pure white coIo7ir, and of the 
tribe of monkeys with long tails. They were in perfect health, 
and had been long caught ; but we were advised not to play 
with them, as they were of a sullen and mischievous disposi- 
tion. These were both taken in the forest of Pisiluk, about 
ten days' journey up the Menam. On enquiry, we found all 
the white elephants were either from the kingdom of Lao or 
Kamboja, and none from Siam itself, nor from the Malay 
countries tributary to it; which last, indeed, had never been 
known to afford a white elephant." In England it is believed 
that allowing a goat to subsist among horses promotes the 
health of these.

The Stoats seen in White Fur are Individuals of a White- 
furred Variety. (V. 77. 293--295. 393. 718.) — Zoophilus 
states, in V. 718 — 722., that stoats change their colour at a 
certain period of the year, and become white. I am convinced 
that this is a mistake, and that the white is a distinct variety. 
I have seen them of this colour in every season of the year, 
on what are called the mosses, on the w^estern coast of Lanca- 
shire; and I particularly recollect that, while resident in Wor- 
cestershire, one of these white animals seldom allowed a week 
to pass without showing himself in front of my house, while 
threading the mazes of a fence, which he entered from the 
nearest point of a coppice from which he always sallied. 
This animal would not have excited so much attention, but 
that he invariably pursued his course over a gate-post which 
stood in the fence ; and this constant observance of a singular 
practice obtained him the honour to be distinguished as " tlie 
stoat." The common stoat abounded in the same neighbour- 
hood ; and I, with a clever terrier, captured them at all seasons, 
and always of the same colour. It is possible that the stoat 
changes colour ; but, if he does, I am convinced that it is purely 
an occasional and rare occurrence. — Henry Berry, Bootlcy 
near Liverpool, August 27. ISS^.

ford. — I was rather surprised to see, last winter (1832), which 
was a remarkably mild one, a stoat (Mustela erminea) which 
had donned its snowy garb. I had never seen a white one 
here before. — A. Clifford, Near Stamford. \_Received Dec, 
13. 1833.] 

The Otter domesticated in a Degree, and emploi/ed hy Man in 
capturing Fish. — " We passed, to my surprise, a row of no 
less than nine or ten large and very beautiful otters, tethered 
with straw collars and long strings to bamboo stakes on the 
bank (of the Matta Colly). Some were swimming about at 
the full extent of their strings, or lying half in and half out of 
the water ; others were rolling themselves in the sun, on the 
sandy bank, uttering a shrill whistling noise, as if in play. I 
was told that most of the fishermen in this neighbourhood 
kept one or more of these animals, who were almost as tame 
as dogs, and of great use in fishing ; sometimes driving the 
shoals into the nets, sometimes bringing out the larger fish 
with their teeth. I was much pleased and interested with the 
sight. It has always been a fancy of mine that the poor crea- 
tures whom we waste and prosecute to death, for no cause 
but the gratification of our cruelty, might, by reasonable 
treatment, be made the sources of abundant amusement and 
advantage to us. The simple Hindoo shows here a better 
taste and judgment than half the otter-hunting and badger- 
baiting gentry of England." (Bishop Heher.) 

[For information on the habits of the otter, wild in Britain, 
see p. 507, 508. 538. A fine otter was killed on Jan. 1. 
1828, in the old river Deben, at Letheringham, after seven 
hours' hunt by a bull terrier and a spaniel : its weight was 
29 lbs. ; length, 4 ft. 2 in. ; girth of neck, 1 ft. 2 in. ; pads, or 
feet, 3 in. wide. {Bury and Norwich Post, Jan. 9, 1828.) ] 

Perforation of a Leaden Pipe hy Rats (A: 5 5), — E. S. has 
been, surely, too inattentive to proportions : there is an in- 
consistency in the dimensions of " a leaden pipe about IJ in, 
in external diameter, with a bore of about | in. in diameter; 
thus leaving a solid circumference of metal varying from ^in. 
to fin. in thickness." (p. 455.)— J". R- Sept. 1834. 

[_Rats will pass under Water upon the Mud at the Bottom of the 
Water, — I have seen several instances of this, not in the water 
rat or water campagnol only, but some in the field rat as 
well. The instance which I more particularly remember re- 
lates to two or three of the latter kind of rat, which had shel- 
tered among the large roots, &c., of a couple of elm trees 
which were growing beside a watercourse, of, say, about 10 ft. 
wide. The rats, on being disturbed in the elms, crossed the 
stream beneath the water, and were both visible in their

Birds. — \_ShaJcspeare was an exact Observer of Nature : his 
Notice of the OwVs Manner of Flight. — Mr. Bree had sent us 
the following note for insertion in the proof of his communica- 
tion, in p. 548., but want of space excluded it there.] 

Though the remark may be here somewhat out of place, I 
cannot resist the inclination I feel to draw attention to one 
instance out of very many, in proof of the exquisite accuracy 
and exactness, with which Shakspeare observed objects of 
natural history. The passage I alkide to occurs in Part iii. of 
Henry VL, where Warwick is narrating to Edward the dis- 
astrous result of the battle of St. Albans, and the little effect 
which his troops made on those of Queen Margaret : — 

" Our soldiers' [weapons] — li/ie the nig/ii-oiul's lazyjiight^ 
Or like an idle thresher with a flail, — 
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends." 

None but a nice observer of nature could have made such a 
simile (the force of which lies, too, in a single epithet), nor 
can any reader fully enjoy the passage, who has not noted the 
owl's flight, and the slow, soft, faint strokes of her wings. —

A White Coalhood [Dennrostra atricapilla W.). — On Sept. 
5. 1834-, a bird of a very unusual appearance was observed in 
a hedge near the house, which was at first taken for a canary 
finch (i^ringilla canaria Z>.), but on a nearer approach he 
proved to be a coalhood (Loxia Pyrrhula of Linnaeus). A 
gun was speedily procured and he was shot. He was pure 
white, without a single feather of any other colour, not even 
on the head, the fine glossy black of which gives rise to the 
expressive name " coalhood." [See p. 148., note *.] Bewick 
mentions a similar case, and Selby records an instance of one 
with white wings. There are also instances of 

White Yellowhills \Blackhirds'\ (Turdus Morula Z..). — In 
our collection here, we have one with as much white as black. 
I have also seen

— A friend of mine informs me that some time since he saw 

A Wagtail (Motacilla) ]mre Snow-White : he joined with 
me in regretting that he had not his gun with him at the time. 

With regard to the Scienli^fic Name of the Coalhood, I have 
ventured to suggest Densirostra atricapilla, as being more de- 
finite and expressive than either the name of Linnaeus, Loxia 
Pyrrhula, or that of Temminck, Pyrrhula vulgaris. The

only other British species might then be called (instead of 
Loxia enucleator) Densirostra enucleator, the pine thick- 
bill. The name L6xia has been employed by different authors 
to denote several genera : in Shaw's General Zoology it is ap- 
plied to the thickbills and to the grosbeaks ; by Temminck it 
is applied to the crossbills, and by Linnaeus to all three I This 
confusion might easily be avoided, if the thickbills (of which 
there are only two British species) were called Densirostra : 
the grosbeaks (of which the haw grosbeak may be mentioned 
as an example) might be called Coccothraustes [this name 
Selby adopts], and to the crossbills might be applied the ap- 
pellation Crucirostra, which name is adopted in Shaw's Zoo- 
logy, Of this genus there are, I believe, only three species, 
the common crossbill (C. vulgaris Shaw), the parrot cross- 
bill (C. pinetorum Meyer), and the white-winged crossbill, 
(C. leucoptera Shaw). Selby, in the first edition of his 
British Ornithology, calls the coalhood " bullfinch grosbeak,'^ 
and in the second " common bullfinch ;" thus in the first 
instance making bullfinch the specific, and in the second 
the generic, name : but either way the name is improper, for 
the bird is not a finch at all, and has no more right to the 
appellation than the storm petrel (Thalassidroma pelagica) or 
the pied flycatcher (Muscicapa luctuosa), both of which have 
been called finches ! In these days of wholesale changes 
there may be some who look on (or rather perhaps away from) 
every alteration with suspicion or dislike; but it is but fair 
that they should state their reasons for discarding any new 
proposal, and not do so because it is new. — S. D. W, Sept,

A Nest of Bullfinches {Coalhood Thichhills, as S. D. W,

that he had them preserved. — A. Clifford. Near Stamford,

A Live Young Rook, almost perfectly White, was last year 
brought to me. It was of a dirty white colour, and, what 
rather surprised me, its beak and legs were also of this colour. 
I had wished to bring it up ; but, to my great disappointment, 
it was killed by accident. It was quite young, and I have 
little doubt that, had it lived to attain its full plumage, it 
would have been milk-white. The person who had brought 
it to me said, that he had taken one or two other young ones 
of the natural colour out of the same nest.— ^. Clifford. Near

White, in the letter to Pennant, dated " Selborne, March 



Birds of anomalo2is Plumage, 595

hood had two milk-white rooks in one nest. I saw the birds 
myself, and was surprised to find that their bills, legs, feet, 
and claws, were milk-white." Sir William Jardine, in a note 
on this subject, to his edition of White's Natural History of 
Selborne, has these remarks : — " The common rook seems to be 
more subject to a white variation than its other British con- 
geners. Specimens entirely white are not often seen, but in- 
dividuals, with parts of the wings and tail pure white, occur 
in almost every rookery." 

White Crows we have seen very often, says Captain Thomas 
Brown, in a note to his edition of White's Selborne.

" A Pair of Magpies, entirely of a Cream Colour, were 
hatched at a farm-steading in Eskdale, Dumfriesshire, and,

Jardine, in a note to his White's Selbor?ie.) 

A White Jackdaw has been known, as is clear from this 
remark by Montagu, in Rennie's edition of the Orn. Did. : — 
" Several varieties of this species are given by different au- 
thors; some entirely black, without the grey on the head and 
neck : others quite white, or mixed black and white." Captain 
Brown has seen a white jackdaw: see his notes in his edition 
of White's Selbo7'ne. Mr. Waterton has thus noted, in our 
VI. 396., a jackdaw with white in one of its wings, which had 
occurred in the park of Walton Hall: — " A jackdaw once 
appeared here with a remarkable portion of white in one of 
the wings ; it tarried with us for two years, and then disap- 
peared for ever. Probably the singularity of its wing had 
attracted the fatal notice of some experienced gunner, in its 
peregrinations beyond this vale of safety." 

Of the Starling in White Plumage, instances will be found 
noted in I. 494., V. 284. 

Of the Grey Hen, the Female of the Tetrao Tetria:, a variety 
is noted in II. 90., the ground colour of whose whole plumage 
was " a dusky yellowish white, paler on the under parts, with 
the dark markings of the feathers umber brown." The in- 
dividual was shot: Sir William Jardine had the specimen. 

On the Pheasant in White or Varied Plumage, Mr. Water- 
ton has, in VI. 308., noted the fact of the occurrence of some 
instances, and, in VI. 314., has remarked, that " a white male 
pheasant has taken up his abode here, for seven years, without 
having been once seen to wander half a mile from the house." 



596 Birds of anomalous Plumage, 

In the Montrose Review there appeared, a good while ago, a 
notice of a perfectly white male pheasant, that had been re- 
cently shot at the Hill of Woodstow, and was then in Mr. 
Malleson's museum. 

A White Woodcock was seen three successive winters in 
Penrice Wood, Glamorganshire. {Professor Rennie in p. 
562. of his Mont, Orn. Diet.) The fact is quoted from Bewick, 
who had derived it from Sir John Trevelyan, Bart. 

A White S?iipe was once met with by two gentlemen shoot- 
ing in Ireland, as one of them has told me. — J. D. 

Of a Water Rail, every Feather of which was of a pure 
TV/lite, an instance is registered in V. 3 84- . " The rich coral 
colour of the beak formed a singular and beautiful contrast 
to the delicate hue of the plumage." 

White Blackbirds (or Yellowbills, as S. D. W. has ingeni- 
ously called them above, to avoid a contradiction in terms) 
seem not of very rare occurrence. Besides the instances re- 
lated by S. D. W., in p. 593., another is registered in III. 
146. A correspondent has supplied the following additional 
one. 

In 1829, a blackbird's nest, containing four or five young 
ones, was found at Rougham, near Bury St. Edmunds, Suf- 
folk. One of the young ones differed in colour materially from 
the rest. Its eyes w^ere red, its bill was yellow (which is not 
usual in very young blackbirds). The nest was not taken till 
the young were fully fledged. On attempting to capture them, 
two or three made their escape ; the white one was safely 
caught : another was captured, after its thigh had been broken ; 
this soon died. The red-eyed bird afterwards became nearly 
or wholly white, and it still retains this colour. Mr. Ely of 
Bury St. Edmunds, the person who reared the bird [in whose 
possession it was anteriorly to May 27- 1829], had received 
repeated offers of a guinea for it ; he ultimately sold it to Mr. 
S. Middleditch ; of whom Mr. Partridge of London pur- 
chased it for 2Z. 105. It is worth noticing that the bird, which 
died with a brokien limb, was remarkably black ; much more 
so than young blackbirds usually are. — Henrif Turner. Bury 
St. Edmunds, March 1. 1833. [Mr. Partridge brought the 
bird to London : I happened to make the journey with him 
and it on Jan. 4. 1833. — J. D. 

Captain Brown, in the same note, in his edition of White's 
Selbo?me, from which we have before quoted, relates these 
instances of blackbirds of unusual colour: — " In the summer 
of 1831, a blackbird's nest was found at Newbottle, near 
Edinburgh, containing four young, two of which were of the 
ordinary colour, and two perfectly white. The former turned

out females, and the latter were both male birds. On the 
grounds of Drumsheugh, the property of our friend Sir Patrick 
Walker, there was, some years ago, a beautifully mottled 
blackbird, which became so tame that it fed along with the 
domestic fowls. ... It is now in the museum of Sir Patrick. 
Another mottled blackbird was, some years ago, kept in a 
cage by Mr. Veitch, optician, Inchbonny." Professor Rennie 
in his Mont. Orn. Did. mentions the fact of the occurrence of 
white blackbirds.]

cent, May 1. 1830. 

A Black Thrush. — A person residing in Liverpool is in pos- 
session of a living thrush, now nearly two years old, which has 
changed the colour of its feathers three times. This singular 
bird, which is of the ordinary size and form of thrushes ge- 
nerally, was taken along with four others from the same nest 
early in the spring, and before it was quite fledged. It was 
then of the usual colour of young thrushes ; but at the end 
of three months its feathers became black, and remained so 
for about nine months, when it again resumed its original 
colour, namely, that of a common thrush. It has always been 
a very healthy bird, and is a famous musician. This singu- 
larity was not exhibited by any of the other birds of the same 
nest, nor have I ever before seen or heard of an instance of 
the kind. — Thomas Weatherill, M.D. Liverpool, Dec. 7.

given in I. 494. ; of another female, in V. 583. note * : this 
last is an interesting case. Montagu has remarked of the 
sparrow, " accidental varieties occur, such as white, black, 
and yellowish.'' Captain Brown has seen " white birds of many 
British species," and a white sparrow is one of these.

The Robin, White. — A white robin was caught, in June, 
1825, in the garden of the rectory at Writhlington, near Rad- 
stock, and it is now in the possession of the Rev. G. Cookson, 
at Writhlington : its eyes are red, its legs and bill yellow.

The Colour of Phimage of the Ringdove is remarkably con- 
slant. — " I know of no British bird," says Mr. Waterton, 
in p. 332., " which has the colour of its plumage so constant 
as is that of the ringdove." 

The Change in the Colours of Birds kept in Confinement is 
referable to the Confinement and the Nature of the Food upon 
Kjohich they are fed. — This seems generally agreed upon. Facts 
in proof of it are given in the case of a goldfinch, in II. 64. ; 
in the case of the Senegal sparrow, goldfinch, and bullfinch, 
in V. 398. ; hempseed is marked as the food most conducive 
to the change. Mr. Yarrell, the author of " Observations 
on the laws which appear to influence the assumption and 
changes of plumage in birds," treatise third, in the Zoological 
Society's Transactions, has concluded, as we liave stated in VI. 
502., that " feathers are influenced by constitutional power, 
and their colour affected as the secretions alter under constitu- 
tional changes." Those who can make access to this excellent 
treatise will not omit to peruse it. It may be objected that 
all this has rather little to do with birds produced white from 
the egg ; but the case of these is inseparable ; there must have 
been a cause for the whiteness, whatever may have been that 
cause.] 

Throstles have built their Nests, xichen pressed by Necessity, in 
a surprisingly short Space of Time. — I have known throstles, 
which had been robbed of their nests after one or two eggs 
had been laid, rebuild in a surprisingly short period ; and even 
upon the old foundation. I once took a nest, containing three 
eggs, but accidentally left behind the coarse external part of 
the nest ; circumstances led me by the place on the following 
morning, when I observed the throstle seated on the remnant 
of her nest, in which she had deposited her fourth egg, having, 
since the day before (that of the robbery), plastered it with 
the usual coating of rotten wood, moist earth, and, perhaps, a 
little cow-dung. — Henry Berry. Bootle, near Liverpool, Aug,

self amongst them. During two successive years the birds 
reared their broods, which were permitted to fly, and evinced, 
in all respects, the features of strongly marked hybrids. —

several nests from which I had driven the old birds, at Martin 
Mere, an extensive water and swamp in Lancashire. — Id, 

Fishes. — Facts on the Habits of Two Species of Stickleback, 
additional to the Facts in IIL 329. — Since the publication, 
in in. 329., of some observations of mine on the habits of 
the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus Lin.), I have had an 
opportunity, not only of confirming the remarks there re- 
corded, but of enquiring farther into the habits of this curious 
fish ; and have a few more facts to communicate. 

The fry of this fish were, this year, in abundance in the 
ponds and ditches in this neighbourhood [Clapton] as early 
as April ; but I was unable to procure any full-grown fish, 
earlier than the first week in June, except a few of the black 
species, with ten dorsal spines (Gasterosteus pungitius) [see 
III. 332.]. These, on being placed in a tub of water, did not 
evince their ordinary pugnacity of character. However, I 
confined about eight of the common species in the early part 
of June; and they, as usual, took possession of different sta- 
tions in the tub, and fought with their wonted fury. This 
disposition continued till the end of the month ; when, from 
some cause which baffled all my efforts to discover, they 
became sickly, the colours of the fighters faded, and they 
gradually died, notwithstanding I occasionally fed them, and 
gave them fresh water every week. I was more than ever 
surprised at their rapid change of colour : simply removing 
them into another vessel, during the process of changing the 
water, caused a marked difference in the beauty of their 
colours. That this figliting propensity is connected with 
sexual desire, appears obvious from their different treatment 
of the female fish. On introducing a female distended with 
spawn into the tub, they did not attack her as they would have 
attacked another ; but they rubbed up against her, and jmshed 
her about with their mouths : with a view, in all probability, 
to make her deposit her spawn; which, I suspect, they eat;

for they are very voracious, and will seize the minute fry oS. 
their own species with the fury of a pike* 

\_A'rgiihis folidceiis Jurine, fils. (VI. 94.)] They suffer, ill 
common with some other river fish, very much from a flat- 
shaped parasitical insect, which adheres closely to them; 
and, from the tenacity of its hold, frustrates every effort of 
the fish to remove it. This insect is, I believe, the A'rgulus 
foliaceus of Jurine, fils. Several times during the period of 
my keeping the fish, this summer, I detached as many as six 
of these troublesome insects from one fish. 

When the fishes are fighting, it is difficult to perceive them 
use their side spines (unless they are very closely observed) ; 
they strike so quickly, and often so fatally, with them. I had, 
this summer, one determined fellow, which, although con- 
stantly worsted, never failed to attack its neighbour whenever 
a fair opportunity offered. I turned it in where four others 
had their respective stations in the tub ; and it successively, 
but in vain, tried to take possession of their places : at last, it 
fixed itself in an unoccupied part of the tub, and effectually 
resisted every effort of the others to depose it. 

I have always failed in my attempts to keep these fish 
tlu'ough the winter ; therefore, I am uncertain how long they 
live : but I suspect that they do not live longer than two 
years. They disappeared here, from their usual haunts, by 
the end of June; since which, I have not seen any. — O.

The Pike has been seen to capture a live Rat *vohen this was 
swi?n7ning on the Surface of the Water. — An informant has 
witnessed, at Tottenham Mills, an incident to this amount : — 
One day, while parties concerned were unloading a large 
barge of corn, two or three persons, with their dogs, were 
looking out for the rats, which made their appearance every 
now and then ; and, by being driven overboard, afforded 
sport for the dogs. While these were in chase of one, and 
swimming and barking, and the men on shore shouting and 
urging them on, up rose a large jack, and, within a yard of 
the dogs, collared poor Nibble, and carried him down to the 
shades below, flapping its tail, in a very significant manner, 
in the faces of dogs and men ; to their no small astonish- 
ment, for they never .saw more of either the captured or 
captor. — John Reynolds. 23. Chadwell Street, Middleton

on the bank of the Derwent, saw a fine pike suddenly dart 
out of the river, and seize a swallow that was gliding along 
the surface of the water. (Morning Herald, July 4. 1824t.) 
Swallows nearly touch the water sometimes ; and pass slowly 
over the surface sometimes : and it is not difficult to suppose 
that the sun might be so low as to give the bird's shadow in 
advance of the bird itself, and thus give the pike an advantage.

Insects. — \_The external Covjiguration of some Species of 
Insects is ve?y extraordinary (II. 20., V. 318. 591.): Conjec- 
tures on some of the Purposes of this Configuration in some 
Species. • — The following remarks, by Mr. Guilding, he had 
written in relation to Mr. Kirby's figures and descriptions of 
the astonishing centrotuses in our II. 20 — 22.] : — 

Among my West Indian insects are several species which 
have these wonderful dorsal appendages : my collection con- 
tains several new genera, which I am about to publish ; 
and among them is a species without appendages, but having 
the promuscis [a form of mouth resembling a horn : see II. 
20, 21.] curved backwards over the head. This peculiarity 
of structure would enable the insect to obtain the nectareous 
juices of flowers which have a bended corolla ; and for this 
purpose it was doubtless given. Mr. Swainson has figured, 
in the first series of his Zoological Illustrations, a lovely little 
humming-bird, whose bill is, in a slight degree, similarly con- 
structed. The specimens I obtained from Demerara, and one 
of them was sent to my valued friend Mr. Kir by. The use of 
the processes, Mr. Kirby notices [in our II. 20.], are given for 
concealment and deception ; and they imitate, in a singular 
manner, the Clavariae and other jPungi which spring from the 
bodies of dead insects in damp places. 

One genus here is remarkable for the curious manner in 
which it protects its eggs from the rapacious ants ; which 
compel the larvae to offer them for food, on their extensile 
tubiform anus, their drops of saccharine excrement. The 
eggs have, under the microscope, the appearance of red 
cherries enclosed in one of those open white china basketwork 
fruit-dishes so common in the last century. — La?isdoivn 
Guilding. St. Vincent, May 1. 1830. 

[Mr. Westwood's very interesting figures and descriptions 
of insects remarkable in form, published in V. 318 — 327. 
591, 592., should be cited in connection with the above. 




602 Memhrdcis, Coccidce, 

To these we here add, from the Encyclopaedia of Garden^ 
ing^ now being published, 

Figures of Three Species of Memhrdcis. (^y^. 68.) — aa^ 
M. ensata ; b^ M. fuscata ; c, M. spinosa. The appendages, 
unusual to insects generally, which give 
these creatures so striking a form, are, 
according to Kirby and Spence [Introd., 
ed. 1827, iii. 537.)? processes of the pro- 
thorax. See the hUrod, of these authors, 
in ii. 225., iii. 537., for notices of various 
species of insects remarkable for their 
exterior form, armature, or vesture. In 
the Encyclopaedia of Gardening, § 307 l.j 
it is stated, from Mr. Svvainson, that he 
has " never met with the A'phides in 
South America ; but that their place in 
nature is there supplied by numerous species of Mem- 
bracis [see fig. 68.], Centrotus [see figures and descrip- 
tions of six species in II. 20 — 22.], &c., which are, in fact, 
the plant-lice of that continent." This last remark advises 
us, in a general way, of the habits of these creatures ; and 
this may be learned more particularly by a perusal of the 
communications on Z)elphax saccharivora JVesixvood, by our 
Grenada correspondent and Mr. Westwood, in VI. 407. 409., 
VII. 496., as the genera Z)elphax and Centrotus are allied ones ; 
and the genera Centrotus and Membracis are so closely allied, 
that some of the species of them have been interchanged. 
The Centrotus cornutus and genistae of Curtis's G?iide 
(1829), two British species, are the Membracis cornuta and 
genistae of Samouelle's Entomologisf s Compendium (1824). 
It must be interesting to learn, by a comparison of the Bri- 
tish species with the figures of American ones, in what degree 
their forms assimilate or differ. Centrotus genistae is, accord- 
ing to Mr. Curtis's Guide, figured in his British Entomology, 
t. 313. 

The CoccidcB of the West Indies, exclusive of insects there 
of the affinities just remarked on, are, it seems, agents there 
of the same effects in the economy of nature, as the aphides 
are in Europe. Mr. Guilding had remarked, in a note rela- 
tive to the mention, in II. 104., of aphides on the roots of 
plants of endive and lettuce in England, that " We have 
several of the Coccidae attached to the loose roots of plants, 
which soon die or droop from their attacks." 

Nearly all, it may be said quite all, collections of tropical 
plants cultivated in Europe are attended by a species of 
coccus, which English gardeners have named the scale, 



Walker's Nervous System, G03 

the scaly bug, and the turtle hisect ; names expressive of the 
insect's appearance and shape. It is, I have understood, 
of the species C. hesperidum ; and, perhaps, has been thought 
to have been imported with golden apples, that is, oranges, 
from the Hesperides : it affects, in Europe, the whole foliage 
of the citron tribe. Whencesoever it may have been derived, 
it demands, in plant stoves, the gardener's best attention to 
prevent its increase ; and thereby the injuries which it would 
effect, if allowed to live, upon the herbage of the plants. 
Another species of insect, called, by English gardeners, the 
mealy bug, is equally or even more troublesome upon tro- 
pical plants cultivated in Europe. This is the species which 
Dr. Gorman had met with in the Cambridge Botanic Gar- 
den, and had supposed to be identical with "the wild species 
of cochineal." (See II. 386.) Upon this subject, the follow- 
ing note had been made by Mr. Guilding : — "I doubt alto- 
gether whether the Coccus in the Cambridge garden is the 
Grana sylvestris of South America, both from the trees to 
which the insects were attached, and from the tenacity with 
which they adhered. Many species yield the dye; though 
they are too small and too little productive to be worthy pro- 
pagation for commercial purposes. Is it likely that any [of 
the] Cacti would answer in the open air of England ? " 

Some very minute Ants were exhibited, by Mr. Spence, at 
the Entomological Society's ninth sitting, on June 2. ; which, 
he said, had swarmed to so great a degree at Brighton, and 
some parts of London, that, in several instances which had 
come to his knowledge, the inhabitants had found no other 
alternative than entirely quitting their houses. [Ent. Mag.y 
ii. 312.) [We have quoted this for the sake of identifying 
them with the very minute species of ant which we had pre- 
viously mentioned, in p. 269., as occurring in a house at Ken- 
sington gravel-pits. For " 1833," in that mention, read 
" 1832." The house was that of Mr. Bayley, bookbinder and 
bookseller. — J. D.^ 



REVIEWS. 

Art. I. Catalogue of Works on Natural History y lately puhlishedj 
with some Notice of those considered the most interesting to British 
Naturalists. 

Walker^ Alexander, Author of " Physiognomy founded on 
Physiology: " The Nervous System, .Anatomical and Phy- 
siological ; in which the Inunctions of the various Parts of 



604} TVal/cei's Nervous System. 

the Brain are for the first Time assigned : and to which is 
prefixed some Account of the Author's earliest Discoveries ; 
of which the more recent Doctrine of Bell, Magendie, Sec, 
is shown to be at once a Plagiarism, an Inversion, and a 
* Bhmder associated with useless Experiments, which they 
have neither understood nor explained. Being the First 
Volume of an Original System of Physiology, adapted to 
the advanced State of Anatomy. 8vo, 704 pages. Lon- 
don, 1834. Smith, Elder, and Co., Cornhill. 
" With the view of adapting the work, as far as possible, 
to the general reader as well as to the professional student, 
the author, wherever he could, has avoided mere technicali- 
ties, and those statements which suppose things to be known 
which are unknown ; while he has sought to render minutiae 
impressive, and complexities simple, by explaining tlie im- 
portant and interesting functions in which they are associated. 
" Of all the objects of knowledge, the most important and 
interesting are certainly those here considered ; the functions 
of man, and especially those of his nervous or mental system. 
It is, indeed, only in relation to man and his mind that aught 
besides can possibly have [to him] even its subordinate in- 
terest : and, until this most important branch of physiology is 
thoroughly reformed, the very bases of moral and political 
science will be unfixed." 

The study of zoology leads to a knowledge of comparative 
anatomy, and comparative anatomy necessitates a knowledge 
of the anatomy and physiology of man. Hence, not any 
zoologist can be incurious on the subject embraced in the 
book whose title is given above. This subject is the high and 
difficult one of the agency of mind ; and more particularly of 
the mode and nature of the mind's relations, passive and 
active, to those corporeal organs which are the functional 
instruments of its operations. The views which the author 
has offered upon these themes are, it is advertised in the 
title, different from those which others have offered upon 
them. Which author has offered the most accurate ones, we 
are unable to say : we have only seen those in the work 
under notice. We shall content ourselves in apprising our 
readers of the existence of the work ; and, in remarking on 
it, that we deem it valuable, independently of the author's 
conclusions, though the accuracy and merit of these may be 
unequalled, in the store of information on anatomy, compara- 
tive anatomy, and physiology, which is supplied in the pre- 
mises from which the author has deduced his conclusions. 
The author has written vigorously and lucidly. He condemns 
utterly the performing of anatomical experiments upon living

animals ; and impugns all observations as fallacious acquired 
by means of them. The work is dedicated to Sir Anthony 
Carlisle. 

Macgillivray, TV., A.M. F.R.S.E., &c., Author of " A Nar- 
rative of the Travels and Researches of Alexander von 
Humboldt : " Lives of Eminent Zoologists, from Aristotle 
to Linnaeus ; with Introductory Remarks on the Study of 
Natural History, and Occasional Observations on the Pro- 
gress of Zoology. Small 8vo, 390 pages, with a Portrait 
of Linnaeus. Edinburgh and London, 1834-. 5s, 

Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, Gesner, Belon, Salviani, Ron- 
delet, Aldrovandi, Jonston, Goedart, Redi, Swammerdam, 
Ray, Reaumur, Linnaeus, and Linnaeus the Younger, are 
the naturalists memorialised. One hundred and ninety-three 
pages are occupied by the memoir of Linnaeus; and this 
memoir is one which, as we think, does justice to the charac- 
ter of this great man. Mr. Macgillivray seems quite free from 
the blind zeal of a partisan, and possessed of the candour and 
discrimination requisite in a judicious estimator. The work 
will be of real use to younger students of the science of natu- 
ral history, whatever may be their age, in enabling them to 
blend, with their progressive acquirements in the science, 
associations of the men, and of events in the lives of these 
men, who have contributed so much to render this science 
what it is.

Part vi. of this work is, we think, a favourable, although 
we know not that it is more than a fair, specimen of it. 
Treatises on the bats, the bears, and the beaver, and on the 
bearded reed-bird (titmouse), are the main of those included 
in it ; but those treatises are such as cannot fail to gratify 
lovers of nature, and make them think the inconsiderable 
price to be paid for them as nothing. We wish the obtain- 
ing of this part may lead to the purchase of the entire work. 
Although this work will be a long way from what we consider 
the words " cyclopaedia of natural history" to mean, it bids 



606 Cuvier^s Animal Kingdom^ 

fair to be the instrument of placing before the public such a 
store of information (some of it, too, addressed with force to 
the heart and understanding) on natural objects, as has not 
ever previously been generally accessible. 

Cuvier, Baron, and Latreille, P. A, : The Animal Kingdom 
arranged according to its Organisation, serving as a Found- 
ation for the Natural History of Animals, and an Intro- 
duction to Comparative Anatomy ; by Baron Cuvier. With 
Figures designed after Nature. The Crustacea, Arach- 
nides, and Insects, by M. Latreille. Translated from the 
latest French Edition; with additional Notes, and illus- 
trated by nearly 500 Plates on Steel. 8vo, in 36 Numbers, 
\s. each: to form Four Volumes. Number I., published on 
July 1. 1833. London, 1833. 

The above w^ords are a copy of those in our VI. 432. (in 
the Number for September, 1833), where we have farther 
pointed out the work to the notice of our readers. The fol- 
lowing communication remarks on the subsequent conducting 
of the undertaking : — 

I will thank you to insert, in an early Number of your 
Magazine of Natural Histori/^ the following extracts from the 
advertisements on the cover of the Translation of Baron Cu- 
vier's Regne Animal, published by G. Henderson ; and a 
statement of facts, which proves the falsehood of the extracts 
quoted : — 

From No. 1. — " The work will consist of 36 numbers ; 
each will be sold at one shilling: it will appear," &c. 

I have already received 37 numbers: for the first 27j I 
paid Is. each; and for the 10 subsequent numbers, 2^. each. 
" The plates, which constitute the most important source 
of expense, will amount to no fewer than 500," &c. 

The third volume is not yet completed: the numbers 
already published contain only 164 out of the 500 plates 
promised. 

" The advantages of the new work will at once be demon- 
strated, when it is stated that, for the sum of 365., the version 
of a celebrated standard work, richly illustrated, will be ob- 
tained ; which, in the original, with its plates, costs more 
than 36/." 

The work is to consist of four volumes ; it was to cost 
IZ. 165. : 336 plates, and more than one volume of letterpress 
still remain unpublished; and, for what I have already 
received, I have paid 21. 7s. 

From No. 4. — " The work will consist of 90 numbers ; 
each will be sold at si.vjpence" &c. 



arranged according to its Organisation, 607 

" The advantages of the new work will at once be demon- 
strated, when it is stated that, for a very trifling sum," &c. 

From No. 5. — " The work will consist of 36 numbers ; 
each will be sold at one shilling^^ &c. 
" The plates," &c. 

" The advantages of the new work will at once be demon- 
strated, when it is stated that, for a very trifling sum," &c. 
The advertisement on the cover continued unaltered 
from No. 5. to No. 21. inclusive. On the cover of Nos. 22. 
and 23., which were published in one, appeared the fol- 
lowing 

" Address, — The public will immediately see, that, accord- 
ing to the ordinary plan of issuing the plates which illustrate 
* Cuvier's Animal Kingdom,' the proprietor could never fulfil 
his engagement to supply the complete quantity. He begs, 
therefore, to apprise the public, that he will take the oppor- 
tunity, during the ensuing months, of preparing numbers 
which shall consist wholly of plates. By this method alone 
will the public be able to complete the first volume; and, for 
that purpose, the plates illustrating that volume will be issued 
in uninterrupted succession. The public is also informed, 
that the work will be further enriched with portraits of the 
various eminent naturalists who are distinguished respectively 
in the several departments of zoology." 

I have introduced the extract from the address on the 
cover of No. 4., as it contains the only hint that is given 
that the price of the work will exceed the stipulated sum: 
and this notice relates only to the sixpenny edition. The 
statement that the work would consist of 36 one shillinfi 
numbers, was repeated in No. 5. ; and continued to be 
printed till No. 21. inclusive. From the commencement 
of the work, no notice has appeared that the price of the 
numbers would be doubled ; or that the work could not be 
completed according to the first arrangement. 
These facts require no comment ; but, certainly, such 
conduct deserves exposure. — Johii Rcijnolds Howe, Wim- 
borne, Dorsetshire, Sejit, 17. 1834-. 

I should be glad if you could inform me how many num- 
bers will complete the edition of Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, 
now publishing by Henderson ? At the commencement of 
the work, it was distinctly stated that it would consist of 
36 numbers only, at \s. each; but it has already attained to 
34< numbers, and the price of 4l5., without being much more 
than half completed. — //. E, Strickland. Aug, 12. 1834.

No. ix. of TJie Lntomological Magazine is a rich one. TJiesc 
are the main of the subjects : — a CoUoquia Entomologica. 
Monographia Chalciditum, by Francis Walker ; twenty-nine 
pages. Notes on Deilephila euphorbia?. Description of some 
Coleopterous Larvae, by Mr. Waterhouse ; illustrated by 
figures. Attempted Division of British Insects into Natural 
Orders, by Edward Newman. This is the last of the longer 
communications, and put so by way of climax, one might 
imagine. In it, upwards of 150 orders are proposed, cha- 
racterised, named, and their affinities indicated. In the 
characters, we observe, that greater cognizance is taken of the 
conditions of the larva and pupa than we had previously seen 
done. Brief general views of the habits of the insects of each 
order are included in the characters of it. This production 
of Mr. Newman's must have a comprehensive effect upon 
entomology, and must be welcome to all engaged in the study. 

The first volume of the Transactions of the Entomological 
Society of London will be shortly published. 

Of Royle's Illustrations of the Botany and other Branches of 
the Natural History of the Himalayan Mount ains^ and of the 
Flora of Cashmere^ Part iv. is published. It includes gene- 
ralisations upon the plants of the orders Dipterocarpeae, 
Ternstrom/flV^^, Olacineae, Aurantiaceae, /fypericineae, Gut- 
tiferse, Hippocrate^Vt**^, Erythroxyleoe, Malpighi«V<^, ^cer- 
ineae, Hippocastaneae, and Sapindaceae ; and coloured figures 
of nineteen species of plants. In Ternstrom/aVr^, the author 
has presented nineteen pages of collected information on the 
question whether the teas of China are derived from plants of 
one or of more species, and upon the conditions which relate 
to the vegetation and the cultivation of these plants in China. 
From it all, the author has concluded that, " in the Hima- 
layas, where so great an analogy exists in latitude, elevation, 
soil, climate, and the course of the seasons, as well as con- 
siderable identity of vegetation, there cannot be a doubt of 
success in introducing the cultivation of tea, with the strongest 
probability of all its properties remaining unchanged." 

A work On The Mevolutions of the Globe, in a Series of 
Letters addressed to a Lady, to be included in one volume, 
post 8vo, is to be published by Ridgway, in November. The 
author states his object to be, " to give the public an idea of 
the curious results to which the study of the terrestrial globe 
has, in these latter times, led our most distinguished natu- 
ralists ; and to write so as to be understood by persons even 
the least conversant with the study of natural history."

Before entering farther into the enquiry? we briefly intro- 
duce a few additional illustrations of the positions attempted 
to be maintained in the preceding articles; especially as, 
owing to the circumstances of illness under which the sup- 
plemental paper [385 — 390.] was contributed to the Septem- 
ber Number of this work (No. 41.), some typographical 
errors * and some omissions are to be noted. 

With reference to the essay No. 2. (VII. 193 — 202.), 
the following facts are highly illustrative, and must not be 
neglected : — 

The German journals state, that, during the months of 
June, July, and August, 1834, immense multitudes of mice 
had appeared in the duchy of Baden ; committing dreadful 
ravages in the cornfields, and afterwards destroying the 
vines. In a small district, 20,000 of these destructive crea- 
tures were killed. In the adjoining country, a species of

black rat is said to have multiplied in equal proportion, * 
(See VII. 193—195.) 

The American journals also mention, that in the month of 
June, 1834, many parts of the United States were troubled with 
an incursion o{ locusts; which did much damage, and seemed 
to be called up from the earth, in incredible numbers, by the 
very means taken to destroy them. The statement is further 
increased by the assertion, that a similar inroad of locusts 
occurs every seventeen years, (VII. 196., and 308, 309.) 

In Hungary, during the same month, millions of beetles 
appeared ; devouring the vegetation wherever they came, and 
increasing in proportion to the means taken to smoke them 
to death. 

The Island of Grenada, and some other of the West India 
Islands, have also, during the spring of the present year, been 
incredibly ravaged by the cane Jly (a species of Cicada Lin,) 
[Delphax saccharivora Westwood, see VI. 407 — 413., VII. 
496.], which has destroyed two thirds of the crops. One 
gentleman stated recently, at a meeting of the Entomological 
Society, that this pest was immediately preceded by a violent 
hurricane. [See VII. 496.] 

M. Huber, in his Memoirs of the Natural History of Ge- 
neva, states that a huge column of the Vanessa cardui, in 
June, 1826, passed over the Canton de Vaud ; traversing the 
country, with great rapidity, from n. to s. Professor Bonelli 
of Turin, as well as M. Huber, observed, in March of the 
same year, a similar swarm of the same species, also directing 
their flight from n. to s., in Piedmont, in such immense num- 
bers, that, at night, the flowers were literally covered with 
them. They had been traced from Coni, Raconi, Susa, &c. 
A similar flight, at the end of the last century, is recorded 
by M. de Loche, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin, 
The fact is the more worthy of notice, because the caterpillars 
of this butterfly are not gregarious, but solitary from the 
moment they are hatched : and this instinct remains dormant 
while generation after generation passes away ; till it suddenly 
displays itself in full energy, when their numbers happen to 
be in excess." f Mr. Bennett, also, in his Journal of Natural 

* It would appear that the assertion of Arnobius (VII. 195.) is not with- 
out a comment in various allusions of the poets; for the ancients, who, 
like French cooks, dressed up their fables in such a way that they are 
scarcely to be recognised as originating in facts, gave to Apollo the name of 
Smintheus (Iliady i. 39.) ; which, according to the critics, was derived from 
the Phrygian word for 7nice or rats, the god having destroyed a great num- 
ber of those creatures which infested that country. 

f Mag. Nat. Hist., i. 387. ; also Lyell's Geology, ii. 1 14. [The late 
Rev. Lansdown Guilding had thus remarked, in a note, lying by us, on 
the mention in our 1. 387. : — "I have lately recorded, in the Zoologi- 



prevalent Disorders, SfC, mth Volcanic Emanations, 6 1 1 

History, relates a similar occurrence which took place at 
Colombo in Ceylon, when he was there ; and he says the 
butterflies were in " incredible numbers ; " and, " for the 
greater part of several successive days, passed down the 
road in a northerly direction." Mr. Lyell has also observed 
the periodical emigration of certain other ungregarious insects ; 
an instinct only developed in rare emergencies. (Geol,, ii. 115.) 

The country papers mention several instances of extra- 
ordinary visitations of very small black flies, so numerous as

ing the end of the month of September, 1834. They were 
noticed at Spalding (Lincolnshire Chronicle) on Sept. 28. ; 
and at Colchester and Chelmsford {Essex Standard) on Sept. 
29. and 30,, and Oct. 1. At the same time, a flight was also 
observed at Topsham, Devon, more than three quarters of a 
mile in length, travelling in the direction of the wind, which 
was blowing gently from the s.e. {Morning Herald.) A 
similar flight was noticed at Halifax and York, on Sept. 29. ; 
and, about the same time, at Cheltenham, and at Stroud. 

Mr. Foster, in his Calendar of Nature, appended to his 
work On the Atmosphere, mentions, in p. 427., that, on July 
17. 1822, he " noticed the immense quantity of butterjlies 
covering whole fields for miles together, in the neighbourhood 
of Boulogne;" and, on July 26. 1822, at Pont-y-Pani, he 
saw Jlies so numerous that, " in some places, the wall was 
quite black with their settling on it." 1822 was, as before 
named, especially a hot volcanic year. 

In farther illustration of No. 3. of these essays [289 — 308.] 
and its supplement (385, 390.), we may here, at once, refer to 
some additional particulars relating to the meteors of Nov. 13. 
1833; which have appeared in the July number of the Ame- 
rican Jour7ial (xxvi. 320.), in a very interesting paper on the 
subject, by Alexander C. Twining, civil engineer, and late 
tutor in Yale College, entitled, " Investigations respecting the 
Meteors of Nov. 30. 1833; Remarks upon Professor Olm- 
sted's theory respecting the cause." 

Mr. Twining states that the whole space yet traced, over 
which the meteors were seen, extends from the Lakes to the 
middle of the Gulf of Mexico; and from 61° w. to Central 
Mexico, in long. 100° ; that there was a twilight 07i the morm- 
ing of the 1 Sth, between Jive and six o'clock, issning from the 
whole soidh-eastern and southern quarter, while the western and 

cat Journal, a similar instance. A species of C61ia* was observed to pass,

ing Gulf of Prn-ia. — L. Guilding. St. Vincent, May 1. 1830."]

northern quarters were as dark as usual ; that four of the 
meteors formed their train into a cloud, and floated away to 
the eastward, as if borne bi/ winds; that the most striking phe- 
nomenon is, " the observed fixedness of the point of radiation in 
a particular part of the constellation Leo. He confesses, how- 
ever, that there are difficulties respecting this ; and I confess 
that I am not quite satisfied with the above conclusion. 

He states another fact, viz., that the " radiant " (the point 
whence the meteors seemed to radiate) " had a location ma- 
nifestly independent of meridians and 'verticals, and riot confned 
to geodesic lines.^* He remarks, also, that there was " not 
only a progressive increase of northern declination in southern 
latitudes, but the differences of declination, compared with 
the differences of latitude, were strikingly correspondent,^* 
amounting to about 1° 54' of north declination for 1° of 
north latitude : and to account for this, when there was 7io 
parallax in right ascension, as the effect of parallax, he con- 
siders untenable. He adds, that there was neither parallax nor 
parallactic motion ; that the radiant point was " everywhere 
stationary, or nearly so : " but the evidence certainly goes to 
establish the fact, that the radiant was not stationary till about 
3 or 4 A.M., it having a motion from w. to E. (or a little south 
of east); and that this motion, at first rapid, gradually de- 
creased. He says, also, there was, with the exception of 
particular accidental coincidetices<i no tendency to follow the 
magnetic dip. 

The conclusions come to by Mr. Twining are similar to 
those of Professor Olmsted. [385 — 390.] Other particulars 
are given, which are very interesting. One meteor is described 
as " if a column of glowing melted metal had been poured 
down from the spot whence the meteor issued ; another had 
a brilliancy " above the brightness of the sun ; " and several 
traversed arcs of 20° and 30°, vanishing in clouds as big as, 
and even five times as big as, the moon. The result as to the 
height of these meteors is, that " they entered the atmosphere 
with a velocity not less, but perhaps greater, than fourteen miles 
in a second; that they became luminous above eighty [miles'] 
from the earth; and. became extinct nearly thirty miles from it" 
Mr. Twining is obliged, however, to confess, from an examin- 
ation of the facts, " that the atmosphere itself must have its 
limit much higher tha7i is generally supposed; " and suggests, 
whether it cannot be ascertained by the means of the upper 
extremity of " shooting stars," which certainly seem to bear a 
close affinity to the meteors of Nov. 13., what is the height of 
the atmosphere. (This tallies with my remark in p. 387.) 

The above gives, pretty accurately, the principal features 
of Mr. Twining's " investigation ; " although compelled, by

want of space, to be compressed and abbreviated. The great 
question of the origin of these meteors is considered, I must 
say, fairly; but the solution is totally at variance with a vol- 
canic hypothesis. The first argument is, that, if the meteors 
were " atmospheric^ electrical^ magnetic^ or even unknown and 
merely i7naginahle" they ought to have conformed, in arrange- 
ment or motion, to geodesic lines. But, with all deference to 
the reasonings of Mr. Twining and Professor Olmsted (who 
has considered gravity " an adequate cause " of the motions, 
in which I agree with him ; though Mr. Twining disputes it), 
it does not at all follow that meteors occasioned by volcanic 
emanation should pursue any " geodesic " line. If their com- 
posing matter had been pumped upwards into great heights, 
in or above what is called " our atmosphere," they might, 
after having been, either by attraction or electrical forces, 
formed into a mass, be whirled along by the action of wind ; 
or might partake of the earth's proper motion, through 
restraint of gravity, and appear to have an eastward motion ; 
till, becoming stationary, they should be discharged as de- 
scribed, the stationary position being determined by the excess 
of gravity. I cannot but infer that this position of the radiant 
is a powerful argument m favour of a terrestrial origin. It 
may also be added, that a want of coincidence with the mag- 
netic dip and variation is not a reason why these meteors had 
nothing in common with the " north lights " or the auroral 
arch; for, though the aurora has frequently (p. 291.) corre- 
sponded in these respects, it has not always corresponded ; 
and the absence of agitation on the part of the needle, during 
the display (as noticed by Mr. Twining in his " investigation ; " 
Silliman's Journ., July, p. 34?7.)j is not a necessary absence ; 
for the needle is not always affected by the aurora, though 
there are cases where such has been the effect.* Mr. Twining 
contradicts himself when he says, " the reverse of such a 
coincidence do we find ; " for he has allowed some " parti- 
cular accidental coincidences," which, perchance, were not 
accidental. Moreover, it has been before stated, in the Ajne- 
rican Journal (xxv. 356. : see M, N. H., vii. 291.), that the 
radiant agreed exactly with the point of magnetic direction ; 
and the whole evidence goes to prove that the cessation of 
progressive motion corresponds with this point. The change 
of declination of the meteors (Mr. Twining allows) may turn 
the argument against him : it certainly does so, and by no 
means encourages the supposition that " any terrestrial origin 
seems to be cutoff." [Sil. J. p. 34-7.) The next argument is,

614 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

that the meteors having an " independence of the earth's rota- 
tion," and the " stationary condition " not being " an instanta- 
neous cause," but rather " an ultimate state of motions gra- 
dually becoming quiescent, the conclusion seems inevitable, that 
our planet owed the brilliant decorations of its atmosphere, 
on the morning of Nov. 13., to the presence of foreign and 
celestial visitants." The independence of the earth's rotation, 
and yet the coincidence of the motion of the radiant with that 
of the earth, in direction from w. to e., may, however, toge- 
ther w^ith " the stationary condition " of the meteoric cloud, 
be reconciled upon the hypothesis before advanced [385 — 
390.] of a volcanic origin ; which influence, we have already 
proved almost indubitably, has been known to affect the atmo- 
sphere as it was affected after the display in question ; and to 
coincide with the occurrence of the aurora, and the exhibition 
of meteors scarcely less brilliant or less striking than those of 
Nov. 13. 

With Mr. Twining's next argument, that these meteors 
had no secondary dependence upon our planet (farther than 
as alluded to above, and in his denial of any analogy with 
meteorites *), I have no controversy ; but, with the last of his 
arguments, respecting an " orbit of revolution round the 
sun" (for the reasons already stated, in my remarks [385 — 
390.] on Professor Olmsted's paper, and on Mr. Twining's), I 
can hold no sympathy. They follow the preceding arguments 
naturally and properly ; but, doubting the premises, I cannot 
approve the deductions. With the truly philosophical and 
religious tone of Mr. Twining's " final observations," I do, 
however, most warmly sympathise, as they express the feelings 
which subjects of this kind must awaken in the bosom of 
every reflecting person : nor is the just and beautiful argu- 
ment for the ^' protectiiig" care of the Almighty lessened, in 
my opinion, by the result of our speculations ; whether the 
meteors were "foreign and celestial," or " of the earth, earthy." 
In either case, mercy is mingled with power : and, perhaps, 
after all, the argument would be strengthened by the reference 
to the " volcano " rather than to the " comet." For, if the 
latter be restrained by the invisible hand that launched it into 
space, so, also, is the Jfttte*- made the safety-valve of a planet 
w^hich, we must conclude from observation, has all the won- 
derful energies of combustion and explosion that might have 

* In contradiction of the asserted distinctive character of these meteors, 
it is expressly stated by Mr. Jenkins, Principe 1 of Middletown Academy 
(Silliman's Journal, xxvi. 397.), that " the meteoric shower of Nov. 13. last 
presented appearances similar to those which have been often described ; 
except that no particular point of radiation was observed." Middletown is

been supposed incompatible with a residence for man. It is, 
after all, a matter of little "practical importance what is the 
secondary origin of a meteor ; but thus much do speculation 
and theorising avail for good, that no man, with a correct view 
of his own insignificance, and with a simple-minded aim, can 
explore any of the bountiful fields of science which are spread 
out so magnificently above him and around him, and not find 
himself a better man, even if he have to acknowledge himself 
a *uoorse philosopher than he imagined. 

To return, however, to facts in illustration of that with 
which I set out: the earthquake at Chichester, on August 27. 
1834, was coincident with the most tremendous earthquake 
of Vesuvius on record, and was followed by a brilliant aurora 
soon after. The shock of Sept. 21., at the same place, was 
followed by the aurora on Sept. 30., and by meteors on 
Sept. 29., and on Oct. 1. and 3., as seen from Hensbury, 
near Bristol; Bologna being shaken by an earthquake on 
Oct. 4. 

I may observe, also, that, on Dec. 20. 1799, there fell, in 
the province of Benares, many meteoritic stones, coming from 
the westward ; the relations of which are given in Lord Va- 
lentia's Travels (i. 468. appendix). These stones were at- 
tended with great light ; and, in other respects, the meteor 
was of similar character to those of Nov. 12. 1799, in Cu- 
mana {Mag, Nat, Hist,y vii. 291.), with which it may have 
been connected. The meteors seen by Humboldt were cal- 
culated to have fallen into the sea between America and 
Africa : which was probably an optical deception ; for it is 
altogether impossible to ascertain that. The latitudes of 
Cumana and Benares, and the eastward motion of the meteor 
in India, might rather lead us to infer, that there was as much 
connection between it and those of Cumana, as between the 
meteors seen at Mocha, on Nov. 14., and in England, on 
Nov. 19. 1832; the space travelled by the latter, and the 
time of the journey, being taken into account. 

In addition to former examples, it may be added, that, in 
the year 1832, the volcanoes of the Pacific Ocean were in 
unusual action. 

On Oct. 31., Etna was violently affected; while, during 
March (8. to 14.), violent earthquakes occurred in Calabria, 
Modena, and Reggio ; and, on May 26., in the Apennines, 
Gulf of Genoa, &c. {Journal de la Bclgique, Juin 8 — 11. 1832.) 
So that there were ample materials, on my supposition, to 
produce the meteors in question. The heat was so great in 
some parts of Europe, during the autumn of 1832, that the 
ground spontaneously took fire. Such was the case in Swit-

616 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena^ 

zerland ; as at Geneva and Lausanne, where fire appeared. 
The same phenomenon occurred at Maglanz in Savoy, 
where the trees were consumed below the ground. {A, R.) A 
recent number of the Journal qfCourland and Livonia (Sept., 
1834-) gives an account of a fire in a great moor, caused by 
the long drought. Thousands of people were employed in 
digging ditches to arrest its progress ; but the moor frequently 
began to burn behind them, the fire rising from the earth 
having probably spread at a lower depth than the bottom of 
the ditches.* Similar events have occurred in Russia, Ca- 
rinthia, &c. 

As general additional illustrations of foregoing statements, 
we might refer to Mrs. Graham's [Calcott's] letter to Mr. 
Warburton ; in which she says, that, during the evening of 
Nov. 19. 1822, when the earthquakes commenced in Chile, 
and previously to them, the aurora aiistralis, and lightning o\qy 
the Andes, had been seen; that, on Nov. 21., there was a 
thick fog while the earth was being shaken ; and, on the 26th, 
she says, " we had a violent nordierly wind, with rain, which 
ivas considered very unusual at the seasoji" {Geol. Trans.^ i. 
415. 2d series.) 

The last remark leads naturally to the main subject of the 
present essay, namely, 

Violent Winds and Hurricanes; which, as we have seen, 
have attended the incursions of ravaging insects in the West 
Indies (p. eiO.), the meteors in America [296, 297.]» the 
aurora (298.), and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions gene- 
rally. But it is impossible to enter on this topic without con- 
necting it with another, the temporary changes of climate^ the 
rains, inundations, and tempests, &c., of the last few years. 

During the last year, " tremendous gales " and hurricanes 
were most frequent ; and the almost constant position of the 
wind in the w. and s.w., during the autumn and winter of 
1833, produced distress and destruction amongst mercantile 
and nautical interests scarcely ever paralleled. Ships were 
detained more than three months in the Channel, whilst ves- 
sels from the westward and southward made incredibly short 
passages.

returned to Penzance for the thirtieth time, having been unable

Volcanos of Neuwied^ p. 254.). The fire in the country of the Juhones is 
just as likely to have arisen from the extreme heat of the weather setting 
fire to the soil in the first instance, as from an accidental ignition of gas ; 
though in both cases, probably, an evolution of inflammable gas occurred.

Three solutions have been given of the cause of these 
westerly winds, which, in the south of England have, assumed 
a somewhat constant character. Some say we are receding 
from the sun ; others, that the clearing of the wilds of Canada 
has so changed the cUmate, that the n.w. winds will prevail 
over to England, causing no winter in the southern counties, 
and producing cold at New Orleans ; causing a British westerly 
trade wind, and driving the real trades to the south of the 
Mexican Gulf; others, again, attempt (as the Qiiarterly Re- 
view, xviii. 447.) to account for them by the melting of the 
ice in the Atlantic. Let us examine these theories in order. 
1. As for the recession of the earth from the sun, of which 
certain German philosophers have spoken, we may safely 
refer our readers to the calculations of astronomers themselves, 
to show how unfounded are any fears connected with a known, 
but in this respect unimportant, fact in science.* 2. As to 
the clearing of the woods in Canada producing a change in 
the climate of England, observation tends to prove that such 
a supposition is perfectly erroneous. 

Dr. Kelly has shown, in the Transactions of the Literary 
and Historical Society of Quebec (iii. part i. 46.), from a com- 
parison of recent observations, and an examination of ancient 
documents, that the climate of Canada has not altered during 
the last two hundred years, and that, consequently, no change 
can have been wrought in Europe, within the last few years, 
on that account. The winds which prevail in that colony 
are, he says, chiefly from the w. and s.w. ; and Mr. C. R. 
Redfield {S\\\\m?k\\^s Amer. Jour., xxv. 114.) considers these 
winds as part of the circuit of the trades to the n.e. from the 
Mexican mountains, drifting through the valley of the St. 
Lawrence f, and, when not high, causing the heat at Montreal 
sometimes to equal 93°. That the climate of Europe, within 
the course of centuries, has changed, there is no doubt ; the 
vineyard countries of England, France if, and Germany have 
most assuredly decreased in temperature ; and, to account for 
a recent partial amelioration, certain writers have attributed 
it to the clearing of woods nearly 4000 miles from the British

shores ; not considering that, if such could be the cause of 
warmth in modern Europe, the clearing of the great forests 
of ancient Europe must have heightened the temperature 
also.* It has been proved that the climates of Palestine 
and Rome, and the adjacent countries, have not changed dur- 
ing the last 3000 years ; and, tlierefore, as the west and the 
east have maintained their equilibrium, the recent changes of 
climate in Europe must be attributed to another cause. That 
cause I consider to be simply the occasional increase or revival 
of the volcanic action, which hundreds of extinct craters in 
France and Germany prove to have been infinitely more 
active than at present. Be it as it may, Canada can have 
nothing to do with our prevalent winds, nor with alternations 
of climate in England. 

3. The third class of writers attribute the cause to the 
melting of ice in the Atlantic.f As this hypothesis has been 
received almost generally, and been made the agent of results 
which I think not referable to it, we must examine it some- 
what in detail. 

I have made allusion to this as the cause of cold in certain 
years (p. 300.) ; but it is impossible to allow some of the ar- 
guments drawn from occurrences of the kind, as stated by a 
popular writer in the Qiiarterly Review, to hold good, without 
refusing the assent of our se7ises to a contrary conclusion as 
far as affects the year 1833. 

" During the winter of 1348, the whole coast of Iceland 
was frozen, so that a horseman might have ridden from cape 
to cape round the island. Such a circumstance had never 
occurred before since the country was discovered ; and it seems 
probable that in this winter the accumulation of ice began, 
which has blocked up the coast of East Greenland. [Quarterly 
Review, vii. 52.) . . . Having resisted the summer, it took root, 
as it were, along the coast, and has continued to increase,

* A Mr. Williams published, in 1806, a work on the climate of Great 
Britain, in which he attributed our wet summers to the practice of making 
fences of hawthorn (Cratae^gus Oxyacantha, i.), instead of holly (/Mex 
-(^quifolium L.). He states that, during the 60 or 70 years preceding the 
date of his book, the quantity of hawthorn hedges had produced a material 
effect on the atmosphere. 

f Amongst these is M. Arago, who published this theory in the An- 
niiaire for 1834, and is, it is said, engaged in writing a work on " climate.'* 

X To show the inconsistencies of reviews, we take the following contra- 
diction of the statement in the text : — "It is a common, but we believe 
an erroneous opinion^ that the temperature of our climate has regularly been 
diminishingy and that it is owing to the ice havitig permanently fixed itself to 
the shores of East Greenland^ which, in consequence, from being once a 
flourishing colony of Denmark, is now become uninhabitable and unap- 
proachable. We doubt both the fact and the inference ! " {Qluarterly Review,

ourselves in sovie degree experience" (p. 53.) " There is good 
reason for supposing, that even our own climate has under- 
gone some changes since his time" (Horrebow, about 1735). 
" Iceland will probably become colder, tinless some earth- 
quake should break up the belt of ice "which forms a rampart roimd 
East Greenland:' (p. 71.) 

That, about the time here spoken of, the phenomenon al- 
luded to took place, there is, I believe, no question. Arago 
says, Greenland was free from ice in the tenth century; 
flourished as a colony in ]120; and that in 1408 Bishop 
Andrews found the coast so blocked up that he could not 
land. (Annuaire, 1834.) 

" Towering icebergs formed at the same time (134-7-8) 
on the coast of East Greenland, in consequence of the general 
concussion of the earth's organism ; and no mortal, from 
that time forward, has ever seen that shore or its inhabitants." 
(Hecker, Black Death, p. 75.) 

There is an indirect evidence upon the subject, which de- 
serves notice. It appears that formejly the Priory of Cha- 
monix, in the valley of that name, was in the jurisdiction of 
Courmayeur. The Priory was founded in 1099. Chamonix 
is on the north side of Mont Blanc, in Savoy ; Courmayeur 
on the south side, in Piedmont. The records of the Priory 
attest, that there was formerly a direct path between those 
places through the valley now filled with the ice and snow of 
the glaciers, which form the Mer de Glace, and that it took 
eight hours to traverse. [Ebel, ii. 262.) The horizontal 
distance between Chamonix and Courmayeur U about two 
leagues, the breadth of the base of Mont Blanc. The present 
route extends full 18 leagues. In 1787, M. Bourrit and his 
son made a hazardous journey over the glacier, by way of the 
Col de Geant, occupying 17i hours. Saussure, in 1788, was 
two days going from Chamonix to the Col de Geant, 5}^ hours 
from Courmayeur. But the dangers of this pass are now so 
great, that ordy one Englishman, and that in 1 786, has been 
known to attempt it. The height of 10,500 ft. on Mont 
Blanc corresponds in the isothermal scale with the level of 
the sea under 83° of n. latitude, and above that height there 
is nothing but ice and snow.* Now, it certainly appears from 
this, that, previously to 1348, the Alps were as free from ice as 
the coast of Greenland ; and there are other facts which point 
out that there is a coincidence between the highlands of 

xvi. 170.) In a subsequent volume the same review goes into a scries of 
proofs to establish both fact and inference ! (see xviii. 205.)

ing of the note in that page, which the present allusion will correct.

Europe and the polar basin.* The coincidence may, how- 
ever, and probably does, only belong to the accumulation of 
ice and snow. Observation almost establishes this fact : for 
the diminution of ice in the Greenland seas, however pro- 
duced, by causing an influx of ice into lower latitudes, might 
temporarily chill, to a limited extent, the European, as it cer- 
tainly does the American, continent. If the " earthquake^* 
alluded to by the reviewer in the Qiiartcrly Review (vii. 71.) 
should break up the belt of ice round Greenland, or if 
volcanic heat should melt away the foundations of the rampart, 
the lower latitudes would become cooler imthin the sphere 
of the ice's influence. The popular writer to whom I before 
alluded actually asserts that this was the case all over Eu- 
rope and America in the year 1818, in consequence of the 
breaking up of the ice previous to 1817.f He states, that 
for two years America, and the whole of Europe as far as 
Malta, were chilled, and that " in Nei<D Orleans the ice was 
2 in. thick, the ground covered with snow, and the thermo- 
meter down to 27°; that Etna was unusually loaded with 
snow, and the whole Continent was visited with unusual stoi^ms 
of wind and torrents of rain f* and adds, that, " as these phe- 
nomena have occurred with wind from the westward^ they are 
everywhere ascribed to the approach and melting of ice in 
the Atlantic." {Quart. Rev., xviii. 147.) It is a certain fact that 
the year 1816 was a miserably cold and stormy year, and that 
Etna was not alone in the enjoyment of an unusual mantle ; 
for Ritter, in his " Beschreihung des Mont Blajic** (p. 103.), 
says, that, on Mont St. Bernard, '^ Im Jahre 1816 verging 
Jceine Woche ohne Schnee im ganzen Jahre " (not a single week 
passed without snow, throughout the year). (See M, N. i/., 
vii. 440., note %.) But will this warrant the conclusion of the 
reviewer. " that the floatin^y and thawing of such vast bodies of 
ice in alow latitude have been the causes of those extraordinary 
gales of wind from the west and south-west, accompanied with 
sleet and snow ; and produced those storms and inundations 
which have visited not only these islands, but a great part of

the polar ice. On the effects of the increase of the glaciers, see Quarterly

ice continue to be carried away from the polar seas, and 
melted in the Atlantic, we have nothing to expect but a raw, 
moist, chilly atmosphere, with westerly winds both summer and 
winter'^''' {Qiiarterly Review, xviii. 447.) 

If these assertions be correct, the test may be safely applied 
to the years 1832, 1833, ISS^, during which years " such 
fields and islands of ice " have been " carried away from the 
polar seas, and melted in the Atlantic," as I shall proceed to 
show : yet what becomes of the parallel afforded by these 
years to 1816, 1817, 1818, when our atmosphere has not 
been " raw and chilly?" To make the parallel as strong as 
possible, let us take two or three preliminary facts. In 1818, 
there was ice at New Orleans 2 in. thick." {Quart, Review.) 
So, in November, 1833, very early frosts set in, and the 
crops were ruined. The ice in the ponds was Ijin. thick. 
Full 1 000 acres of land were in consequence abandoned ; 
and, instead of 120,000 hogsheads of sugar, only 50,000 
were expected to be produced. {New Orleans Paper.) 

It appears, also, that, in 1831, the ice was not removed 
from the shores of Newfoundland late in the month of June 
(Redfield, in Silliman*s Amer. Journ., xxv. 134.); and that it 
blocked up the Strait of Belle Isle in the month of August. 
(Baddeley, in the Qiiehec Transactions, iii. 144.) In 1833, 
the inhabitants of Newfoundland enjoyed no summer. In 
May, the thermometer was 21° below the freezing point ; on 
May 11., it stood at 19°. In June, it was seven times at or 
below 32°. In July, it was only eight times above 50°, three 
times below 40°, only ten days above 70°, and it was three 
days below temperate. In August, there were only eight 
nights above 50°; three were below 40°; and only three days 
above 70°. * 

Accounts, also, up to Nov. 1 5. 1833, mention, that great cold 
had been felt in Canada, in the autumn and summer, which 
had prevented the crops from ripening ; and that early frosts 
had set in, doing great damage. Capt. Back's despatches 
state, that the winter of 1833-4, in the northern parts of 
America, was more tremendously cold than ever before known. 

On Mont St. Bernard, unusual accumulations of snow took 
place in Dec. 1833, and avalanches were frequent, causing 
great damage, f On the Pyrenees, however, 7io snow had 
fallen through the winter of 1833, up to Jan. 12. 1834; but 
there were there dreadful rains, attended with thunder and 
lightning, which, on that day, struck the tower of the church

at Orthez. [French Papers.) On March 25. 1834, snow fell 
on the mountains of Abruzzo, near Rome : there had been 
no snow there at that period since 250 years. * In the Ar- 
chives of the Academy of Incoronati, it is said that snow fell, 
and remained a whole day on the ground and houses, on 
March 25. 1595. The winter of 1833 was particularly mild 
at Rome. These cases are mentioned in order to show that, 
as in 1816 — 1818, there have been instances of unnsual 
cold in these last three years. f We will now try how far 
there has been a disengagement of ice, and a melting thereof 
in the Atlantic. On reference to the Quarterly Review 
(xviii. 447.), the state of the ice in 1817 and 1818 will be 
found. The following examples not only parallel, but con- 
tinue, the statements there made.f 

On Dec. 1. 1832, the Sir E. Codrington and the Jonah 
were lost in the ice at the entrance to the St. Lawrence. On 
Feb. 26. 1833, the Emulous packet met with field ice off 
Nova Scotia, in long. 30° w. ; and, in lat. 43° N., long. 49° w., 
she fell in with packed ice : on March 4., she passed three ice- 
bergs in ninety-five miles' run. It is most untisual to meet 
with ice in this part of the Atlantic during winter. The 
Harvest Home and Mary Ritchie struck on ice, on May 9., 
in lat. 46°, long 45° w. The Martha was sunk by ice, on 
May 18., 290 miles from Newfoundland, after being eight 
days beset. The Lima was beset, on May 11., 400 miles 
off, in lat. N. 46° 20% long. w. 45° 50'. The Waterloo was 
lost, on June 14., off the Banks; and the Mary White, on 
June 21. On June 29., the British Tar and Alloa left the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence : on July 3., they found Belle Isle 
blocked up with ice; they put back : on July 6., they passed 
through seventy miles of ice, some of the pieces a mile in 
length. They found nine brigs, two ships, and a bark stand- 
ing off and on at the eastern edge of the ice, waiting for a 
passage ; and, as far as the eye could reach, to 48° long, w., 
icebergs were numerous and immensely large. The General 
Wolf was lost, on July 6., in 46° n. 48° w. ; and the Francis 
and Mary, off the Banks, on July 11. On March 7., the 
Maria Elizabeth left Cork for Newfoundland : she fell in with

f Surely there must be a mistake in one of them ; the reviewer says, 
the Funchal left St. John's, Newfoundland, Jan. 17. 1818, and, about 
fifteen miles " westward''^ of that port, fell in with ice ; again, she fell in 
with ice in 42° lat., 250 miles " more westerly^"* This is as bad as the 
offence which Mr. Waddington committed, when he made the Nile run the

ice, and was dragged * by it to the coast of Greenland (in 
attempting a passage through it), where she was detained 
three months and a lialf. She reached St. John's, Sept. 15. 
In the spring of 1833, the Banks of Newfoundland were 
more crowded with ice than had been ever known ; and I 
have memoranda of more than thirty other vessels lost off the 
coast of America, or in crossing the Atlantic, by falling in 
with ice. We have the authority of Captain Ross, that the 
ice broke up in Lancaster Sound on August 14. On Oc- 
tober 3., the ship Lancaster was fallen in with abandoned 
among ice, in 45° n. 45° w. The Helen Mearns, from Que- 
bec to Belfast, passed large icebergs, on October 30., in lat. 
55° N. 38° w. ; and, in 55° n. 11° w., quantities of wreck, 
with gales from w. N. w. On Feb. 13. 1834, a vessel reached 
the West Indies, which had been detained many weeks off 
Newfoundland. The President frigate, which took out Sir 
Colin Campbell to Halifax, and arrived there in the begin- 
ning of July, fell in with icebergs 100 ft. high, in lat. 44° — 46° 
N., and long. 44° — 64° w. The thermometer fell from 60° 
to 45°. The whole passage was attended with cold^ rain, and 
westeriy "winds, 

Newfoundland, also, during the spring and summer of the 
present year, has been suffering most severely from the im- 
mense accumulation of ice and snow. 

The southern hemisphere has, also, during the same 
period, been encumbered with ice to a low latitude. The 
following particulars are from the log of the Arethusa, Capt. 
Boultonf, which sailed from Van Diemen's Land round 
Cape Horn, in Dec. 1832: — From Jan. 4. 1833, till 
Jan. 20., she was beset with ice. She fell in with it in lat. 
54° 48' s., long. 148° 57' w. On the latter day, the ice was 
almost impassable in lat. 56° 59' s., long. 93°46'w. This 
was just 5° N. of the spot where ice was seen in 1832. She 
left the ice, Jan. 24., in lat. 56° 51' s., long 78° 6' w. The 
Tula, in 1832, saw ice 7° nearer the south pole than the 
above. In 45° and 44° s., long, 42° and 44° w. the Arethusa

Mr. Scoresby [Arctic Regiofis) is the principal authority 
respecting the season when the " barrier of ice " first broke 
away, and afforded materials for the encumbering of the 
Atlantic with the masses which, we see from the above ac- 
count, have, since 1816, been met with by vessels sailing to 
the westward. He particularises the following seasons : — 
1803, open, weather tempestuous, wind n. e. ; 1804, close; 
1805, as usual; 1806 and 1807, close, wind N. e.; 1808, 
nearly open; 1809, close; 1810, as 1804; 1811, uncom- 
monly close; 1812, 77iore singularly close, most formidable 
season [the year of Bonaparte's retreat from Moscow]; 
1813, open, uncommonly tempestuous, wind E. ; 1814, open, 
wind s. and w. ; 1815, open; \S\6, partially open; 1817, 
especially open ; the coast east of Greenland seen for the first 
time since 1607; 1818, less open, but more so than usual. 
(Scoresby, i. 276., and § vii. 284.) " In these two seasons of 
1817 and 1818, the sea was more open than on any former 
occasion remembered by the oldest fishermen ; an extent of 
sea amounting to about 2000 square leagues of surface, in- 
cluded between the parallels of 74° and 80° n., being quite 
void of ice, which is usually covered by it." (Scoresby, Arctic 
Regions, i. 284. See also Quarterly Review, viii. 203.) The 
map of the ice appended to Mr. Scoresby's narrative shows 
distinctly the extent of the change thus produced, and is very 
instructive. 

Since the years above named, the Atlantic has never been 
entirely free from ice ; but there have been periods, when 
the cold has been particularly severe, and the ice in both 
hemispheres has been especially disturbed. * From 1826 to 
1828, ice was found floating off the Cape of Good Hope as 
low as 39° to 36° s. lat. ; and, on April 20. 1828, the Eliza, 
from Antwerp to Batavia, met with five icebergs in 37° 31' s., 
and 18° 17^e., against which the sea broke violently. (Hors- 
burg, P. T. 1828.) From 1827 to 1829, the coasts of La- 
brador and Greenland were more encumbered with ice and 
snow than before known. f In April, 1825, also, immense 
icebergs were met w^ith, three days' sail from Newfoundland. 

The cause of the disruption of the ice from the polar seas 
is, by the Quarterly Reviewer, said to be " its own weight ; ". 
and he states, as a singular coincidence, that the needle became

stationary at the time he alludes to, 1817. (xviii. 203.) Now, 
there are reasons, why this is a most iinsatislactory explanation. 
That the magnetic needle might be contemporaneously affected, 
and that, at the period when its variation altered, a great 
change might take place in the earth's organism, is more 
than conjectural; and that fact might have pointed out a 
cause for the " breaking loose " of the ice less unphilosophical 
than has been assigned. The years 1816, 1817, and 1818 
were celebrated for earthquakes ; and Mr. Scoresby has 
actually mentioned that, on April 29. 1818, Bird (or Egg) 
Island, a dependence of Jan Mayen's Island, was smoking ; 
and it is probable that there were eruptions before ; for the 
space whence the ice was removed is volcanic. * In accord- 
ance with the state of things a few years later, we find that, in 
1828, the glacier of Skideraa Jokul, in Iceland, was in erup- 
tion {Gruithuisen^ p. 42.) ; and Capt. Ross states that the 
winter of 1829 was the mildest on record; that the season of 
1831-2 was tremendously cold, and that of 1832-3 very mild. 
Capt. Parry states, also, that 1818 and 1825 were unusually 
mild. (Third Voyage, p. 151.) Dr. Besserf has furnished 
us with some particulars respecting the seasons at Kreminiec 
in Volhynia (in lat. 50'' 5' n., long. 23° 21' e. from Paris), 
four miles from the Austrian and Russian frontiers of Brody, 
from 1815 to 1830, by which it appears that 1818 was an 
early year, and 1829 a most extraordinary season for mild- 
ness; and that, from 1820 to 1830, no frost occurred there, 
only snow, in winter; and that the summers were free from 
rain, producing famine of usual food. I can only refer, as a 
confirmation of my views, to the statements respecting the 
numerous earthquakes of 1829, given by me in VI. 301., 
which correspond exactly with the state of the ice at that 
period in both hemispheres. f It is easy to show, by the 
records of the years 1816, 1817, 1818, that the earth was 
generally heated at that time by volcanic agency ; and the

626 Supposed Con7iection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

state of the earth in 1827, 1829*, 1833, 1834., tallies also 
with the recent descent of the ice from the poles. To what, 
then, can we attribute the " breaking up " and " floating 
away" of the ice since 1816, but to the one universal agent, 
the influence of an increased terrestrial heat? The year 
1833 parallels, as we have seen, in all respects, that of 1818; 
and both periods are parallels of that of 1348, when a greater 
disruption of ice took place, and, in consequence, the coast, 
now partially free, was encumbered. The cause which has 
operated recently, doubtless operated in 1 348 ; and the 
blocking up was, there is every reason to believe, occasioned 
by the same agency as the hrealnng up. It was accident, 
perhaps, which first grounded the foundation ice of the " ram- 
part;" and the same accident may occur again. There is no 
reason to believe that either cold or mildness are of any fixed 
duration in the polar seas; and there is every reason to 
believe that the changes of climate there depend, in great 
measure, on the developement or inactivity of subaqueous and 
subterranean heat. 

I will allow that, in 1348, the blocking up of lower lati- 
tudes might have chilled Europe to an immense extent; but 
there is no ground for supposing that the more recent alter- 
ations in the ice in the Greenland seas, or its frequent melt- 
ing in the Atlantic, can produce such an influence on the 
climate of England as has been asserted. If the position of 
the Quarterly Reviewer be a just one, it could have stood the 
test I have put it to in the foregoing remarks; and, tl^refore, 
since the year 1833 has been distinguished by an intensity 
and duration of southerly and westerly winds, not paralleled 
for twenty-four years : and since those gales have been accom- 
panied with a warmth not paralleled for twice that length 
of time ; since, also, the present year has been hotter than 
perhaps ever known, and the seasons at least a month earlier 
than remembered; and since, during both years, ice lias been 
floating into low latitudes, we ought not to attribute the gales 
in question to the ice, which ought to produce " a raw, moist, 
chilly atmosphere," but to a cause which, despite the ice, has 
set the air in extraordinary motion, and heated the earth 
throughout. What that cause is, I have already surmised. 

* In 1829, Kirauea, in the South Sea, was in eruption. {Stewart.) In 
1831, there was an earthquake in Owhyhee : the sea is said to have risen 
in a pyramid, four or five miles from shore, " higher than the bread-fruit 
trees, which are 60ft. or 70 ft. high. (Goodrich, in Silliman's Amer. Journ.y 
XXV. 199.) In 1832, Jan. 12., Mouna Kea, in Oahu, erupted with violent 
earthquakes; and on June 20., Mouna Loa broke out for three weeks : 
the crater was filled up 50 ft. higher than the black ledge in Lord Byron's 
account. (/^.)

That the American continent, to a certain extent, may be 
affected by the ice, when this has received a lodgement on her 
shores, no one can dispute ; and that a momentary passing 
chill may be produced, in the direction of the prevalent wind, 
by ice crossing that line, even in England, I would not deny ; 
but this is the extent of the influence to which I would Hmit it. 
The inundations, hurricanes, and tempests of 1 8 1 6, and even the 
accumulation of snow partially, in lil probability, owed their 
origin to electrical agents, set in motion by the cause which 
filled the Atlantic with icebergs. Westerly and southerly 
gales, it seems, have blown on the other side of the floating 
ice ; and, therefore, unless the American continent has been 
much colder than the ice, these winds cannot be caused by it. 
But it so happens, that the heat and drought experienced in 
Europe have been felt also in America, even in Canada, 
although the coasts of Canada and Newfoundland have been 
dreadfully chilled by a transported winter. It is said, that 
" in Virginia scarcely a night" occurred, in 1816, without 
frost, even in summer *;~in New Orleans, the ice was 2 in. 
thick, &c. &c. [Quarietiy Review, xviii. 447.) Now, can any 
man believe that frost in New Orleans is caused by ice melting 
in the latitude of 40° ?f We have seen that the south of 

• In Virginia, the south-west wind prevails in the summer. {Jefferson.) 
f The latitude of New Orleans is 30° n., and its longitude is 90° 10' w., 
and it is situated in the Gulf of Mexico, from which a warm current sets 
northwards, between the Bahamas and Florida, at the rate of four miles 
per hour, " which is not reduced to two miles till the stream has proceeded 
a distance of 1800 miles in the direction of Newfoundland, when it meets 
with a current setting to the southward from Baffin's Bay, and is thereby 
deflected to the east." (Ly ell's Geol.y i. 258.) " It retains, in the pa- 
rallel of 38°, nearly 1000 miles from the above straits, a temperature of 10® 
Fahr. warmer than the air." (/<-/., p. 108.) Now, it is not pretended that 
the ice has come lower than 40°; and, even calculating the distance be- 
tween 40° and 30°, in the same meridian, at about half distance between 
England and the spot where it was seen on October 30. 1833, still the 
difference of climate and the breadth of difference in longitude must upset 
the calculation ; for we are told by a recent writer, that, even at Christmas, 
the heat at New Orleans is so great, that oranges, peas, and red pepper 
grow there in the open air. (Mrs. Trollope's Domestic Maimers of the 
Americans^ i. 9.) " The extreme limits of the icebergs in the northern 
hemisphere appears to be the Azores," or 42'^^f. (Lyell, Geol./i. lll.)yV 
Moreover, Mr. Lyell says, on undoubted authority, that the Gulf stream 
" maintains an open sea free from ice in the meridian of East Greenland 
and Spitzbergcn." (i. 108.) The lowest latitude registered by the Quar- 
terly Reviewer (xviii. 446.) is 41° 51', in long. 50° 53' w., which is more 
than 1800 miles from the meridian of New Orleans, and consc{|uently the 
iceberg in question was more than 2000 miles from New Orleans; the 
Gulf stream, the atmosphere above, and the Carib Sea intervening. The 
spot is scarcely more than 120 miles from that where the Emulous met 
with packed ice on Feb. 2G. 1833; so that this memorandum will serve 
for both cases. Major Rennel estimates the distance between the Gulf of

628 Supposed Connection of Meteoric Phenomena, 

Europe was chilled, in 1832, by some extraordinary cause 
[M. N. H., vi. 292.) : and could that cause which produced ice 
at Smyrna, so that skating was practised *, have been the 
melting of a few icebergs off the Azores ? Was the cold, which 
was felt after the meteors of Nov. 1833, produced by the ice? 
At that time, the coast of America was beset by ice ; yet we 
have the evidence of an eyewitness that America was unusually 
warm. (VII. 388.) f Was, also, the cold which followed the 
meteors in Germany (VII. 299.) occasioned by ice ? Yet surely 
so, if the positions in the Qiiarterly Reviexi\ respecting 1816, 
hold good. How is it to be accounted for on that theory, that, 
while great accumulations of snow took place on the Alps 
during the last winter, the Pyrenees, so much nearer the melt- 
ing ice of the Atlantic, remained free ? And how do the state- 
ments respecting the ice in May and June, 1834, agree with 
the weather in England during those months ? :j: Less rain 
and warmer "-dceather than since 1829 marked them; and not 
" a raw, moist, chilly atmosphere^'' As to the frost at New 
Orleans, it may be observed that, in New Grenada, from 
Dec. II. 1808, to the end of Jan. 1809, the cold was greater 

Mexico and the Azores at 3000 miles ; and considers the stream to run 
that distance in about eleven or twelve weeks. Now, it is for these 
reasons that I conclude, that tiiough the ice, to a certain extent, brought 
cold, and tempered the climate it passed through, the effects did not 
extend to New Orleans ; but that the cold there, as in Mexico, New Gre- 
nada, &c., at certain seasons, had a different origin, though contem- 
poraneous with effects actually produced by ice elsewhere. Ice at New 
Orleans is far more likely to be produced by a n. w. wind than a n. e. In 
the West Indies, I believe, ice is never naturally formed,- but occasionally, 
when the winter in America is very severe, and the wind from the n. w., 
Nevis, Antigua, St. Kitt's, &c., experience sufficient cold to cause the 
closing of shutters and doors : but this is all the effect produced.

and that the spring was earlier by a week. After September, westerly/ 
winds ivcre prevalent; i. e. winds that blew tOy not from ^ the ice then melt- 
ing off the coast of America. Such was the case, also, in the year 1831, 
when the United States were affected with unusual cold during the pre-

than ever known, and ims attended hy frosts. The sky was 
always hazy, calm, and dry ; the wind always from the south. 
This extended over the first twelve degrees of south latitude. 
But the climate of New Grenada is subject to severe frosts at 
night, even during the season of most scorching heat. The 
inhabitants of the country desolated by the earthquakes at 
Pasto, &c., in January, ISSl-, suffered from this most dread- 
fully. 

Towards the end of August, 1804", the maize in New Mexico 
was so completely destroyed by intense frosts, that famine, 
and its attendant pestilence, carried off no less than 300,000 
persons. Now, 1804^ was a close season, when little ice was 
melted in the Atlantic; and the same may be said of 1809. 

Were these frosts caused by ice in the Atlantic ? Yet, why 
not ? Again, are the horrid frosts in Persia and China, and 
in Africa (12° n.), caused by this melted polar ice? As has 
been well observed by M. Parrot, the cooling of the sea, by 
the melting of the ice, would be like cooling Geneva Lake 
with a cubic fathom of water of the temperature of melting 
ice : and to cool Europe this way would be still more pre- 
posterous.* M. Parrot is contending against Fourrier's theory 
of a central fire; and says, in continuation, that, if such a 
fire exists, it would be proved by the increased temperature 
of the sea at great depths. He proves that the temperature 
at sea decreases with the depth ; and alludes to Mr. Scoresby's 
experiments in the deep sea between Greenland and Spitz- 
bergen, where the heat increased even amidst ice ; and justly 
observes, that this heat was owing to the volcanic mass below.f 

M. Parrot rejects in toto the idea of a central heat; and 
considers that all the phenomena connected with terrestrial 
lieat arise from volcanic action, which has existed from the 
earliest times ; and still operates, though with much less 
intensity than at ancient eras. In this case I am completely 
borne out in my speculations by M. Parrot. 

Notwithstanding, in the above remarks, I am far from 
wishing to deny any indubitable influence that the ice may 
have in producing sudden paroxysms of cold in the direction 
of the wind blowing across it. The chill, in the spring of 
1833 and 1834, and, perhaps, an occasional coldness since, 
were, as I believe, occasioned by the wind bringing to our 
shores a stratum of " r^w moist air :" but I dispute that the

ice was the cause of the wznd^s direction ; the point I am 
endeavouring to explain. Navigators all state, that, in 
approaching the ice, the temperature falls ; and that variable 
and gusty ^whirlwinds attend it : they give no idea of a constant 
breeze from the west. So far, then, I allow, and no farther, 
the melting of ice in the Atlantic to be a means of cooling 
our atmosphere : and this melting of the ice is, it is almost 
certain, the effect of terrestrial heat ; so that even our " raw, 
moist, chilly " weather is attributable to the same cause as the 
dry hot atmosphere which has so recently prevailed. Para- 
doxically, this is to maintain that heat may produce cold ; 
but cold can never produce heat, I will, in my next paper, 
consider the question more fully.

Art. II. Observations on some of the Diseases in Poultry. By 
J. M. CoBY, Esq., Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 
London, of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, of 
the Medical and Philosophical Society of London, &c. 

As the diseases of the feathered tribe have not hitherto 
attracted much scientific attention in this country, it may not 
be uninteresting to the readers of the Magazi7ie of Natural 
History to be presented with a few facts and investigations 
deduced from the study of comparative morbid anatomy. 
The pathology of birds had been slightly entered upon by 
Mr. Youatt, the highly talented professor of veterinary medi- 
cine at the London University ; and it is to be regretted that 
his researches, which appear to have been confined to more 
valuable animals, have not been extended in this department. 
The naturalist may possibly be able to refer to a nosological 
system in some of the numerous works on zoology, British or 
foreign; but I am not aware of the existence of any such 
system. Girard's Anatomic des Animaiix Domestiqucs, 2 vols. 
Paris, 1820, which is one of the latest foreign works on the 
structure of domestic animals, does not, I believe, enter upon 
the subject of pathology. 

L Cerebral Apoplexy or Stroke, — The animal, when attacked 
with this disease, suddenly falls, appears senseless, and is 
found with the head bent under the neck or thorax. Every 
time an attempt is made to place it in a sitting or standing 
position, the head is constantly forced downwards below the 
breast, the cranium resting on the ground. There is no incli- 
nation to take food ; and, when it is artificially introduced 
into the pharynx, it passes onward to the crop. In some 
instances, death rapidly supervenes; in others, some days 



the Diseases in Foultiy, 631 

elapse, when convulsions in the voluntary muscles appear, 
and continue till life is exhausted. 

This disease is, I believe, always considered to be fatal; 
but its nature and remote cause are, I apprehend, little known. 
I believe, in most, if not all, cases, it is occasioned by some 
vegetable poison, received into the stomach, which has the 
effect of exciting an engorgement of the vessels of the brain, 
and a consequent rupture of one of the veins or sinuses of 
that organ. 

On the 31st of August, a fine young hen dropped from her 
roost almost immediately after she had placed herself upon it. 
The apoplectic symptoms, above described, were immediately 
observed ; and, at the end of a week, convulsions of the 
extremities, and of one or both of the larynges (or vocal 
organs), took place; and, on. the eighth day, she died. She 
was artificially fed and kept v/arm during the whole illness, 
and deglutition was completely effected ; but the crop had 
not discharged any of its contents, which had been thus 
accumulated within it. 

On examining the head, I found a rupture of the longi- 
tudinal vein or sinus near that part where in the human 
subject the torcular Herophili is situated ; and a considerable 
quantity of coagulated blood was lying in contact with the 
cerebellum and medulla oblongata, and forced into the mas- 
toid cells. The gizzard was distended with Irish ivy, which 
had been picked from a wall covered with it, and bounding 
the poultry yard. On enquir}^, I find that ivy is well known 
to be poisonous to poultry. Its secondary operation on the 
vascular system of the brain or cerebellum has probably 
never been suspected. 

2. Emphysema, — Chickens, when about two weeks or 
three weeks old, are subject to an emphysematous swelling, 
a collection of air, under the integuments about the neck, 
generally preceded by a slight morbid sound in the larynx; 
and accompanied with vertigo, closing of the eyelids, droop- 
ing or convulsive motion of the Vv'ings, and coldness of the 
whole body, which ends in death. This is a different disease 
from the roiqj, which is designated by a mucous or muco- 
purulent discharge from the eyelids, mouth, and nasal passages. 

Dissection presents no m.orbid appearance in the lungs, or 
injury in the ribs ; and the pharynx, oesophagus, gizzard, and 
the rest of the alimentary canal, are free from disease ; except 
the ileum, the mucous coat of which I have, in some in- 
stances, found in a state of softening (or what the French call 
rajnollissemcfU\ readily admitting of abrasion, occasionally 
attended with perforations ; and, in one case, with black 

s s 4 



632 Diseases in Poultry. 

marks on the peritoneal coat, opposite the disease in the 
internal surface. These black marks, of which the annexed 
is a representation, arise from a species of 
disorganisation, which is, I beUeve, pecuHar to ^ f" f f f' f 
serous membranes, as I have never observed z / / / / z 
them in other structures; and, on that part 
of the intestinal tube being immersed in water a few hours, 
they disappear, and leave corresponding semiperforations. I 
have remarked the same appearance in the human intestines, 
accompanied with a softening and abrasion of the mucous 
tunic, and a general disease of a specific character affecting 
the whole serous covering of the abdominal viscera. The 
other morbid phenomena consist of a softening, erosion, and 
partial destruction of the spinal marrow, immediately adjoin- 
ing the medulla oblongata, accompanied with a considerable 
effusion of bloody serum, and preternatural vascularity of the 
adjacent parts. 

The extravasation of air is probably produced by the rup- 
ture of one of the axillary or thoracic air cells into which the 
animal has the power of inflating air from the lungs by means 
of numerous large tubes resembling the respiratory organs of 
insects. I am disposed to believe that there exists in these 
cases a direct communication between the cellular membrane 
infiltrated with air and the lungs ; because, whenever I have 
punctured the integuments, and produced perfect collapse, 
the swelling and crackling have been speedily and repeatedly 
restored. I have not been able to trace the exact source 
from which the air proceeds, as the cells, even in large birds, 
are of delicate structure, and, in some, extend from the 
axilla under the skin along the neck ; and, in young poultry, 
they are still more delicate. I hope to be able to ascertain 
this point, and to direct my enquiries more particularly to the 
state of the trachea and inferior larynx. 

The morbid condition of the spinal medulla and the adjoin- 
ing medullary structure is sufficient to account for the para- 
lytic and convulsive affections of the upper extremities ; but 
whether this state may be primary or secondary, appears to 
me at present uncertain. As I am engaged in the in- 
vestigation of some diseases of the nervous system, which has 
led me to take advantage of comparative physiology and 
pathology, I decline at present entering any farther into this 
important subject.

In the West Indies, these creatures are fatal ; and a single 
acarus will sometimes kill a full-grown fowl. An account of

Art. III. Information on the Habits of a Species of Caprimulgus 
[or of some closely allied Genus) xvhich inhabits the Neighbourhood 
of Lima. By Mr. Andrew Mathews, A.L.S., Travelling Col- 
lector of Natural Productions in South America. 

The specimen sent is one of the male of a species which is 
common in the vicinity of Lima. It visits this neighbourhood 
in about the end of October or beginning of November. The 
female lays her egg (I have not seen more than one) upon 
the bare ground, without the least sign or preparation of a 
nest, and at a distance from any vegetation. One which I 
had watched daily, this last summer, until the young bird had 
become hatched from it, was laid on a " huaca " (a large heap 
of stones) planted around the base with grape vines ; so that, 
had the bird preferred privacy, she might have placed her 
eg^r where it would liave been more secret. The egg is of 
about the size of a blackbird's egg, of a dirty white or stone 
colour, motded with olive and brownish green of different 
shades. The young is, at first, covered with a greyish down : 
as its feathers appear, it assumes the colour and markings of 
the parent. The female parent, during the period of incuba- 
tion, is remarkably fearless, and will even suffer the hand to 
be brought within 2 ft. of her before she will quit her charge. 
Her colour is so much that of the ground and stones, that 
she, when sitting, is not readily observed. When she does 
quit her charge, it is only for the distance of a few yards;

and if she observes you touch or examine the egg^ becomes 
restless, keeping her wings in motion, and uttering a low 
twitter of uneasiness. The male sits upon the ground during 
the day, beneath the branches of the vines, and usually com- 
mences his evening flight about five or six o'clock. Whilst 
the bird has been on the wing, I have frequently observed a 
sudden twist or bend of the head ; but, from the quickness of 
its flight, and from its usually flying high, I cannot confirm 
or contradict what is advanced in 111. 32, 33. [By Mr. 
Dillon, on the use of the pectinated claw of the nightjar. 
See also III. 188. 296. 449; IV. 275. 425.] That the 
South American species have the serrated claw may be seen 
by the specimen I send. In its stomach I found, on dis- 
section, a quantity of mosquitoes and some coleopterous 
insects [this is the instance referred to in p. 560.], which were 
taken, probably, while it was on the wing. I do not think 
the bill suited to taking beetles upon the ground. These 
birds leave the neighbourhood of Lima in April or May. 
The specimen I send was shot at Lurin, about twenty miles 
from Lima, in the end of July: the species is called " dur- 
midero" by the natives. As I am not well supplied with 
ornithological books, I shall feel obliged for information 
whether it be a described species, and, if it be, what it is 
called. I wish the specimen to be presented to the Linnaean 
Society for their collection. 
Lima, August 22. 1832. 



We are sorry that we have so long withheld Mr. Mathews's 
communication, and present to him our apology for doing 
so. Our motive for the delay has been the wish to get the 
species identified with some one already described, or get it 
clearly distinguished as an undescribed one. We have not, 
even now, succeeded in attaining either object. One orni- 
thologist, to whom we had submitted the specimen and account 
of it, has replied, — "I have searched the different ornitho- 
logical works to which I have access, but without finding Mr. 
Mathews's goatsucker. It is probably undescribed." An- 
other naturalist, versed in ornithology, to whom we had sent 
the specimen and account, has remarked in reply : — "I 
have here no means of ascertaining its systematic name ; but 
can nevertheless assure you that it is a species very well 
known, so that a technical description of it would be unneces- 
sary. It is one of those curious species with pectinated claws, 
but without any vibrissas on the rictus, the absence of which 
has occasioned many naturalists to doubt that the former 



foimd 7tear Lima. QS5 

structure is ever used to clear from the mouth the hooked 
claws of coleoptera, &c. ; but, I think, without sufficient reason, 
for the beetles might hitch to the rictus as easily as to the 
vibrissse, and more so. Mr. Mathews's account of its habits 
is interesting, and in these it resembles very closely the com- 
mon species of this country ; but one curious circumstance is 
mentioned, that of its laying but one egg, which, should it 
prove to be invariably the case, would be a remarkable 
anomaly in the genus. I wish that its note had been de- 
scribed." 

To complete our account of the specimen of Caprimulgus 
sent by Mr. Mathews, we add a technical description of it, 
which the ornithologist first alluded to above has supplied. 

Length, from the point of the beak to the end of the tail, 
8 J in.; from the point of the beak to the gape (rictus), seven 
eighths of an inch ; width of mouth across, 1 in. The whole 
of the upper surface of the back, a speckled ash grey, marked 
on the top of the head with dashes of black and streaks of 
the same colour on the back. The general colour of the 
upper surface of the wings rather lighter than that of the 
back, beautifully mottled, and various feathers distinctly 
marked with black at their bases, and yellow at their points. 
The primaries black, dusky towards the tips, with a minute 
edging of white. The bird was a male ; and the first four 
primaries are marked v/ith an oval spot of white which per- 
vades both webs. The wing, from the point of the shoulder 
to the end of the second primary, which is the longest, mea- 
sures 6|in. The two centre tail feathers are of the same 
speckled ash-grey colour as the back, but are barred ob- 
liquely with black ; and> when the tail was closed, these two 
feathers hid all the others : the outer, four on each side, are 
mottled over their proximal half [the half nearer the body] 
with black and white ; the distal half [the half farther from 
the body], black, with the sexual white spot in the centre of 
the black, extending over both webs. The chin freckled 
with reddish brown and black. The throat white ; this 
colour extending on both sides to the space behind the open- 
ing of the ear. The whole of the under surface of the body 
and the wings pale rufous brown, transversely barred with 
dusky black. The under surface of the tail primaries alter- 
nately barred with black and white. The bird, in small ness 
of size, as well as in the want of vibrissas on each side of the 
beak, resembles the swallows ; but in every other respect is 
a perfect Caprimulgus, and has the middle toes nearly as 
long again as the outer ones, with the claw broad and strongly 
pectinated.

To keep our clew of the notices in this Magazine on cer- 
tain Caprimulgidag, mostly the Caprimulgus europae\is, wound 
up, we now add V. 726.; VII. 156. 3t7. and note *, 511. 
559, 560. 633., to the references given in V. 674. 

In IV. 424., V. 241., VII. 511. 559., objections are ex- 
pressed to the application of the names goatsucker, Capri- 
mulgus, and Nyctichelidon, to the species of birds to which 
they are applied, as not any species of them either sucks a 
goat ; milks a goat, which deed the word Caprimulgus im- 
putes ; or is a night-swallow, strictly speaking, which the 
word Nyctichelidon, taken literally, implies it to be. O. has 
remarked, in VII. 511., that a species which visits Lower 
Canada is called by the inhabitants " the mosquito hawk ; " 
and he has added, that this is " a more appropriate name, as 
relates to the habits of the bird, than goatsucker." Mr. 
Mathews has informed us above, that the species which is the 
subject of his notice had fed on mosquitoes and coleopterous 
insects. In relation to the name of the species which visits 
Britain, a correspondent has recently asked as follows : — 
"Would not the nameNyctivociferator europaeVs be preferable 
to Caprimulgus europge^us Z., or to Nyctichelidon europae^us 
Rennie? All the kinds of the genus 'Caprimulgus' are 
addicted to screeching : some in the night. — W. H. Y. Sept. 

10. 1834." As we suspect that our correspondent's proposed 
generic name of seven syllables, the first two Greek, the rest 
Latin, will scarcely be well received, we may state that he had 
previously proposed, in a communication, dated July 5., " Vo- 
ciferator europae\is," as the name of the nightjar which visits 
Britain. " Vociferator," as a generic name, is free from the 
literary objections to which " Nyctivociferator " is subject. 
All these words about names, which we have for once indulsfed 
in, may serve to mstance reasons, however humble ones, for 
the opinion on generic names which Dr. Lindley has expressed, 
and other naturalists have concurred in. (See VI. 232.) His 
opinion is this: — " So impossible is it to construct generic 
names that will express the peculiarities of the species they 
represent, that I quite agree with those who think a good 
U7imeaning name by far the best that can be contrived." 

Previous contributions by Mr. Mathews will be found in 

11. 67. and IIL 431. In VL 314—319. are figures and de- 
scriptions of some marine animals which Mr. Mathews had 
discovered, and a notice of the fact of his having collected 
many species of plants in South America, some of them not 
previously discovered ones, and of Dr. Hooker's having named 
a South American plant, Mathews/a foliosa, in honour of him. 
Besides Mr. Mathews's attention to, and acquisition of, objects 



J\l7gratio?i of the Mackerel. 637 

of these classes, he collects, he has informed us, " nests, eggs, 
and skins of every kind :" and it is a pleasant duty to remark, 
that the state of the specimens sent to us fully testifies his 
skill ; the colour and plumage being well preserved, and the 
skin entire, soft, and flexible. Mr. Mathews, at the date of 
his communication, stated, that any orders sent to him, might 
be directed for him, to the care of John MacLean, Esq., 
Lima ; " as my letters will be taken care of, whatever part of 
Peru I should happen to be in.'' We received the skin of 
the Caprimulgus through Mr. Hunneman, 9. Queen Street, 
Soho, who, we believe, is in professional communication with 
Mr. Mathews. 



Art. IV. Reasons in support of an Opinion advanced, that the 
Mackerel is not a Migratory Species of Fish. By O. 

The frequent appearance of the mackerel (iScomber ^S'com- 
ber L.) in the shops, at periods of the year when it is not 
expected, has long induced me to doubt the fact of its being, as 
Pennant calls it, " a summer fish of passage." By reference 
to my journal, I find this fish has been common in the shops 
of the London fishmongers, the last winter, during the months 
of December (183S), January (1834.), and February (1834). 
Now, if the species be migratory, as is generally supposed, 
these individuals could not, surely, have come from distant 
seas to our coasts at an unlooked-for period of the year, 
because the season may have been mild, to go back again on 
the return of severe weather ; for then, it is to be observed, 
they again disappear. The conjecture I have to offer is, that 
the mackerel do not, as is the conceived opinion, migrate 
into distant seas when the spawning season is over ; but that 
they then retire into the vast depths of the ocean, near their 
spawning quarters, beyond the reach of the lines and nets of 
the fishermen. I have, for many years, observed, during the 
winter season, after mild or turbulent weather, that mackerel 
are invariably to be seen in the shops ; and the reason for 
this appears to me to be, that the instinct implanted in them 
to visit the shallower water for the important business of 
spawning, is either matured by an unusually mild and un- 
seasonable state of the weather, or that the violence of the 
winds has driven them from their deep retreats in the ocean ; 
showing, in either case, that their migrations are not into 
remote seas. Reasoning from analogy, in natural history, is 
said [V. 499.] not always to be a safe guide ; but the habits 
of the char (iSalmo alpinus L.) bear no small analogy to the 



638 Zoological Illustrations : — 

habits I impute to the mackerel ; though I am aware I am 
comparing a freshwater fish to a saltwater one. When the 
char spawn, they are seen in the shallow parts of the rocky 
lakes (in which only they are found), and some of the streams 
that run into them ; they are then taken in abundance : but 
so soon as the spawning is over, they retire into the deepest 
parts of the lake, and are but rarely caught. Such, I venture 
to suppose, may be the habits of the mackerel. This opinion 
is offered with deference ; and it would be a gratification to 
have it confirmed by some who may have more opportunities 
for pursuing the enquiry than I have. 
Clapton^ Sept, 1834. 

[Our correspondent's opinion is quite in accordance with 
that of a naturalist distinguished in his knowledge of fishes ; 
who, farther, sees in the law of nature which impels fishes to 
visit the shores periodically, a beneficent provision for the 
 welfare of man, who, without the action of this law, would be 
deprived of many of those most valuable to him as food. 

Our correspondent, the Rev. W. B. Clarke, has mentioned 
unusual dates of the appearance of mackerel, and other species 
of fishes, in VI. 291, 292., VII. 197., in his collection of facts 
relative to his arguments in proof of his proposition of the con- 
nection of meteoric phenomena with volcanic emanations.]

glass, irregularly expanded at the brim." The British spe- 
cimen here delineated has something of the latter form, and 
is about an inch in height with a breadth of nearly three 
quarters: it is affixed by a hollow, thick, and very short 
stalk, which expands into a shallow cup, with unequal, waved,

and sinuous margins. It is pure white, calcareous and beau- 
tifully reticulated ; the meshes about a line in length, oval, 
subequal, regular, and divided by celluliferous spaces rather 
wider than their own shortest diameter; the cells immersed, 
quincuncial, leaning, with the apertures looking upwards, a 
little prominent, round with a small tootii on the distal edge: 
they open only on the superior or inner aspect; for the under 
surface of the polypidom is imperforate and almost smooth. 
Of the polype architects very litde is known ; but they are 
said to be " very vivacious," and so industrious in their voca- 
tion, that their building rises with a rapidity which has ex- 
torted an expression of wonder from several observers. 

To Mr. Bean of Scarborough 1 again tender my thanks, 
for the liberality and kindness which induced him to entrust 
his valuable specimen of this our prettiest zoophyte to my 
examination. It may be regarded as a new addition to our 
native list; for although, in the History of Zoophytes by Ellis 
and Solander, it is said that " this elegant little coral is 
found now and then on our coast," and we find it introduced 
into the works of Turton and Stewart, yet the evidence 
appeared so slight and unsatisfactory that the Rev. Dr. 
Fleming has rejected it; influenced, perhaps, by the fact that 
the latter naturalists, at least, had confounded it with the 
Retepora reticulata, figured in Borlase's Histoiy of CorrmalL 
Mr. I3ean's detection of it in very deep water at Scarborough, 
where it is very rare, renders its claim to denizenship indis- 
putable ; and I heartily congratulate him on his good fortune; 
for it is just one of those little discoveries over which the 
simple naturalist rejoices with feelings which amply repay 
him for the toil of much patient research.

640 Salt of the Motmtahi of Gem, 

Art. VI. Some Account of the Salt of the Mountain of Gern^ at 
Cardona, in Catalonia^ Spain; tvith some Facts indicative of the 
little Esteem entertained by Spaniards for Naturalists. By W. 
Perceval Hunter, Esq. 

As no description of that curious production of nature the 
mountain of Gern salt, at Cardona, in Catalonia, has ever 
appeared in any English work, to the best of my knowledge; 
and as, too, the place will not, probably, be visited again for 
years, owing to the bloody civil war raging in its environs ; 
the following notes, taken down on the spot, however im- 
perfect and foulty, may not, perhaps, be altogether devoid of 
interest. 

This hill, or mountain as it is generally called, is situated 
near the foot of the Pyrenees, about sixty miles from Barce- 
lona; and is, according to the measurement of Bowles (Infro^ 
duccion a la Historia Natural de Espana, p. 249.), from 400 ft. 
to 500 ft. in height, and one Spanish league, or nearly four 
English miles, in circumference. The depth is unknow^n, as 
well as the nature of the rocks on which it rests, but the form- 
ation of the surrounding country is red sandstone and red 
marl. The whole hill is of the purest solid salt, with the 
exception of a few mounds of earth scattered about the base 
and sides, on which I collected from twenty to thirty species 
of plants ; but, from my utter ignorance of botany, I could 
not write down their names, and as I was unable to procure 
any thing to dry them with, in the wretched dirty little town 
of Cardona, they withered up, and I threw them away as use- 
less, the next day, on my road to Cervera. Tlie prevailing 
colour of the salt, from the foot to the summit of the hill, is 
of an icy-coloured white ; in some places, however, is seen a 
variety of snowy white, as well as patches of red, green, black, 
and blue, which, decked out, as they appear to be, in all the 
colours of the rainbow, fluted at the sides, and ending in peaks, 
present, when the sun shines, one of the most beautiful sights 
imaginable. 

All these varieties, when broken with a hammer, and ground 
down into powder, become of the same colour, and have the 
same delicious flavour as the white ; next to which the red or 
rose-coloured is the most common : it is cut up into slabs and 
used as a most efficacious remedy against rheumatism, cramps, 
and other pains in the body and limbs. When I visited these 
saltworks last November, the workmen were busily employed 
in cutting these slabs (ladrillos, as they call them ; I ft. long, 
4 in. wide, and | in. thick), of which 60,000 had already been 
sent to Seville as a remedy against the cholera morbus. They 



at Curdona, in Catalo7im, 641 

are well soaked in brandy, the administrador of the Salinas 
informed me, heated as hot as the patient can bear them, and 
then apphed to the feet. The red variety also is chiefly em- 
ployed in the various ornaments, crosses, rosaries, candle- 
sticks, &c., &c., which are manufactured by hand, in the 
most elegant manner, by a carpenter of Cardona. Some of 
these ornaments I sent to England from Tarragona, and am 
happy in having it in my power to contradict the prevalent 
notion, that, though in Spain they are as hard and durable as 
the vases, &c., made of Derbyshire spar in England, on arriv- 
ing in this country they immediately melt, owing to the hu- 
midity of the climate. A temple, and a pair of candlesticks, 
have been in England since January ; and, on my opening the 
case containing them, last week, I found that, though they had 
rather a moist feel, they exhibited no signs of decay, and I 
hope and trust they will long remain in a sound and perfect 
state among the other curiosities of my collection. 

A river, or what, like most Spanish rivers, would be termed 
in England a trout stream, flows along about a stone's throw 
from the salt hill, into which trickles a small streamlet, whether 
produced by the dissolving of the salt, or originating in some 
spring near, I could not discover. I tasted the water near its 
entrance into, and at several places lower down, the river, but 
could not discover any thing brackish or unpleasant in it. 
During the heavy rains, however, which occasionally fall in 
Catalonia, rendering the high roads, which, as in most parts 
of Spain, are at other times excellent, more like ploughed 
fields than thoroughfares, an immense quantity of salt is, the 
administrador informed me, washed down into the Cardonero, 
and the fish are destroyed for leagues. The salt, however, 
must afterwards evaporate [?], as no deposit can be made of 
it in the bed of the river, judging from, as I have before ob- 
served, the perfectly fresh taste of the water. 

Bowles, according to Patrin [Histoire Naturelle des Mi- 
veraux, v. 370.), states that the sal-gemma of Cardona has 
the property of decomposing nitre : a kind of aqnafortis is 
made out of it, and the jewellers of Madrid, who commonly 
make use of it, assert that it does not attack gold ; *' une ob- 
servation," remarks Patrin, " qui seroitfort singuli^re si elle 
seroit confirmee. II seroit a desirer qu'un chimiste vouliit 
bien verifier ce fait." In order, therefore, that this fact may 
be verified by experiment, I enclose a specimen of the rose- 
coloured variety, and also one of the salt in its purest, or 
rather, I should say (for it is all pure), its most powerful state, 
which, as you will observe, is transparent, and in many re-

by some competent chemist. 

[We purpose to send the specimens, as soon as we have a 
printed copy of our correspondent's communication ready to 
be sent with them, to some friend versed in chemical analysis, 
whose report upon the salts we hope to give in a future 
Number.] 

Notwithstanding the immense quantity of salt which might 
be drawn from these works, sufficient for the supply, not only 
of all Spain, but, I might perhaps say, the whole of Europe, 
such are the absurd regulations prevailing in every branch of 
industry in that lovely but unfortunate country, that the sale 
of it is confined to a circle of about seven leagues, including 
the large manufacturing town of Manresa : beyond which it 
is contraband. The surrounding country, though patches of 
the most beautiful woodland occasionally occur, has, for the 
most part, a sad, dreary, desolate look : for miles and miles, 
with the exception of here and there a train of asses or mules 
laden w^ith sacks containing salt, and the whirr of a covey of 
red-legged partridges started up from their heathy roost, not 
a sound is heard, not a living creature is seen. The rugged 
barren nature of the country, indeed, joined to the fierce vin- 
dictive character of its inhabitants, had the effect of scaring 
the French off during the Peninsular war ; and the castle of 
Cardona, which, though situated on an eminence, and strongly 
fortified, is by no means impregnable, was one of the very few 
fortresses which never, during that six years' bloody warfare, 
received a French garrison within its walls. It was also the 
only fortress never taken during the war of succession, but 
was delivered up in 1715, after the glorious but fruitless de- 
fence of Barcelona by the Catalans, against the united forces 
of France and Spain : a defence unparalleled in the annals 
of history, save by those of Gerona and Saragossa in later 
times. 

There are thirty-five labourers employed on these salt- 
works, who receive five rials, about 13^. a day; and twenty 
guards keep watch night and day in order to prevent any of 
the salt being stolen : such is the wretched character for rob- 
bery and murder borne by the surrounding inhabitants ; a 
character, indeed, which seems vindictive in the extreme. No- 
where, in any of my rides in Spain, did I meet with crosses, 
those Spanish signs of blood and vengeance, in such numbers 
as on the by bridle-road from Cardona to Cervera. 

The salt mountain formerly belonged to the Duke of Me- 
dina-Celi, and the manner by which it fell into royal hands 



at Cardona, in Catalonia. 643 

is rather amusing, and was told me with great glee by my 
host at Cardona. Charles III., the only wise man in his 
family, as the Spaniards call him, hearing of the great value 
of the mountain, determined to get it into his own clutches ; 
and for that purpose observed carelessly one day to the Duke 
of Medina- Cell, that he understood his salt possessions brought 
him in a large annual rent. " A mere trifle," replied the duke, 
who, like all Spaniards, wished to conceal his wealth, naming 
about one third of the actual amount. " If that is the case," 
rejoined the king, " I will give you double, and make as much 
more out of them as I can." To hear, in those despotic times, 
was to obey; and thus the Duke of Medina-Celi lost one of 
the fairest possessions of his powerful house : for, as may 
easily be imagined, from the proverbial good faith of a Bour- 
bon, after the death of that king, the promised tribute was 
nevier paid, and they now belong entirely to the queen regent, 
who farms them out to a merchant at Barcelona. 

" Spain," said Bowles (an Englishman by birth, but a 
Spaniard by adoption, who was employed by Charles III. to 
inspect and report on the then state of the mines), sixty or 
seventy years ago, " is, to the naturalist, a virgin land" {una 
tierra virgen) ; and such — in spite of her beautiful marbles, 
unrivalled by those of any country upon earth ; her noble 
forests; her numerous mines ; and splendidly plumaged-birds 
(among them the roller ; the bee-eater, which I met with in 
May last, as common as swallows, along the banks of the Tagus, 
between Toledo and Aranjuez; the azure-winged jay, &c.), 
vying with the most magnificent species of the torrid zone, in 
brilliancy and variety of colouring — she has since continued, 
and appears still destined to remain. No one, indeed, in their 
senses, would naturalise in a country, where, in addition to the 
chance of being stripped naked, soundly bastinadoed, and left 
tied to a tree all night (for such is the mode of punishment 
inflicted by those worthies, Spanish robbers, on any person 
who has the misfortune to fall into their clutches, and whose 
purse does not appear to them sufficiently well lined with 
dollars), a naturalist is subject to such barbarous treatment as 
1 received, though my passport was perfecdy regular, in Ja- 
nuary last, in the Catalonian Pyrenees. For four nights I 
slept in dungeons on straw ; one of these nights with irons of 
the most barbarous description on my feet ; for two days and 
a half I was marched through the country bound, like a robber 
or a cut-throat, hand and foot to my horse with cords ; in 
company with my guide, who was treated in a similar manner ; 
under a guard of twelve armed men, to Talarn, the capital of

the district, and the residence of the governor. All this was 
owing to a hot-headed captain of volunteers taking it into his 
mind that I must needs be one of the two foreigners he had 
shortly before (such at least was the excuse made for him by 
the authorities, when called to account for such extraordinary 
conduct by the British ambassador at Madrid) received orders 
to search for, arrest, and send under a strong escort to Talarn 
to be shot ! The governor, after examining my passport, and 
asking me a great many questions, of course set me at liberty ; 
but, on my expressing my indignation at the brutal treatment 
to which I had been subjected, he had the audacity to tell me 
that I had no right to complain, for Spaniards were every bit 
as free as Englishmen, and the same thing might have hap- 
pened to himself, had he been travelling in England ; and that, 
as I had stated my chief object, in wandering about the moun- 
tains, to be, to collect pieles and piedras {skins and sUmes), he 
really did not feel very much surprised at what had happened ! 
Such an unknown species of biped is a naturalist in Spain.

Art. VII. Facts and Considerations on the Strata of Mont Blanc ; 
and on some Instances of Twisted Strata observable in Switzer- 
land ; by J. R. : with Remarks thereon^ by the Rev. W. B. 
Clarke, A.M. F.G.S, &c. 

The granite ranges of Mont Blanc are as interesting to the 
geologist as they are to the painter. The granite is dark 

red, often enclos- 
ing veins of quartz, 
crystallised and 
compact, and like- 
wise well-formed 
crystals of schorl. 
The average ele- 
vation of its range 
of peaks, which ex- 
tends from Mont 
Blanc to the Tete 
Noire, is about 
12,000 English feet 
above the level of 
the sea. [Its high- 
est culminating 
point is 15,744 
feet.] The Aiguille de Servoz (^^.70.), and that of Dru

iJg' "71'), are excellent examples of the pyramidal and 
splintery formation which these granite ranges in general 

assume. They rise 
out of immense 
fields of snow; but, 
being themselves 
too steep for snow 
to rest upon, form 
red, bare, and in- 
accessible peaks, 
which even the cha- 
mois scarcely dares 
to climb. Their 
bases appear some- 
times abutted 
against (if I may 
so speak) by mica 
slate, which forms 
the south-east side 
of the Valley of 
Chamonix ; whose 
flanks, if inter- 
sected, might appear as in^^. 72. a, Granite, forming on the 
one side (b) the Mont Blanc, on the other (c) the Mont Breven ;

tains amianthus and 
quartz, in which capil- 
lary crystals of tita- 
nium occur; c, calca- 
reous rock ; d, alluvium, forming the Valley of Chamonix. 
I should have mentioned that the granite appears to contain 
a small quantity of gold, as that metal is found among the 
granite debris and siliceous sand of the river Arve IBakewell, 
i. 375.] ; and I have two or three specimens in which chlorite 
(both compact and in minute crystals) occupies the place of 
mica. — J. R, March, 1834.

The granites of the Mont Blanc have already been ably 
described by various geologists; as Saussure, De Luc, the 
writer in Ebel, Mr. Bakewell, &c. The latter author has given 
a coloured view of the Aiguille de Dru as a frontispiece to 

T T 3 



646 Facts and Coiisideratiojis 

vol. ii. of his Travels in the Tarentaise ; and a description of the 
rocks, ii. 12. The granite is not always a "dark red," for the 
glaciers are strewed with blocks and fragments of differently 
coloured granites ; and, among others, with the peculiar white 
granite from the summits of the Aiguilles and of the Mont 
Blanc, which are, perhaps, the most common. This granite is 
traceable by its character, and may be picked up at the edge 
of the ice on Montanvert, as well as all along the route of its 
transport, as far as the Jura. See Bakewell, vol. i. p. 375-6.* 
J. R.*s sketches give a good idea of the pyramidal forms of 
the aiguilles. There is a large lithographic plate of Mont Blanc, 
taken from Servoz, by Villeneuve, which is worth the pur- 
chasing, if it fall in the way of a collector. It gives the whole 
range frqm Chamonix, with the intermediate mountains, and 
the vale between it and Servoz. f Mr. Charles Fellows, a fel-

prehensive speculations. They scarcely consort enough with the present 
subject to be very fitly attached here ; but they cannot fail to excite 
welcomely the imagination of the general reader. On this account we 
hope that neither ]VL:. Clarke nor J. R. will disapprove our attachment of 
them. 

" Those naturalists who have seen the glaciers of Savoy, and who have 
beheld the prodigious magnitude of some fragments conveyed by them 
from the higher regions of Mont Blanc to the valleys below, to a distance 
of many leagues, will be prepared to appreciate the effects which a series 
of earthquakes might produce in this region, if the peaks, or * needles * as 
they are called, of Mont Blanc were shaken as rudely as many parts 
of the Andes have been in our times." — Ly ell's Princij)les of Geology y 
vol. iii. 

" The rapid change which is now going on in the greatest altitudes of 
Switzerland, points out to us the mode in which nature is operating by 
decomposition, and the attraction of gravitation. When standing on the 
borders of the Mer de Glace, and while crossing its frozen bosom, this 
operation was brought most forcibly to my mind. Every moment my ears 
were saluted with the sound, more or less distant, of rocks precipitated 
from some height into the abysses below, and which reverberated over 
this frozen sea. The time may come when the pinnacles of Mont Blanc 
and other mountains which surround the beautiful valley of Chamouni, 
will have been precipitated to their bases, and the debris be so completely 
carried off as to leave, perhaps, that beautiful and fertile spot itself, the 
highest pinnacle of the country, a naked rock to be gazed at from a dis- 
tance." — Lea's Contributions to Geology (Philadelphia, 1833), Introd. 
p. 16, 17.] 

f The allusion to the Valley of Chamonix recalls to my mind that splendid 
and beautiful poem, upon which alone the lately deceased Mr. Coleridge 
might have rested his fame as one of the greatest of our modern bards. 
There is nothing, if we except Milton, in the whole range of English blank 
verse, at all comparable with the Hymn whence the following extract is 
made : — 

" Ye Ice falls ! ye that from the mountain's brow 
Adown enormous ravines slope amain — 
Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty Voice, 



on the Strata of Mont Blafic. 647 

low-traveller of mine (who, in 1827, ascended Mont Blanc), 
has given, in his Narrative of the Ascent^ a good view of it, 
with the glaciers and aiguilles, as taken from the Breven with 
a camera obscura ; and also another from the Col de Balme ; 
both of these convey a perfect idea of the perpendicularity 
of the stratification, though the former is out of proportion, 
Mr, De la Beche has the best view from the Breven, in his 
Sections and Views. Mr. Havves, who ascended with Mr. Fel- 
lows, thinks Mr. Fellows's drawings rather too imaginative ; 
and I think so too. The same remarks apply to Mr. Auldjo's 
views. J. R.'s sketches {Jigs, 70, 71.) are illustrative; and 
are, therefore, though not novel, worth preserving. 

The granite of Mont Blanc is said to contain gold. Gold 
is very common in all soils and in most river beds ; though 
in quantity too minute to be observable. It is universally 
distributed, and may be procured from decayed vegetable 
matter. It is obtained in small quantities near Simplon, on 
the route of that name : most alluvial deposits have traces of 
it. See the localities and river beds named by Leonhard and 
Phillips and Jameson. The washing of the sand of the Rhine 
at Baden produced, in 1827, 2317 kr. 53 J gr. of gold; from 
1828 to 1829, 2999 kr. 44?iigr. {Allgemeine Handlimg Zei^ 
tung, Oct. 1829.) Gold is also found in the rivers of the north 
of Moldavia ; in the Goldbach near Audel, in Treves ; near 
Endkirch on the Moselle ; and in the Guldenbach near Strom- 
berg, in the neighbourhood of Coblentz. (Gruithuisen, 
Analeldenfur Erd und Himmels-hunde, part iii. p. 36.) 

The chloritic granite, of which J. R. has spoken, comes 
from the Col de Geant: the red granite from the Aiguille de 
Blaittiere. A far more striking discovery would be that of 
sulphur in the granite, which has been, in some cases, found.

Twisted Strata. — The contortions of the limestone at 
the fall of the Nant d'Arpenaz, on the road from Geneva to 
Chamonix, are somewhat remarkable. [Seejig, 7 5. in p. Q5 1 .'] 
The rock is a hard dark brown limestone, forming part of a 
range of secondary cliffs, which rise from 500 ft. to 1000 ft. 
above the defile which they border. The fall itself is about 
800 ft. high. The strata bend very regularly ; except [at e and 
f\ where they appear to have been fractured. — J. R. Mai'ch, 
1834. [.T. R. sent with this communication a small neat copy 
of a sketch carefully taken on the spot; but as this did not 
exhibit the stratification so distinctly as one which the Rev. 
W. B. Clarke has since supplied {Jfg-75.), we have only 
engraved the latter ; into which we have endeavoured to in- 
troduce the letters e and^ in the points in which J. R. had, 
in his own sketch, exhibited them. The following remarks 
are by Mr. Clarke.] 

Nant * (TArpenaz, — J. R.'s drawing is too indistinct to 
give an idea of the stratification. The curvature of the 
strata is a disputed point. Saussure first stated the cir- 
cumstance ; subsequently, Mr. Bakewell has considered the 
appearances an illusion produced by the cleavage. I am 
compelled to differ from him, and to adhere to Saussure; 
who mentions that the strata, being originally horizontal, are 
bent upwards, and then curved backwards. (See Bakewell's 
Travels^ vol. i. p. 339.) In the year 1825, I spent two days, 
in July, in examining the whole of the strata on both sides of 
the Nant d'Arpenaz, and, in fact, all that side of the Valley 
of Maglanz from CI use to St. Martin ; and I confess that 
there are so many instances of contorted and perpendicular 
strata in the limestone, that I came to the conclusion that the 
rocks at Arpenaz, as well as at Nant d'Orli, are merely por- 
tions of a great range of strata, which, owing to vast press-ure 
and elevation of the subjacent beds, have been forced out of 
their horizontal position. f The falls, in both instances, rush 
over the face of the rock ; where there is, evidently, a fissure, 
apparently caused by a crack upwards through the cliffs. 
The real curves in the beds are explained in the appended 
diagrams, which were made in 1825. 

* Nayd^ in the language of the country, means a waterfall. 

f The following passage is also corroborative of Saussure's opinion 
upon the subject: — " Ein schones vielfaches Echo empfangt hier den

der Gebirgstrom Arpenas (Nant cT Arpenaz) als Wasserfall herab, der auch

At Cluse {Jig, 73.)5 the rocks are so curved that they over- 
hang the river and road ; and, near Cluse, the mountams are 
split from top to bottom, forming the Vale of Reposoir ; and the 
same singularities are remarked at various places throughout 
the Valley of Maglanz, It had been my intention to draw up 
a paper on this valley, as offering some peculiarly interesting 
geological features ; but the design was abandoned, from a 
pressure of more serious matters. The remarks of J. R, have 
reminded me, however, of it, and I shall add a few observ- 
ations from my note book. As confirmatory of the views I 
have taken on the point, I may quote, at once, the words of 
MM. Barbe and Robert; who travelled through Lorraine 
and Switzerland in 1830, and published their observations in 
the Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France^ 1 6mo, tom. i. 
p. 89. : — " La montagne schisteuse est singulierement repliee, 
d'ou se precipite la cascade d'Arpenaz, la suivante, formee 
d'ardoise, enfin une troisieme situee entre elles, au fond d'une 
petite gorge, forment par les directions de leurs couches, re- 
presentees par des lignes droites, un veritable triangle place 
obliquement sur une de ses pointes." Nant d'Orli is the fall 
alluded to in the latter part of this observation ; and the first 
grand variation from the horizontal position of the strata which 
occurs, is at Nant d'Orli. This is a beautiful cascade, which 
tumbles down the fiice of the rocks immediately behind the 
little village of Maglanz, from which it sometimes is called 
the Cascade of Maglanz. [Jig. 74.) The height of the fall may 
be about 500 ft.: it is not of any great breadth, but the water

falls with sufficient volume and force to work a saw-mill, built 
across the rivulet which carries it to the Arve. 

A vast mass of ruin is accumulated at the foot of the fall, the 
debris of the higher rocks, and on the summit of it there are 
growing pines of a great age.* We might almost suppose that 
these fragments were hurled down by the catastrophe which 
caused the Jault by which the cascade was formed, and the 
size of the fragments affords an additional proof; so vast are 
many of them, that some children who were climbing them 
in search of wild strawberries, cherries, &c., whose voices 
jrere long heard, and directed us to their situation, were some 
fiime invisible to us, being hidden under the shadow of these 
mighty " screes^^ as they would be called in Cumberland. 

The strata here are bent downwards on either side of the 
fall, so as to form a crevice in the front of the rocks which 
presents the more backward strata in the regular order, over 
which the water is projected. Tig. 74. will explain this. On 
a first inspection, it seems as if the strata had been bent down- 
wards, continued horizontally in a lower position, and then 
bent upwards again to their former level. The continued 

* [" What a noble tree is a mighty pine ! when growing in the situation 
it is intended for, on the mountain side ; based on the solid rock, which 
its huge roots enfold, and, stretching deep, bind to the parent earth ; its 
enormous trunk, unbent by storm or time, reaches towards heaven, * lythe 
by degrees and beautifully less j ' its dependent limbs, laden with persistent 
verdure, shake icy winter proudly from their crest. Truly the pine is the 
mountain forest king, as the oak is that of the plain." — Robei't Mallety Esq.

The thickness of the strata varies from 1 ft. to 20 ft., and in

About half a league farther, the scene is graced by another 
most splendid fall, called Nant d'Arpenaz {Jig^ 75. and 76.), 
which comes down through a height of 800 ft. or 900 ft. in a 
brilliant descent. When the air is calm, and there has been 
a continuance of fine weather, the volume of water is by no 
means considerable ; but after rain it is magnificent, and, if 
by chance a brisk wind should be blowing up or down the 
valley, the falling water is borne away along the surface of 
the rocks, till it becomes an invisible mist, when by its depo- 
sition it is again condensed and accumulated into another fall 
of equal beauty, so continuing its descent into its rocky basin 
below, whence it is carried, as the waters of Nant d'Orli are, 
to the river Arve. The beauty of this fall is not its only 
charm : for the extraordinary position of the strata near it 
demands equal observation. Approaching it from Nant d'Orli,

upon the summit of the cliffs, which here appear sunk and 
shattered, the traveller is greeted with a view of what he 
at first believes to be an ancient castle, citadeled in the 
mountains. Seen, as the writer and his companion saw it, 
lit up by the bright rays of a setting sun, while the neigh- 
bouring rocks were in shade, it had a most beautiful and 
magical appearance : but it afterwards was found to be pro- 
duced by a portion of the rock, which, by some cause, has 
been tossed over from its horizontal position, and piled up 
perpendicularly into the fanciful forms of turrets, towers, and 
bastions : there are even openings in these fragments in the 
exact position and shape of windows. (See^^. 77.) 

Immediately in conjunction with these, the subjacent and 
adjacent strata are bent upwards in their centre, at an 
angle of about 30°, and then continued regularly to the edge 
of the waterfall, which comes from a deep fissure through the 
mountain, and probably communicates with the feeders of 
Nant d'Orli, of which it may be only another branch : but 
of this it is almost impossible to be convinced by actual ob- 
servation, on account of the steepness and distance of the 
mountains. On the right of the fall, instead of a horizontal 
position, the strata are deposited in concentric arches upon a 
diameter which forms the right cheek of the fissure. (See y^. 
75.) By what extraordinary convulsion this can have been 
produced, there is no means of determining : for, although 
there are in this neighbourhood unequivocal marks of most ex- 
traordinary derangement, the extreme variety of forms which 
the strata assume baffles investigation. The concentric arches, 
above mentioned, are at first perfectly circular, but, as the 
middles of the strata are thicker than the extremities, they 
gradually become more and more eccentric, until, as they 
appear a few hundred paces farther up the river, they assume 



654 Meteors on Nov. 13. 1834-. 

so angular a form as to be nearly doubled under each other. 
Yet between these and the former, and but little above the 
surface, there are other circular arches, which, instead of 
being deposited in the same manner as the others, have their 
diameter horizontal. Farther up, among the recesses of the 
hills, there are fragments of exotic masses, which have been 
brought together from various places, and piled one over the 
other in " most admired disorder." As far, too, as the eye 
can trace and the rocks are bare, the higher strata, as they 
recede in perspective, appear to be laid in every irregular 
position, some depressed, and others elevated, as if various 
powers had been brought to bear upon them from above and 
below. 

The most natural conclusion is, that there are, probably, 
large reservoirs of water on the mountains above, which, at 
some early period, whether by an extraordinary accumula- 
tion, or by the recession of the subjacent rocks, were preci- 
pitated in a flood to the valley, bearing with them the huge 
masses which lie about in so many rude fragments. But this 
could not have caused the contortions in the strata which are 
so remarkable. 

The natural colour of the limestone is a deep indigo, but 
from meteoric causes the surface has assumed a yellowish and 
brownish tint, while fragments are strewed about, which have 
passed through the fire of a kiln at the foot of the fall, of a 
light gravelly red. At this spot, there is a surprising echo, 
which is " shown off" by the discharge of a small cannon ; 
for the employment of which, the traveller is charged a fee 
which would not be unworthy of the guides who minister in 
the Devil's Cave, at Castleton, in the Peak. 

The diagrams here given in illustration are not drawn with

\_A Postscript to Mr. darkens Communication, ending in 
p. 630. — The appearing of Meteors in November, in different 
Years, (p. 386, 387.) An Instance for 1834.] — On the return 
[in 1834] of the period when the meteors, of which I have 
said so much, were seen in 1799, 1832, and 1833, I felt 
naturally anxious to watch the atmosphere. My health, how- 
ever, did not allow me to remain up all night; but on rising, 
at three o'clock in the morning of Nov. 13., I saw from my 
window, in fifteen minutes' time by the watch, fifteen falling 
stars, in the direction of a line from Leo to the star Miza in 
Ursa major. The night was cloudless, and the moon so 



Wo7'kso7i Natural History, 655 

bright, that the constellations could be scarcely seen ; but the 
meteors were very red and brilliant. The wind blew briskly 
from E.N.E., and freshened after every meteor. The coinci- 
dence between these and those before seen in America and 
Europe (p. 289. 385. 61 1.) on this day of the month is curious ; 
but those which I now mention were decidedly electrical, and 
of no uncommon character. One meteor fell to the south of 
Ursa major, and appeared to pass between Cor Caroli and 
Arcturus. There were no trains. Should any correspondent 
of the Magazine have made any farther observations, I shall 
be obliged for the statement of them. — W, B. Clarke.
