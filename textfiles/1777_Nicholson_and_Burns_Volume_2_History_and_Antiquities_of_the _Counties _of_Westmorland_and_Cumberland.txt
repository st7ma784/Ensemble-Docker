WESTMORLAND and CUMBERLAND. 

OF CUMBERLAND IN GENERAL. 

CUMBERLAND, according to Mr. Denton, on the fouth-weft part 
thereof, is divided from Furnefs, which is a part of the county of 
Lancafter, by the river Dudden, which falls into the Irifh fea at Mil- 
ium caftle â€¢, afcending by the banks of that river up to Ulfay or Woolf hey park 
at Blackhill, to the (hire ftone upon the mountain Wrynofe at the head of 
Dudden, where it meets with the county of Weftmorland, firft at Little Lang- 
dale in the fells â€¢, fo, leaving on the eaft Great Langdale and Grefmere, it bor- 
dereth on the fame all the way to Dunmaile Raife ; and thence on the backfide 
of Hilvellen or Hill-Belyne hill, by the head of Glenrhodden beck, to the 
head of Glencune beck; and fo, down that rill or little beck Glencune, to 
Ulfwater ; thence, by the river Aymot, which runneth forth of Ulfwater at 
Pooley flank, deicending by Dacre caftle and Carleton until it receive the river 
Lowther under Brougham caftle, and till it be received by the great river 
Eden ; and fo up Eden unto the foot of Kirkland and Newbiggin beck, by 
which it is fevered from Weftmorland until it come to the head fpring thereof. 
It joins again with Weftmorland in the mountains, for the fpace of five or fix 
miles ; then meeting with a little corner of Yorkfhire, it is bounded by the 
fame to the head of the great river Tees, which divideth there Yorkfhire from 
the county of Durham ; and from thence to Kellowplaw hill by the fame 
county of Durham. From Kdloplaw hill to Alnburne it adjoineth to the

county of Northumberland, which burn or little river unto Kirkhaugh (where 
it is received of the great river South Tyne) divideth the two counties, which 
in like manner on the other fide of Tyne are kept afunder by another little 
rill falling into Tyne from the Eaft fide of the mountains in Geltfdale foreft ; 
from that little water unto the head of Hartley burn-, and then along the 
north eaft fide of Geltfdale foreft, and on Burntippet moor (a great heath and 
wafte), the faid two counties of Cumberland and Northumberland meet again, 
and are not fevered until a little beck called Powtrofs parts them, which fall- 
ing into Irthing lofeth its name. And then Irthing divides them, afcending 
the fame river, until it receive a leffer water named Troutbeck, which in like 
fort falleth in between them, until they concur again at the Horfehead, the 
Gill cragg, and Chriftenbury cragg, unto Lamyford, where Cumberland 
makes a narrow point northwards. There the river Liddale on the north weft 
fide runs down between Scotland and Cumberland unto Canonby holme, where 
the water of Elk receives it, and bereaves Liddale of its name, at a place 
called the Mote. Then defcending Efk a little way, the Scotch dyke divides 
the two kingdoms from Efk to Sark, which falling into Efk, and fo with Elk 
into Eden aforefaid, are prefently carried together into Solway firth, and fo to 
the Irifh fea. From the foot of Eden, Cumberland on the weft fide, bending 
all along the coaft fouthward like a bow, is invironed by the Irifh fea to the 
foot of the river Dudden at Milium caftle aforefaid. 

It extendeth in length, from the fouth end of Peil de Fodra on the fouth 
point of the faid county, to the north point thereof near Lamyford above 
feventy miles; and reacheth in breadth from Allonby on the weft to Newbig- 
gin bridge on the eaft thirty miles ; and hath in circumference upwards of two 
hundred miles. 

Mr. Houghton tells us, from fome calculations made by Dr. Halley, that 
it contains 1040000 acres; is a 38^ part of the whole kingdom â€¢, that there 
are in it 14.825 houfes, and that in this refpect it is about a 784. part of the 
kingdom *. It is fuppofed there may now be about 20000 houfes, and near 
1 00000 inhabitants. 

Cumberland firft took its name from the inhabitants, who were the true and 
genuine Britons, and called themfelves Kimbri or Kumbri. For that the 
Britons in the heat of the Saxon wars pofted themfelves here for a long time, 
we have the authority of our hiftories and of Marianus himfelf -f-, who calls 
this country Cumbrorum terra, that is, the land of the Cumbri : Not to men- 
tion the names of many places purely Britifh ; fuch as Caer-luel, Caer-dronoc, 
Penrith, Pen-rodoc, and the like. 

The firft inhabitants of Britain, according to Mr. Carte J, were a Celtic 
nation, who firft fettled here about 2000 years before the chriftian a;ra ||. 

* Houghton, vo!. i. p. 71. f Camd. p. 1002. X Carte, vol. i. p. 21. 

I) Thefe people generally called themfelves Celts, which fignihed as much as a man of extraor- 
dinary worth and accampliihments, and which bifhep Nicolfon brings from the primitive Celt, fig- 
nifying God ; as they, as .veil as moil other nations, affecled to trace up their deicent as high as the 
cscation. So the word Gothic from Gott or God; and Teutch from Teut who they faid was the 
ten of God.

And the Britifh government was anciently divided amongft a great number 
of chieftains, much in the fame manner as the clans in the Highlands of Scot- 
land, and the Septs in Ireland â€¢, though they are frequently dignified by Our 
writers with the pompous titles of kings. 

And we are told, that about the year of Chrift 448, the mod confiderable 
kingdom among the Britons was that of the Strath Cluyd Britons, called ge- 
nerally the kingdom of Cumbria, and which then comprehended all the weftern 
Lowlands of Scotland as far as Dunbritton, and was further extended by the 
union of North Wales, upon Coil's marrying the heirefs of that principality, 
and by the acceflion of the intermediate countries lying in the Irifh channel, 
which upon the Romans quitting Britain had put themfelves under the pro- 
tection of the Strath Cluyd princes. Thefe territories were all united under 
Eneon Urdd. But this union continued no longer than his life ; and his do- 
minions being divided amongft his pofterity formed the principalities of North 
"Wales, Cumberland, and Galloway. 

Northumberland was the fifth kingdom of the Saxon heptarchy, which be- 
gan under Ida, in the year 548, and was fo called lying north of the river 
Humber, and extended from that river to St. Johnfton's in Scotland. Cum- 
berland was undoubtedly included within the bounds of this kingdom, but (as 
is before mentioned) was always governed by its own king or rather chieftain, 
and lived under what was called the Danes Law till the conqueft*. 

In the year 878, Alfred king of the Weft Saxons fubdued the Northumbers, 
and indeed the whole kingdom, and reduced it again to one intire monarchy; 
He alfo divided the kingdom into certain parts or fections, which from the 
Saxon word fcyran, fignifying to cut, he termed /hires or fhares, and appointed 
over every fhire an earl or alderman, to whom he committed the rule and go- 
vernment of the fame : and comes being latin for a count or an earl, thence came 
the word county for a fhire ; and vifcount, the fheriff, (hire's reeve, or county's 
deputy. 

Thefe fhires he broke into fmaller parts commonly called hundreds, but in 
this county wards, from the watching and warding that were neceffary againft 
the neighbouring incurfions â€¢, and thefe wards are five in number, viz. Aller- 
dale ward above Derwent, Allerdale ward below Derwent, Cumberland ward, 
Leeth ward, and Efkdale ward. 

In the year 945, Edmund king of England, having wafted all Galloway, 
and intirely fubdued the Britons in Cumberland, gave that principality to Mal- 
colm king of Scotland, on condition of guarding the Northumbrian territories 
by fea and land from the enemy's invafions -f. 

In 1032, Malcolm the fecond and Canute quarrelling raifed great armies 
againft each other ; but their difference, by the interpolation of the prelates 
and nobles, was accommodated : and it was agreed, that Duncan (the Scotch 
king's heir apparent) and the heirs of all future kings of Scotland for the time 
being fhould hold Cumberland as freely as any of their predeceffors had 
done J.

In 1068, king William the Conqueror made peace with Malcolm, who did 
him homage for Cumberland *. 

But in the very next year Malcolm again joined the difconrented Englifh-, and 
Will am having fubdued him added Cumberland to the Englifh pale: But it 
was miferably haraffed all along by its reftlefs neighbours out of Scotland ; as 
were no lefs the Scotch adjoining territories by plundering parties of England. 

In the 5 Ed. 2. Robert de Brus, king of Scotland, entred Cumberland by 
Sol way with a great army on Thurfday before the day of the AfTumption of 
the Blefied Virgin, and burned all Gilfland, with the village of Haltwyfil in 
Northumberland, and great part of Tindale ; and after eight days returned 
with much booty. In Auguft he came again to Lanercoft, (laid there three 
days, and did much mifchief. 

In the 8 Ed. 2. Edward de Brus, brother of Robert, entered Cumberland, 
and tarrying at Rofe three whole days, fent out parties to burn, deftroy, and 
plunder on all fides. And before Midfumrner in that year the county of Cum- 
berland alone gave 300 marks to the Scots by way of contribution. 

In the 10 Ed. 2. the Scots again entred Cumberland, and proceeding as far 
as Richmond in Yorkshire with all poflible devaluation, from thence turned to- 
wards Furnefs in Lancafhire, burning and deftroying all the way they went: 
And here they were much pleafed with finding large quantities of iron, which 
did not abound in Scotland. The Chronicle adds, that in this year, plague 
and famine raged both in England and Scotland, to a degree till then unheard 
of; and that the quarter of bread corn fold in the north for forty fhillings. 

In the 13 Ed. 2. the Scots came again, and deftroyed all before them with 
fire and fword as far as Burgh under Stanemore. 

In the 16 Ed. 2. Robert de Brus again entered Cumberland, burnt Rofe, 
plundered the abbey of Holm Cultram, and deftroyed all with fire and fword 
as far as Lancafhire, and returned home with much booty. 

In the 5 Ed. 3. on the 22d of March the Scots again enter England by 
Carlifle, and there burn, kill, and deftroy as ufual. And on the Vigil of the 
Annunciation, Anthony lord Lucy enters Scotland, and for 12 miles kills, burns, 
and deftroys in the fame manner. On his return he was attacked near Dornock 
by Sir Humphrey de Boys, Sir Humphrey de Jardayne, William Bard, Wil- 
liam de Douglafs, and 50 more well armed men, with the commons of the 
whole country. They all with one accord rufhed upon the perfon of lord 
Lucy, but he was fo well defended, that the two Scotch knights, and about 
24 armed men were killed, William Bard and William Douglafs taken, and 
the reft put to flight. Of the Englifh, only two efquires, Thomas de Plum- 
land and John de Ormefby were flain: their bodies were carried to Carlifle, 
and there honourably interred. Lord Lucy himfelf was indeed wounded ia 
the foot, hand, and eye, but foon recovered. 

In the 1 1 Ed. 3. in the beginning of September, the earl of Warwick en- 
tred Scotland with an army by Berwick ; as did alio Thomas Wake baron of 
Liddale, lord Clifford, the lord of Gilfland, and the bifhop of Carlifle, by 
Carlifle; and joining forces, they wafted Teviotdale, MofFetdale, and Nithci-

dale â€¢, and lord Lucy, with a part of the faid army, ravaged Galloway. In re- 
turn, the Scots entred England near Carlifle about the middle of October, and 
mewing themfelves for three days together on the eaft fide of the city, chal- 
lenged the befieged to open battle. This they declined, but fent out archers 
and others to harafs them in their tents. Notwithstanding which, they fur- 
rounded the town, burned the hofpital of St. Nicholas, and Rofe, and all the 
places they palled through. 

In the 19th of the fame king, the Scots entered England by Carlifle, burned 
Gilfland and Penrith with the adjacent villages. And in the next year king 
David in perfon wafted Cumberland, Derwent Fells, and Alfton-moor, with 
fire and fword, and returned unhurt, with a great booty. But in the next 
year, the fame king David was taken prifoner at the battle of Durham. 

In the 6 Ric. 2. the Scots entred with fire and fword into Cumberland and 
"Weftmorland and the foreft of Englewood, and came to Penrith fair, where 
they rifled booths and houles, fpoiled and feized upon all the goods they found. 
there, killing and taking many, and bringing away the reft ; and fo returned 
with great riches into Scotland : But they had fmall caufe to joy in their booty ; 
for with fuch cloth and other commodities as they took away with them, they 
carried into their own country fuch a violent peftilence, that a third part of all 
the people where the infection came died thereof. The Englifh, to revenge 
the damage done by the earl of Douglafs at the fair aforefaid, raifed a power 
and went therewith over the water of Solway, and invaded the Scottifh borders 
on that fide with fire and fword, and took a great booty of cattle and other 
goods : But in the mean time the Scots hearing thereof, gathered together to 
the number of 500 men, and lurked privily in ambufh at a (trait, till fuch 
time as the Englifhmen came to pafs by them, and then with fo large a noife 
and clamour they fet upon them, that in their retreat there were 400 of the 
Englifh (lain, and a great number of the refidue for hafte were drowned in the 
v/ater of Solway â€¢, and hereby the booty of cattle and goods, which they had 
taken, was recovered again by the Scots -f. 

In the 11 Ric. 2. Robert earl of Fife, James earl of Douglafs, and Archi- 
bald lord of Galway entred into England, and came fo privately over the wa- 
ter of Solway, that they arrived at Cockermouth, and furprized the town be- 
fore the inhabitants could be prepared for any refiftance. Here they continued 
three days, got a rich booty, and with the fame returned through the counties 
of Weftmorland and Northumberland fafe, and without any encounter, again, 
into Scotland. Amongft other things found in the rifling and ranfacking of 
houfes in this journey, there was a charter mentioned of certain lands given by 
king Athelftan, which fhews the artlefs fimplicity in the manner of convey- 
ancing in thole days :

In the 27 Hen. 6. the Englifh borderers of the Weft Marches fetched a great 
booty of cattle out of Scotland : In revenge whereof the Scots invaded Eng- 
land, wafted the country, burned towns and villages, (lew the people, and 
with a great prey of prifoners, goods, and cattle returned home into Scotland. 
Hereupon daily followed inroads made on both fides between the Scots and 
Englifh, and that with fuch extreme rage and cruelty, that a great part of Cum- 
berland was in a manner laid wafte and delblate *. 

In the 1 6 Hen. 8. the lord Maxwell and Sir Alexander Jorden, with the num- 
ber of 4000 Scots, with banners difplayed, entred by Carlifle into the Weft 
Marches of England, and began to harrafs the country, and to burn on every 
fide. The Englifh perceiving this, afTembled themfelves together with all the 
forces they could fo fuddenly raife, and with the fame to the number of 2000 
men fiercely fet upon the Scots, between whom there was a cruel fight â€¢, but at 
laft the Englifhmen broke the array of the Scots, difcomfited them, and took Sir 
Alexander Jorden and his fon, and others of meaner quality, to the number of 
300 prifoners, with whom the Englifhmen that took them departed, whereby 
the ftrength of the refidue of the Englifhmen was much diminifhed. Which 
when the lord Maxwell perceived, he fuddenly rallied his men, and began a 
new fkirmifh, wherein he recovered almoft all the prifoners, and took and flew 
divers Englifhmen ; fo that he returned with victory, and carried 300 prifoners 
home with him into Scotland -f. 

Such was the ftate and condition of this county in thofe days; and fuch it 
continued during the following reigns, even after the uniting of both king- 
doms under one monarch, until the final union in the reign of queen Anne. 

Befides the apportionment of the county into Wards as aforefaid, the Ec- 
clesiastical ftate thereof fubje&s it to another divifion, namely, of the fe- 
veral bifhops fees, and the deanries therein reflectively. 

The bifhoprick of Carlifle extends into the two counties of Cumberland 
and Weftmorland, but not to the whole of either-, for all that part of Cum- 
berland called Allerdale Ward above Derwent, and the barony of Kendal in 
Weftmorland, do lie within the achdeaconry of Richmond in Chefter diocefe ; 
fo Alfton Moor, and alfo Over Denton (as it is faid), are in the diocefe of 
Durham. 

There are within the diocefe of Carlifle four deanries, viz. Carlifle, Wigton, 
Penrith, and Appleby. 

Carlifle deanry comprehends all Efkdale and Cumberland Wards, Wigton 
and Kirkbride only excepted. 

Wigton deanry takes in Wigton, Kirkbride, and all Allerdale Ward below 
Derwent. 

Penrith deanry extends through the whole bounds of Leeth Ward. 

The deanry of Appleby reacheth through all the bottom of Weftmorland, 
lying within the limits of the Eaft and Weft Wards thereof. 

Within this diocefe there is but one archdeacon, who hath the rectory of 
Great Salkeld annexed as a corps to that dignity. He had anciently archidia-

conal jurifdiction alio; but the fmallnefs and poverty of the diocefe rendring a 
concurrent jurifdiclion both inconvenient and burdenfome, he gave up the 
fame for a penfion of 3/ 19s 6d per annum, which is ftill paid him by the bi- 
fhop, and only retained the more ancient rights of examining and prefenting 
perfons to be ordained, and of inducting perlbns inftituted into their refpeclive 
livings; and all the reft of the archidiaconal jurifdi&ion is now devolved upon 
the chancellor of the diocefe.

KING William the firft, having difpofiefied the Scots of this county as 
aforefaid, gave it to Rawriph de Mefcbiens one of his Norman adventurers, 
and left him men and munition to defend the fame from all hoftility that might 
difturb its peace, either by tumult of the inhabitants, or foreign invafion. 
Ranulph, quietly pofleffed of every part thereof, prefently furveyed the whole 
country ; and gave all the frontiers bordering on Scotland, on Northumber- 
land, and along the fea coaft, unto his friends and followers ; retaining to 
himfelf the middle part between the eaft and weft mountains, a goodly great 
foreft, full of woods, red deer and fallow, wild fwine, and all manner of wild 
beafts, called the foreft of Englewood, which was fixteen miles long and ten 
broad, and lieth between the rivers of Shawk and Eden, extended in length 
from Carlifle to Penrith. The boundaries whereof, by a perambulation in the 
29 Ed. 1. are fet forth to be as follows : " Beginning at the bridge of Caldew 
V without the city of CarliQe, and fo by the highway untoThurfby towards 
" the fouth â€¢, and from Thurfby by the fame way through the middle of the 
" town of Thurfby to Wafpatrick wath, afcending by the water of Wampole 
" to the place where Shawk falls into Wampole. And from thence going up 
" ftraight to the head of Rowland beck-, and from that place defcending to 
" the water of Caldbeck â€¢, and fo clown by that water to the place where Cald- 
'* beck falls into Caldew. And fo up to Gyrgwath ; and fo by the highway. 
" of Sourby unto Stanewath under the caftle of Sourby â€¢, and fo by the high- 
" way up to Mabil crofs â€¢, and fo to the hill of Kenwathen, going down by 
" the faid highway through the middle of the town of Alleynby â€¢, and fo by 
*' the fame way through the middle of the town of Blencowe â€¢, and fo by the 
" fame way unto Palat ; and fo going down by the fame way unto the bridge 
*' of Amote ; and fo from that bridge going down by the bank of Amote unto 
** Eden ; and fo defcending by the water of Eden unto the place where Caldew 
M falls into Eden â€¢, and from that place to the bridge of Caldew aforefaid with- 
" out the gate of the city of CarliQe*."

ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT. 

The faid Ranulph de Mefchiens gave to his brother William de Mefchiens the 
great barony of Copeland, which lieth between the river Dudden, the river 
Derwent, and the fea ; and fo much of the fame as lieth between the rivers of 
Cocker and Derwent, the faid William granted over to Waldieve fon of Gof- 
patric earl of Dunbar in Scotland, together with the five towns above Cocker, 
that is to fay, Brigham, Eglesfield, Dean (with Branthwaite), Craikfothen, 
and Clifton (with the hamlets thereof, Little Clifton and Stainburn). 

The fame lord William Mefchiens feated himfelf at Egremont, where he 
built a caftle upon the top of an hill or mount nigh the river Egen (now 
corruptly called End), and thereupon he ftyled his caftle Egermont (Ege-er 
mont) ; and all fuch lands as he or his fucceffors lords of Copeland granted to 
any perfon within the barony of Copeland, they bound the fame to be holden 
of the caftle of Egremont ; and caufed the name of the barony to be changed 
from Copeland, and to be called the barony of Egremont, which name it re- 
taineth to this day. 

This William Mefchiens left no ifTue at his death, fave only a daughter 
Alice married to Robert de Romley lord of the honour of Skipton in Craven, by 
whom he had iffue a daughter named Alice, whom the faid Robert de Romley 
gave in marriage to William Fitz Duncan earl of Murray, fon of Duncan bro- 
ther of David king of Scots, which Duncan married Octhreda filter and heir 
of Waldieve fon of Alan, fon of Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale, fon of Gof- 
patric earl of Dunbar aforefaid. By which marriage of William Fitz Duncan 
with Alice de Romley, the faid William Fitz Duncan became lord both of 
Skipton and Egremont in the right of his wife, being fole heir of Skipton 
by her father, and of Egremont by her mother the lord William Mefchiens's 
daughter. 

William Fitz Duncan had iffue by the faid Aliceh'is wife, a fon called William, 
who died an infant, and by her had alio three daughters coheirs : the eldeft, 
named Cicely, was married to William le Grofs earl of Albemarle, and had iffue 
only a daughter named Hawife, who was married to three hufbands fucceffively ; 
firft, to William de Mandevill earl of Effoc, to whom fhe had no child ; fe- 
condly, to William de Fortibus ; and thirdly, to Baldwin Beton earl of the ile of 
Wight. To her fecond hufband William de Fortibus, who in her right af- 
fumed the title of earl of Albemarle, fhe had a fon William de Fortibus; who 
had iffue the third William de Fortibus ; whofe daughter and heir Aveline (wife 
to Edmund Crouchback king Edward the firft's brother) dying without any 
child, the third part of William Fitz Duncan's lands (which was Skipton in 
Craven) came to the king's hands, and by king Edward the fecond was granted 
to Robert de Clifford in exchange for the Cliffords lands in the county of Mon- 
mouth, in whole posterity it ftill remains. 

Amabil Romley, the fecond daughter of William Fitz Duncan, had for her part 
of the inherirance this barony of Egremont ; and was married to Reginald Lucy, 
by whom (lie had Richard Lucy, who had two daughters Amabil Lucy and Alice 
Lucy. 

Dame Alice Romley, third daughter and coheir of William Fitz Duncan, 
was married to Gilbert Pippard, who was juflice itinerant in Wiltfhire in the 

23 Hen. 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. 

23 Hen. 2. and afterwards was married to Robert Courtney, but had no iffue of 
her body : wherefore her part of her father's inheritance (which was the liberty 
of Cockermouth, Afpatric, and the barony of Allerdale beneath the river Der- 
went) was divided between the earl of Albemarle her elder filler's hufband, 
and Richard de Lucy her other fitter's fon. And fo it continued divided until 
the eldeft filler's iffue was extinguifhed by the death of Aveline aforefaid, 
daughter of the lad William de Fortibus ; after whofe death, all the Romley's 
lands, both above and below Derwent, came wholly to the heirs of Reginald 
Lucy and Amabil Romley his wife, fecond daughter to the faid William Fitz 
Duncan. 

Amabil Lucy and Alice Lucy, daughters and coheirs of Richard de Lucy fon 
-of Reginald Lucy and of Amabil Romley his wife, fucceedcd in the Lucy's 
lands in Cumberland. 

Amabil Lucy for her moiety enjoyed the barony of Egremont, all except 
Lowfwater ; and was married to Lambert de Multon, who had iffue Thomas de 
Multon, who had iffue another Thomas dc Multon, who had iffue a third Thomas 
de Multon, whofe fon John de Multon left the barony of Egremont to his three 
fillers coheirs ; Elizabeth, married to Haverington of Haverington ; Johan, 
married to Robert Fitz-water ; and Margaret, married to the lord 1 homas 
Lucy. At which time that barony was broken into parts, which from the 
conqueil had continued intire (except Lowfwater, and the lands between 
Cocker and Derwent, and the five towns, granted to Waldieve as is aforefaid). 
But afterwards it became again united by the earls of Northumberland lords 
thereof, by gift and purchafe, but not by defcent from the faid coheirs. 

This barony of Egremont or Copeland was firft of all demefne, but (horrty 
after the conqueft was granted away for fervices. All between Cocker and 
Derwent, and the five towns, were given by William de Meichiens to Wal- 
dieve lord of Allerdale. To Ketel fon of Eldred fon of Ivo de Talebois baron 
of Kendal, were given Kelton, Salter, Workington, and Stockhow. The 
manors of Beckermet, Frifington, Rotington, Weddekar, and Arlockden, to 
Fleming. Kirkby Begog, to the abbey of York. Mulcafter, to the ancef- 
tors of the Penningtons. Dregg and Carleton, to Stutevill. Milium, to God- 
ard Boyvil. Laftly, Sainton, Bolton, Gosfonh, and Hale, to Thomas Mul-

Within this great barony and fore (I of Copeland, now called Egremont, 
are divers knights fees and lordfhips which are manors of themfelves, holden 
of the caftle of Egremont. Amongft which manors, the lordfhip or feigniory 
of Millum (in the fouth well corner of the faid barony) is the firft, and of 
greateft liberties â€¢, containing alfo in itfelf divers manors, which are holden of 
Milium (as Milium is of Egremont) immediately, with fome difference of fervice. 

Milium feigniory or lordfhip is bounded by the river Dudden on the eaft, 
by the iflands of Wh inney and Peel de Fodra on the fouth, the Irifh ocean on 
the weft, and the river Efk and Hardknot and Wrynofe mountains on the 

Vol. II. C north.

north. It is above ten miles in length, and from the weft fea up into the 
mountains above the manor of Th wakes above fix miles in breadth and in 
form triangular. It is fo called, as it weie Meol-holme or Mil-holme, being a 
plain ground running with a fharp point into the leaj for fo the ancient inha- 
bitants termed every plain low ground near the fea, as Elk Meol, Kirkfantone 
Meole, Carl-meol (Cartmell) in Furnefs, the Mull of Galloway in- Scotland, 
and many others. 

This Milium was firft given by William de Mefchiens as aforefaid to Godart 
Boyiil, father to Godartus Dapifer, who being lord thereof gave to the abbot 
and monks of Furnefs a carucate of land with the appurtenances called Monk- 
force, which Arthur fon of Godart confirmed to that abbey, and after him 
Henry his fon and heir confirmed the fame, referving only hart and hind, wild 
boars, and their kinds, with all airies of hawks. But whatfoever was relerved 
in the firft grant, whether demefne, or foreft liberties, dame Cecily Romley 
countefs of Albemarle, one of William Fitz Duncan's coheirs, gave and con- 
firmed the fame to Henry fon of Arthur and his heirs, â€” Henrico jilio Arthuri et 
hxredibus fuis jus hareditarium, videlicet, totam terrain et totum feodum inter EJk 
et Dudden: And dame Hawife her daughter and heir, then wife of William 
Mandeville, engaged her hufband to confirm it. And for a recognition of 
the lands made to the Boyvils by dame Cecily aforefaid, they paid to king 
Henry the fecond for a poft fine one hundred pounds and five couple of hounds, 
which the record terms decern fugat ores. 

The Boyvils took their furname from this place, and were ftyled de Milium 5 
and held the fame in their ilTue male, from the reign of Hen. 1. to the reign 
of Hen. 3. for above the fpace of one hundred years, when their name and 
family ended in a daughter. And their fucceflion was as follows : 

1. Godart de Boyvil, to whom William de Mefchiens granted Milium. 

2. Godart his fon, called Godardus Dapifer. 

3. Arthur his fon. 

4. Henry fon of Arthur. 

5. William fon of Flenry. 

6. Adam brother and heir of William. 

7. Joan daughter and heir of Adam â€¢, who by marriage transferred the in> 
heritance into the Huddlefton family, which continued in the male line there 
for upwards of 500 years ; and at laft, like molt of the reft, ended in a 
daughter. 

The firft Boyvil gave his fecond fon William the manor of Kirkfanton ; 
whofe pofterity enjoyed the fame till king Edward the fecond's time. 

Godart the fecond lord gave Munkforce to the abbey of Furnefs as afore- 
faid, with the churches of Bootle and Whitcham : And all the parifhes be- 
tween Elk and Milium, to the abbey of St. Mary's York ; to which his wife 
gave alfo Anderfet, now called Agnes Seat. 

Arthur the third lord confirmed his father's grants, and granted to Furnefs 
the fervice of Kirkfanton in Milium, which Robert Boyvill his coufin-german 
then held of him, and prefently after did mortgage the fame to the abbot of 
1 urnefs, until he returned from the holy land. 

8 Henry 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Millvm.) in 

Henry the fourth lord of Milium, confirmed his anceftors grant?, and in- 
feoffed Ranulph Corbet and his heirs of the manor of Brattaby with the ap- 
purtenances in Milium. He gave Rayfthwaite in Dunderfdale to Orme fon of 
Dolphin, and Leakly (now Seaton) to Henry fon of William in frank mar- 
riage with his daughter Gunild, with fhields for her cattle, and common of 
pafture in Brockbergh and in that foreft which Gunild gave afterwards to the 
abbey of Holm Cultram, and which after that became the poffeffion of the 
nuns of Seaton. 

All the refidue of the fees in Milium were thus granted by the Boyvils to 
their children and friends, and by the Huddleftons after them ; fome as ma- 
nors, fome as freeholds only, namely, Ulpha was granted to one Ulph fon of 
Everard, whofe pofterity kept it till Henry the third's time. Ulph had iflue 
Aylward and Ketel. Aylward paid to king Hen. 2. in the 27th year of his 
reign, 20 marks for a fine affefTed on him for an attaint. Ketel had divers 
fons, Bennet, William, and Michael. Bennet lived in king John's time-, and 
had a fon named Alan. But the land was reduced into demefne again, and 
the lords of Milium inclofed there a park for deer. 

The Huddleftons derive themfelves for feveral generations before the con- 
queft, but they came not to the feigniory of Milium till Henry the third's 
time by the marriage of Sir John Huddlefton knight with Joan daughter and 
fole heir of Adam de Boyvill. And with him we begin our pedigree of the

22. Elizabeth was married to Sir Hedworth Williamfon of Monk Were- 
mouth in the county of Durham baronet, who in the year 1774 fold the eftate. 
to Sir James Lowther for upwards of 20,000/. 

The Arms of Hudlefton are Gules, a frette Argent; 

Milium lordfhip hath feveral parifhes within it. That which lies higheft 
and mod fouthwardly is Millum parish -, within which ftands the caftle of 
Milium, the capital mefluage and ancient feat of the lords thereof, which is 
placed at the foot of the river Dudden, at the eaft end of a large park well 
ftored with. deer, and formerly with great quantities of wood, which Ferdinand 
Hudlefton (having no iffue but a daughter) about the year 1690 difpofed of 
in a great meafure in building of a large (hip, and m making charcoal for his 
iron forge in that park, where he confumed (as is faid) much excellent timber, 
to the then value of 4000/ and upwards, and was little or nothing profited 
thereby. 

On the weft fide of this caftle, above the park, arifeth gradually a very 
high mountain, called Blackcomb -, which, (landing near the fea, and having the 
two level counties of Lancafhire and Chefhire on the fouth-eafl fide thereof, 
may be plainly difcovered on a clear day, from Talk on the Hill in Stafford- 
fhire, near 100 miles' diftance. And from the top of Blackcomb one may fee 
feveral mountains in-North Wales, (even Englifh counties, and as many in 
Scotland, together with the Ifle of Man. This mountain, and the ridge of 
hills which run north-weft from thence, are efteemed the belt iheep heaths in 
the country. 

This lordfhip was anciently exempted from the fheriff' s jurifdicYion, had 
power to licence their own alehoufes, and wreck of the fea is (till enjoyed 
here, whereof much benefit is frequently made, it being almoft furrounded by 
the fea.. 

The foil is pretty 'fertile, being inriched by the great quantities of fea-pingle 
which is caft out there. , Here are alfo iron mines, as is before obferved. But 
there is neither port nor creek within all this lordfhip. And the place is fo 
thinly inhabited, that the market at Milium hath been long discontinued. 

The 



I4 ALLERDALE ABOVE DER WENT. (Millum.) 

The church of Milium was given to the abbey of Furnefs in the year 1228; 
one moiety whereof was appropriated by the archbifhop of York to that mo- 
naftery, who were to prenm to the vicarage-, the other moiety the archbifhop 
rdcrvcd to his own difpofition, and in the year 1230 he affigned it for the 
maintenance of three chaplains with clerks and other charges for his chantry or- 
dained at the altar of Sr. Nicolas in the cathedral church of York. It was 
certified 10 the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 26/ is 8d. In 1714 it 
received an augmentation by 200/ given by the reverend Mr. Poftlethwaite. 
The pref. ntation (Dr. GafUell fays) is in the crown, in right of the duchy of 
Lane after. 

There is a fchool in this parifh, to which Jofeph Hudlefton of Milium caftle 
gave ico/, the intereft whereof is paid to the ichoolmafter, by the churchjury, 
by whom he is choien. 

In 1722 it was certified, that they had then a poor flock of 30/ 2 s od given 
by feveral peribns not known *. 

Upon the north fide of Milium-, vip the river of Dudden, lies Ulpha or 
Ouffa, among the rocky hills ; which was granted, as is before mentioned, to 
Ulje^ who gave name to the place. In whofe pofterity it continued for feveral 
deferents, till at length it did revert to the lords of Milium, who have the lands 
and park there in demefne, of a confiderable yearly value; and having been 
formerly an intire manor of itfelf, when in the poffeflion of JJlfe and his pofte- 
rity, was again made parcel of the manor of Milium ; and was fold fome few 
years ago by Sir Hedworth Williamfon to the prefent owner Mr. William Single- 
ton of Drigg. 

The lower part of Ulpha is very woody and good land, the upper part more 
rocky and barren. 

The chapel was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 5 / 
yearly value, whereof 3/ 6s Sd was ancient chapel falary. The chapelry is 
reckoned a third part of the parifh of Milium. The chapel is diflant about 
feven miles from the parifh church, and the road from thence to the church 
is in fome places very rugged and almoft unpafiable. 

Thwaites is another manor and townfhip within this parifh, flanding upon 
the fame river, and north from Ulpha between Dudden and the mountains. 
Is 1 ear the head whereof was heretofore the ancient feat of the Thwaitefes of 
Ewanrigg, who firft had their name from this place. For it being a ftony and 
mountainous country is not every where fo fit for tillage or meadow; but in 
feveral parts and parcels, as they are marked by nature, differing in form and 
quality of foil, or otherwife inclofed by the inhabitants from the barren wafte 
of the fells, fuch parts or parcels are now and were of old called thwaits y 
fometimes with the addition of their quality, as Brackenthwaite, of brackens 
or fern growing there; Sieveythwaite> of fieves or rufhes; Stonethwaite^ of

rocks; and fuch like: and in general, this word denotes any plain parcel of 
ground, from which the wood had been grubbed up, inclofcd and converted into 
tillage. 

This manor was an ancient fee holden of the lords of Milium. In the 
35 Hen. 3. Eleanor wife of John Boyvil and Michael de Cornee palled the 
fame by fine levied : And in the 16 Ed. 1. John Hudlefton impleaded William 
ion of John Thwaits for 200 acres of pafture there. The gentlemen of this 
family of Thwaites do bear for their arms; Or, a cr6fs Argent, frette 
Gules *. 

The chapel of Thwaites was certified to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty as having no endowment. In 17 15, a new chapel was built at the ex- 
pence of the inhabitants on freehold ground purchafed by them, with a chapel 
yard fenced in ; and afterwards confecrated by bifhop Gaftrell. , In 17 17, John 
Dixon and others of the inhabitants advanced 200/ whereby the queen's bounty 
was procured, and an eftate purchafed therewith in Dent in the county of 
York. The place where the chapel ftands is called Halkhwaites. It is about 
three miles from the parifh church. 

John Wennington gave 30/, and Bernard Benfon 5/, to the poor of this 
chapelry ;. which money is fecured upon two tenements in the neighbourhood. 



PARISH OF WHITCHAM. 

At the weft end of Donerfdale, near the fell of BLickcomb, and oppofire to 
Milium, ftands Whjtcham or Whittingham ; all which, or rnoft part of the 
fame, was holden of Milium, as another fee thereof. And the place took name 
of one Wyche the firft grantee thereof, who lived about the time of king Hen. i . 
His two fons, William and Godfrey, were witneffes to a deed of mortgage of 
Kirkfanton in the reign of king Hen. 2. But the iffue general brought their 
lands into other families about the time of king Henry the third. For then 
one Radulph de Bethom had the land, and in the 6 Ed. 1. he granted eftovers 
to John parfon of Whitcham in his woods there. And in the 9 Ed. 1. Robe;t 
fon of Radulph (or Ralph) de Bethom did warrant lands in Silcroft and Sa- 
tarton in the lordfhip of Millum. But the manors of Silcroft and Whitcham 
were in another family in the 9 Ed. 2. as appears by a fine thereof levied be- 
tween William Corbett and Alicia his wife complainants and John de Corney 
deforciant. 

And this manor of Whitcham is now broken into feveral parcels ; part 
thereof, with a considerable demefne, now belongs to Sir James Lowther, 
which he purchafed from the devifee of Henry Fearon of Calvey â€¢, another part 
belongs to Mr. John Muncafter of Cockermouth ; and part thereof ftill re- 
mains to the lord of Milium.

The church of Whitcham is reflorial, and valued in the king's books at 
8/ 1 5 sod; and was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 
49/ 135 3 d. It was granted by Reyner the fewer to the abbey of St. 
Mary's York. After the diflblution, Hugh Afcue efquire appears to have 
been patron, having prefented a rector in the year 1544. In the year 17 17, 
Mr. Pennington is certified as patron. â€” The rector pays apenfion of 10 s yearly 
to St Bees. 

At Whitcham there is a fchool, which was built at the charge of the inha- 
bitants, and endowed with 16/ a year (as is faid) by one Hodgfon. The 
mafter is nominated by 12 truftees or governors, in purfuance of a decree in 
chancery in the 7. Ja. 2. 

Given to charitable ufes 33/, viz. 3/ by Daniel Mafon, the intereft thereof 
to fix poor widows; 5/ by Robert Crompton rettor, the intereft to the poor

plied to the repairs of the church, and half to the poor. 

PARISH OF WHIT BECK. 

Under the mountain Blackcomb, a mile weft from Whitcham, ftandeth 
Whitbeck. or Whitebeck, which William Morthing gave by fine to the prior 
and convent of Conifheved. Thefe Morthings and alfo the Corbets were an- 
ciently feated in Milium. Their names appear in old evidences in the reigns 
of Henry the third and Edward the fecond, and they were men of good worth 
and quality, as William de Morthing and John de Morthing, William Corbet 
and Ranulph Corbet. Divers of the Corbets feated themfelves in Scotland in 
thofe famous wars of king Ed. 1. where their poiterity remain to this day in 
good repute. 

The church was given by Gamel de Pennington to the priory of Conifhead 
aforefaid, and is now only a perpetual curacy, returned at the yearly value of 
9/ 14J ad; and Mr. Park the impropriator is alfo the patron. 

In the year 1631, Henry Park of Kendal mercer left 400/, the intereft 
whereof to be given yearly to fix poor people, to be chofen upon a vacancy 
by the churchwardens and four of the mod fubftantial men of the parifh, who 
are to be nominated and appointed by the biftiop of Chefter for the time be- 
ing. In 1 722 it was certified that an hofpital was built for the faid poor people, 
and lands bought with the money, which yielded 24/ per annum. 

There was then alfo a poor ftock of 30/, the intereft thereof to be applied 
to the ufe of the poor. 

PARISH OF BOOTLE. 

Next to Whitbeck on the common high ftreet is Both ill or Bootle y which 
liad its name from the beacon on the top of the hill above the town, which 

was 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Bootle.) i; 

was fired upon the difcovery of any fhips upon the Irifh feas which might threaten 
an invafion, by the watchmen who lay in booths by the beacon. And for the 
fupport of this fervice, the charge or payment of Seawake was provided *. 

At Bootle in old time flood a marrfion of the family of the Copelands who 
continued till the reign of Hen. 4. Amongfl whom we find Sir Richard Cope '- 
Ian d knight, father of Alan, father of Richard, who died feifed in the 26 Ed. 1. 
and left his eftate to John his fon, father of another Richard Copeland. They 
bear for their arms-, Or, a bend Sable, on a canton and two bars Gules. 

Bootle is a market town, and though it is at a considerable diftance from any 
other market town, yet it hath but a imall market. 

The church is rectorial, and dedicated to St. Michael. It is valued in the 
king's books at 19/ 1 ys %\d; and was certified in 1717 at 70/ 2 s 2 d. It pays 
4 s penfion to St. Bees. It was given to the abbey of St. Mary's York by 
Godard the Sewer (the fame who is above called Godardus Dapifer, fecond 
lord of Milium). The abbot ani convent prefented to it in 1527, a little 
before the difTolution ; in 1717, Robert Pennington efquire is certified as 
patron. 

They have a {matt febool, built at the charge of the inhabitants, and endowed 
â€¢with the intereft of 200/ given by Mr. Singleton, and of 50/ given by Mr. 
Hutton the rector. The fchoolmafter is nominated by the rector and four or 
five of the parifhioners. 

They have an ancient poor ftock of 20/, the intereft whereof is distributed 
every St. Thomas's day. The benefactor not known. 

Lekelev, now Seaton, was granted to the abbey of Holm Cultram, by 
Gunild daughter of Henry de Boyvili fourth lord of Milium -f- ; whofe grant 
was confirmed by Joan daughter and heir of Adam de Milium, for the health 
of her foul and of the foul of John de Hodlefton her hufband deceafed Â£. And 
here became eftablifhed an houie of Benedictine nuns. 

Henry duke of Lancafter (afterwards king Henry the fourth) by his char- 
ter, fetting forth that the priory of Seaton was fo poor that it could not fuf- 
ficiently maintain the priorefs and nuns, grants to them in aid the hofpital of 
St. Leonard at Lancafter, with power to appoint the chantry prieft to officiate 
in the faid hofpital ||. 

â€¢ In the 7El'z. there was a decree in the Duchy court of Lancafter, for fettling the cuftoms of 
the queen's tenants, late belonging to the abbey of Furnefs : Infer alia â€” It is further oidered and 
decreed, by the find chancellor and council, by the fjli alTent, confent, and agreement of the faid 
cuftomary tenants [in the parifh of Hawklhead], that the faid cuftomiry tenants, their heirs and

!8 ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Bootle.) 

This nunnery was valued at the diflblution at 12 or 13 /a year; and in the

by the fervice of the 20th part of one knight's fee, and the rent of gs 2d to 
be paid yearly into the court of augmentations. Sir Hugh fettled the fame 
upon his wife who was daughter of Sir John Hudlefton, and lhe after his death 
marrying into the Pennington family at Moncafter gave the fame to her younger 
fon William Pennington, in whofe pofterity it ftill continues. 

In the 5 and 6 Ph. and M. Sep. 2. Thomas Reve and Nicholas Pynde of 
London gentlemen purchafed of the crown the faid rent of 9; zd, together 
with divers free rents in Seaton late belonging to the faid priory. 

Munkforce was, as before is mentioned, given by William de Mefchiens 
to Furnefs abbey, and upon the diflblution was granted to the houfe of Mil- 
ium, and by feveral mefne conveyances is now the inheritance of Mr. Edmund 
Gibfon of Whitehaven in this county. 

Scoggerbar is another manor within the parifh of Bootle, lying weft from 
thence by the fea fhore ; and was given by Sir William Hudlefton to his lecond

became heir of the lordlhip of Milium, and reunited Scoggerbar to the faid 
lordfhip. 

PARISH OF CORNEY. 

The parifh and manor of Corney lies three miles north from Bootle. Of 
this place Michael the falconer and his pofterity took furname, for they were 
thereof infeoffed in the reign of king John or king Henry the third â€¢, and by 
marriage of the daughter and heir of Corney the inheritance came to the Pen- 
ningtons of Mulcafter where it yet remains, who are alfo patrons of the 
advowfon. 

Middleton Place is a little hamlet within this parifh and manor, where the 
manor court is held, and hath been fo of old time, and the rather in regard 
the capital mefluage and demefne were here formerly, which gave name to an 
ancient family of the Middletons, and was their habitation, but hath fince 
been broken into tenancies. 

The church is rectorial, dedicated to St. John Baptift ; is valued in the king's 
books at 9/ lys id, and returned to the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
at 22/ 1 1 s lod. It belonged to the abbey of St. Mary's York, who prefented 
to it in 1536, which was a few years before the diflblution. It is a fmall pa- 
rifh, confifting only of 36 tenements.

6d, clear yearly value. In the year 142 1, Sir Richard de Kirkby prefented to 
this rectory, and again in 1425. In 1580, Henry Kirkby prefented. In 160S, 
the prefentation appears to have been in the Penningtons, in whom it ftill 
continues. 

In this parifh there was an ancient poor flock of 20/, unto which Mr. Park 
rtctor of Barton in Norfolk added 80 1> the intereft theieof to be diftributed 
annually.

form cf a long ridge of hills, running in an oblique form, from the foot of 
Efk unto the great and vaft mountains in Efkdale, Wafdale, and Miterdale, 
being in length above two miles, and about half as much in breadth. The 
park is large, well ftored with deer and conies, as it is faid it anciently was 
with wood, but there is not much appearance of it at prefenr. 

Ravenglafs 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DE'RWENT. (Mulcaster.) n ' 

Ravenglafs is a village within this manor, and a market town, lying a mile 
weft from Mulcafter upon the Tea more. The word fignifies a green of ferns, 
from renigb, fern, and glafs t green, derived from the Irifb. King John 
granted to Richard Lucy a yearly fair to be held here on St. George's day 
(April 23d), and a weekly market every Friday, as lord paramount. But the 
faid Richard Lucy the fame year, by fine levied to Alan Pennington, con- 
firmed to him as mefne lord and his tenants all the land and fee of Raven- 
glafs, to hold to him and his heirs, with eftovers to make fifh garths in the 
river Efk. 

At prefent, the earl of Egremont holds the fair of Ravenglafs on the eve, 
day, and morrow of St. James. On the firft of thele days in the morning, 
the lord's officer, at proclaiming the fair, is attended by the ferjeants of the 
bow of Egremont, with the infignia belonging thereto ; and all the tenants of 
the foreft of Copeland owe a cuftomary fervice to meet the lord's officer ac 
Ravenglafs to proclaim the fair, and abide with him during the continuance 
thereof j and for fuftentation of their horfes, they have two fwaiths of grafs 
in the common field of Ravenglafs in a place fet out for that purpofe. On 
the third day at noon, the earl's officer diicharges the fair by proclamation ; 
immediately whereupon the Penningtons and' their tenants take poireffion 
of the town, and have races and other divertifements during the remainder of 
that day. 

The earl of Egremont hath alfo feveral fifheries upon the rivers of Efk, 
Mite, and Irt â€¢, where are caught great varieties of fea fifh, as well as frefh 
water fifh : Which fisheries are held, in leafe by the Penningtons. 

And in the winter feafon there is fo great plenty of woodcocks (which they 
catch in inares or fpringes) that the tenants are bound by the cuftom of the 
manor to fell them to the lord for pence apiece. 

The church is dedicated to St. Michael. It was wholly appropriated to the 
priory of Conifhead, and upon the diffolution was granted to the lord of the 
manor, who nominates a perpetual curate, whofe flipend was returned at 10/. 
In 1723, it had an augmentation of 200/ by lot. 

Here is a fchool founded by Richard Brookbank, and endowed by him with 
the intereft of 160/. The fchoolmafter is appointed by truftees, who are 
fome of the fubftantial inhabitants. 

There is an ancient poor fiock of 23/; and 12 loaves diftributed every 
Sunday, given by fome of the anceftors of the Penningtons. 

ESKDALE CHAPELRY. 

At the head of Efk river, three miles eaft from Mulcafter, ftands EJkdale 
chapel :n this ward. It is dedicated to Sr. Catherine. It was certified in 
1717 at 9 / â– per annum-, 5/ of which was intereft of ioo/-given by Edward 
Stanley eiquire, then in the hands of John Stanley efquire his ion. The 
chapelry confifts of two villages, Efkdale and Birker, which are divided by 
the river Efk, the latter in the parifh of Milium, the other in the parifh of 

St,.

church. 

About half a mile from the chapel (lands Awjlbwaite, now called Dalegartb, 
which gave name to the ancient family of the Awfthwaites, upon the grant 
thereof made by Arthur Boyvill lord of Milium. And Conftance daughter 
and heir of Thomas de Awfthwaite brought this manor by marriage to 
Nicholas Stanley efquire in king Edward the third's time. His grandfather 
John was a younger brother of William Stanley efquire lord of Stanleigh in 
the Moorlands in Stafford(hire, from whence they took their name. This 
manor continues in the iffue male of the faid Nicholas to this day, the pre- 
fent owner being Edward Stanley efquire. Their arms are i Argent, on a 
bend Azure three (tags heads cabolhed Or. 

This manor lies at the foot of the mountain Hardknot, and contains a vaft 
tracl of mountainous ground, which is reckoned an excellent (heep heath. 

The aforefaid Edward Stanley efquire, who gave 100/ to the chapel, gave 
40/ to the poor â€¢, and there was then 13/ more of ancient poor (lock. 

W A S D A L E. 

Wasdale (Wa(le-dale) at the foot of Copeland fells lies about two miles 
north from Efkdale. Here are two chapels, holden of St. Bees, Nether Waf- 
dale , and IF af dale head or Upper Wafdale. 

Nether Wafdale was certified at 5/ a year, and is above ten miles diftant 
from the parifh church. 

Wafdale head was certified at 3/ a year, and is 14 miles diftant from 
the parilh church. It received an augmentation by lot of 200 /, in the year 
1719. 

Thefe two chapelries, Mr. Denton fays, are parcel of the barony of Egre- 
mont, and make one intire manor-, which was parcel of the third part of 
Egremont, which Thomas Lucy had with his wife Margaret one of the coheirs 
of John Multon the lad baron of Egremont of that name. But at prefent, 
"Wafdale head is underftood to be part of the manor of Eflcdale, and Nether 
Wafdale a diftin<5b manor of itfelf. 

In thefe mountains is a large foreft of deer, which extends as far as Styhead

A mile or two below Wafdale to the fouthward, upon the fouth fide of the 
river Irt, lies the parilh, manor, and town of Irt or Irton, fo named of the 
river Irt. This place gave name to the ancient family of the Irtons, who

He had iflue, 

16. Richard Irton ; who was fheriffof the county in the 22 Hen. 8. This 
Richard in the 35 Hen. 8. is found by inquifition to hold the manor and 
town of Irton of our lord the king as of his caftle of Egremond, by homage 
and fealty and one half-penny free rent and fuit of court at Egremond. He 
held alfo at the fame time Cleter, and a moiety of the manor of Baftinthwaite.

leaving three fons, George, Samuel,, and Edmund ; and three daughters, 
Frances, Elizabeth, and Martha. 

Irton hall is faid to be a good feat in a bad country ; ftanding upon the 
afcent of an hill, with a large profpefl over the weft part of Cumberland 
and the Irifli fea unto the IPje of Man and Galloway in Scotland. This place 
is well fhekered with wood ; and where it is not rocky, the foil is tolerably 
fertile. 1 he demefne is large. The tenants pay cuftomary rent*, arbitrary 
fines, and heriots, with other boons and fervices. 

Santon, 



. ft+ ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Trton.) 

Santon, in this parifh, was in Henry the third's time the inheritance of 
one Alan de Copeland. His capital manfion houie was in the townfhip of 
Bootle. He held of Thomas de Mulcon of GilQand, who held over of the 
lord of Egremont. Afterwards, Alan and Richard his Tons fucceeded him, 
and John and Richard fucceeded them. And in the 22 Ric. 2. Alan fon of 
Richard Copeland held lands there. It is now in the families of Irton and 
Winder; Winder's part was purchafed of Latus, and Latus purchafed of one 
1. an caller. 

In the river Irt the inhabitants at low water gather pearls, and the jewellers 
buy them of the poor people for a trifle, but fell them at a good price. And 
it is faid, that Mr. Thomas Patrickfon late of How in this county, having 
employed divers poor inhabitants to gather thefe pearls, obtained fuch a 
quantity as he fold to the jewellers in London for above 800/. 

The church was appropriated to the nunnery of Seaton or Lekeley, and 
â€¢upon the diffolution thereof granted to the Penningtons lords of Mulcafter, 
who now enjoy the advowfon and tithes. The church is dedicated to St. 
Paul, and was returned to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 
4/ i%s \d. 

Henry Calday gave 100/, the intereft thereof to go to a fchoolmafier when 
a fchool fliould be built. Upon which foundation a fmall fchool hath been 
jeftablifhed. 



PARISH OF DREGG. 

About two miles fouth weft from Irton, between Irt river and the fea, is 
Dregg ; which is the next parifh, and another fee of Egremont. 

The parifh confifts of two hamlets, Dregg and Carleton. 

Dregg had of old time great ftore of oaks growing there, and thereof the 
name Derigh or Dergh fignifying an oak in the Erie or Irifh language was 
attributed to it. It was in the poffeffion of the Eftorevilles, barons of Liddall, 
in king Henry the fecond's time ; whofe patrimony by a daughter came to 
the lord Baldwin Wake in the reign of king Henry the third. Of which 
Baldwin, William fon of Thomas de Gray flock and the lady Adingham de 
Furnefs in the 10 Ed. 1. held a knight's fee between them in Dregg. And 
in the 29 Ed. 1. the abbot of Caldre, Patrick Curwen, and the lady Mar- 
garet Multon held Dregg of John de Grayftock and of John fon of "Robert 
de Harrington, and they held over of John Wake. Afterwards Harrington's 
part came to the Curwens by marriage of the heir general of the Harringtons,, 
and fo continued in the houfe of Workington, until Sir Nicholas Curwen 
fold it to Sir William Pennington of Mulcafter in king James the firfl's time, 
whole poflerity ftiil enjoy it. But the mofl confiderable part of Dregg now 
belongs to the earl of Egremont, and the tenants do fuit and fervice at the 
great court at Egremont. 

Dregg is bounded by the river Irt on the Eafl and South, by the fea on the 
Weft, and by the demefne and manor of Sealcales on the North. 

The

The church is dedicated to St. Peter. It was appropriated either to the 
priory of Coniftiead or the abbey of Calder, but unto which of the two hath 
not appeared to us. Bifhop Gaftrell takes notice, that Anfelm fon of Michael 
de Furnefs gave the chapel of Drog to the priory of Coniftiead, and queries 
whether in the manufcript it might not be mi (taken for the church of Dreg. 
On the other hand, it hath appeared that the abbot of Caldre had part of the 
manor, and it feldom happened when the religious had any thing to do with 
the manor, but they had the advowfon alio. However, it was fo totally 
appropriated, that it is now only a perpetual curacy â€¢, and was certified to the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty at the yearly value of 5/ 6s 8d. Upon 
the diflolution it was granted, to the Curwens, and Sir Nicholas Curwen fold 
it to the Penningtons as before is mentioned, whofe pofterity now enjoy not 
only all the tithes, but alio the demefne and manor. The lord hath here alfo 
a miln, to which the tenants are bound ; and prefcribd to flotfam, jetfam, 
and lagan, and fo it was adjudged upon a trial at bar between Henry carl of 
Northumberland and Sir Nicholas Curwen in queen Elizabeth's time, and 
afterwards a decree in chancery for confirming the faid prescription and 
fecuring that right to the claim of the fea againft the lord paramount.

PARISH OF GOSFORTH. 

Above Dregg two miles north lies the parifh of Gosforth or Gcsford> 
whereof the Gosfords an ancient family in thofe parts took their furname. 
Robert Go-ford, the kit of their houfe, left his lands to be divided among 
five coheirs, viz. Mariot the wife of Alan Caddy, his eldeft daughter-, Ifabel 
wife of Henry Huftock, his fecond daughter-, Johan wife of Adam Gar. h,

In the fecond year of king Edward the third, Sarah the widow of Robert 
Leyburne held Caddy's part, John Pennington held Kirkby's parr, and the

Mr. Robert Copley, fteward to Sir William Pennington for 17 years 
during his minority, and chief bailiff of Copeland forelt to the then earl

Anne's bounty at the clear yearly improved value of 35/, In the 8 Ed. 3. 
William Pennington of Moncafter efquire died feiled of the advowfon of this

letters patent granted the advowfon and right of patronage to Fergus Greyme 
gentleman, his heirs and alligns. And in the 6 Eliz. March 22. there is

Jonhy, of which family and name there are feveral yet remaining. There was 
one Ponfon in the reign of king Stephen and Henry the fir ft. His fon John 
Fitz Ponfon was fined in Henry the fe-cond's time becaufe he wanted pledges. 
Alexander fon of Richard Ponfonby lived about the time of Ed. 2. And 
William in the reign of Ed, 3. And Robert in Richard the fecond's time. 
It was afterwards purchafcd by the Stanleys, in whofe name and family it ftill

The church was given to the priory of Conifhead by John Fitz Ponfon 
afore faid. It was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bouncy at 9/ is\ 
viz. 61 paid by the impropriator, 3 /given by William Cleator for monthly 
fermons, and 2s furplice fees. In 1689, a prefentation from the crown was 
procured to this church as a vicarage, but afterwards revoked, and there was 
none before that in the inftitution books. So that it is only a perpetual 
curacy, and the Stanleys impropriators nominate the curate. It is a fmall 
parifh, confiding only of 24 tenements and two cottages, in which are refluent 
about 20 families. 

In 1717 it was certified that the faid William Cleator abovementioned, who 
was doctor of phyfic, gave by his will 100/ to the minifter for preaching- 12 
fermons every year, till the impropriation fhould be reftored to the church, 
and then to go to a fchool in the parifh. And the executors refufino- 
to pay the money, the minifter fued and recovered it in chancery, with 20/ 
arrears of intereft ; 9/ of this money was then loft, and 43/ thereof' in 
the hands of the churchwardens not difpofed of. The reft was laid out 
in lands.

fo named from the rill or beck falling down from the mountain called Caldfell 
(from its cold fimation) into the dak where the abbey ftands, and thence into 
the Irifh fea. 

This abbey (which was of the Ciftertian order), was founded by Ranulph 
fon of the firft Ranulph de Mefchiens, in the year 113+ -f\ The revenues 
thereof will principally appear from a confirmation thereof by king Henry the

of laws and his heirs, the demefne and fite of the late abbey or manor of 
Calder, and the church, fteeple, and churchyard thereof, and all meiTuages,

There is a large demefne, but a great part of it is a barren and fandy 
foil, excepting what lies near the river, which is very rich and fertile, but 
not woody. 

Above this abbey eaftward frands Caldfel! and Wafdale fells, mounting aloft 
but yielding plenty of pafture for large flocks of fheep.

â€¢f- Appendix, NÂ°. VI. Note, This laft particular, concerning the church of Dereham, was either 
a miflake, or a wrong claim l>y the abbey; for this aivowfon had been given before by Alice de

witfi deer; and is now a very pleafant feat, by the river's fide, within a mile 
of the fea, the land lying in a flat, and a commodious dwell:ng-houfe being 
there built by Darcy Curwen efquire, upon whom the fame was fettled by his 
grandfather Sir Henry Curwen, which Sir Henry received the fame by grant 
from the crown upon the difTolution of chantries. 

St. Bride's church lies half a mile more weftward between Calder beck and 
Beckermouth. It was dedicated to St. Bridget an Irifh faint. It was' 
appropriated to Calder abbey ; and fince the difTolution thereof was 
granred to the Flemings. John Fleming of Rydal efquire gave the fame 
in frank marriage with his daughter to Sir Jordan Crofsland knight, 
whofe daughters and coheirs fold the fame to Richard Patrickfon efquire ; 
and Mr. Henry Todd is now impropriator and patron. It was certified 
at 7/ clear yearly value.. 

PARISH OF ST. JOHN'S. 

A little above St. Bride's lies the manor of (Little) Beckermet, now and 
of old time belonging to the Flemings of Rydal in Weft mor land, who as 
mefne lords between the baron of Egremont and the poffeffors and land, 
tenants of Rotington, Frifington, Arloghden, and Weddikar, did hold them 
as fees of Beckermet, and it feif as demefne of the baron of Egremont 
barony. For it is to be noted, that there are two manors of the name of 
Beckermet ; one called Great Beckermet, in the parifh of St. Bride's, belonging 
to the earl of Egremont; and this other, called Little Beckermet in the parifh 
of St. John's. 

The church of this parifh was given by the Fleming family to the aforefaid 
abbey of Calder, and in the year 1262 was totally appropriated to the faid 
abbey, fo as that the whole revenue thereof was applied to the ufe of that 
hcufe. In the grant of appropriation, it is curious to obferve, upon what 
frivolous pretences fuch appropriations were commonly obtained. The abbot 
and convent in their petition to Godefride archbifhop of York fet forth, that 
although they had the right of patronage in the churches of St. John Baptift 
of Beckermet, and of St. Michael in Arlekden, yet by reafon of the impor- 
tunity of great men, and provifions of the faid benefices, they had not free 
liberty to prefent unto the fame; and therein, where they obliged one great 
man they difobliged many more ; they therefore requeft, that the archbifhop 
would take fuch order therein, as may be more beneficial to the faid abbot 
and convent, and alio to the archdeacon of Richmond, to whom the fequef- 
tration of, and inftitution to vacant benefices doth belong, and the collation 
thereof for various caufes may appertain : Therefore the faid archbifhop grants 
to the faid abbot and convent, that the church of St. John of Beckermet, 
which is nigh to the houfe of Calder, and contiguous to their parifh of St. 
Bridget, fhall, after the death or cefiion of William the then reclor, be con- 
verted and perpetually remain to their own ufe, for the increafe of their alms, 

and 



3 o ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (St. John's.) 

and better fuftentation of the convent : And that the archdeacon of Rich- 
rcond may not be prejudiced thereby in his right to fequeftrations, inftitutions, 
and collations, he grants in recornpence thereof, that the church of Arlekden, 
after the death or ceffion of Alan the then incumbent, (hall be perpetually 
annexed to the archdeaconry, and converted to the ufe of the archdeacon, fo 
that he may have a houfe in Coupland unto which he may refort, when he or 
his officials go into rhofe parts, through bogs, and floods, and various tem- 
pdts, to difcharge their ecclefialtical function. â€” And the monks in this and 
other like cafes, having obtained the whole pofTefilons, fent out fome of their 
' own body occafionally to officiate in thole neighbouring churches â€¢, and upon 
the diflblution of the religious houfes, thofe revenues being not reftored, the 
churches were thereby left totally deftirute, and to this day are not fupplied 
by rectors or vicars, but only by perpetual curates. And by this means, 
this fame church of St. Johrj's, as well as that of St. Bride's, were fo impo- 
verifhed, that they have ever fince been fupplied by one and the fame curate, 
nominated to both by the fame impropiiator and patron, and are looked upon 
in fact as two parimes united. In bifhop Bridgman's time, they paid fynodals 
and procurations jointly-, but fince that time (by reafon of their poverty, no 
doubt) they have paid nothing. In 1702, a curate was nominated by Richard 
Patrickfon efquire to the churches of St. Bridget's and St. John's. In 1690, 
a curate was licenfed to the cure of the churches or chapels of Beckermond. 

The church of St. John's ftands not far from the mouth of End river. It 
was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 7/. Mr. Henry 
'Todd is the prelent impropriator and patron. 



PARISH OF HALE. 

Hale was fir ft granted to the Multons of Gilfland, with Gosford ; by the 
firil lords of the barony of Egremont : And in the reign of Henry the third 
was the property of Alexander de Hale. Agnes and Conjlo.nce his daughters 
held it in. the 23 Ed. 1. of Thomas de Multon. But in Edward the fecond's 
time the proprietor is named Chrifilan in the inquifkion poji mortem of John de 
Multon. 

The Ponfonbys got Agnes's part, and afterwards the whole. This family 
derive their original from Picardy ; and their prime anceilor in this county, 
accompanying William duke of Normandy in his expedition into this king- 
dom, eftabliihed his refidence here, and took their name de Hale. John 
Ponfonby of Hale efquire, was father of Simon, father of Henry â€¢, which Henry, 
by Dorothy his wife daughter of Mr. Sands of Ilottenden, had two fons 
John and Henry, both of whom fettled in Ireland. For in the year 1649, 
when Oliver Cromwell was appointed to reduce Ireland, thefe two gentlemen 
attended him, with other officers. Sir John Ponfonby, the elder brother, was 
'anceilor to the earl of Befborough ; and Henry, the younger, having lands 
afllgned him in the county of Kerry, had the fame confirmed by patent under 

the

The church of Hale was appropriated to the priory of Conifhead in the year 
1345, by the archdeacon of Richmond, referving to himfelf a penfion of 6/ 
8s a year. It was certified by the lord vifcount Lonfdale the impropriator, 
who was alfo patron, at 7/ a year. It is charged %s \d fynodals, and 6s Ed 
procurations, to be paid by die impropriator. The parifh contains about 
25 families J.

PARISH OF CLEATOR. 

About a mile above, north from Egremont, lies Cleator, being the next 
parifh and town, fevered from Egremont by a little rill or beck called Kekell f 
and fo the parifh was calied Kekell-terr, and by contract ion Cleater. 

So early as the %$ Hen. 8. we find this manor in the hands of the tenants ; 
for on an inquifkion of knights fees in Cumberland in that year, it is found, 
that the free tenants of Cleator held jointly the manor of Cleator of the king 
in capite as of his caftle of Egremont, by the ninth part of one knight's fee, 
rendring homage and fuit of court and \zd feawake. 

The church was fo totally appropriated to the abbey of Calder, that it is 
now only a perpetual curacy. It was dedicated to St. Leonard â€¢, for the licences 
to the curates did anciently run in this form â€” to ferve the cure of fouls in the 
chapel of St. Leonard de Cleator. It was certified to the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty at the clear yearly value of 61 13J 4*/, viz. 4/ 1 3 j 4^ from 
the impropriator, and 2/ penfion from the crown. In 1702, Mr. John Ko- 
bertfon the impropriator nominated the curate. The prefent impropriator and 
patron is John Gale efquire. 

ENNERDALE. 

"Ennerdale or Enderdale is commonly reputed a parifh, although it is only 
a chapel under the mother church of St. Bees, as was found by verdict holden 
at Carlifle in the year 1690. The Irifh named it Lough Eanhelh (lacus volu- 
crum), from the fowls that bred there in the iflands ; and t^e river, Eanheth; 
and the dale, Eaner or Ar-ean â€¢, and the Saxons retaining ftill the Irifh name 
called the bottom and valley Enerdale. 

In one of the charters of the priory of St. Bees (which was a cell of the 
great abbey of St. Mary's York) Ranulph fon of William de Mefchiens grants 
to the laid abbey the lordfhip or manor of Enerdale, yet it was only fome par- 
ticular part thereof, for the manor at large continued in the Mu'ton family, 
and was in the Harrington's part of the divifion of Egremont in the partition 
amongit John de MuLon's coheirs, and defcended to the Bonvils and Greys, 
and by ioffcicupe of Henry father of the lady Jane Grey efcheated to the crown, 
wherein it itili continues. â€” It is a foreft, and was anciently flocked with red 
deer. 

The church or chapel was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
at 4.1 13 s ^ti~ pud by the impropriator. It is diflant about fix miles from the 
pariih ( liurch cf St. Bees.

PARISH OF LAMPLUGH. 

This place was named by the Irifh inhabitants Glan-flough, or Glanfillotigh ; 
whereof is formed this prefent name Lamplugh : which Irifh word fignifies 
the dale-wet (vallis humida). * 

It gave name to the ancient family of the Lamplughs, a race of valorous 
gentlemen (faith Mr. Denton) fucceffively for their worthinefs knighted in t'ie 
field, all or moft part of them. The firlr. lord of Lamplugh that we read of 
was William de Lancajler baron of Kendal, who exchanged Workington and 
Lamplough with Gofpatric fon of Orme lord of Seaton beneath Derwent for 
Middleton in Lonfdale. Gofpatric held it all his time; but after his death, 
Thomas fon of Gofpatric gave it to Robert de Lamplugh and his heirs, paying 
yearly a pair of gilt fpurs to the lords of Workington. This Robert held it 
in Henry the fecond's time-, and is firft in the pedigree of this family certified

The Arms of Lamplugh are; Or, a crofs fleury Sable. 

The demefne of Lamplugh is very large, but hilly ; the foil is partly clay, 
and other parts are better foil, covering a limeftone rock. Here are large 
herdwicks and ftieep heaths upon the mountains. 

From hence there is a large profpec"l over the weft part of Cumberland, the 
Ifte of Man, a great part of the Irifh fea, and of the fhires of Galloway, 
Carrick, Clidfdale, Nithfdale, and Annandale in Scotland. 

Kelton, KeteVs town, in this parifti, was parcel of Lamplugh, and firft 
feparated from it by Kelel fon of Eldred fon of Ivo de Talebois firft baron of 
Kendal. Which Ketel, evidently, gave name to the place. It was holden as 
a fee of Beckermet, as Beckermet was holden of Egremont. 

Salter, the capital meffuage or demefne there, was afterwards given by Gof- 
patric fon of Orme fon of the faid Ketel to the abbey of St. Mary's York, 
and the abbots made it a part of the cell of St. Bees.

Rut Kelton continued always a lay fee, and being in the Harrington divifion 
of the Multon eft/ate, it came by an heirefs from them to the Bonvills, from 
them to the Greys, and by the attainder of Henry Grey marquis of Dorfet 
and duke of Suffolk (father of the lady Jane Grey) it was, amongft his other 
poffeffions, forfeited to the crown. 

In the 3 and 4 Ph. and M. June 25, the faid king and queen grant to Chrif- 
topher Morys (called, by Mr. Denton, Moorhoufe) and Elizabeth his wife 
(who was laundrefs to queen Mary) and the heirs of their bodies, the manor 
of Kelton with the appurtenances, then efcheated to the crown by the at- 
tainder of Henry late duke of Suffolk ; together with all and Angular houfes, 
buildings, barns, {tables, dovecotes, gardens, orchards, lands, tenements, 
meadows, paftures, rents, reverfions, fervices, and hereditaments whatfoever 
in Kelton aforefaid, and a yearly rent of the premifes of 12/ 18 s 6d\ Except-

and windows), and all advowfons belonging to the fame. â€” And the lay fee 
thereof was in Mr. Denton's time in the poffeffion of a grandchild of the faid 
Moorhoufe. 

But Dr. Leigh (Mr. Denton fays) purchafed what belonged to the abbey, 
which was fold by Henry Leigh, fon of Thomas, fon of William, brother and 
heir of the faid Dr. Leigh, to Thomas Salkeld, younger fon of the Salkelds of 
Whitehall ; who gave the fame in marriage with Catherine his eldeft daughter 
and coheir to Jofeph Patrickfon of How before mentioned ; who fold the fame 
to Sir John Lowther baronet. 

Murton, Moor-town, lies a mile weftward from Lamplugh, and was an- 
ciently the poffeffion of a family who received their furname from thence. 
Gerard, Roger, and Alan de Morton, grandfather, father, and fon, fuccef- 
fively held the fame, with ample privileges. In the reign of Ed. 2. Sir John 
Lamplugh held the fame, in whofe name and family it hath continued ever 
fince. â€” It is held immediately of Egremont. 

The church of Lamplugh is rectorial. It is valued in the king's books at 
10/ 4J yd; and is now worth upwards of 100/ a year. The patronage is in 
the Lamplugh family lords of the manor.

Arlochden (Ar-flogh-den)y in the original Erfe or Irifh, fignifies a place at

Egremont, and was given, together with Frifington, Rotington, Weddiker, 
and other places thereabouts, by William de Melchines to Michael le Fleming 
knight, anceftor of the prefent Sir Michael le Fleming of Rydal baronet.

to the governors of queen Anne's bounry at t lie clear yearly value of 10/. 
The bifhop of Chetler is impropriator and patron, 

Frisington, in this parifh, is a fee of Beckermet, holden of the Flemings 
as aforelaid. It lies a mile weft from Arlecden, and was anciently a gentle- 
man's feat of that name, whofe heir male in Henry the fourth's time left three 
daughters coheirs ; Johanna wire of Richard Sackficld, Agnes wife of John 
Lawlbn, and Margaret wife of John Atkinfon : Who Joid it to William Leigh,

PARISH OF ST. BEES. 

St Bees had its name from Bega, an holy woman from Ireland, who is faid 
to have founded here, about the year of our lord 650, a fmall monaftery, 
where afterwards a chunh wa built in memory of her*. 

The name Begoth is Britifh, derived of two words beg og, that is, by our 
E n o 1 i fh interpretations little-young; whereupon the church was full, and is ftill 
in fome ancient evidences called Kirkby Begock, or Begoth. 

1 he aforefiid religious houfe, bein^ dcilroycd by the Danes, was reftored by 
William de Mefchiens fon of Ranulph and brother of Ranulph de Mefchiens

other particulars) the manor, rectory, and cell of St, Bees, with all its rights, 
members, and appurtenances, and all the poffeflions belonging to the fame in

And in the 4 and 5 P. and Mar. the king and queen grant to Cuthbert bi- 
fhop of Chefter and his fucceflbrs the faid yearly rent, paying thereout to the 
crown yearly 43 / 8 s \d. 

After Sir Thomas Chaloner, we find the manor and rectory in the hands of 
the Wyberghs, a very ancient family at St. Bees, who came to Clifton in Weft- 
morland by marriage of the heirefs there. And being great fufferers in the 
civil wars in the reign of king Charles the firft, they mortgaged St. Bees to 
the Lowther family, and on a fuit inftituted by Sir John Lowther of White- 
haven the equity of redemption was foreclofed, and the eftate decreed in chan-' 
eery to him and his heirs in the year 1663, in which name and family it ftill 
continues.

Whitehaven Is a creek in the fea, at the nprth-eaft end of the Bergh or 
rifing hill there, about a mile north from Rotington. It is wafhed by the flood 
on the weft fide thereof; where is a great rock of hard white (tone, which 
gave name to $he place. It was fo inconfiderable in Camden's time, that he 
doth nof fo much as mention it in his Britannia. 

In the year 1566, as appears by a furvey of the (hipping and trade of the 
county of Cumberland (taken by virtue of a commiffion under the great feal) 
there were but fix houfes, and no (hipping (ave one (cnali pickard of eight or 
nir^e ton, at Whitehaven ; and only one of ten ton in the whoje county ; noj 
mariners, except a few, fi^ermen* nothing exported, befides a fmall quantity 
of herrings and codfifh â€¢, nor any thing imported but fait. 

In 1582, upon a general mufter of (hips and mariners within the county of 
Cumberland, taken by command of the earl of Lincoln then lord high ad- 
miral, there were only twelve fmall (hips under 80 tun, and manners and fifh- 
ermen 198, in the whole county f. 

Sir Chriftopher Lowther fecond fon of Sir John Lowther of Lowther pur- 
chafed the lands here that had belonged to the priory of St. Bees, and fettled 
at this place, his manfion houfe being at the weft end of the town, at the foot 
of the rock. And he dying in 1644, his fon and heir Sir John Lowther built, a 
new houfe at the fouth-eaft end of the town, called the Flatt â€¢, which hath of 
late been greatly improved, or rather rebuilt, by the prefent owner Sir James 
Lowther of Lowther baronet. 

About the year 1666, king Charles the fecond granted to Sir JohnLovyther 
of Whitehaven all the derelict ground at this place; and in 1678, all the 
lands between the high and low water marks, for two miles northward ; pay- 
ing*a yearly rent to the crown. 

His fon, the late Sir James Lowther baronet, by improvement of the coal 
works, advanced this town to fuch a degree, that he lived to fee about eleven

enjoyed thefe mines), expended in one of them only upwards of half a mil- 
lion fterling. 

The principal entrance into thefe mines for men andhorfes, is by an open- 
ing at the bottom of an hill, through a long pafiage hewn in the rock ; which, 
by a deep defcent, leads down to the loweft vein of coal. The greateft part 
of this defcent is through fpacious galleries, which continually interfect other 
galleries 5 all the coal being cut away except large pillars, which, in deep 
parts of the mine, are three yards high, and about twelve yards fquare ac 
the bafej fuch great ftrength being there required to fupport the ponderous 
roof. 

The mines are funk to the depth of one hundred and thirty fathoms, and 
are extended under the fea to places where there is, above them, fufficienc 
depth of water for fhips of large burden. Thefe are the deepeft coal mines 
that have hitherto been wrought ; and perhaps the miners have not in any other 
part of the globe penetrated to fb great a depth below the furface of the fea ; 
the very deep mines in Hungary, Peru, and elfewhere, being fituated in moun- 
tainous countries, where the furface of the earth is elevated to a great height 
above the level of the ocean. 

There are here three ftrata of coal, which lie at a confiderable diftance one 
above another, and there is a communication by pits between one of thefe pa- 
rallel ftrata and another. But the vein of coal is not always regularly con* 
tinued in the fame inclined plain, but inftead thereof, the miners meet with 
hard rock, which interrupts their further progrefs. At fuch places there feem 
to have been breaks in the earth, from the furface downwards ; one part of the 
earth feeming to have funk down, while the part adjoining hath remained in 
its ancient fituation. In fome of thefe places the earth may have funk ten or 
twenty fathoms or more â€¢, in other places, lefs than one fathom. Thefe breaks, 
the miners call Dykes â€¢, and when they come at one of them, their firft care is 
to difcover whether the ftrata in the part adjoining be higher or lower than, in 
the part where they have been working â€¢, or (to ufe their own terms) whether 
the coal be caft down, or caft up. If it be caft down, they fink a pit to it j 
but if it be caft up to any confiderable height, they are oftentimes obliged, 
with great labour and expence, to carry forward a level or long gallery through 
the rock, until they again arrive at the ftratum of coal. 

Thofe who have the direction of thefe deep and extenfive works, are obliged 
with great art and care to keep them continually ventilated with perpetual 
currents of frefh air ; which afford the miners a conftant fupply of that vital 
fluid, 'and expel out of the mines damps and other noxious exhalations, to- 
gether with fuch other burnt and foul air, as is become poifonous and unfit 
for refpiration. 

In the deferted works, which are not ventilated with perpetual currents of 
frefa air, large quantities of thefe damps are frequently collected j and, in fuch 

works, 



ALL ER DALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Whitehaven.) 45 

works, they often remain for a long time, without doing any mifchief. But 
when, by fome accident, they are fet on fire, they then produce dreadful ex- 
plofions, very destructive to the miners ; and burfting out of the pits with great 
impetuofity, like the fiery eruptions frombuming mountains, force along with 
them ponderous bodies to a great height in the air. 

The coal in thefe mines hath feveral times been fet on fire by the fulminat- 
ing damp, and hath continued burning for many months ; until large Dreams 
of water were conducted into the mines, and fuffered to fill thofe parts where 
the coal was on fire. By v fuch fires, feveral collieries have been entirely de- 
stroyed ; of which there are inftances near Newcaftle, and in other parts of 
England, and in the. fhire of Fife in Scotland; in fome. of which places, the 
fire has continued burning for .ages. 

In order to prevent, as much as pofllble, the collieries from being filled with â–  
thole pernicious damps, it has been found necefTary carefully to fearch for thofe 
crevices in the. coal, from whence they iffue out ; and at thofe places, to con- 
fine them within a narrow fpace; and from thofe narrow fpaces in which they 
are confined, to conduct: them through long pipes into the open air; where 
beingfet on fire, they confume in perpetual flames, as they continually arife out 
of the earth. 

The late Mr. Spedding, who was the great engineer of thefe works, having 
obferved that the fulminating damp could. only be kindled by flame, and that 
it was not liable to be fet on fire by red hot iron, nor by the fparks produced by 
the collifion of flint and fteel, invented a machine, in which while a fteel 
wheel' is turned round with a very rapid motion, and flints are applied thereto, 
great plenty of fiery fparks are emitted, that afford the miners fuch a light as 
enables them to carry on their work in clofe places, where the flame of a candle^ 
or lamp, would occafion dreadful explofions. Without fome invention of this 
fort, the working of thefe. mines, fo greatly annoyed with thefe inflammable 
damps, would long ago have been impracticable. 

But not fo many mines have been ruined by fire as by inundations. And 
here that noble invention the fire-engine difplays its beneficial effects. It ap- 
pears,, from pretty exact calculations,- that it would require about 550 men, 
or a power equal to that of 1 10 horfes, to work the pumps of one of the largeft 
fire-engines now in ufe (the diameter of whofe cylinder is feventy inches), and 
thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this.fize constantly at work : 
And that as much water may be raifed by an engine of this fize kept conftantly 
at work, as can bedrawn up by 2520 men with rollers and buckets, after the 
manner now daily practifed in many mines-, or as much as can be born up on 
the fhoulders of twice that number of men, as is faid to be done in fome of 
the mines of Peru. â€” So great is the power of the elaftic fleam of the boiling 
water in thofe engines, and of the outward atmofphere, which by their alternate 
actions give force and motion to the beam of this engine, and by it to the 
pump rods, which elevate the water through tubes, and difcharge it out of. the 
mine. 

There are four fire engines belonging to this colliery, which, when all at 
work, difcharge from it about 1228 gallons every minute, at thirteen ftrbkts-, , 

and 



tf AL LERD ALE ABOVE DER WENT. (Wh.itehaye?.) 

and after the fame rate 1,768,320 gallons every twenty-four hours. By the 
four engines here employed, nearly twice the above mentioned quantity of 
water might be difcharged from mines that are not above fixty or feventy fa- 
thoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newcaftle collieries, or in 
any of the Englifh collieries, thofe of Whitehaven excepted *. 

In 1693, there was a little old cbapel, which was pulled down, and a large 
fpacious chapel was erected in the place of it by Sir John Lowther and the in- 
habitants, which was confecrated in that year, and dedicated to St. Nicholas* 
and in the petition for confecration it was fet forth, that formerly it had been 
an inconfiderable village, but by the coal trade was then become fo populous, 
that about 268 families were to be accommodated with feats in the chapel. It 
was certified at about 60 1 a year j 40/ of which did arife from feats by agree- 
ment with the inhabitants when the chapel was built, and the reft by contri- 
bution. When the curacy is vacant, the perfons who have intereft in the feats 
chufe two, out of whom the lord of the manor nominates one to the bifhop 
to be licenfed. 

In 1715, another chapel was built by James Lowther efquire and other of 
the inhabitants on ground given by Mr. Lowther, and dedicated to the holy 
Trinity -, and then it was reprefented that 800 families reforted to thofe chapels. 
This alfo was certified at about 60/ a year j 40/ whereof was to arife from the 
feats by agreement before the confecration, the reit by contribution. The cu- 
rate is nominated alternately, by the lord of the manor one turn, and the per- 
fons interested in the feats another. 

In 1753, another chapel was erected, full as large and handfome as either of 
rthe other two. It is dedicated to St. James ; and has the like endowment. But 
the lord of the manor folely has the nomination of the curate. 

At prefent there are in the town about 2200 families. 

Hensingham is the next village in this parifh, lying eaft from Whitehaven. 
It is now a manor of Sir James Lowther baronet. In the 4 Ed. 1. one Robert 
de Branthwaite held a moiety thereof of Adam de Morefby, together with the 
manor of Branthwaite, by the payment of one penny yearly for all fervices. 
It defcended from the Branthwaites to the lords of Little Bampton ; from them 
to the Skeltons, who married a coheir of Thomas Whitrig lord of Little 
Bampton aforefaid. At the conqueft one Gillefby, Gilby, or Gillfbueth, held 
the fame j whofe fons Roger and William granted to the abbot of St. Mary's 
York two bovates in Henfingham and the land of Snartheved. The tenants

Befides the chapels of Whitehaven, there are five other chapels of eafe, in 
diftant parts of this extenfive parifti of St. Bees ; namely, thofe of Ennerdale, 
EJkdale, Nether Wafdale, Wajdalehead, and Low/water. The four firft of which 
we have treated of already, together with the neighbouring places thereabouts : 
And Low/water will fall in properly, when we come unto the parts adjoining 
to it. Some of thefe are commonly looked upon as diftinct parifh churches, 
though they are in reality no more than chapels of eafe ; and there is an order 
in bifhop Bridgman's time, in the year 1622, by which the inhabitants of all 
thefe five chapelries are injoined to contribute to the repairs of the mother 
church of St. Bees. 

PARISH OF MORESBY. 

Moresby lies about a mile north from Whitehaven, upon the coaft. This, 
being the utmoft limit of the Roman empire in this part, appears by heaps of 
rubbifh all along to have been fortified wherever there was eafy landing. For 
the Scots from Ireland greatly infefted thefe parts. Mr. Camden, fpeaking of 
Morefby, fays, there are many remains of antiquity about it, in the vaults 
and foundations of buildings â€¢, feveral caverns, which they call Picls holes, and 
feveral pieces of ftone dug up with infcriptions. Upon one of which was 
LVCIVS SEVERINVS ORDINATVS-, upon another COH. VIJ. And 
in the year 1607, he faw an altar dug up there with a little horned image of 
Silvanus, and this infcription: 

DEO SILVANO 

COH. II. LINGONVM 

CVI PRIEST 

G. POMPEIVS M. 

SATVRNINVS. 

And there was another fragment of a Roman infcription fent to him by Mr, 
Fletcher then lord of the place â€¢, containing thefe words â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ cb profperi- 
tatem cuhninis inftitnti. 

And Mr. Horfeley found there two imperfect fepulchral infcriptions : And 
in his eflay on the Notitia, he fays-, " Arbeia appears to me to have been the 
" moft northerly of the (lations, which were next to thofe per lineam valli : 
" for after mention of the ftations garriloned by horie, which were in the fouth- 
" em part of Yorkfhire, the Notitia fets down thofe which were garriloned by 
" feveral numeri â€¢, and of thefe, Arbeia is the firft. Camden, from affinity of 
" names, took this for Ireby in Cumberland ; but as there are no remains of a 
14 ftation at Ireby, fo I could never learn upon inquiry, that there were any 
** other Roman antiquities ever found there : and the argument from affinity of 
** names is of lefs force, becaufe there is another place of the fame name in 
â€¢* Lancafhire. Harbybrozv, or Harby -burgh, by the name might bid as fair at 
â€ž lea ft,

â– ** leaft, as Ireby, from which it is diftant about two or three miles; but I 
" found the fame objections lie againft that. I met with the like difappoint- 
" ment at Workington, where fome have faid, that there mud have been a 
Â« Roman ftation; for I could difcover no appearance of it, nor hear of any 
" Roman coins, infcriptions, or other antiquities found thereabout : The ba- 
" rough walls, where the ftation is fuppofed to have been, is about a mile 
" from the town, and not much lefs from the river, but on the oppofue fide: 
" A good part of the walls are yet (landing ; by which it appears to have been 
tc only one of thofe old towns, which we fo frequently fee in the north, and 
V which fometimes bear the name of Burgh or Brugh : I faw no appearance of 
" a ditch, no remains of other buildings about it, or near it â€¢, and in fhort, no- 
" thing that looked like a Roman ftation or town : If it has ever been a Ro- 
Ci man fort of any kind, I think it muft only have been one of thofe fmall ex- 

-" ploratory caftella, which fome obferve to have been placed along the coaft: 
" It has a large profpecl: into the fea, but little towards the land. At More/by 
" I met with evident proofs, though little remains, of a ftation. In a field 
" which lies between that town and Parton, called the Crofts, they continually 
" . plow up ftones and cement, which have all the ufual appearance of being 
" Roman; and befides the Roman infcriptions mentioned in Camden, I faw 
" two other monuments of that nature myfelf ; yet it is not eafy now to dif- 
" cern the limits of the ftation. The field in which the ftones are now plowed 
" up, looked to me rather like the place of the town, than the ftation. There 
" appeared, as I thought, fomewhat like two fides of a fort near the church. 
" Perhaps the ftation, or part of it, has been deftroyed, or warned away by 
" the fea, towards which there is a very large profpecl. The order, in which 
" Arbeia is mentioned in the Notitia, fuits very well with the fuppofition that 
" this is the place ; for More/by is nine or ten computed miles from Elenborough, 
" which ftation I take to be the laft of thofe contained under the title per lineam 
" ralli. 1 he remains indeed are not fo large and confpicuous, as might be 
" expected in a Nctitia ftation; but thofe have different degrees as well as 
" others. According to the Nctitia 9 the Numerus Barcariorum Tigritenfmm 
" were in garrifon at Arbeia -f-." 

Morefby had its prefent name from one Moris a Welchman or Briton, who 
was fettled here in king William Rufus's time. Tor of old time men gave 
names to their houfes and villages where they planted colonies; as Gamelfby 
of Gamel, Ormefby of Orme, Morifby of Moris, and the like. So in pro- 
cefs of time this place gave name to its owners the Morefbys ; the eldeft of 
whom, called Ucknard, gave common in Morifby to the abbot of Holm 
Cultram. 

This eftate continued in the family of the Morifbys for many generations, 
till the male line ended in Sir Chrijlopher Morieeby knight, who had adaughtet 
and heir Anne married to Sir James Pickering of Killington in Weftmorland 
knight; who had a daughter Anne, heir both to the Morieeby and Pickering 
eftates, who was thrice married, firft, to Sir Francis Weftby; fecondly, to Sir

Henry Knevett; and thirdly, to John Vaughan efquire. Accordingly, in the 
$5 Hen. 8. on an inquifition of knights fees in Cumberland, it is found, that 
Henry Knevett and Anne his wife, in right of the faid Anne, held the manor of 
Morefby with the appurtenances of the king as of his caftle of Egremont, by 
knights fervice, rendring for the fame yearly 52s yd cornage. 

In the 19 Eliz. the lady Anne being yet living, the manor of Morefby was 
fold by Thomas Knevett efquire (probably her fon by the faid Sir Henry Knevett) 
to William Fletcher of Cockermouth gentleman, of an elder branch of the 
Fletchers of Hutton. Which William had a fon and heir Henry Fletcher of 
Morefby eiquire ; who had a fon William who died unmarried, and was fucceeded 
-by his brother Henry Fletcher of Morefby efquire, who had a fon William, who 
had a fon Thomas Fletcher of Morefby efquire, who came to Hutton by the 
gift of Sir Henry Fletcher baronet. From him it came to the Broughams ; 
and from the Broughams to the late Sir James Lowther of Whitehaven ba- 
ronet ; and from him to the preient owner Sir James Lowther of Lowther 
baronet. The demefne is large and woody ; and rich in coal mines, for the 
exportation of which the little harbour of Parton aforefaid is very convenient. 

The church is rectorial, dedicated to St. Bridget. It is valued in the king's 
books at 61 2s 37*/, and was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
at 23 /clear yearly value; viz. tithe corn 12/, glebe 2/, modus for hay tithe 
2/ ioj, wool and lamb 1 /, prefcription for the tithes of the demefne lands of 
Morefby hall 4/, other fmall tithes and Eafter offerings 1/, furplice fees 10/. 
The patronage is in the lord of the manor, 

PARISH OF DISTINGTON. 

Distington lies between Morefby and Harrington, a mile or more eafl from 
Morefby. It was the inheritance of Gilbert fon of Gilbert de Dundraw, who 
was fon of Odard de Logis lord of Wigton. He lived in the tim2 of king 
Richard the firft and king John. He was lord of Diftington, Dundraw, and 
Crofton. He gave lands in Diftington and Crofton to the abbot of Holme and 
priory of Carlifle. 

He had iffue a daughter IfoUa, married to Adam de Tinevwuth. They gave 
the fourth part of Diftington, and the advowfon of the rectory, to Thomas fon 
of Lambert de Multon, in the 42 Hen. 3. He had iffue alio another daughter 
Ada, married to Stephen de Crofton; who gave their part of Diftington to Tho- 
mas de Morejly and Margaret his wife in the 6 Ed. 1. 

Which Margaret exchanged it with her brother Thomas Lucy for lands in 
Thackthwaite. And Thomas again exchanged Diftington with the Morejbys, 
for Bnckenthwait in Lowefwater. After that, we find it in the name and fa- 
mily of Dykes. In the 2 Ric. 3. 1484, William Dykes efquire prefented a rector 
to be inftituted to the church of Diftington. In the 35 Hen. 8. Thomas Dykes 
is found by inquifition to hold then the manor of Diftington of the king as of 
his caftle of Egremont, by homage and fealty, fuit of court, 10 s cornage, 
nd feawake, and puture of the ferjeants. In the 4 P. and M. Leonard Dykes 
efquire prefented to the vacant rectory. Finally, after feveral mefne convey- 

Vol. II. H ances,

ances, this manor was at Iaft purchafed by the late Sir James Lowther, and from 
him came to the prefcnt Sir James Lowther baroner. 

Hajes caftle is the capital mefluage belonging to this manor, (landing a little 
below the town weftward. It belonged to the Morefbys, and is now the pro- 
perty of Mr. John Hartley, merchant in Whitehaven. 

The de.mefr,e is large and woody, being a fertile clay foil; and well flored 
with coal. And the tenants have large common right and turbary on Whilli- 
moor. 

The church is rectorial, and valued in the king's books at 7/ \so\d. It 
was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 67/195 2d: viz. 
houfe, garden, churchyard, and glebe 25/; tithe corn of Diftington 16/5J; 
of Gilgarren and Stubfkills 13/; of the outfide of Smith's gill 5/; wool and 
lamb 3/-, pref ription for hay and hemp 4/; Eafter dues and furplice fees 
2/ 105. â€” Deductions: tenths and acquittance 14s ^d; fynodals and acquit- 
tance is $d. â€” It is now worth upwards of 100/ a year. â€” The patron is the 
lord of the manor, Sir James Lowther baronet. 

PARISH OF HARRINGTON. 

Har Â«ington, Haveringtcm, lies between Diftington and Workington, aboutr 
two miles diftant from each of them, being north-weft from Diftington. It 
Hands upon the river Wyre, and was at the conqueft or foon after, together with- 
Workington, granted to the Talebois family, barons of Kendal in Weftmorland, 
and was holJen as a fee of Workington. 

This place gave name to the firft of that ancient family of the Harringtons ;, 
of which houfe have fprung divers families, as of Beaumont in this county, of 
Witherflack in Weftmorland, of Aldingham in Lancashire, one in Rutland- 
fhire, and one in Lincolnfhire. 

The firft of this family, lords of Harrington, that we read of, married the 
heirefs of Seaton below Dtrwent, and therefore confirmed Flemingby to the 
abbey of Holm Cultram, but got not the lord of Seaton's lands, for his wife 
died in the life-time of her grandfather Thomas fon of Gofpatrick, and he- 
gave the faid lands to her uncle Fatric de Culwen. 

Afterwards, Robert de Harrington, in the reign of Ed. r. married the heirefs 
of Cancefeld, namely Agnes filter and heir of William, fon of Richard de 
Cancefield, who married Alice lifter and heir of Sir Michael le Flemings fon of 
William, fon of the firft Sir Michael le Fleming of Beckermet knight. 

The faid Robert had a fon and heir John de Harrington knight, who was 
fummoned to parliament among the barons from the 18 Ed. 2. to the 21 Ed. 3. 
in which year he died. 

Robert de Harrington, fon and heir of John, married Elizabeth one of the 
three fillers and coheirs of John de Multon of Egremont, and died before his 
father, leaving a fon and heir, viz. 

John de Harrington, who died in the 37 Ed. 3. and left iftue a fon and 
heir, viz. 

' Sir 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Harrington,) 51 

Sir Robert de Harrington, who received the honour of knighthood at the 
coronation of king Richard the fecond. He married Ifabel daughter and co- 
heir of Sir Nigel Loring knight of the garter-, and by her had iffue, 

Sir John de Harrington knight; who died without iffue in the 5 Hen. 4. And 
was fucceeded by his brother, 

Sir William Harrington knight, who married Margaret daughter of Sir Ro- 
bert Nevil of Hornby knight, and had iffue only a daughter Elizabeth mar- 
ried to William lord Bonvil; by which marriage me carried into that family the 
accumulated eftates of Harrngton, Cancefield, Fleming, a third part of the 
vaft eftate of Multon, and a moiety of that of Loring. 

This William lord Bonvil, who married the heirefs of Harrington, by her left 
ifTue a fon and heir, viz. 

William, commonly called from his mother's name William lord Harrington. 
Pie married Catherine daughter of Richard Nevil earl of Salifbury, and was 
flain at the_batt!e of Wakefield in the 39 Hen. 6. fighting on the part of the 
houfe of York. Which party prevailing foon after, his eftate was not confif- 
cated. He left only a daughter, viz. 

Cecilie, married to Thomas Grey marquis of Dorfet, to whom fhe carried the 
aforeiaid eftate3, with the addition of that of Bonvil. To whom fhe had 
a fon, 

Thomas Grey x marquis of Dorfet-, who married Margaret daughter of Sir 
Robert Wotton, and died in the 22 Hen. 8. leaving irlue a fon and heir, viz. 

Henry Grey marquis of Dorfet, who married Frances eldeft diughter of 
Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk by his wife Mary the French queen. And 
the lady Frances's two brothers dying without ifTue, this Henry her hufbind 
was created duke of Suffolk. By her he had three diughters Jane, Katherine, 
and Miry. The lady Jane Grey the eldeft was proclaim ed queen after the 
death of king Edwa r d the fixth, and foon after beheaded. And her father, 
for countenancing the fiid proclamation, was alfo beheaded, in the fecond year 
of queen Mary ; and all thele great eftates became forfeited to the crown. And 
this is that Henry duke of Suffolk, on whofe attainder we find fomany grants 
from the crown. 

Particularly, with refpec~t to the matter before us king Phd'p and queen 
Mary, by letters patenc bearing date the firft of July in the third and fourth 
years of their reign, grant to Henry Curwen efquire, all that demefne and

demands. 

The demefne is now comprehended within the wall of Workington park y 
and is well reprenifhed with deer, and is a rich pafture for cattle. 

Here is alfo a good colliery, and the prefent owner Henry Curwen efquire 
having made a new quay or wharf at the foot of the river, exports large quan- 
tities of coals to Dublin and other places. 

The church is rectorial, and valued in the king's books at 7/ ys "$\d. lc

Workington, was given by Ketel fon of Eldred fon of Ivo de Talebois to the 
abbey of St. Mary's York. 

After the diflblution, king Henry the eighth by letters patent bearing date 
Aug. 20. in the 36th year of his reign, grants to Robert Brckeljbye and John 
Dyer the advowfon and right of patronage of both the faid churches. To-

PARISH OF WORKINGTON. 

Workington, Wyrekinton, Hands, two miles north from Harrington, 
at the moufh of the river Derwent. Leland faith, that Workington had its 
name from the IVyre, a brook that runs into Derwent at Clifton. It is the 
feat of the ancient family of Curwen, who fetch their defcent from Ivo de 
Talebois who came in with William the Conqueror â€¢, and their furname they 
took from Culwen a place in Galloway in Scotland ; from which family Mr. 
Camden fays he himfelf took his defcent by the mother's fide. The fucceflion 
of which family is as follows : 

1. Ivo de Talebois, brother of Fulk earl of Anjou and king of Jerufalem v 
married Elgiva daughter of Ethelred king of England. He was the firft lord 
of the great barony of Kendal in Weftmorland.

fide, was the fecond baron of Kenda!. His wife's name was Edgitha. 

3. Retell fon of Eldred, third baron of Kendal. His wife's name was 
Chriftiana, as appears from his grant of the church of Morland to the abbey 
of St. Mary's York,, to which grant fhe was a witnefs. His eldeft fon was 
Gilbert^ father of William de Lancaster the firft, father of William de Lancaf- 
ter the fecond, from whom defcended in a direct line the barons of Kendal. 
His fecond fon was Orme., from whom the Curwens are defcended. He had 
alfo a third fon William, witnefs to the aforefaid grant. 

4. Orme, fon of Ketel, married Gunilda fitter of Waldieve firft lord of 
Allerdale, fon of Gofpatric earl of Dunbar. And her brother Waldieve gave 
to Orme with her in frank marriage the manor of Seaton below Derwent 
parcel of the barony of Allerdale, as alfo the towns of Camberton, Craykfo- 
then, and Flemingby. And thereupon Orme became fettled at Seaton â€¢, and

there in his time. 

5. The faid Orme the fon of Ketel had ififue a fon and heir by his wife 
Gunild (the lord Waidieve's filter) whom he named Gofpatric, after the name

To this Gofpatric fon of Orme and his heirs, his coufin german by the 
mother's fide, Alan fecond lord of Allerdale, fon and heir of the faid 
Waldieve, gave high Ireby, which continued the Curwens lands in a younger 
branch till it ended, as many of the reft have done, in daughters. 

The faid Gofpatric fon of Orme was the firft of his houfe that was lord of 
Workington, by an exchange made with William de Lancafter his coufin ger- 
man by the father's fide ; which Gofpatric gave to the faid William, Mid- 
dleton in Weftmorland, in exchange for Lamplugh and Workington in 
Cumberland ; in which exchange, the faid William referved to himfelf and 
his heirs a yearly reni of 6d at Carlifle fair, or a pair of gilt fpurs, and- 
bound Gofpatric and hrs heirs to do homage, and to difcharge his foreign fer- 
vice for the fame, to the barony or caftle of Egremont. 

He had ifiue Thomas, Gilbert, Adam, Orme, and Alexander-,, who took 
their furname (as the manor was in that age) of their father's name, and wer& 
called Thomas fon of Gofpatric, Gilbert fon of Gofpatric, Adarn fon of Gof- 
patric, and fo of the reft. 

Gofpatric their father gave two parts of the fifhing in Derwent to the abbey- 
of Holme Cultram, with the appendices ; except Waytcrofc, which he gave to 
the priory of Carlifle. Which Waytcroft John then prior of Carlifle regranted 
to Thomas fon of Gofpatric and his heirs, to be holden cf the priory freelya.. 
paying yearly ys rent at Pentecoft and Martinmafs. 

6. Thomas fon of Gofpatric, fucceeded his father in the inheritance, and had. 
iiTue Thomas, Patric, and Alan. 

To this Thomas fon of Gofpatric, one Roland fon of Ughtred fon of Fergus 
gave the great lordfhip of Culwen in Galloway ; to which grant the brethren- 
of the faid Thomas, Alexander and Gilbert, and Thomas and William fons 
of the faid Gilbert, are mentioned as witneffes.

The

56 ALLERDALE ABOVE DERVVENT. (Workington.) 

The church is rectorial, valued in the king's books at 23/. $s. and is now 
upwards of 100/ a year. It was given by Ketel fon of Eldred, with two 
carucates of land and a mill there, to the abbey of St. Mary's York. And it 
ftill pays a penfion of 2/ 15 s \d to St. Bees. 

Queen Elizabeth, by letter^ patent, in the 15th year of her reign, granted 
to Parcivill Gunfon gentleman, divers mefifuages, lands, tenements, and 
other hereditaments in Workington, and one rnefTuage in Clifton, late be- 
longing to the monaftery of St. Mary's York. (Which were probably thofe 
fame lands which had been given to the abbey by Ketel. ) 

There 'alio appears to have been a chapel at Workington. For the fame 
queen, in the 17th year of her reign, granted to the faid Parcivill Gunfon 
and John Soukey, three acres of land called Chapel Flatt in Workington, and 
alfo one chapel together with one acre of land there. 

In 1534, the abbot of St. Mary's York prefented to the rectory. In 1544, 
king Henry the eighth granted the advowfon, together with that of Harring- 
ton as aforefaid, to Robert Brocklefby and John Dyer-, who in the fame year 
fold the fame to Thomas Dalfton efquire, and in 1556 John Dalfton efquire 
prefented to the rectory. In 1563, John Dalfton efquire fold the fame 
to Henry Curwen efquire, in whofe name and family it ftill continues. 

King Henry the eighth granted this advowfon to John Bird the firft bifhop 
of Chefter in exchange for divers temporalties j and it was exchanged again 
by queen Mary for Childwall and other places. But it having been granted 
before to Brockelfby and Dyer, it was found that the bifhop had no title. 

Here is a fmall fchool at Workington, which was built (as is faid) by Sir 
Patric Curwen, and endowed by his brother Thomas with a falary of about 
8/ a year. 

Stainburn, a fiony burn or beck, is a townfhip within this parifh, and 
(lands a mile or more eaft from Workington, upon an afcent above Derwent. 
Waldeve, fon of Gofpatric earl of Dunbar, gave this whole vill, confifting of 
three carucates of lajid, to the abbey of St. Mary's York, for the proper ufe 
of the cell of St. Bees. The prior of St. Bees built here a chapel or oratory. 
Afterwards, king Henry the fourth prefented one Robert Hunte to this as a 
free chapel in the gift of the crown. The abbot of St. Mary's York remon- 
ftrated, letting forth the above particulars. And the king, upon inquiry and 
trial, revoked this grant. 

Clifton Magna et Parva are the next townfhips in Workington parifh, 
which make a chapelry. They lie about a mile eaft from Stainburn, upon a 
defcent by the mouth of Marron water, as it falls into Derwent. Thele vil- 
lages took name from a cliff or deep precipice, which hangs over Derwent at 
the mouth of Marron. 

They were given by William de Mefchines to Waldieve fon of Gofpatric 
earl of Dunbar â€¢, and by the heirels of that family came to the Lucys ; from 
them to Benedict Eglesfield, who had a fon Richard Eglesfield, whofe 

daughter 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Workington.) 57 

daughter and heir carried the fame by marriage to Adam de Berdfey, who 
had a fon Nicholas de Berdfey, who had a fon William de Berdfey, which 
William in the 35 Hen. 8. is found by inquifition to hold his mefluage and 
vill of Clifton of the king as of the manor of Dean, by knights fervice, 
rendring for the fame 2 s lod cornage, and ijs \d free rent, and fuit of 
court, homage, and witnefman in the five towns : And he held Kirk Clifton, 
by the fervice of 35 4 d cornage, with fuit of court, witnefman as aforefaid, and 
puture of the ferjeants. â€” And by a daughter and coheir of the faid William 
thefe villages came to the Salkelds of Whitehall, who fold to Sir James 
Lowther baronet. 

The chapel was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 3 / a 
year. But in 1717, it was certified that there was then no maintenance for a 
curate, or any divine fervice performed ; that formerly every family in the 
two hamlets, being about 40 in number, paid 6d each to one that read 
prayers, and taught the children to read, and the rector gave 2/ a year, and 
officiated there every fixth Sunday ; but that thefe payments had then ceafed 
for above 40 years laft paft. 

PARISH OF DEAN. 

The parifh of Dean is about four miles long from north to fouth, 
and three broad from eaft to weft. It adjoins to the parifh of Brigham and 
to Lowfwater on the north and eaft, to Lamplugh and Arlecden on the fouth, 
and to Diftington, Workington, and the chapelry of Clifton on the weft. It 
confifts of the villages of Dean, Dean Scales, Pardfey, Ullock, and Branthwaite, 
with feveral intermediate houfes ; containing in all about 136 families. 

There is plenty of limeftone at Dean, Dean Scales and Pardfey ; quarries 
of white freeftone at Branthwaite, and of red on the common called the Edge ; 
on which common are alfo fome coal pits. And at Branthwaite are pits of 
black ftone called Cat-fcalps, much ufed in the iron furnaces at Clifton and 
Seaton -f-. 

At the fame time that Ranulph de Mefchines gave the barony of Coupland 
or Allerdale above Derwent to his brother "William de Mefchines, who fixed 
his feat at Egremont, he gave the barony of Allerdale below Derwent to 
Waldieve fon of Gofpatric earl of Dunbar, who fixed his feat at Papcaftle, 
and afterwards at Cockermouth. And the faid William de Mefchines gave, of 
his barony of Copeland, to the faid Waldieve, fo much as lies between the 
rivers of Cocker and Derwent, and the five towns of Brigham, Eglesfield, 
Dean (with Branthwaite), Craikfothen, and Clifton (with the hamlets thereof, 
Little Clifton and Stainburn). From Waldieve the fame came by Oclthreda 
the heirefs of that family to William Fitz Duncan, from him to the Lucys, 
and from them to the Percys earls of Northumberland. And the manor of 
Dean continued ' in this family, till Henry Percy the fixth earl of Northum-

berland granted it to his fteward Sir Thomas Wharton knight; in whofe 
family it continued for five generations, which failing in the late duke rif 
Wharton's time, this manor came again by purchafe into the hands or' the 
lord of fcgremont the then duke of Somerfer, and from him to the prefent 
earl of Egrcmont. â€” The cuftomary tenants of this manor pay a ten penny 
fine, by virtue of a decree in chancery. 

The church of Dean is rectorial, dedicated to St. Ofwald ; valued in the 
king's books at J9/3/ l^d-, certified at 74/ 9J, viz. Parfonage houfe, gar- 
den, churchyard and glebe 50/; prefcription for tithe corn, and fmall tithes, 
let for 25/ 10s; furplice fees 1/. Deducl tenths and acquittance il 18 J yd. 
fynodals and acquittance zs Â§d. It is now worth about 150/ a year. 

In 1447, the church being newly built, a commiflion was iffued to the 
bifhop of Dromore to confecrate it. 

In 1426, Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, and lord of the honour 
of Cockermouth, prefented to it. In 1679, Philip lord Wharton prefented a 
re^or to the faid church. The late Philip duke of Wharton granted the 
advowfon to his fteward Matthew Smales efquire ; from whom, after feveral 
mefne conveyances, it came to the prefent incumbent the reverend Miles 
Tarn. 

Here is a Jchool, which was founded by John Fox of London goldfmith, 
and endowed by him with 10/ a year (as certified in 1723) clear value of land 
purchafed with money left by .him to the goldfmiths company, the matter and 
wardens of which are governors, and nominate the (choolmafter. He is com- 
monly recommended by the minifter and iome of the principal inhabitants. 
The fchoolmafter hath alfo the intereft of 61/, which is fecured by the 
churchwardens. 

It was alfo certified at the fame time, that there were legacies given to ths 
poor, to the amount of 49/. 

Branthwaite, or Brand's plain, lies half a mile fouth from Dean, upon 
the Marron â€¢, and is the next townfhip in this parifh. It was granted together 
with Dean by William de Mefchines aforefaid to Waldieve ion of Goipatric 
earl of Dunbar â€¢, and was given by Alan fon of the faid Waldieve in marriage with 
one of his kinfwomen to a perfon who took the name de Branthwaite \ the 
heirefs of which family was married to Skrfton ; which family of Skelton con- 
tinued here for many generations. In the 35 Hen. 8. it was found by inquifi- 
t'ton, that John Skelton held the manor of Branthwaite of the king by knights 
fervice, as of his manor of Dean ; rendring for the fame 24 j comage, fuit 
of court at Dean, homage and fealty, and witnefman within the five towns. 

And at the fame time he held a moiery of the vill of Ullatke of the king 
as of the manor of Dean, by knights fervice, 8-^d cornage, 2 s 8d free rent, 
fervice of witnefman within the five towns, with homage and fealty. â€” And 
John Thompfon held the other moiety by the like fervices. 

The late general Skelton, who died in 1757, deviled Branthwaite by will to 
capta.n Jones j whofe fon Arnoldus Jones efquire (who hath fince taken tie 

name 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Dsan.) 

name of Skelton) y the prefent owner of Branch waite hall, is now an officer in 
the guards. 

The cuftomary tenants of this manor purchafed their eftates to freehold of 
Henry Skelton efquire, having paid eighty years purchafe for their infranchif- 
uienc. The demeihe is worth about 200/ a year. 

Pardsev, Bard's fhaw or wood is another hamlet in this parifh. By the 
aforefaid inquifition of knights fees in Cumberland in the 35 Hen. 8. it is 
found, that Thomas Salkeld of Corkby then held Pardifnow of the king as of 
his manor of Dean, by the fervice of the moiety of one knight's fee, is 8d 
cornage, puture of the ferjeants, Sd free rent, homage and fealty. 

Dean Scales, or Jhields for the cattle of Dean, is another little village 
in this parifh, included in the fame townfhip with Pardfey. It lies about a 
mile fouth eaft from Dean, on the fide of what was formerly a common, 
being a place for fheltering the cattle. The common hath been fince inclofcd, 
and granted into tenancies. 



PARISH OF BRIGHAM. 

Br 1 oh am is the next parifh, which lies eaft and by north from Dean." 
Brigham is another of the five towns within the honour of Cockermouth, 
granted to Waldieve â€¢, who gave it to Dolphin fon of Aleward, together with 
Little Crofby, Applethwait, and Langrigg in frank marriage wirh Matilda 
his filler. And after fome few defcents it fell to coheirs. For in the 40 Hen. 
3. Beatrice de Lowther and 'Thomas de Huthwaite gave their part of the rectory 
of Brigham to Ifabel countefs of Albemarle widow of William de Fortibus the 
third, then lady paramount of Allerdale; who in the 7 Ed. 1 impleaded 
Robert de Tenwith and Alice his wife for the rectory. But afterwards they 
agreed, by fine levied, that the countefs and the heirs of Ifabel wife of Walter 
Twinham daughter of the faid Alke wife of Robert de Tenwith fhould prefent 
by turns. 

In the 8 Ed. 1. Gilbert Huthwaite held a moiety of the manor of Brigham ; 
and after that family, the Swinburns enjoyed that moiety. The other moiety 
defcended from Walter Twinham to Adam Twinham his fon, who died feifed 
thereof in the 35 Ed. 1. And Walter fon of that Adam Twinham granted the 
rectory by fine to John Harcla and his heirs in the 13 Ed. 2. And by the 
attainder of Andrew Harcla earl of Carlifie, the rectory was feifed for the 
king, though Andrew itood feifed only in truft for Henry Harcla fon of the 
faid John. 

But Twinham's moiety of the manor was given to a chantry in the church of 
Brigham, which after the difTolution of chantries came to the Fletchers of 
Morefby, and William Fletcher efquire infranchifed the tenants for 80 years 
purchafe. But the Swinburn tenants are ftill cuftomary, and pay arbitrary 
fines.

6Â© ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Brigham.) 

In the 35 Hen. 8. it is found by inquifition, that John Swynburne then 
held a moiety of the vill of Brigham of the king, as of the honour of Cock- 
ermouth, by knights fervice, 2 s cornage, puture of the ferjeants, and witnef- 
man, with fuit of court at Cockermouth from three weeks to three weeks. 
And that he held alfo the land of Huthwaite by homage and witnefman in 
Darwent fells â€¢, and two inclofures called Dunthwait and Brunthwait by 
the fervice of one pair of gilt fpurs at the feaft of Eafter yearly, with 
homage. 

And that the free chantry of Brigham held the other moiety of the vill of 
Brigham of the king by fealty only. 

The church of Brigham is vicarial, and dedicated to St. Bridget. It is 
valued in the king's books at 20/ 16s ^d; and was returned to the governors 
of queen Anne's bounty at 44/ 15s nd- t viz. Glebe lands 25/; penfion out 
of the rectory 20 / â€¢, furplice fees 2 /. â€” To be deducted, Penfion to the bifhop 
of Chefter 2/; fynodals 4s id. 

This church was appropriated to the collegiate church of Staindrop in the 
diocefe of Durham in the year 1439. In 1544, the mafter or warden, chap- 
lains, and others of the faid college prefented to it. In 1579, the bifhop of 
Carlifle was patron. In 161 8, Sir Richard Fletcher and Mr. Hudfon were 
patrons. The prefent patron and impropriator is Sir James Lowther 
baronet. 

Mrs. Sufanna Fletcher left by will 100/ to the poor-, to be difpofed of as 
the minifter mould think fit. Accordingly the vicar in 1712 diftributed 50/ 
of it j and ordered 50/ to be put out upon bond, and the intereft to be dif- 
pofed of by the churchwardens as the vicar fhall direct. 

Crakesothen is the next townfhip within this parifh. It is another of the 
five towns which was given by William de Mefchines to Waldieve fon of 
Gofpatric earl of Dunbar. 

Eglesfield is the next townfhip, a mile eafl from Crakefothen, and one of 
the faid five towns. This place gave name to the Eglesfields an ancient family 
here, and lords of the manor. Of this family was Robert Eglesfield, rector 
pf Brough in Weftmorland, confeffor to Philippa queen confort of king 
Edward the third, and founder of Queen's college in Oxford. 

[Lowes- water, lacus in val'e vel profundo, comes next in our courfe of 
inveftigation, although it is not in the parifh of Brigham, but a chapelry (as 
is abovementioned) under the mother church of St. Bees. The lake which 
gives name to the place is three miles fouth from Eglesfield, in a deep vale 
invironed with high mountains ; it is two miles broad, and abounds with 
divers forts of fifh, particularly pikes, perches, and (as fome fay) chars. 

This manor was the eftate of Randolph Lindfey, and in Richard the firft's 
time William Lindfey fued out a writ of right againfl Henry Clarke of Ap- 
pleby, the countefs of Albemarle, and Nicholas Eftotevil for Lowefwattr and 
other lands. 9

It was an ancient demefne of Egremont, and by partition between the 
daughters and coheirs of Richard Lucy it fell to the fhare of Alan Multon and 
Alice his wife, as the 20th part of the barony of Egremont. Thomas Multon y 
calling himfelf Lucy after his mother's name, feated himfelf there. He pur- 
chafed Brackenthwaite of the Morefbys in exchange for a moiety of Difting- 
ton, and alfo Thackthwaite of one Agnes Drumbrough wife of Roger 
Lindfey, which he gave to his filler Agnes wife of Thomas Standley, but 
the fame after fome time reverted to the heirs of Lucy ; and the whole de- 
fcended to Maud Lucy, who gave the fame together with the reft of her patrimony 
to her fecond hufband Henry Percy the firft earl of Northumberland of that 
name, in whofe blood and name it continued until Henry the 6th earl gave the 
fame to king Henry the eighth, who fold the premifTes to Richard Robinfon 
clerk, and John Robinfon of London goldfmith fold the fame to Thomas 
Standley efquire j and the daughter and heir of Standley, together with her 
hufband Sir Edward Herbert, fold the fame to Anthony Patrick/on efquire, who 
fold to Gilfred Law/on efquire, uncle of the prefent owner Sir Gil/red Law/on 
baronet- 
Here is no demefne, and the tenants pay only a two-penny fine; for on 
fome difputes arifing about the uncertainty of fines in the reign of king 
James the firft, who fomented thofe difputes throughout both counties, but 
chiefly with an eye to his own particular manors, the lord and tenants agreed, 
by indenture bearing date Oci. 16, 1619, that in confideration of 27 years 
ancient rent then paid to the lord, they fhould afterwards only pay two years 
rent for a fine. 

Lowefwater is commonly reputed a parifh', fometimes it is called a chapelry 
within the parifh of Brigliam â€¢, but it is in reality a chapelry within the parifh 
of St. Bees, though diftant eleven miles from the parifh church ; and pays 
yearly by way of acknowledgment 3 s 8d to St. Bees. And it appears that 
the priory of St. Bees had pofTefiions here, and perhaps they built the chapel. 
After the difTolution of the monafteries, certain of theie pofTefiions were 
granted to William Graye lord Graye of Wilton and John Bannifter efquire; 
and in the 3 Ed. 6. there is a licence to them to alienate unto Richard Robinfon 
clerk a cottage called Kirkftall and two little clofes called Kirkcroft and Mil- 
nehow in Lowefwater, and pafture for 300 fheep on Lowefwater moor, late 
parcel of the pofTefiions of the cell of St. Bees, belonging to the abbey of St. 
Mary's York. In like manner, John Robinfon in the 3 and 4 Ph. and M. 
conveyed the fame by fine to Thomas Stanley efquire. 

This chapel was certified at 4/ 11s; part of it being interefl of money 
given by will of feveral perfons, and the reft made up by the inhabitants : 
which flock was lodged in the hands of twelve inhabitants, who paid the 
curate by turns. It was augmented by lot with 200/ in 1723. 

There was given to the poor of Lowefwater by William Woodvill of 
Carlifie the fura of 50/, the interefl to be distributed yearly on St. Thomas's 
day.] 

LORTON, , 



6 2 ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Lorton.) 

Lorton, or the lower town, lies in a valley, which though it hath the de- 
nomination and all the femblances cf a parifh, yet is only a parochial chapel 
under Brigham. The river Cocker runs through the middle of this village, 
which is parcel of the manor of Derwent fells, lying on the weft fide thereof, 
and holds of the honour of Cockermouth. This is the moft beautiful and 
pleafant, as well as the moft fertile valfe in the whole country, confining of 
fine fields laid out in regular order, variegated with quick rwood hedges, 
wherein alfo is a considerable quantity of timber wood. The mountains alfo 
fuftain large flocks of fheep, to the no fmall profit of the inhabitants. 

This manor was early broken into feveralties. In the 35 Hen. 8. Richard 
Winder held one third part of the vill of Lorton of the king as of his honour 
of Cockermouth, by homage and fealty, 7,s \d free rent, wicnefman in Der- 
went fells, and fuit of court ; William Sandes held another third part -, and 
William Buddlefion the other third : Probably by marriage of, or defcent from, 
coheireffes. 

The dean and chapter of Carlifle have alfo a manor here. And in the reign 
of king Richard the firft, one Kadulphus de Lindefay gave to the church of 
Carlifle lands in Lorton, with a miln there and all its rights and appendages, 
and namely, the milner, his wife, and children. 

Here the dean and chapter fometimes hold courts, to which their tenants in, 
other places in that neighbourhood are amenable, and do their fuit and fervice 
accordingly. The cuftomary tenants pay a four- penny fine upon change of 
tenant by death or alienation \ but the lord never dies. And the tenants are 
intitled to all the wood upon their refpedlive cuftomary eftates. 

The chapel is dedicated to St. Cuthbert ; and was certified at 7/ a year, 
paid by the impropriator. There are four townfhips within the chapelry, viz. 
1. Lorton. 2. Brackenthwaite, two miles from the chapel. 3. Wythop, 
about three miles from the chapel. And, 4. Buttermere, 5 miles from the 
chapel. For which there are four chapelwardens refpe&ively. Two of thefe 
divifions have chapels of their own, namely, Wythop and Buttermere ; and 
hence it is, that Lorton hath been efteemed a parifli, and thefe two chapels of 
eafe within that parifh. But that matter amounts to no more than this ; that 
within the chapelry at large, two other chapels have been eredted for con- 
venience, the boundary of the original chapelry continuing (till the fame : and 
this appears from the chapelwardens being appointed regularly as aforefiid 
from every of the four quarters. â€” The impropriators and patrons were for a 
long time the Fletchers of Hutton ; who fold their right about the year 17^2 
to Sir James Lowther baronet. 

There is a fmall fchool at Lorton, endowed with the intereft of too/ given 
by feveral perfons. The matter to be nominated by four feoffees. 

Brackenthwaite is fituate on the north fide of Lorton fell, having its 

name from the large quantity of brackens or fern that grows there. It 

was part of the pofleffions of the Morejbys as was before mentioned, until 

Thomas Multon, who took the name deLucy, purchafed the fame ; in whofe 

3 family 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Brackenthwaite.) 63 

family it continued till given by the heirefs of that family to the Perries, who 
gave the fame to king henry the eighth. 

From the crown it came to the lord Grey and John Banmfter efquire ; for 
in the 3 Ed. 6. there is a licence to William Graye knight lord Graye of 
Wilton and John Bannijler efquire to alienate to Richard Robinfrn clerk, all the 
feveral pofleffions late in the tenure of Peter Mirehoufe, Thomas fVilkinfon, 
Ckrijltpher Stanger, John Robin/on, John Newton, and John Stubb, and all 
thofe lands called Dalehowes and Thwaite, in Backenthwaite ; Jate parcel of 
the poffeflions of Henry late earl of Northumberland: and all lands, tene- 
ments, rents, reverfions, fervices and hereditaments whatfoever in Bracken* 
thwaite aforelaid, and in the office or collection of the fteward of Bracken- 
thwaite aforelaid. 

There is a like licence in the 4 and 5 Ph and Mary, to John Robin/on to 
alienate the fame to Thomas Stanley efquire. And the Stanleys conveyed to the 
Fijhers, in whole family it remains dilperfed into feveral branches. 

Wythop, Wyth-thorp, fo called from the wyths or willows growing there, 
is one of the ch pelries under Lorton. It was a wafte parcel of Allerdale 
above Derwent, adjoining to b mbleton, only at the e ft end thereof it falls 
down wbh a lleep woody bsnk to the lake or meer of Bafienthwaite, and 
ftands be v\een E mbleton and Thornthwaite. 

Alice lucy fecond daughter and coheir of Richard I ucy and wife to Alan 
Multon iecond fon of Thomas Multon who married the widow of Richard 
lucy, gave Wythorp and Vvhinfell near Lorton, the eighth part of Lorton, 
and vertain corn out of Alpatric miln, and 3 meffuages and 30 a.res of land 
in Caldbeck, unto John Lucy her fe^ond fon whom fhe had to the laid Alan 
Multon \ whom fhe named Lucy, not Multon, becaufe Lucy was the greater 
family -, and for that her elder lifter Amabil who was married to Lambert 
Multon did continue the name and arms of Thomas Multon their father in 
the familv of Egremont, fhe caufed her childien to be called Lucys, and gave 
the Lucy's coat to her pofterity. i>he did referve out of Wytnorp a penny 
rent fervice, or a pair of gloves â€¢, and alter it was inhabited, it was deemed 
worth 10/ a year, and the refidue ab.ut i I lis id, out of which fhe alfo re- 
ferved a rent i'erv ce of 4^' a year. This John Lucy lived in the time of 
Henry the third and Edward the firft, and died in the 8 Ed. 2. or before. 
For Hugh Lowther fon of Hugh Lowther, after the death of the faid John 
Luc>, enjoyed W\ thorp-, and in the 8 Ld. 2. Chriftian the widow of the 
faid John Lucy impleaded him for her dower there. 

It did dekend w U\ti Lowtiiers ulue male or a long time. By the lnquin> 
tion of knights fees aforefaid in the 3 -\ Hen. 8. it is found, that John Low- 
ther knight then he'd the manor of Wuhorppe of the king by the third part 
of one knight's fee as of the honour of Cockermouth, by homage, fealty, 
and fuit of court at Cockermouth from three weeks to three weeks, and the 
free rent of one penny or one red role. 

Afterwards 



6 + ALLERDALE ABOVE DER WENT. (Wythop.) 

Afterwards it was fold by Sir Richard Lowther knight to Thomas Fletcher 
father of Sir Richard Fletcher baronet, in whole pofterity it fttll continues 
under the fervices before mentioned. 

Here is a fmall demefne and ancient houfe called Wythop hall, and divers 
cuftomary tenants who pay arbitrary fines and heriots. 

From this place fouthwards, there is a continued tract of prodigious high 
mountains as far as the Black-comb fell at Milium, and which runs fouth eall 
as far as the barony of Kendal and Fumes. 

The chapel of Wythop was certified at 2/ ys\ part paid by the inhabitants 
out of their eftates by voluntary agreement, and part of it being intereft of 
money given by the will of feveral perfons. 

Buttermere is the other chapelry under Lorton, which was certified at 
1 /, paid by the inhabitants by voluntary affefiment upon their lands. It was 
alfo certified that both this and Wythop were ferved by Readers, except 
that the curate of Lorton officiated at each of them three or four times 
a year. 

This village lies about a mile fouth from Lowefwater, in a low crooked 
deep valley, incompafied with ftupendous mountains. Here are alio two 
great lakes or meers, and in them the char is found, and excellent trout 
little inferior to char. In the hills above thefe lakes fprings the river 
Cocker. 

This diftr'nft, with the lakes, is holden of the earl of Egremont as parcel of 
the manor cf Derwent Fells ; and was granted, as feveral others abovemen- 
tioned, firft to the lord Gray and Banijler^ then to Robin/on, and then to Stanley.. 
In the feveral licences of alienation, the lands are thus defcribed : All the 
lands called Birknesfield or Gatefcath, with the appurtenances in Gatefcath 
and Buttermere Dubbs, late in the tenure of Robert Hudfon, lying and being 
. in Buttermere in the parifh of Brigham, late parcel of the poffefTions. of Henry 
late earl of Northumberland. 

Whinfell, another diftricl: in the parilh of Brigham, lies on the weft fide 
of Lorton fell, and is parcel of the honour of Cockermouth. In the 35 
Hen. 8. it was in the hands of coparceners, namely-, Chnftopher Curwen, 
John Eglesfield, and Ambrofe Middleton, who held the fame (together with 
divers tenements in Setmorthow) of the king as of the honour of Cocker- 
mouth, by knights fervice, 6s 8d cornage, homage and fealty, feawake, and 
puture of the ferjeants. 

It appears to have been afterwards in the Wharton family â€¢, and was fold by 
the truftees of the late duke. of Wharton to the late duke of Somerfet, and is 
now the inheritance of the earl of Egremont. 

Mosergh lies a little higher weft, and is another townfhip in the parifh of 
Brigham. In the 35 Hen. 8. Thomas Salkeld of Corkby held the manor of 
Mofergh of the king as of his caftle of Egremond, by homage and fealty, 

fuit 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Mosergh.) 6 S 

fuit of court, 13 j 4.d cornage, and puture of the ferjeants. It was afterwards 
purchafed to freehold. 

Many of the inhabitants here are quakers, being fo approximate neigh- 
bours to Pardfey Cragg, a moft famous place formerly for quakers, being far 
from any church. 

But before the diffblution of the religious houfes, there feems to have been 
a chantry or chapel here, which was pretty largely endowed ; for king Ed- 
ward the fixth, by letters patent bearing date Dec. 13. in the fecond year of 
his reign, granted to Thomas Brende of London, fcrivener, the chantry of 
Mofer otherwife Mofargh, together with divers mefluages and tenements late 
in the tenure of Henry Robinfon, John Mirehoufe, John Watfon, John 
Williamfon, and Anthony Fletcher in the parilh of Brigham in the county of 
Cumberland, late belonging to the faid chantry ; and alfo, late belonging to 
the faid chantry, one water mill, with all watercourfes, pools, and mill-dams 
in Brigham aforefaid. 

Defcending from Lorton, by Southwaite, in a fertile country, we come to 
Cockermouth, which is another chapelry in the parilh of Brigham. It 
ftands on the mouth of the river Cocker, from whence it deriveth its name. 
The faid river divides the town equally into two parts, fave only that the 
church, market place, and caftle (land all on the eaft fide thereof, more upon 
an afcent -, where, under the weft fide of the caftle wall, the river Derwent 
receives Cocker, and there they make one ftream. Camden defcribes this 
place to be a populous, well traded, market town, neatly built, but of a low 
fituation, between two hills, upon one is the church or chapel, and upon 
the other over againft it (which is evidently artificial) a very ftrong caftle, 
on the gates whereof were the arms of the Multons, Umfranvills, Lucys, 
and Percys. 

This, together with the reft of the Lucy eftate, did Maud filler and heir to 
Anthony Lucy, give to her hufband Henry firft earl of Northumberland ; 
and although (he had no iffue by him, yet made fhe the family of the Percys 
her heirs, on condition they fhould quarter the arms of Lucy. 

The houfes are built of ftone, and flated moftly with blue flate. They 
compofe two ftreets, one above the river Cocker, in which part are the moot- 
hall, market houfe, corn market, and ihambles. And in the other below, is 
the beaft market. 

This borough returned two members to parliament in the 23 Ed. 1. to wit, 
William Bully and Peter de Hall. From which time it was difcontinued till 
the year 1640, when its liberties, together with thofe of Okehampton, Hony- 
ton, Alhburton, Malton, and Northallerton were reftored f. The bailiff is 
the returning officer, and the members of parliament are elected by about 300 
burghers, who hold by burgage tenure J.

The faid bailiff is the head officer in the borough, and is chofen yearly at 
the Michaelmafs court by the leet jury for the year enfuing. He is alfo clerk 
of the market. 

The eftate of the earl of Egremont in this county is managed by commif- 
fioners (whereof the fteward is one), before whom all the cuftomary tenements 
pafs by deed, furrender, and admittance, at their audit in Cockermouth caftle, 
as well for the barony of Wigton and Egremont, as of this honour of Cock- 
ermouth, and the feveral manors of the five towns, Derwent fells, Brathwaite, 
Coldale, Weftdale, Afpatric, Bolton, and Weftward. And all leafes are 
there granted of all demefne lands, mills, mines, profits of fairs and markets ; 
and all rents, fines, and profits are duly paid in there by the bailiffs and 
tenants of the refpective manors. There is alfo an old furvey book kept of 
the bounds of all thofe manors; and of all lands, tenements, farms, mills, 
mines, quarries, rents, cuftoms, duties and fervices, arifing out of or any 
ways belonging to any of them. 

The fteward keeps the courts, and at the court leet holden for this honour, 
all the tenants within the five towns and Derwent fells anfwer ; and there are 
three juries charged, one for the borough, another for the five towns, and a 
third for Derwent fells. 

Of the caftle, no part is habitable but the gatehoufe, and two rooms on 
each floor, where the old liable flood adjoining thereto â€¢, and the court houfe at 
the eaft angle of the caftle wall, where the Chriftmafs feffions was alfo held, 
till the new hall was built. 

The caftle yard hath a bowling green inclofed in it, which is all the land 
that did belong to it. 

The 'park lies on the north eaft fide of the caftle, which arifeth with a gra- 
dual afcent eaftward above a mile to the top of Hay fell, and with a like 
defcent bends northward towards Derwent river. It was long ago difparked, 
and the herbage thereof fold to Sir Thomas Wharton, but is now again by 
purchafe united to the family eftate. 

This caftle was the feat of Waldeof lord of Allerdale and his fucceffors, 
after they had removed from Papcaftle -, and was kept in repair till it was 
made a garrifon in the year 1648 for the king, and being befieged by the par- 
liament forces was by them taken and burnt. 

The weekly markets are held here on Mondays, and a fortnight fair holden 
every other Wednefday from the beginning of May to Michaelmafs for 
the fale of cattle, in the wide ftreet between Cocker and Derwent bridges. 
There are likewife two other fairs holden in the borough yearly on Whitfun 
Monday and Michaelmafs day. 

The chapel was dedicated to All Saints ; for in the 18 Ric. 2. it appears 
from a record in the tower, that Henry Percy earl of Northumberland found- 
ed a chantry in the chapel of All Saints in Cockermouth. And the faid 
chantry was endowed probably with lands in Cockermouth ; for in the 20 
Eliz. there is a grant from the crown to Parcivil Gunfon of two acres of land 
in Cockermouth late in the tenure of Alan Ribton, two acres late in the 

tenure 



ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Cockermouth.) 67 

tenure of William Thompibn, and two acres late in the tenure of Michael 
Bouch, parcel of the poffeffions of the late college of Staindrop in the county 
of Durham (unto which college, or collegiate church, the mother church of 
Brigham was appropriated). 

It was returned to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 34/ 13 s 4^; 
viz. 26/ 13s 4 d paid by the impropriator, furplice fees about 8/. The im- 
propriator (Sir James Lowther baronet) nominates the curate. 

The prefent chapel was built in 171 1, towards defraying the expence 
whereof a charity brief was obtained. The length of it is 1 00 feet, and the 
breadth 45 ; and it is galleried on both fides. 

Here is a free fchool, which in 1717 was certified at 26/ 15 s a year ; viz. 
10/ paid by Mr. Fletcher Vane then impropriator of the church, 5/ by Mrs, 
Fletcher of Tallentire, 5/ by the duke of Somerfet, 5/ rents of houfes in the 
town, 35 s intereft of money. The fchool was founded by Philip lord Whar- 
ton, Sir George Fletcher, Sir Richard Grahme, Dr. Smith dean (afterwards 
bifhop) of Carlifle, and other contributors. 

Hughthwait lies two miles north from hence, being a fmall hamlet in this 
parifh, and a little manor of Mr. John Swinburn's ; whofe great anceftor 
married the daughter and heir of Hughthwaite. 

Seatmoorthow, called in the bifhop of Chefter's regifters Secmurthy, is ano- 
ther village in the parifh of Brigham, lying upon Darwent a mile further eaft. 
The chapel thereof was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 
40 s a year, being the intereft of 40/ raifed by the inhabitants out of their 
eftates for a Reader. 

Embleton, villa Amabilla^ lies fouth from Seat Murthow above two miles, 
in a pleafant fruitful valley, pointing eaft upon the lake of Baflenthwaite, and 
weft towards Cockermouth ; being well inclofed with plenty of wood, efpe- 
cially in the hedge rows â€¢, and girded in by two green hills on the fouth and 
north fides, whence they reap much benefit in fummer by their great flocks 
of fheep. 

In the reign of king Richard the firft, it was parcel of the demefne of Al- 
lerdale â€¢, then Robert Courtney and dame Alice Romley his wife (one of the 
daughters and coheirs of William Fitz Duncan lord of Allerdale ward from 
Dudden to Shalk and Wampool) gave Embleton to Orme de Ireby one of the 
younger fons of Gofpatric fon of Orme, and free common of pafture in 
Dockera and Wythop. This Orme de Ireby was feated at High Ireby which 
Gofpatric his father gave him, of which place his ifitie and pofterity took 
furname. 

This is another chapelry in the parifh of Brigham. The chapel is de- 
dicated to St. Cuthbert. It was certified at 8l 5s per annum, viz. 5/ paid 
by the impropriator, 2/ 4 * rent of land, 1 1 is from ancient ftock in feveral 
hands. 

K 2 PARISH 



68 ALLERDALE ABOVE DERWENT. (Thornthwaite.) 

PARISH OF CROSTHWAITE. 

Having traverfed the large and extenfive parifh of Brigham, we come to 
that part of Crosthwaite parifh which lies within this ward, which is fevered 
from the eaft part of the faid parifh, and from Allerdale ward below Derwent, 
by the lake and river of Derwent, and is part of the manor of Derwent Fells, 
within the honour of Cockermouth. 

Thornthwaite is the firft townfhip, at the head of the broad water of 
Baffenthwaite, and on the eaft fide of Whinlatter a great mountain which in- 
terpofeth between it and Lorton. The tenants here are moftly. cuftomary un- 
der the earl of Egremont, and pay arbitrary fines and heriots, 

Here is a chapel of eafe under Crofthwaite â€¢, the whole endowment whereof, 
as certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty, was 4/ 16s od. The 
vicar of Croftthwaite for the time being has the nomination. 

Portenscale is the next townfhip, a mile eaft nearer Kefwick, belonging 
to Coldale and Brathwaite, parcel of the manor of Derwent Fells, and lies in 
the middle of the valley between Brathwaite and Kefwick. Here are fome 
very confiderable cuftomary eftates ; which, as many others in this ward, pay 
arbitrary fines and heriots. 

Braythwaite is the next townfhip, a mile fouth- weft from the former. The 
tenants here are all cuftomary except one, and pay fines arbitrary. 

Stanger and Stare make the next townfhip, a mile further fouth, upon, 
the weft fide of Derwent lake. Here the late general Stanwicks had a fmall 
freehold eftate, the reft are all cuftomary and pay arbitrary fines. 

Newlands lies yet two miles higher fouth, towards the head of Derwent ; 
where or nigh unto which, were difcovered thofe rich copper mines by Thomas 
Thurlandand Daniel Hetchletter a German of Augiburg in queen Elizabeth's 
time, which occafioned a fuit between the queen and Thomas then earl of 
Northumberland, in whofe lordfhip of Derwent Fells thefe mines were found. 
J3ut in regard of the queen's prerogative, there being in thofe mines more 
gold and filver than copper or lead, they were judged to be due to the queen 
upon the defendant's demurrer in law. In which cafe it was agreed, that where 
the gold and filver, extracted out of the copper or lead, was of greater value 
in quality than the copper or lead, it was then a royal mine *. But by the 
act of parliament 1 W. c, 30. no mine of copper, tin, iron, or lead fhall thence 
after be deemed a royal mine-, provided that all gold or filver that fhall be 
extracted be difpofed of at his majefty's mint within the tower of London. 
And by another act 5 W. c. 6. the owners of mines fhall enjoy them, but the 
king may have the ore of any mine (other than tin ore in the counties of De-

after the ore fhall be raifed and before the fame be removed, the rates follow- 
ing, viz. for copper 16/ a tun, tin and iron 40; a tun, and lead 9/ a tun.-r- 
Theie mines, it is faid, ferved not only all England, but divers places beyond 
fea â€¢, until the fir.eliing houfes and works were deftroyed, and molt of the 
miners flain, in the civil wars: and the works have never fince been managed 
to any account. 

Borrowdale is our lad townfhip in this ward. It was anciently written 
Boredale, having its name probably from the wild boars which ufed in former 
times to haunt the woody part of Weftdule foreft; the hill above it being 
called Styheady where the fwine were wont to feed in the fummer, and fall 
dawn in autumn into this dale, where they fed upon nuts and acorns. 

Here are large flocks of fheep â€¢, and anciently were mines of lead and cop- 
per. Here alfo, in a very high and perpendicular rock, called Eagle crag, is 
every year an airy or neft of eagles. 

This is part of the ancient manor of Castlerigg, the inheritance heretofore 
of the family of Derwentwater, and afterwards of the RadclirTs. 

And here we finifh. the ward of Allerdale above Derwent. The reft of the 
parilh of Crofthwaite lies in the ward of Allerdale below Derwent ; which 
we proceed next to treat of.- 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. 

A T the fame time that Ranulph de Mefchiens gave to his brother William de 
"*~^ Mefchiens the barony of Allerdale above Derwent, afterwards called the 
barony of Egremont ; he gave to Waldieve fon of Gofpatric earl of Dunbar 
in Scotland the barony of Allerdale below Derwent, commonly diftinguifhed 
by the Angle name of the barony of Allerdale, which lieth between the rivers

heir Alice married to this fame William Fitz Duncan nephew to the king of Scot- 
land ; by which marriage fhe alfo brought her paternal inheritance, the honour 
of Skipton, into the fame family. 

This Alice wife of William Fitz Duncan, and daughter as aforefaid of Ro- 
bert de Romley lord of Skipton, in the 1 Hen. 2. transferred the canons of 
Emefey, which her grandmother Cecily wife of William de Mefchiens had

The faid William Fitz Duncan, by his wife Alice de Romley, had a fon 
William, who died young; and three daughters, viz. Cecily, firft married to 
Alexander Fitz Gerald, and afterwards to William le Grojj'e earl of Albemarle, 
to whom fhe brought the honour of Skipton, being her purparty of the inhe-

honour of Egremont as her purparty. The third was Alice, firft married to 
Gilbert Pipard, who had with her Afpatric, with the barony of Allerdale, and 
liberty of Cockermouth ; and afterwards married to Robert de Courtney : but 
fhe died without iffue. Whereby this barony of Allerdale came to her two 
fjfters Cicely and Amabil, or their heirs. 

Cicely the elder of the two fifters, having no iffue to her former hufband 
Alexander Fitz Gerald, was married as aforefaid to her fecond hufband William

But Hawife furviving married again to Baldwin deBetun then earl of the Ifleof 
"Wight. He alfo in her right enjoyed the earldom of Albemarle. He died in 
the 14J0I1. leaving the fame Hawife furviving, who then gave no lefs than 
the fum of 5000 marks to have the pofieflion of her inheritance and dowries. 
She died not long after, and was fucceeded in the fixteenth year of king John 
-by her fon, 

William de Fortibus the fecond; who married Aveline daughter and at 
length coheir to Richard de Munfichet a great baron in Effex. He died upon 
the Mediterranean fea in the 26 Hen. 3. leaving iffue his fon and heir, 

William de Fortibus the third; who, paying 100/ for his relief, had 
livery of his lands. This William was he who made partition with Alice wife 
of Alan de Multon of the forefts of Allerdale, Cockermouth, and Caldbeck. 
In the 41, 42, 43, and part of 44 Hen. 3. he was {heriff of Cumberland. 
To his firft, wife he married Chriftian daughter and coheir of Alan de Galway 
a great man in Scotland, but had no ifiue by her. To his fecond wife he mar- 
ried Ifabel daughter of Baldwin earl of Denby, by whom he had iflTue three 
fons, John, Thomas, and William, and two daughters Avice and Aveline, 
which Avice died young and was buried in the abbey of Meaux.â€” This earl 
died in the 44 Hen. 3. and his three fons not long after; and the only remain- 
ing iffue was 

Aveline, who was married to Edmund fecond fon of king Henry the third, 
commonly called Crouchback, and afterwards earl of Lancafter * ; and died 
without ilTue : whereby Skipton, her anceftor Cicely's purparty, came to the 
crown, and was granted by king Ed. 2. to Robert de Clifford, from whom it 
hath defcer.ded to the prefent owner Sackville earl of Thanet. Her remaining 
{hare of the Fitz Duncan's eftates in Cumberland fell to the heirs of Amabil fe- 
cond daughter and coheir of William Fitz Duncan ; and thereby the two ba- 
ronies became again united.

The faid Amabil, who had Egremont for her purparty, and after the death 
of her f.fter Alice a moiety of Allerdale, was married to Reginald de Lucy. 

Sir William Dugdale fays, that the firft mention he finds of this name is, 
in the render made to Richard de Lucy by king Hen. 1. of the lordlhip of Difce 
in Norfolk ; where the record exprelTeth, that it was not known whether it 
was fo yielded to him as his inheritance or for his fervice Â£. 

In the 20 Hen. 2. this Reginald de Lucy, who married Amabil fecond daughter 
of William Fitz Duncan, upon the rebellion of the earl of Leicefter and others 
on the behalf of young Henry the king's fon, was governor of Nottingham 
for the king. And in the 1 Ric. r . at the coronation of that king, he gave his 
attendance with the reft of the barons. By his faid wife he had a fon and heir, 
viz. Richard de Lucy, who in the 1 Joh. gave to the king a fine of 300 
marks for livery of all his lands in Coupland and Canteberge, and to have 
liberty to marry whom he pleafed, as alfo to have his purparty of thofe lands

whereunto he had claim againft Baldwin earl of Albemarle and Robert de 
Courtney and Alice his wife. 

In the 5 Joh. he gave five marks and one palfrey to the king, that he might 
have jurors to inquire what cuftoms and fervices his tenants had ufed to per- 
form and do to him and his anceftors for their lands in Coupland -, and the 
fame year obtained a grant from the king to himfelf and Ada his wife daughter 
and coheir of Hugh de Morville of the forefterfhip of Cumberland with its 
appurtenances without any partition to be made thereof with Joane her other 
fitter. And the king further granted to them the purparty of her the faid 
Joane in all her father's lands. â€” And in the 15 Joh. the faid Richard de Lucy 
died ; leaving by his faid wife Ada two daughters coheirs, Amabil and Alice, 
between whom the inheritance became again divided. 

His wife Ada furvived him, and in the 15 Joh. fhe paid a fine of 500 marks 
for livery of her paternal inheritance, and alfo for her dowry of her hufband's 
lands. After which fhe took to hufband Thomas de Mult on, without the king's 
licence ; by reafon whereof the caftle of Egremont and other the lands where- 
of (he was poffefied were feized into the king's hands. But afterwards, upon 
compofition made, he had livery of them again. And he obtained the ward- 
Ihip of his wife's two daughters the coheirs of Lucy, and married them to his 
two fons which he had by a former wife ; namely, Amabil the elder filler to 
Lambert de Multon elder of the faid two fons, and Alice the younger fifter to 
Alan de Multon the younger fon. 

Ada the mother had, to this her fecond hufband Thomas de Multon, two 
other children Thomas and Julian -, unto which Thomas the Morvil eftate from 
his mother did defcend, and he married the heirefs of GilQand : which two 
inheritances, after feveral defcents from him in the male line, were carried by 
an heir female into the family of Dacre. The Lucy eftate, by the two inter- 
marriages aforefaid, was transferred into the name and family of Multon. 

The firft of the Multons that Sir William Dugdale* had met with, was 

Thomas de Multon (fo called from his refidence at Multon in Lincoln- 
fhire) ; who in the reign of king Hen. 1. at the funeral of his father in the 
chapter- houfe at Spalding (his mother, brothers, fillers, and friends being 
prefent) gave the church of Wefton to the monks of that abbey. 

After him was Lambert de Multon ; who in the 1 1 Hen. 2. was amerced 
at 100 marks, refiding then in Lincolnfhire. 

After him was Thomas de Multon, of whom we fpeak; who married to 
his fecond wife as aforefaid Ada widow of Richard Lucy. In the 9 and 10 Joh. 
he was Iheriff of Lincolnfhire. In the 15 Joh. he attended the king in his ex- 
pedition into Poictou. And having then given ioco marks to the king for 
the wardfhip of Richard Lucy's two daughters, he beftowed them as afore- 
faid in marriage upon his two fons Lambert and Alan. 

In the 17 Joh. being in arms againft the king with the rebellious barons, 
and taken at Rochefter â– caftle, he was committed to the cuftody of Peter dc

Whereupon he employed his ion Lambert to the king for licence of fafe con- 
duct, on the behalf of himfelf and his friends, that he might treat of his en- 
largement. But at that time he did not make his peace as it feems ; for it ap- 
pears that the king committed his caftle of Multon in the i Hen. 3. together 
with all his other poffeflions, to William de Albini, to hold during the king's 
pleafure. However, before the end of that year, returning to obedience, he 
had restitution of them. 

In the 2 Hen. 3. command was fent to the fheriff" of Lincolnfhire, to feize 
all his lands in that county, for the arrearages of the fine due for his own re- 
demption then unpaid : And foon after this, Robert de Veteripont received the 
like precept to take good fecurity from him, for the payment of 300/ debt 
to the king ; as alfo for another fum of 164/ Ss id, due to the king by Ada 
de Morvil his wife, it being a fine whereby fhe compounded with king John 
for licence to marry. 

In the 6 Hen. 3. he gave 100/ fine to the king and one palfrey for the office 
of forefter of Cumberland granted to hjm by king John, rendnng 10/ yearly 
into the exchequer-, it being of the inheritance of Ada his wife. 

In the 17 Hen. 3. being fheriflf of Cumberland, he was made governor of 
the caftle of Carlifle â€¢, and was conftituted fheriff of that county for the i8th, 
19th, and half of the 20th year of that king's reign. Moreover he was one of 
the juftices of the king's court of common pleas, and juftice itinerant for divers 
years in the reign of that king. 

He gave to the monks of Calder a moiety of the town of Dereham. To 
the monks of Holm Cultram, common of pafture for 500 fheep in Layfingby. 
Alfo to the hofpital of St. Leonard at Skyrbec in the county of Lincoln he 
gave his whole lordfhip of Skyrbec, with the chapel of Wyneftowe, and ad- 
vowfon of the church of Kirketon. 

In the 24 Hen. 3. he departed this life, leaving iftue as aforefaid, by his 
firft wife, Lambert and Alan â€¢, and by his fecond wife, Thomas, and a daughter 
Julian married to Robert de Vavafour. 

The faid Lambert de Multon, by his wife Amabil de Lucy, had a fon 
and heir Thomas de Multon ; who had another Thomas de Multon; who 
had a third Thomas de Multon ; who had a fon John de Multon ; who died 
without ifiue, leaving three fifters coheirs-, viz. Elizabeth, married to Har- 
rington of Harrington-, Johan, married to Robert Fitzwalter; and Marga- 
ret, married to Thomas Lucy, great grandfon of Alice fecond daughter of Ri- 
chard Lucy and of Alan de Multon her hufband, whereby a third part of this 
moiety of the Lucy inheritance remained in the Multon family. The Har- 
rington fhare defcended to Thomas Grey duke of Suffolk, on whofe attainder 
in the reign of queen Mary it was forfeited to the crown. What became of 
the Fitzwalter fhare, we have not certainly found. 

The Arms of Multon were ; Gules, 3 bars Argent. 

Alice, the fecond daughter of Richard de Lucy aforefaid, had to her faid 
hufband Alan de Multon^ a fon and heir, viz.

PARISH OF CROSTHWAITE. 

We have already treated of that part of this parifh which lies within the 
barony of Allerdale above Derwent. 

The greateft part of this parifh was anciently the inheritance of a family of 
the name de Derwentwater, fo called from the place; which family had alfo^ 
large pollcffions in other parts of this county and in divers other counties. In

the 20 Ed. 1. on an inquifition concerning the furniture of a chantry in the 
chapel of Bolton in Weltmorland, it was found (amongft other particulars) 
that the faid chantry was founded by the anceftors of Sir John de Derwentwater 
then lord of that manor. 

By fevcral inquifitions poft mortem it appears that the faid family were owners 
of the faid manor of Bolton for a long time. In the 20 Ed. 2. John de Der- 
wentwater held the fame. 

In the 48 Ed. 3. John de Derwentwater knight was fheriff of Cumberland : 
His feat at Derwentwater : And his arms, Argent, two bars Gules ; on a can- 
ton of the fecond, a cinquefoil of the firft. â€” He was again fheriff in the 50th 
of the faid king ; as alfo in the ift and 4th of Ric 2. And likewife one of 
the reprefentatives in parliament for the county in the 2d and again in the 1 ith 
Ric. 2. 

This Sir John de Derwentwater had a daughter and heir Margaret married to 
Sir Nicholas Radclffe of Dilfton in the county of Northumberland knight. 
Accordingly in the 36 Hen. 6. we find, that Nicholas Raacliffe knight then held 
the manor of Bolton. He had iffue by his faid wife Margaret de Derwentwater 
a fon and heir, viz. 

Sir Thomas Ratcliffe knight, who married Margaret daughter of Sir William 
Parr of Kendal caitle, and by her had iffue; firft, John who had a fon alfo 
called John, who died without iffue : Secondly, Sir Richard Ratcliffe knight, 
who had a fon Richard who died without iffue male : And four other fons, 
Edward, Nicholas, Chnftopher, and Rowland, the two laft of whom were 
profeffed of the Romifh church. 

Sir Edward Ratcliffe knight, third fon and furviving heir male of Thomas, 
married Anne daughter and heir of John Cartington of Cartington ; and by 
her had iffue Cuthbert and John : Which John died in the 19 Hen. 8. and was 
buried in Croft hwaite church, as appears from the following infeription on a 
brafs plate in the quire : 

" Of your charity pray for the foul of Sir John Radcliffe knight, and for 
" the foul of dame Alice his wife ; which Sir John died the 2d day cf Feb. 
" Ann. Dom. 1527; on whofe foul Jefu have mercy." 

Sir Cuthbert Ratcliffe knight fon and heir of Edward, married Margaret 
daughter of Henry lord Clifford ; and by her had iffue George, Thomas, and 
Anthony. 

In the 33 Hen. 8. Sir Cuthbert Ratcliffe knight held Bolton. And on a fur- 
vey of knights fees in Cumberland in the 35 Hen. 8. it is found, that Cuthbert 
Ratcliffe knight held the manor of Talentire, and divers meffuages, lands, 
and tenements in Cafllerigg and in the ifland cf Derwentwater, of the king as 
of his manor of Papcaftre, by the fervice of two knights fees, 23 s 3d corn-r 
age, i6^feawake, puture of the ferjeants, and fuit of court at Papcaftre ; late 
in the tenure of Anne lady Ratcliffe. 

Sir George Ratcliffe knight, fon and heir of Cuthbert, married Catherine 
daughter of Sir John Mallory knight, and had iffue only one fon, viz. 

Francis Ratcliffe of Derwentwater and Dilfton efquire, who married Ifabel 
â–  daughter of Sir Raphe Grey of Chillingham knight ; and had iffue Edward, 

Thomas, 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Wythburn.) 79 

Thomas, Francis, John, Cuthbert, Mary, Margaret, Catherine, Elizabeth, 
Dorothy, Anne, and Jane. 

Edward Ratdiffe efquire fon and heir of Francis, was living when this pe- 
digree was certified at an herald's vifitarion of Northumberland in the 13 Cha. 1. 
He married Elizabeth daughter of Thomas Barton of Whenby efquire -, and 
was afterwards advanced to the degree of baronet. He had iflue a fon and 
heir, viz. 

Sir Francis Ratdiffe baronet, who married the lady Mary Tudor natural 
daughter of king Charles the fecond by Mrs. Mary Davis, and was created by 
king James the fecond baron of Dilfton, vifcount Langley, and earl of Der- 
wentwater. 

He was fucceeded by his fon James earl of Derwentwater, who married Ma- 
ry-Anne daughter of Sir John Webb of Dorfetfhire baronet. And being en- 
gaged in the rebellion in 1715, he was attainted and beheaded on Tower hill 
in 1716. His lady died in 1723, of the age of about 30 years, and was buried 
at Louvain in the church of tie Englifh regular canoneffes of St. Auftin. He 
had a fon, who died in 173 1 unmarried ; and a daughter married to the lord 
Petre in 1732, who received with her a fortune of about 30,000/. 

The Arms of Radcliff are ; Argent, a bend ingrailed fable. 

The forfeited eflates were vefted in the king for the ufe of the public, and 
fettled upon Greenwich hofpital by act of parliament. The tenants to pay 
fines on the death of the king, as if he were a private perfon. â€” The eftates- 
were, the manors of Caftlerigg, Derwentwater alias Kefwick, Thornthwaite, 
Alfton moor, and Garngill, in the county of Cumberland : And in the county 
of Northumberland, the barony of Langley, the manors of Whittingftall, 
Newlands, Dilfton, Aydon, Shields, Warke, Elrington, Meldon, Spindlefton, 
Utchefter, Throckley, Coaftley, Middleton hall, Thornton, Eaftweftwood, 
and Thornborough â€¢, and other eftates in about eight and thirty different places 
in the faid county : And divers eftates at Scremerfton, Holy Ifland, Anncroft, 
Tweedmouth, Norham, and Lowick in the county of Durham. 

Two miles eaft from Borrowdale, behind Borrowdale fells, lies Wythburn,, 
being a townfhip and chapelry within this parifh. It was a manor of the Brath- 
waites of Warcop, until Richard Brathwaite efquire fold it to Sir George 
Fletcher of Hutton hall, in whofe pofterity it flill continues. 

The mountains here are very profitable to the inhabitants, for nourifhing 
their herds of cattle and flocks of fheep, which are very numerous. 

At the foot of Wythburn, there is a large and broad meer or lake called 
Brackmeer, well furnifhed with pike, perch, and eels ; being above a mile 
in length, and near half a mile broad : from the north end whereof iffues the 
river Bure, which falls into Derwent below Kefwick. 

A little below Brackmeer, at the head of Burefdale, ftands an ancient feat of 
the Leathes's, called Dalehead ; which gave name to a family of the Dales y 
whofe daughter and heir was married to Leathes of Leathes in the panfh of 

Aketonv 



8 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Castlerigg.) 

Aketon. This townfhip bending weftward, fpreads itfelf wider, being lefs 
mountainous-, hath many beautiful inclofures, rich meadows, and fertile paf- 
ture ground, till we come to Casti erigg, the ancient feat of the lords of the 
manor of Derwentwater. But after the heirefs of that family was married to 
the Ratcliffs, the family feat was removed into Northumberland, and the caftle 
went to ruin ; and with the ftones thereof, the Ratcliffs built an houfe of plea- 
fure in one of the iflands in Derwentwater; and the demefne was broken into 
tenancies, whereof Gawen Wren's was the principal, which was alfo infran- 
chifed : only the ancient park, which bends towards Derwentwater fide, con- 
tinues in demefne, and was replenished with a prodigious quantity of tall 
{lately large oaks ; all which the truftees of Greenwich hofpital have cut down 
and fold, but within a few years laft paft they have made fome fmall plant- 
ations. 

In the neighbourhood of this place, on the right hand fide of the road lead- 
ing from Kelwick to Penrith, is a monument of great antiquity (perhaps a 
Britifh place of worfhip), of about 30 yards in diameter, and confiding of 39 
ftones irregularly placed, and of unequal place and fize ; and on the eaft fide 
thereof, and within the circle or area, are two more rows of like ftones, in- 
cluding a fpace of about eight yards in length and four in breadth. 

On the north fide of Cafileri/g, upon the river Bure, may yet be feen the 
foundations and ruins of the forges, milns, and woikhoufes, made ufe of by 
the miners of the lead and copper mines here, which were many in number, 
and were kept going and in good repair till the years 1641 and 1642, when 
they were burned by the rebels in the civil wars. 

In this parifb in Seatallor fell is that famous mine of black lead or wad t a mi- 
neral very fcarce elfewhere to be met with. Mr. Camden calls it that mineral 
earth or hard fhining (tone, which painters ule in drawing their lines and {had- 
ing their pieces in black and white; which whether it be Diofcorides's Pnigitis, 
or Melanteria, or Ochre (a fort of earth burnt black), he leaves to others to 
determine. 

Mr. Robin/on, in his natural hiftory of Weftmorland and Cumberland, fays, 
*' Its compofition is a black, pinguid, and fhining earth, impregnated with lead 
and antimony. Its natural ufes are both medicinal and mechanical. It is a 
prefent remedy for the cholic; it eafeth the pain of gravel, ftone, and ftran- 
gury: and for thefe and the like ufes it is much bought up by apothecaries 
and phyficians, who understand more of its medicinal ufes, than 1 am able to 
give account of. The manner of the country people's ufing it, is thus : Firlf, 
they beat ic fmall into meal, and then take as much of it in white wine or ale, 
as will lie upon a fixpence ; or more, if the diltcmper require it. It opeiates 
by urine, fweat, and vomiting. This account I had from thofe who had fre- 
quently ufed it in thefe diftempers with good fuccefs. Befides thofe ufes that 
are medicinal, it hath many other ufes which increafe the; value of it. At the 
firft difcovering it, the neighbourhood made no other ufe of it, bur for mark- 
ing their (heep ; but it is now made ufe of to glaze and harden crucibles and 
other vefiels made of earth or clay, that are to endure the hotteft fire j and to 
3 th *t 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Castlericg.) $i 

that end it is wonderfully effectual, which much inhaunceth the price of fuch 
veffels. By rubbing it upon iron arms, as guns, piftols, and the like, and 
tinging of them with its colour, it preferves them from rufting. It is made 
ufe of by dyers of cloth, making their blues to ftand unalterable. For thefe 
and other ufes, it is bought up at great prices by the Hollanders and others. 
This mundic ore, having little of fulphur in its compofition, will not flow 
without a violent heat. It produceth a white regulus, fhining like filver. It 
cannot be made malleable." 

Bifhop Nicolfotty in a letter to Dr. Woodward, Aug. 5, 1710, fpeaks of 
this mine as follows : â€” " Having lately had notice of the opening of our 
wad mines above Kefwick, I hafted (with fome others) to fee a curiofity which 
I never hitherto had an opportunity of viewing, and if this were omitted, 
I was never likely to have another. From Kefwick we travelled up the 
valley of Borrowdale along the banks of Derwentwater fix or feven miles or 
more, till we came to Scewhaite moor, where afcending an high mountain 
we at length reached the mine, and were courteoufly received by Mr. Shep- 
herd one of the proprietors of the work, who was here waiting for his co- 
partner Mr. Banks. On the firft opening of the old level in the latter end of 
June laft, great difcouragements appeared ; for no fearch having been made 
in 32 years, they found that fome pilfering interlopers had carried on the old 
work, till they had loft it in the rock. Upon the 3d of July (the day before 
we got thither) a new belly was happily difcovered, above the fore head of 
the old man, which proved fo rich that in lefs than 24 hours they had filled 
feveral facks with fine and clean waflied mineral. It lies intermixed with an 
hard greenifh rock, but appeared in the midft of that of a full round vein or 
body of above three foot in diameter. Dr. Merret, in his Pinax., p. 218, 
would perfuade one to believe, that this mineral is fo very fcarce, that it is no 
where in the univerfe to be met with, fave only in Old and New England, 
and that this is the only place within the four feas where it can be had with 
us: Whereas Sir Robert Sibbaldf affures us that it may be had in the fhire 
of Aberdeen, the defcription and natural hiftory whereof is now under his 
confederation-, and Mr. Dale's,^ invenitur infodinis would induce one to believe 
it to be a very common mineral. Nay the author laft mentioned particularly 
reckons up three feveral forts of it, brought from as many diftant countries, 
whereof he allows that of our Englifh growth to be the beft, that of Spain 
the next, and condemns what is brought from the Eaft Indies as the worft of 
all. 'Tis ftrange that it fhould be the natural produce of fo many parts 
of the globe, and yet that father Kircher, in his Mundus Subterro.neus % fhould 
have no account of it ; and ftranger yet, that none of the ancient naturalifts 
fhould fo much as touch upon the name or thing. Neither the Mtlanteria nor 
Pnigitis of Diofcorides feems to me the leaft related to this mineral; the former 
being defcribed as a fort of liquid ink diftilling from the veins of metals, and 
the latter appears to be of the fame kind with that black chalk which Dr.

Plot f found in Oxfordfhire. That learned gentleman indeed elfewhere falls in 
with Mr. Camden's opinion Â§, that this black lead (improperly fo called, for 
that is the right name of our common lead as diftinguifhed from tin) is a (tony 
fort of black ochre, becaufe it is neither fubject to fufion or ductility in 
the fire, nor to a dlTolution in the water. Yet a fufion it muft have, if Dr. 
Leigh is to be credited J, who aflerts that the Dutch ufe it in glazing rheir 
earthen pots ; which he feems to confirm by an experiment tried in his own 
fight. My fagacious neighbour Mr. Robinfon* will have it to be a mundic ; 
which he afterwards more fujly explains by a black, pinguid, and fhining' 
earth, impregnated with lead and antimony. It will, he fays, flow with 
a great heat, but cannot be made malleable. What he reports of its eating 
the pains of gravel, (lone, and ftrangury, is more than is confirmed to me ; 
but the neighbours generally fubferibe to his aflertion of its being a prefent 
remedy for the cholick. That the dyers ufe it for the ftrengthening of their 
blues, is more than I have learned from any other hand. The chief ufe that 
Mr. Camden or Sir Robert Sibbald knew, of it, was for drawing the lines and fhad- 
ing the pieces of the painters; but Mr. Dalef-f hath added fundry more â€” 
refrigerat, ficcat, repelht, ufus pracipuus adverfus ftrumas tumorefque frigidos et 
phlegmaticos. Dr. Merret || fpeaks of a certain blue (lone in Lancashire which 
the inhabitants there call killow ; and its ufe he obferves to. be the fame as of 
our black lead, for drawing lines. I am very confident, that not only the 
ufes but the matter of both are the fame â€¢, and that this nigrica fabrilis and hij 
killow differ no otherwife, than that the former name was happily coined 
by himfelf, and well exprelTes the true meaning of the latter. Sir Robert 
Sibbald tells us, that his countrymen give the name of keel to the rubrica fabri- 
lis or common ruddle (tone, and that the nigrica is called by them kiiloyne.. 
Now, the Irilh (from whom the Highland Scots may be prefumed to have 
borrowed thefe two words) exprefs all forts of minerals or foflils by kniler 
mixeigh, and vinne in their language is the fame as caotb, blind or dark. "We 
are likewife told, that the men of Kefwick ** (where are alfo many remains of 
the Irifh or Manks tongue) call their black lead indifferently either kellow or 
wadf; the latter of which is doubtlefs from the Saxon name oiwoad or glajlum^ 
which (fays Mr. Ray J^) affords a better dye than lndico." 

In the act of parliament 25 Geo. 2. c. 10. making it felony to break into 
any mine or wad hole of wad or black cawke, commonly called black lead, or 
to (leal any from thenrc, there is a recital that the fame hath been difcovered 
in one mountain or ridge of hills only in this realm, and that it hath been 
found by experience to be neceifary for divers ufeful purpofes, and more par- 
ticularly in the cafting of bomb (hells, round (hot, and cannon balls. 

It is hoped the very ingenious Dr. Brownrigg will oblige the world with a 
diflertation on this mineral, in which, he had made confiderable progrefs fome 
years ago.

ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Keswick.) 83 

The principal place in this large parifh is the market town of Keswick; of 
which, and of the lake adjoining, we find the following account in Camden's 
Britannia : " Derwent, after it has palled through the hills, fpreadeth abroad 
" into a large lake : Bede termeth it pr^cgrande Jlagnum" 

The late Dr. Brown, in a letter to a friend, defcribes it in an elegant and 
very picturefque manner : "In my way to the north, I pafifed through Dove- 
" dale â€¢, and, to fay the truth, was diiappointed in it. When I came to 
" Buxton, I vifited another or two of their romantic fcenes ; but thefe are 
*â€¢ inferior to Dovedale. They are but poor miniatures of Keswick ; which 
*' exceeds them more in grandeur, than 1 can give you to imagine j and moreÂ» 
'Â« if pofiible, in beauty than in grandeur. 

** Inftead of the narrow flip of valley which is feen at Dovedale, you have 
" at Kefwick a vaft amphitheatre, in circumference about twenty miles. In- 
" (lead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten miles round, of an 
" oblong form, adorned with a variety of wooded iflands. The rocks indeed 
" of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed, and irregular ; but the hills are both 
â€¢* little and unanimated â€¢, and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with 
" weeds, morafs, and brufhwood. But at Kefwick, you wil!^ on one fide of 
â€¢' the lake, fee a rich and beautiful landfkip of cultivated fields, rifing to the 
*' eye, in find inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily difperfed â€¢ 
" and climbing the adjacent hills, fhade above fhade, in the moft Various and 
t* picturefque forms. On the oppofite fliore, you will find rocks and cliffs of 
" ltupendo'-'S height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, 
" fome of them a thoufand feet high, the woods climbing up their fteep and 
" fhaggy fides, where mortal foot never yet approached. On thefe dreadful 
*' heights the eagles build their nefts. A variety of waterfalls are feen pour- 
Â«' ing from their fummits, and tumbling in vaft fheets from rock to rock in 
4 * rude and terrible magnificence. While on all fides of this immenfe am- 
" phitheaire, the lofty mountains rife round, piercing the clouds in fhapes as 
" f t iry and fantaftic, as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I muft add the 
" frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble 
<s bays and promon'ories. In other parts they finally retire from it, and often 
" open til abrupt chafms or clefts, through which at hand you fee rich and 
" cultivated vales, and beyond thefe at various diftance, mountain rifing over 
â€¢* mountain â€¢, among which, new profpefts preftnt themfelves in mift, till the 
" eye is lolt in an agreeable perplexity, 

*' Where atlive fa, cy travels beyond fenfe, 

" And pi blur es things unfeen. 

vi Were I to analyfe the two places into their conftituent principles, I 
" fhould tell you, that the full perfection of Kefwick confifts of three circum- 
â€¢' ftanccs, beauty, horror, and magnificence united ; the fecond of which is 
'* alone found in Dovedale : Of beauty it hath little, nature having left it almoft 
" a defert : Neither its imall extent, nor the diminutive and lifelefs form of the 
" hills admit magnificence. But to give you a compleat idea of thefe three 
" perfections, as they are joined in Kefwick, would require the united powers 
'* of Claude, Salvator, and Pouffin. 1 he firft fhould throw his delicate fun- 

M 2 " fhine

" mine over the cultivated vales, the fcattered cots, the groves, the lake,. 
*' and wooded iilands. The fecond fhould dafh out the horror of the rugged- 
" cliffs, the fteeps, the hanging woods, and foaming waterfalls ; while the 
" grand pencil of Poujfin fhould crown the whole, with the majefty of the- 
'* impending mountains. 

" So much for what I would call the -permanent beauties of this aftonifhing 
" fcene. Were I not afraid of being tirefome, I could now dwell as long on 
" its varying or accidental beauties. I would fail round the lake, anchor in 
" every bay, and land you on every promontory and ifland. I would point 
" out the perpetual change of profpect : The woods, rocks, cliffs, and 
" mountains, by turns vanifhing or riling into view : Now gaining on the 
" fight, hanging over our heads in their full dimenfions, beautifully dreadful; 
"- and now, by a change of fituation, affuming new romantic fhapes, retiring* 
" and leffening on the eye, and infenfibly lofing themfelves in an azure mift. 
" I would remark the contraft of light and fhade, produced by the morning 
" and evening fun ; the one gilding the weftern and the other the eaftern fide 
" of this Lmmenfe amphitheatre ; while the vaft fhadow projected by the 
" mountains buries the oppofite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the 
" eye can hardly penetrate : The natural variety of colouring, which the 
" feveral objects produce, is no lefs wonderful and pleafing: The ruling tin&s 
" in the valley being thofe of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, 
" arifing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the grafs, and corn 
â€¢" fields : Thefe are nobly contrafted by the grey rocks and cliffs ; and the 
" whole heightned by the yellow ftreams of light, the purple hues, and mifiy 
" azure of the mountains. Sometimes a ferene air and clear fky difclofe the* 
" tops of the higheft hills : At others, you fee the clouds involving their 
" fummits, refting on their fides, or defcending to their bafe, and rolling 
* c among the vallies, as in a vaft furnace. When the winds are high, they 
" roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder â€¢,, then, too, the clouds 
" are feen in vaft bodies fweeping along the hills in gloomy greatnefs, while 
Â«* the lake joins the tumult, and toffes like a fea : But in calm weather, the 
Â«' whole fcene becomes new : The lake is a perfect mirror ; and the landfkip 
" in all its beauty, iflands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains are feen 
*Â« inverted, and floating on its furface. I will now carry you to the top of a 
Â»* cliff, where, if you dare approach the edge, a new fcene of aftonifhment 
" prefents itfelf, where the valley, lake, and iflands feem lying at your feet ; 
Â«* where this expanfe of water appears diminilhed to a little pool, amidft the 
" vaft immeafurable objects that furround it ; for here the fummits of more 
" diftant hills appear beyond thole you had already feen ; and rifing behind 
" each other in fucceflive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken 
Â«Â« fteeps, form an immenfe and awful picture, which can only be expreffed by 
â€¢* the image of a tempeftuous fea of mountains. â€” Let me now conduct you 
** down again to the valley, and conclude with one circumftance more â€¢, 
" which is, that a walk by ftill moon-light (at which time the diftant water- 
** falls are heard in all their variety of found) among thefe inchanting dales, 

** opens

â€¢* opens a fcene of fuch delicate beauty, repofe, and folemnity, as exceeds all 
" defcription." 

Dr. Dalton, in his elegant poem addrefied to the two young ladies at 
Whitehaven, fpeaking of the rocks of Lodore from whence there is a very, 
high cafcade into this lake, has the following reflections : 
** Horrors like thefe at firft alarm, 

But foon with favage grandeur charm,. 

And raife to nobleft thought the mind : 

Thus, nigh thy fall, Lodore, reclin'd, 

The craggy cliff, impending wood, 

Whofe fhadows mix o'er half the flood, 

The gloomy clouds, which folemn fail, > 

Scarce lifted by the languid gale Â£ 

O'er the cap'd hill, and darken'd vale ; j> 

The ravening kite, and bird of Jove, 

Which round th' aerial ocean rove, 

And, floating on the billowy iky, 

With full expanded pennons fly, 

Their flutt'ring or their bleating prey 

Thence with death-dooming eye furvey 5-.

Rocks to the lake in thunder born, 

Or fuch as o'er our heads appear 

Sufpended in their mid career, 

To ftart again at his command, 

Who rules fire, water, a : r, and land, 

I view with wonder and delight, 

A pleafing, tho' an awful fight : 

For, feen with them, the verdant ifles 

Soften with more delicious fmiles, 

More tempting twine their opening bowers y 

More lively glow the purple flowers, 

More fmoothly flopes the border gay, 

In fairer circle bends the bay, 

And laft, to fix our wand'ring eyes, 

Thy roofs, O Kefwick, brighter rife- 

The lake and lofty hills between, 

Where giant Skiddaw Ihuts the fcene." 

Amongft other particulars, he takes occafion to caution the traveller not to 
be fhocked with fome late violations of thofe facred woods and groves, by the 
commiftioners of Greenwich hofpital ordering the woods to be cut down^ 
which had for ages (haded the fhores and promontories of that lovely; 
lake : For, 

" Where the rude axe with heaved flroke 
" Was never heard the nymphs to daunr, 
" Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt,'* 

there

However (he adds) the vifitant, for his confolation may ft ill, notwith- 
ftanding all thofe profanations, expect to find there an afiemblage of fuch 
exquifite, though different, beauties, as will well deferve to be admired by 
him, as much perhaps as any one part of the inanimate creation. 

The lake is of an orbicular form ; abounding with large pikes, eels, 
trouts, and perch, a great ftore of water fowl, as ducks, mallards, teals, and 
widgeons. 

There are in it three iflands : 

The fir ft ifland is about the middle of the lake, being in a manner round, 
and above half a mile in compafs. It was heretofore full of wood, which 
grew about a little houfe which was called St. Herbert's hermitage. In 
the regifter of bifhop Appleby in the year 1374, there is an indulgence 
of forty days to every of the inhabitants of the parifh of Crofthwaite that 
fhould attend the vicar to St. Herbert's ifland on the 13th of April yearly, and 
there celebrate mafs in memory of St. Herbert -f*. This ifland now belongs 
to the houfe of Brayton ; and the late Sir Wil r rid Lawfon, about the year 
1761, cut down all the old wood and planted the ifland anew. 

The fecond ifland lies nearer to the fhore, of an oval figure, being a quarter 
of a mile long, and half as much broad. This, it is faid, was inhabited by 
the miners, until their works were deftroyed by the civil wars ; though now 
there is fcarce fo much as the foundation of any houfe to be feen. 

The third ifland contains about fix acres of ground, and lies north of the 
fecond, and nearer to Kefwick. It goes by the name of the Vicar's ifland, 
having belonged formerly to Fountain Abbey in Yorkfhire, to which the 
church of Crofthwaite was appropria r ed ; and was granted by king Hen. 8. 
(amongft many other poffefiions belonging to the faid abbey) to one John Wil- 
liamfon. It is now the inheritance of the Ponfonbys of Hale. 

The mountain Skidaw is about eleven hundred yards perpendicular from 
the Broadwater. It rifes with two heads, like unto Parnaffus â€¢, and with a 
kind of emulation beholds Scruffel hill before it in Annandale in Scotland. 
By thefe two mountains, according as the mifty clouds rife or fall, the people 
dwelling thereabouts make their prognostication of the change of the weather, 
and have a common expreffion,

If Skidaw hath a cap, 
Scruffel wots full well of that. 

Like as there goes alio another faying concerning the height of this hill with 
two others in this kingdom, 

Skidaw, Lanvellin, and Cafticand, 
Are the higheft hills in all England. 

Upon the top of this mountain, there is a blue flate ftone, about a man's 
height, which they call Skidaw man. And a little further fouth, upon the 
faid mountain top, was- erected in the year 1689 an houfe five yards fquare, 
and four yards high, by Mr. John Adams the geographer, for placing his 
telefcopes and optic glafies, having from thence a full proipect and view of 
thefe two counties, whereby he was enabled to give the better defcription 
thereof by dimenfions. But he being arretted, firft by his engraver for debt, 
and not long after by death, his project proved abortive. 

On the fouth fide of this mountain lies the manor of Brundbam or Brund- 
bolm, being a large manor of cuftomary tenants. It was part of the poflef- 
fions which Henry the fixth earl of Northumberland gave to king Henry the 
eighth. Which faid king by letters patent July 15, in the 35th year of his 
reign, granted the fame to Thomas Dalfton efquire, together with the manors 
Â©f Uldale, Caldbeck-Upperton, and Kirkbride. It afterwards belonged to 
the Tolfons of Wood hall â€¢, who fold the fame to Mr. Relph of Cockermouth j 
after whofe death it came to the HafTels of Dalemain, in which family it (till 
continues. It comprehends the feveral villages of Brundham, Applethwaite, 
Milnbeck, and Syzick ; being well fhaded with wood on the north banks of 
Bure. Thefe are in this manor about 34 cuftomary tenants who pay arbitrary 
fines, and about 38 freeholders. 

The church is dedicated to St. Kentigern, and valued in the king's books at 
50/ 8 s n^d. It was given by Alice de Rornley to Fountains abbey in York- 
lhire aforefaid, and foon after appropriated to that abbey, the collation there- 
unto being referved to the bifhop of Carlifle. 

The prefent revenue is about 140/ a year; it enjoys all the tithes of the 
whole parifh, corn tithe only excepted. The late vicar Mr. Chnftian, after a 
long and expenfive fuit in the exchequer, recovered the fight of the wool 
in tithing, and alfo the tithe of hog wool and lamb; which increafed the 
revenue of the vicarage very confiderably. 

In 1294, Mr. Jceffrey Whethamjlede was collated to the vicarage of Crof- 
thwait, faving to the abbot and convent of Fountains a yearly penfion of ten< 
marks. 

In 1 3 13, Richard de Grayftoke was collated, faving the faid penfion. 

In 1335, Sir Richard, vicar of Crofthwaite, at the bifhop's vifitation, proves- 
his being canonically ordained, and was difmifled. 

In 134.0, the abbot and convent of Fountains, by their proctor prove 
their title to the impropriation of Crofthwaite, at the bifhop's vifitation. 

In 1354, the bifhop appoints two commiffioners to judge a caufe depending 1 
between the abbot and convent of Fountains complainants, and Thomas Lune 

^ vicar

vicar of Crofthwaite refpondent; wherein the faid abbot and convent demanded 
a yearly penfion of ten marks, and an oath of fealty from the faid vicar. 

In 1359* upon an appeal to the court of Rome, by John Henry de Brougb- 
ton vicar of Crofthwaite, complaining of his fufferings by a difpute between 
his predeceflbr Thomas Lune and W. de Celario (the pope's provifor), and the 
pope's apoftolical letters thereupon ; the bifhop refers the inquiry to certain 
commiffioners. 

In 1360, John deWelton was collated, on h : s making oath (according to the 
canon) of perfonal refidence. Soon after which, a prohibition came from the 
king againft the bifhop's admitting any new vicar, till his majefty's title to the 
advowfon (then depending in court) were confidered. 

In 1 361, Peter de Mor land vicar of Torpenhow is appointed commenda- 
tory curate of Crofthwaite, during the vacancy of that vicarage : And pre- 
fently afterwards, upon his refignation, the fame is given in commendam to 
John Boon. 

In 1567, on the death of John Ratcliff the lafl incumbent, John Maybraye 
was collated by bifhop Beft. And in the next year, on his refignation, Wil- 
liam Bennet was collated. 

In 1585, on William Bennet's refignation, inftitution was given to Peter 
May/on, who was prefented by Michael Benfon of Loughrigg in the county of 
Weftmorland, affignee of Laurence Charlies of Rofe Cattle gentleman, to 
whom the bifhop had granted that avoidance. 

In 1592, on Peter Mayfon's refignation, Robert Beck was collated; who 
likewife refigning in 1597, Peter Beck was collated. 

In 1602, on Peter Beck's refignation, Dr. Giles Robin/on, the bifhop's 
brother, was collated. 

In 1623, on Dr. Robinfon's death, bifhop Milburne gave the vicarage to 
Jfaac Single 'ton, M. A. 

In 1661, Henry Mar Jh all, M. A. was collated. 

In 1667, Richard Lowry, M. A. 

In 1 7 10, Thomas Tullie, M. A. 

In 1727, Thomas Nicolfcn, LL. B- 

In 1728, Thomas Chrijlian, B. A. 

In 1770, James Stephen Lufhington, M. A. was collated by bifhop 
Law. 

There are in this parifh five chapels of eafe ; viz. 

1. St. John's, about three miles diftant from the mother church, which 
was returned to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 4/ \Â§s. But in the 
year 1719, it was augmented by the faid governors with 200/, in conjunction 
with 200/ given by Dr. Gafkarth â€¢, the inhabitants alfo gave 100/. With all 
which fums lands were purchafed within this parifh; and the prefent revenue 
of the chapel is upwards of 45/ a year. Dr. Thomas Tullie the then vicar, 
with the confent of the bifhop, gave up the right of nomination to the faid 
Dr. Gafkarth and inhabitants ; the faid Dr. Gafkarth or his heirs to prefent a

The vicar nominates the curates to the four laft named chapels. 

In this parifh they have a particular manner of chufing and fwearing church-

At Kefwick there is afchool, founded by the parifhioners, and endowed with 
two fmall tenements of about 18/ a year. Concerning this fchool, the afore - 
faid commiffioners decree, That whereas two pence for every fire-houfe hath

And on a commiffion of pious ufes, Feb. 16, in the 13 Ja. before Sir Wil- 
liam Hutton knight, John Fleming, Henry Blencowe, John Lowther, and . 
George Fletcher efquires, it is found by the inqueft, that the 18 fworn men,

and

and other occafions of the parifh, and appointed the fchoolmafter, and made 
orders for the government of the fchool, and that the inhabitants h^d by a 
voluntary contribution raifed a fchool ftock of 148/ 2s z^d; neverthelefs, 
that Dr. Henry Robinfon bifhop of Carlifle, Henry Woodward his chan- 
cellor, and Giles Robinfon brother of the faid bifhop and vicar of Crof- 
thwaite, had intermeddled j and that the faid bifhop, fometimes by authority 
of the high commiffion for ecclefiaftical caufes, fometimes as a juftice of the 
peare for the county, and fometimes by his power as ordinary, had interrupted 
the orders of the 18 men, and had committed thirteen of them to prifon . 
Therefore the commiffioners reftore the 18 men to their authority concerning 
the appointing of a fchoolmafter, and the government of the fchool. 

Within this parifh, in the town of Kefwick, was born Sir John Banks, a 
perfon who arrived to the higheft honour in the profeffion of the law, and be- 
came a confiderable benefactor to the place of his nativity. He was educated 
in Queen's college in Oxford, became ftudent in Gray's Inn, was appointed 
attorney to prince Charles, and in the year 1 640 conftituted lord chief juftice 
of the common pleas. In 1641 he attended the king to Oxford, and was there 
admitted of the privy council. He died at Oxford in 1644, and was buried in 
the north ifle of the cathedral church there. In his laft will and teftament he 
devifed to truftees two tenements in Kefwick, 200/ in money, and 30/ a year 
iffuingout of his lands and tenements within the parifh of Crofthwaite for the 
building of a manufacture houfe, and raifing a ftock for the employment and 
maintenance of the poor of the faid parifh. Some of the truftees dying, and 
the reft neglecting the truft repofed in them, the manufacture was difcon- 
tinued, and the charitable gift in a good meafure neglected or mifemployed 
for feveral years-, till in the year 1672 the parifhioners fued out a commiflion 
of charitable ufes, by virtue whereof, upon inquifition and decree thereupon 
fuch juft meafures were taken as to anfwer the pious intention of the donor. 

Thomas Grave bequeathed for the purchafe of freehold lands fo much money 
as raifes an annual rent of 10/; which is yearly diftributed to the poor of the 
parifh on Good Friday. 

Peter Udall gentleman gave a rent charge of 4/11^4^ out of his lands in 
Effex, to be yearly diftributed in manner following : viz. To twelve poor 
people of Great Brathwaite ; five of Little Brathwaite, Portinfkall, and Ul- 
lock ; and three of Thornthwaite ; 3s %d each : To the minifter of the parifh 
for preaching a fermon to them on Candlemafs day 8 s: For a dinner to the 
minifter and truftees on the day of distribution 8s: And to the perfon that 
brings the money out of the fouth 2 s. An addition of 30/ 10 s od principal 
ftock was made to this charity, by the care and management of Mr. Lowry 
then vicar, who recovered fo much arrears from Mr. Udall's reprefentatives ; 
the intereft whereof is given at the difcretion of the vicar and truftees. 

Thomas Williamfon and Agnes Williamfon gave each 20 / to the poor of St. 
John's and Caftlerigg-, the intereft thereof to be laid out in flefh meat pickled, 
hanged, and dried, for their relief on ftormy days in winter, that they may 
not in fuch weather be forced to hazard their lives in feeking of a daily

15/, the yearly intereft thereof to be applied to the fame ufe. 

Unto whom the corn tithes were firfb granted after the difTblution of the 
monafteries, we have not found. But they are now enjoyed by the owners of 
the lands. 

Other poflefTions which had belonged to Fountaine abbey were granted as 
follows j viz King Henry the eighth by letters patent dated June 20, in the 
32d year of his reign, grants to John Williamfon (amongft other particulars) a 
yearly rent of 1 1 s and fervices, which the heirs of Nicholas Raddiff had paid to

PARISH OF BASSINTHWAITE. 

On the north-weft fide of Crofthwaite lies the parifh of Bass-nthw-mte ;. 
which is bounde.l by Crofthwaite on the fouth eaft fide-,, by the bruad 
water or Derwent on the fouth weft, till Caldbeck falls into it below Ewes 
bridge j and by Caldbeck on the weft, unto* a brook that falls into it, which 
fprings on the fouth fide of Binfay fell, and fo to the head of that fpring; 
then crofs over Lanfketh common to the fouth-weft fide of Whitefield, as it 
ftands divided from the park of BafTenthwaite and the Vorhia! beck; fo up 
that water to White water Dafk on the north â€¢, and fo on the eaft fide of Skid- 
daw till it meets with Crofthwaite boundary at Glendermakin. 

This parifh is divided into two conftablewicks j that where the church ftands 
near Crofthwaite being called the High fide â€¢, and the low fide goes by the 
name of the Hawes, where the chapel ftands : Which at firft was all one in- 
tire manor, and granted by Waldeof the firft lord of Allerdale to his baftard 
fon Gofpatric, whofe pofterity took upon them the furname de Bajfenthwaite. 
And fo it defcended, until Sir Adam de BafTenthwaite in the time of Ed, 2. 
having iffue only two daughters, the elder of whom was married to Irton of 
Irton, and the younger unto Martindale, .they by partition divided the patri- 
mony betwixt them : Since which time they have been two diftinft manors. 

Martindale's part continued in the name, until Roger Martindale did forfeit, 
his part for treafon ; whereupon it was granted to the earl of Derby, in which 
family it continued till the year 17 14, when it was given in marriage with the 
lady Henrietta Stanley daughter of the earl of Derby to John lord Afhburnham, 
who in the next year after fold it to the tenants for 1825/, who are now all 
freeholders, about 46 in number, and they pay a quit rent to the earl of Egre- 
mont of 3/ 4J lod. 

The coheir that married Irton, furviving him, married to her fecond huf- 
band Law/on of Little Ofwith in the county of Northumberland couniellor at 
law, and fettled the fame upon him â€¢, who, dying without iffue, gave the fame. 
to his coufin Sir Wilfred Laivfon knighr, who fettld the fame upon his fecond 
fon Wilfred Lawfon efquire, in whofe defcendtnts it ftill continues. There are 
. in this manor about 17 cuftomary tenants, who pay arbitrary fines; a.d 28 in- 
denture tenants, who pay a nine-penny fine only. 'J he whole rent is 2i / 12 J 
iÂ±d. And the lord pays a quit rent to the earl of Egremont of 3/ 4 s lod. 

The aforefaid divifion of the manor appears to have been before the 35 
Hen. 8. for in that year on an inquifition of knights fees it is found, thac 
Richard Irton then held a moiety of the manor of Haftynthwayte of the king 
as of his manor of Papcaftre, by the fervice of a third part of one knight's 
fee, 2 j cornage, 8 d feawake, and witnefman in bkedo : And that the earl of 
Derby held the oth-r moiety, by knights fervice, 6s 8 d cornage, 8 d feawake, 
and fuit of court at Papcaftre. 

This manor is well wooded, efpecially towards the lake, being full of inclo- 
fures and rich meadows; as that lake is of many varieties of fifh and fowl, be- 
ing about five miles long, and in fome places near two miles broad.

In the year 1772, the right to this lake was tried at the affixes at Carlifle, in 
a caufe between the earl of Egremont and Sir Gilfrid Lawfon j when the fol- 
lowing iffues were found for the faid earl : 

That the lake and every part thereof is the freehold of the earl of 
Egremont : 

That the earl is feifed of a feparate fifhery in the whole, except three 
draughts called Ewes bridge, Scone wall, and Ellers ftile, wherein John 
Spedding efquire hath a free 6fhery in common with the faid earl ; and that, 
as owner of the fifhery, he the faid earl and his tenants are intitled to the 
privilege of drawing and landing nets uied in the fifhery on the grounds 
adjoining : 

And that the earl is intitled to the fole navigation of the lake, and to 
land goods upon the grounds adjoining, out of boats and velTels ufed in 
the navigation.

Hugh abbot of Jedworth for the advowfon of the church of Baftinthwait â€¢, 
and it was adjudged to belong to the abbot, by the gift of Waldeof fon of

The dean and chapter of Carlifle are now appropriators and patrons, and 
allow to the curate (by leafe) all the tithes great and fmall, he paying the an- 
cient referved rent of 11/. â€” But by an act of parliament for dividing and 
inclofing the common of BalTenthwaite, the curate after July 1, 1774. fhall 
have land fet out inftead of tithes ; from which time all tithes, modules^ 
prefcriptions, oblations, obventions, furplice fees, and other dues fhall ceafe, 
and be no longer paid. 

The curacy was returned to the governors of queen Anne's, bounty, at 
22/ AfS 8d. 

About the year 1625, Matthew Caipe of the city of Carlifle merchant gave 
his leafe of the tithe corn and (heaves of corn and tithe hav of Levingron 
or Linton holme and Harper hill, to fupport a lecture in Bafienthwait 
church. 

In the year 147 1, divers of the parifhioners petitioned the then bifhop for 
leave to build a chapel in the faid parifh, which was granted to them, on rheif 
engaging to depoiite 50/ for a falary, and to build a dwelling-houie for the 
reader, and lay thereto one acre of land for a garden or orchard. Whereupon 
the chapel, called Hawes chapel* feems to have been then built -, but there is 
no account of any curate* or any thing elfe belonging to it in the bi (hop's archives* 
But in the year 17 48, the lum uf 45/ called by the name of ch.pel (lock, 
unto which the parifhioners added 5/ (probably to fupply what feems to have 
been loft from the ancient ftock), was 1 .id out in a purchafe of lands for 
the ufe and benefit of the curate of Baffenthwaite for ever. So that all along 
the church and chapel feem to have been fupplied by one and the fame curate. 

There are in this parifh about 68 families, all of the eftablifhed church.

PARISH OF ISEL. 

The parifh of Isei. is bounded by the river Derwent from the foot of Cole- 
beck to the foot of Redmain hagg hedge on the fouth; and by the faid hedge 
to the head thereof, and fo crofs the highways to Cockermouth and Bridekirk 
to a field called the Trinities as it is divided from Bridekirk demefnes to the

Threapland gill head on the north ; and fo on the faid courfe to the head 
of Colebeck, and fo down Colebeck to the foot thereof on the eaft. 

This I/el was at firft demefne of AUerdale, an 1 did contain Rughthwaite, 
Blenkrake, Warthole, Redmain, half of l J lumbland, and Sunderland, with, 
their appurtenances. 

Alan fon of Waldieve gave Rughthwaite and a third part of the waftes of 
Ifel, to Gamel de B'un lord of Bothill â€¢, and he gave the principal manor of 
Ifel with the appurtenances, Blencrake, with the fervices of Newton, to 
Ranulph Engain. 

Ranulph had ifTue William Engain ; and he a daughter arid heir Ada Engain 
married to Simon de Morvil, father of Roger de Morvil, Jatner of Hugh de 
Morvil (one of the afTaffins of Thomas a Bccket). 

This Hugh de Morvil had two daughters coheirs Ada and Joan. Ifel was of 
Jlda's purparty. She was firft married to Richard Lucy, to whom (he had 
no iflue male lo her fecond hufband (he married Thomas de Multon, to- 
whom fhe had a fon and heir 1 homas de I niton, who in the reign of Hen. 3. 
intailed Ifall and Blencr ke wi h the appurtenances on his two younger fons 
Edward and Hubert, and their hrirs general fucceffively So the lords of Ifel 
loft the fervices of Newton, becauie that tenure remained to the grantor 
Thomas Multon and his heirs, as it had defcended to him. 

by that intail Hubert Multon enjoyed Ifel, and William his fon after him r 
whole daughter Margaret brought the inheritance into the family of the Leighs 
in Edward the fecond's time. Which Margaret, in the 33 Ed. 3. being then 
widow of Sir William de Lygh knight, had a licence from bifhop Welton for a 
Chaplain in her private oratory within the manor of Ifale. 

In the 35 Hen. 8. John Leigh efquire held the manor of Ifaill and Blencrake

king James the firft. And this brought the Lazv/ons to Ifel, who were a 
Yorkfhire family, deriving their defcent from John Law/on of Fawkefgrave in

appears to have prefented a clergyman to the vicarage of Ifel, being then 
vacant. This William married Elizabeth daughter and fole heir of William 
Beaulie efquire, with whom he had the manor of Hefket in the parifh of 
Caldbeck. And by her he had iffue,

church all the corn tithe within the hamlets of Blincrake, Sunderland, Ifel 
Old Park, and Ifell gate, in lieu of the tithes of I fell demefne. The vicarage

In 1755, on the death of the laft mentioned John Harrifon, John Bell, 
M. A. was prefented by the fame patron. 

The abovementioned Jofeph Williamfon, who was prefented in 1625, was 
father of Sir Jofeph Williamfon fecretary of ftate in the reign of king Charles 
the fecond. The young man, at his firft fetting out in the world, was enter- 
tained by Richard Tolfon efquire reprefentative in parliament for Cocker- 
mouth, in the time of the great rebellion, as his clerk or amanuenfis. When 
at London with his matter, rather than be idle and fquander away his time 
amongft fervants and livery boys, he begged that he would recommend him 
to Dr. Bufby, that he might be admitted into Weftminfler fchool, and have 
his directions how he might proceed in grammatical and clafllcal learning. 
Being a youth of a quick apprehenfion and unwearied diligence, he profited 
in the fchool to admiration. The reverend and learned Dr. Langbain, provoft 
of Queen's college in Oxford, coming to the election at Weftminfler, the 
mafter recommends this northern youth to his favour, with defire that he 
would be pleafcd to take care of him and prefer him amongft his countrymen 
in that college. The provoft, who was a great encourager of learning and 
ingenuity, after a ftridt examination of the boy, complies with the requcft, 
and takes him to Oxford, admits him of the foundation, and provides all 
necefiaries for him at his own expence. As foon as he was bachelor of arts, 
his kind benefactor Dr. Langbain fends him into France, with a perfon of 
quality, as his companion and affiftant in his ftudies. Upon his return to the 
college, he was elected fellow, and (as it is faid) admitted into deacon's 
orders. Soon after the reftoration of king Charles the fecond, he was recom- 
mended to the then fecretary of ftate, who placed him in the paper office as 
Cuftos Archivorum, and made frequent ufe of him in interpreting and writing 
letters and memorials in French. Within a few years, he was advanced to 
the place of fecretary of ftate, created doctor of laws at Oxford, and had the 
honour of knighthood conferred upon him. At the treaty of Nimeguen in 
1679, he was one of the plenipotentiaries on the part of the king of Great 
Britain ; and had the like character at the pacification concluded at Ryfwick 
in 1696. In his life-time, and at his death, he gave to the faid college 
in plate, books, building, and money, to the value of 8000/. To the 
grandchildren of Dr. Langbain his patron he left by will 500/. And he fent 
to this parifh gilt bibles and prayer books, velvet covering and rich linen for 
the altar, with filver flagons and chalices for the adminiftration of the holy 
communion. 

In the church of Bridekirk there is an ancient font, which Camden fays was 
found in the ruins of Papcaftle, amongft: many other monuments of antiquity â€¢, 
being a broad veffel of greenifh ftone, artificially ingraven with little images. 
Bifhop Nicolfon, in his mifcellany account of the diocefe of Carlifle, taken in 
his parochial vifitation in 1703, fays, " I took fome pains in reviewing the 
" Runic infcription on the font in this church, fome account whereof I 
" had long fince given to Sir William Dugdale, publifhed in the Philofophical

Tranfactions for the year 1695, NÂ°. 178, and reprinted in Dr. Gibfon'j 
late edition of Camden's Britannia, p. 841. I found it in fome little parti- 
culars different from what I had at firft obierved it to be." 
Mr. Smith, in the Gentleman's Magazine lor May 1749, defcribes the font 
this manner : " It (lands in a fquare pedeftal, about 8 inches high in the 
upright, and about 3 more in the perpendicular of the Hope, j his fup- 
ports another of about 20 inches, and over all this is the font, about 
20 inches more, pretty near a cube hollowed, being 22 inches on the fouth. 
and north fides, and 20 on the other two. It faces the porch door, is lined 
with lead, and perforated at bottom to take off the baptifmal water, and 
muft be at lead of 900 years {landing. The front or fjuth fide engraving 
is between 3 fillets ; the uppermoft, I imagine, contains two JEgoceri or fea 
goats, the ancient reprefentation of Capricorn, in whole fign the fun was at 
the birth of Chrifl, and probably alludes to that -, the middle fillet has 
a feftoon of grapes, and an human figure catching at a clufter, perhaps to 
intimate the miftery of the p.-fllon, or of the I ucharift, and the advantages 
accruing to the partaker. Betwixt that and the third fillet is the infcriptionj 
and below, a female figure, with a cup (as it feemeth) in her hand, and 
fome feftoons. The eaft fide has only two fillets ; the uppermoft contains 
an Amphijbana, or rather an hydra, with two heads, one bent down over its 
body to the ground ; the other erect, with a branch proceeding from 
its mouth, which in its procefs divides into three. The fecond fillet has a 
tree, and Jofeph and Mary (I fuppofe) with the child, as Jofeph is called 
a fruitful branch. The north fide confirms my conjecture on that of the 
fouth, where the two celeftial figns of Capricorn and Sagittary are repre- 
fented. Sagittary is the concluding fign of the year, as Capricorn the initial 
one with regard to the folar return ; intimacing, that the religion which 
fprung from the perfon born when the fun was in Capricorn, would continue 
to the confummation of things, or till the fun had gone into Sagittary, their 
emblem for the laft period. The fillet below on the fame fide, has an 
allufion to the (laughter of the babes at Bethlehem, and a devotee in 
a religious pofture kneeling, and taking hold of the tree of life, notwithr 
(landing the lofs of her child, as the only means of her future acceptance 
and happinels. The weft fide is in the fame tafte, but the figures wafted 
by time." 

Mr. Bell, the prefent learned and very worthy incumbent, obferves, that 
the figures in the fecond fillet on the eaft fide, which Mr. Smith fuppofes 
to be Joleph and Mary, feem evidently to be John baptizing our Saviour ; for

Dr. Hickes, in a letter to bifhop Nicolfom fpeaking of this infcription,. 
fays, it feems to be Dano-Saxonic, and by confequenre neither good Danilh 
nor good Saxon â€¢, and after feveral attempts to explain it, he is forced to leave 
it in the dark. The molt probable interpretation of it is that of the faid 
learned prelate, who thinks it ought to be read thus : 

Er Ekard han men egroften, and to dis men red wer Taner men brogten. 

In Englifh, 

Here Ekard was converted^ and to this man's example were Danijh men brought. 

He conjectures that Ekard was a Danifh general, who being baptized 
at this font, was the occafion of many of his officers and foldiers becoming 
Chriftians. 

Tallentire is the fecond townfhip in this parifh, {landing half a mile 
northweft from Bridekirk, upon the ridge of a hill at leaft half a mile long at 
the weft end of Moothay â€¢, from whence one may fee in a clear day the whole 
Ifle of Man, and all Galloway, Annandale, and divers other counties in the 
ibuth of Scotland, and all Solway Frith, with a great part of the Irifh fea. 

This was firft granted by Waldeof fon of Gofpatric to Odard fon of 
Lyolph, whole polterity took the name of Tallentire. It was afterwards 
purchafed by George Fletcher efquire, fon of Lancelot, fon of Henry, fon of 
William Fletcher of Cockermouth â€¢, in which name it continued till that 
branch ended in daughters, and by Henry MetcheÂ»- efquire was given with his 
fecond daughter Anne in marriage to Matthias i J artis a merchant at Newcaftle 
upon Tyne. 

The tenants of this manor are all infranchifed. 

Dovenby, or Dolphinby, is the next townfhip, a mile weft and by fouth 
from Tallentire ; and was at firft fo called from one Dolphin fon of Aleward, 
who firft feated himfelf here, and called the name of his houfe Dolphinby, 
corruptly Dovenby. Richard de Dovenby was lord thereof in Henry the 
fecond's time ; and his fon Benedict de Bridekirk confirmed to the abbot of 
Caldre lands in Gilcrux. 

The lord Waldeof gave to Dolphin fon of Aleward, with Maud his fifter, 
Applethwa'ue, Little Crofby, Langrigg, and Brigham, with the patronage of 
the church of Brigham. Aleward feated himfelf at Alewardby, calling it 
after his own name. 

After the iflue male of Dolphin became extinguilhed in the reign of Hen. 3. 
one Roger de Roll was pofieffed of Dovenby. In the 3 \ ,Ed. 1. Thomas Lucy 
enjoyed it. In the 23 Ed. 3. Richard Kir kbride had it and died feifed thereof^ 
leaving his fon in ward â€¢, who died 22 Ri. 2. or 1 Hen. 4. leaving a fifter and 

3 heir 



,o 4 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Dovekby.) 

heir married to a younger brother of Sir Thomas Lamplugb of Lamplugh -, in 
whofe iflue male the right defcended to Sir Thomas Lamplugb â€¢, who being 
married to Agnes daughter of Sir Thomas Brathwaite of Burr.elhead, and 
having no iflue of his body, made a fettlement of this whole manor upon his 
faid wife for life, remainder in tail male to his eight brothers fucceflively, and 
for want of fuch iflue to George Lamplugb fon of John fon of Innocent a baftatd 
of that houfe. All the brothers happened to die without iflue male; fo that 
George, after the death of Agnes, entered. But a claim was made on the 
part of two daughters of Anthony Lamplugh^ who (as pretended) had levied a 
fine and thereby cut off" the intail. One of the daughters was compounded 
with. And Abraham Moline (the other daughter's representative) came to an 
agreement with Thomas Lamplugb fon of George, whereby Moline had the 
demefne of Dovenby, and Lamplugb had the manor and rents of Dovenby 
and Papcaftle and the miln, which were by him mortgaged to Brown and 
Haftings two London fcriveners, and by decree confirmed to them. The 
prefent owner thereof is Ralph Cook of Penrith efquire. 

Moline fold the demefne to Richard Lamplugb efquire, who built Dovenby 
hall. He was fucceeded by his fon Robert, whofe fon Richard died in 1763, 
and after fome fpecific legacies bequeathed the refidue of his real and perfonal 
eftate to Henry Curwen efquire for the ufe of his niece Elizabeth Falconer. 

There are in this townfliip an hofpital and fchool, founded by Sir Thomas 
Lamplugh of Dovenby in 1609. 

The hofpital is for four widows, and is endowed with the tithes of Redmain 
in the parifti of Ifel. 

The fchcol is endowed with part of the tithes of Brough, and a clofe in 
Dovenby, and the fchoolmafter hath alfo 4/ a year out of the tithes of Red- 
main for reading prayers to the widows of the hofpital. His whole revenue 
is about 20/ a year. 

Both the hofpital and fchool are in the donation of the houfe of Dovenby. 

Papcastle Hands a mile fouth from Dovenby upon the banks of Derwent 
towards Cockermouth, where lies the carcafe (as it were) of an ancient 
caftle, which by a number of monuments layeth claim to be of Roman 
antiquity. 

This caftle after the conqueft was the feat of Waldeof firfl lord of 
Allerdale, who did afterwards demolifh it, and remove the materials to 
Cockermouth ; of which materials he built the caftle there, wherein he and 
his pofterity inhabited. 

From him it came by his granddaughter Otthreda to Duncan brother of 
David king of Scotland. From that family it came by a daughter and coheir 
to the Lucys ; of whom Richard Lucy fettled the fame on his wife Ada Morvil\ 
who marrying to her fecond hufband Thomas de Multon, the fame defcended to 
Thomas de Multon, who had a daughter and heir Margaret de Multon married 
to Ranulph de Dacre, which brought the fame into the Dacre family, in which 
it continued till forfeited to the crown on the attainder of Leonard Dacre in 
the 12th year of queen Elizabeth. 

Which 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Papcastle.) 105 

Which faid queen, by letters patent bearing date 17th March, in the 38th 
year of her reign, granted to Lancelot Salkeld and Thomas Brathwaite efquires 
and Richard Tolfon junior gentleman, all that manor of Papcafter with all its 
rights, members, and appurtenances ; and all that tenement, and lands arable, 
meadow and pafture, containing by eftimation 34 acres, lying and beino- 
in Papcafter aforefaid, parcel of the faid manor, then or late in the tenure or 
occupation of John Williamfon or his affigns, of the yearly rent of 20s ; and 
fo in like manner lands and tenements in the tenure or occupation of Richard 
Brumfield, William Thompfon, William Paitfon, John Watfon, Richard 
Parker, John Boranfkell, Richard Robinfon, Innocent Lamplugh, George 
Watfon, John Lamplugh, John Wilkinfon, Agnes Bromfield, William Tow- 
fon, Janet Rawes, Alan Ribton, Agnes Fearon, Chriftopher Wheelwright, 
and others, containing in the whole 36 tenements, 529 acres, and 16/ 10 s 
$d rent. 

Soon after, the faid manor appears to have been in the hands of Sir Thomas 
Lamplugh knight, who fettled it upon Agms his wife for life (which Agnes was 
daughter of the faid Thomas Brathwaite, afterwards Sir Thomas Brathwaite, 
of Burnefhead) ; the faid Agnes lived to the age of 100 years, and after the 
death of her hufband (in refpect to his memory) remitted to the cuftomary 
tenants the payment of their general fines. And there being a controverfy 
after her death between the heirs general and the heirs in tail concerning the 
right to that inheritance, the tenants claimed to be exempt from the payment 
ot a general fine, becaufe none had been paid within the memory of any one 
living, and the fame manor not long before had been in the crown, and as the 
king in law never dies, fo in that cafe no general fine can be due. But it ap- 
peared that all along in the time of the Dacres general fines had been paid ; 
and it was determined againft the tenants. 

Broughton ftands a mile weft from Papcaftle, upon the fame fide of 
Derwent, juft oppofite to Brigham. It is a ^leafant well built village, much 
like that of Papcaftle for fituation, facing the fouth fun from the fide of the 
hill which fhelters it from the north weft winds. This is another manor and 
townfhip within this parilh, which was granted by Waldeof firft lord of 
AHerdale with his fifter Oclhreda to Waldeof fon of Gilmin, whofe pofterity 
had the furname de Broughton. 

After the determination of that defcent, this place became the pofTefTion of 
the earls of Northumberland, until Henry the fixth earl of Northumberland 
granted it, together with Dean, Whinfell, and Cockermouth parks, unto 
Sir Thomas Wharton ; which were fold by the truftees of Philip late duke of 
Wharton to the duke of Somerfet, whofe reprefentative the earl of Egremont 
now enjoys the fame, together with Little Broughton, lying half a mile north 
weft : Which two townfhips make up one intire manor, wherein are no 
demefne lands, but divers fubftantial freeholders, and the cuftomary tenants 
pay only a ten-penny fine. 

Jofeph Afhley of Ledgers Afhley in the county of Northampton efquire, in 
the year 1722, built a fchoolhoufe and four houfes for alms men or women in 

Vcl. II. P Great

Great Broughton â€¢, and in 1735 he endowed the faid fchool with one clofe called 
Schoolhoufe clofe, and a rent charge of 16/ a year iffuing out of lands in 
Southwaite and other places ; the truftees to chule a fchool matter, who fhall 
teach gratis the children of the inhabitants of Great and Little Broughton and 
of all the donor's kindred. The truftees alfo 10 nominate the four poor 
perfons to refide in the houfes out of the poor "of Great and Little Broughton; 
if not fo many there, then out of any other vills in the parifh of Bridekifk ; 
the kindred of the donor, however remote in degree, or wherever they dwell 
in the county, to have the preference : To have each 40J yearly, iffuing 
out of the aforefaid land?. On the death of truftees, the furvivors to chufe 
others ; perfons of the name of Afhley to have the preference ; the reft to be 
chofen out of Great and Little Broughton, until they make up the number 
ten in the whole. Twenty fhillings yearly to be paid out of the faid lands for 
the expences of the truftees. 

Ribton is the fixth and laft townlhip in this parifli of Bridekirk, which lies 
about a mile lower weft from Broughton upon Derwent oppofite to Clifton. 
This alfo, after the conqueft, was part of the poffeffion of PValdeof fon of 
Gilmin ; who fettled the fame upon a younger fon Thomas who took the 
furname de Ribton. He had three fons, Alexander, William, and Dow ; but 
William and Dow died without iffue. Thomas had alfo two daughters Magota 
and EUota, the latter of whom died unmarried. Magota was married to Alan 
de Arcleby, who had iffue John de Camerton, who married Sir Gilbert de Culwen's 
daughter, who had iffue Sir Robert Clerks. Alexander fon of Thomas de 
Ribton had iffue John, who married Matilda daughter to Benedict de Lglei- 
field lord of Clifton â€¢, by whom he had iffue Thomas, Alexander, and Jane. 
Thomas had iffue Johanna and Sibbot, who were married into Wenfleydale to 
Thomas Lobley and Edward Crcfs : Alexander Ribton the fecond brother had 
iffue Thomas, who had iffue John, who married the daughter of Robert 
Eeymore. 

In the 35 Hen. 3. John Ribton held the manor of Ribton with the appur- 
tenances, and the vill of Ribton of the king as of his manor of Papcaftre, 
by the fervice of 2 J Sd cornage, 8d feawake, puture of the ferjeants, and 
iuit of court at Papcaftre from three weeks to three weeks. 

Afterwards it was purchafed by Thomas Lamplugh, who being born at 
Beverley in Yorkfhire came into this country in the late civil wars, whofe fon 
Richard Lamplugh elquire fold the fame to the late Sir James Lowther oi White- 
haven, and it is now the poffeffion of Sir James Lowther of Lowther baronet. 

PARISH OF CAMMERTON. 

Next unto Ribton, down the river a mile weft, lies Cammerton, under 
an hill oppofite to Stainburn. It is bounded by the river Derwent on the 
fouth, by the fea on the weft, and by Flemby on the north and eaft. 

This, 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Cammerton.) 107 

This, with Seaton another manor in this parifh, was given by Waldieve 
firft lord of Allerdale, to Orme fon of Ketel with Gunild his filler, who 
dwelt at Seaton, and made it a manor, to which Cammerton is appendant. The 
ruins of which houfe, it is faid, do yet appear. 

Orme had ifTue a fon and heir whom he named Cofpatric, who had ifTue 
Thomas, who had ifTue another Thomas, to whofe brother Alan he gave Cam- 
merlon, which was at firft parcel of the manor of Seaton, and this Alan was 
firft called Alan de Cammerton, and his pofterity were afterwards called Cammer- 
tons, and then Culwens, from Patric Culwen fon of Thomas and brother of the 
faid Alan, who was lord of Culwen in Galloway, and by the death of Thomas 
was firft called Culwen of Workington. Alan had ifTue John, who married 
Ijabel daughter of Gilbert de Culwen, and by her had ifTue Robert Clerkus, who 
was the firft of the Cammerton branch that took the name of Culwen, cor- 
ruptly Curwen, and from that time it hath continued in the male line of the 
Curwens. 

The capital meffuage here is an old ruinous tower, ftanding nakedly at the 
weft end of the town, at the foot of Seaton hill. The demefne is good foil, 
lying warm and low by the river fide, and very extenfive. 

The tenants pay arbitrary fines, and other ufual fervices. 

Seaton is the other only townfhip in this parifh, ftanding a mile northweft, 
on the top of an hill ; and is fo called, becaufe it ftands clofe by the fea. 
This place continues in the male line of the Curwens of Workington, de- 
pendents of Orme, to this very day. The demefnes of Workington and 
Seaton being fevered by Derwent river, were made more convenient one 
to the other by erecting a new ftone bridge at Workington about an hundred 
years ago â€¢, and which failing was rebuilt fome few years fince at the expence 
to the county of 500/. 

The demefne is large, and that part which lies near the river very rich foil ; 
whereas, contrariwife, that part which lies toward the fea is very fandy and 
barren, and fo is the common which interpofeth between the demefne and the 
fea which yet hath its ufe, as containing a large coney warren. â€” Here was 
alfo formerly a very famous horfe courfe, called the Sigget or Sea gate. â€” 
The cuftomary tenants pay arbitrary fines, heriots', and other boons and 
fervices. 

Gofpatric fon of Orme gave this church to the priory of Carl's fie ; but it 
was never appropriate, nor any vicar endowed ; but the monaftery enjoyed all 
the tithes according to the firft original donation, fome inferior members of 
the convent fupplying the cure. Sir James Lowther is now the dean and 
chapter's leffee, under the yearly rent of 8/ 13J \d to them, and 15/ to their 
curate, whom they nominate upon a vacancy. â€” It was returned to the gover- 
nors of queen Anne's bounty at 15/ ioj. 

This parifh contains about 100 families ; whereof, Quakers 3, Prefbyte- 
rians 15, Papifts 4.

Flemby, Flemingby, (fo called, no doubr, from fome of the Flemings inha- 
biting there) is the next village, lying a mile north from Seaton. It is bound- 
ed by the Tea on the north well, by Ewanrigg and Deerham common on the 
north and eaft fides, and by Cammerton and Seaton on the fouth and weft. 
It hath been commonly efteemed extraparochial, but it evidently appears to. 
have been anciently a chapelry within the parifh. of Cammerton ; and to this, 
day they bury their dead at the church of Cammerton. 

It was part of the poffeffions of Orme fon of Ketel, whole fon Gofpatric. 
gave it to the abbey of Holm Cultram, as appears from the grant in the 
original regifter of the faid abbey â€¢, whereby Gofpatric fon of Orme, with the 
confent of Thomas his fon and heir and of Alan his fon, grants to God and. 
St. Mary of Holm Cultram and the monks ferving God there, Flemingby 
with the appurtenances, by the boundaries there fpecified â€¢, with a claufe, that 
he himfelf will do for the fame foreign fervice, as noutegeld and the like due 
to the king â€¢, and alfo fervices to the lord of Allerdale of feawake,. caftleward,. 
pleas, aids, and other fervices f. 

And the fame was confirmed by the faid Thomas fon of Gofpatric Â§ â€¢, who 
alfo granted to them (with the confent of Grace his wife) eight acres of land 
in Seton, contiguous to 32 acres of their own there J. 

And Adam, another fon of Gofpatric, who was alfo parfon of the church 
of Cammerton, granted and quit claimed to them the chapel of Flemingby, 
and all the lands and tithes thereof which belonged to the mother church 
of Cammerton *. 

And Gofpatric's grant was confirmed feverally by king John, king Henry 
the third, and Richard the firft. 

Alice de Romeley, daughter of William Fitz Duncan, granted to them 
common of pafture on Brechton moor for the cattle of their grange of 
Flemingby ||. 

And king Edward the firft granted to them free warren in their demefne of 
Flemingby**. 

In the 7 Ed. 1. Before the juftices itinerant in Cumberland, Robert de 
Haverington, fon of Michael de Haverington, quitted claim to Gervafe abbot 
of St. Mary of Holm Coltram of the manor of Flemingby ; except 380 acres; 
and the abbot and convent took him and his heirs into their prayers f-f. 

After the diffolution of the monafteries, king Flenry the eighth, 9 Jul. in 
the 37th year of his reign, granted to Thomas Dalfton efquire and Eleanor 
his wife (amongft other particulars) nine mefiuages and tenements in Flemby, 
and all other the lands there called Lambert Garths, Thwaite croft, and 
Reygarths, a fifhery in Flemby, and the wood and lands called Flemby park, 
late belonging to the monaftery of Holm Coltram.

And in the 38 Hen. 8. June 11, there is a licence to Thomas Dalfton of 
Carlifle efquire and Eleanor his wife to alienate the faid nine mefluages 
and tenements, and the faid fifhery and park, and alfo twenty other mefluages 
and tenements elfewhere, to John BienerhafTet efquire and his heirs, for the 
fine of 14 s id paid into the exchequer; and from that time Flimby hall 
became the chief refidence of the family, until it was now lately (1772) fold 
by William BienerhafTet efquire to Sir James Lowther baronet. 

This family feems to have fprung from BienerhafTet in this county ; but 
for many generations they feem to hwe lived in or near Carlifle. One of the 
name was mayor of that city in 1382, fo likewife in 1430, and again in 1614, 
and 1620. One of them reprelented the faid city in parliament in the 9 
Ric. 2. fo alfo in the 1 Hen. 5. 20 Hen. 6. 27 and 28 Eliz. and 1 Ja. 
In the 29 Cha. 2. William BienerhafTet efquire was fheriff of the county. 
Their arms are, Gules, a cheveron between 3 dolphins naiant, embowed

The chapel of Flimby hath an ancient falary of 4/ 10s. And hath thrice 
received from the governors of queen Anne's bounty an augmention of 200/

PARISH OF DEERHAM. 

The firft townfhip in this parifh is Elneburgh, (landing a mile eaft front 
Flimby : for now we turn eaftward from the mouth of Elne river to the head 
thereof, taking in the parifhes and townfhips as they lie on the fouth weft 
of that river. Camden, by the way, takes notice of a wall that was made in 
convenient places from Workington to Elneburg for four miles, by Stilico a 
commander in the Roman ftate, when the Scots annoyed the coafts out of 
Ireland, as appears in Claudian â€¢, and he further tells us, that it was at this 
Burgh upon Elne, where the firft band of the Dalmatians with their captain 
made their abode. Camden and Baxter both think this was the ancient 
Volantium ; others call it Olenacum â€¢, but Horfley takes it to be Viroftdam^ and 
fays, there is no one Roman ftation in Britain, where fo great a number 
of inscriptions has been found as at this place ; and molt of the originals are 
yet preferved at Elneburgh hall, the feat of Humphrey Senhoufe efquire,. 
proprietor of the ground on which the ftation has been, being the defcendent 
of John Senhoufe efquire, whom Camden commends for his great civility to 
him and to Sir Robert Cotton, for his fkill in antiquity, and for the great 
care with which he preferved fuch curiofities. The foldiers that feem to have

Scotch king or chieftain ; and after the conqueft there was a family who took 
their name from thence j as Robert de Ewanrigg appears to have been witnefs 
to feveral deeds. In the 42 Ed. 3. the lady Margaret de Multon feems to have 
been in poffedion of this place ; for in that year a licence was granted by the 
bifhop to John de Thwaytes to be domeftic chaplain to her in any convenient 
oratory within the manor of Unerigg. The Thwaitefes afterwards became 
owners thereof, from whom it came to the Chriftians, and it is now the pro-

The other moiety came to the Muttons, and was given by Thomas de Multon 
in the reign of king Henry the third to the abbey of Caldre; and after 
the diffolution of the monafteries, queen Elizabeth by letters patent bearing

in feveralty. 

The cuftomary tenants of the other moiety pay a four-penny fine certain, 
according to a compofition made with Richard Barwis efquire in 1633.

In the 17 Eliz. 22 June, there is a grant by the faid queen to John Soukey 
and Parcival Gunfon gentlemen, their heirs and affigns, amongft other parti- 
culars, of the grange and vill of Gilcroufe, and all the meffuages, lands, tene- 
ments, water mill, rents, reverfions, and fervices, with the appurtenances, in 
Gilcroufe aforefaid, late in the tenure of William Armftrong, parcel of the 
poffefiions of the late monaftery or priory of Caldre : To hold as of the 
manor of Eaft Greenwich, by fealty only, in free and common focage, and 
not in capite nor by knight's fervice. 

The cuftom of this manor gave rife to a cafe in queen Elizabeth's time, in 
a caufe in chancery, wherein Dawfon and other tenants of the faid manor were 
plaintiffs, and Armftrong (lord of the faid manor) and Dykes were de- 
fendants. Which was as follows : Whereas upon hearing of counfel for the 
plaintiffs and defendants in the faid court, 18 May, 38 Eliz. touching the 
cuftom pretended by the faid Armftrong, that upon every change of a lord 
(although the change grew by his own act, and that daily) the plaintiffs fhould 
pay arbitrable fines at the lord's will, the lord keeper conceived in his own 
opinion, that the faid pretended cuftom was unreafonable and againft law. 
And therefore it was ordered that a cafe fhould be made, and the judges 
opinions had for the law touching that pretended cuftom. And, whereas by 
another order of the 2d of June, 39 Eliz. it appeared that her majefty's 
attorney general had drawn a cafe upon the faid pretended cuftom, which the 
lord keeper having fubfcribed, the faid cafe was by his lordfhip referred to the 
confideration of the lord chief juftice Popham, who on conference with 
Anderfon, Periam, Walmefley, and all the judges of Serjeant's Inn, made 
his report, that he himfelf and the reft of the faid judges were of opinion, 
that the cuftom upon alienation or death of the tenant, or upon death of the 
lord, might ftand with reafon â€¢, but the cuftom to take fines upon every alie- 
nation of the lord they thought unreafonable and unlawful. â€” Note, This is 
the fame cafe with that quoted in the margin of Coke's 1 Inft. p. 59. b. though 
the names of the manor and county are there miftaken or mifprinted. 

The faid family of Dykes are ftill lords of the manor : only the vicar has 
about fix tenants, who pay 12 s rent, and a two-penny fine upon death or 
alienation. 

In 1334* Sir John Leftcfon of Penreth, prieft, was collated to this vicarage 
by bifhop Kirkby. 

In 1368, bifhop Strickland fet out and appointed an endowment for the 
vicar as followeth : That the vicar fhall have the manfion houfe oppofite to the

half of the tithe hay, and all the tithes of wool, lamb, milk, mills, fifhings,

tithes ; and that the abbot and convent of Caldre fhall pay moreover to the 
vicar four marks yearly. The vicar to bear all charges ordinary and extraor- 
dinary, except the repair of the chancel *.

PARISH OF PLUMLAND. 

The pariih of Plumland lies eaft from Gilcrux, and is bounded by Gil- 
crux beck on the weft, by the river Elne on the north, by Threapland gill on 
the eaft, and from the head of Threapland gill along the horfe courfe to the 
top of Moothay on the fouth. 

The firft townlhip or manor in this parilh is Wardhole, corruptly Wardale 
or Warthole, being the place where watch and ward ufed to be kept in 
former times when the Scots made their inroads into Cumberland, from 
whence the watchmen gave warning to them who attended at the beacon on 
Moothay to fire the fame. , It is a fmall manor, but hath a large demefne, and 
belonged formerly to the abbey of Caldre, and is now the property of the 
family of Dykes, who came at firft from Dykesfleld in Burgh barony, from 
whence they took their name.

Arcleby is another place in this parifh, which gave name to an ancient 
family, as appears in many old deeds, in feveral of which Hugh de Arcleby 
and John de Arcleby are named as witneffes. But the Martindales of Newton 
marrying the inheritrix, it continued in that family until Roger Martindale 
forfeited the fame by treafon as is aforefaid. Whereupon queen Elizabeth 
granted it to Sir John Penruddock, father of Robert, whofe fon Sir John 
Penruddock was beheaded at Salifbury by the commonwealth party together 
with Colonel Grove in 1652. It was afterwards fold to Guftavus Thompfon, 
M. A. then re<5tor of the faid parifh, whofe fon Guftavus Thompfon efquire 
built a good houfe there, and fettled the fame upon his wife who now 
enjoys it. 

There is another little manor within this parifh called Parsonby, or the 
Parfon's town ; which is holden of the rector for the time being : and confifts 
of about ten tenants, who pay 3 /yearly rent at Whitfuntide and Martinmafs by

The tenants of this manor are all cuftomary, and pay arbitrary fines, heriots, 
and ufual boons and fervices to the capital meffuage at High Clofe. The 
ancient demefne belonging to this manor is called the Mains, and lies lower 
caftward towards Elne. 

The church ftands near the middle of the parifh, upon an afcent. It is 
re&orial, and valued in the king's books at 20/ 14s g\d. It hath glebe-land 
to the amount of about 72 acres, and the whole revenue is now of the value 
of 140 or 1 50 / per annum. 

It is dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and now in the patronage of the duke of 
Portland, who purchafed the fame of Adam Afkew efquire phyfician at New- 
caftle upon Tyne, who purchafed from the heirs general of the late Sir 
Wilfrid Lawfon of Ifel, who had it from the Thompfons, and they from the

In the year 13 10, on the death of Sir Walter de Aencourt rector of Plum- 
land, Mr. Peter de Aencourt was prefented by Robert de Gofcford, who claimed 
the right of patronage for that turn as next of kindred to Ralph de Aencourt 
(fon of Ralph) the infant proprietor of the lands of Appilthvvait to which the 
advowfon of this rectory was appendant. Thefe fuggeftions, by commif- 
fioners and an inqueft de jure patronatus, are found to be true, and Peter de 
Aencourt was thereupon inftituted and inducted. Soon after, Robert de 
Waddlehoufe brought another prefentation from the king. But on a fecond 
commiffion it appeared that the laid Peter was lawful incumbent, and that the 
late Ralph de Aencourt deceafed never held any lands of the king in capite. 

In 1358, Adam de Eajfenthwc.it was rector, who gave by his will half a mark 
towards repairing the church, and delineating the picture of St. Cuthbert.

In 1628, inliitution was given to Mr. Lancelot Fletcher, prefented by 
Jofeph Porter of Bridekirk efquire, notwithstanding a caveat entered by 
Richard Skelton gentleman : This MY. Fletcher was living in 1643, being in

Blenerhasset is the next townmip within this parifh, a mile eaft from 
Threapland, and ftands upon the river Elne. This was parcel of Allerdale, 
which Alan the fecond lord thereof gave to Ranulph de Lindfey with his fitter

8. Sir Peter de Tilliol, fon of Robert, was fheriff in the 11 and 18 Ric. 2.

Sir Henry Knevet. And, 3. To John Vaughan efquire. 

Vol. II. R Accordingly, 



122 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Blenerhasset.) 

Accordingly, in the 35 Hen. 8. it is found by an inquifirion of knights fees 
in Cumberland, that Henry Knevet and Anne his wife then held the manor 
of Torpenhow ; but (he had before fold the manor of BlenerhafTet, for at the 
fame time we find that Thomas Salkeld of Whitehall held the manor of Ble- 
nerhafTet of the king in capite, by the fervice of a third part of one knight's 
fee, 12 s cornage, 6'd leawake, and puture of the ferjeants. 

This 'Thomas Salkeld was defcended from a younger brother of the houfe of 
Corby, and married Mary daughter of William Vaux of Caterlen : By whom 
he had ifTue, 

Lancelot Salkeld efquire ; who married Elizabeth daughter and coheir of 
Nicholas Berdefey of Berdefey in the county of Lancafter efquire ; and by 
her had ifTue, 

Thomas Salkeld efquire ; who by his wife Mary Copeland had a fon and 
heir, viz. 

Lancelot Salkeld efquire â€¢, who married Dorothy daughter of Alan Afkeugh 
of Skeughfby in Yorkshire efquire by whom he had ifTue, Francis, Lancelot, 
Mary, Margaret married to Green, Elizabeth married to Richardfon, and 
Agnes married to Mr. Thomas Patrickfon. 

Sir Francis Salkeld knight, fon and heir of Lancelot, married Anne the 
cldeft daughter of Walter Strickland efquire, by whom he had ifTue, 

Thomas Salkeld efquire, who had three fons and eight daughters, viz. 
Thomas, Lancelot killed in Ireland, Roger, Margaret married to Edward 
Charleton of HafTelfide in the county of Northumberland efquire, Anne and 
Catherine nuns, Frances married to John Thirlwall efquire, Dorothy, Mary, 
Elizabeth, and Barbara. 

Of thefe, Thomas Salkeld efquire, eldcft fon of the laft Thomas, had ifTue 
Thomas and Henry. Thomas died unmarried, and was fucceeded by his 
brother Henry. Which Henry was bred a phyfician, and pracTifed fome years 
at York with great reputation ; but on the death of his elder brother, he left 
York, and married a daughter of the aforefaid Edward Charleton of HafTel- 
fide â– , and, dying without ifTue, left his eftate (much incumbered) to his laid 
wife, who died at Whitehall in 1769. 

The tenants of this manor, though it is very fmall in compafs, and although 
they are only about 20 in number, yet pay an annual ancient rent of 23/, and 
arbitrary fines, and alfo heriots as well upon the widows death as death of the 
tenant, and feveral boons and fervices, namely, one day mowing, fhearing, 
ploughing, meadows dreffing, and two days leading coals. 

Kirkland, fo called from having belonged to the church, was, in fetting 
out the refpeclive proportions of the revenues between the rector and vicar, 
afTigned to the priorefs and convent of RofTdale as rectors, and after the 
diffolution of the monafteries was granted to the Salkelds of Whitehall. 
The tenants here have an extraordinary kind of tenure, namely, by leafe 
granted to them generally by Mr. Lancelot Salkeld father of Sir Francis for 
999 years, paying a certain yearly rent for every tenement amounting in the 
1 whole 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Kirkland.) 123 

whole to 6/ 15J 1 d yearly, and every twenty-one years they are to pay a fine 
to the lord, viz. a twenty-penny fine, which they call a running greffom, and 
then take new leafes, but pay no general fine upon the lord's death nor 
upon change of tenant, but they pay an heriot upon the death of every 
tenant. 

Bothil is the next townfhip in this parifh, ftanding half a mile higher weft 
than Kirkland. This was demefne of Allerdale until Waldeof lord of Aller- 
dale gave it to Gamel fon of Brun in king Henry the firft's time, whofe 
pofterity long enjoyed the fame in the iflue male. His father's chief manfion 
was at Brunfkeugh in the manor of Linftock near the waftes, whereupon 
Radulph fon of Gamel was called Radulph de Feritate, Ralph of the Waftes, 
and fo his foia Robert de Feritate. They were lords of Beaumont, Glaffon, 
Drumbugh, and Bownefs ; which they held of the lord of Burgh in the 
reign of Hen. 3, Richard Brun was lord of Bothil and of the fixth part of 
Torpenhow in Edward the fuft's time, and Robert Brun in the reign of 
Edward the third. 

Afterwards Bothil and the Bruns' lands fell to three coheirs, married to 
Nicholas Harrington brother to the lord of Harrington, to William Culwen 
of Workington, and to Thomas Bovvet. 

To Nicholas Harrington fucceeded James Harrington, who died in the 
5 Hen, 5. After him, Sir Richard Harrington, who died in the 7 Ed. 4. 
Nicholas his fon fold it to Thomas lord Dacre, who exchanged it and Warnel 
with John Denton efquire for Denton hall and the manor of Denton in 
Gilfland in the 12 Hen. 7. whofe fon Thomas fucceeded to this inheritance, 
and fo did three more of the name of Thomas fucceffively, the laft of whom 
in the 22 C, 2, fold Bothil park to Sir Francis Salkeld, and the remainder of 
that demefne to other inhabitants of Bothil -, and the old rent of 4/ 19J, with 
the feigniory, to captain Anthony Wilkes. 

To Culwen's part the heirs of Workington fucceeded, until Sir Henry 
Curwen father of Sir Nicholas fold it to Anthony Barwife of IQekirk efquire, 
who fettled it upon a daughter married to a fecond fon of the Eglesfields ; 
which Eglesfielu dying without iflue, Richard Denton a third brother of the 
fecond named Thomas married her, to whom fhe had iflue Edward Denton, 
who fold the reverfion thereof (after his and his wife's death) to the Salkelds 
of Threapland, and it is now poffeffed by the owners of that eftate. 

Bowel's part was by fine levied 8 Ed. 4. fold by Sir Nicholas Bowet knight, 
grandfon of the aforefaid Thomas, to William Ellis ; whofe grandfon Bernard 
Ellis efquire recorder of York fold the fame to feveral of the inhabitants. 

The town ftands on the fide of an hill, where in old time the watch was 
kept day and night for feawake, which fervice was performed by the country 
beneath Derwent at this place ; and above Derwent, in Copeland, at Bothil 
in Milium. It is called fervicifim de bcdis in old evidences, whereupon this hill 
was named the bode-hilly and the village at the foot of it Bode-hill-ton (Bolton), 
or Bodorum Collis. The common people ufed to call a lantern a bowet, which 
name and word was then in ufe for a light on the fhore to direct failors in 

R 2 the

the night, properly fignifying a token, and not a light or lantern, as they call 
a melTage warranted by a token a bodeword, and the watchmen were called 
bode/men, becaufe they had a bode or watchword given them, to prevent the 
enemy's fraud in the night feafon. 

Torpenhow ftands about a mile eaft from Bothil, upon the fame level, 
and was an ancient demefne of the barony of Allerdale, until Alan fon of 
Waldeof gave the fame with Gunild his fifter to Ugthred fon of Fergus lord 
of Galloway, to be holden by him and his heirs by homage, cornage, and 
other fervices. In king Henry the fecond's time, Philip de Valoniis held the 
fame in right of his wife, who held the fame of Reginald Lucy and Amabil 
bis wife lord of the moiety of Allerdale. In king John's time, Robert 
Eftotevil brother to the lord Nicholas Eftotevil lord of Liddale held it. And 
in the 31 Hen. 3. William fon of William de Ulfby gave three carucates of 
land there to Robert de Mulcaftre, and held five parts of the fame of Richard 
Brun : the other fixth part, which he joined to the manor of Bothil, he held 
of the lord of Liddale heir to Eftotevil. The faid five parts defcended to the 
Mulcaftres, and from them to the Tilliolls ; one of whofe coheirs transferred 
the fame _to the Morefbys. The heir general of Morefby was married to 
Wefton, Knevet, and Vaughan. Accordingly, in the 35 Hen. 8. it is found, 
that Henry Knevet and Anne his wife, in right of the faid Anne, held 
the manor and town of Torpenhow of the king in capite, by the fervice 
of 24 s cornage, 6^d feawake, and puture of the ferjeants. Arterwaids her 
third hufband Vaughan joined with her in levying a fine and thereby conveyed 
the manor of Torpenhow unto Thomas Salkeld and John Appleby. Which 
John Appleby, being employed by the faid Mr. Salkeld to go into the county 
of Durham to make the contract with the lady Knevet and her hufband 
Vaughan, Appleby very unworthily made himfelf joint purchafer. So they 
came to a divifion, and Appleby got the part which lies without the park 
wall, which Anthony Appleby fon of Thomas fon of the faid joint purchafer 
fold to Sir George Fletcher, and the tenants of the cuftomary lands he fold to 
Lancelot Salkeld fon of Thomas in the 12 Eliz. Thomas Salkeld had the 
fetgrivorf and all the other cuftomary tenants, the park, and miln ; which 
defcended in the family of Salkeld, in like manner as did Blenerhaffet, ac- 
cording as in the pedigree is above fet forth. 

It is called Tcr --pen-how, every fyllable of which word, in the feveral lan- 
guages of the people which fucceffively did inhabit the place, doth fignify 
after a manner one thing. The Britons firft called a little rifing hill there 
Pen. The Saxons, next fucceeding, not well underftnnding the fignification 
of pen, called it Tor-pen, the pinacle pen. The laft, as we do yet, called it 
Tcr-pen-how, the how or hill 'T'orpen. â€” Others have thought it fo named upon 
this occafion : The Saxons call a village Dorp, and finding the hill there to be 
named of the Britons pen, a head or hill top, they called it 'Thorp pen, or the 
town hill. 

The cuftomary tenants of this manor pay arbitrary fines. 

Whiterigg 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (WhIterigg.) 125 

Whiterigg is the next village, which ftands half a mile fouth from Tor- 
penhow, upon the height of that hill. This is a little manor belonging to 
Sir Gilfrid Lawfon, part of the Ifel eftate -, which they purchafed about the 
year 1712 of the Skeltons of Armathwaite, whofe anceftors had it by a 
marriage with the Colvills, who married one of the coheirs of Tillioll. The 
demefne is pretty large, and there are about eight freehold tenants, and one 
cuftomary who pays 13 s rent and a twenty-penny fine. 

Bowaldeth lies a mile fouth on the back of Binfel fell, which is the 
higheft mountain in this tract. It is a little manor, which was granted by 
Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale to Gilmin ; whofe pofterity, refiding at Bothill, 
took the name of Bo wet. 

Afterwards, Alice de Romeley daughter of William Fitz Duncan had it ; 
who by deed without date granted to John de Utterfield the whole vill of 
Bualdeth, by the boundaries in the grant particularly fpecified ; together w?th 
common of pafture for him and all his tenants of Bualdeth for all their cattle 
to feed from the water Elne to the eaft, to Threapland beck on the welt. 

After him, the Mulcaftres had it for feveral defcents. In the 2 Ed. 1. 
Robert de Mulcaftre granted by fine to his fon Walter de Muhaftre the manors 
of Bowaldeth, Bolton, Torpenhow, and Blenerhaflet. And in the 2 Hen. 4. 
Robert de Mulcaftre granted to Robert de Highmore the vill of Bowaldeth, with, 
the water mill, and a moiety of the profits of the foldage of divers cattle 
upon the moor adjoining. Witneffes of which grant were, William de Legh 
knight, William de Lowther then fherifF of Cumberland, John de Skekon,. 
William de Ofmotherley, William de Dykes, and others. 

And in this family it continued for the greatefl: part of 400 years, until Mr. 
Benfon Highmore fon of Charles Highmore efquire late of Armathwaite fold the 
fame to James Spedding efquire the prefent owner. 

Here is a fmall demefne called Burthwaite, lying round a copt hill adjoin- 
ing to Ifel old park. The tenants are about thirteen, and their tenements all 
freehold. 

The church of Torpenhow is dedicated to St. Michael ; and was granted 
by Sibilla de Valoniis in her widowhood and by Euftachius de Stutevil fon 
of Robert, to the priorefs and nuns of Roffdale in Cleveland in the county of 
York â€¢, which grants were confirmed to them by king Edward the third-j-. 

And the faid priorefs and nuns having the right of advowfon, bifhop Irton 
in the year 1290, in an ordinance for the endowment of the vicarage, firft 
awards to himfclf the faid right of advowfon, and then ordains, that the vicar 
mail keep in his houfe and maintain at his own charge three priefts and one 
fubdeacon, one of the faid priefts to afnrt the vicar in all parochial offices,.

vicar alfo to bear all ordinary charges, and to be anfwerable foj: the defects of the 
books and ornaments, and the repairs of the chancel, fo as fuch repairs do not

alfo of Bothil and Bknerhaffet ; and the aforefaid houfe excepted out of the 
vicar's fhare : Paying out of the whole to the vicar yearly two marks, and 
difcharging all burdens extraordinary. 

In 1903, Sir Roger Peytenin was collated to the vicarage of Thorppenhow 
by bifhop Kirkby. And fome years after, the faid Roger being convened 
before the bifhop and his official (with other aifeffors) for fubtraction of the 
chantry by him made in his church aforefaid â€¢, on hearing the whole matter, 
the vicar bound himfelf by oath to maintain three priefts and a fubdeacon or 
fome other clerk, fo long as he fhould continue vicar there. 

In 1316, on the death of Roger Peytenin, the bifhop collates Sir Robert de 
Halogton to the vicarage of Thorpenhowe. 

In 1423. the faid Robert having accepted a moiety of the rectory of Ake- 
ton, Sir Alan de Horncoftle is collated to Torpenhow. 

In 1352, a citation iffucd againft Alan de Ribton (a layman), to appear 
in the church of Dalfton, to fhew caufe why the canonical cenfures fhall not 
be paffed on him, for his farming the church of Torpenhow, contrary to the 
conftitutions of the lords Otho and Othobon the pope's legates. 

In 1359, Sir Peter de Morland, vicar of Torpenhowe, changes his living 
with Sir Thomas de Salkeld rector of Clifton. Which Sir Peter was collated to 
the vicarage of Torpenhow in 1355, upon an exchange he made with Sir 
Thomas Roland of the church of Dittenfel (or Dittinfdale, in Northumberland) 
in the diocefe of Durham. 

In 1 37 1, Sir Thomas de Enghale, vicar of Torpenhow, changes with Sir 
Robert de Byx, rector of Wardley in the diocefe of Lincoln.

Ma/on chaplain to the faid vicarage, with the charge of perfonal refidence, 
according to the form of the coniiitution of the Jegate in that cafe made 
and provided. 

In 1393, John de Carlel appears to have been vicar of Torpenhow, having 
brought an action in that year for an houfe in Carlifle. 

After the diffoluti< n of the religious houfes and chantries, queen Elizabeth 
in the 5th year of her reign, 1562, by letters patent, grants to Ciceley Pick- 
ercil of the city of Norwich widow, late wife of John Pickerell gentleman, 
(amongft other particulars) all the tithes of corn and grain yearly, iffuing out

Bewaidcth, Whitrigge, Snittilgarth, and Alderfkewgh, heretofore afligned 
for the fuitentation of a pried: and others celebrating divine offices within the 
parifh chinch of Torpenhow. â€” This Teems to have been a grant of a fmali 
part only. For in the 17 El. there is a larger grant to John Soukey and 
Parcivall Gunfon of all the tithes of corn and hay renewing and iffuing out of 
the towns, lands, fields, or other hereditaments, in Threapland, Alderfkewe,

There is a school at Bothil in this parifh, which had a fmall parcel of land 
belonging to it time out of mind. The firft benefactor within memory was Mr. 
Salkeld. of Threapland, who by will charged his cftate there with the payment 
of 50 s yearly to the faid fchool. Richard Smithfon of Bothiil by willdevifed 
four acres of land at Bothiil to the fame ufe. The panfhionersof Torpenhow, 
encouraged by thefe bequefts, made in the year i 686 a voluntary fubicription 
which amounted to about 42/, for augmenting the filary of the mafter; and 
in the year following it was reiolved by the vicar and fixteen men (or felect 
veftry) that the faid fchool fhould be a free fchool for the whole parifh ; that 
the mafters fucceffively mould be preftnted to the faid f, hool by the vicar

of the faid 16 men. The fubfcription money was laid out in land. And one 
Watfon of Whitehaven (but born at Bothil) about the year 1737 left 10/ to 
this fchool, which is lent out at intereft. The whole revenue is about ill 
a year. 

PARISH OF I R E B Y. 

"Next unto the parifh of Torpenhow is the parifh of Ireby; which is 
bounded on the north eaft fide of the river Elne, from the foot of Newbiggin 
demefne up to the head of the ftanding lake called Orr water, and thence to 
the top of Binfell fell on the fouth, and fo to the head of the fpring which 
falls down by Snittlegarth called Weft Scawbeck to the foot thereof where it 
falls into Elne on the north-weft. There are in this parifh about 70 families; 
whereof quakers 2, papift 1. This is the place which from the affinity of 
names Mr. Camden fuppofes to be the Arbeia of the Romans, but Mr. Horfiey 
fays that there are no footfteps of any Roman ftation having been at this place, 
nor any Roman antiquities have ever been found there that he could hear of, 
and (with more probability) fuppofes that ftation to have been at Morefby. 

Ireby hath been divided into two parts more early than we have any ac- 
count-, viz. High Ireby, called in old evidences Ireby aha, becaufe it ftands 
higher-, and Ireby bajja, or the lower Ireby, which is now alfo called Market 
Ireby. 

High Irfby was granted by Alan fecond lord of Allerdale to Gofpatric fon 
of Orme, lord of" Seaton and Workington-, which Gofpatric gave it to a 
younger fon Orme, who was thereupon called Orme de Ireby, and from him the 
Irebys took their furname. Robert de Courtney and Alice his wife, one of 
the daughters and coheirs of William Fitz Duncan lord of Allerdale gave to 
this Orme de Ireby his manor of Embleton in Richard the firft's time; and 
he had alfo lands in Waverron. 

He had iffue Adam his heir, and William a prieft who gave lands in Gilcrux 
to the abbot of Holme. 

Adam had Thomas his heir, and William lord of Gamelfby and Glaffonby, 
and Alan father of Ifaac who gave his dwelling-houfe in Ireby called Ifaacby 
to the priory of CarHfle. 

Thomas 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Ireby.) it 9 

Thomas had iflue John ; and he, Thomas father of William, who by Chriftian 
his wife had iflue two daughters coheirs, Chriftian and Eva. Eva had a rent 
charge out of the lands, and was married to Robert d'Eftotevill, and after to 
Alan de Charters. She releafed her purparty to her fitter Chriftian wife of 
Thomas Lafcells of Bolton, who had iflue Armina Lafcells married to John 
Seaton, whofe fon Chriftopher Seaton was attainted in Edward the firft's time r 
for taking part with Robert Bruce and the Scots. 

After this we find at Ireby one John de Ireby who was fheriff" of the county 
in the 12 Ric. 2. And alfo in the 15th and 19th of the fame king's reign; and 
knight of the (hire in parliament in 8, 11, and 20 Ric. 2. And this is the laft, 
of the name that hath occurred at Ireby. 

In after times, this manor belonged to the Barwifes, who fold to one of the 
Fletchers, whofe defcendent Walter Fletcher now enjoys the fame, together with 
Ruthwait. 

The tenants in High Ireby and K uthwait are about 20 in number ; pay to 
the faid Mr. Fletcher 14/ 11 s 6d cuftomary rent, arbitrary fines, and each 
tenant one boon day or 3 d. 

Low Ireby, called alfo Market Ireby, lies a mile lower, north eaft from 
High Ireby. It came to the Ballentines (in a female heir of which family it 
now continues) by marriage of Anne eldeft daughter of William Mufgrave of 
Crookdake, whofe anceftor William Mufgrave married a daughter and coheir 
of William Colvil, whofe father John Colvil married a filler and coheir of Robert 
fon of Peter de Tilliol, which Peter de Tilliol had this manor from Thomas 
Middleton, fon of Peter, fon of Adam, who married Chriftian daughter of Wil- 
liam de Ireby. She held it of William Boyvil of Thurfby knight, who was fon 
of Guido Boyvil, who married Clerota the heir general of the Thurfbys, whofe 
anceftor Herbert de Thurjby held it as an afiart in the foreft of Weftward, and 
rented it of the king. William de Ireby, father of Chriftian, was but a younger 
brother, but advanced by king John to far better eftate than his elder brother, 
and made knight, and preferred to the marriage of Odard's daughter and heir 
of Glafionby and Gamelfby then the king's ward. 

In the account of knights fees in Cumberland, 35 Hen. 8. it appears, that 
Cuthbert Mufgrave fon of Mungo held a moiety of the manor and vill of Low 
Ireby of the king as of his manor of Papcaftre, by the fervice of 2s $d corn- 
age, 6 d feawake, puture of the ferjeants, and witnefman in Allerdale. And 
William Mufgrave fon of Thomas held in like manner the other moiety. 

The cuftomary tenants of this manor purchafed their tenements to freehold 
of the two laft owners of the name of Ballentine. 

Here is a weekly market on Thurfday, and two fairs yearly on the feafts of 
St. Matthias and St. Matthew. 

The church of Ireby was given by Alan fecond lord of Allerdale to the prior 
and convent of Carlifle â€¢, which grant was confirmed by king Hen 2. and king 
Ed. 3 *.

It ftill continues in the hands of the dean and chapter, who appoint the cu- 
rate, and require their leffee of the rectory to pay him 25/ a year, which is his 
whole falary; all forts of tithes and dues belonging to the faid leffee. 

On a tomb ftone on the fouth fide of the chancel is this inlcription, 

George Crage of Prior-hall gent. 
Who faithfully ferved queen Elizabeth, 
king James, prince Henry, and Charles 
king of England. 1626. 

A fchool was founded here in 1726, for teaching the poor children of the 
parifh to read and write, by one Matthew Caldbeck of Ruihwait, who gave 
100/, the intereft whereof is paid to the mafter. 

PARISH OF ULDALE. 

Uldale (Ulndale) lies oppofite to Ruthwait on the eaft fide of Elne river, 
and is fo named from that river, which runs through the upper end of the 
parifh, its chief fountains fpringing from the top of Coppeak and Caldfell, 
which are parted from Skiddaw mountain by Whitewater Dafb. 

It is diverfely named in old evidences Elne, Alne, and Olne. And the parifh 
is bounded by the fame from Ireby bridge to the head of Orr water, and from 
thence by the ring dyke of Whitefield to the north end of Baffenthwaite park, 
and fo down the park hedge to White Water, and then up that water to the 
head thereof above White Water Dafli, and fo pointing northward along the 
back of Coppeak and Caldfell, and then from the top of Caldfell down by a 
rill that falls by Bleaberrythwait, and the weft end of Greenrigg to the head 
of Awhatree beck, and fo down that beck to Ireby bridge. 

The parifh is long and narrow, being (trait laced by the mountains on the 
eaft and Elne on the weft, and extending itfelf from fouth to north above four 
miles in length, though it be not a mile in breadth any where. There are 
in it about 50 families, one only diffenter being a quaker. 

It is remarkable, that this parifh in two years time rebuilt their church, 
built a fchool and endowed it with 200/, and purchafed their eftates to free- 
hold, and yet were left in good circumftances, and are now mod of them fub- 
ftantial freeholders. 

This parifh and manor (parcel of the barony of Allerdale) Waldeof gave 
to Adam fon of Lyolf, broiher of Phorn, fon of Lyolf baron of Grayftock, 
together with the manor of Gilcrux, from which Adam they defcended by a 
daughter to the Bonekills, who granted Gilcrux to a younger brother Robert 
Bonekill ; and the fons of the faid Robert, Thomas Bonekill and Walter gave 
away their inheritance in Gilcrux to the abbey of Galdre, which Sir Ranulph 
Bonekill knight (then lord paramount both of Uldale and Gilcrux) confirmed. 
Sir Ranulph had iffue Alexander, who had lffue Adam, which Adam gave 
Awerthwaite, (now Awhatree) parcel of his manor of Uldale to the priory of 
Carlifle. The faid Adam had iffue another Alexander Bonekill ; whofe daugh-

ter and heir, firft married to John Stewart kinfman to the king of Scots, and 
afterwards to David Brigham a Scotifh knight of great valour, transferred the 
inheritance to the family of Brigham. This David Brigham was a companion 
of William Wallace that was executed at London for treafon committed againft 
Edward the firft, by refilling that king's attempt for the fuperiority of Scot- 
land and the Baliol's right to the crown of Scotland, taking part with Robert 
Bruce. Wallace was a man of extraordinary ftrength, and David Brigham 
an exceeding good horfeman, whereupon the Scots made this rythme, 

The man was ne'er fo wight nor geud, 

But worthy Wallace durft him bide; 
Nor ever horfe fo wild or weud, 

But David Brigham durft him ride. 

David Brigham thereby forfeited his eftate to Anthony lord Lucy then lord 
of Allerdale.' So Uldale efcheated, and became again parcel of that ancient 
barony, and the manor extinguifhed of right; yet was it continued as a manor 
by the Lucys pofterity and the Percys earls of Northumberland until Henry 
the fixth earl of Northumberland gave the inheritance of this manor to king 
Henry the eighth. 

Which king, by letters patent bearing date July 15, in the 35th year of his 
reign, granted to Thomas Dalfton efquire (together with divers other pofief- 
fions) the manor of Uldale, late parcel of the poflefilons of Henry Percy de- 
ceaied late earl of Northumberland ; paying to the king for Uldale yearly 

47 s &<*â€¢ 

Which Thomas Dalfton, by fine levied in the 37 Hen. 8. fettled the fame 

upon himfelf and his (fecond) wife Eleanor for life, remainder to his fon 
Ckrijlopher Daljton (by his faid fecond wife) and the heirs of his body, remain- 
der to his own right heirs. Which Chriftopher Dalfton was anceftor of the 
Dalftons of Acorn Bank in Weftmorland, in which family this manor of Ul- 
dale ftill continues. 

Awhatree lies half a mile north beyond the common field of Uldale, upon 
the edge of Sandall. And though this townfhip was granted to the prior of 
Carlifle by Adam Bonekill as beforementioned, yet the priory being diflblved 
at the time of the grant to Thomas Dalfton, and the whole manor of Uldale 
being granted to him, Awhatree pafied by that grant. 

The church of Uldale is fituate at the weft end of the parifh near tolreby. 
It is rectorial ; and the patronage thereof is appendant to the manor. It is va- 
lued in the king's books at 17/ i8i i-^d, and the prefent yearly value is 
about 70/. 

In the year 1305, on the death of Sir Robert de Depyng rector of Ulnedale, 
Sir David de Bryghyn (Brigham) knight prefented Hugh de Rouceftre clerk, 
and Thomas de Lucy prefented one Sir David de Cringledike chaplain, where- 
by the church became litigious. And an inquifition thereupon was taken by 
the clergy of the deanry of Allerdale at Wigton in the chapter held there July 
20th in that year ; and the return thereon was thus :

" The jurors fay, that the faid church is void, and hath been void from the 
" feaft of St. Dunftan laft pafl, by the death of Sir Robert de Depyng late 
Â«' rector of the faid church : And they fay, that Sir Alexander de Bonkill laft 
" prefented the faid Sir Robert to the faid church : That it is worth communi- 
** bus annis 18/ a year. Alfo they fay, that the faid Sir Alexander had a 
" daughter Margaret, who is now lately dead, and that in her father's life- 
" time fhe was manied to Sir John brother of the Steward of Scotland, to 
Â« whom (he had children (as is faid)-, and fo it feemeth to them, that the 
" eldeft fon of the faid John and Margaret ought of right to be the true pa- 
" tron thereof : But that the church is litigious, for that Thomas de Lucy 
" hath prefented Sir David a chaplain, a man fufficiently known, honeft, and 
" of good behaviour, to the faid church â€¢, which prefentee aliens the right of 
" presentation for that turn to belong to the faid Thomas, becaufe the manor 
" of Ulnedale is in his hand by reafon of the death of the faid Margaret 
" daughter and heir of the faid Alexander, who held the faid manor with the 
" appurtenances of the faid Thomas de Lucy by the fervice of cornage, which 
" yields wardfhip and relief-, and that Sir David de Breghyn, who now pre- 
â€¢* fents the faid Hugh to the faid church was never married to the faid Mar- 
" garet in the face of the church. The faid Hugh in like manner propounds, 
*' that the faid Sir David de Breghyn is patron and ought to prefent to the 
" fame by the law and cuftom of England, for that he did marry the faid 
â€¢* Margaret, and during the marriage had children by her: In evidence where- 
â€¢* of he produced certain letters and tranfcripts of the bifhops of St. Andrews, 
â€¢' Dunkeld, and Brekyn, and the tranfcript of a bull of the late pope Bene- 
'* diet of blefied memory, under the feals of the archdeacon of St. Andrews, 
**- and the official of Brekyn, by which it appears, that notwithstanding the 
â€¢Â» affinity and confanguinity between the faid Sir David and Margaret, the 
â– * faid pope Benedict difpenfed that they might marry. Of the condition of 
H the laid Hugh, as to his birth, they know nothing: And that he is an 
** Acolyte, and otherwife of good behaviour, as they believe. Other things 

â€¢* touching the faid inquifition they leave to your fatherly goodnefs." About 

Michaelmafs following, the faid Thomas de Lucy prefented another clerk, one 
Sir Adam de Eglesfield, whereupon a fecond inquifition was taken, and a return 
made thereon to the fame purpofe as the foregoing. It is probable this Adam 
was inftituted, though in this particular the regifter book is defecYive. 

Jn 1336, Sir Hugh rector of Ulnedale had a difpenlation granted him for 
one year's abfence from his cure; the reafon thereof being thus affigned in 
the preamble â€” Quum in curia domini noftri regis diverfis negotiis implicatus 
exiftis, circa quorum expeditionem oportet te perfonaliter intendere et vacare. 

In 1354, Sir Richard de AJkeby, rector of Uldale, in confideration of the 
diftance of the parifhioners from their parifh church, had a licence from bifhop 
Welton, for one year, to perform divine fervice in the chapel in the village of 
Ulnedale; which licence doth not appear to have been afterwards renewed. In 
1361, the fame Sir Richard had a difpenfation of abfence, by reafon of his 
attendance on Thomas de Lucy.

In the year 176, a school was founded at Uldale, and endowed with 200/ 
as is before mentioned; of which, 51/ 10s od is laid out in land, and the 
remainder is in the hands of the (tvai truftees. 

PARISH OF CALDBECK. 

Caldbeck. lies eaft from Uldale four miles, and was long after the con- 
queft watte foreft ground parcel of Allerdale, and is bounded by the riv^r of 
Caldew where Caldbeck falls into it at the foot of Hefket demefne unto the 
head thereof on the eaft fide of Coppake as the water falls each way, from 
thence to the top of Caldfell, and fo by a rill which falls down from Burble- 
thwaite and the weft end of Greenrigg to the head of Awhatree beck*, then 
turning northwards to Thorny ftone, and along a path-way till it come to 
Thiftle bottom, and from thence up to the Rayes head, and fo down to Shawk 

head, 



, 34 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Caldbeck.) 

head, and then turning downwards to the Brandreth ftone, then by the height 
to the head of Brackley beck, and down the fame till it fall into Caldbeck above 
the bridge. 

This is the laft parilh in this ward that lies under the fkirts of the moun- 
tains. It runs from weft to eaft in length above {even miles, from the Thorny 
{lone to the head of Moffdale, being hemmed in on the fouth fide by a ridge 
of mountains called Caldfell, Caldbeck fells, Noon fell, and Carrock ; and 
on the north, by a lower tract of hills running to Warnel fell. 

This parilh was firft fo named from the beck which runs through the middle 
of it, and fprings from Caldfell ; which, meeting with the river Caldew (Cold- 
water) coming down from the north fide of Skiddaw, lofeth its name of Cald- 
beck, and keeps the name of Caldew till it falls into Eden below Carlifle. 
And it juftly receives this name, being fed with at lead an hundred cold fprings 
which flow into it from thefe mountains, which are often covered with fnow 
in the winter and fpring feafons. Yet cold as thefe mountains are, they fuf- 
tain large flocks of fheep, which are very profitable to the inhabitants. Alfo 
thefe mountains are replenished with the ore of lead and copper ; infomuch 
that in fome parts thereof the teeth of the fheep are remarkably tinged with a 
gold colour, fuppofed to be by the water iffuing from the veins of copper. 

Out of Weftn.orland and the eaft parts of Cumberland there lying an high- 
way through Caldbeck into the weft of Cumberland, it was anciently very dan- 
gerous for pafTengers to travel through it, who were often robbed by thieves 
that haunted thole woody parts and mountains, thereupon Ranulph Engain, 
the chief forefter of Englewood, granted licence to the prior of Carlifle to 
build an hofpital for the relief of diftreffed travellers who might happen to be 
troubled by thofe thieves, or prejudiced by the fnows or florms in winter. 
Then began the prior to inclofe part of the fame, near to the place where the 
church now ftands, which was ufed as part of the foreft, but the right of the 
foil was in the lord of Allerdale. 

After this hofpital was built, they founded the church here in honour of St. 
Mungo or Kentigern, and the place became fully inhabited; that part which 
lay near the church being higher than the reft was called Caldbeck-Uppeton 
or Uppertown, and that part near the fell was called Caldbeck-Underfell â€¢, 
unto which they have fince added a third divifion, which they call the Eaft end, 
though they have but two conftablewicks in that extenfive parifh. 

The priors had the patronage of the rectory granted to them by Gofpatric 
fon of Orme, which was confirmed by William de Vefcy and Burga his wife, 
and dame Alice de Romeley lady of Allerdale, and alfo by the kings Henry 
the fecond and Edward the third *. They then difTolved the hofpital, and en- 
dowed the church with the lands thereof about king John's time â€¢, which lands, 
as belonging to the church, have fince been called the manor of Kirkland. 

In the fame king's reign, one John Franceys (Francigena) was parfon of 
Caldbeck, and got a great inclofure in Warnel Bank within the foreft of Engle- 

* Ex donO Gofpatricii filii Orme ecclefiam de Caldbeck cum omnibus fibi adjacentibus, et hof- 
pitalem domum de Caldbeck cum omnibus pertinentiis fuis, fecundum quod charts ejufdem Gof-

ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Caldbeck.) 135 

wood, which he joined to the glebe, and is now called the parfon's park. 
Yet the monks of Holme fo quarrelled him, that he was glad to compound 
with them by granting them a mare, which was between the bounds of the 
two fikes of Greigardgill on the weft and Brottholehill on the eaft ; which 
â€¢grant was confirmed not only by the bifhop and his chapter, but by king Henry 
the third in the 1 6th year of his reign. Yet the parfon's fhare was ftill fubject 
to an annual crown rent of one mark, payable into the king's exchequer at 
Michaehmfs. Parkhead is now held in tenancy, under the rector, and feems 
to have been part of the faid inclofure, though it is now held as part of the 
manor of Kirkland aforelaid. 

The prior's fucceffbr Bartholomew granted the advowfon to the bifhop 
(Walter Malclerk) and his fucceiTors, who have ever fince enjoyed it. In the 
52 Hen. 3. Cicely countefs of Albemarle, eldefl: daughter of William Ficz 
Duncan, claimed the right of advowfon againft bifhop Chaufe-, but upon a 
Sluare Impedit the bifhop recovered the right of collation to the church of 
Caldbeck. 

Bin the lords of Allerdale continued to enjoy the feigniory through, the fe- 
veral defcents of the Lucys, till Maud the female heir of that family carried 
the fame to the Percys earls of Northumberland, in whom it remained until 
Henry the fixth earl of Northumberland granted Caldbeck to king Henry the 
eighth â€¢, who fold Caldbeck Uppertown to Thomas Dalfton efquire, and Cald- 
beck Underfell to Thomas lord Wharton, who being warden of the weft 
marches did fo treat Mr. Dalfton, that he was glad to fell Upperton to him: 
And they continued in that family till Philip duke of Wharton, the laft of 
.that family, vefted the fame, together with other eftates, in Mr. Juftice Den- 
ton, Thomas Gibfon, John Jacob, and Robert Jacomb efquires, for the pay- 
ment of his debts ; and Charles late duke of Somerfet becoming purchafer,, 
the prefent earl of Egremont as his reprefemative enjoys the fame. 

Both the Caldbecks were one intire manor in the time of Alice third daugh- 
ter of William Fitz Duncan, to whom the fame was affigned, together with 
the reft of the barony of Allerdale, as her purparty. But after her dying 
without iffue, Caldbeck was divided between her fillers children, the houie of 
Albemarl and the Lucys ; and that brought the divifion of the manor into two 
gravefhips or collections, and the rents and profits were accounted for as of 
two different manors-, but the waftes were not known to be divided. After 
the line of Albemarle was ended, all fell to the Lucys. 

In this parifh there are many villages and townfhips ; as, firft, Greenrigg, which, 
lies next toUldale under Caldfell, and did formerly belong to the Mulgravesof 
Crookdake; who heretofore being officers and commanders under the earls of 
Northumberland, had feveral parcels of wafte ground granted to them for 
their good fervices, which they converted into tenancies. But Sir John Bal- 
lentine, who married Anne the eldefl daughter and coheir of William Muf- 
grave efquire, fold thefe tenants to the lord Wharton ; which tenants pay 
il $s id yearly rent and arbitrary fines : All the other cuftomary tenants pay; 
a ten-penny fine certain by decree. 

Caldfell 



136 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Caldbeck.) 

Caldfell arifeth high above Greenrigg, from the top whereof is Caldfell foun- 
tain, which running down by Park end (where formerly was a red deer park) 
glideth under the Faulds, and fo by Whelpbay and Pategill or Paddegill y and by 
Brownrigg. 

And further down the north fide of this beck lies Ratten Row, where there 
is a coal mine and flate quarry. This hamlet ftretches down to Caldbeck 
bridge, where another ftream meets with Caldbeck, which hath its rife from 
the weft fide of Noon fell, falls down by a little village called Fell/Ide, and fo 
by Hudfcales't and falling from that high hill almoft in a direct courfe, runs 
with a very precipitate current through Uppeton to the Low town or Church 
town, where the rector hath a little manor of about 24 tenants, who pay 7/ 
17J \d cuftomary rent, arbitrary fines upon an alienation, but a Gods- penny 
only upon change of tenant by death, and nothing on the death of the lord. 

A little weft of this town, above the meeting of the two becks, there is a 
great cave or grotto in Caldbeck (near to the earl of Egremont's mill) called 
the Hawk y which was a receptacle in former times for thieves, where many 
people may have fhelter together. 

The earl of Egremont hath no demefne lands here, but feveral free rents, 
and about 120 cuftomary tenants who pay 49/ 16 s %d yearly rent, a ten penny 
fine certain, with heriots, fuit of court, and the thirteenth moulter. 

Half a mile higher fouthward within this parifh ftands He/let, being a mefne 
manor within the earl of Egremont's, and a market town, hav.ng a market on 
Friday weekly ; whereof Sir Gilfrid Lawfon of Brayton baronet is lord, who 
fucceeded his brother Sir Wilfrid, fon of Sir Alfrid, brother of S.r Gilfrid, 
fon of Wilfrid, who was fecond fon of Sir Wilfrid Lawfon of Ifel baronet, 
which laft named Sir Wilfrid had it as heir to his mother Elizabeth, who was 
daughter and fole heir of William Beauly efquire, it having continued in the 
male line of the Beaulies for feveral hundred years before. 

MoJJdale ftands a mile higher upon Caldew, under Carrock mountain; which, 
with Swinejide lying oppofite thereto, makes another mefne manor, held of the 
faid earl of Egremont by Edward Hafiel of Dalemain efquiie, who purchafed 
the fame of Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet, who purchafed of 
the ladies Barbara and Anne daughters and coheirs of Thomas earl of Suficx. 
For George Fiennes lord Dacre dying without ifiue in 1549, his only fifter and 
heir Margaret was married to Sampfon Lennard efquire, whofe defcendents in 
right of the faid Margaret were lords Dacre, and intitled to this little manor, 
and were in 1674 advanced to the further dignity of earls of Suflex. This in 
former times was a place where the Dacres barons of Grayftock kept their red 
deer and wild fwine, but being afterwards divided into tenancies, there are 
now fix tenements in Moffdale and two in SwinefiJe, each of which pays 14J 
yearly free rent to the faid Mr. Hafiel. 

This rectory is valued in the king's books at 45/ 13 s 6^d. And is now 
worth about 1 So I per annum. 

The firft retfor that we meet with was the aforefaid John Franceys, who was 
a kinfman of Gilbert Franceys lord of Rowcliff-, which John Franceys inclofed 
the lands called Parfon's park in the reign of king John.

In the year 13 12, Robert de Halghton was rector of Caldbeck, and removed 
toOuiby on an exchange with Adam de Appelby. And in 1332, a commiflion 
was iffued to inquire what dilapidations were in the chancel or manfe at Cald- 
beck, and to fequefter the goods and chattels of Adam de Appelby the late 
rector deceaied towards the repairs thereof. 

Robert de Bramley, profeflbr of civil law, fucceeded Adam de Appelby, and 
in 1334 made an exchange with Peter de Galiciano rector of Horncaftle, which 
was confirmed by the bifhops of Carlifle and Lincoln refpedtively. And in 
the next year after, Peter resigning, Nicholas de Whitrigg was collated ; with 
leave to be abfent from his cure in purfuit of his ftudies for three years. By 
his laft will he bequeathed his body to be buried in the chancel of the church 
of Caldbeck, and to Henry de Malton and Thomas de Whitrigg knights 
140 oxen. 

In 1362, on the death of Nicholas de Whitrigg, Mr. William de Ragenhill

There is a poor Jlock of 30/, left by Cuthbert Brown in 1665; which is let 
out to intereft by the overfeers, and the produce divided among poor note- 
holders. 

Arthur Savage the redlor, by his will bearing date Nov. 1, 1698, gave 
to this parifh 50/; the intereft thereof to be applied for the binding out poor 
children apprentices. 

There is alfo a fchool Jlock of 103/, which was raifed by voluntary contri- 
butions in the year 1647, which is lodged in the hands of fome of the mod 
fubftantial inhabitants, and they pay the intereft thereof to a fchoolmafter. By 
one of the articles then made and agreed upon, every perfon who then con- 
tributed to the ftock fhould be free to the fchool, and likewife his lineal de- 
pendents enjoying the eftate of the firft contributor; but in cafe any of their 
cftates fhould be fold, it was agreed, for the encouragement of the fchool, 
that the feller ftiould lofe this freedom to the fchool, and the buyer fhould not 
acquire any, but be as a foreigner. 

PARISH OF WESTWARD. 

The parifh of Westward lies north from Caldbeck, and is made up of a 
number of houfes lying fcattered up and down, every one of which hath a 
ready forth-gate to the common. 

It is bounded by Shalkbeck from the foot thereof to the head, and fo at 
cends over the weft end of Brocklebank fell as far as Thornthwaite ; fo down 
the water by Thackthwaite, Iflekirk, P?rfon's bridge, and Shaking bridge, 
till it fall into Waver, and down Waver till it come to Rook's of the bridge, 
then bending eaftward to a place called Meflengers of the Mofs, and from 
thence on the north fide of Granger houfes and Brigbank to Wyfa beck, then 
erofs Tiffinthwaite to Forfter folds, and then down by the foot of Manybanks 
on the fouth fide of Moorthwaite to Millbeck, until it falls into Wampool river, 
and then up that river till Shalk falls into it. 

This place at the time of the conqueft was foreft ground of Allerdale; 
and was granted by Alan fecond lord of Allerdale to king Henry the fecond; 
who annexed it to, and incorporated it with his foreft of linglewood, and from 
thence it received the name of the Weft Ward *.

Afterwards, king John having granted the hermitage of St. Hilda within 
the boundaries of this Westward to the monafteiy of Holm Cultram, the 
monks erected not far from thence a chapel or oratory, which in procefs of 
time obtained parochial rites, but was then (as, properly fpeaking, all forefts 
art) extraparochial. 

And in the 18 Ed. 1. there was a memorable caufe concerning the tithes of 
Linthwait and Curthwaii both within the above mentioned bounds of this 
p.u-ifh. Firft, the king claimed them as of common right, he being intitled 
to the tithes of all places extraparochial. Next, the bifhop claimed them as 
within the parim of Afpatrick. Then the prior and convent of Carlifle claimed 
them by grant from king Henry the fecond as of an affart within the foreft of 
Englewood. Finally, the parfon of Thurfby claimed them as within his pa- 
rim. And it was found for the king. 

And the faid king, in the 22d year of his reign, by his charter fetting forth 
his recovery of the tithes aforefaid, grants unto the faid prior and convent 
and their fuccefTors not only the tithes of the places above mentioned, but alfo 
all tithes accruing in all lands and places in the foreft of Englewood that fhall 
be hereafter affarted, not being within the limits of any parim, without the im- 
pediment or interruption of the king or his heirs, his juftices, forefters, ver- 
derers, or other officers of the foreft -f-. 

And fince that time the church of Carlifle hath enjoyed thefe tithes of this 
Weft ward, ftyling it parcel of the parifli of St. Mary's Carlifle. The prefent 
lefTee is Sir Philip Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet, and the grant is in the fol- 
lowing words: All the tithe corn, grain, and (heaves, and the tithe hay, hemp, 
and line, within certain limits and bounds of the foreft of Weftward, parcel 
of the parim of St. Mary's Carlifle; that is, of Rofley, Reathwait, Brockle- 
bank, Haflellfpring, Cleathow, and alfo within the limits and bounds between 
Cleathow aforefaid and the bounds called St. Ellen the Old, being parcel there- 
of, and within Raven/head and Bladderflack, and within all other the limits 
and bounds and places titheable within the faid foreft of Weftward. Rent to 
the dean and chapter 6/j and to the curate 16/ free of all taxes.

This foreft having been granted, as is aforefaid, to king Henry the fecond, 
it continued in the crown till the reign of king Edward the third, who in the 
17th year of his reign, granted the fame to Thomas Lucie on his marriage 
with Agnes de Beaumont a kinfwoman of the faid king J, whofe daughter and 
laft furviving heir Maud conveyed it to her hufband Henry Percy the firft earl 
of Northumberland, in which family it continued till Henry the fixth earl of 
Northumberland gave it to king Henry the eighth. Queen Mary reftored the 
fame to Thomas earl of Northumberland brother to the laft Henry. Which 
Thomas being attainted in the reign of queen Elizabeth on account of the 
northern rebellion forfeited the fame during his life; after which forfeiture, in 
the 14EI1Z. a commiflion iffued to Richard bifhop of Carlifle, Henry lord 
Scrope, Thomas lord Wharton, Simon Mufgrave knight, Henry Curwen 
knight, Francis Slingfby, Cuthbert Mufgrave, John Penruddock, Anthony

the late attainted earl of Northumberland by the late queen Mary) to have 
common and pafture within the foreft of the Weftward. 

*' The fecond article : What inclofures the faid late earl of Northumber- 
M land hath made within the faid Weftward ; what quantity of ground or 
" number of acres the fame inclofure doth contain ; and how the fame hath 
** been ufed â€¢, and what yearly rent hath been paid and anfwered fince the 
" fame inclofure ?" â€” Anfwer : Since the reftitution of the faid late attainted 
earl, there have been made and improved fix fcore and feven inclofures, con- 
taining twenty-feven fcore, five acres, half acre, one rood, one half rood j 
of which fixfeore and feven inclofures there be newly inhabited and houfes

feven inclofures, which be fourfcore and fifteen in number, and contain feven-

farmholds befides : And they find, that the rents inhanfed or referved upon 
the faid inclofures (as they learn and underftand by a copy of a rental fhevved 
by the late receiver of the faid late attainted earl of Northumberland, other 
than which copy of rental they can have no certain intelligence) do amount to 
the fum of gl igs $d. 

*' The third article : How many of the inclofures may remain in what 
*' ftate they be, without annoyance and hurt to the tenants and inhabitants 
" that claim common and pafture there within the fame?" â€” To this they 
find and prefent, that none of the faid improvements and inclofures may 
remain in the fame ftate they be, without annoyance to the faid tenants and 
inhabitants fpecified in the firft article, and that claim common and pafture 
within the fame. 

To the feveral following articles they give one general anfwer, as follows ;

The firft divifion within this parifh is Brocklebank, towards Caklbeck, 
lying on the north eaft fide of Brocklebank fell, which is divided from Reeth- 
wait or Rcedthwaite by a little rill called Silverbeck, which meeting with 
"Wifa beck at the northweft end of Weftward park, makes one ftream till it 
falls into Wampool below Wigton. This is the mod hilly and the fulleft of 
wood of any part of the parifh, and hath plenty of coal about Shawk head, 
Lowpgill, and Weftward park, which are moftly a cannel coal. This divi- 
fion doth alfo comprehend Haflethorp, Tonguethwait, and Clea. At which 
laft place, William Mufgrave a younger fon of Sir William Mufgrave of 
Crookdake was feated, and whofe daughter Anne carried the inheritance 
to the Fletchers of Deerham, in whofe name and family it ftill continues. 

Rosley divifion lies northeaft of the former, being divided from it by 
Wyfa beck, which arifes at one end of the town of Rofley, at the other end 
whereof is held yearly a great fair on Whitfun Monday, and alfo every 
fortnight day after till All Saints day, for horfe c , cattle, fheep, cloth, and 
many other kinds of goods. Breconthwaite, Height, and Woodcock hill are 
parcel of this quarter of the parifh. 

Woods ide is another divifion, which lies towards Wampool. The firft 
hamlet is Howrigg and Eaft Kirkthwait by Shawkfoot and Weft Kirkthwait. 
Sir Gilfrid Lawfon and Mr. Brifco of Crofton have here an undivided lord- 
fhip, the tenants whereof pay yearly rents and arbitrary fines. 

Stoneraise divifion lies more weft upon Wyfa, beginning at Highmoor 
and Fofter's fold, then to Kirkhill and Ilekirk, then to Crofshill, fo round 
Harthwait common, by Silly Wrey, Grainger houfes, and Brigbank. to Red 
Dial, where the ruins of Old Carlifle appear. 

Ilekirk (Hildkirk) had its name from the hermitage of St. Hilda above- 
mentioned, which king John gave to the abbey of Holm Cultram, whofe 

grant 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Ilekirk.) i 43 

grant bears date the firft of March in the fixteenth year of his reign ; whereby 
he grants to the abbey of Holme and the monks there ferving God, the 
hermitage of St. Hilda in his foreft of Inglewood, with the land which 
Roger the hermit had held there ; with liberty of a vaccary for 40 cows in 
the faid foreft, and their young till the age of two years ; and pafture for 
as many horfes and oxen as will till the faid land ; and that they fhall be free 
from eicape, and from puture of the forefters -j-. Which grant was con- 
firmed by king Henry the third J. 

After the diflohuion of the monafteries, king Henry the eighth by letters 
patent bearing date July 15, in the 35th year of his reign, granted to Thomas 
J)alfton efquire (amongft many other particulars) all thofe mefiuages, lands, 
tenements, meadows, paftures, rents, reverlions, fervices, and hereditaments 
whatfoever, in Hildkirke in the county of Cumberland, viz. the mefiuages 
and tenements in the feveral tenures of Richard Barwife, John Brown^ Adam 
Afkew, Richard Milner, and John Plumber, and all that park called Hild- 
kirk park, late belonging to the monaftery of Holme; rendering for the fame 
yearly at the feaft of St. Michael the archangel 15s %\d. 

And in the next year, viz. May 20, 36 Hen. b\ there is a licence to 
Thomas Dalfton efquire to convey the capital meffuage of Hildkirke called 
Hildkirk grange, with four mefiuages and tenements in the tenure of John 
Barwys gentleman, John Plumber, and RichardMilner, to Anthony Barwys 
gentleman, for the fine of 43 s $d paid into the exchequer. 

After three or four generations, the fame defcended to Richard Barwrfe 
efquire (called the Great Barwife from his gigantic ftature) who died in the 
year 7.648 without iffue, as dppears from the following monumental infeription

Old Carlisle aforefaid ftands upon the river Wifa, where (as Mr. Camden 
obferves) the melancholy ruins of an ancient city teach us, that nothing in 
this world is out of the reach of fate. But what the ancient name was, he 
did not know, unlefs it was the Caflra Exploratorumf. But Mr. HorQey 
takes it to be Olenacum. He fays, " The ruins here are very grand and con- 
" fpicuous. It ftands upon a military way, very large and vifible, leading 
*' directly to CarliQe and the Roman wall. And there is no other ftation 
" upon this way, between it and CarliQe or the wall. Old Carlifle is about a 
" mile fouth from Wigton, about eight miles fouthweft from Carlifle, and 
" about twelve or fourteen weft from Old Penrith and ten or more eaft from 
'* Elenborough. The ramparts of the ftation lie two of them directly eaft 
" and weft, and the other north and fouth. There feems to have been a 
" double agger quite round it. The river Wiza runs on the fouth and weft 
" fides of the ftation, about half a mile from it, and the defcent to the 
c< river is fteep ; yet the outbuildings have been on all fides here as well as at 
" Old Penrith. From this ftation there is a very large profpedt, efpecially 
â– " weftward, reaching to the fea. The Wiza, on which Old Carlifle ftands, 
" may be imagined to have fome affinity with Virofidum, as well as the Elne 
" with Olenacum, if the order of the Notitia did not difagree. According to 
" the Notitia, Olenacum was garrifoned by a body of horfe, called Ala 
" Herculea, and it appears from infcriptions that the Ala Augufta (afterwards 
" from the emperor Maximianus Herculius called Ala Herculea) was long at 
" Old Carlifle. It was there, when Fufiranus and Silanus were confuls in

The church of Weftward was returned to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty at 23/, and is now worth about 30/ per annum. 

In the church yard is the following epitaph : " Under this ftone lies the 
" body of major Philip Fletcher of Clea ; who ferved their majeftys king 
*' William and queen Mary feveral years, and alfo queen Anne. He was in 
" all the confiderable actions and fieges of her reign under the great and

whereof to be given to the poor of Weftward, and the other fourth to the 
poor of Wigton town ; as appears from an infcription on a plate of brafs in 
the church of Weftward. 

In 1747 it was certified, that there were 155 families in this parifh s of

PARISH OF BOLTON. 

Bolton (Bothtlton) is the next parifh to Weftward, and is bounded by 
Thornthwaite clofe beck from the head thereof to the foot where it falls into 
Waver below Rookfbridge, and fo up Waver to Little gill above Blathwait on 
the weft fide of Waver, and fo up that gill to the head thereof, and then 
directly north weft to Crumbock, then up Crumbock fouthwards to above 
Prieft croft, apd then in a direct line fouthweft to Meals Gate, and thence 
following down Dowbeck to Whitehall park wall, fo up by that wall to Cock- 
ermouth road, and then along that road to Cockbridge, from thence up Elne 
river to Ireby bridge end, then up Birkby beck by Awhatree to the head 
of that beck,,, thence turning eaft to Thorny ftone, and fo to the top of 
Sandale hill, then pointing north on the tops of the hills unto the head of 
Thornthwait. 

This is one intire manor as well as parifh, and was anciently demefne 
of Allerdale, until Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale gave the fame with Baf- 
fenthwait and the Ifle of Eaft Holm to his baftard fon Gofpatric, whole p< te- 
rity took their furname from BafTenthwair.

Bolton (who married Chriftian daughter of William de Ireby) confirmed to 
the abbot and monks of Holme Cultram the hermitage of St. Hilda, and 
granted them common in Bolton -f. 

His widow Chriftian de Ireby afterwards married Robert Bruce, and died in 
the 33 Ed. i. feifed of Hafelfpring in Weftward, Gamelfby and Unthank 
beyond Eden, and of Market Ireby, which Ireby (lie held of John Boyvil 
lord of Thurfby. 

In Edward the fecond's time, Roger Mowbray was lord of Bolton, and for- 
feited his eftate there by taking part with Robert Bruce. Afterwards it came 
to his fon Robert Mowbray in Edward the third's time â€¢, and to Alexander 
Mowbray-, and after to the Nevils. In the 12 Ric. 2. John Nevil of Raby 
died feifed of Bolton and of the Mowbrays lands in Gamelfby and Unthank. 
In the 2 2d of that king's reign Ralph Nevil held Bolton and Baffinthwait 
of Maud de Lucy. And thenceforth the Nevils lords Latimer held the fame, 
until it fell to Henry earl of Northumberland by the death of his mother one of 
the daughters and coheirs of the laft lord Latimer of that name of the Nevils. 
And it hath been ever fince a manor of the houfe of Northumberland, and the 
earl of Egremont now enjoys it as one of the Percy's heirs as is aforefaid. 

There are four divifions or conftablewicks within this parifh. 1. Bolton 
wood, which beginning at Thornthwaite clofe, runneth along the weft fide of 
that beck to Thackthwait, and fo down to Rookfbridge below Bolton wood 
foot. This part of it was heretofore moft of it woodland ; but the wood 
being much cleared away, the lands have been broken into tenancies and 
tillage, except part of Hildkirk demefne which lies on Bolton fide of the 
water. 2. Bolton row, which begins at Meal's Gate, and fo afcending up 
Newlands row by Weary Hall (heretofore the feat of the Porters) where is

Harbv brow adjoins to Whitehall demefne, from which it is only fevered 
by the park wall, and is a diftinct manor called Leefgill fince it came to 
the Highmores, as appears by an old infcription on a rtone in the kitching

PARISH OF ASPATRIA. 

Aspatria, or Afpatr'uk, was fo firft named from Gofpatric earl of Dunbar 
father of Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale. This parifh is bounded by Elne 
river from the foot of Elne bridge clofe to the ring dike that parts Allerby 
and Crofby fields, and fo along that ring hedge northwards to the divifion 
between Hayton and Canonby fields, then turning eaftward between Hayton 
and Alanby meadows, and fo as the divifion parts between Newton demefne 
and Afpatria's north Riving, fo diredlly eaftward along the common to 
the middle of Broadhead, and fo into Crumbock, and then up that beck to 
Pried croft, fo turning weftward by the ring hedge of Leefrigg to King gate, 
and then to Baggray lane end, and fo along the hedge which fevers Brayton 
demefne from Baggray field to Elnbrig clofe, and fo to the foot thereof. 

The firft townfhip in this parifh is Brayton. It was the habitation of 
Alan de Brayton ; for Alan fecond lord of Allerdale gave the fervices of 
Brayton to Ughtred after he had given him Ughtredby ; and his pofterity 
afterwards took the name de Brayton, until the male line failed. It is now the 
inheritance of Sir Gilfrid Lawfon baronet, whofe great grandfather Sir Wilfrid 
Lawfon of Ifell baronet did purchafe it of the three daughters and coheirs 
of Thomas Salkeld a younger brother of the houfe of Whitehall. The 
manor is of a fquare form, being bounded by Afpatria common on the north 
and eaft fides, by Baggrey fields on the fouth, and Afpatria field on the weft. 
The capital meffuage or manor houfe ftands exactly in the middle of it, and 
was much improved by the late Sir Wilfrid Lawfon, who alfo built a very 
fine park wall, and purchafed the tenants lands, and made them part of 
the demefne. 

Aspatria townfhip and manor lies next, being half a mile or more weft 
from Brayton â€¢, it is bounded by the common on the north, by the demefne of 
Brayton on the eaft, by Elne on the fouth, and by the demeines of Outerfide 
and Hayton on the weft. It ftands upon the ridge of an hill, pointing eaft 
and weft, in length above half a mile, upon a dry fand. This was demefne 
of Allerdale for a long time. On the divifion of the inheritance of William 
Fitz Duncan and Alice de Romley his wife among their three daughters and

154 ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Outerby.) 

Outerby, or Ughthredby, lies a mile north-weft from Afpatria, upon lower 
ground near Elne; and is bounded by the grounds of Afpatria on the north 
and eaft, by Elne on the fouth, and by Alwardby pafture on the weft. This 
is a little manor of Sir Gilfrid Lawfon's, whofe anceftor Sir Wilfrid Lawlbn 
of Ifell purchafed it from Charles Orfeur of High-clofe, in whole family it 
had been for many generations. There is a good colliery at this place. There 
are about ten freehold tenants, and twenty cuftomary, one half whereof under 
Brayton pay arbitrary fines, and the other half under one Mrs. Walker pay 
fine cercain. 

Alwardby lies a'mile north-weft from Outerby. It was at fiift fo named 
from Ayleward father of Dolphin who was firft planted here, and called the 
place after his own name. And this place afterwards did give name to a fa- 
mily of the Allerbys, whole daughter and heir was married to Porter a younger 
brother of the houfe of Weary-hall. Amongft the knights fees in Cumber- 
land in the 35 Hen. 8. it is fet forth, that William Porter then held the capital 
meffuage and town of Alwardby of the king in capite, rendring for the fame 
yearly 3 d cornage, and 8ifeawake, with other Cervices due and accuftomed. 
The laft of this name having no child made his wife joint tenant with him, 
and fhe furviving afterwards married a younger brother of the Eglesfields, in 
whofe family it continued for feveral generations, until Richard Eglesfield, lbn 
of Richard, fon of Thomas, fon of Richard, fold it about 90 years ago to 
Richard Lamplugh of Dovenby efquire, in whofe heir it ftill continues. Here

is bounded by Alwardby fields and Mealhay on the weft, by Alanby and New- 
ton fields on the north, and by Afpatria and Outerby common on the eaft 
and fouth. 

The word bay in the foreft language fignified a hunting ground inclofed, and 
this place feerns to have received its name upon the like account ; for Alan 
fecond lord of Allerdale granted this place to his huntfman Seliff and his fel- 
lows, whofe pofterity took the name de Hayton. 

The laft of the name John de Hayton had a daughter and heir married to 
Robert de Mulcafter, a younger fon of the Penningtons of Mulcafter-, which

de Mulcafter transferred to Piers- Jeffrey Tilliol ; in whofe male line it conti- 
nued for eight defcents, and then came to two fitters coheirs, viz. Ifabel, mar- 
ried to John Colvil who had Hayton for her purparty, and Margaret married to 
James More/by.

Robert. William Colvil the elder fucceeded his mother in her part of the Til- 
liol's lands, and died in the 20 Ed. 4. without iffue male, leaving two daugh- 
ters coheirs, whereby the Tilliols lands became further divided. Phyllis the

de Lucy transferred it to the earls of Northumberland, of whom Henry the 
fixth earl transferred it to king Hen. 8. Which faid king, Feb. 4, in the 37th

their veffels alfo fail yearly up the Baltic, for timber, flax, iron, and other 
merchandize. They have not much of the American trade ; only a few fhips 
yearly fail to North America. They have a furnace for carting iron ware, which 
carries on a confiderable trade. They have alfo a glafshoufe, but at prelent not 
much ufe is made of it. 

In the year 1760, a chapel was erected at Mary-port, and confecrated by 
bifhop Lyttelton in 1763 by the name of St. Mary's chapel. The late Hum- 
phrey Senhoufe efquire gave 200/, whereby to procure a benefaction from the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty, from which, and from certain fums 
charged upon the pews, the curate's falary amounts to about 35I per annum. 
The nomination was referved in the aft of confecration to the faid Humphrey 
Senhoufe efquire and his heirs. 

PARISH OF BROMFIELD. 

Bromfield, or Brutfs-field, is the next parifh to Canonby, north-eaft from 
thence, and is of great extent, reaching from weft to eaft feven miles or more. 
It is bounded by the fea on the weft, by the boundary of Holm Cultram on 
the north, by the boundary of Wigton barony on the eaft, and by the meet- 
ing of Crumbock and Waver, and up Waver to Warthole miln, and then 
turning weftward to Crumbock, and then up Crumbock to Aketon head above 
Crookdake miln, thence along Crookdake moor crofs Broadhead to the ftone 
quarry in Newton gill, and then along the fouth fide of Newton demefne and 
fields to the north fide of Hayton fields, and fo to the fea. 

Alanby is the firft townfhip, Handing upon the fea fhore, and therewith 
is warned every fpring tide. It ftands level and flat, as doth the whole parifh, 
there being no femblance of an hill throughout the fame, except a little rifing 
ground about Crookdake and Blencogo, which ftand oppofite like two butts. 
This place was firft fo named from Alan the fecond lord of Allerdale, who 
being a melancholic man was pleafed with the lonely fituation of the place, 
and the rather in regard it was near to the abbey of Holme, which he had 
undertaken to rebuild. He gave it to fome of his kindred who took name 
therefrom and were called de Alanby, until the male line failed, and one of 
the daughters and coheirs was married to William Flemby, from whom it 
came by a daughter to Blenerhaffet, in whofe family the manor continued till 
between 60 and 70 years ago, when it was fold to the Thomlinfons with whom 
it ftill remaineth. The tenants are about 40 in number, all freehold, paying a 
fmall quit rent to the lord. 

In 1743, the reverend Dr. Thomlinfon propofed to affift the inhabitants of 

this village to build a chapel on a piece of wafte ground affigned by him for 

that purpofe as lord of the manor, but was fo ftrongly oppofed by the quakers 

1 that 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Alanby.) iS 3 

that it did not fucceed. But the next year he, at his own coft, built a chapel 
and furnilhed it with books and ornaments, on a piece of ground at the end 
of the town which he purchafed for that ufe. It is in length i 8 yards, and in 
breadth feven yards and one foot; containing 31 pews, beiides a large one for 
the lord of the manor, another for the curate, and another for the clerk. It 
was conlecrated by bilhop Fleming in 1745, dedicated (at D.. Thomlinfon's 
requeft) to Chrift, and the faid Dr. Thomlinfon his heirs and aligns decreed 
patrons. Over the door is this infcription, " This chapel was built by the 
" reverend Dr. Thomlinfon rector of Wickham and prebendary of St. Paul's 
" London, 1744." The faid bifhop Fleming foon after the confecration cer- 
tified the chapel to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at y I per annum, viz. 
5/ from the feats; and the houfe, liable, garden, and chapel yard, 2/. In 
confcquence whereof, it was augmented with 200/, in conjunction with the 
like fum given by the faid Dr. Thomlinfon. 

There is likewife a neat fchoolhoufe built adjoining to the chapel by contri- 
butions in part, but chiefly by the curate who is obliged to teach fchool there. 

In the year 1755, 100/ was laid out in the name of Dr. Waugh chancellor 
of the diocefe in lands in Blencogo for the ufe of this fchool. â™¦ 

In Alanby there was a melTuage and tenement belonging to the abbey of 
Holm Cultram, which at the time of the difiblution was in the tenure of Mi- 
chael Fawcon, and in the 37 Hen. 8. July 9, was granted to Thomas Dalfton 
efquire. 

West Newton is the next townfhip in this parifh, two miles eaft from 
Alanbv, and a mile north from Hayton ; and is now the manor of the furviv- 
ing coheir of the Mufgraves of Hayton. It was at firft one intire manor 
(whereof Alanby was parcel) and was granted by Alan the fecond lord of Al- 
lerdale to Odard de Wigton, who gave it to Ketel his fourth fon, father of 
Adam de Newton who firft took that name. Which Adam was fucceeded by 
his brother Richard, who gave lands at Newton to the abbey of Holme Cul- 
tram â€¢, whofe grant was confirmed by Adam de Newton his fon. Which Adam 
had a fon Richard, who alfo confirmed his grandfather's grant. The faid Ri- ' 
chard had a fon Thomas, who had another fon Thomas, who had a daughter 
and heir married to Roger Martindale ; in whofe family it continued for three 
or four generations, until that family ended in daughters. 

Thus amongft the knights fees in Cumberland in the 35 Hen. 8. it appears, 
that Cuthbert KatclifTe, John Blenerhafiet, Anthony Barker, Richard Dacre, 
and Humphrey Dacre, in the right of their wives, daughters and heirs of James 
Martindale coparceners, held jointly and undivided the manor of Newton upon 
the fea, with the appurtenances, and the vill of Newton, of the king in capite 
by knights fervice, cornage 13^4^, feawake, and fuit of court. They alfo 
held the manor of Ormefby ; fo alfo lands and tenements in Langrigg, Brom- 
field, Meildrigg, Crookdake, Keldfike, and Lounthwaite by like fervices. 

After the partition of the eftate, Newton came to the Mufgraves, by mar- 
riage (as it mould ieem) of one of the coheirs of Martindale after the death 

Y 2 of 



X6+ ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Newton.) 

of her firft hufband. For Mr. Denton, who was cotemporary, fays, " Newtorr 
*' in Allerdale is now the inheritance of Edward Mufgrave iecond fon toWil- 
" liam and his wife one of the coheirs of Martindale laft of that name lord 
" of Newton." And in that family of Mufgrave it hath continued ever 
fince. 

The arms of Newton were ; Argent, a cheveron Azure, charged with three 
garbes Or. 

The arms of Martindale j Barry of fix, Argent and Gules, a bend Azure. 

The town of Newton is pretty long, and hath a rill running through the 
middle of it from eaft to weft. The capital meffuage flood at the weft end of 
the town, but being uninhabited fince that eftate came to the family of Hay- 
ton, there is nothing left of it but the fhell of an old tower and a dove 
coat. 

The demefne lies above the town fouth-weft towards Afpatria and Hayton, 
which is very large and fertil. But there is little or no wood about all the 
townfhip, and few inclofures. 

At the eaft end of the town is an excellent quarry of free ftone, for flagsÂ» 
troughs, pofts, chimney pieces, and fuch like. 

Langrigg is the next townfhip, being a long ridge of land, pointing eaft- 
ward towards Bromfield. This was demefne of Allerdale, and was granted 
by Waldieve lord thereof to Dolphin fon of Aylward, with Applethwaite and 
Brigham, The family of Dolphin became extinct in Henry the third's time. 
After which, we find it in the name de Langrigg. In the 9 Ed. 1. Agnes 
wife of Gilbert de Langrigg demanded againft John Crookdake 25 acres of 
land, 15 acres of meadow, and is 5^ rent there \ and againft Thomas de 
Langrigg 30 acres of land, and 14 acres of meadow. 

In the regifter of the abbey of Holme Cultram we find Agnes wife of Ralph 
de Ofmunderley and Alice wife of Thomas de Laithes daughters and heirs of 
Thomas de Langrigg. 

In the 39 Ed. 3. John de Bromfield and Thomas de Lowther held lands in 
Langrigg, rendring for the fame 6s 8 d cornage, and yd feawake, being of 
the yearly value of 5/. 

Afterwards, we find Langrigg in the Porters and Ofmunderleys. The 
Porters held the manor and old rent, and the Ofmunderleys had the demefne 
and fix tenements there, as appears by an inquifition pqft mortem of Cuthbert 
Ofmunderley 4 Oct. 41 Eliz. who alfo died feifed of fix tenements in Whay- 
rigg, one in Moor raw, one in Blencogoe, two in Bowaldeth, one in Arma- 
mathwait, fix in Oughterfide, four in Meldrigg, feven in Waverton, and four 
in Louthwaite. 

This family of Ofmunderley (Ofmotherly, Ofmunderlaw) came from a 
place of that name in Lancashire, and was of great repute in the county of 
Cumberland. In the 21 Ric. 2. William Ofmunderlaw reprefented the county 
of Cumberland in parliament. In the 4 Hen. 4. and 6 Hen, 5. he was fheriff 

of 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Langrigg.) 165 

of the county. The laft of the family, the reverend Salkeld Ofmotherly, fold 
Langrigg (for they had alfo purchafed Porter's part) to Thomas Barwife father 
of the prefent owner, in the year 1735. â€” The arms of Olmunderley are*, 
Argent, a fefs ingrailed, between 3 martlets Sable. 

The Berwifes alfo are a very ancient and refpecfable family in this county. 
Richard Barwife efquire was fheriff of the county feveral times in the reign of 
Cha. 1. his feat being then at Waverton. They were anciently polTefTed of 
Ireby, Ilekirk, Blencogoe, and Deerham. â€” Their arms are-, Argent, a cheve- 
ron between three boars heads couped and muzzled Sable. 

The abbey of Holme Culcram had divers poffeflions in Langrigg, which 
after the diffolution were granted (amongfl: others) to Thomas Dallton ; viz, a 
mefTuage and tenement and 12 acres of arable land and a free rent of 3^ 4 d in 
the tenure of Paul Dovingby, a dove coat with the appurtenances in the tenure 
of John S^urre, and a yearly rent of ^d and other fervices ifTuing of the lands 
late of Thomas Thurnebrand, and a parcel of land with the appurtenances in 
the tenure of William Wright. 

Greenhow adjoins to Langrigg, and is part of that townmip, where Mr. 
Brifco hath a good demeine and lome tenants. He is of a younger branch of 
the Brifcoes of Crofton, whofe anceftor married the heirefs of the Greenhows 
of Greenhow. 

Crookdake is alfo included in this townfhip. It was for a long time the 
feat of a younger branch of the Mufgraves of Mufgrave and Edenhall. Amongft 
the knights fees in the 35 Hen. 8. it is found, that Cuthbert Mufgrave fon of 
Mungo held the. manor and hamlet of Crookdake with the appurtenances of 
the king by knights fervice, and rendring for the fame yearly is cornage by 
the hands of the (herifT of Cumberland. He held alfo at the fame time lands 
in many other places. 

This family, like molt others, ended in daughters â€¢, and Crookdake came 
with Anne eldeft daughter of William Mufgrave to Sir John Balantine who was 
born at Carros in Clydefdale and bred a phyfician, in which name and family, 
it continued for three or four generations, and then this family alfo ended in a 
daughter and heir, the prefent owner, married to Lawfon Dykes efquire. a 
younger fon of the family of Dykes of Warthole, who in the year 1773 had. 
a licence from the crown to affume the furname and bear the arms of Bal- 
lantine. 

Bromfield and Scales make the next townfhip, and are fituate about 
the middle of the parifh. This was granted by Waldieve firft lord of Al- 
lerdale to Melbeth his phyfician, whofe pofterity took the name de Bromfield, . 
But the patronage of the church he referved out of that grant, and gave the 
fame to the abbey of St. Mary's York. The faid abbey had alfo lands at Brom- 
field, as likewife had the abbey of Holm Cultram â€¢, and by the general term 
manor being applied to them both, it is difficult to afcertain their feparate:

Soon after the foundation of the abbey of Holme Cultram, Adam fon of 
'Thomas de Brunfeld granted to the fame abbey the manor of Brunfield, by the 
boundaries in the grant fpecified *. 

After this grant, Thomas de Brunfeld (the faid Adam's father) grants to the 
monks of Holme the cultivated lands in Brunfield called Northrig, with the 
marfli on the eaft part thereof -f-. 

And Henry fon of the faid Thomas confirmed his father's grant, and further 
granted to the faid monks two acres of land lying within one of their inclofures, 
for one mark of filver which they gave unto him for the fame. 

And Walter fon of Benedict the prieft quit-claimed to the monks all his 
right and claim of common of pafture in the marfh which Adam and Thomas 
de Brunfeld gave to the faid monks. 

Agnes daughter of Adam White of Brunfeld, carpenter, gave to the faid 
monks five acres of arable land and one acre of meadow in the territory of 
Brunfeld ; which grant Thomas fon of Thomas de Brunfeld confirmed. And. 
Alan fon of Henry de Brunfeld quitted claim of all his right therein.

In the 20 Ed. 1. Hugh Ton of Alan de Brunfield having a controverfy with 
the faid monks concerning common of pafture upon the aforefaid marfh, an 
agreement was made and a limitation prefcribed within what places and at 
what times each of them reflectively might departure their cattle without 
the interruption of the other-f. And there was a like agreement in the fame 
year, between the faid monks and Ralph de Ofmunderlawe and Agnes his 
wife, and Thomas de Laithes and Alice his wife, concerning the faid marfh. 

After the diffolution of the monasteries, we find amongit the knights fees 
in Cumberland in the 35 Ken. 8. that William Hutton held the manor of 
Bromfield of the king in capite as of his manor of Papcaftle, rendring for the 
fame 18 s 4-d corn age, 10 d feawake, 6d free rent, puture of the ierjeants, 
and witnefman. Â» 

In the fame year, July 15, the faid king grants to Thomas Dalfton efquire 
(amongft other particulars) one tenement in Bromfield with the appurtenances 
in the tenure of John Scurre, and one other tenement with the appurtenances 
in the tenure of William Scurre, late parcel of the pofTeffions of the monaftery 
of Holme in the county of Cumberland â€¢, paying for the fame to the king 
yearly at the feaft of St. Michael the archangel %s l\d.

The above poffefTions afterwards became feparated into many hands. The 
Porters of Weary-hall feem firft to have had the largeft fhare. Sir John Bal- 
lantine purchafed the demefne at Scales of Mr. Jofeph Porter; which Mr. 
Porter fold alfo the tenements of moft of the tenants to freehold ; the re- 
mainder, with the demefne lands at Langrigg hall, he fold to Ofmotherly â€¢, 
.and Ofmotherly infranchifed the reft of the tenants and fold the demefne 
to Mr. Barwife, in whofe family it ftill continues. The demefne and tithes of 
Bromfield are now held by Sir Gilfrid Lawfon baronet; the demefne of Scales, 
and the tithes of Crookdake and Langrigg, by the heirefs of Ballantine : 
Weft Newton by the inhabitants, who purchafed the fame of Thomas Simp-

cock of Penrith in right of his wife, another of the fifters and coheirs of the 
faid Mr. Pattinfon. 

The church of Bromfield is dedicated to St. Kentigern or Mungo ; and 
is valued in the king's books at 22/. The prefent yearly value is about 
100/. 

It was granted by Waldieve fon of Gofpatric as aforefaid to the abbey of 
St. Mary's York. And they had the patronage and advowfon until the year 
1302, when the abbot and convent, complaining of great loffes they had 
lateiy fuftained, and particularly of 300 marks yearly rent and 10,000 marks 
of mefne profits and cofts recovered againft them by the earl of Lincoln, pre- 
vail with the bifhop of Carlifle to appropriate the rectory of Bromfield to their 
monaftery ; which he grants on condition of their fecuring 40 marks of 
yearly revenue to a vicar there, referving at the fame time to his fee the col- 
lation of the vicar, in recompence of the injury by fuch appropriation accru- 
ing to the rights of his church of Carlifle. From which time the bifhops 

have 



ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Bromfield.) 169 

have conftantly collated to the vicarage. And in the next year, the abbot and 
convent gave a proxy to Adam de Twcnge one of their monks and Simon de 
Leyceftre clerk, to tranfact on their part with the bifhop of Carlifle, and to 
take poffeffion of the profits of the church of Brumfield for their ufe. 
And the fame year the bifhop collated Ralph de /Me to the vicarage of 
Bromfield. 

In 1330, on the refignation of William de Suthwerk vicar of Bromfield, 
bifhop Rofs collates William de Otrington. This refignation being made in 
favour of the bifhop's chaplain, Suthwerk had a penfion of ten marks out of 
the faid vicarage. 

In 1339, on a fuggeftion that the churches of Bromfield and Kirkby 
Stephen, after their being appropriated to St. Mary's York, were exempt 
from their former fubjection to the bifhops of Carlifle ; the bifhop protefts 
(by an instrument figned in the prefence of a notary apoftolic) that it never 
was the intention of himfelf or his predeceflbrs in any act of theirs, to coun- 
tenance any fuch pretenfion. 

In 1344, Roger de Kirk Ofwald rector of Morefby in Lincolnfhire, born in 
the diocefe of Carlifle, and hoping to enjoy his health and friends better than 
he doth in Lincolnfhire, defiies a change with Hugh de Whitelawe vicar of 
Bromfeld ; who is alfo defirous of the change, becaufe he is inclinable to ftudy 
the laws in the univerfity, and cannot fo readily obtain leave of abfence from 
a vicarage as a rectory. The reafons are approved by their refpective dio- 
cefans â€¢, and the bifhop of Carlifle, patron of both livings, collates the one 
and prefents the other accordingly. This Hugh de Whitelawe had been

repair the fame ; the faid abbot and convent appear by their proctors Thomas 
Pygot prior of their cell at Wetherhall and Alan de Newark advocate in the 
court of York, and fay, that John de Culwen the vicar ought to repair the

During the ufurpation of Oliver Cromwell, William Grainger vicar of Brom-

An anthem to the king of kings. 1673.

In Brom field, before the diflblution of the religious houfes, was a chantry 
pretty largely endowed, as appears from the grant thereof by king Edward 
the fixth, who by letters patent bearing date Jan. 30, in the 3d year of his 
reign, granted to Thomas Dalflon efquire and William Denton gentleman 
(amongft other particulars) the chantry of St, George the martyr lying in 
Bromfield in the county of Cumberland, and the yearly rent of us and 
fervices ifluing out of lands and tenements in Bromfield late the inheritance of 
Richard Coldall, and the yearly rent of 2s and fervices ifluing out of lands 
and tenements in Bromfield late John Wilkinfon's, and the rent of 14*/ and 
fervices ifluing out of lands and tenements late John Harrifon's in Bromfield 
aforefaid, alfo the rent of jd and fervices iffuing out of the lands and tene- 
ments late of John Lyon in Bromfield aforefaid, and the rent of 2 s and 
fervices ifluing of the lands and tenements late of William Coldall in Brom- 
field aforeiaid; and alfo four mefluages and tenements in the tenure of Thomas 
Lowes, Thomas Plafkett, and Richard Plafkett lying in Dundraw, to the 
faid chantry belonging ; alfo one mefluage and tenement with the appurte- 
nances in Crokedake in the tenure of William Bewley, one mefluage and 
tenement in Langrigg in the tenure of Robert Martindale, and all thofe lands, 
tenements and hereditaments in the tenure of David Matthewman, Ifabel 
Sym, and Miles Chamber in Meldrigg ; one mefluage and tenement in Gre- 
nefdale in the tenure of Thomas Walby, and the hereditaments called Garths 
in Dowbeck, all in the county of Cumberland, to the faid chantry in Brom- 
field belonging. 

The school at Bromfield was founded and endowed by Richard Ofmotherly 
of London, merchant taylor, in 161 2 ; who was a native of this parifh. He 
left 10/ per annum to be paid to the fchoolmaller by the merchant taylors 
company. There was alfo a long time ago 80/ raifed in the parifh for the 
fame ufe, but by fome means or other 16/ of it is loft, fo that the yearly 
intereft thereof is only 3/4J. The parifhioners add 12 s to it by way of 
afleflment. The fchoolmafler is generally the parifh clerk, which place is 
worth about 3/ a year. So that the whole united falary is about 16/ 16s. 

Blencogoe and Dundraw are in this parifh ; but being in Cumberland 
Ward, we refer them to be treated of there. 

In 1747, it was certified that there were in the parifh about 307 families ; 
17 of which were quakers, 4 prefbyterians, and one anabaptifl. 

PARISH OF HOLM CULTRAM. 

The next and laft parifh within this ward is the Holm, which was demefne 
of Allerdale; but king Stephen having given Cumberland and the earldom 
of Huntington to prince Henry eldeft fon and heir apparent of David king of 
Sects (for which Henry did homage, his father refufing them upon thofe

terms, becaufe he had fworn to acknowledge no other fovereign of England 
but the emprefs Matilda) the faid Henry in the year 1150 gave two parts 
in three of the Holme to the abbey, and the remaining third to Alan fon of 
Waldieve for his hunting there, but Alan inftantly gave the faid third part to 
the abbey, as that which the faid Henry had given him at the foundation 
of the abbey â€¢, and Waldieve fon of the faid Alan confented to the grant 
which his father had made : Which grant the faid Henry confirmed f. And 
David king of Scots father of the laid Henry .]-, and Malcolm king of Scots 
fon of the faid Henry, confirmed the grant which the faid Henry had 
made J. 

At the death of king Stephen, Henry fon of the emprefs Matilda, being the 
fecond of that name king of England, entered to Cumberland, which Stephen 
had before given to prince Henry of Scotland, and therefore the monks 
acknowledged him their founder-, and he granted them by his charter the 
whole ifland of Holme and Raby by their right bounds, with timber and 
pafture in the foreft of lnglevvood* ; which grant his fons and fucceflbrs 
Richard* and John confirmed. The boundaries by Richard's charter are 
thus afcertained : By a little fyke that falls into Wampole at Kirkbride, af- 
cending that fyke unto Cokelayk as the mofs and hard ground meet, thence 
through the middle of the mofs between Waytheholm and Laurence holm, 
and fo crois the mofs and wood to Anterpot, thence down Waver to the place 
where Waver and Crombok meet, thence up Crombok till it receives Wythe- 
fkeld, fo up that fyke unto the head, then turning weft unto a fyke that 
compaffeth Middlerigg on the north and weft till it fall into Polnewton, fo as 
Polnev/ton falls into the fea, thence along the coaft unto the foot of Wathe- 
pol, and fo up Wathepol unto Kirkbride aforefaid. 

All this was foreft at the firft foundation of the kings: But the monks prefently 
ere&ed five granges for hufbandry, at Raby, at Mawbergh, at Skinburne, at 
Culfhaw, and at Newton Arlofh ; and turned all into tillage, meadow, and

In the year 1301, bifhop Halton being informed, that the inhabitants of 
the village or town near the port in Skinburnese were at a great diftance 
from all manner of divine fervice, grants a power to the abbot and convent of 
Holm Cultram to ereÂ£t a church there, which mould be endowed with all 
manner of tithes, and enjoy all parochial rights. The abbot and convent to 
have the advowfon, and the bifhop of Carlifle and his fucceiTors all ordinary 
jurifdiction. The town of Skinburnefe was at this time not only privileged 
with a market, but feems alfo to have been the chief place for the king's ma- 
gazines in thefe parts for fupplying the armies then employed againft the Scots. 
But the cafe was mod miferably altered very foon after. For in 1305, we find 
it thus mentioned in the parliament records ; " At the petition of the abbot 
" requefting that whereas he had paid a fine of 100 marks to the king for a 
â€¢' fair and market to be had in Skinburnefe, and now that town together with 
" the way leading to it is carried away by the fea, the king would grant that 
" he may have fuch fair and market at his town of Kirkeby Johan inftead of 
" the other place aforefaid, and that his charter upon this may be renewed ; 
" It is anfwered, Let the firft charter be annulled, and then let him have a 
" like charter in the place as he defireth -f." And for the fame reafon, as it 
feemeth, the church alfo was removed to Kirkby Johan or Newton Arlofh: 
For the fame bifhop, by his charter bearing date at Linftock the 1 ith of April 
1303, fetting forth that the lands and poffeffions of the abbot and convent at 
Holm Cultram are far diftant from and not within the limits of any parifh, and 
confidering their impoverifhed condition by the hoftile invafions and depredations 
of the Scots, grants to them licence to build a chapel or church within their 
territory of Arlofh, with all parochial rights, and all the tithes within their ter- 
ritories to the ufe of their monaftery, with power to them to prefent a priefl: 
for inftitution upon a vacancy, allowing him 4/ a year, and room for an houfe 
and curtilage. And in token of fubje&ion, he to pay out of the faid 4/ half 
a mark yearly to the bifhop in the name of a cathedraticum, and 40 d to the 
archdeacon for procurations J. 

The abbey was furrendered to the crown by the abbot Borrowdak, March 6", 
in the 29 Hen. 8. being then valued at 427/ 19^ 3^, which in prefent value 
would amount to upwards of 2000/. The faid abbot was appointed parfon

There is no charge upon this vicarage of firft fruits, tenths, fynodals, or 
procurations. 

The firft vicar that we meet with after the difiblution of the abbey, was Sir 
William Robin/on; who refigning in 1564, Sir George Stubb clerk was inftituted 
on a prefentation by Humphrey Mitchel gentleman who had a grant of this 
avoidance from the chancellor, mafters, and fcholars of the univerfity of Ox- 
ford. 

In 1576, bifhop Barnes (upon lapfe) collates Sir William Adcock to the vi- 
carage of Holme Cultram, alias Newton Arlofh. 

And in the next year, on the ceflion of William Adcock, the fame bifhop 
collates Sir Henry Symfon clerk, to the faid vicarage, as belonging to his gift 
and collation in full right. 

In 1578, on the death of the faid Henry Symfon, bifhop Meye collates in 
like manner Sir Chriftopher Symfon clerk as of his own right. 

In 1 58 1, on the refignation of Chriftopher Symfon, the fame bifhop col- 
lates Sir Edward Mandevil clerk. In whofe time there is the following entry 
in the parifh regifter : Memorandum â€¢, The fteeple of the church, being of the 
height of 19 fathoms, fuddenly fell down to the ground, upon the firft day of 
January in the year 1600, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and by the fall 
thereof brought down a great part of the chancel, both timber, lead, and walls; 
and after the faid fall, the fame continued in a very ruinous condition for the fpace 
of two years ; during which time, there was much lead, wood, and ftone carried 
away. There was prefent at the fall Robert Chamber and myfelf (Edward 
Mandevile, then vicar there) both of us being within the church at the very 
time of the fall, and yet by the good pleafure of God we efcaped all perils. â€” 
In 1602, by means of the bifhop of Carlifle a commifiion was granted by the 
chancellor, mafters, and fcholars of the univerfity of Oxford under their com- 
mon feal, to George Curwen gentleman and me Edward Mandevile, for re- 
edifying a comely and fufficient chancel, taking and having towards the work 
the old materials of the chancel which was fallen and fhrunk, with the price 
of the lead fo fallen to rebuild a new one ; which commifiion was executed by 
me Edward Mandevile accordingly in 1602 and 1603. This work came to 
180/ and odds. â€” This work being finifhed, it fo happened, that upon Wed- 
nefday the 1 8 th of April 1604, one Chriftopher Hardon, carrying a live coal 
and a candle into the roof of the church, to fearch for an iron chifel which his 
brother had left there, and the wind being exceeding ftrong and boifterous, it 
chanced that the coal blew out of his hand into a daw's neft which was within 
the roof of the church, and forthwith kindled the fame, which fet the roof on 
fire, and within lefs than three hours it confumed and burned both the body 
of the chancel, and the whole church, except the fouth fide of the low church, 
which was faved by means of a ftone vault. Upon which great mifhap, Tho- 
mas Chamber and William Chamber did mod untruly and malicioufly put a 
bill into the exchequer, therein alledging that the faid Hardon did burn the 
church wilfully, by the procurement of Thomas Hardon coufin of the faid 
Chriftopher Hardon and me Edward Mandevile, to whom the faid Chriftopher 
was fervant. This falfe accufation they went about to prove by divers wit- 

A a 2 nefies, 



tSo ALLERDALE BELOW DERWENT. (Holm Cultram.) 

neffes, but they failed in the proof; and fo the matter, when it came before 
the court, was difmifTed. â€” In the fame year 1604, I thefaid Edward Mandevile 
did re-edify the chancel of the laid church of my own voluntary will, which coft 
me 88/ and fome odd money. And in the year 1606, the parifhioners were 
commanded by the bifhop to repair the body of the church, who were taxed 
fo to do by the churchwardens and the fixteen men, who were appointed for 
that purpofe. 

The faid Edward Mandevile died foon after, and in the year 1607 Robert 
Mandevile, M. A. was inllituted on a prefentation by the univerfity. 

In 1632, on the death of Thomas Jefferfon late vicar, Charles Robfon, S.T. B. 
was inllituted on a like prefentation ; concerning whom we find a cafe ftated in 
the year 1636, and an advocate's opinion thereupon. Mr. Robfon, being ba- 
chelor of divinity, demanded of the parifh an hood proper to his degree. The 
queftion was, "Whether the ordinary of the place hath power to command the 
churchwardens and parifhioners at their charges to provide an hood for the 
vicar, he being a graduate; becaufe, 1. The faid parifh was never before 
charged in this kind. 2. The vicars there have refpectively either bought 
themfelves hoods, or brought the fame with them. 3. The prefent vicar there 
hath at all times fince his firft coming to his vicarage, which is five years and 
more, worn a hood of his own, at fuch times as by the canons he is injoined 

to wear the fame, till within this half year laft paft. Anfwer. In this cafe I 

am of opinion, that the ordinary cannot compel the churchwardens to provide 
their parilh prieft an hood at the parifh charge, becaufe an hood is habitus fcho- 
lafticus, and doth not belong to a prieft quatenus a prieft, but to a fcholar qua- 
tenus a graduate in the univerfity, where (at leaft in Oxford) every graduate is 
bound habere intra quindenam habitum de proprio gradui competentem. And in 
this cafe, as it is propounded, if the three reaibns be proved, it will make the 
matter ftill more clear that the churchwardens are not to provide the hood ; 
though the ordinary may compel a prieft who is a graduate, to wear his hood, 
according to the 58th canon. 

In 1638, on the death of Charles Robfon, William Head, M. A. was infti- 
tuted on a prefentation by the univerfity.

feems to have been built by Robert Chamber abbot*; there being his rebus 
or device on the infide of the roof, viz. a bear chained to a paftoral ftafFftruck 

* He was abbot here about 26 years in the reigns of king Hen. 7. and king Hen. 8. His three 
brothers Thomas, Richard, and Laurence, it is laid, were all abbots at different places at the fame 
time.

And did frequent the church alwaies: 
Gave alms truely to the poor,

Than all his elders did before. 
He had four children with two wives, 
They died young, the one wife furvives. 
None better of his rank could be

" The infide of the church (the bifhop proceeds) was full of water, the rain 
falling in plentifully every where. The parifhioners about 15 or 16 years be- 
fore took off the lead from the fouth ile (the arches of which are dropping 
down) to cover that on the north. The fabric is large, though only the body 
of the church is ftanding, of nine arches on each ile, and very high." 

Dr. Waugh, the late chancellor, gives the following account : " When 1 
firft came into the jurifdiction, I found both church and chancel in a mod 
ruinous condition. After having often applied to the univerfity by the vice- 
chancellor in vain, I fent out procefs to their farmer, to fhew caufe why the 
tithes mould not be fequeftred - y which made them in earneft fet about the re- 
pair of the chancel, and their example was foon followed (after my viewing 
and threatning a little) by the parifhioners. They now roofed with lead the 
large middle ile, took away the fide iles and part of the chancel, and made 
the whole one good building. It is neatly and conveniently feated with hand- 
fome galleries, and is altogether a beautiful church ; but, though it (lands 
high, ftrangely damp. The body of the church, exclufive of the chancel, 
contains 93 pews, the galleries 48, in all 141 ; and hold, one with another, 
fix people each, in all 846." 

In 1730, it was certified, that there were in this parifh 479 families; of 
which, quakers 30, prefbyterians 4, anabaptifts 4. 

In the year 1607, there being fome controverfy concerning the payment of 
the wages of the parifh clerk or fexton, the fame having been paid in an un- 
certain manner, and the clerk claiming the fame to be paid in meal, and no 
certain meafure thereof afcertained ; it was agreed and ordered by the 16 men, 
with the confent of the other parifhioners, that for the future there fhall be one

The Certificate of Henry lord Scroope lord warden of the Weft Marches 
againft Scotland, Richard Afhton efquire receiver general, Anthony Barwife 
efquire, John Dalfton efquire, and George Lamplugh efquire, commiiTioners 
appointed by virtue of the queen's majefly's commiffion out of the right ho-

the fame did agree with a furvey taken of late by a commiffion remaining of 
record in the court of exchequer, we did not fpend any long time therein, but 
do refer the fame to the laft certificate remaining as is aforefaid. 

We, by virtue of the faid commiffion, did then and there appoint and fwear

fay, to the fon and heir of fuch tenant; and for default of fuch fon, to the 
eldeft daughter or daughters being unmarried; and in their default, to any 
other the next whole blood : And that every heir, after the death of their an- 
ceftors, ought to pay to the lord of the faid manor, for his or their admiffion 
to be tenants, in the name of a fine, for the lands and tenements to him fo 
letten, according to the cuftom of the faid lordfhip, the value of one year's 
rent for the fame cuftomary lands, over and befides the ufual rents for that 
year, and no more : And that like fine ought to be paid to the lord of the faid 
manor upon every alienation of the title of the faid tenants of the faid lord- 
fhip or manor: And that every tenant ought to pay to the lord of the faid ma- 
nor, holding cuftomary lands, at the change of the prince one penny : And

Lthough the manor of Bromfield, and the greatefi: part of the parifh of 
Bromfield, are within the ward of Allerdale below Derwent â€¢, yet a part of 
the faid parifh is within Cumberland Ward, as having been parcel of theeftate 
of the lords of Wigton. Of which part, the firft place is Blencogo, which 
was granted by Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale to Odard de Logis, together 
with Wigton, Kirkbride, Ulton, Waverton, and Dundraw. It continued in 
the pofterity of Odard for feveral generations. 

The firft account that we meet with of it afterwards was in the reign of 
king Henry the feventh, who by letters patent dated May the firft in the

Afterwards, queen Elizabeth by letters patent, March 22, in the 31ft year 
of her reign, grants to Walter Copinger and Thomas Butler of London gentle- 
men (inter alia) the manor of Blencogo with the appurtenances, and all lands, 
tenements, and hereditaments, called or known by the name of Blencogo, 
heretofore in the tenure of Richard Cholmeley knight ; to hold to them 
and their heirs as of the manor of Eaft Greenwich, by fealty only and not 
in capite. 

In the 10 Cha. 1. June 26. Richard Barwife of Ifiekirk elquire, lord of 
the manor of Blencogo, grants to the tenants (18 in number), for 40 years 
ancient rent, that they mail hold to them their heirs and affigns, cuftomary 
eftates of inheritance of their feveral tenements, paying the ancient yearly 
rent, and two years ancient rent (and no other fine) after change of lord by 
death, and change of tenant by death or alienation, doing fuit of court as be- 
fore. Every alienation to be entred at the next court, paying for the entry 
12 d and no more. He grants to them alfo all trees, woods, and underwoods, 
on their refpeftive tenements ; with power to get freeftone and limeftone in 
their feveral grounds, or in any wafte ground within the townfields or com- 
mons, for their own ufe, but not to give or fell the fame to any other. 

The prefent lord of the manor is Mr. Tbomlinfon, now (1770) an infant. 

The vicar of Bromfield is endowed of the great tithes of this townfhip, 
and when the commons came to be inclofed and improved, Mr. Child the 
vicar fuppofing that the great tithes of the faid commons improved were 
included alfo in his endowment, brought his a&ion, which was tried at Carlifle 
affizes, wherein he was nonfuited, thofe tithes appearing to belong to the 
impropriators. 

Galiene daughter of Richard de Hervi gave to the abbey of Holm Cultram 
3 acres of arable land in the territory of Blencoggon, and pafture for 100 
fheep, 28 cows, one bull, and two horfes, for the maintenance of the infirm

Dun draw (Dundragb, an Irifh name, fignifying an hill of oaks) was given 
as aforefaid by Waldieve to Odard de Logis, who gave the fame to Gilbert 
his fon, who thence took the name of Gilbert de Dundraw. After Gilbert fuc- 
ceeded Gilbert his fon. And after him, Mr. Denton fays he had read of one 
Symon de Dundragh in the 17 Hen. 3. But it doth not feem that he held 
the manor. For the four daughters and coheirs of the fecond Gilbert de 
Dundraw did inherit his lands in Dundraw, Crofton, Thackthwait, and Dif- 
tington â€¢, viz. Cicely the wife of Jordon Clapell, who gave her part by fine to

PARISH OF WIGTON. 

Wigton was ancient demefne of Allerdale, until Waldieve fon of Gofpatric 
earl of Dunbar gave that barony unto Odard de Logis. It contained Wigton,

Waverton, Blencogo, Dundraw, and Kirkbride (with Ulton). Which five 
townfhips are feveral manors within themfelves, known by metes and bounds, 
and lie within the barony of Wigton. King Hen. I. confirmed Waldieve's 
grant unto him, and he lived until the reign of king John ; fo that he muft 
have died in a good old age. 

This Odard had iffue Adam, and Adam had iffue Odard the fecond, whofe 
fon and heir Adam the fecond died without iffue ; therefore the inheritance 
came to his brother Walter, who had iffue Odard the third, who died without 
iffue, and another Odard, who alfo died without iffue-, wherefore their brother 
John de Wigton, fon of Walter, entered ; which John had an only daughter 
and heir Margaret, who was married to John Gernoun. In king Edward the 
third's time, me was impleaded for her birthright, and her mother Idyonife 
Lovetot the wife of Sir John de Wigton was for a time hundred of her dower, 
but her adverfary did not prevail. Wigton barony fhortly after her death 
came to Thomas Lucy lord of Allerdale, and thereby in right the feigniory of 
"Wigton was extinguifhed, and became again part of the ancient barony of 
Allerdale, though it is ftill taken and reputed as a diftind barony, From the 
Lucys it came to the earls of Northumberland, together with the reft of the 
Lucy eftate, and is now the property of the prefent earl of Egremont. 

In the Chronicon Cumbria it is faid that the church of Wigton was built by 
the firft Odard de Logis -, and it was given by the lady Margaret de Wigton to 
the abbey of Holm Cultram for their better fupport after the devastations 
made by the Scots. 

It is dedicated to St. Mary-, rated in the king's books at 17/ igsgid; 
certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 32/ 13J4J; and in 
1718 it was augmented by the laid governors. with 2co/, in conjunction with 
250/, given by Mr. John Thomlinfon rector of Rothbury, wherewith lands 
were purchafed near Carlifle, of the prefent yearly value of about 20/. He 
alfo by his will gave a further augmentation of 13/ a year. 

The faid lady Margaret gave alfo the advowfon of this church tothe faid 
abbey, that they might find four chaplains monks of their own houfe to per- 
form divine fervice in the church of the abbey, and two fecular chaplains to 
officiate in a chantry of the church of St. Mary at Wigton, for the foul of

King James the firlt by letters patent granted all the reft of the faid rectory 
(tithes of eggs, geefe, and apples only excepted) to Francis Morice efquire 
and Francis Phelips gentleman ; who in the 13th year of the faid king affigned 
the fame to Richard Fletcher of Cockermouth efquire. 

The faid king in the 5th year of his reign granted the tithes of eggs, geefe, 
and apples, to Lewis Owen efquire and William Blake fcrivener; which the 
houfe of Crofton now enjoys : as do the Fletchers of Hutton all the other 
tithes. 

King Ed. 6. by letters patent dated the 30th day of January in the 3d year 
of his reign, granted to Thomas Dalfton efquire and William Denton gentle- 
man, their heirs and afligns, the free chapel called St. Leonard's kofpital, in the 
parifh of Wigton ; and all the lands, meadows, paftures, feedings, and here- 
ditaments wbatfoever, in the tenure of the relicT of Leonard Thompfon in 
Wigton, and of William Robinfon in the foreft of Weft ward, to the faid free 
chapel belonging. 

The church is a very old building, which feems never to have been rebuilt 
fince Odard's time. In the chancel are three feats, fo large as to fill up moft 
of the fpace below the rails of the communion table. One whereof belongs 
to the impropriator, and is commonly ufed by the officers of the court at vi- 
fitations. Another was built by Mr. Dalton of Oulton, and is enjoyed by the 
prefent owners of his eftate. The third was erected in 1667 by Gawen Cham- 
bers, who (having been fometime a zealous fanatic) was purchafed hereby into 
the church by good bifhop Rainbow, and is now enjoyed by Sir Gilfrid Law- 
fon whofe anceftor purchafed his eftate. 

On the north entrance into the quire, there is a plate of brafs on the wall 
with this infeription : 

" A memorative epitaph for the worthy and loving Colonel Thomas 
Barwife, who died the 15 day of December 1648. iEcatis fuse 27. 
Stay, pafienger, for there bold Barwife lies, 
Whofe fancted fpirit foars above the Ikies.

For more command, of comely body, pious heart. 
Dear to his people, country, kindred dear, 
Dear to his known aflbciates every where.

And dying Colonel, lives crowned ,fure." 
This Thomas was father to the laft Mr. Barwife of Ilekirk, elder brother to 
captain William Barwife of Huddlefceugh and fometime of Warton. 

Under the eves of the north fide both of the church and chancel are feveral 
antique fculptures-, which have occafioned a tradition that thefe ftones were 
brought from the ruins of Old Carlifle. 

Incumbents of this parifh that have occurred are as follows : 
-Before the grant of this church to the monaftery by Margaret de Wigton-, 
James de Dalilegh, in the year 1308, on a preientation by Sir John de Wyg- 
geton (father of the faid Margaret) was instituted tÂ© the vacant rectory of

Belonging to this church is a pretty large parochial library. 

In 1730, there were in this parifli 479 families ; of which, diffenters (chiefly 
quakers) 63. 

There are in this parifli and town of Wigton two public charitable foun- 
dations, to wit, The college of matrons or hofpital of Chrift, and the Gram- 
mar School. 

The Hospital (lands near the north fide of the churchyard, and was founded 
in 1 725 by Robert Thomlinfon, D. D re&or of Whickham in the county of 
Durham, and John Thomlinfon rector of Glenfield in the county of Leicefter, 
executors of the laft will and teftament of John Thomlinfon, M. A. rector of 
Rothbury in the county of Northumberland, for fix indigent widows of pro- 
teftant beneficed clergymen epifcopally ordained, and incorporated by the name 
of governefs and fillers of the college of matrons or hofpit A of Chrift in Wig- 
ton in the county of Cumberland; and endowed by them with a yearly rent 
of 48/ iffuing out of lands in Eafter Haughton in the parifli of Simondburn in 
the county of Northumberland, and a yearly rent of 6/ iffuing out of two 
clofes in the parifli of Gatefliead in the county of Durham. 

No widow to be admitted under 46 years of age, and to be the widow of 
a proteftant prieft epifcopally ordained and beneficed either in the diocefe of 
Carlifle, or in that part of Cumberland which is in the diocefe of Chefter, or 
who had ferved as a curate therein for two years at leaft at the time of his 
death, or elfe was rector of Rothbury or of Whickham or had ferved two years 
as curate there at the time of his death. The widows of beneficed priefts to 
be preferred to the widows of curates. The widows of clergymen related to 
the founders, or of their firname, to be preferred before all others. Next to 
them, the widows of the rectors of Rothbury and Whickham : And the wi- 
dows of curates of thefe two livings, before all other widows of curates. The 
widow of the vicar of Wigton (if he died treafurer), before the widows of 
other beneficed clergymen within the diocefe of Carlifle. The widows of be- 
neficed priefts and curates within the diocefe of Carlifle, before the widows of 
all clergymen within that part of Cumberland which is in the diocefe of Chef- 
ter. â€” By beneficed priefts are to be underftood lecturers, perpetual curates, or 
chaplains of chapels, as well as redtors and vicars : and by curates are to be 
underftood ftipendiary curates. â€” And not to be at any time above one widow 
of any one living. And none to be admitted who hath an income of 10/ a 
year or 200/ in goods.

beck, and the vicars of Bromfield and Wigton to be governors : If the chan- 
cellor live out of the diocefe, or become unable or unwilling to act, then his 
official or fubftitute to act as governor: And if any of the incumbents of the 
faid four livings fhall refufe, or be non-refident for two years together ; the 
remaining governors to chufe others for that turn, out of the incumbents of 
Torpenhow, Afpatric, Bolton, and Plumland. 

The founders to be vifitors during their lives â€¢, after that, Mr. William 
Thomlinfon of Blencogq and his heirs, till the end of 60 years from the date

the time being for ever. 

On a vacancy of the govemefs or any of the fillers, the place to be kept 
void for 30 days ; and the governors, within 21 days after that, (hall fill up the 
vacancy : If the votes are equal, the vifuor to chufe for that time. 

The governors (ball alio have power to correct, and punidi by mulct or 
(after three admonitions) by expulfion ; with a faving, in cafe of expulfion, 
of an appeal to the vifitor. 

The governors to have power from time to time to make new ftatutes, pro- 
vided they be not contrary to thofe of the founders. 

In cafe of precedency, next after the governefs, widows of graduates to be 
preferred to thofe of undergraduates, but otherwife the widows of each to 
take place according to the feniority of their admiMion, unlefs there was a 
great inequality in the preferments and univerfity degrees conferred on their 
hufbands, in which cafe the graduates of Oxford and Cambridge fhall always 
be preferred to the Irifh, and the Irifh to the Scotch. 

A matron having children, fhall not keep any of them in her apartment af- 
ter the age of 16 or 17, unlefs a daughter that is fickly or fhe herfelf be fickly 
or infirm, in which cafe (he (with leave) may have a daughter or fervant.

The vicar of Wigton to be treafurer, for which he fhall have 20 s yearly. 
And he fhall pay yearly to the governefs 8/ 10 s od, and to each of the five 
fitters 8 /. 

And there fhall be a general meeting once a year, on a day to be appointed 
by the chancellor of Carhfle in May, June, or July â€¢, but if he do not appoint 
a day before Midfummer, then on the firfl Thurfday in July ; for auditing the 
accounts, viewing the hofpital, and making orders concerning the fame : the 
treafurer to lay out 10 or 14s for a dinner for the truflees, and 6s for a dinner 
to the matrons. 

Mrs. Reed of Newcaflle upon Tyne, fitter of Dr. Thomlinfon, gave 100/ to 
this hofpital, for which a rent charge of 3/ 10s was procured on fome lands 
at Blencogo ; and there is a further addition to the revenues of this hofpital by 
another rent charge of 61 from the fame lands. 

[A capital error in moft of thefe charitable foundations is, in charging a 
pecuniary fum ifluing out of lands, which fum almofl every year diminifhea 
in value : If lands had been given, the value of the lands would have in- 
creafed in proportion as the value of money decreafeth.]

The other charitable foundation at Wigton is the school. The firft eflay 
towards it was made by the faid Mr. Thomlinfon of Rothbury about the year 
1 7 14; which was an offer to the parifhioners, that if they would contribute 
thereto according to their abilities, he would give 100/ towards erecting a free 
grammar fchool, and procure another 100/ from his relations. Accordingly, 
they fet about it; and, by a method agreed to among themfelves, they raifed 
200/. That money of theirs Mr. Thomlinfon took into his own hands -, and 
for that, and the 200/ given by himfelf and his relations, he made over to 
the fchool an annuity of 20 /for ever, payable out of the eftate at Haughton 
aforefaid. Since that time, an additional ftock of 80/ was raifed, which is let 
out at intereft for the benefit of the mafter. At firft there was no fchoolhoufe, 
and they were forced to hire one, which lefTened the matter's falary confiderably. 
Whereupon Dr. Thomlinfon of Wickham did generoufly propofe to the pa- 
rifhioners, that if they would find him a proper piece of ground to build on, 
and lead the materials, he would erect not only an houfe to teach in, but alfo 
a dwelling for the mafter. This propofal was readily agreed to, and the doc- 
tor built the houfes accordingly at the expence of 125/. And over the door 
of the fchoolhoufe is the following infcription :

It is faid, that Mr. Thomlinfon of Rothbury intended to have the nomina- 
tion of the mafter vefted in the vicar and a certain number of truftees, but he 
died before any thing of that kind was effected. And every one who was a 
contributor claims an equal right in the choice of a mafter-, and the claimants 
being very numerous, there is likely to be much confufion, until they can 
agree to intruft the nomination in a felect number. 

In 1756, Mr. Barnes of Dockray left 5/ to this fchool. 

Under the monument of the aforefaid Mr. John Thomlinfon, in the chancel â€¢â€¢ 
of the parifh church of Rothbury, upon a fquare piece of marble, are the fol- 
lowing benefactions recorded : 

To the parifh of Rothbury for ever, the eftates of Shaperton, Harbottle, 
and Todhills, of the yearly value of 33/ io.f od. 

To the fchool at Rothbury, a rent charge out of an eftate in Bickerton in 
that parifh 20 /.

PARISH OF AIKTON. 

Aikton (a town of oaks) is the next pari(h north eaft from Wigton. It is 
a manor within the barony of Burgh upon the fands, and was the principal feat 
of Johan de Morville fecond daughter and one of the two coheirs of Sir Hugh 
Morville lord of Burgh. A little hamlet here, now called Downhall (and 
ever fo named after the Scots burnt it) was the capital mefluage of Aikton, 
where the faid Johan and her hufband Sir Richard Gernon lived. The faid 
Johan died in the 3 1 Hen. 3, and had two daughters Helwife and Ada. Ada 
the younger was married to Randolph Boyvill of Levington, and afterwards 
to William Furniville : She died in the 55 Hen. 3. and her daughter and heir 
Hawife, did fucceed in the inheritance of Ada and of Randolph de Levington 
her hufband. Hawife died foon after her mother without ifiue ; therefore the 
lands of Randolph Boyvill of Levington fell to his fix fillers coheirs, and her 
fourth parr, to wit, the moiety of her grandmother's moiety of the Morvill's 
lands came to Roger fon of Walter Colvill and of Margaret his wife, in right 
of the faid Margaret, who was daughter and heir of Helwife elder daughter of 
Johan de Morvill and wife of Euftace Baliol. The faid Helwife died in the 
34 Hen. 3. and her daughter Margaret in the 9 Ed. 1. Roger Colvill, fon of 
the faid Margaret, and in her right lord of Aikton, was fucceeded by his fon 
Edward Colvill; and after him, Robert Colvill was found heir. In the 23 Ed. 1. 
Thomas Daniel died lord of the fame, in right of Jfabel his wife the heir of 
Colvill; and left his daughter Margaret a child of three years of age his heir; 
who in the 4 Ed. 3. intailed the land to her hufband John Radcliffe and herfelf 
for life ; remainder to Richard their fon for life ; then to Robert, Thomas, 
Richard, and John, fons of the faid Richard, and their heirs fucceffively in 
tail male ; then to the heirs male of Henry fon of Catharine Chiftley ; then 
to the heirs male of John fon of William Radcliffe of Longfield ; after to the 
heirs male of Robert fon of William fon of Richard Radcliffe -, after to the 
right heirs of Margaret Daniel (the grandmother) for ever. She died in the 
44 Ed. 3. Afterwards this manor was fold, in the reign of Hen. 6. to the 
lord Thomas Dacre, and thereby became united to the ancient feigniory of 
Burgh (as it ftill continues), from which it had been feparated by the partition 
between the two daughters and coheirs of Hugh de Morvill aforefaid. 

Gamelsby within this parifh (lands on the north fide of the river Wam- 
pool, between it and the fields of Aikton. It is called in ancient evidences 
Gamelfby nigh Aikton, to diflinguifh it from another place of the fame name on 
the north fide of the river Eden. It contains the two hamlets of Gamelfby and 
Biglands, which latter is fo called from that kind of grain called big (a Ipecies 
of barley) growing plentifully there. Thefe two hamlets were anciently a 
manor, and the chief or capital mefluage flood at Gamelfby, and was fo called 
of one Gamel who built it and inhabited there'-, before whofe time, it was a 
woody wafte frequented with deer. It was anciently part of Burgh, and 

granted

granted forth to one William Brewer by the Barons of Burgh to be holden as 
a part of the faid barony, as the baron held the fame of the king. The next 
lord that we meet with was Adam de Crookdake, who had it by fine of William 
Brewer. Afterwards it defcended by two daughters to the family of the 
Raughlons and Boyvills lords of Weftlinton. Raughton'% part defcended to a 
daughter named Catharine wife of John Afpilon a Buckinghamshire man, who 
foldÂ°the fame to the Warcops, and they to the Crackenthorps or Soutbaiks, who 
exchanged the fame with the Bentons of Cardew for their land in Skelton : 
One of the pofterity of the Dentons fold the fame to the feveral inhabitants 
and tenants of that part. The other moiety (the Levington's part) defcended. 
long in the heir male, till by a daughter it was transferred to Alexander High- 
more of Harbybrow, whofe heir fold the fame to the lord Dacre, and it has 
ever fince been enjoyed along with the barony of Burgh. 

Wathinpool, or Wampool, lies next unto Biglands and Gamelfby, and is 
fo called of the river Wampool becaufe it (lands upon the banks of the fame. 
The eldeft that we read of that was lord thereof was one Robert Brune fon 
of Radulph, who was called Robert de Wathinpole. He married Margaret 
daughter and heir of Richard de Trute lord of Newby beneath Carlifle. 
This family took their name from the place, and were called Wathinpoles. 
Afterwards the Warwicks of Warwick were lords thereof, whofe heir Richard 
Warwick fold the fame to the inhabitants, who are now freeholders of the 
barony of Burgh. 

Leathes is a hamlet next unto Wampool, and was fo called from a grange 
or farm which the lord of Whitrigg had there. Of this place the family of 
Leathes took their furname, which anciently well nigh the conqueft enjoyed 
the fame ; and it defcended in the ifTue male until Adam de Leathes, in the 
reign of queen Elizabeth, fold the fame to the inhabitants. We call a barn 
for corn a leath, whereupon the place was fo called, being a very good corn foil, 
and fo kept conftantly in tillage. It was part of the demefne of Whitrigg, fo 
called being a long white ridge upon the banks of Wathempool, which 
belonged to an ancient family of the name of Brun, who afterwards from the 
place of their refidence in Scotland took the name of Lunbritton, and their 
pofterity at this place took the name of Whitrigg. 

The church of Aikton is reclorial, and dedicated to St. Andrew. It is 
valued in the king's books at 14/ 3 s \\JL And the improved yearly value is 
now 200/ or upwards. In 1730 there were in this parifh 128 families j of 
which, Quakers 4, and no other diffenter. 

This church of ancient time was prefented unto by moieties, which perhaps 
might be firft occafioned by the divifion of the Morvil eftate between the two 
daughters of Sir Hugh Morvil, Ada married into the Multon family, and 
Johan married (as aforefaid) to Gernon. 

In the year 1304, on the death of William de Aldewerk, Thomas de Multon 
of Gillefiand prefents William de Somer/et to a moiety of the church of Ayke-

Ayketon protefted that there was no fuch vacancy as was pretended, for that 
he himfelf was re&or of the whole. And towards confolidating the laid 
rectory, Richard de Ayketon refigns his title. Neverthelefs, in the regifter, 
there preiectly follows an inftitution and mandate for induction to -the faid 
moiety, of the aforementioned William de Somerfet. 

Two years after, William de Somerfet refigns his moiety ; and Richard de 
JJkelly was inftituted into it, on the prefentation of the faid Thomas de 
Multon lord of Gilledand. 

In 1339, on the death of Robert de Halghton, William de Salkeld is prefented 
to a moiety of the rectory of Ayketon by Margaret de Dacre, who dates her 
prefentation from Kirkofwald. And upon an inquifition of the right of 
patronage the jurors find the aforcfaid lady Margaret (heirefs of the Multon 
family, and relict of Ralph lord Dacre) the true patronefs ; and accordingly 
the faid William has inftitution, and a mandate to Thomas le Spencer (rector of 
the other moiety) to induct him. 

In 1362, William Beauchamp was admitted to a moiety, on the prefentation 
of Ralph lord Dacre. 

And two years after, on the refignation of the faid William Beauchamp, 
inftitution was given to Sir William Chamberlayne by the fame title. 

In 13 7 1, Robert de Kirkby was rector of a moiety of Aketon, as appears 
by his will dated in that year. 

In 1373, on the refignation of Sir Thomas de Hutton, Sir Thomas Roke was 
prefented by Ralph lord Dacre to a moiety, and inftituted thereupon. 

In 1378, Hugh de Dacre lord of Gilledand, knight, prefents Sir John de 
Kerby to a moiety of Aketon, vacant by the death of Sir John de Midylton ; 
and William rector of Bownefs, vicar general in the bifhop's abfence, gives 
him inftitution. 

In 1465, a writ of Quare impedit was brought by Sir John Savage knight, 
claiming the right of prefentation againft the bifhop and Richard Morland ; 
but Richard Morland continued rector (of the whole, as it feemeth, for after 
this we find nothing more of the moieties). 

In the reign of king Hen. 7. we find Chriftopher Caunefield, rector of Ake- 
ton, witnefs to divers inftruments. 

In 1509, the lalt year of that king's reign, Robert Lowthe rector of Aketon 
-was witnefs to a releafe of the manor of Glafion to Thomas lord Dacre. 

In 1542, Nicholas Crawhall was rector. 

In 1563, on the death of John Blyth rector of Aketon, William Lowden 
was inftituted on the prefentation of William Dacre knight, lord Dacre. 

In 1572, on William J^owden's death, Robert Allan by was inftituted on a 
prefentation by queen Elizabeth. Which Robert refigncd in 1583, and feems 
to have been fucceeded by^Rowtand Hauxbie \ for in 1591 Rowland Hauxbie

In 1598, Sir Thomas Blayne clerk was inflituted (during the vacancy of the 
fee) by the archbifhop of York, who wrote the fame day to the archdeacon of 
Carlifle to give him induction (the patron not mentioned). 

In 1642, Feb. 7. on the death of Thomas Blayne, a caveat was entred by 
"William Head vicar of Holm Cultram, on the behalf of his brother Thomas 
Head ; who on the 7th of March following was inflituted by archbifhop 
Williams then refiding in Wales, on the prefentation of Thomas Dennis a 
mercer in Oxford. And a monition was fent by the faid archbifhop to the 
archdeacon of Carlifle to give induction thereupon. [Dr. Ufher was then 
and had been about a year bifhop of Carlifle ; but archbifhop Williams was 
then begun to incline to the parliament party.] 

In 1650, Sir Arthur Haflerig and other commiflioners for propagating the 
gofpel in the four northern counties ejected Mr. Lam-pit out of the re&ory of 
Aketon, upon account of his not having been legally prefented thereto ; and 
fettled there Mr. Rowland Nichols an able and painful preacher-)-. This Mr. 
Nichols conformed after the Restoration, and in 1667 was made chancellor 
of the diocefe. He refigned the chancellorfhip in 1683, and died in 1694; 
and was fucceeded in the rectory of Aketon by R. Threlkeld, B. A. on the 
prefentation of Sir John Lowther of Lowther baronet. 

In 1707, on R. Threlkeld's death, Richard Holme, M. A. was prefented by 
Richard lord vifcount Lonfdale, a minor. 

In 1739, on Mr. Holme's death, William Lindfey, M. A. was prefented by 
Henry vifcount Lonfdale. 

In 1753, on William Lindfey's death, Henry Lowther, M. A. was prefented 
by Sir James Lowther of Lowther baronet, with the confent of his mother 
and guardian Mrs. Katherine Lowther. 

PARISH OF THURSBY. 

Thursby (Thor's town) fo called from the Saxon deity from whom we 
derive our word Thurfday, is the next parifh towards the fouth eaft. Alan 
fecond lord of Allerdale gave Thurfby to Herbert le Brun who was firft lord 
thereof, and he took the furname de Thurjly. His female heir carried the 
inheritance to Guido Boyvill a younger fon of the houfe of Levington. He 
had iffue William, who had a brother John, who were both knights and 
forelters in Allerdale from Shawk to Elne, which was the Weft Ward of the 
foreft of Inglewood ; which office defcended to them from the faid Herbert. 
In the 27 hd. 1. Sir William de Boyvill knight held the fame. And in the 34 
Ed. 1. John de Boyvill knight. Soon after, we find Robert de Ogle lord 
thereof-, whofe fon Thomas de Ogle, in the 38 Ed. 3. being then under age, 
prefented a rector to the church of Thurfby. In rhe 9 Ed. 4. it is found by 
inquifition, that Sir Robert Ogle knight then held the manor of Thorefby, 
with the advowfon of the church there, of the lord Dacre as of his barony of

Burgh, by knights fervice. Afterwards it came to the Dacres, who held ther 
fame united to and as parcel of the faid barony of Burgh. And amongft the 
knights fees in the 35 Hen. 8. William lord Bacre held the fame of the king 
by knights fervice, and 25 s S^d cornage. And from that time it hath 
continued to be enjoyed by the owners of the faid barony, as part and 
parcel thereof. 

Next to Thurfby lies Crofton in this parilh, being fituate between Thurfby 
and Parton towards the eaft and weft, and between the rivers of Wampole 
and the Pow on the fouth and north. It is called Crofton from the word 
croft, as the town Handing upon or having many crofts. Mr. Denton fays, 
the firft lord of Crofton that he had met with was a knight Sir Gilbert fon of 
Gilbert de Bundraw, who lived in king John's time. He gave a parcel of 
Crofton to the hofpital of St. Nicholas at Carlifle, and bound that land to 
grind at his mill at Crofton. He had daughters coheirs; one of whom, Ada, 
was married to Stephen de Crofton ; after whom there was John de Crofton, 
Robert de Crofton, John de Crofton, and Clement de Crofton who died in the 
43 Ed. 3. and was fucceeded by his fon Sir John de Crofton, whofe daughter 
and heir Margaret de Crofton was married about the 14 Ric. 2. to I/old Brifcv 
of Brifco in this county, whereby the Brifcoes became poffeffed of the manor 
of Crofton, in which name and family it continues till this day. 

Brifco is a corruption of Birkjkeugh, or Birch-wood. It is a place nigh New- 
biggin in a lordfhip belonging to the priory of Carlifle, which place the 
Brifcoes enjoyed at that time. And when Gualo cardinal of St. Martin in 
king John's time, and after him Randolph in king Henry the third's time, 
made diftribution of the lands belonging to the church of Carlifle between the 
bifhop and the prior (which till then were holden undivided till the faid 
cardinal as legate from the pope divided them) the faid firft named John de-

PARISH OF KIRKBRIDE. 

The church at this place was founded before the conqueft, and dedicated 
to the honour of a religious Irifh woman of great fanctity called Brydoch, and 
corruptly St. Bride, which gave name to the town. It is parcel of the barony of 
Wigton, and was firft granted forth from the fame by Adam fon of Odard fecond 
baron of Wigton in king John's time, to Adam his fecond fon a knighr, and 
brother to Odard the fecond of that name, who was the third baron of Wig- 
ton. His pofterity, as was nfual in thofe days, took their name from thepla.ce, 
and were ftyled de Kirkbride. Adam fon of Adam had iffue Richard de Kirk- 
bride, and Richard had iffue Robert, who dying without iffue was fucceeded 
by his brother Richard in the 23 Ed. 1. Richard had iffue Walter, who was 
knight of the fhire in the 9 Ed. 2. whofe iffue male for feveral defcents, all of 
the name of Richard y enjoyed the manor of Kirkbride, until a coheir of George 
Kirkbride, the laft of that houfe, transferred a moiety thereof to the Daljions 
of Dalftonhall. The other moiety went off with the other coheir, whofe pof- 
terity fold the fame to the lord paramount of Wigton, where it continued till 
Henry the fixth earl of Northumberland gave it with the reft of his patrimony 
to king Henry the eighth, who by letters patent in the 35th year of his reign 
granted the fame to Thomas Daljlon efquire, whereby the Daljions became entire 
lords of the whole manor. Accordingly it is found by inquifition in that 
year, that Thomas Dal/ion efquire held of the king in capite by knights fervice 
the town and manor of Kirkbride with the appurtenances, as of his manor of 
Wigdon, rendring for the fame yearly 13 s 4//cornage, for puture pf the fer- 
jeants 22 d, feawake 16 d, and fuit of court at Wigdon from 3 weeks to 3 
weeks. It continued in the Daljlon family till about the year 1764, when Sir 
George Daljlon baronet, the laft of the name at Dalfton hall, fold the fame to 
Jojeph IVilfon of Pomfret efquire the prefent owner. 

The tenants of the manor are about 40 in number-, 13 of whom purchafed 
their eftates to freehold (heriots included) for five fines and an half at the 
rate of a twenty penny fine, of the faid Sir George Dalfton about the year

1763. The ancient cuftomary rent of the whole manor was 14/ 14.S od- t the 
remaining rent is 7/ 10 s od upon the tenements not infranchifed, for which 
they pay a twenty penny fine, and a heriot upon the death of the tenant, and 
no other duties or fervices but fuit of court. 

The church is rectorial, and valued in the king's books at 5/. It was cer- 
tified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 44/; and is now worth 
about 60/. There are only about 55 families in the whole parifh ; of which, 
Quakers 4, and one Preibyterian. 

In the year 1341, on an inquifition de jure patronatus it appeared, that Sir 
John de Wefton knight was the true patron of the vacant rectory of Kirkbride. 
And thereupon a commifllon was granted to Nicholas de Whytrigg rector of 
Caldbeck to give inftitution to the faid Sir John's prefentee Robert de Bromfield -, 
who refigning in the next year, the faid Sir John de Wefton prefents John de 
Mijlerton, who upon his inftitution contracts to pay 60 millings to the bifhop, 
whereof 30 at Martinmafs and 30 at Candlemafs next following. â€” On this 
prefentation it was found, that Sir John de Wefton was patron in right of the 
lady Joan de Wigton his wife.

PARISH OF BOWNESS. 

Bowness, Bulnefs, is the common name of the manor, town, and parifh 5 
and is parcel of the barony of Burgh : one of the firft barons whereof after 
the conqueft gave it to Gamel le Brun, whole pofterity enjoyed the fame for 
many generations. Their capital meffuage was at Drumbugh, which being 
near the wild wafles, they were promifcuoufly called de la Feritate. Richard ie 
Brun, and after him Robert le Brun, enjoyed it in king Edward the firft's time ; 
Richard le Brun, in the reign of Edward the fecond ; Robert le Brun in the 
reign of Edward the third ; and John Brun in the reign of Richard the fecond. 
1 The 



CUMBERLAND WA R "D. (Bowness.) 2*3 

The laft of this name and family at Bownefs was Richard le Brun, who had 
three daughters coheirs ; one, called Hellen, married to the houfe of Work- 
ington â€¢, another, to the Harringtons of Harrington ; and the third to one 
Bowet. After whom, this manor in procefs of time became again united to 
and confolidated with the barony of Burgh. 

The village of Bownefs is fituate on the fouth fide of the Solway frith, at 
the weftern extremity of that memorable Roman work commonly called the 
Piclswall; extending from hence quite acrofs the ifland, through this county 
and Northumberland, unto the German ocean, being of the length of 63 
Englifh miles and 3 furlongs. 

Mr. Denton as alfo Mr. Camden think this was the B'latum Bulgium of the 
Romans i but Mr. Horfley feems to prove from the diftances, that this Bulnefs 
was not the Blatum Bulgium (which Mr. Camden only conjectured to be fo 
from the fimilarity of the names), but that this was the ftation called by the 
Romans Tunnocelum ; and that Blatum Bulgium was at Middleby on the Roman 
way, on the oppofite fide of Solway frith. 

This work was firft a line of forts or Jlations built by Agricola. Thefe fta- 
tions were generally oblong, comprehending three or four acres of ground, 
with houfes therein or barracks for foldiers, and buildings all about near to the 
fame, in nature of a town : fo that ajlation was in effect a fmall town fortified. 
Thefe ftations at a medium were about four miles diftantfrom each other ; but 
they were clofer or nearer together where there was moil danger, and where 
there was lefs danger they were further off. 

Communicating with, and as it were connecting thefe ftations, the emperor 
Hadrian built a vaft wall of turf, fometimes mixed with ftone, with a ditch 
on the north fide thereof three yards deep, and near four yards over ; a large 
military way accompanying the wall all along. And behind this wall, on the 
fouth fide, another wall or rampart with a ditch, about five paces diftant from 
the former. 

Within this, on the north fide towards the enemy, by way of further and 
ftronger fortification, the emperor Severus built a wall of freeftone; and in 
fome places where the foundation was not good, they made ufe of oaken piles: 
It was faced with hewn ftone, and the inner part (as appears from what re- 
mains of it) filled after a remarkable manner ; the filling ftones are generally 
pretty large, and moftly broad and thin ; thefe are always fet edgeways, and 
ufually not erect, but fomewhat obliquely ; upon thefe the running mortar or 
cement has been poured, and by this contrivance (together with the great 
ftrength of their cement in moft places) the whole wall hath been bound as 
firm as a rock *. This wall of Severus was about four yards high, and from 
feven feet four inches to nine feet thick â€¢, and his ditch (on the north fide) 
wider and deeper than that of Hadrian-, with a paved military way on the 
fouth fide thereof about feventeen foot broad. Between (he Jlations, there were 
caftles (caftella) erected along this wall, generally about 66 foot fquare, and 
between fix and feven furlongs diftant from each other. And between thefe

again, there were turrets, about four yards fquare at the bottom, at thediftance 
one from another of about 308 yards, wherein were centinels placed \vith:n call 
of each other, without having recourfe to the fiction of a founding trumpet or 
pipes under ground f. 

At this ftation of Bulnefs or Tunnocelum the Cohors Mlia Chjfica were in gar- 
rifon ; which, from the fignification of the word clajfxca and the vicinity of that 
place to the fea, feem to have been marines. Bifhop Giblun fays, there have 
frequently been found here Roman coins and infcriptions, and that there was 
lately dug up a fmall brazen figure of a Mercury, or a victory, which came 
into the poffeffion of John Aglionby efquire \. Mr. Horfley fays, that he could 
not fee nor hear of any infcriptions remaining there. That which is at Appleby 
fchool in Weftmorland feems (he fays) to have ccme from Bulnef, but is no 
original: However, it is an argument that fome Roman infcriptions, as well 
as other antiquities, have formerly been found there ; for Mr. Bainbrigg (the 
fchoolmafter) had an humour of cutiing out or copying upon Hones any Ro- 
man infcriptions which came in his way ; of which fort this manifefily appears 
to be, becaufe in his ufual manner he hath annexed what he took to be the Ro- 
man name of Bulnefs, namely, Blatum Bulgium. The whole is as follows ; 

IMP. M. AVRE 

TRIVMPHAI 

PERSAR 

MARC. AVREL: 

PH1LO 
BLATI BULGII. 

The three fir ft lines, Imperatori Marco Aurelio triumphatori Per/arum, have been 
evidently a copy of fome Roman infeription found at Bulnefs; the laft three, 
Marco Aurelio Pbilofopho Blati Bulgii, ieem to be Mr. Bainrigg's own comment 
upon it, with a defign to (hew, that this monument was found at Bulnefs (which 
he believed to be Blatum Bulgium), and that the emperor M-srcus Aureliu?, 
called the philofopher, was intended in the infeription *. 

At Drumbugh (the Gabrojentumoi the Romans) is a fort about five chains 
fquare, whofe ramparts are large, and the ditch very deep. Out of this fort 
abundance of (tones have been taken. It is very probable, that the houfe and 
garden walls have been built with the (tones of the wall and ftation, and that 
it has the name of caftle from the old Roman fort ; for the feat is not built in 
the form of a caftle fj. 

The name Drumbugh (Drumbogh) is derived from that fenny mire or bog 
frequented with bitterns, which are here called mire-drums ; fo that the word 
Drumbug fignifies the bittern's fen. 

The church alfo hath probably been built out of the ruins of the ftation. 
It is dedicated to St. Michael, and the advowfon is and hath been all along ap- 
pendent to the manor. It is rectorial, and valued in the king's books at 

t Horfley's Brit. Rom. 120. % Camd. 1017. * Horfley 267, || Ibid. 157.

PARISH OF BURGH UPON SANDS. 

The large barony of Burgh lies upon the north fide of the river Wathim- 
: pool, which towards the north-weft is wafhed by the fea flowing up into the 
foot of the river Eden, and by the faid river towards the north-eaft to a place 
called Boonby gill â€¢, from thence it adjoins upon the manor of Dalfton to Neel- 
houfe bars ; then to Jack dyke, and down Jack dyke to the river of Wampool 
aforefaid. In this barony are divers manors holden of Burgh â€¢, and fome with- 
in this boundary, yet no part of the barony (as Orton andCrofton) nor holden 
of the fame. 

This barony was given by the earl Ranulph de Mefchiens to Robert de EJlrivers 
or Trevers who married a filter of the faid Ranulph. He gave alfo to the faid 
Robert the chief forefier's office in the foreft of Englewood ; which office, with 
great and many liberties belonging to the fame, all the lords of Burgh enjoyed 
fucceffively, until Thomas de Multon of Gilfland forfeited the fame by treafon 
againft king Henry the third in the infurrection made by Simon de Montfort 
earl of Leicefter. 

This Robert de Treiers had a daughter and heir Ibria Trevers married to Ra- 
nulph Engayn lord of Ifell. Which Ibria and Ranulph her hufbandgave Hen- 
rickby, otherwife Herriby, near Carlifle to the priory there, which gift Hugh 
Morvil confirmed. 

The faid Ranulph Engayn had ifilie William Engayn ; who had ifilie a daughter 
and heir Ada Engayn, who by marriage transferred this barony of Burgh to the 
Morvils. She was married to Simon de Morvill, fon of Hugh de Morvill who in

Roger 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Burgh) 2if 

Roger de Morvill, elder fon of Simon, had iflue a fon and heir Hugh de Mor- 
vill, who was one of thofe four knights who in the 17 Hen. 2. murdered 
Thomas a Becket archbifhop of Canterbury : which done, they entred the 
archbifhop's (tables, and taking away his horfes rode to Knarefburgh in York- 
fhire (a town belonging to this Hugh) where they (laid till all the inhabitants 
were weary of them. Mr. Denton fays, the fword that killed Becket was in 
his father's time at Ifell, which place belonged to the Morvils as heirs of En- 
gain ; after that, the faid fword remained with the houfe of Arundel. â€” The 
faid Hugh took to wife Helewife de Stutevill, with whom he had the manors 
of Kirkofwald and Lafingby, and in the fecond year of king John he obtained 
licence to indole his woods in Kirkofwald, as likewife to fortify his manor houfe 
and to have a fair there once every year with a market every week. Moreover 
he gave unto the king 15 marks and 3 good palfreys to enjoy his court, with 
the liberties of toll, theam, infangthief, fire and water ordeal, and all other fuch 
privileges as belonged to the crown, during the continuance of Helewife his 
wife in a regular habit. â€” He had alfo confiderable pofleflions in Weftmorland. 

He had lffue only two daughters, Ada and Joan. Ada was married in his 
life-time to Richard fon of Reginald de Lucy of Egremont, and afterwards was 
married to Thomas de Mutton. Jean the younger daughter was married, after 
her father's death, to Richard Gernun. Whereupon in the 6 Joh. upon parti- 
tion of the lands of this Hugh betwixt thefe his daughters and coheirs, Ri- 
chard de Lucy gave a fine to the king of 900 marks and five palfreys for the 
purparty of Ada his wife and forelterfhip of Cumberland, as fully as he the 
faid Hugh enjoyed the fame : And Richard Gernun gave 600 marks for liberty 
to marry Joan, with the purparty belonging to her of thofe lands whereof her 
father died feifed. 

Ada to her firft hufband Richard de Lucy had only two daughters Amabil and 
Alice. To her fecond hufband Thomas de Mult on (he had a fon Thomas de Mut- 
ton, heir to her purparty of the Morvil's lands. Which Thomas thefon, in the 25 
Hen. 3. paying 40/ for a fine, had livery of his lands ; and being forefter of 
Cumberland by defcent from Ada his mother, paid a fine of 400 marks the 
next year to the king for trefpafling in that foreft, and to enjoy all thofe liber- 
ties which his anceftors had ufed in that office, excepting the pleas of vert. â€” 
And in the next enfuing year he obtained to himfelf and Maud his wife daugh- 
ter and heir to Hubert de Vaux baron of GilOand a charter of free warren in 
all his demefne lands, in Cumberland, Yorkfliire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, and 
that they and their heirs after the deceafe of Maud de Vaux her mother (then 
the wife of William Everard) (hould have free warren in all the demefne lands 
they held in the counties of Somerfet and Devon, being of the dowry of her 
the faid Maud the mother, and of the inheritance of Maud the daughter. â€” 
In the 42 Hen. 3. he received fummons to prepare himfelf with horfe and arms, 
and to march with the reft of the northern barons into Scotland for refcuing 
the king of Scots then in minority and in reftraint by his own fubjecls : So 
likewife to be at Chefler on Monday next before the feaft of St. John Baptift

Which Thomas de Mult on, upon the death of Helwife de Levington (56* 
Hen. 3.) widow of Euftace de Baliol, was found her heir as to the whole ma- 
nor of Aketon and the other moiety of Burgh upon Sands, Kirkofwald and 
Layfingby, all which Euftace de Baliol (having had iffue by her which lived 
for fome time) held of her inheritance as tenant by the curtefy of England 
till his death, which happened in the 2 Ed. 1. at which time this Thomas had 
livery, and died in the 21 Ed. 1. 

Thomas de Multon, fon and heir of the laft Thomas, was 26 years of age at 
his father's death, and doing his homage in the fame year had livery, and died 
in the 23 Ed. 1. being then feifed of the manor of Denham in the county of 
Norfolk, as alfo of the manor of Burgh upon Sands and Kirkofwald, alfo of 
the barony of Gilfland, and divers lands in Santon, Irton, Bolton, and Gof- 
ford ; leaving Thomas his fon and heir 13 years of age, and Ifabel his wife fur- 
viving, who had for her dowry an affignation of the manor of Denham. 

"Which faid laft Thomas de Multon, paying 100/ for his relief, was in the 
31 Ed. i. in the Scots wars-, fo likewife in the 34 Ed. 1. â€” And in the 1 Ed. 2. 
he received command to fit himfelf with horfe and arms (together with John 
de Lancafter and Ingelram de Gyfnes) for refilling the incurfions of Robert 
de Brus of Scotland and his accomplices. In the 3 Ed. 1. he was again in. 
thofe wars of Scotland 5 fo likewife in the 4 Ed. 2. And in the 10 Ed. 2. he 
obtained for himfelf and Margaret his wife a fpecial charter from the king for 
a market on the Wednefday every week, and two fairs yearly, one on the eve, 
day, and morrow after the feftival of our lady, the other on the eve, day, and 
morrow after thefeaft of Simon and Jude at Ayfhall in the county of Somerfet; 
as alfo free warren in all his demefne lands at Seven Hampton in the faid county 
of Somerfet, and Fynho in the county of Devon. Moreover he was fum- 
moned to parliament amongft the barons of this realm from the 25 Ed. 1. till 
the 7 Ed. 2. inclufive ; and died foon after, leaving iffue Margaret married to 
Ranulph de Dacre, which Ranulph performing his fealty to king Edward the 
' fecond, fhe the faid Margaret then making proof of her age had livery of her 

lands. But this Thomas de Multon had a brother called William, who being his 
heir male held the manor of Layfingby in the county of Cumberland during 
his life; which William died in the 15 Ed. 3. leaving the faid Margaret then 
wife of Ranulph de Dacre his next heir 36 years of age. 

And thus this great inheritance was transferred by a female heir to the Dacres 
of Dacre-caftle in Cumberland â€¢, which family received further a large addition 
of fortune by marriage of the heirefs of Grayftock. The eldeft branch of 
Dacre enJed in a daughter, to whom the original eftate at Dacre (with fome 
others) did defcend : The reft, â€¢viz. Grayftock, Gilfland, Burgh, and others, 
were fettled upon a younger branch of the Dacres of the male line, which con- 
tinued in that name for four defcents further, and then that branch ended in 
coheirs; for George lord Dacre, in the nth year of queen Elizabeth, dying 
without iffue, was fucceeded by his three fitters ; one of whom dying unmar-

ried, the eftate came to the other two fitters, Anne the elder married to Philip 
earl of Arundel, and Elizabeth the younger married to the lord William Howard; 
both of them fons of 'Thomas duke of Norfolk. The barony of Burgh, in the 
partition, was allotted to the lady Anne, whofe defcendent in the fourth gene- 
ration, Henry Howard duke of Norfolk, fold the fame about the year 1689 to 
Sir John Lowther of Lowther, anceftor of the prefent owner Sir James Low i her 
baronet. 

The cuftoms of the manor of Burgh were afcertained by agreement between 
the lord and tenants, and confirmed by a decree in chancery about the year 
1674; whereby the tenants fubjected themfelves to pay a twenty-penny fine 
or two years improved value, at the option of the lord, upon every general 
fine or change of tenant by death ; and a thirty-penny fine or three years im- 
proved value, upon every change of tenant by fale or alienation, at the like 
option. 

In the year 1685, Henry Howard duke of Norfolk erected a monument on 
Burgh marfh, in memory of king Edward the firft, who died there, with this

The church of Burgh is dedicated to St. Michael. It was given by Sir 
Hugh de Morvil to the abbey of Holm Cultram, for the finding of lights, 
wine, and other necefiaries for the ornament of the church of Holm Cultram,

The faid vicarage was certified to the commiffioners of queen Anne's bounty 
at 13/ 8 s od. It was augmented in 1756 by the governors of the faid bounty 
jointly with Mr. Jofeph Liddel merchant in Newcaftle upon Tyne, with the 
fum of 400/, which was laid out in lands in the parifh of Kirklinton, of the 
prefent yearly value of about 16/. 

In 158 1, after the diffolution of the monafteries, inftitution was given by 
bifhop Meye to Sir William Blane clerk, on a prefentation by two yeomen of 
the neighbourhood, proving their title from the grantees of the abbot and con- 
vent before the diffolution. 

In 168 i, Thomas Story was prefented by king Charles the fecond. 
And on Thomas Story's death in 1739, Thomas I/may was inftituted on a 
prefentation under the great feal. 

In 1747, there were in this parifh 191 families; of which, 28 diffenters, all 
Quakers. 

The retlory of this church, belonging to the monaftery of Holm Cultram 
as aforefaid, was after the diffolution of that religious houfe granted by king 
James the firft in the 6th year of his reign unto Henry Fanfhaw knight, John 
Ofburn, and Francis Gorton, to be holden of the king as of the manor of Eaft 
Greenwich, by fealty only, in free and common focage and not in cafite ; un- 
der the yearly rent of ijl 12s od: Saying only to the king, his heirs and 
fucceffors, the donation and advowfon of the vicarage. Thefe grantees, in the 
year following fold the premiffes unto John Dyx alias Ramfay and Owen Shep- 
herd efquires. And they again in the year 161 2, for the fum of 660/, fold 
the fame to Henry Curwen and Michael Hodgfon in truft for themf elves and 
their fellow partners (then leffces and farmers of the faid rectory), whofe heira 
and afilgns are ftill the impropriators, 

Mr. Richard Hodgfon late of Weflend left 100/, the intereft thereof to be

The very name of Burgh (which was the Axelodunum of the Romans) leads 
one to look for a ftation here. And this appears to have been a little eaftward 
from the church, near what is called the Old Cattle, where there are manifeft 
remains of its ramparts. On the weft fide of the ftation thefe remains are 
mod diftincl, being about fix chains in length. And Severus's wall feems to 
have formed the north rampart of the ftation. Stones have been often plowed 
up here, and lime with the ftones. Urns have alfo frequently been dug up 
here. Mr. Hartley fays, he faw, befides an imperfect infcription, two Roman 
altars lying at a door in the town, but neither fculptures nor infcriptions 
vifible upon them-f-. But the late Dr. Lyttelton bifhop of Carlifle found upon 
an altar dug up in the vicar's garden here, the following infcription, 

DEO 
BELA 
TVCA 

The latter word certainly {lands for Belatucadro, and he fays it is the fifth 
infcription which has been difcovered in Britain, addrefied to this local 
deity*. About a quarter of a mile weft from the town there feems to have 
been a cajlellum, for at this place thefe hath been dug up a larger quantity of 
ftones, than the bare thicknefs of the wall could well have afforded. They 
call the field the Watch- hill, and a remarkable tree in it is called the Watch- 
tree, and the tradition runs that upon this fpot there was anciently a watch- 
towerj. 

PARISH OF ROCLIFFE. 

Rocliffe, the next pariih in this ward, lies on the north fide of the river 
Eden, abuts on Cargoe on the eaft, on Levington on the north, and is bound- 
ed by the river Eden on the fouth and weft. 

This manor was anciently the inheritance of Radulph de Bray, who gave the 
fame to William fon of John de Rocliffe in the fixth year of king John. And 
in the fifth year of king John, one Adam de Bray gave the rectory to John 
prior of St. Mary's in Carlifie, who did appropriate the fame to their church 
of Carlifle. In the 33 Hen. 3. William de Hardrigill and Maud his wife (who 
feems to have been a daughter of the Brays) granted the manor to John Lad- 
brook and Joan his wife, to be holden of the faid William and Maud and their 
heirs under the yearly rent of 5I. In the fame year John Francis redeemed it 
of the faid John Ladbrook and Joan. The land was then holden as a fee of 
Burgh, under the yearly payment of 2 s or one fparhawk. In the 54 Hen. 3. 
Gilbert brands held the fame by the fame.fervices, and died in the 6 Ed. 1. 
and his Ion Richard Francis being then under age, Michael de Harcla took him 
and married him to his daughter; wherefore the. king feized Michaei's lands, 
and fined him. The laid king, in the 2 2d year of his reign, gave the manor

of Rocliffe to Richard Gernon for life, and to remain after him to Richard his 
fon and to his wife Eleanor daughter of Gyles Fyennes, and the heirs of their 
two bodies, which manor the king had of Richard Gernon the father's gift. 
In the 23 Ed. 3. Thomos Daniel died feifed of Rocliffe, whofe daughter and 
heir Margaret was married to John Radcliffe and intailed all her inheritance 
upon the RadclifFs and their heirs male, whofe pofterity finally fold the fame 
to the Dacres, whereby this manor of Rocliffe became united to the barony of 
Burgh. But the demefne lands and the caftle were fold by Henry Howard 
duke of Norfolk in the year 1682 to Charles Ufher clerk, for the fum of 
15,000/; whofe grandfon lawyer Ufher left the fame to Hannah his fifter, who 
devifed the fame to Mr. Strong a kinfman of the family, who now (1770) en- 
joys the fame and lives at Peterborough. 

The retlory being given to the church of Carlifle as aforefaid, and totally 
appropriated thereto, was granted by king Hen. 8. to the dean and chapter 
there, who nominate a perpetual curate, and oblige their leffee of the rectory 
to pay him 20/ a year. There is neither houfe nor glebe belonging to the 
curate. In the year 1753 an allotment of 200/ of Queen Anne's bounty 
fell to this church, which ftill remains in the hands of the governors 
undifpofed of. 

About the year 1234, an award was made by Walter bifhop of Carlifle, 
between the prior and convent of Carlifle, and the abbot and convent of 
Holm Cultram, concerning their refpeclive tithes of fifh caught in Eden ; 
whereby the prior and convent were to have the tithes of fuch as were landed 
within the parifh of Rocliffe as re&ors of the faid parifh, paying to the abbot 
and convent 2s yearly for ever-f. 

In 1745, John Grearfon lelTee of the corn tithes of Ricardby bequeathed 
16s yearly to be paid out of the fame, to the churchwardens and overfeers of 
the poor of this parifh, to purchafe fix penny loaves to be given to fix poor 
perfons weekly on Sunday after divine fervice in the forenoon. 

In 1730, there were in this parifh 122 families ; of which, Quakers 4,. 
Prefbyterians, 4. 

PARISH OF BEAUMONT. 

Beaumont is the next parifh in this ward, but on the fouth fide of the 
river Eden. The town ftands upon a fair hill, from whence lieth every way 
a good profpect, which gave occafion to the name. It was anciently a manor 
belonging to the Bruns lords of Bownefs, who were alfo patrons of the church; 
but before the year 1380 it was come into the hands of the Dawes lords of

the barony of Burgh, and from thence forward went along with the faid 
barony, and therefore nothing further need to be faid concerning it in 
this place. 

The church is dedicated to St. Mary, valued in the king's books at 8/ is 
2d. The clear yearly value, as certified to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty, 18/ n 6 d. In 1772, it received an augmentation of 200/ from the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty, in conjunction with 200/ given by the 
countefs dowager Gower ; wherewith lands were purchafed in the parim of 
Sedbergh, of the prefent yearly value of 14/. About the year 1692, this 
Imall rectory was prefented to jointly with Kirk Andrews upon Eden, and 
hath ever fince been fo held. And Kirk Andrews having had an augmenta- 
tion by lot, the income of the two together may be about tot per annum. 

In 1747, it was certified that in this parifh there were 34 families; of 
which, one quaker, and one prefbyterian. [Note, the prefbyterian families 
in this and all other like places in the borders, are chiefly farmers that come 
out of Scotland ; who refort, as to their place of worfhip, to a prefbyterian 
meeting-houfe at Carlifle, or elfe go over on Sundays into their native country 
of Scotland.] 

Here is a fmall church at Beaumont, which ferves both this parilh and 
Kirk Andrews â€¢, for there is no church at Kirk Andrews. But the rector 
lives at Kirk Andrews, where there is an houle and a fmall glebe, and none at 
Beaumont ; which houfe was built by the prefent rector the reverend George 
Bownefs, for which ufe the bifhop permitted him to take the Hones that were 
the ruins of the old church there. 

About the year 1680, when the commons in Burgh barony were allotted, 
divided, and inclofed by agreement with the lord of the manor, a portion of 
land called Prieit-hill, containing about 30 acres, was afligned to Mr. Wilfon 
(then rector, and to his heirs for ten years after his death, in confederation 
of the prefent charge it was like to bring upon him. The faid Mr. Wilfon, 
when he died, was indebted 20/ to Mr. Reed, who entered upon the pre- 
mifTes for his fecurity. Afterwards Mr. George Hume, Mr. Wilfon's imme- 
diate fuccefibr, gave bond for the faid 20/, and had thereupon pofTeflion of 
the faid Prieft-hill. And Mr. Hume's widow keeping pofleflion of the land as 
her hufband's inheritance, it hath never yet been recovered back to the 
church. 

In the year 1296, Robert de la Feritate [the fame that at Bownefs is called 
Robert le Brun] prefented Sir Elias de Thirlwall, chaplain, to the vacant 
rectory of Beaumont; and dates his prefentation a-pud Bellum Mont em. 

In 1306, Walter de Arthuret was prefented by Sir Richard le Brun knight, 
who is alfo in the regifter faid to have prefented Adam the laft incumbent 
lately dead. 

In 1339, on the death of William Brcune late rector of Beaumont, Matilda 
Brune lady of Beaumont, prefents Richard Broune to the rectory. 

In 1365, Thomas de Sourly was rector of Beaumont; who in that year 

made

In 1366, on the death of Adam de Caldbeck rector of Beaumont, Walter de 
Ormejheved was prefented by William Beauchamp rector of Kirk Ofwald, 
Thomas de Tughale vicar of Torpenhow, and Robert Paye chaplain [truftees, 
as it feemeth, upon a fettlementj. 

In 1380, on the death of Walter de Ormefheved, Sir Hugh de Dacre lord 
of Gillfland prefents Robert Croft, who was inflituted by William rector of 
Bownefs the bifhop's vicar general. 

In 1490, Robert Chapman rector of Beaumont was witnefs to an indenture 
of Thomas lord Dacre. 

In 1562, on the deprivation of John Thompfon for obftinately refuting the 
oath of fupremacy, Henry Hajelhead was instituted on the prefentation of Sir 
William Dacre knight, lord Dacre of Grayftock and Gillfland. 

In 158 1, on the death of the faid Henry Hafelhead, inftitution was given 
to Sir Lancelot Wilfon clerk, prefented by Philip earl of Arundel. 

In 1 6 1 1 , on the refignation of Edward Johnfton, Thomas Thompfon was infli- 
tuted on the prefentation of Anne countefs dowager of Arundel. 

In 1 6 15, Sir John Wilfon was prefented by the faid countefs dowager. 

And in 1616, Thomas Robinfon was inflituted on the fame title. 

In 1625, on the death of Thomas Robinfon, a citizen of London (patron 
for that turn) prefents Thomas Warwick, who was inflituted thereupon. 

In 1634, Andrew Smith was prefented by Thomas earl of Arundel and 
Surry, earl marfhal of England. 

In 1663, on Andrew Smith's death, Patricius Hume was prefented by the 
countefs of Arundel and Surry. 

In 1692, on the death of Richard Wilfon rector of Beaumont, George Hume 
was prefented by Sir John Lowther baronet. 

In 1703, Gabriel Tr ant was inflituted both to this rectory and to that of 
Kirk Andrews upon Eden, vacant by the death of George Hume, on the 
prefentation of Richard vifcount Lonfdale. 

In 1 705, on Mr. Trant's death, Thomas Lewthwaite was prefented by the 
iame patron. 

In 1762, on the death of Thomas Lewthwaite, George Bownefs clerk was 
inflituted to this rectory and that of Kirk Andrews upon Eden jointly, upon 
the prefentation of Sir James Lowther baronet. 

PARISH OF KIRK ANDREWS UPON EDEN. 

The parifh of Kirk Andrews upon Eden is parcel of the barony of 
Burgh, and there is nothing in the civil ftate thereof to diftinguifh it from the 
reft of that barony. 

The church of this place, as the name imports, was dedicated to St. 

Andrew, though there is now no church remaining. The parilhioners have long 

Vol. II. G g attended 



226 CUMBERLAND WARD. (Kirk Andrews upon Eden.) 

attended divine fervice at Beaumont, but they Hill continue to bury in the 
churchyard here. There are only about 26 families in this whole parifh. 

In pope Nicholas's Valor in the year 1291 this church is not rated, becaufe 
it did not exceed four marks, and the rector had no other benefice. Alio in 
Edward the fecond's Valor it is not rated. In Henry the eighth's taxation 
it is rated at 3/ 1 1 s sidf. It was certified to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty at gl gs 8d, and having fince had an augmentation by lot, it may now 
be worth (together with Beaumont, as is aforefaid) about 60/ a year. 

In the year 1361, on the refignation of Sir John Palmer rector of this 
church, the priorefs and convent of Marrig or Maryke in the county of York 
prefent Sir John de Bempton, who was thereupon inftituted by bifhop Welton. 
And the former of thefe rectors had a certificate from the bifhop of his volun- 
tary refignation and fair demeanor in the diocefe of Carlifie, and the latter a 
difpenfation for one year's abfence. â€” And this is all that occurs in the bifhops 
regifters concerning this church before the reformation. 

In 1576, on the death of Thomas Watfon rector of Kirkanders, Chrijlopher 
Lowther was inftituted on a prefentation by queen Elizabeth. 

In 1587, on Chriftopher Lowther's death, bifhop Meye collates William 
Witton by lapfe. 

In 161 1, on William Witton's death,. George Millikin was prefented by one 
George Rumney. 

In 1692, on the death of Richard fVilfon rector of Kirk Andrews and of 
Beaumont^ George Hume was inftituted to the faid rectories on a prefentation 
by Sir John Lowther baronet. 

And fince that time both the faid rectories jointly have been prefented to 
by the houfe of Lowther. 

PARISH OF GRINSDALE. 

Grinsdale, Green/dale, lies next j. being a parifh, town, and manor, within 
Burgh barony, and holden of the fame. It gave furname to a family of 
gentlemen, the eldeft of whom that Mr. Denton had met with was Odard de 
Grinfdale, and after him AJketill fon of Robert de Grin/dale. They lived in the 
time of Henry the firft, Stephen, and Henry the fecond. The eldeft line 
failed about king John's time, when the inheritance fell to two daughters, 
whereof one was married to the lord Newton in Allerdale, and Thomas de 
Newton held by that right a moiety of Grinfdale of Thomas Multon lord of 
Burgh in Henry the third's time. And the other moiety was then fo holden 
by one William de la Sore, whofe anceftor had married the other coparcener. 

A fecond brother of AJketill, named Robert, was a citizen of Carlifie, and 
became an inheritor of lands at Grinfdale and in Farton, which defcended to 
Gilbert fon of Robert, which Gilbert had a fon Robert de Grinfdale who in the 
23 Ed. 1. and again in the 33 Ed. 1. repreiented the city of Carlifie in parlia-

ment. The faid Robert had a fon Alan de Grin/dale, who was burgefs for the 
faid city in the 33 and 34 Ed. 1. and one of the reprefentatives for the county 
in the 6 Ed. 2. After him was Robert de Grin/dale, who reprefented the faid 
city feveral times in the reigns of Ed. 2. and Ed. 3. The laft of the name 
was Henry de Grin/dale, who had two daughters coheirs, Marriott and Margaret^ 
whofe heirs fold their inheritance to the Dentons of Cardew in Henry the 
fourth's time, the lad of which name was George Denton efquire, who fold his 
eftate to Sir John Lowtber about the year 1686. 

Newton's moiety of Grinfdale fell by marriage to Martindale ; the laft of 
which name, James Martindale, had 5 da\ighters coheirs : two of which 
daughters were married to Richard Dacre and Humphrey Dacre, who joining 
with their kinfman Leonard Dacre in his rebellion in the reign of queen Eli- 
zabeth, were attainted, and their eftate here feized by the crown ; which was 
afterwards granted to Whitmore efquire, and by him or his reprefentative 
to Jofeph Dacre of Kirklinton efquire, in whole name and family it ftill 
continues. 

The Studholmes alfo had a portion here, which they purchafed of the lord 
of Kirk Andrews, fon and heir of John de Parton and Kirk Andrews about 
the year 1336, and continued in that family for 10 or 12 defcents, and after 
that was fold out into feveral freeholds. 

The church of Grinfdale is dedicated to St. Mungo or Kentigern. It was 
given by Hugh de Morvil the firft of that name lord of Burgh, and Euftachia 
his wife, to the prior and convent of Lanercoft, who fhortly after got it 
totally appropriated to that houfe, and fupplied the fame with one of their 
own members, without any endowment of a vicarage. It is not mentioned in 
king Henry the eighth's valuation, nor is there any prefentation or other ac- 
count of it in the bifhops regifters. 

After the diflolution of the monafteries, king Edward the fixth by letters 
patent bearing date June 6, in the fixth year of his reign, granted to Sir 
Thomas Dacre fenior knight (amongft other pofTeflions of the priory of Laner- 
coft) the whole re&ory of Greenfdale, with the advowfon of the church there. 
And his dependents have ever fince enjoyed the fame, and nominated a curate, 
with a ftipend of 40 s a year. At which fum it was certified to the governors 
of queen Anne's bounty ; and having been augmented by lot with 200/ in 
1737, and again in 1757, and again in 1 77 1, the whole revenue now amounts 
to about 30/ a year. 

The church for many years laid totally in ruins, until Jofeph Dacre efquire 
the impropriator about the year 1743 rebuilt it at his own expence. 

In 1747 it was certified, that there were in this parifh 22 families j of 
which, 1 Quaker, and 1 Prefbyterian.

CARLISLE. 

We come next to the ancient and famous city of Carlisle, called by the 
Romans Luguvallium^ ftanding in the north weft corner of the foreft of Engle- 
wood, environed with the rivers of Eden on the north eaft fide, Petterel on 
the fouth eaft, and Caldew on the fouth weft. It is fituate along Severus's 
wall, and from the colony there placed received its denomination. For Liu 
gyda gwal, in the ancient Britifh, fignifies an army by the wall ; from whence 
the Romans framed their Luguvallium. The Saxons afterwards, by contrac- 
tion, called it Luell and Lu wall-, and the laft Britifh inhabitants there, pre- 
fixing to it the word caer, which is the general appellation of a city, called it 
Caer Luell, or Caer Leyll ; and the common people pronounce it according to 
the faid orthography to this day. 

Upon the recefs of the Romans, this place was utterly ruinated by the in- 
curfions of the Caledonians, and other barbarous northern nations ; until 
Egfrid king of Northumberland, in the 7th century, rebuilt it and encom- 
paffed it wich a wall of ftone â€¢, and placing here a college of fecular priefts, 
gave it to the famous St. Cuthbert, bifhop of Lindisfarne (from whence the 
fee was afterwards transferred to Durham), in thefe words : " I have likewife 
" beftowed upon him the city called Luguballia, with the lands fifteen miles- 
" about it." The citizens (fays Bede) carried Cuthbert to fee the walls of the 
city, and a well of admirable workmanfhip built in it by the Romans. 

On the coming in of William the conqueror, in the year 1066, he ifiued 
out his writ to the inhabitants of Carlifle and Cumberland, commanding them 
to be fubject to the bifhop of Durham as their diocefan, from whofe prede- 
cefiors they had received Chriftianity-f-. And in the year 1082, in a charter 
of William de Karilepho bifhop of Durham reckoning up the contents of his 
diocefs, and in feveral other following inftruments to that purpofe, Carlifle 
with all the circumjacent country is mentioned as part of the diocefs of 
Durham |. 

But the city at that time having been molt grievoufly Shattered by the Danes, 
had lain buried in its ruins for near 200 years, until it began to flourifh again 
by the favour and affiftance of William Rufus, who built it and added a new 
wall with a caftle, and placed a garrifon in it, firft of Flemings, whom upon 
better confideration he quickly removed into North Wales and the Ifle of An- 
glefey â€¢, and then of fouthern Englifh, who, as the Saxon Chronicle intimates, 
were to cultivate thofe parts. To this colony it is that all the records afcribe 
the firft tillage that was known thereabouts. It is certain the whole foreft of 
Englewood lay uncultivated for many years after. At that time (as Malmef- 
bury has it) was to be feen a Roman triclinium or dining room of ftone, arched 
over, which neither the violence of weather, nor fire could deftroy. On the 
front of it was this infeription Marii Viclori<e -, fome will have this Marius to

be Arviragus the Briton ; others, the Marius who was falured emperor in 
oppofition to Gallienus. Yet it is faid that fome copies have it, not Marii 
Viftoria, but Marti Viftori ; which latter may probably be favoured by fome, 
as feeming to come nearer the truth. 

Leland fays, that the wall is near a mile in compafs ; that it is right fair 
and ftrong, and built of redifh fquare ftones : That in it there are three 
gates, Bocher, Caldew, and Richard gate â€¢, otherwife known by the name 
of South, Weft, and North gates j and likewife called Englifh, Irilh, and 
Scotch gates -f . 

After the death of William Rufus, king Henry the firft, in the fecond year 
of his reign, founded here a college or priory of fecular priefts, and made 
Athelwold his confefior or chaplain (prior of St. Ofwald's at Noftell in York- 
fhire) the firft prior of Carlifle, dedicating the church to the honour of the 
blefied virgin Mary j but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his 
time, he could not perfect all things before the 33d year of his reign, and 
then by the counfel of the prior Athelwald he erected a bifhop's fee at Car- 
lille, and made the faid Athelwald firft bifhop there, whom the archbifhop of 
York (named Thurftan) did confecrate in that year. And in his ftead another 
chaplain of the faid king Henry, named Walter, was made the fecond prior 
of that houfe ; who a little before his election had taken upon him by the 
king's licence the habit of a regular canon there, which order of canons the 
king and bifhop Athelwold had placed in that houfe, banifhing the fecular 
priefts immediately upon his confecration. The faid Walter gave to the church 
of Carlifle in pure alms for ever his lands in Lynftock, Richardby, Crofby, 
Little Crofby, Walby, Brunfkewgh, Carleton, and the wood, and the 
churches and rectories of St. Cuthbert in Carlifle, and Stainwiggs, which the 
king had given him. And the fame gift was confirmed both by the king and 
bi(hop Athelwald J. 

This city, from its fituaticn as a frontier againft Scotland, hath been fubject 
to various viciffitudes. In the reign of king Henry the fecond a great part 
of it was burned by the Scots, in which fire their charters and other records 
perifhed. And king Henry the third having renewed their charter of privi- 
leges, his charter alfo perifhed by fire, as king Ed. 1. recites in his charter of 
renewal granted to them in the 21ft year of his reign : But this latter fire was 
not occafioned by the enemy, but accidental ; in which a great part of the 
city was laid in afhes ; which happened on Sunday within the octaves of 
Afcenfion day in that year. 

In the 32 Ed. 1. it appears from an entry in the regifter book of the abbey 
of St. Mary's York, that on the 4th of the Calends of June in the fame year, 
one half of this city was burned down, as far as the gate of Rickardby*. 

The 35th year of the faid king will be ever memorable in the annals of 
this city, for the parliament then held at Carlifle. The king having refided 
here and in the neighbouring parts for feveral years, being intent upon his ex- 
pedition into Scotland, fummoned a parliament to meet ac Carlifle on the 20th

of January in this year; which met accordingly, and continued till Palm 
Sunday following. And what great things they did in that time, in oppofing 
the papal extortions, furthering the expedition againft Scotland, concluding 
prince Edward's marriage with a daughter of France, and other public trans- 
actions, our hiftories abundantly inform us. The king continued at Carlifle 
till the 28th of June â€¢, and then fetting forward towards Scotland, he was feized 
with a flux, and died at Burgh upon Sands on the 7th of July following. 

In the 9 Ed. 2. Robert de Brus, king of Scotland, came with his whole 
force, and befieged Carlifle for ten days, laying wafte the whole country as far 
as Allerdale, Coupland, and Weftmorland. They made many attacks and 
erecttd feveral warlike engines, but at laft raifed the fiege in fo great an hurry, 
that they left all the faid engines behind them, and were followed by the 
Englifh, who took John de Moravia and Sir Robert Bardolf prifoners, and 
brought them to the caftle at Carlifle, for whom a large ratifom was paid. 

In the 15 Ed. 2. Andrew de Harcla, having vanquifhed the earl of Lan- 
caster, with his adherents the lords John de Moubray and Roger de Clifford, 
at Burrough-bridge in Yorkfhire, was for this his great fervice made earl of Car- 
lifle. In the next year, king Edward prepared a large army againft Scotland; 
which king Robert de Brus being informed of, he entered England near Car- 
lifle, and burnt Rofe and the country of Allerdale, and plundered the abbey 
of Holm Cultram (though his father was buried there), and proceeded 
through Copeland as far as Prefton, burning and deftroying all the way he 
went : And returning with great fpoil, he lay in the neigbourhood of Carlifle 
for five days, flill continuing the devaluation. Whereupon Andrew de Har- 
cla, concluding that king Edward neither knew how to govern nor defend his 
kingdom, and fearing that he would in the end lofe it, did on the third 
of January privately repair to king Robert at Lochmaben, and there they 
mutually agreed to afiift and fuccour each other with all their might. And it 
was further agreed, that if the king of England fhould within one year 
approve thereof, that then king Robert fhould caufe one monaftery to be 
built in Scotland and endowed with 500 marks of yearly revenue for ever, to 
pray for the fouls of all thofe that had perifhed in the wars between England 
and Scotland ; and fhould pay 4000 marks of filver to the king of England 
within ten years : and that the king of England fhould have the prince of 
Scotland and marry him to a reladon. The earl returning to Carlifle fummon- 
ed all the chief of the county, as well clergy as laity ; and there, more out of 
fear than love, they all fwore that they would keep and defend the faid con- 
vention with their whole power. And all the common people were much 
pleafed therewith, hoping they might now live peaceably at home. But an 
account of all thefe proceedings being carried to king Edward, he was greatly 
furprifed and troubled at it ; and publickly proclaiming the earl a traytor, 
fent to Anthony lord Lucy to apprehend him, promifing that he and his 
affiftants fhould be well rewarded. Whereupon the lord Lucy, having his 
fquires and other men properly difperfed here and there upon various pretend- 
ed caufes, on the morrow of St. Matthias the apoftle, he and they entered 
the caftle of Carlifle where the earl was, as upon common bufinefs. With 
3 lord 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 231 

lord Lucy were three flout and daring knights, Sir Hugh de Louther, Sir 
Richard de Denton, and Sir Hugh de Moriceby, with four lquires, all well 
armed. And as they entered the caftle, they carefully left a guard at every 
gate. Then lord Lucy with his three knights went through the great hall to 
the place where the earl was fitting, and thus accofted him â€¢, Sir, you muft 
either furrender or defend yourfelf inftantly. Upon which, he fubmitted. 
Then fome of his fervants calling out treafon, the keeper of the inner gate 
would have fhut it upon the knights that had entered, but Sir Richard Denton 
killed him with his own hand, and this was the only perfon that was (lain in 
the whole affair. But all that were in the caftle furrendred themfelves and it 
to the lord Lucy. But fome of the family repaired with all fpeed to High- 
head caftle, to acquaint his brother John therewith, who immediately fled into 
Scotland, and with him Sir William Blount and many others. A fpecial 
mefienger being difpatched to king Edward at York to acquaint him with all 
that was done and to know his pleafure, the earl in the mean time, appre- 
hending what would be the confequence, confeiTed himfelf to feveral monks, 
who gave him abfolution, and aff red him of eternal happinefs. On the feaft 
of St. Cedde, fix days after the feifing of the faid earl, an armed force with Sir 
Jeffrey de Scroop chief jufticiar arrived at Carlifle ; who the next day tried 
and fentenced the faid earl to be degraded, hanged, and quartered. After 
the pronouncing of which fentence, the earl faid, You have difpofed of my 
body at your pleafure, but my foul I give to God, And then with an un- 
changeable countenance, and uplifed hands and eyes he was carried to the 
gallows and executed, having firft fully explained the intention of the treaty. 

In the 11 Ed. 3. the Scots befieged the city of Carlifle, but being not 
able to take it,, they burned the hofpital of St. Nicholas, and all the places 
adjacent. 

In the 6 Ric. 2. the Scots made an inroad into the foreft of Englewood,. 
whence they drove home 40,000 head of cattle f, facked Penrith in the fair 
time, but attempted nothing againft Carlifle, being at that time too ftrongly 
guarded. 

In the civil wars between the two houfes of York and Lancafter, in the 
reigns of Hen. 4, 5, and 6, this city was miferably haraffed, the fuburbs 
burned, and all the adjacent parts deftroyed even to the gates of the city. In 
confideration whereof, and of their impoverishment thereby, king Edward 
the fourth remitted to them one half of their ancient fee farm rent of 80/. 

In the 29 Hen. 8. in the infurrection during Afke's rebellion, Nicholas 
Mufgrave, Thomas Tilby, and others, favourers of that caufe, befieged Car- 
lifle with 8000 men, but were repulfed by the city, and in their return 
encountered by the duke of Norfolk, who caufed all the captains (fave Muf- 
grave who efcaped) and about 70 other perfons by law martial to be hanged 
on Carlifle walls J. 

It is faid that king Henry the eighth built the citadel of Carlifle. How- 
ever, be that as it may, it is certain both that and the reft of the fortifications

being garrifoned only by an undifciplined new-raifed militia, who were not in 
number fufBcient to defend fo large an extent of wall; and the caftle likewife 
furrendred, being guarded only by the governor and about 70 or 80 invalids, 
and of thefe one half at leaft not fit for fervice. In their retreat into Scotland, 
the rebels left a fmall garrifon here, who after a few days fiege furrendered, 
on the 30th of December in that year, to William duke of Cumberland, on 
the fole condition of not being prefently put to the fword, but rtferved to his 
majefty's pleafure : Prifoners taken therein were; of the Manchefter regiment, 
colonel Townley, 5 captains, 6 lieutenants, 7 enfigns, 1 adjutant, and g% non-

This charter, comprehending all the reft, was furrendered Aug. 7, 1684, to 
the lord chief juftice Jeffreys, judge of aflize, for the ufe of his Majefty *. 
Which furrender being not inrolled, was therefore a void furrender ; and this 
charter, like as many others, was reftored and declared valid and effectual by 
proclamation of king James the fecond a little before his abdication, viz*. 
Oct. 17, 1688 f. 

This city fends two members to parliament, who are chofen by the free- 
men of the city, refident or non-refident â€¢, who are now about 700. 

On a difpute in the houfe of commons, Feb. 11, 171 J, it was declared, 
that the fons of burgefTes born after their father's freedom, and perfons ferving 
feven years apprenticeship within the city, have a right to be made free Â£. 

The assizes for the county are held at this city by a fpecial act of Parlia- 
ment, 14 Hen. 6. c. 3. which enacts as follows : " "Whereas by a ftatute made 
in the time of king Richard the fecond, it was ordained, that the juftices af- 
figned or to be affigned to take affizes and deliver gaols fhall hold their feffions

King Philip and queen Mary, by their charter bearing date 71I1 March in 
the 4th and 5th years of their reign, granted to the bifhop the advowfon and 
collation of all the four prebends. 

The fame queen, by the advice of cardinal Pole, intended to give the ad- 
vowfons that then remained in the crown which had belonged to the religious 
houfes, to the feveral bifhops within their refpective diocefes ; and accordingly 
there is a grant by Philip and Mary to the bifnop of Carlifle of the feveral ad- 
vowfons of Bampton, Crofby, and Overton in the county of Weflmorland, 
and Burgh, Kirkofwald, and Dacre in Cumberland ( together with divers others 
in Cumberland, which, by miftake, are fet forth to be in the diocefe of Carlifle, 
but are in reality in the diocefe of Chefter). But the queen feems to have died 
before this grant was carried into full execution. It bears dare 14 Nov. 5 and 
6 P. and M. and fhe died three days after, viz. on the 17th of the fame 
month. 

In this city there are two â– parijh churches. The firft and more ancient is that 
of St. Cuthbert, founded in honour of that holy man, who was made bifhop 
of Durham in 685 ; in whofe diocefe Carlifle then was. When the fteeple of 
this church was rebuilt in the time of queen Elizabeth, there was found a 
large parcel of fmall filver coins to the quantity of near a Winchefter bufliel, 
called St. Cuthbert's pence; fuch as that bifhop and fome of his fucccffors 
bifhops of Durham had a privilege to coin ; and which were fuppofed to have 
been oblations at the building. 

This parifh confifts of Botchardgate within the city â€¢, and without the city, 
of the feveral divifions of Botchardgate, Carleton, Brifco, Uprightby, Harraby, 
and Bleckhil). It confifts of 364 families: And hath received divers augment- 
ations from queen Anne's bounty both by lot and in conjun<5f.ion with the fub- 
fcriptions of the p^riflnoners and others, wherewith lands have been purchafed 
,in the neighbourhood, to the value of about 40/ a year, 

All the faid divifions without the city (except Bleckhill) are parts and par- 
cels of the manor of Botchardgate or Prior lordfhip (as it is called) belong- 
ing to the dean and chapter; only the houfe of Crofton have feveral tenants 
at Brifco and thereabouts, and during the time of the ufurpation they were 
lords of the whole, and the cuftoms were fettled during that period. 

Blackhill, at the time of the Norman conqueft, was barren ground, and fo 
received the name of Blackhill. King Hen. 1. gave it to Od:.rd de Logis, 
baron of Wigton and citizen of Carlifle; who held part of it in demefne, and 

granted

granted the reft in fervices. It defcended in his hTue male until the time of 
Ed. 3. when Margaret de Wigton fole daughter and heir of John de Wigton 
knight (laft iffue male of that houle) to defend her birthright was glad to give 
away this manor, together with Melmerby and Stainton, to Robert Parving 
then the king's ferjeant at law, againft Sir Richard Kirkbride the heir male. 
It continued in the Parvings for ibme few defcents, and then came to heirs fe- 
male ; by whom it was fold to William Stapleton and Matilda his wife, of 
whom the lord Dacre purchafed. 

Sir Richard Fienes, chamberlain to king. Ed. 4. having married Joan 
daughter and fole heir of Thomas lord Dacre of the north, and being accept- 
ed and declared lord Dacre of the fouth and baron of the realm in the 3 7 
Hen. 6. became proprietor not only of this manor, but likewife of Kirk 
Ofwald, Baron-wood, Dacre, Martindale foreft, and other places; all which 
were fold in the year 1716, for the fum of 15,000/, to Sir Chriftopher Muf- 
grave baronet father of Sir Philip Mufgrave the prelent owner, by the ladies 
Barbara and Anne daughters and coheirs of Thomas earl of Suflex fon of 
Francis lord Dacre. 

In the year 1698, Thomas earl of Suflex, in conflderation of 36 years 
ancient finable rent, granted to the tenants (48 in number) a difcharge from 
fines and dry multure, with the wood upon their tenements, but referving the 
.ancient renr, futt of court, moor farm and greenhue ; with liberty to alienate 
their tenements without licence of the lord, giving notice thereof within 40 
days â€¢, paying only a penny fine on death or alienation, and to the fteward for 
an alienation 4^, and for furrender and copy thereof 6d, and inrollment 4^, 
and 2d to the bailiff upon every defcent or alienation. â€” And about the fame 
time the common was divided and granted in fee to the tenants without any 
rent referved, the lord having 150 acres for his fhare in land, which is now 
called Blackhill park, and is the inheritance of Mrs. Wardale of Carlifle. 

The pari(h of St. Mary's confifts of the feveral divifions within the city 
of Scotchgate, Filhergite, Caftlegate, and Abbey gate ; and without the 
city, of the feveral divifions of Caldewgate, Cumberfdale, Richardo-ate, and 
Wreay â€¢, and contains in the whole about 193 families. 

Scotchgate divifion is within that which is called the manor of the focap-e 
of Carlifle ;. which manor, by virtue of a commiflipn under the feal of the 
exchequer, bearing date Nov. 21, 16 10, and directed to the commiffioners Sir 
Wilham Hutton and Sir Chriftopher Pickering knights, Aaron Rathborne 
and Lancelot Skelton efquires, Andrew Oglethorpe and Henry Baines aentle- 
men, was defenbed and certified as follows : " Beginning on the fouth fide of 
the river Eden over againft Etterby, and there leaving the fame river it

acres of land, where it leaveth the river and inclofeth the fame parcel of land 
on the weft fide thereof on the river fide againft the fouth weft corner of 
Walk miln doles ; and fo eroding over the river, and leaving the fame, it 
extendeth fouthwards towards Curreck by the weft fide of the fields of 
Blacall, Curreck, and Uprightby â€¢, and fo about the fame fields to a crofs 
way at the weft end of Uprightby town ; and fo fouthwards by the highway 
to Cruny beck which falleth into the river of Pettrell ; and there leaving the 
fame way, it extendeth down the fame beck to Pettrell ; and from it turneth 
northwards down the fame river to the fouth eaft corner of Paradife, where 
crofting the river and leaving it, it goeth down a fmall miln water on the 
fouth fide of Paradife, and inclofeth the fame at Gallows bridge ; from whence 
crofting over the highway, it inclofeth part of the Spittle Crook lying on the 
fouth-eaft fide of Pettrell â€¢, and fo extendeth ftill down Pettrell to the foot 
thereof, where the fame falleth into Eden â€¢, from thence up, over the faid 
river of Eden, to the foot of a beck falling thereinto againft Kinnyholme, 
and fo up the fame beck on the weft fide of Richardby to the north-eaft corner 
of Stanwix grounds ; then leaving the fame beck, it extendeth northweft- 
wards to the highway leading from Carlifte to Tirraby -, and fo crofting over 
the fame way, it paffeth on the north fide of Horfemanfield to the north-welt 
corner thereof, and from thence extendeth fouthwards to a highway dividing 
Horfemanfield and the weft part of Stanwix ; and fo crofting the fame way, it 
extendeth on the weft fide of Stanwix to the river of Eden, and from thence 
down the fame river to Etterby where it firft began." 

The body of St. Mary's church, which is the cathedral, was before the 
civil wars in 1641 a fpacious building, comprehending all the weftern part of 
the church from the great tower, and extending in length 135 feet. But this 
being deemed fuperfluous by the fanatical reformeis, was in a great meafure 
demolsfhed, as the cloifters and chapter houfe were afterwards, and the ma- 
terials applied to build a guard houfe at every gate, erecting two bateries in 
the caftle, and a main guard-houfe in the market place. 

The eaftern part of the cathedral or quire is faid to have been built by con- 
tributions in the reign of king Edward the third. And there are about that 
time in the bifhop's regifters many letters patent or orders granted by the 
bifhops, recommending to the clergy of the feveral parifhes fuch proctors as 
the chapter thought fit to appoint from time to time, with a command to 
publifh an indulgence of forty days penance to fuch of the laity as fhould 
generoufly contribute towards the charge of the faid building. The door with 
the work about it near the bifhop's throne was the work of prior Haythwaite 
about the year 1480, his name having been on the backfide of it. And the 
oppofite door with the workmanmip about it feems to have been erected by 
prior Senhoufe about the year 1500, his known adage having been upon ic of 
^itinera qunque Dei, Jint medicina met. The whole dimenfions of this fabrick, 
before part of it was deftroyed as aforefaid, were as follows : The quire, on 
the eaft of the crofs ifle, in length 137 feet; the crofs ifle 2& feet ; on the 
weft of the crofs ifle 43 feet-, which when the intire weftern part was Handing, 
before the civil wars when 92 feet were deftroyed, made the whole fabrick 300

feet in length. The breadth of the choir and ides is 71 {eet t and of the 
great north ifle from north to fouth 124 feet. The height of the choir to the 
center of the ceiling is 75 feet, and of the tower 127 feet, which had a fpire 
of lead upon it of 13 or 14 feet, before the fame was taken down to the 
fquare tower foon after the reftoration, it having for want of care in the pre- 
ceding times of confufion become ruinous. The weftern part is a Norman- 
nic Saxon ftructure. But the choir is a noble and exact piece of Gothic 
architecture. , It has a {lately eaft window of 48 feet in height, and 30 in 
breadth, and'is adorned with pillars of mod curious workmanfhip. The roof 
was elegantly vaulted with wood, and embellifhed with the coats of arms of 
all the founders and contributors. But this failing by length of time, toge- 
ther with the lead roof, the dean and chapter forne few years ago new laid the 
roof ; and the ceiling being totally ruined and deftroyed, they in the year 1764 
contracted for a ftucco groined ceiling, and for cleaning and whitening the 
whole church. And rinding the new lead much torn and broken by wind, 
for want of a ceiling underneath, the upper tire of that was done again, and 
a coping added to the rigging. And thus proceeding from one repair to 
another, the whole expence hath amounted to upwards of 1300/; towards 
which, dean Bolton contributed 50/, bilhop Lyttelton 100/, and the countefs 
dowager Gower 200/. The reft was made up by the dean and chapter fiom 
fales of wood and from their own revenues. 

"Within this church of St. Mary's, was a chapel dedicated to St. Catherine* 
founded by John de Capella citizen of Carlifle, and endowed by him with 
certain rents, lands, and burgage houfes ; fome of which being detained and 
concealed, bifhop Appleby in the year 1366 required the chaplains of St. 
Mary's and St. Cuthbert's to give public notice that refdtution be made within 
ten days, and at the end of the faid ten days to excommunicate with bell, 
book, and candle all fuch unjuft detainers. â€” In this chapel bifhop Barrow was. 
buried, which was at the fouth fide of the cathedral. 

Bifhop Whelpdale, who died in 1423, gave by his will 200/, for founding 
and endowing a chantry in this cathedral for praying for the fouls of Sir Tho- 
mas Skelton knight and Mr. John Glafton both of this diocefe. â€” This perhaps 
might be what was called the chantry of St. Roch* endowed with feveral bur- 
gage houfes in the city of Carlifle. 

Within this city of Carlifle was alfo a free chapel dedicated to St. Alban ; 
concerning which there is an entry in bifhop Welton's regifter in the year 
1356, that the bifhop being informed that divine fervice was frequently had in 
the chapel of St. Alban's, and the dead buried in the yard of the faid chapel, 
he therefore iffues a commiffion to the prior of St. Mary's and others, to 
inquire by men of credit as well clerks as laymen, whether both or either of 
thefe had ever been confecrated. And it appearing that they were not, the 
chaplains of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's are commanded to give public 
notice that none hereafter preiume to read or hear divine fervice in the laid

by letters patent bearing date the 30th of January in the 3d year of his reign,, 
grants to Thomas Dalfton efquire and William Denton gentleman^ the chantry, 
of St. Alban in the city of Carlifie, and all thofe mefluages, tenements, 
burgage houfes, buildings, (hops, curtilages, and hereditaments whatfoever,, 
with the appurtenances, in the tenure of John Thompfon, Robert Monk.eâ€ž 
Robert Patten, Robert Pattenfon, Anthony Rumpnay, Henry- Mawfon, John 
Slayter, John Dunken, Cuthbert Pattenfon, Elizabeth Young, John Cardall, 
Elizabeth Barnefadere, Alice Stephenfon, and Nicholas Studdard, in the city, 
of Carlifie, to the faid chantry of St. Alban belonging. 

There was alfo a chantry of St. Crofs \ as appears by a grant of king Ed. 6. 
bearing date March 28, in the third year of his reign, whereby (amongft other 
particulars) he grants to Henry Tanner and Thomas Bucher, their heirs, and": 
affigns, the chantry, of SL Crofs. in the cathedral church of Carlifie, with all 
meituages, lands, tenements, profits, and hereditaments whatfoever, in the 
city of Carlifie and in Kirklinton to the faid chantry belonging. 

Without the gates of the city, was the hofpital of St. Nicholas: which was 
of royal foundation (but by which of the kings we have not found) for thir- 
teen lepers, men and women. 

In the time of bifhop Bernard, about the year 11 80, a moiety of the tithes* 
of Little Bampton was given to this hofpital by Adam fon of Robert, on. 
condition to have always two almfmen from the parifh of Bampton. 

In the year 1336, Thomas de Goldyngton, then mafter of the hofpital^ 
brought a prohibition againft the bifhop who was about to vifit this houfe, on- 
a fuggeftion. that it was a royal foundation, and therefore only vifitable by the 
king's chancellor or commiffioners : And in 1341, the faid bifhop, with 
Robert Eglesfeld re&or of Burgh and others, was commiffioned by the king 
<o vifit this hofpital. 

In 1371, on complaint trade by the mafter, brethren, and fitters of. the 
hofpita! of St. Nicholas, that the houfe was defrauded of a great part of their 
/aeceflary fuftenance, the bifhop iflues out a monition to all rectors and vicar* 
in the neighbouring parts, requiring them to give notice to their parifhioners, 
that all fuch detainers of threaves of corn or other goods belonging to the 
faid hofpital, f&all make full payment or reftitution within the fpaee of ten 
days, on pain of the greater excommunication. 

I,n the year 1477, l 7 ^d. 4. this hofpital and the revenues thereof were 
given to the prior and convent of St. Mary's Carlifie, which priory was af- 
terwards given to the dean and chapter. The fite of the hofpital is now 
holden of the dean and- chapter by Mr. John Stordy on a leafe for 21 years ; 
and Mr. John Lyddel, on a like leafe, holds the moiety of the tithes of Little 
Bampton. 

The chapel of Wtea\ in the parifh of St. Cuthbert, is as ancient, at leafh, 
as the reign of king Edward tha fec-ond ; for in the year 1319. bifhop Halton 

allowed

allowed a chaplain to ir, to attend divine offices, on condition that he con- 
(tantly refided upon the place. The chapelry confifts of the villages of IVrea 
of 20 families, and Newkiggin (a grange belonging to the dean and chapter) 
of 6 or 7 families, with fome other fcattered houfes. The late Dr. Bolton 
dean of Carlifle, having procured fome money for augmentations, gave 200/ 
to this chapel, and the governors of queen Anne's bounty gave other 200/, 
wherewith an eftate was purchafed; and bifhop Fleming confecrated the chapel, 
in the year 1739. The revenue or falary is now about 20 / per annum, and 
the curate hath a good houfe at Petrel Crooks, being part of the purchafed 
eftate. In the act of coniecration, the nomination of the curate is referved 
to the dean and chapter ; neverthelefs the curates, as appears from the bi- 
fhop's archives, have been appointed by the 12 men or felect veftry ; as,

That which is now the diocefe of CarliQe, was heretofore part of the 
dioctie of Lindisfarne, from whence the Ice was removed to Chefier on the 
Street, and afterwards to Durham ; and by reafon of the diftance of Carlifle 
from the epifcopal fee, king Henry the fir ft, in the year 1133, founded this 
bifheprick of Carlifle, and beftowed it upon Alhelwald (or Adelulph) then 
prior of Carlifle, who was alfo prior of St. Ofwald's in York (hire, the 
king's confeffor. 

1. Adelulph, firft bifhop of Carlifle, appears as a witnefs to a charter of 
king Stephen, in 1136. He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac abbot 
of Fountains to the archbifhoprick of York, and notwithftanding king Stephen's 
denunciation of wrath againft all that primate's adherents, received him 
as his metropolitan when he came to vifit David king of Scots then refiding 
at Carlifle-f. 

Though fome learned perfons have affirmed, that before the ftatute of 
mortmain 7 Ed. 1. impropriations were very rare in England ; yet this bifhop 
Adelulph, or Athdwald (as he is now called), who died above ico years before 
the enacting of that law, confirmed the churches of Wetheral and Warwick, 
St. Michael and St. Laurence Appleby, Kirk by Stephen, Ormefhead, Mor- 
â€¢iand, Clibburn, Bromrkkl, Croglyn, and the hermitage of St. Andrew in the 
â€¢parifh of Kiikland, to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, with this 
tingle provifo, that the laid abbot and convent fhould allow fuch a portion 
to the officiating minilter, as thereby he may be decently maintained, and be 
able to pay his iynodals Â£, 

This bifhop died in 1155.

2. Bernard. â€” The church of St. Mary Magdalen of Lanercoft, was de- 
dicated by bifhop Bernard in the year 1169, being the 12th of his pontifi- 
cate f ; and he died in 1186. .After whofe death, it was a long time before 
the fee was regularly i'v pplied. King Hen. 2. being then at Carlifle, offered 
the vacant bifhoprick to one Paulinus de Leedes, who refufed it, notwith- 
standing that the king promifed, upon his acceptance of it, to augment the 
revenues by an acceffion of 300 marks rent out of the churches of Bambrough 
and Scai borough, with the chapel of Tickhill, together with two of his own 
manors which lay near that city J. 

In 1 188, the temporakies continuing in the king's hand, the following par- 
ticulars amongft others were brought into account at the trealury : For oil for 
the facrament at Eafter two terms and carrying the fame from London to Car- 
lifle 14/. In work of the greater altar and pavement in the church of St. 
Mary Carlifle 27 s gd. In work of the dormitory of the canons 22/ igs 2d. 

In 1200, king John granted this bifhoprick to the archbifhop of Sclavonia, 
to fupport him for the prefent. 

In 1203, the fame king confirms a grant from the pope of the vacant 
bifhoprick of Carlifle to the archbifhop of Ragufa, who was forced to abandon 
his own fee, and had not wherewithal to fupport himfelf. 

In the firfl year of king Henry the third, the canons of Carlifle (fays. 
Prynne) contemning both the pope's and his legate's authority and cenfures, 
contumacioufly celebrating divine fervice and facraments, notwithftanding. 
their interdicts â€¢, adhering, fubmitting, and fwearing fealty to the king of 
Scots, king Henry's and the pope's declared enemy ; yea electing an inter- 
dicted and excommunicated clerk for their bifhop againft the king's and the 
legate's will ; and dividing the ancient revenues of the bifhoprick amongfl 
themfelves : the young king's council thereupon fent this epiftle to the pope 
Honorius the third in the king's name, totally to remove the'fe fchifmatical 
canons, and place prebends in their rooms, to augment the bifhop's revenues 
(being fo fmall, that no able and loyal perfon would accept thereof), and to 
difplace the obtruded bifhop : " Reverendo domino ac patri in Chriflo cha-

which letter, the pope ordered Gualo his legate, by the king's royal aGfent, to 
conftitute Hugh abbot of Belieu bifhop of Carliflef. 

The chapter in the mean time were but in a forry fituation, which the Chro- 
nicle of Lanercoil thus defcribes : â€” The canons of Carlifle were banifhed by 
Gualo the legate, becaufe through fear of death they had performed divine 
fervice to the excommunicated king of Scotland, 

3. Hugh. By two records in 12 18, tranfcribed by Mr. Prynne, it appears 
that this bifhop Hugh was abbot of Belieu, and promoted to this fee by car- 
dinal Gualo the pope's legate; yet king Hen. 3. acknowledges him to be 
fidclis tiofter, cid multo tenemnr debito ; ac fanÂ£l<Â£ Romana ecclefite devotijfimus : 
and hereupon begs the pope's affiftance in getting the rectories of Penrith,.

This bifhop was one of the fureties of king Hen. 3. for the performance 
of that memorable accord now made with Alexander the fecond, king of Scot- 
land, who was to marry one or other of the king's fillers J. 

The author of the Chronicle of Lanercoft feems to have been no friend to 
this bifhop. He fays, Hugh bifhop of Carlifie, who alienated the pofieflions 
of the fee, and made a fraudulent divifion thereof, returning from the Roman 
court, by the juft judgment of God perifhed miferably, at the abbey of la 
Ferte in the parts of Burgundy. 

4. Walter Malclerk, (fo called from his deficiency in learning,) was 
about Afcenfion day in 1223 confecrated bifhop of Carlifie, by "Walter Grey 
archbifhop of York and lord chancellor; and on the 26th of October follow- 
ing the king confirmed the election, and reftored to him the temporalties-j-. 

A year or two before this, the order of Dominicans (or Friers predicants) 
-came firft into England ; and this bifhop was one of their mott early and moft 
generous benefactors, giving them a considerable plot of ground in the Old 
Jewry, and two mills without the fouth gate at Oxford*. 

Before his promotion to the fee of Carlifie, king John (whofe great fa- 
vourite he was) had employed him as his ambaffador at Rome, on the conteft 
with his barons Â§. 

In 1250, king Hen. 3. granted to this bifhop and his fucceffors the manor 
â€¢of Dalfton, in a more full and ample form than was ufual in that age||. 

In 1232, king Hen. 3. in the 6th year of his reign, by his charter granted 
the treafury of his exchequer of England to Walter Mauclerk bifhop of Car- 
lifie, to hold during his life ; with all the liberties and appurtenances to the 
faid treafury belonging: i~o that he fhould have and keep the /aid treafury ac 
the king's exchequer in his own perfon, or by a difcreet and fufficient deputy, 
which deputy fhould be fworn to ferve faithfully in his office ; and if fuch 
deputy fhould die, or become pcofeffed of religion, or for reafonable caufe 
fhould be removed by the king or the treafurer, or fhould himfelf be unwilling 
to ferve any longer, then the faid treafurer fhould fubftitute fome other difcreet 
and fit perfon to ferve in the room of fuch deputy ; and the perfon fo fub- 
ftituted was to be likewife fworn to ferve faithfully. The next year the king, 
at the inliigation of Peter bifhop of Winchefter his chief jufticiar, and to 
make way for ftrangers of Poictiers, removed moft of his court officers, and 
among the reft turned this bifhop out of his office of high treafurer in a 
difgraceful manner, fining him ioo/, and cancelling feveral grants which he 
had made to him for life, and by patent committed the treafury of his exche- 
quer with the appurtenances to Peter de Rival), to hold during the king's 
pleafure. And Walter was commanded to deliver by view and teltimony of

true men the keys of the treafury and all things belonging to it by inventory 
to Peter de Rivall or to Robert Paffelowe his attorney nominated by him for 
that purpofe before the king. Afterwards the king commanded S. de Segrave 
his jufticiar to give poffeffion of the treafury to the faid Peter or Robert his 
attorney, in cafe the bifhop of Carlifle refufed to deliver it-f . 

The late treafurer feems to have intended to go to Rome for redrefs, and 
got as far as Dover, where he put himfelf on board a fhip ; but prefently 
fome of the lung's officers brought both him and his effects on fhore again, 
requiring him not to depart the kingdom, without the king's fpecial licence in 
that behalf firft obtained. The bifhop of London happening to arrive there 
from Rome at that inflant, and being an eye-witnefs to the outrages done to 
his brother prelate, immediately excommunicated all the afTailants ; and 
polling thence to the king at Hereford, renewed his fentence, and was there 
ieconded by all the bifhops then prefent at court J. 

In 1234, the king again received bifhop Walter into favour^. 

And in the next year, ar the in fiance of the faid bifhop, king Henry was 
affianced to the earl of Winchefler's fair daughter; but the match was broken 
off for certain reafons of ftate. She was afterwards married to Alphonfus 
king of Caftile \[. 

In 1236, he was one of the witnefles to the king's ratification of the great 
charter, the king being then arrived to the age of 21 years* ; and to the duke 
of Brabant's engagement to conduct the princefs Ifabella (the king's filler) to 
tier hufband the emperor Â§. 

In 1239, fte was a PPÂ°i nI:e d catechift to prince Edward. 

In 1243, ki n S Henry being beyond the feas, conftituted the archbifhop of 
York, the bifhop of Carlifle, and William de Cantilupe, lords juftices of the 
realm in his abfence, to whom he gave feveral authentic inftrudtions for the 
preventing of innovations and incroachments upon the ancient laws of the 
land. In one of thtfe they are particularly directed to reftrain the prior and 
convent of Canterbury from the exercife of archiepifcopal authority (fede 
vacante) over the fuffragan bifhops of that province, and this upon folemn 
complaint of the faid bifhops themfelves, alledging that fuch an ufurpation 
was not only a great injury to themfelves, but in manifeft prejudice of the 
royal dignity-f- *. 

In 1244, he had the ward fhip of Walter fon of Odard de Wigton (a child 
of two months) granted to him by the king; and. with, him the manors of 
Wigton, Melmerby, Stainton on Eden, Blackhill, and Warwick. 

In 1245, that this bifhop might make his will, and therein difpofe of his 
goods and chattels, he procured the following royal difpenfation, according to 
the cuftom of thofe times : " Rex omnibus, &c, falutem. Sciatis quod tefta-

In this fame year, the pope granted to the bifhops of Scotland (jealous of 
falling under the archbifhop of York's jurifdiftion) that none of his delegates 
fhould call any of their caufes farther than the cities and diocefes of Durham 
or Carlifle %$. 

The annals of Waverley give this farther account of him : In the year of 
our lord 1246, Walter bifhop of Carlifle, divinely infpired (as it is believed), 
refigning his bifhopiick, betook himfelf to the order of friers predicant at 
Oxford ; and having done many memorable things in buildings and other 
matters, he died at Oxford on the 28th of October 1248. 

5. Sylvestfr de Everdow, archdeacon of Chefter, was confirmed bifhop 
of Carlitle on the ninth of November 1246, and had reftitution of the tempo- 
ralties on the 8th of December following. 

In 1247, this bifhop, by an inftrument fealed at London, confirms the 
grants of his prerieceffors of the churches of St Michael and St. Laurence in 
Applebv, Kirkby Stephen, and Morland, to the abbot and convent of St. 
Mary's York *. And in the next year, the faid abbot and convent made a 
grant to the bifhop and h : s fuccefTors of the perpetual advowfon of the vicarage 
of St. Michael's, taxed at 20 marks 7. 

In the fine rolls, 32 H. 3 are the following pleas : Between Silvefter bifhop 
of Carlifle and William Huncecomb for 20/ land and rent in Tynton, Ma- 
ringes, and Horncaftie-, and between the fame bifhop and John de Leweby, 
for 20/ land and rent in Endei by, Wilhiby, and Caningeby, and the advowfon 
of the church of Morefby ; as the right of his fee and church of Carlifle. 
And he granted to the faid William and John the homage and fervices of Ivo 
fon of Odo in Tymleby for the eighth part of one knight's fee : and their 
freemen were to do fuit of court to the bifhop and his fuccefTors at Horncaftie 
at two law days after the feaft of St. Michael and Eafter, and at other times 
upon reafonable fummons when judgment is to be given on a plea moved by 
the king's writ, or a felon is to be tried in the fame court. 

In 1253, this bifhop, with the archbifiiop of Canterbury and others, op- 
pofed the king's incroachments upon the liberties of the church â€¢, particularly 
in the freedom of electing bifhops. The fharp return which the king made 
to this bifhop is very remarkable, " Et te, Silvefter Carleolenfis, qui diu 1am- 
" bens cancellariatn clericorum meorum clericulus extitifti, qualiter poftpofitis 
" multis 'heologis et perfonis reverendis te in epifcopatum fublegavi Â£."

About this time the bifhop of Rochefter petitioned the pope for an enlarge-

In 1255 tms bifhop died by a fall from his horfe. It is faid, that the feal 
which he made ufe of in all publick inftruments had on one fide a bifhop 
cloathed in his pontificals, and on the reverfe the figure of the bleffed virgin 
with our Saviour in her arms, with this motto around, according to the bar- 
barous latin of thofe times, " Te rogo, virgo Dei, Sis vigil erga mei." 

6*. Thomas Vipont, or de Veteripcnte, of the illuflrious family of the then 
lords of Weftmorland. On the 5th of November 1255 tne king confirms the 
election of the bifhop, and on the 24th of December following, reftores the 
temporalties, requiring Robert de Dacre (cuflosof the vacant fee) to refign up 
his charge. This bifhop died in October following. When the bifhop of 
Durham fequeftring all the benefices of the faid deceafed prelate within his 
diocefe, and the guardian of the vacant bifhoprick of Carlifle (Walter de Rud- 
ham) endeavouring to fue out an inhibition for the removal of the faid fequef- 
tration, the king iffued his royal writ to the guardian, commanding him to let 
all things continue in the ftate they then were, till the day he had appointed to 
hear and determine the matter. Afterwards the bifhop of Durham had a day 
afiigned him in the king's court, to fhew what right he had or pretended to 
have to the fequeftration of the benefices belonging to the bifhoprick of Car- 
lifle during the vacancy in the king's hand. At length it feems the king was 
fatisfied of the juftnefs of the faid bifhop's claim ; and therefore he commanded 
not only the prefent profits, but thofe alfo of a former vacancy to be delivered 
to him. This writ was in the following form : " Rex abbati de Novo Mona- 
fterio [Newminfter near Morpeth] falutem. Quia de confilio magnatum qui

Another fort of claim was alfo fet up by the bifhop of Glafgow. For we 
are told by the author of the Chronicle of Lanercoft, that in the year 1258, 
John de Glenham fucceeded in the church of Glafgow, being collated thereto 
by the pope, and confecrated at Rome; an Englifhman born, but no friend 
to the Englifh. For in the latter part of his days, his covetoufnefs increafing 
with his years, he pretended an ancient right in the parts of Cumberland and 
Weftmorland, faying that his diocefe extended as far as Rerecrofs upon Stane- 
more. And haflening upon that occafion to the court of Rome, he died in his 
journey; 

7. Robert Chause. This bifhop's furname is varioufly written, occa- 
fioned probably from the difficulty of reading it in old records, and the furname 
of a biiliop being feldom mentioned. Bifhop Nicolfon fays, his name in the 
record is Robert de Chaury. Bifhop Goodwin, as alfo Ifaacfon in his chrono- 
logical account of the bifhops, call him Robert Chaufe. In the lift of fheriffs 
for the county of Cumberland (of which county this bifhop was fheriff in the 
56 Hen. 3. and 1 Ed. I.) his name is written Chauncey. He was archdeacon 
of Bath â€¢, his election to this fee was confirmed on the 12th of February 
1258, and his temporalties reftored on the 19th of September following. 

In 1266, at Bewley, this bifhop releafed the guardianship of the cell of We- 
therhall (being then vacant of a prior) in confideration of the remiffion of two 
marks annual penfion out of the rectory of Denton. 

In the firft year of Ed. 1. the then lord chancellor was informed by Richard 
de Crepping fheriff of the county of Cumberland, that the bifhop of Carlifle 
had forbidden his tenants to take the oath of fealty to the king â€¢, whereupon 
that prelate certified the lord chancellor that the information was falfe and 
groundlefs \ for that he had by mefTage requefted the faid fheriff (then refiding 
at Appleby in Weftmorland) that he would either by himfelf or his deputy admi- 
nifter to them the faid oath. He therefore humbly requefts, that the chancellor 
would either command the fheriff to receive that fealty which they were thus 
ready to pay, or to appoint fome other perfon to do it-, profeffing (for himfelf 
and his dependents) that they were ever ready to give all imaginable affurances 
of their juft duty and fidelity to his majefty. 

This complaint feems to have occafioned the bifhop's excommunicating the 
faid fheriff, upon application of the abbot of Holm Cultram, on whom the 
fheriff had made fome diflrefTes for debts owing to the crown. And this 
occafioned a writ of prohibition, requiring the bifhop to revoke his ecclefi- 
aftical cenfure. 

Mr. Prynne takes notice of a record after the death of this bifhop, to the 
following purport : The prior and convent of Carlifle were attached to an-

fwer our lord the king, why after the death of Robert bifhop of Carlifle, when 
they had requefted and obtained (according to cuftom) leave to chufe another 
bifhop, and they had cholen William dean of York, whofe eledion was fo- 
lemnly notified and pubhfhed; yet they, on the faid William's refufal to ac- 
cept the office, had proceeded to chufe another bifhop, without any leave re- 
quefted or obtained ; to the prejudice of the king and his crown, and his da- 
mage of fixty thoufand pounds; â€” and why, after they had received an inhi- 
bition from the king's jufticiars John de Vallibus and Thomas de Satrington, 
they yet proceeded to chufe another bifhop, in contempt of the king and to 
his damage of forty thoufand pounds. The prior returneth anfwer and faith, 
that he and his convent did not underftand that they had done any contempt or 
prejudice to the king-, for that having obtained leave to eled, and the perfon 
elected difagreeing to the eledion, they thought it was res Integra, and they 
ruioht proceed to chufe again; but if it was a contempt, they iubmit them- 
felves to the king's pleafure f. 

Which matter is fet in a fuller light by a bull of pope Nicholas the third, 
dated 5 Id. Apr. A. D. 1280, and direded to the aforefaid king Edward the 
flrft. His hoiinefs therein informs his dear fon, that the prior and convent of 
Carlifle, upon the death of their late bifhop Robert, had proceeded to the 
eledion of a new bifhop by way of compromife among themfelves, according 
to the accuftomed rule which then generally obtained in chufing of bifhops ; 
and that in fuch their election they had chofen one mafter William dean of 
York, who refufed to accept of the charge, and fent back an authentic dis- 
claimer of all the right which could accrue to him by virtue of the faid choice. 
Hereupon they proceeded to a new election, but according to their old form. 
No new application upon this was made to the king, though there had been 
upon the other vacancy. But a certain day was appointed, and notice given 
to the chapter to convene. Being met, their flrft work (in obfervance of the 
methods of a capitular compromife on fuch occafions) was to devolve the whole 
power of their body upon five of their members, who were, the prior Robert 
de Everdon, the precentor, the luccentor, the cellararius, and the fubfacrift. 
Thefe five eled Ralph prior of Gifburne, and the whole chapter prefent him 
to Walter archbifhop of York, who happened to die before he could confirm 
the eKdtion. Upon this the chapter of York is prefently applied to for the 
faid confirmation. â€” But fuch delays were made by them, that the electors were 
neceffitated to appeal to Rome. The pope, to make a fhort end of a vexa- 
tious caufe, forthwith appoints three commiffioners, who find (and make their 
report accordingly) that the election is null; forafmuch as it was nor, accord- 
ing to the ufage and canons of the Roman fee, pronounced by one of the 
eledors fingly, notwithftanding it did not appear but that they had all unani- 
moufly concurred in it. However, the pope refolves, through the plenitude 
of his own power, to remedy this irregularity ; and therefore, being well fa- 
tisfied of the good learning and other extraordinary qualifications of the man, 
confers the vacant bifhopnek upon Ralph by way of provifion, declaring all 

f Pryn. v. 3. p. 1230. 

L 1 2 his 



tfp CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 

his tide to be once more void and null, if claimed upon any other foun- 
dation %. 

Mr. Prynne takes notice, that the parliament to which the prior and convent 
were fummoned to fhew caufe as aforefaid, was held foon after Eafter, whilft 
the bifhop elect was foliciting his caufe at Rome in perlon ; the chapter, un- 
certain what would be the iffue, thought fit (in cafe judgment fhould be given 
againft them here at home) to throw themfelves into the king's mercy. And 
the pope, cautioufiy declining the giving countenance (barefaced) to an election 
thus independent on the king's authority, difcovers another fort of nullity in 
the proceedings, which makes way for the exercife of his provifionary power, 
in making this prelate a creature of his own. And we quickly fee king Edward 
as tamely fubmits to the Roman pontiff, as the prior and convent had done 
before to their liege fovereign. 

8. Ralph Irton, being of the family of Irton in Cumberland, and then 
prior of Gifburne, was elected by the prior and convent of Carlifle as aforefaid,. 
and appointed thereto by the pope by way of provifion ; which king Ed. i. 
fubmitting to, reftored him the temporalties on the ioth of July 1280. 

This bifhop held a convocation of his clergy at Carlifle in October in the 
fame year ; when they granted the tenth of all their ecclefiaftical livings ac- 
cording to their real value for two years. 

In 1281, he recovered the manor and church of Dalfton againft Sir Michael 
deHarcla. 

In 1290, he was one of the plenipotentiaries of king Edward the firft in the 
treaty with the commiffioners of Scotland, for a marriage to be had and fo- 
lemnized between prince Edward and Margaret daughter of Eric king of Nor- 
way, hereditary princefs and queen of Scotland. Which treaty, with eon- 
cefhons of privileges to the Scottifh nation, was fully concluded, and was alfo 
immediately ratified by the king himfelf *. 

The fame year commenced a remarkable fuit between the king, the bifhop, 
the prior and convent, and the parfon of Thurfby, feverally claiming right of 
tithes in fome new improved lands within the foreft of Englewood. " Radul-

king ; and he granted the fame afterwards to the prior and convent J. 

The cornu eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of Carlifle, a fymbol (very 
probably) of fome of king Henry the firft's grants to the priory, but in none 
of thofe grants, of which any copy is now extant, do thole tithes appear. The 
ceremony of inveftiture with a horn or other like fymbol is very ancient, and 
was in ufe before there were any written charters. We read of Ulf, a Danifh 
prince, who gave all his lands to the church of York: And the form of the 
endowment was this ; he brought the horn, out of which he ufually drank, filled 
with wine, and before the high altar kneeling devoutly,- drank the wine, and 
by that ceremony enfeoffed the church with all his lands and revenues. 

King Canute, another Dane, gave lands at Puley in Bcrkfhire to the family 
Â©f that name there, with a horn folemnly delivered as a confirmation of the 
giant; which horn, it is faid, is ftill there to be feen. 

So king Edward the confeffor granted to Nigel the huntfman an hide of 
land called Dere Hide, and a wood called Hulewood, with the cuftody of the 
foreft of Bernwood, to hold of the king to him and his heirs by one horn, 
which is the charter of the faid foreft. 

So that not the Danes only, but the Englifh Saxons alfo, were acquainted 
with this ancient cuftom. Thus Ingulphus abbot of Crowland, who lived in 
the time of William the Conqueror, acquaints us that it continued down to 
his time. He tells us, that many eftates were granted by word only, without 
writing; as by delivery of a fword, an helmet, a horn r or cup, and fuchlike: 
but this mcd.% he fays, in after times was changed. 

Ulf's horn at York, when the reformation began in king Edward the fixth's 
rime, was fvvept away amongft many other coftly ornaments, and fold to a 
goldfmith, who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was 
adorned, and the gold chain which was affixed to it. After which time, the 
horn itfelf, cut in ivory, of an octagon form, came into the hands of general 
Fairfax; who being a lover of antiquities, preferved it during the confufions â–  
of the civil wars ; v/hofe memory is defervedly honoured for other generous 
actions of this nature, fuch as allowing Mr. Dodfworth the antiquarian a yearly 
falary to preferve the infcriptions in churches, the giving his valuable manu- 
fcripts to the univerfity of Oxford, and his preferving the public library there 3 
as he did the cathedral at York from being fpoiled and defaced after the fur- 
renoer of the city. And he dying in 1671, this horn came into the poffeffion 
of his n^xt kiniman Henry lord Fairfax, who ornamented it anew, andreftored 
it to its ancient repofitory, where it now remains a noble monument of mo- 
dern as well as ancient piety *.

In the fame year 1290, the king granted to this bifhop the advowfon of the 
church of Rothbury, which he had ""recovered from his predeceflbr Robert 
Chaufe : as alfo free warren in his manors of Dalfton and Linftock. 

In 1291, a protection was granted under the king's great feal of Scotland, 
bearing date Aug. 14, to Ralph bifhop of Carlifle and A. bifhop of Cathncfs, 
for their joint collection of the tenths of that kingdom -j-. 

In this fame year, June 5, the faid bifhop was one of king Edward's com- 
mifTioners for adjufting the right claim to the crown of Scotland ; and was there 
prefent at the debates on th= 13th of the fame month, as likewifeon the 14th 
of Auguft following Â£, 

He is alfo one of the witneffes to king Edward's claim of right to the king- 
dom of Scotland, upon the death of the forementicned queen Margaret, dated 
at Norham 12 May 1291 ||. 

On the firft of March following he died at LinHock. For being fatigued 
(fays the Chronicle of Lanercoft) with a tedious journey in deep fnow in re- 
turning from the parliament at London, and refrefhing himfelf very plentifully, 
he had a mind to go to reft ; and a vein burfting in his fleep he was found fuf- 
focated with blood. 

9. John Halton. He was fome time canon regular at Carlifle; and was 
on the 9th of May 1292 elected bifhop. Which the king approving, he fent 
his mandate to John de Crancumb the archbifhop of York's vicar general (the 
archbifhop himfelf being then in foreign parts) to do his duty herein â€¢, who 
confirming the election, the king rtftored the temporalties by a writ to his 
efcheator. Dated at Berwick upon Tweed, July rb*Â§. 

It feems that this bifhop was prefently admitted into his predecefTor's place 
in king Edward's commiffion for hearing the plea of the feveral pretenders to 
the crown and realm of Scotland â€¢, fince we find him prefent in November 1292, 
when fentence was given againft Robert Bruce, and when John Baliol did ho- 
mage for the whole kingdom of Scotland with the appurtenances to his fove- 
reign lord the king of England 4- 

About this time, this bifhop entertained the archbifhop of York John Ro- 
manus at his caftle of Linftock, going to view his manor of Extildes, with 
three hundred attendants *. 

In 1294, being commanded by Edward the firft to go on fome fpecial errand 
to (his vaflal) John Baliol king of Scots, he had letters of fafe conduct for 
himfelf and family from that feudatory prince, dated at Edinburgh*. 

And at this time, as well as a good while before and after, he was autho- 
rifed by the pope for the collecting of the tenths in the feveral diocefes of 
Scotland, which gave him a great deal of trouble in fending minatory letters 
and fometimes bulls of excommunication, againft the bifhops, abbots, and 
others *.

The king about tlvs time lodged at the bifhop's houfe at Rofe; for from 
thence (on the 25th and 26th of September) are fome of his letters dated *. 

In 1302, this bifhop was governor of the king's caftle at Carlifle, and had 
therein the keeping and care of all the Scotch hoftages and prifoners of note 
that lay there ; many of whom, as appears from his accounts, died in durance. 
H^ alfo took care of all repairs there in timber, (tone, and other materials. 
The whole of one year's receipt from the crown amounts to 270/ 2s od y and 
his difburfements to 275/ 14J jdf. 

In 1305, pope Clement the fifth, in the firfb year of his pontificate, at the 
requeft of king Edward, gave a commiffion to the archbifhop of York and 
bilhop of Carlifle, to excommunicate by bell, book, and candle, Robert de 
Brus earl of Carrick and all his adherents, for the murder of John Comyn in 
the church of Dumfries ; which was executed accordingly J. 

In the-year following, the faid bifhop of Carlifle (together with the abbots 
of York, St. Albans, and Waltham) had another commiffion from the fame 
pope, to abfolve all fuch prel.ites, clergy, and other Englifh fubjects, as had 
or might think themfelves to have incurred the fentence of irregularity or ex- 
communication, by flaying any of king Edward's enemies, wounding the clergy, 
or defacing churches, in his late wars in Scotland ||. 

On the 8th of September 1305, he petitioned the pope to canonize St. Tho- 
mas de Cantelupe late bifhop of Hereford Â§. 

In 1307, in the parliament holden at Carlifle this year, he petitioned the 
king for a piece of ground within the precin&s of the caftle towards Caldew, 
but within the city walls, for building an houfe for himfelf and fuccefibrs j 
whereupon an inquifition ad quod damnum was directed, but the return is not 
mentioned 4.. 

In 1308, bilhop Halton was fumrnoned (pro forma) to attend the corona- 
tion of king Edward the fecond JJ. 

In 13 14, this bilhop was with the neighbouring gentlemen in Carlifle, when 
the town was blocked up by Edward Bruce. And from thence he dates a 
proxy to two clergymen of his own diocefe, the rectors of Levington and Burgh 
under Stanemore, to appear for him in the parliament at Weftminfter, excunng 
his perfonal attendance on account of thefe Scotch troubles **â– . 

In 13 1 8, in recompence of the many and great fervices and fufTerings of 
the (now aged) bifhop of Carlifle, king Edward the fecond addreiTed the pope 
for the appropriation of the church of Horncaftle in the diocefe of Lincoln 
(being in the patronage of the faid bifhop) to his own ufe, and to annex the 
fame for ever to the bifhoprick of Carlifle â€¢, that he and his fuccefibrs, during 
the ravages of the neighbouring enemy, may have a place of refuge, and out 
of the profits of the church may be able to fupport themfelves -f-f-. Some 
years before this, the king hid granted his own royal licence, infignificant (as 
it feems) without a confirmation from Rome, for the faid appropriation. And

in this fame year, the bifhop himfelf defires one of the cardinals to make the 
like interceflion to the pope ; as alfo for a remiffion of a penfion paid to the 
papal fee out of the rectory *. 

In 1320, William archbifhcp of York, John bifhop of Carlifle, Robert de 
Baldock archdeacon of Middlefex, and Jeoffrey le Scrop, were appointed the 
king's plenipotentiaries in a treaty of peace with Robert de Bros and his ac- 
complices ; to whom afterwards fome other commiffioners were added -f. 

About the beginning of November in the year 1324 bifhop Halton died ^ 
and in January following the chapter eledled William de Ermyn canon of 
York, who was confirmed by the king on the 17th of the fame January. But 
the pope thought fit to take the difpofal of the bifhopric into his own hand, 
and accordingly gave it to John de Rofs. 

10. John Ross, fome time before Midfummer 1325, brought his credentials 
from Rome; and had thereupon reftitution of the temporahies. 

In 1330, he petitions the pope for fome preferment for his two kinfmen 
John and Henry de Rofs (brothers, born in the diocefe of Hereford) bachelors 
of the civil law. 

The fame year he was cited to appear before the prior of Durham delegate 
of the court of Rome, on a complaint made againft him by the prior and con- 
vent of Carlifle, for debarring them of the peaceable enjoyment of their ap- 
propriated churches of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert within the walls of Carlifle, 
Routhecliffe, Hayton, Ireby, Crofby, Camberton, and Beghokirk â€¢, as like- 
wife for the arbitrary feizing and difpofal of their rents and other goods. â€” Af- 
terwards, the prior neglecting to pay fome tenths that were in his hands, the 
bifhop excommunicated him. 

In 1331, this bifhop refided at Horncaftle, and there confirmed a grant 
made by fome of his tenants to the abbot and convent of Kyrkftede. 

In 1332, he died at Rofe; and was carried into the South to be buried J. 

11. John Kirkby, prior of this cathedral, was elected bifhop, and con- 
firmed by the king, May 8, 1332, and had the temporahies reftored to him 
on the 9th of July following. Soon after, follows this demand of a provifion 
for one of the king's clerks : â€” Edwardus Dei gratia, &c. Venerabili in

" defire, but where he ought â€¢" yet by the common law, the king as founder 
.of archbifhopricks, bifhopricks, and many religious houfes, had a corody or 
penfion in the feveral foundations ; a corody for his vadelets who attended him, 
and a penfion for a chaplain, fuch as he ihould fpecially recommend, till the re- 
fpe&ive poiTefibr fhould promote him to a competent benefice -{-. 

In October 1337, tne Scots burned Rofe, and wafted the country all around J. 

In the foregoing fpring, the bifhop was fet upon in his pafTage through Pen- 
rith, and feveral of his retinue wounded by a band of unknown ruffians ; who 
were denounced excommunicate, by bell, book, and candle |]. 

In the fame year, he certifies the barons of the exchequer, that it is im- 
poffible to levy the tenths, moft of the clergy being fled from the Scots ||. 

In 1 341, a privy feal is directed to the king's receiver of the funds for the 
carrying on the war againft the Scots, requiring him to pay 200/ to the bifhop 
of Carlifle, in part of an arrear of 529/ 4s od for the wages of him and the 
men abiding with him for the fafe keeping of the marches againft Scotland. 
And with this advance, the bifhop promifes immediately to engage again in 
the fame fervice-J-. 

In 1342, the chapter of York (the fee being vacant, and the dean living in 
remote parts) fell hard upon the bifhop upon an appeal from the parifliioners 
of St. Mary's in Carlifle, to whom the chapter there (too much countenanced 
by the bifhop) had refufed an eftablifhed vicar Â§. 

The fame bifhop alfo, after fufpenfion, was excommunicated, for non-pay- 
ment of 60/ 5s S^d tenths in Lincolnshire to the pope Â§. 

In 1343, Richard bifhop of Durham, and John bifhop of Carlifle, with 
fome great men of the laiety, were appointed commiffioners to treat with others 
from Scotland, touching the fettling and preferving of peace and commerce, 
in all places except in catties and walled towns upon the borders **. 

But in the next year, both thefe bifhops, as likewife the archbifhop of York, 
are required to be aiding and aflifting to Edward Baliol king of Scots, whom 
our king Edward conftitutes his captain general of all his northern forces, and 
to pay the fame regard to his orders and commands, as they would do to thofe 
of their fovereign himfelf ff. 

In 1348, the bifhop of Carlifle being appointed to convey the princefs Joan 
(affianced to Alphonfus king of Caftile, and bearing the title of queen of Spain) 
to her hufband, notwithftanding the unfortunate iffue of that journey, had on 
his return a warrant to the lord treafurer, barons, and chamberlains of the

king's exchequer of fuch daily allowance of board wages (viz. 5 marks) as he 
had prudently contracted for before his fetting out *. 

This bifhop feems to have had a very uneafy time â€¢, being conftantly alarmed 
and inveterately perfecuted by the Scots in his own diocefe. And for that 
reafon he was frequently abroad, holding many of his ordinations at or near 
Horncaille and Melborn, and fometimes at London, Durham, and Corbridge, 
He was alio engaged in abundance of fuics with his chapter, archdeacon, and 
others, in the courts of Rome, Weftminiter, and York. 

He died in 1352; and thereupon the chapter of Carlifle, with the king's 
leave, once more made choice of their own prior John de Horncaftle to be 
their bifhop; who was confirmed, and had reftitution of the temporalties : 
But the pope thought proper to appoint another, viz. 

12, Gilbert Welton, who being confecrated by the pope or his order, 
the king in humble obedience to the pope's plenitude of power revoked the 
writ for reftitution of the temporalties to John de Horncaille, and granted the 
fame to Gilbert de Welton. 

One of the firft things in this bifhop's regifter is, a commiffion to convene 
the clergy of the diocefe of Carlifle for granting a fubfidy to the bifhop. How 
much was given is not faid. But that the fynod had done gracioufly, was ac- 
knowledged in another commiffion for the collecting of the bounty in March 
following. And in his fourth year they gave him 200 marks. 

Edward the third being in a manner oppreffed with the multitude of his 
Scotch prifoners taken at the battle of Durham, and being inclinable to fet at 
liberty on reafonable terms the king of Scotland David de Brus his captive brother- 
in-law, conftituted the bifhops of Durham and Carlifle his commiffioners in 
a treaty of peace, and granted to them and others the ample powers follow-

thereupon it was agreed with the commiflioners of Scotland, that the faid 
David mould be releaied, paying a ranfom of 90,000 marks fterling in nine 
years. But the bifhop of Carlifle is not mentioned as prefent at this treaty, 
though all the reft (as likewife Gilbert de Umfrevill earl of Angus, who was 
added to the fecond commiflion) are faid to have been there â€¢, but his name is 
inferted in all the king's inftruments of ratification thereupon. â€” Another com- 
miflion was again granted in 1356, to the bifhops of Durham and Carlifle, 
with their forementioned fellows ; in purfuance whereof ic was agreed, that 
David Ihould be delivered up to his friends at Berwick the year following : 
And to this purpofe other powers were given to the commiflioners ; unto whom 
were now added the archbifhop of York and Thomas de Mufgrave -f\ 

In 1359, July 8, the king conftitutes the bifhop of Carlifle and Thomas dc 
Lucy, jointly and feverally, wardens of the weftern marches J. 

In 1360, king Edward the third having accepted the furrender of the king- 
dom of Scotland (in exchange for a penfion of 2000/ fterling) from Edward 
Baliol, and fent back Edward de Brus to his friends in that country, began 
now to think of perfecting a defign which he had long been forming; which 
was, the entering into a firm bond of peace and amity with his aforelaid 
brother-in-law David, and formally acknowledging him king of Scots ; and 
for that end grants a commiflion to the archbifhop of York, the bifhops of 
Durham and Carlifle, and others ||. And in 1362, the bifhop of Carlifle was 
again joined with the fame commiflioners, with new powers to the like 
effed Â§. 

Bifhop Welton dying in the latter end of this year, the king (Jan. 18.) 
granted his Conge d'Eflire to the chapter, upon their humble petition to eleci: 
a new bifhop. 

In this bifhop's regifter are many letters and commiflions for the raifing of 
charitable contributions towards the repair of the public bridges at Carlifle, 
Salkeld, Kirkby Thore, as likewife for the fupport of his own and other 
cathedrals.

vacate the ele&ion, but appointed the fame perfon by provifion to be their bi- 
fhop. He was confecrated at Avignon on the 1 8th of June 1363, and had 
reftitution of the temporalties on the 10th of Auguft following. 

In 1364, the bifhop of Carlifle is enumerated amongft thole prelates, who 
took an oath in the king's prefence, in his palace at Weftminfter, to obferve 
inviolably all the articles of peace lately concluded and agreed upon by his 
majefty and the French king f. 

In 1366, a commiffion for wardens of the weftern marches was granted to 
Thomas bifliop of Carlifle, Roger de Clifford, Anthony de Lucy, and Ralph 
de Dacre. 

In 1369, the dean rural of Cumberland is required by the bifhop, in obedi- 
ence to the king's writ, to fummon all abbots, priors, and other religious and 
ecclefiaftical perfons, to array all the fencible men between the ages of 16 and 
fixty, upon apprehenfion of a defcent from France. And in the fame year, a 
commiffion for wardens of the weft marches is granted to the bifhop of Car- 
lifle, Roger de Clifford, Thomas de Mufgrave, and divers others Â£. 

In 1372, the king being alarmed with the new league, offenfive and defen- 
five, made between the French king and Robert king of Scots, and the great 
provifions made thereupon by the French king for the invafion of England, 
iflues out his proclamation for the fpeedy arming of all his liege people, 
clergy and laity, between the ages of 1 6 and 60, throughout the whole realm 
of England. And becaufe he was mod efpecially apprehenfive of the Scot- 
tish king's breaking in at the fame time upon the borders, his firft care was to 
write a circular letter to the bifhops of Durham and Carlifle, Gilbert de Um- 
franvil earl of Angus, Henry Percy, Roger Clifford, and Ralph lord Dacre, 
requiring them forthwith to repair to their eftates and interefts in the north, 
there to keep their conftant refidence, and to put themielves into the belt 
condition they can, with the whole power of their refpective retinues and fol- 
lowers, to oppoie any fudden incurfion or attempt that fhould happen from 
their neighbouring enemies. And to encourage them the better herein, he 
affures them that the county troops and others, under the power of general 
array within all the northern counties, together with the hobelarii (or light 
horfemen) and archers in thofe parts fhould join them and be under their com- 
mand, as intirely as their own domeftics ;Â£. 

In 1373, a commiffion was iffued to Thomas bifhop of Durham, Thomas 
bifhop of Carlifle, Edward Mortimer earl of March, Roger de Clifford, 
Ralph de Dacre, Richard de Stafford, Henry le Scrop, Thomas de Mufgrave, 
and matter John de Appleby (probably the bifhop's brother) dean of St. 
Paul's, or any fix of them, to hear and determine all complaints and caufes 
of action upon the borders, on occafion of the breach of the articles of truce 
agreed on in any late convention there ; requiring them to lee fatisfa&ion 
made for injuries done by any of the king's fubjec~r.sÂ§.

In 1374, great differences having arifen between Henry lord Percy and 
William earl of Douglafs, touching the foreft of Jedburgh ; the bifhop of 
Carlifle and others are made arbitrators 4-. 

In 1384, king Richard the fecond appoints John bifliop of Durham, 
Thomas bifhop of Carlifle, Henry de Percy earl of Northumberland, John 
de Nevil baron of Raby, and matter John de Waltham fubdean of York, 
fpecial commiffioners and ambaffadors, impowering them or any two of them 
to treat with his adverfary of Scotland, for the renewal of a truce and cefla- 
tion of arms between the two kingdoms, and adjufting all differences amongft 
the borderers Â£. 

In 1392, the bifhops of Durham and Carlifle, together with the earl of 
Northumberland and others, are appointed commiffioners to put in due execu- 
tion that part of a late treaty of peace, concluded with the French king, 
which relates to the kingdom of Scotland*. 

On the 3d of May in the fame year, bifhop Appleby confirms a grant at his 
manor of Rofe, of certain lands given by fome tenants of his at Horncaftle 
to the priorefs and convent of Greenfeld. 

In 1393, J oftn bifhop of St. David's lord treafurer, and Thomas bifhop of 
Carlifle, together with the earl of Northumberland, the lord Nevil, and 
others, are commiffioned to treat with the commiffioners of the king's adver- 
fary of Scotland, either for a perpetual or temporary peace -f. 

And the fame commiffioners for England are the next year commanded to 
proclaim on the borders the articles of a truce concluded with France and 
Scotland Â§. 

In 1395, on the death of bifhop Appleby, the chapter obtained a Conge 
d'Eflire for a new election, which was figned by the king at Chiltern Langley 
on the 13th of December i whereupon they chofe William Stirkland : But 
the pope refufed to confecrate him, and fent them the bifhop of Lifmore, 
Robert Reed. 

14.. Robert Reed was made bifhop by the papal authority in 1396; and 
on the 26th of March following obtained the king's warrant for all the mefne 
profits of the fee from the time of the death of Thomas the late bifhop. He 
was tranflated to Chichefter before the end of the year, and nothing further 
memorable is recorded of him at Carlifle. 

Mr. Bowchier archdeacon of Lewes, in a letter to bifhop Nicolfon dated 
Aug. 9. 1704, fays that he could find but little of this bifhop at Chichefter, 
whither he was quickly removed from Carlifle j and nothing as to his country, 
education, monaftery, benefactions, or place of burial. His regifter is one 
of the few preferved in that church, but there is nothing in it worth taking 
notice of, fave that he was forced by the archbifhop to wear the habit of his 
order, which he had fome years thrown off after he was made bifhop. God- 
win fays little of him, and one thing very falfe, that he built the crofs in the

gave Yapton and Binfted to the church of Chichefter. And his regifter there 
begins Feb. 10, 1396, and ends Apr. 13, .1414. 

15. Thomas Merks, one of the monks of Weftminfter, and mafter of 
divinity, had reftitution of the temporalties of this fee from king Richard the 
iecond, on a provifion made to him by the pope, in the year 1397. 

In 1399, * n tne w ^ of king Richard the fecond, which bears date the 1 6th 
of April in this year, Thomas bilhop of Carlifle is one of the five prelates 
whom that unhappy prince thought fit to join with his nephew the duke of 
Surry and others of his royal relations in the executorlhip, to each of whom 
he bequeathed a gold ring of 20/ value f. And he is the only bilhop, who 
took letters of protection, about the 20th of the fame month, from that 
prince ; obliging himfelf thereby to a perfonal attendance on his majefty 
towards the coaft of Ireland J. 

Henry the fourth came to the crown Sept. 30, in that year : and in his firfr. 
parliament in the very next month, where it may well be thought that 
Richard had not many friends in the houfe, and if any difapproved of the 
proceedings againft him they were too much awed to venture to fpeak in his 
behalf, there was one however bold enough to fay publickly what others only 
thought, namely, Thomas Merks bifhop of Carlifle ; who without regarding 
the motives which might induce him as well as the reft of Richard's friends to 
keep filence, made a long fpeech, wherein he alledged every thing that could 
with any plaufiblenefs be faid for the king depofed and againft the king on the 
throne -[-. On the tenth of January following he was committed for high 
treafon, and the king gave particular directions to his judges how to proceed 
againft bifhops on fuch trials Â§. And he was foon after deprived of his bi- 
Ihoprick. And having for fome time continued a prifoner in the Tower, the 
king confented that he fhould be removed June 23, 1400, to the abbey of 
Weftminfter. And on the 21ft of March following the king was yet more 
companionate to him, and by his letters patent granted to him licence to ob- 
tain from the pope in the court of Rome benefices (epifcopal excepted) to the 
yearly amount of 100 marks*. 

And in the year following, it appearing that the faid Thomas Merks, inftead 
of the. king's abovementioned allowance of 100 marks, had procured bulls 
from the pope for preferments of the yearly value of 300 marks, king Henry 
not only pardons the mifprifion in accepting fuch bulls, but allows him to put 
them in execution||. 

In 1404, Aug. 13. He was inftituted to the rectory of Todenham in Glou- 
cefterfhire ; and on the 13 Jan. 1409, Robert Ely was admitted to the faid 
rectory, upon the death of Thomas Merks.

The inhabitants of the diocefe of Carlifle feem to have long retained 
fomewhat of the lpirit of their late bifhop in adhering to the interefts of king 
Richard the fecond, in oppofition to thofe of his fucceffbr Henry the fourth ; 
â– which occafioned a com minion from the reigning king to bifhop Stirkland 
and others, fetting forth that the king was informed that divers perfons as 
well ecclefiaftical as fecular within the diocefe of Carlifle had given out, that 
Richard the fecond was living and abiding in the parts of Scotland â€¢, he there- 
fore requires them to arreft all fuch perfons and carry them to the next gaol, 
there to remain till the king's pleafure therein be further known f. 

In November following, the king, in confederation of the great lofles lately 
fuftained by his good fubjects in the counties of Northumberland and Cum- 
berland, remits all arrears of fines and amerciaments, tenths, and fifteenths ; 
which was done upon the petition of their reprefentatives in parliament, 
letting forth the mifery of thofe parts, occafioned by the late incurfions and 
devaluations of the Scots.]-. 

In the fame year the bifhop pafTes a fine, in confirmation of the appro- 
priated tithes of Horncaftle. 

In 1404, amongft the records in the Tower there is an extraordinary grant

In 1406, the bifhop of Carlifle was one of the prelates that figned and 
fealed the act of fucceffion, which intailed the crowns of England and France 
upon the king's four fons.[-. 

It is faid that he built the tower and belfrey in the cathedral church, and 
furnifhed it with four large bells, covering the pyramid on the tower with 
lead ; and that he furnifhed the tabernacle work in the quire. He built the 
tower at Rofe, which ftill goes by the name of Stirkland tower. And he 
was at the expence of drawing a watercourfe from the river Petterel through 
the town of Penrith, to the great benefit of the inhabitants. He likewife 
founded a chantry in the church of St. Andrew in Penrith. 

After he had prefided here 20 years, he died Aug. 30, 1419; and lies 
buried in the north ifle of the cathedral, under his portraiture elegantly cut 
in plain ftone. 

17. Roger Whelpdale, born in Cumberland at or near Grayftock, was 
firft fent to Baliol college in Oxford, where he was fometime fellow; from 
thence he was tranfplanted into a fellowfhip of Queen's college in the fame 
univerfity, where he was chofen provoil. Having firft obtained the pope's 
provifion in his favour, he had the king's licence to the chapter of Carlifle to 
elect him, dated at Maule in Normandy Oct. 12, 1419, in the fame form as 
at this day;j\ After his election, he was confecrated at London by the 
bifhop of Winchefter and others, and had reftitution of the temporalties 
the 1 2th day of March following. 

He died on the 4th of February 1422, at Carlifle place in London. And 
having made his will Jan. 22. preceding, he therein ordered his body to be 
buried in the church of St. Paul London in the porch or fome other private 
place. He gave books, veftments, and 10/ in money to the faid Queen's 
college ; alfo books to Baliol college ; and to the fcholars of the univerfity 
20/. He alfo bequeathed 200/ for the founding and endowing a chantry 
within the cathedral of Carlifle (as is aforefaid) for Sir Thomas Skelton knight 
and Mr. John Glafton both of this diocefe, and (as may be fuppofed) his par- 
ticular friends. He placed a cheft in Queen's college (as Anthony a- Wood 
fays) wherein he deposited the fum of 36/ 13 s \d as a ftock to be increafed 
by the liberality cf other benefactors. 

Pits and Bale (who fcldom agree in the characters they give of any ptrrfon)

In 1429, bilhop Barrow was one of thofe Englifh prelates who proteftet* 
againft the great cardinal Beaufort's appearing at Wmdfor on St. George's 
day, as prelate of the garter in right of his bifhoprick of Winchester-}-, 

in July following, the faid bifhop was one of the king's commifTioners 
(together with the earls of Northumberland and Salifbury) for the truce con- 
cluded with Scotland at Hawden Stank f . 

This bifhop died at Rofe Caftle, 4 Sept. 1429 â€¢, and was buried in St. Ca 
tharine's chapel on the fouth fide of his own cathedral. 

19. Marmaduke Lumley, of the noble family of the barons Lumley in 
the palatinate of Durham, was upon bifhop Barrow's death elected by the 
chapter and confirmed by the king, and yet was not to have restitution of the 
temporaries till the pope's confent was obtained, as appears by the writ itfeif 
dated at Canterbury the 15th day of April 143 1. 

In the fame year, upon allegation by the king's ferjeants and attorney gene- 
ral, that fuch archbifhops and bifhops of England as had heretofore accepted 
of the cardinals hat were thereupon deprived of their prelacies here, and praying 
that the like judgment might be given for the king in the prefent cafe of 
Henry Beaufort bifhop of Winchester ; the bifhops and other lords of parlia- 
ment unanimoufly agreed, that the ancient rights of the crown in this cafe 
ought to be maintained and preferved : but forafmuch as the faid cardinal was 
nearly related to his majefty, that the cardinal fhould be fairly heard ; and 
that till this could be done, fearch fhould be made in the records of the king- 
dom. The difTent of the bifhop of Carlifle is entered on the foot of the 
record thus : The bifhop of Carlifle differed in his anfvver from the reft, and 
held, that until the coming of the cardinal nothing at all ought to be done 
in the affair. 

In 1433, upon his being licenfed, with many other Englifh bifhops to the 
general - council at Bafil, he is thus varioufiy defcribed in the record, â€¢' Mar- 
4u maduke bifhop of Carlifle, otherwife called Marmaduke Lumley bifhop of 
" Carlifle, otherwife called Marmaduke bifhop of Carlifle late parfon of the 
*' church of Stephenhithe in the county of Middlefex, otherwife called 
" Marmaduke bilhop of Carlifle executor of the teftamtnt of John Lum- 
" ley knight J." 

In 1435, the bifhops of Durham and Carlifle, with other lords temporal, 
are commiffioned to treat with the commiffioners of the king of Scots*. 

This bifhop, great and noble as he was, found fome difficulties, through 
the great loffcs he fuftained by the daily incurfions of the Scots, in raifing 
funds fufficient for the fupporc of his epifcopal dignity ; and therefore upon 
application to the throne he had a royal grant of the churches of Caldbeck 
and Rothbury 10 be annexed to his fee for ever, bearing date June 21, 144X ||.

But neither of thefe appropriations took place, and the two churches ftill con- 
tinue re&orial. 

In the year 1449, he was tranflated to Lincoln. 

20. Nicholas Close, archdeacon of Colchefter, and one of the king's 
chaplains, was called by the pope's provifion to this fee in 1449,. and 
had reftitution of the temporalties in the ufual form on the 14th of March 
following. 

The occafion of his being advanced to this bifhoprick was probably the 
good fervices he had done the year before in a treaty of peace concluded with 
ihe king of Scots, he being one of the commiflloners (together with the lord 
privy feal, lord treafurer, and lord comptroller of the houfehold, and others) 
in the faid treaty, by the name and designation of Nicholas Cloos chancellor 
of the univerfity of Cambridge, and doctor of divinity 4-. 

In 145 1, Nicholas bifhop of Carlifle, with Robert bifhop of Durham, and 
others, were commiflioned to infpect the confervators of the truce and wardens 
of the marches, and to punifh their negligence and irregularities -J-. 

In 1452, the bilhop of Carlifle, with the earls of Salifbury and Northum- 
berland, and others, were commiflioned to take the homage of James earl 
of Douglas and all other Scottifh noblemen who mould apply for that 
purpofeÂ§. 

On the 30th of Augufl in the fame year, he was tranflated by the pope to 
Litchfield, made his profeflion at Lambeth on the 15th of October, and died 
before the firft of November following J. 

21. William Percy, fon to the earl of Northumberland, and fometime 
chancellor of the univerfity of Cambridge, bringing the now ufual provifionary 
bulls from Rome, had the temporalties of the vacant fee given him by king 
Henry the fixth, on the 24th of October 1452. 

[It is here obfervable, to what an exorbitant height the papal power was at 
this time advanced. Acts of parliament were made, and then in full force, 
that if any refervation, collation, or provision fhall be made by the court of 
Rome, of any archbifhoprick, bifhoprick, dignity, or other benefice, the 
king {hall prefent for that time ; and if the king's prefentee be difturbed by 
fuch provifors, the difturber (hall be imprifoned till he make fatisfaction.â€” â€” 
And if any ihall go or fend out of the realm to provide for himfelf a bene- 
fice-, he fhall be out of the king's protection, and the benefice (hall be void. â€” 
And if any fhall accept fuch benefice, he fhall be banifhed out of the realm 
for ever, and his lands and goods forfeited to the king. And notwithstanding 
al! this, the contrary was in conftant practice : So weak was the executive 
power, and fo prevalent the hierarchy at that time.] 

in 1462, this bilhop Percy died. Upon whole death king Edward the 
fourth granted the profits of the bifhoprick during the vacancy to Dr. John

faid John Kingfcott by the king's father, which the king acknowledged as his 
own debt : And foon after, he was promoted to the biihoprick. 

22. John Kingscott. Whatever influence his being a creditor of the 
king might have upon the election, it is certain he was chofen by the chapter, 
and approved by the pope; and had thereon reltitution (or rather continuance) 
of the temporalties from the king on the 20th of October 1462, before it was 
poffible for him to have reimburfed himfelf of the 600/ debt. And he died 
in little more than a year after. For on the 16th of Dec. 1463, the faid king 
Edward the fourth, then refiding at Pontefraft, granted the temporalties 
of the bifhoprick of CarliQe, vacant by the death of mafter John Kingfcott 
late bimop there, to Richard Nevil earl of Warwick aad Salifbury-f. 

23. Richard Scroop. The pope upon the death of bifnop Kingfcott, who 
hardly enjoyed the bifhoprick fo long as to have all his fcores paid off, provided 
mafter Richard Scrope (elect of the fame church, fays the record) to fucceed, 
and he had the temporalties reftored on the 5th of June 1464. The provi- 
fion, if it may be fo called, was from the famous iEneas Sylvius, pope Pius 
the fecond, in the latter end of the year 1463 ; and he fent a recommendation 
of him to the clergy and others of the diocefe of Carlifle, as followeth : 
" Pius epifcopus, fervus fervorum Dei, dilectis filiis in populo civitatis et 
dioces' ecclefis Karliol', falutem et apoftolicam benedictionem. Hodie eccle- 
fiae Karliolenfi, per obitum bonse memorise Johannis epifcopi Karliolenfis extra

Bifhop Scroop died May 16, 1468. 

24. Edward Story, being elected by the chapter, and approved by the 
pope, had reftitution of the temporalties Sept, 1, 1468. 

In 1471, there is a confirmation of the vicarages of Bampton, Shap and 
Warcop, granted by him to the abbey of Shap.

took an oach of fealty to Edward the fifth then prince of Wales. And in the 
following month, he with the bifhop of Durham and the earl of Northumber- 
land and others was a commifTioner appointed to treat with thofe of Scotland 
at Alnwick ; and the year following at Newcallle â€¢, and in 1473 at cither of 
the former, or indefinitely at any other place : And in 1474, in the treaty of 
marriage betwixt the prince of Scotland and the princefs Cecily king Edward 
the fourth's fecond daughter-]-. 

In 1477, ne was translated to Chichefter. Archdeacon Bowchier, in his 
aforefaid letter to bifhop Nicolfon, fays, As for bifhop Story, I perfuade my- 
felf, that he left fome remembrance and considerable benefaction either to the 
fee, church, or city of Carlifie : Otherwife it is the only place to which he 
had any relation, whereunto he was not a benefactor. Pie gave to Pembroke 
hall a good eftate â€¢, was benefactor to the church of Ely â€¢, founded the free 
fchool at Chichefter, and built the new crofs in the market place there, leaving 
a good eftate to the corporation for its conftant repair ; bellowed lands on his 
fee, and alio on the dean and chapter. 1 find by bifhop Wren's account or 
hiftory of the fellows of Pembroke hall, that Edward Story was a north- 
country man, but the place is not fet down. Where and when he took his 
ieveral orders, what preferments he had in the church before he was bifhop, 
1 have no where found. He lies buried at Chichefter, under a tomb which he 
built in his life time. He died Jan. 29, 1502. 

Probably this bifhop might be defcended of fome of the many families, on 
the borders, in Cumberland, that ftill bear this name. 

25. Richard Bell, prior of Durham, was by the pope's command made 
bifliop, confecrated by his predeceffor, and had the temporalties reftored to 
him 24 Apr. T478. 

Before he was bifhop, he had been feveral times one of king Edward the 
fourth's commiffioners in treaties with thofe of the king of Scots. 

He built the tower at Rofe, which ftill bears the name of Bell's tower. 

He died in 1496, and was buried in his own cathedral, under the Litany 
defk, where is his portraiture in his pontificals, drawn at full length. On a brafs 
plate are fome rude latin verfes â€¢, and on a brafs margin about the ftone,

York, and created bifhop of Carlifie in 1496. His temporalties were given

In 1497, William bifhop of Carlifle, Sir Thomas Dacre of Dacre, and 
William Warham mafter of the Rolls (afterwards arch bifhop of Canterbury) 
were the king's plenipotentiaries in a general treaty with the foid James king

In 1502, this bifhop was tranflated to Durham by the pope's bull -f-j-. 

27. Roger Leyburn was defcended from an ancient fami'y of that mm? 
in Weftmorland, was educated at Cambridge, mafter of Pembroke hall there, 
and archdeacon and chancellor of Durham. He was confecrated Sep*:. 1. 1503, 
and the temporalties were reflored to him Oct. 15 following -f-. 

His will bears date July 17, 1507 ; wherein he defires to be bu ied in St. 
James's hofpital near unto Charing Crofs by London; but whether he died 
in that or in the year following is not certain. Walter Redman, doctor in 
divinity, and mafter of the college at Gray flock, was one of his executors Â§. 

28. John Penny, LL. D. educated in Lincoln college in Oxford, abbot 
of Leicefter, and afterwards bifhop of Bangor. The pope's bull for the 
tranflation of bifhop Penny from Bangor to Carlifle is dated at Rome on the 
21ft of September 150!) ; and on the 23d of January following he paid his 
obedience to the archbifhop of YorkÂ§.

29. John Kytf. He was born, as it is faid, within the city of London, 
and was educated for a time in the univerfity : But in what houfe, or what 
degrees he took, appears not. Afterwards he had feverai dignities conferred 
on him, being fubdean of the king's chapel, and by Hen. 7. lent anibaffador 
into Spain. In the latter end of 1513 he was made archbifhop of Armagh 
by provifion from pope Leo the 10th, and had the temporalties thereof on the 
23th of May in the year following i|. 

On the third of Auguft 1521, being newly made bifhop of Carlifle, he re- 
figned the archbifhoprick of Armagh, and was made archbifhop of Thebes 
in Greece. Thefe things were done through endeavours made to the pope by 
cardinal Wolfcy, whofe creature Kyte was. The fees of the tranflation, with 
the commendams for Carlifle and his other benefices amounted to 1790 ducats ;

In 1524, bifhop Kyte was one of king Henry the eighth's commiflioner* 
(jointly with Thomas duke of Norfolk and Thomas lord Dacre) to treat with 
the commiffioners of the king of Scots for abftinence from war + 

In 1526, he was a plenipotentiary, with Ralph earl of Weftmorland and 
others, in a treaty of perpetual peace and amity with James the fifth, king 
of Scots 4- 

In S529, he was one of the bifhops who figned an inftrument approving the 
reafonablenefs of the king's fcruples concerning his marriage, and advifing re- 
courfe to the pope for a fpeedy dccifion of the caufe;{\ 

This bifhop Kyte, after he came to the fee of Carlifle, was an intimate 
acquaintance of cardinal Wolfey, who converfed freely with him in his 
profperity, and applied to him for neceffaries ^as a faithful friend) in his 
adverfity *. 

In 1530, he was one of the four bifhops, who with cardinal Wolfey, arch- 
bifhop Warham, and the whole peerage of England, figned the bold letter to 
pope Clement the feventh in the cafe of the king's divorce-f-f-.

30. Robert Aldridge, was born at Burnham in Buckinghamshire, and 
educated at Eaton, whence in 1507 he was chofen fcholar of king's college in 
Cambridge. Here he proceeded in arts-, about which time, Erafmus in one 
cf his epiftles gives him the title of bland* eloquently juvenis. Afterwards he 
was proctor of the univerfuy of Cambridge -, and then fchoolmafter, fellow, 
and provoft of Eaton. In 1529, he was incorporated bachelor in divinity at 
Oxford, and the year following commenced doctor there in the fame faculty. 
About this time he was made archdeacon of Colchefter, and in 1537 was in- 
Hailed canon of Windfor, and the fame year constituted regiftrary of the mod 
noble order of the garter. He was an eminent orator and poet, having left 
fome epigrams and other pieces in proof of his abilities that way. His friend 
John Leland (the antiquarian poet) has recommended him and his perform- 
ances to pofterity in his Encomia, &c. 4- 

In Henry the eighth's mandate for his confecration, Aug. 7, 1537, he is 
called chaplain and almoner of our beloved confort Jane queen of England. 
He had reftitution of his temporahies Aug. 24 Â§. 

He was one of thofe bifhops, who (with archbifhop Cranmer) fet out the 
godly and pious inftitution of a Chriftian man, commonly called The bifhops 
book f. 

About this time, the houfe at Lambeth Marfh, called Carlifle-houfe, for- 
merly the bifhop of Rochefter's, was given by king Hen. 8. to bifhop Ald- 
ridge and his fucceffors in exchange for his houfes near Ivie bridge, now Beau- 
fort's buildings, for which the duke of Beaufort pays a yearly quit rent of 16/ 
to the bifhop of Carlifle. 

In 1540, bifhop Aldridge was one of thofe eight bifhops whom king Henry 
the eighth conlulted (with other learned divines) about the doctrine of the 
feven facraments ; and the anfwers which he gives to all the feventeen feveral 
quseries thereupon feem to be as learned and as well confidered as any of the 
reft. In the main he adheres to the Roman profefiion of faith in thefe parti- 
culars, and difagrees with archbifhop Cranmer and fome other favourers of the 
reformation Â£.

parliament, againft the contrary endeavours of archbifhop Cranmer and molt 
of his fuffragans ||. 

In 1547, this diocefe, with the whole province of York, was vifited by 
Edward the fixth's commiffioners ; who firft adminiftred the oath of fupremacy 
to each bifhop, and then gave him the king's injunctions. 

In 1555, this bithop died at Horncaftle, and (as is fuppofed) was buried 
there. Anthony a-'Wood obferves of him, that he lived during the time that 
many and great changes were made both in church and ftate-, that he held 
his preferments during all thofe changes, and confequently complied with all. 

31. Owen Oglethorp. He was born at Newton Kyme, a little village 
near Tadcafter in the county of York; was educated at Magdalen college in 
Oxford-, and was proctor of the univerfity in 1531. Soon after this, viz, in 
1535, being then bachelor of divinity, he was chofen prefident of his college; 
and vicechancellor in 1 55 1 . The year following he quitted his headfhip for 
a canonry in king Henry the eighth's new erected college, and forthwith from 
a canon he wasinfhlled dean of the royal chapel of Windfor. And in the firft 
year of queen Mary he was chofen fecretary of the order of the garter. In the 
fame year he was re-elecled prefident of Magdalen college, being at the fame 
time rector of Newington and Hafely both in the county of Oxford, as well as 
dean of Windfor. In 1554 he was one of the Oxford doctors, appointed to 
difpute with Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer-, and on the 7th of April 1555 
he finally refigned his prefidentfhip, being then within view of the bifhoprick 
of Car'lifle Â§ 

On the 27th of October 1556, the cuftody of the temporalties of the bi- 
fhoprick of Carlifle w r as granted to the faid Owen Oglethorp being then bifhop 
elect ; and on the 2-8 th of January following as foon as the pope's confirmatory 
bull was arrived, the faid temporalties were fully reltored to him in the ufual 
form i. 

In 1558, when Heath archbifhop of York, and all the reft of the bifhops, 
refufed to crown queen Elizabeth (the fee of Canterbury being then voidj, 
bifhop Oglethorp was with much ado prevailed upon to fet the crown on her 
head. For which fact, when he faw the iffue of the matter, and both himielf 
(faith Anthony a- Wood) and all the reft of his facred order deprived, and the 
church's holy laws and faith againft the conditions of her confecration and 
acception into that royal office violated, he fore repented him all the days of 
his 1 fe, which were for that ipecial caufe both fhoi t and wearifome *. When 
he was appointed to execute the folemnity of the queen's coronation, the lords

to obey Â£. 

In the queen's firft parliament this year, he was prefent and gave his diffent 
to the bills for reftitution of firft fruits, for reftoring the fupremacy, for ex- 
change of bifhops knds, and for the uniformity of common prayer ||. 

I' 1 l 559-> May 11, he was fined by the queen's council 250/, for his con- 
tempt amongft others of her majefty's command to appear at a public difput- 
ation on the challenge of Jewell. And he was not long after deprived of his 
bifhoprick ; the reputed value whereof at that time was 268/Â§. 

He died of an apoplexy, and was buried privately, with fix efcutcheons of 
arms, at St. Dunftan's in the Weft 4.. 

His will bears date Nov. 10. in the firft year of Elizabeth by the g r ace of 
God of England, France, and Ireland, queen. (So that thereby it appeared* 
that he owned her title.) Jn purfuance of a royal licence in the 4 and 5 Ph. 
and M. referred to in his faid will, he injoins his executors, viz. Andrew Ogle- 
thorp his brother, Clement Oglcthorp his nephew, Richard Shipley his brother, 
his coufin Robert Oglethorp, and Robert Thurlby his fi-rvant, that for the en- 
dowment of the grammar fchool at Tadcafter, and for the erecting and endow- 
ing of an hofpital or an almfhoufe there for twelve poor people, with fo many 
diftinft lodgings, a common kitchen, and an hall to dine in, to be built in the 
form of a quadrangle, with a fair door into the church yard, and a fair image 
of Chrift (landing on the top of the door, and to be called Chad's hofpital, 
they fhould within a convenient time after his deceafe purchafe lands of the clear 
yearly value of 40/ over and befides all charges, of which the manor of Cob- 
croft purchafed by the teftator and given to the fchoolmafter fhould be part, for 
the ufe of the faid fchool and hofpital for ever : And that of this 40 / per annum 
fo much as fhould make the manor of Cobcroft 40 marks per annum mould be 
afligned to the fchoolmafter as his falary, and the refidue to the faid twelve poor 
people and their fucceffors, who were to have \id each weekly for their lives, 
if the rents fhould be able to anfwer the charge ; if not, thrn power is given 
to his executors or fupervifors to diminifh the number of the poor people as 
they fall vacant, 6, 8, or io. And for the making this purchafe, and build- 
ing the hofpital, he gives in p'ate and money the fimi of 600/, and the rent of 
Snedal in the county of York, or fo much yearly rent as that of Snedal amounts 
to, to be affigned and afTufed to this ufe by his brother Andrew Oglethorp, 
which the teftator had purchafed with his own money of Sir Arthur Darcy. 

1 his is the fubftance of the will fo far as it relates to the fchool and hofpital. 
And archdeacon Pearfon, in his letter of May 9, 1709, to bilhop Nicolfon, 
fays, " The fchoolmafter's falary is ftill about 40 marks-, but as to the hofpital, 
it was not built according to the direction of the charitable founder, and is now

After the death of bifhop Ogle thorp, Mr. Bernard Gilpin, rector of Hougton 
in the Spring, in the county of Durham, and commonly known by the name 
of the northern apoftle, had upon the requeft of his kinfman Edwin Sandys 
then bifhop of Worcefter a Conge d'Eflire fent to him to be elected into the 
vacant bifhoprick, but he abfolutely refufed it. 

32. John Best. He was a Yorkfhireman born; bred in the univerfity of 
Oxford; and afterwards dignified in the church of Weils and elfewhere-, but 
leaving all in the beginning of queen Mary's reign for religion's fake, he lived 
obfcurely and as occafion ferved *. 

He was confecrated bifhop on the 2d of March 1560, aged 48 years; and 
had his temporalties from the queen on the 18th of April following f . 

In 1564, he had the queen's commifiion procured by fccrerary Cecil, at the 
interceffion of Edmund Grindal bifhop of London, to arm him againft the ill 
dealings of papifts and other difaffecled perfons in his diocefr J. 

In 1566, he was one of the five bifhops created doctors in divinity at Lon- 
don by Dr. Humphrey the queen's profeffor at Oxford, by virtue of a fpecial 
commiflion from the univerfity for that purpofe||. 

The fame year he was one of the 13 bifhops, who together with the two 
archbifhops, fubfcribed the Saxon homilies, then published by archbifhop 
Parker in confutation of the errors of the church of Rome Â§. 

In 1567, Ap. 9. he wrote to archbifhop Parker the following letter :â€” â€” 
<* I have a commendam of a parith called Rumald Church. It will expire 
â– within a year or lefs. The advowfon of the fame is offered to be fold to gentle- 
men of this country at unreafonable fums of money. So that it is apparent the 
revenues thereof are like to come into the temporal mens hands, and the cure 
into fome unlearned afs's, as many others are like to do in thefe parts, unlefs 
your grace be a good ftay therein. For this caufe, and for that my charge 
here in the queen's fervice doth daily increafe, and alfo that in time of wars I 
have no refuge left to fly unto but only this, I am compelled to be a fuitor to 
your grace, for the renewing of my commendam for the time of my life. In 
doino- whereof, your grace fhall both ftay the covetous gripe that hath the advow- 
fon from his prey, the unlearned afs from the cure, where I have now a learned 
preacher, and bind me as I am otherwife moft bound to ferve and pray for your 
grace's long continuance in honour and godlinefs ; your grace's poor brother to

25. Richard Barnhs. He was bred in Brazen-Nofe college in Oxford, 
whereof in 1553 he proceeded bachelor of arts, and in 1556 was admitted 
mailer. He afterwards took his bachelor of divinity's degree in Cambridge. 
He was born at Bould near Warrington in Lancashire, and was admitted fel- 
low of Brazen-Nofe by authority of the king's council in 1552. About the 
time (hat he took the degree of mafter of arts, he alio took holy orders, and 
was made minifier of Stonegrave in Yorkfhire. In 1561 he was admitted 
chancellor of the cathedral church of York, and about the fame time was 
made canon residentiary and prebendary of Laughton in the faid church, as 
alb public reader of Divinity therein. About 1567, he was confecrated fuf- 
fragan bifhop of Nottingham in the church of St. Peter at York f. 

On the 25th of June 1570, he was elected bifhop of Carlifle, had his elec- 
tion confirmed on the 13th of July following, and had the temporalties reflored 
on the 26th of the fame month Â£. 

He was allowed to hold his chancellor's flail and dignity in the metropolitical 
church of York in commendam with the bifhoprick of Carlifle for one year 
after his confecration, and the rectories of Scockeflay and Stonegrave during 
his life, provided that as foon as he fhould be polTefTed of the church of Rum- 
bold kirk, the rectory of Stockeflay fhould become vacant }|. 

In 1577, he was elected to the fee of Durham, and confirmed the 9th of 
May in that year: and in 1579 was creacec ^ doctor of divinity at Oxford. He 
died in 15S7, and was buried in the choir, fometimes called the Prefbytaries, 
of the cathedral church of Durham. Over his grave was a monument foon 
after put, with this infcription thereon :

34. John Meye. He was in 1560 chofen marter of Catherine hall, and 
Mr. Strype fuppofes was brother to William Meye dean of St. Paul's. In 
1570, he was vice-chancellor of Cambridge, and procured for the univerfity a 
new body of ftatutes. In 1575, he was made archdeacon of the Eaft Riding 
in Yorkfhire. 

In 1577, June 12, he was chofen bifhop of Carlifle; was confecrated at 
London on the 29th of September following, and had reftitution of the tem- 
poralties on the 8th of October. 

Mr. Strype tells us, that this Dr. Meye was made bifhop by the intercefilon 
of his friend the earl of Shrewfbury, which favour he acknowledged by a letter 
dated from Huntingdon, where (inter alia) he requefts the faid earl to obtain 
a commendam for him where he might refide, Rofe caftle being then taken up 
by a temporal lord, the lord Scrope-, therefore he befought him to move the 
earl of Leicefter for his commendam, viz. the benefice of Darfield. â€” Lord 
Scrope was at that time warden of the weft marches, and might upon that ac- 
count borrow Rofe caftle to refide in for a time, but had certainly no other 
claim to it. And what the bifhop fays of him was a mere pretext to obtain a

commendam for Darfield. And Dr. Todd fays, he attempted to have had 
fome concurrent leafes of good value given in reverfion to fome of his near 
relations, but the dean and chapter refufed to confirm them. 

This bifhop died at Rofe caftle on the 15th of February 1597 at eight in 
the morning, and was buried at Carlifle at eight in the evening of the fame 
day ; the plague raging at that time, of which diftemper probably he died. 

35. Henry Robinson. He was born within the city of Carlifle, and 
was entred upon the foundation of Queen's college in Oxford about the year 
1568, where he became fellow, and was efteemed an excellent difputant and 
preacher. In 1576, being then only matter of arts, he was chofen principal of 
Edmund hall ; nor had he taken any other degree, when in 1581 he was unani- 
moufly elected provoft of the faid Queen's college ; which office he enjoyed' 
about 18 years, and in that time restored the college and made it flourifh, after- 
it had been long in a declining condition through the negligence of former go- 
vernors. 

In 1583, archbifhop Grindall by his laft will and teftament bequeathed to. 
his chaplain Henry Robinfon (then provoft of Queen's) the advowfon of a 
dignity and prebend in the church of Litchfield, or of another in that of St-.. 
David's. 

In 1590, he commenced doctor in divinity. 

In 1598, May 27, he was elected bifhop of Carlifle-, confecrated July 23 ; 
and had his temporalties reftored Aug. 5. 

In i599> he was appointed one of the queen's commiffioners for ecclefiaftical 
caufes. 

In 1613, George Denton of Cardew-hall within the manor of Dalfton efquire, 
refufing all fuic to his lordfhip's mills and courts, the bifhop filed a bill againfc 
him in the exchequer and obtained a decree againft him, and thereby fecured 
the juft rights of his fee againft that mefne lordfhip. 

From an entry in the Regifter of the parifh of Dalfton it appears, that this 
bifhop died at Rofe the 19th day of June 1616, about three of the clock in 
the afternoon, and was buried in the cathedral church of Carlifle about eleven 
of the clock of the night of the fame day. 

On a plate of brafs, behind the hangings on the north corner of the high 
altar in the cathedral, was a draught of a bifhop in his pontificals, kneeling 
before one church in ruins, and another fair built. Upon the former whereof

tober following J. 

He died in the year 1624, and left money (as it is faid) for the endowing 
of a fchool and building of an hofpital, which bifhop Godwin fays was 300/

preached at a metropolitical vifitation Sept. 7, 1607, when he was minifter at, 
Sevenoake ||.

bridge, and afterwards removed to that of St. John's in the fame univerfity, of 
which he was made fellow; and continuing there many years, took the degree, 
of doctor of divinity in 1622. He was firft chaplain, as it is faid, in the earl 
of Bedford's family ; afterwards to prince Charles, and at length to king James,

39. Francis White, D. D. was confecrated at London, Dec. 3, 1626. 
Dr. Heylin fays of him, that he was a man who having fpent the greaieft part 
of his life on his own private cures, grew fuddenly into efteem by his zealous 
preaching againftthe papifts, and his book againft thejefuit Fifher. 

He was appointed by king James the firft to have a fpecial eye to the coun- 
ters of Denbigh, whom the priefts much laboured to pervert. He was en- 
couraged thereco by the deanry of Carlifle, and advanced on the fame account 
to the bifhoprick thereof in the year 1626. 

On the 9th of February 162.3, he was tranflated to Norwich. In the heads 
and articles to be infilled on in an intended declaration of the houfe of com- 
mons, and agreed upon in a fubcommittee for religion the 25th of Feb. 1628, 
complaint was made of the growth of Arminianiim, and that thole perfons 
who maintained and publifhed that fort of doctrine were favoured and pre- 
ferred. One inftance (amongft others) of this was in the late bifhop of Car- 
lifle, who fince his laft Arminian fermon on Chriftmafs-day foregoing preached 
at court, was- advanced to the bifhoprick of Norwich. 

On the 8th of December 163 1 he was tranflated to Ely, and died in his

educated in the college at Dublin. In 1620 he was promoted to the bi- 
(hoprick of Meath, and upon Dr. Chriftopher Hampton's death in 1624 he 
was advanced to the archbifhoprick of Armagh. The troubles coming on af- 
terwards in that kingdom, he fuffered great loffes thereby â€¢, in consideration 
whereof king Charles the firft, in the year 1641, granted him the bifhoprick 
of Carlifle in commendam ; upon the revenues of which bifhoprick, though 
much diminifhed by the quartering of the Englifh and Scotch armies, he made 
fhift to fupport himfelf, till the parliament feized on all bifhops lands; and 
then, in confideration of his great merits they allowed him a penfion of 400/, 
but he never received it above once, or twice at mod 4-.

He died on Friday the 21ft of March 1655 at the countefs of Peterbo- 
rough's houfe at .Rygajte in Surry, aged y$ years. Sir Timothy Tyrrel, his 
ibn-in-law, and the countefs of Peterborough, had refolved to bury him in a 
decent manner, but without pomp, at Rygate, in the vault of the Howards, 
of which family the countefs was*. But Oliver Cromwell ordered him to be 
interred with great magnificence in Weftminfter abbey, and figned a warrant 
to the lords of the treafury to pay to Dr. Bernard 200 / to defray the expence 
thereof. And this Cromwell did out of an honourable refpe<5t to the memory 
of fo pious and learned a champion of the protectant caufe as the archbifhop 
was. On Thurfday the 17th of April following, his body was conveyed from 
Rygate to St. George's church in Southwark â€¢, at which place, about 12 of the 
clock, his friends and many of the clergy met the corps, and accompanied 
ic from thence to Somerfet houfe, where lying for fome time, it was from 
thence carried to Weftminfter abbey : Where, after the faid Dr. Bernard had 
preached to a numerous auditory, it was interred. 

Cromwell injoined the archbifhop's executors not to fell his library without 
Cromwell's confent. Part of ic was purchafed by the officers and foldiers of 
the then army in Ireland; and many of the books and more of the beft ma- 
nufcripts had been ftolen or imbezzled during the times of confufion. What 
remained was by king Charles the fecond given to the college at Dublin, and 
is ft ill a confiderable part cf the library there. 

42. Richard Sterne, upon the reftoration of king Charles the fecond, was 
nominared to this fee. He was fon of Simon Sterne of Mansfield in the 
county of Nottingham, defcended from thofe of his name in Suffolk, and was 
educated in the univerfity of Cambridge, where he became doctor of Divinity, 
and was matter of Jefus college. He was alfo chaplain to archbifhop Laud, 
whom he attended on the fcaffold whereon that primate was beheaded. He 
himfelf was alfo a prifoner in the Tower with fome other heads of houfes, 
upon a complaint from Oliver Cromwell then burgefs for Cambridge, for con- 
veying their college plate to the king at York. Hereupon he was ejecled 
out of his mafterlhip, and lofing all he had, lived obfeurely till the re-- 
ftoration *. 

This bifhop built a chapel at Rofe, and arching it underneath, the walls 
were infufEcient to fuftain the weight, and thereby it became fo ruinous, that 
his next fucceflbr was obliged to take it down and rebuild it. 

In 1664 he was tranflated to York, and died there on the 18th of June 
1683. Bifhop Burnet, in the Hiftory of his own Times, fays of him, that he 
was a four, ill-tempered man, and minded chiefly the inriching his family : 
That he was fufpected of popery, becaufe he was more than ordinarily com-

pliant in all things to the court, and was very zealous for the duke of York. 
On the contrary, in a letter from York to his fucceffor at Carlifle, bifhop Rain- 
bow, it is faid, " He was greatly refpected and generally lamented. All the 
" clergy commemorate his fweet condefcenfions, his free communications, 
" faithful counfels, exemplary temperance, chearful liofpitality, and bounti- 
'* ful charity. He contributed largely to St. Paul's. Nor did he forget St. 
'.' Peter's ; for by his will he bequeathed to our cathedral at York all his chapel 
" plate, to repair the lofs of our own, by facrilegious hands not long fince 
' ftolen out of our veftry. He carefully provided for all his family, even to 
the meaneft fervant. He was very exacl in every thing he meddled with 
and had time to difpatch, and I wifh that his Hebrew criticifms upon the 
facred text do not want his laft hand. In his Logic (which is ready for the 
prefs) I defired him not to omit the inftances which (for illuftration) he 
** had made out of the bible : He told me, that it was like to come into the 
" hands of boys, that might not ufe it with that reverence which was meet. 
" But I hope that what I replied prevailed with him to retain them." 

His will was, to go quietly to the grave, without exenteration, lying in 
ftate, or funeral fermon. He regarded not pomp whilft he lived, and he pro- 
vided againft all indications of it when he was dead. He was buried under a 
noble monument in St. Stephen's chapel at the eaft end of the cathedra', on 
which is the following inicription :

43. Edward Rainbow was born at Bliton near Gainfborough in the county 
of Lincoln, on the 20th of April 1608, his father Mr. Thomas Rainbow be- 
ing then minifter there. After he had been educated in the fchools of Gainf- 
borough, Peterborough, and Weftminfter, he was admitted in Corpus Chrifti 
college in Oxford in July 1623, his elder brother John being then fellow of 
that houfe. But within lefs than two years, he removed thence to Magdalen 
college in Cambridge, where he was fcholar, fellow, and an eminent tutor, 
and as fuch the two fons of the right honourable Theophilus earl of Suffolk 
were committed to his care, as were alfo two fons of the lord Daincourt. In 
October 1642, he was admitted to the mafterfhip of the faid laft named college. 
In 1646, he commenced doctor in divinity. He loft his faid mafterfhip in 
1650, for refufing to fign a proteltation againft the king. In 1652, he had 
the living of Chefterford near Audley Inn in Effex, and in the fame year mar- 
ried Mrs. Elizabeth Smith his predecefTor's daughter. In 1659, t ^ ie ricn rec - 
tory of Benefield in Nonhamptonfhire was given him by the earl of Warwick; 
and by the favour of lord Broghill he was excufed from going to the triers, a 
thing he never would fubmit to for any preferment whatever. Soon after the 
reftoration of king Charles the fecond he was reltored to his mafterfhip of 
Magdalen college, and made dean of Peterborough. In 1662 he was made 
vicechancellor of the univerfity of Cambridge, and in 1664 bifhop of Carlifle, 
to which he was confecrated by archbifhop Sheldon in the chapel at Lambeth 
on the 10th of July in that year, and in September following he fettled at 
Rofe caftle, the only remaining habitable houle then belonging to the fee ; 
and finding even this in a molt miferable condition, a great part of it having 
been burnt by the Scots in the late rebellion, and the chapel (which was the 
only repair bifhop Sterne pretended to, notwithstanding what is faid in the 
flattering epitaph above mentioned, although he had received the immenfe ad- 
vantages of coming to the fee when all the kafes were either totally or near 
expired) yet being fo ill done that it was neceffary to take it entirely down, the 
bifhop thought it expedient to proceed againft his metropolitan and immediate 
predecefTor for dilapidations. Whereupon the archbifhop made a tender of 
400/ for repairing the chapel, and pleaded the act of indemnity and oblivion 
(12 Car. 2. c. 12.) in bar of all other dilapidations. The court of delegates 
adjudged the faid tender fufficient for repairing the faid chapel, and that all 
the other dilapidations were covered by the faid act, and fo difmified the caufe 
without cofts on either fide. The bifhop being thus totally defeated of all aid 
from his rich predecefTor (the cxpences of the taw-fuit having coft him more 
than 400/j let about the'repairs himfelf with all poffibie care and expedition; 
built the chapel; with the two good parlours below, entirely anew, as alio the 
ftair-cafe, and pafTage or entry wherein it ftands, with feveral other additions 
1 and 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 291 

and conveniencies, which all together coft riim upwards of 1 100/ (over and 
above the 400/ recovered for dilapidations). 

In 1667, he gave 130/ for augmenting the vicarage of Melborn in Derby- 
fhire ; which was to advance it 10 / per annum at the prefent, and 20 1 per an- 
num after the life of lady Hartop. 

He died at Rofe caftle on Wednefday the 26th day of March 1684., at the 
age of near 76 years, and was interred on Tuefday following in Dalfton church- 
yard, under the fouthern wall of the chancel ; where, according to his own 
direction, a plain common freeftone is laid over his grave with this in- 
fcription :

He left no works in print, but three occafional fermons : 

The firft of which was preached at St. Paul's Crofs, Sept. 28, 1634, in- 
titled, Labour forbidden and commanded. 

The fecond was preached at the funeral of Sufannah countefs of Suffolk, 
13th May, 1649, on Eccl. vii. 1. 

The third was preached at the interment of Anne countefs dowager of Pem- 
broke, Dorfet, and Montgomery, at Appleby in Weftmorland, 14th Apr. 16; 6. 
on Prov. xiv. 1. 

44. Thomas Smith was born at Whitewall in the parifh of Afby in the 
county of Weftmorland. He was educated in the neighbouring free fchool of 
Appleby, and in the 16th year of his age was admitted in Queen's college in 
Oxford. 

After he had taken the degree of mafter of arts, and was preferred to a fel- 
lowship, he became a very eminent tutor, moft of the gentlemen of the col- 
lege being committed to his care. 

When king Charles the firft refided at Oxford, Mr. Smith was one of thofe 
who were appointed to preach before him at Chriftchurch, and before the par- 
liament at St. Mary's. 

When afterwards faction, and the fanatical and furious zeal of a new fet of 
vifitors, had rendred Oxford as uneafy to perfons of loyalty and generofity, as 
before it had been acceptable, he withdrew into the north; living there in 
great privacy, till upon the reftoration of king Charles the fecond, the king's 
pleafure was intimated to the univerfity, that there mould be a creation in all 
faculties of fuch as had fuffered for the royal caufe. Whereupon,- on the 2d 
of Auguft 1660, he was with many more of his fellow fufferers created ba- 
chelor of divinity, and on the nth of December following was diplomated 
doflor in the fame faculty. 

The king was alfo pleafed to make him a fharer with others of his royal 
bounty, in the difpofal of vacant benefices and dignities in the church, and 
to honour him with being one of the king's chaplains in ordinary. A prebend 
in the church at Carlifle was what he had firft given him, into which he was 
inftalled Nov. 14, 1660. At the fame time he had the offer of a good rectory 

P p 2 in 



292 CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 

in the king's difpofal ; the diftance whereof not fuiting his other circumftances, 
he declined it himfelf, and procured it for his friend. 

Within a few months after this, he was collated by bifhop Cnfins to a pre. 
bend in the church of Durham â€¢, where, looking upon himfelf as inverted 
with a preferment as agreeable as his modefly would give him leave to wifli 
for, he began immediately to repair his prebendal houle, fparing no coft to 
make it a dwelling fuitable to the honour and endowments of that cathedral. 

Upon the promotion of Dr. Carleton to the bifhoprick of Briftol in 1671, 
Dr. Smith had the deanry of Carlifle conferred upon him. The dean's houfe 
was left by his predeceffor in the fame ruinous condition the rebellious times 
had brought it into : But was now, moftly from the ground, rebuilt at his 
own great expence. The altar of the cathedral had his offering of a large fet 
of double gilt communion plate; and his praifes were addrelfed to God on an 
handfome new organ given by him to the quire. 

Upon the death of bifhop Rainbow, he was to his own great furprize, and 
no lefs fat isf act ion of the whole diocefe, recommended by king Charles to the 
chapter for their bifhop, and by them elected May 3, 1684. On the 29th of 
June following he was confecrated in St. Peter's church at York, and about 
the middle of July did his homage at Windfor and had reftitution of the tem- 
porakies of his fee. 

In 1698, his wife died at Rofe, and was buried in the cathedral at Carlifle a 
little below the rails of the communion table, and over her grave is a fair 
marble (tone, upon which is very well cut,

45. William Nicolson. He was born at Orton near Carlifle, where his 
father Mr. Jofeph Nicolfon formerly of Queen's college in Oxford was then 
redtor. In 1670, being then 15 years of age, he was admitted member of 
the faid college. 

In 167;, he was fent by Sir Jofeph Williamfon (fecretary of ftate) toLeip- 
fick, in order to get acquaintance with the high Dutch and other feptentrional 
languages. Here he tranflated an effay of Mr. Hook's towards a proof of the 
motion of the earth from the fun's parallax, out of Englifh into Latin, which 
was there printed by the profeffor who put him upon it. 

In 1679, he was elected and admitted fellow of the faid Queen's college, 
after a (hort tour into France in the fummer, having firft compleated his de- 
gree of mafler of arts. 

In 1680, he publifhed an account of the ftate of the kingdoms of Poland, 
Denmark, and Norway, as alfo of Iceland, in the firft volume of the Englifh 
Atlas-, whereof he afterwards compofed the fecond and third volumes (treat- 
ing of the empire of Germany) without any affiftance. The fame year he 
was fent by the vicechancellor to wait on George Lewis prince of Brunfwick-

294 CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 

Hanover at Tetfworth in his way to the univerfity, where the next day his 
highnefs was complimented with the degree of a doctor in the civil law. 

In 1 68 r, he was collated by bifhop Rainbow to a vacanr prebend in the 
cathedral church of Carlifle, and alfo into the vicarage of Torpenhow, and 
in the year following to the archdeaconry of Carlifle, vacant by the refignation 
of Mr. Thomas Mufgrave. 

In 1685, he wrote a letter to Mr. Obadiah Walker mailer of Univerfity 
college, concerning a Runic infcription at Bewcaflle in Cumberland, printed 
in the Philofophical T ran factions, Numb. 178. And likewife a lecter to 
Sir William Dugdale, concerning a Runic infcription on the font in the 
church of Bridekirk, dated at CarliQe Nov. 23, 1685, and printed in the 
fame Tranfaction. 

In 1696, he publifhed the firft part of his Englifh Historical Library : The 
next year he published the fecond part : And in 1699, the third and laft part. 
In 1702, he published one for Scotland â€¢, as he did likewife one for Ireland in 
1724. â€” Dr. Atterbury having reflected on fome parts of the Englifb Hiftori- 
cal Library, particularly relating to convocations, in his rights, powers, and 
privileges of an Englifh convocation ; the bifhop vindicated himfelf in a letter 
to Dr. White Kennet publilhed in the third edition of the faid Hiftorical 
Library. 

In 1702, on the eve of Afcenfion day, he was elected bifhop of Carlifle, 
confirmed June 3, and confecrated June 14 at Lambeth; which promotion 
was obtained by the intereft of the houfe of Edenhall. 

In 1704, Sept. 15. Dr. Francis Atterbury waited upon the bifhop at Rofe 
for inftitution to the deanry of Carlifle. But the letters patent being directed 
to the chapter and not to the bifhop, and the date thereof being July 15, 
though the late dean Doctor Grahme did not refign till the 5th of Auguit, 
and moreover fome difputes arifing about the regal fupremacy, inftitution was 
then refufed, but the bifhop declared at the fame time that the affair fhould be 
laid forthwith before the queen; and that if her majefty fhould, notwithftand- 
ing thefe objections, be pleafed to repeat her commands for giving Dr. Atter- 
bury poffefilon of the deanry, inftitution fhould be given. The queen was 
pleafed, by her principal fecretary of ftate, to intimate her pleafure to the bi- 
fhop to inftitute the dean, which was inftantly obeyed. 

In 1705, the bifhop publilhed 'his L.eges Marchiarum, or Border Laws, 
with a preface, and an Appendix of charters and records relating thereto. 

In 2707, Dr. Atterbury the dean, never at reft, and continually railing 
frefh difputes with his chapter, the bifhop endeavoured to appeafe ihem by 
vifiting the chapter, in purfuance of the power given by the ftatutes of king 
Hen. H. at the foundation of the corporation of dean and chapter. But Dr. 
Todd, one of the prebendaries, was iniligated by the dean, to proteft againft 
fuch vifitation, infilling upon the invalidity of king Henry the eighth's 
ftatutes, and that the queen, and not the bifhop, was the local vifitor. Dur- 
ing the courfe of the vifitation, the bifhop fufpended, and afterwards excom- 
municated Dr. Todd. Whereupon the doctor moved the court of common 
pleas for a prohibition, and obtained it unlefs caufe fhewn.

In the mean time thefe proceedings alarmed the archbifhops and bifhops, 
as the aforefaid objections ftruck at the root of all the new foundations of 
deans and chapters by king Henry the eighth ; and the archbifhop of Canter- 
bury writ the following circular letter to all his fufTragans : 

Right reverend Brother, 

Lambeth, 2 Feb 1707. 

I doubt not but all my fufTragans are apprifed of what is doing in the cafe 
of the bifhop of Carlifle. Though he is not of our province, I take it to be 
a common caufe, and of great concern to this church ; which will never be 
quiet, fo long as that evil generation of men, who make it their bufinefs to 
fearch into little flaws in ancient charters and flatutes, and to unfix what 
laudable cuftom hath well fixed, meet with any fuccefs. I write not this as if 
I fufpected your zeal in fuch a cafe, but to affure you of my ready concur- 
rence with you in any proper and legal means, whether by bill or otherwife, 
to make this excellent church fafe in this point, both now, and to late pofte- 
rity. Such provifions are to be endeavoured in a good reign, left in an evil 
one we feel the want of them. â€” I am, 

Your affectionate brother, 

Tho. Cantuar. 

Very foon after this a bill was carried into parliament, and pafTed into a 
law (6 An. c. 21.) which took away thofe doubts, by eftablifhing the vali- 
dity of the local (tatutes given by king Hen. 8. to his new foundations as 
aforefaid. 

In 1 713, he wrote an efiay or difcourfe, to be affixed to Mr. Chamber- 
lain's book, containing the Lord's prayer in one hundred different languages. 
Of which, Dr. Hickes gives the following character, in a later to Mr. Cham- 
berlain : â€” " I give you many thanks for communicating to me the bifhop of 
Carhfle's moft excellent letter, which fhews him to be a very great man, and 
to have a moft exact judgment, and which will be a great ornament to your 
book. I know not which is to be moft admired in it, the vaft variety of 
reading, or the putting all his obfervations together in fo fliort, clear, and 
eafy a difcourfe, which mightily confirms the hiftory of Mofes, and refutes 
the vain cavils which atheifts and deifts and latitudinarians are wont to make 
againft the truth of it. But, from the date of the letter, I wonder you 
would defire rne in laft February to write a difTertation of the fame nature, 
to be prefixed to your book. What could I have written of the fame nature, 
though never fo juftly or elaborately, but what he had written before, un- 
doubtedly with great pains and ftudy, though he has reduced all his reading of 
that kind into the compafs of a fhort letter-, v/hich fhews him to be a great 
mafter builder, as well as a great collector of proper materials, upon ti.at curi- 
ous fubject. You may fee from his citations, how truly I told you that\I had 
not the proper books for fuch a difcourfe ; or, if I had them (and I will now 
add, his flrength), that I would not undertake to write fuch a difcourfe in lefs 
time than halt a year. I wonder much more, that when you had imparted 

his 



296 CUMBERLAND W A U D. (Carslisle.) 

his lordlhip's admirable letter to me, you would again defire me to write a 
difcourfe of that nature. In doing of which, had I all his abilities of body 
and mind, I fhould expofe myfelf as an impertinent, though I could write as 
well as he hath done upon that fubject ; and as a man of great vanity, if my 
difcourfe came fhort of his. Therefore, befides my utter prefent inability, I 
muft plead how arrogant it would be in me to write any tiling of that nature, 
after fo excellent a difcourfe, to which nothing can be added (I think) by a 
club of the beft antiquaries, if they mould attempt to write on the fame fub- 
ject, which he has exhaufted in fhort." 

In 171 5, he was by the king made lord almoner, which office was refigned 
in his favour by the lord archbifhop of Canterbury. 

In 17(7, a collection of papers fcattered about the town in the Daily 
Courant and other periodical papers, with fome remarks addreflcd to the 
bifhop of Bangor, was publifhed in Octavo. 

In 1 71 8, letters patent palled the great feal of Ireland for his tranflation to 
the fee of Londonderry, to which he was nominated on the 17th of March, 
but was allowed to continue biihop of Carlifle and almoner till after Eafter. 

In 1- 19, he wrote a preface to the third edition of Dr. Wilkins's Leges 
Anglo-Saxonicae. 

He alio publifhed feveral fermons, and left three manufcript volumes in 
folio to the dean and chapter of Carlifle, confifting of copies and extracts 
from various books, manufcripts, regifters, records, and charters, relating to 
the diocefr of Carlifle, and from whence many things in thefe collections are 
tranferibed. There is alfo a large octavo manufcript of his, containing mif- 
celianeous accounts of the ftate of the churches, parfonage and vicarage 
houfes, glebe hnds, and other pofTeiTions, in the feveral parifhes within the 
diocefe, collected in his parochial vifitation of the feveral churches in the years 
1703, 1704, and 1707, now in the pofTeflion of his nephew Jofeph Nicolfon 
of Ilawkldale efquire. 

In the year 17 6, Feb. 9. he was tranflated to the archbifhoprick of Ca- 
fhell in the fame kingdom of Ireland ; but died fuddenly on the 14th of the 
fame month, and was buried in the cathedral church of Londonderry, with- 
out any monum.ntal infeription. 

He married Elizabeth youngeft daughter of John Archer of Oxenholme 
near Kendal efquire, and by her hid iflue eight children. 1. Thomas, who 
Jived only a few days. 2 Jofeph, chancellor of Lincoln, who married and 
hid two daughters. 3. John, a clergyman, who alfo married but had no 
child. 4. Mary, married to the reverend Dr. Thomas Benfor, and died with- 
out ifTue. 5. Caiherine, yet living, and unmarried. 6. Elizabeth, married 
to Bcilingham Mauleverer ckrk, and to him had 13 children, mofl of whom 
are now (1772) living. 7. Anne, married to Bolton efquire, to whom (he 
had two fonS. 8. Sufanna, who died unmarried. 

This biihop was of Cumberland extraction both by his father and mo- 
ther's fide. His father, the reverend Jofeph Nicolfon aforefaid, was fon

In the 8 ift year of his age, and the 13th of his confecration. 

A prelate, 

who by gradual and well merited advancements,. 

having paffed through every dignity to the epifcopal, 

fupported that, 

with an amiable aflfcmblage of graces and virtues :â€¢ 

which eminently formed, in his character, 

the courteous gentleman, and the pious chriftian ; 

and rendred him a fhining ornament. 

to his fpecies, his nation, his order. 

His deportment 

in all human relations and pofitions, 

was fquared by the rules of morality and religion, 

under the conftant direction of a confummate prudence 5 

whilft his equanimity

in an inviolable adherence to the golden medium, 

Eiade him eafy to himfelf and agreeable to others, 

and had its reward 

in a chearful life, a ferene old age, a compofed death. 

His excellent pattern 

was a continual lefibn of goodnefs and wifdom, 

and remains in his ever revereable memory 

an illufhious object of praile and imitation. 

This bifliop, having cut down and fold fome wood belonging to the bifhop-

49. Richard Osbaldiston. He was of the rich family of Hunmanby 
in the county of York â€¢, was bred at Cambridge; made dean of York; and 
in 1747 bifhop of Carlifle. He was tranflated to London in 1762, and died 
in 1764. 

50. Charles Lyttelton, was born in 17 14 at Hagley hall in Worcefter- 
fhire, being the third fon of Sir Thomas Lyitelton of Hagley and Frankley 
baronet, by ChrhHan daughter of Sir Richard Temple of Srowe in Bucking- 
hamshire baronet, fitter to the late lord vifcount Cobham. He was bred at Eaton 
fchool, and afterwards at Univerfity college in Oxford ; from whence he re- 
moved to the Middle Temple London, and was called to the bar ; but want 
of heal.th not permitting him to follow that laborious profcffion, he took 
orders, and returned to Oxford. In 1742, he became reclor of Alve church 
in Worcefterfhire, on the collation of old bifhop Hough. In 1747, he was 
appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to king George the fecond; and in 
the following year was promoted to the deanry of Exeter. In 1 762, he was 
advanced to the bifhoprick of Carlifle, on the tranflation of tifhop Ofbald- 
ifton ; and died at his houfe in Clifford Street London, Dec. 22, 1768 j and 
was buried in the family vault at Hagley. 

He was a gentleman of exienfive learning, and particularly in matters of 
antiquity, upon which account he was made prtfident of the Antiquarian 
Society. He was of a noble, generous, and humane difpofition ; a friend to 
all mankind, and never had an enemy. 

He was fucceedcd in the prefidentfhip of the faid fociety, by the reverend 
Dr. Milles dean of Exeter; who in his fpeech to the fociety upon that occa- 
sion, pays a due and juft tribute to his memory : â€” " I cannot repeat the 
'* name of our late moft refpecled and much lamented prefidenr, without 
" paying that grateful tribute to his memory, which his fervices to the 
" fociety whilft he lived, and his generofity perpetuated to them at his death, 
" do moft juftly demand of us ; and I am perfuaded, that every abfent as 
" well as prelent member will join in this acknowledgment with a moft will- 
" ing and grateful voice. It is not in my power to draw fuch a portrait 
" of his lordfhip, as can in any refpedl do juft ice to the original. His merits 
" and good qualities are fo univerfally acknowledged, and i"o deeply imprefied 
*'â€¢ on the minds of thofe who hear me, that their own ideas wiii paint them 
in more juft and lively colours than any words of mine can exprefs : I may 
be indulged however in recalling to your minds fuch parts of his character 
as particularly endeared him to the fociety, and therefore make his lofs 
more fenfibly felt by us. The ftudy of antiquity, efpecially that part of it 
which relates to the hiftory and conilitution of thefe kingdoms, was one of 
his earlieft and moft favourite purfuits ; and he acquired great knowledge 
in it by conftant ftudy and application, to which he was led, not only by 
his natural difpofition, but alfo by his ftate and fituation in life. He took 
frequent opportunities of improving and inriching this knowledge, by judi- 
cious obfervations, in the courfe of feveral journies which he made through 
every county in England, and through many parts of Scotland and Wales.

M The fociety has reaped the fruits of thefe obfervations, in the many valua- 
" ble papers which his lordmip from time to time has communicated to us ; 
M which are more in number, and not inferior either in merit or importance, to 
" thofe conveyed to us by other hands. Blefled with a retentive memory, 
" and happy both in the difpofition and facility of communicating his know- 
** ledge, he was enabled alfo to act the part of a judicious commentator and 
*' candid critic; explaining, illustrating, and correcting, from his own obfer- 
" vations, many of the papers which have been read at this fociety. His 
*' ftation and connections in the world, which neceffarily engaged a very con- 
<c fiderable part of his time, did not leflen his attention to the bufinefs and 
M interefts of the fociety. His doors were always open to his frfends, 
" amongit whom none were more welcome to him than the friends of litera- 
" ture, which he endeavoured to promote in all its various branches, efpe- 
M cially in thofe which are the more immediate objects of our attention. 
Â«â€¢' Even this circumftance proved beneficial to the fociety ; for, if I may be 
" allowed the exprefiion, he was the center in which the various informations 
" on points of antiquity from the different parts of the kingdom united, and 
Â«' the medium through which they were conveyed to us. His literary merit 
" with the fociety received an additional luftre, from the affability of his 
" temper, the gentlenefs of his manners, and the benevolence of his heart ; 
" which united every member of the fociety in efteem to their head, and in. 
" harmony and friendship with each other f." 

51. Edmund Law. He was born in the parifli of Cartmel in Lancalhire 
in 1703, whofe father was a clergyman of Weftmorland extraction from Afk- 
ham. He was educated at the fchools of Cartmel and Kendal. From the 
latter he removed to St. John's college in Cambridge â€¢, and after to Chrift's 
college in the fame univerfity, where he was chofen fellow. He was prefented 
by the faid univerfity to the valuable redtory of Grayftock in the county of 
Cumberland ; and afterwards was elected mafter of Peter-Houfe, vice-chan- 
cellor of the faid univerfity, principal librarian, and profefibr of cafuifticai 
divinity. He enjoyed alfo feveral dignities fucceffively in divers of the ca-

burne in Derbyfhire, commiffions the prior of Lanercoft, and his own official 
Adam de Appleby to elect one of the two and admit him to the faid office. â€” 
Again, in 1338, two are prefented to the bifhop for the office of fubprior,; 
and the official is impowered to make choice of one of them. 

1 7. John de Kirkby. 

18. Galfrid prior. 

19. John de Horncajlle, in 1352. â€” Bifhop Welton, in his vifitation of the

of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's in Carlifle, with the chapel of Seburoham, 
the church of Hayton with its chapels of Cumrew and Cumquinton, the 
churches of Crofby in Allerdale, Camberton, Ireby, and Beghokirk, Soure- 
by, Routhcliff, Edenhall with the chapel of Langwathby, and Adineham 
with the chapel of Saikeld, were held by the faid prior and convent appro- 
priate, and how it comes to pafs that there are no inftituted vicars in the faid 
churches of St. Mary's, St. Cuthbert's, Hayton, Routhecliff, Ireby, Crosfby, 
Camberton, and Beghokirk ; as alio how they come to demand a penfion of 
26s %d out of the rectory of Louthre, of 26s from Kirkland, of 6s %d from 
Ulnefby, of 2s from Hayton, and the like from each of the churches of

epifcopa! feal. 

In 1357, bifhop Welton received a command and powers from the fee of 
Rome (upon fome efpecial occafion) to vifit the prior and chapter. 

In 1360 the fame bifhop again vifits them ; and in 1365 they are vificed by 
bifhop Appleby, and again in 1373. 

In 1376, John de Horncaftle the prior complaining to the bifhop by peti- 
tion, that by reafon of age and infirmities he is not able to govern the convent 
any longer, and therefore requeuing permiffion to refign ; the bifhop accord-

Martin de Brampton was appointed by the bifhop to take care of the affairs 
of the convent. 

21. John de Penrith. In the year 1378, there were great differences be- 
tween him and one Roger de Clifton a member of the convent, which the 
bifhop at laft compofed.

22. William 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 303 

22. William de Daljlon, being appointed prior, refilled to fwear cnnonical 
obedience to the bifhop. Whereupon the bifhop excommunicates him. He 
appeals to the temporal court, the priory being of royal foundation. And 
the king's writ ifiiies to flop proceedings. At lad the difference was agreed -, 
and to make all things quiet, the prior was preferred, and refigned his 
priory. 

23. Robert de Edenhall, one of the canons, was chofen in the place of Wil- 
liam de Dalflon, and approved and inftituted by the bifhop, and thereupon

En doimas hsec floruit Godibour fub tegmine Thomas. 

29. Simon Senhoufe of the houfe of Seafcales in Cumberland was chofen 
prior in 1507. He repaired or beautified the fquare tower within the pre- 
cincts of the priory, and caufed feveral Englifh verfes to be infcribed on

Vulnera quinque Dei, fint medicina mei. 

30. Chriftopher Slee. He built the weft gatehoufe from the foundation, 
which is vet (landing. On the infide whereof, this infeription is graved round

DExANS OF CARLISLE. 

Out of the difTolved priory, king Henry the eighth, by letters patent 
bearing date May 8, 1542, founded and eftablifhed the body corporate of a 

dean 



3 o 4 CUMBERLAND WARD. (Carlisle.) 

dean and four prebendaries of the holy and undivided Trinity of Carlifle, and 
appointed the lad prior to be the firft dean, viz. 

1. Lancelot Salkeld, who continued dean all king Henry the eighth's time, 
but was ejected in the reign of king Edward the fixth, reftored by queen 
Mary, and again ejected by queen Elizabeth in 1559, an ^ ^ied the year after, 
and was buried in the cathedral. 

2. On Lancelot Salkeld's firft deprivation by king Edward the fixth, Sir 
Thomas Smith knight, fecretary of ftate, was made dean, but on queen Mary's 
accefiion Sir Thomas Smith was deprived, and afterwards by queen Elizabeth 
reftored. He was doctor of laws of Queen's college in Cambridge, and pub- 
lic profeffor of civil law for fome time in that univerfity. He was in deacon's 
orders â€¢, and prefided as dean 20 years, but feldom or never vifited his deanry. 
He writ a book intitled " The commonwealth of England ;" which was 
tranflated into latin by two different hands : Another, ftyled " De recta et 
emendata linguas Grascas pronunciatione :" And another, intitled " Dialogus 
de recta et emendata linguae Anglicanas fcriptione." He was much employed 
in the affairs of the reformation, and was one of thofe employed in compiling 
the book of common prayer. In his time we meet with many grants of the 
advovvlbns of livings for 2, 3, or 4 turns fuccedively, and leafes for long 
terms, and concurrent leafes to take place after the expiration of the former. 
But this was not the fault of his time only ; for the practice continued 
more or lefs, till the reflraining flatutes were made in the reign of queen 
Elizabeth. He died in 1577, and was buried at Mount Theydon in EfTex, 
on the north fide of the chancel, where is his effigies and a monumental

a widow (which by the ancient canons it was not lawful for clerks to do). 
He died at Pyrford in Surry about the begining of March 1595, and was

lege in Cambridge, of which he became mafter. In 1642, being concerjied 
(amongft the reft) in fending the plate of that univerfity to the king, he was 
deprived of all his preferments, and died in 1653, and was buried in St. 
Botolph's church in Cambridge. His fuccefior, at the reftoration of the

PARISH OF DALSTON. 

Dalston is the next parish fonthward. In the regifter of bifhop Kirkby, 
about the year 1333, the boundary of it is thus defcribed : l - Limites et 
bundce ecclefias parochialis de Dalfton ex una parte incipiunt ab aqua de 
Caldew fubtus Parva Dalfton, et fie afcendendo per Potkoke ufque le Brend- 
thwayr, et fie per le Merfike ufque Thornholm, e; deinde ufque acl le

deinde ufque ad aquam de Ive, et deinde ufque ad aquam de Raugh, et 
deinde ficut parochia de Dalfton et Sowerby inter fe dividunt ufque in aquam 
de Caldew." 

Mr. Denton fays, that earl Ranulph de Mefchiens gave the b-:.rony of Dal- 
fton to Robert de Vallibus, brother of Hubert de Vallibus firft baron of Gilf- 
land, who thereupon took the name of Robert de Dalfton -, and that the de- 
fcendents of the faid Robert pofiefTed that barony in a lineal defcenr, till king 
Stephen gave Cumberland to David king of Scots. However, not long after, 
we find it in the hands of the crown. For by the record of an afiiie in the 
6 Ed. 1. the jurors find, that the barony of Dalfton, wi;h the advowfon of 
the church there, efcheated to the king, by reafon of the owner thereof Henry 

fon 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Dalston.) 3ii 

fon of Maurinus (Morifon) being attainted of felony. Morifon is a Scotch 
name; and perhaps king David granted this barony to him, and upon Henry 
the fecond's recovering the fame from the Scots, the felony might eafily accrue. 
It continued in the crown till the reign of king Henry the third, who by his 
charter in the 14th year of his reign, grants to Walter (Malclerk) bifhop of 
Carlifle and his fucceflbrs the manor of Dalfton, with the advowfon of the 
church there, with fac, and foke, and woods, and mills, and all other appur- 
tenances : To hold the fame difafForefted, with power to affart and make in- 
clofures, and difpofe of the wood at their will and pleafure, without the view 
or interruption of his forefters, verderers, regarders, or other officers-, and 
that they mall be free from fuits, and fummonfcs, and pleas of the foreft; and 
have liberty to hunt and take deer and other game within the faid manor, and 
no other fhall have fuch liberty without their permiffion ; and (hall hold the 
faid manor as a foreft, as the king held the fame before the faid grant. The 
faid bifhop and his fucceffors to find one canon regular to fay mafs every day 
in the church of St. Mary Carlifle, for the fouls of the king and of his father 
and all his anceftors and fucceflbrs*. 

And by another charter the fame king further grants, that if they or any 
perfon with their permiffion fhall chafe any game within their foreft of Dalfton, 
and the faid game fhall fly into the king's foreft, they may puriue and take the 
fame within the king's foreft, and return without the moleftation of any of 
the king's forefters or other officers -f\ 

Neverthelefs, in the laft year of Hen. 3. Michael de Harcla brought an 
action againft bifhop Coucy for this manor-, and although the record fays, that 
the bifhop recovered, yet in the 7 Ed. 1. it feems to have been again ftirred, 
for in that year bifhop Irton paid to the faid Michael 320 marks of filver, 
which feems to have been for an abfolute difcharge. How Harch's title ac- 
crued doth not appear: he only fets forth that he was fon of William, fon of 
Michael, fon of Walter, fon of Michael, fon of Walter, brother of Robert, 
brother of Hcrvicius, who was duly feifed in the reign of king Henry the firft, 
and whofe clerk and prefentee (Americk Talbot) was admitted and inftituted 
into the rectory of Dalfton aforefaid. 

There are in this manor about 20 freeholders, 114 copyholders, and 40 
cuftomary tenants, befides about 40 leafeholders for lives. 

A copyholder, at the death of tenant or upon alienation, pays to the lord one 
year's rent for a fine, and no more ; may leafe out his lands for any term he 
pleafes* and hath power to fell or difpofe of all the wood growing upon his 
copyhold land. The widow is intitled to thirds of all the lands her hufband 
at any time poffefled during the coverture, if fhe does not join in the fuirender 
and be privately examined by the fteward. The hufband, if he furvives, en- 
joys her lands for life. Female heirs inherit in coparcenary. In mortgages, 
there muft be a furrender, and one year's rent for a fine paid : And as long as 
the mortgagor continues in pofieffion, his heir, and not the heir of the mort- 
gagee is admitted, though it has been a forfeited mortgage never fo long.

The cuftomary tenants pay two years rent as a fine to the lord, upon every 
change of tenant by death or alienation \ and before fuch time as he hath paid 
the faid fine or made tender thereof, he cannot fell nor make a leafe of his 
cuftomary lands. But nothing is paid upon the death or translation of the 
bifhop. The rldeft female heir inherits, and the wife is only in titled to the 
thirds of fuch lands as her hofband died poffeiTcd of. Nor is the hufb.\nd in- 
titled to a life's eftate in his wife's lands after her death. In mortgages, as 
well as abfolute fales, no title is had but by deed, furrender, 2nd admittance. 
A full fine is paid upon a mortgage, and the heir of the mortgagor (fo long as 
he continues in pofTeffion) is always admitted. 

The cuftomary tenant, as well as the copyholder and freeholder, is intitled 
to all the wood upon his eftate, and to open quarries of ftone for lime, either 
upon his own eftate or the common, as alfo to dig clay for bricks to be ufed 
upon their own eftates within the manor refpecTively, but not otherwife. 

All the tenants of whatever denomination are to do fuit and fervice at the 
lord's courts, and to grind all their corn at his miln, and to pay the 13th moul- 
ter for all fuch as they grow, and the 20th for the corn that they buy. 

About the year 1698 a fuit in chancery was commenced between the corpo- 
ration of Carlifle on the one part, and the bifhop of Carlifle and his tenants 
of Dalfton, Crofby, and Linftock on the other part, concerning their paying 
toll to the corporation. Which after leveral ifiues at law, and an expence of 
above 1000/ on the part of the bilhop's tenants only, was July 7, 1707, de- 
creed upon the equity referved, that the tenants of Crofby and Linftock fhall 
pay toll, but that thofe of Dalfton, as fuch, are exempted from the payment 
of any toll. Which decree was further explained Dec. 15, 1708, viz. that 
the tenants or farmers of the faid manor of Dalfton ought to have the privi- 
lege of exemption as well for corn as other goods and things bought for the 
ufe of them and their families, as for any goods or commodities wrought up 
or manufactured by them, or cattle bought, fed, or grazed on their lands; 
but that fuch exemption ought not to extend to badgers, or thofe who carry 
on a trade of buying of corn or grain, felling it again without manufacturing, 
or of other goods unmanufactured to fell the fame again, or to drovers of 
cattle or others who by fraud come in to buy or rent lands or tenements, or 
take a cottage without land barely to get or gain an exemption from toll. 

Rose has been the principal manfion-houfe of the bifhops of Carlifle, fince 
the firft grant of this manor to the fee. It feems to have had its name from 
the Britifh word Rbos, which fignifies a moift dale or valley. King Edward 
the third in the 10th year of his reign granted leave to embattle it, from which 
time it hath had the title of Rofe-Cajlle (though the Scots burnt it the very 
next year). 

It fuffered many outrages and violence from the Scots from time to time; 
neverthelefs, being repaired again as faft as the Scots demolifhed it, it conti- 
nued a comfortable habitation until its total demolition in the civil wars in 
the reign of king Charles the firft. Before that time, it confifted of a com- 
pleat quadrangle, with a fountain in the middle; with five towers, and other 

lefler

againft Kite's tower, in the wall, containing one lodging room. The other 
turret containing one chamber below, and one above. 

What ftate this place was reduced to by the civil wars, will appear from the-

follows : 

Imprimis : A decayed caftle, with a large mantle wall, built with hewn 
ftone; the caftle by eftimation containing about half an acre, with a void

Mem. The furveyors had the caflle viewed by very able artifls, which they 
carried with them for that purpofe ; and they valued the fame (all charges dif- 
burfed) at 1000/. Yet we are of opinion, that the fame to be iold to a 
gentleman who will purchafe the whole demefnes, and make it his habitation, 
to be worth 1500/. 

When bifliop Rainbow came to the fee, no part of the houfe was habitable, 
fave only from the chapel fouthward to the end of the old kitchen. He built 
the two parlours, chapel, entrance or pafiage, and the great flair-cafe. Bifhop 
Smith built the tower adjoining, flables, dairy, brewhoufe, fitted up the two 
parlours, and altered the whole houfe. Bifhop Fleming wainfcotted the fir ft 
parlour, and three rooms above flrairs, with the flair-cafe, and laid the floors 
of the faid three rooms all anew; for which he fold wood belonging ro the fee, 
according to an account entred in his regifler. When bifhop Ojbaldifton came 
to the fee, he bullied bifliop Fleming's executors out of 200/ which the faid 
bifhop Fleming had allowed to his leffee of Buley caftle in Weflmorland for 
his interefl in the wood fold there, and for damages and fpringing it again. 
The faid bifhop Ofbaldifton cut and fold all the alder wood upon the demefne 
at Rofe, with large quantities of oak and afh, to the value of many hundred 
pounds. Indeed he new floored and wainfcotted the inner parlour, new flagged 
the halls and kitchen, and put a new coping upon the old walls on the fide

of the garden. He alfo built a new farm lioufe, and a poor forry fmall barn 
in the lingy park ; all which together might perhaps coil about 350/. Bein^ 
this feveral hundred pounds into pocket, he was glad to compound with his 
fucceiTor bifnop Lyttelton for 250/ dilapidations, which his faid fucceflbr chofe 
to accept, rather than be at the trouble and expenceof a long litigation. The 
faid bifhop Lyttelton built a very fine new kitchen, laundry, and brevvhoufe, 
repaired Strickland tower, and altered and improved the whole houfe fo much, 
that it is bow a convenient and comfortable habitation ; of all which addition's 
and improvements he caufed a particular account to be entered in his regifter. 

.Anciently, every bifhop of Carlrfle, at his death, was obliged to leave to his 
fucetficra certain number of books of divinity and canon law ; and likewife 
104 oxen, 16 heifers,, and other quick goods in proportion **. 

Notwithstanding the poverty of this lee, the bifhops here lived formerly in 
preat fplendcr. For at the end of bifhop White's rental in 1627, a very large 
family cftablifhment is mentioned -,- and after reciting the name and office of 
every fervant, concludes thus: "The conftant houfhold, befides workfoik 
and Grangers, about 0,5 or 36; amongft whom are^ a gentleman- ufher, a, 
ileward, a chamberlain, and the bifhop's folicitor." 

The frrft mefne lordfnip within this barany is Little Dalston â€¢, of which,. 
Dalfton hall is the capital or manfion-houfe. It was granted (as is aforefaid) to, 

1. Robert brother to Hubert de Vallibus firft baron of Gilfland, who there- 
upon afilimed the name de Da/Jion. He had a > ion,

12. J.ohn, fon of Ro! err, married a daughter and coheir of 'Kirk bride. 

13. 1 hemes, fon of John, married Mabel Denton of Cardew. Unto this -

Upperton, and Kirkbride, parcel of the pcffefTions of the late Henry earl of 
Northumberland, and the manorof Temple Sowerby, parcel of the pofieflions

and its reprefentative in parliamenrin the 16 Cha. 1. 

17. Sir William "Daljlon fon of George, was created baronet in the 16 Cha. 1. 
He and his father were both great fufferers in the royal caufe. He refided 
moftly at Pleath hall in Yorkfhire, and died there Jan. 13, 1683. 

18. Sir George, his fon, was knighted in his father's life-time, and married 
the elded daughter of Sir William Ramfden of Byrom, and died in his fathers 
life-time, leaving only one daughter.

iflue male, fold this eftate in 1761 to Mr. Monkhoufe Davifon grocer in Lon-

daughter. 

This little lordfnip confifts of a few tenants difperfed infeveral places within 
the manor and barony of Dalfton, who pay a yearly cuftomary rent of 2/155 
yd, with arbitrary fines ; but fee m in titled, like- as the reft, to the wood grow- 
ing upon their cuftomary tenements. 

Cardew is another mefne lordfhip within this barony, and confifts of about 
14'tenancies at Cardewlees. It was anciently called Carthieu, having taken 
the name from that .great fenny ground at the head of the river Wathempole, 
now' called Cardew- mire, and by the ancient inhabitants Car-tbieu, which is by 
interpretation God's fen, or God's meadow ; and fo denominated by them, for 
that it adjoined unto Th'urfby\ where the Saxons had a houfe of facrifice or 
temple of worfhip, where thofe pagans offered up the blood of the captives 
to a god whom in that fort they honoured called Thor. 

It was anciently foreft ground, and parcel of that great foreft of Engle- 
wood, and became firft inhabited, according to Mr. Denton, in the reign of 
king William- R.ufusor Henry the firft. The faid Mr. Denton, whole .manu- 
script account of Cumberland we have often had occafion to quote;, was 
owner of this manor, and refided at Cardew hall. In one of the copies of 
the laid manulcript which bifnop Nicolfon fays was lent'to him by Mr. Bird 
of- Brougham in 1703, .is the following pedigree : .

Carlifle in truft for the ufe of John Eurdon. 

The faid John Burdon had alfo a fon John Burdon, upon whom his father 
intailed the manor of Cardew and the heirs of his body ; and on default of 
fuch iflue, to John de Denton and Joan his wife, kiniwoman and heir of Bur- 
don, if John Burdon the fon fhould die without ifilie, which event accordingly 
happened. And here begins the pedigree of the Dentons of Cardew. 

1. John de Denton, by his wife Joan de Kirkbride (daughter of Walter de 
Kirkbride by his wife Alice daughter and heir of William de Burdon knight, 
brother of John de Burdon the father aforefaid) had iflue a fon,

9. John Denton, author of the aforefaid manufcript account of Cumber- 
land. He married a daughter of Sir John Dalfton of Dalfton knight, and by 
her had iflue, 

10. Henry, who married Julian daughter of Sir Richard Mufgrave of Nor- 
ton in the county of York, and by her had iflue, 

11. George, who married Catharine daughter of George Graham of Nun- 
nery, and by her had iflue 4 fons and 4 daughters. He was colonel of a 
regiment of foot in the fervice of king Charles the fir ft ; and fuffertd giea:ly 
in that king's caufe. 

12. George Denton of Cardew efquire, fon of George, was of the age of 
15 at Dugdale's vifitation in 1665. 

In 1672, for 61 years ancient rent, he fold to the tenants their rrefluages 
and tenements free from all rents, fines, heriots, carriages, boons, and other 
fervices ; referving only one penny yearly rent, fuit of court, and royalties. 
And in 1686 he fold the whole remainder to Sir John I owther of Lowther ba- 
ronet, anceftor of Sir James Lowther baronet the prtfent owner. 

In 1690, the faid Sir John Lowther fold to the tenants a parcel of common 
called Cardew leafe flint, containing 35 acres, for the yearly rent of iys; 
referving to himielf the royalties, and fait of ccurt for the manor of Parton 
(of which this lordfhip or manor cf Cardew now is parcel). 

The paternal arms of the Dentons of Cardew were, Argent, two bars and 
three martlets in chief Gules. The Cn (t -, On a rower Sable breathing out

Gateskale and Raughton were at the conqueft all foreft and wafle 
ground, and were firft inclofed by way of purprefture by one Ugthrcd, to be 
holden of the king in fee farm by ferjeanty for keeping the eyries of hawks 
for the king, which bred in the foreft of Englewood. 

Gatejkale being a whinny place, where the inhabitants of Raughton made 
fcales or fhields for their gates (or goats), from thence took its name ; as 
Raughton did from the beck or river, called Raugh (or Raghe), which fignifies 
a rough, rapid water. 

The pofterity of Ughtred took their furname of the place, and gave the 
fparhawk for their cognizance. It continued in this name and family for 
feveral generations; till the laft of the name fettling it upon his wife Margaret 
(Stapleton), and fhe dying without iffue, her brother William Stapleton of 
Edenhall fucceeded to the inheritance. In like manner the Mufgraves fuc- 
ceeded the Stapletons by a female heir, and towards the "end of the fourteenth 
century fettled it upon a younger fon, whofe chief feat was at Hayton, in 
which houfe it ftill continues. 

Here are in this manor 22 freehold tenants, who pay 1/ 8s S^d yearly free 
rent, do fuit and fervice at the lord's court when called upon, and alfo pay 
yearly to the duke of Portland as chief lord of the foreft of Englewood the 
fum of 2/ 13 s 2d or thereabout, and likewife fend a man to appear for them 
at the foreft court at Hefket every St. Barnabas's day, who is to be upon the 
inqueft. 

About four miles from the church, and within the faid parifh of Dalfton, 
ftands High-head caftle within the manor thereunto adjoining and be- 
longing. 

By an inquifition in the 16 Ed. 2. it is found, that John de Harcla held the 
caftle of High-head (pelam de Higheved) with 60 acres of land there newly 
aflarted ; and that the faid John enfeoffed his brother Andrew thereof after 
the death of the faid John. â€” When this Andrew de Harcla was feized at Car- 
lifle for treafon by the lord Lucy, word thereof was immediately fent to his 
brother at High-head who forthwith fled into Scotland, and with him Sir 
William Blount and many others. Upon Andrew's conviction, and his brother's 
flight as aforefaid, this inquifition feemeth to have been taken, and the pre- 
mises feized by the king : who foon after (as it feemeth) granted the fame to 
Ranulph de Dacre ; for in the 2 Ed. 3. it is found by inquifition, that Ra- 
nulph de Dacre tenuit pelam de Higheved, by the fervice of five marks. 

In the 18 Ed. 3. WHlliam Englijh (Lengleys) held the manor of Higheved 
of the king by the fervice of one rofe yearly : William EngliJJj being his fon 
and heir. Which William the fon in 1358 obtained a licence from bifhop 
Appleby to build a chapel here, and to have a chaplain to attend in it. 

In the %$ Hen. 8. William Rejlwold held of the king the manor of High- 
head as an approvement of the foreft of Englewood in capite by fealty and the

It was purchafed of Reftzvold by John Richmond efquire ; who had a fori

acres, which he feems to have fully juftified. In the pleadings the following 
boundary is infifted on : " lncipiendo ad Siplingill hedge, et lie defcendendo

Ifabella Towerfon about the year 1678, and had iffue Henry, and 6 daughters, 
5 of which daughters married, and are dead.; one of the faid daughters, Sufan-

The church of Dalfton is dedicated to St. Michael ; and valued in the 
king's books at 8/ 18 s i~d. Having been given to the fee of Carlifle, along 
with the manor as aforefaid, it was foon after appropriated thereto. And the

that William Griffith vicar was buried in December 1642.

The school at Dalfton is endowed with a flock of 138./, and a tenement 
in Hawkfdale called New Hall, of about 7/ yearly value, given (upon the 
attainder of John Lowther of the Cawfey at Rofe Caftle for murder) by bi- 
fhop Smith, who alfo rebuilt the fchool-houfe. 

About the year 1343, forty days indulgence was granted by bifhop Kirkby, > 
to all fuch as fhould give any money, books, veftments, or other things, 
towards the repairs of the chapel of St. Wynemius the bifhop, or to the fup- 
port of Hugh de Lilford an hermit there, made overfeer of the repairs of the 
laid chapel in the parifli of Dalfton. No tradition now remains, what this 
chapel was, or where fituate, nor of the hermit or his hermitage. Indeed 
there is a field, about a mile from the parifh church, called Chapel Flat, in a 
part of which freeftones have frequently been dug up, which feems to indicate 
fome fort of building there. And the fituation, amongft rocks, water, \ and 
wood, is not unlikely for the folitary retirement of an hermit. 

And that there was anciently here a Britifh temple or fomething of that 
fort, is evident, for that a good many years ago a circle of rude ftones about 
three foot in diameter was difcovered, the whole circle being about 30 yards 
in circumference. And within the circle, towards the eaft point, were found 
four ftones, much of the fame form as the reft, lying one upon another, fup- 
pofed to be fomething of the Keft-vaen kind. 

Not far from hence is a very regular tumulus or barrow, about eight yards 
in diameter at the bottom and two at the top, and about three yards in . 
height. When opened, there were found near the top two freeftones about 
three foot long, one broad, and about fix inches thick, whch had a fort of 
circle very rudely cut out or marked near the top, but nothing was found, 
underneath, though the ground was opened above 4 foot below the level. 

About half a mile S. S. W. from hence was a fmall Roman camp of about 
fifty yards diameter; and much about the fame diflance N. N. E. another 
Roman camp of the like dimenfions. Alfo a third, about a mile S. E. much 

T t 2 larger' 



324 CUMBERLAND WARD. (Dalston.) 

larger than the other. None of thefe three camps are above a mile from Rofe 
Caftle, and the firft not one fourth of that diftance, where Mr. Camden places 
tbe Congavata. of the Romans, but Mr. Horfley upon much better grounds 
fixes that ftation at Stanwix. The two fmaller of thefe camps are now arable 
land, and have been frequently plowed, but no coins or infcriptions have been 
difcovered. The other is upon an uncultivated moor, and hath never been 
any way fearched or tried. But fmall hand mill-ftones and other things have 
been found in them all, fufficient to evince them to be Roman. 

About a mile or fomewhat more from Rofe Caftle weft ward, is Sbalk beck, 
where are large and fine quarries of freeftone, from whence it is fuppofed a 
great part of the ftone which built the Roman wall from Carlifle to Bownefs 
was taken. From the appearance of the place, it is certain that immenfe 
quantities have been carried away from thence ; and lately, on removing a 
vaft heap of rubbifh from before the rock in one part, in order to carry the 
works further back, was found upon the face of the rock the following 
infcription j

Dalfton is no market town, yet there is a very large crofs, which feems to 
have been built at the expence of the neighbouring gentlemen, as the feveral 
coats of arms thereupon do indicate. The three kites heads, on one of the 
coats, which were the arms of bifhop Kite, refer the erecting of it to his 
time. Croffes, foon after the eftablifhment of chriftianity in this ifland, were 
put up in moft places of public concourfe, to remind the people of the bene- 
fit vouchfafed to us by the crofs of Chrift. The poor folicited alms at thofe 
croffes (as the faying is to this day) for Chrift' s fake ; and when a peribn is 
urgent and vehement, we fay, he begged like a cripple at a crofs. At thofe 
croffes, the corps in carrying to church was fet down, that all the people at- 
tending might pray for the foul of the departed. In perambulating the 
boundaries of parifbes, croffes were erected at certain diftances, where the 
people prayed, and at the fame time regaled themfelves. We fign children 
in baptifm with the fign of the crofs. And in many ancient charters, where a 
man could not write his name, he put the fymbol of the crofs ; which kind 
of fignature is even yet not out of ufe J. 

It was certified in 1747, that there were in this parifh 220 families, all of 
the church of England.

v v y 6 PARISH 



CUMBERLAND WARD. (Sebergham.) 32; 

PARISH OF SEBERGHAM. 

Sebergham, or Sebraham, is the next parifh to Dalfton, and the laft in this 
ward towards the fouth. It was fo called from the place where it ftands, 
which is a hill or riling ground in the fbreft of Englewood, whereof the eaft 
and fouth eaft parts were woodland and dry ground â€¢, but the fouth, weft, and 
north weft parts were wet fpringy ground covered with rufhes, which the 
country people call Jieves j and thereupon the place was called Sievy-burgh, or 
fievy hill. At the time of the conqueft, it was a great wafte and wildernefs. 
Afterwards, in the latter end of king Henry the fecond's time, one William 
Waftall, or de Wafte-dale r began to inclofe fome part of it. He was an hermit, 
and lived there to an extreme old age, by the labour of his hands, and the 
fruits of trees. He came hither in Henry the firft's time, and died about the 
end of king John's reign, or in the beginning of Henry the third's. King 
John granted him the hill Sebergham, and he left it to the priory of Carlifle. 

The parifh in general is the manor of the duke of Portland, who hath here 
about 80 tenants, who pay an ancient free rent of 4/ ys Â±d, copyhold rent 
5/ 11 s 6d, and pannage is lid. But they are now all made freeholders by 
the improvement of the commons, for which they pay an additional free rent 
of 58 / 2 s 4d. 

The dean and chapter of Carlifle have alfo an independent manor here (per â€¢ 
haps from the hermit aforefaid) which is likewile called the manor of Seberg- 
ham i which confifts of about 16 cuftomary tenants, five leaieholders, and one 
freeholder. The cuftomary tenants are now all made freeholders, by their 
fhares of the faid commons ; for which they pay a quit rent of 4/ 7 s $^d to 
the faid dean and chapter. And to prevent for the future all interference of 
manerial rights or jurifdiclions, it is agreed and declared by the ad of parlia- 
ment for dividing and inclofing the faid commons, that the manor of the faid 
dean and chapter (hall extend only to the leafehold and cuftomary eftates held 
under them, and to the feveral parcels of the faid common or wafte ground 
allotted to the faid leafehold and cuftomary eftates, by virtue of the laid aÂ£t. 

Mr. Denton of Warnel hall holds alfo a mefne manor of Warnel hall within 
this parifh ; who is of an ancient family fprung from Denton in Gilfland 
in this county, whofe pedigree was certified at Dugdale's vifitation in 1665,

The church is dedicated to St. Mary, and is a perpetual curacy, in the pa. 
tronage of the dean and chapter of Carlifle, who are the appropriators. It 
doth not occur in any of the ancient valuations ; but was certified in 1739 to 
the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 19/, and having received an aug- 
mentation by lot, and another in conjunction with 200 /given by John Simp- 
fon efquire, and being greatly advantaged by the late inclofure and divifion 
of the common, it is now worth upwards of 100 / per annum. 

The parifh contains about 11 1 families; all of the church of England, 
except only i Quaker. 

PARISH OF WARWICK. 

We mud now turn to the eaft fide of Carlifle, and the firft parifh that 
there preients itfelf is Warwick, which feems to have been anciently a 
chapelry in the parifh of Wetheral. It begins at the foot of Sawbeck where 
the faid beck falls into Eden below Warwick bridge, lb along the river Eden 
to the Dead water (or ancient courfe of the faid river) to Pow Maugham 
beck, then up that beck to the Carr fyke, and along the Carr fyke through

The firft is the manor of the family of Aglionby, who finally fettled at Nun- 
nery in this county, and was fo called of Agullon their firft anceftor, who came 
into England with William the Conqueror and feated himfelf here.

Elias had iflue Alan, who had iffue William, who had iffue Adam, who had iffue 
John, who had iffue Adam that lived in the reign of Edw. 1. and married 
Julian Whitfield.

John, fon of Edward, married a daughter of Salkeld of Corby. 

Thomas, fon of John, married a daughter of Cuthbert Mufgrave of Crookdake. 

About this time lived John Aglionby, a younger brother (as it feemeth) of this 
family,. who was a ftudent in and fellow of Queen's college in Oxford, became 
a moft polite and learned preacher, was principal of Edmund Hall in 1600, 
and the year after rector of Iflip in Oxfordfhire. He had a considerable hand

Odard firft lord of Corkeby, to be holden of his barony of Gilfland. This 
Odard, in the pedigree certified by Thomas Warwick efquire at Sir William 
Dugdale's vifitation in 1665, is faid to be Odard de Logis firft baron of 
Wigton. But the fubfequent account doth not at all agree with the family of 
the lords of Wigton ; therefore this muft have been another Odard, concern- 
ing whom the pedigree proceeds as follows : 

1. Odard, firft lord of Corby and of Warwick, had iffue Ofbert and William.

wherein their fifh pool was ftrengthened and fecured, (in qua jiagnum firmatum

King William Rufus by his charter confirms to the abbey of St. Mary's 
York the a 11 of St. Conftantine of Wetherhal and the manor there, with the

which could only be furmounted by means of a ladder, which the perfon amend- 
ing might draw up after him. The wall in front that makes the gallery is 
founded on a ledge of a rock about 8 feet below the floor of the cells, and is 
raifed a little above the top of the cells, and heretofore was joined to them by a 
roof covered with lead or (late. In the middle of the wall is a chimney, and

In the divifion of Combquinton and Coathill in this parifh, the owner of Ar- 
mathwaite caftle hath a manor, having at Coathill 7 cuftomary tenants, who- 
pay 18 s 6 d cuftomary rent, arbitrary fines, and heriots ; and at Combquinton 12 
tenants pay il us 4 <i cuftomary rent, with like fines and heriots. Alfo the Ag- 
lionbys of Nunnery have here a manor, having 3 4 tenants, who pay yearly 7 / 3 s 9 d 9 . 
with like arbitrary fines and heriots. They alfo pay boondays fhearino- and 
leading coals, with a certain quantity of oats called Fojler oats (perhaps hereto- 
fore for the ufe of theforejters, this part being within the foreft of Englewood). 
Six pecks of which oats are equal to four of Carlifle meafure. 

The church of Wetheral is dedicated to the holy and undivided Trinity, and. 
is in the patronage of the dean and chapter of Carlifle ; unto which, jointly with 
Warwick, they prefent a perpetual curate, and allow him a falary of 52/ a year. 
There is alfo a little neat houfe belonging to it, with a fmall field adjoining. 

In 1747, it was certified, that there were in this parifh 229 families ; of which, 
quakers andprefbyterkns 4, and papifts 10. 



LEETH WARD. 
PARISH OF HESKET. 

A Dvancing from Carlifle towards theSouthand South-Eafl,wecometoLEETH 
'**â€¢ Ward ; in which the firft parifh is that of Hesket, which is generally 
fuppofed to have been a chapelry only within the parifh of St. Mary's Carlifle. 
But fo early as the reign of king Edward the third, by an inqueft then taken, 
the parifhes of St. Mary Hefket and of Wetheral are feverally and diftinclly 
afcertained. But being appropriated to the priory of Carlifle, it was fupplied 
(as was ufual in churches belonging to (he religious houfes, that lay near to 
i'uch houfe) by one of their own body. And perhaps the prior, in eafe of his 
2 canons, 



LEETH WARD. (Hesket.) 339 

canons, might require them to bring their dead to be buried at Carlifle, or 
poffibly they might defire it as a particular favour â€¢, for the people in thofe 
days were ambitious, and fometimes gave large donations, to be interred amongfl: 
thofe holy brethren. Dr. Todd relates a tradition, than the firft erection of a 
chapel here was about the year 1530, when an infectious diftemper raging in 
the country, and the people bringing their dead as ufual to be buried within the 
city of Carliile, the mayor and citizens fnut the gates upon them, and from the 
walls advifed them to carry back the corps and bury the fame at a place then 
called Walling Stone â€¢, and that if they did fo, and complied with their advice, 
they and others would endeavour to prevail with the bifhop of the diocefe, to 
have a chapel built and confecrated there, which would be of perpetual ufe to 
them and their pofterity. And they complying with this propofal, as foon as 
the plague was ceafed, a chapel was built, and the then bifhop (John Kite) at- 
tended by Sir Chriftopher Dacre knight, Sir John Lovvther knight, and a great 
number of gentlemen and others of the country and neighbourhood, did in a 
folemn manner confecrate it and the church or chapel yard, and by proclama- 
tion fet out and fixed the bounds thereof. â€” All which perhaps may amount to 
this, that the church or chapel was then rebuilt, and had then firft the right of 
fepulture granted to it. 

The dean and chapter of Carlifle, as fucceflbrs of the prior and convent, are 
the impropriators, and nominate a perpetual curate, and oblige their leffees of 
the tithes to pay him yearly 18/5*0^; befides which, Mr. John Brown of this 
parifh gave 200/, whereby an augmentation of 200/ was procured from the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty: with which fum of 400 /lands were pur- 
chafed at Hefket and Mill Yate, now of the yearly value of 14/. 

Of this Mr. Brown, his nephew and heir Mr. Lofh caufed the following 
memorial to be infcribed in the church of Hefket :

yearly copyhold rent, and a Tingle year's rent upon change of tenant, and no- 
thing upon the death of the lord. And the tenant has all the wood that grows 
upon his eftate. 

One of the principal mefne manors is that belonging to Armathwaite- 
castle ; unto which there are feveral appendages, the tenants of all which 
places do fuit and fervice to the court at Armathwaite. In Armathwaite, are 4 
freeholders, who pay 10'^d yearly free rent; and 12 cuftomary tenants, who 
pay yearly 3/ 18s 4^ cuftomary renr, 16 days boon fhearing, and fuit of mill. 
At Nether Southwaite, one freeholder, who pays yearly 2/3^4^ free rent. At 
Coathill 7 cuftomary tenants, who pay yearly 18 s 6d cuftomary rent, 8 days

and 15 heriots. At Cajllecarrock, 12 cuftomary tenants, who pay yearly 
2/ us 6d cuftomary rent. And the cuftomary tenants throughout pay arbi- 
trary fines. 

Armathwaite caftleanciently belonged to the Skeltons, which family is of great 
antiquity in this county, and whofe chief place of refidence was for many ages.- 
here. But they were likewife poflefled of feveral lands in the weftern parts of 
this county, as at Whitrigg, Threapland, Bellafis, Thornbank, Kirkthwaite, 
Lynthwaite, Arkleby, Langlands, and Branthwaite. From the name, there 
feems to be no doubt but that they came from Skelton in this county, but of that 
we havenot metwith any account. There is not any regular pedigree of the family 
that hath fallen under our notice, except one of 5 generations only, certified by 
John Skelton efq.uire at Dugdale's vifitation in 1665. Therefore the following 
account is not to be looked upon as a regular fuccefiion from father to fon, bua 
only a lift of names that have occafionally occurred, including (very probably) 
many collaterals. 

1. The firft that we meet with was John de Skelton, who was knight of the 
(hire for Cumberland, in the parliament holden at Lincoln in the 10 Ed. 2. 

2. Adam de Skelton reprefented the faid county in parliament in the 12 Ed. 2.

6. Clement de Skelton was knight of the (hire in the 2, 6, 17, and 20 Ric. 2.â€” 
In the 16th year of the fame king, Sir Robert de Mulcaftre lord of Hayton 
granted to Sir Clement de Skelton knight and Thomas de Skelton feveral lands 
in Threapland, Alderfcogh, and Blenerhaflet. He married Johanna daughter 
of Sir Giles de Orton. 

7. John de Skelton was member of parliament, for the courjr.y in the 3d and 8th,

to Sir John Skelton knight feveral lands in Whitrigg and Torpenhow ; to 
which grant Richard Skelton then fherirfof Cumberland was a witnefs l This

8. John Skelton efquire was fheriffof the county in the 10th, 19th, 24th, and 
29th of Hen. 6. and reprefented the faid county in parliament in the 28 Hen. 6. 

He was retained by Humphrey duke of Gloucefter to ferve him in the wars. 

For by a deed in the 2d year of Hen. 6. the duke grants to him an annuity of 
20/, on condition to ferve him in the wars during life. The duke's ftyle in 
this grant is fomewhat particular ; it begins " Humfridus regum filius, frater, 
" et patruus â€¢, dux Gloceftrias ; comes Hannonise, Hollands, Zeelandiai, and 
Â«' Penibrochias ; dominus Frifias â€¢, et magnus camerarius Anglise."

ment in the 12 Ed. 4. 

10. John Skelton efquire was fherirT of Cumberland in the 3 Hen. 8. â€” In 
the 35 Hen. 8. it was found by inquificion, that John Skelton of Armethwaite 
held the capital meffuage of Armethwaite in the foreft of Inglewood, as a 
purprefture, with the appurtenances, of the king in capite, by the fervice of

11. William Skelton efquire, fon of John, married Anne daughter of John 
Leigh of I fall efquire, and died Aug. 29, in the 27 Eliz. And was fuc- 
ceeded by, 

12. Lancelot Skelton, his fon: And with him begins the pedigree certified at 
Sir William Dugdale's vifitation aforefaid. He married Catherine daughter of

Marmaduke; and two daughters, trances married to Thomas Warwick of 
Warwick hall efquire, and Mary married to John Simpfon of Grinfdale, . This i 
John Skelton died about the year 1652. 

14. Richard Skelton efquire, fon of John, married Lettice daughter of Bur- 
det of Bramcoat in the county of Warwick efquire, and filler of Sir Thomas 
Burdet baronet ; and by her had iffue John his fon and heir, and Philip who

15. John Skelton efquire, fon and heir of Richard, married Elizabeth 
daughter of Gerard Salvin of Croxdale in the county of Durham efquire, and

York, who died in 1727 ; and was fucceeded by Robert Sander/on his brother, 
who died in 1741, and left this eftate to his widow for life, and afterwards to 
his nephew William Milbcurne efquire, who dying without iffue devifed the 
fame to his fifter Mrs. Margaret Milbourne for life, and after her deceafe to his 
coufin german Mr. Robert Milbourne of Newcaftle upon Tyne merchant, and 
his iffue male. 

The Arms of Skelton are ; Azure, a fefs between 3 flower de luces Or. 

Richard Skelton, grandfather of the laft Richard, by his will dated in 
1668 gave 100/ for the endowment of a chapel here at Armathwaite, after he 
had firft built the faid chapel. But it is fuppofed it had been an ancient cha- 
pel long before his time, and that he only rebuilt it. And one Chriftopher 
Rickerby, who was curate at this chapel foon after the faid endowment, in a 
kind of poem intitled " An elegy upon the death of that virtuous old gentle- 
" man Richard Skelton efquire late of the caftle of Armathwaite in the 
'[ county of Cumberland," fays, 

He did rebuild a chapel which will be 

A monument of his fidelity. 

I heard this worthy perfon often fay 

He walk'd unto his chapel on a day, 

And beads were lying in't (ere he begun) 

To (hade them from the fcorching of the fum 

This prick'd his tender heart, that when, oh! when 

He faw the temple of the Lord a den, 

Then he in hafte confidered where to find 

Workmen to build according to his mind. 

His purfe cried plenty, when he thought upon 

The building up again of mount Sion, &c. 

It is a very neat fabrick, the quire part efpecially, being handfomely wain- 
fcotted about. 

Befides the intereft of the faid 100/, it hath been augmented with 200/ 
by the governors of queen Anne's bounty in conjunction with 100/ given 
by Mr. Brown aforefaid, and 100/ by the countefs dowager Gower j which 

fums 



LEETH WARD. (Hesket.) 343 

fums were laid out in a purchafe of lands in the parifhes of Lazonby and 
Ainftable, of the prefent yearly value of 26/. 

Nunclose alfo lies wirhin this parifh of Hefket, which king William Rufus 
in the fecond year of his reign granted to the priorefs and nuns of Ermith- 
waite in the following words : " Ducentas et fexdecim acras terras, exiftentes 
" infra foreftam noftram de Ingelwode, jacentes ex parte boreali cujufdam 
** aquse vocatse Tarnwadelyn, cum omnibus proficuis et commoditatibus." 
And king Edward the fourth in the 13th year of his reign, regranted and 
confirmed the fame to the faid houfe â€” " Et fpecialiter, cujufdam antiqui 
" claufi vocati Le Nonne clofe." 

After the diffolution of the religious houfes, Nunclofe was granted by Ed. 
6. in the 6th year of his reign to William Greyme alias Carlyfle gentleman, 
in whofe family it continued for feveral defcents ; and was afterwards con- 
veyed to John Pattenfon gentleman, who fold it to Sir John Lowther of 
Lowther baronet, who in 1695 granted the fame in exchange for other lands 
to Chriftopher Dalfton of Acorn Bank efquire, in whofe family it remained 
till 1762, when it was fold by Sir William Dalfton knight to William Mil- 
bourne of Armathwaite caftle efquire, who devifed the fame to his fifter Mrs. 
Margaret Milbourne for life, and after her deceafe to his kinfman (as aforefaid) 
Robert Milbourne of Newcaflle upon Tyne merchant. 

It is now deemed a manor of itfelf, and is ftyled the manor of Armathwaite 
otherwife Nunclofe; and confifts of one freeholder who pays yearly is freer 
rent, and 17 cuftomary tenants who pay yearly 4/ 10s cuftomary rent, and gs 
yearly in lieu of boon days. The fines upon the death of lord or tenant are 
twenty penny, upon alienations arbitrary. 

At Armathwaite caftle, in Mr. Machel's time, was a broad fword, with a 
bafket hilt : On one fide of the blade was this infcription, GDWARDVS ; on 
the other fide, PRINS ANGLI6. It was probably left there in king Edward 
the firft's time, at which place the prince might lodge, when his father's head 
quarters were at Lanercoft. 

In the church of Hefket, on the north wall, over a feat belonging ta 
Ellerton and Hayclofe is the following monumental infcription :

Of this Bernard Kirkbride (the lafl of his name and family) the following pe- 
digree was certified by himfelf at Sir William Dugdale's vifitation in 1665: 

1. Richard Kirkbride of Ellerton efquire, married Eleanor daughterof Edmund 
Cliburne of Cliburne in Weftmorland, and by her had iflfue Bernard and Ran- 
dal, the latter of whom lived at Newbiggin in Cumberland. 

2. Bernard Kirkbride efquire, fon and heir of Richard, married Dorothy 
daughter of Edmund Dudley of Yanewith in the county of Weftmorland ; 
and had iflue (1) Richard. (2) Chrifiopher, who died unmarried. (3) Cliburne 
Kirkbride, a merchant at Newcaftle upon Tyne, who died without i(fue. (4) 
Ifabel, married to John Saunderfon of Newcaftle upon Tyne. This Bernard 
died about the year 1622. 

3. Richard Kirkbride of Ellerton efquire, fon and heir of Bernard, was 
colonel of a regiment of foot in the fervice of king Charles the firft, under 
the command of William marquis of Newcaftle. He married Bridget 
daughter of Edward Mayplate prebendary in the cathedral church of Carlifle; 
and by her had iflue (1) Bernard. (2) Mary, married to William Graham of 
Nunnery. (3) Barbara, married to Leonard Barow of Ainftable. He died 
in 1659. 

4. Bernard Kirkbride of Ellerton efquire, fon and heir of Richard, was 
lieutenant colonel to Sir Henry Fetherftonhaugh knight in the fervice of the 
faid king Charles the firft. He married Jane eldeft daughter of Sir Timothy 
Fetherftonhaugh of Kirk Ofwald knight (and filler of Sir rienry) ; was of 
the age of 36 at the faid vifitation ; and died (as his epitaph above exprefieth) 
in 1677 without iflue. 

Adjoining to the churchyard a little fcho:l hath been erected ; which had 
an ancient endowment by the annual intereft of 40/-, and was augmented as 
aforefaid by Mr. Brown with the fum of 200/. 

At Hefket yearly on St. Barnabas's day, by the highway fide under a thorn 
tree (according to the very ancient manner of holding aiTemblies in the open 
air), is kept the court for the whole foreft of Englewood ; to which court the 
feveral manors within that vaft circumference (above twenty in number) owe 
fuic and fervice â€¢, and a jury is there impannelled and fworn for the whole 
foreft. It is a fhadow or relick of the ancient foreft courts ; and here they 
pay their compositions for approvements, purpreftures, agiftments, and future 
of the forefters â€¢, and the jurors being obliged to attend from the feveral ma- 
nors, feerns to be part of that fervice which was called witnefman. 

-In 1730 there were in this parifh 269 families; of which prefby.terians 6, 
and papifts 2. 

The hamlets of Brathwait and Middlesceuch are deemed part of the 
parifh of St. Mary's Carlifle â€¢, but they lie in Leeth Ward. They confift of 
about 25 tenements, and pay a yearly quit rent of 16 1 3 J 4^d to Henry 
Brougham efquire of Scales hall. They adjoin to the parifhes of Dalfton 
northwards, Hefket eaft, Hutton and Skelton ibuth, and Caftle Sowerby weft.

PARISH OF SOWERBY. 

The parifh of Sowerby, or Cqflle Sowerby, lies wholly within tjse foreft of 
Englewood, and adjoins upon the parifhes of Dalfton on the north weft ; 
Sebergham and part of Caldbeck on the weft and fouth weft ; Grayftock on 
the fouth; Skelton, Hutton, and the hamlets of Brathwait and Middlefceugh. 
on the eaft. The tenants hold immediately of the duke of Portland lord of 
the faid foreft, and pay a copyhold yearly rent, and a fine of one penny only 
upon change of tenant by death or alienation, and nothing upon the death of 
the lord. The tenants alio have the wood. The land defcends to coheir- 
efies â€¢, and the wife mull be privately examined and confeniing, otherwife 
fhe will have her thirds, notwithstanding any fale made by her hufband. 

In the 7 G. 3. an act of parliament was paffed for dividing and inclofing 
the common and feveral wafte grounds within this manor and parifh ; which 
being now effected, the faid feveral copyholders are thereby become free- 
holders. By the faid act, 55J acres are allotted to the dean and chapter of Car- 
lifle as appropriators, and 203 acres to the vicar, in lieu and perpetual dif- 
charge of all tithes rectorial and vicarial, a modus of 20 s out of Thiftlewood 
only excepted. And fo much of the faid common is ordered to be fold as 
will raife 700/, for inclofing and erecting proper houfes upon the faid. two al- 
lotments. And one eighth part of the remainder (viz. 470 acres) is affigned, 
to the lord, with a refervation of the royalties and feigniory. 

The church is dedicated to St. Mungo or Kentigern. It is fituate at the 
very extremity of the parifh ; the reafon of which probably might be, as in 
many other like inftances, that the founder (who was moft commonly the 
lord of the manor) did inhabit nigh thereunto. And to this day we fee in 
abundance of parifhes the church and manor-houfe to be nearly contiguous. 

In 1294 (which was the 22d year of king Edward the firft of England) 
John BaHol king of Scots prefented a clerk to the rectory of Sowerby, being 
vacant by the removal of the late rector Richard de Wytton to the church of 
Hawyk in the diocefe of Glafgow. The form of whofe prefentation is fome- 
what remarkable : â€” " Johannes Dei gratia rex Scotorum, venerabili in Chrifto 
patri ac amico fuo quamplurimum confidenti domino Johanni eadem gratia 
Carliolenfi epifcopo, falutem et finceram in domino charitatem et dilectio-

In June following, the famous Anthony Beck, bifhop of Durham, prefents 
a clerk, by virtue of a grant from the faid king of Scotland ; whofe prefen- 
tation is'nolefs remarkable than the former: â€” " Venerabili in Chrifto patri

think this church, whilft it continued a rectory, was very confiderable ; fince

12. Robert his fon fucceeded, and died in the year following, viz. 10 Ed. 2. 
By an inquifition taken at Carlifle on Monday next before the feaft of St. Barna- 
bas in that year, the jurors find, that Robert fon of Ralph de Grayftock died 
feized of the manor of Grayftock with the appurtenances, holden of the king 
in capite by homage and the fervlce of 4.I per annum for cornage : That the faid 
manor is worth by the year in all iffues at this time 62/ 1 3 j gd ob. q. and no 
more, becaufe it is deftroyed by the Scots : But before thefe times, in time of 
peace, it was ufually worth in all iffues 200 marks. He married Elizabeth 
daughter of Neville of Stainton in the county of Lincoln â€¢, and had iffue,

ing in the caftle of Mitford for treafon. 

14. William his fon was very young at his father's death, for he had not 
livery of his lands till the 16 Ed. 3. â€” He obtained the king's licence to make 
a caftle of his manor houfe at Grayftock. He built alfo the caftle of Morpeth. 
He married firft Lucy daughter of the lord Lucy, from whom he was divorced ;

deLucy lord of Cockermouth, Roger lord Clifford of Appleby caftle ; Henry 
le Scrope, and Thomas Mufgrave fenior, knights ; the prior of Carlifle, and 
the abbots of Holm Cultram and Shap. This was in the 32 Ed. 3-f-. And 
in the 'chancel of Grayftock church is this monumental infeription : " Icy gft

daughter of Roger lord Clifford Â£. He had the direction of the military expe- 
dition againft the Scots in the 4 Ric. 2. when he was taken prifoner at Horfridge 
in Glendale by George earl of Dunbar. His brother William went as an hof- 
tage for him to Dunbar, where he died of a fever. His ranfom coft 3000 
marks, which feems to have been raifed by way of affeffment on his tenants, for 
thereunto the burgeffes of Morpeth paid for their proportion 7/ 13 s 10 d.â€”> 
He died in the 6 Hen. 5. 

16. John lord Grayftock, fon of Ralph, was of the age of 28 at the death of

in the 2 Hen. 7. He had only one child Robert Grayftock knight, who married 
Elizabeth daughter of Edmund Gray duke of Kent, and died before his father, 
in the 3 Ric. 3. leaving only an infant daughter Elizabeth. â€” And thus ended the 
male line of the lords of Grayftock; and the inheritance was transferred by 
marriage of the heirefs into another family. 

There was at that time a very confiderable and ancient family at Dacre in 
Cumberland of the name of Dacre ; who, to their paternal inheritance had 
received a large addition by marriage of the heirefs of Mutton, whofe anceftor 
had married the heirefs of Vaux (de Vallibus, of Gilfland,) and was defcended 
from a daughter and coheir of Morvil, whofe anceftor had married the heirefs of 
Engain, who married the heirefs of Trivers, who married a fifter of Ranulph de 
Mefchiens fo often mentioned, to whom William the Conqueror gave Cumber- 
land. Of this family, Thomas lord Dacre ofGiLSLAND married the laid 
Elizabeth baronefs of Grayftock and Wemm, in the 22 Hen. 7. in which year 
fhe had fpecial livery of her lands. He was fon of Humphrey de Dacre, who fuc- 
ceeded to the Gilfland and Grayftock eftar.es as heir mal- of the family by intail ;

The faid three fifters, coheirs of George lord Dacre, Sir William Dugdale 
fays, were married by their father-in-law the duke of Norfolk to his three fons 
by his former wives. It is probable enough the duke intended fo to do ; but the 
ffcond fifter died. The eldeft fifter Anne was married to the faid duke's eldefl 
Ion Philip earl of Arundel, and the third fifter Elizabeth was married to the faid 
duke's third ion the lord William Howard^ and divided the inheritance between 
them. (The fecond fon of the faid duke of Norfolk, the lord Thomas Howard^

The lord William Howard^ with his wife the lady Elizabeth^ fettled at the Dacre

Howard earl of Arundel, with his wife the lady Anne, fettled at the Dacre eftate ac 
Grayftock, in whofe name and family it ftill continues f. And this renders it 
neceffary to deduce the hiftory of this illuftrious family. 

I. Thefiift was an eminent and learned lawyer (as many of the great families

The church of Grayftock is dedicated to St. Andrew, and is rectorial, valued 
in the king's books at 40/ ys 8^d t and now worth upwards of 300/ per 
annum. 

In the year 1302, Mr. Richard de Morpeth was inftituted to this church,, 
upon the prefentation of Sir John de Grayftock knight. 

In 1 3 14, Ralph de Erghome, an acolite, was prefented by Ralph fon of 
William lord of Grayftock, and inftituted thereupon, with a difpenfation for 
four years abfence at his ftudies. He had afterwards no fewer than five difpen- 
fations of abfence, and feems indeed never to have refided there at all. And 
after he had been rector here above 40 years, he refigned the rectory, on his 
being inftituted into the living of Foulftowe in the diocefe of Lincoln, in 
the year 1357, and thereupon Richard de Hoton Roof was prefented by Sir 
William de Grayftock knight-, who immediately, upon his inftitution, took 
out a commiffion of inquiry into the dilapidations in the parfonage houfe and 
chancel, occafioned by the long non-reudence of his predecefTor. 

In 1359, there is a confirmation by bifhop Welton of a grant made by the 
faid William lord of Grayftock, to one mafter and 6 chaplains, viz. Sir 
Richard de Hoton (then rector) mafter or cuftos, Andrew de Brifcoe, Richard 
de Brampton, William de Wanthwaite, Robert de Threlkeld, and William 
de Hill, chaplains. 

In 1365, on the death of Richard de Hoton, inftitution was given to John 
de Herinthorp prieft, who was prefented by king Ed. 3. in right of his ward 
Ralph baron of Grayftock then a minor. 

In 1377, on the petition of the faid Ralph de Grayftock, fetting forth that 
the income of that reclory is very confiderable, and the cure ill fupplied, the 
bifhop iflues out a commiffion of inquiry : and thecommiffioners return (amongft' 
other particulars) that the yearly revenues of the reclory of Grayftock amount 
to about 100/, out of which deductions being made for procurations and other 
ecclefiaftical duties, the parfon may clear about 80 /. That there are feveral 
chapels in the parifh; one at Wethermelock, 3 miles from the parifh church ; 
and another, 4 miles diftant, at Threlkeld -, that each of thefe hath a cha- 
plain and a chapel clerk (clericum aqua; bajulum); that the parifh is 7 miles' 
long, and 4 broad. 

In 1379, another commiffion of inquiry, to the fame purpofe, is fent by 
the bifhop to his official, who makes retarn (upon the oaths of the jury, con- 
fiftirig of an equal number of ecclefiaftics and laymen thereupon fummoned) 
that it would be for the honour of God and the good of the parifhioners, to 
have more clergymen to officiate in that large parifh. 

In the fame year, Sir John de Clajlon the rector had a difpenfation for two 
years abfence, with allowance to let his rectory to farm for that term. 

In 1382, the mother church of Grayftock being much out of repair, the 
walls crazy, the bellfry fallen, and the wooden fhingles on the roof moftly 
Scattered, and the inhabitants of Threlkeld^ and Wethermelock refufing to 
contribute their proportion of the charge; the bifhop, at his ordinary vifita- 
tion, hTues out his injunction to all and every of them under pain o* the 
greater excommunication.

In the fame year, Alexander (Nevil) archbifhop of York, the pope's legate, 
converts the re&ory of Grayftock into a college; whereof he conftitutes Gil- 
bert Bcvwtt prieft the firft mafler ; and gives the chantry of St. Andrew in the 
faid church ro John Lake of the diocefe of Litchfield, the chantry of St. Mary 
to Thomas Chamberlayne of the diocefe of Norwich, the chantry of the altar 
of St. John Baptift to John Alve of the diocefe of York, the chantry of the 
altar of St. Katherine to Richard Carvvell of the diocefe of Lincoln, the chan- 
try of St. Thomas the martyr (meaning Eecket) to Robert Newton of the 
diocefe of Litchfield, and (laftly) the chantry of the altar of St. Peter to John 
de Hare of the diocefe of York: and all thefe were obliged at their inftalment 
to fwear canonical obedience to the bifhops of Carlifle, in like manner as the 
rectors of Grayftock had been before accuftomed to do. 

In 1 3S6, upon the death of Thomas Chambcrlayne, Adam de Aglionby 
was inftituted into the chantry of the altar of St. Mary in the collegiate church 
of Grayftock, being thereunto preferred by the noble lord Ralph baron of 
Grayftock. 

In 1.420", Adam de Aglionby appears to be then mafter of the college of Gray- 
ftock ; being fued in that year by William Rebanks and his wife for fome 
lands in Raughton. 

In 1526, died JohnWkel-pdale,\A.j. D. mafter of the college of Grayftock 
and rector of Caldbeck ; as appears from his epitaph in the church of Gray- 
ftock. 

Not long after, the monafteries, collegiate churches, and chantries were 
diffolved. At which time, the revenues of the feveral chantries aforefaid in 
this church were twenty nobles a year to each. Afterwards it was difputed 
whether the church did continue rectorial, or the rectory and profits thereof 
became vefted in the crown by the faid difiblution. For the incumbent it was 
alledged, that he was pofTefTcd by prefentation, admiffion, inftitution, and in- 
duction : That the church was indeed made collegiate, but it was by the pope's 
authority only: That they had no common feal, and therefore were not a le- 
gal corporation. And judgment was ^iven againft the king-, and the church 
continued re&orial and parochial. â€” Judge Dyer, who reports this cafe, feems 
10 lay the ftrefs upon the want of a common feal*. Lord Coke lays the ftrefs 
upon its being made collegiate by the pope's authority only, without the king's 
aflent-j-. (Either of them fufficient. arguments of the invalidity of the efta- 
blifnWnt.) 

In 1567, on the death of Mr. 'John Dacre rector of Grayftock, inftitution 
was given to Sir Simon Mojfe clerk prefented by Thomas duke of Norfolk 
earl marfhal of England and knight of the garter and Elizabeth his wife (wi- 
dow of Thomas late lord Dacre). 

In the next year, on the death of Simon MoiTe, Mr, Edward Han/by was 
inftituted, on a prefentation by queen Elizabeth in right of her ward George 
lord Dacre fon and heir of Thomas lord Dacre, Grayftock, and Gilfland. 

In 15X4, Mar 6. on the death of Mr. Hanfby, one caveat was entred by 
Francis Dacre of Croglin efquire, claiming the patronage of the rectory of

Jn purfuance of which verdict, IJugh Thornly, M. A. was inftituted into the' 
faid rectory on the 30th of January following, on the prefentation of William 
Cantrell efquire. And nine years after, the laid Hugh Thornly was again in- 
ftituted on a prefentation from the queen, to prevent any hazard, by la pie or' 
otherwile, in the former title, 

In 1^97, Mr. Leonard Lczvtber had inftitution on the death of Hugh 
Thornly, being prefented by Richard Lowther of Lowther efquire,- by virtue 
of a grant of the prefent avoidance from the queen (the earl of Arundel the 
patron being then under attainder). 

In 1616, a cauie was determined (ps appears from lord Hobart's Report?,. 
p. 107.) between the bifhop of Carlille as rector of Grayftock (having that 
living in Commendam), and one of his parifhioners ; wherein the bifhop re- 
covered a fight of the wool in tithing. This bifhop (according to the courfe 
of chronology) was Dr. Henry Robinjon.

In 1639, William Morland, M. A. was prefented by the fame patron. In 
1650. he was ejected for ignorance and infufneiency by Sir Arthur Hazlerig 
and rather cornmiffioners for propagating the gofpel in the four northern coun- 
ties â€¢, which fentence, upon Mr. Morland's appeal, was confirmed by the com- 
mittee for plundered minifters. He was firft fucceeded by one Weft, who died 
in about two years time. After him came Dr. Gilpin, who delivered up the 
rectory to Mr. Morland on king Charles the fecond's restoration *. 

In 1663, on Mr. Morland's death, Alan Smallwcod, D. D. was prefented by 
Jofhua Colfton of London, M. D. by virtue of a grant from Elizabeth coun-

In 1692, a caveat was entered on behalf of the univerfity of Cambridge, 
claiming by their right of presenting as to a popifh living; and on Mr. 
Fowke's death, Thomas Gibbon, M. A, was inftituted on their prefentation. In

Hutton John, within this parifh, for a long time was the property of a 
family of the name of Hutton*, defcended from a younger brother, very pro- 
bably, of the Huttons of Hutton in this county. From what John in par- 
ticular it received this appellation, we have not found. In the 36 Edw. 3. it 
is found by inquifition, that William de Hoton John held the manor of Hoton 
John of the barony of Grayftock, by homage and 20 s cornage, with fuit of 
court at Grayftock from three weeks to three weeks, and by the fervice called 
witnefman and puture of the forefters of Flafcowe.

When king Charles the fecond lay upon his death-bed, he adminiftred to him 
the facraments according to the rites of the church of Rome -, which when 
he had finifhed, and pronounced the abfolution, the king fcemed at great 
cafe, and turning to the reverend father, exprefied his thanks in thefe remark- 
able words : " You have faved me twice ^ Firft, my body after the fight at 
Worctfter, And now my foul." And afked if he would have him declare 
himfelf of that church ? To which the father anfwered, that he would take 
upon himfelf to fatisfy the world in that particular. After king James the 
fecond came to the crown, he caufed father Hudlefton to areft and publifh to 
the world, that the late king Charles the fecond died a catholic, and that he 
gave him the Eucharift and Extreme Unction. And therewith he publifhed 
two papers found in the late king's ftrong box, all of his own handwriting, 
tending to prove the neceffity of a vifible church and guide in matters of 
faith â€¢, together with a little treatife called " A fhort and plain way to the 
faith and church," which father Hudlefton fays was written by his uncle 
Richard Hudlefton [7th fon of Andrew abovementioned] of the Englifh con- 
gregation of the order of St. Benedict ; which treatife, the father affirms, 
made great impreffion upon the mind of Charles the fecond, whillt he fecreted 
him from the fearch of the rebels at Bofcobel afcer the battle of Worccfter.â€” - â–  
For thefe and other faithful fervices, this reverend father had an appointment 
in the queen dowager's palace at Somerfet houfe, where he had the fuperin- 
tendency of the chapel, and alfo had a handfome penfion fettled upon him for 
life. Both which he enjoyed quite through the rejgns of king James the 
fecond and king William, and till the 3d year of queen Anne, 1704, when 
he died, being of the age of g6 years, and was buried in the body of that 
chapel. He expended the greateft part of his income and effects in rebuild- 
ing the chapel of the Englifh college at Doway aforefaid, and endowing feveral 
new fcholarfhips there, and in the abbey or convent of Lambfpring in Weft- 
phalia; and at his death, by will, left the refiduum of his effects to the (popifh) 
lord Feverfham, in truft to fee thofe undertakings finifhed. 

Andrew Hudleston of Hutton John efquire, eldeft fon of Jofeph, mar- 
ried Dorothy fecond daughter of Daniel Fleming of Skirwith efquire, and by 
her had iffue 4 fons, Andrew, Jofeph, John, and Richard -, and five daughters, 
Mary, Jane, Dorothy, Magdalene, a"nd Bridget. 

This family fuffered greatly for their loyalty and fervices to king Charles 
the firft and fecond, from Oliver Cromwell, who caufed all their manors and 
pofTeffions in the counties of Oxford, Lancafter, and Weflmorland to be 
feized and fold, or otherwife difpofed of amongft his partizans. So that the 
family had little or nothing left except the eftate at Hutton John (being under 
fettlement on the marriage of the faid Andrew and Dorothy), which was for 
many years under fequeftration, and not reftored until the return of king 
Charles the fecond, when they got this eftate again, but no recompence for

Andrew Hudleston of Hutton John efquire, eldeft fori of Andrew and 
Dorothy, was the firft proteftant of the family : He was a man of great 
learning and parts, much refpected in the county, and a zealous promoter 
of the Revolution. In October 1688, being informed of a {hip put into 
"Workington, loaded with arms and ammunition intended for king James the 
fecond's garrifon of Carlifle, he immediately went over to confult Sir John 
Lowther of Lowther, who was alfo extremely afFefted to the Revolution, how 
they might feize and fecure the (hip and loading for the ufe of the prince of 
Orange, who was then daily expected to land. It was agreed to make the 
attempt, by immediately arming their fervants and tenants, and mounting 
them on horfeback to march privately in the night, fo as to be ready for the 
attack by break of day the next morning. This was fo happily effected, that 
after very little refiftance, the crew furrendered, and the (hip, arms, and am- 
munition were all taken and fecured for the prince of Orange. This was 
one of the firft open acts of hoftility againft king James the fecond in favour 
of the Revolution, but had like to have coft the parties dear. For they had 
fcarce got home, when news arrived of the prince of Orange's fleet being 
difperfed in a ftorm and obliged to put back, and of having received fo much 
damage, that the prince could not purfue his enterprize till next fpring. 
This advice gave the parties fome uneafinefs for a few days. But the damage 
to the fleet was fo foon repaired, that on the firll of November it put to tea 
again, and on the 5th arrived at Torbay, and the prince's landing happily ef- 
fected before night. 

This Andrew married Katharine daughter of Sir Wilfrid Lawfon of Ifell 
baronet, and by her had iflue fix fons, viz. Andrew (who died before his 
father without iflue), Wilfrid, William, Richard, Lawfon, and John ; and 9 
daughters, Dorothy., Jane, Katharine, Elizabeth, Mary, Anne, Judith, and 
Bridget.

wen, minifter of the old church in Whirehaven, and rector of Clifton in 
Weftmorland ; who married to his firft wife Elizabech filter of Richard Cooke 
of Workington efquire, and by her had iflue a daughter Joyce married to 
William Shammon efquire a lieutenant in the royal navy : He married to his

of this county in the year 1769, is (like the reft) part of the barony of Gray- 
ftock ; and i3 commonly called Newkirk parifh, probably from a chapel 
having been erecled there, which was confecrated by bifhop Oglethorp in the 
year 1558 : It hath the parochial rights of baptifm and burial; and is endow- 
ed with a dwelling houfe and outhoufes, with about ten acres of land; worth 
about 7/ a year; a prefcriptive payment out of 66 tenements amounting to 
61 ws 4a 1 , out of which is paid yearly to the rector of Grayftock 2/; fur-

To the curate of this chapel there are 34 tenements that pay yearly 2; 6d

and it hath had two allotments of 200/ each of queen Anne's bounty, and

Threlkeld 



LEETH WARD, (Threlkeld.) 373 

Threlkeld is another chapelry and manor within the barony and parifh of 
Grayftock. It belonged to a family who took their name from thence, who 
had alfo porTeflions at Yanwith and Crofby Ravenfworth in Weftmorland. 

So early as ihe reign of king Ed. i. Henry de Threlkeld obtained a grant of 
free warren in his eftates in Weftmorland (the like having probably been ob- 
tained before for t.t family eftate at Threlkeld). He appears to have had 
the fame grant renewed in the 14 Ed. 2. â€” Neverthelefs, in the 11 Ed. 2. we 
find that John de Derwentwater held this vill of the lord of Grayftock, by 
homage and fuit of court at Grayftock ; which feems to have been only by 
way of truft in a fettlement. 

In the 30 Ed. 3. William de Threlkeld was owner of this manor under the 
Grayftccks, and in the fame year was fheriff of the county of Cumberland.. 
In the 40th of the fame king, he paid a relief for a moiety of Yanwith, which 
he held of the barony of Grayftock. In the 13 Ric. 2. William de Threlkeld 
was member of parliament for this county. 

This William feems to have been fucceeded by a collateral of the fame 
name : For in the 5 Hen. 4. William Threlkeld then lord of Crofby Ravenf- 
worth, coufin and heir of William Threlkeld knight, father of William Threl- 
keld of Ulvefby, fon of John, fon of William^ paid his relief for two parts of 
the moiety of the manor of Ulvefby. 

In the 10 Hen. 6. an agreement was made between Sir Henry Threlkeld 
knight lord of the manor of Threlkeld and the rector of Grayftock, concern- 
ing the appointment of a curate of the chapel of Threlkeld (as is herein after 
more particularly expreffed). 

In the reign of Ed. 4. Lancelot Threlkeld married Margaret dau&hter and 
heir of Henry Bromfktt lord Vefcy widow of John lord Clifford ; and by- 
he r had iffue, 

Sir Lancelot Threlkeld knight, who had three daughters coheirs ; one mar- 
ried to Thomas Dudley, with whom he had Yanwith ; another married to 
James Pickering, with whom he had Crofby Ravenfworth ; and the third 
Winifred, married to William Pickering, brother of the faid James (and both 
of them fons of Sir James Pickering of Killington in Weftmorland), with 
whom he had Threlkeld. 

The faid William Pickering feems to have had a fon Chriftopher Pickering 
knight, who was fheriff of Cumberland in the ^ Eliz. and the 4th and 6th 
of James the firft. 

It is faid the hall and demefne went with a daughter to the Irtons, whofe 
defcendent James Spedding of Armathwaite efquire now (1769) enjoys the 
fame. The manor and tenants were fold to the Lowthers of Lowther ; and 
in the year \6% -, June 16, Sir John Lowther of Eowther and John Lowther 
efquire his fon and heir apparent, in confederation of 1^60/ agreed with the 
tenants for a four penny fine certain â€¢, the number of tenants fpecified in the 
indenture and decree were 30, and 8 cottagers. The total of the rent is 30/ 
lbs <\d ; befides a free or quit rent of is 11 d paid by a few of the tenants to 
the lord of Grayftock. Each tenant here was obliged to find half a draught 
for one day ploughing j one day mowing; one day {hearing ; one day clip- 
ping* 



374 LEETH WARD. (Threlkeld.) 

:ping, and one day falving fheep ; one carriage load once in two years, but 
not to go above ten miles ; to dig and lead two loads of peats every year : 
The tenants to have fufficient meat and drink when they performed thefe fer- 
vices. The cottagers to perform the fame fervices, only inftead of half a 
plough, they were to find one horfe with a harrow, and a footman inftead of 
a carriage load. The tenants are alfo bound to the lord's miln, pay the 
fortieth corn, and to maintain the wall and thatch of the miln to the louder. 
The tenants to have hbufe boot, to be fet out by the lord's bailiff-, peats, 
turves, ling, whins, limeftones, and marie, with ftones and flates for build- 
ing. â€” But about thirteen years ago, half of the tenants bought off thefe fer- 
vices at five guineas each tenement ; the miln fervice only excepted The 

widow has the whole eftate during her chafte viduity. The tenements pay id 
yearly each as greenhue rent. 

There has been a chapel here of ancient time : And in the year 143 1, there 
was a reference to bifhop Lumley, by the rector or mafter and chaplains of 
the collegiate or parifh church of Grayftock on the one part, and Sir Henry 
Threlkeld knight lord of the manor of Threlkeld and his lay tenants on the 
other parr, concerning the appointment of a curate in the church or chapel 
of Threlkeld, and the manner of tithing corn and hay, and concerning other 
things tithable, within the lordfhip of Threlkeld aforefaid : Whereupon, the 
bifhop awards, and at the requeft of both the faid parties decrees for ever to 
be obferved, that upon a vacancy of the curacy, the faid Sir Henry Threlkeld 
and his heirs, with the advice of his tenants, fhall within one month nominate 
a curate to the rector or mafter aforefaid, who fhall within fix days admit him 
if he finds him fufficient â€¢, if he finds him infufficient, he fhall then fend him 
to the bifhop or his official principal, for further examination ; and if they 
find him infufficient, then the rector or mafier, with confent of his chaplains, 
fhall for that time nominate one to the bifhop within ten days after the rejec-' 
tion of the former ; and if the bifhop finds this latter fufficient, he fhall ad- 
mit him â€¢, otherwife, the bifhop fhall have the nomination for that turn only : 
â€” And that the rector or mafter fhall receive all the tithes, great, fmall, and 
mixed, within the faid lordfhip, except the tithes of corn and hay ; and that 
he fhall pay in lieu of the tithes of corn and hay to the curate aforefaid 3/ iys 
10 d; and over and above the fame, the fum of 12 s yearly*. 

This chapel enjoys all parochial rights ; and was certified in the year 1720 
to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 8 / 16 s 6d, and in the year 1747 
received an augmentation of 20Â©/ by lot, wherewith lands were purchafed 
nigh Kendal of the prefent yearly value of 61 10 s. 

Grisedale, ox Mungrifedale, is another chapelry within this parifh. The 
hamlet is holden, like many of the reft, of the lords of Grayftock. The 
chapel is endowed with a dwelling houfe, and a fmall enclofure wherein it ftands.

Johnbv, in this parifh, is a fmall demefne and manor, which formerly be- 
longed to the Mufgraves of Hayton, who gave it to a younger fon, whofe 
heir female married one Mr. Wyvil of the county of York, who fold it to Mr. 
Williams, who came out of Wales and was fteward at Grayftock caftle ; who 
had four daughters coheirs, the elded of whom was married to Sir Edward 
Hafel knight, who for her purparty had Johnby ; the fecond married to John 
Winder of Lorton counfellor at law, father to the late Williams Winder of 
Dufton efquire ; the third to Mr. Relph of Cockermouth ; and the fourth to 
Dr. Gibbon dean of Carlifle. 

Of this Mr. Williams there is the following epitaph in Grayftock church :

L11 tle Blencow gives name to a family which is of ancient ftanding in thefe 
parts. Their firft feat was at Great Blencow dole by, but on the other fide of the 
river Petterell, where they ftill have a demefne ; and where the ruins of an 
old tower are to be feen. The prelent manfion houfe, within this parifh of 
Grayftock, was purchafed from the family of Lyddal. Here is a ruinous 
chapel, with a yard belonging to it, in the midft whereof is a large receiver 
for pure fpring water which bubbles up plentifully in the bottom of it, and 
probably was ufed in former times as a baptiftery. Over the door are the 
arms of Blencow cut in ftone, viz. Azure, a bend Argent charged with three 
chaplets of Rofes Gules; with this motto, Quorfum vivere mori, mori vilaf. 

Near 

f This is according to the blazoning of their arms in the heralds office,, and to the blazoning 
exhibited by Mr. Machel from a vifitation of Cumberland in 1580. But from the original grant 
of thefe arms by the lord Grayftock in the 30 Ed 3. it appears that the colours have been mif- 
taken. Which grant, being curious (as proving the power of the great barons to grant arms ia 
ancient times) it is thought proper here to fubjoin, " To all to whom thefe prefer.ts fhall come

The parifh of Dacre confifts of the hamlets or conftablewicks of Dacre,

Dacre, who continued there for many ages. It is mentioned by Bede, as 
Jiaving a monaftery there in his time â€¢, as alfo by Malmefbury, for being

the place where Conftantine king of the Scots and Eugenius king of Cumber- 
land put themfelves and their kingdoms under the prote&ion of the Engliih 
king Athelftan. 

The true name of the family was D'' 'Acre, from one of them who ferved at 
the fiege of Acre (or Ptolemais) in the Holy-Land ; who from his achievements 
there having received the name of the place, imparted the fame at his return 
to his habitation in Cumberland. 

I. The firft of the name that hath occurred to us (who is one generation 
further back than in any. of the Dacre pedigrees that we have met with) was 
Ranulph de Dacre, lord of a moiety of the manor of Orton in Weftmorland ; 
who, with Thomas de Musgr ave owner of the other moiety, obtained a charter 
in the 6 Ed. i . for a market at Orton. The Dacres continued in the poflefiion of 
the faid moiety till the reign of king James the firft, when they fold the fame 
to the tenants. He had a fon and heir, 

II. William de Dacre knight; who married Joan daughter of Sir Wil- 
liam Buet knight. He died in the 12 Ed. 2. leaving iflue, 

III. Ranulph de Dacre â€¢, who married Margaret daughter and heir of 
Thomas de Multon lord of Gilfland, and who was in right of his wife the ninth

anceftor came to this barony by marriage of the heirefs of Vaux (de Vallibus) ; 
and was fon and heir of Ada one of the two daughters and coheirs of Sir Hugh 
de Morvil. Morvil's anceftor married the heirefs of Engain, who married the 
heirefs D'Eftrivers, whofe father Robert D'Eftrivers married a daughter of 
Ranulph de Mefchiens firft lord of Cumberland. â€” This Ranulph de Dacre 
died in the 13 Ed. 3. and Margaret his widow died in the 35th of the fame 
king. 

IV. William vi Dacre, eldeft fon of Ranulph by his wife Margaret, fuc- 
ceeded his father, but died in the life- time of his mother, without iflue ; and

leftor of the church of Preftecotes. Upon his mother's death he became the- 
tenth parliamentary lord of Gillefland. He died in the 49 Ed. 3. without iflue Â± 
and was fucceeded by the fourth brother, 

VII. Huch de Dacre, who died in the 7th of Ric. 2. leaving a fon and

eldeft fon, who died in his father's life-time, leaving only a daughter. 2. Ranulph, 
who (as his next heir male) fucceeded his father in the barony of Gillefland, as 
appears by the regifter book of Lanercoft, where he is ftyled the 14th parlia- 
mentary lord of Gillefland : He was (lain in the battle of Towton field, and 
died without iflue. 3. Humphrey, who fucceeded his brother Ranulph, and was

XVIII. Margaret, fitter and heir of Gregory lord Dacre, was married to . 
Samp/on Lennard of Chevening in Kentefquire. This Margaret laying claim to 
the title upon her brother's death, queen Elizabeth referred the matter to the 
lords Burleigh and Howard, to examine and inquire if her claim was good, 
which they both allowed it to be after mature confideration : but this affair not 
being quite finifhed before the queen's death, it was again laid before com- 
mifiioners appointed in the fucceeding reign -, and (he was then, in the 2 Ja. 1. 
allowed and declared baronefs Dacre. She died in the 9 Ja. 1. 

XIX. Henry Lennard lord Dacre, fon and heir of Sampfon Lennard and 
Margaret lady Dacre, married Chryfogona daughter of Richard Baker of Siffing- 
hurft in Kent-, by whom he had three fon s, Richard, Edward, and Fynes, 
whereof the two laft died without iffue -, and four daughters, Margaret, Penelope,

Sir Arthur Throgmorton, by whom- he had four fons, Francis, Richard, Tha-

Dorothy daughter of Dudley lord North, by whom he had a fon named Richard, 
who took the furname of Barret ; and a daughter Catharine wife of Chaloner 
Chute of the Vine inHampfhire. This Richard lord Dacre died in the 6 Cha. j. 
at his feat at Hurftmonceaujc, and was buried in the parifh church there. 

XXI. Francis lord Dacre married Elizabeth fifter and fole heir of Paul 
vifcount Bayning -, and had ifTue Thomas -, Francis who died a bachelor-, and 
Henry who left iflue Margaret, Anne, and Catharine -, and three daughters, 
Philadelphia married to Daniel Obrien vifcount Clare, Elizabeth married to John 
Barbafon earl of Meath, and Margaret who died unmarried. This Francis died 
in the 14 Cha. 2. and was buried at Chevening in Kent.. 

XXII. Thomas Lennard lord Dacre married the lady Anne Fitz-roy, natu- 
ral daughter of king Charles the fecond by Barbara duchefs of Cleveland, and 
in the 26 Cha. 2. was created earl of SufTex. He had ifTue two fons, Charles 
and Henry, who died in their infancy; and. two daughters Barbara and Anne, 
who were his heirs. He died in 17 15, and in the year following his widow 
and the faid two daughters fold Dacre and all other the premifes above-men- 
tioned in Cumberland and Weftmorland for the fum of 15,000/ to Sir Cbrijlo- 
pher Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet ; who foon after conveyed the caftle and 
manor of Dacre (inter alia) to Edward Hafrtl efquire the prefent proprietor. 

The title of lord Dacre, upon the death of the faid earl of SufTex, was held in 
abeyance between the two daughters, till the lady Barbara, who married Charles 
Skelton efquire a general officer in the fervice of the king of France, dying with- 
out ifTue in the year 1 740, the lady Anne her fifter then became fole heir to her 
father and lady Dacre. She married firft Richard Barret-Lennard efquire, to 
whom fhe had a fon Thomas Barret-Lennard the prefent lord Dacre. Her fe- 
cond hufband was Henry lord Teynham, to whom fhe had Charles who died 



LEETH WARD. (Dacre.) 3 Sz 

in 1755 leaving feveral children, and Henry a clergyman who married the 
daughter of William Chetwynd efquire, and a daughter Anne. 

The prefent lord Dacre was born in 1716, married Anne daughter of Sir 
John Pratt knight and fifter of the prefent lord Camden, and had ifiuea daugh- 
ter Anna Barbara who died in the year 1 749. 

The church of Dacre is dedicated to St. Andrew, and feems to have been 
appropriated to the monaftery which Bede fpeaks of as exifting there in his 
time, tho' there are now no veftiges thereof remaining, In pope Nicholas's 
Valor in 1291, the rectory and vicarage of Dacre are rated feparately, viz. the 
rectory at 50/, and the vicarage at 9/ 2s 8d. In Edward the fecond's Valor 
in 1318 they are eftimated as being united, viz. the church of Dacre with the 
vicarage 13I 6s Sd. As to the total annihilation of that monaftery, perhaps 
we need go no further than to the Scots to account for it. However, the 
church from the time not long after pope Nicholas's furvey appears to have 
been rectorial, and fo to have continued till late in the reign of king Henry the 
eighth, when (as tradition reports) it was given to the college of Kirk-Olwald 
and totally appropriated thereto. 

In 1296, on the death of Nicholas de Appleby the laft incumbent, Sir William 
de Daker prefents Henry de Harcla to the rectory of Dacre, to whom the bilhop 1 
firft grants the living by fequeftration, and afterwards gives him institution be- 
ing then a fubdeacon. Tho' ftyled clerk, yet he feems only to have been an 
acolite when firft prefented. 

In 1328, William de Burgh was rector of Dacre, and a truftee in a fettlement 
by the lord Dacre. 

In 1359, William Boivett rector of Dacre made his will, and therein bequeath- 
ed his body to be buried in the quire of St. Andrew's church in Daker j and 
was fucceeded by Walter de Loutheburgh^ on a prefentation by Sir William de 
Dacre. And the bifhop grants him a licence of three years abfence, making 
a decent allowance to a curate, and paying to the bifhop 10/ fterling each year 
for the faid licence.â€” In 1369 he exchanged his rectory with Peter de Stapilton 
rector of Waldnewton in the diocefe of Lincoln, with confent of the refpective 
patrons and ordinaries. And in the next year Peter exchanges with William de 
Orchards rector of Whitburn in the diocefe of Durham, who is prefented by 
Ranulph de Dacre lord of Gilftand. And the faid William de Orchards again 
refigns, in favour of John Ingelby. 

After the diftblutionof the religious houfes, John Brockbank in the year 1571 
was collated by the bifhop to the vicarage of Dacre, vacant by trie refuf.ii or 
neglect of Roland Daivfon the late vicar to fubfcribe the 39 articles according to 
act of parliament. 

In 1574, the fame bifhop (Barnes) collates Sir Richard Sutton clerk. 

In 1582, on the death of Richard Sutton, Sir William Martin was collated. 
In whofe time, viz. in 1586, a leafe of the rectory and tithes was granted by the 
crown to Thomas Hammond for 21 years, he paying to the vicar an annual fti- 
pend of 8. /, 

In

In 1 59 1, on the death of William Martin, Sir Thomas Wrae was collated by 
bifhop Meye. 

In 1742, William Richardfon clerk was prefented under the great feal, and 
inftituted accordingly. 

In 1768, on William Richardfon's death, William Ccivper, M. A. was infti- 
tuted on a like prefentation under the great leal. 

The aforefaid ftipend of 8/ a year was the whole endowment, until about the 
year 1669, when Mr. William Mawfon of Timpaurin gave by his will a leafe 
of the tithes of Slegill and Thrimby in Weftmorland to the vicars of Penrith 
and Dacre equally between them. The truftees, with confent of all parties, 
feparated the tithes, and the vicar of Penrith had the tithes of Slegill, and the 
vicar of Dacre the tithes of Thrimby, each in a diftinct leafe. This at firft was 
a considerable augmentation to the church of Dacre. But afterwards the village 
of Thrimby was moftly bought up by the firft lord vifcount Lonfdale, and 
the lands taken into Lowther park. Which leafe being fuffered to run out, the 
faid tithes were fold by the dean and chapter of Carlifle to the faid lord Lonfdale 
for 200/; which fum they gave in augmentation of the vicarage, unto which 
the governors of queen Anne's bounty gave 200/ more, wherewith lands were 
purchafed at Black Burton, of the preient yearly value of 21/. 

The church is a neat and elegant building ; and the tradition goes, that it 
was erected by the Dacres, inftead of a very mean one about half a mile diftant. 
(Perhaps out of the ruins of the monaftery above-mentioned.) 

On the north-fide of the communion table, is a (tone pourtraiture of a 
knight, with his legs crolTed â€¢, probably one of the old lords Dacre. The arms 
of that noble family are frequent in the windows; both fingle, and quartered 
with the Veteriponts and Cliffords. 

At each corner of the churchyard, there ftands a bear and ragged ftafT, cut in 
ftone â€¢, which bifhop Nicolfon fays looks like fome of the atchievements of the 
honourable family that fo long refided at the neighbouring caftle : which has 
fmce been illuftrated by a very worthy defcendent of the family ; who fup- 
pofes they were cognizances taken by the family, on account of their claim to 
the hereditary forefterfhip of Englewood foreft. And the more fo, as one fees 
thofe jagged branches over and over introduced in the chapel atNaward caftle, 
which is fo rich with arms and cognizances, and where this jagged branch is in 
fome places even thrown acrofs the Dacres arms fefs-wiie. Ranulph de 
Mefchines lord of Cumberland granted this office of forefter to Robert D'Eftri- 
vers lord of Burgh upon Sands in fee. His arms were ; Argent, 3 bears Sable. 
The heirefs D'Eftrivers married Engain. The heirefs of Engain married Mor- 
vill. The heirefs of Morvill married Multon. And Dacre married the heirefs 
of Multon, and by her had the fame right as the others to the forefterfhip of 
Englewood : whkh was fo honourable, and gave fo great command, that there 
is no wonder the family fhould wifh by every means to fet forth their claim to 
it, and (amongft others) by cognizances taken in allufion thereunto ; efpecially 
as the crown about this time feems to have interfered with them in regard to 
4 this 



LEETH WARD. (Dacre.) 383 

this right. And furely nothing could be more naturally adapted to this idea, 
than this bear, which was the arms of their anceftor, the firft grantee of the 
office. And the branch of a tree, which feems fo very allufive to forefts and 
woods, agrees with the fame notion. And it is not improbable, but that this 
might originally be a badge ufed by Robert D'Eftrivers himfelf ; and that he 
chofe the bears in his arms, becaufe they were inhabitants of forefts. 

Matthew Brown late of Whitehaven gave to his executor Dr. Jofeph Brown 
of Queen's College in Oxford 55/, to which the faid Dr. Brown added 10/ 
more ; the intereft of 60/ thereof to fupport a petty fchool, and the intereft of 
the remaining 5/ to go to the poor of the townfhip of Dacre. John Dawfon 
left 5/ to the fame uies equally. Mr. Troutbeck late of Corbridge left 50/, 
the intereft thereof to be diftributed yearly at the difcretion of a Troutbeck of 
that family, as long as there are any fuch at Blencow â€¢, and on failure of fuch, by 
the minifter and churchwardens. They had alfo here ancient poor-ftock of 
4/. All which fums together amount in the whole to 124/. And a convenient 
purchafe offering of an eftate at Motherby holden under the dean and chapter 
ofCarlifle, they purchafed the fame for 144/ 10 s. Edward Hafell of Dale- 
main efquire gave the fum of 20/ 4J, to make up the deficiency, and took the 
purchafe in his own name, and is to direct the ufes thereof. 

Dalemain, within this parifh, is holden of the barony of Grayftock by 
cornage and other fervices, as a fee of the fame. Mr. Denton fays, the firft that 
he had read of who polTelTed the fame was John de Morvilln the reign of Hen. 2. 
Nigell his fon in the 10th of king John; and Walter fon of Nigell in the 
38 Hen. 3. 

In the reign of the fame king Henry the third, Sir Richard de Lay ton knight 
was lord thereof, in whofe name and family it continued for many generations. 
One of whom, William Layton, in the time of king Henry the fixth, by his firft 
wife (who was of the name of Tunftal) had 28 children ; and by his fecond 
wife (who was fifterof Sir Lancelot Threlkeld) had two more. Of this family, 
William Lay ton was meriff of Cumberland in the 5 Cha. 1. and .again in the 
20 Cha. 2. At length the iffue male failing, the eftate came to fix daughters 
coheirs, and was fold to Sir Edward Hafell knight. â€” The arms of Layton 
were-, Argent, a fefs between fix crofs crofslets Sable. 

The faid Sir Edward Hafell married to his firft wife Jane eldeft daughter of 
Sir Timothy Fethcrftonhaugh of Kirk Ofwald knighr, by whom he had no 
jfTue. His fecond wife was Dorothy eldeft daughter of William Williams of 
Johnby hall, by whom he had iflue William, Edward, and John. 

Of his firft wife, there is the following monumental infcription on a brafs 
plate within the rails of the communion table in the church of Dacre: 

Here lies the body of Mrs. Jane Hafell, eldeft daughter of Sir Timothy Fether- 
ftonhaugh of Kirk-Ofwald knight, who was beheaded for his loyalty to king Charles. 
She was firft married to Bernard Kirkbride efquire, and after married to Edward

Near this place lies the body of Sir Edward Hafell knight, jujlice of the peace, 
and deputy lieutenant of the county of Cumberland ; high fJjeriff in 1682 ; elecled 
knight of the fhirefor the fame Anno 1 701. He was twice married; firft, to Jane 
eldeft daughter of Sir Timothy Fetherftonhaugh of Kirk-Ofwald in the f aid county 
knightybut had no iffue by her. His fecond wife was Dorothy eldeft daughter of 
"William Williams <j/"Johnby hall in the faid county gentleman, by whom he had 
three fons William?, Edward, and John. Having always been inclined to dojufiice t 
. to love mercy, and promote peace, and lived a virtuous and fober life, he died the 
. twelfth day of September 1707, in the fix ty-firjl year of his age. â€” To whofe memory 
the faid Dorothy his widow hath caujed this monument to be erecled. 

Of the faid three fons, Williams and John died unmarried. Edward, the 
prefent proprietor of Dalemain, married Julia daughter of Sir Chriftopher 
Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet ; by whom he has ifiue Williams, Edward, 
Chrijio t her, and John-, and three daughters, Julia, Jane, and Mary. 

Their Arms are ; Or, on a fefs Azure, three crefcents Argent, between three

At Great Blencow in this parim a free grammar fchool was founded and 
endowed by Mr. Thomas Burbank in the 19 Eliz. unto which he gave a mef- 
luage or burgage in Grayftock in the county of Cumberland â€¢, one meffbage 
and tenement, 3 roods of land, and one rood of meadow at Weftpurye alias 
Paulefpurye, one other mefluage and tenement in Brixworth, and 3 clofes of 
pafture ground in Geddington, all in the county of Northampton : to be 8 
feoffees, who by writing indented under their hands and feals mall nominate a

the furvivor, fhall make new feoffments to others being inhabitants within 
Great Blencow or Little Blencow. The feoffees may fell the Northamptonfhire 
lands, and buy others in Cumberland or any adjoining county. The lands 
were then worth 10/ a year, and are now let at 50/ or upwards. â€” Befides the 
lands aforefaid, the founder gave 300 /; 50/ whereof was laid out in building 
thelchool, 50/ more put into one Tolfon's hand and loft, 100/ more laid out 
in a rent charge out of Yanwath hall of 61 per annum, 20/ loft upon a mortgage 
of one William Lazonby's lands in Skelton, 45 1 more lent to Mr. Blencow,

In this parifh in 1747 it was certified that there were 151 families-, of which, 
quakers 4, prefbyterians 3, and papiftsone. 

PARISH OF SKELTON. 

Skelton, Scale-town, is a village in the foreft of Englewood, in that place 
jvhere of ancient time the country people that had their fheep, fwine, and milk 

beafts 

e 



LEETH WARD. (Skelton.) 385 

beafls agifted in the forefl, had certain fcaks, fhields, or little cottages to reft in, 
whilft they gathered the fummer profits of fuch goods. And about the time of 
Hen. 1. the Boyvills then lords of Levington firfl planted an habitation there 
for themfelves, and afterwards fetfome tenants there. It continued in the heir 
male of that family until the death of Randolph de Levington. And his 
daughter and heir Hawife, wife of Sir Euflace Baliol knight, dying without 
iffue, the Boyvills lands in Levington, Kirk-Andrews, and Skekon were divided 
among the fix fillers of Ranulph, aunts and next heirs to the faid Hawife, for the 
feigniory thereof. Howbeit, their father Richard and his anceftors had given 
forth before that defcent divers parts of the fame in frank marriage to them and 
others to whom it defcended. 

The purpart of Euphemia, the eldefl, wife of Richard Kirkbride, continued 
in her blood fix defcents ; then Walter Kirkbride fold it to Robert Parving : 
Sir Adam Parving, filler's fon to the faid Robert, fold it to John Denton of 
Cardew ; and his pofterity enjoyed it four defcents, until they fold it to the 
Southaics â€¢, who held it three or four defcents, and then John Southaics fold it 
to the cuftomary tenants. 

The fecond part fell to Margery wife of Robert de Hampton ; whofe grand- 
child William Lockard fon of Symon Lockard fold the fame to John Seaton ; 
whofe fon Chriftopher Seaton forfeited his right to king Edward the firfl ; and 
the faid king gave it to Robert de Clifford lord of Weftmorland, in whofe 
blood it remained till George earl of Cumberland fold it to the inhabitants. 

The third portion was allotted to Iiabel wife of Patrick Southaic, fon of 
Gilbert, fon of Gofpatric de Workington ; from which Patrick it defcended to 
John Southaic, who fold it to the cullomary tenants there. 

The fourth part one Walter Corry held in the right of Eva his wife; but 
their fon and heir, taking part with Robert Bruce and the Scots againft the 
king, forfeited his eflate, which the king granted to one William Marmion. 

The fifth coheir Julian, wife of Patric Trump, had iflue another Patric 
Trump, who fold that part to Robert Tillioll knight. 

The fixth portion fell to Agnes wife of Walter Twinham knight, who had 
ifTue Adam, father to Walter the younger-, and he fold it to Walter Kirkbride. 
Amongft the knights fees in Cumberland, in the 35 Hen. 8. it is found, that 
John Southaic held 14 meffuages, 80 acres of arable land, 20 acres of meadow, 
200 acres of paflure, 100 acres of wood, and a miln, with the appurtenances, in 
Skekon, of the king in capite by knight's fervice, with homage and fealty : and 
that the vill of Skekon pays yearly to the king 4* 6d cornage, by the hands of 
the fheriff of Cumberland. 

In the 7 Eliz. Sir Thomas Dacre knight lord Dacre of Gilfland and Eliza- 
beth his wife granted by fine the manor of Skekon (amongft other particulars) 
and the adwowfon of the re&ory of Skekon, to Thomas Daws and others, 
during the life of the faid Elizabeth. 

That part of the feigniory which remained to the Cliffords, after they had 
fold the tenants free, defcended to Elizabeth daughter and foleheir of Henry 
Clifford earl of Cumberland, who was married to Richard firfl lord Clifford of 
Lanefborough, afterwards earl of Burlington ; from whom it defcended to the 

Vol. II. D d d late 



3 S6 L E E T H W A R D. (Skelton-.) 

late earl of Burlington, who dying in 1750 his whole Englifh eftate came to 
his only daughter the marchionefs of Hartington, who thereby brought this 
part into the duke of Devonshire's family, who receive about 3/ 12 s 6d quit 
rents. 

The other part of this lordmip belongs at prefent to Walter Fletcher of 
Hutton hall elquire. 

In 1767, an act of parliament patted for dividing and inclofing the common 
and feveral wafte grounds within this manor and parifh of Skelton. And after 
quarries, watering places, roads, drains, watercourfes, and one thirteenth part to 
the rector in lieu of tithes, are fet out ; one fixteenth part of the refidue is affigned 
to the faid lords equally to be divided between them, in lieu and full difcharge 
of all feignioral right (royalties excepted). 

The church of Skelton, according to bifhop Nicolfon, is dedicated to St. 
Mary ; according to Dr. Todd, to St. Michael. And there feems to be ground 
for the two different opinions. Upon one of the two bells belonging to this- 
church is an inicription, Ave Maria gratia plena j on the other, Sancle Michael 
era pro nobis. And the difference perhaps may be thus accounted for. When 
the feaft of the dedication of the church (which originally was on the day facred 
to the Saint to whom the church was dedicated) happened to be at an inconve- 
nient feafon, as in feed-time or harveft, it became ufual to transfer it to the 
moft vacant time of the year, about Michaelmas, when the harveft was got in. 
And king Hen. 8th's injunctions required all the feafts of dedication to be kept

obtained the reputation of the tutelar faint; more churches being fuppofed to 
be dedicated to him, than to any other faint in the calendar.

llyle of Forcjlarius regis de landa et cuftos Hai<e de Plumpton, which that king and 
his fucceffor Hen. 4. confirmed to him and his heirs. And from thence it was

He married Catherine daughter of Sir George Dalfton of Dalfton baronet, who 
furvived him, and afterwards married to Dr. Thomas Smith dean and afterwards 
bifhop of Carlifle. He raifed a regiment, chiefly at his own expence, for kino-

Carlifle. But afterwards, compofition being made for the eftate, he was fent to

London. (3) Sufanna. (4) Mary. All of which four died without ifiue.

dulgent father, careful of his childrens education, regular in his own life and conver- 
fation. Picus without affeclation, and free without vanity ; charitable, kofpitable, 
and eminently juft. So great a "patriot to his country, that he was chofen knight of 
the foire for Cumberland near 40 years. Much beloved in his life time, and much 
lamented at his death ; but by none more than by his daughter /ilice, who ereiled this 
monument. 

7. Sir Henry Fletcher of Hutton baronet, fon and heir of Sir George, was a 
perfon of great hopes and expectation. For leveral year-, he came from Lon- 
don, and vifited his eftate in the country ; but growing weary of rural diverfions 
and thofe many troubles and difllpatbns of thought that neceflarily attend a larÂ»e 
revenue, he fettled all he had (being about 1500/ per annum) upon a remote 
relation, Thomas F'etchcr of Morefby efquire, referving only for himfelf a fmall 
competency for life, and retired to Downy in Flanders, where he fhortly after 
died in a convent of Englifh monks, and lies buried in a magnificent chapel 
which he built for them at his own expence. He reconciled himfelf to the 

church 



LEET-H W A R b. (Hutton.) 

church of Rome without the knowledge of any of his friends ; and when his 
inclinations were fufpecred, he refufed to admit any arguments to the con- 
trary. Dr. Todd fays of him, that he was of a temper pofitive and refolute,, 
and not very capable of reafoning in points of controverfy. 

After his death, his filters, as heirs at law, prolecuted their title to the 
whole eftate for feveral years in the court of chancery. After great expence 
on both fides, they came to terms of accommodation, that Thomas Fletcher 
efquire fhould enjoy the demefne and lordfhip of Hutton, with fome other 
parts of the eftate, to the value of 500 1 per annum y for his life; and if he 
died without ilTue, then Henry Fletcher Vane efquire, fecond fon to Catharine 
Vane eld eft filler of Sir Henry Fletcher, and relict of Lionel Vane of Long 
Newton in the palatinate of Durham, fhould have and enjoy the whole. 

The faid Thomas Fletcher died without iffue, and Henry Fletcher Vane afore- 
faid fucceeded accordingly : who alio dying without ilfue, his brother 
Walter Vane (now Fletcher) became poflefTed, and now (1772) enjoys the 
whole eftate. 

The church of Hutton is dedicated to St. James. It was anciently called 
the chapel of Hutton in the Foreft, but for feveral ages it has been reputed a 
rectory. The prefent church was built about the year 17 14. 

Robert de Vaux gave this church, and one carucate of land at Hutton, to 
the priory of CarliQe â€¢, whofe grant was confirmed by king Hen. 2. and 
afterwards by king Fd. 2 f. And the dean and chapter, as fucceflbrs of the

Incumbents, that have occurred, were as follows : 

In 1263, Mr. John de Boulton was rector, being in that year witnefs to an 
accord between the abbot of Holm and Sir Richard de Newton knight. 

In 1309, on the death of Sir Richard the late rector, the prior and convent

inftituted on a prefentation by the dean and chapter. 

In the time of the ufurpation, ThomasTodd the rector was ejected by Cromwell's 
fequeftrators, and imprifoned at Carlifle. The crimes laid againft him were, 
that he ufed the Lord's prayer, baptized children, vifited the fick, and fome- 
times preached privately to his parifhioners and others. And one Jack/on was 
appointed to fucceed him -f-. 

In 1689, Nicholas Thomlinfon was inftituted on a prefentation by the dean

After the difTolution of chantries, king Edward the fixth by letters patent 
bearing date Dec. 13, in the 2d year of his reign, grants to Thomas Brende 
of London fcrivener (amongft other particulars) all that the late chantry of the 
blefled virgin Mary founded in the parilh church of Hoton in the county of

faid Thomas Brende and his heirs of the king as of his caftle of Windfor, 
by fealty only, in free focage, and not in capite, for all rents, fervices, 
and demands. 

In 1730, it was certified, that there were in this parifh 62 families j only 
one fingle perfon a prefbyterian, and two old maiden filters papifts. 

PARISH OF NEWTON. 

The parifh of Newton lies within the foreft of Englewood, and confifts 
of two townfhips or conftablewicks, called Newton and Catterlen. 

Newton, by way of diftinclion, is called Newton Regny, of one William de 
Regny fometime owner thereof. In the 33 Hen. 2. William de Regny was im- 
pleaded in a writ of right, by one William de Lafcells for a knight's fee of 
land in Newton Regny, but he did not prevail ; for John Regny fucceeded his 
father William in the 4th of king John. And in the 4 Ed. 1. William his fon 
was owner, and died in that year ; when it defcended to his four daughters 
coheirs. But very foon after, it was the pofTeffion of Robert Burnel bifhop of 
Bath, who in the 18 Ed. 1. granted this manor by fine unto Hugh de Lowther, 
who died in the io Ed. 2. and his fon Hugh fucceeded, and held the village 
of Newton Regny (as the inquifition finds) of the king in capite, by the 
fervice of finding to the faid lord the king in his war againfl Scotland one 
horfeman with a horfe of 4OJ price, armed with a coat of mail, an iron 
helmet, a lance, and a fword, abiding in the war aforefaid for 40 days with 
the king's perfon. 

In an account of knights fees in Cumberland in the 35 Hen. 8. this tenure 
is exprefied with fome little variation : viz. John Lowther knight holds the 
village of Newton Reny of our lord the king in capite by knights fervice, and 
pays to our faid lord the king for cornage by the hands of the fheriffof Cum- 
berland is per annum; and it is holden by the ferjeanty of finding to our faid 

Vol. II. Eee lord 



394 L E E T H W A R D. (Newton.) 

lord the king with his army one horfeman, with habiliments, one lance, and 
one long fword ; as appears of record in the 9 Ed. 3. 

And this manor ftill continues in the houle of Lowther, in the perfon of 
the prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet. 

Catterlen, in the reign of William the conqueror was the pofTeflion of Hat- 
dan father of Willifrid, father of Cartimer, Walter, and Alexander, lords of 
Farlam-f. Hubert de Vallibus, lord of Gifland, accufed Willifrid of high 
treafon, as taking part with king Stephen againft Henry the fecond ; and 
thereupon wrefted the manor from him and got it into his pofTeflion, which 
the faid king Hen. 2. confirmed to him \. 

The defcendents of Hubert, by the name of Vaux of Caterlen enjoyed it 
for many generations. In the 35 Hen. 8. John Vaux held the capital mef- 
fuage and vill of Caterleyn by the fervice of paying to the king 22*/ yearly. 
In the reign of queen Elizabeth Rowland Vaux held the fame. In Mr. Ma- 
chel's time, over the old kitchen door at Caterlen hall were the arms of Vaux 
in a roundel, viz. Or, a fefs cheeky Or and Gules, between 3 garbs Gules 
banded Or. With this legend round in Old Characters, " Let mercy and 
faithfulnes never goy frome the." And underneath, ** At this time 
is Rowland Vaux lord of this place, and builded this house in the 
year of God 1577." With the letters RV. AV. viz. Rowland Vaux, Anne 
Vaux (the name of his wife, who was daughter of Salkeld). 

The laft of the name at Caterlen, viz. John Vaux, dying without iflue 
male, it defcended to two daughters coheirs, who were married to Chrijlopher 
Richmond efquire and Richard Graham of Nunnery gentleman. Mrs. Sufanna 
Richmond, by virtue of her mother's will, who held the fame in purfuance of 
the laft will and teftament of her fon Henry Richmond efquire the laft male heir 
of that family, now (1773) enjoys both the demefne and manor. 

The church of Newton feems to have been very early appropriated to the 
fee of Carlifle. It is of ancient time moft commonly ftyled a chapel, but 
no other parifti is mentioned of which it may be fuppofed to have been 
part.

PARISH OF PENRITH. 

Penrith, as our belt antiquaries affirm, fignifies in the Britifh red Hilly 
and harh its name from the hill of red ftone adjoining : Although Dr. Todd 
fays it hath its denomination from a Roman colony Petriana, where the Ala 
Petriana kept garrifon about three miles north of it, out of whofe ruins (he 
fays) the town had its original. 

This parifh lies in the fouthern extremity of the foreft of Englewood, and 
is bounded by the parifhes of Barton, Dacre, Newton, Hefket, Lazonby, 
Edenhall, and Brougham : And in Dr. Todd's time contained 424 families. 

In the reign of queen Elizabeth, a commiffion was iflued to Henry lord 
Scroop, John bifhop of Carlifle, John Vaughan efquire, John Swift auditor, 
Edward Dacre efquire, Richard Dudley efquire, Simon Slingfby efquir.-, and

Ambrofe Lancafter gentleman, to inquire of all trefpaffes on the waftes within 
the villages and precincls of Penrith, with an injunction to the fheriff to im- 
panel a jury. The complaint was againft Rowland Vaux and his tenants of 
Catterlin for incroachments on that fide ; but on the inquiry, the ancient 
boundary of the cow pafture of Penrith, belonging to the queen's majefty's 
manor of Penrith, was found neceffary to be inquired into and afcertained -f-. 

And on the fide of Edenhall, the boundaries of the faid manor of Penrith 
were afcertained and finally fettled, on a reference to William Milbourne and 
Jofeph Nicollbn efquires, in the year 1765*. 

At the time of the Norman conqueft, this manor of Penrith and the foreft 
of Englewood (within which foreft Penrith is fituate) were in the pofieffion of 
the Scots ; of which they were foon after difpofielTed. Neverthelefs the Scots 
did not thereupon relinquifh their claim. For in the reign of king John, 
William king of Scots claimed the whole three counties of Northumberland, 
Cumberland, and Weftmorland ; which three counties John feems to have 
confented to cede unto him, on William's having paid to John 15000 marks 
of filver (a commodity John had great need of), and John's covenanting that 
Henry or Richard fons of John fhould marry Margaret or Ifabella daughters 
of William (neither of which marriages took effect). 

Afterwards, the two next kings of England and Scotland, viz. Henry the 
third king of England fon of John, and Alexander king of Scotland fon of 
Williarrij renewed thefe differences, and had a further difpute in relation to an 
agreement of marriage to be folemnized between the faid Henry and Margery 
filter of the faid Alexander, which agreement the faid Henry on his part had 
failed to carry into execution. 

Thefe differences at length were compromifed by the pope's mediation, 
and an agreement entred into by Henry and Alexander in prefence of the 
pope's legate, by an inftrument purporting to be an Agreement between 
Henry the third king of England and Alexander king of Scotland, concern- 
ing all plaints which Alexander had againft Henry until Friday next before 
the feaft of St. Michael in the year of our Lord 1237, concerning the 
counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Weftmorland, which Alex- 
ander claimed as his inheritance, and 15000 marks of filver which king John 
father of Henry had received of William king of Scotland father of the faid 
Alexander for certain agreements between John and William, which on the 
part of John had not been fulfilled ; and alfo concerning certain agreements 
between the faid Henry and Alexander, in relation to a contract of marriage 
between the faid Henry and Margery filler of the faid Alexander, which on 
the part of the faid Henry had not been performed : By which prefent agree- 
ment, Alexander releafes and quits claim to Henry king of England and his 
heirs the faid three counties, and alfo the faid fum of money, and all agree- 
ments made between the faid John and William concerning marriage to be 
had between the faid Henry or Richard his brother and Margaret or Ifabella 
filters of Alexander, and alfo all agreements between Henry and Alexander

concerning a marriage between the faid Henry and Margery fifter of the faid 
Alexander. In confederation whereof, the faid Henry gives and grants to the 
faid Alexander 200 librates of land in the faid counties of Northumberland 
and Cumberland, if the faid 200 librates can be found in any of the towns 
where no caflle is fituate-, if not, the deficiency to be made up in places near 
to the faid two counties : To hold to the faid Alexander and his heirs kings of 
Scotland, of the faid Henry king of England and his heirs, paying for the 
fame yearly one foar-hawk at CarliQe by the hands of the conftable of the 
caftle of CarliQe for all fervices. And if any of the faid lands fliall be within 
the bounds of the foreft, the king of England's forefters (hall make no claim 
of puture there or other demand, except only for attachment of pleas of the 
foreft, and this by view of the bailiff of the king of Scotland, if on notice 
he (hall chufe to be prefent-f. 

In 125 1 the faid Alexander died, and was fucceeded by his fon Alexander 
who married Margaret daughter of the faid king Henry the third, who con- 
firmed to Alexander the faid two hundred librates of land, and gave to him 
a bond of 5000 marks of filver, for her marriage portion. And from thence 
thofe lands received the name of the Queen's haims (or demefnes). 

What thefe lands were, will appear from an afiize in the 6 Ed. 1. Jura- 
tores fro rege ad ajfizas dicunt, quod rex Scotia tenet villatam de Penrith^ Lang- 
waldeofby, Scotby, Salkeld Magna, et Carleton. And more particularly, from 
the inquifition poji mortem of the faid Alexander the fon taken at Carlifle (for 
the Cumberland eftates) in the 21 Ed. 1. 1292 â€¢, before Thomas de Norman- 
ville the king's efcheator beyond Trent : viz. " An inquifition taken at Car- 
" lifle on Tuefday in Eafter week in the twenty-firft year of the reign of king

*' Robert de Croglyn, Adam de Ulvefby, Adam de Hoton, Adam Turpp, 
*' John de Stafholl, John de Salkeld, Robert de Tympauron, and Thomas 
" de Lowther. Being fworn how much land Alexander king of Scotland 
*' held of our lord the king of England on the day on which he died, they 
*' fay, that the fame Alexander held of our lord the king of England on the 
" day of his death in capite the manors of Penrith, Soureby, Languetheby, 
" Salkild, Carlatton, and Scotteby. How much of others : They fay, that 
" he held nothing. By what fervice : They fay, by rendring one foar-hawk 
" yearly at the feaft of the affumption of the bleffed virgin Mary at the

" two hundred pounds. And who is next heir, and of what age : They fay, 
" that John de Balliol is next heir, and is of the age of 30 years J." 

This John Balliol was he to whom king Edward the lirft, upon a reference 
to him by the feveral competitors, had awarded the crown of Scotland. The 
faid Alexander the fon having died without any defcendent from him (except

one granddaughter who died foon afrer him) the three principal claimants of the 
crown of Scotland, were Baliol, Bruce, and Haftings, defcended from the three 
daughters of David earl of Huntingdon brother of the aforeiaiJ William king 
of Scotland. Their feveral claims were ; Baliol, defcended from the eldeft 
fitter, claimed that the kingdom of Scotland was an indivifihle fief, and there- 
fore that he folely was intitled in right of primogeniture. Bruce claimed, that 
altho' he was defcended from the fecond filter, yet he was in a nearer degree of 
confanguinity, as being grandfon, whereas Baliol was great grandfon of the com- 
mon anceftor. Haftings, defcended from the third filler, claimed a third part, 
which being decided in favour of Baliol, Haftings neverthelefs claimed a third 
part of the Englifh eftates, as being divifible amongft coparceners. And there- 
fore when Baliol, in pursuance of the faid office being found in his favour, fued 
for livery of the lands of Tindal, Penrith, and Scotteby, with the appurtenances, 
as next heir to Alexander ; Haftings put in his claim for a third part. But he 
not appearing further to profecute his claim, and it being found, that Penrith, 
and Soureby with the appurtenances were given to Alexander and his heirs 
kings of Scotland, and not fimply to him or his heirs, Baliol had livery accord- 
ingly, doing his homage for the fame -f. 

Afterwards, king Edward, quarreling with Baliol, feized all thofe lands, and 
in the 26th year of his reign granted them to Anthony Beck the military bifhop 
of Durham, who had affifted the king at the battle of Falkirk with a confidera- 
ble number of foldiers, and was greatly inftrumental in obtaining the victory. 
But the parliament held at Carliile in the 33d year of that king's reign, not ap- 
proving of the grant, fummoned the bifhop to {hew by what title he had them j 
and he not appearing, they were adjudged to the crown. 

In the 19 Ed. 3. the Scots to the number of 30,000, enter Cumberland/burn 
Penrith, and carry away great numbers of the inhabitants captives into Scotland, 
where they were fold as fo many cattle to the beft bidder. And in the 37th of 
the fame king, the tenants of the manors of Penrith, Salkeld, and Soureby, of 
the ancient demefne of the crown within the foreft of Englewood, by their pe- 
tition fetting forth that their lands and tenements for which they paid a large 
rent to the crown were wafted by the Scots, and their corn there growing often 
deftroyed by the beafts of the foreft ; the king thereupon grants them and their 
heirs common of pafture for all their goods in the faid foreft, in as ample man- 
ner as the prior of Carlifie and William Englifh and other tenants within the 
foreft have by grant of the faid king or any of his progenitors J. 

In the 8 Ric. 2. the Scots made another inroad into the county, and deftroyed 
Penrith, and carried off the goods of the inhabitants. In confideration of

manner to Ralph de Nevil earl of Weftmorland and Johanna his wife. Richard 
de Nevil earl of Warwick and heir of the faid Ralph, being (lain in the battle 
of Barnet in the 1 1 Ed. 4. the whole eftate for defect of heirs male reverted to 
the crown, and continued as part of the royal demefne, till king William the 
third gave the honour of Penrith and all its dependences with the appurte- 
nances, within the foreft of Englewood, to William Bentinck whom the king 
afterwards created earl of Portland, for his fervices to the faid king in bringing 
about the revolution in this kingdom, and thereby fecuring our religion and 
liberties. Of which family our account is as follows : 

I. William Bentinck efquire was page of honour to William prince of 
Orange, and afterwards gentleman of the bedchamber. In the year 1677 he 
was fent by the prince to folicit a match with the lady Mary, eldeft daughter to 
James then duke of York, which was foon after concluded. On the duke of 
Monmouth's invafion of this kingdom, he was fent over to offer his matter's 
affiftance to king James, both of his troops and perfon. In 1688, when the 
prince of Orange had thoughts of an expedition into England, he fent Mr. 
Bentinck, on the elector of Brandenburgh's death, with his compliments to 
the new elector, and to lay before him the ftate of affairs, and to know how 
much he might depend upon his affiftance ; and was fo fuccefsful in his nego- 
tiations, that he carried to his mafter a full promife of all that was defired. He 
attended the prince in the faid expedition, and it is faid was principally relied 
on in that enterprize. After his mafter's acceffion to the throne of thefe realms, 
he was made privy purfe, and groom of the ftole, a lieutenant-general of his 
majefty's forces, colonel and captain of a regiment of Dutch horfe, knight of 
the garter, baron of Cirencefter, vifcount Woodftock, and earl of Portland. He

which was firft agreed between him and marefchal Boufflers in the field between

Befides chis grant of Penrith and its dependencies, he had a grant of the lord- 
fhipsof Denbigh, Bromfield, and Yale, with other lands, comprehending the 
belt part of one of the counties of Wales -, but that grant was refumed, on an 
addrefs of the houfe of commons for that purpofe. Alfo he had a grant of one 
hundred and thirty-five thoufand acres of the forfeited eftates in Ireland; but

Mrs. Gafgarth now enjoys Hutton hall in Penrith ; and (which is fomewhat 
extraordinary) holds divers lands there of the bifhop of Carlifle, called Bifhop's 
Flat, by leafe for 2 1 years, which faid lands have been long held by cuftomary 
tenure of the bifhop's lefiee. 

Another mefne manor was held by the Carletons of Carleton hall : of

Dugdale's vifitation of Cumberland in 1665. 

The firft five in the pedigree are barely named, Baldwyn, Jeffrey de Carleton., 
Odard de Carleton, Henry de Carleton, and Gilbert de Carleton ; the firft of whom, 
by the courfe of chronology, afcending from thofe that are dated afterwards, 
muft go nearly to the time of the conqueft.

Carlifle, and died in the 29 Eliz. 

'Thomas Carleton married Barbara daughter of Hugh Lowther of Lowther,

Sir Thomas Carleton of Carleton knight, the feventh in fuccefiion of the name 
of Thomas, married Elizabeth daughter of John Shelly of Woodborough in 
the county of Nottingham, and widow of Marmaduke Conftable. He died in 
the i4Cha. 1. without iflue. His brother Gerard Carleton died before him;, 
which Gerard married Nichola daughter of Elliot of Redhugh in Scotland, and 
by her had a fon William who fucceeded to the inheritance. 

Sir William Carleton of Carleton knighr, fon of Gerard, married to his firfl

had iflue Mary of the age of 18 years at the faid vifitation of Sir William Dug- 
dale. To his fecond wife he married Barbara daughter of Robert de la Vale of 
Cowpan in the county of Northumberland efquire, and had ifTue by her at the

This Robert died without iflue male in the year 1707 ; and John Pattinfonof 
Penrith attorney at law purchafed Carleton hall. He was fucceeded by his

to his three fillers coheirs,, and Carleton hall was afligned to theeldeft fifter Eliza- 
beth then wife and now widow of Thomas Simpfon efquire, an eminent attor- 
ney at law, and juftly celebrated for his learning, integrity, and extraordinary 
natural endowments. 

The Arms of Carleton are â€¢, Ermin, a bend Sable, charged with 3 pheons 
Argent. The Creft : On a wreath an Arm dexter Proper, ready to discharge 
a dart or arrow. 

The town of Penrith hath a very large market on Tuefday weekly, and a 
fair on Tuefday in Whiriinvweek, and on every Tuefday fortnight after until 
Lammafs. 

Biftiop Strickland was at the expence of drawing a watercourse from the river 
Petterel thro' this town â€¢> which is of exceeding great benefit to the inhabi- 
tants. 

On the weft fide of the town ftands the castle, of fquare ftone, inclofed- 
with a ditch â€¢, which by its largenefs and ruins feems to have been a place of 
fome ftrength and consideration. But it feems not to have been very ancient. 
For when the 200 librates of land (as is aforefaid), of which Penrith was par?, 
were given to the king of Scots â€¢, there was a fpecial reservation* that thofe 
lands fhould not be where there were any caftles. King Richard the third, 
when he was duke of Gloucefter, that he might be more at hand to oppofe the 
Scots, and keep the country in obedience, which was generally of the Lan- 
caftrian intereft, refided in this caftle for fome time, and inlargedand ftrengthen- 
ed it with towers and other works. The ftones for that purpofe, it is fatd, he 
had from an old ruin, fuppofed to have been a place of Druid worfhip, at 
Mayburgh, about a mile diftanr, on the fouth fide of the river Eamont. In the 

civil 



LEETH WARD. (Penrith.) 405 

civil wars in the time of king Charles the firft, this fabrick was totally ruined, 
and all the lead and timber fold for theufe of the commonwealth. 

On the eaft part of the parifli, upon the north bank of the river Eamont, are 
two caves or grottoes^ dug out of the folid rock, and fufficient to contain 100 
men. The paffage to them is very narrow and dangerous, and perhaps its 
perilous accefs may have given it the name of Jfts Parlis, tho' the vulgar tell 
ftrange ftories of one Ifis a giant who lived here in former times, and like Cacus of 
old ufed to feize men and cattle, and draw them into his den to devour them. 
But it is highly probable, that thefe fubterraneous chambers were made for a 
fecure retreat in time of fudden danger ; and the iron gates, which were taken 
away not long ago, do not a little confirm that fuppofnion. 

The church of Penrith is dedicated to St. Andrew, and is vicarial, having 
been given by king Hen. 1. to the bifhop of Carlifle at the firft erection of the 
lee. It is valued in the king's books at i 2/ 6s %d. And is now worth about 
100 1 per annum (including an augmentation of 32/ out of the great tithes, and 
other benefactions). 

About the year 1326, king Ed. 2. iflued a writ of Certiorari to the then 
guardian of the temporalties, concerning his receipts from this and Dalfton vi- 
carages, and the return as to Penrith was, that it having been appropriated ad 
men/am epifcopi, tithe wool and lamb had been ufed to be paid to the bifhop, and 
therefore was now received by him, but all oblations and obventions belonged 
to the vicar. And by the leafe of the rectory now granted to John Richardfon 
efquire, all the tithes of corn, grain, hay, lamb, wool, and milns are demifed. 

For the augmentation of this fmall vicarage and of the vicarage of Dacre, 
about the year 1669, Mr. William Mawfon of Timpaurin, having then a leafe 
from the dean and chapter of Carlifle of the corn tithes of Sleagill and Thrimby 
in the parifh of Morland for 21 years (fevcral years being run) gave the fame- 
by will to the vicars of Penrith and Dacre in truftees who were to renew the 
leafe from time to time, each of the legatees to have an undivided clear moiety. 
This being found inconvenient by the truftees, a divifion was made by mutuaL 
confent of the parties concerned, and the vicars of Penrith had the whole tithe 
ofSlegill affigned to them in a diftinct leafe, and the vicars of Dacre that of 
Thrimby. In procefs of time, the truftees for Penrith neglected to renew the 
leafe, and left the fole care of that to the vicar, to whofe cuftody the leafe was 
committed. Mr. Child the then vicar renewed the leafe ; but thinking that the 
term might laft his time, neglected to renew it again, tho' it was more than fe- 
ven years run. Mr. Farrington the next vicar, upon his being inducted, thought 
it hard for him to renew for years of which he had received no profit ; and, liv- 
ing only four years after, left the leafe unrenewed. Dr. Todd, the next fuc- 
cefibr, being a member of the chapter, after fome years were run out in his time, 
did prevail with the dean and chapter (with confent and at the requeft of the 
furviving truftees) to put upon the leafe an additional yearly rent, which by a 
moderate eftimate might amount tothefum of a fine every feven years, and fo to 
have the leafe granted to him and his fucceflors vicars of Penrith for ever.

Dr. Smith bifhop of Carlifle, who died in 1 702, by a claufe in his will fays, 
" Item, I give and bequeath for and towards the augmentation of the vicarage 
of Penrith and the better maintenance and encouragement of the vicars incum- 
bent there for ever the fum of 500/-, and my will is, that the faid fum be paid 
within fix months next after my deceafe unto the dean and chapter of the 
cathedral church of Carlifle, whom 1 do hereby conftitute and appoint fupervifors 
of this my laft will and teftament and truftees for the laid charity, requelting 
them to fee the fame duly fettled and fecured according to my intention and will 
herein, unlefs I (hall difpofe, fettle, and pay the fame in my life-time." Which 
fum was afterwards laid out in a purchafe of lands at Clifton. 

By indenture bearing date Dec. 19, 1740; Mary Bell of Penrith, fpinfter, 
grants to the churchwardens of the parifh of Penrith and their fuccefibrs 240/, 
in truft to lend out the fame upon fuch fecurity as the vicar fhall under his hand 
approve of, and pay the intereft thereof to the vicar for reading morning prayers 
in the parilh church of Penrith in every week day in the year, and alfo evening 
prayers on every week day during the time of Lent â€¢, firft deducting thereout 
their own reafonable expences in carrying the faid truft into execution.

In the year 1355, bifhop Welton conftitutes Sir John vicar of Penrith to be

mandate to Sir I homas rector of Burgham and John de Docwra chaplain, to 
denounce the fentenceof the greater excommunication againft certain unknown 
perfons, who had broken up a paved way, and done fome other outrages in the 
churchyard at Penrith, referving to himfelf the fole power of abfolution. Here- 
upon feveral of the parifhioners came to the bifhop at Rofe, confefied themfelves 
Â»uilty, and prayed for a remiflion of the heavy ientence ; which was granted, 
on condition of each man's offering (by way of penance) a wax candle of three 
pounds weight, before the image of St. Mary in the parifh church of Penrith on 
the Sunday following. â€” In the fame year, Sir John vicar of Penrith hath a 
licence granted to him, to continue from the 8th of March till Eafter following, 
to hear the confefiions of all his parifhioners, and to give abfolutions upon the 
performance of penance injoined, except in cafes fpecially referved to the bifhop; 
which referved cafes were thofe of the viobters of the rights and liberties of the 
bifhop and his church of Carlifle, ravifhers of nuns or having carnal knowledge 
of them, and perjured perfons in aflizes, or caufes of matrimony or divorce, or 
difherifon, or lois of life or limb. 

In 1428, John Hawekin was vicar of Penrith, being in that year made a 
truftee in the fettlement of fome lands at Yanewith.

ejected, one Baldwin had his place, who repaired the vicarage houfe with part 
of 100/ given to him for that purpofe out of the fequeftred livings. On the

far the molt compleat and elegant parifh church in the diocefe. The galleries 
are fupported by twenty (tones, brought from the quarry of Crowdundale, each 
ten feet four inches high, and four feet two inches in circumference. It was- 
confecrated by bifhop Nicolfon then bifhop of Londonderry, at the requefi 
of bifhop Bradford the diocefan. The whole expence of it was 2253/ 165

From the many trifling monumental infcriptions that one meets with every

This plague is mentioned in the regifter book of Penrith, and alfo in that 
of Edenhall. 

William de Strickland (the fame who was afterwards bifhop) founded a 
chantry in the church of Penrith, and fettled a yearly falary of 61 to be paid 
out of his lands in Penrith to a chantry prieft who mould teach children in 
church mufick and grammar. 

There was alfo a houfe of grey friers of St. Auguftine in Penrith, founded 
in the reign of Ed. 2. or before ; which after the diffolution was granted, in 
the 34 Hen. 8th, to Robert Tyrwhit efquire. â€” In the 30 Ed. 3. Agnes Denton 
widow gave to them by her will 10s. And it was the cuftom to maintain 
this poor fort of monks by fuch bequefts and voluntary charities. In the 33 
Ed. 3. the bifhop grants an indulgence of 40 days, to all fuch as mould be 
prefent when the Auguftine monks lighted their candles on Chriftmas day 
and gave them fome charity becaufe they were very poor. 

In the church-yard of Penrith, on the north fide thereof, ftand two pyra- 
midal ftones, near four yards in height, at five yards diftance from each other; 
and having feveral fegments of circular ftones erected between them. Thefe 
laft the fancy of the people will have to reprefent wild boars ; and they have 
a tradition, that a famous knight-errant, one Sir Ewan Cadarius, was buried 
here, who in his time made mighty havock amongft thofe beads in Ingle- 
wood foreft. Mr. Sandford, in his manufcripx account of Cumberland, lays, 
he was told by Mr. Page (who was fchoolmafter at Per.rith from 1581 to 
1 591) that a ftranger gentleman coming to an inn there, defired to have fome 
of the considerable inhabitants to fup with him, whereupon this Mr. Page and 
fome others attended him. The ftranger told them he came to fee the anti- 
quities of the place ; and drawing out a paper faid, that Sir Hugh Ctefario 
had an hermitage fome-where thereabouts called Sir Hugh's parlour : And Mr. 
Sandford adds, that when he was at fchool at Penrith this place was opened 
by William Turner, who there found the great long (hank bones of a man 
and a broad fword. 

Within the town of Penrith there was a free grammar school of ancient 
time. In the year 1340, the bifhop granted a licence to John de Efkeheved 
clerk to teach here the art of Grammar - t the fchool (as is there faid) being 

the 



LEETH WARD. (Fekrith.) 411 

the bifhop's and under his patronage and of that of his predeceffors in former 
times. In 136 1, another licence was granted to Robert de Burgham chaplain 
to teach boys and youth the pfaiter, Prifcian's grammar, and finging : With 
an inhibitory clauie againft all others. Bifhop Strickland (as aforefaid) re- 
qtaired his chantry prielt to teach mufic and grammar for the (alary of 6/ a 
year. Upon the diflfolution of the chantries this revenue continued in the 
crown until the 6th year of queen Elizabeth ; at which time fhe, moved 
thereto by the humble petition of the inhabitants of Penrith, and at the in- 
ftance of Sir Thomas Smith knight then dean of Carlisle and fecretary of 
ftate, did by her letters patent bearing date the 18th day of July in the fame 
year found and erecl: a free grammar fchool, in this her feigniory and chief 
town within the foreft of Inglewood, under the ftyle and title of The Free 
Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth in Penrith ; and did endow it at the 
fame time with 61 ancient falary of the chantry prieft ; to have one mailer 
and ufher ; and to be governed by five of the moft difcreet perfons of the 
town and parifh, with power to chufe both mafter and ufher, and to elecl: new 
governors upon the death of any of their number. 

In 1633, Sir John Lowther conveyed to Mr. William Whelpdale fome feats 
under Archer's hall (the Crofs) at it 6s Sd rent, which was given by the 
town to the fchool. In like manner, a large piece of ground called Ling 
Stubbs was given to the fchool by the joint confent of the town and the king's 
commiffioners ; but the fame was fold by Mr. Andrew Whelpdale to John 
Benfon, referving only a quit rent of 20 s to the fchool, whereas the land 
was at the lime of its firft fettlement valued at 40s per annum, and is now worth 
ten times that fum. There are alfo feveral leafes of houfes in the fchool re- 
giftcr, which run for 21 years ; but the premiffes have long been wholly un- 
known, and the rents turned into free or quit rents. Dr. Todd fays, Upon a 
law fuk in chancery concerning the revenue of the fchool, Mr. William 
Whelpdale having got the writings and evidences of the fchool into his cuf- 
tody and poffefiion, and refufing to give an account thereof, it was decreed, 
that neither any of the governors, nor any nearly related to them, fhould be 
farmers of the fchool lands, or have any thing to do with the revenue. 

In the year 1661, William Robinfon of London citizen and grocer, gave 
by his will to the grocers company all his lands, rents, and hereditaments in 
Grubftreet to the ufes following ; viz. To pay out of the rents and profits 
thereof 20/ yearly to the churchwardens, veftrymen, and overfeers of the 
parifh of Penrith, for the ufe of 20 poor people, ten men and ten women, of 
the faid p.irifh, on the 25th day of December ; and 20* for a fermon to be

and fexton ; and 15J to the churchwardens, veftrymen, and overfeers for a 
collation : And 10/ yearly to the ufe of the free fchool of Penrith : And alfo 
20/ yearly to the churchwardens, for the educating and bringing up of poor

eftate, after debts and legacies paid, to the faid fchool founded by Mr. Ro- 
binfon ; the intereft thereof to be applied towards the employing of poor 
children in the working of worded and knitting in the faid fchool, at the dis- 
cretion of her executors, with power to them to nominate two able perfons to 
carry the faid will into execution. The effects came to about icol; for which 
the Surviving executor granted an annuity of 5/ out of certain lands, to four 
truftees and their heirs male â€¢, if any of them die without an heir male, the 
furvivors to chufe another in the town of Penrith â€¢, and they to appoint the 
girls fo to be taught, with the affiftance of the owner of the lands out of 
which the rent charge iffues. 

Mr. Roger Sleddale by his will in 1690 gave ic7 to be lent to the mafter 
or miftrefs of the faid fchool without intereft, on their giving fecurity for the 
fame to be repaid when they die or ceafe to teach. 

PARISH OF EDENHALL. 

Edenhall (the next parifh) is bounded by the river Eden on the eafh, 
Eamot on the fouth, the parifh of Penrith on the weft, and Salkeld on the 
north. It was firft given to Henry Fitz-Swene, younger brother of Adam Fitz- 
Swein. In Henry the third's time Robert Turp died feized thereof, his fon 
Adam Turp being then an infant of feven years of age. Which Adam had a 
fon Robert Turp, who had two daughters coheirs, of whom Julian in the 1 Ed. 
3. was married to William Stapilton. 

The Stapiltons held it for five defcents â€¢, then Joan fecond daughter and 
coheir of Sir William Stapilton knight transferred it to Thomas de Mufgrave 
about the 38 Hen. 6. in which name and family it (till continues. 

The anceftor of this family moft probably came in with William the Con- 
queror, for very foon after the conqueft we find them feared at Mufgrave in 
Weftmorland, where they had large poffeffions, and to which place they gave 
name. After their purchafe of Hartley caftle, and the acquisition of Eden- 
hall by this inter- marriage, they transferred their habitation to Hartley and 
Edenhall alternately, and of late years chiefly to Edenhall ; faving that the 
prefent owner having received Kempton Park in Middlelex by his mother, 
daughter of Sir John Chardin, he now frequently refides in Middlefex. This 
family we have deduced at large at Mufgrave aforefaid, which was their firft 
habitation in thefe counties, and of which they ftill continue proprietors. 

The church of Edenhall is dedicated to St. Cuthbert â€¢, and is vicarial, 
having been given by king Edward the firft to the prior and convent of Car- 
lifle, who foon after got it appropriated to their priory. It is valued in the 
king's books jointly with Langwathby at 17/ us id; was certified to the 

governors

governors of queen Anne's bounty at 43/ js Sd; and is now worth about 
70/ yearly. 

In the year 12C9, John de Ludam deacon was prefented to this church by 
the prior and convent of Carlifle â€¢, who affigned to him for his fupport the 
whole altarage of the church, and a moiety of the land and meadow of Eden- 
hall (that is, of the glebe land, as it feemeth) and four pounds of filver out 
of their chamber yearly. 

In 1341, the bifliop- being informed of the infirm ftate of Sir Adam vicar 
of Edenhall, directs his official to give him tender notice to pitch upon fomc 
coadjutor, who may be licenfed to affift him in his cure. 

In 1362, upon the deuh of Sir John de Lendham vicar of Edenhall, Sir 
J-ohn de Marejball was prefented by the prior and convent, and thereupon infti- 
tmed, on his having taken the oath of perfonal refidence according to the 
form of the conflicution of the legate in that cafe provided. 

In 1368, the prior and convent having procured the profits of the church 
of Edenhall and chapel of Langwathby to be appropriated to themfelves, 
refer the allowance for the fupply of both the faid cures to be fettled by the 
bifhop, and impower their iubprior to be their proctor to confent to the fame. 
.And in the fame year John de Kirkby was prefented to the vicarage, on his ex- 
changing Burgh by Sands with Eudo de Ravenjlandale ihen vicar of Edenhall. 

In 1465, Robert Goodylow was vicar; having in that year a legacy given 
him in the vicar of Stanwix's will proved by the bifhop. 

In 1565 Alan Scott, M. A* was prefented : He was provofl of Queen's 
College in Oxford, and refigned his provoftfhip, and refided and died at 
Edenhall. 

In 1578, on the death of Alan Scott, Sir William Smith clerk was prefented 
by virtue of an affigned grant long before made by Sir Thomas Smith knight 
dean and the chapter of Carlifle. 

In 1609, on the death of William Smith, inflitution was given to Thomas 
Maplett, M. A. who was prefented by Sir Chriftopher Parking knight dean 
and the chapter of Carlifle. 

In 1669, Gilbert Burton was prefented upon the death of Simon Green. 

In 1683, John Leigh, M. A. on the death of Gilbert Burton. 

In 1 690, on the deprivation of John Leigh, George Moon fucceeded. 

In 1743, upon Mr. Moon's death, Chrijlopher Mufgrave, M. A. was col- 
lated by bifhop Fleming on a lapfe. 

In 1763, on the ceffion of Chriftopher Mufgrave (then D. D.) Jofeph Row- 
land clerk was inftituted on a prefentation by the dean and chapter. 

In 1774, on the death of Jofeph Rowland, Roger Baldwin, D. D. was in 
like manner prefented and inftituted. 

The abbey of Holme Cultram had 14 acres of land at Edenhall given by 
Robert Turp â€¢, and other lands there given by Alan Turp : With pafture for 
700 fheep, and for other goods as much as belonged to the faid lands f.

And in the 37 Hen. 8. Mar. 20, the faid king grants to Thomas lord Whar 1 - 
ton one menuage and tenement, and all thofe feveral parcels of land lying in 
the fields of Edenhall, and one holme or pafture containing 8 acres, then in 
the tenure of Edward Mufgrave knight, late belonging to the monaftery 
of Holm Cultram. 

The parifh regifter of Edenhall takes notice of 42 perfons (about a fourth 
part of the parifh) dying there of the plague in 1598 ; who were buried near 
their ledges on Penrith fell, Shaddow Burgh or Edenhall fell, Fiatt's clofe, 
and other places. 

There are now in the parifh about 35 families ; all of the eftablifhed 
church. 

They have a fmall charity here of about 7/ a year, given at different times 
by the Mufgrave family; which is chiefly applied for the maintenance of 
a petty fchool. 

PARISH OF SALKELD. 

The parifh of Salkeld, or Great Salkeld (as it is often flyled in the bifhopt 
regifters), adjoins upon Edenhall on the ibuth, Lazonby on the welt and 
north, and the river Eden on the eaft. It is one of thofe places that was 
granted to the king of Scots as we have mentioned above, and afterwards re- 
lumed by the crown of England, upon which account it is fometimes called 
Salkeld Regis, and finally granted by king William the third to the anceftor 
of the duke of Portland the prefent proprietor. 

The church here is dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and is annexed to the arch- 
deaconry of Carlifle. When it was firfl appropriated to or made a corps of 
the archdeaconry doth not appear. There are no inftitutions or collations to 
it feparately in the oldeft regifters at Rofe : therefore it feemeth to have been 
annexed to the archdeaconry at the firft foundation of the fee. 

As to the value thereof, in bifhop Appleby's regifter, in the year 1366, it 
is certified by John de Appleby the archdeacon, that the church of Salkeld 
Regis annexed to his archdeaconry was taxed at 12/ fterling according to the 
old valuation (namely, that of pope Nicholas), and at 40/ according to the 
new valuation (of king Edward the fecond). In Henry the eighth's taxation 
it is rated at 22/ 10/ lod -, and is now worth about golfer annum. 

The church and fteeple feem to have been built at different times. The 
fteeple feems to be of a much later erection â€¢, and intended, upon occafion, 
for a fecure hold or habitation for the rector himfelf : So the iron door below, 
and the good cellar, with feveral chimnies within, perfuade us to believe. 
Bifhop Nicolfon fuppofes it to be the work of archdeacon Clofe, brother to 
the bifhop of that name. The faid archdeacon lies buried in the quire under 
a large blue graveftone, with an infeription ij} brafs, whereof nothing is now 

legible.

legible. There were alfo anciently the like commemorations of him in the 
windows, with an Orate pro Anima. 

The parfonage houfe was left in a ruinous condition by archdeacon Weft -, 
but Mr. Thomas Mufgrave, afterwards doctor in divinity and dean of Carlifle, 
repaired it handfomely and at confiderable expence, and built the ftable and 
granary from the ground. The reft of the outhoufes (the old kitchen only 
excepted and a fmall part of the lictle barn) were all built by arehdeacon 
Nicolfon. 

There are about 60 families in this parifh, of which feven are prefbyterians. 

There is a â– parijh Jlock of 9/ 6s. And a poorjlock of 34/ 4 s \d. 

Alfo here is a free fchoeU which was founded about the year 15 15; endowed 
with feveral fmall rents, charged on fundry parcels of land in the faid parifh, 
together with fines upon defcents and alienation. Some of which rents and 
fines having been wkhholden, the matter is and hath been long contefting in 
the court of chancery. 

In the year 1360, the bridge at Salkeld being fallen, bifhop Welton pub- 
lifhed an indulgence of 40 days to all who mould contribute to the repair of 
it. We have met with accounts of many other indulgences granted on like 
occafions, and are enabled from that bifhop's regifter to exhibit the form of 
fuch indulgence, which therefore as a curiofity we fhall here infert : " Uni-

PARISH OF LAZONBY. 

The parifh of Lazonby adjoins upon Salkeld on the fouth, Penrith and 
Hutton on the fouth weft and weft, Hefket on the north weft, and the river 
Eden on the eaft and north eaft : And contains in the whole about 115 fa- 
milies, four whereof are prefbyterians. 

Lazonby lies within the foreft of Englewood, but has been long a feparate 
manor ; heretofore in the poflefiion of the Stutevils, and by marriage of the 
heirefs of the Stutevils came to the Morvils, then to the Muttons, and from 
them came to the Dacres. It was fettled upon a younger branch of the Dacres 
and their iflue male, and on failure thereof to go to the heirs general of the 
family, who were the lords Dacre of the fouth. Leonard Dacre, fecond 
brother of Thomas lord Dacre of the north, being feized thereof in tail male, 
was attainted in the 12 Eliz. for being concerned in the affair of Mary queen 
of Scots, as were alfo his two younger brothers Edward and Francis. Edward 
died in the 21 Eliz. and Leonard died in the 23 Eliz. afcer whofe death the 
intailed eftate continued in the crown during rhe life of Francis and any who 
mould claim as heir male of his body. And this feems to be the reafon why 
thefe brothers were not executed, but only banifhed, as the crown held the 
eftate by. the tenure of their lives. 

On the death of Leonard, a commifiion iflued to Henry lord Scroop, the 
biftiop of Carlifle, and others, to inquire what goods and chattels, and what 
lands and tenements, the faid Leonard Dacre had or held at the time of his 
death â€¢, who return, that he had no goods and chattels, and that Philip earl of 
Arundel in the right of Anne his wife, and the lord William Howard in the 
right of Elizabeth his wife, had and received to their own ufe ail the rents 
and profits of the Dacre eftate, except what were in the hands of the queen; 
and that Francis Dacre fon of the late William lord Dacre, and brother of the 
faid Leonard Dacre, hath iflue male Francis Dacre of his body lawfully 
begotten ; which faid Francis the father and Francis the fon are in full life, to 
wit, at Carlifle in the county aforefaid. 

The faid Francis the fon had a fon Ranulf, who died in the 10 Charles 1. 
without iflue, whereby the intail ended. Neverthelefs, the king continued in 
pofteflion, and after him the commonwealth of England, until the year 1657, 
when Francis lord Dacre of the fouth, heir general of the family of Dacre, 
fued in the court of exchequer for the recovery of Lazonby (and other pof-

From which time Lazonby continued in the Dacres till about the year 
17 16, when it was fold (amongft other particulars) to Sir Chriftopher Muf- 
grave of Edenhall baronet, by the coheirs of Thomas earl of SufTex, being 
heirs general of the eftate of the Dacres of the fouth. 

The tenants pay yearly to the prefent lord of the manor Sir Philip Muf- 
grave baronet, a free rent of 2/ 7 J iÂ±d ; indenture rent, by agreement Dec. 4, 
1676, 9/ 15 J yid; arbitrary rent 3 s zd- t Potter rent 1/4J; and for im- 
provements 3 j 1 id. â€” The Potter rent is faid to be for liberty to get clay, of 
which there is a very fine white fort, for making of earthen ware. 

Within thefe precincts there is a fmall mefne cuftomary manor belonging 
to Timothy Fetherftonhaugh efquire, whofe anceftors have long refided at the 
neighbouring town of Kirkofwald. 

The church of Lazonby is dedicated to St. Nicholas, and was given by 
Sir Hugh de Morvil to the priory of Lanercoft, and in 1272 was appropriated 
to that houfe : And an endowment was made for the vicar, and the collation to 
the vicarage referved to the bifhop. 

In 1300, Sir William de Haloghton was collated by bifhop Halton. 

In 13 16, upon the death of the faid Sir William de Haloghton, the bifhop 
collates Sir Adam de Ottley chaplain. 

In 1367, the laft will and teftament of William de 'Threlkeld vicar of Ley-

in the next year made an exchange with John de Cafiro Bernardi vicar of New- 
ton in Glendale in the diocefe of Durham, who thereupon is collated to the 
vicarage of Leyfingby. 

In 1477, Edward Rot hion was vicar, being alfo at the fame time vicar of

In 1484, an award was made by bifhop Bell, between the priory and con-

touching the tithes of wool and lamb and other fmall dues ; which award was 
in favour of the vicar, And in 1513, at the inftance of the faid vicar Boon,

Plumpton park, in this parifn, being ademefne of the crown, was leafed 
out for a long term to Jack Mufgrave captain of Bewcaftle, who planted there 
(Mr. Sandford fays) five fons on five feveral tenements, with many other te-

After the expiration of the Mufgrave leafe, king James the firft by letters

Finally, James earl of Annandale, Aug. 19, 1653, for the fum of 3000/, 
grants to dame Ellinor Lowther of Mauls Meaburn widow, and others, (where- 
by the fame came into the Lowther family) all that the manor or lordftrip of

Wallas tenement, and 13 other tenements and parcels of ground by name,

With a covenant of warranty aganft the faid earl James, John late earl of An- 
nandale, James late king of England, and Charles late king of England. 

In the year 1767, a very handfome new chapel was erected at Plumpton 
Wall, at the expence of about 200/, raifed by contributions in the neighbour- 
hood. Mr. John Brown late of Plumpton aforefaid endowed it with zoo/, 
and the feats make 3/ 9 J 6d. It was confecrated by bifhop Lyttelton in 1767, 
and dedicated to St. John the evangelift â€¢, and the nomination of the curate de- 
clared to be in Mr. John Sanderfon heir to Mr. Brown. 

Old Penrith lies within this divifion, of which we fhallgive Mr. Horfley's 
account, as much the moft accurate and fatisfaftory of any thing hitherto 

published : 

" Old Penrith (he fays), which I take to be Bremetenracum, ftands upon the 
grand military way that leads directly to CarliQe or to the wall, and is vifible 
almoft all the way to it. And excepting CarliQe (which I believe to be Lugu- 
vallium ad vallum, but abandoned before the writing of the Notitia) there 
feems never to have been any ftation on this way nearer to the wall than Old 
Penrith. The remains of the outbuildings here continue very confiderable, as 
â€ž well 



LEETH WARD. (Plumpton.) 421 

well as thofe of the Ration itfelf. The fort is about 6 chains (or 132 yards) 
in length, 5 in breadth, containing about 3 acres ; which is a ftation of a 
middle fize. The place near the ftation is called Plumpton Wall, being a long 
and fcattered village. The fort itfelf is called Caftle-Steeds, and the houie 
that ftands neareft it The lough, from a fmall lake, as it feemeth, juft before it. 
The faid Plumpton Wall takes in the whole row of houfes, of which the hough 
is one. The ftation lies about 200 yards from the river Peterel, which runs on 
the weft fide of it. The ramparts are ftill very high, and the ditch round them 
very perfedt. The four gates, or entries, are all very vifible, and juft in the 
middle of the ramparts. The Pr<ctorium alfo appears, though by working 
ftones out of it they have fpoiled its figure. On the weft fide there is a de- 
fcent, as ufual, towards the river, and great ruins of a town. The ruins of 
buildings alfo on the other fides, particularly on the eaft and fouth, are very 
remarkable, and the whole like a Notitia ftation, though the ftones have been 
wrought away, and ufed in building the village. The eaft and weft ramparts 
are about 140 yards long, and the north and fouth about 120. The prato- 
rium is near the north rampart. The fituation of the fort is alfo very remark- 
able, being one of thofe that have the profpect every way terminated by hills 
or rifing ground, overlooking the vale in the middle. The diftance to New 
Penrith is about 5 miles, and to Carlifle 13. This ftation appears to have 
been poffefied by the Romans in the reign of Alexander Severus from the in- 
fcription at Great Salkeld. This ftation feems to be that which is called Vo- 
reda in the Itinerary, and Bereda by the anonymous Ravennas. According to 
the Notitia, the cuneus armaturarum, that is, horfe compleatly armed, kept 
garrifon at Bremetenracum. To this it muft be added, that there is a military 
way, though now much ruined, which goes out from Old Penrith towards 
Kefwick, but not quite fo far weft. This joined the other way that pafieth 
from blenborough by Papcaftle to Ambleiide, from whence it is moft pro- 
bable that a branch went off" to Morefby *." 

Mr. Camden has given us feveral infcriptions found at this place, which (he 
fays) he copied himfelf j the originals of which are not now to be found. 
The firft is,

Mr. Burton (from the authority of this infcription, as it feemeth) reckons 
Gadunus among our northern tutelar deities; but by the conclufion of the in- 
fcription, faciendum procuravit, Gadunus feems rather to have been the name 
of a perfon deceafed, for whom Ulpius Trajanus Martins an emeritus of the 
ala Petriana took care to have this funeral monument erected. Mr. Ward 
thinks it more likely that the emeritus was the deceafed perfon, and therefore

The reading in the third line is according to the conjecture in Camden â€¢, of 
which Mr. Horfley fays, though he cannot fay it is fatisfaclory, yet he knows 
not how to mend it. Mr. Ward thinks the three firft lines after DM Ihould

Vir qutfftcrius is one who hath been quaftor or treafurer ; in the lame manner as

PARISH OF KIRKOSWALD. 

Kirkoswald is the next parifh, but on the eaft fide of Eden. It is fo 
called from St. Ofwald, to whom the church is dedicated. 

Mr. Denton fays, it is part of that great barony which was granted to Adam 
fon of Swene, from whom it came with a daughter to Trivers lord of Burgh, 
from a daughter of Trivers to Engain, and from a daughter of Engain to Mor- 
vil. But Sir William Dugdale fays, it came (together with Lafingby) to Sir 
Hugh Morvil by marriage of his wife Helwife de Stuteville. And in difpa- 
ragement of the former account, it is well known, that Trivers married a 
daughter of Ranulph deMefchiens firfr grantee of Cumberland. â€” But however 
it came to the Morvils, it is certain Sir Hugh Morvil was in poffefllon of it, 
from whom it delcended to the Multons, and from them to the Dacres, and by 
Joan daughter of Thomas lord Dacre to Sir Richard Fynes knight, and by the 
heirefs of that family to Sampfon Lennard, and from him to Thomas Lennard 
4 lord 



424 LEETH WARD. (Kirkoswald.) 

lord Dacre, who married the lady Anne Fitzroy natural daughter of king 
Charles the fecond by Barbara duchefs of Cleveland, and by that king made 
earl of Sufiex j whofe two daughters and coheirs Barbara and Anne fold this 
lordfhip (inter alia) to Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet, father of 
Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet the prefent proprietor. 

The demefne lands here are excellent -, and let for upwards of 600 1 per annum. 
The cuftomary tenants pay about 9/ yearly cuftomary rent, and a god's-penny 
only for a tine. 

The caftle of Kirkofwald is very ancient. It was much improved by Sir 
Hugh Morvil ; who in the fecond year of king John had a grant of a market 
at this place on Thurfday weekly and inclofed the park. Thomas fon of Tho- 
mas de Multon and John de Caftro (who married his widow) enlarged this caftle 
and fortified it. Thomas de Dacre encompafied it with a large ditch for its 
better fecurity, and beautified it at a great expence. The pictures of all the 
kings of England from Brute (real or imaginary) were carried, from hence to 
Naworth caftle, where many of them yet remain. â€” Mr. Sandford, fpeaking of 
this place, fays, " Northward (from Oufby) on the river Eden ftandeth the 
" capital grand caftle of Kirkofwald, and a very fine church there, and quon- 
" dam college; now the noble manfion-houfe of the late Sir Timothy Fether- 
" ftonhaugh, colonel of the king's fide, taken at Wigan, where the late lord 
'* Witherington was (lain. Sir Timothy was taken prifoner, and executed 
" by beheading at Chefter, by the command of unworthy colonel Mitton, 
" after the faid knight had quarter given him. This great caftle of Kirk- 
" ofwald was once the faireft fabrick that ever eyes looked upon. The 
* c hall, I have feen, 100 yards long; and the great portraiture of king 
" Brute lying in the end of the roof of this hall, and of all his fucceeding 
" fuccefibrs kings of England, portraitted to the waift, their vifage, hats, fea- 
*' thers, garbs, and habits, in the roof of this hall ; now tranfiated to Naward 
*' caftle, where they are placed in the roof of the hall, and at the head thereof. 
" Thiscaftle was the ancient palace of the lord Multon marrying the lord Vaux's 
M heir, lord of Naward and Gilfland -, and afterward of the late lords Dacre ; 
" and now come by lineal defcent to the noble earl of Sufiex : with the lands 
" adjoining, and many brave parks and villages belonging thereto." 

The Fetherstonhaughs were a Northumberland family, whofe ancient 
feat was at a place of that name. Their houfe, it is faid, was formerly upon a 
hill (where are two (tones called Fether Stones) and was moated about for a 
defence againft the Scots. But upon the ruin of this, the houfe was afterwards 
built in the holme or valley under the hill, which they there call haugh ; and 
thence it was called Fetherfton haugh : and the family writ their names de Fe- 
therfton, and fometimes de Fetherftonhaugh f. 

1. The fir ft of the name that came to Kirkofwald, was Henry Fetberftonhaugh y 
fecond fon of Albany Fetherftonhaugh of Fetherftonhaugh in Northumberland 
efquire, by his wife Lucy daughter of Edmund Dudley of Yanwath in the 
Â£Ounty of Weftmorland efquire. The elder brother was Alexander, who mar-

3. Thomas Fetherjionhaugh of Kirkofwald efquire, fecond fon and heir of Sir 
Timothy, was 37 years of age at Dugdale's vifitation in 1665 ; whereby it ap-

Vol. II. I i i Staffol 



4 a6 LEETH WARD. (Kirkoswald.) 

Staffol lies between Kirkofwald and Ainftable, from the river Eden to the 
mountains, and is a fee of Kirkofwald, and gave name to a family of gentlemen 
of that place. The iffue male ended about Henry the fifth's time; and then 
the inheritance fell to three daughters, who transferred it by marriage to the 
families of Chambers, Mulcafter, and Blenerhafiet of Carlifle. It is now the 
property of the Fletchers of Hutton. 

Little Croglin {lands in the fame parifh and townfhip, and is a fee of 
Kirkofwald. It was anciently the Beauchamps till king Henry the feventh's 
time, when the Dacres lords paramount purchafed it to their feigniory. Before 
that, towards the time of Hen. i. one Uchtred held a part thereof, and Ibria de 
Trivers another part. And afterwards one Elias de Croglin, William his fon, 
and William fon of William ; who gave fome part of the fame to the houfe of 
Wetheral ; which Reginald Beauchamp confirmed : that is, the fifth part of the 
town, now called Cringledyke, which is held by leafe under the dean and chap- 
ter of Carlifle. At Sir William Dugdale's vifitation of Cumberland in 1665, a 
pedigree was delivered in by George Towry of Crogling hall in Kirkofwald 
parifh, juftice of the peace ; whereby it appears that he was of a younger branch 
of the Towrys of TQwry Hagg in the county of York â€¢, that he married Anne 
daughter and heir of William James of Carlifle, and had a fon William then aged 
â€¢ 13 years. 

Haresceugh, or Hare/cow, was given by Ada de Engain to the priory of 
Lanercoft, and Sir Hugh de Morvil confirmed the fame, in king Henry the 
fecond's time, or in the beginning of king John's reign, and before it belonged 
to Kirkofwald as parcel of that feigniory ; being bounded as followeth : " Sicut 
magna via venit de Apelbi ufque ad Ravin, et inde furfum per Ravin ufque ad 
caput ejnfdem aqua?, eta capite Ravin ufque ad Crofcrim, ct a Crofcrim ufque 
ad Hartifhevede et ufque ad Snartegill, et fie per aquam qus defcendit a Snarte- 
gill ufque ad mufTam, et deinde ufque ad ficam quae defcendit ufque ad 
Kenerhen ufque ad viam prasdictam." After that houfe or priory was dilfolved, 
Henry fon of Chriftopher fon of Sir Thomas Dacre knight purchafed it from the 
crown, and his fon or grandfon fold it to Dr. Peter Barwick phyfician in ordinary 
to king Charles the fecond, who gave it to the chapel and poor of Witherflack in 
Weftmorland. There are alfo eleven cuftomary tenants belonging thereto, 
who pay 29 s yearly rent and a twenty-penny fine. 

The church of Kirkofwald was turned into a college of 12 fecular priefts 
about the year 1523, which was not many years before the diffolution of colleges 
and other religious houfes. And the revenues thereof by the faid dilfolution 
being come into the hands of the crown, queen Elizabeth in the 29th year of 
her reign granted a leafe of the rectory to Thomas Hammond for 21 years, 
paying thereout to the vicar 8/ yearly. And in the very next year fhe granted 
the reverfion thereof to Edward Downinge and Miles Doddinge gentlemen, to 
wit, all thofe glebe lands of the rectory of Kirkofwald, and all other lands and 
tenements in the parifh of Kirkofwald, late parcel of the poffeffions of the late 

college 



LEETH WARD. (Kirkoswald.) 4?7 

college of Klrkofwald, and all the tithes of corn and grain within the faid parifh 
belonging to the faid rectory and late parcel of the poffeffions of the faid college ; 
to hold to them and their heirs as of the manor of Eaft Greenwich in free and 
common focage. 

All thefe glebe lands and tithes are now the property of the family of Fether- 
ftonhaugh, except the tithes of Staffol and Blunderfield which belong to Mr. 
Edward Towry. 

The aforefaid yearly fum of 8 /to the vicar is ftill paid by the king's receiver 
in thefe parts, and feems to have been the whole endowment of the vicarage 
after the diffolution, until the fum of 200/ was raifed by contribution of the 
parifhioners, which with 200/ more given by the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty was laid out in lands in 1725, and makes about 20/ a year to the vicar. 
And the vicarage having been again augmented in conjunction with 200/ given 
by the countefs dowager Gower, the whole revenue is now better than 40 I per 
annum. 

In the year 1246, one Martin was rector of Kirk-Ofwald; in which year, in 
a fuit between him and Ranulph de Levington and Ada his wife (which Ada 
was daughter of Joan one of the two coheirs of Sir Hugh Morvil), it was adjudg- 
ed, that they mould permit the faid Martin to have houfboot and hayboot in 
their woods of Kirkofwald (except in the woods inclofed), and common of 
pafture in the town of Kirkofwald. 

Whilft the fame Martin was rector, in the year 1263, between Simon prior of 
Norwiche complainant, and Thomas de Mukon and Ranulph de Levington 
and Ada his wife deforciants, concerning the church of Kirkofwald ; it was 
fettled, that the faid church was the right of the faid Thomas (who was fon of 
the other coheir of Morvil) and Ada, and their heirs ; fo that the faid Ranulph 
and Ada his wife prefent firft after the death of Martin then incumbent, and 
afterwards alternately the faid Thomas de Mukon and Ada and their heirs. 
And for this recognition, the faid Thomas de Mukon and Maud (Vaux) his 
wife, at the inftance of the faid Ranulph and Ada his wife, have given to the 
faid prior and his fucceffors the church of Denham, and a meffuage and grange 
and five acres of arable land there, to hold to the faid prior and his fucceffors for 
ever. 

In 1293, Walter de Langton refigning the re&ory of Kirkofwald, Thomas 
fon of Thomas de Mukon of Gilfland prefents Mr. Nicholas Lovetoft ; who, 
before he received any profits, had a writ of fequeftration for debt brought 
againft him. â€” During the incumbency of this Nicholas, in the year 1305, bifhop 
Halton held a great ordination in the parifh church of Kirkofwald, whereat 
were ordained 17 acolites, 25 fubdeacons, 26 deacons, and 21 priefts ; in all 89. 
Whereof a good many were monks of Furnefs, Holme, and other religious 
hou fes. 

In 1323, Richard de Monte fubdeacon was inftituted into the rectory of Kirk- 
ofwald, being thereto prefented by Sir John de Caftre knight (who, as is afore- 
faid, married the widow of Thomas de Mukon). In 1 371, the bifhop, being 
informed that this Richard was grown fo old and infirm' as not to be able to 

I i i 2 attend 



428 LEETH WARD, (Kirkoswald.) 

attend his cure, orders him to be cited to fhew caufe, why a coadjutor fhould 
not be afligned him. In the next year he died, and Mr. John de Appleby was 
inftituted on the prefentation of Ralph de Dacre lord ofGilfland. And the 
faid John refigning in two years after, the fame patron prefents Sir William 
Beauchamp; who upon his inftitution into Kirkofwald refigns a moiety of the 
re&ory of Aketon. 

From 1436, to 1460, William MarJIoall rector of Kirkofwald appears as a 
witnefs to feveral deeds of Thomas lord Dacre and others. 

In 152^, Mr. John Heryng, provoft of the collegiate church of Kirkofwald, 
was one of bifhop Kite's leffees at Newton. 

In 1561, on the death of Sir John Scales vicar of Kirkofwald, Sir James 
Shepherd clerk was inftituted on a prefentation by queen Elizabeth. 

In 1668, George Yeates, rector of Croglin, had a licence to ferve this cure, by 
way of fequeftrarion in the hands of the bifhop, it not being worth the expence 
of a prefentation under the great feal. In like manner, George Sanderfon, John 
Rumney, and James Wannop were fuccefiively licenfed to ferve the fame. But 
in the end, the faid James Wannop, in the year 1714, tendred a prefentation 
under the great feal, and was thereupon inftituted. 

In 1719, William Milner was licenfed to be curate. So alfo John Rumney in 
1723 : upon whofe death in 1739, John Mandeville was inftituted upon a pre- 
fentation under the great feal. 

Upon Mr. Mandeville's death in 1761, Charles Smalwood, B. A. was inftituted 
on a like prefentation. 

And upon Mr. Smalwood's death in 1771, John James, M. A. was pre- 
fented under the great feal and inftituted thereupon. 

The quire of the church feems greatly difproportioned to the adjoining body. 
Bifhop Nicolfon fuppofes it was rebuilt by fome of the lords Dacre, whofe 
feat was at the neighbouring caftle, as the arms of that family and of the Clif- 
fords are painted in moft of the windows. And he is inclined to think that it 
was put into this figure when the rectory was turned into a college ; being made 
thus capacious for the reception of the members of that fociety. He alfo fup- 
pofes, that the fpring which iffues from under the weft end of the church Mas 
the great motive for the founding of it in this place ; as the well-worfhip of the 
Saxons was notorious. 

Thebelfrey is placed without the church, on the top of an hill, towards the 
eaft, that the found of the bells might be more eafily heard by the circumjacent 
villages. 

The priory of Armathwaite had a clofe called The Holme, and fome other 
fmall poffeflions, in the parifh of Kirkofwald ; which after the diffolution were 
granted to William Greyme of Carlifle gentleman. 

In 1737, it was certified, that there were in this parifh 157 families j of which, 
prefbyterians 31.

Ainstarle, Ainftaple, Eynftable, Ajnftapelith, is a manor or lordfiiip on the 
fouth fide of Gilfland, divided from that barony by Nonhfkeugh beck; and 
reacheth from the river Eden on the weft up eaftwards into the mounrains i 
and bordereth upon Staffol lordlbip towards the fouth. 

This feigniory king Henry the firft gave to Adam fon of Sweine, from whom 
it defcended in king Henry the fecond's time to William de Neville, whofe 
lands in Cumberland in the time of king John were in the holding of Roger de 
Monte Begon, Simon fon of Walter, and Alexander de Neviile. In king 
Henry the third's time, Ainfbable lordfhip became the inheritance of John 
MafTey and Henry Terriby. Michael de Vallibus fon of David held it in the 
33 Hen. 3. And in the latter end of that king's time, Sir William Boyvill of 
Thurfby knight was lord thereof, and held the fame of Richard Neville. When 
he died, it fell to his fon John Boyvill, whofe brother Edmund fold it to Sir 
Andrew Harcla who was attainted in the 15 Ed. 2. Which king granted it to 
Sir Richard Denton (the fame probably that was very ative in feizing Sir 
Andrew), and from him it came to John Denton of Cardew, whofe pofterity 
William and John Denton enjoyed it as lords thereof fucceffively from father to 
fon, until Thomas lord Dacre (Mr. Denton fays) extorted it from the faid lafl: 
John Denton in the time of king Henry the fixth, for that the faid John Denton 
was towards the party of king Edward the fourth. Which tyranny of the 
Dacres (the faid Mr. Denton, who was a defcendent of thefe Dentons of Car- 
dew, further remarks) God feemed to take revenge for ftiortly after, when the 
faid lord Dacre and Ranulph his fon were both (lain at Towton field, or drown- 
ed in the river at Ferrybridge, when king Edward got the victory againft 
Henry the fixth, and thereby obtained the crown. Afterwards the lord Hum- 
phrey Dacre (Mr. Denton proceeds) by marrying of dame Mabil Parr daughter 
of the king's favourite Sir William Parr of Kendal caftle, recovered the Dacres 
lands; and, amongft thefe, Ainitable : which, in the partition of the Dacre 
eftate between the two fillers and coheirs of George lord Dacre, fell to the fhare 
of the younger fifter married to the lord William Howard anceftor of the pre-

Of this family of the Grahams of Nunery, the following pedigree was cer- 
tified at Dugdale's vifitation of Cumberland in 1665, beginning with the faid 
Fergus ; viz. 

1. Fergus Graham of Nunnery, a younger brother of the Grahams of 
Rofe- trees. 

2. William Graham of Nunnery, fon of Fergus, married Elizabeth Somers 
of the county of Kent â€¢, and by her had iffue George and Henry.

The church of A'inftable is dedicated to St. Michael, and is vicarial, 
having been appropriated to the faid Nunnery. It is valued m the king's 
booksÂ°at 8/ 8j 6Â±d â€¢, was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
at j:/ f and is now worth about 40 1 per annum. 

Tnere is no prefentation or intlitution to this vicarage in the bilhops regilters

appro-

appropriated to the nunnery, and fupplied by the chaplain of their own houfe. 
In 1565, on the death of Thomas Rummy vicar of Ainftable, Sir John Preeji- 
man was inftituted on the prefentation of Robert Dalilon gentleman in the 
right of his wife. 

In 1597, on the death of John Preefhnan, inftitution was given to Robert 
Watfon prcfented by Henry Barrow and Hugh Lowther gentlemen. 

In 1661, George Dacres clerk was prefented by Leonard Barrow gentleman. 

In 16S0, George Ho dgf on clerk, on the death of George Dacres, was pre- 
fented by Barbara Huggatt widow. 

In 1737, John Verty was prefented, upon George Hodgfon's death, by 
Bridget Lowthian.

fries gentleman. 

In 1 77 1, on the death of Mr. Smallwood, Thomas Railton clerk was pre-

The redlory and advowfon of this church were granted away from the 
crown in the reign of king Edward the fixth ; who by his letters patent bearing 
date the 20th day of December in the third year of his reign, grants to Tho- 
mas Peryent knight, and Thomas Rewe gentleman (inter alia) the rectory 
and church of Anaftaplethe and the advowfon and right of patronage of the 
vicarage of the faid church, late belonging to the priory of Armathwaite, 
together with all houfes, glebe lands, tithes of corn, hay, wool, lamb, and 
all other tithes to the fame belonging â€¢, to hold to them and their heirs as of 
the manor of Haft Greenwich, by fealty only, in free focage, and not in 
capite. 

The aforefaid Mr. Richard Lowthian is the prefent impropriator, and as 
fuch hath a feat in the chancel : But it is faid that the eftate at Nunnery Hands 
obliged with the repairs of the north fide of the chancel, as the vicar is with 
thofe of the fouth. 

Near the middle of the church is a large graveftone with a coat of arms 
(two bars, and three martlets in chief), which is alfo above the fouth window 
in the quire in freeftone â€¢, and round the graveftone is this legend : " Hie 
** jacet Johannes de Dentoun dominus de Aunftaple." 

Here is in this pariih a fmall parochial library; a poor (lock of 50/; and a 
fmall fchool endowed with 2/ 10 J, ilfuing out of land. 

In 1747, there were 98 families in this pariih j of which, five were 
prefbyterians. 

PARISH OF CROGLIN. 

Croglin was fo called from two Britiih words Careg (crag) a rock, and Lyn 
water. The parifh is coextenfive with the manor. It joins upon Gilfland to- 
wards the north eaft, upon the manor of Knarefdale at a place called Gyllian 

bridge 



LEETH WARD. (Croglin.) 433 

bridge towards the eaft, Renwick on the fouth, and Kirkofwald towards the 
weft. It was anciently the freehold of one Philip Haftings, in whofe iffue male 
it defcended until Edward the firft's time, and then Croglin and his other lands 
fell to his two daughters, one married to Wharton, and the other to Warcop. 

One of this family of Haftings was with king Richard the firft at the fiege of 
Jerufalem, and obtained a grant there of thefe lands. 

Croglin, from and after the faid intermarriage with Wharton, continued in 
the Whartons of Wharton hall in Weftmorland till the late duke of Wharton's 
time â€¢, and it is fomewhat remarkable, that the Whartons did not (as it is ufual 
on the marriage of heireffes) impale or quarter the arms of Haftings, but affumed 
fingly the Haftings' arms, which are the paternal arms of Wharton to this day, 
namely, Sable, a manch Argent. 

The late duke of Wharton's truftees fold this manor of Croglin to the duke 
of Somerfet (together with divers other poffeffions), whofe repreientative George 
Wyndham earl of Egremont is the prefent owner thereof. 

The number of tenants finable is about 24, who pay a yearly cuftomary rent 
of 5/ 15J od, and a ten-penny fine. There is alfo a free rent of is, and a mill 
let for about 61 a year, and the lime kilns about 1 1 / a year. 

It is faid in 1 Dugd. Mon. p. 3S9. that Uchtred fori of Lyolf gave to the 
abbey of St, Mary's York a third part of Croglin with the church there ; as is 
fpecified among the particulars in the charter of confirmation by king Hen. 2. 
â€” But this concerning the church feems to have been brought in by a Height of 
the monks; for it doth not appear that the faid abbey (or Wetheral, which 
was a cell thereof) had ever any poffeffions here, but the land which Uchtred 
had was at Little Croglin in the paridi of Kirkofwald, where the monks of 
Wetheral had fome poffeffions. And this church continued always rectorial, 
and in the patronage of the lord of the manor, until the late duke of Wharton 
fold the fame in grofs to Matthew Smales gentleman, grandfather of the prefent 
patron Henry Chaytor, LL. D. vicar of Kirkby Stephen. 

It is valued in the king's books at 8/j was returned to the governors of 
queen Anne's bounty at 47/; and is now worth about got per annum. 

In the year 1293, the bifhop confirms a leafe made of the rectory of Croglin 
by Adam the redtor, faving all dues to the crown and ordinary. And in 1309, 
another like leafe was allowed to be made by the rector Symon de Layton, for de- 
fraying the charges of affelfments for the holy-land. 

In 13 17, William de Edenhall was inftituted at Horncaflle, on a prefenration 
by Henry de Qwerton. Which laid Henry, on a vacancy in 1335, prefentcd 
'John de Wetewang. 

In 1362, Patrick de Edenham was inftituted on a prefentation by Hugh de 
Qwerton. And again in 1 577, the faid Hugh prefented John Mayfon to the 
rectory, being vacant by the death of William de Witterdby. 

In 1380, on the refignation of John Mayfon inftituted to Torpenhow, Wil- 
liam de Hoton was prfented by Sir William Beauchamp rector of Kirkofwald. - 

In 1452, Henry Staynesforlh was rector, who in that year appears as witnefs 
to a deed of lands in Aynftaplyth.

In 1527 Sir William Wharton was rector-, who in that year paid the abbot 
of Shap's compofition to the vicar of Burgh under Stanemore. 

In 1564, on the death of Sir Percival Wartbcopp, inftitution was given to Sir 
Philip Machell, who was prefented by Barnabas Machell and Hugh Machell 
gentlemen, to whom Thomas lord Wharton had granted this avoidance. 

In 1568, Sir John Hudfcn was inftituted on the death of the faid Philip 
Machell, being prefented by Richard Lowther of Lowther efquire and Thomas 
Wybergh junior of Clifton gentleman, by a like grant from Thomas lord 
Wharton. 

In 1574, on the refignation of John Hudfon, Thomas Barnes clerk was infti- 
tuted into the church of Croglin Magna or Kirk Croglin, on the prefentation 
of Gerard Lowther. Which Thomas dying in 1578, MarmaduU Cholmley was 
prefented by Philip lord Wharton : on whofe refignation in 1582, Roger 
Hajlehead was prefented by the fame patron. 

In 16? 1, on Roger Haflehead's death, John Allan was prefented by Philip 
lord Wharton. 

In 1639, on the death of John Allan, Richard Sharpies was inftituted on a 
prefentation by Philip lord Wharton. 

In 1 660, John Rogers, M. A. was prefented by the fame patron. 

In 1663, on the deprivation of John Rogers (probably for non-conformity), 
George Tates was collated by lapfe. 

In 1671, on George Yates's death, George Sander/on was prefented by the laft 
named Philip lord Wharton. 

sin 169 1, on the death of George Sanderfon, Thomas Hunter was prefented by 
the fame Philip lord Wharton, 

In 1724, on Thomas Hunter's death, Henry Noble was prefented by Matthew 
Smales gentleman. 

In this parifhare 39 families, all of the church of England. 

PARISH OF RENWICK. 

Renwick, Ravenwick, a town on the river Raven, belonged from almoft 
the time of the conqueft to a family of the name of Staveley : for kino- 
Henry the firft gave it to one Adam de Staveley and his heirs. And one. 
Thomas de Staveley and Margaret his wife held it in the 20 Ed. 1. Afterwards 
it came to the Eglesfields. And Robert de Eglesfieid, chaplain and confelfor 
to Philippa queen confort of king Edward the third, which Robert was alfo 
founder of Queen's college in Oxford, granted the fame in the 15th year of the 
faid king to his faid college then incorporated by the name of the provoft and

The church of Renwick is dedicated to All Saints. It was rectorial at the 
time of pope Nicholas's Valor, and rated at 9/ 11 s 4^. It was afterwards 
appropriated to a religious houfe at Hexham (as is commonly fuppofed) ; but 
by the grant thereof after the diffolution it mould feem that it belonged to the

ro the faid eari of Lincoln and Chriftopher Gowffe their heirs and afligns of the 
faid queen and her fuccefTors as of the manor of Eafl Greenwich in Kent, by 
fealty only, in free focage and not in capite, rendering for the fame yearly to the 
queen and her fuccefTors the fum of 1 3 s /\.d. 

Neverthelefs this probably might be a miftake, in reciting it as belonging to 
the faid abbey ; which might be occafioned by the fame grantees having pur- 
chafed divers other poffefhons belonging to the faid abbey of St. Mary's York. 
And if it had indeed belonged to that abbey, we mould probably have met with 
it amongfl: the grants or confirmations of grants to that houfe, and more efpeci- 
ally in the Regifter of Wetheral priory. 

Thefe vendees conveyed to Thomas Compton and Edward Braddil. Braddil 
releafed to Compton, and Compton again conveyed to others, and the rectory 
and tithes are now in feveral hands. A very fmall portion was allowed ail this 
while to the curate, and about the year 1749 the curacy was certified to the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty at 4/ per annum. In 1748 it received an 
augmentation of 200/ by lot from the governors of queen Anne's bounty, and 
again in 1748, wherewith lands were purchafed in the parifh of Addingham ; and 
in 1701 it received another augmentation of 200/ in conjunction with 200/ 
given by the countefs dowager Gower, wherewith lands were purchafed in the 
parifh of Ainftable : the whole being of the yearly value of about 36/ per annum. 

The revenue being for a long time fo very fmall, it would be difficult to pro- 
cure any clergyman to accept of it. And it feems that fometimes the owner of 
one part of the impropriation, and fometimes of another, hath appointed the 
curate. But unlefs a title from the crown, pofterior to the grant to the earl of 
Lincoln and Mr. Golf can be produced, the right of nomination feemeth ftill to 
remain to the crown. 

The church of Renwick was rebuilt in the year 1 733 in a very decent manner, 
at theexpenceof the parifhioners. 

There are in this parifh about 40 families, all of the church of England* 

PARISH OF OUSBY. 

Ousby, Ulne/b}\ or more properly Ulfjby* was the habitation of Ulf or Olave a 
Dane, who before the Norman conqueft. feated himfelf here under the edge of 
the eafl mountains. He was one of the three fons of Haldan ; which fons were 
Thorquell, Melmor, and Ulf. Melmor was placed at Melmerby, and Thor- 
quell (Mr. Denton fays) was placed at Thorquelby nigh Kefwiek. Near the 
time of the conqueft, this manor of Oufby feems to have been parted between 
two fifters â€¢, and fhortly after, a moiety thereof between four fillers. For in 
the time of Henry the third one Julian Falcard and William Armftrong held 
each a moiety ; and foon after, Henry le Serjeant and Patrick de Ulnefby held 
each an eighth part. The refidue by alienations was broken into fmall parcels ; 
whereof fome were given to Lanercoft, fome to the prior of St. John of Jerufa- 
lem, fome to the prior and convent of Carlifle, fome in frank marriage, and 

many

many fmall parcels fold, and distributed amongft the families of Crofton, Sal-

The church of Oufby is rectorial, and dedicated to St. Luke. It is valued 
in the king's books at 13/ 13 s $d. And is now worth about 100 1 per annum. 
The bifhop of Carlifle is patron. 

In the year 1245, Roger furnamed Peytenin a fubdeacon, and a baflard, was

In the 8 Ed. 2. by an inquifition pojl mortem of Nicholas de Vipont it was found, 
that the faid Nicholas on the day whereon he died held the capital meffuage in 
Alderftone. with 1 4. acres of arable land, and 100 acres of meadow, had 33 te- 
nants at Gerardfgill who held 31 fhieldings and paid 5/ 18s od yearly rent, 
13 tenants at Amotes-halth who paid yearly 3/ $s 4*/, 22 tenants at Nent and 
Corbrig-gate who held 22 fhieldings and paid 5/ is od rent, alfo one water 
corn miln and one fulling miln, and 3,000 acres of pafture in Aiderftone moor; 
all which premiffes were held of the manor of Werk : and that Robert Vipont 
was his fon and heir. 

In the 10 Hen. 5. Jo'.nde Clifford held the manors of Alderfton, Elryngton, 
and Gerardgill of the king in capite, paying yearly into the exchequer at Carlifle 
61 13s 4-d. 

In the 2 1 Hen. 6. Thomas Whytlav: granted the faid manors to William Stapil- 
ton and Margaret his wife. 

This William and Margaret had two daughters coheirs ; Mary married to 
Sir William Hilton of Hilton, and afterwards to Richard Mufgrave fecond ion 
of Sir Richard Mufgrave of Hartley caftie ; and Joan married to Thomas 
Mufgrave elder fon and heir of the faid Sir Richard. They were heirs of Eden- 
hall as well as of Alfton-moor. And in the 9 Ed. 4. there was a partition exe- 
cuted between Richard Mufgrave and Mary his wife of the one parr, and Johan 
relict of Thomas Mufgrave of the other part ; whereby it was agreed, that 
Alfton moor fhould go to the faid Richard Mufgrave and Mary his wife and the 
heirs of the faid Mary, and that Edenhall fhould go to the faid Joan and her 
heirs. 

Mary's heir was a fon which fhe had to her firft hufband Hilton, in whofe 
name and family Alfton moor continued till the reign of king James the firft; 
when, in the 15th year of that king, Henry Hilton of Hilton mortgaged the fame 
to Francis Ratcliffe baron of Dilfton, and foon after releafed it to him abfolutely. 
From which time it continued in the family of the Ratcliffes till the attainder of

James earl of Derwentwater in the year 17 15, upon which it became verted in 
the crown, and by acl: of parliament was fettled upon Greenwich hofpital. 

The lands in Aldfton-moor and Garrigill are moftly leafehold, granted in the 
years i6ji and 16 1 6, by the faid Henry Hilton, for 999 years, paying a twenty- 
penny fine at the end of every 21 years. 

The annual rent, by virtue of thefe leafes, payed to the receiver of the hof- 
pital is 63/. 

The number of inhabitants in this parifh, exclufive of miners that come from 
various parilhes and work 4 or 5 days in the week, is about 4,500. 

The value of the lead mines, as taken from the Moor Matter's books, for three 
years fuccefiively, appears to be as follows : In the year 1766, 18,600 byng of 
ore: In 1767, 24,500 byng : In 1768, 18,730 byng: Each byng upon an 
average being worth 2/ 15 j od. 

There are 103 lead mines leafed under the hofpital in Aldfton-moor. Six 
leafed under Mr. Emerfon of Temple Sowerby, the late Mrs. Railton, and Mr. 
Wilkinfon, in Prior's Dale. And 12, under the hofpital, Mr. Hopper, and Mr. 
Gill of Guernefey, at Tyne-head. 

Prior's Dale (as the name imports) belonged to a religious houfe at Hex- 
ham. 

That part of Tyne-head, which belongs to Mr. Gill is freehold, and be hath 
alfo the royalties. The reft of Tyne-head is held by leafe as aforefaid. 

Lord Coke, in his Second Inftitute, page 578, reports a notable cafe that 
happened in thefe mines of Aldemefton, in the 18 Ed. 1. Henry de Whiteby 
and Joan his wife impleaded feveralof the miners for cutting down and carrying 
away their trees. The miners anlwer, that they farm the mine of the king, and 
plead that for working a vein of filver (as now they do) the miners have a right 
to tatae any wood whatfoever that fhall be near to and convenient for the faid 
work, and that they have alio a right at their will and pleafure to ufe and difpofe 
of that wood for burning and inciting, and for paying the workmen their 
wages, and alfo to give what they think fit thereof to their poor workmen of 
the mine-, and they ftate, that they have exercifed their right for time imme- 
morial. The laid Henry and Joan acknowledge the miners' right to take the 
wood for burning and fmelting for the ufe of the mine, but charge, that the 
miners had cut down, carried away, and fold large quantities of wood, from 
which the king received no kind of benefit, and which never came to the ufe of 
the mine at all. And upon this they pray to have judgment. â€” It doth not ap- 
pear what was the event of the caule, nor is it now very material to inquire, for 
two reafons ; fir ft, for that by ad of parliament no mine fhall be deemed a 
royal mine, notwithstanding any gold or filver that may be found in it, only 
the king (if he pleafes) may have the ore, paying for the fame a dated price. Se- 
condly, here is now, as may well be luppofcd, fcarce a tree to be feen in the 
whole country. 

This parifh is in the diocefe of Durham, and the church was appropriated to 
the monaftery at Hexham. After the diffolution, king Edward the fixth by

PARISH OF MELMERBY. 

Melmorbv was the habitation of Melmor a Dane, who firft improved and 
cultivated the country, about the ninth or tenth century. It is a (mall manor 
and parilh, bounded on the eaft with Crofsfell and part of the bifhoprick of 
Durham, and on the other fides with the parifhes of Oufby and Adingham. 

It was parcel of the barony of Adam fon of Swene. In the reign of Hen. 3. 
Odard then lord of Wigton was feized thereof; after whofe death, his fon Walter 
de Wigton, John fon of Walter, and Margaret fole daughter and heir of the faid 
John, were fucceflively owners thereof. Margaret had two hufbands Sir John 
Gernon knight and Sir John Wefton knight, but had no iflfue. She granted

The church is dedicated to St. John, and is rectorial ; valued in the king's 
books at 12/ \is ^d: and is now worth about 80/ per annum. 

In 1332, Sir 'Thomas de Bernefion was prefented to the rectory of Melmerby 
by Dionifia relict of Sir John de Wigton knight ; and the inquifition thereupon 
taken finds the faid lady to be the true patronefs in right of her dower in the 
manors of Wigton, Kirkbride, Blackhall, and Melmerby; that her late hufband 
wasfon and heir of Sir Walter de Wigton, who laft prefenred. 

In 1334, the patronage was recovered by Robert de Parving knight from 
Margaret wife of Sir John Gernoun. 

In 1342, Thomas de Ely the rector of Melmerby, with confent of the patron

PARISH OF KIRKLAND. 

Kirkland is the next parifti, and is the eaflern boundary of the county of 
Cumberland on that fide, being divided from Weftmorland by the rivulet which 
fprings on the top of Crofsfell, and empties itfelf in the river Eden a little be- 
low Temple Sowerby bridge. Itfeems to have received the name of Kirkland t 
from its having belonged to the church of Carlifle. The townfliip itfelf of 
Kirkland is but of fmall extent, confuting of about 14 tenements holden of Sir 
Michael le Fleming baronet, all now purchafed to freehold. But there are in 
the parifh three other confiderable manors, viz. Blencarn, Skirwith, and Culgaitb. 
And the whole number of families in the parifti is about 145, all of whom are of 
the eftabliftied church. 

The church of this parifh is dedicated to St. Laurence, and was for a long 
time rectorial and in the patronage of the biftiop of Carlifle. In the reign of 
king Hen. 6. it was granted, and foon after appropriated, to the prior and con- 
vent of Carlifle; fince which time the prior and convent, and after them the 
dean and chapter, have been patrons thereof. It is valued in the king's books 
at 8 / iqs od per annum ; and may now be worth about 130/ â€” The incumbents 
thereof, fo far as appears from the bilhop's regifters at Rofe, have been as fol- 
lows : 

In 1294, Adam de Newcafllevf&s collated by biftiop Halton to the rectory of 
Kirkland ; faving to the religious men the lord prior and convent of the church 
of St. Mary of Carlifle 20 s of filver yearly due to them out of the fame. 

In 1306, Sir Gilbert de Haloghton was collated by the fame bilhop; with a 
refervation of thefaid penfion to the prior and convent. 

In 1336, William de Denton rector of Kirkland, with confent of his ordinary

to John Skelton during the life of the faid John â€¢, and in cafe of failure of fuch 
payment, he fubjects himfelf (for want of better fecurity) to the greater excom- 
munication. â€” This Skelton was a clergyman, recommended by provifo from the 
court of Rome. 

In 1 372, a demand was made of John de Langbolme rector of Kirkland, by the 
collector of the apoftolic chamber, of a provifion out of the profits of the rectory, 
on behalf of one John de Kirkby ; which the rector refufed to pay, having 
never confented to any fuch provifion. 

In 1379, on the death of John de Langholme, bilhop Appleby collates

Blenkarn, in this pariah, was parcel of the barony of Adam Fitz-Swein, and 
William de Nevill's lands at firft-, but afterwards it was granted forth in frank- 
marriage, and was hoi den of the heirs of Adam and William Nevill ; and fome 
part in frankalmoigne was granted to the priory of Carlifle. In the reign of 
king John and before, the Thurfbys of Thurfby held a moiety, and the" Whitbys 
the other moiety. In the 1 1 Hen. 3, Evon de Vipont and Sibell Thurfby 
{daughter of Adam) his wife gave fix bovates of land in Blenkarn to Bernard 
Thurfby, and fier lands in Ainltable and Waverton â€¢, all which William Boyvill

Sir Michael and his tenants. And when the late Sir William Fleming came tov 
the eftate, he and the late Mr. Crackenthorp both rode the fame felUboundary. 
But Mr Crackenthorp did not further profecute his claim, and the inhabitants^ 
of Skirwith (till enjoy the privilege of common. 

There is likewife another freehold eftate, formerly Bird's, late Adderton'Sj, 
and now belonging to John Yeates efquire-, under whom are held four cufto- 
mary tenements which pay a yearly rent of 17 s 6d. 

Culgaith was part of the large barony aforefaid given, or confirmed, by 
king Hen. 1. to Adam Mtz-Sweine fon of Alaric : which barony was holden 
â– of the king by the payment of 112s cornage. Adam's two daughters, named' 
Amabil and Matilda, were married to Alexander Crevaquer and Adam de 
Montbegon. The faid Alexander de Crevaquer granted to the monks of. 
Wetheral his moiety of the mill of Culgaith, with the miller and his family 
[cum tota feqnela prtinente]. WitneiTes of which grant were, Adam de Mont- 
begon, Robert the Sheriff, Simon de Crevaquerj and others -f-. Amabil was 
wife afterwards to William de Nevill, to whom (he had ifiiie Thomas de Burgo, 
or a daughter to him married. And Thomas had iflue another Thomas de 
Burgo, who gave or confirmed to the monks of Bredton in Yorkmire his right 
to thofe lands which William Nevill his grandfather and Amabil wife of the faid 5 
William had given unto them, and which Adam fon of Sweine gave them be- 
fore. 

The faid Thomas de Burgo the younger gave to Symon fon of Walter and; 
Sara his wife divers of the lands by fine in the 7th year of king John â€¢, in whofe- 
time Rcger de Montbegon, Symon fon of Walter, and Alexander de Nevill 
held the lards in Cumberland that were the inheritance of Adam Fitz Swein. 
The faid Roger de Montebegon was fon to Adam de Montebegon by Matilda 
his wife aforefaid. They had iflue dementia a daughter married to Long- 
viller, who feems to have been heir to Roger her brother. 

In the 16 Hen. 3. one William fon of John (by fine) gave the moiety, of .

In the '6 Ed. i. Michael de Harclay father to Andrew de Harclay earl of 
Carlific, held a moiety of Culgaith; and Walter Mulcailer and Gilbert fun of 
Robert Hawkfley held the other moiety. 

Andrew Harclay's part was forfeited by treafon in Edward the fecond's time : 
which king granted the fame to Sir Chriftopher Mort-fby knight; on wl.ofe 
death in the n Ed. 3, the inquifition finds, that the faid Chriltopher died fe 1 fed 
of the manor of Culgaith, holden of Robert Nevill of Hornby, who held in ca- 
pite by the fervice of 16 s Hd cornage. From Sir Chnltopher it defcended to 
the lady Knevctt heir general of the Pickerings and Morefbys, who fold the 
fame to Henry Crackenthorp of Newbiggin efquire, and the lands Â£0 four feof- 
fees, who afligned to the tenants. 

The lands are now all freehold, except one tenement only, which is at pre- 
fent in four or five different hands, and is holden of lieutenant-general Hony- 
wood as parcel of his manor of Mil burn Grange, under the annual rent of 
10 s gd and a twenty-penny fine. The freeholders pay a yearly quit rent of 
28 1 4s 1 d to the owners of Acorn-bank, but no court hath been holden by any 
lord of the manor for time immemorial. 

The chapel of Culgaith was founded of ancient time by the lords of the 
manor, as appears by a commiilion from the pope (which in bifhop Nicolfon's 
time was in the hands of fome of the inhabitants) directed to the bilhop of 
Carlifle, to inquire of certain neglects of duty by the redor of Kirkland in not 
faying mafs on the week days in the chapel of All Saints at Culgaith, and for 
not finding on Sundays in the faid chapel the facramental bread and holy wa- 
ter, to the peril of his foul, the damage of the inhabitants, and the diminution of

In 1739, the revenues of this chapel were certified to the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty as follows :

It was augmented in the fame year with 200/ by lot. Afterwards, John 
Dalfton of Acorn-bank efquire bequeathed 60/ to this chapel. The reverend 
Chrittopher Bowerbank rtclor of Weyhill in Hampfhire gave by his will 160/, 
to which his brother and executor added 40/ more. The late Dr. Bolton dean 
of Carlifle gave 70/ from an unknown hand. With which benefactions another 
augmentation of 200/ was procured from the faid governors of the bounty of 
queen Anne. With part of the bequefts they rebuilt the chapel, one John 
Sewell giving 10/ towards it ; and other deficiences were made up by the inha- 
bitants. The reft of the money was laid out in lands, which now procure a 
revenue to the curate of upwards of 30/ a year. And the new chapel was con- 
fecrated by bifhop Ofbaldifton in 1758. 



PARISH OF LANGWATHBY. 

Lamgwathby, Mr. Denton fays, in the ancient records is called Long-IP 'a 7 de- 
cfby ; wherein it is alfo recorded, that king Henry the firft gave it to Henry 
Fitz-Swein t together with Edenhall. Howbeit this did not long continue with 
him or his pofterity â€¢, for the king held it as a royal dcmelhe. King John had 
it in pofTeflion. Henry the third gave it to Alexander king of Scots in part of 
200 libraiesof land granted to the Scots in the year 1237, by compofuion for the 
releafe of Cumberland and Northumberland and other things in demand. The 
king of Scots enjoyed it, until John Balioll forfeited thofe lands. Thenceforth 
they continued until Richard the fecond's time in the crown : but he granted 
thofe in Cumberland to Ralph Nevil earl of Weftmorland and Johan his wife 
and the heirs of their bodies â€¢, whole grandfon Richard earl of Warwick did 
forfeit them to Edward the 4th. And he granted them to the duke of Glou- 
cefter his brother, afterwards king by the name of Richard the third. From 
which time they continued in the crown, till king William the third granted 
them to the earl of Portland, in whole family they It il 1 continue. 

Langwathby confiils of one fingle townfhip or manor. The river Eden di- 
vides it irom Edenhall on the weft. It adjoins upon Kirkland on the fouth 
and fouth eaft, and Aldingham on the north and north eaft. The tenants are 
copyholders under the duke of Portland, and do fuit and ferviceat the courts at 
Penrith, tho' they are feparated from the foreft of Englewood by the river 
Eden.

448 "LE'ETH WARD. (Langwathby.) 

As to the ecclefiaftical -flate, this feems to have been anciently part of the 
parifh of Edenhall, and therefore doth not occur in the valuations of pope 
Nicholas or of king Edward the fecond. And the church or chapel here was 
probably firft erected for want of a bridge over Eden, whereby the inhabitants 
were often hindred from repairing to divine fervice. But by length of time it 
hath gained parochial rights. And in the vifitation rolls, it is called a vicarage, 
and churchwardens are always fworn for the parifh of Langwathby. 

The church was lately rebuilt at the expence of the pariftiioners ; and the 
vicar of Edenhall officiates here and at Edenhall alternately : and enjoys the 
profits by virtue of his inftitution and induction to Edenhall. 

The revenue confifrs chiefly of about 8 acres of glebe land, 10/ a year paid 
out of the corn tithes by Timothy Fetherftonhaugh efquire the prefent lelfee, 
prefcription for tithe hay il is 1 1 d> tithe wool and lamb, and other fmall 
dues, amounting in the whole to about 25/ per annum. 

The number of families is about 36, one of which is prefbyterian. 

PARISH OF ADDINGHAM. 

â€¢Dr. Todd fuppofes this place to have received its name from a remarkable 
monument of antiquity, on the top of the hill, nigh unto the place where the 
church now ftands, a little to the north eaft of it, where there is a circle of 
Hones, fomething like Stonehenge in Wiltfhire ; and Aldingham, (Hald hing- 
ham,) he fays, fignifies an habitation nigh the hanging ftones (oppidum ad lapides 
antiquum penfiles). The circle is about 80 yards in diameter, and confifts of 
about 72 ftones, from above three yards high to lefs than fo many feet. There 
is one ftone larger than the reft, which ftands about 40 yards from the circle 
towards the fouth weft, being four yards in height and near two yards fquare 
at the bottom ; and is hollow at the top, like a difh or Roman altar. This 
the country people call Long Meg, and the reft they call her daughters. Dr. 
Todd further oblerves, that the northern people, as the Scythians, Scandians, 
and others, who were mod tenacious of ancient cuftoms, and from whom the 
Britons are more immediately defcended, did endeavour to perpetuate the 
memory of all their great affairs, as the inauguration of their kings, the burials 
of their generals and nobles, or victories over their enemies, by raifing and order- 
ing ftones and pyramids of prodigious magnitude. We are told that the election of 
a king of Denmark in ancient times was commonly had in this folemn manner: 
as many of the nobles as were fenators, and had power to give their votes, agreed 
upon fome convenient place in the fields ; where feating themfelves in a circle 
upon fo many great ftones, they gave their votes. This done they placed 
their new-elected monarch upon a (lone higher than the reft, either in the mid- 
dle of the circle, or at fome fmall diftance at one fide, and faluted him king. 
In Iceland to this day, there is fnch a company of ftones, which bear the name 
of Kingstolen, or the king's feat. Near St. Buriens in Cornwall, in a place which 
the Cornifh men call Bifcow- Woune, are to be feen 19 ftones fet in a circle, 
.diftant every one about 12 feet from the other, and in the very center one 

pitched 



LEETH WARD. (Addingham.) 449 

pitched far higher and bigger than the reft. So in Rollrich ftones in Oxford- 
ihire, the largell ftone is at fome little diftance from the circle. From all which, 
Dr. Todd concludes, that fome Daniih or Saxon king was elected here for 
Cumberland. 

All which may be very true, and yet thefe places not folely fet apart for the 
inauguration of their kings, but' for many other folemn rites and obiervances ; 
and, generally, they feem to have been the places dedicated to religious ufes. 
It is well known, that the Druids in this kingdom performed their adorations 
in the open air, and within this kind of inclofure. And the hollow or bafon in 
the top of the largeft ftone here feemeth ibmewhatto confirm this notion, as be- 
ing intended for a place of facrifice and oblation. 

Little Salkeld, a manor in this parifh, was about the year 1292 given, 
or rather confirmed, by king Ed. 1. to the prior and convent of Carlifle ; for it 
is laid that Walter the Norman had long before purchafed and given it to that 
church. The dean and chapter (who fucceeded the prior and convent) now 
hold this manor, and have a large number of tenants here and in the neighbouring 
parts, who attend their courts here, and pay about Si 14s od annual rent. 
Thofe of the tenants that are cuftomary pay a four-penny fine on change of 
tenant, but the lord never dies ; and they have all the wood growing upon their 
eftates. 

There was anciently a chapel at Little Salkeld, which in the year 1360 being 
defecrated and polluted by the fhedding of blood, and the parifh church at a 
great diftance, the vicar was allowed to officiate in his own vicarage houfe, till 
the interdict fhould be taken off from the chapel. 

Glassonby and Gamelsby in this parifh were anciently both one feigniory, 
bounded on the north by the rill or little beck that falleth from the eaft moun- 
tains weftward, through Kirkofwald parks, into Eden, which doth bound it on 
the weft-, from whence the lordfhip is extended of great breadth into the moun- 
tains, till bounded by the wafte belonging to Alfton-moor on the eaft. They 
were o-iven by king Hen. 1. unto one Hildred and his heirs, to be holden of the 
crown in capite by the payment yearly of 2 s cornage ; from whom it defcended 
to a daughter named Chriftian being ward to king John, who gave the ward- 
(hip to 'William de Ireby. She was daughter of Odard, ion of Odard, fon of 
Adeline, fon of the faid Hildred. 

William de Ireby had i flue by the faid Chriftian two daughters Chriftian and 
Eva. Eva had a rent charge out of the land, and was married to Robert de 
Eftotevil, and after to Alan de Charters. She releafed to her lifter Chriftian 
wife of Thomas Lafcells of Bolton, who had iflue Arminia married to Thomas 
Seaton, whofe fon Chriftopher Seaton forfeited the fame and other lands to 
kino- Ed. 1. by taking part with Robert Bruce and the Scots. 

The king gave his lands in Gamelfby and Unthank to William Latimer, fa- 
ther of William, who had iflue William Latimer, father of Elizabeth, wife of 
John Nevill, father of Ra'ph Nevill earl of Weftmorland j who gave his lands

in Cumberland, and divers others, to George (his fecond Ton) lord Latimer, 
' whofe daughter and fole heir was married to John lord Nevill of Raby. 

The male line failing in the reign cf Hen. 8. thefe lands fell to four coheirs ; 
from them to the Dacres â€¢, fo to Fienes â€¢, lb to Lennard earl of SufTex â€¢, fo to Sir 
Chriftopher Mufgrave baronet by purchafe from the two daughters of Thomas 
earl of SufTex. 

The church of Addingham is dedicated to St. Michael, and is vicarial; 
valued in the king's books at 9/ 4s yd, and of the prefent yearly value of about 
1 :o/. It was anciently in the patronage of the lord of the manor, as appears 
from a fine levied in the year 1245, whereby Thomas de Lafcells and Chriftian 
his wife and Eva widow of Robert Avenal fettle the manor of Gamelfby and 
GlafTenby on William de Ireby for life, and the prefentation to the church of 
GlafTenby (as it is there called) to go by turns between the laid Chriftian and 
Eva. Afterwards, the faid Chriftian being then a widow, granted the faid 
church to the prior and convent of CarliOe. And having married again to the 
lord Robert de Brus, fhe and the faid Robert in the year 1282 petition bifhop 
Irton to confirm the appropriation of the faid church and rectory, with the chapel 
of Salkeld, to the faid prior and convent, which the faid bifhop confirms ac- 
cordingly ; and ordains, that after the death of the then rector Euflachius de 
Trewick, they provide fufliciently for the fupply of the cure. And the fame 
was afterwards confirmed by bifhop Hal ton â€¢, who taxed the vicarage at 20 
marks. And finally, king Edward the firft, on the part of the crown, upon 
the grievous complaint of the prior and convent of their fufferings by the Scots, 
confirms the fame unto them f. 

In 1292, the prior and convent prefent Robert de Scardeburg, whereupon a 
commifiion de jure patronatus ifTued, Adam de Crokedayk having alfo prelented 
Richard de Longwardby ; but judgment was afterwards given in the king's 
court for the prior and convent.

PARISH OF STANWIX. 

THE fixfr. parifh in this Ward is" that of Stanwix, Stanewick, which word 
figmfies a town or village on the ftony way. It confiits of the following 
townfhips or conftablewicks, viz. Stanwix, Rickerby, Linftock, Terraby, 
Houghton, Etterby, Stainton, and Cargo. 

Stanwix is held as parcel of the manor of the focage of the caftle of Car- 
lifle. And the lands are all freehold. At this place, according to Mr. Hor- 
fley, waÂ§ the Roman ftation of Congavata, upon the courle of the wall. The 
ditch which appears diftinctly to the weft of the village, between it and the 
river Eden, feems to have been Severus's -, whofe wall has formed the north 
rampart of the ftation here, as it has generally done with refpect to the other 
ftations upon the wall. This fituation tuits exactly with thofe rules which the 
Romans obferved in building thefe ftations. For here is a plain area for the 
ftation, and a gentle defcent to the fouth, and towards the river, for the out- 
buildings. And by all accounts, and the ufual evidences, it is upon this 
defcent, and chiefly to the fouth ealt, that the Roman buildings have flood. 
Abundance of ftones have been dug up in this part-, and fome which re- 
iembled the ftones of an aqueduct. The ruins of the wall are vifible to 
the brink of the precipice, over which it feems to have paffed in going down 
to the river -f. 

Rickerby is a mefne manor under the batony of Crofby, or manor of 
Linftock, and pays a yearly quit-rent as fuch to the bifhop of Carlifle for the 
time being of 13J 4^, with fuit of court.' This little manor was anciently 
part of the Tilliols' eftate, then of the Pickerings and Weftons â€¢, of which laft 
Sir Edward Mufgrave purchafcd, and fold to Cuthbert Studholme, who con- 
veyed to the Gilpins, in whom it continued for three defcents, and is now 
moftly fold off to the tenants, and what remained of the feigniory Mr. Rt- 
chardfon of that place has purchaied.

This is one of that fort of infcriptions which are ufually found on the face

canon in the priory of St. Mary's Carlifle â– > and with the king's confent he 
gave Linftock and Carleton to that houle of religion in pure alms for ever : 
whereupon the king releafed the faid rent. And the faid Walter was made 
prior there. 

For fome time, the bifhnp and convent held all their lands in common and 
undivided. But after the firft partition made by the pope's legate Gualo, this 
barony fell to the bifhop, and Linltock caftle was his only feat for a long 
time. For fo late as the year 129 3, we find the bifhop of Carlifle entertaining 
the archbiihop of York Johannes Romanus, at his catlle of Linftock.

There are in this manor about 10 freehold tenements, which pay a yearly 
rent of 2/ 13s io[d. There are alfo about 90 cuftomary tenants who pay 
yearly 37/ 6s \\d. And about 14 leafeholders, who pay 17/ 15s lod. The 
cuftomary tenants pay only a fmall piece of current filver coin at the change 
of tenant, and nothing at the change of the lord. Yet it appears from ibrnc 
old evidences at Rofe, that they were anciently arbitrary. They alfo have ,.11 
the wood that grows upon their tenements. Twenty pounds of the faid cuf- 
tomary rents are paid for the commons which were divided and inclofed about 
the year 1707, and are held as cuftomaiy eftates, and conveyed as fuch. The 
tenants feem anciently to have been bound to the lord's miln, and it was then 
of confiderable value, but is now of very little account. 

Terraby and Houghton came anciently by marriage to the Aglionbys, 
who were lords thereof for feveral generations ; until John Aglionby efquire 
exchanged the fame with Sir John Lowther baronet, who again exchanged 
the fame with Chriftopher Dalfton efquire for the manor of Melkinthorp in 
Weftmorland, whole heir general Sir William Dalfton knight fold the fame 
about the year 1764 to the tenants. 

Etterby in old writings is called Arthuriburgum^ which feems to imply that 
it had been a confiderable village. Some affirm, that it took its name from 
Archur king of the Britons, who was in this country about the year 550 pur- 
fuing his victories over the Danes and Norwegians. But there are no remains 
of antiquity at or near this place to juftify fuch a conjecture. It now confifts 
of about 12 tenements, holden of Sir James Lowther as parcel of the barony 
of Burgh j pays 5/ yearly cuftomary renr, and arbitrary fines. 

Stainton is the next towninip, and is parcel of the manor of Weftlinton, 
and holden of Sir James Lowther ; confifts of about ten tenements, is very 
high rented, and pays a twenty-penny fine. 

Cargo, Carg-bcw, a craggy hill, is a village on the north eaft fide of the 
river Eden, between Stainton and RocklifTe. It was firft a manor and de- 
mefne of John de Lacy conftable of Chefter, who held the fame of the kino- 
immediately by cornage. This John Lacy granted the fame and Cringle- 
dyke (a territory thereunto belonging) to William de Vefcy and his heirs, 
lords of Alnwick in Northumberland and of Malton in Yorkfhire, to be 
holden of the donor and his heirs, for a mew'd hawk yearly in lieu of all fer- 
vices. William Vefcy granted it to Ewan Carlifle knight for lands in York- 
fhire, referving to him and his heirs the fame fervices. And afterwards, in 
the 2d year of Ed. 1. Robert de Rofs lord of Werk in Tindale died feifed 
thereof, having held the fame of William de Carlifle the younger, rendring 
yearly an hawk or mark of filver in lieu of all fervices. From this Robert de 
Rofs it defcended for many generations in the ifiue male, until the 3 2d year 
of Ed. 3. and fhortly after, Elizabeth Rofs the heir general transferred the 

inheritance

inheritance to the family of the Parrs of Kendal with other lands, where it re- 
mained until William Parr marquis of Northampton dying without iffue, his 
widow dame Ellin exchanged it with queen Elizabeth, and took other lands 
for her jointure. From the crown it was granted to the Whitmores ; who 
fold it to the prtfent poffeffor Jofeph Dacre efquire. 

The cfiurch is dedicated to St. Michael, and was given by Walter afore- 
faid or king Henry the firft to the church of Carlifle, and foon after appro- 
priated. The corn tithes are divided between the bifliop and the dean and 
chapter, and the bifhop hath always had the right of patronage. It is valued 
in the king's books at 9/, and is now worth 100 / per annum. 

In the year 1300, one Adam was vicar, who appeared at the county court 
and at the affizes, as the bimop's ordinary, to receive fuch as had the benefit

PARISH OF CROSBY. 

After the barony of Linjlock came to the church of Carlifle, a grange was 
â€¢ere&ed here and was called Crofby, as belonging to the church. The civil 
ftate whereof being before fet forth in Linjlock, the ecclefiaflical ftate only re- 
mains to be confidered. 

It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at 7/ 11 s id; was certified to 
the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 27/ 10s; and is now worth about 
â€¢27/ per annum. It is in the patronage of the bifliop of Carlifle. What occurs 
â– concerning it in the archives at Role, is as follows : 

In 1303, William de Infula, vicar of Crofby, gives bond to the bifhop for the 
payment of 40^ in three years time, for a certain favour to him done. What 
that favour was, feems to appear from another bond immediately following, 
which obliges him to the payment of 10/ to the bifhop or his official, if here- 
after he be found guilty of incontinency with Maud (a parifhioner of his) or 
any other woman.

PARISH OF SCALEBY. 

Scaleby is a fmall parifh, encompafied with thofe of Stanwix, Crofby, and 
Kirklinton. It hath its name from the fcales or booths made of branches of 
trees and earth, which the inhabitants erected for the fhelter and defence of 
themfelves and their flocks and herds, efpecially in the fummer time, when 
all the country round was foreft. 

When king Hen. 1. had eflablifhed Carlifle, he gave that lordfhip unto 
one Richard the Rider (fo called from his expertnefs in horfemanfhip) whofe 
name was Tylliolfe, who firft placed thofe habitations. From him it defcended 
unto Symon Tylliolfe ; whofe fon Piers (or Peter) Tylliolfey in the latter end of 
Henry the fecond's time, was ward to Jeoffrey de Lucy by the king's grant, 
and lived through the reigns of Ric. 1. and king John, and until the 31 
Hen. 3. They held the caftle and manor of Scaleby of the crown as alfo 
Houghton and Etarby. They were alfo lords of Solpart, which they held of 
Lyddal ; and of Richardby in the barony of Linftock, which they held of 
the bifhop of Carlifle. At Richardby the faid Richard their firft anceftor 
feated himfelf, whereupon it was fo called after his name. 

At that time the Scots haraffed all this country to an high degree, which 
obliged the gentlemen to dwell in Carlifle, and therefore every man provided 
himfelf with land whereon to produce grafs, hay, and corn, as near to the 
city as they might ; as this Richard at Richardby, Botchard at Bothard- 
by, Hubert the baron of Gilfland at Hubertby, Henricus father to Ra- 
nulph Engain (or grandfather to his wife Ibria) at Henrickby, Agillon at 
Aglionby, Favya widow of Robert de Grinfdale in the territory called Pavy-

Hervy) inHarveyholme afterwards called Dentonholme, and divers others. '"> 

The faid Piers Tylliolfe married the daughter of the faid Jeffrey Lucy (his 
tutor and guardian), and had iflue two fons â€¢, one named Jeoffrey after her fa- 
ther's name, who fucceeded in the inheritance, and died in the 23 Ed. 1. and 
another named Adam, that married the daughter of Henry de Cormanure, and 
by her he got the inheritance of the fixth part of Houghton. This Adam 
had Richardby for term of life, and was therefore called Adam de Richardby; 
and of that family the Richardbys are defcended. 

Jeoffrey had iflue Robert Tylliol, who purchafed a third part of Levington, 
and died in the 14 Ed. 3. He had iflue a fon Peter Piers or Tylliol, and a 
daughter Elizabeth married to Anthony Lucy. 

Robert fon of Peter and Ifabella his wife died in the 41 Ed. 3. and had iflue 
by his wife Alice a fon Piers who fucceeded him, and a fecond fon Jeoffrey 
lord of Emelton. 

Piers Tylliol fon of Robert died in the 13 Hen. 6. having enjoyed the eftate 
67 years, He had iflue one fon Robert de Tylliol who was an idiot, and died in 
the next year after his father without iflue ; whereby the eftate came to be di- 
vided between his two filters and coheirs, Ifabel and Margaret. 

Ifabel the elder After was married to John Colvil, and died in the 17 Hen. 6. 
having iflue William and Robert. 

William died in the 20 Ed. 4. without iflue male, leaving only two daugh- 
ters Phyllis and Margaret. Whereupon Robert the younger brother claimed 
the eftate by virtue of an intail â€¢, alledging that his grandfather Sir Peter de 
Tilliol had made a feoffment to the ufe of his will, and that afterwards he made 
a will, by which he ordered that William Colvil his grandfon fhould take the 
name of Tilliol, and have the manors of Houghton, Richardby, Ireby, Sol- 
part, his moiety of Newbigging, and a third part of Kirklevington, together 
with the caftle of Scaleby, to him and the heirs male of his body ; remainder 
to Robert the fecor.d fon of his daughter Ifabel in the like manner and upon the 
fame condition that he take the name of Tilliol. But Robert had not this 
will to produce, and fo was forced to go without the eftate, which was enjoyed 
by the daughters of William. Neverthelefs, to keep on foot his pretenfions, 
he aflumed the name of Tilliol. And this accounts for what we find in fome 
ancient evidences, that thefe Colvils are called Colvil alias Tilliol. And the 
late Mr. Gilpin, faid he had in his cuftody an authentic inftrument under the 
leal of the commiflary general of York, dated Sept. 27, in the 22 Ed. 4. which 
teftifies, that one Sir William Martindale knight did in the court of York, 
for the difcharging of his confcience, fwear., that he faw the will, and that it 
purported an intail as aforefaid; and that he and others, in favour of Mar- 
garet fecond daughter of the faid Peter de Tilliol had deftroyed it. Be that as 
it may, it is certain Robert failed in his claim, and the eftate defcended to the 
two daughters and coheirs of William, between whom their moiety of the 
Tilliol's lands became further divided ; viz. Phyllis, married to William Muf- 
grave, who had Crookdake for her purparty, and was anceftor of the Muf- 

grave* 



ESKDALE WARD. (Scaleby..) 459 

graves of Crookdake ; and Margaret, married to Nicholas Mufgrave brother 
of the laid William, who had Hayton (and, as it feemeth, Scaleby), and was 
anreftor of the Mufgraves of Haytori. 

This Margaret to her hufband Nicholas Mufgrave had a fon Thomas ; which 
Thomas had a fon William; which William died in the 40 Eliz. leaving iflue a 
fon and heir Sir Edward Mufgrave knight, who purchafed the other moiety of 
Sir Peter de Tilliol's lands. 

For, as was obferved before, the faid Sir Peter de Tilliol had two daughters ; 
of whom, Margaret the younger was married to James More/by efquire, who 
had iffue Sir Chriftopher Morejhy knight, who had iffue another Sir Chriftopher, 
who had iffue a daughter and heir Anne married to Sir James Pickering knight, 
who had iffue a fon Sir Chriftopher Pickering knight, who had a daughter 
and heir Anne, married firft to Sir Francis Wefton knight, fecondly to Sir 
Henry Knevet 'knight, and thirdly to John Vaughan efquire. To her firft 
hufband fhe had a fon and heir Sir Henry Wefton knight, who fold to Sir 
Edward Mufgrave aforefaid the moiety of all the lands that were the Tilliols 
below Eden, whereby Sir Edward became poffeffed of the whole. 

This Sir Edward Mufgrave rebuilt Scaleby caftle in the year 1696. William 
Mufgrave efquire his fon fucceeded ; who had iffue Sir Edward Mufgrave ba- 
ronet, who fuftained great loffes on the account of his faithful fcrvices to king 
Charles the firft and fecond, and was forced to difmember a great part of his 
eftate. He fold Kirklevington to Mr. Edmund Appleby, Houghton to Ar- 
thur Forfter of Stonegarth fide, Richardby to Cuthbert Studholme, and Scale- 
by to Richard Gilpin, who afterwards purchafed Richardby of Michael Stud- 
holme fon of the faid Cuthbert. 

Mr. Sandford (in the true fpirit of thofe times) fpeaking of Scaleby, fays, 
" It was fometime the eftate of Sir Edward Mufgrave of Hayton baronet, but 
" now fold to Mr. Gilpin a quondam preacher of the fanatical parliament, 
" and his wife Mr. Brifco's daughter of Crofton, brethren of confufion in 
" their brains, knew what they would not have, but knew not what they would 
*' have if they might chufe." 

The faid Richard Gilpin had a fon William Gilpin efquire, of whom Dr. Todd 
gives this encomium, " that he was a learned councellor at law, recorder of 
" the city of Carlifle, and a lover of antiquities, in which he was well fkilled." 

Richard Gilpin efquire, fon of William, fold Scaleby to Edward Stephen- 
fon efquire, commonly called governor Stephenfon, who died in 1768 ; and 
was fucceeded by his brother John Stephenfon efquire, who alfo died, leaving a 
fon the prefent owner, unmarried. 

There are now only three cuftomary cottages within this manor, which pay 
is yearly rent and a twenty-penny fine-, and 40 freehold tenements, which 
pay no rent, nor other fervices, but only fuit of court. 

The church of Scaleby is dedicated to All Saints, and is rectorial -, valued 
in the king's books at 7/ 12 s id; was certified to the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty at 18/3^0^; and having received an allotment of 200/ from 
the laid governors, is now worth about 30 1 per annum.

THE barcny of Levington was granted in the time of the Conqueror by 
the earl Ranulph de Mefchiens to Richard Boyvill, a commander under him 
in the royal army; which was confirmed by king Henry the firft. The faid 
Richard and his pofterity from thence took the name de Levington, and the 
chief of the family refided at Kirk Levington. And a younger brother, named 
Reginald, fettled at Wefthnron (or Weft Levington); which was enjoyed by 
hispofterity Adam. Hugh, John, and John, whole daughter transferred the in- 
heritance to Alexander Bighmore of Harbybrow, and his heirs of marriage 
in Edward the fourth's time ; and in Henry the eighth's time, one of the 
heirs of ihe faid Alexander fold the fame to the Dacres : And it is now the 
property of Sir James Lowther baronet. Another brother of the Boyvills, 
named Randolph, feaied himfelf at Randolph Levington (now corruptly Ran- 
dilinton) in Liddal barony, fo naming the place of his dwelling, which by 
his daughter in the next defcent became the Kirkbride's lands. Another bro- 
ther named Robert, was placed upon a carucate of land in Bcthcaftre, and 
thereupon was called Robert de Bothcaftre. Another brother married the 
daughter and heir of Thuifby, lord of Thurfby and of Waverton-, his name 
was Guido Bcyvill, who had iffue two fons William and John, both of them 
knights, and f< relters in Allerdale from Skawk to Elne ; which office de- 
fended unto them, from Herbert de Thurfby firft lord of Thurfby, by the 
gift of Alan fecond lord of Allerdale, fon of Waldeof. 

The faid Richard Boyvill, the eldelt brother, was fucceeded at Levington 
by his fon and heir Adam de Levington, who died about the 12th year of king 
John-, leaving ifTue Richard and Ranulph, and fix daughters, viz. Euphemia 
married to Richard Kirkbride, Margery married to Robert de Hampton, I/a- 
bel married to Patric Southaic, Eva married to Walter Corry, Julian married

Euttace de Baliol, to whom (or to whofe fon of the fame name) fhe was af- 
terwards married. 

'Ihe faid Hawife died without iflue, and her inheritance of the barony of

Tramp's purparty of this barony was in the fecond defcent fold to Robert 
Tiiliol knight, as was alfo another cf the purparties; whereby he became pof- 
fefied of one third part of the faid barony ; which from him came at lad, 
amongft other of the Tilliols lands, to the Mufgraves -, of whom Sir Edward 
Mufgrave of Hayton caftle baronet fold the fame to Edmund Appleby efquire, 
who died in 1698; leaving iffue Jofeph, James, William, and Mary. 

Jofeph Appleby efquire, fon and heir of the faid Edmund, married Dorothy 
daughter of Henry Dacre of Lanercoft efquire, who after the failure of the 
other iffue from the faid Henry, became fole heir of the Dacres of Lanercoft.' 
By her he had iffue (behdes feveral other children who died in their infancy) 
Jofeph who fucceeded his father in the inheritance, Mary married to Abraham 
Anderfon of Newcaftle upon Tyne merchant, Dorothy married to James Jack-

prefent owner of the manor of Kirklinton, being fatisfied that he might 
take the name of Dacre only, without an act of parliament, about the year 
1743, began to take it accordingly, and all his children that were then born, 
and all that were born afterwards, have gone by the name of Dacre. 

In Kirklinton are 23 cuftomary tenants, who pay yearly 1/ 17 s i^d rent,

In the year 1293, on a conteft arifing concerning the prefentation to the then 
vacant rectory of Levington (occafioned, as it feemeth, by the grÂ«rat nutnber 
of claimants from the fix fitters of Ranulph de Levington), the patronage 
for that turn lapfed to the bifhop, who collated Mr. John de Bowes. 

In 1316, upon refignation of William de Ayreminne rector of Kirklevington, 
the bifhop grants the rectory in csmmendam for fix months to Richard Ayr- 
minne. 

In 1332, upon the refignation of Robert de Tymparon, king Edward the

In 1567, on the death of Cuthbert Deane, Sir Robert Hob/on was prefented 
by William Mufgrave efquire. Which Robert Hobfon being deprived in 
1576, Sir Robert Beck was prefented by the fame patron. 

In 1584, a caveat was entered by Richard Graham of Kirklinton (commonly 
called Dick of Woodhead) on a grant made to him of the next avoidance by- 
Sir Henry Wefton knight, with a provifo that in cafe this firft turn on the death 
of Robert Beck fhould not appear to be his due, his right fhould ftand good for 
the fecond, third, or fourth avoidance. But on Beck's death in 1599, the bifhop 
collated George Watfon by lapfe. Which George refigned in 1604, and Edward 
John/on, M. A. was inftituted on the prefentation of Sir Edward Mufgrave of

Mr. David Bell built the parfonage houfe at his own expence ; and for a me- 
morial thereof put the arms of his family (three bells) over the door. 
In this parifh are 316 families ; whereof quakers 32, prefbyterians 6. 

PARISH OF ARTHURET; including the ancient parifh of 
E S T O N, and the modern parifh of KIRK ANDREWS UPON 
ESK. 

WE come now into the barony of Lyddale ; which comprehends what is

This barony was granted by Ranulph de Mefchiens to Turgent Brundey a 
Fleming, which grant was confirmed by king Hen. 1. 

In the reign of king John it was in the hands of the Stutevills ; of which 
family Sir William Dugdale gives the following account : 

i. Robert de Stutevill, in the time of William the Conqueror. 

2. Robert de Stutevill, who married Erneburga. 

3. Robert de Stutevill, whofe firfl wife's name was Helwife; and to his fecond 
â– wife he married Sibilla fitter of Philip de Valois. 

4. William de Stutevill, who married Berta niece of the famous Ranulph de 
Glanvill chief juflice of England. Which William, upon king John's ac- 
cefCon to the crown, flood in fuch high efteem with him, that he had the 
whole rule of the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland (which he 
afterwards held for divers years), as alfo that of Weftmorland, together with 
all the caftles therein committed to his truft. 

5. Robert de Stutevill, fon of William, died without iflue, in the 7th year 
of king John. 

6. Nicholas de Stutevill, fucceeded his brother Robert ; from which Nicho- 
las, the north part of this barony, which lies towards Northumberland, re- 
ceived the name of Nichol Foreft, which it bears to this day. He married 
Gunnora daughter of Hugh de Gorne, and relict of Robert de Gant ; and by 
her had iflue Jobanand Margaret, which latter was married to William Mafler, 
and died without iflue, whereby Johan the elder daughter became the fole in- 
heritrix. 

7. Johan, daughter and heir of Nicholas de Stutevill, was married to Hugh

And thus the barony of Lyddal having come to the crown, it feems to 
have continued in the fame until the reign of king James the firft; when that 
king by letters patent bearing date the 20th day of February in the firft year 
of his reign, granted to George (Clifford) earl of Cumberland, all that the 
fore ft of Nichol commonly called Nichol foreft in the county of Cumberland 
in the borders of England towards Scotland ; and alio all thole lordihips and 
manors of Arthureth, Liddel, and Kandilington, within the limits of the

cafter ; and alfo the fifhery of the water of Efk in the county aforefaid : With 
all mefiuages, mills, houfes, and hereditaments whatfoever within the faid

In like manner the faid king James, by letters patent bearing date the 31ft 
day of March in the eighth year of his reign, granted to Francis earl of Cum- 
berland, all thofe his lands called the debateable lands in the county of Cum- 
berland, abutting upon part of the fea called Solway Sands towards the fouth, 
the river of Sarke towards the weft, the Scotch Dyke towards the north, and

ter corn mills, within the limits and metes aforefaid ; and alfo the advowfon 
of the church of Kirkandrews ; to hold to the faid earl and his heirs, under

Thefe eftates were fold by the faid Francis earl of Cumberland to Richard 
Graham efquire (afterwards baronet) ; and finally king Charles the firft, by let- 
ters patent bearing date the 1 ith day of July in the fourth year of his reign, 
reciting the grants made by king James the firft to George and Francis earls of 
Cumberland, and alfo that Richard Graham efquire by virtue of aflurances and

yearly rent of 50/ for the foreft of Nichol and the manors of Arthuret, Lyd- 
dal, and Randelinton, and alfo a rent of 50 1 for the debateable lands. 

This family of Graham (otherwife written Grahme, but almoft univerfally of 
former times Grame) is defcended from the earls of Monteitl) in Scotland, of 
the name of Grahme : Whofe pedigree, approved by the Scotch heralds, and 
by Sir William Dugdale at his vifitation of Cumberland in 1665, proceeds as 
follows : 

I. Malice earl of Monteith came to that title by defcent from his mother, 
who was of the name of Stuart, and was fole heretrix of Monteith. He had 
iflue, 1. Patric Grahme, earl of Monteith; who married a daughter of the lord 
Erfkine. 2. John Grahme, from whom the principal Grahmes in the borders 
are defcended. 3. Walter Grahme, who married a daughter of the lord Mont- 
gomery in Scotland. 4. Mary, married to Archibald earl of Douglafs, and 
afterwards to Sir James Hamilton. 5. Another daughter married to Archi- 
bald earl of Argyle. 

II. John Grahme, fecond fon of Malice earl of Monteith, commonly fur- 
named John with the bright /word, upon fome difpleafure rifen againft him at 
court, retired with many of his clan and kindred into the Englifh borders in 
the reign of king Henry the fourth, where they feated themfelves, and many 
of their pofterity have continued there ever fince. Mr. Sandford fpeaking of 
them, fays, [which indeed was applicable to mod of the borderers on both 
fides] " They were all ftark mofs-troopers and arrant thieves : Eoth to Eng- 
" land and Scotland outlawed : Yet fometimes connived at, becaufe they gave 
*' intelligence forth of Scotland, and would rife 400 horfe at any time upon a 
" raid of the Englifh into Scotland. A faying is recorded of a mother to her 
*' fon (which is now become proverbial), Ride, Rowley, hough's ith' pot : that 
" is, the laft piece of beef was in the por, and therefore it was high time for 
" him to go and fetch more. â€” Late in queen Elizabeth's time, one Jock 
" (Grahme) of the Peartree had his brother in Carlifle gaol ready to be 
" hanged; and Mr. Salkeld fheriff" of Cumberland living at Corby caftlc, 
" and his fon a little boy at the gate playing, Jock comes by, and gives the 
"child an apple, and fays, Mafter will you ride; takes him up before him, 
" carries him into Scotland, and never would pare with him till he had his 
" brother home fafe from the gallows." 

This John with the bright fword married a daughter of the lord Grey of 
Fowlis ; and by her had iflue, viz. 

III. Richard Grahme, fon of John ; who, according to the Scotch pe- 
digree, had a fon, 

IV. Matthias Grahme, who had a fon Fergus. But in Sir William Dug- 
dale's pedigree there Ms a chafm between Richard and Fergus (for want of 
proofs, probably, of the connexion). Then the pedigree goes on. 

2 V. Fergus 



ESKDALE WARD. (Arthuret.) 467 

V. Fergus Gramme of Plomp. He married Sibill daughter of William 
Bell of Blacket-houfe in Scotland ; and by her had ifTue, 1. William, who mar- 
ried Anne daughter of CarliQe of Bridekirk in Scotland, and had a daughter 
Catharine married to John Armftrong of Sarke in the fame kingdom of Scot- 
land. 2. Richard. 3. Reginald Grahme, 4. Francis Grabme. 

VI. Richard Grahme, fecond fon of Fergus, when 3 youth, in the reign 
of king James the firft, went to London, and by the recommendation of fome 
friends got entertained in the duke of Buckingham's fervice; with whom he 
became fo much in favour, that the duke made him his mafter of the horfe, 
and introduced him not only to the knowledge but to the particular favour both 
of the king and prince. He was one of thofe few who were intruded 
with the fecret of the prince's going to Spain, and who waited on him thither. 
Sir Henry Wotton, in his life of the duke of Buckingham, giving an ac- 
count of their travel through France upon this occafion, relates the following 
circumftance : â€” " They were now entered into the deep time of Lent, and 
" could get no flem in their inns. Whereupon fell out a pleafant pafiage, 
" if I may infert it by the way among more ferious. There was near Bay- 
" onne a herd of goats with their young ones ; upon the fight whereof, Sir 
" Richard Graham tells the marquis (of Buckingham), that he would fnap 
" one of the kids, and make fome fhift to carry him fnug to their lodging. 
" Which the prince overhearing, Why, Richard, fays he, do you think you 
w may practice here your old tricks upon the borders? Upon which words, 
" they in the firft place gave the goatherd good contentment; and then while 
*' the marquis and Richard, being both on foot, were chafing the kid about 
*' the ftack, the prince from horfeback killed him in the head with a Scottifh 
" piftol. Which circumftance, though trifling, may yet ferve to fhew, how 
* c his royal highnefs, even in fuch (light and fportful damage, had a noble 
" fenfe of juft dealing." 

This is that Sir Richard Grahme, who purchafed the barony (as is aforefaid) 
of the earl of Cumberland. After which, he was created baronet. In the 
rebellion which began in the year 164'r, he armed in defence of his royal 
mafter. At the battle of Edgehill he received many wounds, and lay amongft 
the dead all night. He took his laft leave of the king in the iile of Wight in 
1648, and with his permifiion retired into the country, where he lived very 
private. He died in 1653, and was buried in the parifh church of Wath in 
the county of York. 

By his wife Catherine, who was daughter and coheir of Thomas Mufgrave 
of Cumcatch, he had ifiue, 1. George. 2. Sir Richard Grahme of Norton 
Conyers in the county of York baronet, from whom is defcended the prefent 
Sir Bellingham Grahme baronet. 3. Catharine, who died unmarried. 4. Mary, 
married to Sir Edward Mufgrave of Hayton caftle baronet. 5. Elizabeth, 
married to Sir Cuthbert Heron of Chipchafe in Northumberland. 6. Sufan, 
married to Reginald Carnaby of Halton in the fatd county of Northumberland 
clquire.

VII. Sir George G rah me of Netherby, baronet, married lady Mary 
Johnfton eldeft daughter of John earl of Hartfield in Scotland, who was af- 
terwards married to Sir George Fletcher of Hutton baronet. By her he had 
iffue five fons, and a daughter Margaret. The fons were, i. Richard. 2. Co- 
lonel James Grahme, whofe daughter and heir Catharine was married to Henry- 
Bowes Howard earl of Berkfhire, grandfather of the prefent earl of Suffolk, 
and Berkfhire. 3. Fergus Grahme, who left no iffue. 4. William Grahme, 
D. D. dean of Carlifle, and afterwards of Wells, who had two fons Charles 
and Robert, and one daughter Anne. 5. Raynold Grahme, who left iffue Met- 
calf Grahme of Pickhill in Yorkfhire. â€” The faid Sir George died at Netherby 
in 1657, in the 33d year of his age. 

VIII. Richard Grahme (eldeft fon of Sir George Grahme) was educated 
at Weftminfter-fchool and Chrift-church college in Oxford. In 1670 he mar- 
ried the lady Anne Howard fecond daughter of Charles earl of Carlifle ; by 
whom he had iffue, 1. Edward. 2. Catherine, married to William lord Wid- 
drington. 3. Mary, who died unmarried. 4. Sufan, who alfo died un- 
married. 

In the year 1680 he was created by king Charles the fecond vifcount Pref- 
ton in the kingdom of Scotland, and fate in the Scotch parliament under that 
title. In 1685 he was knight of the fhire for Cumberland. He was feveral 
years ambaffador at the court of France, and on his return was made mafter 
of the wardrobe and after that fecretary of ftate to king James the fecond. 
Upon the revolution he was fent to the Tower, but in a fhort time was releafed 
from his confinement; upon which, he retired to his feat at Nunnington in 
Yorkfhire. Afterwards, intending to go to king James in France, he (with 
fome others) was apprehended in a boat on the river Thames, and committed 
prifoner to Newgate. Upon his trial (which was printed) he was found guilty 
of high treafon, and received fentence accordingly â€¢, but by the interceffion of 
friends he was pardoned, and died at Nunnington in 1695, and was buried 
in the chancel of the parifh church there, under a black marble ftone, with 
this infcription, according to his own defire : " Here lies the body of Richard 
*' vifcount Prefton, fon of Sir George Graham of Netherby in the county of 
41 Cumberland baronet, who died the 2 2d day of December, A. D. 1695." 

IX. Edward Grahme, vifcount Prefton, was 17 years of age at the death 
of his father. He married Mary daughter and cobeirof Sir Marmaduke Dal- 
ton of Hawkfwell in the county of York knight â€¢, and by her had one daughter 
Anne who died young, and one fon Charles^ â€” He died at Nunnington in 1 709, 
and was fucceeded by his faid fon, viz. 

X. Charles vifcount Prefton, who was 16 years of age at his' father's 
death. He married a wife of the name of Cox, but died without iffue in the 
year 1739; and was fucceeded by his father's two lifters coheirs, Catharine 
and Mary, the other fifter Sujan being dead fome time btfore, and un-

Of the faid two coheirs, Mary died unmarried in 1753, whereby the whole

William lord Widdrington, whom (he furvived; and dying in the year 1757 
wichout ifiue, devifed the eftate to the reverend Robert Graham, M. A.

The family feat here is called Netherhy, which (lands on the fouth bank of 
the river Elk, and about five miles from the fea. Here, Mr. Camden fays, 
the ruins of fome ancient city are fo very wonderful and great, and the name 
of EJk running by them doth fo well accord, that it feems very probable the 
old Mfica flood here, in which the tribune of the firft cohort of the Aftures was 
in garrifon againlt the Barbarians. Mr. Horfley thinks, from the vaft monu- 
ments and remains of antiquity, that here muft certainly have been the Caftra- 
Exploratorum. 

Concerning the fculptures and inferiptions found here Mr. Horfley delivers 
himfelf as follows : â€” c Â« 1 muft firft take notice of a curious infeription men-

tc It was built up in the wall in a corner of the old garden, at the end of the 
u houfe. The altar feems to have been erected upon a recovery from 
" ficknefs. 

" There have alfo been found here three fculptures â€¢, the firft, Mr. Gordon 
" takes for Commodus the Roman Hercules, but from the youthful air of 
" the face, I mould rather take it for Caracalla under the appearance of Alex- 
" ander -, which emperor had fo profound a veneration for the name and me-

'â€¢ cups as that king had formerly ufed, filling the camp and Rome itfelf with 
" his ftatues. 

c ' The next fculpture, Mr. Gordon fuppofes to be the emperor Hadrian, 
" from a medal of the faid emperor in the fame attitude. The figure has a 
" corona muralis on his head, a cornucopia on his left arm, and a patera in his 
*Â« right hand, which he holds as ufual over an altar. 

" The third fculpture was in a ftair-cafe without the houfe, but juft at the 

" entrance. It is Hercules in an Armenian habit, with a cornucopia in his 
â– " left hand, and a patera in his right over an altar. Befide him on the left 

" are reprefented his club, with a boar under it, which I fuppofe was de-

About the year 1737, a remarkable altar to Fortune was difcovered here in 

an outer room of a large Roman bath, with the following infcription :

Mr. Camden fays, that where Lid joins Efk, formerly flood a caftle : Of 
this there are now no remains, nor any tradition concerning it. There is in- 
deed a ftrong fort, with a very deep double ditch, called Liddal Strength ; 
where Sir Walter Selby and 200 Englishmen were taken prifoners by David the 
fecond, king of Scots. Sir Walter would gladly have compounded for his life 
by ranfom ; but the cruel tyrant ordered his head to be ftruck off, after he 
had firft caufed his two fons to be ftrangled before his face. 

The parish of Arthuret at large, before Kirkandrews was feparated from 
it, and including alfo the ruinated parifh of Efton, according to a boundary 
thereof taken in 1624, and entered in the parifh regifler, is bounded on the north 
weft, north, and north eafl by Scotland ; on the eaft by the parifhes of Bew- 
caftle, Stapleton, and part of Kirklinton ; and on the ibuth and fouth weft by 
the river Leven or Line, and part of the parifhes of RoclifFe and Kirklinton. 

The name of Arthuret, or Arthur's head, was appropriated originally to the 
afcent whereon the church and parfonage-houfe are placed : nor is there any 
other place, village, or hamlet here that bears that name. 

The church of Arthuret is dedicated to St. Michael; and is valued in the 
king's books at \lis id. Which low valuation was owing to its fituation in 
the neighbourhood of Scotland. If the prefcriptions were abolifhed, it would 
now be worth 300/ per annum. 

Jt was given to the abbey of Jedburgh in Scotland, but by reafon of the 
almoft continual differences between the two kingdoms, the abbey feldom en- 
joyed it. In the year 1296, John Wake lord of Lyddal prefented his brother 
Baldwyn Wake to it, referving to the bifhop his ufual portion out of it. 

In 1304, Thomas de Leycejire was vicar; who exchanging in that year for 
Kirkby Stephen, Thomas de Capella was prefented by the abbot and convent of 
Jedburgh, according to the tenor of the compofition (as the prefentation ex- 
preffeth it) between the bifhop and the abbot and convent. 

In 1312, Richard de Wethermeleck was prefented by the abbot and convent.; 

In 1332, on the death of John Aurifaber (Goldfmith, or Orfeur) John de 
Penrith was inftituted on the prefentation of the faid abbot and convent, by the 
king's nomination. And, in the next year, the king prefects John de Pokelyng- 
ton to the vacant church of Arthuret, belonging (as he afTerts) 10 his p-efentation 
by reafon of the forfeiture of the abbot of Jedworth the king's rebel and ene- 
my. Whereupon the bifhop iflues a jus patromtus j who return, 1. That they

do not know that the vicarage is vacant further than that the king is pleafed to 
tell them fo. 2. Who is true patron they cannot otherwife find, than that the 
abbot and convent of Jedworth had of a long time held the faid church to their 
own ufe and ftill hold the fame. 3. They find, that his late majefty, father of 
the prefent king, did give the laft prefentation in the fame form with this. 
(And fo indeed it was : for although John de Penrith was inftituted on the abbot 
and convent's prefentation, upon the king's nomination of him ; yet there was 
Jikewife a diftinct prefentation from the king himfelf.) The event was, John 
de Pokelyngion was inftituted. 

In 1337, the faid John de Pokelyngton rector of Arthuret exchanges for the 
rectory of Glafton in the diocefe of Lincoln, whereupon Ralph de Lepyngton was 
prefented by the king to the rectory of Arthuret and inftituted thereupon. 

During all this time, though thefe feveral perfons were rectors of Arthuret, yet 
John de Penrith afore faid continued vicar. And in 1353 he makes his will, 
wherein (amongft other confiderable legacies) he gives all his veftments and con- 
fecrated clothes to the altar of St. Michael of Arthuret. 

In 1354, the bifhop nominates William de Ragenhill to the king, according 
to the tenor and effect of a compofition made of old time between the bifhop of 
Carlifle and the abbot and convent of Jedworth, and now being in the king's 
hands by reafon of the temporalties of the faid abbot and convent, praying that 
the king, as the abbot and .convent had ufed to do, will prefent the faid William 
for inftitution â€¢, which was done accordingly, and he thereupon inftituted and 
inducted. This William in the fame year refigned, and William de Arthuret was 
in like manner nominated, prefented, and inftituted. 

In 1361, John de Bouland was prefented by the king to the rectory of Arthu- 
ret, on the death of Richard de Tijfington the late rector. And in 1370, John de 
Wyke was prefented by the king, on an exchange with John de Bouland. 

In 1565, on the death of John Berwife, Six Michael Fryfel clerk was inftituted 
to the vicarage of Arthuret on the prefentation of Richard Graham of Netherby 
gentleman. 

In 1639, Cuthbert Curwen, D. D. refigns the rectory of Arthuret ; whereupon 
inftitution was given to George Conjiable, prefented by Sir Richard Graham ba- 
ronet. 

And on the death of the faid George Conftable in 1673, George UJher, B. D. 
was prefented by Sir Richard Graham baronet, grandfon of the laft Sir Richard. 

On George UJher's death in 1688, Hugh Todd, M. A. was prefented by Richard 
v.ifcount Prefton. 

In 1728, on the death of Hugh Todd, William Lindfey, M. A. was prefented 
by Charles vifcount Prefton. 

In 1735, William Lindfey refigning, Robert Graham, M. A. was inftituted 
on a prefentation by the fame patron. 

The church ftands upon an eminence towards the weftern fea. It was built 
in the year 1609 by the help of a charity brief-, having before been a mean, low, 
ruinous building, and often deftroyed by the Scots. But the perfons employed 
in the building, going off with a confiderable part of the money collected, the 

tower

Cower was left unfinifhed ; towards which, Dr. Todd the rector expended about 
60/, and procured contributions of 20/ or 30/ more. It was new roofed, flag- 
ged, and feated by the honourable Mary Graham in 1750. 

Near the church is a well of excellent water, called St. Michael's well ; it be- 
ing ufual upon the firft erection of churches, to place them near to fome fountain 
which fometimes had a confecration, and ferved for the dipping and baptizing 
of children, and other religious purpofes. 

The parfonage-houfe was built by Mr. Ufher the rector, at the expence of 
about 300/. And rebuilt by the prefent incumbent Mr. Graham in the year 
1765. 

In the churchyard is the following monumental infcription, which is fome- 
what remarkable : " Here lies the body of lieutenant William Graham of Moate 
44 efquire, who faithfully lerved the crown of England in the reigns of queen 
" Elizabeth, king James, king Charles the firft, and king Charles the fecond ; 
44 and died the 19th of May, A. D. 1657, in the 97th year of his age." 

Archy ( Armftrong) jefter to king James and king Charles the firft, often men- 
tioned in the annals of thofe times, was born in this parifh, and lies buried here 
amongft his fellow parifhioners. He was banifhed the court upon the follow- 
ing occafion : When news came to London that the Scots were all in an uproar 
about the liturgy which archbifhop Laud was for forcing upon them, the arch- 
bilhop haftening to court, Archy, as he paffed by, fays, ' 4 Who's fool now ?" 
Whereupon, prefently after, appears an order in the council book, â€” " Ordered, 
" That Archibald Armftrong, the king's fool, be banifhed the court, for fpeak- 
** ingdifrefpectful words of the lord archbifhop of Canterbury." 

Within this parifh lies a noted morafs, commonly called Solom mofs, from a 
fmall village of that name on the Scotch fide. It is famous in hiftory for the 
defeat of the Scots in king Henry the eight's time by Sir Thomas Wharton. 

In that part called Solway-Flow, in the year 1771, was a memorable outburft 
of water, mofs, gravel, fand, and (tones, which fpread over and deftroyed about 
600 acres of fine, level, fertile ground, and totally altered the face of that part 
of the country. The mofs had been obferved to have rifen imperceptibly for a 
longtime before. It began to move in the night of the 16th of November, 
and continued in motion for three days, flowly forward, fo that the inhabitants 
generally had time to get off their cattle and other moveables, before their 
houfes were buried or iendered inacceffible. The mouth of the breach was 
about 20 yards wide, and when it began to flow was in depth between 5 and 6 
yards. By this eruption, 28 families were driven from their habitations, and 
their grounds rendered totally ufelefs, and feemmgly irrecoverable, by reafon of 
the depth of covering of the morafs and other rubbifh: But by the means of 
hufhing, upwards of an hundred acres have been cleared, and by the indefati- 
gable induftry of the owner it is thought the whole will be recovered, tho' it will 
be attended with great expence. 

Out of the aforefaid mofs (Dr. Todd fays) have frequently been dug human 
bones, filver coins of the later ages, earthen pots, iron and brafs weapons, with 
oak and fir trees of unufual magnitude.

manner fworn to and confirmed by commiffioners appointed for that purpofe.

PARISH OF KIRKANDREWS UPON ESK. 

King Charles the firft, by letters patent bearing date the firft day of May in 
the feventh year of his reign, reciting that the church of Kirkandrews had been 
demolifhed, grants power to Sir Richard Graham baronet to erect, build, and 
refound a church, with all materials, in the place where the church of Kirkan- 
drews formerly flood i and by the faid letters patent doth unite, confoiidate, 
and annex the faid parifh of Kirkandrews and Nichol Forefl into one intire pa- 
rifh. â€” When Dr. Todd was rector of Arthuret, he complained of this as illegal, 
Contending that it could not be done without an act of parliament. But by the 
tenor of the grant there feems to have been a church here before â€¢, and iri an- 
cient times, in this border fituation, efpecially before the partition of the debate- 
able lands, the boundaries and diftinctions of parifhes in thefe parts perhaps 
might not be clearly defined. 

The boundary as fixed by the faid letters patent is to be on the north fide of 
the river Efke (as the current then ran) and of the two burns of Carwinley and 
Rayburn : and all tithes and emoluments within the faid limits were appropriated 
to the faid church. A great part of the lands within thefe limits were part of 
the ancient ruinated parifh of Efton, the other part of the faid parifh of Eflon 
(and Efton itfelf ) is within the prefent parifh of Arthuret. 

Sir Richard Graham having finifhed his new parifh as aforefaid, prefented 
thereto in the year 1637 Charles UJhcr, M. A. who had inftitution thereupon 
accordingly. 

In 1682, on the death of the faid Charles Ufher, William Graham, M. A. was 
prefented by (his brother) Richard vifcount Prefton. And on the ceflion of 
the faid William Graham in 1685, Edward Wilt/hire, M. A. was prefented by 
the fame patron. 

In 1730, on Edward IViltJhire' s death, William Torford, M. A. was prefented 
by Charles vifcount Prefton : and the faid Edward Wiltfhire dying in two year* 
after, Richard Baty clerk was prefented by the fame patron. 

In 1759, Richard Baty dying, Robert Graham, M. A. was inftituted to the 
rectory of Kirkandrews upon Efke, with Nichol forefl annexed, on the prefenta- 
tion of George Peacock gentleman. 

The firft fruits of that part of this parifh which lies upon the river Efke is 
fet in the faid letters patent at 3/ 11 s $d\ and that part which belongs to 
Nichol forefl at 2/. And the rectory is now worth upwai-ds of 200/ per annum v 
though there is no houfe belonging to it, nor the leaft parcel of glebe, the 
churchyard only excepted.

In Nicholforeji is a chapel oi eafe, which if it ever had any endowment, hath 
been loft (as it is not at all difficult to conceive) ; but in the year 1744 it re- 
ceived an allotment of 200/ of queen Anne's bounty, which hath fince been 
laid out in lands at Catlowdy, and now yields to the curate about 10 / per annum : 
and the prefent rector hath built an houfe for the curate. 

The families in this parifh are about 360 ; of which, prefbyterians (being fo 
nigh Scotland) above 100; but no papifts nor quakers. 

The ancient parifh of Eston hath been loft by the confufion of times, and 
is now fwallowed up by the other two. What we meet with concerning it in 
the bifhop's archives is as follows : 

In the year 1308, king Edward the fecond, as guardian of the infant heir 
of Sir John Wake, prefents Simon de Beverly to the vacant rectory of Efton, 
and inftitution was given thereupon, with a refervation of the penfion to the 
parifh church of Arthuret, if any fuch there be. 

In 1333, R- de Berewick rector of Efton had a licence of abfence for 3 years 
granted to him, with permiflion to let his living to farm for that time. 

In 1335, Thomas Wake lord of Lyddale prefents his chaplain William de 
Ormejby to the vacant rectory of Efton. 

In 1364, John de Dalton was collated by lapfe. 

The laft account we have of it is in the year 1384, when immediately upon 
the death of the faid John de Dalton the bifhop collates John de Morton to the 
rectory, as belonging to his collation in full right. 

Reginald Graham of Nunnington efquire, by his laft will and teftament 
proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury in the year 1685, bequeathed 
to his executors 200/ to be laid out in lands or other hereditaments for the ufe 
of the poor within the feveral parifhes of Arthuret and Kirkandrews. This 
money was vefted in the hands of the lords of Efke, who paid 12/ yearly for 
the fame to the fchools of the faid two pariflies. 

Mrs. Graham bequeathed 20/ each to the faid two pariflies. 

And lady Widdrington by deed in 1754, after reciting the faid annual fum 
of 12/ and the faid bequeft of 40/, granted to truftees an annuity or clear 
yearly rent charge of 40/, for the ufe of the fchools of Arthuret and Kirk- 
andrews upon Efke. 

PARISH OF BEWCASTLE. 

Bewcastle is the next parifh ; and is divided into four townfhips or con- 
ftablewicks, viz, Bewcaftle quarter, Nixon's quarter, Belbank quarter, and 
Baily quarter : And contains 240 families all of the eftablifhed church, one 
quaker only excepted. 

The parifh is commenfurate with the manor ; and is encompafTed by North- 
umberland on the north and north eaft, by Gillfland on theeaftand fouth eaft, 
by the foreft of Lyddall and part of Levington barony on the weft and fouth 

P p p 2 weft, 



47 6 ESKDALE WARD, (Bewcastle.) 

weft, and by Scotland on the north weft. It contains about 32960 ftatute 
acres, and is in length from fouth weft to north eaft about nine miles, and in 
breadth from north weft to fouth eaft fix miles. 

It is laid to have received its name from one Bueth lord or pofleffor of the 
country at and before the Norman conqueft ; who repaired an old Roman 
caftle here, and called it after his own name Bueth Caftle., and the country near 
it Buethcaftle Dale. 

Gils-Bueth, or the fon of this Bueth, laid claim to fome part of Gilfland, 
and Robert de Vallibus lord of Gilfland, fon of Hubert, flew him at a meet- 
ing for agreement appointed between them, under truft and aflurance of 
fafety. Which (hameful action made the faid Robert leave arms, and betake 
himfelf to the ftudy of the law, in which he made fuch proficiency that he 
became a judge. But this murder ftill ftuck upon his mind, until (according 
to the fuperftition of thofe times) he made fatisfaclion to holy church, by build- 
ing the abbey of Lanercoft, and endowing it with that very patrimony which 
had occasioned the murder. 

Afterwards, Bueth's lands having come to the crown, king Hen. 2. granted 
the fame to Hubert de Vallibus the laft of the name at Gilfland, whofe daughter 
and fole heir Matilda transferred the inheritance to Thomas de Mutton, who be* 
ing alfo lord of Burgh, fuffered his tenants and vaflals there to go with their 
cattle in the fummer feafon into the large waftes and mountainous part of Bew- 
caftle, the barony of Burgh at that time being well cultivated, and fitting 
better for corn and meadow. And thereupon it is always found in ancient 
inquifitions as parcel of the barony of Burgh, and to be holden of the fame: 
but it is not within the faid barony ; for the two feignories of Lyddal and Le- 
vington lie between Burgh and it. 

Afterwards it came to the Swinburns, who held it for feveral generations. In 
the 7 Ed. 1. a market and fair here were granted to John Swinburn, In Ed- 
ward the fecond's time, Adam de Swinburn held it of the lord of Burgh. And 
in Edward the third's time, Sir John Strivelin held it in right of his wife 
Jacoba, Swinburn's daughter. 

Afterwards, this caftle and manor came again to the crown ; and king Ed- 
ward the fourth granted the fame to his brother Richard then duke of Glou- 
cefter. 

In the reign of king Henry the eighth and fome of the fucceeding reigns, 
Jack Mufgrave captain * of Bewcaftle (an active man of thofe times) held the 
fame. 

Afterwards, king James the firft in the 12th year of his reign granted the 
fame to Francis earl of Cumberland for the term of 40 years, rendring for the 
fame yearly 5/. 

Finally, king Charles the firft by letters patent bearing date July 25, in the 
fifth year of his reign, of his fpecial grace, and in confideration of 200/, 
gramed to Richard Graham knight and baronet all that the caftle of Bewcaftle, 

* The word captain was of a twofold fignificatien, denoting either the commander oÂ£ a com- 
pany or troop of iciiiers, o: the governor of a town or fort, 

to 



ESKDALE WARD. (Bewcastle.) 477 

to hold to him, his heirs and affigns of the k'ng in capite by knights fervice, 
that is, by the fervice of one intire knight's fee, and rendering for the fame 
yearly yl 10s. 

In the civil war which began in the year 1641, this caftle was demolilhed, 
and the garrifon removed to Carlifle. 

In this manor are about 106 tenements, which pay yearly 16I 12s \d cuf- 
tomary rent, 2/ 17 s 8d quit rents for improvements, and 2/ ij 4 d carriage 
money. â€” By indenture bearing date May 27 in the fixth year of Charles the 
firft (and confirmed by decree in chancery), between Sir Richard Graham of 
Eike baronet lord of the manor of Bewcaftle and the feveial tenants, it is 
agreed that the tenants (hall pay a four-penny fine upon change of lord by death 
and upon change of tenant by death or alienation ; and (hall pay fuit of court, 
fuit at the lord's mill, cuftomary works and carriages, and other boons, du- 
ties and fervices accuftomed ; and that for a heriot the lord (hall have the bed 
beaft of which every tenant (hall die poflefied (the riding horfe of fuch tenant 
kept by him for trie lord's fervice only excepted) ; the tenants not to let or 
mortgage their tenements for above three years, without licence of the lord. 

At Bewcaftle was a large Roman (lation, of which there are yet fome con- 
fiderable remains. Many Roman coins alfo have been found here. Mr. Cam- 
den tells us he faw a done in the church rrrade ufe of for a grave-ftone, with 
this infcription : 

LEG II AUG Legio fecunda Augufta 

FECIT fecit. 

Mr. Horfley found another, in the churchyard, at the head of a grave, 
which was found at firft in the bottom of a grave : Which feems to have been 
an honorary monument erected to Hadrian by the fame Legio Secunda Augufta- 
and the twentieth legion. It was imperfect, but he takes the reading to be 
this: 

IMP. CAES. TRAIAN. Imperatori Csfari Trajano Ha- 

HADRIANO. AVG. driano Augufto legiones fecunda 

LEG. II. AVG. ET. XX. V. V. Augufta et vicefima valens vic- 

SVB. LI CI N 10. PRISCO. trix, fub Licinio Prifco legato 

LEG. AVG. PR. PR. Auguftali propraetore. 

As the legio fecunda Augufta was at this place in the reign of Hadrian, fo it 
is moft likely that they were quartered here at the time when his vallum was 
built, to cover the workmen, and to bear a fhare in the work. 

The church is fituate on an eminence near the caftle. It is dedicated to 
St. Cuthbert, and is rectorial. The advowfon thereof, according to Dr. Todd, 
was given about the year 1200 by Robert de Buethcaftre (perhaps the afore- 
faid Robert de Vailibus) to the prior and convent of Carlifle ; which Robert 
gave alfo lands at Buethcaftre to the priorefs and nuns of Marrig in Yorkfhire. 
The dean and chapter are the prefent patrons. It is valued in the king's 
books at 2/. It hath little or no glebe except a finall garden or twos, and the 

whole 



4 7& ESKDALE WARD. (Bewcastle.) 

whole prefent revenue (except fome fmall furplice fees) confifts of a prefcrip- 
tive payment, as it is called, of 60/ a year in lieu of all tithes, reckonings, 
and other dues. Which prefcription, from the largenefs, cannot be very an- 
cient â€¢, for at the time that prefcriptions are fuppofed ro have commenced, this 
fum was not only more than the value of the tithe, but almoft equal to the 
value of the other nine parts added to it. 

The" incumbents of this church, living obfcure in this remote part of the 
diocefe, have nothing memorable recorded of any of them. Thofe whofe 
names occur in the regiftries follow in this order. â€” In the year 1306, Robert de 
Southayke was rector, at the prefentation of the prior and convent of Carlifle ; 
who, after he had been rector fifty years, exchanged his rectory for that of 
Stapleton, whereupon Henry de Whitebergh rector of Stapleton was instituted to 
Bothecaftle. â€” In 1360, 'John de Bromfield\ on whofe resignation the next year 
fucceeded Adam /irmfirong â€” Then one Robert is rector. â€” The next is John de 
Stapilton, in ^380. â€” In the year 1580, on the death of 'Thomas Aglionby, alias 
Nickfcn, the bifhop collates IVilliam Law/on by lapfe â€” In 1623, Charles Fore- 
bench was prelented by king James the firft, the deanry of Carlifle being then 
vacant. â€” In 1643, Henry Sibfon, D. D. was rector, being in that year (amongft 
others) a contributor towards the fuftenance of the gairifon of Carlifle. â€” In 
1663, Robert Lowther, LL. B. chancellor of the diocefe was inftit ted. â€” 
Upon his death, Ambr of e Myers, M. A. in 1671. â€” To him fucceeded George 
UJher^ B. D. in 1673-, who was alfo rector of Arthuret. His fucceffor was 
James Lamb, M. A. divinity lecturer in the cathedral. â€” To him, upon his pro- 
motion to Appleby, fucceeded Jeffrey IVybergh, LL. B. in 1699. Upon whofe 
promotion to Caldbeck, fucceeded Edward Tonge, A.M. And he refigning 
in 1 71 3, Matthew Soutby was prefented. â€” On Matthew Soulby's death in 
1738, Edward Birket, M. A. fucceeded. And on his ceffion in 1758, James

In the churchyard of this place, is a crofs of one intire (tone, about five feet 
and an half high, two feet broad at the bottom, and one foot and an half at 
the top, in which top a crofs heretofore was fixed. The lord V\ illiam Howard 
of Naworth (a lover of antiquities) caufed the infcriptions thereon to be care- 
fully copied, and fent them to Sir Henry Spelman to interpret. The tafk 
beino- too hard for Sir Henry, he tranfmitted the copy to Olaus Wormius hif- 
tory profcffor at Copenhagen, who v/as then about to publifh his Monument a 
Damca. This learned antiquary in that book takes notice of the infcription, 
and prints it exactly as it was fent to him, but owns at the fame time that he 
did not- know what to make of it. Bifhop Nicolfon, in the year 1685, in a 
letter to Obadiah Walker, mafter of Univerfity college in Oxford, (which 
was printed in the Philofophical Tranfactions,) fays of it, that it is wafhed 
over, like the font at Bridekirk, with a white oily cement, to preferve it the 
better from the injuries of time and weather. On the wed fide of the flone 
are three fair draughts, which evidently enough manifeft the monument to te 
christian. The loweft of theie reprefents the portraiture of a layman, with an 
hawk or eagle perched on his arm : Over his head are the ruins of the infcrip-

his time. Next, is the picture of fome apoftle, faint, or other holy man, in a 
facerdoatl habit, with a glory round his head. On the top Hands the image 
of the blefled virgin, with the babe in her arms; and both their heads in- 
circled with glories. On the north fide is a great deal of chequer work, with 
a decayed Runic infcription. The chequer, the bilhop obferves, is the coat 
armour of the family of Vaux or de Vallibus, but this and the other carved 
work upon the crofs (he fays) muft of neceMity be allowed to bear a more an- 
cient date than any of the remains of that name and family, which cannot be 
run up higher than the conqueft. On the eaft fide are nothing but a few 
flourilhes, draughts of birds, grapes, and other fruits ; which feem to be no 
more than the ftatuary's fancy. On the fouth, flourilhes and conceits as be- 
fore ; and towards the bottom another decayed Runic infcription. When the 
fame learned prelate was again at this church, in the courie of his parochial 
vifitation in 1703, he fays he tried to recover the Runic infcription on the weft 
fide of the crofs ; but though it looked promifing, at a diftance, he could 
not afiuredly make out even fo much as that fingle line, which Sir Henry 
Spelman long fince communicated to Olaus Wormius. , 

PARISH OF STAPLETON. 

WE come now to the ancient and extenfive barony of Gilsland, Stapleton 
having been firfl: granted forth as a fee thereof. And as all or molt part of the 
remaining parifhes not yet treated of are included within that barony, it is

Stapleton, Stapilton, or Stable-town, (according to Dr. Todd) was the place 
where the Jlablejland or buckftall was, for the watching of deer, when the 
country was foreft. It appears to have been divided into two parts of very 
ancient time, viz. the manor of Solport, and the manor of Stapleton (which is 
now called the Gilfland divifion). 

The Solport divifion comprehends the conftablewicks of Solport, 'Trough, and 
Billbank. In the 34 Hen. 3. Richard de Levington (lord of Kirklevington) died 
feifed of this moiety, from whom it defcended to Ranulph de Levington his bro- 
ther, who had ifiue Hawife wife of Sir Euftace Baliol. Hawife died without 
ifiue, whereupon the Levingtons lands fell to her father's fix filters : So became 
Matilda de Carick her heir of this moiety of Stapleton. Roland Carick her fon 
fold it to Piers Tylliol'm Edward the firft's time, which defcended to the Colvils 
and Morejhys heirs of Tylliol. Finally, it came to the Grahams, in whom it 
now remains. â€” The demefne lands are called the Shank, where are the ruins of 
an old caftle. The Trough is a freehold of about 150/ a year, which was long 
in the name of the Forfters, but is now the property of Mr. Lowes attorney 
at law at Hexham. The reft are cuftomary eftatesof inheritance, about 39 in 
number, and pay a yearly rent of 11/ 14J lod, and generally a twenty-penny 
fine, but fome have been purchafed down much lower. They alfo pay heriots, 
and the lord has the wood. The miln here is alfo held as a cuftomary eftate, 
and the tenants owe fuit to it, and pay the 16th corn. 

The other moiety (being Gilfland conftablewick) belonged to the Stapletons. 
John de Stapleton was feifed thereof in the 3 Ed. 3. From the Stapletons it 
came to the Dacres, and from them to the Howards the prefent poflefiors. â€” 
There are about 24 tenants, who pay 4/ 18 j 3d yearly cuftomary rent, is 
1 1 d greenhue, and 14s fervice- money. They pay a twenty-penny fine upon 
change of lord by death, and arbitrary fines upon change of tenant by death 
or alienation. And the lord has the wood. 

The church of Stapleton is rectorial; valued in the king's books at 8/ 1 s 
uid; certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 24/, and may 
now be worth about 40/ per annum. In the year 1525, John Stapleton granted 
to Thomas lord Dacre this advowfon ; but that, clearly, mult be underftood 
only of his own moiety : for the owners of the other moiety of the manor 
prefented to the rectory in their turn both before and after. 

Jh the year 1294, Sir Gilbert de Mancheton was rector. 

In 1296, Sir Thomas de Leycejler was prefented by Sir Robert de Tilliol 

knight to the church or chapel of Solpard (as the prefentation exprefieth it)

In 1323, John de Stapleton was collated by the bilhop upon lapfe. 

In 1338, on the refignation of Sir Hugh redlor of Stapleton, Sir John de 
Kirkby was prefented by John de Stapleton. 

In ji 356, on an exchange by Henry de Whitebergh rector of Stapleton for the 
rectory of Bewcaftle, Robert de Southayke was inftituted on the presentation of 
John de Stapleton. 

In 1 361, Robert de Bolton was rector. In 1368, William de Strickland was 
rector; who exchanged with Nicholas de Stapleton rector of Ulvefby. 

In 1603, Henry Hudfon was collated by lapfe. 

In 1686, on the resignation of William Culcheth y Richard Cukheth was pre-

fented by Charles earl of Carlifle. 

In 1771, on the death of James Jackfon, who had been reflor Â£7 years, 
William Graham was prefented by the reverend Mr. Graham of Netherby. 

The number of families in this parifli is about 70-, of which 16 are quakers, 
.and 6 prefbyterians. 

PARISH OF WALTON. 

The parilh of Walton contains only about 60 families in the whole, and 
is divided into two quarters or conftablewicks, viz. Walton quarter and the 
High quarter. The town of Walton was granted by Robert de Vallibus to 
the priory of Lanercoft, at the foundation of the faid priory, by the metes and 
botinds in the grant fpecified, together with the church alfo of Walton with 
the chapel of Treverman ; as alio pafture for 30 cows in the foreft of Walton, 
and 20 fows with their young of two years, and pafture for their oxen that 
(hall till their lands there *. 

After the diflblution of the religious houfes, king Edward the fixth, by let- â€¢ 
ters patent bearing date the 28th day of June in the fixth year of his reign, 
granted to Sir Thomas Dacre the elder, knight, (amongft other pofTeffions be- 
longing to the late priory of Lanercoft) the rectories and churches of Laner- 
coft, Brampton, and divers others, with the chapel (as it is there called) of

ton : To hold to him the faid Thomas Dacre, his heirs and afligns, of the king 
in capile, by the fervice of the 40th part of one knight's fee. 

Tryermain (Treverman) aforefaid, was a fee of Giifland at the time of the 
conqueft, and one Gillande was lord thereof. He flood out againft the con- 
queror. But his fon and heir Gilmore made his peace with Ranulph de Mef- 
chines lord of Cumberland, and quietly enjoyed it in king Henry the firft's 
days, and built the firft chapel there (of wood) by licence of Athelwold firft 
bifbop of Carlifie, and by confent of Enoc then parfon of Walton Kirk, in 
whole parifh it was. He made his coufin Gilmore the firft chaplain thereof. 
After which chaplain fucceeded one Daniel ; and after him Auguftine, that 
lived in the time of Thomas parfon of Walton, which Thomas became a 
canon in Lanercoft, when this rectory became appropriated to that priory. 
After the death of Gilmore lord of Tryermaine and TorcrofTock, Hubert 
Vaux gave Tryermaine and TorcrofTock to his fecond fon Ranulph Vaux, which 
Ranulph afterwards became heir to his elder brother Robert the founder of 
Lanercoft who died without iflue. Ranulph being lord of all Giifland gave 
Gilmore's lands to his own younger fon named Roland, and let the barony 
defcend to his eldeft fon Robert fon of Ranulph. Roland had iflue Alexander, 
and he Ranulph, after whom fucceeded Robert, and they were named Rolands 
fucceffively that were lords thereof, until the reign of Edward the fourth. â€” 
That houfe gave for arms â€¢, Vert, a bend dexter, chequy Or and Gules. 

The church of Walton, having been wholly appropriated to the faid prior)}, 
is now only a perpetual curacy. In pope Nicholas's valuation, the church of 
Walton with the chapel is taxed at 50/- In Edward the fecond's valuation it 
was not taxed, becaufe it was then totally deftroyed. In Henry the eighth's 
valuation, it is not mentioned, as belonging then wholly to the priory ; and 
perhaps the country then intirely wafted. In Dr. Todd's time, the revenue 
(he fays) was not more than the wages of a common man fervant. In 1750, 
it was certified at 13/ 10s per annum. In 1767, the prefent curate, the reve- 
rend John Stamper, purchafed an augmentation from the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty ; whereby an eftate was bought within the parifh, of the pre- 
fent yearly value of 16/. â€” Whilft it was a vicarage (and not totally appropri- 
ated), it was endowed, firft by Silvefter de Everfden bifhop of Carlifle with 
the whole altarage : with which the vicar not being fatisfied, he appealed to a 
fucceeding bifhop, who fettled the fame on the fame terms, or the fum of 12 
marks at the option of the vicar on his inftitution. 

The laft vicar was Robert de Cbejler, who was inftituted on the prefentation 
of the prior and convent of Lanercoft in the year 1380; from which time, 
till the diftblution, the church was ferved with a regular canon from the 
monaftery. '

the aforefaid Sir Thomas Dacre knight grantee of the revenues of the faid 
priory.

PARISH OF IRTHINGTON. 

THE parifh of Irthington is divided into the quarters or conftablewicks 
of Irthington, Leverfdale, and Newby. It is encompafled by the parifhes of 
Brampton, Walton, Wetheral, and CrcÂ«by ; and confifts of about 146 fa- 
milies, of which 8 are quakers, and two prefbyterians. 

The church of Irthington was given by Robert de Vallibus to the prior and 
convent of Lanercoft ; and after the difiblution of the priory, was granted 
(amongft other pofieffions of the faid priory) to Sir Thomas Dacre fenior, 
knight, by king iidward the fixth in the fixth year of his reign. 

Within this parifh is the ancient fort of Pelriana^ or Cambeck fort, now 
ufually called Caftle-Jieads ; which Mr. Horfley fays is the only Roman ftation 
unto which hath been given the name of Cajlle-fteads, that being the general 
name which is ufually given to all the milliary caftella. At this place many 
Roman infcriptions have been found, of which Mr. Horfley gives a particular 
account. One is, 

C O H Cohors 

Villi nona (pofuit). 

Which (hews the ninth cohort of one of the legions to have been there. 

Another is, 

E CIVITATE CAT E civitate Cat- 

VVELLAVN uvellaun- 

ORVM T OlS orum Titus Oif- 

EDIO edio (pofuit) 

The Caffivelaun] were a people of Britain â€¢, and this fhews that (amongft 
the reft) there were Britifh foldiers in the Roman armies. 

There is another which Mr. Horfley thinks belongs to this place but was 
removed to Scaleby. It is on an altar, but partly defaced : 

SOLI Soli 

INVICTO invido 

SEX. SEVE Sextus Seve- 

RIVS. SA rius Salvator 

LVATOR Prafeftus 

.... AEF Votum folvit 

, . . LM Libens merito. 

The infcription Soli invifto is found alfo upon the medals of many of the Ro- 
man emperors. 

The three following alfo were at Scaleby, but generally faid to have come 
from this fort : 

Q^q q 2 DEO 



4^ ESKDALE WARD. (Irthington.) 

DEO SOLI MI TR Deo Soli Mitrse." 

The ancient Perfians held the fun and fire in great veneration, to both of 
which they gave the name of Mithras. From hence the name was introduced 
among the Romans. Deo Soli Mitra : that is, To the deity of the fun, whom 
the Perfians call Mithras. 

The next is, 

I _â€¢_â€¢ f . Jovi (Optimo maximo) 

COH 1111 Cohors quarta 

GALLORVM Gallorum 

C P V O L C A . . . cui prseft Volcati-

The laft of thofe at Scaleby is,, 

DEO S BE Deo fanfto Be- 
LATVCA.. latucadro 

RO AV DO...' Aulus Domitius 
...VLLINVS Paullinus 

V S Votum folvit. 

This Belatucader (as hath been mentioned before) was a local deity; and per- 
haps may be derived of Baal which fignifies a deity, and the Britifh word 
cadr which fignifies valiant; more efpecially, as Belatucader and Mars are un- 
derstood to be the fame, as in the infcription found at Netherby, Deo Marti 
Belatucadro. 

The late Jofeph Dacre Appleby efquire, owner of the ground in which the 
fort Hands, employed people for fome time in digging there, whereby he dis- 
covered feveral curiofities, which he removed to his houfe at Kirklinton. 
Amongft which were two (tones which feem to have ftood contiguous to each 
other. On one of which is carved in relievo a Victory winged, with the ufual 
drapery, treading with one foot upon a globe, with a palm branch in her lefc 
hand, a mural crown in her right, and underneath, the infcription VICTO- 
RIA AVGVSTI. On the other (tone is a fea goat above, and a Pegafus 
below ; the former to denote the maritime fituation of Britain, and the latter 
to denote the fwiftnefs of the victory. 

Another is, a (tone with an infcription, 

LEG. VI. V. F. i.e. Legio feat a viclrix fecit. 
Mr. Horfley is of opinion, that thefe legionary inicriptions which have been 
found in the ftations, were moft of them erected, when Severus's wall was 
building, at the ftations where the body of the legion quartered ; and that the 
inscriptions of the particular cohorts, that were working upon federal parts 
of the wall, were inlerted in the face of the wall at thefe feveral places. 

Another ftone, with an infcription, removed to Kirklinton, was dug up near 
the eaft entry of the ftation, where feveral pieces of broken pots or urns, with 

other 



ESKDALE WARD. (Irthington.) 485 

other reliques of antiquity, were alfo found. The infcription is fomewhat 
imperfect, but Mr. Horfley reads it, " Matribus omnium gentium^ templum olim 
'* vetuftate conlapfum, Cuius Julius Pitanus provincia prafes refiituit" â€” Mr. 
Ward thinks the firft word to be Vicloribus, and that the rebuilding of this 
temple was after the many and great victories gained by Diocleflan and Max- 
imian. 

Another infcription belonging to this place is upon an altar which was re- 
moved to London, and in Mr. Horfley's time was in the poffeflion of the earl 
of Hertford : 

DEO SANG M Deo fando Marti 

ARTI VENVSTIN Venuftinus Lupus 

V S L V P V S V S L M votum folvit libens merito. 

Within this parifh alfo is Watch-crofs, which Mr. Horfley takes to be the 
Aballaba of the Romans, where according to fome was a Roman ftation, others 
(from its convenient fituation for an extenfive profpect) think it was only an 
exploratory fort. And to this purpofe it feems to have been made ufe of in 
more modern times, from its being named Watch- crofs. It is about four chains 
and an half fquare, and is a little detached from the wall to the fouth. At 
this place have been found two infcriptions ; one of them imperfect, which 
Mr. Horfley reads " Centuria cohortis Silii Aucinii pofuit." The other is as 
follows, 

LEG II AVG Legionis fecundas Auguftas. 

y IVLI . TE centuria Julii Tertulliani 

RTVLLIA (pofuit)*. 

The church of Irthington (as aforefaid) was granted to the prior and con- 
vent of Lanercoft, who foon got it appropriated to their houle. And the 
bifhop Walter Malclerk in the year 1224 taxed the vicarage as follows; viz. 
the vicar to have the whole altarage, with the corn tithe of the vill of irthing- 
ton, and all the land belonging to the faid church, with the tithe of hay and 
mills throughout the whole parifh, with all fmall tithes belonging to the altar- 
age : Saving to the prior and convent yearly three efkeps of oatmeal and two 
efkeps of malt. Which was afterwards altered by bifhop Chaufe to one efkep 
and an half of oatmeal. 

In pope Nicholas's Valor, the church of Irthington is rated at 13/ 16s od 
and the vicarage at 10/. â€” In Edward the fecond's Valor, nothing; becaufe 
they were totally deftroyed. â€” In Henry the eighth's taxation, the vicarage of 
Irthington is rated at 61 is $\d. â€” It was certified to the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty at 30/; and may now be worth about 40 / per annum. 

In the year 1224, William de Meleburn was inftituted to this vicarage on the 
prefentation of the prior and convent of Lanercoft. â€” In 1337, Laurence de 
Caldrt\ and feveral others afterwards, on the like prefentation of the prior and

convent. â€” After the diffolution, on the death of Sir John Farebarne vicar of 
Irthington, in 1567, inftitut'ron was given to Sir Robert Hut ton clerk, but the 
patron is not named. On whofe death in 1585, Sir Robert Dob/on clerk was 
collated upon lapfe. And he refigning four years after, Leonard Scott was in- 
ftituted on the prefentation of Chriftopher Dacre of Lanercoft efquire. 

In 1597, on Leonard Scott's death, Jofeph Lowden, M. A. was collated 
upon lapfe. And on his death in 1612, Sir Richard Lowden clerk was pre- 
fented by Henry Dacre efquire. 

In 1642, on the refignation of Anthony Salkeld the late vicar, Richard Sib - 
fon, B. A. was prefented by Sir Thomas Dacre knight, and inftituted by Ifaac 
Singleton and John Hafty, maftcrs of arts, commiffioners of archbilhop 
Ufher.

In 1731, on John Goiling's death, Matthew Wilkinfon was prefented by 
Sufanna Maria Dacre Appleby. 

In 1745, Matthew Wilkinfon dying, James Farijh clerk was inftituted on a 
^prefentation by Jofeph Dacre efquire. 

In 1763, on the ceflion of the laid James Farilh, John Stamper clerk was 
prefented by the faid Jofeph Dacre efquire. 

PARISH OF BRAMPTON. 

Brampton, by Camden and fome others, is fuppofed to be the Bremeten- 
racum of the Romans, which being only conjectural from fome fimilitude of 
the names, others have rejected this fuppofuion, efpecially as there hath ap- 
peared no good evidence that ever there was a Roman ftation at Brampton : 
And Mr. Horfley places the Bremetenracum at Old Penrith.â€” \n this parifh (ever 
fince the building of Naworth caftle at leaft), was the chief refidence of the 
lords of the great barony of Gilfland ; whofe hiftory it is proper here in the 
firft place to delineate : 

I. Ranulph de Mefchiens, in the time of the Conqueror, granted this ba- 
rony of Giitland to one Hubert a Norman, who took.his name from the 
place. Gill in this country dialect fignifies a dale or valley, which is the fame 
as the latin word vallis, from whence the French had their word vaulx. And 
from the time of this gram, the faid Hubert was promifcuoufly ftyled Hubert 
Vaulx or Hubert de Vallibus. He had two brothers Ranulph deUprightby 
and Robert de Daljlon, both of them fo called from the place of their habitation. 
From this family at Gilfland did defcend by younger brothers, divers other 
families, zsVculxof Tryermain, of Ainftapileth, of Catterlen, and of Cald- 
beck. At the time of the conqueft and before, this barony, or a great part of 
it, belonged to one Bueth, whofe fon Gilbert fon of Bueth (commonly called 
Gib Bueth) was driven out by the conqueror. And king Henry the firft re- 
8 granted 



ESKDALE WARD. (Brampton.) 487 

granted and confirmed Bueth's lands to the faid Hubert and his heirs, to hold 
by the fervice of two knights fees, with thol, and theam, and foe, and fac, and 
infangthief, and freedom from noutegeid *. 

This Hubert was a kinfman or follower of the faid Ranulph de Mefchiens, 
and ferved under Ranulph's brother William de Mefchiens here in Gilfland. 
After he was poiTeffed of the barony peaceably, he gave divers parcels thereof 
by the name of manors, as Denton to one Wefcop, Farlam to one Wesfalam, 
Kirkby to one Odard, and divers other manors and lands there, fome to the 
ancient inhabitants, and others to his friends and kinfmen. Such as hefo pre- 
ferred, he bound by alliance and marriages to his houfe, and by all other good 
means he could devife. Yet his new reconciled enemies'continued but a fhort 
time his friends. For in king Stephen's time, when the Scots tnder their 
king David and earl Henry his fon poffeffed the county of Cumberland, they 
flood with the ancient heir Gils bueth againft Hubert's title.

II. Robert de Vallibus, fon of Hubert, fucceeded his father. On king 
Henry the fecond's obtaining the crown of England, he took Cumberland 
again from the Scots, and Robert entred to the barony of Gilfland. And the 
faid king by his charter confirmed the fame to him, as king Henry the firft 
had done to Hubert father of the faid Robert. Witneffes of which grant 
were, Bartholomew bifhop of Exeter, Henry elect of Bath, Richard arch- 
deacon of Poictou, earl Geoffrey, and many others : Dated at Windfor. â€” And 
the fame was likewife confirmed to him by king Richard the firft in the firft 
year of his reign. 

This Robert de Vattibus, at a meeting (then called a Triji, that is, in truft 
and confidence) for deciding their differences, had bafely murdered the afore- 
faid Gills-bueth ; of which he forely repented afterwards, and for expiation 
thereof founded the priory of Lancrcoft in Gilfland. He was a learned man, 
and well (killed in the laws of this realm; and in the 24 Hen. 2. was juftiee 
itinerant in Cumberland with Ranulph de Glanville and Robert Picknell his 
afTociates.

In the 15 Hen. 2. he paid two marks for two knights fees (whereby he 
held Gilfland), upon levying the aid for marriage of the king's daughter; and 
in the 1 8th of the fame king he paid 40s fcutage of thefe knights fees, in re- 
gard he was not in that expedition which the king made into Ireland. 

In the 21 Hen. 2. he â–  was fheriff of Cumberland, which county that year 
yielded no benefit to the king by reafon of the war. He was alfo governor of 
Carlifle at the fame time; and after a long fiege laid thereto by William 
king of Scotland, wanting victuals, was neceflitated to come to this conclufion, 
viz. that if king Henry did not relieve him before Michaelmafs, he would then 
render it. And he continued fheriff of that county from the 22 to the 30 
Hen. 2. inclufive. 

To the canons of Carlifle he gave the church of Hayton, with one carucate 
of land there. 

In the 23 Hen. 2. he was one of the witnefies to that memorable award then 
made by king Henry, for appeafing the differences between Aldephonfus king 
of Caftile, and Sanclius king of Navarre, touching divers caftles and ter- 
ritories. 

He married Ada daughter and heir of William Engaine, and widow of Si- 
mon de Morville ; and by her had ifTue a fon, viz. 

III. Robert de Vallibus; who in the 1 2 Joh. gave the king 750 marks 
for regaining his favour. Wherein he had offended doth not appear j but in 
the 1 6 Joh. he gave another fine of 6661 1 3 s 4 d to pacify the king. 

IV. To this Rcbert fucceeded Ranulph de Vallibus, his brother, in the 
feigniory of Gilfland ; who had a ion and heir; viz. 

V. Robert de Vallibus, to whom in the 17 Joh. the cuftody of the 
county of Cumberland and caitle of Carlifle were committed. Which Robert 
foon after took part with thofe barons then in arms againft the king, as it 
feemeth : for before the end of that year, all his lands in Cumberland, Nor- 
folk, Suffolk, Somerfet, and Dorfetfhire were feized on by the king, and given 
to Robert de Veteripont. But thofe ftorms being over, in the 6 Hen. 3. he 
took upon him thecrofs, and went on pilgrimage to Jerufalem ; having licence 
to let his lands for the term of three years after he began his journey, accord- 
ing to a conftitution of the Lateran council. In this fame year he paid four 
marks upon levying the firft fcutage of king Hen. 3. for the two knights fees 
he held in Gilfland. And in the 13 Hen. 3. he paid other four marks for the 
fcutage in that year. In the 18 Hen. 3. he executed the office of fheriff for 
the county of Devon, for the firft quarter of that year. 

VI. To this Robert fucceeded Hubert de Vallibus Ins fon; who left ifTue 
one fole daughter and heir called Maud, who was married to Thomas de 
Multon, whereby the barony of Gilfland came to that family. 

The arms of Vaux were; Argent, a bend checquy Or and Gules.

This Thomas de Multon was fon of Thomas de Multon by his fecond wife Ada 
daughter and coheir of Sir Hugh de Morville. He had by his faid wife Maud 
a fon called Thomas de Multon of Gilfland, who died in the 21 Ed. 1. leaving 
a fon Th-mas de Multon of Gilfland, who died two years after his father ; leav- 
ing ifiue another Thomas de Multon of Gilfland, who died in the 7 Ed. 2. leav- 
ing only a daughter Margaret de Multon lady of Gilfland, married td 
Ranulph de Dacre of Dacre caftle in Cumberland, whereby that great in- 
heritance was transferred to the Dacres; in whom it continued in the male line, 
till the death of the laft male heir, George lord Dacre of Gilfland, Grayftock, 
and Wemm, who left three filters coheirs, one of whom died unmarried, and 
the inheritance was divided between the two furviving filters, Anne married to 
Philip earl of Arundel eldeft fon of Thomas Howard duke of Norfolk, and 
Elizabeth married to the lord William Howard third fon of the faid duke 
â– of Norfolk. In the partition of the eftate, Gilfland fell to the (hare of the

king Charles the firft, and two daughters, Elizabeth married to Bartholomew 
Fromond of Cheam in the county of Surrey, and Alathea married to Thomas 
vifcount Fairfax of the kingdom of Ireland. This Sir Philip died before his

Naward castle is the principal feat of the barons of Gilfiand in thefe 
parts. It is built fquare, with towers at each corner, and was enlarged and 
improved out of the ruins of the caflles of Irthington and Kirkofwald. Dr. 
Todd fays, there were brought from Kirkofwald, and put up on the roof or 
wooden ceiling of the great hall here, the heads of all the kings of England 
from Brute to king Henry the fixth, elegantly painted, in good and lafting 
colours. 

In and about the garden at this place, in Mr. Horfley's time, was a good 
number of fculptures and Roman infcriptions, which have been fince removed, 
and where they are now to be found we know not. Mr. Horfky's account of 
them we have inferted in the feveral places from whence they were brought. 

King Henry the third, in the 37th year of his reign, granted to Thomas de 
Multon lord of Gilfiand a weekly market at Brampton on Tuefday, and a fair

Bleffed Virgin Mary *. At which place are held annually courts leet and- view

ton, Irthington, Leverfton, Newby, Afkerron, Walton wood, Trcdermaine, 
Hayton, Cumwhitton, Carlatton, Caftle Carrock, Cumrew, Farlam, Denton, 
Nether Denton, and 1 alkin. The manors of Lanercoft, Brackenthwaite, and 
Newbiggin are alfo within the limits of the faid barony, but Lanercoft having 
been formerly granted to the priory of Lanercoft in frankalmoine, and Bracken- 
thwaite in Newbiggin difmembered by Joan the female heir of Thomas lord

The general cuftoms of Gilfland are, to pay fines arbitrary upon defcents 
and alienations, but upon the death of the lord to pay a twenty-penny fine: 
only. No furrender nor admittance is ufed, but the lands pafs by deed only 
with the lord's allowance thereon. Widows are intitled to a third of all the 
lands that their hufbands died polTclTed of, but lofe the laid third upon their 
marriage. In none of the manors are heriots paid, except only in Nether Den- 
ton-, and if there are no live goods, they pay 2/ in lieu thereof. 

In the 12 Geo. 3. an act of parliament paiTed, which probably will make & 
great alteration in the tenure of thefe manors : It is intitled " An act to im- 
** power cercain perfons to infranchife feveral cuftomary lands and heredita-

" earl of Carlifle deceafed, and fettled to certain ufes by the will of the faid- 
" Henry earl of Carlifle j and for other purpofes therein mentioned." 

The church of Brampton is dedicated to St. Martin, and is vicarial. It 
ftands about a mile weft from Brampton, and no houfe near to it but the vicar's 
manfe. At the foundation of the priory of Lanercoft, it was given by Robert 
de Vallibus to that houfe, and foon after appropriated thereto. And about 
the year 1220, Hugh bifhop of Carlifle endowed it with the whole altarage, 
and the tithes, oblations, and obventions belonging to the faid altarage, and 
the lands belonging to the fame with the tithes thereof *. 

In pope Nicholas's taxation in 1291, the church of Brampton is valued at. 
18/, and the vicarage at 8/. In Edward the fecend's taxation in 1318, the 
church is valued at 1 /, and the vicarage at nothing becaufe it was totally de- 
stroyed. In Henry the eight's valuation the vicarage is rated at 8/; and is- 
now worth 100 / per annum or upwards. 

After the diffolution of the religieus houfes, this church with the advowfon 
thereof was granted (amongft the other polTefllons of the priory of Lanercoft) 
to Sir Thomas Dacre fenior knight, and is now the property of the right ho- 
nourable the earl of Carlifle. 

In 1334, Richard de Caldecotes was vicar-, upon whofe death in 1346", John

There was an hofpital in the town of Brampton founded by the late earl 
Edward (or his countefs, who it is fuppofed was the firft mover) and endowed 
fo as to fubfift in Dr. Todd's time, 6 poor men and 6 poor women, called: 
brethren and fitters. The houfe was built into 12 chambers or apartments for. 
the 12 eleemofynaries, each of whom was allowed 6/ a year, a long gown, 
and wood for fire. And an allowance of 12/ a year was provided for the fup- 
port of a perfon to perform divine fervice in their chapel, and to teach fchool; 
The nomination of the faid poor perfons and curate to be in the earl of Car- 
lifle. But this inftitution was dropt by the late earl or his father. However, 
the chapel remains, and the parochial fervice is performed there for the moft 
parr,, the parifli church being at fo great adiftance, and in a very ruinous con- 
dition- 
Near the town ftands a large round hill, commonly called die Moat, of the 
height of about' 50 yards,, gently and gradually tapering from the bafis to the 
iummit. At the top there is a trench or ditch round it. Dr. Todd fuppofes 
that this regular ftructure was at firft railed by the Britons and ancient idola- 
trous inhabitants j and that it was defigned by them for an open confpicuous 
public altar or place of facrifice. 

The number of families in this parifli is about 250 ; of which 52 are pref*

THE parifh of Cumwhitton is bounded by the river Eden on the weft, 
by Crofby fields in the parifh of Wetheral to Hood's nook on the north, by 
the rivulet called Cam and hy Carlatton and Cumrew on the eaft, and by 
Croglin water on the fouth. 

The earl of Carlifle, as lord of Gilfland, is lord of the manor; has near 
80 tenants, who pay 13/ gs 4^ cuftomary rent, a twenty-penny fine at change 
of lord by death, and an arbitrary fine upon change of tenant by death or ali- 
enation. They owe fuit to the lord's court, and pay each one (hilling yearly 
in lieu of other fervices. They alfo pay 1/ $s if d in confideration of paying 
only half moulter at the lord's mill. And the lord claims the wood. 

There are two eftates within this manor that pay 17 s yearly cuftomary rent 
to the lord of Corby, and a twenty-penny fine. Alfo {even others that pay 
about 3/ yearly cuftomary rent to Mr. Atkinfon of Carlifle, with a twenty- 
penny fine. 

When pope Nicholas's Valor was taken in the year 1291, this church was 
rectorial, and valued at 8/ 14.J od. In Edward the fecond's, 1318, it con- 
tinued rectorial, but was not taxed by reafon of its poverty. Afterwards it 
was given (but by whom we have not found) to the prior and convent of Car- 
lifle, and wholly appropriated to them. And their fucceftors the dean and 
chapter now nominate a curate to officiate, who is licenfed by the bifhop ac- 
cordingly. 

They let out upon leafe from time to time all that the reclory or parfonage 
of Cumwhitton, and all their glebe land, and meadow called Kirk Crofts, to- 
gether with all tithes, oblations, obventions, offerings, duties, payments, 
rights, cuftoms, ufages, profits, and advantages, to the fame belonging, un- 
der the yearly rent of 15 efkeps of havermeal and 10 s in money ; the curate's 
houfe and garden not included in the faid leafe, and the leflee to pay to him 
moreover 10/ yearly, and to difcharge all dues and duties ordinary and extra- 
ordinary. The parilhioners do not pay tithe corn in kind, but certain quan- 
tities of meal in lieu thereof. 

The curacy has been augmented with 200J by lot, which was laid out in 
lands at Catlowdy within the manor of Nicol Foreft, which yields now up- 
wards of 9/ a year -, and hath fince been augmented with 400/ more (200/ 
whereof was given by the counttfs dowager Gower) â€¢, wherewith lands were

On the fummit of the Fell, is a place called the Grey Tawd. It confifts of 
about 88 pretty large fparry ftones fet nearly in an exact circle of about 52 
yards in diameter. One fingle ftone, larger than the reft, ftands out of the 
circle about 5 yards to the north-weft. We have mentioned feveral of the like 
kind in other places, which by divers good judges of antiquity are underftood 
to have been places of Druid worfhip, 

Upon the face of a rock, about half way up a fteep hill, that hangs over 
the river Gelt, in this parifii is a Roman infcription, which Mr. Horfley en- 
deavours to make out as follows :

Vexillatio Legionis fecund*, Augufia, ob virtutem appellata ; fub Agricola 
sptione. 

Apro et Maximo confulibus â€¢, ex officina Mercatii, Mercatus filius Fir mil. 

Aper and Maximus were confuls when Severus's wall was built. And from 
the nature of the ftone, Mr. Horfley conjectures that a large quantity of ftones 
for the wall was fetched from this place : And that the ninth and tenth cohorts 
of the legio fecunda Augufia were employed in this quarry, and about the wall 
in thefe parts. â€” An optio was a fort of deputy to a centurion or other officer, 
who acted for him in his abfence. 

The number of families in this parifh is about 80 ; of which two are papifts,, 
two prefbyterians, and one quaker.

In the year 1315, Henry de Burgh prior of Lanercoft being dead, the fub- 
prior and his brethren petition the bifhop of Carlifie, then refiding at Horn- 
caftle, to grant a commiffion to fome within his own diocefe to confirm their 
choice of a new prior, that they might not be put to the trouble and expence 
of a long journey for fuch confirmation : Whereupon the bifhop immediately 
fends fuch commiffion to his official. The prior that was chofen upon this oc- 
cafion was Robert de Meburn. â€” The manufcript Chronicle of Lanercoft in the 
Britifh Mufeum reports that the abovefaid Henry de Burgh was a famous 
poet : But none of his works have reached to our time. 

In 1337, on the death of the prior William de Southayke, the convent chufe 
John de Bowetbby, a canon and facrift of their church, and prefent him to the 
bifhop ; who decrees the election to be canonical, confirms it, and fends out 
his mandate for the inftallation of the new prior.

In the very next year, on Saturday before St. Luke's day, the fubprior and 
convent met capitularly, and chofe John de Bothecaftre to be their prior, in the 
place of the faid John de Bowethby deceafed. Whereupon the fubprior imme- 
diately in the chapter houfe declared and pronounced, in the name of himfelf 
and all his fellow canons, the faid John de Bothecaftre to be duly elected. Af- 
terwards, application was made (as ufual) to the bifhop, who confirmed the 
election, and gave a mandate to the vicar of Brampton (one of the canons) 
for his installation. 

In the year 1354, the faid John de Bothcafire refigned in form in the chapter 
houfe before the bifhop, who was called thither as their vifitor on that occa- 
fion. The caufe affigned was old age and infirmities, fuch as rendered him 
incapable of continuing in the government. Whereupon the vifitor decrees 
him decent lodgings in the priory, a competent allowance of other neceflaries 
and conveniences for life, to which the convent oblige themfelves by their 
unanimous fubfeription. And in his place was chofen Thomas de Hextildejham\ 
to whom the bilhop (as ufual) adminiftred the oath of canonical obedience, 
and moreover obliged him by folemn promife not to frequent public huntings, 
nor to keep fo large a pack of hounds as he had formerly done. â€” The oath 
of canonical obedience was in this form : " In Dei nomine, Amen. Ego 
" frater Thomas de Hextildefham, prior prioratus de Lanercoft, ordinis 
** fancti Auguftini, Karliolcnfis diocefeos, ero fidelis et obediens vobis vene- 
** rabili in Chrifto patri ac domino meo Domino Gilberto Dei gratia Karlioli 
" epifcopo et fucceiToribus veftris canonice intrantibus, officialibus, et mini- 
" Itris, in canonicis et licitis mandatis : Sicut Deus me adjuvet et hasc fancta 
*â€¢ Dei evangelia. Et hoc propria manu mea fubferibo." 

In the very next year, the faid prior Thomas died. And the canons of La- 
oercoft had great difputes and heats among themfelves concerning the choice 
of a fuccelTor; infomuch that the bilhop thought it neceflary to fend letters 
requifitory, under pain cf the greater excommunication, commanding them to 
pay an exact canonical obedience during the vacancy to the fubprior : Who 
with his party demanded Richard de Rydal, a canon regular of St. Mary's Car- 
lifie to be their prior; whilfl another party declared that themfelves had fairly 
chofen a canon of their own priory one John de Nonyngton into the place. The 
bifhop was appealed to, and the caufe heard at Rofe ; where fentence was given 
for Richard de Rydal, and his poftulation confirmed. And he fwore canonical 
obedience as above. 

In the year following, whether on occafion of the laft year's tumults, or 
otherwife, the bifhop folemnly vifited the prior and convent of Lanercoft ; 
and his monition, appointing a certain day for their attending him for that 
purpofe in their chapter houfe, bears date at Rofe the 6th of May 1356. 
And in the very next fummer the bifhop vifits this houfe again, as well as the 
priory of St. Mary's Carlifle, and the cell at Wetheral. 

In 1360, prior i?j^/abfenting himfelf from his priory, the bifhop con ftitutes 
Martin de Brampton one of the canons guardian thereof during his abfencej 
with a charge of faithfully accounting for his adminiftration, when thereunto 

lawfully 



E S K D A L E WARD. (Lakircost.) $oi 

lawfully required. â€” And this is the laft account of the priory that is to be 
found in the regifters of the bifhops of Carlifle at Rofe- 

After the diffolution of the religious houfes, king Henry the eighth, by 
letter patent bearing date Nov. 22. in the 34th year of his reign, granted to 
Thomas Dacre of Lanercoft efquire, in confederation of his true and faithful 
fervices, all that the houfe and fite of the late monaftery or priory of Laner-

This Sir Thomas Dacre went commonly by the name of Bajlard Dacre, being 
an illegitimate fon of Thomas lord Dacre of the North. Hence the Dacres 
of Lanercoft bore in their arms the bar of difference, or baftard bar. â€” In the 
year 1559, this Sir Thomas repaired the manfion houfe, and caufed the fol- 
lowing verfes to be painted in the glafs of the window in the dining room 
(which are now in the eaft window of the parifh church) :

Whether 



ESKDALE WARD. (Lanercost.) 

Whether it was a miftake of the author of thefe quaint lines, or Sir Thomas 
Dacre intended to have it underftood that king Edward the fixth gave unto 
him the priory, and that king Henry the eighth only intended to have done 
fo; or that king Henry the eighth gave it, and king Edward the fixth con- 
firmed the fame to him ; it is certain this was not the cafe. The objects of 
the two grants were feparate and diftincl. King Henry gave the priory with 
the demefne and other lands in the parifh of Lanercoft. King Edward gave 
the rectories and advowfons of the churches. The difference was; kino- 
Henry's grant was to him and the heirs male of his body, king Edward's 
grant was abfolute to him and his heirs. 

The pedigree of the faid Sir Thomas Dacre is as follows : 

Sir Thomas Dacre of Lanercoft knight married a daughter of Denton, 
and by her had iffue two fons, Chrijlofher and John ; the latter of whom 
died without iffue. 

Christopher Dacre of Lanercoft efquire, fon and heir of Sir Thomas, 
married Alice daughter of Knevet, with whom he had a leafe of Scaleby for a

would take and ufe the name of Dacre, which Jofepb was grandfather of the 
prefent Jofepb Dacre of Kirklinton efquire, heir general of this family of the 
Dacres of Lanercoft. 

Dr. Todd fays, upon the death of the faid James, it was difputed, and a 
controverfy was then depending in law, to whom the right of the fite and de- 
mefne of the diffolved priory did belong. But from the tenor of the afore- 
faid grants it appears, that this being within the grant of king Henry the 
eighth, which was only to the heirs male of the body of Sir Ibomas Dacre, 
and the male line here failing, it reverted to the crown, and is now in leafe 
to Frederic the prefent earl of Carlifle. 

Courts baron are held here in the name of the faid earl. There are about 
13 freeholders, and 64 cuftomary tenants. The latter pay a twenty-penny 
fine certain, and no heriots or other fervices. The lands pafs by deed, furrender, 
and admittance. "Widows are intitled to thirds of what their hufbands die 
poffeffed, but lofe the fame if they marry. 

The conventual church has been large, and fomewhat magnificent. A 
fmall part of it is now only ufed by the parifliioners ; the reft is in ruins. Having 
been wholly appropriated to the priory, it remains only a perpetual curacy, 
and was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 14/ 5s, and hath 
fince received an allotment of 200/ from the faid bounty. The earl of Car- 
lifle is patron (probably by purchafe from the Dacres). 

The number of families in this parifh is about 300 -, whereof 15 are pref- 
byterians, 2 quakers, 2 anabaptifts, and 2 papifts. 

Burdoswald, the Amboglana of the Romans, is in this parifh, and is a 
very large and remarkable fort, at which place more inferiptions have been 
found, than at any other Roman ftation. Mr. Horfley exhibits no fewer 
than twenty -five that had been found here, but feveral of them removed from 
hence to Naward, Scaleby, and other places. They are moftly upon altars, 
and near one half of them inferibed to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and other 
deities, by the Cohors prima Ailia Dacorum which was ftationed here. Many 
of them are yery imperfect. Thofe which are moft perfecl, or otherwife re-

At a place called Sbaws in this parifh, from the foot of a rock breaks out a 
medicinal fountain, which from the beneficial virtues of its water is called 
Holywell. Dr. Todd fays, it is deeply impregnated with faline and fulphureous 
particles, and on that account has a cathartic and emetic virtue. Perfons who 
are affected with cutaneous diforders, refort hither in great numbers in the 
fummer months, and commonly go away relieved. Dr. Short clafles it amongft 
the fulphureous waters, and fays it contains a very confiderable proportion of 
fulphur, a fmall quantity of fea fait, and a very little earth.

PARISH OF KIRK-CAMBOCK. 

Kirk-Cambock is (or rather was) a fmall parifh, encompaffed by thofe of 
Lanercoft, Bewcaftle, and Stapleton. In Henry the fecond's time one Alfred 
de Cambock held it. Afterwards, in Henry the third's time, the Tirryes (or 
Tyrers) held it. And in Edward the firft's time one Richard Tyrer held it of 
1 nomas de Multon then lord of Gifland, by the 8th parr, of one knight's fee. 
After him, Thomas de Lever/dale, and Thomas his fon. In the 36 Ed. 3. Ro- 
bert de Lever/dale and William Stapelton held it. And by an inquilition pcfi mor- 
tem in the 36 Hen. 6. it is found, that William Stapleton died feifed of the 
manor of Camboke with the advowfon of the church there, holden of Tho- 
mas lord Dacre lord of Gilfland, but by what fervices the jurors know not. 
It is now holden of Frederic earl of CarliQe, as part of Gilfland ; and the 
cuftomary tenants pay an annual rent of it 2s 6d, and a twenty-penny fine 
upon change of lord by death, and a fine arbitrary upon change of tenant by 
death or alienation. 

The church of Kirk Cambock is rectorial ; and was given to the prior and 
convent of Carlifle, but when or by whom we have not found. In pope 
Nicholas's Valor it is rated at 8/. In king Edward the fecond's, nothing. Jn 
king Henry the eighth's it is not mentioned, being then wholly appropriated 
to the priory, and the parifh almoft deftroyed and ruinated by the Scots. 

In the year 1259, Randolph de Tylliol was rector of Camboke, in which year 
a boundary was fettled between this parifh and that of Lanercoft f. 

In 1 304, on the death of Simon de Tyrer rector of Camboke, two presta- 
tions were made to the bifhop. The prior and convent of Carlifle prefented 
Alexander de Crokedake, and Richard de Tyrer prefented another Simon de Tyrer. 
By an inquifition de jure patronatus it was found, that Henry de Tyrer father 
of the faid Richard prefented the laft incumbent, his own fon ; but that there 
was an agreement, under feal, between the prior and convent of Carlifle and 
him the faid Henry, concluding an alternate right of prefentation. This in- 
strument being produced and fubmitted to, it was determined that the faid 
prior and convent have the prefent turn, and the faid Richard and his heirs the 
next. Whereupon inftitution was given to Alexander de Crokedake. And in 
the year following, the church becoming vacant, Symon de Tyrer was inftituted 
on the prefentation of Richard de Tyrer; faving to the prior and convent of 
the cathedral church of Carlifle a yearly penfion of 2s due and of old time 
accuftomed. 

In 1386, bifhop Appleby collated John de Southwell by lapfe. And this is 
the laft account that is given of this church in the bifhops regifters. 

The fabrick of the church hath long been- in ruins, nothing remaining of 
it but part of the old walls. No curate is appointed to rake care of the paro- 
chial duties. For the rites of baptifm and fepulture, the people commonly

repair to the church of Lanercoft ; and for their inftrudlion in religion, they 
go thither, or to Stapleton, or Bewcaftle, or where they think fit. 

The redory is granted by the dean and chapter of Carlifle, by leafe for 21 
years, by the delcription of " All that their church or chapel of Kirkcam- 
" mock, with all houfes, glebe lands, oblations, obventions, profits, and 
" commodities whatfoever to the faid church or chapel belonging or apper- 
" taining â€¢," under the fmall yearly rent of five (hillings : And the leffees cove- 
nant to repair the faid church or chapel and houfes â€¢, and alfo to find and pro- 
vide an able and fufficient curate to ferve the place during the term of the 
leafe, and yearly to allow the ftipend or wages which the ordinary for the time 
being fhall appoint and think fit 5 and alfo to difcharge all other duties ordi- 
nary and extraordinary to the faid church or chapel belonging or apper- 
taining. 

Why this church hath not been certified to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty, and thereby put into a way of augmentation, we have heard no 
reafon afligned. 

PARISH OF FARLAM. 

Farlam is a fmall parifh, in the very extreme parts of Gilfiand towards the 
eaft. It was granted in king Henry the fecond's time by the lord of Gilfland 
to one Walter de Windfor, brother of Alexander de Windfor. The faid Walter 
de Windfor had ifTue another Walter. And his fon, called Adam de Farlebam, 
held this land in Edward the fecond's time. And in Edward the third's time, 
John de Farlebam held it; who, having no children, devifed the fame to Ra- 
nulpb de Dacre and Margaret Multon (lady of Gilfland) his wife, and to their 
heirs. And from thenceforth it hath continued as demefne to the lords of 
Gilfiand. â€” The Arms of thefe Windfors were -, Argent, a faltier Sable. 

John de Windfor, brother to the fecond Walter, enjoyed Little Farleham. 
He had ifiue Rayner and Solomon. And Rayner had Bernard, father of Ri- 
chard, who endowed the houfes of Wetheral and Lanercoft with lands in 
Little Farleham. 

The church of Farleham is dedicated to St. Thomas -, and was given by 
Robert de Vallibus to the priory of Lanercoft. 

In the year 1251, Silvefter de Everfharn bifhop of Carlifle, having fet out a 
portion for the vicar, viz. all the profits of the church except the tithe corn and 
except a moiety of the glebe lands, afterwards thinking that too little, he 
afligns to him the other moiety alfo, except one acre, in the following form : 
" Omnibus Chrifti fidelibus prgefentes literas infpecturis, Silvefter miferatione 
divina Karliolenfis epifcopus minifter humilis, falutem in domino. Noverit 
univerfitas veftra, quod cum ex officio noftro ad taxationem vicariffi de Far-

** pneter unam acram terras eifdem priori et conventui ad asdificandum quan- 
" dam gra'ngiam affignandas-f." 

In 13 1 6, on the death of Sir Simon de Walton vicar of Farlam, William de 
Richardby was instituted on a prefentation by the prior and convent. 

In 1 361, on the death of the vicar Sir Thomas de Derby, Sir Thomas Roks 
was inftituted on a like prefentation. 

In 1373, Sir Thomas Roke refigns â€¢, and Sir Robert de Hayton chaplain is in 
like manner prefented and inftituted. 

After the diffolution of the priory this church was granted by king Ed. 6. 
to Sir Thomas Dacre ; and after feveral mefne conveyances, is now the pro- 
perty of Mr. Henry Smith the impropriator, who nominates the curate, and 
pays him 4/ yearly, which with a lot of 200/ from queen Anne's bounty and 
the furplice fees, is the whole endowment, and doth not exceed 10 1 per annum. 
For wherever any of thefe religious houfes became established, they fwallowed 
up the revenues of almoft all the churches about them : Which revenues, at 
the diffolution, were not reftored to the churches, but given away to the king's 
favourites, or fold to fupply his neceffities. 

The families in this parifh are about 60 in number ; four of which 
are prefbyterian. 

PARISH OF DENTON. 

Denton lies in the utmoft north-eaft limits of Gilfland ; and is divided 
into Nether-Denton and Over-Denton. They are ftrictly two parifhes, but we 
will firft treat of them jointly. The word Denton fignifies a town in a deep 
valley. The Irifh call deep in their language dain, which hath fome affinity 
with the Saxon word den. Over-Denton Stands beyond the great bottom or 
valley, and Nether-Denton in the low grounds. Hubert de Vallibus, lord of 
Gilfland, gave Denton to one IFe/kopp, and he to Giljbueth (or Bueth fon of 
Gilfrid) ? which Giljbueth had iSTue Robert fon of Bueth, who died without iffue, 
and Gil/bueth's two daughters were his heirs â€¢, one married to Addock lord of 
Bothcaltre, the other to Euftachius de Vallibus lord of Hayton. The former 
had Over-Denton, and the latter Nether-Denton, which became two moieties 
then by partition. . 

Over-Denton, in the 7 Ed. 1. was in the pofTeflion of Richard Stcnland, 
who in that year (together with Elena his wife) granted the fame to John Wu 
therington, in whole family it long continued. From them it came to the 
T'poeedaks, and So to the earls of Carlisle. The lands are cuStomary, and pay 
an arbitrary fine on the change of tenant by death or alienation, and a twenty- 
penny fine on change of lord by death : Alfo an heriot at the death of the

tenant; 



ESKDALE WARD. (Denton.) 5 c 9 

tenant; and if there be no live cattle, then 4.0s in lieu thereof. They like- 
wife pay one (hilling each yearly in lieu of fervices. 

This Over- Denton, though in the county of Cumberland, is deemed to be 
in the diocefe of Durham, and was given by Robert de Vallibus and Robert 
fon of Anketil to the priory of Lanercoft, and appropriated to that houfe by 
Hugh bifhop of Durham (who prefided in that fee at the foundation of the 
faid priory and 28 years after) ; as appears by the following inftrument in the 
Lanercoft Regifier : " PL Dei gratia Dunelmenfis epifcopus, omnibus clericis 
ae totius epifcopatus fui, falutem. Sciatis nos dediffe, conceftlffe, et confirmafTe 
" priori et canonicis de Lanercoft, ad prasfentationem Roberti de Vallibus et 
" Roberti fiiii Anketilli, ecclefiam de Veteri Denton tenendam. Ita quod 
" ipfi canonici praslentabunt nobis et fuccefforibus noftris, quoties ipfa ecclefia

*' rario, Magiftro Ricardo de Coldingham, Willielmo filio archiepifcopi et 
Â« aliis." 

This parifh hath been fo totally ruinated, that there are now only about 
fifteen families â€¢, the curate is named by the earl of Carlifle, who is impropri- 
ator, and receives all kinds of tithes great and fmall, and allows the curate 20s 
yearly. 

Nether-Denton, as is aforefaid, came by marriage to Euftachius de Val- 
libus lord cf Hay ton. It was afterwards granted to John de DentonSdn of Ro- 
bert fon of Ankitill ; vih\c\\ John had a fon John, who had a fon Richard Den- 
ton knight, whofe daughter and heir Margaret was married in the 17 Ed. 2. to 
Adam Copele of Bateley in the county of York. John, fon of the laid Adam y 
had iffue Richard Ccpeley, whofe daughter and heir Jfabcl was married to Adam 
Denton fon of Thomas del Hall in Henry the fourth's time â€¢, which Adam Denton 
had a fon Thomas, who had a fon Richard, whofe fon John Denton exchanged 
this purparty of Denton in Henry the feventh's time with the lord Dacre for 
Warnell, and was anceftor of the prefent family of the Dentons of IVarnelL 
And from that time it defcended in the pofterity of the Dacres, and is now the 
inheritance of Frederick earl of Carlifle. 

The church of Nether Denton is dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and is rectorial. 

The aforefaid Robert fon of Bueth gave it to the monks of Wetheral. He 
alfo by the advice and confent of his wife and friends gave to the church fome 
of his lands that lay near to it, and eight acres befides as well without as within 
the village : Which grant was confirmed by John and Eiias fons of David de 
Denton, and appropriated to the finding a light or candle before the altar of 
the holy trinity in the church of Wetheral. 

After 



SI <5 ESKDALEWARD. (Denton.) 

After his death, one David fon of Terry and Robert fon of Ankitill gave this 
fame church to the priory of Lanercoit; whereupon did arife great fuit, till 
the controverfy was ended by mediation of the pope's legate, who divided the 
profits between them, and gave the prefentation and advowfon of the rectory 
to the bifhop. 

The fhare which each of the faid houfes had out of this rectory was two 
marks and an half. And in the year 1266 the prior and monks of Wetheral 
releafed their part to the bifhop and his fucceflbrs ; of which an entry appears 
to be made in their Regifter. 

In 1304, Robert Oriel was collated by bifhop Halton to the rectory of Den- 
ton, with a faving to the bifhop and his fucceffors of the penfion of 33 j 4^, 
and the likefum to the prior and convent of Lanercoft. And again in 1306, 
on the collation of Sir A dam de Kale, there is a like refervation of five marks, 
viz. two and an half to the bifhop and his fucceffors, and two and an half to 
the prior and convent of Lanercoft. 

In 1309, at an ordination held in the parifh church of Stanwix, John de 
Culgayth rector of Denton was ordained prieft. After him Sir John de Abering- 
ton was collated in 1317. â€” Sir Richard de Brotlon in 1385. 

After the reformation, Sir Edward Bell the rector died in 1567, and was 
fucceeded (on the collation of bifhop Beft) by Sir Chrifiopher Lowtber clerk ; 
on whofe refignarion in 1576, Sir Miles Matmaugh was collated by bifhop 
Barnes. â€” Next, Sir William Thompfon clerk was collated in 1586. â€” Sir Roland 
Baxter in 1597. â€” After him, Sir Ralph Snowden ; on whofe death in 1633, 
Nicholas Dean, B. A. was collated. 

In 1692, William Culcheth was rector, and refigned. After him, Richard 
Culcheth -, on whofe ceflion in 1703, Thomas Pearfon, B. A. was collated by 
bifhop Nicolfon. 

In 171 8, on Thomas Pearfon's death, Nicholas Reay was collated by bifhop 
Bradford. 

In 1736, Nicholas Reay dying, William Hejket was collated by bifhop 
Fleming. 

This church is rated in the king's books at 8/ 5* Â§d. It was returned to 
the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 16/ is6d. In 1761, it had an 
augmentation of 400/ (200/ whereof was given by the countefs dowager 
Gower). And having 40 acres of glebe land or upwards, it may now be 
worth between 50/ and 6olper annum. 

In this parifh are about 50 families; two whereof are prefbyterians. 

PARISH OF CUMREW. 

Cumrew is a fmall parifh, bounded by the parifhes of Croglin, Cumwhit- 
ton, Carlatton, and Caftlecarrock. 

The manor belongs to the earl of Carlifle-, who has about 26 tenants, who 
pay a free rent of ilgs 3d, indenture rent 2/ 3s lid, and cuftomary rent 

6/ 



ESKDALE WARD. (Cumrew.) 5 ti 

6/ 10 s yid. The cuftomary tenants pay a twenty-penny fine upon change of 
the lord by death, and an arbitrary fine upon change of tenant by death or 
alienation. The tenants alfo pay each is yearly to the lord for fervice money. 

The church here being wholly appropriated to the dean and chapter of Car- 
lifie, they nominate a curate, who is licenfed by the bifhop. He has a leafe 
from the dean and chapter of " All thofe the houfes and glebe lands, tithes, 
" fruits, oblations, obventions, profits, and commodities, whatfoever, belong- 
" ing or appertaining to the chapel of Cumrew," under the yearly rent of ten 
tficeps of haver meal, and one pound in money free of all taxes. The leflee 
to repair the chancel, houfes, and buildings. 

In lieu of tithe corn, the parifhioners pay 119 bufhels of meal ; and inftead 
of tithe hay, a prefcription of 1/ $s 2d. It was certified to the governors of 
queen Anne's bounty at 13/ 12 s iod; and hath fince received an allotment of 
200/ from the faid governors, wherewith lands were purchafed in the parifh 
of Ainftable, of the prefent yearly value of yl. 

In this parifn are about 41 families ; all of the church of England. 

About a quarter of a mile fouth-eaft from the church, are the ruins of a 
large caftle or building, fituate on a rifing ground, very near the bottom of 
Cumrew fell. This feems to be Dunwalkght caftle mentioned in Dugdale's 
Baronage, vol. 2. p. 22. as fituate on the marches towards Scotland, and be- 
longing to the Dacres. For there are two little manors here, Brackenthwaite 
and Newbiggin, which did belong to that family, till the earl of SufTex's heirs 
fold them to Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave baronet, and he to the earl of Carlifle, 
grandfather of the prefent earl. 

PARISH OF CASTLE CARROCK. 

Castle Carrock (Caftle Crag, or rock) is a fmall parifh within the ba- 
rony of Gilfland, at the foot of the great mountain Crofs-fell, and confifts 
only of one conflablewick. Hubert de Vallibus, lord of Gilfland, gave this 
manor, and alfo Hayton, to one Eufiace de Vallibus. Which Euftace gave a 
carucate of land at Caftle Carrock, and another at Hayton, to the priory of 
Lanercoft. 

In Henry the fecond's time, it was the inheritance of Robert de Caftle Carrock^ 
and after him fuccefTively it defcended to Robert his fon, and to Richard his grand- 
fon, whofe fon Robert de Caftle Carrock was the lall of that name inheritor thereof. 
He died in Edward the firft's time, and left three daughters coheirs, which he 
had by his wife Chriftian de Crokedake aunt and one of the two coheirs of John 
ion of John fon of Adam de Crokedake. The faid three daughters were 
Johan wife of Thomas Newbiggin, Chriftian wife of Michael Appleby, and 
'Margery wife of William Eglesfield. 

Ncwbiggin's part, which was that of Johan the eldeft filler, defcended to 
three daughters and heirs, Hellen married to Richard Hale, Margaret married 

to

to Thomas Hale, and Alice married to John Hale, all of the parifh of Kirkby 
Thore. Hellen's part came to William Kitchen, who fold the fame to Ranulph de 
Dacre, that married the heirefs of Gilfland. Margaret's part came by a 
daughter named Alice, the wife of Collinfon, to two daughters Johan married 
to Gilbert Carleton, and Margaret married to John Betham of Thrimby, and 
in the fourth defcent Elizabeth Betham, then heir, wife of Robert Salkeld, 
had iffue Roger Salkeld, who fold it to 'Lough. 

The purparty of Chrijlian de Caftle Carrock wife of Appleby, went by her 
daughter named Chriftian to William Ritfbn, and by their daughter Mariot to 
Thomas Alanby, and by their daughter to John de Weft Levington, and by

defcent fold it to Dacre. 

What became immediately of the third purparty of Margery de Caftle Car- 
rock, wife of Eglesfield, we have not found. But in the 12 Cha. 2. Sir John 
Ballentine knight and Anne his wife conveyed the manor of Caftle Carrock to 
Charles earl of Carlifie grandfather of Frederic earl of Carlifle the prefent 
owner. 

There are about 12 tenants in this manor, who pay a yearly cuftomary rent 
of 2/ 12 s 6d to Armathwaite caftle, and arbitrary fines. 

The church cf Caftle Carrock is rectorial, and in the patronage of the dean 
and chapter of Carlifle, unto whom it pays an annual penfion of 2 s. It is va- 
lued in the king's books at $1 12s ud, was certified to the governors of 
queen Anne's bounty at 42/. and is not yet worth much more than go I per 
annum. 

In the year 13 12, Robert de Helpeft on was inftituted to the rectory on the 
presentation of the prior and convent of Carlifle, faving to the faid prior and 
convent a yearly penfion of 2 s due and of old time accuftomed. 

In 1346, John de Beghokirk was prefented by the prior and convent to the 
vacant rectory. 

In 1356, Six Adam rector of Caftlekayroke is cited to fhew caufe why (be- 
ing feized with a leprofy to fuch a degree that his parifhioners dare not refort 
to divine fervice) he ought not to have a coadjutor affigned him. 

In 1380, Thomas de Carleton, rector of Caftclkayroke, makes his laft will, 
and bequeathes feveral remarkable legacies in twinter fheep Cbidentes), lambs, 
ftones of wool, bows and arrows, and (amongft the reft) to the vicar of Eden- 
hall his book called Placebo Dirige. And foon after, John Colt was inftituted 
by William rector of Bownefs the bifhop's vicar general. 

In 1571, John Richardfon clerk, on the death of John Richard/on fenior, 
had inflitution on the prefentation of William Vale of the city of Carlifle, who 
(with others) had procured a grant of this avoidance from Lancelot Salkeld 
(the firft) dean and chapter of Carlifle. 

In 1586, John Stodart was prefented by the faid dean and chapter. In 
1589, Leonard Milium. In 1635, Chriftopher Gibfon. In 1672, Henry Skar- 
rovj. In 1679, Chriftopher Rickcrby. In 1722, Jofeph Pattinfon.

In 1739, upon the death of Jofeph Pat tin fon, John Pear/on clerk was infti- 
tuted to the re&ory, on the presentation of the faid dean and chapter. 

In this parifh are about 42 families, fix whereof are prefbyterian. 

PARISH OF CARLATTON. 

THE parifh of Carlatton (or, Carkton) is furrounded by thofe of 
Caftlecarrock, Combwhitton, and Hayton. It contains within it 1550 acres 
of arable land, but hath few inhabitants, and hath had no parifh church for 
feveral ages, and it is only known by tradition where the church flood. 

In Henry the fecond's time one Gofpatric fon of Macbenck held it of the 
king, and paid 50 marks. This Macbenck (Mac-ben-og) was an Irifhman and 
took part with king Stephen, therefore his fon Gofpatric compounded with 
king Henry for his father's life. After him, king John gave it to Robert de 
Rofs of Werk in Tindale, and alfo Sowerby and Hubert by, until the faid 
Robert de Rofs {hould recover his lands in Normandy, which he loft in the 
king's fervice. Henry the third took them from him, and gave them to 
Alexander king of Scots and his fucceffors who held the fame until king Edward 
the firft feized them for the revolt of John Baliol king of Scots, and granted 
the fame to Anthony Beck the military bifhop of Durham who had afiifted king 
Edward greatly in his wars in Scotland, but the parliament fome years after 
obliged the king to refume that grant. Since which time Carlatton continued 
royal demefne, until king Richard the fecond's time, who granted the fame to 
Ralph Nevil earl of Weftmorland and Johan his wife. After him it defcended 
to Richard his fon earl of Salijbury, and from him to Richard earl of Warwick 
his fon, who was flain at the battle of Barnet. After whofe death, king Ed- 
ward the fourth gave it to his brother Richard duke of Gloucejier, afterwards 
king. Henry the feventh, upon his obtaining the crown, granted it to fome 
of his friends who had been fufferers in the Lancaftrian caufe. And it ftili 
remains as crown land, and is held upon leafe, together with Gelfton foreft: 
adjoining, by the earl of Carlifle. 

The church of Carlatton was given by Robert de Vallibus to the priory of 
Lanercoft, and by bifhop Halton (with the confent of king Edward the firft) 
totally appropriated to that houfe. The reafons given for the appropriation 
were, that the Scots had deftroyed the monaftery by fire and fword, and that 
the king's army for fome time had lived upon free quarter amongft the tenants 
of the priory, to their great damage and impoverifhment; and it was upon 
condition, that the prior and convent mould endow the vicarage in an honour- 
able manner, and have a vicar coaftantly refident upon the place. 

Robert de London was rector when this appropriation was made, and it was 
not to take place till after his death. He was prefented by the aforefaid An- 
thony Beck bifhop of Durham ; upon which prefentation, the bifhop awarded 
(as was ufual) ajus patronatus, and the inquifition finds that Alexander king of

Scotland prefented lad, that the bifhop of Durham is owner of the village of 
Carleton, but whether he is owner of the church the jurors know not. 

After the refumption of the grant to the bifhop, the advowfon was granted 
by the faid king Edward the firft to the prior and convent. 

In the year 1320, Henry de Newton was prefented by the faid prior and con- 
vent to the vicarage of Carleton, and thereupon inftituted. 

In 1344, Sir William de Stockdale was inftituted on the like prefentation. 

In 1380, Sir Richard Hogge was in like manner prefented by the prior and 
convent, and inftituted thereupon. â€” And this is the laft account that we meet 
with thereof in the bifhops regifters. After the diflblution of the priory, the 
whole revenues of this church came to the crown, and in confequence thereof 
all the tithes great and fmall are now in the leflee. 

PARISH OF HAYTON. 

THE parifh of Hayton is circumfcribed by the parifhes of Cumwhitton, 
Wetheral, Warwick, Irthington, Brampton, Farlam, and Caftle Carrok; and 
includes in it the two manors of Hayton and Talkin, both within the barony and 
belonging to the lords of Gilfland. 

Hayton confifts of about 93 cuftomary tenements, which pay yearly 18/ 
12 s id ancient rent; every ancient tenement pays alfo 1 s in lieu of fervices. 
They pay alfo 23/ yearly free rent, for their commons divided in 1704. 

The manor of Talkin confifts of about 20 tenements; the yearly cuftomary 
rent 61 9 s od. And every tenement pays 2 d for greenhue, and 1 s yearly in 
lieu of fervices. 

The tenants of both the faid manors pay fines upon death and alienation ac- 
cording to the general cuftom of the barony of Gilfland. 

The church of Hayton was given by Robert de Vallibus to the prior and. 
convent of Carlifle, and foon after appropriated to that houfe. The dean and 
chapter are the prefent impropriators and patrons, and leafe out the tithes for 
21 years, referving the yearly payment of 17 efkeps of good haver meal, and 
the leflee covenants to pay the curate and all dues and duties ordinary and ex- 
traordinary, and to repair the chancel. They alfo grant to the fame leflee all 
the tithe of corn, grain, and hay of the new improvements, for the like term,, 
and under the yearly rent of 10s. 

The curate is endowed with fevcral parcels of land, and a ftipend of 5 / from 
the dean and chapter's leflee; and in the year 1751 this church received an 
augmentation of 200/ by lot from the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 
and again in 1757 ; which being laid out in lands, the whole revenue amounts 
to upwards of 30/ a year. 

The families in this parifh are about 150 s whereof 3 are papifts, 2 prefby- 
terians, and 1 quaker.

Account of the different Valors of the diocefe of Carlisle; 
with a preface by bifhop Lyttelton. 

THE following account contains three ecclefiaftical Valors of Carlifle dio- 
cefe, ranged in three columns, for the eafier comparing them with each other. 
The firft, marked N. P. was made by order of pope Nicholas, A. D. 1291 
and 92, and taken from a Cotton MS. in the Britifh Mufseum (Tiberius C. X.) 
intitled, Regiftrum Dni Pape de Taxatione Spiritualita? et Temporalita? Anglie 
et Wallie y collated with a very fair copy in Litchfield Cathedral library, and 
alfo with the original regifter of John de Kirkby bifhop of Carlifle, where 
(inter folia 452 & 458) the taxation and value of every church, &c. is ac- 
curately entered. By this it appears, that the taxation of the Spiritualia was 
made by Richard de Whitby archdeacon of Carlifle, and Adam de Levyngton 
rector of Skelton, fecundum verum valorem prout folet communiter provenire, dated 
A. D. 1291, 19th of Ed. 1. And that of the Temporalia by Peter de Infula 
archdeacon of Exeter, and Adam de Afton rector of Beckenham, agents for 
this bufinefs under John biliop of Winton, and Oliver bifhop of Lincoln, 
appointed by the pope collectors of a fubfidy in fubfidium terre fantte, dated 
A. D. 1292. 

The fecond, marked Ed. 2. was a re-taxation under a new valuation, the 
former being fo enormoufly high, that the clergy here were unable to pay ir. 
It was made A. D. 13 18, 11 Ed. 2. in confequence of a royal mandate directed 
to the bifhop of Carlifle; which, as it occurs no where but in one of the re- 
gifters of that fee (from whence alfo this valor was extracted), and is the more 
curious, as I do not find the like indulgence was extended to any other diocefe, 
except that part of the preient diocefe of Chefter which lies in the archdeaconry 
of Richmond, I fhall here give it at large : ." Edw dus Dei gratia, Rex Anglie, 
&c. Venerab' in Chrifto J. eadem gratia Karl' Epo, falutem- Quia plurima

The third, marked H. 8. was made about the year 1546, 27 Hen. 8. and is 
here given from the original rotuli (commonly called the king's books) now re- 
maining in the firft fruits office in London ; by which the clergy pay their firft 
fruits and tenths at this day. 

On comparing thefe together, it appears, that the livings in general are 
rated confiderably higher in Edward the firft' s time than in Hen. 8th's. Which 
is the more remarkable, as within that period trade and manufactures were 
improved and had brought an increafe of fpecie into the kingdom, and con- 
fequently leflfened the value of money. Agriculture alfo was improved -, and 
in thefe parts, by the difaffbreftation of Englewood and other forefts, many 
wafte lands were converted, into good pafture and arable, which mult naturally 
increafe tne tithes in many parts of the diocefe. The temporalia of the bi- 
fhoprick, and of the feveral religious houfes, particularly of CarliQe priory 
and Holm Cultram are tared vaftly higher in Hen. 8th's valor than that of Ed- 
ward the firft, otherwife the fum total of Edward the firft's valor would have 
exceeded that of Hen. 8. 

With regard to the valor made in Ed. 2d's time, it falls fo vaftly fhort of 
the former, that one cannot but fufpect that the bifhop rated the feveral pre- 
ferments confiderably lower than the true value. The Scots indeed, about 
that time, had made fad devaftation in this country â€¢, and confequently the 
churches, liruated on the borders, muff, have fuffered greatly. But it can 
hardly be fuppofed, that every part of the diocefe was fo overrun and de- 
ftroyed, as to reduce the whole in value from 5171 / to 4.80 1 per Ann. The 
pope's collectors feem to have been of this opinion, and not to have much re- 
garded this latter valuation, till by a fpecial command of Ed. 3. in the 4th 
year of his reign, they were required to make it their rule, as well in that 
moiety which was then gathering for his holinefs, as in the other for the king's 
life. But this command was temporary only, and to continue no longer in 
force than till the meeting of the approaching parliament. What was then 
done n this affair doth not appear. But it feems, that about 30 years after- 
wards, the old taxation was again the ftandard, for in bifhop Appleby's regifter 
we have the taxationes epifcopatum Anglie^ and there Karliol' is rated at 3-171/ 5.*
