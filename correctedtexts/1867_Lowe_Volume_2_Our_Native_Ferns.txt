OUR NATIVE FERNS.
GENUS vr.
ATHYRIUM.
RoTu.
The present genus of Roth, holding a midway position 
between Asjrulitim and Asplenium, is rejected as a genus by 
some of our greatest authorities, being united to Asplenium.
Sir W.
Hooker places it in Asplenium as a sub-genus, dividing 
Asplenitan into the groups Tham?wpteris, jEuasplem'uni, Athy- 
rium, Eudiplaziimi, Anisogonium, and KcmidicUjwn.
Seven 
species are placed under Thamnopteris, and commonly called 
Bird-nest Ferns, none of which are found in Europe.
They 
are distinguished by a marginal longitudinal vein, with which 
the apices of the transverse veins unite, and there only.
Fronds 
simple; sori like Euasplenium.
Two hundred and seven species 
belong to Euasplenium, and are distinguished by the sori being 
plane or nearly so, nearly always single; veins free, simple, or 
branched, and the fronds undivided, lobed, or ]>almated, pinnate 
or bipinnate.
In this large branch are to be found Asplenium 
Hemionitis of Southern Europe, A.
attenuatum of New Holland, 
A. marinum of Great Britain, A.
lucichim of New Zealand, A.
angtistifoKum of the United States, A.
compressum of St. Helena, 
A. trichomanes of Great Britain, A.
Petrarchce of Southern 
France, A.
cbeneum of North America, A.
monanthemum of 
Madeira, A.
viride of England, A.
septentrionale of Great 
Britain, A.
Germanicum of Great Britain, A.
ruta-muraria of 
Great Britain, A.
Jissum of Southern Europe;, A.
adiantum- 
iiigrum of England, A.
lanceolatum of England, and A.
fontanum 
of England.

2 ATHYRIUM.
Twenty-nine species belong to Athyrium, which are distin- 
guished by short sori, and lax, convex, or arcuate involucres, 
and with pinnato-pinnatifid or bi-tripinnate fronds.
Amongst 
these are Asplenium filix-fwmina of Great Britain, A.
crenatum 
of ISTorway, and A.
tlielypter aides of North America.
Fifty-one species belong to Eadiplazium, having double 
involucres; none of which are European.
Seven species belong 
to Amsogotiium, having anastomosing veins; none of which are 
European.
Four species belong to Hemidictyum, having sori 
very long, naked, asplenoid, with veins anastomosing towards 
the margin.
In this group Sir W.
Hooker places Asplenium 
ceterach of England, (the Ceterach ojficinaruni of Willdenow, 
or Grammitis ceterach of Swartz.) 
Although I quite agree with Sir W.
Hooker in the dubious 
distinctness of the genus Athyrium from Asplenitan, still as 
Mr. Moore retains the genus we shall keep the Lady Fern 
distinct from the other Asjileniums.
Athyrium has short, oblong-lunate, curved, or horse-shoe- 
shaped indusiate sori; veins simple or forked from a central 
costa: venules free.
Caudex brief, erect, or creeping.
Fronds 
herbaceous, bi-tripinnate.
Only one species inhabits Great Britain.

Athyrium â€” From the Greek, athyros â€” opened.
Filix-fcemina â€” Lady Fern.
Caudex thick, occasionally with a trunk-like scaly crown.
Scales nearly black in colour, and more or less lanceolate in 
form.
Venation circinate, the apex at one period of its development 
curved downwards similar to a shepherd's crook.
Stipes from a third to a fourth of the length of the entire 
frond, terminal, stout, and thickened immediately above the base, 
green in some varieties, and pinky purple in others.
Thickly 
scaly at the base.
Rachis rounded behind and channeled in front, having a few 
narrow scales.
Fronds herbaceous, erect, spreading, or drooping, vivid green 
in colour, varying much in size and outline; length from twelve 
inches to forty inches, breadth from three inches to fourteen 
inches.
Lanceolate in form, bipinnate or sub-bipinnate.
Pinnte pinnate, numerous, broadest at the base, and gradually 
tapering to a point.
Pinnules various.
Veins forked or pinnately branched.
Fructification covering the whole under surface of the frond.
Sori numerous, short, medial, and indusiate.
Indusiuni membranaceous and variable in outline, taking the 
forms of the sori.
The fronds spring up in May, and decay in early autumn.
ATHYRIUM FILIX-FIKMINA.
Athyruan jilix-fcemina is a common species thronghout Great 
Britain, growing most luxuriantly in damp, shady situations.
In mountainous exposed situations it becomes dwarf and more 
rigid.
Scott remarked this when he wrote: â€” 
"Where the copse-wood is the greenest, 
"Where the fountain is the shcenost, 
Where the morning dew hes longest, 
There the Lady Fern grows strongest." 
The Lady Fern is to be found at every elevation up to 
three thousand feet.
The localities are too numerous to mention.
Abroad it is a native of Lapland, Russia, Holland, France, 
Scandinavia, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, 
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Transylvania, Greece, Crete, Caucasus 
and Ural Mountains, Russian Asia, Siberia, India, Mediterranean 
Islands, Algeria, Islands of Canary, Madeira, and TenerifFe, 
throughout North America, Canada, British Columbia, United 
States, Vera Cruz, Caraccas, Bolivia, and Cuba.
This species is readily cultivated both in the out-door Fernery 
and in pots, and is one of the finest of Ferns, in fact the 
Queen of Ferns, some of its varieties being most beautiful.
There are many striking varieties, all of which are graceful, 
and worthy a place in every Fernery, these are: â€”

Fig. 277.â€” Portion of Frond.
OxYDENS, Moore.
(Fig. Til.) â€” A beautiful variety, remark- 
ably frondose, or leafy, and having a very spreading habit.
It is hardlv of the robust form.
Fronds twelve to eighteen 
inches long, narrow lanceolate, profusely fertile.
Pinnte short- 
ened, and towards the apex (owing to a crispy contraction of 
6 
ATHYRIUM FILIX-FQiMlNA.
the midrib, not common to all fronds) sometimes much crowded 
upon the rachis, indeed decidedly imbricate.
The pinnules 
are thickly set upon the secondary rachides, and are both 
confluent and imbricate, but scarcely depauperate, although 
sometimes furcate.
The variety is scarcely bipinnate, but the 
pinnules are deeply incised, or erose, giving to the plant a 
distinctly toothed character, which, doubtless, suggested Mr.
Moore's name.
This plant is very rare, and somewhat strange 
to say, although so decided a sport has not hitherto been 
found to reproduce itself (in the discoverer's fernery at least) 
from the spores.
The variety was found by Mrs. C.
Monkman, 
of Malton, in the summer of 1861, in crossing the mountains 
from E Her ay to the Troutbeck Valley, in the Windermere 
district, and it has rather improved than otherwise in culti- 
vation.
From the reason given above this variety has only 
been "multiplied by division," and plants are only held by 
Mr. Monkman, Mr. Clowes, Mr. Clapham, and Messrs.
Stansfield.
The illustration is from the original plant found by Mrs.
Monkman.

Latifolium, Bahimjton.
(Fig. 278.) â€” A very handsome 
vio'orous-growing variety, found near Keswick, Cumberland, by 
Miss Wright.
Although only one or two plants were discovered, 
owing to its being reproduced by spores, it has now become 
widely spread in our Ferneries.
A peculiar-looking variety, 
it is remarkable for the irregular outline of the pinnae, for the 
peculiar position of the sori; and for the pinnules being densely 
crowded together, very various in size, and uneven in toothing.
Length of frond upwards of three feet; colour dark green.
Bipinnate, oblong-lanceolate, and flaccid.
Eachis and stipes 
strong and thick, and of about the usual length.
Finnai brief.
ATIIYRIUM FILIX-Pa^MINA, i 
wide apart below, and crowded together towards the apex of 
the frond.
Alternate and linear oblong.
Pinnnles usually 
oblong-ovate, overlapping, flat, oblique, the anterior side the 
longest.
The peculiar toothed margin gives the frond a fim- 
briated appearance.
Sori situated on the anterior side of the 
basal anterior venule; however the vein becoming branched at 
a greater distance from a midvcin than is ordinarily the case, 
the sori become placed half-way between the margin and the 
midvein in two distinct lines.
Sori small and curved.
My 
thanks are due to Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart., of Kolleston 
Hall; Mr. E.
Cooling, of Derby; and to Mr. R.
Sim, of Foot's 
Cray, for plants.

CoxioiDES, Ap2)lehy.
(Fig. 279.) â€” Found at Cantley, near 
Doncaster, by Mr. S.
Appleby.
Length of frond two feet.
Stipites pale in colour, and furnished with light brown scales.
Fronds broadly lanceolate.
It takes its name from a resemblance 
to the hemlock leaves in the outline and divisions of the fronds.
Pinnee irregular in outline, somewhat distant and acuminate.
Pinnules mostly ovate, occasionally oblong, decurrent at the 
base, varying in size and outline, distant.
Lobes distant and 
shallow, and notched almost to the apex, and these again 
notched with brief minute teeth.
In the fertile fronds the 
pinnules taper to an acute point, and the lobes are narrower 
and more distant.
Sori situated near the base of the lobes.
It is not uncommon to observe forked or ramose pinnules.
My thanks are due to Mr. Swynfen Jcrvis, of Darleston Hall;

Ramo-diffissitm, Monhman.
(Fig. 280.) â€” Fronds usually 
ramose or trifid, lanceolate.
Pinna as in dijfisum, tlie lower 
pair, or one of them, frequently forming a diminutive frond.
Sometimes the fronds are of the normal outline, except that 
the lower pair of pinna?, by forming dwarf frond-like elonga- 
tions, give them a sagittate feature.
Of a spreading habit, 
with all the delicacy of diffisum or dissectum, and the pecu- 
liarly wide and irregular toothing of those vai'ieties.
The plant 
is very beautiful, and was raised in the fernery of Mr. C.
Monlcman, of Malton, who sends the fronds.
Mr. Monkman 
has sown spores more than once, but has never succeeded in 
raising a ramose seedling, the young plants having all reverted 
to diffisum or dissectum, although the plant is very constant 
to the ramose character, a frond of purely normal outline 
being the exception.
The illustration is from Mr. Monkman's 
plant.
Alatum, Moore.
â€” This variety was first found on Loch-na-gar 
about seven years ago, growing amongst Polypodium alpestrc.
The plant is in the possession of Mr. A.
Tait, of Edinburgh.

rounded apex; pinnatifid almost to the rachis at the base, 
above which more confluent, the pinnules being connected with 
the rachis by a broad distinct wing.
Pinnules overlapping; as 
broad above as below, their apices rounded, and the margins

Semidepauperatum, Clapham.
(Fig. 281.) â€” An erect-growing

forming a fine convolvulus-shaped plant.
Fronds of the outline 
of marinum, the fronds and pinnce making very long attenuated 
apices, all of which, together with the pinnules, are semide- 
pauperated, or deeply cleft into somewhat regular sinuses, 
giving to the plant a very elegant, in addition to its extremely 
graceful, appearance.
It is truthfully constant, and profusely 
fertile.
Probably one of the prettiest of the long-striped 
nonfrondose varieties.

MoNKMANii, 3Ioore.
(Figs.
282 and 283.) â€” A crested form of 
irregular habit.
The fronds are normal in outline, having the 
pinnse rather distant, and the pinnules broad, incised, and much 
crowded, sub-imbricate.
The fronds are all crested, but not 
with any degree of regularity, some being massive, as in coronatis, 
others as in multljidum, with an occasional multi-furcate apex.
The pinuEE are generally crested, but vary in size and regularity.
The plant is very handsome, erect in habit, and peculiarly 
frondose in the pinnte.
This variety was found by ]Mr. Monk- 
man, in 1860, growing on a bank near a well in Troutbeck 
ATHYRIUM riLIX-FCEMINA, 
11 
village, where hundreds of persons must have passed it daily, 
at least in the summer-time, in going to or returning from 
Ambleside.
The plant, when found by Mr. Monkman, was 
double crowned, and was divided with ]Mr. Clowes, the variety 
yet remaining exclusively in possession of these growers.
Mr.
Monkman sends the frond for illustration.

Sori irregular.
Found by Mr. A.
Tait, of Edinburgh, in 1853, 
in the seam of a perpendicular rock on the pine-covered 
mountains near Dunkcld.
For plants and fronds I am indebted

SuBDEPAUPERATUM, Clowes.
(Fig. 285.) â€” A large-growing 
variety, apparently of the decompositum type, found by Mr.
F. Clowes, at Windermere.
Its peculiarity consists in the 
pinnte being occasionally denuded of their pinnules, of which 
only the midribs perhaps are represented; and in some cases 
12 
ATHYRIUM FILIX-FCEMINA.
the pinnae tliemselves are either totally wanting, or have merely 
their midribs present.
The variety grows well in Mr. Clowes' 
out-door Fernery at Windermere, and is quite constant to its 
odd-looking peculiarities.
The illustration is from a division 
of the original plant, forwarded by Mr. C.
Monkman.
The 
variety is more curious than pretty.

Acuminatum, Moore.
(Fig. 286.) â€” Found some years ago 
on Snowdon by Mr. W.
Pamplin.
This interesting and singular 
variety is of dwarf habit.
The fronds, which are broadly 
lanceolate, are somewhat more than twelve inches in length.
The pinnae are crowded, brief, deflexed below, the longest 
pinnae terminating in a serrated acuminate point.
The pinnules 
distinct, but decurrent, linear-oblong in form, blunt at the 
apex, and frequently narrowed below, numerous, patent, {%.

spreading at an angle of 45Â°,) pinnatifid in the basal part.
The 
dentation of the pinnules and lobes also long and acute.
Sori 
in lines near the costa, and abundant.
The chief peculiarity 
of this slender and graceful variety consists in its acuminated 
pinnae, and narrow oblong pinnules.
PoLYCLADOS-iRREGULARE, Moore.
â€” Found by Mr. G.
B. Wol- 
laston, of Chlselhurst, in Pett's Wood, near Chiselhurst, Kent, 
and at Hulm, near Windermere.
Fronds frequently branched, 
and multifid at the apex; the apices also of the irregular 
confused-looking pinnae frequently forked.
Pinnules irregular 
both in size and form, sometimes ovate and profoundly pinna- 
tifid, occasionally linear, with narrow lobes, or distorted, or 
abbreviated.
Dentation not prominent, brief, and acute.

nature of the ramose pinnse the imbricate character is strongly- 
marked throughout.
The apices of the frond are more or less 
flattish-forked or branched, but where not so are attenuated 
or caudate, much resembling in the upper parts the variety 
Fieldice.
The plant is profusely fertile, and is a vigorous grower.
The history of this remarkable variety is obscure.
The plant 
illustrated was purchased at the Yorkshire Gala, 1863, for Mr, 
C. Monkman, of Malton.
The exhibitor knew little of it, except 
that it had been found by a Mr. R-utson, somewhere about the 
Hambleton range of hills, in North Yorkshire.

Plumosum-Monkmanii, Stansjield.
(Fig. 289.) â€” This elegant 
variety was found by Mr. C.
Monkman, when botanizing in 
company with Mr. T.
Stansfield, in Coneysthorpe banks, Castle 
Howard, Yorkshire, in 1862.
Four crowns were found, which 
are held by the discoverer, Messrs.
Stansfield, the Yorkshire 
Philosophical Society, and Mr. Clapham.
The form is recog- 
nisable as a plumose variety at first glance, but on examination 
does not prove so finely divided as the plumosum of the Messrs.
Stansfield, from which also it differs in its erect, stiff" habit of 
growth, and rigid pinnse.
The Messrs.
Stansfield's form of 
plumosum is certainly the more graceful of the two.
So far 
Mr. Monkman's variety has proved barren.
The illustration is 
from one of the original plants, sent by Mr. Monkman.
Cristatum, Monkman.
â€” This form is distinguished by its 
crested apices of fronds, the pinnse shewing no such peculiarity.
It was found by Mr. C.

The 
difference consists in its erect habit of growth, and generally 
robust character.
The fronds are short, and the apices of the 
fronds and pinn?e all end in a massive crown-like crest, rendering 
the plant very distinct botanically, and in appearance from 
multijidum.
The illustration is from Mr. Monkman's plant,

(Fig. 291.) â€” A curious variety.
Large 
spreading fronds, usually twin- or ramo-fronded, or furcate; the 
primary divisions more or less irregularly forked, but without 
any tendency to cresting.
Some fronds are not ramose, but 
have a peculiar warty contraction of the midrib about mid- 
frond, which causes the pinnae to crowd into masses on either 
side.
The plant is a curiosity, with no two fronds exactly 
alike, and many as divergent as possible.

combe, Devonshire, by the Rev. J.
M. Chanter; in Guernsey by 
Mr. C.

and pinnae are bifid or trifid, rarely approaching a crest.
Mr.
Monkman visited the station in Troutbcck, in 1863, and found 
two more plants.
An illustration is not needed.
MuLTiFiDUM, 3Ioore.
(Plate XXXVI.) â€” A most beautiful, 
symmetrical, and graceful Fern, although a monstrosity.
It 
was originally found in Ireland, near Seven Churches, County 
Wicklow, by Mr. D.
Moore, of the Glasnevin Gardens, Dublin; 
other very similar forms have since been found in County 
Clare by the late Dr. Kinahan; in Killarney by Mr. Ogilby; 
in the lake district of Westmoreland, now in the possession of 
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston; and in Scotland at the base of Ben 
Lawers by Mr. W.
Marshall, of York.
This variety is analogous 
to the cristate variety of Lastrea filix-mas.
The fronds are 
two to three feet in length, and nine or ten inches in width.
Normal in habit, broadly lanceolate, and somcAvhat lax.
The 
characteristic difference of this variety consists in the apices of 
the fronds, and also of the pinnro and pinnules being beauti- 
fully tasseled, or divided into dichotomously branched narrow 
segments.
In the many times dichotomously branched apices 
of the pinnules the tips of the segments are spread out and 
incised.
The pinnules are oblong-acute, subfalcate, pinnatifid, the 
points of the lobes recurving, as in the variety rhceticum, and 
thus in some degree detracting from the beauty of the fronds, 
giving them a curled appearance, although the beauty is not 
marred to any great extent.
JNIy thanks are due to Mr. Sim, 
of Foot's Cray; jMr. Monkman, of Malton; to Mr. Kennedy, 
of Covent Garden; to Mr. E.
Cooling, of Derby; and to Mr.
Veitch, of the Exotic Nurseries, Chelsea, for plants; and to 
the same gentlemen, and to Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst, 
for fronds.
MuLTiFiDUM-RAMOSUM, Moore.
â€” Eaiscd from spores by Mr.
Clapham, of Scarborough.
Fronds broad and short, they 
are more lax and slender than in the ordinary form of mul-

Pinnules 
also narrower, and somewhat depauperated, and their apices 
more raggedly multifid.
Mr. Moore remarks that the fronds

It differs in the great breadth of its pinnules, in the larger 
size of its tasseled apices, and by its red stipes and rachis.
Length of frond from eighteen inches to nearly three feet, and 
from six to ten inches broad.
Pinna3 approximate, oblong, but 
slightly tapering towards the apex, the rachis dividing into three 
branches about six or eight inches below the apex, each branch 
being bijnnnate, and tufted corymbosely.
Along the rachis of 
these branches the pinnules are uninterruptedly continued, and 
thus materially increasing the breadth of the tuft.
Pinnules 
broad, oblong, blunt, and somewhat connected, as in molle; 
they are set immediately on the rachides, giving the frond a 
peculiar breadth and fulness.
The corymbose termination is 
large and spreading, bearing pinnules throughout.
My thanks 
are due to Mr. James, of Vauvcrt, and to Mr. E.
Cooling, of 
Derby, for fronds.

CoRYMBiFERUM-LowEi, LoKc.
(Fig. 321.) â€” Raised from 
spores at Highfield House.
Length of frond twenty-two inches, 
width in centre eight inches.
This form differs in the fiat 
wide-spreading multifid apices of tlie pinna?, and in the flat 
many-branched compact ultimate crest.
It also differs in habit, 
the fronds rising from the crown at an angle of about 50Â°, 
the apices alone weeping.
Being a young plant, next season 
it is probable, that it may be e^â€¢en finei- than in 1864.

Dareoides, Moore, (originally named Davallioides by Mr.
G. B.
Wollaston.) (Fig. 322.) â€” Discovered in Ireland in the 
year 1854, near Castle Kelly, County Dublin, by my late 
mucb respected friend Dr. Kinalian; and subsequently a 
somewhat similar variety has been found near Todmorden by 
Mr. Stansfield.
A singular distinct Darea-\ook\ng variety, 
having the pinnules pinnatifid, the indentations entire at their 
edges, and having the sori situated in the angle, causing the 
spore-cases to project beyond the margin of the frond.
The 
pinnules also bulge forwards.
Mr. Stansfield's plant has fronds 
eighteen inches in length, and nine inches in breadth, ovate- 
lanceolate in form, with approximate pinnse and somewhat 
distant pinnules.
The pinnce overlap each other, and are 
broad linear-oblong, tapering to a long point.
Pinnules distinct, 
ovate-oblong in shape, jsrofoundly pinnatifid; lobes narrow, 
and only toothed at the end, and having very open sinuses.
Some lobes have merely a single vein, the sorus being situated 
on a short fork near the base, other lobes have two, three, 
or four branch veins.
Sori small, forming a single row on 
either side of and near to the costa, and just abutting on 
the sinus.

Fronds quite tripinnate.
The i)innules 
are divided to the midrib at the base, and the brief oblong 
blunt secondary pinnules are toothed along their sides, or 
even pinnatifid with dentate lobes.
Length of frond two feet, 
width eight inches.
Pinnic Avidest in tlie widest part of the 
frond, narrowing and shortening towards the base and apex.
This variety differs in the pinnatifid character of the secondary 
lobes from incisum.
It is therefore a more decompound form 
of incisum, and very graceful.
No illustration is necessary.

regards the fact that with Grantice the margins of the leaflets 
are undulated, so as to produce a prettily crimped appearance.

combe, by Mr. J.
Morse.
An exceedingly Iiandsome and distinct 
variety.
Length of frond eighteen inches, bipinnate, pinna?
distant.
The apex of the frond exjjands into a large multifid- 
crispy head, broader than the frond.
The chief characteristic 
is the large size of the multifid apex, which is three inches 
and a half in length and five inches in width, being composed 
of a dense mass of segments, forming a somewhat circular 
crispy bunch.
Another characteristic is the small inconspicuous 
tassels of the pinnte.
My thanks are due to Mr. Swynfen 
Jervis, of Darlaston Hall, and to Mr. Elworthy, of Nettle- 
combe, for fronds.

74 ATHYRIUM FILIX-r(EMINA.
AcROCLADON, Moove.
(Plate XXXVIII.) â€” This variety is 
worthy of the title of "Queen of Lady Ferns;" indeed its 
exquisite foliage is unequalled in the whole range of British 
botany, and, at the present time, it is at once the rarest and 
most remarkable of the British filices.
Hitherto barren, plants 
have only been obtained by division, a slow process, which in 
eight years has not yielded as many plants.
There is, there- 
fore, no immediate likelihood that this much-coveted prize will 
become generally distributed.
Indeed, so slowly has this 
charming Fern been increased, that the discoverer, Mr. C.
Monkman, of Malton, has had to exercise seven years' patience 
before obtaining a specimen for his own collection.
The 
original plant was found by Mr. Monkman growing by a 
road-side on the moor-track between Byland and Rivaulx 
Abbeys, in Yorkshire.
There were a few other Lady Ferns 
in company, all of which were quite normal; and, although 
various botanists have carefully searched the station many 
times, no second plant of acrocladon has been met Avith, nor 
has even a slight divergence from the normal form of Athy- 
rium been found.
The discoverer presented his plant to Mr.
A. Clapham, of Scarborough, in whose possession it has since 
remained.
In 1863 that gentleman could boast of a plant 
(the original one) fully two feet high, and as much in 
diameter, â€” a mass of the most exquisite foliage, to which 
no word-picture can ever do justice.
When found the young 
seedling bore a general resemblance to the variety crispum or 
Smithiiy but it was soon seen to be distinct, and with groAvth 
became entirely so.
The fronds upon Mr. Clapham's plant 
have been two feet long, having no definite form.
The rachis, 
stout at the base, divides near the crown, the divisions con- 
tinuing to fork many times without any regularity whatever, 
forming a densely ramified mass of foliage.
Although the 
variety crispujn gives a good idea of the young state of 
acrocladon, the latter, when mature, does not possess any 
resemblance to the former.
Acrocladon, indeed, is vigorous 
and erect in growth.
The apices of the frondial divisions, 
and those of the irregular pinnse, are all densely tasseled, or 
crested; and the pinnse and pinnules are unsymmetrically 
erosely toothed.
So far as Mr. Monkman has observed, the 
varietv is barren.
The illustration is from a frond contributed

much as five inches wide.
The pinnae have at their base 
inciso-serrate, unequal, oblong pinnules; the pinnules becoming 
shorter towards the apex, and ultimately expanding into large, 
lacerate, many-times-divided, terminal tassels, forming a uniform

(Fig. 384.)â€” Found in 1860 
near Levens by Mr. Barnes.
A slender narrow-fronded variety, 
thirteen inches in length, and two inches and a half to three 
inches wide.
A remarkable laciniated form.
The four basal 
pimije very small and brief, then very various in size, becoming 
irregularly small near the apex, distant and opposite below, 
and alternate and by no means approximate above.
Pinnae 
narrow, and the basal side much the longest pinnuled.
Pinnules various in size and form, some wanting all but a 
dentated fragment, mostly unequally cut aiad multicrisped.
My 
thanks are due to Mr. Barnes for fronds.

habit.
Found in the Mountain of Voil Famma, near Ruthin, 
Denbighshire, by Mr. T.
Pritchard.
The characteristic difference 
from incisum consists in the apices of the pinnae being 
singularly multifid, as well as the apex of the frond; forming 
a brief terminal expanded tuft, merging into those of the 
pinnse.
The pinnae narrow in some degree towards the 
multifid apex, whilst the apices of the pinnae expand into a 
number of flat-spreading nearly recurving segments, extending 
into lengthy points.

This variety belongs to the incisuni type, and is 
a monstrous form whose fronds have been found to' perish in 
the autumn six weeks sooner than the variety multijidum.
It 
is both beautiful and ornamental in its form and habit.
The 
distinctive character of this charming Fern consists in the 
apices of the pinna?
being furcately divided into five or six 
normal-looking points, being plane (not crisped.) The apex 
of the frond is also two or three times forked.
The fronds 
are lanceolate, symmetrical, and eighteen or twenty inches in 
length.
The pinn;c distant below, oblong, and scarcely narrowed 
below the three- or five-fingered termination to each pinna.

(Fig. 423.)â€” This Queen of Ferns was 
accidentally discovered by Mr. James Cosh, while on a botanical 
ramble in the year 1861, by the side of a bye-way that runs along 
the margin of a wood on the Buchanan estate, Stirlingshire, 
the property of His Grace the Duke of Montrose.
Being a 
large plant it attracted the attention of Mr. Cosh, who however 
allowed it to remain in its original situation till the summer 
of 1863, when Mr. John Connon, the gardener at Buchanan, 
having had his attention drawn to this curious Fern, and 
being aware of how great an acquisition it was, had it 
transferred to the garden.
Mr. Moore gave it the name of 
Victorice, considering it worthy of that high distinction, and 
the editor of the "West of Scotland Horticultural Magazine" 
fully described it in May, 1864.
The original plant is still 
at Buchanan; but by some means, not altogether legitimate, 
a portion of this plant got into other hands.
Length of frond 
eighteen inches, width five inches.
The pinnae, which average 
three inches in length, in the centre of the frond are branched.
The secondary rachis divides close to the junction with the 
main rachis into twin pinna?, one of which ascends at an 
angle of about 50Â°, and the other descends at the same 
angle; therefore each ascending pinna crosses the next two 
descending pinnre, and vice versa, thus forming a number of 
diamond-shaped spaces.
The pinna?
are linear, and an inch 
below their apices divide into three or four linear branches, 
which are multifid-crested.
The pinnae are slightly shorter 
towards the base, and gradually diminish in length towards 
the apex of the frond, which is also digitately multifid.
Two inches below the multifid apex of the frond the pinnÂ® 
become very small, and are not branched at their tips.
Pimife 
sub-opposite below, alternate above.
Pinnules small and entire, 
divided to the rachides for half the length of the pinn^, and 
then decurrent to the apex, being merely a row of small 
teeth on either side of the rachides.
Mr. John Sadler has 
described this variety in the "Bot. Soc.
Edin.
Trans.," vol.
ATHYRIUM FILIX-FCEMINA.

This variety he thus describes: â€” "In February, 
18G3, while at Alloa, I obtained from jNIr. Dawson and Mr.
Paterson, dried fronds of a singularly beautiful variety of 
Atltyrium Filix-faunina, a living plant of which I now 
exhibit.
I was informed that it had been collected in 18(>2 
by a young gentleman, Mr. James Cosh, in a wild state by 
a roadside in Stirlingshire, near Loch Lomond, and on the 
estate of Buchanan.
In the spring of last year I sowed a 
few of the spores, some of which germinated, and are now 
mostly thriving young plants, but as yet shewing no marked 
symptoms of their parent's peculiarity.
As I could find no 
description in Moore's 'British Ferns' answering to my plant, 
I transmitted the fronds to that gentleman, when he wrote 
me as follows: â€” 'The variety oi Filix-fcejnina is quite new, so 
far as I know, and is a very beautiful one.
As a queen 
amongst Lady Ferns it would well bear to be called Victorice.'' 
AccordiT}gly it is published under this name in Mr. Fraser's 
List of British Ferns and their Varieties, recently issued.
The 
fronds are from ten to eighteen inches in length, and crested 
at the apex.
The pinn?e are also crested, and instead of 
being single as in all the other varieties, they leave the rachis 
in pairs, and at such an angle, that each alternate pair overlaps 
the other so as to give a beautiful plaited appearance to the 
whole fronds." For fronds I am indebted to Professor 
Balfour, of Edinburgh; Mr. Sadler, of Edinburgh; Mr. P.
Neill Eraser, of Cannonmills Lodge, Edinburgh; and to Mr.
John Connon, of the Buchanan Gardens.

Fronds very various, some broad 
and of a normal plumose character, not nulike those of the 
Male Fern; others very much altered in form and width, 
some only changed at the apex, others brandling and furcate 
on the one side of the rachis and very brief on the other 
side, some branching near the base and others near the apex, 
whilst others are remarkably contracted, being scarcely one 
inch and a half wide in a frond of twelve inches in lens'th.
It is scarcely possible to describe this variety, as it varies in 
so extraordinary a degree in all ])arts of the fronds, and in 
one frond from another.
Usual length fifteen inches.

(Fig. 453.) â€” Raised from spores 
in 1864, by Mr. R.
Craig, of Levens Hall, Milnthorpe.
A 
singular form, twelve inches in length, the frond narrow, and 
equal in width for the basal third, namely, two inches, then 
suddenly widest, that is, four inches and a half, gradually 
tapering to one inch and three quarters, and then suddenly 
becoming only half an inch for the three inches near the 
apex, the extreme end being acuminate.
The pinnae are 
various in form, the basal ones for four or five pairs des- 
cending; the pinnules leafy, much cut on their upper margin 
and at the end, the superior basal pinnule much larger, the 
upper portions usually undivided to the rachides.
The central 
longer pinnae often furcate, the pinnules irregular in size and 
form, laciniate, depauperate, or even wanting, frequently only 
a toothed lobe of diminutive size, in fact the frond is almost 
all teeth.
The sori is situated on the inner margin of the 
teeth, so that it is marginal.
Sori conspicuous and abundant 
from the base to the apex of the frond.

Stansfieldh, Loice.
(Fig. 488.) â€” A remarkable dwarf form 
in the Frizellice section.
Length of frond five inches, width 
from one half to three quarters of an inch.
Slender, linear.
Pinnae brief, consisting merely of a rounded much-cut segment, 
which is petiolate, not unlike an oak tree in form.
The apex 
of the frond terminating abruptly.
I am indebted to Messrs.

(Plate XXXIX â€” A.) â€” An interesting 
dwarf variety, originally found at Xettlecombe, by Mr. C.
Elworthy.
Subsequently a number of varieties differing some- 
what from laciniatum have been referred to this species by 
Mr. Thomas Moore; these were found near Thirsk, Yorkshire, 
by Mr. A.
Clapham; Todmorden, by Mr. A.

fronds.
Generally lanceolate.
The pinnae very irregular, some 
brief, others acuminate, others prsemorse.
Pinnules decurrent, 
various in size and form, irregularly and profoundly laciniated.
Sori abundant and crowded about the base of the laciniated 
lobes.
Sometimes the fronds are considerably depauperated, 
the pinnae being only of the size of ordinary pinnules, flabellate, 
lobate, truncate, and palmate intermingled.
Sometimes the 
pinnules are nearly all depauperated.
I am indebted to

Frizelli^-cristatum, Lowe.
(Fig. 490.) â€” An interesting 
dwarf Fern raised from spores in 1864 by Mr. Thomas Glover, 
of Smedlcy Hill, Manchester.
Length of frond five inches 
and a half, width only three eighths of an inch, being equal 
in width throughout the frond, except at the apex, where it 
becomes branched and crested, the cristate apex being an 
inch and a half in width.
The pinnae resemble those of 
ATIIVllTUM riLIX-F(FMIN.\.
143 
Frizellicc, hence its name.
The fronds furnished to nie were 
of the second growth, and small, it therefore probably attains 
twice the size as here quoted.
My thanks arc due to Mr.
Thomas Glover for fronds.

GENUS VII.
ASPLENIUM.
LiNNyEus.
An interesting group of Ferns which is somewhat well 
represented in Great Britain.
Fronds herbaceous or membranaceous, and coriaceous.
Simple 
lobed, pinnate, bipinnate, or decompound.
The rachis or veins 
in some proliferous.
Caudex brief, erect or decumbent.
Sori indusiate, linear, short or elongate.
The receptacles 
lateral, on the anterior side of the veins.
Indusium linear and 
membranaceous.
Veins simple, or forked from a central costa.
Asplcniimi differs from Athyrium in having the sori straight, 
and from Scolope?idrium in having single fructification, that is, 
not in pairs standing face to face.
The spore-cases grow along 
the side of the vein, and the indusium is also attached laterally.
The British Aspleninms are divided into two groups, namely, 
Euasplenmm and Acroptei'is.
In Euasplenium are lanccolatum, fontanum, adiantum-nigrumy 
marinum, trichomanes, and ciride.
In Acroptcris are ruta-innraria, Germanicum, and septen- 
trionale.
In Euasplenium we have the sori oblong or linear, with the 
veins simple or forked, and diverging from a central costa; 
and in Acropteris we have linear elongate sori, with flabellately- 
forked veins without a costa.

This species is found more or less in the neighbourhood of 
the sea.
A native of Cornwall, abundant about the Land's End and 
Penzance, and found at St. Ives and Enys Penryn.
In Devon- 
shire on Morwell Eocks, on the banks of the Tamar and 
Plym, Eickley Vale, Marwood, Shaugh, Lynmouth, Buckland 
Monachorum, Tavistock, Salconibe, and Torquay.
In Somer- 
setshire at Selworthy, etc.
In Sussex and Kent, at Tunbridc^e 
Wells.
In Gloucestershire, at Frenchay, Beechly, and near 
Stapleton.
In Wales, in Pembrokeshire, Glamorganshire, 
Merionethshire, Carnarvonshire, and Denbighshire.
In Ireland, only found at Kinsale, Cork, where it was 
discovered by Mr. J.
Woods.
Also found in Guernsey, Jersey, Scilly, and Ramsay Islands.
Abroad it is a native of Madeira, Azores, Algiers, Tangier, 
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and France.
A handsome Fern, easily grown in a well-drained compost 
of peat loam and sand.
It requires a sheltered situation, and 
a mild climate, and detests excessive moisture.
The fronds vary from four inches to eighteen inches in 
length, are rigid, and of a brilliant green colour.
Lanceolate and pinnate.
Pinna?
ovate-lanceolate, broadest at the base, and narrowing 
to the apex, scarcely stalked, the lower more distant.
Pinnules obovate, obliquely-ovate, somewhat cuncate at the 
base.
In the large fronds the pinnules are jjinnatifid below, 
with mucronately-toothed lobes.
Stipes brief, about one third of the length of the frond, 
dark chcsnut-colourcd below, the dark colour extending: alonsr 
the back of the rachis.
Stipes and rachis sparingly scaly.
Cavidex brief, thick, tufted, and densely scaly.
ASrr.KNU'M LANCICOI-AITM.
153 
Sori scattered over the whole under side of the frond.
Indu- 
siatc, oblong, and produced along th(> anterior sides of the 
venules, submarginal, and eventually confluent.
Indusium white.
Veins of the pinnules consisting of a 
flexuosc midvein, alternately branched.
This species is more nearly allied to Asplenium luliantum- 
nigrum than any other British Fern, yet differs in the form 
of the frond, by its hair-scales on its rachides, in its oblong 
sori, and by the spores being produced above the fork of the 
veins, w^hilst in adiantum-nigrum it is below the forking.
It has also a thinner frond, and the pinnules more equal 
in size.
I am indebted to Mr. Clift, of Balsall Moor, Birmingham, 
for a very flne plant, a collector to whom I shall have again 
to refer, and who has found some excellent forms of British 
Ferns.
There are very few varieties of this species.

Kalon, Loioe.
(Fig. 495.) â€” Found in Devonshire in 186-i.
The frond nearly equal in width, only slightly diminishing in 
the basal pair of pinna; and near the apex; the frond termi- 
nating in a square wide apex.
The basal pinnae descending, 
the others horizontal, and the apical pair ascending.

their ajjex blunt, triangular-rotund.
Pinnules petiolate, except 
at the apex of the pinntc, distant, large; their base cuneate, 
entire; their margins minutely fringed with diminutive teeth; 
occasionally the pinnules are wanting.
Length from four to 
five inches; colour a rich green.
My thanks are due to 
Messrs.
Stansfield for fronds.

Obtusum, Clapliam.
(Fig. 496.) â€” A distinct form raised 
from spores by Mr. A.
Clapham, of Scarborough.
The fronds, 
which are from eight to ten inches in length, terminate 
obtusely.
The pinnte are broader at the base.
The basal 
pinnules are much larger, more divided, and more distant.
]My thanks are due to Mr. Clapham for fronds.

Aspleninm â€” Spleenwort.
SeptentrionaJe â€” Nortbern.
Although not an uncommon European species, still the 
Asplenium septentrionale is a rare British Fern, of dwarf 
size and rupestral habit, growing in the fissures of rocks, and 
on loose stone walls.
We have recorded as localities for this species in West- 
morland, the neighbourhood of Ambleside; in Cumberland, 
Helvellyn, in tiie Vale of Newlands, Honiston Crags; 
Scawfell, Patterdale, Keswick, Wastwater, and Borrowdale; 
in Northumberland, at Kyloe Crags; in Yorkshire, Ingleborough; 
in Somersetshire, Culborne, near Oare Church, and Exmoor.
In Scotland, Eoxburghshire, Edinburghshire, Perthshire, and 
Aberdeenshire.
In Wales, near Llanrwst, Pass of Llanberris, Bettwys-y-Coed, 
Capel Curig, Pont-y-Pair, and Llewellyn.
It does not occur in Ireland.
Abroad it is found in Scandinavia, Russia, France, Belgium, 
Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Italy, 
Northern India, and New Mexico.
The fronds, which are evergreen, are from two to six 
inches in length, deep green, and coriaceous.
Sometimes 
simple, sometimes forked, and either entire or with a few 
distant marginal teeth, or divided into several lobes.
The fronds are tapering towards both extremities.
Caudex brief, stout, often densely crowded with fronds.
Stipes usually longer than the frond.
Sori linear, elongate.
Indusium entire.
Like all other rock plants it delights best to grow hori- 
zontally amongst lumps of porous sandstone in sandy soil.
It does not appear subject to varieties.

164 ASPLENIUM FONTANUM.
A DWARF Fern, witli bipinnate, narrow, or linear-lanceolate 
fronds, broadest upwards, rigid and glabrous.
Fronds varying 
from three to twelve inclies, usually four or five inches, and 
dark green in colour.
A very rare British Fern, growing on rocks and walls.
It has been found in Hampshire, near Peterfield, in 1852, 
by the Eev. W.
H. Hawker; in Swanage Cave, Isle of Purbeck, 
also in 1852, by Dr. Power; in Surrey, near Tooting, in 1845, 
by Mr. Gibbs.
INIr. A.
Shepherd records it as found at 
Matlock; Mr. R.
M. Redhead in Wharncliffe Wood, Yorkshire; 
Mr. P.
Brown near Alnwick Castle, Northumberland; Mr.
Hudson (who first discovered it as British) at Wybourn, 
Westmorland; Mr. D.
Hutchison near Stonehaven, Kincar- 
dineshire; and Mr. Newnham at Cavehill, near Belfast.
It is found in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, 
Germany, Hungary, Greece, Siberia, and Kashmir.
Readily grown in a well-drained pot, and porous soil of 
turfy peat, with a slight ]3ortion of friable loam and abundance 
of gritty silver-sand.
A greenhouse variety requiring care in 
not over-watering.
Caudex brief, erect, and somewhat scaly.
Stipes brief, slender, dark purplish brown, becoming green 
upwards.
Rachis green, having a narrow elevated margin throughout, 
reaching nearly to the stipes.
Pinnte oblong-ovate, spreading, the basal ones smaller, more 
distant, and palmately three-lobed.
The upper ones crowded 
and oblong.
Pinnules roundish-obovate, tapering to the base; the basal 
ones stalked, the upper ones decurrent, their margins spinosely- 
mucronately dentate.
Sori brief, oblong, most copious upwards, but covering the 
whole under surface of the frond.
Veins consisting of a flexuose costa with alternate simple 
veins.
There is a form known as Halleri, but it is doubtful whether 
the variation is not owing to cultivation.
There is also another form which Mr. Moore refers to this 
species known as var.
refractum, (Plate XLII.
â€” B.,) whose 
history is obscure.
ASPLENIUM FONTANUM.

Mr. Moore mentions at page 65, vol.
ii., of his ''Nature- 
l)riutcd British Ferns," that "it in sonic respects approaches 
the North American Asplenmm ebencum." I have long con- 
sidered this Fern to be a variety of A.
ehenciim ; and a letter 
recently received from Mr. Clapham, of Scarborough, a culti- 
vator of Ferns of great discernment, strengthens my opinion, 
as he also considers ebeneum as the parent of this plant.
It 
is therefore placed as a variety of this Fern with every 
confidence of having removed it to the right species.

or under pot-culture in a greenliousc.
The caudex is brief, stout, tufted, and scaly.
Stipes often longer than the leafy portion of the frond, 
dark purple, and smooth.
Rachis channeled in front.
Length of frond from three inches to two feet, and from 
an inch and a half to seven inches wide at the base; shining 
deep green above, paler beneath.
Deltoid or ovate, and 
tapering to an acuminated apex; bi pinnate, tripinnate, or even

Pinncc oblong-triangular, mostly elongate, and with an 
attenuated apex.
The basal ones the largest and opposite, 
above alternate.
Pinnules alternate; the basal ones situated on the anterior 
side of the rachis, and much larger than the others, broadly 
oblique-ovate, with an attenuated apex, pinnate or pinnatifid 
at the base, the segments ovate-obtuse.
The ultimate divisions 
notched with distinct acute serratures.
Veins furcate.
Sori linear-elongate, indusiate on the anterior side of the

The lowest pinna?, which are the 
largest, are opposite, and of a similar outline to the frond 
itself.
The apices of the frond and pinnules caudate, with a 
few sharp, deep, and distant teeth.
The lower lobes are 
three-toothed, those above bifid, whilst at the apex only simple 
toothed.
Veins furcate, slender, but very distinct.
Sori very

and in Devonshire by the Rev. J.
M. Chanter.
Fronds six 
to eight inches in length, broadest at the base, where nearly 
three inches across, pyramidal, with an irregular outline, owing 
to the unequal length of the pinnae.
Pinnee distinctly pinnate 
at the base, but slightly adnate and decurrent above, and in 
the upper part are confluent into a broad irregular pinnatifid 
apex.
The outline of the distinct pinnre hastate, owing to a 
rounded auricle, both on the anterior and posterior sides.
In 
the basal pinna3 the auricles become lobes divided half-way 
down to the costa, above the auricle they taper to an acute 
point.
The margin is everywhere minutely and sharply 
denticulate.
Sori numerous, placed near the costa, mostly 
scolopendrioid.

Travers 
Smith, who found it in an old wall at Tramore, ('ounty of 
Waterford, and gave it to Mrs. B.
Hone, of A^evay, Ballybrack, 
Dalkey, near Dublin.
Mrs. B.
Hone forwarded fronds and a 
plant of this singular variety.
Length of frond eight inches, 
width from an inch to an inch and a half, except at the 
tasseled apex, where it becomes two inches and a half wide.
A depauperated variety, occasionally pinnte opposite, but more 
frequently the opposite pinmc absent.
Usually only three or 
four pinnfe, the greater portion of the stipes being naked.
Pinna?
leafy, variously cut and differing much from each other 
in form; and much serrated on the margin.
Two inches and a 
half below the apex of the frond the stipes dilates and becomes 
flat, and then branches and divides many times, forming a 
more or less circular tassel termination with a cuneate base.
My thanks are due to Mrs. B.
Hone for a plant and fronds.

This Fern grows wilh rcnuirkablc luxuriauce along the west 
coast of Irehmd, in the County of Clare, where Mr. F.
J. 
Foot, A.M., C.E., of the Geological Survey of Ireland, procured 
a number of fronds, larger, 1 believe, than were ever before found 
in the British Isles.
In 13urron, County of Clare, abundant 
all alonÂ«; the north coast as far as Harbour Hill, near Bally- 
vaughan, growing in the chinks or open joints of the limestone, 
attaining a length of three feet, and mostly exceeding two 
feet, varying considerably in the size and shape of the pinnae 
and sori, and closely resembling exotic ones, the Asplcnhwi 
Icetum, for instance.
Mr. Foot read a paper on the "Distribu- 
tion of Plants in Burron, County of Clare," at the Royal 
Irish Academy, in April, 1862, (see page 143, of vol.
xxiv of 
the Transactions of this Society.) 
Few British Ferns make more interesting specimens under 
pot-culture.
There are some very distinct varieties: â€”

Pinnte somewhat distant, from two inches to two 
inches and a half long, and less than three eighths of an 
inch wide, nearly parallel-sided, the base cuneate, the margin 
coarsely but not profoundly crenate-serrate.

The remaining lobes 
shorter, yet narrow and deeply divided, having open spaces 
between them.
I believe it is never fertile.

they are uncut on the margin, merely being minutely serrate.
The pinnae arc placed so close to each other that they overlap 
fully one half of their width, and arc consequently very 
much imbricated; the basal pinnae are descending, and the 
remainder slightly ascending; they also arch forwards, so as to 
place the stipes in a hollow between the row of pinnae on 
either side.
The frond is equal in width to near the apex, 
where it rapidly contracts to a blunt decurrcnt ultimate pinna, 
llachis and stipes hirsute.
A very distinct form.

Mr. Moore describes one frond in his "Nature 
Printed British Ferns," which has the rachis divided about 
two thirds up; below the ramification are eight small pinnae, 
the rachis then divides into five branches of an inch in length, 
forming a spreading apex two inches and a half broad, and 
one of these branches is furcate.

(Figs.
545 and 546.) â€” This very distinct 
Fern was found, I believe, in Devonshire, by the late Mr.
C. Jackson, and is now in the possession of Mrs. Thompson, of 
South Lawn, Exeter, being one of a number of very fine varieties 
of British Ferns in the possession of Mrs. Thompson.
The length 
is fourteen inches, being widest at the base, and very gradually 
narrowing to the apex.
The pinnae are alternate, narrow and 
long, and very conspicuously auricled, especially so in the 
basal pinnas; the superior margin is crenate-serrate and biden- 
tate, yet not deeply divided; the inferior margin, on the 
contrary, is very deeply cut into narrow segments, some of 
the basal ones being even stipitate with the costa, and as these 
segments are more or less at right angles to the costa, the 
plant has a much laciniated appearance in a regular manner.
Stipes and rachis ebeneous.
I am indebted to Mrs. Thompson 
for fronds of this very beautiful variety.

An exceedingly pretty rupestral species, found growing on 
ruins, rocks, and walls, at all elevations from the sea level up 
to two thousand feet, and most abundant in the west of 
England.
A very common Fern, found in nearly every part of 
England, being most rare in the eastern counties.
A native 
also of Wales, the Isle of Wight, in Scotland from north to 
south, Orkney, Ireland, and the Channel Isles.
Abroad it is in Scandinavia, Hussia, Siberia, France, Italy, 
Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Turkey,

Mr. W.
Andrews, of Dublin, has found examples in the 
west of Ireland; and Mr. R.
Barrington others from Galway 
that are ,of great size, more than a foot long, having pinna; 
half an inch long and a quarter of an inch broad, and about 
thirty pairs of pinnae on each frond.
This Fern is not the easiest of our British species to 
cultivate in pots.
It succeeds best in a compost of porous 
loamy soil, lumps of sandstone, and lime from old walls.
An 
excess of moisture is fatal to it, nevertheless with proper 
drainage I have found plunging the pots in leaf-soil is the 
most successful treatment.
AV^hen planted in sandy peat or 
leaf-mould, Mr. G.
B. Wollaston has found the jilants did not 
flourish.
Planted on rock-work, where it can take its natural 
position, and its roots can penetrate between the crevices, its 
beauty is shewn to perfection.
The fronds are linear and pinnate; the pinna; usually 
roundish-oblong, obliquely wedge-shaped at the base, and 
crenated, yet variable in form.
The stipes short, smooth, and 
brown, rounded behind and flat in front, terminal, and 
adherent to the rhizoma.
Rachis dark brown also.
Caudex short and tufted.
The fronds vary from two to eighteen inches in length.
Pinna; deep green, blunt at the apex, scarcely stalked.
Veins forking from a midvein, and terminating within the 
margin.
The fructification distributed over the frond.
Sori linear, 
oblique, numerous, indusiate, eventually confluent.
This Fern has some general resemblance to Asple/iiufn viride.
There are several varieties, a portion of which are singularly 
distinct.
Incisum, Moore.
(Fig. 548.) â€” Found in Devonshire by the 
Rev. W.
S. Hore; Kent Clough, near Burnley, Lancashire, by 
Mr. S.
Gibson; in Burrowdale, Cumberland, by Miss AVright.
It is also said to have been found in Jersey, and in County 
Clare.
In 1860, Mr. Edmund Thomas Higgins, of No. 18, 
Kingsdown Parade, Bristol, found a plant near Pyle, in Gla- 
morganshire, which in 1862 was noticed to bear fertile fronds, 
though sparingly.
One of the most beautiful and rare of 
British Ferns.
The fronds are pinnate, and of the ordinary

outline.
The pinnre are soraewliat triangular, with acute apices, 
profoundly pinnatifid, the segments narrow-oblong, or elliptic, 
mostly acute and irregularly and profoundly serrated, tjie larger 
ones often lobate.
This variety has always been considered as 
barren, but recently I have received fertile fronds from Mr.
Higgins' plant, and this, I think, is the only instance of the 
plant being known to be fertile.
Length of frond four to six 
inches.
My thanks are due to Mr. Joseph Henderson, of 
Wentworth, for fronds gathered from an excellent specimen in 
Earl Fitzwilliam's magnificent collection of Ferns.

County Clare, by Dr. Kinahan; near Windermere by Mr. F.
Clowes; near Keswick by Miss Wriijht; and in Owsnip Gill, 
Swaledale, by Mr. Robert C.
Brown, of Nottingham.
A much- 
branched variety.
The rachis is two or three times forked, 
and the apical lobes often enlarged and bifid or multifid.
The 
pinna; are not unfrequently irregular or depauperate, and as 
often conspicuously crenate.
The illustration is from Mr.
Brown's frond.
BiFURCUM, Wollaston.
(Fig. 5-50.) â€” Found near Maidstone 
by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston; on the wall of Hoddam Kirkyard, 
in Dumfriesshire, by Mr. W.
G. Johnstone; and in Owsnip 
Gill, Swaledale, by Mr. Robert C.
Brown, of Nottingham.
Its 
peculiarity consists in having the apical lobe dilated, and two 
or three times forked.
My thanks are due to Mr. Brown for 
a plant and fronds.

A large variety, bearing 
some resemblance to crenato-lohatum ; the peculiarity consisting 
in the pinnae (especially in the centre of the frond) having at 
their base two deeply-divided broad obovate lobes, the lowest 
one sometimes separated almost to the midrib.

The fronds are 
sometimes narrowed and elongated, with the pinnae distinct; 
sometimes broad and shorter, with large crowded pinna;.
Differing in a remarkable degree in having the pinnce equal- 
sided at the base, the costa and the attachment being central.
The upper pinnae are oblong, the lower ones more frequently 
obtusely-deltoid, the margins being either slightly sinuated, 
forming a gently waving line, or deeply crcnate-dcntate, fre- 
quently elegantly crenated.

A pretty Fern, not uncommon in cultivation, 
of vigorous growth, and easily reproduced by spores.
The 
apex of the frond spreads out into a handsome symmetrical 
tuft or tassel, and this ramification is confined to the apex of 
the rachis.

Length of frond six inches.
Two inches 
above the base the rachis divides into two branches, and in 
the centre of this forking is a cornute projection.
The rachis 
is flexuose, and the one branch is shorter and more slender 
than the other, with much smaller pinnae, and a larger 
decurrent ultimate pinna of half the size of the branch.
The 
pinnjc are lax two or three below the forking, naked imme- 
diately above the forking, above which alternate to the apex.
The pinnoe vary in size and form, mostly very long and 
narrow, and auriculate and serrated.
Some are cuneate, and 
a small portion depauperate.
The ultimate pinna dilate and 
bifid.
My thanks are due to Mr. Edwards, of Nuthall, for

I have therefore thought none other would be more 
appropriate than Claphami, after the Mell-known collector and 
cultivator of so many fine English varieties.

the pinnai sometimes measure three quarters of an inch in 
length, and three quarters of an inch across the base, the 
basal lobes right and left being cut down nearly to the costa, 
and themselves lobate, having the segments serrate and the 
upper lobes cut in proportion.

Ramo-lobatum, Moore.
(Fig. 573.) â€” A large-growing form 
Avith fronds seven or eight inches in length, recently found near 
Xettlecombe, by Mr. C.
Elworthy.
It is a branched form, with 
the lobes of the pinnse divided to the rachides, and the margin 
coarsely crenated.
The illustration is from Mr. Elworthy's frond.
Grandidens, Loioe.
(Fig. 574.) â€” Found in South Devon, 
by Mr. W.
Edwards, of Nuthall, Nottinghamshire.
A dwarf 
form of scarcely three inches in length.
Pinnee various in size 
and shape, the basal ones auriculate and the upper ones much 
laciniated, occasional pinnre are all but absent; copiously sori- 
ferous.
I am indebted to Mr. Edwards, for fronds.
Willi soNii, Willison.
â€” Found near Whitby by Mr. WilHson.
So nearly allied to the form conjluens of Moore, as to be 
doubtfully distinct.
I must confess that the only difference 
214 
ASPLENIUM TRICHOMANES.
that I detect are the more distant three pairs of basal pinnae, 
the more equal sized and shaped pinnae, and the minutely- 
crenate margin.
A pretty form, of some four inches in length.
I am indebted to Mr. Willison, of Whitby, for fronds.
Majus, Hort.
â€” A large-growing form found in Devonshire, 
and in County Clare, and other places.
It is of the normal 
form, with fronds from twelve to eighteen inches in length.
I am indebted to the Eev. C.
Padley, of Beaconfield, near 
Plymouth, for a number of Devon fronds, and to Mr. Foot, 
of the Geological Survey of Ireland, for others from County 
Clare.
An illustration is unnecessary.
CuNEATUM, Lowe.
â€” Raised from spores at Highfield House.
Length of frond three inches.
The pinnae are elongate- 
triangular, broad and flat at the apex, and cuneate at the 
base.
The margin serrated.
The ultimate pinna three times 
the size of the others.
There are yet seven varieties that I have been unable to 
get a sight of, namely: â€” Abruptum, Moore; bifurcum-ramosum, 
Moore; crenuto-ramosum, Moore; dichotomum, Moore; inciso- 
lohatam, Sim; lobatum-ramosum, Moore; and rariatis, Moore.

GENUS VIII.
SCOLOPENDRIUM.
Smith.
Caudex brief, stout, erect, or decumbent, and rarely sub- 
creeping, an illustration of this rare character being represented 
in Plate XLIX.
Fronds thick, herbaceous, and in the normal form simple; 
but the varieties are so numerous that the departures from 
the usual form must be mentioned when describing each 
variety.
Sori indusiate, linear, frequently elongated, situated close 
together in parallel pairs.
Indusium membranaceous, twin, the twin sorus opening 
along the centre.
Veins forked from a central costa, and terminating within 
the margin in club-shaped apices.
Scolopendriam is confined to one species in Great Britain, 
namely, Scolopendrium vulyare, and is a small genus in any 
country.
The late Sir W.
J. Hooker, in his "Species Filicum,"

Scolopendriumâ€” Yy&nvQ^ from Scolopendra, a genus of myriapods, 
because the lines of fructification resemble these many-legged crawling 
animals.
Vulgare â€” Common.
This elegant Fern is an inhabitant of moist shady banks 
and woods, delighting to groAV amongst underwood; also on 
damp rocks, walls, ruins, bridges, and the mouths of old w^ells 
and caves.
Spread throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, 
yet more or less local.
It is most abundant in Ireland and 
the Channel Isles, owing to the more humid climate, and less 
abundant in Scotland than in England.
Found at all altitudes 
up to six hundred feet, from the sea-side to the most inland 
situations; at Scarborough and Morecambe Bay, for instance, 
growing on the rocks exposed to the sea.
It is a native of the Island of Gothland (in the Baltic,) 
Russia, Holland, France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, 
Germany, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Dalmatia, Algeria, Madeira, 
the Azores, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Turcomania, Erzeroum, 
Persia, United States of America fnot common,) Mexico, Orkney, 
and Shetland.
The Scolopendrium mdgare from its distinct character, cool, 
refreshing-looking fronds, and elegant appearance, is deservedly 
a general favourite, and very largely cultivated in our Ferneries, 
and when planted en masse produces a pleasing feature, its 
simple fronds contrasting greatly with the species having much 
divided fronds.
It is successfully cultivated in a mixture of loam, peat, and 
sand; and imder pot-culture it is essential to secure good 
drainage.
It is readily propagated from divisions, and is easily 
reproduced from spores.
SCOLOPENDRIUM VULGAllE.

I found very few plants in Northern Spain, a few specimens 
being now and then met with at Santandcr, and here and 
there along the passes between Las Caldas and lieinosa.
In 
the neighbourhood of Nottingham it is only met with clothing 
the sides of wells, and on rocks more especially near Bramcote; 
at Matlock and Cromford, in Derbyshire, and at Chaigeley 
ISIanor, Lancashire, it is abundant in damp Avoods â€” very different 
situations to the exposed cliffs at Scarborough Castle, or the 
low banks close to the sea at Morecambe Bay.
Being very hardy and evergreen are other recommendations 
to its cultivation as regards its normal form, then again the 
immense number of extraordinary varieties have among them 
scores of beautiful and remarkable dissimilarities.
The normal fronds are broadly-linear or oblong strap-shaped; 
entire, with an attenuated apex; base caudate.
Stipes scaly.
Caudex brief, thick, and tufted, with a scaly crown.
Stipes usually one third the length of the frond.
Length of frond from two inches to above two feet, deep rich 
green, and fleshy in texture.
Fructification abundant, usually 
most so towards the apex.
Sori linear, oblique, and growing in pairs.
The varieties are so numerous, and their characters so 
distinct from the normal form, that a description of the usual 
frond gives a very inadequate idea of this remarkable species.
We shall therefore at once proceed to describe this numerous 
family of departures from the normal form.
Crenato-lobatum, Moore.
(Fig. 594.) â€” A large-growing 
elegant variety found at Ilfracombe, Devon, by the Rev. J.

sometimes, however, as in the Oidstead examples, being widest 
at the centre of the frond.
The margin (and more especially 
in the upper portion) is distinctly crenato-lobate, and occasionally

Proliferum, Wollaston.
(Fig, 630.) â€” A singular monstrosity, 
which was raised from spores by Mr. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst.
It is of the marginatum group, dwarf, scarcely three inches in 
length, and usually the lamina only one inch long, and from 
three to five eighths of an inch wide, mostly oblong, sometimes 
cornute, profoundly and irregularly marginate; the excurrent 
membrane so very much developed, that the frond appears as 
if split in two edgewise on either side of the costa.
The upper 
surface of the frond irregularly verrucose.
It bears no sori, 
but on the surface of the frond are little bulbils, which ultimately 
form small plants resembling the parent.
Occasionally the fronds 
are AvhoUy stipes and costa, without any leafy portion, and these 
taper and are pointed like an awl.
My thanks are due to Mr.
Elworthy, of Nettlecombe, for a plant.

This magnificent variety, for which we are indebted 
to Mr. A.
Clapham, of Ramsdale Bank, Scarborough, has been 
described on page 245.
It has so much improved in its ramose 
character in the last two seasons, that it has been thought 
desirable to give an additional figure of a frond, though it 
has been found necessary to give the illustration on a much 
reduced scale.

CETEIMCH.
.W.) 
GENUS TX.
Caudex brief, erect, and tufted.
Fronds j)innatifid, coriaceous, densely scaly beneath, with 
imbricated chaffy scales.
Sori linear oblong, obsoletely indusiate, 
the receptacles lateral.
Veins forked from a central costa.
The character of Ceterach is midway between Asplenium and 
Gymnofjramma.
The late illustrious Sir W.
J. Hooker, in "Species Fillcum," 
places this solitary Fern with Asplenium in the sub-genus 
Hcmidicfijum.
A host of botanists give the rank of Ceterach, 
whilst others have united it with Seolopendrium, Vittaria, 
Gymnopteris, Grammitis, Gymnogr amine, AcrosUchcm, Bleeh- 
num, and Polyi)od'mm.
Sir W.
J. Hooker, in his large genus Asjilenium, numbering 
three hundred and five species, divides them into sub-genus 
1. â€” Thamnoptcris , seven species, A.
Anstralasicmn being an 
example; 2.
â€” Eiiasjilenium, two hundred and seven sj^ecies, 
A. marinum, A.
lucidum, A.
hidbtferum, A.
trichotnanes , and 
A. viviparum being examples; 3.
â€” Athyriwn, twenty-nine 
species, A.
filix-fcsmina and A.
nnihrosum being examples; 
4, â€” Eudiplazitim, fifty-one species,^, striahim being an example; 
5. â€” Anisogonium, seven species,^, esculentum being an example; 
and 0.
â€” Hemidictyum, four si^ccies, A.
marginatum and A.
ceterach being examples.
Mr. Thomas Moore, in "Index Filicum," retains the genus 
Ceterach, and does not agree in uniting the Mediterranean 
form aureum with our British ojficinarnm, notwitlistanding 
that my namesake, the Rev. R.
'J\ Tiowe, has found every 
variety of form and size uniting tlie two.

370 CETERACH.
Tlie obscure indusium is so marked a feature that I have 
followed the latter authority, preferring this to the bolder 
conception of uniting in one grand family such species as 
A. marinum, Athyrium filix-fcemina, Diplazium striatum^ 
Hemidicttjum marginatum, and Ceterach officinarum.
Only one British species.

It is doubtful wlu;ther the larger-growing Cetvrach Cana- 
ricnsis of" A\"illdenow is a distinct species.
The Ceterach is said to require a rough porous soil of 
sandy loam, with fragments of limestone, and kept rather dry.
The finest plants I have seen have been left to take care of 
themselves in a damp situation and a close heavy clayey soil, 
where the sun never shines, but exposed to the north.
Growing- 
wild thev are seldom found except on the south or sunny 
side of a wall.
There are but few varieties of this species that have come 
imder my notice.

LOMARIA.
WiLi.DKXoAv.
Fronds simple, pinnatificl or pinnate; the fertile fronds 
contracted.
Sori subniarginal or contracted, linear and indusiate, 
the indusiuni subintraniarginal.
The fertile fronds always contracted.
Moore, Benthani, Swartz, Schkuhr, Mettenius, and others, 
have considered the British Fern about to be described as a 
Blcchnum, and the sori when young closely agrees with 
Blechmim; yet I agree with the Late Sir W.
J. Hooker, that 
the habit and dimorphous fronds are so characteristic of 
Lomaria, as to make it imperative to place our "Flard Fern" 
in the genus Lomaria.
There is so great an affinity between 
Blechmim and Lomaria that Sclilechtendal has united the two 
genera, and his views have been adopted by other able 
pteridologists.
Sir W.
J. Hooker, in his "Species Filicum," enumerates 
fifty-five species as Lomaria, and forty as Blcchrmm.
A large family, but only one species a native of Great 
Britain.

(liscovcior, Mv. Aronkman, of ^falton, wlio holds tlu' only plant 
known, and sends the fronds for illustration.
Mr.
^lonkman 
first named this fine plant ramo-cristatum, but in consequence 
of tlu> more markedly fan-like forms assumed by the strongly- 
developed fronds, and the constantly increasing tendency to 
dichotomous forking, he was induced to ado])t th(> name 
'\f ((1)0110(11)71" as being the most descriptive.
Th(> plant is 
robust, but has not yet proved fertile.
The fronds branch into 
two, three, or four, at the stipes, each division again repeatedly 
forking, and the same process repeating until the Habellate 
form is made ui) of a dense nriss of foliage.
The large flat 
fronds hanging over the pot are v(>ry striking.

3Iostly an inhabitant of sea cliffs.
In 1860 I found this 
Fern abundant on the sea cliffs opposite the ladies' bathing 
place at Santander, in Spain, dwarf and stunted; hftv or 
sixty miles inland, at Las Caldas, it was most luxuriant, 
growing between crevices in rocks.
I measured some two 
feet in length.
It was also met with in the Congosto Pass 
near Allar, and seemed not uncommon along the spurs of the 
Pyrenees.
Not hardy, requiring the protection of a greenhouse, and 
flourishing best in a Avarm house.
Broken peat and silver sand, 
Avitli a little loam, is the proper compost.

Cystopteris â€” From the Greek hystos â€” a bladder, and pteris â€” a fern.
Fragilis â€” Fragile.
This pretty species grows in tlie fissures of moist rocks, 
usually in the shade, occurring from the sea level to three 
thousand feet elevation.
Widely distributed, and most abundant 
in mountainous districts.
A native of every county in Great 
Britain, yet least common in the south of England.

confined to the west and north-west.
Extending to the north 
of ScotLand, as tar as Orkney.
Abroad it occurs throughout 
Europe; also along the Ural and Altai ranges, Siberia, 
Kamtschatka, Asia Minor, Affghanistan, Kashmir, Simla, 
Nepal, Thibet, the Himalaya range; Abyssinia, Cape of Ciood 
Hope, Madeira, TcnerifFe, Canaries, Azores, Greenland, Lab- 
rador, Canada, United States, California, Mexico, Guatemala, 
Columbia, Xalapa, Quito, Peru, Jamaica, Cuba, Bahamas, 
New Grenada, Chili, and Tasmania.
Cystopteris fragilis delights to occupy crevices in limestone 
rocks that are somewhat moist, and its pretty small fragile 
fronds are a pleasing feature in those districts in which it is 
sufficiently abundant.
In a situation that is suitable to this 
species its spores germinate in great abundance.
In 18G0 I found it remarkably abundant in Spain along 
the damp rocks on the Vilia Escusa, between Reinosa and 
Allar, whilst in the more exposed situations it was not to be 
found; it was also abundant near Santander and Las Caldas.
In various parts of England it is not uncommonly so abundant 
as to give a character to the place; thus at Matlock, in 
Derbyshire, near Chaigeley, in Lancashire, about Bath, in tlie 
lake district, and in numerous parts of North and South AVales 
it lives in lovely luxuriance.
When grown as a pot j^lant this Fern should have ample 
drainage, and the usual proportions of turfy peat and loam, 
with a liberal supply of sand and small lumps of limestoiie.
It succeeds well as a cultivated plant.
The fronds are frequently attacked by Urcdo filicum, a yellow 
fungus, which seriously disfigures those plants that are attacked 
by it.
There are some interesting varieties, namely: â€” 
Dentata, Hooker.
(Plate LXIV.

spread form.
Length six to eight inches; bipinnate or 
sub-bijjinnate; pinnules oblong, bluntly dentate.

Length from one to two inches.
Fronds from two to six inches in length, and of a dull green 
colour.
Pinnae more distant below and spreading.
Sori copious, and situated below the apex of the venules.
Circular.
The pecidiarity of this genus consists in the small concave 
scale which rests on the vein below the sorus, having a fringed 
margin spreading over the spore-cases.
This rare Fern grows in the crevices of moist rocks in 
mountains, at an altitiule of twelve hundred to two thousand 
feet.

TRICHOMANES.
Linn.^us.
Ai-THOUGII this genus is represented in Great Britain by a 
solitary sjiccies, Sir W.
J. Hooker has described no less than 
eighty-seven species in his "Sjjecies Filicnm," and of these 
thirteen are found in Jamaica, eleven in Java, eight in 
Guinea, seven in Brazil, five in Bourbon, five in the Mauritius, 
five in New Zealand, four in Madagascar, and four in Peru, 
and the remaining twenty-five are one or more of them to be 
met with in Ceylon, Mexico, Nepal, Cayenne, Orinoco, Chiloc, 
Sierra Leone, Barbadoes, West Africa, East Indies, West Indies, 
Onalau, British Guiana, or the Islands of Falkland, Luzon, 
Juan Fernandez, Sandwich, Philippine, Pacific, or Seychelles.
This genus is widely spread over the warmer regions of the 
world.
Trichomanes is closely allied to Hijmenophijllum, yet easily 
recognised from that genus.
The distinguishing feature in 
Trichomanes is the peculiar entire urn-like cu]i in which the 
spore-cases are developed; whilst in HymenophijUum this is 
split down to the base into two divisions.

localities not made j)ublic.
It has been found growing luxuriantly in some abundance 
in several places, extending over several miles in Wales, but 
the localities have been kept secret; indeed it has been found 
necessary to refrain from making the habitats known, from a 
dread of its extermination by collectors, as has already been 
the case in some localities; this Fern fetching a high price, 
and therefore being much sought after, is an inducement to 
uproot it whereyer found.
Abroad it is a native of Spain, of Teneriffe, the Canary 
Isles, Madeira, and the Azores, India, Jamaica, Martinique, 
Mexico, Panama, New Grenada, Brazil, Venezuela, in the 
Galapagos and Society Isles, and Sandwich Islands.
Fronds six to sixteen inches in length, of which the stipes 
is from a third to a half of this length, membranaceous, pellucid, 
smooth, and dark olive green.
Ovate-triangular, the apex some- 
what attenuate.
Tripinnatifid.
The pinnse ovate-lanceolate, with 
oblong segments, dentate; the teeth being brief and linear.
TRICHOMANES UADICANS.

Stipes above hav^ing a narrow membranaceous margin or wing.
Kachis margined tliroughout with this membranaceous wing.
Veins branched, in the sterile fronds terminating within the 
margin, and in fertile fronds continued beyond the margin, and 
forming the receptacle.
Fructification extra-marginal.
Involucre cup-shaped.
The sterile fronds will remain on the plant, if uninjured, 
for a number of years, and the fertile fronds require several 
years to arrive at maturity.
I have large plants growing in great luxuriance, which are 
grown in large pans filled above the drainage with lumps of 
freestone, amongst which is a compost of lumps of peat and a 
moderate sprinkling of silver-sand; when planted the rhizomas 
were pegged tightly to the peat and stones.
These pans 
were elevated in larger pans filled with water, which made a 
canal of water round the plants, and the whole placed in square 
glass frames, having a glass lid to ojien in order to water, 
which is thrown on the fronds in a small shower every 
morning.
This glass frame is a great advantage over the 
bell-glass, as the fronds remain untouched.
The plants are 
grown in a shady portion of a greenhouse.
There are several varieties: â€”

United States, Mexico, and Brazil.
This Fern grows erect and trunk -like, with a stipes half the 
length of the frond, smooth and pale green (except when young.) 
Fronds more or less erect, varying in length from two to 
twelve feet, and bright yellow green in colour; membranaceous.
Bipinnate to tripinnate, broadly lanceolate in form.
The 
fronds are part sterile, and 2^^i't have a terminal fertile 
panicle.
Sterile pinnse sub-opposite, ovate-lanceolate, and 
distant.
Pinnules from an inch to two inches and a half long, 
sessile, oblong-ovate, with a somewhat widened base, occasionally 
auricled or deeply lobed.
A'eins forked near the base.
Fructification.
The whole or a portion of the uj^pcr pinnae 
transformed into a bipinnate, contracted, inflorescent panicle.
Spore-cases crowded on the margin.
At Santander, in the north of Sj^ain, in 1860, I saw numerous 
dwarf plants in the crevices of low rocks by the sea side, where 
they would be frequently washed by sea waves, 
A dozen years ago three plants alone remained in the fields 
of Mr. C.
Allcock, at Bui well, Nottinghamshire.
They were 
evidently dying from being too dry, as the land had been drained.
I brought one to Highfield House, and it has become a large 
plant bearing fronds six feet in length.
The others, in their 
native habitat, lingered for a couple of years and then died.
It would be a difficult matter to find a more graceful and 
elegant plant than the Osmunda regalis when grown on the 
OSMUNDA REG A LIS.

Though easily cultivated 
it is several years before it recovers itself after being transplanted.
There are a few varieties: â€”

Cristata, Moore.
(Fig. 863.) â€” A remarkably handsome 
form, which accidentally came into the possession of Messrs.
Osborn and Sons, of Fulham, and by them distributed.
Length 
three feet, width two feet, broadly ovate in form, bipinnate, 
the rachis being furcate, and the apex multifid crisped.
The 
apices of the pinnae dilated into a large, spreading, crispy, 
fan-shaped tuft, and the apices of the pinnules also dilated 
and multifidly lobed.
My thanks are due to Messrs.
Osborn 
for a plant presented to me several years ago, and which 
has flourished with me to such an extent, that, at the British 
Association Floral Fete, in August, 1866, it won the first prize 
as a specimen British Fern, being symmetrical in form, and 
fourteen feet in circumference.
Interrupta, Moore.
â€” In the possession of INIr. Sim, of Foot's 
Cray.
Differing in having a few normal pinn;r, and the rest 
reduced in size, and of a roundish flabcllatc form.
