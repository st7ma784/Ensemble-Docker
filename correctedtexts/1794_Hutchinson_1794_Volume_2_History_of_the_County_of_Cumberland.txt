HISTORY OF CUMBERLAND.
THE PARISH OF HALE, 
(in ALLERDALE ward above DERWENT) 
HIGH, as a member of Egremont, was granted out by the lord of that 
vv barony to the Multons of Gilfland.
In the time of King Henry III.
wc 
find it gave name to a refident family, whofe defcendants appear to have held it 
of Thomas de Multon in the reign of King Edward I.
It came afterwards to the 
family of Ponfonby, by marriage.
The anccftor of the Ponfonbies came into 
England with the conqueror, and was of Picardy.
The family of Befborough, in 
Ireland, is derived from this ftock.
There feems to be great confufion in the 
defcent of thefe proprietors, for fome of them took the name of De Hale, and it 
is not eafy from that caufe, to give their fucceflion here with accuracy.
" Hale, in Henry III.’s time, was the land of Alexander de Hale, Agnes and 
“ Conftance, his daughters, held it 23d Edward I.
of Thomas Multon of Gilfland, 
“ but in Edward II.
’s time, he is named Chriftian in John Multon’s office.
The 
Ponfonbies got Agnes’ part, and in Richard II.
’s time, William Beauchamp, 
“ Robert Harrington, in Everington, Richard Murthing, and John Stanley, the 
“ other part ; but now Ponfonby holds it wholly.”t 
The church of Hale was appropriated to the priory of Conifhead, in the year 
1345, Archdeacon of Richmond, referving a penfion of 6s.

etymologies as might ferve to elucidate.

TO THE EDITORS OF THE HI STORE OF CUMBERLAND.
GENTLEMEN, 
I am forry to find, that your account of Beckermont is printed off; 
becaufe it was there that the Poem which I now fend you fliould, mofi: properly, 
have come in.
As, however, both the place and the fubjedl of it have fome con- 
nexion with the adjoining parifh of Hale, I agree with your printer, that it may 
take its place, without injury either to the poem or your readers, in the beginning 
of your next volume.
There is fomething, in my efiimation, fo fingular and ftriking in the hifiory of 
this little production, that you owe it to your readers, and perhaps to the author 
alfo, to give them fome account of it.
The whole owes its birth entirely to that 
little fimple mention of IVotobank communicated in the fcrap of paper which 
you fome time ago put into my hands; and which 1 requeft you to print, verbatim,, 
at the end of the poem.
When I firfl; read this little village anecdote, brief and 
artlefs as it is, there feemed to be fome fuch genuine ftrokes of nature in it, that, 
happening to have an opportunity, I could not help remarking to a poetical friend, 
that it was a fine fubjecS for a poem.
My friend was fo touched with it, that, 
fnatching up her pen, flie immediately fketched the outlines, and ftruck off 
mofi: of the parts, of this exquifitely curious piece of poetry.
A more ftriking 
infiance of the creative powers of genius never occurred to my obfervation.
And if your readers in general find in it, as they indubitably will, defcriptions 
highly poetical ; numbers charmingly harmonious ; infinite pathos, and much 
appropriated charadler, they will be the lefs furprifed, when you inform them 
that this is an, hafiy indeed, but elegant, effufion of the mufe of Mrs. Cowley.
Of this lady’s great powers to pleafe, in other departments of literature, the 
world needs not that you fliould inform them : but, perhaps, it may have been 
referved for you, firff, to have an opportunity of fhewing that fhe who has pre- 
fumed, not raflily, to emulate Terence and Congreve, has alfo fair and well- 
founded pretenfions to vie with Ovid and Hammond.
And I cannot but think 
it a very flattering compliment to our county, that one who has fo often delighted 
and improved the world at large, by her dramatic compofitions, has now con- 
defcended to add fuch an embellifhment to our county hifiory.
1 have the honour to be, 
EPSOM, Gentlemen, &c.

A POEM.
SkIDDAW!
I climb thy high uplifted form.
Dare thy bold fteep, and foar above the ftorm ; 
Below my feet fee the keen light’nings ftart, 
Which, midfl the nether region harmlefs dart; — 
Or, through the clouds that roll their feas away.
Thy proflrate villages, and lakes furvey; 
Mark, where tranfparent Derwent fpreads its tide.
On the fmooth pebbles which it fcorns to hide: 
Hang with delight o’er Keswick’s foften’d glades.
Behind whofe Ihadowy oaks the day beam fades; 
Here, fling my glance acrofs the tangley dells, 
’There, reft it on the mifty, diftant FELLS — 
In the vajl Painting own the hand divine.
And fee in every touch the Godhead’s pencil shine.
But chiefly Ennersdale to thee I turn.
And o’er thy healthful vales heart-rended mourn!
Vain do thy riv’lets fpiead their curving fides, 
Whilft o’er thy glens the fummer zephyr glides; 
Vain are thofe guardian woods which {hade thy plains.
And fhelter Nature’s wild, yet foothing drains — 
For ah !
thofe plains, thofe vales, thofe fhelt’ring woods, 
Nourilh’d by Bassanthw aite’s contiguous floods, 
Once witnefs’d fuch a fad and heavy deed.
As makes the aching memory recede.
For this, thy flowers each foft returning morn 
Drop their clear tears; for this the fnowy thorn 
Prefents its point to Philomela’s bread, f 
And bids it rob thy flumb’ring maids of reft; 
For this, that time-worn Yew its branches bends.
And to the fcene a deeper fadnefs lends; 
Midft Lorton’s vale its wond’rous Items arife.
Unmatch'd, beneath our floating ar£tic Ikies — 
f It is popular tradition, that the Nightingale refts her hofom on a thorn, and endures its foft pundlure whilft flic 
dugs; — thus exciting in bcrfelf thofe melancholy and piercing notes, fo dear to Poetry : — 
“ Oh !
for a prick now, like a Nightingale, 
“To put my t)r^;aft againft.”

EDWINA.
Planted by Henry in an anguifh’d day, 
And on its roots, his head full oft in forrow lay.
Yes !
— I will tune the ftory to my lyre, 
Nor alk •^our aid, ye Nymphs who breathe in fiie ; 
Parnassus and its long fi£titious train, 
I never call’d on to adorn my ftrain — 
Puerile invention of the early mind, 
Ere reafon grew, ere knowledge was refin’d.
Dim lights y which fix ft on Grecian darknefs gleam’d.
And midft its polijh'd ignorance faintly beam’d — 
Then, fwift defcended to the Roman bands.
And flafh’d, beneath their arms, o’er diftant lands: 
I call not you!
— your radiant fields I fhun.
Nor o’er your gay deceptions raptur’d run — 
Vani/b!
each cheering profpe£l from my view.
Let weeds fpring up, and hemlock fling its dew; 
Let the lorn owl labour his grating fong.
And be the north wind’s fhriekings loud, and long ; 
fThefe flrall Infpire my hand to touch the chord.
Which trembles to the woes of Ennersd ale’s once Lord!
He, the foie heir of Atheling was known, 
Whofe bloody ftern Scotland I midft thy heaths has flown.
Not five and twenty fummers o’er his head 
Had led their oibs, when he prepar’d to wed 
The fweet EDWINA.
Blooming were the charms 
Which her fond father gave to Henry’s arms.
Long had he woo’d the charming bajlsful maid.
Who, yet to liften to Love’s tales afraid.
By many modeft arts— (fo Love ordains) 
Increas’d his pafiion, though increas’d his pains.
At length the Nuptial Morn burft from the fky, 
Bidding prifmatic light before her fly ; 
Soft purple radiance ftream’d around her car, 
Abforbing all the beams of every ftar ; — 
Rofes awaken’d as fhe pafs’d along.
And the high lark perform’d his foaiing fong, 
Whilft pinks their fragrance fhaking on the air.
The proud carnation’s glories feem’d to fhare ; 
The 
EDWINA.
1 
The breezes fnatch’d their odours as they flew, 
And gave them in return pellucid dew.
Which fed their colours to a higher tone.
Till all the earth, A vegetative rainbow shone.
Beneath her hufband’s roof the matchlefs fair 
Graced each delight, and each domeflic care.
Her plaftic needle bade frefh flow’rets blow.
And, hung in rich feftoons, around her glow ; 
In cooling grots her Jhell-iuork feiz’d the eye.
With {kill arrang’d to fhew each melting dye; 
Her tafte, the garden ev’ry where fuflain’d.
In each parterre her vivid fancy reign’d.
Submlflive tews in folid walls fhc form’d.
Or bade them rife a caflle, yet uniform’d ; 
In box the eagle hover’d o’er its neft.
Or feem’d a couchant lion, funk to reft.
Her hufband’s fports his lov’d Edwina lhared.
For her the hawking party was prepared ; 
She roufed the wolf — the foaming boar fhe chaced* 
And Danger’s felf, was in her prefence graced.
O, Marriage !
powerful charm — Gift, all divine!
Sent from the fkies o’er Life’s fad wafte to ftiine.
What fplendors from thy bright Tiara fpring.
What graces to thy decent footfteps cling.
Vengeance will furely hail that ideot land 
Which drags the feeptre from thy hallow’d hand — 
Which, wanton I tramples on thy holy rites.
And nuptial perfidy, unawed.
Invites : 
The weeping world to thee its folace owes.
From thee derives its trueft, beft, repofe !
Not the cold compadf fubtle Interest twines.
Not that, which pale Submission trembling figus, 
Is Marriage I No — ’tls when its polifn’d chain 
Binds thofe who in each other’s 'oofom reign ; 
’Tis when two minds form one extatic whole.
One fw'eetly blended wifti, one fenfe, one foul.
This was the gift the exiled feraph curft.
When from hell’s blazing continent he bur ft; — 
Eeten’s 
s 
EDWINA.
Eden’s full charms he faw without » groan, 
Though Nature there had fix’d her gorgeous throne.
Its rich Ananas, and its Aloes high, 
Whofe forms pyramidal approach the Iky ; 
Its tow’ring palms with lufcious clufters crown’d.
Its fhrubs, whofe perfumes fill’d the region round; 
Its dreams dlaphonous, its bowers of (hade.
Its flowers that knew to bloom, but not to fade ; 
Its Orb which nurfed the new-created day.
Its Bow which joy’d the night with tender ray ; 
Its fields of wavey gold, its flopes of green, 
By the fell fiend -withoMt a pang were feen — 
’Twas then fierce rancour feiz’d the demon’s bread, 
When In the Married Pair he felt mankind were blefi.
Thus roll’d two years on flow’ry wheels along, 
’Midd calm domedic blifs, and fport, and fong.
O, Edgar !
from pernicious Gallia’s fhore, 
Hadd thou, immoral youth!
return’d no more.
Such years thro’ lengthen’d time had fweetly run, 
Down to the fainted beams of Life’s lad fun.
But thou returnd’d I and thy voluptuous heart.
Which from temptation never knew to dart.
Seized on Edwina as a lawful prize — 
All dead to Honour’s voice, and Confcience’ fecret cries.
Edgar, to Ennersdale oft bent his way, 
H Is form was courtly, and his manners gay; 
To Henry he would fpeak of wars he’d feen.
Of tournaments, and gaudes, midd peace ferene.
When for Edwina’s ear the tale was fram’d.
The beauties of bright Gallia’s court were nam’d.
Their lives, their loves, all pad before her view.
And many things were feign’d he never knew.
' , 
At length the prudent fair remark’d the file, 
And faw beneath his eafe, didorted guile ; — 
For virtue in his tales ne’er found a place.
Nor maiden vigilance, nor matron grace.
But wild and loofe his glowing dories ran.
And thus betray’d the black defigning man.
As 
EDWINA.
As when, in eaftern dimes, midft hours of play, 
A fweet boy (wand’ring at the clofe of day, 
Along the margin of a gadding ftream, 
Whilfk Hope around him throws her fairy dream) 
Sudden beholds the panther’s deadly eye.
And turns, by impulfe ftrong, his ftep to fly — 
So turn’d Edwina, when (he faw, reveal’d.
The net th’ enfaring youth had hoped conceal’d : 
Whenever he appear’d her air grew cold.
And awed to mute defpair, this Baron boldi 
He by degrees forbore to feek her gate.
Who fat enflirined within, in Virtue’s ftate : 
But his wild wiflies did not ceafe to rage, 
Nor did he ftrive their fever to afluage — 
For linful love is ever dear to sin.
Its vidfims, felf-corre£lion ne’er begin ; 
But hurried on by hell, purfue their road.
Nor heed furrounding woes, nor tremble at their God!
The huntfman blew the horn, ere liftlefs day.
Had from his fhoulder thrown his robe of gray.
Ere he had fhaken from his fhining hair.
The rofy mills which irrigate the air.
Lord Henrt heard — and from his pillow fprung.
And bold refponfive notes he cheerly fung ; 
Then, “ wake, my love !” the happy hulband cried, 
To her, who, fweetly flumb’ring at his fide, 
Wifh’d Hill, thus Jlumbering to wear the morn.
And almoft chid the early tyrant horn — 
Yet quick ftie rofe, and quick her bufy maids.
Folding her yellow locks in carelefs braids, 
Equip’d her for the field — fweeping (he flew.
Like a Aim arrow from the graceful yew.
Her jet black Heed more lively feem’d to bound.
When the light burden on his back he found — 
The jet black fteed her hulband had bellow’d.
When firll, a huntrefs, at his fide Ihe rode ; 
Long was his ftreaming mane, his eye of fire.
Proved his defeent from no ignoble fire; 
He fprung ’midll Araby’s far diftant plains, 
Whofe fands the bleeding vi’let never llains.

EDWINA.
And now the day in all his glories dreft.
Seem’d at the bugle’s call to (hake off reft.
He pour’d his beams around in ample floods 
Rivers of light defcended on the woods ; 
The plains, the vallies drank the radiant fliower.
Each plant received it, and each gentle flower.
,The Hunt infpir’d, the ambient aether rent 
With varied founds, as their keen courfe they bent ; 
The dogs, deep mouth’d, in chorus form’d the cry.
And fent their foreft-greetings to the fky; 
The horn’s full tone fweird each pervading note, 
And harmony and joy around the country float.
At length a boar, thro’ a dark coppice fide, 
Amidft the ruftling buflies feem’d to glide ; 
Cautious he moved, like a fell thief of night.
Strung by his fears to unintended flight.
Clofe to the earth he foftly crept along.
And flirubs, and underwood around him throng » 
But ah !
in vain, he creeps,* the air fo thin, 
Catches th’ effluvia from his reeking flcin.
The titillations to the hounds keen noftrils fly.
Who inftantly the brown receffes try.
When turn’d before them into open view.
Quick tranfport from each ardent bofom flew; 
But huntfman*s law the churning favage found.
They fuffer’d his efcape twelve rood of ground, 
Eie loofe was let the eager mad’ning pack.
To follow in the briftly monfter’s track ; 
At length in clofe purfuit they pour along.
Urged, or retarded by their Leader’s thong.
O’er hills, thro’ brakes, he led them many an hour.
Straining each nerve — exhaufting ev’ry power: 
Now hears the dogs’ faint mouthings far behind.
Then fcents them as around a Beck they wind— — 
With dread and joy alternately is fill’d.
Now high with hope, and now with terror.

Then in defpair he turns to meet the foe.

His ftruggling breaft convulfive motions ftrain, 
His fpouting veins the foaming courfers (lain : 
The death-notes iflue from the brazen horn.
And from th’ enormous trunk, the head is torn.
Straight with the tufk-arm’d head upon his fpear, 
Lord Henry turn’d to her — for ever dear!
To lay the bleeding trophy at her feet, 
And make his triumph more fincerely fweet 
But horror I — no Ed wina could be feen.
Nor on the hill’s foft Hope, or pafture green j 
Not Ihelter’d, near the torrent’s fall (he lay.
Nor on the foreft’s edge, efcaped the day.
Nor was fhe on the plain —the vallies too.
Gave no Edwina to the aching view.
Wonder and dread tomprefs her hufband’s heart.
O’er the furrounding fcene his eye-beams dart ; 
He moves ftands ftill terror lifts up his hair.
He fcems the pale-cheek’d fpe£l:re of defpair.
And now was heard her Heed’s fonorous neigh, 
Whofe voice the rocks firm echoes would obey } 
Bounding, he comes towards them from the plain, 
But his fweet miftrefs, held no guiding rein — - 
The reins float loofely as he cleft the air.
No miftrefs fweet, with guiding hand was there !
From all but Henry burft ten-ific cries.
Silent his dread — and quite fupprefs’d his fighs.
His manly features fink, his eye-lids clofe.
And all his lineaments exprefs his woes.
Speech 1 O, how weak, when mighty forrows fpring, 
When fears excejfive to the bofom cling I 
Words may to lighter troubles give a (hew.
But find no place where griefs tranfcendent grow.
At length they each, a different way diverge.
Some to the mountain’s haughty brow emerge.
Others purfue the plain — the wood — the dell.
Appointing where to meet, their fortune drear, to tell.
And now, O!

12 
EDWINA.
A road fuccin£l:, Edwina meant to take, 
And pufh’d her deed acrofs an ancient brake ; 
Butin the thicket tangled and difmay’d.
And of the thorny folitude afraid.
Again flie turn’d her horfe — ah !
turn’d in vain.
She mifs’d the op’ning to the neighbour plain.
At length difmounting, tremblingly flie drove.
To force a path, through briars thickly wove ; 
The horfe releas’d, draight vanilh’d from her eye.
And o’er oppofing brambles feem’d to fly — ^ — 
The didant hounds his prick’d-up ears invade.
And quick he Ikims o’er ev’ry glen, and glade.
Jdis midrefs, thus forfook, with prickles torn.
And weeping oft with pain, and all forlorn.
At length atchiev’d a path, and faw a rill.
To which die mov’d, her ruby mouth to fill; — 
Her taper’d hand immers’d beneath the dream, 
Flafli’d through the glalTy wave with pearly gleam.
It bore the living moidure to her lips.
And eagerly the panting beauty fips.
The diining freflinefs o’er her brow die threw.
And blefs’d the current as it fparkling flew ; 
Then on its borders fought a diort repofe, 
Whild round her, doddergrafs, and panftes rofe.
Sleep foon, unhidden^ caught her in his fnare,.
And folded in his arms the weaiy fair.
Two afpin trees in one fmooth bark were bound.
And threw a thin and trembling diadow round.
The waters gently tinkled as they fell.
And a near dieep fudain’d a filv’ry bell, 
Whild bree7es o’er her temples foftly dray’d.
And ’midd her floating ringlets, leaping, play’d.
Who would not widi to linger in fuch red.
Where •waters, Jhades, and founds, make deeping bled ?
But Powers sublime !
who tread the burning air.
And give to fainted chadity your care.
Where roved ye now?
— Where waved your filmy wlng»^ 
Where druck your harps their million beamy drings?
If on Light’s rays, fwift (hot from pole to pole.
Your Essences fupine you chofe to roll, 
EDWlNx\.
Or the rich glowing tapeftry to weave.
Which rauft the fun’s retiring Orb receive.
Yet ftill you fliould have left each talk undone.
Fled from the glowing well — forfook the fun, 
Rulh’d in whole troops, nor left one fylph behind.
And all your cares to Ennersdale confin’d i 
Clung round the afpins where Ed wina flept.
And o’er her form, your anxious vigils kept — 
Whofe numbers, long fpun out their rofy dreams, 
And ftill confoled her midft the noontide beams.
When a hard grafp which fciz’d her liftlefs hands.
Rude, fnapt afunder their narcotic bands.
She ftarted, and Ihc found, — O !
hated fight, 
Clofe at her fide the am’rous, villain knight.
Who tried in fpecious terms his hopes to paint — • 
Infpir’d by ev’ry fiend, he call’d on ts'xjjfcunt !
Surprife, at firft, held mute Edwina’s tongue, 
And many changes on his theme he rung.
Ere Ihe could pour her chafte, her proud, difdain, 
Or check with cold contempt his odious ftrain.
At length fhe fpoke.
So once, Judean Fair !
Thou turn’d’ft upon the fober, hoary pair 
Who flunk, with wanton thoughts and afpeiEl: grave.
To watch thee, rifing from the gelid wave.
Infulted Virtue thunder’d from thy tongue, 
And o’er thy eye indignant lightnings hung, 
Swift came the vollied fpeech ; — grand was thy tone.
And Chastity in bright effulgence (hone: 
Around thy iv’ry form dark myrtles grew.
To fnatch thee from the gazing monfters’ view ; 
Through their deep foliage came thy pointed words,.
Thy glance was fire — thy fentences were fwords !
- 
Such were Edwina’s tones, her look, her air.
Striking the young feducer with defpair : 
Yes, youiig he was, in Beauty’s fulleft prime, 
Untarnifh’d yet, untouch’d by with’ring time; 
O’er his red cheek foft dimples playful ran,.
Whilft grace, and finewy ftiength proclaim’d the man;.
His charms^ his pajfton^ fweet Edwina fpurn’d.
And with unfeign’d abhorrence, ftately turn’d ; 
Then 
EDWINA.
Then walk’d with mien compos’d acrofs the moor.
Though tremblings feiz’d her heart, and doubtings fore ; 
But Edgar foon ftie heard, ftep quick behind.
And then to mad’ning fears her foul refign’d.
, 
She feem’d to borrow from the wind its wings, 
When from its fouthern poital firfl; it fprings 
Flying, as borne upon the billowy air, 
Urged by diftradion on, and black defpair.
Her bafe purfuer fpurr’d by dire intent.
Kept clofcly In the track the fair one went ; 
Nor hurried much, but thought her failing feet.
Would foon retard a courfe fo wondrous fleet, 
He thought aright, and in his felon arms, 
Prefs’d Henry’s beauteous wife, half ivild with dread alarms.
Scarce had he dared to grafp her finking frame.
When with the quicknefs of devouring flame, 
A furious wolf from out the bord’ring wood 
With eyes all glaring near Edwina ftood 
The brindled hair rofe ftiflF upon his chine.
Of ghallly, death-full joy, the horrid fign ; 
His clinging fides confefs’d his famifh’d (late.
And his deep howl proclaim’d a vi£lim’s fate.
The coward fled !
— O !
now my pen forbear, 
Nor with the fhrieks of terror rend the air !
The wolf’s fell teeth — but oh !
I check the fong.
Nor can the horrid, agonizing chord prolong.
The favage ftarting from his bleeding prey, 
Rufli’d to his haunt, and briefly fled awayj 
Approaching Heps declared fwift danger nigh.
And forced — too late!
th’ unglutted beaft to fly.
Thofe fteps were HenS.y’^s I — he firft reach’d the fpot.
For HIM to reach it, was the dreadful lot !
He faw her marble bofom torn — her mangled head ; 
He faw — M ysterious fate!
Edwina dead!
Thofe eyes were clofed, whofe rich and beamy light.
Would (bed a luftre on pale Sorrow’s night 
Dumb was that honied mouth, whofe graceful fpeech.
Beyond the fchoolman’s eloquence would reach !
The fnowy arms which lately clafp’d her Lord, 
Now ftreak’d with flowing blood — O !
thought abhorr’d !
Before 
EDWINA.
Before his ftarting eyes, all iifelefs hang, 
And give him mare than death’s, lafl, rending pang.
His cries of agony fpread o’er the plain.
And reach’d the diftant undulating main ; 
His fcreams of anguifli ftruck with terror, more.
Than the lank wolf’s mofl defolating roar.
Vain his attendants footh — in vain they pray.
In ftormy grief he wearied down the day.
A furious maniac, now he raged around.
And tore the bufhes from th’ embracing ground, 
Then fpent, all prone upon the earth he fell.
And from his eyes the guftiing torrents fwell.
When SORROW could articulate its grief.
When ‘Words allow’d a tranfient ftiort relief, 
“Woe to thee Bank!” were the firft founds that burft, 
“ And be thy foil with bitter offspring curft !
“ Woe to thee Bank !
for thou art drunk with gore.
The pureft, heart of woman ever bore I” 
Woe to thee Bank I th’ attendants echoed round.
And pitying fhepherds caught- the grief-fraught found.
Thus, to this hour, through ev’ry changing age.
Through ev’ry year’s, ftill, ever varying ftage.
The name remains; and Woe-to-Bank is feen.
From ev’ry mountain bleak, and valley green — 
Dim Skiddaw views it from its monftrous height, 
And eagles mark it, in their dizzy flight; 
The Bassenthwaite’s foft murmurs forrow round, 
And rocks of Buttermere proteft the ground, 
Foamy Helvellyn raging in his fall.
Seems on Lo core’s rough fympathy to call— 
From peak to peak they widly bur ft away.
And form with rufhing tone, a hollow, dirge-like lay.
Not Rocks, and Cataracts, and Alps alone, 
Point out the fpot, and make its horrors known.
For faithful lads ne’er pafs, nor tender maid.
But the foft rite of tears is duly paid ; 
Each can the ftory to the trav’ler tell.
And on the fad difafter, pitying dwell — 
Thus Woe-To-Bank thou’rt known thy fwains among.
And now thou liv’ft within an humble stranger’s fong!

( IN ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT.

W E approached Egremont in a ferene evening, which made it appear to 
great advantage at a diftance.
This is a clean little town, fituated on the north fide of the river End, and con- 
fiding chiefly of one long ftreet ; much of the countenance of antiquity is retained, 
feveral of the houfes are piazzaed in front: there are indeed fome new buildings 
in a modern ftile, but they are in the fkirts of the towm.
The place is juflly 
efteemed pleafant, being furrounded with good lands, the inclofures, in general,, 
well fenced, and the meadows productive.

The ruins of Egremont Caftle ftand on an eminence to the weft of the towm.
This fortrefs is not of very great extent, but bears fingular marks of antiquity and 
ftrength.
The approach and grand entrance from the fouth, has been kept by a 
draw- bridge over a deep moat ; the entrance to the caftle, is by a gateway vaulted 
with femicircular arches, and guarded by a ftrong tower: the architeeflure of this 
tower, which is the chief part of the fortrefs now ftanding, points out its antiquity 
to be coequal to the entry of the Normans at leaft.
The outward wall has inclofed 
a confiderable area of a fquare form, but it is now gone fo much to decay, that no 
probable conjeefture can be made in what particular manner it was fortified.
On 
the fide next the town a poftern is remaining.
To the weft ward, from the area,’ 
there is an afeent to three narrow’ gates, ftanding clofe together and in a ftraight 
line, v\hich have communicated with the outworks : thefe are apparantly of more 
modern architediure, and have each been defended with a portcullis.
Beyond 
thefe gates is a lofty mount, on which anciently flood a circular tower, the w'eftern 
fide of which endured the rage of time till within thefe few years.
This mount 
is artificial, and in height feventy-eight perpendicular feet above the ditch, which 
furrounds the whole fortrefs.
Jt is not improbable but this tower was ereded on 
the crown of a Danifh fort ; for fuch is the appearance of the mount.
The whole 
f:rtification is furrounded with a moat, more properly fo called than a ditch, as 
it appears to have been walled on both fides ; this is ftrengthened with an out- 
ward rampier of earth, which is five hundred paces in circumference.
A fmall 
brook runs on the caftern fide of the caftle, and it may be prefumed, anciently 
filled the moat.
The mode of building which appears in part of the walls, is 
rather uncommon, the conftrudion being of large thin ftones, placed inclining.

As was obferved before, William the conqueror having pofTeffed himfelf of this 
part of the country, gave it to his attendant, Ranulph de Mefchines, who, with 
a fufficient armed power, was bound to defend and maintain the fame : fuch aCts 
were ftrong indications of conqueft, and not concefTion ; fome, and with a degree 
of juftice, deny the appellation of conqueror to this prince.
In order to keep the 
province in fubjeCfion, it was the policy of this fovereign, to grant to fome of his 
retainers the baronial authority there, with pow'er to diftribute in fmaller members 
the whole territory, to be holden under him as chief lord.
Whoever looks into our 
old law books, will fee, that under military fervice, and the feodal tenures, this 
was an indifpenfable appointment, and not an acl of tyranny, or the fevere law of 
a conqueror.
The Rate of the Norman laws, and ordonances then introduced to this 
country, was no otherwife difeordant to the Saxon inftitutions, than that it put 
the feveral diflriCts under a new fpecies of magiftracy, and rendered unneceffary 
the decennaries and other fureties of the peace of each petty Rate, by delegating 
an authority to lords of manors, for governing the refidents within their refpeCtive 
jurifdidlions, agreeably to the common law, or law of the people.
When Ra- 
nulph granted out to his feveral retainers, their refpeClive allotments, he referved

the great barony of Copeland, bounded by the rivers Dudden, Derwent, and the

He married Alicia Maria, 
daughter of George Lord Carpenter, and by her had iffue George Earl of 
Egremont, the prefent pofleffor; who was born A.
D. 1751.
This was an ancient borough, disfranchifed at its own petition, as it is faid, to 
avoid the expence of reprefentation in parliament.
The burgeffes poffeffed feveral 
privileges, but of thole all records are lofl: ; what they wxre in an inland fituation, 
is not cafy to conjedure, fave only an exclufive trade.
The ordonances of 
Richaid Lucy, for the government of the borough, made about the time of King 
John, are to the following effed : — “ Sciant, &c.

In this curious record feveral fingularities are to obferved, which point out to 
us the cuftoms of that diftant age: by this burgage tenure the people of Egremont 
were obliged to find armed men for the defence of the fortrefs, forty days at their 
own charge.
The lord was entitled to forty days credit for goods, and no more; 
and his burgefles might refufe to fupply him, till the debt which had exceeded that 
date was paid.
They were bound to aids for the redemption of the lord and his 
heir from captivity, for the knighthood of one of the lord’s fons, and the marriage 
of one of his daughters.
They were to find him twelve men for his military- 
array.
They were to hold w^atch and ward.
They could not enter the foreft with 
bow and arrow'.
They were reftrained from cutting off their dogs feet w ithin the 
borough, as being a necelTary and cuftomary defence : on the borders, the dogs 
appointed to be kept for defence were called Jlough dogs: this reftrieftion points 
out, that within the limits of forefts, the inhabitants keeping dogs for defence were 
to lop off one foot or more, to prevent their chacing the game; which did not 
fpoil them for the defence of a dw’elling.
A fingular privilege appears in the cafe 
of a burgefs committing fornication with the daughter of a ruftic, one who was not 
a burgefs, that he fttould not be liable to the fine impofed in other cafes for 
that offence, unlefs he had feduced by promife of marriage.
The fine for feducing 
a w’oman belonging to the borough was 3s.
to the lord.
By the rule for infpeefting 
the dyers, weavers, and fullers, it feems thofe were the only trades at that time 
within the borough under the character of craftfmen The burgeffes w ho had 
ploughs were to till the lord’s demefne one day in the year, and every burgefs to 
find a reaper : their labour was from morning, ad nonam; which was three o’clock, 
as from fix to three.
The ancient cuftom of eledling a chief magiftrate is preferved here.
The town 
is governed by a ferjeant and a jury.
On the adjoining common we obferved feveral 
tumuli, particulai ly one of loofe ftones, forty paces in circumference : not far from 
it is a circle of large ftones, ten in number, forming an area of fixty paces in cir- 
cumference, w ithout any elevation of ground.
The church of Egremont was given by William de Mefehines to the cell of 
St. Bees, appertaining to St. Mary’s in York ; it continues to pay a penfion of

THE PARISH OF CLEATOR 
{ IN ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT.
) 
I S the next towards the north : it is divided from Egrernont by Kekell-beck.* 
This manor has been long infranchifed.
In an inquifitiqn of knights fees in 
Cumberland, taken in the 35th year of King Henry VIII.
it appears.
that the ten- 
ants held of the king in capite, as of his caflle of Egrernont, by a ninth part of a 
knight’s fee, and i2d.
fea-wake.
“ Kekell runneth from of Whilley More by Cleter and Egrernont, and fo into 
“ Eyn at Egrernont.
Egre is the foot of Eyn, which falleth out of Eynardale.
— 
“ Alnanderdale is that which is now called Eynerdale, a town and chapelry in the 
“ fells above Egrernont.
To the priory and abbey of St. Mary’s, in York, Waldeof, 
“ as Lord of Allerdale, fon of Earl Gofpatrick, gave Stainburn, that prayers fhould 
" be fail!
there for the fouls and health of King Henry I.
Matilda his wife, the 
“ donor, his wife, children, ancellors, and fucccffors.
The charter made by 
“ rhurlfan, Archbifliop of York, &c.
“ Eynerdale, yrt///V ad Eyn^ both the town and parifh, now fo called by the 
“ inhabitants.
The Irifh named it Lough-Eauheli, Lacus Volucrum^ of the fowls 
* “ that bred there in the iflands,f and the river Oonh-Eanheli, and the dale Eaner or 
“ Areqn.
The Saxons, ftill retaining the Irifli name, called the bottom and valley 
* Said to be anciently called the Kekell-terr, corrupted to Cleator.
f This is a confiderable lake of water, but little vifited, and in no wife remarkable for natural curlo- 
fities or beauty : like other tarns or Handing waters, wild fowl breed in, and haunt the brakes and 
rulhcs.
Extent.] From north to fouth, about three miles ; and from eaH to weft about a mile and a half.
Soil and Produce ] Some fmall parcels of dry light land, but the foil in general has a large pro- 
portion of clay, and naturally cold and wet.
Eittle wheat is grown here, though, with good culture, the 
foil is capable of producing that grain in perfedlion.
— Barley and oats are the chief forts of grain.
— The 
farmers are not induftrious — No turnips are grown.
— Few potatoes ; and no fallow is made.
Common.] This pariih claims an exteniive right to the mountain called Dent, (though Egrernont 
enjoys part of the pafturage) and alfo a fmall parcel of common to the north.
About 700 (Keep are kept, 
of which, on an average, feven fleeces go to the ftone, value 7s 6d.
Cattle, &c.
are nearly fimilar to 
thofe of Egrernont.
Minerals, Coal and Iron Ore ] A great quantity of lime is burnt and exported for Scotland 
during the funimer fenfon, computed at 400 bufhels per day ihipped.
— No freeftone here 
Manufactures.] Two iron forges, one at Wath.
the other at Cleator; both plating forges, and 
each employs about 12 hands, in making fpades, ftiovels, &'c.
Mountains ] Dent, the only eminence of ccnfequence ; a fine ftieep heathT 
Kiver.J Lhcn or Enn bounds the pariih to the fouth ; has trout and fome few falmon.
Roads ] No very public ones 
School ] Not endowed.
Tithes ] Corn, wool, and lamb in kind.
Tenure.] Wholly freehold.
Genfral Appearance ] Being fituated high, and inclining to the fouth, with little wood, greateft 
part is laid down in paftnrage — The buildings are good, inhabitants rich, and roads bad.

ENNERDALE.
Enerdale; it was at the conquefl: demefne land of Copeland in William 
Mefchines’ time, but his brother, Ranulph Mefchines, gave it to the abbey in 
York, and a carucate in Egremont, or, as I think, but fome part of Enerdale, 
for it was Harrington’s part of the demefne of Egremont, in the partition of 
“ John Multon’s three coheirs, and defcended to Boyvils, and to the Grays and 
** Parrs, Marquifs of Dorfet, and now to Queen Elizabeth, as an efcheat, for want 
“ of ifllie of Parr.”;}; 
At a place called Crozvgarih, in this parifh, is the moft Angular mine of iron 
ore fuppofed to be in Great Britain.
— It lies in the e^rth at the depth of twelve 
fathoms, and the thicknefs of the band of ore, which is hard folid metal, is between 
twenty-four and twenty-five feet.
It was never known to be much wrought till 
the years 1784 and 1785, when it was more generally opened ; and fo great was 
the demand for it at Carron founderyy in Scotland, and others, that, in 1 790 and 
1791, the annual exportation was twenty thoufand tons and upwards.
It is faid 
copper ore may be got about two hundred yards to the eaftward f 
The church is dedicated to St. Leonard, was redlorial, but being given to the 
abbey of Calder, was foon after made appropriate, and is now a curacy only ; the 
licenfes exprefling, “ to ferve the cure of fouls in the chapel of St. Leonard de 
Cleator.” It was certified at 61 .

was, patron and impropriator.
ENNERDALE 
Has parochial privilege, but the church is only a chapel under the mother church 
of St. Bees, efiablifhed by a verdid; in the year 1690.
Ranulph, Ton of William de Mefchines, granted a portion of the manor of Enner- 
dale to the priory of St. Bees, as appears by one of the chartularies of that houfe ; 
the refidue continued in the family of Multon, and, defcending to the Boyvils and 
Grays, was part of the poflefiions of Henry, father of Lady Jane Gray, which, on 
his attainder, efcheated to the crown.
There is a foreft within this manor, which 
formerly was flocked with red deer.
We are informed that the whole flill con- 
tinues in the crown.
At Lozv-Mere becky in the townflflp of Kinnifide, a lead mine was opened in the 
vear 1791.
— It w'as firfl difeovered in the apertures of the fhaken rocks, and, at 
iirfl working had a very promifing appearance, the metal being good, and the 
lituation convenient; but by the negligence or unfleilfulnefs of the workmen, the 
vein was lofl, and the undertaking given up after a fliort trial.
Slates are generally ufed in this country for roofing houfes.
About a mile 
north of the chapel of Ulpha is a flate quarry.
The workings are carried on by 
a perpendicular excavation of a hill of folid rock, at an equal breadth of thirty-five 
Denton’s MS.
We acknowledge our obligations to Mr, IfaacTyfon for much information,— The Editors.

W E* approached the remains of The MONASTERY of St. BEES, fituated 
in a narrow dell, with low and marfhy lands to the eafl; ; the weft expofed 
to ftorms from the Irifh channel.
The monafteries of the fouthern part of Cum- 
berland, and the vale of Nightfhade, in Furnefs, are fituated the worft of any wc 
have vifited, and the fituations are greatly fimilar to each other.
" The church of St. Begh, J was anciently a parifh church, ereefted and dedi- 
” cated in honour of an Irifh woman (named by fome writers Begogh) fometime 
“ there, of great fanCtimony ; whereupon the town was firft called Kirkby- 
“ Begogh, /.
e. villa five habitatio ad Fanum Begae, and by that name of Kirkby- 
Begogh, the church, redlory, and town (containing then feven great carucates 
of land) were given to the Abbey of St. Maries at York, by William de Mefchi- 
nes, then Lord of Egremont barony, and by him made a cell of- York abbey; 
“ he alfo laid the firft foundation of the priory, and that church which now ftand- 
“ eth, and endowed it : and his brother, Randolph Mefehines, gave lands in An- 
“ nerdale, or Annanderdale, and half a carucate of land in Egremont, and other 
“ nobles, barons, and gentlemen of the county, did afterwards contribute unto the 
*' fame, till it became of a fmall foundation, a priory of a good revenue, able to 
fupport a prior and fix monks there at all times, and to defray all charges of 
“ building and other neceflaries of the houfe, yet always as a cell of York, until it 
“ was dilTolved by King Henry VIII.
The name Begogh is Irifh, derived of two 
“ words, Beg-og, which, by interpretation, are Engliihed, little, young.
“ The bounders of William Mefehines aforefaid, which he gave the priory, are

The eaft limb of the church is unroofed and in ruins, having no lingular marks 
of former elegance, but where the communion table was placed.
The whole 
edifice forms a crofs ; the nave is ufed as the parilh church, and the crofs aile as 
a place of fepulture.
The eaft end of the chancel is lighted by three long narrow 
windows, enriched with double mouldings, and two double pilaffers, with rich 
capitals.
On each fide of the place of the altar, are niches of a Angular form for 
ftatues, covered with pointed arches, relfing on well proportioned round pillars, 
with capitals finely adorned, forming a beautiful canopy.
The whole edifice is

* This now obfcure village had the honour, in 151 9, to give birth to Archhijhop Grindall: whofc life 
was written by the laborious and learned Mr. Strype, in folio, in i7io.-*^Unnoted as this place of his 
nativity was, being, as he himfelf faid of it, “ of all that fhire, the ignoranteft part in religion.” “ It 
“ obtained a great flrare of his tender affedfion and love towards it ; having laboured, not only under 
“ great ignorance, but great oppreflion of covetous landlords, moft of any one part of the realm.
For 
“ the redrtfiing of which, in the month of May, 1563, when he was Biftiop of London, he betook him- 
“ felf to Sir William Cecil, fecretary of ftate, his cordial and conftant friend : difcovering at large to him 
“ the ftate of the place ; and difcourfing and confulting with him about a remedy of the evils it fuffered 
“ under : having often thought, as he faid, to make a general fuit to him for a regard to it ; wdiich, no 
“ queftion, had a good effedt.” 
The intimacy that fubfifted between Grindall and Sandys, as well as the fimilarity of their charadleri 
and fortunes is extraordinary.
§ Sandys was born in the town of St. Bees, where his father was a jufticc 
of peace three or four years before Grindall was born at Henfingham.
They were at fchool, and at the 
univerfity together: Sandys fucceeded Giindall as Bifhop of London, and afterwards as Archbifhop of 
York; in fliort, they paffed thi'ough life, in various fortunes, both of profperity and adverfity, as brothers.
Apofthumous volume of fermons by Sandys, now become fcarce, was publifhed in 1616, which well deferves 
the quaint but expreffive chara'^fer given of It in the preface : “ There is no worke written in this 
“ kinde, wherein men of printipall eftate, or particular callings, may be either more fufficiently informed 
“ to know, or more plainly direfted how to perform their feveral duties ; the fuperior how to governe, 
“ the inferior how to obey ; the mlnifter what to teach, the people what to learn ; how the truth may 
“ be confirmed, falfehood repelled, vice reproved, virtue advanced, and fo the child of God be made a 
“ man wife unto fidvation, and perfedtly enabled unto every good work.”

§ We have, fince this was written, found, that Le Neve differing from Strype, fays, that Archbifhop -Sandys, was born 
in Fumefs Fells, in Lancalhire.
From Weft’s genealogy of the family, in his Antiquities of Furnefs, it appears indifput- 
able, that the archbifliop was of the Lancalhire branch of the Sarnies, or Sandys family.
In the reign of Henry IV.
one 
of them went from the family feat, called Rattenby Cajile, in the Parijh of St. Bees, into Furnefs ; and there became the 
founder of a confiderable family'.
Laying all circumftances together, the probability is, that Edwin Sandys, afterwards 
Archbifhop, was fent to feme relation, ftill reCding at St. Bees, and there educated along with Grindall ; fo that neither 
Strype nor Le Neve, are totally wrong.

“ Branthwaite, 
“ Our Edmund Grindall, as well as his friend, Edwin Sandys, in his tender years, addlAed himfclf to 
“ his ftudies ; and even while he was a child books were his delight and recreation, carrying them about 
“ with him.
Which, as it fheu^ed the pleafaie he took in learning, it fo fell out, once, very fortunately 
“ to him.
For when he was a boy, walking fomewhere in the fields, and having his book in his bofom, 
“ an arrow accidentally came, that light with its point juft in the place where the book was ; which, if 
“ the book had not been there, muft certainly have flain him.” 
“ While he was a boy, going a journey with his father, on foot, after fomc violent rains, God 
“ made ufe of him to fave the old man’s life ; for attempting to go over a rotten bridge (over which their 
“ way lay) the youth perceiving the danger, called fuddeuly to his father, and withal pulled him back 
“ with his hand ; which, as foon as he had done, the bridge, by the force of the waters, prefently broke 
“ down.
And thus, God making him the inllrum.ent of preferving his father from fuch a fudden death, 
“ no queftion, the blefling of his father, accompanied with God’s blcfting, defeended on him.” 
After a fuitable foundation of fchool-learning, he w as fent to Magdalen College in Cambridge, but 
removedfrom thence to Chrift’s, and afterwards to Pembroke Hall; where, having taken his firft degree 
in arts, he was chofen fellow in 1538, and commenced M.
A. in 1541.
In 1549, he became pvefideiit 
of his college ; and being now B.
D. was unanimoully chofen Lady Margaret’s public preacher at Cam.- 
bridge ; as he was alfo one of the four difputants in a theological extraordinary aA, performed that year 
for the entertainment of King Edward’s vifitors.
Thus dillinguiftied in the univerfity, his merit was obferved by Ridley, Bifhop of I.ondon, who made 
liim his chaplain in 1550 ; perhaps, by the recommendation of Bucer, the king’s profeftbr of divinity at 
Cambridge ; who, foon after his removal to London, in a letter to that prelate, ftilcs our divine, “ a per- 
“ fon eminent for his learning and piety.” And thus a door being opened to him into church prefer- 
ments, he rofe by quick advances, flis patron, the bllhop, was fo much pleafed with him, that he de- 
figned for him the firft preferments that ftrould fall; and in 1531, procured him to be made chaplain to 
the king.
July 2d, 1552, he obtained a ftall in Weftminfter Abbey ; which however he rellgned to 
Dr. Bonner, whom he aftei-wards fucceeded in tlie bilhoprick of London In the mean time, there 
being a defign, on the death of Dr. Tuuftall, to divide the rich fee of Durham into two ; Grindall, 
as being a northern man, was nominated into one of them.
•• But a great topping courtier, fays 
“ Strype, put an end to this pious purpofe of fuppiying thole parts, where iguoranee and fuperftition moll 
prevailed, with two bilhops ; for, by his fway, he got the who!* bi.'lioprick difiiilved, and fettled as a 
“ temporal eftate upon himfelf.
’ 
In 1553, he fled fiom the pcrfecutlon under Queen Mary, and was one of the exiks for religion in 
Germany ; where he diligently colledled materials for a martyrulogy, and greatly affifted John Fox in 
compiling his laborious work.
Settling at Stralbuigh, he there made hin.felf inafter of the German 
tongue, that he might preach in German churches.
In the d’lpulci at Frankfort, about a new model of 
government arsd form of worfhip, varying from tlic laft liturgy of King hdward, he Tided with Cox 
and others againft Knox and his followers.
Returning to England, on the accefiion of Queen Elizabeth, 
he was employed, among others, in drawing up the new liturgy, to be piefcnted to the queen's firft par*, 
liament ; and was alfo one of the eight proteftaiit divines, chofen about tliat time to hold a public difpute 
with the pepifh prelates.
His tahnt for preaching was likewife very ferviceable.
and he was generally 
appointed to that duty upon all public occafioiis.
At the fame time he w'as appointed one of the com* 
miffioners in the north, on the royal vifitation for reftoring the fupremacy of the crown, and the Proteftant 
faith and worfhip.
This vifitation alfo extended to Cambridge, where.
Dr Young being removed for 
refufing the oath of fupremacy, from the mafterlhip of Pembroke Hall, Grindall was chofen by the fellows 
to fucceed him, in 1559- 
In the month of July, the fame year, he was nominated ta the bilhoprick of London, vacant by the 
Jepofition of Bonner.
The junAure was critical, and the fate of the church revenues feemed to depend 
•n the event.
An adl of parliament had lately paffed, whereby her majefty was empowered to exchange 
the ancient epifcopal manors and lordfhipsfor tithes and impropriations : a meafure extremely regretted

April 1 5th, 1 564, he took the degr'ee of D D at Cambridge; and the fame year, executed the queen’s 
cxprcl's command, for exafting untformity in the clergy; but he proceeded fa tenderly and flowly, that 
tire arxlrblfhop thought fit to excite and quicken him : whence the Puritans thought him inclined to 
tlrftr par ty.
However, he brought leveral Nonconformifts to comply ; to which- end he publiflied a let- 
ter of Henry Eulliirger, mitrifler of Zurick in Switzerland, to prove the hwfulnefs thereof ; which had a 
very good effect.
The fame year, Oftober 3d, on the celebration of the Emperor Ferdinand’s funeral, he 
preaclied a fermon at St. Paul’s, which was afterwards printed.
In 1567, he executed the queen’s orders, 
in proceeding agaitiil the unlicenfed, prohibited preachers ; but was by fome fo treated with rude language

May the ift, 1570, 
he was tranflatcd to the fee of York.
He owed this promotion to Secretary Cecil, and Archbifhop 
Parker ; who liked his removal from London, as not bemg refolute enough for the government there.
H'lre fame year, he wrote a letter to his patron, Cecil, that Cartwright, the famous Nonconfortnift, might

lie began his metropo- 
lliical vifitation, and took meafures for the better regulation of his courts ; but, the fame year, fell under 
her majcily ’s difpleafuro, by I'eafon of the favour he Ihewed to what w'as called the enercife of propheffma.
As tliis was the moll remarkable Incident in his life, we lhall give the following account of the matter : 
d'hefc pr',phefing< had been ufed for fume time ; the rules whereof were, that the mliiiHers of a particular 
divifion, at a fet time, met together at fome church, and there, each In their order, expounded,, according 
to their abilities, fome portion of feripture allotted to them ; this done, a moderator made his obferva- 
tions on what had been laid, and determined the true fenfe of the text ; a certain time feenig fixed for the 
difpatch of the whole.
The advantage was the impTovement of the clergy, who hereby confiderably 
profited themfelves in the knowledge of the feripture ; but this mifebief enfued that at length there 
happened confufions and dlftmbances at thofe meetings, by an oftentation of fupetior paits in (ome, by 
advancing heterodox opinions, and by an intrulion of fome of the lilenced fepai atifls, who took this op- 
portunity of declaiming againll the liturgy and hierarchy ; and hence,, even fpcaking againll dates and 
particular peifons.
The people alfo, of whom there was always a great conflux as hearers, fell to arguing 
and difputing about religion, and fometimes a layman would lake upon himfelf to fpeak.
In Ihort, the 
prophefyingf degenerated into cenfurings, divllions, and faftioms.
Grit dull laboured to redrefs thefe irregularities by fetting down rules and orders for the mana'^ement 
of thefe exen ifts : however, the queen dill difapproved of them, as feeing probably liow very apt they- 
weie to be abufed She did not like, that the laity fhould negleft their fecular affairs, by repairing toi

** thence to the Skeltons, who married the coheir of Thomas Whiterigg, Lord of 
Little Banton.
At the conqueft, one Gillefby, Gilleby, or rather Gillefbred, 
held 
putes, and perhaps feditions, in the ftate.
And the archbifliop being at court, (he particularly declared 
herfelf offended at the number of preachers, as well as the exercifes, and ordered him to redrefs both ; 
urging, that it was good for the church to have few preachers, — that three or four might fufEce for a 
county, and that the reading of the homilies to the people was fuflScIent.
She therefore required him 
to abridge the number of preachers, and put down the religious exercifes.
This did not a little afflift 
him ; he thought the queen infringed upon his office; to whom, next to herfelf, the higheft truft of the 
church of England was committed ; efpecially as this command was peremptory, and made without 
advifing with him, and that in a matter fo diredlly concerning religion.
He therefore wrote a letter to 
her majefty, declaring that his confcience, for the reafon therein mentioned, would not fuffer him to 
comply with her commands.
This refufal was dated Dec. 20th, 1576.
The queen, therefore, having given him fufficient time to 
confider well his refolution, and he continuing unalterable therein, fhe fent letters next year to the bifhops, 
to forbid all exercifes and prophefyings, and to filence all teachers and preachers not lawfully called, of 
whom there was no fmall number.
The cafe was a trying one; that feme difagreeable and mifehievou* 
confequences refulted from thefe prophefyings, has already been remarked ; and that, poffibly, the arch- 
bifhop was mild to an excefs, and even blameably indulgent to thefe beginnings of thofe popular Innova- 
tions, which foon after overturned all order In the church, and the church Itfelf, Is as much as the utmoll 
rigour could poffibly charge him with ; whilft it mull be acknowledged, that he gave very ftrong, if not 
fufficient reafons, for a continuance of the praftice ; and remonftrated to his fovereign, with becoming 
deference and modefty, though at the fame time, with a firmnefs fuitable to the high charadler with which he 
was Invefted.
The queen was inflexible, not to fay Intolerant ; and fo, our prelate ftill refufing to comply, 
was, with an high hand, ordered to be confined to his houfe, and fequeftered from his jurifdidfion for fix 
tnonths.
At the expiration of this term, the lord treafurer wrote to him about making his fubmiffion ; 
with which, as he ftill refufed to comply, the fequeftration was continued; and ere long, there were thoughts 
of depriving him ; which, however, did not take place.
In 1 579, his confinement was either taken off, 
or elfe he had leave to retire to his houfe at Croydon ; for we find him there confecrating the Blfliop of 
Exeter that year, and the Bifhops of Winchefter, Litchfield, and Coventry, the year following.
This 
part of his commiffion was exercifed by a particular commiffion from the queen ; who, in council, ap- 
pointed two civilians to manage the other affairs of his fee, the two of his nomination being fet afide.
Yet fometimes he had fpecial commands from the queen and council to aft in perfon, and iffued out 
orders in his own name ; and in general was as aftive as he could be, and vigilant in the care of his 
diocefe, as occafion oftered.
The precife time of his being reftored does not appear; but, it is in evidence, 
that the feverity ufed towards him was far from bringing him over.
The fartheft advances he made, were 
only fuch a fubmiffion, as became a dutiful fubjeft to his fovereign.
In 1582, feveral of his proceedings 
ftew, that he was then In full poffeffion of all his metropolitical power ; and in that year he loft his eye- 
fight.
In 1583, finding himfelf under great infirmities by the lofs of his fight, and alfo by the ftone, 
ftrangury and cholic, he refigned his archbifhoprick ; retiring, on a fmall but honourable penfion, to Croy- 
don, where, two months after, viz.
July 6th, 1583, he died, aged 63.
We have no exaft accounts of 
the arguments and reafonings that were employed to obtain leave for the archbifhop to refign ; we know 
only, that the fame requeft, urged with the fame earneftnefs, was denied not long fince to the late Dr.
Pearce, Bifhop of Rochefter.
Archbifhop Grindall was, at his own defire, burled in the chancel of the church at Croydon ; where 
a ftone monument, with his effigy lying at length, is erefted on the fouth fide of the communion table, 
againft the wall ; with a long hiftorical, elaborate, Latin epitaph.
He lived and died unmarried.
His only 
brother, whofe name was Robert, with his wife and only fon, all three died in the fpacc of three weeks, 
in 1 567, leaving behind him four orphan daughters.
Of thefe, Anne, contrary to the wifli of her uncle, 
man led “ William Dacfc, fon of Richard Dacre, gent, who dwelt befide Carlifle;'* this perfon is 
fuppofed to have been of the Gilfland family, and to have been nearly connefted with Leonard Dacre, 
who was attainted for high treafon, and banifhed for being concerned In the affair of Mary, Queen of 
Scots.
The archbilhop had likewife feveral nieces, by his fifter, Elizabeth Woodhall.
He does not 
feem to have amaffed much wealth ; which Is the more admIrable,confidering the large revenues he poffeffed, 
and the length of t.me he enjoyed them in the three fees of London, York, and Canterbury, and all the

Hence came the tenure 
“ to 
time free from the incumbrance of a family.
This, as Fuller obferves, may perhaps be erroneoufly im- 
puted to his being an expenfive man ; but it is more truly to be aferibed to his indifference about worldly 
interefts, and his being unwilling to die guilty of much wealth The little he had was well got, and well 
difpofedof, in benefaftlons to the two univerfitles, and in founding the fchoolat St. Bees.
Sttype, who wrote his life, in order to vindicate him from the calumnies to which the troubles in which 
he was involved expofed him, fcys, that he was much celebrated among his cotemporanes, who beft knew 
him, for his great learning and piety.
From the effigy on his monument, in which his blindnefs is cer- 
talnly deferibed, Strype infers that his face was comely, and his beard long, black, andfomewhat forked, 
and curling.
He was a man of great firmnefs and refolutlon, though of a mild, affable temper, and 
friendly difpofition.
His deportment was courteous and engaging : in his elation, not at all affcdflng 
grandeur or ftate ; humane, indulgent, and liberal.
He Is faid to have excelled as a preacher ; and 
thence, perhaps.
In fome degree, his fuppofed prediledion for preaching and preachers.
That he was 
moderate and mild, and indulgent to the Puritans, more than, as it afterwards appeared, was either 
quite prudent, or they deferved, needs not be denied.
Collier, who will hardly be fulpefted of partiality 
to Innovators In religion, exprefsly vindicates him from the Imputations of Latitudinal lanifm, and indif- 
ference to the peculiar and proper interefts of the church.
In fhort, he appears, upon the whole, well 
to have deferved the glorious charadfer, given of him by one of the firft and greateft men of that, or any 
other age, Lord Bacon, viz.
that he was the gravejl and greateji prelate of the land.
The fchool at St. Bees was not founded In Grindall’s life-time.

in the fcramble for church property among the favourites of the court, a Sir Thomas Chaloner (whp 
appears to have had as little connexion with the place, as any well-founded title to It) obtained the manor, 
reftory, and cell of St. Bees.
The archblfhop left 366I.
13s.
4d.
for building and furnifhing the fchool, 
which was faithfully laid out by his executors, on an acre and a half of ground, given for the purpofe by- 
Thomas Chaloner, Efq.
(fon of Sir Thomas Chaloner) who alfo gave forty loads of coals yearly out of 
his co^ mines there, for the ufe of the fchool ; referving a right of placing two fcholars there, by the 
name of Chaloner’s fcholars.
Sir John Lowther firft began a library, to which Sir Jofeph Wiliiamfon 
added many valuable books : Sir John alfo gave the fchool a benefadtion of 5I.
a-year ; Dr. Lamplugh 
alfo gave It 5I.
a-year ; but Mr. Strype adds, without affigning any grounds for it, that this laft benefaftion 
is fince withdrawn.
He left a provifion alfo for a fellow and two fcholars, to be.eledfed from thofe who 
have been brought up at St. Bees, to Pembroke Hall, now Pembroke College, Cambridge ; and the like, 
on the fame condition, to Queen’s College, Oxford ; together with one fcholarlhip in Magdalen College, 
Cambridge.
Seven men (the Provofts of Queen’s College, Oxford, and the parfons of Egremont, for the time 
being, being alw^ays two of the faid feven) are appointed governors of the laid fchool, and made a corpo- 
ration for ever.
When one dies, the furvivors eledl one in his place, within fix weeks ; and in default of 
fuch eletfion, the Bilhop of Chefter Is from time to time to appoint new governors.
The Provoft of 
Queen’s, for the time being, may, with the advice of the BIflrop of Chefter, make ftatutes for the fchool j 
fo as they be not contrary to the archbllhop’s ftatutes.
The fchoolmafter is obliged to bring up his children In the fear of God, with good learning and good 
manners 
He or Iris uffier ffiall teach his children to fay by heart the catechifm in Engllffi, fet forth by public 
atlthority.
The fchoolmafter ffiall teach them the greater as well as leffer catechifm, fet out by authority (this 
feems to be Alexander Nowell’s catechifm, approved in the fynod, 1562) and no otlier cattchifm, 
except publicly authorifed.
The uffier ffiall teach them the A, B, C, in Engllffi, the Pfalter, and the Book of Common Prayer^ 
And the mafter the fmall Catechifm in Latin, fet out by authority.
The mafter is advifed to teach his fcholars Palingenius, Sedulius and Prudentius : but the arc’ibiftiop.
leaves him at liberty to teach w’hat books he pleafes befides, except the Queen’s Grammar, and the ca- 
techifras before mentioned, which, of courfe, muft be taught.
It is obvious to remark, that there are two ftriking errors in the above ftatutes and rules ; which, as 
they have been common, mark, not aichbiffiop GriadaU’s want of judgment in particular, but the ffiort-

luTid their coals immediately, and leave them to be fold at a more favourable opportunity; a defign fo 
rational and plaufible, that one is at a lofs to guefs, how it could poffibly mifearry, Whilll he was in 
this fituation, Mr. B.^con btcanie acquainted with a fmart widow, who kept a coffee-houfe, whom he 
married.
During 'h.is period too, it fell in his way to have it in his power to render feme effential fer- 
vices to the celebrated hlr.
Richardfon.
Some Dublin bookfellers found means, and had the meannefs, 
vvhll.^ his Sir Charles Grandifon was printing in London, to corrupt one or more of his printers ; and 
obtain copies of h's work, (beet by (heet, immediately as it came from the prefs.
This would have 
enabled them, had not their (Iratagem been fruftrated, to have offered the public a cheap edition of this 
excellent work, at leaft as foon as Mr. Richardfon himfclf could have done.
Mr. Bacon was very 
ir.lirumental in de’^etfhig and debating this deep-laid fcheme of iniquity: and Mr. Richardfon makes 
honc/urable mention of him, in a well-written narrative of the tranfaAion, ufqally annexed to the earlier

WHITEHAVEN.
Whitehaven, or White-Toft Haven, is a creek in the fea, at the north end of 
a great bergh or rifing hill, there, which is wallied with the flood on the weft 
fide, where is a great rock or quarry of white hard ftone, which gives name to 
the village and haven.
A very little rill there falls into the fea, which makes the 
“ harbour, where fmall barks may enter and be defended by the hill from the tem- 
“ pefts and winds.
It was belonging to St. Beghs of antient time, for the Abbot 
“ of York, in Edward Ts. time, was impleaded for wreck, and his liberties there, 
by the king, which he claimed from the foundation, to be confirmed by Richard 
Lucy, in King John’s time, to his predeceflbrs.”t Denton’s MS.
About half a mile north of the town, near the road, in an inclofure on the right 
hand, are tw'o lofty fmall tubes, built up with bricks from the ground, and topped 
with cylinders of coarfe pottery, called the tobacco pipes.
This was a famous 
haven for importing tobacco, before the unhappy divifion of our colonies ; and, 
in the place noted, furnaces were built to burn the condemned tobacco : thefe 
tubes being contrived to carry the noxious fmoke high into the air, to prevent its 
dangerous influence.
As you defeend to the town from the northern road, it has a moft Angular 
appearance, the buildings lie fo deep in the creek, and the eminence you defeend 
is fo much fuperior, that you fee nothing but the flated roofs of the houfes.
This 
Angularity is an advantage to the traveller’s furprife, when he enters the town, 
confifting of wide and elegant ftreets; the houfes built in a modern ftyle and good 
tafte.
The approach is by a fine portico of red freeftone, with a rich entablature 
ornamented with the arms of the family of Lowther.
This edifice is not con- 
ftrutfted for (how only, but is devifed to continue the courfe of a gallery, by which 
the waggons laden with coals are deligned to.pafs to the haven, where they may 
deliver their contents.
Not fucceeding in Dublin, Mr. Bacon was encouraged and aflifted by his brother to try bis fortune in 
Maryland ; whither he foon after went ; and there, entering into holy orders, obtained, firft, a living In 
Talbot county ; and afterwards the beft living in the province, that of All-Saints, in Frederick county.
Few men, in any country, have ever been more refpected, than Mr. Bacon was in Maryland.
He pub- 
lilhed a fmall volume of fermons, which he had-firil preached to congregations of negroes : and which, 
like good Bilhop Wilfon’s “ Inftruftlons to the Indians,” were elleemcd for being plain, pious, and per- 
tinent.
He afterwards undertook and performed a work of immenfe labour and difficulty ; no lefs than 
the digefllng and compiling.
In one large folio volume, the whole body of laws of Maryland.
For this 
he was well rewarded by a very creditable fubfcriptlon.
His firll publication was “ A Syftem of the 
“ Revenue of Ireland,” a book, which Is fald to be ftill efteemed In that kingdom.
Mr. Bacon was twice married ; but never very happily.
He was a warm-hearted, benevolent man ; 
but, for want of oeconom.y, though he generally was in the receipt of an handfome income, a large por- 
tion of his life was fpent under difficulties and dillrefs.
His talents were various and refpeftable : there 
were few things, to which he applied himfelf.
In which he did not fucceed.
His attainments as a divine, 
a lawyer, and a phyficlan, were all confiderable ; but, he was thought particularly to fltinc as a mufician.
He was an exquifite performer ; and feveral pieces of mufic, of his compofing (under the humorous figna- 
ture Signhr Lardmi ) are Hill preferved and much efteemed in Maryland.

Mr. Hogarth meant this chapel to be of the eftablilh-

entered againft it by the lay impropriator of St. Bees.
Since that time it has been

There is alfo another Methodift chapel (in Michael-ftreet) in the fame con-

fideration of the Honourable House c/'Commons — 
The faid town and port of Whitehaven is fituate on the fea fliore, near four miles diftant from the 
parifh church, which faid town, about fixty years fince, confifted but of nine or ten thatched cottages.
That there are now above four hundred and fifty families in the faid town, producing in all two 
thoufand two himdred and twenty-two inhabitants, of whom, not above fifteen have eftates in the parifii, 
and the reft of them, only fuch riches as are in cafualties, depending on their trade at fea, and the fecurity 
of their Ihips and harbour, which are fubjeift to many dangers by fire, enemies, or otherwife.
The faid town is, of late years, very much improved in trade ; and, by great expence and charge of 
the Honourable Sir John Lovjther, Baronet, and the inhabitants, it is made a convenient poit and har- 
bour for fhips, to the great increafe of his majefty’s revenue, and the benefit of the adjacent country.
The inhabitants of the faid town and port (being fenfible of the great inconveniences they, and the 
ftrangers reforting thither, did dally fuffer, for want of a church fufficient to receive all perfons frequent- 
ing divine fervice there) did readily and chearfully contribute, with the faid Sir John L.owther, Baronet, 
to the building a convenient church, for the fervice and worfhip of God, which church was confecrated 
by his Lordlhlp the Bilhop of Chefter the i6th of July, 1693.
But, there being no regular provifion made for the repairs and fupport of the faid church, or for the 
prefervation of the faid harbour, fo that both are in great danger of falling to decay and utter ruin, for want 
of an equal diftribution of the charge fuch public works require, for the maintenance thereof ; the faid 
inhabitants, therefore, are now humble petitioners, with the faid Sir John Lowthcr, Baronet, That the 
faid town may be made a diftinft parifii of itfelf, and they thereby enabled to finilh and fupport their

The continual feuds and quarrels with the Scots, rendered this country the feat of 
arms and warfare : it was fubjedt to fuch repeated devaftations, that every branch 
of hufbandry, and every advancement of arts and fciences was almoft totally pre- 
vented, through the continual alarms and diftrefles occafioned by the incurfions of 
the northern bands.
f The inhabitants lived armed, and their pofleflions were 
chiefly herds and flocks, which they protedled by the fword, or fecured, on the 
alarm of an enemy, by driving them into the mountains and fecret faftnefles of the 
country.
It was not probable, under fo diflresful a fituation of life, that local 
employments, or the advantages of commerce, would be courted here.
The 
•j- Mr. Pennant fpeaks of Whitehaven in the following terms — “ Pafs through Diffington, a long 
“ and dirty town, and foon after, from a great height, at once come in fight of Whitehaven.
The town 
“ is in a manner a new creation, for the old editions of Camden make no mention of it ; yet the name 
“ is in Saxton’s maps, its white cliffs being known to feamen.
About a hundred years ago there was 
“ not one houfe here, except Sir John Lowther’s, and two others, and only three fmall veffels ; and for 
“ the next forty years, the number of houfes increafed to about twenty.
At this time the town may 
“ boaft of being one of the handfomefl In the north of England, built of ftone : it is populous, as it is 
“ elegant, containing 12,000 Inhabitants, and has 190 great fhips belonging to it, moftly employed in 
“ the coal trade.
The tobacco trade is much declined : formerly about 20,000 hoglheads were annu- 
“ ally imported from Virginia; now fcarce a fourth part of that number, Glafgow having ftolen that 
“ branch: but to make amends, another is carried on to the Weft Indies, where hats, printed linens, 
“ hams, &c.
are fent.
The laft week was a melancholy and pernicious exportation of 150 natives of 
“ Great Britain, forced from their natal foil, the lowlands of Scotland, by the rife of rents, to feek an 
“ afylum on the other fide of the Atlantic.
“ The Improvements in the adjacent lands keep pace with thofe in the town : the Branifty eftate, forty 
years ago, was fet for as many pounds; at prefent, by dint of good hufbandry, efpecially liming, is 
“ increafed to 571!.
“ St. James’s church is elegantly fitted up, and has a handfome gallery, which, with the roof, is fup- 
ported by moft beautiful ranges of pillars.
Befides, there Is a Prefbyterlan meeting-houfe, one of 
“ Seceders, one of Anabaptifts, and one of Quakers.
“ The workhoufe is thinly inhabited; for few of the poor chufe to enter.
Thofe vvhom necelllty 
“ compels, are moft ufefully employed : with pleafure I obferved old age.
Idiocy, and even infants of three 
“ years of age, contributing to their own fupport, by the pulling of oakum.
“ The harbour is artificial, but a fine and expenlive work, on the fouth end guarded by a long pier, 
where the fhips may lie in great fecurlty.
Another Is placed farther out, to break the force of the 
“ fea ; and within thefe are two long ftralght tongues or quays, where the veffels are lodged: clofe to 
“ the fhore, on the fouth fide, is another, covered with what is called here a fleer, having in the lower 
part a range of fmiths’ fhops, and above an extenfive floor, capable of containing 6000 waggon loads of 
“ coal, at 420olb.
each.
But this is only ufed as a fort of magazine ; for above this are covered galleries, 
“ with rail roads, terminating In large flues or hurries, placed floplng over the quay, and through thefe the 
coal is difeharged out of the waggons into the holds of the fliips.
Commonly eight fhips, from a hun- 
“ dred and twenty, to one hundred tons each, have been loaden in one tide ; and, on extraordinary occa- 
“ fions, twelve.
Each load is put on board for ten fliilh'ngs : and the waggons, after being emptied, are 
brought round into the road by a turnframe ; and drawn back by a Angle horfe.
The greater part of 
“ the way from the pits, which lie about three, or four miles diftant from the hurries.
Is down hill ; the 
“ waggon is fleered by one man, with a fort of rudder to dlredl it ; fo that he can retard or accelerate 
the motion, by the prefTure he gives by it on the wheel, 
“ Many other works are projedled to fecure the port, particularly another pier on the north fide, 
which, when complete, will render this haven quite land-locked.
It Is to be obferved, that in coming 
“ in, veffels fhould carry a full fail till they pafs the pier-head, otherwife they will not be carried far enough 
« in.

Ships feldom entered the bays of the coaft, but when they

This place was not fortunate in being parcel of the 
pofTeflion of St. Becs; the religious of whofe houfe, in all ages of their exiftence, 
being no friends to commerce, like the reft of their brethren ; fo that it was no- 
wonder, in the furvey taken in 1 566, noticed in our introdudfion, that the creek of 
Whitehaven held only fix filbermen’s cabins, and one fmall bark about nine tons 
burden ; fufficient to fupply the religious lociety with fifh, fait, and other articles, 
of their diet.
The great advancement and profperity of this place are to be attributed to the- 
Lowther family.
The lands of the dilfolved monaftery of St. Bees, w hich lay in 
the neighbourhood of Whitehaven, were purchafed by Sir Chriftopher Lowther, 
a fecond fon of the houfe of Lowther, in the life time of Sir John his father : he 
built himfelf a manfion houfe at the foot of the rock, at the weft end of the pre- 
fent town, near where the hurries now are ; the town at that time being deferibed 
to confift of a few fcattered huts, along the fhore of the creek.

commerce.

Sir John had conceived the projed of working the mines, and improving the 
commerce of this country ; and to that end he dehgncd to form the port, and 
render it commodious for {hipping ; and that, by an exclufive property, he might 
totally prevent all oppofition to his fcheme of operations, he received a grant from 
King Charles II.
A. D.
1666, of all the ungranted lands w ithin this dillricft ; and 
in 1678 he obtained all the lands, for two miles northward, between high and 
low water mark.
And from this period we may date the commencement of 
Whitehaven’s Hourifhing eilate.
d he late Sir James Lowther, fon of Sir John, profecuted the great plan of his 
father, and brought it to perfection.
The rapid progrefs of trade is marked by 
the increafe of inhabitants ; for it appears, that in 1633 towm confided of nine 
or ten thatched cottages; in 1693, there were 450 families here, confiding of 2272 
inhabitants ; in twenty-two years more they were increafed to 800 families.
Sir 
James had the fatisfaCtion to fee his native place rife from infignificance and ob- 
feurity, to an elevated degree of confequence in the commercial world, to great 
opulence and power; and that fiourifhing exiftence which he had cheriihed with 
all his efforts, now makes Whitehaven boad of upwards of 16,400 inhabitants.!
The progrefs of improvement is thus critically marked — By a printed lid found 
in the cudom-houfe at Whitehaven, it appears, thatdn 1685, there then belonged 
to the port of Whitehaven 46 fhips or vefiels, containing 1871 tons, (exclufive of 
boats) the lead of which, called The Contenty was twelve tons burthen, and the 
larged, called The Refolution, ninety-four tons, commanded by Richard Kelfick, 
in which he croffed the Wedern Ocean oftener than once to the province of Vir- 
ginia, and there took in a cargo of tobacco, and difeharged the fame at Whitehaven.
By the petition before given in the notes, it appears what was the date of 
population in 1693.
— In February, 1772, a printed lid w'as publifhed of the drips, 
didinguifhing them by names, rigging, and maders, (but no tonnage fpecified) 
by which it is dated, that 197 fhips or vefiels belonged to Whitehaven, 5 to Parton, 
97 to Workington, 76 to Maryport, and 12 to Harrington, exclufive of feveral 
fhips then building at thedifiei ent ports.
— By another lid, dated 20th May, 1790, 
it is dated, that 216 fhips or veffels belonged to Whitehaven, 1 16 to Workington, 
87 to Maryport, and 26 to Harrington, the total number being 445 ; and com- 
puting, on an average, that one with another each drip would be of 160 tons 
burthen, the total would be 7 1 ,200 ; and, at ten men each veffel, there would be em- 
ployed therein 4450 feamen.
There w'ere then on the docks 6 fhips at Whitehaven, 
3 at Workington, 5 at Maryport, and i at Harrington.
According to the account 
taken in 1790, of 71,200 tons, the tonnage, at 13I.
per ton, carpenters’ meafure, 
would cod 925,6001.
for the hull, iron work, anchors, cables, fails, rigging, &c.
fitted completely for fea, which is a fum fuppofed (by feveral intelligent perfons 
and captains of fhips, well acquainted with the different ports in Ireland) to exceed 
the value of all the /hipping belonging to that kingdom.
This wonderful increafe 
of {hipping belonging to the coads of Cumberland hath advanced in little more 
than two hundred years.

It is not fifty years fincc there was only one houfe at Maryport, called Valencia^ 
confequently not a fhip belonged thereto.
— Thirty years ago there was not one 
houie at Harrington, nor one Ihip belonging to that port.
The great increafe of (hipping and commerce may be principally attributed to 
the great attention paid to the coal and home trade by Chriftopher Low ther, Efq.
and his defeendants, viz.
his fon Sir John Lowther, Bart.
Sir James Lowther, Sir 
William Lowther, of Hoi ker- Hall, in Lancafliire, and laftly the Earl of Lonfdale.
It is with exultation for the caufe of humanity, and with particular fatisfadion 
in the praife of this place, that we notice the progrefs of the Whiteh avem 
Di SPENSARY.
It would be arrogant in us to attempt a more expreflive account of this inflitu- 
tion, than what is prefixed to the report for the year 1783, which is to the follow- 
ing elfed — “ In recommending this charitable inftitution to the patronage of the 
opulent, a variety of arguments, founded upon the principles of Chriftian bene- 
volence, and the feelings of humanity, were neceffarily employed : the teftimony 
of experience has fince been obtained, decifively to prove its utility.
The great 
numbers of miferable objeds, labouring under the complicated evils of poverty 
and PAIN, who have been either entirely cured or confiderably relieved from 
“ their complaints, proclaim its trueft praife : and, at the fame time, fuggeft the 
** mod peiTuafive motives to animate all wEo are blefied with the ability, to feed 
and replenilh the fountain from whence thefe falutary ftreams diffufively flow.
To the lowed clafs of laborious, infirm, and aged people, who folely, and w’ith 
** difficulty, acquire the frugal necefiariesof life, the aids of medicine and surgery 
“ are alfo liberally difpenfed.
Thefe have now an afylum from all thofe calami- 
tics to which ficknefs, in their contraded circumdances, renders them exceed- 
“ ingly liable.
— The pad feafon, from its remarkable and permanent feverity, has 
** very much increafed the number of applications to this charity ; the benevolent 
“ edablifhers of which, may indulge the grateful fatisfadion of having perfedly 
” obviated not a few of thofe didrelfes, to which the indigent and indudrious were 
** confequently expofed..
The principal regidered difeafes will properly fugged a few brief obfervations.
With regard to their nature and tendency, more minute information may be re- 
** ceived at the Difpenfary; where the cafes and their modes of treatment are parti- 
cularized: and the whole, with their refpedive events, fydematically arranged.
The fird objeds of this charity were thofe who had laboured under the vari- 
oils and poignant fufferings of long protraded difeafe, the fymptoms of which 
could only admit a temporary mitigation.
In the autumnal months of Septem- 
“ ber, Odober, and November, a nervous fever, didinguidied by very powerful 
“ charaders, took place in Charles-dreet ; extending its malignancy to the adja- 
** cent, mod confined fituations.
To the ufeful medical attentions was added an 
efpecial regard to the regimen of the patients; clcanlinefs and pure air being 
dridly enjoined, and every precaution taken to prevent the communication of 
“difeafe.
The neceffituous fick were* alfo fupplied with requifite quantities of 
wine, and occafionally recommended to public or private charities.
Twenty- 
fix of thefe cafes were then admitted, and happily they all recovered.
During 
• “ the 
WHITEHAVEN.
SJ 
“ the winter a numerous train of pecftoral and inflammatory diforders (to which 
“ this climate and feafon are peculiarly liable) very generally prevailed ; efpccially 
“ catarrhs, confumptions, with more acute rheumatic and pleuritic alfediions.
— In 
“ the beginning of Otflober the fmall-pox became epidemical, and has continued 
“ fo thefe lafl eight months.
Of the patients who fuffered the natural infeeftion (in 
all three hundred and twenty) feventy-three died, and fixty-nine with difficulty 
“ recovered from a ftate of remarkable confluency and danger.
The hooping cough 
" has lately very mildly and partially prevailed ; requiring, for the mofl: part, 
“ fcarcely any medical affiflance.
To the influence of this falutary feafon w ill the 
“ cure of the prefent, and the prevention of ihe future difeafe be chiefly attributed.
“ The only other contagion of any moment was that of dyfentery ; which has, at 
different periods of the preceding year, repeatedly and violently occurred.
In 
“ the contracted habitations of the indigent, where many of the effential neceffa- 
“ ries, and all the conveniences of life, were frequently wanting, its baneful 
“ progrefs and effects became not lefs extenfive than potent.
Forty-nine of thefe 
“ patients have been already admitted : thirty-one were difmilfed cured : and the 
“ remaining eighteen ftill continue upon the books.
Relative to the furgical cafes, 
in which the aids of art were more obvioufly and certainly ufeful, upwards of 
“ two hundred perfons have experienced the benefits of this inftitution.
“ The influence of this charity, fince its eftablifhment, has been gradually and 
“ confiderably extended.
Regardful of our maritime fituation, and the dangers 
“ to w hich w e are inevitably expofed, it was deemed eligible to form a connedlion 
“ with the London Humane Society, and very generally to diflribute its judi- 
“ cious inftrudions ; procuring at the fame time a complete apparatus for the 
“ recovery of perfons apparently drowned.
The modes of treatment beft adapted 
" to reftore fuch deplorable objeds will be now univerfally known, and the intel-' 
“ ligent of every profeffion are earneftly requeffed to occafionally put them in 
“ immediate and vigorous execution.
“ The pradice of general inoculation was next very ftrenuoufly recommended, 
and the advantages deducible from it publicly announced ; the poor wxre, how- 
“ ever, fo remarkably averfe to the propofal, that thirty children only could be 
“permitted to comply with it; not an individual of which required the leafl; 
“ medical attention.
“ Several additional fubferiptions and augmentations for the enfuing year have 
“ been already received, and it is ardently hoped that the more general contributions 
“ of the public will afford the pleafing opportunity of perfedly accornplifhing the 
“ benevolent intentions of this charity.” 
The benefadions and fubferiptions that year amounted to 206I.

“ of drowning bodies from the water, was prefented to this charity by Dodlor 
“ Hawes, the benevolent inflitutor and regifter of the Humane Society ; to whofe 
“ goodnefs it is alfo indebted for a great variety of moft ufeful information refpedl- 
ing the important fubjed of fufpended animation.”* 
The mouth of the creekf opens upon the Irifli channel to the north-well, u here 
the river Poe empties itfelf between two promontories, one to the weft, called 1 om 
Hurd Rock, the other to the eaftward, called Jack-a-Dandy Hill ; and from the 
grey rock of the former, tradition fays, the town took its name of Whitehaven ; 
but others, with more plaufibility, affert, from fome accounts handed down, thac 
the firfl: filherman that frequented this bay lived at Sandwath, about two miles 
from Whitehaven, who built a little thatched cottage there, (yet remaining) to 
flielter himfelf, now called the Old Tow n ; and that his furname was White, and 
from this circumflance the place took the name of White's Haven.
This opinion 
meets with credit : over the door of the cottage are cur the figures 1592.
The 
haven is defended by four moles of flone-work, three of which projedl in parallel 
lines from the land; the fourth towards the fouth, bending in the form of a crefeent, 
has a watch houfe and battery, and at its extremity a light-houfe.
The haven is dry 
at ebb of tide, fo that the fhipping within the moles lie as in dry-docks.
— A ton- 
nage is eftabliflied here by ad of parliament, w hich affords a fund for erecting and 
maintaining thefe great works.
The method of delivering the coals into the fhips 
is fingular, and, we may venture to fay, almoff peculiar to the county ; the depth 
of the creek, w’hich forms the haven beneath the adjoining banks, affords a means 
for the waggons bringing the coals from the works to approach the very haven ; 
they are received inio a gallery or ffaith, built of wood, projecting over, the quay, 
immediately beneath which the velTel that is taking in her lading lies, ar any flage 
of the tide, and the waggon bottom ftriking out, in a few feconds of time delivers 
the coals into a conductor or trough, by which they fall into the fliip’s hold; thefe 
arc called hurries : fo that there is no hand heaving, as is the cafe in other coal- 
ports.
Eight or ten vclfels, of near one hundred and twenty tons burden, are 
loaden in a tide, at the fmall expence of ten fliillings each.
Some former publications give an account of thefe mines to the following efteCl

• Since the eflabliihment of the Difpenfary epidemical difeafes have been much lefs prevalent, which 
may, in a great meafure, be attiibuted to cleanlinefs.
The allowance of wine in midwifery and febrile 
cafes has lately been confiderably enlarged ; and nurfe-keepers employed in many cafes, and paid from 
the fund of the Difpenfai7 : all which regulations have been the means of meliorating the condition of 
the inhabitants.

the globe, penetrated to fo great a depth below the furface of the fca ; the verf 
deep mines in Hungary, Peru, and clfewhere, being fituated in mountainous 
“ countries, where the furface of the earth is elevated to a great height above the 
“ level of the ocean.
“ There are here three (Irata of coal, which lie at a confiderable diftance one 
above another, and there is a communication by pits between one of thefe parallel 
“ ftrata and another.
But the vein of coal is not always regularly continued in 
the fame inclined plane, but inflead thereof the miners meet with hard rock, 
which interrupts their further progrefs.
At fuch places there feems to have 
been breaks in the earth, from the furface downwards ; one part of the earth 
“ feeming to have funk down, while the part adjoining hath remained in its 
ancient fituation.
In fome of thefe places the earth may have funk ten or 
twenty fathoms or more ; in other places lefs than one fathom.
Thefe breaks 
the miners call dykes ; and when they come at one of them, their firff care is to 
difcover whether the ftrata in the part adjoining be higher or lower than in the 
part where they have been working : or, to ufe their own terms, whether the 
coal be caft down or caft up.
If it be caft down, they fink a pit to it; but if it 
be caft up to any confiderable height, they are often times obliged, with great

“ The coal in thcfc mines hath feveral times been fet on fire by the fulminating 
damp, and hath continued burning for many months ; until large ftreams of 
water were conduced into the mines, and fuffered to fill thofe parts where the 
coal was on fire.
By fuch fires feveral collieries have been entirely deftroyed ; 
of which there are infiances near Newcaftie, and in other parts of England ; and 
" in the (hire of Fife, in Scotland; in fome of which places the fire has continued 
burning for ages.
“ In order to prevent, as much as pofilble, the collieries from being filled with 
«* thofe pernicious damps, it has been found necelfary carefully to fearch for thofe 
crevices in the coal, from whence they ilTue out ; and, at thofe places, to con- 
fine them within a narrow fpace ; and from thofe narrow fpaces, in which they 
** are confined, to'condud: them through long pipes into the open air; w'here, 
being fet on fire, they confume in perpetual flames, as they continually arife out 
of the earth.
The late Mr. Spedding, who was the great engineer of thefe w'orks, having 
obferved that the fulminating damp could only be kindled by flame, and that 
it w'as not liable to be fet on fire by red-hot iron, nor by fparks produced by the 
collifion of flint and fi:eel,t invented a machine, in which, while a fteel wheel is 
turned round with a very rapid morion, and flints are applied thereto, great 
plenty of fiery fparks are emitted, that afford the miners fuch a light, as enables 
them to carry on their work in clofe places, where the flame of a candle or lamp 
would occafion dreadful explofions.
Without fome invention of this fort, the 
" w orking of thefe mines, fo greatly annoyed with thefe inflammable damps, would 
long ago have been impracticable.
“ ^t not fo many mines have been ruined by fire as by inundations.
And here 
that noble invention, the fire-engine^ difplays its beneficial effects.
It appears, 
“ from pretty exact calculations, that it would require about five hundred and fifty 
“ men, or a pou'er equal to that of an hundred and ten horfes, to work the pumps 
“ of one of the largeft fire-engines now in ufe, (the diameter of whofe cylinder is 
“ feventy inches) and thrice that number of men to keep one of this fize conftantly 
at work : and that as much w'ater may be raifed by an engine of this fize, kept 
“ confiantly at work, as can be drawn up by two thoufand five hundred and twenty 
men with rollers and buckets, after the manner now daily praeffifed in many 
mines ; or as much as can be borne up on the fhoulders of twice that number 
of men, as faid to be done in fome of the mines of Peru.
So great is the power 
" of the elaftic fleam of the boiling water in thofe engines, and of the outward 
** atmofphere, which, by their alternate aeflions, give force and motion to the beam 
of this engine; and by it to the pumprods, which elevate the water through tubes, 
" and difcharge it out of the mine.
There are four fire-engines belonging to this 
colliery, which, when all at work, difcharge from it about 1228 gallons every 
minute, at thirteen flrokes, and, after the fame rate, 1,768,320 gallons every^ 
twenty-four hours.
By the four engines here employed, nearly twice the above- 
mentioned quantity of water might be difchargeci from mines that are not above 
f This is proteci not to be an effectual prefervative.

Mr. Pennant’s account of thefe collieries is to the following effedl — “ Vifit the

« in circumference ; not above a third of the coal having been worked in this 
“ place; fo that to me the very columns feemed left as refources for fuel in future 
“ times.
The immenfe caverns that lay between the pillars exhibited a moft 
“ gloomy appearance : I could not help inquiring after the imaginary inhabitant, 
the creation of the labourers’ fancy, “ The fwart fairy of the mine,” and was 
“ ferioufly anfwered by a black fellow at my elbow, that he had really never met 
“ with any ; but that his grandfather had found the little implements and tools 
belonging to this diminutive race of fubterraneous fpirits.f 
“ The beds of coal are nine or ten feet thick : and dip to the weft: one yard, in 
eight.
In various parts are great bars of ftone, which cut off the coal: if they 
“ bend one way, they influence the coal to rife above one’s head ; if another, to

“ about the drifts and chambers of the works, feem perpetually employed, yet do nothing ; fome feem 
to cut the ore, or fling what is cut into veflels, or turn the windlafs ; but never do any harm to the 
« miners, except provoked ; as the fenfible Agricola, in this point credulous, relates in his book Dc 
“ Animantibus Subterratieis.”

At what a profound depth are beds of

are comipofed, and which vegetables muft have flouriflied on the furface of the earth, or on the bottom of 
the fea.
In the country about Namur there are coal pits at the depth of two thoufand feet.
At 
Whitehaven, a vein of coal runs a quarter of a mile under the fea.
But, all ftrata of llmeftone, chalks*

ol our globe, which has not at fome time or other been wafted by the fury of fubterranean fire.
For 
inftance, independent of thofe we have already mentioned, what innumerable volcanic remains in Afia, in 
the Philippine, in the Molucca, in the Japan, in the Bourbon, and in the Sumatra iflands.
In Africa, 
how prominently they appear.

for its principal link.
How interefting would a volcanic map of the two hemifpheres be 1 What a 
world it would Ihew us !
If again thofe apparent veftiges of marine produftions, which are obferved 
indiferiminately fcattered through the eaith at all depths below its furface, and on the fummit of its 
higheft mountains, be efteemed fufficient proofs of the prefence of the ocean in thofe places, a feene no 
lefs wild and uncommon than the former rifes before our imagination ; in which the produfts of the 
equator and the poles appear to be jumbled together in a manner incapable of being explained by any 
of the known analogies of nature.
“ The immenfe quantities of petrified fea bodies, found in fo many different places and fituatlons, are 
affuredly inftance* fufficient to prove, that they could not have been tranfported and depofited in thofe 
fituatlons by the waters of any one general fubmerfion ; for the greater part of them, Inftead of being 
found In the bowels of the earth, and in folid marble, at the depth of feven or eight hundred feet, muft 
have remained on the furface.
Another proof is, that the .bones, horns, claws, &c.
of land animals, are 
feldom found in a petrified ftate, and are rarely incorporated in marl, or other hard ftones ; whereas, if 
thefe effefts had been produced by a deluge, the remains of land animals would have been found In marls, 
as well as thofe of fiflres.
Let us look into the excavations that have been formed by nature or by art.
From the loweft valley whence we can defeend, we find prodigious heaps of marine bodies at immenfe 
depths, either In quarries of calcareous ftone, in foffils, &c.
and we find them alfo In the towering ftrata 
of mountains ; in the mid regions of continents as well as In iflands ; from the fummits even of the Alps, 
to fome hundreds of feet below the level of Amfterdam.
“ The ftrata in which many foffils are thus found, prove them, I muft believe, to be of an antldlkivlan 
per’od, — a period beyond the records of men, and attended with fuch circumftances, that we might not 
unreafonably conceive fome calamitous event had deftroyed the greateft part of animal life from the face 
of the earth, and conligned to oblivion a caufe, the record of which muft otherwife have been tranfmitted 
from pofterlty to poftenty, to the very end of time.
Thefe foffil phrenomena, indeed, afford a fufficlency 
of examples to incline phllofophers to the opinion, that the earth has undergone commotions abftrafted 
from a deluge, and that thofe commotions rriight have deftroyed its inhabitants partially, If not gene- 
rally.
But, had the fea little by little got over the face of the earth ; had it covered and proportionably 
uncovered the plains and the loftleft mountains ; we fliould in fuch cafe, with the fpoils of that element, 
ever)' where find innumerable veftiges of the habitations of men.
We fhould every where fee monuments 
varied according to countries, and-fhewlng as many different charafters, as there have been levolutlons in 
the immenfe duration of eternity.
But there are no fuch traces to be difeovered.
In every corner we 
fee marks of the dwelling of the fea, but none of thofe fubmerged monuments, which ought to be met 
with.
The earth, then, muft repeatedly have burft, and the waters have ruihed into the chafms, and 
clufed the feene of exiftence.
“ The petilfadllons which are thus found in a foffil ftate are various.
It Is worth, however, obferving 
that thofe of fhells, are found on, or neartft to, the earth ; thofe of fifti, deeper ; and thofe of wood 
deepeft.
That organic fubftances are moft commonly found In ftrata of marl, chalk, limeftone, or clay ;

“ There was much ground.
Indeed at one time, for this quefllon ; for, though the feripture declares, 
that all the foundations of the great deep were broken up, yet we have no authority to conclude, that 
this convulfion was In its effedls equal to thofe which have produced the foffil phacnomena, that are found

ftrata of foffil bones, found on the coafts of Iftria and Dalmatia, in the iflands of Cherfo and Ofero, in 
the ifland of Cyprus, in moft of the iflands of the iEgean fea, and the rock of Gibraltar ; which imply 
the moil convincing proof of an alluvian, by the diflocation and fraXure of the bones, and here and there 
fmall fpecimens of fliell fifli emboffed in the mafs ; whereas all the large fpoils of marine animals are never 
found with them.
— Moreover, the produce of refpeXIve climes, fo imbedded, ought to have been found 
approximate to the fpot, wlicrc the convulfion fo happened.
But whence the exotic foffils that have 
been difeovered ?
“In North and South America, in Ruffia, and Germany, foffil tulks and bones, of a veiy large lize, 
have frequently been found.
According to tradition, thefe were reported to he tlie tuflcs and bones of

our globe.

continent, not yet penetrated by Europeans.
Several eminent naturalllls of late years, as Sir Hans Sloane, 
Gmelin, Dauber.
ton, and Buffon, are of opinion that thefe prodigious bones and tulks are really the bones 
and tufl<s of elephants ; and many modern philofophers have held the mammouth to be as fabulous as the 
centaur.
But the two celebrated DoXors Hunter have proved, by the diffimilitude of thefe foffils, with 
the bones and tulks of the elephant, but more particularly from the fliape of the grinders, which clearly 
appear to be thofe of a carniverous animal, or at leaft of an animal of the mixed kind, being furniflred 
with a double row of high and conic proceffes, as if intended to mafticate, not to grind the food ; and 
the enamel making a cruft on the outfide only of the teeth, as in a human grinder ; tliat they are totally 
different from the elephant ; the elephant being well known not to be carniverous, but to be of the gra- 
minivorous kind, both from the form of its grinders, and by hs never tailing animal food.
Others again 
have fuppofed thefe foffil bones to belong to the hippopotamus ; but tliere are many reafons againft fuch 
affuppofition.
The hippopotamus is even much fmaller than the elephant, and has fuch remarkable Ihort 
legs, that his belly defeends within three or four inches of the ground.
The foffil thigh bones of the 
mammouth, on the contrary, are evidently the thigh bones of fome amazingly large animal.
There are 
fome of them nearly four feet in length : and they confequently are, with pretty ftrong arguments,

The wifdom of God may have made other kinds of 
things before this prefent face of being began, and may make otlier kinds of things after this face 'of 
being fliall be no more.
But the unknown exiftence of the animal is all that we can argue from.
The 
principal property of nature, is to be always confident with herfelf.
Gravelly and fandy foils, which 
often abound with the vitriolic acid, will, in a (hort fpace of time, confume or difeompofe animal fubftances; 
whereas chalky and marly foil, not having the acid quality in any like proportion, will preferve bones', 
w hen fecure from the filtration of water, to any length of time.
Yet, a petrified human body was found 
in 1722, which lay buried above fifty years in the copper-mines of Falham, in Dalecarlia, according to 
I.innaeus: now this is a recent fa6l, which furnifiies an undeniable proof that petrifications have been pro- 
duced within thefe laft hundred years ; and hence no very conclufive argument can be deduced from the 
petrification of animal fubdances, in favour of antediluvian phaenomena.
The more convincing criteria 
are thofe we have already touched upon.
The evidence Is clear, that the fea and land change pUice, not 
only from the effe<2:s of general and dated periodical laws, but from a variety of revolutions occalioned by 
particular and accideiu.al caufes.

It is true he has others, but nothing near 
“ fo great and rich as this is.
He draws water from his coal-works, by an engine 
** with four pumps and four lifts ; one of the pumps goes down eighty fathoms, 
** which brings up the water to a ciftern fixty fathoms deep, from thence another 
** pump raifes it to a ciftern of forty fathcms deep, from the furface, or top of the 
fink, a third pump brings it up to twenty, and a fourth quite up to the level of 
** the lea at high water.
The cylinder, which gives life to this motion, is of brafs, 
** fourteen inches in diameter, fixed on a boiler of eleven feet diameter.
The coal, when brought up to the level of the fea, is put on flips, and con- 
** veyed into the cavity of a hill, whence it is drawn up by a fecond engine.
The 
ftrata of coal are five or fix in number, the greateft is about fix feet in thick- 
“ nefs, and foinetimes feven or eight : the next is about five feet, one is three feet, 
** and another about two feet thick.
“ The quantity yet left to work, is, in my opinion, no great matter, though they 
“ talk of two miles under the fea, for, a few years w ill exhauft it : and if the roof 
gives way in any one place, the coal will not only be drowned in a moment, but 
“ above two hundred people w'ill lofe their lives.

WHITEHAVEN, 
** accidentally met with it ifi other reading : however I will venture to give the 
beft reply I can, your requefts being always commands to me.
As to the antiquity of working coal about Newcaftle.* The inteftine wars 
** among the 'Biitons and Saxons, and afterwards of the Saxons among themfelves, 
which were almofl continual, befides the invafions of the Danes, and the wars 
with Scotland for three or four reigns after the Norman 'conqueft, during which 
time this country, as may be faid, was always under fire and fword, together 
with its never being mentioned in hiftory, makes me think it was not followed 
till about the time of King Henry III.
The firfl mention I have feen of coal- 
working there, is in ahiflory of the town of Newxaflle, publifhed in the year 1736, 
p. 158.
where, it is faid, they had a grant from King Henry III.
to dig coals in 
«' Cafllefield and the Frith, dated in the 23d year of his reign, A.
D. 1239.
Carbo 
Marinus is alfo mentioned by Matthew Paris, A.
D. 1245.
But the working 
of coal may have been much earlier in other parts of this kingdom ; a flint axe 
** having been found in fome veins of Coal expofed to fight in a rock called Lraigy 
«* Park, in Monmouthfhire, which was then laid open to day, might be very 
” well difeovered and Wrought by the people that ufed fuch tools, — the ancient 
** Britons, as I fuppofe.
The counties in England producing coal, are Cumberland, Wcftmorland, 
” Northumberland, Durham, Yorkfiiire, (chiefly the weft ridingj Lancafhire, 
‘Cheflii're,'Derbyfhire, Ndttinghamfhire, Leicefterfhire,StafFordfi'iire, Shropfhire, 
Worcefterihire, GlouCefterfhire, Somerfetfhire, North Wales and South Wales.
As the ftrata of coal generally lie bfedded be'tw'een two other flrata of ftone, 
** and rife and dip in parallel lines ‘with them, they feem to me coeval with the 
« texture df Our globe; and to have undergone the fame conCufiions, that it has 
** fuffered ; it being hard to conceive ‘how fdft earth, included between two fuch 
folid bodies, fhould imbibe a fulphureous or bituminous matter from or through 
them.
There is indeed fuch aTulphureous matter fourrd in Coal-pits ; but to me 
it appears much more reafonable to think it was fhut up at the fame time with 
** other fubffancesj’than enter into the compofition of coal.
The ftrata of coal feem to be within a very fmall Compafs on the globe.
I 
“ have met with an obfervation, that if a line is drawm from the mouth of Severn 
to Newcaftle, and fo round the earth, that all coal will be found to lie within a 
very fmall diftance of it, on one fide or other :* the coal found in Europe, at leaft 
the fartheft diftance eaftward, is, I believe, about Liege; and weftward, in the 
“ mountains of Kilkenny, in Ireland, both within two hundred and fifty miles of 
it.
But I think there was no occafion to ftretch the line round the world, 
«♦ for all the coal we know of is contained wdthin the latitudes of our own ifland, 
except what I remember to have heard affirmed fome years ago in the Houfe of 
Commons, upon the debate about the bill of commerce with France, fhould prove 
me rniftaken, by which the ifle of Cape Breton was given up to that crown, and 
“ faid to abound with excellent coal ; but as I could never finceimeet with a

WHITEHAVEN.
I cannot fay any thing as to the coal being common fuel in China, not 
having the millionary letters by me, There is a tradition at London, that 
Blackbeath, above Greenwich, is full of coal, but not permitted to be wrought 
for the encouragement of navigation, and the Newcaftle trade, which, I dare lay, 
“ is falfe : this I am fure of, that there is no law againft it, and though the heath 
“ belongs to the crown, and no king ever gave leave to dig it, yet it is ftrange, 
** that none of the neighbouring land-owners fhould ever be allured, by the vaft 
" profits it wculd bring them, to fearch for coal, and work it there, w hen found 
in their own cfiates, which they could not be debarred from, but by acfl of 
parliament, which would be fuch a deprivation of property, as, I believe, no 
Houfe of Commons would confent to.
" I fuppofe the adl of Henry V.
you hint at, is that in his 9th year, for 2d.
a 
** chaldron of coals to be paid by fuch as are not infranchifed, and for the meafure- 
” ment of keels.
The author of the Newcaftle Hiftory fays, that in the ift of 
“ Edward 11 1.
’s ftatutes mention is made De Carbonibus Maritimis, which, I 
fuppofe, is Newxaftle coal : but I cannot find it in any of our ftatute books, 
** though 1 have the firft that was ever printed.” 
The reader, we doubt not, will pardon the prolixity of the foregoing Letters, as 
they contaiji feveral very curious particulars, not impertinent to our fubjetft.
Xbe follozving Remarks were made in Confequence of a very attentive Enquiry amongfi 
the IV irkmen^ and Others, employed in thefe great Works.
It would not be difficult to an obferving man, to difcover that there wer^ 
coal here, as two bands, or feams, fhew themfelves in feveral places on the 
Hoping furface, on the weft fide of the valley leading from Whitehaven to Sr.
Bees.
It appears that this valley w'as formerly an arm of the fea, which feparated, 
all the hilly ground betwixt that valley and the fea, at prefent containing above ' 
four miles in length, and above one mile in breadth, from the land, or ground, on 
the eaft fide of the valley.
The land along the valley, from Whitehaven har-, 
hour to St. Bees, about five miles in length, is at this time very nearly upon a level ; 
and one half of the rivulet, called Powbeck, runs with a very eafy current from 
about the middle w ay of the valley to the fea at St, Bees ; and the other half, from 
about the fame middle way, with a current equally gentle, to the fea at Whitehaven 
harbour.
The whole valley might be cut through, fo as to rnake it navigable for 
large veffels at a very moderate expence, which would be of great ufe to fhips 
coming to Whitehaven, as they often get in behind St, Bees-head, and with certain 
winds cannot get round the heads, which they muft do to gain Whitehaven har- 
bour, by which means feveral veffels have fuffered extremely ; whereas, if the cut 
before pointed out was made, fhips might pafs in or out, to or from, Whitehaven 
harbour either way, and almoft with any wind.
The evidences of this valley be- 
ing -formerly occupied by the fea, are, Firft, the anchor of a fhip w'as dug up out 
* “ Sir Hans Sloan fays, in his voyage to Jamaica, that there is a kind of fine coal in Barbadoes, and 
« in his return, that they took a French ihip bound to Canada for coals.”

©f the ground from a confiderable depth, about half way along the valley : — 
Secondly, the hilly land before-mentioned, which lies to the eaftward of the valley, 
and which reaches irom Whitehaven to St. Bees, in old deeds is called Prefton 
Ifle: — Thirdly, the very Imall afcent of the ground through the whole valley and 
ftrata, which exhibit the appearance of the fea having flowed there.
This valley 
has probably been filled up by the tide flowing in at both ends, and the two tides 
meeting, would naturally in that place depofit a fediment, which gradually, but 
perpetually increafing, would block up the middle part firff, and the banks by 
degrees extending, the whole would in time be filled up, as we fee it now is.
It appears, that at the firft beginning to work the coal near Whitehaven, a 
level or water-courfe has been driven from the bottom of this valley, near the 
Powbeck before mentioned, to the fouth of the town, beginning near the copperas 
work.
This level was driven till it interfetffed the feam of coal, now called by the 
workmen, the Bannock Bandt it drained a very confiderable bed or field of coal, 
which has been drawn out of pits from twenty to fixty yards deep.
After this a 
level has been driven from the Powbeck, near the farm-houfc called Thicker, 
farther towards the fouth than the firfl:.
By continuing this level to the weflward, 
the feam now called the Main Band has been interfered.
This level alfo effec- 
tually drained a large bed of coal.
The coals were then drawn out of the pits 
by men with jack-rowls, or windlaflcs.
and were carried from the pits to the fifips 
by galloways or fmall horfes, upon their backs in packs, weighing about fourteen 
Hone each, and meafuring about three Winchefter bufliels, or twenty-four gal- 
lons.
There is a print of Whitehaven extant, in which is exhibited a man driving 
fome of thefe galloways, with packs of coals on their backs, towards the fhips.
A later attempt to get coals here was made at a place, now called Gins, which 
is a little village or hamlet, near Whitehaven, towards the fouth-wefl, in the 
valley abovementioned, and near the Powbeck.
In this place they drew the coals 
and water alfo from the pit, with horfes and vertical gins.
A few houfes were 
crefled near thofe gins or machines, which gradually increafing in number, be- 
came a confiderable village, and is now called by the name of Gins.
Drawing 
the water by thefe machines or gins with horfes was very expenfive, and took 
away much of the profit arifing from the colliery.
To remedy this, the late Sir 
James Lowther is faid to have purchafed the materials of a fire, or fleam engine 
in London, which had been ufed there for raifing water for the ufe of the city.
Report fays, that this was the fecond fleam engine in England.
It was fent by a 
ihip from London to Whitehaven, and fixed upon a pit near the Gins, which pit 
IS faid to be near fixty yards deep.
As the number of pits increafed, the water increafed, which caufed another 
more powerful engine to be creefled.
By thefe two engines, a confiderable extent 
of coals were drained, from which the town and export market were feveral years 
fupplied.
A pit was then funk about half a mile from the flaith, which is clofe 
by the harbour.
This pit was called Parker Pity and from this pit the firfl; 
waggon-way v.'as laid in this county.
On the w'eft fide of the town, adjoining to 
the harbour, is the coal flaith, where five yeffels of 300 tons burthen are frequently .
loato* 
WHITEHAVEN.
67 
loaden from the hurries at one time.
By an eafy and gentle defcent, the loaden 
waggon runs by its own weight on the frame of the way, with above two tons of 
coals therein, from the pit to the ftaith, without any horfe to draw it.
Where 
the defcent is fo great, that the motion of the waggon becomes too rapid, a man 
who is mounted behind the waggon, by prefling down upon one of the wheels a 
piece ot wood called the convoy, fixed to the waggon for that purpofe, can re- 
flrain the motion, fo as to moderate it fufflciently.
The only ufe for a horfe is to 
draw the empty waggon back again, to the pit along another road, laid at a fmall 
diflance from the fide of the road, down which the loaden waggons defeend.
By 
this contrivance, the loaden and empty waggons never interrupt or Interfere with 
each other ; and by this kind of w'aggon and road, one horfe does as much work 
as twenty-four pack horfes ufed to do.
When there are no fhips ready to receive coals, they arc depofited in the flaith, 
W'hich will hold about three thoufand waggons.
Thcfe coals are again put into 
waggons, and dropped through the hurries into fliips, when there arc more velfels 
than the ufual daily fupply wdll readily load : we were told, that there have been 
200 waggons or 400 tons ihipped thus in one day from the pits, and 200 waggons 
more from the flaith, making in all, 400 waggons, or above 800 tons in one day.
The next attempt to get coals was made about eighty years ago, at a place 
called Saltom, near the fea, about a mile fouth-wefl; of the town, as we were in- 
formed by thofe who converfed with an old man, lately dead, who remembered 
it.
This was an expenfive undertaking; a fire or fleam engine w'as ereded there, 
with a forty inch cylinder; the pumps were divided into four fets or lifts, the pit 
being faid to be 150 yards deep.
A few years after, a fecond fire engine was 
ereded at Saltom of the fame dimenfions as the firft, in order to aflift in drawing 
the water, which was much increafed by finking feveral other pits.
Thefe two 
engines drained a very extenfive field of coal.
As pits are in time exhaufled, it is 
deemed prudent now and then to drive what the workmen call trial drifts, in 
order to find proper places to put down new pits, when wanted.
About twelve years ago, thefe two engines being nearly worn out, a new one 
was ereded at Saltom, capable of drawing more water than both the old ones.— 
It has two boilers, of fifteen feet diameter each, a feventy inch cylinder, and eleven 
and a half inches working barrel.
It is faid, that in fummer it can draw all the 
w'ater in eight hours, and in winter in fixteen, which is produced in the whole 
twenty-four hours.
About three years ago this engine was repaired ; there was 
a new cylinder, new regulating beam, and feveral other new parts.
Its maximum 
in working is fifteen flrokes, each fix and a half feet long, in a minute.
Twenty- 
leven gallons of water are drawn by each flroke, which is 405 gallons per minute, 
or 9240 hogfheads in twenty-four hours.
About 150 years ago, coals are fuppofed to have been firfl raifed here.
What 
the export trade has been at different periods, we cannot well afeertain, but by 
the beft inquiry which we have been able to make at different times from the feve- 
ral waggoners, who are employed in carrying coals from the different pits, we may 
venture to affert, that within the laft twenty years, the export trade has increafed 
near one third part.
There are two collieries near Whitehaven, one called How- 
I 2 gill.
WHITEHAVEN.
gill, which is in the Ifle of Prefton before mentioned, and lays to the fouth-weft 
of the town ; the other called Whingill, and lays to the fouth-eafl.
From the 
colliery of Howgill alone, for a few years lafl paiV, above 50,000 waggons, or 
100,000 tons, have been raifed yearly, and above half that quantity from the 
Whingill colliery : and yet we have been afTured by many of the workmen, that 
there is coal enough, not yet raifed, to fupply exportation at the prefent rate, for 
near two hundred years to come.
Hence, the quantity raifed yearly, feems to 
be about eighty thoufand waggons ; each waggon is equal to a chaldron and one 
quarter, London meafure; it contains twenty-four Cumberland bufhels, orfeventy- 
two Winchefter bufhels, and weighs in general from forty-two to forty-four hun- 
dred weight.
The belt coals are invariably the lighteft.
The workmen in How'gill colliery all 
agree, that the feam of coal, called the Main Band^ is the beff ; and that about one 
third part which lay in the middle of the feam, if feparated, would be as good as 
the beft Newcaflle coal, which feveral of them very well know.
The workmen fur- 
ther fay, that the fink or bottom of the feam is worfe : however, the whole, when 
mixed, is allowed in Dublin to be the beft and moft ufeful of any coals which arc 
exported from this county.
In Howgill colliery, the workmen fay, there are five 
workable feams of coal, befides feveral fmall ones, in a pit called King Pit^ which 
the workmen fay, is the deepeft pit here, or in Great Britain: they call the nrft 
feam, the Crow Coal, which is about two feet thick, and about fixty yards deep.
The fecond feam, they call the 7 ard Band, which is about four feet thick, and 
one hundred and fixty yards deep.
The third feam, they call the Bannock Band, 
which is about eight feet thick, and two hundred yards deep.
The fourth feam, 
they call the Main Band, which is about eleven feet thick, and two hundred and 
forty yards deep.
The fifth or laft feam, is about five feet thick, and three hun- 
dred and twenty yards deep.
Our informers obferved, that none of this fifth feam 
has ever yet been worked.
To the fouthward of Howgill colliery, thefe feams of 
coal are thrown much nearer the furface by dykes, which are upcafts fometimes 
thirty or forty yards.
This colliery abounds with fuch dykes, as they are called ; 
they divide the feams of coal into feparate traefts, called fillers of coal, not unlike 
the fields or inclofures of a farm.
When a feam of coal is broken off by one of 
thefe dykes, the feam is thrown, as it is termed, confiderably upwards or down- 
wards : if it is to be found above, or upwards, then the dyke flopes from the per- 
pendicular, and rifes, inclining towards the horizon, from the end of the feam.
Where it is to be found downwards, the dykes flope from the perpendicular, in- 
clining the contrary way, or downwards, from the end of the feam ; indeed the 
faeft feems to be, that every feam in fuch a break, by fome convulfion in the earth 
has been thrown upwards: accordingly, when the feam is found below the one 
which has been wrought, the wrought feam appears to have been broken oft and 
thrown upwards from the one fought ; but w'hen the feam fought for is found up- 
wards, then it appears to have been thrown upwards from the feam already 
wrought.
Accordingly the flope always rifes from the lower feam, inclining from 
the perpendicular towards the feam thrown upwards.
The principal dykes run 
in a diredion nearly eaft and weft.
It is very expenfive to cut through thefe dykes, 
there 
WHITEHAVEN.
69 
there being often a confiderable thicknefs of Hone between one field of coal and 
another : the workmen fay, however, that thefe dykes are ufeful in preventing the 
water, or inflammable air, called the Datnp, flowing from any adjoining fields of 
coal, in which are no works carrying on, into another where men are working, till 
it is found convenient to cut through, or w'ork a new field.
Without thefe dykes, 
it w’ould be frequently very difficult to keep the works from being overcharged 
with water or inflammable air.
The w'orkmen fay, that the feams of coal keep always at equal diffances from 
each other, and all dip or defeend, doping nearly due weft, about one yard dip for 
ten in extent.
They further fay, that w here the covers or metals, as they call 
them, are light, or of little thicknefs, which is where the coals rife towards the fur- 
face, there they leave pillars feven or eight yards fquare, and the workings are 
from three to four yards wide; fo that about half the coal is taken away, and the 
other half is left to fupport the coverings.
But where the Team lies very deep, or 
far below the furface, and cfpecially w here the coal is draw n from under the fea, as 
it is in fome places to the diftance of eight or nine hundred yards, the pillars are 
left about eighteen yards fquare; and fo about one third part of the coal is taken, 
and two thirds are left.
Colliers who have w rought both at Whitehaven and Newcaftle fay, that the 
colliery at Whitehaven has much lefs W'ater according to the extent of the works, 
than the collieries about Newcaftle and other flat countries, where they cannot, by 
day levels, takeaway the top or furface fprings or feeds, according to thepradlice 
in Whitehaven.
The coal works here, how’ever, laying at a greater depth below 
the level of the fea, produce greater quantities of inflammable air, or damp, than 
any other colliery.
Both here, and about Newcaftle, little or no inflammable air 
exifts in the coal works above the level of the fea, except in the gut of the dykes 
before mentioned.
The quantity of inflammable air is generally in proportion to 
the depth of the w orks below the level of the fea.
There are near W’hitehaven, three holes, called Bear Mouths, through which 
the men and horfes go down to the coal works : they are called, Howgill Bear 
Moiiih, Gins Bear Mouth , and Greenhank Bear Mouth.
Through thefe fubterrane- - 
ous paffages, the men and horles go to the bottom.
In collieries where there are 
no fuch Bear Mouths, no horfes can be carried dow'n to work, but the coals are 
drawn under the ground by men.
In fuch places the workmen alfo are obliged 
to be let down the pits or ftiafts to their work, and to attend at the pit mouth at 
the hour appointed for that purpofe, or to lofe that day’s work, if they ftay after 
that time.
The late Sir James Lowther, who died in 1755, in order to improve the coal- 
works at Whitehaven, fent one Carlyle Spedding (who he knew to be a good en- 
gineer) to Newcaftle, to make all the difeoveries he could in the nature and 
management of the coal works there, in order to eftablifti and purfue the fame 
methods at Whitehaven.
In order to effed this, Mr. Spedding went to Newcaftle, 
where he got himfelf employed as a hewer (or hagger) of coals in the pits, under 
a fidicious name.
Here he ftaid fome time, making all the enquiries and difeo- 
veries w hich he poflibly could, relative to the conduding and management of the

•coal works there.
After continuing in that capacity for a confiderable time, he 
was unfortunately burnt by the fulminating damp there, which ufed to be fo in- 
jurious in the collieries at Newcaftle : when this happened, a mefiage was fent to 
New’caftle to procure the beft medical alTiftance poffible for Mr. Spedding, then 
knowm there by the name of Dan, in order to recover him.
The extraordinary attention paid to a perfon in the apparent fituation of Mr.
Spedding, by fuch eminent medical pradlitioners, led to a difeovery of Mr. Sped- 
ding’s intention: he therefore, when recovered, returned to Whitehaven, but for- 
tunately not before he had, in a great meafure, accompliflied the ends of his miffion.
When Mr. Spedding returned, he fet himfelf in earneft, under the patronage and 
at the expence ot Sir James Lowther, about improving the coal w'orks at White- 
haven, both by what he had feen, and what he invented himfelf.
* 
It is obferved to us by an indulgent correfpondent, that w hen Lord Lonfdale, 
the prefent proprietor, came into the pofleflion of the eftate at Whitehaven, in the 
year 1755, he feemed to be intent on extending the coal works, and promoting the 
trade and advantage of the inhabitants of the town of Whitehaven, by every means 
which he could devife.
Under his fpecial care, patronage, and protcdlion, the 
town increafed rapidly ; new houfes were eredled, ftrangers came to it to refidc 
from different parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland; fome to eftablifh and carry 
on manufa(flurcs, or foreign commerce ; others, to be employed as workmen 
and mechanics in the various works carried on there, and in the neighbourhood.
There was alfo a confiderable increafe of inhabitants, by an afflux of gentlemen of 
independent fortunes, of merchants, fhopkeepers, mechanics and labourers ; and 
alfo, of learned men in the feveral profefflons, there being at that time employ- 
ment and encouragement for every one ; genteel and rational entertainment and 
amufement for gentlemen ; commerce for the merchant, and plenty of work for 
the mechanic and labourer.
The trade of Whitehaven v/as extended to Africa, 
America, and almoft every commercial towm in Europe.
Nothing appeared to 
give more pleafure to the proprietor, than the flourifliing date and profperity of 
the town of Whitehaven : to promote this, he has expended feveral hundred 
thoufand pounds in the coal works, and other works in and near the town,|

Such a ilrain of rational piety feems to run through the following, that, we pre-

included in this Hiftory.
— In the original book of expences incurred in building 
St. Nicholas’s chapel, in Whitehaven, is 
A true copy of the inflrument figned by Sir John Lowther, Bart, and the 
" inhabitants of Whitehaven, for the building of a chapel there, as alfo of the 
“ agreement with Sir John Lowther, about the nomination of a minifler.” 
" Being fenfible of the great inconvenience which the inhabitants of the town of 
Whitehaven, and the flrangers reforting thither, do daily fuifer for w'ant of a 
chapel fufficicnt to receive all perfons to frequent divine fervice there, 
“ We, w hofe names are hereunto fubfcribed, out of a jufi: fenfe of our duty to 
ALMIGHTY GOD, and in all humble acknowledgment of his gracious bleflings 
upon the induflry of this place, to the great benefit of the adjacent country, do 
promife and engage to pay, towards the ereding of fuch a chapel as aforefaid, and 
for making the fame parochial, the feveral fums hereafter mentioned,” 
— Auguft 13th, 1687.
— I do agree that, upon the fettling of a fufficient fiipend 
upon the minifler, either by certain rates to be put upon the feats, or otherwife, 
that of the two perfons to be named by the inhabitants, I and my heirs will 
conftantly prefent one of the faid two perfons to the bifhop, to be the minifler.” 
To the above is annexed the fignature of Sir John Lowther, Bart, and his 
fubfcription is certified at two hundred pounds.
— Then follow the names and 
fubfcriptions of fixty-three other perfons.
The fir fl item of charge for the building is dated the 29th of the fame month*' 
and the w ork appears to have been carried on with great fpirit, the times and 
circumftances confidered, to the 23d of November, in the following year, 1688 ; 
when, probably on account of the diflurbances at that period, the bufinefs ceafed, 
after (as the book of accounts exprefles it) " having completed the weft gavel-end* 
“ and the ffeeple to the height of the fame.” 
After clofing the accounts for fo much of the work, we find the following 
memorandum : 
“ In the year 1691, the book and papers kept by Mr. Roger Strickland, rela- 
“ ting to the church, were put into my hands, after the building had flood fome 
years expofed to all weathers, and many other inconveniences; and at the defire 
“ of the truflees, and many of my neighbours, I was prevailed with to carry on 
“ the work.

Accordingly the next item of charge is dated the 12 th of July, 1691, nearly four 
years after the building had been begun.
— It was in a flate proper to be confecrated 
on the 1 6th of July, 1693, at which date we find an item of account of “ fix

At that period, the wages of a carpenter were one (hilling per day, and thofe of a 
labourer, lixpence.
— The cartage of (tones, five farthings per load, for what would 
now be charged eight-pence ; — and, it is alfo faid, that during the building of this 
church, the ma(ters of velTels on their arrival from fea, after the necelTary buHnefs 
of their (hips was difpatched, fent their apprentices to aitift at the work, as 
labourers, for which they were only to receive one-penny per day.
Several of the 
feamen alfo, during (uch leifure, lent their aid ; — but their recompence was only a 
moderate quantity of ale and tobacco ; for which latter article feveral fmall charges 
appear in the accounts.
— The whole expence was 1066I.
i6s.
2:|d.
— including 
73I, incurred in foliciting a parilh-bill, in which (it appears) the inhabitants had 
not been fuccefsful.
The juft fymmetry of this chapel is generally allowed ; ereeftions in this ftylc 
w'ere very rare in the north of England, at the time this was opened ; and the 
inhabitants were probably flattered by the approbation which they frequently heard 
ftrangers beftow upon their labours.
Hitherto they had only furnilhed the fteeplc 
with a bell and a clock ; the former was brought from Dublin ; the latter was the 
\vorkman(hip of one Andrew Pellin, an inhabitant of the town; and a very humble 
piece of mechanifm.
The infide of the church had then received no decoration.
However it happened that a young artift from London, (Mr. Matthias Reed) 
who had been engaged by one of the captains in King William’s fleet, after the 
difturbanccs were quelled in Ireland, returning from thence byway of Whitehaven, 
was retained by Sir John Lowther, to paint fome hiftorical pieces in the apartments 
of the Flat-Hall, or Caftle.
His produ(flions there excited a ftrong defire in the principal inhabitants 
to have his pencil employed in fome fuitable ornament for their new chapel: and, 
in the end, he was engaged to furni(h it with an altar-piece : which he executed 
highly to their fatisfadion.
The fubjeeft: is the Last Supper ; and it is no mean 
performance.
Reed became celebrated for his abilities, and bufinefs flowed in upon him fo 
abundantly, that he was induced to fettle in the town ; and, in the courfe of a 
long life, he painted more, perhaps, than any other artift in his time, and in a 
ftyle certainly fomething above mediocrity.
Many refpecftable teftimonies of his 
abilities as a copyift are to be feen in this town and the neighbouring houfes of the 
principal families.
It is worthy o( obfervation, that he eftimated his labours at 
merely thrice the rate of an ordinary mechanic, — was indefatigable in his pro- 
feffion, — and died rich.
Some years after the altar-piece had been placed in the chapel, the fame artift 
was employed to furni(h it with two companions, and he accordingly painted two 
very good figures of Mefes and Aaroity each of them larger than the life; which 
were placed on each fide of the altar-piece, under the galleries, to make the view 
from the principal entrance (by the weft-door) more complete.
After fome time, a little more ornament was thrown in, by fu(pending from the 
ceiling of the middle aile two very handfome brafs chandeliers : and, in the year 
1756, the chapel was furnifhed with an excellent, fine-toned organ, built by that 
celebrated artift, Snetzler, The organ, contrary to the ufual cuftom, is placed above

the altar ; neceffity obliging it to be fixed in that quarter, the owners of the pews 
on the oppofite gallery rcfuling to part with their property on any terms that could 
be offered : but the inltrument was no fooner up, than all eyes acknowledged the 
fuperior advantage of its fitaation ; the view, on the entrance into the chapel, 
being greatly enriched by it : — indeed it is generally allowed, that the approach from 
the weft-door, through the veftibule, is ftrikingly pleafing; — the chandeliers, the 
defks and pulpit, the altar, the ranging of the galleries, and the organ towering 
above all, form a coup-d'oeil^ at once folemn and beautiful; and efpecially w'hen the 
chandeliers are lighted, which is conftantly done, wdth wax, during the Sunday 
evening-fervice in winter.
The oppofite end prefents, in the centre, a well-proportioned arched door-cafe, 
above which, in the front of the lower gallery, (for there are tw'o galleries fronting 
the altar) is a handfome piece of carving, the kmg's arms, gilt ; and at each extre- 
mity of the upper gallery, is a label, curtained ; on one fide, Hoxv awful is this 
place !
fnrely this is none other than the houfe of God !” — on the other fide, “ Is it time 
for you, Oye, to dwell in your ceiled houfes, and this houfe lie wajie This latter is faid 
to allude to the defolate ftate of the chapel during the fufpenfion above noticed.
There is a report, generally credited, that the king’s arms, already mentioned, 
formerly belonged to the cuftom-houfe, and wert borrowed to decorate the church 
on fome occafion when it was vifited by the bifhop of the diocefe: — but the chapel- 
W’ardens being changed about that time, the new officers were not acquainted with 
this tranfadtion of their predeceffbrs, and pofitively refufed to part with any 
fixture of the church.
In this chapel, the ecclefiaftical courts are held twice in the year, for the 
diftridl ; and the Bifhop of Chefter vifits his clergy in it, holds confirmations, See.
— It was new-painted and beautified in 1786, the old clock replaced by a new one 
in 1787 ; a veftry-room W'as added to the building, and feveral other improvements 
were made in the church and burying-ground.
We have been the more particular in our defeription of this chapel, confidering it 
as a monument of the great exertions and pious difpofition of the early inhabitants 
of this town; whofe fpirit indeed has been great, if we confider the poor and infig- 
nificant ftate from whence their town was only then emerging, and the numerous 
difficulties they muft have laboured under on account of their remotenefs from any 
place where they could be fupplied with artificers and various articles neceflary for 
the profecution of fuch a deiign: for, at that time, the employments of therefident 
inhabitants muft have been almoft wholly confined to the fhipping.
Whilft we 
offer this tribute of pofthumous praife to the original fettlers, (for, till about the 
period alluded to, Whitehaven* could hardly rank as a town) it would be unjuft to 
the charader of their fucceffors not to add that, in this refpedl:, they prove them- 
felves not unworthy their anceftry.

* Mr. Gough, in his Additions to the lafl, edition of Camden, fpeaking of Whitehaven, fays,— “ It 
contains 1 200 inhabitants, and has 1 90 great fhips, moftly employed in the coal trade, three chapels, 
“ four meeting-houfes, and a good artificial harbour, with a long pier.
The collieries lie at the foot of 
“ a hill eighty fathoms deep, by an eafy defeent, bricked and vaulted.” He then proceeds with a further 
account totally contradidlory to the preceding paragraph, and then fays — “ Here are three ftrata of 
“ coal, at a confiderable diftance one above another, but not always regular, being interfperfed with 
“ breaks of hard rock, called eljkej,’*

The town of Whitehaven is now ( 1795) incorporated as to all concerns relative 
to its poor, under the amended a(fl of parliament ; — and the building above men- 
tioned is accordingly to be extended, and improved.
The plan is already formed, 
and the work let off to different tradefmen, under the management of the vifitor, 
committee, and guardian.
Here are two good Butchers Markets, (the fliambles occafionally locked up 
on the intermediate days) viz.
the New-Market ^ to which there is a paffage from!
King-ffreet, at one end, and into Chapel-ffreet, at the other: — on the oppolite fidcr

— This,

ropery^ 
WHITEHAVEN.

roperv, there was a ropery, acrofs the town, from north to fouth, in the place called 
George-Jireet ; — and the firll: manufadory of the kind was carried on in the place 
now called Roper-Jireety which extended from the market-place to where the ftreet 
is interfeded by ^leen-Jireet..
A houfe, which at prefent encroaches upon Roper- 
ftreet, and hurts the uniformity of it, at the corner of Coales- Laney was formerly 
called the rope-houfe.
— Confiderably more than its value has lately been offered for 
it, in order to widen that part of the ftreet, and to open a view from the market- 
place to Trinity church, which, is intercepted by the projedion of this building.
There are Carriers to and from Workington, Maryporr, Cockermouth, and 
Egremonr, three times a week; Carlifle and Wigton, once; Harrington, St. Bee’s, 
Kefwick, Kendal, and Penrith, twice ; Ulverfton and Broughton, once.
— By their 
correfpondence in their different journeys, goods are received (by land) twice a 
week from London, Birmingham, &c.
And there is a diligence once a week 
between Carlifle and this place.
The Cumberland Pacquet, a weekly newfpaper, w'as begun on the 20th of Od.
1774, and is continued with increafing credit, circulation, and correfpondence.
The only Packet-Boat, employed by government between Great Britain and 
the Ijle of Mann, fails from Whitehaven and Douglas, weekly.
— It was eftablifhed 
in 1766.
— The packet is appointed to leave Whitehaven the firfl tide after the 
arrival of the Saturday’s pofl: from London, which is received on the Monday 
evening ; is to remain two days in the port of Douglas, in the Ifle of Mann, and 
then make her paffage to Whitehaven as fpeedily as circumflances will permit.-— 
There are frequently from 1 5 to 20 paffengers weekly by this veflel ; fometimes a 
much greater number.
The London poft arrives at Whitehaven every evening at feven, (Tuefday ex- 
cepted) and departs the fame night at a quarter part ten.
— But the general pofl: 
arrives and departs every night, at the fame hours.
— The poft from Ulverfton, in 
Lancafhire, was eftabliflied about five years ago; — it arrives on the evenings of 
Monday, Wednefday, and Saturday, and returns on the mornings of Tuefday, 
Friday, and Sunday.
There are fix Ship-Builders yards at Whitehaven; and it is not unufual to 
fee ten, or twelve, new veffels upon the flocks.
The reputation of the mafter- 
builders at this port is well known.
If proof were wanting, one might refer to 
Liverpool, where fuch numbers of the Whitehaven-built veffels are conftantly 
upon freight, and efpecially feleded for the tranfporting of dry cargoes.
We have 
nothing to do with the comparative merit of any place, or any fet of artificers; 
but w'e feel much fatisfadlion in paying a fmall tribute of refpetft to the acknow- 
ledged merits of this ufeful, this important clafs of mechanics, profecuting their 
bufinefs at Whitehaven, with a zeal for improvement, and an induftry feldom 
feparated from real genius ; and, we may add, with an approbation which cannot 
fail of promoting their intereft and charadler, as the fpecimens of their art become 
more widely differhinated.
It may be proper to obferve, that the firft charafferiftic of the Whitehaven 
ftiip-building is frengtb : — in this particular, the veffels are faid to excel all others.

architecture.
The art of happily combining all thefe properties^ foas to produce 
a MACHINE the moft ufeful m navigation, is undoubtedly the ne plus ultra of the 
icience;— and, perhaps, the building-yards of Whitehaven (in proportion) furnifh 
more iniianccs of fuch combination than can clfewhere be met with.
It will appear fornewhat extraordinary, that in a place of fuch great refort for 
Jbipping, there fliould not have been any manufactory for Sail-Cloth here —One 
would fuppofe that the continual and arrivals of veflels at Whitehaven and 
Ks mender-ports, viz.
Harrington, Workington, and Maryport,* (all within a 
Imall diltance) would much earlier have prompted fome qualified perfon, or com- 
pany, to undertake the manufacture of an article for which there is lo great a 
demand .
For in very few parts of this kingdom is there fo great an accumulation 
^Uonnage to be found, as between Whitehaven Old Quay, and the northern picC 
or Maryport ; a range of coafl: not exceeding twelve miles.
No attempt of this kind was made till the year 1786, when a manufactory on 
a very extenfive fcale, was begun by fome gentlemen from Lancafhire, experienced 
in that branch.

The undertakers have alfo ereCted another very extenfive building at Cortickle 
and improved and enlarged the buildings at Low-Mill, near Egremont, which

Some hun.ireds of people are conftantly employed, in the different 
departments of this manufaiftory ; and the cffecls of the eflablifhment fpread into 
various channels, certainly advantageous, in a very confidcrable degree, to that com- 
merce for which the genius and perfeverance of this nation are fo juftly erninent.f 
The Sail-Cloth Manufactory at Whitehaven is the moft prominent feature 
of its internal trade; as it is, elfentially, the greatclf acquifition to the flaple con-4 
cerns of the place that has been gained for almolf half a century.

It is worthy of fome remark, that a veffel belonging to that houfe, called the Mally, (and commanded 
by Mr. Samuel Mitchinson, a native of Carlifle, or its neighbourhood) landed the laft cargo in Vir- 
ginia whilft that Hate remained a meniber of the BritKh empire.
She alfo brought off the firft cargo!
under the export declaration and agreement of the affoclation, and the laft cargo within the time allowed 
for fuch exports.* 
In thecourfe of this bufinefs, the MallY (IHll under the command of Captain Mitchinfon J croffed the*

Relative to this fingular inftance of quick, commercial navigation, we find the following paragraph in’ 
the Cuttiherland Pacquet of the 14th of December, 1775 ; which paper (the reader will alfo obferve)

The veflel was equipped at Nantes, for this expedition — He was a native of Galloway, and ferved hii

Before any force could be collefted, “Jones and his crew had re -embarked In two boats, and all the guns 
of the nearell battery were found fpiked.
Three of them were, however, foon cleared, and feveral (hots 
were fired, a few of which were obferved to fall between the two boats ; but not to take effedl.

James Speddjng, Efq. was many years principal engineer and fteward to the late Sir William 
Lowther, Bart, and to his fuccelTor, the prefent Earl of Lonfdale.
To the employment of an engineer, he 
was introduced at a very early age, and fucceeded his father (Carlifle Spedding, Efq.) In the management 
of the Whitehaven collieries, in Auguft, 1755.
Afterwards, on the death of his uncle (John Spedding, 
Efq.) he was appointed fteward ; uniting two offices and duties of the greateft importance in this part 
of the kingdom.
In his conduct as fteward he difplayed great integrity, prudence, and humanity.
In 
his duty as an engineer, the many maftetly produdlions of his genius, by w'hich the Whitehaven coal- 
works have been improved and extended, will long remain a monument of his fuperior (leill, and unwearied 
application.
He was the laft of a family who had rendered themfelves eminent by equal induftry and 
ingenuity, and of whofe great attainments in philofophy, the moft fcientific men, in the courfe of the lall 
feventy years, have given repeated and ample teftimony.
To that knowledge, the refult of long experi-

The late Anthony Bacon, Efq. of London, who was a native of this place, is one inftance, among 
many that might be named in the commercial world, to Ihew how a man of good abilities may, by exer- 
tion and application, from almoft any ftation, rife to diftinftion and eminence.
"When he was more than 
thirty years of age, with his great talents, and, we may add, great fuccefs, he was ftill but the mailer o£ 
a veffel employed in the tobacco trade from this port : and yet he lived to be, for many years, one of the 
firfl merchants in our modern Tyre, the city of London, (whofe merchants, like thofc of Tyre of old, 
arc literally princes) and had a feat in the Houfe of Commons for three fuccefiive paillaments.
Mr. Bacon poflefled an aftive, vigorous mind ; but his forte feemed to lie in a certain refolute, though 
temperate, ardency of fpirit, which aroufed and called into aftion all his bell faculties in moments of 
difficulty and danger, when men of ordinary minds are apt co defpond and give up every thing for loft.
Profperity always threw him oft" his guard, and thence he feemed to lofe all his ftrength ; but no fooner 
was he befet with dilHciilties and diftreffes, as was frequently the cafe, than he role with recruited vigour 
and extricated himfelf.
Once at leaft, if not oftner, his creditors were called together and his books, 
(hewn ; and he has been heard to declare, that feveral times, even in the apparent zenith of his profperity, 
had the fame thing then happened to him, he would have been found worfe than nothing.
This inftance,.
among many others that might be produced, proves that, if the vilionary piojeft of fome romantic poli- 
ticians ftiould take place, of obliging every man to difclofc the true ftate of his aftalrs, that monied as well 
as landed property might be taxed, it would be highly injurious to commerce, and oftentimes fatal.
Mr. Bacon lived to get through all his prefling pecuniary difficulties ; and died, four or five years ago, 
pot only in high credit, but in the pofleffion of a large fortune.
A confiderable part of this fortune 
confifts in a colliery near Workingte >1, and in fome extenfive iron-works in Glamorgan (hire.
Thefe are 
ftill carried on with great fuccefs ; the manufadlure of iron in this kingdom, as well as the importation of 
It from foreign countries, having lately increafed to a degree which, a few years ago,' would have been 
thought Impoffible.
That particular names, either chrlftian or furnames, are at all material, or of moment, in life, has 
generally been fet down as the playRil idea only of a late humorous writer; yet matters of fa<ft frequently 
occur in real life, which ftiew that it is not quite an indifferent circumftance.
We ate far from taking 
upon us to affert, that there never was, or Is, an ordinary perfon of the name of Bacon ; but we appeal 
to the Hiftory of England as a vtmeher, that there have been many extraordinary perfons of that name.
The above-mentioned Mr. Bacon had a brother whofe charaftcr was as ftriking, and whofe life was as 
eventful — as his own ; both the one and the other poffeffed talents and abilities — and (truth compels us 
to add) indiferetions alfo, hardly inferior to their great namefake Lord Verulam.-— — Bioo.

Moore, Hamilton, Harrifon, Serjeant, and Co.
About two o'clock, on Monday the 31ft of Januaiy, 179T, in the afternoon, the ground fuddenly 
fhrunk, in the garden of H.
Littledale, Efq. behind his houl'e, in Duke-ftreet, and the noife of fubter- 
ranean waters was heard on the fpot, by a fervant there at work.
— Near the fame time, the ground funk 
in a garden behind the houfe once occupied for the Difpenfary, in Scotch-ftreet, and in the burial-ground 
behind the Anabaptifts meeting-houfe, in Charles-llreet, all on the north fide of the town.
This event created much alarm, as it was evident it proceeded from the falling in of fome of the old 
coal-works ; and it afterwards appeared, that a great difeharge of water had flowed in upon the working 
pits, and two men and a woman, with five horfes, were drowned in the works.

Pacq.
On Wednefday evening, another plot of ground funk, within a few yards of the former fetling, in Mr.
Littledale’s garden ; and other finkings, though much more trivial, were obferved in different places.— 
This accident was attributed to a workman in a new drift unfortunately ftriking into a drowned wafl;e, 
or old working.
Several workmen and horfes were faved from the fate of the others, by remaining in 
their workings till the water ran off, which was in about two hours after its old lodgment had been 
pierced.
Ibid, ^th Feb.
The number of houfes which were, in a manner, demolifhed by thofe finkings, amounted to 18, among 
which was Mr. Littledale’s elegant manfion ; — and between 60 and 80 families deferted that part of the

area lies to the weft and fouth-weft of the church, a fquare of one hundred and 
twenty paces, with the ufual obtufe angles; it conftfts of an elevated plain of 
ground, clofe upon the brink of the fea banks; commanding a large traeft of fhorc, 
and many creeks now frequented by fmall craft.
Some few paces from the weft- 
agger of this ftation, the fea banks being lofty, form a natural half-moon, and 
defeend precipitately to the beach.
The weft-agger is very confpicuous and lofty, 
the fouthern one is on the edge of a high ridge, and diftineft ; the ftones and mor- 
tar in many parts breaking through the turf.
The eaft-agger is but low, but very 
obfervable; and the ditch is alio difcernable: the northern-agger is much defaced 
by building the church and fencing in the burial ground.
The interior part of the 
ftation has long been cultivated, and forms a beautiful field; which has no other 
fencing to the fouth, than what is formed by the agger.
It is obfervable, that the lituation of Morefby and Elenborough, on the fouthern 
banks of a bay for lliipping, on the mouth of a little river, points out in a moft 
The originals of thofe infcriptions, what Camden has given us, I could not difeover; no doubt fince 
his time they are loft, or deftroyed.
It is hard to know what to make of the laft infeription, fince the former part Is wanting.
It feems as 
if fomc edi.fice had been built or repaired, to which It has a reference; and the feventh Cohort, mentioned 
before, which moft probably was of the 20lh legion detached from Chefter, might be employed In this 
work, and Severinus have the charge of it: but this is uncertain.
As for the altar inferi'oed to th.e god Silvanus, by the Colors fecur.da Lmgonum, there is no difficulty 
In it, except in the fourth line at the end, and the M there muft either have been another name of the 
commander, or elfe there may have been an F after It, for Marci filius.
Mr, Horfley adds, “ Arbeia appears to me to have been the moft northeily of the ftat’ons, which w-ere

fouthern part of Yorkftilre, the Ihtitia fets down thofe which were garrifjned by feveral numeri; and

Camden, from aflinity of names, takes this for Ireby in Cumberland; but 
as there are no remains of a ftation at Ireby, fo I could never learn upon enquii-y, that there were any 
other Roman antiquities fo-and there : and the argument from affinity of names Is of lefs force, becaufe 
there is another place of the fame name in Lancafttire.

G ave name to the rcfident family.
— ** Lamplugh in the fells, is that manor- 
“ houfe and feignory in the barony of Egremont, which gave name to the 
ancient family of Lamplughs ; a race of valourous gentlemen fucceflively, for 
their worthynefs knyghted in the field, all or mofi: of them.
They bear for 
arms, a fable crofs batany flurte, in a field d’Or. Their iflue male enjoyed the 
** fame from the conquefi, or near that time, to this day.
The firfi: Lord of Lam- 
plugh that I read of, was William de Lancaftre, who exchanged Workington 
and Lamplugh with Gofpatric, the fonc of Orme, Lord of Seaton, beneath Dar- 
went, for Middleton in Lonfdale.
This William de Lancaftre was a great baron, 
« his lands lay about Kendale, in Weftmoreland : he was a great commander 
under Henry 11.
in the wars againft David of Scotland ; and Earl Henry, his 
<* fon, in thefe parts, and helped to recover the counties of Cumberland and Nnr- 
thumberland, from the Scots, which King Stephen had given them.
By that 
exchange, Lamplugh became the Lord of Seaton’s lands.
The faid Gofpatric 
held it all his time ; but after his death, his fon Thomas gave it to one Robert 
“ Lamplugh and his heirs, for paying yearly a pair of gilt fpurs to the Lord of 
Workington.
This Robert held it in Henry IPs. time, and when Richard 1.
reigned.
After Robert’s death, it defeended to Adam, his fon, in King John’s 
time ; to which Adam, Richard dc Lucy, then Lord of Egremont, and all Cope- 
land, as Lord Paramount of Lamplugh, confirmed the fame and other things, as 
“ Murton and Arlochden, unto him and his heirs, with divers immunities.
After 
Adam, it defeended according to the following pedigree unto John Lamplugh,

PARISH OF LAMPLUGH.
The demcfne is extcnfive, and in the eallern parts is very mountainous, but 
affords fine fheep walks.
The little townfhips of Kellon and Murton are within this parifli.
Kelton was 
anciently united to Lamplugh, but was fevered by Kctel, fon of Ivo de Tailbois, 
firft Baron of Kendal.
Mr. Denton’s account is as follows ; “ Kelton, or Ketlcton, villa Ketelli, was 
firfl: a parcel of Lamplugh, and made a village by Ketellus, the fon of Eldred, 
*• and Saltre, the capital meffuage and demefne there, was afterwards given by 
Gofpatrick, the fon of Orme, the fon of Ketell, to the abbey of York, in frank 
alms.
The abbot made Saltre a part of the cell of but Kelton continued 
always a lay-fee, and is the inheritance of one Moorhoufe, grandchild to 
wife to Moorhoufe, fome time laundrefs to Queen Mary, excepting all bells, and 
all the lead in the premifes, (not in gutters or wdndows) and all advowTons, &c.
who gave Kelton to them and their heirs male.
It cfcheated to the crown for 
want of iffue in the Lord Marquis of Northampton.
William Parr, heir to the 
barons of Kendale, and to the Harringtons of Harrington ; and Adingham Parr 
was heir to the Marquis of Dorfct ; Gray, w'ho had right thereunto, by Cicely, 
“ the Lord William Boyvills daughter, and heir : her grandmother was daughter 
and heir to the Harringtons of Harrington.
Kelton was holden as a fee of 
Beckermit, until the lord paramount’s heirs (three coparceners.) Elizabeth, 
** daughter of Thomas Multon, transferred the feignory to Robert Harrington, 
and thereby extinguifned the menalty of the lordfliip of Beckermit.
At the 
furpreflion of abbies.
Dr. Lighe bought Saltre, and now Thomas Salkeld, bro- 
“ ther to Lancelot Salkeld, of the Whitehall, doth enjoy the fame by purchafe 
“ from Henry Lighe, fon to Thomas, fon to William, brother to the Dodtor.” 
The capital houfe of Sal/er was given by Gofpatric, fon of Orme, to the abbey 
of St. Mary, York, and it W'as configned to the cell of St. Bees.
After the difib- 
lution, it was granted to the Leighs, and by that family was fold to the Salkelds of 
White-hall : being given in dow ry with Catharine Salkeld, to Jofeph Patrickfon.
Salter-hall pafled from the Patrickfons to the family of Robertfons of Clearer, 
who, in 1633, fold the fame to Mr. William Fryer, from whom it dcfcended to 
Parceners, his two daughters.
Frances married Mr. John Dickenfon of Street- 
gate, in Lamplugh ; and Mary married the Rev. John Baxter, minifter of Arlec- 
den, between w hom partition was made, and the moiety, including the manfion- 
houfe, which was afiigned to Mrs. Dickinfon, defeended to Mr. Daniel Dickinfon 
her eldeft fon, an attorney at law in Ulverfion ; and Mrs. Baxter pofielfes the other 
moiety.
The manfion-houfe was built by Thomas Salkeld in 1586, as appears 
by an infeription over the front door.
The demefne is not in the parilh of Lam- 
plugh, but is extraparochial.
Murton is held of the honor of Egremont, and being united with the manor, 
remains the eftate of the Lamplughs.
This place gave name to a refident family, 
who polfefi'ed it for feveral generations.
It came into the pofTeflion of the Lam- 
plughs in the time of King Edward 11 .
as appears by the efeheats of that reign.

"T^ISTINGTON, villa ad pratim Dijling^ lies between Harrington and 
** jL^ Morefby : it is fo called of the low wet meadow grounds there, and was the 
“ inheritance of Sir Gilbert, the fon of Gilbert de Dundraw, Knight, (who was 
fon to Odard Lord of Wigton barony, called Odardus de Logis.) He lived in 
“ King Richard I.
and King John’s time, and was Lord of Diltington, Dundraw, 
and Crofton.
He gave lands to the abbey of Holm Cultram and the priory of 
Carlifle in Diftington and Crofton.
He had iffue Ifolda, wife to Adam de 
Tinmow.
They gave the fourth part of Diflington and the advowfon of the 
“ redory to Thomas, the fon of Lambert de Multon, am.

The manfion-houfe is in ruins ; the remains

Camden fays — “ Nor mufl 1 omit the mention of Hay 
“ Caflle, which I faw in the neighbourhood; very venerable for its antiquity; and 
“ which the inhabitants told me belonged formerly to the noble families of Morefby 
“ and Diffington.” This old manfion, by the appearance of its prefent remains, 
feems to be of antiquity equal to the time of Gilbert de Dundraw: a gloomy old tow'er, 
on an artificial mount, furrounded with an outward or curtain wall, fupported by 
many heavy buttreffes, and ftrengthened with a moat.
It is pretty well afeertained,

THE PARISH OF HARRINGTON 
( IN ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT ) 
E xtends along the fea coafl: ; on the land fide, it is watered by the little 
river Wyre.
This was part of the pofleOions of the family of Tailbois, and 
held by them of the fee of Workington.
The refident family alTumed a local 
name, and from that flock feveral confidcrable families were derived.
“ Haverington, now Harrington, lies between Diftington and Workington, 
** and was at the conqued parcel 1 of the inheritance of...
Lord of and 
** is holden of Workington.
This place gave name to the firft of the ancient fa- 
“ mily of Harringtons, als.
Haveringtons, of which houfe there fprung divers 
“ families, as that of Wethcrllack, of Addingham, in Furnefs, in Lancafhire, of 
Beamont, in Cumberland, and one in Rutlandfhire.
The eldeft were Lords of 
“ Harrington, and married the heir general de Sanguine, of Seaton, and there- 
“ fore confirmed Flemingby to the abbey of Holm Cultram; but he got not the 
lordfliip of Seaton, for his wife died in the grandfather’s rime, who gave the 
“ land to her uncle Patrick de Culwen.
Afterwards he married Ellena, the 
fifler and heir of William Cancepfield, whofe father, Richard Cancepfield, mar- 
ried Alicia, the daughter and heir of William, and filler and heir of Michael 
Fleming, of Adingham, in King Henry Ill.’s time.
And in King Edward Ill.’s 
" time, they married with the third coheir of John de Multon, Lord of Egremont; 
** and, at the lafl, a daughter transferred the inheritance to the Bonvills, whofe 
daughter Cicily in like fort did the fame with the Bonvills’ lands to Thomas 
“ Gray, fon of John Marquis of Dorfet.
They held it three defeents; and, laflly, it 
“ fell to the crown by efeheat from the death of William Parr, Marquis of 
Northampton.
— Another Harrington married the daughter and one of the two 
“ coheirs of Baflingthw'aitc, whofe lafl rebelled with Martin Thw^arth.

The foil of the improved common lands is in general lhallow and cold in culture, turning up 
a whitilh poor clay, naturally barren ; but by flcilful management rended tolerably produdtive.
All forts 
of grain is grown here, but principally oats.
A large portion of land is kept in grading for meadow and 
pafture, as many horfes are employed in the carriages for conveying lime and coals to the harbour.
This

the town and harbour, where the ground finks into narrow valleys or gills ; the coall is high, prominent, 
and rocky.
Scarce a tree is to be feen, fo that the country has a bare appearance.
The harbour is 
modern and well conftrufted.

— “ Brigham villa ad Potitem was one of the five towns which 
^ William Mefchincs, Lord of Copeland, gave to Waldeof, Lord of Allcrdale, at

Mathilda his fifter.
After fome tew defcents, it fell to fifters; for in the 40th

— Not many flieep are kept ; they have decreafed greatly of late, and, it is con- 
ceived, not above 400 or 500 are remaining.
Soil and Produce.] The foil is various, but generally between a loam and a gravel, and is fertile 
in the produdlion of all forts of grain and roots.
— Few turnips are grown, which, in this fituation, is a 
great negledl in hulbandry, as both foil and climate feem to favour that cultivation.
Some wet, clay 
land lies diftant from the town.
Fuel.] Coal.
Mines and Minerals.] Plenty of limeftone at Dean, Deaiifcales, and Pardfey : quarries of white

Antiquities.] At Parkhill, a field adjoining to Dean, are two artificial hillocks, covered with turf,

Aspect and General Appearance.] As to the adjacent parifties.
Dean is in a lowfituation, and 
the land is level ; It lies higheft towards the confines.
Although here is little wood, the hedge-row 
trees make a chcarful variety, the fields arc regular, the roads and buildings arc good, and on the whole 
this parlfti is much pleafanter than the furrounding ones.
The hulbaiidmen are In a great error in laying 
down their lands without manure and feeds ; fo that they continue long of little value, and are commonly 
covered with reddifh mofs, a bad herbage, and noxious weeds.— Kousman’s Notis.

Gilbert Huthwaite held the moiety of Brigham ; and after that the

The other moiety defeended from Walter Twinham to Adam 
Twinham his fon, who died feized thereof 35th Edward I.
And Walter, the 
" fon of Adam Twinham, gave the redlory by fine unto John Harcla and his heirs

And by the attainder of Andrew Harcla, Earl of Carlifle, the 
rectory was feized to the king, though he flood feized in truft to the ufe of Henry 
Harcla, fon and heir to John Harcla.” Denton’s MS.
After falling to coheirefles, in feveral divifions and changes of proprietors, one 
moiety was vefted in the Sw inburns, and the other in the Twinhams.
One of this 
latter named family endowed a chauntry, which he founded in Brigham church 
with his moiety; and, on the diffolution, it was granted out to the Fletchers of 
Morefby, who infranchifed the tenants.
Swinburn’s moiety flill remains of 
cuftomary tenure, fubjeifl: to arbitrary fines.§ In the 13th year of King Edward II.
the redlory being veiled in Harcla Earl of Carlifle, on his attainder was feized 
by the crown, though it is faid the earl only had it in truft.
How the crown 
difpofed of it, is not fliewn by any evidence we have met with, but it appears that 
it was foon afterwards given to the collegiate church of Staindrop, in the county 
of Durham, and was made appropriate in the year 1439.

COCKERMOUTH.
The eye, after having run over a variety of pleafing objeds, now viewed this 
ancient town with no fmall degree of delight.
The caflle appeared on our 
approach, crowning an eminence on the left, the church on the right, between 
VI hich lay the road into the town.
— " Cokermuth, a market town, ftanding on the 
” wefl: fide of Derwent, four or five miles from the fe fhore, and 20 from Carluel.”K 
Mr. Gough, in his Additions to Camden, fays — “ It is a large borough town, 
with broad ffreets, wafhed by the river Derwent, and divided by the Cocker, at 
“ w'hofe mouth it ftands ; the inhabitants amount to 3 or 4000, the manufadlory 
" is fhalloons, worffed ftockings, and hats.
The cafile, built by Waltheof, firft 
“ Lord of Allendale, and fon of Gofpatric, Earl of Northumberland, temp.
conq.
or by William de Mefehines, Lord of the honour of Cockermouth, ftands on an 
" artificial hill, is fquare, and has feveral towers.
On each fide the fecond gate 
” two fpacious dungeons.
It was burnt in the civil war.* The town gives title 
of Vifcount to the Earl of Egremont, to w hom the cafile came by the Percies as 
to them from the Lucies and Pipards.f 
On our firft entrance, the town-houfe, with the adjoining buildings, prejudiced 
us with an immediate idea that here we fhould find no other than the marks of 
decayed grandeur: but we were agreeably difappointed.
“ 1 he Earl Randolph Mefehines gave to Waldeof, the fon of Gofpatrick, Earl 
of Dunbar, in Scotland, the great barony of AllerdalCy which lies between the 
** rivers of Darwent and Wampool, on the fouth and north parts, and on the w’efi:

“ falleth down northward into Wathempole, or Wampool, from Caldbeck, and on 
the other fide of the hill by Rowdand beck, which falleth fouthward into Cald-

“ which river, defeending between it and Caftle-Sowerby, and the barony of 
** Grcyftock keeps them afunder there on the eaft fide of the mountain Carrock 
and Gryfedale fells.
" It is called Allerdale of the river Alne.
It was antiently writ Aln-er-dale^

“ Finally he died without ilTue male, therefore his nephew, William Fitz Duncan, 
“ Earl of Murray, fucceeded him in his inheritance.
— William Romley, (called

of Cockermouth, Afpatrick, and Allerdale, by the faid King Henry, and after-

But becaufe the Barony of Egremont 
" was lelTer in value than Allerdale, Reginald Lucy had lome part of the barony 
“ of Allerdale, (after the death of William Fitz Duncan) but dame Alice Romley* 
“ his wife’s filler, was the chief lady of the feignory.
“ Alice Romley, the third daughter and coheir of William Fitz Duncan, wa 
“ therefore the fourth Lady of Allerdale : but having no children alive at her death 
Ihe gave av\ay divers manors and lands to houfes of religion, and to her friends 
“ and kinl'men.
She had a fon, named William, who was drowned in Craven 
coming home from hunting or hawking.
His hound or fpaniel being tied to 
'' his girdle by a line, (as they crofTed the water near Bardon Tower, in Craven) 
“ pulled his mailer from off his horfe and drowned him.
When the report of the

“ unmarried, and without children; wherefore the inheritance was after her death 
“ parted between the houfe of Albemari and Reginald Lucy, Baron of Egremont, 
defeending to her filler’s children and their pofterity.
A moiety of the barony

Cockermouth is a chapelry in the parifh of Brigham.
It ffands at the mouth 
of the river Cocker, from whence the name is derived.
The town lies upon both 
banks of the river, with a communication by a bridge.
The river Derwent 
waffles the w'effern foot of the eminence on which the caftle is built, and at its 
fouthern point receives the Cocker.
Camden, deferibing this place, faysf — 
“ From thence (Kefwick) the Derwent, fometimes broad and fometimes narrovi', 
rolls on to the north in great haffe, to receive the river Cocker, which two 
“ rivers, at their meeting, do almoft furround Cockermouth, a populous, well- 
traded market-town, where is a caftle (heretofore of the Earls of Northumber- 
land, &c.) It is a town neatly built, but of a low fituation, between two hills, 
“ upon one is the church, and upon the other overagainft it (which is evidently 
“ artificial) a very ftrong caftle, on the gates whereof are the arms of Moltons, 
Umframvills, Lucies, and Percies; and, for the better profpect of which, the 
forementioned mount was raifed.” 
The houfes form two ftreets, in an angular figure, from the bend of which runs 
out the fhort ftreet that leads to the caftle.
One of thefe chief ftreets ftands above 
the river Cocker, in which are the moot-hall, market-houfe, and fhambles, which 
have a gloomy and antique appeaiance.
Thefe eredlions are in general great 
obftacles and difagreeable objeefts in our northern towns : they are without excep- 
tion dirty and unwholefome.
Thefe at Cockermouth are not fo great a nuifance 
as others W’e have feen, but yet are difgufting, and an annoyance as well to the

This is a very ancient borough, and fent members to parliament in the 23d 
year of the reign of King Edward I.* It difeontinued this franchife for feveral 
centuries.
'I he firfl: regular returns we find in modern times proceed from the

The eledtion is by inhabitants having burgage tenure, who are about 
three hundred in number; and the baililf of the borough is returning officer.
He 
is chofen yearly at Michaelmas out of the burghers, by the jury of the Leet^ which 
is compoled of burghers, and forms a fpecial jury for the government of the 
borough, at the court then held for the borough : and, being head officer within 
the town, he executes the duty of clerk of the market, which, by cuftom, is 
annexed to his bailiwick.
I'hc Earl of Egremont holds his courts of audit in the caflle here; and, having 
many manors of cuflomary tenure, he appoints the government thereof to be in

Beffdes the court of audit, the ffeward holds a leet for the honour, to which the 
five towns and manor of Derwent fells are amenable, and feparate juries are charged 
for the liberties of the borough, for the five towns jointly, and for Derwent fells.
The ffreet afcending to the caftle, although not commodious from its fteepnefs, 
yet feems to be the favourite of people of fortune, containing many elegant 
houfesi.
THE CASTLE, 
now in ruins, except fome apartments at the gate, ffands at the confluence of the 
rivers Cocker and Derwent, on a fine eminence; the whole fortrefs forms an irre- 
gular fquare: in former ages this was a place of great extent and ftrength ; the 
entrance has been kept by a draw bridge and a deep ditch: the gateway tower is 
much more modern than any other part of the building; the gateway is vaulted 
with ribbed arches joining in the centre, and defended by maflive gates and a 
portcullis.
This tower is lofty, and commands a large profped;.
By this gate, 
from the north, we entered a fquare area, each fide being forty paces; from thence, 
by a much narrower gateway, we palTed into an inner area, around which the 
principal parts of this fortrefs ftand.
The fouth-weft front fiands on the brink of 
a precipice above the river Derwent; by removing the rubbifh on this fide, 
the form of the ancient ffrudures has in part been difcovered, and fhews that 
there had been a fpacious piazza, lighted by feveral large windows towards the 
river, which was the approach to the ftate room and other apartments in the great 
tower.
This piazza feems to have taken its form from the cliff, as it is almoft 
femicircular.
The angle which overlooks the confluence of the rivers is defended 
by a circular tower.
The fouth wall rifes from the brink of the eminence above 
the river Cocker ; is defended at intervals by a large exploratory tower and a fquare 
baftion, which command the town : the extremities of the wall are fortified with 
the circular tower before mentioned, and a fquare tower which forms part of the 
defence of the northern part of the fortrefs.
The north fide is defended by a moat, 
the wall is lofty and ftrengthened with a fquare baftion.
It is computed the 
walls are fix hundred yards in compafs.
On each fide of the gateway leading to 
the interior court, or area, is a dungeon, or vault, capable of containing forry or 
fifty perfons each : a fmall aperture is left in the crown of the arch, to let down 
the unhappy wretches who were doomed to the horrid cell ; on the fide of each 
is a flip, or loophole, whereby the provifions were conveyed with a rope to the 
miferable inhabitants.
Such feverities as the captives in war fuffered in ancient 
times, rendered the battles more bloody, as imprifonment was worfe than death; 
or rather fuch a doom might be called a lingering execution.
This was affliredly the baronial feat of the Lords of Allerdale; but authors 
differ much about the original founder, though all feem to agree that its date is

farms, mills, mines, quarries, rents, cuftoms, duties, and fei vices ariling from them.

COCKERMOUTH.
but a few years pofterior to the conqueft.
By fome we are told that it owed its 
origin to Waldeof, firfl- Lord of Allerdale below Derwent, and fon of Gofpatric, 
whofe firft refidence was at Papcaftle, but preferring this fituation, removed hither.
By others we are told that this caflle was built foon after the conqueft by William 
de Mefchines, who had this part of Cumberland by the grant of Ranulph dc 
Mefchines.
The polTelTion of this great barony beft appears in the foregoing table 
of defcents, p.
27.
The gateway tower is ornamented with the arms of Umfrevills, Multons, 
Lucies, Percies, and Nevills.
That arrangement of arms points out the age of 
this part of the fortrefs.
Maud, or (by fome authors) Matilda, fucceeded to the 
baronial honours and eftates of her brother Anthony in the time of King Edward 
III.
whofe daughter and heir v;as dead without ilTue. The centre coat armour is 
of the Lucies, on the dexter hand ot which are Umfrevills and Multons, (he being 
the lineal defcendant of the Multons, and married Umfrevill to her firfl hufband; 
the finifler arms are thofe of Percy, the lion of Brabant, and the arms of Nevill, 
Percy being her fecond hufband, and the lafl coat was probably given in compliment 
to the family with whom Reginald her fecond brother had made a marriage alli- 
ance, or in compliment to Lord Percy, w'hofe firfl wife was a daughter of Ralph 
Lord Nevill.* Joceline, the laft Earl of Northumberland of that line, left an only 
daughter Elizabeth, who married his Grace, Charles Seymore, Duke of Somerfet, 
who, in in her right, pofTefled the honour of Cockermouth.
The fine eminence on which the caflle of Cockermouth ftands, flrongly forti- 
fied by nature, was a mofl eligible fite for a baronial fortrefs and manfion.
The 
mofl ancient part of the edifice is the ruined fquare tower to the norih-wefi ; under 
which is a fpacious vault, thirty feet fquare, which you approach by a defeent of 
twelve fteps from the inner area ; and this place is lighted by one fmall grated 
w indow, not large enough to permit the efcape of any inhabitant.
The vault is 
formed of groined and interfering arches, fupported by an ocflagonal centre pillar, 
and pilaflers at the corners and fides.
The pillar is perforated to contain a lead 
pipe, which conveyed w'ater to thofe who were fccured in the cell.
This part of 
the caflle may, with great probability, be attributed to the age in which Waldeof 
lived.
To give a perfer idea of the magnificence and flrength of this baronial 
feat, and of the tafle in fo early an era of the Normans, an infide view of the tower, 
exhibiting the remains of what was the ancient flate, would be an agreeable 
attendant to this defeription.
The vault was ufed for the chief retreat of the 
family, and place of fecurity for their valuables, whenever the fortrefs was attempted 
to be flormed by an enemy.
In the year 1648, this caflle being garrifoned for the king, was reduced by the 
parliamentary forces, burnt, or otherwife difmantled; and has lain totally in ruins

The direftors of this Charity, with a grateful fenfibllity of that patronage and fupport long reeeived 
from Its liberal fiibfcribers, earncftly hope that the preceding general ftate of its proceedings, funds, and 
events, will merit and obtain their entire approbation.
— The primaiy motive to the eftabliftiment of this 
Dispensary, In anticipating, removing, or alleviating the diftreftes of the Indigent Tick, has been perfectly 
fulfilled ; and every precautive and preventive exertion afiiduoufly and fuccefsfully made, to mitigate 
the baneful virulency, and interrupt the alarming communication of contagious difeafe.
— The utility of 
the feveral appendages will alio be very obvious, efpeclally the legular admiflion of midouifery obje£li, and 
the beneficial pradlice of inoculation ; — whilft the numerous means of reftoring animation, governed by the 
frequent inftrudlions of the ingenious Regifter of the Royal Humane Society, can be occafionally em- 
ployed.
— To the neighbouring villages thefe falutary aids have been happily extended, and fo far as 
a limited fituation, and the unavoidable redudflon of its annual fubfcriptions would permit, this Medical 
and Surgical Charity has been varioufiy and effeiftually adminiftered to the fucccur of human ixioe.

The market is held on Monday weekly, and every fortnight there are fhews of 
cattle on the Wednefdays in the great ftreet, from the beginning of May till 
Michaelmas.
There are likewife two general fairs held in the market-place, on 
Whicfun Monday and Martinmas Monday, for hiring fervants.

average 
Soil akd Produce.] In Seemurthy the foil in general is coldifh clay ; the moft fertile land lies to- 
wards Oufebridge, which produces every kind of grain in a middling degree.
Much of the land is in grafs.
Mines and Quarries.] In the eaft part of Seemurthy is a blue date quarry.
Trials are making 
for copper ore.
Manufactures.] Befides the manufaftures before mentioned, there is a paper-mill at Cockermouth.
Fuel.] Coal.
Aspect and General Appearance.] The lands in the chapelries lie in long ridges, of pretty high 
hills ; the Derwent bounds the north fide, to which the greateft part of the land dopes rapidly.
Some 
plots adjoining the river good land.
— Seemurthy is very woody, and has a pretty pleafant appearance ; 
the cultivated land lies towards the river.
The old cadlc and church of Cockermouth are the bold 
figures in the appearance of that town, and have a fine efieft on the landfcape at fomc little diftance.— —

Housman’s Notes.
One of the moft fingular perfons who hath lived in this neighbourhood the laft hundred years, was 
Salathiel Court.
This eccentric genius w'as a writing mafter, and continued to exercife this profedion, at Intervals, 
through the whole of his fingular life ; at leaft as long as he lived in England.
He was born at Papcaftle, 
where he podeded a houfe ; and, in the firft part of his life, lived admired and refpedled.
He had an 
extraordinary turn for wit and humour, wft.ich led him Into company, and thence he fell Into habits of 
intemperance.
He was fo much the mafter of his profedion, that he always had a full fchool, till he 
became too negligent to attend to it.
Before he had given himfelf up to Improper habits, he lived In 
cafe and abundance, and indulged himfelf even in extravagance of drefs.
He married Into a refpedfable 
family in Ennerdale, who podeded a very handfome eftate.
Afterwards he abandoned himfelf to the 
loweft company, and paded through ftrangc vlciditudes of life.
He was accuftomed to fpeak in rhyme 
upon moft occafions, and to mix great wit and humour in his replies.
Occafionally he performed a little 
painting ; and monuments of his humble attainments In that art are preferred In almoft all the country 
chapels m the weft of Cumberland, and fome of the figns of the public-houfes and inns there.
Once 
being employed to paint a fign, the Innkeeper chofe a lion, which Salathiel requefted to be allowed to 
reprefent chained.
The man inquiring if the chain would Increafe the expence, and being anfwered in 
the affiimatlvc, ordered Salathiel not to pain any chain.
He fet to work, and painted the lion In water 
colours.
Next time Salathiel vlfited the innkeeper, he accufed him of unfair dealing, to which Salathiel 
anfwered, — That the lion had indeed run away, but It was what might be expedled in a wild bcajl— 
without a chain.
Salathiel having at length become the companion of beggars, he had great employment In writing 
paffes for them, which he did in a moft humorous way ; and as his employers could neither read nor 
write, they chearfully exhibited the knave s jokes throughout the country.
Salathiel was continually 
getting into debt, until his credit was quite gone, and he ufed to fay, fuch wras the mode he took of 
communicating and enforcing Chrlftlan principles — -faith gave him credit, and repentance followed of 
courfe.
In the laft ftage of his degeneracy, he cohabited with a low woman, whom he employed to beg 
for his and her own fupport.
And when (he died at Whitehaven, he colledled money under pretence of 
the pious duty of burying an affedfionate wife ; which, having procured, he fpent In liquor, and then told 
the overfeer of the poor, that he would leave the remains to him as a legacy, and if he did not chufe to 
bury her, he might difpofe of her as he thought belt.
When flie was brought out to be conveyed to the 
church-yard, Salathiel fo far facrificed his humanity and good fenfe to his humour, that (alluding to the 
poor woman’s having been accuftomed to fing ballads) called on the clerk, to let her have a merry tune, 
for ihe liked finging all her life.

As was obferved before, this is a chapel ry in the parifh of Brigham, and appears 
to have been appropriate to the collegiate church of Staindrop, in the county of 
Durham, together with the mother church.* The church, dedicated to All-Saints, 
was rebuilt in 1711, and rendered very commodious for the large congregation 
which reforts to it : it is one hundred feet in length, and forty-five broad, and lined 
with galleries.

A chauntry in this chapel, was founded and endowed 
Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland.
There was a fpacious park for deer appertaining to the baronial manfion here, 
extending from the tow'n eaftward about a mile; but being difparked, the lands 
have been brought into cultivation.
A fchool was founded in the town of Cockermouth by Philip Lord Wharton, 
Amongft other unlawful pradlices in which Salathiel indulged hitnfelf, he frequently took upon him to- 
marry thole who either could not be admitted to marriage in a regular way, or who only ufed the cere- 
mony as a mere pretence, to cover an illicit connedlion.
This, however, at laft led poor Court into a 
fcrape.
He had married two perfons who were within the degrees of affinity prohibited by the laws..
They had given it out that they were married, and were taken before a magiftrate, and called upon to.
produce a certificate, which the man being permitted to do, went immediately to procure one.
Salathiel 
granted his requeft, and gave him the following certificate, alluding to their having a child previoufly to.
their marriage : — 
“ Under yon hedge, in frolly weather, 
“ I joined this w**** and r**** together ; 
“ Let none but Jove, who rules the thunder, 
“ Then puc this w**** and r**** afunder.
S. C.” 
Tills certificate being produced, was afterwards made the ground of a profecution againft Salathiel at 
Carlille, and the poor fellow was.
In confcquence, tranfported to America.
When he arrived in America, 
he met with friends who.
gave him money to pay his paffage, and Salathiel once more enjoyed his free- 
dom In a land of liberty.
His wit furniffied him with fcbemes by which he there contrived to enjoy his 
pitcher and j'eft.
He lived but a few years.
Such was the life of a man, whofe fayings have furniffied more witty phrafes and droll maxims for the 
country people, than thofe of any man who ever lived In thofe parts.
It is a life not ^without infruiiion 
— too much vivacity has led many a man of talents to Improper company, and to the forming of wrong 
habits ; and many, through their wiffi to gain admiration amongft the vulgar, have negleftcd that which 
alone can give weight and importance to iuperlbrity of mental accompliffiments — a virtuous conduit.
Bad 
company lays the foundation of every thing that can deprave the heart, or difgrace the man.
We are obliged to an unknown correfpondent for this communication ; the diftlon of which we did' 
Bot prefume to alter, as it bears ftrong traits of the charaAer on which he fo juftly moralizes.

The fituation of this town is beautiful, in a country well cultivated, on the banks 
of two fine rivers, and in a climate tempered by the mountains which flielter the 
place from the north-eaff, and by a happy diftance from the weftern ocean.
— 
Beneath the cartle, on the margin of the river Derwent, is a plain of confiderable 
extent, in which is a public walk, almoft a mile in length : the fiream falls over 
a rough channel ; the oppofite banks are in tillage ; whilfi; the plain is laid out in 
meadows, bounded by a gentle afeent covered with wood.
This walk is beautifully 
terminated at each end ; one by lofty cliffs fcattered over with trees, the other by 
the ruins of the cattle impending over the river, which is crolfed by a bridge of 
two arches, forming a communication with the village of Derwent, feen hanging 
on the diflant declivity.
An indulgent correspondent has furniflied the Editor w ith the following re- 
marks : — The chapelry is five miles in length from eaft to weft, and two miles in 
breadth from north to fouth, at the northern extremity of the diocefe of Chefter, 
which is here bounded by the Derw’ent.
That river feparates Cockermouth 
chapelry from Ifel and Bridekirk on the north, the lake of Baftenthwaite divides 
it from the parifii of that name on the eaft, the parifhes of Embleton and Lorton 
adjoin to it on the fouth, and on the weft Brigham.
In the year 1785, an accurate calculation was made of the people of the town 
of Cockermouth, when we found that there were 663 families, and 2652 inhabi- 
tants.
It is remarkable, that the average number of perfons to a family was no 
more than four.
Since that time there has been no material change in the popu- 
lation of this place.

The church is built of freeftone, the ancient tower remaining ; a fet of fix bells,

The altar-piece is ornamented with paintings- 
of Mofes and Aaron.
There is a parochial library kept in a room over the free-

Cockermouth.
He was fucceeded by Thomas Jelferfon, A.
M. of Queen’s 
College, Oxford, who died in P'ebruary, 1768, and was buried at Cockermouth.
Since that time no one has been nominated to this church.
It is remarkable, that 
there have been only two incumbents fince the year 1640.

There is one dilTenting and one Quaker meeting-houfe here; the families of 
diflenters about 120 in number — the Quaker families about 30.
The free grammar fchool was founded foon after the reformation, and now 
contains about 30 fcholars.
— A charity fchool, inllituted in 1784, aind fupported 
by a voluntary fubfcription of 21I.
per annum, now contains 63 fcholars; a Sunday 
fchool inllituted in 1785, and fupported by the offerings at the monthly commu- 
nions, receives near 100 fcholars; belides thefe there are feveral private fchools, 
which receive upon an average about 25 fcholars each.
Here is an hofpital founded about twenty-five years ago, by the Rev. Thomas 
Leathes, Redlor of Plumbland, for fix poor widows.
The annual value of lands and houfes fomewhat exceeds 4000I, a year : the poor 
rates annually amount to about is.
6d.
in the pound ; in the workhoufe there are 
about forty paupers ; but feveral out-penfioners are added to that number.
— There 
are four friendly focieties, confifting of nearly five hundred members, Thefe 
focieties hold out an example to the reft of the kingdom ; for, befides the com- 
fortable relief they afford to their fick and reduced brethren, in Cockermouth they 
have relieved the poor rate fo much, that, about ten years ago, the annual colledlion 
amounted to 4s: in the pound.
The fituation of Cockermouth is low and w'arm, fometimes fogs in the evenings, 
yet very healthy, as appears by the regifter, as not above one perfon in forty dies 
annually.
It is well watered, for, befides the two greater rivers, there are alfo tw'o 
rivulets, which afford great accommodation to the manufadurers.
The rivers 
abound with falmon, trout, brandling, pike, eels, and other fmallcr fifti.
There are four bridges, which are fupported by the public.

By the return made to parliament, it appears that nearly the fum of 800I.
given by different bcnefa( 5 tors, belongs to this parifh, the inrereft of which is 
diftributed, partly in bread every Sunday, and partly in money, at the difcretion of 
the churchwardens, to the relief of poor houfe keepers.
The hills on the oppofite fide of the Derwent are efteemed a curiofity by the 
naturalifi, being compofed entirely of a calcarious fione, almofl wholly compofed 
of Ihells of the anomia genus.* 
Almofi: adjoining to the north fide of the town, is a tumulus, or artificial mount, 
called Tool-Hiil, which does not appear to have been examined; it perfedlly 
refembles the larger barrows found in many parts of England ; and we obferve that, 
the fame name of ^Tool or 'Tent is given to a tumulus lately opened near Uttoxeter, 
in Stafford fhire, and to another in Dorfetfhire, in both of which the remains of 
human bodies were found.
The rampart and ditch of a fort, or encampment, at 
a p'ace called Pitts-Wood, lies one mile wefi of Cockermouth, and dire< 5 lly oppofite 
to the Homan ftation at Papcafile ; it is of triangular form, and about 750 feet in 
circuit : the people of the country have no tradition concerning it.
f 
To the eafi and north-eaft of Cockermouth lie three other difiricls, parcels of 
the parilh of Brigham.
H UGHTHWAiTE, a fmall manor, which was the ancient inheritance of a family 
of that name, and came to the Swinburns by intermarriage wdth the hcirefs.
It 
was held by the fervice of homage and witnefTman in Derwent fells ; and two 
inclofurcs, called Diinthwaiie and Brunthwailey by the fervice of rendering a pair 
of gilt fpurs at Eafier yearly, and doing homage.
Secmurthow', or Seatmurthow, a village in which there is a fmall chapel, 
whofe revenue was certified to the governors of Queen’s Anne’s bounty at 40s, 
yearly, which the inhabitants, by voluntary contribution paid to a reader.
This chapel has been augmented three times, and the income is now about 24I.
a 
year, the prefent incumbent the Rev. W.
Sewell.
Before its augmentation, the 
reader of divine fervice had a precarious income, fometimes not exceeding twenty 
fiiillings a year in money payment; but an acdual cufiom fubfifted for feveral years, 
of allowing the poor minifier a whiltle-gate.
He was privileged to go from houfe 
to houfe in the chapelry, and to ftay a certain number of days at each place, where 
he was permitted to enter his whitlley or knife, with the reft of the people of the 
houfehold, and to (hare the provifions prepared for the ufe of the family.
This 
cuftom has been abolifhed in fuch modern times, that it is in the memory of many 
perfons now living.
The holy man’s converlation and offices amply repaid the 
benevolence of the family; by example and precept, he inculcated into the younger 
minds principles of religion and morality; and, by impartial counfel and advice, 
prevented many errors in the elders.

Embleton, a village pleafantly fituated.
“ Embleton above Derwent, villa 
“ Amabiliie, lies next unto Wythorpe and Seatmurthow, on the north-weft fide of 
Wythorpe.
In the time of King Richard I.
it was part of the demelne of 
Allerdale above Derwent.
And then Robert Curtney, and dame Alice Romley 
his wife, one of the three daughters and coheirs of William Fitz Duncan, (Lord

The lake of BalTenthwaite looks from thence like a gloomy abyfs, 
and the vale above Kefwick, with the lake of Derwentwater, appeared to us as 
enchanted ground ; where the feene feemed realized, which was imagined by the 
ingenious author of the tale of the Prince of Abyflinia, in which the young hero of 
his narrative was held, fecluded from the bufy world, by encircling mountains.— 
Skiddaw, fhrouded w'ith vapours, appeared to nod his drowfy head ; and innu- 
merable eminences, one behind another, pufhed their fronts to the viev/, and 
crowded the horizon with enormous objefls.
From this pafs, v;here the road 
becomes more level, you are inclofed by mountains on each hand, at whofe feet 
the path lies, and whole fummits are not to be reached by the traveller’s eye who 
palTes fo immediately under them, as they rife almoft perpendicularly.
A fine 
verdure covers moll of them, and they afford excellent iheep-walks ; others arc 
barren, bleak, and fliivery, fending down continued ffreams of fand.

ftones, with every fliower of rain.
The contraft makes thefe vaff objects agreeable

Suddenly you emerge from this gigantic feene into 
THE VALE OF LORTON.
through which the river Cocker runs, — a theatre formed of ftupendous heights, 
about three miles in diameter, beautified with rich meadows, eminences covered 
with w'ood, and fcattered hamlets : whilff here and there perpendicular and lofty 
cliffs burH; from the lides of the furrounding mountains.
Mr. Gilpin, fpeaking of this vale, fays — “ This vale, unlike all the paff, prefents 
“ us with a landfcape intirely new.
No lakes, no rocks are here to blend the ideas 
of dignity and grandeur with that of beauty.
All is fimplicity and repofe.
— 
Nature, in this feene, lays totally alide her raajeffic frown, and wears only a 
lovely fmile.
The vale of Lorton is of the extended kind, running a confiderable way be- 
tween mountains, which range at about a mile’s diftance.
They are near enough 
" to fereen it from the fform ; and yet not fo impending as to exclude the fun.— 
Their fides, though not fmooth, are not much diverfified.
A few knolls and 
hollows juft givea little variety to the broad lights and fhades, which overfpread 
them.
This vale, which enjoys a rich foil, is, in general, a rural, cultivated feene; 
“ though in many parts the ground is beautifully broken and abrupt.
A bright 
“ ftream, w hich might almoft take the name of a river, pours along a rocky chan- 
nel, and fparkles dowm numberlefs little cafeades.
Its banks are adorned with 
wood ; and varied with different objects ; a bridge, a mill, a hamlet ; a glade 
“overhung with wood; or fome little fweet recefs; or natural vifta, through 
“ which the eye ranges, between irregular trees, along the windings of the 
ftream.
“ Except the mountains, nothing in all this feenery is great; but every part is

** We had to regret, that we faw the vale of Lorton only in half its beauty.
It-

The morning had

efFedls they produced in a ftorm.
A mountain is an object of grandeur ; and 
its dignity receives new force by mixing with the clouds ; and arraying itfelf

Lorton, including the Chapehies of Buttermere and Wythorp, 
The tillable and inclofed lands here bear a fmall proportion to the mountainous part, the valley of But- 
termere in particular is low, narrow, and crooked; the vale of Lorton is of confiderable breadth, level 
and beautiful ; in Wythorp it is neither extenfive nor level.
Soil and Produce.] In Buttermere the foil is gravelly.
It is alfo dry and gravelly In Brackenth- 
waite.
About Lorton the foil is chiefly a light loam, deep and very fertile, producing all forts of grain, 
turnips and potatoes.
In Wythorp the foil is chiefly clay, and rarher wet.
The crops oats.
Sheep and Cattle.] In the places now under our notice, about 1 0,500 flieep are kept, of a heavier 
breed than feme in the neighbourhood, particularly thofe at Lowfwater.
Horfes are alfo in general of 
good ftature; and black cattle weigh upon an average ten ftone and a half per quarter.
Lakes.] In Buttermere lake are pike, trout, bafs, eels and char.
The lake about half a mile in breadth- 
Rivers.] The river Cocker bounds the weft fide of Buttermere and Lorton ; It contains trout, and 
falmon in the fpawning feafon.
This river rifes near the black-lead mines In Borrowdale, whence it 
fuppHes Buttermere lake, and from thence it flows through Crummock lake.
The eaftern part of 
Wythorp touches Baffenthwaite water.
In thefe parts are feveral fmall brooks and fpnngs.
Roads.] No very public ones, except that which leads from Kefwick to Cockermouth by Whinlater, 
and that which pafles through Wythorp.
Quarries.] No freeftone, limeftone, or coal.
— Excellent flate quarries in Buttermere.
Rents.] On an average at Lorton 16s.

General Appearance.] Proceeding from Buttermere, where the mountains are very high, fteep, 
and rocky on every fide, we pafs through Brackenthwaite, there we find a mountain on the right, and 
the river Cocker on the left ; and other mountains in fucceflion.
The ground is dry and gravelly, the 
road good, the lands Hope towards the river.
On the flclrts of the mountains grow fern and brufhwood j

In thefe waters char are taken, and mofl; excellent trout.
The river Cocker rifes among the hills, and feeds thefe lakes.
This is parcel of the manor of Derwent fells, holden of the honour of Cocker- 
mouth, and was granted by the crown to Lord Grey, with Brackenthwaite, and 
paired therewith in the feveral fubfequent fales.f 
As the lake of Buttermere is one of the fcenes which are fo much admired, and 
has been defcrifaed by public writers, we will prefent the reader with extradls from 
fuch works as have chiefly poflelTed the public attention, 
Mr. Weft recommended the ride to Buttermere to be made by the vale of 
Newlands.
He fays, thofe " who vilit the vale of Kefwick, and view the lake 
from Caftlerigg, Latrigg, Swinfide, and the vicarage, imagine inaccelTible 
** mountains only remain beyond the line of that amazing traft.
But whoever 
takes a ride up Newlands vale, will be agreeably furprized with fome of the fineft: 
folemn paftoral fcenes they have yet beheld.” 
We cannot proceed without noticing the ancient workings of a copper mine in 
the vale of Newlands, at a place called Goldjcope; an old fhaft is faid to extend from 
the top of the hill to its bafe, where it reaches a level, cut through from fide to fide 
of the mount, and a ftream of water from Bankbeck was conveyed to turn a drawing 
machine.
There is a tradition here, that the mine was wrought in the reign of King 
Henry VIII.
and for fome time afterwards ; but the ore producing gold, the mine 
was conftdered as a royal mine, and a difpute was agitated betw'een the crown and 
the Duke of Somerfet, lord of the manor, which occafioned the works to be dif- 
continued.
In the year 1757, fome adventurers expended about tool, and drained 
the works, but did not find the metal of that quality or of a quantity fufficient to 
encourage them to proceed.
Thefe copper mines were difeovered, as it is faid, by two Germans from 
Augfburg, and a fuit was depending between Queen Elizabeth and Thomas, then 
Earl of Northumberland, in whofe lordftiip of Derwent fells the mines were 
fituated.
There being more gold and filver in value than copper or lead in the 
mines, they were adjudged to be the right of the crowm, on an argument on the 
defendant’s demurrer : and it was then pronounced as law", that where the gold and 
filver extradled from the copper or lead was of greater value than the copper or 
lead, the mine w'as a royal mine, and the property of the crow n.
By the ftatute of ift William and Mary, ch.
30, it w’as enaded, “ That no mine 
of tin, copper, iron, or lead, fliould thereafter be adjudged, reputed, or taken to 
“ be a royal mine, although gold or filver may be extraded out of the fame,” 
provided that all gold or filver that fhould be extraded bedifpofed of at the mint 
within the Towner of London.
That law not proving eftedual in fome cafes to 
quiet the fubjed, another ftatute was made in the 5th y.ear of William and Mary, 
ch.
6, intituled “ An ad to prevent difputes and controverfies concerning royal 
** mines,” whereby it is enaded, that the proprietors of mines ftiall hold and en- 
joy them, “ Provided that their majefties, their heirs and fucceflfors, and all 
claiming any royal mines under them, Ihall or may have the ore of any fuch

The mine in Newlands was faid to ferve not only all England, but an extenfivc 
foreign market, until the fmelting-houfes and works were deftroyed, and moft of 
the miners flain in the civil wars.
Since that event, the works have never been 
revived to any account.
To return to Mr. Weft — He guides you dowm Swinfide, and points out a 
pleaiing view, though down a narrow vale, from the gate on the right, after the 
traveller has pafled the firft houfes.
— “The road continues winding through a 
“ glade, along the fide of a rapid brook : at the hedge-row tree under Rawling- 
“ end, you have a new and pleafant view of the Kefwick vale.
About Kefcadale, 
“ the laft houfes in Newlands, no traces of human induftry appear, — all is naked 
*\foilitude and Jimple nature.
The vale now becomes a dull road or path.
The 
“ lower parts are pajiured with a motley herd, the middle tra(ft; is ajfumed by the 
“ flocks, the upper regions, to man inacceflible, are abandoned to the birds of 
“ Jove.” — We forbear to follow Mr. Weft’s high painting : fpeaking of the 
approach to Newlands hawfe, — “ A mountain prefents itfelf in front ; and, among 
“ the variety of waterfalls that diftinguifhes this awful boundary, one catches the 
“ eye at a diftance, that exceeds Lodore in height of rock and unity of fall.”— 
He then deferibes four mountains of a fpiral form, “ the more fouthern called by 
“ the dalefmen Hayrick, another Highcrag, a third Highjiile, and the fourth, from 
“ its colour, Redpike.
Between the fecond and third there is a large crater, which 
“ appears to have been the focus of a volcano in fome diftant period of time.
At 
" prefent it is the refervoir of water that feeds the cataradl near Buttermere.
— Here 
“ all is barrennefs, folitude, and fllence, interrupted only by the murmurs of a rill 
“ that runs unfeen in the bottom of a deep dell.
The fmooth verdant fides of the 
“ vaft hills on the right have many furrows engraven in their fides by the winter 
“ rains ; and the fable mountains in front prefent all the horrors of cloven rock, 
“ broken cliff, and mountain ftreams tumbling headlong.
“ You now approach the village of Buttermere, which is fituated between the 
“ lakes, and confifts of fixteen houfes.
The chapel here is very fmall, the ftipend 
“ 7 iot large ; for, though twice augmented with the queen’s bounty, it exceeds not 
“ twenty pounds per annum.” 
Mr. Wert had an unhappy talent of fpeaking in the language of cenfure or

A few hands are employed in

fafe.
No villainous banditti haunt the mountains ; innocent people live in the

Every cottager is narrative of all he knows ; and mountain virtue and

This conffitutes a pleafing difference 
betwixt travelling here and on the continent, where every innholder is an extor- 
** tioner, and every voiturin an impofing rogue.” 
The next traveller who deferibes thCfe fcenes is Mr. Gilpin, from whofe v/ork 
we will make fome extracts.
“ Erom Kefwick we mounted the hills on the north-wefi: of the lake; and, on 
** the other fide, fell into the valley of Newlands, which we traverfed from end to 
** end.
It was a lovely feene, totally different from the rude valleys we had yet 
met with.
The mountains in general on this fide of the lake wear a fmoother 
form than thofe either on the eafl or on the fouth.
Of this fmoothaefs of 
feature in the higher grounds, the lower participate.
The mountain valleys 
** we had hitherto feen, were rocky, wild, and defdlate ; but here the idea of terror 
was excluded.
The valley of New lands was even adorned with the beauties of 
luxuriant nature.
We travelled through groves v.'hich were fometimes open 
“ and fometimes ciofe, with a -fparkling ftrearn, the common attendant of thefe 
** valleys, accompanying us through the whole feene.
Having been amufed with this delightful feenery through the fpaceof three 
miles, w'e entered another valley, or rather a mountain rccefs, called the valley 
of Gafcadale.
I call it a recefs, becaufe it is foon terminated by a nntountain 
“ running athwart, which denies any further paffage.

entering Gafcadale,!
we were obliged to climb the hill which forms one of its 
” lides : and from the fummit we had a view not only of Gafcadale, but of mayn 
other mountain recefles, all which participate more or lefs of the fmoothnefs 
of the high grounds in their neighbourhood.
Some of them were fcooped and 
hollowed into beautiful forms; in which wood only was wanting.
The valley of Gafcadale had nothing to recommend it but novelty ; a dead 
mountain recefs, environed on every fide, except the entrance, by fmooth Hoping 
hills which are adorned neither with wood, nor rock, nor broken ground, but 
fweep down from fide to fide, with the greateft regularity.
At the head of this 
recefs is a grand cafeade.” — We have no defeription of this waterfall, the fogs 
interfedled the traveller’s view.
The mountain over Avhich we pafTed is called the Hazvfe^ or floppage, the 
** valley being clofed, and no other w'ay left.
This Hawfe, though not fb flscp as 
** the mountain w'hich led us to Watenlath, was of much longer continuance, and 
in fomc parts carried us very near the edges of the precipices.
“ As we began to defeend, we breathed a purer air, and got a fight of the 
landfcapc before us.
It was a feene unlike what we had juft paffedi — Three 
“ broad mountains, floping into each other, formed a tripartite valley, centring 
in one point.
The furface of each mountain was fmooth to its fummit; through 
tw'o of the divifions of the valley ran different ftreams, each of them as unfringed 
" and fimple as the mountains they fevered.
Thefe ftreams, uniting in the centre, 
formed a third.
Thefe fmooth coated mountains are great fources of plenty ; 
they are the nurferies of flieep, which are bred here and fatted in the valleys.

“ their lives, he muft often expofe his own.
“ After winding about two miles along the edge of one of thefe fmooth meun-

THE VALE OF BUTTERMERE, 
the bottom of which was adorned by a lake of the fame name.

” at a diftance like a white ribband biflecfling the mountain.
The people of the 
country, alluding to the whitencfs of its foam, call it Sour -milk-force.
“ The vale of Buttermere is rather confined in that part which the lake occupies.
“ Below it extends a confiderable way.
Gajgarthdale opens at the head of the 
lake.
Here we found two valleys formed by a mountain on each fide and one 
*• in the middle.
The right hand valley was clofed by bavefe : the left led to 
the feenes we fought after.
The tranfition here is abrupt.
We had been 
travelling all the morning among mountains perfectly fmooth, covered with 
“ herbage; and now found ourfelves fuddenly among crags and rocks and preci- 
pices, as wild and hideous as any we had feen.
“ Gatesgarthdale, into which we foon entered, is indeed a very tremendous 
feene.
It had a peculiar charader.
Its features were its own.
It was not a 
“ vifta like the valley of Watenlath, nor had it any of the fudden turns of the 
valley of Borrowdale, but it wound flowly and folemnly in one large fegmenr.
“ It was wider alfo than either of thofe valleys ; being at leaf!
half a quarter of a 
“ mile from fide to fide.
The area of this valley is in general concave ; the fidcs 
almoft perpendicular, compofed of a kind of broken craggy rock, the ruins of 
which every where firew the valley; and give it flill more the image of defolatioii.
The river alfo which runs through it, and is the principal fupply of the lake, is 
as wild as the valley itfelf.
As we proceeded, the grandeur of the valley increafed.
But we found ths 
mountains fo overhung with clouds, that we could form little judgment of their 
height.
Our guide told us they were twice as high as we could fee.
The middle 
“ of the valley is adorned, as thefe valleys in fome part often are, by a craggy hill r 
“ on the top of which {lands the fragment of a rock, that looks, in Ojjian'% language, 
** like the ftone of Power y the rude deity of defolation, to w hich the feene is facred.
“ The vale of Buttermere, which extends many miles below the lake, is a wide 
variegated feene, full of rifing and falling grounds, woody in many parts ; well 
inhabited in fome ; fruitful and luxuriant in all.
In the chearful and healthy 
" looks of the inhabitants, we met new proofs of the narrow limits in which all 
“ the real wants of life are comprized.”

The under lake, called

is diftant from the other, near a mile; the intermediate ground' cultivated.
It 
is three miles in length, and about one mile in breadth.

fun fhining upon them has a fine effedt.
The terminating objedls are fingularly 
beautiful ; an eminence, fcattered over with a few trees, and thrown into inclofures 
in irregular figures, is in the front; over which ftand feveral tenements, with the 
chapel of Lowfwater: the back-ground confining of the eminences of Lowfell, 
oppofing a warm brown colouring to the verdant margin of the lake, clofes the 
Jandfeape beautifully.
There is a fine waterfall here, worthy the traveller’s attention.
Thefe feenes are extremely pidlurefque; and, in their narrower fcale, afford the 
painter finer leffons than the larger lakes, as they comprehend greater variety of 
objects, drawn within the compafs of the eye without fiiifting; — a circumfiance 
neceffary to the painter.
This lake has been lately much vifited by tourifts.
We have attempted to fay fo much of this lake, as Mr. Weft and Mr. Gilpin 
have not given fo perfed a defeription of thefe feenes, as of others which they 
had vifited.
Mr. Weft’s account of Crummock-Water is to the following purport:—* 
Crummock-Water foon opens after you leave the village, and pafs through an 
“ oaken grove.
A fine expanfe of water fweeps away to the right under a rocky 
promontory, Randon-knot, or Buttermerc-hawfe.
The road ferpentizes round 
the rock, and under a rugged pyramidal craggy mountain.
From the creft of 
this rock, the whole extent of lake is difeovered.
On the w'eftern fide, the 
mountains rife immediately from the v/ater’s edge, bold and abrupt.
Juft in 
“ front, between Bleacragand Mellbreack, are two fpiral hills; the hoarfe refound- 
“ ing noife of a water-fall is heard acrofs the lake, concealed w'ithin the bofom of 
“ the cliff, through which it has forced its way, and when viewed from the foot of 
“ the fall, is a moft aftonifhing phaenomenon.
The lake is beautified with three fmall ifles ; one of rock lies juft before you.
The whole eaftern ftiorc is diverfified with bays, the banks with fcattered trees, 
and a few’ inclofures, terminated by a hanging wood.
At the foot of the lake a 
high crowned hill puflies forward, fringed with trees, and fw’eetly laid out with 
” inclofures ; and above it, on a cultivated Hope, is the chapel of Low’es-Water, 
furrounded with fcattered farms ; behind all, Low’fell fwells his verdant front, 
** a fweet contraft to his murky neighbours, and a pleafing termination, feen from 
“ the top of this rock, or from the bofom of the lake.
" The chain of pyramidal mountains, on each fide of this narrow vale, arc 
extremely pi(fturefque ; they rife from diftindl bafes, and fw'ell into the moft 
grotefque forms, and burft into rocky heads, ferrated here, and broken there.
“ Thel'e lakes are of a much greater depth than Derwent, and may be the only 
reafon why they hold char, and the other does not.
The char in the fummer 
“ months retire to the deeps, probably to avoid the heat.
The water here is clear, 
but not fo tranfparent as the Derwent.
The outlet is at the north- eaft corner, by 
“ the river Cocker, over which is a handfome ftone bridge of four arches.” 
Mr. Gilpin proceeds thus — “ Following the courfe of the river, as far as the 
inequalities of the ground w’ould admit, we foon came to another lake, ftill more 
beautiful than that we had left above.
The tw'o lakes bear a great refemblance 
R 2 "to

CRUMMOCK.
“ to each other.
Both are oblong : both wind round promontories, and both are 
“ furrounded by mountains.
But the lower lake is near a mile longer than the 
** upper one ; the lines it forms are much caller ; and though it has lefs wood on 
its banks, the lofs is compenfated by a richer difplay of rocky fcenery.
The 
“ forms of thefe rocks are in general beautiful, moft of them being broken into 
“ grand fquare furfaces.
“ With this rocky fccnery much hilly ground is intermixed- Patches of meadow 
alfo, here and there, on the banks of the lake, improve the variety.
Nothing is 
” wanting but a little more wood, to make this lake, and the vale in w'hich it lies, 
a very enchanting feene, or rather a fuccelTion of enchanting feenes ,; for.
the hills 
“ and riling grounds, into which it every where fvvells, ailing in due fubordination 
“ to the grand mountains, which environ the whole vale, break and feparate the 
" area of it into fmaller parts.
Many of thefe form little valleys and other re- 
“ celfes, which are very pidiurefque.
“ Not far from this lake, the mountain of Grafmer appears riling above all the 
“ mountains in its neighbourhood.
A lake of this name we had already feen in 
“ our road between Amblelide and Kefwick ; but there is no connexion between 
“ the lake and the mountain.
This mountain forms rather a vaft ridge than a 
“ pointed fummit; and is conneAed with two or three other mountains of in- 
ferior dignity: itfelf is laid to be equal to Skiddaw.
Grafmer, and the 
mountains in its neighbourhood, form the ealiern boundary of the vale, which 
we now traverfed; a vale at lead: live miles in length, and one-third of that 
“ fpace in breadth.
Our road carried us near the village of Brackenthwaitc, 
which lies at the bottom of Grafmer.”* 
. LOWS- 
* “ Here we had an account of an inundation, occafioned by the burfting of a waterfpout.
In that 
part where Grafmer is connefted with other high lands in its neighbourhood, three little ftreams take 
their origin ; of which the hijfa is the leafl inconfiderable.
The courfe of this ftreana down the moun- 
tain Is very deep, and about a mile in length.
Its bed, and the fides of the mountain all around, are 
pTofufely fcattered with loofe ftones and gravel.
On leaving the mountain, the Lifla divides the vale 
through which we now paffed ; and, after a courfe of four or five miles, falls into the Cocker.
“ On the 9th of September, 1760, about midnight, the waterfpout fell upon Grafmer, nearly, as was 
conjtftureJ, where the three little fircair^, juft mentioned, iffue from their fountains.
At firft it fwept 
the whole fide of the mountain, and charging Itfcif with ajl the rubbage it found there, made Its way 
into the vale, following chiefly the dIreAion of the Lifla.
At the foot of the mountain it was received 
by a piece of arable ground, on which its violence firft broke.
Here it tore away trees, foil, and gravel, 
and laid all bare many feet in depth to the naked rock.
Over the next ten acres it feems to have made 
an immenfe roll ; covering them with fo vaft a bed of ftones, that no human art can ever again reftore 
the foil.
“ "WTren we faw the place, though twelve years after the event, many marks remained, ftill flagrant, 
of this feene of ruin.
We faw the natural bed of the Lifla, a mere contracted rivulet, and on its banks 
the vefliges of a ftony channel, fprtading far and wide, almoft enough to contain the waters of the Rhine 
or the Danube.
It was computed, from the flood marks, that in many parts the ftream mutt have been 
five or fix yards deep, and near an hundred broad ; and if its great velocity be added to its weight of 
water, its force will be found equal to almoft any cffe6t.
“ On the banks of this ft.ony channel, we faw a few fcattered houfes, a part of the village of 
Brackenthwaitc, which had a wonderful efcape.
They flood at the bottom of Grafmer, rather on a 
iifing ground ; and the current taking its firft direi^lion towards them, would have undermined them in

next attra(5led our attention, — “ Lowfwater, locus In valle vel prof undo, is the name

The 
a few moments, for the foil was inftantly laid bare, had not a projeAion of native rock, the Interior 
ilratum, on which the houfes had unknowingly been founded, relifted the current, and given it a new 
direction.
Unlefs this had intervened, it is probable the houfes and all their inhabitants, fo inftantaiieoua 
was the ruin, had been fwept away together.
“ In pafling further along the vale, we faw other marks of the fury of this inundation ; bridges had 
been thrown down, houfes carried off, and woods rooted up.
But its effedts on a ftone caufeway were 
thought the moft furprifing.
This fabric was of great thicknefs, and fupported on each fide by an 
enormous bank of earth.
The memory of man could trace it, unaltered in any particular, near one

Extent.] About feven miles from north to fouth ; and from eaft to weft three miles and a half.
This chapelry contains many high and rocky mountains, yet has fertile vales, with feveral woodlands 
and rivers.
Soil and Produce.] The mountains are in general rocky and diy, the inclofed land Is light and gra- 
velly, and Is fertile In the produft ion of oats and potatoes ; a little barley and fome wheat Is grown, but few 
turnips, although the foil feems proper for the latter ; for, notwithftanding the wild and mountainous 
fituation, the tillage land lying low and warm, ftieltered on every fide by high hills which refleft the fun’s 
rays, the climate is rendered very temperate.
A great part of the inclofures are in grafs ; and much 
butter and cheefe are made.
Rents.] The average per acre Is about 14s.
Sheep and Cattle.] About 5700 flieep are kept In this chapehy, fix of the fleeces will weigh a 
Rone, which fells for 7s.

— Horfes are fourteen hands and a half high.
— Black cattle bred here weigh 
about ten ftone a quarter.
Lakes.] Lowfwater and Crummock ; the former about a mile In length, and a quarter of a mile in 
breadth; and has pike, trout, bafs, and eels.
— The .latter lies about a mile to the fouth, and is nearly two 
miles in length, and half a mile In breadth ; and has pike, trout, bafs, eels, and char.
Game, &c.] Groufe, hares, and partridge ; many wdld ducks In the lakes in winter.
— On the fell* 
marts, foxes, and wild cats.
About fix years ago there were red deer on the hills, which probably had 
bred there for ages.
Rivers, &c.] The river Cocker divides this parifli from Lorton.
— There are feveral fmall ftreams of 
very pure water.
At a place called Scaleforce or Highforce, a brook defeends from a rocky mountain In 
one fall near 180 feet perpendicular.
It is truly pi£lurefque.
— The lands of part of the chapelry 
are held under the Earl of Egremont as lord of the manor, and other part under Sir Wilfrid Lawfon.
Schools.] One near the church unendowed.
— At Mockerton, Mary Moorhoufe, widow, a lady of 
an ancient and refpedlable family, built aad endowed a fchool in the year 1782, for ten poor children.
The ftipend arifes from the Intereft of 200I.
Inverted in truft for that purpofe.
Road.] From Egremont to Kefwick, very dry and good.
Estates.] In this chapelry generally fmall, from 20I.
to 40I.
a year; two or three about tool, a 
year.
They are occupied by the owners.
General Appearance.] The mountains are very high and rocky, feveral of them in fome points of 
view appear conical, and rife from their bafe fo rapidly, that on fome Tides they cannot be afeended.
On 
the fides and fkirts of thele fells grow feveral trees and much brurtrwood, which afford great ornament to 
the landfcape.
The arable land is pretty level, and runs clofe up to the feet of the mountains.
The fences 
are chiefly of quiekwood and earth mounds, wherein many trees grow, of different kinds.
The Inclofures 
are pretty regular, and buildings are uncommonly good.
Upon the whole, much of this trail affor ds as 
b.eautiful and romantic retirements as any part of Cumberland, pr the north of England.

Housman’s Notes.
At Crabtreebeck, in this chapelry, was born, In the year 1631, John Burnyeat, a perfon well qualified 
for diffeminatlng the principles and pradtices of the people called ^takers, and who had been excelled by 
few in the pains he took In travelling in the fervice of the gofpel ; he vifited Great-Britain and Ireland 
feveral times, was twice upon the American continent, and on feveral of the Weft India iflands ; was a 
perfon of great religious experience ; and though he had no peculiar literary advantage above others, his 
gofpel labours commanded reverence, being in dodtrine clear, elegant, and pathetic, yet far from thinking 
highly of himfelf, to exalt the minifter, knowing that to him belonged blufhing and confufion of face ; 
but he magnified his office, and the power of him who had feen meet to employ him therein.
About the 
year 1683, he married and fettled in Dublin ; and in the year 1690, as he was again vifiting that nation, 
he was taken ill at New Garden, where he died, and left behind him a journal of his gofpel labours in a 
large quarto volume, which was printed at London the year following.
Q. 
yames Dickinfon was born at Low Moorhoufe, in the pai ifti of Dean, in this neighbourhood, in the 
year 1659 ; and, in the eighteenth year of his age, he was called to the work of the miniftry amongft the 
people called ; it .was fuppofed, more people were convinced through his miniftry, than by any 
other perfon whatever, excepting George Fox’s.
He was an able minifter of the gofpel, an zealous 
promoter of the caufe of righteoufnefs, and laboured faithfully therein.
He vifited Ireland twelve times, 
America thrice, Holland and Germany once, and la’ooured much in his native county and nation of Great- 
Britain.
He handled not the word of God deceitfully, but was a workman that needed not to be afliamed ; ; 
he was willing to fpend and be fpent difintereftedly, fo as he but gathered fouls to God : he preached not 
for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, for the love of Chrift conftrained him, which is the proper founda- 
tion of all gofpel miniftry'.
In his laft illnefs, he often faid, “ Though he was weak he was well, and , 
had nothing but peace on every hand,” expreffing his care and concern for the growth and prefervation of' 
the church.
He died in the y'ear 1741, w'as buried at Eaglefield, near Cockermouth, aged elghty-tw'o, , 
a minifter fixty-four years ; and, fome years after his death, was publiftied in London, a book, entitled!’'

Stye-head, Honifler-crag, Wafdale, the Pillar, and Redpike, are the great land-, 
marks of this tra( 5 t.
Gillerthwaite is a narrow tradl of cultivated land, a peninfula on the lake or 
lough, whofe verdure receives additional beauties from the ftony defert with 
which it is environed, where the mountains are barren in the extreme.
This 
little fpot has two cottages upon it, and has no neighbouring habitations to alle-

of human habitations, fequeflered and fhut out for many feafons even from the

THE PARISH OF WORKINGTON 
(in ALLERDALE ward above DERWENT.) 
I N the next place demands our attention.
This, like moft of the fimall feaport 
towns, has not been laid out upon a plan of elegance, or for pleafure, but 
merely for the advantage of thofe concerned in trade.
It is mentioned to us to be 
the place from whence a number of unreclaimable mofs-troopers were (hipped for 
their voluntary banifhment, in v/hich few, and thofe very fmall barks, were 
employed- Here the imprudent Mary Stuart landed, after her flight from 
“ Dundrannon, in Galloway, creduloufly trufling to the protedlion of the infidious 
** Elizabeth.
”t Notwithflanding thofe circumftances, which fliew it was a port 
of fome note in antiquity, and in fad; the chief haven of the county of Cumber- 
land, the reader will recoiled that, in the opening of this work, we flated that, in 
1566, there was only one veflel appertaining to this now opulent county, of fo great 
a burthen as ten tons; and, on a furvey taken of the maritime flrength of the 
county, about twenty years after that period, when England commanded the feas, 
all the veflels which Cumberland could put to fea, amounted only to ten in num- 
ber, and their mariners to an hundred and ninety-eight.
Camden fays — “ After thefe rivers are united, the Derwent falls into the fea at 
“ Workington, famous for the falmon fifliery.
It is now' the feat of the ancient, 
knightly family of the Curwens, defeended from Gofpatric, Earl of Northum- 
“ berland, who took that name by covenant from Ciilwen, a family of Galloway, 
*' the heir whereof they had married.
They have a flately, caflle-like feat ; and

Darwent is a prety creke, wher as fhyppes cum to, wher ys a lytle prety fyfshcr 
” town, cawled IVyrhejiton, and ther is the chefe howle of Sir Thomas Curwyn.” 
From thefe and other teftimonies, it is certain this town cannot boaft much 
importance in antiquity, and that it has arifen from an inferior degree within a 
century.
Some authors have aflerted, that formerly the bay or creek was chiefly re- 
forted to by perfons carrying on an illegal trade : its improvement is moft judicioufly 
defcribed by Mr. Pennant : — The town extends from the caftle to the fea ; it 
confifts of two clufters, one, the more ancient, near the caftle, the other nearer 
the church and pier ; and both contain about four or five thoufand inhabitants: 
they fubfift by the coal trade, which is here confiderable.
The Derwent wafties 
the flcirts of the town, and difcharges itfelf into the fca about a mile weft; on 
each bank, near the mouth, are piers, where the (hips lie ; and the coals are con- 
veycd into them from frames, occafionally dropping into them from the rail- 
“ roads.
Ninety-feven veflels of different burthens, fomeeven of two hundred and 
** fifty tons, belong to this port.” — Such is the account given by that celebrated 
traveller.
The increafe of this place has been very rapid of late years, and many of the 
new buildings are handfome : in the old part of the town the ftreets are narrow 
and the houfes ill built.
The town contains between eleven and twelve hundred 
houfes.
The ground-rents for building are low'er here than in any part of the 
county, being no more than one {billing per yard front and twenty backwards.
— 
The river is navigable for ftiips of four hundred tons burthen.
There are now 
an hundred and fixty velfels belonging to this port, on an average about an hundred 
and thirty tons each; and every fhip of an hundred tons cofts 1500I.
and fo in 
proportion.
The chief trade in export is in coals for Ireland, but fome few are 
taken up here for the eaft country fervice.
The imports, timber, bar-iron, and 
flax.
During the fummer feafon the fituation of the place is delightful ; but the 
town cannot boaft of many elegant buildings, or the ftreets of being well paved.
The number of inhabitants is computed to exceed fix thoufand ; many are wealthy, 
and in general the people are affable and open hearted.
The hall has been almoft entirely rebuilt by the prefent poffefTors, and the 
grounds greatly extended and beautified.
The building was ereded by Mr. Carr, 
architect, of York : the grounds planned by Mr. White of Retford.
The harbour is efteemed one of the fafeft upon this coaft ; the velfels lie fecurc 
from the winds of every quarter.
Great improvements in the quays have been 
lately made; much yet icmains to be done, to give it all the advantages the fituation 
is fo eminently capable of ; and, it is to be hoped, for the fake of the public, fpirited 
exertions will not be wanting.
— At a bar at the entrance of the harbour the fand 
is fometimes troublefome, but much leffened of late years.
The public manufadtories carried on here are of fail-cloth and cordage.
An 
additional ropery is preparing, on a very extended fcale.
An iron-foundery, which 
is carried on at a little diftance, is mentioned in the fequel.
The public buildings are modern ; the church is a handfome ftrudlure, with a 
tower, or fteeple, in the Gothic order.
The infide of the church is neatly finifhed, 
and the altar is ornamented with a painting of our Saviour taken down from the 
crofs.

The living, which is one of the beft in the county, is in the gift of the 
Curwen family.
About half a mile weftward from the town is a fpacious work- 
houfe, which, with the eafements and out-buildings, coft the inhabitants 1600I.
and upwards : it is calculated to take in one hundred and fifty perfons, though the 
number now received there does not exceed twenty, including paupers from Har- 
rington, who are taken as boarders.
The poor rate is collected by poundage 
money, at or about the rate of fix-pence in the pound.
The keeper of the poor- 
houfe is colledlor of all taxes and afieflments, for which he has a yearly falary.
— 
The favings from the poorhoufe have amounted in the firfl year to upwards of two 
hundred pounds.
Too much credit cannot be given to the committee who con- 
dud: this bufinefs, for their care of the poor, and their attention to the intcrefl; of 
the town.
There is a fmall but neat affembly-room, which w'as built at the expence of the 
prefent Mr. Curw'en ; it is well attended during the winter feafon.
Here is alfo a 
playhoufe, to which Mr. Stordy, who is the head of a company of comedians, gave 
a handfome fubfeription.
Among the improvements that have taken place within 
the laft twenty years, are the following: — Firfi, A new fquare in the upper town, 
confifting of about twenty neat houfes.
Here the corn market is held.
— At no 
great diflance is the butchers’ market, where every perfon has a feparate apartment 
and ftall, in the front of which the occupier’s name is put up.
The bridge leading 
from the north was eredled within the laft forty years.
The quays have been 
widened and lengthened confiderably, and the bankings increafed, within twenty- 
years laft paft.
Several of thofe laudable inftitutions, called Friendly Societies, are held here, 
one particularly of women, confifting of upwards of two hundred perfons: Mrs.
Curwen prefides as a member, as well as feveral other very refpediable charadlers.
Very bountiful fublcriptions were made to encourage this inftitution : an annual 
dinner is ferved up on New-year’s-day, when the yearly accounts are fettled, and 
new regulations are made.
The members, when fick, receive a weekly fubfiftence; 
and ten fhillings and fix-pence is allowed out of the fund to every married woman, 
for child-bed money.
All workmen of every defeription, employed under Mr, 
Curwen, pay to the fteward three-pence each every fortnight, at the general pay- 
day, as a fund to fupport the fick, or thofe who happen misfortunes ; to every ten 
pounds raifed by this contribution, Mr. Curwen adds three pounds; the allow- 
ance to each fick and dilabled man is five fhillings a week : as an additional bounty, 
Mr. Curwen pays their dodor.
Here are alfo the Friendly, Honourable, 
and Sailors’ Societies, the advantages derived from which have been very 
beneficial.
The markets are in general well fupplied, but provifions bear a greater price than 
in many other parts of Cumberland ; fhambles meat is feldom under four-pence a 
pound — falmon from four-pence to two-pence a pound.
Cod is plentiful, fome 
years felling at a halfoenny a pound.
Herrings are brought from the Jfle of 
Man, and frequently from Whitehaven, when that market is overftocked.
The coal trade is of the greateft importance.
There are two fets of workings 
almoft contiguous to Workington; nine pits belong to Mr. Curwen, and live to 
S2 Mr.

Mr. Walker, as agent to the truflees of Anthony Bacon, Efq. M.
P. London ; 
they generally (hip, on account of both parties, about an hundred and fifty waggon 
loads per day, (Sunday excepted) of which Mr. Curwen fhips near an hundred 
loads: each waggon contains three Englifh tons of coals, for which the owner 
of the veflel is charged ten fliillings and fix-pence.
The three Englifh tons exceed 
in fome fmall degree two Irilh tons ; the prices at the Irifh markets vary.
The 
profits to the fhipping are very uncertain, no capital of fuch extent makes fo poor 
a return; it barely affords a living profit to the induftrious and careful.
The 
lhares are divided into fmall parts, and are generally taken to oblige fome indivi- 
dual, rather than with the view of much advantage.
The collieries here have 
their obftrudlions, or troubles^ as the miners call them, equally with thofe at 
Whitehaven, and other places on this coafi.
The pits are from forty to ninety 
fathoms in depth, having generally two or three workable bands ; the firft, three 
feet — the fecond, four feet — and the third from ten to eleven feet : the roofs of 
the two former vary ; that of the main coal is of the fineft white freefione, gene- 
rally twenty yards in thicknefs.
Mr. Curwen is at this time employed in 
endeavouring to open the Chapel-bank colliery : the fhafr now finking is upwards 
of twelve feet diameter.
There are two fire-engines upon it ; the pumping- 
engine one of the moft powerful ever erected in Cumberland.
Should this work 
be crowned with fuccefs, the advantage to the town cannot fail of being very great, 
both from the quality and extent of the coal: that heretofore worked has been 
nothing but the out-burft.
Fewer difficulties in thefe new works may reafonably 
be exped;ed, being clear of troubles^ and the coal of a very fuperior quality.
— 
Within thefe few years Mr. Curwen has ered:ed fix fire-engines, which are em- 
ployed both in winding up coals and pumping water.
Infinite are the advantages 
refulting from Meflrs.
Bolton and Watts’ improvements in the fire-engine, which 
can no where be better feen than by thefe eredled here.
In the coal-works are between five and fix hundred perfons employed.
The fire- 
engines have greatly lelTened the number of horfes ufed, which is a matter of much 
advantage both to the public and the proprietor ; and, we may venture to fay, in 
a very few years fire-engines alone will be ufed in the drawing up of coals.
An 
engine fufficient to draw coals from ninety fathoms may be eredted for 600I.
: — 
more than half that fum would in the firft inftance be required to purchafe horfes 
neceffary for the drawing up of coal.
The road from the collieries to the haven belongs to Mr. Curwen, and he re- 
ceives a yearly payment from Mr. Walker for his accommodation.
The coal in 
general is of a good quality, and is fold to the inhabitants at the rate of two 
fhillings for a Angle horfecart load, containing four cuftomary buffiels: the kennal 
coals for one fhilling and four-pence, of the like meafurc.
Mr. Curwen’s pits 
being moft contiguous, fupply the inhabitants chiefly.
Lord Lonfdale’s eftate adjoins upon the eftate of Mr. Curwen, on the north and

Stone for building (few bricks being ufed) is got within a mile of the town, 
the ftratum lies near the lurface, and is eafily wrought : it is of a bluifh white, and

The falmon fifhery in the river Derwent is confiderable.
Mr. Curwen’s tenant 
has the draught from the High Pier and on the Quay; Lord Lonfdale’s tenant 
draws from the Merchants’ Quay up to Cammerton, about four miles in length.
The fea coafl fifliery is farmed of Mr. Curwen by Richard Graham, who gives us 
the following account of his method of taking falmon, which he calls falmon, 
hunling: — “ The falmon hunter is armed with a fpear of three points, barbed, 
“ having a fnaft fifteen feet in length.
When the fifh is left by the tide, inter- 
“ ccptecl by fliallows, or land banks, near the mouth of the river, or at any inlets 
" on the fliorc, where the water remains from one foot to four feet in depth, or 
" w hen their palfiage is obrtrudfed by nets, they fhew where they lie by the agitation 
*' of the pool : when my horfe is going at a fwift trot, or a moderate gallop, belly 
“ deep in the w ater, I make ready my fpear with both hands, and at the fame time 
“ hold the bridle : when 1 overtake the falmon, 1 let go one hand, and with the 
“ other firike with the fpear, and feldom mil's my ftroke, but kill my fifh; then 
'• with a turn of my hand I raife the falmon to the furface of the water, turn my 
“ horfe’s head the readieft way to fhore, and lb run the falmon on to dry land 
“ w ithout difinounting.
In the fifhery I am eftablifhing at Workington, in the 
" proper feafon, by different modes, I can kill, one day with another, one hun- 
“ dred falmon a day ; methods of my own invention I intend to put in pracftice, 
“ w hich never were pradfifed before in any part of the world ; I have tried them, 
“ and they anfwer, and w'hen known, they may become a public good.
I can take 
“ the fifli up at fea in ten fathom water.
A man, in the ordinary way of falmon 
hunting, vfell mounted, may kill forty or fifty in a day ; ten falmon is not a 
" defpicable day’s work for a man and a horfe.
My father was the firfl man, I 
" ever heard of, w ho could kill falmon on horfeback.” Our correfpondent then 
offers a w ager of one hundred guineas that, at this time, he will kill more falmon 
on horfeback in one day, than any three men in England.
— He adds — “ The moft 
noted places for killing falmon on horfeback, are the rivers Eden and Efk, from 
Sandsfield to Bownefs, and fometimes as far to the w'eff as Skinburnefs.
The 
feafons for killing falmon at Workington are in Auguft, September, Odlober> 
and fometimes in February,” 
Mr. Pennant, to whofe judicious obfervations we have fuch frequent occafions to 
refer, fays — “ Near the town is an iron furnace and foundcry ; the ore is brought 
from Furnefs, and the ironfione dug near Harrington.

” mufl: have been a Roman fiation ; for I could difeover no appearance of it, nor 
hear of any Roman coins, inferiptions, or other antiquities found thereabout: 
the Borough Walls, where the fiation is fuppofed to have been, is about a mile 
“ from the town, and not much lefs.
from the river, but on the oppofite fide : a 
** good part of the walls are yet Handing ; by which it appears to have been only 
one of thofe old towns which w’e fo frequently fee in the north, and which fomc- 
times bear the name of Burgh or Brugh.
I faw no appearance of a ditch, no 
remains of other buildings about it, or near it; and, in fiiort, nothing that looked 
like a Roman ftation or town : if it has ever been a Roman fort of any kind, I 
think it mufl: only have been one of thofe fmall exploratory caflclla, which fome 
*' obferve to have been placed along the coaft ; it has a large profpedt into the fea, 
but little towards the land.”§ 
We have before feen that Horfley removes Arbcia to Morefby, which others 
had placed at Workington, on no better authority than the Burrough IValls, about 
" a mile from the town, which are ftill Handing, though no more than one of thofe 
old towers, fo common in the north, and fometimes called Burgh or Brugh; but 
it has no other evidences of its having been a Roman ftation.”t 
The manor-houfe of the family of Curwens, called Workington-Hali., ftands 
upon a fine eminence on the banks of the river Derwent.
It is an elegant

PARISH OF WORKINGTON.
To illuftrate the foregoing genealogical table, we introduce the following 
obfervations — 
CuLDEES.
— Here is another critical remark made by Mr. Toland, wherc- 
with I am not altogether fatisfied ; notwithftanding that he has alTured me, that 
the Irilh notes on his gofpel were as eafy to him as a paternojler could be to father 
Simon.
He fays that the old Culdees were a fort of lay-religious, who had the 
** power of electing their ow'n bifhops or fuperintendants ; and that they were fo 
** named from the original Irilh or antient Scottilh word, ceUede, fignfying 
feparated or efpoufed to God. He acknowledges that George Buchanan had 
the advantage over other hiftorians of his country, in underftanding the antient 
Irilh language; and yet this great mafter of the Irillt tongue explains the word 
“ Culdees by Dei Cultores f as his informer, Hedor Boetius, had done before 
him: whereas Nazarenus himfelf alTures us, that his forefaid etymology cannot 
*'* be denyed by any man who is tolerably verfed in the language of the Irilli, or in 
** their books; one of which, a chronicle moftly in verfe, entitled Pfalter Na'rran, 
was written by a KeldeCy Aonghus latinized Eneas Colideus, about the year 
800.
— To give a full hillory of the Culdees, w^ould take up more room than this 
preface can afford.
— I will only fay, that Mr. Toland’s j unification of thefe 
primitive lay-elders from the pradice of the Alexandrian church in the choice of 
“ their prior or prefident, may be as pertinently alledged for the countenancing of 
Englifli deans and chapters in the execution of their cojige d'ejlires ; and all that 
** Sir James Dairy mple had made evident, from inconteflible authorities, is, that 
the Scottilh Culdees had lands and churches appropriated to them.
And who- 
ever denyed this ?
The fhort fiory of thefe monks is, that they were of the Irifh rule, carried into 
Scotland by St. Columb, and thence difperfed into the northern parts of England.
They were fo named from the black habit which they wore : for culdee fignifies 
as plainly a black monk (from the colour of his hood or coul) as ciilwen fignifies 
a white one.
John Leland mentions two rivers, Clarduyy or black ClaVy and 
Clarwen, or white Clar ; which unite into one dream in cither Cardiganfhire or 
Carmarthenfliire : and there is a famous lake on the confines of my diocefe, 
w'hereinto fall two rivers of the name of Blackwaier ; and out of which a larger 
than both thofe defeends, by that of the Bann or white.
In Mr. Edward 
“ Lhuyd’s Catalogue of Welfh MSS.
which he left behind him colledled and 
** tranferibed in his travels, the firft book is a large colleffion of poems ; whereof 
the tvventy-fourth and twenty-fifth bear the title Cywyah i erchi Milchi du, and 
“ Cytvydh i erchi Milajl wen, i.
e. Symtchral Eligies on a Black Greyhound Dog, 
“ and a White Greyhound Bitch.
— To bring all this home to our prefent purpofe, 
“ I am further to acquaint the reader, that in a cartulary of St. Begh’s, in the Earl of 
“ Oxford’s library, Thomas, fon of Gofpatrick, gives (amongft other benefactions) 
“ Salinum in Culwen.
This Culwen is on the fea coaft in Galloway; and had its 
“ name from a neighbouring rock, which was thought to refemble a white monk.
“ It w'as given by the faid Thomas to Patrick his fon, w'ho (upon the death of his 
elder brother Thomas) fucceeded to his father’s effate in England, and feated 
^ himfelf at Workington, in Cumberland ; but retained the firname of Culwen : 
which 
PARISH OF WORKINGTON.
“ which his pofVerity (Lords of Workington to this day) have changed into 
Curwen.
It was at firft changed by Sir Chriftopher de Culwen, who was twice 
** fherilTof the county, by the name of Culwen, and a third time (in the fame 
reign) by that of Curwen.
Of this family was Hugh Curwen, Archbifhop of 
Dublin ; who, having fat twelve years, and (in the mean time being conftituted 
one of the lords jullices of Ireland) old age growing heavy upon him, he took 
care to be tranllated to Oxford ; and, lingering one year in that fee, he died at 
“ Suinbroch, near Burford, and was there buried in the parifli church, the ifl: of 
" November, ]668.”t 
Ketel granted the church of Mot land to the abbey of St. Mary, York, to which 
grant Chrifliana his wife was a w itnefs.
His eldcft Ibn w’as Gilbert, father of 
William de Lancafter the firll, father of William de Lancafter the fecond, from 
whom defeended in a direeft line the Barons of Kendal.
Waldieve, the brother of 
Gunilda, the wife of Orme, gave to Orme with her in frank marriage the manor 
of Seaton below Derwent, parcel of the barony of Allerdale; as alfo the towns of 
Camberton, Craykfothen, and Flemingby.
And thereupon Orme was fettled at 
Seaton.
The walls and ruins of his houfe w'ere to be feen, as Mr. Denton reports^ 
in his time.
To Gofpatric, fon of Orme, his coufin-german by the mother’s fide, Alan, 
fecond Lord of Allerdale, heir of Waldieve, gave High Ireby, which continued to 
be the pofTeffion of the Curwens, in a younger branch, till it ended in female iffue.
Gofpatric was the firfi: of his houfe that was Lord of Workington, by an ex- 
change made with William de Lancader, who took Middleton, in Weftmorland, 
for Lamplugh and Workington, referving to himfelf and his heirs a yearly rent of 
6d.
payable at Carlifle fair, or a pair of gilt fpurs, w ith homage and foreign fervice, 
as of the barony and caflle of Egre'mont.
Gofpatric gave two parts of the fifhery 
in Derwent to the abbey of Holm Cultram, except Waytcrofi, which he gave to 
the priory of Carlifle ; which was granted over by the priory to Thomas, the fon 
of Gofpatric, upon a referved rent of 7s.
To the above-named Thomas, one Rowland, fon of Ughtred, fon of Fergus,’ 
gave the lordlhip of Culwen in Galloway.
Thomas confirmed the grant of 
Flemingby, made by his father to the convent of Holm Cultram, and gave to that 
houfe the whole fifhings of Derw-ent.
He gave Lamplugh to Robert de Lamplugh 
and his heirs, to be holden by the yeaily prefentment of a pair of gilt fpurs.
He 
gave to his fecond fon, Patric, Culwen in Galloway.
On failure of furviving iffue, 
on the death of his eldeft fon, he gave all his poffeffions to Patric.
Patric thence- 
forth became refident at Workington, and was called Cuhven of Workington.
He 
gave Camerton to his brother Alan, from whom defeended the Camertons.
In the 34th year of King Henry VIII.
by an inquifition taken of knights’ fees 
in Cumberland, it is Bated, that Thomas Curwen, Knight, held the manor of 
Workington of the king by knights’ fervice, as of his caflle of Egremont, by the 
fcrvice of one knight’s fee, 45s.
3d.
cornage, 4s.
fcawake, and puture of two 
ferjeants.
He alfo held the mane.' of Thornthwaite, one-third of the manor of 
Bothill, the manors of Seaton and Camerton, and divers tenements in Gilcroufe, 
Great Broughton, and Dereham.

PARISH OF WORKINGTON, 
150 
Mr. Pennant fays — Obferved to the fouth, on an eminence near the fea, a 
fmall tower, called Holme Chapel^ faid to have been built as a wateh-tower, to 
“ mark the motions of the Scots in their naval inroads.” — Mr. Houfman obferves, 
on this hill the light-houfe (lands : the land (ide is low and marfhy.
The people 
have a tradition, that formerly the fea flowed round it.
Stainburn, a village in this parifh, a mile eaft from Workington, had a chapel 
or oratory built therein, by a prior of St. Bees ; Waldeof having given three 
carucates of land here to the abbey of St. Mary, in York, for the ufe of the cell of 
St. Bees.
King Henry IV.
interfered in the nomination of a chaplain; but, on 
due remonftrance from St. Bees, he difclaimcd the right of the crown.
CuFTONt is a chapelry in this parifh, belonging to Lord Lonfdale.
The vill 
of Clifton was given by William de Mefehines to Waldeof, and was part of the 
polfeflions of the Lucies; from whom the eftate paffed to the family of Egglesfield; 
whofe heirefs, marrying a Berdfey,* transferred the polTefTion to that houfe : after 
fome generations, male ilTue failing in the Berdfeys, Salkeld of Whitehall married 
the heirefs ; and from that family fale was made to Sir James Lowther.§ 
The church of Workington is re<fl:orial.
It was given by Ketel, fon of Aldred, 
with two carucates of land and a mill there, to the abbey of St. Mary, York ; and 
pays 
Magna et Pdrva.
* In the 35th King Henry VIII.
by inqulfition, It was found that WiDIam de Berdfey held the vill 
of Clifton by knights’ fervicc, 2s.

^ The chapel was certified at 3I.
a year But in 1 7 1 7, It was certified that there was then no maintenance 
for a curate, or any divine fervice performed : that formerly every family (forty In number) paid 6d.
to 
one that read prayers and taught the children to read ; and the reftor gave 2I.
a year, and officiated there 
every fixth Sunday.: but that thefe had then ceafed above forty years.
This parlfli lies from Harrington harbour along the fea coaft to the foot of Derwent, from thence up 
the river about four miles and a half.
The average breadth is about two miles ; In all nearly nine fquarc 
miles.
CoMMONS.1 About one-fifth of the whole land, all improveable, rather wet and improper for ffieep, 
fo that the ftock kept thereon does not exceed 500.
Many young cattle are grazed on the commons.
Soil and Produce.] Along the coaft, a traft of light fandy land, about three furlongs In breadth.: 
the reft various in quality, fome parts a fertile, light loam ; other parts inclined to mofs, holding a bluiffi 
clay.
The light foil produces barley, potatoes, and fine oats ; the other fome fmall quantities of wheat 
and other grain.
The principal parts are In meadow and pafture.
Rabbit Warren.] A confiderable one along the fhore.
As large trafts of poor, light foil may be employed with great advantage to IndividuaTs, as well as the 
community at large, for both the fleflr and fur of thefe little animals are of confiderable value, we here 
prefent the reader with an extraft from Mr. Marftrall’s Rural (Economy of Yorkfiiire: — “ There are 
various modes of taking rabbits, but the trap or pit-fall Is by far the inoft eligible.— The trap confifts of 
a large pit or clftern, formed within the ground, and covered with a floor, or with one large falling door, 
with a fmall trap-door towards Its centre.
Into which the rabbits are led by a narrow muce.
“ This trap, on Its firft Introduftion, was fet moftly by a hay-ftack — ^hay being at that time the chief 
winter-food of rabbits ; or, on the outfide of the warren-wall, where the rabbits were obferved to fcratch 
.much In order to make their efcape.
Since the cultivation of turnips as a winter-food for this fpecles of 
ftock has become a pradlice, the fituatlon of the trap has been changed.
“ Turnips being cultivated in an inclofure within the warren, a trap Is placed within the wall of this 
inclofure.
For a night or two, the muce is left open, and the trap kept covered, (with a board or tri- 
angular

to St. Bees.
After ihe diflblution, King Henry VIII.
in the 36th year of his reign, granted the advowfons and right of patronage of the 
redtorial churches of Workington andHarrington to Brockltiby and Dyer ; from 
whom they came in the fame year by fale to the Daldons, and by John Dalfton, 
Efq. of that family, A.
D. 1563, and in the 6th year of Queen Elizabeth’s reign^, 
they were fold to the anceflor of Mrs. Curwen, w ho now polTelTes thole rights.* 
There appears to have been a chauntry at Workington.
Queen Elizabeth, ia 
the 17th year of her reign, granting to Gunfon and Suckly lands called Chapelfiat,^ 
and 
angular rail) in order to give the rabbits the requifite haunt of the turnips j which, having got, the trap 
is bared, and the required number taken.
“ In emptying the ciftern, the rabbits are forted ; thofc which are fat and in feafon are flaughtered | 
thofe which are lean or out of condition, are turned upon the turnips to improve.
“ At the clofe of the feafon the bucks and the does are forted in a fimilar way ; the bucks are 
flaughtered ; the does turned loofe to breed.
One male, I underftand, is confidered as fulficient for fix 
or feven fem.ales ; and the nearer they can be brought to this proportion, the greater ftock of young ones 
may be expedted : it being the nature of the males ( ufinatural as it may appear) to deftroy their young, 
more efpecially, perhaps, when their proportional number is too great.
“ Great precaution is requifite in the ufe of thefe traps.
If too many rabbits be admitted at once, 
and the c’ftein be kept clofe covered only for a few hours, fuffocation and.
inordinate heat take place, 
and the carcafes, atleaft, are fpoiled.
— Many thoufand carcafes have been wafted through this means.— 
The traps are therefore watched; and when the required number are caught, the muce is ftopped, oS 
the trap covered ” 
Fisheries.] For falmon confiderable.
Population.] Computed about 6coo.
Harbour.] Is a veiy good one, but the (hipping He at an inconvenient diftance from the town.
Schools.] One at Workington endowed ; feveral others not endowed.
Quarries, &c.] Of white freeftone ; — mines of coal.
Tithes ] Corn, wool, lan b, &c.
In kind.
Tenures.] Part freehold, other part cuftomary, with a fine certain.
Mr. Curwen lord of the manor’ 
and principal proprietor.
Aspect and General Appearance.] The lands of this parlfti incline a little to the north-weft, 
are rather high, containing few plots of level land.
The coaft is prominent, but not rocky.
Hau^h is a good houfe, belonging to Mr. Curwen.
About Workington-Hall great improvements are 
making in the gardens and adjacent grounds.
Clumps of trees are forming on different points of view, 
fo that in a few years the place will be much beautified.
Workington park contains the whole demefne 
of Harrington, rich land, and well replenifhed with deer.— H ousman’s Notes.
* There was fome confulion relative to this church, King Henry VIII.
having made a fecond grant 
of It to John Bird, Bifhop of Chefter, in exchange for temporaltles, but the prioi grant was eftabllfhed» 
It had again been exchanged with Queen Mary for Childwall and other places.

In the 15th year of her reign, flie 
granted to the fame perfons divers lands and tenements in Workington and in 
Clifton, then late belonging to the monaftery of St. Mary, York.
There is a fchool at Workington, founded and endowed by the Curwen family 
with a flipend of 81 .
a year.
Alfo, feveral Sunday fchools, well attended.
Aji Account of the Rejoicing on the Opening of Chapel-hank Colliery f extraCIed from 
The Cumberland Pacqijet of the i^th and i^lh of Nov. 1794.
We lately mentioned the difcovery of a band of coals at Chapel-bank, near 
Workington, on the 25th ult.
— To celebrate an event, which is confidered of vaft 
importance to that town and neighbourhood, Mr. Curwen has given great enter- 
tainments, of which we have learned the following particulars : — On Friday, about 
noon, the Siferly Society (of which Mrs. Curwen is Lady Patronefs) went in pro- 
ceflion to the pit.
Thefe were follow’ed by the miners, drelTed in uhite flannel 
fuits, — the Honourable Society, — the Friendly Society, — the feamen, — Mrs.
Curwen and another lady in a phaeton, — nine other carriages ; feveral pofl-chaifes 
alfo attended.
— Two marquees were pitched, and wine and cake were provided 
for all who chofe to partake; feveral barrels of ale were alfo broached, and given 
to the populace.
— The proceflion furrounded the pit, which was then named 
Ladies’ Pit, in the prefence of feveral thoufands, who rent the air with three 
times three huzzas.
— A waggon of coals was filled, and drawn by a number of 
men to the fhipping, the proceflion following.
The coals were put on board the 
Thompfon, Captain Henry Tiffin.
— The bells were rung, guns fired, the Ihips 
were -clothed with colours, and feveral beautiful flags, provided by Mr. Curwen, 
were difplayed by the focieties, &c.
— All the workmen, feamen, &c.
had dinners 
provided at different public-houfes.
— At night, there was a general illumination ; 
a ball was given at the alfembly-room, and a fupper at the hall, at which, it is 
faid, upwards of one hundred and fixty ladies and gentlemen were prefent.
— The 
greateft harmony pervaded the whole of this celebration.” 
“ Mr. Curwen’s entertainments, on the occalion mentioned in our lafl, were of 
rhe mofl: liberal kind ; feventy-five ladies and gentlemen dined at Workington- 
Hall, (they w'ere from all parts of the county) on the 14th inflant.
— The company 
at fuppert amounted to one hundred and feventy.
— At the dinner in the aflembly- 
room, on the 17th, there were nearly tw'o hundred guefls ; — and the next day, 
upwards of one hundred (conlifting chiefly of the inhabitants of Maryport and its 
vicinitv) dined at Ewanrigg-Hall.
— Mr. Curwen made a prefent of fifty pounds 
to the feamen of Workington, for the purpofe of forming a Friendly Society of 
Mariners ; and fubicribed five guineas per annum, for the fupport of the Sunday 
fchools at Maryport.”

THE PARISH OF CROSTHWAITE.
F or the fake of connecftion, and to conclude our account of the weftern fide of 
Allerdale above Derwent, we pafled to Workington.
— We now condu6l our 
readers to Crofthwaite parilh, which, in part, lies in Allerdale above Derwent, 
as before obferved ; and we referved the account of Borrowdale until we might 
introduce it with Kefwick, from which place traveller’s in general make their ex- 
curiion to viiit the mines, and view the beauties of the vale.
At the head of Baflenthwaite lake, on the weft fide of the river, lies Tijornth- 
WAiTE, the moft northern part of this parifli,* where there is a chapel of eafe, 
diftant from the mother church about iix miles.
There is a ftipend, or ancient 
falary, belonging to it of 4I.
43.
a year.
It was certified at 4I.
1 6s.
per annum.
Two augmentations by lot have been had, one in 1746, another in 1754; and 
afterwards, in confequence of 200I.
obtained of Lady Gower’s donation, it re- 
ceived 200I.
more from the governors of Queen Anne’s bounty, about the year 
1762 ; by all which means, lands have been purchafed of the yearly value of 30I.
— The vicar of Crofthwaite has the nomination of the curate.
This diftrid; is 
mountainous, but affords fine Creep-walks, and forae fertile, though narrow, vales.
We now entered the beautiful 
VALE OF KESWICK, 
but in the road we pafled, by intercepting hedges and trees, w'e w'ere greatly de- 
prived of the profpedls ; the mountains Skiddaw and Saddleback were clofe upon 
our left, and the lofty fteeps of Whinlaler were to the right.
The church of 
Crofthwaite is a fpacious and handfome edifice, with a good tower, a centre aile 
and two fide ailes, well pew'ed, and kept in good order : the W'hole ftru(fture is 
friezed, or roughcaft, (as the w’orkman’s term is) and whitewaftied.
The road 
from thence to Kefwick is fpacious and M'ell kept j in fo much doth it flatter the 
traveller’s hopes of its leading to a town of equal appearance, that the difappoint- 
ment is not very eafily reconciled when you enter the place, to find moft of the 
houfes low and meanly built : the beft part of the town is obftru( 5 led by gloomy 
and ugly fhambles and a town-houfe ; and there is little appearance of trade or 
manufactory.
The fituation of the vicarage-houfe, to the north of the town, is 
beautiful, and the view from thence, being one of thofe pointed out by Mr. Gray, 
will be noticed in its courfe.
The town of Kefwick ftands upon a fmall river called Bure ; it holds a con- 
fiderable weekly market, in which is expofed to fale a variety of frefh- water fifh, 
as falmon, pike, eels, perch, and trout, — and the fineft mutton in the ifland of 
Great Britaip — Here is a manufadory of coarfe woollen goods, carpets, blankets, 
kerfeys, happings, and fome linen, which occafions a great refort on the market- 
day.
— The trade in leather, which ufed to be confiderable, is much declined.
— A 
cotton-rnill is lately ereded on the river Greeta.
* A cuftomary manor, belonging to Lord Egremont.
The tenants pay arbitrary fiirtis and heriots.

^S^ 
There arc three annual fairs held at Kefvvick, the chief of which is on the 2d 
day of Auguft, called Morlan jair^ in the language of the country.
The inhabit- 
ants have a faying, “ Morlan fluid ne'er did guid” it being a rainy fcafon of the 
year, and they exped; a flood.
From its romantic fituation, a vaft: concourfe of people refort hither on pleafurc 
parties in the fummer; Mr. Crofthwaite, who has a mufeum, or repofitory of 
curiofities, which is vifited by almofl: every traveller, keeps a regifter of the names 
of fuch perfons as he has the honour of exhibiting his rooms to, and no lefs than 
1540 perfons of rank and fafhion were there in the year 179J, being the greatcfl: 
number in atiy one year fince its inftitution.
It is to be lamented for this part of 
the county, that the lands are chiefly held under Greenwich Hofpital, which dif- 
courages purchafers, or the examples of Lord William Gordon and Jofeph 
Pocklington, Efq. would, perhaps, be followed by many people of fortune, and 
confequently the country would be confidcrably improved and enriched.* 
Here 
* The pari{h regiller of Crofthwaite is very imperfe(ft.
— In 1567, there were 90 children baptized— 
in 1 652, 80 children — and in 1 790, they had begun to baptize at the chapels of eafe — 48 were baptized 
at the mother church — at Boirowdale chapel 12 — Newlands chapel 5 — Thornthwait 9 — St. Johns 13 
—and at Wythburn 5 — Total 92.
The parilh is computed to be 12 miles in length, and 7 in breadth ; 
and, on the loth of Auguft, 1793, on taking the number of Inhabitants, they were found to be 3020, 
Kefwick numbering 1093, Borrowdale 361.
The greateft mortality that appears in the regifter was 
in 1623, when 258 were interred.
The regifter is imperfedl in the years of the plague ; there is no- 
regifter for the year 1665, and for 3 or 4 years about that period, when fuch numbers died at London.
Of the above number of inhabtants, 2971 are of'the eftabliftied church, 45 Prefbyterians, and 4 Quakers.
This is a rainy climate ; the average quantity of rain fallen at Kefwick for the laft five years, is 68 
inches per year ; — in the year 1789, 72 inches and a quarter ; in 1790, 73 inches and three quarters t 
and in 1791, 72 inches and a half ; whereas the average fall at London for 40 years together was only 
22 inches.
— The modes of agriculture are much improved within the laft 40 years : the Incceafe of pro- 
duft in grain is fivefold in turnips and potatoes near twentyfold.
— Eighty pair of looms are generally 
kept at work in Kefwick.
— The date upon the bell at Kefwick maiket-houfe is 1001 : there is a tradi- 
tion that It was brought from Stable-Hill, or Lord’s Kland.
An account was taken of the number of ftieep kept in this parlfli, on an average for the laft three 
years, when it appeared that they exceeded 30,000, of which Borrowdale had gooo.
There are five ftrongholds within five or fix miles of Kefwick, which have the names of caftles : 
Castle Crag, three quarters of a mile fouth of Southwaite, In Naddle, S.
E. by S.

To the north fide is a precipice, called 
Iron Crag.

Two wells have been difeovered, feveral kinds of freeftone, leaden vefiels, an iron pot, and 
the iron head of very large halbert, with a date of 1684, now in Mr. Crofthwalte’s mufeum.
A great 
quantity of pebbles were found about fix years ago, fuppofed to be depofited there to annoy an enemy.

The 
Of Antiquities found in this neighbourhood, we have the following account : 
Part of a Roman lachrymal, found under a barrow of Hones on Kefwick fell.
Four flint battle-axes ; one found on the fide of Langftreth, in Borrowdale ; another at Gafgarth, in 
Buttennere ; another near BIrkby ; and the fourth on ploughing in Baflenthwaite common.
Celtic brafs inftruments ; one found on St. Herbert’s Ifland j another on Beirier Knettles ; and 
another in a peatmofs in St. John’s vale.
Several pieces of Roman pavement, which led along the north fide of St. John’s to Petriana.
A Roman mill, ploughed up in a field near Baffenthwaite.
A millftone of uncommon materials, found at fome little diftance from Caftle Crag.
A foffil, refembling lava, dug out of the fide of Latrig, with fome w'ood afhes, taken from under a 
tumulus of earth.
There are about 40 tumuli on the fides of Latrig, many on Swinefide and the lower 
parts of Skiddaw.
No human remains have been dil'covered therein.
Three teeth of the buffalo, found in Baffenthwaite park, and two found near Kefwick.
Thefe curiofities are' lodged in Mr. P.
Crofthwaite’s mufeum, to whom the Editors owe acknowledg- 
ments for his communications relative to Kefwick ; who gives the following account of himfelf and 
produftions : — 
A fliort account of fome of the works and inventions of Mr. Peter CroJlhn.va!te, a native of the parifli 
of Crofthwaitc, who, after having ferved his country twenty years, as a naval commander in the Indies, 
retired to his native place upon a fmall penfion.
In the year 1779, he began to colleft curiofities (to 
add to thofe he had brought from India) for a public mufeum.
The better to enable him to carry on 
this projedl, he furveyed the lakes with much accuracy, got them engraved, and has employed the profits 
arifing from the fale of the maps in purchafing cuiiollties, and in fearch of foflils, plants, antiques, &c.
making and repairing roads for the benefit of the tourlft; ftudying ufeful inventions, and making models 
of them : and, by the help of many valuable donations of curious articles from public-fpirlted friends, he 
has brought together, in the fpace of twelve years, a valuable colledlion.
Of his ufeful inventions, the 
following are fpecimens : — the firft is a machine with which he aftually meafures inacceflible diftances 
from one ftation, and which has always been looked upon as impoffible to accomplifh.
Second, He has 
gathered in the neighbourhood of Kefwick twelve mufical llones, on which he plays tunes.
Third, He 
has difeovered a method of procuring good and wholefome water for man and beaft, in many fitoations 
where it is much wanted.
Fourth, A machine for faring people from fires in great towms, and other 
fituations.
Fifth, A method of curing near half the fmokey chimneys in England.
Sixth, A machine 
for taking landfcapes by rule.
Seventh, A fwinglng machine for the benefit of health.
Eighth, A 
portable bathing machine.
Ninth, A ready and very ufeful roaJling machine.
Tenth, A machine for 
faving (hips and men in tempeftuous weather, and in cafe of fprlnging a leak at fea.
We are forry to obferve that, in fo fmall a place as Kefwick, there is a rivalfhip between Mr» 
Crofthwaite and Mr. Hutton, the latter alfo exhibiting a mufeum.
A dlvifiori of the rarities, curiofities, 
and antiques, gathered in this country, is a great difappointment to the traveller, -whofe leifure perhaps 
will not permit him to vifit both repofitories, or whofe particular purftiits are dlfappointed by not finding 
the objects of his tafte and euriofity arranged together and in order.
Thefe gentlemen have been 
equally generous to us, in permitting inferiptions to be copied and drawings taken, and p'refenting us 
with a valuable colleftlon of Cumbrian foflils, which are under the infpedtion of Dr. Walker, Profeflbr 
of Natural Hifliory in the Unlverfity of Edinburgh, who has already favoured us with an analyfis of fome 
fent to us by Mr. Crofthwaite, which fliall be hereafter inferted.
— Mr; Hutton has colledted many rare 
plants, with which, and foflils, &c.
&c.
he furnifhes the inquifitive naturallft.
He has found Epimediu?n 
/Hpinuni, a plant not before this difeovered in Great Britain.
They appear to us Induftrious and obliging 
men, and both meriting encouragement, which makes us the more heartily lament the feemlng oppofitlou 
of the parties.

In fome part of the Interval between the years 1745 and 1750, and in the reign of King George II.
was feen by fome boys, &c.
In their return from fchool, about five or fix o’clock in the evening, at 
Portinfcale, near Kefwick, the extraordinary phenomenon of feveral parheliat or mock funs.
There 
muft have been fix at leaft In their count with the real fun ; but there might have been feven, including 
the fun in that number ; for lefs than fix could not have been to anfwer the circular form or figure 
they made, which Is well remembered, the fun In the middle, as fuppofed ; for the parhelia could 
not eafily be diftinguilhed from the fun itfelf, In point of brightnefs, or otherwife, than by the time of 
the day.
The parhelia were not accompanied by any corona, or luminous circles, fo far as I can at prefent well 
recolleft ; neither, certainly, had they any luminous cones at all.
In any dlreftion whatfoever.
The feveral parhelia were all clearly and dlftlndtly feen, (as was the fun, or that In the middle) at the 
fame time, above the horizon, at a confiderable and apparently equal diftance from the fun In the centre, 
and equidiftant from each other, to all appearance.
A certain young woman pafling by at the time, with a mixture of furprize and awe In her countenance, 
beckoned to us in a fhoemaker’s (hop, exclaiming, “ Such ajight as never ’was feen /” — Both mafter and 
man immediately throwing afide their ftraps, laft, and awl, were followed by the boys, in eager hurry to 
fee the wonderful fight.
We Hood gazing at this grand dlfplay of the mimic fport of nature for feme time.
It might be for 
feveral minutes, (to fpeak within compafs) till the parhelia began to fade, and prefently after vanilhed, 
leaving the real fun without a competitor, the unrivalled monarch of the Ikies.
Some packs of clouds, and black as thofe w’e ufually call thunder clouds, were towards the north.
The 
edge of thefe muft have been nearly over our heads, as the feenery was accompanied by the gentleft fall 
of a few gliftening drops of rain ; but thefe were quickly over, the air being warm, flill, and calm.

Upon a comparifon, the difference between tliefe two phasnomena at different times ftands as follows :

Caffini’s was in January ; this in fome of the w-armcr months and longer days : the two parhelions of

Thefe had no cones at all.

From a ftiort defeription of the beauties of Kefwick, written by the late Di% 
Brow n, which we had before us on our firft vifit to this place, we were impatient 
to view the beauties of the feene."* 
From 
* Dr. Bronvu’s Letter, printed at Newcajlle in the Year 1767.
“ In my way to the north from Hagley, I paffed through Doredale; and, to fay the truth, was 
“ dhappointed in it.
When I came to Buxton, 1 vifited another or two of their romantic feenes; but 
“ thefe are inferior to Dovedale.
They are but poor miniatures of Kefwick ; which exceeds them more 
“ in grandeur than I can give you to imagine, and more, if potfible, in beauty than in grandeur.
“ Inftead of a narrow Hip of valley, which is feen at Dovedale, you have at Kefwick a vail amphi- 
“ theatre, in circumference about twenty miles ; inftead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten 
“ miles round, of an oblong form, adorned with variety of wooded lllands.
The rocks indeed of Dove- 
“ dale are finely wild, pointed and irregular ; but the hills are both little and unanlmated ; and the 
* margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, moiafs, and brufliwood.
But at Kefwick you will 
“ on one fide of the lake fee a rich and beautiful landfcape of cultivated fields, rifing to the eye in fine 
“ inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily difperfed ; and climbing the adjacent hills, fhade above 
“ fhade, in the moft various and pidlurefque forms.
On the moft oppofite fhore, you will find rocks and 
“ cliffs of ftupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, fome of them a thoufand 
“ feet high, the woods climbing up their fteep and fhaggy fides, where mortal foot never yet approached.
“ On thefe dreadful heights the eagles build theii nefts : a variety of waterfalls are feen pouring from 
“ their fummits, and tnmbling in vaft fheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible mignificence : while 
“ on all fides of this immenfe amphitheatre the lofty mountains rife round, piercing the clouds in flrapes 
“ as fpiry and fantaftic as the very rocks of Dovedale.
To this I muft add the frequent and bold proje- 
“ ftion of the cliffs Into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories : In other parts they finely retire 
“ from it, and open in abrupt chafms or clifts, through which at hand, you fee rich and cultivated vale's, 
“ and beyond thefe, at various diftanecs, mountains rifing over mountains; among which new profpe<St8 
“ prefent themfelves in mift, till the eye is loft In an agreeable perplexity : 
“ Where adlive fancy travels beyond fenfe, 
“ And pidlures things unfeen.
“ Were I to analyfe the two places into their eonftituent principles, I fliould tell you that the full

From Cock-fhoot-hiil, we had our firft profpe^l of the bke, which, though 
inferior in fize to Ullfvvater, is yet very different in the general features of its 
“ infenfibly lofing themfelves in an azure mift.
I would remark the contrail of light and fhade produced 
“ by the morning and evening fun; the one gilding the weflern, and the other the eallern Ilde of this 
immenfe amphitheatre ; while the vail Ihadow, projeAed by the mountains, buries the oppofite part in 
a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate.
The natural variety of colouring which 
“ the feveral objedls produce is no lefs wonderful and pleafing : the ruling tints in the valley being thofc 
of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, arKing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the 
** grafs and corn fields ; thefe are finely contrafted by the grey rocks and clifi's ; and the whole heightened 
** by the yellow ftreams of light, the purple hues, and milty azure of the mountains.
Sometimes a ferene 
air and clear fley difclofe the tops of the highell hills ; at others, you fee clouds involving their fummits, 
** refting on their fides, or defeending to their bafe, and rolling among the valleys, as in a vail furnace.
When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder ; then, too, 
“ the clouds are feen In vaft bodies fweeping along the hills in gloomy greatnefs, while the lake joins the 
tumult, and tofies like a fea : but in calm weather the whole feene becomes new ; the lake Is a perfect 
mirror; and the landfcape in all Its beauty, Iflands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are- feen 
** Inverted, and floating on Its furface.
I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, If you dare 
** approach the ridge, a new fccne of aflonifhment prefents Itfelf ; where this valley, lake, and iflands, 
** feem lying at your feet ; where the expanfe of water appears dimlnifhed to a little pool, amidll the vail 
Immeafurable objefts that furround It ; for here the fummits of mote diflant hills appear above thofc 
you have already feen, and tiling behind each other in fucceffive ranges, and azure groups of craggy 
** and broken fleeps, form an Immenfe and awful pifture, which can only be expreffed by the image of a 
tempefluous fea of mountains.
— Let me now conduft you down again to the valley, and conclude with 
one circumftance more ; which Is, that a walk by ftlll moon light (at which time the dlllant waterfalls 
•* are heard in all their variety of found) among thefe inchaating dales, opens a feene of fuch delicate 
** beauty, repofe, and folemnity, as exceeds all defcriptlon.”

Mr. Pennant gives the following defeription of this lake : “ Arrive near the Elyfium of the north, the 
“ vale of Kefwick, a circuit, between land and water, of about twenty miles.
From an eminence above, 
“ command a fine bird’s-eye view of the whole of the broad fertile plain, the town of Kefwick, the white 
“ church of Crofthwaite, the boailed lake of Derwentwater, and the beginning of that of Baffenthwaite, 
“ with a full fight of the vaft circumjacent mountains that guard this delicious fpot.
“ Take boat on the water, which makes this place fo juftly celebrated.
The form Is Irregular, ex- 
“ tending from north to fouth about three miles and a half, the breadth one and a half.
The greateft 
“ depth is twenty feet, in a channel running fiom end to end, probably formed by the river Derwent,.
“ which paffes through and gives name to the lake.
“ The views on every fide arc very different : here all the poflible variety of alpine feenery is exhibit-

“ contrafted with others whofe fmooth and verdant fides fw'elling into immenfe aerial heights, at once 
pleafe and furprlfe the eye.
“ The two extremes of the lake afford moft dlfcordant profpedls : the fouthern is a compofition of all

fells of Borrowdale frown 
“ on it like a hardened tyrant.
“ Each boundary of the lake feems to take part with the extremities, and emulates their appearance ;  
“ the fouthern varies in rocks of different forms, from the tremendous precipices of the Lady’s Leap, 
“ the broken front of the Falcons next to the more diftant concave or curvature of Lodore, an extent of'

the gorge of Borronudale.

The^village

“ On the fummit of Caftle-crag, are the remains of a fort ; and much frcellone, both red and white,

Several vejfels are cut in the rock.
A lead pan, with an iron bow, was 
lately taken up there ; two maifes of fmelted iron were found in the ruins, probably taken from the

All Borrowdale^ and the reiiory of Crqjihwaite, were

( 1607) by Thomas Thurland and David Holchfteter, a German of Aufpurg ; though known many ages, 
before, as appears from the clofe rolls of Henry III.
About thefe there was a memorable trial between 
Queen Elizabeth and Thomas Percie, Earl of Northumberland, lord of the manour ; but, by virtue of

So far is it from being true what Cicero has faid In his Epiftlcs to Atticus, it is well

Gibson’s Camden.
To this chief and varied feene, we cannot pay too great attention, or colleft too many defcriptions, 
given by popular writers, to enhance Its merit.
The Ode to the Genius of the Lakes, after haihng that fancied exiftence, proceeds, 
“ The Mufe, who ever loves to trace 
'Whate’er Is fair on Nature’s face.
And fee, though long with clouds o’ercaft, 
Negleiled worth ftiliie forth at laft.
And Ample tafte and truth prevail.
Greets thee well, and bids thee hail !” &c.
Long e’er thefe happier days of genuine tafte, 
'Which give thy magic feene encomiums due.
Through many an age, with like enchantment grac’d.
Thy rills kept tinkling, and thy thickets grew.” 
The author of the poem of Killarney, (the Rev. John Leflie) addreftlng Nature, proceeds, 
Be Nature, thou my guide 
Where’er we rove, thro’ foreft, lake, or wild.
Bring with thee Fancy, thy creative child.
And gay affociate ; apteft ftie to tell 
The haunt of Dryad, and the Echo’s cell ; 
Where dwells the mountain Genius, where the wood’s.
And where the Naiads of the filver floods ; 
Where, feldom feen, the rural powers retreat.
The friends and guardians of thy facred feat.” 
We will now purfue Mr- Gilpin’s route.
“ By this time we approached Kefuick (by the Amblefide road) and from the defeent of Caftlc-hlll, 
at about two miles diftance, had an extenfive view of the whole country around that celebrated feene oF 
romantic beauty.
“ Before us lay a plain, many leagues In circumference, divided into large portions, each of which is 
floated by a lake : Dernnentiuater overfpreads the nearer, and Bajfnthnssaite •water the more diftant.
— 
Surrounding the whole, rifes a vaft chain of mountains, and towering over them all, on the eaftern fide of 
the ifthmus, Hands the mountain of Skiddanu.
We heard too much of this mountain, to meet it pro-

Mr. Pocklington, who has expended a large fum, not only to ornament the fcene, 
but alfo in fupport of annual feftivals, to induce many vilitors to refort to Kefwick.
The name of this ifland feems to be derived from its having anciently appertained 
to Fountain’s Abbey.
After the diffolution of that religious houfe, with other 
lands, the ifland was granted out by King Henry VIII.
to one John Williamfon : 
the Ponfonbies of Hale were lately proprietors of this fweet fpor, now the fummer

But If the mountain difappointed us, the fcene over which It pre* 
fided, went beyond our Imagination.
“ Juft as we arrived at the brow of the hill, with the fcenery of the two lakes and their accompany- 
ments before us, the fetting fun burft forth in a glow of fplendour.
“ Kefwick is the firft town we meet with, on our entrance into Cumberland ; and, though a place of 
no confequence.
Is, however, much fuperlor to Amblefide.
“ Before we examined the particulars of this grand fcene, we took a general view of the whole from 
its northern (hore ; which is the only part unblockaded by mountains.
This Is the ifthmian part, which 
joins the valley of Derwentwater, with that of BalTenthwalte.
“ The lake of Derwent or Kefwick lake, as It Is generally called.
Is contained within a circumference 
of about ten miles ; prefenting itfelf in a circular form, though In fa£t It is rather oblong.
Its area is 
interfperfed with four or five iflands : three of which only are of confequence, Lord’s Ifland, Vicar’s 
Ifland, and St. Herbert’s Ifland : but none of them is comparable to the Ifland of Windermere, in point 
citlier of fire or beauty.” Gilpin’s Tour, vol.

And fay, ihio’ thy diurnal round.
Where, great fpedlator, haft thou found 
Such folemn foul-inviting (hades,.
Ghoftly dells, religious glades ?
Where Penitence may plant its meek abode.
And hermit Meditation meet its God.
Now by the margin of yon glaffy deep 
My penfive vigils let me keep , 
There, by force of Runic fpells, 
Shake the grot where Nature dwells ; 
And in the witching hour of night, 
Whilft thy pale filter lends her (hady light, 
Summon the naked wood-nymphs to my fight.
Trembling now with giddy tread, 
Prefs the mofs of Gowdar’s head ; 
But lo, where fits the bird of Jove, 
Couch’d in his eyrie far above ; 
Oh lend thine eye, thy pinion lend.
Higher, yet higher let me (till afeend ; 
’Tis done ; my forehead fmites the (kies.
To the laft fummit of the cliff I rife ; 
I touch the facred ground.
Where ftep of man was never found ; 
I fee all Nature’s rude domain around.
Peaee to thy empire, queen of calm defires, 
Health crown thy hills, and plenty robe thy vales; 
May thy groves wave untouch’d by wafteful fires.
Nor commerce crowd thy lakes with fordid fails !

In the vale, at this 
point of view, the church of Crofthwaite, with feveral houfes, (hewed their white 
fronts, over which the mountains to the right looked at once (lupendous 
and gloomy, as they flood lhadowed with the clouds.
Skiddaw railed his folemn 
head, w'ith a peaked front overlooking Saddleback and Ullock,t together with a 
range of mountains (Iretching out towards the north : whilfl, on the other hand, 
the rocks and mountains on the water of BalTenthwaite formed the other wing of 
a lofty avenue, extending into the diftant plains.
We coafted the right hand (ide of the lake, where the hills, gradually retiring 
from its margin, rife to their lummits, covered with herbage.
Here we had a 
view up the little valley of Newlands, which winds about the feet of the moun- 
tains; and, with the verdure of fmall inclofures of grafs ground, refrefhed the 
eye, which had laboured with upftretched looks over the vaft heights that (hut it

We landed at St. Herbert's Islanb,* which contains about four acres of land, 
now covered with young trees, famous for being the reiidence of St. Herbert, a 
prieft and confelTor, who, to avoid the intercourfe of man, and that nothing might 
withdraw his attention from unceafing mortification and prayer, chofe this ifland 
* “ If a painter were defirous of ftudying the whole circumference of the lake, from one ftation, St.
Herbert’s Ifland is the fpot he ftiould chufe, from whence, as from a centre, he might fee it in rotation.
I have feen a fet of drawings taken from this ifland, which were hung round a circular room, and 
intended to give a general idea of the boundaries of the lake.
But as no reprefentation could be giveiv 
of the lake itfelf, the idea was loft, and the drawings made but an awkward appearance.
“ As the boundaries of this lake are more mountainous than thofe of Windermere, they of courfe 
afford more romantic fceneiy.
But though the whole ftiore, except the fpot where we flood, is incircled.
with mountains ; they rarely fall abruptly into the water t which is girt almoft round with a margin of 
meadow — on the weftern fliores efpecially On the eallern, the mountains approach nearer the water ; 
and in fome parts fall perpendicularly into it.
But as we flood viewing the lake from its northern fhores, 
all thefe marginal parts were loft, and the mountains (though in faft they deferibe a circle of twenty 
miles, which is double the circumference of the lake) appeared univerfally to rife from the water’s edge.
Along its weftern fhores, on the right, they rife fmooth and uniform ; and are therefore rather lumpifh.
The more removed part of this mountain line is elegant ; but in fome parts it is difagreeably broken.
“ On the eaftern fide, the mountains aie both grander and more pidturefque.
The line is pleafing ;• 
and is fiUed with that variety of objedls, broken ground, rocks, and wood, which, being well combined, 
take from the heavinefs of a mountain ; and give it an airy lightnefs.
The front llereen (if we may lo call.
a portion of a circular form) is more formidable than either of the fides.
But its line Is lefs elegant than 
that of the eaftern llcreen.
The fall of Lodore, which adorns that part of the lake, Is an objedl of no 
confequence at the diftance we now flood.
But in our Intended ride, ws propofed to take a nearer vievr 
of it.
“ Of all the lakes In thefe romantic regions, the lake we are now examining feems to be moft ge- 
nerally admired.
It was once moft admirably charafterized by an Ingenious perlon, (Mr. Avifon, late 
organift at Newcaftle) who, on his firft feeing it, erled out, “ Here ii beauty indeed — Beauty lying in th^ 
lap of Horror I" 
“ In the firft place, its form, which, In appearance.
Is circular, is left Interefting than the winding 
fweep of Winderrnere, and fome other lakes ; which, lofmg themfelves in vaft reaches, behind fome cape 
or promontory, add to their other beauties, the varieties of diftance and perfpedlive.
Some people objedl 
to this, as touching rather on the charadler of the river.
But does that Injure Its beauty ?
And yet I 
believe there are very few rivet s which form fuch reaches as thofe of Windermerei 
“ To the formality of its fliores, may be added the formality of Its iflar.ds.
They are round, regular, 
and fimllar fpots, as they appear from moft points of view ; formal In their iitiiation, as well as in their 
fhape ; and of little advantage to the feene.
The iflands of Windermere are in themfelves better fhaped; 
more varied ; and, uniting together, add beauty, eontraft, and- a peculiar feature to the whole.” 
Gilpin’s Tour.
Mr. Gough, in his Additions to Camden, gives the following remarks — “ The Derwentwater family 
took their name from the place where they were feated from the reign of Edw. I.
Sir Nicholas Radcllffe 
of Dilllon, in the county of Northumberland, Knight, married the heireft of the family In the reign of 
King Henry VI.
and his defeendant, Francis, was created by James II.
Baron of Dilllon, Vifeount 
Langley and Radcliffe, and Earl of Derwentwater ; all which titles were forfeited, with his eftate and 
life, by his fon James, beheaded on Towerhill, 1716, for engaging In the rebellion.
The eftate amounting 
to 20,oocl.
a year, including the mines, was veiled in trullees for the fupport of Greenwich Hofpital,., 
hit rejiored on the reverfal of the attainder, 117.” — To this aflertlon, Mr. Gough, by a mark of annota- 
tion, refers to G, his proper initial- -Pennant 41 — Burn, IL 77.
79b from which references we do not 
©btain any fuch information.
“ On the north fide of the lake, is a fait fpring, once belonging to the monks of Furnefs.” 
“ The three iflands on this circular lake are finely dilpofed.
The principal is the Lord’s Ifland, about

The fcene around him was well adapted to the feverity of his 
religious life — he was furrounded with the lake, from whence he received his diet.
On every hand, the voice of waterfalls excited the mofl folemn flrains of medita- 
tion — rocks and mountains were his daily profpecl, infpiring his mind with ideas 
of the might and majefly of the Creator; and were fuitable to his difpofition of 
foul; Silence feemed to rake up her eternal abode : from the (ituation of this ifland, 
nature hath given one half of the year to impetuous hurricanes and florms.
— Here 
this reclufe eredted an hermitage, the remains of which appear to this day, being 
built of done with mortar, formed into two apartments.
The outward one about 
twenty feet long and fixteen feet broad ; has probably been his chape!
; the other, 
of narrower dimenlions, his cell.
Bede, in his Hiftory of the Church of England, writes thus of our faint: 
“ There was a certain pried, revered for his uprightnefs and peifedl: life and 
manners, named Hereberte, who had a long time been in union with the man 
“ of God (St. Cuthbert of Earn Ide) in the bond of fpiritual love and frienddiip.
" For living a folitary life in the ide of that great and extended lake, from w hence 
proceeds the river of Derwent ; he ufed to vilit Sr. Cuthbert every year, to rc- 
ceive from his lips the dodtrine of eternal life.
When this holy pried heard of 
" St. Cuthbert’s coming to Lugubalia, he came after his ufual manner, defiring to 
be comforted more and more with the hopes of everlading blide by his divine 
“ exhortations.
As they fate together, and enjoyed the hopes of heaven, among 
“ other things the bifhop faid, “ Remember, brother Herbert, that w’hatfoever ye 
“ have to fay and afk of me, you do it now', for after we depart hence, w e fhall not 
meet again, and fee one another corporally in this world : for I know well the 
time of my diflblution is at hand, and the laying adde of this earthly tabernacle 
“ draweth on apace.” When Herberte heard this, he fell down at his feet, and with 
“ many fighs and tears befeeched him, for the love of the Lord, that he would not 
“ forfake him, but to remember his faithful brother and adbeiate, and make inter- 
cefTion w ith the gracious God, that they might depart hence into heaven together, 
“ to behold his grace and glory whom they had in unity of fpirit ferved on earth: 
“ for you know' I have ever ftudied and laboured to live according to your pious 
" and virtuous inftrudions ; and in whatfoever I offended or omitted, through 
ignorance and frailty, I ftraightway ufed my earned: efforts to amend after your 
“ ghodly counfel, will, and judgment.” At this earned and affectionate requefl 
of Herbertes, the bidiop went to prayer, and prefently being certided in fpirit 
that his petition to heaven would be granted, — “ Arife,” faith he, “ my dear 
brother, weep not, but let your rejoicing be with exceeding gladnefs ; for the 
“ great mercy of God hath granted unto us our prayer.” The truth of which 
promife and prophecy was well proved in that which enfued : for their fepara- 
tion w’as the lad that befel them on earth ; on the fame day, which was the J9th 
day of March, their fouls departed from their bodies, and W’ere draight in union

oratory or chapel might be kept in repair after his death, as a particular veneration 
appears to have been paid by the religious of after ages to this retreat, and the 
memory of the faint.
There is a variance in the accounts given by authors, of the 
day of the faint’s death ; Bede fays the 19th day of March ; other authors on the 
20th day of May, A.
D. 687 ; and, by the following record, it fhould appear that 
the 13th day of April was obferved as the folemn anniverfary.

offices.

Thefe fcenes have exercifed much poetic genius — The following epifode is taken from a poem lately 
publlihed, entitled “ The Pleafures of Memory — 
“ Once, and domeftic annals tell the time, 
{Preferv’d In Cumbria’s rude romantic clime) 
When Nature fmil’d, and o’er the landfcape threw 
Her richeft fragrance, and her brighefl; hue, 
A blithe and blooming Fore fter explored 
Thofe nobler fcenes Salvator’s foul adored ; 
I'he rocky pafs half hung with fliaggy wood.
And the cleft oak flung boldly o’er the flood ; 
Eager to bid the mountain echoes wake, 
And fhoot the wild-fowl of the filver lake.
High on exulting wing the heath-cock rofe, 
And blew his flirill blaft o’er perennial fnows ; 
When the rapt youth, recoiling from the roar, 
Gazed on the tumbling tide of dread Lodore ; 
And thro’ the rifted cliffs, that fcal’d the fley, 
Derwent’s clear mirror charmed his dazzled eye, 
Each ofier Ifle, Inverted on the wave.
Thro’ morn’s gray mift its melting colours gave ; 
And, o’er the cygnet’s haunt, the mantling grove 
Its emeral’d arch with wild luxuriance wove.
Light as the breeze that brufh’d the orient due.
From rock to rock the young adventurer flew ; 
And day’s lafl funfliine flept along the fhore, [wore.
When, lo !
an ambufh’d path the fmlle of welcome 
Imbowering fhrubs with verdure veil’d the fley, 
And on the mufle-rofe fhed a deeper dye ; 
Save when a mild and momentary gleam [ftream.
Glanced from the white foam of fome flickered 
O’er the ftill lake the bell of evening toll’d.
And on the moor the fhepherd peun’d his fold ; 
And on the green hill’s fide the meteor played.
When, hark !

It ceafed — yet ftill in Florlo’s fancy fung.
Still on each note his captive fpirit hung ; 
Till o’er the mead a cool fequefter’d grot, 
From Its rich roof a fparry luftre (hot.
A cryftal water crofs’d the pebbled floor.
And on the front thefe Ample lines It bore : 
Hence away, nor dare Intrude !

Mufing Memory loves to dwell, 
With her After Solitude.
Far from the bufy world fhe flies.
To tafte that peace the world denies.
Entranced flie fits ; from youth to age.

And noting, ere they fade away.
The little lines of yefterday.

When lo, the genius of this ftill retreat !
Fair was her form — but who can hope to trace 
The penfive foftnefs of her angel-face ?

Thofe finer features of the feeling heart, 
Thofe tend’rer tints, that fhun the carelefs eve.

Wc arrived at the borders of Manisty Meadow,* a flat of a few acres at the 
feet of the mountains, where our boat anchored, that we might enjoy the pleafures 
of the fituation; to the left, the neareft objedt was a wooded ifland, edged with 
rocks; behind which Brandelow parks, and oaken groves, drell: in the deepefl: 
green, covered the hills which arole immediately from the margin of the lake, and 
from thence ftretched up the foot of Calbels mountain, which lay fo near us, that 
it required the eye which viewed its fummit to be turned almofl; diredlly upwards: 
And, with view-lialloo, roufed the dreaming hound, 
That tung, by ftarts, his deep ton’d mulic round.
Long by the paddock’s humble pale confin’d, 
His aged hunters courfed the viewlefs wind : 
And each, with glowing energy pourtray’d, 
The far-fam’d triumphs of the field difplay’d ; 
Ufurp’d the canvas of the crowded hall.
And chas’d a line of heroes from the wall.
There flept the horn each jocund echo knew, 
And many a fmilc, and many a ftoiy drew !
High o’er the hearth his foreft trophies hung,.
And their fantallic branches wildly flung.
How would he dwell on each vafl antler there !
This dalh’d the wave, that fann’d the mountain air.
Each, as it frowned, unwritten records bore, 
Of gallant feats, and fellivals of yore.
But why the tale prolong ?

His darling Julia, on the ftranger fmil’d.
Her little arts a fretful fire to pleafe, 
Her gentle gaiety, and native eafe.
Had won his foul — but, ah !
few days had pafs’d, 
Ere his fond vifions prov’d too fweet to laft.
When evening ting’d the lake’s etherial blue, 
And her deep fliades irregularly threw ; 
Their fliifting fail dropp’d gently from the cove, 
Down by St. Herbert’s confecrated grove ; 
Whence erft; the chanted hymn, the taper’d rlte,^ 
Amus'd the fiflier’s folitary night ; 
And ftill the mitred window, richly w'reathd’, 
A facred calm thro’ the brown foliage breath’d.
The wild deer, ftarting thro’ the filent glade, 
With fearful gaze, their various courfe furvey’d.
High hung in air the hoary goat reclin’d.
His dreaming beard the fport of every wind ; 
And as the coot her jet wing lov’d to lave, 
K ock’d on the bofom of the fleeplefs wave ; 
The eagle rulh’d from Skiddaw’s purple creft, 
A cloud ftill brooding o’er her giant neft.
And now the moon had dimm’d, with dewy ray, 
The few fine flufties of departing day ; 
O’er the wide water’s deep ferene (he hung.
And her broad lights on every mountain flung ; 
When Id !
a fudden blaft the veflel blew.
And to the furge confign’d its little crew.
All, all efcap’d — but ere the lover bore 
His faint and faded Julia to the flrore, 
Her fenfe had fled !
— Exhaufted by the ftorm, 
A fatal trance hung o’er her pallid form ; 
Her clofing eye a trembling luftre fir’d ; 
‘Twas life’s laft fpark — it flutter’d and expir’d .' 
Tlie father ftrew’d his white hairs in the wind.
Call’d on his child — nor linger’d long behind : 
And Floiio liv’d to fee the willow wave, 
With many an evening whifper, o’er their grave.
Yes, Florlo liv’d — and ftill of each pofleft.
The father cheriflt’d, and the maid carefs’d !
For ever would the fond enthufiaft rove, 
With Julia’s fpirit, thro’ the fliadowy grove ; 
Gaze with delight on every feene fire plann’d, 
Kifs every flowret planted by her hand.

When hazy hues and glimmering lights betray’d 
Half-viewlefs forms ; ftill liften’d as the breeze 
Heav’d its deep fobs among the aged trees ; 
And at each paufe her melting accents caught.
In fweet delirium of romantic thought !
Dear was the grot that fliunn’d the blaze of dav, 
She gave its fpars to Ihoot a trembling ray.
The fpring, that bubbled from its Inmolt cell.
Murmur’d of Julia’s virtues as It fell ;

on our right lay another fmall ifland, on whofe rocky margin brulhwood and 
willows hung fantaftically; over thefe the diftant fhores were feen, where the 
mighty cliffs of Falcon and IVallow Crag projedting, (hewed their grotefque and 
tremendous brows, in a lofty line of rocks; beneath whofe feet, a ftrip of cultiva- 
ted lands and woods fhot forth a verdant promontory, which inclined gradually to 
the lake : in the centre of this view, after the eye had palTed an expanfe of the cleared 
and fmootheft water, then brightned by the noontide (un, Cajlle Rocks were feen 
rifing in a cone, and covered with trees; behind which a lofty mountain lifted its 
funburnt brow, trimmed with heath, exceeded only by Skiddaw in eminence, 
which was covered with a blue vapour, and almoft mixing with the clouds, termi- 
nated the profpedl:.
Ullfwater affords a few, but noble and extenfive, fccnes, 
which yield aflonifhment ; whilft Kefwick abounds with a variety of wilder and 
more romantic profpeds.
After pading Bank Parky a rocky and barren promontory, on which a few old 
and crooked trees are fcattered, bent and deformed by (forms, we entered a fine 
bay, where the mountains rife immediately out of the lake ; here perpendicular, 
there falling back in rude and ruinous confufion, as piled heap on heap from the 
convu'fions of chaos; in other parts (helving and hanging over the lake, as if they 
threatened an immediate fall: the whole forming a ftupendous circus.
To 
deferibe this view is difficult, as no language can convey a competent idea of the 
fubjert, where the variety confilfs of various features of the fame wild and 
enormous objedfs ; rocks and mountains forming the parts of this maffivc theatre.
In the front of this romantic feene, a fmall mount prefented itfelf, covered with 
herbage; fmall, from the mighty (fature and gigantic members of the other objeffs 
on the profpetff.
Overlooking the eminence, is a round rock, pulhing his tre- 
mendous brow into the clouds, once crowmed with fome kind of a fortrefs.
Some 
vifitants have conceived this was of Roman work.
Mr. Weft, who attributes every 
thing he can to the monks of Furnefs, conjetftures they had fome ftronghold here 
to protect the mines and falt-works; but we have no evidence by whom or for 
what purpofe any ercdlion was made here; it might be the feat of fome reclufe, 
who, from the example of St. Herbert, had enjoined himfelf a life of feverity in 
this uncommon (ituation.* Upon a ftrift examination of the place, it was not 
poftible 
* “ Not far from lienee arifes a woody hill, called Castle-crag, which is alio detached from the 
feenery around it.
On the fummit of this hill ftood formerly a fortrefs, fuppofed to be of Roman origin ; 
intended to guard this avenue into the country\ After it had been relinquifhed by the Romans, it was 
occupied by the Saxons ; and after their day, it was given, with all the lands about Borrowdale, by one 
of the Lords of Derwentwater to the monks of Furnefs.
By thefe religious it was ftill maintained in 
its military capacity ; which is perhaps a fingular inftance of the kind.
But as the Scots in thofe days 
made frequent in'uptions, even this far into the country ; and as the monks had great polfeffions to de- 
fend in the valley of Borrowdale, where one of the principal magazines was eftablllhed, the holy fathers 
thought it proper to adopt this uncommon meafure.
Befides their tithe corn, they amafled here the 
valuable minerals of the country ; among which fait, produced from a fpring in the valley, was no incon- 
liderable article.” Gilpin’s Tour.

— But to return to our defeription — 
On the fummit of the mount, fweetly contrafted by the grey rocks behind, a few- 
ancient trees, or perhaps one patrician oak, grew with peculiar pidurefque beauty.

On each hand the cliffs and mountains were ftrewed with buflies and fhrubs ; 
dow'n whofe fides fmall ftreams of water trilled, like fo many threads of filver, 
giving a delicate beauty to the grey rocks over which they paffed : in many places 
thefe fteeps are perpendicular, and rent into a thoufand rude columns; in others 
they are of a tamer afped, and compaded in one folid mafs, ftand firm as the 
pillars of the antediluvian world.
Where the hills are feparated, little valleys filled 
with wood, or narrow wdnding dells of grafs ground twift round their bafes, and 
' give a pleafing variegation to the landfcape.
In fome places, clefts in the rocks 
afford a profped into a valley behind ; in others the overhanging cliffs form rude 
arches and apertures, through which diftant mountains are difeovered.
Behind 
are mountains piled on mountains, where the clouds rolled in heavy volumes, 
giving a gloominefs to thofe regions of confufion and barrennefs, which rendered 
the luftre'of the fhining lake, and the ftreams of light which fell upon the rocks,

Mr. Weft points out a fourth ftatlon.
— “ From the top of Caftle-rock or crag, in Borrowdale, there 
5s a moft aftonifhing view of the lake and vale of Kefwick, t© the north.
From the pafs of Borrowdale, 
every bend of the river is diftinftly feen ; the lake itfelf, fpotted 'with ijlands ; the village of Grange at 
the foot of the rock, and the white houfes of Kcfwick, with Crofthwaite church at the lower end of the 
lake.
The area of the caftellura, from eaft to weft, is about feventy yards ; from eaft to north about 
forty yards.
The afeent is by one of the narrow paths cut in the fide of the mountain, for the defeent 
of the date that is quarried on its top.
“ To the fouth, the view is in Borrowdale.
The river is feen winding from the lake upward, through 
the rugged pafs.
“ The moft gigantie mountains that form the outline of this tremendous landfcape, and Inclofe Bor- 
rowdale, are Eagle-crag, Glaramara, Bull-crag, and Serjeant-crag.
On the front of the firft, the bird of 
^ove has his annual neft, which the dalefmen are careful to rob, not without hazard to the aflailant, who 
IS let down from the fummit of this dreadful rock by a rope of twenty fathoms, or more, and is obliged 
to defend himlelf from the attacks of the parent bird in the defeent.
The devaftation made on the fold, 
in the breeding fcafon, by one eyrie, is computed at a lamb a day.
Glaramara is a mountain of perpen- 
dicular naked rock, immenfe in height, and much broken.
Bull-crag and Serjeant-crag are in the centre; 
iheir rugged fdes are concealed ’with hanging ’woods.
“ The road continues good to Rofthwaite.
Here the roads divide ; that on the right leads to the 
wad-mines, and to Ravenglafs ; that on the left to Hawkfhead.
“ Whoever chufes an alpine ride, of a very extraordinary nature, may return through Borrowdale to 
Amblelide, or Hawklhead : — a guide will be neceffary from Rofthwaite over the Stake, a mountain fo 
called, to Langdale chapel Juft where the road begins to afeend the Stake of Borrowdale, are fald to 
be the remains of a bloomery, clofe by the waterfall on the left ; but no tradition relates at what time it 
was laft worked.
The mafles of iron found on Caftle-crag, were probably fmelted here.
Catarafts and 
waterfalls abound on all fides.
In defcendlng the Stake on the Langdale fide, a cataraft accompanies yote 
qn the left.
Langdale-pike, called Pike-a-ftickle, and Steel-pike, is an Inaecefilble pyramidal rock, that 
commands the whole.
Pavey-ark is a hanging rock, fix hundred feet in height, and under It Stickle- 
tarn, a large bafon of water, formed In the bofom of the rock, that pours down In a cataraft at Mill- 
heck ; below this Whiteglll-crag opens to the centre.
Below Langdale chapel, the vale becomes more 
pleafing, the road good to Amblefide or Hawflrihead, by Skelwith-bridge.
“ Mr. Gray was much pleafed with an evening view under Crow-park : — “ In the evening I ’walked 
aione down to the lake, by the fde of Crow-park, afer fun-fet, and fa’w the flernn colouring of the night draw 
m, the laji gleam of fun fine fading away on the hill tops, the deep ferene of the waters, and the long foadows

Mr. Weft preferred the view “ from the fide of Swinfide, where both the lakes are in full view, with 
the whole fore, on the upper lake, and flexures on the lower lake.
* “ From Swinfide, by Foe-park, a fwett evening walk.

the road to Penrith, Skiddam, and Saddleback, — After dinrier malked up Penrith road, itjc." 
Another felcdl llation Mr. Weft points out for a morning view, “ is on Lat-rag.
The nfeent is by 
Monks-hall, leaving Ormthwaite on the left.
“ The view is full into the rocky jaws of Borrowdale.
The lake is feen in its full extent.
The 
Caftle-crag, in Borrowdale, Hands firft, and in the rear Langdale-pike overlooks them all.
“ From the front of Mr. Wren’s houfe, the eye will be delighted with the vale of St. John, betweett 
two ridges of hills ; Loth waite and Naddle-fells, y’lr/?
behind the Cafle-rocks; thefe have the fhew of

Mr. Weft adds — “ Another ftation remains, and which ought to be an evening one, in the vicarage gar-

Mr. Gray took it in his glafs from the horfing-ftone, and fpeaks of it thus : — “ From hence I got

“ If Camden vifited Kefwick, he was fatisfied with the then prefent ftate of the “ little town, which King

That Horfley never vifited 
thofe parts is evident, from his mlftaken account of the road from Plumpton-mall to Kefwick, which he fays 
pafled through Grayfock-park.
— His miftake, and Camden’s filence, gave occafion to a regular furvey of 
the faid road, and finding the military roads from Papcafle, Elenborough, Morefby, Amblefide, and 
Plumpton, all coincide at Kefwick, and for the other reafons already afligned, it appeared evident that 3

We have already introduced fo much defcription, that we forbear to repeat Mr. Young s, as we find 
nothing therein, but materially correfponds with what is before given.
CaosTHWaiTE Pap.ish is in extent from N.
to S.
about 14 miles, and about 8 miles from E.
to W.
including the chapelries in that compafs.
It confifts of ftupendous mountains and narrow valleys and 
dells Some of the mountains are green, and fuinlfti good pafturagc ; others are barrren, rocky, and 
fhaken, from which huge fragments have tumbled into the vales.
_ ^ ^ j , a c 
Soil and Produce.] The lands in general are dry, and the mountains afford abundant pafturagc for 
flicep The inclofed lands lie in the depth of the vales, and bear a very fmall proportion to the commons.
About Kefwick, and towards Skiddaw, the foil is loamy, very deep and fertile, producing excellent oats 
and barley, with a fmall proportion of wheat, clover, tu.nips, and potatoes.
Kefvyick vale is extenfive and 
level.
The inclofed land in general is dr)’-, gravelly, or fluvery, throughout the pariih, and produces 
grain, except wheat and rye, in pretty good perfeftion ; but about two thirds of the land is in grafs.— 
As to the lands lying within the chapelries, thofe in St. John’s and fhornthwaite are the moft fertile, 
and in Borrowdale the moft fterile.

Minerals and Stone.] No coal, lime, or freeftone.
In Borrowdale there is a fine, hard, and

3 In general good, and covered with blue flate.
—   But the old building have been con- 
ilrufted without lime, and are plaftered on the outfides ; their walls are thick, and apartments badly con- 
trived.
The out door is generally fo ftrong and awkward, that it feems intended for defence, more than 
convenience.
Fuel.] About Kefwick moftly coals ; In the more dlftant parts peats.
Fences.] Of hard rough ftone, of which material there is great plenty everywhere at hand.
Wood.] Not much of ancient growth, many plantations, and much bruflrwood on the lleirts of the 
mountains.
Game.] Groufe, partridge, hares.
All forts of game in this country have decreafed lately: the 
fhepherds, and others, who are deprived by the game-laws of partaking In a fmall degree of the native 
dainties of their mountains and vales, deftroy the eggs and nefts, which they perform with fafety and 
cafe.
It Is a general praftice in the northern counties, and the decreafe of game is not the effedl of 
adverfe feafons.
At a public meeting of qualified gentlemen in an adjoining county, a prefent was re- 
ceived of 2000 partridge eggs, carefully packed !
Medicinal Springs.] On the weft fide, and near the head of Derwent, are two falt-fprings, thought 
to proceed from the lead-mines ; much reforted to by the country people Have not heard that they 
have been analyzed.
A copper-mine was difeovered, but Is not wrought at prefent.
Rivers.] Derw'ent and Greeta, and many brooks of clear water.
Roads.] In general remarkably good ; that leading to Ravenglafs and Bootle, an alpine pafs, before 
defcribed.
Fish.] In the lakes and rivers are trout, bafs, eels, and other fmall kinds.
School.] The matter, befides his ftipend, receives from his fcholars a fee called the cockpenny.
At 
Shrovetide cockfights are held at the fchool, where each fcholar exhibits his cock, and makes the matter 
a piefent of money for the toleration.
It ftiould feem, from this cuftom, that the Idea of the inftitutor, 
and of the parents, was, that learning effeminated and foftened the human mind too much ; and therefore 
thofe cruel fports were permitted, to harden their feelings, and encourage a martial fpirit and ferocity of 
temper.
Sheep and Cattle.] On an average, is calculated that 30,000 fticep are kept in this parlffi They

Housman’s Notes.
f The beauties of the Cumberland lakes, will be beft eftimated by a comparifon with other celebrated 
feenes of the like nature.
Mr. Gray, in his letter to Mr. Weft from Genoa, dated 21ft Nov. 1739, fays — “ Only figure to 
yourfelf a vaft femicircular bafon, full of fine blue fea, and veffels of all forts and fizes, fomc failing out, 
fomc coming In, and others at anchor : and all around It palaces and churches peeping over one another’s 
heads, gardens and marble terraces full of orange and cyprefs trees, fountains, and trelh’s works, covered 
with vines, which altogether compofe the grandeft of theatres.” 
Other travellers deferibe the beauty of this lake at the time of the vintage, and mention, with particu- 
lar pleafure, the fong ufed by the reapers, which is fung In refponfe by thofe on each fide of the lake,

The lake of Killarney, or Loch Lene, in Ireland, is much celebrated, and the following extraSs are 
taken from the different authors who have defcrlbed it.
— The firft, publifhed in the Gentleman’s Mag.
there faid to be a letter to the Rev. Dr.
Samuel Madden : the other from Derrick’s Letters, and Mr.
Smith’s account of the county of Kerry.
“ I confefs* * * § I have been lately entertained by one of the curiofities (of this country) to which I was 
an intire ftranger before 1 went into the fouthern part of this kingdom, which has been long but falfely 
reprefented as almoft Inacceffible.
“ 1 was fhewn a lake near the feat, which bears the title of Kllmere, and town of Killarney, called 
Lene, which I was informed had feveral extraordinary qualities attending it : this railed my curlofity to 
take a nearer view of it.
“ Itf is formed almoft perfeftly oval, being about eight miles in length, and four in breadth, even as 
if it had been hollowed and cut out by the hand of art : the colour of its water is not fo clear as that of 
the fea ; yet do they pretend, however incredible, to fee a carbuncle at the bottom, which 60 fathoms of 
line cannot reach.
“ The lake does not feem, by tafte or fmell, to be impregnated with any metalline matter, although 
there are two excellent chalybeate fptings in the neighbourhood of it, as well as mines in its iflands.
“ $It is but of a moderate extent ; yet the winds have a great effeft upon it, throwing it into violent 
commotions.
For whilft they ftruggle between the chafms of the mountains which hang over the lake, 
Mangerton, Ture, Tomifh, and Glena, the moft ftupendous in this kingdom, the agitated fluid is railed 
and deprefled into hills and valleys of water : then it is extremely perilous for navigation.
1| But when the 
winds fettle, and the lake recovers a fmooth furface, nothing is more deleftable than to be upon it in 
veflels moved by oars, or falls filled with a gentle gale : to angle upon its furface for trout or falmon, or 
to (hoot the various kinds of water-fowl, or to hunt the otter, or to vlfit the iflands adorned with great vari- 
ety of beauties ; and to partake of a chearful repaft, where exercife gives appetite, and the place gives 
food.
The water affords fifh and fowl, the mountains venlfon, and the trees their fruits, which are of 
more kinds than the wilding apple and plumb.
There grow alfo in plenty the oak, fervice, and yew, 
with many other fpecies of trees of common notice in the neighbouring forefts and other places.
But

Around us was fpread a grove of tall young oaks, afli, and birch trees, which gave 
an agreeable coolnefs and fliade ; above the trees, with uplifted looks, to the right 
we viewed a mountain of rock, called Shepherd’s Crag, a rude circular mafs, 
Shelving from the bafe to the fummit in a fpiral form ; on every plane of which, 
and 
pKment to the orange tree, as Jhe pays, difcovers Jlill Jhe owe/;” for at one and all times the Arbutus 
has ripe and green fruit upon it, with blolToms promifing a fucceflive growth.
The fruit is a pleafing 
objeft to the eye, being of a fcarlet colour, In form exadtly like that of a field ftrawberry, and in fize 
that of the bell garden kind ; the leaf is extremely like the bay in fiiape and coloui , and the bloffoms 
grow in beautiful clullers of fmall white bells ; — and all thefe are perennial.
Imagine a foreft of trees 
upon a rifing ground, plentifully intermixed with this kind, whofe fruit and flowers growing in great 
abundance, fliall fo variegate the verdure with fcarlet and white, that wanton conceit cannot fuggeft any 
thing more pleafing to human fight, except a great variety of fuch, which this lake affords in forty iflands, 
and upon at leaft the fourth part of the afeent of the mountains ; the verge of whofe bafes is waflied by 
the v/ater of the lake, and their fides here and there with cafeades, whofe fall is almoft perpendicular — 
All that beautiful feenery may be feen, when the reft of nature, during a winter’s fleep, has a dreary 
afpeft.
*The iflands differ in their fize and fhape ; one is fingnlar, being very fmall, and appearing at 
a diftance like a horfef In the pofture of drinking ;|| another alfo, fora fancied reprefentatlon, bears the 
name of Odonahoo's pr}fon,% as a third does that of his garden : the edges of all thefe are worn away by 
the frequent collifion of the water againfl.

But what gives ftill a much greater pleafure to the fpefta- 
tor, are the flupendous rocks of marble, of which mofl of the iflands confiil, feeding In gaping clefts a 
variegated foreft ; In the compafs of 30 paces of one of which I counted 20 fpecies of trees, yet with- 
out any appearance of earth, either for ftability or nourlfhment.
Every' ifland is crowned with its enli- 
vened fertility, except three, though nature feems to have refufed every fupply of vegetation ; fome of 
them being rocks at fuch an height above the lake as to be the habitation of eagles, and to leprefent 
ancient caftles from which time has worn the cement, and fcarce one maffy ftone is feen contiguous to 
another, as if each flab of marble hung without touching, in rude architefture, and almoft without foun- 
dations.
For the waters have worn pafiages in fome of them, even for boats, and have left only flender 
pillars to fupport immenfe weights, fo that if the verdant covering does not dread its hidden ruin, the 
fpeftator does.
Yet fome iflands are of a very different kind, which, containing larger areas of furface, 
afford convenient harbours for landing, and are not only acceflible, but ycild beautiful herbage for the 
kine whofe fleflr, after fome w'ceks delicious repaft therein, is made lufclous food for man ; the fat 
becoming marrow, and too rich for the chandlers’ ufe s and what is ftill more extraordinary, mines of 
lead and copper are found here, though enemies to fertility in all other places.
“ In one of thefe Iflands is an ancient fabric of ftrength, and good defence in time of war ; In another 
there are large remains of a fplendid manfion of the religious.
And furely each w'as well defigned for its 
purpofe ; for whither could men better flee for fafety or retirement, from the fell rage of war, or the 
tumultuous world, to ftiong fecurity, and the quiet exercife of pious orifons to the Deity.
“ Here is Indeed fecurity for man, but not for the hunted flag, who, frighted from his free range of

“ To deferibe every objeA that Is vllible In the feenery of this lake, which hitherto is only known by 
the ordinary maps, in that order which a good judgment, joined to a rich fancy, with an executive 
hand, is capable of doing, would be to give mankind perhaps the mofl beautiful landfcape that the known 
world can afford ; which is not faid In a vain manner, to raife an opinion of fuperior excellence concern- 
ing this profpeft, or to depreciate others.
Nations not only fpeak with jealoufy of their neighbouring 
climates and produAIons, but even the inhabitants of provinces of the fame kingdom, and counties of 
the fame province.

every beholder.
The iflands clothed with this tree, intermixed with others, ^ive even winter the lo\ely 
appearance of fpring ; for then it is in Its higheft bloom, which, rarely growing in other places, Is tlio 
more likely to be admired by ftrangers in this.
It ufed to flourifh in other parts of the county, but ilic 
making of charcoal for iton-foundaries has been the occafion almoft of its deftruftion.
And even hcie it 
fuffered greatly by an accidental fire, w'hich laid wafte a great part of a foreft.
Its growing In rocks of 
marble with W'hIch the lake abounds, where no earth appears, and high above the furfacc of the water, 
in what fhould rather be called caftles than iflands, gives both furprife and pleafure.
“ Some of thefe Iflands, rich In herbage, and adorned with this beautiful tree, deferve the appellation of 
gardens; for they are not wdthout (ome fruits of the efculent kind.
The pears of the Sorbus (Service) are 
found here ; and the apple under which name the fruit of the Arbutus alfo is eaten.
^ A gentleman of 
very good eftimation in the peninfula of Mucrus, has Inclofed many rocks of marble In his garden, adorned, 
with thefe trees and fruits, and allowdng nature to be bis chief gardener, may vie with the mofl eminent, 
for horticulture.
When his vines fhall come to perfeftion, which he has planted near Hoping marble 
rocks, and are almoft the only adventitious plants of the place, he will be able to give a delicious racy 
fruit to his guefts, as he now is to entertain them at board with becoming hofpitallty of liquor and 
venifon.
“ The bunting of the flag here has more than ordinary mufic attending that fport ; for the echoes re-, 
verberate the founds in a manner not eafily deferibed nor believed by any but thofe that hear them ; the 
w’hole duration of the returns of one found being only one minute, and yet the repercuffions innumerable,, 
and the variety Inconceivable.
Sometimes a cannon, which the honourable proprietor of the lake has, 
placed here for that purpofe.
Is fired, and the loudnefs of the echo being Increafed in proportion, the firfb 
fenfation is that of the moft tremendous thunder ; and the pro^refs and effeft refemble thofe excited by 
a fimilar caufe on mount Carpathus, as deferibed by Frxlichius, m Varenius’ Geography.
“ Carpathns,’” 
fays this author, “ is the chief of thofe mountains In Hungary, which feparate the Hungarians from the 
Ruffians, Polandevs, Moravians, Silefians, and thofe in the part of Aviftiia beyond the Danube.
They- 
are almoft impaflable, and nobody goes near them, but thofe that are curious admirers of nature.
I find 
that the higheft top of mount Cajpathus rifes a German mile from its loweft root up to the higelt 
regions of the air, to which the winds never reach.
— I fired a piftol on the top, which at firft made no 
greater noife than if I had broken a flick, but after a little time, there was a murmuring for a good while, 
which filled the valleys and woods below.
Coming down through the fnow, I fired again, which made a 
dreadful found, as If great guns had been fired, and I was afraid the whole mountain would come down 
upon me.
The found lafled for half a quarter of an ho\ir, till it had reached the moft fecret caverns,, 
where the found being enlarged, refledfed back every way ; which caverns being above, there was at firft 
little rebounding; but when the found reached thofe below, it rebounded violently.” The echoes of 
Lough Lene are the fame with thofe of Carpathus, with this difference, that the founds which occafion 
them being thofe of voi.ces or inftruments below, in, the denfe atmofphere, the firft repercuffions are ftrong 
and terrifying, and by growing fainter, feem at lad to die : but foon revive ; yet it were to be wiflied 
the experiment was tried above, in the heights of the mountains, and then probably the faint founds 
wculd return firft, and the lou d and dreadful repercuffions laft.
“ From the point under Glena to the upper lake, that is five miles diftance, every cavern rebounds 
with echoes : in the centre, between Glena and Turk, thefe two mountains are feen In a beautiful thea- 
trical form, approaching fo clofe, at fome diftance from the point of view, as to allow only a paffage for 
a river which communicates with the two lakes.
The courfe of this river admits of a great deal of vari- 
ety, being in fome places deep and fmooth, in others rough and fliallow, but pleafing in all.

rocks, the river points its whole ilream, forming a grand cafcade, faid to be two 
hundred feet in height : as the channel is rugged, the water makes a fheet of toam, 
thundering 
hang directly over the river, which Is almoft too narrow for oars.
The fttipendous rock, called the Eagle's 
Nell, Is an ufual reding place, where the amufing echo entertains all travellers.
The Arbutus all along 
fmiles upon the fpedlators, whild fome of the rocks on which it grows feem to threaten ruin.
To thefe the 
navigators have given whimfical names, as the man of war to one which looks like a hull at Chatham, except 
that a branching yew at top gives fome idea of rigging.
Having pafled thefe watry defiles, yon enter 
into a larger area of lake, called the upper, being about looo acres, as the lower is twice that quantity.
— 
In this compafs are twenty iflands, where the ofprey and eagle feem to be proprietors ; as herds of deer 
do in the mountains which totally furround it.
The principal amufements here, are the echoes, cafeades, 
and iflands, fome one of which may be chofen for a place of red and refrefliment, as well as a point of view.
The manner of returning is either by boat through the fame fccnes, or by horfe through another trail of 
mountains, which for variety is the mod eligible, on a road equal in goodnefs to that of the bed in the 
kingdom, made by the gentlemen of the country, at the folicitation of the noble proprietor.
This work, 
was deemed impoffible for many years, and yet was at lad executed at a fmall expence.” 
The following extrails of Dr. Smith’s Hidory of the County of Kerry, Derrick’s Letters, and Mr.
Pennant’s account of Loch Lomond, will complete this comparative reference.
“ Dr. Smith’s defeription is to the following effeCl : — “ One of the bed profpeils which it affords, is 
on a rifing ground, near the ruined cathedral of Oghadoe : not but there are many other fine views of it 
from every other fide, but few of them take In fo many particulars as may be obferved from that dation.
For from hence is to be feen one of the mod delicious landfcapes in Ireland ; and perhaps few countries in 
Europe afford better.
But this is fuch a mader-piece, that even Pouffin, Salvator Rofa, or the mod: 
eminent painter in that way, might here furnifli himfelf with fufficient matter, not only to form one, but 
fevcral entertaining profpefts.
I'rom this eminence, a furvey may be taken of the greated part of this 
beautiful lake ; and likewlfe of that dupendous amphitheatre of mountains which are ranged along the op- 
pofite diore.
Towards the fouth-ead, dands the mountain called Mangerton, whofe feet the lake w'alhes, and 
whofe fummit is generally lod in the clouds, it being, from the above recited experiment, judly edeemed 
one of the highed mountains in Ireland.
More towards the centre of the lake, is a high mole, called 
Turk^ whofe Cdes, down to the verge of the water, are beautifully clothed with groves of various kinds of 
trees.
One part of this hill dopes away like a promontory terminating in the lake, forming one fide of 
a canal, which is a paffage Into the upper lake ; as doth the point of another mountain, called Glenr.a, the 
other fide of this dreight, w'hich is adorned alfo with fored trees.
As a fine contrad to this verdure, at 
the back of tliefe mountains dand others, fliaped into pyramids, being only naked rocks of a vad height.
The grandeur and magnificence of thefe mountains, not only entertain and furprife the fpedlator, but he 
mud be alfo agreeably amufed in contemplating the Infinite variety of beautiful colouring they afford.
For 
In one part may be feen the gayell verdure, blended with fcarlet fruit and fnowy bloffoms, well known 
properties of the Arbutus ; and in other places the mod elegant variety of brown and yellow tints, caufed 
by other kinds of trees and ftirubs, appears : all thefe are Intermixed w'ith rock-work ; and, to foften the 
whole, a deep, fmooth, and noble bafon of water extends iifelf beneath this feenery.
But, to give the 
reader an adequate idea of this place, would require the pencil of fome excellent painter, rather than the 
pen of any profe writer.
To the wed of Glenna dands the lofty pike, called Tomijh^ variegated half way 
to its top with a waving fored ; and down whofe fides, efpecially after rains, run very confiderable cata- 
racts into the great lake.
There are many other hills dill running more wed, as far as the eye can trace 
for many miles : the neared and mod furprifing for their loftincfs, are the rocks, whofe tops refemble fo 
many pinacles, or rather fpires, lod in the clouds.
The water is light and pure ; and, notwithdanding 
the great variety of minerals which furround this lake, it doth not feem to be impregnated with any of 
them.
The ancient verfes of Nenlus, who wrote in the ninth century, and which Mr. O’Flahertv, in his 
Og ygla, alfo cites, make mention of them : —

“ As one fide of this lake confifts of the above mentioned range of formidable hills, fo the oppofite fide 
is adorned with a level and beautiful country, with the town of Killarney, and the habitations and im- 
provements of feveral gentlemen, at different diftances.
But before I defcribe thefe, it will be neceflary 
to mention fomewhat of the feveral iflands which He beautifully fcattered over the lake; as alfo of the 
furprifing echoes it affords.
The moft noted of thefe iflands is that of Rofs, which is rather a peninfula, 
being only fcparated by a fmall cut through a morafs from the main land, over which is abridge.
On it 
Hands an ancient caflle, formerly the feat of O’Donhega Rofs, which hath a new barrack adjoining to 
it.
This place hath been for fome years paft a military garrifon, having a governor appointed for it, 
upon the eftablifliment.
Before the caflle are a few old difmounted iron guns, which give it fomcthing 
of the air of a fortification.
The caflle had been flanked with round turrets, which, together with its 
fituation, rendered it a place of fome flrength.
The greater part of this ifland is covered with wood; 
and it is no difagreeable fpot for fuch gentlemen of the army, quartered here, who are fond of fifhing, 
hunting, or fowling.
The ifland of Innlsfallen Is next to Rofs in quantity of land; in it are the ruins 
<s)f a very ancient religious houfe, founded by St. Finian, furnamed the Leffer, who flourifhed towards 
the middle of the fixth century.
The remains of this abbey are very extenfive, although the walls In 
many places ate levelled to the ground, its fituation was extremely romantic and retired.
Upon the dif- 
folutlon of religious houfes, the poffeffions of this abbey were granted to Captain Robert Collam.
This 
Ifland contains about twelve acres, and hath feveral very pleafant coves, agreeably wooded, for landing 
upon It. It yields fo great a p.
ofufion of fweet herbage, that the kine which are put upon It to fatten, 
thrive fo prodigioufly, that their fat becomes a kind of rich marrow In a very fhort time.
On the eafl 
fide of the ifland, the walls of an old chapel have been lately repaired, by fome gentlemen who frequently 
ufe It as a banquetting houfe.
There are, befides timber trees, the remains of feveral fruit trees, as plumbs, 
pears, &c.
which have outlived the defolatloii that hath felzed on the cells of thofe reclufes who firft 
planted them.
Many of thefe trees had fruit ripe upon them when I was In the ifland: the plumbs in 
particular, being of a large red kind, were very fine.
Here are alfo the fruit of the forbus or feivice tree, 
likewlfe the Arbutus, and other flirubs, which were all planted by the monks though the neighbouring 
inhabitants will have them to be the fpontaneous produtllon of the foil.
In fhort, it Is a beautiful roman- 
tic wildernefs, decorated at prefent with thefe plantations and its venerable ruins, which are no fmall 
addition to the beauties of Lough Lene.
Rabbit Ifland flands to the well of Innisfallen, and Is chiefly 
remarkable for Its quarries of good Hmeflone, which the neighbouring inhabitants dig and burn In order 
to manure their ground.
An infinite number of iflands of a fmaller fize fpangle and adorn this lake, moft 
of which are covered with Arbutus, and feveral other beautiful fhrubs.
One of them, from a fancied re- 
prefentatlon, refembles at fome diflance the figure of a horfe in a drinking pofture.
Another is called 
O’Donaghoe^prlfon, and a third his garden.
Moft of them are of marble, clothed with evergreen 
Ihrubs, growing out of the crevices of the rocks.
Some of the iflands In the upper lake are of fuch 
a ftupendous height, that they refemble at a diflance fo many lofty towers Handing in the water, and being 
many of them crowned with wreaths of Arbutus, reprefent the ruins of ftately palaces.
Their edges are 
fo much worn away by the dafhing of the water againft their fides, and by frequent rains wafhing away 
the earth, and time has fo disjoined many of the marble rocks, that feveral of them hang in a moft fur- 
prifing and tottering manner ; and reprefent a rude kind of confufed architefture, almoft without foun- 
dations.
In others of them, the waters have worn paflages fufficiently large for boats to go through 
thefe tottering arches, which in fome places (though they are of immenfe weight) are only upheld by 
very {lender pillars.
“ Upwards of forty Iflands In this lake are covered with an Intermixture of Arbutus and other fhrubs ; 
befides, at leaft, a fourth part of the afeents of the mountains, the verges of whofe bafes, like that of 
Mangerton, and others above mentioned, are wafhed by the waters of this lake.
“ Thus having mentioned what was remarkable of the mountains which furround It, and of the lake 
itfelf, and its Iflands, I fhall beg leave to apply the following lines of the poet, whofe defeription of the 
Jake Fergus is no ill pifture of Loch Lene : —

The fpray from this waterfall, in the evening fun, fhews the 
limb of a rainbow.

when he wrote his Seafons : —

“ The principal inhabitants of thefe lofty mountains, except a few woodmen kept In the foreft by the 
lord of the foil, are great herds of red deer ; the chace of which affords a much higher gratification to the 
fportfman than in moft other places.
When a ftag is hunted near this lake, nothing is more agreeably fur« 
prifing than the repeated echoes ; it being fcarce poflible to diftingulih the real clangour of the French-horn, 
or the true cry of the dogs, from the numberlefs reverberations of them among the rocks and mountains.
“ Inceptus clamor fruftratur hiantes.” Virg.
“ And we may alfo juftly apply to the unharbouring of the deer, what the fame poet more metaphorically 
fings of Csefar !
— 
“ Ipfi Ixtitia voces, ad fidera jaftant

“ To which may not Improperly be added the following lines of a modern poet » 
“ Hark !
the loud peal begins the clam’rous joy.
The gallant chiding loads the trembling air.
Ye naiads fair, v'ho o’er thefe floods prefide, 
Ralfe up your dripping wings above the wave, 
And hear our melody.

“ The echoes which are caufed by this fport reverberate the found in a manner not to be defcribed, 
nor believed by any but thofe who have heard them ; the whole duration of a Angle found being near a 
minute : and yet the repercuflions are innumerable, and the variety Inconceivable.
But the moft afto- 
nifhing founds, emulating thunder, are thofe made by the difeharge of cannon, placed In a proper lltua- 
tlon, upon the points of fome particular Iflands, which may beft anfwer to the concave fides of the moun-

Having palTed this long and narrow ftraight, the upper lake is difcovered, which is furrounded on 
all fides with mountains of an amazing height, beautified alfo with woods ; for here, according to Milton, 
“ Over head up grow 
Infuperable height of loftieft (liade.

“ This upper lake is an oblong fquare, extending north and fouth, but is not a third of the area of 
the lower lake.
'I'he rocks and iflands are here inhabited by eagles, ofpreys, hawks, and other birds of 
prey ; as are the forefts on the adjacent mountains with red deer.
“ In certain feafons, very confiderable waterfalls and cafcades tumble from the mountains into this • 
upper lake, which, with the echoes and delightful fcenery of the profpeft, are alfo the chief entertainment 
of this place, as in the lower lake.” 
The Letters from which the following extracts are taken bear the general name of Derrick’s Letters, 
but feveral of them were written by Mr. Ockcuden, and publKhed by Derrick.
Speaking of the ifland of Innisfallen — “ There are various eminences in different parts of this moft 
truly fortunate ifle, commanding feveral beautiful views over different parts of the lake.
To the north- 
weft there is one fiirveying an cxpanfe of water, four miles In length, and three in breadth, bounded on 
the right hand by the cultivated hills of Aghadoe, and on the left by (baggy mountains : there is another 
to the fouth-weft, which, extending two miles acrofs the lake, terminates in the bowery (hculder of mount 
Glena ; but the fineft lies fouth-eaft, where the eye is loft In a labyrinth of water, winding round a mul- 
titude of iflands, rifing one beyond another ; fome rocky and bare, and fome tufted with trees, which, 
thick on every fide, hang waving over the lake.
“ From Innisfallen, we (leered another courfe, and, after two miles of very pleafing navigation, with 
the open part of the lake on our right hand, and the Iflands clufteiing on our left, we approached thofe 
alpine hills which hang upon the fouthern edge of the water ; and were quite tranfported with a mar- 
vellous fcene of pure nature, which there arofe before us, more exquifite than any I had ever feen, either 
in France, Italy, or England : It is formed by the fide of mount Glena, which bends a little hollowing, 
very rocley, extremely fteep, and is covered quite up with great variety of trees, as oak, beech, and 
mountain afli, moll beautifully blended with holly, yew, and arbutus, rooted in the rock a thoufand feet 
above the furface of the vvater.
We reded upon our oars within the bowery bofom of this fublime 
theatre, enraptured with the beauties we beheld.” 
After paffing into the upper lake — " Here we again refted upon our oars, &c.
when fuddenly, to our 
inexpreffible amazement, we were furprifed with mufic fweeter than any I had every heard before, which 
feemed to rife from the rock at which we gazed ; and, breaking upon us in (hort melodious drains, filled 
the very foul with tranfport.
Angels from the (ley, or faries from the mountain, or O’Donoghoe from 
the river, was what we every moment expedled to appear before us ; but, after a quarter of an hour’s 
fixed attention, all our raptures were difperfed by a clap of thunder moft aftonifhingly loud, which, burfting 
/rom the fame direftioa whence the mufic had feemed to flow, rent the mountain with its roar, and filled

But 
us with the apprehenfion of being inflantly burled In a chaos of hill, wood, and water ; but the horror 
was as fuddenly diflipated by the return ot the fame foothing drains, which had before entranced us.
The 
fecond mufic, which immediately fucceeded the thunder, feemed more foft and lulling than the fitft.
But 
our Elyfium was very ihort, for being foon loft in another clap, ftill louder than that which had preceded 
and which again burft fuddenly upon us ; again awaking us to terror ; when lo !
a third return of mufic^ 
fupeilatively fweet indeed, reftored our fenfes, and re-entranced our hearts.
“ The fecond piece of water, much fmaller than the firft, is thick fpread with very odd figured Iflands, 
and inclofed quite round with tall mountains, rifing for the moft part from the edge of the w'ater.
It 
appears of an oblong fquare, and at fome little diftance, above the upper end, the whole river that feeds 
it is formed by nature into a large cafeade, which makes a moft glorious appearance, tumbling down the 
bofom of the mountain, and glittering between the trees, with which it is on both, fidts- very richly em- 
broidered.
It falls mere than two hundred feet perpendicularly, flowering in its defeent, and divided 
into two flieets, until, ftriking againft fome craggy rocks which project from the mountain’s fide, it thea 
forms three ftieets ; and roars and foams and rufties to the bottom.
“ The vaft height of the defeent, the variety of ftreams, and the richnefs of (hade on both fides, have 
made that great traveller.
Dr. Pococke, Bifliop of Oflbry, deem it the moft beautiful cataradl he ever faw

Mr. Pennant fpeaks thus of T ocli Lomond, In Scotland — “ Loch Lomond,, the moft beautiful of

the water’s edge ; their fummits lofiy, naked, and craggy.
On- the eaft fide, the mountains are equally 
high, but their tops form a more even ridge parallel to the bke, except where Ben Lomond, like Saul 
amidft his companions, overfteps the reft.
The upper parts are black and barren the lower had great 
marks of fertility, or at leaft of Indiiftry, for the yellow corn was finely contrafted with the verdure of 
the groves intermixed with it.
The eaftern bouedarj' is part of the Grampian hills.
Two great head- 
lands, covered with trees feparate the firft feene from one totally different ; the laft is called the point of 
Firkin.
On palling this cape, an expanfe of water butfts at once on your eye, varied with all the fofter 
beauties of nature.
Immediately beneath, is a flat covered with wmod and corn ; beyond the headlands 
ftretch far into the water, and confift of gentle rifings ; many have their furfaces covered with wood, 
others adorned with trees, loofly fcattered either over a fine verdure, or the purple bloom of the heath.
Numbers of iflands are dilperfed over the lake, of the fame elevated form as the little capes, and wooded 
in the fame manner ; others juft peep above the furface, and are tufted with trees ; and numbers are fo 
difpofed as to form magnificent vlftoes between.
Oppefite Lufs, at a fmall diftance from ftiore, is a 
mountainous Ifle, almoft covered with wood ; is near half a mile long, and has a moft fine effeft, I could 
not count the number of iftands, but was told there are twenty-eight !
the largeft two miles long, and 
flocked with deer.
The length of this charming lake Is twenty-four Scotch miles ; its greateft breadth 
right : its depth an hundred and twenty fathoms.
The country from Lufs to the fouthern extremity of 
the lake continually Improves; the mountains fink gradually into fmall hills ; the land is highly cultiva- 
ted, well planted, and well Inhabited.

Inch Calloch, or the Ifle of Nuns, has on It the remains of a church ;

Inch Murrin, or the Ifle of St.

On returning from this grand fpeilacle, the greatefl: beauties of this lake are 
thrown into one profped: : the ground whereon we ftood was rugged and rocky, 
lhadowed with trees; looking over a rich bofom of wood, below us lay the Lodore 
meadows, where groups of cattle were difperfed ; and, by the £hore, fome carpen- 
ters were repairing their boats, — a circumftance which enlivened the Icene.
The 
fhining lake lay in one fmooth plane, refledling the azure fky, chequered w'ith 
clouds : over which the Vicar’s Ifland, yellow with corn, and the wooded iflands, 
were fortunately arranged ; the mountains, whofe feet were trimmed with wood, 
lay in long perfpecTive to the left.
Catslehead, with its embowered cone, and 
Lord’s Ifland, arifing from the oppoiite fliore, intervened between us and the vale 
of Kefwick, coloured with happy tinctures of fummer; over which the awful 
Skiddaw, with his inferior race of mountains, frowned in azure majefty, and doled 
the feene.
Here were all thofe beauties of colouring, which Dr. Brown deferibed.
In this profped one finds all the order and beauty of colouring mentioned by 
Mafon ; — 
" Vivid green, 
** Warm brown, and black opaque, the foreground bears, 
Confpicuous ; — fober olive coldly marks 
feveral little low and naked ifles ferve to diverfify the feene.
From this fpot the boundaries of the water 
are magnificent and diftincl !
the wooded fide of the weftern, and the foaring head of Ben JLomond on 
the eaftern, form a view that is almoll unequalled.
The height of Ben Lomond, from the furface of 
the lake, is 3240 feet.” 
* Mr. Gilpin gives the following remarks — “ By this time we had approached the head of the lake ; 
and could now diftingulfli the full found of the fall of Lodore, which had before reached our ears, as the 
wind fuffered, indiftinflly, in broken notes.
“ This waterfall is a noble objedl, both In Itfelf, and as an ornament of the lake.
It appears more as an 
objeft connefted with the lake, as we approached by water.
By land, we fee it over a promontory of 
low ground, which in fome degree hides its grandeur.
At the diftance of a rnile, it begins to appear 
with dignity.
But of vvhatever advantage the fall of Lodore may be as a piece of diftant feenery.
Its 
tlfedl is very noble, when examined on the fpot.
Asa fingle objedf, it wants no accompanyments of 
ofFskip ; which would rather injure than aflill it.
The ftream falls through a chafm, between two 
towering perpendicular rocks.
The Intermediate parts, broken into large fragments, form the rough 
bed of the cafeade.
Some of thefe fragments, ftretchlng out In flielves, hold a depth of foil fufficient for 
large trees Among thefe broken rocks the ftream finds its way, through a fall of at leaft an hundred 
feet ; and, in heavy rains, the water Is every way fuited to the grandeur of the feene.
Rocks and water 
in oppofition, can hardly produce a more animated ftrife.
The ground at the bottom alfo Is very much 
broken, and overgrown with trees and thickets ; amongft which the water is fwallowed up into an abyfs; 
and at length finds It way through deep channels Into the lake.
We difmounted, and got as near as we 
could ; but were not able to approach fo near, as to look into the woody chafm which receives the fall.”

Claude, in his happieft hour, never ftruck out a finer landfcape it has every 
requifite which the pencil can demand, and is perhaps the only view in England 
which can vie w'ith the fublime fcenes from which that painter formed his tafte.
VVe now returned to our boat, and failing within fome little diftance of the 
fhorc, had a view of the waterfall; whilft the beauties of the lake, to the 
fouth-eaft, lay in pleafing perfpeeftive: we looked over a Imall parr of the bafon, 
from w'hence, on the left, a ftupendous cliff arofe, on whofe fleirts, and in the 
rents and fhelves of its rude fides, were feen ffirubs and trees climbing to the very 
fummit : before us lay the wood from which we had lately paffed, under whofe 
fhade Lodore-houfe and inclofures were feen fireiching to the water’s brink; above 
thefe the lofty precipice, the waterfall, and Shepherd’s Crag, were beautifully dif- 
played; whilft all beyond the mountains formed a crefeent ; rock behind rock, 
and mountain behind mountain, in a moft awful, arrangement ; bringing to our 
minds thofe aftonifhing fcenes which cfearadlerize.

We piaffed from hence, in our feturn'to KerwTck, by the coaft, where we were 
fliew n a cliff, called Eve's-Crag, from its bearing a rude limilitude to a female 
coloflian ftatue.
We next paffed JVallow-Crag, in which a large opening appears, 
bearing the name of Lady's Rake, from a traditional tale of Lady Derwentwater’s 
making an efcape, by climbing thefe horrid and ftupendous heights, with fome 
jewels and valuable trinkets, when her unhappy lord was taken by the officers of 
the crown.
We now reached Lord’s Island, containing fome few acres, covered with 
wood ; where appear the ground-work and ruins of fome buildings, which the 
people told us w'ere the remains of a feat-houfe of the Derwentwater family ; they 
informed us this was originally a peninfula, but when it became the place of that 
family’s refidence, it was cut through, and the place was acceffible only by a draw- 
bridge.
This was a beautiful retirement.
Our next purfuit was to take a walk a few miles on the turnpike road towards 
Penrith, to gain a fight of the vale, and view the Druids’ Circle.
This druidical monument is placed on the fummit of a hill, where the ground is 
almoft level, about two miles from Kefwick, on the fouth fide of the turnpike 
road.
We will take Mr. Gray’s defeription of his progrefs from Penrith, previous

The valley of St. John appeared in fight, and 
the fummits of Catchidecam, (called by Camden Cafticand) and Helvellyn, faid 
« to be as high as Skiddaw, and to rife from a much greater bafe.” This circle 
is compofed of ftones of various forms, natural and unhewn, as colleded from the 
furface of the earth; but from what lands it is impoffible to conjedure, nioft of 
them being of a fpecies of granite.
The ftones, as Mr. Gray obferves, are hfty in 
number, fet in a form not exadly circular, the diameter being thirty paces from 
caff to weff, and thirty-two from north to fouth ; at the eaftern fide a fmall inclo-

cumference.
The fingularity noticed in this monument, is the recefs on the 
caftern fide.
— Mr. Pennant has faid on this matter — But what diftinguifhes this 
from all other druidical remains of this nature, is a rectangular recefs on the 
“ eaft fide of the area, formed of great Hones like thofe of the oval.
Thefe Hruc- 
tures have been conlidered in general to have been temples or places of 
“ worHiip : — the recefs here mentioned fecm.s to have been allotted for the druids^ 
“ the prieHs of the place, a fort of holy of holies where they met, feparated from the 
" vulgar, to perform their rites, their divinations, or to fit in council to determine 
" on controverfies, to compromife all diflcrences about limits of land, or about 
“ inheritances, or for the trial of greater criminals : the druids pofTefTing both the 
“ office of prieH and judge.
The caufc that this recefs was placed on the eaH 
“ Hde, feems to arife from the refpedf paid by the ancient natives of this iHe to 
“that beneficent luminary, the not originally an idolatrous refpedl, but 
“ merely as a fymbol of the glorious all-feeing Being, its great Creator.” 
Mr. Gough’s remarks are — “ In the neighbourhood of this place, on the right 
“ hand of the road from Kefwick to Penrith, is a colleSiion of Hones, of unequal 
“ fize and Hiapc, about thirty-nine yards diameter, and on the eaH fide, within 
“ the circle or area, two more rows of like Hones, including a fpace of about eight 
“ yards by four.

At about the diftance of a mile further from the town of Kefwick, we gained a 
view of that vale, which hafty travellers have miftaken for the vale of St. John, 
from the circumftance, that both the valley of Wanthwaite and the vale of St.
John lie in the chapelry of St. John ; the mountains of Naddle-fell divide the two 
vales.
— It is the vale oj IVanthwaite that chiefly obtains the attention of travellers, 
and it was there Mr. Pennant fays — “ Have a ftrange and horrible view down- 
wards, into a deep and mifly vale, at this time appearing bottomlefs, and wind- 
“ ing far amidft: the mountains, darkened by their height, and the thick clouds 
“ that hung on their fummits.” — It is a very narrow dell, hemmed in by moun- 
tains, through which a brook, having received a fifler-ftream, makes many 
meanders, wafhing little inclofures of grafs ground, which flretch up the feet of 
the hills.

On the 2'2d of Augufl:, 1749, a remarkable flood happened in the vale.
Mr..
Smith publiflied the following account of it in the Gentleman’s Magazine for 
1754 ; and he calls the valley by the name of the vale of St. John.
“ There happened, about four years ago, a mofl: dreadful ftorm of thunder and 
lightning, in thefe parts, which, burfting over the mountains, was attended with 
Ihch a torrent of rain, as confiderably changed the face of the country, and did 
“ incredible damage in the vale below.

you a more particular account of the effects of the (form, than has yet been 
“ publifhed.

“ when a water-cloud has been broken at the top, which very frequently hap- 
“ pens, and produces fuch rain, as the inhabitants of level countries have never 
feen.
Above thefe precipices, other mountains, ftill higher, terminate the view, 
“ and the vale below is a narrow but fertile fpot; the inhabitants of which have, 
" from time to time, removed the loofe (tones which were driven down upon 
“ them, and formed them by degrees into a fence againfl; the fury of other inunda- 
“ tions.
The hollows and channels which wind down the declivity, and when I 
“ faw them were dry, become gradually wider and more fliallow, as they defeend 
“ to that part of the mountains which is lefs ftcep ; the waters, in proportion as 
“ thev fpread, lofe their force, cover a larger tradf, and fall with lefs rapidity.
“ In the afternoon which preceded the Form, it was perceived to thunder and 
" lighten inceffantly beyond Skiddaw ; the cloud from which the tempefi; proceed- 
“ ed, came at length up to the mountain, but, not being high enough to pafs over 
it, divided ; one half of it w'ent away north-eaft, and, meeting with no oppofi- 
" tion, it difeharged a great quantity of water ©n the plains of Wigton and Carlifle,^ 
“ over which it hovered, till about nine o’clock at night, and then moved farther 
in the fame direcT;ion, but fo flowly, that its explofions were not out of hearing 
till two in the morning.
“ The other half went through a vale called Threlcot, and over the rocks on one 
fide of Kcfwick, called Lady Rocks, meeting no oppofition till it came to the 
“ mountains which bound St. John’s Vale, and by thefe it was flopped.
It be- 
“ came every moment more denfe, by the acceflion of vapours, which, being ftill 
“ in motion, prefled upon it, and foon after it poured down a torrent of rain, which 
“ lafted eight hours.
The thunder ftill continued, and the darknefs, which might 
“ almoft be felt, became more dreadful by the flafties, v/hich broke it at fhort in- 
“ tervals with a (ulphureous light : to the noife of the thunder, was added that of 
“ the cataracts, and of the fragments of the rock which they drove before them ; 
“ the fences were overtuined in a moment, the fields covered with the ruins of the 
mountains, under which the cottages were firft crufhed, and then fwept away by 
“ the torrent.
The inhabitants, who were fcarce lefs aftoniftied and terrified, than 
“ they would have been at the found of the laft trumpet, and the diflblution of 
“ nature, ran together from under the roofs that flteltered them, leaft they ftiould

THE VALE OF WANTHWAITE.
To this account, it is neceflary to add, that feveral cottages were fwept away 
from the declivities where they liood ; the vale v/as deluged, and many of the 
cattle were loft.
At 
^ Mr. Clarke, rvbo, in many inilances fliewed a ftrong pafiion for rough criticifm, and was pofleffed 
of much fclf fufficiency, gives the following account of the inundation — “ Near the eleventh mile Hone, 
flows Moufedale beck, which has its fource between the two eminences called Wolf-crag and the Dodd.
Travellers have been amufed with various fnflious accounts of an inundation which happened on the azd 
<lay of Auguft, 1749, and exaggerated circumftances have crept into the produftions of hafty writers, 
who thought proper to deferibe their journeys of pleafiue to the public.
We believe the following 
account to come very near the truth.
In the evening of the 2 2d of Auguft, nolfes were heard In the air, 
gufts of wind at Intervals burft forth with great violence, and were almoft inftantaneoufly fucceeded by a 
dead calm.
In this country the inhabitants are accuftomed to the bofom-vvinds and whirl-winds, the 
howling of the tempeft among the rocks and mountains gives them no ferious alarm : on this evening the 
inhabitants went to repofe at their ufual hour.
About one in the morning a heavy rain began, and be- 
fore four o’clock, the whole face of the lower country was covered with water many feet in depth : 
feveral hoyfes were beat down by the torrents, and others filled with fand to the firft ftory ; Legberthwalte 
mill was totally deftroyed, and not one ftone left upon another; even the millftones were wailicd away, 
one of them has not yet been difeevered, the other was found at fome confiderable diftancc.
The 
affrighted Inhabitants climbed the roofs of the houCes for prefervatlon, and there waited for the fubfiding 
of the waters.
One Mounfey of Wallthwalte, when he came down flairs in the morning, found his doors 
burft open by th.e violence of the floods, and utenfils and timber floating In his lower rooms.
At 
Lobthwaite, the moft remarkable veftiges of this inundation are to be feen ; ftones piled upon each other, 
to the height of ten or twelve yards, many of which are upwards of twenty ton weight.
The diftance 
between Lobthwaite and Wolf-crag is not more than a mile and a half, and very little water could be 
collcfted above Wolf-crag ; the fall of rain or waterfpout did not extend above eight milts ; fo that it is 
aftonifliing fuch a quantity of water could fall in fo fmall a fpace of country.
At Fornfide all was devafta- 
tion ; trees were torn up by the roots, and immcpfe beds of wTeck and gravel covered the lands ; whilft 
at Mellfell, three miles diftant, the country men w'ere leading home their corn all night, in fair weather ; 
a praftice not unufual when there are figns of a change.
“ In this vale is a place called the Gnardhoufe, where are the remains of fome ftrong walls ; probably 
a watch-tow'er belonging to tlte Threlkelds, where they fccured their domeftics and cattle on the incur- 
fions of the borderers.” 
The following relation of the cffe£fs of the Inundation feems beft to be relied upon — “ This remarkable 
fall of water happened at nine o’clock In the evening on the 2 2d of Auguft laft» in the midft of the moft 
terrible thunder and inceffant lightning, ever known In that part, In the memory of the oldeft man living.
The preceding after noon having been extremely hot and fultry ; and, wbat feems very uncommon, and 
difficult to account for, the Inhabitants of the vale, of good credit, affirm to have heard a ftrange buzzing 
noife, like that of a malt-miU, or die found of wind in the tops of trees, for two hours together, before 
the clouds broke.
“ I am not fo much a philofopher, as to find out what would occafion fuch a vaft coileftion of clouds 
or vapours, particularly at that time and place, but am fatisfied, from the havock It lias made in fo ffiort 
a tiuie, (for it was all over ui lefs than two hours) that it muft have far exceeded any thunder fliower that 
we hav'e ever feen : moft probably a fpout, or- large body of water, which, by the rarcfatlion of the air 
occafioned by that inceflant llghtiilug, broke all at once upon the tops of thefe mountains, and fo came 
down In a flicct ot water upon the valley below.
“ This little valley of St. John lies eaft and weft, extending about three miles In length, and half a mile 
broad, clofed in on the fouth and north fides with prodigious high, fttep, rocky mountains.
Thofe on 
the north fide, erdjed Legburtbet-fdls, had almoft the whole of this- cataradl, for I do not find that any re- 
markable quantity of water was obferved from thofe on the fouth, notwithllanding the diftance from the 
tops on each fide cannot be a mile.
It appears likewife, that this vaft fpout did not extend above a mile 
in length; for It had effcdl only upron four fmall brooks, which came trickling down the fides of the

THE VALE OF WANTHWAITE.

At Goof exvell -Hill there is a beautiful view into the vale of St. John.* 
St. John’s is one of the dependant chapel ries of the church of Crofthwaire.
It 
was certified at 4I.

a year; but, by feveral augmentations, and the donation 
of Dr. Gafgarth before mentioned, feveral lands have been purchafed, and the 
At the bottom of Catcliety-gill, which is the name of one of the greateft, flood a mill and a kiln, which 
were entirely fwept away in five minutes time, and the place where they formerly flood now covered with 
huge rocks, and rubbifh three or four yards deep.
One of the millflones cannot be found, being covered 
as is fuppofed in the bottom of this heap of rubbifh.
“ In the violence of the florm, the mountain has tumbled fo fall down as to choke up the old courfe 
of this brook ; and, what is verj' furpriling, it has forced its way through a fliivery rock, where it now 
runs in a great chafm, four yards wide, and betwixt eight and nine deep.
“ In the courfe of each of thefe brooks, fuch monflrous flones, or rather rocks, and fuch vaft quanti- 
ties of gravel and fand, are thrown upon their little meadow fields, as render the fame abfolutely ufelefs, 
and ne^er to be recovered.
“It \TOuld furpafs all credit, to give the dlmenfions and weight of fome rocks, which are not only 
tumbled down the fleep parts of the mountain, but carried a confiderable way into the fields, feveral 
thrown upon the banks larger than a teem of ten hoifes could move.
Near a place called Lob^ath, v/c 
had the curiofity to meafure one carried a great way, which was fix hundred and feventy-fix inches, or 
near nineteen yards, about.
“ The damage done to the grounds, houfes, walls, fences, highways, and the lofs of the corn and hay 
then upon the ground, is computed varioufly ; by fome at loocl.
by others at ijool.
“ One of thefe brooks, which is called Moje, or Mofedale heck, which rifes near the fource of the other, 
but runs north from the other fide of Legbuithet fells, continues ftill to be foul and muddy, having worn 
(as is fuppofed) its channel fo deep in fome parts of its courfe, as to work upon fome mineral fubftance, 
which gives it the colour of water hufhed from lead-mines, which is fo llrong as to tinge the river 
Derwent, (into which it empties iifelf) even at the fea, near twenty miles.
“ Thefe are moll of the partieulars I could colledl concerning this wonderful deluge, which I leave for 
vou to pirt into fuch form as you think proper.
I fhall only add what Mr. Naughley was pkafed to favour 
me with, wliat he calls his “ philofophical account of this phenomenon, to his philofophical friend s” 
“ Sir, 
“ Tuefday, Auguft 22d, 1749, w'as the befl hay-day we had here that feafon, but about eio-ht 
o’clock at night it began to thunder, firft w'ellwards from Cockermouth, then in a few minutes after 
eafiwards from Penrith.
Thefe thunder-clouds, with equal force and contrary diredllons, met together 
upon the mountains above the valleys of St. John and Threlkeld, at Or about the great Dod and Cova- 
plke, and mull of confequence hover on or about them, and thereon vent water-fpouts, (but not fo on 
the valleys, otherwife than by the violent courfe of the brooks and rivulets from the one down to tlie 
other) which would increafe and perpetuate the lightning, fo fwift In motion, and vlfible to our eyes, but 
retard and obllruft the undulations of the air, which are far more flow In motion, and later In coming to 
our ears ; for any two fuch bodies as thick clouds, driven by contrary winds, and meeting together by 
equal force and contrary diieflions.
cannot Impel each other backwards or forwards, but mull remain at 
or about where they meet, and there exert their vigour ; which, in this cafe, mull be the teafon of fuch 
water-fpouts upon thefe mountains, and not In the valleys ; and alfo why the fight of the lightning was 
more tenible to our eyes, than the found of the thunder to our ears.
Like to this is the cafe of 
whirl-puffs.” 
“ I met witli another curious gcatlenian, who feemed to be of opinion, that this vail difeharge of 
water was not from the clouds, but an eruption of the mountain ; and that uncommon nolfe, fuch as is 
heard fi'om mount Aitna, or Vefuvius, fome days before a violent crudlation of fire and combullilc matter, 
labouring to be difeharged from the bowels of thofe mountains, — ^but this to me feems too chimerical.” 
Mr. Crotthwaite, of Kefwick, who then lived in St. John’s vale, confirms the latter account in all its 
circumllanccs.

We returned to Kefwick.
The romantic fcenes upon the lake, induced us to 
take a boat at night, under favour of the moon, which was near the full, Wc 
began our voyage foon after the moon was rifen, and had illumined the top ol 
Skiddaw, but, from the interesting mountains, had not (within the afeent of an 
hour) reached the lake ; wc we^furrounded with a folemn gloom ; the ftillnefs of the 
evening rendered the voice of the waterfalls tremendous, as they, in all their vari- 
ety of founds, were re-echoed from every cliff.
— Thefummits of the rocks, when 
they began to receive the riling rays, appeared as if crowned with turrets of lilver, 
from which the flars departed for their nightly round.
As the gloom below 
grew deeper, objedls around us feemed to rife to view, as furging on the lirft 
morning from chaos.
The water was a plain of fable, lludded over with gems 
refledled from the ffarry firmament; the groves which hung upon the feet of the 
mountains were wrapt in darknels ; and all below was one grave and majeftic 
circle of Skiddaw,

When the long protraded lhades the mountains caff on the bofom of the lake 
Ihewed the vaftnefs of thofe maffes from whence they proceeded ; and ffill as the 
moon arofe higher in the horizon, the diffant objeds began to be more illumined, 
and the whole prefented us with a noble moon-light piece, delicately touched by 
the hand of nature ; and far furpalling thofe humble fcenes which we had often 
viewed in the works of the Flemilh painters.
— Miffs began to arife on the lake, and by reafon of the air which bore them 
aloft, being confined and eddying within this deep circle, they were whirled round, 
and carried upwards like a column, which, fo foon as it approached the rays of the 
moon, had a moff wonderful appearance, and refembled a pillar of light.f

It was formerly in St. Herbert’s chapel, on the ifland in the lake.
Among other amufements lately introduced at Kefwick, was the Regatta, and the fports at 
Pocklington Ifland.
We cannot prefent the reader with a more proper defetiption of thofe diverfions, than what appeared 
in the Cumberland Pacquet in the year 1781 ; — “ At eight o’clock in the morning, a vaft concourfe of 
ladies and gentlemen appeared on the fide of the Derwent Lake, where a number of marquees, extending 
about four hundred yards, were erefted for their accommodation.
At twelve, fuch of the company as 
were Invited by Mr. Pocklington pafled over in boats to the ifland which bears his name ; and, on their 
landing, were fainted by a difeharge of his artillery, which are one nine-pounder and five four-pounders.
This might propetly be called the opening of the Regatta ; for as foon as the echo of this difeharge had 
ceafed, a fignal gun was fired, and five boats, which lay upon their oars, (on that part of the water which

of

A view from any 
of the attendant boats, (of which there were feveral) prefented a feene which beggars all defeription.
— 
’I’he fides of the hoary mountains were clad with fpedlators, and th.e glafly furface of the lake 
was variegated with numbers of pleafure barges, which, tricked out In all the gayeil colours, and glitter- 
ing in the rays of the meridian fun, gave a new appearance to the celebrated beauties of this matchlefs 
vale.
“ The contending boats paffed Pocklington’s Ifland, and rounding Sr. Herbert’s and Rampfholme, 
edged down by the outfide of Lord’s Ifland ; defcribing in the race almod a perfeft circle, and, during 
the greateft part of it, in full view of the company.
“ About three o’clock preparations were made for the fham-attack on Pocklington’s Ifland.
The 
fleet (confiding of feveral barges, armed with fmall cannon and rnuiquets) retired out of view, behind 
Friar-Crag, to prepare for aftion : previous to which a flag of truce was fent to the governor, witli a 
fummons to furrender upon honourable terms.
A defiance was returned ; foon after which the fleet was 
feen advancing with great fpirit before the batteries, and inllantly forming a curved line, a terrible 
cannonading began on both fides, accompanied with a dreadful difeharge of mufquetry.
This continued 
for fome time, and being echoed from hill to hill in an amazing variety of founds, filled the ear with what- 
ever could produce attonilhment and awe.
All nature feemed to be in an uproar ; which imprefled on 
the awakened imagination the mofl; lively ideas of the “ war of elements,” and “ crufli of worlds.” — 
After a fevere conflift, the enemies were driven from the attack in great diforder.
A feu-de-joye was then 
fired in the fort, and oft repeated by the refponfive eclioes.
The fleet, after a little delay, formed again j 
and praftifing a variety of beautiful manceuvres, renewed the attack.
Uproai again fprung up, and the 
deep-toned echoes of the mountains again joined in folemn chorus ; which was heard, to the diflance of 
ten leagues to leeward, through the eaflerly opening of that vaft amphitheatre, as far as Appleby.
“ The garrifon at laft capitulated ; and the entertainment of the water being finiflied, (towards the 
evening) the company moved to Kefwick ; to which place, from the water’s edge, a range of lamps was 
fixed, very happily difpofed, and a number of fire-works difplayed off.
An afl'embly-room (which was 
biiik for the purpofe) next received the ladles and gentlemen, and a dance concluded this annual feftivity.
A chain of amulements, which we may venture to affert no other place can poflibly furnifli, and which 
wants only to be more univerfally known, to render it a place of more general refort than any in the 
kingdom.
“ AVliilft we fat to regale, the barge put off from fliore to a ftatlon where the fineft echoes were to 
be obtained from the furrounding mountains.
The veffel was provided with fix brafs cannon mounted 
on fwivels : on difeharging one of tliefe pieces, the report was echoed from the oppofite rocks, where, by 
reverberation, it feemed to roll from cliff to cliff, and return through every cave and valley, till the de- 
creafing tumult died away upon the ear.
“ The inftant it ceafed, the found of every diftant water-fall was heard ; but for an inftant only j for 
the momentary ftlllncfs was interrupted by the leturning echo on the hills behind ; where the report was 
repeated like a peal of thunder burfling over our heads, continuing for feveral feconds, flying from haunt 
to haunt, till once more the found gradually declined.
Again the voice of water-falls poffeffed the inter- 
val, till, to the right, the more diftant thunder arofe upon fome other mountains, and feemed to take its 
way up ever)' ending dale and creek ; fometimes behind, on this fide, or on that, in wondrous fpeed 
running its dreadful courfe : when the echo reached the mountains within the line and channel of the 
breeze, it was heard at once on the right and left at the extremities of the lake.
In this manner was 
the report of every difeharge re-echoed feven times dIftIu<fHy.”

A deferiptive poem appeared on the fubjedl of the Regatta at Kefwick, in 1786, which we think 
has poetic merit : — 
“ O Mufe !
that nightly gliding thro’ the hall 
Of tuneful Ollian gently touch’d his harp, 
And fweeping oft unfeen the living firing.
With airy fingers firuck the fancy’d note, 
Believ’d the mufic of departed Bards.
Oh !
thou that fitt’fi amidfi the circling fiones.
Crown’d with the facred mifletoe !
thy hand, 
Grac’d with a feemly bough of Britain’s oak, 
(Thatoak which bears her thunders round the globe.
When fire affrights the difiant realms with war) 
Attend ; and tune thy golden harp to notes 
Of joy exulting : fing the fefiive day.
When, on the azure mirror of the lake.
The princely Hoivard held his fplendid feafi ; 
When he himfelf, mofi like the god of mirth, 
In placid grandeur view’d the noble feene.
Scarcely had day's bright god begun his courfe, 
And chac’d the mifiy vapoui'S from the lake.
When, ardent all for pkafure, forth there fprung 
A bright aflemblage of firm, adtive youths.
And virgins blufliing like tlie op’ning bud.
Nay, fome there-were who fought the fportive feene 
Whom frozen age had bow’d with iron hand ; 
Drawn by the force of curiofity.
Or by the workings of parental care.
To watch and guard thcirblooming daughter’sfieps.
The neighb’ring rufiics too, with maffy limbs.
Inur’d to toil.
Inur’d to fun and rain ; 
Each led his fav’rite damfcl to the fight, 
And talk’d of love, or laugh’d with hearty roar.
And now the veffels all in order range.
To try the fortune cf the wat’ry.race.
The rowers fit ; their eyes with ardour glow, 
Attentive watching the appointed fign.
And now the gun, the fignal.for the courfe.
Rends with its iron voice th’ o’ervaulting flty.
And difiant rocks redoubling echo back 
The horrid note.
— Infiantly they fiait.
And, adverfe looking, try their utmoft flcill.
Big fwells each bulky mufcle, firain’d « ith toil ; 
O’er their knit brows the drops of labour pour, 
Whilfi on their faces anxious fear and hope 
Alternate fat dep'idted.
Now they come 
Almofi within the grafp of "Viftory : 
Then, then what rapture fires the vidlor’s mind, 
When with his toll-firaln’d arm he fiiakes the flag.
And flrouts applauding echoes all around.
Now o’er the azure lake the horrid din 
Of mimic war refounds ; the echoing cliffs 
Reverberate, in doubled thnndcr, back 
The awful founds ; fierce peal fnccecds to peal, 
In favage dire confufion.
Had the rocks.
Which awful frown above this limpid plain.
Been fhaken from their venerable feats,.
Rift by the bolts of Jove, and-fcatter’d round.
No found more loud, more awful, could be heard !
The hero, who inur’d to bloody war 
H as flood by Elliot, or by Rodney’s fide, 
Whilfi million winged deaths w^ere vvhifiling round.
Now feels his heart beat high; firong throbs each

His kindling eyes fiafh fire : upright he fiands.
As when on fome dread, memorable day.
He faw the Frenchmen firike, or Spaniards burn.
His tender fpoufe, the dear, the foft reward 
Of all his toils, afionifii’d with the din.
Clings to his fide, half pleas’d and half afraid ; 
When fofter echoes roll the difiant roar.
She fmiles ; but when the air-affrighting guns 
With iron clarr.ours fliake th’ Impending rocks.
She trembling preffes hard her hufband’s hand, 
And weeps to think the perils he has ’fcap’d.
But, hark !

The mellow horns now pour vidlorlous founds, 
Whilfi every rock returns the foften’d ftrain.
Oh !

To paint his mingled tide of harmony !
Each cliff, each rock, each mountain, wood, and 
dale, 
Return a varied note ; it floats In air ; 
It mixes, meets, returns ; ’tis foft, ’tis loud : 
As if th’ unnumber’d fpirits of the rock 
Held their aerial concerts ’midfi the hills ; 
And to his golden harp each join’d his voice, 
To welcome to their bow’r the Fairy Queen.

— Every bay and promontory aflumed an appearance different from what it had 
by day-light; — the little dells which wind round the feet of the mountains, as 
they were fliadow'cd by interpofing objects, or filvered by the moon, afforded moff 
enchanting feenes ; where we could have wandered long with delight.
— Where the lake narrows, and runs up in a creek towards Borrowdale, the

KESWICK.
Skiddaw, which, by the winding pafs, we were obliged to make, afforded a labo- 
rious afeent of five miles : the profpeeff from this eminence well rewarded our 
fatigue.
To the fouth-eaff, we had a view over the tops of mountains, one fuc- 
ceeding to and overlooking the other; a feene of chaos and mighty confiilion : 
this was the prolpecft which Dr. Brown deferibed by the image of “ a tempeffuous 
fea of mountains.” Below us lay the lake, with all the beauties of its margin, 
together with the vale of Kefwick and the w aters of BalTenthwaite, as if delineated 
on a chart.
To the fouth-weft, the hills towards Cockermouth, though lefs 
rugged and romantic than thofe to the fouth-eaff, were yet not lefs ftupendous.
— 
To the north-weff, we had the profpecl; of a wide country, ill cultivated, and ter- 
minated with w'ide and barren heath, which extended its plains to Carlifle; and the 
view was terminated by the Scotch mountains.
To the north-eaff we regained the 
profped: of that fpacious circus, in which Penrith was deferibed to be feated.

to be performed with a kind of afthmatic oppreffion.
— “ Whilll we remained upon the mountain, over the hills which lay between Kefwick and Cocker- 
mouth, denfe and dark vapours began to arife ; and in a little time, as they advanced upon a fouth-weft 
wind, concealed thofe heiglits we had viewed half an hour before clear and diftiiuff.
Our guide was 
very earneft with us to quit the mountain, as he prognofticated the hazard of being wet, and of lofing 
our way in the heavy vapour, from a ftorm then collefting, which he affuted us would fbon cover 
Skiddaw ; — the circumftance was too fingular to be left by people curious in their obfervations on natural 
events.
— The clouds advanced with accelerated fpeed ; — a hollow blaft founded amongft the hills and 
dells w'hich lay below, and feemed to fly from the approaching darknefs ; — the vapour rolled down the 
oppofite valley of Newland, and appeared to tumble in mighty fheets and volumes from the brow of each 
mountain, into the vale of Kefwick, and over the lakes.
— “ Whim we admired this phenomenon, the clouds below us gradually afeended, and we foon found 
the fummit of Skiddaw totally furrounded, whilft we on every fide looked down upon an angry and im- 
petuous fea, heaving its billows.
We were rejoicing in this grand fpedlaclc of nature, and thinking 
ourftlves fortunate in having beheld fo extraordinary an event, when, to our aftonilhment and confufion, 
a violent burft of thunder, engendered in the vapour below, ftunned our fenfe, being repeated from every 
rock, and down every dell ; at the fame time, from the agitation of the air, the mountain feemed to 
tremble ; — at the cxplofioii, the clouds were inftantaneoufly illumanated, and from innumerable chafm* 
fent forth ftreams of lightning ; — we had no where to fly for fafety, no place to cover our heads ; to de- 
feend, was to rufli into the infiarr^mable vapour from whence our perils proceeded ; to ftay was equally 
hazardous ; for now the clouds, which had received fuch a concuffion from the thunder, afeended higher 
and higher, enveloping the whole mountain, and letting fall a heavy flrower of rain ; — we thought our- 
felvcs happy, even under this circumftance, to perceive the ftorm turning north-weft, and to hear the next 
clap burft in.

in the heights of the Alps, from whence the thunder-ftorms are fecn palling over the countries beneath 
them.

Lodore, were noble, and gave a repetition of the thunder-claps diftindlly, though diftant, after an inter- 
miflion of feveral feconds of tremendous filence.
— “ The rain, which ftill increaled, formed innumerable ftreams and cafeades, which rulhed from the 
crown of Skiddaw, Saddleback, and Caufey-pike, with a mighty noife ; but we were deprived of the

confifting of cuftomary tenants.
It was part of the pofTcftTons which the fixth Earl 
of Northumberland gave to King Henry VIII.
— The king, by letters patent of the 
15th of July, in the 35th year of his reign, granted the fame to Thomas Dalfton, 
Efq. together with the manors of Uldale, Caldbeck, Upperton, and Kirkbride.

It afterwards was the eftate of the Tolfons of Woodhall, who fold the fame to Mr.
Relph of Cockermouth, after whofe death it came to the family of Dalemain, with 
whom it ftill continues: it comprehends the feveral villages of Brundham, 
Applcthwaite, Milnbeck, and Syzick ; well fhaded with wood on the north fide of 
the river Bure.
— About thirty-four cuftomary tenants pay arbitrary fines ; the 
freeholders are about thirty-eight in number.

The well lies near Grange, f three miles from Kefwick.
It is a ftrong brine of inland fait.
The water was whitifh with oil of tartar ; white with fugar of lead ; and exhibited a white fediment, 
with a folution of filver.
It w^as green with fyrup of violets, and red with logwood.
THE ANALYSIS.
This is much ftronger than the xvater of the German ocean ; for whereas fcarce a 2 2d part of that ia 
fait, a 1 6th pait of this is pure fait, for it yields half a pound from a gallon.
The fediment in grofs, fent me by Dr. Short, was adtually warm on the tongue, of a brackifli and 
bitterifh tafte.
It caufed a violent ebullition and acid fume with oil of vitriol ; fome fmall, fcarce fenfible, froth with 
fpirit of fait ; lay ftill with vinegar.
It was of a duflcy green, with fyrup of violets in the middle, and pu.-ple at the edges.
It quite liquified in the air, even as much or more than the refiduum of our Francis-ftreet water.
It crackled a little on the red-hot iron, and flunk.
The folution of two drams of the fait in a quart of diflilled water, boiled to a pint and a half, is of a 
brackifh tafle, and bitter in the throat.
It prefently exhibited a grofs white grume with oil of tartar, and with fpirit of fal ammoniac ; and 
fome fmall grumes with folution of fugar of lead.
A ftiff white grumous fediment with folution of filver.
The fait in fubftance, boiled in the proportion of half a dram to half a pint of milk, curdled it with a 
clear whey ; which, and the appearances with the tincturing articles, are an argument of fome acid 
adhering: viz.
the above folution was purple w’ith fyrup of violets ; from logwood it cxtiaCled little 
tincture, except fome reddifhnefs at bottom ; from brazil an exceeding pale orange, from rhubarb a yel- 
low, from afli-bark very little of a blucnefs, from fumach little tinClure, from galls a green one.
The folution or deliquium of the fait in the air, had a very powerful effeCl in attenuating the blood.
The proportion of indiffoluble matter to the fait w’as but very fmall ; and moreover it was of a lingu- 
lar nature, not fermenting with vinegar, nor even with oil of vitriol, but it fparkled greatly on the red- 
hot iron.
V. • 
COROLLARY.
From the bitterifli taile of both the fediment and folution, from the above-deferibed effeCls of the 
folution on the feveral tinCluring articles, and particularly galls ; from the effeCls of the fame folution of 
tlie lltength mentioned on alkalies, and from the coagulating elfeCl of the fait on milk ; this water 
appears to have a nitre or bittern combined with the marine fait, and withal to border more upon the 
acid than moft of the falts impregnating the faline fpringshere examined, except that near Carrickfergus.
The operation and virtues are thus deferibed in the fame author ; — “ It is a rough, fevere purge and 
vomit, heats the body much, and excites thirll; and nctwithllanding the harfhnefs of its operation, wants 
not its cuftomers and admirers ; and indeed in dropfical, cacochymic, and cacheAic diforders, foulnefs of 
the ftomach, flipperinefs of the bowels from relaxations, from much mucus, and fome idlerltious dif- 
orders, it is of fervice to feveral.”

The dale opens

One would hardly have conceived Mr, Weil would have faid “ Mr. Gray’s 
account of Barrowfide, and his relation of Borrowdale, are hyperboles, and the 
“ fport of fancy that he was pleafed to indulge himfelf in,” when he had proved to 
us, no labour of the artift, or effervefcence of genius, could exceed the mighty 
figures he had brought forth in his defeription of Borrowdale; where he fays

“ grow iroxx\ rocks, and rocks appear like trees ” — “ fublimely terrible ;” — and in 
the lake he faw “ fpar at the bottom, Jhining like diamonds , and glittering in diverfity

We mufi: not negle< 5 l the accounts given by other vifitors, — Mr. Clarke informs 
his readers, that “ Borrowdale, till within thefe laft thirty years, \vas hardly in a 
“ Bate, even of civilization ; the furface of the ground w^as very little cultivated* 
“ for agriculture was not underfiood there, and the inhabitants were a proverb, even 
“ among their unpolifhed neighbours, for ignorance.
Not above twenty years ago 
" (publication dated 1787) a cart, or any kind of w'heel carriage, was totally unknown 
“ in Borrowdale; in carrying home their hay, (for they make no Backs) they lay 
" it upon their horfes in bundles, one on each fide; yet, Brange to tell, fo bigotted 
" are the inhabitants, even of the more civilized parts, that they obBinately adhere to 
“ this abfurd cuBom : the traveller may even fee hay carried in this manner through 
“ the Breets of Kefwick; and, if he afks the reafon, he will meet with no other 
“ anfwer, than that it is an old cuBom. Their manure they carry in the fame 
“ manner, putting it in wicker bafkets : in the fame manner they carried the 
fmall wood for firing ; the larger logs they trailed or dragged.
Their food in 
” fummer confiBed of fifii and fmall mutton ; in winter they lived upon bacon 
“ and hung mutton.
Nor was their manner of drying their mutton lefs rude ; 
“ they hung their flieep up by the hinder legs, and took away nothing but the 
“ head and entrails.
In this fituation, I have feen feven fheep hanging in one 
“ chimney, and have been told of much greater numbers.” 
He then tells us a ridiculous Bory of the people’s purfuing a red deer Bag, which 
efcaped them ; and the moB of them, he fays, were thoroughly convinced they 
had been chacing a witch.

Their dialedt is likewifc 
very different from the general dialed of the country ; in all their words they

The lands from Barrovnbeck to 
** above High~Lodore belong to Rowland Stephenfon, Efq. and are freehold ; the 
** lands in Borrowdale are freehold, but pay a fmall quit-rent to Sir Wilfrid 
** Lawfon’s family.” 
Mr. Gilpin’s fleps are next purfued by us — “ As we proceeded in our route along 
•• the lake, the road grew wilder and more romantic.
As we edged the precipices, 
** we every where faw fragments of rocks and large ftones fcattered about, which, 
** being loofened by frofts and rains, had fallen from the cliffs above ; and fhew 
** the traveller what dangers he has efcaped.
The Lodore and the Derwent fur- 
nifh the chief fupply of Derwentwater.
The Lodore is loft in the lake ; while 
“ the Derwent, giving its name to it, retains its own to the fea.
On pafilng this 
river, and turning the firft great promontory on our left, we found ourfelves in 
a vaft recefs of mountains.
The windings of the Derwent was the clue we fol- 
lowed in our paffage through thefe regions of defolation.
An aperture between 
“ the mountains brought us into another wild recefs, where a fimilar feene opened; 
** diverfified from the firft only by fome new forms, or new pofition, or varied 
** furniture, of the incumbent mountains.
This valley, fo replete with hideous 
grandeur, is known by the name of the Straits of Borrowdale.’’ 
A little further advanced in the dale, beyond the Grange, is a large ftone, called 
the Bowdar stone, faid to be equal to the hulk of a firft-rate man of war in lize j 
by its pofition, refted on fome fragments of rock, and lying almoft hollow, it 
ftrikes 
BORROWDALE.
2rr 
ftrikcs the vifitor with an idea, that it was one of the rocking Rones of the ancients : 
and, if fo, it was the rnoft ftupendous in Britain.
The name feems to point out 
to us, that it was anciently of importance; but what that was, no etymology 
or tradition that we could gain, hath difcovcred: the divifion of Baw-divir will not 
fufficiently prove it was of religious ufe, we fear, it has in fome age been fevered 
from the cliffs above by fome mighty concuflion, or the ftroke of a thunder-bolt; 
the veins of the Rone being exadly fimilar to thofe of the adjoining precipice and 
rock.* 
The road leads clofe by the foot of this aRonifliing mafs.
From thence the 
feenes, by the winding of the vale, are, every Rep you advance, changing and 
various, and fuch as are fcarce to be found in any other traft : Rupendous cliffs, 
here and there Rruck wdth a fcanty herbage, or a few fhrubs; mountains Riaken 
and piled one on the other, in the moR rude and romantic form.
But half a mile 
above the Bowdar Rone, the feene becomes magnificent to its higheR excellence.
The vale opens to the right and left ; the rocks on every fide are almoR perpen- 
dicular, their fronts and fummits naked and white with the beating of Rorms : 
defeription fails, and language hath not expreflion to convey the images to the 
mind.
On one hand are the Eagles’ Cliffs, and mountains rich with the wad- 
mines ; on the other a chain of hills equally Rupendous, which Rretch away to 
HawkRiead.
“ In this deep retreat lies the village of Rosthwaite, having at all times little 
intercourfe with the country ; but, during half the year, almoR totally excluded 
from all human commerce.
Their fcanty patches of arable land, and thefe cul- 
tivated with difficulty ; and their crops late ripening, and often a prey to 
“ autumnal rains, which are violent in this country, juR give them bread to ear.
** Their herds afford them milk, and their flocks cloaths ; the Riepherd himfelf 
being often the manufadurer.
No die is neceffary to tinge their wool, it is 
naturally a ruffet brown, and Rieep and ihepherds are cloathed alike; both in 
the Ample livery of nature.
The procuring of fuel is among their greatcR hard- 
Riips.
In moR parts of the world this article is fought, either in pits, or on the 
" furface of the earth.
Here the inhabitants are obliged to procure it from the 
** tops of mountains, which, abounding with moffy grounds, feldom found in the 
** valleys below, fupply them with peat.
The difficulty lies in conveying them 
*' from fuch immenle heights.
In doing this, they have recourfe to a Rrange and 
dangerous expedient, though Amilar to the modes of conveyance which neceffity 
didates in other mountainous countries.
They make their peat into bundles^ 
* “ In the middle of one of the recefies of the valley lies an enormous ftone, which is called in the 
countTy Boother-Jione.
Mafly rocks of immenfe fize, rent from mountains, are every where found : bet 
this ftone appears to be of a different kind.
It does not feem to have been the appendage of a mountain, 
but itfelf an independent creation.
It lies in a fort of diagonal pofition, overfhadowing a fpace fufficient 
$0 Jl^elter a troop ofhorfe.” Gilpin.
« It is a looic ftone, laid upon a rock, and is almoft in the form of an egg ; fome have compared It 
to a (hip lying upon her keel.
It meafures thirty-one yards in lengthy and eight yards perpendicular height 
It muft therefore weigh upwards of fix hundred ton ; and is faid to be the largeft felf ftone in 
England.”— CLAR.K.E.

“ and fallen it upon fledges ; on each of which a man fits, and guides the machine 
with his foot down the precipices.
We faw many tracks along the fides of 
mountains, made by thefe fledges ; feveral of which were four or five hundred 
“ feet high, and appeared from the bottom almofl: perpendicular.
“ From Rofthwaite, the valley purfues its courfe towards the eafi ; and, lofing 
again its milder features, grows on every ftep more wild and defolate.
After a 
march of two miles further, we came to the village of Satterthwaite, ftill more 
intrenched in mountains than Rollhwaite.

to be met with.f Mr. Robinfon, in his Natural Hiftory of Weftmorland and 
Cumberland, fays — Its compofition is a black, pinguid, and fliining earth, im- 
" pregnated with lead and antimony.
Its natural ufes are both medicinal and 
mechanical.
It is a prefent remedy for the cholic ; it eafeth the pain of gravel, 
flone, and Ilrangury : and, for thefe and the like ufes, it is much bought up by 
” apothecaries and phyficians, who underftand more of its medicinal ufes, than I 
“ am able to give an account of.
The manner of the country people’s ufing it is 
" thus : firft they beat it fmall into meal, and then take as much of it, in white 
" wine or ale, as w ill lie upon a fixpence, or more, if the diftemper require it.
It 
“ operates by urine, fvveat, and vomiting.
This account 1 had from thofe who 
frequently had ufed it -in thefe diflempers with good fuccefs.
Befides ihofc ufes 
“ that are medicinal, it hath many other ufes which increafe the value of it.
At 
“ the firft difeovering it, the neighbourhood made no other ufe of it, but for 
“ marking their fheep ; but it is now made ufe of to glaze and harden crucibles, 
“ and other veffels, made of earth or clay, that are to endure the hottefl fire, and to 
** that end it is wonderfully eficdtual, which much enhanced the price of fuch 
“ velTcls.
By rubbing it upon iron arms, as guns, piftois, and the like, and 
tinging them with its colour, it preferves them from ruffing.
It is made ufe of 
“ by dyers of cloth,* making their blues fland unalterable.
For thefe and other 
“ ufes, it is bought up at high prices by the Hollanders and others.
This mundic 
“ ore, having little of fulphur in its compofition, will not flow without a violent 
“heat.

It cannot be made

“ Bifliop Nicolfon, in a letter to Dr. Woodward, 5th Auguft, 1710, fpeaks of 
“ this mine as foilow's — “ Having lately had notice of the opening of our wad- 
“ mines above Kefwick, I hafled with fome others to fee a curiofity which 1 never 
“ hitherto h.ad an opportunity of viewing, and, if this were omitted, I was never 
“ likely to have another.
From Kefwick, wx travelled up the valley of Borrow- 
“ dale, along the banks of Derwentwater, fix or feven miles or more, till we came 
“ to Seethwaite moor, whee, afeending a high mountain, we at length reached 
“ the mine, and were courteoufly received by Mr. Shepherd, one of the pro- 
“ prietors of the work, who was here waiting for his copartner, Mr. Banks.
On 
“ the firff opening of the old level in the latter end of June lafi, great difeourage- 
“ ments appeared ; for no fearch having been made in thirty-two years, they 
f “ Somewhat farther on this fide, than Eagles’-crag lies on the other, rife thofe mountains where the 
celebrated black-lead mine is wrought ; we faw the llte of the mine at a diftance, marked with a dingy- 
yellow ftain, from the ochery mixtures thrown from its mouth, which fhiver down the fides of the moun- 
tains.
During the pcnodical feafon of working it, for it is opened only once in feven years, many 
people pick up a comfortable fubfiftence from the feraps of black-lead, which efcape amongft the coarfer 
ftrata.
Thefe are honeft gains.
But a little prolific genius in fraud took a very indireft method of 
pofTefling a fhare of this rich mineral.
A part of the mountain contiguous to the mine was his pro- 
perty.
Here, at the cxpence of great labour, he fank a fhaft, which he carried diagonally, till he entered 
the mine ; where, with fecret joy, he continued his depredations for fome time undifeovered.
At length 
his fraud was brought to light, and he was tried at Carlifle, The peculiarity of his cafe had no precedent.
He faved his life ; but a law was obtained by the proprietors of the mine, to defend their property from

found that fome pilfering interlopers had carried on the old work, till they had 
loll it in the rock.
Upon the 3d of July (the day before we got thitherj a new 
“ belly was happily difcovered before the forehead of the Old Man,^ which proved 
fo rich, that in lefs than twenty-four hours they had filled feveral facks with fine 
and clean-wafhed mineral.
It lies intermixed with a hard greenifli rock, but 
appeared in the midfl: of that of a full round vein or body, of above three feet in 
diameter.
Dr. Merret, in his Pinax, p.
2 1 8, would perfuade one to believe, that 
this mineral is fo very fcarce, that it is no where in the univerfe to be met with, 
fave only in Old and New England ; and that this is the only place within the 
“ four feas, where it can be had with us : whereas Sir Robert Sibbald§ allures us 
“ that it may be had in the fliire of Aberdeen, the defcription and natutal hifiory 
whereof is now under his confidcration ; and Mr. Dales, invenilur injodinis, would 
induce one to believe it a very common mineral.
Nay the author laft mentioned 
particularly reckons up three feveral forts of it, brought from as many difiant 
“ countries; whereof he allows that of our Englifh growth to be the beft, that of 
Spain the next, and condemns what is brought from the Eaft Indies as the worft 
of all.
It is ftrange that it fliould be the natural produce of fo many parts of 
the globe, and yet Father Kircher, in the Mundus Subterraneus, fhould have no 
account of it ; and, ftranger yet, that none of the ancient naturalifts fliould fo 
much as touch upon the name or thing.
Neither the Melanteria nor Pingitis 
“ of Diofcorides feems to me the leaft related to this mineral ; the former being 
defcribed as a fort of liquid ink diftilling from the veins of metals ; and the 
latter appears to be of the fame kind with that black-chalk which Dr, Plot 
found in Oxfordfliire.
That learned gentleman indeed elfe where falls in with 
“ Mr. Camden’s opinion,* that this black-lead (improperly fo called, for that is 
the right name of our common lead, as diftinguiflied from tin) is a fiony fort 
of black ochre, becaufe it is neither fubjecfi to fufion or dudility in the fire, or 
“ to a diflblution in the water.
Yet a fufion it muft have, if Dr. Leigh is to be 
“ credited,^ who aflerts that the Dutch ufe it in glazing their earthen pots, which 
“ he feems to confirm by an experiment tried in his own fight.
My fagacious 
neighbour, Mr, Robinfon,^ will have it to be a mundic ; which he afterwards 
more fully explains by a black, pinguid, and fhining earth, impregnated with 
“ lead and antimony.
It will, he fays, flow with a great heat, but cannot be made 
“ malleable.
What he reports of its eafing the pains of gravel, fione, and 
“ firangury, is more than is confirmed to me; bur the neighbours generally 
“ fubferibe to this aflTertion, of its being a prefent remedy for the cholic.
That 
“ the dyers ufe it for ftrengthning their blues, is more than I have heard from any 
“ other hand.

“ hdent that, not only the ufes but the matter of both are the famej and that this 
Nigrica Fabrilis and his Kellow differ no otKerwife, than that the former name 
was happily coined by himfelf, and well exprefles the true meaning of the latter.
Sir Robert Sihbald tells us that his countrymen gave the name of Keel to the 
“ Rubrica Fabrilis^ or common ruddle-ftone, and that the Nigrica is called by them 
“ Killoyne.

Minie^hy and Vinney in their language, which is the fame as Caotl.>y blind or dark.
We arc likevvife told, that the men of Kefwickf (where are alfo many remains 
of the Irifli or Manks tongue} call their black-lead, indifferently, either Kellow 
or IVadf; the latter of which is doubtlefs from the Saxon name of PVoad or

by experience to be neceffary for divers ufeful purpofes, and more particularly 
in the calling of bomb-fliells, round fhot, and canon-balls.”* 
It is reported here, that thefe mines w'ere firft difeovered by the blowing dowm

place here.— It is indeed a very fingular fubftance, but being very common, and 
confequently very well known, it would be needlefs to deferibe it.
It is found 
but in very trivial quantities in feveral mines here, and it may be alfo in other 
countries but the foie mine in which it is found by itfelf, is in Borrowdale, 
about fix miles from Kefwick, in the county of Cumberland.
It is there called 
I'Fads and thofe who are befl; acquainted with it, ftile it a black pinguid fliining 
earth, which they fuppofe to be impregnated with lead and antimony.
— W hen 
it was firft difeovered, the people ufed it to mark their flieep e it was afterwards 
introduced into medicine, and taken in powder for the cure of the cholic and 
gravel ; but it has been fince applied to many other purpofes.
It feryes to fcour, 
clean, and give a luftre to wrought iron, and defends it Irom ruft : it is applied 
in the varnilliing crucibles and other earthen vellels that are to be expefed to the 
fierceft fire, which end it anfwers effedtually: but after all, the great confumption 
of it is in two articles, in dying, to fix blues, fo that they may never change 
their colour, and in pencils.
The being confined to this country is fo well 
known, and fo univerfally allowed, that they are from thence ftiled abroad, 
Crayons d’Anglcterre.— It arifes from hence that this fubftance is little know'n 
to foreigners, the mofl: learned of whom fpeak of it very confufedly, and w iih 
much uncertainty.
— Thefe farther particulars we may venture to affirm concern- 
ing it, w'ithout any danger of mifleading our readers, that the mine before 
mentioned is private property, is opened but once in feven years, and the 
quantity known to be equal to the confumption in that fpace fold at once; and 
as it is ufed without any preparation, it is more valuable than the ore of any metal 
found in this ifland.
But there is nothing improbable, much lefs impoffible, in 
fuppofing that other, and it may be many other ules will be difeovered in 
medicine, painting, dying, varnifhing, or pottery, which would certainly con- 
tribute to raife the value of a mineral peculiar to this country ; and with the 
nature of which, though fo long in our pofTeffion, w'e are fiill fo impcrfcvftly 
acquainted.” 
The following defeription of a journey to the Wad-mines, is the mofi: copious 
e have met with : it was publiflicd in the Gent.
Mag. 1751 : — _ 
“ The public attention has been drawn to the black-lead mines in Cumberland, 
called the Wad-mines, by the account of their having been plundered, which has 
lately appeared in the papers: but as yet they have not been deferibed; and though 
it is not known that there is any other mine of the fame kind in the world, yet 
I believe they have never been vifited with a view to natural hiftory, except by 
myfclf, and fome gentlemen who went with me.
I therefore fend you the 
following narrative of our journey and difcoveiies.
(Signed) G.
S.” 
“ I had long intended a journey to the wad-mines, and had often been prevented 
from effecting it by unfavourable weather, and other accidents; but in the begin- 
ning ofAuguft, 1749, 1 fet out fromWigton, in company with two or three friends^ 
and had appointed others to meet us from Cockermouth, who waited only for 
my meffage to fet out; for in this expedition they had determined to bear me 
company.
From Wigton, in about three hours, we arrived at Orthwaite, a fmall 
village under mount Skiddaw.

“ fhelter in a little ale-houfe at this place, and an uninterrupted feries of bad 
weather kept us prifoners near a week; however, as the neighbouring clergy- 
“ man charitably viiited us every day, we did not much futFer by our confinement.
“ Here the gentlemen from Cockerrnouth joined us on the firft fair morning; and 
“ the afternoon being clear, we agreed to meet the next morning at Kcfwick, on 
“ the fouth fide of Skiddaw, I’his mountain contains a fifiile abforbing flare, 
" w hich is flaked ofl:' with a kind of wedge peculiarly adapted to the M ork, in 
“ quarries near the top of the mountain, and is conveyed down to the plain by 
“ labourers in a machine fo contrived as to be carried upon the flioulder, the man 
walking upright : in thefe machines, each man carries as much as would load a 
“ Cumberland cart ; but having, by long ufe, learnt to improve the advantage 
“ afforded by tl]e declivity of the mountain, they defeend with little labour and 
“ lefs hazard.
“ Skiddaw is undoubtedly one of the highefl mountains in Bi itain ; the declivity 
“ of which, from White- water-dalh, at the foot, to the fummit, mcafures near 
“ five thoufand yards; but the perpendicular height cannot be much more than 
“ one-fourth of that meafure.
The neighbouring mountains are all very high, 
“ and the greater part terminate in craggy precipices, which have the appearance 
of huge fragments of rock, irregularly heaped on one another; bur, in the 
profpecl round, nature has laviflied fuch variety of beauty as can fcarce be 
believed upon report, or imagined by the mofl luxuriant fancy.
The plains of 
" BaflTenthwaite, watered by a fine lake, appear like a paradife to the weft; and 
“ the iflands that lie interfperfed among the windings of Derwent, and the lake of 
“ Kefwuck, exceed defeription ; beyond thefe, to the fouth, lie the mountains of 
" Borrowdale, which are yet higher than Skiddaw : the w eftern feas, the Ifle of 
Mann, all the fouth coaft of Scotland, and the mountains of Pennygent and 
“ Ingleborough, in Yorkfliire, diverfify other parts of this delightful landfcape.
“ The fpot upon which I ftood is one intire fhiver of flate ; and the precipice to 
*' the weftward is frightful.
The plants of Skiddaw are the myrtle-berries, 
" generally called black-berries, the viris idaa of Diojeorides, mofs-berries, great 
“ variety of molTes, and among them the mufeus fquammofus pulcher digilatus of 
“ Tournefort.
“ On Friday morning, purfuant to our appointment, we fet out from Orthwaite, 
“ and our Cockerrnouth friends fell in with us before we reached Kefwick; fo that 
“ we ftayed there no longer than was neceffary to hire a guide, and confequcntly I 
“ had no time for critical obfervation.
It is diftant from Orthwaite feven com- 
puted miles, and forms the weft fide of the bafe of Skiddaw ; it is fkirted with 
the lake of BafTenthwaitc, which is about one mile wide, and five miles long; 
*' and, on the oppofite fide, Widehope-fells, with their impending woods, form, 
“ a very pleafing and romantic appearance.
The town feems to be ancient ; and 
” the poorer inhabitants fubfift chiefly by ftealing, or clandeftinely buying of thofe 
“ that fteal, the black-lead, which they fell to Jews, or other hawkers.
Near 
“ Kefwick is alfo another lake, near two miles broad, and four miles long, in which 
** fcveral iflands are interfperled, but not inhabited by German miners ; when I 
“ law them, they were fo many Ortygias, or iflands of Calypfo, covered with

** beautiful woods, which were then felling.
On one of thefe, called Lady JJland, 
Lord Derwentwater had formerly a caftic, now in ruins, intended to prevent the 
** depredations which were frequently committed by the Scots before the union.
We left Kefwick at nine in the morning, and would have proceeded by water, 
“ and fent our horfes over land, but this way of travelling would have coft us more 
** time than we could afford.
On our left, in the way from Kefwick, a ridge of 
“ rude craggy rocks extended near four miles; on our right was Kefwick lake, and 
beyond it a group of pyramidical hills, which formed an uncommon appearance.
“ At the head of Kefwick lake the Derwent is contracted to a narrow river, and 
“ runs between two precipices covered with wood to the top, the perpendicular 
height of which is eight hundred yards.
On approaching this place, we 
“ imagined it to be our n€ plus ultra, but our guide foon convinced us that we 
“ were miftaken.
On the weft fide of the Derwent is this Herculean ftreight ; 
“ and directly under one of thefe ftupendous precipices, lies the village of Grange.
The white prominent rocks, which were difeovered at an immenfe height 
** through the apertures of the w'ood, would have filled a poetical imagination with 
“ the ideas of the Dryades, the Bacchim in remotis, and other fables of antiquity.
“ Here we were obliged many times to alight, the gut being very rocky, and the 
mountains would indeed have been impaffable, if the river had not made a wav.
** We had now reached the Bowders-ftone of Borrorvdale, which is much the 
lai'gcft ftone in England, being at leaft equal in fize to a firft rate man of war ; it 
lies clofe by the road fide, on the right hand, and feems to have been a fragment 
detached from the impending precipice above, by lightning, or feme other acci- 
** dent.
From hence we had good road through groves of hazel, which, in this 
** vale, as there is no occafion for hedges, grow very large, and bear excellent 
*f nuts.
** Before w’e came to Borrowdale chapel, which is fituated on the left, the valley 
** expands, and the two ftreams divide, which form the Derwent by their union.
“ 7be area of Borrovedale chapel is fcarce equal to that of a pigeon-cot, and its height 
nmcb lefs.
We now entered another narrow valley, which winded through 
** mountains that were totally barren, and, in about an hour, we arrived at 
Seathwaite, which is juft under the mines, and, as near as 1 can compute, about 
** ten miles diftant from Kefwick.
The feene that now prefented itfelf, was the 
** moft frightful that can be conceived; we had a mountain to climb for above 
feven hundred yards, in a direeftion fo nearly perpendicular, that we were in 
doubt whether we ftiould attempt it; however, recovering our refolution, we left 
** our horfes at a little houfe that flood by itfelf, on the utmeft verge of the county, 
“ and approached the mountain.
The precipices were fuprifingly variegated wdth 
** apices, prominences, fpouting jets of M-ater, cataradls, and rivers, that were pre- 
cipitated from the cliffs with an alarming noife.
One of thefe rivers we paffed 
over by a wretched foot-bridge, and foon after began to climb; we had not 
*« afeended far, before we perceived fome perfons at a great diftance above us, w'ho 
« feemed to be very bufy, though we could not diftinguifh what they w'ere doing;

“ The black-lead is found in heavy lumps, fome of which arc hard, gritty, and 
of fmall value ; others foft and of a fine texture.
The hill in which it is found, 
“ is a dirty brittle clay, interfperfed with fprings, and in fome places fliivcrs of 
the rock.
The hazel grows in great plenty, from the bottom to the height of 
about three hundred yards ; but all the upper part is utterly barren.
This 
" mineral has not any of the properties of metal, for it will not fufe, but calcines 
“in an intenfe fire: before its value was difeovered, the farmers ufed it, 
“ as thofe of the fouth countries do ruddle, to mark their flieep : it is not the 
“ Vetrolium, the MelaniertUy nor the Pingitis of the ancients ; nor does it agree 
“ with any defeription in Pliny or Aldrovandns.
About an hundred and fifty 
" yards above this rubbifli, is the miner’s lodge, to which the afeent is very fleep; 
“ and here the facts related in the newfpapers muff have happened, if at all ; for 
“ the principal heap of rubbifh, where feveral fellows and girls were then at work, 
is wnthin piffol fhot of the hut.
“ We had now reached the fummit of the black-lead hill ; but were affonifhed 
“ to perceive a large plain to the welt, and from thence another craggy afeent of 
“ five hundred yards, as near as I could guefs.
The whole mountain is called 
“ Unnejierre^ or, as I fuppofe, Finijierre, for fuch it appears to be; myfelf and only 
“ one more of our company determined to climb the fecond precipice, and in 
about another hour we gained the fummit : the feene was terrifying; not an herb 
** was to be feen, but wild favine growing in the interftices of the naked rocks ; the

WAD -MINES, 
The following circumftances, which we gained information of, will conclude the 
account of thefe mines.
They lie on the eaft fide of a very ileep mountain, which 
forms the weft ftde of the vale of Stomethwaite.
— There are two workings; the 
lower one is about three hundred and forty yards above the level of the fea ; the 
upper one about three hundred and ninety: the perpendicular depth of the lower 
is about one hundred and five yards ; and of the upper between twenty and thirty 
yards.
There are no certain marks on the furface, to dired; the miner to the 
mineral.
— The ftrata of the mountains are very irregular and broken ; and the 
black-lead probably was formed in the fiftures of the rocks.
There is no regular 
ftratum of this mineral; it is met with in lumps and irregular maftes.
The 
miners generally work through a quantity of earth mixed with ftones of various 
kinds, then a fpecics of hard grey granite, and after that a dark blue ftone of a 
fofter nature, where they fometimes meet with it.
— Quarts and chryftles are found 
in the workings.
The rock adjoining to this mineral is fometimes tinged as 
black as the mineral itfell, to the depth of two or three feet.
The mines are well 
defended againft pilferers, by a temporary mafon-work and walling within, and a 
houfe over each entrance, which is occupied by the ftewards and workmen.
It 
is ufeful, amongft other purpofes, for fmoothing wood rollers and ferews.
— The 
beft fort is now valued at three guineas a pound.
OSlober^ 1792- The wad-mines were very unfuccefsful for fome few years paft; 
but in the laft year they met with the black-lead again, in a pretty large quantity, 
but of the inferior quality, of which in a fhort time the miners procured about 
five ton.
The mineral is deferibed, as lying in the mine in form refembling 
a tree ; it hath a body or root, and veins or branches fly from it in different direc- 
tions ; the root or body is the fineft black-lead, and the branches at the extremities 
the worft, the further they fly.
The veins or branches fometimes fhoot out to the 
furface of the ground.
It is fometimes found in fops or floats, in a body without 
branches.
A blue rock lies on each ftde of the mineral, and fometimes there is a 
wet Jludge between the rock and the black-lead.
The metal in the low mine lies 
in two veins, one crofting the other , where they crofs is the main body, and the 
beft black-lead ; and thefe veins fall perpendicular for ftxty fathom in depth, the 
blue rock on each ftde ; at the end of ftxty fathom, they found the end of the crofs 
vein, and a large fop of the mineral, which came out as if it had been in a w'rought 
bafon, the form of the black-lead and the rock were fo equal.* 
About five years ago a mine of cobalt was difeovered in the parifh of Crofthwaite, 
near Cowdale ; it lies S.
S. W.
from Kefwick, diftant four miles : it has not yet 
been much attended to; the fpecimens produced do not appear fo rich as that got 
in Germany.
A fpecimen of antimony was lately found near BalTenihwaite ; and at Caldbeck 
manganefe has been difeovered.
“ On the loth of January, 1767, the greateft quantity of fnow fell that was ever 
“ remembered here: it was accompanied with a ftrong wind, and thereby drifted in

“ On the night of the i6th of O^ftober, 1756, there was a heavy gale of wind at 
\V.

It tore up many of the largeft oaks in CroAv-park, and broke the 
trunks of others of a confiderable fize.
Trees of the value of 900I.

turned black, and the blades, as well as the leaves of the trees, tailed ftrong of 
marine falt.”t 
“ Watenlath is that trait of mountainous country which, coming boldly for- 
ward, breaks down abruptly from the fouth upon the vale of Kefwick.
To thofe 
who are accuftomed to mountains, perpendicular motions may be amufing: but 
to thofe whole ideas w’ere lefs elevated, they feeme 4 rather peculiar.
And yet 
there is fomething unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in travel ling a path, w hich 
we were told the w'omen of the country would afeend on horfeback, with their 
panniers of eggs and butter, and return in the night.
After a painful perpendi- 
cular march of near two miles, and many a breathing paufe, which our horfes 
required, we gained the top.
Here we expected to be rewarded by an amufing 
profpccfl: over the neighbouring country; but in this we were difappointed ; we 
found ourfclvcs in the midfi: of a bog, wfith Hill higher grounds around us: fo 
that after all our toil, we had a view only of a vile circumlcribed wafie.
An ealy 
and fitort defeent on the other fi.de of the mountain brought us quickly to 
Watcnlath.
We fell into a piece of fcenei y, w hich, lor beauty and grandeur, 
was equal, if not fuperior, to any thing we had yet feen.
Here w'e found a fmalL 
lake, about two miles in circumference, through which flows the Lodore.
The 
accompanyments of this river, from the lake of Watenlath to its fall, make the 
fjcnery of which we came hither in quefl.
It is a valley fo contracted, that it 
affords room for little more than the river, and a path at the bottom ; while 
the mountains on each fide are fo perpendicular, that their fummits are fcarce 
more afunder than their bafes.
Many mountains we had feen hanging over 
the fides of valleys, but to be immured for almoft the fpace of three miles 
within a chafm of rifted rocks, was a novel circumflance, though we had now 
been two or three days the inhabitants of mountains.
“ When we arrived at the clofe of the valley, the grandeur of the feene increafed.
It opened into an amphitheatre, the area of which, like the valley that led to it, 
was contraCled, fcarce containing the circumference of a mile; but the mountains 
w hich environed it were grand and beautiful.
Here barrennefs was contrafled' 
with all the tint?
of vegetation.
The mountains in front, and on the left, were 
covered w ith wood, which mantled from the top to the bottom.
Thofe on the 
right were barren, yet broken fo varioufly, as even in themfelves to make a con- 
trafi.
At the entrance of the amphitheatre, another bright mountain torrent 
joins the Lodore from the eaff, and forms it into a more confiderable ftream.
With increafed velocity, (the ground growing every ftep more declivous) it now 
pours along with great rapidity ; and throwing itfelf into the thickefl of the

CrolTing the mountains to Dun-mail-raife rtones, by the aflifiance of a fliepherd 
for your guide, is not io w'ild an attempt as the afpedt of the country might feem 
to exprefs ; by this pafs you reach the extreme part of the parilh of Crofthw’aite

peace the northern parts of England.” This cairn conlifts of pebble Hones, to 
the Hdcs of which the wall adjoins which diHinguiflies the boundaries of the 
counties, and confequcntly is conceived to prove its antiquity, as being prior to 
the diviHon of counties : but that appears like begging the queHion, and the argu- 
ment is not very fpecious.
This tumulus or cairn is a few yards to the w eHward 
of the gate which crofles the road ; and by that diredlion may eaHly be found by 
the traveller.
Mr. Gray made his progrefs from Kefwick to Amblefide; but, though his 
deferiptions are retrograde to our movements in this part of the county, yet they 
are applicable in every degree, and of too great value to the reader, to be 
omitted :

The lake looks black from its

We were charmed with the view of Grasmere to the fouth, a retirement fur- 
rounded by hills on every hand.

miles, confifting of meadow and pafture ground ; near the centre is a fine lake,

Mr. Gray’s defcriptlon of this peaceful, happy vale, will raife a with in every reader to fee fo 
primaeval a place : — 
“ The befotn of the mountains, fpreading here and there into a broad bafon, difeover in the midjl Grafmere 
Water , its margin is hollo'wed into fmall bays, nuith eminences ; fome of rock, fome of foft turf, that half 
conceal, and vary the figure of the little lake they command ; from the fhore, a loon promontory pufhes itfelf

inch fares, corn fields, and meadoovs, green as an emerald, onith their trees, and hedges, a'nd cattle fill up 
the --whole f pace from the edge of the ouater : and jujl oppofite to you is a large farm houfe, at the bottom of a 
jieep fmooth lawn, embofomed in old woods, which clinib half-way up the mountains' fides, and difeover above 
a broken line of crags that crown the fcene.
Not a Jingle red tile, nor faring gentleman's hoife, or garden- 
wall, break in upon the repofe of this little unfufpedled paradife; hit all is peace, rujlicity, and happy poverty ^ 
in its neateji, mojl becoming attire." 
“ The broken head of Holme-Crag has a fine effeft, feen from this point.
Defcend the hill, leave 
the church on the right hand, and prefently arrive at the great road to Amblefide or Kefwick ; here 
you have Mr. Gray’s view, and will fee the difference.
Mr. Gray has osnitted the ifiand in his defeription^ 
which is a principal in this fweet fcene.
“ This vale of peace is about four miles in circumference, and guarded at the upper end by Holme- 
Crag, a broken pyramidal mountain, that exhibits an immeiife mafs of antediluvian ruins.
After this 
the road afeends Dunmall- Raife, a heap that has the appearance of a learned barrow ; the wall that 
divides the county croffes them at right angles, which proves their priority of time there.
“ From Dunmall-Raife, the road Is an eafy defeent of nine miles to Kefwick, except Caftle-Crag, that 
Is fomewhat quick.
Leaving the vale of Grafmere behind, you foon come in fight of Leathes Water, 
called alfo Wythburn and Thirlmeer.
It begins at the foot of Helvellyn, and fleirts its bafe for the 
fpace of four miles, increafed by a variety of torrents, that pour down the mountains’ fides.
The range 
of mountains on the right are great, Helvellyn and Catchidecam are the chief ; and, according to the 
Wythburn fhepherds, much higher than Skiddaw.
This is certain, that thefe mountains retain fnow 
many weeks after Skiddaw has loft his winter covering ; but that may be owing to the fteepnefs of 
Skiddaw’s northern fide, and the ftiivery furface, that attradls more forcibly the folar rays, than the 
verdant front of Helvellyn.
The oppofite fhore is beautified with a variety of rocks, fome wooded, 
others net, rifing immediately from the water ; fome rent and hanging forward to the water ; all fet of 
with a back-ground of verdant mountains, rifing in the nobleft ftlle; the whole reflefted from the fbft bofom 
of the lake.
“ At the fixth mlle-poft, from the top of an eminence, on the left, there Is a good general view of the 
lake and vale ; but the moft pifturefque point is from an eminence behind Dalehead houfe.
The lake 
terminates with a pyramidal rock, wooded to the top, and oppofite to it, a grey rock hanging over Its 
bafe towards the lake.
“ The road after this leads through the narrow green vale of Agberthwaite, divided into fmall Inclofures, 
with a few cots, and terminated by the caftle-like rock of St. John.
Below, the vale contrasts Into a 
deep craggy dell, through which Leathes Water rolls till It joins the Greeta at Newbridge, under the 
foot of 'I’hrelkeld fell.
“ The road winds to the left along Thwaltc-Bridge, and afeends Naddle-Fell, by Cawfeyway-Foot, 
to Caftle-Rigg.
At the turn of the hill, and within two miles of Kefwick, you come at once in fight 
of the vale, with all its environs, and inchanting jeenes, which, when Mr. Gray beheld, had almoft deter- 
mined him to return to Kefwick, and repeat his tour.” West’s Guide to the Lakes.

GRANGE.
Near this place, about 1 725, was born the late Rev. Dr.
Tkovias Wren, of Portfmouth; being- the fon 
of Timothy and Judith Wren.
He received his fiift rudiments at Ciofthvvaite, near the place of his birth ; 
from whence he went to St. Bees, and there finifhcd his claflical ftudies.
In 1748, he was fent to 
London ; and entered in a diflenting academy, kept by the Rev. Mr.
David Jennings, and Mr.
(afterwards Dr.) Morton Savage.
Here he remained almoft five years.
His father having died whilft 
he was at St. Bees, and his mother ftill fooner, the care of his education devolved on his elder brother, 
Mr. Timothy Wren: who, marrying and fettling in the north, railed a family, one of whom ftill poffefles 
the eftate at this place, and died in 1780; when his brother erecfed a plain decent ftone to his memory, 
with the following modeft infcription ; 
“ In memory of Timothy Wren of Grange, who departed this life April i8th, 1780, aged 61 : a 
“ fincere Chriftlan !” 
It appears, from fome brief notes of the moft memorable circumftances in his life, written by himfelf,, 
that he was admitted as a minifter, among the old regular Preftryterians, after due examination, in 1735: 
and firft preached ftatedly, as an afiiftant to the Rev. Mr.
Evans of Brentwood, in Eflex, He next 
preached for fome time at Colchefter, and at Difs, in Norfolk ; at which laft place he was preflingly 
iavited to fettle ; but he declined it.
After this he preached occafionally at Hampflead, and at the Old 
Jury, in London ; and in 1757, went to aflift the Rev. Mr.
Norman at Portfmouth, who, dying foun.
after.
Dr. Wren fucceeded him ; and continued there till his death, which took place in 1787.
In the Gentleman’s Magazine for Nov. mber, 1787, there was inferted a well-drawn charaAer of him ; 
which, being of a great length, and very elaborate, we content ourfelves with feletling from it only the 
following particulars.
Of his condiidl it may with the ftrifteft truth be affirmed, that it was highly exemplary.
His, 
knowledge and learning were extenfive ;,and his compofitions ufeful and Interefting., But his mode of 
elelivery, like that of many northern men, was far from being pleafing ; that petty defeft however was 
amply compenfated by many fubftaittial merits, of infinitely greater moment.
In his theological principles 
he was not only orthodox, as thofe of his communion in general are, but candid, charitable, and liberal ; 
living in clofe frlcndlhip w'ith many refpeftable clergy^men of the eftabliftted church.
During the American w^ar, he dillinguiftied himfelf by taking a leading part among thofe who, 
foliclted and (to the great honour of our nation) obtained fubfcrlptions for the relief of the Americam 
prifoners.
His zeal and fuccefs in this matter procured him the notice and regard of Dr. Franklin; and.
alfo the thanks of the congiefs : together with a diploma from the college at Princetown, in New jerfey, 
conferring on him the degree of a Dodlor in Divinity.
Dr. Wren was a truly pious man ; yet remarkable for the opennefs, umeferve, and chearfulnefs of his 
converfation.
He was alfo a man of wit and humour ; and having lived long in a feaport town, he w-as 
remarkable for an happy faculty of imitating the ftile, fentlments, and manners of feafaring men ; whofc 
ftories he often told with great humour, though they never were Interlarded wuth thofe vulgar and Irre- 
Tcrend expreffions fo common among that brave and ufeful fet of men.
Notwithftanding his long refidence In the fouth of England, It. was always his greateft pleafure to make 
occafional excurfions into Borrowdale ; which he never mentioned but w-Ith rapture; nor vlllted but w-ith 
affeftlon.
Nor Is It to be rvondered at, when we confider the ftriking features by which thofe romantic 
regions are diftinguiihed.
At the head of the lake of Derwentwater the Do6lor drew- his firft breath i 
an'ii here he fpent his earlieft days : here he Imbibed thofe fublime ideas, which taught him to defpife 
every narrow and felfifti fentiment ; and to devote his life to urefulnefs and beneficence, as a citizen of 
the w’orld, and a member of the univerfe.
He had fo frequently traverfed the hills and dales of this wild 
dlftrift, that there was hardly a natural curiofity in it, to which he was a ftranger.
No wonder thea 
that, with fuch talents and fuch a temper, his company was eagerly fought after by all thofe who admire

The hills were here and there patched with a few trees, and 
their dope enlivened by flocks of flieep that broufed on each declivity.
This feemed 
to us to be the vale of peace.
Mr. Gray’s defcription of this valley, with that of 
Mr. VAeff, we have thrown into the notes.
About two miles eafl; from Borrow dale, behind Borrowdale fells, lies Wythburn, 
a townfliip and chapelry within this parifh.
It was anciently a manor of the 
Braithwaites of Warcop, until Richard Braithwaite fold it to Sir George Fletcher 
of Hutton-Hall ; and it continues part of the pofleflions of that family.
The 
mountains afford good pafturage for a great number of flieep and cattle.
At 
the foot of Wythburn is Bkackmere, a lake a mile in length, and near half a mile 
in breadth, well ftored with pike, perch, and eels.
From the north end of this

'I'he lad time that ever he was in Cumberland, he was invited to fettle at Kefwick; — a requeft fo 
grateful to his feelings, that he certainly wiihed to comply with it ; but when he mentioned it to his con- 
gregation at Portfmouth, they would not hear of it ; infiftiug, with a moft affedlionate earneftnefs, that 
where he had laboured, there he ihould reft.
And fo it happened.
I'lie Doclor was never married ; and, as he died inteftate, his fortune defeended to his relations in the 
following manner !
One fifth part to his own fifter, Sarah, who married Mr. Daniel Fi earfon of Spark Bridge, in Lanca- 
fliire ; one fifth to the children of his eldeft brother ; to one of whom, viz.
Mr. Bolton Wren of Grange, 
we are Indebted for thefe particulars, and the materials out of which we have formed this account of his 
refpedlable relation : and the other three fifths to a brother and two fifters of the half blood, his father 
having been twice married.
He was interred in the meeting-houfe at Portfmouth ; where, at their own foie expence, his congre- 
gation erefted a very neat monument, with the following infcription :

We paiTed by the iide of the lake of Layfwater; fcattered trees and fome little 
inclofures adorned its margin, and here and there a cottage.
For romantic 
mountains and wild fcenes, this rtage affords the fineft ride in the north of England ; 
the whole road lying in a narrow and winding dell, confined by a ftupendous range 
of mountains on either hand.
In fome places the vale is not wider than merely to 
admit the road, in other places it opens in little amphitheatres, and again is fhut in 
various forms.
As we winded by the feet of thefe lofty hills, creeks filled wdth wood 
here and there afforded beautiful though narrow landfcapes ; through which little 
rivulets, arifing on the fides of the mountains, poured down their hafty and noify 
ffreams.
The rain which had fallen the day before improved the beauties of the 
place ; the cafeades were innumerable, and their figures various ; at one point of 
view we could difeern nine cafeades, falling from eminences which we conceived 
were near a thoufand feet in perpendicular height.
Where fome of them came from 
the very brows of the hills, they appeared like firings of filver; but, advancing 
further, fpread into (beets of foam, and, before they had made half their progrefs 
to the vale, tumbled headlong from precipice to precipice, with a confufed noife.
At the head of Burefdale, fiands an ancient feat of the Laithefes, called Dale- 
head, which gave name to a family of Dales, whofe heirefs married to one 
Laithes, of the parifh of Aikton, and transferred the polfeflion to that race.
— 
Nothing can be more romantic than this place — the little inclofures confifl of rich 
meads and verdant paftures ; the eminences break out into rocks, and are crowned 
with thickets ; whiKt the lofty hills on every fide (hut in the vale, fome rugged

After the heirefs of that houfe

in purfuit of pleafure are not unfortunate, if they fall upon the means of procuring

which will hold a company of eight or ten perfons, with lockers for the carriage 
of provifions, and other neceflaries, for the voyage of the lake, and alfo cannon for 
proving the echoes.* The innkeepers of the neighbouring ftages are not ingenuous 
enough to point out to Grangers this convenience.

Here was bom, in 1662.
Mr. John Hudfin, a very learned critic, and editor of many valuable books.
After having been educated in grammar learning by Mr. Jerom Hechfteller, who lived in the neighbour- 
hood, at the age of fourteen, (1676) was admitted Into Queen’s College, Oxford; where, under Mr.
Thomas Crofthwaite, he made a great progrefs in philofophy, and more efpeclally in polite literature.
— 
Took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in i68t, and that of Mailer in 1684.
Soon after, removed to 
Unlverlity College, of which he was chofen fellow in 1686 ; and became a moll confiderable and elleem- 
cd tutor.
In 1 yci, having accumulated the degrees of Bachelor and DoAor in Divinity, he was defied 
head keeper of the Bodleian Library, in the room of the learned Dr. Thomas Hyde, who had refigned ; 
and with it kept his fellowlhip till 1711, when, according to the llatutes of the college, was obliged to 
refiwn it ; having married Margaret, daughter of Sir Robert Harrifon, Knight, a mercer, and alderman 
c'f the city of Oxford.
In 17 12, he was appointed principal of St. Mary Hall by the chancellor of the 
univerfity, through the intereft and follcitations of the famous Dr. John Ratcliffe.
And to Dr. Hudfon 
is the univerfity of Oxford obliged for the moll ample benefaflions received from Dr. Ratcliffe ; who was 
always expreffing his defigns of doing fomething very great, but undetermined In what way, until his 
lefolutlons were at length fixed by Dr. Hudfon’s advice and perfuafions.
In the mean time our learned 
author obliged the world with curious editions of many of the bell ancient writers.
The lall on which 
he bellowed his learned pains was Jofephus.
He lived to finilh, but not to publilh, it.
It is a neat,, 
beautiful, and valuable edition.
His lludlous and fedentary way of life, with his exceflive abllemioufnefs, 
brought on a bad habit of body ; which terminated In a dropfy, fatal to him in 1719.
He was burled 
in the chancel of St. Mary’s church ; where there Is no monument, or Infcriptlon, to his memory, fave 
as follows, cut upon one of the little fquares of the pavement :

He left one daughter, who married the Rev. Mr.
Boyce, Reftor of Saintbury, In Gloucellerlhire ; 
and his widow married the learned Dr. Anthony Hall.
Such, to the great lofs of literature, was the 
too early end of this truly learned man.
He was in great repute abroad ; having correfponded with 
many of the moll eminent men in foreign parts j and greatly affifted feveral editors in Oxford, particu-

larly Dr. Gregory in his edition of Euclid’s Works ; and the induftrious Thomas Hearne, in his new 
editions of Pliny’s Epiftles, Eutropius, Juftin, and Livy.
The correftnefs of Hearne’s Livy was always 
attributed to Dr. Hudfon’s care and Infpeftion.
But however refpe(^fed, he appears not to have been 
patronized ; and never obtained ecclefiaftical preferment ; which, for the credit of learning and piety, is 
much to be regretted ; and the more fo, as it was known to affeft and mortify our refpeAable country- 
man.
He was a man of great probity ; of a fanguine complexion ; of an handfome and agreeable 
countenance, a moderate ftaturc, and a very good conftitutioH, till he impaired it by inceffant ftudy and 
application.

HARRINGTON.
We arc informed by the ingenious editor of The Nugx jintiqua, that the refpedlable family of 
the Harringtons originally came from this place ; of which they were the barons for many generations.
When, or on what occafion, they removed to Keljlont near Bath, In Somerfetfliire, we have not been able 
to find ;  unlefs It was when Sir James Harrington was attainted in the reign of King Henry VII.
for 
bearing arms at the battle of Towton, and taking Henry VI.
prifoner ; in confequence of which his 
eftates were confifeated, being no lefs than five and injoenty conftderable manors in the north.
Queen 
Elizabeth did one of the family the high honour to Hand godmother to him ; viz.
Sir John Harrington, 
who afterwards became fo diftinguifhed at her court, for his wit and gallantry ; now chiefly known as 
the tranflator of Ariofto’s Orlando Furiofo.
The Indulgence fhewn this author by his royal miftrefs contributed to the number of his writings, as 
well as to their poignancy He was the Martial of his day ; having written and publifhed a book of 
epigrams, W'hich were then much admired, and fiill are thought refpeftable.
His reputation for that 
fpecies of writing, which In that age was not fo common as ii has fince been, foon gained him both love 
and fear.
We are told, that at an ordinary at Bath, where our author was to dine with much campany, 
the fervant maid who attended was obferved to We more particularly attentive to him, than to the reft of 
the guefts } this partiality occafioned an enquiry, why Harrington was to be obferved, and the reft 
neglefted.
To which the fimple damfel replied, to the diverfion of the company, I fear, if I don't ferve 
that gentlemati, he 'will make epigrams on me.
It Is not furprifing that a man of fo volatile a dlfpofitlon and gay turn, amldft the favours of a court, 
and flattery of friends, fhould be profufc in his expences.
Although his fortune was conliderable, (for 
Fuller tells us he was a poet in all things but poverty) yet his extravagance was ftill greater; and he 
was obliged to part with his eftates, particularly one called Nyland, in Somerfetftrire or Dorfetflilre.
— 
Soon alter he was riding over the very fpot, and with his ufual plcafantry, faid to his man John,

Harrington, the author of Oceana and other political works, was of a baronet’s family in Northampton- 
fhlre.
But there is another waiter of this name, of facetious and witty memory, whom, as having clearly 
been a northern man, we cannotbut wifh to confider as of the family of the Harringtons of Harrington.
We mean Drunken Barnaby ; the yet unrivalled author of the Four yourneys to the North of EngLutf—-' 
We colle 61 ; from the following lines in his Itinerary, that his name was Harrington.

He intimates, in varioais paHages, that he was a graduate of Queen’s College, Oxford.
After four 
journeys backwards and forward?, he fays he married and fettled in the country ; turned farmer, and fre- 
quented the fairs as a dealer in horfes and cattle : becoming as eminent for his flcill in horfes, as he bad 
before been for his literature.

It is not cafy to guefs, why the buying and felling of horfes has always been, and (it is to be feared) 
Hill is, conduced with more art, and lefs honour, than any other fpecles of traffic.
With all our modern 
improvements in fineffe and chicane, it is queftionable whether we yet come up to this old trick of putting 
eels into the bellies of horfes, to make them biilker while felling ; if, indeed, the fadl itfelf, as here

He was educated at Queen’s college, Oxford; and became tutor to the Lord Beauchamp, 
only fon of the Earl of Hereford, late Duke of Somerfet ; during which time he adapted Milton’s 
admirable malk of Comus to the ftage, by judicious infertion of feveral fongs and different paffages feledled 
from other of Milton’s works, as well as of feveral fongs and other elegant additions of his own, fuited 
to the chataclers and to the manners of the original author.
During the run of this piece, he induftri- 
oufly fought out a grand-daughter of Milton’s, oppreffed both by age and poverty, and procured her a 
benefit from it, the profits of which amounted to a very confiderable fum.
—He was promoted by the 
king to a prebend of Worcetter, where he died on the 22d day of July, 1763.
Befides the above, he

THE PARISH OF BASSENTHWAITE 
W HICH lies in Allcrdale below Derwent.
— After trefpafTing fo much upon 
the reader in the account given of Kefwick, we will dwell as little as 
poflible on the defeription of the lake of BalTenthwaite, commonly called 
BASSENTHWAITE WATER.
Armathwaite, the houfe of the late Mr. Spedding, is a commodious manfion, 
fronting towards the fouth, and being placed on a conliderable eminence, gradually 
inclining to the lake, commands an exteniive profpedl.
The lake (hews a long 
extended canal in front, not lefs than two miles in view, whofe banks, on the right 
hand fide, arife fwiftly from the water, lifted up in many conical figures, cloathed 
nobly with wood, which gives an indented fhore ; whilft the hills above fw ell into 
Bijpendous heights, fome covered with a fine verdure, and others ihaken, rocky, and 
barren.
The high promontories which margin the lake lie in a beautiful arrange- 
ment and line of pcrfpecfiive on the weftern fide; w'hilfl, on the other hand, the 
cultivated lands, gently defeending from the foot of Skiddaw mountain, border 
the lake with meadows, interfecifed by growing fences, and fcattered over with 
trees and cottages ; fupreme, the barren and fiorm-beaten Skiddaw, blighted and 
torn by the north-w'eft winds, frowns over the verdant valley, and lifts its naked 
brow above the clouds.* 
The ride by the fide of the lake is beautiful, the views arc various : fome con- 
fifi of confined landfcapes, rich, and highly pafioral ; others, which burfl; fucidenly 
upon the fight, are wild, mountainous, and filled with augufi objeels : you fee 
fevcral where wood and water are finely blended, a cultivated ilthmus and a 
cottage; whilft all the back-ground of each landfcape is formed of fiupendous 
heights and hanging cliffs.
The lake is faid to be near five miles in length, and

Went in a chaife along the eaft fide of BaiTenthvvaite to Oufebridge, (pronounced 
Ewfbridge) the road in fome part made and very good ; the reft a flippery, dangerous cart road, or nar- 
row, rugged lanes, but no precipices ; it runs directly along the foot of Skiddaw : oppofite to Widkope 
hronvs cloathed to the top with wood, a very beautiful view opens down to tke Jake, which is narrower 
and larger than that of Kefwick, lefs broken into bays, and without Iflands.
“ At the foot ( f it, a few paces from the brink, gently Hoping upwards, ftands Armathwaite, In a 
thick grove of Scotch fits, commanding a noble view direcily up the lake ; at a fmall di.dance behind tlie 
houfe, is a large extent of wood, and ftill behind this a ridge of cultivated hills, on which, according to 
the Kefwick proverb, the fun always ftilnes.
The Inhabitants here, on the contrary, call the vale of 
Derwentwater the Devil’s Chamber-pot, and pronounce the name of Skiddaw fell, which terminates here, 
with a fort of terror and averfion.
Arrnathv'aite houfe is a modern fabric, not large, and built of dark 
red ftone, belonging to Vr. Spedding, whofe grandfather was fteward to old Sir James Lowther, and 
bought this eftate of the Himers.

houfe wh'ch ftand< here near the bridge, (that crofles the Derwent, juft where it Iffues from the lake)

It is the property of the Earl of Egremont, who has the whole 
fifhery of the lake, fave three draughts, which belong to Mr. Spedding, viz.
at 
Oufebridge, Stone- Wall, and Ellers-Stile.
The Earl has the foie right of navi-

Parties of pleafurc at Kelwick neglect this water, they fcldom think it worth 
while to navigate it; — its beauties indeed are very difl'erent from thofe of the lake 
above; but that is the very caufe from whence they become more pleafing.
To enjoy the fccnes properly, the vibrant fliould navigate thefe lakes al- 
ternately.
This affords many bays, where you may in fome parts pufh 
under the cover of a lofty overhanging grove, and in others rocky coves, where 
you find the gentler echo, favourable to mulic and a fong.
The painter has 
tamper landfcaj^es here, but they are warmer and more ferene than thofe of Kef-

— Soft paftoral feenes margin the lake on the caftern fide, over which 
Skiddaw lifts an augulf brow, to give the boldeff contraft to the green and gently 
riling eminences, the fcattered coppices, the velvet-drefl lawm, the rich verdure of 
the mead, the tranquil cottage, and the ferene and brining mirror which the lake 
expands.

cloathed w ith oaks, at whofc feet a graffy margin lies to the water’s brink, and 
holds fome farmhold; whilb thefublimer mountains, pile upon pile, lift up their 
heads, and, from the weftern fun, cab long fhades upon the lake, whofe diftanc

T “ May 25th.
Continue my journey; pafs along the vale of Kefwick, and keep above Baflenth- 
waite Water, at a fmall cultivated difliance from it: this lake is a fine expanfe of four miles in length, 
bounded on one fide by high hills, wooded in many places to their bottoms; on the other fides by field* 
and the Ikirts of Skiddaw.
“ Marks of the plough appear on the tops of many of the hills.
Tradition fays, that In the selgn of 
King John, the pope curfed all the lower grounds, and thus obliged the Inhabitants to make the bills 
arable ; but I rather believe that John himlelf drove them to this cruel neceffity; for, out of refentment 
of ilicir declining to follow his ftandards to the borders of Scotland, he cut down their hedges, levelled 
ilieir ditches, and gave all the cultivated trails of the north to the beads of chace, on his return from his 
expedition.
“ From Mr. Spedding’s of Armathwaite, at the lower extremity of the lake, have a fine view of the 
whole.
Near this place the Derwent quits the lake, paffing under Ouze-bridge, confifting of three arches.
Salmons come up the river from the fea about Michaelmas; and force their way through both lakes as 
far as Borrowdale.
They had lately been on their return back, but the water near the bridge proving too 
fhallow to permit them to proceed, they were taken by dozens, in very bad order, In the nets that were 
drawing for trout at the end of the lake.

About the bafe of Skiddaw 
the ground is beautiful and fertile ; the land for a confiderable diftance from the lake is level and woody; 
after which it has a few Irr'-gular fwtlls about the new inclofures.
Mirehoufe and Armathwaite are the

cules by ProdlcLis, and the Charailers of Theophraftus, in Greek and Latin, with Notes.
He alfo pub- 
liftied, at the requeft of the vice-chancellor and heads of houfes, a Sermon, to fliew how Religion and 
Learning are mutually fubfervlent to each other; together with other traifrs, without his name.
His edition 
of Epidfetus, See. now lying before us, printed in 1 758, is the fourth.
This proves that it was well received.
Dr. Bolton Siinpfon, late fellow of Queen’s, brother to Jofeph, and who, as well as his brother, had his 
fchool learning at Cockermouth, and principally under that man of extraordinary genius, the late Rev. Mr.
i?//_y^«,v,'asVicar of Milford, Hants : and died five or fix years ago.
He publifhed an edition of Xenophon’s 
Memorabilia, and the Oration of King Agefilaus, together with his Opufcula, in Greek and Latin ; 
together witli Notes, which are learned.
We have heard it aflerted, on authority which cannot well be 
queftioned, that the late excellent fcholar and excellent man, the Rev. Dr.
James, of Arthuret, who was 
then an under graduate of Qiieen’s, gave much material affillance towards rendering this edition fo per-

THE PARISH OF BRIDEKIRK 
(in ALLERDALE ward below DERWENT) 
L ies on the north fide of Derwent, and is defcribed to be bounded by the 
parifli of Ifel from the foot of Redmain Haggs to Ribton beck, where it falls 
into Derwent, and fo up that beck to the north fide of Broughton common unto 
Tallentire hedges, and thence to Gilcruix field j and then eaftward to the hedge 
that divides the Trinities from Bridekirk demefne, till you crofs Cockermouth 
road ; and then down the hedge which divides Woodhall demefne from Woodman 
Haggs, till it reaches to Derwent, where the defeription of this boundary beginneth.
— This parifh is divided into the feveral didric^ts of Tallentire, Appleton, and 
Bridekirk, Dovenby, Broughton, Papcaflle, and Ribton.
Tallentire ftands at the didance of half a mile north-wedward from Bride- 
kirk, an eminence commanding an extendve profpedl over the wedern ocean.
— 
The Solway Frith is in view and the Scotch promontory to the north, compre- 
hending Galloway, Annandale, and a long dretch of the fouthern Scotch counties; 
and, in clear weather, the greated part of the Ide of Mann is plainly to be 
didinguifhed.

PARISH OF BRIDEKIRK..
This was a dependent manor of the barony of Allerdale, and was granted by 
Waldeof, fon of Gofpatrie, to Odard, fon of Lyolph, whofe defcendants took the 
local name of Tallentire.
In later ages it became the property of the Fletchers 
of Cockermouth,* which race terminating in females, it came by marriage of 
Anne, the fecond daughter of Henry Fletcher, to Matthias Partis, of Newcaftle- 
upon Tyne, into that family, and has lately been fold l>y his defcendant.f 
Bridekirk is a Ilraggling village, in which the church (lands.
The church and 
manor belonged to the monaflery of Gyfburn, in Cleveland, by the gift of Waldeof, 
firft Lord of Allerdale ;|1 which grant was confirmed, and the church was made 
appropriate by Bifhop Irton.
After the didblution, three divifions took place.
King Henry VIII.
in the 35th year of his reign, granted the manor to one Tolfon, 
to be held in capite by the twentieth part of a knight’s fee, and 26s, rent.§§ — 
Queen Mary, in the 2d year of her reign, granted the advowfon and right of 
patronage of the church and vicarage to Catton and Manne, Londoners, to hold 
of the inanor of Eaft Green wich.§ The Whartons had the great tithes and 
rebtorial rights, as it (eems, by demife; but when they were granted to them we 
have gained no evidence : but King James I.
in the 2d year of his reign,;]; granted 
out the fee to Gillet and Blake of the tithe of corn and grain of the two Broughtons 
and Papcaftle diftridls.^

11 He gave Appleton and Bridekirk, with the patronage of the church of Bridekirk, which was con- 
firmed by two feveral charters by Alan his fon, and by Alice de Romley, for the health of her foul, and 
the fouls of her father and mother, and all her anceftors and fuccelTors, and her hulbands, Gilbert Pypard 
and Robert de Courtney.

^ Here was born Sir J'ifcph 1 Villia??jfotj, a perfon of great eminence in the laft century.
He was the 
fon of the Rev. Jofeph Williamfon, who was inftituted into this vicarage in 1625 : but of the date of.
Sir Jofeph’s birth we have not been abla to procure any notice.
He is faid, at his firft fetting out in 
life, to have been clerk and amanuenfis to Richard Tolfon, Efq. reprefentative in parliament for Cocker- 
mouth.
Being in London with Mr. Tolfon, he, through his intereft, was admitted into Weftminfter 
fchool ; where, being of a quick apprehenfion and unwearied diligence, he foon made fuch a proficiency, 
that his matter, the great Dr. Bujby, recommended him, as a northern youth deferving, as well as wanting, 
patronage, to the Rev. and learned Dr. Langbaine, provoft of Queen’s College, Oxford ; where he was 
admitted on the foundation.
In the Phoenix Bnttannicus,\'fe find a fhort copy of verfes by him, in French, on an extraordinary occafion, 
which feems to have called forth the contributions of all the moft diftinguifhed wits of the univerfity.
One Anne Green was, in 1650, actually executed at Oxford for the muiderof a baftard child ; proteft- .
Ing her innocence with her latett breath.
She was fufpended for almott half an hour : fome of her friends 
in the mean time ufing force in various ways the fooner to difpatch her out of her pain ; until the under- 
Iheriff, fearing left they (hould break the rope, forbade them to do fo any longer.
At length, when every 
one thought Ihe was dead, the body being taken down and put into a co£n, was carried thence into a 
private 
PARISH OF BRIDEKIRK.
245 
The church is a plain and humble firudlure, and doth not feem entitled to the 
famous piece of antiquity it holds, either as being the feat of the tranfadlion 
recorded thereby, or othe'rwife.
It has been treated on by many writers; and as 
our purpole has been throughout this work, to colled into one view all that has 
been 
private lioufe, where feme phyficians had appointed to make a difledlion.
The cofhn being opened, fhe 
was obferved to breathe : which being perceived by a luily fellow who Hood by, lie (thinking to do an 
att of charity, in ridding her of the fmall reliques of a painful life) ftamped feveral times upon herbreaft 
and Itomach with all his force.
At length the phyficians, among whom were Dr. Petty and Dr. Willis, 
began to attempt her recovery ; and fucceeded.
The llory is mentioned as undoubtedly authentic by 
Dr. Plot in his Natural Hiftory of Oxfordflrire ; and alfo by Dr. Derham in his Phyfico Theology.
— 
But this Ihort account of it is extrafted from a pamphlet, preferred in the Pheenix Brittanvkus, v.-ritten 
by a J'cholar in Oxford; entitled “ News from the Dead ; or a true and exadl; Narrative of the miraculous 
“ Deliverance of Anne Green in which there are many curious particulars, as to her account of her 
fenfations, &c.
on her execution, and the means employed for her recovery.
No lefs than thirty-three 
copies of verfes, in Latin and Englilh, all of them curious, and many full of wit, are annexed to it : our 
countryman’s is as follows :

Jos. Williamson, du Coll, de la Reyne.
On his taking his bachelor’s degree.
Dr. Langbalne recommended him to a perfon of quality atf 
travelling tutor ; whom he accompanied on a tour into France.
When he returned, he was elefted 
fellow of Queen’s ; and.
It has been faid, admitted into deacon’s orders.
Soon after the reftoration of 
King Charles II.
he was recommended to the then fecretary of Hate, who placed him in the paper office, 
ai Cu.llos Archivorum, and made frequent ufe of him in interpreting and writing letters and memorials in 
French.
In 1674, his name appears In the catalogue of Oxford graduates, as created D.
C. L.
: and 
foon after, he was advanced to the place of Secretary of State, in the place of the Earl of Arlington ; 
he having before been plenipotentiary at the congrefs of Cologne : then alfo he had the honour of 
knighthood conferred upon him.
In 1678, on a complaint from the commons, that commiffions had 
been granted to popiffi recufants, and warrants for muftering them counter-figned by Sir Jofeph, he was 
fent to the Tower.
This much offended the king ; who the next day fent for the commons to attend 
him in the Banqueting Houfe, Whitehall : where he.
In a fpecch, told them plainly, that though they 
had committed his feivant, without acquainting him ; yet he intended to deal more freely with them, and 
acquaint them with his intention to releafe his fecretary : which accordingly he did that very day.
In 
J678, immediately after the prorogation of the parliament, he refigne^the feals into the hands of the 
king, w’l o appointed the Earl of Sunderland In his room ; though he had given hopes of the place to 
Sir William Temple, then ambaffador in Holland, and had called him over for that purpofe.
But Sir 
William, on his arrival, found the port filled ; the Earl of Sunderland having paid Sir Jofeph Wllliamfon 
fix thoufand pounds and five hundred guineas, which Temple w’as not able or willing to give.
At the treaty of Nimeguen in 1 679, he was one of the plenipotentiaries, on the part of the King of 
Great Britain ; and had the like charadter at the pacification concluded at Ryfwick in 1696.
fie appears to have been particularly attentive and friendly to his countrymen.
The learned and 
avcompliihed Dr. Lancafter, provoll of Queen’s, was early in life fent abroad, by the order and at the 
txpence of King Charles 11 .
on the advice and recommendation of Sir Jofeph Willlamfon ; as Biffiop 
Nicolfon alfo was.
This was done, in confequence of a very fenfible plan, formed by Sir Jofeph, to fend 
foine young gentlemen of parts and abilities to the courts of France, Germany, See. in order to qualify 
them

been faid on the important fubjcdls of antiquity which occurred, and then humbly 
to fubmit our ideas, we fhall here purfue the fame plan.
In the edition of Camden, to which we have hitherto conftantly attended, it is 
thus mentioned, fpeaking of Papcaftle — “ Here, among other monuments of anti- 
quiry, was found a large open vcfTel of greenifli (lone, with little images curioufly 
" engraved upon it : which, whether it was an ewer to wafli in, or a font, called bv 
“ Sf.
them for the minifterial offices abroad.
King George I.
by the advice of Lord Townfend, then Secretary 
of State, refumed and extended the plan, by founding a profefforfliip of modern languages in each univer- 
fity, to inftrudl young iludents there with the fame view.
Sir Jofeph alfo took with him, when he went to Ryfwick, his godfon, Dr. Jofeph Smith, afterwards 
provoft of Queen’s : and, on their paffage, there happened a violent ftorm, which put them in imminent 
danger of their lives.
He alfo accompanied him into Holland : where, being feized with a dangerous fit 
of the gout, he called Smith to his bedfide, and defired him to go to his bureau, and take out his will.
Upon fome flight (hewn by his college.
Sir Jofeph, then making his will, had given but little to his alma 
mater : the benefaftion which he had intended for Oxford, he bequeathed to the building and endow- 
ing a college at Dublin, by the name of Q_ueen’s college ; the provofts whereof were to be chofen from 
Queen’s college, Oxford.
From this purpofe, his godfon had the good fortune to divert him ; and 
accordingly Sir Jofeph, on the will’s being brought to him, whifpered Smith in the ear to make an 
alteration in it in favour of his own college.
All was done, and ready to be executed, when the matter 
•was in fome danger of a mifcarriage, by the coming in of Sir Jofeph’s lady, before the paper had been 
read to him.
Dr. Smith, well knowing that Sir Jofeph had no mind his lady (hould be acquainted with 
the affair, endeavoured to conceal it : which (he perceiving, faid brifltly, — Mr. Smith, what have you 
got there?
To wffiich he readily replied, — Nothing but news, Madam ; meaning fuch news as die wa* 
not to know.
By this feafonable and ready turn, (he was put off from making any further cnq;iiries.
This lady  rvas the widow of Henry Lord O’Brien ; and Ii(b r and foie heir to Charles Duke of 
Richmond.
Hence, (he brought Sir Jofeph large poffeffions in Kent and elfevvhere ; bcfides the heiedl- 
tary (lewardflrlp of Gravefend.
In his life-time, and at his death he gave to Qiieen’s college, In plate, books, building, and money to 
the value of 8oocl.
His donation of books to the Illnary at St. Bees was not Inconfiderable.
To the 
grand children of his patron.
Dr. Langbaine, he left 500I.
And he fent to this j)ari(li of Bridekirk gilt 
Bibles and Prayer-Books, velvet covering and rich linen for the altar, with (liver flagon.s and chalices for 
the adminiffration of the holy cominunion.
In the library of Qiie n’s college, Oxford, Is a Latin poem, of nearly five hundred lines, celebrating 
this benefacllon of Sir Jofeph Wllliamfon to the college.
The title is, “ In Legationem et Ampliflima 
“ Merita Excellentix fuse jampridem ter honorabllls Josephi Williamson, Agri Cumbrlcnfls, Equitls, 
“ Aurati, Carmen Gratulatorlum.” 
The author has annexed to his w-ork only the initials of his name ; hut he Is now known to have been 
Payne Fiflrei ; whom Sir Jofeph is faid to have liberated from prifon.
He was of Chriff Clnirch; and, from 
the exprefilon mjler A'jcr Southantonierjti, It may be inferred, that he  v.-as born in Hampfhire.
He wrote 
fcveral other heroic poems, calls them ; and amongft them Is one entitled Marjfon Mocr, in fix 
bocks.
Prefixed to this poem on Sir Jofeph Williamfon is a copy of verfes in praifeof the poet, by one 
Gullelmus Ferrarius, Aulse quondam Clarenlis Cantab.
We will tranferibe, for the amufement of the 
curious, a few of the lines of this Culiclmus Ferrailus to his friend, whom he calls Pifeator — 
Non equidtm invidec, fed magnis gratulor aufis, 
Et Cseptis applaudo tuis, quod inania fpernens

/t/ice Hall, wife of Ifaac Hall, of Little Broughton, was early favoured with divine vifttatlons ; and, 
being obedient thereto, grew in religious experience, and received a gift In the miniftry.
In her unmarried 
ftatc, (he was concenied to vifit friends twice in Ireland and moil parts of England and Wales, and once 
In Scotland.
After her marriage in 1743, ftie remained zealous for the caufe of truth, and was oftea 
concerned to travel in the fervice thereof, vlfiting feveral parts of her native land, and Ireland a third 
time.
In the year 1760, ftie found an engagement to vifit the churches in America, which proved a very 
clofe trial in parting from her hufband and children ; and her labours of love through the different pro- 
vinces w'ere to the general fatisfadlion of friends, as appeared by divers certificates tranfmitted from thence.
In the courfe of her vifit file w'as an example of great patience and humility, difeharging her duty faith- 
fully in her weighty undertaking ; from which vifit ftie was not permitted to return, but died at Phila- 
delphia in .1762.
Slie endured her illnefs, which was very fiiarp, without any figns of murmuring ; but, 
in lamb-like patience, expreffed an entire refignation to the divine will, whether to live or die.
Thomas Tickell, Efq. an eminent poet and ftatefman, was born here in 1686 ; being the fon of the 
Rev. Richard Tickell, V’icar of Bridekirk.
He was fent to Queen’s college, Oxford ; where he took 
his mafter’s degree In 1 708.
In two years after, he was chofen fellow ; for which, as he did not comply 
with the ftatutes, by taking orders, he obtained a dlfpenfation from the crown.
In 1726, he married 
at Dublin ; when he vacated his fellowfiiip.
Tickell, fays Dr. Johnfon, was not one of thofe fcholars, who wear away their lives In clofets — He 
entered early into the world ; and was long bufy In public affairs ; in which he was initiated under the 
celebrated Mr. Secretary Addifon ; not folely, becaufe, as Dr. Johnfon fuppofes, he had writtten a very 
elegant copy of verfes on Addlfon’s Rofamond, but alfo becaufe, if a family tradition may be credited, 
there had been a connexion between their families.
There was moreover a ftriking congeniality of man- 
ners, temper, talents, and principles between them.
Addifon was modeft and mild, a fcholar, a gentleman, 
a poet, and a Chriftian.; and fo was Tickell : Addifon alfo was a Whig, and Tickell, as Swift ufed to

call him, Whiggifimuu Tlckell is the author of a fmall volume of poems, publiflicd in Dr. Johnfon’s 
Colle£lIon of the Works of the Englifh Poets : and it is no ordinary honour to him, that Dr. Johnfon 
(not apt to be laviflr of panegyric) allows him to deferve an high place among the minor poets.
This, 
furely, is no very liberal allowance to one who, when he tranflated the firll book of the Iliad, excited the 
jealoufy of Mr. Pope to fuch a degree, that.
In paffion and pique, he afcribed it to Addiion: in this 
opinion Pope perfiflcd as long as he lived ; but it Is now known to have indifputably been Mr. Tickell’a.
It was this adventrous attempt, and this mhlaken notion as to Its author, which provoked Pope, fo 
imgeneioufiy as well as iinjultly, to publhh thofe lines againft Addifon, after Addifon was dead, dif* 
tInguiflreJ at once for unequalled elegance and malevolence, in his EpiMc to Arbuthnot.
“ To compare the two tranflations, fays Johnfon, would be tedious : the palm is now given univerfally 
“ to Pope : but I think the firil lines of Tickell’s were rather to be preferred ; and Pope feems fince to 
“ have borrowed fomething from them in the correflion of his own.” 
There is not in the whole compafs of Englifli literature a more fublime or elegant funeral poem, than 
Tickell’s Elegy on the Death of Addifon., The lines in the 3d and 4th paragraphs are particularly noble : 
“ Oft let me range the gloomy alfles alone, 
“ Sad luxury !
to vulgar minds unknown, 
“ Along the walls, vvhere fpeaking marbles fliew 
What worthies from the hallow’d mould below ; 
“ Proud names, who once the reins of empire held ; 
“ In arras who triumph’d ; or in aits excell’d ; 
“ Chiefs, grac’d with fears, and prodigal of blood ; 
“ Stern patriots, who for facred freedom flood ; 
“ Juft men, by whom impartial laws were given.
And faints who taught and led the way to heav’n: 
“ Ne’er to thefc chambers, where the mighty reft, 
“ Since their foundit’on, came a nobler guell ; 
*• Nor e’er was to the bowers of bllfs convey’d 
“ A fairer fpirit, or mere welcome fiiade.
“ In what new region, to the juft afiign’d 
“ What new employments pleafe th’unbody’d mind; 
“ A winged virtue through th’ ethereal flcy, 
“ From world to world unwearj’d does he fly ?
“ Or curious trace the long laborious maze

“ Does he delight to hear bold feraphs tell 
“ How Michael battled, and the dragon fell ; 
“ Or, mix’d with milder cherubim, to glow

“In fllent whifperings purer thoughts impart, 
“ And turn from ill, a frail and feeble heart ; 
“ Lead through the paths thy virtue trod before, 
“ Till bllfs flrall join, nor death can part us more.” 
When Mr. Addifon went into Ireland, as Secretary to the Lord Sunderland, he took Mr. Tickell 
with him, and employed him in public bufinefs : and afterwards becoming Secretai'y of State, Mr.
Tickell was made his Under-fccrctary.
On the death of Addifon, Tickell gave an handfome and com- 
plete edition of his works, by Adilifon’s particular defire.
In 1 734 he was made Secretary to the Lords 
Juft'ces of Ireland : his brother, Richard "I'ickell, Ei''q.
having been appointed Secretary at Wa.r in that 
kingdom, at the fame time.
This fecretaryfhip he held till the 23d of April, 1740, when he died at 
Bath.
We have not been able to learn what family he left, if any ; his widow, we have bear'd, was living 
not many years ago.
Richard Tickell, Efq. a commiflioner of the ftamps, and author of the humor-

The reft in fhape, not in power, come nearefl: to thofe upon the tomb of Gormon 
the Danifh king, at fettling in Denmark, which Petrus Lindebergius publifhed 
in the year 1591.
Upon the latter view* of this, it feems very plain that the 
figures are no other than the pidluies of Sr. John Baptilf, and our Saviour 
“ baptized by him in the river Jordan: the defeent of the Holy Ghcft in the fliape 
“ of a dove is very plain ; and as to the infeription, it has been in great mealurc 
cleared by the learned Bifhop Nicolfon in the following letter, feat many years 
“ fince to Sir William Dugdale: — 
Honoured Sir, CarUJlc, Ncv. 23, i6§5.
" My worthy and good lord, our bifliop, was lately plcafed to 
“ acquaint me, that you w'ere delirous to have my thoughts of the infciiption on 
“ the font at Bridekirk, in this county.
I am.
Sir, extremely confeious of the 
“ ralhnefs of bringing any thing of mine to the view of fo difeerning an antiquary ; 
bur, withal, very tender of difobeying fo great and worthy a perfon.
1 know 
“ you were plcafed to make your own obfervations upon it, in your vifitation of 
“ thefe parts, when Norroy : and I fliall hope, that you will give me an opportu* 
nity of rectifying by yours my following conjedtures : — 
1. “ The fabric of this monument does, I think, fairly enough evince, that it is 
“ Chriftian ; and that it is now ufed to the fame purpofe for which it w'as defigned.’ 
“ Mr. Camden, though not acquainted with the charad;crs of this infeription, yet 
feems to fancy thus much; and, for proof of his opinion, brings a notable quotation 
" out of St. Paulinus’s Epiftles.
But he need not have fent fo far off for a voucher; 
” if he had taken notice of the imagery on the eafl fide of the ftone ; as 1 doubt 
not.
Sir, but you have done.
We have there fairly reprefented a perfun in a 
long faccrdotal habit dipping a child into the water; and a dove, the emblem 
“ no doubt of the Holy Ghofl, hovering over the infant.
Now, Sir, I need not 
” acquaint you, that the facrament of baptifm was anciently adminilfered by 
plunging into the water, in the wefeern as well as eaflern parts of the church; 
“ and that the Gothic word Daupjan, the German word Dauffen^ the Danifh D?>ve, 
“ and the Belgic Doopen, do as clearly make out the pradfice as the Greek word 
“ nor, that they may all feem to be derived from another word of the 
“ fame language and fignification, and are evidently akin to the Englifli Dip^ 
Deepy and Depth.
Indeed our Saxon anceflors expreffed the adlion of baptifm 
“ by a word of a different import from the reff.
For in the forementioned place 
“ of St. Mark’s gofpel,* their tranflation has the text thus : ic.
eo]) pulllge on pastepe, 
he eop pulla^s on palgum japre, i, e.
Ego VOS aquis baptizo ; ille VOS fpiritu fandlo 
“ baptizabit.
Where the word pullian or puUIgean fignifies only lavare : whence the 
" Latin word fullo and om fuller have their original.
But to conclude from hence, 
that the Saxons did not ufe dipping in the facrament of baptifm, is fomewhat 
“ too harfh an argument.
2. “ There are other draughts on the north and vveff fides of the font, which 
" may very probably make for our purpofe : but with thefe, as not thoroughly 
underftanding them, and having not had an opportunity of getting them drawn 
“ on paper, I fliall not trouble you a: prefent.

3. “ On the fouth fide of the ftone we have the infcriplion which I have taken 
“ care accurately to write out, and it is as follows ; 
Now thefe kind of characters are well enough known, iince Ol. Wormius’s great 
induftry in making us acquainted with the Literatura Runica, to have been 
“ chiefly ufed by the Pagan inhabitants of Denmark, Sweden, and the other 
“ northern kingdoms ; and the Danes are faid to have fwarmed moftly in thefe 
parts of our ifland.
Which two confiderations feem weighty enough to per- 
“ fuade any man at firfl: fight, to conclude that the font is a Danifh monument.
But then on the other hand, we are fufficiently affured, that the Heathen Saxons 
did alfo make ufe of thefe Runae; as is plainly evident from the frequent mention 
of Run cpasprijen and Riuij’raj'ap in many of the monuments of that nation, both in 
print and manufeript, ftill to be met with.
Befides, we muff not forget that both 
Danes and Saxons are indebted to this kingdom for their Chriflianity : and, there- 
fore, thus far their pretenfions to a Runic, Chriflian monument, may be thought 
equal.
Indeed, fome of the letters, as D, S, and q, feem purely Saxon, being not 
to be met with among Wormius’s many alphabets : and the words themfelves, 
“ if I miflake them not* come nearer to the ancient Saxon dialed than the Danifli.
“ Thus, therefore, I have ventured to read and explain it : — Er FAard ban men 
" egrodlen, and to dis men red zver Taner men brogten : i.
e. Here Ekard zvas converted ; 
** and to this man’s example zssere the Danes brought.
There are only two things in 
the inferption, thus interpreted,, that will need an explanation 
1. “ Who this Ekard was } And this is indeed a queflion of that difficulty, that.
I am I confefs not able exaClly to anfwer it.
The proper name itfeJf is ordinary 
enough in the northren hiflories, though varioufly written; as Echardus, 
Echinardus, Eginardus, Ecardus, and Eckhardus, It is certainly a name of 
«* valour, as all others of the like termination; fuch as Bernhard, Everhard,Gothard, 
Reinhard, &:c.
fo that it may well become a general or other great officer in- 
“ the Danifh army : and fuch we have jufl reafon to believe him to have been, 
“ who is heredrawn into an example for the reft of his countrymen.
Our hiftorians 
« are not very particular in their accounts of the feveral incurfions and victories 
“ of the Danes ; and their owm writers are much more imperfeCt ; and, therefore,, 
in cafes of this nature, we muft content ourfelves with probable conjeClures.
2. “ Han men egrodlen^ w hich, rendered verbatim, is, Have men turned, i.
e. rvas' 
turned : — a phrafe to this day very familiar in mofl: dialeCls of the ancient Celtic 
tongue, though loft in our Englifh.
In the High Dutch it is efpecially obvious ,- 
as man fagely man hat gejagty man lobety &c.
and the French imperfonals on dity 
** on faity &c.
are of the fame ftrain ; and evident arguments that the Teutonic 
and Gaulifh languages were anciently near of kin.
The characters ^/^and 
are manifeftly abbreviations of feveral letters into one; of which fort we have- 
great variety of examples in feveral of Wormius’s books : and fuch I take the 
letter D to be, inftead of J and J^'; and not the Saxon D.

rowed from the Saxons ; and 3 1 take to be a corruption of their p or UJ.

mixture of the Danifh and Saxon tangucs; but that can be no other than 
** the natural effed: of the two nations being jumbled together in this part of the 
world.
Our borderers to this day fpeak a leaih of languages, Britilb, Saxon, 
“ and Danifh, in one : and it is hard to determine which of thofe three nations has 
“ the greateft fhare in the motley breed.” 
Bifhop Nicolfon, on his parochial viiitation in 1703, fays — “ I took fome pains 
** in reviewing the Runic infeription on the font in this church, fome account 
“ whereof I had long fince given to Sir William Dugdale, publilhed in the 
Philofophical Tranfaedions ; I found it in fome little particulars different from 
“ what 1 had at firft obferved it to be.”

" The drawings I now fubmit to your infpeedion, reprefent the different fides 
** of the famous fquare font, or baptiflery, at Bridekirk, in Cumberland, together 
** with the Runic infeription on the fouth fide of it.
What authority Camden had for afferting that it was found at Papcaftle, docs 
" not appear ; and indeed I much doubt the fadl; for there is not the leafl tradi- 
" tion, or are there are any figns of there ever having been a church or chapel at 
** Papcaflle; but there are evident marks, by the fculpture which appears on this 
“ veffcl, not to m.ention the infeription, that it was a font ab origine ; for, as the 
” annotator on Camden juftly obferves, “ The figures are no other than the 
^ piffures of St. John the Baptift, and our Saviour baptized by him in the river 
“ Jordan ; the defeent of the Holy Ghofl in the fhape of a dove being alfo very 
” plain.” 
“ On the whole, Dr. Nicolfon concludes, that the infeription is Danifh.
Now, 
“ though 1 entirely agree with him in this point, 1 ftrongly fufpedt, that the font is 
•* of higher antiquity ; and that the infeription was added on a memorable event, 
“ about the beginning of the eleventh century, under the Danifh government.
The 
** infeription informs us, that here Ekard, probably a Danifh general, as Bifhop 
** Nicolfon on good grounds fuppofes, received baptifm on his converfion to 
" Chriftianity, an example then followed by feveral of his countrymen at this place.
It is not likely that the font was made on that particular occafion, for every mother 
** church had a font on its eretffion ; but it is very likely that the baptifm of fo 
confiderable a perfon, accompanied by that of feveral of his followers, Biould be 
** recorded by an infeription on the font at which they received their baptifm.”

Extras of a Letter from the Rev. John Bell, Vicar of Bridekirk, who coinmunicaied 
Draughts of this Font, dated iith Dec. 1767.
The drawings of the fouth and north fides of this font were made this year 
" by one Ainfley, apprentice to Mr. Jefferies; the other two fides by Mr. Elliot, 
“ employed by Jefferies to furvey the c ounty.
The figures on the eafl: fide are 
probably enough fuppofed to reprefent the baptifm of Chrift, who flands on a 
** kind of font or vafe, with a nimbus, almoff defaced, round his head, and over 
“ him a dove, whofe head is alfo imperfedl.
On the north fide is a relief of the 
** angel driving Adam and Eve out of paradife; Eve clinging round the trees fhews 
an unvvillingnels to depart, The weft fide, contrary to the affertion of the 
" Magazine writer, who is fuppofed to be one Mr. Smith, of VVigton, is the mofl 
complete.” 
The treatife mentioned to be publiflied in the Gentleman’s Mag.
(May 1749) 
is as follows : — deferibing the font, the writer fays — 
“ It is a whitifh freeftone, and ftands in a fquare pedeftal about eight inches high 
** in the upright, and about three more in the perpendicular of the Hope; this fup- 
ports another of about twenty inches, and over all this is the font, about twenty 
inches more, pretty near a cube hollowed, being twenty-two inches on the fouth 
and north fides, and twenty inches on the other two.
It faces the porch door of 
“ Bridekirk, is lined with lead, and perforated at bottom, to take off ihe baptifmal 
water, and muff be at leaft nine hundred years flanding.
The front, or fouth fide engraving, is betwixt three fillets, the uppermofi I 
imagine contains the ^Egoceri, or fea-goat, the ancient reprefentation of Capri- 
** corn, in whofe fign the fun was at the birth of Chrift, and probably alludes to 
“ that : the middle filler has a feftoon of grapes, &c.
and a human figure catching 
at a clufter, to intimate the myftery of the paflion, or of the Eucharift, and the 
“ advantages accruing to the partaker.
Betv.'ixt that and the third fillet is the 
“ infeription : and below, a female figure with a cup, probably in her hand, and 
feme feftoons.
“ The eaft fide has two fillets ; the uppermoft contains an amphifbuna, or a 
*' hydra rather, with two heads, one bent down over its body to the ground, the 
other eredt, with a branch proceeding from its mouth, which in its procefs divides 
into three ; the firft head may denote the deprefiion and cxtindlion of the 
Chriftian one ; and the myftery of the Trinity may be expreffed in the branch 
“ dividing into three, and both may be reprefented by the hydra, The lecond 
" fillet has a tree, and Jofeph and Mary I fuppofe with the child; as Jofeph is 
called a fruitful branch.
“ The north fide confirms my conjedlure on that of the fouth, where the two 
“ celeftial figns of Capricorn and Sigittary are reprefented ; Sigittary is the con- 
“ eluding fign of the year, as Capricorn the initial one, with regard to the folar 
** return ; intimating, that the religion which fprung from the perfon born when 
“ the fun was in Capricorn, would continue to the confummation of things, or till 
“ the fun had gone into Sagittary, their emblem for the laft period.
The fillet 
below, on the fame fide, has an allufion to the daughter of the babes at Bethlehem,

" and a devotee in a religious pofiure, kneeling and taking hold of the true tree of 
** life, notwithftanding the lofs of her child, as the only means of her future 
" acceptance and happlncfs.
The well fide is in the fame taffe, but the figures 
are walled by time.” Such is the defeription by the Magazine writer.
The ingenious traveller, Mr. Pennant, vifited this place, and gives a fliort 
defeription of this piece of antiquity ; fomc of his remarks ferve to confirm our 
drawings, and confound Mr. Smith’s defeription : he fays — “ On each fide are 
“ difi'erent fculptures ; on one a crofs, on another a two-headed monfier, Sec.
; on 
a third fide is a fort of centaur, attacked by a bird and fom.e animal, and under 
** them the angel driving our firfi father out of Eden, while Eve clings dole to the 
“ tree of life, as if exclaiming, 
“ Oh unexpeded fl roke, worfe than of death ; 
“ Mufi: I then leave thee, paradife ?
thus leave 
“ Thee, native foil.” 
“ And on the fourth fide two birds, with fome ornaments and figures beneath; and 
*' the infeription, &:c.” 
Nicolfon and Burn fay — Mr. Bell, the prefent learned and very worthy in- 
cumbent, obferves, that the figures in the fecond fillet on the eaft fide, which Mr.
“ Smith fuppofes to be Jofeph and Mary, feem evidently to be John baptizing our 
Saviour; for there is the image of a dove, whofe wing is over the head of the 
“ perfon iuppofed to be baptized, W'ho fiandeth in a fort of baptifteryj but the 
head of the dove is obliterated.” — They add — “ Dr. Hicks, in a letter to Bifliop 
“ Nicolfon, fpeaking of this infeription, fays, it Teems to be Dano-Saxonic, and by 
confequence neither good Danifh nor good Saxon ; and, after feveral attempts 
“ to explain it, he is forced to leave it in the dark.” 
Mr. Gough, in his edition of Camden, fays the font fionc " exhibits, in rude 
“ relief, the expulfion of Adam and Eve out of paradife, and the baptifm of Chrift; 
“ over which may perhaps be the ferpent with the forbidden fruit.
“ As to the conftru(ftion given by Bifiiop Nicolfon of the infeription, he fays, — 
“ Wormius gave a very different explanation in a letter to Spelman, (1634) 
“ Horaldus cimulnm fecit, et lapidcs ersxit in memoriam malris et mahroki, which 
” gives the letters from Canrden’s copy fo different from Bifliop Nicolfon, that 
“ one would doubt if they had ever been truly copied.
Camden’s letters are cer- 
" tainly incorrect, and Wormius had no other copy; whereas Bifliop Nicolfon 
“ profeffes to have written them out from the fionc.
Dr. Hicks, in a letter to 
Bifiiop Nicolfon, fays the letters feem to be Dario-Saxonic, confequently neither 
“ good Danilh nor good Saxon.
On comparing the three copies by Camden, 
“ Wormius, and Nicolfon, it appears that Camden gives thirty-fix, (charaefters) 
Nicolfon thirty-four, omitting the thirtieth and thirty-firft, (which, in the 
Archaeologia copy by Mr. Ainfiey, arc fupplied like Camden’s) and Wormius 
“ thirty-feven, near half of which bear no refemblance to the others.” 
The annexed is an accurate engraving of this celebrated piece of antiquity, 
from a drawing taken by a gentleman, whofe name, were we permitted to infert

it, would do credit to our work.
The accounts which we have prefented to the 
reader, do not in many inftances agree with truth.
The upper figures on the 
fouth fide, which Mr. Smith fays are y^igroceri, or fea-goats, are evidently birds, 
and, we conceive, reprefent the Danifli ftandard, the raven.
— The other figures are 
merely ornamental, with feftoons of grapes : the lowefi figure weilds a mallet, and 
is in the attitude of a fculptor at work.
How Mr. Smith could imagine hydras 
and Jofeph and Mary on the eaft front, we cannot conceive.
The figures are bold, 
diftindl, and intelligible.
— John the Baptifl is there moft affuredly reprefented ; 
his garment is cut fhaggy and rough, to intimate his coat of camel’s hair : the 
figure emerfing in the font has a nimbus ; over him a bird is feen in a fufpended 
pofture.
— The figures on the north front are as ftrangely defcribed : the fculpturc 
here is fingularly beautiful : the folds and falling of the garments are excellent.
— 
The chief figure reprefents the great perfonage whofe converfion we prefume this 
monument records ; the fword imports the dignity of his fiation.
— The next 
figure is turned towards him in a teaching attitude, dreft like a pilgrim, with a 
ftaff, barefooted, and in fhort garments reaching to the knee only ; with a kind of 
cloak gathered on the fhoulder: the female figure is kneeling, as a reprefenta- 
tion of piety or faith, clinging to a tree bearing cluffered fruit.
— If this was 
intended to reprefent Adam’s expullion from paradife, I think it was abfurd to 
put him in a remonftrating attitude, as contending in words with the vindictive 
Minifter of heaven.
The wefi: front has the figure of a crofs, and a fliield fup- 
ported by two ravens.
The ornamental figures which are fcattered over this 
piece of antiquity, we think are no more hieroglyphic, than the ornaments on the 
capitals of pillars in the old Saxon churches ; they have been merely the fancy of 
the fculptor.
The conception that the font itfelf is of much greater antiquity than 
the event recorded by the infeription, is unaccountable ; for the label or fillet on

A fchool, and an alms-houfe for four poor men or women, were founded and 
endowed here in the beginning of this century, by Jofeph Afhley.;!: 
Papcastle, on the banks of Derwent, was the feat of Waldeof, firft Lord of 
Allerdale, before he built the caftle of Cockermouth, which afterwards was his 
baronial feat.
It is faid, he removed the materials ; but that is fcarce probable.
Male illue failed in the fecond generation, and Ochtreda, the wife of Duncan, 
brother to David King of Scotland, fucceeded to Papcaftle.
This manor by 
marriage* palfed to the Lucies, and under the fettlement of Richard Lucy on Ada 
his M'iS, fire, by marrying a Multon to her fecond hufband, carried it over to that 
houfe, whofe male line foon failing, it palfed by marriage of the heirefs to the 
Dacres, and, under the attainder of Leonard Dacre, came to the crown in the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth ; (he, in her 38th year, granted the fame to Salkeld, 
Brathvvaite, and Xolfon,'!' who, it appears, foon after fold the fame to the 
Lampleughs.
Difputes have arifen about the name of Papcaftle.
It appears that Waldeof re- 
moved to Cockermouth, and, it is faid, defaced this caftle : it is probable the 
hufband of Alicia, Gilbert Pipard, rebuilt the cafxle, and called it by his name — 
the corruption from Pipard’s Caftle is familiar.
Camden fays " Over againft 
Cockermouth, on the other fide of the river, at about two miles diftance, are the 
« ruins of an old caftle, called Papcaftle, the Roman antiquity whereof is attefled 
by feveral monuments.

FROM THE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE LATE ROGER GALE, ES^ 
ExtraSl of a Letter from Mr. Routh, fun.
dated i()th Jan. 1741 -2.
“ As to the ruins at Papcaftle, I made as particular enquiry as I could of the 
** man in whofc grounds they were difeovered, and of fome of his neighbours who 
were prefent at the finding of them.
The clofe in which they lay is a little to 
" the fouthward of the fort, on the declivity of the hill towards the river, and is 
** bounded on the weft by a narrow lane, probably the via milharis continued, and 
is ufually fhewn to ftrangers as a place the moft remarkable here for finding of 
Roman coins.
“ Thefe are the largeft ruins ever known to be difeovered in thefe parts ; for 
“ they met with three walls, befides the pavement ; the firft, laid call and weft, 
was covered with earth nigh a foot high, parallel to it, at the diftance of about 
" feven yards, they found a fecond ; between thefe two, about two yards deep (the 
“ height of the walls*j they came to a pavement curioufly laid with large flags, 
" three quarters of a yard fquare, and two or three inches thick, as I meafured 
“ them ; but, imagining money muft have been hid there, they covered it again 
“ till night, when they tore it all up, as far as they had opened it.
It was com- 
" pofed of flags of different thicknefs; under the thinner was found a coarfe, ftrong 
“ cement, which has caufed all thofe to be broken in the taking up ; whereas the 
thicker are pretty intire : part of the w'all flood upon the floor, and the edge wasr 
fccured by a fine red cement, two inches thick, which they fuppofe was intended 
to keep the floor dry.
They imagine they were at a corner of the building, 
the third wall ftanding at right angles with the firft and fecond, and parallel to 
“ the ftony lane, upon w'hich was an old hedge.
“ Upon the floor they found a fort of a ftone trough, or rather bafe of a pillar,' 
about a foot high, the hollowed part fquare, and about two inches deep.
“ In digging likewife they met with a fmall earthen veffel, which I procured, 
of the fine red clay, beautifully fmooth, with letters impreft on the bottom, but 
“ fo defaced as not to be intelligible : — the people call it a falt-feller,§ from its 
fliape.
Some years ago this man’s father dug up a conduit.
The owner had no 
" coins when I faw him, nor knew of any that had been dug up there for fomc 
" time.”

C 260 ^ 
THE PARISH OF CAMMERTON 
(in ALLERDALE ward below DERWENT) 
L ies towards the fea.* It is divided into two manors, Seaton the paramount, 
and Cammejton a mefne manor, both dependent on the barony of Allerdale.
Waldeof gave thefe manors to Orme, fon of Kctel, with Gunild his lifter, in 
dowery.
The chief feat was at Seaton, where fome ruins are pointed out, as the 
remains of Orme’s manfion-houfe.
Both the manors are the property of the family 
of Curwen, who are lineally defcended from Orme,t as v/e have before fet forth at 
Workington.
The manfion-houfe at Cammerton is gone to decay, except only a 
tower which ftands at the weft end of the town.;{] The demefne lies warm by the river 
* It is bounded by the river Derwent on the fouth, by the fea on the weft, and by Flimby on the 
north and eaft.
f Though the male line did not fail, the family of Orme took the name of Cammerton ; and after- 
wards, in compliment to the family with whom they Intermarried, took the name of Culweu 01 Curwen.
Extemt.] Along theDerwent from the fea, Is about three miles and a half, and about two miles In width.
Almoft one third of the land in this parifli Is common, being part of what generally goes by the name 
of Dearham Moor.
The whole is cultivatable, but, being moift ground, few ftieep are kept upon it.
— 
The foil Is a deep clay ; it affords pretty good pafturage for horfes and Scotch cattle ; of the latter the 
proprietors buy In a great number at three years old, and fell them at five : they feldom houfe them.
Soil and Produce.] The foil is chiefly clay ; near the river it is rather loamy, and produces good 
crops of wheat, a little barley and oats ; but of late the farmers have favoured grafs land very much, 
for hay to fupply Workington.
The land near the river is particularly fertile, both for grafs and corn.
Manufactory.] Of iron, as mentioned under the title of Workington.
Mines.] Coal, but no limeftone.
— A quarry of grey freeftone.
Tithes.] In kind corn, wool, lamb, &c.
ScooHL.] Not endowed.
Tenure.] Cuftomary, pays a 2 od.
fine at death of lord and tenant.
Lord Lonfdale is Lord of 
Seaton manor, and Mr. Cook of Cammerton-Hall Is Lord of the manor of Cammerton.
Rivers and Roads.] The Derwent bounds the fouth fide of this parifli.
No roads of any note lead 
through here ; one road along the coaft to Maryport, and another through Seaton to Dearham.
Warren.] The land is light near the coaft, and is flocked with rabbits.
Antiquities.] Burrow Caftle, towards the fea, not far from Workington, in ruins; Lord Lonfdale’s, 
by purchafe from one of the name of Pelham.
— Tradition fays that, fome centuries ago, this caftle belonged 
-to a renowned warrior, who went by the name of Black Tom of the North ; whofe effigy, at full length, 
lies in Cammerton church, in complete armour.
Between Seaton and the fea is a place called St. Ellen's, 
formerly fortified.
It is faid there was a chapel there.
It ftands upon a rifing ground, with a brook on 
one fide, and the other fides moated in a femicircular form, commanding a view of the fea.
Aspect and Appearance.] This parifli is not hilly ; the land rifes a little in the middle, but does 
not decline rapidly to either fide.
The coaft Is neither hlj;h nor rocky.
The country In general being 
deftitute of wood, has a naked appearance.
The buildings are good, and covered with blue flate.
— 
Cammerlon-Hall, the manfion houfe of Mr. Cook, is an old but good building, and pleafantly fituated.
Flimby is a fmall townflilp and chapelry, fituated upon the coaft between Dearham and Cammerton.
The land inclines to the fea ; moft part level, and lies low.
'fhe foil Is In part fhallow and barren, and 
part of it fertile.
There Is a large tradl of woodland, — little timber growing, — moft of it brufliwood.

There is a bridge between Workington and Seaton demefne.

And fo became Seaton a manor, and the faid Orme firfl: lord (after the 
conquefl: of the fame.) The walls and ruins of his manfion-houfe are yet to be

The faid Orme, the fon of Ketell, had ilTue a

W E vifited the fitc of an old caRle at Ewanrigg, or Ewanregg.
The 
account given of it having excited our curiofity, as, by tradition, it is 
pointed out to be the ancient ftronghold of Ewan, a northern king or chieftain.
— 
There is nothing remarkable in this remain ; but the concurrence of the name of 
Ewan CaRle with that of Caftle Ewaine, near Armathwaite ; as they feem to cor- 
refpond with each other, and with the tradition of Ewan’s monument in Penrith 
church-yard ; point out that a perfon of that name, of great power,* exifted :

)• A valuable correfpondent has communicated to us the following curious conjedlurcs on our Penrith 
Giant, which we here prefcnt to the reader : — 
On a fubje£l, which admits only of conjedlure, we hope to be pardoned for guefling, that this our 
Penrith giant, however much tradition has difguifed the name, by metamorphofing It into a mixture 
of Britilh and Roman, may have been a northern earl, of great note in his day, of the name of 
Siinard Digre ; a name given him, becaufe of his immenfe bulk.
From the “ Gefta et Veftigia Dano- 
“ rum in Anglia,” we colleft the following notices of him ; there faid to be quoted from Bartholinus, 
and Bromton and Knyghton : — 
“ Circa hoc Tempos (fcilt.
1042) pene Gigas Statura, venit in Angllam.
Hie fult filius 
“ BernI (iDicrn) comitis Daniae, qui genitus erat ex filia, de regio genere Danorum et Urfo.

“ ingdoniae fe viliter traftantem, occidit : Rex porro ei pofleffiones ac honores non exiles, 11 fecum ftaret, 
“ promifit.
Rcge enim a Danis infeflato, confulebant terras majores, et monebant, quod parvus Daemon 
“ magno DaemonI traderetur.
Sicque Rex Sivardo concelllt Weftmerlandiam, et Northumbriam, et 
•* Cumhriavi : quas quidem terras potenter pacificavit, et Regis Inimicos contrivit.” &c.
The manner of his death was remarkable.
Seized with a dyfentery.
It llung him to the quick, that 
he who had fo often refeued himfelf from death in battle, Ihould at length be doomed to fubmit to the 
grim tyrant, In the calmnefs of peace, on his bed.
So, ordering himfelf to be completely clad in armour, he 
refclved, with Vefpafian, to die (landing : “ ut,” as the ftory concludes, “ taliter moriendo, memoriara 
“ nominis fui Icngifllrr.am efficeret.” — His fize, rank, ambition of being recorded to pofterity, and every 
thing bu the uan.e, agrees well with our Penrith hero.

The manor, town, and church of Deariiam were granted out in moieties by

The vicarage houfe, as it was eredled by an incumbent, may naturally be con- 
ceived to be fmall; when one confiders the fmallnefs of the living, even 
with the advantage of a late augmentation of 400I.
which, by purchafe of lands, 
produces half the income: what is there for building houfes, after the incumbent 
has taken there from what muft fuftain nature ?
But, when half the prefent income 
was to procure the edifice, the traveller cannot w'onder that the whole firudure is 
but twenty-four feet in length, and equally low as confined.

THE PARISH OF CROSS- CANONBY 
(in ALLERDALE W'ARD below derw^ent.) 
E now call our reader’s attention to this parifh, where the town and 
haven of 
MARYPORT 
enliven the fliore.
— This town, like the manor of Ellenborough, is divided into 
two parts by the river Ellen, more anciently Alne.
The principal part of the 
town is on the north fide of the river, and in this parifli : a fmall part of it is on 
the fouth fide of the river, and in the parifli of Dearham, — Within forty years lafi: 
pafi this place has rifen to importance; being before that rime the mere refort of 
fifhermen, who had a few miferable cabins along the beach.
This is one of the great 
evidences to prove the bleffings derived from the union of the crowns, and the 
eradication of thofe miferable animofities and contentions which, before that event, 
employed the inhabitants, and laid wafte this county, and the adjacent county of 
Northumberland.
The coal trade is the chief flaple of this part of the country ; 
but from it arc derived alfo others of growing importance ; the working of an 
iron furnace, a glafs-houfe, falt-works, and a pottery.* 
in this fmall period of time, the number of families fettled here is faid to exceed 
four hundred.
In Burn’s account of families, certified in 1747, in this whole parijb 
\\c find only fixty-four; in 1750, there w'ere only fifty inhabited houfes ; and in 
1 781, three hundred and fifty-five.f The land at Maryport is become of fuch 
value, that, on a building leafe, it lets from 6d.
to 2s.
6d.
a yard in front, and 4d.
backwards.
There are about ninety veffels belonging to this port, fome of which 
are two hundred and fifty tons burthenj upon an average one hundred and twenty 
* “ Keep along the fiiore to Maryport, another new creation, the property of Humphrey Senhoufe, 
Efq. and fo named by him in honour of his lady : the fecond houfe was built only in i 750.
Now there 
are above one hundred, peopled by thirteen hundred fouls, all collefted together by the opening of a coal 
trade on this eltate.
For the convenicncy of (hipping (there being above feventy of different fizes, from 
tliirty to three hundred tons burden, belonging to the harbour) are wooden piers with quays on the river 
Elen, where lltips lie and receive their lading.
Befide the coal trade, is fome (kinning bulinefs, and a 
rope yard.” Pennant’s Tour, 1774.
+ It now contains 685 families, and above 3000 inhabitants.
tons 
PARISH OF CROSS- CANONBY.
267 
tons each; and feven men and a boy to each vefTcl. Their chief trade is the export 
of coals to Ireland; but they alfo flaip iron and glafs to diftant poits.
Before 
the unhappy divifion between the mother country and the colonies, they fent out 
fcveral fliips to America.
They import timber, flax, and iron, from the Baltic.
This place is happily lituated for fca-bathing, and is greatly reforted to in the 
proper feafons.
In 1760, a chapel was founded here, and confecrated by Bifhop Lyttleton in 
1763 : dedicated to St. Mary.
By a donation of 200I.
by the late Humphrey 
Senhoufe, Efq. and the like fum obtained from the governors of Queen Anne’s 
bounty, with other perquifites, and a charge upon the pews, the curate’s falary or 
flipend amounts to about 35I.
a year.
The nomination of curate was refer ved in, 
the act cf confecration to the heirs of Mr. Senhoufe, the founder.
In this pariflij] are two diflinct manors.
The manor of Cross r, or Cross- 
Canonby, and that of Birkby.
Both thefe manors appertained to the barony of Allerdale.
The manor of 
Crosby, or Cross-Canonby, was never fevered till the reign of King Heni^ VIII.
being part of the poflTefllons of the Lucies, which the fixth Earl of Northumber- 
land transferred to the crown.
In the 37th year of that reign it was granted out,§ 
and paired through many purchafers, till at length it came to the family of Porters, 
ot W'eary-Hall, and, by the great great grandfon of the purchafer of that name, 
fold out to the tenants of the manor.
li It lies S.
W. from Hayton, bounded on the S.
and W.
by the fca, by Hayton fields on the N.
and 
by Allerby Crooks and paftures on the E.
This parifii is of a triangular figure, and contains about four fquare miles.
Between Birkby and 
Crofby there is a fmall common of good land, moftly depaftured with black cattle.
Soil and Produce.] The foil in general is a light loam or gravel, and produces early crops (parti- 
cularly near the river) of wheat, barley, oats, &c.
with fomc few turnips.
Towards Maryport the land 
is very fertile, and chiefly kept in meadows or paftures.
Rabbits, &c.] A warren on the coaft, belonging to Mr. Senhoufe.
— He has alfo a fmall deer-park.
Quarries, &c.] A quarry of freeftone : by the implements found in it, it appears to have been 
wrought by the Romans.
— No limeftone.
— Coals, belonging to Mr. Senhoufe.
Maryport is at prefent a confiderable market-town, and port for the exportation of coals.
A few 
years ago it was like to have loft its population, by the failure of the coal-mines ; but new feams of coal 
having been opened, trade now flouriftics again.
The town is neat, the ftreets are open, and the air 
healthy.
There is a perfon living in this town aged 1 12 years ; another died lately at the age of 107.
Nether-Hall Hands at a little diftance from the port, up the river Ellen, in a neat and pleafant 
fituation.
Here is annually given, on the 27th of February, a good dinner and 2s.
6d.
to forty poor 
widows, according to the bequeft of a lady of the Senhoufe family, who left lool.
for that pm-pofe.
Ma NUFACTUREs, &c.] A cotton manufaclorv is lately fet forward, which employs between four and 
five hundred people.
Two ftiip-yards, which employ above one hundred carpenters.
Roads a nd Rivers.] No roads of note.
— The river Ellen bounds the pariftr to the fouth ; there arc 
trout and falmon in this river ; the falmon Mr. Senhoufe takes in coops.
Aspect and General Appearance.] Part of this pariftr inclines to the river, and the reft towards 
the fea ; it is rather hilly, and the villages moftly ftand high, and are fliehered with a few trees.
The 
fouth fide of the parifh, particularly about Nether-Hall, is pleafant, the lands fertile, and the fields regu- 
lar and well fenced with quickfets, — The other parts are rather bare.
— Some part of the coaft is high, 
but not rocky.
— Herrings a few years ago were taken here in large quantities.

In Mr. Horfley’s work we find the infcrlptlons found at Elenborough thus mentioned : 
“ I believe there Is no one Roman ftation in Britain, where fo great a number of infcrlptlons have 
been found, as at Elenborough ; and mod of the originals are yet preferved at Elenborough-Hall, the feat 
of Humphrey Senhoufe, Efq. who is the proprietor of the ground on which the Roman datlon has been, 
and the worthy defeendant of John Senhoufe, Efq. whom Camden commends for his great civility to Sir 
Robert Cotton and himfelf, for his ileill in antiquity, and for the great care with which he preferved fucli 
curiofities.
The foldiers that feem to have been in garrifon here, are the Cohors prima HifpaftorutHy 
Cohors prima Dahnatarum, and the Cohors prirna Bxtajiorum : at lead thefe are all mentioned in fomc

This done was prefented to Mr. Kirby, of Afhlack, in Lancafliire,

I will not 
pretend to determine whetlrer we are to under dand the fame Cohort here as In the former infeription ; for 
they are cxprefsly called horfe, and are faid to be under a prasfeft; but here the word equitum is not expreded, 
and the officer is called a tribune, who Is alfo of a different name from the former: but that the terms

This infeription is upon an altar which feems to have been eredied by the fame Cohort 
as the former ; though, as it appears to me, much after it.
The ftone is now in the Ifle of Mann, In the

according to the dlmenfions and copy given of it in the appendix to Mr. Gordon’s Itinerarium Septen- 
tricnale.
The ingenious author of that letter fuppofes it to have been in the time of Marcus Aurelius ; 
but the form of fome of the letters inclines me think It mull have been later, particularly the cut of the 
li, which I have confidered before, in my obfervations on the infeription on the rock at the Gelt.

"I'his is the fineft and moft curious Roman altar that ever was difeovered in Britain, 
'J he draught of it I think has been given no where, except in Camden’s Britannia, and there not very 
correftly.
It was found at this Ration, and removed from Elenborongh-Hall to Flathall, near Whitehaven, 
the feat of James Lowther, Efq. where it is carefully preferved.
But though the altar is fine, the inferip- 
tion feems to be coarfe ; and I have often obferved, that rude inferiptions are upon beautiful altars.
The 
itifcription at prefent is in fome parts, efpeclally towards the end, nearly effaced, where, no doubt, it was 
vifible enough when Camden firll copied it ; and, in thefe parts, I took the help of his reading, in order 
to make the whole as compleat as I could.
It will be proper firfl to take notice of the infeription, 
and then of the fculpture.
“ The altar is inferibed Genio Ltd, Fortuna teduci Roma JEterna, et Fato hono.
It is well known that 
places had their Genii, as well as perfons and Rates : and it was a common pradlice for the Romans t® 
make their addreffes to the Genius of the place, even where they were Rrangers.
So Mneas, when he 
arrives at the mouth of the Tiber ; 
Frondente tempera ramo 
ImpUcat, et Geniumque loci, prwianique dcorum 
Fellurem, Nympkafque, et adhuc ignota precatur 
Flurnina.
“ We have alfo another monument, inferibed Genio Loci, found at York.
Fortuna redux and Romsi 
JEterna are alfo common, both on coins and inferiptions ; fo that thefe three firR are not unufual ; but 
Fato hono is fomewhat peculiar ; "j'ct we have another InRance in Britain of an altar, Marti Vidorit Genie 
Loci,et Bono Eventui : and thefe two feem to be much the fame Bonum Fatum and Bonus Eventus.
This 
cpitliet is added to other gods and goddeffes.
Among the Arundelian colledlion we have Bona Dea 
Feneri, and Virgil afcribes it to Juno.
Pliny deferibes the image of Bonus Eventus, as “ holding a 
patera In the right hand, an ear of corn and poppy in the left.” The figure of It upon medals is agreeable 
to this defcription.
In a coin of Antoninus Pius, It has a patera over a flaming altar in one hand, and 
cars of corn in the ether.
I mention this now, becaufe It may help us to underRand what relates to the 
fculpture upon this altar.
I only further add, for the fame purpofe, that, as Burton Informs us, “ Severus’s 
Bonus Eventus Rands robed with corn In the charger, poppy and an ear of corn in the left.” What 
follows in the infeription is the name of the tribune, Gaius Corsielius Feregrinus, but what Cohort he 
commanded I know not, for I believe what follows exprefles his own country, namely, Mauritania Cafa- 
rienfis, like what was before in another infeription ; for Mauritania, as Is well known, w'as divided int* 
Tigritana and Cafarienfis.
The Barcarii Tigritenfes are, in the Notitia, placed at Arheia ; and 9.
numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum at Aballaha.
I am at a lofs to underRand Camden’s fuppllment to the 
end of this infeription If we are to read decurionum ordinem refituit In this place, what muR be 
done with Domos et JEdes ?
He feems afterwards to join all three together, as if this tribune had reRored 
houfes, temples, and the order of the Decuriones : but then another et feems to be wanting before 
decurionum, and, therefore, I think it is much better to leave out the word ordinem, for which there is 
not room on the altar, and then all Is plain and cafy.
“ On the back of the altar is Volanti Vivas, where Volanti does not appear with a double I, as In 
Camden.
His conjeAure, &c and from hence he conjedlures that this place has been called 
V olantium; though ethers fuppofe it to be Olenacum.
But I fee no neceffity to fuppofe the altar was 
Mm2 erected

“ The fecond altar delineated here, was dug up at Old Carlifle, a^nd remained’ 
** in the houfe of the Barwifcs (now the Kirbys, at ilkirk, but is, I believe, re- 
“ moved to Drumbugh, in this, county) it had many legatures, or connedlions of 
letters, the engraver has given you pretty exadlly.
It feems to be read thus : 
" Jovic 
ereftetl by the mhabitants ; they might order thefe words to be cut upon it after it was erefted : and I 
find Petrel Bibas at the end of an infeription in Gruter, where B is put inftead of VI, fo that it is Petrel 
Vlvaf ; and perhaps a parallel inllance to this which is now before us: and In Monfaucon we have a Teffera 
with Faujle Vivas upon It ; and likewife in the fame author Vakntlnlane Zefes, that is, Vivas.* Thefe 
inftances make me fuTpeft, that Volantl may be the name of fome perfon, addreffed to in the vocative 
cafe, like Petrel : and I am inclined to think the name of this place was Vlrofidum in the time of the 
Notitia.
'  
“ In the fculpture, befidfs what is purely ornamental,, there is upon the back of the altar the ufual.
lacrificing ax and knife ; and upon one fide the patera and preeferlciilum.
“ On the right fide,” fay* 
Camden, “ (according to the tranflation) Is a goblet, a difii, and a pear (if 1 judge right) though other* 
will have It to be a holy water-pot.” But what he takes to be a pear, (which I remember not among 
the fymbols of any of the deities) I took at firft for a pine apple, two of which are alfo upon the face of 
the capital of the altar : but I now rather believe they have been defigned for fplcx, or ears of corn.
The reprefentation feems to be very nearly the fame with what I obferved on a fine medal of Auguftus, , 
which I faw at I,.ondon, where no diftinftlon of the feveral ears appeared.
1 am alfo of opinion that the 
fculpture which is between the two heads in the front of the capital, has been a bunch of corn, though no 
marks of diftindlion did clearly appear.
This fiiits Event us, or Bonum Fatuw; and Horace joins 
Ceres, to whom ears of corn are alfo fuitable, with /llnia Faujiltas.
What Camden calls a dilh, I take, 
to be a wheel; the moil: natural and diftinguilhing fymbol of Fortune, another of the deities to whom 
this altar is inferibed : and what he calls a go'olet, (If I miftake him not) I apprehend to be fomewhat.
of a patera or diflr.
This might perhaps be defigned to contain the flowers, or the wine for the Genius.
The two full faces on the capital of the front manifeftly reprefent the fun.
It feems alfo to be the fun 
Jhining, that is in the capital at the back of the altar : and perhaps this may reprefent the fetting, as 
the others the meridian fun.
All thefe fymbols fuit well enough, the contents of the infeription ; or the 
imaginary deities to whom the altar was dedicated.

“ There is another Infeription found at this place, the original of which is loft.

Victoria Augujhruvi Dosnlnorusn hcflrosum.
This Infeription Is In a corona fupported by 
two vlBorles, which is a form we frequently meet with.
Camden calls them two-winged genii fupporting 
e garland ; but this muft be a miftake, for they are plainly female figures.
The principal thing that 
concerns this infeription is to fix the emperors, for whofe honour it was erefted : and the words Dosnlnl 
Etojlrl may help us as to this matter.
I know none more likely than Diocletian and Maximlan.
Span- 
heim carries this title in the plural no higher than Conftantine the Great : but there is an infeription 
found at Tadmor, and deferibed in the Phiiofophical IVanfaftions, which I believe ought to be read, — 
Confervatores Orbls, et propagatora generis htimanl, .Domini Noflrl Dlocletlanus et Maxlmlanus fortljfwii

Camden has alfo confufed the laft line, and Gruter more, by making an H at the

The laft I of the three, in the laft line, has the numeral ftroke above it, and it 
appears over that only.
No doubt the three III have been intended both for numerals, and to include 
an M in them.

“ The remains of the Roman gateway at the north entrance of the fort were difeovered in 1787.
— 
Prom what remains of this building, which was probably the guard-room, it muft have been a very elegant 
ilrufture.
The ftoues, which are fliaped and drefled, fit clofe to each other without cement.
At the end 
of the corner Hone, was an iron ftanchion, on which it is fuppofed the gate was hung, and from whence, 
at the bottom, the Hone threfhold was carried acrofs to the length of near ten feet.
On the top are two 
hollows, which people imagine were worn by wheels, but (as they are near eight feet afunder) no carriage 
could have been of that width ; and they evidently appear to have been fcooped out with a tool.
Not long after this difeovery, in digging in the front of the gateway, they found the arch entire 
which had covered the gate ; but Col. benhoufe being unfortunately from home at that time, the arch 
was deftroyed, and the Hones carried away for the repair of walls.
From this gate a Roman road goes, 
in almoH a ftraight line, to Carlifle.
“ The remains of an elegant Roman bath were difeovered within the fort In the year 1788.
There 
appears to have been a paved walk, two feet wide, carried round, from whence fome of the Heps that went 
into the bath remain.
The height of the upper wall is two feet ten inches, the length of the bath 
fixteen feet.
“ Walls of feveral buildings have been laid open to a confiderable length ; and, if one may judge from 
their thicknefs, they muH have inclofed fpaclous apartments.
Col. Senheufe keeps a man daily at work 
in fearching, and clearing the walls within the fort ; and he will doubtlefs be well rewarded for his pains, 
by the acquifition of many curious Roman monuments.
Thefe, fortunately for the lovers of antiquities, 
arc fure to be well pteferved, for which this gentleman is no lefs commendable than for his pelltenefs and 
bofpitality to thofe whole curiofity lead them to Nether-Hall.”

There is alfo a ftone very curioufly engraved, upon which are two winged 
genii fupporting a garland : — 
« VICTORIA AUGUSTORUM DOMINORUM NOSTRORUM.” 
It was the opinion of Mr. Horfley and Mr. Warburton, that this was the 
Virofidum of the Notitia.
It fhews, by its open and elevated fituation, that it was 
chiefly calculated for a command of the fliore, and to have a wide look out to fea.
Mr. Camden’s idea of its being a guard againft the Irilh, feems to be carrying the 
purpofe from home, for its ufe was more readily applied againft the Scots, it 
looking upon a long extent of their coaft, from whence, by open boats, the enemy 
might have landed within the great barrier, had not this ftation and that at 
Morrefby commanded the ftiore : and this is ftill more probable, when we con- 
fider it commands a very narrow land profpetft, and is upon the banks of the Elne, 
in which an enemy might have fkulked and concealed themfclves.
Mr. Horfley 
fays — “ The noble remains of antiquity here appear in great plenty, fo that there 
“ is no doubt it has been a Notitia ftation.
The fame military-way which pafles 
through Old Carlifle, is continued to Elenborough.
But, befides this, another 
military- w-ay is faid to have gone from hence diredly to Boulnefs, which, if 
“ true, for I have not feen it, is more oblervable, fince as I think there fcarce has 
been any ftation upon this way between Elenborough and the wall.” 
The way mentioned leading through Old Carlifle, is very confpicuous north of 
that ftation, but old inclofures receive it immediately to the fouthward ; and about 
Midiummer, when we were there on our leveral journeys, there appeared no 
poflibility of tracing its diredlions, foas to afeertain that it led to Elenborough.
— 
The other road to Boulnefs, if it ever exifted, we could not make out.
Bynhe authority of the Notitia, it appears, that, at Virofidum, the Cohors Sexta 
Nerviorum was ftationed.
Mr, Horfley and other antiquaries of great abilities 
admit, that there has not been difeovered at Elenborough any infcription of that 
Cohort.
“ But it is alfo evident from the Notitia, thatthefe Cohorts, which ap- 
“ pear from inferiptions to have been fome time at Elenborough, were in the 
“ decline of the empire removed to different parts.
This makes it probable that 
the Cohors Sexta Nerviorum, which w as before in the weftern part of Yorkftiire 
(as appears from an infcription, No. j 8, in the Brit, Rom. for Yorkfhirc) did 
advance to this ftation at Elenborough, when the other left it.
And I obferve, 
“ that 
VIROSIDUM.
that the Nervi Di^tenfes were, according to the Notitia, in garrifon at Dictum, 
which I believe to have been another ftation, at no great diftance, mofl: likely at 
Amblefide ; and thefe Nervi Didtenfes might probably be a part of this Cohort, 
** and fo they were polled near to each other.” 
This occafions us again to remark the uncertainty there is in fixing the proper 
name of every llation, by the inferiptions found there ; for, like modern garrifons, 
it is probable the troops would not continually remain in one and the fame flation.
We do not read of their making any permanent property in lands, — the chief 
diltindlion of a fettled abode.
When they were removed, they certainly would 
move with them their holy things ; for no people appear to be more attached to 
their religious maxims and facred olTices.
Some of thefe, on the entire defertion 
of a llation, have been fee reted ; and are now difeovered moll commonly by acci- 
dental means — They had a religious abhorrence of thofe who did not profefs the 
fame tenets ; much more (it is to be regretted) than we have againll thofe w'ho 
deny the Chriltian revelation : and confequently they would feel the mofl pointed 
jealoufy of the pollution of their confecrated altars, in the hands of the Pidls and 
Scots.
It may be alledged, that mofl of the dedications come to our knowledge w'erc 
only temporary' and perfonal ; and the veneration for fuch would lall no longer 
than the life of the perfon by whom it was erefted, or the occalion from whence 
the immediate confecration arofe: bur that is railing an uncertain and unreafonable 
polition : the devotees of the fame deity, or rather attribute of the univerfal Jove, 
would venerate and perhaps ufe the altar eredled by predecelTors ; or otherwife the 
land mull have been filled with their religious monuments ; or there were few 
devotees.
It is obfervable, and indeed it is no new remark, for Mr. Horlley and Mr.
Warburton made the fame, that the flations on the coall of the weftern ocean lie 
much clofcr to each other, and nearer to the wall, than thofe on the eafiern ocean 
and other end of the w'all.
There was an obvious reafon for this, and we re- 
marked it before, that the Scotch land ftretches away wellward, and fhews a long 
extended coall ; from whence, no doubt, (as well from its vicinity to Ireland, for 
receiving reinforcements, it being a lliort and fafe pafiage, as from its mountainous 
faflnelfes, where they could colled and fecure the troops) they could hallily pour 
forth their ravaging bands, on the firft intelligence of negligence, fupinenefs, and 
vain lecurity in the Romans ; or of their being drawn off from the borders, and 
weakened by fome interior fervices.
It has been conjedured, “ the eafiern fide 
“ of the ifland was more unpalfable for w’oods, and lels inhabited:” but certain it 
is, the moll ufual inroads of the northern nations were on the well.
Mr. Horfley 
fays Ireland is fuppofed to be ” the ancient Scotia; and 1 think the Scoti were very 
“ formidable, and infefled the province much in the decline of the empire.” 
“ The paffage from Ireland to Scotland is fiiort and eafy, and the attacks of the 
enemy from thence would be moll frequent on the well end of the wall.” 
This llation has a double rampart, that is, the inner line fhews the remains of 
the ufiial fortification, by a Hone wail of great flrength ; the ditch next takes place, 
and a line or ndge, v hie h appears to have been a firong breafr-work of turf, per- 
haps fenced with a paliiado; and then fviccceds an ouiw'ard ditch, which appears

to have been carried deeper than the inner one, if one may be allowed to judge 
from the prefent Rate of things, though the place has undoubtedly undergone a 
very great change by the deftrueflion of the valiums.
Mr. Horfley fays there is a round exploratory mount " in a point of land not 
‘‘ far from the Ration.” Since his time this has undergone fome refearches, 
which we Riall particularly notice.
Sixty-three paces fouth-weR from the agger, 
or outer fofle ot the camp, an artificial mount hath been raifed, the circumference 
whereof, at the verge, is about two hundred and fifty feet, the height forty-two 
feet, and the perpendicular height fourteen feet.
There is a tradition among the 
neighbouring people, that a king was buried here, and it has gone by the name of 
the King's Burying Place.
The late Humphrey Senhoufe, Efq. about the year 
1742, caufed a cut ten feet wide to be made into it as far as the centre, but no 
urns, bones, or other matter appeared, whereby to difeover to what purpofe it was 
raifed.
It feems indeed to have been more ancient than the Roman times.
FROM THE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE LATE ROGER GALE, ESQ^ 
^Letter from Mr. Phomas Routh^ dated 30//; May, 1742.
LaR week an account was fent me, that Mr. Senhoufe, of Nether-Hall, had 
ordered a tumulus, or mount of earth, which lies about fixty yards eaRward of 
** the fort at Elenborough, to be fearched into, in hopes of meeting with fomething 
** remarkable.
The mount is about five yards in height, and conliRs of feveral 
Rrata.
They began at the circumference, level with the ground, and cut to the 
•* centre, in the nature of a profile.
The firR layer at the bottom was found to be 
“ turf fet edgeways about two feet high, with breckens, which had formerly grown 
** upon it, fcemingly freRi. The fecond was whitifli clay three-fourths of a yard ; 
** the next was blue, near a yard ; a diR'erent of half a yard made the fourth ; above 
that lay a plate of metal, which begun at the Rratum of white clay, and was 
** carried obliquely up the fides, till it w’ent off horizontally at an acute angle be- 
tween the fourth and fifth Rrata; the whole fomewhat refembling a cap; above 
“ the plate was a fecond layer of blue clay, and the fixth, which made the top of 
“ the hill, was pure earth.
*' What is called metal here, was a hard red cement, as appeared by a piece of 
it, fent to me afterwards by Mr. Routh.

It gave me great pleafure to review the fculptures engraven in Mr. Horfley’s 
** Antiquities, and preferved in the walls of this place.
The following were fixed 
in the walls of the houfe, by the anceftor of Mr. Senhoufe co-eval with Camden.
Hercules appears on one lide of No. 65, with his club; and in one hand the 
Hefperian apples that he had conveyed ab infomni male cujiodila dracone on 
“ the other, a man holding a thick pole with one hand, the right refting on a 
“ wheel, probably denoting his having fucceeded in opening fome great road.f 
“In No. 70, are feen the two victories fupporting a triumphal crown, the 
“ VidtoriiS Augujii.
“ The local goddefs Setlocenia, with long flowing hair, wdth a vcflel in her.
“ hand, fills the front of one (tone: and an altar inferibed to her is lodged in one 
of the garden walls.
“ No. 74 is near the goddefs, a moft rude figure of a cavalier on his fieed.
“ In the fame wall with her altar, is No. 64, a monumental mutilated inferip- 
“ tion, fuppefed in honour of Antoninus Pius.
“ No. t]i.
The next monument notes the premature death of Julia Mamertina,.
“ at the age of twenty-one years and three months.
A rude head exprefles the 
“ lady, and a fetting fun, the funeral fubjeCt.
“ A female exprefling modcfly with one hand, the other lifted to her head,.
**" flands beneath an arch, as if about to bathe, and is marked in Horfley No. 73.
“ In a garden houfe is No.
.62, an altar to Jupiter, by the firfl: cohort of the 
Spanifh, whofe tribune was Marcus Menius Agrippa.
“ Another, No. 66, to Mars Militaris, devoted by the firfl: cohort of the Belgic.
“ Gauls, commanded by Julius Tutor.
“ And a third.
No. 67, to Jupiter, by Caius Caballus Prilcus, a tribune, but no- 
*♦ mention is made of the cohort.
“ Since I vifited this place, Mr. Senhoufe has favoured me with an account of 
“ other difeoveries, made by the removal of the earth that covered the reliques of 
this ftation : the ftreets and foot- ways have been traced paved with ftones fronr 
“ the fliore, or freeftone from the quarries : the lafl; much worn by ufe.
Many 
“ foundations of houfes, the cement flill very flrong; and the plaifter on fome 
remains of walls, appears to have been painted, with what is now pink colour: 
“ feveral vaults have been difeovered, one with freeftone fteps, much ufed : fire 
“ hearths open before, inclofcd with a circular wall behind: from the remains of 
the fuel, it is evident that the Romans have ufed both wood and pit coal.* Bones.
** and teeth of various animals ; and pieces of horns of flags, many of the latter 
** fawed, have been found here: alfo fhells of oyfters, mufcels, wilks, and fnails.
“ Broken earthen ware, and the handle of a large veffel marked AEL.
Fragments 
f The Idea which (truck us, on examining this altar and its fculptures, was, that the figures meant to 
imply that fome great commander, there reprefented with his lance and (hield, had performed fome 
Herculean labour ; — for we think the figure of Hercules, In no wife applied to by the infeription, was 
eniblematical only ; and the wheel, as Mr. Pennant Is plcafed to call it, is no more than a fliield ; the 
attitude and accoutrements being familiar on coins, &c.

“ of glafs vefTels and mirrors ; and two pieces of a painted glafs cup, which evinces 
“ the antiquity of that art.
An entire altar, found in the fame fearch, is to be added to the preceding: 
" three of the fides arc plain : the fourth has a hatchet exactly refembling thofc 
“ now in ule; and a broad knife, or rather clever, with which the viclims were 
“ cut up.
“ But the moft curious difeovery is a done three feet high, the top formed like 
" a pediment, with a neat fcallop fhell cut in the middle.
From each fide the 
“ pediment, falls a Rraight corded moulding; and between thofc, juft beneath the 
“fcallop, is a mutilated figure, the head being deftroyed; but from the body, 
“ which is cloathed with the fagum, and the bucket which it holds in one hand, 
“ by the handle, it appears to have been a Gaul, the only fculpturc of that kind 
“ found in our ifland.f — (No. 18 of our feries.)

In a letter publifhed in the Archaeologia, from Mr. Head, a Prebendary of 
Carlille, a fimilar account to Mr. Pennant’s was given of the opening of the 
tumulus at this place.
In another letter publifhed in that colledlion, dated 13th 
November, 1 766, we have the following account — “ Mr. Senhoufe, digging in the 
“ Roman ftation, on his eftate here, 1766, made fome curious difeoveries, which 
“ he communicated to the late Bifhop ot Carlifle the fame year.
“ The workmen opened, for the fecond time, a vault fuppofed to be the length

I S fiippofed to derive its name from Gofpatric, Earl of Dunbar, father of Waldeof, 
firff Lord of Allerdale.* 
In this parifli are five-feveral manors, that is to fay, Afpatria, Hayton, Outerby, 
Alwandby, and Brayton.
The town of Aspatria is irregular, and Draggles over the ridge of a dry Tandy 
eminence about half a mile in length.
f It was parcel of the barony of Alierdale, 
and the inheritance of William Fitz Duncan.
Afterwards we find it the poneffion 
of the Lucies, and pafling with the other property of that family to the Earl ot 
Northumberland, makes now a part of the effate of the Earl of Egremont.
It is 
a feigniory, under which are feveral mefne manors.
The church of Afpatria|| was rectorial, and-is dedicated to Sr. Kentigern; now 
worth about lool.

that parts Allerby and Crotby fields, and fo along that dyke northwards to the divifion between Haytoa 
and Canonby fields, then turning eaftward between Hayton and Alanby meadows, as the divifion is be- 
tween Newton demefne and Afpatria’s north Riving, then direftly eaftward along the common to the 
middle of Broadhead, and fo into Crumbock, and then up the beck to Ptieft croft, and turning weftward 
by the ring hedge of Leefrigg to King gate, and then to Baggray lane end, and fo along the hedge 
which fevers Brayton demefne from Baggray field to Elnbrig clofe to the foot thereof.
f It is bounded by' the common on the north, by the demefne of Brayton on the eaft, by Elne on the 
fouth, and by the demefnes of Outerfide and Hayton on the weft.
On the partition made to the three 
daughters of Fitz Duncan by Alice de Romley his wife, Afpatria was afiigned to Alice their youngeft 
daughter ; Ihe died without iffue, and her eftate was divided between her two fifters, or their reprefenta-

It is one of 
the principal manors of this barony, and many inferior lords are fubjeft to that court.

“ I ftiall now beg leave to lay before t^e,^ociety, an account of the contents of a barrow opened In

his pofterity took the name of De Hayton.
By marriage of a female heir, the 
daughter of John de Hayton, with Robert de Mulcafter, a younger fon of the 
Penningtons, 
Lord of Allerdale.
It Is a long ftraggllng village, about half a mile In length, and (lands upon the ridge 
of a hill pointing E.
and W.
the foil a dry fand.
“ Mr. Rigg, who Is the proprietor of the land where the barrow flood, was fo obliging as to give me- 
leave to take drawings of the antiquities he found there, and to fatisfy all my enquiries relative to the 
dlfcovery, at the fame time he afTured me that no other perfon had, or fhould take drawings of them.
“ About two hundred yards N.
of the village, and juft behind his houfc, is a riling ground called’ 
Beacon-bill, on the fummit of which the barrow was placed, commanding an cxtenfive view every way, 
and of courfe a very proper lltuation for a beacon, which was probably erefted on the barrow.
In 
levelling this, (the bafe of which I found to have been ninety feet in circumference) they removed fix 
feet of earth to the n^ral foil, and about three feet below, they found a vault or kiltvaen, formed with, 
two large cobble fton^on each fide, and one at each end.
In it v^as a llceleton of a man, which meafured 
feven feet from the head to the ancle bone ; the feet wei’e decayed and rotted off.
'I he bones at firll 
appeared perfedl, but, when expofed to the air, became very brittle.
“ On the left fide, near the (houlder, was a broad fword near five feet in length, the guard was elegantly 
ornamented w'lth inlaid lilver flowers.
See the figure of the faid fword at A in the plate.
On the right 
fide lay a dirk or dagger, one foot fix inches and a quarter in length, the handle appeared to have been 
ftudded with lilver.
See the figure at B.
Near the dagger was found part of a gold fibula or buckle,.
and an ornament for the end of a belt, a piece of which adhered to it when firft taken up.
This Mr.
Rigg proved to be gold by trying It with aquafortis ; fee figures C and D, the fize of the originals.
Several pieces of a (hield were picked up, but I did not fee parts fufiicient to make out the (hape.
There 
were alfo part of a battle axe as at E, length fix inches, width four inches, a bit F (haped like a modern 
fnuffle, length of the fide from (a) to (^b) four inches and a half, part of a fpur G, length from (a) to (r/) 
four inches.
Thefe were very much corroded with ruft.
H and I are the two large cobble ftones, which 
inclofed the weft fide of the kiftvaen.
H is two feet eight inches in length.
I is three feet in length, 
and one foot eight inches high.
On thefe ftones are various emblemari^i^ futures In rude fculpture, 
though fame, of the circles are cxaftly formed, and the rims and crofli^ .within them are cut in reliefl’ 
On the (lone I at (a) are marks which refemble an M and a D, but wfi?f!rer they were intended for 
thofe letters is very, doubtful.
— 
[We beg lea^e to remark (yet with gr^t (kfcrence to his judgirfent) on what Mr. Rooke fays of- 
thofe ftones, that late difeoveries induce us to believe fuch magical numbers and figures were ufed in ages 
long pofterior to the date of the remains treated oC 'in the preceding page ; and we are inclined to allcdge, 
that they were the work of very Ignorant forceters and wicked wretches.
— It appears to have been the 
praftice of tliofe conjurers, to lodge their tables of magical device and fculptures in ancient tumuli, as all 
the inftances come to our knowledge (hew ; from an idea that infernal fpirits vlfited fuch places of 
fepulture, and from thence could be driven by thofe machinations, to rvork fuch works of darknefs as the 
magician devifed.
— We have fcen.fcveral remains of tins kind ; but the mod perfeft one difeovered lu' 
the northern counties, w^^md in a tumulus near the Roman road which croffes Gatherly Moor, in the 
^ neighbourhood of Giying,^in Richmondfhire — We have given a reprefentatlon of the devices which 
were engraven on two brafs plates.
The infeription and numerals will not admit a conjefture that they 
were of greater antiquity than the laft century ; and perhaps the time of James 1 .
of England, when the 
terrors of fdreery prevailed.
What became of the family of Philip, we have not learnt; and whether they 
were reduced to utter beggry, and that nothing piofpcred with them, we are ignorant* 
We flatter ourfelves we (hall be pardoned by the curious reader for intruding this fpeclmen, to accom^ 
pany the ingenious Mr. Rooke’s drawing.] 
“ The ancients, we know, were fond of emblematical figures, and they frequently typified eternity by 
a circle.
As. fuch, it was natural for the fiuends of the deceafed to cut thofe fignificant marks on the 
unknown ftones of his fepulchre, to which they m.ight add i^j^ofs on the dawning of Chriftianity, that 
is, foon after Auguftine the monk arrived in Britain, whlch^as A.
D. 596.

The manor of Ravenfwick, or Renwick, as mentioned to have belonged to Robert 
Egglesfield in the ift of King Edward HI.
had been forfeited to the crown, in the time of King 
Edward II.
per attenturam Andrea de Harcla ; who had gone over to the King of Scotland, for which 
he was executed at Carlifle, as is related in feveral authorities.
This manor Robert Egglesfield had 
got from King Edward III.
in exchange for an eftate at Lalcham, in Middlefex : but, how, or by what 
means, he became poffeffed of an eftate in Middlefex, does not appear.
In the 14th of icing Edward III.
it is found by inquifitlon, that Robert Egglesfield granted the 
hamlet of Ravenwyke to the provoft and fcholars of Queen’s college, in Oxford, holden of the king in 
capite, by homage and fealty, and the rent of 2s.
8d to be paid yearly into the exchequer at Carlifle.
— 
The college was founded In 1340, for one provoft and twelve fellows ; to be chofen from the counties of 
"W^morland and Cumberland.
But the principal benefaftrefs of this noble foundation, was Queen 
?hllippa,f from whom It was called Queen’s college.
At prefent, the college confifts of a provoft, 
fixteen fellows, tw'o chaplains, eight taberdars,^ (fo called from the taherdurn, a (hort gown or cloke,

To thefe we may add 
eight fellowfhips and four fcholarfiiips, founded by the noble legal}' of a Mr. Mitchell of Richmond.
In the archives of the college, there is an indenture, in the Prench language, between the prcvofl and 
fcholars on one part, and John, the brother and heir of Robert Egglesfield, on the other part.
By this 
indenture, the faid John de Egglesfield is difeharged from all actions of debt on the part of the college, on 
condition that he and his heirs fiiall rtleafe to the provoft and fcholars, or their fuccefibrs.

of the faid John, was feixed ; and alfo pay to the faid provoft and fcholars, or their fucceftors, within 
two years, the fum of forty marks.
This inftrument is dated at Rcnwick, on the fcaft of St. Margaret, 
the 29th of King Edward III.
It ihould feem, then, that though Robert Egglesfield granted his property to the college, there had 
been foine informality, or fome defedt of law, which rendered it necclfary, that the heir ftiould re -grant, 
or at leaft concur in, and confirm, the former grant to the fociety.
In his ftatutes, Robert Egglesfield dircdls, that, in the cledfion of fcholars or fellows, efpeclal regard 
ftould be had to ihofe of his own kindred.
Few claims have been advanced on this ground.
In the 
year 1430, there was a Thomas Egglesfield prodtor of the univerfity : and afterwards provoft of the 
college, and Redtor of Giayftock, in Cumberland ; though he does not appear to be mentioned in tlie lift' 
of incumbents of that parifh, publifhed by Burn and Nicolfon.
Moft probably he was of this family.
— » 
In the year 1632, there was a Gawin Fgglesfield, A.
M. who, in an cledtiori of fellows, had been fet 
afide.
He appealed to the Archbiftiop of York, the vifitor of the college ; and claimed to be chofen, 
among other reafons, as being kinfman to the founder.
This claim was fupported no otherwife, than by 
a certificate from fome Cumberland gentlemen, that this Gawin was fon to Mr. George Egglesfield, 
gentleman, a younger brother of the Egglesfields of Dearham-Hall : where the founder, by fiicceffive re- 
lation, was a younger brother born ; and that his anceftors, both by name, arms, houfe, and blood, had 
Ircen owners of the faid Dearham-FIall, long time before the faid founder’s days, as is warranted by 
ancient evidences ready to be produced : and that the pofterity of the fame name, blood, &c.
then enjoyed 
the faid Dearham-Hall, viz.
Mr. John Egglesfield, fon and heir to the complainant’s father’s eldeft; 
brother, who.
In right of inheritance, pofiefted the faid houfe and manor.
The complainant added, that, 
at his entrance, he was acknowledged to be of kin to the founder ; and that, on that account, he was 
admitted contrary to the manner ordinarily ufed.
There was, at the fame time, another appellant, of the name of Blaync.
The archbifhop is faid to 
taken their parts; but with no fuccefs as to their’ ^fm for fellowftkips.
However, out of rel^eft 
ffoKs grace, the college gave Egglesfield the next prefentatlon to the redlory of Wefton.

his Grace of York, the Bifliop of Carlille tells him, that Egglesfield was ever a dull.

By the dI.-e<aion of the founder, die arms of the college are three fpread eagles.
Moft probably tliefe 
were the arms of his family ; which is fome proof, that the name was then fiippofed to be derived from the 
rnghfii word eagle, or French atgle; and that it was not, as fome have Imagined, from their having- held

This carol, fays Mr. Wavton, to whom we are indebted for this curious quotation, is retained at 
Queen’s college in Oxford, though with many innovations.
There is indeed in the college an old legend, that a wild boar, which infefted the neighbourhood of 
Oxford, was killed by a taberdar of this college on Chriftmas-day, as he was going to feij'e a church ; 
and that he killed it by thruaing his Ariftotle down the throat of tlie animal; protecting his'arm in th# 
rencontre with fome part of his gown.
This ftory, it is probable, may have contributed to the continuance 
of the ceremony of the boar’s head at Queen's, longer than any where elfe : but the fong has no allufion 
to it.
That fimply ftates, that the boar’s head is » the rareh difh in all this land and that it has 
been provided “ in honour of the King of Blifs.” Tliere is however a fong on this fuppofed feat of the 
taberdar, written by the prefent Dr. Harrington of Bath, and printed in the Qxford Laufage ; fo full of 
wit and humour, that we affure ourfelves, our readers will not be difpleafed to find it in a note annexed 
to this article.f 
It is imagined that, including the povoft, fellows, expedant mafters, taberdars, and fcholars, the 
foundation confifis, on an average, of about fifty members : that about four in a year are admitted 
fcholars: that they come, in nearly equal numbers, from the two counties: and that of thofe who arc 
admitted fcholars, about one in three becomes a fellow.
If this were all the emolument refulting from 
this foundation, its accumulated amount in the courfe of three centuries mull have been immenfe; audits' 
Importance to thefe remote counties beyond all calculation.
’ 
It is much to be lamented, that of this unparalleled benefador, fo little is now known.
Enough 
however is known to convince us, that he was the zealous friend of virtue and learning ; that his judg- 
ment was equal to his piety ; and that his liberality was unbounded.
How highly he was efteerned by 
thofe great princes, the third Edward and his illuftrlous confort, the ample aid which they afforded him 
towards the completion of his favourite projed, at a time too when the royal treafury was exhaiifted by 
continual wars, fufficiently evinces.

PARISH OF BROMFIELD 
Sir Wilfrid Lawfon, ftands near the centre of the manor, with a park adjoining.
He purchafed the tenants’ lands, and made them part of the demefne.
THE PARISH OF BROMFIELD.* 
T his parifh is remarkable for lying in two of the five wards, into which the 
whole county is divided.
The village of Blencogo is the line of divifion: 
Blencogo, and that part of the parifii lying to the ealtward of Blencogo, being in 
Cumberland ward; whilft all to the weft of it is in Allerdale below Derwent.
— 
The parifli is nearly, if not quite, ten miles in length from eaft to weft ; lying all 
along in a line parallel to the Solway Frith, from which it is feparated only by the 
parilh of Abbey Holme; excepting at Allonby, where the Frith is one of its 
boundaries.
Its breadth no where exceeds three or four miles ; and in fome parts, 
it feems to be hardly two.
Its northern boundary is Holme Cultram : on the eaft 
it is bounded by the barony of Wigton, and by the conflux of the two rivulets, or 
court of Edward, it feems never to have been employed for the purpofes of private emolument, or felf- 
aggrandlfement.
What he received from the crown, he gave to the public ; and he gave it in his life- 
time.
Retired from fcenes of fplendour and military preparation, he was contented to fpend the evening 
of his days in the fuperintendence of the family he had adopted ; and to be buried at the expcnce of that 
fociety, which owed its own fupport to his bounty.
In conformity to the motto he aflumed for his new eftablifhment, Regina erunt mitricei tua, he re- 
commended it to the proteftlon and patronage of the queens confort of England.
Nor has this recom- 
mendation been made in vain.
Befides the royal miftrefs of the founder, the college reckons amongft its 
benefadlors other queens, not lefs eminent for their virtues, than for their rank.
It reckons Henrietta 
Maria, Caroline, and Charlotte.
If from this houfe have proceeded men who, in various parts of our hiftory, and in different depart- 
ments and fituations, have ferved the public ; men dilHnguiffied in the cabinet or in the field ; lights of the 
church, or guardians of the laws ; whilft we produce the fadl, as a proof that thefe inftitutionsare neither 
pernicious nor ufelefs, we cannot but feel an anxiety to have it admitted, that fome refpeft is due to the 
memory of a man, who, though born in a dark age, and in an ohfeure corner of the world, had doubtlefs 
an elevated mind ; and underftood the heft purpofe of life, viz.
living to promote the heft intereft of man- 
kind.
The inhabitants of thefe northern counties at leaft ffiould remember (what, we fear, fome of them 
are but too willing to forget) that the natives of Cumberland and Weftmorland were felefted as the 
objefts of Egglesfield’s bounty, not becaufe he himfelf was born in one of-thofe counties, but — “ propter 
patria vafiationem.

Blefied be God, the times arc changed : and the fun of cultivation and knowledge has at length fhone 
even on thefe dreary regions.
_Jn no part of the kingdom Is fchool-learning more fedulouffy attended to, 
or more fuccefsfully profecuted3i^3», in general, it is in thefe counties : nor is the fafety of perfons and 
property any where more firmly eftablifoed.
Still, we ought not to forget thofe to whom, under Provi- 
dence, we Hand indebted for light, liberty, and legal fecurity ; nor who they were who fo largely contri- 
buted to difpel the darknefs, and alTuage the ferocity of an unlevered and barbarous age.
The compilers of this hiftory are free to declare it as their opinion, that, when the charafters of thofe 
worthies, to whom Cumberland has gi^en birth, fliall be duly appreciated, and their comparative excellencies 
afeertained, one of the firft names in theforder of merit will of Robert Egglesfield.

nurfc and fupport it in its beginnings, this fifltcry has not yet fucceeded fo well, 
as there is every reafon to hope it certainly will, in fome more propitious aera.
— 
Inftead of improving, it is faid to have declined of late: owing, in fome degree, 
to an extraordinary circumflance in the natural hiftory of the herring, w'hich w^e 
do not remember to have feen elfewhere noticed.
After remaining in this channel 
ten years, the wonderful fhoals of this fifli are faid to leave it ; to ftay away ten 
years; and then return, and ftay ten years longer.
Their revolutions are deferibed 
to be as regular as thofe of any of the planets, the flow'ing of the tides, or the 
viciftitudes of the feafons.
Unaccountable as this circumftance confeftedly is, it 
is confidently affirmed, and by very credible authority, to be a ladl; and to have 
been obferved of the herring for three fucceffivc periods yet w ithin memory.
Modern writers have related, on the ftrength only, it is probable, of tradition, 
that this place was firft fo named from Alan, the fecond Lord of Allerdale ; who, 
being a melancholy man, was plcafcd with the lonely fituation of the place; which 
was ftill more recommended to him by its vicinity to the abbey of the Holme, 
which he had undertaken to rebuild.
He gave it to fome of his kindred, who are 
faid, as it were in return for his having given his name to the place, to have taken 
theirs from it, and to have been called De Alanby.
At the length, the male line of 
thefe He Alanby s having failed, one of their daughters and coheireftes was married 
to William Flemby : fiom whom, by a daughter alfo, it next came to the 
Blennerhafiets ; and continued in that family, till about the beginning of the pre- 
fent century, when the manor was fold to William Thomlinfon, Efq. of Blencogo, 
whofe great grandfon is its prefent proprietor.
The tenants are about forty in 
number, all freehold, paying only a fmall quit-rent to the lord.
Allerdale itfclf, how'ever, as well as this its lord, Allan, are probably derivative 
names from the contiguous little river Line, or Ellen; which, like lundry congenial 
names, in Germany in particular, of ftreams of water, got its name from thQalni, 
or alder-trees, * with which its banks may be fuppofed to have abounded.
“ Ellennm ad Alms pertinet," fays Keyfler in his “ Antiquitates SeledltC 
“ Septenlrionales," p.
76.
Trees in general, and this tree in particular, were fo 
refpeded by our remote anceftors, that, as we alfo learn from Keyfler, it was 
deemed impious to cut one of them down, (” nifi fiexis Cenubus ac pravHs Preci-

another.
Flence Allen, and fometimes Hallen, meaning at firft only a place noted 
for alders, or ellars, became a pretty common name of towns and villages : and 
Nether-Hall, a feat of Mr. Senhoufe’s on the Elne, if ancient, like Alneboroiigh, is 
to be derived, not from the two modern words nether and ball, but from Neha, 
(afterwards metamorphofed into Nehelenna) a topical deity,* the goddefs of the 
ftreams, and this old word alien ; or elfc alh, the radix of hall, which originallv 
meant a temple.
Next to ham and ton, by is one of the raoft common terminations 
of the names of places, at leaft in Cumberland.
By, in the Iflandic ; and bya, in 
the Saxon, lignify to live ; and hence bye and hycing, a dwelling: and the common 
words bide and abide.
But by alfo may, and no doubt lometimes does, denote 
merely juxta-pofition ; and fo is fynonymous with the prepofitions nigh or near.
Hence, it the name oi Jlllonby were modern, it would fignify merely a place near 
the Elne.
Allonby was formerly inhabited chiefly by Quakers, who flill have a finall 
meeting-houfe there: but the members of this feA feem to be declining at Allonby.
They do not now, in this whole parith, exceed one hundred ; nor are there in the 
pariih more than twenty dilTenters of any other denomination.
The number of 
inhabitants in Allonby is fuppofed, at this time, to be 320.

In 1743, the Rev. Dr.
Thomlinfon, RecT:or of Whickham, and a Prebendary of 
St. Paul’s cathedral in London, (being one of the Thomlinfons of Blencogo) 
offered to aflift the inhabitants of the place, in conlideration of their great diflancc.
from t’neir pariflr church, to build a chapel on a piece of walte ground, to be given 
for the purpofe by his brother, as lord of the manor.

-)  This village has the.honour of having given birth to Captain Jofeph HuJdart ; a gentleman well known 
in the commercial and fclentific world.
It is not pretended, that It is, In any refped, particularly credit- 
able to him, to have been born of low parentage; but it certainly is no diferedit to him.
He was brought 
up to one of the moll: ordinary mechanic trades ; which, however, foon after his becoming a married 
man, he quitted, and commenced a n.^ierman.
After a few years fpent in that hard fervice, he went to

friends, other than bis extraordinary merit foon procured him, he gradnrdly rofe to the refpeftable ftation 
of commanding a ftilp in the fervice of the HonouraLle the Eall India Company.
In this capacity, he 
has performed three or four voyages ; and is now retired in plentiful, if not opulent, circumftances, moft

It' is, no doubt, highly honourable to him, — but w’e are far from confidering it as

It is in length eighteen yards, and in breadth feven yards and 
one foot ; containing thirty-one pews, befides a large one for the lord of the 
manor (who prefcnts to the chapel) another for the curate, and another for the 
clerk.
It was confecrated by Bifhop Fleming in 1745 ; and, at Dr. Thomlinfon’s 
requeft, dedicated to Chrifl: ; the faid Dr. Thomlinfon and his heirs being decreed 
its patrons.
Over the door (now lately placed at the north end of the chapel, 
intend of the weftern fide, as it formerly was) is this infeription : This chapel 
“ was built by the Rev. Dr.
Thomlinfon, Redtor of Wickham, and Prebendary of 
St. Paul’s, London, 1744.” Soon after the confecration, the faid Bilhop 
Fleming certified it to the governors of Queen Anne’s bounty at 7I.
per annum,

for the fears, and 2I.
for the houfe, liable, garden, and chapel-yard.
In 
ronfcquencc of this, and alfo of 200I.
given by Dr. Thomlinfon, it was augmented ; 
and the whole 400I.
laid out on the eflate of Soulhern-field-Hall in Holme 
Cultram, which therefore is fubjedled for ever to a rent-charge of 16I.
per annum.
A donation of lool.
by Mrs. Thomlinfon, the relied of Dr. Thomlinfon, was, 
in 1755, laid out, in the name of Dr. Waugh, then chancellor of the diocefe, in 
fome lands in Blencogo, called Warton- Dykes, for the ufe of the fchool : the 
curate of the chapel being obliged to teach a fchool, in a neat fchool-houfe, 
adjoining to the chapel, built, in fome meafure, by contributions ; and lately put 
into very complete repair by the prefent curate; who has alfo totally new-built 
the dwelling-houfe.
Another augmentation has alfo been received from the governors of Queen 
Anne’s bounty ; which has lately been laid out to great advantage, in the purchafe 
of fome lands near Carlifle.
West-Newton (fo called, it is probable, in contra-difiindlion to Newton ArloJIo^ 
in the parifii of Hohne Cultrnm, which lies to the eaft) is the next townfliip in this 
parilh, two miles eaft from Allonby, and a mile north from Hayton ; and is now 
the manor of the lurviving coheirefs of the Mufgraves of Hayton, who, in 1769, 
was married to William Jolliffe, Efq. Member of Parliament for Petersfield, in 
the county of Southampton.
Weft-New'ton w'as at firft one entire manor (whereof 
Allonby was parcel) and was granted by the above-named Alan^ fecond Lord of 
Allerdale, to Odard de fVigton, who gave it to Ketel, his fourth Ibn, the father of 
Adam de Newton, who firft took that name.
And it is obvious to remark on it, that 
there is hardly a county in the kingdom, which has not one or more places called 
Newton: more than one hundred Newtons are enumerated in Sir Henry Spelman’s 
Villcire Anglicum.
The families bearing this name are innumerable.
If the 
defignation of names was intended, as no doubt it was, to be charadleriftical of the 
places and perfons to w’hich they were allotted, we cannot beftow any very lavifh 
encomiums on the fagacity of our anceftors, on the fcore of their prediledion for 
this epithet new, w’hich could be particularly fuitable and appropriated only to 
their owm times, and be, as the Roman hiftorian exprelTes it, but '* Res unius 
“ eelatis." 
This Adam de Newton is faid to have been fucceeded by a brother named 
Richard ; who appears to have given fome lands at Newton to the abbey of 
Holme Cultram.
This grant to the abbey was confirmed by his fon, a fecond 
P P 2 Adam 
29 * 
PARISH OF BROMFIELD.
Adam de Newton.
This laft-named Adam had likewife a fon, whom (to return, 
• as it were, the compliment paid to his grandfather by his father, in calling his fon 
after his name) he called Richard j who alfo appears, afterwards, to have re-con- 
firmed his father’s grant.
Richard had a fon, whom he named Thomas ; and 
Thomas alfo had a fon, called Thomas: and here the male line feems to have 
ended.
For a daughter of the laft-named Thomas married Roger Martindale,* 
who thus became the proprietor of the manor of Newton.
In this family of 
Nfartindales the eftate continued for three or four generations ; but, at leng'h, that 
family ended alfo in daughters, five of whom feem to have married well in the 
county, which leads one to fuppofe, that their family was refpecftable, and their 
pofteftions confiderable.
Thus, among the knights’ fees in Cumberland in the 35th of King Henry VIII.
it appears that Cuthbert RatclifFe, John Blennerhaffet, Anthony Barker, Richard 
Dacre, and Humphrey Dacre, in the right of their wives, coparceners, daughters 
and heirs of James Martindale, held, jointly and undivided, the manor of Newton 
upon the fea^ (meaning, it is probable, Newton Arlojb) with the appurtenances, and 
the vill of Newton, (this IVejl-Newton) of the king in capire, by knight’s fervice,

feawake, and fuit of court.
By the like fervices, they alfo held 
fome lands and tenements in Langrigg, Bromfield, Meildrigg, Crookdake, KeldJtke,dLTid 
Lownthwaite : and alfo the manor of Ormejby ; wherever that was, whether in 
Yorkfhire, or in Lincolnfhire.
The inconveniences of this joint-tenancy led to a partition : and after this par- 
tition, one of the Mufgraves, who appears to have married one of the five daughters 
of Martindale above named, after fltc became a widow, came into the foie poffeflion 
of Newton.
For, Mr. Denton, who was a contemporary, fays, " Newton in Atler- 
** dale is now the inheritance of Edward Mufgrave, fecond fon to V/illiam, and his

commodious as the canals in Salifbury.
The capital mefiuage, or caftle as it was 
called, Rood at the weft end of the village: but as it was no longer inhabited, 
when it fell into the hands of the Mufgraves of Hayton, it has long fince been in 
ruins; and nothing now remains but the fragments of the ftiell of an old tower, 
and a dove-cote, which appears to have been a large one.
The demefne lies at a little diftance from the town, to the fouth-weft, towards 
Afpatria and Hayton ; and is now' one of the largeft, though by no means the moft: 
fertile, farms in the parifti.
Like all the reft of the parifli (the whole of which 
fcems hardly to contain wood worth lool.) Weft-Newton is ftill naked as to wood; 
but it is now w’ell inclofed ; and few places have lands more favourable to 
agriculture.
Mealrigg, or Meldrigg, the firft of the three townfhips in this parifti, with 
the fyllable Rigg in their names, is rather an hamlet than a town ; lying incom- 
modioufly on a north-weftern extremity of the parifti, on a fmall ridge of good 
land, furrounded with meadowy land.
Its name may be formed either of 
meal, or mdlder, (a Cumberland phrafe, meaning the oatmeal that is ground, and 
laid by, as the family ftore for the year) or it may be Mill-Rigg; fo called from 
fome wind-mill having formerly ftood there: or, like Maldon, in ElTex, it may 
formerly have had a crofs, which in Saxon is CDast; or the ridge of land may lie 
ao/swt/e, and fo, like Crofs-Field, Crofsihwaite, &c.
have been called, by two Saxon 
words, (Daete'o-jvig.
There is a fpaw here, fuppofed to polTefs conftderable virtues, 
which however have never yet been clearly afcerfained.
Langrjgg, the next townftiip, explains its fituation by its name; being a 
long ridge of land pointing eaftw-ard towards Brom field.
We are informed, on 
the authority of Mr. Denton, that this Langrigg was, originally, demefne of 
Allerdale; and was granted by Waldieve, Lord of Allerdale, to Dolphin, fon of 
Aylw’ard ; along with Applethwaite and Brigham.
In King Henry III.’s rime, 
this family of Dolphin became extincft ; and we find the place in the pofleftion of 
perfons named, from the place, De Langrigg.
In the 9th King Edw'ard 1 .

J There is a tradition, that the head, or chief, of this family had a grant of the lands of Gill, which 
were then very extenfive, to him and his heirs for ever, from one of the Scotch kings, the well-known 
William the Lion, whofe eventful reign lafted nearly half a century ; and who died in 1214.
This grant 
is fald to have been made, not only in reward for his fidelity to his • prince, but as a memorial of his 
extraordinary fwiftnefs of foot, in purfuing the deer ; outftripping In fleetnefs moft of the horfemen and 
dogs.
The conditions of the grant were, that he ftiould pay a pepper-corn annually, as an acknowledg- 
jTxnt ; apd alfo that the name of William ftiould, if poflible, be perpetuated in the family.

dyke; or, as dykes, inclofing lands, are of no great antiquity, from fome no lefs 
remarkable crooked aik, or oak.
It was, for a long time, the feat of a younger 
branch of the Mufgraves, of Mufgrave, and Eden-Hall.
Among the knights’ 
fees in the 35th King Henry VIII.
it is found, that Cuthbert Mufgrave, fon of 
Mungo, held the manor and hamlet of Crookdake, with the appurtenances, of the 
king, by knights’ fervice, and rendering tor the fame yearly 2s.

hands of the Sheriff of Cumberland.
At the fame time he alfo held lands in many 
other places.
This family of Mufgraves alfo, like mofi: others, at length, ended in daughters.
It was the Injunaion of the benefaftor, or the grateful requeft of the perfon benefited, this Is certain, 
that ever fince, till now, a Willia7?i Rcay has been owner of 1.

believe that the prefent John Reay is the firft Inftance of a deviation..

To many, it is poffible, the Injunaion, o?
the requeft, which ever it were, will appear weak.
Admitting 
that it was fo, it certainly was not wicked ; and, at the worft, was to be claffed only with thofe jocular 
tenures, by which many confiderable eftates have been granted and held,  ^tid, therefore, the prefent 
relater of the circumftance cannot but exprefs fome concern, that he has even this one inftance of devia- 
tion to record ; which, however, was not made without deliberation.
— William, the father of the prefent 
owner, firft confulted an eminent lawyer, whether he might fafely call his fon John.
The lawyer 
naturally and properly replied, that mere length of occupancy would quiet the poffeffion ; and make the 
title good.

It has before been obferved, that this eftate of Gill was formerly an esteniive one ; but at prelent it is 
fald to be worth about looh a year.

general, migrated from this parifli.
The before-mentioned writer in the Gentleman’s Magazine for May 
1794, flatters us, by coinciding with us in this opinion ; confirming it by other inftances, which, on liis- 
authority, we are hapny now to lay before our readers.
_ .
William Reay, Bifliop of Gla%ow, who, in the beginning of the fixteentb century, at his own expence, 
built the noble bridge there, ftill remaining, over the Clyde, wasof Cumbeiland parentage, and of this family.
The tradition of the family is not exad, whether it was the father or the grandfather of the celebiated 
naturalift, Joh7i Ray, who migrated from them : but, it is certain, that his name, and that oHiis family, 
was once ^^;l•itten Reay, and pronounced with two fyllables, like m real.
On their removing into the 
fouth before they finally fettled in Effex, they fometimes fpelled it Wrey, fometiines U ray, and at lalt 
Ray. The naturalift himfelf, it is well known, firft fpelled his name Wray ; but afterwards dropped thc 
W on the idea, perhaps, that Reay was but a local pronunciation, or provincial vulgardm.
And the icea 
was not ill-founded; for the name was undoubtedly intended to be charafteriftical and defcriptive 
of the perfon on whom it was firft beftowed : and the adive hunter, the companion and the friend of 
William the Lion, was called in the Saxon (which was then the common langirage) Ra, or paa, a roe, 
from his unparalleled fwlftnefs ; juft as the hero of Homer’s Iliad, from the fame quality, was called 
-rc'ixi ax.vi AviAAevj.
J roe is ftill pronounced ray in Germany ; as it alfo was m old Englifti.
It was in 
Cumberland, his paternal country, in his wanderings over Alfton Moor, and other equally wild and romantic 
olaces, that Mr. Ray laid in that vaft ftock of natural hiftory, which reflefts fo much honour on his name.
And here alfo he colkaed, from the fimple and unlettered inhabitants, thofe pithy proverbs or fentences, 
which, at that time, appeared to his friends in the fouth to be almoft a new language, and to proceed 
from a new race of people ; and which ftill render Ray’s Proverbs z.

Anne, the eldeft daughter of William Mufgrave, having married a Sir John 
Ballantine, who was born ai Carros, in Clydcfdale, and bred a phyficiah, Crook- 
dike became the property of Ballantines ; a family of note in Scotland, one of 
whom, under the Latinized name of Bellandenus, was the author of a learned 
treatife, entitled De Stalci, of which Dr. Parr has lately given a new edition, with 
a remarkable preface.
In this family of Ballantines it continued for three or four 
generations; when they alfo ended in daughters.
The prefent owner, the eldeft 
of two daughters of the lall John Ballantine by his Wife Caiharina Maria, a near 
relation of the Brifeos of Crofton, married Law'fon Dykes, Efq. a younger Ton of 
the family of D> kes of Warthole, or Warded (perhaps, quafi IVar^ or woi fe.
Dale) 
who, in 1773, had a licence from the crown to affume the furnamc, and bear the 
arms of Ballantine.
The manfion-houfe, which appears to have once been con- 
fiderable, is now gone much to decay, and converted into a farm-houfe.
One 
portion, or diftrift, of this hamlet of Crookdake is, from its (ituation, called 
Lozu-Rou,'.
Scales, a long, rambling, ordinarily built hamlet, by the fide of the common, 
is alfo diflinguinied as High and Lozv Scales ; a fmall portion of it being called 
Sandrazv, or 6 andy-Rozv.
Skells, or Scales, were the names given to thofe flight 
temporary huts, made in general of turf or foils, and which, in the mountainous 
dillricffs of this county and in Scotland, are called Beelds ; eredfed, moll commonly, 
during the border wars, to flielter and protedf the perfons, who were appointed 
to watch the cattle of the neighbourhood.
In many Latin writings of the times, 
the term is Latinized, and they are called Skalinga.
The term goes into the 
compolition of feveral other places and villages of the county ; fuch as V^Vm-Jcales^ 
calcs, Scale'by, ^S'crt/thwaite Rigg, Skeliou, &c.
Bromfield is a fmall, fcattered, but not unpleafant, village; and fingularly 
commodious for the fire of the panfh church, as being, as near as may be, in the 
centre of the parifh.
There is fome difficulty in afeertaining its etymology, from 
its having been formerly written fometimes Brunfeld, or Brtmsjield, and fometimes 
Brumfield and Bromfield.
If Brunfeld or Brunsfield was its original name, it may 
have been fo called, as Brtinfi'wic was, quafi Brunonis Ager, as the field, or land, be- 
longing to fome Bruno, or Brown, or perhaps, as a field or plain, w hich, from its 
heath or fern, exhibited a brown appearance.
If, like many other places and 
families in the kingdom, its firfi; name was Brumfield or Bromjield, we muff look for 
its etymology from the broom, or genijia, w ith which it may be luppofed to have 
formerly abounded.
The firfi public notice we find taken of the place is in its having been granted 
by Waldeive, firfi Lord of Allerdale, to Melbeth his phyfician ; whofe poflerity 
took the name De Bromjield.
Out of this grant the patronage of the church was 
referved; and given to the abbey of St. Mary’s, York.
This abbey, befides this 
patronage, alfo had fome lands here at Bromfield ; and fo had the abbey of Holme 
Cultram : and both being called by the general word, manors, it is not eafy to 
afeertain their difiincl pofTefiions.
It next appears, by the Regiftrum Holmenfe, that foon after the foundation of 
the abbey of Holme Cultram, Adam, fon of Thomas de Brunfeld, granted to the 
laid abbey the manor of Brunfeld ; the metes or boundaries of which are very

accurately dcfcribed in the grant, of which a tranfcript is hereunto annexed in a 
note.* 
It is remarkable, that after this grant made by the fon, Thomas de Brunfeld 
(father to the aforefaid firil: grantor, Adam) alfo grants to the monks of Holme, 
the cultivated lands in Brunfeld called i\orth Rig, wnth the marfh on the eafl part 
thereof.
__The terms cultivated land, which are a literal tranflation of qitandam Cuhuram, 
(a word of by no means unfrequent occurrence in old grants, and always fignifying 
fome fpccific quantity of cultivated land, in contra-diftinCfion to the w’affe land 
with which it w'as furrounded) in the grant, fugged a pretty obvious interpretation 
of the uncouth word Cu'.tram, dill annexed to the other names of Abbey and Holme.
3t feems to be, merely, an abbreviation, according to the very common ufage of 
the old engroders of old writings, of Ctillam Terram ; which, if written Cailt.
Terrain, 
is almod literally, and in pronunciation, diredly, Ciiltram.
And this explication 
of the word, like many others, leads to the hidory of things.
It fhews, not only 
that the monks were careful to obtain grants of cultivated land, but that the abbey 
lands, in general, were in a high date of cultivation, whild all the circumjacent 
country was probably little bet’cr than a wildernefs.
Henry, fon of the aforefaid Thomas de Brunfeld (a fecond, or younger fon, it 
would feem, and of courfe, a younger brother of the before-named Adam) is faid 
to have confirmed the before-mentioned grant of his father : and farther, in con-

Wc are next told, that Walter, fon of Benedict, who is called a prieff, (though 
no account is given how fuch a one came to have a fon) quitted claim to the monks 
of all his right and claim of common of paflure in the mai fli, which Adam and 
Thomas de Brunfeld had given to the faid monks, 
Agnes, daughter of Adam White of Brunfeld, carpenter, is alfo faid to have 
given to the faid monks five acres of arable land, and one acre of meadow, in the 
territory of Brunfeld.
This grant Thomas, a fon (probably a third fon) of Thomas 
de Brunfeld, appears to have confirmed; though no necefiity appears for his 
havino- done fo, unlefs it were ex abundanti Cauteid.
And from the lame motives, 
it is probable, his nephew, Alan, the fon ot his fecond brother Henry de Brunfeld, 
formally quitted claim of all his right therein.
Notw iihllanding all thefe precautions, it appears, that, in the 20th King

Hugh, fon ot the laft-named Adam de Brunfield, having a controverfy 
with the aforefaid monks concerning common of paflure upon the aforefaid

and at w hat times, each of them might, refpeclively, departure their cattle, without

After the diffolution of the monafteries, we find, among the knights’ fees in

that William Hutton held the manor 
of Bromfield of the king in capice, as of his manor of Papcaltle, rendering for the 
fame i8s.

Who or what this William Hutton was, does not appear: if he was 
of the county, there is no evidence, that any pcrfons of his name ever held any 
confiderable property in this part of it.
VVT are left to conjetiture, only, that he 
inuft have been one of the fortunate favourites ot the reforming monarch, who 
then unexpedledly came into the polfelTion of confiderable eftates ; or, pofTibly, the 
favourite only of a favourite.
Neither does it appear how or when he either 
acquired the manor, or parted with it.
On the 15th of July, in the fame year, the king grants to Thomas Dalfton, Efq.
among other particulars, one tenement in Bromfield, wifh the appurtenances, in 
the tenure of John Scurre; and one other tenement, with the appurtenances, in 
the tenure of William Scurre, late parcel of the pofTc-nions of tne monaftery of

Again, on the 25th of Augufl, King Edward VI.
by letters patent, in the firfl 
year of his reign, by way of exchange for an hofpital in Dover, granted to Henry

f This Henry Thompfon, it is probable, was the father of the fubjeft of the annexed biographical 
note, tratifcribed from Wood.
Thomas Thompfon, a very noted preacher in the time he lived, was wedded to the mufes in Queen’s 
college, in Machaelmas term, 1582, aged 15 ; made a poor ferving child of that houfe in the year 
following; afterwards taberdar: and in 99, fellow, being then Mailer of Arts.
About that time addidling 
his mind feverely to the lludies of the fuperior faculty, he became a noted difputant ; a fehoolman, and 
very familiar with the fathers.
At length leaving the college about the time he was admitted Bachelor of 
Divinity, (which was 1609) he became one of the publick preachers in the city of Briftow, and minifter 
of St. Thomas's church there ; where he was much followed and admired for his edifying and orthodox 
dodliine.
Afterwards leaving that city in 1612, (upon what account I know not) he became miniller 
in the town and liberties of Montgomery, in Wales ; where, if I miflake not, he continued till the time 
of his death.

There are no documents, it is apprehended, now to be met with, to fhew, with 
any exadfnefs, how this manor, and the great tithes of this rectory, were gradually 
parcelled out into various hands; and, after all, not totally alienated; in as much 
as the great tithes of the greateft part of the cultivated land of Blencogo flill 
belong to the Vicar of Bromfield.
The Porters of VVeary-Hall feem, at firfl, to 
have come in for a large fhare; Sir John Ballantine having, foon after, purchafed 
the denicfne at Scales of a Mr. Jofeph Porter; who alfo infranchifed many of the 
tenements.
The remainder, with the demefne lands at Langrigg-Hall, he fold to 
Ofmotheriey : and fuch tenants as Porter had not infranchifed, Ofmotherley now 
infranchifeci ; and then fold the demefne, as has before been mentioned, to Mr.
Barwife, in whofe family it fiill continues.
The demefne and tithes of Bromfield, 
neither of them confiderable, are now held by Sir Wilfrid Lawfon, Bart.: the 
demefne of Scales, and tithes of Langi igg and Crookdake, by Mr. Dykes, in right 
of his wife, the heirefs of the Ballantines: the inhabitants of Wefi-Newton were 
wife and fortunate enough to purchafe, for themfelves, their tithes of Thomas 
Simpfon, Efq. of Carleton-Hall, and Elizabeth his wife, one of the lifters and co- 
heirs of Chiiftopher Pattinfon, Efq.
; Allonby, Mealrigg, and Kelfick, fell to Mr.
Raincock of Penrith, in tight of his wife, another of the lifters and coheirs of the 
faid Mr. Pattinfon ; and thefe tithes, fince the death of Mr. Raincock, have been 
fold to the refpedlive land-holders of each place.
Whether the tithes of Blencogo, 
in this general difperlion of, and fcramble for, the property of the church, were 
ever offered to fale; and, if they were, why neither the then lord of the manor, nor 
all, nor any, of his tenants, became the purehafers of them, we have met with no 
evidences to ftiew : nor can we now fee why, whilft the tithes of the lands then in 
cultivation were referved to the church, thofe of fuch waftc lands as might here- 
after be improved, were granted to the lord of the manor; who has lately fold to 
two yeomen of the place all the tithes arifing from the lands that have been im- 
proved or cultivated, fince the dare of his grant; referving to himfelf the tithes of all 
luch lands as happen to be held by himfelf, and alfo of all fuch yet remaining wafte 
lands as may hereafter be improved.
Another yeoman of the place claims, and

has received and enjoyed, time our of mind, rertaia portions of tithe-hay, under 
certain circumftances ; granted to one of his anceflors, as the tradition goes, for 
having kept \vhat was called a lighl-borfe, during the border wars.
All the reft of 
the tithe-hay of the town, that excepted which anfes from the improved lands, 
belongs to the church, but is not, like the corn, taken in kind, being paid for by 
a very reafonable modus, of long ftanding.
Nothing can exceed the confufion 
occafioned by thefe different interfering claims : in as much as four different tithing 
men may happen to have a right to tithe one field.
The church of Brom field, like many others in the north, is dedicated to St.
Kcntigern, or Mungo ; whofe name, however, is now heard of, only as perpetuated 
by a fpring of pure water, clofe by the church, which is fiiil called Mungo’s IVell.
Rowland, in his Mona Antiqua Refiaurata^ thinks it probable that, in very diftant 
ages, churches were dwelling-houfes for the pntfts, as well as places ot uoiihip 
for the people; and that therefore they ucre generally built near a well of clear 
M’ater.
St. Kentigern, whofe name, in the ancient Britifti, is faid to be Kyndeyrn^ 
was the Bernard Gilpin of his age, and may truly be called ttie Apoftle, if not the 
Saint of the north.
He is faid to have been of royal blood among the Pieffs, or 
aborigines, of thole parts of the fouih of Scotland, which are now Galloway : and 
to have been Bilhop of Glafgbuy or Glafgow.
His w'hole life feems to have been 
devoted to the duties of his million, in propagating the gofpel ; fo that we need 
not wonder that he was called Mungbu or MungOy which, in the Pidtifti language, 
are faid to lignify, “ one dearly beloved.” His life was written by a monk of the 
name of Jocelyn ; from whence it appears, that he died in 6oi, aged 85 years.
This vicarage is valued, in the king’s books, at 22I.
: but it is now fuppofed to 
be worth I40I.
It is not yet quite twenty years ago, lince it was eftimated at 
lool.
: fo much has it been improved' by the prefent incumbent.
It Mas firrt 
granted by Waldeive, fon of Gofpatric, as aforefaid, to the abbey of St. Mary’s, 
York.
And that abbey had the patronage and ad vow fon of it, until 1302 ; when 
the abbot and convent, complaining of great Ioffes which they had fuftained, and, 
in particular, of 300 marks yearly rent, and 10,000 marks of mefne profits and 
cofts recovered againft them by the Earl of Lincoln, prevailed on the Bifhop of 
Carlifle to appropriate the redory of Bromfield to their monaftery.
Before he 
granted their requert, he ftipulated, that they fhould fecure forty marks of yearly 
revenue to the vicar there.
He alio referved to his fee the collation of the vicar, 
to recompenre his church of Carlifle for the injury w'hich it could not but fuftain 
by fiich appropriation.
And, from that time to this, the Bifliops of Carlifle have 
conftanrly collated to this vicarage.
In confequence of this adjuftment, both parties 
feem to have immediately proceeded to a^t upon it.
For, in the very next year, 
the abbot and convent nominated a proxy to Adam de Twenge, one of their 
monks, and Simon de Leiceflre, clerk, to negociate m ith the Bifliop of Carlifle all 
that was necelfary, and then to proceed to rake poffeiuon of the profits of the 
church of Brumfield for their ufe: and the fame year, the biftiop collated Ralph 
de Ailc to the vicarage of Brumfield ; and he, of courfe, is the ftrft incumbent on 
record.
Who w'as the immediate fuccelTor of Ralph de Aile does not appear: but, in 
PARISH OF BRGMFIELD.

1330, William de Suthwerk refigned the vicarage, in favour of William de 
Orrington, chaplain to the bilhop, vho thereupon was collated; a penfion of ten 
marks out of the vicarage being allotted to Southwerk, for refigning.
On a fuggertion, in 1339, that the churches of Bromfield and Kirkby Stephen, 
after their being appropriated to St. Mary’s, York, v\ere exempted from their 
form.cr fubjeFcion to the Bilhops of Carlifle, the then bifliop (John de Kirkby) by 
an inllrument figned in the prefence of a notary apoflolic, protefied, that it never 
was the intention of himfeif or predecelfors, to countenance any fuch pretenfions 
by any aft of theirs.
William de Otrington feems not to have kept this vicarage long ; for, in 1344, 
Hugh de Whitelawc appears to have been Vicar of Bromfield.
And, in that fame 
year, Roger de Kirkofu aid, a native of the diocefe of Carlifle, and then Redor of 
Morefby, in Lincolnfhire^ in the hope of better enjoying his health and friends in 
his native county, requefted an exchange of livings with Hugh de Whitelavve.
Hugh de Whitelawe, alledging that he was inclinable to ftudy the laws in the 
univerfity, and that he could not fo readily obtain leave of abfence from a vicarage 
as he hoped he might from a redory, readily confented to the exchange.
And their 
reafons being approved by their refpedive diocefans, the Bifhop of Carlifle, patron 
of both livings, accordingly collated the one, and prefented the other.
After poflefllng it three and thirty years, Roger de Kirkofwald again exchanged 
this vicarage for the redory of Crakanthorp : to which, being prefented by 
William de Crakanthorp, he was duly inftituted ; and John de Culwen, heretofore 
Redor of Newbiggin, was collated to the vicarage of Bromfield in 1377.
John de Culwen, it would feem, did not fit much at his eafe in his new living : 
for, in 1392, the chancel of the church being very ruinous, it was alledged, 
that the abbot and convent of St. Mary’s, York, ought to repair it.
To this 
allegation the abbot and convent, by their prodtors, Thomas Pygot, prior of the 
cell at Weiheral, and Alan de Newark, advocate in the court of York, anfv,ered, 
that the vicar, John de Culwen.
was bound to repair it; inafmuch as all his pre- 
deceflbrs were known, time out of mind, always to have kept the chancel in repair.
This plea, it is probable, was thought a good one, and admitted ; becaufe the 
repairs of the chancel have ever fince fallen on the vicars.
From 1392 to i 562, a period of nearly two hundred years, including the bloody 
contefts of the houfes of Lancafter and York; their union under King Henry VII.; 
the reformation under King Henry VIII.
; Mary’s inaufpicious reign, and a part 
of that of Llizabeth, we have no hiflory of this church, or its incumbents; or, 
indeed, any account whether there were any or none; and, if there were, what part 
they took in the eventful hiftory of their age.
From the time of John de Kirkby, 
or rather from Thomas de Appleby, who acceded to the exchange of the laft- 
named vicar, John de Culwen, to Bifhop Beff, who, in 1562, on the refignation 
of Sir John King, Vicar of Bromfield, collated Sir John Corry, clerk,, to the 
vicarage, no lefs than nineteen bifhops in fucceflion had the fee of Carlifle.
In two years Corry refigned, and Thomas Laythes was collated.
Thomas Laythes 
held the vicarage twenty-five years; and then he alfo refigned; and in 1589 
Nicholas Dean, M.
A. was collated by Bifhop Mey.
Nicholas 
PARISH OF BROMHELD.
po 
Nicholas Dean held it little more than half the time that his predeceflbr had^ 
when, on being collated to the archdeaconry along with the Rec^lory of Salkeld, he 
alio refigned; and his patron, Bilhop Robinfon, in 1602, collated Peter Beck, B.
A. 
to the vicarage of Bromfield.
How long Beck held it, does not appear ; nor, whether there were any intermediate 
vicats between him and William Grainger, who, probably, was of the ancient 
family of Newlands and Stone-Raife, and the anceftor of Mr. John Grainger of 
Bromfield, whofe daughter, the widow of Mr. Williamfon of Snittlegarth, now 
holds his handfome eftate there; and of whom all that we farther know is, that he 
was ejected from his living, during the ufurpation of Oliver Cromwell.
Walker 
fays, “ his family were thereby reduced to great neceffities ; and that fome of them 
petitioned for the charity of the corporation for minillcrs’ widows.” See his 
Sufferings of the Clergy, p.
249.
His fucceffor, Richard Garth, M.
A. was collated in 1663 ; and feems to have 
fucceeded to Mr. Grainger’s fate, as well as to his living; for he too, after the 
refforation, feems to have been deprived by the Bartholomew adf.
On the north 
fide of the communion table, in a kind of farcophagus in a niche in the wall, the 
following epitaph on him is ff ill legible : — 
“ Bromfield ’s pallor’s here intomb’d, 
Richard Garth, fo was be nam’d: 
“ God’s word to’s flock he did declare, 
“ Twice a day, and would not fpare.
** T’ inffru(ft the youth, help the needy, 
“ Vilit the fick, always ready.
“ To end debates among his neighbours : 
“ Now he lefts from all his labours.
** Rebellious fpirits he always did hate, 
" Obedient to the church, true to the ftatc; 
“ Now with heaven’s quire he fings 
“ An anthem to the King of kings.” 1673.
/ 
On Mr. Garth’s death, Bifhop Rainbow collated William Sill, M.
A. 
Whether Mr. Sill refigned, or died, does not appear: but, in 1681, the fame 
bifhop collated John Child, B.
D. of whom, on a brafs plate, in the fame niche in 
the chancel, there is the following epitaph : — 
Depofitum Johannis Child, Vicarii Hujus Ecclefiae, S.
T. B.
Cultus primi- 
tivi contra Papiftas et Sedarios Affertoris feduli.
Qui ncgledus vixit, ac Lastus 
“ obiit, in beatae refurreeftionis.
Tu vero viator, mortem meditari, et 
** ultimum judicium expedare, cures.” — The claflical Latiniry, as well as the 
pathos, of this infeription, renders it matter of regret, that we know fo little more 
of the charader, or hiftory, of the fubjed of it.
In 1692, John Prodor, M.
A. was collated by Bifhop Smith.
He was dead, 
before the compiler of thefe pages w'as born ; who remembers, however, to have 
feen fome of his books ; and from them he is led to infer, that he was a man of 
learning

This Mr. Prodor, reiiding in the parifh, feems to have taken 
his tithes in kind ; and, for that purpofe, he built a good tithe barn of brick, at 
Blencogo ; where the late vicar, Mr. Obadiah Yates, fince built another for the 
fame purpofe ; neither of which, however, are in the hands of the prefent vicar.
In 1714, Jofeph Rothery, M.
A. was collated by Bifhop Nicolfon.
In 1717, Jeremiah Nicholfon by the fame bilhop.
In 1733, William Wilkinfon, M.
A. was collated by Bifhop Waugh : and thii 
was, probably, his firft preferment ; as he appears to have taken his mafter’s de- 
gree, at Queen’s college, in Oxford, only on the i6th of June, 1715.
Mr.
Wilkinfon was a man of great learning ; and, early in life, gave an edition of fomc 
parts of the works of Ariflotle, which did him much credit.
And Henry, the 
third Vifeount Lonfdale, one of the mod; diflinguifhed noblemen of his age, 
rcfolving to give his nephews an education fuitable to their high birth, pitched 
upon Mr. Wilkinfon to fuperintend the fchool at Lowther, firlf fet on foot by his 
father, with an ample foundation, for the benefit of all the northern counties.
And, as long as Mr. Wilkinfon direded it, never was a fchool in higher repute.

time that John de Culwen was made to repair the chancel ; as both parts of tho 
building feem to have been erected at the fame time.
There are annexed to the 
chancel, on each fide, north and fouth, two old, unfightly, ufelefs, and inconveni- 
ent ere^ions, faid to have been burying-places to the families at Newton and 
Crookdake.f As no ufe has been made of them for many years, and as alfo there 
is little likelihood, that they ever fhould be ufed, and they look ill, and are great 
eye-fores and inconveniences to the church, one cannot but wonder, they have not 
been pulled down.
Above an old arched tomb, or through^ in a niche in the north wall within the 
church, is inferibed, in the old black letter, 
" J^evc lies intomti’ti 31 tinre untcrtaftc > 
“ 'kfie toarrioj, SUant of CrocliCafee, &ntg5r, 1514.’'’ 
This Adam was, probably, the grandfather of the Cuthbert Mulgrave, hereto- 
fore mentioned as holding the manor of Crookdake, in the reign of King Henry 
VIII.
; and the wars, in which he was engaged, mofi: probably, were only border 
wars.
Whatever he was, the infeription muft be long pofierior to his death ; as, 
if even the language and fpelling be admitted 'to be as old as 1514, it is written on 
the plafier, which one can hardly fuppofe to have lafied two hundred and eighty 
years.
There is no difficulty, however, in fuppofing, that the mere lettering may 
be modern ; done, when the church was lafi plafiered, from a former infeription, 
co-eval with the date.^

There Is, indeed, no tradition of the kind ; but there is- much external evidence, that both of them 
are co-eval re-cre£lions, of fome older original edifices ; In which.
It is probable, before the reformation, 
fome prieft, or chaplain, more, immediately, conaefted with the refpeftive families, was , employed, 
occafionally, to fing.
mafies for the fouls of thofe interred within them.
And as there formerly was at 
leaft one chauntry belonging to the church, it Is alfo poffible, that one or both of thefis 'places might then 
be ufed as a chapel, or chauntry, whatever, they formerly were.

There is alfo in the church-yard, a tolerably neat and commodious edifice, for 
the free fchool of the parifh, founded in 1612 by Richard Ofmotherley, who was 
a native of this parifh- He left lol.
a year to be paid to the fchool-mafler, for 
ever, by the merchant taylors’ company : the whole falary hardly amounts to 16I.
a year.
A few years ago, four gentlemen in and near London, who had received 
ibme part of their education here, offered to fubferibe 200I.
towards augmenting 
the falary of the mafter ; provided only the parifhioners would contribute lool.
to 
the fame purpofe.
Owing to fome untoward caiife or other, nothing was contri- 
buted ; and fo the fubfeription came to nothing.
One of the fubfcribers, the late 
Archdeacon of Canterbury, is fince dead ; and the reft, who were all of them his 
fchool-fellows, muft exped foon to follow him and fo, too probably, this oppor- 
tunity will be loft.
A confiderable change is faid to have taken place in the public 
mind of the people of this county refpeding education within thefe few' years.
— 
Formerly, it was almoft univerfally the fafhion to have boys, who w'ere at all 
educated, taught Latin and Greek ; this is no longer the cafe: at Bromfield, Weft- 
ward, Wigton, and Sebergham, hardly half a dozen boys now purfue claflical 
learning; whereas, forty or fifty years ago, their number would have exceeded an 
hundred.
It is eafy to afk, what have country lads, who muft w'ork for their .
bread, to do w ith Latin and Greek : but not fo eafy to anfwer, W'hat may be the 
efteds on the country in general, on fo fudden and abrupt an innovation in fo 
material a circumftance as public education.
Leaving now the ward of Allerdale belo^so Dei^ent^ and proceeding on, eaftw'ards, 
about a mile farther, \ye come to Blencogo, the firft town, in this quarter, within 
Ciunherland ward.
. , 
The derivation of the name of this town fs confefledly difficult.
Every circum- 
ftance refpeding the word befpeaks an high antiquity; as hardly a fyllable in it has 
any affinity to any language now fpoken.
It is true, there once was, in the county, 
a confiderable family of the name of BlencOy or Blencowe : but there is no evidence, 
nor even tradition, of their having ever had any pofteffions at this place, or that they 
were fettled near it.
Belides, the iyWzbXtBlen is not uncommon in the beginning 
of the names of feveral places, fuch as Blenheim in Oxfordfhire, and Blencrake, 
Blemerbajfety &c.
in this county.
It is not, however, of very frequent occurrence; 
and what is ftillmore remarkable, is, that one feldom meets with it in the names 
of places either in Ireland, Scotland, or Wales ; notwithftanding that it is un- 
doubtedly a Celtic vocable.
Yet it certainly exifts there, though it be under fome 
different modification.
, One might perfuade one’s felf, that this Elen is a contrac- 
tion, of or Belifius, the Apollo, 'dr god of the fun, of the Celtic nations; 
and that, as applied to the names of places, k means funny.

In the church-yard there ftill remains a pediment, con filling of four or five quadrangular Heps of Hone, 
that formed the bafe of the crofs, long fince deftroyed : but there ftill is, or lately was, a ftone ftool,

be particularly applicable to Blencogo.
But a more natural and obvious etymology 
feems to offer itfelf.
Ba!a in Celtic, and Bal in Icelandic and Gothic, is a village 
or town : hence the numerous Ballis in the names of places in Ireland j and hence 
too fuch names as Balcarris and Balmerino in Scotland.
Ain^ in the fame language, 
is a wood, or woody : and nothing can be more natural than that Bal-ain fliould 
be contracled, or corrupted, into Blayn, Blan, BlanCy or Bkn, The gradation is 
obvious in fuch words as Ballantrae, in the {hire of Ayr, Dumblayn, Blantyre, 
the family name of Blane^ and our Blencogo.
Cogo is alfo from the Celtic goga^jor^ 
a corn field, or harveft ; and it deferves notice, that this place was anciently fpelled 
Blengoggon.
Oogo, or Gogawr, is a charadteriftical adjundt, pofterior, perhaps, to 
Bal-ain, or Blen and the whole denotes a copjy, or woody, village, favourable for 
corn.
It is no great objedtion to this etymology, that the village is now remark- 
ably bare and naked as to wood : there is fufficient evidence in the low grounds 
and molTes belonging to it, that it once abounded with wood.
In the Bailliage of 
Schwartzenberg, in Switzerland, there is a near little town zdX\tdi G<}itgmjherg: which 
undoubtedly is from the fame Celtic root, gogawr.
Or, perhaps, it may be thought, 
that the old, and not very uncommon, German termination, gouu, or gozv, generally 
rendered in h^Ltin gobia, and fignifying merely any rural diftridt, or place, by being 
more limple, is alfo more natural.
The firfi: mention made by hifiory of Blencogo, is, that, along with Wigton, 
Kirkbride, Ulton, Waverton, and Dundraw, it was granted by Waldieve, firft 
Lord of Allerdale, to Odard de Logis.
And it would feem, that it continued to 
belong to his poflerity for feveral generations.
For, we meet w'ith no farther 
notice of it, till the reign of King Henry VII.
Whether the late pofTclfors had for- 
feited it by the part they, or any of them, took in the contefts between the houfes 
of York and Lancafier, or by w'hatever other means it had been alienated, and had 
again fallen to the crown, we are not informed : it ap-pears only, that, by letters 
patent, dated May ift, in the 24th year of his reign, King^Hfenry VII.
granted to 
Richard Chomley, Knight, the manor of Blencogo, w'ith the appurtenances, and 
all lands and tenements called Blencogo, within the parifh of Bromfield'j with all, 
and all manner of commons, courts leet, and view of frank pledge, free-warren, 
and other liberties whatfoever to the faid manor and other the premifes belonging 
or in any wife appertaining; to holcf to him, and his heirs, by- fealty only, without 
other account to be made thereof.
In the account of the knights’ fees in Cbmberland, in the 35th King Henry 
VIII.
it is found, that Richard Chomleyp Knight (ponibly a<'lori of the above- 
named Richard Chomley, but, more probably, as^being alfo' called knighf, and as 
alfo it was only thirty-five yea-rsr after th>C grant, it w'as the Original grantee) held

How the family of the Chomleys becarhe difleized, or difpofiefred of this manor, 
does not appear : but, forty years after thislaft-named grant.

letters patent, dated 22d of March, in the jifl; year of her reign, granted to Walter 
Copingcr, and Thomas Butler, of London, gentlemen, (apparently, not Cumber- 
land men, nor, till now, conneded with Cumberland) inter alia^ the manor of 
Blencogo, with the appurtenances, and all lands, tenements, or hereditaments, 
called or known by the name of Blencogo, heretofore in the tenure of Richard 
Chomley, Knight; to bold to them and their heirs as of the manor of Eajl Greenwich, 
by fealty only, and not in capite.
Neither does it appear, when, or how, this manor was again alienated, and loft' 
to the above-named grantees: but the next account we have of it fhew's, that, foon 
after, it belonged to Richard Barwife, Efq. oi Ijlekirk.
For, in the loth King' 
Charles I.
June 26th, the faid Richard Barwife, by a grant ftill extant, granted' to

their feveral tenements, paying the ancient yearly rent, and two years ancient rent 
(and no other rent) after change of lord by death, and change of tenant by death, 
or alienation, doing fuit of court as before.
The grant alfo gives the tenants all 
trees, woods, and under-woods on their refpedlive tenements; with power to get 
freeftone and limeftone in their feveral grounds, or in any wafte ground within the

Conceflions of very little fignificance or ufe; as there is very little wood, 
and neither freeftone nor limeftone in any part of the manor.
We have not been favoured with the exaeft date of the conveyance of this manor,' 
by fale, from the family of the Barwifes to the Thomlinfons : but it w'a's fomething' 
more than a century ago.
The prefent lord of it is John Thomlinfon, Efq.
: and' 
if any manor in the kingdom be, or can be, favourable to the tenants, it is this manor 
of Blencogo; the cuftoms whereof are in themfelves uncommonly cafy and mild; 
and the privileges and prerogatives of the lords moreover have always been exer- 
cifed (at leaft ever fince the lordftiip came into the family of the prefent poflcflbr) 
with much meritorious impartiality and moderation.
It has already been noticed, that the Vicar of Bromfield is endowed of the great 
tithes of this townfhip ; that is to fay, of thofe lands only which were in cultiva- 
tion at the leformation.
The great tithes of lands improved fince that period arc 
claimed and enjoyed by the impropriators.
Mr. Child, the excellent vicar of the 
parifh, about the sera of the revolution, fuppofing that the great tithes of the im- 
proved commons, or wafte lands, were alfo included in his endow'ment, brought 
an adlion for them.
The caufe was tried at the aftizes of Carlifle; and 'he was 
non-fuited : thofe tithes appearing to belong to the impropriators.
Sundry fmall parcels and bovates of land in this townfhip appear to have been 
granted, at different times, and by different perfons, to the abbey and convent of 
Holme Cultram.
The land belonging to this town is, in every refpedt, (climate alone excepted) as 
favourable to every kind of agriculture, as any in the kingdom.
It is much in its 
favour, that there belongs to it a very happy proportion of natural meadow, which 
requires, or at leaft receives, no melioration, or mendment as it is called, either from 
manures, or culture t and it is ftill more in its favour, that it is, in a great meafure, 
exempted

exempted from thofe defolations fo often occafioned elfewhere by floods and 
tempefts : and its foil is fo warm and kindly, that harvefl: is generally earlier at 
Blencogo, than it is at mofl: of the neighbouring towns.
But, as we propofe to 
fubjoin to our account of the parifh a few general remarks on the general ftate of 
agriculture in it, there is the lefs neceffity for dwelling on particulars here.
The 
town, though pleafantly fituated, and with the great advantages of a light, dry, 
warm foil, and excellent water in great plenty, has this difadvantage, th^at much 
of the land belonging to it lies at a great diftance.
The difperfion and intermix- 
ture of the lands is alfo a great inconvenience : and though the w hole of it is now 
inclofed, the hedges are not only unfightly, but othervvife objecflionable, from their 
being fo generally what are called cowed dykes, i.
e. hedges not planted with 
quickfets.
The town alfo is, in general, but indifferently built; a great majority 
of the houfes being of clay, and thatched.
f 
Wheyrigg (fo called, not from whey, the ferum of coagulated milk, but from its 
having formerly been a noted paflure for young cattle, here flill called queys, quhys, 
OYwhys) is along, fcattered hamlet, of but one row of ordinary houfes, lying along 
the common to the N.
E. of Blencogo, and contiguous to Holme Cultram.
This 
town, as well as the adjacent ones of Moor-Row and Dundraw, are a manor, 
belonging to Sir John Brifeo of Crofton.
Moor-Row (fo called, from its being a row of houfes contiguous to a moor) is 
merely a continuation of Wheyrigg: and fo like Wheyrigg, that whatever might 
properly be faid of the one, would no lefs apply to the other.
Both of them are 
parcelled out into fmall eftates, or farms; few reaching tool, a year; and feveral 
of them occupied by their refpedive owners.
Dundraw is a flill farther continuation of Wheyrigg and Moor-Raw, with the 
intervention only of a flight bank, or defeent, that feparates it, by a fpace of hardly 
more than a quarter of a mile from Moor-Row.
— Sundry etymologies of the 
remarkable name of this place offer themfelves to our choice ; and it is not eafy 
to determine, to which of them we ought to give the preference.
If it might be 
thought modern, the name would eafily and naturally refolve itlelf into down the 
row ; as, in faff, the village is a continuation of the above-named line, or row, of 
houfes, down the brow.
On this idea, Lei[[en~Hall, another fmall village, on the 
fame line, to the eaflward of Dundraw, and in the parifh of Wigton, would refolve 
itfelf into the lejfer row,- or, perhaps, as there is a tithe-barn, or the remains of a 
tithe-barn, or laithe, flill flanding on the confines of the two townfhips, it might 
be Laithe" s Row.
Burn and Nicolfon, on the authority of Camden (which, no doubt, is high 
authority) fuppofc the name to be from Dundragh, an Irifh name, iignifying an hill 
of oaks.
To this we only have to objeff, that there neither is, nor ever was, much 
of a dun, or hill, about the place ; nor is there any other reafon, but that fuggefled 
f Three plants, which though not rare, are not very common, grow wild in the wafte cornerg of the 
ftreets of this village: thefe are, chenopodium, bonus henricus, or mercury, a '’ery ufeful fallad, as a fubftitutc 
for fpinach : the hyofeyamut niger, or black hen bane, which, though poifonous to men, dogs, and birds, 
does not affedl cows, goats, horfes, and fwine, being fo grateful, it is faid, to the laft named of thefe 
animals, as to have been thence called hog-bean : and the artemifia abfcinthiurn, or commoa wormwood.

by this fuppoled oiigin of the name, to lead us to imagine, that, like Bafan in 
Palaftine, Dundraw was ever famous for its oaks.
If it muft have been an Irifh 
origin, we would prefer Dun-derg, or red hill j the clay in the bank that feparates 
Dundraw from Moor-Row, being remarkably red.
There is a village in Somer- 
fetlhire, named Dwidr}\ which is faid to be fituated and circumflanced pretty much 
as Dundraw is: and hence, the etymology of the one is probably the etymology 
of the other.
Now the firft fy liable may either be dun, or dune^ which Camden, 
in his comment on the Cygnca Cauiio, defines “ Montem Sigiiificare” or it may be 
the Galic durin^ which fignifies a florrn.
Inftead of dragb, the irifli for oaks, it 
feems more natural and obvious, to fuppofe the latter fyllable to ht drach, a Celtic 
prepofition equivalent to our beneath, or behind.
Hence, if the name fiiould be 
thought to have originally been Durin-drach, it denotes a place beneath, or fheltered 
from, the ftorm.
If it be Dun-drach, it means a place beneath, or behind, an hill.
And, as the place lies in a valley, at the foot of a fmall hill, either of thefe fenfes 
muft be allowed to be very admiftible: and this conjecfture as to dradj being the 
Celtic prepofition is fomewhat confirmed by the word’s having formerly been 
written Dundrake.
Dundraw, as has already been noticed, was included in the grant made by 
Waldieve de Logis ; who is faid to have given it to his Ton Gilbert ; and that 
thence this Gilbert took the name of Gilbert de Dundraw.
To this Gilbert another 
of the fame name fucceeded.
And, after him, Mr. Denton fays, he had read of 
one Symon de Dundragh, in.
the 17th King Henry III.
It is not likely, however, 
that this Simon ever held this manor.
For the four daughters and coheirs of 
the fecond Gilbert de Dundraw did inherit his lands in Dundraw^ Crofton, 
Thackthw'aite, and Diftington: viz.
Cicely, the wife of Jordon Clapell, who gave 
her part by fine to William Cundall, in whofe right fucceeded Ralph Cundall ; 
Matilda, the wife of William Multon, who gave her part of Diftington to Thomas, 
fon of Lambert de Multon, Lord of Egremont, and her part of Thackthw'aite to 
Thomas Lucy, the fon of Alice and Alan Multon : Ifold, the wife of Adam de 
Tinmouth, who fold her part of Thackthwaite to Thomas Lucy, and of Diftington 
to Thomas, fon of Lambert de Multon: and Ada, the wife of Stephen de Crofton, 
whofe part defcended by the Croftons till the time of King Henry IV.
; thence- 
forth to the Brifcos, who yet enjoy the fame in Dundraw and Crofton ; and ftie 
gave her part in Diftington to Thomas Morefby and Margaret his wife, and to the 
heirs of Thomas ; and her part of Thackthwaite to Margaret, fifter of Thomas 
Lucy, and wife of Thomas Stanley.
It appears, that, in 35th King Henry VIII.
Robert Lamplugh held a moiety of 
the town of Dundraw, of the king, as of his manor of Wigdon, by knight’s fervice, 
rendering for the fame 6s.
8d.
cornage, lod.
feawake, puture of the fergeants, 
witneftinan, and fuit of court from three weeks to three weeks j and that Robert 
Brifeo held the other moiety, by the like fervices.
We have not been fo fortunate 
as to obtain any information, at what time, or for what confideration, the Brifeo 
family got the whole; of which they have now long been in pofTeftion : neither 
have we had any fpecific information as to any particular cuftoms of the manor > 
'which, however, .we know to be mild, and mildly exercifed.

The foil of Dundraw is a deep ftrong loam ; particularly favourable for beans.
Like moft of the villages in this diilridt (to which however Leflen-Hall is an 
exception) the town is but indifferently built; and, like the reft alfo, is parcelled 
out into fmall eftates, or farms ; on moft of which the owners live.
Kelsick, (a cald or cold Jike) on the north-eaftern boundary of the parifti, may 
feem to be the counter-part of Meal-Rigg on the north-weft.
Like Meal-Rigg,.
it is a narrow flip, or ridge, of fertile land, environed with moffes; both places- 
being, from that circumftance, almoft inacceftible ; efpecially in winter.
In fizc 
alfo they are much alike; and likewife in being both of them occupied pretty gene- 
rally by a fubftantial yeomanry.
It is remarkable of this parifti, that, exclufive of Allonbr, the number of its^ 
inhabitants has varied but little for the laft hundred years.

Remembering perhaps what had happened to King David, the attempt to num- 
ber the people of Allonby excited fome alarm in fome perfons of extraordinary 
penetration and fagacity there : and hence their number can be given only from 
computation; which, however, there is reafon to believe, is pretty exadt.
Men,,

Hence, including fundry houfes and 
hamlets.

hamlets, the inhabitants whereof are not herein enumerated, the whole population 
of Bromfield parlfli may be fairly eftimated at more than 1400.
That the people might more conveniently levy and gather their cefTes and their 
taxes, fome of the townfliips were long ago confolidated and united into little 
diRrids, called quarters.
Of thefe there are five in the parifh : whofe hiftory, on 
the fubjed of that great national objed, the poors’ rates, is as follows ; 
About thirty years ago, the quarter of Allonby and Weft-Newton paid to the 
poor 16I.
per annum: twenty years ago they paid 30I.
: and at prefent, on an 
average, it is 60I.
This is an aftoniftiing increafe; and not cafily accounted for.
The quarter of Langrigg, &c.
twenty-five years ago paid icl.
: fifteen years ago, 
they paid 20I.
: at prefent 34I.
Bromfield quarter, twenty years ago, paid 34I.
; 
at prefent 60I.
Twenty years ago, Dundraw and Kellik alfo paid 34I.
: at prefent 
55I.
Blencogo, twenty years ago, paid 81 .
Twelve years ago, this quarter had no 
paupers : at prefent, its poor cefs is 22I.
The above lift w ould fuggeft many refledions, had not this parifh already taken 
up more than its fhare in this Hiftory.
It appears, that, within the laft twenty 
years, the poors’ rates have nearly doubled ; which is the more extraordinary, as 
there are no manufadories in the parifh, and indeed hardly any other inhabitants in 
it, befides a working pcafantry.
Nor have they been vifited with any uncommon 
calamity ; or even with very hard times.
Taking both men and w'omen into the 
account, it is a tax of fix fhillings and fixpence per poll per annum : and, if rated 
by the adual rent of the land, probably, about nine-pence in the pound.
In 
Blencogo only, it feems not to exceed fixpence in the pound.
All, perhaps, 
that is neceflary to add, is, that the expences of the litigations are not included in 
this eftimate ; and that there are no box-clubs, nor friendly focieties, in the parifh.
Befides Bromfield, there are not more than three or four fchools, of any kind, 
in the parifh ; and all of them, (Allonby, excepted which has an endowment now 
worth 4I.
a year) are fupported only by what is called quarter-pence.
After fome 
pains taken to afeertain the amount, it does not appear, .that more than fourfcorc 
pounds a year are paid, annually, in this parifh for the education of all its children; 
thofe of fome condition excepted, w ho can afford to fend their children to fchools 
at a diftance: which, calculating on the prefent number of children, very few of 
whom are not, at leaft, taught to read, is but very little more than a fhilling a 
quarter for each child.
It will be obferved, that fifty or fixty are inftrucfled, 
gratis, at Bromfield and Allonby.
Of fuch ufe are free-fchools ; though no longer 
the objedl of public regard and patronage.
It may, however, well become the 
inhabitants of Bromfield parifti to remember, that it is not in this age only, fo 
diftinguifhed for charity, that benevolent men attended to the education of the 
poor.
The foil of the parifh, according to Mr. Houfman’s very impartial and judicious 
reporr,|| is various ; but, in general, favourable for corn ; but, perhaps, ftill more 
favourable for milk and butter; particularly at Blencogo, and its neighbourhood;

from whence conhderable quantities of butter and hams are fent to London.
In 
general, the cultivated land, one acre with another, lets for a pound an acre^ 
which, confidering that it is more than three hundred miles from the metropolis, 
near no flouriflaing fea-port, nor even a large town, and with no mines, greao 
works, or manufactories in it, mufl: be allowed to be an extraordinary price ; and a, 
fufficient proof of the real goodnefs of the foil.
Land fo circumltanced does noc 
let higher within twenty or thirty miles of London.
There are no very coniiderable eflates in the parilb : not more than two on three 
worth 300I.

Formerly, the owners of lands in Cumberland were, in 
general, the occupants ; but this is no longer the cafe.
One half of the land 
in this parifli is fuppofed 10 be now held by farmers : whofe farms, for the moft- 
part, are not large; very few exceeding an hundred a year; moft commonly, they-, 
are about half that fum.
Much has been faid and written as to the queftion.
Whether large or fmall farms are, upon the whole, beft for a country ?
and the 
queftion is ftill at iftlie.
Without prefuming to difcufs, much lefs to decide, it here, 
let it be obferved only, that a neceflary preliminary queftion ftiould firft be fettled 
with fome exaCtnefs, viz.
What are really large, and what fmall, farms?.
And, 
after all, it will probably be found, that, like that other often-propofed enquiry- 
refpeCting the preferablenefs of a public or private education, every queftion of this 
fort is to be determined by its own circumftances.
As fome boys fucceed beft in 
a public fchool, and others under private tuition, fo great farms fait one country 
beft, and fmall ones another.
— In Cumberland, it would fecm, the land hitherto^ 
in general, has been held in too Imall farms; but large farms are, perhaps, ftill 
more unfuitable to its circumftances.
A farm of about lool.
is probably tho 
happy medium.
Audit might be Ihewn, almoft to demonftration, that a maa 
jnay do better by renting, on fair terms, a good farm of lOol. a year, than by work- 
ing inceffantly, as many do, on a few cxhaufted fields of his own, worth about 
aol.
or 20I.
There are no dairy farms in the parifli, though the making of butter is one very 
eftential bufinefs of every farm.
The rents are paid chiefly from the fale of corn, 
butter, and hams.
Potatoes are produced with great eafe and fuccefs ; but the 
other articles of a more varied hulbandry are but little attended to; though the.
culture of turnips has lately been introduced, and with every encouragement to 
proceed in it.
About three-fourths of all the improved land in the parifh is arable 
and of that, nearly three parts out of four are annually ploughed, and fown with 
grain ; v/hich is, unqueftionably, too much.
The circumftances in the prelent ftate of agriculture here, moft liable to 
objedion, are, that large bodies of land in every diftrid are lying wafte and.
unproductive:* and, by paring the commons, as cottagers every where do, to

And, as there are no mountains, fq

procure a very indifferent turf for fuel (a pracftice the lefs excufable, where pit- 
coal IS fo plentiful) it is to be feared, many of thefe fine commons will foon be 
rendered irrecoverably bad.
Whereas, in many places, the quality of the commons 
is but little inferior to the improved lands: and here, where lime is fo convenient 
and 
monafterles, or conficlerable caftles : indeed, hardly a gentleman’s feat, of any great note or diilinftion.
— .
Hence, all that is to be remarked, under Antiquiticf, is, that, on feveral of the commons, there Hill remain 
clear marks and demonftrations of their having once been ploughed.
It is not eafy to fay, when or why 
thefe commons, which, one would think, never could have been equal in goodnefs of foil to the other more 
convenient lands then lying walle and untillcd, were cultivated ; or why or w’hen, having been once cul- 
tivated, the culture of them was difeontinued.
The tradition of the country, that Philip King of France 
having deprived our Kini; John of all his Norman dominions, (determined on humbling the monarch, 
and embarrafling the nation) impofed it on him as one of the humiliating conditions of peace, — that his 
fubjects (hould till no inclofed, or arable, land for ihe fpace of a whole year, def rves notice only, as it 
proves the general opinion to be ftrong in favour of a very remote antiquity as to the ploughing of thefe 
commons : for King John’s difgraces happened about 1200.
It may dclerve attention, moreover, that 
it is not peculiar to this parifli, nor to this county, to exhibit proofs of its commons having once been 
ploughed.
It is, furely, a fubjeCf that deferves invelligation : and the few following brief hints are, w'ith 
all due deference, fubmitted to public confideration, not fo much with the hope of being able to clear up 
the difficulty, as of exciting others, wnth more opportunities, more leifure, and better abilities, to attend 
to it.
Mueh of the furface, if not of the foil alfo, of the lands of this kingdom now In cultivation, has been 
materially altered, it would feem, from what It was fome years ago.
What w’ere then moffes, marfhes, 
and meres, are now fine meadows : deep forefts ate now eorn fields ; and there Is reafon to believe, that 
low lands in general, but efpecially thofe near rivers, are not now fo low as they were fome centuries 
hence.
V alleys have been exalted, and hills and niountaitK brought lonu.* It happened to the writer of 
this account to fee, about ten years ago, at Caen, in Normandy, a fpacious and noble canal, then cutting, 
with the view of faving feveral miles of cireultous navigation by the river One ; which meanders there In 
a very extraordinary manner.
This canal was cut to a depth of twenty-four feet ; and at eighteen feet 
depth, lying beneath three feveral fuperincumbent ftrata, of fine rich mold, gravel and clay, there was a 
ftratum of fome confiderable depth of mofs fo good, as to make peats ; intermixed with much decayed 
wood, and fundry large trees Hill quite found.
Thefe trees, in general, were oaks ; and feveral acrons 
and hazel nuts, flill entire, were found among them.
The people employed in fuperintending this great 
undertaking, eafily fatisfied themfelves, as many others do (for there is hardly a mofs in the kingdom 
where trees are not found, at a greater or lefs depth, beneath the furface) by fuppofing that it was a 
veftige of the general deluge.
Without entering into the enquiry, how far fuch forefts of fallen trees 
have contributed to the produftion of peat-mofs, and ultimately to the produdlion of coals (the bafis of 
which are undoubtedly vegetables) fuffice it to obferve, that the convulfion of nature, which levelled fo 
many forefts in fo many of the countries of this our northern hemifphere, muft have been feme dreadful 
hurricane, long pofterior to the flood, and, poffibly, long pofterlor to the commencement of the Chriftian 
Jtia The fact juft mentioned (to which many fimilar ones might be added — and fome In this parlflr) 
was noticed here, only to deduce from it this obfervatlon, that, from natural caufes, not very difficult to 
afeertain, low grounds, and efpecially thofe contiguous to mountaln-ftreams, are in a conflant and con- 
tinued progrefs of exaltation.
Every flood brings down and leaves fome portion of flime and mud.

“ A gieat quantity of plants,” fays Cronftadt, “ rot every year In our lakes, and are changed into mud,

and cheap, it might cafily, in a few years, be made not at all inferior.
The im- 
proved lands too are diftrellingly remote and difperfed: it is inconceivable of what 
advantage it would be to every cultivator to have his farm, be it great or fmall, 
lying compad, and at a manageable diliancc.
It is alfo a very material difad- 
vantage, 
DOW almoft totally dry every dry fummer, and might eafily be converted into fine meadow.
The Sea^ 
Merci at Blencogo, the Mire at Bromfield, and moft of the meadows in the parifh and the neighbourhood 
were, all of them, moil probably, lakes, when the circumadjacent commons were ploughed.
And, if fo, 
k follows, that our forefathers tilled lands, not as invited by preferablencfs of foil, but where they could y 
where there was no water, and but little wood in their way.
In the early ages, both before and after 
the conqueft, mankind, it would feem, -were no where very generally congregated into villages ; but fat 
down, like wandering Arabs, with their herds and flocks around them, in huts or cabins covered with 
branches, grafs, or briars.
Like the Indians of North America, they ploughed, immediately around their 
wigwams, juft as much as might fuffice for their dally bread.
Owing to the heavy calamity of our 
border difputes, this ftatc of infecurity muft ncceflarily have continued longer in thefe frontier diftridls 
than any where elfe.
Accordingly, we are not to be fui-prifed, if we find, on our commons, marks of the 
plough, apparently, much later than the reign of King John.
It will go a great way towards accounting 
for them, to obferve, as any one eafily may, that, in general, where a piece of common has been ploughed* 
there alfo one decries the remains of a fold, or fauldy made not merely to fecure the cattle, but alfo the 
owners of the cattle.
Beth the ploughed land, and the adjoin ingy2r«/(/, where both men and beafts retired 
for fafety, are ftill very plainly vifible, on a lifing plain near IVare-Brig, in the diftrlA of Dundraw j 
and on another correfponding one on Murtkt-Hill (quafi Moor-Clod ) lying to the fouth of Blencogo.f 
It remains now only to mention a cuftom or two of fome fingularity, obtaining in this parifii ; and 
which the rather challange our notice, from the likelihood there is, that, from having now fallen into 
difufe, they will foon be totally forgotten.
Till within the laft twenty or thirty years, it had been a cuftom, time out mind, for the fcholars of the 
free-fehool of Bromfield, about the beginning of Lent, or, in the more exprelfive phrafeology of the- 
country, at Fajiings Even, to bar out the majier; 1.
e. to depofe and exclude him from his fchool, and 
keep him out for three days.
During the period of this espulfion, the doors of the citadel, the fchool, 
were ftrongly barricadoed within ; and the boys, who defended it like a befieged city, were armed, in 
general, with bore-tree, or elder, pop-guns.
The mafter, meanwhile, made various efforts, both by force 
and ftratagem, to regain his loft authority ; if he fucceeded, heavy tafles were impofed, and the bufinefs 
of the fchool was refumed, and lubmitted to ; but it more commonly hajrpcned, that he was repulfed and 
defeated.
After three days fiege, terms of capitulation were propofed by the mafter, and accepted by 
the boys.
Thefe terms were fummed up in an old formula of Latin Leonine Verfes ; ftipulating what 
hours and times fiiould, for the year enfuing, be allotted to ftudy, and what to relaxation and play.— 
Securities were provided by each fide, for the due performance of thefe ftipulations ; and the paper was 
then folemnly figned both by mafter and fcholars.
The whole was concluded by a feftivity ; and a treat 
of cakes and ale, furnlfiied by the fcholars.
One of the articles always ftipnlated for, and granted, w'as the privilege of immediately celebrating 
certain games of long ftanding ; viz.
a foot-ball match, and a cock-fight.
Captaine, as they were called, 
were then chofen to manage and prefide over thefe games ; one from that part of the patilh, which lay 
to the weftward of the fchool ; the other from the eaft.
Cocks, and foot-ball players, were fought for 
with great diligence.
The party, whofe cocks won the moft battles, was as victorious in the cock-pit ; 
f Mr. Warton, in that firft-rate performance of the kind, his Specimen of an Hiftory of Oxfordftiire, thus accounts for 
sommons ha-ving been tilled even fo late as the reigns of Henry VII.
and VIII.
“ Inclofures may be traced backward to caufes operating in very diftant periods : to the rebellious barons in the 
*' twelfth century, who manumitted their vaflals, and gave them free land, in order to conciliate their interell againll the 
“ king; to the relaxation and diminution of the Icudal tenure in the reign of Heni-y VII.; and under Henry VIII.
to a 
“ national fpirit of lucrative improvement, and to the diftrihution of the monaftic revenues among the laity, vvho were 
rapacious in turning their new acceflions of property to the heft advantage, and who continued to break up commons, 
and cultivate walle grounds, till the praftice apparently tended to the depopulation and improvement of the peafantry,

vantage, that the roads in general in this county, and the occupation roads of this 
pariflt in particular, are fo very bad.
And finally, it is much to be lamented, that 
farmers far too often enter on farms, to which their capitals are inadequate ; to 
the great detriment of both landlord and tenant.
It is not a bad rule, that a 
farmer, on entering on a farm, fiiould have at lead three years’ rent to begin with.
The price of labour is certainly not low in this parilli : day-labourers earn from 
one to two fliillings a day, according to their merits, and the kind of labour to 
which they are put.
The wages of men fervants, employed in hufbandry, who 
are 
and tlie prize a fmall filver bell, fufpended to the button of the victor’s hat, and worn for three fucceflive 
Sundays.
After the cock-fight was ended, the foot-ball was thrown down in the church-yard : and the 
point then to be contefted, was, which party could carry it to the houfe of his refpedfive captain to 
Dundraw, perhaps, or Weft-Newton, a diftance of two or three miles ; every inch of which ground was 
keenly difputed.
All the honour accruing to the conqueror at foot-ball, was that of polTefting the ball.
Details of thefe matches were the general topics of converfation among the villagers ; and were dwelt on, 
with hardly lefs fatisfadlion than their anceftors enjoyed in relating their feats in the border wars.
It never was the fortune of the writer of this account to bear the bell, (a pleafure, which, it is not at 
all improbable, had its origin in the beWi having been the frequent, if not the ufual, reward of viftory 
in fuch rural contefts) but he well remembers when he gazed at it with hardly lefs admiration, than, in 
other times, others contemplated crowns and feeptres.
The Ifthmian games were celebrated in immortal 
odes' but it was not to be expefted, that either our age, or our villages, ftiould produce Pindars ; even 
our Bromfield fports, however, were fometimes celebrated in indigenous fongs ; one verfe only of one of 
them we happen to remember ; 
At Scaler, great Tom Barnxsife gat the ba’ in bis hand.

‘Tom Cenvan then pulch'd, and flang him ’mang t’whins.

One cannot but feel a more than ordinary curiofity to be able to trace the origin of this Improvement 
on the Roman .Saturnalia ; and which alfo appears pretty evidently to be the bails of the inllitution of 
the Terra Filius in Oxford, now likewlfe become obfolete ; but we are loft In a wildernefs of conjeftures ; 
and as we have nothing that is fatisfaftory to ourfelves to offer, we will not ufelefsly bewilder our readers.
The others euftoms alluded to obtained In the neighbourhood of Blencogo.
On the common, to the 
caft of that village, not far from Ware-Brig (I.
e. Waver Bridge ) near a pretty large rock of granite, 
called St. Ciithbert's Stane, Is a fine copious fpring of remarkably pure and fweet vvater ; which (probably, 
from its having anciently been dedicated to the fame St. Cnthbert) is called Hell'f-lVcll, i, e.
Haly or 
Holy-Well.
It formerly was the cuftom for the y^outh of all the neighbouring villages to affemble at this 
well, early In the afternoon of the fecond Sunday In May ; and there to join in a variety of rural fports.
It was the Village Wake; and took place here, it is poffible, when the keeping of wakes and fairs In 
the church-yard was difeontinued.
And It differed from the wakes of later times, chiefly In this, 
that though It was a meeting entirely devoted to feftivity and mirth, no fttong drink of any kind 
was ever feen there ; nor any thing ever drank, but the beverage furnlflied by the naiad of the 
place.
A curate of the parifli, about twenty years ago, on the idea, that it was a profanation of the 
fabbath, faw fit to fet his face againft it ; and having, defervedly, great Influence in the parifli, the meet- 
ings at Helly-Well have ever fince been difeontinned.
We honour his zeal ; but there are many principles 
and praftices in the place, which we cannot but be fony, he vvas not fo fuccefsful in reforming, as he was

LITTLE BROUGHTON.
(see page 255.) 
In this village.
In 1714, was born Adraham Fletcher; a man of fome celebrity, though but a 
tobacco pipe-maker, and the fon of a perfon of the fame occupation.
The father had a fmall paternal 
eftate ; on which, with his trade, he was barely enabled to live, and bring up his family, without their 
becoming burthenfome to thcit parlfh.
It is not certain, that his fon Abraham ever went to any fchool.
We mention It on the authority only of a common report, that, very eaily in life, before he was able to 
do any work, his parents once fpared him for three weeks, to attend a fchool in the village, where youth 
were taught at the rate of a fliifllng for the quarter.
If this report be well-founded, all the education he 
ever had that vvas paid for, coft three-pence.
By fome means <.r other h avever he learned to read : and, 
before he had arrived at manhood, he had alfo learned to write.
With thefe humble attainments to fet 
out with.
It does him infinite honour, that, at length, by dint of induftry alone, Abiaham Fletcher be- 
came a man of fcience, and a man of learning.
He was of a thinking, inq .ifitive mind: and, having 
taught himfelf arithmetic.
In preference to any other fcience, only bccaufe he met with a book of arith- 
metic and no other, for the fame reafon he applied himfelf to mathematical inveftigatlons.
Whatever he 
attempted, he attempted with all his might ; and purfued with unwearied diligence.
In the day.time.
LIFE OF FLETCHER’.
325 
he was employed in hulbandry, or in making pipes : and, at night, eagerly betook himfelf to work the 
theorems (which word he long ufed to pronounce theorems) on which, daring the day, he had been 
intenfely raminating.
Often has be fate up all night, delineating diagrams; to the ferious grief of his 
parents, who conf.dered only the apparent unprofitablcnefs of fuch purfuits, and the certain lofs of the 
lump or two of cannel coal, incurred by his lucubrations.
Hardly ever, even in the fubfequent more 
profperous periods of his life, did he afplre to any thing beyond a rufh-light.
The parents, contented 
in their ignorance, felt no ambition to have their fon pafs through life otherwife than they had done, in- 
the midll of hard work, and hard fare.
And, as his midnight {Indies, and abftraftednefs of mind, 
feemed not to them likely to qualify him either to work more, or to eat lefs, they thought it their duty, 
and, for his intereft, to difcountenance and difcourage his paffion for thebrems: his books and his (late were 
hid ; and he was double-taflced with labour.
It was this poor man’s fate to begin and continue through 
life his purfuit after knowledge, under almoft ever poffible diladvantage : yet difficulties* and difcourage-; 
ments feemed but to increafe his ardour.
We remember his relating, many years ago, with vail; ielf- 
complacence and fatisfablion, a device he had formed, by wdiich he flattered himfelf he fhould be pei mitted 
to (lick to his iludies without interruption, at his few Intervals of leifure.
He married eaily ; and his 
wife, adopting the opinions and maxims of his parents, was no friend to ftudies, wffiich appeared to 
her little likely to lead to any thing that might help to feed and clothe themfelves, or their children.
Over his houfe of one room, their was a kind of loft, or boarded floor, (in Cumberland called a banks ) 
which, however, had neither door, window, nor {lairs.
Hither, by means of a Angle rope, which he 
always drew up after him, he mounted, with his book and his flate ; and here he went through Euclid,* 
We are confeious our anecdote is but Ample ; yet It is not infigniAcant.
At about the age of thirty, even his wife began to be perfuaded, that learning, according to the old 
faw, may fometimes be a fubftitute for houfe and land, and confented to his relinquifhing his manual labours} 
and fetting up as a fclioolmafter.
For feveral years, he was a teacher of mathematics of conAderable 
reputation ; and many refpeblable young men were his pupils.
Still purfuing knowledge wherever knowledge was to be found, Abraham (now Mr.) Fletcher, became a 
botanift, as well as a mathematician : but he ftudied the properties, rather than the claffiAcation, of plants} 
and made many experiments to afeertain their medical virtues.
Few men, it is believed, have lately 
made a greater proAciency than he did, in this (now perhaps too much negleblcd) department of fclence : 
and he was foon qualifled to commence doftor, as well as fchoolmaller.
It is true, indeed, he prablifed 
chiefly, if not folely, with decodlions or diet-drinks : yet, with thefe, he cither did perform, or got the 
reputation of performing, many extraordinary cures ; and had no fmall pradlice.
To regularly bred phyAcians, many of his noltrums, if they knew them, we are aware, would feem 
Ample and infigniAcant.
Charlevoix, we remember, in his Hiftoiy of Canada, fpeaking of fome nation 
of Indians, naturally mentions their difeafes, and their modes of cure, which, like Fletcher’s, were 
attempted, chiefly by Ample preparations of plants.
And he adds on the occaAon, — “ All this, I know, 
“ will appear perfeftly ridiculous to the faculty In Europe ; but, they may permit me to make one obfer- 
“ vation only on the fubjeft, not undeferving of their attention ; which Is, that thefe Puvj-lVanuers of 
“ Canada perform as many and as difficult cures as are performed by all the medical fcience of Europe.” 
Dodlor Fletcher was particularly famed for his fldll and fuccefs in hypocondriacal cafes ; and, had he 
been as able to deferibe, as he was to relieve and cure fuch cafes, many things In this way are known to 
liave occurred In the courfe of his praftice, to which even the moft learned might have attended with 
advantage.
If our obje£l in thefe humble biographical ffictches was, only to v.Tlte panegyric, we Ihoiild fupprefs a 
circumftance In the charaftei of Dodtor Fletcher, which Dr. Johnfon, In his life of Dryden, has taught 
us.
Is little likely to do him honour in the prefent age.
Like Dryden, like the late Mr. Henderfon, of 
Pembroke college, Oxford, and like many other men of unqueftionably great abilities and learning, 
Fletcher put great confidence in the prog>joficaticns of judicial afrology.
And what is more'extraordlnarv, 
many of his predidlions were meotiderfully fulfilled.
In the margin of a book belonging to him.
Ailed with 
aftronomical calculations, an entry was alfo made of the planets’ places In the zodiac, at the birth of 
Abraham Fletcher of Little Broughton ; to which one George Bell of Cockermouth, about ten years 
ago, added the following obfervations.
“ This gives, in time, 78 years and 55 days.
Near this period Is a bad direftion ; It brings Saturnine 
“ griefs, efpecially fuch as proceed from cold, dry, and phlegmatic caufes ; and, if Saturn he Anretta, it 
“ threatencih death.” 
However 
326 
LIFE OF FLETCHER.
However unaccountable it may feem, the faA is, that Dr. Fletcher died, juft when he had reached 78 
years, and (not 55, but) 71 days.
The principles of the foregoing calculation are faid to be contained in the following fcheme, which, 
therefore, may be acceptable to fuch of our readers as underftand aftrology ; though we are not fo happy 
as to be claffed in the number of them.

ije, the direftion alluded to by Mr. Bell, is the afcendant to the fqnare of Saturn.
Thefe calcutions, with every thing that may be deducible from them, we willingly leave to fuch of our 
readers, as, like Mefirs.
Fletcher and Bell, may have been Initiated in the myfteries of aftrology.
Though 
Incompetent, ourfelves, to judge of them, we thought it our duty not to withhold them from our readers ; 
who, hence, have another opportunity of forming their judgments on the relative ftrength and weaknefs of 
the human underftanding.j: 
Whoever has read the life of Mr. Pafchal, as written by his fifter.
Madam Perler, will recolleft many 
particulars in it, not unlike fomething here related of Abraham Fletcher.
They were, both of them, 
diftingulfhed, in their refpeffive ages and countries, for uncommon knowledge ; and the great fecret by 
which they acquired fo much knowledge, was, that t/tey were tiever idle.
Whatever Fletcher was anxious 
to know, like Pafchal, he applied himfelf to the careful ftudy of it ; and never quitted It, till he found 
out fome fatisfaftory reafon for it.
It was much to Mr. Fletcher’s credit, that, with all his attention to mere Intclleftiial attainments, he 
never was inattentive to thofe duties which prudence had annexed to his ftation in life.
He was not only 
a pattern of induftry, but a pattern of oeconomy ; two virtues, which have been well called the hand- 
maids of fortune.
And hence he was enabled to leave to his large family not lefs than 4000I.
; 3000I.
of which were of his own earning.
By his wife Mary, he had Iflue two fons and eight daughters ; of 
whom only four of the latter are now living.
He died on the ift of January, 1793, aged, as is above 
ftated, very nearly 78 years and a quarter.
Biorgaphia Cumb.
Mr. Fletcher publlfhed a large mathematical work In 8vo, called The Unherfal Meafurer ; thefollown'ng 
charafter of which Is given by Mr. Jour* Howard, formerly of Carlifle, mathematician, (to whom wc 
acknowledge great obligation) — “ Of the merit of this work, when it is confidered how much has been 
done from fuch accidental, and.
In general, poor, refources, too much cannot be faid ; like the induftrlous 
bee, he has coUedled fweets wherever they could be found, and ftored them in his repofitory with unremit- 
ting affiduity.
And, if we abftraft from the diflultory manner In which it was written (the Inevitable 
confequence of the caufes already pointed out) I do not hefitate to pronounce It the largeft and beft 
colledfion of mathematical knowledge, comprifed in one volume, that has hitherto appeared in the Engllfti 
language : and from which, as a common-place, the mathematicians of the prefent day are yet borrowing 
materials.” 
J Whatever faith might formerly be placed in dedudllons drawn from fuch ambiguous principles as aftrological com- 
putation, one circumftance has lately occurred, that bids defiance to the juftnefs of all conclufions drawn from that fourac ; 
I mean the difcovery of the Georgium Sidus ; which, as it muft; of confequence have been omitted in all prior data, the 
refults produced from fuch premifes muft hitherto have been erroneous.

H ere was an abbey of Ciftercians, but there is now very little of the monaftic 
buildings; and but a part of the church, in its original form, is (landing: 
the parochial chapel was formed out of its remains.
It is faid, by feveral writers, that this abbey was founded by Prince Henry, fon 
of David, King of Scotland, about the year 1 150, and was dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary.* From the authority of Leland’s Colled, it appears, that Alanus, the fon 
of Earl Waldeof, was the firft founder; but, from the crown rolls in the time of 
King Edward I.
another fuggeftion arifcs, that it was a foundation of King 
Henry l.f There are circumflances which encourage this opinion, and that 
Alanus reftored the infant monaftery after fome injuries which it had received, 
and increafed its revenue ; and that the Scotch monarch and his fon were only the

eftuary is crooked, and Maricambe fignifies, in Britifh, a crooked fea.
Upon this 
is the abbey of Ume or Holme Cultraine founded by David, the firft King of 
Scotland.
But Vultsey, a fort hard by, was built by the abbots for the fecu- 
“ ring of their treafures, their books, and their charters, againfl: the fudden incur- 
" fions of the Scots.
Here, they fay, were long preferved the magic books of 
" Michael Scot, till they were mouldering into dulL He was a monk of this place 
“ about the year i 290, and applied himfelf fo clofely to the mathematics, and other 
" abftrufe parts of learning, that he w^as generally looked on as a conjurer; and 
« a vain credulous age has handed down I know not what miracles done by him.” 
Michael Scot was a Durham man, w ho applied himfelf to the abftrufc 
“ Arirtotelian philofophy, which he pretended to tranflate from Avicenna, and 
“ dedicated to Frederic II.
Emperor of Germany, whofe aftrologer he W'as.
— 
“ Some of his philological and aflrological works have been printed; and, Demp- 
" fler fays, fome remained in his time in Scotland, which his countrymen would 
'* not dare to open, for fear of the devilifh pranks that might be played by 
" them.”!}; 
“ The Holm Cultrum w’as a wafle foreft ground, replenifhed with red deer, and 
a demefne of Allerdale at the conqueft.
Howbeit, it feems by the charters of 
the abbey, that it was the foil and inheritance of Henry, Earl of Carlifle, fon to 
David, King of Scots, that died before his father, (for Malcolm the Maiden fuc- 
" ceeded his grandfather .David in the kingdom of Scotland, as eldeft fon to the 
faid Henry, and next heir to the king.) In the time of King Stephen, w hen he 
ufurped the Bate of England, he gave Cumberland 10 the Scots, to beafflired of 
their friendfliip: and this Earl Henry then gave two parts of Holm Cultram to 
** the abbot and monks there, and granted the third part thereof to Allan, the fon 
” of Waldeof, for his hunting there; which Allan, then I.ord of Allerdale, gave 
" inftantly the faid third part to the abbey as that which the faid Henry Fitz 
“ David had given them at the foundation thereof; and Waldeof, the fon of the 
“ faid Allan, confented to the grant with his father, which the faid Henry con- 
" firmed, and David and Malcolm aforefaid.
At the death of King Stephen, 
“ Henry Fitz Emprefs, the fecond of that name King of England, entered upon 
“ Cumberland, which King Stephen had before given to David King of Scots, and 
“ then the monks acknowledged him their founder.
He granted them, by his 
“ charter, Totam Infulam de Holme Cultram et Rahy, by their right bounds, W'i th 
timber and paBure in the foreB of Inglewmod ; which gift King Richard and 
“ King John, his fucceffors in the kingdom, alfo confirmed, with many liberties 
“ exprefled in the letters patent; without mention of any ads done by the Scots.

How much this abbey was regarded by the fovereigns of England, appears by the 
abbots being efpecially fummoned to the parliaments held in the 23d, 24th, 28th, 
32d, and 34th years of the reign of King Edward I.
and to one or more in the 
reign of King Edward II.
; for this was not a privilege due to them, as was the 
cafe of mitred abbeys.
At the dilTolution the monaftery was furrendered by 
Borrodale, then abbot, in the 26th year of King Henry Vlll.
it being then valued 
at 427I.
19s.
3d.
according to Dugdale, and 537I.

7d.
according to Speed.
Borrodale, the furrendering abbot, was maderecflor of the then inftituted redlory, 
inflead of receiving a penfion : he died in the firft year of the reign of Queen 
Mary.
The queen in that year granted the red;ory with the advowfon, together 
with the chapel of New ton Arlofh, and all tithes, profits, and emoluments, thereto 
appertaining, unto the chancellor, mailers, and fcholars of the univerfity of 
Oxford ; from whom it hath been conftantly leafed out; and is now held by Sir 
John B rifco of Crofton.* 
The church hath undergone many and fingular mutilations.
The deftrudlion of 
the monaftic buildings firll took place ; then the abbey fuffered under the hand of 
reformation: part of the facred edifice was refitted for parochial ufe.
In the be- 
ginning of the 17th century, during the incumbency of Edward IVIandevil, a very 
fingular event happened : it is fet forth in an entry made in the parifh regifter,

There was a furrey book made at the fnppreflion of the abbey, touching all things, pofleflions, and 
privileges belonging thereto.
In that book, the manner of tithing was fet down.
The abbot’s bufhel 
was eight gallons, for tithe of corn and meal.

“ fuddcnly fell down to the ground, upon the firfl day of January, in the year 1600, 
about three o’clock in the afternoon, and, by the fall thereof, brought dou n a 
“ great part of the chancel, both timber, lead, and walls; and, after the faid fall, 
“ the fame continued in a very ruinous condition for the fpace of two years, during 
“ which time there was mucji lead, wood, and Rone carried away.” Mr.
Mandevil and one Robert Chamber w’ere in the church at the inflant, and received 
no harm.
In 1602, under the influence of the Bifhop of Carlifle, the univerfity 
ifllied a commifTion to rebuild the chancel, and, in 1602 and 1603, Mr. Mandevil, 
at the expence of 180I.
and upwards, completed that work.
The church 
happened a fecond and greater mifhap in the following year; for it is ftated in 
the fame regifter, that the above-mentioned work being finiflied, “ It fo happen- 
“ ed, that, upon Wednefday the 18th of April, 1604, Chriftopher Hardon 
“ carrying a live coal* and a candle into the roof of the church, to fearch for an 
“ iron chifel \\hich his brother had left there, and the wind being exceeding 
“ ftrong and boifterous, it chanced that the coal blew out of his hand into a daw’s 
“ neft which was within the roof of the church, and forthwith kindled the fame, 
" which fet the roof on fire, and within lefs than three hours it confumed and 
“ burned both the body of the chancel and the whole church, except the fouth 
“ fide of the low church, which was faved by means of a fione vault.” A charge 
was brought by bill in the Exchequer againfl Mandevil, and Chriftopher Hardon, 
who was his fervant, for burning the church wilfully and malicioufly, but, failing 
in proof, the bill was difmifTed. Mandevil, at his own coft, voluntarily rebuilt 
the chancel, and the parifhioners repaired the body of the church, at the com- 
mand of the bifhop.
The church of Holm Cultram is a difeharged living, paying no firft-fruits, 
tenths, fynodals, nor procurations.
This church was vifited by Bifliop Nicolfon in 1703, by whom the following 
account is given : — “ The porch, on the weft fide, feems to have been built by

" The infide of the church was full of watcr^ the rain falling in plentifully every- 
where, The parifhioners, about fifteen or fixteen years before, took off the lead 
from the fouth aile (the arches of which are dropping down) to cover that on the 
north.
The fabric is large, though only the body of the church is Handing, of 
nine arches of each aile, and very high.” 
Dr. Waugh, during his chancellorfliip of this diocefe, fpeaks of it thus — “ When 
I firft came into the jurifditffion, I found both church and chancel in a moft ruin- 
ous condition.
I fent out procefs, &c, — they new roofed with lead the large 
middle aile, took away the fide ailes and part of the chancel, and made the whole 
one good building.
It is neatly and conveniently feated, with handfome galleries, 
and is altogether a beautiful church ; but, though it ftands high, Itrangely damp.
It contains feats for 846 perfons.” 
The manor belongs to the heir of the family of Stephenfons ; but when It was granted out 
by the crown, no evidence has come to our knowledge.
It appears that It had not pafled from 
the crown very early ; for, in the 12th year of Queen Elizabeth, a furvey was taken by com- 
miffion, and a return made thereto; which Inftruments, as they are material to the landholder, 
though they may appear tedious to our readers in general, we think it our duty not to omit :

faid manor at the next court there to be holden ; — but not by his laft will and teftament : and 
further, that no tenant may divide his tenement by grant or furrender.
And further, the faid tenants do prefent, that the wuves of every fuch tenant within the

A fmall part is now re- 
maining, but fufficient to flievv it was a place of great ftrength, with a broad and 
deep ditch furrounding it.* It appears to have been the cuftom in the northern 
parts of this kingdom, for the monafteries to have a fortrefs of this kind, in which 
they might lodge with fecurity their treafures and records, on the approach of 
an enemy : of this, the caftle on Holy Ifland, in Northumberland, and the 
Peel of Fouldray, near Furnefs Abbey, are examples.
This part of the coaft 
muft have undergone great changes; for, on the edge of the bay, in the 13th

within the boundaries of the Ijiand of Holme, fliall be a free borough, and the

But the calamities the borough had

and fair at Kirby Joan.
In the grant made in confcquence of that petition, the 
above-mentioned charter is rchearfed, and it is then ftated, — “ That the abbot 
had reported, that a great part of the road leading to the borough, and much of 
the borough itfelf, by divers invafions and ftorms were wafted ; and that the 
inlets of the fea were become fo deep, that people could not refort hither, or

Thus cut olT from all hopes of preferment at Queen’s, he retired to Cockermouth ; where he lived and 
died ; with the charadfer only of being an oc/J man.
On fome particular Sunday of the year, we luppofe on Rogation Sunday, he conftantly preached on 
the beauties of Flora.
On thefe occafions, he failed not to provide himfelf with a large bouquet of flowers: 
and, taking it in his hand, he difplayed it, with many fignificant geftures, to his congregation, as he 
pronounced his annual text, from the gofpcl of St. Matthew, — “ Solomon, in all his glory, <ix>as not arrayed 
like one of thefe.” After a forty years’ refidence in his cure, fuppofing his people not to be fufficiently 
attentive to him, he ledlured them in a fermon on this text, from the 95th Pfalm, — “ Forty years Iona 
have J been grieved nvith this generation.” We are not of the number of thofe, who think, that a fermon 
fhould never be perfonal ; which has fometimes been recommended, not very confiftently we think, by 
thofe who yet advife that they (hould be local : but Mr. Jefferfon was too often, too pointedly and 
injudicioufly perfonal.
A gentleman once finding Ijimfelf thus fingled out by name, and even pointed 
at by the finger of the preacher, very properly left the church ; whilft Jefferfon continued to rail.
On 
the ift of March, St. David’s day, he always wore a leek ; in token of his having been born, though by 
accident.
In Wales.
He enjoyed an uncommon fhare of health and fpirits till he was 95 ; affedling to 
be offended with any one who thought him old — always remarking on the occafion, that there was nothing 
old, but old boots and old fhoes, and here and there a chance old maid.
Till within four years of his 
death, he was remarkably aftivc and agile ; and would probably have continued fo to the laft, had he not 
unfortunately, when upwards of ninety, been lamed by a fall from his horfe : and, at the fame time, 
caught a dangerous cold, by lying out all night in winter on a common, as he was on a journey, to pay 
his addreffes to a rich heirefs In the county, not much more than twenty years of age.
He died in 
1768.
BlOGRAPHlA CuMB.
The Rev. Joseph Wise, an author ftlll living, is the fon of a refpeftable yeoman In this parlfh, at a 
place called The Bogg.
After a common fchool education, and being dillinguifhed for his genius, about 
1752, he was articled, firft, to Mr. Chriftlan, and after the death of Mr. Chriftian, to a Mr. Atherton, 
an eminent attorney at Carlifle.
The dull drudgery of fuch an employment ill fuited his adlive and 
afpiring mind.
Accordingly, after finlfliing the term of his indenture, he quitted that employment; and 
repaired to London, as many other fanguine young men have done ; in full confidence, that there his 
talents would be patronized, and his genius rewerded.
The patronage and reward he found were fuch, 
as nine out of ten of fimilar adventurers from the north experience : he became an ufher in an academy ; 
and, to eke out his fcanty earnings there, became alfo a writer for the bookfellers.
He wrote feveral 
fmall pieces for The Wefimirfler fournal; and various poetical effufions for The Lenves, or Sujfex, Jourttal.
He alfo wrote a preface, and many notes, for a Bible that was to have been printed In numbers; but 
which, owing to the Infolvency of the printers, was dropped.
He alfo wrote an Ode on the marriage 
and coronation of the prefent king and queen ; and, foon after, a dramatic piece, called The Coronation 
of King David.
About t 759, he went into orders ; and marrying foon after a relation of the late Bifliop 
Law of Cailifle, he ibtained, through his means, the fmall living of Penhnrf, in Suffex.
This Is all the 
preferment he has ever had.
A large'family of nine children was one of the confequences of his marriage i 
for whofc benefit.
In 1775, publifhed by fubfcription a volume of poems.
His fubfeription is not 
mimercus : and the names appear to be, chiefly, his quondam neighbours and friends in Cumberland.
He had befoie, viz.
in 1769, publifhed Providence, a poem ; which many think the bell; thing he ever 
wrote.
Since that, he has written An Expoftion of the Apocalypfe; An Efay on Sacrifice, Stridlures on 
the Prophecies, and An EJfay on Moral Nature and Duty.
His verfes are fometimes corredf, and always 
fenfible : but they are never terfe : they want eafe and grace.
He alfo publifhed a tragedy called 
Nadir; and one or more other effays, in profe, on fome theological topics: none of which, there is 
feafon to think, were much noticed.
In 1781, he publifhed by fubfcription alfo three books out of five 
ef

there, with proper endowment, and all parochial rights ; the advowfon to apper-, 
tain to the monaftery, with a refervation of epifcopal jurifdidion.
This tcftifies 
to us the confequence the place was of at that time : yet we do not find that the 
power fo granted was ever carried into execution; for the fame bifliop, by his 
epifcopal ordonance, dared the nth day of April, 1303, granted to the abbot and 
convent power to build a church at Arlolh, with all parochial rights, and authbrity 
to nominate a prieft for inftitution, with a falary of four pounds a year.
The reafons 
therein afiigned for making fuch grant, are — “ That the lands and poflefiions of 
the abbot and convent at Holm Cultram were not within the limirs of, but were 
far diftant from, any parifli;” and fiating their impoveriflied condition by the 
hofiile invafions and depredations of the Scotch.
If the church of Skinburnefs 
had been built according to the ordonance of 1301, the ftatings of the fecond grant 
would have been falfe, and the importance of the fecond church muen decrcafed.
The great delolation this country fuffered, by the incurfion of Robert Brus, was 
after the deflrudlion of Skinburnefs; for that event happened in the 16th year of 
King Edward II.
when this whole territory w'as deftroyed by fire and fword, and 
the monaflery was pillaged and burnt.
The devaftation made by the breaking in of the fea mufl; have been tremendous; 
for, in the place of the borough, the magazines of princes, and a country full of 
merchandize and people, there remains nothing but a fandy wafie.
The dirtance from Carlifle to the nearefl: boundary of this parilh, is twelve miles ; 
from Abbey town to Wigton, fix miles.
— It contains twenty-feven gricvefliips, or 
hamlets, and about 1500 inhabitants; the contents of fiatute acres, about 8000 acres 
of inclofed ground, and 5500 acres of common, and about 3000 acres of mofs.
— 
The tillage land grows wheat, barley, oats, and beans ; very few potatoes, and no 
turnips : the wheat is fown upon a fummer fallow.
The parifh is comprehended 
in one entire lordfhip or manor, of which Rowland Stephenfon, Efq. is lord ; 
whofe relation, the late Edward Stephenfon, Efq. purchafed it of William Burton, 
of a lengthy ethic poem, entitled The Syjlem; with copious notes In profe.
That he fhould fail In an 
attempt to difeufs deep metaphyfical queftions In poetry, is but little to be wondered at t It Is but jufllce 
to obferve however, that this poem (liews him to have read much, and to have thought ftill more.
The 
following lines, to which many of even fuperior merit might be added, are neither feeble nor unpoetical: 
“ How fit our ftate, — how fit the frailties giv’n, 
“ To humble pride, and hope exalt to heav'n !
“ Inllruftive objects hourly vve fiirvey 
“ In all around, that flour Ifii and decay : 
“ Each fading flow’r, each brute refigning breath, 
“ Infpires a grave foliloquy on deallt : 
“ Eacli op’ning bloom that beautifies the fpring, 
“ Each fproirtirig blade, and every new-fled- ’d wing 
“ That mounts i-ejoicsng on the chryftal wirrd, 
“ Bodes refurrediron to the mnfing triittd : 
“ Pride looks on thor'e, and tears fia.
t in her eye ; 
“ Hope looks on thefe, and fmrllng views the fley.” 
We do not know, that any more than three books of this poem have ever been committed to the prefs; 
though the title-page announces five.

Extent.] From E.
to W.
exclufive of lands, twelve miles ; breadth about three miles.
Commons.] Here is more common land than inclofed ground.
— Part of the common confifts of mof^ 
and barren land, covered with heath, but chiefly of fine level green raarflty land, affording the linefl 
pafturage for liorfes and cattle of any common in Cumberland.
Soil and Produce.] The foil is various : on the north and eaft fides a itiong deep clay in general; 
Jn fome parts inarfliy, in others loamy : the Low Holm is low and level, and conllitutes the greater part 
of the parifh.
The fouth, and particularly the fouth-weil, part, is chiefly of a light red fand, and naturally 
produces furze or whins.
When properly cultivated, it produces rye, barley, oats, potatoes, and clover ; 
and would grow good turnips, if cultivated for that purpofe ; and barley and clover would fucceed 
cffeilually.
The Low Holm, and part of the High Holm, produces excellent crops of wheat and oats, 
vith a little barley ; it alfo futniflies a great deal of excellent pafture land.
Horses and Cattle.] Are of diiferent breeds, and in general heavier than thofe In mod parts of 
Cumberland.
Fuel.] Chiefly peats and turf, there being a great quantity of peat-mofs in the parifh.
The coal 
ufed is brought from Bolton and the neighbourhood.
Qjjarries and Mines.] A little freellone, but no limeftone, coal, or other mineral.
Springs.] This parifh, and particularly the Low Holm, Is badly watered, there being very few brooks 
or fptings.
The Waver, a fmall river, runs near to the church, and falls Into the Wampool on the fea 
coaii The Low Holm is fo level, that, were there no ditches or drains, called there nuater-dyket, the 
laud in wet feafons and winter would be much overflowed.
Rabbit Warren.] A coiifiderable one upon the coafl.
Fish.] Here are valuable fea-fiflieries, particularly about Skinburnefs, from which many people earn 
their fubfiftence.
Anthiuities.] Befidcs the remains of the abbey, the old church of Long-Newton Is remarkable.— 
Tradition fays this was the parifh church.
— It is fituated almoft at the eaftem extremity of the pailfli : 
the roof and lleeple are gone.
The fize of this place within, exclufive of the fpace where the fteeple 
was, is nine yards by four yards : the fleeple, it is apprehended, was a place of refuge.
The walls are 
very thick, built chiefly of hard blue pebbles ; the iiifide has not been plaltered, fo that the walls have a 
very rugged appearance.
Several families continue to bury their dead in the chutch-yard.
From the 
above circumftances, It feems, that the inhabited part of this extenlive parifli has in ancient times been 
very fmall ; that the wefleni pait has been common land, and that the Low Holm was originally gained 
from the lea : the appearance of the country jultifies this Idea 
Aspect and General Appearance.] The fouth-weil part of this parifh Is rather high, and the 
fuiT ce uneven.
The gieatefl part, of the parifli is a peifeft plain : the fields are regular, and pretty well 
divided with quiekfet fences.
'I'hete is little wood, except a few trees about the dwelling-houfes.
The 
fiiims in general are occupied by their owners, who are moflly people of good circumllances.
— The old 
dwelling-houfes arc poor clav huts ; but the modern oiks are genteel ilone buildings, or built of brick.
-.Ipoii the whole, this is a fertile, lich and pleafant p.arifh.

. (in ALLERDALE ward below DERWENT.) 
TN order to complete our account of the ward of Allerdale below Derwent, wc 
X muft turn our fteps foiithwardy before we pafs the boundary of Cumberland 
ward.
^ The parilh.of Gilcruix comprehends one manor only, which was part of the 
^poll^flions of the abB?y of Calder.
It was a dependent manor of the barony of 
Allerdale, and ^^ ranied by Waldeof, firft lord thereof, to Adam, fon of Ljulph, 
whofe daughterand heirefs married a Bonekill, who granted the fame to a younger 
brothjT; and his two fons, Thomas and Walter, gave it to that religious houfe.
— 
Xfter^c diffolution, it w'as granted by Philip and Mary to Alexander Armflrong 
and his heirs male, under the defeription of twenty-four melFuages and tenements, 
with a water corn mill, Sec. of the yearly value of 4I.
15s.
8d.
under the condition 
of providing five horfes, w'ell caparifoned, when ever fummoned, within the county 
of Cumberland.* In the 7th year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Alexander and 
Herbert lArmfirong, by fine, conveyed to William Armftrong, fon of Herl^rt and 
Catharine Dalfion, and to William’s heirs for ever, the manor of Gilcruix, with 
the lands, &c.
In the 17th year of that reign, it appears that the pofiefiions of the 
Armftrongs had reverted to the crown, for the manor, lands, &c.
were then granted 
out (under the'defeription, of late in the tenure of William Armftrong) to Soakey 
and^runfon, to hold as of the manor of Eaft Greenwich ; from w horn, by various 
fales, and otherwife, the eftate became the property of the family of Dykes.
f 
The church w’as re<ftorial ;§ but, on being given to the abbey of Calder, was'*, 
made appropriate, and thereupon vicarial rights were conftituted.
On the appro- 
priation, 
• In the margin of Qpke’s Firft Inftitutes, p.
59, 60, It Is noted, that a caufc was depending 38th 
Elizabeth, touching the cuftoms of this manor: the lord claimed an arbitraiy fine at the lord’s will upon 
every change of lord, though the change grew by his own aA, and that daily.
A cafe \ygs made, and 
opinion given by all the judges with Lord Chief Juftice Popham, That the cuftom to take fines upon 
ever)’ alienation of the lord was unreafonable and unlawful.” 
The vicar has about fix tenants, who pay 12s.
rent, and a two-penny fine on death or alienation.
— 
In 1368, Bilhop Strickland endowed the vicarage.
The manfion houfe, and lands in Gilcruix fields ; 
half of tithe hay ; w6ol, lamb, milk, mills, icings, and oblations and altarage, with a ftipend from the 
convent of four marks yearly.

This is a fmall parifli.
extending along I lien about two miles, and in breadth little ij;gre than one mile.
About one-fifth part of the land is common, lies low, has a verdant turf, and affords good pafturage for 
young cattle, but is too wet for flreep, and coufequently none are kept here.
They breed a great^tnany 
black cattle of a middle fize.
Soil and Produce.] A heavy, wet foil In general, rifing off clay not very fertile, but pf^ucci 
wheat, oats, barley, peas, and potatoes, but no turnips — Moll of it is good grafs land.
Rents.] From aps.
to 6s.: — The average about 15s.
Mines.] Plenty^f fine coal.
— Limeftone and freeilone quarries.
Poor.] The poor rate colledlcd by the purvey, about 30I.
yearly.
School.] One fchool, biit not endowed.
Tithes.] All tjthes are paui in kind, except for hay, for which there is a prelcriptlve payment.
TenureS'OF Ea'nds.] Botti cullomaryand freehold, of cufiomary tenure chiefly ; the manor belongs 
to ‘Mils DyJ^es, the principal proprietor.
Game.] Hares and paittidge.
Springs.] This parifh is perhaps the moll remarkable of any In England for the finenefs'and number 
of its fprings.
In the village of Gilcruix, which is built In a triangular form, a fine fpring rifes almoll 
at every door fufficieiit to turn a mill, which,.
'when uniti^^, form a confiderable ftream.
In a field, a 
little to the eaftwaVd of the village, are two fprings, dillarit from each other 40 or 50 yards ; the one of 
frefh water, the otlier fait, ^nd of medicinal qualities ; the falt-fpriiig goes by the name of To 7 niny-Tack.
. Aspect and General^ Appe.arancf.] This parifli is not much jj^^m the level, the inclination of the 
iJnds is towards the north.
The river Ellen bounds it on that fide.
Flere is little wood growing, which 
makes the country lock bare and open.
The houfes In geir'ial are very good, built iu a modern form, 
and covered with blue flates.
Tbf fences are of quick wood, and the country commands a fine view to- 
wards Scotland, and the fea.
— EUot-Hall Is a luinous old building, fitjapted near-the river Ellen, anciently 
he feat of the Dykes’s family.
Warthel-Hall, In more modern tiindS, was the place of their refi.’cnce, 
^ but is noy^let to a farmer, and appears In a negledled flate.
The front of the h, ufe is orn.imeyitfd with 
a proftifion of curious old-fafliioned carving a]mut the doors and' windows.
Tiw garilens, tlic lifWn, &c.
aiy totally neglefte^ the trees are fuffered to 'bF cut down, and the whole coiuitenancc of thq place

place, per' aps a dgo, being a great card-player,- and one time being on the wrong fide, of fortune 
to a gieat amount, ^^order to retrieve his Ioffes at once, he determined to make a defperatc Itroke, and 
pledged.

The llory goes) that the 
game running nearly even, at the concluding deal, he-cxclaimed, — 
“ Up nov: duce^ or elfe a tray., 
“ Or H^arnel's gone for ever and aye.” 
The cards came up to his wiflies, and he faved his eftate ; to perpetuate the remembrance of that 
event, he had fculptured on one end of his houfe- the figure of a caid duce, and a tray on lhe:Other, 
•which remained for many years, till the houfe was rebuilt.
Char.\Ser.] Mr. Joseph Jackson v as born, and lived the greateft part of his time, at Gilcruix, 
His great roilities as a.mineralogift and philofopher werC 'generally known.
In the year 1784, he made 
propofitions towards th'e dtfeovery of the longitude, which were publiftied in the Cumberland Pacquet for 
the month of May, in tliaTyear.
His philofophical opinions were coiifidered as being ver^fingular, 
though fpecious, and fupported by powerful reafonings : he attempted to difprovethe Newtonian fyftem, 
in moft of its principles, though he allowed the fun to be 7a fixed central body, and the ea th a moving 
bod^;4but then he infilled that the earth moved in a ri^t line backwards and forwards, by'which the 
various feafons.
See. were produced.
He piefirmed, that a oi comprejfton fupplied the place of 
\attraW^n, — an effeA which he infilled neither did nor could poffibly exift.
( In this notion I perfedly 
"'soincide ‘ivitb him.
) — He died in 1789, at Lourdeank, in France, on his return from Spain ; to whiedi 
country he travelled about eighteen months before his death, under thejpatipnage of the Spanilli ambaHa- 
dor, to open a colliery' in the province of Andalufia.
By his letters 'to his friends, they learned, that, 
although he had done as much as human art and knowledge could do, to aiifwer- the end of his journey', 
neither the Scotch nobleman who recommended him, nor the ambalfador, treated him with generofity or 
honour; bat, on- the contrary, he w'as fo far negledled, that he was not even xeimburfed^e.-expences of 
his travelling; the thoughts of which, it is fuppofed, haftened on his dilTolution.
A ftril^^lelfon to his 
countrymen, not to truft to the dclufive lliadoWs.hcld out by' infidiouB Hates and treacherous ftrangeffi.
The fteadlntfs he Ihewcd in perfevering in his opinions, vyas only c.^ualled by his good- nature and 
affabilitv, accompanied by' an earneft wilh to promote ufefid fcience and knov^ ledge.
This ingenious man departed this life at the early age of fifty years.
Housman’s Notes.
^ 
* It is bounded by Gilcruix beck on the weft, by the river Ellen on the north, by 'JAhreap'and gill on 
the cart, snd from the head of Threapbnd gift, along the horfe.cour/e to the top of Moothay, on the 
fouth.
, 
It is a cuilofnary manor.
The tenants pay arbitrary fines, hetiots, boons, and fervices.
The ancient" 
demefne is called the mefnes, and lie towards Ellen.
“ When Ifhall was demefne of Allerdale, it contained Rygythwalte, Blencrahe, Warthole, Ilcdmain, 
half of Plumbland and Sunderland, with their appurtenances.
Alap, the Ton of Waldeof, gave Ruthwaite 
and the third part of the waftes of Iftiall to Gamcl Ic Brim, Lord of Bothil, ad tertiam partem unius villie.
And he gave the principal manor of Khali cum pertinentiis Blencrake, and the fervices of Newton to 
Radulph'Engayne.
Radulph had iffue William Eng^^me, and a daughter named .'\da, mother to Sir 
Hugh Morvill.
Of her it is written (by a monk) that, in the old age of her huftand, Hie was greatly 
enamoured of one Lyolf, a young gentleman that ferved her hulband, whom by no means Hie could per- 
fuadc to abufc hirufelf towards his mailer, he dutifully avoiding every uccafion that might further her

Wardale, als.
Warthole, is another manor which belonged to the abbey of 
Calder, and is now the property of the family of Dykes, who came from Dykesfield, 
in Burgh barony.
Here the watch and ward were ufually kept, and from hence 
fignals were given to Moothay beacon, on any inroad of the Scotch.
Parsonby is a fmall manor held of the recd:or.:]: — Arkleby,!
or Akcleby, lately 
belonged to the Thompfons, who purchafed it.
Like mod of the property in this 
county, it gave a local name to its pofTelTors, and the Arclebys held it for many 
generations, till the family fell into females, and, by the marriage of the heirefs, 
the efiate became vefted in one of the Martindales, of Newton, and was afterwards 
forfeited by Roger de Martindale, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, for his 
adherence to the partizance of the Queen of Scots.
Queen Elizabeth granted it to 
Sir John Penruddock, w'hofe grandfon.
Sir John Penruddock, was beheaded at 
Salifbury, in 1652, along with Colonel Groves, who fuftered under the hands of an 
infamous banditti.
Guftavus Thompfon, Elq. about the year 1740, pulled down 
the old hall, and built a very good houfe upon the lire of the old houfe.
The 
demefne and manor are now the property of James Clarke Satterthwaite, Efq. of 
Papcalile.
— In the wall of the houfe are roughly cut, on three flones, the figures 
reprefented in the plate of Afpatria antiquities.
— See page 288.
The church of Plumbland* is rediorial, dedicated to St. Cuthbert, having a glebe 
of 
Lucy, Lord of Egremont, and Sir Richard Waryne, or Werune, who enjoyed the fame, together with 
the barony of Burgh ; and after them, It fell to Thomas, the fon of Thomas de Multon, (as will here- 
after appear In the title of Burgh.) Thomas de Multon, in the time of King Henry III.
entailed Ifhall 
and Blencrake, with the appurtenances, to his two younger fons, Edward and Hubbert, and their heirs 
general fucceffively.
And fo loft the Lords of Ifhall the fervices of Newton, becaufe that tenure remain- 
ed in the grantor, Thomas Multon, and his heirs, as it had to him defeended.
“ By that entail, Hubbert Multon enjoyed Ifhall, and William his fon after him ; whofe daughter 
Margaret brought the inheiitance Into the family of the Lighes in King Edwai'd II.
's time, whofe iffue 
male enjoyed it, till old Thomas LIghe, the laft of that name, gave It to his, wife, Maud Redmain, whom 
he married, (being a widow, after the death of his firft wife) a lufty young gentlewoman, who granted It 
prefently after his death to Wildfrid Lawfon, her prefent hufband.” Denton’s MS.
Maud Redmain, the widow of old Thomas Leigh of Ifhall, being poirefTcd of the Inheritance, as 
appears by the context, foon after married Wilfrid Lawfon, and as frankly conveyed over the Inheritance 
to him, as fhe had received it of Leigh ^ which Wilfrid (afterwards Sir Wilfrid) having no iffue by the 
fald Maud his wife fettled his eftate upon William Lawfon, a kinfman of his own, to the great difguft 
of Mary Irton, (heir general of Maud Redmain) who had long time before continued In hopes that he 
would have fettled it upon her ; but being difappointed In that, fhe attempted to recover It by law againft 
William, pretending that Maud Redmain had not made a legal conveyance to Sir Wilfrid, and that what 
fhe did was the effeft of honible threatnings and violence.
But the fuit was at laft ended byoompofition, 
William Lawfon giving her for her title the tithes of Blencrake, and the demefne of Threlkeld, worth 
together about 200I.
per annum.” Gilpin.

THE PARISH OF TORPENHOW* 
(in allerdale ward below Derwent) 
C OMPREHENDS the fcveral diftridls of Torpenhow, Blennerhafiet, White- 
rigs, Kirkland, Bothil, Bowaldeth, and Threapland.
Torpenhow was, at the conquelt of England, antient demefne of the barony of 
Allerdale, until Allan, the fon of Waldeof, gave the fame in frank marriage with 
“ Gunyld his fifter, to Ughtred, the fon of Fergus, Lord of Galloway, to be holden 
” by him and his heirs by cornage and other fervices.
— In King Henry Il.’s time, 
** one Philip de Valomes, in right of his wife, held the fame of Reginald Lucy and 
Annabel his wife, who had the moiety of Allerdale, till the king feized the 
‘‘tenure.
And in King John’s rime, Robert Stutevill, brother to the Lord 
" Nicholas Stutevill (Lord of Lyddall barony) held it.
— In 31ft King Henry III.
“ William, the fon of William de Ulfsby,.
gave three carucates of land there to 
“ Robert Mulcaflre, and held five parts of Torpenhow, (Brun held the other fixth 
“ part, which he adjoined to his manor of Bothil) of the faid Lord of Lyddall, 
“ heir to Stuteville.
The faid five parts defeended to the Mulcaflres, and from 
“ them to the Tilliofs, whofe coheirs transferred the fame, wdth other lands, to the 
“ families of the Morefbys and Colvills.
“ It is called Tor-pen-how, j- every fyllable of which word, in the feveral 
languages of the people which fucceflively did inhabit the place, doth fignify 
“ after a fort the fame thing.
The Britons, who were the firfi inhabitants, call a 
“ rifing topped hill (fuch an one as is there) Pen^ i.
e. a head.
The Saxons next 
•' fucceeding to them, and not well underftanding the fignification of Pen, called 
“ it ^or-pen, i.
e. pinacle pen.
And they who came next, perhaps underftand- 
“ ing neither of the former names, called it (as we do yet) Por-pen-how, i.
e. the 
” how or hill Torpen.
Others have thought it fo named upon this occafion : the 
“ Saxons called a village Dorp, or rather Thorp ; and finding a hill there to be 
“ called of the Britons (their forebears) Pen, a head or hill top, they named it 
“ Dorpen-bow, the town-hill.
Others will have it named of one Turpe, whom

Housman’s Notes.
J The priorefs and nuns having the right of advowfon, Bifliop Irton, A.
D. 1290, endowed the 
s/Icarage, ordaining, that the vicar fhould keep In his houfe three priefts and one fubdean.
'We cannot think ourfelves quite at liberty to -clofe our account of this parifli, without firft noticing a 
traditionary report, (which many well-informed perfons of the family believed and affirmed to be well- 
founded) that the family of the Addisons, a name Immortalized by the celebrated fecretary, originally 
came from Lovj-WeoJ Nook, In this parlfh.
How, when, or on \vhat occafion, the progenitors of Dean 
Addifon went to Mau/d’s Meburn, in Weftmorland, it is not in our power to ftate : but we remember 
to have feen fundry letters that pafled between Jofeph Addifon, Efq. afterwards fecretary, and the Rev.
Anthony Addifon, of Queen’s college, and Redlor of Abingdon, who conftantly fubfcribed himfelf his 
coujiri; and who, undoubtedly, was of that branch of the family that fettled at Whitehaven.
Thefe 
letters, in which there are frequent allufions to this circumftance of their being all of one family, were, 
many of them, preferved by fome of the family In Maryland : where, many years ago, we faw them in 
the pofleffioB of that excellent man and excellent fcholar, the Rev. Henry Addifon.
The fadl moreover 
Is fomewhat confirmed by the intimacy and conneftion which always fubfifted between both the Weft- 
morland and Cumberland Addifons and Sir Jofeph Willlamfon ; to whom the dean, in an uncommonly 
neat and handfome ftrain of panegyric, dedicates both his Account of Weft Barbary and The Prefent State 
of the Jews.
It was either on the removal of one of them Into Weftmorland, or foon after, thac the fmall eftate at 
Low-Wood Nook was dlfpofed of, when twm brothers went off to fettle, one in Maryland, and the other 
in Whitehaven ; together with a filler, w'ho married a Mr. Bowles, and fettled, on the fame plan, in 
London.
Their purpofe was to prefecute a grand fcheme of trade, on the coaft of Africa, and In 
Maryland and Virginia : and this they carried on with great credit and fuccefs for many years.
The 
Whitehaven branch is now all extinfl : what remained of theii property having ultimately centred in 
the prefent Mrs. Wallace, of Carleton-Hall, who, by the mother’s fide, is defceiided from the Addifons ; 
by whole hulband, the late attorney general, it was all fold.

and cultivatable, though it is, in its natural Hate, rather wet and barren ; not many flveep are kept upon 
it, as they are there fubjeft to the rot.
Soil and Produce.] The foil differs greatly ; fome parts loam, or gravel, or black wet earth.
The 
weftern part of the parifh is moft fertile ; the land there produces plentiful crops of wheat, barley, and

PARISH OF IREBY.
3*^4 
The patronage for many years remained in the lords of the manor; and it was 
not till the year 1567 that we find, by any adl of prefentation, a feverance had 
taken place.
— Lord Lonfdale is the prefent patron.
THE PARISH OF IREBY,t 
(in ALLERDALE W'ARD below DERWENT.) 
TREBY, Camden fays, was called Arbeia in the time of the Romans.
Their 
“ A band of foldiers, called Barcari Tigrienfis^ were then placed there.
At the con- 
quefl: it was a gentleman’s feat and a village, and then called Ireby; and now it 
“ is become two manors.
High Ireby, in old evidences called Alta Ireby, becaufe 
it ftands higher on the hill ; and Low Ireby, in ancient writings named 
Ireby Bafe, and Market Ireby alfo, of a libeny to hold a fair and market there 
Extent.
] From the north-weft to the fouth-eaft about five miles, in width about two miles and a half.
Common Lands.] Were divided about thirteen years ago ; a great part not capable of cultivation, 
from its high and rocky fituation.
Soil and Produce.] The foil, towards the fouth-eaft fide of this parifh, is a deep red, light, loamy 
foil, part of the divided common ; on the other fide it is loamy, rifing off a ftrong clay : about Bolton- 
Gate the foil is inclined to gravel.
The farmers here depend diiefly upon their corn crops ; a great quantity 
of wheat is raifed, as well as barley and oats.
— They fallow for wheat, and fometimes lay forty bufhels 
of lime on an acre.
— The general return of grain, of wheat is eight for one fown, barley feven, oats five.
—Few turnips are grown, and not many potatoes.
— The hay crops are neither heavy nor fine, and con- 
fequently the cattle are fniall, when fat weighing about eight ftone a quarter.
— Horfes are like to thofc 
in the neighourhood.
Fuel.] Coals, bought at the pit, five Cailifle pecks for 6d.
Game.J Some groufe, with partridge, hares, &c.
Mines.] Abundance of coal and lime j — alfo a fort of coal called kennel, which bums fi-eely, and gives 
a confiderable light.
Roads.] The principal roads from Carlifle to Whitehaven.
— There are no quarries wrought.
Rivers.] The Ellen, a fmall river, runs through this parifli, ovei which are feveral little bridges.— 
Trout and eels in the ftreams.
Poor.] The money for the maintenance of the poor is collefted by the purvey — The parlfh is divided 
into two parts, called the Highfide and Lowfide of Bolton.
Tithes.] l.owfide pays a prefciiptive fum of money in lieu of tithes; Flighfide pays tithe corn.
Ten ure of Lands.] Chiefly freehold under the Earl of Egremont.
Rents.] Average value of lands in this parifh is about i6s.
per acre.
Antiquities.] Near Weary-Hall, is a field, containing about an acre and a half of land, which 
appears to have been moated about, and raifed above the level of the neighbouring field, but no remain* 
of building upon it.
Aspect and General Appearance.] The fouth-eaft part is very high ground, and falls in every 
diieftion ; the reft of the land of this parifli is not very' imlevel, but it generally inclines towards the north.
—Here is little wood ; but the buildings and hedges are good, which renders the appearance of the 
country pleafant.
Housman’s Notes.
t It is bounded on the north-eaft fide of the river Elne from the foot of Newbiggin demefiie up to 
the head of the ftanding lake called Orr-Water, and thence to the top of Binfel-fell on the fouth, and fo 
to the head of the fpring which falls down by Snittlegarth called Weft Skawbeck to the foot thereof, 
where it falls into Elne on the north- weft.

Extent.] From north to fouth four miles, and in width about two miles and a quarter.
Soil and Produce.] The foil is a red, light loam, which, from the fituation, is better adapted to the 
produftion of grafs than corn ; oats and barley are the principal kinds of grain railed here.
No' turnips, 
but good potatoes.
Wheat crops often fail, from being too grofs : — this defect; might, I doubt not, be 
remedied either by early fowing, cropping in the fpring, or fome particular management of the ground.
They generally manure for barley, which Is fucceeded by two and fometimes three crops of oats, and fo 
laid down, generally without fowing grafs or clover feeds.
Commons and Sheep.] About three-fifths of the parKh Is common land ; the furface of which Is

In the parifh of Ireby there is not the leaft trace of a Roman camp, that wc 
could gain any information of ; neither hath any difcovery ever been made of any 
Roman impliments, infcriptions, or other remains.
Low Ireby is a mile diftant from the former place.
It has a weekly market on 
Thurfday, and two yearly fairs, on the feafl: of St. Matthias and St. Matthew.
— 
The Thurfbys held it as an aflart of the foreft of Weftward.
The church was rectorial,!
and was given to the prior and convent of Carliflc 
by Alan, fecond Lord of Allerdale ; and the monaftery received confirmation of 
the grant from King Henry 11 .

1626.
In this neighbourhood was born the Rev. John Wallis, A.
M. late of Billingham, in the county of 
Durham, but we are uncertain of the place of his nativity.
— He was of Queen’s college, Oxford ; where 
he acquired fome reputation as a found fcholar.
Though pofTefled of good natural abilities, and no fmall 
fhare of acquired knowledge, he lived and died in an humble ftation.
His difpofition was fo mild, and 
his fenfe of duty fo proper, that he paffed through life without a murmur, or a figh, in his humble fortune.
Early in life he married a lady near Portfmouth, where he, at that time, refided on a curacy.
For fifty- 
fix years they enjoyed the happinefs of their matrimonial connexion : an happinefs that became almoft 
proverbial in their neighbourhood.
Mr. Wallis, after fpending a few years in the fouth of England, 
became curate of Simonburn, In Northumberland.
In that fituatlon he indulged his tafte for the lludy 
of botany, and filled his little garden with curious plants, from that country abounding with them.
This 
fituation, and thofe amufements, led him into deeper refearches in natural hiftory; and, in the year 1769, he 
publilhed a “ Hifory x)f Northtanberlandf in two volumes 410 ; the firft of which, containing an account 
of minerals, foflils, 5cc.
found in that county, is reckoned the moll valuable.
His fortune did not improve 
w ith his reputation, and a difpute with his redlor occafioned him to leave his fituation, when he and his 
wife were received into the family of a clergyman, who had formerly been his friend at college.
He was 
curate for a fhort time at Fiaughton, near Darlington, 1 775 ; and foon afterwards he removed to Billing, 
ham, near Mtockton, where he continued, till increafing infirmities obliged him to refign.
He then 
removed to the village of Norton, where, in a fhort time, with all the confcioufnefs of a well-fpent life, 
he expired without a groan.
About two years before his death a fmall ellate fell to him by the death of 
a brother ; and, to the honour of the prefent Bllhop of Durham, when the circumllances and fituation of 
Mr. Wallis were reprefented to him, he allowed him an annual penfion from the time of his refigning his 
curacy.
From a fenfe of gratitude, Mr. Wallis, juft at the clofe of life, was employed In packing up an 
ancient ftatue of Apollo, found at Carver an, a Roman ftation on the wall, on the confines of Northumber- 
land, as a piefent to the Honourable Daines Barrington, brother to the billiop.
In the earlier part of his 
life, Mr. Wallis publifhed a volume of letters to a pupil, on entering into holy orders.

It is fubdivided into feveral cantonments, and the road from Kef-

It is diftant about ten miles from Kefwick, and as much

On the northern ext re-

This camp is in full view of Blatum Bulgii, Bownefs, and Olenacuniy Old

THE PARISH OF ULDALE 
(in ALLERDALE ward below DERWENT) 
I S ficuated on the eaftern banks of the river Ellen.
f — “ The manor of UIndalc 
“ lyeth above Bolton, and is fo called of the river Elne running through the 
“ fame, which river is diverfly named, as Elne, Alne, or Olne, (the Romans named 
it Olena) and trom thence the valley thereof is called Ulndale.
This manor, 
“ (being parcel of the barony of Allerdale) together with the manor of Gilcroufe, 
“ was given by Waldeof, the fon of Earl Gofpairick, unto Adam, the fon of Lyolf, 
brother of Phorne, the Ion of Lyolf, Baron of GreyFock ; from which Adam, 
they defcended by a daughter to the Bonckills, who granted forth Gilcroufe to a 
“ younger brother, Robert Bonekill; and the fons of the faid Robert, Thomas 
Bonekill and Walter, gave away their inheritance in Gilcroufe to the abbey of 
Caldre, which Ranulph Bonekill, Knight, then Lord Paramount both of Ulndale 
and Gilcroufe, confirmed to the abbot.
Sir Ranulph had ilfue Alexander, who 
** had ilfue Adam, who gave Awerthwaitc, parcel of his manor of Ulndale, to the 
priors of Carlifle.
The faid Adam had ilfue another Alexander Bonekill, whole 
daughter and heir firft married to John Stewart, kinfman to the King of Scots, 
and afterwards to David Bregham, a Scotch knight of great valour, and by him 
** transferred the inheritance to the family of the Breghams.
— This David Breg- 
“ ham was a companion of William Wallace, that was executed for treafon, at 
“ London, committed againft King Edward I.
by relifiing that king’s attempt for 
•' the fuperior lordfhip of Scotland, and by taking part with Robert Bruce againft

** Scots thus rhymed on them : 
The man was ne’er fo wight nor geud, 
“ But worthy Wallace durft him bydej 
Nor never horfe fo wild nor weud, 
“ But David Bregham durft him ryde.” 
" David Bregham thereby forfeited his eftate to Anthony Lord Lucy, then Lord 
of Allerdale; and fo Ulndale again became parcel of that antient barony, and the 
“ manor extinguilhed of right.
Yet it w'as continued as a manor by the Lucys

This manor, together with the advowfon of the redlory and redorial church,, 
have continued in the defendants of the Acron-Bank family to this time.
We cannot prefume to alter, in any manner, the account given us by our valuable 
correfpondent of this pariih : — and we acknowledge our obligations to the Rev.
Joseph Cape, the redor, for his valuable communications.
The Editors.
The didance of this parifh from Carlifle is eighteen miles, eleven from Kefwick, 
ten from Cockermouth, nine from Wigton, and one from the ancient town of 
Ireby.
It is about five miles in length, and tvvo miles in breadth, exclufive of 
feveral mountains in the parifh, where its boundary is not certainly known.
It is 
bounded on the eafl: by the parifii of Caldbeck, on the fouth by BafTenthwaite, on 
the weft by Ireby, and on the north by Bolton.
There are three hamlets, or 
divifions, in the parifh, viz.
Uldale, Auhertree, and Above-Ouze.
— Uldale has 
twenty-four houfes, which contain one hundred and ten inhabitants; Auhertree 
has twelve houfes, which contain fixty-four inhabitants ; and Above-Ouze has 
fixteen houfes, which contain an hundred and eleven inhabitants.
In this divifioii 
there are two fmall villages, Longlands and Qrthwaite, which contain only three 
houfes each; the reft are fingle houfes, and have each one a refpedive name; in all, 
fifty-two houfes, which contain tw'o hundred and eighty-five inhabitants : — all of the 
church of England, except one family, who are Quakers.
— There is only one ale- 
houfe in the parifli of Uldale.
There are two clergymen of the church of England, 
one fchoolmafter, feventeen farmers, fix day-labourers, tw'o fhoe-makers, two 
mafons, one taylor, one blackfmith, one weaver, one miller, one wool-comber, one 
lime-burner, one carpenter, one grocer, and one mantua-maker ; the reft of the 
inhabitants occupy their own eftates, which are in general fmall, few exceeding 
40I.
a year.
— There are twenty freeholders in the parifh of Uldale; three cuftomary 
tenants under Thomas Gaff, Efq. the prefent lord, and two under Lawfon Dykes 
Ballentine, Efq. Lord of Ireby ; all which are arbitrary, and pay a fine of two- 
years value at the deceafe of the lord, and likewife a fine at the alienation, and fine 
and heriot at the death, of the tenant ; which heriot confifts of the beft horfe or 
cow the tenant died pofielfed of ; boon-days of mowing and ftiearing arc alfo paid 
for thefe eftates.
— The land in general is fruitful, being moftly of a gravelly foil, 
and yields excellent crops of hay, tolerable crops of barley, oats, peas, beans, and 
potatoes : very little wheat is fown, and few turnips; but where the ground is 
properly prepared, the turnips take very well.
— There are feme grounds belong- 
ing to Uldale-Hall, the property of Thomas Gaff, Efq. which can fcarcely be 
equalled in Cumberland for grazing: in the higher parts of the parifh, which is 
known by the name of Above-Ouze, the land is not fo fruitful, being more 
mountainous, and much colder; the crops of corn there are generally light, and 
confift chiefly of oats and fome little barley.
— Land lets from ten to twenty

himj this paired alfo by that grant.

— There are feveral mountains in the parifh, but none particular 
for their height, or what they produce, though it is believed by many, that they 
contain metals of different kinds : fome fmall veins of copper were wrought a few 
years ago, by the then lord of the manor, John Gaff, Efq. but without fuccefs.
— 
ITeie mountains afford excellent pafturage for the fheep, the number of which 
is between four and five thouland ; thefe are moftly of the common Cumberland 
breed, which the farmers endeavour to improve by exchanging their rams every 
tw'o or three years, wEich they purchafe out of the beft ftocks, and ufually pay 
from one to two guineas, and fometimes confiderably more, for them, according 
to the quality of the wool, and the goodnefs of the ftteep.
— Wool fold the two laft 
years for about 7s.
6d.
per ftone, fixteen pounds to the ftone, which was rather 
lower than it has been for many years part ; the fleeces, in general, average fix to 
the ftone.
— Many of the farmers fpin their own wool, and carry it to Kefwick and 
Cockermouth markets to fell ; fome part of which is manufadfured in both thefe 
towns ; but the greateft quantity is fent to Kendal, to be manufadured there.
— At 
thofe markets, yarn has fold thefe late years from i is.
to 15s.

per ftone j but at 
prefent fcarcely any exceeds 1 2S.
and even fome of it will hardly fell at any price, 
owing to the efteds of the war.

crock ewes, which is a term amongft the fhepherds for thefe that are grown old, 
or otherwife in bad condition, from 4s.
to 6s.
a piece.
— A fheep-fair was eftablifh- 
cd at Uldale in the year 1791, which is annually kept on the 29th day of Auguft; 
at which fair nearly one thoufand flieep have been expofed to fale every year, and 
the greater part of them has always been fold.
The church of Uldale is redorial,* and of about the yearly value of Sol. It 
was rebuilt in the year 17;^, at the foie expence of the inhabitants.
It is but fmall, 
being twenty-tw'o yards in length, and but eight in breadth.

About fifteen 
years ago, VV'illiam Brow n, Efq. of Tallentire-Hall, who was a native of Orthwaite, 
and had his education at Uldale fchool, was at the expcnce of flagging the floor* 
which before was only clay, and often wanted repairs.
There are two fmall lakes in the parifli, which are pretty well flocked with fifh 
of different kinds, but chiefly pike and perch ; the larger is about a mile and a 
half in circumference, called the Overtvater^ on w'hich Thomas Gaff, Efq. has two 
boats, one for pleafure, the other for the purpofe of fifning: this, at the diflance 
of a few yards, joins with the river Ellen ; — the lefs, called Little Larity w'hich 
empties itfelf into the other, is about half a mile in circumference, and in fome 
places of a great depth.
— The river Ellen has its fource, or fpring, in this parifh.
It receives feveral additions of fmall rivulets and fprings, w hich abound here, be- 
fore it leaves the parifli; and, after running through the feveral pariflies of Ireby* 
Bolton, Torpenhow, All-Hallows, Afpatria, Plumblaud, Gilcruix, Dearham, 
Flimby, and Crofs-Canonby, empties itfelf into the fea at Maryport, after a courfd 
of betwixt twenty and thirty miles: — that town, till within thefe late years, was 
called Ellenfoot, but now Maryport, after the lady of the late Elumphrey Senhoufe* 
Efq. of Nctherhall.
There is a fine cafeade in the parifh, commonly known by the name of IVhile-m 
water-daJJj. After a great fall of rain it has a very grand appearance, and its foaming 
down the rocks may be feen at feveral miles diflance : the water which flows from 
it is part of the diviflon betwixt Uldale parifh and that of BafTenthwaite : it empties- 
itfelf into the lake of BafTenthwaite a little above Ouze-Bridge.
There are coals in this parifli ; but, on account of water, and the fmallnefs 
of the bandy at prefent they are not wrought.
The fuel chiefly made ufe of is coal, 
which is brought from the neighbouring parifh of Bolton, and is about four miles 
diflant : tliey are fold at fixpence a load, which contains about fix peeks, Carlifle 
mcafure.
Peat and turf are likewife made ufe of for fuel, but are not fo common 
as coal : the former is dug from the very fummit of the mountains, and is rather 
difficult to come at, on account of the diflauce and the badnefs of the road, which,, 
in general, is very fleep : turf is cafier to come at, being dug from the low'er com- 
mons ; but, on account of its being but an indifferent fort of fuel, is not much 
made ufe of, unlefs by the lower clafs of people.
— Lime is burnt in tiie parifli, and 
fold at fixpence the Carlifle or Cumberland bufliel.
The air is cold, efpecially near the mountains ; but it Is very healthy, and people 
live to a good old age.
In the year 1775, there was only one funeral, and that 
of a perfon brought from a neighbouring parifli; and, in the follow-ing years, 
there were only nine funerals, five males and four females ; and, in the year 1786,..
there were likewife only one.
— The parifli regifler began in the year 1643 > and,.
in comparing twenty years in the laft century with the lafl twenty years, I find- 
1 88 chriflenings, 130 burials, and 4.7 marriages ; for the laft twenty years, 170 
chriflenings, 76 burials, and 40 marriages, which fliews a dccreafe of population, 
VIZ.
1 8 chriflenings, 54 burials, and 7 marriages; and this may very eafily be

THE PARISH OF CALDBECK, 
(in ALLERDALE ward below DERWENT.) 
I T is certainly remarkable, that the fyllable in this name, which clearly denotes, 
and is defcriptive of, a brook, or river, fhould have been dropped in the name 
of that river, which runs through fo confiderable a portion of the parifh, and is one 
of its boundaries, and gives name both to the town in which the church ftands, 
and to the parifh ; whilft the other fyllable, which is of fomewhat dubious deri- 
vation, is retained: and both of them ftill obtain in the general name of the parifh.
It is to be accounted for, only by recollecfting, that Caldetv is one of thofe ancient 
Celtic compound words, which it is fo common to meet with every where in the 
names of places ; of at leaft a part of which word, beck, is a Saxon verfion ; 
Caldew,?iV\A Caldbeck, being nearly fynonymous, and both fignifying a ivoody Jireavi, 
or river.
There is fome difficulty alfo in afeertaining, whether the word is Caldbeck, 
or Caudebec : the difference betw een the two words, how ever, is not very material ; 
the Celtic vocable cal fignifies a wood, as well as the more common terms caud 
and cod, or the Welfh coed: and as au (whence the Saxon ea, and the French can) 
is the moft common of all the Celtic vocables which denote v/ater, Caiidau, or 
Caudew, is literally, zvater, or a river, Jkirted with wood.
And, as there is a ftream 
in Yorkftiire, near Northallerton, fpelled Caiidebeck, or Cod-beck, another in 
Normandy alfo fpelled Caudebec, analogy feems to require, that this place fhould 
be written in the fame manner.
Caudebec, fays Bullet in his Celtic Didfionary, 
from cod, a foreft, and bee, the embouchure of a river.
The learned Hicks, on the 
contrary.
PARISH OF CALDBECK.
S7i 
contrary, thinks both the fyllablcs originally northern; and that Caudebec is but 
the Gaulifli manner of pronouncing Kald-bec.* 
The fituation, boundary, and afped are next to be obferved.
— This is an ex- 
treme parifh in the ward of Allerdale below Derwent, lying under the fkirts of the 
mountains.
It runs from weft to ealt, from the Thorny-Stone to the head of 
MolTdale, in length about eleven miles, being hemmed in on the fouth by a ridge 
of mountains, called Cald-Felly Caldbeck-Fells, JSoon-Fell, and Carrock and, on the 
north, by a lower trad of fubordinate hills, that feem to ferveas (hores or buttrefles 
to the mountains, which run all along to Warncl-Fell, to an extent of about five 
miles.
On the eaft it abutts on the parifli of Cafile-Sowerby ; on the weft on Uln- 
Dale (quafi Elne-Dale, from the river Elne) on the north on Sebergham ,- and on 
the fouth on a huge trad of mountainous moors, that reach almoft to Kefwick.
Its more particular boundaries, as detailed from Denton, are the river of Caldew, 
w here a flill {mailer beck, called Caldhecky falls into it at the foot of Hefket de- 
mefne, to its head on the eaft fide of Coppake, as the water falls each way; from 
thence to the top of Cald-Fell, and fo by a rill, which falls down from Burbleth- 
waite, and the weft end of Greenrigg, to the head of Awhatree beck; then, turning 
northwards to Thorny-Stone, along a path-way, till it comes to Thiftle Bottom, 
and from thence up to the Rayes-Head, and fo dov/n to Shawk-Head ; and then 
turning down by the Brandreth-Stone, then by the height to the head of Brackley 
beck, and down the fame till it falls into Caldbeck above the bridge.
Some unavoidable confufion has arifen in fettling both the etymology and the 
boundaries of this parilh, from the circumftance of its having feveral names fo 
nearly fimilar both in found and fenfe; thus, the parilh and town are both called 
Caldbeck, and fo is a little beck that runs through the middle of it, and rifes in 
Cald-Fell.
This beck retains its name of Caldbeck, till after its confluence with 
another beck, rifing from the north fide of Skiddaw, called Caldew.
After this 
confluence, the united ftream becomes the Caudey, or Caldew ; which name it keeps, 
till it empties itfelf into the Eden below Carlifle.
Even careful deferibers do not 
always mention thefe dirtind: places and names with fufiicient accuracy and 
precifion.f

PARISH OF CALDBECK.
Of ancient notices rcfpecling Caldbeck, we have the follotving : — Long after 
the conqueft, this parifli was forefl: and wafle, and parcel of Allerdale.
And an 
highway, or main road, from Weftmorland and the eaftern parts of Cumberland, 
to the vveltern coalls of this county, having run through thefe forefis and waftes, 
they lay long under the imputation of being the refort of fuch free-booters, and 
dangerous outlaws, as we fuppofe Robin Hood and his fellow's to have been.
It was 
on this account, that Ranulph Engain, the chief forefler of Inglewood, granted a 
licence to the prior of Carlifle to build an hofpital there, for the exprefs purpofe of 
relieving fuch unfortunate travellers as were prevented from proceeding on their 
“ with fnow, and therefore called the Caldbeck, which, in the dialeft of the country, is Caldbeck, the 
“ brook being fed by at leaft an hundred cold fprings flowing into it from thofe mountains.
It containeth 
“ that dale now inhabited, and a great part of the mountains of Mofedale and Grifdale, until the White- 
“ waier-dafli, at the head of Alne or Elne, that falleth into Ulndale.
The two dales on the eaft fide of 
“ the mountains are hence named (viz.) Moffdale, of a great mofs ground there; and Grifedale, of a 
“ flore-houfe there, which the Barons of Grayftock held of Caldbeck, where they kept their ftieep, 
“ cattle, and fwine, and fuffered their porklins to run wild in the woods that grew in the flelrts and 
“ borders of the mountains.
“ After the grant of the hofpital ground, liberty was given to the prior, to inclofe part of the foreft, 
“ which he did, where the church flands at this time; which inclofure became part of the glebe of the 
“ church.
The prior procured not his confent for the right of the foil, but without his confent it could 
“ not be Inclofed, for that large deer lodged continually in the mountains and woods there, and it 
“ M'as then ufed as a park or forefl, and the right of the foil was in the Barons of Allerdale.
After this 
hofpital was built, they founded the church, and the place became fully inhabited in that part of the 
fame called Caldbeck Uppeton.
And afterwards it grew inhabited under the fell-fides, which later 
“ buildings they called Caldbeck Under-FclL Firft that part towards Grayflock, as Heflret and Halt- 
“ cleugh, was brought to tillage, as befl fitting for corn, which is the lower end of the dale ; and, there- 
fore, the hamlet at the church ftanding higher in the dale, was called Caldbeck up in the Town, and 
“ contraiflly Uppeton.
“ The priors became patrons of the refloiy, by the grant and confirmations of William de Vefey, 
“ and Burga his wife, and dame Alice Romley, Lady of Allerdale.
They then diflblved the hofpital, and 
“ endowed the church with the lands thereof about King John’s time.
In King Henry III.’s time, one 
“ John Franclgena, Francois, or French, a klnfman of Gilbert Francois, Lord of RouthclifF, was 
“ baron there, and got a great inclofure in Warnhlll-Bank, in the forefl of Englewood, which he joined 
“ to the glebe ; but the monks of Holme fo quarrelled him, that he was glad to part flakes, and gave 
“ them that moiety of the fame which is now called Trierhall, and kept that moiety to himfelf called 
“ the Parfon’s Park.

“ And now Philip Lord Wharton, his grand-child, enjoyeth the fame.
Afterwards, in the time of

“ Both the Caldbecks were one entire manor to Alice Romley.
By her death it was divided between 
“ her two fiflers children, (viz.) the houie of Abbeymarle and the houfe of Lucy, which divifion was 
ever after continued, it being managed by two feveral gravelhips, and by two colleftors, one in 
“ Caldbeck Under-Fell, and another in Caldbeck Uppeton, which are accounted now as two feveral 
« manors.” Denton’s MS.
It is now called HeJket-Nevj-Market, from a market lately fet up there, and in contradiftinAion to

hands of the defperate banditti aforefaid.
On this grant, the prior inclofed fomc 
portion of the foreft, in the environs of the hofpital, which flood near the place 
where the church now ftands: but, though it was thus inclofed, the right of the 
foil Bill remained in the Lord of Allerdale, whofe authority was neceflary to keep 
lawlefs multitudes, by whom thefe woods and hills were haunted, in fome degree 
of fubjedion and order.
Soon after the eredlion of this hofpital, a church was founded near it; and 
dedicated to the tutelar faint of the north, St. Mungo, or Kentigern ; of whom 
fome farther mention is made in the account of the parifh of Bromfield.
And, 
when a church was built, the place became inhabited, and the town of Caldbeck 
began to be formed.
There is reafon to believe, that this was the general origin 
of villages ; and that churches were prior, in point of foundation, to the villages 
which furround them.
In North Wales, Llan, equivalent to our /wz or /ozy;?, is 
the general name, not fo properly for a church, as is commonly fuppofed, as for a 
church-town ; fome places, fuch as Llany Givyddyl^ the Irifliman’s beach or fliore, 
now Holyhead, having been called Llan before a church was built : and the learned 
Dr. Davies admits, that L/zz« originally fignified rather the church-yard, the area, or 
ground, on which the church flood, than the church itfelf.
It was natural, that, 
in the early ages of Chriftianity when churches w^ere firfl founded, when men’s 
minds were animated by devotional ardour, they fliould wifli to be near and con- 
venient to their church ; the aged and infirm more efpecially.
In the prefent 
inrtance, befides this common motive for congregating in towms, they may feem to 
have been driven together alfo, for the fake of mutual defence and fecurity.
Caldbeck town, and vicinity, are now fpoken of as having foon become fully 
inhabited.
That part of it which lay near the church, being higher than the reff, 
was called Caldbeck-Upperton, Uppeton, or Upton; whilfl the part nearer the 
mountains naturally got the name of Caldbeck Under-Fell.
To thefe two ancient 
divifions of the town a third has fince been added, called the Enjl-End: flill, 
however, there are but two conftablewicks in all this extenfive parifh.
Gofpatric, fon of Orme, granted the patronage of the retlory to the priors of 
Carlifle.
And this grant was afterwards confirmed by William de Vefey, and 
Burga his wife, and dame Alice de Romley, Lady of Allerdale; and alfo by the 
Kings, Henry I.
and Edward IL* But, about the time of King John, the hof- 
pital w'as diffolved, and the church endowed with its lands.
Thefe lands, as be- 
longing to the church, have fince been called the manor of Kirkland.
In the fame king’s reign, one John Franceys was parfon of Caldbeck.
This 
(now not common) furname, which our venerable country antiquarian, Denton^ 
very propeily explains by hrancigena, was, no doubt, originally Francois, a French- 
man, juft as L'Anglois, a no lefs common name in France, w'as La Anglois, 
the Englifliman, now metamorphofed into Langley: and this individual, John 
Franceys, the parfon of Caldbeck, it is probable, came from Normandy along with 
the above-named William de Vefey, the De Vefeys b^ing one of the oldeft and

This John 
Franceys obtained a grant for a confiderable body of land on Warnel-Bank, within 
the foreft of Inglewood ; which lie incloied and annexed to the glebe ; and it is 
now called the ParJon'’% Park.
On fome ground or other, which is not known, he 
had a difpute with the monks of Abbey Holm, refpeding this grant; which he 
was glad to compound, by relinquifliing to them a (hare of it : and this grant from 
him to them was confirmed not only by the bifliop and his chapter, but alfo by 
King Henry HI.
in the i6th year of his reign.
This alienated fhare was between 
the bounds of the two fites of Grefgard-Gill on the weft, and Brotthole-Hill on 
the eaft.
The fhare left to the parfon of Caldbeck ftill remained fubjed:, however, 
to an annual crown rent of one mark, payable into the king’s exchequer at 
Michaelmas.
Parkhead feems to have been a part of the fame inclofure, though 
it is now held, in tenancy, under the redor, as part of the manor of Kirkland 
aforefaid.
About 1223, Prior Bartholomew granted the advowfon, which his predecefibrs 
had obtained from Gofpatric, to the Bilhop of Carlifle (viz.
Walter Malclcrk) and 
his fucceflbrs; and they have enjoyed itever fince.
In the 52d of King Henry 
III.
Cicely, Countefs of Albemarle, eldeft daughter of William Fitz-Duncan, is 
faid to have claimed, but on what pretence does not appear, the right of advowfon 
againft Bifhop Chaufe.
The name, at leaft, of this bifhop is dubious : Burn and 
Nicolfon acknowledge, that his name is varioufly written ; but, in moft of the lifts 
of bifhops that we have feen, Robert Cheveral, whom Leland calls the chaplain to 
the queen, appears to have been the bifhop at the period in queftion.
It is added, 
however, that, upon a quare impedit^ the bifhop, whoever he was, recovered the 
right of collation to the church of Caldbeck.
The Lords of Allerdale continued to enjoy the feigniory through the feveral 
defeents of the Lucys, till Maud, the female heir of that family, carried it to the 
Percys, Earls of Northumberland.
With the Percys it remained, till Henry, the 
lixth Earl of Northumberland, granted Caldbeck to King Henry VIII.

manors of Brundholme, Ulndale, and Kirkbride.
This Mr. Dallfon, the founder of 
the family of the Dalftons, of Acron-Bank, in Weftmorland, may be fuppofed to 
have been induced to purchafe in this neighbourhood, by his having married 
Mabel Dalfton, of Cardew.
The other part, viz.
Caldbeck Under-Fell, was fold 
at the fame time to Thomas Lord V/hai ion ; who was made a baron, on account 
of the vitlory he gained over the Scots at Sollom-Mofs.
Being alfo warden of the 
Weft-Marches, he could not but have great influence : and he became fo troublc*- 
fome a neighbour, that Mr. Dalfton was glad to fell Caldbeck-Upperton to

The whole continued in the Wharton family, till the famous Duke Philip,

He had, by his firft wife, a fon 
named Jofeph, who is ftill living, and inherits the property of his father — He married to his fecond wife, 
Ann Lancafter, daughter of a fmall fi-eehokkr in Paterdale, by whom he had a fon, named John, and a 
daughter, Efther.
John brought up to the church, was many years curate of Gilling, and fucceeded 
the late celebrated Mr. Sterne in the vicarage of Stillington, near York, which he enjoyed more than 
twenty years, and died in 1794- — The daughter, named Efther, married the Rev. Matthew Raine, 
mafter of the free grammar fchool of Hartforth, near Richmond, in Yorkfiiire, the place of his nativity, 
though the family of the Raines originated from Mickleton, in the parilh of Rombaldkirk, where they 
had property, and where, at this time, almoft a whole clan of that name refide.

Stanwick, and Reflor of Kirby Wiflr.

Efther the daughter, and Matthew and Jonathan the fons.
— Matthew Raine, the eldeft fon, was educated 
under his father, at Hartforth, till he was appointed, by the king’s nomination, through the intereft of the 
Earl of Holdernefs, a fcholar upon the foundation of the Chaiterhoufe.
He was elected off from that 
fchool, and admitted a penfioner of Trinity college, Cambridge.
Did himfelf very areat credit by the 
prizes he gained, both academical and collegiate.
He is now head mafter of the Charterhoufe fchool, 
B. D.
and Fellow of Trinity college.
— Jonathan Raine, the younger fon, was alfo educated under his

century afterwards, to the bifliop, almort: as foon as there was a bifhop.
If this 
date may be received as evidence, fome part of the prefent church of Caldbeck, 
w hich is Jarge and venerable, is nearly, if not quite, as old as any church, or part 
of a church, now rtanding in the county.
At a place called Brownrigg, in this parifh, there long dwelt a family of the 
name of (de Vallibus) who had a tradition, pretty clearly made out, that 
they came from Normandy to England with the conqueror.
They are now extintrt, 
at leaft in the male line, not only in the parifh, bur, as far as we know, in the 
county.
The following remarkable inferiptions in the church-yard are rtill legible; but, 
too probably, will foon be obliterated : 
“ Here lies the body of Robert Vaux, who was born at Brownrigg, and lived 
“and died there; being the 13th Robert fprung from that family.

below it.
Its eaflerii end, for about a mile and a half in length, and a mile in 
breadth, feems to be entirely covered with ftones.
Thefe are not of the very 
common kind : many of them are fmall, but they are of various lizes, and fome 
not lefs than 300 ton j and, when frcfli broken, appear to be, chiefly, porphyry 
and granite.* 
All round the fummit of this huge fell, which is of an oval form, there is a cir- 
cumference, or circle of ftones of a fimilar, that is to fay, elliptical or oval figure, 
•which feems to be inconteflably the work of men’s hands.
They are laid on each fide 
of the ridge, or fummit, of the mountain, at an equal diftance ; i.
c. about eight yards 
perpendicular, beneath the ridge, or top, on each fide ; but, at its two ends, they 
are not more than four yards below the ridge.
They do not appear ever to have 
been built into a wall ; but to have been originally piled, one upon another, appa- 
rently in the rude manner in which they ftill remain.
The mean breadth of the 
bafe of this circle is about eight yards ; and in no part of it does it appear ever to 
have varied much.
Its mean height is about four feet ; but this varies, from fix feet to 
three, or lefs.
This variation, it is probable, is owing to a praifliice, continued from 
ftge to age, of tumbling fome of thefe ftones, for amufement, down the fides of the 
mountain ; and it is not incurious to fee and hear them thus rolling and bounding 
along, with a perpetually incrcafing velocity.
The largeft of the ftones here piled 
up, would weigh, it is probable, four hundred weight; fome three, fome two, and 
fome one hundred weight ,* and fo downwards to about five pounds.
In general, 
however, they confift of ftones of the larger lizes : and, by comparing thole ftones 
that are below, or without, the pile, with the few which are to be found within what 
may be called the inclofcd area, it would feem that the whole circle is compofed of 
ftones taken from within the area ; which, in general, is deftitute of vegetation, 
excepting fome few fcanty tufts of ftunted ling on the north ; on the louth there is 
a little earth, of a dark-brown hue, and a few fmall ftones.
The diretftion of this 
ridge, or top, of Carrock, is E.
by W.
and W.
by N.
: and its longeft, or tranfverfe, 
diameter, running in the fame dirediion, meafures two hundred and fifty-two yards, 
•within the furrounding pile of ftones: the ftiorteft, or conjugate, diameter is an 
hundred and twenty-two yards; and the area, or contents, of the fpace thus inclofed, 
is four acres, three roods, and thirty-eight perches.
Oppofite to each end of each 
diameter, there are palTages, or ways, through what may be called the wall, into 
the inclofure.
The two at the weft end and the fouth fide arc, each, four yards 
wide: that at the eaft end feems to have been, at firft, of the fame width; but, 
owing, it is probable, to fome removal of fome of the ftones, it is now fix yards 
wide.
That on the north fide, notwithftanding that there are ftill left in it a few 
of the larger earth-faft ftones, is eight yards wide: fo that, if this ever was a 
palfage of four yards wide, vaft quantities of ftones muft have been taken away to 
bring it to what it now is.
Belides thefe, on the north-w eft quarter, there either is 
another large aperture, or palTage, twelve yards wide; or elfe this particular part

I'he idea is not to be reconciled ; a folution 
of copper by aquafortis, will tinge iron a bright copper-colour ; — but we never heard of any experiment 
that could prove what is vulgarly afferted.

never was completed.
And, indeed, by attending to the nature of the ground 
immediately w'ithni the inclofure here, it mufi; have been more difficult to procure 
ftones for this parr, than for any other: for, adjoining to this parr, there is a 
confiderable plot of earth, of the nature of peat-mofs, fcantily co\’ered with mofs 
and flubbed ling, and totally devoid of ftones.
At the diftance of iixty-fix yards from the eaft end of the oval pile jufl deferi- 
bed, and on the top of the ridge, ftands another ifolated pile of Rones, with a bafe 
about eleven yards in diameter, and appearing, at a little diftance, in the form of 
the fruRum of a cone.
But, clambering up to its top, it is found to be funnel- 
fhaped, the top of the funnel being five yards in diameter ; and it gradually fl'opes 
down two feet into the ground, being about tw'o feet wide at the bottom: and 
the bottom is feven feet perpendicular below the top of the funnel.
The largeR 
Rones in this pile may feem to be about one hundred weight and a half ; and, by’ 
their appearance, are of the fame kind as, and coeval with, thofe in the larger fur- 
rounding pile.
The crow ned head of old Carrock is itfelf by no means perfedlly 
uniform ; the end to the weRward being about thirteen yards higher than the 
middle of the oval.
Its highcR point is about ten yards from the weR end, and 
within it.
And here, there is a piece of rock proje^ing about three yards above 
the furface of the ground.
On two of the fides of this rock, or fragment of a rock, 
about as many Rones are piled up, as are contained in the other lefTer pile, juft 
deferibed.
This gives this higheR point, at a diRance, fomewhat the appearance 
of a fruRum ; though of twice the fize of the other.
Thefe Rones alfo appear to 
be of the fame kinds as the others, and to have lain as long.
Another fupcrinduced 
pile, evidently of modern contrivance, has yet been raifed on this, which has a rock 
for its foundation.
It is about two feet and a half fquare, and three feet high; and 
is called the IVeJf Pikcy or Peak, to diRinguifh it from another ere(Rion, of a like 
nature, and alfo of modern fabrication, about an hundred and twenty yards to the 
eaflward of the eaR end of the oval.
This laR is on much lower ground, and is 
about eight feet high, and perhaps three feet fquare at its bafe.
Thefe erections are 
fuppofed to be ornaments to the mountain, as well as to the circumjacent country ; 
and are called Men, few mountains being without them.
And now, having given the beR account in our power of this hitherto undeferi- 
bed, though certainly not unintereRing, veRige of great antiquity, our hardeR talk 
yet remains ; that we mean of afeertaining when, and for what purpofe, a work of 
Rich immenfe labour was undertaken.
Before we attempt, however, to fay w hat 
it is, it may not be unnecefTary to remove fome notions haRily taken up about it, 
and to decide what it is not.
And, firR, as there neither is, nor ever can have been, any vegetable productions 
within the inclofure, it could not be intended, nor ufed, for any purpofes of 
paRurage.
Nor could it well have been defigned, or maefe ufe of, as a place of.
protection for cattle, in the ages of mofs-trooping violences: for, befides that its 
wall of circumvallation was unnecefTarily large, and, after all, not a fufficient fence, 
even now it would be difficult and hardly poflible to drive cattle into it.
Still lefs 
could it be intended as a place of retreat for men, in cafes of invafion : there is no 
water, naturally, nor could a well be dug ; and the fence is too low for any idea of

brink of the fteep, which, when entire, was of confiderable ftrength, as appears from the materials.
The wall has been built without mortar, of large flat ilones ; it inclofes an area of 1000 paces In cir-

eight yards ; and, by the ftoues on the furface, It may be computed, that there are about four fothers

But there 
are no roads near this mountain ; no notice in any of our hiflorics, nor any other 
evidence, of any Roman legions, or cohorts, having ever been flationcd in this 
diflridl : add to this, its form, and, above all, the huge mafs of rude flones, fo 
utterly unlike any Roman remains, are much againfl this conjedlure.
Attending 
only to one of the interior piles, the mnft obvious conclulion would be, that this 
was a Cairn ; as it is at leafl poffible, the other lefTer one might alfo be, notwith- 
ftanding the large fragment of a rock, on which it is founded, and which, moft 
probably, vvas never placed there by man, but is coeval with the mountain.

After removing

— The view from 
“ this mountain is very exterifive ; it affords a profpefl of near twenty miles northward Into Scotland, and 
over Northumberland many miles to the fouth-eaft.” 
It is obferved, that “ it cannot be conceived, from the loftinefs of the mountain, the difficulty of 
<( accefs, the coldnefs of that high region, and the Inclemency of the weather it is naturally fubjed to, 
to have been ufed as a place of ftrength : from thefe natural caufes alfo, it Is not probable It (hould be 
ufed as a place for fecuring cattle and flocks againft the Incurfionsof an enemy ; — it might reafonably, 
from its very nature, be admitted to be ufed for religious offices.
The interior circumvallatlon appeals 
calculated for the exclufion of the vulgar from the principal feene of religious rites, where the priefts 
and chief perfonages only mlniftered.
The wall which forms the grand inclofure of the whole crown of

the high places of the ancients, and the titles appropriated to the fun.

perfons, are of the remoteft antiquity, and have been found in all countries: in 
thefe kingdoms, they leem to have been prior even to barrows, or mounds of earth, 
raifcd for the fame purpole 5 to which, it is probable, recourfe was had at firff, 
from a fcarcity of ftones.
They are fuppofed to have been formed, chiefly, in 
commemoration of heroes, when every foldier, as a token of his refpecft, carried a 
Hone to lay on his grave ; as, in other countries, they are faid to have carried, 
each, a little earth in his helmet, to raife a tumulus, or perpetual memorial, to a 
(lain general, or chieftain.
But it is the well-founded opinion of that eminent antiquary, Mr. Rowlands, in 
his Mona Aniiqua Rejlaurata, that cairns, or, as he more accurately fpells the 
word, Carnedde, were both fepulchres, and places of religious worfhip; as, in fome 
fenfe, churches alfo Hill are.
Of the fmaller cairns, or little heaps of ftones, found 
all over England, Ireland, and Scotland, and perhaps in all other countries, now 
often covered and hid by being overgrown with thorns and bufhes, or by a grafly 
turf of light mold or earth, Rowlands readily admits, that the tradition may be 
right , and that they were only the graves, or monuments, of eminent men.
But 
where their bulk and circumference, as in the prefent inftance, were prodigious ; 
and fuch as no army that ever was in this ifland could have brought together, in 
any common fpace of time, he contends, that they are to be regarded, as no other 
than “ the remains and monuments of ancient facrifices, the politive rites of 
“ religion and worfhip at thofe times.” 
And though,” as he adds, “ the particular manner and circumftances of that 
fort of worfhip, viz.
by throwing and heaping of ftones, are found extant in no 
records at this day, except what we have of the ancient manner of worfhipping 
Mercury in that manner; yet fome hints there are of it in the moft ancient 
*• hiftory of Mofes, particularly in that folemn tranfadion between Laban and 
Jacob, which may be fuppofed to be an ancient patriarchal cuftom, that obtained 
univerfally in thofe early ages ; and confequently might and did, as the vifible 
“ remains of it ftill vvitnefs, prevail in remoter countries alfo, and even in this of 
which we are now treating.
The pafTage 1 offer for it is very plain, and full to the purpofe, as to thofe 
** countries which Mofes mentions.
And while our monuments agree exadly 
w'ith thofe deferiptions, I take it not to be unreafonable to aferibe them to the 
fame caufes.

“ This whole affair has no fcmblance of a new inftitution, but is rather a par- 
ticular application to a general practice ; becaufe concluded by a facrifice, the 
higheft act of their religion, and not to be attempted by every private fancy: 
** and not only concluded by a facrifice, but that facred adlion feems to have been 
" a main part of it, and the chief end for which it was iniHtuted ; and, together 
with the other circumftanccs, made up one folemn religious ceremony.
“ Now, by what appears from the context, this whole tranfaclion w’as a religious 
“ ceremony, inftituted to adjuft and determine rights and poffeffions in thofe 
“ times betw’een different parties and colonies.
And as it feems to have been one 
“ of thofe Noachidum Statula, or ffatutes of the fons of Noah, as they^were called; 
" fo it is likely that the colonyzing race of mankind brought and carried with 
“ them fo neceffary an appurtenance of their peace and fecurity of living, as this 
“ inflitution was, wherever they came to fix and fettle themfelves; — that they 
“ carried at leaf!
the fubftance of the ceremony, though they might here and there 
“ vary in fome rules of application ; or perhaps pervert it to other ufes than what 
“ it was defigiied and intended for.” 
This argument is fo full, and appofite to our purpofe, that little remains to be 
added, in fupport of the conclufion, which we own we think the premifes fairly 
warrant us to draw from it ; viz.
that Carrock, like Lovg-Meg znd Mayborough [fee 
our firfl volum.e, p.
250, &c.
and p.
310] was alfo a court, or confifiory, of 
druidical ad mi niff ration, both in temporals and fpirituals.
Its near refemblance 
of Mayborough in particular, firongly confirms this conclufion, as its name alfo 
does.
The term cairn, or rather its Hebrew primitive keren-nedh, whence the 
Celtic and Welfli carnedde, literally fignifies a cooped heap: and Carroek, when 
analyzed, as naturally and clearly refolves itfelf into Cir-rock, a circle of ffones, 
the true theme, in the opinion of many, of the northern wmrd kirk, or church : and 
it is not a little remarkable, that the name given to the monument, by the country 
people, is The Sunken Kirks.

That our readers may be better enabled to judge forthemfelves of the true nature 
of this very extraordinary, though hitherto little noticed, monument of a very remote 
antiquity, and alfo be enabled to determine, to how much regard our conjedlures 
concerning it are entitled, a drawing of it is hereunto annexed: on w hich the only 
farther remark that feems to be neceffary is, that the cllipfis is a more uniform and 
perfecfl figure on the infide, than it is without, a circumfiance which could not 
well be miarked in a flight drawing ; and that, in general, the wall, or mafs of

Not far from Carroek, at Halt-Clofe bridge, the Caldew takes a fubterraneous

It is a water-fall, in a narrow gill, or dell, at the bottom of which runs the 
Caldew, over which a natural bridge of limeftone rock is formed.
Through the 
narrow arches of this bridge, the ftream rufhes, with infinite impetuofity ; and 
dafhing along over other rocks, it excites that fine found of falling water, which art 
has lo often attempted, almoft in vain, to imitate; and then empties itfelf into a 
large bafon, or pool, which feems to boil in various whirling eddies, covered with 
a white foam.
All water-falls are interefting ; but this feems to be particularly 
fo, becaufe, befides the additional grandeur it derives from its fituation, it is not 
fo large nor tremendous, (though fufficiently fo, perhaps, for real fublimity and

This place is, as might be fufpeded, the fceneof fundry fuperftitious notions and

Mines and Minerals.
— It appears that, fo long ago as the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth, mines were opened and worked on Caldbeck Fells^ though the ore is 
faid to have been carried to the great work at Kefwick, to be fmelted: and the 
proverb, that 
“ Caldbeck Fells 
” Are worth all England elfe,”* 
is dill older.
Something like a fatality appears to have attended the attempts 
hitherto made to explore the fuppofed depot of immenfe wealth.
In the reign of 
Elizabeth, when the Earl of Northumberland feemed determined to carry on the 
works here and at Newlands with fpirit, he was checked by an ill-timed law-fuit, 
refpeding the royalty of thefe mines ; the ilTue of which w as in favour of the 
crown, which, how-ever, has never derived any advantage from it ; unlefs it was 
an advantage to deter fubjedls from dabbling with the ore, which Mr. Robinfon 
informs us was emphatically called gowd-fcalp.
Once more, however, hopes arc 
entertained, that, at length, the mines on thefe fells may turn to good account.

William Row e, Efq. is laid lately to have difeovered, on the fouth fide of the High

for new attempts on the copper-mines at Hay-Gill.
It was the fagacious obfervation of Mr. Robinfon, in his Natural Hifiory of thefe 
two northernmoft counties, that feams of coals feldom lie on the tops of moun- 
tains, but upon heaths near mountains, where the declivities and inequalities of 
the furface give an advantage in the driving of levels.
Accordingly, all over this

neighbourhood, even if none were obtained from the neighbouring colliery on 
Warnel-Fell ; both of them, it is probable, being the fame flratum or feam.
Mr, Richard Simpfon, of Caldbeck, who appears to be pradically well acquainted 
with the fubjed:, has obligingly favoured us with the following fketch of the 
natural hiftory of coal in this neighbourhood.
At a place called IJc ale -Bridge ^ the bed of the river is burning limeftone ; by 
“which is meant, that limeftone w'hich will burn to lime; and which is here 
generally found under the coal : above it, are feveral ftrata, called limeftone; 
“ but they are not of a kind to burn to lime.
This ftratum of burning limeftone, 
“ feen in the bed of the river, continues to rife in a body to Park-Head, nearly an 
“ hundred and fifty fathoms.
The next ftratum above the burning limeftone is, 
“ what the pit- men call under-Jills^ an hard freeftone, full of fire, when ft ruck with 
“ a pick-axe.
This is generally mixed with fome black metal.
Then comes on 
** Warnel-Fell coal, at thirteen yards above the burning limeftone ; the dip of 
** which is one yard in fix, from S.
E. to N.

<• The coal, or feam, found in this pit, is about fixteen inches thick : and yet it is 
aftonifliing what quantities of coal are got even from fo fmall a band.
Thepit- 
men, having but this fpace of fixteen inches to work, are careful to pick out every 
** particle of coal ; which they call lying her in.
And after they have done their 
day’s work as to coal, they then take their hammers and wedges, and fell down 
“ about twelve inches of the roof left above the fpace from whence they have 
“ picked the coal ; in order, as may be imagined, to give themfelves a little more 
“ room to get to and from the feam of coals.
This roof in general confifts of a 
“ black flate metal ; and they form of it a fort of wall behind them, which prevents 
the roof from tumbling in, as elfe it might do, inafmuch as they feldom leave 
“ any pillars to fupport it.”

thoufand fheep that are fhorn ; whofe yearly produce of lambs is reckoned at two 
thoufand and four ; and the flieep of this parifli are counted to be the floutefl: and belt 
in the county.
In feveral of the eftates of the parifh, the flock of fheep is confidered 
as a fort of heirloom belonging to the eftate ; being fold and bought along w ith the 
land, and alfo leafed out along with it, when the land is let; the tenant being 
bound to deliver, on the termination of his leafe, as many as he receives, and of 
the fame kind, age, or quality.
It would indeed hardly be poflible to carry on 
farms like thefe, to any good purpofc, were it not for this cuftom ; as every parti- 
cular flock knows, and is tenacious of, its own particular walk, or diftrid of 
paflurage, on the heath.
Infinite trouble and confufion are thus prevented : and 
nothing is wanting to make the fyflem complete, and the parilh of Caldbeck one 
of the firrt fhcep-walks in the kingdom, hardly inferior perhaps to the fo celebrated 
plains of Andalufia, but that, by making their inclofed and cultivated lands co- 
operate with thofe that are uninclofed and wafle, they fhould render, as they eafily 
might do, their flocks of flieep both larger and better.
In all mountainous diflridls, 
the climate muff necelTarily be harfh, and of courfe unfavourable to corn : it is alfo 
one of the properties of limeflone land (and it has already been noticed, how much 
Caldbeck abounds with limeftone) to retard, if not totally prevent, the ripening of 
corn : hence, it is not uncommon to fee, in thefe diftridts, corn flill green even late 
in Oiflobcr.
All thefe things make much againfl the attemping to raife much 
corn in fuch countries; and almofl: as much for the turning the lands to grafs.
— 
No grafs is fweeter, or more fattening, than that which grows on limeftone land ; 
and certainly none better adapted to flieep.
If then more of the lands were turned 
into grafs, and all that is proper for the purpofe mow’ed, there would, of courfe, 
be a vaft increafe of fodder in the winter for fheep ; the flocks of w hich might 
then be doubled, trebled, or quadrupled.
And if alfo a little more care were taken 
to feletft the proper breeds, and to raife only good lambs, inftead of the uncertain 
and fcanty crops derived from the prefent difficult fyftem of management, farming 
would be lefs dependent than it now’ is on feafons and accidents ; and the farmers 
of Caldbeck would reap all the advantages of their advantageous fituation.
The w'eftern parts of the inclofed land is an heavy, poachy, cold foil : bur the 
fields immediately around the towns of Caldbeck and Hefket are higher and more 
fertile.
Still oats are the principal crop they aim at: and wheat and barley are 
fow’n only on the rich lands that lie near the river.
There are, as ufual, potatoes in 
plenty ; but, it may be queftioned, whether the whole parifh contains an acre of 
turnips.
Though the cultivated land cannot properly be called hilly, it is ftill farther 
from being level.
It feems to rife regularly and gently from the vale up to the 
mountains.
The hedges near the towns are planted with thorn, and are kept 
well : nearer the hills, the fields are more inclofed by ftone walls.
But this whole 
traift of country running much into wood, and being alfo well w’atered, cannot but 
be fertile and beautiful.
Two years ago the annual produce of the ftock of the parifh was 6924 fheep 
fttorn ; 2004 lambs ; 38 foals, and 381 calves.

1060 Bibles.
Of thefe, 16 were to be given, every year, to this parifh; but, wc 
are informed, that it now receives only 12.

The 
years, at Hagley.
He was of Oxford college : Dr. Shaw was head of the hall where he finiflied his 
fludies.
He was married young to a lady of Worcefter, but they had no iffue.
Mrs. Wilmot died 
many years before him — Mr. Wilmot was collated to the living of Caldbeck, by Bilhop Lyttleton, in 
1765 ; but, by the fudden death of that prelate, he dropt all further thoughts of preferment in the 
church : he could not enjoy the fport of the field, and thence, it is faid, he betook himfelf to hulbandry, 
by draining his glebe lands, which contained 1 50 acres, and much of it of a coarfe and barren nature.
— 
The firft ftep he took to improve thofe lands was, by drawing his tithe corn and hay throughout the 
parKh, which enabled him to purchafe cattle for winter-ftock, and thereby he procured large quantities 
of manure.
He ufed to fay, that manure was the foul of hulbandry, and always ufed lime with a fparing 
hand ; not more than 25 Carlifle bulhels upon an acre.
He likewife ufed to fay, that lime had no 
other principle, but to meliorate and pulverize the foil, thence to help the tender plants to vegetate ; as he 
always found, by experience, that too much lime in hulbandry bad one very bad effedl, viz.
of forcing all 
the oil and falts out of the manure and earth into the plants, which alw'ays kept the corn green in this 
cold climate.
— By thofe means, he obtained amufement for himfelf, bread for the induflrious poor, and 
a great improvement to thofe who attended to the cultivation of their eftates : fome of the land is now 
let for twenty (hillings an acre, that was not, before his time, worth five (hillings.
— He likewife let the 
pari(hioners fee, that nothing would anfwer their purpofe, in the management of their lands, but fummer 
fallowing, which has been praftifed with fuccefs.
In the year 1785, Mr. Wilmot pulled down the old reflorial houle, which w'as of a great length, and 
appeared to have been built by former reftors, juft as they had large or fmall families.
In the middle of 
the houfe, there was a large room, called the dining-room ; but it had more the appearance of a chapel 
than any thing elfe : — befides, there were the arms of a bi(hop carved upon one of the beams.’* — In one 
year this old building was taken down, and a handfome and convenient houfe was erefted in the place of 
it.
— Mr. Wilmot did not live to fee it finilhed : his health began to impair, and he retired to Worcefter, 
and there ended his days.
— He was a man of great knowledge, and unlverfal reading.
— Having a hand- 
fomc fortune of his own, he was enabled to keep an houfe of old Englifli hofpitality.
— He died, univerfally 
regretted by his parKhioners, in the 60th year of his age.
In this pari(h was born Robert Sewell, of Bridge-Houfe, in the parKh of Caftle-Sowerby.

it to the royal forefl: of Inglewood, as appears from the following extrad of the 
perambulation in the 29th year of the reign of King Edward I.
— Alanus, filius 
Waldevi, quondam dominus de Allerdale, dedit domino Henrico regi proavo 
“ domini regis nunc, cervum et cervam, aprum et capreolum, inter Shauk et Alne, 
“ ficut Alne cadit in mare ; et idem Alanus dedit dido domino Henrico regi folum 
cum herbagio in libera chafea de Allerdale, viz.
per has divifas; de Wafpatrick 
wath afeendendo ad locum ubi Shauk cadit in Wathempolc, ei de illo loco ufquc 
“ ad caput de Shauk, et de illo loco ufque ad Rowland bek heved’ et de illo loco 
“ ufque ad Randolphfete, et de illo loco ufque ad caput de Thornethwayte bek, et 
de illo loco ufque ad locum ubi Thornethwayte bek cadit in Waver, et de illo 
loco afeendendo ufque ad magnum iter inter folum domini regis et folum de 
Waverton, et fic inter folum domini regis et folum de Wyggeton, et fic de folo 
de Wyggeton ufque ad Troutbek, et de Troutbek in Wathempole, et de 
Wathempole afeendendo ufque Wafpatrick wath.” — It feems that this tracT of 
land, after it was joined to Inglewood, gained the name of the West Ward, or 
weftern ward of the forelfer’s charge within the forefl.
The forefl; of Weftward having been granted to King Henry 11 .
continued in 
the crown till the time of King Edward III.
who, in the 17th year of his reign, 
granted the fame to Thomas Lucy, on his marriage with the king’s coufin, Agnes 
de Beaumont, to them and the heirs of their bodies, by the following inftrument — 
Charta domini regis Edwardi tertii fadla Thomae de Lucie et Agneti uxori fuse

how it was endowed, o by whom it was founded, or what number of reclufe, and 
in what fucceflion, wei e there, we have no evidence.
— It exifted, and was of fomc 
value, in the 12th century; for King John, in the i 6 ch year of his reign, granted 
it to the abbey of He m Cultram, in thefe words — DedilTe concelfifle, et hac

— In the 
reign of King Henry III.
Thomas de Lafcells, Lord of Bolton, by his confirmatory 
deed, reciting the grant of King John, confirmed to the abbot and monks of 
Holm Cultram this hermitage.
The monks fliewed its importance, by the venera- 
tion they paid to it, in founding there a chapel, or oratory, which, in courfe of 
years obtained parochial lights, though furrounded with a forefi, which, in its 
original nature, was extraparochial : and fuch was the rife of this parifh.*

The parifli confifts of the following townihips, or divifions, Brocklebank, 
Rofley, Woodfide, Stoneraife, and llekirk.
The country in the divifion of Brocklebank is hilly, and has much wood.
It 
is divided from Reedthwaite by Silverbeck, which, meeting with Wifa beck at the 
north end of Weftward park, in one ftream they fall into Wampool below Wigton.
There is plenty of coal here, (fome of the kennel kind) at Shawkhead, Lowpgill, 
and Weftward park.
This divifion comprehends Haglethorp, Tonguethwaite, 
and Clea.
— Clea was the feat of a younger branch of the Mufgraves of Crookdake; 
by intermarriage with the female heir, the inheritance paffcd to the Fletchers of 
Dearham ; and is now the property of Sir Henry Fletcher, Bart.
Member of 
Parliament for the county of Cumberland.
Rosley is divided from Brocklebank by Wifa beck.
— Here a fair is held on 
Whitfun Monday, and every fortnight day alter till the day of All Saints, for horfes, 
cattle, fheep, cloth, and other merchandize.
WooDsiDE is another divifion, where Sir Wilfrid Lawfon and Sir John Brifco 
of Crofton have an undivided lordfliip of cuftomary tenure, under arbitrary 
fines.
Stoneraise is the divifion in which the Roman ftation lies known in the 
country by the name of 0/<^ Carlijle.
Ilekirk is faid to be a corruption of St. Hilda’s Kirk, from the hermitage 
before mentioned.

This family foon after was reduced to female iffue, and 
the eftate, after pafiing by fale through leveral hands, at length became the 
pofleftion of Jofhua Lucock, Efq.*" 
In the 22d year of his reign, granted to the prior and convent thefe tithes recovered, and all tithes

The church of Westward!
was certified to the governors of Queen Anne’s 
bounty at 23I.
a year, and the income doth not now exceed 30I.
The next objedt of our attention, is the Roman ftation called 
OLD CARLISLE.
On the level green, a little below the Ration, foot-races are Rill kept up, and the 
diRances are denoted by hillocks, on one of which a poR is now fixed.
We con- 
ceive, in this race is preferved a Roman cuRom, and the ancient gaols are pointed 
out to us by the hillocks; which are apparently artificial, but too fmall to be 
tumuli.
The remains of the Ration are very extenfive, foundations of innumerable 
buildings being fcattered over many acres, as well within the vallum as on every 
hand without, except to the weRward, where the ground defcends precipitately to 
the brook Wifa.
This Ration is an oblong fquare, one hundred and feventy paces 
in length, and one hundred and ten in breadth, with obtufe angles, defended by 
a double ditch, with an opening, or approach, in the centre of each fide; the 
whole ground difeovers a confufion of ruined edifices.
Camden fays — “ Below the monaRery (Holm Cultram) the bay receives little 
“ Waver, increafed by the Wize, a fmall river, at the head of which the melan- 
choly ruins of an ancient city teach us, that nothing in this world is out of the 
** reach of Fare.
By the neighbouring inhabitants it is called Old Carlisle ;* 
but

Of whom it’s faid, none here livd’d more approv’d, 
None died more mifs’d, none mifs’d was more belov’d.
Whofe virtuous wife in fable thoughts doth mourn 
Her tui tie’s lofs, till laid near to his urn.

Without grand ilfue, be reduc’d to mould.
Nor can they well, while here they leave a name, 
Shall them furvive, till them revive again.

follow Camden’s copy, compared with that in Gruter’s Corpus.
It is reprefented in Camden as a grand

For fpying of an enemy^ you could not have a more con- 
“ venient

The altar is infcribcd to Jupiter optimus maximus, and erected by the ata that was called 
yiugujla Gordiana on account of their valour.
The then legate and proprietor is named in it Nonnius 
Philippusi and the coniuls Atticus and Prxtextatus, which fixes the time to the year 242.
Both this 
date and the infeription itfelf, determine It to the reign of the Emperor Gordian the third, whofe wife s 
name was TranquHlina.
Capitolinus and Eutropius agree in affirming, that Gordian, the fon and grand- 
fon of Gordian, married when very young, and before he engaged in war.
The former fays his wfife was 
the daughter of Mifitheus, the latter calls her Tranqullina.
Mr. Gale, in his remarks on the inferiptions 
found at Lanchefter, in the county of Durham, fuppofes the ala Augufta to be part of the legio fexta 
vidlrh ; Old Carlifle Is a long way from York where the legion was ftatedly quartered ; and ala upon 
inferiptions, as well as in Tacitus, fignifies rather fome auxiliary horfe than the legionary.
This 
Aa was at this time commanded by JErnilius Crifpinus, an African, a native of Tufdrus, the place 
where the eldeft Gordian was made emperor.
Capitolinus, who informs us of this, calls It Tyfdrus, and 
others write it otherwife ; fo alfo do they write varioufly' the name of the province in which it was 
fituated, Byzaciuin, Byzacina, or Byzacena.

from Camden, I.

HONOREM VX 0 RI 3 GORDIANI, to have been the fame with this, 
in which (he is mentioned.
“ There have been however other altars found here, eredled by the fame ala, two of which defcribed 
in Camden, and referred by him to this place, are now at Drumbrugh, which will be confidered under 
the following numbers.
And it is a miftake in Mr. Gordon, to fay the inferiptions at Drumbrugh 
cafile were brought from Allonby.
For the four next are the only legible Inferiptions that I could meet 
with at Drumbrugh ; and It is certain, from Camden’s tellimony, that ihefe belong to Old Carlifle.

“ This altar is in the weft wall of the garden ; part of it has been broken off, but fo luckily as to do 
no great damage to the infeription, which is yet legible.
This copy (which 1 took as carefully' as I could 
from the original) differs a little both from that Iti Camden, and in the Philofophical Tranfadfions.
The 
difference lies chiefly in the fifth line.
Camden has it IN — G — N, as If fome letters were wanting between 
thofe that are fet down.
In the Tranfaftlons It is I.ING — N, as if an O had been omitted to make it 
Lingonenfis ; and both make the laft letter in the preceding line to be a P.
But what they make an N 
appeared to me an M, when I examined it narrowly ; nor could I difeern the fore part of the P in the 
preceding line, fo that it feemed to me like an though it is poffible the head of the P may be worn 
off.
However I am certain there are no letters wanting in the fifth line, nor any room for more, and 
the laft ftroke of the N feemed evidently to include an I In It, as there mult alfo be an I included in the 
N in 'JuJiinus, But I leave it to others to read and judge as they pleafe ; for my own part, if provincia 
Lingonenft be the reading, I could by no mean.s make it out, when 1 had the altar before me, and 
endeavoured to do it.
Though if Lingonenfis be the word, I would rather make it out by fuppofing the 
laft letter In the preceding line to have been an L and to be joined to thofe in the following; for thus 
v/e have LING ; and the M after it may be pofiibly another name of 'Juflinus ; or, as Mr. Ward con- 
jedlures, it may be read Lingonum municipii or municeps.
There is another difference In the laft line, 
the find two letters of which appeared to me not II but ET.
And there feems to be no other proof 
but this Infeription, that Tufeianus was oftner coivful than once.
However the names of the conful* 
feem to give the year 188 for the date of the infeription, according to the Chrilllan aera.

becaufe he takes no notice of it, and copied the whole without any difficulty ; whereas that line is no\r 
much damaged by the frafture, and hard to be read.
This altar has been etefted by the fame ala, and 
to the fame deity, as the laft, but at a different time, when Aproiiianiu and Bradua were confuls, in the 
year 191, under the reign of Commodui; at which time they had changed their commander, who was 
now Publiuf JElius Magnus, the fon of Publius, of the tribe Sergia mentioned in Virgil, and town of 
Murfa, in the lower Pannonia.

“ I take it for granted it muft be the fame with that which Camden deferibes, and fays was found on 
the military way, not far from Old Carlifle, and was at that time to he feen at Thorefby.
It agrees 
with Camden’s in all refpedls, as to every word and letter, and the pofition of them ; and it is juft what 
he calls it, a pillar of rude ftone ; and the letters on it are rude and unevenly cut.
The fecond ftroke of 
the word IVL, in the feventh line (however it happened) is plainly fuper.duous, though clear and diftin£t 
upon the ftone.
1 take this to have been one of the military ftones that were eretfed at every mile’s end

“ Crifpus, to whofe honour this infeription has been eixAed, was fon of Conftantine the Great, and 
created Cxfar by him.
Some fay he was put to death by his father, at the inftigation of the Emprefs 
Faiijia; though this is queftloned by others.
Pie was ihiice conful when Cafar, as appears by the 
Fajli Confulares, namely, in the years 318, 321, and 324.
About this time therefore muft this pillar 
and Infeription have been eresfted.
In the Fajii Cosifulares he is called Flavius Falerius Crifpus Cafar, 
but upon his coins he is named Flavius yulius Crifpus.
And thus he feems to have been called here.
— 
This is the only infeription in Britain, where his name is mentioned, though there are fome nearly 
parallel to this, which may be feen in Goltzius and Gruter.
He is called the fon of Conftantine, and 
the grandfon of Conftantius ; and Conftantius is ftyled divus and pins.
Eutropins tells us “ tliat Con- 
“ ftantius died in Britain, at York, and was ranked among the divi.” — And Dr. Gale informs us, that 
“ many coins of the Roman emperors have been dug up at Comb, a mile from Kingfton ; the lateft of 
“ which was inferibed DIVO CONSTANTIO PIO.” I wonder much that this infeription, being 
amongft Sir Robert Cotton’s colleAiori, and yet remaining at Coningtoii, ffiould not have been publifhed 
before, and particularly that Camden fhoiiid have taken no notice of it.
Where this infeription was firft 
found, is not known ; but I leave it In this place, bccaufc I know not where to difpofe of it better.

Betides thefe, there are three inferiptions more in Camden, two of which, as I hinted be- 
fore, have probably been upon two altars that are at I^iumLrugh, but no vifiblc letters upon them now.
One of thefe altars Is built up In the garden wall ; and the other, whicli is of a very coarfe and reddith 
ftone, ftarrds in the hay-loft.
The former is the more beautiful, wliofe figure I have here given.
And 
as the following infeription feems to be the chief of the three, whofe originals are wanting, and appears 
alfo both as to the number and length of the lines, to fuit the fize of this altar, I believe it may formerly 
have belonged to it.
The words rim thus ; Deo fanUo Belatucadro Aurelius Diatova aram ex voto pofuit 
libentipjime sneritifime.
It feems plain that ARA in the fifth line muft be for ARAM.
Ex voto is 
ufual, and veto without the prepofiiion fonietimes occurs.
MM at the laft can be read no other wife than 
weritijfime.
This, together with its being more eafy and natural, has determined me to read LL 
libentipsne, rather than libens lubens.

Mr. Camden fays this infciiption and altar was at Wordal, the feat of Mr. Dykes ; and it may 
probably have been removed from thence to Drumbrugh.

The following Infcriptlon to a local diety is another of thofe in Camden : Deo Ceaiio Aurelius 
Eruracio pro fe et fuis votum folvit libentiffime merito.
— Ceaiius, if that be the true reading, muft be the 
name of fome local deity ; but the third line, which contains a part of the name of the perfon erecting 
the altar, is in confufion ; fo that I know not whether it has been Aurelius Martins et Martia Eruracio^ 
or Aurelius Martius Martii filius.
— Mr. Ward propofes the following reading of it.
“ Ceaiius is fo 
uncouth a name, that I can by no means think it the true reading.
I am much inclined to fancy the 
deity here defigned was Oceanus, and that the infcriptlon (Irould be read in the following manner : — 
Deo Oceana Aurelius Martius et Martia [or Marjla~\ Eruracio, &c.
The firft O of OCEANO 
“ might be near etfaced in Camden’s time.
The oblique ftroke of the N might likewife be fo faint as 
“ to make it appear like a double II.
Eruracio in the fourth line feems rather a woman’s name, and 
“ MS at the end of the line above it very probably is a midake, becaufe in Gruter it is writ MARS, 
“ where the A might be included in the M ; and we find both Marfm and Martia in him upon other 
“ Infcriptions.
I would fuppofe therefore that the infcriptlon was ereAed by this Martius and his wife to 
“ Oceanus, upon account of thcmfelves and their family, for their pafiage hither by fea.
That the antientt 
“ reprefented Oceanus as a deity, is plain from Virgil ; 
Occam libemus, aits fimul ipfa precatur, 
Oceanumque patrem rerum, Nympkafque forores.
“ I am not able to determine whether the fonner infciiption, or this next (defcribed alfo by Camden)

** Befides thefe, an infinite number of little images, fiatues on horfeback, eagles, 
lions, ganymedes, with many other evidences of antiquity, are daily dug up.” 
Within the vallum, towards the north, a well has lately been opened, about three 
feet diameter, walled regularly with ftone; around which are fcattered fragments 
of bricks, tiles, and earthen ware.
It was the opinion of Mr. Horfley and Mr. Warburton, that this ftation was 
the Olenacum, notwithftanding the contrary fentiments of other antiquaries, who 
placed it at Ellenborough : thefe judicious writers apprehended, that fuch fenti- 
ments 
4o6 
OLD CARLISLE.
ments had arofe merely from the affinity of names, Ellen and Olenacim.
Mr.
Horfley’s words are — The ruins of the old town and ftation here are very grand 
and confpicuous.
It ftands upon a military way, very large and vifible, leading 
diredily to Carlifle and the wall.
It is about one mile fouth from Wigton, about 
eight miles fouth-wcft from Carlifle, and about twelve or fourteen weft from 
Old Perith, and ten long ones eaft from Elenborough.
The ramparts of the 
" ftation lie, two of them diredlly eaft and weft, and the other north and fouth.
— 
There feems to have been a double agger quite round it.
The river Wiza runs 
on the fouth and weft fldes of the ftation, about half a mile from it, and the 
dcfcent to the river is fteep, yet the old buildings have been on all fldes here, as 
well as at Old Perith.
From this ftation there is a very large profpefl, efpecially 
“ weftward, reaching the fea.
The Wiza, on which Old Carlifle ftands, may be 
“ imagined to have fome affinity with Viroftdum, as well as the Elen with Olenacum, 
if the order of the Notitia did not difagree.
According to the Notitia, Olenacum 
“ was garrifoned by a body of horfe, called Ala Herculea ; and it appears, from 
infcriptions, that the Ala Augufta was long at Old Carlifle, under the Emperor 
Gordian : this Ala^ very probably, alTumed the name Gordiana in the year 242 ; 
“ and I am much inclined to think, that, about forty years after, this lame Ala 
took the name of Herculea, from the Emperor Maximianus Herculius.” 
Mr. Smith, in the Gentleman'^ Magazine for 1748, communicated the following 
difcoveries — “ I fend you fome pieces of antiquity which I lately difcoverd in the 
w^all and adjoining houfes of an obfcure farm at Coninggarth, about two fhort 
“ miles fouthward from Wigton, in Cumberland, and not lar from a large Roman 
encampment called Old Carlisle, on the military way leading to Ellenborough.
*• Old Carlifle has been varioufly underftood by antiquaries ; but Mr. Horfley’s 
opinion, that it w'as the Roman Olenaettm, feems to have the greateft weight, 
** where the Ala Herculea encamped in the time of the Notitia.

Is a 
“ Triton; the ftone is about two feet and a half long, by flxteen inches.
Whether 
there has been any figure on the other fide cannot be learned, as it is built in the 
wall : it is in full demi-relievo, and tolerably well executed, at leaft much better 
than many fculptures of thofe times : but it is imperfetft.
Below the tail has 
been another figure, but the ftone is broke off; and facing the Triton, a third, 
alfo defaced and imperfeeft.* No. 8.
Is the corner ftone of a ftable, or barn, at 
the very foundation; probably a pedeftaltoa funeral monument: the figures on it

the whole afepulchral pillar, is not now to be determined.
No. 9.

“ w'all of the ftable; the border is raifed, and the plane hollowed, in which this

1 take to be the capital of 
“ the whole monument: wrought over with a kind of net-work, probably taken

Its moft lingular curiofity is, that the plinth and

“ fpiking their globes.
I am perfuaded, had the whole funeral monument been 
entire, it w'ould have been one of the moft carious of its kind yet difcovered.”f

Is an infcripdon now placed horizontally as the upper lintel of a window*

In the Gentleman’s Magazine for the fame year, is the following paper, figned 
Corniibitnfis — “ I doubt your correfpondent, who has favoured the public with the 
“ fepulchral infeription, (p.
179) has not hit the right reading; particularly I 
" fufpedt the word Jov/s, w hich 1 liave great reafon to think was originally Equis, 
the ftrokes wanting to complete the two firfl: lettershaving, in all pro’oability, 
“ been obliterated through time.
What other mi flakes the cbfeurity of the inferip- 
“ tion has occafioned, will befl appear by the manner in which I fhould chufe to 
read it, wdiich is thus: — No. 12.
The fccond of the three lafl letters, which is 
“ taken for a C, is no other than an imperfed; T, the upper ftroke being worn out, 
and the fyllable feems to be part of the word, Slipendiavit^ as probably it might 
“ have been written, though not claflical, fo low in the empire as Gordian’s 
** reign, when, I.imagine, the infeription was made; or the words might have been 
originally, though now lofl, Stipendia fecit at length ; which feems the moft 
“ likely, /rtcere Snpevdia Equis being a known phrafe of Livy’s, as the abbreviating 
" letters, H.
S. E.
which commonly conclude thefe mionumental inferiptions, are 
“ here w'anting.
“ G.
S. agrees with CornubienfiSy that Jovis is really Equis ; but in the latter 
part fufpeds ALEAVGf to terminate the word ; it is clofe to the border, fo that 
the perpendicular ftroke of the G is loft by it, and no room remains for VSTE, 
“ to complete the word Aiignjice.
The laft line, he fays, is extremely fair after Aug.
“ viz.
SE SCI, but acknowledges himfelf at a lofs how to reconcile it to a tolerable 
reading with Equis ; nor is there the lead: veftige of the horizontal line of a T 
“ in the laft letter but one : he takes SE to be a word incomplete, becaufe there 
" is an interval, but no points betwixt it and SCI.” 
In the fame repolitory for the year 1755, we have the following account, 
figned G.
S. 
“ I fend you the beft drawing I could make of two Roman altars.

“ caftward a long w^ay.
" Some doubt has been made, what was the ancient name of this place; Mr.
“ Camden gives it no name, though he calls it a famous city : it is indeed moft 
probable that he never faw it, for there are no remains of buildings befides the

T he name of Sebergham, when analyzed, agrees, almofl; to a letter, with its 
etymology.
— Denton fpeaks of it thus— “ Sebergham is fo called of the 
“ place where it flands, which is a hill, or rifing ground, in the foreft of Engle- 
wood ; which of the weft ftdc was dry ground, or woodland, but the north-eafi: 
“ lide a wet, fpungy earth, covered with rufnes, which the country people calL 
f;e-ves * — and thereupon the place was called Seevy-burgh.
— Bcicre it was inha- 
bited, it was a foreft, and a great waftc or wildernefs at the conqueft.
After, at 
“ the latter end of King Henry II.
’s time, one William Waftall, or De le Waftall, 
“ began to inclofe fome parts of it : he was an hermit, and lived there to an 
" extreme old age, by the labour of his hands, and fruit-trees which he planted.
“ He came thither in King Henry l.’s time, and died about the end of King John’s 
“ time, or in the beginning of King Henry ill.
— King John granted him the Hill, 
and he left it to the Prior of Carlille.
The hermit’s grant was afterwards cqn- 
“ firmed by certain bounds under the feal of the King of Scots, to whom the King 
“ of England had given divers parts of the county in frank marriage.
— William 
Waftall had a chapel there, where the church now ftands, and a littile cell ; but, 
“ after his death, the prior let all forth to tenants and farmers, and enlarged the 
" church, and made it parochial, and the place and village now called ^ib/a de 
“ Sebergham and Langholm^ which is a long dale and low holme by the river of 
“ Cawdey, now' alfo inhabited and parcel of the foreft, and firft inclofed as pur- 
” prefture by the Forefters, the Raughtons, and others, fmcethe conqueft, and are- 
“ now, and of long time have been fo named, and as one tow nftiip, whereof the 
“ Kirkthwaites arc parcel.” Denton’s MS.
A more fimple etymology is to be obtained by the natural and obvious 
'terms of Jun and Jea^ which, in this county at leaft, are (and in diftant times were 
alfo in many others) equivalent to norlb feuth.
Thus, there is hardly a land- 
holder w ho has net a fea-crofl and a fun-crofl.
— Berg is the well-known Saxon 
term for an hill, as baniy or hamei alfo is for a place of abode, or permanent 
relidence.
— Nothing can be more appropriated, or more appofite, than this idea 
of the name of this place: neither the village, nor any confiderable part of the 
pariih, the land of which in general is high, and the foil gravelly, are Inch as to 
produce many rufhes, or fieves.
If the more ancient name of the place was 
Sebreibam, as it has long been and ftill is frequently fpelled, this can make no differ- 
ence in its etymology ; berg and brae both fignifying rifing ground, or an hill.
Form, Situation, Boundary, and Aspect.
-^If this parifh were inclofed, it 
might, with a particular propriety, be faid to be furrounded by a ringfencey its- 
form being nearly circular, and its circumference about fourteen miles.

next parifh to Dalfton, and the fartheft in Cumberland ward towards the fouth.
— 
On the ead:, north-eaft, and fouth, it is bounded by Caflle-Sowerby ; on the fouth 
and weft by Caldbeck; on the north-weft and on the north by Weft ward and 
Dalfton: the river Caldew, iftuing from Carrock, Skiddaw, and Caldbcck-Fclls, 
become its boundary twice, for a courfe of fome miles towards the eaft ; and the 
fmall ftream, or becky called Shawk, or Shalk, is its uninterrupted limit for a long 
courfe towards the weft and north-weft.
— Sebergham town is ten miles diftant 
from Carlifle, eight from Wigton, and tw-elve from Penrith ; and the people refort 
to each or a!!
of thofe markets indifterentiy, juft as it fuits their in'eiinations, or 
their interefts.
The eaftern part of this pa.'-ifti is w'oody; the weftern bleak and 
cold ; and the fouthern parts, lying higher, are perhaps ftiil colder.
It cannot 
properly be described as cither particularly hill or dale; yet it is wavy and undu- 
lating, and abounds wuth gentle Hopes.
Few diftriefts in any county can boaft of 
fweeier fituations than many that are to be met with in Sebergham.
A farm-houfc, 
belonging to Sir Henry Fletcher, attracls notice from its being caftellated, and 
alfo large and commodious; Graftgarth, fome time the neat and comfortable 
reftdence of Mr. Robfon, the cldeft brother of the refpeclable bookfcller of his 
name in Bond-ftreet ; Sebergham-Hall, now belonging to Thomas Rclph, Efq.
; 
a large and good houfe in Sebergham town, lately the hofpirable home of the late 
AVilliam Scott, Efq.
; and the inn and villa at the town head, belonging to Sir John 
Biifco, being all of them well planted and improved, are all places that challenge 
notice.
— Warnel-Hall alfo, long the feat of the Demons, (an ancient and refpedU 
able family of this county) is ftiil a noble manfion; being very advantageoufly 
fituated on a charming Hope of Warnel-Fell.
It formerly belonged to the Lord 
Dacres of Gililand ; and is 'now the property of the Earl of Lonfdale.
— At the 
weftern end of this old hall, there once was a pretty large and ftrong tower, faid to 
have been built by a Scots nobleman, as the condition of his ranfom.
Tradition 
deferibes him as having been taken prifoner, by one of the Dentons, the thcnownci* 
of this leat, at the battle of Flodden-Field, in 1513.
The tower, no doubt, 
was built on the fame principles, and for the fame reafons, which induced' a 
preceding owner to erc(ft a large beacon on the fame ground, and which filled the 
county, at Icaft in the border diftritfls, with beacons and uoatih-bills, viz.
that of 
apprizing the country of any invafions, or inroads, from the borderers on the Scots 
fide of the Solway Frith, in thofe unhappy times, when the two countries were 
perpetually defolating each other by prtedarory incurfions.
It w'as from the cir- 
cumftance of this beacon, or this tower, or both, that the place is fuppofed, and 
not without reafon, to have got its name ; IVarneil having originally been Warn- 
Hill.
— The memory of this battle is ftiil preferved among the traditionary ftorics 
of the Englilh borderers ; who concur with the author of the long poem of the 
Battle of Fiodden, publifhed by Mr. Lamb, in believing that it w’as “ in Auguft 
“ month this broil befell;” though Lindfay of Pitfeottie favs exprcfsly that the 
battle v/as fought on the ^th of September; and the harveft of that year is ftiil 
fpoken of in Cumberland under the appellation of the IVkite Harvejl ; lb called, as 
is fuppofed, from the circumftance,* that the young men were draughted to go to 
this battle, juft when, they Ihould have gone to reaping, leaving the corn to be

JJjorn^ or reaped, only by perfons with grey, or white, hairs : fo that, in the words 
of the fwcetefl of all fwect fongs, “ that year 
“ In har’ft at the Ihearing, nae fwankies were jeering, 
*' Their banllers were wrinkled, and lyart and grey.” 
If this tr^ldirion may be relied on, (and, in the abfence of any contrary teftimony, 
even tradition becomes a fort of hillorical evidence) it not only illuflrates the 
above-quoted paflage from the fong, but alfo gives feme additional weight to the 
arguments of thofc, who contend, that the fong w’as an Englifli compofition.
The fite of a place called Buh)ian-Hill, the eftate of Mr. Robert Jelferfon, (a re- 
fpedable man, in that clafs of men who ufed to be called the yeomanry, and who, in 
this county, are ftill known by the emphatical and (ignificant name of fiatefaien) is 
particularly ftriking.
The ground is elevated, the houfe is placed as it were, on the 
very pinnacle of a fummitj and the Caldew feems to wind femicircularly around 
it.
But there is one particular Ipot on an adjacent eflatc, now the property of the 
Rev. Mr.
Boucher, which is, if poflible, flill more happily fituated.
It takes in 
a fliir and advantageous view of two fine contiguous bridges, viz.
that at the fooc 
of Sebergham-Brow, and- that called Bell-Bridge.
And here too, the fine bold 
river Caudey, or Caldew, that flows beneath, alternately appearing and difappear- 
ing, interefis the beholder in an uncommon m.anner, by fuggefling to him fome- 
thing like a flattering fenfation, that he is indebted for the profpebl he enjoys, in 
fomc degree, to his own management and addrefs in catching thefe tranfienc 
glimpfes of the fiream, whether it will or no.
Here too are feen to great 
advantage fundry neat edifices, " embofomed deep in tufted trees and the 
banks of the river, which are every w'here woody and beautiful, are here particu- 
larly pidturefque and interefting:

“ With thickets overgrown, grotefqiie and wdld,” 
form, here, in the remaining words of this fi.ne paflage in Milton, 
“ Shade above fhade, a woody theatre 
“ Of fiatelieft view.” — 
The mountains of Scotland and Northumberland form the horizon of this 
charming landfcape.
Sebergham bridge was firfl erecTied, the year after the revolution, by Alexander 
Denton, Efq. Jufiice of the Common Pleas, who was of the Denrons of Warnel- 
Hall ; and whom Mr. Lyfons, in his well-executed Hiflory of the Environs of 
London, mentions as having pofleflTed a feat, called Ford Hook, in the parifh of 
Eating.
The prefent elegant and noble arch, forming Bell bridge, was ereded in 1772, 
in the place of a very feeble one, that was fwept away by a great flood in 1771 : — 
one of the moft memorable that are remembered in the north ; many vefliges of it 
are ftill to be feen.

The Church AND Matters appertaining to the Church.
— The church, 
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is fmall, but Angularly neat, and Rands pretty near 
the centre of this circular parifli.
Its Ate is fuppofed to be the very fpor, where 
an hermit, of the name of IVilliavt Wajlally or de IVafte-daley had his cell.
The ArA erection of a church here is probably coeval with WaAall’s^equeA, 
before noticed.
In 1774, the whole ediAcc had a thorough and complete repair; 
when alfo a gallery was eredled.
In 1785, the chancel was alfo repaired, by the 
prefent incumbent ; though there is a well-founded prefumption, that the eAate 
of Warnel-Hall is bound to contribute one half of the repairs of the chancel.
The 
parfonage houfe (which, though fmall, is not mean) was built anew in 1773, on 
the Ate of an old one, which had gone much to decay.
The dean and chapter of Carlifle are the impropriators of the reftory of Sebergham, 
and of courfeare the patrons, and appoint the mini Aer. The pari At is now a perpetual 
curacy.
It doth not occur in any of the ancient valuations ; in 1739, however, it 
was certiAed to the governors of Queen Anne’s bounty at 19I.
But, coming in, 
on the late inclofure of the common there, for a lot of thirty-Ax acres, and another 
eAate of nearly the lame quantity of land having been purchafed, with the money 
obtained by an augmentation by lot from the queen’s bounty, together w ith another 
200I.
from the fame noble fund procured by the advance of an equal fum given 
by John Simpfon, Efq. all helped out by a further handfome contribution from the 
parifh, the bcneAce was cAimated, twenty years ago, at tool, per annum.
The payment of tithes in this parilh is particularly ealy and pleafant : thefc 
payments confiA of but two modufes, the one called the ancient prefeription, 
amounting, in the whole, only to 9I.
is.
and the other, a modus, if it may be fo 
called, that is almoA unique in its kind, but fettled by an aft of parliament palfed 
in 1771.* 
It can hardly be necelTary to detail here, at any length, the almoA countlcfs 
advantages derived to this parifli, in various refpefls, from the inclo-fure of its 
commons : fuffice it to oblerve only, in this place, that the living has gained by 
it a clear nett annual income of two hundred and A\ty-feven bulhels, one peck, 
one quart, and one-fourth of a pint, of wheat, WinchcAer meafure ; and this paid, 
not only w'ithout any of the vexatious wranglings fo generally attendant on the 
colleflion of tithes in kind, but alinoA without a murmur.
* The feveral qaotas of wheat are fpecihed in a fehedule to the aft alluded to, and made part thereof ; 
it is divided into four feparate columns ; — the hrft comprehends the proprietors’ names ; the fecond is 
deferiptive of where the lands lie, and whether ancient or modern inclofures ; the third fpecifies the 
quantities of wheat to be for ever paid thereon ; and the fourth contains a flate of modus payments in 
itioney, which, by the aft, are perpetuated.
— The hrft cnafting claufe enforces the payment in grain, or 
in money, after the rate to be fet by the jury, at the Micliaclmas feffions annually ; or, on their default, 
after the rate and price of the markets of Carlifle, Penrith, and Cockermouth, Immediately after 
Michaelmas feifions, to be adjudged by the arbitrators, by the aft impowered fo to do.

owners, in proportions to their eflates : the dean and chapter of Carlifle and the incumbent beiug 
exempted.

Till 1689, it does not appear, that this parifli had any regular refidcnt minihcr.
The dean and chapter, according to the original aim and plan of impropriators, fent 
one of their own body, once a month, from Carlifle, to do all the little duty that 
was then done in the parlfli.
In that year, however, a regular miniBer was appointed; who continued to re- 
fide in this parifh, till 173 ^ when he died, as it uould fecm, merely of old age.
This was the Rev. James Kenneir, who, on the abolition of cpifeopacy in Scotland, 
was driven from his redlory at Annan, and found an afylurn heie.
To him fucceeded Josiaii Relph; of whom our readers will find an ample 
account in our Biocraphia Cumbriensis, hereunto annexed.
f 
Mr.
•f This charming village, which Is generally allowed to be one of the pleafanteft in our county, had the 
honour, on the 3d of December, 1712, to give birth to the Rev. Josiah Relph ; who has emphatically 
been called The Poet of the North.
— His parentage was low, but not mean.
An age or two ago, our 
villages were in general occupied, not by men of large overgrown ellates, or great and wealthy farmers ; 
but by the owners of fmall landed ctlates, from whence they were called fatefnen : a term once ufed by 
one of our countrymen.
In the Houfe of Commons, much to the amufement of the late Earl of Guilford, 
who then prcfided at the helm.
The number of fuch petty landholders is fuppofed to be greatly Jlmiiiiflied 
of late yeans: we believe, how'ever, that they are ilill mure numerous in Cumberland, than in any other 
county.
Such a Jlatefvian was the father of Relph.
On a fmall paternal inheritance, which could not 
exceed, if it even amounted to, thirty pounds a year, with a kind of patriarchal fimpllcity, he brought 
up a family of three fons and a daughter ; one of whom he fet out for a learned profeffion.
Our poet received bis fchool education under our northern Bulby ; the learned and venerable Mr.
Yates of Appleby.
This truly eminent fchoolmafter, like his great prototype of Weftminlter, and his 
cotemporary Mr. Jackfon of St. Bees, fpent more than half a century (a large portion of even the longefl 
life) in the arduous office of Inftrudling youth : and few men have had the reputation of fending 
out into the world io many good fcholars.
At fifteen, Relph went to the univerfity of Glafgow ; where, 
we are told, he gave fome dillinguifhed proofs of a remarkable genius.
At this feat of the mufes, it 
ffiould feem he remained not long : for we find him early engaged in a fmall grammar fchool at this his 
native village.
In due time, he fucceeded to the minlfter’s place ; which is a perpetual curacy, and then 
hardly worth 30I.
a year.
We find no reafon to Induce us believe, that his income ever exceeded 50I.
per annum.
Mr. Relph, in his early years, took up that good cuftom of noting the more memorable occurrences of 
his life, in the way of a diary.
One of thefe his memorandum-books we have been fortunate enough to 
procure: and from it we have been enabled to gather fundry interefting particulars of his private life.
And it appears from them all, that he was a good and an amiable man.
He had a ftep mother ; who feems to have been harffi and unkind to him, and to a beloved filler : all 
which he fubmitted to, and bore, with pious refignatlon.
With her, as perhaps was natural, the father 
feems to have fided againft the fon ; an injury which he felt the more poignantly, from his having 
“ either entirely, or very near, made up to him all the cxpence he liad been at In his education.” — Fiom 
his pupils too, and their parents, he feems fometimes to have met with unkind returns.
His reflexions 
on thefe occafions prefent him to us in a fingularly endearing point of view.
” January aid, 1737.
“ When any of the boys under my care do not make fuch improvement in learning and goodnefs as, from 
“ my endeavours, I might be jullified In expedling: and when alfo they leave the fchool without expreffing 
“ that gratitude, which I think I might have looked for : or when the parents difapprove of my methods, 
“ or difcipline — let me be particularly on my guard not to abate of my care of tliofe ftill left in my charge : 
“ and regarding the cenfures I am expofed to, fo far only as that 1 may amend what, on a partial felf- 
“ examination, I find to be really wrong, let it be my confolation to recolleft, that, if I do my duty in 
“ the ftation of life to which the good providence of God has called me, though I mifs my reward here, 
“ I fhall not finally go unrewarded.” — Lefs fortunate than the Prophet Eliffia, the bard of Sebergham 
found no great 'woman of Shunern, to provide him a little ehafuber on the '•wall: but, in a lonely dell, by a 
TOL.

PARISH OF SEBERGHAM.
Mr. Samuel Relph, the uncle of Jofiah, fucceeded his nephew ; and having lived 
refpcvfled, died lamented in 1768, aged eighty-two years.
He 
murmuring ftrcam, under the canopy of heaven, he had provided himfelf a table and a ftooU and a little 
raifed feat, or altar, of fods.
Hither, in all his little difficulties and diftrefles, in imitation of his Saviour, 
he retired and prayed.
— The feeing fuch a man in fuch a fituation would almoft have realized the beautiful 
ftorv of Parnell’s hermit ; or even of St. John in the wildernefs.
Rifing from his knees, he generally 
committed to paper the meditation on which he had been employed, or the refolves he had then formed.
Gne of thefe, as a fpecimen of the reft, we will here tranferibe.
“ Give me grace, O God, always to have charity for the bad, and civility to all ; whilft yet I refolve 
“ to have intimacies but with few.
May I hate nothing but vice, and love nothing but virtue.
And 
whilft I continue, as I ought, to confidcr the glory of God, and the falvation of my own foul, as the maia 
“ end which I propofe to myfelf in life, teach me to confider prefent fufferlng as an earneft of future enjoy- 
*• ment ; and even ficknefs and forrow as fent In mercy to prepare me for that better ftate, which cannot 
“ now, I truft, be very diftant.” 
On bufmefs and emergencies which he deemed ftill more momentous, he deferted his grot, and withdrew 
into the church.
Toung, during the folemn ftillnefs of midnight, under the beautiful walk of lime-trees 
in the church-yard at Wellwyn, walked, contemplated, and compofed his Night Thoughts.
Relph, lefs 
favoured by climate, walked in the ailes within his church : and there, in that awful folitude, poured out 
his foul in prayer and praife to his Maker.
Poetry has always been the folace of men of genius, under the preflure of “ trouble, foirow, need, fick- 
“ nefs, or any other adverfity.’^ Relph was an early, as well as a conftant, votary of the mufes.
His father’s 
eftate, though fmall, was not without that fort of fccnery, which is peculiarly pleafing to the eye of a 
poet.
It had flowery meadows, filver ftreams, hanging groves, and many commanding views of the cir- 
cumjacent country'.
His favourite walk was to a fountain that poured, in foft meanders, down a gentle 
declivity, till it gained the Caldevv, whofe waters here lave the borders of a beautiful valley.
Here he 
had a filh-pond, a chair, and table, formed from the natural rock ; where, when at leifure from the duties 
of his profeffion, and In the hours not devoted to abftraftlon and pfayer, he was accuftomed to entertain 
a feledf party of chearful friends In that primitive fimplicity, which charafterifes the paftoral ages.
He loved folitude, as equally favourable to piety and poetry.
He loved too to be alone, when employed 
on fubjefts immediately connefted w'lth the line of his duty.
— He meditated on the Infpired writings, and 
thence deduced fources of confolation and inftrurftion for the benefit of his parochial charge, chiefly when 
ihe curfew had tolled the knell of parting day.
To his folitary comtemplations and night thoughts in the church-yard, without any light, or with a 
light only fufficlent to render darknefs viftble, his fundry audiences were indebted forthofe fermons, which 
the editor of his poems refer to, as teftimonies of his piety and induftty.
The awe, excited by the foot- 
fteps of Relph at this unufual hour, Is not yet effaced from the memory of the aged villager.
In his fchool, he was a fti 161 difeiplinarian.
That he fent out of it many good fcholars.
Is weft known : 
but how much of this is to be attributed to his ftrldlnefs, we leave to others to determine.
He himfelf 
was cerraiirly a man of very confiderable attainments in llierature.
This is proved not only by the general 
efteem of many cotemporary men of learning, vvlth whom he lived on terras of friendfliip, but alfo by thofe 
of his tranftations from the daffies, which have been publilhcd.
As a poet, his merit has long been felt and acknowledged.
We do not Indeed prtfume to recommend 
him to tbofe high-loaving critics, who affe6t to be pleafed with nothing but the vivida vis, the energy, 
and majeftic grandeur of poetry.
Relph’s verfes afpire only to the chara6ler of being natural, terfe, and 
cafy : and that chara6fer they certainly merit, in an extraordinary degree.
His Fables may vie with 
Gay’s for finoothnefs of dldflon-; and are fuperior to Gay’s, by having their moral always obvious and 
apt.
But It is on his Paftorals in the Cumberland dialed!
that, if we might prefume to feat ourfelves 
in the chair of criticifm, we would found his pretenfions to poetical fame.
That our opinion Is perfedfly 
right, it might be prefumptuous in us to fuppofe : but we ceitainly have perfuaded ourfelves, that a dialed!
is, if not effential, yet highly advantageous, to paftoral poetry : and that the rich, itrong, Doric dialed!
of this country is, of all dialed!s, the moft proper.
On this ground, Relph’s Paftorals have tranfeendeni 
inerit.
With but a little more of fentimenl in them, and perhaps tendernefs, they would very nearly

He was followed by another native of the parifh, the Rev. Thomas Denton ; of 
whom alfo a further account is fubjoined, under the head of Biography.
Fortunate 
come up to that inimitably beautiful paftoral, The Gentle Shepherd of Allan Ramfay.
In fliort, thefe 
Cumberland eclogues are, in Englilh, what we fuppofe thofe of Theocritus to have been in Greek.
The 
ideas, as well as the language, are perfectly rural ; yet neither the one nor the other arc either vulgar or 
coarfe.
Pope’s Paftoials (and perhaps Gay’s too in an inferior degree) are fo trim and courtly, that the 
language of his rtiepherds and fliepherdeffes is as poliihed, and their ideas as refined, as if all their lives in 
courts had been : whilft Philips’s damfcls and fwains, notwithftanding the uncouth rufticity of their names, 
are fo affefted, as to be quite unnatural.
Relph drew his portraits from real life : and fo faithful were his 
tranferipts, that there was hardly a perfon in the village, who could not point out thofe who had fate for 
his Curjly and his Peggy.
The Amorous Maiden was well known ; and a very few years ago, was ftill 
living.
The charafter of Relph’s mufe was a natural elegant eafe and fimplicity.
He loved Indeed to furvey, 
though at a diftance, the fublimities of Carrock and Skiddanu and Saddleback : but was contented to cull 
a few fimple wild flowers that bloomed fpontaneoufly in fome neglefted dells on the banks of the Caldew.
Had he lived to publifli his own poems, his motto might have been, 
“ Ego, apis matinae 
“ More rnodoque 
“ Grata carpentis thyma per laborem 
“ Plurimum, circa nemus, uvidique 
“ Tiburis ripas, operofa parvus 
“ Carmina fingo.”

In delineating the paflions and cuftoms operative on low life, he is inimitable.
And that critic mull 
be infenfible to the beauties of nature, and propriety of charafter, who does not with pleafure accompany 
our bard, whilft, with a pidturefque accuracy, he diferiminates the peculiarities, and defcribes the undif- 
tlnguiflied and Innocent loves of the Damons and Chloes of the vale of t^ebergham.
Relph’s afliduity in the difeharge of his minifterlal duties appeared In the effe(ifs It produced.
The 
inhabitants of his parlfti had, till then, been rude and unpolilhed: ignorant and Illiberal ; abjectly fuper- 
ftitious in the belief of exploded ftories of witches, ghofts, and apparitions, with but little morality, and 
lefs religion.
They confidered the fabbath as grateful, only for the relaxation It afforded them from their 
labours ; as a day of recreation, rather than a day devoted to religious exercifes : of courfe, it was gene- 
rally fpent in tumultuous meetings at ale-houfes, or in the rude diverfions of foot-ball.
— Kcnneir^ or 
Kinnear, a Scotchman, and epifcopalian, who, in the fury of Prefoyterian reformation, had been driven 
from his reftory at Annan, and received at Sebergham, was Relph’s predeceflbr in the church ; and, 
being really a religious man, he fet himfelf, with great earneifnefs, to reform them ; but his fuccefs bore 
no proportion to his zeal.
He was an aujlere man, and his religion gloomy and unfocial : his converfa- 
tlon diftant and referred ; and his manners ungracious.
Attacking, and roundly condemning) all amufe-

The happinefs of effecting a reformation was refei ved for the Rev. Josiah Relph, a native of the 
parifh ; a man, confidering his years, of extenfive learning, of great natural abilities, yet modeft and 
unafpiring ; facial and cheaiful in his dlfpofition, amiable in his manners, and warm in the caufe of virtue 
and religion.
To him in a great meafure muft be attributed that elegance of converfitlon, ofteem for 
learning, and reverence for religion, which travellers even of the piefent day obferve in a people, whofe 
anceftors were tutored by Mr. Ktlph.

Whatever be our opinion of the merit of Relph’s Paftorals, they have been fo often reprinted, that wc 
dare net rifque the palling the public tafte by a repetition of them.
PoffciTcd of the manuferipts, from 
which his editor felecfed the poems already in print, we poffefs many that vvould be new to the public ; 
but, though our gleanings are copious, they are not rich.
We have none, but fuch as Mr. Denton did 
not think proper to publifh.
Among thefe is a free, yet faithful, tranflatlon of many of the epigrams of 
Martial ; which have great merit ; and fome compofitlons in Latin, both in vetfe and profe.
From thefe 
laft we tranfenbe the four following lines, which were to have been inferibed on a dial, eredbed in the mill- 
race that runs through Mr. Denton’s garden, at Green-Foot : 
“ Perpetuo properat lapfu refonabilis unda ; 
“ Perpetuo paffii ferpit et umbra tacens : 
“ Mox redit umbra tacens, et mox refonabilis unda, 
“ Aft hominum vita, heu I non reditura volat.”

Ode XXIIL 
* If fuppliani hands to heav’n you ralfe 
‘ When firft the moon emits her rays, 
‘ And to the lares humbly fue 
‘ With frankincenfe and wine that’s new ; 
‘ No noxious wind fliall nip your vine, 
‘ Your corn with blights Taall never pine ; 
‘ And fafe your little ones fhall play, 
‘ Nor fear the force of Autumn’s ray.
‘ Let pontiffs tln„e their knives with red 
‘ in the proud necks of viclims fed, 
“ Where Algidon’s white grove appears, 
“ Or where his head Albanus rears.
“ But, Phidile, be’t none of yours 
“ To bribe with gifts the heav’nly pow’rs : 
“ Your gods, with myrtles grac’d, adore 
“ In Innocence, and heed no more.
“ If a pure hand the altar feize, 
“ When angry Heaven you’d appeafe ; 
“ A little bread and falt’s as good, 
“ As heaps of fat and ftreams of blood.” 
In his ftature, Relph was tall, and of a thin habit ; had a commanding afpeft, on which a certain dig- 
nity was imprinted : which, unlike that founded on falfe principles, arole from the confeioufnefs of great 
abilities exerted in a good caufe, and from thofe motives of piety and virtue, which aftuated him through 
life.
— His death happening at a comparatively early period, his afcetic manner of living with regard to 
diet, has been, perhaps too haftily, blamed for accelerating it.
His conftitutlon was naturally weak, and 
with a tendency to confumptlon : this confidered, the regimen he prefcrlbed to hlmfclf was perhaps more 
friendly to It, than a more liberal Indulgence.
Conti ary to the entreaties of his friends, he continued his fchool, when his conftitutlon was vlfibly 
giving way to that diferder, which at length laid him in his grave.
A few days before his death, he 
fent for all his pupils, one by one, into his chamber, to be witneffes of his dying moments.
A more 
affecting interview it is not poftihle to conceive.
One of his pupils, ftlll living, acknowledges, he never 
thinks of it but with awe : It reminds him, he fays,,of the laft judgment.
The dying faint was perfeftly 
compofed, colledled, and ferene.
His valedictory admonitions were not long, but they were earnetl and 
pathetic.
He addrelTed each of them In terms fomewhat different, adapted to their different tempers and 
circumftances : but in one charge he was uniform : lead a good life, that your death may be eafy, and 
you everlaftingly happy.
To fo melancholy a laft farewel, we may juftly apply the lines which Tickell 
wrote on a firailar occafion ; 
“ He taught us how to live ; and," oh !
too high 
“ The price of knowledge, taught us how to die.” 
This excellent man clofed his Ihort life on the 26th day of June, 1 743, in the thlrty-fecond year of his 
age.
He died unmarried, of an hedlic complaint, at Church-Town, the place of his nativity ; and was buried 
in the family burying-ground in Sebergham church-yard.

This Epitaph was, not long fince, printed in The Cumberland Pacquet, with the tranflatlon ; and two 
additional lines annexed to the Epitaph, informing the readers by whom the ftone was erefled — This 
addition was made by the prefent refpedtable curate of Sebergham, no doubt with the beft intentions, but 
certainly without either the privity, or the approbation, of the perfon, whofe name is there ufed ; who 
was contented and defirous, on this occafion at leaft, to be known only, as he himfelf expreftes it, in the 
foregoing life, “ as an admirer of poetry, and lover of virtue.” The account given of this Epitaph in 
the newfpaper, moreover, was fo drawn up, as to imply, if not aftert, that the whole of it was written by 
the curate of Sebergham.
There certainly is nothing in the infcription, which any man can value himfelf 
for having written : it is fair, however, and proper, that the world fliould be truly informed, that this 
brief account of Relph, the eredlion of a monument to his memory, and this infcription, are all from one 
and the fame perfon.
Here, in 1724, was born the Rev. Thomas Denton, of an ancient and worthy family in this 
county, of that refpeftable, though now almoft obfolete, clafs of citizens, called the yeomanry.
He was 
one of five Tons ; another of whom entered into orders ; another had a place in the cuftorns ; another 
was, for many years, a well-known and univerfally beloved fecretary to the Bifnop of Carlifie : the eldeft 
lived and died on the paternal eftate at Green-Foot, now in the poffeftion of his fon, the prefent Vicar of 
Brcmfield.
Mr. Thomas Denton had his fchool education under Mr. Jofiah Relph ; of whofe poems he gave an 
handfome edition, pubhftied by fubfeription.
From fchool, he went to Queen’s college, in Oxford, moft 
probably on the foundation ; and appears to have taken his Mafter’s degiec, June 16th, 1752 ; his elder 
brother, John, having graduated two years before.
On leaving college, he became curate to the late 
Rev. Dr.
Graham, of Netheiby, at Aithuret and Kirkandrews ; where he wrote, and printed, only to 
be given away, a local poem, entitled Garijion ; of which we have not been able to procure a copy.
At 
this place he did not remain long.

fatisfadion of the people, conftantly refides ; being alfo the fchoolmafter of the 
village, and a man of very refpedable abilities.
To him (we acknowlenge) wc are 
indebted 
on which he refided.
But, in 1753, finding it neceflary for him to attend to his great interells in the 
north, he came down and fettled at Netherby ; appointing Mr. Denton his curate at Afhted.
Here he 
naturally became acquainted wdth the owner of the Netherby eftate, Lady Widdrington ; to whom, as (he 
was aged and infirm, he adled as chaplain.
And he fo effedlually recommended himfelfi hy the mildnefs 
and courtefy of his manners, as w'ell as by his genius and learning, that (he very foon not only prevailed 
on her relation, Mr. Graham, to refign the living of Afhted in Mr. Denton’s favour, but alfo on the 
patron to prefent Mr. Denton to It. He foon after married Mrs. Cluffe, a native of Yorkfhire, the con- 
fidential and favourite fervant, or rather companion, of Lady Widdrington ; to whom, dying foon after, 
viz.
in 1777, handfome legacy, and an annuity.
Mr. Denton publifhed two well-written and well-received poems.
The former of thefe, entitled 
“ Immortality, or the Confolation of Human Life, a Monody f firft printed as a fingle poem in 4to, was 
afterwards reprinted in Dodfley’s Colleftion ; in the fifth volume of which elegant colleftion it may now 
be found- The other is called “ The Houfe of Superftition, a Vifonf and is prefixed to Mr. Gilpin’s 
Life of WIcklifF.
— Faftidlous criticifm might poffibly fay of Mr. Denton’s poetry, that It is correct even to 
coldnefs : but It certainly is terfe and claffical ; and bears undoubted marks of an highly cultivated genius.
Both his pieces are written In the manner of Spenfer t and it may fairly be faid, that Mr. Denton is not 
the leaft fuccefsful of the numerous Immitators of Spenfer.
We fubjoin a (lanza from each of his odes.
FROM THE MONODY.
Ye fmiling glories of the youthful year, 
“ That ope your fragant bofoms to the day, 
“ That clad In all the pride of fpring appear, 
“ And fteep’d in dew your filken wings difplay : 
“ In Nature’s richeft robes though thus bedight, 
“ Though her foft pencil trace your various dye, 
“ Though lures your rofeate hue the charmed fight, 
“ Though odours fweet your neft’ious breath fupply, 
“ Soon on your leaves Time’s cank’rous tooth (liall prey, 
“ Your dulcet dews exhale, your beauteous blcom decay.” 
The following defcriptlon of the palace or houfe of Superstition is highly poetical, as well as 
accurate and juft ; — 
“ In flocks unnumber’d, like a pitchy cloud, 
“ Birds of ill omen round the fabric fly, 
“ Here build their nefts, and nurfe their callow brood, 
“ And fcare the timorous foul with boding cry.
“ Here Superstition holds her dreary reign, 
“ And her lip-labour’d orifons (he plies 
” In tongue unknown, when morn bedews the plain, 
“ Or evening flcirts with gold the weftern (Icics ; 
T.o the dumb flock (lie bends, or fculptur’d wall, 
“ And many a crofs (he makes, and many a bead lets fall.” 
It gives us no fmall fatisfaftion, to have it in our power to add fo refpedlable a name as Mr. Denton’s, 
to the lift of our fellow -labourers in the fields of biography.
He compiled the fupplemental volume to 
the laft edition of the Biographical Didflonary ; of which It Is no ordinary praife to fay, that, in point 
of accuracy and fidelity, it is not inferior to any of the others : but, we may add, that, as the materials 
appear to have been more difperfed and fcarce, his compilation (hews not only a great compafs of reading, 
but good judgment in felefting.
Early in life alfo, he reformed and publidred a very ufeful maniiel of devotions, entitled “ Religiouf 
« Retirement for One Day in every Month." The original, we believe, was by that pious, pleafing, and

He was a youth endow^ed with an excellent underftanding, the mofl: virtuous

not feen a book of the kind more pertinent to that purpofe.
Mr. Denton was.
In his perfon (at leaft In the later periods of his life) corpulent and unwieldy ; of 
unalTuming modeft manners ; ferene and placid, rather than chearful ; and a facetious man, rather than a 
man of humour.

He left three fons,

And it may be mentioned much to his credit, as well as to the credit of his patron, 
lhat having had it In his power, as is too often the lot of clergymen, to make but a flender provifion for

Belides the above manor, the dean and chapter of Carlifle have alfo an inde- 
pendent manor here (firfl: obtained, as is fuppofed, from the anchoret De JVaJie- 
dale) which is likewife called the manor of Sebergham.
This confiffs of about 
fixteen cuffomary tenants, five leafeholders, and one freeholder.
Thefe cuffomary 
tenants alfo are now all freeholders, by their fliares of the faid commons ; for 
which they pay a quit-rent of 4I.

to the faid dean and chapter.
And to 
prevent for the future all interference of manerial rights or jurifdivfiions, it is agreed 
and declared by the acd: of parliament for dividing and incloling the faid common, 
that the manor of the fixid dean and chapter fliall extend only to the leafehold and 
cuftomary eflates held under them, and to the feveral parcels of the faid common or 
wafte-ground allotted to the faid leafehold and cCiftomary eflates’, by virtue of 
the faid aifl.
To thefe may yet be added the mefne manor of Warnel-Hall : a fmall manor at 
Hart-Rigg, the property of Thomas Benfon, Efq. of Carlifle ; and another that 
is held by the redor of Caldbeck.
This is a trad of woody ground, lying at the 
fouthern extremity of the parifli, and called the Parfon's Park.
It was inclofed 
by one of the earlieft redors of Caldbeck; who gave a part of it to the Abbey 
Holme.
There are, properly fpcaking, but two villages in the parifh ; viz.
Welton and 
Sebergham; but there are two or three hamlets, fuch as Ncwlands, Warnel, and 
Hart-Rigg.
In general, the buildings are pretty equally fcattered around the 
parilh, in a manner particularly convenient ; the land of each ellate, lying more 
compad than is ufually met with elfewhere, and the buildings placed fo as to fuit 
the occupation of the eflates to which they refpedivciy belong.
The village of 
Sebergham adjoins the church : Welton is at the northern extremity of the parifh, 
and almoft contiguous to Dalfton.
There is no market; but there are two con- 
ftablewicks, or quarters, which go by the name of Sebergham High Bound and 
Sebergham Low Bound.
The turnpike road from Penrith to Wigton and Cockermouth runs through the 
middle of this panfn : and another from Kefwick to Carlifle, crofTing the former at 
a place called Goofe-Green.
Both thefe roads, befides the ufual refort of travellers, 
are generally crowded with coal and lime-carts, from the inexhaullible flores on 
Warncl-Fell.
Population, Blc.
— When Burn and Nicolfon publifhed their hiflory of this 
parifn, the population was eflimated at i r i families, all of them of the church of 
England, fave one Quaker.* In 1791, an adual enumeration was made, on pur- 
pofe for this hiflory.
The houfes, or families, w ere then 1 40 ; and the number of 
living fouls, 736 ; which is about 54- to a family.

J- As an inftance of longevity, the life of Duncan Robinson, who is now verging on his hundredth 
year, may be worthy of notice.
He is a native of the Highlands of Scotland, and entered into the aimy at 
a very early period of life, having made his firft campaign under the banners of the viftorlous Marlborough.
He fought againft the rebels in 1715 and 1 745, and was in the moft decifive aeftions that took place in 
Flanders during the wars with France in the reign of George the Second.
At the peace of 1763, this 
venerable warrior retired, with his mufquet, his belt, and his fword, to Sebergham, where he has lived to 
the prefent time, in a little cottage, as a good citizen, without any other reward from his country, befides 
a fmall penfion of feven pounds a year.
— To thofe who are induced from curlofity to vifit him, he gives a 
faithful narration of the various campaigns in which he ferved, with the blunt fimplicity of a foldicr, and 
aot without animation, — for wars, battles, and fieges, are “ mufic to his foul.” 
In the frame of his body, he Is brawny and athletic ; his looks are bold and expreffive, and hts whole 
deportment fupports an air of martial dignity, which neither age, infirmity, nor poverty, has been able 
to deprefs.
— He is.
humane, benevolent, and religious, — affording an inftance of the intimate connedtion 
of thefe qualities with bravery and true heroifm.

thofe excepted vvdio are employed in coal and lime-pits.
This fliews, how much 
it is the fafliion in this parifli (as, indeed, it is in the county in general) to culti- 
vate the land, not merely by hirelings, but by the honed: and hearty laboitr of the 
immediate occupant and his children.
And as there is reafon to believe, that this 
cuftom prevails much more in the northern than it does in the fouthern counties, 
of the kingdom, it is perhaps one of the chief reafons for lands letting in the north, 
in general, not much lower than they are let in the fouth.
The old inclofurcs in this parifh have been edimated at about 4000 acres; and 
thofe taken in from the wade, or common, w'ere 2896 acres.
So that, taking the 
whole population at 736, and allowing the one half of that number to be either 
pad labour, or not yet arrived at an age capable of labour, it appears, that nearly 
7000 acres of land (the greated part of which is in tillage, in its turn) are worked 
by a very few more than 300 perfons ; this leaves more than ten acres to be cul- 
tivated by one perfon.
How proper this propodtion is, is left to others to 
determine : the lands are, in general, well cultivated ; and the occupiers of 
them, being frugal as well as indudrious, are, in general, thriving, though perhaps 
but feldom rich.
Natural Productions, Agriculture,* &c, — On Warnel-Fell, there is a 
condderable colliery, carried on with much fpirit and fuccefs under the Duke 
of Norfolk, who holds it by a long leafe from the Duke of Portland.
By. the 
report of the very intelligent manager of this colliery, Mf. Jofeph Dobfon, there 
is fufficient evidence in the works thcmfelves, to prove, that coals have been 
dug here three hundred years ago; which was almod as foon as coals were gene- 
rally made ufeof in the kingdom for fuel.
Coal of an extraordinary good quality 
is faid alfo to abound every where on the edate of Warnel Denton : but, owing to 
fome untow'ard circumdances, thefe mines have not been worked thefe forty years.
Warnel-Fell is alfo a kind of .
rich dorehoufe to all this didridl of country ; con- 
taining inexhaudable quarries of limedone.
— In the above-named edate of Warnel 
Denton, there is a petrifying fpring of condderable potency; the mofs around it 
being all hardened into the conddency of done.
And, in a place, very properly 
called the Iron-Gill, beneath Warnel-Fell, there is a chalybeate fpring ; which, 
though hitherto but little referred to, there can be no doubt, pofleffes all the virtues 
ufually found in water fo impregnated with deel.
Few dreams in any country 
can furnidi dner dtuations for all fuch machinery as is carried on by water than 
Caldew; particularly admirable for the picdurefque feenery furnifhed by its woody 
banks.
There is no dream, in which a brother angler (as the writer of this account 
is proud to call himfelf after honed Izaak fValton) can dnd more delight; for, 
though its trouts are not perhaps reckoned quite fo delicately flavoured, as fome 
others in fome of the neighbouring fmaller di earns, which go by the name of Burn

* A few years ago, the late Mr. John Sanderson, of Church Town, a man well acquainted with 
both the theory aud praftice of agriculture, made an experiment on a field of wheat-fallow by a drill- 
plough, coiiftruded on the principles laid down by Mr. Tull ; but it did not anfwer his expediations, 
the crop being very thin on the ground, though the ears w’ete heavy and well-fed, and the grain was fair, 
and yielded much flour.

PARISH OF SEBERGHAM.
As there is no inanufaclure of confiderable extent in the parifh (one bleach- 
field near Sebergham Bridge excepted, which is carried on with great ability and 
fuccefs by Mr. Robfon Clarke, a native of the parifh) its inhabitants in general are 
employed folely in agriculture.
And, as neither their fkill nor their indufiry are 
inferior to that of the inhabitants of other diflrids, fo neither is their fuccefs lefs.
Nearly an half of their cultivated land is improved moor, or common; and its foil 
and produce do not differ materially from thofe of Caflle-Sovverby ; fave only, that 
more wheat and lefs barley is raifed here, and alfo that the crops, here arc in gene- 
ral fomevvhat earlier and heavier.
The north-weft part of the late common is 
indeed particularly poor; and it would feem, that moft of this improved common 
is pretty nearly in the fame ftate as that of Caftle-Sowcrby, and for the fame caufe.
If, befides the unavoidable objedfion, that much of this lately improved land has 
not yet been brought into perfeeft good tilth, there be any other natural dlfad- 
vantage to be regretted, it is, that the foil is cold, and there is afeantinefs of natural 
meadow.
The particular difadvantages it feems to labour under from bad 
management are thefe : tempted by the exuberance of the crops, w'hich virgin 
foil almoft always yields, when firft cultivated, the farmers plough their new 
inclofures too long; ten or a dozen crops of corn having fometimes been reaped in 
fucceffion, with little or no melioration ; and though, at length, they have dif- 
covered their error, even yet they do not lay down their lands in grafs feeds fo 
generally as they ought.
According to the general cuftom of the county, the 
people here are but beginning to cultivate turnips; whilft, like moft of their 
neighbours, they have long raifed, and ftill do raife, vaft quantities of potatoes, 
which, it may not perhaps be deemed impertinent to obferve, are of a quality 
very fuperior to potatoes raifed in more fouthern counties, and alfo a much more 
common article of food.
One commendable improvement has lately been adopted 
here, which no doubt will foon become more general.
Inftead of lying the lime 
on their lands, raw as it may be called, as ufed to be the praeftice, it is now formed 
into a compoft, by mixing it with dung, earth, rubbifti, &c.
and thus lying it up 
in heaps, for a year or fo, till its crudities are removed, when it is fpread on the 
land with almoft certain and immediate great advantage.

The Editors have been favoured with the following valuable information fince the firft volume was publlfhed.
Gitjlom of the Manor of CajlU Sonverby .
— Copyhold lands within this manor do not defeend to the heir male (according 
fo the technical import of the expreffion.) The cuftom here refpedtiag defeents being agreeable to the common law uf 
the land, and fo females inherit as coparceners, which is imufua!
in a copyhold or cultoniary manor ; the general cuftom 
tn this county beingj in the cafe of females, for the eldeft to take the whole.
There is a god’s-penny (or filvcr-penny) on every admittance, as well upon defeent as alienation ; and, in the latter 
cafe, a fine of fame account as the annual lord’s rent, which is ufually called a Angle penny fine, and fo on a mortgage 
but upon defeents nothing more than a god’s-penny, and the like upojt a furrender to the ufe of one’s will.
This, we 
prefume, is the cuftom throughout the whole foreft of Inglewood.
The wife of a.
copyholder cannot be diverted of her contingent right of dower without her confent : for it is the general 
law of copyholds, that the widow is only dowahle of fiich eftates as her bufband died feized of, and was a perfedf copyholder 
at the time of his death ; and, therefore, if the hufband ftiould either fell or mortgage the copyholds in his life time, or 
even furrender them to the ufe of his will, any of thefe adls will debar the w'ife of dower.
This, we prefume, is not 
inconfiftent with the cuftom of the manor ot Sowerby, nntwithftanding the generally received opinion in the neighbour* 
hood to the contrary*.
It is prefumed, a few inftances of the wife's joining her hulband in the furrender of hii eftate would 
not tend to overturn the general rule or law of copyholds juft fpoken of ; and whether that continuance alone, although 
having been the general pradtice for half a century part, would of itfclf eftablifh a cuftom contrary to fucb general law,,

Ive, Rand the ruins of a calllc, by fome called 
HIGHHEAD,

and “ faid to be a caRle of the Richmonds.” It is built on the brink of a rocky 
precipice; the court-yard has no pavement, but the mere furface of the rock hewed 
down and made even.
It was a dependent manor of the barony of Dalflon, and 
w as foraconfiderabletime the pofleffion of the Harcla family.
In ancient records, f 
it is called Vela de Htvehead; a name apparently derived from its fituation.
There 
are no remains of ftrength, or grandeur, but a gateway tower, with an exploratory 
turret at one corner, and the curtain wall, with the fhattered remains of a tower 
above the rivulet.
John de Harcla was feized thereof in the time of King Edvv.

brother, Andrew Earl of Carlifle; upon whofe attainder, the caflle being thea 
occupied by the earl’s brotlier, John, was defected ; he immediately flying, with Sir 
William Blount, and others his accomplices, toScotland.
Soon after this forfeiture, 
the manor was granted by the crown to Ranulph de Dacre, and was in his pofleflion

The chapel was ne\er made parochial ; the ceremoniee of burial and chrlftning are retained at the 
mother church.
The chapelry, including the extraparochial hamlets of MIddlefceugh and Braithwaite, Is about four 
miles in length from north to fouth, and about two miles broad : the perpetual cuiacy has always been 
given by fixteen truftees chofen from the different hamlets ; it has received Qireen Anne’s bounty twice, 
ifvhich was laid out in lands near Kefwlck and Hefleet-New-Market ; there is alfo a fmall ftipend paid 
yearly from the caftle ; the whole Income 30I.
a year.
The chapel has more the appearance of a tithe- 
barn than a place of worfhip, being a long narrow birilding, without celling or ornament.
It has always 
been cuftomary, when the curacy is given, to make the curate give bond in the penalty of lool.

The Ive, or Ive beck, empties itfelf into Raugh beck, a little way from the

remains of a large encampment.
In a letter from George Smith, Efq. to the late 
Roger Gale, and which is preferved among his manuferipts, this place is thus 
noted — “ In the map, fig.
A. Near the meridian of Carlifle, is a large Roman fort, 
“ of about feven acres, with an inner rampart, ditch, and double agger, and the 
“ prastorium very vifible, though never taken notice of.

Near it, is an 
“ exploratory fort, called Sloneraife by the natives, on the top of the hill above it: 
“ bur, as never any inferiptions were found there, 1 take them to be of the high 
" empire ; probably fome bf Agricola’s, before the wall was built.
Nor could I 
find any Roman road about,§ though the place has ever been out of tillage for

“ About two miles call of Rofe Caftle is Broadfield, an uncultivated common on Englewood forefl.— -« 
Here are three ancient works, within half a mile of each other, forming a triangle, faid to be Roman 
camps.
Two of them undoubtedly appear to be fuch ; but the third I Ihall prove to have been an inclofed 
place, fet apart for the foie purpofe of fepulture.
“ (A) is a plan of the largeft of thefe camps, called Cajlle-Steeds.
It is fituated on an eminence,,

ROMAN CAMP.
" feveral miles near it ; yet there are many buildings within and upon the ram- 
parts in ruins: hand-mills or querns have been found there.” — This fituarion 
feems to confirm that it was a Roman work, as it lies upon an angle of land, 
having Dalfton beck to the fouth, and Raugh beck to the weft ward.
There are 
few' Roman camps in England with fo many works ; but fome of thofe on this 
ftation may liave been additions made by their fucceflbrs: and indeed this feems 
probable, as the interior banking has moft the appearance of the remains of the 
Roman rampier.
The quantity of ground is pretty well defcribed by Mr. Smith.
The remains of buildings are confufed, and totally uncertain.!
The place called 
Stone- 
of a mile of the little hamlet of Stocklewath, where a brook divides the parllhes of Caftle Sovverby and 
Dalfton.
“ The confttuflion of this camp is Angular : it is inclofed with a double ditch and vallum; in the 
centre are little banks of earth and undrefled ftones.
See their pofitions marked [b').
The outward 
vallum on the weft fide is 50 yards from the inward vallum; on the other fide, the diftance is only 35 
yards.
There is fomething very particular in the entrance ; it begins at fome diftance from the outward 
vallum, and continues to the centre of the camp ; on each fide Is a little vallum of earth, as defcribed In 
the plan.
On the inner vallum was a ftone about two feet above the ground, as reprefented at(<?).
In 
digging round this ftone, two more appeared ereft, as at(i).
On removing thefe, aflies were found under 
the large one, but no urn or burnt bones were to be feen.
Thefe ftones evidently appear to have been 
placed there, as the vallum muft have been partly formed when the ftones were put up, they being a con- 
fiderable height above the level ground.
(B) Is a plan of the other camp called White-Jiunes ; it has 
only a Angle ditch and vallufrt, part of which on the fouth fide has been deftroyed ” 
•f Mr. Rooke at the fame time communicated the following dcfcn’ptions — “ About half a mile N.
W. 
from this camp Is a fquare piece of ground, which has been inclofed with a little valltmt of earth, erione- 
oufly called Stoneraife camp (C).
Two of the fides arc nowperfeft, the length of each 67 yards ; within 
this, there appears to have been another fmall inclofure, 34 yards by 22 ; from whence, I have been told, 
fome hundred loads of ftones have been taken for tlie repairs of walls, &c.
; and, from the quantity that is 
left, people conclude that this muft have been a Roman ftation, and that the ftones are the remains of walls 
of the houfes ; but it will appear, upon a clofe examination, that the bank of loofe ftones marked (z?) are the 
remains of four earns ; their circular fliapes are vlfible, but almoft deftroyed, by the labourers having 
fcattered about the fmall ftones In fearch of the larger ones, which were found to be of more ufe.
Near 
to thefe are two more defaced earns ; two appear at {b ') ; and three more, very dlftindl ones, at (c) ; the 
circular hole marked {^d), which I opened, had no appearance of having been a earn ; nor was there any 
thing diftinguifhable, except pai't of a flat ftone, which appeared above the furface.
Being willing 
to examine the fhape of this ftone, I employed three men to clear away the earth, which, when removed, 
(with many large ftones that had been thrown in) It plainly appeared to have been ftiaped, and placed on 
a pavement as in the drawing (e).
— Near the narrow end of this ftone, was another placed ereft, near 
which lay part of a handmill, (f)- This, when perfedl, muft have been of the fame fixe and ftiape as that 
found among fome druidical circles at Dutwoad, near Hurtlefnoor, Derbyfhlre.* 'I'he turning over the 
great ftone, to examine the pavement, required the efforts of three men Its weight is fitppofed to be 
about three ton.^ When removed, a thin coat of baked earth entirely covered the fpace on which it lay.
On this was found a tooth, final!
bits of burnt ftones, and afhes.
The floor was laid upon a body of clay 
three inches thick, (e).

“ I muft here beg leave to obferve, that as earns and tumuli of earth and ftones were fepulchres of the 
Britons as well as of the Romans, it appears to me doubtful to which of the two this extraordinary fepulchi'e

Sloneraife doth not appear to be a cotemporary fortification, but rather the work 
of the ancient Britons : the vallum being conjpofed of loofc ftones, without any

Hand-mills were ufed by the Britons and Romans.
Stomraifs, the name 
given to thefe earns, favours the fuppofition of their being Britlfli.
There Is on the road to Kendal a 
heap of ftones called Dunmal Raife.
— Should the fepulchre I have been treating of be thought to be 
Brltlfti, it, moft probably, was the burying-plaee of fomc confiderable perfon, if we may judge from the 
conftruftion of the ftone floor, pavement, &c.
— On the other hand, we know that the Romans ware, for 
a confiderable time, in every patf of Cumberland ; and that it was ufual for them to have their burying- 
places at fome diftance from their ftations.
We are likewife informed, that the Romans had a punifliineirt, 
which feems to have been proper for incendiaries, and that was wrapping up the criminal in a fort of coat 
daubed over with pitch, and then fetting it on fire.* In this cafe, it is to be fuppofed, that no regard 
would be paid to their afhes, by putting them in urns ; but, fhould the malefaftor happen to be a man of 
rank, it is not improbable but that his friends might place a ftone over his afhes, which, when covered 
with a little earth, w'ithout the dlftltiguifliable tumulus, his fepulchre would not be eafily difeovered.” 
Again, in vol.
X» of the fame repofitory, Mr. Rooke gives the following account— “ In my account 
of thofe ancient inclofed works In En glewood foreft, in Cumberland, which I had the honour to lay- 
before the Society laft year, it appeared doubtful whether they were of Britifh or Roman origin.
The 
foUow'Ing narrative of a difeovery I made laft September on the fame foreft, and not above a mile from 
one of thofe works called Cajlle-Steads, plainly evinces, that they were originally thrown up by the ancient 
Britons.
“ At the S.
W. end of Broadfield, on Englewood foreft, and near High-head Caftle, is a field, which 
has been inclofed about fixty years.
Towards the middle, the earth has been thrown up in a circular 
form, with a floping bank of 1 2 feet.
The diameter of the top, which has a flat and level furface, is 63 
feet.
Here there appeared to have been a circle of ere£I ftones.
The holes from whence they have 
been taken are very dllllngulfhable, and feveral people in the neighbourhood affured me that many large 
ftones have, from time to time, been blafted and carried from this place.
(A) “ Towards the centre, and a little out of the circular line, were fix large ftones placed two and 
two, N® I was 5 feet broad and 4 feet high ; N'* 2, 4 feet In breadth, and 3 feet high ; N° 3, 4 feet and 
a half in breadth, and 3 feet high.
They evidently appeared from their flrape to have been much higher, 
and the prefent tenant told me that he remembers having feen large pieces broken from their tops.
— 
Being of opinion, that this elevated circle had been a Druid temple, I could not help thinking that thofe 
ftones, placed two and two, were put there for fome myfterious purpofe, either as rock Idols, or fepulchral 
monuments of the Druids.
With this idea, 1 ordered two men to clear aw'ay the ground under N'’ i 
and the ftone adjoining.
Here I perceived that great pains had been taken to fix thefe ftones firm irx 
the ground, by placing large ftones clofe round their bafes to the depth of 3 feet and a half.
This, I 
think, favours the fuppofition of their having been a confiderable height above the ground, which would 
naturally require their being firmly fecured in the earth.
The fmalleft of them, at prefent, cannot be 
lefs than five or fix ton weight.
“ in removing the earth and ftones in front of N® i, I obferved, that, as the workmen advanced to- 
wards the centre of the circle, the foil varied to a lighter kind of earth, and free from ftones.
They 
followed this ftratum, and frequently turned up afhes.
At length I difeovered a fmall ftone cheft, the 
ftones of which had been ffiaped and dreffed, and fitted clofe at the fides without cement.
ITiis was 
filled with light fandy earth, and at the bottom were pieces of a Ikull and fmall bits of bones, which 
mouldered away on being touched ; under the fltull, was found a lump (about as big as a man’s fift) of 
concreted metallic particles refembling gold, but whether it Is a compofition of art or nature, feems to 
me doubtful.
I have therefore fent up a piece for the infpectlon of the Society.
“ The ftone of which the cheft was made Is a kind of freSftone common m that part of Cumberland, 
“ In digging under the ftones marked (2) in the plan, they appeared to have been as firmly fixed in 
tire ground as thofe above mentioned.
At about fix feet from tliefe towards the centre, I difeovered

cuftom, and indeed would have rendered it ufclefs, Mr. Camden, fpeakin^ of 
Rofe Caflle, and not having difeovered the above-deferibed ftation, fays — “ This 
^' feems to have been the old Congavata, where the fccond cohort of the Lergi 
“ were 
another chell a little bigger than the fonr.er, the ends equally diverging.
In the bottom was part of a- 
fkull with the upper jaw, the teeth remarkably even.
'I’hey were much decayed and mouldered away on 
being pTclTed. Near the head was found a piece of a flcull, which I at firii thought had been part of 
another head, but as no bones lay near it, I am inclined to think it was part of tire other lleull.
A piece 
of the fame compolitlon, as the above mentioned, only larger, was found under the head.
This cheft was 
covered with a flat (tone, and tw’o large cobble Itones were placed on the top, for the purpofe, I fliould 
fuppofe, of keeping it clofe down.
“ Tire fides of this cheft were a dark-eoloured kind of flate, fliaped and drefted, and what is very re- 
markable, none of the fort is to be found nearer than Grifdale fell, between eighteen and nineteen miles 
from this fpot, and from whence, it is imagined, thele ftones were brought.
Proceeding in like manner, 
from the ftones marked ( 5) in the plan, I found a third cheft, filled with light earth, the fides of which 
were of the common treeftone, and drefted.
Pieces of a Ikull, a few teeth, and fome bones which were 
very brittle, lay at tlie bottom.
There were likewife fome fmall bits of the above mentioned compofition.
Tills cheft was alfo covered with a flat ftone, and two large cobble ftones were upon it.
“ At about 165 yards S.
from the Druid temple, is a laige ftone 23 feet 9 inches in circumference, 
and fuppofed to be near ten ton weight.
On examining the bottom, I perceived it had been floped off 
to a point, from which I imagined it had formerly been a rocking ftone, nor was I deceived in my con- 
jeclure, for on clearing away only part of the ftones and rubbifli from under it, one man fet it in motion 
with the iron crow he was working with, and if eafily moved on its centre.
This appeared more 
extraordinary, as I had been informed by the tenant that he had, not many years ago, blafted off a great 
piece from the top, which it was natural to fuppofe, might have deftroyed the equilibrium (B).
“ Several large ftones had been placed on each fide of the rocking ftone.
Parts of four now remain, 
and I was told that others have been taken up for the conveniency of ploughing ; from whence, I think, 
it is probable, thst there has been an avenue of ereft ftones leading to this lacred rock.
See the plan oF 
the remaining ftones at C, where N° i is the rocking ftone.
“ The placing thefe fmall cliefts fix feet under ground, and in the middle of a Druid temple, is very 
fingular.
It is evident that the bodies could not be inhumed within fo Imall a fp.ace ; it is therefore 
probable, that they were firft burnt, which was a cuftom among the ancients, of very remote antiquity, 
and the bones afterwards depofited in the chefts.
I nuift here obferve, that thefe tombs differ from the 
ftone chefts called Kijivaent found in large barrows, which were made with two large unhewn ftones on 
each fide, and one at each end, forming vaults near feven feet long, and where the bodies were laid at full 
length, with their weapons by their fides.
“ As neither arms nor any kind of ornaments were found in thefe little chefts, I think it is not im- 
probable, but that they were the fepiilchre.s of the principal Druids of that dillritt, who alone would be 
indulged in having their bones depofited witliin tire lacred circle.
“ .Amulets, as prefervatives againft difeafes, witchcraft, and other nnforefeen accidents, were highly 
efteemed by the ancient Britons ; and after death, were depofited in thsir fepulchres, or placed upon their 
afhes in the urns as guardians of the manes.
One thus placed I found in a barrow among the druidical 
remains in Stanton- Moor.
Hence, I think, we may venture to conclude, that the above-mentioned 
himps of metallic particles, were depofited In the chefts as amulets.
‘‘ From the vitlnlty of thefe druidical remains to thofe three works In Broadfield, near Stocklewath, 
which I mentioned in a formei paper, I think there is reafon to fuppofe that they likewife were the 
works of the ancient Britons.
No Roman coins nor urns have, as far as I could learn, ever been found 
in them.
“ In September laft 1 digged below the foundation of two earns In the work called Stoneralfe.
In one 
was part of a handmill, in the other a clever, as at (D), with leveral pieces of iron much corroded with 
ruft, and wiiich had loft their niagnetlc power.
Allies were fcattered about, but no burnt bones or urns 
were to be found.
“ I again examined the little inclofures In what Is called Caftle-Steads, and found them to be rude

** were in garrifon ; for Congavata lignifies, in Britifh, a vale upon the Gavata, 
which name is now contracted into Cauda; but I have not yet been able to mark 
" out the exact place where it was fcated.” — Mr. Horfley places the Ration Coii- 
gavata at Stanwix, and grounds his opinion on faCts, which we will point out when 
we treat of that place in the courfe of this work.
It is difficult to fix an opinion 
on Roman affairs in Britain, by the etymology of the name of any place; for there 
is fomuch confufion between etymology and the proofs by Roman remains, that it 
would overturn that fpecies of evidence, without we admit that, after the w'riting 
of the Notitia, the fame body of Romans paffed from Ration to Ration, and carried 
with them their altars and facred things.
There are remains of two fmall fquare 
fortifications near Rofe Cafile, one to the N.
N. E.
and the other to the S.
S. W.
about fifty yards wide, which are almoR defaced, the ground having been often 
tilled ; but no coins, or other inferiptions, were ever difeovered.
We proceeded to 
ROSE CASTLE, 
feated on a fine rifing ground, but overlooked by many fuperior eminences to the 
weR and north.
There are no great remains of the ancient quadrangle of which it is 
foundations of walls, formed of undrefled Hones without cement, the fimple conftrudlion of an ancient 
Briton’s houfe, which probably might once have been the refidence of a Britifii chief.
In the progrefs 
the Britons made in building, this feems to be the mode they would naturally adopt, after quitting their 
caves and fubterraneous dwellings.
“ The many Roman ftations and camps, that have been difeovered in Cumberland, and the number 
of altars and inferiptions that have been found in them, induce us to conclude that every work we had 
with a ditch and vallum is a Roman camp, not confidering that the Britons were very numerous in that 
county, before the Romans got poffcHlon of it.
“ Cumberland firft took its name from the inhabitants, who were the true and genuine Britons, and 
called themfelves Kimhri or Kumbri.
Many places retain their ancient Britifh names, fuch as Car-luelt 
Car-dronoc, Penrith^ and Pen-redu.
” The learned Mt. Whitaker fays, “ Very well inhabited, we are afTured Casfar and Diodonis, was 
the whole compafs of the ifland ; and proportionably fo muft every kingdom of it have been, and the 
“ counties of Durham, York, Cumberland, Weflmorland, and Lancafter, are exprefsly declared to have 
“ been uncommonly populous, even before the fettlement of the Romans within them.” 
” Hence I think there is great reafon to fuppofe, that thofe works inclofed with a ditch and vallum, 
where no Roman coins nor inferiptions have been found, were thrown up by the ancient Britons ; not 
always as places of defence, but for holding courts of juflicc and other public meetings.” 
A fmall part of the common of Broadfield is within the chapelry of riighhead, twenty acres of which, 
adjoining to the eflate of Highhead Caftle, were about eighty or ninety years ago inclofed from the common 
by the then lord.
Within this parcel of land, on a dry plain , Hands a round hill, called Souden or Soldsn-Hill, 
about fourteen yards in diameter, probably of forced mould, with a circle of large grey granites on the 
top.
— On opening it in 1788, there appeared feveral Hone cheHs, of about three feet by two feet, with 
all kinds of human bones in complete perfedlion, flviills and jaws, with as fine a let of teeth as ever I 
beheld.
— At about t\^o hundred and fifty yards from thence Hands a very large granite, with aa imperfect 
circle round it Other remains of antiquity appear on the adjoining part of Broadfield.

About three mil.s from the place were the above remains were found, and near Soutbernby, in the 
pariik of Callic Sowerby, is a Roman camp, where hand-mills, a fpear, and other pieces of iron, have 
been dug up.

laid it confided, and indeed little of the caftellated form, but the gateway and two 
towers on the north part.
Above the gate is fculptured a large rofe.
No 
etymology that has been given of the name of this place is fatisfaeftory ; that of 
Rbosy a Britifii word figni Tying a marfny or wet dale, or valley, doth not deferibe 
this place, which lies on the inclination of a hill of dry gravel, and a confiderable 
way above the valley through which the river Caldew Hows.
We might more 
reafonably coniedfure, that it took its name from Roux, tlie red colour of the Hone 
of which it is built.
The role on the tower was probably the device of John dc 
Roffe, who was bifliop in the beginning of the 14th century, fuch devices being 
frequent at that time.
— It makes the moH picturefque appearance from the plain 
near the bridge, for there it rifes from a conliderable eminence, fkirted with;hanging 
gardens ; to the right, an old fquare tower, which we conceived was the conHable’s 
tower, hereafter mentioned : it feems to be the oldeft part of the prefent remains; 
the windows are very fmall, with circular tops; but its antique figure is greatly 
hurt by a fquare roof, crowned with a richly decorated vane.
— The chief fronts of 
the more modern buildings are, from this point, both in view.
The back-ground 
rifes fwiftly, well cultivated, and flieltered with a wood to the weft.
The profpedts 
from the caftle are not very extenfive, but they arc beautiful.
To the caftward, the 
view comprehends a narrow vale of rich meads, through which the high road 
winds; an open wood of ftately trees on the nearer margin of the river; a new 
ftone bridge of three arches croftes the ftream, whofe banks are ornamented with a 
hanging copfe and thick brufhwood.
To the north, the vale is extended, but 
fcattered over w'lth irregular coppices, which make a wild landfcape, terminated 
by diftant eminences.
To the fouth, a rich, though narrow, vale, through which 
the Caldews flows in many meanderings ; the eminences fringed with W'ood, and 
the plain fiiled with cattle.
— This feat of the Bilhops of Carlifle may well be 
termed a pleafant retirement.
The antiquity of this place is not very great ; the 
iirft mention v.'e find made of it, was on account of King Edward L’s taking up 
his rcfidence there in the 28th year of his reign, on his expedition againft the 
Scots : his writs for afiembling the parliament of Lincoln were dated from thence, 
by the diftineftion of Apudle Rofe.
Robert Brus, in his incurfion in the i6th year 
of King Edward II.
burnt this caftle.
In the lofh year of King Edward III.
licence was obtained for fortifying and caftellating the palace of Rofe, during the 
pontificacy of John Halton.
it is probable the fculptured rofe at the gate is 
cotemporary both with the name and caftle.
It fuffered much by the repeated 
incurfions of the Scots, but was as often reftored, till in the wars of King 
Charles I.
it fhared the fate of moft of the northern caftles, and was laid in ruins.
As the occafions were various, fo the repairs and improvements were made at 
fundry feafons.
Bilhop Strickland, who came to this fee in the year 1400, added 
or reftored a principal tower to this caftle.
Bifhop Bell, who came to the fee in 
1478, alfo added or reftored a tower ; and Bilhop Kyte, who was made Bifhop 
of Carlifle in 1521, did the like: with thefe towers, and a ftrong wall and double 
ditch, this place flood till the unhappy sera above mentioned.

A •valuable Correjpondcnt has furnified us zvith this further Account of Rofe Cnftle.
Rose Castle, fo named, perhaps, from the fs^eernefs of its fituation, in a 
plcafant vale watered by the Caldew, is the feat of the BiHjops of Carlifle, and 
appears to have been built at different periods of time.
— Situated near the borders, 
it was a place of ffrength, and, like other caftles irt feudal times, fo conft ruiffed as 
to afford the family protedion from the attacks of an enemy.
— The Bifliops 
Strickland, Kite, and Bell, built thofe towers which Bill retain their names, and, 
perhaps, did rnoB to make it acaBellated houfe and a place of defence.
The wall 
and ditch were kept in good repair, till the civil wars between King Charles I.
and the parliament, when it was burnt down, anno 1652.
— Oliver Cromwell, it is 
faid, marching with his army over Broadfield, a little to the eaB of Rofe CaBle,.
v/as provoked by the ill-timed boafling of a perfon, who fired a gun by way of 
defiance, to change his intention, and demolifh a great part of it : what efcaped 
fire, and was Banding at the reBoration, was fomewhat repaired and made habitable 
by Dr. Stern, then bifhop of the fee.
But Drs., Rainbow and Smith, the two next 
fucceffors, were its greateB benefadors, who, at no fmall expence, added greatly 
thereto.* — We find that all the Bifhops of Carlifle, from the revolution down to 
the prefent time, have done, feme more, fome lefs, to repair and beautify the 
cpifcopal palace.
— Bifliop Fleming laid new floors, and vvainfeotted the drawing- 
room, drefling-room, and kitchen chamber.
— Bifliop Ofbaldiflon made various 
repairs in and about the caflle.
— Bifhop Lyttleton built a new kitchen, (1763) new 
cieled the chapel, and covered Strickland’s tower.
— Bifhop Law built a wall, and 
made the new gateway to the caflle door: he alfo caufed the lead covering to be 
taken off the caflle, and in its Bead one of brown Bate to be put on.
— Bifhop 
Douglas fitted up a new regi Be r -office ; the great flaircafe and landing were of 
oak, thefe he changed for fir, which gives it a more modern and neat appearance: 
he made a new wall from the caflle gate round the pond to the high end of the 
orchard ; a wiall on the ivefl fide of the gate, and new gravelled all the walks in 
the gardennnd court.— The Honourable Dr. Vernon, the prefent bifnop, has made 
fevcral alterations in the houfe, which add greatly to the comfort and convenience 
of it.
He has befides put the eaft, or principal front of the caflle into complete 
repair, and rendered the appearance of it, which before was extremely irregular, 
ruinoiis, and decayed, more uniform and fubflantial.
Several of the old Bones have 
been taken our, and replaced with new ones, and the reftdreffed over to correfpond 
with the new work.
The fafi windows, which ill accorded with the Gothic 
architeefture, have been altered in fuch a manner as to admit of Gothic arches 
being placed over them ; by which means they now correfpond with the other 
windows.
It is faid that he means to extend the fame improvements, as to the 
windows, to the fouth and north fronts of the caflle.

We paired from Rofe Callle to the quarries of (lone on 
SHAWK BECK, 
which, by the extenfivenefs of the workings, confirm the general opinion of the 
antiquity of the place.
The infeription on one of the cliffs (hews that the Romans 
won part of the (lone here for their public works.
By the quality of the freeflone, 
it feems that the materials for the wall near Carlifle, and from thence wellw'ard, 
came from thefe quarries; — and it is alfo probable the (lone for building the 
cathedral of Carlifie, the cadle and city w-alls, was procured here.
— We can add 
no new condrudlion, or defcription, to thofe given by fo many refpedable vifitors, 
more, than that we prefer the form of the infeription given by the Bidiop of 
Carlifie to others; and conceive that the lad letters of the fecond line are FECE, 
which certainly is more confident in its conltrudion, that the foldiers had per- 
formed that work, than merely to record that they cut the infeription.

Rooke, in the communications with which he favoured the Editors, fays, “ it is

What to make of the ftrange fcrawls that accompany this infeription, and of the two lines chieffy 
confiding of perpendicular ilrokes, that Inciofe the words Cohors tertia, Cohors quarto, I know not ; but 
certainly they were the work of a later age, and probably of men who laboured at thefe quarries, merely 
for amufemciil, though It feems rather to have been a laborious amufement, for this part of the rock is 
full five yards in height, accefiible only by ladders, and the ftone exceeding hard, in which thefe marks 
and lines are infeript.
“ Roman Infcriptlons on rocks are veiy rare in Britain, and Indeed throughout Europe, which renders

the foot of Raugh, where Caldew borders it again along Great Raughton field.
“ The Earl Randolph Mefchines firff gave the feigniory to one Robert, that 
** was fecond brother to Hubert de Vallibus, firft Lord of Gilfland, and his heirs, 
“ where- 
time to mention them particularly.
Three out of the four appear to have been the work of the fecond 
Auguftan legion, which, together with the twentieth legion, were employed under the Emperor Severuj 
in building the Roman wall about the years 207 or 208, according to Mr. Horfley’s conjedlure.
“ The author of the Additions to Camden concurs in opinion with Horfley, that the quarries at 
Hellbeck Scar and Leage Cragg afforded the Romans a fupply of ftones for building the famous wall ; 
and the quarries at Crawdundale Wath, for their buildings at Kirby Thore, where they had a very con- 
liderable ftation ; and that upon thefe occafions they left inferiptions behind them.
This conjediure it 
much ftrengthened by the ftrong refemblance obferved by Korfley, both as to nature and colour, between 
the flone of Hellbeck quarry and that of the Roman wall throughout great part of Cumberland : he 
alfo adds, that the inhabitants near the place continue to call it the Old Qiiarry.
“ I have fome fufpicion that, if the old done quarries fituate in that part of Northumberland which 
lies contiguous to the Roman wall were carefully examined, fimllar inferiptions might be difeovered ; for 
the fame motives which led the builders of the famous wall to leave their names and memorials on the 
Cumberland rocks and quarries from whence the done was procured, would induce them to do the like 
near that part of the wall which lies near Northumberland, where the flones for building were alfo in like 
manner procured.
“ The qaarries at Shawk, w’here this Infcriptlon remains, are at this day the mod famous In all the 
country, and by the Immenfe quantity of dones which appear to have been taken from them, mud certainly 
have been worked for feveial ages.
There Is no doubt, therefore, but that the Romans had ufed them : 
and, if not for the building that part of the wall which lies towards Burgh, or Boulnefs, yet for their 
ftation at Olenacum, or Old Carlille, near adjoining to it; or elfe for Luguballia, or the prefent Carhfle.|) 
“ Before I conclude this letter, I mud obferve, that the infcriptlon on the Hellbeck Scar is placed 
like this at Shawk, a confiderable height above the furface of the ground on which the rock dands, and 
confequently difficult of accefs, and yet in Mi. Camden’s time, wffio deferibes it, the words “ Officiuni 
Romamrum'' were legible jud on the right fide of the infcriptlon, though now indeed much defaced.
— 
This, like the fcrawl, < 3 cc.
which accompanies the Shawk infcriptlon, mud have been the work of a later 
hand, and, by the form of the letter CID, I (hould pronounce it of the early Norman age.
A human face 
is Infculped alfo jud over the fird word of the Roman Infcriptlon, which is reprefented both In Camden 
and Hoiflcy far lefs rude than It really is ; for It appears on the done almoft as barbarous as that we fee 
uft below the Shawk infcriptlon.” 
The following Account of Shawk parries was fiirnijhed by a Gentleman in that Neighbourhood.
The brook on the weft fide of the manor of Daldon is varioufly named, Shalk-beck, Shawk-beck, Chalk- 
heck : it runs into a level bog two miles in length, and half a mile In width, amongft reeds and bulrufhes, 
and no vifible channel or courfe any further appears, and may properly take the name thence of Choke- 
beck, being choked.
It joins l.ough-beck, and they together take the name of Wampool to the fea.
The etymology of Glave-hill, near Daldon, fignifies fword hill, glave being a name for the long fword^ 
hence the Glave-hill is fuppofed to be a hill where military exercifes or executions were ufed.
The traditional name of the rock at Choke-beck, whereon the Roman infcriptlon is cut, has, beyond the * 
memoiy of man, been that of Tom Smith’s Leap ; one Smith being purfued for fome felonious adlion, 
refulutely leaped down from off its top, and was killed.

The fine regular ftrata of found ftonc that lie here, dipping to the noith at about five and a half inches in 
the yard, and fliooting up their ends alternately for a mile in length, towards the fouth, againft a compaft 
covering of clay, are fcarce any wdreie to be equalled.
Thofc ftrata of found freeftone are of various 
thickneffes, and generally of a red or white colour; but oftentimes both red and white freeftone are found 
in the fame ftratum.
They are feparated from each other by beds of a greafy, red-coloured ramble ftone, 
full of joints, intermixed with layers of abluifti caft, which are of more compadfnefs than the former, but 
when expofed to the weather, become like the former, a heap of Ihivers.
Each ftratum of ftone is 
divided by perpendicular fifiures of about half an inch in width, filled with a tough red clay, running 
nearly parallel to each other, from fouth to north, at different diftances, but feldom exceeding fix yards.
The intermediate ftones laying between thofe fiffures are called keys by the quarrymen, and the iiffures on 
the far fide of the key are called a back.
Each key is compofed of a number of layers of ftone, of a 
different thicknefs, which the workmen call pojis.
The principal band of ftone now worked here being the firft ftratum of found freeftone” above Tom 
Smith’s Leap ; it is about fourteen or fifteen feet in thicknefs, and confifts of the following different 
layers of ftone :

— The depth of clay above this band of ftone Is about 
eight yards and a half, befides a confiderable depth of ramble ftone.
At a diftance of about a quarter of a mile to the fouth of Tom Smith’s Leap, there lies a band of 
llmeftone, which.
In all probability, continues acrofs the country, from fea to fea, in a direftion nearly 
E. N.
E. : it Is lefs than one hundred yards In width, where it ftiews itfelf at Choke -beck, and was here 
difcovered of late years by Mr. Stockdale, It being hid under a thick bed of red ramble.
Here is a fulphur fpring, that arifes from the limeftone rock, which goes by the name of Helly-lVcU, 
viz.
Holy-Well: it formerly was reforted to by the youths of the neighbouring villages on a Sunday after- 
noon, where the genius of the well taught its votaries the virtues of temperance, health, fimplicity, and 
love.
But of late years, few enjoy Its bleflings more than the quarrymen, who make it their common 
beverage.
The lime that is burned at this quarry is a grey lime; and, for its ftrong cementing quality in build- 
ing, is feldom equalled, it being of a very greafy nature.
— There are a great variety of petrefaftions 
found in this quarry, particularly (hells of different kinds.
The dip of this limeftone is towards the fouth- 
eaft, at about four inches in the yard, and the perpendicular fiffures, which go through the different layers, 
as deep as the qirarry has yet been worked, run In feveral direftions.
It is to be remarked, that the 
freeftone to the north of this limeftone dips immediately north ; whilft this limeftone, and all the ftone 
fouthward, dips towards the fouth-eaft.
What a ftrange diverfity in nature muft be here, where thefe 
various ftrata nearly approach each other !
The ftone laying on the fouth fide of the limeftone.
Is of a very different quality of ftone to that on the 
north, already mentioned: this being a very white-grained ftone, Intermixed with brown, red, and black 
fpots.
Near to the limeftone, the grit is remarkably fmall, and as the limeftone wears a whitilh caft, 
they refemble each other very much ; but, by a nearer infpeftion, the difference is eafily perceived.
As 
you go farther up the beck to the fouth, the grit of the ftone becomes move coarfe, and much iron is 
vifible therein.
The whole of this ftone lays In very broken ftrata ; and here feveral fmall ftrata of iron 
make their appearance.
The Green Quarries, which ftlll He further fouth, have for the laft forty years produced the moft and 
the fineft red dates of any quarry in the county.
They appear to be a ftray ftrata of ftone, but lie fimilar to 
the other freeftone quarries.
— The whole of thofe quarries employ annually between forty and fifty mafons 
and quarrymen.
Cunning-garth Is fo fituated, that It commands a profpeft of the furrounding country : It has much 
the appearance and fituation of a Roman intrenchment, being a fquarc of about forty yards each fide.
— 
In its vicinity are feveral ancient barrows.
— Going down the weft fide of Choke-beck, we went pad 
Lady Hills Quarry, being Immediately oppolite to Tom Smith’s Leap, on the Weftward fide.
I take 
this to have been the quarry wherein the Romans worked, by the extenfivenefs of the old workings here, 
and more fo by feeing, fome time ago, Roman names engraven on the back of the quarry.
The colour 
of the ftone dug here Is moftly a white tinged with a little orange, or a very light grey, and fome red.
After crofting Choke bridge, where we again re-entered Dalfton parifli, we came to Toddle-hiil, probably 
Tod-Hill, or Fox-Hill as a number of foxes have been dug out here.
This appears to be an artificial hill 
of garvel and fand heaped up to an extraordliiaiy fize.
This hill is about forty yards in diameter at its 
bafe, and about feveii yards In perpendiciilar height, and is in all probability a Roman barrow It 
fupplies the Inhabitants here with materials to make and repair their public and private roads.
Urns 
have at different times been found, containing afttes, (Icull bones, &c.
furrounded with ftones, which, 
when expofed to the air, foon crumble to pieces.
This hill is about an hundred yaids fouth of the

DALSTON.
It doth not appear where the baronial feat was ; but it is moft probable Rofe 
Caftle was, from the firfl: grant of the barony to the fee of Carlifle, the fortrefs as 
well as place of the baron’s refidence.f 
Little Dalston was a dependent manor within the barony.
One would con- 
ceive, from its name, that this had been the baronial manfion ; but the idea is 
immediately deftroyed by the manor being mefne.
“ Robert de Dalflon, brother of Hubert de Gilfland aforefaid, had another 
brother, named Reginald, to whom Earl Randolph Mefchines gave the manor of 
“ Caflle Sowerby, Carlatton, and Hubertby, as appeareth in the title of Sowerby.
“ The faid Robert de Dalfton had Iffiie a fon, whofe poflerity, in the eldeft line, 
by a daughter, transferred the right of the feigniory ofDahion to the Harclas ; 
“ wherefore, after that, K.
Henry 111.
had granted away the barony to the Blfliop 
of Carlifle, which his grandfather, K.
Henry, had feized as an efcheat taken from 
“ the Scots.
One Michael de Harcla (father to Andrew Harcla, fome time Earl 
of Carlille) did implead Robert Cherry, Bifhop of CarliAe, in the i ft year of 
“ King Edward I.
in Michaelmas term, for the faid barony, in a writ of right.
Infra terras et bofeas prasdidll manerii.
Et quod nullu, fine prsedidti epifeopis et fuccefibrum fuorum

“ And by another charter, the fame king further grants, tliat if they, or any perfon with their per- 
mifiion, fhall chafe any game within their foreft of Dalfton, and the fame game (hall fly into the king’* 
foreft, they may purfue and take the fame within the king’s foreft, and return without the moleftation 
of any of the king’s forefters or other officers.” 
\ Great Dalfton is ftated to be a mixed manor, confifting of 20 freehold tenements, 114 copyholds, 
40 cuftomary tenements, 40 leafeholders for lives.
A copyholder, on death or alienation, pays to the lord a year’s rent for a fine.
May demife for any 
term.
The wood growing on his land may fell, &c.
The widow is entitled to a third of all lands her 
hulband was feifed of during coverture.
The hulband has the wife’s land for life.
Female heirs inherit in 
coparcenary.
In mortgages, there muft be a furrender, and one year’s lent paid for a fine.
The 
mortgager continuing in pofleffion, his heir is admitted, though the mortgager has forfeited the legal 
eftate.
The cuftomary tei.ements pay two years’ rent on change of tenant, but nothing on change of lord.
— 
The widow is dowable in one-third of the lands of which her hulband died feifed, and the eldeft female 
heir inherits.
The hulband has no eftate in his wife’s lands after her death.
All conveyances pafs by 
deed, furrender, and admittance.
A full fine is paid on mortgage, but the mortgagor continuing in 
pofleffion, his heir is admitted.
The cuftomary tenant is entitled to his wood, to win limeftone on the commons as well as inclofures, 
and get clay for bricks for ereftiois on the lands, but not for fale.
By feveral decrees in Chancery, it has been fettled, that the tenants of Dalfton fliall not pay toll at 
Carlifle.
So that they have the privilege of exemption, as well for corn as other goods and things brought 
there for the ufe of them and their famdies, as foi any goods or commodities wrought up or manufafluiod 
by them, or cattle bought, fed, or grazed on their lands.
But the fame not to extend to badgers, 
drovers, &c.
There is a peculiar cuftom refpeftiug the cuftomary and copyhold lands in this manor ; that is, a wife 
cannot be deprived of dower by the hulband felling or furrendering the eftate in his life time, unlefs Ihe 
joins in fuch fmrender ; but how the cuftom has been eftablilhed, and whether of any antiquity, we arc 
not certainly informed.

" brother the manor of Little Dalfton, whofe pofterity, in the ilfue male, yet enjoy 
the fame to this day lineally; for the moft part defcended from father to fon, and 
fometimes collaterally from brother to brother, as appeareth from this true 
pedigree, gathered by furvey of divers ancient evidences, yet extant, that may 
** prove the fame :

No iffue male.
Sold the ellatc, in 1761, to Monkhoufe Davifon, Efq. 4 daughter!.
for 5060!.
Mr. Davifon died in 1793, and the truftees under his will fold it, with 
Blackwell- Hall and Peafetree, in 1795, to John Sowerby, of London, Efq. a native 
of its neighbourhood, for upwards of three times that fum, and was thought a cheap 
purchafe.
Dalsto.v-Hall is undoubtedly very ancient ; but, as there is no date or record 
to be found, the time of its ercdlion cannot be afeertained.
On the front of the 
houfe, which was the principal entrance, are placed fpouts, to carry off the water 
from the roof, made to refemble the old forged cannon, differently ornamented.
— 
Under the fpouts is cut, in relief, an arrow pointed againft a man’s head.
Upon 
the cornice above the fpouts is placed a head, which we take to be of Roman 
fculpture, and w as probably defigned for the head of Jupiter Ammon.
It evidently 
appears never to have been originally intended to be placed where it now ftands,.
as it has no kind of fixture, and it may eafily be flioved about.
In the field fronting the houfe are traces of a Roman camp; the ditch and 
vallum are perfed on one fide: and near it is a barrow, now planted with firs.
— 
It is therefore probable that the head was found near this fpot.
— On the fione fillet 
above a window of the third ftory is the following infeription, cut in the Old 
Englifti charaders, rcvcifed, — a fac fimile of which is- given in page 442, at C: 
3[oSn SDalflon, ffilfalier tuifte, mao ^js I'ijtOERg.
In other fillets of the flones are the figures of a rat and cat; alfo four fiiields with 
the Dalffon arms.
At the end of a dark paffage is a very ftrong iron gate, with two bolts and a 
hafp.
This was intended to fecure the chapel (which is now ufed as a milk-houfe) 
and ffair-cafe which led to the rooms above, which probably contained their things 
of value.
In feveral parts of the houfe there are remains of its ancient grandeur.
Cardew was another dependent manor within this barony.
It confifts of about 
fourteen cuftomary tenements, was parcel of the forefi: of Inglewood, and was be- 
gun to be cultivated foon after the conqueft.
In 1672, the tenants were infran- 
chifed by George Denton, Efq. their lord, referving a fmall quit-rent and the 
royalties.
In 1686, he fold the manor to the anceftor of the prefent proprietor.
Lord Lonfdale.
“ The manor or town of Cardew, in the barony of Dalffon, was anciently 
“ called Kar-tbeiv, i.
c. palus jive marijeus deorum, and took firff name of that great 
“ fenny ground, at the head of the river Wampool, now called Cardew Mire, and 
“ of the antient inhabitants which is, by interpretation, God’s fen, or 
God’s bogg, and fo called by them becaufe it adjoined to Thurlby, where the 
Danes had a houfe or temple of facrifice, or a public place where thofe Pagans 
" offered 
DALSTON.

" offered up the blood of captives to a god Thor, whom in that fort they honoured, 
as Everardus, feme time Abbot of Holm Cultram, hath regiflered to pofterity, 
" who lived in the days of King Henry II.
** Cardew was anciently a foreft ground, as all the reft of the barony of Dalfton 
*' was before it was inhabited, and part of the great foreft of Englewood, and be- 
“ came firft inhabited in William Rufus or Henry I.’s time.
The firft inhabitant 
I read of, was one William, who took firname of the place, and was called 
“ William de Karthew', I read of that name likewife one Stephen and one 
“ Thomas de Karthew : the laft inheritor fold his patrimony to one Barrington, a 
“ chaplain jw hich Barrington gave the fame to the Bifliop of Carlifle, in truft to 
“ the ufe of John Burdon.
John Burdon had iffue a fon, called alfo John Burdon, 
“ to whom his father gave the land to him and the heirs of his body ; and for de- 
“ fault of fuch iffue, to John Denton and Joan his wife, and the heirs of their 
bodies, whofe iffue male, lineally defeended from father to fon, enjoy the fame 
“ at this day in that right.
The laid John Denton was lord alfo of Ainftaplighe, 
“ and of the foreft of Garnarie and Kirkpatrick’ and Irongrey, in Scotland, 
“ which he had of the gift of Edward Baliol, King of Scots, His letters patent 
" thereof were fealed in the Ifle of Eaftholm.
The faid John Denton was the 
“ fteward of all Annerdale, under the Lord Humphrey de Bohune, Earl of 
*' Hereford and Effex, Lord High Conftable of England, to whom the faid Edward 
“ Baliol, or John Baliol his father, gave the whole feigniory of Annerdale, which 
was anciently the Bruces’ lands.
The faid John Denton deferved fo well in 
" thofe wars betwixt the Baliols and Bruces, competitors for the crown of Scotland, 
that Baliol, then king, preferred him to that foreft late the Bifhop of Glafgow’s 
" lands, and to Kirkpatric, late the lands of Sir James Friflbld, adherents to the 
“ Bruces’ faeftion : and the Earl of Hereford preferred him to the ftewardfhip of 
" Annerdale, the principal office in that feigniory, for that he firft entered the 
” fame, and held it to the earl his mafter’s ufe in defpite of the Bruces’ fadion ; 
" and when Baliol was banifhed Scotland, he kept ftill the principal houfe till it 
" w'as fired under him, heated and undermined till it was ready to fall ; whereupon 
" his heirs give now in remembrance thereof for their creft a caftle or tower fable, 
“ with flames ifluing out of the top thereof, and demi lion rampant, v/ith a fword 
in his right paw iffuing out of the flames.” Denton’s MS.
Mr. Denton, whofe curious manufeript we copy out at length in this work, was 
owner of this manor, and refided at Cardcw-Hall.
It is faid, that, “ in one of the copies of the manufeript, which Bifhop Nicolfon 
“laid was lent to him by Mr. Bird, of Brougham, in lyof), is the following

We are induced to believe, the etymology of names having ’Thor or Thur in 
them, being taken for holy places confecrated to the Saxon deity Thor, are very 
erroneous.
Thur is a Danifh word, and fignifics a brook or rivulet ; fo that names 
of places having that compound, denote their natural fituations, as 
Tburjby, &c.
We know of no places, whofe names arc fo compounded, which do 
not lie on the banks of fome brook.
The contrary would take away the Danifh 
derivation which we have adopted.

About the conqueH’, it was foreft and wahe ground, until a great purprefture 
“ was there enclofed by one Uchtred, and entered to King William Rufus, to be 
" holden in fee farm and by ferjeantry, for keeping the aeries of hawks which bred 
“ in the foreft of Englewood for the king: and then the Raughtons gave a fparrow 
“ haw k for their cognizance ; and thefe arms w ere borne by the Raughtons, viz.
" by John Raughton and William his brother in King Edward lll.’s time.
— 
" Their firft anceftor, Uchtred aforefaid, had iftue Roger, Richard, and William, 
whofe iirue fucceflively were called by the (irname of Raughton, of the place where 
“ they dwelt.
Roger gave part of his lands to his brother there, and every one of 
“ them increafed his polfeflions within the foreft of Englewood, by renting pur- 
“ preftures of the king at Sebergham, Raughton, Gaitlkaile, Brackenthwaite, and 
“ elfewhere.
One of their pofterity gave Little Raughton field to the Bifhop of 
Carlifle.
The laft of Roger’s name gave the manor of Raughton to Margaret 
“ Stapleton, his wife, and her heirs, for want of iftue betw een them.
Thereupon 
“ William Stapleton, of Edenhall, her brother, became heir to her of Raughton, 
“ and by the heir general of the Stapletons it fell to the Mufgraves, who enjoyed the 
** fame, till Humphrey Mufgrave fold it to the tenants in fee.” — Denton’s MS.
Dalston is a confiderable village on the banks of Caldew'; exceedingly much 
improved fince the- cotton manufadfories were eftablifhed by the late George 
Hodfon.* There is a crofs at the eaft end of the town, raifed on feveral fteps, the 
pillar fculptured wdth many coats of arms ; among w hich is a fhield bearing three 
kites’ heads, which was the arms of Bilhop Kite, and feems to refer the date of the 
erecEion to his time.
On one fhield is a triple combination of crofTes, no un- 
common fymbol of the Trinity.
Two other fnields have the bearings of fome 
perfons who probably contributed to the work.
" Croffes, foon after the eftablifh- 
“ ment of Chriftianity in this iftand, were put up in moff places qf public concourfe, 
“ to remind the people of the benefit vouchfafed to us by the crofs of Chrift.

We fign children in 
baptifm with the fign of the crofs.” To thefe we may add, that the fign of the 
crofs was ufed manually by Chriftians, to difiinguifli their profefiion, in contra- 
diftindlion to others, who ufed typical figns to fhew their peculiar religious tenets.
The Jews in their religious ceremonies have many figns, and extend their hands in 
a particular pofition at the elevatioit of the tables of the law.
The Freemafons 
alio derived from certain feeftaries figns exprefiive of the vows they had accepted ; 
and it is not to be doubted the fign of the crofs was originally ufed to communicate, 
that the perfon who exhibited the fame had made profeffion of Chriftianity.
There was an hermitage near Dalfton ; the reclufe, in 1343, who occupied it, 
was called Hugh de Lilford; but where his cell was, or when, or by whom it w’as 
firfl confirucled, there is no record or tradition to point out.
It feems there was a 
chapel appertaining to it, dedicated to Sir Wynomius the bifliop; and indulgences 
were granted by Bifhop Kirby to encourage the reparation of it, and giving thereto 
books and ornaments.
At fome diftance from the church of Dalfton, a field, called 
Chapel Flat, feems to point out the fite; the vale is deep and romantic, environed 
by fine rocks and hanging w’oods, and watered by the river which winds through 
the valley.
In addition to what we have noted before, we repeat Nicolfon and Burn’s 
defeription of an ancient monument near Dalfton — “ There was anciently here a 
Britifh temple, or fomething of that fort, is evident, for a good many years ago 
“ a circle of rude ftones, (each) about three feet in diameter, was difeovered ; the 
whole circle being about thirty yards in circumference.
And within the circle, 
tow'ards the eaft point, w ere found four ftones, much of the fame form as the 
reft, lying one upon another, fuppofed to be fome of the kiftvaen kind.
Not far 
*' from thence was a very regular tumulus or barrow^ about eight yards in diameter 
** at the bottom, and two at the top, and about three yards in height.
When 
opened, there were found near the top two freeftoncs, about three feet long, one 
foot broad, and fix inches thick, w'hich had a fort of circle, very rudely cut out, 
or marked near the top, but nothing vva« found underneath, though the ground 
was opened above four feet below the level.” — This tumulus fupports an opinion 
which we have long entertained, that the Druids’ temple fuffered no defilement 
by fepulture.
This tomb probably contained the remains of one of that tribe, 
from its vicinity to the circle.
The circle cut on the ftone was their common 
emblem, and correfponded with the religious emblems of the Egyptian philo- 
fophers.
The parilh of Dalfton* is of confidcrable extent; in Bifaop Kirby’s regifterthe 
boundaries are deferibed as they were taken in the year 1333 — “ i.imites er bundte

Soil, Produce, and Agriculture ] The foil in general Is loamy ; near the town of Dalfton there 
is dry and gravelly land ; and, in general, the arable land cannot be called wet.
Every kind of grain 
and roots thiive very well here.
The methods of cultivating the ground are various, according to the 
humour or circumftances of the farmer ; but, in general, the farmers are Induftrious, the land kept In good 
order, rendered fertile, and produces good crops, particularly of wheat, on which the farmer prlncipally 
depends.
Buckabank is a place remarkable for growing wheat, inftances having been known of 18 or 20 
buffiels returned for one of feed.
About the town of Dalfton, fince the great increafe of inhabitants, the 
land has been much laid down to grafs for pafturage and meadow.

Aspect, Buildings, Wood, and General Appearance.] A great pait of the arable land in this 
pariih is fituated rather low, inclining gently to the river Caldew, which has its courfe through the parilh 
northwards.
In general the land is neither remarkably level in any parts, or very hilly in other parts.
Near the rivers the banks are woody, and many trees are in the hedge-rows.
Along the weft fide of the 
river Caldew, is a long ftripe of fine level and feitile land, fituated low, and well ftieltered with wood ; in 
this pleafant vak there are a number of good houfes.— Dalfton-Hall ftands to the northward, on a riling 
ground ; near Dalfton is a good houfe, built by Mr. Hodfen, the proprietor of the cotton manufactory 
there a little way further up the river is Hawlledale-Hall, the property of Mr. Nicolfon, of CarliHe ; 
about two furlongs to the fouth is Holme- Hill, the manfion of Mr. Holme, in a very agreeable fituatlon; 
a little further to the fouth is Rofe Caftle.
— An extenfive common lies in the weft part of the parilh, a 
part of which is of a wet, black, barren foil, intermixed with white ftones, and covered with heath ; no 
part is mountainous.
According to the tithing-man’s book, the number of Iheep Ihorn laft year was

Housman’s Notes.
There is a well-drawn charaCler of Sir George Dalston, by the learned and pious Dr. Jeremy 
Taylor, and printed at the end of his Worthy Co 7 nmunicant, the 6th edition, in 1701, 8vo, in a fermou 
faid to have been preached at Dalfton, in Cumberland, September 28th, 1657 ; the ftile and fentiments 
of which are fo peculiar and ftriking, that, as the book is not now common, we allure ourfelves our 
readers will be pleafed with fome extraCls from it.
He is there faid to have been “ defeended from an ancient and worthy houfe in Cumberland ; and to 
have adorned his family and extraClion with a more worthy comportment.
— He was bred at Cambridge, 
and was afterwards much at the court of Queen Elizabeth : but, left the levities of youth Ihould be 
fermented by the liberties of a rich and fplendid court, his friends thought it beft that he Ihould grow 
ripe in the fobrieties of a country life, and a married ftate ; in which he behaved himfelf with fo great 
worthinefs, and gave fuch probation of his love of juftice, popular regards of his country’s good, and 
** abilities to ferve them, that, for almoft forty years together, his country chofe him for their knight to 
ferve in all the intereftlng parliaments ; where he was a leading man ; prevailing there by his great 
reputation of juftice and integrity.
And yet he was not unpleafant and hated at court.
For he had 
well underftood, that true interefts of courts and parliaments were one ; and that they are like the 
humours of the body : if you Increafe one beyond the limit that deftroys all the reft, and itfelf at laft.
** And when they look upon themfelves as enemies, and that hot and cold muft fight, the prevailing 
“ part is abated in the confllft, and the vanquifhed part is deftroyed.
But, when they look upon them- 
** felves as varieties, ferving the different afpedfs and neceffities of the fame body, they are for the allay 
of each other’s exhorbitances and exceffes ; and by keeping their own meafures, they preferve the man.
“ This the good man well underftood : for he fo comported himfelf, that he was refpedled by parliaments, 
and loved by kings.
“ God was pleafed to Inveft him with a marvellous fweet nature ; which Is certainly to be reckoned as 
“ one half of the grace of God ; becaufe a good nature, being the rellqucs and remains of that (hipwreck 
“ which Adam made, is the proper and immediate difpofitlon to holinefs ; as the corruption of Adam 
was to difobedience and peevilli counfels.
A good nature will not upbrade the more imperfefl per- 
“ fons, will not deride the ignorant, will not reproach the erring man : will not fmitc finners on the face, 
will not defpife the penitent.
A good nature is apt to forgive injuries, to pity the miferable, to 
“ refeue the opprefftd, to make every ones condition as tolerable as he can ; and fo would he.

“ when good nature is heightened by the grace of God, that which was natural becomes now fpiritual ; 
“ fo theie aftions which proceeded from an excellent nature, and were pieafing and ufeful to men, when 
“ they derive froin a new principle of grace, they become pleafant in the eyes of God : then obedience 
“ to laws Is duty to God ; julllce is rigliteoufnefs, bounty becomes gracioufnefs, and alms is charity.
“ And indeed this is a grace In which this good man was very remarkable, being very frequent aiid 
“ much In alms, tender-hearted to the poor, open-hearted to relieve th.-ir needs.
He was of a meek and 
“ gentle fpirit, but not too foft, he knew how to do good, and how to put by an injury ; but 1 have 
heard it told by them that knew his life, that being, by the unavoidable trouble of a great eftate, 
“ engaged in great fuits at law, he was never plaintiff, but always on the defcnfive part ; and that he had 
“ reafon on his fide and jullice for him, I need alledge no other tefiimony, but that the fentence of his 
“ judges fo declared it : — but that in which I propound this good man moft imitable, was in his 
“ religion, for he was a great lover of the church ; a conflant attender to the fermons of the church ; a 
“ diligent hearer of the prayers of the church, and an obedient fon to perform the eemmands of the 
“ church.
He was diligent in his times and circumllances of devotion ; he would often be at church fo 
“ early, that he was feen to walk long In the church-yard before prayers, being as ready to confefs his 
“ fin at the beginning, as to receive the blelling at the end of prayers.
Indeed he was fo great a loveir 
“ of fermons, that though he knew how to value that which was the beft, yet he was patient of that 
“ which was not fo, and If he could not learn any thirrg to improve his faith, yet he would find fomething 
“ to exercife his patience, and fomething for charity ; yet this his great love of fermons, could not tempt 
“ him to a willingnefs of neglefting the prayers of the church ; of which he was a great lover to his 
“ dying day.
Ova 7 nex exaudiunt vocem ?>ieam, (fays Chrift) my flieep hear my voice, aud fo the church.
“ fays, my fheep hear my voice, they love my woi'ds, they pray in my forms, they obferve my orders, 
“ they delight In my offices, they revere my minifters, and obey my conftitutlons : and fo did he ; loving 
“ to have his foul recommended to God, and his needs reprefented, and his fins confefied, and his pardon 
“ implored in the words of his mother, in the voice and accent of her that nurfed him up to a fpiritual 
“ life, to be a man in Chrift Jefus.
“ He was Indeed a great lover, and had a great regard for God’s minifters, evei^ remembering the words 
“ of God, keep my reft, and reverence my prieft.s, he honoured the calling in all, but he loved and revered 
“ the petfons of fuch who were confeientious keepers of their depojltmn, that truft which was committed 
“ to them ; fuch which did not for intereft quit their confcience, and did not to preferve fome parts of 
“ their revenue, quit fome portions of their religion.
He knew that what was true in 1 639, was alfo 
“ true In 1644, and fo to 57, and ftiall continue true to eternal ages ; and they that changed their per- 
“ fuafions by force or intereft, did neither believe well nor ill, upon competent and juft grounds : they 
“ are not juft, though they happen to be on the right fide.
Hope of gain did by chance teach them 
“ well ; and fear of lofs abufes them diredlly.
He pitied the perfecuted, and never would take part with 
“ perfecutors.
He prayed for his prince, and ferved him In what he could ; he loved God, and loved 
“ the church : he was a lover of his country’s liberties, and yet an obferver of the laws of his king.
“ Thus he behaved himfelf to all his fuperior relatives ; to his equals and dependants he was alfo juft 
“ and kind and loving.
He was an excellent friend, laying out his own intereft, to ferve theirs ; fparing 
“ not himfelf, that he might ferve them ; as knowing foclety to be the advantage of man’s nature, and 
“ friendffiip the ornament of fociety, and urefulnefs the ornament of friendftiip : and in this he was known 
“ to be very worthy.
He was tender and careful of his childien, and fo provident and fo wife, fo lovino- 
“ and obliging to his whole family, that he juftly had that love and regard, that duty and obfervance, 
“ from them which his kindnefs and his care had merited.
He was a careful and provident conduffor of 
“ his eftate ; but far from covetoufnefs, as appeared toward the evening of his life, in which that vice 
“ does moft ufually prevail amongft old men, who are moft greedy when they have leaft need, and load 
“ their fumpters fo much the more, by how much nearer they are to their journey’s end : but he made 
“ a demonftratloa of the contrary ; for he waflied his hands and his heatt of the world, gave up his eftate

THE PARISH OF THURSBY, 
(in CUMBERLANt) V/ARD.J 
I N this parifh there are three diftincft manors, viz.
Thuriby, Crofton, and 
Parton.
Herbert de Brun had Thuriby of the gift of Alan, fecond Lord of Allerdale, 
and he aiTumed the name of Thuriby.
By a iemale heir, Thuriby paiTed to Guido 
Boyvil, in marriage, who was a younger fon of the houfe of Levington: and, by 
the efcheats of King Edward I.
we find Sir William de Boyvil, Knight, poiTeiTed 
thereof.
He had a brother John.
They were both forelfers in Allerdale, from 
Shawk to Elne, the weilward of the foreli of Inglewood.
After Sir William, Sir 
John was poiTeired of Thuriby.
— This eftate afterwards came to be the poifeilion 
of Robert de Ogle,- whofe fon, Thomas de Ogle, in the 38th year of King 
Edward III.’s reign, though then under age, we find by the records of the church, 
prefented a redtor to Thurfby.
In the 9th King Edward IV.
Sir Robert Ogle 
held the manor, with the advowion of the church, of the Lord Dacrc, by knights’ 
fervice, as a dependent of the barony of Burgh.
The Dacres w'ere afterwards 
feized thereof, and united it wdth the barony.
William Lord Dacre, it appears 
by the knights’ fees of the 35th of King Henry VIII.
held the fame of the crown 
by knights’ fervice, and 25s.
8d.
cornage.
— We are informed, that it hath not 
been held in feveralty iince that time.
The manor of Crofton, in King John’s time, was the property of Sir Gilbert, 
fon of Gilbert de Dundraw, who having only female ilfue, the manor paffed by 
marriage to Crofton; whofe fuccelTor, in the 43d King Edward 111 .
Sir John 
Crofton, having one only daughter, Margaret, flie married Ifold Brifeo, and tranf- 
ferred the pofTeflions of the houfe of Crofton to that family, in which they continue 
to this day.
In Denton’s MS.
with Gilpin’s Additions, we ,have the followdng 
account of Crofton, and the family of Brifeo : “ Crofton is the next town and manor 
“ to Thurfby, in the parifli of Thuriby, and lies betwixt Thuriby and Parton to- 
wards the eaft and weft, and between the rivers of Wampool and the Pow on the 
“ fouth and north.
It is called Croft-town^ of the word croft, as the town ftanding 
upon the crofts.
The firft lord that I read of the fame was a knight.
Sir Gilbert, 
the fon of Gilbert de Dundraw.
He gave a parcel of the fame to the hofpital 
" of Sr. Nicholas of Carlifle, and boundcred it out in the place called Gillmartin 
“ Riddin.
He lived in King John’s time.
He bound that land to grind at his 
“ mill at Crofton.
— Next after him, the Lords of Crofton had to their lirnamc 
Crofton, as John de Crofton, Robert de Crofton, John de Crofton, Clement dc 
“ Crofton.
They had lands in Carlifle and Birkfkeugh, which, corruptly, is called 
“ Brulkough and Brifeo.
One Ifold de Brilkow married the heir of Crofton, 
“ whofe pofterity, in the ilfue male, have hitherto enjoyed the fame; and at this 
“ day, John Brifeo, an infant, the fon of William, fon of John, Ion of Robert, who 
“ was flain at Sollorn Mofs, was lord thereof.
“ They wxre called De Birkfkeugh, becaufe their firft anceftors dwelt at 
“ Birkfkeugh, or Birchwood, a place by Newbiggin, in a lordihip belonging to the 
M m rn 2 “ priory 
PARISH OF THURSBY.
45S 
“ priory of Carlifle, which lands they yet enjoy, or part thereof.
And when Gualo, 
" Cardinal of St. Martin in King John’s time, and after him Randolph, in King 
“ Henry III.’s time, as legates from the pope, made dillribution of the lands 
“ belonging to the church of Carlifle between the bifhop and the prior, which, 
'' till then, were \io\dttVL per ivdivijo ; the faid firft-namcd John de Crofton held 
the fame land in Brifco, as freeholder.* They gave to their arms three grey- 
“ hounds fable currant, in a field d’or; which, as I think, the herald devifed 
“ alluding to the word birkjkughy which, in the Britifh tongue, implies agility in 
leaping; from which word the Saxons took the word fr/Jl’, or leap: — but their 
right name is De Birkjkeugh.
Thefe words, fkeugh^ Jcaugh^ JkaWy Jhaw, I have 
“ feen in antient evidences thus differently written, yet always importing the fame, 
“ viz.
a wood ground (landing on a hill, as this Birkfkeugh and Whinnaw Shaw, 
their own land fo called in old evidences, Middleflceugh and iVIiddlefkough.
— 
Three pieces of land in Dalflon, called the Skaw', the Little Skaw', and Rayfon’s 
“ Skaw, named in old writings Skaugh or Scough.
John Brifco, grandfather to the above faid infant, added to his Crofton creft 
“ a greyhound fable, bearing a hare proper.
“ John de Crofton gave lands to the priory of Carlifle : his fcal was a pelican 
“ and her young ones in her nefl: under her.
Robert his fon gave lands alfo to the 
church of Carlifle : he fealed with a lily pot of flowers.
7 he Pedigree of the Brifco s is as foUotveth : 
'‘ Robert Brifco, Lord of Brifco — Allan, fon of Robert — Jurdain, fon of Allan 
— Robert, fon of Jurdain — John Brifco, fon of Robert.
He lived amo 6th King* 
“ Edw. IJ.
as appears by a releafe made to him by his mother of her dower — Ifold 
Brifco, who married Margaret, one of the daughters and heirs of John de Crofton, 
“ Knight, temp.
King Richard II.
— Chriftopher Brifco, fon of Ifold, Lord of 
“ Crofton, Bi iflco, and Dundraw-Robert Brifco, fon of Chriftopher, married Ifabel, 
“ daughter of William Dykes of Warthole — Robert Brifleo, fon of Robert — John 
“ Brifco, fon of Robert, married with Salkeld of Corby — Richard Brifco, fon of 
" John, married with Leigh of Frifington — Robert Brifco, fon of Richard, married 
* “ It appears by antient writings, dated norv in the cuhody of John Brifco, Efq. purporting 
an arbitrament between then Prior of Carlifle, and Chriftopher Brifco, then Lord of Crofton, 
that the faid Chriftopher Brifco and his anceftors were Lords of the manor of Brifco, but that he being 
taken prifoner by the Scots, and enforced to pay a great funi of money for his ranfona, was necelfitated, 
for the raifing of the fame, to mortgage his manor of Brifco to Prior of Carlifle.
And after- 
wards, they coming to an account about the lame, the arbitrators whom theychofetoadjuft their differences, 
ordered, that the prior and his fuccefibrs Ihould enjoy the whole manor, except the capital houfe and bed 
tenement, and that Chriftopher Brifco and.
his heirs ftiould have liberty to cut wood for building, and

:j; The vicar, by piefcription, is entitled to all the fmall tithes within the pailfh, and the great tithes 
of Micklethwalte, Paiton, Whinnow, and Nealhoufe ; but the year that the two firft pay the great tithe* 
in kind, the other two pay a prefcription, and fo alternately, — though there are fome exceptions.
The 
grounds in this parifli that belong to Diumleanny pay tithe in kind every year.
The tithe hay of 
Thurfby is held by leafe from the dean and chapter to the vicar, under the yearly rent of 30s.
There

; a two*penny fine 
due at change of tenant.
Extent.] Along the Wampool four miles and a half ; in breadth one mile.
Common Lands.] Here are about 300 acres of good common land : few flieep ate kept upon it } It 
is generally depaftured with young cattle and horfes.
— Cattle bred and fed here will weigh nine Hone per 
quarter upon an average.
Soil and Produce.] The weftern part of this parilh is of a light fandy or gravelly foil, with a fmall 
degree of loam, producing early crops of turnips, barley, oats, potatoes, and grafs.
The eaftern part is 
inclined to a clay, with a cold bottom, and much more backward ; more fultable to wheat than barley and 
turnips.
Agriculture.] Formerly this parilh produced much wheat ; but at prcfent the farmers fow turnips, 
then barley with grafs feeds, and fo lay it down for three years.
Fuel.] Coals from Bolton.
Game.] Hare, partridge, &c.
No diffenters in this parilh.
Rivers.] The Wampool bounds this parilh on the fouth ; a fmall rivulet, containing trout, eels, &c.
Along the Wampool, in this parlfh, is an extenllve fwamp, called Cardevi Mirei, where a great quantity 
of fine reeds grow, fold Into the diitant country, for the purpofe of ceiling rooms inftead of laths, being 
much cheaper.
Road.] The principal one from Carliile to Whitehaven.
Mineral.] No coals, llmellone, or frecftonc.
School.] A fmall one, not endowed.
Poor.] Annual expence about 60I.
collefted by the purvey.
Tithes.] Are paid herein a manner rather fingular: Thurfby pays corn and hay tithe regularly,— 
Micklethwaite and Parton pay a prefcriptive rent in lieu of tithe of hay, and pay tithe of corn one year, 
and a money or prefcriptive payment In lieu thereof the next year, and fo alternately — Whinnow and 
Nealhoufe the fame.
Tenure.] Both freehold and enftomary, by indenture, under different lords.
Aspect and General Appearance.] This parilh is fituated rather low, and in general Is level, 
the hedges good, the buildings in a middle degree, the crops tdx\j.——Croftoii Place, the feat of Sir John 
Brifeo, Bart.
Hands in the moll beautiful part of the parilh.
in an open fituatfon, lately improved, fo as to 
be an excellent houfe.
The family, by purchaling the whole village of Crofton, have been enabled to lay 
the grounds open, which has beautilied the fituation greatly.
The lands are remarkably fertile, particu- 
larly towards the river, where there is a deep ftrong loam, and perfectly level.
A conllderable mount, 
at a little diltance from the' houfe, planted with wood, Is a delightful objeft ; It lifes from a plain, of a 
conical form ; its vulgir name is ‘Torquin ; and the tradition relative to it Is, that two gigantic brothers 
lived In the foreft there.
Housman’s Notes.
We have the following accounts from our ingeiHous corrclpondent: — This parlfh derives its name from 
the god Ikcr.
- About -half a mile to the northwcfl of the cliurch, waj a temple dedicated to that god, 
the 
FOREST OF ENGLEWOOD.
463 
We have hitherto omitted to take notice of the great 
FOREST OF ENGLEWOOD, 
referving our remarks for this period.
The boundaries of the foreft, by a peram- 
bulation made in the 29th year of King Edward I.
by his commiflioners, and 
confirmed 
the place now called Woodrigs.
It is not twenty years ago fince the foundation of the building was dug 
up, and went by the name of Kirkfteads.
— A road was difeovered on the north fide, a little below the 
furface, leading eaft and weft, when the field was tilled, and fome traces have been feen in other adjacent 
fields.
The ftones that came out of the foundation of the temple were chiefly of the blue fort ; fcarce any 
freeftone.
The figure of the parlfli Is rather of a triangular form.
At a place called Nealhoufe-Bars, on the weft 
fide of Carlifle Moor, acrofs the public road between Carllflc and Wigton, bars were anciently put up.
Almoft every village in the northern parts of Cumberland have remains of thefe bars to this day.
They 
were ftrong upright oak pofts, and iron chains fixed Into them, which went acrofs the entrances into the 
villages, to fecure their cattle and other valuables in the night from the Mofs-Troopers.
Befides thefe 
bars, each village had a watchman ; and many a ftory is told of the conflidfs between the villagers and 
marauders.
Tire parilh is divided Into four quarters and three conftablewicks : one conftable ferves for Thurfbr, 
Moor-End, Eveninghill, How-End, Woodhoufe, Nealhoufc, and Nealhoufe-IIill, which are called 
Thurfby high and low quarters.
In the conftablewick of Crofton Is VVhInnow ; and In that of Parton 
are Mlcklethwalte, Whinns-Hill, and Newlands.
The church is dedicated to St. Andrew, and faid to be built by King David I.
The chancel part 
feems to be much older, and is a great deal higher, than the body of the church ; the materials are 
freeftone, and covered with red flate.
It has a fmall fteeple with two bells.
— The length of the body of 
the church Is 41 feet by 24 ; the chancel part is 38 feet by 17 in length.
Near the communion-table, 
within the rails, is a ftone bafon, 22 Inches long and 8 inches deep, of very rude workmanfhip.
It pro- 
jects three inches from the wah, and a fmall arch is formed over it ; this was for the ufe of the priefts in 
former times.
The edifice Is decent and commodious for the number of Inhabitants.
There is one burial 
place in the church, belonging to the family of Crofton Place, In which are two marble monuments ; one of 
them is very elegant, and was erefted by Sir John.
The columns are inlaid with variegated marble, with an 
urn on the top, cuiioufly Inlaid.
— There is a fmall library belonging to the church, which was a gift for 
the ufe of the vicar of Thurfby.
The living is a donative under the dean and chapter, and has annexed 
fevcral acres of glebe land.
The prefent Incumbent has built a comfortable vicarage-houfc from an heap 
of ruins, without having made a demand for dilapidations : it ftands on an eminence, and in a pleafant 
fituation.
The vicar is lord over two fmall parcels of ground.
— Here is no chapel of eafe, no diffenting 
meeting-houfe, or Romifh chapel.
— At Thurfby there is a fchool, in a flourilhing ftate, with nearly 50 
fcholars ; and there is another at Whinns.
The Income of the teachers arlfe from the quaiter-pence 
only.
The fpirit of hufbindry Is very prevalent here ; few parlflies in the county have made a more rapid 
progrefs cherein.
— There are only two perfons in the parifh licenced to fell i'pirituous liquors and ale.
The people in general are fober and Induftrious, many of whom are independent.
About a century ago, 
it is faid the Inhabitants of Thurfby in general were very poor ; only two people had any money to lend.
The intereft for the firft year was always well paid ; for the lenders’ ufual way was to take two fliillings 
from every pound at the time of lending.
One of the ufurers was a woman, who had a peculiar evaiion 
when perfons ihe did not approve came to borrow ; her anfwer was — “ Nay indeed thou cannot get it ; for, 
“ iftkoiill believe tbe vjord I /peak, I have nought aboon a fxpenee.” Her conftant method was (what- 
ever money fhe had) to lay one piece above another, with a fixpence at the top : — but now', by a proper 
application to agriculture and the mechanic arts, many are opulent, and it is at prefent in a very impro- 
ving ftate.
Here are no markets or fairs kept.

— The great road from Carlifle to Wigton and Cockermouth 
leads through the village.
Over the river Wainpool are three bridges ; two of which belong to the county.
There is a Angular piece of ground, which lies between the parilh of Dalfton and Thurlby, both 
parllhes have their refpeftive lhares, it is called Carde-vj Mire, but the original name was Carthieu, or God’s 
bog.
It was remarkably boggy within the memory of man ; the grafs which it produced was cut above 
the furface of the water, and fo dragged to fame fuitable adjoining ground to be made into hay.
The 
people formerly had great dragging ^ys ; but the ground is now drained, and become meadow land.-.
— 
There is a tradition, that an image of the god Thor Hood ou the Cartheiu fide of this morafs.
The air is generally clear and healthy ; a little fog will fometimes fpread itfelf along the low meadow 
ground, but fcldom reaches further.
Crofton quarter lies in the centre of the parilh, and includes Crofton Place, the feat of Sir John Brifeo,.
Bart.
— The deer-park contains between 140 and 150 acres, Inclofed with a wall near 8 feet in height., 
lb the park, a fifh-pend of 12 acres, flored with carp and tench.
— The woodlands, including the new 
plantations, are above 100 acres.
— The ordinary number of domeftics at this manfion is between 15.
and 20.
Sir John’s attention to building, planting, and agriculture, has beeit indefatigable ; within the laft 20 
years he has changed the face of the country : luxuriant crops of corn now grow where there was nothing 
but an entire morafs, or barren heath.
Many acres of fuch land are now in high cultivation.
I do not find that there has been any more than one author in this parifii his name is Studholme,.
BOW living at Moor-End, in the 85th year of his age.
He wrote a Moral Eflay, of which the Wellminfter 
Magazine for April, 1779, gives the following charaAer — “ The author propofes his fentimenti with 
“ modefty and perfpiculty.
A very Ingenious and philofophic piece : written both with intelligence and 
“ intelligibility ; nor Is there any thing aflunilng or dogmatical In any part of It.”

Within thefe extenfive limits arc included fcveral manors and townfliips^ men- 
tioned in the courfe of our work.
The late litigations occafioned feveral publi- 
cations, in which a few hiftorical fads are thrown out, touching this foreft, which, 
as they may not be deemed improper in this place, arc inferred in the notes.* — The 
general 
* It appears from thefe publications, that the Duke of Portland, being feized of the Honour of Penritht 
claimed this foreft as an appendage thereto — “ It appears from Matthew Paris and other cotemporary 
hiftorians, that, in the year 1257, the 21ft Henry III.
Alexander H.
King of Scotland, by a treaty 
“ at York, gave up all the fortified places poflefted by the Scots, In Cumberland, and the other northern 
“ counties ; and in lieu of them, Henr}' gave him and his heirs.
Kings of Scotland, eftates in the above 
counties to the amount of 200I.
per annum.
The Honour of Penrith was one of thofe eftates.
In 
“an inquifition taken at Carlifle, in the 21 ft of Edward I.
it Is called the manor of Penrith ; and 
“ Sowerby and the other parcels of land which aie now confidered as members of that honour, are there 
“ exprefsly mentioned as feparate and diftinft manors.
Alexander was bound by this treaty to pay a 
*' hawk every year to the conftable of Carlifle, as the condition on which Penrith and his other eftates 
“ were to be held.
“ Alexander III.
his fon, who married our Henry III.’s daughter, was in pofleffion of Penrith 1278 : 
“ for in that year he did homage to Edward I.
for his Englifli eftates ; and it is very remarkable, that 
“ Fordun, the Scotch hiftorian, fpeaking of this tranfaftion, mentions the lordjhip of Penrith as one of 
“ thofe eftates.
*• The Englifli eftates of the Kings of Scotland being forfeited in confequence of the wars between 
the two kingdoms, Penrith was next granted to John Duke of Brittany, anno 1378, in the 2d 
“ Richard II.
In this grant alfo it is called the tnanor of Penrith.
The manor of Sowerby was granted 
“ to this duke llkewlfe as a diftindl pofleffion, and is even named firft In the grant.
The Duke of 
“ Brittany had thefe two manors granted to him, for fo long time as the caftle of Breft fliould remain in 
the hands of the king, and until the fald caftle fliould be reftored to the fald duke.
It is probable 
“ therefore that he remained a very ftiort time in pofleffion of them, as hiftorians Inform us, that he left 
“ the Englifti alliance, and joined the French in 1380.
“ Penrith was again granted by the fame king, in the 21ft year of his reign, anno 1397, to Ralph 
** Neville, Earl of Weftmotland.
In this grant alfo it is called the manor and tonun of Penrith.
The 
“ manor and town of Sowerby is at the fame time granted to the earl, together with the hamlets of 
“ Langwathby, Scotby, and Carlton.
Gamelfby, which is now a member of Penrith, was not fo then ; 
“ for it appears from Dugdale, that John Neville died in pofleffion of it in the 12th of Richard II.
that 
“ is nine years before Penrith was granted by the crown to his brother Ralph.
“ Thefe eftates having fallen to the crown In the 38th year of Henry VI.
on the forfeiture and 
“ attainder of Richard Neville, Earl of Salifbury and Weftmorland, immediately after the battle of 
“ Wakefield, in 1459 ; in the fame year, the faid king gave to John Lord Clifford the cuftody of the 
“ caftle and manor of Penrith, and the ftewardflilps there.
“ Penrith being again forfeited to King Edward IV.
Immediately after the battle of Barnet, in 1471, 
“ this king granted it in the fame year to his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucefter, under this defcriptlon : 
“ The cajileand lordjhip of Penrith, (for it is not yet called an honour J <with itj members and appurtenances : 
“ and, in the fubfequent year, an aft of parliament paffed, by which the duke was enabled to hold, 
“ among other poffcfllons of the Neville family in other counties, Salkeld, Sowerby, Langwathby, 
“ Scotby, and Carlton, in Cumberland ; which fliews that they were not fuppoftd to have been granted 
“ before as comprized under the lordfhip of Penrith.
“ When Richard came to the throne, the manor of Penrith, and all his other great poffeflions, fell of 
“ courfe to the crown.
“ In the 14th of James I.
the honour of Penrith, (fo called for the firft time) nxiith its rights, members,

general tenor of periodical writings are feldom worth delivering down to after 
times ; as, on the one fide, it is too frequent to lee an infirm claim attempted to be 
maintained ; and on the other, little fpirit is to be difeovered, if diverted of thofe 
Parthian rtrokes which would infinuate a depreciation of the officers of govern- 
ment and men of high rank : tinged with the mort unhappy bias, that whatever 
proceeds from the foot of the throne murt be evil, corrupt, and full of injury ; 
a fpecics of calumny for which this age has been infamous, and which has the mort 
dangerous tendency : indeed we may greatly attribute to this degree of licentiouf- 
nefs a great fhare of the calamities which w e have furtained: it is a fpurious birth 
that has debafed the bed of Liberty.

till her death.
“ A few years before this queen’s death, in the 8th of King William, the faid honour of Penrith^ 
“ with the rents and premifTes deferibed in the faid grant ot King James I.
were granted in fee to 
“ William Earl of Portland, his heirs and afligns, for ever.” 
Among other arguments ufed in this publication, there Is the kaft perfpicuity and propriety in the 
“ following — “ The honour of Penrith and manor of Carlifle are parcels of property of a diftinft and 
** feveral nature, which could never be parts of each other.
It Is evident, that Penrith "vas criginally no 
“ part of ancletit demefne, the property of the cronun of England.
It is never lllled fuch In any of the.
“ grants ; and, though It was frequently in the hands of the crown, and again granted out of It, it aliuayr 
fell in by efvheat or forfeiture.
On the contrary, the manor of Carlifle is declared to be demefne of the.
crown, and is exprefsly faid in the grants to be part of the poflefGons of the ancient crown of England.” 
This writer had forgot two capital inftances which he had Hated — “ The original giant to Alexander 
“ King of Scotland, and the acceflion of King Richard III.
by which his eftates were annexed to the.
crown.” 
This writer ftates, that in the grant to the Duke of Portland’s anceftor, after the wmrds of grant of the.
honour of Penrith, with its members, are fpeclfically granted lands, tenements, and rents, within this, 
forell ; and from thence he argues, that, if the forefl; pafled, thefe lands, &c.
follow'ed of courfe, without 
any neceflary fpecification in the grant : he then goes on to fhevv feveral inftances, by records, where the 
grown exercifed jurifdi^lion in the foreft, whilft the manor of Penrith was out of the crown by grant.
— 
Thefe look fpecious to a fuperficial reader; but they are fadfs dlfmembered : an honour was a royal 
franchlfe, to which only a foreft could be an appendage.
It might comprehend many manors, which were 
even within the limits of the foreft, each manor a property in fome diftinft perfon : for the crown did,, 
In many inftances, grant out manors within the limits of the forefts, and parcels of land for the purpofe 
of cultivation.
— Penrith was evidently a manor, and had the diftinftion of an honour at the fame inftant : 
whilft,.
In the crowm.
It was attended with its concomitant rights of fejgniory over Inferior manors, 
its appendages of forefts, and other royal members of its franchife.
— When granted out as a manor, it 
pafled, /er limites et bundae, and had its manerlal rights immediately fevered from Its honorary privileges, 
w'hich were feparately vefted in the crown.
When It was granted out as an honour, all its royal franchife* 
pafled to the fubjedf ; and, though the foreft pafled therewith, the manors, lands, and rents therein,, 
eftabllfhed by time into feveral property, would not pafs without fpecification ; they had grown up into 
a feveral nature, and merely by grant of the foreft, would not have attended the foreft.
Thence we fee 
clearly the futile arguments of this writer.
— It Is a pity he could .find out no Inftances to amufe his 
readers with, w’herein the crown, during a unity of pofleftion, exercifed by fome leveral officer the jurif- 
didflon of the foreft Independent of the honour : that would have been ftriking an important line in his 
argument ; but, on the contrary, the inftances he gives of feveral adls were only In manerlal rights; and 
in fuch Penrith and the foreft could never be In union.
— The Swainmote court had no jurifdidf ion of the 
manerlal rights of Penrith, &c.
— The verdurers were proper in the foreft cnly But thus much mult

THE PARISH OF WIGTON, 
(IN CUMBERLAND WARD.) 
T he town of Wigton, feated in a naofl beautiful and healthy part of Cumber- 
land, Rands on a gravelly foil and fouthern afpedl, about an equal diftance 
from the mountains, and furrounded with rich cultivated lands.
“ Wigton was antient demefne of Allerdale, until Waldew, the fon of Earl 
“ Gofpatrick gave that barony unto Odard de Logis.
It contained Wigton, 
“ VV’^averton, Blencogo, Dundraw, and Kirkbride, with their appurtenances, which 
“ five townfhips are feveral manors w'iihin themfelves, known by metes and 
“ bounds, and lie within the barony of Wigton.
“ Odardus built Wigton church, and endowed the fame.
He lived unto King 
John’s time.
King Henry I.
confirmed Waldew ’s grant of the barony to him, 
“ by which it appeareth probable that he lived about an hundred years.
The Earl 
“ Randolph Mefchines gave Stanton to him, and King Henry I.
gave him Bleckhill 
“ and Melmarby.
He had ifllie Adam; Adam had iffue Odard, the lord; whofc 
“ fon and heir, Adam the fecond, died without iffue ; therefore the inheritance came 
“ to his brother Walter ; and had iffue Odard the third, who died without iffue, and 
“ Odard the fourth likewife.
Wherefore the brother John de Wigton, the fon of 
“ Walter, entered and had iffue a foie daughter and heir, Margaret, who, A.
D. 
” granted the church of Wigton to the abbot and convent of Holm Cultram, 
“ which they prefently did appropriate to their houfc, in the year of grace, 1334.
“ In King Edw'ard lll.’s time, Margaret was married to Sir John Denham, Knr.
*' and was impleaded for her birthright, and her mother, Idionifa Louvet, the wife 
" of Sir John de Wigton, was for a time hindred of her dower : yet her ad verfaries 
did not prevail.
Wigton barony, Ihortly alter her death, came to Thomas 
" Lucy, the of that name.
Lord of Allerdale, and thereby in his right the 
" feigniory of Wigton was extinguiflied, and became part of the antient barony of 
“ Allerdale, though ir is yet taken and reputed as a manor of itfelf.
From the 
" I.ord Lucy, it thenceforth, as other lands, defeended to the Lucies and Earls of 
** Northumberland, as appears in the title of Allerdale; and the reft of Odard d'e 
“ Wigton’s lands to others, as appears in the titles.” DtNroN’s MS.
The town of Wigton has feveral handfome buildings ; but the market-place is 
greatly incommoded by the butchers’ fliambles.
It has a weekly market on 
Tuefday, to which there is a great refort ; and abundance of excellent provifions 
are expofed to fale.
Wigton has increafed greatly w ithin the laft twenty years, 
and is now fuppofed to contain about 1700 inhabitants.
No engines for fpinning flax have yet been introduced into Wigton; but the 
neighbourhood is diftinguifhed for fpinning by the common wheel the beft yarn 
in this county.
The manufa(ftories here w'orth notice, are hardings, bleached linens of a ftrong 
fabric, ftriped Hollands, checks, calicoes, and of late fuftains, conduced by Wo 
Crookdake, who began a check manufactory in 1748 ; Ifaac Pattinfon and Co* 
began:

began one in 1780; Daniel Hewfon began one in 1790; Thomas Bufliby began 
one in 179 r ; Jofeph Hodge began one in 1793 ; and Hebfon and Co. began to 
make fultains in 1795.
The number of weavers employed in the town is about 120; but the number 
in the adjacent villages, who get their work from here, cannot be afcertained.
The manufadlory of tow cloth, Ofnaburghs, and heavy bleached linens, were the 
goods formerly manufadtured in this neighbourhood for fale.
The making of 
fuch goods was a convenient winter employment for a village family, and com- 
menced with rearing their own flax, preparing it in all its ftages, till it was made 
into cloth, or fold in yarn to the Kendal and Lancafler manufadories.
Striped Hollands and checks, which are the principal manufadure at prefent 
in the northern parts of the county, originated with John and Jacob Hod^e, late 
of this town.
About the year 1755, the firft of thefe induftrious men im'proved 
his knowledge of the mechanical parts, by travelling into Lancafter, as a vifitor, 
•where this branch was exclufively enjoyed.
The making of cotton goods.
of the foregoing deferiptions commenced about 
the year 1785 ; and the increafe of this brancli of induftry has been fo rapid, as to 
endanger the extirpation of the old eftabliflied manufadories, being foonerVeady 
for the market, and affording better wages to the workmen.
— But what has con- 
tributed mod: to the population of this place of late, is a manufadory for printing 
calicoes, ertabliflied in 1790, at Spittle, about a quarter of a mile from this town, 
by Meffrs.
Bromwell and Irving, where about fixty w'orkmen are employed!
This is likely to become an important work, as their goods bear a high charader 
in the market, and the fituation excellent for extending the bufinefs.
The other 
public works of note are, a brewery, the property of Meffrs.
Robert and William 
Hodgfon; and a foap boilery, the property of Mr. Ifaac Wedmorland.* 
In the year 1788, was built a meeting-houfe for Prefbyterian dilfenters: it is 
generally attended by about an hundred people; of whom are fome confiderable 
families refident in the town.
— The villages and farm-houfes in this panfh arc 
fuppofed to contain upwards of two thoufand inhabitants.
— There is a great 
quantity of uncultivated common land in this parifh ; for the dividing and inclofing 
of which a bill was brought into parliament about ten years ago, with claufes to 
fubjed the propofed inclofures with the perpetual payment of tithes in kind to the 
lay redor, and one fhilling per acre to the lord of the manor (Lord Egremont) for 
ever: the bill was thrown out, accompanied by loool, expences, which fell upon 
the petitioners.
This circumffance adds to innumerable others of a like nature, 
to induce the commoner to look towards the -\gricultural Society for a general 
plan.
This parifh is fupplied with coal and lime from Bolton, about four miles 
diftant: a cartload of coals, containing four Carlifle bufhels, is fold at Wigton for 
2s.
9d.
Although there are circumffances which denote that coal might be found 
in the parifli, no fuccefsful attempt has hitherto been made.

About ten years ago almoft all the lands of the parifli were enfranchifed by the 
lord of the manor; but, before that period, there were tenant-rights, holden of the 
lord under an arbitrary fine on death of both lord and tenant.
Our correfpondent exprclTes it, that the contagion of luxury has penetrated into 
this parifli ; but, it is to be obferved, that the rage for fpirituous liquors is lefs 
than it was ten years ago: the peafantry arc better informed than formerly, and 
the love of liberty is increafing with the increale of morality.* 
There is an hofpital here, founded in 1725, for fix indigent widows of Proteftant 
bcneficed clergymen, epifcopally ordained, and incorporated by the name of the 
Governefs and Silters of the College of Matrons, or Hofpital of Chrifi:, in Wigton.

It is not a little to the credit of this place, that a very eminent man, and diftinguidicd writer in various 
departments of literature, laid the firll foundation of all his future fame at the free-fcliool here, being 
only a few months old when his father came to Wigton.
Dr. John Brown was the fon of the Rev.
Mr. Brown, a native of Dunfe, in Scotland, and a fingularly learned man ; who was many years vicar of 
this parirtr.
His family w'ere epifcopalians ; and he himfelf was ordained by one of the Scotch non- 
juring bifliops : yet exercifed his funflion, and held preferment, on this fide the Tweed, without any 
objeftions being made, as far as is known, either to his orders, or other qualifications.
In fo retired and 
obfeure a fituation, it was not likely his abilities fiiould be much diftinguilhed : he w’as contented to be a 
good parifh prleft, and a ftudious man.
The fon, however, who was neither an obfeure nor a negledfed 
fcholar, is known to have paid the greateil deference to his judgment, by conttantly fubmitting molt of his 
produftions to his father’s criticifm ; — and the compiler of thele (hort biographical notices well remembers 
once to have found the venerable old man (then perhaps near eighty) reading the Iliad in the original, 
with all the ardour and enthufiafm of a fcholar of tw'enty.
He alfo remembers to have delivered to the 
fon fome remarks, colledted by the father from the Greek poets, for the ufe of his “ Hifiory of the 
Rife and Progrefs of Poetry.” Under fuch a father, it was hardly poffible the fon ihould not be a 
good clafiical fcholar.
Dr. Brown was boin in 1715, at Rothbury, in Northumberland, where his father w’as then curate to 
Dr. John Thomlinfon.
After his fchool education was finilhed, at feventeen, chiefly under his father,

melancholy and gloomy; it had a tower with an awkward flone fpirc.
It has been 
obferved, that the Hones of which the old church was built w'ere brought from the 
Roman 
and at the public fchool at Wigton, on the recommendation of Dr. Thomllnfon, who had hiinfclf been 
of that college, he went to St, John’s, in Cambridge ; which he left, with great reputation, in 173J.
— 
In 1739, he returned to Cambridge to take his mailer’s degree ; when alfo he was admitted into prie'.l’s 
orders ; and made minor canon and lecturer df the cathedral church of Carlifle.
It was during this his 
life of retirement and quiet in the north, that he laid the plan of an epic poem, on the fuppofed defeent 
of Brutus, a Trojan, after the deilriidlion of Troy, into this ifland ; which was his favourite objedl of 
ftudy through life : and he applied to it at the period in queition, with fuch iutenfe eanieilnefs, that 
fome appearances of a derangement of ir.tellefl (which even then were but too manifeil) were attributed 
by his excellent father to his unremitting attention to Brutus.
In confequence of this, the poem, at the 
prefiing inftance of his father, was laid afide : and an apprehenfion that, if refumed, it might again 
have the fame alarming effedls, feems to have reitrained him hereafter, fiom finiflilng it.
Some con- 
fiderable fragments of this great work, It is believed, are ftill in being.
Through the intereft of Dr. Ofbaldillon, when advanced to the fee of Carlifie, the dean and chapter 
there gave Dr. Brown the living of Morland, in the county of Weftmorland ; having before made him 
one of their minor canons and a ledlurer in the cathedral : and the fame biihop foon after made him one 
of his chaplain?.
Long after this, the Earl of Hardwick, as a teftimony, it may be fuppofed, of bis 
approbation of the principles and compofition cf two fermons preached and printed during the rebellion 
In 1745, prefented him to the living of Great Hoikcfley, in Effex ; which, on fome difgtift, he afterwards 
refigned.
— At length, Bifhop Ofbaldiilon, who was his fteady friend through life, prefented him to the 
vicarage of St. Nicholas, in Newcaflle upon Tyne : and thefe, excepting that he was a chaplain in ordinaiy 
to the king, were all the perferments he ever obtained.
In 1765, he entered into a correfpondence with Dr. Damarefquc, a fcholar and gentleman of great 
eminence, then relident in Ruffia, on the fubjedl of a moll extenfive and noble plan of education for the 
mighty empire of Ruffia.
Dr. Biown’s communications were fo peculiarly intelligent and interclling, 
that, on his letter being fliewn to her imperial majefly, file was pleafed to fend him a melTage to the 
following effeft — “ That the emprefs was much pleafed with his letter; and that, as It contained many 
“ things which deferved attention, but were fuch as he could not well know at that diflance, whether 
“ they were fuitable to Ruffia ; and as fhe had a very favourable opinion of him, and wifhed to confer 
“ with him ; therefore It would be very agreeable to her, if he would come over to St. Peterfburgh as 
“ foon as conveniently might be, in order to confider farther of thofe matters.” 
This honourable meffiage the dodlor received with great pleafure ; and ardently fet himfelf to prepare 
for his journey : having received from the emprefs’s ambaffador in England £ 1 000 flerling, to defray the 
cxpences of his journey.
Meanwhile, he had the hard fortune to be violently attacked with a fevere fit 
of the gout and rheumatifm ; to both which cruel diflempers he had all his life been fubjedl.
This illnefs 
was alfo much aggravated by an extraordinary and almofl preternatural depreffion of fpirits.
Under fuch 
drcumftances, it was judged, by his friends and phyficlans, as little lefs than madnefs in him to undertake 
fo long a journey, at the latter end of the year, to fuch a climate as Ruffia.
By their advice and per- 
fuafions he laid afide his defign for the prefent ; but with a full purpofe of refuming it in the following 
fpring.
To a man of his fanguine temper, fuch a dif ippolntment could not be a fmall one.
It greatly- 
agitated his mind ; and this, concurring with his 111 flate of health, and accompanied perhaps with a 
recolleftion of the other failures that had happened to him in his expeftations and wifhes, was followed 
by a dejedlion of fpirits, which at length amounted to a confirmed melancholy madneff.
Under this fatal 
alienation of mind, he put a period to his own life with a razor, on the evening (and not the morning, 
as is Hated in the New Blographia Brittannica) of the 23d of September, 1766, in the fifty-firil year of 
his age.
Dr. Brown was undoubtedly a man of uncommon ingenuity : but his great talents were unfortunately 
tindlured with an undue degree of lelf-opinion.
Perhaps the bias of his mind to infanity will afiign the 
bell caufe, as well as form the bell excufe, for thefe little draw-backs from the large fum of his general 
merits.
His genius was extenfive ; for, befides his being an elegant profe writer in various kinds of 
<ompofition, he was alfo a poet, a mufician, and a painter.

which mark appears on (tones fcattered over many other buildings in the town ; 
and 
may be formed by one only of liis early produftions, the Effay on Satire, whioh breathes the very foul of 
Pope ; and is indeed fo little, if at all, inferior to Pope, that it always has been, and itill is, bound up 
(as a part of Pope’s works) with Pope, in Warburton’s edition.
The charafter there given of one of 
the moft diftinguilhed of all the Britilh bards, is drawn with exquifite lliill, force, and eloquence.
As 
another fpeci.Tien of his poetical talents, we beg leave to tranfcribc the following beautiful infcription, 
written during his retirement into the country, in May, 1758 ; feledded, not for its fupericr excellence, 
but becaufe there is good reafon to believe it was written at Wigton : — 
Ftnemqne tueri 
Naturamque fequi.
What though no glittering turret rife, 
Nor fplendour gild thele mild retreats !
Yet Nature here, in modeft guife, 
Difplays her unambitious fweets ; 
Along each gently fwelling lawn 
She ftrays, with ruilic garlands crown’d ; 
And wakes the flow’rs at early dawn, 
To fling their bofom’d fragrance round.
Here teach thy vot’ry, blamelefs guide, 
To trace thy ftep ferene and free ; 
To fhun the toilfome heights of pride, 
Through thefe calm fcenes to follow thee.
His filent walks do thou adorn.
O’er thefe green Hopes, from tumults far ; 
Whether he greet the blufhing morn, 
Or welcome up yon ev’ning liar.
Intent while through thefe tufted bower* 
Thy generous whifpers charm his ear.
To hail from heaven thy kindred pow’rs.
And meet fair Peace and Freedom here.
Yet prompt to ftay his country’s fall.
The llormy city’s war he’ll join ; 
When thou, and Truth, and Freedom call: 
For Freedom’s voice and Truth’s are thine.
That he was no ordinary proficient in mufrc appears from Mr. Charles Avifon’s “ EJfay on Muftcal 
“ Exprcfion,” a well-received book, in the compofitron of which, it has been fald.
Dr. Brown had a 
principal hand.
He was allowed to be one of the bell gentleman performers on the violin, of his age.
— 
Thofe who have feen the pidtures of his father and mother, painted in crayons by him, allow, that 
they have great merit : and if that portrait of htmfelf, which is now in the vicarage houfe of Wigton, 
w'as alfo painted by him, as fome have thought it was, it clearly evinces the hand of a mailer.
The 
features are exadl, dark and faturnine ; but the eyes are animated with much penetration and fire.
To have excelled in three of the fine arts, which have fometimes been thought beyond the grafp of any 
«ne mind, however vigorous, proves him to have pofTeffed extraordinary powers.
The poet Thomfon 
Is fald once to have attempted to paint — as Pope alfo did — and to have failed ; for which a lingularly 
haodfome apology was made, in the following well-turned epigi-am ; —

We trull, it will not be made a matter of objeftion to onr work, that, in our fearch after Biographical 
materials, our attention has but feldom been arreiled by high-founding names, diftinguilhed by the pride 
of anceftry ; and that we have much oftener been led into the retreats of the humbled penury ; into the 
fhop of the avtifan, or the cottage of the pauper.
We are not infenfible to the value of blood ; nor are 
we in the number of thofe who, with a vulgar plebeian infolencc, foolifhly try to vilify rank and ftation, 
for no better rcafon, perhaps, than that blood and rank are out of their reach.
We honour high birth : 
it is of itfelf refpe£lable, and entitled to deference ; but when men nobly born bave been equally fortunate 
and equally careful to do honour to their high defeent, by a correfponding dignity of condudl, and by the 
performance of great and good adlions, our refpedl and veneration for them know little bounds.
It is not our fault, that thefe our biographical flcetches have been fo feldom adorned and fet 
off by the brilliant memoirs of men of great families ; had we found many fuch, it would have been our 
pride to have recorded them, with the fame diligence, and not lefs pleafute, as we have recorded their 
genealogies.
But, it is not to be denied, nor needs it to be concealed, that our country is not the moft 
opulent ; and, to add to our misfortune, it has not latterly been the fafliion with thofe few great men, 
who pofftfs confidcrablc eftates in our county, to refide in it.
We can work only with fuch materials as we find.
It may perhaps be peculiar to an Hlftory of 
Cumberland, that its biography is filled, chiefly, with accounts of low and poor peifons ; and, in a Hill 
more particular manner, with accounts of obfeure village fchoolmafters.
It has often ftruck us forcibly, 
in colle£ling and compiling thefe humble memoirs, and we think it can hardly fall to make a fimilar im- 
pieflion on all thofe readers who do us the honour to perufe our pages with attention, that a majority of 
the perfons here recorded, have, in early life, been fchoolmafters r but fchoolmafters on the loweft fcale.
That we either have more lnftru6lors of children, or that our people are more generally or better taught, 
than in other counties, we feem to have no good authority to affert : but we think we are warranted In 
the obfervation, that no where have fo many refpeftable men been employed as teachers, as we can 
enumerate in this county ; nc r (as we cannot but add, though It be with forrow and ftiame) fo ill paid.
If the notice here taken of this highly meritorious clafs of citizens, may but have the effedl of procuring 
them fomewhat more of refpecl and reward, we fhall be happy ; from a thorough conviftion, that our- 
county will thereby be materially benefited.
Thefe refledllons naturally occurred to us, as we were reviewing the memoradums we have made, to 
enable us to give fome account of a man of very great merit In a low fphere of life ; Joseph Rook, a 
native of this parifh.
He was born where he now lives, at Alk-Bank : and after being barely taught to 
read and write a little, he was bound apprentice to a weaver ; and ferved his apprenticelhip faithfully ; 
and worked at his trade, feveral years, even after he became a married man.
With all our partiality in 
favour of this truly extraordinary man (with whom we are proud to fay we have the honour of a perfonal 
acquaintance) we do not think him entitled to the charaiiler of a man of great genius.
He may have, 
and we think he has, fomething that Is much better ; but he has not appeared to us to poffefs that 
inftantaneous, intuitive, penetration, by which men of genius feem to come at Information and knowledge, 
without fubmrtting to the flow and fcmetlmes iikfome procefs of logical deduftion and Inference.
The 
forte of our friend Jofeph Rook’s charadler, feems to lie in his pofleffing a clear and vigorous under- 
ftanding ; and in being capable of inteufe thought.
His fedentary ftation at his loom was not unfavourable 
to this turn of mind.
He read a little ; and thought much.
It Is our opinion (an opinion, which wc 
believe to be well-founded, hecaufe It has not been haftil'y adopted) that this Is, in no ordinary degree, 
the general charafteiiftlc of the natives of this county.
The thing does not admit of demonftration ; but, 
we are confident, if a comparifon could be made with any other county, Cumberland would be found 
diftinguifhable for producing men, who, in all occupations and all ftations, think much on deep fubjeils, 
and chiefly, if not only, on deep fubjefts.
When they read, they read the feriptures and controverfial 
theology ; the law ; mathematics and natural philofophy.
On fome of thefe Jofeph Rook was perpetually 
ruminating.
At length, being favoured with an unlooked-for opportunity of attending a courfe of 
ledlures given at Wigton by Mr. Banks, Jofeph became an acknowledged mathematician and phllofopher.
And now too he fet up as a fchoolmafter ; an employment not lefs laborious, nor more profitable, than that

Gothic churches.
In the year 178S, a new and elegant church was built.
On the 
facia of the north front of the old church, alinoft covered with grafs, we difeovered 
a fculptui c on a Hone about eighteen inches long, in relief, like the figure of a 
Victory, or one of the Genii ; but it lay fidewife, and fo buried in foil and filled 
with 
which he relinquifhed.
But it feemed to gratify his ruling paflion ; as it had at leaft the femblance of a 
literaiy employment.
He Is ftill a fchoolmafter ; ftill at Aik-Bank ; flill modeft and unaffuming ; cca- 
tciitcd and chearful ; ambitious only to difeover fo7net.hmg 7ienv, and to enlarge the bounds of his 
knowledge.
He underftands optics more than tolerably: has made fevcral microfeopes of glaffes of his own grinding: 
the objeft glaflcs only forjiis telefcopes he gets from London.
He has alfo made metallic mirrors, and 
a prifin : and one large reflefting telefcope.
Being a mufician, as well as a philofopher and mechanic, 
he plays on the violin, and ftringed inftruments ; tunes harpfichords, has made a dulcimer, and a puppet, 
which moves, when the firings beat ; and has alfo built himfelf an organ.
He alfo has, all of his own 
conftrudling, an eledlrlfylng machine, a pair of globes mounted on wooden frames, a mariner’s compafs, 
and a theodolite, fo conflrudled as, by a very ingenious contrivance, to meafure the inequalities of the 
fuiface.
And, before he had ever feen any fuch projedlion in any book, globe, or planifphere, he laid 
down, with tokrable exadlnefs, the liars on a planifphere ; very much in the manner that Fergufon had 
jull before hit on.
He afeertained the dillances, by holding a firing, or fmall thread, at arm’s length: 
and thus was really as original a difeoverer of that plan, as Fergufon himfelf, or any other aflronomer.— .
With the turner’s lathe he is quite expert ; and has a contrivance for the turning of ferew's, different from, 
and fuperior to, thofe in common pradlice.
In time, he became fomething like a regular fludent ; and 
having procured the fecond edition of the Edinburgh Encyclopoedia, In ten volumes, he foon got a 
competent acquaintance with the whole circle of the fciences.
With logarithms, algebra, fluxions, 
geometry, trigonometry, navigation and furveying, he has more than a fupeificial acquaintance : indeed, 
his greatcfl and mofl profitable employment at prefent, is land-meafuring.
Flis plans are uncommonly 
neat.
In botany his fleill is conflderable t though, from a natural diffidence, and a lack of words, and 
particularly from his being unacquainted with the learned languages, he expreffes himfelf but awkwardly, 
and of courfe feems to know Icfs than he really does.
His drawings are done in a flile far above 
mediocrity : and fo are thofe of one of his fons.
His countryman Sowei'by, the firfl in the kingdom, 
we believe of merit In this line, needs not blufh to own Jofeph Rook as a brother artifl.
What a pity it is, fo clear-headed, fo fteady, fo judicious, fo ingenious, fo good a man had not the 
good fortune to find employment in foinc of the large manufacluring houfes in Lancafliire !
It may now 
perhaps be too late ; as he Is now forty years of age ; and has twa fons, both of them promifing lads, 
growing up fafl towards manhood.
But Jofeph is contented and happy ; and 
“ Paffiug rich with Icfs than forty pounds a year.”

There Is a delicacy and a difficulty in fpcaking of living authors, which hath generally deterred biographers 
from attempting it : tliis is a tafle from which even Dr. Johtifon fhrunk.
It would be faflldious, how-

Encouraged by thefe confideratlons, we wifh to mention Mr. Ewax Clark, a gentleman of a good

Extent.
3 From N.
to S.
4 miles ; in breadth about 3 miles.
Common Lands.] There appears to be more common than inclof^d land in this parifli; all of art 
improvable nature, of a fine dry fward, but unlevel.
The inclofurcs are laid out in very irregular forms, 
and are inteifefttd and Indented by the commons.
— The (heep kept on the commons are fmall, and killed 
young, as they are very fubjeft to the rot.
Many have died within late years ; fo that it is difficult to 
calculate the number with any degree of certainty ; but prcfume they arc between 2 and 3000 yearly, 
on an average.
1 he proprietors have of late years bought and bred a great many Scotch galloways to 
go upon the common.
Soil and Produce.] The foil varies in dlifercnt parts ; fome loam, clay, and gravel; but all of it 
dry and fertile, producing every kind of grain, turnips, potatoes, and grafs, in a good degree.
Rents.] Near the town land lets for 3I.
an acre ; in farms, about il.
is.
an acre on an average.
Fuel.] Coals, peat and turf.
Coals from Bolton, which fell at Wigton for 2 ».
6d.
the fingle horfc 
cartload, about 12 Carhfle pecks : the others are got in the pariffi.
Quarries.] Plenty of red freeftone ; but no limeflone or coal.
Springs.] A fpiing called Hally-Well, which comes off iron ore.
Lake.] Called the Martin-Tarn, about 2 fquaie furlongs In dimenfion, fituated on the commoii 
north of the town : contains pike, perch, and eels.
Roads and Rivers.] The Wampool and the Waver touch thisparlfh; the one on the eaft and the 
other on the weft fide.
— The principal roads are thofc from Carlifle to Whitehaven, Allonby, Abbey 
Holm, &c.
Endowments.] The hofpital, as before mentioned at large.
— The fchool, alfo before noted.
— About 
a year ago, one Mr. Alllfon left icool.
to be paid upon the death of an old woman, for the ufe of a free*’ 
fchool.
Spaw.] Near Kirkland is a fpaw well : the water not having.
been analyzed, Its virtues not defcribed: 
it is drank with phyfic.
Antiquities.] Two years ago, on the fkirts of this pariffi, towards Old Carlifle, 5 urns, containing 
bones, affies, &c.
were found in the gravel, about 3 feet below the furface.
Remarkable Incidents.] Warkup, one of the incumbents of Wigton, whofe epitaph is before 
noted, in the civil war was obliged to fly on account of his loyalty to the fovereign.
After the reftora- 
tion he returned to his cure ; and the tradition is, that the butcher market was then held’ upon the 
Sunday, and the butchers hung up their carcaffes even at the church door, to at; raft the notice of their 
cuftomers as they went in and came out of church ; and it was not unfrequent to fee people, who had 
made their bargains before prayer began, to hang their joints of meat over the backs of the feats until 
the pious clergyman had finiffied the fervice.
The zealous prieft, after having long, but ineffeftualiy, 
endeavoured to make his congregation fenfible of the indecency of fuch praftices, undertook a journey to 
London on foot, for the purpofe of petitioning the king to have the market-day eftabliflred on the 
I'uefday, and which it is faid he had Intereft enough to obtain.
Aspect and .General Appearance.] This pariffi in general lies low, and has no general inclina- 
tion : it contains little of level land, and yet in no part can be called hilly.
— The lands have originally 
been laid out and cultivated, without any attention to regularity, and when land has been of little value; 
for the out-fences are moftly crooked, inclofing thofe parts which were thought be ft, and eafieil cultiva- 
ted.
Great part of the commons, if inclofed, would prove fertile, and reward the labours of the 
huffiandman.
— Here is little wood.
— The buildings in general are good; fome few clay honfes arc 
fcattered upon the fkirts of the pariffi Housman’s Notes.

The town of Wigton did not efcape the depredations of warfare ; for, in the 
14th century, it was reduced to alhes, at the time the Scots wafted the monafterjr 
of Holm Cultram.
THE PARISH OF AIKTON, 
(IN CUMBERLAND WARD.) 
** A IKTON, villa quercum^ is a manor, town, and parifti in the barony of Bui^h 
** XjL upon the Sands, and the principal feat of Johan de Morvill, thefecond 
daughter and one of the two coheirs of Sir Hugh Morvill, Lord ot Burgh.
A little 
“ hamlet there (now called Doivnhally and ever fo named after the-Sco s burnt it) 
“ was the capital mefluage of Aikton, where the faicl Johan Morvill and her 
hulband, Sir Richard Gernon, (or Gernn, or Wernn) dwelt; and after them 
another Richard Gernon, and Helewife his wife ; he the kinfman of the elder 
Richard, and fhe the daughter to John Morvill, to whom Johan gave fix caru- 
cates of land, for their maintenance, in frank marriage.
Johan died the 31ft: 
** year of King Henry III.
and Helewife her daughter 34th King Henry III.
By 
“ her death, the land fell to Ada, her fifter and heir, lace wife to Radulph Boyvill 
** de Levington, and then wife to William Lord Furnival.
The fame Ada died 
55th King Henry III.
And after Ada, her daughter and heir, Hewifa, the late 
wife of Euftice Balliol, fucceeded in the inheritance of Ada, and of Radulph 
Levington, the firft hufband; which Hewifa died 55th King Henry 111 .
without 
“ ilTue : therefore the lands of R.adulph Boyvill, of Levington, fell to his fix fifters 
and coheirs ; and Hewifa’s 4th part, viz.
the moiety of her grandmother’s 
“ moiety of the Morvills’ lands in Burgh and Kirkofwald, to Thomas de Multon 
“ de Gilfland ; and the manor of Aikton and the other 4th part of Burgh barony 
“ to Roger, fon of Walter Colvill, and Margaret his wife, as the right of Margaret 
aforefaid, by defeenr, as fome think, from Hewife; but it feems otherwife, 
“ for the lands are found to be holden of the Lords of Burgh afterwards, and not 
" of the king immediately.
After Roger, fucceeded Edward Colvill, his fon and 
heir, 14th King Edward 1 .
Lord of Aikton.
His mother Margaret died 9th 
** King Edward HI.
and then Robert Colvill, fon and kinfman to Roger, was 
** found heir.
In the 23d King Edward III.
Thomas Daniel died lord of the 
fame, and the other lands in Burgh, in the right of Ifabel his wife, the heir of 
“ Colvill, and left his daughter Margaret, a child of three years of age, his heir ; , 
“ w'ho, in the 40th year of King Edward III.
intailed the land to the heirs male 
“ of John RatcIifFe her hufband, and hers ; rhe remainder to Richard their fon for 
*' life; after to heirs male of Robert, Thomas, Richard, and John, fons of the 
** faid Richard, fucceftively ; after to the heirs male of John, the fon of Catharine 
de Cliftley; after to the heirs male of John, the fon of William Ratcliffe, of 
Longfield ; after to the heirs male of Robert, the fon of William, the fon of 
Richard Ratcliffe; and after to the right heirs of Margaret Daniel, the grand-

“ continue at this day, and fo are become demefnes of the Lord Paramount of 
Burgh, united to the antient feigniory, from whence they were divided by the 
“ partition of Sir Hugh Morvill’s daughter fas is before mentioned) in the time 
“of King John.
The parifli contains Gamellby, Biglands, Wigganby, Whitrig- 
“ lees, Drumleyning, Lathes, and Wampool.” Denton’s MS.
Gamelsbv, within this parifli, is on the north of Wampool river: it, together 
with Biglands, an adjoining hamlet, were anciently a manor of the barony of 
Burgh; being granted out to one Breuer by fome of the ancient barons.
By 
female iffue, it was divided into moieties; one of which was fold to the tenants; 
and the other was purchafed by Lord Dacre, and re-united to the barony.
Wathampool was another inferior manor, and the ancient polTelTion of the 
Bruns, whofe fuccelTors took the local name of Wathampole.
It afterwards came 
to the Warwicks, who fold it out to the tenants, now holding their lands, as free- 
holders, of the barony of Burgh.
Laithes is the third divifion of this parilh.
It was part of the demefne of 
Whitrigg, and was pofleffed by the family of Laithes from near the time of the 
conqued to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when Adam de Laithes fold the lands

Kirkbride is in extent, from north to fouth, about a mile and a half, and is nearly of the fame breadth.
Common Land.] About one half of this parifh is wafte, or common, much of which is of mofs- 
carth, covered with heather : — a few iheep and young cattle arc kept upon it, where they find a meagre 
pafturage.
Soil and Produce.] The foil varies, but is in general either a mofs-earth, or clay.
— It produces 
grain of all forts ; barley and oats the beft.
— The inclofed lands pretty good grafs land.
Rivers ] The Wampool bounds the eaft fide of the parifli, and falls into the Solway Frith.
This 
river runs very dead, on account of the iowr.efs of the bed ; and what with the tide flowing up it, and 
frefii water floods, it is often fo fwelled as to alter the fands in its courfc fo much, that no bridge hitherto 
«refted has flood, and the fording of it confequcntly is uncertain and dangerous.

in this parilh.
Fuel ] Chiefly peats and turf.
Mi NERALS ] No coals, limeftonc, nor freeftone.
Tithes.] Corn hay, &c.

Camden fays — " There jets out a fmall promontory, below which is a large arm 
“ of the fea, the boundary at prefent of England and Scotland ; but formerly of 
“ the Roman province and the PiCls. Upon this little promontory is that old • 
" tnw'n, Blaium Bul^ium, (pofTibly from the Britilh hulch, fignifying a partition or ' 
“ divorce) from which, as the place mofl: remote, and the limit of the province 
“ of Britain, Antoninus begins his Itinerary.
The inhabitants at this day call it 
“ Bulnefs ; and though it is but a very fmall village, yet has it a fort; and (as a 
“ tedimony of its antiquity) befides the tracks of Itreets and pieces of old walls, 
“ it has a harbour, now choaked up; and they tell you a paved caufey ran along 
“ the fhore, from hence as far as Ellenborough.
(Here are alfo frequently found 
Roman coins and inferiptions, and not long fince was dug up a fmall brazen 
“ figure of a Mercury, or a Vidfory, which came into the polTelfion of John 
“ Aglionby, Efq.) A mile beyond this, as appears by tlie foundations at low water, 
“ begins the Pidls wall, that famous work of the Romans, which was formerly the 
” boundary of the province, and was built to keep out the barbarians, who, in thofe 
“ parts, were, as one expreiTes it, continually barking and fnarling at the Roman 
" empire.
I was amazed at firlf, why they (hould be fo careful to fortify this 
“ place, when it is fenced by a vafi: arm of the fea, which comes up feme eight 
“ miles; but now 1 underfiand that, at low water, it is fo (hallow, that the robbers 
“ and plunderers made nothing of fording it.
That the figure of the coaft here- 
“ abouts has been altered, appears plainly from the roots of trees, covered over with 
fand, at a good diftance from the fliore, which are often difeovered when the tide 
“ is driven back by ftrong winds.
I know not whether it be worth while to 
“ obferve, what the inhabitants tell you of fubterraneous trees without boughs, 
there are feveral good hrirlc houfes.
The reftory houfe was lately built by the prefent reftor, Mr.
Metcalfe, who has the advowfon.
This manfion is intended to be finiihed in a very elegant ftyle ; the 
frtuation is particularly beautiful; the ground there rifes a little, and commands an extenfive view over 
a level country on every fide ; in fome diredtions, and particulary towards Holm Cultram, the plain has 
the appearance of being covered with wood, from the hedges running parallel, and croffing the fight at 
right angles.
Towards the north-weft, Solway Frith appears ; over which the Scotch hills are feen 
diftinftly, with their variegated and cultivated fleirts : on the other hand Skiddaw and the adjacent 
mountains prefent themfelves to the view.
The want of tr-ees near this houfe is the moft to be lamented; 
but which the tafte of the owner, and fome few years, will, doubtlefs, fupply.— Housm an’s Notes.

Upon the fame frith, a little more inward, 
is Drumbugh Cattle, of late days ( 1607) the poffeflion of the Lords Dacres, and 
** at prefent (1695) the Lord Vifeount Lonfdale, but formerly a Ration of the 
Romans.
Some will have it to bef the Caflra Exploratorum, but the diftance 
will by no means allow of it.
Here are many Roman monuments which were 
collected by John Aglionby, Efq.”|) 
By the courfe of the Roman wall, the diftance between Burgh and Drumbugh 
exceeds four meafured miles a little.
The wall being in this whole tracfl much 
defaced, it is not to be expected that the places of the caftella can be afeertained.
According to the rule adopted for calculating their diftances, there would be five 
caRella between thefe two Rations, one of which would neccRarily Rand near to 
Drumbugh.
We muR obferve, that Drumbugh feems to have been added to the 
work, from fonve occafion that had Riew'ed it would be neceflary to guard the 
inarRi with more force than the ordinary chain of cajlella.
According to the Notitia 
and fcale of Rations ad lincam valli, laid down by Mr. Horfley and Mr. Warburton, 
it was the feventeenth in number, and was called Gabrofentuniy where the cohors 
fecunda 'dhracum was Rationed.
Mr. Horfley’s words are — “ The cohors Jecunda 
“ Thractm feems to have been in Cumberland, by an infeription found at Ellen- 
“ borough, and fo might probably, in the latter times of the empire, be fixed at 
Drumbugh.
— I know' Gabrojentum has generally been taken for Gatcfliead, near 
NewcaRle, ever fince Camden imagined it to be there ; but w ithout reafon ; for, 
as there was a Ration at NewcaRle, on the north fide of the river, it is not eafy 
to fuppofe, that there would be another juR on the foulh fide of Gatefliead.
At 
Drumbugh is a fort about five chains fquare, whole ramparts are large, and ditch 
very deep : out of this fort abundance of Rones have been taken.
It is very 
probable, that the houfe and garden walls have been built W’ith the Rones of the 
wall and Ration, and that it has the name of caRle from the old Roman fort ; for 
“ the feat is not built in the from of a caRle. There feemed to be fomewhat like 
a ditch to the fouth of the houfe, which I fufpeded might be Hadrian’s; but 
f Dr. Gale, p.
36, makes thele the fame with Blatum Bulgiurn.
II Sime time ago, the following particulars were communicated to the Cumberland Pacquet— 
i'here was lately dug up at Bownefs, in Cumberland, very near the weftern extremity of the PiA« 
wall, and the mod weftern ftation thereon, a red freeftone, about 3 feet long, 1 6 inches broad, and 
“ 2 inches and a half in thicknefs, with the Infeription following, in Roman capitals —

this I dare not depend on.
I am much of opinion, that Severus’s wall may here 
too have fallen in with the north fide of the fiation.
As for the altars and 
inferiptions that are here, it is generally faid that they were brought from another 
place; and it is certain, from Camden, that the two curious inferiptions, which 
“ yet remain at this place, and are legible, did not originally belong to it.
— 
“ Whether any other altars which are here, and whofe inferiptions are defaced, 
may have at firft been found here, I cannot determine.” 
All our antiquaries have agreed, that it was neceffary to have a fiation at each end 
of the march ; which, if the tide advanced to the height many of the inhabitants 
infifi it has done, by the wreck they find whenever they cut the lurface of the 
foil, there would be found a bay, which would be properly guarded by the two 
fiations of Burgh and Drumbugh.
In the whole courfe of the village of Burgh, 
no traces are difcovcrable of the Roman works, though the inhabitants, from the 
difeoveries they frequently make of materials and mafon work, infifi, that the wall 
of Severus palled on the north fide of the town.
If was Mr. Horfley’s opinion 
that a cafiellum had fiood about a quarter of a mile wefi of Burgh, from the 
extraordinary quantity of materials which had been gained from thence ; the place 
is called lValcb~Hill to this day; and, in his time, a remarkable tree in it was called 
the IVatch-Tree.
Mr. Horfley fays he was told that the people frequently firuck 
upon a pavement hereabouts, not far from the track of the wall, and that the fiones 
they found there were fuch as are now ufed for paving : this he thought was the 
military way, fince it feemed to have been between the two walls; “ for, as 
** Severus’s wall feems to have run nearly parallel to the highway from Burgh 
“ wefiward, and to the north of the way, fo from Burgh to Dykesfield there is a 
*' ditch, very vifible to the fouth of Severus’s wall, at firfi five chains, and at the 
“ end of the village Longburgh, about ten from it, which, therefore, mufi have 
belonged to Hadrian’s vallum.
“ VV'hether Hadrian’s work has been continued any further than this marfh, or 
“ to the water fide beyond Drumbugh, is doubtful ; but 1 am pretty confident it was 
“ not carried on fo far as the wall of Severus at this end, any more than at the other; 
" However it is certain, that, from the fide of the marfii to the wefi end of the 
“ wall, there is no appearance of Hadrian’s w'ork, or any thing belonging to it.” 
It was a prevailing opinion with our antiquaries, that Hadrian’s work, on the 
caft end of the wall, did not extend fo far as the works of Severus, till the difcovery 
of an infeription, communicated by Mr. Harrifon, now of Durham, to Mr, 
Pennant, who publilfied it in his Tour of Scotland, and which was quoted from 
thence in the l^iew of Northumberland : this difcovery firengthens Mr. Gordon’s 
pofition, that the works had united before their termination at the two extremes; 
and we think it probable fome future difcovery may afeertain it on the wefi point.
“ From Burgh to Drumbugh Cafile, no vefiige of the wall is to be feen, though 
“ 1 think it certain, that the wall did not pafs through the tr.arfh, but by Boufiead- 
“ Hill and Eafion ; for both tradition and matter of fat;:t favour this courfe of it.
“ The country people often firike upon the wall, and could tell exadtly feveral 
" places thiough which, by this means, they knew it pafled, and always by the 
" fide of the marfii : befides it is no way reafonable to fuppofe, that the Romans

would build their wall w ithin tide mark ; and it is evident that the w-ateir 
has formerly overflowed all this marfh.
The Solway Frith has reached much 
higher, both fouthward and northward, than it does now ; and in very high 
*• tides it has been known, even within memory, to come a great way.’^ 
Severus’s wall and ditch are both very conipicuous at a fmall diftance from 
Drumbugh, to the w'efl:, and continue the greatell part of the way to Bownefs.— 
Mr. Horfley fays — “ On the eaft part of Boulnefs the wall meafured ten feet in 
” height, though the facing ftones were removed.” We do not difcover the place 
where the remains were of that loftinefs, though in feveral parts the work is many 
feet above the common level.
Hadrian’s work is quite effaced.
It was the 
opinion of Mr. Horfley and Mr. Warburton, that thefe works went beyond 
Drumbugh, and down to Solway Frith; and that this may have been one reafon 
why Severus’s wall has formed fuch an angle in its way to Bownefs.
At about the diflance of fourteen furlongs from Bownefs, there are the vifible 
remains of a caftellum, which falls in its due place on the adopted computation of 
diftances; and there muft have been another between that caftellum and the 
Ration.
The diftance betw^een Drumbugh and Bownefs is near three miles and a 
half; fo that the flation takes up the place of a caftellum; and the regularity of 
the work fhews, that at this Ration the wall began.
BOWNESS 
was the Tiinnocellum of the Romans, being the eighteenth Ration on the wall, 
where, according to the Notitia, the cohors prima yElia Clafficu was placed.
The fituation of this Ration is exceedingly proper, on a natural elevation, the 
promontory being rocky, and commanding the fliore.
The village now occupies 
the fite of the flation, yet hath not effaced the marks of the vallum and out-works.
To the weR of the village, we could perceive no remains of a continuation of the 
works; or gain any information or tradition of their appearance: fo that it is 
probable the account given by Camden had arofe from mifinformation.
Mr.
Warburton fays, “ but, upon enquiry into this matter, 1 could not Rnd any thing 
“ about it which could be relied on; and therefore am of opinion, that it had been 
the foundation of one of the fmall forts which w’ere placed along the fhore of 
“ the frith, that led him into this miflake.
When the tide is out, the river is 
** fordable here : 1 rode it in the evening I was there ; but was told that it could 
“ not be forded below ; fo that it is probable the wall has terminated in this 
« Ration.
“ From Burgh to the end of the w’all, we meet with no more original inferip- 
“ lions that belong to it, or any of the Rations upon it ; for though there are two 
** legible ones at Drumbugh CaRle; yet they belong not to the wall, as 1 fhall fhew 
« afterwards.
And it is moR likely that the other two altars, which are at the fame 
caftle, one in the hayloft, and the other in the fouth wall of the garden, (but no 
•* vifible letter upon them ) have both belonged to fome other Ration, moR probably 
«« Old Carlifle, from whence it is certain the others were taken.

As for Boulnefs, the lafl: 
Nation upon the wall, I could not fee or hear of any infcription remaining there.
That now at Appleby leems to have come from Boulnefs ; but is no original.
— 
“ However it is an argument, that fome Roman inferiptions, as well as other anti- 
“ quities, have formerly been found here; for Mr. Bainbrig had a humour of 
“ cutting out, or copying upon Bones, any Roman infcription which cam.e in his

t EXTRACT FROM THE MANUSCRIPTS OF ROGER GALE, ESQ^ 
Letter fro 7 n Sir John Clark, dated igth Aitgujl, 1739.
“ On Sunday we went along the fea fide to Alington, and fo came to Boulnefs, where I was obliged 
“ to flay, becaufe of the tide, till next morning about eleven.
Here the Roman wall began or ended.
“ Camden thinks it went a little further to the weft, into the fea ; which is very probable, if the frith 
“ at low water was as paffable then as it is now : but I have reafon to believe, that In the Roman times, 
“ the fea ran higher by feveral feet than at prefent ; this is manifeft on the coaft of Italy, and even in 
“ Scotlai d ; for, at a place called Crauiond, four miles above Leith, there was a Roman harbour, where 
" now the fea fcarce wafties.
“ The ftatlon at Boulnefs has been a large fquare, all fortified with ditches, faced with fquare ftones ; 
few ruins, except an old fquare vault, remain.
The wall of Severus is very confpicuous here for 
“ a mile or two, though fometimes levelled to the ground.
Nothing remains but the middle of the 
“ building, and indeed this appears, in fome places where I meafured it, 8, 9, and to feet high: the 
“ outfide and infide have been of fquared ftones.
Thoufands of cartloads remain, and at times the 
“ quantity Is vifiblc In all the houfts and inclofures hereabouts.
Nothing is to be feen half a mile from 
“ this wall, but fmall inclofures of two or three acres, fenced with thefe ftones.
I obferve, that the 
“ infide of the wrall is built Irregularly for the moft part.
The cement is a mixture of lime and fmall 
“ gravel, with fome ftiells beat together, and poured in with water from the top, till the interftices were 
“ filled up.
“ ITiis w-ay has been Imitated by myfelf and fome modern builders, with good effedt, and never fails 
“ to make ftrong walls.
The ftation of Boulnefs was, by Camden and others, thought to be the Blatum 
** Bulgium of the Roman Britalns, but Mr. Horfley will have it called Tunnocellufu ; and that Middleby, 
“ which you faw, is his Blatum Bidgiunu I cannot be of his opinion, there Is fuch an affinity between 
Blaf urn Bulgium and Boulnefs ; the additional fy liable nefs'’ being an old Britifti word fignifying a 
“ point or promontory near the fea ; fo we have in Scotland Invernefs, Bucannefs, and many others.
“ I find that Mr. Horfley has not had an opportunity to fee an altar which is built up In a houfe 
“ here, belonging to one Mr. Lawfon, with the following infcription, which I caufed the fchoolmafter

The ftone is eight inches and three-fourths wide, and fifteen inches and

“  Mr. Hoifley takes notice of a pillar found in your neighbourhood at Greta-Bridge, with an inferip- 
** tion to thefe two emperors, which he fays is the only one in Britain, (fee his book, p.
305) ; but here

“ 5 points, which poffibly were made to fignify what office or family this man was of, for they are by 
“ no means accidental.
“ Some days before I came to this place, there was another ftone found, about 10 inches fquare,” and 
which Is given at No. 22, among the Old Carlijle antiquities.
“ The reading of this is agreeable to other inferiptions of the fixth legion : “ Legio fexta vi£lrix pia 
“ f delis et felix fecit '' — Thefe were the honourable titles of this legion, and the ftone being of no great 
** weight, I gave my landlord a fhilling for It, who had It in Ills dyke, and took it away with me.
But 
“ before I leave it, I cannot omit one remarkable thing, which my landlord, being a mafon by trade, 
“ affured me of, and that Is, that there is no ftone within fix miles of this place of the quality of which 
“ Severus’s wall is built, being of a reddKh kind, and of a very fine grit ; it required feven millions of 
cartloads to have made fo ftupendous a work ; and therefore I believe they had it from the Caledonian 
“ fide of the water, where all the country for fome miles round abounds with It, and likewlfe affords 
“ great quantities of llmeftone.
“ After all, I cannot but take notice of two things with regard to this wall, that have given me great 
“ matter of fpeculation.
The firft is, why It was made at all, for It could never be a proper defence, and 
“ perhaps at Boulnefs lefs than at any other place, fince our barbarian forefathers on the north fide could 
pafs over at low water ; and If the fea was then higher or deeper than It is now, could make their attacks 
“ from the north-eaft fide by laud.
The fecond is, why the Scots hiftorians, vain enough by nature, 
“ have not taken more pains to deferibe the wall, — a performance which did their anceftors more honour 
than all the trifling ftones put together which they have tranfmitted to us.
It Is true the Romans 
“ walled out humanity from us ; but It Is as certain they thought the Caledonians a ver\ formidable 
people, when they, at fo much labour and coft, built this wall ; as before they had made a vallum 
<« between Forth and Clyde.”

The baron, in his letter to Mr. Gale, would impute to the Romans great foil/ 
and ufelcfs labour and expence in the conftrudion of the before defcribed 
Pratenlura, contrary to the opinion we have given of their propriety therein.
— 
In a matter of fuch confequence to the antiquarian, as the proper eflimate of this 
ftupendous work of the Romans is, we will lay before them, in the notes, a furvey 
of this coalf, publiflied in the Gentleman’s Magazine in the year 1748, where, 
from the teftimony of a perfon who could have no idea of the dilcordance of 
opinions on this fubjecfr, the reader will be enabled to make his own determi- 
nation.* 
We 
• “I was extremely fenfible of the want of correct maps in the courfe of my furvey ; In my opinion the 
“ nation ought to encourage general meridians through Britain, at leaft from Berwick to the fouth coaft of 
“ England, as has been done in France.
Geography gains fall, and by a few obfervations of the ecliples of 
“ Jupiter’s fatellites, made at different places, by proper obfervators, our longitudes might all be corredled.
“ The piinclpal objcAion I own is the great expence of the work ; but it is very well known, that 
“ Moll’s little erroneous trifles, built altogether on copy, took remarkably well ; and certainly, in a more 
“ curious age, correft ones would want no encouragement.
It was my bufinefs every night to prepare 
“ meridians by the north pole, in cafes of miftakes by the needle, after allowances made for the pofltlon 
“ of the pole ftar from the point of the earth’s produced axis againll my morning’s works.
“ I could not find that the points of Derwent mouth bore near fo much well, as fuppofed in the prc- 
“ fent maps, the makers of which I imagined depended on the inagnetical meridian more than the folar 
•* one.
And indeed, as the difference of the magnetical and folar meridians is very near i8° on this 
“ coaft, it is not to be wondered that furveyors following the needle fhould throw all promontories fo 
“ much fouth of weft, and all coafts too much fouth of weft, as feems to be the cafe in conftru6fing on 
“ thofe principles ; the magnetical being a falfe meridian, though failors ufe it for a true one.
Obfer- 
“ vations by the needle, uncorrefted by the folar, are at leaft about i 12th point weft of the north.
It 
“ has increafed on this coaft fince 1715 from 14°.
to 17°.
30'.
where it is now, but is ftill increafing.
— 
“ I have marked the pofition of the fands from the beft intelligence.
Though the fea coaft ismoft ufeful 
“ to be taken as it appears for the fervice of manners, yet it is great pity that public encouragement is 
“ not offered for accurate maps of the land alfo.
I began at the monument on Burgh marfh to meafure 
“ oft' the Solway bay' ; and as the ground was very low, I took feveral bafes of triangles to meafure the 
“ oppofite fhore, and fix Its principal points.
For general heights to keep conftantly in my eye, I fixed 
“ on three remarkable mountains, as judging they might be feen through the greateft of the extent of 
“ my furvey ; thefe were Skiddaw, in Cumberland, Criffold, and Burnfwark, in Scotland.
The ground 
“ was very troublefome, by reafon of the frequent creeks and quickfands, fo that I could reach no further 
“ than Bownefs on the 27th at night.
From the monument, the coaft is extremely low on the Fnglifli 
“ fide, and a fine pafture to Drumbugh.
At Bowiicfs I took a new meridian, to afeertain the truth of 
“ my triangles.
It is properly fo called, from the bend of the coaft at this promontory, which is the 
moll remarkable one on the Solway bay', at leaft on the Englifn fide.
It is to be remarked, that the 
“ river Eden has of late years kept ahnoft clofe under the Scotch fliore ; but its courfe is conftantly 
“ varying by the rapidity of land floods at low ebbs, through fuch a foft and fiimy fand, that no chart 
“ can be given with certainty of Its frefh water-courfe ; befides the fands are extremely uncertain and 
“ dangerous to enter upon.
I proceeded forward by Uln or Elnfoot : the Ihore is a fine hard fand, and 
“ the coaft above at fome diftance high and woody, particularly above Flimby, a little village with fait- 
“ pans : thefe woods are called Flimby Parks, and the country affumes a better afpeiSl.
“ When we get to a Angle houfe called the Bom, the coaft elbows round, and the whole track from 
“ thence to Derwent mouth is a low benty foil, fo broken with rabbits, that it is almoft impoffibk* to ride 
it after night falls.
The river Derwent is the fecond for magnitude in Cumberland : it might be made 
“ navigable to Cockermouth by culling through fome grounds and erefting locks, for it admits fhips of 
“ tolerable burthen for coafters to Workington.
Workington feems a town of pretty trade, above 50 
** veffels belong to it, and the harbour dilates above the pier, which breaks the extreme violence of tidea 
“ by wefterly winds, and affords a good harbour.
As it lay out of my limits, I paffed the Derwent in a 
“ boat.

PARISH OF BOWNESS.
We have tranfcribed the annexed piece, unmutilated ; as it may gratify feme 
readers in thofe deferipcions which were not immediately pertinent to the chief 
purpofe of our quotation ; and would in no wife interrupt the argument we would 
deduce, that the coaft fouthward of the Roman Preetentur^, from its nature, in 
fome 
** boat, and proceeded to follow the courfe of the coaft.
On the oppofite fide, we came up with the 
“ light-houfe and high land, which we had feen for feveral miles ; they are principal fea-tnarks for 
“ Workington harbour.
The land was now high again, but fleirted with low benty ground for rabbit- 
“ warrens, with which the whole coaft from the Grune abounds : but makes a very bad appearance, 
becaufe the eye is prefcntly taken off by tlie height of the banks on your left hand, which of themfelve* 
form a very different landfcape.
At Harrington lalt-pans and before, the coaft, from bad, grew worfc 
“ and worfe; the rocks, or ftones equal to rocks, grew infupportable for either horfe or foot.
— I ordered 
the horfes up land, at foot-ways cut from the pans along very fteep rocky brows, finding the coaft 
now itnpraHicable for riding and walking, under the (hocking precipices, where no mortal could have 
“ gone in fpring tides, becaufc the fea waftres them to a great height.
The fea was then full and ftormy, 
and I often felt its fprinklings break into drops by the violent (hock upon the low rocks, on whofe top 
“ was all the path we had.
Both blarringtoti falt-pans, which are now not wrought, and the old ones 
of Leuco, which are tumbling into ruins every fpring tide, are (hockingly fituated.
“ After a fine coaft and Inland, we came to Whitehaven, which is a thriving and well-built town ; it 
exceeds Carlllle In extent one-third, but Is thrice as populous.
The ftiects are extremely ftraight and 
“ regular In mod places : there is a general appearance of induftry amongft the inhabitants, and the hurry 
“ and buftle which accompanies their trade feems to be natural and eafy.
The vaft fupply of coals in this 
“ neighbourhood has raifed this port from a filhing town, to be the next after Briftol and l,iverpool on 
the weft fea ; and the roads leading to it are equal to the beft turnpikes about London, and are every day 
“ Improving and carrying forward.
Its fituation is low, in comparifon to the great height of the coaft on 
all fides of it ; and the harbour Is barricadoed with feveral piers, to bridle the fury of the weft winds, 
“ to which it is greatly expofed.
Here the coimtry puts on a much better appearance, and a fine vale 
“ enriches Bees-Hcad from Whitehaven to the little brook below Seacote, full of pleafant village's and 
“ country feats.
There is a fmall for t at the outer pier, to command the harbour ; of no great ftrength 
by fituation.
— There feems wanting a lower battery on the pier itfelf.
On Bees-Head there is a 
light-houfe ; but, in my opinion, the a-adle is too much funk within the battlements to afford a 
ferviceable light to fallors : the point indeed is fo prodigloufly expofed, that a greater elevation would 
“ occafion a far greater confuraptlon of fire ; but coals are fo plentiful in this neighbourhood, the expence 
“ ought not to be regarded, as it is the firft land that failors from the weft endeavour to make.
They 
“ compute it ten leagues from this promontory' to the Ifle of Mann ; I make It more, by conneAing of 
“ triangles to the Paps of Mann, whither I took my aim.
Tbe town or village of St. Bees is pleafantly 
“ fituated in a vale, where they fuppofe the fea formerly flowed.
Here is a good free-fehool, and a fine 
retreat for youth.
It Is equal to feveral market-towns In bignefs, and the fea has left St. Bees a 
village only.
From henoe we found the fand very loofe, which occafions great labour to the traveller, 
till we came to the Calder, a ftream running through a very romantic country into the fea, without 
“ any harbour.
At about a mile diftance fiom Cauder mouth, is a very dangerous rock, only feen at 
“ extreme low ebbs.
It is called Drig-rock, and, in the courfe of feven years, has only been obferved 
“ twice.
Here is abundance of all kinds of crabs and lobfters, and other teftacious fi(h ; and the largeft 
“ oyfters in Britain.
“ From Bownes*^, the coaft continues high for about a mile weftward, to How-point, when it falls 
“ low again ; winding by Scargeril-head, till we came to Cardronac hay, which is a vei'y dangerous one, 
“ being full of (hifting quickfands, by reafon of tire rivers and land waters : thefe, after rains, hurry the 
“ fands into a loofe Oudge, which muft be.

“ Cardrokac is an inUgnificant village, in a wretched country, almofl quite environed with fea and 
morafles.
“ The Grune is a remarkable head of land, whofe pofition the common maps have widely millaken.
“ It is now only a rabbit-warren, and hardly any veftige left where an ancient chapel ftood, called the 
“ chapel of the Grune : the whole is a low beachy coaft.
The Dutch would make a gainful acquifitlon 
“ by dyking off this bay, was it in Holland ; for the tide recedes fo as one may pafs it in any place for 
“ feveral hours together.
“ From hence the coaft inclines more foutherly, but is fo extremely poor, that one could not meet 
** with a finglc public-houfe, or any refreftiment, from Holm Abbey to Allonby.
This whole coaft, till 
“ you come at a houfe called Beck-foot, is full of fandy hills, blown and raifed by the winds, and are very 
** tirefomc travelling, upon.
Allonby is grown from a pi'etty village to a kind of market, efpecially 
“ In the fummer ; it ftretches along the coaft in a ftraggling mariner, but is tolerably well built, and has 
•* a confiderable concourfe for bathing.
Hill-houfe is a fea-mark, becaufe It ftands pretty high, and i« 
made ufe of in the fame manner almoft as Dubmill-houfe, to avoid a dangerous land which ftretches 
“ almoft from Workington bar to the Scotch coaft.
“ When How’michael chapel and the faddle on Bees-Head are In one line, you may avoid the 
fwamp ; and when Dubm.ill-houfe and mount Skiddarw are in a line, you are on the tail of Dubmill 
“ fwainp, and fo may turrv down the Solway : it is about half a mile broad.
Flence there is a low coaft 
“ till you pafs the Blue-dial ; then the fhore begins to be hanky, and rifes by degrees to tlie Bank-end- 
“ point, with a (leirt of low ground under the banks for rabbit-warrens.
I'he fea fands are full of ftones, 
*' fome pretty large.
On this ftrore I faw the ftar-fifti, the concha, periwinkle, and peftines, and hardly

without riding almoft up to the mountains.
If there was occalion for it, a fmall matter would render 
“ it unapproachable.
“ The Perch is a word ufed here for the mouth of a harbour ; there Is a large poll raifed in the middle 
*' of the channel of Ra^englafs harbour, for a poll of direcHon : to fuch as thefe, candles and lanthorns 
“ arc fixed for night-guides In moft places.
Tliis harbour is extremely ill reprelented in all maps ; 
“ certainly no geographer has ever inlpeifted it : three tolerable ftreams empty themfelves into It: of all 
“ the three, Elk is the furlhcft navigable, even great way above Monkcafter-PIall, Sir Jc)feph Penning- 
“ ton’s feat, quite to the mountains, for veflels of tolerable burthen.
Notwithftanding, government keeps 
“ a preventing officer at this town : he is fo flood-locked, that he mull of eu be an idle fpedtator of that 
foul practice of fmuggling, witliout having It in his power to prevent it.
From the fea-fide is a very 
“ Ihocking landfcape of fells and precipices, bate and quite void of foil to the weft ward, as Is obferved 
“ through the world ; fo that, whilft the eaft fide affords fine pafturage, the weft will hardly fupport a

Amidft thefe precipices, Ihocking as they are, many beautiful narrow vales are interfperfed,

hard of accefs between Bownefs and Elenborough, that, when the iflhmus on the 
Solway Frith was fortified to the point of the naze, the Roman province was well 
fecured from fudden attacks — all parts of the wall were as accefiibleas that pointed 
out by Baron Clark ; and his objedtion holds as good to the general tenor of that 
Ifupendous work, as in that branch which runs along this ifthmus.
I'o return to our fubjedt of Bowness — It was a dependent manor of the barony 
of Burgh, one of whofe barons granted it to Game!
de Brun.* — “ Bownefs is a 
common name to the manor, town, and parifh there.
One of the firft barons of 
“ Burgh, after the conqueft, gave the fame to Gamel le Brun.
It containeth on 
the north fide, where the fea floweth up into the river of Eden, the town of 
“ Bownefs itfelf, Glafion, Drumbugh, and Eafton, where the bounder of the fame 
crofieth over fouthward, on the eaft fide of Fingland and Whitrigg, unto 
Wampool, and taketh in all the afore-mentioned towns of Whitrigg, Whitrigg- 
Lees, Lang-Crofts, Fingland, Aynthorn, and Caedurnok, all which make a great 
point of land into the fea, thrulling in between the waters of Wampool and 
Eden.
A goodly manor it was while entire, but now it is divided into feveral parts.
Bownefs was antiently called Bu'.gium Biatum of the Romans, who, as I think, 
** framed this word Bulgiiim of a word now in ufe with us, namely, -which 
“ fignifieth a breaking in, as the fea there fwelling breaks in.
But whereof they 
took this word Biatum I cannot perceive, unlefs from that place in Scotland, a 
“ little from Tordoff', called Blawt Wood, which foundeth, the fea fwelling or 
“ bulging in at Blawt.
But this name Bownefs, as fome have thought, was given 
to the place of this word moje, w’hich the Scots and this country people call 
** neeje, which fignifies a point of land into the fea ; and fo they commonly call it: 
and for that the land here makes a crooked point into the fea, they call 
it Bownefs.
Others have writ it Bowl-nefs, as a w'ord made of bowling, which is 
** fwelling, and the faid word nejs, a point; for that often times the tide coming 
W'ith the wind, the fea breaks in at the point with great fury.
— But however it 
was called, it was a mofl: antient thing and a great building, as appeareth by the 
antient foundations and paved fireets which are daily found in the common fields 
by the inhabitants.
It is feated at the weft end of that memorable work, the 
Picfts wall.
“ The church is placed at Bownefs, but the capital mclTuage at Drumbugh, 
where the fiiid Gamel Brun and his pofteriry dwelt.
It is called Drumbugh of 
that fenny mire or bog, then full of fiirubs and haunted with bitterns, which 
the people call mire-drornbles ; fo as that w’ord Drumbugh fignifies the bitterns

Morvill confirmed.
After William Engayne, fucceeeded Sir Hugh Pvlorvill,* as fon and heir of 
Ada, foie daughter and heir of the faid William.
In the time of King Henry II.
“ this Sir Hugh Morvill was of great poflelTions.
In Cumberland, he was Lord 
of Burgh barony, Lazonby, and Ifliall.
In Wefimorland, of Temple Sowerby, 
Honflun, &c.
and about Wharton he had divers lands.
The great mountain, 
Hiigb-Sea!-Morvill, was called after him.
He was one of the four knights who 
killed St. Thomas Becker, Archbifnopof Canterbury; after which deed he came 
to great mifery.
He gave therefore the redtory of Burgh to the abbey of Holm 
“ Cviltram, which the Bifhops of Carlifle, Bernard, Hugh, and Walter, did appro- 
priatc to the monks.
The fword that killed St. Thomas was at Ifhall in my 
father’s time, and fince remaincth with the houfe of Arundel.
He was greatly 
hated of the churchmen of his time; therefore they wrote many things to his 
*' difhonour, hardly to be credited, which J omit.
After great repentance, he died, 
“ and left two daughters his heirs ; Johan, wife to Richard Werun, or Gerun ; and 
Ada, wife firft to Richard Lucy.t fccondly to Thomas Multon, and thirdly 
to William Lord Furnival.
“ After Sir Hugh Morvill, fucceeded Richard Lucy and Richard Werun, with 
the two daughters of Sir Hugh, in the inheritance of Burgh.
Richard Lucy had by his wife Ada only two daughters, Annabel and Alice ; 
“ and therefore, after her death, the moiety of Burgh fell to the fecond Thomas 
Multon aforefaid, brother to Lambert Multon of Egremont.;|: 
Richard Werun had by his wife, Johan Morvill, Sara (or Ada) a daughter, 
married to Richard Boyvill, Baron of Kirklevington ; who had iffue Hawife, 
the 
* Ada married Simon de Morvill, who was the fon of Hugh de Morvill.

for livery of the lands he claimed in right of his wife, who was the daughter of William de Lancaftre ; 
they left iffue a daughter and heir Helen, who married Rowland de Galway.
Roger de Morvill had iffue Sir Hugh, named in the text.
Some authors have afferted, that, after 
executing their fanguinary purpofe, Sir Hugh and l.is accomplices took hoifes from the archbifhcp’e 
ffahlc, and rode te Knarfbrough, where Sir Hugh held large poffeffions, and where they committed fuch 
enormities, as to gain the deteftation of the neighbourhood.
Sir Hugh married Helewife de Stuteville, 
who pcffeffed the manors of Kirkofwald and Lazonby.
2d year of King John, he obtained licence to 
iiiclofe his woods of Kirkofwald, to fortify bis houfe, and to have a yearly fair and weekly market there.
He rendered to the king 15 marks and 2 palfreys, to hold his court with toll, theam, infangtheof, fire 
and water ordeal, and other regal powers wiiliin this manor, during the life of his wife.

Burgh, by our befi antiquaries, is faid to be the Axelodunum of the Romans; 
and, according to Mr. Horlley’s and Mr. Warburton’s fcale of ftations ad lineavi 
valliy was the fixteenth city ; and, conformable to the feries in the Notitia, had the 
cohors prima Hifpanonm in garrifon for fame time.
Thefe antiquaries fay, that 
Hexham has been univerfally taken to be the Axelodunnm, but pofitively alFert it is 
from mere conjecture, and without any reafon to fupport it; “ there is much bet-

“ and where there has undoubtedly been a fiation.” — “ I am furprized the inferip-

** mondlhire, before tiie decline of the empire ; but, according to the Notitia, this 
cohort was afterwards fixed at Virojidum : 1 am therefore of opinion, that when 
“ this cohort advanced to Virojidum^ which I take to be Ellcnborough, the cohors 
“ prima Hifpanonm removed from Ellcnborough to Burgh on the Sands, and this 
is Axelodumm, at w hich the Notitia places this cohort.” 
From what will be noted of the cobors prma Hijpanorim being refident at 
Netherby, we are afeertained of its change through three flations; and, by this 
fluctuation, the certainty of determining the proper appellation of each ftation by 
inferiptions correfponding with the appoinments of the Notitia, is confidcrably 
injured.
“ The ftation has been a little to the eaft of the church, near what they cal!
the 
“ Old Caftle, w'here there are the manifeft remains of its ramparts.
On the weft: 
fide thefe remains are moft diftind;, being about fix chains in length ; and 
“ Severus’s wall feems to have formed the north rampart of the ftation.
Here w e 
have but one infeription, and that altogether imperfeft.
It would fcarce have 
been worth while to take notice of this ftone, had it not been that it is a confir-' 
mation that there has been a ftation here; for it is undoubtedly Roman.
From 
its ftiape, it feems to have been erected by fome of the legions : it was lying 
“ under the fpout of a pump, where, by the frequent fall of water, it was worn 
very much in the middle.
Befides this ftone, there were tw'o altars lying at a 
** dopr in the town, but quite defaced.
There was alfo a large ftone cheft: ftand- 
“ ing in the church-yard, and other marks of antiquity, and of a Roman ftation 
** here.” 
Since the publication of the w’orks of Mr. Florfley and Mr. Warburton, from 
which we made the foregoing extrads, a fmall altar was found in the vicar’s 
garden at Burgh, and communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by Biftiop 
Lyttleton, w hofe letter on that fubjed we place in the notes.* 
The

which certainly ftands for Belatucndro, and I think the fifth infeription which has

“ with Camden and Gale, or at lead another name for Apollo with Dr. Ward, and not a cognomen of 
“ Mars, or any other appellation of him, as has been conjectured.
“ The firft, in point of time, that has been difeovered, was inferibed on an altar dug up at Elienborough,

The infcription is rude and ill cut, and was communicated to us by the Rev.
Mr. Ifmay, to whom we were greatly indebted for information relative to this part 
of 
“ infcription, declares his opinion very ftrongly, that Belatucader was a local deity, though afterwards, 
whrn he fpeaks of the Netherby altar, above mentioned, inferibed to Deo Marti Belatucadro, forgetting 
“ what he had urged a few pages before, of Belatucader being a local deity, he concurs with the author 
“ of the additions to Camden, In pronouncing Belatucader a cognomen only of the god Mars.
“ Dr. Ward litigates this notion very ably, and obferves from Seldon and Vofiius, that Belatucader 
“ was the fame as Belimis, or whom both Hadrian and Capotllinus affirm to be Apollo ; who, it 
appears from Aufonius, was worfliipped by the Druids.
Dr. Ward adds — “ I cannot but incline to 
“  think that this deity was Apollo rather than Mars, both from the affinity of the name with other names 
“ of Apollo, and becaufe 1 do not find the epithet fanclut ever given to Mars ; and here the infcription 
“ runs, Deo fan£}o Belatucadro”

“ Kirby There, Wedmorland, and runs thus — DEO BELATVCADRO LIB.

I. O.
L. V.
S. This lad correfponds exactly with mine, being addrelTcd fimply to the god Belatucader.
Now, as four out of five inferiptions wherein Belatucader occurs, have no adjunct but Deo, Dr. Ward’s 
“ conjev^lure, that the et In the Netherby Infcription has been omitted by the tranferibers, is ftrongly 
“ confirmed ; and confequently Belatucader was not a cognomen of Mars, but cither a local deity wor- 
fliipped by the Romanized Britains in this part of the province, or another name for Apollo.” 
Mr. Pegge’s remarks on Belatucader, publilhed in the Archaeologla, are to the following effeft : — • 
“ Something was faid in the Effay-s on the Coins of Cunobelin on Belatucadrm, a deity either of the 
“ Romanized Britains, or of the Romans refident in Britain ; and it was there afferted, that he was the 
“ fame with Mars, being efteemed a local name of this deity.
Since then an infcription, accompanied 
“ with a memoir, has been produced by my late moft refpeftable friend, BIfttop Lyttleton, in which.
“ paper, his lordfhip, concurring with the late profeflbr Ward, reckons him to be a local deity, as do moft 
“ others, but with a reference to Apollo, who w^as worlhipped, as they obferve, by the Druids.
And 
herein they have on their fide Sammes, Seldon, Hearne, Montfaucon, and the authors of the Univerfal 
“ Hiftory.
Notwithftanding the weight of all this authority, I fee no reafon to depart from my former 
“ afiertlon, and hope I may ftand acquitted by the candid, if, in juftification thiTeof, I here refumc 
“ the further confideration of the fubjerft.
It was faid the god of war feems to have had different na.mes 
“ in various parts of the iflanJ.
Amongft the Trinobantes, or Catuvcllauni, to have been called Canulus ; 
“ by the Brigantes Belatucadrus ; by the CoritanI Braciaca ; and perhaps by others Hefus, or Ejut.
— 
“ Now all the five infer-prions yet difuovered, concerning Belatucadrm, were found amongft tke Brigantes ; 
*' and the point to be difeuffed is, whether by this barbarous title was intended a local diety anfwerable 
“ and equivalent to Apollo, or the god Mars, as Mr. Baxter, Dr. Gale, Mr. Horfley in one place, aad 
“ myfelf, have maintained.
“ Thofe who contend for Apollo, proceed upon the etymology ; the application of the word fauftur, 
“ which they think becomes not Mars ; and, Iartly% a fufpiclon that one of the Inferiptions, which runs 
“ Deo Marti Belatucadro, is mlfwritten on the ftone, aad was intended to he Deo Marti et Belatucadt o.
“ They think, in the firft place, they difeover fomething of Belinus, or the name of Ap.-rllo, in 
“ the term Belatucadrus ; and fo Mr. Hearne Interprets of Apollo Sigittarius, on account, I prefume, of 
“ the in Greek.
But furely little ftreCs can be laid on this, fince both Mr. Baxter and Dr. Gale 
“ have, with equal, perhaps greater, probability, deduced this name from the Btitifli, and have fiiewn it 
“ may be a very proper adjunCl to Mars.
The firft analyzes it, Bel at in Cadcr quod ejl Beius et arcem 
“ viontis ; and the lecond writes pojleriorque pars diflionis aliqui.i fpirat ijiius nuntinii ( martis fcil.
) cum 
“ cad proelium cadcr cajlrum et cadr fortis Britannice fonent, qua ovinia Marti fatifeongruunt.
“ In the next place, as to the application of the word fanfius to Belatucadrus, Mars was a natural 
divinity with the Britons and Romans, the founder of Rome, as was pretended, was defeended from 
“ him; and, as the Rex hoviinuni et Deorutn was with them Jupiter, fo the god of war was ftiled Marfpiter ; 
“ ar.d if Jupiter had his fiamen dialis.
Mars had his f,amen rnartialis.
The Britons, thofe who were 
“ Romanized, we may be aihired would adopt tlie like peculiar veneration for him.
Befides, as Mars is 
fo currently ftiled Dens, where is the wonder that the term fan£lus (hould be applied to him ?

“ Bebtucadrus, in 6ur ftone.
But wh^t is ftill more diredt to the purpofe, Mr. Horfley, in Cumber-

A Angularity which attends the above fad is, that the army muft have Iain, and 
the royal tent been pitched, in a moft improper place, on marlhy ground, on a 
dead level ; when, within a quarter of a mile further louthward, there was a fine 
inclining ground, dry and healthy, and not fubjed to any furprife or attack from 
fuperior heights.
Any one who has viewed this place, would be inclined to believe

a fkilful general would not encamp an army on the fpot that tradition and this 
monument point out.
Camden further adds — “ The inhabitants fay that, under the aforefaid Burgh, in 
" the very aelluary, there was a fight between the Scotch and Englifh; and that, 
“ when the tide came in, the difpute was managed by the horfe ; which feems no 
** Icfs ftrange than what Pliny relates, with great admiration, of fuch another place 
“ in Caramania.
This teftuary is called by both nations Solway Frith, from 
" Solway, a town of the Scots, that ftands wipon it.
But Ptolemy calls it more 
“ probably Ituna, from the Eden, a very noble river, which winds by Weftmor- 
" land, and through the inner parts of this county, and falls into it with a vaft 
** body of waters : ftill remembering the obflrudlions it met with from the car- 
” caffes of the Scots in the year 1216, when it drowned them with their Englifh 
fpoils, and fwallovved up the plundering crew.” 
The great banking wmrk effedled in Holdernefs, proves how eafy it would be to 
recover a large and valuable tra(fl of ground in this sff uary, w here no fuch vehemence 
of wind and tide is experienced, as on the ealtern coafts.
There feems a ftrong 
natural caufe for the difference between the eaft and well coafl: in that particular, 
on account of the current which fets into the Irifh channel, and prevents fuch 
vehement beating of the tides on the fhores, where there is no fuch eflux and reflux 
to take off the weight of waters to a peculiar channel.
The parifh of Burghf is five miles wefi from Carlifle, and nine north from

\ix.
Thomas Stordy, of (Stonehoufe) Moorhoufe, who was born to the inheritance of a handfome 
edate ; but, imbibing the principles of the people called ^takers, a great (hare of fuffering fell to hfs lot.
Being at Carlifle affizes in the year 16^2, he w’ent to vifit fome of his friends in prifon, where he was 
illegally detained by the gaoler, and the next day was carried before the court, where the oath of allegiance 
was tendered to him, and which he refufed to take, not in contempt of the king, but in obedience to the 
precept of Chrift, “ Swear not at all” and was fent back to gaol among the felons ; the next day he 
was indldfed on the ftatutc of 3d Jac. and had the fentence of premunire paffed upon him, which wa» 
a forfeiture of both his real and perfonal eftate.
Soon after this his corn, cattle, and other goods were 
felzcd, and a fale had, at which they were fold far below the value, becaufe few cared to buy them, as 
efteeming them no better than plunder.
Under this hard fentence he was detained a clofe prifoner ten 
years, until he was releafed by the king’s declaration, in 1672 : his real eftate was reftored to him 
through the IntercefGon of the humane Earl of Carlifle.
And fome few years afterwards he was profecutei 
on the obfolete ftatute of 23d of Elizabeth, for 20I.
a month for abfenting himfelf from the public worfhip, 
caft into prifon, and detained there feveral years, until his death, which happened in 1684.
A little 
before his death, he exhorted his friends to faithfulnefs : “ If,” fays he, “ you continue faithful to the 
“ Lord whilil ye live in this world, he will reward you, as he now' doth me, with bis fweet peace.” — 
His teftimony againft tithes was remarkable, and proved to be truly confclentlous ; he not only refufed 
to pay them, but to receive them ; for he inherited an impropriation of ten pounds per annum value 
then,  which he freely leleafed to the owners of the land (to whom he thought they of right belonged) 
by a legal inftrument, quitting claim thereto for himfelf and his heirs for ever.

advanced In years, came more Immediately to experience in himfelf the vlfitatlon of divine grace, which 
teacheth to live foberly, rightcoufly and godly ift this prefent world In the year 1704 he came forth 
in a public teftimony to the univerfality of the love of God in Chrift Jefus.
He attended the yearly 
meetings in London feveral times, and vifited the meetings of friends In divers parts of this nation, in 
Scotland more generally, and in Ireland two different times.
He bore a faithful teftimony againft the

This parlfli contains about fix fquare miles.
Soil and Produce.] A great part of thlsparifti, net many years ago, confifted of common orwalle 
land ; at prefent a part of the common land, though divided, is uncultivated, and even unfenced.
The new 
improvements, are yet poor and barren in general.
The foil is various-; a fort of gravelly clay predomi- 
aates, and is moltly heavy, cold, and wet.
It produces corn tolerably.
Wheat and oats are much fown.
Rent.] Average about I2s.
per acre.
Fuel.] Peat, turf, and coal.
— No coal, limcftone, nor freeltone found here.
Game.] Hares, partridges, See.
School.] One at Orton, not endowed.
Tithes.] This parifh pays tithes in kind.
Tenure ] Generally freehold, under Sir John Brifco, of Cix)fton-PlaGe.
Rivers and Roads.] Here are no rivers, and few fprings — The road from Carlifle to Wigton leads 
through this parith.
Aspect axd General Appearance.] This parifh is not very unlevel ; part of It inclines to the 
fouth, and a little to the caft.
— The buildings are mollly of clay.
Thefe hoiifes are generally made up 
in a day or two ; for, when a perfon wants a houfe, barn, &c.
built, he acquaints his neighbours, wh3 
all appear at the time appointed ; fome lay on clay, fdme tread it, vvliilfl; others are preparing flraw to 
mix it with.
By this means, building comes low and expeditious : — and indeed it muft be owned, that ' 
they have brought the art of clay-huilding to fome perfeftion.
They generally ground with ffone about 
a yard high : and a houfe thus built will if and (It is faid) 150 or 200 years.
— I'he parifh abounds with 
wood, particularly upon the hedges : tnoftly oak and birch, but not large.-- Housman’s Notes.
J Such is the fituatiofi of Orton, that, from a frr.all Inclofure a little weft of the village, called Parfon’i 
Thorji, fifteen parifti churches may be diiliiuElly feen, befides fevcral in Scotland, with a beautiful view 
of Gretha : in  fh'ort, few places, if any, in ‘the county can boaft of fo noble a profpe£l.
Several towns 
may be viewed from the above llation of ground, viz.
the city of Carlifle, the market-towns of Brampton, 
Wigton, and Longtown ; llke'wlfe Peiirith beaccri, Crofs-fell, Gilfland, the Scotch mountains, a diftindl:

PARISH OF ORTON,

The church is redlorial, and now worth about one hundred and forty pounds per 
annum: the advowfon and right of prefentacion remain appendant to the manor of 
Orton.
This village is fuppofetl formerly to have been a market -town — It has evideiuly been a place of note, 
from the many Roman caufeways, and other foundations dug up near it.
— There is a lane leading front 
the north end of this village, about ^00 yards in length, at the end of which is a large fofiTe, or double 
ditch, where an iron chain went acrofs the road, and was locked every night, called ^rrafs Gaie^ made 
as a defence againft the frequent Incuifions of the Scots, or Mofs-Troopers.
There is a traditional 
account, that one of thefe Mofs-Troopeis being obferved, as he was viewing the fituaiion of the place, 
by one of the villagers of the name of WIlfcn, (and whofe defeeudants hold his property to this day) 
Wilfon took up his bow, and Ihot an ai row from his own houfe over Barrafs Gate, the diflance of 400 
yards, whjch pierced through the thigh of the invader, and lluck faft in his horft’s faddle.
The entrance 
into the village to the call had the fame defence, and the whole parilh was incloled wdth a flro.ng earth 
fence and deep ditch, called the Ring Fence.
The pariflr is bounded by the parifh of St. Mary' on the 
eaft, by Burgh and a part of Bampton and Kirkandrews upon Eden on the north, by Aikton on the 
weft, by Thurfby^ and a fmall part of Daliion on the fouth.
It has an eafy afeent from all quarters.
— 
There is no hill 01 rock in the parifh ; nor rivulet, brook, or burn ; nor can any body of water be cof- 
lefted together in it fufficient to werL a common mill, owing to its conical form ; yet the inhabitants 
are fuEciently fupplied with water at all feafons of the year, from a variety of fpnngs and ftanding kikes, 
the former of rvhich are conveyed in lotr.e places by conduits.
Property in this parifh in general is very equally divided ; and, except fome detached pieces, the lands 
have been in the poffeffion of the prefent occupiers and their anceftois time immemorial.
The eftates 
are on an average worth between 30I.
and 7c!.
per annum, except two forms of look each, belonging 
to Sir John Bril’co, Baft.
The chur^;h ftands nearly in the centre of the parifh.
'I'he value of the 
living, including the glebe, is, in conwiunibtts annis, worth 140I.
fterling.
The par fonage- houfe, church, 
and fchool-houfe adjoining, are ail in excellent repair.
— Thomas Pattinfon, bachelor, 3 parifhioner of 
Bownefs, in the year 1785, bequeathed the fum of lool.
for an endowment to this fchool, left in the 
hands of the reftor of Bownefs, Mr. John Kodgfon of Eafton, and Mr. John Wilfon of Weft-End, as 
truftees, who have funk it in the funds at 4I.
per cent.
The prefent khoolmaftcr and parifh-clcrk, 
Richard Dixon, has taught in the fald fchool near forty years, and confequently has been the inftruftor of 
fnoft of the prefent inhabitants ; he calls himfelf Happy Dick, and is generally fo ftyled by the 
pariftiioners.
The inhabitants are iober, regular, indiiftnous, and chearful people, and all chiefly occupied in culti- 
vating their own eftates, except a few farmers, and thirty -three weavers, etpployed to woik for the 
flourifhing manufafiory now at Dalfton, lately under the conduA of Mr. Hodfon.
It cannot be laid that they have imported every' luxury into this parifh j yet they enjoy, in a reafon- 
able degree, all the conveniences and comforts of fociety, and are in general more contented in their 
fituaticr.
than moft people.
With refpeil to the morals of the people, it maybe obferved, that no native 
of the parifh w'as ever conviAed and baniftied for theft.
— No contention has at anytime happened which 
rendered it neceffary to call in the authority of the magiftrate ; nor ever any litigation relating to property, 
except one fuit with the lord of the manor above fifty years ago, — at w'hich time their tight was fully 
3;onfirmed : in fhort, the inhabitants may be fold to be as one family, friendly and unanimous amongll 
themfelves, and hcfpitable to firangers.
In tlieir vacant hours, young and old mix together: they profefs 
all kinds of rural amufements, and to which in general they are much attached.
Tlius, by temperance 
and moderate exeicifc, they are healthy, robuft, and chearfui, and many of them live to a remarkable old 
age.
— There is only one public houfe in this paalfli, at Woodhoufes, half way between Carlifle and 
Wigton.
Not many years ago a very curious and neat fandal was found in the peat-mofs, well preferved, as it is 
apprehended, from the quality of the peat-earth.
Wc are indebted to fcveral valuable correfpondents for this account of Orton.

THE PAI^ISH OF GRINSDALE, 
(IN CUMBER I.
AND WARD.) 
“ TV TEXT unto Kirkanders lies Grinsdale, a parifn, town, and manor within 
“ Burgh barony, and holden of ihe fame.
It gave firname unto a family of 
gentlemen called Grinfdalcs.
The moll antient of the name I read of, was one 
Udard de Grinfdale ; and after him Alkecill, the Ton of Robert de Grinfdale, 
that lived in the time of Henry I.
Stephen, and Henry II.
The cldeft line 
“ failed about King John's time, when the inheritance fell to two daughters j 
whereof one was married to the Lord of Newton, in Allerdale, one Thomas de 
" Newton, held by that right the moiety of Grinfdale of Thomas de Multon, Lord 
“ of Burgh in Henry III.’s time ; and the other moiety was then fo holden by one 
'' William de la Sore, whole anceftor had married the other coparcener.
A fecund 
brother of Afketill, called Robert, was a citizen of Carlifle, and purchafed lands 
** there and in Parton, which defeended according to the following pedigree, until 
“ the coparceners and their heirs fold the fame to the Denton’s of Cardew in 
" Henry IV.’s time, vvhofe iffue male enjoyeth the fame at this day.
“ Udard dc Grinfdale — Robert — Afketill — Robert, brother of Afketill— Gilbert 
— Robert — Gilbert — Allan — Henry, who had ilTue two daughters and heirs, 
“ Marriott and Margaret, who conveyed the eflate to the Dentons, as aforefaid, 
“ and in whom expired that race of gentlemen, unlefs, perhaps, the Grindalls be 
of their pofterity.
“ Newton’s moiety of Grinfdale fell by marriage to Martindale, and to one of 
the Dacres, named Richard Dacre, in the right of his wife, one of the coheirs of 
Martindale.
His iffue, William Dacre and himfelf, for following Leonard 
Dacre in the lall rebellion, loH the fame, and now it is in the queen’s hands by 
** attainder.

“ John, fon of Richard, fon of William, who bought the fame of John de Kirk- 
“ anders, fon and heir of John dc Parton, and Kirkanders, loih Edward 11 .
“ It is called Grinfdale, or Grcenfdale for that the town-field was anciently 
*' a low green bottom or dale by the river’s fide of Eden.” Denton’s MS.
A collateral branch of the Grinfdalcs were citizens of Carlifie : Robert de 
Grinfdale occurring reprefentative for that city in the parliaments of the 23d and 
33d of King Edward 1 .
Alan de Grinfdale, fon of Robert, was reprefentative in 
the 33d and 34th years of King Edward L and one of the knights of the fhire 6th 
King Edward II.
— Wefind one Robert de Grinfdale in the rolls of parliament in 
the reigns of King Edward II.
and King Edward III.
; but whether of the fame 
family, is net known.
About the year 1686, an anceflor of the Earl of Lonfdalc 
purchafed the eflate.
The Dacres became purchafers of Newton’s moiety of this manor; on whofe 
attainder.

attainder, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it came to the crown ; from whence^ 
being granted out, it became the efiate of Jofeph Dacre, of Kirklinton, Efq.* 
The church was rectorial, and dedicated to St. Mungo, or, as fome name this 
perfonage, Kentigcrn.
It was part of the ppfiefilons of Lanercoft priory, being 
given thereto by Hugh de Morvi!, Lord of Burgh, and Euftachia his wife ; and 
was foon after appropriated, the cure being ferv.ed by a brother of that houfe, with- 
out any vicarial endowment.
The redory and advowfon of Grinfdale paffed to 
Sir Thomas Dacre, with the other pofTclIions of the djlTolved monaflery, by the 
grant of King Edward VI.; and his defeendants have conflantly appointed a 
curate, with a falary of forty Ihillings yearly, to maintain their ecclefiaftical right, 
though the church lay in ruins for many ages; for it was not till about the year 
1743 that it was rebuilt by Jofeph Dacre, Efq. at his own cofl.
It has been three 
times augmented by lor, and the lands purchafed now produce about 30I.
a year.f 
— The church Bands pleafanily upon the banks of the Eden; and, being white, 
makes a very pretty appearance.— The Rev. Jofeph Pattinfon is the prefent 
curate.
The Studholmes alfo had a portion here, which they purchafed of the Lord of Kirkandrewa, ion 
and heir of John de Parlon and Kirkandrews, about the year 1336, and continued in that family for 10 
©r 12 defeents, and after that were fold out into feveral freeholds.
In 1747, this pariih contained about 22 families, i Quaker, 1 Prelbyterian ; in 1750, Itconfifled of 
18 houfes ; in 1781, of 15 houfes, containing 70 Inhabitants, — of whom one dies annually.
In this parifh are the remains of two old entrenchments, of a fquare form, upon the common, which - 
are yet v«i-y frelh.

Housman’s Notes.
Upon a rock between Grinfdale church and the river Eden, appear very plainly the footfteps of a 
human being.
— The perfon has been walking from the river northwards at the time, without doubt, 
when the nock has been in a foft ftatc.
— The ihoe or clog has been fliod with iron in the heel, as appears 
by the marks.

A not been a church landing at Kirkandrews for many years, but the burial

This parifh is

“ On a hill next unto Wormolby, is Beaumont; a town fo named of the fair

** which gave occafion to this name.
It was antiently a manor belonging to the

“ forth in cuRomary tenancies.

The Baron’s lands of Levington, where-

Meyrick, in Yorkfhire; but theadvowfon and right of prefenlation, with Beaumont,

* In thb parifh there was formerly an old church, at a place called Kirk-fteads, about a mile fout^ 
from the village of Kirkandrews.
— There is no account thereof, except a traditional one, which fays, 
that anciently the faid church ferved the inhabitants of Kirkandrews, Beaumont, Grinfdale, and Orton, 
before any otiier churches were built at thofe places ; and indeed the lituation feems to favour fuch an 
opinion, being pretty centrical to all the faid villages.
There is yet the appearance of the church-yard, 
in which freeilones, cunouOy carved, and hsman bones, have been frequently dug up of late years.— 
There is no account how long ago the faid church fell or was taken down ; but it muft no doubt have 
been very long fince, as the church built afterwards at Kirkandrews has now been in ruins a great number 
of years.
The boundaries of Kirkandrews are-foutb, the parilhts of St. Mary, Carlifle, and Orton ; weft.
Burgh ; 
north, Beaumont ; and call, Grinfdale On the north-eaft, it is feparated from the parifh of Stanw’ix 
by the river Eden, w'hich is here of the breadth of from 70 to 80 yards.
It contains only one quarter, 
and has no villages, except Kirkandrews and Hollcet-Hill ; the former containing 1 9 dwelling-^houfes, and 
73 inhabitants ; and the latter 3 houfes, vvith 1 1 Inhabitants.
Part of the lands are of freehold and part 
of cuftomary tenure.
The cullornary pays a twenty-penny fine, or two years’ improved value, at the 
will of the lord, on the death of the lord or tenant, and a thirty-penny fine, or three years’ improved 
value, on alienation.
I'he parilh Is tithe-free, on paying a prefcriptive rent, or yearly fum, to the patfon.
— There is a fchool 
at Kirkandrews, being the only one in the two paiilhes of Beaumont and Kirkandrews at this time, in ^ 
which from 20 to 40 fcholars are taught.
About 25 years ago, on opening a new gravel-pit, upon the common, in this parKh, a number of urns 
were found ; one of which contained a human Ikull, which however mouldered away on being expoYed to 
the air.
In the reft was nothing but a black fubftanee, fuppofed to have been afhes.

for mowing and pafturage.
It is frequently covered three or four times in a year.
The moft remarkable 
inundation in the memory of man, was in November, 1771, at the time of Solway mofs breaking out.

Before we leave the fea coaft, we (hall give a brief account in the notes,* (partly 
extraded from the Cumberland Pacquet, and partly from other information) of the 
moll tremendous llorms and high tides ever remembered by the oldeft perfons 
living, and their difallrous effeds along the weftern fliore of this county.
Thefc 
having happened lince our account of Whitehaven and the other fcaports, we 
think them worthy of a place here.
* Tremendous Storms, &c.
— Whitehaven.
— On Saturday 24th of 1796, (fays the editor 
of the Cumberland Pacquet ) we had one of tlic moft dreadful ftorms of wind and rain tliat ever was knows 
in this part.
The tide, from ten to eleven o’clock at night, rofe to a height never experienced fince 
1771, being not lefs than 22 feet at the end of the Old Quay ; a breach was made in the parapet of the 
New Qiyiy, near the fort.
Several of the heavy cannon were forced back upon the carriages.
The 
water overflowed the market-place and llvcets near the Quay, large logs of wood were fwept away from 
the yards, fome veflels broke from their moorings, many chimneys blown down, and houfes unroofed.
On Sunday, dutiiig the day, the weather was more moderate, but towards night another dreadful 
tempeft commenced ; a veflel belonging to New York was forced from her moorings, drove a fliore near 
Harrington harbour, and went to pieces ; but, providentially, all the crew were fared.
On Monday, 
about half pafl; ten in the forenoon, the tide again rofe much higher than on the two preceding days, 
more awful than any phaenomenon of the kind that had occurred for a century pail.
The mole, which extended from the Half- Moon Battery into the fea, was entirely deflroyed, and molt 
of the New Quay.
The New Tongue was much damaged ; much of the pavement in Marlborough- 
ftrect was loofened, and the ground waihed away from the foundations of many of the houfes ; the water 
was three feet deep on the Cuftom-Houfe Quay, broke into the king’s cellars, which did much damage : 
every' part of the harbour and fliipping received much injury.
At Parton, the quay was entirely demoliflied, two lioufes waihed down, and others much injured.
Some beautiful gardens adjoining the beach were entirely defolated and laid wafte.
— At Harrington, the 
quays were deflroyed, and the channel blocked up ; the rubbiih has fince been removed and the harbour

The (hipping there futfered conliderably.
A houfe at Salt-Pans was waihed down, and the 
houfehold furniture loft in the fea.
At Workington, there was much mifehief done, and fome damage among the fliipping in the river.— 
During the ftorm on Monday, two boys, who were launching a boat from near Mr. Falcon’s building- 
ground, were dragged into the water, and not being able to return, were fwept away by the tide acrofs 
the CloSbcks, and thrown aihore near the road leading to Marypott, without receiving any material 
injury.
The tide flowed as high as Seaton iron-works ; fome damage was done to Chapel-Bank colliery, 
and the water undermined a wall, by the fall of which one man was killed.
At Maryport, the damage done to the harbour was very great, confiderable lofs was fuftained by a 
Mr. Wood in his building-yard, and in a tan-yard near his.
The havock along the coaft to the north- 
ward was dreadful.
At Allonhy, the houfes near the fea received much damage.
The water broke into 
a fpirit cellar, and, by floating and Having the cailcs, occafioned great lofs to the owner.
At Skinburnefs, 
the hotel, fo much reforted to in the fea-bathing feafon, was moftly' fwept away : but it is now repaired.
At Sandsjield, a family had much difficulty to get out of their lioufe, and a great part of their furniture 
was loft.
At Rockliff, feveral houfes in the lower part of the village were fwept zwaj, and three families 
left deftitute.
Three large Hacks of corn w'ere floated over hedges, and, on the retiring of the tide, left 
Handing entire, a confiderable diftance from their former file, and nearly the fame diilance from each 
other, as before their removal.
At Beaumont, fix Hacks of wheat were removed by the wind and tide ; 
one of which was fet down entire ; the other five, on taking ground, went to pieces, and were much 
damaged with the water, though very little, if any, was taken entirely away.
In a word, it is impoifible 
to give a miirute detail of the damage done along the coaft, on both fides of Solway Frith, by the violence 
of the wind, which was from the weft, and the very high fwell of the tide, driven by the ftorm in the 
moft awful manner.

THE PARISH OF ARTHURET .
(in eskdale ward) 
D id anciently include much of the northern part of this county, before the 
parifii of Kirkandrcws was fevered there from.
It contains the barony of 
Lyddal, and confills of the following divifions, Efk, Arthuret, Stubhill, Carwin- 
law, Speerfykes, Randlinton, Efion, North Elion, Brackenhill, Nichol Foreft, and 
the Englifh part of the debareable lands.
The B arony of Lyddal was one of the allotments made by Ralph dc 
Mefchines to his dependants, and was by him granted to Turgent Brundey, faid 
to be a Fleming; King Henry I.
afterwards confirmed the fame.
It appears 
that this barony was a member of the honour of Dunftanburgh, in the county of 
Northumberland, which, in the View of Northumberland, we have Ihewn was 
part of the duchy of Lancafier : and probably (for we have nothing but conje(flure 
touching it) when King Edward III.
gave this barony,* which he had purchafed 
from the Earl of Kent, to John of Gaunt, he annexed it to Dunllanburgh, and made 
it a joint member therewith of the duchy of Lancafler.
Camden fays — " Where Lyd joins the Elke, flood formerly Lyddel Caftle, 
as 1 have been told, and a barony of the Efiotevilles, who held lands in cornagc, 
** which Earl Randulph (as we read in an old inquifition) gave to Turgis Brundas.
From Eftoteville, it defcended by inheritance to the Wakes, and by them to the 
Earls of Kent.
John Earl of Kent granted it to King Edward III.
and King 
Richard II.
to John of Gaunt, Earl of Laqcaftre.” 
By the efcheats of King John’s reign, we find this barony w'as become the pro- 
perty of the Stutcvilles : and Inch was that king’s dependence on William, one of 
this family, that he gave him the command of Northumberland, Cumberland, and 
Wefimofland, with the fupreme government of all their cafiles.

by purchafe from the Earl of Kent, obtained it: 
but the only fadl we have any degree of certainty in is, that either by the grant of 
King Edward III.
or King Richard II.
it was afluredly annexed to the duchy of 
Lancafter.
It doth not appear that thefe pofleflions pafled from the crown, till the time of 
King James 1.
when, by letters parent, dared 20 th February, in the firft year of his 
reign, he granted the foreft of Nichol, with the manors of Arthuret, Lyddal, and 
Radlington to George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, to be held of the crown in 
capita, under a rent of tool, and the twentieth part of one knight’s fee.
In this 
grant, it is expreffed, that the prernifes were parcel of the honour of Dunftan- 
burgh, and duchy of Lancafter.
It is obfervable, that, under this grant, the 
baronial rights did not pafs, but refted annihilated in the crown, and the manors 
were declared to be mefnes of the aforefaid honour.
On the banks of the Lydd, is a fquare tower of excellent mafonry, with a double 
ditch, called at this time Lyddal Strengi h.
It was taken by ftorm by William 
King of Scotland, in the beginning of his unfortunate campaign.* But, in the 
reign of David Brus, this fmall fort was made the feene of moil favage cruelty 
and unremitting revenge : in David’s incurfion previous to the battle of Durham,

but at length, defparing of relief, it was furrendered, in hopes of that mercy which 
has at all times diftinguifhed the brave, — it is the coward only, who delights in 
maflacre and bloodflied.
So far from granting the rights, of war, the tyrant feized 
the knight’s tw'o fons, and ftrangled them in the prefence of their father, who was 
then loaded with fetters; exulting in the excruciating mifery of a broken heart.
— 
He felt no other clemency towards his unhappy captive, than to Hiorten a parent’s 
wretchednefs, by oidcring his head to be cut off — in which the barbarian was 
immediately obeyed.
The great trad of country called 
THE DEBATEABLE LANDS, 
together with the advowfon of the church of Kirkandrews, were granted by King 
James I.
to Francis Earl of Cumberland, by letters patent, dated 31ft March, in 
the 8th year of that reign, under the yearly fee-farm rent of jjol.
They are 
deferibed to be boundering upon part of the fea called Solway fands towards the 
fouth, the river of Sarke towards the weft, the Scotch-Dyke towards the north, 
and the river of Elk towards the eaftjf containing 2895 acres of meadow and 
arable land, called Known Grounds ^ 400 acres of marih land, 2635 acres of pafture, 
and 1470 acres of mofty grounds ; in the whole 5400 acres.
place is fmall, rather of a circular form, ilrongly entrenched on tire weak fide : Iras before it a fort of 
half-moon, with a vail fofic and dyke, as a fecutiiy.
From this place to Netherby is the vcllige of a 
road.
That this fortrefs had been originally Roman is probable ; but fince their time has been applied 
to the fame ufe by other waiders.
“ It was,” fays Leland, “ the moted place of a gentleman cawled 
Syr Walter Scleby, the which was kylled there, and the place deftroyed yn King Edward the Thyrde 
tyme, when the Scoltes whent to Dyrham.”— — P ennakt.
•f The boundary of the- Dtbateablc I.and is thus deferibed in an old roll fet out in Gough’s Additions 
to Camden — “ Beginning at the loot of the White Sciyke til!
it con.c to a place called the Pyngillburne 
foot, running into the faid water of Scryke, and up the Pvngillhnrne till it come to Pyngillburne know, 
from thence to the Righcads, from the Righeads fo (be Mauke Riland Burnc, and from thence down to 
Hai venburne till it fall into Elke, and through Efke to the fool of Terras, and go up Terras to the foot 
of Rsygill, and up the Reygill to the Tophous, and fo to the (landing (lone and the Mearburne head, 
and down Meatburne to its fall in Lyddal at the Rutterford, and down Lyddal to its fall in Elke, and 
down Ellce to its fall in the lea.” — It was in length eight computed miles of the country, and in breadth 
four miles.
The fubjedts of bot’n kingdoms commonly depatlured thcii cattle on it in the day-time, but 
were to temove them before the fun fet, on the peril that was to enfue.
The following mention is made of this trafl of country i-n the introdudlion to Clarke’s Survey of the 
Lakes, written by Mr. Ritfon of Penrith — “ Tl.e real boundary was never known (before the fettlement 
in Edward VI.’s time) with certainty, on account of the Lnrmemoiial diforders which liad prevailed 
there, and even the antiquity of its being debateahlc was too remote for the longed lived tradition.
It 
is faid that this trifling piece of ground, from the mod trifling circumdances, had given birth to prodi- 
gious, and, if we refpedi the caul'es, adonifhing commotions between the two kingdoms } being the fink 
and receptacle of proferibed wretches v/ho acknowledged neither kingdom, obeyed the laws of neither 
country, and feared no punifliment ; that hence they grew to fuch a pitch of boldnefs as to live entirely 
on fpoils, to plunder each lide, having a'lured partners to ftiare their irregularities.
To finilh there- 
fore this evil, the foregoing boundar)'- was drawn by the confentof both, and pyramids of hewn done 
ereiSled, that the laws of each country might more precifely and effe£lually reach thefc villains : however 
their old habits were not thus eradicated even after the kingdoms had both one king, till King James I.
whetb-er or no to facilitate the journeys of his dun eonu is not recorded, made fome fort of a tranfportation 
9r difperfion of this fet of inhabitants, and fince that time the mifchlef has ccafed.” 
PARISH OF ARTHURET.

In the year 1552, by virtue of commflions from the fovereigns of England and 
Scotland, partition was made of the Debateable Lands between the two kingdoms; 
and the award fets forth — “ The inhabitants of the weftern part inclined more to be 
“ fubjects of England, and the inhabitants of the eaftcrn part to be fubjetfls of 
“Scotland:” therefore they awarded the wcftern part of the faid lands to the 
King of England, and the caltern part to the Queen of Scotland ; to be divided 
by a line drawn acrofs from Elk to Sarke, and a Iquare flone fet up at each end, 
with the arms of England on the welt thereof, and the arms of Scotland on the call 
fide.
And, left the ftones by evil pratftice, or length of rime, fiiould be deftroyed, 
or moved, they defcribcd the places where the ftones were to be fet, viz.
the ftone 
upon Elk, where the courfe of the river bends, on the weftern banks of a field 
called Dymmifdale, where Dymmifdale Syke comes in ; and the ftone upon Sarke 
to be at a red cliff in Kirkrigg, where alfo the water of Sarke makes a turn.
Thefe cxtenfive territories w'ere fold by Francis Earl of Cumberland, (who had 
fucceeded to the eftates granted to George, the former carl) to Sir Richard 
Graham ; and this fale was confirmed by King Charles I.
by his letters patent 
of the iith of July, in the 4th year of his reign; wherein Sir Richard was 
exonerated from one-half part of the referved rent of Nichol Foreft, and two- 
thirds of the rent of the Debateable Lands, the two rents being reduced to fifty 
pounds each.
Thefe poflefiions ftill remain in the family, the capital feat being at Nelherby.

Vifeount Prefton, of the kingdom of Scotland, by virtue of which creation 
he fat in the Scotch parliament, in 1685, he was reprefentative for the county of Cumberland.
He went ambaffador 
to the court of France, and on his return was made matter of the royal wardrobe, and fecretary of ftate to King James If.
Upon the revolution, he was fent to the Tow'er, merely on account of his attachment to the houfe of Stuart, and without 
any charge againft him ; fo that foon after affairs of ftate were got adjufted, he obtained his liberty : but, from a firm 
attachment to King James II.
he had determined to follow him to the continent ; to which purpofe, having made fecret 
preparations for his voyage, he got on board a ikiff, to pafs down the 'I hames as privately as pofliblc ; but being difeovered 
by the treachery of a fervant, he was intercepted, and committed prifoner to New'gate.
By due procefs of law, he was 
convifted of high treafon, and received fentence of death : hut, through a warm interccffion of friends, and the 
operation of a political degree of clemency, which the critical incidents of that time rendered the moft conciliatory 
rneafure the court could adopt, he received his pardon, and retired to Nunni’ngton, where he died in the year 1695.

He was buried in the chancel of the parifh church of Nunnington ; his tombftone inferibed, ‘‘ Here lies the body of 
“ Richard Graham, Vifeount Prefton, fon of George Graham, of Netherby, in the county of Cumberland, Baronet, 
“ who died the aid day of December, A- D.

whitened, have a remarkably beautiful cffecfl: upon the landfcape, as well as ferving

— “ The rivers Efl< and Levin, being firft joined, enter the

England, and receives the river Kirkfop, where were fixed not long fince the limits between the Engllfh 
and Scots, though it was not fo much the water as a mutual dread, (having had fufficient experience of 
each other’s valour) and now a mutual love, as being entirely united into one kingdom.
Upon this fpot

It is now the feat of the head of the family of Grahams, very famous among the

Nothing can afford greater plcafure to the liberal mind — the mind of one 
divclled of all party vehemence and ill-adopted prejudice, than the view of the fine 
country fpread around Netherby, — Tome tew years ago accurfed with the horrid 
names oi frontiers^ marches ^ and debat cable ground ; — a land of contention, rapine, 
blood filed, 
to be feen ^ and a total ignorance prevailed of even coal and lime.
His improving fpiiit foon wrought a 
great change in thefe parts : his example inftilled into the inhabitants an inclination to induftry : and 
they foon found the difference between (loth, and its concomitants, dirt and beggary, and the plenty that 
a right application of the arts of hufbandry brought among them.
They lay in the midlt of a rich 
country', yet ftarved in it; but in a fmall fpace they found, that, in'tead of a produce that hardly fiipported 
thcmfelves, they could even raife fupplics for their neighbours : that much of their land was fo kindly, as 
to bear corn for many years fucceflively without the help of manure ; and for the more ungrateful foils, 
that there were limeftones to be had, and coal to burn them.
The wild trad't foon appeared in form 
of verdant meadows, or fruitful corn fields : from the firft, they were foon able to fend to dillance places 
cattle and butter : and their dairies enabled them to fupport a numerous herd of hogs, and carry on a 
confiderable traffic in bacon ; their arable lands a commerce as far as Lancafhire in corn.

Eetter from Mr. Richard Goodman to Mr. Gale.
“ Sir, — Lafl week I went to Netherby, to view forne works that were lately difeovered.
You may 
pleafe to remember that there was a gradual defeent from the principal and oblong fort, on the north- 
weft angle, towards the river Eflc, in which there are feveral ftreets, very viitble ; in one of them, which 
runs north and foutli, on the weft fide, towards the rtver, by digging among the ruins for ftones, were 
two rooms difeovered, parallel to the ftreel ; the fouthernmoll of them is plainly a cold bath, from the 
cement and large thin flags laid at the bottom, and an earthen pipe at the north-weft corner defeending 
from a fmall w_ter-courfe that runs under ihe room and the partition wall, and fo below the door into 
the ftreet, where I prefume there may have been a commoi'i fhore.
The outward room has an entrance 
from the (Ireet, as above ; the dooi-checks are two large flags, of about feven feet high, and twenty 
inches broad, with holes in them for faftning the door, which opened into the ftreet.
In this room the 
altar was found, and now removed Into the caftle : they are ftiil at work, and I 'hall go over next week, 
and what elfe is found I will give you an account of, &c.”

I never had been before.
I know you have been there, therefore will not trouble you with any deferip-

neither without example, nor difficult to account for.
Solway-Mofs is lituatcd on 
the top of a pretty high hill, though not high enough to entitle it lo the name of 
a mountain, at lead in this country.
It extends for about three miles in length, 
and half that breadth.
The inner part of it fcems to have been nothing but a vafl 
Golleftion of mud, fo much diluted with the water of the fprings that feem to have 
been difperfed in feveral parts of it, as to have a conlidcrable degree of fluidity.
— 
It had always, even in the dried dimmers, fo much of a quagmire, that it was 
hardly fafe for any thing heavier than a fportfman to venture upon it.
— In the 
time of King Henry VH I.
a great part of the Scotch army, under the command 
of Oliver Sinclair perifhed in it: and it is laid, that, not many years ago, the 
Ikeleton of a trooper and his horfe vn complete armour was found in it by the people 
who were digging peats.
Hitherto the fhell of more folid earth was drong enough 
to redd the prefTure of the included mafs ; but the force, as well as the fluidity of 
the latter having been confidcrably augmented by the uncommon rains which fell 
the day before it broke out; and perhaps the fliell itfclf, in that part which is 
towards the eadern extremity of the mofs, being weakened by digging of peats 
for a great number of years, it made an opening on that fide, and immediately 
poured out a deluge of mud into the valley below.
This had not far to go before 
Each room is about nine or ten feet fquare ; the one is divided from the other by a thin partition of 
ftone, and both under the fame arched roof, which the woikmen broke down.
The outer room has 
ferved for a little temple, or Fmztan Fortunec, for in it the altar was found, of which I fend you the 
infeription.
In the fame room lay the heads of different animals, particularly oxen and Iheep.
The inner 
room it fcems was a bath, and in my opinion rather for a bathing veffel to ftand in than to be filled with 
water.
For though there is a certain cement, compofed of lime and beaten bricks, which covers both 
the floors and walls, and is indeed very hard, yet I have no notion it could ever hold water.
“ The floors of both rooms are covered with large flag Hones, and under them is an aqueduft, as I 
fuppofe, for there is a large empty fpace, or canal, which, reaches from end to end of the whole edifice.
“ It is remarkable that thefe floors, though handfome enough of tiiemfelvcs, are however covered, as T 
have faid, with the cement, about an inch and a half in thicknefs.
I fuppofe the reafon of this was, 
becaufe the ftones were too cold to Hand upon.
I believe it might be worth our while to imitate the 
cement in making floors below ground, for it feems the beaten brick, which is not very final!, ferved to 
bind up the moifture of the lime, and made it bind immediately.
“ From the infeription found on the altar, we may learn, that here the Spanifh horfe were, which I 
believe could not belong to the northern Exploratoret, coufeqiiently that this ilation was not the Cafira 
Exploratoruniy as Mr. Horfley took it to be, I make no doubt the true Cajira Expioratorum was at 
Middleby and B urn fiaake- Hall, in Scotland, ten rolies from Netherby.
For, as I noticed to you once 
before, and as the fame were likewife noticed by Mr. Gordon, that there are three Roman camps to 
defend thefe grounds, and from the top of the hill tlrere.is a profpedl of at lead; forty milesround.
I believe 
if poor Mr. Horfley had lived to fie this altar, he would like wifi have changed his c pinion about the 
place.
I do not know why it might not have been Luguvallium rather than Carlifle ; if the etymology 
of the word could be admitted to be Lcngovailis, which is a part which we call Efke-dale, or Efae vallis.
I own the next ftation of Antoninus’s Itinerary worrld create foine difficulty, but that would be only In 
the diftances, about which we can have but little certainty.
“ From the heads of animals found in the Fanum fortuna, we may griefs the priefts had picked them 
before they came there, otherwife the place had been a mere nafty daughter houfe.
The altar, no doubt, 
ferved for libations, or, according to the prieftcraft of thefe times, for a fmall part of the Fifceray while 
the holy men feaftedupon the reft themfelves.
“ I obferved on the pavement, fcattered about, feveral fragments of fine earthen pots, adorned with 
figures ; thofe, no doubt, have ferved for oils, or for the patera and prafirkuta .

it was at liberty to fpread itfelf on all fides over the fine plain which extends from 
the mofs to the river Efk. This happened in the middle of the night ; fo that the 
people in the villages were thrown, as you may fuppofe, into great confiernation, 
not being able till the morning to conjed:ure what had happened.
Some were 
roufed by the uncommon noife it made, and others not till it entered their houfes, 
or even, as I am told was the cafe with feveral, till they found it in their beds.
— 
Nol ives however were loff; which you are to underfiand of human lives, for a 
great many cattle that w'ere houfed were deflroycd.
The cafe of a cow belonging 
to Mrs. Graham, of the Lake, is remarkable enough to deferve to be particularly 
mentioned.
She was the only one of eight in the fame byer that was laved, after 
having flood fixty hours up to the head in mud.
When flie was got out, Ihe did 
not refufc to eat ^ — but water (lie would not tafle, nor could even look at without 
horror, and difeovering all the fymptoms of hydrophobia.
She is lince, 1 hear, 
reconciled to it, and likely to recover.
— The villages you are not to fuppofe fo 
large as villages generally are ; they confifl only of a farm-houfc and tw’o or three 
cottages.
One or two of them have entirely difappeared under the mud ; of others 
nothing but the roof is to be feen ; and all of them, to the number of thirteen or 
fourteen, are rendered uninhabitable.
— The valley into w hich the mofs firft dif- 
charged itfelf is filled up to a depth fuppofed to be between thirty and forty yards ; 
fora farm-houfe called Hilltop, which flands upon a hill, as they told me, not 
lefs than that height, is now half funk in the mud.
— The greatefl part of the plain 
confiflcd of fine and fertile inclofures, and the hedges were all planted with thorns, 
which were grown to the height of eight or nine feet above the ground ; nothing 
of which is now to be feen, except near the extremities, where the inundation, or 
rather the incoenation, has but lately reached.
It is fuppofed to have covered near 
a thoufand acres of the fincfl corn ground in this country, and is flill proceeding 
farther.
— The road too has been fome time overflowed with the water w'hich 
drains from it : and that to Annan is, within thefefew days, adlually covered with 
the mud, fo as to be impaflable, and is now very near the Efk, and if it fliould 
flow into it in very large quantities, it is not very eafy to forefee the confequencc.
The mofs itfelf, before this happened, was a level plain, but is now a deep valley, 
with a little river of liquid black peat-earth running with a confiderable current 
through the midfl of it, the furface gradually fubfiding as the mud whfch fupported 
it is difeharged ; and, as it fubfides, is broken into large fragments, which, in 
fome places, being irregularly thrown together in all diredlions, refemble a heap 
of ruins.
Some of them fall into the flreara, and floating down with it, flill

The defeat of the Scots here In 1543 is moft memorable ; and is thus related by 
the noble hiftorian of Henry VIII.
Lord Herbert of Cherbury —

of King Henry Vlll.
A. D.

— It is not confiftent with our plan in this work 
to enter into a hiftorical review of the facitions which reigned in the court of 
Scotland, or the feditions which diftraded their councils, when the Scotch army 
retired 
** Thcfc, being charged by fome of the Scots, retired towards their Rate, and to Wharton, who now firfl 
“ appeared ; though he had not yet above 300 men, ss our writers fay.
Wbaefoever the ftratagem was, 
“ the Scots believing, it ftems, the Duke of Norfolk was there with all his power, fuddenly, as men 
“ amazed, fled.
The Englithmcn putfued, and took the EarU of Caflcls and Gkncairne, Lord Somerville, 
“ Lord Olipliant, Lord Grey', and Sir Oliver Sinclere, the king's minion, (as our hiltorians term him) 
“ and divers others of note, to the number of two hundred and above, and eight hundred of the meaner 
fort, (fo that fome had two or three pii.foners) and twenty-four pieces of ordnance, with much arms 
“ and baggage.
The Scottifh writers tell the bufmefs a little otherwife ; confefling yet the aforefaid prifoners to be 
‘‘ taken, and that their men ran away, and were defeated.
But fome fay, the reafnn of it was, that Sir 
“ Oliver Sinclere being fuddenly declared their general, when the Engiilh appeared, the nobles took it 
“ fo ill, that they cated not to fight.
They fay alfo, that the king was at Solway (where this encounter 
“ happened) a little before, and no further off than Caerlavrock, when the blow was given : which per- 
“ haps made fome think, that he was prefeat at the fight, and received a wound, of which prefently after 
he died, and not of forrow.” 
The traditional tale of a whole troop of horfe being engulphed and fvvallovved up in the mofs, which 
Mr. Gilpin fays is now authenticated, we are under the neceflityof ftill confideriug as frivolous.
No man 
and horfe in complete armour either are, or ever were, preferved by any baronet, or other perfon, of the 
name of Maxwell, as far as we can leatn, after a very careful enquiry.
Bones, coins, utenfils of various 
forts, and Immenfely large trees have indeed, as Dr. Todd relates, frequently been dug out of the mofs ; 
and we have in our own pofleffion a very perfeft Roman Britifh Tripodal veflel, the exaiSf counter part 
of one that Is delineated in Mr. Weft, s map of Furnefs, which he fays was found at Urfwick, in Furnefs, 
in 1774- Ours was got out of Solway-Mofs, not long after, by the late Dr. Mowett of Longtown.
Mr. Gilpin’s talents of defeription are fo juft, that we Ihould deem It almoft a piece of injuftice to 
our readers, not to extraft his account of the wonderful irruption of this mofs in 1771 ; it is admirable, 
as a piece of fine writing, and is alfo, as far we have been able to learn, fufficiently accurate ; 
“ On the i6th of November, 1771, in a dark tempeftuous night, the Inhabitants of the plain were 
alarmed with a dreadful cralh, which they could in no way account for.
Many of them were then 
“ abroad in the fields, watching their cattle, left the Elk, which was rifing violently in the ftorm, Ihould 
carry them oft.
None of thofe miferable people could conceive the nolfe they heard to proceed from 
any caufe, hut the overflowing of the river in fame lhape, though to them unaccountable.
Such Indeed 
“ as lived nearer the fource of the eruption, were fenflbk that the noife came In a different diredion; hut 
were equally at a lofs for the caufe.
In the mean time, the enormous mafs of the fluid fuhftance, which had burft from the mofs, moved 
** flowly on, fpreading Itfelf more and more, as it got poffeffion of the plain.
Some of the inhabitants, 
through the terror of the night, could plainly difeover it draining, like a moving hill — and not very 
unlike, as he might fince have added, thofe moving pillars or iflands of land in the deferts of Arabia, fo 
well defcribed by Mr. Bruce.
— “ This was In fad the cafe ; for the gufli of the mud carried before it, 
through the firft two or three hundred yards of its courfe, a part of the breaft-work ; which, though 
low, w'as y«t feveral feet in perpendicular height.
But it foon depofited this folid mafs, and became a 
heavy fluid.
One houfe after another, it fpread round — filled — and ciuflied into ruin ; juft giving time 
“ to the terrified inhabitants to efcape.
Scarce any thing was faved, except their lives : nothing of their 
“ furniture !
few of their cattle.
Some people were even furprized In their beds, and had the additional 
** diftrefs of flying naked from the ruin.
“ The morning light explained the caufe of this amazing feene of terror ; and Ihcwed the calamity in 
** its full extent : and yet, among all the conjeftures of that dreadful night, the mifehief which had really 
« happened, had never been fuppofed.
Who could have imagined, that a brcaft.work, which had flood

retired from Fala-Moor, without effe(flingany thing againft England; it is enough 
to premife, that, in order to remove the chagrin of King James V.
and gratify 
his fpleen againft the Englifli, it was determined to make an inroad by the Weftern 
Marches; the condudl of which was recommended to the Lord Maxw'ell.
An 
army 
“ for ages, fliould at length give way ?
or that thofe fubterraneous floods, which had been bedded In 
“ darknefs, lince the memory of man, fliould ever burft from their black abode ?
“ This dreadful inundation, though the firft fhock of it was the mod tremendous, continued ftlll fpread- 
“ ing for many weeks, till it covered the whole plain, — an area of 500 acres ; and like molten metal pour- 
“ ed into a mould, filled all the hollows of it, lying in fome parts thiity or forty feet deep, reducing the 
“ whole to one level iurface.
The overplus found its way into the Eflc ; where Its quantity was fuch, 
“ as to annoy the fifh ; no falmon, during that feafon, venturing Into the river.
“ On this well-cultivated plain, twenty-eight families had their dwellings and little farms ; every one of 
“ which, except, perhaps, a few who lived near the Hurts of It, had the world totally to begin again,” — 
Our author, mifled it would feem by fome illiberal and Ignorant Informer, aflerts, that Dr. Graham, 
agreeably to the prudential maxims he has ever ohfetved, afforded the tenants little afGftance in repairing 
their Ioffes.
We are bold to affirm, on the contrary, that every Inch of the giound, thus almoft mlra- 
culoufly deftroyed, has been and is totally recovered, at the expence of the Netherby family : and, in 
defiance of Mr. Gilpin’s gloomy apprehenlion, is at this moiTient waving with the richeft harvefts.
The regaining of this paradife was effefted almoft folely by the fleill and unequalled abilities of an old 
plain Yorkfhire man, of the name of John Wilfon.
This man was one of thofe felf-taught philofophers j 
fuch, as there is reafon to believe, are oftener to be met with in thofe remote regions, than in countries where 
there is lefs fcope and lefs neceffity for their exertion.
Like Edwards, the celebrated architeft of the 
Pont-y-prydd, in Glamorganfhire, Wilfon was perfeAly illiterate : but he poffeffed fuch ftrength and 
Vigour of natural underftanding, as to be unrivalled in his day for ingenuity in draining, banking, &c.
One remarkable inftance of this his fkill is recorded by Mr. Gilpin — “ The houfe at Netherby ftands 
** on an emmence, with higher grounds about it.
A Tittle on the fide of the front flood a knoll, which 
“ made a difagreeable appearance before the windows.
Being defirous therefore of removing it, he fent 
” to Newcaftle for a perfon accuftomed to works of this kind.
The undertaker came, furveyed the 
ground, and eftimated the cxpence at 
" While the affair was ia agitation.
Dr. Graham heard, that Wilfon had faid, the earth might be 
“ removed at amucheafier rate.
He was examined on the fjbjedl ; and his anfwers appeared fo rational, 
** he was fet to the w'ork.
He had already furveyed the higher grounds, where he firft collefled all the 
“ fprings he found into two large refervoirs ; from which he cut a precipitate channel, pointed at an 
•* abrupt corner of the knoll.
He cut alfo a channel of communication between the refervoirs Thefe 
“ bemg both filled, he opened his fluices, and let out fuch a torrent of water, (the upper pool feeding 
“ the lower) that he very foon carried away the corner of the knoll, againft which he had pointed his 
“ artillery.
He then charged again and levelled againft another part with equal fuccefs.
In fhort, by a 
** few efforts of this kind, he carried away the whole hill ; and told Dr. Graham, with an air of triumph, 
“ that, if he pleafed, he would carry away his houfe next.
The work was completed in a few days ; and 
“ the whole cxpence did not amount to twenty pounds.” 
He cleared ail the grounds overflowed by the Solway-Mofs, by a plan formed on the fame principles ; 
“ From the refervoirs formed by a little ftream at the highett part of the overflowed ground, he cut 
“ channels in various diredlions to the Elk : and when the water was let off, he placed numbers of men 
“ by the fide of the ftream, who rolled into It large maffes of moffy earth, which were hardened by the 
“ fun.” — By this Cmple but fenfiblc contrivance, which he called hajhing, in due time, this extraordinary 
man carried away thoufands and thoufands of loads of this extraneous matter ; and all the plain is now 
once more In as good order and tilth, as if no fuch aftonllhing event had happened.
With all this genius, and all this judgment, this truly great man (fo mixed are all human charafters) 
was debafed by one of the moft degrading of vices — he was a confirmed drunkard ; and ebriety in him 
was not foftened by any of the ufual pleas that are offered in execufe of it.
He did not drink to drown 
care, nor to promote hilarity ; but merely to gratify an animal appetite.— Yet he preferved his faculties,

army of ten thoufand chofen troops were appointed for this fervice, and were 
marched to the rendezvous with the utmoft fecrecy and expedition.
In order to 
amufe the borderers.
Cardinal Beaton and the Earl of Arran raifed their levies in 
the ufual manner for the recruit of the army, and public orders W'ere iflued for 
their being arrayed near the Eaftern March.
The king, whole fervent wrath fired 
his mind with ideas of glory in this expedition, gave liberty for moft of his 
domeftics to attend the inroad, he placing himfelf at Carlaverock Caftle, within 
twelve miles of the borders, in order to receive the earlieft intelligence of the 
glorious fpoils, for which his fplenetic bofom burnt with impatiencey.
It mull 
be owned there was a flattering profpccfl of the fuccefs of this enterprize, the 
Englilh being lulled in an unfurpicious fecurity, and deluded by the falle movements 
made on the eaflcrn fide of the kingdom, left the Wellern March undefended, but 
by the provincial troops of Cumberland.
The king had fent upon this expedition 
his favourite, Oliver Sinclair, a minion deteftable to his nobles ; he had given 
with him a fecret commilTion of lieutenant and general of his army, which was 
not opened, or made known to the troops, till the inftant a body of the Englilh 
appeared in view; when he was elevated on two pikes, to Ihew him to the Scotch 
battalia, as the leader.
A general murmur of dilTafisfadiion inftantly ran through 
the ranks ; the chieftains broke out into violence and tumult, and confulion enfued.
A very confidcrable body of the Cumberland horle, under the command of Dacrcs 
and Mufgraves, which appeared on the flanks of the little army of Englifh, which 
was drawn up with great order and regularity with advantage on a diftant 
eminence, were leen to move forw'ard, as intending to begin the attack : this did 
hot induce the leaders of the Scotch army to bring the troops into order, but 
mutiny and uproar filled the irregular multitude ; which the Englilh perceiving, 
they made a rapid march, and began a brilk attack on the broken and difordered 
enemy, who fell, as was natural to expedt, a defencelefs prey to their foes.
The 
prifoners were very numerous, and multitudes threw down their arms, difdain- 
ing to fight under fo contemptible a leader, and preferring captivity with a gener- 
ous enemy, before an inglorious fervice with Sinclair, and a flight to their own 
country, w here they Ihould meet the rage of their w'eak and difappointed fovereign.
Among the prifoners were the Earls of Calllls and Glencairn, the Lords Somerville, 
Maxwell, Gray, Oliphant, and Fleming, Robert, fon of Lord Erlkine, Henry, 
brother of Lord Maxwell, John Lefley, fon of the Earl of Rothes, with upwards 
of an hundred and fifty other gentlemen.
James was overw helmed w ith confulion and grief at rhe news of this difafler; 
he aferibed the ill event wholly to the fadlious fpirit of the nobles ; and though he 
was in the prime of life, and polTelTed of a vigorous conftitution, the vexation and 
and enjoyed good health to a good old age.
He was tall and port'y ; and a fine figure of a man ; but 
of a lefcrved and uniocial temper, and ungracious manners.

The lituation rendered this church fubjedt to innumerable injuries in the border 
wars, fo that, before its eredtion in 1609, it was a low and mean edifice.f In the

crofs of the knights of Malta; and it is probable it was eredfed by one of that 
order.
In the fame ground were interred the remains of poor Archy Armftrong, 
jefler or fool to King Charles 1 .
; — and, by accident, fuitable to his profefiion, the

Archy had long fliot his bolt with great

weaknefs beneath his charadler and rank, procured an order of council, the king 
priTent, for degrading the fool, by piilling his motley coat over his head, dif- 
charging him the king’s fervice, and banilhing him the court.
When the news 
arrived at court of the tumult in Scotland, occalioned by the attempt to introduce 
the liturgy, a p'rojedl of Laud, Archy unluckily met w itti the archbilhop, and had 
the prefumpdon to afk his grace, “ IVho's fool no’vo?'’X — added by fome 
writers, “ that Archy was a native of this parifh, and was jefter to King James as

Line, which extends on the former above Netherby, and the latter to the Breckonhill, and may confti-

Extent.
3 From eail to weft, including NIchul Foreft, about feven miles and a half, and breadth, 
aliout three miles.
Soil and Produce.] Iftie foil is various ; alpng the river Efle is fine holm land, In fijme parts half 
a mile, in others a mile broad and nfore, and exceedingly fertile.
Oa the borders of Sark are fome 
narrow ftripes of fine holm land.
In the interior parts are forae finall pieces of good croft land, or ancient 
iaclofures.
On the eaft fide of the river Elk. at High and l,.ovv Mote, are confiderable quantities o£ 
holm land, level and fertile.
A great part however of this pariTh was lately improved, Is fituated high 
and cold, of a wet whitilh clay, and produces (lender crops of oats.
— Eaft of the Solway-Mofs is alfo a 
parcel of land of confiderable extent, lately cultivated ; fome of which anfvvers well j but in general is 
barren, and naturally not improveab’e : it lies level and rather high ; the hedges are bare.

furface, to the S.

E. I could not forbear conceiving, whilll I viewed the place, that a caiife 
limilar to that which produced the late overflow, may again produce even more dire effects.
Woods.] Near the E.
end of the Scotch Dyke, Sir James Graham planted, lately, about 30 acres 
with fir.
— On the front of the Solway-Mofs, towards Netherby, are fome plantations of fir, but do not 
thrive well; they may contain about 100 acres.
Hedges, except towards the marfh, are pretty well 
furailhed with trees.
Sheep and Cattle.] Few of the former ; the latter are a mixture of the Cumberland and Galloway 
breed, very heavy ; a cow will frequently fell here for lol.
even year olds will, in fome parts of this parifh, 
reach 3I.
los.
The young cattle are, in general, put out of the pariflr to grafs in fummer.
Wages.] Are 8d.
per day, with viftuals, for labourers in hufbandry, &c.
except in harveft when they 
fometimes advance to lod.
or even is.
Fuel.] Is chiefly peat ; to^vards the E.
part, a few coals are burnt.
Game.] Moor-game, partridges, and hares ; the laft of which, perhaps, abound more here than In any 
other part of Cumberland.
Trade and Commerce.] Here is a fmall harbour at Sarhfoot, erefted, I believe, by the predeceflbr 
of the prefent Sir James Graham, where are imported confiderable quantities of fir wood, foreign corn, 
and fome other articles.
There being a mill erefted near Netherby of a very fuperior conflrudflon, great 
quantities of flour are frequently made there, and (hipped for the weft coaft of England, to Lancafter, &c.
Roads.] A principal road leads from Carllfle to the weft of Scotland, as alfo one to Edinburgh, both 
in good repair.
Rivers.] Are Sark and Eflc, with feveial fmall brooks.
Quarries.] A good freeftone quarry at Glingerburn, near the Scotch Dyke* 
Air.] The air here is falubrious, and the people live long.
An inftance of longevity is now exhibit- 
ed In the perfon of Mary Little of Bankhead, who was, when I viewed the parlfh in 1 792, near i n 
years of age, and retained the perfeft ufe of her fenfes till fome ftiort time before.
Cultivation of Land.] Is here in tolerable pcrfedlion, efpeciallyin large farim.
— Clover and grafs 
feeds are fown here, with barley.
— In general, agriculture, in this and Arthuret parllh, is much upon the 
advance, and has been fo for fome time paft.
Poor.] Aie fupported by a rate of is.
per pound.
Tithes.] A prefcrlptive payment of 2s.
In the pound in fatisfaftion of tithes.
Schools ] In this and .‘\rthuret parHh are eight fchools, four In each, all of vvhich have a fmall falary 
annexed to them by Sir James Graham, exclufive of the fcholars wages : this bounty, it is fald, originated 
from fome former proprietors of Netherby.
In each parifii Is a central fchool, the annual allowance to 
which is about lol.
each, to the other 4I.
Farais.] Are from lol.
to 300!.
a-year.
Buildings.] A few buildings belonging to great farms, efpeclally thofe near the roads, are good, or 
rather bordering on magnificence.
The whole of KIrkandrews, as well as Nichol Foreft and Arthuret, is 
the property of Sir James Graham, except a fmall quarter of Arthuret, called Breckonhill, which latter 
bei ngs to Howland Stephenfon, Efq. Banker in London.
Manners of the Inhaeitants.] Under this head we find fomething peculiar; their uniform de- 
pendence on the fame perfon, and uncertainty of their continuance in the fame place, produces a fimilarity 
of manners, very oppofite to the unbending fpirit fo remarkable in thofe pariflies, where almoft every little 
farm is occupied by its owner, in whofe family it hath continued for, perhaps, fcveral centuries.
Here the 
people affe£l to have all one mind, and to aft with fuhfeiviency to their fuperiors In every circumftance.

watches were kept along the whole 
border, and at every ford, by day and night : fetters, watchers, fearchers of the 
watchers, and overfeers of the watchers were appointed.
Befides thefe cautions, 
“ the inhabitants of the Marflies were obliged to keep fuch a number oi Jlough- 
dogSy or what we call blood-hounds : for example — In thefe parts beyond the 
Ejky by the inhabitants there were to be kept above the foot of Sark one dog.
Item^ 
“ by the inhabitants of the infide of E/k to Richmond Clugh, to be kept at the Moat^ 
one dog.
Iteniy by the inhabitants of the parifh of Arthuret, above Richmond Clugh ^ 
to be kept at ike Barley-head one dogy and fo on throughout the bo>der .”\ — The chief 
olhcers, bailiffs, and conftables throughout the diftridl being direded to fee 
“ that the inhabitants kept their quota of dogs, and paid their contributions for 
“ their maintenance.
Perfons who were aggrieved, or had loft any thing, were 
“ allowed to purlue the hot trode with hound and horn, with hue and cry, and all 
other accuftomed manner of hot purfuit.
The neceffity of all this was very ftrong ; for before the acceffion of King 
James I.
to thefe kingdoms, the borders of both w'ere in perpetual feuds : after 
that happy event, thofe that lived by hoftile excurfions took to pillaging their 
neighbours ; and about that period got the name of Mofs-Troopers, from their 
** living in the moiTes of the country.
“ They w’ere the terror of the limits of both kingdoms; at one time tliey amount- 
**  ed to fome thoufands; but by the feverity of the laws, and the adivity of Lord 
William Howard, were at length extirpated.
The life and manners of one of 
the plundering chieftains, are well exemplified by the confeflion of Geordie Bourne^ 
a noted thief, who fuffered when Robert Cary, Earl of Monmouth, was warden of 
one of thefe Marches : he fairly acknowledged, " that he had lived long enoughy to do 
fo many vill antes as he had done ; that he had layne with above forty men's wives y what 
in England what in Scotland; that he had killed feven Englijhmen with his own 
“ hands y cruelly murdering them ; that he had fpent his whole time in whoring y drinkingy 
*tfealingy and taking deep revenge for flight offences.
" Among the various cuftoms now’ obfolete, the moft curious was that of hand- 
“ iijiingy in ufe about a century paft.
In the upper part of Efkdale, at the 
confluence of the White and Black Efk, was held an annual fair, where multi- 
“ tildes of each fex repaired.
The unmarried looked out for mates, made their 
« engagements by joining hands, or by band-fijlingy went off in pairs, cohabited till 
** the next annual return of the fair, appeared there again, and then were at liberty 
** to declare -their approbation or diflike of each other.
If each party continued 
Uiefe matters as he pleafes : in Ihort, content appears here to have as much footing as In moft other pa- 
rlfties in the county, though perhaps from different caufes.
Upon the whole, thefe parifhes form a moft 
extenfive and beautiful eftate, the value of which Is improving every year.
Housman’s Notes.
Since the above furvey was made, Sir James has given all his extenfive tenants frefli leafes for ly years, 
which has Increafed his rent-roll very con fiderably ; but as a convincing proof they are not too high 
rented, not one of all his numerous tenants have quitted their farms.
The certainty of the farmer reaping 
the benefit of his improvements is already beginning to ftiew its good effefts.

* The etymology of this place Is obvioufly the Church (anciently and properly always pronounced 
hard every where, as it now is only in the north) of St. Andrenu.
Its boundaries are defcribed in Burn 
and Nicolfon’s Hiftory : where alfo the remarkable circumftance of the lad parifh of EJlon is recorded.
Its length, from eaft to weft, is upwards of twenty miles ; but it is no where more than four broad— 
The church is an elegant modern ftrudlure, of red freeftone, covered with blue flate : and ornamented 
with an handfome cupola at the fouth end.
It w’as built by the late Dr. Graham ; and ftands on the 
north bank of the Efle, oppofite to Netherby.

Nichol Foreft lies to the eaft j and the other quarters to the weft of It, and of each other, as 
here arranged.
Of this accurate ftatement of population.
It may be remarked, that it is on thg increafe.
— It deferves 
notice alfo, that each family here, in the aggregate, confifts of more than five perfons ; at which number- 
it is ufual to calculate families.
The river Eflc, juft after its conflux with the Liddell, enters this paridi a little above the church ; and 
feparates It from Arthuret and Rockliff.
It falls into the Frith at the weft end of the parifli.
Here 
too, where the little river Sark (which is there the boundary line between England and Scotland) empties 
itfelf into the Frith, there is the little port of Sark foot ; which is likely, ere long, to become more con- 
fiderable, as veffels of 60 or 70 tons burthen, and, in high tides, of icd tons burthen, may fafely anchor 
there.
Sir James Graham has two large and itroft convenient wareboufes here ; and confiderable quan- 
tities of timber, tar, iron, flate, and lime, together with various articles of merchandize, are imported at 
this place.
Near the eafiern extremity of the parifli Is a remarkably fweet and romantic fpot, called Penton Lin, 
or Panton-Hills, which is by no means unworthy the notice of perfons of tafte and curiofity.
The 
rJver Liddell, winding through fome charming dales, and fldrted by fome grotefque copfy thickets, be.dded 
with a kind of flooring or pavement of flaty rock, rolls its rapid ftream, with infinite grandeur, in many 
fine cafcadcs.
over lundry huge rocks and precipices.
In the bed of the river, not far frona its brink, and 
of courfe eafily approachable when the river is low, there arifes a pretty plentiful fpring, ftrongly impreg- 
nated with allum.
What its other qualities are, as it has never been fubjefted to a chemical analyfis, we 
are unable to fay : but it has undoubtedly been fold as the water of the Hart fell fpa.
This is the 
fine paftoral country, which gave birth to the poet Armfrong, who w’as fon to the minifter at Cannobie, 
In Scotland, and an attentive reader of his charming poems, who is acquainted with the various enchant- 
ing fpots to be found on the banks of the Liddell, may trace the alliifions to it in many of them.
In November, 1783, a large body of diforderly men, to the number of at lead 200, confifting chiefly 
of the militia who had been difbanded from the Duke of Buccleugh’s regiment of South Fencibles, 
aflembled at Langholm, and (moft of them with arms In their hands) marched acrofs the Efk near 
Netherby ; to redrefs, by force, an injury of which they had long complained.
This was the flopping 
the falmon in their progrefs up the river by the ftrong dam thrown acrofs the whole river, to fupply the 
Netherby mills with water.
This, however unintentional, was doubtlefs injurious to all thofe who lived 
near 
PARISH OF KIRKANDREWS.

In mentioning Netherby, it is impofiible not to attempt paying our tribute of 
refpetft to the memory of the late Dodbor Graham, to whofe foltering hand is 
principally to be afcribed the prefent flouriihing fituation of this part of Cum- 
berland.
At the time when he fucceeded to the eflate, the greatefl; part of thofe who 
lived upon it, from accidental circurnftances, were conliderably behind the reft of 
England in civilization and induftry.
The adb of union had, indeed, put an end 
to the dreadful fcenes of blood and rapine, which for lo many ages had hairafled 
the borders, but the ideas of thofe fcenes were ftill frefh in the minds of the people ; 
fome of the adlors in them were, perhaps, yet alive; and it cannot be imagined 
that fuch perfons, habituated from infancy to war and plunder, or even their chil- 
dren, continually hearing of the exploits of their fathers, could fuddenly fink down 
into the peaceful condition of hufbandrnen or artizans.
Hence agriculture was confidered not as a fource of v/ealth, but merely as a 
means of exiftence, and other employments were reforted to, more congenial to the 
inclinations of the inhabitants.
Unhappily, the ftaje of the country at that time, 
afforded but too eafy a mode of employing themfelves as they wifhed : the heaths 
in Efkdale abounded with game ; and the vicinity of the Ifle of Man, then under 
a feparate jurifdidlion with the reft of the kingdom, held out a ftrong temptation 
to illicit traffic.
The confequences are obvious : their hours were devoted, either 
to the unprofitable amufements of the field, or to the pernicious prablice of fmug- 
gling ; while they were thus immerfed in idlenefs or vice, they could give little 
attention to their farms or their families : and hence, the whole of this fine country 
exhibited nothing but the appearance of neglecft and barrennefs, and its inhabitants 
that of profligacy and want.
Upon Doebor Graham’s coming to the eftate, he determined to make a radical 
reform ; he fet out upon a fyftem, and to that fyftem he invariably adhered.
To influence the manners of the tenants whom he found upon the eftate, 
he fhewed by an uniform line of condud, that iazinefs or vice Ihould have no- 
thing to hope for from him ; but that induftry and honefty might, upon all 
occaflons, be fecure of his ]»rote(5bion and indulgence ; he ftrove to diicourage that 
near the river, but higher up ; and the Scotch had twice before attempted to pull it down, by violence ; 
but had been repelled by the Netherby tenants with all the fpirit and animofity of ancient limes.
As 
so perfons of property or weight took any part in this infurredlion, fome magilhates and gentlemen on 
the EnglKh fide, by mild expoftuhtions, fettled the matter- amicably.
The river was widened ; fo that 
while the mills ftill have all the benefit of the dam, a paftage is now opened for the fifh to go up and 
come back again, as formerly.
It muft not be omitted to mention, that the Duke of Bue.cleugh, whofe tenants the infurgents were, 
was totally Ignorant of their defigns : and when he heard of it, difeouraged it fo efftdlually, that there is 
good reafon to hope, nothing of the kind will ever be thought of again.
The Duke of Buccleugh’s 
eftate In the fouth of Scotland is faid to be in length 47 miles, and in breadth 31,5 ; in all j48o,^5 
fquare miles ; containing 947520,0 acres.
We believe, there is not fuch another landholder in the king, 
dom : we are fure there is not a better landlord.
The EHc abounds with falmon, gilfe, and whitings : which (though W'C are not infenfible that good 
judges think dififerently) we are perfuaded, are all falmon, of different ages, and in different circum- 
ftances.

litigious fpirit, which will always be met with-amongft the refllefs and idle; and 
took every means in his power, to put an end to thole diferders which local ciiw 
cumflanccs had h*eighrened or produced.
To inftil into the rifing generation, more induftrious habits and more proper 
fentiments, he bellowed every attention upon the fchools eftabiiihed in different 
parts of the effate, to which the tenants were expeeffed to fend their children re- 
gularly ; and in a few years he had tlie fa tis faction of feeing upwards of five 
hundred young perfons conffantly inffruded at them.
To place in the moft ffriking light, the advantages of a mode of cul- 
tivation different from the one then pradifed, he annually took confiderable trads 
of land under his own management, and by employing perfons really fkilful in 
the bufinefs, brought his grounds into fuch a ffate of fertilization, as could not 
but excite the attention of his tenantry; and thus, during the time he held the 
effate, upwards of five thoufand acres of waffe lands were converted into paffures 
and corn fields; every exertion on the part of his tenants to follow his example 
was eagerly feconded by him ; he encouraged them by every inducement to pradife 
greater neatnefs, to exhibit greater adivity, and to'profecute their agricultural 
purluits upon a more enlarged plan.
As his farms- became vacant, he rebuilt the 
houfes and offices in a more fubftantiaTmanner, fUrrounded the fields with fuffi- 
cient fences, and obliged the new occupier to keep the whole in a proper condition.
He raifed the rents indeed, but it was gradually and judicioufly, and in fuch a 
- manner as only to operate upon the farmer as a ffimulus to greater pundualityj 
and more conftant attention; a certain proof of which' is, that notwithftanding 
the increafed rents, fcarce one old tenant of- any refpedability quitted his farm.
For the convenience of the neighbourhood, he ereded corn mills upon an extenfive 
fcale, w'here every farmer was lure of an immediate fale for the grain w'hich he had 
in hand.
He patronized, with equal judgment and fuccefs, the- markets and 
buildings at Longtown; and by conffruding the little harbour at Sarkfoot, he 
afforded to all the people an cafy means of exporting their fuperfiuous produce, 
and of importing whatever they might findmecefiary for themfelves.
Thefe were fome of the methods ufed by Dodor Graham for the improvement 
of his effate, and their effeds w§re fully anfwerable to his moft fanguine expeda- 
tions.
Inftead of an half cultivated w'afte, he lived to fee his property affume the ap- 
pearance of a rich and fertile domain, provided with roads and adorned w'ith 
plantations.
Inftead of the miferable hovels and poor village that once disfigured his pro* 
fped, he faw comfortable dv/elling houfes, and a neat market-town.
The rent- 
roll of the effate was more than quadrupled, and yet the wealth of the tenants was 
increafed in a ftill higher proportion.

changed from loofe and ignorant barbarians, ever quarrelfome and diforderly, into 
a peafantry, peaceable and regular ; a peafantry, perhaps, more intelligent and 
better educated than moft others in the ifland.
Such have been the effecls of Doeftor Graham’s exertions.

(in eskdale wardJ 
L IEIS within the barony of Gilfland.
“ Stapleton was firft demefnc of Gilf- 
" land, and granted very anciently forth as a fee to the lords of Kirklevington.
” Richard de Levington died feized of a moiety thereof in 34th Flenry III.
from 
** him it defcended to Radulf Levington, who, by Ada Gernon his wife (daughter 
" to Richard Gernon the elder, and to John Morvill, the fecond daughter and 
” coheir of Sir Hugh Morvill) had iflue Hawife, the wife of Sir Euftace Baliol.
Hawife died without ilTue ; therefore, Stapleton and others the Levington’s 
“ lands fell to her father’s fix lifters, fo became Matild de Garrick her heir of 
“ Stapleton.
Roland Garrick her fon gave it to Piers Tilliol in Edward Ill.'s 
time, and at that time the Stapletons held the other moiety, which defcended to 
" the Mufgraves, and the other moiety to the Morefbies and Golvilles, the heirs 
" of the Tilliols.”* 
This parifh, from the moft ancient evidence, appears divided into two manors,, 
Solport on the north and Stapleton on the fouth.
Dodor Todd derives the name 
of Stapleton, from Stableftand or Buckjially a ftation for watching the deer when 
the country was foreft.
Solport divifion comprehends the conftableries of Solport, Trough, and Bill- 
bank.
The manor of Solportif was the inheritance of the de Levingtons.
After 
failure of iflue in that family, and the partition before mentioned, it came to the 
family of Sir James Graham, the prefent owner.
The demefne lands are called 
the Shank, where are ruins of an old caftle, fo decayed as not to be worth a parti- 
cular defeription.
Trough was lately the freehold eftate of Mr. Robert Lowes of Hexham, and 
is now the property of his grand-nephew, Mr. Lowes of Ridley Flail, a minor.
It remained for a long time the pofTeftion of the Forfters.
The manor of StapietonJ was anciently the poflTeflion of a family of that name, 
and held by the Stapletons, temp.
King Edward III.
From them it pafTed to 
the Dacres, and is now the eftate of the Howards.
The church of Stapleton is redtorial :§ the patronage and right of prefentation 
is alternate in Sir James Graham and the Earl of Garlifle ; the yearly value about 40I.

Soil AND Produce.] The foil, in general, is a whitifli clay, with a rufty, gravelly bottom.
The 
produftions are oats, a little barley and grafs.
The corn is very flender, and grafs, in general, coarfc and 
thin.
The beft part of the parifh lies near the north end, called Solport.
Agriculture.] Agriculture does not feem here to have improved much, the people follow their old 
mode of management ; that is, negleding to fallow, and laying their lands dovra very poor.
Common.] This parifli is nearly furrounded with commons, or rather a fort of mountains, except on 
the weft fide, where it is what is called a flow or mofs of great extent, perfectly level and of very little 
value, on account of its wetnefs, which prevents any thing from coming upon it, except moor-game and

dated 1598.* 
The foil of this parifli is, in general, a cold clay ard wet, except on the banks 
of the Line, w here there arc fome dry, rich fields.
The inhabitants are induftri- 
ous.
There is plenty of limeflone almofl: in every farm, and their belt improve- 
ment is, in general, from letting the ground lie to grafs.
There are feveral large 
commons unimproved in the parifh, which make it have a bleak and moorifh ap- 
pearance; and from thefe the inhabitants dig peat for fuel, and turf for thatching 
their houfes and manuring their meadow grounds.
The parifli is diflant from 
market-towns; Carlifle, fourteen miles; Brampton and Longtown, about eight.
The country, throughout the whole parifh, is diverfified with vales and riling 
grounds, but with nothing w'hich properly can be called hills; yet thefe have a fine 
Sheep and other Cattle.] A few (Keep of the (hort Scotch breed are kept here, but little atten-

farmer for making up his rents, fo that horned cattle are the principal objedls of his care, thefe are gene- 
rally of the Cumberland breed ; with, perhaps, a few galloways upon the drier part of the moors, for the 
purpofe of breeding for fale.
Foel.] Their fuel is peat and turf, which are found in great plenty all over the parifli.
Estates ] Eftates are here in general about 40, 50, and even 80 pounds a- year, but few reaching 
to lool.
per annum.
Roads.] Here is only one principal road, and that of no great note, leading from Longtown towards 
Bewcaftle.
River.] White Line runs through the eaftern part of this parifh, in which-are great plenty of fifli.
It is but a fmall rivulet, and runs upon a very rocky bottom.
Wood.] Upon the hedges are a few trees, but fcarce any regular woods.
Aspect and Appearance.] This parifh lies inclining towards the weft, is uneven In furface, and 
has a dreary appearance.
Houses.] The houfes are geneisdly of clay and inconvenient — no villages of above two or three tene- 
ments.
Manners.] The people In this fequeftered place are not much cultivated ; they are of Ample manners, 
and civil to ftrangers.
Whether, in their circumftances and fituation, ignorance, or a knowledge of the 
Arts and Sciences, would contribute more to their happinefs, is a queftion not eafily decided ?

We 
have been happy to find, fince the publication of that part of our work, that the 
general characfter of the inhabitants, and their oeconomy of life, greatly differ from 
the fhade which was thrown over them ; that they are humane, courteous, and 
hofpitable ; and, perhaps, from not having too great a ftiare of erudition, the more

We have to lament, in common with other county hiftorians, that, in

jSay inhabitants ; of thofe, on an average of ten years, one in 45-6 died in each year.
The Rev. William Graham, the prefent reftor of this remote and obfeure parlfh, is intitled to our 
notice and warmeft approbation, from the exemplary diligence and ability, with which he difeharges the 
duties of his ftatlon.
His whole income, from his benefice, does not exceed forty pounds a-year ; on 
which, however, he is pafing rich : andbefides living both comfortably and ufefully, he is fuppofed, by 
dint of great induftry and ftridt frugality, to have realized a decent little fortune.
With all this com- 
mendable attention to worldly interells, be is by no means inattentive to interefts of greater moment.
Befides being a good parifh prleft, he is alfo a refpedtable author.
In 1783, he publifhed a difeourfe on 
“ The Unity of Water and Spiritual Baptifm and in 1788, another difeourfe, to prove that the 
Divine Prefcience, and the Scripture Do6lrIne of Predeftination, are perfeftly confiftent with the free 
“ Will of Man both of which are very far above mediocrity.
In 1786, be publilhed a tranflation in verfe, of the Eclogues of Virgil ; which, thougE fometimes almoft 
too literal, and perhaps too low, is In general faithful.; if his verfes never rife to the elegant eafe and 
fvveetnefs of the original, they never fink to meannefs ; and If due allowance be made for the many dif- 
advantages under which he muft have written them, It will not be denied, that they pofTefs confiderable

We fubjoin the following lines, taken at hazard from the firft Eclogue, as a fair fpecimen of all

There is a crofs about three miles diftant from Bewcaftle church, fituated at a place called Crofs-hilly 
at a fmall diftance from the Maiden-Way, running through this diftrift.
At a place called Currocks, ab<'ut fix miles from Bewcaftle, fituated upon a common in the midft of 
a mofs, is a large colleftion of ftones, about 150 yards in circumference, and 10 yards in height.
About half a mile from the Maiden-Way, as it runs towards Scotland, is a colleftion of ftones, which 
has all the appearance of a burying-ground, at a place called Hemp's graves; or, as I apprehend, more 
properly the Camp's graves, as there is every veftige of a camp in the neighbourhood, fituated betwixt 
the Cunocks and this crofs : alfo, near the Maiden-Way, is another large colleftion of ftones, about 50 
yards in circumference, which muft.
certainly have been ufed in ancient times as a cemeterium or burying- 
place.
About a year ago, from its peculiar fituation and form, I entertained a defire to acquaint my- 
felf farther about it ; about a week ago I attempted to make a trial and fearch, and found by perfever- 
ing that my ideas were not ill founded y fcr after working one day, I came to what may be properly 
c^ed a tomb, where two large ftones, 10 feet long, 4 feet thick, i and a half broad, or 4 feet diameter, 
were eredfed, and appeared to contain the bodies of the dead.
After working, and clearing ftones and 
rubbifli, I came to the cadaver, and from the bottom, laid with flags, took out a quantity of human bories : 
at the head was a large ftone, raifed upwards of fix feet high.
After working another day, I difeovered 
another of the like kind, under fimilar circumftanccs, at the foot of which there is a wall of mafonry', which 
I have found feparates thefe I before difeovered from others of the like kind in the fame ruinous heap.

Another brother, named Robert, was placed on a carucate of land at Bothcaflre, 
" and thereupon was called Robert of Bothcaftre.
Another brother married the 
“daughter and heir of Thurfbies, Lords of Thurfbie and Waverton; his name 
was Guido Boyvill.
He gave to his arms argent a ircte vert, whereunto was 
“ added a canton in the right corner, or quarter of the field, of what colour or 
In this parifli, John Bacon, Efq. of the Firft Fruit's office in the Temple, fo well known for his hof^ 
pitahty and benevolence to a numerous and rcfpedlable circle of friends ; and to whofe patronage arid 
encouragement, we are proud to own, this hiftory is much indebted ; has had the Angular good fortune 
to inherit two of the oldeft and beft eftates in the parilh.
I'hefe are Berwick’s Field, and King’s Field’s 
Mount : both of which have, for centuries paft, belonged to a family, which, though now extinft, has 
long been of fome note in the borders.
Elizabeth Hetherington, married to Mr. John Bacon of Mount, 
in 1721, and who was the mother of Mr. Bacon of the Temple, was the laft of the family.
Her mother 
was a Story, of the family of the Rev. Thomas Stor)’, RecSlor of Kirkbampton, and Vicar of Burgh upon 
Sands, foon after the Relloration.
She had two brothers, viz.
the Rev. Francis Hetherington, A.
M. 
late Reftor of the two parifces of Lenton and Evedon in Lincolnffiire ; a man of great worth and refpec- 
tability of charafter ; and no ordinary talents, as will appear from a copy of verfes, in Latin and Englifh, 
which we will fubjoin to this account.
The other brother was John Hetherington, Efq. of the Firft 
Fruits office.
Both the brothers died bachelors, having bequeathed the w'hole of their property to their 
nephew, John Bacon, Efq.
The Hetherlngtons are a very ancient border fansily ; and are remarkable, not only for having fo long 
preferved the family eftate, but for having produced fuiidry perfons of noteiu their day: among others, 
the late Mr. Hetherington, who gave fo large a fum of money in his life time, to found a charity for the 
relief of the blind, was defeended from the Hetherlngtons of Cumberland : and it appears that a George 
Hethrington was, in the reign of King Henry VIII.
appointed to be king’s bailiff.to keep watch and ward, 
in the parifh of Kirldlnton, on the weft marches.
That branch of the Bacon family w'hich fettled in the north, cannot now be traced farther back, than 
the time of Henry VIII.
Twm brothers, named John and William Bacon, who are faid to have been 
the relations of that family of the Bacons, which after-wards produced thofe ornaments, not only of this 
kingdom, but of mankind, (the Lord Keeper and Lord Chancellor Bacon) had removed from the mo- 
naftery of Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, to Wetherall, a cell belonging to the monaftery of St. Mary’s 
in York, improperly called an abbey.
On the diffolution of thefe monafteries, thefe two brothers were 
permitted to retire on penfions of 61 .
13s.
each, per annum ; and, what was perhaps of more confe- 
quence to them, and certainly of more confequence to the world, they were permitted to marry.
One of 
them married and fettled in Northumberland ; and from him the Bacons of Newton Cap are fuppofed to 
be defeended.
The other married and fettled at Brffcoe, near Carlifle, where Mr. William Bacoij, brother 
to Mr. Bacon of the Temple did refide * — Their arms are the fame as thofe of all the Bacons.
The verfes above-mentioned by Mr. Hetherington, here follow : — they were written on the Lord Mar- 
quis Graham’s having been attacked by two highwaymen ; one of whom he ffiot and killed ; the other 
ht purfued, till, quitting his horfe, he efcaped into a wood.

***** Radulf Levington had iffue Hawife, his only 
George Graham^ clock and watch-maker, was born at Horfgills, in this parifti, in the year 1675, 
and not at Gratrick (there being no fuch place, as far as we know, in our county) as is erroneoufly 
ftated in the Biographical Dictionary, from whence this account is chiefly taken ; from his father dying 
\rhen he was very young, he was brought up by, his elder brother, William Graham of Sikefide ; who, 
in 1688, fent him up to London ; but he was not put apprentice to Mr. Tompion, as is generally faid ; 
but after he had been fome time with another mafter, Mr. Tompion received him into his family, purely 
for his merit, and treated him with a kind of parental affeClion till he died.
That George Graham was, 
without competition the moft eminent of his proftflion,.
is but a fmall part of his charafter he was the 
belt mechanic of his time, and had a complete knowledge of praClicd aftronomy ; fo that he not only 
gave to various movements for the menfuration of time, a degree of perfection which had nevg: before 
been attained, but he invented feveral aftronomical inftruments, by which confiderable advances have been 
made in that fcience : he made great improvements in thofe which had before been in ufe, and by a .
wonderful manual dexterity, conftruCted them with greater precifion and accuracy, than any other per- 
fon in the world.
1 he great mural arch in the obfervatoi y at Greenwich, was made for Dr. Halley 
under his immediate infpeCtion, and divided by his own hand ; and of this Incomparable original, the 
bell inftruments of the kind in France, Spain, Italy, and the Weft Indies, are copies made by Englifh 
artifts.
The feCtor by which Dr. Bradley firft difeovered two new motions in the fixed ftars, was his 
invention and fabric.
He comprifed the whole planetary fyftcm within the compafs of a fmall cabinet, 
from which, as a model, all the modern orreries have been conftruCIed ; and when the French academi- 
cians were fent to the North to make obfervations, in order to afeertain the figure of the earth, they 
thought George Graham the fitted perfon in Europe to futnifli them with inftruments.
They accord- 
ingly fucceeded, performing their work in one year ; fo that by fubfequent obfervations in France, Sir 
Ifaac Newton’s theory was confirmed..
But the academicians who went to the fouth, not taking Geo.
Graham’s inftruments, were very much embarrafled and retarded.
He was many years a member of the 
Royal Society, to which he communicated feveral ingenious and important difeoveries, particularly a 
kind of horary alteration of the magnetic needle ; a quick-filver pendulum, and many other curious par- 
ticulars relating to the true length of the fimple pendulum, upon which he continued to make experiments 
till a few days before his death.
His temper was not lefs communicative, than his genius was penetrating, and his principal view was 
not, either the accumulation of wealth, or the difFufion of his fame, but the advancement of fcience, and 
the benefit of mankind.
As he was perfeftly fmcere, he w’as without fufpicion ; as he was above envy, 
he was candid ; and as he had a relilh for true pleafurc, he was generous.
He frequently lent money, 
but never could be prevailed upon to take any intereft ; and for that reafon he never placed out any 
money upon government fecurities.
He had bank notes which were thirty years old by him when he 
died ; and his whole property, except his ftock in^trade, was found in a ftrong box, which, though it was 
lefs than would have been heaped by avarice, was yet more than would have remained to prodigality.
He died the 20th November, 175 1, at his houfe in Fleet-ftreet, London ; and on the 24th, at night, 
was carried in a hearfe, preceded by three mourning coaches, with the gentlemen who were to fopport 
the pall ; and followed by nine to Weftminfter abbey, and there interred in the fame grave with the re- 
mains of his predeceflbr, Mr. Tompion.
The pall was fupported by Dr. Knight, Mr. Watfon, Mr.

father, who, of one blood made all the nations of the eartli, and who is no refpefterof perfons ; and hence, 
all his difeourfes were tindlured with the amiable fpirit of univerfal benevolence, anxious to promote the 
real and folid happinefs of all his brethren : and well knowing this happinefs can only be grounded 
on the folid bafis of religion and piety ; he frequently and warmly enforced the advice of Eliphaz to Job, 
“ Acquaint thyfelf with God, and be at peace,” which he dwelt upon with much affeftlonate earneRnefs 
the lail time he was at meeting, and which was about nine days before his death.
He died at his own 
houfe at Carlifle, in the year 1780, and was buried at Megg’s-hill in this parifli.
Thomas Story was born at JuRIceTown in thisparilh, about the year 1670, and had the advantage of 
a liberal education, being deligned by his father (who was the proprietor of JuRice Town) for the Rudy 
of the law; he was placed vvith counfcllor Gilpin of Scale by CaRle, preparatory to his entering one of the 
Inns of Court ; but while he was there, he conceived offence at fome of the ceremonies of the then eRa- 
blilhed ahurch, and foon after joined himfclf in fociety w'ith the people called Quakers ; whofe con- 
vincement was not owing to the miniftry of any inftrument, but to the immediate operation of the grace 
of God in his own heart.
Some years after his joining this fociety, he recieved a gift in thCiminiRry 
himfelf, and devoted much of his time to traveling in the exercife thereof, for the edification of bis 
Irrethren, and the-convincement of others, in moR parts of the BritiRi dominions, on both fidcs of the 
Atlantic, and once on the European continent.

work, and forming part of the outfide walls.
A few

In the year 1698, he went over to Pennfylvania, and fome few years after was appointed a member 
of the Council of State for that province, Keeper of the Great Seal, Mafter of the Rolls, one of the 
Commiffioners of Property, and alfo Recorder of the city of Philadelphia, being the firft Recorder that 
corporation had.
His eldeft brother was Dean of Limerick in Ireland, with whom he kept up an inti-

In the year 1715 he returned to England, and planted upon his 
eftate at Juftice Town, feveral forts of foreign trees, as Tulip Trees, I.ocuft Trees, Cedars of America, 
Scarlet Oaks, See. that he might be an example to others in that ufcful kind of improvement.

The eaft point of

There, and about Kirklinton, the land is very good, and produces fine crops of wheat and other grain ;

Agriculture and Buildings.] The farmers of this parifh have improved much iii their methods 
of agriculture, by which they raife more than double the quantity of wheat and barley, which was pro- 
duced formerly.
However, the landlords are not fo forwaid in the improvements of the buildings : thefe 
are generally of clay, low, mean, and ill contrived ; fo that, was it not ule that habituates the natives 
thereto, they would certainly feel themfelves very difagreeably fituated.* 
Quarries.] There are feveral excellent freeflone quarries upon the brook, called Hether.
There 
is alfo freeftone upon the river Line.
No manufa£lures or great towns, the people are chiefly farmers.
Rivers.] The river Line, or Leven, bounds this parifli on the north ; it is llkewife watered by feve-

Extent.] About three fquare miles and a half.
Soil and Produce.] Soil, on the fouth fide of the parKh, is a fertile, fandy, loam ; which is aifu 
found in fmall portions in fome other parts.
A great proportion of the parilh was common, and inclofed 
about a hundred years ago.
The foil thereof, though much improved, has not reached that degree of 
fertility which is obfervable in the old inclofures : the quality is various, but much of it a little 
wet and clayey.
A part is extremely barren, and yet lying in a ftate of nature.
The agricultural im- 
provements, made in this parilh by that fpirited gentleman, Mr. Richardfon of Rickerby, afford the 
moll llriking leffons to farmers in the neighbourhood ; fome of whom, 1 was happy to hear, were begin- 
ning to profit thereby.
Small traiSls of peat-mofs occupy different parts of the parilh.
The foil is, in 
general, fuited to the produdlion of every grain, root, and grafs ; but wheat and barley feem mod at- 
tended to, A few farmers fow clover, or artificial graffes w'ith barley, after a turnip crop.
Two very great errors appear generally prevalent among the farmers : the firll is, taking two or more 
white crops in fuccefiion ; and the fecond, exhaulling the land by almoft conftant cropping.
A due 
proportion of paduring, robbing, and meliorating crops, would be a great improvement, as would a greater 
extenfion of the turnip and clover culture ; to which fydem, great part of the parilh feems peculiarly 
adapted.
Sheep and Cattle.] In this didri£l there may be about 150 Iheep kept, which are of the long 
wooled breeds ; fome of which have been fold for 2I.
at one year old.
The bed breeds would anfwer well 
here.
Cattle are generally of the Cumberland fort, and not numerous, but pretty good in their kinds ; 
not many are facted, nor is the dairy much attended to ; the plough engroffes moil part of the farmers’ 
care.
Rent and Farms.] The common average rent of farms on the bed foils, is about 253.
per acre ; on 
the lefs fertile the rent may be 15s.
ics.
or even 7s.
per acre.
Some fmall parcels rented for particular

Tithes.] Are taken in kind.
Tenure.] Is cudomary under the bishop of Cailifle.
Fuel.] Some peat, but principally coal.
RiVERs.] The Eden bounds the fouth fide of this parilh.
Woods.] No regular woods, a few trees on hedges.
Quarries ] A fine red fieedone quarry, opened lately upon the Eden, on the Holm-end farm.
Roads.] ^'he road between Carllfie and Newcadle leads through this parilli, in tolaable repair) as 
does the ffte'of the P^^s wall 
Schools.] Two fmall fchools at Lew Crofhy, neither of which is endowed.
Poor,] The poor of this parilh are at prefen: fupported for about is.

AsREcr AND General Appearance.] The fouth part of this parifh, is a mod beat iti fill, level, 
and fertile vale, formed!
by the Eden, with pretty fields, and hedge rows of thorn.
The other parts higher, 
and fomevvhat bleak, but not unpleafaiit, and have a fine open view to the fouth.
Buildings are mollly

Cohortis quarta pratoriana pofuit centuria Julii F' xtalis.
— At Dranx:dtkes, about a quarter of 
amilc eaft from Starinxiicks, is one of thofe inferiptions, that are ufually found on the face of the wall ; but it 
has this peculiar curiofity in it, that the century feems to have belonged to the guards t or to a Pratorian 
cohort ; and the name of Julius Vitalise naturally brings to mind the famous infeription at Bath, which 
has employed the pens of fome of our moft learned antiquaries.
Moll probably this has been brought 
from the wall hereabouts.
I dont find that it has been taken notice of before.
It is now fet above a 
garden door, not far from the infeription which next follows.
The letters are not very well cut, the A 
has no tranfverfe, and the lhape of the L agrees with one of thofe 1 laft produced from Camden.
This, 
perhaps, and fome other Pratorian cohorts, might come over with Severus to attend his perfon, and fo

_ Gruter and Camden fpeak of it as then 
a: Carlifle, in the houfe of Thomas Aglionhy, Efq. near the citadel ; from whence, no doubt, it has been 
removed to Dram.'dikes, which dill belongs to the Aglionly family.
Camden fays, there was joined to 
this infeription, an armed herfeman 'with a lance , but the fculpture pf this Hone is quite different, fo that 
what he mentions, muft have been upon another Hone, which is no'w loft.
This fculpture and infcrip= 
tion, have a!fo been publiftied by Mr. Gordon, whole copy differs, both from Mr. Casnden aud this ; but 
1 can venture to fay, this was taken with the greateft care and exadlnefs.
Theie is an I, or a ftroke 
too much in Augujiinii, if the name is to be fo read ; but Mr. IVard rather chufes to read the middle 
part of this infciipticn thus, /lugujliani hunc tumuluni faciendum curavit JElia Ammilla Lufma.
The 
name Augufianus is fevcral times in Gruter, who likewKe has Lufmius.
Nor was it unufual for women 
to have three names : nothing is more common upon funeral inicripticns than hoc monumentum, and hunc 
tiiulum ; in the fame manner as hunc tumulum (if it be not a contradlion of titulum) upon this.
The 
lhape of the letters has the caft cf the lower empire ; but K for C, appears in other inferiptions of an 
older date than any in Britain.
The head, at the top of the ftone :bove the infeription, is, I fuppofe, 
dtfigned for the head of the perfon deceafed ; and probably, the heads which the lions feem to be guard-

Eden is Scanwix, or Stane Wegges [i.
e. a place upon the ftony way, a town 
“ in the time of King Henry 1.
who gave the appropriation of it to the church 
** of Carlifle.
The Pifts wall is very vifible here.” Mr. Gough, in his edition, 
^ds, Here is a plain area of a Ration, and a gentle def(||nt to the fouth ; and 
«*'the rifing for the out-buildings, which the abundance of Rones dug up, prove 
to have Rood here.
Some of the Rones anfwered to the defcription of an

The ruins of the wall are very vifible to the precipice.
The ditch 
** diRin(5i: on the weR of the village, between it and the Eden, feems to have been 
” Severus’, whofe wall forms the north rampart of the Ration.” 
This place, according to Mr. Horfley and other judicious antiquaries, f whofe 
judgment and authority have not in this cafe been controverted) was the Congaruata 
of the Romans j the next Ration, ad lineam Valli to Pelriam^ known now by the 
name of Cambeck-fort or Cajisteads: IVatch-crqfs, a fmall Roman fort, before- 
mentioned, deviating from that line confiderably to the fouth.
This, according 
to Mr. Horfley’s enumeration, w'as the fifteenth Roman city or Rationary town 
on the wall; and agreeable to plotitia^ had the name of Cpngavatay and was 
garrifoned by the cohors fecund, legorum.
Camden placed the ‘Ration Congavata 
at RoJe~Cafle on the river Caude ; but it appears here in order, and evident proofs 
have been obtained to afeertain it..
Severus’ w’all has formed the north rampart 
of the Ration, and has Rretched through the gardens of the village, foine of them 
being fenced with Rones obtained from it.

Enough has been fald of the mattes in fome former inferiptions.
This altar is now at Scalely Cajlle, 
I believe it belongs to Stannseicks ; for.
Mr. Goodnian of Carbjle told me, he prefented an altar, not many 
years ago, to Mr. Gilpin, which hadlbecn dug up at Statsvueiks ; but he could not recolledt the infer ip- 
tion.
I take this to be the altar, becauTe it never has-been publifired, till lately by Mr. Gordon ; whereas 
all the reft that were legible at Scaleby Cajdewtxc made public long ago ; and this is yet legible, though 
Mr. Gordon has only given us the two firft lines, and omitted the two laft.

Mr. Horfley and Mr. Warburton fay, “ This fituation will fuit exadly well 
with thofe rules which the Romans obferved in building rhefe flaiions ; for here 
** is a plain area for the ftation, and a gentle defeent to the fouth, and towards the 
“ river for the out-buildings ; and by all accounts, and the ufual evidences, it is 
upon this defeent, and chiefly to the fouth-eaft, that the Roman buildings have 
“ flood.
Abundance of ftones have been lately dug up in this part ; fome, by 
“ the defeription given of them, refembled the flones of an aquedudl.” 
In the year 1356, the bridge crofling Eden, to this place was ruinous j and

lands being all freehold.
Rickerby lies to the cafl, and was under the barony of Crofby, or a dependant 
manor.
The Bifliop of Carlifle receives thereout, an annual quit-rent of 13s.
4d.
The manor has been greatly mutilated of late years, by fales made of parcels of 
land, or members of the cuflomary tenures, to the feveral tenants, who thereby 
became infranchifed.
It was part of the extenfive pofTeflions of the Tilliols.
Among the fuccee^iTig owners, we find Pickerings and Wellons named: of the 
Weflons, Sir Edward Mufgravc purchafed, and fold to one Srudholme, from whom 
it paffed to the Gilpins, in which family it continued for three generations, Mr.
Richardfon purchafed what remained unfold off to the .tenants.
LinstockJ lies to the calt of Rickerby, near the banks of the river.

PARISH OF STANWIX.
Earl Gol^trick, and Lord of Allerdale, gave to the church of Carlifle.
The 
” prefent name, I fancy, is a remain of Olenacum; for tHg'Olenacum, where the 
Ala Prima Herculea lay in garrifon againft the barbarians, feems to have been 
“ along the wall." 
“ Between the river Eden and Brunlkeugh Beck, lyes the barony of Lynftock 
“ and Crofby, which is now a feigniory of the Birtiop of Carlifle.
King Henry I, 
“ gave Lynilock and Carleton to Walter his chaplain, to be holden of the kings ot 
“ England, by cornage filver, to be paid yearly.
The faid Walter, voluntarily 
“ of himfelf, and by the king's licence, took upon him the religious habit, of a 
“ regular canon in the priory of St. Mary in Carlifle: and by the king’s confent, 
** he gave Lynftock and Carleton to that houfe of religion in pure alms for ever.
Whereupon the king releafed and acquitted the rent and fervices to the canons 
“ there, and they made the faid Walter their prior.
He was the lecond prior of 
“ that houfe of St. Mary at Carlifle.
After they were pofleffed of Lynflock ba- 
rony, they made a grange at Crolby, which was therefore called Crofiy^ becaufe 
“ it was church lands: and fometimes the barony oL^ynflock is called Crofby ba^ 
“ rony of that grange, or chief feat Crolby, which ismow^become a town of many 
“ inhabitants.
At the firft foundation of that houfe of canons by King Henry I.
and of the 
bifliop’s fee at Carlifle, both their lands were holden, pro indivifo, as in common.
And after the firft partition thereof made by Gualo, the Pope’s legate, cardinal 
of St. Martin in King John’s time, the barony of Lynftock fell to the biftiop and 
“ his fucceiTors, and Carleton to the prior and convent, and to the bifhop, and 
remained ftill undivided, until Bardolph, another legate, in King Henry^Iil.’s 
time, by the fecond diftribution, afligned them the biftiop’s part of Carleton, and 
“ other things in Cumberland, for their moiety of the appropriate church of 
" Warkvvorth in Northumberland.
The aforefaid Walter the prior, and Athclwald the firft biftiop of that fee, 
were witnefles to the grant of confirmation of Holm Cultram, made to the abbot 
“ there, by Malcolmb, fon of Henry the Earl, fon of David King of Scotland, 
“ which Malcolmb lived in the beginning of the reign of King Henry II.
and 
was king twelve years.
“ This barony contained Lynftock, Crofby, Walby, Richardby, and Newby.
“ Walby was fo called of the Pids wall, whereunto it adjoineth ; and Newby, as 
“ a later building, yet now it is an eminent town.
For King Henry I.
gave the 
“ fame Newby to one Hildred to be holden of the king by cornage ; and one Trute 
fucceeded Hildred, and Richard, fon of Trute fucceeded his father.
In King 
“ John’s time, one William, fon ot Bernard, held that land as guardian to Richard, 
“ the fon of Richard, the fon of Trute aforefaid.
Shortly after,'the faid laft Richard, 
“ fon of Richard, confirmed Newby to Reginald de Carlifle and his heirs, to be 
“ holden of him, by paying los.
yearly rent-fervice to him, and i6d.
cornage, and 
“ foreign fervice.
The faid Reginald de Carlifle gave the fame to the abbot and 
“ convent of Holm Cultram, referving the like rents.
And after the death of 
« Richard, fon of Richard, his After Margaret, wife of Robert de Wathampolc, 
“ daughter.

Linftock continued a long time the chief country manfion of the bifhops; and 
here Bilhop Halton, about the year 1 293, entertained Johannes Romanus the Arch- 
bifbop of York with his train, amounting to upwards of three hundred in number, 
for a confiderable time, whilft he was on his vifitation.

upon the death of Chriflophcr Aglionby of Nunnery, Efq. his effates were divided, 
by a decree of the Court of Chancery, amongfl his four fillers, and this part pafied 
to John Orfeur Yates of Skirwith Abbey, Elq. in right of Mary his wife, youngell 
daughter of Henry Aglionby, (by Anne, fourth daughter of Sir Chriffopher Muf-^ 
grave of Edenhall, Bart.) and coheir of the faid Chrillophcr Aglionby of Nun- 
nery.
Efq.J: 
Tarraby and Houghton, formerly the eftate of the Formers.
It palled by 
exchange from Forfler, Efq. to Sir John Lowthcr, Bart, who again ex- 
changed with Chriftopher Dalfion, Efq. for the manor of Malkinthorpe in Weft- 
morland, and by his grandfon.
Sir William Dalfton, Knr. was pafTed by exchange, 
and fold out to the tenants about the year 1764.
There was formerly a very old caRle at Drawdykes, fituated where the prefent manfion now Rands, 
u^ron the fite of Adrian’s Wall which may be Rill traced from Brunllceiigh Beck through part of the 
edatc.
The wall of Severus alfo runs through the whole length of it, north of the caRle, where the ridge 
of the wall, and the ditch, not yet completely levelled by the plough, remains vifible, and marks its courfe 
towards Stanwix.
After the Aglionby family withdrew themfelves into Carlifle, from the place of their 
firR fettlement, which Rill retains their name : they frequently refided at the ancient caRle of Drawdykes, 
the greateft pait of which was taken down in the laR century, and rebuilt in its prefent form, by John 
Aglionby, the then recorder of Carlifle (a man as remarkable for his abilities, as for the popularity and 
influence he, had in that city) who placed the three remarkable Rone buRs upon the battlement, which 
Rill remain there ; a^d are traditionally faid, to have been dug out of the Roman wall, or Its vicinity; 
and to fiave^heen fomc ^ the houfchold gods, or penates of the Romans.
The remaining part of the 
caRle was taken down ^out 30 years ago, when the prel'ent farm houfe was built.
The regiRer of 
Stanwix fliews the birth and marriages of feveral of the Aglionb es ; but they feem always to have burled 
in the ancient vault of the family, in the old church of St. Cuthbert’s in Carlifle, from w'hence the mo- 
nurarntal Rones, and armorial bearings were removed, when that church was rebuilt fome years ago.
It is not afeertained where the remarkable fepulchral infeription, built into the back wall of the caRle 
of Drawdykes, was originally found ; but as Camden faw It in the houfe of Thomas Aglionby, in Car- 
lifle, it is plain it miiR have been there lirR, and afterwards removed.
The armed horfeman, which he 
alfo mentions feeing at the fame time and place, is not now there, but probably may have been removed 
with a Roman altar, of which he gives the infeription to Drumbtigh caRle, fome time the properly of 
the fame family.

The Drawdykes eRate is toll free of the city of Carlifle, a right fometiines interrupted by the mayor 
and corporation, and finally tried, and decided in favour of the exemption from toll, at the affixes, 1775.
It alfo pays a prefeription of 3s.

to the vicar of Stanwix, in lieu of tithes.

PARiai^ OF STAKWIX.
Etterby confifls of about fourteen tenements, held of the barony of Burgh, $ 
under Lord Lonfdalc, fome of them as parcel of the manor of Weftlinton.
There 
is a tradition accompanied with the ancient name of Arlhuaiburgum, (which is 
found in fome old writings) that this place entertained the Britifh King Arthur, 
about the year 550, whilll he carried his vidcorious arms againfi; the Danes and 
Norwegians.
This ftory has no foundation in hiflory, and there are no marks of 
antiquity about the place to give fupport to the conjedlure.
Arthur’s Borough, 
and Arthur’s Round Table have the fame fupport in tradition only.
The country 
around Stanwix is cultivated and conhlls of very rich lands, fo that even many 
parts of the Roman works are very faint, and fome almoft effaced.
Staintqn is a mefne manor wdthin the barony of Burgh, formerly parcel of the 
manor of Weftlinton.
It belonged to the Mufgraves of Crookdake in this county ; 
William, the lafl of the male line, devifedit to his two younger daughters, Mary, 
Charters widow, and Dorothy the wife of William Afkew, who in 1679, enfran- 
chifed the greateft part of it ; and about the year 16S6, fold the fame to Sir John 
Lowther, the lord paramount, he haying the year before purchafed the faid ba- 
rony.
It is now hcldenof James, Earl of Lonfdale, and confifts of about twenty 
Juftomary tenements, which are very high rented and pay a tw'enty-penny fine 
certain.
Cargo or Carighow, named of Craghow, a craggy hill, the manor of Jofeph 
Lamb, Efq. of Newcaftle upon Tyne.
“ Carghow, als Carighow, is a village on the north eaft fide of the river Edcn^ 
“ between Rowcliff and Stainton.
It was firft; a manor and demefne, the inheri- 
tance and poffefiion of John de Lacy, conftable of Chefter, who held the fame of 
“ the king immediately by cornage.
This John Lacy granted the fame, and 
** Cringledyke, a territory there to the fame, belonging to William de Vefey and 
his heirs, Lords of Alnwick in Northumberland, and of Mahan in Yorkfhire* 
‘' to be holden of the donor and his heirs, for a mewed hawk yearly for all fer- 
“ vices.
William Vefey gave it to Evvon Carlifle, Knt. for lands in Yorkfhire, 
“ referving to him and his heirs the fame fervices.
And afterwards, in the fccond 
year of Edward I.
Robert de Rofs, Lord of Werk in Tindal, died feized thereof ; 
“ he held the fame of Sapiens, the wife of William Carlifle the younger, reddendo, 
“ a hawk or a mark of money yearly, and difeharging the faid Sapiens of foreign 
“ fervices, viz.
23^/ de cornagio ad fcaccarium Carliol.
From this Robert llofs 
“ it defeended by many defeents in the iffue male, until the 3 2d year of Edward 
“ III.
; and ftaortly after, Elizabeth Rofs, the heir general, transferred the inheri- 
“ tance to the Parrs of Kendal, with other lands.
In which houfe it defeended 
«' by many defeents until William Parr, late Marquis of Northampton, who dying 
“ without iffue, the w'idow.

The caufe of fo fmall a difference between the chriftenings and the burials in this latter period, arifes from the

Extent,] King-Moor* is an extra parochial place, nearly encircled by the parilh of Stanwix, It 
•contains about two I'quare iiiiles ; and the parilh of Stanwix about eight and a half fquare miles.
Soil and Produce.] The foil in both tbefe places is a clay, but varies its nature in different fitua- 
tions ; the holms to the N.
W. and W.
parts, have a mixture of fand, which contribute to form a deep, 
fine mould, producing wheat and other grain in great perfeftton.
Cargc-holm is, however, ftronger 
and 
• The hamlet of King-Moor Is of a form nearly fquare, and contains about 1100 acres.
— ft was formerly veiled in 
the Crown : the citizens, or corporation of Carlifle, having a preferiptive right to depafture their cattle, and get turves 
thereon ; which right was confirmed to them by the charter of Edward III.
and the fubfequent ones granted by molt 
vof II.

and better adapted for c-orn than Staintou-holin, which produces grafs better.
About Stanwix and 
Rickerby, particulaily the latter, the land is excellent.
The holms are beautiful, and form fine pafiurage.
Towards the eaft, and interioi parts of the parilh ; as aUb in King- Moor, the land is cold, wet, and 
barren ; the foil is clay, intermixed with a rufty fand, and in fome places with mofs.
This land is very- 
capable of improvement, as is tefiified In the efiate, purchafed lately in King-Moor by Mr. Lanib of 
New'caflle.
This eftate nov.' lets for above 300!.

"I i he holms, to the north-weft, let at between 30 and 40s.
per acre.
The fouth part being 
near Carlifle, the land on that account, lets above its intrinfic value ; the interior parts of the parifh may, 
on an average, be worth i6s.
per acre.
Fuel,] Is coal from Tindale and Talkin Fells.
Stone and ButLDiNGS.] In Eden is a foft freeftone, but no quarries opened.
Ancient buildings 
are all of clay, wretchedly contrived ; but of late they build with brick, the parifti abounding with fine 
clay for making bricks.
The foutli part of this pririlh 'being iirthe vicinity of Oarlifle, occafions a num- 
ber of neat and good houfes to be erefted there, being the property of feveral people of eafy fortunes.
At Rickerby, Mr. Rrchardfon has purchafed eftates, built a neat houfe, laid out beautiful gardens fur- 
nilhed wdth ftoves, pleafure grounds, and other ornaments.
This gentleman was a native of this place, 
and went early to London, where, by trade, he raifed a large fortune.
He now amnfes himfelf in 
this retirement with buildings and agriculture, having improved the eftates he Iras purchafed here, and 
in the neighbouring parifties, to a high degree.
Rivers and Bridges.] Eden bounds this pariih on the fouth and weft : from vVhich, great quanti- 
ties of falmon are taken, being the chief fifhery in the river Eden.
Hero alfo the famous King Garth’s 
Rell was fixed by Lord Lonfdale, the fubjedt of much litigation.
Between Stanwix and Carlifle are two 
bridges over Eden, but fo narrow that it is with diffiCTilty two carriages can pafs each other ; feveral 
misfortunes have happened on that account, feveral black catilc have been killed, owing to the narrow- 
nefs of the bridges, and the fide walls or battlements giving way, efpecially in the time of fairs, which are 
held between the bridges.
It was lately in agitation to rebuild the bridges on a better plan.
The rrvec 
might be made navigable up to Carlifle ; a public objedf of great importance hitherto negledfed.
Sheep and Cattle.] No quantity of Iheep of any confequence ; other cattle are, in general, large 
and heavy.
Aspect and General /S ppearance.] This parifli is pretty level and high, except near the river, 
where the ground has an inclination towards k.
There is not much wood in the pariilr, except about 
King Moor, where are forr.e fir plantations.
Great part of the hedges in the interior parts of the parifh 
are made fencible only with whins or furze, which gives the country'- a barren appearance ; but near the 
river, the land is beautiful to a great degree.
The profpefts from this place are extremely pidlurefqiie- 
and fine : the city of Carlifle has a noble appearance on the bofom of the vale.
Game.] Are hares and partridges.
School.] Here are feveral fmall fchools, but none endowed.
Housman’^s Notes.
of the other kings and queens of England, down to Charles If..
In the year 1682, the corporation leafed out a part of 
this moor, for three lives, at a fniall rent; and fo, from time to time, granted other parts thereof in like manner, which 
leafes were regularly renewed on the dropping of one or two of the lives, on payment of 20s.
as a fine for every new 
life.
The whole of the moor hath been thus held ever fince, except Mr. I.amb’s, the principal eftate, of which the cor- 
poration granted the fee about 50 years ago.
In the year 17.^2, fome of the freemen of this corporation, being difpofed 
to revive the exetcife of their right of common of pafture and turbary on this moor, an adtion at law was commenced, 
in confequence thereof, which was argued at the aflizes held at Carlifle the year following, and determined in favour of 
the occupiers, or leftees of the corporation.
The foil is moftly light and blackifh, intermixed with many fmall rough pebbles; under which, in moll places, at a 
little depth, is very good day for bricks ; particularly at Gcfling Sike, where great quantities are made.
The yearly 
value is from 7s.
to ll, 58.
per acre, the average about 13s.
The eftate of Mr. Lamb, which contains about 400 acres, 
is kept in complete cultivation by the farmer, Mr. Ivifon : on this eftate, is a garden of above four acres, well laid out, 
and kept in excellent order, in which is an elegant fummer-houfe, commanding a very extenfive profpe<ft ; much frequent- 
ed by parties from Carlifle and the neighbourhood, in the fummer feafon.
On Mr. Lamb’s eftate, are alfo about ay acres 
of plantations, taoftly of Scotch firs; great part of which have attained a good growth ; the reft of the moor has very 
little wood.

THE CITY OF CARLISLE.
T he traveller approaching from the fouth* has the befl view of the city, feat- 
ed on a fine eminence, gradually emerging from an extenfive plain of rich 
cultivated land.
The waters of the Frith are feen on the one hand, with the ad- 
jacent levells; the back ground of the landfcape is beautifully variegated by the 
irregular fwells of the whole Scotch promontory, extending towards the Irifh fea.
The walls ftrengthened with an arrangement of buttreffes at irregular diftances, 
lies upon one angle to the view ; in part, concealing the houfes of the city, and 
boldly overtoped by the fquare tower of the caftle, and the auguft and folemn 
ftrudure of the cathedral.
This view of Carlifle is the more ftriking, as there in 
no adjacent eminence ; from which caufe the city looks more majeftic, as it crowns 
fo beautiful a plain.
The city is walled round, the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the mofl 
modern; they are formed of better fquared Hones than I'everal other parts of the 
works.
The eafl: and fouth fides are fupported by a multitude of buttreffes, which, 
we prefume, have been built up occafionally, to llrengthen the decaying part.s of 
the wall.
It is watered by three fine rivers, the Eden on the north, the Peterill 
on the eafV, and Caude on the wcfi:.
There are three gates to the city, which, 
from their different afpeds, are called the Engliflr, Irifli, and Scotch Gates.

the approach from Penrith, on the fouth, you enter the Englifh Gates; on the ap- 
proach from Wigton, on the louih-wefl, is the Iiilli Gate-; and the Scotch Gate, 
to the north, opens upon the bridges.
The walls are embrazured, but without 
any earth-work.
The Englilh Gate is guarded by a very Prong machicolated gate, 
flanked by circular towers of great flrength ; the guns mounted therein in feveral 
tiers, would effectually fweep every approach.
This gateway, with its towers and 
other W'orks, is commonly t ailed the Citadel, f and was erected by the order of 
King Henry VIII.
The caffle confifls of various works, but being kept up as 
a garrifoned place, we conceive it imprudent to deferibe them minutely.* The 
donion, or great tower, more properly deferves the title of the citadel, being 
furrounded by the other works ; it is fquare and very lofty, and the walls of vaff 
flrength and thicknefs, being conftructed agreeably to the old modes of defence, 
before the uCe of cannon : it was ftrengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch, 
and defended by modern works ; a half-moon battery mounted w'ith cannon, and 
a very large platform alfo mounted with cannon, under cover of the outward wall.
The top of the tow'er being embrazured and lined with turf, and mounted with 
large cannon, this part of the fortrefs could make a good defence, and fuftain a 
formidable attack.
By a well of vaft depth conffructed within the great tower, 
and faid to be of Roman work, the fupply of water for the garrifon could not be 
cut off by an enemy.
This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Caffle in Nor- 
thumberland, and has been conffructed at the fame rime the great .rower was 
built.;}; In the outer caffle is a fine grafs plot, a garden and governor’s houfe.
But it will be expedted by our readers, that we give a more particular deferip- 
tion of this city, and collect the hifforical fadts relative to it.
The name of Carliffe has been deduced by feveral authors, from different ety- 
mologies.
The Britiffi chronicle informs us, this city was built by a Britifli 
potentate, called Luel.
Lcland fays, “ the Irillimcn call bale a town, and fo 
peradventure did the old Scottes : thus might be faid that lugabalia foundeth 
“ Liiel’s-town.'”^ The Romans called it Liigovallinm, or Lugitbalhbn, from its fi- 
tuation on Severus’ wall, and from the troops and people garrifoned there.
Ptolemy 
calls it Leucopibiy Nennius Can Lualid.
The Saxons retained the old name Luel ; 
the Welfh writers give it the name of the city of Dubaiius.
Some derive the name 
-j- “ An oblong with three round ballions.” — Pennant.
The ancient entrance into the city was 
through the citadel.
* There were feveral officers appointed to this fortrefs, viz.
a governor, deputy governor, town-major, 
engineer, barrack- mailer, llore-keeper, head gunner, three quarter gunners, and a perfon to buy in and 
deliver out coals and candles to the garrifon.
For many years, prior to 1761, the governor of this city 
w'as choftn from one of the reprefentatives in parliament ; and mofl.
of the fubordinate places in the gar- 
rifon were given to the freemen of the city, and generally members of the corporation, lo that frequently 
the chief magiftrate was a quarter gunner.

from the ancient Britifn Llu-gyda~gwaly which implies an army by the wall ; from 
whence it is affcrteh the Romans framed their appellation of LngovalHum ; others 
from Lagus, or Lucus, which, in the language of the Celine and Britains, lignified a 
tower; and which, with the Roman compound, exprefTed a tower or fort upon the 
wall or vallum : to the Saxon name was added, the word eaer, or city ; and from- 
thefc, Caer Leuel^ the prelent name of Car-lijle^ feems to come by an eafy corrup- 
tion.
it is rcafonable to apprehend, that in fo fine a lituarion, on the confluence 
of three rivers, and the grand eltuaric of the Frith, this place was of fome flrengrh 
and dirtintflion before the coming of the Romans ; it wdll naturally follow, that 
the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus’ wall, or the vallum of 
Hadrian ; and we conceive that Leland points out the mofl; probable etymology.
Camden and his editors have taken great pains on this fubjeefl, “ The Romans and 
“ Britains called it Luguvallum and Luguballium, or Liignballia ; the Saxons, as 
“ writeth, Luel ; Ptolemy, as fome think, Lucopibia, (which feems rather to 
be a corruption ot i.
e. white houfes, and to be Candida Cafa, or 
“ IVbitborn in Galloway) Nemicus Caer Lualid the ridiculous Welfh prophecies, 
“ the city of D itb alius ; we Carlijle ; and the Latins, from the more modern name, 
“ Carleolum.
For that Luguballia and Carlifle are the fame, is univerfally agreed 
by our hiftorians.
Bur as to the etymology, what pains has our countryman, 
“ Leland, taken about it, and at lafl: he is driven upon this fhift, that Ituna might 
be called Lugas, and that Ballurn came from Vallis, a valley, and fo make Lugu- 
vallum, as much as a valley upon the Luge.
But to give my conjeflures alfo, 
I dare affirm, that the vallum and valia were derived from that famous military 
vallum of the Romans, which runs hard by the city.
For Antoninus calls Lugu- 
vallum ad vallum ; and the Pi(5ls wall, which was afterwards built on the wall of 
“ Severus, is to be feen at Stanwicks, a fmall village a little beyond the Eden.
It 
** palled the river over againft the caflle ; where, in the very channel, the remains 
“ of it, namely, great (tones appear to this day.
Alfo, Pomponius Mela has told 
us, that lugus or lucus lignified a tower among the old Celta, who fpoke the fame 
“ language with the Britains ; for what Antoninus calls lugo augufi, is in him turris 
“ augujli ; fo that luguvallum, both really is, and fignifies a tower or fort upon the 
wall or vallum.
Upon this foundation, if the French had made their lugdunum 
“ lignify a tower upon a hill, and their lucotetia (fo the ancients called what we 
call liitetia) a beautiful tower ; for the words import fo much in the Britifli, 
“ they might poffibly have been more in the right, than by deriving the latter 
“ from lutum, dirt ; and the former from one Lugdus, a fabulous king.
As to the 
** prefent name, Carljle, the original of this is plain enough, from the Britifli, caer, 
“ a city ; and Lual, Luel, Lugubal, Leil, or Lull, according to the feveral appelia- 
** tions, antient or modern, importing as much as the town or city of Luul, &c.”f 
it 
Mr. Gough’s additions are, “ Dr. Gale derives it from lie, an army ; gual, the wall ; as lugdu- 
num from llu ; and dun, a hill ; for Tacitus fays, the Lyonnois called themfelves a Roman colony, and 
part of the army.
Lugo Augufti in mela, is Turris Augulli.

after placing a gatrifon here, returned into the fouth, and fent hither Myccle Cypliycey polcep

CARLISLE.
It has been the opinion of feveral judicious vifitants, that the river Eden has 
fhifted its courfe and channel fince the time of the Romans, and that formerly it 
paired nearer to the caftle ; for it fhould feem an inconliftent talk for that wife 
people, to make their work traverfe a rapid and broad river, otherwife than in a 
dire<fl; line.
Both Mr. Horlley, and Mr. Warburton join in this opinion.
It may fafely be determined, that the Romans found this a place of fome im- 
portance ; but that it was, in their time, rather a place of recefs after the toils of 
warfare were over, than a place of chief ftrength, appears from the vicinity of 
Stanwix, the Ration in courfe upon the wall.
It is not to be doubted, but Caer- 
Luel was fortified, as it lay too near the borders not to be fubjed: to perils and 
alarms ; but we have no Roman authorities, to denominate it a regular Roman city 
or Ration ; as we find thofe neareR to the wall, on the fouth, were Olenacum, now 
called Old Carlille, near Wigton ; and Brcmetenracum, called old Perith.
The 
words of Camden and his editors are, “ That this city flouriflied in the time of 
“ the Romans, appears plainly enough from the ieveral evidences of antiquity, 
which they now and then dig up; and from the frequent mention made of it, 
by the writers of thofe times.
And even after the ravages of the Pids and 
Scots, it retained fomething of its ancient fplendor, and was accounted a city.”§ 
We have no authority to determine what was the fize or form of this place in 
diRant antiquity.

After 
CARLISLE.
589 
-After the retreat of the Romans, we may naturally conceive, this city would 
foon be evacuated by the Britons, and dedroyed and laid wafte by the northern 
nations, who made conftanc irruptions, and at length extended their rapine and 
devallation into the fonthern, and interior parts of Britain, till reprefled by the 
coming in of the Saxon allies.
It \\ould even be a confiderable time after their 
introdudion, before they could extend their arms to thefe weftern parts.
During 
this period, and in the darknefs in which the hiftory of thofe ages is involved, 
we are left to conjedure, that this now flourifning city lay m afhes and ruin, till 
**'”»** Egfrid poflelfing the diadem of Northumbria, carried his conqueft to the 
wcricin ocean.
The Britons in this mou-ntainous country, long retained their 
natural ferocity, and fupported their uncivilized liberty and independance.
Egfrid 
had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom ; and from that period 
we g un Tome degree of certainty in the hiftory of this place.* 
'I'he firlf certain account we have of Carlifle, is in the feventh century of the 
ChriHian aera.
It appears,, that in Egfrid’s reign, it became a place of confider- 
able ffrcngch and confequence; he having caufed it to be rebuilt, and fortified 
with a wall.t Camden fays, “ in 6 19, Egfrid, King of Northumberland, gave ic 
“ to the famous 3t Cuthbert, in thefe words ; 1 have likeivife bejlowed upon hun the 
city called Lu^ubaHia, zvitb the lands fifteen miles about it” and quotes Symeoii 
Dunelm.
This is a palpable error, for Cuthbert’s confecration was in 685.
The 
words of Symeon are, “ Et quia ilia terra minus fufficiens erar, Lugubaliam que 
** Luel vocatur, in circuita xv.
miliaria habentum in augrnentum fufeepit; ubi 
etiam fanctimonialium congregatione ftabilita.
Reginam dato habitu religionis 
“ confecravit, et inprofedlu divinae fervitutis fcolas inftituit.’’^] Bede fays, the 
citizens carried Cuthbert to fee the wails of their city, and a well of admirable 
vvorkmanfhip, built in it by the Romans.
“ Several writers of St. Cuthbert’s life, 
“ tell us of that holy man’s founding here, A.
D. 686, a convent of monks, a 
“ fchool, and an abbey of nuns; but from Bede’s Life of St. Cuthbert, cap.

it 
** feems as if the monallery here, to which Qiieen Emenburga retired, w'as in be- 
“ mg before St. Cuthbert’s coming to Carlifle.”§ 
After 
* “ Bede fays, that Northumberland and the Pi'fts, Scotts, and Britons, in the northern parts, vvae 
** inperfefl peace, one with another, in the year of God 731 ; and that there was fuch refpeft and re- 
“ verence given to religion, that perfons of the bed quality delired to be admitted to the offices of the 
“ church : but not long after this, the Britons or Cumbees, who had been fcattered in thefe parts ever 
“ fince the recefs of the Roman legions, began to unite themfelves under a government of their own, cal- 
“ ling their province or kingdom, Cumberland, or the land of the Cumbri.” Dr. Todd’s MS.

^ “ In the north-weft corner of the Foreft of Englewood, ftands the ancient city of Carlifle.
It lay 
Tvafte for the moft part of 2CO years before the Conqueft, faving a few cottages among the ruins, inha- 
bited by Irifli and Scots.
After the Danes had wafted the country with fire and fword, William Rufus 
returnlug that way from Alnwick, when he had made peace with the King of Scotland, feeing the place 
to be of ftrength, convenient to entertain his forces at any time, againft Scotland, commanded the fame 
to be redtified, and to be fortified with walls and with a caftle.
This was about the latter end of his 
reign, but he was prevented by an untimely death, before he could perform all that which he intended.
CARLISLE- 
sgo 
After Egfrid’s having reftored the city, and fortified it with a wall, it became 
an appendage to the fee of Lindisfarn, by the royal gift thereof to St. Cuthbert ; 
and fo continued till the year 1 130, when King Henry I.
conftituted it a feparate 
bifhoprick.
By Dugdales Monafticon, it appears, that in 1082, in the ads of 
William Carilepho, bilhop of Durham, it was (tiled part of the diocefe of the 
bifiiop of Durham.
It is afTerted, that in 1066, William the Conqueror ilfued his 
mandate to the inhabitants of Cumberland at large, and of Carlifie in particular, 
that they fiiould continue fubjed to the bifiiop of Durham as their diocefian, from 
whofe predecefTors they had received Chrifiianity.
So far we are allowed to fpeak of this city from the loofe records of antiquity ; 
from the time of the Conquefi; we have more certainty, and evidence of undenia- 
ble authenticity to guide us.
Camden’s defcription of the fiteof Carlifie is to this 
purport, “ Betw-een the confluence of thefe rivers (Peteril and Cauda) the ancient 
city of Carlifie has a delightful, pleafant fituation ; bounded on the north with 
Eden, on the eafi with Peteril, and on the weft with Caude; and, befides thefe 
“ natural fences, it is fortified with a ftrong ftone wall, a caftle, and citadel.
It 
** is of .an oblong form from weft to eaft: to the weft is a pretty large caftle, which 
was built by William the fccond, and repaired by King Richard III.
as (hould 
** feem by the arms."” The period of time between the reign of Egfrid, and the 
coming of the Danes, affords a fufficient number of years to fupport a prefumption, 
that this place would greatly improve in importance and power, before the pro- 
grefs of thofe ravagers ; but the advance only (erved to aggrandize its woe; for 
when thofe invaders had pofiTeffed themfelves of thefe northern parts, w'e find 
Carlifie again fmoking in her a(hes:J and fo complete was the dcftruiftion, that 
(he lay overwhelmed in her defolation, till the time of William the Conqueror, 
when one of his followers is faid to have rebuilt fome parts of the city, founded, 
or reftored the ancient religious fociety there, and dedicated the houle to the 
• honour of the BleflTed Virgin, of which he became the chief : and, in confequence 
• ^)f thefe pious works, it was, that the Conqueror iffued the foregoing mandate, in 
which Carlifie was particularly fpecified ; that this body of religious (hould he 
•for the good of the city : yet he placed there a colony of Dutchmen, which were Ihortly thence tranf- 
lated into the Hie of Anglefey, by him or his next fucceffor, Henry Beauclerk, his brother; and inftead of 
them, a new regiment of fouthern men, of Eflex, Kent, Middlelex, and other parts of the realm, weie 
brought to fupply their place, and to Inhabit the counties of Northumberland and Wellmorland, under 
the leading of Ranulph de Mefehines, fitter’s fon to Hugh Lupus, or Loup, firft Earl of Cheftci.” 
Tanner.
^ “ When they had laid watte Northumberland, their violence was fuffered to proceed as far as this 
“ city, and.lay it in utter ruin ; .burning the town, throwing down the walls, and killing man, woman, 
“ and child, the Inhabitants being then very numerous.
In that ftate it was left for near 200 years, 
“ without an Inhabitant, but fome few Iritti, who lodged themfelves among the ruins.
The very foun- 
“ dations of the city were fo buried in the earth, that it is faid, large oaks grew upon them ; and this is 
“ not only attetted by our hiftorians, but alfo made out by fome difeoveries that have been lately made of 
“ large unhewn oak trees buried 10 or i2 feet below ground ; one of which was found by Mr. Robert

King William Rufusf having entertained a perfeft idea of the importance of 
this place, on the weflern part of the frontier, as he favv Newcallle was on the 
eaftern ; and feeing the infant works of Walter proceeding profperoufly, he un- 
dertook to reftore the city, and caufed many public buildings to be eredled; the 
whole of which, he directed, fliould be defended by a complete circiimvaliation, 
and a ftrong fortrefs : the care of executing his plan he configned to Walter, and 
under his infpedion, it is alledged, the works were carried on.
From the appear- 
ance'of feveral parts of the fortifications, one is led to determine, they are the 
work of that aera ; for the Normans brought into this country, fome of the beft 
workmen the ifland ever poflefTed, as appears by the remains of many of the 
northern cartles, whofe dates are well aftertained ; and there is fo great a fimili- 
tude of the form and mode of architcdlure in the great cower of the caffle of Car- 
lifle, that thence, by a common obferver, its date may be afeertained.
In the 
ftdes of this tower, in feveral parts, are placed the arms of England, but thefe 
feem to denote no more than the reparations made by the feveral fovereigns.§ 
It is faid he firft placed here a colony of Flemings, and mod: probably they 
were the artificers who raifed the fortifications ; for foon after, we read of the city 
being reftored and walled, with the defence of a fortrefs added thereto: we find 
the Flemings were removed to North Wales, and the ifle of Anglefea, and the 
king replaced them with a colony of South Britains, men ufed to hufbandry, and 
f But all the ecclefiaflical baildings, with the city and adjacent country, being laid wafte in the Danlfh 
ware, the city was rebuilt and fortified by King William Rufus ; and Walter, a Norman pried, being 
made by that king governor of the city, began a monattery to the honours of the blefled Virgin MarV

To this 
colony all the records exiting attribute the firfl; tillage that w\as known, in the

Carlifle were Englifli: and what follows in the Saxon Chronicle, Darlaptj to rilianne, 
“ ftrengthens the conjeAure, as exprelTing the errand upon which they were fent,

to cultivate thofe parts,” This was deep policy in William, as it was in- 
troducing a certain employment, which would naturally call together many fettlers ; 
and render his kingdom lefs fubjedt to annoyances from a.

The cultivation 
introduced by William, had not made fo rapid a progrefs in the courfe of feventy 
years, as to have cleared the neighbourhood of Carlifle of wood ; for by the char- 
ter of King Henry II.
the citizens had the privilege of taking fuel, and building 
timber from the Royal Forefl: of Carlifle.
Camden fays, “ Lugubalia now grown populous, had,' as they write, its Earl, 
** or rather Lord Ralph Mefehines, from whence defeended the earls of Chefter.” 
After the death of Richard, Earl of Chefler, who was drowned with the king’s 
*» children, Ranulph Mefehines removed to Chefler.
and was Earl thereof.
Pre-

county to David, King of Scots, to procure his aid againft King Henry U.
right 
heirs to the late king, as fon to Maud the Emprefs, daughter and foie heir to 
Henry I.
But the Scots fecrctly favoured him for his right’s fake; and for 
that he had made the faid Henry Fitz Emprefs knight at Carlifle.
Yet accepting 
“ the gift of the county, W'hercunto he pretended his own right, before .
granted to 
his anceflors by the Saxon kings, he made his eldefl fon, Henry Fitz David, Earl 
“ of Huntington and Carlifle ; which Henry founded the abbey of Holm Cultram 
<« in the time of King Stephen, his father confirming* the grant of the revenues 
wherewith he endowed that houfe, and fo his fon Malcom, King of Scots, after

After Henry Fitz David and King Stephen were dead.
King Henry 
“ Fitz Emprefs took Carlifle and the county from the Scots, and granted to the 
“ city the firfl liberties I hear of, that they enjoyed after the Conqueft.
But his 
“ charter was burned by a cafual fire that happened in the town, which defaced a.
“ great part of the fame, and all the records of antiquity of that place.” — Dentov.
The next perfon we read of in hiflory, who had the title of Earl of Carlifle,

— About the feafl; of the purification of our Lady, Andrew dc 
Herkeley, late made Earl of Carlifle, under colour of peace, found that he would marrie Robert Brufe 
his filler, whereupon the king reputed him tratour, and caufed him to be taken by his truftye frinde, Sir 
Antonie de Lucy, who fent him in irons ftiait to London, where he was judged before Sir Antonie de 
Lucy in this manner : he was ledde to the barre as an Earle worthily appareled, v/ith his fworde girt 
about him, hofed, booted, and fpiiired, &c.
unto whom Sir Antonie fpokc in this manner; “ Sir Andrew, 
“ quoth he, the king, for thy valiante fervice, hath donne thee greate honor, and made thee Earl of 
Carlifle ; fince which time, thoue, as a tratour to thy Lord the King, leddell his people, that Ihould have 
hoipe him at the battail of Beigliland, away, by the country of Copland, and through the eailedome of 
Lancafter ; by which means our Lord the King was difeomfited there of the Scots, through thy treafoa 
and falfenelTe, whereas if thoue haddcll come betimes, he had had the vlilorie ; and this treafon thou 
committed for the greate fome of gold and filver, that thoue receaved of James DowglalTe, a Scot, the 
king's enemie.
Our Lord the King will, therefore, that the order of knighthoode, by the which thou 
neceaved all thine honor and woorelhip upon thy b®dy be brought to nought, and thy date undoone, that 
other knights of lower degree may after thee beware, and take example hereafter truly to ferve.” Then 
commanded he to hew his Ipurres from his heeles, then to breake his fworde over his headde, which the 
king had given him to keepe and defende his land therewith, when he made him earle.
After this he 
let uncloath him of his furred tabard, and of his whoode, of his coat of arms, and alfo of his girdle, and 
when this was done.
Sir Antonie faid unto him.
“ Andrew, quoth he, now art thou no knight, but 
a knave ; and for thy treafon, the king will that thou fliall be hanged and drawen, and thy headde fmlt- 
ten ofFe from thy body, thy bowels taken out of thy body and burned before thee, and thy body quar- 
tered : and thy headde being fmitten offe, afterward to be fet upon London bridge, and thy four quarters 
lhall be fent unto four good towns of England, that all other may beware by thee.” Which was ac- 
cordingly done.

It has undergone .grtat change, as will be ftievvnin the fequel.
The pfefeht edifice 
confills of the eaft limb of the crofs,.
being the chancel, and the crols aile or tran— 
fept with the tower : the greateft part of the weft limb of the crofs, having been 
pulled down in the civil wars, 1641 : with the materials they created a guard- 
every gate of the city, and one in the marlcct-place ; and two batteries in 
the caftlc.
The circular arches and maftive round columns, " whofe fhafts are 
“ only fourteen feet two inches high, and circumference full feven and a half,”* 
which remain of the weft limb and tranfept, are of the heaA^ieft order of the 
Saxon architedure; and at the firft fight, teftify the difterent ages in which this 
part and the chancel were eredted : indeed the architediure denotes an earlier aera 
than the time of William Rufus, and probably here is a part of the work of the 
age of St. Cuthbert : but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode 
of building, which might prove fo ancient a date.
The weft end is faid to have 
been, in length, 135 feet from the crofs aile, of which ^3 feet remains, it being

years after the Refloration made in the proceeding reign ; but it was ten years be- 
fore Bifliop Strickland raifed the belfrey, v hich would have been an ufelefs work, 
when the church was in ruins.
Thefe contradidlions and ambiguities, we are at 
prefent obliged to leave unfolved.
The choir is 737 feet in length, and, with the fide ailcs, 71 feet broad: the 
crofs aile or tranlept is 28 feet broad, fa that the length of the church, when 
entire, was exacfHy 300 feet within.
The choir is of fine Gothic archite^fture, 
with light columns, remarkably beautiful.
The flails are garnifhed.
with taber- 
nacle work; (the o.'-gan is placed at the crofs fereen, which contains but a narrow 
and low entrance, and is a gieat injury to this fine edifice.) By late repairs it is 
greatly embelliflicd, being wainfeotted with oak, from the fialls round the whole 
cafi: end of the choir, in a fimple fiile, after the old order.
The open gates 
leading into the fide ailcs, are old and much broken, but flicw' excellent light 
Tracery work, finely ornamented.
The bifliop’s throne is not magnificent, 
but yet elegant and fiately.
The breadth of the choir and ailes being yr 
feet, correfponds well with the height, which to the center of the ceiling is 75 
feel.
The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood,, painted and erna- 
menred with arms and devices of the feveral patrons and contributors to the work ; 
with the arms of France and England, were thofe of the Piercys, Lucys, Warrens^ 
and Mowbrays.
The old wood lining remains in the crofs aile, and fhews what 
was the former figure, and the ornaments of the choi'’: but the outward roof 
and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay, when repairs were 
made, in 1764 the ceiling was fiuccoed, in the form of a groined vault, which is 
a great advantage to its appearance.* The eaft window is large, being 48 feet in 
height, and 30 in breadth, ornamented W'ith fine pilafiers ; but it has no cafi: of 
folcmnity, by means of a border of coloured glafs thrown round it, of yellow, red, 
and green, which looks gaudy.
f 
“ In the ailcs on each fide, are fome firange legendary paintings of the hifiory 
" of St, Anthony, Sr. Cuthbert, and St. Augufiine: one reprefents the faint vi- 
fltcd by an unclean fpirit, w ho tempts him in a mofi: indecent manner.” jf

; the reft was made up by the Dean and 
Chapter.
. 
f The official duties of miarriages, chriftenings, churchings, and funerals, are performed in the parifh 
church, the ordinary duties of the Sabbath, and prayers twice a-day through the year in the choir.
On 
tlie burial of any of the members of the choir, the corps is carried into tliat part of the church.
The

The crofs aile from north to louth, is 124 feet; in the center is a tower, in 
height 127 feet, which originally fupported a fpire of lead, thirteen or fourteen 
feet high, which being gone greatly to decay, was totally removed foon after the 
Reftoration.
The pillars of the choir are cluflered, and in excellent proportion; the arches 
are pointed ; in the inner mouldings of the capitals, are figures and flowers in 
pierced work, of light carting, and the infide of the arches are prettily ornamented.
Two galleries run above the fide ailes, but with windows only in the upper: that 
in the caft end has a magnificent fimplicity.
When the choir was rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III, indulgences

“ the honour of St. Cuthbert of Durcfin, who of ancient times was lord of the fame

probable it was a concealed trcafure, intended to be fecured againfl the DaneSj or 
ibinc other ravagers ; for when the foundations were making for the prefent new 
edifice, and the workmen had gone below the foundations ot the old church, they 
dilcovered the remains of a fiill more ancient creefiion, and took up fevcral pieces 
of broken fculpture; among the refi: the figure of a nun with her veil or hood, 
well cut and in good prefervation, which we faw' in the garden of George Mounfey, 
Elq. of Carlifie ; fo that it fiiould feem the old nunnery flood there.|| It feems that 
Walter’s foundation w as entirely a new one, and not a revival of St. Cuthbert’s 
infiitution ; for, in Tanner we find “ Here was a houfe of Gray, or Francifcaii 
“ friars,* before A.
D. 1390;!
and alfo a houfe of Black friars,^ founded here 
53d Henry III.§ 
Walter, the Norman, laid the foundation of the priory, which he dedicated to 
the BlefTcd Virgin: it is faid he became the head of the fociety which he had in- 
fiituted; but authors of great authenticity, Ipeak of his work as being incomplete 
at the time of his ucath ; and that King Henry I.
in the fecond year of his reign, 
took it under his patronage, finilhed it, and eiidovved it, A.
D. i loi, and therein 
placed regular canons of the order of St. Augufiine, appointing Athelwald his 
confefTor and chaplain the firft prior.
Notwithflanding Denton’s account, we arc 
convinced there was a fucceflion of thirty priors after Athelwald, before the time 
of the dillolution, Athelwald afterwards being made bifiiop of this diocefe, was 
fuccceded in the priory by Waller, another chaplain of the kings’, who had taken 
upon him the regular habit ; and being a rigorous difciplinarian, he baniflied all 
^ This fculpture is now loft.
— In Mr. Mounfey's, and ether gardens adjoining, many foundations of 
houfes, fragments of pottery, quantities of oak-wood, human bones, 6cc.
have been dug up at various 
times.
This ground is upon the eaft fide of linglifh ftreet, and called tlie Grey-Friars; and up the 
weft fide, adjoining tlie walls, from St. Cutlibert’s church to the jail, is called the Black-Friars ; and 
limilar things have been dug up here alfo : a few years ago, in making a drain from a houfe here towards 
the waHs, the top of an arch was eifeerned; fome of the ftonts being lernoved, we difeovered a fpaclous 
arched rocm, one fde of which nfted upon the walls, in height 15 feet, in breadth 12 feet, and inlength- 
about 3c feet ; the end was narrower and lower, and fuppofed to have been conneflcd with other fimilar 
rooms, but the paititions built up.
There were four funnels went upright to the foot path of the walls, 
but covered at the top with flags, and iron grates in the funnels.
On the oppohte fide, between two of 
the arches, a horizontal funnel, about two feet wnde and three feet h’gh, went towards the city ; this was 
fsaichcd a confiderable way, till the peifon w’as entangled witli rubbdh which choaked it up: beneath this 
eaflage, the floor was flagged and walled in about 1 8 inches high on each iidc, and a conduit went through 
the city walls on the oppofite fide ot the vault ; this was opened by removing the earth on the out fide, 
about four feet deep, and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault.
Proceeding 
to remove the wet rubbith wh'ch was colledled, the workmen were intcirupted by the gunner of the 
caftle, who affumed a higher power than Mr. Mead, the ilore keeper, at whofe inllance the fearch was 
making ; and the place was immediately fliut up and never (ince opened.
We have accurate drawings 
and iT.eaUirer.ients, which we have deferred laying before the public till a full inveftigation of this myfte- 
rious place be made ; we are confident there are many other fuch kind of vaults in the neighbourhood.

In the dlftant age in which the firll Bifhop of Carlifle arofe, little can be gathered of the virtues or 
inemorable aftions of men, though even thus eminent : this obfeurity is greatelt in a country which was 
almoft a conftant feene of military exploits, depredations, and bloodOied.
Catlifle, though a chief barrier 
againft the Scots, fuffered many changes of fortune, and the life of its bifhop was frequently diflutbed and 
full of trouble.

five to this prelate, and feveral of his immediate fucccflbrs.
We find him indeed bufy In one ecclefiafti* 
caf matter, in wlilch he was immediately adverfary to the will of his fovereign.
He was one of the electors 
of Hemy Murdac, abbot of Fountanis to be archbifhop of York.
The king’s difpleafiire was fuch at 
this trnnfaftion, that he denounced vengeance againft all thofe who were concerned in it ; but fuch was 
this prelate’s contempt of the fovereign’s menaces and felf-confidence, that he received Murdac as his 
metropolitan, when he came to vifit David King of Scotland, then refident in this city.f He departed 
this life, A.
D. 1 155, H and was fucceeded by 
EPISCOPU 3 IL 
Bernard, of whom we know little but his epifcopal adfs.
— In 1 169, he dedicated the church of St.
Mary Magdalene of Lancrcoft.
He remained bifhop of Carlifle to the time of his death, which hap- 
pened, A.
D. 1 186.
From the long continued vacancy of the fee, it appears evidently, that it was in a 
fad unfettled flaie, and full of difeord and troubles, as well as meanly revenued ; for, by the regifter of 
AVetheral, it is fhewn that King Henry II.
being prefent at Carlifle, tendered the biftioprick to Paiiliniis 
de Leedes, and (as fuch was even an early influence In the ecclefiaftical affairs) offered to augment the 
income with 300 marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scar’orough, with the chapel of Tick- 
hill, and two manors adjacent to Carlifle : but even with fuch augmentations Paulinus refufed it.^ It 
continued vacant to the beginning of the 1 3tb centuiy, and King John gave the revenues of the bifliop- 
rick to fupport the archbifhop of Sclavonia.
In 1203, the Pope intermeddled with the income of the 
fee, granting it to the archbifhop of Regula, who was obliged to abandon his own, and was deflitute of 
fupport.
This aft of the papal authority was confirmed by the king.
The continued vacancy let in a 
flood of enormities among the religious here.
The canons publickly announced their contempt of the 
papal authority, and the cenfures of his legate ; in defiance of all the interdifts and fentences denounced 
to the contrar)', they perfifled in celebrating divine fervices, and all holy offices of the facraments ; but 
their arrogance and impropieties did not ceafe there ; they fwore fealty to the king of Scots, an avowed 
enemy to the crown of England, and one in open oppofition to the authority of the holy fee, In confe- 
qucnce of thefe licentious afts, they fet up an interdifted and excommunicated clerk for their bifhdp, con- 
trary to the will of their lawful fovereign, and the pope’s legate ; and feizing the revenues of the bifhoprick, 
applied them according to their own wiil.
Enormities like thefe were to be correfted with the fevereft 
racafures.
The council of King Henry III.
applied to Pope Honorius III.
totally to remove thefe 
offenfive canons, and place prebends in their room ; to augment the revenues of the fee, which were fo 
fmall that no able and loyal perfon would accept of the biflioprlck, and to difplace the perfon who had.

perfons have affirmed, that before the fettlement of Mortmain, 7th King Edward I.
impro- 
priations were very rare in England ; yet this bifliop, who died above an hundred years before the enaifting that law, 
confirmed the churches of M'etheral and Warwick, St. Michael, and St. I.awrence, Appleby, Kirby Stephen, Ormef- 
head, Morland, Clibburn, Bromfield, Croglin, and the hermitage of S.t. Andrew, in the parilh of Kirkland, to the abbot

EPISCOPUS III.
Hugh, abbot of Belieu, the eleft of Gallo the legate, came to this fee when diftraftcd with the offen- 
ces of the clergy ; yet we do not find that religion was the lead abbetted by this prelate : the manners of 
the religious were not improved, or the errors of thofe under him reformed; nay, he feemed even doubt- 
ful of his own authority, when in the grant made by him to the convent of St. Mary’s in York, A.
D. 
1220, he fiyles himfelf, “ Hugo dci gratia Karieolenfis ecclefioe vocatus facerdos fo the regifter of 
Wetheral fhews.
He had the favour of his fovereign, and was one of his furcties.
In the treaty entered 
into with Alexander, King of Scotland.* The pope was petitioned to afiill in the reftoration of the 
churches of Penrith, Newcaitle, Rothbury, Corbridge, and Whittingham, to the fee ; and in the king’s 
letters on this occafion he ftlles him, “ Fidelis noller, cui multo tenemur debito” — “ ac fanfta; Romanse 
ecclefiss devotiiIimus.’'(| There cannot be a more certain channel for obtaining the true hiftory of any 
man’s life, than the wr tings < f cotemporaries and neighbours ; by fuch, this prelate fo much Ifievoted to 
the church, as he is ftjled by the king, is accufed of alienating the pofl'cflions of the fee ; nay, of making 
fraudulent diftributions thereof ; and the chronicle of I.anercotl palTes this dreadful fentence on his un- 
timely death, “ That Iry the jufi judgment cf God he perijloed miferahly, at the abbey of le Forte, in Bur- 
“ gundy, as he was returning from Rome.” Even if this is the language of truth, it is not that of 
charity ; and Ihccks the r eader, when he perceives It comes from the records of the fcriptorcs of ^ re- 
ligious houfe -there Is a rancour rn it that gives a jealoufy, fome latent caufe had didfated the feverc

Carllfle caufed the convent of Lanercoft to rellnquifti a refer ved rent, iffuing out of the church of Burgh 
upon Sands, as not having been obtained by canonical I'ules.
If fuch a caufe didtated the rancorous con- 
demnation and judgment, what deteftation ought we not to liold thefe Impious men in.
We do not find that the epifcopacy of this place was to be better filled by the fucceflbr of Hugh,

«f the manor of Dalfton : to this, in 1 232, by the king’s charter, was added, the office of treafurer of the 
exchequer of England ; with power of executing that duty, by deputy of his own nomination.
But 
Walter held this dilliiiguifhed office but a very fhort time, though his chaiter contained an appointment 
for life ; he was difcharged in a difgraceful manner without any caufe afligned ; his grants, the initru- 
ments of his office, were ordered to be cancelled, and he was fined tool, the king appointing Peter de 
Rival his fucceflbr ; and commanded S.
de Segrave, his juiliciar, to put him in poffeffion of the treafury, 
in cafe Walter refilled to deliver the keys, and all things belonging thereto, by inventory and view, and 
teftimony of true men.
The affeftlons and frow ns of princes are fo fluftuating and uncertain, and their 
caufes fo frequently arife from the fecret influence of villains, who Iport with their fovereign’s weaknefles, 
that we Ihould not from thence deduce the charadler of any man ; this reverfe of fortune, fome attribute to 
the intrigues of Peter, Bifhop of Wiuchefter, who had great influence with the king.
Walter would 
have repaired to Rome for redrefs, but having got on board a vefl'el at Dover, he was arrefted bv the 
officers of the crown, and brought on Ihore.
The Blfliop of London was a fpeclator of this outrage", and 
immediately pronounced a fentence of excommunication againft thofe concerned in this arrell : and fo 
earnefliy did he engage in this bufinefs, that he hafted to Hereford where the king held his court, and 
with the alfillance of feveral bilhops there prefent, renewed his fentence.:}; But it was not long before 
Walter was rellored to royal favour, being a fultable inftrument for the times, in the power of his prince.
J 
He was a chief inftrument in the contraft entered into between the king and the Earl of Winchefter’s 
daughter.
We find his name a.mong the witnefles to the king’s ratification of the great charter : and 
Inch confidence was at length placed In him, that he was appointed fpiritual tutor to Prince Edward, 
A. D.

He was joined in commiffion with the Archbifnop of York and William de Cantelupe, 
as lords juftices of the realm in the king’s abfence.
This Is the lalt public charafter we find him in ; and 
in 1246 he refigned his biflioprick, and became one of the order of preaching friars at Oxford, where he

“ The Cornu Eburneum tliey have yet in the cathedral of Carlifle, a fymbol, very probably, of fomc of King Henry Ps 
grants to the priory ; but in none of thofc grants, of vvhich any copy is now extant, do thole tythes appear.
’J he cere- 
mony of inveftiture with a horn, or other like fymbol, is very ancient, and was in ufe before there were any written 
charters.
We read of Ulf a Danifli prince, who gave all his'lands to the church of York, and the form of the endow- 
ment was this; ha brought the horn out of which he ufually drank, and before the high altar, kneeling devoutly, drank 
the wine, and by that ceremony enfeoffed the church with all his lands and revenues.
King Canute, another Dane, gave lands at Pufey in Berkfhire, to the family of that name there, with a horn folempljr 
delivered as a confirmation of the grant ; which horn, it is faid, is ftill there to he fecn.
So King Edward the confclfor, granted to Nigel the huntfman, an hide of land, called DereKide; .and a wood, called 
Halewood, with the cuftody of the foreft of Bernevvcod, to hold of the king, to him and his heirs, by one horn, which 
is the charter of the faid foreft.
So that, not the Danes only, but the Englifh Saxons alfo, were acquainted with this ancient cuftor.r. Thus Ingulphus, 
abbot of Crovvland, who lived in the time of William the Conqueror, acquaints us that it continued down to his time.
• 
He tells us that many eftates were granted by w'ord only, without writing, as' by delivery of a fword, an helmet, a horn 
or cup, or fuch like ; but this mode, he fays, in after times was changed.
Ulf’s horn at York, when the reformation began in King Edward the Vi's, time, was fwept away amongfl other 
coftly ornaments, and fold to a goldfmith, who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned, and 
the gold chain which was affixed to it.
After which time the horn itfelf, cut in ivory, of an Oiilagon form, came into 
the hands of General Fairfax ; who being a lover of antiquities, preferved it during the confufions of the civol wars ; 
whofe memory is d,eferved!y honoured for other generous adlions of this nature; fuch as allowing Mr. Dodfworth, the 
antiquarian, a yearly falary to preferve the inferiptiors in churches, the giving his valuable manuferipts to the univerflty 
of Oxford, and his preferving the public library there, as he did the cathedral at York from being fpoilcd and defaced 
after the furrender of the city.
And he dying in 1671, this horn came into the pofleffion of his next kinfman.
Lord 
Fairfax, who ornamented it anew, and reftored it to its aneient repofitory, where it now remains a ;icble monument of 
niodcrij as w'ell as ancient piety.

This blfliop was in great confidence with his fovereign, and received feveral marks of his royai favour.
He was joined in conimillion with the bifnop of Caithncfs, to colledf tenths within the kingdom of Scot- 
land.
He was one of the king’s moil confidential commiffioners, for adjulling the claims to the crown 
of Scotland, on the i 3th of June and 14th of Auguft, 1291.
He appears a witnefs to the king’s claim 
of light to tlie kingdom of Scotland, on the death of Queen Margaret, v.'hich was fubferibed at Nor-

Edvs-aid with the before-mentioned princefs ; and was an adlive agent in many other of the molt impor- 
tant Hate tranfadlions of his time.
Notwithllanding his coming to the fee, in the lingular m.anner he 
did, we do not difeover that he ever betiayed any undue influence of the holy fee, or any finlller attempts 
to aggrandize the papal authority in this country, by afts which could infringe the rights of his fovereign, 
or the people, through any undue extention of the authority of Rome here In March 1291— 2, he fuf-

was prefent in November 1292, when fcntence was given for John Baliol, and he did homage for his 
kingdom.* In 1294, he was emiflary of King Edward to the court of Scotland, and had letters of fafe 
condudl for his journey.
By the pope’s authority he Was the coiledlor of tenths in the Scotch diocefe.
He entertained the king and his train at his callle of Rofe for a confiderable time.
He was governor of 
the caftle of Carlille, A.

D. 1305, to pronounce fentence of 
excommunication, by bell, book, and candle, againft Robert Brus, Earl of Carrick, for the murder of

In the year following, he was one in the commiflion to ab- 
folve all perfons for their offences againit King Edward’s enemies in Scotland, wounding the clergy and 
fpoillng their churches.
|| He was petitioner to the pope for the canonization of Sir Thomas de Cante-

In 1 308, he was fummoned to attend the coronation of King Edward IT.
He was fhut up in Carlille by the blockade formed by Edw'ard Bruce’s forces In 1314, and obliged to 
appear by proxy in the parliament at Wellminller.-)- He was one of the plenipotentiaries of the king,

He was of a refraflory and contentious dlfpofitlon ; and though not employed in a political capacity, 
had bufinefs enough upon his hands, in his difputes and litigations with his clergy.
He difturbed the

He came to tliis-

the litigious and unhappy difpofitlon of the clergy.
He was continually fubjeft to alarms from the Scots, 
in.confequence of the king of England’s unfortunate expeditions and unfuccefsful arms ; and, added to 
this, he had gained the contempt and hatred of that people before the advancement to the fee : fo that, 
it Isfald, his ordinations were held in very diftant quarters of the kingdom, and he was frequently out of 
this diocefe ; and to render his life Hill more diftrefsful, he was Involved in innumerable fuits with bis 
clergy.

In 1337, he was befet by ruffians ashepafled through Penrith, who would have aflaffinated hjm ; and 
in the fray feveral of his retinue were wounded.
f In the month of 06 iober, his palace of Rofe Caftle 
was burnt by the Scots, and the adjacent country fwept of its cattle and flocks, the crops deftroyed, and 
the whole adjoining lands laid wafte.f He had great trouble in the colIeAion of tenths : he fuffered a 
fevere fentence from the court at York, upon his refufing an eftabliflied vicar to St. Mary’s In Carlifle.

of commiffioner with Richard, blfhop of Durham, and others, to treat with the Scots, touching the fet- 
llement of peace and commerce.

an eleftion made by the chapter (under the royal licence and confirmation) of the prior of Carlifle, John 
de Horncaftle ; but the king was pleafed to revoke thofe powers, In compliance with the didlates of the 
holy fee, and to confirm the confecration of Gilbert.
He was one of the commiffioners appointed by the king to treat for the ranfom of David, king of 
Scotland, and for the, eftabllfliment of peace between the two nations.
In 1359, he was joined with 
Thomas de Lucy as wardens of the weftern marches ; and in the fucceeding years, was one of the com- 
xniffipners in the memorable treaties for acknowledging David king of the Scotch dominions, and for 
making a renunciation of King Edward’s claim of fovereignty over the crown of Scotland.^— He died in

Robert Reed, A.

EPISCOPUS XV.
Thomas Merks.
— We have no evidence before us, whether lie was the nominee of the chapter, or 
otherwife : he was one of the monks of Weftminfter, and a great adherent to the unhappy monarch, 
Richard II.
In whofe will he was named an executor.
The hiftory of that particular ana is not vvanted 
to ftiew the reader from what principles he ftood an advocate In parliament for the depofed king: his 
attachment was fo warm, and his temper lo regardlefs of every thing but truth, that in the fiift feffions 
under King Henry IV.
he pronounced the fevereft condemnations on the meafures and the men, by which 
the revolution had been effefled ; and even treated the rf:igning prince with that derogation and co.a- 
tempt, that he was committed for high treafon, and deprived of his bidioprick.
J On the 23d of January, 
A. D.
1400, the king confented he Ihould be removed from the Tower to Weftminfter.
This relaxation 
of offended majefty was foon after followed by a permiflion, under letters patent, to obtain from the pope, 
in benefices of the court of Rome, appointments of the yearly amount of an hundred merks ; but epifeo.
pacy was excepted.
In 1404, we find him get inftitution to the teflory of Todenham in Gloucefterfhire.

EPISCOPUS XVI.
William Strickland, who, in 1 363, had been reje£led by h!s hollnefs ; and vvho novv came to this 
fee, 24th of Auguft, 1400.
It cannot be doubted, from the channel by which he bad his advancement, 
that he was a ftridl adherent to the Interefts of the reigning prince ; and accordingly we find his name 
among the prelates who fubfcribcd the aft of fucceffion, and affurance of the crown of England, to the 
fons of King Henry.
We alfo find him In the commiffion Iffued for the arreft and imprifonment of all 
perfons, profefling their diffatisfaftlon in the then fectlement of the crown ; and who, to encourage 
faftion and difoider, caufed it to be reported, that King Richard II.
lately depofed and dead, was ftill 
living within the dominions of Scotland, by means of which evil reports, the late adherents of that monarch 
were fpirited up to tumult and rebellion.
In faft, this was a commiffion of perfecutlon : the family of 
the unhappy monarch depofed, had confiderable interefts and conneftions of blood in the northern parts, 
and alfo much power ; fo that this commiffion was fent forth as a fcourge at once to reprefs and humble 
them ; and alfo to put them in the power of the minions of a court, whofe interefts on fuch occafions, 
may well be devifed, and whofe ufe of fuch an inftrument is known.
— Blftiop Strickland departed this 
life on the 30th day of Auguft, A.
D. 1419, after having lield the fee near twenty years.
He was in- 
terred in the cathedral of Carlifle, his monument and effigies being In the north aile.
He was fucceeded 
by

Roger Whelpdale, of a Cumberland family, a man (allowed by all writers) of great learning.
He 
had his education In Baliol College, Oxford, where he gained a fcllowfnip ; he removed into Queen’s 
College, where he was made provoft ; and on the 12th of Oftober, 1419, he was elefted biffiop of this 
diocefe, having previoufly obtained the provifion of the fee of Rome in his favour, his eleftion followed 
of courfe.
As bifhop of Carlifle, we do not find him an aftive charafter in church or ftate.
The difpofitlons made 
by his will were to pious ufes ; and his writings, though not numerous, were well received in the age he 
appeared in.

or the nature and place of his education, yet he figured in the offices of the church, in an age when many 
great charadfers flourilhed, without any other adeautages than great powers of genius and fervility of 
principles.
In the reign of King Henry VI 1 .
he was ambaffador to Spain ; he was alfo fubdean of the 
royal chapel; and in the year 1513, he was made archbifhop of Armagh in Ireland.
The Influence of 
Cardinal Wolfey obtained him many dignities ; and he wa> devoted to his fervice in return; he confulted 
our btlhop on his moR; momentous concerns, and converfed with him on matters of the highelt nature 
with the greateR familiarity.
In the melancholy reverfe of his fortune, the friendlhip was not broken, 
and the cardinal received his fupport from the bifliop’s hands.
^ In 1521, Biflrop Kyte, on his inRallation 
at CarliRe, refigned the archbifhoprick of Armagh, and took the titular bifhoprick of Thebes in Greece.*' 
He was one of the commlffioners of King Henry VIII.
to treat for a ceffation of hoRUities with Scot- 
land, and in 1526, he was one of the plenepotentlaries for eRabliRring peace with King James V.
In

cerning his marriage ; and acquiefeing with the vices and enormities of that monRer of impiety and arro- 
gance.
Launched fo far in the intrigues of a corrupt court, we fee his name mixed with thofe minions, 
who fervilely courted the king’s fmlles with the forfeiture of virtue.
He was one of the four biRiops 
who addreffed Pope Clement, the feventh, in the matter of.
the king’s divorce : but in the latter years of 
his life, after the cardinal was removed, and the political countenance of the court changed, he was

ht received his education at Eaton, till the year 1 507, when he was appointed a fcholar of King’s col- 
lege, Cambridge.
He was once proftor of that unlverfity ; and from thence he became mafter, fellow, 
and provoft of Eaton.
About the year 1529, he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford, and the fol- 
lowing year took up his doftor’s degree.
Soon after, he was appointed archdeacon of Colchefter ; and 
in the year 1537* was inftalled a canon at Windfor, and made regifter of the order of the garter.
He 
was an oppofer of Cranmer, and adhered to the Romifh profefTion of faith j indeed, in the work called

Owen Oglethorp ; who, by the inconfiftenoies in his public aftions, fee ms to have been a very wealo 
man.
He received the temporalties of this bifhoprick in the month of Oftober, in the year 1556 ; but 
the pope’s confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following.
He was born at a fmall- 
village, near Tadcafler, in the county of York, of inferior parents, and had his education in Magdalene 
College, Oxford.
In the year 1531, he was proftor of the univerfity, and foon after was entered bache- 
lor of divinity.
In the year 1535, he was chofen prefident of the college ; and in 1551, had the dlflln- 
guifhed office of vice chancellor.
He was made a canon, and foon after dean, of the royal chapel at 
Windfor ; and in the firft year of Queen Mary’s reign, he was appointed fecretary to the older of the 
garter : this was a year of great honour to him, for In it he held the prefidency of Magdalene College, 
the reftories of ^’c\^incton and Haffcly, in Oxfordfliirc ; together with the deanry of Windfor.
In 
1554, he was one of tin appointed difputants in the controverfy with Cranmer, Latimer, and Rydley ; 
and flicwed lilrufelf a ncll inveterate adverfary to the principles of reformation, and even to that humane 
rule, toleration.
In .
. we fee him afting in the inconfiltent charafter I intimated ; for, during the 
vacancy of the fee of Canterbury, when all the bifhops had refiifed to officiate in the coronation of C^cen 
Elizabeth : he only, thelovveft of the tribe, the bittereft in the meafures againfl; reformifts, and the inte- 
refls of the proteftant church ; he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illuflrious 
princefs : the lords of the council, willing that the ceremony fhould have every outward dignity, fent for 
all the pontifical robes, and enfigns of high office, ufed by the archbifhop on that folemn occafion, that 
our prelate might be duely habited for the occafion.
It is not to be reconciled, how Oglethorpe could 
be influenced to this office ; the charafter of the princefs, and her fentiments in religious matter, were no 
fccrets ; and the bifhop’s faith and fentiments were publicly avouched : the inconfiftency is not to be 
leconciled, but by the difeovery of thofe influences and private fprings of the Hate, which are long fince 
locked up in the Impenetrable regions of oblivion.
Hov/ muff he have been fnocked and confounded, 
whilft the ceremony was performing, by the command of the queen not to elevate the confecrated hoft, 
in the celebration of mafs, ufual in this fo!emn;ty, “ becaufc JJje liked it not.
Wood, with a voice of 
commiferation, would palliate the error vvith-his pity : “ For the faft, wiien he favv the iffue of the mat- 
“ ter, and both himfelf and the whole tribe of his fecrct order deprived, the churches holy laws, and 
“ faith againfl the conditions of her confecration, and acception into that royal office violated, he fore 
“ repented him all the days of his life, which were, for that fpecial caiife, both fhort and wearlforne.” 
In the firft parliament he gave his vote againfl the bills for reflitution of firft fruits, for reftonng the 
(juprcmacy, exchange of bifhops lands, and uniformity of the common prayer.
He would willingly, by 
his adherence to his old partizans, have recovered a reputation he had loft, by being a tool to the pre- 
vailing party ; and, by his unfteadinefs, he dropt to the ground between the two.
The council fined 
him 250I.
for non-attendance at Stwel’s challenge in difputailon, A.
D. 1559, as her majefty had 
commanded ; and ftiortly after he was deprived of his bifnopvick, worth 268I.

From this period of time, the bufinefsand importance of blfliops

Francis White fucceeded to the fee in December 1626.
From a Hate of obfeurity we fee him 
emerging to fame, by the zeal with which he preached againfl; the church of Rome, and by his book 
againll Fiflier.
From the ruins of the ancient church, arofe innumerable fedaries ; the great flock was 
hewn down, and from the roots iflued a multitude of ungrafted flioots, bearing unprofitable fruit ; among, 
others, the Arminian principles were introduced : this bifhop even taught them on the folemn feftival of 
Chriflmas, in the chapel-royal, in the hearing of his fovereign, and foon after was tranflated to the fee of 
Norwich : fo formidable was the growth of innovations in religion, and arminianifm in particular, that 
they occafioned a parliamentary inquiry.
From his fervour againfl the papifts, he was employed by the 
king, as a fpy upon the condud of the countefs of Denbeigh, who was much inclined to llften to the rules 
of that faith ; to reward him for his affiduity in that duty, he firft was made dean of Carlifle, and then 
appointed to the bifhoprick.
He did not flop at Norwich, but was advanced to the fee of Ely in 1631, 
and departed this life fix years afterwards.
Upon his tranflation to Norwich, he was fucceeded in the-

In 1615, he 
took his degree in divinity, and was elefted provoft after he had diftinguiflied himfelf in Devonfhire by 
his puritanical doftrines.
He was one of the king’s chaplains, and was confecrated bifhop of this fee ia s 
March 1628, and died in the year 1641.
EPISCOPUS XLI.
James Usher his fucceflbr in the bifhoprick of Carlifle, was a man of deep erudition, and a zealous 
proteftant, without bigotry and fanaticifm, too much the tindfure of the age.
He held the revenues of 
this biihoprick, in commendam, by the grant of King Charles I.
as a compenfation for his great fuffer- 
ings in his archbifhopriok of Armagh in Ireland, by the commotions In that kingdom.
He was, by 
birth, an Irifhman, and had his education in the univerfity of Dublin.
He was promoted to the bifhop- 
rick of Meath in 1 620, and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbifhoprick.
With difficulty, 
and a parfimonious hand, he fubfifled on the revenues of our fee, diminifhed and exhaufted as they were 
by the armies of England and Scotland, alternately quartering in this county ; at length the feizure which 
was made by parliament on all the lands of bifliops, brought him to great diftrefs.
In confideration of 
his eminent charadler, his learning and virtuous zeal, he h.ad a penficn of 400!.
a-year granted to him, 
by parliamentary order, but it was paid very ill, infomuch that he never received it above once or twice.
He died in March 1655 at the countefs of Peterborough’s, at Rygate, Surry, In the 76th year of his 
age : Cromwell, front what principle it cannot be divined, not agreeable to his charaftcr, from fome fini-

at the interment of a man, whom he and his creatures had flarved to death ; inconfiiteut and abo-

Cromwell gave direftions that the bifhop’s library ihould not be fold 
•without his confent; but it was plundered of many of the valuable manufcripts ; the foldiers took many 
choice books at a price of their own making, and in the confufion which then diilrafted the ftatc, the 
colleftion was mutilated and greatly prejudiced.
The books which efcaped the hands of ruffians were 
given by King Cliarles II.

Richard Stern was ele£Ied, a perfon of little note by birth.
He had his ediication in Cambridge, 
was mafter of Jcfus College, and took the degree of dodlor in divinity.
He was domeftic chaplain to 
archblffiop Laud, and attended on the fcaffold at his execution.
He was a prifoner in the tower with 
feveral others, upon a complaint made by Cromwell, who was then one of the burgefles of Cambridge, 
that they had conveyed the college plate for the king’s relief at York : from this caufc he was difpofleffed 
of his feveral appointments, and lived in obfcurity till the reftoration.
In 1664 he was tranflated to 
York, and died there in 1683.
The charatler given of him by biffiop Burnet, we think ought to receive 
great credit from the known integrity of the writer ; and he intimates that “ he ‘was a four', ill-tempered 
7 ?ian, and war chiefly fltidious of rneafures to enrich his family : he <u<ar particularly attached to the court 
and fervile in adopt ins’ the rneafures then moved in; that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of Tork, 
“ and was f tangly fufpetded of popery." Nicholfon and Burn have attempted to refeue his charadler by 
the publication of a letter which they fay was written from York to his fucceflbr at Carlifle ; but is 
anonymous, and if it is from the hand of any perfon of note, it was as eafy to fubferibe the name, to 
give it weight and authority, as to publiffi the fentences to give him a fuperflcial charafter, “ He was 
“ greatly refpefted, and generally lamented.
All the clergy commemorate his fweet condefcenfions, bis 
“ free communications, faithful counfels, exemplary tensperance, chearful hofpitality, and bountiful 
charity ’ ; fuch is this epiftolary panegyric ; and which is only equalled by his monumental inferip-

In the early part of life, in the univerfity 
he had the degree of mafter of arts and held a fcllowfhip.
Pie was a well reputed tutor, and had many 
eminent pupils.
Whilft the king was refrdent at Oxford, he was appointed preacher at Chrlft-church ; 
and at St. Mary’s, he preached before the Parliament.
In the fucceeding cenfufions in church and 
ftate, he retired to the north and lived in great privacy.
On the reftoration he was created bachelor 
of divinity, and foon after, by diploma, had a doAor’s degree given him by the univerfity of Oxford.
He was one of thofe who were forflrnate enough to be in the fovereign’s remembrance, for (multitudes 
were ncglefted) and was made one of his chaplains in ordinary ; in November, 1660, he was nominated 
to a prebend in this church.
A prebend in the cathedral of Durham, in a few months, was offered to 
him by bifhop Cofins, and there he had conceived his preferments in the church were to reft ; for at a

tliat it would be the place of his refidence for life.

In the year 1702, he was coiifecrated, at Lambeth, bifhop of this fee; a promotion 
fatd to be obtained by the interell of the Mufgravcs of Edenhall ; an affertion injurious to his great 
learning, his high merit, and connedlions in life, from whence his promotion was^ derived.
He found fome difficulties from the imperfeftion of the inftruments, in granting inftitution to doftor 
Francis Atterbury, to the deanry of Carlifle; which by the queen’s fpecial command were obviated : 
but It is probable this imbittered their minds againfl; each other, for on the bifhop’s interpofition as vi{ito»

and the chapter; at the dean’s inlltgation, dodlor Todd proteflied againft his right of vifitation, infilling

CARLISLE.
EPICOPUS L.
Charles T.yttleton, of Hagley in Worcefternilre, third fon of Sir Thomas Lyttleton.
He had 
his firft rudiments at Eton, and completed his ftudies at Univerlity College, Oxford.
He was intended 
'for the bar, and accordingly was entered in the temple, and took the gown; but either the excellent vir- 
tues mentioned by his panegyrifts, proved fo incompatible with that profeffion ; or on account of a real 
lendernefs of conftitution, which could not endure the heavy and laborious applications of mind which it 
required, he was obliged to quit the law : he returned to Oxford and entered into holy orders.
He had 
the reftory of Alve church, Worcefterlhire, in 1742.
He was one ot the chaplains in ordinary to King 
George II.
and in the year 1748, he was made dean of Exeter.
He enioyed this bilhoprick but fis 
years, dying A.
D. 1768, at his houfe in London.
— He was interred at Hagley.[| 
EPISCOPUS LL 
Edmund Law, D.
D. fucceeded to the fee in 1 768.
— He was born in the parlfh of Cartmel in Lanca- 
fhire,' in the year 1 703.
His father, who was a clergy'man, held a fmall chapel in that neighbourhood ; but 
the family had been fituated at Afleham, in the county of Weftmorland.
He was educated for fome time 
at Cartmel fchool, afterwards at the free grammar-fehool at Kendal ; from which he went, very well ia- 
ftrufted in the learning of grammar fchoois, to St. John’s College in Cambridge.
Soon aftir taking his firft degree, he waseledfed fellow of Chrift‘s College inthatuniveifity.
During 
his refidence In which college, he became known to the public by a tranflatlon of Arclibifhop King’s 
Eflay upon the Origin of Evil, with copious notes; in which many metaphyfical fubjcAs, curious and 
interelling in their own nature, are treated of with great ingenuity, learning, and novelty.
To this work 
was prefixed, under the name of a Preliminary Diflertation, a very valuable piece, written by the Rev, 
Mr. Gay of Sidney College, Our blfiiop always fpoke of this gentleman in terms of the greateft refpedl.
In the Bible, and in the writings of Mr. Locke, no man, he ufed to fay, was fo well verfed.
He alfo, vvhilft at Chrift-Collcge, undertook and went through a very laborious part, in preparing for 
the prefs, an edition of Stephen’s Thefaunis.
His acquaintance, during his firft refidence in the umver- 
fity, was principally with Dr. Wateiland, the learned raafter of Magdalen College ; Dr. Jortin, a name 
kndwn to every fcholar ; and Dr. Taylor, the editor of Demofthenes.
In the year 1737, he was prefented by the univerfity to the living of Grayftock, in the county of 
Cumberland, a redtory of about 300I.
a- year.
Tire advowfon of this benefice belonged to the family of 
Howards of Grayftock, but devolved to the univerfity .for this turn, by virtue of an adl of parliament, 
which transfers to thefe two bodies the nomination to fuch benefices as appertain, at the time of the 
vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic.
The right, however, of the univerfity was contefted ; 
and it was not till after a law-fult of two years continuance, that Mr. Law was fettled in his living.
Soon after this, he married Mary, the daughter of John Chrlftian, Efq. of Unerigg, In the county of 
Cumberland ; a lady, whofe charadler Is remembered with tendernefs and efteem by all who knew her.
In 1743 ’ "'33 promoted by Sir George Fleming, biftiop of Carlifle, to the archdeaconry of that 
^locefe ; and in 1 746, went from Grayftock to refide at Salkeld, a plcafant village upon the banks of the 
river Eden, the rectory of winch is annexed to the archdeaconry.
Mr. Law was not one of thofe w'ho lofe 
and forget themfelves in the country.
During his refidence at Salkeld, he publlftied Confiderations on the 
theory of Religion : J:o which were fuhjolned, Reflediions on the I.ife and CharaAer of Chrift ; and 
an appendix concerning the ufe of the words Soul and Spirit in holy Scripture, and the ftate of the dead 
there deferibed.
Dr. Keene held at this time, with the biftioprick of Cheftcr, the mafterftiip of Peterhoufe In Cambridge.
Defiring to leave the univerfity, he procured Dr. Law to be elected to fucceed him in that ftatlon.
This 
took place in the year 1756 ; In wlilch year Dr. Law refigned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr. Eyre, 
a brother-in-law of Dr. Keene.
Two years before this, he had proceeded to his degree of doftor in 
divinity ; In his public exercife for which, he defended the doftrine of what is ufually called the “ fleep 
of the foul.” 
About the year 1760, he was appointed head librarian of the univerfity; a fituation which, as It pro- 
cured an eafy and quick accefs to books, was peculiarly agreeable to his tafte and habits.
Some time 
Ij An excellent charadter is given of this prelate by Dr. Mills, dean of Exeter, in his addrefs to the focicty of anti* 
•^uaries, on his Xucceedieg him as jirefidcnt, 
after 
CARLISLE.
637 
after this, lie was alfo appointed cafuifiical profefior.
In the year 1762, he fuffered an irreparable lofs 
by the death of his wife ; a lofs in ilfelf every way affliding, and rendered more fo by the iituation of 
Lis family, which then confiiled o' eleven children, many of them very young.
Some years afterwards, 
Le rece ved fcveval preferments, which were rather honourable expreffions of regard from his friends, than 
of much advantage to his fortune.
By Dr. Cornwallis, then biihop of Litchfield, afterwards archbifnop of Canterbury, who had been his 
pupil at Chrill College, he was app )inted to tlie archdeaconry of StafFordfliire, and to a prebend in the 
church of Litchfield.
By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, bifhop of l.incoln, he was made a prebendary 
of that church..
But in the year 1767, by the intervention of the duke of Newcaftle, to whofe interelf, 
in the memorable contell for the high ilewardlhip of the univerfity, he had adhered in oppofition to fomc 
temptations, he obtained a ftall in the church of Durham.
The year after this, the duke of Graftou, 
who had a fhort time before been eletfted chancellor of the univerfity, recommended the mafter of Peter- 
houfe to his majefty for the bifhoprick of Cailifle.
This I'ecommendatlon was made, not only without 
folicitation on his part or that of his friends, but without his knowledge, until tlie duke’s intention in 
his favour was fignliicd to him by the aichbilhop.
In or about the year 1777, ourbiiliop gave to the public a handfome edition.
In three volumes quarto, 
of the Works of Mr. I.ocke, with a Life of the Author, and a preface.
Mr. Locke’s writings and cha- 
raclei he held in the highefc ellcem, and feems to have drawn from them many of his own principles : 
he was a dlfciple of that fchool.
About the fame time he publlfiied a traft, which engaged fome atten- 
tion in the controverfy concerning fubfcriptlon ; and he publiflied new editions of his two principal works, 
with confiderable additions, and fome'alteraticmsv Befides the works already mentioned, he publilhed, 
in 1734, or 1735, a very ingenious Inquhy into the Ideas of Space, Time, SiC.
in which he combats the 
opinions of Dr. Claike and his adherents on thefe fubjefts.
Dr. Law held the fee of Carlifie almoft nineteen years ; during which time he twice, only, omitted 
fpending the fnmmer months in his diocefe at the bilhop’s refidence at Rofe Caftle ; a fituation with which 
he was much pleafed, not only on account of the natural beauty of the place, but becaufe it reftored him 
to the country, in which he had fpent the heft pait of his life.
In the year 1787, he paid this vifit In a 
ftate of great weaknefs and exhauftion ; and died at Rofe about a month after his arrival there, on the 
14th day of Auguft, and in the 84th year of his age.
The life of Dr. Law was a life of inceffant reading and thought, almoft entirely direifted to meta- 
phyfical and religious inquires ; but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally diftin- 
guifhed, is “ that Jefiis (Thrift, at his fecond coming, will, by an aft of his power, reftore to life and 
confijioufnefs the dead of the human fpecies, who, by their own nature, and without this interpofition, 
would remain in the ftate of infenfihility, to which the death brought upon mankind by the fin of Adam 
had reduced them.” He interpreted literally that faying of St. Paul, i Cor. xv.
21.
“ As by man came 
“ death, by man came alfo the refurreftion of the dead.” This opinion had no other effeft upon his 
own nriind than to increafe his reverence for Chrifliaulty, and for its divine Founder.
He retained it, 
as he did his other fpeculative opinions, without laying, as many are wont to do, an extravagant ftrefs 
upon their importance, and without pretending to more certainty than the fubjeft allowed of.
No man 
formed his own conclufions with more freedom, or treated thofe of others with greater candour and 
equity.
He never quarrelled with any perfon for differing from him, or confidered that difference as a 
fufficlent reafon for queftioning any man’s finceiity, or judging meanly of his underftanding.
He was 
zealoufly attached to religious liberty, becaufe he thought that it leads to truth ; yet from his heart 
he loved peace.
But he did not perceive any repugnancy in thefe two things.
There was nothing in 
Lis elevation to his bifhoprick which he fpoke of with more pleafure, than its being a proof that decent 
freedom of inquiry was not difeouraged.
He was a man of great foftnefs of manners, and of the mlldeft and moft tranquil difpofitlon.
His 
voice was never raifed above its ordinary pitch.
His countenance feemed never to have been ruffled ; it 
preferved the fame kind and compofed afpeft, truly indicating the calmnefs and benignity of his temper.
He had an utter diflike of large and mixed companies.
Next to his books his chief fatisfaftlon was in 
the ferious converfation of a literary companion, or in the company of a few friends.
In this fort of 
fociety he would open his mind with great unrefervednefs, and with a peculiar turn and fprightlinefs of 
exprellion.
His perfon was low, but well formed ; his complexion fair and delicate.
Except occafional 
interruptions by the gout, he had for the greateft part of his life enjoyed good health ; and when not 
confined by that diftemper, ivas full of motion and aftivity.
About nine years before his death, he was 
greatly 
CARLISLE.
«38 
greatly enfeebled by a fevere attack of the gout in his ftomach ; and a fhort time after that, loft the ufd 
»f one of his legs.
Notwithftanding his fondnefs for exercife, he rcfigned himfelf to this change, not 
only without complaint, but without any fenfible diminution ot his chearfulnefs and good humour.
His 
fault (for we are not writing a panegyric) was the general fault of retired and ftudious charadlers, too 
great a degree of inadtion and facility in his public ftation.
The modefty, or rather bafhi'ulnefs of hi* 
nature, together with an extreme unwillingnefs to give pain, rendered him fometimes lefs firm and efficient 
in the adminiftratlon of authority than was requifite.
But it is the condition of human mortality.
There 
is an oppofitlon between fome virtues which fcldom permits them to fubfift together in perfedlion * 
The biffiop was interred with due folemnity in his cathedral church, in which a handlbme monument, 
is eredled to his memory, bearing the following infeription ; —

The city of Carlille is divided into two parifhes.
The parifli of St. Mary’s, or 
which the cathedral is the parochial church ;* the city and principal parts of both 
parifhes are within that liberty, which is known by the name of the manor of 
ihe foccage of CarliOe. In the notes is the boundaries.
The parifh of St. Cuthbert’s is the other divifion of this city.
The church 
becoming 
• It comprehends Scotch- ftrect, Fifher-ftreet, Caftle-ftreet, .and Abbey-ftrect, within the city ; Cal- 
dewgate, Cumbeifdale, Richardgate, Newtown, and Newby without, 
J By virtue of a commifiion ifiued from the court of exchequer, j6to; the boundaries were thus 
certified by the cemmiffioners.
Beginning at the fouth fide of the river Eden over againft Etterby, and

He was bleft with fo fweet and

This benign difpofiiion made him the conftant advocate of the

of the human fpecles, in oppofillon to tyranny and oppreffion; thefe he maintain-

“ redory of Wigton to the Abbey Elolme, for the civil law ; and Wigton itfelf to 
“ the Lord Anthony Lucy, for his help in the country, becaufe her mother, Idyo-

But Margaret de Wigton re-

Therefore Blackhill fell to Sir Robert Parving, who married

This city had many royal grants, and great privileges : the firfl: chat is pointed 
out, is that of King Henry II.
which was burnt by the devaflations made by the 
Scots, and is recited and confirmed by the charter of King Henry 111 .
It dorii 
not appear when the firfi incorporation of the burgefies took place, or what was 
the original confiitution.
In the charter of King Henry III.
we have thefe words, 
Et quod fimiliter habent Gildain mercatoriam liberam, ita quod nihil inde re- 
** fpondeant aliquibus ; etc.
Nos omnes libertates illaset confuetudinos praefatis 
civibus noftris concedimus et hac carta nofira confirmanus pro nobiset hseredi- 
bus noftris ; volentes, quod omnibus praeditfiiis libertatibus et confuetudinibus 
de caetera gaudeant et utantur, libere, quiete, bene cc in pace ; et integre, in per- 
petuum, cum omnibus aliis libertatibus et liberis confuetudinibus ad praedidam 
villam Carlioli pertinentibus.” 
. By this charter the citizens were exempted from the payment of toll, paflage, 
pontage, and all culloms belonging to the king; with the piivilege of having 
wood for fuel, and for their eredions within the foreft of Carlille.
Great part of the city having again futfered by accidental fire, the records were 
a fecond time deftroyed.
King Edward I.
in the 2 1 ft year of his reign, by charter, 
dated the 23d day of June, recites the grant of King Henry III.
from the inroll- 
ment of it in his chancery, and dating that it had been loft by fire, confirmed it 
verbatim.
In confequence of his Scotch expeditions, he refided frequently at 
Carliflc, and feems to have entertained a particular regard for the place, by his 
honouring the city with theaftembly of his parliament in the 35th year of hia 
reign; who made their refidence there, from the 20th day of January to Palm 
Sunday following.
The memorable ads of this parliament give no fmall luftre 
to our annals.
King Edward III.
alfo feems to have entertained a fpecial aftedion and favour 
towards the citizens; and in order to fecure to the burgefies their privileges, he 
caufed an inquifition to be taken, whereon he fhould found his charter of confir- 
mation, which bears date the 7th of February, in the 22d year of his reign of 
England, and 13th of France.
Therein it is recited, that it having been found by 
inquifition taken by his commiftioners, Richard de Denton and John de Harring- 
ton, and returned into his chancery, that the citizens, “ habuerunt et habere con- 
fueverunt a tempore quo non exiftit memoria,” had, and were ufed to have, the 
privileges therein fet forth, for time immemorial, on the petition of the citizens; 
ac etiam cives civitatis prsdida nobis fupplicaverunt, ut fibi didas libertates, 
quietantias, confuetudines et proficua per chartam noftram confirmare vclimus.” 
And in confideration of its being in the frontier of Scotland, and w ell fituated for 
the refuge and deicnce of the inhabitants of the adjacent territories, againft the 
frequent incuifions of the Scots: and al o, in commiferation of the late dreadful 
mortality of the plague, and the frequent devaflations made by the nonhern ene- 
alienate their tenements without licence of the lord, giving notice thereof within 40 days ; paying only a 
penny fine on death or alienation, and to the ftewavd for an alienation, fourpence.; and for furrender and 
copy thereof, 6d ; and inrolment 4d.
and 2d.
to the bailiff upon every defeent or alienation ; and about 
tlie fame time the common was divided and granted in fee to the tenants without any rent referved, the 
lord having 1 50 acres for his lhare in land, which is now called Blackhill Park, and is the inheritance of

By the recitals of this grant it Teems, that preceding it, and even for time im- 
memorial, the city had been governed by a mayor, bailiffs, and coroners ; but 
when this body politic had its commencement, there is no evidence that we have 
jet met with.
King Richard II.
in the 5th year of his reign, granted them a confirmatory 
charter.
In confequence of the fpoil and devadation, made by the armies of Margaret, 
Queen of England, and Henry Duke of Exeter her adherent, the city obtained from 
King Edward IV.
a relaxation of one half of the fee- farm rent of eighty pounds 
yearly, paid to the crown ; and alfo gained a grant of the king’s fiflieries of Car-

Rone, it had endured ail the eafualtics of many ages.
The infeription, faid to be 
cut on the front of this building, has exercB'ed the attention of antiquaries.
Camden’s words are, “On the front of it was this inlcription, Mcirii viHorio’ :

I have heard that fome copies have it, not Marti vicloria^ but Marti "ciclori^.
which latter may probably be favoured by fome, as feeming to come nearer the 
“ truth.” As no veBige remains of this piece of antiquity, we muB reB contented 
with the uncertainty, in which Camden and his editor have left us, relative to it.
Ocher two Roman remains are mentioned by Camden, which he fays he faw

In the Archasologia, is publifhed accounts of done hatchets found at Carlifle, 
with a learned treatife thereon; and to which we refer the curious reader.
If we may prefu.me to offer our feniimenis on thefe fubjcdls, after the learned 
antiquaries have fo elaborately expatiated thereon, without the appearance of 
arrogance and prefumption, we would fuggeft, that the bones mentioned by the 
bifiiop, mixed with the fragments of the patarae, were the remains of facrifice; 
when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out, this has been the general repofitory.
If thefe were the remains of animals [lain in battle, the mixture is not to be 
reconciled; and it was more than fuch occahon would have required to clear them 
from the bones of men flain at the fame time.
The learned inquirer did not dif.
cover any remains of broken trapping, fludings, or ornaments of horfes, or men 
accoutrements.
The hammers, or ftone hatchets, feem very unfit for weapons of 
v/arfare, unweildy, and uncouth : if they had been in ufe in battle, fome tefiimony 
W'ould have been given of them ; and they would not have been totally difufed, 
one might prefume, at the coming of the Romans, but would have been exhibited 
as trophies, or ot.herwife as teftimonies of the valour of Britifh heroes, the aneftors 
of thofe who appeared armed againfl: the invaders, in the moft facred caufe of war, 
the defence of liberty, and their country; and the maintenance of the efiablifhed 
religion.
We have received no account of fuch weapons then in ufe.
As domeftic 
utenfils, it is not probable they would have been fecreted with fuch care, or de- 
pofited with fuch folemnity, as even to fupport the head of the deceafed owner in 
the fepulchrc.
Could we imagine the friends of any perfonage, who was to be 
interred w'ith the funeral pomp of a tumulus, would bufy themfclves with giving 
the decealed labourer his beetle with him, for the regions of death We humbly 
conceive this w as a lacred implement in the pofieflion of the heathen prieft, w'ith 
which he prepared the facrifice : we have innumerable relations, of the abhorrence 
the ancients had, of their facred things and places being polluted by firangers ; 
and thence w'c trace the caufe of thefe flints being concealed.
All degrees of reli- 
gious, in remote ages, took great precaution to bury; with the confecrated minilter, 
the inftruments of his office, and that was follow'ed in the practice of the ancient 
Romifh church.
The facred fecuris of the Britifli prieft, was the firfl emblem of 
his fundlion, and the propereff ornament to be placed w-ith his remains in the 
tomb.
The remnants of Britifli priefts were driven into Scotland by the arms of 
Rome ; there they longefl retained their ancient rites and religion, and there thofe 
inftruments of the ancient priefthood have been moft frequently found.

Carlifle, from its fituation, was continually fubjcdt to the diflrefs of warfare, in 
the feveral irruptions of the Scots ; and frequently was taken from the Englifli.
The border wars were profecuted with a degree of ferocity and favage barbarity^ 
difgraceful to humanity, and horrid in hiflory.
Among the various incidents in the hirtory of Carlifle, the following are the 
moft material.
So foon, after the fortifications were conflrudlcd, as the beginning of the 
reign of King Stephen, David King of Scotland, in the firfl year of his reign, 
entered into England, and took poflclTion of this city.
Stephen, on receiving the 
news, is faid to have exclaimed, “ Quae dolofe cepit vidtoriofe recipiam;” buc 
this weak prince, fo far from performing what he boafled, made a ceflion of the 
whole county to the Scots.
f 
In the year j 138, King David of Scotland, made this city the place of his re- 
treat, after his dreadful overthrow at the battle of the Standard.
And here he re- 
ceived Alberic the pope’s legate, by whofe influence, all the women captives 
were brought to Carlifle and fet at liberty.
He obtained from the Scotch leaders, 
a folemn promife, that in future incurfions, they would fpare the churches, and 
with hold their fwords from the aged, from women and infants: an injundiion 
which humanity dicflated, but which the favage cuftoms of the contending nati- 
ons had not admitted into the modes of warfare.
Henry, eldefl fon of the emprefs Maud, came to David at Carlifle, attended by' 
the great barons of the weftern parts of England, and received the order of knight-

hood with much pomp and ceremony; the young prince then taking an oath, that ' 
on his acceflion to the crown of England, he would confirm to David and his Ton, 
their Englifii pofieffions ; but iuch are the oaths of princes!
Henry no fooner 
grafped the fceptre, than he demanded of the Scotch regency, reftitution of Cum- 
berland : and in 1158, the two monarchs had an interview in this city ; but much 
dilfention arofe, and the claim of the Englifli monarch was not complied with.f 
The Englifii obtained and held quiet poflelfion, till after the accefiion of William 
the Lion, who fucceeded Malcome on the throne of Scotland : he, in the year 1 173, 
made a fruitlefs afiauir upon Carlifie ; but in the enfuing year, returning with an 
army of 80,000 men, he commenced a regular fiege, the city being defended by 
Robert de Vaux ; after laying before it fome time, the Scotch forces formed a 
blockade, to give liberty for withdrawing part of the army, to ravage and wafic 
the adjacent country : the garrifon were reduced to great difirefs for want of pro- 
vifion, and came to a conditional capitulation, that if they did notAeceive fuccours 
from the Englifii before Michaelmas, they would furrender the place; but the 
fucceeding events prevented the capitulation being carried into effetfl, and Wil- 
liams’ being made prifoner at Alnwick, put an end to the difafiers of the war.
The greatefi; part of the city lufi'ered by fire in this reign, and the records and 
charters were deftroyed.§ 
In the reign of King John, Alexander, King of Scotland, entered England, and 
befieging Carlifie, took it : but he could not reduce the cafile, which remained in 
the hands of the Englifii.* 
King Henry III made Robert de Veteripont, governor of this cafile and city.
The city fuft'ered greatly by an accidental fire in the year 1292, in which con- 
flagration, great part of the cathedral was defiroyed, and all the records which the 
city and convent had procured to be renewed, were alfo burnt.
In the chronicle 
of Lanercoft, is a full account of the dreadful devafiations made by this fire.
In 1296, the Scots entered the weflern march, and having laid the country 
wafie as they approached Carlifie, they burnt the fuburbs, and attempted to take 
the city by ftorm ; but the inhabitants made fo brave a defence, even the women 
mounting the walls, difeharging fiones, boiling water, and other things on the 
alTailants, that they abandoned their enterprize, and retreated to their own country.
By an entry in the old regifier book of the abbey, it appears that on the 4th 
June, 32d King Edward 1 .
half the city was burnt down, as far as the gate of 
Richardby.
King Edw'ard L refided here from the 30th of January, in the 35th year of his 
reign, to the 28th of June, when he proceeded on his laft expedition towards 
Scotland, and died in his camp at Brugh on Sands.

In the Qth year of the reign of King Edward II.
Robert Brus, King of Scotland, 
on his incurfion laid waRe the country as far as Allerdale and Coupland in this 
county : he bclieged Carlifle in a regular form, by engines and other warlike 
modes, for ten days, and at length was obliged to withdraw his troops in great 
precipitation, leaving behind them mofl: of their inftruments of war.
They M erc 
hotly puiTued by the Englifli ; and two of the Scottiih leaders, John de Moravia 
and Sir Robert Bardolph, were taken priioners, and afterwards ranfomed.
In the 15th year of King Edward 11 .
Andreu' Harcla, Earl of Carlifle, M’as 
feized in the caftle, and fuffered as a traitor.
This adlion was fo gallant, that it 
appears worth repeating here : the carl was publicly proclaimed a traitor, by 
the king’s command, Anthony, Lord Lucy, was font to apprehend him.
Hav- 
ing difperfed his party in the city to prevent fufpicion.
Lord Lucy, w ith a few 
attendants, entered the caflle, as having bufinefs with the carl : his principal affo- 
ciates in this enterprize, were Sir Hugh de Louther, Sir Richard de Denton, and 
Sir Hugh de Morriceby, with four efquircs in arms: the party, to whom the 
defign was communicated, had fignals appointed to them for their conduct in the 
bufinefs ; and as the knights pafled each gate, a number of men halted, as if care- 
lefsly loitering for want of immediate employment ; but with an intention to 
guard the pafs, prevent efcapes, and to be at hand to lend their aid if occafion re- 
quired.
The four chiefs, with their efquires, pafled into the innermofl, and mofl: 
fecure parts of the caflle, even through the great hall, to the earl’s private apart- 
ment; where, finding him fitting in an unfufpicious manner, Lord Lucy accofled 
him, requiring him to furrender or defend himfelf; a cry of treafon immediately 
echoed through the caftle, and the keeper of the inner gate prepared to fluit it, 
but was inftaritlyflain by Sir Richard Denton.
The watch-w’ord being given, the 
parties formed into bodies, took pofleflion of the gates and avenues, and the carl, 
with the whole garrifon, furrendered w ithout further bloodfhcd.
The chief pri- 
foner was put into fafe durance till the king’s pleafurc relative to him fliould be 
known.
In the eleventh year of King Edward III.
the Scots laid fiege to the city of 
Carlifle, t and burnt the fuburbs with the hofpital of St. Leonards ; but the city 
held out.
. .
, 
Sir William Douglas of Lochmaben was kept in irons m the caftle ; fan uncom- 
mon aft; of feverity towards a prifoner of w'ar) but he was eftcemed fo enterpriz- 
ing and dangerous an enemy by King Edward III.
that this was done at his fpecial 
command.
in the vear 1345, Penrith and Carlifle were burnt by the Scots, under the com- 
mand of Sir William Douglas.
A body of the Scotch forces, headed by Sir 
Alexander Strachan, detached for foraging, were intercepted; and Sir Alc.xandcr 
was (lain by Sir Robert Ogle, who ran him through the body with his lance.
Bi/hop 
Kirby, the eleventh bifliop of this diocefe, fignalized himfelf in this rencounter; 
for bein'rdifmounccd, and in imminent danger of being made a prifoner; he fought 
with uncommon bravery, recovered his horfc, and by his valour and animating 
exhortations, he fpirited up his party, rallied them frequently, and brought them 
again to tlie fight, to which the vift:ory was defervcdly attributed.

In the fixth year of the reign of King Richard 11 .
the Scots fent forth a plun- 
dering band, who ravaged the forefl: of Inglewood, fackcd Penrith at the time of 
the fair, and returned w^ith a vaft booty; having gained, as Hollingfliead fays, a 
drove of 40,000 head of cattle.
In the 29th year of King Henry VIII’s reign, during Afkc’s rebellion, Carlifle 
was befieged by 8000 men, under the command of Mufgrave and Tilby, partizans 
in that affair, but they were repulfcd by the garrifon ; and as they were retiring, 
were intercepted by the Duke of Norfolk and his troops, who took all the leaders 
prifoners, except Mufgrave ; thofe, with about feventy others, he ordered to im- 
mediate execution, and hung them on the city walls.
In the 40th and 41 fl: years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, this place fuffered a 
dreadful vifitation by the plague, in which their died 1196 perfons, being com- 
puted to be one third of the whole inhabitants.
It alfo raged in the adjacent 
country with a great mortality, as was mentioned when w’e fpoke of Salkeld and 
Penrith : for the relief of the difeafed poor, contributions w'ere railed for the city, 
to the amount of 209I.

In the twentieth year of the reign of King Charles I.
A. D.
1644, this place was 
furrendered to the parliament forces commanded by Lefley, having fuftained a 
fiege and blockade from the 9th of Odtober to June following ; during which, the 
difirefs of the garrifon and inhabitants was fo great, that the fiefh of horles, dogs, 
and rats were eaten.
Bread w'as fo totally exhaufled, that hemp-feed was fubfti- 
tuted, fo long as any was found in the place.
Great afliffance was given by the 
country, when provifions could be thrown in, to the amount in value of 463I.
los.
procured by private fubferiptions.
On furrender, honourable terms of capitula- 
tion were obtained, both for the military wdth honours of war, as alfo for the in- 
habitants their liberties and properties.
A coinage of filver pieces of three fhillings value took place in the caflle during 
the fiege, from the plate of the inhabitants, fent in for that purpofe.
They are 
become very fcarce, and bear a confiderabie price with the curious.
The laft hoftile adls, of which Carlifle M’as the feene, w ere thofe in the Scotch 
rebellion, 1745.
R furrendered to the chevalier on the 14th of November, who 
lay before it with his whole army.
The gazette account of this event, faid that 
for feven days before, neither the officers nor the common men of the garrifon 
got fcarce an hour’s reft, being perpetually under alarms; that many were fo 
iick through their great fatigue, that being out of all hopes of fpeedy relief, they 
abfolutely refufed to hold out any longer, and multitudes went oh every hour over 
the walls ; fome of whom fell into the hands of the rebels, till the officers of feveral 
companies were at lad left with three or four men ; fo that the mayor and corpo- 
ration determined to hang out a white flag (though contrary to the opinion and 
proteflation of Colonel Durand) and made the beft terms they could get for them- 
lelves : that the colonel was thereupon obliged to abandon the caflle, not having 
above feventy invalids in his whole corps, and mofl of them unfit for fervice; the 
rebels threatening, in cafe of refufal, to fack and deflroy the whole town with fire 
and fword.”t The town raifed 2000I.
to fave the houfes from being plundered.

His Royal Highnefs, the late Duke of Cumberland, was in perfon before Car- 
liflc in the month of December following, and planned the attack.
On the 27th 
of that month his troops opened a battery of fix eighteen pounders, againfl the four 
gun battery of the caflle, his Highnefs putting the match to the firfl gun ; and 
here he narrowly efcaped a cannon fliot from the enemy, falling within a yard of 
him.
On the 29th the rebels difplaytd a flag of iruce.
and on the thirtieth they 
accepted the concife terms offered them by his Highnefs.
“ All the terms his 
Royal Highnefs will, or can grant to the rebel garrifon of Carlifle, are, that they 
fhall not be put to the fword, but be referved for the king’s pleafure.” Of the 
Manchefter regiment that furrendered prifoners,therewere one colonel,five captains, 
fix lieutenants, feven enfigns, one adjutant, and ninety-three non-commiflioned 
officers, drummers and private men.
Of the Scorch, the governor, one fuigeon, 
fix captains, feven lieutenants, and three enfigns, with 256 non-commiffioned offi- 
cers, drummers and private men.
Of thofe who faid they were in the French 
fervice, three officers, one ferjeant, and four private men.
There was one extra- 
ordinary prifoner, the Rev. James Cappock, a Lancafhire man, made bilhop of 
Carlifle, by the chevalier, on his firfl: entry ,;jl 
The tillage land here bears good crops of wheat, rye, barley, and oats.
The mea- 
dows are rich, fome lands letting from 4I.
to 5I.
an acre, and upwards.
The fheep 
and cattle are much fuperior to the more hilly parts ; as a fpirit of improving the 
breed, and obtaining better fleeced fheep is appearing, to the great improvement: 
of the country.
The chief manufadory of Carlifle, is in printed cottons, of which 
there are four very large works, carried to high excellence and perfection, which 
bring yearly 24,000!.
in duties to the crown; fupportinga vaft multitude of in- 
duflrious people, of all ages and fexes ; much of the pencil work being executed 
by girls.
It is a fight the traveller fhould not omit, and the generofity of the 
proprietors is fingular, for they give permiffion to fhew every branch of the ma- 
nufadory, from the fhop w here the block-cutters carve the pattern, to the dreffing 
houfe and calender.- There are feveral manufadorics of checks, calicoes, muflins, 
and fancy goods : alfo, an extenfive cotton-fpinning manufadory,* a foap boilery, 
feveral tallow-chandlers, tanners, fkinners, and curriers.
Carlifle is likewife noted 
for making hats, whips, and fifli-hooks .

The market of Carlifle is fupplied abundantly; the mutton and beef are of 
excellent flavour ; wild-fowl abounds, and there is a profufion and variety of 
fifh expofed here to fale, not to be excelled in any market in Britain: the falmon 
and trout are incomparable ; the river fifh, and thofe of the lakes, are peculiar and 
abundant.
In a few words, the man of epicu.»-ean appetite, who would ftudy 
the indulgence of his palate, may find in this market a variety of dainties, not 
to be fo generally enjoyed in any other part of England.

The 
CARLISLE 
THE MODERN STATE OF THE CITY OF CARLI 3 LE 4 
The city of Carlifle (the origin of which is loil in the uncertainties of antiquity) (lands upon a 
pleafing eminence, which having every way a gradual defcent, the town is eafily kept clean, without the 
aid of a common (hore.
Being a frontlet town towards Scotland, it is fortified with a wall and citadel 
now in ruins, and a caftle kept ilill in fome fort of repair.
Whllft South and North Britain had each 
their refpedlive king, and the Inhabitants of the two kingdoms lived In habits of enmity with each 
other, Carlillc, expofed to the calamities of war, was often lacked, and its citizens plundered and 
murdered.
Difmal times to live In !
The acceffion of the Stuart Emily to the crown of England 
fomevvhat abated national animofities and miferles : and the union, by conferring reciprocal privileges, 
and opening a free intercourfe between the two countries, has obliterated invidious difiinftlons, and con« 
vinced the people on both fides the Tweed, that their vicinity to each other (hould have induced their 
anceftors, alwavs to cultivate habits of amity and friendftilp with their neighbours.
From the wall, which may be afcended In different parts by flights of fleps, the eye Is entertained 
with a beautiful and cxtenlive landLape, and Imperceptibly led into fevcial diftant counties, whllft 
Scotland and Solway •Fiith’^ do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting feene.
The city is 
fut rounded with three rivers.
Fetter il on the fouth, Eden on the eaft and north, and Caude on the weft, 
whofe meandering dreams are feen in many places at a great diftance.
— A garrifon was formerly kept 
Jiere ; but there has been none for the laft thirty years.
The military who may be ftalloncd in the 
town for a time, are quartered upon the public houfes in the city and fuburbs.
Carlifle has ftdl a go- 
vernor and deputy governor, whofe places are only fine cures, A town major, engineer, barrack mailer, 
ilore-keeper, head-gunner, three quarter-gunners, &c.
When the governor of this city happened to be 
one of its reprefentatives in parliament, the fubordinate places in the garrifon were given to freemen, 
(but generally to fuch as were In the corporation) fo that frequently the chief magifrate was a quarter- 
gunner at the fame time.
Thus was the invalid, worn out In the fervice of his king and country, too 
frequently overlooked in the difpofition of this appointment.
Carlifle being a bilhop’s fee, has a cathedral, in which are performed the cathedral fervice ; in tlic 
fame edifice Is performed the par-'chlal fervice of St. Mary’s: and in a part of it the chancellor of the 
diocefe holds the confiftory court.
As this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city, a (hort 
defeription of it may, perhaps, not be deemed improper.
The choir of this venerable pile Is the moft magnificent part of the building.
It has a (lately 
lleeple, with a ring of eight bells, the roof is covered with lead, and being confiderably higher than 
the other buildings in the city, has a very fine eftedl when viewed as a diftant objedl.
This noble edi- 
fice being partly of Gothic and partly of Saxon architeflure, offers what is worthy the infpedlion of the 
architedl and antiquarian.
Contiguous to the cathedral is an extenfive church-yard, (the principal bury- 
ing ground) furrounded with a wall feven feet high, in the infidc of which is a row of lofty plane trees, 
whofe branches overhang a part of the adjacent ftreet and form a (hade, under which is a fine paved 
walk much reforted to.
Within the preclncls of the abbey, befides the cathedral, there are feveral ve- 
nerable buildings, which (except the prebends’ houfes) fnew marks of antiquity.
St. Cuthbert’s, the other parilh church In Carlifle, is a modern edifice, rebuilt in the year 1778, upon 
the fite of the old church, but without any kind of external or internal ornament.
It has a fquare 
fteeple or tower, but fo c nfined as not to admit of a ring of bells ; fo that the pariiliioners are called 
tor^ether to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell, which was not exchanged for one of a 
louder tone.
The fteeple Is decorated with a dome covered with lead j from which a fane projefts, hav- 
the year in which the church was rebuilt cut in it.
Befides thefe two churches, there are in Carlifle, three Proteftant dKTentiug mceting-houfes, || one 
Quaker, and one Methodift meeting-houfe ; Wefley’s connedlion.
The public buildings are, the Town-hall, Moot hall, and Council-chamber, confpicuoufly fituated In 
the centre of the city ; and to which you afeend by a flight of broad fteps from the promenade.
Above 
the entrance are placed the arms of the corporation.
Here are held the criminal and NIfi Prius courts

The records and writings belonging to the corporation, the freemen’s

are kept in detached offices belonging to the fame building.|| The council-chamber is 
orn.imciited with a cupola and clock.
The Guild-hall, in which the free trades hold their meetings, i&

Itrufiure ^ The Maiket-crofs (lands at the foulh end of the promenade, and oppofite to the town-hall.
It feems to be a modem edifice, has a neat appearance, but without any cover ; it has the corporation 
arms cut upon it ; underneath which was fculptured, but of late years defaced, a lion with Its paw upon 
a large folio, alluding either to magna charta or the city charter.
The guard-houfe, contiguous to the 
butcher-market, is a very great nuifance, and hurts the view of the principal flreets ; and what renders 
it Hill more fo is, the corporation hare granted leafes, and built houfes adjoining to it, perhaps, upon the 
royal property.
Near the Engliflr-gate are charity houfes, built by the corporation, in which decayed, 
freemen, or the widows of thofe deceafed, arc allowed to live gratis.
In Carlifle there Is one endowed 
fcliooL* There is alfo a charity fchool for cloathing and educating the daughters of poor freemen.
f 
The corporation of this city confifts of a recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common council- 
men.^ One of the aldermen is annually chofen mayor, and the other annual place-men are chofen out 
of the common council.
The fubordinate officers are three ferjeants at mace, five bedals, or town fca- 
vengers.
The ferjeants and bedals wear the corporation livery, and their places are generally for life.
The ferjeants aft as bailiffs in proceffes before the mayor’s court, and to them is committed the execution 
of fummons and writs of arteft for debt iffued by It. The office of the bedals is to keep the flreets clean, 
and to put in execution the punlfliment awarded to offenders within the mayor’s jurildlftlon.
The 
liberties of the corporation extend a few yards without the city walls, and are afeertained by what Is 
called the Freelidge flone, with their arms fculptured upon it.
It may alfo be proper to obferve, that 
the public and private buildings belonging to the body corporate, have the name of the mayor by whom,, 
and the year in which each edifice w'as ereded, fculptured on fome confpicuous part, fo that the traveller’s 
eye often catches thefe words, “ EreSed by Efq. Mayor,’' even upon a mean edifice.
Carlifle, about the beginning of the prefent century, exhibited no marks of modern convenience and 
elegance.
The buildings, moflly of wood, clay, and laths, befpoke the poverty and bad tafle of the in- 
habitants.
The gabels fronted the flreets, the doors were generally in the centre, and many of the houfes 
had porches which projeded two or three yards into the flreet, doubilcfs for 'warmnefs.
The front door 
was arched, or Gothic, formed to conefpond with the gabel; and the diminutive windows, which gave 
light to the inner apartments, were very improperly placed, but of the fame order.
^ The doors were of 
oak, very flrong and clumfy, put together with large wood pins, a part of which projeded an inch or 
two from the door.
Thefe pins were many In number, and fometimes placed in figures romanticly 
irregular.
Houfes were not then painted either within or without ; this being only a modern improve- 
ment.
Tile flreets, though fpaclous, were paved with large flones, and the centre part or caufeway, rofe 
to a confiderable height.
The fronts from the houfes were paved in the fame manner, the confequence 
of which was, that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches, and flone bridges were placed in many 
different parts, for the convenience of paffing from one fide of the flreet to the other.
’Iffiefe ^utters 
were the refervoirs of all kinds of filth, which when a fudden heavy rain happened, by flopping the 
conduit of the bridges, inundated the flreets fo, as to render them impaffable on foot.
The fliambles, w’hich flood in the market place, were private property, and being built entirely of 
wood and covered with different kinds of Ante, gave them a very grotefqac and antique appearance.
At 
the north end of the fh’ambles was a w-ell, over which was a building placed upon pillars, called Carnaby’s 
H It is to be lamented that the houfes under the Moot- hall arc the private property of different perfons : to pnrehafe 
thefe would require a deal of money.
The funds of the corporation are not competent for this ; therefore, there are 
little hopes of ever feeing this edifice become an ornament to the city, by being rebuilt upon a more ufeful and elegant 
plan.

CARLISLE.
Folly.
On the front of each fide of this building was the filh market : the Folly and the fhambles have 
been lately taken down, the latter having been purchafed, at a great price, by the corporation.
The former 
was their own property.
For this the corporation deferve the thanks of the inhabitants of Carlifle, as the 
fliambles, by occupying a great part of one of the principal ftreets of the city, were a public nuii'ance.
Tittle more than half a century ago, the inhabitants of Carlifle carried on no foreign commerce.— 
Their trade confifted in that of a good weekly market, two annual fairs, and two extraordinary well at- 
tended ftatutes, for hiring fervants.
The annual fairs in this city, formerly drew together numbers of 
people from many parts of England and Scotland.
The bufinefs for the whole year was fettled at thefe 
meetings ; as in many places the intercourfe between town and town, or man and man, was not yet car- 
ried on by way of port carriers, and other public conveyances.
The affize and public diveriions con- 
tributed greatly to draw together the neighbouring gentry.
Though there was very little trade and 
commerce in this city, yet the inhabitants did not feem to know the want of it.
The neceffaries of life 
were uncommonly cheap, and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own fpinning.— 
Pride and luxury in eating, drinking, furniture and drefs, had not yet made their entrance within the 
city walls ; induftry and hofpitality were the prominent features of the people.
The vidluallers brewed 
their own ale, of a good quality, and fold it for threepence a quart, full meafure.
And (luch was the 
cuftom of the place) feidonr did a company call for the fecond pot, without the landlord or landlady 
prefenting them with the fare of the houfc to reliflr their liquor.
.Spiritnous liquors were very feldom 
made ufe of : though the inhabitants were not opfllent, yet many of them had confiderable property, 
and for the moft part under a good tenure.
* * * § 
The town at the time we are fpeaking of, was not very populous, and therefore the office of mayor, 
or chief magiftrate, was confidercd to be of great confequcnce.
He feldom appeared in public without 
the rod of jullic'e, and had always one of the ferjeants to attend him.
The baleful feeds of party were 
not then Town among the inhabitants, a friendly and neighbourly intercourfe pervaded the whole city.
All the ancient cuftoms were kept up with harmony and feftivity, and man united to man by love and 
good fellowlhip, circumftanced as the inhabitants were, living in the centre of a rich and well cultivated 
country, it is no wonder if their minds were free.
In ages prior to this asra, they had been expofed to 
one continued feene of waifare.
Under this hazardous fituation, it may reafonably be fuppofed that, 
their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the myllerics and fluAuatlons attendant upon a 
trading intercourfe.
And fuppofe they had been in affluent circumftances, it cannot be imagined they 
would have expended their money in building.
Having been fo long accuftomed to the calamities inci- 
dent to war, they wiflied for nothing more than to enjoy that tranquility, they and their anceflors had 
been fo long ftrangers to.
This city continued in the fituation above-mentioned, without any material alteration either in refpeA 
to trade or improvement in building, till the rebellion In 1745.
Soon after this period, a company of 
Hamburgh merchants fixed upen Carlifle as a proper place to carry on an extenfive woolen manufa&ory.y 
The diftance from Lincolnflfire, Yorkflilre, Scotland, and thofe parts of the two kingdoms entiched 
with the ftaple commodity, was a very inconfiderable objeft to this company of adventurers.
To faci- 
litate this undertaking, two gentlemen (brothers) of the name of Dcvvlichcr, were fent over from the 
continent to fuperintend the work.
This manufaftory was of great Importance to the Inhabitants of 
Carlifle and the country around.
It brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen 
in the diftrent branches of the woolen trade.
People, to the diftance of twenty miles from the city 
were employed, and every loom that could be got was engaged.
The moft fanguine hopes were enter- 
tained, that the undertaking would anfwer the end propofed : and never were two men engaged In any 
bufinefs more carrefled by alt ranks of people, than the Dewllchers were.
A few years after this manu- 
faftorj" was eftablifhed, the elder brother died, who had taken the moft aflive part of the bufinefs upon 
himfelf ; and who, from its flourifhing ftate during his life, feemed to be cvety way competent to fo great 
a truft The younger brother had, fometime prior to the death of the elder, made a very imprudent con- 
ne 61 iori by inariiage with the houfc keeper to the family-^ This woman was weak and ambitious, and by 
• The principal part of the houfes in Carlifle are freehold ; a fev/ are leafcLold under the dean and chapter, and the 
corporation ; ancj a few under the king.
II This manufadlory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths.
All the different branches of 
the bufinefs, from the Iheep {hearing to the fmifhing the pieces, were performed.
And as moft of the woik was done

her was the ruin of this once flourKViIng manufaAory brought about.
Having the afcendancy over her 
credulous hufband, (lie perfuaded him to difmifs mod of the old w'orkmen, who were ovcrfcers, from their 
employment : thele men having been bred to the bulinefs, were capable of conducing the different bran, 
chos of it.
In their places, the relations and acquaintances of the new midrefs were fubdituted, people 
that knew nothing of the matter.
Things foon began to wear a different afpeft ; the workmen were 
much didatisfied with their new maders ; quarrels and complaints daily increafed, and a very little time 
put a finidiing hand to the whole undertaking : for, by mifmanagement on the part of the new foremen, 
and by the negligence and extravagance of the fupenntendant and his wife, the company was declarer 
infolvent : and as no perfon or company would come forward as fuccedbrs, Carhfle, in a very little time, 
was reduced to the date it was in at the commencement of this manufadfory.-j- The failure of this com- 
pany was fevcrely felt by many in Carlifle and the neighbourhood ; for, as nothing was carried forwaid as 
a fubditutc to employ the indudrious poor, thofe who had been employed In the work were driven to 
travel with their families to different parts to feek for employment ; and for many months nothing but 
did refs appeared around Carlifle for feveral miles.* 
During the period we are fpeaking of, provifions of all kinds were very cheap, :J: and mod of the peo- 
ple’s apparel continued to be of their own fpinning.
Very little improvement had taken place in build- 
ing, and the dreets continued in the fame fituatloa.
Manure was at this time of fo little value, that the 
corporation gave a man forty fhillings a-year, and a new cart occafionally, to take it away once a-week.
All the goods which came to this place from Newcadle, were conveyed chiefly upon pack-hoifes; the 
roads were impaffable the greated part of the feafon for any other conveyance.
No public works were 
carried on, except a Imall mannfaftory for linen by an Alderman Cook, and a whip manufadlory.
under 
the firm of Brown and company vvhich employed a few paupers.
Whips and fiflr-hooks were the two 
chief ar ides in trade Carlifle was noted for.|| Great quantities of coarfe linen yarn were weekly expofed 
in this market for fale.
clticfly from the borders and Scotland, where the people grew their own flax, and 
fpun it.
This yarn was princioally purchafed by country weavers, or by people commiffioned to buy and 
fend it to manufaduring towns.
^ 
Little increafe in population had hitherto taken place.
A few foot foldiers and artillery men kept 
garrifon, and thefe were quartered chiefly upon the public.
Carlifle, at this time, kept up the appearance 
of a formidable place : centrles were datloned at every gate, at the commanding-officer’s houfe, the caftle, 
&c.
and the gates were flint, and locrked every night with much military parade ; morning and evening 
guns were fired as a llgnal when to open and flint the garrifon gates, and pieces of ordnance were placed 
upon the turrets, fituated in different parts of the fortification.
The publicans fflll continued to brew their own ale, and mod of them made their own malt.^ It had 
been a cullom for many years backward, for the corporation to demand multure, by compelling the 
Tiduallets to grind the malt at their mills.
This began to be felt as an oppreffion ; and to remove the 
grievance, and fave the multure, many of them provided fmall hand mills of their own.
The corporation, 
irritated at this breach of what they deemed their right, refufed to grant licences to the refradlory inn- 
keepers.
The public, however, would not comply, but brought an a6lIon at law, to compel them to 
(hew upon what grounds fo intolerable and arbitrary a cuffom refted.
The aftion was determined in 
favour of the vidluallers ; and this became a heavy ftroke to the corporation revenue.** 
About 
t All the ftock in trade, as wool, yarn, cloth, &c.
and all the implements of the work, were fold by aiidlion, at fcarcely 
a fourth part of the value.
• Mr. Dewlicher, for many years after, concealed himfelf in fome part of Scotland.
Some length of time after the 
failure of the company, he once ventured, in an obfeure manner, into the city, and called late in the evening at the Wool .
pack inn, a houfe much reforted to by the workmen.
The landlady’s name who then kept the inn, was Mary Carlyle.
This hofpltable widow entertained him for feveral days ; and taking pity on his indigent circumflances, fhe, at his depar- 
ture, put fomething handfome into his pocket.
He never vvas, after this, feen or heard of in or about Carliile.

CARLISLE, 
462 
About the yenr 1750, the trade of Carliile began to have a different appearance.
A manufaftory of 
coarfe linen cloth, called Ofnabiirghs was eftablifhed :'}• this kind of work can be wrought by women and 
"boys at the loom.
About the fame time, there arofe a new woolen manufaffory, chiefly womens’ wear, 
the proprietor of which was a George Blamire.
From the time of the Dewlichers, the woolen bufinefs 
Itad been almoft entirely neglefted in Carlifle ; the little which was done this way, vvas by three brothers 
of the name of Machrell, from Yorkfliire.
Blamire’s manufa£tory was of fliort duration : and after .his 
time, except what was done by the Machrells, and by one Thorpe, and this to no great amount, the 
bufinefs was no mote purfued by any other adventurer.
At the period we are fpeaking of, the military road between Carlifle and Newcaflle was begun.
Prior 
to this date, this road from the city was by the Englifh gate, and Warwick bridge ; but now the route 
v.'as changed, and travellers go by the Scotch-gate.
The new road was planned near four miles more 
to the north than the old one.
The badnefs of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the 
conveyance of merchant goods from Newcaflle to this place and Whitehaven ; and Dumfries, from this 
circumftance only, had greatly the advantage : but when this turnpike was completed, then the cafe was 
much altered for the better.
Large caits and waggons were foon introduced, and nothing was now 
wanting but a fufficlent loading from Carlifle : this want was in fome fort fupplled by people buying up- 
on commiflion, and others upon their own account, and fending oft large quantities of butter and bacon 
for the London market.
It was now that provifions began to rife in price, the butchers to fell their meat 
by weight, and the country frugal houfe-wife to thiow aftde her old pound ftone, fubllituting In its place, 
the flandard of fixteen ounces for weighing her butter.
Every article of life increafed in value: in the 
mean time the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated afpefl.
John Holmes, Efq. who had 
eftates in different parts of the county,* was a gentleman of a perfevering fpirit, in making trial of the 
feveral modes of agiicukure : no part of hufbandry was loft.
In him for the fake of expence, or procuring 
men ufed to agricultural improvements.
Mr. Holmes’ laudable fpirit opened the eyes of the country in 
general, and every fucceeding year added fomething to the former, to the advantage of the induftrloua 
liufbandman.
It has already been nbferved, that manure was of little value ; that what the ftreets of 
Carlifle afforded was conveyed away, by a perfon who had an annual falary : it now became an article of 
value, and the produce of the ftreets was generally put up to lett along with the corporation lands.
J 
The county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue.
The number of black cattle which 
came into England from Ireland and Scotland, by the way of Cumberland, and moftly by Carlifle, greatly 
increafed tlie value of the toll ; but as the colle£ling of it was attended with trouble and danger, the 
drovers endeavouring to evade this toll as an irnpofttion, it alfo underwent a trial at law, in which the 
drovers were defeated, on the grounds that the barrier fortrefs was ftill maintained : but as the collefling 
of this toll from thefe refraflory^ people, is ftill attended with dlfliculty ; the perfon who undertakes the 
whole farm from the corporation, generally lets it out in parcells to different people, who live moft con- 
tiguous to the places where the clrove.s take their departure out of the county.
At this period, manufadlories of linen ami cotton began rapidly to eiicreafe in Carlifle ; and this 
incrcafe in the branches of fpinning and weaving brought many Scotch and Irlfh weavers, with their 
families, to refide in the city and its environs.
The population of the city had encreafed very little for 
forty or fifty years prior to the eftabllfliment of thefe manufadlories.
The bleaching of yarn was a con- 
fequent of thefe manufaftories, and it went on very profperoufly.
Carlifle is a place very well adapted 
for carrying on the linen ami cotton manufaftories to a very great extent.
The progrels of improve- 
rnent advanced with rapid fteps.
Every year hoiifes were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan, and alfo 
many new ones.
The grafs which disfigured the ftreets, lanes, and avenue.s, began daily to difappear.
. 
In the year (756, a brewery commenced in the fuburbs of the city, without tlie Infli Gates, under 
the firm of Atkinfon and Co. But the inhabitants of Carlifle and the neighbourhood, having been 
long accuftomed to home brewed ale, did not relifli this farftory drink, fo that It was fometime before 
this public brewery met with much encouragement .
though after a few years’ trial the prejudice was 
entirely removed, and the fuccefs of the undertaking has fufficiently proved Its utility, and fully anfwer- 
ed the end the company had In view.
The many new manufactories now begun, and the incrcafe of 
population attendant on them raifed the purvey.
But as this did not then feein grievous to the' a.ncient 
-j- The late aldermen, Richard and William Hndgfon, were the fropricror.s of this Ofnahurgh manufadtoiy.
• This gentleman kept in his own hand, and iinp.'-oved, the following valuable eftates : Braken, or Erakcnhill, Bar* 
rockfide, Karrockfield, Barronling, Dnr lar, Ragmire, Brackenhow, Hclmhill, all in the neighbourhood of Carlifle ; bcftdc*

inhabitants, I only mention it as a prelude to what afterwards became a fevere burthen.
Not long after,' 
^le ftrcets ot the city, aiid that part of the liberties without the walls, were paved upon a new plan.
This alteration for the better (to the great credit of the corporation) removed many intolerable nuifan- 
inhabitants of the fuburbs, and that part of the fubuibs which came under the direflioH 
m furvcyor of the higiuvays, were alfo put under a proper regulation.
Richardgate felt the good 
etieds of ihis a.tcration ; being expofed to inundations from'the overflowing of the river Eden, it now 
felt only in part wliat formerly was alinolt general.
In tire year 1758, were brought here a number of French prifoners from Edinburgh caflle.
Thcfc 
were loon iollovved by the regular troops of Thurot’s fquadron, captured by the brave captain Elliot ; 
and about three or four hundred more were fent to Carlifle, Rem Eaunceftoa in Cornwall.
All ihelc 
pnfoners, except Thurot’s regulars, were upon their parole of honour.
As each of thefe prifoners had 
leven Ihillings a week reguhtly paid them, this caufed a deal of money to be expended.
The French 
pnfoners were foon after followed by the Weflmoiland militia ; and as the inhabitants of that county 
were m.uch prejudiced agalnft a military life, they entered Into a voluntaiy fubfeription to allow their 
balloted men, or mbftitutes, an additional funi to tiie king’s pay, fo that many of the pilvates had from 
one to three fliillings per day.
Two companies of invalids kept garrifon in the cafl;le;{ and did al.o 
duty as centicels at the feveral gates Such a number of men in the city, and fo well circumllanced as 
to money, greatly benefited the place.
The confequence of this influx of wealth was, the introduiftion 
or more expcririve modes of living.
Now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns.f 
J.O this period, 1759, there had not been any public conveyance fur travellers in poll chaife from this 
city.
Hitherto balls and aflembllcj had been kept in a room at the caflle ; and when any o-ave a ball 
It was chiefly at the Bufli Inn : but now an affcmbly room is built, and finlfhed for that purpofe, in a 
plain and neat manner.
Tne year 1761 faw new works eflabliflicd.
A company from Newcaflle begun the calico printing 
bulmcfs, which has been prog refllvely carried on ever fince, and affords employment to many hundreds 
oi men, women, and children.
This was followed by an extenfive manufadoiy, carried on by the in- 
gen lous Bernard Barton, ^whofe preinature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and 
enterpriung traociman.
Thefe public works employed a great deal of good land about the city, fo 
t.iat the value of ground, either in the felling price or In letting, rofe confiderably : and the Increafe of 
population, owing to thefe caufes, may reafonably be fuppofed to occafion an equal rife in every othe«- 
article bought and fold.
’ ‘ 
^ As the year 1761 was an aera of real advantage to Cailifle, both with refpeft to the profpea of an 
mcreafing commerce and the further progrefs of politics ; the reader, we hope, will not deem it impro- 
per, that we a little more particular.
The printing or ftamping of Calico was introduced here about 
this period.
Gentlemen from Newcaflle and its vicinity, under the firm of Scot, Lamb, and Co. were 
the firfl eftablifliers of this branch of trade, m the environs of Carlifle.
And as the Calico bufmefs has 
been Uie principal means of mcreafing the population of the city, it is fufficlent to remark that tlie 
flourilhing advances of this manufadlory induced others to form themfelves into companies to begin and 
carry on the fame bufmefs.
Some of them were men unacquainted with commerce; for In former times 
a countr)'^ tfq.
would have thought it a degradation of his rank, to have his name entered with any 
company in a rnanufadlunng or mercantile line.
Time has removed this prejudice, and men are convinced 
that trade enriches, in particular, tliofe engaged in It, and the public in general.
Common day labour 
tor men not bred to any mechanic trade, and lint or tow fpinning for women In indigent circumftances, 
was all the employment that could be obtained.
Eight pence or ten pence a day, without vltluals, 
as much as a labourer could earn, and a woman mufl have worked very hard at her wheel to make 
a Ihilhng a week.
The employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twilling w-hips for 
which they had only about eight pence per week, and generally worked fixteen hours out of the twenty- 
The eflablKhment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the cafe.
The work In the green or bleach- 
yard found ^ploymcnt for men and flout boys.
Apprentices were taken to the feveral branches of the 
work, VIZ.
Drawers, Cutters, and Calico-printers, at a genteel weekly allowance, and their wages in- 
creafed as they advanced m their fervitude.
Little boys were employed as tearing buys to the printers.

CARLISLE.
664 
Women had tables fet out for them to pencil the colours into the pieces.
Every table employed three 
or four female children ; and even the youngeft boys and girls could make near two fiiillings per week.
€uch encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and fuburbs, and fo 
great was the change, that a common labourer, who probably, with his wife’s alTiltance, did rot mak« 
above eight Ihillings weekly, could, by having his family fixed In the manner reprefented, eafily earn 
twenty ov thirty fiiillings a week.
Nay, fuch was the infatuation of the young men, or defirc of great 
wages, that many who had ferved an apprenticefliip to a mechanic trade, bound themfelves a new to the 
ftampery : and even thofe that were married followed the fame Heps, perfuaded that this manufadlory 
would give the whole family bread.
People of property reaped their advantage from this increafe of 
population, as land and houfes increafed in value.
The feverrd manufaftorles began to thrive much beyond the mofl fangulne expe^latlon.
People in trade, 
•tvith little to begin with, acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more fplendid flyle than 
formerly.
The town rapidly improved, and the land around increafed in value, far beyond what could 
have been forefeen.
The advantages, however, were balanced by fome inconveniences; people of pro- 
perty, who tailed not the fweets of a thriving trade, began to feel the difadvantages which arofe from 
the Increafe of population.
Before the year 1761, the poor rates were not felt by thofe who paid them; 
forty purveys in a year was the annual colledllon.
This was the mode purfaed, and the Inhabitants afted 
in the office of colleifling by rotation.
But the Increafe of manufadlorics invited numbers of llrangers 
here for bread.
1 he town was foon filled with Scotch and Irifh families ; and as thefe people had no 
place to return to, In cafe of indigence and ficknefs, they became a great burthen upon the ancient inha- 
bitants.
This was not the only grievance ; the mode of colledlion was very irregular, being ftill by the 
old rate.
New improvements did not pay any kind of proportion, nor did the manufadlurers, though 
thofe were the only people that throve by this increafe of trade, and the caufe which brought thefe flran- 
gers to the city, pay any kind of rate for their valuable flocks in trade.
This caufed a general murmur 
amongfl the ancient inhabitants, and a redrefs was loudly called for.
A pound rate was thought to be 
the moll equitable mode, and after many veftry meetings it was finally agreed to.
All this time, neither 
the parifli of St. Mary, or St. Ciithbert, had a common workhoufe : the poor were either let out, or 
paid out, in their own houfes.
The parifh of St. Mary feeing the difadvantage which arofe from this 
mode of providing for the poor, entered into a fubfcriptioii to build a workhoufe ; the good effedls of 
which have been felt by the inhabitants, as well as by the poor that rece ve the benefit.
The chief part of the manufatlorlng bufinefs before the year 1761, confifled of a fewchcck and Ofna- 
burg looms, and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen.
But after the eflabllfh- 
mentof the manufaSlory of printed or flamped calicoes, cotton looms were fet up.
The flamperies had 
before this, been fupplied with cottons from Lancaflilre, at an extraordinary expence in carriage ; but 
now machinery for carding, roving, and fpinning of cotton, is creeled in different places in the neigh- 
bourhood of the city, and they purchafe their cottons at a cheaper rate.
This machinery employs a 
great number of men and women, of old and young.
Buildings, particularly in the environs, have a- 
mazingly increafed, and fo has every trade In proportion.

' I HE advantages which may be derived from accurate regifters of mortality, are thus illuftrated 
1 by an ingenious philofopher and phyfician.
“ The eltablifhment of a judicious and accurate 
** regifter of the births and burials, in every town and pariffr, would be attended with the moff important 
“ advantages, medical, political, and moral.
By fuch an inftitutlon, the increafe or decreafe of certain 
“ difeafes ; the comparative healthinefs of different fituations, climates, and feafons ; the influence of 
“ particular trades and manuffuffures on longevity ; with many other curious circumftanccs, not more 
intcrefting to phyficlans than beneficial to mankind, would be afeertained with tolerable.precifion.
In 
** a political view, exa£l regifters of human mortality are of ftill greater confequence, as the number of 
“ people, and progrefs of population in the kingdom, may, m the moil eafy and unexceptionable manner, 
“ be deduced from them.
They are the foundation, likewife, of all calculations concerning the values 
“ of affurances on lives, reverfionar)' payments, and of every fcheme for providing annuities for widows, 
“ and perfons in old age.
In a moral light alfo, fuch Tables are of evident utility, as the increafe of vice 
“ or virtue may be determined, by obferving the proportion which the difeafes ariling from luxury, in-

Carlisle is fituated in latitude 54, 55 north, and is furrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter 
in circumference.
The fituatlon is rendered exceedingly pleafant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers, 
rvith which it is almoft furrounded, viz.
the Eden on the north caft fide, Petteral on the foulh eaft, and 
Caldew on the north-welh The air about Carlifte is pure and dry, the foil chiefly fand and clay.
No 
marfhes or ftagnaut waters corrupt the atmofphere ; its neighbourhood to a branch of the fea, and 
its due diftance from the mountains on all fides, render the air temperate and moderate.
In July 1763, at the requeft of Dr. Littleton.
Lord BIfnop of Carlifle, the Inhabitants were numbered 
with great care and attention by the Rev. Mr.
Richardfon, the Rev. Mr.
Simpfon, and Mr, Alderman 
Hodgfon.
There were at that time in the city and fuburbs, 1059 families, and 4158 inhabitants.
In January 1780, a very careful and accurate furvey was made by Mr. Stanger and Mr. Howard, 
under my own infpedlion.
When there were in the diftriifl, before furveyed, 891 houfes, 1^05 families, 
and 6299 inhabitants — For a more particular account of the furvey.

This aftcnifliing increafe of 2141 inhabitants, which is above half of the oiiginal number, in the fmall

Thia increafc of population too has taken place, during tlrat very period In wliich Dr. Price afierts the

we can with pleafure demonllrate the extreme falubrity of Carlille, 
even in a very unhealthy year ; a year in which no lefs than 1 29 perfons were cut off by two epidemic 
difordtrs, viz.
the fniall pox and fcarlet fever.
By the bills of mortality publilhed in different towns in 
England, as well as the continent, it appears on an average, that in VieiKia about i in 19 and a half of 
the inhabitants die annujdly ; in London, i in 20 and three quarters; in Edinburgh, i in 20 and four 
fifths ; in Leeds, i in 21 and three fifths ; in Dublin, i in 22 ; in Rome,, i in 23 ; in Amllerdam, c 
in 24 ; in Brefiaw, 1 in 25 ; in Berlin, i in 26 and a half, in Northampton and Shrewfbury, i in 26 and 
a half ; in Liverpool, i in 27 and a half ; in Manchefter, 1 in 28 ; in Chefter, i in 40 ; but in the 
year j 774, when tlie fmall pox were very general and fatal, i in 27; and in the parifli of Sedburgh, in 
the county of York, 1 in 37 and a half; and in Blandford Forum in Dorfet, ( in- 39 ; in Carlille, this 
year, 1 in 30 and three ninths — See Table VII.

V. and VI.
are of the utmoft Importance to the phyfician, the politician, andthe 
calculator of annuities, and to every one who has the health and happinefs of himfelf and family at heart.
They clearly demonllrate, as far as one year’s obfervation can have weight, what periods of life are the 
SBoft healthy, what are the raoft obnoxious to difeafe.
As no particular epidemic difeafe occurred laft year, which had any confiderable effeft on the lives of 
adult perfons, it is apprehended thefc calculations for the periods above ten years old, wfill not be attend- 
ed with much variation in ether years.
That women in general live longer than men, is almofl.
univerfally agreed, and the following obferva- 
tlons tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion.
Dining tlie lall year twelve perfons died between 
eighty and ninety years old, eight of thefe were females, and between ninety and a hundred, two died, 
both females.
— See table VI.
In table III.
we fee two people are above 100 years old, and thefe like- 
wife are females.
Table II.
which contains the number of hufbands, wives, &c.
Ihews how inferior in number widowers 
are to widows.
Tliere are above four widows to one widower ; an aftonilhing difproportion ; in what 
manner is it to be accounted for ?
The following caufes are conceived to operate confiderably : 
ift, Men are, in general, more intemperate than women.
2d, They are expofedto greater hardfhips 
and dangers.
3d, Widowers, perhaps, in general, have greater oppoitunilies of getting wdves, than wi- 
dows have of getting hulbands.
4th, Widow's have a greater propenfity to live in towns than widowers.* 
5th and laftly, The conftitutions of males, as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions, are firmer 
and more robull than thofe of females ; their mufcular and nervous fibres, may therefore be fuppofed to 
become ftiff, rigid, and Incapable of performing the fiindtlons necelfary to health and life foono than thofe 
of females, both on account of their original texture, and the fridtioii which muft necefianly occur from 
laborious exercife.
But fiom whatever caufes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may 
arife, the fa£t itfelf is fofficiently afceitalned by table VI.
where we find, that betw-een the ages of fixty 
and feventy, although there are a greater number of w ives than hufbands, yet eleven hufbands and only 
four wives have died, and of all different ages iwenty-nlne hufbands and fi-xteen wives.
During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence, and fwept off a great number of chil- 
dren, viz.
the fmall pox, and a fpecies of the fcarlet fever.
As the perfons affefted with the fmall pox were chiefly of the low'er clafs, who feldom called in medical 
afTvftance, it is impoffible to afceriain the precife number : from the information, however, which I have 
had, it appears, that about 300 were, during the laft fix months of the year, felzed with the fmall pox in 
the natural way : of thefe no lefs than ninety fell v.Idllms to its virulence.
Hence, near one in three died 
of all that were aft'ciffed with the natural fmall pox ; which, while at the fame time, it ferves as a melan- 
choly proof of its fatal effefts, points out the great and falutary advantages which are derived from Ino- 
culation.
During the fame period feveral hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of Carlifle, 
and It is a pleafing truth, that not one of them died.
Had thofe 300 been inoculated, it is more than 
probable, that of the ninety not above fix would have-died ; and even thefe not of inoculation, but of 
other diforders.
Hence w'e fee eighty-four perfons might have been faved to their parents and the 
public.

few, 
CARLISLE: 
TfW, vcrv few, can be prevailed upon, either by promifes, rewards, or intrcatics, to fubmit to the opera- 
tion.
No wonder, that in rude, ignorant, and barbarous times, fuperllltion hurried men into the groflcll 
abfurdities ; when in a polKhtd and enlightened age, in an age too, when the experience of full twenty 
years has clearly demonftrated the utility of inoculation, we fee the bulk of mankind ready to facrillce 
iheir children, and all that is dear to them, to a foolifh prejudice.
For the Year rySo.j The population of Great Britain muft ever be a fuVyeft defer ving the atten- 
tion of every lover of his country, and efpccially fince the commencement of the prefent war, it has be- 
come highly Interelting.
Within thefe few years, fome very able wnters have publKhed their thoughts and calculations on this 
fubjeft.
Thofe who are willing to depreciate the tefoutces of this country, and to magnify thofe of our 
enemies, have endeavoured to perfuade us, that our fituation is truly lamentable, and that population has 
rapidly and progreffively decreafed for this twenty or thirty years pall.
The data from which thefe calcu'ations and inferences have been made, are principally the returns of 
the window furveyors, and the books of the cuftoms and excife.
Others, who from different foutces of information, have attempted to confute fuch fentiments, have 
prefented us v/Ith a more favourable piclure ; they, with much appearance of truth, have endeavoured to 
prove, that the number of inhabitants in Great Britain, inftead of decreafing, has confiderably increafed, 
during the period above alluded to.
In fupport of the latter hypothefis, I think It may not be improper 
to mention the following fafts : — 
In the beginning of the year 1780, I made an aftual, and I believe an accurate, furvey of the two pa.
rifltes, St. Mary’s and St. Cuthbeit’s, and found they contained i houfes, 1872 families, and 7677 
iaiiabitants J A few months afterwards, another a£lual furvey w’as made of the two parllhes, by Mr.
Coulfon, general furveyor of the four northern counties for the window-tax, and Mr. William Monkhoufe, 
furveyor of Cumberland, Leith, and Ellcdale wards ; and though I have every reafon to apprehend, that 
their furvey was much more accurate, than furveys for the window-tax heretofore have been, yet they 
only returned 8 1 5 houfes ; the difference therefore between the real number of houfes, and the number 
returned to the window-tax Is 333.
Now, to Ihew how fallacious all calculations are, with refpeft to the 
number of inhabitants in any particular place, founded on the returns of the furveyors of the window-tax, 
even w'hen they make the moll accurate furvey.
Let us fuppofe I had wanted to afeertain the number 
of inhabitants in Carllfle and the adjoining villages, and had been ignorant of the real number of houfes 
which they contained, 1 firould have multiplied 815 by 6 and two thirds, which Is nearly the number of 
people in each houfe, the prcdudl will be 5433 nearly, which is 2244 lefs than the real number or two 
feverths nearly of the whole.
And if I had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each houfe, I 
fliould moll probably have multiplied 81 J by 6, which would have made the difference fllll more confi- 
derable.
The falubrity of Cailtfle was proved by the bills of mortality publilhed laft year ; and it appears ftlll 
more evident from the prefent, for only i in 34 and a half nearly, of all the inhabitants have died this 
year, In confcquence of difeafes.
See Table VII.
Table VI.
coroborates the obfervations made in the laH year’s bills, viz.
that women live longer than, 
men ; for between too and 103 years old, two perfons died, who were both females ; 26 hufbands, and 
only 15 wives have died, although there arc a greater number of wives than hufbands In Carlifle.
For the Year 1781-] People of all tanks, ages, and conditions of life, enjoyed an uncommon de- 
gree of health during the llrft three months of this year ; for, within that period, no more than twenty- 
three perfons died ; and of thefe, lifteen were cither very young cliildren, or old and infirm.
But about the 
beginning cf April, a very epidemic fever, evidently the Typhus Carcerum, began to make its appearance.
It broke out in a houfe In kiekergate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families ; the ro»ms 
are exceeding fmall, and In order to dimlnifh the window-tax, eveiy window, that even poverty could 
difpenfe with, was flint up : hence ftagnation of air, which was rendered ftill mere noxious by the filth 
and uncleanlinefs of the people.
The furgeon who attended fome of thofe poor wretches, told me, the 
fmcll was fo offenfive and difagreeable, that it was with difficulty he could flay In the houfe, while he 
inquired into the fituation of his patient.
One of the perfons affedled with the fever in this houfe was a 
weaver, who, on his recovery, went to his ufual employment at a large work-lhop, where he communi-< 
oated the diforder to his fellow- weavers, and from thence the fever fpread all over the town.
It, however, 
chiefly, I may almoft fay entirely, raged amongfl.

clally amcngll thofe who lived in narrow, clofe, confined lanes, and in fmall, crow'ded apartments, it

affeftcd adults more frequently than children ; the infirm, than the robufl ; women than men ; and the 
married were more fubjeft to it than the fingle.
Three or four perfons in a family were frequently fei/ed 
with it, one after another.
It was altnoft altogether confined to this place, none being feized with it even 
•in the neighbouring villages, except in a very few inllances, where the feeds of it were evidently carried by 
fome perfons who had laboured under the difeafe.
In the fiiort fpace of abotit eight mouths, near five hun- 
dred perfons were affefted with this fever, forty-eight of whom died ; of thefe, one was under five years of 
uge; ttTO between five and ten ; -one between ten and fifteen ; two between fifteen and twenty ; one be-* 
tween twenty and thirty; eight between thirty and forty ; tirirteen between forty and fitty,: tw'elve between 
fifty and fixty ; fix between lixty and feventy ; two between feventy and eighty years.
The fmall pox were conftantly in town all this year, but made little or no progrefs till towards the 
latter end of 06 lober, when they became rather more general, but they could fcarce ever be faid to rage 
as an epidemic : nineteen only died.
No other epidemic appeared, and indeed, excepting the jail fever, 
this year was by no means unhealthy.
Great numbers were inoculated .both in the town and country 
villages.
During the prefent year, i in 38 and 3 fifths of all the inhabitants have died in confequence of dif- 
eafes — bee Table VII.
The difference of the number of deaths of hulbands ana wives, is not near fo great as it was in the 
years J'jyg and 1780; yet ftill the deaths of the former exceed thofe of the latter by two,; for thirty- 
three hufoands and only thirty-one wives have died, which difference is not the lefs extraordinary than in 
the two preceding years, when w-e confider, in the firfl: place, that the conftitutions of women are more 
predifpofed to be acied upon by the contagion of the Jail Fever than thofe of men ; and in the fecond, 
that they are, from their habits and fituatiens In life, infinitely moreexpofed to that contagion.
Between 
eighty and ninety years of age, five males and four females, and between ninety and an hundred, three 
females have died.
See Table VT.
For the Year 1782.] Upon the whole, this year, notwithftanding it was fo extremely cold and wet, 
cannot be confider ed as an unhealthy one.
The Typhus Carcenwi., or Jail Fever, which raged with fo 
much violence lafl; year, gradually declined, and was fcarccly to be met with after May. Sixteen perfons 
died of it.
And although the fmall pox were conftantly in tmvn, yet they were neither general nor very fatal.
Thirty perfons only died of that difeafe.
In the beginning of June, the Catarrhus Contagr.fus or Influenza became general ; very few families, 
either in the town or country, efcaping its influence.
It is, perhaps, the rnoft contagious of all diforders 
to which the human body is fubjedl ; and were it as fatal as it is infectious, It would foon depopulate the 
world.
When It once breaks out, it does not, like the fmall pox, the plague, or the jail fever, confine 
itfelf toa city, a province, or a kingdom; but traverfes whole continents, and is fornctirnes wafted acrofs 
the Atlantic Ocean.
It has raged no lefs than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in Europe, withiir 
the prefent century, and pretty generally exhibits the fame pheenomena ; yet no barr ier has hitlierto been 
difeovered to arreft its progrefs ; nor have the caufes v/hich firft produced it at each period, been yet 
afeertained.
Fortunately, however, it is a very mild difeafe, differing little from the common catarrh or 
cold, except that the febrile fymptoras are more conftant and rather more fevere.
The Influenza attacked 
every age, fex, and apparently people of every habit ; yet it is evident, a predifpofrtion was required, as 
feveral, and among the reft myfelf, who were frequently expofed to the contagion, efcaped the difeafe.
In what that predlfpafitlon confifts, remains yet to be difeovered.
It finifhed its courfe in tlie neighbour- 
hood of Carlifle, in about the fpace of three weeks or a month ; and its fymptoms were here fo mild, 
that medical advice was feldom fought for.
One peifon only is luppofed to have died of it in Carlifle, 
viz.
a woman fixty-five years of age.
During this year i in 38 of all the in'iabitants have died in con- 
Icquence of difeafes.
— See Fable VII.
Hitherto the number of deaths of hulbands, has confiderably exceeded thofe of wives, each year ; h«t 
during the prefent year, the deaths of wives fomewhat exceed ; for twenty-two wives, and only twenty 
hufbands have died.
— See Table VI.
Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and nine females ; and between ninety and a hun- 
dred, one male and two females have died ; between a hundred and one, and a hundred and two years of 
age, one female, viz a widow, died during the prefent year.

For the Year (783.] The prefent year has been much more healthy, than any of the preceding 
years ; on which, obfervations on the bills of mortality in Carlifle have been made : for, notwithftanding 
the number of inhabitants has confiderably increafed, yet the number of deaths is by no means fo great, 
one hundred and eighty one perfons only have died.
No dangerous or fatal epidemic, except the fmall pox, raged with any degree of violence.
— The wea- 
ther, during the latter end of June, the whole of July, and part of Augull, was extremely hot and fultry | 
the atmofphere was replete with the eleftric fluid ; and there was more thunder and lightening than ever 
was remembered, even by the oldell perfon.
This ftate of the atmofphere was by no means peculiar to 
the neighbourhood of Carlifle, but was pretty univerfal throughout Europe.
In September and Odfober, the fmall pox became fo general, and were of fo fatal a kind, that the 
monthly committee of the difpenf ry were of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and indi- 
gent inhabitants, would be attended with very beneficial efietls.
Early in the month of November, a ge- 
neral inoculation accordingly took place.
Great numbers were inoculated, not only by the furgeon to 
the difpenfary, but alfo by moll of the other furgeons in the town.
By this falutary meafure the city of 
Carlifle was, in the fpace of two months, totally freed from a moll dangerous and fata!
difordcr, which 
has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmofl violence.
The number of perfons affedled 
•with the natural fmall pox in Whitehaven, within the lafl fix months, have been almoft Incredible, and it 
is a melancholy truth, that Icarcely one in three furvived.
In Wigton and its neighbourhood they have 
been al:o extremely general and fatal.
Twenty nine hufbands and twenty three wives have died this year — See Table VI.
Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and feven females, fix of whom were widows; and 
between ninety and an hundred, one male and one female have died.
—See Table VI.
Nineteen only fell viilims to the fmall pox, and feventeen of thefe were children under five years of age.’ 
Apoplexies were remarkably fitquent this year ; no lefs than nine perfons having died of that dif- 
temper.
— The number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the feafons ; forty -feven died in winter, 
forty-two in the fpring, forty five in the fummer, and forty- feven in autumn.
— See Table IV, 
During the prefent year, i in 43 and i-yth of all the inhabitants have died in confeqtience of difeafes.
— See Table VII.
For the Year 1784.] In the obfervations on the bills of mortality for lafl year, I took notice of 
the extreme healthinefs of that feafon ; it is, however, with peculiar fatisfadlion I am able to inlorm the 
public, that it has been far exceeded in falubrity by the prefect.
One hundred and fifty-four perfons only have died, which are fewer by twenty-feven than died laft 
year; and in the year 1779, the number fwept off by two difeafes only, viz.
the fmall pox and fcarlet 
fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year, whether cccafioncd by difeafes or acci- 
dents.
This remarkable degree of healthinefs may be accounted for, from the abfence of almoft all epidemical 
diforders ; for not one made its appearance except the fmall pox, which vt'ere of a very mild kind, and 
proved fatal to no more than ten perfons, nine of whom were under five years of age.
How to account 
for the abfcnce of all other epidemic and contagious difeafes, is not fo eafy.
With refpeft.
to the weather, 1 fhall only remark that the prefect year commenced and ended with the 
fevereft and longeft continued frofts ever remembered fince the year 1 740.
The fummer too was uncom- 
monly cold and wet, and yet was the healthieft fcafou, as may be feen by examining table IV.
Whether the feverlty of the froft bad any effefl in purifying the air, and hence rendering it unfavour- 
able to the propagation, &c.
&c.
of epidemical diforders, perhaps, may be doubted ; but it certainly ope- 
rated mod powerfully in the production of an obllinate cutaneous riifeafc, by phyficians denominated.
Herpes; but by the common people and empirics, called fccuivy, tliough it is effentlally different from 
that difordcr.
This cutaneous complaint, viz.
Herpes, has been extremely prevalent, and remarkably obllinate thefe 
two lall winters, and has appeared under a variety of forms.
The number of deaths ol hufbands ftill continues to exceed that of wives, and this year in a very great 
proportion, for twenty-nine hufbands have died, but only twenty wives.
— See Table VI.
Four widowers, and twenty -four widows have died.
Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and nine females, eight of whom were widows; 
and between ninety and an hundred, one male and three females have died.
— See Table VI.
Hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females ; but this year it is the reverfe, 
for 121 males and 153 lemales have been chiiftencd.

During this year, 1 in 50 and i-6th nearly, of all.
the inhabitants have died in confequence of difeafes.
<— See Table VII.
For the Year 1785.] The prefent year, like the laft, was ufhered in by a very fevere and long con- 
tinued frofl.
There was alfo a confiderable fall of fnow ; and a complete thaw, which was flow, gradual, 
and without rain, did not take place till near the middle of Apiil.
The thaw was fucceeded by cold 
eafterly winds whxh continued a long time; and a greater degree of drought was fcarcely ever remem- 
bered.
The fields were parched, the fprings and rivers were almoft dried up,, citcumftances not to be 
•wondered at, when we confider that there was no rain, a very few flight fhowers excepted, fiom the month 
of Oftober.
1 784, till the 29th of July.
On that day we had, in the neighbourhood of Carlifle a great 
deal of thunder and lightning, accompanied by a moll violent and heavy rain ; and from that time, till 
ne r the end of the year, the weather became molft and warm.
Notwithllanding this long continued drought, the weather was never exceedingly hot or fultry ; 
which may probably b the leafon why dangerous diforders were not more prevalent.
For this year was 
far from being unhealthy, no epidemic difeafes occuriing, but fuch as had arifen before the diy and warm 
feafon came on ; which therefore, could have no elfedl in producing them.
Very early in the month of January, the jail fever, which 1 believe firft originated among the felons 
confined in the jail, began to make its appearance in the city, and continued to rage almoll the whole of 
the year.
As the pooreft clafs of nhabitants chiefly fuffered from it : its progrefs, &c.
will be bell af.
certained by examining the books of the difpenfary, where I find four patients, labouring under the dif- 
order, were admitted in the month of January; four in February ; four in March ; three in April; 
eight in May ; eight in June ; ten in July ; fifteen in Augufl ; nineteen in September ; eleven in Ofto- 
ber ; and eleven in November.
, In December it feems to have almoft entirely ceafed, for not one was 
admitted during that month.
Ninety-feven patients, afiefted with this fever, were therefore admitted 
into the difpenfary in the fpace of eleven months.
The prefent epidemic was of the fame nature as that which appeared at Carlifle in the year 1781', 
and of which I publifhed an account.
It, however, differed in fome few particulars, which difference I 
ihall briefly relate.
I. It did not rage fo univerfally, the contagion, probably, not being fo virulent.
2. The fymptoms, in general, were more mild.
3. Petechise and haemorrhages were feldom obferved.
4. 
A greater proportion of children were affedled.
5. Rtlapfes were much more frequent.
In the fever 
of 1781, I did not fee one inftance of a relapfe; whereas in the prefent, it was a very common ctreurrv- 
fcance ; feveral patients having even two relapfes.
Of the ninety-feven patients labouring under this fever, and which were admitted info the difpenfary, 
only four have died, who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admifficin, and two of them fo 
much exhaufted, as not to be able almoft.
to take any medicine ; viz.
Margaret Storey, of Rickergate, 
a married woman, aged forty-two years, who died on the third day after admiflion ; and Mary Wilfon, 
of Nanfon’s lane, a child, aged three years, who died two days after admiflion.
If we, therefore, omit 
thefe two, as cafes already defperatc, ninety-five will remain, of which only two died, which is exadlly 
one in forty-feven and one half.
, A circumflance which fttongly marks the efficacy of the pradlice, and 
more efpecially when it is confidcred, that almoft the whole of thefe patients were confined, during iheir 
illnefs, in fmall, clofe, dirty rooms, where, in fome cafes, fix' perfons weie ill at the fame time ; and fome- 
times even three of them in one bed.
In the whole city nine perfons died of this fever.
Before I conclude this part of my fubjeft, I cannot omit cbferving that tbe difpenfary has expended 
upwaids of tbiily pounds for wine, all of which was c< n fumed by perfons affefted with thisdifeafe 
Early in the month of December, 1784, the fmall pox were inti*jduccd by fome vagrants, into the 
Damfide, Iiifh Gates,, to the neighbourhood of which they were confined fome time, but afterwards be- 
came general, and coi.tinued till the latter end of July, 01 beginning of iiguft, when they entirely ceafed.
Fight patients affedle ' with tbe natural fmall pox were admitted into the difpenfary in the month of 
January ; eight in February ; two in March ; twenty-one in April ; nine in May ; and four in July ; in 
all fifty two ; twelve of whom died.
Total of deaths of thisdifeafe, thirty nine, who were all under five 
years of age.
As one in four and one third died of all thofe who were admitted Into the difpenfary, it is highly pro- 
bable that of the whole nun .her who laboiiied under the natural fmall pox, many of whom had not the 
leaft adv'ceor aifillance, one in four would die, w'hich makes the number aff 6led, one hundrc<i and fift)r- 
fix As foon as the difeafe made its appearance within the walls of the city, the monthly committee 
®f the difpenfary refolvcd, that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants, agreeable to the plan which 
' I /had 
CARLISLE.
^73 
I had propofcd in the year 1783,* fliould take place at the difpenfary, and it was with great pleafure I 
obfcrved the prejudices of the vulgar againll that moft falutary invention, were greatly diminiflied.
For 
as foon as the refolution of the committee was made public by the common crier, great numbers from all 
quarters of the town flocked to the difpcnfary, to reap the benefits which it held out to them.
No lefs 
than ninety-one were Inoculated at the expence of the charity, and rather more than that number by the 
different pradtitioners.
So that upon a moderate calculation, the whole number inoculated this year, 
amounted to two hundred ; every one of whom not only recovered, but had the difeafe In a very favour- 
able manner.
As we have ftated it as probable, that one in four died of the natural fmall pox, it is there- 
fore probable that fifty lives were faved by this general inoculation ; and if all thofe affedled in the natural 
way had been alfo inoculated, no lefs than eighty-nine lives would have been preferved.
JJuringthis year i in 37 and i— 7th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died — See Table VII.
Apoplexies and paralytic ftr okes were very frequent ; no lefs than eight fuffered from the apoplexy.
As ufiial the number of deaths of hufbands continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-nine hufbands 
have died, anl only twenty-five wives.
— See Table VI.
Nine widowers, and twenty-one widows have died this year.
— See Table VI.
Perfons between the ages of ten and fifteen, and fifteen and twenty years, have been ailoniflilngly healthy.
When I made the fur vey of Cariifle in the beginning of the year 1780, there were between ten and fifteen, 
feven hundred and fifteen ; and between fifteen and twenty years of age, fix hundred and feventy five per- 
fons: In all, one thoufand three hundred and nkiety.
Since that period the inhabitants have unqueftion- 
ably Increafed much ; It is therefore very probable, that at prefent there are not lefs than one thoufand 
four hundred and fifty perfons between the age of ten and twenty years, and yet of this number only two 
have died.
— Sec Table V.
The prefent year, however, feems to have been fatal to old people, between eighty and r.Inety years 
of age, eight males and fix females, five of whom were widows j and between ninety and an hundred, 
two males and four females have died.
— See Table VI.
The number of males born greatly exceed the number of females ; for, 148 males, and 1 19 females 
have been chriftened.
— See Table VIII.
For the Year 1786.] Altho igh we had not nearly fo much frofl this year as the laft, yet in other 
Tefpefts, the weather, during the prefent fpring and fummer, greatly refembled that of the year 1785, 
The winds, which were dry and cold came chiefly from the eaft during the whole of the months of March, 
April, and a part of May, which made the fpring late ; and although the drought which fucceeded was not 
of equal duration, yet it was much more intenfe, and confequeiuly the fields exhibited the fame parched 
and and appearance they had done the laft fummer.
Refrefhifig rains fell towards the middle of July ; 
the autumn was fine; and a more mild and open winter was feldom or ever remembered.
There was fcarcely aiiy difference in the falubrity of the two years, two hundred and four perfons 
dyirrg the la'l, and two hundred and five In the prefent year.
June, July, and Auguft, which were the 
hutteft months, were by far the moft healthy, for only twenty-four perfons died during that period.— Sec 
Table IV.
On the contr ry, Oftober, November, and December, were the moft unhealtlry, during which eighty- 
three deaths occurred : See Tabic IV.
— This difference, hoviever, did not feem to proceed from any 
alteration of the atmofphere, hut from the meafles, which were introduced into the town fome time ia 
Auguft, and raged, during thefe three months, with the greateft violence.
About two o’clock on Friday morning, uguft 11th, a flight (hock of an earthquake was very fenfibly 
felt by many perfons in Cariifle and the neighbourhood.
Thofe who were perfectly awake, or who hap- 
pened to be out of doors, report that the concuffion continued about four or five feconds ; and that it was 
immediately pi eceded by a hollow tremulous found.
Many were awakened out of their fleep, by the

Birds in cages were likewlfe fenfible of its 
influence, and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed.
Very providentially, however, little or no 
damage was fullained ; a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down, and three people 
in Whitehaven were thrown off their feet.
But in other refpedls, a momentary fright and alarm were 
the only inconveniences which were fuffered from it.
The concuffion feemed to take its diredfion from 
the eaft to the weft, and extended quite acrofs the ifland, being felt both at Newcaftle and Whitehaven.
And from the north towards the fouth, it extended from Glafgow to the northern parts of Lancalhire.
The atmofphere on Wednefday and Thurfday preceding, was moift, gloomy, and fultry ; and fo much 
fb, on Thurfday night, that a lady, who was on a vifit at Dalllon, adlually foretold when Ihe went to bed, 
that an earthquake would take place before morning.
Friday was a very clear, hot, calm, fultry, day.
Early in the fpring, the meafles made their appearance in the fouth-weft parts of Northumberland, 
where, I am informed, they proved very fatal.
From thence they gradually advanced farther fouth, and 
the infedlion began to operate in Carlillc about the beginning of Auguft ; and as this epidemic had not 
viftted us fince the year i 780, there muft confequently have been a great number of children who were 
liable to be aftedfed by the contagious matter generated by this di fouler.
Fleuce the infedtion fpread 
rapidly, and the difeafe foon became general, and continued to rage till the latter end of December, or 
beginning of January, 1787, when it altogether difappeared.
Notwithftanding, however, the diforder was fo very general, yet its fymptoms were extremely mild and 
favourable : for, of the great number who were aft'eAtd, -I (hould fuppofe not lefs than fix or feven hun- 
dred, only twenty-eight died, and the greater part of thefe were the child’ en of the very pooreft and 
lowcft clafs of inhabitants, who were either too ignorant, or too obftinate to call in medical affiftanee.
Of 
the twenty-eight who died, twenty-fix were under five years of age, and two .were between five and ten 
years old.
Another epidemic, viz.
the chincough, occurred pretty early in the year, but this difeafe made little 
progrefs, until Oftober, and even then did not become very general.
Only nine children who were all 
•under .five years of age, died of it, and fome of thofe were affedfed with the chincough and meafles at the 
fame time, and therefore probably fuffered from the joint effefts of both.
During the prefeiit year, i in 37 and j-bths nearly, of all the inhabitants died in confequence of 
difeafes.
— See Table VII.
The number of deaths of hufhands ftill continues to exceed that of wives ; twenty-four hufbands have 
died, and only twenty-one wives.
— See Table VI.
Between eighty and ninety y'ears of age, one male and five females, who were all widows ; and between 
.ninety and an hundred, two widows have died.
A man who had long been a foldier, and who muft confequently have been fnbjedi to many varieties 
and viciffitudes of life, died at the advanced age of 105.
For the Year 1787.] In the beginning of January, 1780, the Inhabitants of the two patifhes of St.
Mary’s and St. Cuthbert’s, Cariifle, were very accurately numbered by Mr. Stangcr, Mr. Howard, and 
myfelf.
At that period thefe parifhes contained 3491 males, and 4186 females, in all 7677.
Sometime in the year 1787, an order was iffued from the court of Quarter Seffions, to the different 
conftables in the county of Cumberland, to make an aifual furvey of all the inhabitants of the county.
The furvey was accordingly made at Cariifle in the latter end of December ; but, as the motives which 
induced the magiftrates to illue this order were not generally known, many gentlemen refufed to give 
an account of their families.
The abbey, as being extraparochial, and the townfhip of Wreay, through 
fame miftake, were altogether omitted in this furvey ; hence it is evident, the lifts delivered in to the 
jQuarter Beflions are .very erroneous.
I, however, had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above pariflics very minutely, and 
as the conftables marked down the names of all thofe perfons who refufed to give them information, I 
was enabled to make up the deficiency, by procuring the numbers in each of their families, and I am 
perfuaded the enumeration is now pretty exaift ; but if there be any error, it will be on the fide of defici- 
ency, rather than of excels.
From this furvey, thus correfted.
It appears that the two parlfhes of St. Mary’s and St. Cutbbert’s, 
contain at prefent 3864 males, 4813 females, and confequently 8677 inhabitants.
— Fora more particular 
account fee Table III.
There has therefore been an increafe.
In the fpace of eight years, of a thoufand Inhabitants ; which Is 
a circumftance, that muft give great pleafure to all thofe who are well-wlfhers to the profperity of the city 
of Cariifle.

The Chriftcnings of DifTenter* thefe three years were not obtained.
The DilTentcrs are included in the Columns of the Males and Females.
CARLISLE, 
From what caufes, it may he anceJ, has this rapid increafe arifen ?
It affords me confiderable fatis- 
faftion to be able to inform the public, that it has principally been owing to two general caufes, viz.
The fulubtity of ike place, ani the increafe of trade and marnfalturei.
The former is clearly proved by 
the great exctfs of births above deaths; for, during the lafl eight years, the period in queftion, 2071 
children have been baptized, and only 1582 perfons have been buried.
The births, therefore, exceed the 
deaths 489.
The latter, viz.
the increafe of trade and inanufadiurej, is proved by an ingrefs of Inhabitants 
into Carlifle, exceeding the emigration out of it, during the fame period, 511; which numbers together 
make up the increafe of 1 oco.
Inoculation, I am.
ptrfiiadecl, has alfo greatly contributed to the increafe of population, not only in 
Carlifle, but likewife in the whole county of Cumberland.
In the year 1779, when the lower clafs of 
inhabitants were extremely averfe to this falutary difeovery, no fewer than ninety perfons died of the na- 
tural fmall pox ; whereas only 151 have died during the eight fucceeding years ; which is, upon an ave- 
rage, not quite nineteen in each year ; and yet that difoider prevailed in every one of thefe years.
(See 
all the bifls of mortality whiLh have been publilhcd ) Since that period, viz.
1779, the prejudices of 
the vulgar againft inoculation, have greatly dimintflied, and will foon, I doubt not, be totally eradicated.
And lince the inftitution of the difpenfary, the poor have enjoyed tire privilege of having their children 
inoculated gratis ; an advantage which they have, in general, with great readinefs embraced.
The frift four months of tire prefent year, greatly refembied the beginning of the year 1779.
The 
w'eather in both was remarkably mild and temperate, for there w’as fcarce any froil in either.
The com- 
mon daify was in full flower on new-year’s-day, and continued in bloffom almoft the whole year : the 
Piimrofe began to blow on the iff of February : and the Colt’s-foot and Barren Strawberry very early in 
the fame month : in firort, all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or fix weeks before their 
ufual time.
The ftate of the weather, how'ever, throughout the year, was the reverfe of 1785 and 1786 ; 
thefe years were remarkably hot and dry ; this was cold, gloomy, and uncommiOnly wet, infomuch that 
there never was a year in w hich, probably, more rain fell than in the preCent.
The late h)r.
Carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain w'hich fell at Carlifle during a 
period of twenty years, viz.
from the year 1 757 to 1776 inclufive, which his fon, the Rev. Mr.
Chancellor 
Carlyle, has been kind enough to communicate to miC.
Dut Ing this period, the greateff quantity which fell 
in any one year, was thirty one inches and a few lines ; and the medium depth of thefe years w^as only 
twenty four inches, eight lines and a lialf.
Unfortunately, fince 1776, no regular meafure has been taken 
at Carlifle; but Dr. Campbell, a very ingenious phyfician at Lancafter, has fent me a table of the 
quantity which fell at that place during the prefent year ; and from which It appears, that it amounted 
to the almoff incredible quantity of fifty-one inches and one line.
The rain, therefore, which fell this 
year, is confiderably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year, on an average of 
twenty year’s calculation, and exceeds, in quantity, twenty Inches what fell in the weteft of the above 
years.
It muff, however, be obferved, that Lancaffer Is fituated fomewhat nearer the w'eftern ocean than 
Carlifle ; and that the hills to the eaff and north-eaft of that place, are nearer it than the hills about 
Carlifle, which, in all probability, will make fome difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each 
place.
Notwithftanding the very great moifture of the atmofphere, above related, yet the prefent year was a 
healthy one, and the laff fix months were rem.arkably fo ; feventy-three perfons only died during that 
period.
— See Table IV.
The fmall pox made their appearance in January, and w'ere in Carlifle the greateff part of the year; 
hut Inoculation foon became general, whicli prevented the diforder from raging wn’th any great degree of 
violence.
Thirty only died, tw’enty-eight of whom were under five years of age, and tw'o between five 
and ten years.
Eighty, our were inoculated at the difpenfary, all of whom nut only furvived, but had 
the diforder very favourably ; and confiderable numbers were hkewife inoculated by feveral furgeons in 
the town.
The putrid or jail fever alfo prevailed almoft the whole year ; but as It neither became general, nor 
malignant, till the beginning of 1788, I fiiall at prefent only obfetve, that fourteen peifons fell vidfims 
to it.
The difference In the number of deaths of hufbands and wives Is this year very' confiderable ; for thirty- 
four hiifbands have died, and only twenty-two wives.
— See Table VI.
Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and five females, (the latter w'crc widows ;) and 
between ninety and one hundred, ore male and two females have died.
— See Table VI.
During the prefent year, only i In 44 nearly, of all the Inhabitants have died in confequence of difeafes ; 
and 
'CARLISLE, 
676 
and upon an average of the laft nine years i In 39 and i-4th has died See Table VII.
It mall be re- 
marked in the firft place, that every infedllous and epidemic difeafe, to which the human body is fubjedt, 
(the plague excepted) prevailed during this period at Cailifle ; and In the fecond place, that the calcula- 
tions were made for the hrft eight years : from the number of inhabitants which exillcd in the beginning 
of the year 1780, the great increafe (of one thoufand) not being afeertained till the prefent year 1787.
Therefore, although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for feveral of the fit ft 
years ; yet, upon the whole, the mortality is ftated to be greater than it aftually is.
— Sec fable VII.
The deaths which occurred from accidents, were.
In 1779, four; in 1780, three; In 1781, five; In 
1782, four; In 1783, three ; in 1784, five ; in 1785, four ; in 1786, two ; and m 1787, two.
From table VII.
it appeals that the mofl healthy period of human life Is from ten to fifteen years of 
age, and that health declines in the following order, viz.
between 20 and 30, — 15 and 20, — 5 and 10, 
—30 and 40, — 40 and 50, — 50 and 60, — 60 and 70, — under 5, — 70 and 80,— 80 and 90, — 90 and lOO.

Dr. Heyfham’s tables of deaths and difeafes of perfons of different ages arc om.tted, as wholly apper- 
taining to medical fubjedls.
I fhall conclude the obfervations on the bills of mortality, with an account of a very curious and Important 
circumftance in phyfiology, which occurred at Carlifle during the prefent year.
A child was born, apparent- 
ly at the full time, not only alive, but which lived and took nourifhment feveral days, without the fmalleft 
veftige of a brain.
In all my reading I do not recolledl to have met with fo extraordinary a phenomenon ; 
nor does it appear that Profelfor Monro, who has fpent the greateft part of his time in anatomical and 
phyfiological purfuits, has either feen or read of any thing exadlly fimilar.
He has indeed, in his inge- 
nious obfervations on the ftrudlure and funftions of the nervous fyftem, publifhed in 1783, favoured the 
wor'd with fome plates, which reprefent the heads of two children, born at the full time, in which the 
bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting, and in which the brain, which is ex- 
tremely fmall, projefts like an excrefcence.
In thefe two inftances, however, there was a fm Jl portion 
of brain In each, and though both the children are ilated to have been born at the full time, yet it does 
not appeer that they w^ere even born alive, much lefs that they lived any time after birth ; for, if either 
had been the cafe, we cannot fuppofe that a gentleman of Dr. Monro’s great accuracy, would have omitted 
circumftances fo remarkable ; but I think we may, on the contrary, infer from his filerice, and from the 
following conclufions, which he himfelf draws from the above-mentioned monftrous produdlions, and which 
1 (hall take the liberty of quoting, as the work is not In every perfon’s hands, that they were really bom 
dead : — 
“ Nay v/e may, perhaps, go a ftep farther, and doubt whether, inftead of confidering the brain as the 
“ origin of the nerves, we ought not to confider it merely as connedled with the nerves : or whether there 
“ are better reafons for fuppofing the brain to produce the nerves, than for fuppofing the nerves to pro- 
duce the brain.
Some fadls, at kail, may be here obfeived, which feem to drew that the nerves may 
« cxift, independent of the brain.
“ I.
In children delivered at the full time, plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs, 1 have 
obferved the fubftance which fupplied the place of the brain, not more bulky than a fmall nut ; and, 
“ inftead of containing a white medullary fubftance, it was of a red colour, refembling a dot of blood : 
“ and fmall cords, occupying the place of the optic nerves were likewife of a red colour.
Yet the fpinal 
marrow, and all the nerves from it, had the ordinary fizeaud appearance.
“ II In a monftrous kitten, with two bodies and the appearance of one head, I found the Spinal mar- 
row of one of the bodies conneded with a brain and cerebellum of the common fliape and fize.
But the 
fpinal marrow of the other body, though equally large, had only a fmall button of medullary fubftance 
at its upper end, without a fuitablc brain or cerebellum.
account of a Female Child ’which was born at Carlifle, at the full Time, alive, and which lived five 
Days ctnd twenty-one Hours, without the ftnallejl ap[>earance of a Brain.
At eight o’clock on Monday morning, May 26, 1788, Mary Clarke, aged 26 years, and the mother 
of fix children fome of whom are healthy and others unhealthy, was delivered of a living female child, at 
the expeiice of the Carlifle difpenfary.

Tlie midwife, (hocked at the (Irange and iinxifual appeararvce of the child’s head, fent for me immedi- 
ately.
I got ther about an hour after the delivery, and at firft fight, it appeared evident that the bones' 
which form the upper part of the fcull were wanting, and that the brain was only covered by its proper 
membranes, the pia and duta 7fiater, and refeinbled a large excrefcence which projefted a little over the 
common Integuments, efp cially towards the forehead, where it extended over the root of the nofe.
The 
colour of this fubftance was a dark reddifli brown, and upon examining it more particularly, I thought I 
could perceive the divifion of the two hemifpheres of the brain, and likewife thedivifion of the cerebrum 
from the cerebellum I gently raifed with my fingers, a jiart of it which projedled over the integuments, 
which made the cliild cry, and pioduced a confiderable darting, fimilar to what is occafioned by an eled^ric 
(hock.
The child was full giown, and feemed in pei fed health, her limbs were plump, firm, and well 
proportioned, and (he moved them with apparent agility.
The external organs of fenfe were alfo perfeft.
She fwallowed well, and took a fulBcient quantity of nourifhment for feveral days, but fometimes during 
the aftion of fwallowing darted a little.
She lived till five o clock on tuinday morning, June the id, 
when (he expired Some- time before her death (he was afledled with flight convulfions.
Lmring the 
thiee or four days preceding her death, there was a conflant difeharge of a thin wa ery fluid, fomewhat 
tinged with blood, from the excrefcence, which greatly diminifhed its bulk ; for at her death, it was 
only about halt the fize of what it had been when (he was born, and the fvirface was, in fome places, 
beginning to put on an appearance of mollification 
A few hours after her death, Dr. Blamire, and Mr. Charles Farifh, accompanied me to the houfe, 
where Di. Blamire \eiy cautioufly diffefttd, away from the bones, the whole of the fubdance; when we 
(bund the greated part of the frontal, the temporal, the occipital, and the whole ol the parietal bones 
wanting.
The fubdance removed was then carefully examined, and what was our adonifhment to find it 
entirely to confid of membranes, blood-velfels, but principally of feveral bags ; one of which was afe largd 
as a nut-meg, the red of different (izes, but much fmaller.
They were ail filled with a brownilh coloured 
duid ; which, when the cylls were pundlured, gufhed out with fome violence.
There was not the lead appearance of cerebrum, cerebellum, or any medullary fubdance whatever.
The fpinal marrow had a natural appearance, but did not feem to have been connedled with the parts 
above deferibed.
Having accurately related the faft s as they appeared to Dr. Blamire and myfelf, which for their fingularlty 
dtferve to be recorded ; I think the few following obvious inferences maybe drawn from them i.
That 
the fluid difeharged from the excrefcence during the life of the infant, and which produced the great dimi- 
nution of its bulk, was occafioned by the lupturc, or erofion of cyds, fimilar to thoie which remained found 
and full of water after death.
2d, That the living principle, the nerves of the trunk, and extremities, 
fenfation and motion, may exid independent of, and that the natural, vital, and animal functions, may be 
performed witliout the brain.
And as the external organs of fenfe, viz, the eyes, the nofe, the tongue, 
arrd the ears, all feemed perferff ; may we not, therefore, fuppofe, that the optic, the olfaiflory, the guda- 
tory, and the auditory nerves, may exid independent of, and unconnefted with either the brain or fpinal 
rharrow ?
I content myfelf with little more than deferibing this extraordihary cafe, and leave to others to deduce 
from it, fuch conclufions a; the appearances obferved may be thought to warrant.
For the Year >796.] In themon.h of April, this year, a furvey, under the ch're^Iion of the editors, 
was made by Mr Johndon, a ptifon of accuracy and attention, who found that the two paridies of Sr.
Mary and St. Cuthbert contained 1587 houfes, 2616 families, and 10,289 inhabitants.
It therefore 
appears that the increafe fince 1780 has been 2612 ; and (irtce 1787, 1612- — For a more particular ac- 
count of the different furveys which have been made, fee Tables I.

Soil and Produce.
J The foil is very different in quality and fertility: a fandy or gravelly loanr 
•prevails in the vicinage of Carlifle and Carleton: a loam, in which clay predominates, is found in mod 
other parts of thefe parlfhes, particularly about Botchardby, Hanaby, Uprightby, Blackball, and mod 
parts of the chapel of Wreay.
About Cumerfdale, a greyifh foil covers a llratum of clay.
Towards the 
louthern and wellern extremities, are confiderable trails of moorifli foils, which, not many years ago, were, 
very barren commons ; but which, by inclofure and proper management, are now generally in a pro- 
greffive date of improvement.
Land near Carlifle is chiefly applied to the purpofes of dairying, breeding and feeding fheep, growing, 
hay for horfesj &c.
Wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the bed drong foils ; a fallow gene- 
rally precedes.
On foils having a confyJerable portion of land, turnips, barley, and clover, or other 
artificial grades, are beginning to be much fuwn, which Is found to be a very profitable fydem.
Pota- 
toes form a confiderable article of cultivation In thefe parifhes.
On the late inclofed commons, oats is 
the mod prevailing crop : that grain alfo has its turn in the courfe of hufhaudry in more fertile didtifls, 
as have peafe and heans.
I an, forry to add, that the barbarous and unprofitable fydem of taking two 
or more white crops In fucceflion, though yearly lofing ground, has yet its advocates here The great

breed.
The danding docks are improving in finenefs of bone and wool, 
znd iRclInation to feed, by tups of the Improved breed from the docks of Mr. Cullcy, and other eminent 
ftreep-breeders in Northumberland.
Mr. Porter of Carlifle ranks among the fird who introduced that profitable breed Into Cumberland, 
and is now in pofleflion of a valuable dock, wlilch depadure upon the Swifts.
Cattle are generally of the 
bed Cumberland breeds ; but the cow keepers about Carlifle feem to prefer the fhort horned, or Dutch 
fort ; fome of which, when properly fed, afford a very great quantity of milk.
There are indances of 
feme giving forty quarts per day (wine meafure) for a few weeks after calving ; thirty quarts is not very 
uncommon, and twenty-four frequent.
She is, however, edeemed a good cow, that afiords from dxteen 
to twenty quarts of milk per day for great pait of the dimmer.
Thefe cows are fed with the mod luxu- 
riant grafj.in fumnxer, hay in winter, and generally grains or potatoes every day In the year.

bf feeding is heavy : but the moft experienced cow keepers have found that the gieat fecret of profit- 
ing by cows, is to feleft the heft milkers, either of -the Dutch, Lancalhire, or Galloway breeds, and to 
feed them with fufficlent quantities of the beft food.
That however, it muft be acknowledged, is a 
praft ce not much followed in moil other parts of this county.
Rivers and Fish.] The Eden, Caldew, and Petterel, water thefe parllhes.
Thefe rivers abound with 
trout, eel, and other forts of fmall fi(h, common In the country.
In the Eden large quantities of falmon 
are caught.
The waters of Caldew and Petterel, and particularly the former, are remarkable for the 
quality of bleaching white.
It is rather an unpleafant refleftion, that thefe rapid dreams, fo peculiarly 
adapted to the purpofe of turning machinery for miles above Carlifle, more particularly the Caldew: and 
by a proper application of which, that city might be rendered almoft the Birmingham of the north, fhould 
only be employed in giving motion to three or four folltary corn mills, and a few cotton works.
The King-Garth Fishery.] A little below Cargo, is the King-Garth fifliery, which the corpora- 
tion of Carlifle, held under the charter of Edward III.
and having given rife to a fubjeft of fome notoriety 
in this part of the county, a few years ago, it may not be amifs here to give a iliort account of it.

This filhery of the corporation (being a fcveral fijlicry) extended only acrofs the dream, between 
Cargo-holm and Carbed, and fo hath been lod, by the river altering its courle many years ago.
The 
fifhery in that part of the river where the dell was lately placed, belonged to Lord Lonfdale; and was, 
till lately, under leafe to the corporation.
The device for catching fidi, called a Stell, nfed by the ledees 
of the corporation, was a net acrofs the water, tied to dakes drove In for that purpofe, which caught 
or dopped mod of the falmon ; it being only In high doods that any could get pad it : by thofe means 
the other fifiierles higher up the river, were become of trifilng value.
For remedy whereof, an aftion was commenced.

fifheries, againd the ledees of the Corporation upon the datute 2d.

(which datute 
exprefsly prohibits the danding of nets fadened to pods, continually day and night, overthwart the river 
Thames, and other rivers of the realm : under the penalty of 100 diilhngs for every ofience).
— This 
aftion came to a hearing at the adizes at Carlifle, the fame year, before judge Buller ; when a verditl 
was given for the plaintiff : and which, on a new trial the year following, was confirmed.
Since which, 
that fifhery hath been occupied by Lord Lonfdale’s agents, in the ufual way of nets drawn by hands.
It may be obferved, tlrat, this matter was about being brought to a legal decifion, about fifty years 
ago, when the double paflage in the river occafioned the difficulty of obtaining redrefs, in regard the 
nets not being entirely overthwart the fame, within the defeription and meaning of the ai£f.
The corporation are alfo entitled to a free fifoery (generally called a boat in this river, which 
was granted by the charter of Edward IV.
There are from this part of tlie river up to Carlifle, about feveUteen other boat fiflilngs, belonging to 
at leaft, as many different proprietors ; the annual value of which are various, between 61 .

Roads.] Are tolerably good.
Two old fafliioned narrow ftone bridges, over two branches of the 
Eden conneft Carlifle with Stanwix.
Caldewgate is alfo connefted with Carlifle by two ftone bridges 
over as many branches of the Caldew.
Two roads, the one from the foutb and the other from the eaft, 
crofs the Petterel ; and at each place there is a ftone bridge.
The road from London to Edinburgh, and 
that from Whitehaven to Newcaftle, interfeft thefe parifhes in different diieillons.

Thole of moll note are on the Petterel near Newbiggin, and thofe near Durdare and Burnthwaite.

Near Quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alabafter, or gypfiim.
Buildings are generally pretty- 
good, and covered with blue or red flate: a few houfes are yet thatched, and fome are even built w'itL 
clay walls.
Tithes.] A confiderable part of thefe parilhes pay tithes in kind ; and a portion pay a modus In lieu 
thereof.
School.] At Blackball, a donation amounting annually to 5I.

was left by the late Thomas.
Lpwry, Efq. of Blackball, for the education of feven poor chlldr.'-..
Woods and Plantations.] The banks of Caldew are cloathed with wood, principally oak ; fome 
fmall plots of woodland appear in other parts, and a few trees grow on hedge-rows.
Several hundred acres 
of the moft barren parts of the common, when they were inclofed, were planted with foreft trees, and 
chiefly Scotch fir: they have fucceeded beyond the expedlation of everyone, and now not only beautify 
the country, and Ihelter the farms in the neighbourhood, but will ultimately prove very profitable to the 
proprietors.
Rearing of wood is the moft profitable way of applying moft barren foils.
Aspect and General Appearance.] Though this dillridt contains many irregular, but gentle 
fvvells ; it is as level, and perhaps more fo, than moft parts of the county : the general inclination is to- 
wards the north, but fmall.
The extenfive vales, formed by the Eden, the Caldew and Petterel, are level, fertile, and beautiful ; 
they incircle Carlifle, which rifes on a gentle eminence in the centre, and commands a pleafant profpeft 
of the adjacent country.
Among other delightful views which appear from that city, the neat houfe, 
gardens, &c.
of William Richardfon, Efq. at Rickerby, are feen beyond the verdant fields through which 
the Eden winds its way, and forms an excellent objeft.
Mr. Lofti of Woodfide is making every thing fmile round him : his houfe, his garden, his farms, are 
almoft daily under his improving hands : laud too barren for tillage he plants with wood.
Between 
Woodlide and Durdare is a tra£l of very poor ground, divided, but not inclofed, nor cultivated : Mr. Lolh 
ha£ lately purchafed a fmall part thereof for 2I.

per acre, inclofed and planted it with foreft trees: 
the other proprietors, it appears, have not yet difeovered liovv much it would be to their advantage, 
either to difpofe of their (hares to Mr. Loih ; or follow his example in turning them to profit.
County Ga©l at Carlisle.] Is old, much out of repair, and without the regular means of fup- 
plyiiig the different rooms with frefli air, fo neceffary In thefe wretched receptacles of guilt and misfor- 
tune.
The celebrated Mr. Howard defcribes it as follows : — 
“ The court fpaelous, 85 yards by 36 : it was common to all prifoners ; but now a part is appropri- 
“ ated to the felons, and feparated by iron palifades.
In the court is a chapel, built as appears by the 
“ date, in i 734, Five rooms for mafter fide debtors : and as many on the common fide.
Moft of the 
“ latter are large, but have windows to the ftreet.
Where there are fo many rooms, not to feparate 
“ the men and women is certainly inexcufable.” 
“ The wards for felons are two rooms, down a ftep.or two ; dark and dirty.
One of them, the day 
‘‘ room, had a window to the ftreet ; through which fpixituous liquors, and tools for mifehiet, might be 
“ eafily conveyed : but It is now bricked up; the night room is only 1 1 feet by 9.
At my laft vifit, 
7mn and ’women were lodged together in it.f Two rooms over the felons’ wards, which have been 
ufed as tap rooms, feem to be Intended for the ’womtn only,t but in otts of thefe I alfo found three 
and four wcwfw, lodged together.
No infirmary * Tranfports had not the allowance of two 
“ ftiilllngs and fixpence a week.
Claufes againft fpirltuous liquors, and ai 5 l for preferving the health of 
“ prifoners, not hung up.
Gaol delivery once a year.
Few.gaols have fo many convenient rooms for 
“ common fide debtors.
It is the more remarkable here, becaufe there is no table figned by the magif- 
“ trates, to particularize the free w-ards.
Some gaolers avail themfelves of fuch a circumftance, and 
“ demand rent for looms which were undoubtedly defigned for common tide prifoners.” 
The furniture is provided by the prifoners.
and is generally wretched in the extreme.
Mr. Mullinder, 
the prefent gaoler, feems, however, to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circum- 
ftances will admit.
The rooms and paffages are vvhitevvalhed once a year ; and the felons’ rooms 
(wholly compofed of ftone) cleaned of all noxious matter, by burning a large quantity of ftraw upon 
the floor, fo that diforders rarely prevail there.
We would, however, recommend a more frequent ufc

of lime as a wa(h : being convinced, that, nothing is more conducive to the prevention, or eradication 
of infeAioiis.
The prifoners have an opportunity of purcliafing milk and vegetables, every day, in 
great plenty.
No ale nor fpirits are now fold in the gaol : and it is mueli to be wiflied that intoxica-- 
ling liquors were very fparingly allowed to be brought therein.
The magiftrates for the county have had it in contemplation, thefe feveral years, to build a new goal, 
in the caftle-grecn : and liave prepared a large quantity of (tones for the purpofe : a fituation we can- 
not too much recommend : but from what leafon the defign is not forwarded, we are not informed.

Housman’s Notes.
BIOGRAPHY, ADDITIONS, CORRECTIONS, iAc.
The following account of the late Rev. RICPIARD BATY, M.
A. re Cor of the parifj of 
Kirkandrews upon E/k, ivaj mijlaid when the account of that parijh went to prefs.
H e was born in the parifh of Arthuret, and received his academical education, in the unlverfity of 
Glafgow, where he was admitted to the degree, M.
A. 1725.
Pie afterwards became curate ®f 
Kiikandrews ; and in this fituation, his exemplary condufl, and faithful difcharge of the minifterial 
duties, recommended him, fo effedlually to Lord Vifcount Prefton ; that, on the death of Mr. Torford, 
he prefented him to the redtory, 1732.
As there was no parfonage houfe, nor glebe appropriated to 
the living, on its feparation from Arthuret, he built the houfe contiguous to the old tower at Kirkan- 
drews, with barns, (tables, &c.
entirely at his ov/n expence ; having lirft obtained a Icafe of the fituation 
and farm there, during his incumbency.
The parifh is divided by the river Elk ; and as there is no 
bridge on this part of it, he built a boat for the benefit of the inhabitants, and employed a man con- 
ftantly on Sundays, to ferry over thefe who lived on the eaft fide of the river, to and from church.-— 
As aifiduoufly promoted the building of the fchool houfe, near Meadhope (endowed by Lady Wid- 
lington and her fifter) ; as the inllruftion of poor boys and girls depended, very materially, on fuch 
an accommodation : and for the information of thofe of maturer years, he printed, at Ncwcallle 
(1750) a fermon on the facrament ; with prayers for the ufe of perfons in private, and of families, 
which hedillributed liberally amongft them.
With the fame views he publifhed (i75>) a fmall volume 
entitled, “ Seafonable advice to a carelefs world” or effays, &c.
: and finally 1756, “ The young- 
clergyman’s companion in vlfiting the fick” : all thefe without his name.
It was his conftant cuftoin 
to rehearfe his fermon aloud, in his own room, every Sunday morning ; and w'ith fuch emphafis and 
gefture as he wifhed to adopt in the pulpit ; — a praclfce, which he recommended to the younger 
clergy.
He was (Irilful as an occulifl ; and under that charadler was confulted by many from very remote 
fituations : his advice and applications w-ere always gratuitous.
His temper and manners were mild and conciliating.
It may, therefore, be eafily believed, that he 
was extenfively acquainted with the gentry and clergy of the borders both of England and Scotland ; 
and in confequence of this, fupported a degree of hofpitality ; which (all things confidered) might, 
perhaps, have been honourably abridged.
He died in the year 1758 j and was fucceeded in the living 
by the late Dodtor Graham, of Netfaerby.

LIFE OF JOHN BOWSTEAD.
In the parifh of Warwick, viz.
at Aglionby, was born, yohn Bonujiead, a perfon remarkable for his piety, 
and great induftry, in attempting to reform the manners of the people.
In the fcventeenth year of his age 
he joined in fociety with the people called Quakers; and in his twenty- fecond year a difpenfation of the 
everlafting gofpel was committed to his charge, and he became an able minifter thereof, being properly 
called thereto and qualified for the facred office, under which influence he laboured with diligence, not 
only in England and Wales, but feveral times through Scotland, and twice in Ireland, through whofe 
miniftry great numbers were added to the Society ; he preached the gofpel freely, was zealous and bold 
in contending for the faith, and able to render a reafon for the hope that was in him.
He was faithful 
to the ancient teftimony againft the oppreffion of tithes, fuffered the fpoiling of his goods patiently, and 
died at Aglionby, in the year, 1716: in the fifty-feventh year of his age, and thirty- fixth of hij 
tniniftry.

PURVEY AND LAND TAX.
The rate or rule of taxation called purvey (from the French p'Airvoire i.
e. providere) feems to be in 
vfe only in this county ; the origin of which is faid to be derived as follows, viz.
The prerogative of' 
purveyance and pre emption, which was a right enjoyed by the crown, until the aft of 12.

of buying up provifions, and other neceffaries, for the ufe of his ****** houfehold at an appraifed valu- 
ation, was become very oppreffive to the fubjeft before its abolition.-.- — King James the 1.
when on a 
journey to Scotland, about the year 1617, obferving the poverty of this part of the kingdom, condefeen- 
ded as a mark of his royal favour, to compound this branch of his prerogative in this county for a cer- 
tain fum of money to be occafionally paid in lieu thereof, and which fum was then, or foon afterwards, 
fixed at look : hence the fame, on being appointed throughout the county, obtained the appellation of 
a purvey-rate, which rate has uniformly been the mode of railing the land tax, and certain parochial dues 
ever fince ; where look is raifed it is termed one purvey, where 200k two purveys, and fo on the propor- 
tions of the refpeftive wards, parifhes, townlhips, &c.
would probably be afeertained by the authority of 
the magiftrates at their county feffions, and from a manufeript account of fuch proportions, which wc 
have been favoured with, dated in 1695, there feems to have been very little vaiiation therein during the 
Jaft century.
With refpeft to the land tax in this county, it may not be improper here to notice the laudable and 
patriotic zeal of Sir Wilfrid Lawfon, of Ifel, who, being member for the county in the year 1764 
(when it was in agitation to caufe a new valuation of eftates to be made throughout the kingdom, for 
the more equal affeflment of the land tax) carried to the houfe of commons, a loaf of barley bread, a 
pair of wooden flioes, &c.
in order to evince the poverty and low manner of living in thefe northern 
counties, and argued fo powerfully againft the policy of the meafure, that it mifearried ; and fo the land 
tax hath continued here aS in other parts of the kingdom, to be raifed by affefllng a particular fum upon 
each county, according to the valuation given in A.
D. 1692 (purfuant to the land tax aft of the fame 
year, 4th William and Mary, Ch. I.) The fum with which this county is charged, when the land tax 
is at 4s.
in the pound, is 3713k 18s.

ADDITIONS, 
T N oitr acco«nt of tlie parifii of Hcflcet we omitted to notice a well conriruftcd Hone bridge, of one arcli, 
it over the river Pcteril, near Caitliwaite, built in the years 1792 and 1793, by fubfeription.
In mentioning 
this circumflance, it is but jnftice to the memory of a worthy iuoiv'dual to remark, that the public are indebted 
for this very neceflary and long wifned for accommodation to the patriotifin and activity of bfr.
Dixon, of 
Calthwaitc : that gentleman not only took the trouble of colle£ting the fubferiptions, but forwarded the un- 
dertaking by every other poffiblc means.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO CORRESPONDENTS.
W E cannot conclude this laborious publication, without repeating our acknowledgements to the gentiemeit- 
by whom we have occafionally been affiiled in it ; and whofe names are already mentioned in the body 
of the work.
That thefe contributions have not been both more numerous and more important, we own, has 
difappointed and mortified us : becaufe it is hardly polSble a work of this nature ftiould be cither fufSciently 
correft, or fufficiently complete, without the liberal afiifiance of perfons on the fpot.
There is, however, one 
correfpondent in particular, to whom our obligations are fo numerous and fo great, that we ihould hold ourfelves 
inexcufable, were we not to exprefs our gratitude for them in the moft earneft terms: and alfo to.
inform his 
countrymen of Cumberland, as well as the Inhabitants of the northern counties of England in general, and 
Scotland in particular, of the probability there Is of liis conferring on them ftill greater obligations, by another 
work, in which we underftand he is engaged, requiring an immenfe company of refearch, labour and learning.
— 
This work is a.
large and complete gloffary, on a new plan, of all the dlalefls in the kingdom, but particularly 
thofe of the north ; together with the archaifnis, idioms, and other peculiarities of the Lnglifh tongue.
— How 
well this gentleman is qualified for this great undertaking, fome judgment may be formed from the fpecimens 
occafionally e.xhibited in thefe volumes.
Befides feveral large and valuable additions fcattered all over the vo- 
lumes, but particularly in the firft parts, we are proud to acknowledge ourfelves indebted to the Rev. J.
BOUCHER, of Epfom, In Surry, a native of Blencogo, in this county, for the articles with the fignature of 
Biog.
Cume.
and alfo for the accounts of the feveral parifhesof Bromfield, Sebergliam, and Calclbeck ; in each 
cf which pariihes, vve underftand, he has fome property.

poifoned by eating yew, hemlock, 8c aconite; & often die 
in confequence of eating grofs, fucculent clover, which 
fills anddiftends them to an amazing degree witht^ind.
If this diflention be obferved in time, they are eafily 
cured, by making a perforation with a ftiarp knife thro’ 
the flank into the cavity of the belly ; upon which the

— The mole is fometimes of a fine

me, by William Dacre, of Kirklinton, Efq. The neft: 
of the mole is of a curious conftruftion ; I have exam- 
ined feveial, and found them anfwer the defcrlptloni 
given by Buffon, I (hall therefore tranferibe what that 
author fays upon ihe fubjedf.
The habitation where they depofit their young, 
merits a particular defeription, becaufe, it is conftruc- 
ted with finguiar intelligence.
They begin with rai- 
fing the earth, and forming a pretty high arch.— 
They leave partitions, or a kind of pillars, at certain 
diftances, beat and prefs the earth, interweave it with 
the roots of plants, and render It fo hard and folid, 
that the water cannot penetrate the vault, on account 
of its convexity and firmnefs.
They then elevate 
a little hillock below, upon which they lay herbs 
and leaves for a bed for their young.
lu this 
fituation they are above the level of the ground, and 
confequently out of the reach of ordinary inunda- 
tions, and are, at the fame time, defended from the 
rains, by the large vault which covers the internal 
one, upon the convexity of which, they reft along 
with their young.
This internal hillock, or vault, is 
pierced on all fides whh iloping holes, which defeend 
ftill lower, and ferve as fubterraneous paffages for 
the mother, to go in quell of food for herfelf and

U. All the riTigtalls which 1 have difle^led, and they 
«re not a few,' were females ; and all the henharriers 
males.
The fame circumftance occurred to Kramer 
who opened twelve henharriers and found them all 
males ; and thirteen ringtails which were females.
12.
The young when taken from the neft, are all of 
the fame colour, and refemble the ringtail, but are of 
difiFerent fizes.
13.
The irides of young birds are not yellow.
In the year 1783, I had at the fame time, and with- 
in 500 yards of each other, three nefts of the ringtail 
and henharrier, upon Newtown-common, about a mile 
and a half from Carlifle, in fome very young plantations 
of the late Mr. Davifon : — the firft had feven eggs, 
the fecond had fix eggs, and the third had four young 
ones when I found them.
A ringtail was upon each 
neft ; but the henharriers did not appear.
I vifited 
them again, a few days aftej, in the evening : at the 
neft with young ones, the ringtail was upon the neft, 
and the henharrier foon after appeared, they both flew 
about me and darted at my head ; and, particularly, the 
henharrier came within a few inches of m.y head, twen- 
ty or thirty times, when 1 was handling the yoUng.— 
They were both very clamorous, and had the fame note.
On the neft which had feven eggs I found the ringtail, 
and one young bird was hatched, the henharrier came 
very foon, and the fame feene took place, as I have de- 
feribed, at the other neft.
A few nights after, Mr.
George Blamire accompanied me.
We firft went to 
the neft with yonng ones : both birds darted at us with 
great fury ; I defired him to fhoot the henharrier ; he 
fired at him, wounded him, but he got away and we 
never faw him more.
We then went to the firft neft, 
the ringtail was upon it, and there were now fix young 
ones.
The henharrier did not appear.
When the 
young of the third neft were fit for taking, Mr.
Blamire Ihot the ringtail for me.
June the 27th, the 
Rev. Mr.
Shaw went with me to the firft neft, with 
fix young, they were of confiderable fize, but not fea- 
thered : the ringtail was upon the neft, and he {hot her 
immediately ; the henharrier did not appear.
1 left a 
rat trap near the neft.
Next morning, viz.
the a 8th, 
I went again and found the trap had not been touched, 
but there were two birds, viz.
a lark and a fpatrow, in 
the neft.
While I remained I did not fee the henharrier, 
but as I was certain, from the fmall birds in the neft, 
that he had been there fince the ringtail was killed : I 
went again at noon, and found one of the young birds 
caught by the neck in the trap.
The lark and fparrow 
were gone, and in their place were two yellow hammers 
I fet the trap and baited it with one of the yellow 
hammers, and retired into a fmall plantation of fir trees, 
about fixty yards from the neft ; I there lay concealed, 
and In lefs than five minutes, 1 both heard and faw the 
henharrier.
He foon went to the neft, fed the young 
ones with what he had brought, then attempted to feize 
the yellow hammer in the trap, and was taken by the 
leg.
I feiit thefe birds to Mr. Latham.
Both the 
ringtail and the henharrier, of the fecond neft, which 
bad fix eggs, and which were aH hatched, were always 
Mery fby, and never came within fhot.
Of the four 
young birds which were taken out of the neft, frem 
which Mr. George Blamire wounded the henharrier, 
and killed the ringtail; one, viz.
the fmalleft, waS 
killed, by the others, in a few days.
A fecond 
died, or was killed by his companions, on the 20th 
of March, 1784: on dlffedlion I found it to be a 
male, the teftes were very diftintft, and were beginning 
to fwell : his weight I could not afeertain, as his com- 
panions had eat a confiderable part of his breaft : there 
was no alteration in his plumage ; but the it ides had 
undergone a confiderable change, being at his death a 
yellowifh white, September 14th, 1784, 12 o’clock at 
noon, I weighed the two remaining birds which were 
empty, not having been fed fince three o’clock in the af- 
ternoon of the 1 3th.
The larger weighed i yjoz.
and the 
fmaller 1 1 oz.
and 2 drs.
They had neither of them chan- 
ged their feathers, and did not then appear to be In moult.
The irides of the fmaller were of a yellowifh white; the 
Irides of the larger were but little altered.
The larger 
died, in Februaiy, 1785 ; on diffefllon fcvcral eggs 
were found in the ovary.
The fmaller li'Jed till the 
middle of March, 1785: the teftes were very diftinft, but 
not much diftended, and there was not the leaft change 
of colour in the feathers.
Thus we fee a male and a 
female lived very near one year and three-quarters, after 
they were taken from the neft.
It Is highly probable, that confinement and a differ- 
ent J^ind of food, either greatly retards, or altogether 
prevents the change of colour.
In June, 1785; I had 
three nefts upon Newtown-comrnon, and had frequent 
opportunities of feeing both birds; which were henharri- 
ersand ringtail.s; and which were almoft all flrot when fly- 
ing about us at the nefts : fince that time 1 have fecn fc- 
veral other nefts, but never obierved either two ringtails 
or two henharriers at the fane neft.
The duke of Buc- 
cleugh’s gamekeeper has deftroyed fome hundreds, and 
has frequently fhot both male and female from the fame 
neft: lord Carlifle’s gamekeeper has done the fame.— 
The henharrier never fits upon the eggs, but will fupport 
the young after the ringtail is killed.
They make their 
neft upon the ground ; and the eggs are white, and ra- 
ther larger than a pigeon’s egg.
Hence it Is evident they 
are male and female, and not two diftinft fpecies.

— This beautiful bird only vifits 
Cumberland occafionally, and then only in the winter 
fcafon.
In the beginning of the year 1787, great 
numbers were killed in the north of England.
What 
diftinguilhes this from all other birds, are horny appen- 
dages from the tips of the fecondary feathers, of the 
colour of the very fined red fealing wax.
The females 
are faid to be diftinguilhed from the males, by the want 
of the appendages and yellow marks in the wing fea- 
thers; which, however, is not the cafe, as will appear 
from the following account.
One of thefe birds was 
found dead, in Feb. 1784 near Burgh on the fands : it 
had fix crimfon appendages at the end of the fecond 
quills : the lips of the quill feathers rather a dirty white 
then yellow.
I could not didinguidi, upon difledtion, 
whether it was male or female.
On the 8th of February, 
1787, Mr. Story lent me a fpecimen, which was killed 
rear Kefwick : on the right wing were fix of the horny 
appendages, on the left only five : five of the quill fea- 
thers, and one of the fecondaries in each wing, were 
tipped on the outer margin with a fine yellow ; on dif- 
feftion thh proved to be a female.
On the fame day 
a flock of five or fix of thefe birds were feen, feeding 
on the fruit of the hawthorn, near Blackwell, a mile 
and a half from Carlifle.
Two of them were (hot and 
fent to me ; one had feven red appendages on the right 
V'ing, and fix on the left ; the other had fix on each 
wmg : only four of the quill feathers had yellow tips, 
and the yellow in both was much paler than in the lajl.
They proved to he males.
On the 14th of February, 
3787, Mr. Harrifon of Penrith fent me another, which 
was killed near Temple Sowerby.
On each wing were 
feven appendages, much larger than in the former, — 
Five of the qudl feathers, and one of the fecondaries in 
each wing (as was the cafe of the female fent by Mr.
Story) were tipped with yellow ; the appendages were 
much larger than in the four preceding fpecimens, and 
the four neareft the body W'ere the largeft ; this bird 
was a male.
On tiie 22d of March, in the fame year, 
I received another, which w'as killed at Ravenfworth, 
and fent to me by Sir. Henty^ Liddell, Bart, on the 
right wing there were eiglit, on the left feven appenda- 
ges, which were large.
The two extreme ones, viz.
the neared and farthefl from the bo<ly, were the fmall- 
eft.
The fecond, third, fourth, and fifth from the 
body were the largeft : fix of the wing feathers were 
tipped with yellow.
In this bird all the tail feathers 
had alfo red hoi ny appendages at the ends of the lhafts, 
which, however were much fmaller than thofe on the 
X &c.
were become fo putrid, that 1 conoid not, after the 
A moft accurate examination, afeertain whether it was 
0 male or female.
The red appendages and yellow tips 
X on the wings does, therefore, not depend upon the fex, 
^ but moft probably on the age of the bird j and the fex, 
y I am perfuaded, can only be afeertained by diffedtion.

ber.
Mr. Hodgfon, furgeon, at Burgh ujxin the fands, 
a village about five rriilcs from Carlifle, has obferved 
that the martins which annually build their nefts under 
the eaves of his houfe, always difappear either on the 
19th or 20th of September.

martins, and one of them entered an old neft.
The martin lays five white eggs, and begins to lay 
about the 27th of May In a neft which I examined, 
the firft of June, there were five eggs, and on this day 
the female began to fit.
On the 12th of July, the 
young birds, for the firft time, began to leave the neft, 
they therefore muft have remained in it about twenty- 
eight days after they were hatched.
' Jul^r-T jth, the 
foundation of a new neft, about fix inches from the old

In getting the ft three pair, became torpid on the iqtli ot September, 
egg out I broke the ncft : the next morning I faw a V when the higheft degree of the thermometer was 62,

Auguft 27th, I emaminedboth X and the medium heat of the whole day was jb-f.— —

it ; the old neft contained one young bird ; which, X and debilitated as they muft in fome degree have been, 
from its fize, had probably been hatched about a week, q by the duties of incubation and fupporting their young) 
On the 17th of Auguft, I examined fevcral martins’ y lemaining alive and active on the 23d, when the high, 
nefts, under the eaves of a houfe In the country, all of X eft degree of the thermometer was only 54, and the

September 12th, the young 5 medium heat of the whole day was only 50?
Yet

It is therefore evident that y thefe three pair remained here till the 7th or 8th of 
martins have annually, during their refidence in this X Oftober.
But if, on the other hand, martins migrate, 
country, two broods.
September 19th I apprehend | nothing Is more rational than to fuppofe that thefe 
they all difappeared except a very few, w'hofe fecond v three pair were prevented from accompanying their 
brood had not left their nefts; for, from that day till X companions on the 19th, by an inftindt, fuperior to

— The goatfucker vifits Cumberland about the 
middle of May, and difappears about the middle of Au- 
gud.
Towards the latter end of June, or the begin- 
ning of July, they lay two eggs, upon the bare ground, 
which, in colour, very much retemble the plumage 
of the bud.
Their food confids entirely of infefts, 
which they prey upon only during twilight.
In the 
male there is an oval white fpot on the inner webs 
of the three fird quill feathers, and another at the ends 
of the two outermod feathers of the tail.
None of 
the young birds have thefe white marks on the wings 
or tail.
All the males have them when they appear 
with us in the fpring and iummer : it is hence evident 
they moult during the time of their difappearance.-^

173 The male is dif-

The Heron, in winter is a folitary bird, and frequents 
marfhy places, and the banks of rivers and ftreams.
— 
In the fpring, it is gregarious : like rooks, great num- 
bers of them breed together, and build their nefts in 
the higheft trees.
Food, fifii and reptiles.
A remarkable circumftance, with refpeft to thefe 
birds, occurred not long ago, at Dallam Tower, in 
Wfftmorland ; the feat of Daniel Wilfon, Efq.
There were two groves adjoining to the park ; one 
of which, for many years, had been reforted to by a 
number of herons ; who there built and bred.
The 
other was one of the largeft rookeries in the country.
The two tribes lived together for a long time without 
any difputes : at length the trees occupied by the 
herons, confiding of feme very fine old oaks, were cut 
down in the fpring of 1775, and the young brood per- 
ifticd by the fall of the timber — the parent birds imme- 
diately fet about preparing new habitations, in order 
to breed again : but, as the trees in the neighbourhood 
of their old nefts were only of a late growth, and not 
fufficlently high to fecuie them from the depredations 
of boys, they determined to effetft a fettleme..t in the 
rookery : the rooks made an obftinate refiftance ; but, 
after a very violent conteft.
In the courfe of which, 
many of the rooks, and fome of their antagonifts, loft 
their lives, the herons at laft fucceeded in their attempt 
♦—built their nefts — and brought out their young, 
,s ] 
X The next fcafon the fame contefts took place, which 
U terminated like the former, by the victory of the 
;{ herons ; — Since that time, peace feems to have been 
Q agreed upon between them : the rooks have rellnquifti- 
0 ed poftefiion of that part of the grove which the 
X herons occupy : the herons confine themfelves to thole 
0 trees they firft feized upon ; and the two fpecics live 
together in as much harmony as they did before their 
X quarrel.
This bird, which is now feldom or ever feen upon a 
X table, was, in former times, efteemed very delicate 
X food.
“ In the 27th year of the reign of Edward 
y “ the firft, an order was made concerning the price of 
X “ vidluals ; a fat cock to be fold at three halfpence, 
A “ a fat capon for twopence halfpenny, two pullets for 
5 “ three- half-pence, a goofe for fourpence, a mallard for 
X “ three-half-pence, a partridge for three-half-pence, a 
“ pheafant for fourpence, a heron for fixpence, a plo- 
X “ ver for a penny, a fwan for three fhillings, a crane 
A “ for twelvepenee, two woodcocks for three-half-pence, 
^ “ a fat Iamb, from chriftmas to fhrove-tide, for fixteen-

rare, occur of their breeding in England.
Like other 
birds, they are fubjeft to variety in colour.
On the 
8th of Oilober, 1786, I met with a fpecimen ; the 
general colour of which was a flue pale alh colour, 
with frequent bars of very delicate rufous.
The tail 
was brown, tipped with white : the bill and legs were 
flelh colour.
In Lancafhire great numbers of wood- 
cocks are taken in traps, in moon light nights : long 
rows of Hones or {licks, about four or five inches 
high, are made on the commons where the woodcocks 
frequent.
In thefe rows feveral intervals or gateways 
are left.
In which the traps are placed.
When the 
woodcock, running about in fearch of food, comes to 
one of thefe rows he will not crofs it, but runs along 
the fide of it till he comes to a gateway, which he 
enters and is taken.

They make their 
nefts upon the ground, and lay from ten to fifteen eggs.
In the year 1794 ; my fervants, when mowing a field

They were covered with a darkifh brown coloured

They were taken out of the neft and put into

neft, but they immediately wandered from it.
The 
old birds did not appear while the men continued 
mowing in the neighbourhood of the neft.
Two days

5. The neck of the largeft dun diver, and which

On the 26th of December, 1783, I dlftedled a

He further 
informed me, that although he had frequently fiflied 
above the bay at Armathwaite, this fpring, he had only 
taken three /ry.
Several intelligent anglers have alTured 
me, that they have frequently taken fry in the month 
cf May, which have been above 5 oz.
in weight, but 
they aie unable to fpeak accurately with refpedl to 
their leug.h.
During the firll week of May, the w'eather being 
very favourable for angling, upwards of three hundred 
dozen of fry were taken with the fly, in the Eflc, be- 
tween Longtown and the mouth of that river.
1 did 
not, however, hear that any of them w'cre above 9 
inches in length ; but it is a common obfervaticn, made 
by the fifhermcn w'ho frequent both rivers, that fry are 
never fo large in the Lflc as they are in the Eden, 
whielr is owang, in all probability, to falmon fpawning 
confidcrably earlier in the latter river than they do in 
the former.
In fry of a large or even moderate fize, the mem- 
branes which contain the milt and roe are very di(lin£l, 
but the ova are too minute to be diftinguifiied by the 
naked eye.
Hitherto, in fpeaking of fry, I have confideted them 
as the young of the falmon only, but there is no doubt, 
bat that many of them are the produce of the gilfe, 
fea trout, and whiling, all which flfh fpawm in our 
rivers.
That feme of them are the young of the whi- 
ting has been clearly afeertained by experiment.
Se- 
veral fry, into the fins of which filver ware had been 
inf.rtcd, have been taken in the month of July, full 
fiztd whitings.
On the 13th of May all our rivers 
were a little fwelled, which carried almoll all the fry 
into the fea, very few being taken after that day.

3. Pen, Zool 145 — The fea trout Is very- 
plentiful both In the Efle and the Eden, and appears 
about the latter end of March or beginning of April.
They vary in fize, from i to 3 or 4 4 - lbs.
in weight.— 
When they have fpawmed they return to the fea.— 
April 13th there were three in tlie market.

V 27th I examined one, which weighed 1-4 lb.
It was 
a female.
The roe weighed 35 gis.
the eggs were 
fmall, hut very diflindl.
May 14th I examined a fe- 
male — Length 2i-|- inches — Circumference ic-|- inches

The roe w'cighed 2 drs.
and 35 grs.
The eggs were double the fize of the former.
May 
25th I examined the largefl which has yet appeared in 
the market, it was a female, and weighed 44-lbs.— 
The roe weighed 5 drs.
and a few of the eggs were 
nearly as large as a fmall white pea, but I apprehend 
tbefe were in a difeafed (late.
June 22d the roe of one, which weighed 24 lbs.

it proved to be a male, and the firft which I have either 
feen or heard of this feafon.
The milt weighed only 
54 grs.
Hence it appears that the females of this 
fpecies, as well as of the falmon, run up the rivers long 
before the males.

54 - Bull Trout.
— This fpecies has, I believe, ne- 
ver been defcribed by authors, having been confidered by 
them as a variety of the fea trout.
All the firtiermen in 
this county however confider it as a diftindf fpecies, and 
can diftinguifh it from the former at the firft glance.
— 
The head is thicker than the head of the fea trout, and 
it is alfo deeper at the fhoulders.
The fcales upon the 
back are fmaller and not fo n\imerous.
The tail fin is 
fhorter, and can fcarcely be faid to be forked.
The 
dead or baflard fin is placed nearer the tail, and further 
from the dorfal fin than in the fea trout.
They vary 
in weight from 2 to 10, and even 2olbs ; but, in ge- 
neral, feldom exceed 7 or 81 bs.
The flefh, when cut, is much whiter than the other 
fpecies, and is very infipid.

Branlin or Samlet.
Pen. Zool.
148.-— As 
this fifli is, in general, confidered by the fifhermen in 
this county to be the fry of the falmon, 1 think it 
v'ill not be altogether improper to tranferibe the whole 
of what Mr. Pennant fays upon the fubjedf.
“ The famlet is the leaft of the trout kind, is fre- 
quent in the JVye^ in the upper part of the Severn, and 
the rivers that run into it, in the north of England, 
and in Wales.
It is by feveral imagined to be the fry 
of the falmon ; but our reafons for dilTenting from 
that opinion are thefe : 
Firft, It is well known that the falmon fry never 
continue in frefii water the whole year ; but as numer- 
ous as they appear on their firft efcape from the fpawn, 
all vanifh on the firft vernal flood that happens, which 
fweeps them into the fea, and leaves fcarce one behind.
Secondly, The growth of the.
falmon fry is fo cjuick- 
and fo confiderable, as fuddenly to exceed the bulk of 
the largeft famlet : for example, the fry that have quit- 
ted the frefti water in the fpring, not larger than gud- 
geons, return into it again a foot or more in length.
Thirdly, the falmon attain a confiderable bulk before 
they begin to breed : the famlets, on the contrary, are 
found male and female*, (diftinguifhed by the milt 
and roe) of their common fize.
Fourthly, They are found in the fiefh waters in all 
times of the year,-!- and even at feafons when the falmon 
fry have gained a confiderable fize.
It is well known, 
that nezr ShrcvjJbury (where they are called Samfons) 
they are found in fuch quantities in the month of 5 c/)- 
tember, that a fleilful angler, in a coracle, will take with 
a fly from twelve to fixteen dozen in a day.
They fpawn in November and December, at which 
time thofe of the Severn pufli up towards the head of 
that fair river, quitting the lefler brooks, and return 
into them again when they have done.
They have a general refemblance to the trout, there- 
fore muft be defcribed comparatively.
Firft, The head is proportionably narrower, and tire 
mwith lefs than tjiat of the trout.
Secondly, Their body is deeper.
Thirdly, ^'hey feldom exceed ’ fix or feven inches in-, 
length : at moft, eight and a half.
Fourthly, The peftoral fins have generally but one 
large black fpot, though fometimes a fingle fmall one 
attends it; whereas the pecfloial fins of the trout are 
more numeroufly marked.
Fifthly, The fpurious or fat fin on the back is never 
tipped with red ; nor is the edge of tlte anal fin white.
Sixthly, The fpots on the body are fewer, and not 
fo bright.
It is alfo marked from the back to the Tides with 
fix or feven large bluifli bars ; but this is not a certain 
charafter, as the fame is fometimes found in young 
trouts 
Seventhly, The tail of the famlet is much more 
forked than that of the trout.
Thefe fiih are very frequent in the rivers of Scotland, 
where they are called Pars They are alfo common 
in the Wye, where they are known by the name of 
S'kirlings, or Lafprings.” 
To the above I fliall add, that almoft all the anglers 
In the neighbourhood of Carlifle alledge ; 
i. That- all the branlins they kill (and Immenfe 
numbers are killed every year) from the month of 
May to Augiift, though they differ in fize, are fmaft.
2i That all they kill during September and Odlo- 
ber are large, or have acquired their full fize.
What becomes of the old branlins, they afle, during 
the fpring and a confiderable part of the fummer ?
“  * It has been vulgarly imagined, that there were no othef 
than males of this fpecies.” 
f Mr. Pennant here labours under an error, for, if the wea- 
ther be mild in the month of February, and the rivers be full 
of water, all the old branlins have fpawned and retired to the 
fea, and the young ones are not excluded from the fpawn till 
the latter end of April ; there are therefore no branlins in the 
rivers during the months of March and April.

Admitting thefe to be fafts, I account for them in X The eledllon for the city of Carllfle foon’ after co»

hitherto paid but little attention to this numerous clafs, 
and are therefore unable to determine, whether there 
be many rare fpecies or not; yet, relying upon the ac-

To colledf, and arrange, in a clear, 
methodical, and fcientific manner, all the various fads, and accumulated Information which the prefent advanced 
ftate of minerological knowledge might afford, w'ould be an undertaking of no flight labour or difficulty ; and 
would of icfelf form a work of confiderable magnitude and importance.

WE are under great obligations to yOHN LOSHf 
dered us.
in this part oj the ’work.-      The Editors.
They are found garduating Into almoft every imagina- 
hie variety Indeed we believe we may fafely affert 
that in no part of this ifland will the mineralogift meet 
with a greater variety of compc jnd ftones than in 
V umberland : efpecially of that fort to which Mr.
Kirwan affixes the appellation of der'vatives ; but to 
have attempted an adequate defeription of all or mofl; 
of thefe, would have required much more time, and a 
m’jch defer application to the fubjed, than we have it 
in our power at prefent to afford it.
The cobbles we 
have been fpeaking of are found of different degrees of 
fize.
1 hey are generally enveloped In a thin whitifh 
or brownifh grey cruft, occafioned by the gradual Me- 
compofition and oxygenation of their parts, beginning 
at the fiirface ; and evidently have been fragments of 
maffes, having had their angles rounded off, apparently 
by attrition, as Dr Watfon believes, in antediluvian 
waters.
To account for this, however, in a fatisfadory 
manner, and alfo for the different fituations in which 
we find them, are difficulties, which have never yet 
been, and probably never will be completely folved.— 
To afeertain with precifion, by a feries of well direded 
experiments, the compofitlon and properties of thefe 
and other aggregated ftones would, we prefume, afford 
an interefting and valuable addition to the prefent flock 
of mIner..logical knowledge; and Ihould our hiftory, 
through the favourable leceptlon of the public, ever 
arrive at a fecond edition, we trull we ftiall be enabled 
to prefent our readers with much additional informa- 
tion of this kind, drawn from the analyfes and obfer- 
vations of a gentleman who is at prefent occupied in 
inveftigating this fubjed.
We think we cannot better 
conclude than in the words of the learned bilhop of 
Llandaff, whofe opinion of the ufefulnefs and import- 
ance of enquiries of this nature, we have the fatisfac- 
tion to find pcrfedly coinciding w'lth our ow'n.

Expeiimental inveftigatlons of this fort 
made with ability and caution, in different parts of the 
world, are the only fure foundations on which we can 
ever hope to build any probable fyftem concerning the 
formation of mountains, the antiquity of the prefent 
form of the globe, and the caufes of the viciffitudes 
which It has undergone.
It is the proper province of 
natural philofophy to explore fecondary caufes \ they 
are the Heps on which the mind of man afeeuds from 
Eai h to Heaven : for the more diftindly we appre- 
hend the number and connedion of the fecondary 
caufes operating In this little fyftem which is fiibmitted 
to o ir view, the more certainly lhall we perceive the 
iieceffity of their ultimately depending, like the links 
of Homer’s chain, on a FIRST.
