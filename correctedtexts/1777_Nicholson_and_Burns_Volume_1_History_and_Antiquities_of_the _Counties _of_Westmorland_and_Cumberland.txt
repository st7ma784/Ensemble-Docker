PREFACE 
VARIOUS collections have been made from time to time by 
inquifitive and learned men, concerning the hiftory and anti- 
quities of the Counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland, fome with 
an intention of publication, others to gratify private curiofity.
By the favour of the prefent proprietors, thefe are now collected, 
digefted, and offered to the public view: it being judged more eligible 
that the following work fhould come abroad in its prefent ftate, how- 
ever imperfect, than to wait for further information, whilft the pre- 
fent materials are perifhing.
The right reverend Dr. William Nicolson lord bifhop of Carlifle 
(whom we mention in the firft place) made a collection of materials 
towards a general hiftory of the faid two counties ; confifting of, I.
A 
topographical defcription and hiflory of the county of Cumberland.
2. A collection from books, manufcripts, and records for an hiftory of 
the bifhops, priors, deans, and chapter of Carlifle.
3. Collections for 
a monafticon of the faid diocefe.
4. Hiftory of all the rectories and 
vicarages in the diocefe of Carlifle, extracted chiefly from the regifters- 
of the feveral bifhops at Rofe.
5. Mifcellany account of the ftate of 
the churches, parfonage and vicarage houfes, and other things remark- 
able, in the feveral parifhes within the diocefe of Carlifle, taken in 
his parochial vifitation in the year 1 703.
All thefe are now at Hawkf- 
dale in the poffeffion of his nephew Jofeph Nicolfon efquire.
Tran- 
fcripts of feveral of thefe in four folio volumes, the faid learned pre- 
late caufed to be depofited in the library of the dean and chapter of 
Carlifle.
Towards the ecclefiaftical part of (o much of the two counties as 
lies within the diocefe of Cliefter, we have received affiftance from 
bifhop Gastrell's manufcript account of the faid diocefe of Chefter, 
with continuations by the late commiffary Stratford: Now in the 
polTefTion of Mr. James Collinfon of Lancafter.

ii PREFACE.
Mr. John Denton of Cardew made large extracts from the Efchea- 
tors books for Cumberland, and from the records in the Tower and 
other public offices ; containing accounts of fines levied, pleas of lands, 
inquifitions pofi mortem, grants of fairs and markets, parks, free war- 
ren, and many other particulars.
Copies of which extracts are now 
at Rydal hall, in the pofteffion of Sir Michael le Fleming baronet.
From the faid extracts Mr. Denton compiled his manufcript hiftory of 
Cumberland, which is in feveral hands.
Sir Daniel Fleming of Rydal baronet, great grandfather of the 
faid Sir Michael, made very large collections relating to both counties ; 
and from his family evidences, which have been accumulating almoft 
ever fince the conqueft, he formed a manufcript hiftory of his own 
family (and incidentally of divers other families) in two volumes 
quarto.
Amongft his other collections (befides the abovefaid copies 
from Mr. Denton) are many pedigrees of ancient families, marriage 
fettlements, inquifitions pojl mortem, extracts from the records at Lon- 
don and from the Bodleian library at Oxford, and decrees in courts 
of equity on matters arifing within the faid two counties.
He alfo 
writ a fmall manufcript hiftory of Weftmorland ; one copy whereof is 
at Rydal, and another in the faid Bodleian library.
The right honourable Anne countefs dowager of Pembroke, Dor- 
set, and Montgomery, at avaftexpence, procured from all thepublick 
offices copies of every thing that could be found relating to any of her 
anceftors the Veteriponts and Cliffords, lords of Weftmorland and he- 
reditary fheriffs of the fame ; and caufed the faid copies to be ingrafted 
in three large folio volumes, and lodged in her caftle at Appleby, where 
they now remain.
In making this collection, fhe employed that learned 
antiquary Mr. Roger Dodfworth, who left a large collection of manu- 
fcripts to the univerfity of Oxford.
From thefe records fhe caufed 
to be compiled an hiftory of her anceftors, from the firft Robert de 
Veteripont in the reign of king John, down to her own time : In the 
digefting of which memoirs fhe employed that great and learned law- 
yer Mr. Hale, afterwards lord chief juftice.
The reverend Thomas Machel, M.
A. fometime fellow of 
Queen's College in Oxford, and rector of Kirkby Thore, from his 
frrft entrance in the univerfity to the day of his death, employed him- 
felf with unwearied afliduity in collecting materials for an hiftory of 
Weftmorland ; and as his collections multiplied, an hiftory alio of 
6 Cumberland.
P R E F A C E.
Cumberland.
At his death, he left his collection to the aforefaid 
bifhop Nicolfon, with a requeft (if it might eafily be done) that his 
papers fhould be put into form and publifhed.
This collection, the 
bifhop fays in a prefatory introduction, was all in loofe papers; and 
fo imperfect and indigefted, that he could not think of compleating 
the delign.
But he gathered all the fcattered fragments together, and 
bound them up in fix volumes in folio, and lodged the fame in the 
library of the dean and chapter of Carlifle, that they might be made 
ufe of, if any perfon afterwards fhould undertake an hiftory of the 
faid two counties.
This collection of Mr. Machel confifls, fir ft, of 
extracts from the evidences at Appleby caftle and at Skipton caftle 
(another feignory belonging to the lords of Weftmorland).
Next, Mr.
Machel by himfelf, and by divers amanuenfes, made many extracts 
from the records in the Rolls chapel and in the Tower ; unto which 
he had free accefs by the friendfhip of Sir Jofeph Williamfon, fecretary 
of ftate, who had formerly been fellow of the aforefaid college.
He 
alfo made extracts from the private evidences of feveral ancient fami- 
lies ; which extracts are become more valuable, as many of the ori- 
ginals are now loft.
Mr. Machel had alfo confulted the records in the 
heralds office, and the feparate collections of feveral particular heralds, 
and efpecially of Sir William Dugdale his intimate friend.
It wasufualin 
ancient time for the heralds to perambulate the feveral counties at certain 
intervals, where they received and examined the pedigrees of the feveral 
families, approved the genuine, rejected the fpurious, and refpited the 
doubtful for further consideration, blazoned their arms, granted new 
bearings to new families, or new marks of diftinction to different 
branches of the fame ancient family.
The laft vifitation of that kind 
in Weftmorland and Cumberland was made by the fame Sir William 
Dugdale in the years 1664 and 1665 ; and Mr. Machel received copies 
from him of all the particulars.
But above all, the faid Sir William 
Dugdale had made a collection in 62 volumes in folio and quarto of 
matters relating to different parts of the kingdom.
From thence Mrâ€ž- 
Machel hath copied all that related to the faid two counties.
The reverend Hugh Todd, D.
D. vicar of Penrith and prebendary 
of Carlifle, compofed an hiftorical defcription of the diocefe of Car- 
lifle, in a large folio manufcript, and intended the fame for publica- 
tion, but was prevented by the moft obvious of all reafons, namely,, 
waiting for further materials.
Hence it hath happened, that there is 
no account in his manufcript from what fountains he derived his in- 
formation : and in fact, many of his accounts, when compared with 
a 2 the 
m 
iv P R E F A, G E.
the records of ancient times, appear to have wanted a reconfideration.
Nevcrthelefs, he was a gentleman of ability and learning, and there 
are many things in his collection both curious and inftructive.
Copies 
of this work are in feveral hands.
Sir Thomas Carle ton of Carleton hall made divers extracts from 
the public offices relating to Cumberland and Weflmorland, and writ 
large notes on fome of Mr. Denton's extracts; and particularly, there 
is a large and curious collection of letters, which he fays were found 
in the library at Carleton hall after his grandfather's death, relating to 
the Border fervice, during the time that lord Dacre was warden of the 
Weft Marches in the reign of king Edward the fixth : Which parti- 
culars make part of the valuable collection at Rydal hall.
Christopher Rawlinson of Cark hall in the county of Lan- 
cafter efquire left a large collection of manufcripts, in which are many 
particulars relating to the counties of Weflmorland and Cumberland: 
Copies of thefe alfo are at Rydal.
James Bird of Brougham efquire, who had been fteward at Apple- 
by caflle, made a collection in alphabetical order of matters relating to 
the feveral townfhips or manors in Weflmorland holden of the faid 
caftle, from the fame materials which Mr. Machel had made ufe of be- 
fore : And there are in Mr. Bird's collection fome inquifitions and 
other evidences, which had not fallen under Mr. Machel's inflection.
This Mr. Bird appears to have had a molt ample repofitory of old 
evidences ; but after the ftricteft inquiry, nothing hath been found 
now remaining, fave only the above mentioned alphabetical digeft, 
preferved from oblivion by the aforefaid Sir Daniel Fleming.
To all thefe we may add the original Chartularies of the feveral 
religious houfes of Holme Cultram, Wetheral, and Laner- 
cost ; the firft of thefe at Hawkfdale, the fecond in the library of 
the dean and chapter of Carliile, and the third at Naward caftle be- 
longing to the right honourable the earl of Carliile.
As alfo the Re- 
â–  gijiers of the feveral bifhops of Carlifle at Rofe, from the year 1 2 9$ 
to the prefent time, but with feveral intermiffions, efpecially during 
the long and dreadful conteft between the two houfes of York and 
Lancafter : Thefe ecclefiaftical Regifters are extremely ufeful even on a 
temporal account, in helping to rectify the heraldic pedigrees of an- 
cient families; for as moft of the great men were patrons of advow- 
fons, 
PREFACE.
fons, the hiflory of the incumbents helps to elucidate the fucceffion of 
their patrons.
But our greateft curiofity is a folio manufcript (at Hawkfdale) of 
Richard Bell in the reign of queen Elizabeth warden clerk of the 
Weft Marches of England over againft Scotland; which, above all 
our other materials, affords the fulleft and moft fatisfactory account 
of the ancient ftate of the Borders, and confequently of that remark- 
able and extraordinary tenure of Border fervice, with which the cuf- 
toms of every manor throughout both the counties are moft intimately 
connected.
It would be tedious to recount all the afliftances we have been fa- 
voured with from individuals : Thefe will more properly be noticed in 
tteir refpective places.

INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE 
OF THE 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
THE hiftory of the two counties of Westmorland and Cumberland 
is fo connected with the Border laws and fervice againft Scotland, that 
fome account thereof feems to be neceffary, before we come to treat of the 
particular places in each county.
Nor will it, we truft, be ufelefs ; fince it 
will exhibit to us, as it were in a mirror, the miferable ftate of our anceftors 
in thefe parts, and incline us to reflect with gratitude on the ineftimable blefiing 
of the union of the two kingdoms under one monarch and government.
And 
of this we will treat in the order following : 
Ch. I.
Of the commencement of Border fervice j with the authority and power of 
the lord warden of the Marches.
Ch. II.
Of the Border laws.
Ch. III.
Of the manner of keeping warden courts.
Ch. IV.
Of the ftate of the Borders from the reign of king Edward the fir ft to 
the reign of king Richard the fecond inclufive.
Ch. V.
Of the ftate of the Borders from the reign of king Richard the fecond 
to the reign of king Henry the eighth.
Ch. VI.
Of the ftate of the Borders during the reign of king Henry the eighth.
Ch. VII.
Of the ftate of the Borders during the reign of king Edward the 
fixth.
Ch. VIII.
Of the ftate of the Borders during the reigns of queen Mary and 
queen Elizabeth.
Ch. IX.
Of the ftate of the Borders during the reign of king James the firft.
Ch. X.
Of the ftate of the Borders from the reign of king James the firft to 
the prefent time.
CHAP- 
viii ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
CHAPTER I.
Of the commencement of Border fervice ; with the authority and power of the lord 
warden of the marches.
THERE feems to be no doubt but that the Border fervice againft the 
Scots, as diftincl: from the general military fervice throughout the kingdom, 
is as ancient as the diftribution of the feveral feigniories and manors amongft: 
the Norman adventurers by William the Conqueror or his grantee Ranulph 
de Mefchiens.
And the tenants of the feveral manors were obliged all along, 
upon firing of beacons or other warning, to attend their lord in the fervice 
of the Borders at their own expence ; which attendance might be prolonged 
for forty days.
And according to the value of their refpective tenements, 
fome were obliged to ferve on horfeback, and others on foot, with their pro- 
per accoutrements.
Hence there were- nag tenements and foot tenements â€¢, the 
owners whereof were obliged to furnifh their ftipulated number refpectively, on 
pain of forfeiting their eitate to the lord.
"Within the manor of Bewcajlle in 
particular, they feem to have been all nag tenements â€¢, for in the refervation of 
an heriot to the lord upon the death of the tenant, there is an exception of 
the riding horfe of every fuch tenant, kept by him for the lord's fervice, ac- 
cording to ancient cuftom.
But the regulation of the Borders by diftinct laws, under the rule of lords 
wardens of the marches, feems to have commenced in the reign of king 
Edward the firft of England, at the time when he affected the iovereignty 
over Scotland.
Hoftilities then became inveterate.
The Scots ill brooked a 
claim, frivolous in itfelf, and fupported by violence.
Happy indeed had it 
been for both kingdoms, if Edward, bad as his caufe was, had finally pre- 
vailed.
It would have fpared much blood, treafure, mifery, and defolation 
which enfued ; and, as experience hath at length inftruded us, inftead of two 
jealous, wrangling, contentious neighbours, diftinguifhed by no natural boun- 
dary, would nave made us many ages fooner, one great, opulent, and flourifh- 
ing kingdom.
The firft lord warden of the marches, of whom we have had any authentic 
account, was Robert de Clifford lord of Weftmorland, and hereditary fheriff of 
the fame ; of whom the countefs of Pembroke's memoirs take notice, than 
" in the 25th year of king Edward the firft, viz.
1296, the faid Roberr, 
" bring then about 23 years of age, was made the king's captain and keeper 
** of the Marches in the north towards Scotland â€¢," â€” which was the very year 
in which Edward fubdued that kingdom.
And in the 27th year of the fame 
kimr, amongft the records of writs, there is a letter of requeft from Robert 
de Clifford capt.un of the counties of Cumberland, Weftmorland, and Lan- 
caftre, to the treafurer and barons of the exchequer., defiring them to excufe 
Sir William de Molecaftre, Sir Thomas de Felton, Robert de Molecaftre, and 
Richard de Molecaftre, from appearing in the court of exchequer according 
to their fummons, by reafon of their attendance upon him, in aid and defence 
of the Marches : Dated at Lockmaben, July 4, in that yearf.

ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
\% 
'Tis true there is an account of laws made by commiffioners of both king- 
doms for the Borders, of an earlier date, namely in the year 1249, which was 
the 33 Hen. 3.
purporting to be laws of March, made and recognized by the 
fheriff of Northumberland on the part of the king of England, and the fheriff 
of Berwick and Roxbrough on the part of the king of Scotland, upon the 
oaths of 12 knights of England, and 12 knights of Scotland.
But this 
ieems to have been a manifeft forgery of the Scots ; not only becaufe the 
names neither of the kings nor of the fheriffs are fet forth (which yet affords 
fome argument of fufpicion), but chiefly becaufe Robert de Clifford is the 
firft knight mentioned on the Englifh fide ; and this was juft five and twenty 
years before Robert de Clifford was born.
Edward, it is well known, de- 
ftroyed all the public records of Scotland ; and hence it is not unaccountable, 
that the Scots (though their caufe needed no fuch helps) might contrive this 
inftrument to fliew, that before the time of Ed. r.
they treated with England 
upon equal terms, as a fovereign and independent kingdom.
The laws differ 
not much from feveral bodies of laws that followed afterwards.
The pream- 
ble to the fame runs thus : 
Anno gratis millefimo ducentefimo quadragefimo nono, ad fejium fanfforum Ti- 
' burtii et Valeriani, ad leges Marchiarum condendas et obfervandas convenerunt ad 
Marcbias, vicecomes Northumbrias ex parte domini regis Anglias, et vicecomes de 
Bervico et Roxbrugh ex parte domini regis Scotias, ad recognofcendas leges et 
confuetudines Marchiarum, per duodecim milites Anglias, et duodecim milites Scotia

ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
To the other fufpicions of forgery we may add, that not one of the names 
of the Englifn knights, except Robert de Clifford, only, is to be found (fo far 
as we can recollect) in any authentic inftrument of thofe times.
(Of the 
Scots we have not fufficient knowledge to pronounce with fo much certainty.) 
And inftead of twelve knights, as above exprelfed, here are only eleven men- 
tioned on each fide.
Note, The word March is not derived, as many have fuppofed, from the 
hoftils fituation of the place, where parties were conftantly or frequently 
Marching to and fro â€¢, but it is a genuine old Englifh word fignifying boundary.
So the Germans ufe the word Margrave, marchiarum comes, to denote the 
ppvernor of a diftridt.
So in a like fignification we ufe the word landmark.
The power of the lords wardens of the Marches was not always exactly the 
fame, but varied in different reigns according to circumltances, fome being 
more limited in their commifTions than others ; but their power in general was 
of nectffity very great.
This will belt appear from the general tenor of their 
commidion, which was as followeth : 
u Elizabeth by the grace of God of England, France, and Ireland queen, 
defender of the faith, and fo forth ; To all to whom thefe prefents (hall come, 
greeting.
Know ye, that we, of our fpecial grace, certain knowledge, and 
mere motion, fully trufting and having fpecial confidence in the fidelity, 
valour, difcretion, and provident circumfpecYion, of our trufty and well be- 
loved Henry lord Scroope of Bolton, by the advice of our council, have 
Conftituted and appointed and by thefe prefents do conflitute and appoint him 
the laid lord Scroope our keeper or warden and governor general of the Weft 
Marches of our kingdom of England againtt the parts of Scotland, and cap- 
tain of our city of Carhfle, and head fteward of all our lordfhips, manors, 
lands, and tenements within the Weft Marches aforefaid : Giving and granting 
to the faid lord Scroope full power and fpecial commandment to do and 
execute all and every thing which therein doth appertain to the office of 
warden and keeper aforefaid, as heretofore by authority as well of the lord 
Richard the fecond late king of England, as alfo of Henry the fourth, 
Henry the fifth, Henry the fixth, Edward the fourth, Richard the third, 
Henry the feventh, Henry the eighth, our mod dearly beloved brother Ed- 
ward the fixth late king of England, and our deareft filler Mary late queen 
of England, in this behalf hath reafonably been ufed and accuftomed to 
be done : 
And all and every thing, by whatfoever our lieges and fubjects, as well our 
officers as others, againft the form of whatfoever trewes between us or our 
keepers or commiflioners lawfully authorized and the comrnifTioners of Scot- 
land alfo lawfully authorized, concluded or to be concluded according to the 
form of the fame trewes, to correct, reform, and amend â€¢, and the offences in 
that behalf, according to their defervings, as well by imprifonment of then- 
bodies, as by diftrefles of their lands and tenements, goods and chattels, 
wherefoever they (hail be found, as well within liberties as without, to chaftife 
and punifh,:

CHAPTER II.
Of the Border laws.
The Border laws, agreed upon by commiflioners of both kingdoms fpe- 
cially appointed, received many alterations from time to time ; which to iet 
forth in the order as they were made, would caufe frequent repetitions, and 
would be withal perplexing-, it is therefore thought fit to reduce the fame into 
one regular uniform code as followeth.
i. The wardens yearly at the firfl day of Trewes after Midfummer, to be Wardens oath 
holden within four days at the funheft after the faid feaft, fhall (hew their of office> 
commiffions either of them to other interchangeably ; and give and receive re- 
ciprocally their folemn oath, in prefence of the inhabitants of both the Mar- 
ches, and fwear by the high God that reigneth above all kings and realms, 
and to whom all chriftians owe obedience, That he fhall, in the name of God, 
do, exercife, and ufe his office, without refpecl: of perfon, malice, favour, 
or affection, diligently and undelayedly, according to his vocation and charge 
that he beareth under God and his prince; and fhall do juftice upon all com- 
plaints preiented unto him, upon every perfon complained upon under his 
rule; and that, when any complaint is referred unto him, to fwear, fpeir, 
and deliver upon his honour, he fhall fearch, inquire, and redrefs the fame at 
his uttermoft power ; and that, if it fhall happen him in fo doing to acquit and 
abfolve the perions complained upon as clean and innocent, yet if he fhall.
any ways get fure knowledge of the very offender, he (hi all declare him foul 
of the offence, and make lawful redrefs and delivery thereof, albeit the very 
offender be not named in the complaint.
And all fuch jeifons as fhall be adjoined to the faid wardens, or be chofen 
upon any inqueit for the trying complaints, fhall make in like manner one 
folemn oath for the due execution of their duties.
2. And for prevention of fuch great enormities and mifchiefs as have fre- AHiflant 
quently undone the Borders, and difquieted the peace between the realms, cou*ciJ ro tlÂ« 
the fovereigns on either fide fhall in all humility be intreated, to chufe and wa( e " s " 
eftablifh a council in every Marche, of the molt fufficic nt and difcfeet bor- 
derers inhabiting the bounds thereof, who fhall conveen twice in the year, for 
fuch efted end ac fuch time and place, as by the particular commiflioners fhall 
be appointed unto them.
Which Border council as aforefaid, at their con- 
veenings and meetings, fhall make diligent inquiry and trial of all notorious 
thieves and robbers within their wardehry; and fuch as they find to be of that 
quality,

ately to death -, or, in cafe he be fugitive, fhall caufe him to be proclaimed

diately to be demolifhed and deftroyed, that it ferve him no more for receipt 
within that wardenry.
Murder.
3. If any fubject or fubjects of the kingdom of England do violently kill 
any fubject or fubjects of the kingdom of Scotland, the warden of the marches 
of the kingdom of England aforefaid, or his deputy or deputies, with all care 
and diligence, all fraud, favour, male-engine, and guile fet apart, fhall pro- 
fecute (and every of them fhall follow and profecute) that fuch murderer or 
murderers may be taken and brought by the wardens of both Marches or their 
deputies to the day of Trewes, to be affigned by the faid wardens ; where if 
he or they be lawfully convicted by the laws of Marche, then the warden of 
the marches of England fhall deliver or caufe to be delivered fuch murderer or 
murderers fo convicted, to the warden of the Marches of Scotland, to be 
punifhed by death.
And if it happen any fubject or fubjects of the realm of Scotland violently 
to kill any fubjtct or fubjects of the realm of England, within the Marches of 
England or the Marches of Scotland, the warden of the Marches of Scotland 
aforefaid, or his deputy or deputies, with all care and diligence, all fraud, 
favour, male engine, and guile fet apart, fhall follow (and every of them fhall 
follow and profecute) that fuch murderer and murderers may be taken, and 
that they may be brought by the wardens of both the Marches, or their de- 
puties, to the day of Trewes, by the faid wardens or their deputies to be ap- 
pointed : Where if by the laws of March he or they be lawfully convicted, 
then the warden of the Marches of Scotland fhall deliver or caufe to be de- 
livered fuch murderer or murderers as abovefaid, fo convicted, to the warden 
of England ; which warden of England, the faid murderer or murderers, fo 
as abovefaid convicted, affigned, and delivered as a murderer, fhall punifh by 
death.
And the wardens fhall do juftice therein precifely within fifteen days after 
they fhall be required thereto by their oppofites, under the pain of 10/ flerlino-, 
to be paid by the warden making default, to the party grieved, for every 
month during his delay of juftice.
Wovndlng or 4* ^ an y Â°f c ^ e fubj e & s of either realm fhall unlawfully bodily hurt or

be compelled to anfwer thereto after like manner as is ufed for robbers, thieves,

And if the party fo hurt and wounded be mutilate and maimed, the warden

Forafmuch as the inhabitants of the Marches aforefaid, with great num- 
trccs.
hers of men, have been accuftomed to cut down other mens trees, and to carry 
them away, to the ufe of their houfes, without the good- will and confent of 
the owner thereof, which hath been a matter of diffenfion and difcord upon 
the Borders â€¢, therefore to remove all occafions of contention, it is concluded, 
that no fubject of the princes aforefaid, dwelling either in the Marches afore- 
faid, or in the Debateable Ground, or in any other piace elfewhere, (hall commit 
or do fuch or the like things, or fhall content to be done or committed; nor 
fhall cut down or carry away any trees or wood whatioever, out of the Marches 
of either prince, by any means or colour, except chat he or they have co- 
venanted and agreed with the owner thereof for the fame ; and if any thing 
hath been done or committed contrary to the premiiTes, it mall be reformed ac- 
cording to the laws of Marche.
[Note, The Debateable Ground was a tract of land claimed by both king- 
doms, which was the occafion of infinite troubles and vexations.
The boun- 
dary of it in an old roll is thus defcribed : " Beginning at the foot of the

queft and of lawful proof to be ufed at the election and choice of the com- 
plainant.
And whereas in times pad there have been different forms of judgment, 
every warden having a form and manner of proceeding different from the other; 
fome redreffing the attempts with the fingle only, and fome other redreffing 
with the fingle and two doubles ; fome redreffing with a low price and value of 
goods, and other with an higher price; fome permitting the party to value and 
cfteem as well his cattle and fheep, as his other goods fpoiled, by his oath, and 
fome by the contrary ; and fo having different cuftoms at fundry Marches, which 
was altogether inconvenient ; therefore from henceforth there fhall be one uni- 
form order of juftice, according to the laudable laws and cufloms of the Marches 
heretofore ufed.
Fouling of 1 8.
All complaints fhall be inrolled by the warden of the Marche where the 
bi,ls * complainant doth inhabit; and the roll fhall be fent to the oppofite warden, 
who fhall receive the faid roll, and fhall do his uttermoft power and endeavour 
to fpeire, fearch, and inquire the truth and verity of thofe attempts contained 
in the faid complaints, and to caufe fuch perfons as be there complained upon 
to be arretted by his ferjeant to anfwer thereunto if they be prefent; and if 
they then fhall happen to be abfenr, then they are to be arretted to anfwer at 
the next day of trewes; where and when, the warden and the jury fhall either 
foul the faid bills, or give another lawful anfwer at their next meeting after the 
laws and coftoms of the Marches, whereof fix to be of the faid warden's ap- 
pointment, and the other fix to be appointed by the faid complainant, or fuch 
as purfue the bill.

And becaufe baughling and reproving at the affemb'ies of juftice be- Baughling, 
tween the laid realms giveth great occafion of trouble and inconvenience, it is 
ordered, that no perlbn of either the faid realms fhall, at any day of trewes 
or other convention or afTembly between the officers of both the faid realms, 
bear, fhew, or declare any fign or token of reproof or baughling, againft any 
fubjecl of the oppofite realm, unltfs he be thereunto fcenfed by the wardens 
of both the realms : And if any attempt, or do contrary hereunto, the of- 
fender in that behalf to be attached by the warden of the Marches, and deli- 
vered to the other warden of the oppofite Marche, to be punifhed by impri- 
fonment at his discretion by the fpace of one month; and neverthelefs the faid 
offender to forfeit and lole his caule and matter, for that he (at an inconvenient 
time) baughled and reproved, and the other party to be therefore acquitted and 
difcharged for ever.
21.
And confidering how that perjury ufed upon the Borders moft commonly Perjury,, 
is the root and ground of the hindrance and perverting of all juftice, and the 
occafion and caufe of great diforders ; it is agreed and ordered, that if any of 
the fubjects of either realm acquit himfelf by his oath taken in form of law 
before the wardens or their deputies, and after be tried and found foul and 
guilty of the fame bill whereof he fo acquitted himfelf by his oath, and there- 
upon fhall appear plainly perjured to both the faid wardens: Then, over and 
above the juft reward and recompence of the party grieved, the faid perjured 
perfon fhall be attached and taken by the warden of the Marche where he in- 
habiteth, and delivered to the warden of the oppofite realm, to be punifhed as 
a grievous offender by ftrait imprifonment during the fpace of three months; 
and at the next day of trewes, and after the faid three months ended, the faid 
offender fhall be brought before the wardens or their deputies, and there openly 
be denounced and proclaimed a perjured man; after which time, he fhall not 
be reputed to be a man able to give further faith or teftimony in any cafe or 
matter.
22.
If it fhall happen any perfon unmeafurably or outragioufly to fwear the Overfwear- 
number and value of his goods to be more and greater than of truth they in S- 
were, to the great lofs and damage of the adverfe party ; the wardens of both 
the realms, or their deputies then prefent, without any hindrance, flop, or 
delay in juftice in any wife, fhall take unto them 12 of the moft worfhipful 
and credible perfons of both realms then being prefent, whereof fix of the 
realm of Scotland to be of the denomination of the warden of England or his 
deputy then prefent, and the other fix of the realm of England to be likewiie 
at the denomination and appointment of the warden of Scotland or his deputy 
then prefent ; and the faid wardens, with their deputies and the faid twelve, 
fhall have power to moderate, diminifh, or qualify the number or price of the 
goods or cattle fo overfworn by the party above rehearfed.
23.
And becaufe it hath often happened, that the offender may be fouled in Offender re- 
bills, being delivered to the oppofite warden for the redrefs of the attempt fcuinghim- 
committed fclf *

committed by him, would make refiftance to them that lead or mould lea 
him away, and fuddenly efcape and return into his own country ; where- 
by, in fo doing, both the parties grieved lack redrefs, and trouble is raifed 
between the companies of both realms being together at days of trewes : For 
avoiding whereof, it is ordained, that the offender fo delivered fhall quietly 
pafs and remain with the party he is delivered unto, during all the time of 
their faid afTembly, and two hours after their departure; and if the faid of- 
fender (hall do the contrary hereof, he ("hall be punifhed by death or otherwife, 
at the difcretion of the wardens, as a breaker of the afiurance : And this to 
have place for offenders that are not delivered to be put to death.
â€” For fuch 
perfons as fhould be executed by death, we will that the (trait hold and keep- 
ing fhall be ufed, until juftice fhall be executed on them.
24.
If it fhall happen any of the wardens of either realm, in default of 
knowledge, to acquit any bill upon his honour in form aforefaid, which is 
indeed foul ; it fhall neverthelefs be lawful to the complainant to purfue a new 
bill a^ain, requiring juftice to be done to him for the faid attempts, upon 
better information and knowledge, unto the faid warden, or any other fucceed- 
ing in that office ; and that juftice be done to him for the faid attempts, upon 
his faid fecond complaint, by a jury and lawful proof to be had and received, 
and thereupon his bill to be fouled or acquitted after the laws and cuftoms of 
the Borders heretofore ufed, notwithftanding the fame bill was once acquitted 
by any warden upon his honour in form aforefaid.
25.
Item, It is covenanted and agreed, that if any fubject of either the 
princes aforefaid hath fuftained any robberies or fpoils by the fubjects of the 
other prince, and by his own authority hath made for the fame other robberies 
or fpoils, or taken diftreffes of men or goods in the felf fame act â€¢, he fhall lofe 
his caufe, and yet neverthelefs fhall be punifhed according to the defert of his 
trefpafs.
26.
Finally; Forafmuch as it hath appeared, by experience of time paft, 
that thieves and evil doers have not ceafed nor forborn from committing of 
offences and attempts againft the treaties of peace, albeit they were compelled 
to make redrefs by payment of the principal with two doubles; it is ordained, 
that from henceforth, if it fhall happen any of the fubjects of either realm to 
be fouled upon bills for three leveral offences and attempts to be committed 
hereafter againft the peace and amity, he (hA\ for the third fault incur the 
pain of death, as a common offender againft the laws of the Marches.
So 
that above the fatisfa&ion and redrefs of the attemptate, with the payment of 
the fingfes and two doubles to the party complainant ; the warden of the fore- 
faid offender fhall, to the uttermolt of his power, fcarch for, take, and appre- 
hend the faid 1 ffender, and bring him to the next day of Marc he, and deliver 
him to the oppofite warden to be executed to death : So that by this example, 
all other fhall take fear to offend or violate the amity between the two realms.

CHAPTER III.
Of the manner of keeping "warden courts.
A brief declaration of the fpecial heads ', orders, and forms of the laws of Marches 
of ancient time ufed upon the Borders, by the lords wardens of England and 
Scotland at their meetings and days of trewes â€¢, compofed by Richard Bell 
clerk of the Wefi Marches of England â–º 
As 
In the time of wars denounced by the princes of both realms, the lords 
wardens are to ufe both by policy, fire, and fword, or martial forces of their 
office, for to make invafion and take hoftile revenge upon and againft the 
inhabitants of either of the other's Marche reciprocally as time and occafion 
may bed afford, for the exploits of fervice tending to the honour of their 
realms and harm of their enemies: 
So 
In time of peace, by fending over their clerks, interchanging of bills con- 
taining the offences feveraily attempted, appointing and keeping of days of 
trewes, fouling of bills, and making of delivery, with all other good offices,, 
for to entertain the peaceable amity betwixt the realms to the defence and 
comfort of all true fubjects, the daunting of the infolent and difobedient under 
their rules, agreeable to the good concordance of the princes treaties of peace, 
and to the ufe and cuftom of the Borders, bills of faults are interchanged,, 
days of trewes agreed on, bills fouled and delivery of principal offenders 
made, without refpeft of perfon or furname.
Days of Marche fo appointed, proclamation is to be made, and ftraice 
letters of commandment directed in the queen's majefty's J name, for all 
lords, knights, efquires, gentlemen, and feveral officers, with convenient 
numbers of their charge and tenants (as time and fervice require) for to 
repair the night before, and give their attendance upon the lord warden unto 
the faid day of Marche, defencibly arrayed, with their beft horfes and nags, 
the morrow next following.

Which done, 
The lord warden, attended with the gentlemen, officers, fervants, and their 
powers, is to ride from the place where he inhabiteth, unto the Marche bank, 
all ftaying there without riding any further, or going over the ftream if there 
be water, or bounds if it be dry land s 
Until 
The lord warden of England firft of all (the oppofite warden known to be 
come to the place appointed) doth fend either his deputy, or fome other fpe- 
cial gentleman of good worth whom it pleafeth him for to make choice of, 
with a convenient number of the beft horfed and molt fufficient gentlemen of 
his company, unto the warden of Scotland, fignifying his repair thither, and 
craving affurance during their meeting until the fun-rifing of the next day 
following.
Which affurance being required by England and granted by Scotland ; the 
Scotch warden, holding up his hand, engages for performing thereof in all 
refpecls.
Then the deputy and other gentlemen of England, returning back to the 
lord warden of England, are to make relation of the affurance granted, and 
confent for the prefervation of the amity.
Forthwith after, 
The lord warden of Scotland fendeth his deputy, or fome other fpecial 
gentleman, accompanied with others of the beft fort of horfemen, unto the 
lord warden of England, (hewing that the lord warden of Scotland yieldeth to 
allow and confirm the affurance demanded for Scotland, craving the like for 
England ; which the warden of England, holding up his hand, granteth.
That done, 
The deputy of Scotland and his company return back to the warden of 
Scotland, declaring the granting of the affurance by England.
The lord warden of England, before he or any of his company enter into 
Scotland, caufeth proclamation to be made for observation of the peace, for 
old feeds -f- and new, word, deed, and countenance, from the time of the 
proclaiming thereof, until the next day at the fun-rifing, upon pain of death.
And 
The like proclamation, after their return forth of England, by the Scotch 
warden made before meeting.
The lord warden of England with his company entereth into Scotland, 
riding to the place where the lord warden of Scotland is, and lighting off 
horfeback (lands (till, until the Scotch warden comes to him then and there, 
in all friendly and orderly manner, mutually embracing the one the other.
After meeting and conference had between the lords wardens, they draw 
themfelves remote to fome quiet place, interchangeably calling the rolls and 
bills of both fides, in the pretence of the gentlemen of the beft forts of both 
the countries.

Whereof, 
If any doubt arife touching the fouling of the faid bills, then the fame is to 
be tried either by the lord warden's honour, or a jury of fix gentlemen of Eng- 
land and fix of Scotland, or by a vower publique f .
The oath for the jurors is, 
Tou Jhall clean no hills worthy to be fouled, you Jhall foul no bills worthy to be 
cleaned, but pall do that which appear eth with truth, for the maintenance of the 
peace, and fuppreffing of attempts : So help you God, 
The ancient oath for excufing bills : 
Tou flo all fw ear by heaven above you, hell beneath you, by your part of Paradife* 
hy all that God made in fix days and feven nights, and by God himfelf, you are 
whart out facklefs of art, part, way, witting, ridd, kenning, having, cr recetting 
of any of the goods and cattels named in this bill ; So help you God.
The oath of fwearino; of bills fouled : 
You fhall leile price make, and truth fay, what your goods were worth at the 
time of their taking to have been bought and fold in a market taken all at one time, 
and that you know no other recovery but this.
So help you God.
The lords wardens having proceeded to the calling, fouling, and making 
delivery of bills â€¢, concluding, caufe proclamation to be made by three Oyes's : 
We do you to wit, That the lords wardens of England and Scotland, and 
Scotland and England, have at this dzy of trewes well agreed, conform to 
the laudable cuftom of the law of Marche, and have made anfwer and de- 
livery, foul or clean, of all the bills inrolled.
And fo the proclamation holds 
on according to the lords wardens agreements and directions.
Proclamation made, and leave taken by the wardens in all kindly fort, they 
with their companies depart and return homeward.
Which done, 
The warden of England calleth upon the gentlemen, demanding their 
opinions and good likings of the proceedings and conference had betwixt 
him and the lord warden of Scotland that day.
Whereunto the gentlemen 
give anfwer, and their opinions.
Which done, the gentlemen take their 
leave-, the warden yielding thcrn thanks for their attendances and readinefs 
of fervice.
Thefe meetings by both wardens at the days of trewes were for the mu- 
tual redrefs of grievances between the fubjects of the one kingdom and the 
other : Next follows the order of keeping a warden's court for thâ‚¬ punilh- 
ment of offences within his own jurifdiclion :

A day of trewes for the Weft Marches was 
agreed upon by indenture between Henry Percy earl of Northumberland, and 
Archibald de Douglas lord of Calway, at the water of Efk befide S lorn to be 
holden on the 19th day of April then next following, with continuation of 
days, to take full redrefs and execution of all things done between their 
respective bounds on the Weft Marche from the 14th of October to Candle- 
mafs day then laft paft : But in communication together, it feemed ro them, 
that it would be more for the common profit of both realms, that a longer 
time of Trewes mould be appointed, and a day of Trewes appointed for the 
Eaft March likewife, if the wardens of the faid Eaft Marche mould afTent 
thereto ; they therefore came to the following agreement, that is to lay, the 
earl of Northumberland for himfelf and the lord Nevill, and the lord of Calway 
for himfelf and the earl of Douglas, that fpecial trewe and affurance fhail be 
betwixt them and their bounds, from that time to the firft day of July next 
enfuing ; and that during the faid time, none of the faid lords nor any within 
their bounds, (hall do harm to the bounds of the other parry, but they fhall 
caufe it to be redrefled as law of Marche requires.
And if it happens any 
great power of the one realm or the other to ride with hoft, each of the faii 
lords (hall do all they can to hinder it â€¢, and if they cannot hinder it, they 
(hall give warning to the other part not to be at that riding, but to hinder the 
fame as much as they can without fraud or guile.
And if the faid earl of 
Northumberland ox the lord Nevill (hall like or miQike the faid covenants, they 
or one of them (hall certify the fame by letter, on Black Monday that next 
cometh, before noon, at the chapel of Salom, by the water of EJke : And in 
the fame manner, if the faid earl Douglas or lord of Galway (hall like or 
miflike the faid covenants, they or one of them (hall certify the fame by letter, 
at the place, day, and hour aforefaid.
And in cafe thev certify that this 
agreement (land, that day that fhould have been holden on the 19th of April 
fhall be holden on the 15th of May next coming, and the day on the Eaft 
Marche fhall be holden on the 29th of the fame month of May. Alfo it is 
accorded, that all prifoners taken on both (ides (hail be freely delivered, 
and all their pledges difcharged.
And if any rlea'eth, either on one party 
or on the other, he (hall be hanged or headed.
And if any company (teal

In the 9 Ed. 4.
(1468) there is a collection of Border laws made for 
Scotland only, for the regulation of their own men in making inroads, takino- 
prifoners, and the like: But which, moft probably, mutatis mutandis, were 
alfo ufed in England â€¢, for.
we find a copy thereof in Mr. Bell's manufcripr, 
who was warden clerk as aforefaid of the Weil Marches of England.
â€” Which - 
laws are as follows : 
Be it remembered, that on the 1 8th day of December 1468, earl William 
Douglas afiembled the whole lord?, freeholders, and eldeft borderers that 
befl knowledge had, at the college of Linclouden; and there he caufed thofe 
lords and borderers bodily to be fworn, the holy gofpel touched, that they 
juftly and truly, after their cunning, fhculd decrete, decern, deliver, and 
put in order and writing, the ftatutes, ordinances, and ufes of Marche, that 
were ordained in Black Archibald of Douglas's days, and Archibald his fon's 
days, in time of warfare ; and they came again to him adviicdly with thele 
ftatutes and ordinances which were in time of warfare before.
The laid earl 
William, feeing the ftatutes in writing decreed and delivered by the faid lords 
and borderers, thought them right Ipeedful and profitable to the borderers ; 
the which ftatutes, ordinances, and points of warfare he took, and the whole 
lords and borderers he caufed bodily to be fworn, that they ihould maintain 
and fupply him, at their goodly power, to do the law upon thofe that fhould 
break the ftatutes underwritten.
Alfo the laid earl William and lords and 
eldeft borderers made certain points to be treafon in time of warfare to be 
ufed, which were no treafon before his time, but to be treafon in his time 
and in all time coming.

ing thereof, he fhall be noted as a traytor and punifhed.
And if it happens 
him to fly on that horfe, as foon as he comes home, he fhall pafs to the market

Alio it is found ftatute and ufe of Marche, that it is lawful to any man to

CHAPTER VI.
Of the Jl ate of the Borders during the reign of king Henry the eighth.
IN this king's reign there was another commifllon of Border laws and re- 
gulations â€¢, the comnnflioners were Thomas Dudley knight high chancellor of 
Engl.nd, Thomas Cromwell fecretary of ft.ite, Edward Fox aimoner, John Trey- 
movdl privy counfellor, and Richard Gixente official principal of the metropo- 
litical church of Canterbury, on the behalf of the king of England ; and 
William bifhop of Aberdeen great trealur-.r of Scot land, and Adam Ltterburne 
knight privy counfellor, on the behalf of the king of Scotl nd J.
Alfo in this king's reign, Sir Thomas Wharton (afterwards lord Wharton) 
became eminent and in high truft wiih the king as a moll: active and vigilant 
warden of the Marches.
He fiift figrialized himlelf when deputy warden of 
the Weil Marches under the lord Scroop, in the memorable rencounter at 
Sollom Mofs, of which there is fcarce a parallel in hiftory.
Being then co- 
vernor of Carlifle, he (together with Sir William Mufgrave) with 3.0 horfe- 
men [according to the common account, but from the fragments of a letter 
hereafter following they feem to have been 1400 horfe and foot] attacked an 
army of 150^0 Scot?, and with very little refinance took prifoners almoft 
every perfon of diftinclion in the Scotch army, with Yco common foldiers, and 
all their baggage and artillery.
The realon was, the Scots being dilgufted 
that Oliver Sinclair the king's favourite and an upftart was made commander 
in chief, would not fight under him.
Hillonans lay, that the Scots fled, be- 
caufe they fuppoled Wharton's men to be the van of the duke of Norfolk's 
army coming againft them.
But mofl probably, Wharton had fome private 
intimation from the Scots of what they intended â€¢, otherwife his enterprife 
would not have been courage but madnefs.
It broke the Scotch king's hearr, 
and he died within a month, leaving his infant daughter Maiy.
After the Scotch king's death, king Henry meditated a marriage between 
his Ion prince Edward and the laid Mary ; and in order to prepare the way to 
it, lent for the chief of the Scotch prifoners up to London.
And there is yec 
extant a copy of a letter from Sir 1 homas V\ harton to the king, giving an 
account of the prifoners lent up by him, with the names of their takers > and 
an original letter from die king to the laid Sir 1 homas Wharton about the 
ran lorn of laid prifoners to be given to their takers; together with a copy of 
Sir Thomas Wharton's anfwer to the fame; which are as here follows:

g 2 CHAPTER 
lii ANCIENT STATE GF THE BORDERS: 
CHAPTER VII.
Of the Jl ate of the Borders during the reign of king Edward the fixth^ 
IN the beginning of this reign, in 15*7, in the month of February in 
that year, is a manufcript account by Sir Thomas Carleton of Carleton hall of 
a forray in Scotland conducted by himfelf, who commanded a party under the 
(then) lord Wharton.
" The firft day (he fays) we made a road into Tevidale, and got a great 
booty of goods, and that night we lay in the old walls of Wawcop Tower, 
and builded to-falls ; but for lack of houfing both forourfelves and horfes, we 
could not remain there the weather was fo fore ; and fo we came to Canonby, 
where we lay a good fpace, and then went to Dumfries, and lay there, who 
fubmitted themfelves to become the king's majefty's fubjects of England.
And the morrow after my coming hither, I went into the Moot hall, and 
making a proclamation in the king of England's name, that all manner of 
men fhould come in and make oath to the king's majefty, every man at his 
peril, they all came and fwore, whereof I made a book and Tent it to the lord 
Wharton.
And I fo continued about ten days.
And fo making proclamation, 
that whofo would come in and make oath, and lay-in pledges, to ferve the 
king's majefty of England, he Ihould have our aid and maintenance, and 
who would not, we would be on them with fire and fword â€¢, many of the 
lards of Nidfdale and Galloway came in and laid-in pledges.
But the town of 
Kirkobree, being 24 miles from Dumfries, refufed : inlbmuch that the lord 
Wharton moved me, if it were poflible, with fafety, to give the fame town 
of Kirkobree a preiffe-h to burn it.
And fo we rode thither one night, and 
coming a little after fun-rifing, they who faw us coming barred their gates, 
and kept their dikes : For the town is diked on both fides, with a gate to the 
water-ward, and a gate in the over end to the fell-ward.
There we lighted 
on foot and gave the town a (harp onfet and a/fault, and flew one honeft man 
in the town with an arrow ; infomuch that one wife came to the ditch, and 
called for one that would take her hufband and fave his life.
Anthon' Arm- 
ftrong being ready faid, Fetch him to me, and I'll warrant his life.
The 
woman ran into the town, and fetched her hufband and brought him through 
the dike, and delivered him to the faid Anthon'; who brought him into Eng- 
land, and ranfomed him.
â€” The tutor of Bombye, near adjoining the faid 
town, impeached us with a company of men ; and fo we drew from the town 
and gave Bombye the onfet, where was flain of our part Clement Taylor j of 
theirs three, and divers taken, and the reft fled.
And fo we returned, feized about 2000 fheep, 200 kye and oxen, and 40 
or 50 horfes, mares, and colts, and brought the fame towards Dumfries.
The country beyond the water of Dee gathered, and came to a place called 
the Forehead ford..
So we left all our fheep, and put our worft horfed men 
f Proof, trial.
before 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
\\T\ 
before the nowte and naggs, and fent 30 of the beft horfed to preeke at the 
Scots, if they fhould come over the water, and I to abide with the ftandard in 
their relief.
Which the Scots perceiving, flayed and came not over.
So that 
we pafied quietly that night to Dumfries, leaving the goods in fafety with men 
and good watch.
In the morning we repaired to the goods, a mile beyond 
Dumfries, of intent to have divided and dealt the booty ; and fome claimed 
this cow, and fome that nagg, to be under afiurance, and ran through the 
goods.
Above all, one rmn of the laird of Empsfielde came amongft the 
goods, and would needs take one cow, faying he would be flopped by no 
man, infomuch that one Thomas Taylor, called Tom with the bow, being 
one of the garrifon, and being charged with keeping of the goods, ftruck the 
laid Scotfman on the head with his bow, fo that the blood ran down over his 
ihoulders.
Going to his mafter there, and crying out, his mafter went with him 
to the Mafter Maxwell.
The Mafter Maxwell came, with a great rout after 
him, and brought the man with the bloody head to me â€¢, faying, with an 
earneft countenance, " Is this, think ye, wele ; both to take our goods, and 
thus to fhed our blood ?" I, confidering the Mafter at that prefent to be two 
for one, thought beft to ufe him and the reft of the Scots with good words, 
and gentle and fair fpecches, for they were determined even there to have 
given us an onfet, and to have taken the goods from us, and to have made 
that their quarrel.
So that I perfuaded him and the reft to ftay themfelves â€¢â€ž 
and for the man that hurt the other man, he fhould be punifhed to the ex- 
ample of all others to commit the like, giving him that gave the ftroke fharp 
words before them â€¢, and the goods fhould all be ftayed, and none dealt, till 
the next morrow, and then every man to come that had any claim, and upon 
proof it fhould be redreffed y and thus willed every man quietly for that time 
to depart.
Upon this we all agreed, and fo we left the goods in fafe keeping, 
and came to Dumfries about- one of the clock in the afternoon, giving every 
one of the ganifon fecret warning to put on their jacks, and bridle and faddle 
their horfes, and to meet me immediately at the bridge end, and fo they did.
I fent 42 men for the goods, and to meet me at a ford a mile above the 
town, where we brought the goods over, and fo came by Lochmaben, and 
divided them that night, and brought them to Canonby where we remained 
before : And thus with wiles we beguiled the Scots." 
Afterwards, he goes on : " Confidering Canonby to be far from the enemy, 
for even at that time all Annerdale, Liddiidale, and a great part both of 
Nidfdale and Galway, were in affurance, and entred to ferve the king's ma- 
jefty of England, faving the lard of Drumlanricke, who never came in nor 
fubmitted himfelf, and with him continued Alexander Carlell'lard of Bridekirk, 
and his fon the young laird,â€” I thought it good to pradife fome way we 
might get fome hold or caftle, where we might lie near the enemy, and to lie 
within our own ftrength in the night, where we might all lie down together, 
and rife together.
Thus practifmg, one Sander Armftrong, fon to ill Will 
Armftrong, came to me and told me he had a man called John Lynton, who was 
born in the head of Annerdale, near to the Loughwood, being the laird John- 
son's chief houfe, and the faid laird and his.

T Sal fide)

Salfidc) were taken prifoners not long before, and were remaining in England.
ft was a fair large tower, able to lodge all our company fafely, with a barne- 
icin, hall, kitchen, and ftables, all within the barnekin, and was but kept 
with two or three fellows and as many wenches.
He thought it might be 
flolen in a morning at the opening of the tower door ; which I required the 
laid S.andee to practife, and as he thought good, either myfelf to go to it, or 
that he would take a company and give it a priefe, with as much forefight to 
make it fure as was poffible â€¢, for if we fhould make an offer, and not get it, 
we had loft it for ever.
At laft it was agreed that we mould go with the 
whole garrifon.
We came there about an hour before day ; and the greater part 
of us lay clofe without the barnekin : But about a dozen of the men got over the 
barnekin wall, and ftole clofe into the houfe within the barnekin, and took the 
wenches and kept them fecure in the houfe till day-light.
And at fun-rifing, two 
men and a woman being in the tower, one of the men rifing in his fhirr, and going 
to the tower head, and feeing nothing flir about, he called on the wench that Jay 
in the tower, and bad her rife and open the tower door, and call up them that 
lay beneath.
She fo doing, and opening the iron door, and a wood door 
without it, our men within the barnekin brake a little too foon to the door; 
for the wench perceiving them, leaped back into the tower, and hud gotten 
almoft the wood door to, but one got hold of it that fhe could not get it 
clofe to â€¢, fo the fkirmifh rofe, and we over the barnekin and broke open the 
wood door, and fhe being troubled with the wood door left the iron door 
cpen, and fo we entred and wan the Loghwood ; where we found truly the 
houfe well purveyed for beef falted, malt, bi_r, havermeal, butter, and cheefe.
Immediately, taking a fliort furvey of the houfe, leaving the fame in charge 
with Sandee Armftrong, and giving ftricl: command no man to imbezil or 
take away any manner of thing, until my lord Wharton's mind and pleafure 
mould be known, I rid to his lordfhip to Carlifle, who willed me in the 
king's majefty's name to keep that houfe to his grace's ufe; and to ride to 
Moffet 4 miles off, and make proclamation according to the effect of the 
proclamation made before in Dumfries â€¢, and whofo did others wrong, either 
by theft, oppreffion, or otherwife, that I fhould order it amongft them, and 
in all weighty caufes to refer it to his lordfhip and his council : which 1 ac- 
complifhed to the utmoft of my power, and fo continued there for fome time 
in the fervice of the king's majeity as captain of that houfe, governor and 
fteward of Annerdale under the lord Wharton.
In which time, we rode 
daily and nightly upon the king's majefty's enemies ; and amongft others, 
foon after our coming and remaining there, I called certain of the beft- 
horfed men of the garrifon, declaring to them I had a purpofe offered by a 
Scotfman which would be our guide, and that was, to burn Lamington, 
which we did wholly, took prifoners, and won much good both malt, fheep, 
horfe, and infight, and brought the fame to Moffet in the head of Anerdale, 
and there diftributed it, giving every man an oath to bring in all his winnings 
of that joyrney, wherein truly the men offended fo much their own 
confeience, very many layning [concealing] things which afterwards I fpeired 
out, that after that tim,e my confeience would never fuffer me to minifter an 
oath 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
iv- 
oath for this, but that which could be fpeired or known to be brought in, and' 
every man to have a fhare accordingly.
After that, I made a road in by Crawfurth caftle to the head of Clyde, 
where we fieged a great vaftil houfe of James Douglafs, which they held till 
the men and cattle were all devoured with fmoke and fire : And fo we returned 
to the Loughwood.
At which place we remained very quietly, and in a man- 
ner in as civil order both for hunting and all paftime, as if we had been at 
home in our own houfes.
For any man within Annerdale, being within 12 
or 16 miles of the Lowghwood, would have reforted to me to feek reforma- 
tion for any injury committed or done within the faid compafs, which I 
omitted not, but immediately after the plaint either rode myfelf and took the- 
pacty complained upon, or lent for him, and punifhed or redreffed, as the 
caufe deferved.
And the country- was then in good quietnefs : Annerdale, 
Nidfdale, and a great part of Galway all to the water of Dee, were come 
in and entred pledges; for then was Kirkobree come- in and entred their 
pkdges alio."

in thofe parts, they continue, and as yet the governor hath not fo great an army 
as he looked to have at this prefent time,, and therefore hath determined with 
a power to come to the town of Dumfries upon Saturday next as is appointed, 
and to levy the garrifons in all parts over againfl thefe Weft Marches, until 
they may levy a greater army to do the annoyance they may againfl: the king's 
majefty's realm and pofiefilons upon thefe Marches : Trufting, with the leave 
of God, to put the borderers in thefe outward parts of thefe Marches in 
fuch watch and areadinefs, as we (hall be able to defend their fudden enter- 
prizes â€¢, and that I would all his nujefty's fubjects under my rule fhould live 
in as much quiet and prefervation of themfelves and victual, until the occafion 
fhall come by the enemies (for intelligence whereof I (hall do fo well as I can, 
the weightinefs of this the king's majefty's fervice confidered), I require you 
to repair home to your own houfes, with hearty thanks for your arreadinefs 
and diligence, and alfo defire you in his majefty's name, to continue at your

And right heartily fare you well.
From Carlifle this Wednefday the 15th of 
June at four of the clock, afternoon, 1547.
Your loving friend 
Thomas Wharton..
Lord Wharton to the privy council^ the \6th of June 1547.
To the right honourable the lords of the king's majefty's mod ho- 
nourable privy council : 
In my lawlye and due manner, it may pleafe your moft honourable lordfhips 
to be advertifed, that upon Sunday night the 12th of June the governor and 
queen of Scots came to the town of Pebles, and no great power with them â€¢,.
the earl of Caflills and George Douglafs came with the governor, and then were 
they his chief councilors.
The fame Sunday afternoon was fet forth of Edin- 
burgh towards Pebles a demiculverin, and two facons, which came to Pebles 
upon Monday nighr.
The morrow after, it is faid, there fhall more ordnance 
come from Hamilton, whereupon I have efpial.
The governor had fent let- 
ters to the great number of noblemen and gentlemen of the eaft and weft" 
parts of Scotland byfouth the water of Forthe, and alfo for the captains of 
the garrifons had againft thefe Marches, to be afore him at Pebles the laid Sun- 
day night and Monday aforenoon.
I am informed, that the lord Hume and 
the lard of Bukclugh would not come at his commandment.
He fent again, 
the faid Monday in the morning, John Maxwell (the lord Maxwell's brother), 
the lard Drumlanrick, and young Loughenwar, and other captains of the 
X garrifons 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
Jix 
garrifons which did lie at Loughmaben and MofFet, who came to Loughmaben 
the faid Monday night.
And upon Tuefday the morrow after, had afore them 
the garrifons, and delivered the pledges to the countrymen again, and there- 
with faid that the governor would come himfelf in perfon to the town of 
-Dumfries, and bring a fufficient power with him to defend thofe countries, 
and in thofe parts would continue, until he fhould have his purpofe for their 
relief.
The governor and queen appointed to hunt on this fide Pebles the 15th 
and 16th of this inftant.
I have elpial there, to fee the manner of their hunt- 
ing.
I am informed that the queen intendeth to return homewards by Ha- 
milton ; and that the governor hath appointed to be at Moffer the 1 7th at 
night towards Dumfries.
Ancl he being in great fear to come in thofe parts, 
John Maxwell hath undertaken with others at the governor's appointment to 
watch and ward his body *.
The fame John Maxwell made great brags afore 
â€¢the governor and queen at Pebles of his truth to that realm, and his fervice 
lately (hewed againit England, (hewing his laft enterprife upon Saturday la ft, 
whereof I wrote to your lordfhips in my letters of the 12 th, where he got nei- 
ther honour nor profit, but his chief man Wattie Bell there (lain, and the 
others done as I wrote.
The earl of Angus and many others, noblemen of 
"that realm, work in all they may againft the Ling holme and thefe marches.
I truft they dare not enterprife againft the fame, or any his highnefs's poiTef 
fions, withouc the power of an army, ordnance, and munition for the fame.
The Scotfmen inhabiting upon his majefty's pofTefTlons, which ferved in thefe 
laft war.-;, continue and ferve at my commandment, notwithstanding all thefe 
great countenances of the enemy's approaching towards them.
The old lard 
of Mangerton, his fon, and of the Liddifdales and others, once or twice a 
week are with me, and feew themfelves very willing to ferve the king's ma- 
jifty, and defire that-I will appoint with them where their goods fhall be re- 
lieved, and ftand at this prefent in appearance to me very ferviceable men, and 
well deferving reward.
The poor entertainment I can make, I ufe with them.
For they have been, and yet are, continually doing difpleafure to the enemies, 
which has the more appearance to me for their fervice to be well done.
Sundry efpials fay, that they will levy their army againft Langholme and thefe 
parts; which if they do not, many the Weftmarchers of Scotland will yield 
themfelves to ferve the king's majefty at your lordfhip's moft honourable com- 
â–  mandmenr, to the great annoyance of that realm ; and that the governor and 
council know right well.
I did advertife my lords wardens of the Eaft and Middle Marches, by my 
letters of the 14th, as well of the governor and queen's coming to Pebles, as 
of the ordnance fet forth of Edinburgh, with other news as 1 had prefently 
'then; of intent the rather they might, with their own intelligence, be the 
more ready to advance the king's majefty's fervice, according to your lordikips 
â€¢ Dr Robertfon fpeaking of this governor (James Hamilton earl of A'r.n) fays Timidity and 
a-refolution were his predominant failings ; the one orcafioned by his natural conltitution, and the 
oiher arifing from a confcinufnefs that his abilities were not eqoal ro his Motion.
With thefe dii'po- 
iitions he might have enjoyed and adorned private life; but his public conduct was without courage, 
or dignity, or confidence, iiiit.

After our hearty commendations to your good lordlhip, By your letters of

and therefore we would you conformed your fole purpofe and intent of fervice

wkh the force of your wardenry (which we would were advanced to the molt

And in like manner the houfe of Carlaverok to be ufed.
During which* time 
Dumfries may be either burned or taken, as occafion lliall require.
For this 
â– we are afiured, that the thing being kept fecret, this power mall well be able 
to attempt any enterprize in all thofe parts* if it be to Douglafs; efpecially 
fince the French power, for lack of- vidual, (hall not be able to come thither 
being fo far diftant, and the country nor able to find them it.
Wherefore, 
firft of all, your lordfhip muft of neceffity give your fole ftudy hereunto, and

And for this pur-

And next this, your wardenry muft be put ia

To my lord Protector's grace, in hade, hafte, pod hade, for thy

May it pleafe your grace to be advertifed, that this prefent day I received 
your grace's letter of the 27th of September laft, whereby your grace feemeth 
not to allow mine opinion touching the affair on thefe borders, prcfentiy to 
be put in ufe againft Scotland, but declaring the ground and circumftance of 
your grace's opinion to be, that the border may and of congruence muft be 
inlarged, and that with the number of 2000 Almains to be lent hither with 
Sir Thomas Holcroft and the power of this wardenry, your grace's purpofe 
towards Loughmaben, Carlaverok, and Dumfries may be atchieved, your 
pleafure is that I (hould conform my whole purpofe and intent of office there- 
to, and that I (hall receive your grace's direction in that behalf ; willing me 
further to make provifion of victuals and ladders, and to put the power of the 
wardenry in arreadinefs ; and all this to be done in fuch manner, as the pre- 
paration thereof dilclofe not the purpofe : May it pleafe your grace to under- 
ftand, that according to my duty and charge committed unto me, my whole 
ftudy is and always hath been applied, to inlarge the borders here, and in- 
croach, and annoy the enemy; and fo according to my fimple knowledge, 
I have as well before, as in my laft letters declared to your grace, the 
mod eafy and ready way and leaft chargeable that 1 could imagine for that 
intent.
And now albeit your grace (hall in this and all other find me (for 
the advancement of the king s s majefty's honour and fervice, and the accomplifh- 
ment of your grace's direction) neither to fpare my body, lands, nor goods, 
nor the bodies of my children, kinsfolk, nor friends > yet I confider my duty

is, to open all fuch things, as either may hinder or fruftrate any your grace's 
purpofes of fervice enterprized, to the intent that the caufe may be by your 
grace's politic wifdom forefeen and provided for, and that the declaration 
thereof may be my difcharge.
Firft, As in my former letters for victuals, 
I have conferred with difcreet and expert gentlemen (not difclofing the pur- 
pofe, nor no femblable thereof), and grains be here at this inftant fo fkant, 
that wheat is preiently fold for 4.0s the quarter, malt for 26s the quarter, and 
other corns of exceffive prices, yet the foil unapt for thefe kinds of grains, it 
is not to be had in the country for money ; fo that the provifion for that pur<- 
pofe muft needs be had in fome other parts, and either tranfported hither by 
fea, or carried by land, and that with a great forefight a or elfe there fhall nei<- 
ther be fufficient for the people that be here already, nor yet the country can- 
not be able to ferve foldiers at reafonable prices as their wages (hall leave 
them : And tor this purpofe, if it fhall pleafe your grace to appoint ibme con- 
venient man to provide it where it may beft be had, he fhall have my affift- 
ance, advice and counfel as appertaineth.
Alfo, the nature of the ground and 
country is fuch, that we fhall be able to have few or none other carriages but 
only upon horfes ; and the winter is here fo fallen already, that it can be no 
worfe -, divers waters which we have to pafs having no bridges over them, fo 
that all our fpeed in that point muft hang upon fair weather.
And yet if 
thefe and divers other were put out of doubt, the country of Scotland ftanding 
as it doth at this prefent, it fhall be very like that the powers of Frenchmen and 
Scots fhall be at us before we can finifri our enterprife.
Neverthelefs, as prefl 
at commandment to all allays, if it pleafe your grace to appoint the provifion 
of grains, and other fuch victuals as be neceffary, and give order that the 
ftrangers come not hither, nor that their coming be not bruited (which is moft 
danger of revealing the enterprife), till all things may be brought in the beft 
arreadinefs that can be * I fhall in the mean time endeavour me to have the whole 
power of the wardenry (advancing as much horfemen as I can) \n arreadinefs, 
and fuch other things as I am able to do here, for the furniture of the pur- 
pofe, with as much diligence as I can ufe.
The grains that were provided 
here be utterly loft *, and will ferve for no purpofe, as the keepers thereof 
have informed me.
â€” Whereas your grace feemeth by this enterprize now at the 
abandoning of Haddington, the rather to keep credit in Scotland ; I fuppofe 
the garrifons named in my former letters mould annoy the enemy, renew 
credit, and bring the borders in fuch plight this winter feafon, that the pro- 
vifion being made ready, your grace in the fpring of the year mould bring to

this realm, about the 20th day of this month, to devaft the borders, whereby 
the king's majefty mould be unable to keep garrifons to annoy them this winter; 
and forafmuch as I am uncertain in what part they mind to attempt their en- 
.terprize, either upon your charge or mine, therefore 1 thought good to ad- 
monifh your lordfhip of the fame-, to the intent that if they (hall approach

And where my lord Protector's grace is minded of

Vol. I.
i the 
Ixvi ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
the which I doubt not your lordfhip fhall do it with much honour, fo that we 
may be well furnifhed with victual and carriages : And as I know the weft 
borders to be a ftraite country, and now in the winter-time full of moffes, 
moraffes, and waters -, I do not know how we fhall attempt the thing, unlefs 
we carry with us victual to endure the time we fhall lie without â€¢, and how fud- 
denly waters will be up, your lordfhip knoweth it beft.
And as the whole 
matter refteth upon your lordfhip's hands, fo I doubt not there fhall be a good 
provifion of victual and carriages for the fame.
For otherwife I fhall affure 
your lordfhip, having Almains and ftrangers with you, ye fhall have more 
bufinefs with them lacking their victuals and their carriages, than ye fhall have 
trouble with the enemy.
And as your lordfhip is able to proceed, fo to ad- 
vertile my lord's grace â€¢, and if ye be not able to fulfil thefe things, let the 
matter be referred to the fpring-time of the year ; and in the mean time to 
provide all things for the fame, as my lord's grace fhall think convenient.
And as 
your lordfhip is in towardnefs of the fame, I pray you that I may be advertifed 
from time to time.
For if your lorJfhip fhall be furnifhed with the neceffaries 
for the fame, I doubt not your lordfhip fhall do it and more with much honour.
Before the 20th of this inftant, your lordfhip may not look for me; becaufe 
there is a purpofe pretended by the Scots for the invading of this realm.
But 
as foon as I fee to what end their purpofe is, I fhall not fail to come unto your 
lordfhip â€¢, trufting your lordfhip will put all things in arreadinefs.
And if their 
purpofe be towards your lordfhip, I fhall not fail to be with you with an honeft 
power, left they be able to attempt any thing there.
And thus praying to God 
to fend your lordfhip good health with much honour.

never thought to attempt or procure any matter to the violation or breach of

to the glory of God and the prefervation of the common wealth, whereunto 
every good man ought to have fpecial regard ; even fo, forafmuch as I know

a band of 400 horfemen, with a power of Scotland to the number of 2000, 
came to the batable land, to a houfe of Sandie Armftrang; which houfe I had 
caufed, for fear of rafing with gunpowder, to be filled with peats and turves, 
and fire to be put to them, fo that no powder could be put to it.
And having 
no knowledge from your lordfliips, nor anfwer of my feveral letters for this 
purpofe, whereof I am much amarvelled, thejufticesof afiize being here pre - 
lent 1 could not well know what fliould belt be done, either to refill them 
with force (which feemed your pleafure in your former letters), and fo to have 
adjourned the afllzes, which fhould have been inconvenient, confidering that 
in three years before there was none affize nor gaol delivery here, and alio 
thereby to put in danger the peace lately concluded, or elfe to fuffer fuch as 
have ufed themfclves as fubjects to the king (whom by your letters I was 
commanded to defend) to be devafted.
Yet as the things ftood, thinking to 
do good both ways, I fent my fons and Sir Thomas Dacre with a company of 
horlemen and footmen with them to the Borders, commanding them without 
great occafion not to pafs the bounds of England ; and I remained in CarliQe 
with the reft of the power, ready to fet forth as 1 fliould be occafioned, and 
willed the judges to proceed to the afllzes.
And as in all my former letters to 
the lord Maxwell, I declared that 1 muft defend the king's fubjects, even fo 
5 now 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
hxv 
now I caufed my fon to fend a mefiage to him (either power looking upon the 
other) that I was amarvelled of his ufage of any fuch force, confidering the 
peace; and that the councils of both realms had not concluded any fpecial ap- 
pointment for that purpofe.
Whereupon feeing they could not rafe the houfe, 
by realbn of the fire that was put in and about it by my commandment, and 
thinking by likelihood they mould not work all their will without refinance, 
they returned without doing any harm, fave the burning of a thatched cote 
houfe that the Frenchmen burnt.
And no Englifhman had to do with them, 
either in pricking or otherwife â€¢, but they of the debatable land pricked with 
them and have taken three or four of them.
Befeeching your lordfhips, that 
as well in this for the time to come, as alfo in all fuch matters of importance 
coming upon a fuddenty, I may be anfwered and know your pleafures, with 
more expedition than I have had heretofore â€¢, otherwife I fhall be driven in 
fuch things, either to jeopard the violation of the peace (if they intend to pick 
it), or elfe the difhonour of the king's majefty and the harm of thefe his 
marches.
It (hall be moft necefiary I know your pleafures in the batableland,

For neither I will fuffer the warden 
of Scotland to anfwer for it, becaufe I will not affirm it to be Scotland ; nor 
will they on the contrary confent that it fhall be England : which unprovided

Wherein I de-

And if he fhall turn him for

And as for the debatable ground, your lordfhip hath 
been advertifed ere this, that by the laft treaty the king's highnefs is only to 
redeliver certain fbits which are already redelivered, and to rafe two other, the

A PROCLAMATION.
The 29th of Auguft, Anno Regis Edwardi fexti quarto 1550, on 
RouclifFe fands.
We do you to wit, this day it is agreed between us the lords wardens of 
the Weft Marches of England and Scotland and of Scotland and England, 
that either of them (hall fend to the other on Sunday come eight days, being 
the 7th of September next, fuch plaints as the inhabitants of either wardenrv 
have to exhibit againft the other, for any matter committed fince the laft coin- 
prehenfion of the peace â€¢, the bills of England to be fent the fame day to 
Loughmaben, and the bills of Scotland to Carlifle.
And for the ordering and 
redrefs of the fame, they have appointed Tuefday the 16th day of September, 
to meet at Loughmaben Stone, either in their own perfons, or their fufficient 
deputies.
And in the mean time, the faid lords wardens do ftrictly charge and 
command in both the princes names, all and every perfon and perfons within 
their feveral wardenries, that they obfcrve and keep the peace according to the 
faid comprehenfion.

To the right honourable and my fingular good lords, the lords of

May it pleafe your honourable lordfhips to be advertifed, that this day the 
lord Maxwell and I met at Gotewath for communication of matters requiring 
redrefs.
ANCIENT STAT2 OF THE BORDERS.
Ixxix 
redrefs.
And â€¢ forafmuch as the country had no perfect warning of the fame, 
bccaufe it was fuddenly appointed upon the requeft of the lord Maxwell, be- 
caufe he is commanded to wait upon the queen, we took order that we ftiould 
make proclamation in our feveral charges, that all fuch as had cau r e of com- 
plaint for injuries committed fmce the conclufion of the peace, fhould make 
ready and deliver their bills before Sunday the 7th of September to the faid 
wardens or their deputies : And either of us to fend them interchangeably to 
other; that the defendants may be commanded to anfwer the fame as apper- 
tained, the 1 6th day of September next, being a day appointed for redrefs of 
the fame.
Amongft which, the lord Maxwell demanded, what anfwer 1 had 
from your lordfhips for the batable land ; whereunto I made anfwer according 
to your letters to me addrefTed for that purpofe, and that I would anfwer and 
do as well for the king's majefty's fubjecls inhabiting upon the fame, as for the 
reft of this wardenry.
Which he feemed to take ftrangely, feeing that he 
would make no redrefs again to any of them.
And according to the fame, I 
have learned by a trufty fpiall of mine, that their intent is either to have the 
batable land ufed as it hath been in other times of peace, and the Cawe milns 
reftored again, or elfe to break the peace (yet ere Martinmafs).
And further 
he faith there are fix gallies come for the Scottifh queen, which have been fo 
fore driven and troubled with weather, that they were forced to call a great 
number of flaves overboard, and one of the gallies driven from the reft was 
yefterday unfeen or heard of.
At Carlifle the 29th of Auguft 1550.
Your honourable lordfhips at commandment, 
W. Dacre.
Lord Dacre to the Privy Council.
To the right honourable and my fingular good lords, the lords of the 
king's majefty's moft honourable privy council-, hafte, hafte, poft 
hafte, with all poflible diligence, hafte, hafte.
May it pleafe your honourable lordfhips to be advertifed, that yefterday, 
according to the late appointment between the lord Maxwell and me, my fon 
in my place, and John Maxwell deputy for the lord Maxwell, met at Lough- 
maben Stone to keep the day of March.
And before their meeting, accord- 
ing to the cuftom, lent for afiurance of peace interchangeably.
And whereas 
it hath been ufed in times paft, that the faid aflurance was afked and granted 
on both parts, before the lord warden of England paffed over the water-, I 
thought it meet now, for the better maintenance of the king's title and intereft 
of the debatable land to go over the water unto the fame batable, before we 
either demanded or granted any afturance-, where the fame was accompiifhed 
accordingly, and fo proceeded to the place prefixed.
Where divers bills of 
injuries were exhibited by both parties, and put to the juries to inquire upon.
And becaufe they refuled to make redrefs to Sandy Armftrang and others 
dwelling upon the batable, mine officers there prefent thought it not meet to 
grant nor take any redrefs of other bills j and fo condefcended to appoint 
another 
lxxx ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
another day, the 2d of October next, further to proceed in thofe bills already 
exhibited, and all other then as occaficn fhall require.
Wherefore 1 humbly 
befecch your lordfhips to advertife me of your pleafures in the mean time, 
whether I lhall take or give any redrefs for other bills, unlefs I may have alfo 
redrefs of the injuries committed to the inhabitants of the batable land, for 
they will grant no redrefs of the fame.
And I, on the other part, am lo per- 
fuaded by your late letters for that matter, that I determine to take nor grant 
no redrefs of the reft, unlefs I may have redrefs for the fame accordingly.
I am informed by a credible fpiall, that the French king hath written unto 
the governor of Scotland, that rather than the Scots fhall lofe any part of their 
poffeHions, or fuffer either the batable land aforefaid, or the lands called the 
Threpelan^s between Bowbent and the Ryding burne on the Eaft March, to 
be otherwife ufed than hath been in times paft, he will fpend the revenues not 
only of Scotland but alfo of the crown of France in defence of the fame; 
wherein I perceive the Scots take great courage.
And thus almighty God, &c.
At the king's majefty's caftle of Carlifle the 17th of September 1550.
Your honourable lordihips at commandment, 
W. Dacre.
The Privy Council to the lord Dacre.
To our very good lord the lord Dacre, lord warden of the Weft 
Marches for anempft Scotland ; hafte, poft hade, for thy life, 
for thy life.
After our right hearty commendations unto your good lordfhip, we have re- 
ceived your letters of the 17th of this inftant, by the which we do underftand 
the manner of your doings at the laft appointment with the lord Maxwell.
And where they refufe to make redrefs to Sandy Armftrang and others dwel- 
ling upon the debatable ground, we do like very well your anfwer therein.
And if they fhall remain of the fame mind at the next meeting, you fhall for 
anfwer fay unto them, that by the treaty between the king's majefty and the 
French king, both the debatable ground, and fuch others as be not otherwife 
lpecially provided, be and ought quietly to remain in the king's majefty's fub- 
jects poffeflion and occupation.
And forafmuch as the faid treaty was made with 
France, and the Scots only comprehended, the confideration thereof ought to be 
with France â€¢, wherein we doubt not but fuch end fhall be taken, as is agreeable 
both with the meaning of the treaty and with re.'fon, either at the coming of 
the Scottifh commifTioners, which (as we have heard) be in journey hither- 
wards, or fhortly after, in conference between the king's majefty's commif- 
fioners and the French king's: In the mean time, if they will offer injuries ro 
Armftrang or any other dwelling upon the debatable ground, ye mult and will 
defend the fame-, and if they will forbear, and do juftice to them and all 
others the king's fubjefts, then will ye likewiCe do the femblable, otherwife 
you may fay you will not.
And then if any inconvenience fhall enfue by this 
their refufal, the fault muft be imputed to them.
And this anfwer we think 
good

Jwcri

These commiflioners brought about a compromife and partition.
And on 
the 8th of March following there is a com million to the aforefaid lord Whar- 
ton and Sir Thomas Challoner on the part of the king of England, and a like 
commiffion was granted to Sir James Douglas of Drumlangrig and Richard 
Maitland of Lcthington on the part of the queen of Scotland, for the par- 
tition of the faid debatable land (in order to prevent contentions); who made 
their award Sept.
24, 155?, fetting forth, that whereas the inhabitants of the 
weftern part inclined more to be fubjects of England, and the inhabitants of 
the eaftern part inclined more to be fubjects of Scotland, they therefore award 
the weftern part of the faid debatable land to the king of England, and the 
eaftern part thereof to the queen of Scotland ; to be divided by a line drawn 
acrofs from Efk to Sark, and a fquare (lone fet up at each end with the arms 
of England on the welt thereof, and the arms of Scotland on the eaft fide.
And left the (tones by length of time or evil practice fhould be destroyed or 
removed, they defcribe the places where the ftones were to be fet, viz.
the 
Itone upon Efk to be where the courfe of that river bends at the weftern fide 
of a field called Dymmifdaill, where Dymmifdaill fyke comes in; and the 
ftone upon Sark to be at a red cliff in Kirkrigg, where alfo the water of Sark 
makes a turn *.
But after all thefe treaties of accommodation and concord, there was no 
peace to the Borders.
The inhabitants on both fides continued their ravages 
unintermittedly as before-, for they had been inured to no other kind of living.
And the queen of Scotland being gone into France, there was a fort of anarchy 
in that kingdom, by reafon of the contentions and competitions amongft the 
nobility; and the Englifh borderers no lefs availed themfelves of thofe times 
of confufion.
The aforefaid Mr. Bell hath exhibited lifts of fome hundreds 
of the Englilh fide that were complained of by the Scots for depredations 
(and, no doubt, there were as many on the other fide).
Out of the faid Mr.
Bell's lift, we fhall prefent the reader with the following fpecimen :

which was in force for ten yearr, and afterwards 
continued by an act of queen Elizabeth (with fome alterations) during queen 
Elizabeth's life : whereby, for the better habitation, reftoring, and re-edifying 
of the caftles, fortreffes, and fortelets, villages and houfes decaye"d, within 
the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, Weftmorland, and Durham,

within twenty miles of the Borders, and for the better manuring and improv- 
ing the grounds within the fame, and for the more increafe of tillage ; com- 
miffioners were to be appointed under the great feal, with power to inquire, 
what and how many caftles, fortreffes, and fortelets, villages, houfes, and 
habitations were decayed, and by whom, and by what occafions, and how 
many of them were meet to be re-edified, and what new ones were meet to 
be made, and where moft meet to be fituate, and what parts within the 
laid limits were moft apt to be inclofed and converted to tillage, and 
who were the lords, owners, or farmers of the fame, and what eftate, 
term, or intereft they had therein â€¢, and to take order for the execution of 
the premifies, by laying alfefTments, by arrefting and taking carts, oxen, or 
other inftruments neceflary, as alfo workmen and labourers, paying a com- 
petent ftipend for the fame-, and alio taking as many trees, woods, under- 
woods, quickfets, (tone, and timber, and other neceffaries, as mould be fuf- 
fkient, paying for the fame reafonable prices, according to their difcretion.
â€” 
And the faid act of queen Elizabeth recites, that the queen had been informed 
by report and certificate of her principal officers having charge of her borders, 
that the force of her faid borders both of horfemen and footmen was greatly 
decayed, and like daily to grow weaker by many occafions, and among others 
by decay and ruin of fundry the habitations of thole borders, whereby the 
number of the ancient inhabitants able for fervice had been diminiihed -, and 
part of the fame habitations, tenancies, and farms had been reduced rather 
to pafturing of cattle, than to the maintenance of men of fervice ; and that 
alfo in fome parts the tenants and inhabitants themfelves had diminiihed their 
own ftrength, by dividing their houfes and farms, which were meet only for 
one able houfholder and family, into the occupation of fundry perfons com- 
monly being their children or other kinsfolk, fo as by the fmallnefs and mean- 
nefs of the holding no one of them was able to furnifh a man for fervice; and 
alfo that divers owners and tenants had, for more gain than they could have 
of natural fubjects, letten their lands or feedings or fome part thereof to 
Scottilhmen, thereby not only weakening the ftrength of her majefty's na- 
tural fubjects, but ftrengthening foreigners : And therefore enacts, that the 
laid commiffioners mall inquire, as well by the oaths of 12 men as otherwife 
by their difcretions, what tenancies fince the 27 Hen. 8.
have been decayed, 
and not held by men able to ferve as horfemen or footmen according- to the 
ancient duties of thofe tenancies, and of the caufes of fuch decays, and of the 
wants or evil furnitures of the faid horfemen and footmen, and give order for 
the reformation thereof.
And if it fhall appear that the fault hath been in 
the lords or their officers, or in the officers or farmers of her majefty's ma- 
nors, lands, or tenements-, they fhall injoin fuch lords, or fuch her majefty's 
officers or farmers, to re-edify or repair the faid tenements and houfes of habi- 
tation, and fpecially the capital houfes and barnekins, at their own charges, 
and reftore like quantities of lands thereunto as had been occupied therewith 
in the faid 27th year of king Henry the eighth : And if they fliall find de- 
fault of furniture of the tenements with horfe, weapon, or armour, according 
to their duties ; they fhall injoin the faid lords and others to give fuch help as 
to the faid commiffioners fhall feem meer, towards the enabling of the tenants

ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
*ci 
refpecYively, to be furnifhed according to the ancient duty of fuch tenant, fo 
that thereby the faid tenant be furnifhed and able for fervice.
And if the un- 
ablenefs of the faid tenants (hall be found to have grown by their own default 
or wilfulnefs without juft occafion â€¢, the faid commiffioners fhall order the fame 
tenants to furnifti themfelves with horfe, armour, and weapon, or with ar- 
mour and weapon, according to their ancient ufage, and their utmoft reafon- 
able ability, at their own charges, without any contribution of the lords but 
at their own wills -f.
Some commiffions were granted, and inquifitions made, in purfuance of 
thefe ftatutes ; but nothing feems further effectually to have been done, to 
carry the fame into execution.
The next thing that hath occurred within this period, is, An abftract of 
the mufters of horfemen and footmen within the counties of Weftmorland and

This latter account feems to have been upon a general mufter of all between 
16 and 60.
Upon the death of the old lord Scroope, his fon was appointed to fucceed 
him in the wardenfhip of the Weftern Marches.
'Whereupon, in the year 
1593, he propofcd divers matters to be confidered of by the gentlemen of both 
counties, as followeth : 
* 5 Heads to be confidered upon and refolved, as fhall be thought mod 
commodious for the common quietnefs of thefe countries, delivered by the 
right honourable lord Scroope, lord warden of the Well Marches of England 
towards Scotland, unto the gentlemen of Cumberland and Weftmorland.
Firft, Forafmuch as it is conjectured that divers diforders grow, and infi- 
nite outrages are committed upon her majefty's good fubjecls on the frontiers, 
and more inwards in the country, as well by the remifs dealing of the officers 
and negligence of watches and watchers, as by the fervants, tenants, and de- 
penders of divers gentlemen, freeholders, and heads of furnames, on and 
near the frontier, and likewife by triftes, aUtirances, and alliances between the 
Englifli and Scots on the Borders ; which fort of people, befides their own 
filcheries, do (as it is thought) to the great opDrefiion of others, either guide 
or accompany Scotfmen in their day or night roads, for ftealth from her ma-

jetty's fubjecls, and to fhare the Engliflimens goods between them and the 
Scots ; or at lead, if they lay not the p!or, do willingly and wittingly tolerate 
and fuffer the Scots to pais and repafs by them and through their itrengths, 
for and with Engliflimens goods, without caufing of hue and cry, fray, or 
following of the thieves, in fuch fort as they are bound to do, both by the 
ftatute laws and ancient cuftom and conftitutions of the Borders, and by tho 
common curtefy of good neighbourhood they mould : In reformation whereof, 
iirft, it would be confidered and refolveJ,.
what courfe can be taken with the 
head and under officers under the lord warden's commandment, to allure the 
bringing in of any offenders within their charge, unto the lord warden at his 
lordfhip's direction of the fame/ 
Secondly, Whether it will not be convenient that the order for watches re- 
folved by the late lord Scroope, Sir John Forfter, and Sir Simon Mufgrave, 
be now again renewed, and with feverity oblerved -, namely, that whereas any 
goods fhould pafs through any of the watches, without hue and cry made by 
them of the watch, thofe laid watchers fhould anfwer the goods fo driven and 
carried throughout or within the precinct or compafs of the fame.
Thirdly, Whether it will not be very needful duly to put the ftatute for 
hues and crys in execution, in fuch fort, that whofoever fhall be proved be- 
fore the lord warden not to have rifen and followed the fray according to the 
fame law ; the fame perfon or peribns prefently to anfwer and fatisfy for the 
goods reived or taken away : and confideration to be had, how the penalty of 
the fame ftatute may belt and molt readily be levied for the relief of the party 
damnified.
Fourthly, It would fall in confideration how the marriages between the 
Englifh and the Scottifh nations in thefe frontiers may be from henceforth re- 
ftrained, and heretofore hath been enacted, though too remif.ly executed; 
and what bonds and affurance can be taken of all fuch as are already allied, 
for their demeanor towards the reft of her majefty's fubjects, and for like good 
behaviour of all their branches, fervants, and dependents.
Fifthly, It would moreover be confidered, what bonds and fecurity can be 
taken of every particular gentleman, freeholder, and head of furnames, fo to 
become anfwerable for their fervants, tenants, and followers or dependents, 
as they either bring in unco the lord warden, and upon his lordfhip's call, fuch 
fervants, tenants, followers and dependers, as have or are fufpected to have 
committed any tranfgreffion againft the Marche or common laws, for to abide 
a trial according to their demerits-, or, failing thereof, to fatisfy the party of- 
fended for his harm done by any of the abovefaid perfons fo belonging or de- 
pending unto them.
Sixthly, Becaufe the furnames of the Grames have no commander under the 
lord warden, what courfes are therefore mod meet to be taken for good order 
amongft them and their branches, as well for themfelves, as the evil-doers 
un derthem.
Laftly, How the refort of Lowlands men into the inland may beft be re- 
ftrained, feeing that under colour of their errands to gentlemen and others, 
many evil offices are effected by them in their paflages.
Thomas Scroope.
The 
xciy ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
"The anfwer and opinions of the gentlemen of Cumberland and Westmor- 
land made to the heads propounded and demanded by the right honourable 
Thomas lord Scroope of Bolton, lord warden of the Weft Marche of Eng- 
land towards Scotland.
To the firft, We think it very convenient for reformation of offenders, that 
the lord warden, upon complaint made unto him, do direct his warrant to the 
officer within whofe office fuch offenders fhall dwell and remain, to appre- 
hend and bring before the lord warden the faid offender â€¢, and where the offender 
dwelleth in fuch place wherein there is no known officer over them, that then 
the lord warden to direft his letters to the landlords of whofe lands the offend- 
ers dwell, that he the faid landlord fhall in like manner apprehend and bring the 
faid offender before the faid lord warden at the day limited in the faid letter.
And if any default be either in the faid officer or landlord in the execution of 
the faid letters, that then the faid officer or landlord to bepunifhed at the dif- 
cretion of the faid lord warden.
And if the faid offender make default of 
his appearance, either by flying from his officer or landlord, or any other con- 
temptuous courfe of himfelf ; that then it may pleafe the lord warden, of his 
authority, not only to reftrain the faid offenders or any to their ufe from the 
enjoying of the inhabitations, tenements, and goods, but alfo if there be 
any that after the faid felony do maintain and affift or recett the faid offenders, 
that his lordfhip will accordingly write for the faid offenders to their officer or 
landlord, and minifter punifhment unto them according to their deferving.
To the fecond ; As concerning keeping of watches, we all think that your 
lordfhip hath very well and effectually confidered of the fame, and do think 
it very meet that watches throughout the whole wardenry be continued.
And 
for that the place of watching by many occafions is known to be more meet for 
fome time in one place and fome time in another, and one place to be ftronger, and 
one place to be weaker, and not to continue always in one certainty ;.
therefore 
that it would pleafe your lordfhip to give charge to all juftices and gentlemen to 
meet together at fome places convenient, as well both for the one part of the 
wardenry as for the other, calling to them officers and other fome difcreet men 
to every quarter, to confider and fet down, as time now ferveth, where or in 
what place watches are moft needful to be eftablifhed, and to make a book 
thereof to be preferred to your lordfhip ; and that thereupon your lordfhip 
will make your feveral comrniffions to as many of the faid gentlemen and 
others, as your lordfhip fhall think convenient from time to time, fome in one 
place, fome in other, to fee the faid watches duly eftablifhed and continued ; 
and that if any default be certified unto your lordfhip of any of the faid 
watches, that your lordfhip would fee the fame punifhed as the cafe fhall re- 
quire.
To the third; Concerning the execution of the ftatute of hue and cry, 
commonly called in this country following the fray, We all think it meet the 
fame be duly put in execution.
And if there be any that do fail in following 
of the fame, or who wilfully will flop or refift any perfon fo following ; that 
â€¢ fuch offender be called before your lordfnip, and punifhed according to the 
offence, as heretofore hath been accuftomed by the warden.
And yet never- 
thelefs, 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
cxv 
thelefs, thofe who are offended may further feek their redrefs therein according 
to the ftatute or the common laws in that behalf provided.
To the fourth ; We think that concerning marriages commonly ufed between 
Scots and Englilh borderers, whereof your lordfhip hath moil wifely confidered 
that the fame may breed great inconveniences and hurts to England; yet ne- 
vertheless we think it meet, before your lordfhip fhall eftablifh any order there- 
againfl, that your lordfhip do know her majefly's pleafure or council's therein.
And as concerning taking of bonds of them already married, we do think it 
fit that your lordfhip not only call them, but all the reft of the principal 
headfmen of the Grames, Hetheringtons, Taylors, and other names, to enter 
bond unto your lordfhip to be of good behaviour, and to be anfwerable for 
the appearance of all fuch as they take to be under them â€¢, and if they will 
not fo do, then to commit them until fuch time as they be willing fo to do.
To the fifth ; We all think, that for all other perfons brought befo r e your 
lordfhip upon fufpicion of felony, whether they belong to any gentleman, or 
to any other, that they be fafely kept and continued, until they be either jus- 
tified of the laid offence, or otherwise bailed by the due courfe of law.
To the fixth : As your lordfhip hath confidered, that the Grames have no 
proper officer over them, as we ourfelves alfo do think, that fo long as they 
have not one fpecially appointed over them, we take it that both your lord- 
fhip as warden, and by exprefs words of your lordfhip's letters patent, fland- 
eth officer over them â€¢, and that they ought to be obedient to your lordfhip ; 
and that your lordfhip from time to time by your letters call the principal 
men before you, to anfwer for themfelves and thofe under them ; and if any 
of them make default, your lordfhip may apprehend them, according to the 
authority of your lordfhip's letters patent, and punifh as you fliall think con- 
venient.
To the feventh â€¢, We think it were good that warning by proclamation were 
given by your lordfhip, that no Scottifhman or fufpetted Border man under 
any colour do repair into Weftmorland or Cumberland above Carlifle, with- 
out your lordfhip's licence-, upon pain of punilhmeot at your lordfhip's con- 
fideration : And that every ju .ice or other officers or perfons in England do 
apprehend any fuch and bring them before your lordfhip upon the occafion of 
their repairing thither.
And that no gentleman fhall receive into his fervice 
any Scotfman or Borderman, but fuch as before his departure from his fervice 
he will make known to your lordfhip, fo as he may be anfwerable what any 
man can fay aaainfl him.

In the fame year, articles were propofed and agreed upon at Newcaftle, by

mas lord Scroope of Bolton lord warden of the Weil Marches, and of Si- 
Robert Cary knight deputy warden of the faid Weft Marches, and others.

Crames, Armfirongs, Fojiers, Bells, Nixons, Hethertons, Taylors, Roo/lidges, with

blood or otherwife, and of that number to fignify for how many he the chief 
and principal would undertake by fufficient bond or by pledge to make an- 
fwerab'e for any matter to be laid to their charge.
Which courfe his lordihip 
hath begun and entered with William Grame of Rofetrees and Rob of the Faid, 
and intendeth to proceed till his lordihip hath likewife gone through with every

And becaufe his lordihip hath not yet begun nor refolvcd upon any courfe 
again ft thofe, which the principal or chief (hall refufe to undertake to make 
anfwerable, being of their blood, dwelling on their land, ferving or depending 
upon them â€¢, it is confidered, that thefe unreafonable perfons be ient for by the 
lord warden's letter or fummons, to be delivered at the houfe where the party 
dwellet'i, or for the mod part maketh his abode or reforteth ; and if the party 
fo fummoned having habitation by himfelf fhall refufe and do not appear at 
the day and place appointed; that then at any time after, upon Hie precept 
and mandate of the lord warden, the chief lord of the manor or lordfhip where 
the tranfgreffor dwelleth fhall, with a competent number of men within his 
rule, be bound on pain of imprifonment at the warden's pleafure to repair to 
the houfe of the offender, and if the party be fled, to feize the tenement, with 
all the goods there or thereon, to her majefty's ufe, and fhall utterly expel and 
put out from the fame the wife, children, fervants, and friends of the offender, 
and fha!l reftrain him or any of them to his or their ufe, from taking or en- 
joying by any means any benefit of the faid tenement and goods belonging and 
found his at the time of the feizure thereof: And whofoever, after the fame 
feizure, fhall abet, harbour, recett, or any way relieve the faid offender-, the 
fame abbettor, harbourer, recettor, or reliever, to be apprehended and brought 
by the bailiff or other head officer before the lord warden, and fhall receive 
fuch punifhment as in cafe of acceffaries of felonies is appointed.
But if the contemptuous perfon be not fled, then the faid head officer to 
make feizure of the houfe and goods, and to apprehend and bring in fafety 
to the lord warden the offender, to anfwer his contempt.
And if the con- 
temptuous perfon have no certain place of dwelling, then the party thatgiveth 
him receipt or relief is to be charged to bring the offender within 20 days to 
the lord warden; wherein if he fail, the offender fhall be proclaimed a fugi- 
tive, and fo ufed of all men.
And whofoever at the proclamation fhall be

cafes of acceffaries of felonies are provided.
And this law likewife in all re- 
flects to be ufed again ft all felons and other malefactors whatfoever within this 
weft wardenry.
And if the bailiff or other officer appointed to this fervice 
fhall find the power under his own command infufficient to perform the fame, 
he fhall fignify his weaknefs to the warden, and require further affiftance at 
his hands ; which if he obtain not, he fhall be excufed.
And whereas within Bewcaftle and other places, the head officer challengeth 
to have the efcheat of all offenders under them, by which means the fheriff 
perceiving that the goods and chattels do go to the officer, and that himfelf 
fhall have only his labour for his travel â€¢, therefore the fheriff forbeareth to 
make an arreft and to apprehend any offenders, when he feeth that he may not 
with the party make feizure of his goods alfb ; fo is the felon referved by 
that means to do mifchief, without further punifhment than by appeafing his 
own officer with a part of the things itolen (as fome inform), the officer not 
caring how many evil men live under him, feeing that by them groweth fo 
great benefit unto him ; the remedying whereof the lord warden wholly refer- 
reth to wifer confideration.
Also, the evil men at thefe days ufe this policy, namely, to fteal goods 
from their neighbours, and indelayedly before the thief can be fpeired out, 
the felon himfelf, or fome other for him, will go to the party rieved, and will 
feek to draw him to compound for the redelivering of his own goods j fo re- 
maineth the thief unrevealed, and efcaping unpunifhed thus cunningly fyleth 
his hands with his neighbour's goods : Which courfe aifo how to reform, the 
lord warden referreth to better confideration.
Moreover, that the heathenifh cuftom of deadly feud in thefe countries 
may be avoided, a matter intolerable amongft the barbarous heathen, much 
more in chriftian civil policy; the lord warden thinketh it meet, without fa- 
vour and in greateft feverity, to punifh with death and confifcation of lands 
and goods, all fuch as fhall hereafter fo commit murder within this office ; and 
to call all thofe perfons betwixt whom feuds do now remain, and labour the tak- 
ing up of them, and whofo refufeth to come to agreement, that fuch perfons 
be caufed to do the fame by warding and binding to the good abearing.
Also, that all perfons which fhall openly fhore or threaten any other for any 
caufe whatfoever, from henceforth may be bound to good abearing, notwith- 
itanding a pecuniary punifhment laid and fet down for every fuch tranfgreffor.
Item, That no prifoner being a Scotfman, whether driven into England by 
due courfe of Marche law, or elfe taken by any Englifhman howfoever, be 
fuffered to ride abroad in the country, nor above a mile from the place where 
he is prifoner; upon the pain of imprifonment to the prifoner's keeper, for 
every time it can be proved the prifoner hath been otherwife.
Also, That no Scots felon or murderer be permitted to have any receipt or

The aforefaid Sir Robert Cary (afterwards earl of Monmouth) according 
to a laudable cuftom of many in thofc times, wrote certain memoirs of his 
own life, which in the year 1759 were from his manufcript prefented to the 
public by the right honourable John earl of Cork and Orrery.
A few ex- 
tracts of which will further fhew to us the ftate of the Borders at that time.
" Upon the death of the old lord Scroope, the queen gave the Weft war- 
denry to his fon, that had married my fifter.
He having received that office, 
came to me with great earneftnefs, and defired me to be his deputy, offering 
me that I fhould live with him in his houfe ; that he would allow me half a 
dozen men, and as many horfes, to be kept at his charge ; and his fee being 
1000 marks yearly, he would part it with me, and I fhould have the half.
This his noble offer I accepted of, and went with him to Carlifle â€¢, where I 
was no fooner come, but I entered into my office.
We had a ftiring time of 
it, and few days pafied over my head but I was on horfeback, either to 
prevent mifchief, or to take malefactors, and to bring the Border in better

quiet than it had been in times paft.
One memorable thing of God's mercy 
fhewed unto me was fuch, as I have good caufe flill to remember it.
I had private intelligence given me, that there were two Scottifh men, that 
had killed a churchman in Scotland, and were by one of the Grames relieved.
This Grame dwelt within five miles of Carlifle.
He had a pretty houfe, and 
clofe by it a flrong tower for his own defence in time of need.
About two 
o'clock in the morning I took horfe in Carlifle, and not above 25 in my 
company, thinking to furprize the houfe on a fudden.
Eefore I could fur- 
round the houfe, the two Scotts were gotten into the flrong tower, and I 
could fee a boy riding from the houfe as faft as his horfe could carry him, I 
little fufpecling what it meant.
But Thomas Carkton came to me prefently, 
and told me, that if I did not prefently prevent it, both myfelf and all my 
company would be either (lain or taken prifoners.
It was flrange to me to 
hear this language.
He then faid to me, e Do you fee that boy that rideth 
' away fo faft ?
He will be in Scotland within this half hour, and he is gone 
c to let them know, that you are here, and to what end you are come, and 
* the fmall number you have with ycu -, and that if they will make hafle, on 
' a fudden they may furprize us, and do with us what they pleafe.' Here- 
upon we took advice what was beft to be done.
We fent notice prefently to 
all parts to raife the country, and to come to us with all the fpeed they could; 
and withal we fent to Carlifle to raife the townfmen, for without foot we 
could do no good againft the tower.
There we flayed fome hours expecting 
more company ; and within fhort time after, the country came in on all fides, 
fo that we were quickly between three and four hundred horfe : And after 
fome little longer flay, the foot of Carlifle came to us, to the number of three 
or four hundred men ; whom we fet prefently at work to get up to the top of 
the tower, and to uncover the roof, and then fome twenty of them to fall 
down together, and by that means to win the tower.
The Scots feeino- their 
prefent danger offered to parley, and yielded themfelves to my mercy.
They 
had no fooner opened the iron gate, and yielded themfelves my prifoners 
but we might fee 400 horfe within a quarter of a mile coming to their refcue 
and to furprize me and my fmall company ; but of a fudden they flayed, and 
flood at gaze.
Then had I more to do than ever.
For all our borderers 
came crying with full mouths, \ Sir, give us leave to fet upon them ; for 
' thefe are they that have killed our fathers, our brothers, our uncles, and 
* our coufins â€¢, and they are come thinking to furprize you, upon weak graft 
* nags, fuch as they could get on a fudden ; and God hath put them "into 
' your hands, that we may take revenge of them for much blood that they 
* have fpilt of ours.' I defired they would be patient a while, and bethought 
myfelf if I fhould give them their wilis, there would be few or none of the 
Scots that would efcape unkilled (there were fo many deadly feuds among 
them); and therefore 1 refolved with myfelf, to give them a fair anfwer, but 
not to give them their defire.
So I told them, that if I were not there myfelf, 
they might then do what pleafed themfelves ; but being prefent, if I fhould 
give them leave, the blood that fhould be fpilt that day would lie very heavy 
upon 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
ci 
upon my confcience.
And therefore I defired them for my fake to forbear ; 
and if the Scots did not prefendy make away with all the fpeed they could 
upon my fending to them, they mould then have their wills to do what they 
pleafed.
They were ill fatisfied with my anfwer, but dur(t not difobey.
I fent 
with fpeed to the Scots, and bade them pack away with all the fpeed they 
could ; for if they flayed the meffenger's return, they mould few of them 
return to their own home.
They made no flay, but they were turned home- 
wards before the meffenger had made an end of his meffage.
Thus by God's 
mercy I efcaped a great danger, and by my means there were a great many 
mens lives faved that day." 
Afterwards, the faid Sir Robert Cary was made deputy warden of the Eaft 
Marches, under his father the lord Hunfdon.
On his entry upon that office, 
he fays.
â€” " I wrote to Sir Robert Ker, who was my oppofue warden â€¢, a 
brave, active, young man, and defired him that he would appoinc a day, 
when he and myfelf might privately meet in fome pare of the border, to 
take fome good order for quieting the borders, till my return from London,, 
which journey I was fhortly of neceffity to take.
He flayed my man all 
ni^ht, and wrote to me back, that he was glad to have the happinefs to be 
acquainted with me, and did not doubt but the country would be better 
o-overned by our good agreements.
I wrote to him on the Monday, and the 
Thurfday after he appointed the place and hour of meeting.
After he/iad filled my man with drink, and put him to bed, he and fome 
half a fcore with him got ro horfe, and came into England to a little village.
There he broke up an houfe, and took out a poor fellow, v who (he pretended) 
had done him fome wrong, and before the door cruelly murdered him, and 
fo came quietly home and went to bed.
The next morning he delivered my 
man a letter in anfwer to mine, and returned him to me.
It pleafed me well 
at the reading of his kind letter, but when I heard what a bravo he had put.
upon me, I quickly refolved what to do, which was, never to have to do with 
him, till I was righted for the great wrong he had doneme.
Upon this refolution,.
the day I mould have met with him, I took pofl, and with ail the hafle 
I could, rode to London, leaving him to attend my coming to him as was 
appointed.
There he flayed from one till five, but heard no news of me.
Finding by this, that I had neglected him, he returned home to his houfe ; 
and fo things refted (with great diflike the one of the other) till I came back v 
which was with .ail the fpeed I could, my bufinefs being ended.
The firfi 
thing I did after my return, was to afk juflicefor the wrong he had done me, 
but I could get none.
The Borderers feeing our difagreement, they thought 
the time wifhed for of them was come.
The winter being begun, there were 
roads made out of Scotland into the Eaft March, and goods were taken 
three or four times a week.
I had no other means left to quiet them, but 
flili fent out of the garrifon, horfemen of Berwick, to watch in the fitted, 
places for them ; and it was their good hap many times to light upon them, 
wiih the ftolen goods driving before chem.
They were no fooner brought 
before me, but a jury went upon them, and being found guilty, they were 
prefendy hanged: a courfe which had been feldom ufed â€¢, but I had no way to..
keep* 
cii ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS; 
keep the country quiet but to do fo.
For when the Scotch thieves found 
what a fharp courfe I took, with thofe that were found with the bloody hand, 
I had in a fhort time the country more quiet.
All this while we were but in 
jefl as it were, but now began the great quarrel between us.
There was a favourite of his, a great thief, called Geordie Bourne..
This 
gallant, with fome of his affociates, would in a bravery come-and take goods 
in the Eail Marche.
I had that night fome of the garrifon abroad.
They 
met with this Geordie and his fellows, driving of cattle before them.
The 
garrifon fet upon them, and with a fhot killed Geordie Bourne's uncle â€¢, and he 
himfelf, bravely refilling till he was fore hurt in the head, was taken.
After 
he was taken, his pride was fuch, as he afked, Who it was that durft avow 
that night's work ?
but when he heard it was the garrifon, he was then more 
quiet.
But fo powerful and awful was this Sir Robert Ker and his favourites, 
as there was not a gentleman in all the Eafl Marche that duril offend them.
Prelently after he was taken, I had moft of the gentlemen of the Marche 
come to me, and told me, that now I had the ball at my foot, and might 
bring Sir Robert Ker to what condition I pleafed ; for that this man's life was 
fo near and dear unto him, as I mould have all that my heart could defire for 
the good and quiet of the country and myfelf, if upon any condition 1 would 
give him his life.
I heard them and their reafons ; notwithstanding, I called 
a jury the next morning, and he was found guilty of marche-treafon.
Then 
they feared, that I would caufe him to be executed that afternOSn. Which 
made them come (locking to me, humbly intreating me, that I would fpare 
his life till the next day â€¢, and if Sir Robert Ker came not himfelf to me, and 
made me not fuch proffers as I could not but accept, that then I mould do 
with him what I pleafed.
And further thev told me plainly, that if I mould 
execute him before I had heard from Sir Robert Ker, they muft be forced to 
quit their houies and fly the country â€¢, for his fury would be fuch againfl me 
and the Marche I commanded, as he would ufe all his power and ftrength to 
the utter deftruction of the Eafl Marche.
They were Co earner!
with me, 
that I gave them my word he fhould not die that day.
There was poft upon 
pofl fent to Sir Robert Ker, and fome of them rode to him themfelves, to ad- 
vertife him in what danger Geordie Bourne was ; how he was condemned, and 
mould have been executed that afternoon, but by their humble fuit I gave 
them my word that he fnould not die that day ; and therefore befought him, 
that he would fend to me with all the fpeed he could to let me know, that he 
would be the next day with me, to offer me good conditions for the fafety of 
his life.
When all things were quiet, and the watch kt at night, after fupper about 
ten o'clock, I took one of my mens liveries, and put it about me, and took 
two other of my fervants with me in their liveries, and we three as the warden's 
men came to the provoft marfhal's where Bourne was," and were let into his 
* chamber.
We fate down by him, and told him, that we were defirous to fee 
him, becaufe we heard he was flout and valiant, and true to his friend ; and 
that we were forry our mafler could not be moved to fave his life.
He vo- 
luntarily of himfelf faid, that he had lived long enough to do fo much as he 
i had 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
ciii 
had done, and withal told us, that he had lain with above forty mens wives, 
what in England, what in Scotland ; and that he had killed fevtn Engiifhmen 
with his own hands: that he had fpent his whole time in whoring, drinking, 
ftealing, and taking deep revenge for flight offences.
He feemed to be very 
penitent, and much defired a minifter for the comfort of his foul.
We 
promifed him to let our mafter know his defire ; who, we knew, would pre- 
sently grant it.
We took our leaves of him, and prefently I took order that 
Mr. Selby, a very worthy honeft preacher, mould go to him, and not fur from 
him till his execution the next morning : for after I had heard his own con- 
feffion, I was refolved no conditions fhould fave his life ; and fo took order, 
that at the gates opening the next morning, he mould be carried to execution, 
which accordingly was performed.
In the fame morning I had one from Sir Robert Ker for a parley, who was 
within two miles flaying for me.
I fent him word, I would meet him where 
he pleafed, but I would firft know upon what terms and conditions.
Before 
his man was returned, he had heard, that in the morning very early Geordie 
Bourne had been executed.
Many vows he made of cruel revenge, and 
returned home full of grief and difdain ; and from that time forwards ftili.
plotted revenge.
He knew the gentlemen of the country were altogether 
facklefs, and to make open road upon the Marche would but fhew his malice, 
and lay him open to the punifhment due to fuch offences.
But his practice 
was, how to be revenged on me or fome of mine- 
It was not long after, that my brother and I had intelligence that there was 
a great match made at football, and the chief riders were to be there.
The 
place they were to meet at was Shelfey, and that day we heard it, was the 
day for the meeting.
We prefently called a council, and after much difpute 
it was concluded, that the hkelieft place he was to come to, was to kill the 
fcouts.
And it was the more fuipected, for that my brother (who was deputy 
warden before my coming to the office), for cattle ftolen out of the bounds, 
and as it were from under the walls of Berwick, being refufed juftice upon his 
complaint, or at lead delayed, fent of the garrifon into Liddefdale, and killed 
there the chief offender which had done the wrong.
Upon this conclufion, there was order taken, that both horfe and foot 
fhould lie in ambufh in divers parts of the bounds, to defend the fcouts, and 
to give a found blow to Sir Robert and his company.
Before the horfe and 
foot were fee out, with directions what to do, it was almofl dark night, and 
the gates ready to be locked.
We parted ; and I was by myielf coming to 
my houfe : God put it into my mind, that it might well be, he meant de- 
ftruction to my men that I had fent out to gather tithes for me at Nor ham \..
and their rendefvous was every night to fup and lie at an alehoufe in Norham.
I prefently caufed my page to take horfe, and to ride as fait as his horfe could 
carry him, and to command my fervants (who were in all eight) that pre- 
fently upon his coming to them they fhould all change their lodging, and go 
flraight to the caftle, there to lie that night in firaw or hay.
Some of them 
were unwilling thereto, but durfl not dilbbey ; fo all together left their ale- 
houfe, and retired to the caftle.
They had not well fettled themfelves to fleep, 
but 
civ ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
but they heard in the town a great alarm.
For Sir Robert and his company 
came ftreight to the alehoufe, broke open the doors, and made inquiry for 
my fervants.
They were anfwered, that by my command they were all in 
the caflle.
After they had fearched all the houfe, and found none, they 
feared they were betrayed, and with all the fpeed they could, made hafte home- 
wards again.
Thus God bleffed me from this bloody tragedy.
All the whole Marche expected nightly fome hurt to be done ; but God fo 
bleffed me and the government I held, as, for all Sir Robert's fury, he never 
drew drop of blood in all my Marche, neither durft his thieves trouble it 
much with Healing, for fear of hanging, if they were taken." 
Afterwards, Sir Robert Cary being advanced to the head wardenfhip of the 
Middle Marche, he came to the place of the warden's refidence at Alnwick 
Abbey : Where being arrived, he fays, " The thieves hearing of my being 
fettled there, continued ftill their wonted courfe in fpoiling the country, not 
caring much for me, nor my authority.
It was the beginning of fummer, 
when I firft entred into my office; but before that fummer was ended, they 
grew fomewhat more fearful.
For the firft: care I took was, to cleanfe the 
country of our inbred thieves, for by them mod mifchief was done.
For the 
Scotch riders were always guided by fome of them in all the fpoils they made.
God bleffed me fo well in all my defigns, as I never made journey in vain, 
but did that I went for.
Amongft other malefactors, there were two gentlemen thieves, that robbed 
and took purfes from travellers in the highways (a theft that was never heard 
of in thofe parts before).
I got them betrayed, took them, and.fent them to 
Newcaftle gaol, and there they were hanged.
I took not fo few as i6or 17 that fummer and the winter following, of 
notorious offenders, that ended their days by hanging or heading.
When I 
was warden of the Eaft Marche, I had to do but with the oppofite Marche, 
which Sir Robert Ker had ; but here I had to do with the Eaft:, Middle, and 
Well Marches of Scotland.
I had very good juftice with Sir Robert Ker and 
the laird of Farnehcrft (that had charge over the eaft" part of the Middle 
March) â€¢, but the weft part, which was Liddefdale and the W 7 eft Marche, kept 
me a great while in cumber.
The firft thing they did was the taking of 
Haltwefell, and carrying away of prifoners and all their goods.
I fent to feek 
for juftice for fo great a wrong.
The oppofite officer Tent me word, it was 
not in his power, for that they were all fugitives, and not anfwerable to the 
king's laws.
I acquainted the king of Scots with his anfwer.
He fignified to 
me that it was true, and that if I could take my own revenge without hurting 
his honeft fubjects, he would be glad of it.
I took no long time to refolve 
what to do, but fent fome two hundred horfe to the place where the principal 
outliers lived, and took and brought away all the goods they had.
The out- 
laws themfelves were in ftrong holds, and could no way be caught, But one 
of the chief of them, being of more courage than the reft, gate to horfe and 
came pricking after them, crying out and afking, What he was that durft 
avow that mighty work ?
One of the company came to him with a fpear, 
and 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
cv 
and ran him through the body, leaving his fpear broken in him, of which 
wound he died.
The goods were divided to the poor men, from whom they 
were taken before.
â€” The next fummer after, I fell into a cumberfome trou- 
ble, but it was not in the nature of thieves and malefa&ors.
There had been 
an ancient cuftom of the borderers, when they were at quiet, for the oppofite 
border to fend to the warden of the Middle Marche, to defire leave, thac 
they might come into the borders of England, and hunt with their grey- 
hounds for deer, towards the end of fummer, which was never denied them.
But towards the end of Sir John Forjler's government, when he grew very 
old and weak, they took boldnefs upon them, and without leave afking would 
come into England, and hunt at their pleafure, and flay their own time.
And when they were hunting, their fervants would come with carts, and cut down 
as much wood, as every one thought would ferve his turn, and carry it away 
to their houfes in Scotland.
Sir John's imbecility and weaknefs occafioned 
them to continue their mifdemeanor fome four or five years together, before 
he left his office.
And after my lord Eners had the office, he was 1o vexed 
and troubled with the diforders of the country, as all the time he remained 
there he had no leifure to think of fo fmall a bufinels and to redrefs it; io 
that now they began to hold it lawful to come and go at their pleafures, with- 
out leave afking.
The firft fummer I entered, they did the like.
The Arm- 
Jlrongs kept me fo on work, that I had no time to redrefs it.
But havino- 
over-maftered them, and the whole Marche being brought to a good ftay and 
quietnefs, the beginning of next fummer I wrote to Furnehnrji, the warden 
over-againft me, to defire him to acquaint the gentlemen of his Marche, that 
I was no way unwilling to hinder them of their accuftomed fports to hunt in 
England as they ever had done, but withal I would not by my default difho- 
nour the queen and myfelf, to give them more liberty than was fitting.
I 
prayed him therefore to let them know, that if they would, according to the 
ancient cuftom, fend to me for leave, they fhould have all the contentment I 
could give them â€¢, if otherwife they would continue their wonted coui fe, I 
would do my befl to hinder them.
Nothwithilanding this letter, within a month after, ihey came and hunted 
as they ufed to do, without leave-, and cut down wood, and carried it away.
I wrote again to the warden, and plainly told him, I would not fuffer one 
other affront ; but if they came again without leave, they fhould dearly 
abide it.
For all this, they would not be warned, but towards the end of the fum- 
mer they came again to their wonted fports.
I had taken order to have prefent 
word brought me; which was done.
I fent my two deputies, with all the 
fpeed they could make ; and they took along with them fuch gentlemen as 
were in their way, with my forty horfe, and about one of the clock they came 
to them and fet upon them.
Some hurt was done, but I gave efpeciaj order 
they fhould do as little hurt, and fhed as little blood, as poflibly they could.
They obferved my command, only they broke all their carts, and took a 
dozen of the principal gentlemen that were there, and brought them to me to 
Witherington where I then lay.
I made them welcome, and gave them the 
Vol. I.
o befl 
5vi ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
beft entertainment that I could.
They lay in the caflle two or three days, and 
fo I fent them home â€¢, they alluring me, that they would never hunt there 
again without leave, which they did truly perform all the time I flayed there; 
and I many times met them myfelf, and hunted with them two or three days: 
and fo we continued good neighbours ever after.
But the Scots king com- 
plained to queen Elizabeth very grievoufly of this fact.
The queen and 
council liked very well of what I had done ; but to give the king fome fatif- 
faction to content him, my two officers were committed to the bifbop of Dur- 
ham's, there to remain prifoners during her majefty's pleafure.
Within a 
fortnight I had them out again, and there was no more of this bufinefs." 
[This naturally reminds one again of the famous adventure of Chevy Chafe: 
On which, the noble editor of thefe memoirs juftly obferves, that Mr. Addi- 
fon in his celebrated criticifm on that ancient ballad (Spect.
No. 70.) miflakes 
the ground of the quarrel.
It was not any particular animofity or deadly feud 
between the two noble earls the principal actors, but was a contefl of privilege 
and jurifdiction between them refpecting their offices as lords wardens of the 
Marches.] 
The next thing that occurs in order of time is a petition of the Grames in 
Mr. Bell's manuscript, to the lord Scroope, dated Sep. 19, 1600.
To the Right honourable Thomas lord Scroope, lord warden of the 
Weft Marches of England towards Scotland : 
Righ-t Honourable, 
We her majefty's tenants and faithful fubjects, whofe names are hereunder 
written, do in all humble fort befeech your good lordfhip to fland our good 
lord r Whereas we understand that the deftruction of ourfelves and our pof- 
terity is intended, by colourable practice of fome of the gentlemen of the 
country,, whofe cunning hath drawn in a number of fimple gentlemen to join 
with them ; for preventing thereof, and to lay the preemption of their dan- 
gerous plot more open, we thought good, in difcharge of our duties, firfl to 
our lord God, next to her majefty, and laftly to your good lordfhip, fo much 
in expreffing our dutiful obedience, as we do trull either your good lordfhip 
will crave at our hands, or that we ought any way to perform.
Firfl, in fhev/ing our obedience and affection to the favouring of juflice 1 
we will fland bound unto your good lordfhip, every man particularly for him- 
felf, his children, fervants, and tenants, that if your good lordfhip have any.
caufe againfl them in time to come, they fhall be anfwerable to underlie her 
majefty's laws at the general feffions.
Secondly, v/e fhall all be ready, as becometh good fubjects, to rife and 
affift your lordfhip's officers, fervants, and all her majefty's fubjects, in follow- 
ing hue and cry, and aiding them to our uttermofl power.
Laftly, if any offence be committed within your lordfhip's Marche by any 
of Scotland, we fhall be ready to ferve your good lordfhip truly in feekino- 
revenge, 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
cvu 
revenge, not reflecting kindred or favour, but ferve our prince and our 
country, as becometh true and faithful Subjects to do.
Molt humbly craving your lordfhip's favour, in having an honourable care 
of thefe our offers, and thoroughly to confider, how cruelly our lives are 
fought, and our utter deftruction intended, by thefe gentlemen confederates 
of this new league lately erected amongft us, the like never heard of in thefe 
parts before.
What caufe we have to fear to anfwer law, how clear foever our 
caufes fhall be, God and your lordfhip may judge, when thefe gentlemen 
fit on the bench and at the gaol delivery as our judges, and are known to 
third for our bloods, and would cut our throats with their hands if they durfl, 
but only that your good lordfhip will have an honourable care in preventing 
their wicked attempts, having openly avowed our destruction, knowing us not 
to depend on any fubject but only her majefty and your good lordlhip her 
majefty's officer ; not to be drawn from our loyalty, although our lives and 
destruction is one of the firft marks they openly aim at.
We pray that the meaning may prove to her majefty's good, but fure the 
prefumption is dangerous ; 
Firft, in convening fuch a multitude together that is joined in bond and 
oath, in fuch a league as they are bound and fworn in : - 
Secondly, in joining all together to difgrace Mr. Lowther her majefty's of- 
ficer under your good lordfhip, knowing his fidelity to her majefty could not 
be withdrawn : 
Thirdly, in feeking our destructions, who they know do only depend of 
God, her majefty, and your good lordfhip her majefty's officer; 
Fourthly and laftly, in prefuming to nominate your lordfhip's deputy, 
wherein they have laid open all their practices againft Mr. Lowther, which if 
they can get obtained, then all is at their own will and pleafure, being all 
birds of one neft, and feathers of one wing; for firft having all the gentlemen 
convened together thereby to be ftrong, then to have the whole county in 
their hands in your lordfhip's abfence, thereby to have Carlifle caftle her ma- 
jefty's key in this part at their own commandment : Whether the prefumption 
is perillous or not, we refer that to your lordfhip's honourable care.
But who 
have read ftories have found, that fuch a prefumption in fuch a multitude hath 
often proved a dangerous event.
And efpecially in this cafe, Mr. Thomas 
Salkeld and Mr. William Hutton, two principal men of this new league, and not 
only themfelves but as well men of their convenors, Handing deeply affected 
many ways, both in favour, kindred, and alliance to Mr. Francis Dacre, a Â« 
man whom we do hold no good fubject to her majefty, who lieth here molt 
part within 20 miles, and fome of their friends reforting unto him -, and for 
that we do owe our faithful zeal to her majefty, in fearing the worft of their 
convenings, will ftill aggravate the gentlemen to their former purpofe.
We humbly crave, that your good lordfhip will vouchfafe that honourable 
favour, as to fend this our humble petition and offer of dutiful fervice to the 
lords of her majefty's moft honourable privy-council ; to whom, and to your 
good lordfhip, we hold ourfelves, lives, and livings.
And wherein we have 
not offered our duties in every degree, as becometh faithful and true Subjects, 
02 to 
cviii ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
to amend it in any thing we can to their lordfhips, as to your lordfhip's fdf 
fhall be thought fitting for us to do : referring our caufes, and the preventing 
of the gentlemens wicked intentions, to God and her majefty's moft honourable 
privy council and your lordfliip's felf, whom we will ferve with unfeigned 
hearts during our lives.

With the reft of our friends.
The Gentlemens anfwer to the flanderous afTertions of the Grames, Sep. 2$ r 
1600.
The Gentlemen do affirm, that the Grames and their clans, with their 
children, fervants, and tenants, are the chiefeft actors in the fpoil and decay 
of our country -, and do think that your lordfhip is fo perfuaded.
And there- 
fore they do well to remember, that it is over heavy a burden for them to be 
bound to be anfwerable for their offences done.
And fo for their three offers,, 
they are good fo far as they do extend, if they may be performed ; for better 
it is to amend hereafter, than to hold on as they have done: but of what' 
validity their bonds are, experience may declare.
The caufes wherefore they are drawn to make their offers to your lordfhip- 
are moft flanderous, and wrongfully imputed by them to the gentlemen, as 
it is well known to your honour : unlefs they account their reftraints of liberty 
from wronging her mafefty's fubjects, and yielding their obedience to authority,, 
to be the deftrucYion of them and their pofterity.
We truft, our uiages and demeanor in the country to be fuch, as no true 
man will affirm or judge, that we thirft after their blood, would cut their 
throats, or avow their destruction.
For it is far from our thoughts to imagine 
any fuch wicked practice.
But we know that thefe untrue fuggeftions came 
from Lancelot Carkton to enrage the Grames againft the gentlemen-, who, as 
party with the Grames, came to prefer the faid petition, and ufed unbecoming 
fpeeches therein before your lordihip ; a man known to be contentious, and a 
practifer of lewd actions, as in part was openly manifeft before the lord bifhop 
of Carlifle, your honour, and other juftices of peace, at a feffions, in his 
accufation againft John Mufgrave her majefty's land ferjeant of Gilfland â€¢, 
where, by Carletcn's own witnefles, thebaic!
land ferjeant was cleared, and by 
them it was upon oath confefTed, that he the faid Carkton would have fuborn- 
ed them to have depofed againft the faid land ferjeant-, which he in fome 
manner openly confefTed, to his own difgrace, if he had any refpect to his 
credit.
And now by him are thefe flanders inferted in the faid petition, and 
the whole drift thereof contrived to prevent by his untruths, fo far as he can, 
the 
ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
cix 
the good means now in hand for the reformation of the fpoils and outrages in 
our country, greatly thereby decayed ; not refpecting his neighbours harms, 
he himfelf living in fafety ; being allied to the Grames by feveral marriages of 
his kindred to them, both upon the borders of England and Scotland, and 
thereby not only protected, but imboldened to profecute his unchriftian 
devices.
They are againft themfelves in alledging, that their not anfwering to the 
law is becaufe the gentlemen' which are their judges thirft after their blood ; for 
they will not anfwer their offences done already before any judge, be he never 
fo indifferent.
And fo their refufals are in refpect of their guiltinefs of the 
offences, and not in refpedt of the judges : And this appeareth forth of their 
own offers.
Neither have they had any caufe to complain upon any gentle- 
men for any injuftice offered to any of them j and therefore their affertion is 
very weak.
For the four caufes which draw a dangerous prefumption to difquiet the 
land : 
Firft, they anfwer and do deny any unlawful joining together, or any 
joining at all, but fuch as was allowed by your lordfhip's deputy in your ab- 
fence, and confirmed by your lordfhip at your home coming.
Of which 
company fo joined together, Mr. Lowther and his fon and heir were two ; 
only done for the better repreffing of theft, then and yet commonly ufed in 
our country ; which draweth no dangerful prefumption of difquiet to the 
land, for then by their own confefllon Mr. Lowther could not have been 
drawn to it if there had been any fuch appearance.
To the fecond, they do anfwer, that the gentlemen had no intention to dif- 
grace Mr. Lozvther; but, upon his too great bearing with thieves, to the hurt 
of our country, and contrary to that which he had undertaken before in his 
joining with the gentlemen, they upon juft caufe did complain againft him: 
which hath been deliberately heard, and the truth of the whole caufes known 
to your Honour and the refidue to whom the hearing and determining thereof 
was referred.
Wherein Mr. Lowther will not think himfelf wronged, neither 
commend the Grames in alledging the doings betwixt him and the gentlemen 
as any caufe to draw any peril to the difquiet of the land.
To the third ; It is untrue, and the fame with all the refidue are frivolous : 
They feek not their lives.
To the laft : They are not fo void of difcretion, as to appoint your lord- 
fhip's deputy ; whereof they have no authority nor power.
But in regard of 
the troubles within your wardenry, which are great, the gentlemen in all true 
humblenefs have intreated your Honour to appoint a deputy for better further- 
ance to your lordfhip to redrefs the wrongs and opprefilons of our country ; 
and upon juft caufe they did commend to your lordfhip a gentleman of good 
worth and ability, well experienced, and one who fears God, generally loved, 
and thought fit for that place, with whom the gentlemen with heart and hand 
will willingly join for her mnjefty's fervice-, whereby the good of her fubjects } 
and the fafety of our country, is rather to be expected.
i And 
ex ANCIENT STATE OF THE BORDERS.
And for that the faid Carleton and the Grames do fear, that the gentleman 
fo commended as fit to be your lordfhip's deputy, if he iliould be allowed 
would look into their doings, and fomewhat reftrain their former liberty of 
offending, they labour to prevent your lordfhip of your good and honourable 
purpofe therein, by preferring that doubt before your eyes as touching Francis 
Dacres, whom the gentlemen do favour, as they alledge, who lieth within 20 
miles.
As though your lordfhip did not know the difpofition of the gentleman 
commended to your honour, or of the gentlemen who do commend htm.
This is not the firft time that the fame hath been preferred againfl the gentle- 
men, and particularly againfl fome of them, not of any danger which mio-ht 
thereby eniue to the quiet of the land, but as an help to prefer their own 
private cauies by their fuggeflings thereof.
In which their allegation, the 
gentlemen who have hitherto lived without any fufpicion of difloyalty to her 
majtfly or the (late, do think themfelves wronged, to be charged with any fa- 
vour or affe&ion towards Mr. Dacres, but as true and faithful fubjects may and 
ought to do ; and fo moft humbly defire, that your lordfhip will examine the 
faid Carleton and the Grames (who preferred this petition), of their further 
knowledge, which be thofe friends of the gentleman who reforted to Mr.
Dacres ; that if any fuch be, they may receive their punifhment therein ac- 
. cording to their deferts.
And for conclufion : As often before, fo now we humbly befeech your 
Honour, to be the means, that the Grames and the refidue of our Borderers 
may be drawn in obedience to your lordfhip's authority, and may be compelled 
to anfwer her highnefs's laws from time to time in fome reaibnable manner for 
their offences, the better to itay their common robberies and fpoils of our 
. country, whereof the Grames are not blamelefs ; and that this our anfwer may 
be fent with their petition to the lords of her majefty's mofl honourable privy 
council, if your lordfhip do think fit to fend their petition.

CHAPTER IX.
Of the Jlate of the Borders, during the reign of king James the frft.
FROM the accefTion of king James the firft, when the two kingdoms 
came to be governed by one monarch, we begin to eftimate the modern ftate 
of the borders â€¢, as matters then began to incline, though but very (lowly, 
towards a reformation.
The frrft thing king James did after his acceflion was, to publifh a procla- 
mation for union between the two kingdoms, May 19, 1603, as followeth : 
Forasmuch as the king's majefty, in his princely difpofition to juftice, 
having ever a fpecial care and regard to have repreflfed the (laughters, fpoils, 
robberies, and other enormities, which were fo frequent and common upon the 
Borders of thefe realms, and to have reduced and fettled the faid Borders unto 
a perfect obedience, to the comfort of his highnefs's peaceable fubjects, the 
courfe whereof hath been heretofore impeded by the difference of the Borders,

blefling to this whole ifland, by his majefty's lawful fucceflion to the imperial 
crown of England, not only to remove this difference, but alfo to furnifh his 
highnefs with power and force fufficient to profecute that his majefty's royal 
and worthy refolution, as his highnefs hath already begun ; intending that the 
bounds poflTefTed by thofe rebellious people, being in fertility and all other

tain difordered and wicked perfons of both Marches, enemies to peace, juftice, 
and quietnefs, pretending ignorance of his majefty's refolution for the union 
of the two realms already fettled in the hearts of all his good fubjects, and 
feeding themfelves with a finifter conceit and opinion that no fuch union (hall

preffion â€¢, whereunto they are encouraged by the receipt and harbour granted 
unto them, their wives, children, goods, and gear in the inland and peaceable 
parts of both the realms, highly to his majefty's contempt, and fruftrating 
his highnefs's commiffion granted to the effect aforefaid : And therefore his 
majefty, for the better fatis faction of all his good fubjects who may ftand in 
any doubt of the faid union, and to take away all pretence of excufe from 
wicked and turbulent perfons, hath hereby thought good to publifh and make 
known to all thofe to whofe knowledge thefe prefents fhall come, that as his 
majefty hath found in the hearts of all the beft difpofed fubjects of both the 
realms of both qualities, a mod earned: defire that the faid happy union fhouid 
be perfected, the memory of all preterite difcontentments aboliftied, and the 
inhabitants of both the realms to be the fubjects of one kingdom, fo his

parliament of both the kingdoms make the fame to be perfected.

And in the mean time, till the faid union be eftablifhed with the due folem- 
nities aforefaid, his majefty doth hereby repute, hold, and efteem, and com- 
mands all his majefty's fubjecls to repute, hold, and efteem both the two 
realms as prefently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the fubjecls of 
both the realms as one people, brethren and members of one body â€¢, and in 
regard thereof, that every one of them abftain and forbear to commit any 
kind of robbery, bloodfhed, or any other infolence or diforder, or to receive 
and harbour the performs, wives, children, or goods of the fugitives and out-

and all fuch dutiful behaviour as becometh good and loyal fubjecls : certifying 
all and every perfon who fhall do, practife, or attempt any thing to the vio-

extremity to the terror of others.
Given under our fignet at our manor of Greenwich the nineteenth of May f.
In the fame year, July 8, the king publifhed another proclamation for con- 
cord and amity between the two nations; as follows : 
We have, fince our entry into this realm of England, had fpecial care to 
make all our fubjedts know, with how equal affection we refolved to proceed 
in all things which fhould concern the fafety or honour of our kingdoms, for 
both which we know we are to make one and the felf-fame account to almighty 
God, under whom we hold all earthly things ; in which refpeft we were very 
curious to prevent at our firft coming all manner of offences or affronts which 
naturally arife between feveral nations at their firft joining in fociety and con- 
verfation â€¢, never ceafing to lay fevere commandment upon our greateft fubjecls 
that came in with us, to fupprefs any injurious actions of any their fervants or 
train, towards the meaneft fubjecl of Englifh birth, in whom from the higheft 
to the loweft we have obferved fo great love and general obedience to us and 
our commandments â€¢, and whenfoever it hath come to our ears, that any of- 
fence hath been done by any of them, we have made them know how much 
it- hath difpleafed us.
Nothwithftanding, becaufe we do hear of many infolences reported to be 
committed by our nation of Scotland to our Englifh fubjecls, with this addition 
further, that the magiftrates and juftices are thought to be remifs towards 
fuch, in doubt left the fame fhould be offenfively reported to us ; we have 
thought it convenient, as well for the fatisfaclion of the one fort, as for ad- 
monition to the other, to publifh by open fignification, that feeing it hath 
pleafed almighty God to call us to the fupreme power over both, we are purpofed 
to be an universal and equal fovereign to them both, and to adminifter juftice 
where there fhall be occafion without any worldly refpecl to either of them ; 
and therefore do hereby enjoin all lieutenants, deputy lieutenants, juftices of 
peace, and all other our officers and minifters of this kingdom, that whenfo-

ever complaint fhall be made to any of them, that breach of peace is com- 
mitted by thofc of our nation of Scotland, upon the fubjeds of England, or 
by the fubjeds of England upon thole of the nation of Scotland, in both which 
kinds we hear of many great abufes, though fometimes aggravated according 
to humour of the reporters, they mall carefully upon every complaint exa- 
mine with all indifferency the particulars of every fuch adion, and caufe 
punifhment to be inflicted upon.
the party offending, without refped of nation, 
according to the laws of this realm.
And to the end they may not doubt to proceed to the execution thereof, as 
we do hereby not only aflfure them that we will ftrengthen and maintain all 
officers and magiftrates in the execution of their offices for the prefervation of 
the public peace of this realm, fo if we fhall fee at any time that any ma- 
giftrate mail be flow to redrefs fuch grievances or punifh the offenders, we 
fhall have caufe to think that they are willing to furnifh fome caufe of fuch 
rumours, the rather to ferve for colour or caufe of further alienation, and fo 
by confcquenceof fedicion amongft our people, and an hindrance to that union 
between both ftate?, which is one of the greateft benefits that we brine with 
us to our people for their ftrength and fafety â€¢, in governng of whom, though 
we muff, ufe, as ail other princes do, the miniftry of fubordinate minifters, 
yet God almighty knoweth that in our own mind there is not a thought of 
partiality towards either of them, but an internal defire and refolution to 
afford indifferent grace and juitice to all : For demonftration whereof, we 
have been forced to publifh thus much, left the iniquity of faclious and 
unruly fpirits might blemifh the innocency and integrity of our heart towards 
all our fubjeds, whom we hold dearer than our own life.

of our reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the fix.
and thirtieth f .
In the fame year, Dec. 4.
the king iffued a proclamation refpeding the 
Grames in particular ; againft whom he feems to have had a peculiar averfion, 
the Grames having generally adhered to the Englifh intereft, and by reafon of 
their number and vicinity having been a great annoyance to his ancient fubjeds 
of Scotland : 
By the King.
Forasmuch as all our fubjeds in the north parts, who have felt the fmart 
of the fpoils and outrages done upon them at our fir It entry into this kingdom, 
by divers borderers, but fpecially by the Grames, cannot be ignorant what 
care we have had, that punifhment fhould be done upon the offenders, having 
for that purpofe to our charge maintained our forces to apprehend them and 
commiflioners to try them according to the law ; by whole travel, namely,, 
of our coufin the earl of Cumberland our lieutenant there, witn the afiifhnce 
of other commiflioners, things are brought to that point, that the offenders^

are all in our mercy, and do all (but fpecially the Grames) confefs themfelves 
jo be no meet perfons to live in thofe countries, and therefore have humbly 
befought us that they might be removed to fome other parts, where with our 
gracious favour they hope to live to become new men, and to deferve our 
mercy ; although we do confefs, we have rather inclined to this courfe of 
mercy, as a thing more agreeable to our nature, than the taking of fo much 
blood as would be fhed, if we fhould leave them to the juft cenfure of the 
law : Neverthelefs, left our good fubjects, feeing no fuch execution prefently 
follow of our faid commifiion, fhould make other conftruction thereof than is 
caufej we have thought good to make known to them, that this courfe for 
the prefent proceedeth from no alteration of our former deteftation of fuch 
injury, nor from want of care and affection to our good fubjects oppreffed by 
fuch heinous offenders, but only for lack of means to provide prefently 
for the tranfplantation of thefe Grames ellewhere, to the intent their lands may 
be inhabited by others of good and honeft converfation ; we have thought it 
not amifs, for better effecting thereof, and for eafe of the prifons, to difmifs 
the vulgar fort of them â€¢, retaining their heads and principals for pledges, not 
only to be anfwerable for their forthcoming when they fhall be called for, but 
for their good behaviour alfo in the mean ieafon.
Of all which our refolution, 
we require all perfons to take notice, and to comfort themfelves with full af- 
furance, that they mall find the effects at all times of our promifes in all 
things tending to the weal of our people.
Given at Wilton the fourth day of December in the firft year of our reign 
of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the 37th.

By the King: 
A Proclamation for the union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland.
As often as we call to mind the moft joyful and juft recognition made by 
the whole body of our realm, in the ntft feffion of our high court of parlia- 
ment, of that blefling which it hath pleafed God to referve many years in his 
providence to our perfon, and now in the fulnefs of time of his dii'pofition to 
bellow upon us, namely, the blelTed union or rather reuniting of thefe two 
mighty famous and ancient kingdoms of England and Scotland under our.
imperial crown ; fo often do we think it our 'duty to do our uttermoft en* 
deavour for the advancement and perfection of that work which is of his 
beginning, and whereof he hath given fo many palpable figns and arguments, , 
as he that fecth them not is blind, and he that impugneth them doth but en- 
deavour to feparate that which God hath put together.
For to omit thofe 
things which are evident to fenfe, that the ifle within itfelf hath almoft 
none but imaginary bounds of feparation, without but one common limit or; 
rather guard of the Ocean Tea, making the whole a little world within itfelf, 
the nations an uniformity of conftitutions both of body and mind, efpecia'lly 
in martial proceiTes, a community of language (the principal means of civil.
fociety), an unity of religion (the chiefeft band of hearty union, and the 
fnreft knot of lafting peace) ; what can be a more e.xprefs teftimony of God's 
authority of this work, than that two mighty nations, having been ever from 
their firft feparation continually in blood each againft other, mould for fo 
many years immediately before our fucceffion be at peace together, as it were 
to that end, that their memory being free from fenfe of the fmart of former 
injuries, their minds might in the time of God's appointment more willingly 
come together, that it hath pleafed him fo to difpofe that this union is not: 
inforced by conqueft and violence, nor contracted by doubtful and deceivable 
points of traduction, but naturally derived from the right and title of the 
precedent princes of both kingdoms concurring in our perfon, alike lineally 
defcended from the blood of both through the facred conjunction of wedlock, 
an union which is the work of God and nature, and whereunto the works of: 
force or policy cannot attain.
We may acid hereunto, that which we have received from thofe that be 
fkiiful -f- in the laws of this land, that immediately upon our fucceffion divers 
of the ancient laws of this realm are ipfo faEt.o expired.
As namely, that of 
Efcuage, and of the naturalization of the fubjects â€¢, and that there is a greater 
affinity and concurrence between moft of the ancient laws of both kingdoms, 
than is to be found between thofe of any other two nations : 
As namely, 
In eftates of inheritance and freehold, as fee fimple, fee tail, tenant for 
life, by curtefy, dower, and fuch like.

mation on this occasion j which the edicor of Bacon's works, vol.

fays was not uicd.
In 
MODERN STATE OF THE BORDERS.
cxxiii 
In cafes of defcents of inheritance, in tenures of lands, as of knight's fer- 
vice, focage, frankalmoin, burgage, villenage, and fuch like.
In writs and forms of procefs.
In cafes of trial by juries ; grand juries.
And laftly, in officers and minifters of juftice, as Iheriffs, coroners, and 
fuch like â€¢, which we leave to be further confidered by the commiiTioners of 
both realms.
AH which, being matter prepared only by the providence of almighty God, 
and which by human induftry could not have been fo ordered ; we and all 
our fubjects ought fir ft with all reverence to acknowledge his handy work 
therein, and to give him our moft humble thanks for the fame, and then to 
further by our endeavours that which his wifdom doth by fo many figns point 
out to be his will, whereof many particularities depending upon the determi- 
nations of the dates and parliaments of both realms, we leave them there to 
be difcuffed, according to the commifllons granted by the feveral acts of both 
parliaments ; and fome other things refting in our own imperial power, as the 
head of both, we are purpofed, towards the building of this excellent work, 
to do by ourfelf that which juftly and fafely we may by our abf >lute power 
do : And for a flrft flone of this work, whereupon the reft may be laid, feeing 
there is undoubtedly but one head to both peoples which is ourfelf, and that 
unfeignedly we have but one heart and mind to communicate equally to both 
futes, as lines iffuing from one center, our juftice, our favours, and whatfo- 
ever eife, dependeth upon the unity of our fupreme power over both, God 
having miniftred to us fo juft caufe to embrace them both with equal and 
indifferent love, inafmuch as our birth and firft part of our life hath been in 
the one, and the latter part thereof is like to be for the moft part in the other : 
we think it unreafonable that the thing which is by the work of God and 
nature fo much in effect one, (hould not be one in name, unity in name being 
fo fit a means to imprint in the hearts of people a character and memorial 
of that unity which ought to be amongft them indeed.
Wherefore we have thought good to dilcontinue the divided name of 
England and Scotland out of our royal ftyle, and do intend and refolve to 
take and aflume to us, in manner and form hereafter expreffed, the name and 
ftyle of king of Great Britain, including therein, according to the truth, the 
whole ifland, wherein no man can imagine us to be led by any humour of 
vain glory or ambition, becaufe we Ihould in that cafe rather delight in a long 
enumeration of many kingdoms and ieigniories, whereof in our inheritance 
we have plenty enough, if we thought there were glory in that kind of ftyle, 
but only that we ufe it as a figniflcation of that which in part is already done, 
and fignificant prefiguration of that which is to be done hereafter, nor that 
we covet any new affected name devifed at our pleafure, but out of undoubted 
knowledge do ufe the true and ancient name, which God and time have im- 
poied tipon this ifle, extant and received in hiftory, in all maps and charts 
wherein this ifle is defcribed, and in ordinary letters to ourfelf from divers fo- 
reign princes, warranted alfo by authentical charters, exemplifications under 
feals, and other records of great antiquity, giving us precedent for our doing,

not borrowed out of foreign nations, but from the acts of our progenitors 
kings of this realm of England both before and fince the Conqueft, havino* 
not had fo juft and great caufe as we have.
Upon all which confiderations, we do by thefe prefents, by force of our 
kingly power and prerogative, affume to ourfelf, by the clearnefs of our 
right, the name and flyle of king of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, de- 
fender of the faith, &c* as followeth in our juft and lawful title, and do 
hereby publifh, -promulge, and declare the fame, to the end that in all our 
proclamations, midlives foreign and domeftical, treaties, leagues, dedicatories, 
impreffions, and in all other caufes of like nature, the fame may be ufed and 
obferved.
And to the end the fame may be fooner and more univerfally divulged both 
at home and abroad, our will and pleafure is, that the flyle be from henceforth 
ufed upon all infcriptions upon our current monies and coins of gold and 
filver hereafter to be minted.
And for that we do not innovate or aflume to us any new thing, but de- 
clare that which is and hath been evident to all, our will and pleafure is, that 
in fuch appellations or nominations as fhall be hereafter made by force of thefe 
prefents, the fame fhall be exprefled in fuch and the fame manner and form, 
and after fuch computation, as if we had aflumed and declared the fame the 
firft day of our reign of our realm of England ; forbearing only for the pre- 
fenr, that any thing herein contained do extend to any legal proceedings, in- 
ftrument, or afTurance, until further order be taken in that behalf.

In the 4th year of the faid king's reign, the parliaments of both kingdoms 
repealed all hoftile acts that had been made in former reigns againft each 
other : And commiffioners were appointed to treat of an union ; but after 
fome progrefs, it was filently dropped by the Englifh parliament, chiefly (as 
it feemeth) from an abfurd policy of the king, in overvaluing his native 
kingdom, eftimating the fame as one third part of the whole ifland ; whereas, 
in about a century after, when fuch union actually took effect, the Scots were 
better informed, being contented that in the parliament of Great Britain they 
fhould not exceed an eleventh or twelfth part, and in the land-tax fhould bear 
fcarce a fortieth part.
All this while, outrages in the Borders continued unremitted.
Special 
commiffions were iffued again and again to try and punifh delinquents ; which

matter of more curious obfervation than any of thofe on which that learned commentator hath 
defcanted.

had been exprefled in full, it mull have run â€” of the church of England and 
alfo of Ireland in earth the fupreme head (omitting Scotland; and which, if Scotland had been 
inferred, the Scots would never have aflented to) And from this time forward, the king's ftyle 
hath moft commonly run in this abbreviated form, defender of the faith, and fo forth.

Morpitte, Patrick Chermefide of Eftnefbitt, Robert Chartrons of Amisfield, 
and Gideon Murraye of Elybank, efquires, and every of them, greeting.
Whereas by the happy union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 
fubjec~Vion and allegiance by the providence of almighty God under our impe- 
rial crown in our royal perfon, the laws or ufages of the late marches or 
borders inflituted or tolerated while they flood feparate or divided under 
feveral kings for the peace and tranquillity thereof are utterly fruftrated and 
expired, and yet many of both nations dwelling near the late borders or 
marches (of fuch force is cuftom) do continue their former godlefs, loofe, and 
difordered courfe of life -, who by the ordinary and feparate proceeding of 
either country cannot, as the neceflity of the caufe requireth, be either fo 
fpeedily brought to the knowledge of God, and to obedience to us and to 
our laws (which we chiefly defire), or fuch as will not be reclaimed fo foon 
cut off by the fword of juftice left they infect others, as by joining certain of 
our loving fubjects of both nations in one commiffion for that purpofe, 
â– whom God hath already conjoined as members of one body under one 
head : 
And forafmuch as one of the greateft caufes of their offences is hope of 
impunity â€¢, and the greateft motive of their hope is, after murders, felonies, 
riots, routs, unlawful affemblies, or other offences committed in either country, 
to efcape punifhment by flying into the other : 
And forafmuch as the faid laws and ufages of the late borders and marche.
- ?
are vanished and delete, and for that it appertaineth to our kingly office to 
care and provide that all our loyal and obedient fubjects may live in peace and 
tranquility, without fear of rapine and fpoil and danger of their lives, and 
that murderers, felons, and other delinquents may be punifhed according to 
our laws reflectively in that behalf: 
We have therefore thought good, as well to remove all occafions of ftrange- 
nefs and marks of divifions between the faid nations, as alfo to take away all 
fubterfuge and quench all the fparks of any hope of efcape from punifhment 
in fuch as fhall offend, to join together in one commiffion certain of either 
nation, for the eftablifhment and prefervation of our peace in thofe parts, and 
for the utter fuppreffing and' preventing of all fuch exorbitant offences and 
diforders, or elfe for the apprehending and fending of fuch offenders as fhall 
perfift in their wickednefs, to the country and place where they offended, to 
- receive their condign punifhment for their demerits according to law and juftice 
refpectively in that behalf.

Here next followeth " A Proclamation, July 22, 1614, for apprehending 
ie Grames returned from tranfportation." 
By the King.
I T always hath been and is our natural difpofition, and the temper of our 
government to purge our dominions of malefactors, and neverthelefs draw as 
little blood as may be, and rather to prevent offences than fuffer them to go 
on to the hurt of the innocent fubjects, and the final deftruction of the ma- 
lefactors themfelves : According to which mixture of clemency and good 
policy, we did in the firft year of our reign proceed againft the Grames, 
being the principal and moft violent difturbers of the peace and quiet of the 
middle mires.
For notwithftanding that numbers, by barbarous fpoils, 
(laughters, and outrages were fallen under the fword of our juftice to be 
capitally inflicted upon them â€¢, yet we were pleafed to extend mercy unto 
them, and upon their own fuit and humble proitrating of themfelves by fub- 
miffion, to remove them and tranfplant them into our realm of Ireland, there 
to become new men, and to put off their wicked and defperate courfe of life 
formerly continued in blood and rapine.
For which purpofe we did at that 
time publifh our royal proclamation, and alfo direct our commiflion, for the 
effecting of the fame â€¢, which, not without the great charge of us and the 
country thereabouts in their (hipping and removing, was executed accord- 
ingly.
But now being given to underftand, that divers of them are of late 
returned into the (aid middle (hire, and begin to revive their old courfes of 
robbing, riding armed, and other heinous diforders, to the great terror of our 
loving iubjects there inhabiting, and to the maniftft contempt of our former 
grace and mercy, and to the renewing of former troubles and dangers ia 
thofe parts, which at this time by our politick and peaceable government 
enj:y equal benefit of peace and fecurity with the reft of our counties.
We do therefore hereby ftrictly forbid, That none of the faid Grames 
hereafter do prefume to return into our realms of England or Scotland, out 
of Irelend, or the cautionary towns of the Low Countries whereunto fome of 
them are fent, and are fince returned into Ireland, without the fpecial licence 
of out deputy of Ireland for the time being, which licence we intend to be 
according to fuch directions, and with fuch cautions, as we have already pre- 
fcribed unto our faid deputy.
And further we do, in like ftrict manner command and ordain, that if any 
of them (hall be taken within thefe middle (hires within the fpace of 40 days

ceeded with, as well upon any their former crimes, as upon the contempt of 
this our royal commandment, according to the uttermoft feventy of our law, 
and according to the directions formerly given by us and our council for the 
government of thofe parts ; and that as well our right trufty and right well

Jloughs, modes, and bogs, that were not paffable but by thofe who were ac- 
quainted with the various and intricate by-paths and turnings.

called blood hounds ; which were kept in ufe till within the memory of many 
of our fathers.
And ail along, the purfuit of hot trod (flagrant delifto, with

Whereas upon du- confide-

prefcribed; and for that, according to our (aid agreement, Sir William Hutton

when and where they fhould begin, and how they might beft and mod fitly

And for the bettering of his majefty's fervice, and preventing 
further danger that might enfue, by the outlaws, in retorting to the houfes of

directions be given them, unlets he the faid Thomas Routledge (hall come 
in and enter himfelf anfwerable to his majefty's laws as is convenient : Now 
we further, by virtue of our authority from nis majetty fo as directed touching 
the Border fervice, do command you, that the faid watches be duly fearched

CHAPTER X.
Of the ft ate of the Borders, from the reign of king James the firft to the -prefent 
time.
DURING the reign of king Charles the firft, we meet with no regulations 
in particular relating to the Borders.
The ruling powers were mod commonly 
otherwife employed.
And towards the end of that unhappy prince', reign, 
the whole kingdom became Borderers, that is, acted the pare of Borderers 
one againft another.
Soon after the Reftoration of king Charles the fecond, the Marches became 
again an objecl: of public attention, when the act of the 13th and 14th Cha. 2.
c. 22.
(1662), was made, intitled, " An act for preventing of theft and 
rapine upon the Northern Borders of England Â£*.
which was explained by two

cxxxii MODERN STATE OF THE BORDERS.
fubfequent acts, 18 Cha. 2.
c, 3.
and 29 and 30 Cha. 2.
2. all of which 
are in force at this day, and are in fubfrance as follows : 
" Whereas a great number of lewd disorderly and lawlefs perfons, being 
thieves and robbers, who are commonly called Mofs-trccpers, have fucceffivtlv 
for many and fundry years laft pad, been bred, refided in, and frequented 
the Borders cf the two refpeclive counties of Northumberland and Cumber- 
land, and the next adjacent parts of Scotland ; and they, taking the oppor- 
tunity of the large walk ground, heaths and moffes, and the many intricate 
and dangerous ways and by-paths in thofe parts, do ufually, after the mod 
notorious crime; committed by them, efcape over from the one kingdom into 
the other refpectively, and fo avoid the hand of juftice, in regard the offences 
done and perpetrated in the one kingdom cannot be punifhed in the other: 
And v/hereas fince the time of the late unhappy diflraftions, fuch offences 
and offenders as aforefaid have exceedingly more increaled and abounded, and 
the feveral inhabitants of the faid refpective counties have been for divers 
years lafl pad neceffitated, at their own free and voluntary charge, to maintain 
feveral parties of horfe for the neceffary defence of their perfons, families, and 
goods, and for bringing the offenders to juftice; and whereas moft part of 
the inhabitants of the faid counties being more remote from the Borders than 
other parts, and confequently not fo much expofed to imminent dangers as 
others, are therefore unwilling to contribute their proportionable parts of the 
aforefaid charge, and yet notwithftanding, it cannot probably or poffibly be 
avoided, but that thofe inhabitants of the refpe&ive counties who hold them- 
felves moft fecure, muft certainly fuftain much damage and detriment in their 
goods and eftates, in cafe the alorefaid mofs-troopers be not timely fuppreffed, 
but fu fie red to grow numerous, ftrong, and potent, which they mult needs 
do in cafe there be no rellraint upon them : 
It is therefore enacted, that the juftices of peace in feffions (hall have 
power to older an affeffment on every of the inhabitants of the faid counties, 
for the fafeguard of the faid feveral counties and inhabitants thereof, from all 
injury, violence, fpoil, and rapine of the mofs-troopers aforefaid ; fo as Nor- 
thumberland be not charged above 500J a year, nor Cumberland above 
200/.
And the faid juftices fhall have power to employ any perfon, to be chofen 
by them yearly or every two years at the furtheft, to have the command of a 
certain number of men, not exceeding 30 in Northumberland and 12 in 
Cumberland, whereby the malefactors may be fearched out, apprehended, 
and brought to trial : And fuch malefactors being convicted of theft in the 
faid counties refpectively, fhall not have the benefit of clergy.
And the faid juftices fhall take fecurity of the perfon by them employed 
in the faid fcrvice, to anfwer the damages fuftained by any perfon by his 
neglect or default, and to pay the fame within four months after proof there- 
of made on oath at the feflions ; fo as the goods ftolen be entred in one of 
the books to be kept for that purpofe, within 48 hours after the fame fhall 
be ftolen or gone : which books fhall be kept for that end in every market 
f town 
MODERN STATE OF THE BORDERS.
town of the refpeclive counties, and at fuch other convenient places therein, 
and by fuch perfons, as the faid juftices in feffions (hail appoint." 
Finally: In the 5th year of queen Anne, 1706, Articles of Union were 
agreed upon, by commiflioners of both kingdoms reflectively, and confirmed 
by their reipective parliaments ; that from thenceforth the two kingdoms of 
England and Scotland fhould be for ever united into one kingdom, by the 
name of Great Britain â€¢, and that the enfigns armorial of the faid united king- 
dom fhall be fuch as her majefty (hall appoint ; and the croffes of St. George 
and St. Andrew be conjoined in fuch manner as her majefty mail think 
fit, and ufed in all flags, banners, ftandards, and enfigns, both at fea 
and land : 
That the fucceffion to the monarchy (hall be and remain to the princefs 
Sophia, electorefs, and duchefs dowager of Hanover, and the heirs of her 
body, being protectants â€¢, and that all papifts, and perfons marrying papirTs, 
fhall be for ever excluded : 
That the crown, fcepter, and fword of ftate, the records of parliament, 
and all other public records, continue to be kept in Scotland as they were 
before the Union : 
That the kingdom fhall be reprefentsd by one and the fame parliament : 
That 16 peers of Scotland fhall fit in the houfe of lords ; and 45 com- 
moners in the houfe of commons : 
That when the land tax for England fhall be 1,997,763/ Bs 4\d- t Scotland 
fhall pay 48,000/.
With many regulations reflecting trade and navigation, excife, cuftoms, 
duties, fubfidies, and adminiftration of juftice : 
With confirmation of two a<5ts of parliament ; one for fecuring the church 
of England as by law eftalifhed, the other for fecuring the preibyterian church

WESTMORLAND and CUMBERLAND.
OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
ESTMORLAND, Wejlmorehnd, or as it is anciently written 
fVeftmerland) hath its name, according to common acceptation, 
from its being a weftern mocrijh country.
The learned archbifhop 
Ufher, in his Antiquities of the Britifln churches, page 303, quotes feveral 
authors as deriving it from Marius a king of the Britons, who in the firft or 
fecond century defeated Roderic or Rothinger a Pidtifh general from Scythia, 
upon the mountain now called Stanemore â€¢, in memory whereof (he fays) 
Reicrois or Rerecroffe (a red, or royal crofs) was erecled : and from him that 
part of the kingdom was called IVeJlmerland.
But Mr. Camden treats this 
notion as chimerical, and fays, it is only a fancy that fome people have taken 
in their fleep *, and is pofitive that the county hath received its name from the 
barren, mountainous, uncultivated, moorifo land (as he is pleafed to reprefent 
it).
Neverthelefs, there is not one ancient record that we have met with, 
wherein it is not exprefsly called Weftmerland^ and not Wefimorland^ or Wefi- 
mor eland ; which doth not altogether favour Mr. Camden's fuppofition : 
â€¢ Quia tota inter montes alte pertingentes fit fita, et magna ex parte inculta jaceat, hoc nomen 
in noftra lingua invenit.
Loca etenim inculta, et quse non facile agricultura fublevari poflint, mores 
Angl : feptentrionales vocant, et Weft 'norland nihil aliud eft nobu, quam inculta ad occafum regio.

the Latin termination is Wefimaria, fometimes Weftmeria^ which hath ft ill lefs 
refemblance of the moor.
If the county had bordered upon the weftern fea, it 
might have been conjectured that it had received its name from thence ; but as 
Cumberland lies between this county and the fea on the weft, it can fcarcely 
admit of that derivation.
Therefore we mult be content to leave it in the 
fame uncertainty as we found it..
This county is bounded on the Eafl by the counties of Durham and York; 
on the South, by the counties of York and Lancafter; on the Weft, by the 
counties of Lancafter and Cumberland ; and on the North, by the counties 
of Cumberland and Durham.
The length of this county, from Heron-fike in the parifh of Burton on the 
South, to where it adjoins to the counties of Cumberland and Durham on the 
North, is about forty miles; and the breadth thereof is nearly the fame, from, 
the top of Stanemore on the Eaft, to Great L,angdale on the Weft; according 
to the Englifh ftandard, of j 760 yards to a mile, and not according to the 
cuftomary meafure of the country, which is after the proportion of about two 
computed miles to three meafured ones.
From what fource this difference in 
the length of miles did arife, we have not been able to difcover.
It hath no 
reference to the Roman mile.
Theirs was fomewhat fhort of the Englifh 
ftatute meafure, in the proportion (according to Mr. Horfley) of about 13 to 
14.
Mr. Horfley further obferves, that through the moft part of England v 
three computed miles make four in the Itinerary (that is, Roman miles).
Near 
Wales, and in the weftern as well as northern parts of England, two Englifh 
computed miles make three Roman.
It is nearly the fame alfo in Scotland, 
and in fome crofs-roads.
About London and 20 miles round, they are near 
equal, or not above one or two in twenty different..

There is alfo in the counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland a menfura- 
tion of acreS) called cuftomary meafure, which varies from the ftatute meafure, 
and is itfelf alfo diverfe in different places.
The moft general cuftomary 
meafure is that of 6760 fquare yards to the acre, whereas the ftatute meafure 
is only 4840.
In fome parts of Weftmorland, the cuftomary acre is meafured 
to 7840 yards * ; as if where the land is bad, they were willing to give fo much 
the greater meafure.
And there was good reafon for this, inafmuch as they 
proportioned the military duty according to the number of acres that a man 
poffeffed.
But this could be no rule as to the miles : there being no reafon, 
where the road was bad, that therefore they fhould make the miles fo much 
the longer.

The air in this county (efpecially in winter) is fomewhat fharp and fevere, 
but withal very healthful; and people live commonly to a very great age.
And whereas in cities and great towns, fcarce above one third part of thole

that are born do furvive the age of two years, in this county generally not 
above one in thirteen or fourteen dies within that age.
The soil of this county is in many places, as Mr. Camden defcribes it, 
barren and unfruitful -, there being much uncultivated wafle ground, and 
much of it incapable of cultivation.
Yet there are many fruitful and pleafant 
vallies ; and the bottom of Weftmorland (as it is called) hath a confiderable 
quantity of level ground, though furrounded on every fide with high moun- 
tains.
Lying near the weftern ocean, it is much expofed to rain, brought by the 
South weft winds, which blow in this part for above two thirds of the year.
Hence their crops are later by three, four, and in fome places fix weeks, than 
in fome other parts of the kingdom.
This county abounds with mountains, which in the language of the 
country are called Fells, this being the genuine Saxon appellation, and the 
word is yet retained as an epithet in our language, to fignify fomething that is 
wild and boifterous, as we fay a fell temped, a fell tyrant, or the like.
Yet thefe mountains are not altogether unprofitable.
Befides that they fan 
the air, and render it falubrious, they feed large flocks of sheep, of the wool 
whereof the farmers make great advantage.
And the fheep being very fmall, 
and fed for the greater part of the year upon the ling, their mutton is mod 
excellent, efpecially that which is killed in fummer and autumn from off the 
common.
The wool of the fheep is coarfe and thick, fuitable to the climate j 
and, which is very remarkable, where larger fheep, with finer and thinner 
fleeces, have been introduced, the breed gradually diminifhes, and the fleece 
grows thicker, as if nature intended to adapt the animal to its fituation.
So 
the fame fheep, or other cattle, removed to a more favourable climate, grow 
larger and finer.
Thefe mountains alfo produce plenty of grouse, or moor-game-, which are 
nourifhed in like manner chiefly by the ling.
And when that fhrub is in 
flower, about the middle of September, it attracts the induflrious bee ; fo 
that the heath at that feafon feems to be covered as it were with one large fwarm.
This fhrub in Latin is called hruera, and in Domefday-book bruaria.
The faid mountains alfo abound with rivulets, which water the vallies 
beneath : infomuch that in almofl every little village there is water fufficient 
to carry a null ; which renders the precarious help of windmills fuperfluous : 
though, if need fhould be, there are few countries better fituate for fuch like 
conveniences.
Nor are thefe mountains inconfidera'ole in refpecl: of the minerals they 
contain.
The Reverend Thomas Rcbinfon, rector of Oufby, who was a con- 
B 2 noifleur 
Â« 
Â« 
OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
noifieurin that branch of fcience, in an Eflay towards a Natural Hiftory of 
Weftmorland and Cumberland, publifhed in the year 1709, treats of the fame 
in the following manner : he firft takes notice of the mineral productions 
along the ridge of mountains on the North, beginning from Stanemore, 
afcending gradually to the top of Crofs-Fell, and from thence defcending by 
the like gradation to Gilfland in Cumberland.
" The firft elevation of this 
*' ridge (he fays) is called Hilton Fell; the mineral productions whereof are 
" lead and coal : which being of a difagreeing nature, the one renders the 
'* other of little value.
The profpect of lead upon this fell, is only from the 
" appearance of feveral veins of fpar, foil, and vein-ftone, breaking out 
" upon the furface ; and thefe being oftentimes either unripe or dead veins, 
" cheat the miners with vain hopes.
â€” The fecond elevation of this ridge is 
" called Dufton Fell; the mineral productions whereof are chiefly lead : of 
!C which there is fuch plenty got, as keeps a lead mill for the mod part fmelt- 
ing down the ore.
That which is here moft remarkable is, that all the ore 
got upon this mountain is not found in natural veins, which run down 
" perpendicularly or doping (which is moft ufual), but in feams like coal; 
" which run parallel, being inclofed within the ftrata of an hard and folid 
" limeftone fill, without any confiderable depreffion from the horizon.
This 
" we generally call fiat ore, being the overflowing of a rich vein â€¢, and doubt- 
*' lefs, if the miners would be at the charge of crofs-cutting the rife of this 
" limeftone- fill, they would difcover the vein from whence this ore doth flow.
" Upon this mountain there is a petrifying fpring, which turns roofs, or any 
" other porous matter, that either falls into the water and fucky it up.
or 
" comes within the fleam and vapours that arife from it, into ftone ; infornnch 
'* that upon the mouth of the well there is raifed a confiderai le hill of fuch 
*' petrefactions.
The third elevation of this ridge of mountains is called 
" by the name of Silverband ; fo called from the richnefs of the ore, which 
" when refined by art yields a valuable product of filver.
The fourth ele* 
" vation is called BlencarnFell : the mineral productions, by the veins of fpar 
" and foil which appear at day, feem to be lead â€¢, there having been as yet no 
" trials made.
The fifth elevation is Kir kland- Fell; which, as weii as the 
" other mountains, hath its veins of fpar : but as yet no trials have been: 
" made.' The fixth and higheft elevation is Crofs-Fell.
From whence 
" defcending the firft depreffion is Green-Fell; the mineral productions whtrcof 
" are lead, copper, coal, and oker.
The copper is very rich, but fo inter- 
" mixed with the lead ore in the fame vein, that it requires fome labour to 
" feparate them.
In this fell there is a large vein of copperilh fuiphur two 
" yards wiclr, which is difcovered by the rivulet.
I doubt nor, but if this 
'* vein were funk down, till it got its natural feeder, it would turn to -1 -icli 
" vein of copper; for it is very ufual in the kingdom of Peru, that the richeft 
'* veins are fuiphur at the top, and as they get more moifture, turn to copper, 
Â«â€¢ and when funk deeper into the veins, turn to filver.
The coal lieth upon 
" the infide of the mountain, and is io broken and disjointed that it turns to 
" no account.- The fecond depreffion is Melmerby Felt; the mineral pro- 
" ductions are lead, of which fome quantities have been got ; the veins arc

u very hopeful, but no thorough trials have been made.
The third de- 
" predion is Gameljby Fell, known by the name of Hartfide.
The mineral pro- 
M duclions are chiefly coal.
There is fome appearance of veins of glafiy fpar 
" and float copper, but no trials of either have been made.
Here the 
*' metallic clafs changeth into a clafs of coal; and as the lead gradually goes 
" oft, fo the feams of coal do gradually come in and increafe.
The feam of 
" coal at Hartfide colliery is about half a yard thick.
The fourth de- 
" predion is Bujk Fell, where no trials have been made.
The fifth de- 
" preffion is Renw'uk Fell, where the feam of coal is increafed to three quarters 
" thick.
The laft and loweft deprefilon is Coal Fell, fo called from the 
" colliery.
Here the coal clafs is in full ftrength and perfection, the feams 
" being at their full height and growth.
All the folid ftrata upon thefe 
" mountains have their horizontal depreffions, which the miners call dibbing 
" and riling; and they dib moft commonly to the north." 
He then proceeds to the inner parts of the county of Weftmorland, and 
obferves, " At Reagill and Sleagill we meet with fome fmall feams of coal, the 
" main body of the coal lying upon Stanemore-heath ; fo that if the miners 
" fhould fink there for a lower coal and a thicker feam, they would run a 
*' hazard of lofing both labour and money.
For as in all clafies of coal, the 
" feams gradually increafe in thicknefs till they come to their full height and 
" growth ; fo they gradually decreafe till they dwindle out into fmall feams, 
" and then the covers change, and the coal goes out." So in Cumber- 
land he fhews, how the vein of coal comes in at Sourby pafture about eight or 
nine inches thick, then advances to fourteen inches, then at Warnel Fell to 
half a yard, then in the manor of Weftward to a yard, where alfo a fmall feam 
of canel coal comes in ; then in the manor of Bolton it is increafed to kven 
quarters or two yards, and the canel feam to a yard, and the craw coal to three 
quarters.
And here it is come to its full growth and perfection, and fpreads 
over a great part of the level country to the Scotch fea.
He then proceeds to the mountains which are the boundaries of Weftmor- 
land on the South and Weft : and obferves how the feam of coal diminifhing 
from Stanemore (where the feam is about a yard and a quarter thick), comes 
in at Hartley Fell; fo alfo we may add, at Nateby, Mallerjlang, Ravenftondale, 
and otner places.
The weftern fells, he obferves, are of a quite different 
nature from the others above-mentioned, confiding of a blue crag and con- 
tinued rock, without any horizontal flat beds.
And the mineral productions 
of all of them are lead, copper, and iron ; there is no profpect of coal in any 
of them, for where there are no flat and pinguid ftrata, there can be expected 
no coal.
From thefe mountains fine blue flate is got, which fupplies feveral 
parts of the kingdom.
The fame author further obferves : " Though we cannot hope to make any 
" difcovery of veins either of gold or filver in thefe two counties, vet we have 
" rich veins of filvery lead, in which we frequently meet with (tones richly 
*' imoofifed with clufters of diamonds, as bright and fparkling as any we have 
44 from Briftol.
We have alfo in our rich lead veins great variety of fpar t, 
'* fome

" fome white, and as tranfparent as fine chryftal.
We have others green, 
" blue, red, and of a violet colour; which if they could be fo foftened as to 
*' be cut into figures, might be of ufe and value." 
Dr. Woodward, in his Natural Hiitory, fays, " That near Amblefide, and 
" in the ridge of mountains leading from thence to Penrith, there is marble 
" of a duflcy green colour, veined with white ; and in Knipe Scar, are feveral 
" talky fibrous bodies, which might be employed for the making wicks for 
" lamps, as they will burn very long without any fenfible diminution ; they are 
" opake, and of an afh colour.
Fofiils of various kinds are found in different 
" parts of this country; as at Threapland the entrochi and trcchit<e of various 
*' kinds, fome of which are comprefTed and flatted, others raifed and trun- 
" cated, fome hollow in the middle, and filled with grey (tony matter.
Of 
" the fame are thofe found near Strickland-head on the banks of the rivulet 
" which runs down from Snap, and by the inhabitants called Fairy-ftones.
" Here alfo are found the mycetites.
Coralloid bodies are found in great 
" quantities, and differently variegated, near the river Lowther : they will 
" bear a polifh, and are about the hardnefs of Genoefe marble.
Some of the 
" fame kind are found at Helsfell nigh Kendal, and appear beautifully varie- 
" gated, of a brown fandy colour, but fo interfperfed with different colours, 
*' that they are little inferior to Syena marble." â€” Specimens of all thefe are to 
be found in the collection left by Dr. W T oodward to the univerfity of Cam- 
bridge.
Of fome of the more fcarce and curious plants growing in this county, 
we have inferred a catalogue in our Appendix, No. 40.
The rivers in this county are but fmall; for as the mountain tops are for 
the moft part the boundary, the rivers all fpring within the county-, and only 
three, that can properly be called rivers, carry their name to the fea â€¢, to wit, 
Eden, which fprings in Mallerftang, and having received in its courfe (befides 
many lefTer dreams) the conjoined rivers of Lowther and Eamont, enters 
Cumberland, and running the whole length of that county, empties itfelf into 
the fea at Rowcliff.
The fecond river is Lune or Lon, which hath its fource in 
Ravenftondale, and runs down the vale which from the name of the river is 
called Lonfdale, where it enters the county of Loncajier (as it was anciently 
called), and a little below the town of Lancafter falls into the fea.
The third 
is Kent, which rifes in Kentmere, and wafhes the vale which from thence re- 
ceiveth the name of Kendale, and empties itfelf into the fea below Levens.
In the hollows amongft the mountains are formed divers large lakes, having 
fmall rivulets running through them, which preferve the water clear, the lakes 
having commonly a pebbly or rocky bottom ; as Windermere, Ullefwater, 
Haws-water, Kidal-water, Elter- water, Grefmere-water, and other lefTer lakes 
which go by the name of Tarns, as Sunbiggin Tarn, Ravenftondale Tarn, 
Whinfell Tarn, and others.
Which lakes and tarns abound with divers fpecies 
of fifh, as trout, eel, bals, perch, tench, roach, pike, char, and divers others.
3 The 
OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
The fouthern part of this county is alfo pretty well furnifhed with sea fish, 
caught near the Kent and Levens lands, and other places upon the fea coaft.
Which heretofore were brought weekly to Kendal market, infomuch that upon a 
market-day there have been fometimes five and thirty different forts of fifh.
But fince the great improvement of the town and port of Lancafter, the 
market for fifh is confiderably drawn that way.
There is no very great plenty of wood in this county ; it feems to have been 
induftrioufly deflroyed, to prevent its affording fhelter to the Scotch invaders.
It is very certain, that long after the conqueft, this county was over-run with 
wood â€¢, we read of nothing but forefts, and chafes, and parks, and maltage, 
and pannage, and vert, and venifon, and greenhue, and regarders, and 
foreflers, and verderers, and an hundred other names and titles reflecting the 
keeping or prelervacion of the woods and game therein.
In almofl all the 
mofies, there are large trees of oak, fir, birch, and other wood, covered now 
four, five, or fix feet in depth, with that kind of earth that the people dig up 
for fuel, many of which have the marks of the ftroke of the ax upon them, 
and are lying near to their root, which is- at the bottom of the mofs; and the 
tops and leaves, by their floppage of the water draining in:o the vacuities, 
feem to have contributed towards increafing the growth of the peatmofs, which 
in fome places, it is very obfervable, acquires a new covering every year.
The water, weeds, mofs, ftraws, grafs, ling, and other matter, which collect 
in the winter and ftagnate, are dried up in fummer, and effect a new cruft 
upon the former mais.
Upon many of the commons are ridges and furrows, which evidently bear 
the fignature of the plough.
The tradition amongft the country people is, 
that this was done in the reign of king John, when the kingdom was under 
an interdict from the Pope, and the inhabitants thereby prohibited from till- 
ing their improved ground.
But befides that an interdict doth not imply any 
fuch prohibition, being only an hinderance of the celebration of divine offices, 
it feemeth that the true reafon of thefe ploughings which now appear upon 
the common hath been, that thefe places happened to be firfl cleared from 
wood, and afterwards were deferted for more favourable fituations, as the wood 
became gradually cleared away.
In thefe mountains, towards the north-eaft part of the county, is a very 
remarkable phenomenon, fuch as we have not found any account of elfewhere 
in the kingdom, except only about Ingleton and other places bordering upon 
the mountains of Ingleborrow, Pendle, and Penigent, in the confines of the 
counties of York and Lancafter.
It is called a helm-wind.
A rolling cloud, 
fometimes for three or four days together, hovers over the mountain tops, the 
fky being clear in other parts.
When this cloud appears, the country people 
fay the helm is up-, which is an Anglo-Saxon word, fignifying properly a 
covering for the head, from whence comes the diminutive helmet.
This helm 
is notdifperfed or blown away by the wind, but continues in its ftation, although

a violent roaring hurricane comes tumbling down the mountain, ready to tear 
up all before it.
Then on a fudden enfues a profound calm.
And then again

or two from the bottom of the mountain.

we find an 
account of exactly the like appearance on fome of the hills near the Cape of 
Good Hope, thus defcribed by thofc elegant authors: " In the dry feafon, a 
" white cloud hovers over the top of the mountains ; from which cloud ifiue 
" the fouth-weft winds with incredible fury, mattering houfes, endangering 
" fhipping, and greatly damaging the fruits of the earth.
Upon difcovery of 
" which cloud, the failors immediately prepare for a ftorm." 
This county, together with the counties of Cumberland, Northumberland, 
Durham, York, and Lancafter, was anciently the country of the Brigantes, 
who were fubdued by the Romans ; and there are remaining many ancient 
monuments of the Romans in this county to this day.
The great Roman causeway went quite through this county, entering upon 
Stanemore, and going out at Brougham caftle.
Until the turnpike road was 
made, which deftroyed a confiderable part thereof, it was very confpicuous 
almofr.
the whole length of its courfe.
It was carried in a direct ftraight line, 
over hills and dales, through mofles and tarns, as if nothing mould be able to 
interrupt their progrefs.
It was about fix yards in breadth, and on the level 
ground appears to have been made of three courfes of large fquare ftones, the 
loweft courfe being the largeft, and the other two diminifhing gradually, the 
whole three courfes being of the depth of a yard or fomewhat more â€¢, and 
confequently it was able to fuftain an immenfely greater weight of carriages 
than any that are now in ufe.
And the earth which was caft forth to make 
room for the pavement was laid on the outfide, to form the whole into a pro- 
per rotundity.
â€” But this was not in all places the form and manner in which 
they made their roads.
In fome places ftone was not to be had but at a very 
great diltance, in which cafe they made ufe of gravel, flint, or other materials 
which the country furnifhed.
And where they had not folid ftone, they made 
the road fo much the higher and broader.
hrom the general elevated form 
of the Roman roads, Mr. Horfley conjectures that the denomination of high- 
way given to all publick roads derives its original.
There v/as alfo a Roman way, called Maiden way, branching out from 
the other at Kirkby Thore, and ftretching northwards over the low end of Crofs- 
Fell, to where it joined with the Picts* wall in Northumberland.
From 
whence it received this name we know not.
At its firft entrance upon Stane- 
more, it paffeth by a place called Maiden caftle, which was a fmall fquare fort 
of Roman ftru&ure, as appeared by the .mortar found therein.
(MacheL) 
In modern military language, a Maiden fort fignifies one that has never 
been taken, by reafon of its extraordinary ftrength.
But that could never be 
applicable to this fmall fortification upon Stanemore.
It rather feems to be 
derived of the Anglo-Saxon Mai (maigan, ma?an i magnum) great, and Dun a 
hill.

In Northumberland, this fame military road bears the fame name of 
the Maiden way.
Under the caftle of Wark in the faid county, there is a walk

And at Cattle Well near Wooler in the fame county, 
is an intrenchment called by this fame name of the Maiden caftle.

There are no fewer than eight good turnpike roads in this county, 
feven of which terminate at, or pafs through, the town of Kendal.
One of 
thefe roads goes through the bottom of Weftmorland, and follows (but with 
fome variations) the direction of the Roman way, from the top of Stanemore 
where it comes in from Yorkfliire, through Brough, by Appleby, to Eamont 
bridge, where it enters Cumberland.
Another, from Kendal, through Kirkby Lonfdale to Keighly in Yorkshire.
The third, from Kendal to Sedbergh in the county of York, and from thence 
branching out to Kirkby Stephen on one fide, and to Afkrigg in the county of 
York on the other fide.
The fourth, from Kendal, branching out nigh Tebay, through Raven- 
ftonale and Kirkby Stephen to Brough on one fide j and through Orton to 
Appleby on the other fide.

through Burton, Kendal, and Shap, to Eamont bridge.
The fixth, from Kendal, by Amblefide and Dunmal Raife, to Kefwick in 
Cumberland, with a branch from Plumbgarths Crofs nigh Kendal to Winder-

And the eighth, from Kendal to Milthorp, and from thence communicating

The inhabitants of this county are generally a fober, focial, humane, 
civilized people; owing in fome meafure to the inftitution of fmall fchools in 
almoft every village.
And in the larger towns, as Appleby, Heverfham, 
Kendal, Bampton, Kirkby Lonfdale, and Kirkby Stephen, there are free 
fchools handfomely endowed.
Infomuch that it is a rare thing in this county, 
to find any perfon who cannot both read and write tolerably well.
Barren as the foil is in many places, the county is very populous, perhaps 
more populous in proportion to the value of the lands than any other county 
in the kingdom.
Every man lives upon his own fmall tenement, and the 
practice of accumulating farms hath not yet here made any confiderable pro- 
grefs.
Here are large remains of the ancient feudal policy, which was kept 
up in thefe parts after it had ceafed elfewhere, by reafon of the particular mi- 
litary fervice againft the Scots.
The lands at firft were granted out in large 
diftricts by William the conqueror and his fuccefibrs to certain great Norman 
barons.
Thefe parcelled them out to inferior lords i who again granted the 
Vol. I.

fame to individuals, each man having a portion of land afligned to him for 
the fuftentation of the military character.
And they feem to have extended this 
regulation as far as it would go.
The foldier's eftate, from the number of 
ancient tenements in the feveral manors, appears to have been fmall, as what 
perhaps would now let for about ten or twelve pounds a year.
And befides 
the general military fervices in the King's wars at home and abroad, thefe 
tenants in the borders were liable (as hath been obferved before) to be called 
out in the particular fervice againft the Scots, at the command of the lords 
wardens of the marches.
All the ancient manor houfes and other buildings in this county appear 
to have been formed, not fo much for ornament, or even utility in other re- 
fpects, as for defence againft the Scotch incuriions.
The larger houfes had 
areas or yards ftrongly walled about, with turrets and battlements ; within 
which inclofures they fhut up their cattle in the night-time, or otherwife occa- 
fionally as they had notice given to them by the firing of beacons or other in- 
telligence.
The lefier houfes were fecured with ftrong doors and gates, having the win- 
dows very fmall, and croffed with: ftrong bars of iron.
And many of the 
country houfes, for the greater fafety, had the cow-houfe and ftable underneath 
the dwelling-houfe.
Even the very diverfions of the children had a reference to this border en- 
mity.
The boys to this day have a play which they call Scotch and Euglijh -, 
which is an exact picture in miniature of the Raid, that is, of the inroad by 
plundering parties.
The boys divide themfelves into two companies, under 
two captains, who chufe their men alternately.
Then they ftrip off their coats, 
the ond party calling themfelves Scots, the other Englifh.
They lay their 
cloaths reflectively all on an heap, and fet a flone as it, were a bounder mark 
between the two kingdoms, exactly in the middle between their heaps of cloaths.
Then they begin to make incurfions into each other's territories-, the Englifh 
beginning with this reviling exprefiion, " Here's a leap in thy land,, dry-bellied 
" Scot." And fo they plunder and fteal away one from another all that they 
can lay their hands on.
But if they, can take hold of any invader within their 
own jurifdiction, either before or after he catcheth his booty, which they call 
a wed, (the fame being a Saxon word* waed, weda, weed, not yet, quite out of 
ufe, fignifying cloathing) unlefs he efcape clear into his own province, they take 
him prifoner, and carry him to the wed or heap of cloaths,, from whence he is 
not to remove till fome of his own party break in, and by fwiftnefs of foot 
lay hold of the prifoner, before he himfelf be touched by any of the adverfe 
party ; which if the adverfary do, he hath refcued his man, and may carry him 
off without moleftation.
And thus fometimes one party will fo far prevail 
over the other, what with plundering, and what with taking prifoners,.
that 
the other fhall have nothing at all left.
It is a very active and violent re- 
creation.

The bread ufed by all perfons of condition in this county is made of wheat, 
but the common people eat oaten bread (as they do alfo in Scotland, hence the} 
abovementioned farcaftical expreffion of dry-bellied Scot) ; for the fupply where- 
of in this county, there is not a fufficient quantity of oats grown within the 
county, but they receive many loads thereof every week out of Cumberland, 
and fome out of the counties of Lancafter, York, and Durham : The land in 
Weftmorland yielding better for grazing.
And therefore they breed a large 
number of cattle yearly, and fell them out at three or four years of age.
And they make a considerable advantage by the fale of butter y efpecially 
fince the turnpike road was made over Stanemore, whereby a communication 
by land-carriage is opened to the fea-port towns, from whence they fupply the 
London markets.
Weftmorland hams alfo, which are cured in the fmoke of 
peat fewel, are much preferable to thofe cured elfewhere in the coal fire 
chimnies.
In the article of cloathing, they have departed of late years from their 
ancient fimplicity.
Their forefathers were wont to cloath themfelves with 
their own wool manufactured at home, which wool is now bought up for the 
ufe of the manufacturers at Kendal and in the Weft Riding of Yorkfhire.
Clogs, inftead of (hoes, the labouring people ftillwear; the upper part where- 
of is made of ftrong curried leather, and the fole of wood fhod and bound 
about with iron.
The language of the country people hath large remains of the ancient 
Saxon.
Which (hews, that although William the conqueror granted the lands 
to fome of the principal leaders amongft his Normans, and they to other mefne 
-lords their countrymen; yet they did not difpofifefs the ancient inhabitants en- 
tirely, but granted to them lands to hold under the refpeftive mefne lords, or 
otherwife kept them in a ftate of villenage.
This county is divided into two great baronies; the barony of Kendal, 
and the barony of Westmorland : this latter is fometimes called the barony 
of Jppleby, but moft commonly in ancient times the barony of Weftmorland.
Indeed the barony of Kendal feemeth not formerly to have been deemed a 
part of Weftmorland, but rather of Lancafhire.
In the Domefday-furvey, an 
account is taken of many places within this barony of Kendal, together with 
the adjoining places in Lancafhire and Yorkfhire * ; whereas of Weftmorland 
properly 
* Thus, in Ouftewic and Heldetune there are 12 manors recited which had belonged to Torfin, 
viz.
Clapeham, Middletun, Manzerge, Cherceby, Lupetun, Preftun, Holme, Bortune, Hotune, 
Wartun, Claclun, Catun : And two thirds of thefe clearly are in Weftmorland, viz.
Middlcton, 
Manfcigh, Kirkby (Lonfdale), Lupton, Prelton, Holme, Burton, and Hutton (piobably that 
part now called Hutton Roof).

properly fo called no furvey was made, being all wafted and deftroyed, and 
worth nothing.
And the barons of Kendal, we find, contefted the right of 
jurifdi&ion of the fheriff of Weftmorland within their boundaries.
And fo- 
late as the reign of king Henry the eighth, this barony of Kendal compre- 
hended a confiderable part of Lancafhire.
Warton is often mentioned as be- 
ing within this barony â€¢, and there is a record in the Dutchy office, which de- 
termines many other places to be within this barony -f- .
And it exended a good way into that part which is now called the Bottom 
of Weftmorland â€¢, particularly into almoft all the weftern part, comprehending 
tke greateft part of the parifhes of Barton, Lowther, and Morland.
And the 
barons of Kendal were patrons alfo of the church of Kirkby Stephen, and 
gave it and alfo the church of Morland to the abbey of St. Mary's York.
But now the boundary of the barony of Kendal, as diftinguifhed from the 
Bottom of Weftmorland, is the fame nearly as the boundary of the feveraL 
parifhes of Grefmere and Kendal on one fide, and Barton, Shap, and Orton, 
on the other* 
The hundreds in this county are diftinguifhed by the name of wards, and.
are four in number j being the diftricts of the like number of High Con- 
ftables, who prefid-ed over the wards to be fuftained at certain fords and other

â€¢f- In the firft year of king Henry the eighth, it was found, by inquifition in the county of Lan- 
cafter, that Margaret late countefs of Richmond and Derby, the faid king's grandame, was feifed 
in her demefne as of fee for the term of her life of the third part of the lordfhip or town of Whit- 
tington, and the lordfhip or town of Warton, and of 20/ fee farm going out of the manors of 
Afhton and Berneforth, and of the moiety of the lordfhip or manor of Nether Wyrefdale, and of 
the third part of the old lordfhip of Scotford in the faid county ; the reverfion to Henry the eighth 
in right of his dutchy of Lancafter, and as parcel of our county palatine of Lancaiter..
Since 
which, by another office taken by virtue of a.
commiffion, it is found, that our noble progenitor 
king Henry the fixth was feifed of the lordfrrips, towns, and hamlets of Nether Wyrefdale,.
Why c- 
ington, Scotford, Warton, Moreholm, Afheton, and Kerneford in the faid county, of Lancaiter, in 
his demefne as of fee, as members and parcel of the manor, lordfhip, or barony of Kendal in the 
county of Weftmorland.
The which lordfhips, towns, and hamlets, fpecified in the faid later of- 
fice, we understand to be the fame manors, lands, tenements, rent, fee farms, and other the pre- 
mifes named and fpecified by the faid other names in the faid firft office, and be all one, and not 
diverfe.
And' further it was found by the faid later office, that king Henry the fixth gave all the 
premifes to Edmund then earl of Richmond and to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten, by the 
name of his manor and lordfhip of Kendale,.
and manor and lordfhip of Wyrefdale, with the ap- 
purtenances, in the counties of Weftmorland and Lancaiter, and of other lands and tenements, 
and of other things, as more plainly appeareth by the faid fecond office; and fo defcended to our 
father, fon and heir in tail to the faid Edmund late earl of Richmund j and that Henry the feventh 
gave all the faid premifTes to our faid grandame for term of her life, by the name of the third part 
of the lordfhip and manor of Kendale, and of the lordfhip and manor of Wyrefdale, with the 
appurtenances, in the counties of Lancafter and Weftmorland.
Whereupon we perceive they 
were not Dutchy land, but members of our barony of Kendale in the county of Weftmorland.
Whereupon the king now commands to make fTuftrate the faid firft office found by the efcheator of 
Lancafhire.

places, for repelling plundering parties out of Scotland.
Two of thefe wards 
are in the barony of Kendal, to wit, Kendal and Lonfdale Wards; and two 
in the Bottom, called Eaft and Weft Wards : There was anciently a Middle 
Ward between thefe two laft ; but fince watching and warding ceafed, that 
hath fallen into and been abforbed by the other two.
The barony of Kendal is in the diocese of Chejler; and therein are two 
rural deanries, the deanry of Kendal, and the deanry of Kirkby Lonfdale, 
both of which extend alfo into the adjoining parts of Lancafhire.
The Bot- 
tom of Westmorland is in the dioceie of Carlifle, and is all one rural deanry, 
called the deanry of Weftmorland.
This office of rural dean had anciently a 
large jurifdietion annexed to it, but by degrees hath fallen into difufe.
But fo 
late as the year 1571, we find Robert Pcarfon dean of Weftmorland receiver 
of the fubfidy granted to the crown by the clergy, and alfo of the procura- 
tions and fynodals paid to the biihop.
It is a vulgar miftake, that this county paid no fubfidies during the exiftence 
of the border fervice, as fuppofing it to be exempted from fuch payment 
merely upon that account.
For we find all along fuch and fuch perfons.
collectors of the fubfidies in this county, granted both by clergy and laity.
The land tax fucceeded into the place of fubfidies ; being not fo properly a 
new tax, as an old tax by a new name.
From the reign of Edward the third 
downward, certain fums and proportions were fixed upon the feveral townfhips 
within the refpeclive counties, according whereunto the taxation hath con- 
ftantly been made *.
In procefs of time this valuation may be fuppofed to> 
have become unequal, efpecially fince by the increafe of trade and.
manufac- 
ture in fome large towns much wealth is accumulated within a fmall compafs, 
the tax upon fuch divifion continuing ftill the fame.
And hence a new valu- 
ation hath often been fuggefted to render this tax more adequate, which ne^ 
verthelefs from the nature of the thing muft always be fluctuating according 
to the increafe or diminution of property in different parts of the kingdom.
But in reality this notion proceeds upon a very narrow and partial principle; 
An equal lax, according to what a man is worth, is one thing â€¢, and an equal 
land tax, all the other taxes being unequal, is quite another.
Setting afide 
* In Cumberland, the manner of laying public taxes and affeiTments is fomewhat peculiar, by a 
rate called the Purvey, which originally was a compofuion in money for the king's purveyance^ or 
providing for his houfhold, when he went on a progrefs into different parts of the kingdom.
In 
fome places it was paid in cattle, or other provifions in kind : Hence in Lancafhire they have a 
manner of laying affeffments ftill called ex-lay, Againft king James's return out of Scotland through 
the county of Cumberland in September 1617, the juftices of the peace were ordered to compound 
for the king's purveyance at the rate of 108 /, or thereabouts; which fum being laid through the 
whole county, became afterwards a rule for laying moft of the other affeffments, calling it one pur- 
vey when 108/ was raifed, two purveys when 216/ was raifed, and fo on.
In the year 1665, for 
the more eafe and convenience, the purvey was fixed at the precife fum of joo/; fo that where the 
fum of 100/ is wanted, it is called one purvey ; where zco'l two purveys; and fo on ;.and the 
feme was proportioned amongft the feveral wards, as it ftill continues.
Thirty-feven purveys and 
an half nearly make up one land tax,, when the land tax is at 4/ in the pound.
Flem, 
the; 
14 
OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
the populous manufacturing towns, let us take the county of Weftmorland 
in general (in which there is no fuch manufacturing town, Kendal only ex- 
cepted); and we (hall find that this county, upon the whole, taking all the 
taxes together, pays more to the government, in proportion to the wealth of 
the inhabitants, than perhaps any other county in the kingdom.
And that 
is by reafon of its comparative populoufnefs.
Suppofe a townfhip (which is 
a common cafe in Weftmorland) worth about 400/ a year.
In this townfhip 
there are about 40 meffuages and tenements, and a family in each meffuage.
And at the proportion of five perfons to a family, there are 200 inhabitants.
Thefe, by their labour and what they confume, are worth to the public double 
and treble the value of the land tax in its higheft eftimation.
Thefe 40 mef- 
fuages or dwelling- houfes, at 3 s each, pay yearly 61 houfe duty-, and fo 
many of them perhaps have above feven windows, as will make up 6 / more.
Now let us advance further South.
An eftate of 400/ a year is there fre- 
quently in one hand.
There is one family of perhaps 15 or 20 perfons ; one 
houfe duty of 3J, fome few fhillings more for windows-, and a tenth part 
of the confumption of things taxable, as fait, foap, leather, candles, and 
abundance of other articles.
Now where is the equality ?
One man for 10/ 
or 5 / a year, pays as much houfe duty, as another perfon for 400/ a year.
In Weftmorland many perfons (and the clergy almoft in general) dwell in 
houfes that pay more houfe and window duty than the houfe itftlf would let 
for.
And in other refpefts, the public is as much benefited by three or four 
families occupying ten or twenty pounds a year each, as in the other cafe by 
one family occupying ten times as much.
It hath been computed by political calculators, that every perfon, one with 
another, is Worth to the public 4/ a year.
On that fuppofition, the inhabit- 
ants in one cafe are eftimated at 800/, in the other cafe at 80/.
So if we re- 
duce the fum to half, or a quarter, or any other fum -, it will always come out 
the fame, that the one and the other are of value to the public, juft in the 
proportion of ten to one.
In fhort : Populoufnefs is the riches of a nation; not only from the con- 
fumption of things taxable, but for the fupplyof hands to arts, manufacture, 
war, and commerce.
A man that puichafeth an eftate, and lays it to his own, 
making one farm of what was two before, deprives the public of a propor^ 
tionable fhare of every tax that depends upon the number of houfes and inha- 
bitants.
A man that gets a whole village or two into his poffefiion by this 
means, confiding of an hundred ancient feudal tenements, evades ninety-nine 
parts in an hundred of fuch taxes, and throws the burden upon others, who by 
reafon of the fmalloefs of their property are proportionably lefs able to bear 
it; for a man of an hundred pounds a year can better fpare twenty pounds, 
than a man of ten pounds a year can fpare forty fhillings; for the one has 
eighty pounds left, and the other only eight.
The general military tenure of the lands in this county was by homage, fealty, 
and cornage-y which cornage drew after it ward/hip, marriage, and relief.
And 
the fervice of this tenure was knight's fervice.
Homage 
OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
,y 
Homace (according to Littleton) was the mod honourable fcrvice, and 
mod humble fervice of reverence, that a free tenant can do to his lord.
For 
when the tenant was to do homage to his lord, he was to appear ungirt of his 
fword, with his head uncovered, and the lord was to fit, and the tenant kneel 
berore him on both his knees,, and hold his hands extended and joined toge- 
ther, between the hands of his lord, and was to fay thus : u I become your 
" man, from this day forward, of life and limb and earthly honour, and unto 
" you will be true and faithful, and faith unto you will bear for the tenements 
" that 1 claim to hold of you ; faving the faith that I owe to our fovereign 
** lord the king." And then the lord fo fitting was to kifs him.
(Littleton's 
Tenures, feft.
85.) â€” It had its name from homo; I become your man, â€” Jeo de- 
veigne voftre kerne.
Fealty is the fame zsfidelitas in latin.
And when a free tenant was to do* 
fealty to his lord, he was to hold his right hand upon a book, and fay thus : 
â€¢* Know ye this, my lord, that I will be faithful and true unto you, and faith 
<c to you will bear for the tenements which 1 claim to hold of you, and that 
" I will lawfully do to you the cuitoms and fervices which I ought to do at 
** the terms affigned : So help me God and his Saints." But he was not to 
kneel nor make fuch humble reverence as in homage; and fealty might be 
done before the fteward of the court, but homage could only be done to the 
lord himfelf.
(Litt.
feft., 91, 92.) 
(Corna.ce we will fpeak of by and by, when we have explained the three 
incidents thereof, wardfhip, marriage, and relief.
â€” Wardship and marriage 
was thus : When the tenant died, and his heir male was within the age of 21 
years, the lord was to have the land holden of him until the heir mould attain 
that age-, becaufe the heir by intendment of law was not able to do knights 
fervice before his age of 21 years.
And if fuch heir was not married at the 
time of the death of his anceftor, then the lord was to have the wardfhip and 
marriage of him.
But if the tenant died leaving an heir female, which heir 
female was of the age of 14 years or upwards, then the lord was not to have 
the wardlhip of the land, nor of the body ; becaufe a woman of that age 
might have a hufband able to do knights fervice.
But if fuch heir female was 
under the age of 14 years and unmarried at the time of the death of hen an- 
ceftor, the lord was to have the wardlhip of the land holden of him until the 
age of fuch heir female of 14 years â€¢, within which time the lord might tender 
unto her covenable marriage without dilparagement : And if the lord did not 
tender fuch marriage within the faid age, fhe might have emred into the land, 
and oufted the lord.
(Litt.
feft.
103.) 
Relief was a certain fum of money that the heir, on coming of age, paid 
unto the lord, on taking pofTcffion of the inheritance of his anceftor ; by pay^ 
ment whereof, the heir relieved, (relevabat) that is,, as it were raifed up again 
the lands, after they had fallen into the hands of the fuperior.
And on 
payment of the relief, the heir had.
livery of the lands, that is, the lands 
5 were 
if, OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL 
were to be delivered to the heir â€¢, and in cafe of refufal, the heir might have a 
writ to recover the fame from the lord, which recovery out of the bands of the 
lord, was called oufter le main.
And for the fuller execution of thefe purpofes, in cafe of the king's tenants 
in capite, an officer was appointed, called the Efcheator, to whom a writ iffued 
on the death of fuch tenant, to take the lands into the king's hands, and to 
inquire by a jury, how much land fuch tenant held of the king in capite, what 
was the yearly value thereof, who was his heir, and of what age: Which writ 
was called a writ of Diem claufit extremum (from thefe words contained in the 
writ) â€¢, and the finding of the jury was called an Inquifttion poft mortem* .
For 
the more certain and regular proceedings in which matter, a court of Wards 
and Liveries was erected by acl: of parliament in the reign of king Henry the 
eighth.
All thefe circumftances of homage, fealty, wardjhip, marriage, and relief, were 
common to the military fervice in general.
Cornage feems to have been pe- 
culiar to the Border fervice againft the Scots.
Sir Matthew Hale in his com- 
ment (hereafter fet forth) upon king John's charter to Robert de Veteripont of 
Appleby and Burgh, and the (heriffwick and rent of the county of Weftmor- 
land, juft takes notice of it, and fays, it is a tenure not known to the fouchern 
parts of England.
And judge Littleton, in his book of tenures, in the chap- 
ter concerning Grand Serjeanty, fpeaks of this fervice only upon hearfay.
" It 
'* is faid," he obferves, " that in the marches of Scotland, fome hold of the 
" king by cornage, that is to fay, to wind a horn to give the men of the coun- 
" try warning, when they hear that the Scots or other enemies are come or 
" will enter into England ; which fervice is grand ferjeanty.
But if a tenant 
" hold of any other lord than of the king by fuch fervice of cornage, this is 
" not grand ferjeanty, but is knights fervice; for none may hold by grand 
" ferjeanty but of the king only.
And it draweth to it ward and marriage." 
Sir Edward Coke, in his comment on the fecond chapter of Magna Charta, 
which afcertains what relief Ihall be paid by the military tenants of the crown, 
faith, (2 lnft.
9.) that tenure by cornage is not within this ftatute of Magna 
Charta, becaufe Littleton faith, that it draweth unto it ward/hip and marriage,

and fpeaketh nothing of relief.
But it is very evident from many of the inqui- 
fitions pojl mortem of the Cliffords and others, that this fervice of cornage did 
draw unto it wardjhip, marriage, and relief.
And it is ob'ervable, that Little- 
ton, though he exprefleth only wardfhip and marriage, yet he doth not exclude 
relief and fpeaketh of the whole matter, not as of his own knowledge, but 
by the report of others.
And the fame learned commentator recites a very 
notable record in the eighteenth year of the reign of king Edward t\v- firft, 
between John de Graiftoke plaintiff, and Idonea de Leybut n defendant, con- 
cerning a relief to be paid to her by the faid John, for the manors of Dufton, 
Brampton, Yanewich, and Bolton (for thofe were the manors he po fie fled, 
tho' from the copy it feems that the names were not very legible in the record) 
which he as mefne lord held of the faid Idonea.
In which difpute it was ad- 
mitted by both parties that & relief was due, and they differed only about the

Idonea had diflrained his goods for a relief to be paid for his 
lands at the aforefaid places, which he held of her by homage and cornage, and 
which were worth by the year ioo/.
And me faid, that the cuftom in Weft- 
morland is fuch, that the heirs after the death of their anceftors ought to re- 
lieve their lands from the lords of whom they are holden, by paying for re- 
lief as much as the lands are worth by the year, unlefs they can agree with 
their lords for lefs.
Whereupon (he avows the taking of the diftrefs for a 
relief according to the faid cuftom.
John.de Graiftoke denies that there is 
fuch cuftom, but admits that he holds his tenements aforefaid by the cornage of 
25 j 6 d; and faith, that his anceltors in time paft doubled the faid cornage, 
by paying to the anceftors of the faid Idonea 51 s.
She replies, that foraf- 
much as the faid John admits that he holds the tenements aforefaid by cornage, 
fuch relief is incident thereunto by virtue of the faid cuftom ; and faith, that 
the faid John and his anceftors for time immemorial have required the like 
relief againft his tenants in the fame county.
And concerning the cuftom, 
they both put themfdves upon the country.
Moreover the faid idonea faith, 
that there is a twofold tenure in the county of Weftmorland, to wit, one by 
White rent [which was a rent paid in filver, vulgarly, but improperly, called a 
quit-rent] and another by cornage : And that the tenants by White rent, after 
the death of their anceftors, ought to double their rent only ; and the tenants 
by cornage, after the death of their anceftors, ought to pay the value of their 
lands for one year.
And John faith on the contrary, that the cuftom of the 
country is, that the heirs mail not pay but by doubling the cornage *.

The perfonal fervice of cornage, if ever it was in aÂ£bual exercife, ceafed very 
early, and was converted into a pecuniary payment ; which was accounted for 
to the crown, and paid yearly into the exchequer.
And perhaps from the 
firft it might be a ftipulated payment, for the finding of fcouts and homers, 
and procuring intelligence.
And by reafon of the fcarcity of filver (for gold 
coins were not in ufe till long after) it feemeth that this cornage rent was at 
firft paid in cattle, which kind of payment was called noutegeld, and under 
that name was accounted for in the exchequer, in the reign of king Henry the 
fecond.
(Denton, from the Red Book, in the exchequer.) And to this day, in 
the Bottom of Weftmorland, the cornage rent is paid under the name of neatgeld.
This rent, together with the fherifFwick, was granted by king John as afore- 
faid to Robert de Veteripont, by the name of the rent of the county of 
Weftmorland ; and the pofterity of the faid Robert ftill enjoy the fame.
But 
the noutegeld within the barony of Kendal was not included within that grant; 
the fame having been quitted before and extinguished by grant from king 
Richard the firft to Gilbert fon of Roger Fitzreinfred.
Thefe cornage tenants were bound, in their mod defenfible array for the 
wars, to be ready to ferve their prince and the lord of the manor, upon horfe- 
back or on foot, at their own proper cofts and charges ; and when the king's 
army paffed into Scotland, they had the poft of honour to march in the van- 
guard ; and on their return, in the rereguard j\ And for good reafon : be- 
caufe they belt knew the paffes and defiles, and the way and manner of the 
enemy's attacking and retreating.
The White rent, or payment in money, above mentioned, was what is now 
called the lord's rent.
And hereupon we may obferve, that in thofe day?, 
on the death of the tenant, the lord required only that rent to be doubled; and 
in the cafe of cornage, it was demanded to have one year's value of the lands, 
which on the other fide was contefted, infilling only to pay double of the 
cornage.
Whereas in fucceeding ages, the lords have advanced to eight or 
ten and in fome places to twenty times the ancient rent, and in other places 
to two years improved value of the lands.
The crown tenants in the barony 
of Kendal continue neareft to the ancient eftablifhment, paying only double

and in fome places treble of the lord's rent, for a fine on the death of the 
tenant ; whereas the other tenants in divers parts of the faid barony have been 
required to pay two years value of the lands : notwithftanding that until after 
the death of William de Lancaftre the third in the reign of king Henry the 
third, the tenure throughout the faid barony was intirely the fame, under one 
and the fame lord.
Befides the aforefaid military fervices, we find another fervice often men- 
tioned, called scutage, or efcuage; from the latin word fcutum y a fhield : 
which was a compenfation in money, inftead of perfonal fervice againft the 
Scots.
This fervice by efcuage was indeed no part of the border fervice, for 
in the border fervice perfonal and immediate attendance was abfolutely ne- 
cefiary to repel fudden and defultory incurfions ; but efcuage was when a royal 
army marched, not againft the borders particularly, but againft the kingdom 
of Scotland.
Concerning which, Littleton expreffeth himfelf in the like cau- 
tious manner as before : " It is faid, that when the king makes a voyage 
" royal into Scotland to fubdue the Scots, he which holdeth by the fervice 
" of one knight's fee ought to be with the king forty days, well and con- 
" veniently arrayed for the war; and he which holdeth his land by the moiety 
c< of a knight's fee, ought to be with the king twenty days ; and he which hold- 
** eth his land by the fourth part of a knight's fee, ought to be with the king 
tc ten days: and fo he that hath more, more; and he that hath lefs, lefs.
" And after fuch voyage royal into Scotland, it is commonly faid, that by 
" authority of parliament, the efcuage fhall be afleffed and put in certain, that 
*' is, a certain lum of money, how much everv one which holdeth by a whole 
" knight's fee, who was neither by himfelf nor by any other with the king, 
w fhall pay to his lord of whom he holds his land by efcuage.
As put the 
" cafe that it was ordained by parliament, that every one which holdeth by a 
ct whole knight's fee, who was not with the king, fhall pay to his lord 40 s- 3 
" then he which holdeth by the moiety of a knight's fee, fhall pay to his lord 
*' but 20s ; and he which holdeth by the fourth part of a knight's fee, fhall 
" pay 10 j; and he which hath more, more; and he which hath lefs, lefs." 
Lit t.
feci.

There hath been great diverfity of opinions concerning the value of a 
knight's fee, that is, how much land was deemed fufficient for the main*- 
tenance of a knight.
Sir Edward Coke fays, " Some hold, that a knight's 
" fee confifted of 8 hides, and every hide contained 100 acres; and lb a 
** knight's fee fhould contain 800 acres : others fay that a knight's fee con- 
" tained 680 acres.
But I hold," fays he, " that a knight's fee doth not con- 
** tain any certain number of acres ; but is properly to be eftimated according 
" to the quality, and not according to the quantity of the land, that is to fay, 
*' by the value, and not by the number of acres." (1 Inft.
69.) Neverthe- 
less, in thefe northern parts, it appears from an entry made in the Regifter of 
the priory of Wetheral, that the knight's fee was eftimated, not according to 
the quality, but quantity of the land.
And this feems to account for the large 
rneafure of an acre before mentioned, in order to compenfate for the defi- 
D 2 ciency 
2o OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL.
ciency in goodnefs.
There we find explicitly, that ten acres make one ferndell, 
four ferndells one virgate (which is half a carucate), four virgates one hide, 
and four hides one knight's fee *.
So that the knight's fee in this cafe will 
amount to 640 acres.
The value of thefe appears to have been afcertained at 
the time of Magna Charta â€¢, which fixes the relief to be paid for a knight's 
fee at 5 /â€¢, and as the relief in all the cafes there fpecified was after the rate of 
one fourth part of the yearly value of the fee, it follows that a knight's fee 
was then eftimated at 20/ a year.
All thefe particulars are neceffary to be known, in order to the underftand- 
ing of the ancient date of this county.
But happily now moft of this know- 
ledge is only matter of curiofity, all the tenures by knights fervice with all the 
incidents and confequences thereof having been abolifhed by act of parliament 
foon after the restoration of king Charles the fecond.
For by the act of 12 C.
2. 
c. 24.
it is enacted as followeth : Whereas it hath been found by experience that 
the court of wards and liveries, and tenures by knights fervice, and the confe- 
quents thereupon, have been much more burdenfome, grievous, and prejudicial 
to the kingdom, than beneficial to the king ; be it enacted, that the court of 
wards and liveries, and all wardlhips, liveries, primer feifins, and oufterlemains, 
values and forfeitures of marriages, and all fines for alienations, feizures and 
pardons for alienations, tenure by homage, and all tenures by knights fervice of 
the king or of any other perfon, and by knights fervice in capite, and by focage 
in capite of the king, and all the incidents and confequences thereof, (hall be 
and are hereby taken away and difcharged ; and all tenures of any honours, ma- 
nors, lands, or any eftate of inheritance at common law, held either of the king 
or any other perfon, fhall be turned into free and common focage, and fhall ftand 
and for ever be difcharged of all tenure by homage, efcuage, voyages royal, 
and charges for the fame, wardfhips incident to tenure by knights fervice, and 
values and forfeitures of marriage, and all other charges incident to tenure by 
knights fervice.
Provided, that this fhall not be conftrued to take away any 
rents certain, heriots, or fuits of court, belonging to any former tenure now 
taken away or altered by this act, or the fealty and diftreffes incident thereto; 
and that fuch relief fhall be paid in refpect of fuch rents, as is paid in cafe 
of the death of a tenant in common focage.
And provided, that this fhall 
not take away any fines for alienation due by particular cuftoms of particular 
manors and places, other than fines for alienations of lands or tenements holden 
immediately of the king in capite.
And alfo provided, that this fhall not be 
conftrued to take away any tenures in frankalmoign, or to fubject them to any

So much concerning the military tenure.
â€” But befides all this, there was 
another tenure in Weftmorland, which hath greatly puzzled antiquarians to 
explain or understand.
It was called Drengage.
Sir Matthew Hale, in his 
exposition aforefaid of the Veteripont charter, takes notice of it, and fays, 
that there is no fuch tenure in the fouthern parts of England, and obferves 
from the records before him that it drew wardlhip and relief.
Sir Henry 
Spelman in his GlofTary, on the words Drenches, Drenges, Drengagium, fays, 
thefe words had perplexed him a long time: (Voces alt'tus fopita, et qua me dkt 
torfere.) He recites feveral records, wherein thefe words had occurred to 
him, and conjectures upon the whole, that the Drenges were free tenants hold- 
ing by military fervice.
But there are other records, which had not fallen 
under the infpection of that learned author, that deftroy this notion intirely.
Mr. Denton, from the Red Book in the exchequer, obferves, that Sir Hugh 
Morvil in Weftmorland changed drengage into free fervice*; which implies, 
that it was not free before.
At Brougham in this county, Gilbert de Burg- 
ham gave one half of the village of Brougham to Robert de Veteripont of 
whom he held in drengage, that the other half might be free from that fervice.
At Clifton alfo in this county, and other neighbouring parts, there were dren- 
gage tenants ; and in the 31 Ed. 3, Gilbert de Engain of Clifton granted by 
indenture to Roger de Clifford lord of Weftmorland the fervices of divers per- 
fons there by name, with their bodies and all that belonged to them (cum eorum 
corporibus et eorum fequelis), during the life of the faid Roger.
So that they 
feem to have been drudges, to perform the moil fervile and laborious offices.
And of thefe Roger had great ufe at Brougham ; for of him the countefs of 
Pembroke's memoirs take notice, that he was a lover of building, and a great 
repairer of his ancient caftles, the feats of his anceftors.
They feem to have 
been tenants in pure villenage, who were bound to the lord as members of 
and annexed to the manor, and were ufually fold with the farm to which they 
belonged.
And it was in contradistinction to thefe, that the others were called free.
Which obfervation ought efpecially to be noted, otherwife we fhall fall into 
great confufion in abundance of inftances.
For wherever free men, free te- 
nants, or free holders are mentioned of old time, by thefe are not to be un- 
derflood what we now call freeholders, but only that they were not villains or 
bondmen.
All our military anceftors within the feveral cuftomary manors are 
ftyled free tenants, but the lands were not freehold, according to the modern 
acceptation of that word.

And 
22 OF WESTMORLAND IN GENERAL: 
And the very identical record, on which Sir Henry Spelman grounds his 
opinion, feems to make againft him.
" Behold," fays he, " the very origin 
" of the matter (if I do not deceive myfelf) from an old manufcript of the 
" family of Sharnburn in Norfolk, which I fome time ago fortunately met 
Â«' with.
Edwin de Sharnburn, and fome others, who were ejected out of 
" their lands, went to the Conqueror and told him, that never before the 
â–  conqueft, nor in the conqueft, nor after, were they againft the king in 
" counfel and aid, but held themfelves in peace.
And this they are ready to 
** prove, as the king mail ordain.
Whereupon the faid king caufed inquiry 
" to be made all over England, if it was fo.
Which was proved.
Where- 
" fore the king commanded, that all they who fo held themfelves in peace in 
** form aforefaid, mould have again all their lands and poffeffions, as perfectly 
" and in peace as ever they had or held the fame before his conqueft.
And 
" that thereafter they fhall be called Drenges." â€” From which, the moft na* 
tural inference feemeth to be, that they fhould hold their lands, not by 
knights fervice, for they had done no act of military achievement in the 
Conqueror's behalf, as his faithful Normans had done â€¢, but that they fhould 
hold their lands by tenure of villenage, in peace and without disturbance, but 
not in the fame degree of confidence and military employment, as thofe who 
had exerted themfelves for his caufe in the field f.
Alfo in the tenures of many of the manors, there were certain fervices re- 
flecting the forests â€¢, as, to keep aireys of hawks for the lord's ufe, to herd 
the lord's hogs during the maftage feafon, to watch with nets or dogs at fuch 
a ftation : More particularly, there are two fervices that occur frequently, ta 
wit, to find puture of the forefters, and witnefman.
Puture, Sir Edward Coke explains as fignifying poiure, or drinking.
It 
was a demand made by the officers of the foreft, within the circuit of their 
perambulation, of all kinds of victuals for themfelves, their fervants, horfes,.
and dogs.
Others, who call it pulture, explain the word as fignifying a de- 
mand in general ; and derive it from the monks, who before they were ad- 
mitted, pulfabant, that is, knocked at the gates for feveral days together.
Of the word witnesman, no etymologift, or other author that we have 
met with, hath given any account.
Jt is frequently found by the inquifitions, 
that fuch a man, being lord of a manor, was obliged to find to the forefters 
witnefman.
And amongft the privileges granted to the mefne lords or their 
tenants, mention is made of freedom from finding to the forefters witnefman.
In order to form a probable conjecture concerning this matter, it feemeth 
that we mult go back to the ftatute of Magna Charta.
Before that ftatute, 
by the abufesof the King's officers and others, people were put to their waging

fay?, that although this record was ab'e 
to impofe on fuch able antiquarians as Spdman and Dugdale, yet Dr. Brady has proved it to be a 
forgery.
But whether it is a forgery or not, is not material as to the fuppofed meaning of the word 
drenges.

of law, upon the bare furmife of fuch officers, without other teftimony.
This waging of law was, that the defendant fhould clear himfelf by the oath 
of 12 perfons, viz.
himfelf abfolutely, and 1 1 others, of their belief that what 
he fwore was true.
Now by the ftatute of Magna Charta, c.
28.
it is enacted, 
" That no bailiff (or other officer) fhall put any man to his open law, nor ta 
" an oath, upon his own bare faying, without faithful witneffes brought in 
" for the fame." In purfuance hereof, the lords of the forefts, making a 
virtue of neceffity, granted to the mefne lords holding under them, that they 
would not put any man upon his trial by waging of law for offences within 
the foreft, upon the fole accufation of the verderers or other officers without 
other teftimony.
But at the fame time, they had no power to fummon any 
perfons either as witneffes or jurymen that inhabited out of the limits of the 
foreft ; for by the ftatute of Charta de Forefta, chap.
2. (which was made in 
the fame year as the other called Magna Charta) " Men dwelling out of the 
" foreft were not to be fummoned before the juftices of the foreft, unlefs ac- 
" cufed of fome trefpafs therein, or as fureties for other offenders ;*' therefore 
the lords of the foreft required at the fame time of the faid mefne lords, that 
they fhould caufe the tenants within their jurifdiction to appear in the foreft 
courts, and give teftimony to the truth either as jurors or witneffes, or in other 
words to find unto the forejlers witnefman.
Thus John de Veteripont, fon of the firft Robert, grants to the lords of 
the manors of Sandford, Burton, Helton, and Warcop, and their tenants, 
freedom from pulture of the forefters ; and from all things that he or his heirs, 
or his forefters, by occafion of the faid pulture, might demand by the tefti- 
mony of his verderers or other officers in the foreft : And if any forfeiture 
fhould happen by reafon of any trefpafs within the foreft; that the forefters 
fhould apply to the lords of the faid manors, and demand of them witnefman: 
And that the lords fhould find unto the forefters witnefman: And that every 
forefter fhould fwear, upon the entrance into his office, that he would hurt 
no man by the occafion of fuch teftimony *.
In reality, the holding of foreft courts, the faid forefts being in the hands 
of fubjects, was intirely an ufurpation ; and the lords of Weftmorland, being 
alfo fheriffs of the county, drew the foreft caufes into their county court.
Thus 
the fame John de Ve.teripont grants to the men of Kirkby Thore, that they 
fhall be free from pulture of the forefters, and from finding teftimony to the 
forefters, which is called witnefman: And if the forefters fhall find within 
their bounds a manifeft offence of vert or venifon ; the offenders fhall not be

called to account for the fame, but only in his county court of Weftmor- 
land *.
Upon which grant Sir Matthew Hale's oblervation is very remark- 
able : He fays, it was altogether an incroachment of the great lords to draw 
thefe caufes into the foreft courts ; for they were not enabled by law to hold 
fuch courts, thefe forefts in the hands of fubjecls being but chafes.
And he 
fays, trefpafs of vert and venifon were determinable either by a fpecial com- 
miflion, or by action at common law : But the lords of Weftmorland, having 
their own county court, and not being enabled to hold iwainmote courts, drew 
the prefentments for thefe offences into their county court.
In fome places, this obligation of finding to the forefters ivitnefman was con- 
verted into a pecuniary compenfation.
Thus in the 7 Hen. 7.
in a rent roll 
of the crown lands within the barony of Kendal, whereof Sir Thomas Strick- 
land was then fteward, there is a payment of 2 s yearly by the tenants of 
Thornton, to the bailiff of the manor of Burton, by the name of witnefs- 
fifoer.
By cuftom within the barony of Kendal, the widow enjoys the whole cut 
tomary eftate during her widowhood ; or, as others fay, during her chajle vi- 
duity.
Whether fuch diftinction ought to be admitted, cuftom hath not efta- 
blifhed.
To the honour of the fex, there is no inftance upon record, that 
we know of, wherein that matter hath been contefted.
And in the furvey 
which was made by order of queen Elizabeth in the 16th year of her reign 
(as will hereafter appear) this diftinction is not taken notice of; it being there 
expreffed, that " me fhall enjoy her hufband's tenement during her widow's 
" eftate" And in the decree which fettled the cuftoms in all the crown ma- 
nors in the reign of king James the firft, the words are, that " fhe fhall enjoy 
" her hufband's cuftomary eflates during her widowhood." 
And for this widow's eftate is due to the lord an heriot ; which, as the 
widow could not go to war, was a recompence, in order to provide things ne- 
ceffary for the marching of the army ; as the word heriot imports, being of 
Saxon original, derived of here, an army, and yate or gate, a march or expe- 
dition.
And this heriot was anciently the beft bead of the deceafed.
In fbme 
manors cuftom hath obtained, for the lord to have the beft of the quick or 
dead goods at his option.

Tn fome places alfo are claimed parcel heriots, that is, an heriot for every par- 
cel of land acquired to the original eftate.
This perhaps fhould mean, for every 
ancient military tenement, upon this reafon, that if a man purchafeth two te- 
nements, which before paid two heriots, the lord (hall not lofe his benefit by 
thofe tenements coming into one perfon's hands.
This diftinction of tene- 
ments, though feveral of them be now enjoyed by one perfon, yet is ftill kept 
up in many places, thofe eftates being called emphatically by the name of 
Ancients, which refpecls particularly the ancient manfion-houfe, or place where 
that houfe ftood ; for which the owners ferve feparately and diftinctly the of- 
fice of conftable, and other like offices.
But in none of the inquifitions or 
other evidences that we have met with, is this diftinction taken notice of; but 
they run all in the ftyle of one heriot to be paid by one perfon.
In the furvey 
of the Marquis Fee, made by order of the Marchionefs of Northampton, in 
the 14th year of the reign of queen Elizabeth, the words are, " By the death 
** of the tenant, the wife payeth a heriot." In queen Elizabeth's furvey of the 
Richmond Fee, in the 16th year of her reign as aforefaid, the commifiloners 
return, that " on the death of the tenant, the lord is to have the beft beaft being 
" upon the tenement, of which beaft the tenant died feifed as of his own pro- 
'* per goods, in the name of the heriot" And in the fettlement of the cuftoms 
in the reign of king James the firft abovementioned (for the confirmation of 
which cuftoms the tenants paid a valuable confideration, as will hereafter ap- 
pear) the words are, " Upon the death of every tenant dying feifed of a tene- 
** ment, leaving a widow behind him, an heriot ((hall be paid) ; for which fhe 
" is to enjoy her hufband's cuftomary eftates during her widowhood only." And 
in all antiquity we have not met with more than one heriot paid by one perfon.
On the contrary, the fecond beft horfe was due to the church, and was carried, 
by the name of mortuary or corfe prefent, before the corps, and delivered to 
the prieft at the place of fepulture *.
In the bottom of Weftmorland, the widow has in fome places half, and in 
others only one third, of her hufband's cuftomary eftate ; and in that part of 
the county not many heriots are paid : for in thofe cafes there is an heir at law, 
who enters immediately ; and confequently the lord did not want a foldier, or 
if the heir was under age, the lord had the wardihip of his lands* 
* In the diocefe of Carlifle it feemeth that the church was to be firft ferved, and the lord had 
only the fecond beft ; as appears from the following entry in the regifter of Wetheral priory: " Be 
" itknawen to all manner of men that this prefent wrytinge fhall fe or here, Thatl Thomas Bamp-

In a fmall manufcript by one Ifaac Gilpin, whofe father had been fteward of 
feveral manors within the barony of Kendal, and died about the year 1630, 
at the age of 92 years â€¢, he fays, he had heard of his father, and had obferved 
the fame himielf, that by general cuftom within the faid barony, if a woman 
hath an eftate and marries, hereby the eftate is fo far vefted in the bujband, 
that he may fell it in his lifetime â€¢, but if in his lifetime he doth not alter the 
property, then it fhall continue to her and her heirs.
And Mr. Machel fays, he heard this cuftom proved at the affizes at Appleby 
before judge Dolben, Aug. 29, 1690 ; that if a man marries an heirefs, or a 
woman who hath purchafed lands before marriage, he is intitled thereupon to 
be admitted tenant, and may aliene the land to whom he pleafeth.
But it did 
not appear (as the judge obferved) that it was fo, where lands fall to a feme- 
covert or are given to her after marriage.
The faid Mr. Gilpin obferves further â€¢, that generally a fine is due uporr 
change of the lord by death, and change of the tenant by death or alienation : 
The one called a general, the other a fpecial or dropping fine.
But as to the general fine, there is this exception, where a man purchafeth 
the manor and dieth, the former lord being yet living.
In that cafe, there is 
no fine due upon the death of the purchafing lord, nor of his fon or other de- 
fcendent or aflignee, fo long as the laft general admitting lord is living â€¢, but 
upon the death of the laft general admitting lord, it hath been determined that 
a fine fhall be paid to the lord then in poffeffion.
A fine arbitrary or uncertain (he fays) is loft, if the tenant dies before it is 
affeffed by the lord, and demand thereof made.
But in moft of the manors, to prevent endlefs altercations, the fines have 
been reduced to a certainty ; and in others extinguished, and the eftate pur- 
chafed to freehold.
Befides rent, fines, heriots, fuit of court, and the like dependencies, there 
are likewife boons, which vary in the feveral manors â€¢, as, to pay a farm hen 
or capon ; to plow, harrow, mow, reap, for a certain number of days â€¢, to 
carry coals; to repair the lord's mill race ; and fuch like.
The very word 
boon implies a benignity or voluntary kindnefs ; but length of time hath riveted 
thefe fervices, and they, are become matters not of choice, but of neceflity.
In the barony of Kendal the cuftomary lands are devifable by will; but not 
fo in the bottom of Westmorland.
As for fuch as have been earls of this county, Sir Daniel Fleming obferves, 
that although it be generally affirmed, that king Richard the fecond created 
the firft earl of Weftmorland, yet there feem to have been fome earls of this 
county before; for he finds Humphrey de Baffingburne one of the knights of 
the earl of Weftmorland about the time of the conqueft.
As to the reft, the 
faid king Richard the fecond created Ralph Nevill of Raby earl of Weftmor- 
land, a man of the greateft and moft ancient birth of Englifh nobility, as 
defcended

defcended from Ucthred carl of Northumberland; whofe heirs fuccefilvely 
flourifhed in that honour, until Charles Nevill, cafting off his allegiance to 
queen Elizabeth, and covering treafon under pretext of religion, dishonoured 
that noble houfe, and in the year 1599 was forced to fly into the Low Coun- 
tries, where he ended a miferable life.
The aforefaid earl Ralph, by his wife 
Catharine daughter of John of Gaunt duke of Lancafter, had fo fair iffue, 
and the name of Nevill became thereby fo greatly multiplied, that almoft ac 
one and the fame time there flourifhed, befides the earls of Weftmorland, an 
earl of Salfbury, an earl of Warwick, an earl of Kent, a marquis Montacute, 
a duke of Bedford, a lord Latimer, and lord Abergavenny, all Nevills.
Francis Fane, eldeft fon of Mary lady Defpencer, defcended from the Nevills 
earls of Weftmorland, was by king James the firft created earl of this county - t 
in which family the honour ftill continues.
Sheriffs of this county, before the grant of the fheriffwick in fee to Ro- 
bert de Veteripont, fo far as we have been able to trace them, are as follows :

So much concerning Weftmorland in general.
In treating of the two 
great divifions thereof, it feemeth requifite to begin.
with the barony of Ken-

heretofore it extended to feveral places within the bottom of Weftmorland - y .

3 o BARONS OF KENDAL; 
CHAPTER I.
Of the Barons of Kendal before the divifion of the inheritance.
CHAP.
1 I.
IVO de Talebois, brother to Fulk earl of Anjou, came in with William 
!â€¢ J[ the conqueror : Unto whom the conqueror gave that part of Lancafhire 
*"-"~^ which adjoins unto Weftmorland, and fo much of the county of Weftmorland 
as is now called the barony of Kendal.
And hence this Ivo is ftyled the firft 
baron of Kendal.
His eftate extended into feveral parts of the bottom of 
Weftmorland.
He gave the church of Kirkby Stephen to the abbey of St.
Mary's York.
The manors of Barton, Patterdale, Hackthorp, Melkanthorp, 
and Morland, appear to have belonged to that family.
He gave alfo all the 
churches in the barony of Kendal to the faid abbey *.
II.
Eldred, or Elthred, fon of Ivo, the fecond baron of Kendal, 
III.
Ketel, fon of Eldred.
Unto whom, William Mefchiens, brother to 
Ranulph de Mefchiens lord of Cumberland, gave feveral places in Cumberland ; 
and, amongft the reft, a place which from him received the name of Kelton 
(or Ketelton).
Whether the divifion of the manor of Strickland in the barony 
of Kendal was made in his time, or afterwards, hath not appeared.
The de- 
nominations of Strickland Ketel and Strickland Roger moft probably were received 
from this family.
This Ketel fon of Eldred gave to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York 
the church of Morland, and two carucates of land there ; which grant was con- 
firmed by Athelwold and Hugh bifhops of Carlifie.
(Regijier of Wetherel.) 
The faid Ketel had three fons ; Gilbert, the elded, who fucceeded as baron 
of Kendal: Another fon Orme, who was founder of a family that is not yet 
extinct.
Which Orme had a fon Gofpatric, who had a fon Thomas, which 
Thomas fon of Gofpatric was founder of Shap abbey, and from him are de- 
fcended in a regular fuccefiion of the male line (taking in collaterals fometimes 
to exclude the female defcent) the prefent family of the Curwens of Working- 
ton.
All the pedigrees of the Curwen family that we have met with do exprefs, 
that Orme was fon of Ketel, fon of Eldred, fon of Ivo. But none of thefe take 
notice that he was a younger fon ; which hath caufed fome confufion.
That 
he was fon of Ketel, there feems to be no doubt.
So he is exprefsly ftyled in 
the record of a plea in the 6 Ed. I.
wherein it is fet forth, that Gofpatric fon 
* Moft of the particulars relating to thefe barons are taken from Sir William Dugdale's 62 vo- 
lumes of records, as extracted by Mr. Machel, and frcm Sir Daniel Fleming's cbpies or extracts of 
records and other evidences.
Ingulf, fpeaking of the depredations made or permitted by the Conqueror, fays, that Ivo de 
Taillebois plundered the monaltery of Cioyland of a great part of its lands, and no redrefs could be 
obtained.
(Hume's Hift.
of Engl.
vol.
i. p.
179.) 
I Of 
BARONS OF KENDAL.
Â©f Orme fon of Ketel gave Salter in Cumberland to the abbey of St. Mary's 
York.
And that he was not the eldeft fon is very clear; lor the inheritance 
of the barony of Kendal defcended to Gilbert fon of Ketel fon of , Idred fon of 
Ivo. â€” The name of Ketel 's other fon was William^ as appears from t e attefta- 
tion of his grant of the church of Morland aforefaid to the faid abbey ; from 
which alfo appears that his wife's name was Chrijiian : " Tejiibus, Chrijliana 
'* uxore mea, Willielmo filio meo, et mult is aliis." 
IV.
Gilbert, fon of Ketel, fourth baron of Kendal.
V. William de Talebois, fon of Gilbert, was the firfl: who (by licence 
of king Henry the fecond) took the name de Lancastre.
He was a great 
benefactor to many religious houfes ; as, to St. Bees, Furnefs, Cockerfand, 
St. Leonard's nigh Kendal, and others.
And he founded the priory of Co- 
nyngfhead.
He married Gundred countefs of Warwick, daughter of William 
earl of Warrene ; and by her had ifiue, 
VI.
WiLLrAM de Lancastre the fecond.
He was fteward to king Henry 
the fecond.
This William gave to one Hugh the hermit, a certain place called Afkele- 
ros and Croc, to look to his fifhing in the river Loyn.
The faid William fon of William gave to the King 30 marks, that he might 
have a duel with Gofpatric fon of Orme â€¢, which fum was accounted for in the 
exchequer by the fheriff Elias fon of Gilmichael aforefaid.
He married Helwife de Stutevile, by whom he had only a daughter, named 
after her mother Helwife.
So that here the direct male line failed, and the 
inheritance was transferred by a daughter into another family.
VII.
This Helwise, daughter and heir of the faid William de Lancqftre the 
fecond, was married to Gilbert Ion of Roger Fitz-Reinfred.
Which 
Roger Fitz-Reinfred was one of the judges of the court of king's bench, and 
likewife juftice itinerant, and fheriff of SmTex from the 23d to the 33d of 
Hen. 2.
and of Berks in the 34 Hen. 2.
and 1 Ric. 1.
To this Gilbert, king Richard the firft, in the fifft year of his reign, granted 
the whole foreft of Weftmerland and of Kendale and of Furneife, to hold to 
him and his heirs as fully and freely as William de Lancaftre and Nigel de 
Albiny had held the fame: And granted alfo, that what had been walte in the 
woods of Weftmerland and Kendale, in the time of the faid William, fhould.
be fo ftill ; except the purprefture made by licence and confent of the lords 
of the fee of Kendale and of Weftmorland.
The faid king granted to him alfo in the fame year a quittance, through all 
his lands of Weftmerland and of Kendale, from noutegeld; and from fuit to the 
fhire, hundred, or trithing courts, and aid to the fheriff or his bailiffs -f .

This Gilbert alfo procured from the faid king a charter for a weekly market 
at Kendale on Saturday.
Another grant he had from the faid king of lands 
in Levenes, Farleton, Detene, Prefton, Holme, Berton, Henecaftre, and 
Loppeton, with the fifhery belonging to the faid lands, and all other liberties 
and privileges *.
The faid Gilbert granted to Thomas fon of Gofpatric certain lands in Holme, 
Prefton, and Hoton.
WitnefTes of which grant were, Roger fon of Reinfred, 
Hugh de Morville, Gilbert de Lancaftre, Gervafe de Aincourt, Roger de 
Bellocampo, and others.
The flrft witnefs to the charter of Robert de Veteripont of the fite and de- 
mefne lands of the abbey of Shap, is this fame Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz- 
Reinfred.
The faid Gilbert adhered fo far to the rebellious barons in the time of king 
John, that he was forced to pay a fine of 12,000 marks in the 17th year of 
that king.
Upon which he obtained a pardon, as alfo that William de Lan- 
caftre his fon, Ralph de Aincourt and Lambert de Bufiy his knights, fhould 
be freed from their imprifonment, having been taken in Rochefter caftle by the 
king.
Neverthelefs, he was not fo far trufted, as to be at liberty without giv- 
ing divers hoftages for his own future fidelity, and for the fidelity of William 
his fon â€¢, viz.
Benedict fon and heir of Henry de Redman, the heir of Roger 
de Kirkby his daughter's fon, the fon and heir of William de Windlefore, the 
daughter and heir of Ralph d'Eincourt, the daughter or fon and heir of Roger 
de Burton, the daughter and heir of Adam de Yelond, the fon or daughter of 
Thomas de Bethun, the fon or daughter and heir of Walter de Stirkland, the 
daughter of Richard de Coupland, and the fon of Gilbert de Lancaftre.
He died in the fourth year of king Henry the third, leaving one fon, who 
fucceeded him, and three daughters.

de Lancaftre the fecond.
He rook the name de Lancaftre^ together with 
inheritance, from his mother.
He married Agnes de Brus : by whom he had no ifiue.
He was juftice itinerant for the county of Cumberland, in the 10th year of 
king Henry the third ; and was IherirTof Lancafhire from the 18th to the 30th 
year of that king.
This William confirmed to Patric fon of Thomas fon of Gofpatric the afore- 
faid grant made by Gilbert father of the faid William, of lands in Holme, 
Prefton, and Hoton.
WitnefTes of which confirmation were, Gilbert de Kirke- 
ton then fherirT of Weftmorland (that is, under-fheriff" to the then Robert de 
Veteripont), Matthew de Redeman then fenefchal (that is, fteward, or re- 
corder) of Kendal, Ralph de Aincourt, Alexander de Windefore, Richard de 
Prefton, Robert de Laiburne, Robert de Kerneford, Gilbert de Witeby clerk, 
and others f.
For the health of his foul, and the foul of Agnes his wife, he gave to the 
monks of Furnefs one boat to be ufed on Wynender-mere, for carriage of 
timber and other commodities â€¢, and one other boat, to fifti in that mere.
The faid William de Lancaftre the third gave to one Laurence de Cornewall 
and his heirs the mills at Ulverfton and certain lands there.
Which Laurence 
begat John, and John begat Laurence, which Laurence (becaufe he had no 
heirs of his body) gave the fame to Edmund Nevill and his heirs.
Which 
f Tlve Sheriff is of.en mentioned as a witnefs to fiich ancient grants, together with divers of the 
principal gentlemen of the county.
And the reafon is, bec3ufe thefe matter?, for the greater no- 
toriety thereof, were frequently tranfacled in the county court; which in ancient time was the 
court for almoit all bufintfs.
And every freeman was bound to attend, Â«nd the mefne lords hold- 
ing under the lords of Weltmorland, who alfo were fheriffs of the county, were obliged by their 
tenure to attend monthly, and did regularly attend, at the faid court.
And the law to this day, 
in many initanees, fuppoftth this general concourfe and attendance : For there the knights of the 
fhire aie elefled, as alfo coroners ; and outlawries are there pronounced, as being the place moft 
likely for the offerders to ccune to the knowledge thereof.
Subfcribing witneiTes were not ufiw!
in 
thofe days, nor till many ages after.
And therefore the writing only mentions luch and fuch rei- 
fons as witneiTes, who were generally the principal perfons for rank and diitinclion there prefent.
The truth i% very few people could then write, not even perfons of the higheft rank and eminence.
Many charters are yet extant, granted by kings and other great perfons, from which it appears that 
they could not fubferibe their names, but they figned the charters with a croft, as thus, " F.go 
*' Athelwaldus -f- fublcripfi ;" which crofs was affixed with their own hands, propter ignorantiam 
literarum (is Du Cange expieffeth it); and it is remarkab'e, that evi-n to this dav, perfons who 
cannot write ufurlly mark the writing with this lame fignacure of a crofs.
So late as the fouiteenth 
century, Du Guefclin, conftable of France, the greateif.
man in the Rate, and one of the greatefr 
men of his age, couhl neither read nor wri.e. Nor was this ignorance confined to laymen ; the 
greater part of the clergy was not many degiees fuperior to them in icience.
Many dignified 
ccclefiailics could not fubferibe the canons of thofe councils, in which they fat as members.
Alfred 
the great complained, that from the Humber to the Thames there was not a ptielt who underftood 
the liturgy in his mother tongue, or who could tranflate the eafieft piece of Latin ; and that from 
the Thames to the fea, the ccclefiailics were flill more ignorant.
This was owing, bcfides the 
ferocity of the times, to the great fcarcity of books before the invention of printing, (l Robert- 
fon's Hen. 5.
p. 232.) Such an one Clericw, doth not mean a clergyman, for thofe they ex- 
prefTed by per/cna or parfon of fuch a church ; or if not beneficed, they Ityled him capellanus ; But 
CJericus ietms molt commonly to denote the perfon who wrote the inftrumenr, Gilbert de Wateby t

He confirmed to one Alward de Broghton and his heirs the manor of

By his will he bequeathed his body to be buried in the quire of the abbey of

Agnes de Brus his wife furvived him ; and had, for part of her dower, an

The male line failing again in this William de Lancaftre the third ; we

Thefe 
were, Helwisia, married to Peter de Brus ; Alicia, married to William 
de Lyndesay; and Serota, married to Alan de Multon, who died with- 
out iflue of her body.
And therefore the inheritance defcended to the two fillers Hp; wise and 
Alice, and was divided between them ; one of whom received for her fhare 
what was afterwards called the Richmond Fee â€¢> the other, what was afterÂ«

which time he held, as found by inquifition, of the king in capitc, a moiety "â€¢ 
of Kirkeby in Kendale.
He had a fon and heir William de Lyndesaie ; on whofe death in the

Kent fifhery, and Hoton in the Hay.
This William had a fon and heir William de Lyndesay â€¢, concerning 
whom we find nothing particular, fave only that he died without any male 
heir of his body, leaving ifiue only a daughter and heir, viz.
Christian de Lyndesey, who was married to Ingelram de Gutsnes 
lord of Coucy in France.
They had a fon William, born in France, who after 
his father's death inherited his eftate there.
They had a fecond fon Ingel- 
ram, born in England, who died without any heir of his body.
And his 
brother William being an alien, and thereby not capable to inherit, the eftate 
efcheated to the crown.
The aforefaid elder brother William had two fons ; Ingelram the elder, and 
William, both of them born in France, in the ligeance of the king of France.
Ingelram enjoyed the paternal eftate there â€¢, and the king granted to William the 
younger brother his grandmother Chriftian's eftate in England.
Which Wil- 
liam alfo died without ifiue of his body, and the eftate again efcheated to the 
crown.
After which, the faid king, namely, king Edward the third, in the 21ft 
year of his reign, granted the fame to John de Coupland (of Coupland nigh 
Wooler in the county of Northumberland, and captain of Roxbrough caftle) 
and Johan his wife, during their lives, and the life of the longer liver of 
them : As follows, " The king, to whom thefe prefents fhall come, greet-

It hath been oblerved above, that the laft William had an elder brother 
Ingelram, who inherited the Coucy eftate in France.
This Ingelram had a 
ion Ingelram lord of Coucy, who married Isabel daughter of king Edward

And the king granted unto them the reverfion of the 
Englifh eftate, after the death of the faid John de Coupland and Johan his 
wife, to them and the heirs of their bodies-, except the reverfion of the moiety 
of the manor of Ulverfton, which he gave to the abbey of Furnefs.
And all this appears from an inquifition taken at Lancafter for the Lanca- 
fhire eftates (for in every different county where they had eftates there were 
different inquifitions) in the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of the aforefaid Johan

holden of John duke of Lancaftre by knights fervice and feveral rents â€¢, and 
of a moiety of the manor of Ulverfton, holden of the abbot of Furnefe by the

The jurors further find, that the faid William fon of 
William died without any heir of his body, and that he had no heir within the 
kingdom of England, or within the dominion of the king of England.
But they fay, that Ingelram de Coucy, who was of the ligeance of the king of

the manor of Kirkby in Kendale, by the fervice of one knight's fee; and that 
the fame lately belonged to dame Philippa duchefs of Ireland.

The faid king Henry the fixth, in the 22d year of his reign, granted the

male, with remainder to the crown : Which John duke of Somerfet was fon 
of John de Beaufort earl of Somerfet, fon of John of Gaunt duke of Lan-

The aforefaid Margaret countefs of Richmond was mother to the faid king 
Henry the feventh ; and from her this Richmond fee came again to the crown.
King Henry the eighth, in the 23d year of his reign, granted the fame to 
his natural fon Henry duke of Richmond and Somerset ; who dying with- 
out any iffue of his body, the fame reverted the eighth time to the crown.
The Marquis fee efcheated not long after, firft by attainder, and after- 
wards for want of heirs of the body of the laft grantee ; and both have con- 
tinued in the crown ever fince, and have commonly pafled together by tem- 
porary grants ; as will appear in due courfe, when we have brought up the 
marquis fee through the feveral pofieflbrs till its return into the hands of the 
crown.
CHAPTER III.
Of the Marquis Fee.
AVING deduced the Lindfey moiety of the barony of Kendal, which 
came to that name and family by the marriage of Alice one of the fitters 
and coheirs of the laft William de Lancaftre baron of Kendal; we proceed 
â€¢to the other lifter and coheir before mentioned, namely, Helwise who was 
married to Peter de Brus, fon of Peter de Brus, fon of Adam de Brus, fon of 
Adam de Brus, fon of Robert de Brus knight, who came in with William the 
Conqueror.
Unto which Robert, for his extraordinary fervices, the conqueror 
gave 43 lordfhips in the Eaft and Weft Ridings of the county of York, and 
51 in the North Riding.
Of the younger branch of this family was Robert 
de Brus (or Bruce), who in the reign of king Edward the firft was competitor 
with John Baliol for the crown of Scotland.
This Peter de Brus, of whom we fpeak, being the fecond of that -name, 
had by his faid wife Helwife a fon Peter de Brus, who fucceeded his father 
and mother in their inheritance; and four daughters, viz.
1. Margaret, mar- 
ried to Robert de Rofs.
2. Agnes, married to Walter de Fauconberge.
3. Lucy, 
married to Marmaduke de Thweng.
4. Laderine, married to John de Bellew (or 
de Bella-aqua).
Peter de Brus the third, fon of Peter and Helwife, after his mother's 
death, fucceeded to a moiety of the barony of Kendal.
This Peter confirmed to the free burghers of his moiety of Kirkby in Ken- 
dale, all the liberties and free cuftoms which they had of the gift of Vv il- 
liam de Lancaftre his uncle.
In the 44 Hen. 3.
he granted to William de Pickering the manor of Kil- 
lington.
He died in the 7 Ed. 1.
feifed, as the inquifition finds, of a moiety of the 
manor of Kirkeby in Kendale ; and as parcel thereof, of the caftle, with the 
parks, vivaries within the parks, and herbage therein of the yearly value of 
ten 
BARONS OF KENDAL, 4 r 
ten marks.
And the jurors further find, that he died without any heir of his 
body ; and that Margaret, //gnes, Lucy, and Lade.rine, were his filters and coheirs.
The arms of Brus were ; Or, a faltire Gules, a chief of the lafl.
Upon his death, a partition of the Lancaflre and Brus eflates was made 
amongft the faid four fillers.
And in the n Ed. i.
there is a writ to the 
cfcheator beyond Trent, to take the inheritance of Peter de Brus back into 
the king's hands, till another partition be made, if Walter de Fauconberghe 
(hufband of Agnes), who was abfent at the time of the partition, is not fatif- 
ficd therewith.
The fhare of Margaret the eldeft filter is that only which we are concerned 
with at prcfent.
Agnes, the fecond fifter, had no fhare in Weftmorland.
Lucy, 
the third fitter, had that which is now called the Lumley-fee.
And Laderine, 
the fourth lifter, had Kentmere, and nothing elfe in Weftmorland.
Margaret's fhare upon the partition is thus defcribed, viz.
Kendal caftle, 
with all in Kendale which had been Peter's, and whatfoever belonged to the 
faid Peter in demefnes, villenages, rents, and fervices of free men and others ; 
except the vill of Kentmere, which was afligned to Laderina.
And there was 
a difpute whether the advowfon of the church of Warton in Kendale belonged 
to Margaret by virtue of this partition of the eftate ; and it was determined 
for her, in the 17 Ed. r.
This Margaret de Brus was married as aforefaid to Robert de Ross (or, 
as it was moft commonly written, Rtos).
He was younger fon of Robert lord 
Roos of Hamlake and Werke, by his wife Ifabel daughter of the king of 
Scots.
The elder brother was William lord Rocs of Hamlake and Werke, 
father of William lord Roos, father of John lord Rcos, father of William lord 
Roos of Belvoir, one of whofe daughters and coheir?, Elianor, was married to 
Sir Robert Manners anceftor of the prefent duke of Rutland^ who ftill retains 
amongft his other titles that of baron Rcfs of Hamlake.
This Robert de Roos, hufband of Margaret, died in the 2 Ed. 1.
before her 
brother Peter.
Hence the partition of the eftate is fet forth to have been be- 
tween Margaret de Rcfs and the bit/bands of the three other fillers ; viz.
Walter 
de Fauconberghe, Marmaduke de Thweng, and John de Bella-aqua.
She appears to have been living many years after the death of her hufband; 
for in the 29 Ed. 1.
lhe conveyed by fine to her fon William de Ros 2 mef- 
fuages, 31 carucates, and 45 acres cf land, 5 mills, and a moiety of 3 mills, 
in Helfington, Scaleghwayt Rig, Hoton, Hay, Stirkeland Randolphe, Green- 
erigg, Hogayl, Patton, Dilaker, and the advowfon of the hofpital of St. Leonard 
in Kirkebie in Kendale, the caftle of Kirkebie in Kendale, and the fourth part of 
the manor of Kirkebie in Kendale, and io7 zs o\d of rent, alio the rents 
of one fparhawk, of 3 pounds of pepper, 2 pounds of cumin, 1 pound of wax, 
and 12 arrows ; and two parts of one knight's fee in Burton, Manlerghe, Pref-

Queen Elizabeth, in the 23d year of her reign, granted to Ambrofc earl of 
Warwick a part of the demefne lands belonging to the caftle, by the name of 
the Park of Kendal, with divers edifices, buildings, lands, tenements, and 1 
Other premifles to the fame appertaining: To hold in focage, as of the manor 
of Eaft Greenwich.
What became further of the caftle and other demefne or park larids (for 
there were two parks, as was obferved before) we have not found,, until the 
reign of king Charles the fecond, when the fame appear to have been in the- 
hands of Sir Francis Anderton of Loftock in the county ,of .Lane after, baronet.
- 
His fan and heir Sir Charles Anderton, on his marriage with dame Margaret 
his wife, in 1685, fettled the fame to the ufe of himfelf for life, remainder to 
his firft and other fons in tail male, with, divers remainders over.
Sir Charles- 
died in 1691,.
and left \Q.\xt, Charles, James, Laurence, Francis, and Jofeph,, 
and three daughters..
Charles the fon fucceeded his father, and died without 
iflue.
Upon whofe death, James entered, and died without iffue.
Laurence, 
the third ion, became a monk..
And thereupon Francis the next brother af- 
fumed the title, and pofieifed himfelf of the family eftate; but being engaged .
in the rebellion in, 1715, and taken prifoner at Prefton, he was tried and 
attainted of treafon : He was.
pardoned as to his life, but the commifiloners of 
forfeited eftates feized all his real eftate.
And thereupon Laurence the monk- 
claimed it, infifting before the commifiioners that his brother had no right* 
Laurence, on his examination before the commifiioners, confefiing himfelf a 
monk, they decreed for the crown; for that by Laurence's profefilon he was 
dead in law, and by confequence incapable to take, and therefore the eftate 
muft immediately veft in the brother, who being attainted of treafon, the eftate 
mult be forfeited.
And thereupon a decree was made for the king;, from 
which Laurence appealed to the Delegates, who reverfed the decree fo far as 
to order that the appellant might bring an ejectment, .
and try his title at law, 
and that the decree mould not ftand in the way.
But afterwards Laurence 
conformed, and became a proteftant, and fo enjoyed the title and eftate with- 
out any further trial.
In 1723, John Huggins efquire purchafed the premifies- 
of the faid Laurence, And the faid John Huggins dying in 1735, the fame 
defcended to his brother and heir William Huggins efquire.
Which William- 
Huggins, by his will in 1761, devifed the premifles to his two fons inlaw, Sir 
Thomas Gatehoufe knight, and the reverend Dr. James Mufgraue, in truft to

As to the reft of the Richmond and Marquis fees, king James the firft, in 
the 1 2th year of his reign, granted the fame to his fon Charles prince of Wales, 
for the better maintenance and fupportation of his princely eftate.
And in this 
prince's time there was a decree in chancery, afcertaining the cuftoms of the 
feveral manors within the Richmond and Marquis fees.
The hiftory of which 
is curious and important, not only with refpect to tfeefe particular manors, but 
to other manors in the feveral counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland, and 
even to the publick affairs of the nation in general at that time.
And there- 
fore it is hoped the reader will indulge us in going to the bottom of this affair, 
and deducing the fame according to the materials now in our power, feveral 
of which, at this diftance of time, and efpecially by reafon of the confufions 
that enlued, are probably not to be met with elfewhere.
It is well known, that king James, after he had formed the refolution of 
laying afide parliaments, was diftrefled for want of money, and took all me- 
thods that he or his courtiers could contrive for the obtaining of it.
One 
fcheme, amcngft the reft, was, to take all the crown lands in the counties of 
Weftmorland and Cumberland into his own hands-, upon the pretence, that as 
border (ervice had then ceafed by the union of the two kingdoms in his royal 
perfon, the eftates were determined likewife, which the tenants held by that 
.fervice.
And (to keep himielf in countenance, as it were) he encouraged all 
the other lords of manors within the laid counties to take to themfelves the 
abfolute eftate of the feveral tenants within their refpective manors, and refufe 
to admit the heirs to their anceftors eftate.
In confequence of this doctrine, the prince of Wales, in the 16th year of 
the faid king, exhibited his bill in chancery, complaining, that the tenants 
claimed by colour of a tenant-right eftate, under certain yearly rents, to have 
an eftate of inheritance in the refpective tenements ; whereas it was conceived, 
that their eftates in the premifles -were of no fuch force in law as they pretended.
The tenants put in their anfwer.
But from the hazard of contefting with the 
king, who had the judges both of law and equity, in a confiderable degree, at 
his devotion, and Sir Francis Bacon lord Verulam prefiding then in the courc 
â€¢of chancery (who, notwithstanding his greatnefs in other refpeds, was as tame, 
fubmiflive, and obedient to orders, as any courtier could be), and at the fame 
time, a good round fum in hand appearing to be not unacceptable to the prince, 
rthe matter was compromifed, and for the fijm of 2700I.
he agreed to confirm 
unto them their cuftom, as fet forth in their anfwer: Which was in thefe 
words, " That they and their anceftors, and all thofe whofe eftates they 
" feverally and refpectively had or claimed to have in the feveral meiTuages, 
** lands, tenements, meadows, paftures, clofes, improvements, milnes, woods,

being found by the jury, and paying their God's-penny fur their feveral en- 
tries, were and are admitted tenants, and entered in the court rolls upon 
every fuch charge as tenants, upon fuch fines as aforefaid paid refpeclively." 
And on the 14 Nov. in the 17th year of the faid king, it was decreed ac- 
cordingly, " that they fhall hold.

And they chofe one Samuel Knipe to be their agent and manager.
They 
prekrred a petition to the king, to be allowed their cuftora of tenant-righr.
They alfo procured a bill to be brought into the houie of commons for the 
fame purpoie ; which bill was rejected by the commons.
And on the 23th of 
July following, the king publifned the following proclamation : 
" By the King, 
" A Proclamation againft Tenant rights.
" WHEREAS it hath been oftentimes by decrees and judgments at law- 
" declared and fettled, that tenant rights fince the mod happy union of thefe

*' in queftioning of that which is beyond all difpute, which may alfo (in re-

** upon a common purfe) open a way to turbulent and feditious attempts: 
*' We, out of our princely and never- intermitted care to avoid thefe main-

We have recited this proclamation verbatim, as it-is perhaps one of the moft 
flagrant exertions of defpotifm that is to be met with in the Englifh hiftory.
However, the tenants did not defpond.
They drew up and publifhed 
a remonftrance againft the claim of the lords-, complaining therein, that 
the landlords intended " to pull the fkins over their ears, and bray their bones 
" in a mortar : That having peaceably enjoyed their tenements fo long, it

"'are." And it was a common faying amongft them â€” " If the devil be lord, CHAP.

Upon this, the lords exhibited a bill againft them in the Mar- chamber for a 
libel ; the minutes for the draught whereof were in thefe words :

14 for tenant-right :

The aforefaid remonfbrance of the tenants was rather warm than judicious, 
deriving their title from king Brute, with other like abfurdities â€¢, never touch, 
ing upon the diftinction (which undoubtedly is the proper and true one) that 
they held their eftates by a double tenure, namely, by border fervice in par- 
ticular, and moreover by the general military tenure by which all other tenants 
in capite were obliged.
And there are abundance of inftances, when at the 
fame time that they were fubject to be called to the border fervice, they wero 
required to attend their lord in a military capacity into other parts of the 
kingdom, and not feldom into France.
But what the event was in that arbitrary court of the Star-chamber, the 
re2der (no doubt)' will have the curiofity to inquire.
And as to that, a copy 
of the record will give ample fatisfaction , which is as follows : 
" In Camera Stellata coram confilio ibidem, feptimo die Novembris, anno 
" vicefimo primo Jacobi regis.

Upon the opening of which caufc,

Whereupon CHAP,

And for that purpofe, the court hath

the fpecial charge given by the king to his judges againlt the next aflizes, as

" hold eftates of inheritance in thefe parts are, though they want divers for- 
" malities that are ufed in copyholds in thefe parts ; as they have alfo fome 
" cuftoms that are not ufed here, as in fining upon death of the lord, which 
*Â« is very beneficial to their lords, and is not ufed in thefe parts.
And though 
" it be true, that thefe tenants did border fervice in former times-, yet we are 
" of opinion, upon all that we have feen, that the border fervice was no fpe- 
" cial part of their fervices referved, or in refpect of the tenure of their lands, 
" but a duty and readinefs required of them to tend thofe occafions, as the 
" lords themfelves and all other freeholders, great and fmall, of the whole 
â€¢J country, did and ought to do, by virtue of their allegiance and fubjedtion ; 
" not by order and direction of their lords, but of the lord warden of thofe 
Â«' parts.
Neither was there ever any mention of their border fervice in their 
" admittances or other entries touching the faid eftates ; and we think fit that 
<c for ever hereafter there be no mention of tenant right or border fervice in 
<c any admittances or other writings or incidents of this kind, but a perpetual 
" oblivion made thereof according to the meaning and prefcript of his maje- 
" fty's proclamation in that behalf.
And touching the matter of fines, whe- 
" ther the fame be arbitrary or no, beeaufe we conceive that point not to be 
'f directly referred unto us by the faid orders, we forbear to deliver any opi- 
" nion of it ; and yet neverthelefs, beeaufe it appears by the laid orders, that 
*' the court has a defire to fettle an univerfal peace betwen the lords and te- 
" nants being very many and poor, and that we conceive, if this point be 
" left at large ftill as it is now, it will breed endlefs fuits amcngll them, and 
" leave them at no more quiet than they were before-, we have thought fit 
" to move this honourable courr, to recommend the fettling of the fines at 
" fome certain rate, either to fome court of juftice, or other way of mediation,

Whereupon the court hath ordered and decreed, that the point of 
" the tenants cuftomary eftates of inheritance be abiblutely ratified, confirmed, 
" and for ever fettled, according to the tenor and intent of the faid certificate : 
" And that the counfel learned both of lords and tenants of thofe feveral 
" manors do attend this honourable court, upon the fourth fitting day after 
" All Saints Day in the next term, for the fettling of the rates of the fines 
" likewife, as to equity and juftice mall appertain *." 
What was further done about afcertaining the fines, doth not appear.
Pro- 
bably nothing further was done.
But in many of the manors in this county 
(as appears by the feveral dates) compofitions were made about that time be- 
tween the lords and tenants, for reducing the tenements to a fine certain.
And in feveral of the compofitions, which were made flagrante bello, as it were, 
duriDg the time of king James, (who feems to have been in effect both judge, 
jury, plaintiff, and counfel in the caufe) there are claufes affuring and con- 
firming to the tenants their eftates, defcendable from anceflor to heir, as if the 
fame before had been nothing but a pretence.
â€” Others purchafed their tene- 
ments to freehold.
-But to proceed with the Marquis and Richmond Fees.
King Charles the fecond granted the fame in jointure to his wife queen KaÂ« 
therine, and from her they received the name of Queen's land; and not 
from queen Katherine, wife of king Henry the eighth, for fhe never had 
them, her father and brother enjoying the Marquis Fee all her time, and the 
Richmond Fee being then in grant to others.
In the 28 Cha. 2.
a rental was made of thefe fees by Sir John Otway, de- 
puty fteward of the queen, and a jury of the refpective fees, containing the 
names of the tenants within the feveral manors, and their refpective rents.
In the Marquis Fee : 
They kt down the free and other dry rents of the feveral tenants through- 
out the faid Fee, amounting in the whole to 20/ 17 s \\d.
Amongft the

CHAPTER IV.
Of the Lumley Fee.
AVING thus deduced the Richmond and Marquis Fees, which compre- 
hend near three fourths of the ancient barony of Kendale â€¢, we proceed 
to inveftigate the remaining part, moft of which goes by the name of the 
Lumley Fee.
From Margaret the eldeft of the four fillers of the laft Peter de Brus, we 
have deduced the Marquis Fee.
The fecond fitter and coheir was Agnes, married to Walter de Fauconbridge.
She had nothing in Weftmorland ; her whole fhare being in Lancafhire and 
York (hire.
The third filter and coheir was Lucy, who had for her lhare what is now 
called the Lumley fee.
She was married to Marmaduke de Thweng, lord of 
Kilcon caftle and Thweng, with divers other manors in Yorklhire, Lanca- 
fhire, and Weftmorland.
They had a fon, Marmaduke de Thweng â€¢, who in the 3 Ed. 2.
together 
with his coufin-german William de Rofs, obtained a grant of a market and 
fair atKirkby in Kendale.
He died in the 10 Ed. 2.
feiled, as the inquifition 
finds, of the fourth part of the barony of Kendale.
He was fucceeded by his fon William de Thweng, who in the 2 Ed. 3.
obtained a grant for a market at Stavele-y on Friday weekly, and a fair yearly 
on the eve, day, and morrow of St. Luke.
And in the 9th of the fame king, 
he obtained a grant of free warren in Stavely.
He died in the 14 Ed. 3.
and 
by the inquifition taken after his death, it appears what was then the Thweng 
fhare of the barony.
Which inquifition is as follows :

" That William- de Thwenge held in his demefne as of fee, on the day on 
Â« which he died, the manor of Helfington with the appurtenances, together 
" with certain lands and tenements in Kirkeby in Kendale, Crojfthwait, Stavely,

" Alfo they fay, that Robert de Twenge, parfon of the church of Warton, 
" brother of the faid William, is his next heir, and of the age of 40 years and 
*' upwards.
" In witnefs whereof, the jurors aforefaid to this inquifition have fet their 
" fealr." 
Robert de Thweng therefore, parfon of the church of Warton aforefaid, 
fucceeded his brother William.
Which Robert died in the 18 Ed. 3.
feifed of 
the premifes aforefaid, Thomas de Thweng, parfon of the church of Bethom, 
being his brother and heir.
This Thomas de Thweng died in the 48 Ed. 3.
having three fifters co- 
heirs ; the youngeft of whom had no portion in Weftmorland; the other two 
fifters, Lucy and Margaret, had this Tweng (hare of the barony between 
them.
Lucy, the eldeft of the three fifters, was married to Marmaduke de Lum- 
ley, and from hence came the denomination of the Lumley Fee. She had 
for her part the manors of Helfington, Crofthwaite and Lyth, and one fourth 
parr of the town of Kirkby in Kendale, together with the turbary of Sampool.
This ^Marmaduke de Lumley feems to have been fucceeded by Ralph de 
Lumley ; for in the 6 Hen. 4.
one fourth part of the manor of Kirkby in Ken- 
dale was taken into the king's hands by the death of Ralph de Lumley knight, 
and by reafon of the minority of Thomas Lumley fon and heir of the faid Ralph.
And it was found that John de Lumley was brother to the faid Ralph.
Thomas de Lumley, fon and heir of Ralph, died without ilfue, and-was 
fucceeded by 
John de Lumley knight (his uncle); which John died in the 10 Hen. 5.
feifed (as the inquifition finds) of one eighth part of the manor of Kirkby in 
Kendale, Thomas his fon and heir being then under age.
Concerning which Thomas, by an inquifition of knights fees in Weftmorland 
in the 6 Hen. 6.
it was found, that Thomas Lumley then in ward to the 
king, fon and heir of John Lumley knight deceaied, held of the kingz'w capite 
a moiety of all thole lands and tenements in Kendale, which fometime be- 
longed to Thomas deThzveng who was parfon of the church of Betham, by the 
fervice of one fourth part of one knight's fee; and that Walter PennarAine and 
John Ellerker held of the king in capite the other moiety, which formerly be- 
1 longed 
BARONS OF KENDAL.

longed to the faid Thomas de Thweng, by the fervice of the eighth part of one CHAP, 
knight's fee : And that Thomas de Stirkland knight held the third part of a 1V# 
knight's fee of the faid Thomas Lumley y in Helfington, Haverfham, Burton, 
Lowther, Whale, Hackthorp and Stirkland Ketel.
In the 6 Hen. 8.
John Fleming of Ridal efquire, efcheator for the king in 
the counties of Cumber!and and Weflmorland, accounted that year in the 
exchequer for 115/ ijs yd of the iffues of the manors of Kirkby in Ken- 
dale, of which George Lumley knight was feifed ; and for '224/ 9 s io^d 
of the iffues of the moiety of the barony or lordfhip of Kendale (viz.
the 
Richmond fee) of which the faid king was feifed.
Finally, John lord Lumley in the 23 Hen. 8.
exchanged his part of the 
barony with the king, for certain lands in the South.
And the faid king 
granted the fame, together with the Richmond fee aforefaid, to his natural fon 
the duke of Richmond and Somerfet; on whofe death, the fame came again 
into the hands of the king, who in the 36th and 37th years of his reign granted 
the fame to Alan Bellingham efquire and his heirs, in as large and ample 
manner, as the duke of Richmond and John lord Lumley or any of his 
anceftors held or enjoyed the fame.
Margaret the fecond daughter of Marmaduke de Thweng aforefaid had 
a daughter named Matilda, who was married 10 John de Hotham y who had 
with her in marriage the other moiety of the Thweng fhare of the barony, in 
Stavely and other places â€¢, being the fame which was held by Walter Pennar- 
dine and John Etterker aforefaid, as truftees probably on a fettlement.
A de- 
fcendant of Hotbam, in the 12EUZ.
granted this moiety to Alan Belling- 
ham efquire, grandfon of the foregoing Alan Bellingham , which coming into 
the fame name and family with the Lumley part before mentioned, the whole, 
though improperly as to this latter part, hath fince commonly gone under the 
name of the Lumley Fee.
By an inquifttion after the death of this later Alan Bellingham efquire, in 
the 20 Eliz.
it is found, that he died feifed of the manor of Over Stavely, and 
divers meffuages and tenements and other hereditaments in Over Stavely, Ne- 
ther Stavely, Hugill, Sadgill, Refpton (with the moiety of Refpton mill), 
Fairbank, Grefmyre, Langden, Potter fell, Vowflatt, Ulthwaite, Ratherhead, 
Sabergh, Crookfell, Weft Wood, and Roger Holme (an ifland in Winan- 
dermere), with a fiihery in the waters of Winandermere, Skelefwater, and 
Grefmyre.
This Alan Bellingham had a fon Sir James Bellingham, who had a fon Sir 
Henry Bellingham, who was fucceeded by his brother Alan Bellingham efquire, 
who fold this Lumley fee to Coicnel James Grahjne, whofe daughter and heir 
Katherine was married to Henry Bowes Howard earl of Berkfhire, whofe grand- 
fon Henry Howard earl of Suffolk and Berkshire now enjoys the fame.

CHAPTER V.
Of La darin a's fhare of the Barony.
THERE remains yet one other of the four fitters of the laft Peter de 
Brus to be accounted for, namely, Ladarina, married to John de 
Bella-aqua in Yorkfhire.
It hath been (hewed before, that this Ladarina 
had Kentmere afllgned to her ; and this was all that fhe had in Weftmorland.
She had by her faid hufband John de Bella-aqua only two daughters ; $ibitta t 
married to Milo de Stapelton ; and Johan, married to Aucherus lbn of Henry.
In the 5 Ed. 2.
a partition was made in chancery of their mother's inheritance 
between thefe two daughters or their reprefentatives, to wit, Nicholas de Sta- 
pelton fon and heir of Sibilla, and J oh an the wife of Aucherus then living.
And 
amongft the particulars, the manor of Kentniire was to remain to Nicholas â€¢, and 
all the reft of the manors, mefluages, lands, and tenements, are fet forth to be 
in Lancafhire and Yorkfhire.
This family of Stapelton continued owners of Kentmere till the reign of king 
Charles the firft, when it was fold by them, as will hereafter appear.
CHAPTER VI.
Other defcendents of the Lancastres.
CHAP.
TI 7E have now deduced the whole Talebois family in the barony of Ken- 
VV dal, fo far as our materials will admit; except what relates to one 
Roger de Lancastre, who is often mentioned, and was founder of a very 
confiderable family.
Who this Roger was, is matter of curious difquifition.
It hath been Ihewed, 
that William de Lancaflre, the third and laft of that name in the direct line, 
died without ifiue, leaving his fifters coheirs.
And yet neverthelefs, this Wil- 
liam had a brother; which was this fame Roger: So William calls him in one 
of his grants to Furnefs abbey â€” Tefte Roger fratre meo.
And from hence it 
hath been concluded, that this Roger was a brother of the half blood.
And fo 
indeed he was.
But (whether by defign, or through inadvertency) it hath 
not been expreffed what kind of half brother he was.
The regifter of Furnefs 
abbey will inform us â€” " Rogerus baftardus frater Willielmi." This circum- 
ftance is not taken notice of in any of the pedigrees, which derive the name 
and family of the Lancajlres from this fame Roger -, which name and family 
flourifhed and long continued in this county, at Ridal, Sockbridge, Howgill 
caftle, and other places, and by intermarriages was connected with mod of the 
confiderable families in the county, and probably is not yet extinct, many of 
the name yet remaining, though the eftaies are palled into other hands.

This Roger de Lancajlre held, in what is now called the Bottom of Weft- 
morland, the manor of Barton, by the gift of William his brother ; as alfo 
Patterdale.
And in the 3 Ed. 1.
he obtained of that king a confirmation to 
him of the foreft of Rida], as alfo of Amellate and Loughrigge, which before 
had been granted to him by Margaret de Brus.
He was fheriff of Lanca- 
ihire in the 49 Hen. 3.
He married Philippa, one of the four daughters and 
coheirs of Hugh de Bolebeck in the county of Northumberland, and died in 
the 19 Ed. 1.
leaving ilTue, 
John de Lancajlre, who was fummoned in the 22 Ed. 1.
amongft divers 
other perfons of note, to attend at Portfmouth, well provided with horfe and 
arms, and thence to fail with his majefty to France.
In the 25th of the faid 
king, he was employed in the expedition againft the Scots, being in the retinue 
of Brian Fitz-Alane of Bedal in Yorkfhire.
He was fummoned to parliament 
from that year to the 3 Ed. 2.
and died in the 8th year of king Edward the 
third.
Amora his wife furvived him : For in the 1 1 Ed. 3.
fhe appears to 
have held the manor of Ridal for the term of her life, remainder to "John de 
Lancajlre of Holgill and his heirs, he being the next heir male of this family.
This John de Lancajlre of Howgill had a fon William ; who had a fon Wil- 
liam ; who had a fon John ; who had another John, who died without iffue 
male in the reign of Hen. 6.
leaving four daughters; 1.
Chrijlian, married to 
Sir Robert de Harrington, knight.
2. 1 fab el, married to Sir Thomas le 
Fleming of Conifton, knight.
3. Margaret, married to Sir Matthew de 
Whitfield, knight.
4. Elizabeth, married to Robert de Crackenthorp, efquire.
There was another branch of the Lancajlres at Sockbridge â€¢, which continued 
in the direct male line till the reign of king James the firlt ; and then became 
alfo extinct in daughters.
There were others in other places â€¢, all of whom will be particularly confi- 
dered in their refpective places.
PARISH AND TOWN OF KENDAL.
*npHE parifh of Kirkby in Kendale is very extenfive, comprehending 24 town-

Kendal, Helfington, Natland, Scalthwaite- 
Rigg (including Hay and Hutton in the Hay), New Hutton, Old Hutton 
and Holme Scales, Docker, Lambrigg, Grayrigg, Whinfell, Fawcet Foreft, 
Whitwell and Selfide, Skelfmergh and Patton, Burnefhead, Strickland Roger,

Underbarrow.
This parifh was anciently larger â€¢, for Windermere and Grefmere were parts

It is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Shap, Orton, Sedberg, and 
J** f Kirkby Lonfdale; on the South, by the parifhes of Kirkby Lonfdale, Burton, 
/ ~~ and Heverfham â€¢, on the Weft, by the parifhes of Heverfham and Winder-

The town of Kendal is the chief town in this county, for largenefs, neatnefs, 
buildings, populoufnefs, and trade â€¢, and is pleafantly fituate on the weftern 
bank of the river Kent, which fprings in Kentmere, and gives name to this town 
and parifh.
It deals largely in the woollen and cotton manufactures.
So early as the 
l ith of king Edward the third, the king's agents having folicited a great many 
men from the Low Countries, well fkilled in cloth-making, fent a colony of 
them (amongfl ocher places) to Kendal.
And in the reigns of Ric. 2.
and 
Hen. 4.
feveral regulations were made by act of parliament for the making of 
Kendal cloths.
Before this, all the wool of the country was exported ; which, 
being manufactured in the Netherlands, was fuch a fource of riches, as to 
occafion the duke of Burgundy to inftitute the order of the Golden Fleece.
The people of Kendal are generally induftrious, fo that it is a very rare thing 
to fee any perfon ftanding idle, as is too ufual in other thorough-fare towns, or 
other places of public refort.
The largenefs of their trade may be eftimated from the quantity of goods 
brought into and carried out of this town weekly, by the pack-horfe carriers, 
before the turnpike roads were made, when waggons came in ufe, whofe con- 
tents are not fo eafily calculated.

Here is a very large market on Saturday weekly, which was granted by 
king Richard the firft to Gilbert fon of Rcger Fitz-Reinfred before men- 
tioned f.
Afterwards, in the third year of Edward the fecond, Marmaduke de Tbzveng 
and William de Rofs (as is aforefaid) obtained a charter for a market and fair at 
Kirkby in Kendale.
And in the 7 Ed. 3, another grant of a market and fair at Kirkby in Ken- 
dale was obtained by Chrijlian wife of Ingelram de Cynes.
â€” Or rather, thefe laft 
were confirmations of the former grant.
And thefe were again confirmed by the charter of incorporation of queen 
Elizabeth in the 18th year of her reign-, and by a further charter in the nth 
of Charles the firft, confirming that of queen Elizabeth, and granting more 
ample privileges.
The fubftance of which two charters put together is as fol- 
loweth : " That in the town of Kirkby in Kendale there fhall be a body politic 
" and corporate, confifting of one mayor, 12 aldermen, and 20 capital bur- 
tc geflfes, by the name of mayor, aldermen, and burgefles of the borough of 
" Kirkby in Kendale-, to have a common feal ; with power to take lands not 
*' exceeding 100/ a year.
" The mayor to be chofen out of the number of aldermen, on Monday next 
" before Michaelmafs day yearly, by the mayor and aldermen, or the major 
" part of them (of whom the mayor to be one), to continue for one whole 
" year, and from thence until another be chofen and fworn.
" The aldermen to be chofen by the mayor and aldermen, or the major 
" part of them, to continue during life, or until amoval from the office for 
" reafonable caufe.
" The capital burgefles to be chofen by the mayor and aldermen, or the 
" major part of them (of whom the mayor to be one), to continue in the 
" office during their good behaviour.
" One man learned in the laws to be recorder or fenefchal ; to be chofen by 
*' the mayor and aldermen, to execute the office during their pleafure.
â€¢* They fhall alfo appoint a clerk of the recognizances (or town clerk) -, and 
*' a fword-beart r, and two ferjeants at mace.
" The mayor fhall be clerk of the market; and the mayor and fenior alder- 
" man fhall be coroners for the faid borough.
" If the mayor die within the year, or be lawfully amoved from his^office, 
*' another fhall be chofen for the refidue of the year.
And no mayor fhall 
" ferve again till after four years from the expiration of his office.
*' If an alderman live out of the borough, another fhall be chofen.

which were furrendered to the crown in the latter end of the reign of king 
Charles the fecond, -and in the reign of king James the fecond, thefe two 
charters fufFered the fame fate.
The hiftory of which is as follows : In the 
laft year of the reign of king Charles the fecond, the lord chief juftice Jeffreys 
was fent judge of aftize on tha northern circuit.
And all along as he pro- 
ceeded, he laboured this furrender of the charters in every corporation where 
he came.
At Kendal he fucceeded ; and there are fome copies of letters yet 
extant, 
PARISH AND TOWN OF KENDAL.
69 
extant, very characteriftic of that judge and of thofe times, in relation to the CHAP, 
obtaining a new charter for this corporation : Particularly that which here v * 
next follows ; 
To the right honourable Sir George Jeffereys knight and baronet, lord 
chief juftice of England : 
My Lord, 
IN the performance of our duty, when your lordfhip was here, in giving 
up our charter, whenfoever his majefly mould be pleafed to call for it, your 
lordfhip was pleafed to give us not only your word but your oath to become 
a buxome and beneficial member of this corporation.
This, my lord, we 
mention with all due refpec~t and thanks to your lordfhip, for the great honour 
then done us.
We have now fent up our charter, in order to lay it at his 
majefty's feet, and hope by your lordfhip's beneficence to obtain his majefty's 
royal charter, with fuch privileges and benefits de novo as your lordfhip fhall 
approve of.
'Tis not much we would defire, nor (hall defire any thing which 
your lordfhip fhall judge unfitting either for us to afk, or his majefty to grant.
But in fuch things as are feifible, we humbly beg your lordfhip's advice and 
affiftance.
My lord, we know we cannot apply ourfelves to any perfon more 
defervedly happy in his prince's favour, and in the love and honour of all good 
and loyal men.
Long may your lordfhip live and enjoy this happinefs, whilfl: 
we think ourfelves happy in having fo worthy a member of our poor corpora- 
tion.
We beg leave to fubfcribe ourfelves, as we really are, 
Your lordfhip's mod obliged humble fervants.
Another letter was addreffed to the lord keeper: 
To the right honourable Francis lord Guilford, lord keeper of the great 
feal of England.
May it pleafe your lordfhip, 
IN obedience to his majefty's defires, intimated to us by the right ho- 
nourable the lord chief juftice of England, we are now upon furrendering our 
charter into his majefty's hands ; and as your lordfhip was pleafed to honour us 
fo far as to become a member of this corporation, fo we humbly requefb your 
lordfhip's favour in relation to our new charter, and fuch privileges and be- 
nefits as we hope his majefty will be pleafed to grant us.
This, we mirft con- 
fefs, is a great prefumption in us, but beg your lordfhip's favourable ac- 
ceptance hereof, from 
Your lordfhip's molt obedient fervants.
Another letter was fent to Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave, one of the knights of 
the fhire.
Honoured Sir, 
SINCE you were pleafed to be our reprefentative to yield up our old 
charter, we do not queftion but you will fairly reprefent us to his majefty in 
order to the getting a new one, with fuch alterations and additional benefits, 
as 
PARISH AND TOWN OF KENDAL.
as fliall be approved of by yourfelf and the lord chief juftice, whofe advice and 
afiiftance we have likewife defired.
Be pleafed, Sir, to confider us as a poor 
corporation, whofe yearly revenue will fcarce defray the yearly charges there- 
of; inlbmuch that we are hard put to it to raife money for the ordinary fees 
for renewing our charter.
So that if the thorough-toll, or any other thing, 
we have defired, fhall meet with any difficulty or obftruction, we muft rather 
defift, than be put to the charges of petitions, references, reports, and the 
like : But all we can hope for (befides the confirmation of our old charter) 
muft be from yours and the lord chief juftice's immediate interceflion to his 
majefty without further charge -, for really we are not in a condition to do as 
may be expected from us on this account, being rich in nothing but as having 
fo worthy members and friends as yourfelf.
This we humbly offer to you, 
and fubfcribe ourfelves 
Your mod obliged and humble fervants.
The matters we defire may be humbly offered to his majefty's confideration 
are thefe : 
I., That his majefty would be gracioufiy pleafed to grant us his royal charter 
de novo, humbly fubmitting to whatever alterations his majefty in his great 
wifdom fliall think fit to make therein.
2. We enjoy the tolls of the market here, which we hold by leafe from the 
crown, under the yearly rent of 15 /.
We have all along managed the faid 
tolls to the bell advantage we could, and yet never made above ij I per an- 
num of them.
So that the yearly profit will not anfwer the charge of renewing 
our leafe (as we ought to do) once in ten years.
Wherefore if his majefty 
A would be pleafed to grant us the faid toll in fee farm, under the laid yearly 
rent of 15/, it would be a great eafe to the corporation, and not prejudicial 
(we think) to his majefty's intereft.
3. Thefe tolls have been anciently, almoft time out of mind, received by 
us ; yet of raw hides and apples no toll was ever taken here, in regard (as we 
conceive) that heretofore they were not worth the taking notice of.
But now 
the trade in leather and fruit being grown very conftderable, if by our charter 
orotherwife fuch power were given us as might juftify our taking x.A\ thereof, 
it would be a benefit to the corporation, and no lefs to his majefty, nor bur- 
den to the people but what they are liable to in other markets.
4. There is adjoining to the town a parcel of wafte ground, called Dob 
Freer, which is all the common of pafture that is belonging to the town, and 
is no more than a hill full of rocks and ftones.
The fee and foil thereof doth 
belong to the crown, but is of little or no advantage to his majefty, neither is 
it worth to the town above 5 / per annum, but might be of greater ufe and 
benefit to us, if his majefty were pleafed to grant us the ibil and inheritance 
thereof.
5. We repair and uphold two large bridges, and the half part of a third 
' bridge, at our own proper cofts and charges, which is a burden too heavy for 
us to bear.
But if, in confideration thereof, his majefty would be gracioufly 
pleafed to grant us a thorough-toll of one penny or halfpenny only for each 
pack 
PARISH AND TOWN OF KENDAL.
7l 
pack of goods paffing into or out of the town, it would be fome eafe and be- 
nefit to us ; and is no more than what Carlifle enjoys in a much greater mea- 
fure throughout the whole county of Cumberland, for all forts of goods and 
chattels palling into or out of the faid county.
Theft are the things we humbly offer, and if it might not be thought too 
great prefumption in us, we would humbly pray in aid the right honourable 
the lord keeper of the great feal of England and the lord chief juflice of Eng- 
land â€¢, who as they have done us the honour of being made members of our 
corporation, fo we hope will do us the favour of interceding with his majefty 
on our behalf, whilft we fhall defire nothing which may be thought in the lealt 
prejudicial to his majefty's intereft, or which he cannot willingly and eafily 
grant us but fhall thankfully acquiefce in his majefty's good-will and pleafure, 
whatfoever it fhall be.
Finally, a new charter was obtained, and on its being brought from Lon- 
don was ufhered in with much folemnity.
On the 26th of December 16^3, 
the town clerk Mr. Richard Rowlandfon, who brought the charter, was met at 
Burton by a large number of horfemen from Kendal.
And at the extremity 
of the town liberty, he was met by Mr. Lancelot Forth then mayor, the al- 
dermen, burgefTes, and many gentlemen out of the country ; where the mayor, 
kneeling and bareheaded, received the charter ; from whence it was conveyed 
to the town hall, many hundreds of the people huzzaing at the firlt delivery 
thereof, and all the way through the town, the mayor and aldermen being in 
their robes, with maces, fword, trumpets, mufick, bells ringing, and other 
rejoycings.
After the charter was read, the mayor began the king's health at 
the crofs, commonly called the Cold Stone ; and then treated the gentlemen 
nobly at his own houfe.
This new charter of king Charles the fecond doth not grant any of -the par- 
ticulars above petitioned for, but is copied for the moll part verbatim from 
that of king Charles the firft, with a few alterations, viz.
that the mayor fhall 
be chofen by the mayor, aldermen, and capital burgefTes-, â€” that on a vacancy 
of the mayoralty within the year, one of the two fenior aldermen fhall ferve 
during the remainder of the year ; â€” that they fhall hold pleas for any matter 
arifing within the borough for any fum not exceeding forty pounds ; â€” and that 
the deputy recorder fhall be a juftice of the peace (and may act as fuch in the 
abfence of the recorder) : With a claufe, as in all the new charters of thofe 
times, of refervation to the crown of a power to difplace and remove the 
mayor, recorder, aldermen, or any other corporation officers at pleafure.
But here a queftion arifes, of importance, not only to this, but to many 
other boroughs in the kingdom â€¢, namely, Which of the charters are in force ?
From what hath been already obferved, it fhould feem, that the two former 
charters on their furrender became totally void ; and that the charter of Charles 
the fecond is the only charter now valid and effectual.
And the practice in 
this borough, and in many other corporations, goeth accordingly.
But per- 
haps 
j2 PARISH AND TOWN OF KENDAL.
CHAP, haps it may be doubted, whether the reverfe of this be not the cafe, namely, 
. that the former charters are in force, and the laft void.
And the reafon of 
the doubt is this : When king James the fecond found matters declining, and 
that this garbling of corporations was one particular heavy charge againft him, 
he publifhed a proclamation, thereby revoking the new charters, and re-efta- 
bliming thofe which had been furrendered ; fetting forth, that whereas feveral 
of the deeds of furrender of corporations which had been lately made were 
â€¢not recorded and inrolled, and the rules for judgment which had been ob- 
tained againft other of the corporations upon Quo Warrantos or informations 
in the nature of Quo Warranto were not yet entered upon record â€¢, which faid 
deeds of furrender, or rules for judgment, being not recorded, do not amount 
to a furrender in law, nor diffblve the corporation ; the king therefore reftores 
all the faid corporations into the fame ftare and condition as they were be-fore 
fuch furrender, or rule for judgment obtained; and revokes all the new char- 
ters granted in the reign of his brother or of himfelf *.
And the rule of law 
feems to be, that the furrender of a charter without inrollment is void, and a 
new charter granted in confideration of a void furrender is alfo void.
As was 
refolved in the cafe of Bully and Palmer, Mich.
lolVill.
3. And the fame 
doctrine was held by the court in the cafe of Piper and Dennis in the fame 
term 7.
Amongft the tradefmen in this corporation, there are feven companies ; viz.
of mercers, fhearmen, cordwainers, tanners, fkinners, taylors, and barbers-, 
each of which companies hath two wardens chofen yearly, and fworn to fee the 
rules and orders of the refpeclive companies duly obfcrved.
They have a very elegant town hall, lately repaired by the corporation at a 
confiderable expence, where they hold their courts ; and the quarter feflions of 
the peace are likewife commonly held there by adjournment from Appleby at 
Michaelmafs, Chriftmafs, and Eafter ; and originally, at Midiummer every 
fecond year.
They have a court of conference by virtue of an aft of parliament of the 4th 
year of the reign of king George the third, for the recovery of debts under 
40 s, which extends to the whole parifh, and fuch debts are not to be fued for 
in any other court.
But the fame doth not extend to debts for rent, nor to 
any contract where the freehold doth come in queftion, nor to any matter cog- 
nizable by the ecclefiaftical court, or before juftices of the peace.
Adjoining to the town of Kendal on the South, is Kirkland, which is com- 
monly reckoned part of Kendal, but it is a diftinct townfhip, feparated from

the town of Kendal by a little brook, which having but a fmall current, and 
as it were feeking a paffage, is called Blindbeck.
This place, being out of the mayor's liberty, is much reforted to by tradef- 
men that are not free of the corporation.
The church of Kendal ftands in Kirkland, from whence the place hath re- 
ceived its name.
It is a very large, near, and handfome building, and con- 
tains every Sunday as large a congregation, as almoil any parifh church in the 
kingdom.
It is 180 feet long, and 99 feet in breadth ; with five alleys, each 
of them being parted by a row of 8 fair pillars ; and with a llrong fquare 
fteeple, wherein are 6 large and very tunable bells.
It is a vicarage, in the patronage of Trinity college in Cambridge â€¢, valued in 
the king's books at 99/ 5s od, in Henry the eighth's time-, which is a very 
high valuation, and the reafon feems to be, becaufe a confiderable part of the 
vicar's revenue confifts of prefcriptive payments in money, which were the 
fame then as they are now â€¢, whereas where the revenue depends upon the 
prices of the produce of land and of other things tithable, the valuation be- 
twixt that time and the prefent will be more difproportionate.
The great 
tithes, and alfo the tithes of wool and lamb, belong to the college.
This church, together with divers others, was given by Ivo de Talebois, 
firft baron of Kendal after the conqueft, to the abbey of St. Mary's York.
And the grant thereof was confirmed by Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred*.
And afterwards, the fame was appropriated to that abbey, as appears by an 
inquifition of Ad quod damnum, taken at Appleby before the fheriffon Thurf- 
day next after the Epiphany in the 30 Ed. 1.
whereby it was found, That it 
is of no damage to the king or any other, to appropriate the church of Kirkby 
in Kendale to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York : That the faid church 
is in the patronage of the faid abbot and convent ; but that its chapels, viz.
of Grefmere and Windermere, are in the patronage of Sir Ingram de Gynes 
and Chriftian his wife as heirefs, who hold the fame of the king in capite, 
(Machelfrcm Dugd.) 
After the diffolution of the monafteries, this rectory (with the advowfon of 
the vicarage) was granted to the faid college by queen Mary in the firft year 
of her reign : Who having called together the chief of the popifh clergy that 
were then about the court, conlulted with them concerning publick prayers

cafe not to be fo defperate, but that his foul might be benefited thereby.
They poffeffed her of the impoffibility thereof, and that his Holinefs would 
never confent fuch an honour to be done to one dying fo notorious a fchifmatic.
But they advifed her, in expreffion of her private affection to her father's me- 
mory, to add fomething to Trinity college in Cambridge, as being the beft 
monument he had left â€¢, whereon, chiefly at the inftance of John Chriftopher- 
fon bilhop of Chichefter who had been mafter there, fhe bellowed this and 
other advowfons upon the faid college, together with an annual fum of 376/ 
jos 3 d, part of which fum did arife from the rectory of this church.
(Hijlory 
of Cambr.
Univ.) 
But it feems that the college did not immediately come into poflefllon of 
this advowfon ; for the fame appears to have been in other hands fo late as the 
latter end of the reign of king James the firft, by grant probably of fome 
long term, either by the abbot and convent before the diffolution, or by the 
crown afterwards.
For by an indenture leading the ufes of a fine, in the 15th 
year of the faid king, between Thomas Lyttelton of Frankley in the county of 
Worcefter efquire, and Kathcrine his wife (daughter and fole heir of Sir Tho- 
mas Crompton of Driffield in the county of York knight), among other eftates 
therein recited, and which the faid Thomas .Lyttelton was then poffeffed of in 
the right of his wife, the following occur; viz.
" The chantry of Kirkby 
" Kendale : Three meffuages, three gardens, and three orchards ; 80 acres of 
* c arable land, 80 acres of pafture, 40 acres of meadow, 20 acres of wood, 
" and 40 acres of furze and heath, in Kirkby Kendale aforefaid.
Alio all 
M tithes whatever arifing and growing in Kirkby Kendale; together with the 
" advowfon of the church there, in the county of Weftmorland -f-.
What the chantry above mentioned was, doth not particularly appear; for 
there were feveral chantries in this church.
In the 24th year of queen Eliza- 
beth, there was a grant made by the faid queen to Sir Chriftopher Hatton and 
his heirs of the chantry of St. Anthony in the church of Kirkby in Kendale, 
and the chantry of Thomas a Becket in the faid church ; out of which, together 
with other particulars in his purchafe, he was to pay 7/ us \d a year to the 
Schooimafter of Burgh.
In the general return of the commiffioners appointed 
to inquire of colleges, chantries, hofpitals, and free chapels, in the reigns of 
king Hen. 8.
and Ed. 6.
it was certified, that in Kirkby in Kendale there was 
the chantry of Our. Lady ; Beckefs chantry ; Trinity Guild ; a ftipendiary in the 
chapel ; and four other flipendiaries.
Near unto the church, towards the North, is an houfe called Abbot-Hall; 
which undoubtedly belonged heretofore to the faid abbey.
It was rebuilt by 
the late owner George Wilfon efquire at the expence of about 8 coo/, who 
fold the fame to John Taylor efquire the prefent poffeffor.
And nigh unto the faid Abbot Hall was a chapel, near the head of Well-feke; 
from which place there is a lane which leads to the great ftreet, called Capel- 
lane (having received its name from the chapel) now corruptly called Capper- 
lane.

There was another chapel called St. Anne's chapel, which is fuppofed to have â‚¬ If- A P.
been fituate near Dockwray hall ; and at this place there was an houfe in Mr. Vi , 
Machel's time, which from the form of the windows and the fabrick thereof 
feemed to have been this fame chapel.
William Gilpin, fteward to Alan Bellingham of Levens efquire, purchafed 
of the faid Alan certain rents belonging to the faid chapel of St. Anne, of 
3/ ys 8d a year, at 30 years purchafe; and by his will, dated in the year 1561, 
bequeathed the fame to twoGilpins his relations, and to others of the neareft of 
his kindred fucceffively, to diftribute the fame to the poor in Kendal of his 
name and family for ever.
There was another chapel at the head of the Bank, upon an hill called 
Chapel-Hill, now demolifhed ; and an houfe erected upon the fite thereof, where 
the arms of Roos are very apparent in the front.
There was alfo a chapel called .All-Hallows chapel at the eaft end of Stram- 
mongate bridge now converted to a dwelling.
There was alfo an hofpital of lepers at Kirkby in Kendale ; the patronage 
whereof was given by William de Lancaftre to the priory of Conyngefheved 
in Lancafhire.
This hofpital was dedicated to St. Leonard; and was valued 
at the diflblution at 11 1 4s gd a year.
It was granted in the 38 Hen. 8.
to 
Alan Bellingham and Alan Wilfon efquires, being the fame which is now called 
Spittle, and belongs at prefent to Sir James Lowther baronet.
There are in the church four iles or quires, appropriated to diftinct families 
and.
houfes in the neighbourhood.
The outermoft on the fouth fide is called 
Parr's -, the inner on the fame fide, Strickland's â€¢, the outermoft on the north 
fide, Bellinghom's ; the inner on the fame north fide, called the Aldermens, be- 1- 
caufe the aldermen were formerly wont to fit there.
In the ile called Parr's, which belonged to the Parrs of Kendal caftle, Sir 
Thomas Parr knight is commonly fuppofed to have been interred, under a large 
tombftone without any infeription, there having been in the glafs window over 
it (until demolifhed by Cromwell's foldiers) the following diftich, 
*' Pray for the foul of Sir Thomas Parr knight, 
" Who was fquire of the body to king Henry the eighth." 
But it hath evidently appeared before, that he was not buried here, but in the 
Black Friers church in London.
Therefore, moft probably, that infeription 
was in memory only of his having caufed that window to be made of painted 
glafs.
1 hefe windows were of considerable expence : And they who caufed 
them to be put up, were folicitous oftentimes of having not only their names, 
but their arms alio painted thereon.
An inftance parallel to this, but more 
explicit, was in the church of Burgh in this county : " Orate pro anima Do- 
" mini Thomse Rud, qui iftam feneftram fieri fecit." Moft probably, under 
this ftone lies interred the body of Sir William Parr father of the faid Sir Thomas; 
for the arms on the faid tombftone are incircled with the garter, and no other 
of the family befides this Sir William, and his grandfon William marquis of 
Northampton, was dignified with that honour ; and the latter, we have found, 
was buried at Warwick.

fize in this town (the auizes being held here at that time, by reafon ot fame 
differences between Francis earl of Cumberland the then fheriff and the town 
of Appleby*) died Aug. 3.
1616, in the 57th year of his age, and was buried 
here, over whom is a very fair monument, with an infeription.
Next adjoining to this ile, is that belonging ro the Stric'Jands of Sizergh ; in 
which, five of the fons of Sir Thomas Strickland knight lie buried with a rich 
marble monument over them.
The Bellingham ile was fo called from the Bellinghams of Over Levens; in 
which is an handfome tomb, wherein lies interred Alan Bellingham efquire 
(great grandfather of the lafl Bellingham of that place), and over it his effigies 
cut in brafs with an infeription.
The Aider -mens : ile is that which was anciently Oar Lady's chapel.
It is faid 
to have been re-edified by Sir Roger Bellingham of Burnefhead knighr, who 
lies there interred, with his wife, in a goodly tomb, with an infeription in 
brafs under their effigies.
In the fame place lies dame ThomaJinT hombiirgh, wife of 'William Thornburgh 
of Selfide knight, and grand-daughter of the laid Sir Roger Bellingham, witn 
an epitaph over her in white marble.
In the high chancel or quire of this church lies the body of the right reverend 
Robert Dazvfon, bifhop of Clonfert in Ireland â€¢, who in the time of the Irifh 
rebellion returned, with much difficulty, to his native country, and died in 
his father's hcufe in Kendal.
Over his grave is this epitaph inferibed on a 
braf> plate : 
" Hie jacet reverendus in Chrifto Robertus Dawfon, epifcopus Clonfertenfis 
et Ducenfis Hibernicus.
Qui obiit die 13 Apr. 1643." 
Near him divers vicars of Kendal lie buried.
Among whom is Mr. Ralph

This epitaph we only take notice of,

Earls of Kendal there have been feveral.
John duke of Bedford, third fon 
of king Henry the fourth, was advanced to that dignity by his brother king 
Henry the fifth.
John duke of Somerfet was created Earl of Kendal by king 
Henry the fixth.
And by the fame king Henry the fixth, John de Foix, of a 
family of that name in France, for his faithful fervices in the French wars, 
was preferred to that dignity ; fince which time, thofe of that family write 
themfelves earls of Longueville and Kendal.
George, prince of Denmark, hul- 
band of queen Anne, was by king William created earl of Kendal.
There hath been alfo one duke of Kendal ; namely, Charles third fon of king 
James the fecond when duke of York â€¢, but he died young.
And finally ; Erengard Melufina Schuylenberg, a German lady, who came into 
England with king George the firft, was by him honoured with the dignity of 
duchefs of Kendal.
Having thus finifhed what we had to fay concerning the town of Kendal 
and its environs ; we proceed to the other parts of this extenfive parifh, be- 
ginning with Helfington on the.
South, and fo travelling Eaftward through the 
feveral townfhips and manors, and from thence going about by the North and 
Weft, until we arrive where we firft fet out.
HELSINGTON.
Helsington, below Kendal, on the Weft fide of the river Kent, is part of 
the Lumley Fee; and in.
the 14 Ed. 3.
by inquifition after the death of William 
de Ihweng, it appears, that the faid William died feifed in his demefne as of fee 
of the manor of Helfington with the appurtenances, and of the rent of free te- 
nants and tenants at will there of 15 I os 8 d a year, and that the capital mef- 
fuage or manor-houfe there was worth nothing by the year, becaufe it was 
totally in ruins : For the Thweng family, having other and better eftates elfe- 
where, probably never refided at Helfington.
After this, we have found no further particular account of the manor of 
Helfington, till the reign of king Henry the eighth ; when it appears to have 
been in the pofTeffion of a family of the name of Bindlose ; who had alfo 
Borwick-hall in Lancashire, and finally fettled there.
And from them it feems to have been purchafed by the Bellinghams, who 
continued there till the laft century, when this manor (and alfo Over Levins) 
was fold to Colonel James Grahme, whofe great grandfon Henry earl of Suf- 
folk and Berkshire now enjoys the fame.
There is a pedigree of Bindlose, which was delivered in at an herald's vifi- 
tation, in the 4th year of the reign of king Charles the firft ; which is as 
follows : 
1. William Byndlofe of Haylfton in Weftmorland, who lived in the reign of 
king Henry the eighth, had a fon,

2. Robert Byndlofe efquire, whofe wife's name was Agnes Harrifon.
They 
had iflue 8 children.
Amongft whom were, Robert the eldeft, and Agnes 
married to William Fleming of Ridal efquire, and another daughter Dorothy 
married to Sir Thomas Brathwaite of Burnefhead knight.
3. Sir Robert Byndlofe, knight, married to his firft wife Alice daughter of 
Lancelot Dockwray of Dockwray-hall in Kendal; and by her had two daugh- 
ters, Anne, married to Henry Denton of Cumberland, 3nd Alice married to 
Henry Banks of Bank Newton in Yorkfhire.
By his fecond wife, Mary 
daughter of Edmund Eltoft of Churchill in Yorkfhire, he had 5 children.
The firft, Robert ; who died young.
The fecond fucceeded his father, viz.
4. Sir Francis Byndlofe of Borwick knight.
He was firft married to Dorothy 
Charnock of Afhley in Lancashire; by whom he had Mary, of the age of Â£ 
years, at the vifitation aforefaid in 1628.
His fecond wife was Cicely daugh- 
ter of Thomas Weft lord Delawar ; and by her he had 4 children : The eldeft 
was, 
5. Robert, who had ifiue only a daughter, Cicely, married to William Stan- 
difh of Standifli in Lancafhire â€” And here ended the family of Bindlofe, of 
which we have thought proper to give this account, as it is often mentioned 
in the tranfactions of thofe times.
Their arms were; Quarterly, parted per fefs indented Or and Gules, on a 
bend Azure a cinquefoil between two martlets of the firft.
The Creft; a de- 
mihorfe couped, with a ducal flourilhed collar Azure -f-.
It was in the time of the firft or fecond of the above fcries, that Alan Bel- 
lingham efquire purchafed the manor of Helfington.
Which Alan was of a 
younger houfe of the Bellinghams of Burnefhead, and whofe pofteriiy iinally fet- 
tled at Levins..
And therefore his pedigree more properly belongs lO Burnefoead 
until the feparation of this younger branch ; and afterwards to Over-Levins, 
which was their laft place of refidence.
Intermediately, they frequently re- 
lided at Helfington Laithes, the manor-houfe of Helfington.
In Helfington there hath been a family at Sizergh Hall, much more an- 
cient than any of the name of Bindlofe or Bellingham as lords of the manor.
Which family came from Strickland (or rather Stjrkland, which was die 
pafture ground of the young cattle called flirks or fteersj in the parilh of Mor- 
land in this county; in which part they had confiderable poffeiTions, as well as 
at Sizergh and other adjacent places, generally holden under the barons of 
Kendal.
For the barony of Kendal, as we obferved before, extended further 
than the prefent divifion thereof, and efpecially into the weftern part of what 
is now called the Bottom of Weftmorland.
It is fomewhat extraordinary, that amongft the pedigrees of almoft all the 
other ancient families in this county, we have met with no fatisfactory account 
of this family ; but by the indulgence of the late worthy owner of Sizergh-hall, 
Charles Strickland efquire, we have been enabled to make out a regular and

authentic deduction of this family from the cleared and moft undeniable evi- 
dence, namely, the family writings.
From whence, and from other informa- 
tions as they have occafionally fallen in our way, our hiftory of this family 
proceeds as follows : 
I. The firft of the name of Stirkland that we have met with, was in the 
reign of king John â€¢, when Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred, falling under 
the difpleafure of that prince for his having fided with the rebellious barons, 
was required in the 17th year of that king to give hoflages for his future good 
behaviour â€¢, which hoftages were the fons or daughters and heirs of divers of 
the principal mefne lords holding under the barons of Kendal : amongft whom 
was the fon and heir of Walter de Stirkland.
In the time of Hugh bifhop of Carlifle, who came to the fee towards the 
beginning of the reign of king Henry the third, this Walter de Stirkland 
knight had a licence to keep a domeftic chaplain in his family within the parilh 
of Morland, fo as it fhould be no prejudice to the mother church.
For the 
afTurance whereof, he gave juratory caution, that his chaplain fhould not injure 
the mother church in her revenues or in any other refpedl *.

The names of the fheriffs here mentioned nearly afcertain ths time of this 
grant.
For in the 15 and 16 Hen. 3.
Walter bifhop of Carlifle was fheriffof 
Cumberland, and Thomas fon of John his deputy.
The fheriffwick of Weft- 
morland was then become hereditary in the Veteripont family, fo that either 
of thefe perfons could only be under-fheriff there.
Another thing alfo we learn from hence, that this Sir Walter de Stirkland had 
a fon Adam, perhaps the fame that was delivered to king John as an hoftage.
And this helps to compleat our pedigree.
For in the 20 Ed. 1.
William de 
Stirkland knight confirmed this grant, which he flyles the grant of Walter de 
Stirkland his great grandfather.
This William is mentioned as fon of Robert.

Thomas Strickland efquire, now an infant.
The arms of Strickland are j Sable, three efcalops within a bordure ingrailed 
Argent.
Sizergh hall is a venerable old building, in a pleafant fkuation, formed like 
the reft in ancient time, for a place of defence.
The tower is a fquare build- 
ing, defended by two fquare turrets and battlements.
One of them is over 
the great entrance, and has a guard-room capable of containing ten or a dozen 
men, with embrafures.
The winding ftair-cafe terminates in a turret, which- 
defends the other entrance.
There is in this houfc an apartment called the Queen's, with the royal arms 
therein.
From whence k hath been vulgarly imagined that this place belonged to 
the crown ; and it is faid that thefe arms were put up by queen Katherine Parr,, 
widow of king Henry the eighth.
This perhaps may be true, that the faid 
queen might be admitted to retire to this place after the king's death â€¢, but it 
did not then- belong to the crown, but to the Strickland family, as it had done- 
long before.
Nor could the queen reQde here long â€¢, for me married again fo 
foon after the king's death, that had fhe then proved pregnant, it was faid that 
it would be doubtful to what hufband the child mould belong, and fhe died in 
the year following.
The chapel of Helfington, in point of fituation and neatnefs of building 
is inferior to few of the chapels within this parifh-, affording a beautiful and 
romantic profpecT:, of the fea, woods, rocks, and a fertile valley below.
It 
was founded in the year 1726, by John Jackibnof Holeflack gentleman; who 
gave an eftate called Scar-houfe in Helfington, towards a yearly ftipend for a 
teaching curate: fo as a chapel, with veftry or fchool-houfe annexed* fhould 
be erected, and a chapel yard fufficiently fenced out ; with all ornaments and 
conveniences belonging to the fame.
All which was accordingly effected, by 
contribution of the inhabitants, and his own further donation.
Afterwards he gave another eftate, called Chamber tenement, within the 
faid chapelry, on condition that the inhabitants mould raife 100/ towards ob- 
taining an augmentation from the governors of queen Anne's bounty.
In pur- 
fuance whereof, the fum of 44 / 12s od was fubfcribed by the inhabitants 5.
and the remainder, being 55I 8s od, was given by Mr. Matfon the curate..
In confideration of which eftate, and of the faid fum of 100/, the governors of 
2 the 
104 PARISH OF KENDAL.
(Natland.) -1 
the faid bounty gave 200/: With which fum of 200/, a field was purchafed 
called Kirkbarrow, within a place called Churchfield, adjoining to Kirkland; 
and the remaining fum of 100/ was laid out in a parcel of land called Rawn- 
rigg in Barbon in this county.
And in the year 1 745, the faid chapel was confecrated by bifhop Peplowe, 
by the name of the chapel of St. John.
In the year 1762, the late bifhop of Chefter, Dr. Keene, procured 200/ 
from the countefs dowager Gower, towards a further augmentation ; which 
augmentation being obtained from the faid governors, the whole fum of 400/ 
was laid out in the purchafe of an eitate at Scarfoot in Underbarrow.
And 
the whole revenue of the chapel, from the feveral eftates above mentioned, 
amounts to about 80/ a year; which renders it worthy of the acceptance of a 
clergyman of liberal education.
The prefent curate is the reverend John Wil- 
fon, M.
A. fellow of Trinity college in Cambridge ; to whofe learning, in- 
duftry, and knowledge, we are indebted for feveral ufeful informations in this 
â– part of the county.
And to this chapel, being of fo late foundation, the vicar hath undoubted 
right of nomination ; whereas in many of the other chapelries, the inhabitants 
prefcribe to nominate by cuftom for time immemorial.
. 
The faid Mr. Jackfon gave alfo a fmall parcel of land called Jack Parrock 
for the ufe of the chapel clerk : and 13^4^ yearly, being one moiety of the 
rent of a (hop in Kendal, for teaching three poor boys or girls of the faid town- 
fhip, in reading, writing, and arithmetic; to be named by the curate, and 
the executrix of the faid John Jackfon, her heirs or affigns for ever..
NATLAND.
Advancing Eaftward from Helfington, we come to Natland, which is a 
fmall manor or lordfhip, containing only about 30 families.
It feems to have 
had its name from the Nativi or bondmen probably placed there, as attendent 
upon the capital lord at Kendal caftle to do fervile offices, like as the inha- 
bitants of Bondgate nigh Appleby, or the Drengage tenants nigh Brougham 
caftle.
The chapelry alfo of Natland is commenfurate to the manor.
It is of the Marquis Fee, and hath of a long time been the property of the 
Strickland family of Sizergh.
Upon the death of Walter Strickland efquire, in the 11 Eliz.
the inquifition 
finds, that he held of the heir of Thomas Parr knight the manor of Natland, 
with the appurtenances, as of the fourth part of the barony of Kendale, by 
knights fervice ; and that it was worth by the year 26 1 9 s lod.
And that 
he held in Natland 16 acres of paflure ground, and 30 acres of wood called 
Natland Park; of the yearly value of 16 s 8 d.
His great grandfon Sir Thomas Strickland knight fold to the tenants their 
.eftates to freehold, except fome few fields and a cottage or two, which continue 
-of arbitrary tenure and heriotable, of which the owners at that time probably 
were not able to purchafe the infranchifement.

CHAP.
At the time of Mr. Machel's furvey, there was at Natland a ruinated chapel, VI - 
9 yards long and near 5 yards wide; without any chapel-yard, or any falary 
belonging to it.
About the year 1735, the inhabitants rebuilt the fame, and 
gave the profits of two inclofures belonging to the townfhip, together with 
an annual fubfcription, to a perfon who mould teach their children, and read 
prayers in the chapel on Sundays.
In the year 1 746, an augmentation of 200/ by the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty came to this chapel by lot, with which an eftate was purchafed 
in Skelfmergh.
And in 1749, it received a further augmentation by lot of 
200/; and in 1754 was again augmented with 400/, viz.
200/ from the faid 
governors, 100 / from the truftees of archbifhop Bolter late primate of Ireland, 
and 100/ from the executors of the late Dr. Stratford; which whole fum of 
600/ was laid out in the purchafe of two eftates, one in Old Hutton and the 
other in Barbon.
And the whole revenue now amounts to about 33/ a year.
The mod remarkable place within this chapelry is Water-Crock, half a mile 
north from the chapel, and about as much fouth from Kendal church.
It is 
fo called from a remarkable turn in the water, the river Kent almoft furround- 
ing it, in the fhape of an horfe-fhoe.
The area inclofed by the turn of the 
water is about eight acres.
The Romans, obferving the advantage of the fituation, placed a fort or ftation 
here, which feems to have been the Concangium of the Notitia.
Mr. Machel, 
on a perfonal furvey, fays, That there have been dug up here fragments of 
Roman urns, bricks, and cement; and an oven was found under ground, be- 
ing built with bricks or tiles on the infide fixed one into another, run over with 
cement half a foot thick, and the bottom paved with bricks one foot broad 
and three inches thick.
Amongft the ruins was found a Roman floor 16 inches deep, of three courfes, 
the loweft courfe being a cement of lime and land with fome pounded brick 
about 9 inches deep, then a courfe of gravel and pebbles about 4 inches, then 
a courfe of true Roman cement with great ftore of pounded brick in it about 
3 inches.
There were refervoirs of water made of the fame cement.
And a femicir- 
cular courfe of vacuities like ovens, divided by a thin brick between each.
Within the area, there are marks of trenches about 140 yards fquare, with 
many foundations of buildings.
The angles of the fquare fort appear to have been rounded after the Roman 
fafhion.
Mr. Horfley takes notice of feveral coins and feals that have been found here, 
and fome broken altars and ftatues.
One infcription of the fepulchral kind he 
hath in part preferved, fo far as he was able to make it out, which is as 
follows :

SCALTHWAITE RIGG, HAY, AND HUTTON IN THE HAY.
Scalthwaite Rigg is varioufly written of old time : It feems to be derived- 
from fcale, a /belter, fhed, or hut for habitation ; from whence comes alfo the 
word Jhield; fo the Jhell of a fifh, or of a nur, is by the common people flill 
pronounced Jfyell.
â€” â€”Hutton, adjoining, is of the fame import; being the 
place where they had erected huts or cottages in the forelt or hunting ground, 
now diftinguifhed by the names of Old and New Hutton.
Within the in- 
elofed hunting ground or park, which the word Hay imports, the fca'.es or huts 
there erected, by way of further diftinction, were denominated Hutton in the 
Hay. And this distinction feems to have been made, upon the divifion of the 
eftate between the two fitters before mentioned of William de Lancattre the 
third.
For Old and New Hutton are of the Richmond Fee; and Sca'thwaite 
Rigg, Hay, and Hutton in the Hay, are of the Marquis Fee. Thwaite, the 
other component of the word firft above mentioned, means a parcel of ground 
where the wood has been grubbed up and cleared away.
In the 15 Eliz.
part of the dower affigned to the widow of William Parr,, 
marquis of Northampton, was as follows : 
" Manor of Skaltwaitrigg : Every tenant by ancient cuftom is to pay yearly 
" to the lord at the keeping of his court for his greenhew 2 d, or elie 1 d asd

OLD HUTTON, NEW HUTTON, AND HOLME SCALES.
At firft: there was only one general name of Hutton.
The distinction be-

the reign of king Edward the firft.
Holme Scales is in the parifli of Bur I on ; being, as the name imports, fcales 
or huts belonging to Holme in that parifli.
But for the lake of vicinity and

firflr, the tenements in Old Hut ton and Holme Scales appear to have been held 
of the king as of his manor of Kirkby in Kendale called the Richmond Fee, 
in focage, by payment of certain rents.
This manor, together with many 
freehold rents, after feveral mefne conveyances, is now the property of Sir 
Michael le Fleming of Rydal baronet.
In New Hutton, which alio is of the Richmond Fee, there are only about.
two tenements of freehold.
The chapel of Old Hutton was built about the year 1628, and rebuilt in 1699.
The original chapel falary, like as of many of the reft, feems to have been twenty 
nobles, or 61 13J \d\ of which, four nobles were paid by the inhabitants 
of Holme Scales (as certified in 171 7), who had feats in the chapel -, but they 
afterwards with-held the payment on pretence of their being within another 
parifh.
The remaining fixteen nobles were then reduced to fomewhat lefs 
than fifteen, viz.
4/ 17 s lod: And the ancient falary ismow only 4/ 12 s od.
Mr. Henry Bateman devifed lands to this chapel, which in 17 17 were certified 
at 5/ 10/ od yearly.
And in the year 1706, one Thomas Robinfon of Old 
Hutton gave by his will 5/ a year to this chapel for an afternoon fermon.
About 30 years ago, this chapel received an augmentation by lot of 200/ 
from the governors of queen Anne's bounty.
The executors of the will of the 
late Dr. Stratford gave 100/, unto which was added another 100/ by other 
benefactors, and therewith a further augmentation of 200/ was procured from 
the faid governors.
With all which fums lands have been purchafed.
Nigh unto the chapel is the fchsol, which was built at the expence of Ed- 
ward Milner of Kendal yeoman; and endowed by him, in 1613, with nigh 
20/ a year.
It was rebuilt and rendered more commodious by contribution 
of the inhabitants and others in 1753.
In this fchool there is a considerable, 
parochial library, eftablifhed in the year 1757.
Belonging to this townfhip is an eftate given by Roger Ward of Old Hut- 
ton, now of the value of 8 / a year ; to be distributed among, the poor houf- 
holders of Old Hutton and Holme Scales.
There is alfo a rent charge of 26 s 8 d ifTuing out of an eftate at Bendridge 
in the faid townfhip, to be applied to the like purpofes.
The aforefald Thomas Robinfon gave 12 loaves weekly to be distributed, 
amongst 12 poor houfliolders.
And Jofeph Dawfon, alderman of Kendal, 
gave other 12, to be distributed in like manner.
The chapel of New Hutton was built in the year 1 739, and endowed by con- 
tribution of the inhabitants of New Hutton, Hay, and Hutton in the Hay,, 
with 200/; whereby an augmentation of 200/ was procured from the gover- 
nors of queen Anne's bounty, and an eftate purchafed therewith in Killington.
In 1756, a further augmentation of 200/ by lot fell to the faid chapel, where- 
with an eftate was purchafed at Grayrigg.
The rents of thele two eftates make up the whole revenue of the chapel.

hofpital of St. Leonard's, in York.
This hofpital had divers pofTeffions irr 
Weltmorland, as at Afby, Crofby Ravenfworth, Newby, Mebnrn, and Hoff.
And particularly, Ketel fon of Eldred, fon of Ivo de Talebois, gave to the 
faid hofpital certain lands in Kirkeby, and William de Lancaftre the firft gave 
to the fame divers lands in High Barton : In exchange for which lands, Wil- 
liam de Lancaftre the fecond by his charter granted to the faid hofpital the 
manor of Docker, by the metes and bounds therein fpecified *.
Which grant was confirmed by Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred, and 
afterwards by king Edward the firft.
The faid Gilbert further granted to the 
faid hofpital, that they might have their horfes and hogs going in his foreft, 
with two folds wherein to take them ; and that they might have one of their 
own brethren, together with one fecular perfon, to tend the horfes and hogs 
within the foreft, without bow, arrows, or dog : and if their cattle fhould ftray 
out of the above granted limits into the foreft, that they mould be driven back 
quietly and without hurt or damage to the brethren of the faid hofpital -f .
This place claims, and in fome refpects exercifeth, a privilege of exemption 
from ecclefiaftical jurifdiftion; but by whom, or in what inftances, the fame 
hath been granted, we have not found.
After the diffolution of the religious houfes, this manor feems to have been 
granted to one Richard Washington; for in the 35 Hen. 8.
there is a licence 
of alienation to Richard Wafoington, to convey the manor of Docker to Richard

the year 1690, fold the fame, together with the manors of Grayrigg and Lamb- 
rigg, to Sir John Lowther baronet â€¢, in whofe name and family the fame ftill 
continues in the perfon of Sir James Lowther baronet.
This manor pays a quit rent of 1 3 s \d yearly to the duke of Leeds, whofe 
anceftor in the reign of king Charles the fecond purohafed this and many other 
fee farm rents of the crown in this county.
LAMBRIGG.
This perhaps might be the place to which they carried their lambs at certain 
feafons.
For many places received their name of diftinction from fuch like 
circumftances ; as, Sheepfhead, Ramfbottom, Ewbank, Stirkland, Cowbrow, 
Oxenholme, and the like.
In the 1 1 Ed. 1.
Thomas de Chenaye granted to Gilbert de Bronolmjheade all 
his lands at Lambrigg (referving only to himfelf the park) ; all which he had 
of Lambert de BuJJey.
By the heirefs of Burne/head the fame came to Bellingham â€¢, and by one of the 
daughters and coheirs of the laft Belliiigham of Burnejhead, to Anthony Ducket of 
Grayrigg efquire, whofe defcendent Anthony Ducket efquire fold the fame as 
aforefaid to Sir John Lowther, in whofe family it ftill continues.
Lambrigg is of the Marquis Fee, and was holden of the king in capite by 
knights fervice.
There is no remembrance or tradition of any deer having been kept in Lamb- 
rigg park, or any other place belonging to the Duckets; although fo consider- 
able a family in ancient time was feldom without.
"Within this manor there is a vein of copper, which was wrought by the late 
vifcount Lonfdale.
But the water being very troublefome, and the vein withal 
jiot very rich, he defifted.
DILLAKER.
Adjoining to Lambrigg on the EafV, is the hamlet of Dillaker ; of which 
we have met with no particular account.
It is in the parifh of Kendal, but in 
Lonfdale Ward ; and perhaps hath been anciently part of the manor of Kil- 
lington and Firbank.
It is freehold ; and in the furvey of the Queen's lands 
in the 28 Cha. 2.
ftands charged with a free rent of 3 j, of the Marquis Fee.
GRAYRIGG.
Having now advanced to the Eaftern extremity of the parifh of Kendal, we 
incline Northwards to the manor of Grayrigg â€¢, fo called probably from being 
frequented by badgers, brocks, or grays; as on the eaft fide of the river Lune, 
oppofite thereto, is a place which yet bears the name of Brockhdes.

This manor of Grayrigg, like as the reft, belonged to the barons of Kendal, 
and was granted by William de Lancajlre the firfh in marriage with his daughter 
Agnes, to Alexander de Windefore, fon and heir of William de Windefre *.
The laid Alexander had a fon William de Windefore; who was a juror on fe- 
veral inquifuions pfl mortem in the reign of king Edward the firfl.
Which 
William had a fon Alexander, who levied a fine of the manors of .Grayrigg and 
Morland in the u Ed. 2.
This Jaffc Alexander had a fon William de Windefcre, who was knight of the 
fhire for Weftmorland in the 28 Ed. 3.
and was meriff of Cumberland in the 
41ft and 42d of the fame king.
By the inquifition pofi mortem of Joan de Coupland aforefaid in the 49 Ed. 3.
he appears to have held of the faid Joan the manors of Heverfham, Morland, 
and Grayrigg.
Which William had a daughter and heir Margery, who in the reign of king 
Richard the fecond was married to John Ducket efquire, fon of Hugh, fon of 
Richard, fon of William, fon of Richard Ducket of Fillingham in the county 
of Lincoln efquire ; and hence came the Duckets to the manor of Grayrigg and 
other pofitrTions in Weftmorland, who enjoyed the fame for 12 generations 
following, with this peculiar felicity, that none of the iffue male, poffefibrs of 
the family eftate, was ever in ward, every anceftor living until his heir was 
above 21 years of age.
The arms of Windefore were ; Gules, a faltier Argent, between 12 crofs 
erofslets Or.
The fucceffion of the faid family of Docket of Grayrigg was as follows : 
1. John Ducket aforefaid, who married the heirefs of Windefore, had a fort 
and heir, 
2. Richard- Ducket of Grayrigg efquire ; who' married a daughter of Sir 
Richard Redman of Over Levins knight : And by her had ifTue,

He married Elizabeth

In the time of this Anthony, there was a fuit in chancery between him and 
the tenants of Grayrigg, Lambrigg, and Docker; the tenants fetting forth in 
their bill, that in the 11 Cha. 1.
a decree had been obtained in the court at 
York for the northern parts by the tenants againft Anthony Ducket efquire 
fon of Sir Francis, whereby the tenants were to pay one year's moderate value 
for a fine both general and fpecial ; and that the widows were to pay the gene- 
ral fine, but no fine upon their admiffion but only the beft beaft ; that fines not 
afTeffed and demanded before the tenant died mould be loft ; and that all boons 
and duties to the king were to be reprized: That the faid Anthony was fuc- 
ceeded by his fon James ; and that the like decree was obtained againft him 
in the court of chancery in 1662 : That James was fucceeded by the prefent 
Anthony his fon ; and they claimed in-like manner, according as had been de- 
termined by the aforefaid decrees.
They claimed likewile underwood, anci 
wood for all neceiTary boots, and loppings of timber trees and other wood, for 
which they paid greenhew.
And it was decreed, in the year 1670, that they 
mould pay for a fine one clear yearly value that the tenement would let for, 
above the lord's rent and other reprizes.
The determination concerning the 
wood was referred till York affizes.
The reafon why thefe.

Not long after this, the faid Anthony fold the eftate to Sir John Lowther,

All his brothers alfo died without iflue male; and the 
name and family in Weftmorland is now extinct.
The arms of Ducket are -, Sable, a faltier Argent.
About the year 1695, the faid Sit John Lowther infranchifed the tenants of 
Grayrigg, Lambrigg, and Docker ; except fome few who were not able to 
purchafe.
Grayrigg-hall, being the ancient manor houfe, was a ftrong old building, in 
a quadrangular form, adapted for defence more than for convenience.
It is 
row totally in ruins, moft of the lead and timber thereof having been re- 
tnoved to Lowther.
The chapel of Grayrigg is common to the feveral townfhips of Grayrigg, 
Lambrigg, Docker, Whinfell, and Dillaker.
The ancient falary is 20 nobles.
In the year 1708, this chapel was rebuilt at the expence of the inhabitants; 
and foon after made parochial.
In 1723, Anthony Lowther efquire, brother to Henry vifcount Lonfdale, 
gave 100/ to this chapel, unto which the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
added another 100/, wherewith an eftate was purchafed in^Dillaker.
And in 1751, the fum of 200/ was advanced to the faid governors, and 
with other 200/ allowed by them, an eftate of 400/ value was purchafed in 
Whinfell.
An infeription on the wall in the infide of this chapel will inform 
pofterity to whom they ftand indebted for this eftate : which is as follows, 
" This chapel obtained the Queen's bounty in the year 1751, by the liberal

WHINFELL 
From Grayrigg, travelling northwards, along the eaftern extremity of the 
parifb, we come to Whinfell â€¢, which carries its own derivation along with it.
This manor appears to have been early divided into moieties, or feparate 
Shares ; as were many other manors, fometimes by purchafe, and not feldom 
by the marriage of coheirs.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland, the inquifition finds, 
that Matthew de Redman (of Over Levins) held of the faid Joan, on the day 
on which me died, a moiety of the vill of Quinfell.
Who held then the other 
moiety, is not certain : In the reign of Hen. 6.
it appears to have been in the 
Stricklandsof Sizergh.
And amongft the efcheats in the n Eliz.
it is found, 
that Walter Strickland efquire held of the queen in capite by knights fervice the 
Manor of Whinfell (which probably means only a moiety thereof ; for it was 
very ufual in like cafes to exprefs the whole inftead of a part : So when they 
come to fell fuch part, they exprefs the manor in general, meaning thereby fo 
much thereof as belonged to the vendor).
And amongft the Efcheats in the 
3 Cha. 1.
it appears that William Thomebrughe efquire held of the heirs of 
Richard Redman in focage, a moiety of the manor of Whinfell (that is, the 
Redman moiety aforefaid) : And he held alfo in Whinfell, Selfyde, and Patton y 
divers lands and tenements of the clear yearly value of 61 4^4 d.
And ar 
the fame time Richard Ducket efquire held three meftuages and tenements in 
Whinfell in focage of the clear yearly value of 41 s.
In the year 1670, Sir Thomas Strickland of Thornton Briggs in the county of 
York knight, and Walter Strickland of Rippon efquire, conveyed to Robert 
Stephenfon and three others, truftees for the inhabitants and land-owners, par- 
cel of the faid manor, by the general name of all that the manor, feigniory, 
townfhip, or lordfhip of Whinfell, with all its rights, members, and appurte- 
nances.
And the faid truftees conveyed to the ieveral land-owners ; Yet fo, 
that the mines and quarries upon the waftes, the waifs and eftrays, and fifhings 
in the ponds or tarns on the waftes or commons, Were to remain in the truf- 
tees, for the ufe of the tenants at large.
And in 1723, by indenture quadripartite, between Jane Thornburgh of Ken- 
dal, widow of Rowland Thornburgh of Methop efquire, of the firfl part ; 
John Traffcrd of Crofton in the county of Lancafter efquire, aud Elizabeth 
his wife, lifter and heir of Thomas Thornburgh efquire deceafed, fon and heir of

land-owners, of the fourth part-, they the laid Jane Thornburgh, John Traf- 
ford and Elizabeth his wife, Thomas Townley, and John Knipe, for the fum of

fhips, or feigniorks, of Whinfell alias Whinfield, Selfide, Skelfmergh, and Pat- 
ton-, with all royalties, deodands, ponds, waifs and eftrays : paying thereout 
yearly 9 s \\d to the king ; and a yearly rent of 1 s to the lord vifcount Lonf- 
da'e.
And the truftees conveyed feve rally to the tenants: The filhery in 
Whinfell tarn to remain amongft the tenants undivided.
The learned Dr. John Pearfon, bilhop of Chefter, was defcended of a.
fa* 
mily of that name in this townfhip.
FAWCET FORES TV.
Purfuing our courfe northwards, we come to Fawcet Forest, at the tit- - 
mod extremity of the pariCh towards the eaft and north.
It was anciently 
called Faufide, and belonged to the abbey of Byland in Yorkfhire, having 
been given thereto by William de Lancaftre the firft.- Burton's Mon. Ebcr.

After the diflblution of the monafteries, it was purchafed by Alan Belling- 
ham efquire, a younger fon of the Bellinghams of Burnefhead, who alio pur- 
chafed Helfington and Levins.
The laft of whofe family at Levins fold this, .
together with the other eftates, to Colonel James Grahme, from whom it hath 
defcended to the prefent earl of Suffolk and Berkfhire.
It is within the chapelry of Selfide.
Foreft-hall is the ancient manor houfe ; and one half of the foreft ftill lies 
in demefne.
WHITWELL AND S EL SIDE.
Inclining weftward, we come to Whitwell and Selside, which though 
feparate divifions, yet make but one conftablewick, and feem to have been 
originally but one manor.
When they were firft feparated, doth not appear.
They became united afterwards in the ancient family of Thornburgh, which 
came from Thornburgh in Yorkfhire, afterwards removed to Hampsfell in Lan- 
cashire, and finally fettled in Weftmorland.
The firft account we have of Whitwell is in the 25 Ed. 3.
in which year we 
find that Gilbert de Burnejloeved held of William de Coucy the hamlet of Whitwell, 
by the fervice of cornage, wardfhip, and relief.
(Where we may obferve, by 
the way, that though the king had acquitted them of cornage, yet he did not 
thereby alter the tenure, but only remitted the payment.) â€” The heirefs of 
Burnejhead was married to Bellingham, and one of the daughters and coheirs of 
the laft Bellingham of Burnejhead brought Whitwell 'by marriage into this family 
of Thornburgh,

All thefe refpectively 
were chofen to reprefent the faid county in parliament â€” But what connexion 
thefe had with the prefent family, doth not certainly appear.
The family pedigree (as copied from one remaining at Selfide hall, by Sir 
Daniel Fleming in the year 1670, which alfo agrees in the main with a pedi- 
gree certified at an herald's vilitation in 1628) begins with, 
I. William de Thornburghe of Thornburghe in the county of York 
efquire â€¢, who married a daughter of Sir John Crok-er of the city of London 
knight, and had iffue, 
II.
Sir William Thornburgh of Thornburgh knight: He married Anne 
daughter of Richard Maleverer efquire, and by her had iffue, William who > 
died without iffue, John who refided at Hamsfeld'm Lancalhire, and Anne mar- - 
ried to Chriftopher Curwen efquire.
III.
John Thornburgh of Hamsfeld, efquire;, married Elizabeth daughter 
of Sir Henry Pierpoint knight.
They had iffue, William, Thomas, John dean 
of York, and Margaret married to William Eafton of the county of Lan- 
caster.
IV.
William Thornburgh efquire, fon and heir of John.
He married 
Catherine daughter of William Hilton efquire; and had iffue Thomas, William^ .
and Henry â€¢, and a daughter Mary, married to Thomas Coatfworth ; and ano- 
ther daughter Catherine, married to John Balderftone.
In the 20 Ric. 2.
there was one William de Thornburgh-, who had a daughter 
Margaret married to William Machel of Crackenthorp gentleman.
But whe* 
ther fhe was daughter of this William that we now fpeak of, doth not appear 
from the pedigree.
Indeed, befides thofe of this name above mentioned which are not taken 
notice of in the pedigree, there are other confufions in this, as in almoft all 
other ancient pedigrees, which feldom agree in all points with the inquifitions 
prfi mortem (where fuch can be found), or other authentic inftruments.
Whicri 
is not at all to be wondered at after fucfia length of time, in which alfo there

have been To rrany revolutions by the contefts between the houfes of York and 
^ l - Lancafter, rhe civil wars in the reign of kinp Charles che firft, and efpecially in 
thefe northern parts by the burnings and defolation made by the Scots.
In one of the genealogies of this family, we find about this time William Je 
Thornburgh who is laid to have married Eleanor daughter of one Selfed of Selfed 
gentleman (and hence Sir Daniel Fleming obferves, that this place in king 
Richard the fecond's time came by marriage to the Thornburghs) \ which Wil- 
li am ^ by his wife Eleanor Selfed, had iffue William, Rowland, Edward, and 
Leonard: That William the eldeft married Margaret daughter of John Wafh- 
ingtonof Washington in the county of Lancafter efcjuire, and by her had iffue 
William who married Eleanor daughter of Sir Richard Mufgrave hereafter 
mentioned.
But in all our difquifitions we have never met with any other 
perfon of the name of Selfed ; and the family of Thornburgh undoubtedly had 
poffeffions in Weftmorland long before this time.
Therefore probably here 
mult have been fome miftake.
And their own family pedigree goes on thus : 
V. Thomas Thornburch efquire, fon and heir of William by his wife 
Catherine Hilton, married Jane daughter of Sir John Dalfton knight ; and had 
iffue Henry, Thomas, Richard, and Robert.
VI.
Henry Thornburch efquire, fon and heir of Thomas, married Eli- 
zabeth daughter of Matthew Boothe efquire; and by her had iffue, Wildam, 
John, Henry, Jane married to William Bradihaigh, Catherine a nun, and Eli- 
zabeth married to Pierce Starkey.
VII.
William Thornburch of Hamsfeld efquire.
He lived in the reign 
of king Henry the fixth.
He married Elianor daughter of Sir Richard Muf- 
grave of Mufgrave knight â€¢, and had iffue, 
VIII.
William Thornburch of Hamsfeld efquire, who married Eliza- 
beth daughter and heir of Thomas Broughton of Broughton in Lancafhire 
efquire.
They had iffue, Rowland, Anne married to Thomas Prefton of Levins, 
Thomas, Nicholas, Elizabeth married to William Kirkby of Radcliff in Lanca- 
Ihire, and Dorothy married to William Clifton of Weftby in the faid county.
IX.
Rowland Thornburgh of Hamsfeld efquire.
He married Margaret 
daughter of Sir Geoffrey Middleton of Middleton-hall knight; and by her 
had iffue, William, Rowland, Elianor married to Robert Beck gentleman, Eli- 
zabeth married to Thomas Warcop of Smerdale efquire, Anne married to 
Thomas Roos gentleman, and Alice married to Thomas Kellet of Winder in 
the county of Lancafter.
X. Sir William Thornburch of Hamsfeld knight.
He married Tho- 
rnafin one of the four daughters and coheirs of Sir Robert Bellingham of 
Burnefhead knight.
In the 15 Eliz.

15 meffuages and tenements in Whitwell of the faid queen as of her barony 
of Kendal.
She died in the 26 t liz and there is a monument of her in

The chapel of Selfide was heretofore in the hall or manor houfe.
Which 
being inconvenient to the owners, who were all along Roman catholicks, the 
late William Thornburgh efquire gave to the inhabitants a parcel of ground, 
at about 200 yards diftance, for a chapel and chapelyard, in a beautiful fitu- 
ation -, and a new chapel was accordingly erected and confecrated and made 
parochial.
And on the chapel becoming vacant, a difpute happened between 
the vicar of Kendal and the inhabitants concerning the appointing of a curate j 
the vicar claiming as of common right, efpecially this being a new chapel â€¢, 
and the inhabitants claiming by cuftom for time immemorial of chufing their 
curate.
But in regard of the great expence of a fuit in chancery, the vicar 
gave it up.
It was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty at 
3/ 19^ od being the ancient chapel falary.
In 17-7, it was certified at 8/5J od,

In 172 1, Peter Shepherd gave 40/, the intereft

In 1722, it was augmented by 100/ given by

200/ by, the governors of queen Anne's bounty ; with which, and other parifh 
money, two eftates in Whinfell called Harrod and Stonegarth were purchafed

Skelsmergh and Patton are both one conftablewick, but they have been 
feparate divifions for a long time.
Skelsmergh belonged to the Laburns for upwards of 400 years; the prin- 
cipal refidence of which family was at Cunfwick.
. 
It was granted in the reign of king Henry the third to Robert de Leyburne 
by William de Laneaftre the third, by the metes and bounds in the grant fpe- 
cified : Saving to the faid William his hunting therein ; but with permiffion to 
the faid Robert and his heirs to take within the fame wild goats, foxes, and 
and hares, without hindrance of the faid William or his heirs.
Rendering for 
the fame yearly a pair of gilt fpurs at the feaft of St. Michael, for all fervices.
Witnefies whereof were, Sir Roger de Leyburne, Sir Ralph de Aincourt, Sir 
Richard de Copeland, Sir Matthew de Redeman, Sir Richard de Winewick, Â» 
Sir Richard de Bereburne, Thomas de Levins, Thomas the Tax-gatherer 
(Thoma Talliatore), Gilbert de Wateby, and many others *.
â€” It is called in the 
laid grant, and many other ancient evidences, Skelfmerefergh.
In the 30 Ed. 1.
there was a grant of free warren in Skelfmerefergh to Nicholas 
de Leyburne grandfon of the faid Robert J.
The Leyburns in queen Elizabeth's time, being great fufferers for popery, 
fold the manor to Bellingham of Levins and Braithwaite of Burnefhead, who 
infranchifed moft of the tenants.
But the hall and demefne continued to the 
Laburns till the year 17 15, which being then forfeited, they were purchafed by 
Thomas Crowle efquire, and by him fold to Daniel (Vilfon of Dallam Tower 
efquire, grandfather of Daniel IVilfon efquire the prefent owner.
There was heretofore a chapel in Skelfmergh, dedicated to St. John Bap- 
tift â€¢, with the ftream of a well, called St. John's well, running through it 
from Eaft to Weft.
Mr. Machel fays, part of it was {landing in his time, 
and the current of water was planked over, and there were fome feats remain- 
ing in the quire.
There was one Sir Uter Gilpin chaplain here before the re- 
formation, as appears by his will written with his own hand.
There were fome lands and tenements in Skelfmergh, which belonged to the 
abbey of St. Mary's York, given probably by Ivo de Talebois or fome of his 
fuccefibis.
In the 4 and 5 Ph. and Mary, there was a grant of two fulling mills nigh 
Sprent-bridge in Skelfmergh, and divers lands there called Kirkfields (probably 
the fame that had belonged to the abbey), to Walter Northcourt and John his 
fon, to hold of the crown by fealty only, in focage, as of the manor of Eaft 
Greenwich.
Patton feems anciently to have belonged to a family of that name.

In the 20 Ed. 3.

After this, we find no more of the name de Patten.
But not long after, 
Patton appears to have belonged to the Bellinghams of Burnefhead â€¢, and with 
Tbomafm one of the daughters and coheirs of the laft Bellingbam of Burnef- 
head, to have come to the T'hornburghs of Methop and Selfide.
And accord- 
ingly, in the 3 Cha. 1.
after the death of William Thornburgh, the inquifition 
finds, that he held the manor of Patton of William late marquis of North- 
ampton, and afterwards of the king, as of his cafile of Kendal, by the fervice 
of one red rofe at the feaft of St. John Baptift yearly, if demanded ; and ic 
was worth by the year 20 s.
In which family it continued till the year 1723, 
when it was fold, together with part of Whinfcll and Selfide- as is aforefaid, to 
truftees for the ufe of the tenants.
A moiety of the lands in Patton (which probably had come by the marriage 
of a daughter and coheir) was granted to the priory of Coniefnead in Lanca- 
fhire ; as appears from a confirmation by king Edward the fecond of giants 
made to the laid priory, amongft which there is a recital of the grant which 
John fon of Richard de Coupland made to the canons of the ("aid priory of all 
the lands of the faid John, with the appurtenances, in Patton-, namely, a 
moiety of the faid vill, except one acre which was holden by Bertlot de Bat 
chefley f.
BURNESHEAD.
This name is varioufly written of ancient time, but mofc commonly Burnes- 
head, and feems intended to fignify the head of the burn or river which fprings 
a little above in Kentmere.
The manor belonged anciently to a family of the name de Burneshead ; 
of which family we have only the laft of the name, before it ended in a daugh- 
ter.
And this was Gilbert de Burne/foead; of whom mention is fuft made, in 
any writing that we have found, in the 11 Ed. 1.
who in that year purchafed 
Lambrigge of Thomas de Chenave.
About feven years after this, in a conteft between the two daughters of Ro- 
bert de Veteripont concerning the iheriffwick of Weftmorland, one of the 
daughters prefented this fame Gilbert to the barons of the exchequer, to be 
fvvorn into the office of under-fheriff.

This Gilbert had an only daughter and heir Margaret, who was married to 
Richard de Bellingham, whofe anceftors received their furname from a place 
called Bellingham in Tindale in the county of Northumberland ; in which 
family this manor of Burnefhead continued a long time.
The arms of Gilbert de Burnejhead were-, Argent, three bendlets Gules, on 
a canton of the fecond a lion rampant of the firft.
Some of the Bellinghams have attempted to derive their defcent from an 
ancient family in this county and elfewhere de Bello-campo ; but as they do not 
make out the connexion,, this can be looked upon only as matter of conjecture, 
and the conjecture itfelf feems to be founded on a miftake â€¢, for the furname 
de Bello-campo, when diverted of the Latin idiom, is not Bellingham, but Beau- 
champ, commonly pronounced Beecham.
The firft of this family of Bellingham, of whom we can pronounce with cer- 
tainty, was, 
1. William de Bellingham, father of the aforefaid Richard; who in the 
2 Ed. 1.
was under-fherifFto William de Swineburne in the parts of Tindale.
2. Richard de Bellingham, who married (as aforefaid) Margaret daugh- 
ter and heir of Gilbert de Burnejhead knight ; and thereupon came to Burnef- 
head, in the reign of king Edward the 2d.
They had a ion, 
3. Robert de Bellingham of Burnefhead, whofe wife's name was Mar- 
garet Salkeld.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland, the 
jurors find, that Robert de Bellingham held of her divers tenements in Strickland 
Ketel.
This Robert had a fon, 
4. Richard de-Bellingham; who married Anne daughter of John de 
Barburne; and had iffue, 
5. Sir Rodert Bellingham of Burnefhead knight.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
he was one of the jurors on the inquifition pojl mortem of John de Clifford.
He 
married Elizabeth daughter of Sir Thomas Tunftall of Thurland in the county 
of Lancafter; and by her had iiTue, (1) Henry, his elded fon and heir.
(2) 
Richard, from whom defcended the Bellinghams of Lincolnshire.
(3) Robert, 
who married a daughter of Sir Robert Afke by Elizabeth his wife daughter of 
the aforefaid John de Clifford, lord of Weftmcrland and hereditary fheriff of 
the fame.

This laft Sir Robert fold Burnefhead to Sir Thomas Clifford.
And by the 
inquifition after the death of the fatd Sir Thomas Clifford knight, the jurors 
find, that he died feifed in his demefne as of fee of the manor of Burnefhead, 
and of one corn mill parcel of the faid manor: Out of which manor, by his 
deed dated Nov. 26.
in the 33 Hen. 8.
he granted to Marmaduke Wyvell 
efquire and dame Mabel his wife (late wife of Roger Btlimgham deceafed) 
an annuity of 13/ 6 s Sd during her iife f that is, in ll^a of her dower, as it 
feemeth) : And the jurors find that he died 26 March, 34 Hen. 8.
and that 
Elizabeth Clifford his daughter was his next heir, then of the age of 15 years f.
Sir Daniel Fleming fays, that Sir I homas Clifford fold this efrate to one 
Fitzwilliam.
To reconcile which account with the aiorefaid inquifition, we 
muft fuppofe that Fitzwilliam (which is not improbable) married the faid 
daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Clifford, and that Sir Thomas fettled the 
eftate in confideration of that marriage to be folemnized.
Fitzwilliam (Sir Daniel fays) fold the fame to one Machel of Kendal ; who 
fold it to Robert Brathwaite of Amblefide efquire, and this brought in the 
family of Brathwaite to Burnefhead.
The anceftor of the Brathwaites both of Amblefide and Burnefhead, and 
alfo of Warcop, was, 
i. Richard Brathwaite of Amblefide efquire; who by his wife Anne

faid, the manor of Burnefhead.
He married Anne daughter of John William-

To his fecond fon James he gave Amblefide ; 
and was fucceeded at Burneihead by his eldeft fon, viz.

To his fecond wife he married Mary daughter of Roger Croft ; and by her 
had iffue Sir Strafford Brathwaite knight, who was killed in the fhip Mary 
commanded by Sir Roger Strickland, in an engagement with an Algerine man 
of war called the Tyger, which fhip Sir Roger took in that engagement.
5. Sir Thomas Brathwaite knight, fon and heir of Richard, married 
Urfula daughter of Sir Jordan Mettam â€¢, and by her had iffue, Thomas who 
died unmarried, Richard, Francis, Edward, Anthony, John, Mark, Lewis, Ur- 
fula, and Margaret.
To his fecond wife he married Elizabeth Nicolfon ; and by her had iffue, 
Philip, Robert, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Frances, Alice, Agnes, and Catharine.
â€” In 
all, 18 children.
He died in 1683, leaving thefe lafl: eight young children in a great meafure 
unprovided for, except what he could leave to them out of his perfonalty.
For he had before made a fettlement of his eftate for payment of debts and 
provifion for his younger children, being fuppofed to be then a widower: for 
he had not then acknowledged his fecond marriage, although he had been for 
fome time married to his fecond wife, who was daughter of one of his fervants.
And after his death, his fon and heir Richard, by various devices and fuits at 
law, attempted to deprive them of all provifion and their mother of dower, 
which he in a great meafure effected.
6. Richard Brathwaite of Burnefhead efquire, fon and heir of Sir Tho- 
mas, married Anne daughter of Sir Henry Waldegrave baronet.
What iffue 
he had we have not certainly found.
In Betham church there is a monument, 
which feems to point out the next in fuccefliori, viz.
7. PIenry Brathwaite of Burnefhead eiquire, who feems to have received 
his chriftian name from the laid Sir Henry Waldegrave.
The infcription on 
the faid monument is this : " Here lies the body of Henry Braithwaite of

The faid Thomas Shepherd fold feveral of the cuftomary tenements to free- 
hold, referving the rent.
All the other eftate at Burnefhead defcended to his 
fon Thomas Shepherd efquire, a gentleman of wit and learning, and eminent in 
his day in the-exercife of the office of juftice of the peace.
He fold the hall, 
and part of the demefne, and corn tithe, to Chriftopher Wilfon of Bardfea in 
Furnefs efquire, who fettled the fame upon his daughter Sarah on her mar- 
riage with John Gale of Whitehaven efquire.
Another part of the demefne, 
called Cowen Head, he fold to lady Fleming (relict of Sir William Fleming 
of Ridal baronet), who fold part thereof to Mr. Thomas Afhburner of Ken- 
dal, who has now thereupon a paper mill.
Burnefhead mills were fold by the 
laid Thomas Shepherd efquire to Mr. Roger Wakefield of Kendal, from whom 
the fame defcended to the prefent owner his fon Mr. John Wakefield.
And 
finally, he fold the manor to the prefent owner thereof Sir James Lowther 
baronet.
The hall is in a very pleafant fituation, on a plain, at the foot of an hill 
â– which rifes with an eafy afcent.
At the time of Mr. Machel's furvey, in the 
year 1692, there was a court, with a lodge and battlements, through which 
the afcent was into the hall.
Before the court was a large pond, on each fide 
of the paffage up to the gate -, and on either fide a little ifland, with a tree 
planted in it.
And in the windows of the gallery and dining-room were ihe 
Brathwaite arms, with impalings of the feveral families to which they were 
related.
The chapel of Burnefhead is common to Burnefhead, Strickland Roger, 
and Strickland KeteL 
To what faint it was dedicated, we have not certainly found.
There is a 
well called the Miller's, formerly St. Ofwald's well, about 30 yards north-eaft 
from the chapel, which probably leads to the name of the tutelar faint.
The 
bell was anciently called St. Gregory's ; but at the confecration or benediction 
of the bells in old time, they had not always the name of the faint of the church 
or chapel given to them, but of other faints occafionally : a well near the place, 
bearing the name of any particular fainr, is a more certain indication of the 
name of the fainc to which the church or chapel was dedicated-, the water 
whereof was reputed facred, and reforted to for the cuie of divers maladies, 
for which an offering was made at the church or chapel, at the altar of the 
tutelar faint.
The original falary belonging to this chapel was 20 nobles-, raifed from the 
inhabitants at fo much a feat.
This indeed was the ancient way of raifing 
jalaries to moft of the chapels, but now the fum is by length of time become 
fettled upon the eftate.
It comes indeed much to the fame thing ; for the 
houfe and feat by law are infeparable.
But this may create a difficulty fome- 
tiuies, where new houfes are erected, or old houfes are fuffered to go down â€¢, 
but

(Bdrneshead.) 
but in this latter cafe it feemeth that the feat fhall belong to the owner of the 
ground where the ancient houfe flood.
The prefent revenue of the chapel is as follows : â€” Ancient falary (being 
part of the faid 20 nobles, the reft by fome means or other being loft) 5 / 17 s 
6d.
â€” Five marks yearly out of three parcels of land in Staveley, which were 
purchafed in the reign of king Charles the firft with money given by Mr. Ro- 
bert Kitchin alderman of Briltol, born in Strickland Ketel, and by Mr. Row- 
land Kitchin of Uoderbarrow : (The refidue of the rents of the faid lands goes 
to the poor.) â€” A rent charge of zos yearly out of an eftate in Strickland Ketel, 
given by Mr. Thomas Atkinfon of Coppackhow.
â€” An eftate in Skelfmergh 
purchafed with 200/ given by the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 100/ 
given by lady Moyer, ancient chapel money 65 /, fubfcriptions in the neigh- 
bourhood 91/ 5 j od\ and to make up the whole purchafe money, which 
was 531 /, there was added 20/ fchool money given by Mr. Alan Bracken, 
and 3 1 / -ancient poor ftock, and the curate Mr. John Towers made up the 
reft, viz, 23/ 15 s od.
Afterwards, Mr. James Hodgfon gave 20/ to the 
chapel, and 10/ to the fchool, to which the curate added 20 s, and therewith 
paid back the poor money.
And for the 30/ fchool money, the fchoolmafter 
receives a proportionable part of the rent.
â€” Another augmentation of 200/ 
was given by the faid governors ; towards the obtaining whereof, the late 
Dr. Stratford's executors gave 100/, and 50/ was raifed by wood fold off 
from the Skelfmergh eftate, and the inhabitants advanced 50 /, which fum 
they borrowed.
With which whole fum of 400 /, an eftate was purchafed in 
Dent in the county of York ; and the prefent curate the reverend William 
Smith applied the mefne profits as they became due, to difcharge the faid fum 
of 50/.
And the two eftates at prefent clear to the curate yearly about 40/.
So that the fum total of the curate's revenue is about 50/ a year.
STRICKLAND ROGER AND STRICKLAND KETEL.
Strickland anciently was always written Stirkland, being no other than 
the pafture ground of the Jlirks or fteers and other young cattle.
At what precife time this Stirkland was divided into moieties, and fo de- 
nominated from the feveral owners, hath not appeared to us.
It feems to 
have been about the reign of king Henry the firft, in the time of Ketel, fon of 
Eldred, fon of Ivo de Talebois firft baron of Kendal.
Roger de Lancajlre above mentioned, baftard brother of William de Lan- 
caftre the third, had large poflefilons given to him by his faid brother, but he 
had not Strickland Roger, for that continued in the legitimate line â€¢, therefore 
Strickland Roger had not its name from him, but from fome other probably 
before his time.
The family*/*?
Stirkland, which finally fettled at Sizergh, had not their name 
from this Stirkland of which we now fpeak, but from Stirkland (which in after

They had indeed certain tenements in Stirkland Ketel holden under the

By the inquifition aforefaid after the death of Joan de Coupland in the 49

it is found, that fhe held of the crown the hamlet of Stirkland Ketel, 
as parcel of the manor of Wyandermere ; and that others held divers lands 
there of her, as parcel of the manor of Kirkby in Kendale.
In the 9 Hen. 8.

At the hamlet of Strickland Ketel it happened, in the arbitrary times we be- 
fore mentioned when fpeaking of king James's proclamation againft tenant- 
right, that another remarkable inftance of the oppreffive meafures of the crown 
glared forth, with refpect to the court of wards and liveries.
And thefe things 
we the rather take notice of, as being fupplemental to the general hiftory of 
. thofe days.
On the death of one Henry Kitchen of Strickland Ketel, a writ 
of Diem claufit extremum was ilTued as ufual, in the 14 Cha. 1.
The efcheator 
fummoned a jury; who found, that the laid Henry Kitchen, whofe heir was 
within age, died feifed of two clofes in Strickland Ketel, which were held of 
the king infocage.
The efcheator William Brifcoe efquire, and the feodary Robert Curwen 
gentleman, not being fatisfied with this finding, certified to the court of wards 
and liveries, that they apprehended the faid clofes were holden of the king by 
â€¢ knights fervice, and not in Jocage.
(The difference was, if the lands were 
holden of the king by knights fervid, the king had the profits of the lands 
during the minority, and the wardlhip and marriage of the heir; if by focage^ 
the king had not this right.) Upon this, it was ordered by the court, that a 
Melius inquirendum fhould iftiie ; and if the efcheator or feodary fhould perceive 
the jury inclinable to find againft his majefty, that then they fhould forbear to 
a take

(Strickland*.) 131 
take their verdict, and adjourn them over to a further day, and bind three or 
four of the moft refractory of them to appear at a day certain at London, and 
receive their evidence at the bar of the court.
Accordingly, a writ of Melius inquirendum was iffued ; and a jury impanel- 
led and fworn.
And upon hearing the caufe, the jury feeming inclinable to 
find againft the king, the efcheator and feodary did not take their verdict, but 
certified to the court, that it appeared upon the inqueft, that the lands men- 
tioned in the former office were holden of the king as of his manor of Kirkby 
in Kendale called the Marquis Fee, by certain yearly rents and fervices ; that 
the faid Marquis Fee (and alfo the Richmond Fee), before it came into the 
crown, was holden of the crown in chief by knights fervice ; that the lands in 
queftion were anciently parcel of the lands of one John Burghe â€¢, and that there 
did not appear any tenure in focage held of the Marquis Fee; that therefore 
they adjourned the jury to appear again at Kirkby Kendal on the 19th day of 
December following, and bound over three of the jury to appear in the mean 
time in Michaelmafs term in the court of wards and liveries, and receive their 
evidence at the bar.
And accordingly, in the faid Michaelmafs term, Miles Sill gentlfeman, and 
Thomas Strickland, two of the faid jurors bound over, appeared in court.
And upon hearing the evidence at the bar, touching the tenure of the faid two 
clofes heretofore John Burghe's lands, the court did conceive, that all the 
lands of the faid John Burghe were holden of the king as of the faid Marquis 
Fee by knights fervice : It was therefore ordered by the court, that if it fhall 
not be made appear by thofe that oppofe the tenure, that the lands in queftion 
are none of the lands in either office found of Burghe's lands, or if the profe- 
cutor for the crown fhall make it appear that rent hath been paid for the fame 
as part of the rent of Burghe's lands; then the jury fhall find a tenure by knights 
fervice : And it is further ordered by the court, that no evidence as touching 
the tenure of Burghe's lands fhall be given to the contrary.
On the 19th of December, the jurors met at Kendal according to their ad- 
journment.
And the order of the court was read unto them.
And upon fur- 
ther hearing, they ftill perfifted in their former opinion.
Wherefore their 
verdict was not received.
And the efcheator and feodary further certify to 
the court as follows ; viz.
That proof was made before them, of a free rent 
having been paid for the faid lands by the faid Henry Kitchen to the king as of 
Burghe's lands : But that fome deeds without date being produced of lands in 
Strickland Ketel held in focage of the Marquis Fee, the jury were inclined to 
find againft the king : "Whereupon, they the faid efcheator and feodary, in- 
almuch as the cafe concerned divers other freeholders holding of the Marquis 
Fee by knights fervice, adjourned the jury again to appear before them at Ken- 
dal on the 13th day of March following.
- 
This certificate being delivered to the court, and the attorney- general being 
heard on behalf of the king, the faid court on the 6th of February did order, 
that if at the faid next meeting the jurors fhould not find the tenure according 
to the direction of the aforefaid order and decree, the efcheator or feodary 
fhould bind over two of the jurors to appear in court, at their own proper 
S 2 charges, 
132 PARISH OF KENDAL.
(Strickland*.) 
charges, at a day certain this term, to receive the further order of the court 
thereupon-, and that the payment of 10/ ordered to Miles Sill and Thomas 
Strickland two of the jurors, for their attendance to receive the evidence at the 
bar the laft term, be fufpended until the office be found.
At the faid next meeting on the 13th of March, the jurors refilling to find 
for the king â€¢, the efcheator and feodary adjourned them again, and bound over 
Henry Fiiher and James Awdland, two of the faid jurors, to appear in the 
court as above ordered : Who appearing accordingly, on the 16th.
of May, 
the court did finally order and decree, That the jurors at their next meeting 
{hall find the lands in queftion to be holden by knights fervice, without hearing 
any evidence at all to the contrary *.
â–  
We fhall make no obfervation upon this ; but only felicitate our coun- 
try, that juries are not treated in; this manner in our days ; and that this court 
of wards and liveries, and all the incidents thereof, were aboliffied by act of 
parliament foon after the reftoration of king Charles the fecond.
It coil the 
nation dear, if any thing could be dear for lucha purchafe ; for they gave the 
excife for it.
And bifhop Burnet obferves, that the exchange was made, be- 
fore either party knew or had confidered thoroughly what it was they parted 
with.
Thomas Brathwaite of Burneftiead efquire, by his will dated 18 Feb. 1606, 
gave 10/ for a ftock for relieving poor houfholders in Strickland Ketel and 
Strickland Roger ; to be lent to them without intereft yearly, by the church- 
wardens and overfeers of the poor refpectively, and the owner of Burneftiead 
Hall for the time being.
The abbey of Cockerfand had lands in Strickland Roger, called Huxdbcw % 
â€¢where anciently was a chapel called Chapel k wood: but there are now icarce 
any footfteps thereof remaining.
In Strickland Roger was heretofore a family of the name of Gcdmond, who 
gave name to an ancient tower houfe, which i till bears the name of Godmond- 
Hall; and is now the property of John Burn efquire.
Part of the houfe hadi 
been rebuilt, but the tower remaineth in its original form, having been in- 
tended as a place of fecurity and defence.
The walls are two yards in thick- 
nefs or upwards, and firmly cemented.
The windows fmall, and crofied witli 
ftrong bars of iron.
The loweft floor is arched over T and the next above that 
laid with mafiy boards or planks grooved into each other, to prevent affaults 
from above.
For the predatory parties did not proceed by way of fap or un-

and let themfelves down by ropes and ladders.

LONG SLEDDALE.
Long Sleddale, like the reft, belonged to the ancient barons of Kendale.
They granted in fee divers tenements there to feveral perfons, and finally 
granted the manor to the Thornburgbs of Hamsfel and Selfide, who fold the 
fame to Bellingbam, who fold to Colonel James Grahme, from whom the fame 
hath defcended to the prefent earl of Suffolk and Berkfhire.
In the reign of king Henry the third, William de Lancaftre, baron of Kendal, 
enfeoffed Rotvland de Renegill of 29 acres of arable land in Sleddale, and pailure 
there to the value of 100 s.
He alfo enfeoffed Gilbert de Bereburn of 20 acres 
of land there.
And he enfeoffed Robert de Leyburne (to whom alfo he gave 
Skelfmergh) of three acres and an half in Sleddale of meadow ground, and 
pailure there alfo.

of Kendal, in focage, by fealty and the rent of 6 d a year for all fervices â€¢, and 
that the fame were of the clear yearly value of 12 / 4J 4^.
The tenements have been from time to time all or moft of them enfranchifed.
Here is no manor houfe, for the lords of the manor, fo far as we have found, 
never refided at this place.
When the Thornburgbs had the manor, the tenants 
attended the court at Selfide Hall.
The moft confiderable houfe in the dale was Ubery-halJ, having an ancient 
rower, and the walls two yards thick.
This feems to have been part of that

one of the Harringtons paid to queen Katherine a free rent of is for Ubarrow 
Hall.
The chapel ftands about the middle of the dale, and was made paroch'al by 
bifhop Dawes in 1712.
The ancient lalary thereof is 5/25 10 d.

In 1746, an augmentation of 200/ of queen Anne's bounty by lot fell to 
this chapel, which was laid out in the purchafe of a freehold eftate in Long 
Sleddale, now worth 12/ a year or upwards.
So that the whole annual revenue is about 27/ a year.

This place hath its name from the river Kent, which fprings there, and from

fifter had that which is now called the Lumley Fee â€¢, and Ladarine the fourth 
lifter had Kentmere.
This Ladarine was married to Johnde Bella-aqua, and had ifiue two daughters 
coheirs ; Sibil married to Miles de Stapleton, and Johan married to Aucherus fon 
of Henry.
The faid Miles de Stapleton, by Sibil his wife, had a fon Nicholas de Stapleton, 
between whom and the faid Johan (his aunt) in the 5 Ed. 2.
a partition was 
made in chancery of the inheritance ; by which partition, the manor of Kent' 
mere (befides divers eftates in Yorkfhire therein mentioned) were to remain to 
Nicholas.
The faid Nicholas had a fon and heir Miles de Stapleton, who in the 21 Ed. 3.
paid his fine to the king for his relief; and amongft other particulars, for a 
certain chafe called Kentmere, which Nicholas father of the faid Miles held of 
the king in capite, by hereditary defcent after the death of Miles Stapleton grand- 
father of the prefent Miles, as the third part of the inheritance of Peter de 
Brus in the barony of Kendaje, being that part which had belonged to Lada- 
rine fourth daughter and coheir of Peter de Brus, which came to the faid Miles 
the grandfather in right of Sibilla his wife firft daughter and heir of the faid 
Ladarine.

And the jurors fay, that the faid Thomas died without heir male vr * 
of his body, and that the fa;d Brian is heir of the faid Thomas of the manor * 
aforefaid by the intad aforefaid : And that Elizabeth wife of Thomas de Metham 
knight is lifter and heir of the faid Thomas de Stapleton, and of the age of 24 
years and upwards.
The faid Brian had a fon Thomas de Stapleton, who lived in the reign of king 
Henry the fixth.
And on an inquifition of knights fees in the fixth year of 
that king, it was found, that Thomas de Stapleton (then in wardfhip of the 
king), fon and heir of Brian de Stapleton, held of the king in capite Kentmere 
in Kendale with the appurtenances, by the fervice of the 4th part of one 
knight's fee *.
This manor of Kentmere continued in the name and family of Stapleton till 
the reign of king Charles the firft; when Gilbert Stapleton, in the year 1626,.
fold the fame to Nicholas Fijher of Stanebank Green gentleman.
The arms of Stapleton were ; Argent, a lion rampant Sable.
Henry Fijher, a defcendent of the faid Nicholas Fijher, devifed the manor of 
Kentmere to be fold ; and the fame was accordingly purchafed, in the year 
1745, by Thomas Wiljon of Kendal gentleman, by whom it was devifed to his 
younger fon the prefent owner Thomas Fenwiek efqu ire; which name of Fenwick 
he took by act of parliament, in purfuance of the laft will and teftament of 
Robert Fenwick of Burrow-hall in the county of Lancafter efquire.
The whole number of tenements originally in this manor was fixty; that 
is, the lands were apportioned and fet out for the fuftentation of fixty foldiers : 
and the veftiges of this eftablifhment yet remain.
The manor is divided into 
four quarters ; each quarter into fifteen tenements ; each tenement confifts of 
a proportionable quantity of inclosed ground, with pafture for ten cattle in a 
common pafture lying within each quarter refpectively, and privilege for 80 
iheep in another pafture common to the whole manor; and for each tenement 
a man ferves the office of conltable, pays 2 s a year to the curate of the cha- 
pel, and 13 j A,d rent to the lord of the manor.
So where a man has two te- 
nements, he ferves the office of conftable two years; or if he has half a tene- 
ment, he joins with another who has alfo half a tenement, for the finding a 
conftable for one year.
And fo of the reft in like proportion.
One of which 
ancient military tenements, at the prefent improved value, may be deemed to 
be worth about 10/ a year.
Having deduced this manor of Kentmere, from its firft feparation from the 
barony of Kendal at large to the prefent time, we find no room for a family: 
which hitherto hath been fuppofcd to have been lords of this manor for fe- 
veral generations.
Inhabitants within Kentmere they undoubtedly were, and 
had a confiderable eftate there ; but lords of the manor they could not be.

Biihop Carleton, in his life of that eminent preacher Bernard Gilpin, begins 
Vf * his account of this family with Richard Gilpin, who (he fays) in the time of 
"' â€” ' king John had Kentmere given to him by one of the barons of Kendal, for his 
extraordinary fervices both in war and peace.
And this is that Richard (he 
fays) who fignalized himfelf in killing a wild boar, which had infefted the 
neighbouring parts, and done much mifchief.
In memory whereof, the Gil- 
pins bear in their arms a boar to this day.
That there was fome perfon of this name who performed fuch exploit, is 
very probable, as well from the faid bearing on their efcutcheon, as from uni- 
verfal tradition.
But that the baron of Kendal at that time gave Kentmere 
unto him, cannot be aflerted.
Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred had then 
the whole barony, and it continued intire for many years after that.
And 
when Kentmere at laft was feparated from the reft, it spaded to a grand- 
daughter of the faid Gilbert, in whofe pofterity it continued (as hath appeared) 
till the reign of king Charles the firft, and then pafled into other hands.
So 
that the Gilpins never had the manor of Kentmere.
The manfion-houfe, which 
is called Kentmere-hall, they had, and alfo a confiderable eftate in land ; but 
not fo early (as it feemeth) as the reign of king John.
The learned prelate 
above mentioned obferves, that Richard was the fixth anceftor in the afcending 
line from the faid Bernard who flourifhed in the reign of queen Elizabeth, 
which comprehends the fpace of about 350 years-, and it will fcarcely be 
found in any inftance that fo few defcents have happened in fo long a tract of 
time.
The higheft that we can reafonably afcend in the fixth degree upwards 
from the faid Bernard, is to about the reign of king Edward the third, and 
the evidences that have occurred to us feem to favour this calculation.
1. The firft in their own family pedigree is the aforefaid Richard Gilpin, 
who is fuppofed to have killed the wild boar above mentioned.
He had a fon,

fufed, though ftrongly folicited to accept it by his kinfman Edwin Sandes bi-

There is alfo another eftate at Lane-head in Crook be- 
longing to this chapel, of the yearly value of 5/, but by whom given is not 
known.
Winster, though it is in the parifli of Kendal, yet is faid to be in the 
conftablewick of Undermilbeck in the parifh of Windermere ; probably be- 
caufe the tenements were holden of the Philipfons of Calgarth in Undermil- 
beck.
The lad Philipfon of that place left four daughters, Mary, Frances, 
Jane, and Clara-, who fold the manor in 171 7, to John Taylor and Miles 
Birket both of Winder, who conveyed to the feveral tenants reflectively, fub- 
jecl: only to the payment of a free rent to the crown.
The chapelry of Winder was anciently a part of the chapelry of Crook ; 
and the inhabitants of Winfter ftill pay towards the repairs of Crook chapel.
The original falary of Winfter chapel was certified in 1 717, at 3/19J od.
To which alfo belongs an inclofure of meadow ground lying in Winfter, given 
by Mr. Knipe in the year 1617.
Alfo to the faid chapel belongs an eftate in 
Cartmel Fells, purchafed with 200/ which came to it by lot from queen Anne's 
bounty in 1720.
And an eftate in Dent, purchafed in 176c, with 400/; of 
which fum 200/ was contributed by the governors of the faid bounty, 100 /by 
Dr. Stratford's executors, and 100/ by divers other benefa&ors.
The whole 
yearly revenue of the faid chapel now amounts to about 25 / a year.
Part of Cartmel Fells, though in another parifh and county, pays to the 
curate of this chapel, as part of the chapelry, for the eafe and convenience of 
thofe parts, being far diftant from their mother church.
This place gives name to the rivulet called Winfter Beck j which almoft 
from head to foot divides Weftmorland from Lancafhire.
UNDERBARROW and BRADLEY FIELD.
This is the laft divifion that remains to be fpoken of in the parifh of 
Kendal.
Underbarrow hath its name from its fituation under the barrow, hill, or 
fear, which extends from north to fouth all along in this divifion.
That part which is called Bradley Field received its denomination from a 
family of the name of Bradley, which came from Bradley in Lancafhire.
They 
had alfo pofftffions in the parifh of Betham.
The laft of whom, viz.
John 
Bradley married Anne daughter of Robert Brathwaite of Amblefide efquire, 
and by her had iflue three daughters coheirs : 1 .
Elianor, married to John 
Ofbaldefton of Ofbaldefton in the county of Lancafter efquire.

This family of Layburn zxConfwick in this divifion hath been very ancient, 
and a very confiderable family in the county.
The fuccefTion whereof in a 
chronological feries, fo far as we have been able to make it out (though we 
cannot vouch for it as a regular pedigree all along from father to fon), is as 
follows :

of king Henry the third, William de Lancaftre, baron of Kendal, granted 
Skelfmergh.
He had a fon, 
2. John de Leyburne ; who had a fon, 
3. Nicholas de Leyburne, whofe wife's name was Margaret ; for in the 9 Ed. 1.
a fine was levied, between Nicholas de Laybourne and Margaret his wife, and 
John de la Chamber and Sibil his wife, of certain lands in Skailfmer, Syzar, 
and Strickland Ketell ; to hold to the faid Nicholas in fee.
In the 33 Ed. 1.

efquire.
The faid Thomas died Aug. 5.
in the 2 Hen. 8.
and by an inquifition on the

There was an ancient chapel at this place, and the falary belonging to the

GRESMERE CHURCH AND MANOR.
/GRESMERE is fuppofed by fome to have had its name from the grajfy 
^* mere or lake there.
But anciently it was never written Grafmere (much 
lefs Grafmire) ; but moft commonly Grefmere, fometimes Grifmere.
From 
whence one might conclude, that it received its name from the grife or wild 
fwine, with which this country formerly abounded.
In like manner as in the 
adjoining parifh of Barton, there is Grifedale, Boardale, Stybarrow, and fuch 
like.
In Kentmere, Richard Gilpin is fuppofed to have fignalized himfelf as 
aforefaid for killing a wild boar, which infefted all the neighbouring parts.
The parifh of Grefmere is bounded on the Eaft by Patterdale in the parifh 
of Barton, from which it is divided by the very ridge or top of the moun- 
tains ; on the South, by the parifh of Windermere, from which it is divided 
in part by Stockbridge water ; on the Weft, by Furnefs Fells in Lancafhire, 
from which it is divided by the river Brathey â€¢, and on the North, by part of 
Cumberland, from which it is divided by the ridge of mountains called Lang- 
dale Fells, as the water runs off to each fide of the mountain.
The church is dedicated to St. Ofwald, as is fuppofed, from a well called 
St. Ofwald's near unto the church.
It is rated in the valuation in the king's books in the 26 Hen. 8.
at 28 /

This parifh (as alfo that of Windermere) was originally a chapelry only

When the church of Kendal was appropriated 
to the abbey of St. Mary's York, a penfion was appointed to be paid out of 
Grefmere to the faid abbey of \l \%s 4 d.
But the chapel continued in the 
patronage of Ingelram de Gynes and Chriftian his wife, in the 30 Ed. 1.
Accordingly, in the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland, the 
inquifition finds, that fhe died feifed of the advowfon of the chapel of Grifmere, 
which was then valued at 10/.
In the 3 Hen. 8.
the king nominated to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's 
near York walls, under the great leal, John Frojl to be prefented unto the 
chapel of Grefmere, being then void by the refignation of Hugh Afhton.
And in the 16 Hen. 8.
the king nominated William Holgill to the faid 
chapel.
After the diffolution of the monafteries, the patronage of this chapel was 
granted to the Bellinghams.
And in the 16 Eliz.
Man Bellingham efquire, for 
the fum of 100/, fold the fame to William Fleming of Ridal efquire, in whofe 
family the advowfon thereof ftill continues.
The church of Grefmere is fituate in the midft of a large plain, encompaffed 
almofi round with high mountains.
It is a pretty large building, with a ftrong 
fteeple and three good bells.
The owners of Ridall-hall have a peculiar bury- 
ing-place in the faid church.
The parfonage-houfe {lands about 40 yards weft from the church, on the 
north fide of the river Raifbeck, which runs by the church, near the end of 
the parfonage houfe.
It was rebuilt by Dr. Henry Fleming, rec~lor thereof, in 
the year 1 69 1.
At the north-eaft corner of the church-yard, there is a fchool, which was 
built about the year 1685, at the expence of the inhabitants, and endowed by 
Mr. Ambrofe then rector with 50/.
Anthony Dawfon of Grefmere gave 7 /.
The intereft thereof to go towards the fupport and maintenance of a fchool- 
mafter.
The manor of Grefmere is now efteemed a diftincT: manor, like as the cha- 
pelry hath obtained the name of a parifh.
But heretofore the manor was parcel 
only of the manor of Windermere.
Thus in the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland aforefaid, the 
inquifition finds, that the faid Joan died feifed of the manor of Wynandermere, 
with its members and appurtenances j and, amongft the reft, the hamlet of 
Grifmer.
In the 14 Eliz.
after the death of William Parr, marquis of Northampton, 
the inquifition finds, that he died feifed of and in the manor of Grefmere, and 
of divers meffuages, lands, and tenements there.

The faid inhabitants pay alfo for the rent of four water-mills now decayed

That which belonged to the queen is of the Richmond fee: For Grefmere 
feems to have been near equally divided ; as by the inquifition in the 28 ("ha.
2. 
when queen Catherine was in poiTeflion of both the Marquis and Richmond 
fees, it appears, that in Grefmere there were 39 cuftomary tenements of the 
Marquis fee, of the yearly rent of 1 1 / 6 s 2 d â€¢, and 15 tenements of the Rich- 
mond fee, of the yearly rent of 61 12 s 4^.
In a rental (now at Sizergh-hall) of the crown lands in the barony of Kendal, 
in the 7 Hen. 7.
whereof Sir Thomas Strickland was then fteward, amongft 
the particulars of rents for two parts of the faid lands, due to (the king's 
mother) Margaret countefs of Richmond and Derby (the third part belonging 
to the duchefs of Bedford in right of dower), there was ifTuing out of Grefmere 
a rent called for eft filver 44 s $d ob.
a rent called brewefarme Sd, and a rent 
called goldewether yd ob.
q. â€” So, out of Langden; forejl filver 33 s 4 d, golde- 
welher ^d.
â€” In like manner, Loughrigg paid fore ft ft 'her 8 d, goldewether %d q.
and a tent called walking filver 4.S $d ob.
The forejl filver was for agistment 
of cattle in the foreft.
Walking filver feems to have been a compofition for 
puture of the forefters or other officers whofe bufinefs it was to perambulate 
and furvey.
Brewefarm by fome is underftood to be a rent paid for licence 
to brew and fell ale and beer; for the lord of the manor in moft places had ju- 
rifdi&ion of the affize in that refpect : But as the word bruer fignifies alfo heath 
or ling, perhaps this might be a payment for the privilege of getting ling for 
fuel.
As to goldwether, we have not found any account of it, except in this 
and fome other rentals of the fame lands about that time : pofiibly, as the/0- 
r eft filver was for the agiftment of cattle, fo goldwether might be for the agift- 
ment of fheep.
Within this manor there are feveral tarns or meresy of which, the moft con- 
fiderable is Grefmere-water, into which the river Raifbeck empties itfelf, after 
a courfe of about three miles, from Rafegill-head where it fprings, down by 
Dunmal Raife, and thence weftward down the dale, and fo by the fide of the 
church and parfonage as aforefaid.
Out of which water of Grefmere, runs a 
river, which taking its courfe through Rydal water, maketh the river Rowthey â€¢, 
and fo pafiing by Amblefide, it lofeth itfelf, with the river Brathey, in Win- 
dermere water.
Dunmcl Raife aforefaid is a large mountain, a great part whereof is in this 
parifh, over which the highway leadeth from Kefwick by Amblefide unto 
Kendal.
It is fo called from a great heap or raife of ftones, by the highway

Rydal, Sir Daniel Fleming fuppofes to be a contraction of Rcwthey-dak,

This manor was granted to Roger de Lancaftre before mentioned, by Mar-

coheirs of Peter de Brus who married Helwife fifter and coheir of William de 
Lancaftre the third of that name, baron of Kendal.
In which grant, the

The faid Roger in the 3 Ed. 1.

'verbatim ; fo as the faid Roger and his heirs have and hold the faid foreft, and 
the aforefaid part of Amelfate and Lochrigg, and all other things in the faid

He died without iffue male; leaving four 
daughters coheirs, 1.
Chriftian, married to Sir Robert de Harrington knight.
2. Ifabel, married to Sir Thomas le Fleming of Conifton knight, with whom he 
had Rydai.
3. Margaret, married to Sir Matthew de Whitfield knight.
4. Eli- 
zabeth, married to Robert de Crackenthcrp efquire.
Rvdal being thus brought into the name and family of Fleming, we pro- 
ceed to deduce the hiftory of that ancient family; for which we are furniflied 
with ample materials, by the large and valuable collection made by Sir Daniel 
Fleming baronet ; whofe account of his own family is extracted from the family 
evidences and other authentic documents.
There leems to be no doubt, that the firft of the name who had pofTefiions 
in England came in with "William the conqueror, out of Flanders.
I. The firft Fleming that hath appeared to us, by any record or other authen- 
tic inflrumenr, was Michael le Fleming knight, in fome writings called 
Flandrerjis : Unto whom William de Mefchiens, brother to Ranulph de 
Mefchiens who lived in the time of the conqueror, gave Beckermet, Frifington, 
Rotington, Weddikar, Arlochden, Kelton, Salter, and Brunrigg, in Cum- 
berland.
This Michael and his pofterity had commonly in records and writings le 
prefixed to their furname, until the time of king Edward the fourth : which 
helps to confirm the obfervation cf Camden, that de and le were ftriclly ob- 
ferved in fome local names, until about that time.
When Stephen earl of Boulogne (who was afterwards king of England) 
founded the abbey of Furnefs in the year 1 126, he granted to the faid abbey 
whatsoever was in Furnefs, except the land of Michael Flameng.
Which grant 
was confirmed by pope Eugenius, with the like exception.
This Sir Michael refided commonly at Beckermet, where was a cattle an- 
ciently, called by the common people Caernarvon caftle.
He was alfo lord of 
the manors of Aldingham and of Glefton in Furnefs in the county of Lan- 
2 carter.
i 5 2 PARISH OF GRES MERE.
(Rydal.) 
cafter.
And as he fometimes alfo refided at Glefton, he received from thence 
the name of Michael de Furnefs : On the contrary, he gave the name of Mtt- 
cbel-land (or Michael-land) to a great part of Furnefs, which continues to be 
fo called to this day.
In the 1 9th year of king Stephen, he granted Fordebote to the faid abbey of 
Furnefs; and foon afcer died, and was buried in the faid abbey, wherein moft 
of the nobility and gentry in thofe parts were interred, as was very ufual alfo in 
other places, many bequeathing their bodies, together with a legacy, to the 
religious houfes ; and others defiring not only to be buried near the monks 
habitations, but alfo in their very habits.
He had iffue five fons and one daughter.
1. William^ to whom he gave the manor of Aldingham and caftle of Glef- 
ton, with other poffeffions in the county of Lancafter.
2. Richard^ to whom he gave his cattle of Caernarvon and manor of Becker- 
met, with the homage and fervice, wards and reliefs, of all the freeholders in 
Frifington, Rotington, Weddikar, Kelton, Salter, Arlochden, and Brun- 
rigg aforefaid, with other poffeffions in that county and in the county of Lan- 
cafter, which are yet enjoyed by his pofterity and iffue male, lineally for the 
moft part, and fometimes collaterally for want of iffue male in the elder 
branch.
3. Daniel^ a clergyman*, who had the church of Urfwic referved to him, 
upon his father's exchange of Ros and Crinelton for Bardfey and Urfwick, 
with the abbot of Furnefs.
4. Anfelm, who affumed the furname de Furnefs.
He was living in the 13th 
year of king John.
He married Agnes daughter of Alice wife of Edgar, and 
had half of Yanewith with her in marriage.
5. Jordan, who alfo took the name de Furnefs.
6. Godith ; with whom her father gave in marriage 3 carucates of land in 
Adgarefslith.
The prefent family at Rydall proceed from Richard the fecond fon, who 
(as aforefaid) was fettled in Cumberland.
And it is this branch that we are 
chiefly to purfue.
The elder branch, who enjoyed the Lancafhire eftate, con- 
tinued owners thereof in a regular hereditary fucceffion of males and females, 
till it arrived as it were at the foot of the throne, in the perfon of Henry Grey 
marquis of Dorfet and afterwards duke of Suffolk, father of the lady Jane Grey.
Which branch we will firft briefly deduce ; and then return to the younger 
branch, with which we are more particularly concerned.
The eldeft fon of Sir Michael aforefaid was ( 1 ) William le Fleming of Fur- 
nefs knight, who after the death of his father enjoyed the manor of Aiding - 
ham, the caftle and manor of Glefton, with other lands in the county of Lan- 
cafter and elfewhere, which had belonged to the faid Michael his father ; and 
he inhabited for the moft part at Glefton caftle.
(2) Sir Michael le Fleming of 
Furnefs knight, fon and heir of William.
He had a fon, (3) William le 
Flemings who had iffue, (4) Sir Michael le Fleming knight, who in the reign 
of king Henry the third was drowned in Leven, and died without iffue, and 
left his whole eftate to (5) Alice, his only filter and heir.
She married Richard

(6) William de Cancefield, Ton C H A P.
and heir of Richard and Alice, died without ifllie ^ and was fucceeded by his , ^l.
^ 
filler and heir, (7) Agnes de Cancefield, who was married to Robert de Harring- 
ton of Harrington in Cumberland, in the reign of king Edward the firft, and 
carried the eftate to that family.
Though the family of Harrington at firft: 
aflumed their furname from that place, which they had held of long time, and 
continued to poffefs, till the heir female thereof married to the lord Bonvil; 
yet after this marriage, their chief feat was at Glefton caftle and Aldingham.
The faid Agnes de Cancefield to her hufband Robert de Harrington had iffue 
(8) John de Harrington, who in the 34 Ed. 1.
was knighted ; and having been 
fummoned to parliament as a baron from the 18 Ed. 2.
to the 21 Ed. 3.
he 
died in that year.
This John had a fon (9) Robert de Harrington, who died 
before his father, having married Elizabeth one of the filters and coheirs of 
John de Multon of Egremont, and by her had a fon and heir (10) John de 
Harrington, who fucceeded his grandfather, and died in the 37 Ed. 3.
leaving; 
iffue (11) Robert de Harrington, his fon and heir, who refiding at Aldingham 
in the firft year of king Richard the fecond, was knighted at his coronation.
He married Ifabel daughter and coheir of Sir Nigel Loring knight of the gar- 
ter, and left iffue by her (12) Sir John Harrington knight, his eldeft fon and 
heir; who died in the 5 Hen. 4.
without iffue, and was fucceeded by his bro- 
ther and heir (13) Sir William Harrington knight; who married Margaret 
daughter of Sir Robert Nevil of Hornby.
He was fummoned to parliament 
from the 8 Hen. 5.
to the 15 Hen. 6.
He had an only child (14) Elizabeth 
Harrington, who was married to William lord Bonvile, who died in his father's 
lifetime, leaving a fon (15) William Bonvile junior, commonly called William - 
lord Harrington ; who married Catherine one of the daughters of Richard Nevil 
earl of Salifbury, and was (lain in the battle of Wakefield on the part of the 
houfe of York in the 39 Hen. 6.
leaving only a daughter, viz.
(16) Cecilie, 
married to Thomas Grey marquis of Dorfet, and afterwards to Henry Stafford 
earl of Wiltfhire.
She had to the faid marquis of Dorfet a fon (17) Thomas 
Grey, marquis of Dorfet ; who married Margaret daughter of Sir Robert Wot- 
ton knight (widow of William Medley), and died in the 22 Hen. 8.
leaving 
iffue (18) Henry Grey, marquis of Dorfet; who married Katherine, daughter 
cf William Fitz-Alan earl of Arundel, but had no ifllie by her.
Afterwards 
he married the lady Frances, eldeft daughter of Charles Brandon duke of Suf- 
folk by his wife Mary the French queen.
Andforafmuch as the lady Frances's 
two brothers died without iffue, this Henry her hufband was created duke of 
Suffolk.
By her he had three daughters, Jane, Katherine, and Mary.
The 
lady Jane, the eldeft, was proclaimed queen, after the death of king Edward 
the fixth, and foon after beheaded.
Her father, for countenancing the faid 
proclamation, was beheaded on Tower-hiil in the fecond year of queen Mary, 
and the whole eftate, in Cumberland, Lancafhire, and elfe where, became for- 
feited to the crown, and was granted out to divers perfons, whofe pofterity or 
affignees enjoy the fame to this day.

Having thus given an account of the faid Sir William le Fleming and his heir?, 
and of the feveral owners of Glefton caftle, Aldingham, and the reft of his 
eftate, we proceed to his next brother, viz.
II.
Sir Richard le Fleming of Beckermet in Cumberland knight, fecond 
fon of Sir Michael.
This Sir Richard had alfo fome lands in Lancafhire given 
to him by his father; for Sir Michael had other eftates there, befides thole of 
Michel-land, Aldingham, and Glefton, which he gave as aforefaid to his eldeft 
fon.
To this Sir Richard, William de Skelfmerefergh by feveral deeds without 
date granted divers lands in Lancafhire, with the fifhery of Thurftan-water : 
to which deeds his elder brother William de Furnefs is a witnefs.
He died in the reign of king John, and was buried with his father and 
brother in the abbey of Furnefs ; and was fucceeded by his only fon and heir, 
III.
Sir John le Fleming of Beckermet knight.
By a deed without date, 
this John conveyed to his fon Richard, all the land of the faid John which his 
father had given him in Coupland, with the homage and fervice of certain 
freeholders which then held of the faid John, viz.
the homage and fervice of 
Sir Alan de Peninton and his heirs for Rotingen, of Sir Robert de Lamplogh.
for half of Harlofden and for Brunrigg, of William de Wedaore for two parts 
of Wedacre, of Sir Adam de Haverington for the third part of Wedacre, and 
of Ralph de Frifington for Frifington, with wards and reliefs, and all other 
liberties thereunto belonging.
And by feveral other deeds, he conveyed to 
him other lands in Cumberland.
WitnefTes to which deeds (amongft others) 
were, Robert prior of St. Bees, Sir Patrick de Wirkington, Sir Adam de Mil- 
ium, Sir Richard de Coupland, and Sir Hugh de Morriceby.
He gave alfo the patronage of the redory of Arloghden, and land in Great 
Beckermet, to the abbey of Caldre, in the 26 Hen. 3.
And the rectory and advowfon of the church of St. John Baptift of Becker- 
met was granted to the faid abbey either by him or his father-, which was con- 
firmed by the archbifhop of York, about the year 1262.
And the archbifhop 
at the fame time annexed the church of St. Michael of Arlokedene to the arch- 
deaconry of Richmond.
He alfo conveyed other lands in Lancafhire to divers perfons : WitnefTes 
whereof were, the prior of Kertmel, John prior of Cuningfheved, Sir William 
de Furnas, William fon of Orme, Matthew de Redeman, Thomas deBethun,

He died in the reign of king Henry the third, and was buried in the abbey 
of Calder, to which he had been a benefactor.
Sir Daniel Fleming fays, there 
was to be feen in his days at the faid abbey a very ancient ftatue in free flone 
of a man in armour, with a frett (of fix pieces) upon his fhield, lying upon his 
back, with his fword by his fide, his hands elevated in a pofture of prayer, 
and his legs acrofs ; being fo placed probably from his taking upon him the 
crofs,

crofs, and being engaged in the holy war.
Which ftatue was placed there moft 
probably in memory of this Sir John le Fleming.
He left a fon and heir, 
IV.
Sir Richard le Fleming of Beckermet, knight.
He married Eliza- 
beth filter and heir of Adam de Urfwick and John de Urfwick her two brothers ; 
whofe father was Adam de Urfwick, Ion of Gilbert, fon of Adam, fon of Ber- 
nulf.
By which marriage, the faid Richard got the manor of Coningfton 
[King's-town] â€¢, and other pofTeflions in the county of JLancalter ; which have 
continued in his heirs male to this day.
By a deed without date, John brother of the faid Elizabeth granted to the 
faid Sir Richard le Fleming and the faid Elizabeth all the lands which had been 
Adam de Urfwick's his brother, in Urfwick, Coningfton, Claughton, and 
Kerneford, in exchange for other lands.
Witneffes ; Roger de Lancaftre, John 
de Cancefield, John de Kirkby, Richard de Kirkby, and others.
In the 52 Hen. 3.
a writ of trefpafs was brought by Ifabel de Fortibus coun- 
ters of Albermarle, againft Roger de Lancaftre, Richard le Flemings Gilbert 
de Culwen, Ranulph de Dacre, and others.
After this marriage, the caftle of Caernarvon was fuffered to go to decay, 
and at laft demolifhed, and the demefne lands let to cuftomary tenants : And 
the family removed to Coningfton hall, where they refided for feveral gene-, 
rations.
He died, leaving a fon and heir, 
V. John le Fleming of Coningfton â€¢, who in the 28 Ed. 1.
was in the ex- 
pedition then made into Scotland, being with the king when he was in perfon 
at Carlaveroke, fituate upon the very mouth of Solway, accounted an impreg- 
nable fortrefs; which king Edward, accompanied with the flower of the Eng- 
lifh nobility-and gentry, befieged, and with difficulty took.
During his ab- 
fenceout of the kingdom, John had a protection from the king, dated at Car- 
laveroke 10 July, 28 Ed. 1.
of his people, lands, goods, rents, and other 
pofieilions, and freedom from all fuits and plaints, until Eafter following.
He had iffue two fons, Raynerus and Hugh : Which Hugh had a daughter 
Mary, married to Ralph de Frifmgton.

He gave to the abbot of St.
Mary's York, two oxgangs of land in Rotington, and alio one villein in the 
fame town : Which was confirmed by king Edward the fecond, in the firft year 
of his reign.
Raynerus had the appellation of dapifer added to his name ; perhaps as being 
purveyor of the king in thefe northern parts.
He left iflue,

Sir John le Fleming of Coningfton, knight.

Richard de Hodlefton and Gilbert de Culwen did then hold Milium and Work-

(Rydal.) 
ington of the faid Thomas', and that John fon of Rayner le Fleming held or?
the faid Thomas the hamlets of Beckermet, Frifington, Rotingtoi, Wedacre,.
and Arlocden,.
by homage and fealty and fuit of the court of Egremont, and 
by the fervice of the ninth part of one knight's fee, and 5; 6/f a year for 
cornage, and 2 s $d for watch of the fea, and by the puture of two ferjeants 
of the faid Thomas every ninth day at his manor of Egremonr.
The lords of the minor of Beckermet do yet pay yearly o,s i,d of the free 
rents above mentioned, to the owner of Egremont caftle : And aU the refidue 
of the aforefaid rents are yearly paid by the freeholders of Frifington, Roting- 
ton, Wedacre, and iVrlocden.
That this John le Fleming was lord of Beckermet in the 19 Ed. 2.
and was 
related to Hugh le Fleming above mentioned, and to the Frifingtons, appears 
by an intail of the manor of Frifiagton made by Hugh le Fleming unto Ralph 
de Frifington and Mary his wife for their lives, and then to Thomas their fon 
and the heirs of his body, and then to Alice and Agnes their daughters' and 
the heirs male of their bodies ; and for want of fuch, then to John le Fleming 
lord of Beckermet and his heirs.
He had iffue two fons â€¢, and one daughter Joan, who was married to John 
k Towers of Lowick, whofe arms were, Argent, on a bend Gules, three

VIII.
The elder fon of the faid Sir John was William le Fleming of 
Coningfton.
He died without iffue, either before his father, or foon after.
For, 
Sir John le Fleminc of Coningfton knight, fecond fon of the laft Sir- 
John, appears to have been heir to his father in the 7th year of king Edward 
the third.
By an inquifition taken at Ulverfton, after the death of this Sir John, it 
appears, that he died in the 27 Ed. 3.
and that on the day on which he died 
he held of the king in capile (which had been of the fee of William de Coucy) 
the manor of Coningfton with the appurtenances, and a certain hfhing there 
in Thurftan water â€¢, that he had two marks rent iffuing out of Claughton, 
holden of John de Croft ; forty acres of land at the Water-end, holden of 
John de Haverington by a pair of white gloves for all fervices ; and that Richard 
le Fleming was his fon and heir, then of the age of 30 years.
Befides this fon Richard, he had alfo Robert le Fleming a fecond fon.
IX.
Sir Richard le Fleming of Coningfton knight, fon and heir of the 
laft Sir John, married Catherine daughter (or fifter) of Sir John de Kirkby in 
the county of Lancafter knight j whofe arms were, Argent, two bars Gules, 
on a canton of the fecond a crofs moline Or.
By his faid wife he had iffue, Thomas, John, James, and a daughter Joan % 
Which Joan in the 44 Ed. 3.
releafed unto her father all her lands in Cumber- 
land and Lancafhire, which had been her grandfather's \ which deed fhe con- 
cludes thus, " And becaufe my feal is not known to many, I have procured

after, and was fuc- 
ceeded by 
X. Sir Thomas le Fleming of Coningfton knight, his eldeft fon and heir- 
This Sir Thomas married firft Margaret daughter of William de Berdefey, as â–  
appears by a deed in the 47 Ed. 3.
whereby Sir Richard, father of the faid 
Thomas, grants to him and to Margaret his wife daughter of William de Ber- 
defey and to the heirs of their bodies the manor of Beckermet, remainder to 
his own right heirs.
The Berdefey's arms are, Argent, two bars Gules : On

By her he had no iflue.
He afterwards married Ifabel daughter of Sir Thomas Layburne knight ; ; 
and had ifiue by her, Thomas le Fleming his fon and heir, and John le Fleming^ 
his fecond fon.
Sir Thomas Layburne in the marriage articles did covenant to give with his 
laid daughter for her portion 80 marks in filver and fufficient rayment; where- 
upon the manor of Beckermet and lands in Ur-fwick were intailed upon the 
laid Sir Thomas le Fleming and Ifabel his wife and their heirs male j and for 
want of fuch, then upon John le Fleming his brother.
There appears a releafe to have been executed by him in the 1 2 Hen. 4.
How foon after he died, is not known.
But it appears he was dead in the 
6 Hen. 5.
his wife Ifabel being then a widow.
XI.
Sir Thomas le Flemimg of Coningfton knight, fon of Sir Thomar 
by his wife Ifabel Layburne.
He married, in his father's iife-time, Ifabel 
daughter and coheir of Sir John de Lancafter of Rydal and Howgill caftle ; and 
this was the firft introduction of the Flemings into Westmorland.
In the mar- 
riage articles it was covenanted, that Sir John her father ihould pay 80 marks 
for his daughter's portion, and that Sir Thomas father of the faid Thomas 
Ihould fettle the manor of Coningfton and all other his lands on his faid fon and 
his heirs male ; and for defect of fuch, then upon John le Fleming younger 
brother of the faid Thomas and his heirs male-, and for want of fuch, then 
upon the right heirs of the faid Sir Thomas : And that if the faid Thomas the 
fon fhould die without heirs of the body of the faid Ifabel, then that John his 
younger brother aforefaid mould marry another daughter of the faid Sir John 
de Lancafter, without any other portion or fettlement.
But the faid Thomas and Ifabel had children; and the other three daughters 
of Sir John de Lancafter married other perfons (as is above mentioned), and 
after his deceafe his eftate was divided amongft them ; in which divifion, the 
manor of Rydal and all the faid Sir John's lands and tenements in Rydal and 
Loughrigg acceded to the two daughters, Margaret wife of.

They afterwards 
purchafed the Whitfield moiety â€¢, and Rydal from henceforth became the chief 
feat of the Fleming family, and their pofteriiy have ever fince enjoyed it.
The laid Sir Thomas, by his wife Ifabel de Lancaster, had iffue Jobn> and 
a younger Ion William.

John Fleming cf Rydal, efquire.
After the death of the faid Sir 
Thomas le Fleming and dame Ifabel de Lancafter his wife, the aforefaid de- 
mefnes and manors of Beckermet, Coningfton, and Rydal, and all their other 
eftate in Cumberland, Lancaihire, and Weftmorland aforefaid, came unto this 
John their fon and heir.
This John, in the 7 Ed. 4, was retained by indenture, according to the 
cuftom of thofe times, to ferve the lord of Grayftock, who was often em- 
ployed in the king's fervice againft Scotland : The form of which retainer was 
as follows : " This indenture made the 9th day of December in the 7th year 
" of the reign of king Edward the 4th, betwixt Rauff lord Grayftock and 
" Wemm on the ton party, and John Fleming efquire on the todir party,

John Fleming of Rydal efquire, fon and heir of John.
He married a 
daughter of Sir Hugh Lowther of Lowther knight, whofe name was Joan ; yet 
after his death we find his widow called Janet.
For the reconciling of which, 
it is to be oblerved, that according to Camden, in late years fome of the better 
and nicer fort, mifliking Joane, have mollified the name into Jane-, for Jane is 
never found in old records, and (as fome will have it) not before the time of 
king Henry the eighth.
In the 32 Eliz.
it was agreed by the court of king's 
bench, that Jane and Joan are all one.
Janet is a diminutive of Joan, as little 
or pretty Joan.
This John had iffue Hugh Fleming efquire, his fon and heir.

In the 4 Hen. 8.
there was an award between Alexander abbot of Furnefs 
of the one parr, and this John Fleming of the other part, made by Brian Tun- 
ftal, John Lowther of Lowther, John Lamplogh of Lamplogh, and William 
Redmayne of Thwyfil-towne, efquires ; which was, that they mould each fhevv 
their writings to the next judge of affize at Lancafter, who mould determine, 
whether the faid John Fleming held the manor of Coningfton by knights fer- 
vice and a certain rent of the faid monaftery ; and alfo that the faid abbot 
fhould pay to the faid John Fleming, for all fuch titles and tenant-rights as 
the laid abbot claims in Furnefs-fells, except Crag-houfe, the fum of 40/.
In rhe 6 Hen. 8.

She alio purchafed Monk-hall, and divers other meffuages and tenements in 
the county of Cumberland ; all of which, after her deceafe (or before) came 
into the family eftate.
This John was a juflice of the peace for Weftmorland from the 7 Jac.

By whofe death without iffue, his two fillers portions be- 
came augmented to 10000/ each j but the family eftate went over to his uncle 
Daniel the next heir male.
Young as this William was, he appeared in arms on the king's party.
And 
after his death, the fequeftrators put both his and his father's name into their 
bill of fale, in the year 1652.
Which put his heirs male to great charge and 
trouble afterwards, to get the eftate cleared from the then commonwealth's 
title.

XVIII.
William Fleming of Skirwith and Rydal efquire, fon and heir

On the death of the laft William without iffue as aforefaid, this

furrendered to David Lefley in about 9 months after, having firft endured 
all the extremities of famine.
Upon the coming in of duke Hamilton, he again accepted a commiffion of 
lieutenant colonel of a regiment of horfe, whereof John Lamplugh of Lamp- 
lugh efquire was to be colonel.

XIX.
Daniel Fleming of Rydal efquire, afterwards knight and baronet, 
fon and heir of William j author of the aforefaid memoirs, from which this 
account is chiefly taken.
He entered dommoner in Queen's college in Oxford in 1650, under the re- 
verend Thomas Smith afterwards bifhop of Carlifle.
Chriftopher Mufgrave 
efquire, fecond fon of Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet, was then of the fame 
college.
And Dr. Gerard Langbaine was provoft.
Daniel had for his fer- 
vitor Jofeph Williamfon fecond fon of the reverend Jofeph Williamfon vicar of 
Bridekirk in Cumberland, who afterwards became fellow of the faid college, .
was recommended by the.faid Mr. Smith to Sir Edward Nicholas, and after- 
wards was knighted, and promoted to the office of fecretary of ftate ; he v/as 
one of the king's plenipotentiaries at Colen j and married one of the blood 
royal, namely, Catherine only fifter to Charles Stuart duke of Richmond, 
widow of Henry lord Obrian, fon and heir of Henry earl of Thomond in 
the kingdom of Ireland, At the fame time Sir George Fletcher of Hutton 
baronet was a ftudentand fellow commoner in that college.
In the year 1653, this Daniel got poffeffion of the manors of Rydal, Con- 
ningfton, and Beckermet, which had hitherto been under fequeftration; Rydal 
hiving been leafed out by Mr. John Archer and other committee-men at Ken- 
dal to Walter Strickland efquire, uncle to the two daughters of John Fleming 
efquire fifteis of William aforefaid, who died without iffue ; thole two daugh- 
ters claimirg as heirs to their father and brother, againft this collateral branch 
who ciaimea by virtue of the intail.
But he did not get the whole compleated 
till the latter end of the year 1634.

In 1655, he married Barbara fifter of Sir George Fletcher aforefaid, eldefl C H A P.
daughter of Sir Henry Fletcher of Hutton baronet (who was killed on the v, Â« 
king's party at Routon-heath battle near Chefter in 1645) and of the lady " 
Catherine Fletcher his wife, eldeft daughter of Sir George Dalfton of Dalfton 
in Cumberland knight.
In the fame year he purchafed the remaining part of the manor of Kirk- 
land, which had not been compleated by his father.
He was the firft fheriif of Cumberland after the reftoration of king Charles 
the fecond ; and was knighted by that king in the year 168 1, for which he 
paid as the ufual fees to the officers 78 / 13 s \d.
He continued in the intereft of that family till the reign of king James the 
fecond ; when finding the eftablifhed religion to be in danger, he joined with 
the party that oppofed that king's meafures ; and being one of the two bur- 
geffes in parliament for Cockermouth in the firft year of the faid king, he 
voted againft the court.
His election to that borough was contefted, yet fuch.
was the moderation of thofe times, that his whole expences in that concert did 
not amount to 20/.
Towards the latter end of that king's reign, Sir Daniel in the aforefaid 
memoirs gives a very curious account of the attempt made by the court for 
taking away the penal laws and teft.
He begins with a letter to himfelf from 
Sir John Lovvther of Lowther (who, as reprefentative for Wefcmorland, had 
voted in parliament for the bill of exclufion, and was ftrenuous in oppofing 
the meafures then carrying on for introducing the popifh religion and arbitrary 
power).
There had in the former reign been fome differences between the 
two families of Lowther and Rydal, which Sir John Lowther firft endeavours 
to reconcile, in order that they might join together in the fame common caufe.
And Sir Daniel's narrative proceeds as follows : 
Letter from Sir John Lowther of Lowther to Sir Daniel Fleming.
S I R, 
HAVING had the pleafure of late to underftand from feveral hands, but 
efpecially from Sir John Lowther [of Whitehaven], that you ftill retain a 
friendship for our family; and fince I am willing to hope, that whatever mif- 
under'flanding was betwixt us happened rather by miftake, or for reafons 
which are now removed, than for any thing elfe : I would no longer forbear 
afluring you, that I have no greater pleafure than to live well with all people,, 
and efpecially with my relations and ancient friends.
And fince you have tor- 
merly fhewed yourfelf fuch upon many occafions,.
I cannot but wifh that there 
may be the fame mutual good offices as formerly.
And if whiift Sir John 
Lowther is here, who hath always been a friend of yours, you pleaie to vifit

At the fame time Sir John Lowther of Whitehaven writ to Sir Daniel by 
the fame mefTenger as followeth : 
S I R, 
I CANNOT leave the country without returning you my acknowledg- 
ments for your great civilities to both me and my fon at the affizes, and for 
the continued teftimonies of your friendfhip upon all occasions ; and if our 
whole family have not had of late the fame advantages thereof that I have 
enjoyed, it is not unknown how great a trouble it has been to me, nor how 
often I have wifhed to be the happy instrument of reftoring the good corre- 
fpondence betwixt fo near relations.
This, Sir, not I alone, but the whole 
country, I find, and all good men, have equally defired, and I doubt not to 
fee the wifhed fuccefs ; fince I can allure you, the fame friendfhip that ever 
was on our fide we do defire may be renewed and continue as long as the fa- 
milies: which, by the freedom wherewith you were pleafed to declare your- 
felf to me at Carlifle upon this fubjec"t, is, I hope, what will be rroft welcome 
to you.
The inclofed from Sir John himfelf will fpare me the adding any 
more, and I hope bring you over whilft I flay, which will be" till Monday 
next.
And I pray bring your fon with you, that the young men may fix their 
acquaintance.
I am, Sir,

and humble fervant, 
John Lowther.
Thefe two letters arriving at Rydal lare in the evening, and Sir Daniel 
Fleming's two fons being gone two days before to vifit their filters in Lan- 
cashire, and Sir Daniel thinking it neceffary to fpeak with Sir Chriftopher 
Mufgrave (who was lately come into the country from London, and had writ 
to Sir Daniel to meet him at Carlifle the week following), he returned the fol- 
lowing anlwers to the faid two letters by the mefTenger who brought them, 
rather than go forthwith unto Lowther.
His anfwer to the former letter was 
thus : 
SIR, Rydal, Aug. 24, 1687.
I THANK you for your very obliging letter, which I have this evening 
received, and for your kind invitation unto Lowther ; and I fhould now have 
waited upon you and Sir John Lowther according to your defires, had not my 
two fons (William and Daniel) been gone into Lancashire with my fervants 
and horfes.
I do concur with you, that whatever mifunderftanding was be- 
twixt us, happened rather by miftake than for any thing elle.
For I ever had 
a friendfhip for yourfelf and family ; and without taking any further notice of 
what is paft, upon my part fhall be performed the fame mutual good offices as 
formerly.

In anfwer to Sir John Lovvther of Whitehaven, he writ as follows: 
S I R, Rydal, Aug. 24, 1687.
I HAVE even now received yours, with one from Sir John Lowther; 
and I have made him fuch a return as I hope will be fatisfaclory unto you both.
I am troubled that I cannot wait on you before your leaving this country, and 
that my fon is no better acquainted with my coufin Lowther.
I fhall ever ac- 
knowledge my great obligation unto you for your conftant friendfhip, and for 
the many favours which I have received from you.
And if I may be anv way 
ferviceable unto you here in the country, I hope you will favour me with your 
commands.
My humble fervice unto yourfelf and my coufin your fon, heartily 
wifhing you both a fafe return unto London.
My fon William and his brother 
Daniel are now in Lancalhire, which hinders me now from telling you in per- 
fon that I am, Sir, 
Your very affectionate kinfman' 
and molt faithful fervant, 
Dan. Fleming.
In the mean time, Sir Daniel Fleming had an interview with Sir Chriftopher 
Mufgrave ; who had been difplaced fome little time before from the office of 
lieutenant of the ordnance for refufing (as it was faid) to promife the king to 
give his vote for taking away the teft and penal laws.
' About the fame time, 
the king had removed the earl of Derby from being lord lieutenant of the 
county of Lancafter, and put into his place the lord Molineux ; and had alfo 
removed the earl of Thanet from being lord lieutenant of the counties of 
Weftrnorland and Cumberland, and put into his place the lord Prefton.
And that the king's declaration for liberty of confeience might the more 
tafily pafs into a law, the council agreed on the three queftions following : 
1. If in cafe you fhall be chofen knight of a fhire, or burgefs of a 
town, when the king fhall think fit to call a parliament - t whether you 
will be for taking off the penal laws and tefts ?
2. Whether yOu will affift and contribute to the election of fuch mem- 
bers, as fhall be for taking off the penal laws and tefts ?
3. Whether you will fupport the king's declaration for liberty of con- 
feience, by living friendly with thofe of all perfuafions, as fubjects of the 
fame prince and good chriftians ought to do ?
The feveral lords lieutenants were ordered to defire the anfwers of all de- 
puty lieutenants and juftices of the peace within their refpe&ive lieutenancies, 
to each of the aforefaid queftions in particular.
And the lord Mollineux at Lancafter, in the beginning of November fol- 
lowing, having propofed the faid queftions to thejuitices there-, they anfwered 
feverally as followeth : viz.
Mr. Girlington, that he would have thofe laws 
damned, with the contrivers of them.
Mr. Prefton agreed to take away the 
fanguinary laws only.
Mr. Cams was for having thofe laws burned, as the 
Scotch covenant was.
Mr. Curwen Rawlinfon anfwered, No. Captain Kirkby 
and his uncle William Kirkby were for the affirmative ; and fo were colonel 
4 Roge?

(Rydai.) 
Roger Sawry and Mr. Henry Weft.
But Mr. Cole, Mr. Bradil the fon, Mr.
Knipe of Broghton, Mr. Copley, Mr. Jofeph Fletcher, and others, were ne- 
gatives.
Sir Robert Bindlofs appeared not, writing a letter negatively, and 
afterwards another letter otherwiie.
Edward Wilfon junior efquire anfwered, 
that he would Speak by his representative in parliament; and when the king 
fhould pleafe to call one, he would do his endeavour to chufe a loyal man ; 
and was of opinion that none ought to Suffer for mere matters of religion.
At 
Liverpool, only four or five, who were cuftom-houSe officers, were for the 
affirmative.
At Wigan, two only ; and no more at Prefton, where colonel 
Rigby, co'ond Rawftorne, and many more, were negatives.
At Clitheroe, 
all were alfo for the negative.
The lords lieutenants of divers counties having not met with that fuccefs 
they expected, occafioned the printing the following declaration : 
Whitehall, Dec. n, 1687.
His majefty, having by his gracious declaration of the 4th April laft, granted 
a liberty of confcience to all his Subjects ; and refolving not only to maintain 
the fame, but to ufe his utmoft endeavours that it may pafs into a law, and be- 
come an eftablifhed Security to after ages; hath thought fit to review the lifts 
of the deputy lieutenants and juftices of the peace in the feveral counties: 
that thofe may be continued, who fhall be ready to contribute, what in them 
lies, towards the accomplishment of So good and necefTary a work; and Such 
others added to them, from whom his majefty may reafonably expect the like 
concurrence and afliftance.
The lord Prefton's occafions would not give him leave to make Such hafte 
into the country, as many other lords lieutenants did.
But in January Sol- 
lowing, he writ letters to every deputy lieutenant and juftice of the peace within 
the counties of Westmorland and Cumberland as followeth : 
SI R, 
I DESIRE you will meet me at Penrith upon Tuefday the 24th of this 
month, about ten of the clock in the morning ; I having Some matters to im- 
part to you by his majefty's command.
I am, Sir, 
Your moft humble Servant, 
Preston.
To the letter Sent to Sir Daniel Fleming, his lordfhip added this poftScript 
with his own hand : 
I fhould be very glad to See you at Hutton, before the meeting at Penrith.
I hope to be there on Thurfday come Se'nnight.
My humble Service to Mr.
Fleming; and believe me to be, Sir, 
Your moft affectionate and humble Servant, 
Preston.
Sir Daniel Fleming having received lord Prefton's letter, and his Son ano- 
ther letter from his lordfhip, and Sir Daniel having not yet vifited Lowther 
iince Sir John Lowther and he were made friends (although he was much 
preffed to make thatjourney by Sir John Lowther of Whitehaven), Sir Daniel 
thought

(Rydal.) 169 
thought it not amifs for him to take Lowther in his way to Penrith, which he C H A P.
did on Jan. 21, being accompanied thither by his two ions William and Daniel, V1 - 
and by his coufin John Brougham ; where they v/ere all very kindly entertained 
by Sir John Lowther and his lady ; and where Mr John and Sir Daniel did agree 
upon their anfwers to the aforefaid queftions.
On the 23d, Sir Daniel Fleming, his fon Daniel, and his coufin Brougham, 
went early to Hutton; where they dined, and would have returned that even- 
ing unto Lowther, but the lord Prefton would not permit them, obliging them 
to (lay there all night â€¢, from which place they waited (with fome other gentle- 
men) the next day upon his lordfhip who rode on horleback unto Penrith; whi- 
ther came Sir John Lowther, in his coach with fix horfes, attended by Sir Da- 
niel Fleming's eldeft fon, and the reft of the deputy lieutenants and juftice> of 
the peace for the counties of Cumberland and Weftmorland, fave tome who 
were fo indifpofed in health that they could not lately travel fo far from home.
The lord Prefton having defired the gentlemen then prefent to take their 
places at a long table in the George inn at Penrith, and his lordfhip in a fhort 
fpeech having acquainted them with his majefty's appointing him to be lord 
lieutenant of the two counties, and with the reafons of his lordfhip's defiring 
them to meet him there ; he defired them in his majefty's name, either to de- 
liver their feveral anfwers unto the three queftions aforefaid in writing, or that 
they would permit his lordfhip to call in his fecretary to write the fame.
Upon 
which, all being filent a good while, Sir John Lowther ftood up, and ac- 
quainted his lordfhip, that he conceived it would be more for his lordfhip's 
eafe, to permit every gentleman to write his own anfwer : Which was feconded 
by Sir Daniel Fleming, adding, that if his lordfhip would give leave to the 
gentlemen there to withdraw into fome other place for about one hour's time, 
then every one would come to his lordfhip with their feveral anfwers in writ- 
ing under their hands.
Which was forthwith affented unto.
And the prote- 
ftant gentlemen did go into one room, and the papifts into another.
Within an hour's time all were ready with their anfwers ; and then return- 
ing to his lordfhip, and taking again their places at the table, Sir George 
Fletcher ftood up and read aloud his anfwer, which was pretty long, confent- 
ing to indulge tender confciences ; but as to the teft, referring it to the de- 
bate of the houfe : and declaring that he would ftand for a knight of the 
county of Cumberland.
Sir William Pennington read alfo his anfwer, con- 
fenting to indulge tender confciences, and to take away the tefts, fo far as it 
fhall not be prejudicial to the church of England.
Then Sir John Lowther 
read his anfwer, which was as followeth : 
1. If I be chofen a member of parliament, I think myfelf obliged to refer 
my opinion concerning the taking away the penal laws and tefts, to the reafons 
that mall arife from the debate of the houfe.
2. If I give my intereft for any to ferve in the next parliament, it fhall be 
for fuch as 1 fhall think loyal and well affected to the king and the eftablifhed 
government.
3. I will live friendly with thofe of feveral perfuafions, as a loyal fubjecl: and.
a good chriftian ought to do.

Anthony Hutton, Edward Mufgrave, Henry Brougham, Thomas Denton, 
Chriftopher Richmond, and Edward Haflel efquires, gave in the fame an- 
fwers verbatim as Sir John Lowther did, only with the change of their feveral

Francis Howard, Thomas Brathwaite, William Fletcher,

All thefe anfwers

All which being done (our author adds) his lordmip treated all the gentlemen 
very kindly and nobly, with wine, ale, and a good dinner.
Soon after this meeting, the lord Prefton writ to every of the abfenf gentle-

â€” This Sir William, from his

performed it, by incorporating the particle with his fon's chriftian name at his 
baptifm : who thereby bears the fame name with the firft founder of the family 
after the conqueft, viz.

Sir Michael le Fleming of Rydal baronet, now knight of the

It is intended by the prefent owner to be rebuilt.
It is fituate on the 
iide of an hill, with a pleafant profpect over mod of the vale, and over part of 
"Winandermere, which is faid to be the greateft (landing water in England.
Nigh to the hall runs a rivulet on the eaft fide called the Gill, which exhibits 
a natural cafcade ; and a little below it on the fouth fide, the river Rowtha 
faketh its courfe, which probably gave name to this dale, and runneth by 
Amblefide into Winandermere.
This country abounds with wood, which is much ufed in the iron works.
The demefne belonging to the lord of the manor is very considerable ; in 
which is a large park, for which a charter was obtained in the reign of king 
Edward the firft, but i-t hath now no deer in it.
Here was alfo another park 
called the Low-park, but that hath been difparked a long time ago 
Upon the top of a round hill, on the fouth fide of the highway leading from 
Kefwick to Kendal, was anciently placed the manor-houfe or hall near to the 
faid Low-park.
But upon the building of the other hall, on the north fide of 
the faid highway, near unto the High-park, the faid manor-houfe became 
ruinous, and got the name of the Old Hall, which it ftill beareth ; where is 
now to be feen nothing but the ruins of buildings, walks, and fifh ponds; 
and the place where the orchard was, is now a large inclofure without ever a 
fruit tree in it, now called the Old Orchard.
In the highway at the end of the old orchard, was a caufway, which was 
charitably made by John Bell, curate and fchoolmailer of Amblefide ; every 
Thurfday and Saturday in the afternoon caufing his fcholars to gather (tones 
for the paving thereof, and lie did then pave the fame himfelf.

LANGDALE AND BAISBROW.
Langdale is divided into Great Langd 'ale and Little Longdate-, the former 
being held under the crown as parcel of the manor of Wincjermere â€¢, the latter 
hath been granted off, and hath for a long time been enjoyed by the Penning- 
tons of Moncafter, who fold moft of the tenements to freehold about the year 
1692-, of the reft, the feigniory was purchafed by John Philipfon of Cal- 
garth efquire.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland aforefaid, the inqui- 
fition finds, that fhe died feifed of the manor of Winandermere with its mem- 
bers and appurtenances, and amongft the reft the hamlet of Langden.
In the 14 Eliz.
the inquifition finds, that William Parr marquis of North- 
ampton died feifed to him and his heirs male of the manor of Langden, and 
of divers meffuages and tenements in Langden.
And in the particulars of the dower affigned to his widow, one Item is, 
Langden: Total of the yearly rent there, %l 6s iod.
The tenants and 
inhabitants of Langden pay for a parcel of wafte ground for their common 
unto the lords of the fame 5 /; whereof to the queen 50^, to my lady marquis 
37 s 6 d, and to Mr. Gilpin 12 s 6 d.
The faid tenants pay yearly to the lord 
for greenhue at his court 2 d, or elfe 1 d and an hen, amounting in all to 
lis 10 d." 
The chapel ftands in Great Langdale, but it belongs aifo to Little Langdale 
and Baifbrow, The ancient falary thereof is 61 4s 3d, which feems origi- 
nally, like as in many other of the chapelries, to have been 20 nobles, or 6 / 
13 j 4-d.
There is alfo an houfe and fmall parcel of ground belonging there- 
to, of the yearly value of 2 /.
In 1743, queen Anne's bounty of 200/ fell to 
it by lot, with which an eftate was purchafed in the parifh of Ulverftone, with 
the addition of 51 / 4 s poor ftock, for which the poor receive one fifth part 
of the rent.
In 1767, another lot of 200/ fell to the faid chapel, wherewith 
an eftate was purchafed in Little Langdale.
The whole revenue of the chapel 
amounts to about 2 1 / a year.
In Little Langdale is a place called Chapel mire, where it is faid a chapel for- 
merly flood, which was removed and united to that of Great Langdale.

(Langdale.) 
Tn Langdale are two high hills, in the road from Cumberland to Grefmere, 
called Hardknct and Wreynofe* the latter being fo denominated from its crook- 
ednefs.
Upon the latter of which mountains are placed the {hire (tones, being 
three little flones, near the highway, of about a foot high, and a foot from 
each other, fet in a triangle, where the counties of Wcitmorland, Cumber- 
land, and Lancafter do all meet together in a point, each of the laid flones 
being in one of the three counties aforefaid.
In Little Langdale is got fine blue flatej large quantities of which are lent 
off to London and other places.
Basebrowne (as it was anciently called) is within the conttablewick of 
Langdale, which was given by William de Lancaftre baron of Kendal, to the 
prior and convent of Coningfhead in Lancafhire.
The principal eftate therein 
was made up of feveral tenements purchafed by Mr. Gawen Brathwaite, and 
fo made into a demefne.
The tenants belonged to the Benfons, and were fold 
by John Benfon to Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide.
In which name they 
continued, till they came into the hands of Miles Atkinfon, by his marriage 
with Dorothy daughter and heir of Robert Brathwaite of High-houfe in Hu- 
gill, brother and heir of Thomas, fon and heir of Gawen, fon of Thomas the 
purchafer.
Eagles and ravens fometimes build in this chapelry.
Ambleside is part in this parifh, and part in the pariih of Windermere; 
and we defer to treat thereof until we come into that pariih.
Which here 
next follows.
PARISH OF WINDERMERE.
r X , HE pariih of Windermere hath received its denomination from the fa- 
mous mere or lake therein.
From whence the lake itfelf hath derived its 
name, is not certain.
Some have imagined it to be fo called from the great 
winds which pour down upon it from the mountains ; others from its winding 
and turning-, but Sir Daniel Fleming's conjecture feems to be molt probable, 
that it hath received its name from the proper name of a man, as well as that 
of Thurftan water (now called Coninglton water) in Lancashire, and that of 
Ulfe's water (now called Ulfwater) in the confines of W T eftmorland and Cum- 
berland.
This pariih is bounded on the Eaft by Kentmere in the pariih of Kendal ; 
on the South, by Crooke and Winfter in the laid parifh of Kendal, and by 
Cartmell fell in the county of Lancafier-, on the Welt, by the bailiwick of 
Hawkfhead in the faid county of Lancafter (fo that the whole lake is in this 
parifh)-, and on the North, by the parifh of Grefmere.
The church is dedipated to Sr. Martin ; and is a rectory, valued in the king's 
books at 24/ 6 s 8 d.
It was certified to the governors of queen Anne's 
t>ounty at 78/: viz.
parfonage houle and land 30 /; compofitions, tithes of 
wool 
PARISH OF WINDERMERE.
177 
wool and lamb, and other fmall tithes 44/; furplice fees 4/.
But the decluc- CHAP, 
tions reduced the fame to jil ys id; amongft which deductions were, to vr * , 
the receiver of the crown rents 1/ 13 s 4^, and to the vicar of Kendal 
13 s 4</.
Anciently, this parifh, in like manner as that of Grefmere, was part of the 
pari(h of Kendal ; but by length of time it hath obtained the reputation of a 
diftincl: parifh.
At the appropriation of the church of Kendal to the abbey of St. Mary's 
York, the patronage of this chapel (as it was called) was not given to the faid 
abbey as was that of the church of Kendal, but the fame remained to Ingelram 
de Gynes and Chriftian his wife, grantees of the crown.
But there was a 
penfion of 33 s \d paid out of this chapel to the faid abbey.
By the inquifition pojl mortem of Joan de Coupland in the 49 Ed. 3.
it is 
found, that fhe held by grant of the king during her life the advowfon of the 
chapel of Wynandermer, valued at icoj.
And in token of fubje&ion, the 
rector of Windermere pays to this day an annual penfion of i$s 4^ to the 
vicar of Kendal.
The patronage and advowfon of this church feems to have continued in the 
crown till the 7th year of queen Elizabeth, when the fame was granted to 
William Herbert and John Jenkins, to hold of the queen in free focage by 
fealty as of the manor of Eaft Greenwich.
And after feveral mefne convey-, 
ances, the fame was purchafed by the late Sir William Fleming baronet, who 
by his laft will and teftament devifed the fame to his four daughters.
There are four townfhips or conftablewicks in this parifh ; Undermilbeck, 
Applethwaite^ Troutbeck, and Amblefide^ part of which laft (as aforefaid) is in 
the parifh of Grefmere.
I. 
UNDERMILBECK.
Undermilbeck is divided from Applethwaite by the brook which carries a 
mill there, from whence it receiveth its name â€¢, as Applethwaite may be ftyied 
Overmilbeck.
This moft commonly goes by the name of the manor of Windermere.
But 
the manor originally was much larger, extending through feveral townfhips 
which were parcels thereof.
Thus after the death of Joan de Coupland aforefaid the inquifition finds, 
that fhe died feifed of Wynandermer y with its members and appurtenances, to 
wit, the hamlets of Langden, Loughrigge, Grifmer, HameUide, Troutbeck, 
Applethwaite, Crofthwaite, Stirkland Ketel, and Hoton.
It is of the Richmond fee; and in the 4 Ed. 3.
Chriftian de Lindefey ob- 
tained a charter of free warren in Windermere.
And in the 14th year of the 
fame king, William de Coucy obtained a like charter of free warren there.

(Undermilbeck.) 
On the furvey made of the queen's lands, in the 28 Cha. 2.
it was found, 
that in Undermilbeck there were 8 1 tenements' of the Richmond fee, of the 
yearly rent in the whole of 13/ Ss odl ' 
There are fome few tenements in this divifion which pay rent and fine to 
other perfons befides the king, by grant probably from the crown in former 
times.
At the diflblution of the monafteries, there was a tenement- in Winander- 
mere which belonged to Shap abbey, then in the pofleflion of Ifaac Dixon ; 
and for which the owners of Thornborrow-hall paid a yearly rent of 5 s to the 
lord Wharton, whofe family had a grant from the crown of the pofleffions of 
the faid abbey.
Part of Undermilbeck is called Bownefs, anciently Bulnefs ; in which ftands 
the church ; which is an handfome large building, with two rows of pillars, a 
fquare tower with 3 bells and a faint's bell.
Anciently there was an organ -, 
but it was demolifhed in the civil wars in the reign of king Charles the firft.
There is a large quire window, with excellent coloured glafs therein, which 
glafs (it is faid) belonged to Furnefs abbey, and after the diflblution of the 
faid abbey was purchafed by the parifhioners of Windermere, and placed here 
in their church.
The window confifts of feven compartments or partitions.
In the third, fourth, and fifth, are depicted, in full proportion, the cruci- 
fixion, with the Virgin Mary on the right, and the beloved difciple on the 
left fide of the crofs : Angels are exprefled receiving the facred blood from the 
five precious wounds : Below the crofs, are a group of monks in their proper 
habits, with the abbot in a veftment: Their names are written on labels if- 
fuing from their mouths j the abbot's name is defaced, which would have 
given a date to the whole.
In the fecond partition, are the figures of St.
George and the dragon.
In the fixth is reprefented St. Catharine, with the 
emblems of her martyrdom, the fword and wheel.
In the feventh are two 
figures of mitred abbots, and underneath them two monks drefled in veft- 
ments.
In the middle compartment, above, are finely painted, quarterly, 
the arms of England and France, bound with the garter and its motto, pro- 
bably done in the reign of king Edward the third.
The reft of the window is 
filled up by pieces of tracery, with fome figures in coats armorial, and the arms 
of feveral benefactors, amongft whom are Lancafter, Urfwick, Harrington, 
Kirkby, Preflon, Middleton, and Milium *.
The Flemings paternal coat 
(viz.
Gules, a frett of fix pieces Argent) is in divers parts of this window, 
ibme of them with a file of five points or lambeaux ; which began to be ufed 
about the reign of king Edward the firft, as a difference for the eldeft fon, 
the father being living.
The parfonage houfe is called the hall \ there being no other gentleman's houfe 
in the village of Bownefs.
It ftands in a pleafant fituation, which is rendered 
more agreeable by Windermere water on the north and weft fides thereof, 
upon the banks of which the glebe land lies for near half a mile in length,

being about 40 acres, reaching from the houfe to the water fide.
It is a good CHAP, 
houfe : Part of it was rebuilt by Mr. Richard Archer, formerly fellow of i ^^_ 
Queen's college in Oxford, rector thereof; and another part by Mr. William 
Wilfon taberdar of the faid college: And it hath received confiderable im- 
provements by the prefent worthy rector Mr. Giles Moore, elder fon of John 
Moore of Grimefhill in this county efquire.
The fchool alio is fituate in the village of Bownefs, at a fmall diftance from 
the church.
There was a flock of 200 1 raifed for the fupport of a fchool- 
mafter by contribution of the inhabitants of Undermilbeck and Applethwaite.
A fchool houfe alfo was erected by a like contribution, about the year 1637.
It is governed by four truftees and ten feoffees.
In 1677, the truftees were 
Robert Philipfon of Calgarth efquire, William Wilfon rector of Windermere, 
Thomas Dixon of Orreft-head, and Robert Birket of Lickbarrow ; whole re~ 
fpective heirs or fuccefifors are to fucceed in this office for ever.
The feoffees 
are to be chofen out of the reft of the mod fubftantial inhabitants in both the 
faid hamlets, and when one half of them is dead, the furvivors chufe others to 
fill up the number, and then new fecurity is drawn between the truftees and 
feoffees.
And an eftate was purchafed with the contribution money, which is 
now worth about 1 5 / a year.
By a further agreement in 1762, it was fettled, that the rector, and the 
owners of Rayrigg, Lickbarrow, and Berkthwaite eftates, for the time being, 
fhall be truftees of the faid fchool.
Thomas Dixon of Fulbarrow, in the year 1730, gave 20 s yearly ifluing out 
of the faid eftate, for books to be diftributed to poor children taught at the 
laid fchool: ard alfo 20^ to the ufe of the poor of Undermilbeck.
John Kirkby of Lindeth gave 5 /, the in.tereft whereof to be diftributed in 
like manner.
Francis Bonack of Bought in this parifh, in the 14 Cha. 1.
gave by his will 
100/ to the poor of this parifh, wherewith an eftate was purchafed in Nat- 
land, now of the yearly value of ill 18 s od> to be difpofed of in the fol-

APPLETHWAITE.
Applethwaite exprefieth its own derivation.
It is a long ftraggling ham- 
let, like many of the reft, or rather a number of fingle houfes, each houfe 
being fituate as is molt convenient for the lands about it.
And in this refpect 
thefe dales have the advantage of towns and villages, where the lands are fre- 
quently intermixed, and fome of them a* a confiderable diftance.
It is an 
intire conftablewick.
The river Troutbecfc runs at the high end of it, on 
the weft fide thereof.
The great road from Kendal to Kefwick goes through 
it ; and near this road, at a place called St. Catharine's Brow, was an ancient 
chapel, now converted into a dwelling-houfe, but it may yet be diftinguifhed, 
Handing eaft and weft, and having an end window (as in other chapels) now 
walled up.
Applethwaite is of the Richmond fee; and on the furvey made of the queen's 
lands in the 28 Cha. 2.
it appeared, that in Applethwaite there were 62 tene- 
ments, of the yearly lord's rent in the whole of 24/ 10 s ioj;d.
Sir Daniel Fleming takes notice of a cuftom in this hamlet which is fomewhat 
extraordinary.
Every tenant's wife below the faid highway pays Â§d yearly, 
and every other woman above 1 6 years of age 2 d, to the king, as lord of the 
manor.
Above the faid highway, every tenant's wife or widow pays 3 d 
yearly, and every other woman dwelling there 1 d.
What might be the foun- 
dation of this cuftom, or what the reafon of the diverfity, we have not been 
able to conjecture.
And the cuftom itfelf feems to be now vanifhcd and gone.
Within this townfhip of Applethwaite is Calgarth (anciently written Calf- 
garth), a good old houfe and tenement, near the fide of Windermere water ; 
which for a long time was the chief feat of the Philipfons, an ancient family in 
this neighbourhood.
The ancienteft houfe in this county belonging to the Philipfons, fome fay 
was Hollinghall ; others affirm that Thwatterden or Crcok-ha\l was the ancienter 
houfe, though it was afterwards given to a younger brother.
This* family, by a traditionary account, derive their defcent from Philip a 
younger fon of de Iherlwall in Northumberland ; whofe heir, from his father, 
took the name of Philipfon.
The firft in their family pedigree * is, 
I. Robert Philipson of Hollinghall, who married a daughter of one 
Dockwray of Dockwray-hall in Kendal; who, as the pedigree fets forth, lived 
in the reign of king Henry the third.
Which probably is a miftake; for the 
next in the pedigree lived in the reign of king Henry the fixth, and died not 
until the 8 Hen. 8.
So that by this account there muft have been near 200 
years intervening between thefe two perfons.
So indeed it might be, and the

mortem, and other evidences during that period, we have not found the name VI.
of Pbilipfon in this county earlier than the perfon who ftands fecond in the faid 
pedigree in the reign of king Henry the fixth as aforefaid.
Poffibly, Hen. 3.
may have been miftaken for Henry 4.
(as the miftake might eafily be made 
in the numeral letters in old writings) ; and then the difficulty vanifheth.
And we fhall fcarcely find the termination^ at the end of a name much ear- 
lier than that period.
Upon this fuppofuion, this Robert may ftand as father 
to the perfon who next follows in the Philipfon pedigree, viz.

Calgarth-hall is a fair old building.
Its fituation is very pleafant, being

Here was anciently a park: And in the 21 Hen. 6.
the king granted to 
Walter Styrkland efquire the office of keeper of the park of Calgarth for the 
term of his life ; and a like grant was foon after made to Sir Thomas Styrk- 
land knight his fon.
But it hath been long fince difparked.
The large lake called Windermere-water is in this divifion.
The iflands 
within it are all in Windermere parifh.
The rector hath for time immemorial 
had a pleafure-boat upon it; and he hath a prefcription of fo much a boat, in 
lieu of all the tithe fifh that are caught in the lake.
This lake is from one to two miles broad, and extends with crooked banks 
for the fpace of about 13 miles, but in a ftreight line drawn from one end to 
the other perhaps not above 8 or 9 miles, being in fome places of a wonder- 
ful depth, and of a clear pebbly bottom ; breeding good ftore of fifh, as eels, 
trouts (both common and grey trouts), pikes, bafs or perch, fkellies, and par- 
ticularly char, which is a fifh generally about nine inches long, the rarenefs 
of which fifh occafions many pots of chars to be fent to London and other 
places yearly as prefents.
There are three forts of chars ; firft, the male, be- 
ing large, with a red belly, but the fifh thereof fomewhat white within, having 
a foft roe, and thefe are called milting chars ; fecondly, the female, being 
alfo large, with not fo red a belly, but the fifh thereof very red within, having 
its belly full of hard roes or fpawn, called roneing chars ; thirdly, the female 
being not fo large, nor fo red on the outfide, but the reddeft within, having 
no roes in its belly, and thefe are called gelt chars *.

Sir 
PARISH OF WINDERMERE.
(Applethwaite.) 185 
Sir Daniel Fleming fays, there are no chars to be found fave only in this lake CHAP.
and Coningfton water.
Some other waters (he fays) pretend to have chars in 
them, as Buttermere in Cumberland, and Ullefwater (which is between Weft- 
morland and Cumberland) ; but thefe are generally efleemed by knowing per- 
fons to be only cafe, a kind of fifn fomewhat like unto a char, but not near 
fo valuable, but the owners of the fifhery in Ullefwater do not affent to this 
pofkion.
The fifhery in the lake is farmed by feveral perfons, who all together pay to 
the king's receiver for fifhing 61 a year, or for the fifhing and ferry together 
61 13s $d.
And fo it defcends to their executors or adminiftrators.
The fifhing is divided into three cables, as they call them : 1.
The high 
cable, from the water head to the char bed, half a mile above Calgarth.
2. The 
middle cable, from thence to below the ferry.
3. The low cable, fron thence 
to Newby.
And in each cable there are four fifheries.
Out of this lake there yearly pafs up the river Routhey many very large 
trouts, and up the river Brathey great ftore of cafe (which are like the char, 
but fpawn at another feafon of the year).
And although thefe tv/o rivers do 
run a good way together in one channel before they difembogue into Win- 
dermere water, and are both very clear and bottomed alike, yet fcarceever any 
trouts are found in Brathey, or cafe in Rowthey.
Some few falmon alfo, at the 
fpawning feafon, come from the fea through the lake and up the river Rowthey, 
but none ever up Brathey.
Water fowl in great plenty refort to this lake, efpecially in winter ; fuch as 
wild fwans, wild geefe, duck, mallard, teal, widgeons, didappers, gravyes 
(which are larger than ducks, and build in hollow trees), and many others.
In this lake are feveral iflands -, the largeft of which is now called Long- 
holme, but anciently it was called JVynandermere ijland.
Amongft the Efcheats in the 21 Kd. 3.
there is an order, that the wood in 
the ijland of V/ynandermere called Brendwood (that is, fire-wood, from the Saxon 
brenne^ to burn) fhall not be feveral, but common to all the free tenants of 
Kirkby in Kendale, and of Stirkland, Crofthwaite, Croke, and others, as well 
to departure with all their cattle, as to take houfebote and hey bote, at their 
will, without the view of the forefters.
Unto whom this ifland was firft granted in fee by the crown, we have not 
found.
It belonged in after times to the Philipfons of Crooke ; and was fold 
by Frances daughter and fole heir of Sir Chrijlopher Philipfon aforefaid fon of 
Huddlefion Philipfon to Mr. Thomas Brathwaite of Crooke, who fold the fame 
to one Mr. Floyer, who fold to Mr. Thomas Barlow, whofe brother and heir 
Mr. Robert Barlow fold the fame to the prefent owner Thomas Englifi efquire.
This ifland contains about 30 acres of ground, moft of it arable â€¢, and had 
an handfome neat houfe in the middle of it called the Holme-houfe; which 
in the civil wars was befieged by colonel Briggs.for eight or ten days, until 
the fiege of Carlifle being railed, Mr. Huddlefton Philipion of Crooke to whom 
it belonged, hafiened from Carlifle and relieved his brother Robert in Holrne- 
houfe.
7'he next day, being Sunday, Mr. Robert Philipfon, with three or

But not finding him, Robert was unhorfed by

vaulted into the faddle, killed a fentinel, and galloped away, and returned to 
the ifland by two o'clock.
Upon the occafion of this and other like adven- 
tures, he obtained the appellation aforefaidof Robin the Devil.
He was killed 
at laft in the Jrifh wars, at the battle of Wafhford.
Upon this ifland there is a remarkable echo ; and for hearing the fame in 
perfection, Mr. Barlow provided two fmall cannon, on the explofion whereof 
towards the rock on the weft fide of the water, there is firft a burft of the 
found upon the rock exactly fimilar to the firft explofion by lightning, then 
after an intermiffion of about three feconds a fudden rattling of thunder to the 
left.
And after another intermiffion, when one imagines all to be over, a fud- 
den rumbling to the right, which paffes along the rock and dies away not dif- 
tinguifhable from diftant thunder.
St. Mary Holme, otherwife called Lady Holme, is another ifland in this lake, 
fo denominated from a chapel built anciently therein, and dedicated to the 
bieffed virgin.
By the inquifition aforefaid after the death of Joan de Coupland, the jurors 
find, that fhe died feifed of the advowfon of the chapel of St. Mary Holme with- 
in Wynandermere, which was valued at nothing, becaufe the land that had 
belonged to the fame had of old time been feifed into the lord's hand, and laid 
wirhin the park of Calvgarth.
Amongft the returns made by the commiffioners to inquire of colleges, 
chapel?, free chantries, and the like, in the reigns of king Henry the eighth 
and Edward the fixth, there is the " Free chapel of Holme and Winander- 
mere." 
This ifland belonged to the Philipfons of Calgarth, and ftill goes along with 
the Calgarth eftate.
There are no ruins of the chapel remaining.
It is a very 
fmall ifland.
The chapel would cover near half of it.
It is a rock, with fome 
few fhrubs growing upon it, in the middle of the lake, wonderfully adapted 
to contemplation and retirement.
There is another ifland, anciently called Roger Holme, which is of the Lum- 
ky fee-, whereof William de Thweng died feifed in the 14 Ed. 3.
It was 
granted by king Henry the eighth, with the reft of the Lumley fee, to Alan 
Jiellingham efquire ; and now belongs (with the other Bellingham eftates in 
Weftmorland) to the prefent earl of Suffolk and Berkshire.
About the year 1634, there were 47 perfons drowned in this lake in paffing 
the ferry, coming homewards from Hawklhead market, on a ftorm arifing.

TROUTBECK.
Troutbeck is bounded on the Eaft by Kentmere, on the South by the 
mother church divifion, on the Weft by Amblefide, and on the North by 
Patterdale in the parifh of Barton.
It receives its name from the rivulet, which fprings in the head of the dale, 
and running along the caft fide of this divifion, empties itfelf below Calgarth 
in Windermere water.
It is of the Richmond fee ; and on the furvey made as aforefaid of the 
Queen's lands in the 28 Cha. 2.
there appeared to be 48 tenements, of the 
yearly rent of 27/ os 10 d.
There was here an ancient park, which was difparked and divided amongft 
the tenants.
At which apportionment, they who had lands without wood 
were to have a (hare (though in other men's allotment) where wood grew.
Hence it is, that fome tenants have daks of wood in other men's grounds *.
The new park was granted by king Charles the firft to Mr. Huddlefton Phi- 
lipfon aforefaid, for his good fervice in the civil wars.
And the fame was af- 
terwards confirmed by king Charles the fecond to Chriftopher Philipfon fon of 
the faid Huddlefton, afterwards Sir Chriftopher.
In Troutbeck there is a chapel, which was confecrated by bifhop Downham 
in the year 1562, by the name of Jefus Chapel, for the ufe of the inhabitants 
of Troutbeck and Applethwaite : With a laving (as is ufual in like cafes) of 
the rights of the mother church of St. Martin in Winandermere.
There was an ancient falary raifed by the inhabitants at fo much an houfe, 
which at prefent amounts to 4/ 12s %d\ the reft was paid out of a chapel 
ftock, that is, a fund raifed gradually by donations of the inhabitants or others, 
the produce of which was generally applied to the ufe of a fchoolmafter who 
fhould teach their children, and read prayers to them on Sundays.
Out of this ftock a fchool-houfe was erected, nigh unto the chapel.
And 
by licence of the bifhop in 1639, 5/ a year of the produce of this ftock was 
fettled on the fchool, to be enjoyed by the curate, if he fhould chufe to teach 
according to the canon â€¢, or if he fhall refufe, then to be given to whom the 
parfon and churchwardens fhall nominate and the bifhop approve.
Out of the 
aforefaid ftock, 3/ 12s 6d yearly is now given to the curate; and 7/ js 6d 
to a fchoolmafter.
In the year 1747, an allotment of 200/ of queen Anne's bounty fell to 
this chapel-, and in 1756, another allotment of 200/: with which fum of 
400 / ao eftate was purchafed in Dent, of the prefent clear yearly value of 13 /.
And in 1773, the countefs dowager Gower gave 200/, and the governors of 
the faid bounty other 200/, wherewith an eftate was purchafed at Marthwaite 
Foot in the parifh of Sedbergh, of the prefent yearly value of 14/.

There is an hill in this townfhip called G allow How ; which feems to argue, 
VI * that anciently the fleward of the manor under the crown exercifed a jurifdiftion 
" over capital offences.
At a place called Spying Flow in this conftablewick, there was an heap of 
flones called the Raife, which the inhabitants took away to make their fences 
withal, and found therein a cheft of four (tones, one on each fide, and one at 
each end, full of dead men's bones.

AMBLESIDE.
Ambleside, from the fimilitude of the name, is fuppofed by Camden to 
have been the Amboglana in the Itinerary.
But anciently it was written Ha- 
melfide, which hath not fo much refemblance of the word Amboglana, but may 
feem rather to have been derived from the name of the owner.
And Mr.
Horfley makes it appear clearly, that the Amboglana of the Romans was Bur- 
dofwald in Northumberland.
That there has been a Roman ftation here there 
is no doubt ; and Mr. Horfley, from the diflances, fuppofes it to be the Diftis in 
the Notitia.
Sir Daniel Fleming, fpeaking of it, fays ; at the upper corner of 
Windermere water, not far from the prefent town of Amblefi.de, lies the car- 
cafe (as it were) of an ancient city, with large ruins of walls â€¢, and without 
the walls, the rubbifh of old buildings in many places.
Adjoining to which, 
and opening to the water, there hath been a fort, the dimenfions whereof are 
yet very diftinguifnable, being of an oblong figure, in length about 165 yards, 
and in breadth ico.
It hath been fortified with a ditch and rampire.
That 
it was a work of the Romans, the Britifh bricks, the mortar tempered withfrnall 
pieces of bricks, the little urns, the glafs vials, the Roman coins which have 
been often found there, the round flones like millftones (of which foldered 
together they were wont to make pillars);, and the paved ways leading to it, are 
undeniable teftimonies.
â€” And to this place Mr. Horfley fuppofes the military 
ways to have gone, which pafs by Pap-caftle, and through Grayftock park.
Amblefide is all within the manor of Windermere, but only part of it within 
the parifh.
It is of the Richmond fee ; and on the afore faid furvey in the 
28 Cha. 2.
it was found, that there were 43 tenements, yearly rent of 26/ 
17s od.
At Amblefide there is a fmall market, which is kept in that part which is in 
Windermere parifh â€¢, the boundary being at a place called the Stock.
All be- 
low the Stock is in the parifh of Windermere ; above the Stock, in the parifh 
of Grefmere.
In the year 1650, the keepers of the liberty of Fngland by authority of 
parliament, fetting forth a writ of ad quod damnum iffued, and an inquifuiou

and return made thereupon by Anne lady Clifford, countefs of Dorfet, Pem- 
broke, and Montgomery, fheriffefs of the county of Weftmorland, do grant, 
that within the vill of Amblefide in the county aforefaid, there (hall be a mar- 
ket weekly on Wednefday, and two fairs yearly, on Wednefday in Whitfun- 
week, and the 18th of October, with a court of pie-powder and other incidents 
thereunto.
And in the year 1688, July 25, king James the fecond granted to Bra- 
thwaite Otway efquire, Francis Topham efquire, Reginald Brathwaite, George 
Mackerath, Thomas Mackerath, George Dixon, Matthew Mackerath, Wil- 
liam Fifher, and George Kelfick, their heirs and affigns, a market weekly at 
the vill of Amblefide, at the place called the Stock, on Wednefday ; and two 
fairs yearly, one on the Wednefday next after Whitfunday and the day next 
following, the other upon St. Luke's day and the day next following, unlefs 
St. Luke's day be Sunday, then to be on Monday and the day next follow- 
ing; and a fair every fortnight on Wednefday, from the Whitfuntide fair to 
St. Luke's fair ; with a court of pie-powder, to be holden before their fteward ; 
with reafonable toll, tallage, piccage, fines, amercements, and other profits 
to the fame appertaining, to the aife and behoof of the poor inhabitants of 
the town of Amblefide.
In that part which is in Grefmere parifh, ftands the chapel^ endowed by the 
inhabitants, and made parochial by bifhop Pearfon in 1675.
The ancient fa- 
lary was about 1 4 / a year (which is now reduced to 1 2 / 4 s lid) which the in- 
habitants voluntarily charged upon their eflates, by proper deeds for that pur- 
pofe â€¢, which the faid bifhop ordered to be lodged in the hands of fuch perfon 
and at fuch place, as that the inhabitants and other perfons concerned may come 
at the fame when required.
In 1726, 200/ of queen Anne's bounty fell to this chapel by lot.
And in 
1746, Dr. Stratford's executors gave 100/, Sir William Fleming baronet 30/, 
unto which was added 40/ 10 s chapel flock, and 29/ 10s given by Ifaac Knipe 
M. A.
the prefent curate; wherewith another fum of 200/ was procured from 
the governors of the faid bounty.
With which whole fum of 600/, an eftate 
was purchafed in Grayrigg, of the prefent yearly value of 26/.
The curate, Mr. Machel fays, is recommended by the majority of perfons 
paying the faid falary, and approved by the rector.
But Sir Daniel Fleming, 
who was patron of the church of Grefmere, fays, the curates of this chapel 
have been nominated by the patrons of the advowfon of Grefmere, in which 
parifh it is feated.
The truth is, thefe chapels originally by law were in the 
patronage of the incumbent of the mother church, unlefs it was otherwife or- 
dered at the foundation and confecration thereof.
By the decreafe in the value 
of money, the revenues became fo inconfiderable, that the incumbents of the 
mother churches could not procure, or confented that the inhabitants might 
procure, perfons able to officiate â€¢, until at length the inhabitants obtained a 
cuftom againft them-, which cuftom, in the eye of the law, having been for 
time immemorial, is valid and effectual.
In the prefent cafe, the patrons of 
the mother church, by acquiefcence of their prefentees the rectors, feem to 
have obtained the like cuftom.

In the year 1723, John Kelfick of Amblefide gentleman devifed to John 
Mackereth yeoman, George Cumpftone yeoman, and Tomas Knott clerk, 
all of Amblefide aforefaid, and to the furvivors and furvivor of them, their 
heirs and afligns for ever, all his lands at Amblefide, in truft, to fell part thereof 
for payment of debts and legacies, and to let the reft to farm, and with the 
profits and rents of the fame to build a fchool-houfe as near the chapel in 
Amblefide as conveniently may be, and afterwards to pay the rents and profits 
to a fchoolmafter to be chofen by them the faid truftees, and the furvivors and 
furvivor of them, their heirs or afligns, and the feoffees of the chapel falary 
for the time being, and their fucceflbrs or the major part of them.
â€” The faid 
lands produce to the fchoolmafter at prefent about 40/ a year.
In Amblefide is the ancient houfe belonging to the family of the Brathwaites 
in this country, who poflibly might have received their name from fome 
thwaite or woody ground nigh the river Brathey.
There was a very ancient family of this name in Yorkfhire â€¢, but it doth not 
appear that thefe Brathwaites had, or claimed, any connexion with them.
The 
firft in their pedigree is, 
I. Richard Brathwaite of Amblefide; who married Anne daughter of 
William Sandys of Eaft-thwaite in the county of Lancafter, and had ifiue, 
II.
Robert Brathwaite of Amblefide; who married Alice daughter of 
John Williamfon of Under-Skiddow in Cumberland.
He purchafed the manor 
of Burnejhead, which he gave to his eldeft fon Thomas, afterwards Sir Tho- 
mas-, unto which place the faid Sir Thomas removed, and was founder of the 
families of that name both at Burmjhead and Warccf.
Amblefide he referved 
to his fecond fon, viz.
III.
James Brathwaite of Amblefide-, who married Joyce daughter of 
Bernard Benfon of Loughrigg, and by her had ifilie two fons, Thomas and 
Gawen, and three daughters, Dorothy, Ifabel, and Anne, the fecond of which 
daughters was married to Daniel Fleming of Skirwith efquire.
IV.
Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide, fon and heir of James.
This 
Thomas in the laft year of queen Elizabeth obtained a grant and confirmation 
of arms by William Segar, Norroy king of arms on the north of Trent ; fet- 
ting forth, *' That whereas Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide, fon of James, 
" fon of Robert of the fame place, who bore for their ancient feals of arms 
" (to very many old deeds before him the faid Norroy produced) a horn 
" within an efcutcheon, having infcriptions of their name thereabout, and not 
*' knowing certainly what colour the faid horn or fhield fhould be, had re- 
" quefted him the laid Norroy as well to blazon and fet forth the fame in co- 
*' lours, as to appoint him acreft; therefore he the faid Norroy grants to him 
*' for his coat of arms, Or, a horn Sable, with a banderick of the fame : And 
** for his creft, on a wreath of his colours a greyhound jacent Argent, collared 
v Sable, ftudded Or." 
It is remarkable, that this coat of arms is the fame with that of the Bra- 
thwaites in Yorkfhire, which may feem to argue that the horn upon the feal 
came from that family, though thefe Weftmorland Brathwaites at that time 
were

(Ambieside.) I9i 
were not aware of it.
And Sir Thomas Brathwaite of Warcop, great uncle to C H A P.
this Thomas, twenty years before this, had a grant and confirmation of other VI - 
arms, which the Brathwaites both of Warcop and Burnefhead always bore, and 
which the faid grant fets forth to be the ancient arms of their family, viz.
Gules, on a cheveron Argent, three crofs crofslets fitchee Sable.
It hath not appeared, whether this Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide was 
ever married : However, he died without iffue, and was fucceeded by his 
brother, 
V. Gawen Brathwaite of Amblefide-, who married Elizabeth daughter 
of Sir John Penruddock of Halej and by her had iffue, i.
Thomas, 2.
James.
3. John, who married Elizabeth Hudfon, and by her had a daughter and heir 
Elizabeth married to Sir John Otway of Ingmire-hall knight.
4. Robert, 
who married Bridget daughter of Henry Fletcher of Morefby in Cumberland, 
and by her had a daughter.
5. William, who married Elianor daughter of 
Edwin Nicolfon, and had iffue Dorothy.
6. Dorothy, married to Samuel Sands 
of Eaft-thwaite, and had iffue five fons and four daughters.
7. Francis.
8. George.

This Gawerfs will bears date in 1653, and by it we may perceive what was 
then the family eftate.
He therein devifeth his lands at Brimham Park, Revy-

of York ; his lands at Amblefide, Clapperfgate, Grefmere, and Langdale, id 
Weftmorland ; at Lancafter, Brathey, Freermofs, and Parkamoor, in Lanca- 
fhire â€¢, and a tenement and forge at Hockbert, and a finery hearth and forge 
at Confey.
He mentions lands that he had purchafed for his lbn Robert at 
Hugill and Bayfebrowne.
He gives therein 10/ to the chapel ftock of Amble- 
fide.
Five pounds to be put forward fo as the ufe of it yearly may go to the 
opening and cleanfing the watercourfes in the highway, especially in Amblefide 
town ftreet.
And he orders the bridge which he built at the Pull, to be re- 
paired for ever by the owners of his tenements at Pullbeck and Brathey ** 
VI.
Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide, fon and heir of Gawen, mar- 
ried Margaret daughter of Piers Leigh of Lime.
He had no child.
His 
brother James alfo died without iffue.
His brother John died leaving a daugh- 
ter Elizabeth as aforefaid, unto whom the inheritance defcended : She was 
married to Sir John Otway, and to him had iffue a fon Brathwaite Otway efquire, 
and three daughters.
This Thomas, in the year 1670, conveyed by deed to his fitter Dorothy 
Sands, his lands at Amblefide above the ftock late purchafed of Edward Fo- 
reft, alfo a pafture ground called Scandal-clofe, and divers parcels late pur- 
chafed of Hugh Jackfon ; upon truft, if Brathwaite Otway of Ingmire efquire 
pay to her 300/, then fhe to convey to him ; which if fhe fhould refufe, then

t Vl - cember yearly : 100/ thereof to go in temporary charities : and the remaining 
150/ to the ufes of his will.
In the year following, viz.
in 167 1, he conveyed to his faid fitter certain 
other parts of his eflate at Ambleiide, in truft, that if the faid Brathwaite 
Otway fhould pay to her 1000/, then (he to convey the fame to him ; if he 
mould refufe to pay the fame, then the faid lands to be fold to raife the faid 
fum of 1000/, to be applied to the ufes of his laft will and teflament.
And by his will bearing date in the year 1674, he devileth his lands at Low 
Wray in Furnefs Fells, and at Pulbeck and Brathey in the bailiwick of Hawkf- 
head, to his brother Robert, in truft, that if his niece the lady Elizabeth Ot- 
way pay to the faid Robert 700/, then Robert to convey to her ; if not, then 
the faid lands to go to Robert and his heirs charged with the faid 700/; of 
which, 250/ to go towards the maintenance of two fcholars at St. John's col- 
lege in Cambridge, going from the fchools of Kendal and Hawkfhead, and 
for want of fuch, then to any others going out of either of the faid counties.
â€” 
Amongfl other bequefts in the faid will, he gives to the chapel flock of Amble- 
fide 10/, and other 10/ for buying two filver chalices; and 10/ to the mayor 
and aldermen of Kendal to be laid out for a piece of plate for the ufe of their 
corporation *.
The lady Otway and her fon Brathwaite Otway efquire refufed to pay the 
aforefaid feveral fums, amounting in the whole to 2000/; infilling upon a 
marriage fettlement, whereby the faid Thomas Brathwaite covenanted that the 
lands mould defcend to the faid lady Otway, chargeable with 500 /and no 
more.
The matter was brought into the court of Chancery, and the allega- 
tion on the other hand was, the infufBciency of the fuppofed fettlement in 
point of form, and particularly as it was only by deed-poll.
But by the court 
it was decreed, in the 31 Cha. 2.
that the faid agreement, though by deed- 
poll only, fhould bind the lands ; and the heir at law recovered the fame charge- 
able only with 500/-}-.
â€” The confequence of which would be, that the firft 
charge of 300/ by the deed in 1670 would be good ; and the lands being fold 
to raife that fum, it was decreed on a commifilon of charitable ufes at Kendal, 
Feb. 8, 1679, that the lands fhould fland chargeable with the fame in the 
hands of the vendee, being a purchafer with notice j\ The fecond charge 
of 1000/, by the deed in 1671, would be good only as to 200/ thereof, to the 
ufes of the will.
And the charge of 700/ upon the lands in the will would be 
alfo void.
During the courfe of this contefl, the ftatute of frauds and perjuries was 
made (in the 29 Cha. 2.) in order to a more perfect declaration what contracts 
of the like kind fhould be valid, and what not : and it is faid, that the cir- 
cumllances of this particular cafe gave rife to that act.
Thomas Brathwaite fon of James aforefaid made a confiderable collection of

many more unto them ; and after his death, the fame coming to this laft Tho- 
mas of whom we have been now fpeaking, he increafed the fame to the num- 
ber of 322, and gave them in the year 1674 to the univerfity of Oxford; 
being 6 of gold, 66 of filver, and 250 of brafs and copper ; moft of them be- 
ing coins of the Roman emperors.
In the year 1658, Feb. 25, Robert Jackfon of Kendal, mercer, devifed his 
lands at Amblefide (the feigniory or lord's right whereof, as the will fets forth, 
he had lately purchafed of John Archer efquire) to his eldeft daughter Jane 
and the heirs of her body ; in defect thereof, to his younger daughter Grace 
and the heirs of her body ; remainder to two collateral relations and the heirs 
male of their bodies reflectively ; remainder to his own right heirs.
And out 
of the fame he devifeth 3 / a year to be paid by his heir either lineal or col- 
lateral, to the churchwardens and overfeers of the poor of Amblefide, and 
they to diftribute out of the fame every lord's day at Amblefide chapel \s in 
bread to the poor people of Amblefide, and the remaining 8 s they fhall have 
for their pains.
And if the heirs of the bodies of his two daughters fhall fail, 
then he gives 5 / a year out of the premiffes to a preaching minifter at Amble- 
fide forever.
And he gives 5/ out of his perfonalty towards the repairing of 
the flefh-houfe or weighing -houfe in the market place at Amblefide ; and makes 
his wife executrix.
Grace the younger daughter died without ififue.
Jane the elder was married 
to Lionel Topham efquire.
On a commiffion of charitable ufes at Kcndale in 
the year 1680, Lionel Topham and his wife, and alfo the widow who was ex- 
ecutrix, appeared before the commiffioners ; and Mr. Topham alledged, that 
the lands were cuftomary, commonly called tenantright, and were held of his 
late majefly of bleffed memory king Charles the firft, according to the con- 
firmed cuftom of the manor of Windermere, under the payment of 26 s $d 
yearly finable rent, 8d wood rent, and 8 j briggegraffe rent, with a fine cer- 
tain of 33s 4-d upon the death or alienation of the temnt: And that the 
laid John Archer, who in the time of the late rebellion claimed by purchafe 
under the then ufurpers, and before the making of the will, did under colour 
of the faid title fell the fame to the faid Robert Jackfon.

by the parifh of Betham â€¢, on the Weft, by the chapelry of Witherflack in the 
faid parifh of Betham ; and on the North, by Cartmell Fells, being divided 
therefrom by the river Winder.
About 200 yards north-weft from the church, there is a well which bears 
the name of St. Mary's well ; from whence it hath been conjectured that the 
church was dedicated to that Saint.
It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at 36/ 13^4^.
The advowfon 
whereof belongs to Trinity college in Cambridge.
This church, amongft many others in this county, was granted by Ivo de 
Talebois, firft baron of Kendal after the conqueft, to the abbey of St. Mary's 
York ; and afterwards confirmed to the faid abbey, by the name of the church 
of Everfieim, by Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz Reinfred-f.
And in the year 1459, lt was appropriated to the laid Abbey by William 
Boothe archbifhop of York, referving out of the fruits thereof a competent

After the difTolution of the monafteries, queen Mary in the firft year of her 
reign granted the rectory and advowfon of this church to the faid college, 
with other poflefTions in Weftmorland, in exchange for the church of Wymef-

county of Derby *.
(Except the corn tithes of Crofthwaite, which king Ed- 
ward the fixth in the third year of his reign had granted to John Southcoat 
and Henry Cheverton.) 
The fabric of the church is not ancient; for the old church was burned 
down by accident in the year 1601, whereby all the monuments, feats, bells, 
organ, and other ornaments were utterly deftroyed.
It was foon after rebuilt 
(at the expence of the parishioners), and reftored to its priftine flate â€¢, as ap- 
pears by certificate entered in the parifh book, as follows : " Memorandum,

" and in as good efhte as the fame was before the ruinous decay, to their

Since the laid fire, the bells have been caft at different times.

with a yearly rent-charge of 3/ifruing out of a field in Strickland Ketel called

The feveral manors, or other divifions, in this parifh are as follows : 
I. 
MANOR OF HEVERSHAM.
This manor, or part thereof, in the time of William the Conqueror, be- 
longed (together with many others) to Tofi earl of Northumberland -, and at 
the time of Domefday furvey in that king's reign, in order to a taxation, it 
belonged to Roger of Pcifiou*.
Afterwards it appears to have been in the hands of the barons of Kendal.
For William de Lancajlre the firft of that name, baron of Kendal, gave with 
his daughter Agnes in frank marriage to Alexander de Windefore fon and heir of 
William de Windefore the manors of Heverfham, Grayrigg, and Morland.
"Which Alexander, in the 8 Ed. 1.
obtained a grant of a market and fair at 
Heverfham â€¢, which are now, and all along feem to have been held at Mil- 
thorp : for Milthorp feems originally to have been parcel only of the manor of 
Heverfham.
This Alexander de Windefore had a fon William, who had a fon Alexander, 
who had a fon William, who after the death of Joan de Coupland in the 49 
Ed. 3.
was found by inquifition to have held of the faid Joan, on the day on 
which fhe died, the manors of Heverfham, Grayrigg, and Morland.
This laffc William de Windefcre had ifTue only a daughter Marg ery, married 
to John Ducket of a Lincolnshire family, which firft brought the name and 
family of Ducket into Weftmorland, which continued at Grayrigg for many 
generations ; but the manor of Heverfham did not go to the Duckets, or did 
not continue long in their pofTeflion ; for it appears afterwards, or a great part 
thereof, to have belonged to the abbey of St. Mary's York.
The Strick- 
lands alfo of Sizergh had fome lands here ; for in the 35 Ed. 1.
Walter de 
Stirkland obtained a grant of free warren in his lands in Heverfliam, Hel- 
fington, and Barton.
After the difiblution of the monafleries, king Philip and queen Mary, in 
the 4th and 5th years of their reign, granted the manor of Everfham to Ed-- 
mund Moyfes, Richard Fojler, and Richard Bowfkell ; and BotvJkelPs fhare, by

an inquifition in the 13 Eliz.
is thus defcribed j viz.
Richard Bowjkell held of 
the queen in capite one capital mefiliage of the manor of Everfham, with 6 
cottages, 72 acres of land, and all the works of the tenants of the laid manor 
called bond days, if any there be of right accuftomed to the faid capital mef- 
fuage appertaining.
Which faid capital meffuage and other the premises were 
afllgned to the faid Richard BowJIcell and his heirs, in full recompence of the 
whole part and portion which he or his heirs might claim of the faid manor of 
Everfham by the reieafe of Edmund Moyfes and Richard Fofter.
And the jurors 
further find, that the faid Richard Fojier releafed to the faid Edmund Moyfes 
all his right in the refidue of the faid manor : And that the faid Edmund Moyfes 
fold the whole refidue of the faid manor to the faid Richard Bowjkell ; except 
one tenement fold by them the faid Edmund Moyfes and Richard Fofter in Rowel 
to Gabriel Croft, another in Leeigill fold by them to Thomas Smith, one in 
Woodhoufe to John Prefton efquire, one in Aughtinwhaite to Walter Strickland 
efquire, one in Milnethorp then in the tenure of Thomas Mcyfes brother of the 
faid Edmund, and one in Rowel late in the tenure of Edmund Mocre; and alfb 
feveral other tenements granted feverally to William Wilfon, Chriftopher Holme, 
John Jackfon, Henry Holme, John Holme, John Atktnfon, Thomas Holme, Chrifto- 
pher Wilfon, Walter Parle, Robert Wilfon, and William Benfon, parcel of the 
premiffes in Everfham, Milnethorp, Aughtinwhaite, Rowel, and Woodhoufe.
This is that Richard Bufkel whofe arms are put up in one of the church win- 
dows above mentioned.
He was fecond fon of Bufk ell of Milnhoufe in the parifh 
of Kirkby Lonfdale \ and, by his wife Catherine Bindlofs, had iffue Thomas, 
Robert, and James, and four daughters, one of whom was married to Rigg of 
Strickland.
By indenture tripartite, Aug. 8.

Heverfham gentleman of the firft part, Jafper Cholmlay of Highgate in Mid- 
dlefex efquire of the fecond part, and Thomas Bufkell of Gray's Inn fon and heir 
apparent of the faid Richard of the third part, he the faid Richard Bufkell, in 
consideration of a marriage to be had between the faid Thomas Bufkell and 
Frances one of the daughters of the faid Jafper Cholmlay, fettles the manor of 
Heverfham on the iffue of that marriage *.

And we find feveral parts of the manor of Heverfham 
at large (including Milnthorp, Aughtinwhake, Rowel, and Woodhoufe) to 
have been in other hands.
In the 25 Eliz.
Sir Thomas Cecil knight (probably one of the purchafers 
from the crown) and Dorothy his wife conveyed by fine to Thomas Bradley 
efqulre the manor of Everfham and Milnethorpe, with 100 meffuages, 20

Robert Gibfon of Atkenthwaite, by his will in 1701, gave 40 s yearly out

The name of Milthorp fhews the antiquity of a mill there.
In Mr. Ma- 
chel's time, about 80 years ago, there was a paper mill a little above the 
bridge ; and before that, at the fame place was an iron forge.
There are now 
two paper-mills at this place.

on Friday, and a fair yearly on Old May-day.

HINCASTRE.
Within this parifh is the village of Hincastre, called in Domefday-book 
Hennecajtre ; which name feems to import that a caftle hath been anciently 
there; for bene fignifies old, and cajire a caftle.
But as there is no tradition, 
nor any remains or appearance of there ever having been a caftle at this place, 
perhaps it may have received its denomination from fome ancient camp there 
(which the word cajire doth alfo denote).
King Richard the firft granted to Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred and 
his heirs, one carucate of land in Henecajire, to hold of the king by knights 
fervice.
In the reign of king Edward the firft, there was one Adam de Henecaftre, 
who had a daughter Avicia married to Sir Thomas de Hellebeck, and brought 
with her divers lands into the Helbeck family.
She feems to have been an

LEVINS.
Levins, in Domefday Lefuenes, at the time of the conqueft or foon after 
was part of the pofTeilions of Tojli earl of Northumberland ; and, at the time 
of Domefday furvey, belonged to Roger of Poiclou.
In the reign of king Henry 
the fecond, we find the fame in the pofTeflion of Ketel fon of Uchtred, which 
Uchtred poflibly might be defcended from the faid Roger.
This Ucbtred had 
large pofieffions in this part of the county.
That which was afterwards called 
Prejlon Richard, was at this time called Prefton Uchtred.
Ketel fon of this 
Uchtred, in the 34 Hen. 2.
fold a moiety of Levins to Henry fon of Norman de 
Redeman, as appears from a fine palled in that year *.
And from that time Levins hath continued divided, the one part called Up- 
per or Over Levins, the other part Under or Nether Levins.
We will begin with

This being granted as aforefaid to Henry fon of Norman de Redeman, the 
name and family of Redeman continued there for many generations, and had 
large poffeffions as well at Levins as in other parts of the county.
The Redemans that we meet with, were probably not all of Levins : But this

a fon Richard, who had a fon William who died without iffue, whofe heir was 
Edward his younger brother then of the age of 27 years.
This Edward appears to have been living in the reign of Hen. 7.
For in the 
4th year of that king, after the attainder of the Harringtons, the inquifition 
finds, that Thomas Harrington held a mefluage and tenement in Lupton of 
Edward Redman efquire.
And this is the laft of the name of Redman that we 
have met with at Levins.
And the eftate appears to have been fold about this 
time.
The arms of Redman were â€¢, Gules, 3 cufhions Ermine, taffelled Or.
. At this time there was a flourishing family of the name of Bellingham at 
Burnefhead.
Of a younger branch of which family, one Alan Bellingham 
efquire purchafed Levins, of one Redman by name, who then lived at Thorn- 
ton, nigh Eglelton in Yorkflrre.
Which family therefore of Bellingham of 
Levins we proceed next to deduce.
1. Alan Bellingham the purchafer was eighth fon of Sir Robert Bellingham 
of Burnefhead knight; fon of Richard; fon of Robert; fon of Richard, who 
married the heirefs of Burnefhead, and thereby came to that inheritance ; fon 
of William de Bellingham of Bellingham in Northumberland, who was under- 
fheriff in that county in the beginning of the reign of king Edward the firft.
This Alan purchafed not only Levins, but alfo Helfington (where the family 
frequently refided), Gaythom, and Fawcet foreft, and divers lordfhips in Lan- 
cafhire and Northumberland.
And finally he had a grant from king Henry 
the eighth, in the laft year of his reign, of the fourth part of the barony of 
Kendal, which is called the Lumley Fee.
He was treafurer of Berwick, and deputy warden of the marches.
Of him this rhyme was made, alluding to his focialÂ» and at the fame time 
martial difpofition :

He married Elizabeth daughter of William Gilpin of Kentmere â€¢, and by 
her had iflue, 
2. Thomas Bellingham of Helfington efquire, who married Marian 
daughter of Thomas Beck of the barony of Kendal.
This Thomas was dead before the 3 Ed. 6.
for in that year Marian Bel- 
lingham of Helfington widow had a leafe granted to her of the rectory of Gref- 
mere for 97 years, which came to her fon Alan afterwards as executor to her, 
who fold his term and interefl therein to William Fleming of Rydal efquire in 
the 16 Eliz.
This Alan, during his mother's life, lived at Foreft-hall, and 
after her death removed to Helfington.
Befides this fon Alan, who was the elder, there was another fon Thomas, 
who lived at Gaythom, and married a daughter of Thomas Blenkinfop of

He confumed a vaft eftate, and

The river Kent runs 
through the middle of it, over which there is a fair (lone bridge, and a water-

The falmon come up into the frefh

And the late Mr. John Carnaby, who occupied this fifhery for many 
years, and who was deemed an intelligent man and of great veracity, has been often heard to fay, 
that he had many times marked fry as they went down, and taken them again in the next year full

cataduptf or water-falls in this river-, but the other is not in Kent, but in the 
river Betha nigh Betham.
The water at thefe places falls with a mighty noife, 
which to the neighbouring inhabitants is a prognoftication of the weather.
When that which is north from them founds more loud and clear, they look 
for fair weather ; when that on the fouth fide doth the fame, they expect rain.
The philofophy of which is no more than this-, that the fouth weft winds, 
blowing from the lea, bring the vapours along with them, and generally pro- 
duce rain; confequently, blowing from the north or north- call, they have the 
contrary effect.
On the weft fide of the Force was erected, fome few years ago, by Tho- 
mas Holme efquire and other gentlemen in Kendal, a forge for beating out 
pigs of iron, and other iron work, which employs feveral families, who have 
dwelling- houfes and offices near adjoining.
And at Sedgwick, on the eaft fide of Kent, is lately erected by Mr. John 
Wakefield of Kendal and others a mill for making of gunpowder.
In the park of Levins, on the fouth fide of the river, are the ruins of an 
ancient round building now called Kirkftead, which is faid to have been a 
temple dedicated to Diana ; near whereunto are to be feen the ruins of another 
building, which it is fuppofed belonged to that place.
In the fame park, on the other fide of the river, is a fpring called the drop- 
ping well ; which is of a petrifying quality, and in a fhort lpace of time will 
turn mofs, wood, leaves, and the like, into ftone.
A little below Levins, the river Kent enters upon the Sands, from which 
they are denominated Kent Sands ; and though it is larger than the river Betha, 
yet no veffels can come up.
William de Lancajlre, the firft of that name, granted to the priory of 
Conifhead the fifhery of Levene, with a feyn and boat, from the place where 
Craike falls into Levene, as the faid William ufed to fifh there j referving to 
himfelf liberty to fifh there in perfon, and faving the view of his men which 
they had ufed to have in the faid fifhery f.
river Lune, fay, the produce of the falmon is fix years before it comes to be full grown falmon, 
and they diltinguifh the fame in the following manner; Firft year, pinks; fecond year, fmelts ; 
third year, fprods; fourth year, morts; fifth year, fork tails ; fixth year, falmon.
Whereas the 
Carlifle fifhermen diltinguifh thefe as different fpecies : The pinks and fmelts being their fry or 
young falmon; the fprods and morts they call the frefh water whiting; and the fork tails they 
diltinguifh by the name of gilfe ; and will not allow, that any of thefe three laft forts will ever come 
to be falmon.
However, this is certain, (and the author of this note fpeaks from his own know- 
ledge as an angler,) that in the higher parts of the river Lune, where the falmon ufually refort to 
fpawn, there are in the beginning of the fpting two different fizes of young falmon, the one fome- 
what lefs than two inches in length, and the other commonly between four and five inches.
This 
larger fort goes down in the latter end of April or beginning of May. The fmaller fort remain 
the whole fummer in great abundance, and grow to the fize of four inches or upwards, and make 
much diverfion to the angler.
This brood goes down the next fpring, and leaves the laft autumn 
fpawn remaining as before.

The chapel in Stainton commonly goes by the name of Crofcrake chapel, 
from two farm houfes of the name of Crofcrake, nigh which it ftands.
It was founded and endowed by Anfclm de Furnafs, fon of the iirft Michael

Edward the firft was granted by Sir William de Stirkland knight to the priory

de Burton knights, Mafter Roger de Warwick reftor of Herfam, William de 
Windefhover, Richard de Predion, Thomas de Derlay, Roger de Levins, and 
others *.
After the diflblution of the reiigious houfes, this chapel had gone to de;ay, 
and Mr, Machel defcribes it in his time as an ancient chapel rebuilt ; havino- 
a chimney in the north-weft corner ; the lintel thereof lying about a yard from 
the ground ; and a yard above that, the funnel going out at an hole in the 
wall â€¢, without any bell, or any falary belonging to it, or any fervice per- 
formed.
But it was made ufe of for the purpofe of a fchool.
The chapel having long remained in the fame forry condition, the late 
bifhop of Chefter (Dr. Keene) procured it to be put in the lift of chapek to 
be augmented by the governors of queen Anne's bounty, whereby it became 
intitled to 400/, about the year 1757.
Since that time it hath been again

With the above fums, two eftates were

PRESTON RICHARD.
Preston, of very ancient time, appears to have been divided into two parts, 
long before thofe two parts obtained the names of Prefton Richard and Prefton 
Patrick.
At the Domefday furvey, Tor fin had one part of Prefton, and Roger 
of Foiclou the other.
And even at the time of the diftribution of parifhes,.
they feem to have been feparate â€¢, for Prefton Richard is in the parifh of Hever- 
fham, and Prefton Patrick in the parifh of Burton: And it was ufual that a 
man's whole intire eftate in the neighbourhood fhould belong to one and the 
fame parifh.
Hence we fee that Farleton, which extends almoft quite through 
the parifh of Burton, yet belongs to the parifh of Betham.
There was a long fucceffion of perfons of the name of Richard de Prefton, 
from the reign of king Henry the fecond to the reign of king Edward the 
third, both inclufive ; comprehending the fpace of upwards of 200 years: from

the firft of whom probably this part of Prefton of which we now fpeak re- 
ceived the name of Prefton Richard.
At which time alfo, the other part of 
Prefton belonged to Patrick de Culwen, from whom it feems to have received the 
name of Prefton Patrick.
Before the time of the faid firft Richard de Prefton, this part was called 
Prefton Ughtred; from another owner probably of the name of Ughtred, who 
(as we have fhewn) was in poffeflion of the whole manor of Levins at that 
time â€¢, and, as he fold a moiety of the manor of Levins to Redman, fo it is 
moft likely that he fold this moiety of Prefton to the faid Richard.
After this Richard de Prefton (the firft of the name) we find, in the reign of 
king Henry the third, Richard de Prefton knight, who was witnefs to divers 
grants of lands in Lancafhire by Sir John le Fleming knight; together with Sir 
William de Furnes, William fon of Orme, Matthew de Redeman, Thomas de 
Bethun, Adam fon of Game], and divers others.
He was alfo witnefs to a grant and confirmation of lands in Prefton, Holme, 
and Hutton, by William de Lancaftre the third to Patric fon of Thomas fon or" 
Gofpatric.
In the ii Ed. i.
Richard de Prefton was one of the jurors on the inquifition 
poft mortem of William de Linclefey.
In the 20 Ed. 1.
Sir Richard de Prefton was one of the jurors in a caufe be- 
tween the king and the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, concerning the 
advowfon of the two churches at Appleby.
In the 7 Ed. 2.
Richard de Prefton appears to have held lands at Prefton.
In the 7 Ed. 3.
Richard de Prefton was witnefs to a releafe of lands at Old 
Hutton, by Gilbert de Culv/en to Thomas fon of Patric de Culwen.

Richard de Prefton knight re- 
prefented the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
In the 42 Ed. 3.
Richard de Prefton had a licence to impark 500 acres of 
land.
After this, we come to a family pedigree of the Preftons, which family 
finally fettled at Prefton Patrick, and the name became extinct in daughters 
in the reign of king Charles the fecond.
The firft in the faid pedigree is John 
de Prefton, who feveral times in the reign of king Edward the third repre- 
fented the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
The fecond in the faid pedigree is Richard de Prefton, who in the 14 Ric. 2.
appears to have held the manor of Prefton Richard of Sir William Parr 
knight.
This Sir Richard (according to'the Pennington pedigree) died without iftue 
male, leaving daughters coheirs ; of whom Margaret was married to Alan 
Pennington lord of Moncafter, whereby a moiety of the manor of Prefton 
Richard came to that family in which it ftill continues.
The other moiety 
belonged to the Hudleftons of Hutton John, which was taken from them by 
Oliver Cromwell, whereby it came to the Benfons of Hugill, and by marriage 
of one of the coheirs came back into the Prefton family, whole pedigree is

(3) Frances, married to Robert Duckenfield of 
Duckenfield in Chefhirc.
To his fecond wife he married Anne daughter of 
Sir Thomas Strickland of Sizergh, and by her had iffue, (1) George.
(2) Anne* 
married to Sir George Middleton of Leighton baronet.
(3) Margaret, mar- 
ried to Francis Biddulph of Biddulph in Stafford (hi re.
(4) Elizabeth, married 
firft to John Sayer of Yarm : Secondly, to Nathanael Weft efquire : And 
thirdly, to George Layburne gentleman.
Thomas Prefton of Holker efquire, fon and heir of George, married Katha- 
rine daughter of Sir Gilbert Houghton of Houghton-Tower baronet, and by 
her had iffue, (1) George.
(2) Thomns, who married firft Mary daughter of 
George Dodding efquire, and by her had no iffue; to his fecond wife he mar- 
ried a daughter of Sir Roger Bradfhaigh of Haigh in Lancashire baronet, and 
by her had iffue Katharine married to Sir William Lowther of Mafk baronet.
George Prefton of Holker efquire, fon and heir of Thomas, married Many 
daughter of John Lowther of Lowther efquire ; and had iffue 'Elizabeth, mar- 
ried to Sir Wilfrid Lawfon baronet.
And here ended the name of Prefton of Holker.
The arms of Prefton were; Argent, two bars Gules.
On a canton of the 
fecond, a cinquefoil Or, pierced of the firft.
The Preftons of Holker had a 
crefcent, by way of diftinclion of the younger houfe.
On failure of iffue male, their moiety of the manor was fold to Sir John 
Lowther, from whom ic hath defcended to the prefent owner Sir James Lowther 
baronet.
Part of the Lowther tenants pay annually a free rent of 1 1 / 14J \\\d., 
whole tenements were purchffed to freehold of Sir John Lowther baronet in 
lOytj -, the reft pay a cuftomary and finable rent of 8/4^ 9 d.
â€” And part of 
the Pennington tenants pay a free rent of 1/ 13 s Sd; and a cuftomary and 
finable rent of 23/ qs cjd.
(But in 1772 about one third of them purchafed 
their

their tenements to freehold.) â€” The cultomary lands pay a fine arbitrary, but no 
boons or other like fervices.
Both lords have waif and eftray upon the common, as they come firft to them ; 
or upon the other lands in the manor, as they happen to be in the grounds of 
their refpective tenants.
This whole manor, according to Mr. Machel, is holden of the earl of Derby 
as paramount or chief lord, and formerly paid to him a noble rent yearly.
The Penningtons, he fays, purchafed their moiety free ; but the other half, 
viz.
3 j \d yearly continues to be paid by the Lowther tenants.
The ancient manor- houfe was at the place which is now called Old-Rail, and 
belongs to Edward Johnfon efquire, a gentleman eminent for his love of gar- 
dening and botany, and defervedly efteemed for other accomplifhments of 
more general and public utility.
It was purchafed in the year 1603, by his 
anceftor William Johnfon of Stub gentleman.
Adjoining to Old-Hall and Stub eftates was the ancient deer-park, but it hath \ 
been long ago difparked.
And in the north-eaft part of Prefton Richard is a 
place called Birkrigpark, within which is a place called the Sepulchre, where 
many Quakers have been interred â€¢, but it is now feldom ufed, they having a 
commodious meeting- houfe and burying-place in Prefton Patrick.
At End-Moor in this townfhip, in a place belonging to John Savage gentle- 
man, in digging the foundation of a building fome few years ago, the work^ 
men found a curious hammer-head of ftone, which undoubtedly muft be ex- 
tremely ancient, as it hath in all probability been formed before the ufe of 
iron in this ifland.
It is of the exact form and fize of a fmith's ftriking ham- 
mer.
The worthy vicar of this parifh fent it to Trinity college in Cambridge ; 
and in the year 1770, the learned Mr. Lort, fellow of the faid college, and 
greek profeflbr in that univerfity, exhibited it to the Antiquarian Society.
He 
obferved thereupon, that " a weapon of this fize and (hape is figured in the 
" Mufeum Danicum ; and that in the fame Mufeum there is an account of an 
" urn dug up in Holfatia in 1686, containing afhes, bones, and the head of a 
" fpear made of flint, and another ftone like an hatchet : That the famous old 
'* northern poem, called the Edda, makes frequent mention of the malleus of 
" the god Thor, or god of thunder, which, in the original, is called hammaren 
" miolnar, and, in the latin tranftation, malleus contuf.r, and is particularly ce- 
" lebrated as fatal to enemies, giants, and dsemons." â€” To which may be add- 
ed the fentiments of a learned Frenchman on the fame fubjecT, from the Hif- 
tory of Arts and Sciences in 3 volumes printed at Edinburgh, vol.
i. page 156.
*' A kind of thunder ftones, as they are commonly called, are ftill preferved 
" in a great many cabinets.
They have the fhape of axes, plough-fhares, 
" hammers, mallets, or wedges.
For the moft part they are of a fubftance 
" like our gun-fiints, lb hard that no fiie can make the leaft imprefilon upon 
" them.
They are almoft all pierced with a round hole, in the place moft 
" proper for receiving a handle, and this hole is made in fuch a manner, that 
" the handle being once forced in, will no: come out again, but with great 
" difficulty, as is with our hammers.
It is well known, that tools of ftone 
" have been in ufe in America from time immemorial.
They are found in the

They fhape and fharpen them upon a kind of grindftone ; and, 
" by length of time, labour, and patience, form them into any figure they 
" pleafe ; and ufe them nearly in the fame manner as we do our tools of iron." 
Mr. Robinfon of Newby-bridge in Lancafhire, in draining fome low grounds, 
at a good depth below the furface, met with a ftone hammer-head like this 
above defcribed.
And the late bifhop of Carlide, Dr. Lyttelton, exhibited 
fuch another to the Antiquarian Society, found in the pariih of St. Cuth- 
bert's Carlifle.
Miles Greenwood, a native of Crooklands in this townfhip, by his will in 
1637, gave 20 j yearly iffuing out of an houfe at Grantham in Lincolnshire, 
to be diftributed to the poor people dwelling nigh unto Crooklands.

CROSTHWAITE AND LYTH.
This is a large divifion, confifliing part of the Richmond and Marquis fees, 
and part of the Lumley fee.
By the inquifition aforefaid of the lands belonging to queen Katharine in 
the 28Cha 2.
it was found, that in Crofthwaite and Lyth there were 63 te- 
nements of the Richmond fee, of the yearly cuftomary rent of igl 3s yd.
And two tenements of the Marquis fee, of the rent of 15 s.
â€” Of the Lumley 
fee there are about 50 tenements.
The chapel of Crofthwaite is about five miles north weft from the parifh 
church, It feems to have been of ancient foundation, but was not made pa- 
rochial till the reign of Philip and Mary.
For in the year 1556, Cuthbert 
bifhop of Chefter, reciting the petition of the inhabitants of the vills or ham- 
lets of Crofthwaite and Lyth, fetting forth their great diftance from the parifh 
church, fo that they cannot carry their dead to be buried without great charge 
and inconvenience, nor carry their children to be baptized without great 
danger to the faid children both of foul and body, nor attend the church for 
divine fervice and facraments without great charge and labour, and therefore 
praying that he would vouchfafe to confecrate a certain chapel of theirs com- 
monly called Crofthwaite chapel, and grant licence for a chaplain to officiate 
therein, to be maintained by their own falary and charge, and not otherwife ; 
he the faid bifhop, with the afTent of the matter arid fellows of Trinity college 
in Cambridge, patrons of the pariih church of Heverfham, grants licence, that 
in the chapel or ora.ory aforefaid called Crofthwaite chapel, in honour of the 
blefied virgin Maty, fituate in the hamlet of Crofthwaite aforefaid, mafs mall 
be celebrated, the canonical hours rehearfed, the bodies of the dead buried, 
and the facraments adminiftred, by fit priefts canonically ordained, having firft 
been approved by the vicar of Heverfham for the time being: Yet fo, that no 
prejudice thereby arife to the mother church in tithes, oblations, obventions, 
or other ecclefiaftieal rights.
With a provifo, that this licence once in three 
years be brought by the chaplain or three other principal inhabitants of the faid 
han) lets to the parifh church, and there on the fecond Sunday after Pentecofl be 
read

read at the high alrar after reading the gofpel by the minifter there officiating, 
if by the vicar or churchwardens of, the laid church of Heverfham they be 
thereunto required.
Afterwards, about the year 1580, on fome difputes between the inhabitants 
of the chapelry and the reft of the parifhioners, an award was made.
Which 
award being deftroyed by the burning of the church as aforefaid, a memorial 
thereof was put into writing, and regiftred in trie parifh book as followeth : 
"Whereas ir.
fortuned, through negligence of a carelefs workman, being a 
plumber, in the year 1601, on Wednefday being the firff.
day of July, the 
parifh church of Heverlham was utterly confumed with fire, and all imple- 
ments, ornaments, books, monuments, chefts, organs, bells, and all other 
things were perifbed ; amongft which things, there was an award indented, the 
date whereof we have not in perfect memory, yet we think that it was about 
the year of Chrift 1560, made between the inhabitants of Crofthwaite and 
Lyth, being a hamlet of the faid parifh, on the one part, and the inhabitants 
of the other hamlets of the faid parifh on the other part, awarded by the right 
worfhipful Sir Thomas Boynton knight and Rowland Philipfon efquire, touch- 
ing certain queflions, articles, fuits, and controverfies then depending amongft 
them.
The articles whereof, we whofe names are hereunto fubfenbed thought 
meet and convenient to exprefs and fet down, fo near as our memories do ex- 
tend unto.
Firft, ordered and awarded, that the faid inhabitants of Crofthwaite 
and Lithe, by their churchwardens and fworn men, ihall yearly upon New 
Year's even make their accounts and reckonings at Heverfham church, for 
all matters and receipts for the benefit of the faid church, and yearly pay 
fuch fums of money as Ihall fall due to the church, to 'the then churchwardens 
of Heverlham.
And alfo fhall pay towards the ftipend and wages of the parifh: 
clerk of Heverlham yearly, on New Year's even, the fum of ijs.
And alfo 
fhall pay for every corpfe being buried above the Quire wall at Crofthwaite 
gs \d\ and for every corpfe buried beneath the Quire wall is Sd. Alfo or- 
dered and awarded, that when any afTefTment, cuilibet, or proportion mall be 
laid and impofed for the neceffary repairs of the church of Heverfham, the 
faid inhabitants of Crofthwaite and Lithe Ihall anfwer, bear, and pay a full 
quarter or fourth part of the fame, fo oft as need fhall require.
Alfo ordered 
and awarded, that the faid inhabitants of Crofthwaite and Lithe fhall appoint 
and name two fufficient men within their hamlet, to ferve as churchwardens at 
Heverfham church yearly, and fix others to be fworn men as affiftants, to 
make up the number of 24 fworn men.
And the faid churchwardens and 
fworn men to join with the other churchwardens and fworn men of the faid 
parifh, in all things needful and neceffary for the faid church ; and always to 
be appointed on New Year's even â€¢, and to take their oaths on the fifth day of 
January, being the twelfth even, at the faid church of Heverfham, according 
as hath been accuftomed." â€” The fubftance of which oath is, to maintain and 
fupport the benefit of the mother church.
The chancel and fleeple of this chapel were built by one William Gilpin, 
who alfo contributed largely towards the three bells, in 1626.
On which 
bells, 
Â«i6 PARISH OF HEVERSHAM.
(Crosthwaite and Lyth.) 
bells are the following infcriptions : On the firft bell; Jefus, be our fpeed.
On 
the fecond beil ; Soli Deo gloria.
On the third bell ; 
A young man grave in godlinefs, 
William Gilpin by name, 
Cave fifty pounds, to make thefe founds.
To God's eternal fame.
The curate's revenue confifts of $lSs lod ancient chapel falary, paid by 
the inhabitants; who alio in the year 1716 raifed 200/ by fubfcription, and 
thereby obtained 100/ from the governors of queen Anne's bounty: With 
which an eftate was purchafed in Dent in the county of York, of the prefent 
yearly value of about 17/.
There is alio a fmall cottage belonging to the 
curate of about 40 s a year; and the intereft of 158/ contributed by divers 
benefactors, amounting to 8/ a year.
The whole amounting to about 32 1 per 
annum.
In the year 1756, Agnes widow of William Burns bequeathed by her will 
15/ for a flagon to be ufed at this chapel ; which was accordingly purchafed, 
with her name ingraved thereon.
In 1665, George Cock of Brow-head in Lyth gave by his will 20/ to the 
poor of this chapelry ; the intereft thereof to be diftributed on New Year's 
day yearly: And 10/, whereof the intereft to go to the ufe of a fchoolmafter 
at Crofthwaite ; and when there is no fchoolmafter, then to go towards re- 
pairing the highways in Lyth quarter: And 20/, the intereft whereof to go 
to the curate at Crofthwaite : And 10/, of which the intereft to be applied for 
the repair of the highways in Lyth quarter : Alfo 50/ to his truftees, referring 
it wholly to them to beftow fo much thereof as they pleafe towards building a 
fchool-houfe convenient for the whole hamlet.
In 1671, Janet his widow by 
her will gave 10 / to the poor ftock.
By other like benefactions, they have now a poor ftock of 215/, nnd a fchool 
ftock of 70/.
Befides which, there was the futn of 60/ fchool ftock laid out 
in the purchafe of a cottage and two Imall parcels of land called Elie Parrocks, 
which yielded 3/ a year.
But the tides having warned away great part of the 
land, the inhabitants (with the confent of the lords of the manor) laid part of 
the common to the faid lands to make up the deficiency ; and the cottage alio 
being gone to decay, they repaired the fame with the 10/ highway money, and 
the tenant of the cottage to pay 10s yearly for the repair of the highways in 
Lyth quarter.
In a meadow within this chapelry, belonging to John Robinfon of Water- 
millock efquire, are three pits ; the largeft of which is immenfely deep, and 
commonly faid to be unfathomable.
One thing very remarkable is, that when 
there is much rain on the weft fide of Whitbarrow, in Witherflack or Cart- 
mell Fells, the water in the pits will rife and overflow the meadows.
And, in 
the feafon of lalmon fmelts, thefe pits abound with thofe fmelts, at the fame 
time that they are to be feen in the river Kent ; which argues, that they arrive 
from thence in fubterraneous paflages.
The water from the pits runs under 
Thorpel bridge, and the courfe thereof is called Thorpel Dike.

In this hamlet is a large mofs, known by the name of Lyth-mofs ; where 
feveral large trees, as oak, fir, and birch, are frequently dug up.
One oak 
ws lately taken up, quite found, which contained 2000 feet of wood.
And at a place called High in Crofthwaite, belonging to Mr. Thomas Ro- 
binfon, was a remarkable large beech tree ; whereof one fingle branch, broken 
off by a violent hurricane Oct. 8, 1756, meafured 193 feet.
The remaining 
parr, about two years afterwards, was cut down, which meafured 605 feet.
Befides which, there were four cords and an half of fmall wood.

BEtham feems to have had its name from the river Betha, which runs 
through the village, and fo by Milnthorp into the fea ; as much as to fay, 
the hamlet or village on the river Betha.
This river is now called Bela, by cor- 
ruption as it feemeth â€¢, for in Mr. Machel's account it is invariably written 
Betha, without any intimation of its having any other name.
And Mr.
Leland who travelled through this country in the reign of king Henry the 
eighth, fays, " By By I ham runneth Byth water, a pretty river." And efpe- 
cially, in a grant of lands and other poffeffions to the priory of Conifhead (as 
hereafter mentioned), it is exprefsly called the water of Betha.
Sometimes the name of the place is written Bethom \ in which refpect it 
may be underftood to fignify the holme ground adjoining to the river.
This parifh is bounded on the Eall by the parifh of Burton (indeed it runs 
almoft quite through and interfects the faid parifh of Burton, which part is 
called Farleton) ; on the South, by the parifh of Warton in the county of Lan- 
cafler ; on the Weft, by the fea ; on the North- weft by the parifh of Cartmell 
in the faid county of Lancafter -, and on the North, by the parifh of He- 
verfham.
The church, according to Mr. Machel's account, is dedicated to St. Leoth 
or Lyth) otherwife called Lioba or Liobgytha ; but according to Mr. Brown 
Willis it is dedicated to St. Michael.
It is a vicarage, in the patronage of the

crown, and in the prefentation (under the crown) of the chancellor of the 
duchy of Lancafter.
It is rated in the king's books at i^lys 6d- t and the 
clear yearly value, as it was certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty 
12 / 6 s 8 d.
1-vo de Talebois gave this church and certain lands at Halfrebeck (now called 
Haverbrack) to the abbey of St. Mary's York â€¢, to which abbey this church was 
afterwards appropriated.
And Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz Reinfred and his 
wife Hehvife daughter and heir of William de Lancaftre the fecond confirmed 
the fame to the priory of Wetherall in Cumberland which was a cell of the 
faid abbey *.
And the fame Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz Reinfred gave to St.
Peter's hofpital in York liberty for their hories and fwine to be within his forefb, 
and to have two folds therein, one in Capelthwaite and the other in Roaker- 
dale, for the taking of them * and that one perfon of the faid hofpital, and 
one other perfon, may keep the fame within his foreft, fo as it be done with- 
out any bow, arrows, or dog \.
This church paid a penfion of 405 a year to the faid abbey.
After the diffolution, the rectory of this church continued in the hands of 
the crown till the 9th year of king James the firft (the crown leafing it from 
21 years to 21 years, under the fee farm rent of 25/ a year, the leffee paying 
alfo 13/ a year to the vicar).
Which faid king, in the year aforefaid, granted 
the fame to Sir Francis Ducket of Grayrigg knight, referving the ancient rent 
and payment to the vicar.
From Sir Francis it defcendcd to James Ducket efquire â€¢, who fold the 
great tithes of Farleton to the Wilfons of Underley ; the great tithes of Helflack 
and Storth to Hugh Tomlinfon, who fold the fame again to Mr. Ralph Bufkell : 
Whatfide great tithes he gave to William his eldeft Ion by his fecond wife, who 
fold the fame to John Girlington of Thurland-caftle in Lancafhire efquire.
The refidue of the rectory he fettled in truftees to be fold for raifing por- 
tions for his three daughters which he had by his third wife, who was after- 
wards married to Thomas Hilton efquire, and the overplus to go to their mo- 
ther.
One of thefe daughters, Mariana, died unmarried ; Anne the fecond 
daughter v/as married to one Mr. Gandy â€¢, and the third daughter Elianor was 
married to Mr. Thomas Shepherd, who purchafed the other fillers fhares^ and his 
fon the lare Thomas Shepherd of Kendal efquire fold the fame about the year 
1730 to Daniel Wilfen of Dallam-Tower efquire, grandfather of the prefent 
owner thereof.
The fmall tithes by the faid fettlement came to their mother, in whofe fa- 
mily they continued till after the death of her fon George Hilton.
And in 
the year 1756 the fame were purchafed to the church for the ufe of the vicar, 
for the fum of 120/; of which the late commiffary Stratford gave 40/, and 
the parifh fubfcribed 80/.
The whole crown rent of 25/ a year remains 
upon thefe fmall tithes, and they only produce to the vicar upon an average 
about 4/ 10s a year: But if they fhall happen to fall fliort, fo as to be in- 
fufficient to fatisfy the crown rent, undoubtedly the other tithes before fold off 
will be liable to make it up.

The whole revenue of the vicarage at this day is as follows : Penfion as 
aforefaid referved out of the rectory 13/.
Small Tithes 4/ 10s.
Thrte in- 
clofures at Kellet purchafed by Mrs. Dorothy Wilfon in 1707, 4/ 10s.
In 
1722, Edward Colfton of Mortlake in Surrey efquire gave ioo/, Mr. James 
French of London another 100/, and the reverend Mr. Smith vicar 60/, 
unto which the governors of queen Anne's bounty added 200/, wherewith an 
eftate was purchafed at Prieft Hutton : And in 173 1, Mrs. Elizabeth Palmer 
gave 200/, and the governors of the faid bounty 200/, wherewith an eftate 
was purchafed at Yelland : Which two eftates are worth yearly about 27/.
â€” So 
that the total of the vicar's revenue is about 49/ per annum.
There is no vicarage-houfe, nor glebe-land, not even fo much as the church- 
yard, belonging to the vicar.
Vicars, fince the accefiion of king James the firft, have been as follows : 
Edward Hal/lead died in 161 2, and was fucceeded by Edward Fi/her.
On the death of Edward Fi/her in 1642, George Bennifon fucceeded.
In 1665, George Bennifon refigned, and John Brockbank was instituted.
On his refignation in 1670, William Jack/on was inftituted, who continued 
vicar 39 years.
On the death of William Jack/on in 1709, James Smith was inftituted, and 
continued vicar 43 years.
In 1753, on the death of James Smith, Daniel Wilfon, M.
A. was inftituted.
Upon whofe refignation in 1762, the prefent vicar William Hutton fucceeded, 
unto whom we are obliged for feveral of the particulars relating to this pariih.
This gentleman, by an example worthy of imitation, hath made a large folio 
collection of matters curious and ufeful concerning his faid parifh, and hath 
lodged the fame in the veftry of the church for the information of pofterity, 
defiring that the fame may never be removed from thence upon any account 
whatfoever ; with vacant pages to be filled up from time to time, as materials 
fhall occur.
And this undoubtedly is the proper method to render fuch a 
work compleat ; for it is impofiible in the nature of the thing, for one perfon, 
or during the courfe of one man's life, to collect all things that may be ufeful 
in fuch an undertaking, and time will add many other particulars.
The parfonage or rectory- houfe flood at the north-eaft corner of the church- 
yard, and was formerly called the college of St. Mary's ; and the old vicarage- 
boufe ftood behind it, adjoining to the churchyard wall.
Nigh to the place where the old rectory-houfe ftood, the aforefaid 'Thomas 
Hilton efquire erected a fair-houfe, which was afterwards improved and ren- 
dered more commodious by his fon and heir George Hilton efquire.
Which faid 
George Hilton, being a Roman catholic, joined the rebels in 171 5, and mak- 
ing his efcape was pardoned amongft the reft by the act of grace in the year 
following.
He ever afterwards lived private, and built an houfe at the fouth, 
end of Betham park, unto which he retired.
The reverend Mr. Hutton afore- 
faid takes notice, that fome few years ago there was found in an old cheft a 
journal of his life, which unfortunately hath been fince loft or miflaid.
It ap- 
peared to have been an account of his life taken by himfelf every nighr, or 
ibmetimes at the end of the week.
" On Sunday," fays he in one place, " I 
F f 2 vowed 
220 PARISH OF BETHAM.
" vowed to abftain from three things during the courfe of the enfuing week'* 
[which was in Lent], " viz.
the tile of women, eating flefh, and drinking 
" wine.
But, alas, the frailty of good refolutions !
I broke them all, laid 
" with a girl at the Sandfide, was tempted to eat the wing of a fowl, and 
" got drunk at Milnthorp." 
The three fifters aforefaid of the Ducket family dying one after another, 
and the furniture which was divided amongft them having been fold at dif- 
ferent fales, the goods came into the hands of divers houfekeepers within the 
parifh.
At Hangbridge there is now an ancient picture of one of this family 
which had been drawn on a table or board, and now converted into a clock- 
cafe.
The venerable face of this anceftor is in front, and an infcription partly 
in front and partly on the fide, having been cut through by the faw.
As near 
as it can be made out the infcription is thus : 
Quos fortuna premit, patientia tollit in altum.
Non nifi mentis inops nimbofo turbine cedit.
Sic mea vita fuit : Sed nunc donabitur astas, 
Et placido vento fulcabit squora tuto, 
Sicut acu dempta pannus contexitur inde, 
Sic Ccelefti ardens depellit amorque timorem.
Et velut omiffis multis, nugifque relictis, 
Grandia concurrunt (demptis florentibus annis) 
Sic mea fors repetir, repetet pars optima vita?.
At the bottom appears his age and the year of our lord j viz.
iEtatis 74.
Anno 1597.
The purport of the infcription is, " That having been tofTed in troubles and 
" vanities in his youth, now he is become old he is engaged in greater and 
" more important concerns." 
According to the courfe of chronology, this muft be the picture of Atithcny 
Ducket efquire, grandfather of Sir Francis ; which Anthony had a fon Lionel 
Ducket at that time fellow of Jefus college in Cambridge, who (mod likely) 
accommodated his father with this infcription.
The longevity of this family was remarkable; for during the courfe of 12 
fucceffions, being the whole time that they lived at Grayrigg-hall, not one of 
them (as we oblerved before) was ever in wardfhip, the heir being always of 
the age of 21 or upwards, at the time of the death of his anceftor.
The church is in fair and neat condition, with a tower fteeple and three 
bells.
It ftands in a fine vale (or holme ground), and the fituation is ren- 
dered very pleafant by the variety of wood, water, and rocky cliffs in profpedt.
On a pillar nigh the rails of the communion-table is the following monu- 
mental infcription :

of Daniel Wilfon efquire of Dallam-Tower ; 
who departed this life 
the 31ft of May, A.
D. 1754, aged 74.
He married Elizabeth daughter 
of William Crowle of Hull efquire in Yorkfhire ; 
By whom he had iffue 6 fons and 2 daughters.
He reprefented the county of Weftmorland 
in parliament near 40 years, with the

In private life, 
he was an affectionate hufband, 
an indulgent parent,

and in all ftations of life, 
his conduct was uniform and confident.
His fon Edward Wilfon efquire

MANOR OF BETHAM.
In the parifli of Betham there are three divifions (exclufive of Wither/lack) 
which feem anciently to have been all one manor or lordlhip, to wit, Betham, 
Haverbrack, and Farkton.
They all belonged to the family of Talebois, ba- 
rons of Kendal ; and were holden (except what was given away to religious 
houfes) under the barons of Kendal by one and the fame lord.
And this moft 
probably is the reafon, why the parifli of Burton is interfered as aforefaid by 
Farleton â€¢, for in the diftribution of parifhes, a man's whole eftate or manor 
was commonly annexed to that church where he ufually refided, and of which, 
indeed in many places the lord of the manor was founder and patron.
At the time of the conqueft this was part of the poffeffions of Tojii earl of 
Northumberland^ and at the time of the Domefday furvey belonged to Roger 
of PoitJou, and under him to Eruvin the prieft * -, whole fuccefibrs (as was 
ufnal) took their name from the place.
â€” In the 17th year of king John, the 
heir of Thomas de Bethun (amongft other fons or daughters and heirs of divers 
mefne lords holding under the barons of Kendal) was delivered as an hoftage 
to the faid king, for the future fidelity of Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred 
and of William his fon, who had lided with the rebellious barons.

Rofs of Kendal caftle, to fend their prifoners from their cables to the Tower

In the 49 Ed. 3.
Ralph de Bethame knight held of Joan de Coupland the 
manor of Bethome with the appurtenances, by homage and fealty and the 
fervice of 32 J a year, as of her manor of Kirkby in Kendale.

John de Bethom reprefented the county of Weftmorland in 
parliament.
In the 3 Hen. 5.
a commiffion of array was ifiued and directed to Thomas 
de Betham to mufter and array all the men at arms.
In die 3 Hen. 6.
Thomas de Betham was reprefentative in parliament for 
Weftmorland.
And this is the laft of the Bethams of Betham that we have met with.
In Betham church, on the fouth fide of the communion-table, in that part 
which is repaired by the owner of the manor of Betham, are two effigies of 
ftone raifed near a foot and an half from the floor, which tradition reports to 
be the monuments of the laft Sir Thomas de Betham and his lady.
He is laid 
in a coat of armour, with his fword by his fide.
His lady is in a fhroud, with 
her hands clafped upon her breaft.
On the north fide are the following arms 
quarterly, 1.
A raguled crofs.
2. Six annulets, three, two, and one.
3. 
Three efcalops, two and one.
4. A faltier ingrailed.
The fame tradition goes, that this manor was forfeited in confequence of 
the battle of Bofworth-field, wherein the houfe of York received their final 
overthrow ; and that thereupon it was granted to the Stanleys.
It feemeth 
indeed to have come into that family about that time, perhaps by purchafe 
from the former polTefibr, rather than by any grant from the crown upon at- 
tainder ; for in the other grants to the Stanleys by king Henry the feventh of 
the forfeited eftates of Farleton, Witherflack, and the reft, we have not found 
any mention of the manor of Betham.
And it feemeth that either the above- 
faid monument is not the monument of the laft Thomas de Betham, or that 
he was not attainted â€¢, otherwife it would fcarcely have been permitted that his 
monument lhould be ornamented with his armorial enfigns, nor indeed would 
he have been fuffered to be interred there at all, after having forfeited his 
right of fepuhure in that place, and the property thereof transferred into other 
hands, and thofe alfo of the oppofite and prevailing party.
This manor is of the Richmond Fee-, and by the furvey made in the 28 
Cha. 2.
amongft the free rents then paid to queen Catharine, the earl of Derby 
ftands charged with the annual payment of 2/ 13 j 4*/ for Bethom park.
The hall or manor-houfe at Betham was anciently a large handfome build- 
ing, but is now in ruins.
It is in a delightful fituation, having the profpect 
variegated with woods, water, and champion ground.
It hath been built 
caftle-wife, and by Leland and others is called a caftle.
Like all the other 
Old houfes in the northern parts, it hath been built for defence as well as orna- 
ment.

merit, In all of them there was one large room called the ball, where they 
tranfafled all bufinefs, and according to the laudable practice of bofpitality 
entertained and fealted their friends and dependents ; hence came the proverb, 
'Tis merry in the hall, 
When beards wag all.
College halls, and halls of trading companies, have fome remains of thefe 
ancient cuftoms.
The following is a defcription of the caftle and ruins, as furveyed by the 
prefent worchy vicar aforefaid.
â€” By an eafy afcent from the river, we come to 
a gateway, being the grand entrance into the cattle-yard.
Entering there, we 
find ourfelves in a fine large open are.*, 70 yards long by 44 in breadth.
On 
the right appear to have been fome buildings as low as the walls of the yard to 
the length of 98 feet, like barracks for the foldiers.
On the left we have a 
charming view of the caftle, (landing at the fouth end of the area.
The walls 
of the yard are 3^ foot thick, with loop-holes for the archers, at proper dis- 
tances, They are 12 foot high below the parapet.
The loopholes are about 
3 foot from the ground, 2 foot and an half in height and breadth, floping out- 
ward to 3 inches and an half.
The front of the houfe is in length Sy feet, of 
which the eaft wing is 22, and the weft 26.
The remaining fpace of 39 feet 
makes the hall, which is in breadth 25 feet.
The windows in the hall are high 
up in the wall, and fmall in proportion to the room, with much Gothic work 
about them.
Indeed, in all the old houfes in the country the windows (for 
the fake of defence) have been fmall, and ftrongly fecured with crofs bars of 
iron.
The doors of the rooms are all little, and one above another through 
each ftory.
Up one pair of flairs there hath been a chapel, with a back flair- 
cafe to it, whereby the tenants and neighbours might come to the chapel 
without difturbing the family.
Southward from the caftle, there is a fine de- 
fcent, at the foot of which is a good fpring that fupplies two large ponds with 
water.
Behind the houfe was the park, and in one of the walks there are the remains 
of a lodge, and near it a fpring of good water, which Camden fays had a pe- 
trifying quality, but there is little or no appearance of fuch quality at prefent.
Within this divifion is Capplefide demefne, where anciently was an hall of 
confiderable dimenfions -, containing in front, including the two wings, 117 
feet.
It may feem, from its name, to have belonged to the chapel; for an- 
ciently this word was founded Capel, in like manner as the Latin capella.
This 
demefne belonged to the Preftons, and by marriage of one of the coheirefTes 
came to the Cliffords, and in the year 1 767 was fold by the prefent lord Clif- 
ford to Daniel Wilfon of Dallam Tower efquire for 2560/.
Within this manor alfo is Helflack Tower, now in ruins.
Helflack moffes 
are remarkable for the ant or pifmire : About the middle of Auguft, when 
they take wing, a thoufand feamews may be feen here catching thefe infects : 
The neighbours call them the pifmire fleet.
In thefe moffes are found like- 
wife, as in many others, large trees lying in all directions at five foot depth.

226 PARISH AND MANOR OF BET HAM.
In this divifion likewife is Arnfide Tower, having the walls thereof not yet 
much decayed.
Thefe towers feem to have been erecled to guard the bay ; as 
there are on the oppofke fide the veftiges of Broughton tower, and Bazin 
tower; fo there is Caftle-head upon the ifland in Lindal Pow; and higher up, 
the moffes of Methop, Ulva, and Foulfhaw, were inacceffible.
In the center 
â€¢ of the bay is Peel caftle.
In the river Betha is one of the two catadupa or water-falls mentioned by 
Camden.
The rock which croffes the bed of the river 66 foot in breadth is 
16 feet perpendicular, down which the water falls with a mighty noife.
But 
in the fummer feafon the whole of the river is employed in carrying two corn- 
mills, one on each fide-, one of which mills, belonging to the earl of Derby, 
has two thirds of the water; and the other, belonging to Mr. Wilfon, has one 
third.
In the 7 Ed. 1.
there is a patent for a freefljhery in the water of Methop in 
Weftmorland J.
The fifhery in the river Betha belongs at prefent to the earl of Derby, the 
earl of Suffolk and Berkfhire, and Mr. Wilfon.
The two laft claim from St.
John's crofs upon the fands, up to another crofs of the fame name above Betham 
bridge.
III.
HAVERBRACK.
This divifion, like as the reft, belonged to the barons of Kendal, and feems 
to have been a part only of the ancient manor of Betham.
The church it 
which was given by Ivo de Talebois as aforefaid to the abbey of St. Mary's 
York, ftands in Haverbrack ; and he and his fucceilbrs gave certain lands 
therein to divers religious houfes.
Particularly, Margaret de Rofs gave the 
capital mefiuage and divers demefne lands there to the priory of Conifhead in 
Lancafhire.
And William de Haverbrec gave to the fame priory a mefiuage 
in Haverbrec, with the gardens thereto belonging, and two acres of land ad- 
joining to the fame; alio the land called Blacket Croft, with the melius 
there; which Blacket Croft lies between the water of Betha and the demefne 
of the faid William ; with half an acre of turbary which lies without the ditch, 
and one perch of land between the gate of Betha and the land of the church, 
and feven acres of land with a mefiuage below Bethegate.
Alfo Elias de Gyle 
granted to the canons of the faid place, all his lands at Haverbrec, and the 
fourth part of the mill of Haverbrec, with all the fuit belonging to the faid 
fourth part, and a moiety of the garden which had belonged to William de 
Haverbrec.
And Thomas fon of Elias de Gyle granted to the faid canons all 
his lands at Haverbrec, with the appurtenances *.

In the 37 Hen. 8.
Haverbrack-hall, manor, and capital meffuage, with 
divers appurtenances, late belonging to the priory of Conifhead, were granted 
by the crown to William Thornburgh gentleman ; to hold of the king in capite 
by the 20th part of one knight's fee, and a yearly rent of 18 s 3 d.
-f 
And by an inquifition afrer the death of the faid William, in the 7 Ja. 1.
it is found, that he died feifedof one capital meffuage called Dallam (Daleham) 
Tower, with 60 acres of land; fix other meffuages, with 100 acres of land, 
in Betham, Patten, and Lupton; the moiety of one corn-mill called Heron 
mill in Haverbrack ; two meffuages and 40 acres of land in Methope ; and 
two meffuages and 40 acres of land in Ulvey.
\ 
Another part of Haverbrack belonged to the Preftons.
The faid manor 
was afterwards purchafed by three mine adventurers in profpect of a lead mine *.
Afterwards it was fold to Henry Parker fecond brother of lord Morley, and by 
Edward Parker efquire was fold to Mr. Edward Wilfon, great grandfather of 
the prefent owner Daniel Wilfon efquire.
The ancient kail ftood at the high end of what is now called Dallam Tower 
garden, which the faid William Thorn burgh removed to the place where the 
ancient tower ftood, out of the ruins whereof he built a commodious dwel- 
ling-houfe, which in the year 1720 was rebuilt in a beautiful and elegant man- 
ner by the late Daniel Wilfon efquire.
The park was made about the fame 
time.
Behind it is a grove of fine oak wood.
In the park, a little eaftward from the hall, is a fmall hill, on the top of 
which formerly was.
a caftle, of a circular form ; and the hill is yet called 
Caftle-hill, and the fide thereof Caftle-bank.
In the turn of the river, oppofite to the north part of the houfe, is Dallam- 
wheel, where formerly was a very rapid eddy.
Three brothers, grown up to 
man's eftate, were bathing in this place; the circling water fucked in one of 
the brothers, the fecond going to his relief likewife perifhed, and the third in 
the attempt to preferve both met the fame fate.
The firft perfon of note of this family of Wilfon was Edward Wilfon of 
Nether Levins in the reign of king James the firft.
He was only farmer there, 
but acquired a very confiderable eftate-, and it was faid of him, that though 
he had many houfes, he never lived in a houfe of his own.
He was fucceeded by his kinfrnan, and heir Thomas Wilfon gentleman ; who 
had a ion and heir, 
Edward Wilfon efquire, who married to his firft wife Jane daughter of 
Gawen Brathwaite of Amblefide efquire, and by her had iffue Edward his fon 
and heir.
To his fecond wife he married Dorothy daughter of Richard Kirkby 
of Kirkby-hall in the county of Lancafter efquire, by whom he had iffue Ro- 
ger Wilfon efquire, anceftor of the late Roger Wilfon of Cafterton efquire.
Edward Wilfon efquire, fon and heir of Edward, was commonly denomi- 
nated of Parkhoufe, becaufe he refided there during the lifetime of his father 5 
which was an houie in the park belonging to Thirland caftle nigh Tunftal in

the rents of all his lands in Weftmorland and in Kendale â€¢, and (amongft the

of Prefton, Farleton, and Lupton *.
In the 49 Ed. 3.

On this attainder, the eftates being confifcated, king Henry the feventh 
granted the fame to Sir Ed-ward Stanley knighr, a younger fon of the firft earl 
of Derby, for his perfonal fervices in the Lancaftrian caufe.
Thus in the 4 Hen. 7.
there is a grant by that king to Edward Stanley 
knight, pro corpore fuo, of the manor of Farleton in Lounefdale in the county 
of Lancaster, and the manor of Farleton in Kendale in the county of Weft- 
morland, (with other places elfewhere) which lately belonged to James Har- 
rington knight, and which by reafon of the forfeiture of the faid James came 
to the hands of the king : To hold to the faid Edward and the heirs male of 
his body, of the king and his heirs for ever; without any account to be made 
to the kins' for the fame *.
And in the 5 Hen. 8.
after the death of the faid Edward Stanley lord Mont- 
eagle (which title he had given to him by king Henry the eighth for his fer- 
vices in war, having reference particularly to a mount or hill which he won in 
attacking the Scots at the battle of Flodden-field, and thereby obtained the 
victory, and alfo to the creft of his anceftors, in which they bore an eagle) â€” 
the inquifition finds, that in the firft year of king Henry the feventh, one 
James Harrington knight, for certain horrible treafons on the firft day of Auguft 
in the faid year by him committed, was convicted and attainted, and thereby 
forfeited to the king all his pofTeffions ; whereupon the faid king granted to the 
faid Edward Stanley lord Mcnteagle, by his letters patent bearing date the 8th 
day of March in the 4th year of his reign, the manor of Farleton in Lonfdale 
in the county of Lancaftcr, and the manor of Farleton in Kendale in the county 
of Weftmorland : And that the fame ought to defcend to the heirs male of the

â– which now is in our lord the now king, fon and heir of the faid king Henry

The arms of Harrington were â€¢, Sable, a frette Argent.
After this, we find the manor of Farleton in the hands of Sir Richard Hut- 
ton of Gouldfborough in Yorkfhire knight, one of the juftices of the court of 
common pleas, whofe dependents in the year 1693 fold the tenements to free- 
hold, there being then 19/ ijs $d cuftomary rent; and now remains only 
a free rent of 24 s yearly to the earl of Derby as fuperior lord.
At a fmall diftance from the village of Farleton, is an high hill called Farle- 
ton Knot-., on which, in the time of the Scotch incurfions, a beacon was fuftained

The Derby family were great fufferers in the civil wars in king Charles the 
firft's time.
The hall and demefne were conveyed to John Laybourn of Cuni- 
wick efquire for about 130/, which was fuppofed to have been a mortgage; 
but the defeifance, if there was any, did not appear.
The Laybourns continued 
at Witherflack in poffeffion, till the direct male line failed in coparceners ; 
one of whom was married to Dr. Marrmduke Witham of Yorkfhire : And the 
other coparceners died without iffue.
This eftate was fettled on the iffue of 
that marriage, and on failure thereof, remainder to the right heirs of Witham.
Dr. Witham had by that marriage a fon John Witham.
Againit this John 
Witham the prefent earl of Derby claimed the eftate, by virtue of a fetdemenc 
by a<5t of parliament, firft upon the Stanleys of Eynfham in the fouth, and then 
upon the Stanleys of Lancafhire-, and that branch in the fouth being all ex- 
tinct, and the late earl James being dead without iffue, he claimed as next of 
kin in remainder of the Lancafhire branch.

fercd by one of the Labourns was properly executed or not.
And on appeal to 
the houfe of lords, the queflion was determined in favour of his lordfhip.
In 
about 12 years afterwards, an ejectment was brought againft his lordfhip by 
the heir at law on the La bourn fide, in order to have the fame point tried over 
again, and a jury was fummoned from Weftmorland to try the caufe at the bar 
of the court of king's bench in 1759, and whilft in purfuance thereof the jury 
were attending, the original fettlement was found, whereby it appeared that 
the eflate was fettled and limited as aforefaid to the Withams and not to the 
Labourns, and the caufe thereupon on that ifTue was at an end, And the faid 
earl having levied a fine, which by the ilatute had run, all claim under the 
fettlement was precluded.
The park at Witherflack, when the Labourns inhabited there, was well 
flocked with fallow deer.
At this place there is a remarkable range of rocks called Whitbarrow Scar 
(from white the colour of the flone, and barrow a hill), which affords a ro- 
mantic profpect to the country all about.
The tenants are moil of them cuflomary, arbitrary, and heriotable.
By reafon of their great diflance from the parifh church, a chapel was an- 
ciently erected, about 20 yards fouth from the hall â€¢, and endowed with a falary 
of 20 nobles, part of which was paid by divers of the inhabitants of the parifh 
of Heverfham, for their convenience of reforting to the faid chapel : But fince 
the building of the new chapel, the faid payment hath ceafed.
Which new 
chapel was erected by Dr. John Barwick, dean of St. Paul's, who was born 
near the place where the chapel now ftands.
It was confecrated by bifhop Wil- 
kins in the year 1 67 r , by the name of the chapel of St. Paul in the town of 
Witherflack in the parifh of Betham ; with a claufe, as is ufual in like cafes,

The curate's houfe is about 30 yards fouth from the chapel, defigned alfo 
for a fchool-houfe, the curate being required by dean Barwick's eilablifhment 
to teach the children of the inhabitants gratis.
The earl of Derby, lord of the manor, allowed ground upon the common 
for a chapel-yard and for the fchool-houfe.
The curate is to be appointed by feoffees in truft, and by them to be no- 
minated to the bifhop.
For the fupport and maintenance of which curate, the faid Dr. John Bar- 
wick, by his will bearing date Oct. 21, 1664, reciting, that whereas the vil- 
lage or hamlet of Witherflack is four or five miles diftant from the parifh 
church, and is cut off from it by an interpofition of an arm of the fea twice 
every day, and is both troublefome and dangerous for paffage, efpecially for 
burial of the dead from the faid village, doth therefore devife the impropriate 
rectory or parfonage of Lazonby in the county of Cumberland (to which his 
brother Peter Barwick, M.
D. phyfician in ordinary to king Charles the fe- 
cond, added the capital meffuage or demefne eftate of Harefkeugh nigh Kirk 
Ofwald) for the purpofes of building a chapel, and allowing to the curate 
thereof 26/ a year, 40^ yearly to the vicar of Lazonby, 4/ yearly for the 
repairs of Witherflack chapel and providing utenfils and ornaments for the 
fame, and 10/ yearly to the binding out poor apprentices or marrying poor 
maids within the faid chapelry, and the refidue of the rents and profits (if any 
there be) to be difpofed of to any of the faid ufes as the truftees (hall agree.
And from the above donation appears in part the inconvenience of limiting 
a certain fum of money on the like occafions â€¢, which though agreeable to the 
intentions of the donor at that particular juncture, yet foon becomes inade- 
quate by the alteration of circumftances.
And this would have been the cafe 
here, if provifion had not been made for difpofal of the furplus.
The fum of 
26/ a year was then deemed a competent provifion for- the maintenance of a 
curate, being at that time at leaft double the value of the like fum at this day ; 
that is, it would purchafe as much of any of the accommodations of life, as 
double the fum will purchafe at prefent.
At the foundation of the ancient 
chapel at this place, twenty nobles were fet apart for the curate's ftipend.
And 
more anciently, by a canon of the church in archbifhop Sudbury's time, the 
general falary for curates was limited to 16 nobles a year-, and before that, 
by a canon of archbifhop Iflip, to 12 nobles.
All thefe provifions and limi- 
tations did intend one and the fame thing â€¢, and the incompetency hath arifen 
from the progreffive continual diminution of the value of money.
In the pre- 
fent cafe, over and above the limited fums, the aforefaid demefne and impro- 
priate reclory produce annually a clear fum of about 100/.
Cut of which, 
the trultees have been inabled to contribute towards procuring augmentations 
to the chapel from the governors of queen Anne's bounty, and in future times 
may be inabled to raife competent difiinct falaries both for a curate and fchool- 
mafter, if the curate fhall defire to be exempt from that charge himfelf.
In 
the mean while, a court of equity probably would direct the furplus to be diftri- 
buted according to the refpective proportions eftablifhed by the donors, as being 
leaft liable to the objection of partiality or mifapplication of any kind.

Burton, which is part in Kendal Ward, and part in Lonfdale Ward : from 
whence we fhall afterwards proceed through the reft of Lonfdale Ward 5 which

Burton is fometimes called Burton in Kendale, to diftinguifli it from another

this parifh confifts of five divisions, viz, Dalton (which is in Lancafhire), 
Burton, Holme, Holme Scales, and Prefton Patrick ; which two laft join no 
where on any of the other divifions, being ieparated by Farleton in the pa- 
rifh of Betham : And it is faid there is a fmali parcel of land, not belonging 
to this parifh, which is furrounded with the townfhip of Burton.
The church is faid to be dedicated to St. Helen, indicated by a well about 60 
yards north-eaft from the church, which bears the name of that faint.
It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at j 5/ ijs $\d.
The clear 
yearly value as certified to the governors of queen Anne's boonty 31 I 6s 8d.
This church was given (amongft the reft), together with one carucate of 
land, by Ivo de Talebois to the abbey of St. Mary's York, and confirmed to 
that abbey by Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred.
In 1359, it was appropriated to the faid abbey, referving a penfion of 40J- 
yearly to the archdeacon of Richmond, 3s 4-d to the archbifhop, and 3; ^.d to 
the dean and chapter of York.
In 1460, the vicar's portion was fet out as 
follows; viz.
20 /a year, confiding of an houfe and garden, and a clofe called.
Kirk-Butts, with all fmall tithes, oblations, and mortuaries living and dead : 
he paying thereout 10/ 3 s \d yearly to the faid convent, repairing the chancel, 
and bearing all burdens ordinary and extraordinary.
After the difTolution of the monafteries, the rectory of this church and 
advowfon of the vicarage were granted by queen Elizabeth in the 20th year of 
her reign to Edward earl of Lincoln and Chriftopher Gough gentleman; with 
refervation of a rent to the crown of 9/ ys 8i; to the fchoolmafter of Ken- 
dal 9/ 5 s Sd; to the curate of Hewgill 3/ 6s $d-, and to the bifhop of 
Cbefter 2/.
The advowfon appears foon after to have been in the hands of the Middle- 
tons of Leighton in Lancafhire.
The laft of whom, Sir George Middleton 
baronet, had a daughter and heir Mary, who by marriage carried the fame to 
the Oldfields of Somerforth in Chefhire, who fold the fame (together with the 
manor of Burton and demefne of Claythorp-hall) to Mr. Benifon of Hornby 
attorney at law ; whofe daughter, the prefent Mrs. Fenwick of Hornby, fold 
the advowfon to Mrs. Hutton of Kirkby Lonfdale, who fold the fame to Mr.
Lancafter of Sedgefield in the county of Durham, who fold the fame to the 
prefent patrons Mr. Thomas Hutton of the parifh of Kirkby Lonfdale, and 
Mr. Jeffrey Tenant of the parifh of Bentham in Yorkfhire.
The reftory or great tithes appear to have been in the name and family of 
the Preftons of Prefton Patrick ; the laft of whom had two daughters, married 
to the lords Montgomery and Clifford, between whom the inheritance was di- 
vided; lord Montgomery had the tithes of Burton, Holme, and Dalton, 
which came by purchafe to colonel Francis Charteris grandfather of the pre- 
fent owner the honourable Francis Charteris -, and lord Clifford had the tithes 
of Prefton Patrick and Holme Scales, which the prefent lord Clifford fold 
fome few years ago to Mrs. Gibfon of Lancafter.
In the year 1732, in a caufe between the parishioners and the vicar Mr.
John Benifon, the vicarial tithes and revenues of the church were afcertained, 
and decreed in chancery ; in which decree there are fpecined divers parcels of

and, amongft others, the following remarkable particulars â€¢, for burial in the 
church or churchyard thall be paid 1 s, except of women that die in child- 
bed, for whom nothing is due â€¢, the modus for tithe lambs (hall be double for 
the two firft years after induction of a new vicar; and every perfon keeping a 
plough fhall pay yearly 1 J, in lieu and full fatisfa&ion of agiftment of barren 
cattle, which laft article feems contrary to the general rule of law, which doth 
not allow of one tithe being paid in lieu of another, and it fhould feem to 
follow from hence that if a man doth not keep a plough he fhall pay tithe of 
agiftment.
The prefent vicarage-houfe and glebe were purchafed with queen Anne's 
bounty money.
The aforefaid inclofure called Kirk- Butts hath been feifed by 
the lords of the manor, who were for fome time patrons alfo of the ad- 
vowfon.
The church is a pretty good old building, with two rows of pillars ; and a 
fquare tower, with three bells.
There are two iles â€¢, one en the north fide, 
belonging to Dakon-hall ; and the other on the fouth fide belonging to Prcf- 
ton-hall.
Nigh to the churchyard wall on the eaft fide, is xhefcbool; with a-fmall en- 
dowment, being the intereft of feveral fums of money contributed by the in- 
habitants, to the amount of about 117/.
The ground on which it is fituate 
was given by Mr. John Hutton of Burton, anceftor of the prefent worthy 
vicar the reverend John Hutton.
Another gentleman of the fame name, a 
native of Burton, by his will dated in the year 16 -,7, gave 40 s yearly to the 
poor of the parifh of Burton, and 20 s to the poor of the parifh of Cockfield 
in the county of Durham, out of his eft ate at Hindon in the faid parifti of 
Cockfield.
The refidue of the rents and profits of the faid eftate he gave to 
a fchoolmafter at Burton, who fhould be mafter of arts of Oxford or Cam- 
bridge, and officiate every Sunday as curate at Prefton chapel.
The faid 
fchoolmafter to be chofen by a majority of houfholders within the parifh.
In 
defect of fuch fchoolmafter, then the faid refidue to go to the poor of the 
parifti of Burton and the poor of the parifh of Betham, to each an equal fhare.
It is probable he expected fome larger benefactions to the fchool : for this 
whole eftate at prefent yields no more than 1 3 / a year.
The chapel, as it 
feemeth, had then no curate, and he intended this as a kindnefs to the inha- 
bitants, and not as thinking to impofe a curate by his own authority.
Though 
this happened to be the occafion of fome doubt afterwards concerning the 
manner of appointing the curate.

PARISH AND MANOR OF BURTON.

King Richard the firft granted to Gilbert Ton of Roger Fitz-Reinfred two 
carucates of land in Borton, and four carucates in Prefton and Holme.
The manor feems to have been then or foon after granted to a family of the 
name de Burton : for when this fame Roger Fitz-Reinfred was obliged to give 
hoftages for his fidelity to king John, one of the faid hoftages was the heir 
of Roger de Burton.
In the 25 Ed. r.
Roger de Burton knight (probably grandfon of the former) 
was one of the witnefifes, together with Richard de Prefton and Matthew de Red- 
man knights, to a grant of lands at Old Hutton and Holme Scales, by John 
de Culwen to Patrick de Culwen his brother.
In the 26 Ed. 1.
Roger de Burton reprefented the county of Westmorland irt 
parliament.
After this, we have found nothing more concerning the family de Burton % 
moft probably it ended in daughters : for in the 4 Hen. 7.
after the attainder 
of Sir James Harrington, the inquifition finds, that he was feifed of a moiety 
of the manor of Burton in Kendale.
This manor appears to have been fome time after in the hands of the 
Middletons of Leighton, whofe heir female was married to Oldfield, who fold 
the manor to Thomas Benifon of Hornby efquire, whofe daughter and heir 
carried the fame by marriage to JohnFenwick of Borrow-hall efquire, whofe bro- 
ther and heir Thomas Fenwick efquire, in purfuance of an aÂ£t of parliament 
for that purpofe, fold the fame to Thomas Pearfon efquire, the prefent owner.
The hall or manor-houfe is about a quarter of a mile fouth from the church, 
and is now converted to tenancy.
The tenants only pay a twopenny fine, that is, doubling the rent ; and no 
heriot.
The town of Burton is tolerably well built, and a pretty good thorough- 
fare between Kendal and Lancafter.
It was procured to be a market-town in 
1 66 1, by Sir George Middleton aforefaid j the market-day to be on Tuefday 
in every week, and two fairs yearly on April 23, and Whitfun-Monday.
It 
is faid to be the largeft corn market in the county, the corn being brought 
chiefly out of Lancashire, and fold to the dealers at Kendal, Sedbergh, and 
other places.
To the weft of Burton and Holme is a large tracT: of marfhy ground, con- 
fifting chiefly of peat mofs.
The inhabitants are at prefent occupied in drain- 
ing thefe mofles, having expended fome hundreds of pounds therein.
The 
main drain is between two and three miles long, about four yards broad, and 
two yards deep : befides feveral fmaller, and many private drains.
At the bot- 
tom of the peat mofs, is a bed of whitiih earth, which is neither fand, nor clay, 
nor marl, and yet in fome refpects refembles each of them.
It every where 
abounds with innumerable fmall fhells of the fnail and periwinkle kind, and 
fuch as appear fometimes in limeftone and marble.
There are alfo trunks of 
large trees, both of fir and oak-

HOLME AND HOLME SCALES.
About a mile and an half north from the church is the village of Holme ; 
which was anciently divided between two lords, of the names of Prefton and 
Tunfdal : And hence one half of the tenants are heriotable, and the other 
not.
The Tunfdal tenants were free from heriots, but deeper charged in their 
rents.
They lie interfperfed, and are only diftinguifhable by their rentals.
Here is no manor-houfe, but a large park, called Holme-Park, about three 
miles in circumference ; which in Sir Thomas Prefton's time was well reple- 
niftied with fallow deer.
Holme Scales belonged anciently to Holme, and is in the pari(h of Bur- 
ton â€¢, but it is in the chapelry and conftablewick of Old Hutton.
This alfo 
belonged to the Tunfdals and Preftons, and after came to the Preftons only.
The prefent lord of thefe manors is the aforefaid Francis Charteris efquire.

PRESTON PATRICK.
It is mod likely, that Prefton Patrick received its prefent denomination from 
the fame perfon who gave name to Bampton Patrick.
Bampton and Prefton 
Patrick belonged both to the fame family, defcended from Ivo de Talebois firft 
baron of Kendal after the Conqueft.
And the individual perfon of that fa- 
mily, from whom both thefe places received their denomination was, very 
probably, Patricius de Culwen, anceftor to the Curwens of Workington, who 
was grandfon of Thomas fon of Cofpatrick who gave lands and pofiefllons 
to the abbey at Prefton about the year 1 1 1 9, which abbey was afterwards 
removed to Shap.
Which Cofpatrick was fon of Orme, fon of Ketel, fon of 
Eldred, fon of Ivo de Talebois aforefaid.
Prefton is by fome fuppofed to have been fo called from the abbey aforefaid, 
as much as to fayPrieft-town : But if it had this name upon any fuch religious 
account, it was before the foundation of the abbey many years j for at the 
time of the Conqueft it was called Preftun.
The grant of Thomas fon of Cofpatrick to the faid abbey was to the follow- 
ing effecl:: " To all fons of our holy mother the church, as well prefent as to

His faid wife the lady 
Mary died before him in the year 1673, and was buried in the fouth ile of the 
chancel of Heverfham church, whofe monument remaineth there to this day.
And Sir Thomas becoming a widower, was perfuaded by the Romifh priefts 
to return to his former function.
Upon which, he fettled his Westmorland 
eftate on his two daughters, and went beyond the feas ; having firft fettled his 
Lancafhire eftate, called The Manor, upon the Jefuits.
On which grant there 
was a trial in the exchequer, and the eftate was adjudged forfeited to the king; 
who feized upon the fame, and granted a leafe thereof to Thomas Prefton of 
Holker efquire.
As to the reft, in the partition of the eftate, the manor of Prefton Patrick 
was afllgned to the elder fifter, in whofe family it continued till the year 1717, 
when William Herbert efquire commonly called duke of Powis and Mary 
his wife, and William Herbert commonly called lord Montgomery (their fon 
and heir apparent), conveyed to Francis Charteris of Hornby-caftle efquire 
the manors of Prefton Patrick and Holme, with the capital mefluage or man- 
fion-houfe called Prefton-hall; and fee farm rent of 15s 4 d, being the.
tithe 
hay filver of Prefton Patrick aforefaid ; and alfo all thofe parks or lands com- 
monly known by the names of Holme Park, Lodge Park, and Wood Park, 
containing by eftimation 185 acres; and the tithes and tithe barns of Dalton, 
Holme, and Burton; and the lands called Hutton Park, containing by efti- 
mation 137 acres, andcuftomary rents of 42/ 8^ 3^, with fines and heriots.
Finally, in 1773, Francis Charteris of Hornby-caftle efquire, grandfon of 
the aforefaid Francis Charteris, granted the infranchifement of the faid manor, 
for the fum of 5130/, to William Bateman, Thomas Cartmell, and Richard 
Wright, in behalf of themfclves and as many other of the tenants as fhall 
chufe to purchafe.
The faid manor-houfe of Prefton-hall is an old building, in a low, damp, 
and moift fituation, but now converted into a good farm-houfe : Part of the 
ancient fabric ftill remains, particularly two large arched rooms, which feem 
to have been cellars.
On the weft fide of the hall is the park; in the north end whereof is the 
keeper's houfe ; and in the time of the Preftons the faid park was well re- 
plenifhed with fallow deer.
Next to Prefton-hall, the moft confiderable place is Challen-hall, belonging 
to Mr. Roger Dickinfon, who hath lately rebuilt the fame in a neat and hand-

fome manner.
In which anciently have been, and are ftill kepr, the courts 
for the Lowther tenants in this manor.
It was anciently called Chanon-hall, 
probably from its having belonged to the canons or monks of the abbey *.
. In the middle of the park Hands the chapel, about a quarter of a mile from- 
the hall.
It is a neat, handfome building, Handing on an eminence, with a 
fine profpec~l every way.
There is a well about 200 yards diftant from the' 
chapel eaftward, called St. Gregory's well â€¢, which leads probably to the name 
of the faint, to whom the chapel is dedicated.
Mr. Machel takes notice of a yew tree in the chapel-yard, which he fays 
was very old and decayed (viz.
in the year 1692); which fhews, he obferves, 
the antiquity of the chapel.
The yew tree is there yet, which fhews alfo the 
. longevity of that fpecies of wood.
Thefe yew trees in church and chapel 
yards feem to have been intended originally for the ufe of archery, the beft 
bows being made of that wood, and our anceftors having remarkably excelled 
in that kind of exercife.
But this is only matter of conjecture ; antiquity hav- 
ing not furnifhed any account (fo far as we have been able to find) of the de- 
fign of this kind of plantation.
There is no dwelling-houfe belonging to the curate â€¢, but an ancient falary of 
five marks a year, payable out of the reipective tenements within the chapelry.
By the fmallnefs of which falary, this feemeth not to have been the oratory 
for which Richard Prefton obtained a faculty in the 30 Hen. 6.
for at that 
time no chapel feems to have been allowed without fetting apart for the curate 
juft double the falary of five marks, viz.
20 nobles (the reafon of reckoning 
by marks and nobles was becaufe their coins were of that denomination).
â€” So 
that the foundation of this chapel feems to have been much earlier than the 
reign of king Henry the fixth.
But the faculty for an oratory which Richard 
Prefton obtained, was probably a licence to keep a domeftic chaplain, which it 
was not lawful to do without licence from the ordinary, left it might be the 
occafion of herefy, and alfo left injury might arife to the incumbent of the 
mother church in oblations or otherwife.
There is alio belonging to this chapel an eftate of about 18/ a year pur- 
chafed by queen Anne's bounty, 100/ given by lady Moyer, and fubferiptions 
in the neighbourhood, for the obtaining of that bounty.
In the reign of king George the fecond, there was a long difpute between 
Mr. John Benifon vicar of Burton and the inhabitants of this chapelry con- 
cerning the appointing a curate; the vicar claiming as of common right, and 
the inhabitants as by cuftom for time immemorial.
And at length it was 
determined in favour of the inhabitants.
And this is the cafe in moft of the 
old chapelries ; where the falaries having been very fmall, it was rather a 
burden than an advantage to the incumbents of the mother churches to pro- 
vide a curate : And therefore they voluntarily gave up their claim to the inha- 
bitants ; who having made choice of a peribn, fuch as they liked (who gene- 
rally by the terms of the contribution from the inhabitants towards a falary 
was required to teach a fchool alfo), the faid inhabitants prefented the perfon 
* lifhop Nicolfon.
1 elected 
PARISH OF BURTON.
(Preston Patrick.) 243 
elected by them to the incumbent, to be by him prefented to the bifhop for 
his licence.
And from hence chiefly hath arifen the claim, and by length of 
time the legal right, of the inhabitants and landowners within the chapelries 
chufing their own curate.
â€” Generally, indeed, that which is deemed a privi- 
lege, is a real inconvenience.
Popular elections s.ie often conducted by pre- 
judice, and perpetuate party-diftinctions from one generation to another.
And 
a clergyman's fituation muft needs be uncomfortable, who comes in againft the 
oppofition of perhaps a confiderable part of his hearers.
And, there is often 
great irregularity in this kind of election.
In order to make fuch election 
valid, it is not the fitted method for a few perfons to go about in the neigh- 
bourhood, and get the electors to fet their hands to a nomination â€¢, but there 
ought to be a meeting, after previous notice for that purpofe (which notice 
the chapel-warden, as having charge of the chapel during the vacancy, feems 
the propereft to give), and at fuch meeting the curate to be chofen by a ma- 
jority of votes.
And it is not a canonical election, unlefs it be by a majority 
of the whole number; as if there be nine electors (for inftance) and four vote 
for one candidate, and three for another, and two for another, none of thofe 
candidates is elected, inafmuch four cannot prefent againft five.
And it feem- 
eth that perfons abfent cannot vote by proxy for any particular candidate, fig- 
nified by letter, or viva voce evidence ; but there ought to be, upon ftamp, 
a power of attorney, generally, to act in the election for the abfent party, 
ratifying and confirming what fuch proxy fhall do in the premifies.
And the 
general cuftom is, that all perfons chargeable to pay chapel falary have a right 
to vote â€¢, which includes widows, and infants alfo of whatever age (as infants, 
even of tender years, may prefent to a rectory or vicarage).

Kirkby Lonfdale is the largeft town in the county, next unto Kendal ; and is 
beautifully fituate upon the banks of the river, over which there is a large 
ftone bridge of three arches â€¢, for the repair of which bridge, there was a 
grant of pontage in the third year of King Edward the firft.
The parijh of Kirkby Lonfdale is bounded on the Eaft by the limits of the

The church is dedicated to St. Mary ; and was given by Ivo de Talebois to 
the abbey of St. Mary's York, and confirmed to the fame by Gilbert fon of 
Roger Fitz-Reinfred *.
The impropriation, and patronage of the vicarage, after the diflblution of the

The market: and fair at Kirkby Lonfdale were granted in' the 11 Hen. 3, 
And in the 20 Ed. 1, a Quo warranto was brought againft the abbot of St.
Mary's York, to fhew, why he claimed a market, fair, afilze of bread and* 
beer, tumbrel, pillory, infangthief, and gallows.
Unto which he anfwered, 
that he claimed a market and fair as parfon of the church there, by a charter 
of king Henry the third, dated' in the 11th year of his reign ; by which* 
charter, the faid king granted to John de Kirkeby, parfon of the church in< 
Kirkeby in Lonefdale, .
that he and his fuccefibrs, parfons of the church afore- 
faid, fhall have for ever a fair at Kirkeby in Lonefdale, upon the land of the 
faid church, every year for three days, to wit, on the eve, day, and morrow 
of the nativity of the bleffed virgin Mary [viz.
Sep. 7, 8, and 9.], and that 
they fhall have one market there, on Thurfday in every week.
Infangthief 
and gallows he claimeth not â€¢, but the afilze of bread and beer, tumbrel, and 
pillory he claimeth, as annexed and appurtenant to the faid market and fair.
And becaufe it appeared, that the faid king Henry was under age at the time 
of the faid grant, the faid market and fair were taken into the king's hands.
Afterwards, it was accorded, that the faid abbot fhould enjoy the faid liber-

But though the abbot difclaimed the infangthief and gallows, yet itfeemeth 
that his fucceffors did not intirely give up all jurifdietion of pleas of the crown ; 
for the lord of the manor to this day claimeth and exercifeth a power of ap- 
pointing a coroner within the faid manor.
The church ftands in a pleafant fituation, upon the banks of the river ; in 
a large, level, and beautiful churchyard.
It is 120 feet in length, and 102 
feet in breadth, and hath 3 rows of pillars.
The fteeple is about 68 foot high, 
.and hath fix good bells.
At the eaft end of the north ile is Middleton quire, where in Mr. Machel's 
time were the ruins of a fine monument in alabafter of a dufkifh red colour; 
having been formerly the effigies of a man in armour, with his fword girt to 
his fide, lying on his back, with his hands elevated, and his head refting upon 
an helmet; and the figure of a woman lying by him.
And amongll feveral 
coats of arms defaced, the two firft remained almoft intire ; the former was 
Middleton fingle, and the latter Middleton impaling Tunftal.
Which feem 
plainly to indicate the fame to have been the monument of John Middleton of 
Middleton-hall efquire, fon of Sir Geoffrey Middleton who lived in the reign 
of king Henry the eighth ; which John married a daughter of Tunftal of 
"Thurland cattle.
The fouth porch or quire was built by one Mr. Baynes of Hegholme-hall,

which he afterwards exchanged for Kirkby Lonfdale, as being nearer to his 
own country, where his Scotch pronunciation would be lefs ofFenfive, and 
better underflood.
During the progrefs of the rebellion, he fuffered greatly, 
being perfecuted by two of his parifhioners, who were captains in the parlia- 
ment army, and got him not only fequeftred, but alio feveral times hurried to 
Lancafler gaol, once out of the church, another time out of his bed from hus- 
wife then big v/ith child, the Lift of which times he fuffered near three years 
imprifonment.
After which, being fet at liberty, he fled into Yorkfhire, 
where he obtained a finall living of about 20/ a year, and on the reftoration 
came back to his vicarage at Kirkby Lonfdale, where he did not long con- 
tinue, being made prebendary of Carlifle, and inftituted to a living in that 
neighbourhood.
â€” It was obferved, that one of the two captains, who had been 
the chief inftruments in his fufferings, grew very rich, and purchafed a field 
and built a very fine houfe with the wages of iniquity, but before his death he 
became miferably poor, and was caff, into gaol, where he was daily relieved 
from the table of one of Mr. Buchanan's fons Â£.
[Which fon, probably, was 
James Buchanan, who was made vicar of Appleby in 1661.] 
There was heretofore a chapel at Tarnfide in this lordfhip, which was de- 
molifhed about 100 years ago.
At the eaft corner of the churchward, is a place called Abbot- hall (which is 
now only an ordinary houfe).
It belonged to the abbey aforefaid, and is faid 
to have been the place where they kept their courts.
There is alfo a place in this lordmip called Dean's Bigging.
This alfo belonged; 
to the abbey; and perhaps might be the feat of the Rural Deanry, which from 
this place ftill retains the name of the deanry of Kirkby Lonfdale.
About 100 yards eaftward from the church, nigrT the river fide, ftands the 
fchool-houfe \ the foundation whereof was as follows : One Godfalve of New- 
ton in the parifh of Whittington, gave 100/ to be difpofed of towards a free- 
fchool, at the difcretion of the then rector of Whittington, one Mr. Bland, a 
native of Kirkby Lonfdale.
The faid Mr. Bland, in confideration that the 
town of Kirkby Lonfdale was the principal market town of thofe parts, and 
only one mile diftant from Whittington, propofed that the faid 100/ fhould 
be laid out towards the eftablifhrhent of a free grammar-fchool at Kirkby Lonf- 
dale, provided that the inhabitants of the town or parifh would add another 
100/ to the fame ufe.
Which was accordingly done.
And queen Elizabeth, 
in the 33d year of her reign, granted letters patent for the foundation of a free 
grammar-fchool at Kirkby Lonfdale, and therein appointed 24 governors of 
the faid fchool.
The lady Curwen before mentioned, heirefs of the family of 
Cams, gave the ground upon which the fchool-houfe was erected ; and alfo 
gave certain parcels of land to the fame, lying near to a place called the Big- 
gins.

The fchool-houfe at firft being but an indifferent building, one Mr. Henry 
Wilfon of Blackwell-hall London, a native of Kirkby Lonfdale, did in the 
year 1628 caufe the fame to be taken down, and at his own expence rebuilt the 
lame in a more fpacious and convenient manner.
And in regard the former 
falary was applied to the fole ufe of the matter, he gave 120/ for the fupporc 
of an ufher ; which, together with other charity money, was charged upon the 
demefne lands of Thurland caflle in the parifh of Tunftal.
Mr. Thomas Wilfon, a clergyman in Norfolk, brother to the faid Henry, 
gave 200 / to be laid out in land, the produce whereof was to go to the mafter 
and fellows of Chrift's college in Cambridge, to be by them applied as exhi- 
bitions for 3 poor fcholars going from this fchool to the faid college, at 5 / 
a year each, till they be of Handing to commence mailers of arts.
Which 
fum was laid out in a meflliage and tenement at Bulbank in the panfti of 
Melling.
And the aforefaid Henry Wilfon gave 400/, fecured upon the tithes of 
Farleton, for exhibitions for 7 poor fcholars, 4 of them from the faid fchool 
â€¢of Kirkby Lonfdale, and 3 from the fchool of Kendal, to Queen's college in 
Oxford, the faid fcholars to be natives of Weftmorland or Cumberland.
He 
gave alio 500/ to the poor of Kirkby Lonfdale ; with many other charities to 
other places.
The faid Henry Wilfon alfo eredled a fmall library in the church, at the eafl 
end of the north ile, over the veftry j and gave feveral books to it.
This family of Wilfon had confiderable pofTeffions in the townihip of Kirkby 
Lonfdale about that time.
For among the Efcheats in the 10 Ja. it is found 
by inquifition, that Henry Wiljon (probably of the eldeft branch of the family) 
held, on the day on which he died, 12 mefluages and tenements in Keaf- 
thwaite, Manferghe, Dean's Bigging, and other places, of the king in capite, 
as of the Richmond fee : and that Jane wife of Nicolas Borrett, and Mary 
wife of Thomas Gibfon, were his daughters and coheirs.
And in the 13 Ja. Nicolas Borret and Jane his wife conveyed her moiety 
in fee to Edward Burrow and feven others ; confifting of fix mefluages and 
tenements, and divers other parcels of land, all in the lordfhip of Kirkby 
Lonfdale.
One male branch of this family continued at Underley till about the year 
1730, when Mr. Thomas Wilfon fold Underley to Hugh Afhton gentleman, 
from whom the premhTes defcended to his fon James Afhton efquire, who died 
unmarried, leaving 4 fitters coheirs j viz.
Elizabeth married to Mr. Jofeph.
Burrow of Whitehaven, Frances married to Mr. Arthur Burrow of Lupton, 
Anne married to Mr. William Birdfworth of Kirkby Lonfdale, and Eleanor 
married to Mr. Thomas Cams of Kirkby Lonfdale.

CASTERTON AND JgiLTTQN ROOF.
Caste rton and Button Roof, although feparated by the river, have 
commonly been confidered as one manor only ; and perhaps fo they might be 
originally : but fo far back, as we have now any account, they have been fepa- 
rate and diftinct.
Cafterton (which lies on the Eaft fide of the river) did probably receive its 
name from fome caftle erected there ; of which neverthelefs there are now no 
veftiges remaining.
â€” Mutton Roof feems to be no more than the top or higher 
part of Hutton ; which name of Button was frequently given to places, where 
a number of huts or fmall houfes of habitation were let up : And particularly 
in thefe parts, which were appendent to Kendal caftle, befides Hutton Roof, 
there was Old Hutton, New Hutton, and Hutton in the Hay .
In the 12 Ed. 2.
the manor of Cafterton appears to have been in the pof- 
feffion of lngelram de Gynes and Chriftian his wife.
In the 25 Ed. 3.
we find one third part of the manor of Cafterton holden 
by Gilbert de Burnejhead of William de Coucy grand fon of the faid lngelram, by 
cornage, wardftiip, and relief.
â€” And at the fame time, the manor of Hutton 
Roof "was holden of the faid William, by John de Hutton Roofe and Agnes who 
had been the wife of John Dursfleete, by the like fervice of cornage, wardftiip, 
and relief.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
after the death of Joan de Coupland, the inquifition finds, 
that (he died feifed of the manor of Cafterton, with the appurtenances.
â€” And 
that Hugh de Morejby held of her the manor of Hutton Roofe, as of her manor 
of Kirkeby in Kendale â€¢, by homage, fealty, and the fervice of 8 s a year : 
And that Simon de Heverjham held of her divers tenements there, of the yearly 
fent of 3 j 4 d.
In an old rental, 7 Hen. 7.
when Sir Thomas Strickland was fteward, for 
two parts of Cafterton were paid 60s id rents and farms-, Ss yd free rent of 
afiize paid by four different tenants by name; 5s 6d free rent for the lands 
called Symington's lands-, 4 d new rent of Chriftopher Symfon for licence of 
putting a grindftone in Cafterton beck, to be turned by the water thereof; 
for the fulling mill, nothing, becaufe it was in the lord's hands for want of 
repair.
Amongft the Efcheats in the 13 Cha. 1.
it is found, that George Stockdak 
held 3 mefluages and tenements in Cafterton, late purchafed of William Daven- 
port knight (father of judge Davenport), of the king as of his manor of Kirkby 
in Kendale, late called Richmond Fee, by the 100th part of one knight's fee; 
and that he held alfo one water corn mill there, of the king as of his manor of 
Eaft Greenwich in Kent, in free focage, and by the rent of 20;.
By an inquifition in the 28 Cha. 2.
it is found, that Catherine queen conforr, 
in the 21ft year of the faid king, for 50/ fine paid, granted to Edward Wilfon 
of Cafterton gentleman, all thole lands and tenements in Cafterton (except 
Vol. I.

(Casterton, &c.) 
great trees, and all woods and underwoods, mines, and quarries) for g% years, 
if Edward^ Thomas* and Roger Wilfon* fons of the laid Edward* fhould fo long 
live; paying the yearly rent of ill 6s 8 d.
In Hut ton Roof there was anciently a park* and there is an houfe which is yec 
called the Park houfe; which in the reign of Ed. 6.
belonged to judge Carus * 
after that, was purchafed by the Bellinghams of Levins ; then by the Preftons* 
and finally, by Colonel Francis Charteris (together with divers other of the 
Pre/ion eftates), and by him devifed to his grandfon Francis Charteris efquire, 
the prefent owner, fecond fon of the earl of Wemyfs in Scotland.
The tenants of Cafterton are about half free, and half cuftomary, paying a 
fine certain of 3 years ancient rent, and a prefcription of 40 s for an heriot.
The tenants of Hutton Roof are all free, paying a quit-rent to the crown.
And they have been fo long free, that there hath appeared to us no memorial 
or remembrance when or by whom they were infranchifed.
Some part of Hut- 
ton Roof belonged to the abbey of St. Mary's York, being given thereto by 
Ivo de Talebois ; and the free tenure of this is eafily accounted for, inafmuch 
as the religious generally held their lands free from all fecular exaction and 
fervicc.
The chapel of Hutton Roof* fo far as one may judge by the fmallnefs of the 
original falary, which is 12 nobles, feems to be very ancient.
It hath now 
belonging to it three eftates purchafed by queen Anne's bounty and other aug- 
mentations, of the yearly value of about 40/.
In Cajierton there are two houfe3 called Chapel houfes* and a place near unto 
them called Chapel head clofe, where a chapel formerly flood, but the ground is 
now ploughed up.
And there is a well nigh unto it, called St. Coumes [St.
Columbe's] wellj to which faint the chapel probably was dedicated.
Amongft the particulars made out in the reign of king Charles the firft, for 
the fale of the Richmond fee and other crown lands in Weftmorland, there is 
mentioned a coal mine in Cafterton, of which Roger Bateman propofed to be 
purchafer.
III.
L U P T O N.
Lupton (called in Domefday Lupetun) belonged, like as the reft, to the 
barons of Kendal ; and was holden under them for a long time by the Redmans 
of Levins.
In which family it continued till the reign of king Henry the 
feventh.
For by an inquifition in the 4th year of that king, it is found, that 
Thomas Harrington efquire (then attainted) held lands in Lupton of Edward 
Redman efquire, but by what fervices the jury did not know.
This Edward feems to have been the laft of that branch of the family, and 
their Weftmorland eftates were fold foon after.
Unto whom Lupton imme- 
diately 
PARISH OF KIRKBY LONSDALE.
(Lvptou.) * 5 e 
diately was granted, we have not found.
The Bellinghams purchafed Levins, 
and probably Lupton likewife.
For Lupton, like as molt of* the reft of the 
Bellingham eftates, is of the Lumley fee.
Afterwards it appears to have belonged to Sir Richard Hutton of Goldfbo- 
rough in Yorkfhire, one of the juftices of the court of common pleas; one of 
whofe daughters was married to Sir Philip Mufgrave of Hartley caftle baronet, 
whofe fon and heir Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave knight (afterwards baronet) in the 
year 1681 purchafed the fame of the truftees of the faid Sir Richard; whofe 
defcendent Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet is now owner thereof.
There are only about two freehold tenements in the whole manor: All the 
reft are cuftomary.
IV.
BARBON AND MANSERGH.
Barbon and Mansergh are faid to have been originally one manor; and 
only broken into feparate divifions for convenience, by reafon of the river 
Lune running between.
But fo early as the Domefday furvey they appear to 
have been feparate; for c Tofi earl of Northumberland held Berebrune (as it is 
there called), and Torfin held Manferge.
In the reign of king Henry the third, Richard de Berebume knight was one 
of the witneffes to the grant of Skelfmergh by William de Lancaftre to Robert 
de Leyburne.
In the reigns of Ed. 1.
and Ed. 2.
we find divers others of the name.
In 
the 18 Ed. 3.
the manor of Barborne and divers lands in Middleton were con- 
veyed to Roger Laffels and Elianor his wife, but by whom was not legible when 
the copy of the record was taken *.
Poffibly it might be fome fettlement on 
Lafiels's marrying the heirefs of Bereburne.
In the 25 Ed. 3.
Ralph Laffels held the manor of Berburne of William de 
Coucy ; by cornage, wardfhip, and relief.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
Ralph Lafcells held the manor of Barburne of Joan de 
Coupland, by homage and fealty, and the fervice of 30 s yd, as of her manor 
of Kirkby in Kendale.
We find nothing further in particular relating to this manor till the 23 Eliz.
when it appears to have been in the name of Vaughan.
For in that year Francis 
Vaughan efquire conveyed the fame to Sir Thomas Boynton knight and Francis 
Boynton efquire, in truft, for the ufe of the lady Anne Knyveit for life, re- 
mainder to Francis Vaughan and his heirs.
About 30 years after this, the manor was purchafed of Vaughan, by John, 
Middleton of Middleton-hall efquire; who fold the fame not long after to fer- 
jeant (afterwards judge) Shuttlewcrth ; who gave the fame to his nephew Richard 
Shuttleworth of Gauthorp efquire, whofe fon fames Sbultleworth efquire now 
enjoys the fame.
The faid Richard, in the year 1716, fold all the tenements 
to freehold, referving an annual free rent of 15/ 8 s.

(Barbon, &c.) 
The ancient chapel falary of Barbon was 2/ 10 s od; in lieu of which the 
inhabitants gave a valuable confideration, wherewith in conjunction with an 
allotment of 200/ from queen Anne's bounty an eftate was purchafed in Bar- 
bon now let at the yearly rent of 1 1 /.
And with a further allotment of 200/ 
an eftate was purchafed at Kellet in Lancafhire, now let at the yearly rent of 
.7/ 4 s.
So that the whole revenue is 18/ 4s od.
John Garnet of Barbon gave fome lands which were fold for 105/; one half 
of the intereft whereof is paid to the curate or fchoolmafter for teaching 4 poor 
children of the chapelry, and the other half to the poor.
Manse rgh feems anciently to have been in the name of a family de Ma)> 
fergh.
Amongft the fines in the 12 Ed. 2.
we find that Thomas de Manfergb 
purchafed certain lands in Barbourne, And efpecially, in the 7 Ric. 2.
John 
de Manfergb was chofen knight to rep re fen t the county of Weftmorland in par- 
liament.
Neverthelefs Rigmaden hall, which is faid to have been the ancient manor- 
houfe, was in the hands of a family of the name de Rigmaden.
It is poffible, 
the Manferghs refiding there might affume the name de Rigmaden, Their arms 
were; Argent, 3 flags heads couped Sable.
After the Rigmadens, this place came into the name and family of Ward t 
who continued there for a confiderable time, and had poffefllons alfo in Kil- 
lington, Firbank, and other places.
The lad of whom, Henry Ward, fold 
the fame to Mr. Thomas Godfalve merchant, who had a fon Thomas Godfalve 
gentleman, whofe daughter Margaret widow of the reverend Thomas Maude- 
fley now enjoys the fame.
The chapel of Manfergh was built by Mr. Jacob Dawfon on his eftate called 
Nether Hall ; towards defraying the expence whereof, the inhabitants agreed 
to pay for their feats.
To make a revenue for the faid chapel, the faid Mr.
Dawfon and the inhabitants gave 120/, and Oliver Martin efqu ire from a 
charity in his dilpofal 80/, whereby a benefaction of 200/ was procured from 
the governors of queen Anne's bounty.
Another augmentation of 200/ from 
the laid bounty came by lot.
And a third augmentation of 200/ from the 
faid bounty was procured by a benefaction of ioo/ from lady Gower, wood 
fold off from one of the purchafed eftates 28 /, and 72/ advanced by Mr. Wil- 
liam Sedgwick the prefent curate.
The whole amounting to 1000/.
Where- 
with one eftate was purchafed in Old Hutton, another in Cafterton, and an- 
other in Dent ; of the clear yearly rent in the whole of 41 / 5 s od.
V. 
MIDDLETON.
Middle-ton is bounded on the Eaft, by Dent in the parifh of Sedbergh ; on 
die South, by Barbon â– , on the Weft, by Killington, from which it is parted 
Pi

(MiddlbtonvJ 253.
by the river Lune â€¢, and on the North, by the river Rowthey, which feparates 
it from Howgill and Bland in the parifh of Sedbergh.
It is part of the ancient barony of Kendal ; and feems to have been given 
(with divers other pofleflions) by Ketel, the third baron of Kendal, to his 
younger fon Orme, father of Cofpatrick, "father of Thomas who was founder of 
Snap abbey.
The elder branch of the Talebois family enjoyed divers pcf- 
feinons in Cumberland.
And the faid Orme, having married Gunild filter of 
Waldieve firft lord of Allerdale, fon of Cofpatrick earl or Dunbar, received with 
her large poffeffions in Cumberland â€¢, and his fon Cofpatrick (lb called after the 
name of his mother's father the aforefaid earl of Dunbar) made an exchange 
of Middleton in Lonfdale, and fome manors which he had in Cartmell, with 
William de hancaftre his coufin german, for the manors of Workington and 
Lamplugh, lying contiguous to fome of his other eftates in Cumberland : Re- 
ferving to him the faid Cofpatrick and his heirs, the homage of Middleton, 
and a quit-rent of 6d yearly, or a pair of gilt fpurs * : And the faid Cofpatrick 
to difcharge the foreign fervice of him the faid William for the premiffes in 
Cumberland, due to the barony and caftle of Egremont -f-.
And the pofterity 
of this Cofpatrick have continued at Workington to this day.
Middleton having thus came back to- the elder branch of the Talebois fa- 
mily-, it feems to have been firft granted by them to the Preftons, and by the 
Preflons to others.
For amongft the fines in the 7 Ed. 1.
Richard de Preflon 
conveys to Henry de Kennet and Euphemia his wife, the manor of Middleton in 
Lonfdale.
Poffibly this might be a daughter of Preflon.
Whether this family of Kennet took afterwards the name de Middleton (as 
was not unufual in like cafes), or how otherwife the Middletons came to this 
manor, doth not appear; however, certain it is, the Middletons not long after 
were in poffefTion of this manor, in which name and family it continued for ten 
generations, and then ended in daughters.
The firft that we find was,- 
1. Thomas Middleton of Middleton-hall, in the reign of king Edward 
the third.
He had 6 children â€¢, amongft whom were 3 daughters, Agnes mar- 
ried to John Chambre, Margaret married to John Morley, and Joan married 
to John Manfergh.
2. John Middleton, fon and heir of Thomas.
He married a daughter of 
John Medcalf.
They had 6 children.
One of whom was Jeffrey Middleton?
the third fon, who was anceftor of the Middletons of Leigbton in Lancashire, 
a very eminent family, whofe male line failed near the fame time with this elder 
branch at Middleton.
Another of their children was Jacomin?
who was mar- 
ried to Richard Prefton.
3. Thomas Middleton, fon and heir of John, married Mabel daughter of 
Sir Richard Mufgrave of Hartley caftle, in the reign of king Henry the fixth.
* This refervation of a pair of gilt fpurs in many ancient grants had a particular meaning, be- 
caufe they were peculiarly ufeful to the grantor ; every knight (who ferved on horfeback) being 
obliged to wear gilt fpurs : hence they were called equites aurati.
f So fays Mr. Denton.
But fome of the pedigrees of the Curvven family fay, that Orme him- 
fclf made this exchange.

They had 13 children ; amongft whom were, Elizabeth, married to Thomas

4. Thomas Middleton, fon and heir of Thomas, married Margaret 
daughter of Roger Lafcells j and by her had nine children, of whom the 
eldeit was, w 
5. Geoffrey Middleton, who married Margaret daughter of George 
JCirkham of Northamptonfhire.
And to his fecond wife he married a daugh- 
ther of Kirkby in Lancafhire.
With this Geoffrey begins the pedigree confirmed by Sir William Dugdale 
at his vifitation in 1664.
Neverthelefs, the above account (which is taken 
from a pedigree in 1628), fo far as we can judge from the intermarriages with 
Mufgrave, Ducket, Redman, and Bellingham, feems to be fufficiently au- 
thentic.
This Geoffrey was .knighted by king Henry the eighth j and was major 
general jn that king's expedition to Bulloign.
Befides his eldeit fon John, he had a fon Thomas Middleton of Applegarth ; 
upon whom William Par, marquis of Northampton beftowed that tenement 
for his faithful fervice.
The faid Thomas married Katherine fourth daughter 
of William Conyers of Marfke efquire, who was buried in the church at 
Marfke in the year .1569 ; as appears from her epitaph there, fetting forth the 
above particulars.
He had alio one daughter, which daughter was married to 
Anthony Fleming of Rydal efquire.
6. John Middleton, fon and heir of Sir Jeoffrey.
He married Anne daugh- 
ter of Tunftal of Thurland-caftle in Lancashire ; and by her had eight chil- 
dren.
Amongft whom was Frances married to Richard Lowther of JLowther 
efquire ; and another daughter married to Lancafter of Sockbridge.
7. Edward Middleton, fecond fon and heir of John (for Chriftopher 
the eldeft died before his father without iflue).
He married Mary daughter 
of Sir Thomas Carus knighr, one of the juftices of the court of king's bench j 
and by her had iffue eight children.
He died about the year 1599.
8. John Mjddleton, fon and heir of Edward, married Jane daughter of 
Thomas Afhton of Crofton in Lancafhire efquire.
They had fix ions ; and 
one daughter, which daughter was married to one Alexander in the county of 
Chefter.
The fons were (1) Edward.
(2) Thomas, who died without iflue.
(3) Job* 1 * w ho was major general in the king's fervice, and was flain at die 
battle of Hopton-heath in 1642.
(4) William, who was colonel of horfe and 
foot in the faid king's fervice.
This William married Dorothy Moore of 
Middleton, and by her hn] eight fons and four daughters, all living at the

(5) Richard, flain in the civil wars 
in the faid king's fervjee.
(6) Chrijlophcr, flain alio righting in the faid king's

9. Edward Middlit< n, fon and heir of John, by his wife Jane Afhton.
I le married Bridget daughter and heir of Robert Byndloie of BorwLk-hall in '

He died juft about the beginning of the civil wars.
For by

it is found, that Edward Middleton efquire 
died leifed of the manor and demefne of Middleton, with one capital mefluage 
called Middleton-hall, and one water corn miln, which he held of the king 
as of his caftle of Kendal called Marquis fee, in free focage, by fealty and the 
free rent of 26s 8 d ; and that John Middleton is his fon and heir, aged 1,9 
years and 6 months.
And the faid Edward had no other child.
10.
John Middleton, fon and heir of Edward.
He married Mary Cole 
of Coat near Halton in Lancafhire; and was of the age of 42 at Dugdale's 
vifitation aforefaid in 1664; and had iflue then five children, Edward, David?., 
Robert> Bridget, and Mary.
The three fons died without iflue â€¢, and the inheritance defcended to the 
two daughters.
And here ended the direct male line of the Middletons oÂ£ 
Middleton-hall.
The arms of Middleton were j Argent, a faltier ingrailed Sable.
Of the two daughters ; Bridget, the elder, was married to Jofhua Heble- 
thwaite of Dent,' and to him had live children, John, Edward, Jofhua, Bridget 
and Agnes.
Of the three fons there are no defcendents remaining.
Bridget 
was married to Thomas Fawcet father of the prefent James Fawcet of Kirkby 
Stephen attorney at law.
And Agnes was married to John Fawcet, brother 
of the faid Thomas, who hath feveral children now living.
The other daughter Mary was married to James Cragg of Dent, and had 
eight children, John, James, David, Agnes, Mary, Rebecca, Bridget, and 
Ifabel.
Of this branch alfo there is no iflue male remaining of the name of 
Crag.
Mary, the fecond daughter of James Cragg, was married to Giles 
Moore of Grimefhill efquire ; and to him had iflue John, James rector of 
Tatham, Agnes, George, Mary married to Edward Johnfon of Old Hall 
efquire, and Giles.
Part of the demefne remains to John Moore efquire eldeft fon of Giles 
aforefaid â€¢, the hall, the manor, and the remaining part of the demefne, were 
fold to one Benjamin Middleton (who doth not appear to have been of kin- 
dred to this family), whofe fon Adolphus Middleton fold the fame to Dr. Adam 
Afkew of Newcaftle upon Tyne, fon of Dr. Anthony Afkew of Kendal, and 
father of Dr. Anthony Afkew of London, all three very eminent and able 
phyficians.
This family of Afkew (Afajkeugh, which word fignifies an hilly ground 
covered with oaks) was of long continuance in the county of Cumberland, 
deriving their defcent from Tkurjion de Bcfco (a name of the fame import,.
bofcus lignifying a wood), who lived in the reign of king John, and had feoff- 
ment from the Boyvills, lords of Kirkfanton, of a place there called Aik- 
fkeugh, within the lordfhip of Milium ; whence his pofterity, according to 
the cuflom of thofe early ages, have afiumed their furname.
For feveral generations this family refided at Graymains in the parifh of 
Moncafter and county aforefaid.
Of which family Was Sir Hugh Afkew, to 
whom king Henry the eighth, in the 33d year of his reign, gave Seaton in the 
faid lordfhip of Milium, which had been an houfe of Benedictine nuns.

Of which Sir Hugh, there is a curious anecdote in a rnanufcript account of 
Cumberland (a copy of which is in the fixth volume of Mr. Machel's col- 
lection) written by Mr. Edmund Sandford a gentleman of the houfe of Afk- 
ham.
Speaking of Moncafter and the country thereabouts, he fays, " Four 
" miles fouthward Hands Seaton, an eftate of 500.' a year, fometime a reli- 
Â«* gious houfe, got by one Sir Hugh Afkew yeoman of the cellar to queen 
"- Katherine in Henry the eighth's time, and born in this country.
And 
" when that queen was divorced from her hufband, this yeoman was deftitute.
Â«' And he applied himfelf for help to the lord chamberlain for fome place or 
" other in the king's fervice.
The lord chamberlain knew him well, becaule 
" he had helped him to a cup of the beft, but told him he had no place for 
â€¢" him but that of a charcoal carrier.
Well, quoth Afkew, help me in with 
" one foot, let me get in the other as I can.
And upon a great holiday, the 
" king looking out at fome fports, Afkew got a courtier, a friend of his, to 
" Hand befide the king -, and he got on his velvet cafibck and his gold chain, 
" and a bafket of charcoal on his back, and marched in the king's fight with 
" it.
O, fays the king, now I like yonder fellow well that difdains not to do 
" his dircy office in his dainty cloaths â€¢, what is he ?
Says his friend that flood 
" by on purpofe â€¢, it is Mr. Afkew that was yeoman of the cellar to the late 
" queen's majefly, and is now glad of this poor place, to keep him in your 
** majefly's fervice, which he will not forfake for all the world.
The king 
*' fays, 1 had the befl wine when he was in the cellar : he is a gallant wine 
" tafter : let him have his place again.
He afterwards knighted him, and 
â€¢" gave unto him Seaton.
At laft he fold his place, and came to Seaton, and 
*' married the daughter of Sir John Huddlefton, and fettled this Seaton upon 
lc her.
And fhe afterwards married Mr. Pennington lord of the manor of 
* c Moncafter, and had a fbn Jofeph, and a younger fon William Pennington, 
f* to whom fhe gave Seaton." 
Of this fame Hugh, Mr. Denton alio, in his manufcript hiftory of Cumber- 
land, makes honourable mention â€¢, where, fpeaking of the faid nunnery of 
Seaton or Lekeley, he fays, " When by the fuppreffion of abbies it came to 
" the crown, king Henry the eighth gave the fite and lands there to his fer- 
" vant Sir Hugh Afkew, who was descended from Thurflon de Bofco, and 
" was raifed to great honour and preferment by his fervice to the faid king 
64 in his houfe ordinary, and in the field at the fiege of Bologne and wars of 
." France." 
He feems to.
have continued in his office of yeoman of the cellar to queen 
Anne Boleyn, and afterwards to king Edward the fixth.
In the firft year of Edward the fixth, he ferved in the expedition againft 
Scotland under Edward duke of Somerier, and for his bravery and condqft at 
the battle of MufTelborough was created knight banneret under the royal 
ftandard in the camp of Roquefborough*.
In the 3d year of queen Elizabeth he was fheriff of Cumberland ; and in

Middleton hall is an old caftle-like building, and is now made ufe of only as

There was anciently a chapel in it, but that went to decay 
many years ago.
When Mr. Machel made his furvey in the year 1692, the 
arms in the hall were then fo much defaced, that he could only make out 
one fingle coat, which was an impaling of Middleton and Lowther.

The tenants purchafed their eftates to freehold at different times, moft of 
them of 'John Middleton in the reigns of queen Elizabeth and king James the 
firft.
Next to the hall, the moft confiderable place in Middleton is Grime/hill, be- 
longing to John Moore efquire aforefaid ; a gentleman of moft refpectable cha- 
racter, as an active, able, and uncorrupt magiftrate, a zealous and fincere 
friend, a promoter of piety and virtue by his own example and encourage- 
ment thereof in others, and an abhorrer of every thing that is vicious, mean, 
fcandalous, or difhonourable.
His father Giles Moore efquire, by the mere force of genius and application, 
without the help of an univerfity education, was profoundly learned, not only 
in the hiftory and antiquities of our own country, but in the ancient Grecian 
and Roman literature, and was critically (killed even in the Hebrew language.
The next remarkable place, after Grime/hill, is Hawkin-hall ; which was 
built by Dr. Chrijlopher Bainbridge mafter of Chrift's college in Cambridge in 
the reign of king Charles the firft.
It is a pretty large houfe, and yet is fo 
contrived, that it hath but one pair of principles.
Dr. Bainbridge was born 
at this places an d married at 60 years of age, and by his wife had 19 
children.
At Beclfide-hall in this townfhip was born Sir John Otway knight, an emi- 
nent counsellor at law.
He was admitted fellow of St. John's college in Cam- 
bridge in the year 1635; and was amongft the firft of thofe that were ejected 
by the earl of Manchester in 1643.
After his removal from the univerfity, he 
became one of the readers in Gray's Inn. He was greatly inftrumental in 
bringing over to the royal caufe two officers who commanded each a regiment 
under Cromwell, viz.
colonel Redman who married Mr. Otway's fifter, and 
colonel Clobery who married his wife's fifter.
On king Charles the fecond's 
return, he was knighted and made one of the king's counfel, vicechancellor 
of the dutchy of Lancafter, and chancellor of the county palatine of Dur- 
ham.
He acquired a confiderable eftate, and fettled at Ingmire hall, nigh 
unto his own paternal eftate, but fituate in the edge of Yorkfhire, in the parifh 
of Sedbergh.
His dependents were as follows : 
1. The faid Sir John Otway married firft Mary Rigg of Winchefter, and by 
her had iflue (1) John, who died unmarried.
(2) Charles Otway, LL.
D rmny 
years fellow of the aforefaid college, where he died in 1621.
(3) Anne, mar- 
ried into Ireland.
(4) Mary, married to Pofthumus Wharton of Sedbergh 
clerk, to whom fhe had iflue Mary married to John Cawthorne efquire, and 
Margaret married to Samuel Saunders of Sedbergh, D.

To his fecond wife he married Llizabeth daughter of John Braithwaite and 
niece and heirefs of Thomas Brathwaite of Amblefide gentleman, and by her 
had ifiue, (1) Brath-waite.
(2) Elizabeth, married to By ram.

He died at Ingmire-hall in 1693, and was interred in the parifh church of 
Sedbergh ; where, on a marble monument, is the following iufcription :

Vicechancellor of the dutchy of Lancafter, 
and chancellor of the county palatine of Durham, 
late one of the readers of Gray's Inn,

2. Brathwaite Otway of Ingmire-hall efquire, only furviving fon of Sir John 
Oiway, was fometime fellow- commoner of the aforefaid college, and after- 
wards a ftudent in Gray's Inn. In his time a difpute happened between Tho- 
mas Strickland efquire lord of the manor, and the tenants of Sedbergh, which 
caufe he took up in behalf of the tenants, and managed at his own expence ; 
as appears from the following infcription upon a brafs plate in the church, 
which the tenants put up in his life-time, but without his knowledge : 
" In the year 1744.
* Gratitude obliged the parifhioners of Sedbergh to erect this monument, in

* Angular humanity, beneficence, and integrity, ought never to be forgotten.
â€¢' When Bluecafier was inclofed, with an intent to take it from them, and 
" many impofitions took place-, he voluntarily defended their caufe at his own

The chapel of Middleton was built by the inhabitants in the year 1634, 
upon ground given by the aforefaid Dr. Bainbridge, who alfo gave 40 s to-

It was confecrated by bifhop Bridgman in the year fol- 
lowing, by the name of the Chapel of the Holy Ghoft, referving to the bifhop 
of Chefter the nomination of a preaching minifter, and is fynodals, and is \d

It was made parochial by bifhop Pearlbn in 1671.
The 
chapel-yard was inlarged by land given to Giles Moore of Grimefhill efquire, 
and in 1712 a licence was obtained to bury therein.
The revenue thereof

Afterwards 200/ came to this chapel by lot, with which and 
with divers benefactions called chapel ftock, an eftate was purchafed in Middle- 
ton of the yearly value of 12/.
In the year 1756, the executors of the late 
Dr. Stratford gave 10Â©/, the prefent curate Mr. Garnet and the inhabitants 
gave other 100/, whereby an augmentation of 2C0/ was procured from the

KILLINGTON AND FIRBANK.
Killington and Firbank were anciently one manor.
The latter was not 
fo called as having heretofore been planted with fir trees ; for the ancient name 
of k univerfally was Frithbank, from the Saxon frith or frid which fignifies 
â– peace, and is transferred to places inclofed which are free from annoyance or 
purprefture, and are kept clear from cattle at certain feafons of the year : of 
which fort is a dinted pafture, where feveral perfons have cattle-gaits -, and 
the perfon who looks after the pafture and flint is to this day called the frith* 
man.
The river Lnne is the Eaftern boundary of both thefe divifions.
Killington 
adjoins on the fouth to the other parts of Kirkby Lonfdale parifh.
On the 
well of Killington, lies Old Hutton ; and on the weft of Firbank lies Lamb- 
rigg.
And the northern boundary of Firbank is Dillaker.
There are between 30 and 40 families in each of thefe divifions, all free- 
hold -, the manor having been purchafed from the mefne lords by the tenants, 
who therefore hold immediately of the crown as of the marquis fee by the 
yearly free rent (jointly) of 6s 8d, as found by inquifition 28 Cha. 2.
In the reign of king Edward the firft, we find one William de Frithbank a 
juror on feveral inquifitions pojl mortem of the Talebois family : But the ma- 
nor at the fame time was in the name and family of Pickering.
I. The firft of the name of Pickering that came to Killington, was Wil- 
liam de Pykeringe fon of Thomas^ in the reign of king Henry the third.
For in the 44th year of that king, Peter de Brus the third grants to William de 
Pykeringe the manor of Killington : To hold to the faid William and his heirs, 
and to his afiigns (except Jews and religious perfons), of him the faid Peter 
and his heirs in fee, with all the game * thereof, and other appurtenances 
whatfeever.
Saving to him the faid Peter, during his life, freedom of chafe 
for himfelf or his men, at their pleafure, within the boundaries of the faid 
manor ; yet fo, that neither he nor any for him fhall have entry into the in- 
clofed grounds to make chafe.
Rendering for the fame yearly a pair of gilt 
fpurs, or fixpence, at the Feaft of Pentecoft ; and doing fervice of the 20th 
part of one knight's fee when occafion fhall be, for all fervices, fuits of courj:, 
* Cum omnium fal'vaglna : â€” Salvaginus catus, in fome eld writings, fignifies a favage or wild 
cat.
From the circumflances of this grant it feemeth, that the word Jal c vagina here is to be under- 
ftcod of the beafis fit for hunting, as deer, hares, marterns, foxes, and in general all the wild 
beads of the foreit, 
and

(Killington, &c.) 
and other cuftoms.
He grants moreover to the faid William, his heirs and 
afligns, that they {hall have the fame liberty in purfuing the game out of the 
boundaries of Killington, as far as the limits of that part of the foreft of the Hay, 
which belongs to Walter de Lindefay, and in driving back the fame with their 
men and dogs, which he the faid Peter himfelf had : So nevertheless, that 
they fhall claim no fuch liberty in the faid Peter's part of the foreft of the Hay.
Witneffes whereof were, John de Burton knighr, Gilbert deBereburne, Tho- 
mas de Lancaflre, Ralph de Patton, Nicolas de Ninefergh, Thomas de Der- 
lay, Richard de Crok, and others *.
II.
Thomas de Pickering, fon of William.
â€” By a charter in the 32 Ed. 1.
the king grants to Thomas de Pickeringe free warren in all his demefne lands of 
Killington and Millehope in the county of Weftmorland ; fo as thofe lands be 
not within the limits of the king's foreft.
So that no perfon fhall enter thofe 
lands to make chafe therein, or take any thing which belongs to the warren, 
without the licence and will of the faid Thomas and his heirs, on pain of for- 
feiture of 10 /.
to the king.
Witneffes whereof; the reverend father W.
bifhop 
of Coventry and Litchfield, Henry de Lacy earl of Lincoln, Henry de Percye, 
Hugh de Veer, William de Vavafor, and others -f-.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
after the death of Wiliiam de Roos, the inquifition finds, 
that Thomas de Pykeringe held the hamlet of Kyllington, Frethebank and the 
Berghes, by the fervice of the tenth part of one knight's fee, and the rent of 
9 s yearly.
â€” And the faid Thomas was one of the jurors in taking the faid in- 
quifition, and is flyled Thomas de Pykeringe knight.
King Edward the third, in the 10th year of his reign, confirms to Thomas de 
Pykeringe fon of William de Pykering, the manor of Killington ; for the fine 
of 40 s paid into the exchequer J.
III.
The next that we meet with was James Pickering ; who in the 36th 
and again in the 39th of Ed. 3.
was knight of the mire for Weft morland.
This James, in the 38 Ed. 3.
granted by fine to Richard Carus and Agnes 
his wife certain lands in Kirkby, Helfington, and Stirkland : To hold to them 
and the heirs of their bodies ; and in defect thereof, to revert.
So that this 
was probably a fettlement on the marriage of his daughter.
, 
Six years after this, Richard de Wifbitche conveys to Alexander fon of Alice 
de Pickering a moiety of the manor of Prerton Patrick, with a reverfion to the 
faid Richard in fee.
â€” This Alice poflibly might be widow of the faid James ; 
. and this conveyance, a fettlement on the marriage of her younger fon.
IV.
Sir John Pickering of Killington knight, married Elianor daughter of 
Sir Richard Harrington; and by her had iffue, 1.
James.
2. Margaret, mar- 
ried to Robert de Roos knight.
And another daughter who was a nun at 
Watton.
V. Sir James Pickering knight, in the 1 Ric. 2.
and again in the 2d and 
6th years of the fame king, was chofen knight of the {hire for Weftmorland.
He married to his firft wife, Mary daughter of Sir Robert Lowther of Low-

Sir Edward had a fon Edward who died without iffue.
VI.
Sir James Pickering knight, fon and heir of Sir James by his wife 
Mary Lowther, married Margaret daughter and heir of Laffels of Efkrigg ; 
and had iffue James and John.
VII.
Sir James Pickering knight, married Anne daughter and heir of 
Sir Chriftopher Morefby of the county of Cumberland knight-, and by her 
had fix children; 1.
Anne, married to Sir Robert Bellingham of Burnefhead 
knight.
2. Chriftopher, his eldeft fon and heir.
3. Margaret, married to Sir 
William Stapleton knight.
4. Thomas, who had a fon Thomas that married 
Margaret daughter of Nicolas Starkey.
5. James, who married Elizabeth 
one of the three daughters and coheirs of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld of Threlkeld 
by his wife the baronefs Vcky widow of John lord Clifford.
6. William, who 
married Winifred another of the faid daughters and coheirs.
VIII.
Sir Christopher Pickering knight, by his wife, whofe name was 
Elizabeth, had an only child Anne, who was heir both to the Pickering and 
Morefby eftates.
She was thrice married : Firft, to Sir Francis Weftby, upon 
whofe ifiue by that marriage the Cumberland eftates feem to have been fettled.
Her fecond hufband was Sir Henry Knevitt of Eaft Horfeley in the county of 
Surrey : To whom fhe feemeth to have had no iffue : He appears to have been 
dead in the 6 Eliz.
For in that year there was a prefentation to the church of 
Afby by virtue of a title derived from her (as heirefs of Morefby) by the 
name and title of the lady Anne Knevet widow of Sir Henry Knevet.
Nine 
years after this, there was a prefentation to the fame church by John Vaughan 
of Efkrigg in the county of York efquire and the lady Anne his wife.
This 
John Vaughan was her third hufband, and to him it is probable fhe had iffue.
For the perfon who fold the manors of Killington and Firbank to the tenants 
was Francis Vaughan in all likelihood her fon.
This Francis Vaughan, fly led Francis Vaughan of Sutton upon Derwen in 
the county of York efquire, in the 27 Eliz.
conveyed the faid manors to 
truftees for the ufe of the tenants ; which truftees conveyed to every of the 
tenants their own tenements, with a proportionable part or portion of the 
moors, waftes, common of pafture, perquifites, and profits of courts, and of 
all other privileges, liberties, and franchifes, parcel of or belonging to the 
faid manors, according to their then annual rent; and to every individual, the 
wood growing upon his own tenement.
â€” The king, as paramount, claims waif 
and ftray within the refpective liberties ; and they pay to the leffee of the 
crown the ancient quit rent of 6s Sd, which comes nearly to the fum of one 
penny for each houfe.
What became of the further dependents of the lady Anne, we have no par- 
ticular account.

Mr. Ajht on in the 15 Ja. 1.
fold the premifes to Thomas 
Kitfonoi Warton in Lancashire gentleman; on whole death in the 15 Cha. 1.
the inquifition finds, that he died feifed of one capital mefluage called Kil- 
lington hall, and the demefne thereof, and one other mefluage and tenement, 
and one water corn mill in Killingron, late purchafed of the heir of Chrifto- 
pher Pickering knight, holden of the king as of his manor of Kirkby in 
Kendale, late called the Marquis fee, by the 60th part of one knight's fee: 
his fon and heir Thomas being of full age.- 
Which Thomas the fon died without ifllie.
And the eftate came to his fiftcr 
Elizabeth, who was married to Robert Hebletbwaite ; who had a fon Thomas 
Heblethwaite efquire, who devifed the fame to truftees to be fold, and the fame 
was accordingly purchafed by Jacob Morland of Caplethwaite efquire, whofe 
grandfon Jacob Morland efquire now enjoys the fame.
There is * park belonging to the hall, which anciently had deer in it; but 
none, probably, after the death of Sir Chrijlopher Pickering, the laft.
refident of 
the family there.
Thefe two divifions had originally but one chapel; which flood in a clofe 
called Chapelgarth; adjoining to which are two clofes called Piieft fields, ly- 
ing in Killington.
And both the divifions jointly paid a chapel falary ; which 
feems to have been the ufual limited fum of 20 nobles: for now when the 
falary is divided between the two chapels, Firbank chapel has appropriated to 
it near half that fum : the ancient chapel falary indeed of Killington is larger, 
but that feems to have been bv reafon of an addition made to it on eftablifh- 
ing a feparate chapel in Killington.
In or about the year 1585, on the petition of the inhabitants of Killington 
and Frithbank to bifhop Chadderton, fetting forth, that by reafon of their 
diftance from the parifti church (fome of them being diftant ten miles and 
none lefs than fix), and by reafon of inundations and of ftorms frequently 
raging in thofe parts in the winter feafon, they cannot carry their dead to be 
buried without great trouble and inconvenience, nor their children to be bap- 
tized without great peril both of foul and body, nor refort thitherto hear di- 
vine fervice and receive the facraments as becometh chriftians and by right 
they are bounden: He the faid bifhop, in confideration of the premises, grants 
unto them his faculty and licence, that in the chapel fituate within the ter- 
ritory, hamlet, or lordfhip of Killington and Frithbank aforefaid, commonly 
called Killington chapel, by a minifter or curate lawfully ordained, or fuffici- 
ently approved from time to time, to be hired at the cofls and charges of the

gave a rent-charge of 40s out of the faid eftate at Bendrigg.
And there is 
another eftate in Firbank belonging to the poor of Killington, now let for 
11/ 10 j, and it is not known who was the donor (probably it was purchafed 
with fome ancient poor itock).
Alfo there is afcbool ftock of 65 /; whereof 40/ was given by the faid Tho- 
mas Heblethwaite efquire, 5/ by the faid Jacob Morland efquire, and 20/ by 
Thomas Sharpe.
The ancient chapel falary of Firbank is nine nobles or 3/.
Anthony Ward 
of Whinny How gave an eftate called Green in Lambrigg then of the yearly 
value of 8 /, and alfo the fum of 50/ in money, in confideration whereof the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty gave 200/.
Alfo 200/ came twice by lot 
to this chapel.
With all which fums lands were purchafed in Firbank, Strick- 
land Roger, and Strickland Ketel.
And the whole revenue of this chapel at

OF THE BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
TLTAVING finifhed the barony of Kendal, which is one of the two great ba- 
ronies of which the county of Weflmorland doth confift â€¢, we now proceed 
to the other, which is emphatically ftyled the barony of Weflmorland, confiding 
of the honours or feignories of Appleby and Burgh, which contain under 
them all the fubordinate manors holden of the lords of Weftmorhnd, and in- 
deed all that feems anciently to have been deemed within the county of Weft- 
morland-, the barony of Kendal (as we obferved before) being confidered as 
part of Lancafhire and Yorkfhire, and in Domefday furvey inierted under the 
title Agemundreneffe .
In order to deduce the hiftory of this barony, it is neceffary to obferve in 
the firft place, that in the diftribution of the provinces by William the con- 
queror, the earldom of Chester was granted to Hugh de Abrinois furnamed 
Lupus, fon of a filler of the faid William, whofe hufband's name was Richard 
Vol. I.
M m vifcount 
266 BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
vifcount of Aurenches furnamed Gcz. This Hugh received the appellation of 
Lupus probably from his martial fpirit, and for the fame reafon was appointed 
to that important ftation againft the Britons then driven into Wales.
And the 
king granted him a fort of royal power, tenere ita libere adgladium, Jicut ipfe rex 
tenebat Angliam per coronam *.
Where we may obferve, by the way, the deli- 
cacy of expreffion : the conqueror did not chufe to affirm exprefsly that he 
held the kingdom by the right of conqueft, but rather fpeaks in ambiguity 
and with referve ; but the meaning could be no other, than to hold the earl- 
dom by the Two rd, as he himfelf held the kingdom.
At the fame time, the county of Cumberland, and fo much of Weftmor- 
land as was not included within the barony of Kendal, were granted to Ra- 
nulph de Mefchiens another Norman ; who, in the year 1088, granted the two 
churches of St. Michael and St. Laurence of his cattle of Appleby, to the 
abbey of St. Mary's York f.
The faid Ranulph de Mefchiens married Lucia fitter of Hugh Lupus aforefaid, 
by whom he had ifTue a fon and daughter.
The fon, Ranulph de Mefchiens, 
fo called after his father's name, fucceeded to the Cumberland and Weftmor- 
land eftates (except what his father had before granted away to his brother 
William de Mefchiens and others) ; and afterwards, upon the death of Richard 
brother of the faid Hugh Lupus, the faid Ranulph the fon was, in his mother's 
right, being next heir in blood, and by the favour of the king, made earl of 
Chefter.
For the king propofing to him to make war upon the marchers in 
Chelnire, who had invaded a great part of that country, he undertook the 
charge, and drove them out.
Whereupon the king gave him all that pro- 
vince, and made him count palatine of it, as he had made the earl Hugh be- 
fore.
And having obtained of the king to confirm the grants that he had 
made in Cumberland, he thenceforth left that earldom, and fettled himfelf in 
Chefhire J.
Whereupon the eftates which he left behind him in Cumberland and Wefc- 
morland, came by his appointment and difpofition to his fifcer, who was mar- 
ried to (another Norman) Robert d'Eftrivers, or Trevers.
This Robert de Trevers had a daughter and heir Ibria Trevers, who was mar- 
ried to Ranulph Engain-, who had a fon and heir William Engain; who had a 
daughter and heir Ada Engain, married to Simon de Morville (who alfo was of 
Norman extraction).
The faid Simon de Morville had a fon and heir Roger de Morville ; wh'o had a 
fon and heir Hugh de Morville, and a daughter Maud married to William de 
Veteripont father of Robert de Veteripont whom we fhall often have occafion to 
mention in the fequel, with whom the faid William de Veteripont had that part

I of 
BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
267 
of Meburn in Weftmorland, which from her flill bears the name of Mauld's 
Meburn (Meburn Matildas).
This fame Hugh de Morville was one of the four knights that affaiTinated 
Thomas a Becket archbifhop of Canterbury in the reign of king Henry the 
fecond.
Whereupon the faid Hugh's estates in Westmorland were feized into 
the king's hands-, as appears by an inquifnion taken at York in the 3 Ed. 1.
whereby it is found (inter alia) that the caitles of Apelby and of Burgh under 
Stanemore were feized into the king's hands, by reafon of the trefpafs com- 
mitted (propter tranfgreffwnem faffim) by Hugh de Morville.
After this forfeiture, it feemeth that the faid king Henry the fecond granted 
the custody of Appleby castle to Gofpatric fon of Orme-, for amongtt the fines 
in the exchequer in the 22 Hen. 2, it appears, that Gofpatric fon of Orme was 
fined 500 marks, becaufe he delivered the castle of Appleby to the king of 
Scors ; Ralph de Cundale for the fame fact was fined 40 marks; Odard de 
Burgham 20 marks ; John de Morevil 10/; Gilbert de Engaine 5/; and 
others other fums.
This family of Gofpatric had very confiderable poiTeftions, not only in Cum- 
berland, but alio in Westmorland.
Ormes-head nigh Appleby had probably 
its name from them.
Thomas Ion of this Gofpatric fon of Orme was founder 
of Shap abbey ; and Thomas fon of this Thomas confirmed his father's grants.
Neverthelefs the barony of Westmorland and custody of the castles was not 
granted to them in fee â€¢, for by the faid inquisition in the 3 Ed. 1.
it is found, 
that after the forfeiture thereof by Sir Hugh de Morville^ they continued in the 
hands of the crown, till t king John granted the fame to Robert de Veteri- 
pont before mentioned.
The faid Robert de Veteripont was a defcendent of a family in Nor- 
mandy (de Veteri Ponte) lords of Curvaville.
His father's name was William 
de Veteripont, and his mother was Maud filter of Sir Hugh Morville aforefaid.
King John, in the 4th year of his reign, granted to this Robert the custody 
(as probably he had granted to Gofpatric before) of Apelby and Burgh, and 
alfo the fheriffwick of Westmorland, to hold during the king's pleafure.
In the very next year, the faid king granted to him in perpetuity, as follows: 
viz.
" Appleby and Burgh, with all their -appendages, with the fheriffwick 
" and rent of our county of Westmorland, and the fervices of all our tenants 
*' who hold not by knights fervice ; to hold of us and our heirs to him the faid 
*' Robert and his heirs by his efpoufed wife, by the fervice of four knights 
M fees.
Saving to us and our heirs our pleas of the crown, and royal dignity.
" And faving that the faid Robert or his men ftiall not commit waste in the 
" woods of Whinfell, and that his fervants (hall not hunt there during our life 
" without the bodily prefence of the faid Robert *."

2 68 BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
(Vet smponts.) 
And becaufe much depends upon this charter, it is thought fit here to fub- 
join Sir Matthew Hale's learned comment thereon.
Appleby and Burgh] Thefe are all the particulars that are mentioned in this 
charter, and thefe only barely Appleby and Burgh, and not the caftle, manor, 
or the like-,, but they include the fame, and indeed all the reft of the barony 
of Westmorland.
With all their appendages'] Thefe words carry, firft, the feveral parts of 
thefe caftles and manors, which are particularly Specified in the inquifitionsr 
after the death of the feveral poffeffors â€¢, as Langton, Brougham, Kirkby 
Thore, Kirkby Stephen, Winton, Mallerftang, and the reft : all of them 
being appendant either to Appleby or Burgh, and both together making up 
the barony of Weftmorland.
The words carry alfo the franchifes to the fame 
belonging, that are appendant to the fame by prefcription â€¢, as liberties of free 
chafe, free warren, affizes of weights and meafures, of bread and beer, and 
fuch like.
â€” And befides thefe ordinary tenures and fervices, we find in the 
records mention of three kinds of rents and tenures, which the fouthern parts 
of England are not acquainted with: I.
White farms of the tenants; but this 
feems to be their ordinary rents.
2. A fervice called cornage, paid by the 
knights and free tenants; which drew wardfhip and relief.
3. A fervice or 
tenure called drengage ; which was not a knight's fervice, yet it drew wardfhip 
and relief.
With the fheriffwick and rent of the county of Weftmorland] This paffed the 
fheriffwick, which was parcel of the barony of Weftmorland.
And whereas 
this whole barony was held by four knights fees, the fheriffwick was eftimated 
at one.
With the fervices of all our tenants there, who hold not by knights fervice] By 
the general words, knights fees would have paffed, if they had not been par- 
ticularly excepted.
But here they are excepted, and no knights fervice tenure 
paffed, though other tenure which had relation to the wars and had the fame 
effect with knighrs fervice as to the point of wardfhip did pafs, namely, cornage.
And in propriety, none were in thofe times accounted tenants by knights fer- 
vice, but fuch as held by a knight's fee or part thereof.
To him and his heirs by his wife] This at common law was a fee fimple con- 
ditional.
So that before iffue had, the donee by his alienation might bar his 
ifTue ; and by his alienation after iffue had, might bar the donor.
If no aliena- 
tion was made mefne between the grant and the 13 Ed. 1.

fee fimple, by the ftatute Be Bonis made in that year, turned into an eftate 
tail, and a reverfion fettled in the crown.
But if there were an alienation 
mcfne, then the faid ftatute works not this into an eftate tail.
But this con- 
tinued unaltered â€¢, and therefore by the ftatute aforefaid is turned into an eftate 
tail, with the reverfion in the crown.
By the fer vice of four knights fees'] And accordingly was this fervice an- 
fwered by the faid Robert and his fucceffors.
And it is to be noted, that the 
barony always accompanied the poffefilons, and they were never fevered, and 
relief was anfwered for it accordingly.
Yet the charter is not to hold per ba- 
roniam, but only per quatuor milites.
So that it is not neceffary, that a barony 
by tenure be held per baroniam.
But if a large poffeffion be granted to be held 
by an honourable perfon, this intitled him in thofe ancient times to a particu- 
lar fummons to parliament as one of the bar ones regni.
Saving our pleas of the crown] This, if it had not been provided for cx'- 
prefsly in this charter, had been provided for before by the Great Charter, 
ch.
17.
" Nullus vicecomes, vel alii ballivi noftri, teneant placita cororue 
" noftri." 
And our royal dignity'] This alfo was no more than the law had faid, had 
this, faving been omitted.
And therefore as incident to this royal dignity, the 
kings placed conftables in the caftles, and had a fuperintendency over their 
judicate proceedings.
So, in the 19 Ed. 2.
we find a writ directed, " Ths 
" king, to his conftable of his caftle of Appleby." 
Shall not commit wajle in the woods of Whinfell] This imports two things, 
1. That the woods did pafs â€¢, which afterwards came to be called the foreft of 
Whinfell, as alfo in like manner the forejl of Mallerftang.
Thefe neverthelefs, 
m the hands of fubjects the patentees, are in right not forefts, but only chafes.
2. That here is a fpecial exception, reftraining the liberty of the grantee from 
what he might otherwife have done.
And here we fee the wifdom and care of 
the ancient times, in preferving of timber.
And indeed the prefervation of 
forefts, and the game of deer, was principally in order to the prefervation of 
timber, which by inclofure (though otherwife more profitable) would have 
been moie fubjeel to destruction.
So much concerning the charter.
This Robert de Veteripont was a man of great parts and employments.
He was trufted with the cuftody and difpofal of much of the king's treafure.
He was intruded with the cuftody of the prifoners taken in the wars in 
France; as appears by the feveral writs for their deliverances upon feveral 
occafions.
He was trufted with the education and cuftody of the king's niece, daugh- 
ter of William Longfpee ; as alio of the king's fon Richard, who was after- 
wards earl of Cornwall.
He was employed in offices of great truft and importance ; was fherifi of 
Caen in Normandy â€¢, was eleven times fheriff of feveral counties in England, 
as appears by the pipe rolls of thofe times.
He was employed to publifh the treaties at Winchefter, between the king on â–  
the one hand, and the pope and clergy on the other.
Ha 
2 7 o BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
(Veteriponts.) 
He had the cuftody of many caftles and towns of note at different times ; as 
namely, Windfor, Bowes, Salisbury, Carlifie, and divers others.
He was juftice in eyre, and fate in commiffion with Martin de Patifhull and 
others.
He purchafed of Maud daughter of Torphin, and of Philip de Burgo, their 
lands in Weftmorland.
He purchafed of Walter Morvil divers lands at Brampton and elfewhere.
He purchafed of Adam fon of Waldeve the advowfon of Kirkby Thore, 
together with the chapels of Sourby and Milburn.
He purchafed of Nicholas Stutevill all the lands of the faid Nicholas in Weft- 
morland; and, amongft the reft, Milburn Grange, which he gave to the abbey 
of Snap, together with the tithes of ail his mills in Wefcmorland, and the tithes 
of the renewal of all the beafls taken by him or his men in all his forefts in 
Weftmorland.
And he confirmed unto the faid abbey the grants which had been made to 
the faid abbey by Thomas fon of Gofpatric and Thomas his fon â€¢, and the grant 
of Renegill which had been made to the faid abbey by Maud his mother and 
Ivo his brother.
He was one of thofe, who in the reign of king Henry the third took the 
crofs in the holy land.
His arms then (as appears by his feal) Were, a lion 
paflant, with a coronet upon his head-, and his brother Ivo's, a lion paffant 
without any crown.
So that the ancient arms of the Veteriponts feem to have 
been a lion paflant, and that the coronet was added upon the advancement and 
promotion of Robert to his honours, and dignities ; for he had not only thofe 
places and pofTeflions in England which have been hitherto fpoken of, but his 
brother's alfo in Normandy (who feeras to have been the elder brother, and to 
have inherited the family eftate there) which were given to the faid Robert by 
king John, on Ivo's fiding with the king's enemies in Normandy.
[Their 
feals Mr. Machel fays he found amongft the Blenkinfop papers at Helbeck 
relating to Shap abbey.] Howbeif, though this was their bearing then, yet 
not long after (by what occafion appeareth not) their arms were changed â€¢, for 
John, fon of this fame Robert, bore annulets : and the coat which is now 
owned by his pofterity, is this ; viz.
Gules, fix annulets Or, 3, 2, and 1.
And their feal is an armed man on horfeback, bearing a fhield charged with 
annulets, and the horfe trapped with the fame.
And here perhaps it may not 
be amifs to o'oferve, how feveral ancient families do agree in their arms; fome 
borrowing probably their arms of the lords of whom they held in fee ; others 
by taking the arms (as they duly might) of thofe perfons to whom they were 
related, or moft devoted.
Therefore as the Veteriponts bore fix annulets, 
3, 2, and 1 ; fo alfo do the Mufgraves and Lowthers : varying only in colour, 
for diftinc~bion fake.
This Robert de Veteripont married Idonea, daughter and heir of John Builly, 
fon and heir of Richard de Builly, fon and heir of Jordan de Builly, fon and 
heir of Arnold, uncle and heir of Roger, fon of Roger, that in the reign of 
icing Henry the firft was lofd of the caftle and manor of Tickhill in Yorkfhire ; 
and by that title Robert de Veteripont and Idonea his wife demanded the fame 
in 
BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
(Veteriponts.) a;i 
in a writ of righr, againft Alice countefs of Ewe, in the 4 Hen. 3.
which 
ended in a cornpromife and partition.
The faid Robert de Veteripont, having been 24 years fherifFof Weflmorland, 
died in the 12th year of king Henry the third, and was buried in the Midd!e 
Temple in Fleetflreet London ; to the brethren whereof he gave his moiety of 
the manor of Wycum in Buckinghamfhire.
Idonea his wife died about 7 years after, in the 19 Hen. 3.
and was buried 
at Rupe or Roch abbey in Yorkshire, which her grandfather Richard de Builly 
aforefaid had founded and endowed.
They had iffue a fon John de Veteripont ; and a daughter Chrifiian, married 
to Thomas, fon of William, fon of Ralph baron of Grayflock, the wardfhip of 
which Thomas had been granted by the king to the faid Robert.
John de Veteripont, fon and heit of Robert de Veteripont and Idonea his 
wife, was the iecond lord of the honour of Appleby, baron of Weflmorland, 
and fheriff by inheritance; but not of the caftle, honour, and manor of Tick- 
hill -, for his father and mother in the 6 Hen. 3.
paffed the fame away by fine 
to the aforefaid Alice countefs of Ewe.
In the time of this John, Walter de Stirkland and Robert de Hellebeck, 
eolleclors of the aids of the crown, rendered an account of eight marks for 
four knights fees of John de Veteripont for his barony of Weflmorland ; of 
four marks for two knights fees of William de Lancaftre for his barony of 
Kendale; of two marks for one knights fee of Ralph de Aincourt and Patrick 
fon of Thomas of the faid barony of Kendale ; of four fhillings for the tenth 
part and twentieth part of one knight's fee of Roger de Lancaltre of the fame ; 
and of feveral other fmall fhares of knights fees in feveral hands parcelled out 
in the faid barony of Kendale.
The faid John de Veteripont fold off fome part of the lands of the barony 
of Weflmorland.
He married Sibilla daughter of William Ferrars earl of Derby, and by her 
had iffue a fon Robert.
He died young, after he had been about 12 or 14 
years lord of Weflmorland, about the 26th year of king Henry the third.
His widow Sibilla was married afterwards to Francis de Bohune, lord of Mid- 
hurfl in Suffex, who founded Cowdry-houfe there.
Robert de Veteripont, fon and heir of John, was very young at his fa- 
ther's death, and consequently was a long time ward to the king, and in the 
euftody of the prior of CarliQe ; who fuffered great wafle to be made in his 
eflate, his houfes at Appleby and other places to go to decay, his game to be 
deflroyed, and his woods cut down; as appears by an inquifition thereof taken 
at that time.
He married Ifabeila Fitz Peter, fecond fifler and afterwards one of the co- 
heirs of Richard fon of John Fitz Geofrey fon of Geofrey Fitz Peter, baron of 
Berkhamflead, and chief juftice of England.
This Robert, after he came of full years, was one of thofe who fided with 
Montfort earl of Leicefler and Humphrey de Bohun and other lords, barons 
againft king Henry the third.
He died of the wounds he had received 
in 
tyt BARONY OT WESTMORLAND.
(Veteripo-nts.) 
in the battle of Lewes in Suffex or that of Evefliam in Worcefterfhire.
And 
after his death, the king feized all his lands, but afterwards reftored then) to 
his children.
For the faid king, at the intercefEonof Edward his fon, by let- 
ters dated at Oxford, Apr. 26-, in the 50th year of his reign, remitted to 
Ifabella and Ivetla, daughters and heirs of Robert de Veteripont deceafed, 
who held of the king in capite, the trefpafs which the faid Robert committed 
by adhering to Simon de Montford heretofore earl of Leicefter and his fautors 
the king's enemies-, fo that the faid Ifabella and Ivetla be not troubled nor 
molefled by any action to be brought by the king in refpect of the lands and 
tenements defcended to them from the faid Robert: Yet fo, that if it mall 
happen that the faid Ifabella and Ivetta (hull die without heirs of their bodies, 
the faid lands and tenements dial!
remain to the king for the forfeiture of the 
faid Robert.
â€” -Upon this Sir Matthew Hale obferves, that there was no attain- 
der in thi> cafe, and confequently that this was not a reftitution, but a pardon of 
a feizure, which was ulually made in the faid times in fuch cafes, as well after 
the death, as in the life-time of the offender.
So that now Ifabella and Ivetta 
were feifed by force of .the eftate granted to their great grandfather Robert.
[Note, This is the only re:ord wherein we have found the younger daughter 
called by the name of Ivetta; elfewhere, fhe is called ldonea.] 
When the wife of this laft Robert died, is not known j but probably be- 
fore him.
The elder daughter Ifabella was not much above ten years of age at the death 
of her father â€¢, and the other daughter ldonea was fix or feven years younger.
So that by reafon of their non-age the king had them in wardfhip, and com- 
mitted them to the cuftody of two great men Roger de Clifford of Clifford- 
caftle in Herefordlhire, and Roger de Laybourne of the county of Kent ; who 
married them, after they became of proper age, to their two fons and heirs, 
Roger de Clifford^ and Roger de Leybourne.
In the 51 Hen. 3.
there was an agreement between the two Rogers the guar- 
dians, touching a partition to be made between them.
And afterwards, Ro- 
ger de Clifford the father having married Ifabella to Roger his eldeft fon, they 
came to a new partition or agreement, not much differing from the former.
By which, Roger de Clifford and Iiabella his wife were to have the manor of 
Brougham i a moiety of the manors of Merton, Appleby, Winton, and Burgh; 
a moiety of the forefts of Whinfell and Malleritang ; three parts of the manor 
of Meburn Regis ; and a moiety of the profits of the fheriffwick : and ldonea 
was to have the catlle of Burgh â€¢, a moiety of the manors of Merton, Appleby, 
Winton, and Burgh-, the manor of Kirkby Stephen; the caMe of Maller- 
ftang; a fourth part of the manor of Meburn Regis; a moiety of the forefts 
of Whinfell and Malleritang; and a moiety of the profits of the fheriffwick.
All which appears by the inquifitions after the death of the two Rogers the 
hufbands, the one in the eleventh, and the other in the twelfth years of king 
Edward the firft *.

The two filters being then become widows, it is faid that Ifabella the elder 
fate perfonally in court and executed the office of fheriff.
But the profits of 
the fheriffwick, it is evident from the above inquifuions, were divided be- 
tween the two filters, and the office during their lives was generally executed 
by an under-fheriff.
Neverthelefs Ifabella, as the elder filler, claimed the fole 
right of appointing the under-fheriff-, which Idonea contended : and it ended 
in a compromife, that Ifabella fbould prefent, and Idonea fhould approve.
Thus, in Michaelmafs term, >5 Ed. 1.
Ifabella de Clifford fheriffefs of Weft- 
morland prefented to the barons, of the exchequer Robert Morevill her under- 
fheriff by her letters patent which the faid Robert produced before the faid 
barons ; who'was admitted, and took the oath faithfully to execute his office, 
and to anfwer to her and Idonea herfifter parcener of the inheritance.
And in the Michaelmafs term in the 1 8th year of the faid king: â€” Whereas 
Ifabella de Clifford, eldefl daughter and coheir of Robert de Veteripont here- 
tofore fheriff of Weflmorland in fee, to whom belongeth the office of (he riff 
of Weflmorland according to an ordinance before the barons of the exchequer 
by common affent made between the faid Ifabella and Idonea her filter, hath

" year of the reign of our lord Edward the king." And thereupon the faid 
Ralph was admitted and took the oath in that behalf accuftomed*.
The faid Ifabella furvived her hufband about eight years, and never married 
again.
Idonea lived many years after, and married to her fecond hufbard John 
de Crombwell of a Northumberland family, but died without iffue.
After 
whole deceafe the whole Veteripont inheritance became veiled in the heirs of 
JJabella by her hufband Roger de Clifford aforefaid, v/hofe family therefore we 
proceed next to deduce.
Pie was defcended of a noble family of the Cliffords o>i Clifford-caftle in the- 
cpunty of Hereford ; which had its name from being placed on a rock or cliffy 
near 2.
ford upon the river Wye.
Before their coming to Clifford-caftle, the furname of this family was Pons, 
and they were of Norman extraction.
For this Roger who married Ifabella 
was defcended of Roger fecond fon of Walter de Clifford and Margaret de 
Tony his wife, daughter and heir of Ralph de Tony lord of Clifford-caftle 
(with whom he had the faid caftle) â€¢, which Walter, who was the firft that 
aiTumed the furname^ Clifford, was fon to Richard Fitz Pons, fon of William 
earl of Argues in Normandy, fecond fon of Richard duke of Normandy fur- 
named Ponz.
This Walter de Clifford was father of the fair but unfortunate Rofamond, 
whole tomb is to be feen at Godftow in Oxfordfhire, to which place her father 
became a benefactor after her deceafe.
And from her defcended (by king 
Henry the fecond) the family of the Longfpees earls of Salifbury ; the lair 
of which name, to wit, William grandfon of the firft- earl, married Maud 
daughter and fole heir of Walter de Clifford, grandfon of the firft Walter, 
father of the faid Rofamond â€¢, and they had only a daughter, whofe name was 
Margaret.
So that this match put a period to both thefe families of Clifford 
and Longfpee in the direct: male line.
Roger, younger brother of the faid laft Walter, married Sibilla daughter 
and heir of Robert de Ewias, lord and baron of Ewias-caftle in Herefordfhire, 
and widow of lord Robert Tregos.
They had ifTue Roger of whom we fpeak> 
who married Ifabella de Veteripont as- aforefaid.
And here beginneth the 
iff Generation of the- Cliffords in Wefimorland.
The firft of the name of Clifford, that came to be feated in Weftmorland, 
was Roger de Clifford furnamed the younger, by reafon of his father 
(whofe name alfo was Roger) being cotemporary with him; for he outlived 
his fon five years.
â€¢ All this concerning the (heriffwick was tranferibed by Mr. Machel from the copies of records 
in Sir William Dugdale's collection: Which records it is probable had not occurred to the com- 
pilers of the countefs of Pembroke's memoirs; notwithilanding that all the public offices feem to 
have been fearcrled with great diligence by the order and at the expence of the faid countefs.
What' 
here follows, concerning the Cliffords, is taken chiefly from the faid valuable memoirs.

Both he and his father were chief commanders, for 20 years together, ia 
the wars of England, Ireland, and France, in the reigns of king Henry the 
third and Edward the firft.
His paternal inheritance was the manor of Temedbury, which is part in 
Worcefterfhire and part in Hereford (hire ; but his eftate was largely aug- 
mented by the donation of king Hen. 3.
who gave to this Roger the younger, 
in the 48th year of his reign, 100 marks in land, with the appurtenances, in 
the vale of Monmouth, for the fervice of one knight's fee.
His paternal 
eftate of Temedbury continued in the family till the reign of queen Elizabeth, 
when it was fold by Henry lord Clifford.
The other eftate, in the vale of 
Monmouth, was given back to the crown in exchange for Skipton-caftle.
But the greateft advancement of eftate and honour was brought unto him 
by the marriage of his wife, namely, a moiety of the whole Veteripont eftate 
as above fet forth and deicribed.
He built the greateft part of Brougham -cattle, and over the inner door 
placed this infcription, " This made Roger:" which, by reafon of the ambi- 
guity, caufed fome to queftion whether it was to be underftood from thence 
that Roger made the caftle, or the caftle made him, that is, augmented his 
eftate by that large acceffion of fortune which came to him by his wife.
He was (lain at the age of 40, in the ifle of Anglefey, in the king's fervice 
againft the Welch.
id Generation.
Robert de Clifford, fon and heir of Roger and tfabella, was about eight 
years of age at his father's death.
In the 20 Ed. 1.
before Hugh Creffingham and his affociates, juftices itine- 
rant at Appleby, the king demanded againft Idonea de Layburne, 1600 acres 
of wood and 1000 acres of pafture in Kirkby Stephen and Burgham, the 
caftle of Burgh, the manors of Appleby, Meburn Regis, and other places ; 
and fet forth feifin thereof in king Henry the fecond.
She alledged, that 
Robert de Veteripont her anceftor died feifed of the premiffes, and they de- 
fcended to her and Robert de Clifford within age : She prayed aid of him, and 
that for his non-age the plea might demur.
The truth of the allegation was 
found by the jury, and thereupon the plea flayed.
â€” Hereupon Sir Matthew 
Hale obferves, that this no way impeached the title â€¢, nothing being more 
common in eyre, than when they found at any time a feifin in the crown, to 
put in informations of Quo warranto to make the tenants itt forth their title.
In the fame eyre, an information of Quo warranto was prefented againft the 
fame Idonea, to fhew by what right fhe claimeth to have free chafe in New-

Robert de Vefpunt died feifedof the aforefaid tenements which the faid ldonea

and of the aforefaid liberties in like

Which 
Robert fon of Ifabella is under age, without whom fhe cannot anfwer.
And 
the jurors find, that the faid Robert de Vefpunt the anceftor died feifed of the 
aforefaid liberties, and that the faid ldonea hath not feifed any of the fame as 
of her own proper fee, and that Robert fon of the aforefaid Ifabella is under 
age.
Therefore let the plea remain till his full age.
This Robert de Clifford is faid to have been the greateft man of all this 
family, being of a moft martial and heroic fpirit.
In the 25FA.
1. when he 
was about 23 years of age, he was made the king's captain, and keeper of

In the 26th of the faid king, he was fummoned to come 
with his horfe and arms to Carlifle againfl the Scots.
He was one of the four guardians appointed by king Edward the firft, for 
Edward his fon and fucctffor : And was juftice of the king's forefts on the 
north of Trent.
He was made admiral of England in the firft year of Edward the fecond â€¢, 
and lord marcher alio about the fame time: And in refpeel of his great and 
laudable fervice, had the honour of Skipton caftle in Craven in Yorkfhire be- 
ftowed upon him, at fit ft for life, and afterwards (in confideration of giving 
back to the crown the lands above mentioned in the vale of Monmouth) to 
him and his heirs for ever.

His body was fent to king Edward at Berwick,: 
but where it was buried is not certainly known.
By agreement with his aunt Idonea and her fecond hufband, this Robert en- 
joyed the whole Weftmorland eftate.
And what that was, appears fully by 
the inquifition taken after his death, which is the mod complcat of any of 
the inquifitions poft mortem of the Clifford family.

The 
fum total of the cornage amounted to 27/ 155 9 d.
The ward mips alfo, when 
they mould happen, were reflectively valued.
The lady Maud outlived her hufband, and married again about four years 
after to one Robert de Wells, and died in the firft year of king Edward the 
third.
The ifTue which fhe had to lord Robert de Clifford were, 
1. Roger, who fucceeded his father.
2. Robert, who fucceeded his brother Roger.
3. Idonea de Clifford, who was married to Henry lord Piercy, and by him 
had ifTue that Henry lord Piercy who married Mary daughter of Henry Plan- 
tagenet earl of Lancafter, and had iiTue by her Henry lord Piercy firft earl of 
Northumberland.
â€¢k ^d Generation: 
Roger de Clifford, fon and heir of Robert, was about 15 years of age 
at his father's death.
He was attainted of treafon in the 15 Ed. 2.
(being 
then about 23 years of age) for adhering to Thomas earl of Lancafter.
And during the time of his eftate being in the king's hands, there is a writ 
in the 19 Ed. 2.
to the conftable of the king's caftle at Appleby, to pay four 
marks yearly out of his cornage or horngelt to Shap abbey, which ab^ey had 
been endowed therewith by Robert fon of John de Veteripont ;, which feems 
to have been then behind and unpaid, fince the forfeiture of Roger aforefaid.
And the king granted to Sir Andrew de Harclay the caftles and manors of 
Brougham,.

with the wood of Whynnefeld, together with the fheiiffwick ; referving to 
himielf the cornage *.
Which being again forfeited by Sir Andrew, the 
fame, together with the reft of the eftate, lands, and honours were reftored 
to the laid Roger by king Edward the third in the firft year of his reign.
But 
he enjoyed them not above a month, until he died.
He was never married ; fo that his brother Robert fucceeded to his honours 
and eftate.
He had fome illegitimate children by one Julian of the Bower ; for whom he 
built a little ho ufe hard by Whinfell, which ftill bears her name.
Robert de Clifford, fecond fon of Robert, fucceeded his brother Roger.
This Robert received a great addition to his eftate by the death of his great 
aunt Idonea de Veteripont, who had been married, as is aforefaid, to Roger 
de Layburne (to whom Ihe had iftue a fon John^ who died an infant); and af- 
ter that, to John de Crombwell, to whom fhe had no iftue.
She died in a 
good old age, about the 8th year of king Edward the third, after having fur- 
vived her father about 70 years.
By whofe death the eftate of the Veteriponts, 
which had been divided between the two fifters for want of male iftue, became 
again united in the fame family.
r l his Robert lived for the moll part a country life; no martial atchievements 
being recorded of him, further than that he accompanied the earl of Warwick 
and other lords with an army into Scotland.
He married Ifabella de Berkeley, daughter of Maurice lord Berkeley, of 
Berkeley-caftle in Gloucefterfhire : And had for her portion 1000/ and 50 
marks, with a gown of fcarlet cloth having a cape furred with the bcft mini- 
ver; and for the honour of the bride, her brother the lord Berkeley and his 
lady were attired in the like apparel.
The bride- faddle coft 5/ (that is about 
50/, according to the prefent diminimed value of the coin).
All the lands of 
Skipton, and a great part of the lands in Westmorland, were fettled upon her 
by way of jointure.
He died, May 20, in the 18 Ed. 3.
in the 39th year of his age or there- 
abouts, having poftcfied his eftate about 17 years; and was buried in Shap 
abbey, as molt likely feveral of his anceftors had been before.
His wife furvived him ; and married again, about *wo or three -f- years after 
his deceafe to Sir Thomas Mufgrave knight, whom fhe left furviving.

^th Generation.
Robert lord Clifford, fon of Robert and Ifabella de Berkeley, was 13; 
years and 6 months old at the death of his father, and confequently was ward 
to the king 7 years and 6 months.
And notwithstanding his being fo young, 
he was married before his father's death, to Euphemia one of the daughters 
of Ralph de Nevill lord of Middleham-caftle in Yorklhire, and filter of Ralph 
de Nevill the firft of that family who was created earl of Weftmorland.
He ferved king Edward the third in his wars in France, and was with the 
Black Prince in the battle of Crefly, when he was but 16 years of age.
The faid king by his letters patent granted to this Robert, for his good and 
laudable fervice, 12/ 14 s 8~d of lands which were Chriitopher Seaton's, the 
king's enemy, in Cumberland.
He had the leaft eftate of any of the lords Cliffords either before or after 
him, by reafon that his mother had all the lands in Skipton, and great part of 
the lands in Weftmorland in her jointure during his life, and (he outlived him 
two months.
He died, in France as is fuppofed, about the 32d year of his age, without 
any ifllie.
His widow was afterwards married to Sir Walter Hazlerton, and- died in the 
18 Ric 2, 
Roger de Clifford fecond fon of lord Robert and Ifabella de Berkeley, 
was accounted one of the wifeft men of his time.
He was a man of much 
gallantry and valour, being often in the wars both in France and Scotland 5 
particularly, in that remarkable fea voyage of the earl of Arundel,- when he> 
tranfported a great army to aflift the duke of Britanny againft the French king.
He was a lover of building, and took great care to repair the ancient caitles, 
the feats of his ancestors.
In Michaelmafs term, 3 Ric. 2.
he prefented to the treafurer and barons of 
the exchequer William de Lancaltre (baron of Kendal) to be his under- (he riff", 
during his pleafure.
Whereupon a mandate was iflfued to the abbot of Shap 
to adminifter to him the oath of office, and notify the fame to William de 
Warthecop the late under- fheriff, requiring him to deliver over to the faid 
William de Lancaftre by indenture the writs and other things belonging to the 
faid office.
One Robert de Herle, knight, releafed and quit-claimed to this Roger, his 
heirs and affigns, all his right and claim in one meffuage and tenement in 
Fleet-itreet, next to St. Dunftan's church, which is now one of the inns of

He died in peace at home, which few of his anceftors or fucceflbrs did, in 
the 15 Ric. 2.
juftioo years after the death of his great grandmother Ifabella 
de Veteripont, in the 57th year of his age.

3. Sir Lewis Clifford, who in the 47 Ed. 3.
accompanied the duke of Lan- 
cafter into France.
He was chofen one of the knights of the garter.
In the 
9 Ric. 2.
he was commander in chief of the city of Carlifle, when the Scots 
and French attacked it, which he valiantly defended, and forced them to 
jetire.
The faid duke of Lancafter was a favourer of the doctrines of "Wicliff, 
which induced feveral of the followers of that duke to efpoufe thofe doctrines.
Amongft whom was this Sir Lewis Clifford : But he afterwards renounced the 
lame, and confeffed his error to the archbiihop of Canterbury.

John, at the death of his father, was 20 years and 23 weeks old; where- 
upon he became ward to the king for half a year and three weeks, although 
he had been a commander in the king's army for three years before that.
After his father's death, he continued a&ive in the kind's fervice in the 
civil wars, which were then very hot between the houfes of York and Lan- 
cafter.
In Grafton's and Speed's account of thofe times it is recorded, that this 
John lord Clifford was one of the chief leaders of the queen's army in De- 
cember 1460 (the king being then a prifoner), together with lord Nevil and 
lord Roffe and in effect all the northern nobility, at Wakefield battle ; where 
the duke of York amongft many nobles was (lain, with his young fun the earl 
of Rutland, who fell in flight by the hands of lord Clifford, in part of re- 
venge ; for the earl's father had flain his.

able to bear arms, being 16 or 17 years of age, as is evident (fay the countefs 
of Pembroke's memoirs) from this, that he was next child to king Edward

then 18 years of age: And for the fmall diftance betwixt her children, fee.

The lord Clifford was then 25 years of age.
The faid lord John was at the fecond battle of St. Albans, where king 
Henry the fixth was brought into his tent on the 17th of February, and met 
his wife there, with his fon prince Edward, to his exceeding great joy.
But 
it lafted not long ; for on the 28th and 29th of March following, the latter of 
thofe days being Palm Sunday, was the great battle fought between Towton.
and Saxton in Yorkshire, where king Henry's party was totally overthrown, 
and this lord John flain, between Ferrybridge and Caftleford by the river Aire,.
* Grafton's account of this matter is thus : " While this battaile was in fighting, a pried called 
Sir Robert Afpall, chaplaine and fcholemafler to the yong erle of Rutland, the fecond fon to the 
above named duke of York, fcarce of the age of iz years, a fayre gentleman, and a maydcnly per- 
fon, perceiving that flight was more favegard than tariyng both for him and his mailer, fecretly 
conveyed the erle out of the field, by the lord Cliffbrdes bande, toward the towne ; but or he, 
could enter into a houfe, he was by the fayde lord Clifforde efpyed, folowed, and taken, and 
by reafon of his apparell demanded what he was.
The yong gentleman, difmayde, had- not a

With that,

will I do thee and all thy 'kinne; and with that worde ftrake the erle to the hart with his dagger, 
and bad his chapleyn beare.

gentlemen of quality to the number of 4 or 5000 perfons in a pit by the river 
Aire, near to the place where the battle was fought, where a chapel (now 
decayed) was built, and did for lb me time remain their monument.
His widow was afterwards married to Sir Lancelot Threlkeld of Threlkeld 
in Cumberland, who proved a very kind, hufband to her, and helped to conceal, 
her two children, which fhe had by her faid former hufband the lord Clifford, 
from the fury of king Edward the fourth and the houfe of York, to which

And the faid Richard, when king, granted the fheriffwick to Sir

But when king Henry the feventh obtained the crown, the good fervices of

was reftored (by an act of parliament made in the firft year of the faid king 
Henry the feventh, intitled, " An acl: for Henry lord Clifford") to his eftate

Which acl: was the principal ground of the lady Anne Clifford's

From henceforth the faid Henry lord Clifford became baron of Weftmor- 
land, and hereditary fheriff of the fame, lord alfo of the honour of Skipton, 
and baron of Vefcy.
Before this time, he was not able to write any thing at all, by reafon of his

When called to parliament, he behaved nobly and wifely; but 
otherwife came feldom at London or the court; and lather delighted to live 
in the country, where he repaired feveral of his caftles which had gone to decay 
during the late troubles.
He was about 31 years of age when he came to his 
eftates, and enjoyed the fame about 27 years.
He was twice married ; firft, to Anne daughter of Sir John St. John of

Queen Elizabeth made him knight of the garter ; 
and he was her champion in all the tiltingj from the 31ft year of her reign till

And in that he excelled all the nobles of his time.
For he was fo much addicted to tilting, horfecourfing, ihooting, and other

Whither alfo afterwards his brother Francis's body was brought,

And in the fame year, by his will he devifed the fame to the purpofes afore- 
faid ; giving to his daughter, befides the faid reverfion, the fum of 15000/ 
for her portion.
He devifed alfo the fheriffwick to his brother : which not 
being in the aforefaid intail, his brother took pofleflion thereof during the 
widow's life.
i%tb Generation.
Anne, fole daughter and heir of George earl of Cumberland, by his wife 
the lady Margaret Ruflfel.
Upon her father's death, (he (by the advice and 
under the direction of her mother) contefted the fettlement ; grounding her 
claim, on the intail by king John upon Robert de Veteripont and the heirs of 
his body by his then wife; on the like grant by king Edward the third to the 
two daughters of the fecond Robert upon the forfeiture by their father > and 
on the aforefaid act of parliament in the 1 Hen. 7.
Upon this, king James (who commonly made himfelf a party in any caufe 
of confiderable confequence depending in his courts either of law or equity) 
in order to ftrengthen the earl Francis's title, in the fifth year of his reign, 
granted to the faid Francis, his heirs and afiigns, to the effect following ; to 
wit, " All our catties, demefnes, and manors, of Appleby and Burgh; and 
alfo the whole bailiwick or office of fheriff of the county of Weftmorland, 
and the rents of the county of Weftmorland aforefaid, and the fervices of all 
our tenants within the fame county who do not hold of us by knight's fervice ; 
and all and fingular rights, jurisdictions, liberties, profits, commodities, ad- 
vantages, emoluments, and hereditaments whatfoever, to the faid office of 
fheriff or bailiwick belonging or appertaining: And all that whole eftate what- 
foever, which the faid Francis's anceftors had held, in the counties of Weft- 
morland and York.
To hold by the fervice of fix knights fees and an half." 
With all the ufual non obflante's, and particularly with a non obftante of the 
act of parliament of the 23 Hen. 6.
(which enacts, that no fheriff fhall abide 
in his office above one year ; with an exception, neverthelefs, of fuch perfons 
as had then an inheritance in the office.) 
The king alfo took much pains to get himfelf made arbitrator of thefe dif- 
ferences.
During the courfe of the contention, the faid Anne was married to her fir ft 
hufband the lord Buckhurft.
This lord, together with her uncle and his fon, 
agreed to accept of the king's arbitration ; and the king took upon him to 
make an award, although the faid Anne, when fhe was brought into his pre- 
fence, utterly refufed to fubmit to his arbitration.
And his majefty's award 
(which was in her disfavour) was confirmed in the court of chancery.
And 
judgment was given againfl her in the fame year in the court at York for the 
northern parts.
Her uncle obtained pofTeffion of the eftate, and he and his 
fon after him kept the fame till the death of the faid fon as aforefaid without

ififue male.
By whofe death, the faid Anne became undeniably intitled, both 
as heir to her lather, and as next aifo in the intail.
Her faid hufband died in the year 1624, in the 35th year of his age : who 
had iffue by her (befides three fons who died very young) two daughters 
Margaret and Ifabella -, the latter of whom was married to James Compton 
earl of Northampton, to whom fhe had fix children, who all died without iffue, 
and moft of them very young.
So that after the death of Ifabella and her chil- 
dren, Margaret remained iole heir of the Clifford family.
About fix years after the death of her faid firft hufband the lord Buckhurft 
(who at the time of his death was become earl of Dorfet), the lady Anne mar- 
ried to her fecond hufband Philip Herbert earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, 
and had to him only two fons, who died foon after they were born.
About this time, whilft earl Francis was in poffefiion of the eftate, a dif- 
pute happened about the cornage, commonly called nowtgelt, and the fer- 
jeant oats or bailiff corn.
The tenants of the feveral manors denied to pay 
the fame ; and, fuppofing the fame to be payable, they complained of divers 
grievances in the manner of collection.
On the 23d of May 1634, (10 Car.) 
it was decreed by the lord keeper Coventry, That the faid duties did of right 
belong to the faid earl of Cumberland as lord of the fee and feigniory of Weft- 
morland: but that, for prevention of abufes, the oats fhall be gathered yearly 
between St. Andrew's day and Candlemafs : That upon 8 or 10 days warning 
to be given to every town by the lord's bailiff for the time being, the fame 
fhall be brought to one place certain in the town, by the faid bailiff likewife to 
be made known at the fame time of warning, that the bailiff may know where 
to demand and expeÂ£t the fame : That fuch town as fhall not have their pro- 
portion ready, fhall within one month after bring them home to the faid earl's 
officer, or otherwife the townfhip fo failing to be fubjec"t to a diftrefs for the 
fame, or the earl to take fuch other courfe for recovery thereof as he fhall think 
fit : That the faid oats fhall be good and marketable according to the feafon 
of the year, not putting the worft and refufe upon the officer, but fuch as fhall 
be of the better fort.
And Sir John Lowther was defired to examine and 
certify concerning the meafure ; who having examined two old pecks, one 
containing 8, and the other 10 ftriked quarts, both of which had been paid 
upheaped (which was reckoned one third part more), he, to avoid uncertainty, 
recommended, and fo it was decreed, that inftead of the old peck upheaped, 
they fhould pay 13 quarts ftriked; and the nowtgeld to be paid in money as 
before *.

" Capplethwaite being fold, my father then bought a fmall eftate a mile 
" above Sedbergh ; from whence I and my fecond brother went every day to 
" the fchool there, being then of great note and eminence, under Mr. Gil- 
" bertNelfon the worthy fchoolmafter; who out of his love and affection to 
" me, when my father began to decay in his eftate, took me into his own 
" houfe, and gave me diet and lodging for a year and above, with other 
Â«* fcholars then boarders there.
" A great honour I had for the memory of fo worthy a perfon ; and though 
" God did not prolong his life till my coming into the north in 1652, yet I 
*' had the means and opportunity, by the favour of my moft honoured lady 
" the countefs of Pembroke, to place his widow (then in a low condition) 
" mother of her ladyfhip's alms-houfe in Appleby, then newly built and en- 
" dowed by her -, where fhe had a convenient chamber, a garden, and 8 / a 
" year, during her life ; taking a daughter of hers at the fame time into her 
** fervice, from whence fhe was after well married.
" When I had fpent fome years at Sedbergh fchool, I was fent to St. John's 
" college in Cambridge, fubfizer to George Brathwaite of Warcop efquire, 
" fellow commoner of that college.
My tutor was Mr. Thomas Fothergill" 
[who was born at Brounber in Ravenftondale, and was afterwards mafter of 
the faid college.] 
Then he relates, how not being able to fupport himfelf at the univerfity 
any longer, he removed to London, where his father had got into fome fmall 
bufinefs ; and after recounting feveral adventures there, the narration proceeds 
as follows : 
** My good father, ftudying all ways and means to provide for me, God 
" put into his mind to make ufe of a letter which many years he had care- 
" fully kept, written from the lady Margaret countefs of Cumberland, to my 
" grandfather Mr. Jeffrey Sedgwick, giving him many thanks for his upright 
" dealing as a juror at York, in the great caufe there tried, between her 
" daughter then countefs of Dorfet, and Francis earl of Cumberland her 
Â°' uncle ; with which letter fhe alfo fent my faid grandfather half a buck, and 
" a gold ring, with this motto, Truth is crowned.
DO 7 * 
" My father one morning taking that letter and me along with him, went 
" to the court at Whitehall, to wait upon the faid countefs of Dorfet, then 
11 countefs of Pembroke, Dorfet, and Montgomery, by her marriage with 
" Philip earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, then lord chamberlain of his 
*' majefty's houlhold.
" As foon as that lady faw that letter of her dear mother, whom fhe loved 
" with an entire affection, fhe feemed very glad of a prefent opportunity fhe 
*' then had to do me good.
So fhe fent forthwith for one of her lord's fecre- 
" taries, whom fhe called coufin, who was then deftitute of a young clerk, 
" and immediately preferred me to him.
And v/ith him I continued five or 
" fix years very happily and contentedly.
" In the year 1039, the troubles in Scotland began ; and the king's ma- 
*' jefty raifed a gallant army againft them : And feveral of the great nobility 
" fupplied the king with money.
Among the reft, the lord chamberlain ad- 
4 " vanced 
2*6 BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
(Cliffords.) 
*' vanced twenty thoufand pounds.
And in further teftimony of his forward- 
" nefs in the king's fervice, he then railed a regiment of 600 horfe, being 
" fix troops compleat, for the guard of his majefty's perfon ; confifting of 
â– " the king's fervants, and the fervants of the noblemen and gentlemen volun- 
" teers, his lordfhip's friends.
The commanders of thefe fix troops, being 
" perfons of great rank and quality, are fit to be remembered ; viz.
Philip 
" earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, colonel ; the earl of Caernarvon, his 
" fon-in law, Philip lord Herbert, his eldeft fon ; Sir Ralph Hopton, knight 
" of the Bath, afterwards lord Hopton ; Sir Bevil Greenvill, father of the 
" now earl of Bath ; Sir Foulke Hunkes, a Low Country colonel.
Colonel 
" Thomas Carew, deputy governor of the ifle of Wight, was commiiTary 
" and mufter-mafter.
And I was appointed by them to make their and their 
" under-offkers commiffions, and to be the paymafter of the regiment.
" In the beginning of the long unhappy parliament in 1640, my matter 
" the fecretary was chofen burgels of Salisbury ; who thereupon quitted his 
M relation to his lordlhip, and he was pleafed to accept of my fervice in his 
" place.
" I thought myfelf then in a very good condition.
But by reafon of a fall- 
* c ing out between my lord and matter the lord chamberlain and the lord 
" Mowbray and Maltravers, in the houfe of peers â€¢, they were both fent pri- 
" loners to the Tower of London, there to remain during the pleafure of the 
*' two houfes of parliament, where they continued eight days.
And during 
" my mailer's imprifonment, the king took away his chamberlain's ItafT.
And 
" fhortly after, he retired into the country â€¢, where he kept a noble houfe, 
" entertaining his friends, neighbours, and tenants, with great freedom.
" Then v/as I reduced only to the employment for his lordfhip's private af- 
" fairs and eltate, which notwithstanding was confiderable.
And thus I lived 
iC with him till the time of his death, which was in January 1649.
" Though he had 18000/ a year, yet through the vaft charge in keeping 
" hounds, hawks, and hunting hories, his great hofpitality, and other ways 
'* and means, he died 55000/ in debt, which by the care of his honourable 
''â–  executors was all paid within four years time.
" In how noble and fplendid a manner he lived, may in part appear from 
" this â€¢, that his family in London was for the mod part about 80, in the 
" country double that number.
And he was always attended by perfons of 
" good note and quality.
" He was fecond fon of Henry Herbert earl of Pembroke and lord pre- 
" fident of Wales.
His mother was lady Mary Sidney, filler to the famous 
" Sir Philip Sidney, author of the Arcadia.
" His father left him 10,000/ in money, and 300/ a year in quit rents.
" Upon his father's death, he applied himlelf to the court, where in two 
** years time he had fpent ail his money.
But by his pleafing king James in 
" his hunting exercifes, he got foon into great favour with him, fo as that 
i< - king in a (hort time heaped honours and riches upon him.
He firft 
c< knighted him ; then he created him baron of Shurland ; fhortly after, earl 
4 ' of Montgomery, and lord chamberlain of his houfhold ; giving him 2000I

*' a year lands in the ifle of Sheppey â€¢, and Enfield -houfe, park, and chafe, 
" worth as much more.
And upon the death of his elder brother, he came 
" to the family inheritance of 14000/ a year, befides 6000/ a year more that 
" belonged to his brother's widow, which he held during her life, fhe being 
*' a lunatic.
" This earl Philip could fcarce either write or read ; not that he wanted 
" good breeding and education, but he would never be brought to mind his 
" book, being addicted to all manner of fports and recreations.
*' Yet this very perfon, upon the death of archbifhop Laud, was chofen by 
" the univerfity of Oxford for their chancellor.
Strange, that an illiterate 
" man (as he was) fhould be elected with Co general applaufe, and fo unani- 
" mous a content by them.
And it was more ftrange, that in a few years 
" after, when he was fent by the parliament with fome gentlemen, members 
" of the houfe of commons, as vifitor of that univerfity, they not only re- 
** fufed to fubmit thereunto, but received him with all the contempt and de- 
" rifion imaginable, and writ in red letters over the doors of the colleges and 
** fchools, Lord have mercy upon us, for we are visited !
â€” as is ufual 
'* in places infected with the plague.
" He was very temperate in eating and drinking, but much given to wo- 
" men, which caufed a feparation between him and his virtuous- lady Anne 
" countefs of Pembroke, feveral years before his death.
" His greater!
delight was in hunting ; lying every dry fummer in the New 
** Foreft in Hampfhire (whereof he had the command under the king) fix or 
" eight weeks together, hunting the (lag daily, keeping 24 couple of hounds 
** always for that purpofe.
" He was alio an excellent bowler ; keeping in his houfe one or two fer- 
"" vants the beft in that quality about London : fo as he would oftentimes 
** make bowling matches for 500/, which for the mod part he won.
" Upon his death, his eldeft fon Philip, then earl of Pembroke, was de- 
â€¢" firous to have me continue with him in the fame employment I had under 
" his father.
So I ftaid.
" At my firft coming to him, he became, or at leaft he counterfeited him- 
" felf, a quaker.
But I rather believe he was not really one, being allured, 
" that for feveral years he fent his majefty that now is, in his exile, 2000/ a 
" year.
However, he was of fuch a difpofuion, that he never minded his 
" own bufinefs, but fhifted it off from time to time.
So that after I had 
" been with him about two years, I grew weary of any longer attendance 
" upon him.
" I believe this earl wafted his eftate â€¢, for though he lived but in a private 
" manner, no way comparable to his father, yet he loft great fums of money 
" at bowls and dice.
One time, before I left him, he loft at Greenwich above 
Xi 300 / in money, and his coach and fix horfes.
" About that time, Sir Thomas Bendifh being to go ambaflador leiger to 
" the court of the grand Seignor at Constantinople, I had fome honourable 
â€¢* c good friends that recommended me to attend upon him as fecretary to the 
* l embafiy.
But at this juncture of time, the countefs dowager of Pembroke,

" me by letters from fo long a voyage, and invited me to come down to her, 
" to write all her poft letters, make all her leafes, and receive and pay alt 
'* her money, offering me a liberal allowance for the fame.
This courfe I 
" rather embraced, being near my friends, and the place of my nativity, 
" which all forts of people love ; rather than run the hazard perhaps of end- 
" ing my life, among pagans and infidels in a foreign climate.
" So in Auguft 1652, I came down to Skipton, where I began to do her 
" ladyfhip the bed fervice I could.
Where after I had continued to my great 
" contentment about four years, her ladyfhip then propofed to me her earned 
" defire for me to go over fea, into France, Flanders, and the Low Coun- 
" tries, with her grandfon Mr. John Tufton, fince earl of Thanet deceafed.
" I was to take charge of him abroad fome two years in thofe parts, and 
" to order his exercifes and expences, for which fhe promifed to give us good 
" allowance.
*' I muft confefs I had no great inclination to it ; but by reafon of the ma- 
" nifold favours I had received from her, and the defire I had to fee foreign 
" countries, I could not in gratitude deny her ladyfhip the beft fervice I was 
" able to perform.
" According to her promife, fhe was pleafed to affign us 400 / a year for 
" our expences, for Mr. Tufton, his man, a footman, and my ft- If. Befides

All which.

Our author then proceeds to give an account of their travels.

" Alfo the latter year of our fojourning there, the duke of York came

BARONY OF WESTMORLAND.
(Cliffords.) 
" Colein, in Tome difguft (as it was faid) ; where after he had been private fome 
" two days, the marquis of Ormond, the lord Craven, and John lord Berke- 
" ley came thither in queft of him, and to attend him back to his brother at 
" Coleine.
As foon as it was publickly known that he was in the city, all 
" the Englifh went to wait upon him and to kifs his hand â€¢, and amongft the 
" reft, myfelf had that honour.
And that was the laft time I faw his high- 
*' nefs -, whom God preferve." 
After their return, with refpedl to his own particular circumftances, he 
proceeds as follows : 
*' Before my going over fea, my lady gave me a rent charge of 20 / a year 
** for 2 1 years, and 50/ in gold.
At. our return alfo 100/ in money, and 
** another rent charge of 20/ a year for 21 years, both which I enjoyed till 
" the expiration of thofe terms.
" After 18 years fervice with this good lady, fhe began to mind me of my- 
" felf and my future well-being in the world ; often repeating to me a verfe 
" of Mr. Samuel Daniel the famous poet and hiftoriographer, who had been 
*'* her inftrufter in her childhood and youth : 
** To have fome filly home 1 do defire, 
" Loth ftill to warm me by another's fire.
" She further declared her noble intention to me, that when I met with fome 
" fmall habitation, fhe would give me 200/ towards the purchafe, which (lie 
" punctually performed.
" Within a while God directed me to Collinfield, a fmall eftate held under 
" queen Katherine, as part of her jointure, by a moderate rent and fine, 
Â« e convenient for the church and market, freed from all affizes and feffions j 
" where by God's bleffing I enjoy a quiet and retired life to my contentment j 
" having oftentimes the fociety of feveral of my worthy friends and neigh- 
" bours from the town of Kendal ; having lived here above 14 years at the 
*' writing hereof," (viz.
in December 1682.) 
As to the aforefaid countefs of Pembroke he fays, â€” " Her father died 
*' when fhe was about ten years of age, leaving her under the tuition of her 
" good mother, but her chief breeding was under her aunt the countefs of 
" Warwick, chief lady of the bed-chamber to queen Elizabeth : Her in-

** Compton earl of Northampton.
" After the earl of Dorfet's death, fhe continued a widow five years j hav- 
" ing a large jointure of 3400/ a year.
" In her firft widowhood (as I have heard her fay) fhe refolved, if God or-

And it was her fortune to light on

Q^q 2 " She

(Cliffords.) 
" She was of an undaunted fpirit, worthy the daughter of fo gallant a father.
A high contefl fhe had with king James, who would have forced her 
to accept of 10,000/ from the earl of Cumberland, and in lieu thereof to 
pafs away all her right and future claim to the inheritance of her father.
This (he abfolutely refufed to do, nor could be induced to it by any threats 
or perfuafions whatlbever.
*' Her fecond hufband the earl of Pembroke dying in the year 1649, fhe 
came down into the north, where (he continued till her death in 1675, be- 
ing 26 years, in great honour and profperity ; a year or two in Yorkshire, 
and a year or two in Weftmorland, to the great benefit of both counties, 
expending not only the rents and fines fhe had in thefe counties, but alfo 
for the mod part the rents of her two great jointures in the fouth in SufTex 
and Kent.
" At her coming down, fhe found five of her caftles and the tower of Bar- 
den demolifhed and thrown down in the late unhappy wars : Skipton-caftle, 
that had been a (lately building, fcarce affording lodging for herfelf and 
her family â€¢, fo that fhe was reiolved to build fome lodging rooms in it, 
notwithftanding the malignancy of the times.
Some gentlemen of that 
neighbourhood, her friends and well-wifhers, diffbaded her from it â€¢, al- 
ledging (and probably enough) that as faft as fhe built up Oliver Crom- 
well would order it to be pulled down.
She replied, If they do not take 
my eftate from me, as long as I have money or credit, I will repair my 
houfes, though I were fure to have them thrown down the next day.
This 
being reported to Oliver, â€” Nay, fays he, let her build what fhe will, fhe 
fhall have no hindrance from me.
" Thereupon fhe began with Skipton-caftle, and in a year's time made it a 
very convenient houfe, though not fo ftately and large as it was before it 
was demolifhed.
The fteeple alfo of Skipton church, having been for the 
moft part beaten down, when Sir John Mallory kept the caftle for the king, 
fhe caufed it to be new built as good as it was before.
" The tower of Barden alfo fhe re-edified ; and repaired the chapel there, 
and furnifhed it with feats for her neighbours and tenants of that dale, they 
being far from the parifh.
church." 
Our author next fets forth, how fhe repaired her caftles of Appleby, Brough- 
am, Brough, and Pendragon â€¢, her feveral charities at Mallerftang, Appleby, 
and Brougham â€¢, her repairing the churches of Appleby and Bongace, the 
church and chapel of Brougham, and the chapel of Maikrftang : All which 
particulars we have noted in their proper places.
Mr. Sedgwick then proceeds 
thus : 
" All thefe buildings and repairs could not be computed at lefsthan 40,00c/, 
** as may be made appear by the yearly books of account.
" She was at a vaft charge in law-fuits to vindicate her rights.
Her uncle 
" Francis earl of Cumberland, and his fon the lord Clifford, being but te- 
*' nants for life, raifed great fums of money from the tenants in Craven to 
" make them a fine certain, which was not in their power to do.
The fine 
" certain

" certain was yd fine.
She demanded only Sd fine, for making them arbi- 
" trary as before, which the faid tenants refufed to pay.
Thereupon the long 
*' law-fuit began between them, which laded feveral years both in common 
" law and chancery, and coft 4000 / on each fide ; and in the conclufion her 
" ladyfliip recovered again ft them.
During that fuit, Oliver Cromwell, then 
" protector of the commonwealth, would needs be a ftickler and interpofe in 
** behalf of the tenants â€¢, and to that purpofe iflued out a commiflion to fome 
" gentlemen of the barony of Kendal (whom I lift not to name, mot of 
" them being now in their graves) to treat with her about compofing that 
" difference at Appleby-caltle.
When they came there, fhe ufed them with 
<c all kindnefs and courtefy, but told them plainly fhe would never refer any 
" of her concerns in that kind to the protector or any perfon living, but leave 
*' it wholly to the difcretion of the law ; adding further, that (lie that had re- 
" fufed to fubmit to king James on the like account, would nc/er do it to 
" the protestor, whatever hazard or danger fhe incurred thereby.
" Another inftance of the care (he took to preferve her rights, was as fol- 
" loweth : There had been anciently paid for 400 years continuance, to the 
" cattle of Skipton, 8oj boon hens yearly, and the like to the caftle of 
" Appleby, by the tenants, befides their rents.
One Murgatroyd, a rich.
" clothier of Hallifax, having bought a tenement near Skipton, was to pay 
*' one hen ; which being demanded of him, he abfolutely refufed the payment 
" of it.
Her ladyfhip was refolved not to lofe that hen, being her ancient 
" right, and the lofs of all the reft depending upon that.
Being forced to bring 
â€¢* an action againft him at the affizes at York, (he recovered che hen, though 
" it coft her 200/, and Mr. Murgatroyd as much.
And I believe Sir John 
" Otway and Sir Thomas Stringer got in fees in that caufe 40/ each of 
" them.
" A great eftate God had bleffed her with, and given her withal a noble 
" heart and an open and liberal hand, to do good generally to all.
" A great efteem fhe had for grave divines and learned men, as may ap- 
" pear by thefe three following examples.
Dr. Henry King, late bifhop of 
" Chichefter, had been for fome years chaplain to her firft hufband Richard 
" earl of Dorfet: Upon whole death, he not having any confiderable prefer- 
" ment, this lady fettled a rent charge upon him of 40/ a year, out of her 
" jointure lands in SufTex. The like to Dr. Brian Duppa, who had alfo been 
" her firft lord's domeftic chaplain, who died bifhop of Winchefter.
The 
*' like annuity or rent charge* fhe alfo gave to Dr. George Morley, chaplain to 
" her fecond hufband, who was alfj her godfon, and is now bifhop of Win- 
" chefter.
Many years fhe duly paid thefe rent charges, till in the late cala- 
" mitous times having all taken from them, thefe reverend perfons were forced 
" to go over fea, and hard put to their fliifts to live, fo as they made their 
" application to her ladyfhip to fend them a fum of money in lieu of thefe 
*' rent charges, for their fubfittence abroad ; which fhe willingly confenred 
*' to, and paid 1000/ upon that account, 
" One ftrange and unexampled piece of charity fhe did, which few ladies 
*' would have done.

Tufton is faid to be a corruption of Toketon -f ; for by that name the fa-

The firft that we meet with was Elphege de Toketon, lord of the manor of

OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL.
NO certain derivation of this word hath hitherto been agreed upon.
Without 
having rccourfe to the Roman name Aballaba (which Mr. Horfley doubts 
whether it was the Roman name of this place, but rather thinks this was the 
Roman Galacum) we chufe to adopt a more obvious derivation, by referring it 
the fruit of that name.
And if this place was indeed the Roman Aballaba, yet 
the Romans did not ordinarily impofe new names, but only modified the names 
they 
OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL.
3 o 
they found at the feveral places according to their own idiom.
So that we 
may fuppofe fomething of the like pronunciation had been here before the 
Roman times â€¢, and perhaps we may afcend fo high as the Hebrew tongue for 
its origin.
Appel, abel, afel, is common to the Saxon, Belgic, Danish, and 
other northern languages â€¢, and, by univerfal confent, hath been appropriated 
to particularize the forbidden fruit.
Abel, or as the Hebrews foften it avel, 
(by a tranfmutation frequent in all languages of the letters b, f, and v) digni- 
ties forrow, mourning, and woe.
And it is exactly agreeable to the figurative- 
nefs of that language, to transfer the word to this fruit upon the aforefaid 
confideration.
Our EngliSh-Saxon word evil feems to fpring from the fame 
fource â€¢, and a doer of evil for the fame reafon is contracted into devil.
Malum, 
to fignify an apple, may poflibly have been received into the Latin tongue 
from the like caufe.- â€” The name is not peculiar to this place.
There is an 
Appleby in Derbyfhire, another in Lincolnshire, an Appleby Magna and 
Parva in Leicefterfhire, and others in other places.
So there is Appleihwaite, 
Applegarth, Appleton, and the like, of the fame derivation.
This town was anciently of large extent.
Burr els, or Burr als, which is 
now near a mile distant from the town, means nothing but the borough walls, 
or walls of the burgh or town.
And there have been ruins of buildings plowed 
or dug up at two or three miles distance from the town as it now Stands.
The 
Romans undoubtedly had a ftation here.
But the inscriptions which are to be 
found about the fchool-houfe are not Roman, but copied from Roman infcrip- 
tions in other places by Mr. Bain bridge the fchoolmaSter, and fome of them 
altered according to his own fancy.
This place continued to be considerable long after the Roman times, evea 
until the reign of king Henry the fecond.
But in the 22d year of that king's 
reign, it was furprized by William king of Scots, and utterly destroyed.
But 
he did not keep it long, himfelf being taken prifoner foon after at Alnwick.
King Henry fined Gofpatric fon of Orme (as was obferved before) in the 
fum of 500 marks for delivering it up, and the other officers in other fums 
according to their rank.
And afterwards, in the 12 Ric. 2.
it was fo totally burned down and wafted 
by the Scots, that it was not able fo much as to pay the fee farm rent to the 
crown, and never afterwards in any confiderable degree recovered from that 
fatal overthrow.
Infomuch that by three feveral inquifitions, one in the 7th, 
another in the 25 Hen. 8.
and the third in the 2 and 3 Ph. and Mary, concern- 
ing the arrears of 20 marks ancient rent due to the crown, the jurors find, that 
the town was very much diminished and ruinated, fo that they were wholly in- 
capacitated to pay the faid yearly rent â€¢, that on St. Stephen's day, in the year 
1388, the faid town was burned by the Scots, and from that time had been 
repairing, but that the greatest part dill lay in ruins : Whereupon it was or- 
dered, that inftead of the aforeiaid fum of 2G marks, they Should pay for 
the future no more than two marks or zbs Sd yearly.
And they obtained 
quietus's in the exchequer accordingly.
What 
3to OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL; 
What ftill remains of it is an handiome fmall town, containing between 70 
and 80 families, confiding principally of one broad ftreet, terminated on the 
north by the church, and rifing by an eafy afcent to the caftle on the fouth ; 
with two handfome croiles or obelifks, one at each end.
On the upper crofs 
is this infcription, 
Retain your loyalty.
Preferve your rights.
The fhambles and town hall in the middle of this ftreet greatly incommode 
it.
If thefe were taken away, and removed to more proper places ; the ftreet, 
from its natural fituation and openneis, would be very grand and elegant.
At the upper end of this ftreet as aforefaid ftands the castle aloft; having 
the river Eden underneath it many fathoms perpendicular on the eaft, and on 
the other fides encompaffed with an high wall, and a deep ditch.
There is no doubt but there wis a caftle here in the Roman times.
But 
the greateft part of the building hath been often defaced and broken down, 
in the wars between England and Scotland.
And particularly much hurt v/as 
done thereto by the Scots in the feveral reigns of Richard the fecond and 
Henry the fourth.
After which, in Henry the fixth's time, Thomas lord 
Clifford built the greateft part of it as now ftands, being after the fafhion of 
thofe times.
In the weftern part of this caftle is placed Cafar's tower, which ftands apart 
from the reft of the caftle â€¢, and probably received its name from fome of the 
later emperors.
The aforefaid lady Anne Clifford repaired the fame, and built fair new 
ftables there; and the whole continues in very good condition to this day *.
Appleby hath been a town corporate of very ancient time.
But their 
charter of incorporation is loft; and they are now only a town corporate by 
prefcription.
They have had indeed many charters and renewals thereof, which 
are yet extant ; but thefe are only grants of privileges and immunities, and not 
of incorporation.
King Henry the fecond, upon his reftoring the town, after its deftruction 
by the Scots as aforefaid, granted to them by his charter the fame privileges 
which he had granted to the city of Yorkjuft before f.
For which charter 
they paid into the exchequer the fum of 40 marks.
What 
* Dr. Todd fays, In the year 1641, the lady Anne Clifford fortified this caMe for the king, and 
putting as great a number of foldiers in it as it could contain, gave the government of it to Sir Philip 
Mufgrave, who held it out till after the battle of Marfton Moor, whereby all the northern part of 
England was loft.
In the year [648, Mr. Whitlock (p.
343.) gives an account, that this cattle 
was garrifoned for the king ; and that on the 16th of October in that year it furrendered to the par- 
liament forces, and that therein were taken ; knights, 25 colonels, 9 lieutenant colonels, 6 majors, 
46 captains, 17 lieutenants, 10 cornets, 3 enfigns, and 1200 horfe.

What thofe privileges were, appears from the York charter ; and are the 
very fame which king John afterwards granted fpecially to the town of Apple- 
by, viz.
" a freedom from toll, flallage, pontage, and laftage throughout 
" England, except in the city of London." He granted to them alio the 
borough or town of Appleby, rendring to the fheriff the rent due for the 
fame, one moiety at the feaft of St. Michael, and the other at Eafter *.
There are many Infpeximus's and confirmations of the faid grants by the fuc- 
ceeding princes.
In the 14 Ed. 1.
the king, reciting an Infpeximus in the 16 Hen. 3.
reciting 
the charter of John, confirms the fame, with this addition, " that although 
" they had been wont to pay their fee farm rent by the hands of the fherifF, 
*' they might, if they thought fit, pay the fame into the exchequer by the 
" hands of their own bailiffs." 
In the 5 Ed. 5.
there was another confirmation ; with this claufe, " that 
" whereas king Edward the fecond, in the 5th year of his reign, had taken 
" into his hands the town of Appleby for 60/ in arrear of their fee farm rent; 
" the now king Edward the third, in confideration of the fine by them paid 
" to him on that account, reftores the town to them, to hold by the faid farm 
" as aforefaid." 
In the 3 Cha. 1.
there is another confirmation; reciting a charter of James 
the firft, another of Elizabeth, another of Henry the eighth, which recited 
the charters of Edward the firft, Henry the third, and king John ; and con- 
firming the fame.

But thefe are only ftill confirmations of the aforefaid privileges of freedom 
from tolls, ftallage, pontage, and laftage â€¢, and not at all any grant of in- 
corporation.
Yet notwithstanding, it is in fa6b evident, that they were governed by a 
mayor and other corporation officers, perhaps as early as any other corporation 
in the kingdom.
In the reign of king Henry the third, a leafe of lands at Appleby, by the 
- abbot and convent of Wederhale to Robert fon of Godfrey, was for the greater 
notoriety publifhed in the county court, and in the chapter, and in the burg- 
mote of Appleby â€¢, and fealed (amongft others) with the feals of John de Ve- 
teripont, of Walter de Ulvefby official, and the common feal of the burgefjes of 
Appleby *.
Which faid John de Veteripont died about the 26th year of that 
king's reign, viz.
in 1241.
By a deed without date, Richard de Apelby clerk granted to Robert fon of 
the faid John de Veteripont (which Robert died before the end of that king's 
reign) a meffuage in the town of Apelby, between the mefTuages of Robert 
de Goldington and Emma daughter of Barnard : To hold of Idonea daughter 
of John fon of Thomas, to him and his heirs for ever â€¢, rendring for the fame

In the 6 Ed. 1.
before the juflices itinerant in Cumberland, there was an 
agreement between the mayor of Appleby, claiming to be " quit from paying 
*' toll throughout England by charter except within the city of London," and 
Thomas fon of Lambert de Multon ; whereby the faid Thomas granted 
for himfelf and his heirs, that the townfmen of Appleby aforefaid mould be 
quit of toll, ferryings [tranfverfagiis], ftallage, and other mercantile charges 
within his liberty of Egremond f.

From all which it is clear, that there was a mayor of Appleby of very an- 
cient time.
And this folves a queflion which hath fometimes been made, 
whether (amongft other things) the mayor by the charter of incorporation had 
the power given to him of a juftice of the peace.
That office was not infti- 
tuted till the reign of Edward the third.
In the firft year of Edward the third, 
power was given to the crown to appoint keepers of the peace.

and 1 8th of Ed. 3.
(as fome fuch there are) conferred upon the mayor or 
others the power of keeping the peace, and no more.
After the 18 Ed. 3.
the king granted by charter the power a!fo to hear and determine, which ever 
fince hath been annexed to the office of jufticcs of the peace.
So that what 
power the mayor of Appleby may have in this refpecl:, muft have been granted 
fince the 18th of Edward the third.
The town of Appleby being granted to the burghers as aforefaid by king 
John in the firft year of his reign ; the faid king afterwards granted (as hath 
been fet forth) to Robert de Veteripont Appleby and Brough, together with 
the fheriffwick and rent of the county of Weftmorland.
Which grant to Ro- 
bert de Veteripont being fubfequent to the grant to the burghers, hereby it 
came to pafs, that neither the borough nor the fervices thereof pafiTed to 
Robert de Veteripont.
Yet in refpecl: of the general words of the Veteri- 
pont charter, which would have parted the borough, if the fame had not been 
before granted to the burgefTes, the Veteriponts (we find) made claim to the 
fervices of the borough.
In the 4 Ed. 1.
the burgefTes of Appleby brought a 
fpecial writ againft Roger de Clifford and Ifabella his wife and Roger de La- 
burne and Idonea his wife, reciting, that whereas the forefaid burghers are 
tenants of our lord the king, and hold nothing of the aforefaid Roger and 
Ifabella, Roger and Idonea, the aforefaid Roger and Roger do not permit the 
faid burghers to grind their corn at fuch mills as they fhall judge mod con- 
venient for them to make choice and ufe of, nor permit them to take flail- 
rent in all markets and fairs at the faid town, nor cufloms of fuch merchants 
as traffick there, as they and their anceftors in time pafl were accuflomed to 
do â€¢, and diftrain them day by day to compel them to do fealty to the faid 
Roger and Roger for their tenements in the town aforefaid as if they were 
their homagers, of whom they hold not any thing at all, nor of any other but 
our lord the king â€¢, to the great damage of our lord the king and the afore- 
faid burghers.
And Roger and Ifabella, Roger and Idonea, by the attorney 
of the faid Ifabella and Idonea, appeared, and freely acknowleged, that they 
do require fealty of the aforefaid burghers, for their tenements in the town 
aforefaid ; for they fay, that the aforefaid burghers hold of them, and not of 
our lord the king; for they affirm, that king John, grandfather of our now 
lord the king, gave the aforefaid town of Appleby to one Robert de Veteri- 
pont, great grandfather of the faid Ifabella and Idonea, whofe heirs they are, 
by a certain charter which they produce â€¢, and which doth teftify, that the 
aforefaid king gave to the faid Robert, Appleby and Burgh under Stanemore, 
wi:h the fervices of all his free tenants in Weftmorland, excepting thofe who 
hold by knights fervice : And they fay, that the aforefaid Robert and all his 
heirs fucceffively, from the time of making the aforefaid charter, were in feifin 
of the fealty of the burgh of Appleby, by the tenants which hold in the afore- 
faid village, as lords of the village aforefaid.
And the faid burghers, for our 
lord the king, fay, that whatever charter the faid Roger and Roger produce 
under the name of the faid king John, the faid Robert anceftor of the faid 
Ifabella and Idonea never by the faid charter did obtain any feifin of the bo- 
rough of Appleby, nor his heirs fucceeding him had any right or lordfhip

OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL.
in the aforefaid borough, but that the burghers aforefaid were anfwerable to 
our lord the king, and never did fealty to the faid Robert or his heirs by reafon 
of their tenements : But they fay, that whereas they hold the faid borough of 
our lord the king at the fee farm rent of 20 marks yearly to be paid, they 
and their anceftors have done fealty to the faid Robert de Veteripont and his 
heirs, by four burghers, by the community of the faid town to this chofen 
and (worn, to anfwer to the faid Robert and bis heirs, as (heriffs, and not as 
lords of the aforefaid borough ; and if they have done to them any other fealty, 
it was by diftrefs, and not of right.
And thereupon iffue is joined.
And be- 
caufe the faid Roger and Roger are fheriffs of Weftmorland in fee, whereupon 
the knights and freeholders of the faid county are fufpected, therefore it is 
ordered by the court, that inquiry be made of the premifTes by jurors of the 
counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and York : who find, that neither 
Robert de Veteripont, nor any that fucceeded him as heir, ever had feifinof the 
borough of Appleby in which the burghers dwell, but that king John gave to 
the faid Robert Old Appilby where the Bondmen dwell [Fetus Appilby ubi Villani 
manent\ and Burgh under Stanemore, with the appurtenances; which lands 
king John had in his hands, by reafon of the trefpafs committed by Hugh de 
Moreville : They find alfo, that the faid king John gave to the faid Robert 
the iheriffwick and rent of the county of Weftmorland, with the fervices there 
of all the tenants of the king, except thofe that hold by knights fervice: And 
as to the fealty done to the laid Robert and his heirs by the burghers of Ap- 
pilby for the faid borough, they find, that the fame burghers never did fealty 
to the faid Robert or his heirs for the faid borough, except by two bailiffs 
chofen by the community of the faid borough, foas to be refponfible to him for 
the rent of the faid borough, as fheriff in fee, and not as lord of the bo- 
rough : They find alfo, that if the faid burghers at any time have done any 
fealty to them, it was by diftreffes and force, and not by their will.
And 
judgment was given for the butgeffes plaintiffs, againft the defendants *.
â€” 
And this perhaps might be the reafon of fpecially inferting in their next char- 
ter (as hath been fhewed) that they may pay the faid rent either to the fherifF 
for the ufe of the king, or immediately into the exchequer.
The town having obtained fuccefs in the conteft touching their tenure, 
thought alfo to have fet on foot a title by franchifes, which belonged to the 
fheriffs in point of jurifdi<ftion ; as, the returns of writs, and pleas of Wither- 
nam.
Whereupon in the 7 Ed. 1.
the burghers of Appleby come and pre- 
fent, that king John gave them fuch liberties as the citizens of York; and 
that the faid king John gave to Robert de Veteripont the fheriffwick of Weft- 
morland, who firft hindred the burgeffes to ufe returns of writs and pleas of 
Withernam : and in purfuance of that claim, in the 14 Ed. 1.
the fheriff of 
Weftmorland was commanded to permit them to have returns of all the king's 
writs, and to make fummons and attachments, and that he fhould make re- 
turns to the burgeffes of writs to be executed in that town.
The fheriff ap- 
peared and averred, that the bailiffs of that town never had returns of writs.

OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL.
But the bailiff's appeared not to avouch their franchifes, and thereupon they 
were amerced.
After this again, on the other hand, the fheriffs began to queftion the bur- 
geffes.
For in the 15 Ed. 1.
Ifabella and Idonea fued William de Goldington, 
John his brother, Thomas Brayton, and other burgeffes of Appleby, for that 
whereas attachments, appeals of death, and other felonies, ought to be fued 
before the king's juftices by writs, or before the fheriff and coroners in the 
county court, the defendants held appeal againft John de Apulby for the 
death of Nicholas Strainge, and caufed him thereupon to be attached and 
imprifoned ; and though Ifabella, as fheriff of Westmorland, had come per- 
fonally and brought the king's writ of fuperfedeas, yet the bailiffs held their 
court of Appleby : And this they declare, to their damage of 1000/.
The 
defendants appear, but could not defend it.
And judgment was given for the 
plaintiffs; and the town's liberty feized, and aftewards replevied.
So much of their ancient grants and charters- 
In the time of Oliver Cromwell, they feem to have had a charter impofed 
upon them, reftriftive probably of their former privileges â€¢, for they had been 
firm in their attachment to the royal caufe.
To which purpofe the reverend 
Thomas Machel, fpeaking of the plunderings and devaftations which Appleby 
had fuftained in former ages, adds, " And if you feek for a later inftance, 
" you may find one in the height of Cromwell's tyranny â€¢, for when thofe 
bloody regicides, which made the very name of an Englishman odious in the 
world, were not content to bury their malice with that moft pious and inno- 
cent king whom they moft barbaroufly murdered, but would farther proceed 
to profcribe his lbn and proclaim their lord and fovereign a traytor, no man 
there (either by reward or threaming) could be induced to aÂ£t or to appear 
" in fo horrid a villainy.
The mayor withdrew himfelf, and the bailiffs 
" (whofe office it was) threw up their commiffions, though but poor men, 
*' infomuch that the foldiers were glad to have recourfe unco a fellow in the 
market, an unclean bird, hatched at Kirkby Stephen, the neft of all tray- 
tors, who proclaimed it aloud, whilft the people (topped their ears and 
hearts, having nothing open but their eyes, and thofe even filed with tears.
What fhould I fpeak of thofe perpetual persecutions which the neighbour- 
" ing gentlemen, who are aldermen of the town, underwent for their loyalty to 
" the king ?
I think I need no other argument both for their acting for the 
" king and their faithful perfeverance, than their conftant fuffi-rings, fequeftra-

And though Oliver, through captain Atkinfon's means, in order 
44 to make himfelf more abiblute, gave a charter to this ancient corporation, 
tl which was rather impoied than accepted of, yet they preferved their old 
44 one to the laft.
And when the firft gentleman, whofe name 1 neither need

44 cepted the place on the king's return, he would not handle the ftaff of au- 
44 thority, nor fuffer the oath of office to be adminiftred unto him, till he had

44 his own hands, and then looking about he efpied fome taylors, and caft it to.

44 pomp and folemnity (the like whereof was never feen in thofe parts) upon 
44 his coronation, when there were almoft as many bonefires as houfes, and two

44 gold â€¢, whither, after fervice done at the church, the countefs of Pembroke, 
44 with the mayor, aldermen, and all the other gentry of the county afcended, 
44 with I know not how many trumpets, and an imperial crown carried be- 
44 fore them, where they proclaimed, prayed for, and drank the health of the 
44 king upon their knees ; the aged countefs feeming young again to grace the 
44 folemnity.
The expences of that day were very confiderable.
For through- 
44 out the town was kept open houfe, after the example of that noble coun- 
44 tefs, who thought not her gates then wide enough to receive her guefts, 
44 which before had been too wide for receiving armies of foldiers.'* 
Finally, whatever charters had before been granted to this corporation, as 
fuch, were (amongft many others throughout the kingdom) furrendered to 
king James the fecond, and were then loft, or have not fince been heard of.
And the faid king James, July 3d, in the firft year of his reign, incorporated 
them de novo ; letting forth, that whereas they had furrendered to him all 
their franchifes and liberties concerning the electing and appointing of perfons 
to the offices of mayor, recorder, aldermen, common council, coroner, fer- 
jeanr, fword-bearer, bailiffs, and chamberlains of the corporation, he there- 
fore grants to them that they fhall be a body corporate, by the name of mayor, 
aldermen, and capital burgefles of the borough of Appleby ; that one of the 
burghers fhall be mayor, that there fhall be a recorder, that twelve of the 
burgefTes (befides the mayor) fhall be aldermen, that fixteen of the capital

aldermen to be his deputy.
The recorder alfo may appoint a deputy during 
his pleafure.
With a power referved to the king, to difplace any of thefe at 
his pleafure.
He grants them a fair on the fecond Thurfday in April, to con- 
tinue for two days, at any convenient place within the borough or the liberties 
or precincts thereof.
Pie grants to them courts leet, view of frankpledge, 
fairs, markets, waifs, eflray, deodands, goods of felons and fugitives, felons 
de fe, of perfons put in exigent and outlawed, and all other things as they had 
formerly enjoyed ; paying the farm to the.
king as heretofore.
With a re- 
ftrictive claufe, that neither the mayor, aldermen, nor any of the burgefies 
(hall interrupt or moleft any of the king's juflices, fheriff, or other bailiffs or 
miniflers within their borough.
About two years after this, the king ifilied a Quo warranto againft this 
amongfb other corporations ; who being not willing to difpute a title with the 
king, though they had received their charter from himfelf fo lately before, 
refolved to return it, which they did on the 4th of June 1688, under their 
common feal, to the effect following ; " We the mayor, aldermen, and ca- 
" pital burgefles of the borough of Appleby in the county of Weflmorland, 
li in all humble obedience to his majefly, do by thefe prefents grant, furren- 
" der, and yield up, to the king, his heirs and fuccefibrs, all the powers,

*' for the government of the laid borough, and with fuch refervations, re- 
f* ftrictions, and qualifications, as his majefty fhall be pleafed to appoint." 
No further charter was ever granted.
But the faid king by his proclama- 
tion, for reftoring corporations to their ancient charters, bearing date Oct. 17, 
1688*, declares, that the refignation of this (amongft many other charters) 
was never inrolled, and confequently the refignation was void ; and if fo, the 
charter fo far flood good.
But then the fame declaration extends to the former 
furrender likewife, that the faid former furrender was alfo never inrolled.
And 
it feemeth to be holden (as we have fpoken more at large in treating of the 
Kendal charter) that a charter granted in confideration of a void furrender is 
alfo void.
And the confequence of all this will be, that the borough of

3-8 OF APPLEBY IN GENERAL.
Appleby fubfifts as an ancient corporation by prefcription, without any known 
written charter now in force.
And in virtue of this prefcriptive right, the corporation at prefent confifts 
of a mayor, twelve aldermen, a recorder, fixteen common councilmen with 
a fword-bearer and ferjeant at mace, two chamberlains, and other officers.
The common council chufe the mayor, and the mayor chufes all his officers.
They have power to arreft for any fum without limitation : To acknowledge 
flatutes merchant before the mayor : To take toll both in fairs and markets : 
To feize felons goods, waifs, eftrays, forfeitures, and efcheats.
All which 
belong to the mayor.
He takes place, by immemorial cuftom, of the judges 
of alTize : Which may have arifen poffibly from the contefts as above men- 
tioned between the fheriff and the town â€¢, and this may be one reafon perhaps, 
why the owners of the caftle do not feem to have exerted themfelves at any 
time, to procure for the corporation a charter from the crown, with fuller and 
more explicit powers and privileges.
Their arms, according to Mr. Bloome, are, Gules, three crowned lions 
paffant guardant Or. The creft, in a coronet a falamander Proper.
The fup- 
porters, two dragons Gules.
Motto, Nee ferro nee igni.
Their common feal has on one fide in an antique fhield the arms aforefaid, 
viz.
three cowned lions paffant guardant, in pale.
The fhield is embellifhed 
with branches and apples thereon (which, by the way, agrees with our deri- 
vation of the name of this place).
The legend round is, Sigillum communi- 
tatis burgi de Appilby : And on the reverfe, Sc. Laurence laid at length naked, 
with his hands acrofs, on a gridiron ; which is fupported by two perfons at 
each end, the one covered, the other uncovered.
Underneath the gridiron is 
a reprefemation of burning coals.
Above, appears a banner difplayed, to- 
wards the head, bearing the arms of the borough-, towards the feet, is an 
angel, receiving in a fheet or cloth a fmall figure reprenting the head and 
uplifted hands of St. Laurence.
The legend round is Hicjacet Laurencius in 
craticula pnfitus.
They have alfo a fmall feal, which reprefents the virgin Mary crowned, fit- 
ting on a throne, with the child Jefus at her bread.
Underneath the throne is 
a figure in a fuppliant pofture, with hands and face uplifted.
The legend 
round is, Sigillum commune beat<e Maria virginis de Appelby.
â€” This feems to 
have been one of the chantry feals; for there was a chantry of St. Mary both 
in the church of St. Laurence and the church of St. Michael.
Befides theie, the mayor has a fmall feal, for adls which he may fingly do 
as mayor.
This borough fends two members to parliament *.
The assizes for the county are held at this town, as is natural to fuppofe ;

time immemorial have been entertained there at the expence of the fherifT; 
which might perhaps fpring originally from the hofpitality of the noble family 
of the Cliffords.
The sessions of the peace are alfo held at this place.
In former times, 
there were difputes between the juftices refiding in the bottom of Weftrnor- 
land, and thole refiding in the barony of Kendal ; thefe latter thinking it hard 
to travel fo far as Appleby to a quarter feffion : And each of them proclaimed 
fefiions to be held in their refpective parts of the county.
To prevent which 
confufion, it was referred to the judges of afiize in the year 1676, who recom- 
mended, and it hath been the rule ever fince, that the juftices fhall meet at 
Appleby on Monday in the fefiions week, and fummon juries in the bottom 
for matters arifing there-, and then adjourn to Kendal on Friday in the fame 
week, and fummon juries in the barony for matters arifing there : And that 
at Midfummer, when the days are long, they fhall hold their feffion alter- 
nately at Appleby and Kendal for the whole county, on Tuefday (that no 
perfon need to travel on Sunday to go to the fefiions); and fhall fummon half 
the jury or juries out of the bottom and half out of the barony ; and that this 
being for the whole county, there fhall then be no adjournment.
At the weft end of the bridge ftands the old gaol-, a little, mean, incom- 
modious building; without one inch of ground out of doors, wherein the 
prifoners might receive frefh air.
Though the prifons of ancient times were 
generally in the caftles, yet this gaol, from the monkifh infcription over the 
door, feems not to be very modern ; viz.
" Porta patens efto nulli claudatur honefto." 
Now lately, viz.
in the year 1771, hath been erected on the other fide of 
the river a new gaol, with a yard, and other conveniences ; which, when 
finifhed, will be a much more comfortable habitation than the former to the 
miferable inhabitants.
And adjoining hereunto, new court houfes are intended 
to be erected, wherein to hold the affizes and fefiions.
At the eaft end of the bridge ftands the house of correction, tolerably 
convenient for the purpofe: with a garden backwards towards the river.
Towards the high end of the town, on the eaft fide, in an healthy and plea- 
fant fituation, ftands an hospital for 12 widows and a mother, founded by 
Anne countefs of Pembroke in the year 1653.
In her ftatutes for governing the fame, which bear date on May 16th in that 
year, it is ordered, that prayers be faid duly every morning in the chapel of 
the hofpital by the vicar of Appleby : The doors of the hofpital to be fhut 
every night at 8 in the winter, and 9 in the fummer, and not opened till 7 in 
the morning in winter, and 6 in the fummer: The court to be fvvept once in 
every week, and the kennels and watercourfes about it to be kept clean : If 
any difference arife among them, the fame to be determined by the major part

of themfelves and the vicar-, and if they cannot end it, then to be referred to 
the owner of the caftle and the mayor of the corporation.
For maintenance of the faid hofpital, fhe purchafed the manor of Brougham, 
and the late diffolved hofpital of St. Nicholas nigh Appleby â€¢, and by deed 
bearing date Mar. 27, 1654, between the faid countefs of the one part, and 
Sir Charles Howard, Sir Francis Howard, Sir Philip Mufgrave, Sir John 
Lowther, Sir William Townfhend, Sir George Fletcher, Sir Thomas Sand- 
ford, Chriftopher Lifter, Robert Hilton, and the mayor of Appleby for the 
time being, of the other part, reciting, that whereas (he had built an hofpital 
at Appleby for 13 poor women, and had purchafed certain lands in Brougham 
and St. Nicholas, of the yearly value of about 100/, which (he is refolved to 
fettle not only for the maintenance of the faid poor women, but alfo for the 
yearly payment of 4/ to the poor of the parifh of Brougham, fhe therefore 
grants to the faid Charles Howard and the other truftees, all that the late dif- 
folved hofpital of St. Nicholas, and all that the manor and lordfhip of 
Brougham, in truft, to pay to each of the faid poor widows refident in the faid 
hofpital (except the mother) 6/ a year, and to the mother 8/, and 8/ yearly 
to the parfon of Appleby in cafe he officiate every day in the week (except 
Sunday) in the chapel of the faid hofpital, otherwife to fuch perfon as the heirs 
of the faid countefs lords of the caftle and manor of Appleby fhall appoint fo 
to officiate.
The refidue to be kept in bank, for repairing the houfe, and 
defraying the charges of the truftees.
When 8 of the truftees fhall be dead, 
the furvivors to convey to other ten perfons of worth and quality inhabiting in 
the faid county, to be nominated by the heirs of the faid countefs lords of the 
caftle and manor of Appleby, or by their guardians in cafe of minority; and 
in default thereof for the fpace of 6 months, then the furvivors or major part 
of them to make election both of feoffees, widows, mother, and chaplain, 
and fo toties quo ties.
About 8 years after this, viz.
in 1661, the faid countefs (having difdained, 
as it feemeth, to apply to the Protector) obtained from king Charles the fe- 
cond letters patent for eftablifhing the faid hofpital, by the name of the hofpital 
of St. Anne of Appleby : The countefs to name the firft mother and fifters ; 
and afterwards, upon the death, or expulfion for any crime or caufe, of any 
of them, the faid countefs and her heirs, lords of the caftle and manor of Ap- 
pleby, to appoint another: And they alfo to be vifitors of the faid hofpital, 
and have power to correct and expel for immorality or other caufe â€¢, and, with 
the confent of the lord chancellor, or of the archbifhop of York for the time 
being, to have power to make ftatutes for the government of the faid hofpital, 
and difpofition of the lands, goods, and revenues thereof; the faid revenues 
not to exceed the fum of 100/ yearly.
In the year 1687, J u ty 6tn > Thomas earl of Thanet, by writing under his 
hand and leal, (by virtue, as it feemeth, of his vifitatorial power as aforefaid) 
reciting that great abufe had been practifed in the hofpital, as well in fharing 
amongft the mother and fifters the 6 / a year appointed for the repair of the 
houfe [being part of the aforefaid furplus, which was then 8 / a year], as

to be accounted part of the public money of the faid hofpital, for providing 
a ftock to be ufed on emergent occafions, â€” orders, that luch houfe and va- 
cancy money be put into a cLeft for fuch public ufe, and no part be made ufe 
of without the direction of himlelf, his heirs, or their fteward or receiver at 
Appleby caftle; and that a yearly account be made thereof, and allowed and 
figned by the fteward.
Here is a good market every Saturday, for corn and other provifions j 
and a fair yearly on St. Laurence's day.
And alfo a fair every Whitfun-eve 
and Whitfun-monday ; and on the Saturday every fortnight for cattle from 
Whitfun-eve till Michaelmafs.
And alfo king James the fecond's fair is held 
on the fecond Thurfday in April and the day following.
At the entrance of the churchyard, there is a convenient and decent market 
houfe or cloifter-, which fronts to the market place, and was built chiefly at 
the expence of Dr. Thomas Smith bifhop of Carlifle ; unto which alfo Dr.
Barlow bifhop of Lincoln gave 10/.
For this, the corporation pays a rent of 
5 j yearly to the vicar, in confideration that part of the faid building was 
erected upon the churchyard.
In the year 1598, the market was removed to Gilfhaughlin, on account of 
the plague-, in which year, between Aug. 1.
and Mar. 25.
there died in Ap-

OF THE PARISH OF ST.
LAURENCE IN APPLEBY.
A Ppleby is divided into two parifhes ; of St. Laurence^ and St. Michael.
â€¢*"^ The parifh of St. Laurence is bounded on the Eaft by St. Michael's, 
commonly called Bongate parilh j on the South-eaft and South, by Ormefhead 
and Afby parifhes ; on the Weft, by Crofby Ravenfvvorth and Morland pa- 
rifhes ; and on the North, by the faid parifhes of Morland and St. Michael's: 
And contains in the whole about 160 families, all of the church of 
England.
The church (as the name imports) was dedicated to St. Laurence ; which 
was the original of the fair at Appleby on that faint's day, and the fame feaft 
of St. Laurence is for the like reafon in ancient writings appointed for the 
payment of rents in places thereabouts.
It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at 9/ 5J i\d.
It was given by Ranulph de Mefchines, as is aforefaid, together with the 
church of St. Michael, to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York;

Afterwards the fame was confirmed by Athelwald firft bifhop of Carlifle ;

town was taken by the king of Scots â€¢, and rebuilt, by the faid king Henry, 
a is fuppofed, about two ;, sstrs after.
In the year 1655, the fame being much in decay, the lady Anne Clifford 
at her own expence took down all the timber, and the walis of moft part of 
the chancel, where a veftry was heretofore, and rebuilt the fame without one ; 
and inftead thereof, a veftry was taken out of the weft end of the church.
A

In the infide of this chuich, at the fovih end of the communion table, is a

" Herelyeth interred the body of the lady Margaret Ruficl, countefs dowa-

rents and profits of the faid eftate (which was then let at 61 a year) to be em- 
ployed by the mayor, with the confent of the other truftees or four of them, 
for the repairing and decent keeping the tomb in the quire of the church at 
Appleby, where her faid mother lies interred, and one other tomb which fhe 
the faid countefs was then preparing to be fet up for herfelf ; and for the repair 
of the grammar fchool houfe, and the moot hail or court houfe, both in and 
belonging to Appleby aforefaid â€¢, and likewife for the repair of Appleby bridge.
On the death of truftees, the furvivors to chufe others.
Belonging to the church of St Laurence were anciently two chantries.
1. The chantry of the blejfed virgin Mary ; founded by the family of Gold- 
ington, and endowed by them with revenues in the town and elfewhere, for 
celebrating divine fervice at the altar of St. Mary in the church aforefaid, for 
the mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty, and for the fouls of the founders and 
their anceftors, and all faithful people, and efpeciaily of thofe who fhould be 
in any wife benefactors to the laid chantry.
in the 14 Ed. 1.
hce is a deed or confirmation from Ralph de Irton bifhop 
of Carlifie and John de Goldington â€¢, from whence it appears, that there were 
divers rents affigned for the maintenance of a chantry prieft in the church of 
St. Laurence, charged upon 15 perfons by name, which were to be as a fe- 
curity for raifing ig marks yearly : If thcie fhould not be fufficient, then he 
charges other rents on the houfes of 1 3 other perfons.

lady in Appleby, and Robert Langhorne, Thomas Sowerby, John Warthe- 
cupp, and Robert Smith, for themfelves and all the refidue of the faid Sir 
John's tenants in the town of Appleby, of the one part, and John Barton 
efquire lord of the manor of Ormfide, of the other part ; the fame was refer- 
*red to the arbitration of Sir William Stowe, knight, and commander of the 
mount of St. John, Sir Robert Lowther of Lowther knighr, Richard Rift- 
wald of Appleby gentleman, and Rowland Barton of Newcastle upon Tyne 
clerk : Who awarded, that the faid Sir John's tenants in Appleby fhall have 
eafment and liberty of driving their kine (but no other cattle) with a herd, at 
noon time, during the fummer feafon only, over the v\eft end of Braidmyre 
fike, and fo over Braidmyre to Rutter-beck; and the faid herd to drive them 
within the compafs of a (hot of a burdbolt of the Birk-hill dike ; and the faid 
kine to ftay in the faid Rutter-beck, until the faid herd might fet two fpecks 
on his ihoes ; and then to drive them back again the fame way : and the faid 
tenants to pay for the fame, on the fcaft of St. Dunftan yearly, for every 
cow id.
* 
About 2 years after, the faid John Barton efquire made a rental for the 
Watergate of the cows of the tenants in Appleby ; by which it appears, that 
the number of tenants was 77, and the number of cows 95.
-f- 
2. The other chantry in the church of St. Laurence was founded by Robert 
Tbrelkeld, by the name of the chantry of St. Nicholas ; and endowed alfo with 
feveral burgage houfes in Appleby.
In the 4 Ed. 3.
there was a licence from bifhop Rofs to Robert Threlkeld 
to aliene in mortmain, with an Infpeximus of letters- patent of the faid king 
granting licence of alienation to the faid Robert of lands in Appleby of the 
yearly value of 3 / 4 s yd, which he held of the king in burgage by the farm 
of 2 J 10 d, which farm is called Danegeld : As appears by inquifition taken 
by John de Lowther efcheator general in the northern parts.
J 
Befides this chantry of St. Nicholas, there was alfo an hofpital of St. Nicholas 
in the parifh of St. Michael j as will appear in its place.
There was alfo a chapel in Appleby, as appears by a deed in the 23 Hen. 6.
whereby Robert Warcop, mayor, and the burgeffes of Appleby, granted to 
John Marlhall chaplain, a certain ruinated chapel upon the weft end of the 
Ilone bridge of St. Laurence in Appleby ; to hold the faid chapel to the faid 
John and his fucceffors.
The faid John to repair the faid chapel at his own 
expence.
They grant alfo a licence to him to repair a certain chamber or 
oratory over the faid chapel.
To pay a yearly rent of 2 d to the mayor and 
burgeffes, if demanded ||.
This feems to be the very fame which is now 
the old gaol ; having to this day much more the appearance of a monkifh cell 
than a prifon.
The revenues thereof perhaps did arife from the charity of 
paffengers.

The mention of the chantries naturally introduces the account of the school.
The fchool, as now eftablilhed, is not ancienter than the reign of queen Eli- 
zabeth : But there was fome kind of a fchool before.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
John Marfhall, vicar of St. Michael's, fo'd to Thomas 
lord Clifford a burgage houfe in Appleby, defcribed to be on the weft fide of 
the ftreet called Kirkgate, extending in length to a certain narrow lane called 
School hcuje gate.
The chantries fometimes were given all to one perfon, in confideration of 
his teaching fchool.
It was probably upon this account, that in the 19 Ed. 4.
the mayor and burgeffes granted (as appears by their deed) to Thomas Whin- 
fell chaplain, the chantry of the bleffed virgin Mary, which Thomas de Gold- 
ington and John his fon and their anceftors had founded in the church of St.
Laurence â€¢, together with the chantry of St. Nicholas in the faid church ; and

covenanted to officiate and teach fchool; the faid chaplain to have alfo the 
orchard and all the fruits of it, with hay to feed an horfe.
And more fully, by indenture in the 10 Hen. 8.
June 6, 1518, the mayor, 
bailiffs, and commonalty of the borough of our lord the king of Appleby in 
the county of Weftmorland grant unto Leonard Langhorne the chantry of the 
bleffed virgin Mary in the church of St. Laurence in the borough aforefaid, 
with all the lands, tenements, rents and fervices thereto belonging â€¢, to have 
and to hold the fame during his life, to celebrate divine fervice at the altar of 
St. Mary in the church aforefaid, according to the rules of the eftablifhment 
and foundation of the faid chantry : And further, confidering that the faid 
chantry is not fufficient for the fuftenance of one chaplain-, they give him 
power to hold two other chantries, namely, the chantry of St. Nicholas in the 
faid church of St. Laurence, and the chantry late of William Inglifh in the 
church of St. Michael in Appleby aforefaid.
On the other part, the faid 
Leonard Langhorne covenants to teach one grammar fchool in the borough, 
aforefaid, during the time that he fhall enjoy the faid chantries.
It is further 
covenanted, that in cafe of ficknefs or infirmity or pilgrimage, they (hall ex- 
cufe his attendance on the faid fchool during fuch time.
And if it happen 
that the tenements or rents of the faid chantry of St. Mary, by the wars of the 
Scots or other misfortunes, be wafted or dilapidated ; then the faid Leonard

head matter of the fchool.
"Which, together with the wall about the court or 
garden wherein the houie ftands, was built in the fame year, and the overplus 
of the charges above the faid 40/ was jointly paid by the faid Dr. Smith and 
Mr. Sanderlbn.
In the year 1676, the faid Mr. Sanderfon gave 30/, to be expended in 
phnking the floor of the fchool, renewing the tables and feats, inlarging the 
windows on the back fide of the fchool, and deling the chambers in the firtt 
loft.
In 1684, the governors pnrchafed the demefne lands of New-hall within 
the manor of Sandford, with fome fmall tenements thereto belonging, of 
Thomas Warcop and his fon George, for 500/, being part of the faid bene- 
factions.
The abovefaid agreement, whereby the governors transfer to the college 
their right of nominating a fchoolmafter, is undoubtedly void in law.
But it 
is fo manifeftly for the advantage of the fchool and neighbourhood, that it 
feems to have been thought unneceffary to be at the expence of an act of par- 
liament to confirm it.
Elections by a number of feoffees or the like are fre- 
quently controuled by fome leading perfon, and more efpecially in parliamen- 
tary boroughs, where merit is not always the principal thing regarded ; for 
there are other ends to ferve.
And we need go no further perhaps for anv 
example, than this inftance before us.
For notwithftanding that queen Eliza- 
beth by the charter of foundation had appointed all the ten governors of the 
fchool to be chofen out of the inhabitants or freeholders, that is, perfons who 
have a freehold eftate \de inhahitantibus vel liberis tenentibus] in the town of 
Appleby â€¢, yet at the time of this agreement, we find four of the governors 
(firft named) not inhabiting within the town, and (fo far as appears from a lift 
of the burghers taken upon the occafion of an election of members of parlia- 
ment not long after) three of them having not then any eftate in the town, and 
the fourth not fo much as would make a vote,, having only what they called 
half a burgage.
And the fchool, it feems, was conducted accordingly: for 
they gave the fchoolmafter Sol to refign.
And into his p!ace was elected Mr.
Richard Jack/on, fchoolmafter of Kendal, who had before been fchoolmafter 
of Bampton-, one of the moft eminent teachers of his time.
He was fucceeded by Jonathan Banks, B.
A. in 1686, nominated by the 
college-, on whofe death in 1721, Thomas Nevinfon, M.
A. fucceeded on the 
like nomination.
On the ceffion of Mr. Nevinfon, fucceeded the prefent fchoolmafter Richard 
Tales, M.
A. nominated alfo by the college â€¢, who hath executed that office 
for the fpace of 50 years *, with honour, ability, affiduity, and learning-, who 
hath inftructed two generations of gentlemen and others, not only in the town 
and neighbourhood, but from many other parts of the kingdom ; and fur- 
nifhed during that time near half the foundation of Queen's college aforefaid ; 
who, together with claffical precepts, hath been always felicitous, by his 
example and every method of initruction, to recommend the practice of virtue 
and religion.

COLBY.
Defcending from Appleby towards the weft, at about a mile's diftance, we 
arrive at the village of Colby.
It appears to have been held of ancient time by a family of the name de 
Colby^ and from them to have come by an heirefs to the family of Warcop.
In the 22 Hen. 2.
we find one William de Colby ^ who was one of thofe of- 
ficers that were fined by the faid king, for delivering up Appleby caftle to 
the king of Scots.
Which William feems to be the fame who in the regifter 
of Wetheral priory is ftyled William de Breton lord of Colleby^ who in the faid

Thomas Warcop of Colby and Barnaby his fon and heir 
apparent, exchanged a tenement in Colby for lands elfewhere.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, Barnaby Warcopp held the faid manor *.
In Mr. Machel's time, in the reign of king Charles the fecond, there was 
one Thomas Warcop of Colby gentleman, who (he fays) was the principal of 
the family, but it was then gone to decay.
He had 22 children ; but the

Turning Southward from Colby, we come to the demefne and hall of 
Berw,se.
In the reign of king Henry the third, we find one Alan de Berwys, 
a man of considerable note.
He was one of the witnefles to a charter of John 
de Veteripont to the inhabitants of Kirkby Thore, to be free from the demands 
of the foreiters.
And he was one of the jurors to inquire concerning the wafte 
committed by the prior of Carlifle in the lands late of the faid John, during 
the minority and wardfhip of his fon.
In the 40th year of the faid king, Thomas Vipont, bifliop of Carlifle, by 
virtue of a mandate from pope Alexander the 4th, granted to this Alan de 
Berwys, by reafon of his dittance from the parilh church, and inundations in 
the winter feafon, a licence to build a chapel on his own ground there ; and 
he was to endow the fame, and might receive benefactions for the fame alfo 
from others : The chaplain to take an oath of obedience to the vicar of the 
.mother church.
He feems to have had feveral fons.
To one of them, Alan, he gave all his 
lands in Slegill -, whofe defcendents continued there for five generations.
"John de Berewyfe and Henry his brother, who feem to have been other two 
fons, were witnefles to a deed of a mefluage in Appleby, from Richard de 
Apelby to Robert de Veteripont fon of John.
In the 27 Ed. 1.
John de Berewife fon of John de Berewife granted lands in 
Afkeby to William fon of Simon de Brampton.
In the 30 Ed. 1.
William de Berewys reprefented the borough of Appleby

In the 7 Ed. 2.
Alexander de Berewife reprefented the faid borough.
In the 16 Ed. 3.
Thomas de Berewife, fon of Eujlace de Berewyfe, being then 
come of age, had livery of the manor of Berewyfe.
In the next year we find 
him ftyled Sir Thomas de Berewife.
In the 34 Ed. 3.
Thomas de Berewife reprefented the county of Weftmorland 
in parliament.
â€” And this is the lad of the name that hath occurred.
How the eflate came to the RofJ'e's, whether by marriage or otherwife, we 
have not found.
But in the 1 2 Hen, 7.
we find one Thomas Roos at Barwyfe-, who obtained 
a di ' psnfation to marry Elizabeth Blenkinfop of Hellebeck, his coufin in the

Afterwards it came into the hands of Sir John Sudivick: Who fold the fame

Lady Boyer fold the fame to Reginald Dob/on of Dufton ; who had a foil 
Reginald Dob/on, who had two daughters, Elizabeth married to Robert Bra-

Newcaftle upon Tyne merchant.
And Bar-wife was fold to John Stephenfon of 
Newcaftle aforefaid merchant; who fold the fame in 1748 to Thomas Carleton 
of Appleby efquire, who had only two daughters, the younger of whom was 
married to George Stephenfon of Warcop efquire, and died without iffue ; 
the elder daughter Elizabeth was married to John Metcalfe of Bellerby in the 
county of York efquire, and hath iffue now living, Elizabeth^ John, and 
Thomas.
HOFF AND DRYBECK.
From Barwife advancing towards the South-eafl, we arrive at Hoff and 
Drybeck-, which finifhes our perambulation of the parilh of St. Liurence.
Drybeck is a fmall village, confiding of about ten families, in the manor 
of Hoff: fo called from a fmall rivulet running by it, which in the fummer 
feafon is dry.
Hoffe (Offa) was a frequent name among the Saxons, and poflibly the 
village might receive its name from the owner, in like manner as the owner 
often received his name from the place he lived at.
There was one William de Offa witnefs to a deed of a mefiuage in Appleby, 
from Richard de Apelby to Robert fon of John de Vcteripont, in the reign 
of king Henry the third.
Neverthelefs, before this time, namely, in the reign of king Henry the 
fecond, Sir Hugh Morvil was in pofleffion thereof, from whom it defcended 
to his two daughters coheirs, Ada married to Thomas de Multon, and Joan 
married to Richard Gernon â€¢, which Joan had a daughter and heir Ada mar- 
ried to Richard Boyvil and afterwards to William de Furnival.
Thus by an 
inquifition in the 55 Hen. 3.
it is found, that Ada then widow of William 
de Furnival deceafed, held a moiety of a certain manor called Off, beyond 
Trent, in the county of Weftmorland â€¢, and that Helwife her daughter, wife 
of Euftachius de Balliol, was her next heir, aged 23 years.
But the whole 
afterwards, by failure of iflue of this younger branch, came to the Multons, 
defcendents of Sir Hugh Morvil's elder daughter Ada.
In the 20 Ed. 1, Sir Hugh de Multon or Hoffe was a juror at Appleby, in 
a caufe between the king and the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, 
concerning the advowioa of the two churches in Appleby.
Which Sir Hugh 
was not of the direct line, but probably a younger brother of the family.

By an inquifition in the 3 Ed. 2.
it was found, that the heir of Thomas de 
Mutton, then under age, held Hoff of Robert de Clifford lord of Weftmor- 
land.
And in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of the faid Robert, it was 'found, that 
the heir of Thomas de Multon of Gillefland held the manor of Hoff and Dry- 
beck â€¢, the wardfhlp whereof was worth 30/ a year, and the cornage 9; 2d.
This heir of Thomas de Multon was a daughter, viz.
Margaret de Multon of Gilfland ; who was married to Ranulph de Dacre, and 
brought with her the inheritance into the family of Dacre.
By an inquifition in the 18 Ed. 3.

In the 17 Hen. 6.
Thomis de Dacre, lord of GilQand, made a fettlement of 
his eftates, and amongft the reft, of the manor of Hoff, and all his lands and 
tenements in Drybeck and Appleby.
In the la ft year of king Hen. 6.
Ranulph de Dacre being (lain in the battle 
of Towton Field, his eftates were confiscated, but were reftored to his brother 
Humphrey by king Edward the fourth ; amongft the particulars whereof, is 
the manor of Hoff.
In the 1 Hen. 7.
after the death of the faid Humphrey, the inquifition 
finds, that Humphrey Dacre lord of Dacre and Gilfland held of Sir Thomas 
Thweng knight (who was probably a grantee of the crown, after the attainder 
of John lord Clifford) the manor of Hoff; and that Thomas Dacre was his 
fon and heir, of the age of 1 8 years on the feaft of St. Catherine then laft 
paft.
Which Thomas Dacre had a fon William, who had iffue Thomas, Leonard, 
Edward, and Francis.
Thomas had a fon George, who died in his infancy ; and 
three daughters, Anne, Mary, and Elizabeth ; of whom, Mary died unmar-.
ried, Anne was married to Philip earl of Arundel, and Elizabeth to the lord 
William Howard, both of them fons of Thomas duke of Norfolk.
The in- 
tailed eftates came to their uncles in tail male; all of whom were attainted of 
treafon and banifhed upon account of the affair of Mary queen of Scots.
Which intail continued till the tenth year of king Charles the firft, when Ra- 
nulph fon of Francis, the laft in the intail, died without iffue.
During the time of thefe eftates being in the crown, queen Elizabeth in the 
33d year of her reign demifed to Richard Southwaite gentleman the woods, 
underwoods, and trees growing in Hoff Lun wood, in the manor of Hoff 
and Drybeck, in four feveral copfes ; viz.

paid a fine of 6/ 8 s 4^, and a yearly rent of 3/ 6 s 8d.
And after the

Finally, William Williams^ who had been fteward at Grayftock caftle, pur- 
chafed this manor, and died leaving four daughters coheirs ; the eldeft was 
married to Sir Edward HafTel knight, the fecond to John Winder efquire 
counfellor at law, the third to Mr. kelph of Cockcrmouth, and the fourth to 
Dr. Gibbon dean of Carlifle.
The faid John Winder with the fecond daugh-

his kinfman Edward Milward efquire grandfon by his mother's fide to the faid 
Dr. Gibbon, and fonof the reverend Thomas Milward rector of Marton and

There was anciently a chapel at Hoff, wherein a chaplain was to officiate 
three days in every week â€¢, for which, as appears from bifhop Silvefter's en- 
dowment of the vicarage as aforefaid, 37 acres of land were afligned in the 
field of Hoff.
The fum of 18 j a year was payed out of Hoff to Shap abbey, for and in 
name of alms corn.
The hofpital of St. Leonard's York had two oxgangs of land in Drybeck.

At the fouth end of the old bridge at Hoff, is a place which in Mr. Ma-

At which time Appleby was burned.
Bones of dead men have been dug up near the old bridge ftead.

â€¢*â€¢ that of St. Michael, which now is fcarcely deemed part of Appleby, and 
goes commonly by the name of Bongate parifh.
Bongate, properly fo called, 
is the ftreet where the villani or bondmen inhabited, who were attendent upon 
the caftle to execute the fervile and laborious offices.
Thus by the inquifition aforefaid, on occafion of the difpute between the 
town and the owners of the caftle, it was found, that king John did not grant 
to Robert de Veteripont the town of Appleby then properly fo called, but Old 
Jppleby where the bondmen inhabit, 
This parifh is bounded on the eafl by the parifhes of Romaldkirk and War-

by the parifhes of Kirkby Thore, Marton, and Dufton â€¢, and contains in the 
whole about 145 families, all of the church of England.
It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at 20/ i$s.

Ranulph de Mefchines gave this church to the abbot and convent of St.
Mary's York : Which grant was confirmed by king Henry the fecond.
And 
the fame was confirmed and appropriated to the faid priory by Athelwald firft 
bifhop of Carlifle; whofe appropriation was confirmed by his fuccefibr Hu^h, 
under the following limitations â€¢, namely, that the cell of Wetheral poflefs the 
fame to their own ufe, faving to the faid abbey their ufual penfion ; and that 
they prefent a fit vicar to the fame, and allow him a ftipend of 5 marks, he 
difcharging all epifcopal and archidiaconal charges.
It feems, after this, that the bifhops of Carlifle claimed the patronage of the

the patronage to the priory of Wetheral *.
Neverthelefs, in the year 1248, the abbot and convent granted the patron- 
age of the laid vicarage to the then bifhop of Carlifle and his fucceflbrs -, favino- 
to the faid abbot and convent the penfion accuftomably paid to them out of 
the fame by the prior of Wederall.

In 1256, Waller Feadweil was vicar â€¢, as appears by an inftru nent in that 
year by Thomas Vipont bifhop of Carlifle executed at Bewley, on a reference 
to him by the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, ordaining, that the vicar 
and his fucceflbrs fhall have for their portion the tithes of laml> and wool, all

In the year 1291, there was a diipute between king Edward the firft and 
the abbot of St. Mary's York, conceining the advo r bn of the church of St.
Laurence in Appleby and the church of St. Michael in Appleby in Bonde- 
gate-, the king affirming that king Henry the fecond prefented to the fame 
Adam and John his clerks : But the jurors find, that the abbot had more 
right in the faid advowfons than the king.
The names of the jurors were, 
Thomas de Culwene, Hugh de Multon of Hoffe, William de Scirkeland, 
John de RofTegill, R.
le Englays, Richard de tVeftdri, knights ; Jo. M'auf- 
chael, William de Crakenthorp, Richard de Mufegrave, Jo. Fraunceis of

In 1302,.
one Richard de Bradewood was vicar-, who being accufed of non-

granted.
In 1339, on the death of Richard de Bradewood, Henry de Jppleby was col-

In 1362, Richard de Ajlackby was collated by bifliop Appleby.
In 1369, the fame bifliop collated John de Merlon-, who in the fame year

In fome of the Latin inftruments,

At the furtheft part thereof, on the weft fide, is an houfe which was built 
out of the ruins of an ancient friery, that ftood behind the oppofite row of

And it feems to

They were of an order of white friers - 3

In the 28th of the fame king, Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquire gave 
by his will 6s 8 d to the fryars of Appleby.
After the diifolution, in the 35 Hen. 8.
the king granted to Chriftopher 
Crakanthorpe of Newbiggin efquire, the houfe and fite of the late priory of 
Friers Carmelites, commonly named the white friers within the town of 
Appleby, With two gardens and one orchard by eftimation an acre and an 
half, and the toft late the cemitery of the faid late priory by eftimation one 
rood, and other lands in the parifh of Bongate belonging to the faid priory to 
the amount of 20 acres or thereabouts.
The purchafe money for this, and 
Hale Grange, and the manor of Hardendale and Wafdale, was 255/3 s.
Advancing further towards the north weft, in the way to Crackenthorp, 
we came to the ground called St. Nicholas ; which belonged of old to a little 
hofpital of that name : It ftood where the farm-houfe ftands now.
John de Veteripont gave this hofpital to the abbey of Shap.
Which do- 
nation was confirmed by Walter bifhop of Carlifle ; upon condition, that they 
fhould maintain there three lepers commonly called lazars for ever Â£,.
In the 5 Ric. 2.
Roger de Clifford gave licence to the monks of Hep, ta

J The hofpital alfo of St Leonard nigh Kendal was eftablifhed for the maintenance of lepers- - 
This difore'er feems to have prevailed in certain countries and at certain t'nv.s more than others.
Anciently irt this realm, there was a leoal provifion for removing of lepers apart from the reft of the-.- 
focie:y ; there being in the regiller of Writs the fim of a writ De kproj'o amt-veuc/o.
Perhaps the 
greater cleanlinefs of modern times may have contributed to abate the rigour of ibis dillemper; as 
alio the change of food, by the difufe in a great meafure of falted proviiions.
At the time of thefe 
charitable initiations, there were Itiv or no irxlcfuies in this realm, except only for deer ; and no Â» 
hay or other provender laid up for the fattening of cattle in v.it.ter : but they kilied and felted their, 
cattle and fl.eep at the beginning of winter, before tht:y became lean upon the common pattuie.
In., 
fome parts of the kingdom, and particularly in this county, there are yet fome remains of this 
practice in ialting up about Martinmafs- tide their beef for winter proviiion ; and perhaps this may be 
one reafon of the itch or fcurvy fometiroes prevailing amongft the poorer fort of people : as in an - 
higher degree, in long fea voyages, the necelfary ufe of failed provifiens occaiions diead/nl ravages,

After the diflblution, king Henry the eighth, in the 36th year of his reign, 
granted to Thomas lord Wharton, all that the hofpital of St. Nicholas nigh 
Appleby, with all the pofieffions and revenues thereto belonging.
In the 1 2th year of king James, Philip lord Wharton and Sir Thomas 
Wharton knight his fon and heir apparent, for the confederation of 7C0/, fold 
to Ifrael Fielding of Starforth in the county of York gentleman, all that the 
late clifiblved hofpital, farm, or grange, of St. Nicholas near Appleby, late 
belonging to the rnonailery of Shap, and all the mefiuages and lands thereto 
belonging, or enjoyed therewith for 40 years next before.
And in the year 1652, Anne countefs of Pembroke purchafed the faid farm 
of William Fielding efquire; and fettled the fame upon her hofpital at 
Appleby as aforefaid.
CRACKENTHORP.
Defcending further, on the north fide of the river Eden, we come to 
Ckackenthorp, which feems to have received its name from fome rookery 
there ; for crake to this day, amongft the country people, is ufed to fignify a 
rook or crow.
The Machels feem to have continued and refided at this place, longer than 
any one family of note at any other place in the county.
Above the degree 
of yeomen always ; and feldom or never afcending to the degree of knight.
Efquires or gentlemen conftantly, and peculiarly remarkable in all generations 
tor a brave and martial fpirit : To which, even their family name might fome 
little contribute.
The name was frequently written of ancient time Mau-chael y 
Malchael, and when latinized Malus Catulus.
And the reverend Thomas Ma- 
chel (whom we have often had occafion to mention with honour in thefe me- 
moirs, and who was a younger brother of this family) obferves, that before 
the holy war they fealed with a fingle Indian dog (as he calls it), ex graco et 
tigride nato ; in a rampant pofture, having a forked tail : and were called Mali 
Catuli, either becaufe the fir ft of that name had destroyed fome fuch noxious 
beaft, or (which indeed is more likely) was generally of a warlike difpofition.
The faid Thomas Machel goes farther, and fuppofes that they may be de- 
fcended from the Catuli amongft the ancient Romans.
But, without the help 
of conjecture, it is evident, that this was a name at the time of the conqueft.
In thoie parts of Weftmorland and the adjoining places which we have had 
occafion to take notice of, as mentioned in Domefday, we find, " In Lonefdale 
tt Cocreham baluerunt Ulf et Machel duas carucatas terra ad geldum." This the 
laid reverend gentleman would have been pleafed to have difcovered, in ho- 
nour of the antiquity of his name.
Whether Ulf and Machel had any cogna- 
tion, we cannot prefume to determine.
Ulf is no other than Wolf latinized, 
which is a name ftill in uie-, and the im predion of the feal at Crackenthorp 
which Mr. Machel dekribes, bears a ftrikins: refemblance of that animal.
Mr. Machel fuppofes that Whelp caftle at Kirkby Thore might receive its 
name from this family ; and that the family of Wbelpdale alio may poflibly 
have 
PARISH OF ST.
MICHAEL'S APPLEBY.
(Crackenthorp.) 34S 
have fome connexion therewith.
And there is indeed (befides the name) this 
refemblance, that the'three greyhounds (improperly, as it feemeth), which the 
Machels now bear inftead of the aforefaid fierce animal, are the arms alfo of 
the family de Whelp-dale.
There was one Liulf (UUlf) of Kirkby Thore, who gave lands there to 
the abbey of Holme Cultram in the reign of king Henry the fecond.
Alfo one "Waldeve fon of Gamel fon of Whelp gave lands there to the faid 
abbey.
And there is a confirmation by king Henry the fecond of a grant of lands 
at Crackenthorp to the priory of Carlifle, which had been given by Halth le 
Malchael and Eva his wife.
Which particle le feems to imply that Malchael 
(Malus Catulus) is a furname defcriptive of the perfon â€¢, as when we fay Ulf 
le Malchael (for inftance), it will fignify in plain Englilh Wolf that mif- 
chievous whelp.
There is no regular pedigree or fuccefllon of the Machel family.
They 
were very numerous, and difperfed into many branches : which diflipated partly 
the eftate, and renders it impoflible at this diftance of time to deduce the in- 
heritance in a dired lineal fucceflion.
What follows we have digefted in chro- 
nological order, chiefly from the copies or extracts of the family writings 
made by the faid Mr. Thomas Machel, which take up near half of his fifth 
volume.
i. The firft of the name that hath occurred at Crackenthorp is the faid 
Halth de Malchael, who (together with his wife as aforefaid) gave to the priory 
of Carlifle, probably at the foundation thereof, 15 acres of land by the bank 
of Truttebeck, and a meadow of the land of Crackenthorpe in Ellertker 
upon the banks of Hedene and of Truttebeck.
And there was a grant alfo 
to the fame priory, by Humphrey Malchael^ of one third part of the church 
of Lowthere.
2. About the 26 Hen. 2.
Willielwus Malus Catulus grants to Galfridus Malus 
Catulus certain lands at Crackenthorp, rendring to him yearly one pound of 
pepper or eight pence ; and doing for the fame toreign fervice to the king as 
much as appertained"!.
And if the faid Galfridus or his heirs fhall forfeit to 
any one in .word or deed that is not blodwite, they (hall pay 6d, and make 
fatisfaclion to the party injured: And if it be blodwite, they fhall pay 12 d, 
and alfo make like fatisfa&ion.
3. Towards the latter end of the fame king's reign, John Mauchael was 
witnefs to a grant of lands to the abbey of Holm Cultram, by Adam fon of 
Liulf of Kirkby Thore.
About the fame time Galfridus Malus Catulus granted lands at Crackenthorp 
to Alexander de Crackenthorp.
4. In the 7 Rio 1.
There was an exchange of lands at Croflebi and at Lou- 
dre, between Henry de Wichenton and Galfridus Malkael.
5. In the time of the faid Richard the firfb, Roger Machel (whom the Ma- 
chels -claim to be -of this family) was lord keeper of the great feal, and was 
drowned on the coaft of Cyprus, as he attended the king to the holy land.

It is faid, there is a place at Crackenthorp called from him Rogerheved, Ro- 
ger-head or hill.
6. John Mauchael was witnefs to the grant of the advowfon of the church 
of Kirk by Thore by Adam de Kirkby I hore to Robert de Veteripont, who 
lived in the reign of kiug John.
And the faid John Mauchael (as it feemeth) was witnefs to a grant of lands 
at Appleby by John de Veteripont fon of the faid Robert to Norman de 
Redman.
7. In the reign of Hen. 3.
William Mauchael granted to his brother Alex- 
ander Mauchael certain lands at Crackenthorp : And on the feal of this grant 
is the aforefaid rampant beaft (of whatever fpecies it might be).
8. In the reign of the faid king Henry the third, John Mauchel fon of 
Alexander made an agreement with William fon of William de Crackenthorp, con- 
cerning the moulcer of the corn-mill there.
9. In the reign of Ed. 1.
John Mauchel of Crackenthorp was witnefs to fe- 
veral deeds executed at the county court at Appleby.
And in the 20 Ed. 1.
he was a juror at Appleby between the king and the abbot and convent of 
St. Mary's York, concerning the advowfon of the two churches at Appleby.
10.
By an inquifition in the 3 Ed. 2.
and another in the 8 Ed. 2.
it appears, 
that Thomas Mauchell then held Crackenthorp under the Cliffords ; the ward- 
fhip whereof, when it fhould happen, was i^l 6 s 8d a year, and the cornage 
6s lod.
11.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
by inquifition, John Mauchell then held Cracken- 
thorp.
12.
In the 20 Ric. 2.
John Mauchell, granted lands at Crackenthorp to 
his fon William, on his marriage with Margaret daughter of William, de 
Thorneburgh.
13.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
By inquifition after the death of John lord Clifford, 
John Machell fon of William then held the manor of Crackenthorp; which 
John died in the 1 Ed. 4.
leaving a fon and heir John, being then above the 
age of 2 1 years.
14.
In the reign of king Henry the fixth, two of the Crackenthorps of 
Newbiggin were flain in the battle of Towton-field, amongft many of the 
northern nobility and gentlemen.
And it is probable the Machels of Crac- 
kenthorp then fuffered likewife ; for we find a pardon by king Ed. 4.
of this 
fame John Maychell.
15.
In the 1 Hen. 8.
there is a like pardon of Hugh Machell fon of John ; 
which although very full and comprehenfive, including treafons, murders, and 
other felonies, yet ieems to have been only upon a particular occafion, namely, 
on account of the efcape of one Henry Parker; for he is ftyled in the faid 
pardon Hugh Machell of Crackenthorp gentleman, otherwife called Hugh 
Machell one of the manucaptors of Henry Parker.
This Hugh had a brother Guy Machell, which Guy feems to have been the 
elder brother.
In the 5 Hen. 8.
there was an indenture made between the 
laid Guy and Hugh, that " if it fortune oder of theme to be fpendit in the

" and faderlefs ; in iymblable maner as their fader John Machell dyd unto his 
" childrin." 
In the fame year the faid Hugh had beaten the chantry prieft of Appleby; 
and there is an award thereupon, letting forth, that whereas Sir Henry Smyth 
the chauntry prieft of Appleby was beaten, hurt, and maimed by Hugh Ma- 
chell of Crakanthorp gentleman, and the faid parties had bound themfelves by 
their faith and troth to abide the award of Sir Stephen Ellis parfon of Skipton, 
Ambrofe Crackenthorp of Howgill efquire, Sir Alexander Hall vicar of Mor- 
land, and John Tillotfon bailiff of Carleton in Craven, the faid arbitrators do 
thereupon award, that the faid Hugh fhall pay to the chantry prieft 40 s a year 
[a large fum in thofe days] during his life, the payment to be made in the 
church of St. Laurence Appleby upon the altar of St. Nicholas the confefTor, 
or to the faid Henry in Appleby when the payment is ready: Provided, that 
if thej faid Hugh or any for him can provide a better thing for the faid Sir 
Henry, of which the faid Sir Henry fhall hold him contented, then the faid.
payment from thenceforth to ceafe.
In the 7 Hen. 8.
the aforefaid Guy farmed Colby Layths ; and he had a dis- 
pute with the vicar of Appleby concerning the tithes, which was compromifed 
by the mediation of Dr. Machel prebendary of York.
In the 10 Hen. 8.
the mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty of Appleby grant 
to Leonard Langhorne chaplain, in confideration of his teaching fchool there, 
two chantries in the church of St. Laurence and one in St. Michael's ; to which 
grant were witneffes (amongft others) Roland Machell, Hugh Mache.l, and Ed- 
mund Machell.
In the 1 1 Hen. 8.
there is an entry of feveral payments made by Sir Richard 
Garnet, vicar of St. Laurence Appleby, to Roland Machell, Edmund Machell, 
Nicolas Machell) Brian Machell, and Jacob Machell.
In the 13 Hen. 8.
there is a fubmifiion to an award, between Thomas Har- 
ryfon of Appleby yeoman, and Hugh Machell of Crakanthorp gentleman, upon 
all matters depending in traverfe between the faid parties, concerning the dif- 
tribution of the goods and chattels of the faid Sir Richard Garnet deceafed.
In the 21 Hen. 8.
Guy fuffered a recovery to cut off* the intail â€¢, and there 
was a fettlement to Guy for life, to Hugh his brother for life, then to TbÂ»mas 
fon of Guy and his heirs forever, of the eftates at Crakanthorp, Kefliff, Ar> 
pulby, and Brampton in Weftmorland, and atLafingby and Kirk Oufwald in 
Cumberland.
This fettlement was contefted by Richard fon of William Ma-

But it was decreed againft him.

In the 22 Hen. 8.
there was an award between the fa id Guy and Hugh, by 
Thomas Dudley and Richard Brifeow efquires, Robert â– Clibborne and AmTofe 
Machell gentlemen, with the umpirage of Thomas Blenkinibp and Gilbert 
"Wharton efquires ; concerning an ifland fuppofed to belong to and go in leafe 
always with the mill, and for the killing and hurting of divers fwine of the 
faid Guy by the children and fervants of the laid Hugh, for eating and deftroy- 
ing the corn and grafs of the faid Hugh: Which faid arbitrators, having firft 
determined concerning the ifland, proceed as to the fwine, and award, that the 
faid Hugh fhall for the faid trefpafs lay down before the arbitrators the fum of 
354^, for the ufe of the faid Guy ; and for the more amity to be had between 
the parties, they do award, after the receipt of the faid fum of $s /\.d, that 
the faid Guy fhall give back again the faid fum to the faid Hugh â€¢, and for 
all other trefpaffes in corn or grafs, or any unkindly or unlawful words fpoken 
by the faid Guy or Hugh, or by the wives of the faid Guy and Hugh, or any 
of their children, they do award the fame clearly to be laid afide, without any 
amends or report thereof to be made in reproach or hurt of any of them.
Two years after this, there was another arbitration between the faid parties 
about the mill, by the right reverend Richard Ewynwod abbot of Shape, Wil- 
liam Pykering efquire, Robert Clibburne and John Hoton gentlemen: Who 
by their award determine certain difputes about the mill at Crackenthorp, 
which Hugh had in leafe from Guy, and that both the faid parties releafe to 
each the fureties of the peace which they had each againft the other.
In the 28 Hen. 8.
the faid Guy made his will-, which, as it fbews perfectly

The marriage took effect, and they had 
fome lands feitled upon them at Crakanthorp and Layfenby.

In the 1 ,n 3 Ph. and Mary, there was a difpute between the faid 
Richard and Henry Machell his brother.
Richard t\\&ra\ned the goods of Henry 
and of divers others, for grcenhue, boon days, and other fervices.
This pro-

In the i6Eliz.
Barnaby Machell was appointed in the charter of foun-

The next of the family that hath occurred was Lancelot Machel efquire.
He had two fons, Hugh the elder; and Thomas above mentioned, who was 
fometime fellow of Queen's college in Oxford, fellow of the royal fociety, 
rerftor of Kirkby Thore, and chaplain in ordinary to king Charles the fecond.

Hugh Machel of Crackenthorp efquire, ion and heir of Lancelot.
His

Brough, when was he yet but young.
Upon Mr. T 's offering to fend 
a challenge by him unto his father, Hugh took him in hand himfelf, and 
beat him fo as to end the controverfy without further trouble.
The other in- 
ftance was near Ma r ton church, in the year j 688 ; where being challenged by 
his coufin W.
S. he broke his adverfary's fword in the combat, and thereupon 
threw away his own, ran in upon his adverfary, flruck up his heels, and gave 
him that life which he would not afk.

Lancelot Machel efquire, fon of Hugh.
He was humane, gallant, ho- 
nourable, and univerfally refpected ; and died at Crackenthorp in the year 
1767, in the 8hth year of his age; having been many years fberiff of the 
county under the right honourable the earl of Thanet.
He was fucceeded by his fon and heir, 
23.
Richard Machel, M.
A. the worthy rector of Afby and of Brougham, 
now living {viz.
in 1775J ; who has a ion and heir apparent Lancelot, and 
other children.
The arms which they now bear (wherein they have deviated from the ori- 
ginal, as having little connexion with the Malus Catulus of old) are; Sable, 
three greyhounds courant Argent, collared Or.
The manor houfe is an handfome building, beautifully fituate, with fair fields 
behind it down to the river Eden.
At a place called Chapel-hill, there are the ruins of an ancient chapel dedi- 
cated to Sc, Giles.
And there is (till a place called Chapel garth, and a well 
adjoining called Chapel well.
This chapel muft have been very convenient to 
the neighbourhood, by reafon of their diftance from the mother church.
Pro- 
bably it might b^ fupported from part of the tithes, whilft the monafteries 
fub filled.
The oblations at the faid chapel in the 26 Hen. 8.
were valued at 
15 j a year.
Nigh the way-fide, between Crackenthorp and Kirk by Thore, on the fouth 
of the ancient Roman way, is a large Roman camp, 300 yards in length, and 
150 yards in breadth ; having three entrances on each fide and at each end, 
with bulwarks before them.
And at about a bow-fliot diftance, further by 
the way-fide, is a fmall/<5r/, called Maiden-hold; which feems to have been as 
a guard houfe or watch tower belonging to the camp ; and by its name may 
pofiibly have fome relation to the Maiden-way at Kirkby Thore, and Maiden-- 
cajile upon Stanemore *.
At a place called Machel's bank, about ten yards from the Roman way, .
were difcovertd by fome workmen cafting a ditch, three urns-, with burnt 
bones and aihes therein; contiguous to each other, in a triangular form, in 
the middle of a round pit of clay made for the purpofe, about a yard deep, 
with the fides perpendicular.
And herein they were compaffed and covered 
* Macjiel.
with 
352 PARISH OF ST.

(Crackenthor*.) 
with burnt bones and black allies, to within a foot of the furface of the ground, 
the remainder being clofed up with earth.
The urns were of a blackilh fort 
of clay, but fofter than earthen pots are wont to be, for the fherds would not 
ring.
In the two largeft were allies and bones ; but in the lealt, allies only.
And about 40 or 50 yards diftant from the former, by the way-fide alfo, was 
found a pit of like form, full of alhes and bones without any urns â€¢, which 
gave occafion to the faid Mr. Thomas Machel to conjecture, that urns were a 
mark of diftin&ion, for perfons of fuperior quality.
HELTON BACON.
Towards the north-eaft from Crackentborp, we came to Helton, by way of 
diftinction called Helton Bacon (there being another Helton in the Parilh of 
Afkham).
We cannot derive the name of this village from any bill, for of 
ancient time (fo far as our materials extend) it is invariably written Helton.
Helle fignifies to pour out ; as Hellebeck probably had its name from the torrent 
of water rulhing down there.
Which alfo may have been the cafe here at 
this place.
But the prefent artificial torrent at Helton Bacon, by hufhing (as 
it is called) for getting lead ore, is not of any antiquity (fo far as we can find), 
and feemeth not to have been praftifed in Weftmorland till of late year?.
How far a right of hufhing can be now eftablifhed, independent of ufage and 
prefcription, it is not our province to inquire.
But certain it is, that the thick 
mud, running down into the pure limpid ftream of Eden, pollutes the water 
for many miles in its defcent, and renders it lefs wholefome to the cattle and 
alfo to the king's fubjects, and banilhes the fine trout for which Eden has been 
famous for ages.
â€” But it is poffible the word Helton here may have been only a 
contraction of Heller t on ; for one of the firft families of note which we find 
here did bear that name.
In the partition of the inheritance between the two daughters and coheirs of 
the lalt Robert de Veteripont in the 14 Ed. 1.
were affigned to Idonea the 
younger daughter, the homage and fervices of Thomas de Hellerton, Robert 
de Bacon, and others, for the manor of Helton.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Robert Bacon and the heirs of Andrew de Hellerton then held Helton j the 
wardlhip whereof, when it mould happen, was worth 13/ a year, and the 
cornage 13 s 8d.
This Andrew de Hellerton bad the fame by grant from his 
coufin Thomas de Hellerton.
Robert Bacon, the owner of the other moiety, 
fhews clearly how this Helton came by the name of Helton Bacon.
The faid heirs of Andrew de Hellerton were probably daughters.
For in the 
â€¢ 43 Ed. 3.
William VEngleys and John de Appleby held the Hellerton moiety, and 
Adam Bacon the other moiety.
In the 4 Hen. 4.
William Whapelote and Ellen his wife in the right of the 
faid Ellen, and Adam Bacon, held the manor of Helton Bacon.
â€” And from 
henceforth we hear no more of Bacon.
But after this we find the manor in 
the hands of the Heltons-, who came hither from Burton in the parilh of War- 
cop, 
PARISH OF ST.

cop, but probably (fo far as one may judge from the name) had originally 
fprung from this place.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John lord Clifford, Richard Rijlwald 
and John Helton held the manor of Helton Bacon.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
Richard Rijlwald and Thomas Helton held the fame.
And 
two years after, we find Thomas Helton of Helton (by way of diftinction, as 
it may fcem, from Helton of Burton) was one of the coroners for the county 
of Weftmorland.
In the 16 Hen. 7.
Richard Reflwolde (by way of fettlement) conveyed to 
John Withers^ Chrifiopher Bainbridge, Nicholas Mayowe, and Richard Newport, 
clerks, a moiety of the manor of Hilton Bacon.
And in the 16 Hen. 8.
the furvivor John Withers conveyed the lame to Ed- 
ward Hilton of Bleachyndon in the county of Oxford clerk ; who in the fame 
year granted the fame in truft to John Pantrie and Ambrofe Hilton of Oxford 
clerks, John Whelpdaile of Penrith and Richard Rigg of Little Strickland 
gentlemen.
In the 19 Hen. 8.
the faid Edward Hilton granted the fame to Robert Hilton 
of Burton, and the faid truftees releafed their intereft therein to the faid Robert 
Hilton accordingly.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, Thomas Helton held the manor of Helton 
â– Bacon.
Next, we come to the pedigree certified at Sir William Dugdale's vifitation 
in 1664*, which proceeds as follows : 
1. Robert Hilton of Hilton Bacon, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, mar- 
ried a daughter of Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquirej and by her had 
iffue, (1) Thomas.
(2) Anthony, who died unmarried.
(3) John Hilton of 
Gainsford in the county of Durham.
[N.
B. Here ought to come in another Thomas (according to a pedigree by 
Sir Daniel Fleming, which feems more authentic) who married the widow of 
Brackenberg, whole maicten name was Bainbridge.] 
2. Thomas Hilton of Hilton Bacon married Jane daughter and coheir of 
Reginald Hartley of Appleby; and died about the year 1632.
They had 
iffue, (i) George, who died unmarried.
(2) Tiibmas.
(3) Katherine, mar- 
ried to Brian Garnet of Kendal.
3. Thomas Hilton of Hilton Bacon married Elizabeth daughter of Thomas 
Sandfordof Afkhamefquire-, and died in 1645.
They had iffue, (1) Robert.
(2) Thomas.
(3) George Hilton of Bongate.
(4) Martha, married to Ro- 
bert Collingwood of the county of Durham.
4. Robert Hilton of Hilton Bacon efquire, aged 45 at the aforefaid vifitation.
He married Mary daughter of John Hilton of Hilton-caftle in the county of 
Durham, commonly called baron Hilton.
They had iffue, John, Thomas, 
Robert, Elizabeth, Alice, and Mary.

Robert Hilton of 
Durham efquire and Mary his wife and 'Thomas Hilton of Murton gentleman, 
fon.and heir apparent of the faid Robert, infranchifed divers cuftomary tene-' 
ments in Brackinber, Hilton Bacon, Ellerholme, and Bongace.
Others of the 
tenements were infranchifed by the Hiltonsat different times.
And finally, the 
manor itfelf and demefne were fold in the year 1696, to Sir John Lowther of 
Lowther: Except fome lands which came by mortgage to lawyer Fletcher; 
and except a long leafe of the royalties which had been granted to the duke 
of Bridge water.
The arms of Hilton are-, Sable, 2 fakiers in chief, and 3 annulets, 2 and i> 
Argent.
'I he cred : On a wreath, a demigriffin.
The ancient manor houfe is now much in ruins.
Anciently, here was a chapel, about a quarter of a mile from the village; 
which is now intirely demolifhed.
MURTON.
Next unto Helton, further towards the eaft, is Murton, that is, the 
Moor-town.
There are many places of this name in the kingdom.
Morvil is 
the fame latinized.
By the inquifition poft mortem of the firft Roger de Clifford, in the 11 Ed. 1.
it is found, that he held in the right of his wife Ifabella, in the vill of Mor- 
ton, one capital meffuage of the value of is yearly, and one carucate of land 
in demefne, which contains in it 120 acres of arable land, of which every acre 
was worth 8 d yearly (faving the fervice of the lords of the fee); 16 acres of 
meadow, worth 12*/ an acre yearly; 5 acres of wood, worth 6 dan acre, with- 
out wade: That there were fix free tenants who paid gs 4^ yearly, and did 
fuit at the court there from three weeks to three weeks : That he had there ten 
bondmen, each of whom held one oxgang of land, for which he paid $s nd 
yearly for all fervices and burdens ; except the aid at the fead of St. Michael, 
which was 26s Sd. And that the perquifites of his free court in the faid vill 
were worth yearly is.
And he held all the premiffes of Baldwin Wak, by 
homage and foreign fervice.
But in the next king's reign, we find the manor of Morton in the hands of 
the Mifgraves of Mufgrave, in which it continued for many generations.
In 
the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert lord Clifford, it appears, that Thomas 
Mufgrave, then under age and in warddup, held of the faid Robert, Great 
Mufgrave and Morton ; the wardfhip whereof was worth 42 / a year, and the 
cornage for both il 11s \d.
â–  
And fo it continued in the Mufgraves all along, till the nth year of king 
James, when Sir Richard Mufgrave of Hartley-cadle knight fold the fame to

Thomas Hilton of Hilton; who removed from Hilton to the manor houfe 
there.
Hie faid houfe, called Murton-hall, is fituate under a high mount called 
Mellfell ; and near to the remarkable hill, like a pyramid, called Murton 
Pike.
It was a good old houfe and convenient ; a fpring of water running 
through it.
There was a chapel here formerly ; the place being diftant about three miles 
from the parifh church.
Part of the demefne lands were fold by the Hiltons to lawyer Fletcher of 
Strickland : The reft of the demefne and manor were fold to Sir John Low- 
ther the purchafer of many eftates and manors in this county : in whofe pof- 
terity the fame (till continue.
L A N G T O N.
Southwards again from Murton, and north-eaft from Bongate, is Langton, 
which now lies chiefly in demefne.
It was purchafed by Robert de Vete- 
ripont of Ada daughter of John Tallebois and widow of Robert de Clive- 
land, unto whom it had defcended from her mother.
It feems to have been anciently well inhabited ; and the name itfelf implies 
it, Lotig-tozvn.
And there feems to have been a church or chapel here, fo far 
as we may judge from names ; for there is a place called Kirkbergh, which is, 
and from ancient time hath been, held free and independent of the manor, ex- 
cept only the payment of is cornage.
By an inquifition after the death of Roger lord Clifford in the i Ed. 3.
it 
was found as follows : â€” At Langeton, the fite of a certain manor burned by 
the Scots, worth nothing yearly for want of tenants, and by reafon of the de- 
ftruclion made by the Scots.
And there are 30 acres of demefne land, which* 
lie unfilled for the reafon aforefaid, the herbage whereof is worth yearly 18 d.
Thirty oxgangs of land, which lie unfilled for the caufe aforefaid, the herb- 
age whereof is worth i$s 6d a year.
Sixteen acres of demefne meadow, worth 
yearly 35 and no more, for the too great abundance of meadow and piilure in 
thofe parts.
Four cottages, which yield yearly is.
One water mill, worth 
yearly 133 \d.
Pleas and perquifites of the court of Appleby and Langton, 
worth yearly \s.
And after the death of John lord Clifford, in the 10 Hen. 5.
the inquifition 
finds, that at Langton there are 10 meffuages, worth nothing in iffiies above 
reprifes; 40 oxgangs of land, at 3^4^ each; fourfcore acres of meadow, at 
6d each; water mill, 13s $d; one fulling mill, 6s Sd; one hundred and 
fourfcore acres of pafture at one penny each.

PARISH OF DUFTON.
DUFF was anciently a name in Scotland, and perhaps alfo in England.
Macduff is a name well known ; which means the fon of Duff.
And it is 
not improbable that Duften (Buff's town) might be fo called from fome perfon 
of that name.
The parifh of Dufton is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Middleton 
in the county of Durham, Romaldkirk in the county of York, and Brough in 
the county of Weftmorland ; on the South, by the parifli of St. Michael's 
Appleby, on the Weft, by the parifh of Marton-, and on the North, by the 
parifh of Alfton in the county of Cumberland, and the laid pariih of Middle- 
ton.
It contains in the whole about 6$ families.
It is a rectory ; valued at 19/ 2 s 6d in the king's books.
The church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert.
The patronage of this rectory was of ancient time in the barons of Gray- 
flock, and from them by marriage came into the family of Dacre, being alfo 
at the fame time lords of the manor of Dufton ; and the advowfon ftill con- 
tinues appendant to the faid manor.
The firft: of the Grayftocks that we have met with, who had any connection 
with Weftmorland, was Thomas baron of Grayftock, who married Chriftian 
daughter of the firft Robert de Veteripont.
And it is not improbable, that 
this might introduce Jiim to Dufton and other places in Weftmorland.
For 
in the next generation but one, we find Dufton clearly in the hands of the 
Grayftocks, and attended with circumftances which imply that it had been in 
the family for fome time before.
By the inquifition poft mortem of Robert de Clifford in the 9 Ed. 2-.
it ap- 
pears, that Ralph fon of William de Grayftock held of the faid Robert the vil- 
lages of Dufton, Brampton, Bolton, and Yanewich â€¢, the wardfhip whereof 
(when it mould happen) was worth 100 marks per annum, and the cornage 
25 s 6d.
By the inquifition after the death of John lord Clifford in the 10 Hen. 5.
it 
is found that John de Grayftock fon of Ralph held the manors of Dufton, Bramp- 
ton, Bolton, and Yevenwith of the fame John lord Clifford, with the fame 
cornage as before.
Again, in the 31 Hen. 6.
it is found by inqutft that Ralph baron of Gray- 
ftock held of the lord Thomas de Clifford, Yanwith, Bolton, Brampton, and 
Dufton â€¢, and that Lancelot Threlkeld held Yanwith of the faid Ralph, Ni- 
colas Radcliff held Bolton, and Thomas Lancaftre held Brampton, and that 
Dufton was in the hands of the faid baron himfelf.
In the 4 Ed. 4.
after the death of the fecond John de Clifford, this Ralph 
baron of Grayftock held the fame.
In the 2 Hen. 7.
after the death of Ralph baron of Grayftock, the inqui-

That on the day on which he died, he was feiled of

Weftmorland in the 18 Hen. 8.
it appears, that William Dacre knight, lord 
of Dacre, held then the manor of Dufton.
And by a like inquifition in the 
1 & 2 Ph.
& Mary, he appears then alfo to have held the fame.
This family of Dacre ended in daughters coheirs.
For George lord Dacre 
dying unmarried, the inheritance came to his three fillers.
Of whom, 
Anne the eldeft was married to Philip Howard earl of Arundel, eldeft fon of 
Thomas duke of Norfolk.
And in the partition of the eftate, Dufton fell to 
her purparty.
She had a fon and heir Thomas earl of Arundel; who had a fon 
and heir Henry earl of Arundel, in whofe time a leafe of the lordfhip of Dufton 
for 99 years was granted to Sir Chrijlopher Clapham knight, in which leafe the 
claule prohibiting walte having been omitted, he cut down all the wood called 
Dufton wood, and fold it for more than the whole purchafe coft him.
The 
remainder of the term, and afterwards the perpetuity of the eftate, was pur- 
chafed by John Winder of Lorton in Cumberland, counfellor at law ; who was 
fucceeded by his fon and heir Williams Winder efquire; who, dying without 
ifibe, devifed the fame to the prefent owner Edward Mil-ward efquire, fon of 
the reverend Thoma*.
Milward, M.
A. reel or of Marton and of Kirkby 
Thore.
The fuccefuon of incumbents hath been as followeth : 
In 1293, Sir John de Grayftock knight p relents one Henry de Waleys to the 
rectory of Dufton on the 30th of January, upon a vacancy by the death of Sir 
Robert the laft redtor there, who died on the Monday before St. Paul's day 
in the year aforegoing: Whereupon a jus patronatus was ordered, and (in the 
mean time) the cure committed to William Boukes.
The conteft feems to have 
been long, for the faid Henry had not inftitution given before the firft of July 
in 1298.
And the iffue of the caule appears in an entry of fines levied in the 
27 Ed. 1.' Between Ralph fon of William de Grayftock complainant, and John 
fon of William deforciant, concerning the manor and barony of Grayftoke ia 
the county of Cumberland and the advowfon of the church there, and the 
manor of Dufton with the appurtenances and the advowfon of the church of 
the fame manor in the county of Weftmorland : The faid John acknowledged 
the right to be in the faid Ralph after the deceafe of him the faid John*, and 
he fubmitted to hold of the faid Ralph during the life of him the faid John, and 
alter his death the premises to remain to the faid Ralph and his heirs.
In : 3 15, Matthew de Redman rector of Dufton had a difpenfation of abfence, 
for the better following his ftudies, for three years.

Dufton.
In 141 2, Robert Cclda 11 was rector of Dufton; who in that year furrendred 
certain lands to Ralph baron of Grayftock.
In 5449, a writ of poffeffion of the manor of Dufton and advowfon of the

I. PARISH OF MARTON.
"JT\Escending from Dufton towards the weft, we come to the parifh of Mar- 
-"^ ton, which was anciently written Merton\ and Mr. Machel fuppofes the 
fame to be fo called from a mere or lake at the north end of the town.
It is 
commonly called hong Marton, not from its extraordinary length, as it fhould 
feem, (for many other villages in the bottom of Weftmorland are longer ;) 
but more likely by way of diftinction from fome other place of the fame name.
But of fuch other there is at prefent no appearance, unle.fs we fuppofe Murton 
and Marton to have had originally the fame appellation.
It is once, in the 
bilhop's regifter, called Merton Parva.
But there is no judging what thefe 
places were formerly, by what they are now â€¢, nor yet what they were formerly 
?.t different periods.
For the Scots made ftrange alterations often in a very 
fhort time.
Even Langton (we have feen), which feems to have been called 
the Long town by way of eminence, is now no town at all: and we have fhewed 
the realbn of it.
The parifh of Marton is bounded on the eafi: by the parifh of Dufton, on 
the fouth by the parifh of St. Michael's Appleby, on the well by the parifh 
of Kirk by Thore, and on the north by the parifh of Alfton in the county of 
Cumberland : and contains in it three manors or lordfhips, viz.
Marten, 
Bramptcn, and Knock ; and in the whole about 173 families.
The church, according to Dr. Todd, is dedicated to St. Margaret and St.
James.
â€” Perhaps St. James may be the tutelar faint of the church.
St. Mar* 
garet had a quire there dedicated to her, as appears by the laft will and tefta- 
ment of Sir John de Morelaunde hereafter mentioned.
It is a rectory, valued at 21/ i/jj y^d in the king's books ; in the patronf 
age of the right honourable the earl of Thanet, by hereditary defcent from the 
Veteriponts and Cliffords.

II.
MANOR OF MARTON.
The manor of Marton appears to have belonged to the Veteriponts.
And 
by an inquifition of wade fuffered by the prior of Carlifle, whilft he was guar- 
dian of the lad Robert de Veteripont, in the reign of king Henry the third, 
it was found, that at Merton certain fheepfolds (bercaria) of fourfcore feet in 
dimenfion were alienated by the prior, and the park deftroyed by dogs and 
nets, and want of inclofure; that the little vivary was deftroyed, fo that there 
was taken from thence as much as could be taken by nets; and the great vi- 
vary much impoverifhed of great fifh.
In the partition of Marton between the two daughters of the faid Robert, 
each of their fhares was eftimated at 13/ 3 J 5^d: Befides the advowfon of the 
church, which was eftimated at 40 marks, when it fhould be vacant.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
the heirs of Thomas de Wake held the manor of Merton of 
Roger de Clifford, by homage and fealty, and 8 s 6d cornage.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of the faid Roger de Clifford, John de Hol- 
land knight held the fame.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
John de Gray knight and Margaret his wife, as of the right 
of the faid Margaret^ held the fame in like manner.
I n the 3 1 Hen. 6.
Thomas Gray knight, and afterwards in the fame year 
Thomas Salinger knight held the fame.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
it was in the hands of the king: By what title we have 
not found.
Finally, this manor, like many of the reft, came into the hands of the 
Lowthers., in which family it ftill continues.
III.
MANOR OF BRAMPTON.
Brampton is a long ftraggling village, about a mile eaftward from 
Marton.
There were feveral of the name de Brampton of ancient time ; but none, fo 
far as we have found, that was lord of the manor.
In the 3d, and again in the 8 Ed. 2.
we find Ralph fon of William deGray* 
Jiock held of the Cliffords, Brampton, Dufton, Bolton, and Yanwich ; the 
wardfhip whereof, when it fhould happen, was worth yearly 100 marks, and 
the cornage \l 5s 6d.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
Sir John de Gray/lock knight held the fame as above.
After this, we find Brampton in the name and family of Lancajler, who 
are faid to have been a younger branch of the Lancafters of Sockbridge.
We find one Johnde Lancajler, who held Brampton in the reign of Edward the 
fourth ; his fon John held the fame in the reign of Henry the feventh ; and Ed- 
ward Lancajler in the reign of Henry the eighth.
The 
PARISH OF MARTON.
363 
The Lancaflers held the fame immediately of the Grayftockf, and the Gray- 
flocks held over of the Cliffords.
Thus, on a Quo Warranto brought againft 
Henry lord Clifford in the 19 Hen. 7.
the faid lord Clifford fet forth, that 
John Lancafter died feifed of the manor of Brampton in the 10 Ed. 4.
his fon 
and heir John being then 30 years of age : That John Lancafter the elder held 
the fame of John late baron of Grayftoke, by knights fervice, to wit, ho- 
mage, fealty, and fcutage, namely, twenty millings when fcutage runs at 
forty (hillings : That the faid baron of Grayftoke held the fame ultra of Henry 
lord Clifford by the like fervices : That the faid John Lancafter the elder died 
in the homage of the baron, and the baron died in the homage of the faid lord 
Clifford, the fon and heir of the faid baron being then 22 years of age, who 
paid to the faid lord rent, homage, fealty, relief, and all other fervices.
This family of Lancafter ended in three daughters, in the reign of queen 
Elizabeth-, the eldeft of whom was married to Birkbeck of Hornby; the fe- 
cond to Backhoufe of Morland ; and the third to Wharton of Kirkby Thore.
And thereupon the manor became parted into three portions.
Mr. Birkbeck 
exchanged his fhare with Henry earl of Cumberland for lands at Hornby ; 
which part ftill continues in his defcendent the prefent earl of Thanet.
1 he 
defcendents of Mr. Backhoufe enjoy the fecond part.
And the third part, 
which belonged to the Whartons, hath been fold to the tenants.
The ancient manor houfe, called Brampton-hall, was built anew by 'Thomas 
Burton efquire, grandfon of Richard Burton aforefaid, rector of this parifh ; 
which Thomas Burton was a juflice of the peace for this county in the time 
of Oliver Cromwell, and was afterwards knighted by king Charles the fecond 
for divers fervices he had performed (though anOliverian) to the royal party.
The faid Sir Thomas Burton fold the fame to the anceftor of the prefent George 
Baker of E.llemore-hall efquire, who fold the fame to divers of the inhabitants, 
whodemolifhed the hall, leaving only fo much remaining as was fufficient for 
fitting up a farm houfe.
IV.
MANOR OF KNOCK.
Knock, anciently called Knock Shalcock, is a little village about a mile north 
from Marton.
It belonged, amongft the reft, to the Veteriponts and Clif- 
fords; and the firft family that appears to have held the fame under the Cliffords 
were the Boyvils.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
John de Boyvile held Knock Shalcock ; the wardfhip where- 
of was worth 13/ bs X d, and the cornage 3^4^.
In the 2 Ed. 3.
John de Boyvile de Knoke held two parts of the manor afore- 
faid of Roger de Clifford ; Robert his fon and heir being then 16 years of 
a g e - 
In the 43 Ed. 3.
John de Rookeby held the manor of Knock Salcock.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
William de Soulby held the fame.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
Thomas de Rookby : And after him, John Rookby held the 
fame ; who had a daughter and heir Joan married to John Lancafter of How- 
3 A 2 gill 
364 PARISH OF MARTON, 
gill knight, who in the 31 Hen. 6.
held the manor of Knock in right of his 
laid wife.
The faid John Lancafter of Howgill died without ifiue male, leaving four 
daughters coheirs.
And in the partition of the eflate, Knock was in the fhare 
appointed for Cbrijlian and Elizabeth â€¢, the former of whom was married to Sir 
Robert de Harrington, and the latter to Robert Crackenthorp efquire.
After this, we find the manor of Knock in the Clifford family, perhaps by 
purchafe from the faid coheirs ; in which family it ftill continues in the perfon 
of the prefent earl of Thanet.
The abbey of Shap had fome lands here, given by John de Veteripont ; 
which were parcel of the demefne.
PARISH OF NEWBIGGIN.
fir H E parifh of Newbiggin (New-building; big being a word not yet quite 
â– *â–  out of ufe, fignifying to build) is a fmall parifh about three miles in 
compafs, furrounded by the parifh of Kirkby Thore, except only on the 
north where it joins to the parifh of Kirkland in Cumberland, being feparated 
therefrom by a fmall rivulet, which defcends from the mountain Crofsfell (one 
of the higheft mountains in the north, fo called probably from a crofs creeled 
thereupon by way of boundary between two parifhes or lordfhips) which ri- 
vulet from its firft rifing, until it fall into the river Eden, divides the two 
counties of Weflmorland and Cumberland.
This parifh contains only the townfhip of Newbiggin, and part of the ham- 
let of Hale, the grange whereof belonged heretofore to the abbey of Holm 
Cuhram.
Thus in the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John lord Clifford, the 
inquifition finds, that the abbot of Holme then held the grange of Hale, pay- 
ing for the fame yearly 13 s \d.
The church is dedicated to St. Edmund; and is a rectory, valued at 4/ 14^ 
1 d in the king's books, in the patronage of the lord of the manor.
It has 
only about 1 1 acres of glebe land â€¢, and the tithe corn, it is faid, of the whole 
parifh belongs to the lord of the manor by prefcription, under the yearly rent 
of 9/ 6s 2d, and an horfe grafs to the rector: By what right, we prefume not 
to determine.
From the fmallnefs of the parifh, and the comparative large- 
r.efs of the prefcriptive rent, there is no room to fuppofe this to be a very 
ancient compofition.
And it hath no benign afpe<5t towards the patron, in 
prefcribing terms to his prefentee.
Which yet is a cafe that frequently hap- 
pens, where the lord of the manor is patron of the advowfon.
In 1759, Mrs. Deborah Crackenthorp gave 200/, whereby to procure an 
augmentation by the governors of queen Anne's bounty â€¢, wherewith an 
erlate was purchafed at Kirkofwald, now of the yearly value of 20/.
c The 
PARISH OF NEWBIGGIN.
The parfonage houfe is but an indifferent building; which ftands at the north- 
weft end of the village near the church.
The firft: grant that we meet with of the manor of Newbiggin (with the 
advowfon appendant) was from Camel Ton of Whelp, to 
i. Robert, dapifer de Appleby â€¢, who thereupon afllimed the name of Robert 
de Newbiggin.
Which grant Waldeve fon of Gamel confirmed by deed to 
Laurence fon of the faid Robert.
2. This Laurence, who lived in the reign of king Hen. 2.
married a Whar- 
ton i which is ancienter than any account that we have met with of the 
Whartons of Wharton (much more, of the Whartons of Kirkby Thore).
But 
at our firft account of the Whartons of Wharton, in the reign of Edward the 
firft, they were then a confiderable family.
So that this account (which in 
the prefent pedigree is chiefly taken from a manufcript of Sir Daniel Fleming) 
may likely enough be right.
This Laurence fon of Robert de Newbiggin gave lands at Newbiggin to the 
abbey of Holm Cultram, by the metes and bounds in the grant fpecified*.
He had iffue, 
3. John de Newbiggin, who married a BlennerhafTet. Who had iffue, 
4. John, who married a Barton.
One of the witneffes to the grant of the 
advowfon of the church of Kirkby Thore by Adam de Kirkby Thore to Robert 
de Veteripont, in the time of king John or Henry the third, is John de Neiv- 
biggin (probably this fame John).
Who had iffue, 
5. "Thomas, who married a Vaux.
And had a fon, 
6. Robert, in the reign of Ed. 1.
who married Agnes a daughter of Wac- 
kerfield.
By an inquifition after the death of Robert de Clifford, who died in the 
7 Ed. 2.
the jurors find, that Robert de Newbigging then held the manor of 
Newbigging; the wardfhip whereof was worth 10/, and the cornage iod.

bigging to the rectory there, who was inftituted thereupon ; faving to the 
church of Kirkby Thore the yearly penfion of 3 5 of old time due and ac- 
cuflomed.
â€” Accordingly in an account of the profits of the rectory of Kirkby 
Thoie in the year 1575, we find amongft the receipts 35 paid to the rector 
of Kirkby Thore out of the rectory of Newbiggin.
By which it feemeth, 
that Newbiggin is a parifh carved out of the parilh of Kirkby Thore-, or, 
to Ipeak more properly, that this was originally no more than a chapel of 
eafe, and that this payment (as was common in fuch cafes) was referved as 
an acknowledgment of the fuperiority of the mother church.
And befides the aforefaid penfion, the rector of Newbiggin was bound to 
perform altar fervice at the church of Kirkby Thore two days in the year, on 
which days, the rector of Kirkby Thore was to find a dinner for the faid rector 
of Newbiggin and his dog.
The faid Robert de Newbiggin had a fon and heir, 
7. Robert de Newbiggin, who married Emma a daughter of Threlkeld; and 
in the 10 Ed. 2.
made a fettlement of his eftate, to him and his wife Emma 
during their lives and to the heirs of their bodies, remainder to his own right 
heirs.
This Robert was the laft of the male line of the name de Newbiggin, 
having only a daughter, 
X. Emma de Newbiggin, who about the 5 Ed. 3.
was married to Robert de 
Crackenthorp, fuppofed by the reverend Thomas Machel to have been a younger 
brother of the Machels of Crackenthorp, who thereupon took the arms of 
Newbiggin, as was ufual on the marriage of heireffes.
And the family pe- 
digree Items to confirm this account, by attributing the fame arms both to 
Newbiggin and Crackenthorp.
Neverthelefs, there feems to be fome caufe of 
doubt in this matter.
For although it might be not improbable that one of 
the family of Machel mould take the name de Crackenthorp (for there are 
many inftances of local names thus afiumed), yet it is not likely that Robert 
would altogether relinquifh his own family arms, nor was it ufual in like cafes; 
but rather he would quarter the arms of Newbiggin with his own paternal 
arms of Machel.
And in fact, the Crackenthorps bore the fame arms before 
this match with Newbiggin (for this Robert was not the firft of the name) 
which they bore afterwards.
In an ancient roll of arms in the heralds office 
of the knights that attended king Edward the firft in his expedition into Scot- 
land, are the arms of Crackenthorp, the fame as they are now, viz.
Or, a 
cheveron between three mullets pierced Azure.
In the reign of king Hen. 3.
we find at Crackenthorp one William de Cracken- 
thorp fon of William, who made an agreement with John Mauchel about the 
mili there.
In the 18 Ed. 1.
the faid John Mauchael and William de Crackenthorp were 
witneffes to a grant of lands at Sandford, by John de Sandford to John de 
Helton.
At the fame time, William de Crackenthorp (as appears upon the di- 
vifion of the barony of Weftmorland between the two daughters of Robert 
de Veteripont) held a third part of the manor of Brougham, probably by 
marriage of a coheirefs.

And again in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the in- 
quifition finds, that John Godbert, William Crackenthop, and Henry de Reddings 
then held the manor of Brougham.
It is probable, that Robert de Crackenthorp, who married the heirefs of New- 
biggin, was ion of this William.
In ;he 14 Ed. 3.
the faid Robert de Crackenthorp prefented to the rectory of 
Newbiggin one John de Hale, on a vacancy by the death of the aforefaid 
Thomas Newbigging.
And three years after, he prefented one Gilbert de Tindale to the faid rectory, 
being void by refignation.
And foon after he died; leaving, by his faid wife 
Emmade Newbiggin, a fon and heir, 
9. William de Crackenthorp ; who in the 18 Ed. 3.
together with John Tyndal 
and John Trotter, held the manor of Brougham.
In the 38 Ed. 3.
William de Crackenthorp prefented one Thomas de Appleby to 
the rectory of Newbiggin, being vacant by the refignation of Robert de 
Jppleby.
And in the 41 Ed. 3.
on the refignation of Thomas de Appleby, the faid 
William prefented one Sir Robert de Merton.
In the 49 Ed. 3.
the faid William made a fettlement of his eftate (perhaps 
on the marriage of his fon) -, in which fettlement, Robert de Merton, rector 
of the church of St. Edmund of Newbiggins, is a truftee.
In the fame year, Robert de Merton refigned his living, and Sir John de 
Culwen was prefented and inftituted.
And prefently he exchanged, with 
Roger de Kirk Ofwald, for the vicarage of Bromfield â€¢, whereupon the faid Ro- 
ger was prefented by the faid William de Crackenthorp, and inftituted.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that John de Tyndall and William de Crackenthorp held two parts of the manor 
of Brougham.
The faid William, by his wife who was of the name of Grimfton, had a 
fon and heir, 
10.
John de Crackenthorp, who married a daughter of Brifco.
In the 5 Ric. 2.
during his father's life-time, he ferved for the county of Weftmorland in par- 
liament ; and was allowed, for his charges during his attendance for twenty 
days, 12/.
In the 9 and 13 Ric. 2.
he was again returned for the fame county.
. In the 16 Ric. 2.
he ferved again for the fame county, and had an allowance 
of 18/, for 28 days attendance.
In the 21 Ric. 2.
he appears to have been under fheriff of the faid county.
And in the 1 Hen. 4.
he was knight of the fhire for the faid county, aad 
had an allowance of 26/ 16s o^for fixty-three days attendance.
He had a fon and heir,

John de Crackenthorp, who married a Blencow.
This John had a brother William, who in the 18 Ric. 2.
was elected one of 
the knights of the fhire for Weftmorland, and had 19/ 12 sod allowed for 
49 days.
In the 2 1 Ric. 2.

Which Robert, in the 1 Hen. 5.
ferved for the

The faid John de Crackenthorp by the inquifition poft mortem of John de Clif-

"John de Crackenthorp, who married a Leyburn.
In the 5 Hen. 6.
we find 
this John, who is called John de Crackenthorp the younger (his father being 
then living), receiver to the lady Elizabeth (Piercy), widow of John lord 
Clifford, of her revenues in Weftmorland.
Thomas Crackenthorp, brother of this Johv, in the 27 Hen. 6.
ferved the of- 
fice of fheriff for Cumberland ; and in the 29 Hen. 6.
reprefented the county 
of Cumberland in parliament.
The faid Thomas, as alfo his brother James, 
engaging on the part of the houfe of Lancafter againft that of York (as did 
almoft all the northern nobility and gentry) in the then civil wars, were (lain 
in the great battle of Towton-field, together with their general John lord 
Clifford.
In the 3 1 Hen. 6.
John Crackenthorp de Newbiggin, together with two others, 
appears by inquifition to have then held the manor of Brougham : from which 
fpecial designation of the place, there can be no doubt but that the Cracken- 
thorps of Brougham and Newbiggin w-ere the fame family.
The faid John died in the 6 Ed. 4.
leaving a fon and heir,

John de Crackenthorp, who married a Mufgrave.
â€” In the 20 Hen. 7.
John Crackenthorp, William Bird, and John Burgham held the manor of

In the 4th, and again in the 5th of Hen. 8.
John Crackenthorp was fheriff 
of Cumberland.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
he, and two others, held the manor of Brougham.
The faid John, befides his fon and heir Chrijiophcr, feems to have had a 
younger fon William, to whom he gave the faid third part of the manor of 
Brougham : For in the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, Margaret widow of William 
Crackenthorp and John their fon and heir held the third part of the faid manor 
of Brougham.
And after this, we find the name no more at Brougham.

There is an ile on the north fide, which belongs to the lord of the 
manor and patron of the living; and feems to have been the ancient burying 
place of the family.
But in the year 1686 there was another place aftigned â€¢, 
and on the fouth wall was put up this diftich, in the fame ftyle of poetry as the 
infcription over the hall-door : 
This place is affigned here as you fee

fenters 3.
Upon the rocks, at a place called Crawdundale in this parim, were for- 
merly found characters and ancient infcriptions, all of which are now oblite- 
rated and mouldered away by length of time.
Mr. Camden takes notice of 
one, the former part whereof was not legible, but in the other part was to be 
feen the name of Varronius commander of the 20th legion ; and another, in 
which was the name of Mlius Lucanus commander of the 2d legion.
The 20th 
legion, he fays, was quartered at Deva, now called Weft-Chefter ; and the 
2d legion was quartered at Ifca, now Caerleon, in Wales ; and might be drawn 
into thefe parts, for the defence thereof.
The exact time hereof is not eafily 
to be fet down ; yet in order to the pointing out the very time, Mr. Camden 
obferves, that there was to be feen in a rock near adjoining, in capital letters, 
the name of Cneius Otlavius Cotta, conful, (CN.

all the confular rolls he owns he could meet with no fuch name.

not fupported by fo refpectable an authority, one might be tempted to conclude 
that fome part thereof might be owing to flxength of imagination.

And it is

I. PARISH OF KIRKBY THORE.
TTTrkby Thore is fo called from a temple anciently dedicated to the great* 
;*â–  â–  idol of the Pagan-Saxons, called Thor ; which was of more eftimation 
among them, than any of the reft of their idols.
This was majeftically placed 
in a very fpacious hall, and there fet as if he had repofed himfelf upon a co- 
vered bed.
On his head this idol wore a crown of gold, and round in com- 
pafs above and about the fame, were fet or fixed 12 bright burnifhed golden 
liars--, and in his right hand he held a kingly fcepter.
He was efteemed the 
god of thunder-, and every Thurfday was weekly dedicated unto his peculiar 
fervice, from whence that day received its name.
Mr. Camden fuppofes this place to be the Gallagim of the Romans-, but 
Mr. Horfley with more probability fixes xhzGallagum at Appleby, and proves 
this place to have been the Roman Brovonace.
This parifh is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Dufton and Marton -, 
on the South, by the parishes of St. Michael's Appleby, Moiiand, and Clib- 
burn -, on the Weft, by the parifh of Brougham -.
and on the North, by the 
parifhes of Kirkland, Newbiggin, and Alilon : And contains about 146 fa- 
milies -, whereof, dilTenters 6.
The church is dedicated to St. Michael.
It is a rectory, valued in the 
king's books at 37/ lys \\d.
The patron is the right honourable the earl 
of Thanet, by hereditary defcent from Robert de Veteripont, who purchafed 
the fame of the then lord of the manor.
The original purchafe-deed is ftill at 
Appleby caftle, whereby Adam fon of Waldeve of Kirkby Thore grants to 
Robert de Veteripont the advowfon of the church of Kirkby Thore, with all 
the liberties and dignities to the faid church belonging, as well in the chapels 
of Soureby and Milleburn, as in lands and other pofferTions.
Bifhop Nicolfon takes notice of a remarkable inftance in the year 1280, of

to vacant benefices, in the very firft year of his prelacy ; for he then certifies 
the bifhop of Bath and Wells, then lord chancellor, that there had been no 
divine fervice in the church of Kirkby Thore in eight years part, by reafon of 
a papal interdict ; which being for not admitting a foreigner to a provifion, 
and the church under a lay patronage, he hopes the king will refent it.
(Pryn.

1231.)- But it is obfervable, that though the bifhop here admits 
the papal provifions to benefices under lay patronages to be incroachments on 
the royal authority, yet he fays nothing of the like difpofal of thofe that are 
the property of ecclefiaftical patrons, who were fuppofed to be more the pope's 
fubjects than the king's ; for in truth he himfelf held his bifhoprick by a pa- 
pal provifion, without the king's confent.
In the year 1343, one Roger de Clifford was rector of Kirkby Thore â€¢, who 
being grown very old and infirm, had one Sir Thomas Paytefun (a prieft) af- 
figned to him for an affiftant, both in fpirituals and temporals.
And two years after, Ralph de Brantingham was prefented to the vacant rec- 
tory of Kirkby Thore, by king Edward the third, in right of Robert fon and 
heir of Robert lord Clifford, then an infant, and the king's ward.
In 13549 on the refignation of one Thomas de Riplyngham, the faid king pre- 
fented Adam de Hoton in right of the faid Robert, being not yet of age.
In 1362, on the death of the faid Adam de Hoton, William de Corbrigg was 
prefented by Roger de Clifford lord of Weftmorland.
The fame year this 
William had licence of abfence for a year to purfue his fludies, and letters di- 
miffory for orders.
The like licence was afterwards renewed to him for three 
years.
The faid William appears to have been rector in 1335, which was the 
48 Ed. 3.
In the reign of king Henry the fixtb, Roger de Crackenthorp (one of the New- 
biggin family) was rector.
In the reign of Edward the fourth, Henry Wherton^ a younger fon of Gilbert 
de Wherton lord of the manor of Kirkby Thore, was rector.

Richard Evenwode, abbot of Shap, was prefented by 
Henry earl of Cumberland, on the refignation of Richard Raw/on, to whom 
he was to pay a yearly penfion of 30/ during his life.
In this Richard Evenwode's time, who was both abbot and rector, this church 
narrowly efcaped an appropriation to Shap abbey.
The writings were drawn, 
the money advanced, all requifite confents obtained, and nothing prevented 
the completion thereof but the diffolution of the abbey *.

The great bell at Kirkby Thore, which is the largeft in the county, (but 
hath been burft long ago) is faid to have been brought thither from Shap 
abbey : Which, by reafon of the connexion at that time of the rector of 
Kirkby Thore with the abbey, is not improbable : And the fleeple at Kirkby 
Thore feems not to have been made for fuch a bell.
Richard Evenwode feems to have been fucceeded by Michael Crackenthorp â€¢,

On Michael Crackenthorp's death, Robert Warthcoppe was inftituted on the

MANOR OF KIRKBY THORE..
1. The firft lord of the manor of Kirkby Thore that we have met with was 
Whelp, who lived about the reign of king Stephen or Henry the fecond.
From him probably, or one of his anceftors, Whelp-cafth had its name.
2. He had a fon Gamel.
Which Game!

3. Waldeve; who granted divers lands at Kirkby Thore and Hale to ths 
abbey of Holm Cultram ; with common of pafture for 400 ewes, 20 rams, 
and the lambs of the firft year â€¢, and as many oxen, fows> and horfes, as they 
fliall need for their houfhold and tillage â€¢, and for fix cows, one boar, and their 
young till one year old *.
Which grant was confirmed by Lyulph fon of 
Lyulph, who feems to have held one fourth part of the manor under the faid 
Waldeve - x for in his charter of confirmation he ftyles the faid Waldeve his 
lord.

And by another charter he releafes to the faid abbey all his right and claim,

4. This Waldeve had two fons Adam and Alan.
Adam the elder brother,

This is that Adam de Kirkby Thore who granted the advowlon of the church 
to Robert de Veteripont as aforefaid.

divers lands at Kirkby Thore, which grant was confirmed by Adam his lord

The faid Gilbert was living in the 14 Ed. 1.

de Broy releafed to them certain rights and claims which he had there ; and 
made an exchange with them of divers lands, whereof the Maiden way is ex- 
prefled to be one of the bounder marks J : And Amabil daughter of Robert de 
Bereford executed to the faid abbey a like releafe.
Alio John de Veteripont gave certain lands there to the faid abbey ; and the 
faid John, as lord of Weftmorland, of whom this manor was holden in chief, 
granted to the inhabitants of Kirkby Thore freedom from pulture of his fo- 
re fters in Weftmorland, and from finding teftimony to his forefters which is 
called witnejjman \ and that if they fhall be found guilty of offences in hunting 
or vert, they fhall not be called to account for the fame in any of his courts 
of the foreft, but only in the county court.
6. After Gilbert, the next that we find was John de Kirkby Wore (probably 
fon of Gilbert) ; who in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, is 
found by inquifition to have held of the faid Robert the manor of Kirkby 
Thore; the wardfhip whereof, when it mould happen, was valued at 10/ a 
year, and the cornage thereof was 32 J 6d.
In the 9 Ed. 2.
and again in the 14 Ed. 3.
John de Kirkby Thore was knight 
of the fhire for Weftmorland.
7. In the 43 Ed. 3.
and alfo in the 15 Ric. 2.
John de Kirkby Thore held the 
manor of Kirkby Thore.
8. So, in the 10 Hen. 5.
John de Kirkby Thore held the fame.
9. In the 31 Hen. 6.
it is found by inquifition as follows : Gilbert de Kirkby 
Thore heretofore held 3 parts of Kirkby Thore, and paid yearly for cornage 
19 j 10 d â– , and owed wardfhip, marriage, and relief.
And now John de Kirkby 
Thore holds the fame 3 parts by all the fervices aforefaid ; and makes fine by 
fuit to the county court, notwithftanding that the lord of Weftmorland releafed 
to one of his anceftors the faid fuit.
â€” And Robert de Berford heretofore held 
immediately the 4th part of the fame vill of Kirkby Thore, and paid yearly 
for cornage 12 j 8 d, and owed wardfhip, marriage, and relief.
And now 
Ralph Pud/ay knight, lord of Berford upon Teys, holds immediately the fame 
4th part, by the fervices aforefaid.
And John Wherton holds the faid 4th pare 
of the faid knight, by all the fervices aforefaid *.
And this is the firft introduction of the Whartons to Kirkby Thore.
They 
claim to be defcended from a younger branch of the Whartons of Wharton- 
hall ; which probably may be true (although they do not clearly make out the 
connexion) : And to this day they bear the arms of the Whartons of Wharton, 
viz.
Sable, a manch Argent; with a crefcent above the manch, by way of 
diftinction of the younger branch: The creft; On a wreath, a bull's head 
erafed.
1. This John Wharton we affume as the firft of that family at Kirkby Thore.
In the 17 Ed. 4.
we find Margaret daughter of John Wharton of Kirkby 
Thore efquire married to William fon of Thomas Wybergh of Clifton 
efquire.

2. Next unto John, we find Gilbert Wharton of Kirkby Thore efquiic, who 
had a younger fon Henry (as we obferved before) rector there.
And in the 
reign of Henry the feventh, Gilbert Wharton of Kirkby Thore was, with others, 
collector of the fubfidy in Weftmorland.
3. In the 14 Hen. 7.
we find John Wharton of Kirkby Thore efquire, pro- 
bably fon of Gilbert.
4. This John had a fon Gilbert : For in the 4 Hen. 8.
Gilbert, fon and heir 
of John Wharton of Kirkby Thore, did (by way of fettlement) grant to Tho- 
mas Warcop of Colby efquire and others, all his manors, demefnes, lands, 
tenements, rents, and fervices, in Kirkby Thore, Brampton, and eliewhere in 
Weftmorland; and all his lands, tenements, rents, and fervices, in Cumrewe, 
and Aleby-field in Gilfland, one clofe called Bartyn Park in the barony of 
Grayftocke with one tenement contiguous thereunto, and alfo the reverfion of 
all his lands and tenements in GlafTenby and elfewhere, in the county of Cum- 
berland ; to the ufe of Katherine his wife during the minority of his fon and 
heir John, and after her deceafe to the joint heirs of himfelf and the faid Ka- 
therine, remainder to his own right heirs.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
the faid Gilbert appears to have held 3 parts of Kirkby 
Thore as aforefaid.
And Thomas Pudfey of Bereford upon Teis held the 
4th part, which 4th part the faid Gilbert held of Thomas Pudfey.
And tv/enty years afcer this, we find the faid Gilbert and his fon John both 
living.
For in the laft year of the reign of Hen. 8.
John Wharton, fon and 
heir apparent of Gilbert Wharton, was truftee in a marriage fettlement of a 
daughter of Hugh Machel to the fon of Richard Machel gentlemen, both of 
Crackenthorp.
5. In the 18 Eliz.
we find John Wharton efquire in a lift of fubfcribers to the 
building of Temple Sowerby bridge.
And this John probably had a fon, 
6. John Wharton of Kirkby Thore efquire -, for in the pedigree of the Whan- 
tons of Kirkby Thore, certified at Sir William Dugdale's vifitation in 1.664, 
the firft in the lift (except two Johns in the reign of Hen. 7.) re John Whar- 
ton efquire, who married Cicely daughter of Sir Nicholas Thornburgh of 
Celihed in the county of Lancafter knight, and died (as is there faid) in 1600.
[Indeed, thefe heraldic pedigrees, efpecially at any confiderable diftance of 
time, are generally very imperfect, and contradicted for the molt part by re- 
cords, where we have been fo fortunate as to meet with fuch.
It was impof* 
fible for the heralds to judge in moft cafes of their authenticity, and the perfon 
certifying the fame might not be perfectly acquainted with the antiquities of

He married to his fecond wife, Bridget daughter of Robert Teafdale

8. John Wharton efquire, fon and heir of Thomas, married Katherine 
daughter of Chriftopher Wyvill fon and heir apparent of Sir Marmaduke Wy- 
vill of Conftable Burton in the county of York baronet, and by her had iflue 
John, Stephen, Henry, Chriftopher, Philip, Thomas, Mary, Ifabel, Jane,

He died in 1648.
9. John Wharton efquire, fon of John, married Anne daughter of Richard 
Crackenthorp of Little Strickland gentleman.
He was of the age of 37 at 
Dugdale's vifitation aforefaid ; and had then three daughters, Bridget, Jane, 
and Anne.
And it feemeth that he had no more children afterwards.
For 
he cut off the intail, and (to raife portions for his daughters) fold the eftate to 
his coufin Humphrey Wharton of Gilling efquire, barrifter at law.
10.
The faid Humphrey Wharton had iflue only one fon, viz.

Humphrey Wharton of Gilling efquire, who married a daughter of Byerley 
of Grainge in the county of Durham efquire, and by her had iflue Humphrey, 
Robert, Chriftopher, and Anthony, and three daughters.
Of the fons, 
Humphrey, Robert, and Chriftopher, died without iflue, and the fourth fon 
Anthony fucceeded to the inheritance.

Hickesof the county of Eflex, and by her had iflue (1) William.

who married and died leaving iflue two daughters, viz.
Anne married to John

William Wharton of Gilling efquire fucceeded his father, and died with- 
out ifllie, leaving coheirs the prefent owners his filters Margaret and Mary and 
the daughters of his filter Anne.
The hall or manor houfe, as alfo mod part of the prefent town (Mr. Machel 
fays), have been built out of the ruins of Whelp Cajlle â€¢, of which there are now 
fcarce any remains.
The main body of it hath ftood (as may be conjectured, 
he fays, from the ruins under ground) in a place called the Burwens, on a 
rifing ground, at the bank of the rivulet called Troutbeck, and not far from 
the river Eden.
The fquare inclofure, called the High Burwens, feems to 
have been the area of it, containing 8 fcore yards in diameter, now ploughed 
and cultivated ; and the outer buildings, mantle, and gardens, to have run 
down along the faid rivulet at leaft as far as the fulling-mill, and poffibly fur- 
ther, beyond the high ftreet or Roman way ; thence up the weft fide of the 
faid ftreet about 8 fcore yards, and thence up again in a ftraight line to the 
weft angle of the faid area.
For in all thefe places the veftigia of it may be 
difcovered, by conduits under ground ; fubterraneous vaults ; fair pavements 
of floors made with flags â€¢, tiles, and flates, with iron nails in them, by which 
they have been faftened : but principally, by the foundations of walls, both of 
brick and ftone ; as alfo by coins, altars, and urns, with other fictilia, often 
found thereabouts.

The faid Mr. Machel, in the year 1687, in a fearch there, found amongd 
the rifled foundations a fourfold wall, made up of four walls jumped together, 
and as it were united into one.
They were made of hewn ftone, each wall 
being two foot and four inches thick, fo that the whole was nine foot and four 
inches.
The outermoft wall was ftrongly cemented to the very foundation 
with the belt Roman mortar, feeming to be a compofition of lime, gravel, 
and brick.
The other three had their foundations firlt laid in clay, and then 
in a coarfer fort of lime.
And underneath all, was a pavement of cobble 
Hones, to make the foundation more firm and durable.
In another part he found an altar FORTVNAE SERVATR1CI.
Some leaden pipes alfo were found j and a drain made through the quadruple 
wall to carry off the water.
There were alio found divers chambers, or arched vaults, under ground ; 
with floors flagged with (lone, or paved with brick.
The bricks for the pave- 
ment Were generally about ten inches fquare, and two inches deep : though 
fome were a foot fquare and 2f inches deep.
All which do loudly proclaim the fame to have been Roman: As alfo the 
ancient Roman way, which branches off here, called the Maiden-way, and ter- 
minates at Caervorran in Northumberland near the Picts wall, for the length 
of near 20 miles, through fells, waftes, and moors.
Along which ftreer, it is 
generally thought, were placed thofe ftations and manfions mentioned by An- 
tonine in the ninth Itinerary.
â€” And it is obfervable, that the gill at the other 
end of the Maiden-way near Caervorran is called Glen-Whelp (now by corrup- 
tion Glen Welt).
There was an ancient well difcovered by the faid Mr. Machel, at the low 
end of the town near the bridge, by the fide of the great Roman way leading 
from Appleby to Carlifle.
In which were found urns, and feveral curious fine 
earthen veflels-, the cufp of a fpear â€¢, and fandais, whofe foles were ftuck full 
of nails, and fewed together, not with thread, but with leather : Moll of 
which were carefully preferved, defigned, and defcribed in a letter from the 
faid Mr. Machel to Sir William Dugdale, and printed in the Philofophicai 
Tran factions Apr. 20, 1684.

MANOR OF TEMPLE SOWERBY.
Below Kirkby Thore, and adjoining thereto on the north-weft, lies Temple 
Sowerby ; fo called by way of diftinclion, from its having belonged heretofore 
to the Knights Templars : for there are two Sowerbys in the bottom of Weft- 
morland, the other being called Brough Sowerby.
Before this place was granted to the Templars, it feems to have been called 
Sowerby only, without any other name of diftinclion.
And we find feveral 
perfons deriving their name from thence, as Adam de Soureby, William de 
Soureby, Hugh de Soureby, and others.
But whether any of this name, or who 
elfe, were then lords of the manor, hath not appeared to us.
The Knights Templars became firft eftabliflied in England about the reign 
of king Stephen, who began his reign in the year 1135.
When or by whom 
this manor was granted to the Templars, we have not found.
The lords of 
this manor claim and exercife for themfelves and their tenants, feveral privi- 
leges which heretofore belonged to the Knights Templars, who had large pof- 
feffions in this kingdom â€¢, which privileges were granted to them by a charter 
of king Henry the third.
Which faid king, for the love of God, and for 
the health of the foul of king John his father, and of the fouls of all his an- 
ceftors and fuccefibrs, grants to the fraternity of the Knights Templars as fol- 
lows: " That they fball hold all their poiTcffions, with all liberties, free cuf- 
" toms and quietances, in wood and in plain, in meadows and paftures, in 
" waters and mills, in ways and paths, in lakes and ponds, in marfhes and 
" fifheries, in granges and woods, with foe, and fac, and tol, and theam, 
" and infangthief, and outfangchief, and hamfoken, and grithbrich, and blod- 
" wite, and fledwite, and flitwite, and ferdwite, and hengwite, and Icirwite, 
" and flemenefrith, and fines for murder and robbery, forftall, ordell, and 
" orefte : That they fhall be free from aids of kings, theriffs, and their offi- 
" cers, and from hidage, and carucage, and danegeld, and homgeld, and

Other privileges the lords of this manor have fometimes afTerted, which are 
clearly without foundation ; fuch as appointing overfeers of the poor, furveyors 
of the highways, and the like-, which offices did not exift till fome hundreds 
of years after the granting of the above mentioned privileges, nor till after 
the diffolution of the Templars, Hofpitallers, and every other of the religious 
focieties.
The Templars were difTolved in the year 1312; and, eleven years after, 
their pofTeffions were by act of parliament given to the Knights Hofpitallers.
In the intermediate fpace, we find Temple Sowerby held by Robert lord 
Clifford by way of efcheat.
For by an inquifition after the death of the faid 
Robert, who died in the year next after the diffolution of the Templars, we 
find that the faid Robert died feifed in his demefne as of fee, of certain te- 
nements in Temple Sowerby, as his efcheats, by the diffolution of the Tem- 
plars ; which he held of the king in capite by knights fervice : And there were

Sir John Lowther of Lowther.
This Chriftopher, about the i6Eliz.
had a 
difpute with the tenants of Temple Sowerby concerning their cuftom of te- 
nant right ; whereupon it was decreed by the lord prefident and council at 
York for the northern parts, with the confent of the laid Chriftopher, that for 
the ending of controverfies, a divifion fhould be made of the feveral mef- 
fuages, lands, and tenements in Temple Sowerby, by arbitrators chofen for 
that purpofe ; who did thereupon award, that the tenants fhould have their 
houfes and buildings, tofts, ciofts, garths, and orchards to their feveral mef- 
fuages and tenements belonging, with the moiety or one half of all their arable 
lands, meadows, feedings, commons, pafture, and other the premiffes to 
their feveral mefiuages and tenements appertaining; and the faid Chriftopher 
Dalfton thereupon to make them leafes of their feveral mefiuages, lands, and 
tenements for icco years, referving the rent of four marks yearly, every one 
to pay according to the rate and quality of his farmhold.
The faid Chriftopher had iffue, 
3. Thomas Dalfton of Uldale efquire.
He married Jane daughter of one 
Philips of Brignall in the county of York.
He died in 1611 ; leaving iffue,

The ancient manor houfe is Acorn-bank before mentioned, fo called from 
the afcent towards it being heretofore covered with oak wood, of which there 
are yet to be feen flumps of prodigious thicknefs.
It is a neat houfe, much 
improved by the late John Dalfton efquire ; and the wood being now cleared 
away from before it, there is an extenfive and delightful profpect of the coun- 
try all about, except only towards the north.
The chapel at Temple Sowerby is lately rebuilt, in a very handfome manner.
In the year 1338, there is an entry in the bifhop's regifter of a confirmation 
of an old award made by Ralph de Irton bifhop of Carlifle, between the pa- 
rifhioners of Kirkby Thore and the inhabitants of Temple Sowerby; whereby 
it is declared, that the latter are and fhall be (as they have ever been) free 
from contributing any thing towards the repairs of the church, belfrey, or 
churchyard walls at Kirkby Thore : Saving that if hereafter it fhall be thought 
necefTary to inlarge the nave or body or the church, they fhall then bear a 
third part of the expence.

and he and his fuccefTors are made guarantees of it.

the chapel of

Sowerby, the profits whereof to be employed in keeping in repair the two 
tombs of her mother and herfelf in Appleby church, in repairing the fchool

other principal inhabitants of the county ; more particularly of thofe within

MANOR OF MIL BURN E.
North-eaft from Temple Sowerby and Kirkby Thore, lies the manor of 
Mileurne, fo called probably from a water mill on the rivulet there.
This 
is the mod northern village in the county ; and is divided from Blencarne 
in Cumberland by the water called Blencarne beck, which taketh its courfe by 
Newbiggin, Acorn-bank, and fo into Eden, and divides all along in its courfe 
thefe two counties.
Milburne contains in it Kirkhoufe, a fmall hamlet holden of the rectors of 
Kirkby Thore (unto which the name feemeth to refer), wherein the chapel is 
fituate ; Gullom Holme, another fmall hamlet â€¢, Milburne and Grange, two hand- 
fome villages; which are all holden of Howgillcaftle, the ancient feat of the 
lords of the manor.
The firft account that we have of this particular manor, is in the reign of 
king John ; which faid king granted to William de Stuteville the For eft of 
Milburne.
Afterwards Nicholas de Stuteville granted to Robert de Veteripont the whole 
village and grange of Milneburne, as William de Stuteville or his anceftors 
had held the fame.
The faid Robert granted part thereof to Shap abbey-, namely, the whole 
village of the grange of Milneburne.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
we find that earl Patrick of Dunbar held Milneburne of the 
Cliffords ; that is, that part of it which had not been granted away to rhe 
abbey.
And at the fame time, Thomas de Halteclo and Adam Garnet held 
the refidue (probably in the name of the abbey), rendring for the fame 4/.
And in the 8 Ed. 2.
we find die fame earl Patrick holding Milneburne â€¢, of 
which the wardfhip was rated at 61 1 3 j ^d, and the cornage was2ii 8 d.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
it was found by inquifition, that Bertrine de Johnby and 
Robert deVallibus had held the manor of Milneburne of one Patrick earl of 
Dunbar-, which Patrick held the fame of Robert de Clifford, and the faid 
Robert de Clifford held the fame of the king in capite by knights fervice.
And 
afterwards the faid earl Patrick forfeited the fame to king Edward grandfather 
of the prefent king, for adhering to Robert de Bruce king of Scotland, enemy 
of our lord the king.
After this came in the family of the Lancafters (perhaps by grant from the 
crown after the faid forfeiture).
In order to deduce which family, we mull 
recur to the ancient barons of Kendal.
William de hancofter the third of that 
name, baron of Kendal, had a baftard brother (as we mentioned before), 
whofe name was Roger.
This Roger de Lancafter had three fons, "John, Wil- 
liam, and Chrijlopher.
From Chrtftopher the youngeft iffued the family of the 
Lancafters of Sockbridge.
John the eldeft, by the name of John de Lan- 
caftre of Holgill, in the iff and again in the 2d of Ed. 3.
was chofen to re- 
prefent the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
He died in the 8 Ed. 2.
without ifllie male ; whereupon his eftate went over to the next heir male of

the family, namely, to John de Lane -after, fon of the fecond brother William.
This John de Lancafter died in the 25 Ed. 3.
and was fticceeded by his fon, 
Sir William de Lancajler of Howgill knight.
This Sir William, in the 
$% Ed. 3.
had a licence from the bifliop of Carlille for a chaplain for that year 
in his family.
He died in the 22 Ric. 2.
leaving ifllie, 
Sir William; who died in the 8 Hen. 4.
leaving iifue, 
Sir John de Lancajler of Howgill knight.
In the 8 Hen. 4.
and again in the 
9 Hen. 5.
he represented the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
by the inquifition poft mortem of John lord Clifford, the 
jurors find, that John de Lancaftre held the manor of Milneburn, by the corn- 
age of 21 s 8 d; and alfo divers lands and tenements there, for which he paid 
4/ for all fervices.
This Sir John died in the reign of Hen. 6.
leaving four 
daughters coheirs, 1.
Chrijlian, married to Sir Robert de Harrington knight.
2. I fab el, married to Sir Thomas le Fleming of Conifton knight.
3. Margaret, 
married to Sir Matthew de Whitfield knight.
And, 4.
Elizabeth, married to 
Robert de Crackenthorp efquire, a younger brother of the Crackenthorps of 
Newbiggin.
And in the partition of the eftate, in the 16th year of the fame 
king, Chrijlian and Elizabeth were to have the manors of Depedale, Blencoyne, 
Holgyl, and Knock Salcok, and the lands there, as alfo in Milneburn and 
Lowenthwaite ; and Margaret and Ifabel were to have the manor of Rydal, and 
all the lands and tenements in Rydal and Loughrigg.
â€” â€” The arms of thefe 
Lancaflers were ; Argent, two bars Gules, on a canton of the fecond a lion 
paffant guardant Or.
' In the divifion between Chrijlian and Elizabeth, Howgill fell to Elizabeth, who 
thereupon brought the fame in marriage to Robert de Crackenthorp.
This Robert had a fon Ambrofe Crackenthorp efquire ; which Ambrofe was 
one of the arbitrators in the 5 Hen.

between the chantry prieft of Appleby 
and Hugh Machel of Crackenthorp gentleman, concerning the faid Hugh's

The faid Ambrofe died without iflue male ; 
and was fucceeded by his brother, 
Anthony Crackenthorp of Howgill efquire ; who had only three daughters, 
Anne, Margaret, and Cicely.
Of whom Anne the eldeft, who had Howgill for her purparty, was married 
to Sir Thomas Sandford of Afkham knight ; and thereby brought this manor to 
the Sandfords.
This Sir Thomas Sandford, by his wife Anne Crackenthorp, had a fon Thomas 
who fucceeded him at Afkham ; a fecond fon Henry, who married Agnes 
daughter of Gervafe Strickland ; and a third fon, viz.
Richard Sandford efquire, who removed to Howgill-caftle.
He married 
Anne daughter of John Warriner of Helfington, and by her had 1 8 children ; 
of whom, the eldeft was, 
Sir Thomas Sandford of Howgill knight ; who died without ifllie : And was 
fucceeded by his brother, 
Sir Richard Sandford of Howgill knight ; who married Anne daughter of 
Henry Crackenthorp of Newbiggin efquire, and widow of Pennington of

Sir Thomas Sandford baronet ; who married Bridget daughter of Sir George 
Dalfton of Dalfton knight, and had iflue Richard, George, William, Anne, 
Elizabeth, and Catharine, befides ten other children who died young.
Sir Richard Sandford baronet, fon and heir of Sir Thomas, married Mary 
daughter of Sir Francis Bowes knight, and had iflue Mary and Richard.
He 
was murdered at London, Sept.
X, ^^TS-> by Henry Symbal and William 
Jones, who were executed for the fame ; of which there was a printed account 
in the year 1680.
Sir Richard Sandford baronet, fon of the laft Sir Richard, was born (it is faid) 
in the very fame hour in which his father died.
He died unmarried ; and was 
fucceeded by his filter and heir, 
Mary, who was married to Robert Honywood of Mark's Hall in Efiex efquire, 
and had iflue Richard, John, and Philip.
Richard left iflue a fon, who died in 
his minority.
John died without iffue.
Whereupon the inheritance defcended 
to the third brother, the prefent owner, viz.
Philip Honywood efquire lieutenant general of his majefty's forces.
Howgill castle, which is the manor houfe, is a fair building, which 
ftands high on the fkirts of the mountains in the eye of the country, and hath 
a large profpect to the fouth and fouth-weft â€¢, but is fhut up by mountains on 
the north.
The walls were formerly, and fome of them are yet, io{- foot thick 
(which exceeds the dimenfion of the Picts wall, which was only 8 or 9 foot).
And underneath the dwelling- houfe (to which they afcended by flairs on the 
outfide) were vaults and cellars, arched over with ftone â€¢, which was the com- 
mon way of building in the northern parts, whilft they were in continual ap- 
prehenfions of the Scots â€¢, and ferved not only to the ufe which they are now 
put to, but to keep their horfes and cattle fecure.
In this manor, near to a place called Green Cajlle (which is a round fort 
with deep trenches about it, on the fouth end of Dunfell) was an altar found 
with this infcription, DEO S1LVANO.
In the mountains are outburfts of coals, which the country people fome- 
times pick out for burning lime.
There is alfo lead ore, which difcovers itfelf 
in the banks of rivulets.
Befides the chapel, there feems to have been a chantry at Milburne.
For 
Robert de Veteripont gave Milburne Grange aforefaid to Shap abbey, for the 
purpofe of eftablifhing a chantry (pro cantaria facienda) % and the chapel was 
there before, as appears from the grant of Adam de Kirkby Thore to the faid 
Robert.
But it is not unlikely, that this neverthelefs might be intended as an 
augmentation to the chapel ; and that for the faid benefaction, the abbot and 
convent fhould find a chaplain, who, befides the ordinary fervice, fhould alfo 
pray (as ufual) for the fouls of the founder and his kindred.
And it feemeth, 
that out of the faid grange the abbey was to pay for the purpofe aforefaid 4/ 
yearly, that being the fum fpecified in the inquifition in the 3 Ed. 2.
aforefaid:

Which was a confiderable fum in thofe days.
And this could not beany fum 
payable to the Cliffords as lords paramount of the manor ; for the whole corn- 
age of the whole manor was only 21 s yd.
But if this was the cafe, the abbey had found fome means to throw this 
charge upon the reftor â€¢, for in the valuation in the firft fruits office, in the 
26 Hen. 8.
the chantry at Milburne is faid to be worth yearly 4/, in a penfion 
by the rector of Kirkby Thore.
And in the reign of queen Elizabeth this appears to have been advanced 
further ; for in the accounts of the profits of the rectory in the years 1572 and 
1573, there is fet down as a deduction, to Sir John Spedding curate at Mil- 
burne, for each year 4/ 13 s ^d.
This chapel harh been twice augmented by the countefs dowager Gower, 
with 200/ each time, which procured 400/ from the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty, wherewith lands were purchafed in Dillaker, Firbank, Howgill, and 
Bolton, of the prefent yearly value of 34/.
In the faid chapel, in what is called the Sandford ile, there is a monument 
of Anne wife of Richard Sandford of Howgill-cattle efquire aforefaid, who 
had 18 children, and died Jan. 29, 1605,

The parifh of Brougham is bounded on the eaft by the parifh of Kirkby 
Thore ; on the fouth, by the parishes of Clibburn and Clifton â€¢, on the weft, 
by the parishes of Barton and Penrith ; and on the north, by the parifh of 
Edenhall.
It is a reclory, valued in the king's books at 16I 10s jid; in the patronage 
of the earl of Thanet.
The church of Brougham Hands in a beautiful fituation, nigh the river 
Eamont, at a great diftance from any inhabitants â€¢, one half of the village hav- 
ing been purchafed (as will appear afterwards) by theownersof Whinfell park, 
to inlarge their boundary on that fide â€¢, after which, for the eafe and benefit 
of the inhabitants of the oppofite part, on that fide next unto the caftle, the 
chapel feems to have been erected.
Of which remaining part, Mr. James Bird, 
about a century ago, purchaied a confiderable number of tenements, to make 
room for his demefne.
So that now there are not much above 2Â© families in 
the whole parifh.
The church is vulgarly called Ninekirks, fuppofed to have been dedicated to 
St. Ninian, a Scottifh faint, to which kingdom probably this church did be- 
long at the time of the dedication: It is fometimes called the church of St.
Wilfrid : Thus one Thomas de Derby, rector of Brougham in the reign of 
king Edward the third, bequeathed his body to be buried in the church of 
St. Wilfrid de Burgham.
And in the year 1637, Sir Robert de Wolflay, rector 
of Merton, in his will requefted, that his body might be interred in the church 
of St. Wilfrid de Burgham, and bequeathed 26s 8 d to purchafe a book for the 
faid church.
So that we muft either fuppofe that the Scots had one tutelar 
faint of the church, and the Englilh another â€¢, or rather perhaps that this latter 
is the faint of the chapel, which indeed is not fo properly a chapel of eafe un- 
der the mother church, as another church (as it were) within the fame parifh; 
for there is not the rector to officiate in the parifh church, and a curate in the 
chapel, but the rector officiates in both at different times and on different 
occafions.
In the year 1393, it is faid that there was an agreement between Thomas 
. Reding lord of the manor of Brougham, and Edward Skelling then rector, 
concerning 
PARISH OF BROUGHAM.
39 i 
concerning frequent prayers to be had in the chapel of Brougham ; that from 
thenceforth all manner of facraments of the church fhall be adminiftred at the 
chapel of Brougham, except burial ; that on Chriftmafs-day in the morning 
fhall be long and mafs at the chapel, then after to go to the church to the high 
mafs and offering ; on eafter-day in the morning at the chapel mattins with 
refurreclion and one foling mafs for fervants and old aged perfons and fick 
perfons, and all the refidue to go to the church to the high mafs (and fo of 
the reft).
That the parfon fhall find two feargies afore St. Wilfrey, on his own 
proper cofts.
For which fervices, Thomas Reding, lord of the manor, gave 
to the chapel at Brougham and parfon of the church and his fuccefTors, one 
tenement as it lies at the weft end of Brougham, with the garths about the 
chapel, within the precincts of the wall and no farther, with the woods and 
waftes and all the commodities within belonging-, with one acre of land arable 
on the fouth fide, as the plough head goes no farther *.
This church and chapel being both much in decay, the countefs of Pem- 
broke, in the years 1658 and 1659, pulled them wholly down and rebuilt the 
fame, more handfomely and ftrongly, all at her own coft.
There was a difpute in bifhop Nicolfon's time, concerning the repair of this 
chapel.
Mr. Bird, the owner of the houfe and demefne adjoining, contended 
that the rector ought to repair the fame -, for that it was buiit (he alledged) at 
the rector's requeft to the bifhop, on conditions to that purpofe.
It is in- 
deed much nearer to the parfonage houfe than the church itfelf is; and whilft 
the town of Brougham had a being, was more convenient for the greateft part 
of the parifh.
But the village being demolifhed, and the lands fvvallowed up 
in that demefne, and none being likely hereafter to dwell at the caftle, the 
owners of that demefne are chiefly accommodated by it.
The lands about it, 
formerly the parfon's, were alio exchanged (for others nearer to the reft of the 
glebe) into the demefne.
So that the owner of the demefne the bifhop thought 
mod juftly liable to the repair (unlefs it fhould be thought fit to let the chapel 
go down).
One Gilbert de Burgham in the time of king John or Henry the third, 
gave half of the village of Brougham, with the advowfcn of the church there, 
to his lord Robert de Veteripont, of whom he held in Drengage, that the other 
half might be free from that fervice.
And the heirs of the faid Robert have 
held the advowfon ever fince.
In the year 13 10, which was the 4 Ed. 2.
one Robert de Appleby was infti- 
tuted to the rectory of Burgham, on the prefentation of Sir Robert de Clif- 
ford knight.
o 
* This account was taken from the papers of Thomas Brougham efquire : Whereof bifliop Ni- 
colfon fomevvhat doubts the authenticity ; perhaps his reafon might be, becaufe there are fome in- 
cumbents of churches mentioned as witneffes, who are not to be found in the bifhops regifters of 
thofe times.
The witneiles are, William Engane and Maid his wife, William Hill his chaplain, 
Thomas Britton parfon of the church of Caldbeck, Thomas Mercer chaplain, John Weiton cha- 
plain, William Hornby, Kenry Skelling de Brougham, Stephen Meyburn chaplain, Thomas Whin-

Richard Tyndall, John Tyndal, Simon Havvell, William Haywell, and others.

In 1355, Sir Thomas, rector of Brougham, was (amongft others) required 
by the bifhop to pronounce the greater excommunication againft certain perfons 
who had broken up a paved way, and committed other outrages in the church- 
yard of Penrith.
â€” And two years afterwards, we find a difpenfation granted 
to Thomas del Clofe (probably the aforefaid Sir Thomas rector of Brougham), 
to be abfent from his living, fo long as he attends on the lord Clifford.
In 1362, on the death of Thomas del Clofe, Thomas de Derby was infti- 
tuted on the prefentation of Roger de Clifford lord of Weftmorland.
In 1 265, on the refignation of Thomas de Derby, John de Merton was in- 
stituted to the faid rectory of Brougham, on the prefentation of the faid Roger 
de Clifford â€” And two years after, on the refignation of the faid John de 
Merton, the aforefaid Thomas de Derby was prefented de novo, and reinftituted.
In 1393, Edward Shelling is faid to have been reclor, when the aforefaid 
compofition was made concerning the chapel.
In the year 1575, one John Wansford, rector of Brougham, was deprived ; 
and was fucceeded by Thomas Burton, on the prefentation of Henry Appleton 
of Rofe gentleman, grantee of that turn from Anne countefs dowager of 
Cumberland.
In 1583, on the refignation of the faid Thomas Burton, inftitution was given 
into the rectory of Brcwgham, alias Ninekyrkes, to Cuthbert Bradley, on the 
prefentation of George earl of Cumberland.
In 1624, on the Death of Cuthbert Bradley, Chriftopher Beecroft was infti- 
tuted, on the prefentation of Francis earl of Cumberland, and Henry lord 
Clifford his fon and heir apparent.
In 1629, William Crackenthorp was instituted en the prefentation of the faid 
Francis earl of Cumberland.
In 1644, Arthur Savage, M.
A. was difpoffeffed of this living, and about 
three years after he got it again, and kept it till the year 1655, but without 
receiving any of the profits all that time, except for one year*.
In 1664, one Anthony Savage refigned the rectory of Brougham, whereupon 
Samuel Grafty, M.

broke, and Montgomery.
In 1680, Rowland Borrow, M.

MANOR OF BROUGHAM.
Having finifhed the matters relating to the church, we proceed next to the 
hiftory of the manor.
In the 22 Hen. 2.
Odardde Burgham was one of tliofe officers (being the third 
in command) who were fined for delivering up Appleby-caftle to the Scots ; 
and was then probably lord of this manor.
For, in the next generation, in the time of king John, or beginning of the 
reign of king Henry the third, we find Gilbert de Burgham (fon of Odard as 
it may feem) who fold the advowfon as aforefaid to Robert de Veteripont his 
iuperior lord.
The next account that we have of it is in the reign of king Edward the 
firft, when it appears to have been divided into three parts ; for in the parti- 
tion of the Veteripont inheritance between the two daughters of the laft Ro- 
bert de Veteripont, Idonea the younger daughter had affigned to her the ho- 
mage and fervice of Chrijliana de Burgham, William de Crackenthorp, and Henry 
Rydin â€¢, which two lad feem to have married two fitters of Chrijliana.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that John Gcdberd, William Crackenthorp, and Henry de Reddings, then held the 
manor of Burgham ; of which manor, the wardmip when it mould happen 
was rated at 3 / 6 s 8d, and the cornage 13 s 6d.
In the 1 1 Ed. 3.
John de Redding and Agnes his wife fuffered a recovery of 
lands in Burgham.
In the 18 Ed. 3.
after the death of Robert de Clifford fon of the aforefaid 
Robert, William de Crackenthorp, John Tyndal, and John Trotter held the manor 
of Burgham.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
by an inquifition after the death of one John Cuthberd 
[perhaps a defcendent of Godberd above mentioned ; for the name, in the 
tranfcript, at luch a diftance of time may eafily be miftaken] it appears, that 
the faid John Cuthberd held of Roger de Clifford lord of Weftmorland, in 
the town of Brougham, the third part of the manorof Brougham and 40 acres 
of land, by cornage, and by the fervice of paying yearly for future of the 
forefters of the faid Roger 2 s in money, and 3 quarters and 3 buffiels of oats, 
and by the fervice of paying yearly to the maintenance of the king's bailiff for 
the time being 10 d: And that John Fernejyde was his heir.
In the 2 Ric. 2.
there is a bounder roll of the manor, which is fet forth as 
having been then agreed upon by the afient of Roger de Clifford and John 
Burgham.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of the faid Roger de Clifford, the inqui- 
fition finds, that John de Tyndal and William de Crackenthorp held two parts of 
the manorof Burgham, by the cornage of \^s 6d.
In the 17 Ric. 2.
the aforefaid compofuion concerning the fervice to be per- 
formed in the chapel is faid to have been made by Thomas Reding lord of the 
manor of Brougham.

In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that 'John de Lancqjlre and Katherine his wife, and John de Crackenthorp, held 
two parts of the manor of Burgham, as in the right of the faid Katherine 
and John de Crackenthorp.
The third part, in the 16 Hen. 6.
was given by 
Johan Tea/dale widow, to Henry Bird, in marriage with her daughter Johan.
In the 3 1 Hen. 6.
John Burgham, John Crackenthorp de Newbiggin, and John 
Byrde held the vill of Burgham.
In the 10 Hen. 7.
by an inquifition on a Quo Warranto it was found, that 
John Burgham died feifed of the manor [i.
e. one third part, as it feemeth] of 
Burgham, and was fucceeded by his fon John Burgham.
By a rental of the eftate of Henry lord Clifford in the 20 Hen. 7.
John 
Crackenthorp paid for fuit of county for Burgham 1 1 s, William Byrde for the 
fame 1 s, and John Burgham for the fame 1 1 s.
By a rental of Henry earl of Cumberland in the 1 8 Hen. 8.
Chrijlopher Burg- 
ham, John Crackenthorp, and William Bird held Brougham, by the cornage of 
1 3 j 6 d.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, Margaret wife of William Crackenthorp, and 
John their fon and heir, Thomas Burgham, and the widow of Henry Byrde, held 
Burgham.
This Thomas had a fon Henry; who (as appears from the parifh regifter) 
bad a fon Thomas ; which Thomas fon of Henry was laft in the male line -of 
that branch at Brougham.
He died in the 5 Ja. 1.
leaving two fillers coheirs j 
of one of whom (Margaret) there is a monument in the church at Kirk Of- 
wald, by which it appears that fhe died two years after her brother.
At this time, one third of the manor remained in the name and family of 
Bird; one other third part had been fold a few years before, namely, in the 
4 Ja. 1.
to Agnes widow of William Fleming of Rydal efquire, which was af- 
terwards purchafed by James Bird; the other third part was fold to William 
Wright a farmer at the caftle houfes, whofe fon Alexander fold the fame to James 
Browne of Martindale one of Oliver Cromwell's captains, who fold to the 
countefs of Pembroke, who in the year 1654 fettled the fame, together with 
the hofpital of St. Nicholas, in truftees, for the maintenance of her hofpital at 
Appleby, and to pay 4/ yearly to the poor of the parifh of Brougham ; re- 
ferving to herfelf and her heirs owners of Appleby caftle, all rights, dues, and 
payments, whether it be netegeld, fofter hens, ferjeant oats, or other due.
And two years after this, the faid countefs caufed a fair ftone pillar to be 
erected by the way-fide nigh Brougham, with this infcription, " This pillar 
*' was erected, A.
D. 1656, by the right honourable Anne countefs dowager 
H of Pembroke, and fole heir of the right honourable George earl of Cum- 
" berland ; for a memorial of her laft parting in this place with her good and 
" pious mother, the right honourable Margaret countefs dowager of Cum- 
" berland, the 2d of April 1616.
In memory whereof, fhe alfo left an an- 
" nuity of 4/, to be diftributed to the poor within this parifh of Brougham, 
** every 2d day of April for ever, upon the ftone here by.
Laus Deo." 
Finally, in the year 1676, by indenture between James Bird of Brougham 
gentleman of the one part, and the honourable John Tufcon of Bolebrooke 
in 
PARISH OF BROUGHAM.
in the county of Suflex efquirc (grandfon of the faid countefs), John Dalftone 
of Milrigge, in the county!
of Cumberland efquire, Thomas Dalftone of Pen- 
rith in the faid county of Cumberland efquire, and Samuel Grafty of Brougham 
aforefaid clerk of the other part, fetting forth, that whereas the faid John 
Tufton had granted to the faid James Bird all that the manor or third part of 
the manor of Brougham, heretofore the lands of William Wright and James 
Browne gentleman, or of one of them, and which the late Anne countefs 
dowager of Pembroke purchafed of him the faid James Browne, and alfo 
divers other cuftomary mefiuages and tenements, parcel of the faid manor or 
third part of the faid manor as aforefaid, with all mines, quarries, rents, fines, 
boons, fervices, and ofther appurtenances (excepted neverthelefs the capital 
mefTuage and demefne lands called Hofpital lands, parcel of the faid manor) ; 
He the faid James Bird grants an annuity or rent charge of 4/, iftuable out of 
certain lands at Yanwith therein mentioned, to be yearly paid on March the 25th 
at the chapel of Brougham, and diftributed by the minifter and churchwar- 
dens of the parifh of Brougham on the 2d day of April yearly amongft the 
poor people of the faid parifh of Brougham, at a certain pillar lately erected 
in a place there called Winter Clofe, by the faid late countefs dowager of 
Pembroke deceafed.
So that now the manor of Brougham, which for about 350 years had been 
held feparate in three divifions, became again united in the name and family of 
Bird.
This family came from Burd Ofwald in Gillefiand, and firft got footing at 
Brougham in the reign of Hen. 6.
as aforefaid, by marriage of the heirefs of 
the owner of one of the three divifions.
There is no certain pedigree of the 
family.
The laft of the name at Brougham was the aforefaid James Bird, 
who was fteward to the earl of Thanet.
He made a confiderable collection of 
matters relating to the tenures of the feveral manors holden under the lords of 
Weftmorland, chiefly from the evidences at Appleby caftle ; of which one copy 
now remaineth at Rydal hall : Other collections he made relating to divers mat- 
ters of antiquity in both the counties of Cumberland and Weftmorland, unto 
which bifhop Nicolfon fometimes refers ; which, it is feared, are now all loft.
â€” â€¢ 
This James Bird had nine fons, who all arrived at man's eftate â€¢> yet he 
died without an heir male.
And the eftate was fold to John Brougham efquire 
of a younger branch of the ancient family of that name in this place, who 
had removed to Scales in Cumberland, and by this purchafe returned to 
Brougham.
We have met with no authentic account of the pedigree of this family of 
Brougham.
There was a pedigree of the Scales branch certified at Sir Wil- 
liam Dugdale's vifitation of Cumberland in 1665 â€¢, but it was refpited for ex- 
hibiting the arms and proofs.
It confuted only of four generations, of Peter, 
Henry, John, and Henry ; and amongft thefe, John, (who is faid to have married 
a Fleming) is evidently miftaken -, for that gentleman's name was Thomas.
According to our account of the manor, as above fet forth, an hiftory, 
though not a regular pedigree, of the family, may be deduced as follows :

Odard de Burgham was an officer at Appleby cattle under Gof- 
patric fon of Orme.
In the next generation Gilbert de Burgham was lord of the manor of Burg- 
ham, and gave one half (as aforefaid) of the village to have the other freed 
from D re n gage.
About the 14 Ed. 1.
Chrifiiana de Burgham held a third part of the faid 
manor.
In the 35 Ed. 3.

In the 5 Eliz.
Henry Brougham was in poflefiion of the family eftate at 
Brougham, and had a fuit in chancery with Thomas Bird concerning fome 
lands called Newlands.
In the 10 Eliz.
he conveyed fome lands to the faid 
Thomas Bird.
In the 27 Eliz.
Thomas Brougham was in poffeflion, having in that year fold 
certain lands at Brougham to Thomas Anfon.
In the 28 Eliz.
he fold fome 
lands to James Bird; and in the 5 Ja. 1.
he died, leaving two fifters coheirs.
Next we come to the pedigree certified to Sir William Dugdale; which, 
with fome necelfary alterations made by Sir Daniel Fleming, is as follows : 
Peter Brougham of Scales (or rather, as it feemeth, of Blackhall ; for the 
eftate at Scales was not in the family till the time of Peter's fon Henry, who 
purchafed it of the Southaiks^ was of a younger branch of the Broughams 
of Brougham, and probably was younger fon of the laft Henry.
Henry Brougham of Blackhall gentleman, fon of Peter.
He married firft a 
daughter of Wharton of Kirkby Thore, and by her had iffue a daughter Jane 
married to Aglionby.
To his fecond wife he married Catherine daughter of 
Fallowfield of Melkanthorp, and by her had ifiue, 
Thomas Brougham of Scales gentleman ; who married Mary daughter of Da- 
niel Fleming of Skirwith efquire, and by her had ifiue Henry, Toby, Tho- 
mas, Chriftopher, William, John, and a daughter Agnes married to Anthony 
Wybergh of Clifton gentleman.
Henry Brougham of Scales gentleman, fon and heir of Thomas, married 
Mary daughter of William Slee of Carlifie merchant â€¢, was of the age of 37 at 
the time of the aforefaid vifitation â€¢, and had ifiue Agnes, Thomas, Henry, 
William, Jane, Barnard, John, Mary, Matthias, Peter, George, and Samuel.
Of thefe, all the fons, except Peter and Samuel, died without ifiue.
John 
the fifth fon, commonly called commiffioner Brougham, purchafed the eftate 
of James Bird's grandchildren, and by his will intailed it upon his four ne- 
phews, according to feniority, and their ifiue male-, viz.
Henry Richmond 
Brougham, and John Brougham, fons of his brother Peter â€¢, and John and 
Henry, fons of his brother Samuel.
Of whom, Henry Richmond Brougham

died in 1749 without ifiiie; his brother John died before him: John fon of

brother, the prefent owner, Henry Brougham efquire.
The arms of Brougham are ; Gules, a cheveron between three luces Argent.

BROUGHAM CASTLE.
The castle of Brougham, feparate from and independent of the manor, 
hath been all along held by the Veteriponts, Cliffords, and their defcendents.
After the death of John de Veteripont, during the minority of his fon, who 
was ward to the prior of Carlifle, we find by an inquifition then taken, that 
the faid prior had fuffered the walls and houfe of Brougham to go to decay 
for want of repairing the gutters and roof-, that a certain bercary (or fbeepfold) 
was fallen down for the length of fivefcore feet, for want of fupport â€¢, that the 
timber was alienated - 3 and one forge reduced to nothing by the neglect of 
repairs.
The firft Roger lord Clifford built the greateft part of this caftle ; over 
the inner door of which he placed the aforefaid infcription, " This made 
Roger." 
By the inquifition after the death of Robert fon of the faid Roger, it was 
found, that he died feifed of the caftle of Brougham, with eightfcore acres of 
arable land, worth yearly \d an acre ; and 40 acres of meadow worth \^d an 
acre: That he had no meffuages there, but only three cotereils (for that he 
was not lord of the vill), each of which cotereils was worth \id yearly: That 
he had there alfo one water mill, worth ^os yearly.
Roger de Clifford, grandfon of the faid Robert, built the greateft part of 
this caftle next unto the eaft, where he caufed his own arms, together with 
thofe of his wife Maud Beauchamp daughter of the earl of Warwick, to be 
cut in ftone.
There is a pond called Maud's Pool, which bears her name to 
this day.
By an inquifition after her death, in the 4 Hen. 4.
the jurors find, 
that the caftle of Brougham and demefne thereto belonging were worth no- 
thing, becaufe they fay it lieth altogether wafte, by reafon of the deft ruction 
of the country made by the Scots ; and that the whole profit of the caftle and 
demefne is not furficient for the reparation and fafe keeping of the faid caftle.
By the inquifition after the death of John de Clifford, in the 10 Hen. 5.
the 
jurors find, that belonging to the faid caftle there is a certain rent of 20 quar- 
ters of oats, and 30 s fterling to be received yearly out of the vills of Cly- 
burne, Wynanderwath, and Brougham : Which rent, as well of oats as of 
money, together with the cuftody of the office of head forefter of Whin- 
fell, are granted to Chriftopher de Morefby for life, the reverfion to Thomas 
fon and heir of the faid John de Clifford and his heirs.
And they fay, that 
to the faid caftle belong 22 quarters of oats to be paid yearly out of the manor 
of Clyfton.

Francis earl of Cumberland entertained king James the firft at this cattle on 
the 6th, 7th, and 8th of Auguft in the year 1617, in his return from his laft 
progrefs into Scotland.
The faid cattle having been again defolated in the civil wars, Anne countefs 
of Pembroke repaired the fame, and caufed the following memorial thereof to 
be cut in ftone in capital letters : " This Brougham cattle was repaired by the 
" ladie Anne Clifford, counteffe dowager of Pembrooke, Dorfett, and Mont- 
" gomery, baroneffe Clifford, Weftmerland, and Vefeie, ladie of the honour

W PI IN FELL PARK.
Together with the cattle, hath been enjoyed the ancient park and chace 
called Whinfell.
In the divifion of the patrimony between the two daughters of the laft Ro- 
bert de Veteripont, the elder daughter's fhare hereof is defcribed to be, half 
of the foreft of Qwynnefel, in herbage, agiftment, wood fold, and all other 
ifiues, worth 23/ 3 s ?,\d per annum â€¢, and the younger daughter's fhare half 
of the foreft of Qwynnefel on the outfide of the park and coney warren lying 
towards Wynanderwath, worth alfo 23/ 3J %~dper annum, 
By the inquifition after the death of Robert de Clifford in the 8 Ed. 2.
the.
jurors find, that he died feifed of one park inclofed, the herbage whereof was 
worth yearly 5/, and the herbage without the park (with the agiftment and 
other profits in the wood of Quinfell) 7/3^4^, turbary 4 s, pleas and per- 
quifites of the court 13 j 4 d.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the jurors find, that 
belonging to the faid cattle there is a wood called the Outewod of Whinfell, 
containing 140 acres of wood worth id an acre per annum y and 40 acres of 
pafture worth 1 d an acre ; which are called Blauncheland, Goryneholme, and 
Barrykholme.
There were here anciently oak trees of prodigious growth, particularly 
three that were called the Three Brothers \ the fkeleton of one of which yet re- 
maineth, about 13 yards in circumference, a confiderable way from the root.
John de Veteripont gave to the priory of Wetheral, for the health of the 
foul of himfelf and of Sibil his wife, 20 cart loads of fire wood yearly out of 
his foreft of Wynfel.
In the time of the firft Robert de Clifford, in the year 1333 or 1334, Ed- 
ward Baliol king of Scotland came into Weftmorland, and ftayed fome time

with the faid Robert at his caftles of Appleby, Brougham, and Pendragon.
And during that time, they ran a ftag by a fingle greyhound out of Whinfell 
park to Red Kirk in Scotland and back again to this place ; where, being both 
fpent, the ftag leaped over the pales, but died on the other fide, and the grey- 
hound attempting to leap, fell, and died on the contrary fide.
In memory of 
this fact the flag's horns were nailed upon a tree juft by, and (the dog being 
named Hercules) this rythme was made upon them : 
Hercules kill'd Hart a-greefe, 
And Hart a'greefe kill'd Hercules.
And the tree to this day bears the name of Hart-horn tree *.
The horns in 
procefs of time were almoft grown over by the growth of the tree, and another 
pair was put up in their place.
A court-leet is held within this foreft, by the flyle of the court of the ma- 
nor of Oglebird - 3 but from what original we have not been able to difcover : 
Nor hath the word occurred in any record or other evidence that hath fallen 
under our notice-, fave only, that one of the inclofures belonging to the eftate 
purchafed by the countefs of Pembroke at Temple Sowerby, is called Oglebird

Within this parifh of Brougham is Hornby, which continued for a con- 
fiderable time in the name of the Birkbecks : having been granted in the 6 Ed. 6.
by Henry earl of Cumberland to Edward Birkbeck.
In the 3 and 4 Ph. and Mary, Edward Birkbeck of Hornby gentleman was 
a truftee of a third pare of the manor of Brampton, for the ufe of the family 
of Backhoufe of Morland.
The pedigree certified at Dugdale's vifitation in 1664, was as follows: 
1. Thomas Birkbeck of Hornby, gentleman, married a daughter of a younger 
branch of the Lancafters of Sockbridge ; and had a fon and heir, 
2. Edward Birkbeck of Hornby efquire ; who married Bridget daughter of 
John Calvert of Cockeram in the county of Lancafter.
[Of this family, and 
probably fon of this Edward, was Simon Birkbeck, an eminent preacher, who 
was educated at Queen's college in Oxford, and was afterwards vicar of Gil- 
ling in Yorkfhire.
He was author of a book, which was much valued by 
Mr. Selden and other learned men, called the Frotejlants Evidence, fhewing 3 
that for 1500 years after Chrift, the fathers and guides of Chrift's church 
taught as the church of England now doth j which was printed at London in 
* So fay the countefs of Pembroke's memoirs, and other hiftorical anecdotes.
But from the 
improbable length of the courfe, we would rather fuppofe, that they ran to Nine Kirks, that is, 
the church of Ninian the Scottish fa nt, and back again ; which from fome parts of the park might 
be far enough for a greyhound to run.
And before this time, there was a place in the park deno- 
minated from the hart's horns ; which feem therefore to have beeu put up on fome former occafion s 
perhaps for their remarkable largenefs.
For one of the bounder marks of the partition aforefaid 
between the two daughters of the hit Robert de Veteripont is called Jierthornftke.

WINDE.RWATH.
On the right hand of the Roman way leading towards Penrith, at the dis- 
tance of about two furlongs, ftands Wjnderwath hall within the precincts 
of this parifh, although the faid hall and the demefne belonging thereto are 
in the parifh of Clibburn.
And this is a cafe which happened fometimes at 
the building of churches, when the lord of the manor or other perfon who 
built the fame had lands lying in another diflrict.
This hall and demefne were 
fold by George earl of Cumberland to Thomas Brathwaite of Warcop efquire; 
one of whofe defcendents fold the fame to Mr. Wyvill, in whofe pofterity it 
itill continues.
The arms of Wyvill are; Gules, 3 Cheveronells braced 
vaire : On a chief Or, a mullet pierced of 5 points Sable.

WOODSIDE.
A little beyond Winderwath hall, on the fame fide of the road, is Wood- 
side, a fmall hamlet belonging to Brougham caflle.
After the death of John 
de Clifford in the 10 Hen. 5.
the jurors find, that the faid John died feifed of 
the village of Woodfide, containing 5 meffuages, worth nothing yearly above 
reprifes ; and 24 acres of arable land, and 9 acres of meadow, worth 6d each.
PARISH OF BARTON.
I. 
^TPHE parifh of Barton, at leaft a great part of it, anciently belonged to 
â– "â–  the barony of Kendal, and was in the hands of the Lancafters barons 
of Kendal ; a branch of which family removed into this parifh, and fettled at 
Sockbridge, and continued there for many generations, until that branch 
ended in daughters; and the pofterity of the eldeft of thofe daughters enjoy 
the manor of Sockbridge, and divers other pofTefTions in the faid parifh to 
this day.
It feemeth therefore neceffary, before we proceed to a particular

Having thus deduced the family of the Lancafters, which had fuch large 
connexions with this parifh, we proceed to.
give an account of the parish 
itfelf.
It 
4 
PARISH OF BARTON.
It is bounded (beginning at the middle of the river Eamont over againft 
the church, and defcending down the river) by the parifhes of Dacre and 
Penrith in the county of Cumberland on the Weft and North, to the place 
where the river Lowther runs in.
Thence, afcending the river Lowther, it 
is bounded on the Eaft by the parifh of Brougham up to Lowther bridge.
Thence bounded further on the Eaft by the parifhes of Clifton, Lowther, 
Afkham, and Bampton.
On the South, and again towards the Weft, by the 
parifhes of Kendal and Grefmere in the barony of Kendale, and by the pa- 
rifhes of Crofthwaite and Greyftock in Cumberland ; and contains in the whole 
about 1 15 families, whereof there are only three or four diflenters.
The church is dedicated to St. Michael ; and is a vicarage, valued in the 
king's books at 1 1 / 1 s o\d ; in the patronage of Sir James Lowther baronet.
It was given by the aforefaid Sir John de Lancaftre fon of Roger to the 
priory of Wartre in Yorkfhire, to which it was afterwards appropriated 5 and 
on the diflblution was granted by the crown to Thomas earl of Rutland, who 
fold the fame to Lancelot Lancafter aforefaid and Michael Hudfon, in whofe 
dependents or aflignees reflectively the fame ftill continues.
In the year 1304 (which was the 33 Ed. 1.) upon the death of William de 
Corbrigge rector of Barton, John the fon of Sir Hugh de Lowther knight (as is 
aforefaid) was prefented to the faid rectory by the aforefaid Sir John de Lan- 
caftre fon of Roger.
And upon zjus patronatus iffued and an inquifition there- 
upon taken, the jurors find, that the faid rectory is worth communibus amis 40/ 
a year, befides the portion which the prior and convent of Wartre have in the 
fame, which is taxed at 12/: And fo they fay, that it is portionary, but not 
penfionary.
They find alfo, that Roger de Lancaftre, father of the faid John, 
prefented to the fame next before.
They find further, that the perfon pre- 
fented is free and legitimate, and that he is 14 years of age and nigh 15, and 
probably is learned as far as his age will permit, and hath the firft tonfure.
At the next ordination, this John de Lowther was ordained Acolite.
Four 
years afterwards, and before he had any other orders conferred upon him, he 
was inftituted notwithftanding his minority, having a difpenfation for the fame 
from pope Clement the fifth.
Seven years after this, being then fubdeacon, 
he was allowed by the bifhop to follow his ftudies abroad for three years.
In the year 13 18, the appropriation of the church of Barton by the faid 
Sir John to the priory of Wartre was confirmed by the bifhop of Carlifle; on 
condition, that the vicar have a full third of the whole revenue and bear all 
ordinary charges, the prior and convent bearing the extraordinary.
And there 
was a refervation to the bifhop of the collation to the vicarage.
But neverthe- 
lefs, two years after this, on the refignation of the faid John de Lowther, the 
bifhop did not collate â€¢, but the prior and convent prefented Gilbert de Sandale, 
and the bifhop inftituted him thereupon, and in the inftrument of inftitution 
calls them the true patrons.
And two years after this, viz.
in 1322, on the refignation of the faid Gilbert 
de Sandale, William de Elvington was inftituted on the prefentation of the faid 
prior and convent.

In 1336, on William de Elvington's resignation, the prior and convent pre- 
fented one of their own canons William de Kyrkton.
In 1345, on his resignation, John de Fenton was prefented and inftituted as 
before.
In 1354, on the resignation of one John de Sherborn, the prior and convent 
prefent Robert de Ferby.
And in the fame year, on his resignation, John de 
Wyftow was inftituted.
In 1 361, William de Newton was prefented and inftituted as before.
About the year 1422, the prior and convent prefented William Spenfer the 
cellerarius of their convent to the vicarage of Barton *.
In 1476, Robert Wrefyl was vicar of Barton.
In 1 541, Lancelot Lancaster of Sockbridge efquire, and Michael Hudfon cf 
Barton gentleman, purchafed (as aforefaid) the rectory of Barton ; and upon 
a vacancy in 1566, there was a difpute between the faid Lancelot and George 
Hudfon fon of the faid Michael concerning the prefentation, by which it may 
feem that at the time of the purchafe it had not been fettled between them 
whether they fhould prefent jointly or by turns, or which of them fhould pre- 
fent firft.
But the biftiop, on this vacancy, collated Sir John Hudfon clerk 
by lapfe, through the default or neglect (as is fet forth) of George Hudfon 
of Barton gentleman, the true patron of the faid church.
In 1 58 1, Adam Abbot was admitted curate of Patrickdale in this parifhj 
on the nomination of the faid Sir John Hudfon the vicar, with the appro- 
bation of Edmund Lancaster efquire and George Hudfon gentleman, propri- 
etors of the rectory, according to a late compromife to that purpofe.
In 1 608, on the death of the faid John Hudfon, Lancelot Dawes, M.
A. 
was inftituted, on the prefentation for this turn of John Fetherfton gentleman ; 
yet at the fame time George Hudfon clerk was prefented by Edmund Lan- 
caster of Sockbridge and Thomas Carleton of Carleton efquires, claimants for 
the fame turn.
He died in 1 653, and was fucceeded by 
Timothy Roberts, a Welchman j who was ejected after the Restoration for 
Nonconformity.
The male line of the Lancafters failing in the next generation, the Lan- 
cafter moiety of the advowfon came to Sir Christopher Lowther as aforefaid, 
on his marriage with one of the daughters; and the houfe of Lowther is now 
in posTesIion of the whole.
In 1660, John- Harrifon was prefented by Sir John Lowther of White- 
haven.
On the death of Mr. Harrifon in 1705, Richard S taint on clerk was instituted 
on the prefentation of the faid Sir John Lowther.
In 1734, on the death of Richard Stainton, Richard Jack/on, M.
A. was 
prefented by Sir James Lowther of Whitehaven baronet.
In 1738, on the death of Richard Jackfon, William Lindfey, M.
A. was 
prefented by the fame patron.

In 1753, Jofeph JVilfon, clerk, was inftituted on a prefentation by the fame

In 1759, on the death of Jofeph Wilfon, John Cowper, M.
A. was infti- 
tuted on a prefentation by Sir James Lowther of Lowther baronet.
The church is a low but large building, having two rows of pillars in the 
body of it.
In the middle, between the body of the church and the chancel, 
is a fair ftone tower, but with low, flat battlements.
Over the porch, on the outfide, cut in ftone, is an efcutcheon with 3 harts 
heads.
In the chancel, above the communion table, are 5 rows of efcutcheons, 7 in 
each row ; many of which are now defaced, and others perhaps only put in 
for ornament or to fill up the number; but amongft them were to be feen in 
Mr. Machel's time the arms of Arundel, of Percy earl of Northumberland 
quartering Lucy, of Dacre, Lowther, Lancafter, Strickland, Threlkeld, Ma- 
chel, Morefby, Orpheur, Crackenthorp.
Upon a brafs plate in the chancel is the following infcription : 
"â–  Hie jacet Francifca Dawes, filia Thomas Flecher de Strickland, armigeri,

Towards the eaftend of the fouth ile, near to the chancel, is a grave ftone 
with a fillet of brafs inferibed, " Here lyeth William Lancafter fon of ChriÂ£ 
*Â« topher: On whofe foul Jefu have mercy." â€” Probably the fame William as 
above at NÂ° 10.
Oppofite to this are painted the arms of Stapleton impaling a defaced coat, 
and the arms of Lancafter.
On the fouth fide is an ile, which has been divided into two ; in the lower 
of which, now belonging to Winder, is a monument inferibed WD, for 
William Davyes, who was buried here in 1674.
On the north fide of the quire and of part of the body of the church is the 
Lancafter ile, formerly the burial place of the Lancafters of Sockbridge.
The vicarage house, about 200 yards from the church, is an handfome 
building, erected in 1637 by Dr. Lancelot Dawes vicar of this parifh, who 
was 
40* 
4e6 PARISH OF BARTON.
was alfo rector of Afby, and prebendary of Carlifle.
He was born in this 
parifh, educated at Queen's college in Oxford where he was fellow, and after- 
wards took the degree of doctor of divinity in one of the Scotch univerfities.
The faid Dr. Dawes purchafed the Hudfon moiety of the rectorial tithes j 
which defcended to his nephew Thomas Dawes â€¢, whofe fon Lancelot fold part 
thereof (viz.
the tithes of High Barton) to his brother John, who fold the 
fame to Edward Haffel efquire.
The other part (viz.
the tithes of Yanwath 
and Bridge, Patterdale, and Martindale) the faid Thomas Dawes fold to Tho- 
mas Whelpdale efquire, who fold the tithes of Patterdale to Mr. George 
Mounfey, and the reft remain to his daughter Elizabeth married to John Ri- 
chardfon efquire during her life, and after her deceafe to her children.
There is zpenjion of 6/ a year paid to the bifhop out of this rectory by the 
impropriators.
The hofpital of St. Leonard York had two carucates of land in Bart nheved 
(the fame probably which is now called High Barton).
Belonging to this parifh is a charity of 200 /, bequeathed by the will of Mrs.
Dudley of Yanewith -, half of the yearly intereft of which (he fettled as an 
augmentation of the vicar's falary, the other half to be diftributed amongft the 
poor.
The school at Barton v/as founded by Gerard Langbaine, D.
D. provoft of 
Queen's college in Oxford, a native of this parifh, and the aforefaid Dr. Lan- 
celot Dawes, in the year 1649.
Dr. Langbaine gave to it 30/.
He alfo purchafed an eftate at Culgaith of 
the then value of 20/ a year ; 10/ whereof were to go to bind out two ap- 
prentices within Barton parifh, the reft to the ufe of the fchool.
Dr. Dawes gave 25 /; and alfo 20 s yearly to the faid fchool, out of the tithes 
of the eftate called Barton-kirk.
Dr. Adam Airey, principal of Edmund Hall in Oxford and native alfo of 
this parifh, gave the intereft of 100/.
And the parifhioners contributed (befides their labour) 46/ 6s $d-, to be ap- 
plied towards building of the fchool, and the intereft of what remained to go 
to the ufe of the fchoolmafter.
And they entered into an agreement in writing amongft themfelves, in or- 
der to prevent confufion, that the feven men named in the faid agreement and 
their heirs fuccefllvely fhouid be governors of the fchool, viz.
Mr. Lancelot 
Dawes, Mr. Francis Siffon, Mr. William Davis, Stephen Mounfey, William 
Smith, Lancelot Smith, and William Langbaine.
Yet in the year 1675 we find thefe governors, Sir John Lowther of Sock-

III.
Concerning the manor of Barton ; we find feveral of old time of the name 
de Barton^ who feem to have been a confiderable family in this parifh, but not 
lords of any of the manors that we can find.
In the 1 5 Ed. 2.
Robert de Barton was one of the jurors upon the inquifition 
on the forfeiture of Roger lord Clifford.
And in the 19 Ed. 2.
Robert de Barton was knight of the fhire for Weft- 
morland.
And there was a family of Bartons at Ormfhead ; whofe arms were, Azure s 
a bend within 3 harts heads Or; which feems to argue that they fprung from 
Hartfop in this parifh.
The lords of this manor of very old time were the Lancaflers barons of 
Kendal ; one branch of which family (as we have fhewed) fettled at Sock- 
bridge.
But the manor of Barton went out of the name of Lancafter, to the 
Multons of Gilfland.
With the heirefs of Gilfland it came to the Dacres.
Thus in the 36 Ed 3.
by an inquifition after the death of Margaret de Dacre 
(who was the faid heirefs) the jurors find, that the faid Margaret held, toge- 
ther with Ralph de Dacre her hufband,.
the manor of Barton.
And fo it defcended, together with the caftle and manor of Dacre, in the 
eldeft hereditary line of the Dacres until the reign of king Charles the fecond, 
when Barbara and Anne daughters and coheirs of Thomas earl of SufTex fold 
the fame to Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave of Edenhall baronet, who again fold the 
fame to Edward HafTel efquire the prefent owner.
In the 17th year of king John, William de Lancaftre, baron of Kendal s 
obtained a grant of a market at Barton Â£.
IT.
A confiderable part cf Ulleswater, from the middle eaftward, is within 
the manor of Barton.
It has its name probably from Ulf a name frequent in 
old time : Lyulf (VUlf) was the firft baron of Grayftock, to whom this lake 
did belong.
It is a large mere of 7 or 8 miles in length, and of a great breadth 
and depth, wherein is great ftore of fifh ; as perch, trouts, grey trouts (fome 
very large, even a yard long, and thick in proportion), pikes, cafe, chars 3 
eels, and fkellies.
Divers perfons have fifheries therein, for which they pay 
yearly a quit-rent.

(Ulleswater.) 
The water which fupplies this lake, at its higheil fource, fprings at Kirk- 
fton-fell in the manor of Hartfop.
Thence it runs, on the eaft fide of Hartfop- 
hall, into a lough about a quarter of a mile over called Broad-water, bearing 
the name of Hartfop beck till it comes there ; and further (after having re- 
ceived Haifwater.) till it be out of Hartfop lordfhip.
Then it receives Deep- 
dale beck, which comes eaftward into it, and fome other rills, and from thence 
carries the name of Deepdale beck till it comes to Goldrel bridge near Pat- 
terdale chapel, where Grifedale beck comes in from the weft, and there it re- 
ceives the name of Eamont.
Thence it runs northward about a quarter of a 
mile into this great lake.
In the courfe of which lake there are three remark- 
able iflands ; i.
Cherry ifland, fo called from a cherry tree anciently growing 
there, diftant from the head of Ullefwater about a mile and a half.
2. Wall- 
holme, over againft Stybarrow ; fo called from its having been anciently walled 
about; diftant from Cherry ifland about two bowlhots.
3. Houfe-holme, 
about a quarter of a mile below ; fo called probably from fome houfe thereon 
formerly.
From hence the water turns in a bow above two miles to a crag 
near How-Down.
Thence directly north- weft to Dun-Mallard, 3 miles in 
length, and in breadth near one mile.
And there the lake ending, the river 
re-affumes its name; and fo running by Sockbridge, Yanwath, Brougham 
caftle, and Hornby, it empties itfelf into the river Eden.
V. 
At the head of the faid water, above Patterdale, lies the manor of Hart-

Hartfop hall, the ancient manor houfe, is a little old building, wherein 
here is nothing very remarkable, lave that in the parlour in the plaifter there 
is an efcutcheon of three harts heads cabofhed, the fame as over the porch at 
Barton church *.
Which are undoubtedly the arms of the family that this 
place belonged to, which probably ended in a daughter married into the Lan- 
caster family ; for thefe arms are quartered with the Lancafters of Sockbridge 
at Sockbridge hall.
Hartfop is of the marquis fee, parcel of the barony of Kendal aforefaid.
Thus amongft the efcheats in the 12 Eliz.
it is found, that the manors of 
Hartfop and Strickland Roger, Ladyford, and certain lands in Skelfmergh, 
were holden of the marquis of Northampton in focage, and by the yearly rent 
of 26 s %d, by Edmund Lancaster.
And in the 15 Ja. after the death of the 
faid Edmund, the inquifition finds, that he died feifed of the premiffes, holden 
as aforefaid, and that Lancelot Lancafter was a fon and heir, being then of 
full age.
There is fine blue flate got here ; which may be tranfmitted into the country 
by boats down Ullefwater.
A mile from Hartfop hall is Aifdale, where is a tarn called Haifwater, which 
affords trouts, fkellies, and eels.

Defcending by the water from Hartfop, we come to Patterdale, fo called 
probably from St. Patrick, to whom the chapel feems to be dedicated.
For 
in the bifhop's regifter it is called Patrickdale, on the admiffion of Adam Abbot 
to be curate as aforefaid.
And nigh unto the chapel is a well called St. Pa- 
trick's well.
This dale is alfo part of the ancient barony of Kendal.
And in the 3 1 Hen. 3.
William de Lancaftre infeoffed the aforefaid Roger de Lancaftre in 200 acres 
of his demefhe land in Patricdale worth yearly 4/, one miln worth 60s, and 
herbage and pannage worth 14.S, and the rent of free tenants to the value of 
28 s lod.
Tie faid Roger had alfo the fervice of Gilbert de Lancaftre, who 
held by knights fervice by the tenth part of one knight's fee â€¢, and the fer- 
vice of Walter de Lancaftre, who held alfo by the tenth part of one knight's 
fee.
The laid William afterwards gave to the faid Roger the whole foreft of 
WeftmorJand â€¢, except Feufdale, and Swartfell, and the head of Martindale, 
which the faid Roger had by a former grant.
The chapel is about ten miles fouth-weft from the parifh church.
It hath 
about ten acres of glebe land worth about 8/ a year; and one third part of 
the tithes of Patterdale, worth about 8/ a year more-, and the intereft of 200/ 
alloted to this chapel by the governors of queen Anne's bounty in the year 
1743, and not yet laid out in a purchafe of lands.
Out of this revenue there 
is a deduction of 4/ a year paid to the vicar of the parifh, who is obliged to 
preach in the chapel four times a year-, and 6s yearly to the recfor of 
Grayftock.
The /^//belongs to Mr. John Mounfrv, whole anceftors purchafej the fame 
of the ThreLeld.
in whom ic had continued for many generations.
This Mr.
Mounfey and his forefathers for time immemorial have been called kings of 
Patterdale, living as it were in another world, and having no one near them 
greater than themfelves.
The hall is an handfom; little houfe, with a court 
and orchard, and terras walk at the door, from whence the afcent to the houfe 
is by feveral fteps.
It fronts to the chapel towards the fouth.
On the weft 
fide of it are vaft rocks and mountains.
North from the hall is a little gill called Glenridden ; from the Scotch word 
glen which fignifie?
a gill or hollow, and Ridden the name of the river which 
runs there with a precipitate courfe into Ullefwater.
Near to Glenridden lieth Glencune, a little farther to the north ; as much as 
to fay, a glen in a corner ; cune, coyn> or corner, being one and the fane 
thins;.
Nigh the chapel, towards the weft, lies a little hollow or gill, which 
they call Grifedale, and the tenants there (who are only about 8 or 10) are 
called in the court rolls as of the foreft of Grifedale.
Grife is a common name 
for fwine, and it may well feem to have taken its name from being frequented 
by wild boars, which are beafts of the foreft.
Unto which, the large rock 
called Styharroiv, on the weft fide of Ullefwater, may have fome allufion.

perhaps there have been deer alfo in this dale â€¢, for there is a place in it called 
Glemara Park.
â€” In the head of the dale, is a rocky mountain called Eagles- 
crag -, and eagles to this day frequent and breed in the mountains thereabouts.
Higher up, about a mile fouth from the chapel, is Deepdale, fo called from 
its fituation ; where there are about ten families, who hold of Grayftock caftle 
in Cumberland.

Martindale is fo denominated probably from another fpecies of beafts of 
venary, namely, the mart em, valuable for its fur.
Man wood, in his Treatife 
on the Foreft Laws, which was hrft publifhed in the reign of queen Elizabeth, 
fpeaking of the martern, fays, of thefe we have no great number in the forefts 
on the fouth fide of Trent, but yet in the county of Weftmorland in Marten- 
dale there are many.
This place is feparated from Patterdale by an high hill 
called Boredale (probably from the like caufe).
In the rental of queen Katharine's eftate in the barony of Kendal in the 
28 Cha. 2.
the tenants in Borebank near Ullefwater ftand charged with a rent 
of 11s iod, as of the marquis fee.
Martindale has a fmall chapel, about 5 miles diftant from the church to- 
wards the fouth- weft.
The ancient endowment whereof is 2/ 15s 4 d yearly 
paid by the inhabitants.
In 1682, Richard Birket, curate there, left by his 
will 100/ to this chapel, in the hands of 4 truftees, and as thefe die away, 
others are to be chofen by the furvivors: 50/ whereof were added to an aug- 
mentation of 200/ by lot given by the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 
and an eftate purchafed therewith in Martindale; and the other 50/ remain in 
the hands of the truftees.
The curate has a little houfe alfo, with about 4 
acres of land.
The whole revenue of the chapel amounts at prefent to ijl a 
year.
Mr. Machel, whofe account was taken about 100 years ago, fays, that the 
curate is always put in by the vicar's appointment, or by his approbation.
But amongft the Efcheats in the 39 Eliz.
it is found, that Anthony Yatts 
yeoman was feifed, in the bailiwick and chapelry of Martindale within the ba- 
rony of Barton, of all the tithes there, together with the title of donation and 
nomination of the ftipendiary prieft in the chapel of Martindale, which he pur- 
chafed of Edward Stanhope efquire in the 35 Eliz.
and which the faid Edward 
Stanhope purchafed of Robert Cheyney gentleman and Winifred his wife and 
others in the 29 Eliz.
And in the 10 Cha. 1.
it was found, that William 
Burner died feifed of two parts in three to be divided of the faid tithes, do- 
nation, and nomination â€¢, and that Anne wife of John Davis was his daughter 
and heir.
The manor, like as of Barton, came from the Multons by marriage to the 
Dacres ; and now by purchafe belongs to the aforefaid Edward Haffel efquire.
Here is a kind of foreft, replenifhed with red and fallow deer â€¢, and there 
ure tenants who are bound to afilft the lord in hunting and turning the red deer 
on the tops of the mountains to the foreft, whom they q&\\ Jlrones 5 and they

There hath anciently been a family de Martindale (and there are many yet 
of the name) : Their arms were j Argent, a bend Azure, 2 bars Gules.
VIII.
Pooley, a village at the foot of Ullefwater, taketh its name undoubtedly 
from that great pool or lake.
It is pleafandy fituate â€¢, having, befides the em- 
bellifhments of wood and water, a great accedlon of beauty from Dun-mallard 
hill (fo called from the refort of wild fowl thither from the lake) on the op- 
pofite fide of the water in the county of Cumberland, belonging to the afore- 
faid Edward Hafiel efquire, who hath a fair eftate near adjoining.
Unto this 
hill Pooley is connected by an handfome ftone bridge lately erected, where an- 
ciently was only a ftank for flopping the water for the fake of filhing, and a 
pafTage on the furface of the flanks 
Here feems to have been formerly a fmall market for fifli.
There is yet a 
fair ftone crofs, with fteps or feats about it, on the top of which are the Dacres 
arms.
This crofs was repaired by the earl of SufTex, as appears by this in- 
fcription on the weathercock, " Thomas earle of SufTex, May 2, 1679." 
The village contains about ten families; molt of whom purchafed their 
tenements to freehold of the earl of SufTex about a century ago.
IX.
The manor of Sockbridge contains in it the hamlets of Sockbridge, fine?, 
and Thorp.
The village of Sockbridge lies weft from the church, and contains about 15 
families.
The tenants purchafed themfelves free of Sir John Lowther of Sock- 
bridge, as did alfo thofe of Tirrel and Thorp.
Here was born the aforefaid Dr. Lancafter, vicar of St. Martin's in the 
Fields, and provoft of Queen's college in Oxford, to which college he was a 
great benefactor.
He was fometime fchool-mafter at Barton, before his ad- 
miffion into the faid college.
Sockbridge hall ftands north from the river Eamont about a bow-fhot, and 
as much eaft from the village of Sockbridge.
It is in a low fituation, there 
being three defcents into the court-yard, before you enter the hall.
It is built 
quadrangular.
And over the hall- door is a flender old tower.
On the ceiling, in plaifter work, in the old dining room, are the aims of 
Lancafter quartering Hartfop ; and impaling Tankard, tffe.

<Tirrel> a little fouth-eaft from Sockbridge, contains about ten families.
And the village of Thorp is a little weft from Sockbridge, and contains 
about 4 or 5 families.
X. 
The hamlet of Winder (fo called perhaps from its height and expofure) is 
part of it in the manor of Sockbridge, and part in Barton.
It is diftinguifhed 
into High and Low Winder (but both of them high enough).
Winder is of the Marquis Fee, parcel of the barony of Kendal.
Amongft 
the Efcheats in the io Ja. it is found by inquifition, that Lancelot Davies died 
feifed of one capital meffuage called Low Winder, and 4 mefiuages and tene- 
ments in Low Winder, and one mefiuage at Borebank, holden of the king as 
of his caftle of Kendal, by knight's fervice.
And the like is found in the 1 3 
Cha. after the death of John Davies.
In like manner amongft the Efcheats in the 10 Cha. William SiflTon is found 
by inquifition to have holden in High Winder one capital meffuage called Sel- 
leron, and 6 other mefiuages and lands, of the king as of his manor of Ken- 
dal called the Marquis Fee; which laid premifles the faid William Siflbn pur- 
chafed of Edward Lancafter and Lancelot Lancafter.

A little below Sockbridge, on the fame fide of the river Eamont, is Yan- 
with or Yanwath (perhaps fo called from fome wath or ford there, by way 
of diftinction from the village called the Bridge a little below).
This is the only manor within this large pariih of Barton, that appears to 
have been held under the Cliffords lords of Weftmorland; and coniequently 
all the reft of the pariih feems to have constituted no part of the barony of 
Weftmorland, but to have been part of the large barony of Kendale, even all 
that which belonged to the Lancafters as aforefaid.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert lord Clifford, Ralph fon of Wil- 
liam baron of Grayftock held the manor of Yanewith.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
John de Grayftock held the manor of Yevenwith by the 
cornage of Ss 6d.
In the 4 Ed. 4.
Ralph baron of Grayftock held the fame.
That is to fay, 
thefe Grayftocks held the fame of the Cliffords, as mefne or intermediate lords ; 
for others at the fame time held the fame of the Grayftocks : one moiety, 
thereof being holden by the Threlkelds, and the other by the Lancafters.
So early as the reign of king Edward the firft, Henry Tbrel eld obtained a 
grant of fiee warren in the manor of Yanwith.
And in the 40 Ed'.
3. William 
.Ihrelkeld paid a relief for a moiety of Eanwath, which he held of the barony

In the reign of king Henry the fixth, the Lancafter moiety came alfo to the 
itbrelkelds.

Grace, one of the laid daughters, was married to Thomas Dudley, of a 
younger branch of a family of Dudleys in the fouth, and with her he had the 
manor of Yanwath.
He had iflue, 
Richard Dudley, who married Dorothy daughter of Edmund Sandford of 
Afkham efquire â€¢, and by her had ifTue.
Edmund Dudley, who married Catherine daughter and coheir of Cuthbert 
Hoton of Hoton John efquire (Sandford of Afkham, and Huddkfton, mar- 
rying the other two coheirs).
He had ifTue, Richard, a prieft : Thomas, who 
fucceeded him : John a lawyer, who married the baftard daughter of Sir 
Chriflopher Pickering, who was afterwards married to Cyprian Hilton of Bur- 
ton efquire: Another fon, called Henry â€¢, and fix daughters.
Thomas Dudley, fon of Edmund, married a daughter of Middleton of Car- 
li fie ; and had iflue, Edmund who died without iflue, Chriflopher, Mary, 
and Catharine.
Chriflopher Dudley, fon of Thomas, married firft Elizabeth daughter of 
bifhop Snowden-, to his fecond wife he married Agnes daughter of Daniel 
Fleming of Skirwith gentleman, by whom he had a daughter Mary who died 
young.
And having no ifTue furviving, he fold the manor of- Yanwath and 
Eamont-bridge to Sir John Lowther baronet about the year 1654, in whofe 
poflerity it ftill continues.
The arms of thefe Dudleys were â€¢, Or, a lion rampant with his tail forked 
Vert, lingued and armed Gules, (With a crefcent.) 
The village of Yanwath contains about 12 families, moflof them cuftomary 
tenants, doing fuit and fcrvice of court at Yanwath hall.
The faid hall ftands at the north end of the village, a little on the weft fide 
of it, on a high bank by the river Eamont.
It is quadrangular; hath an 
agreeable profpect ; and at a diftance hath the appearance of a fmall caftle.
Over the gate there hath been a chapel.
And at the fouth corner there hath 
been an handfome tower, with turrets and battlements.
About a mile fouth from the hall, at the end of Yanwath wood, oppofite to 
Lowther hall, is an ancient round fortification, called Caftle Steads.
Eamont bridge is a fmall village, containing about 12 families, m oft of them

direct line, having only a daughter, named Eleanor Â± who, in the 38 Ed. 3.
was married to William de Wybergh of St. Bees-, and thereby brought the ma- 
nor of Clifton into the name and family of Wybergh.
In the 38 Ed. 3.
on the Monday next after P-dm Sunday, Gilbert fan of 
Gilbert D'engaine of Clifton grants to William Wybergh and Eliancre his wife, 
their heirs and affigns, one yearly rent of 24/ out of his lands at Clifton.
And in the fame year, William Evgayne grants to William de Wybergh one 
moiety of the manor of Clifton, which he had by the grant of Gilbert his bro- 
ther, to hold during the life of the faid Gilbert.
And by another deed in the fame year, Gilbert releafcs and quits claim to 
William de Wybergh, his heirs and afligns, all his right and claim in one moiety 
of the manor of Clifton with the appurtenances, which William his brother had 
by his gift for the term of the life of the faid Gilbert.
He grants alfo to the 
laid William de Wybergh all his bondmen with ail belonging to them (omnes 
bondos et nativos meos et eorum fequelam).
Again, in the 40 Ed. 3.
Gilbert de Engaine gives to William Wybergh and 
Elianore his wife, and the heirs of their bodies lawfully begotten, his whole 
moiety of a moiety of the manor of Clifton, in demefne and in fervices, with 
the fervices of free tenants, and with the bondmen (cum nativis et eorum fcquelis), 
to the faid moiety of the moiety of the faid manor belonging.
[Where we 
may obferve, that the free tenants (liberi tenentes) were not what are now call- 
ed freeholders, as feifed of a freehold eftate, in oppofuion to tenant-right ; but 
only that they were not bondmen or villeins of the lord holding in drengage.] 
The arms of the Engaines were; Gules, a bend wavy, with fix crofles fitchet, 
Or, three above and three below.
At theeaft end of the chancel are three little windows.
In the middle win- 
dow is a crucifix.
In one of the other is the portrait of a woman in a port u re 
of devotion, and underneath are the faid arms, and writ above Helynor Ingayne.
In the third window, in Mr. Machel's time, was a man leaning his cheek on 
his right hand, and holding a book in his left ; and above, the arms of Fal- 
lowfield of Great Strickland.
In the 4 Ric. 2.
the faid Elianor, being then a widow, made a fettlement of 
the eftate ; for in that year there is a deed, wherein John de Dufton chaplain 
grants to Elianore who had been the wife of William de Wybergh and to Thomas 
de Lowther of Afcome, their heirs and affigns, his manor of Clifton, with the 
cents and fervices, milns, meadows, woods, and ether appurtenances, which 
he had by the gift of the faid Elianore.

In the 14 Ric. 2.
William Engain (uncle of the faid Elianore) grants to Wil- 
liam Ferrour of Clifton and his heirs, all his lands and tenements, wood, pal", 
ture, and the like, at Clifton.
And in the fame year, Thomas de Lowther of 
Afcome (aforefaid) releafes the fame to Ferrour.
Which faid William Ferrour 
was fecond hufband of the faid Elianor.
For in the next year, by the inqui- 
fition pcji mortem of Roger de Clifford, it is found, that William Ferrour and 
Elianor his wife, as of the right of the faid Elianor^ held of the faid RoÂ»er, 
on the day on which he died, the manor of Clifton.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that William Wybergh (probably fon of Elianor by her former hufband) then 
held the manor of Clifton : And finds alfo, that the faid John de Clifford 
held at Clifton, in his demefne as of fee, one meffuage and 16 acres of land, 
worth yearly 12 s.
In the 3 1 Hen. 6.
Thomas Wybergh held Clifton of Thomas de Clifford as of 
his barony of Weftmorland, by homage and fealty, and 16s ^d cornage, and 
other fervices and rents reckoned amongft the fervices of thecaftle or Burgham.
In the the 17 Ed. 4.
Thomas Wybergh on his fon William's marriage with Mar- 
garet daughter of John Wharton of Kirkby Thore efquire, fettles on the 
iffue of the faid marriage, a tenement in Clifton then in poffeffion of Thomas 
Raper, one acre of land in Clifton called drengage acre, and one parcel of de- 
mefne land there.
This Thomas Wybergh died in the 19 Hen. 7.
leaving his 
fon and heir William then 30 years of age.
In the 5 Hen. 8.
a contract was entred into between the faid William and 
Geoffrey Lancafter of Melkanthorp gentleman, that Thomas fon and heir of 
'John Wybergh fon and heir of the faid William mould marry Elizabeth daughter 
of the faid Geoffrey.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
Thomas Wybergh efquire held of Henry earl of Cumberland 
the manor of Clifton by the cornage as before, owing alfo wardfhip, marriage* 
relief, and fuit to the county court; owing alfo further by the cuftom of the 
C2ftle of Burgham twenty-two quarters and an half of oats iffuing out of the 
manor aforefaid, which cuftom is called Dringage, and was rented at divers 
times as the fame could be fold.
In the 28 Hen. 8.
an award was made by Henry earl of Cumberland, be- 
tween Sir John Lowther knight and Thomas Wybergh gentleman, concerning 
certain lands which the faid Thomas Wybergh had inclofed â€¢, by which it was- 
awarded, that the faid Thomas fhould hold the fame inclofed as before.
In the 4 b'd.
6. Thomas Wybergh efquire exchanged fome lands at Clifton with 
the faid Henry earl of Cumberland.
in the 5 Eli?., on a difpute concerning the boundary of the manor of Low- 
ther, an indenture of agreement was made between Richard Lowther of Low- 
ther efquire and Thomas Wybergh of Clifton efquire, fetting forth the bounder 
marks particularly : And they further covenanted, that each of them in their 
own respective lordfhips will permit and fuffer fo much of the moor as laid un-

tttre, for the beafts and cattle of the inhabitants of both the towns and lord- 
fhips as well of Clifton as of Lowther from thenceforth for evermore, without 
let, interruption, or difturbance of either party.
This family fuffered much in the civil wars in the reign of king Charles the 
firft.
The manor was mortgaged to Sir John Lowther, and never afterwards 
redeemed.
But the hall and demefne ftiil remain to the Wyberghs.
In the year 165?, Thomas Wybergh efquire of St. Bees was in the lift of de- 
linquents (as they were called) whofe eftates were ordered to be fold by an or- 
dinance of Cromwell's parliament in that year.
This Thomas was fucceeded by his fon Thomas Wybergh efquire, who died in 
the year 1670.
He alfo was fucceeded by his fon Thomas.
Who alfo had a fon Thomas.
Who had another Thomas; who married Mary daughter and heir of Chrif- 
topher Hilton of Burton efquire, and by her had 22 children.
He died in 
1753, and was fucceeded by his eldeft furviving fon, 
William Wybergh efquire 5 who dying in 1757, was fucceeded by his fon 
and her, 
Thomas Wybergh of Clifton efquire now furviving.
The arms of Wybergh are â€¢, Sable, three bars Or, with three mullets of the 
fecond, two in chief and one in bafs.
The hall or manor houfe ftands on the other fide of the highway oppofite to 
the church.
It appears to have been a ftrong, old building, turreted â€¢, in a 
pleafant fituation, with fair fields on every fide.
It feems to have been built 
by the Engaines, there being (in Mr. Machel's time) on the latches of fome 
of the doors the arms of Engaine, and the fame were formerly carved in wood 
over the dining room chimney, but now removed.
The village of Clifton contains about 25 families j befides which there are 
about 7 ftraggling houfes at Clifton Dikes.
Anciently, amongft other fervices, they paid a boon fervice, which was, to 
go to St. Bees with man and horfe, to fetch fait from thence, or other necef- 
iaries, once in every year.
For which, moft of them would compound with 
the bailirF for half a crown, when he went to warn then, which was fometimes 
in the depth of winter.
But fome would rather chufe to go, and then they 
had 1 2 d a piece of the lord, and bread and cheefe and ale when they returned.
The lalt that went was Henry Penrith *, who brought fait from St. Bees to 
Lowther, at the fummons of Sir John Lowther, unto whom the manor was 
mortgaged.
The manor having come to the faid Sir John by virtue of the faid mortgage, 
the tenants paid a fine to him on the death of the mortgagor ; and Thomas fon 
of the faid mortgagor dying, Sir John demanded another fine upon his death ; 
which the tenants contending, the matter was compromifed, and the tenants

mould be inclofcd, the tenants to have two thirds of the fame (paying 2 d an

Clifton moor is memorable in hiflory, on account of a fkirmifh between Wil- 
liam duke of Cumberland and the rebels in the year 1745; wherein about 15

Honywood of Howgill caftle was taken up for dead, having received feveral 
dangerous wounds in his head after his fcull-cap was beaten off, his hat having

Dr. Todd makes mention of a fountain near the bank of the river Lowther

PARISH OF ASKHAM.
A Skham feems to have been fo called from fome proprietor thereof in an- 
"*"*â€¢ cient time of the name of /IJke; for fuch a name there was.
So late as 
the reign of king Henry the eighth, Sir Robert AJke of Yorkfhire is recorded 
in hiftory for heading an infurre&ion ; and that fame Sir Robert feems to have 
had fome connexions in Weftmorland, for he had a daughter married to Sir 
Robert Bcllingham of Burnefhead.
'Tis true, this place of ancient time was 
mod commonly, and in the molt authentic inftruments, written Afcum or Af- 
ccm.
But this was only by way of accommodation to the latin idiom, re- 
jecting the letter k -, for they feem to have underftood juft fo much of pure 
latin, as to know that it did not admit the letters k and w.
Afcom is the borne 
or habitation of AJke. The Saxon is ham; which, fuffixed to the name of a 
place, feems generally to denote one of the more confiderable towns or vil- 
lages, of which hamlet is a diminutive.
â€” AJkeby (now Afiy) in the fame county 
feems to be of the like derivation.
Other s derive the name of this place from 
the Saxon Efc, which fignifies an hazel nut ; with which fruit this place even 
to this day remarkably abounds.
And the word Afcum, in the old law latin, 
fignifies a boat-, fo denominated from its refembling a nut fhell.
The parifh of Afkham is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Lowther 
and Bampton, on the South by the parifh of Bampton, on the Weft by the 
parifh of Barton, and on the North by the parifhes of Barton and Lowther ; 
and confifts of about 8 1 families, all of the church of England, except only 
one or two.
The church is dedicated to St. Peter, perhaps in allufion to the rock on which 
it is founded.

This church was granted to the monaftery of Wartre in Yorkfhire, and the 
appropriation thereof to the faid monaftery was confirmed by pope Innocent 
the fourth in the year 1245.
The canons of Wartre had alfo half a carucate 
of land at Afkham *.
After the dififolution, the fame was granted to Thomas 
earl of Rutland â€¢, who fold the rectory and advowfon to Lancelot Lancafter and 
Michael Hudfon â€¢, and they, for the fum of 256/ 2 s 3d, in the 34 Hen. 8.
conveyed the fame to Thomas Sandford efquire of Afkham ; whofe defcendent 
William Sandford efquire fold the rectory to Sir John Lowther of Lowther in 
the year 1680, butreferved the advowfon of the vicarage.
In the year 1295, which was the 24 Ed. 1.
one Richard de Settrington, canon 
of Wartre, was vicar of Afcom : On whofe refignation William de Maltcn, 
another canon of the fame houfe, was prefented by the prior and convent-, to 
whom inftitution was given, on condition that (according to the order of the 
faid prior) he mould have always refident with him another brother of the fame 
order.
For where the revenues would bear it, it feemeth to have been not un- 
ufual to quarter upon the incumbent one other or more of the convent.
Thus 
at Morland we find three rectors at one time.
In 1346, upon the death of John Claworth vicar of Afcom, Robert de Dale, 
a canon of Wartre, was prefented by the faid prior and convent.
In 1359, the faid Robert refigns ; and John de Wyntringham, another canon 
of the fame houfe, was prefented by the faid prior and convent.
In the year 1366, which was the 40 Ed. 3.
one Robert de Ferriby appears 
to have been vicar of Afkham.
And in 1375, Henry de Holme.
In 1380, John de Merton, canon of Wartre, was prefented by the prior and 
convent.
In 1437, John Danby was vican 
In 1448, Robert Wrefyl ; who was afterwards vicar of Barton.
In 1563, on the death of Thomas Watter, inftitution was given to John 
Airay, on the prefentation of Thomas Sandford efquire.
In 1573, John Airay died.
In whofe time Thomas Sandford efquire granted.
the prefentation on the two next avoidances to John Middleton of Farlam in 
the county of Cumberland gentleman, in consideration of the good counfel 
and advice given to him the faid Thomas Sandford in his caufes.
And Mr.
Middleton prefented John Simp/on, who received inftitution thereupon.
This 
John Simpfon died in the year 1604-, ar >d upon this vacancy, there is a cafe 
ftated, and the opinion of Sir Edward Coke thereupon.
The cafe ftates the 
death of Middleton before the avoidance, and that he had by his will given 
the next turn back again to the heirs of Thomas Sandford â€¢, that the heirs had 
refufed the bequeft; and one of the queftions is, whether the executors of 
Middleton fhould prefent, or it would fall to the bifhop.

This Lancelot was ejected during the ufurpation of Oliver Crom-

In 1678, Jofepb James, mailer of arts of one of the univerfkies of Scotbnd,

OF THE MANOR OF ASKHAM.
The firft account that we meet with of this manor is in the reign of king 
Henry the third, when S\r Thomas de Helbeck (lord of the manor of Helbeck) 
received the fame in exchange for divers lands holden by knight's fervice*.
He had a fon Thomas de Helbeck, who alio had a fon Thomas de Helbeck, who 
in the 3 Ed. 2.
appears by inquifition to have held the manors both of Helbeck 
and Aicom.
But foon after, we find this manor gone out of the name of Helbeck ; for 
in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Robert de Swineburne then held the manor of Afcom, by homage and fealty, 
and 50 s gd cornage.
And the wardfhip thereof, when it fhould happen, was 
eftimated at 20/.
In the 46 Ed. 3.
Robert de Swynburn conveyed the fame to William de Sand- 
ford fenior clerk, William de Sandford junior clerk, Thomas Bannay, and 
Edmund de Sandford ; who all joined in a conveyance in the 48 Ed. 3.
to 
William Colynfon ; which William Colynfon reconveyed the fame in the 49 
Ed. 3.
to the faid Edmund de Sandford in fee.
Which Edmund was founder of 
the family of the Sandfords both at Afkham and Howgill.
He was younger 
brother of William de Sandford, lord of the manor of Sandford in the parifh of 
Warcop, defcended of a family of the fame name, who had been lords of the 
manor there, for feveral generations, atleaft from the reign of king Richard 
the iirfb.
And with this Edmund we begin our pedigree of the Sandfords of 
Afkham.
1. The faid Edmund de Sandford married Idonea, daughter and heir of Sir 
Thomas Englijh (UEngleys) lord of Little Afby, of an ancient family there : 
by which he came not only to the manor of Little Afby, but alfo to a moiety 
of the manor of Helton, and a large eftate in land at Afkham, which fhe in- 
herited from her father: All which was previous to the purchafe made by her 
hufband of the manor of Afkham.
He had by his faid wife five children, viz.
William, Robert, John, a daughter 
Joan married to Robert Brette efquire, and another daughter Idonea who feems 
to have died unm^rritd.
He died in the 50 Ed. 3.
His wife furvived him, and married to her fecond 
hufband Sir Thomas Uarhtred knight, and to him had iflue William and Mar- 
garet.
She furvived her fecond hufband alio-, for in the io Hen. 4.
there is a 
bond from Idonea Vghireih, late wife of Thomas Ughtreth knight, to William- 
Sandford knighc her fon for performance of covenants.
In s<he 2 Hen. 5.
there is a will of the faid Idonea, in which fhe conftitutes 
two executors, viz.
Robert Brette efquire, who married her daughter Johan â€¢, 
and her ion John Sandford, brother of the faid William : And therein fhe charges 
* Machel, from the B'enkinfop evidences at Hslbexk,.

her fon Sir William Sandj 'or d, and that he fhall charge his fons, and fons fons 
after him, to provide a fit prieft to celebrate divine fervice in the church of 
Afcome for ever, for the fouls of their benefactors and of all faithful people 
departed this life-, on pain of her blefling or malediction.
It is dated at Cra- 
nefle in the county of Northampton (probably where her fecond hufband had 
.refided).
And there is alfo a fchedule of her eftate in Weftmorland, as followeth : 
" I dame Edone Sandforth" [by which it appears, after the death of Ugh- 
treth, that fhe occafionally re-aflumed the name of Sandforth) " makyth my

" dayes : and for thefe londes of Afcome the chyld iuld be ward gyff the law 
" will, and for noe nother londes that myne is." In this fchedule, the ma- 
nor of Little Afby is not mentioned : And for that, (being held by knight's 
fervice) an infant heir would have been fuhject to wardship.
Probably, it 
was fettled upon the marriage of her fon William.
It is certain it was then 
in the family, and after feveral generations was given to a younger brother 
who removed to Howgill, in whole posterity it ftill continues.
She was living five years after this-, for in the 7 Hen. 5.
fhe made another 
will (her fon William being then dead), wherein fhe bequeathed " her body 
" to be buried in the church of St. Peter in Leycefter, and to the faid church 
" her principal legacy, being her beft veftment, by name a mantle : To Ido- 
" nea Sandford fne bequeathed her beft black bed with the appurtenances : 
" To the mother of Robert Brette, all her gowns and curtles : To Johan her 
*' daughter one vefTel of filver, without a cover : To the laid Idonea all her 
" chefts and jewels : And to Robert Sandford her heir thofe 8 oxgangs of 
'* land, and half of the mill in Afcome, which her father bought of Sir Hugh 
" de Lowther-, upon condition that he find one chaplain to celebrate mafs

" finding a chaplain and making distribution as aforefaid." Which chapel 
then flood nigh unto the hall, diftinct from other buildings.
Before we take our leave of Edone Sandford, it occurs to obferve a fort of 
pride frequently in the heirefs of an ancient family, in recounting the titles 
and eftates of her ancellors.
She confiders herlelf as pofTeffed of all the blood 
of all her progenitors.
And this excites a laudable effort to perpetuate the 
name, by works of magnificence or of charity.
Dame Helene Engaync at Clif- 
ton had her portrait and name depicled in one of the church windows, in 
token (no doubt) of her having been a benefaclrefs there.
And in an higher 
fphere, the lady Anne countefs dowager of Pembroke will be memorable at 
Appleby for generations to come.
The arms of ' Englijh were â€¢> Sable, 3 lions rampant, caud indexed, Argent.
2. Sir William de Sandford of Afkham knight, fon of Edmund and Idonea* 
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that William de Sandford then held the manor of Afkham.
]n the 9 Hen. 4.
William de Hoton in Forefta and William de Bolton quit 
claim to Sir William de Sandford knight, of all their right which they had in 
the manor of Afkham, with the mill there, and other lands elfewhere.
This Sir William died before his mother, about the 5 Hen. 5.
for in that 
year there is a receipt for rent given by her to his executors William de Hoton 
in Forefta de lnglewod, Hugh de Salkeld de Rofgill, John de Lancaftre de 
Brampton, and William de Wybergh.
He died without iflue, and was fucceeded by his brother, 
3. Robert de Sandford.
That this Robert was younger brother of William, 
we find, for that at Little Afby about that time, one Thomas Dalamore held 
the manor of Little Afby in right of his wife, late wife of William Sandford 
elder brother of Robert Sandford efquire; and that fhe had the fame in jointure 
with her faid late hufband, the reverfion thereof belonging to the faid Robert.
This Robert fucceeded his brother about the 5 Hen. 5.
as aforefaid, and his 
mother Idonea 2 or 4 years after.

OF THE MANOR OF HELTON FLECKET.
This place hath received this defcriptive denomination, to diftinguifli it 
from another Helton in this county which was called Helton Bacon from a fa- 
mily of the name of Bacon, owners thereof.
Probably this Helton alfo might 
be denominated from the owner; but this hath been more early than we have 
any notice.
Anciently it was written Fleckan, Flechen, fometimes Fleckam.
In the partition of the Veteripont inheritance between the two daughters of 
the laft Robert, in the 14 Ed. i.
the homage and fervices of Robert de Mor- 
vill, for the manor of Helton Flechan, were afllgned to the younger daughter 
Idonea.
Which Robert de Morvill died in the 18 Ed. r.
and this manor was divided 
between his two daughters and coheirs Margaret married to Wejjington^ and 
Idonea married to Engli/h.
The Wejjington moiety proceeds as follows: In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death 
of Robert de Clifford, the inquifuion finds, that Walter de Wejjington held the 
fame; the wardfhip whereof was worth 61 i$s \d, the cornage 16 s 4^.
In 
the 31 Ed. 3.
William de Wejjington and Alice his wife levied a fine of a moiety 
of the manor of Helton Flechan, to the ufe of William Wejjington (probably 
their fon).
Sir Daniel Fleming fays, it belonged afterwards to Mallory and 
Norton ', and finally came by purchafe to the houfe of Lowther.
The account which occurs to us of the Englijh moiety is thus : Idonea the 
younger daughter of Robert de Morvill, being married to Robert Englijh lord 
of Little Afby, had a fon William, who had a fon John, who had a fon Ro- 
bert, who had a fon Thomas, which Thomas in the 13 Ed. 3.
obtained a grant 
of free warren at Helton Flecham, with licence to impark the wood of 
Satron.
The faid Thomas had an only daughter and heir Idonea married to Edmund 
de Sandjord as aforelaid ; in whole name and family this moiety continued, till 
the laft of the name at Afkham, William Sandford efquire, fold the fame to 
Sir John Lowther in 1680.

PARISH OF LOWTHER, 
Owther undoubtedly hath its name from the river.
The word is Britifh, 
" L/ and fignifies clear water.
So Lauder^ a river in Scotland, gives name to 
Lauderdale.
The river Lowther fprings in Wet Sleddale in the parifh of Shap, and runs 
along by Shap abbey, Rofgill hall, through the parifh of Bampton, by Afk~ 
ham and Lowther halls, Clifton hall, Round table, and at Brougham caftle 
falls into Eamont, where it lofeth its name, and is carried along with the river 
Eamont into Eden.
The parifh of Lowther is bounded on the eaft by the parifh of Morland ; 
on the fouth by the parifhes of Shap, Bampton, and Afkham ; on the weft, 
by the parifhes of Afkham and Barton ; and on the north, by the parifh of 
Clifton ; and contains about 72 families, all of whom (except only one dif- 
fenter) are of the church of England.
It is a rectory, valued in the king's books at 25/ ys 3-^; and is in the pa- 
tronage of Sir James Lowther baronet.
Before we proceed to the feveral particulars relating to this parifh, it is ne- 
ceffary to give fome account of the family which derived their name from 
hence.
I. 
FAMILY OF LOWTHER.
I. The firft of the name of Lowther that we have met with, appear in a 
grant of lands at Kirkby Thore, by Liulf fon of Liulf of Kirkby Thore to 
the abbey of Holm Cultram, in the reign of king Henry the fecond.
To 
which grant, amongft other perfons of confiderable note, are witneffes Wil- 
liam de Lowther, and Thomas de Lowthere.
And to a grant by W.
Breton of a carucate of land at Colby to the abbot 
Clement and the fraternity of the abbey of St. Mary's York, the Witneffes 
are, Robert archdeacon of Carlifle, Murdac dean (rural) of Appleby, Wil- 
liam de Lowther^ Adam de Mufgrave, Gofpatric fon of Orme, Torphin de 
Wateby, Thomas de Hellebeck, Gamel de Sandford, Adam fon of Uchtred 
de Botehon, Alan fon of Torfin, Waldeve de Kirkby Thore, William de Ap- 
pilby, and Copfi Maureward.
(The faid Clement was made abbot in the 
32 Hen. 2.) 
II.
To a deed of Lands at Slegill, without date*, amongft others, are wit- 
neffes Sir Thomas de Lowther and Alan de Berwys ; which Alan appears to 
have lived in the reign of king Henry the third.
So that it is not improbable, 
that this Sir Thomas was the Thomas above mentioned, and fon of the faid V/il- 
tiam.
And about the fame time, Thomas de Lowther was witnefs to the foun- 
dation 
PARISH OF LOWTHER.
dation charter of a chantry in the chapel at Great Strickland hall : And to an 
agreement between the prior of Wetheral and Alexander de Windfor concern- 
ing Morland wood *.
III.
The next that we meet with, was SirGERVASE de Lowther knight, 
who lived in the reign of the fame king Henry the third f .
About the fame 
time, Gervafe de Lowther archdeacon of Carlille often occurs.
IV.
Next we come to a pedigree certified at an herald's vifitation of York- 
fhire in 1585, and at a vifitation of Weftmorland in 1627 %â€¢ Both which pe- 
digrees begin with Sir Hugh de Lowther knight, who was attorney general 
in the 20 Ed. r.
and knight of the fhire in the 28 Ed. 1.
and again in the 
parliament holden at Northampton in the 33 Ed. 1.
He married a daughter of Sir Peter de Tilliol of the county of Cumber- 
land knight; and by her had iflue, 1.
Hugh, his fon and heir.
2. Thomas, who 
was one of the jurors on the inquifition poji mortem of Alexander king of Scot- 
land in the 21 Ed. 1.
who found, that he died feifed of the manors of Pen- 
rith, Soureby, Languetheby, Salkild, Carlatton, and Scotby â€¢, which he held 
of the.
king of England in capite, rendring for the fame yearly one foar hawk 
at the caflle of Carlifle, and doing to the king of England for the fame ho- 
mage and fealty : And that John de Balliol was his next heir, of the age of 
thirty years.
The faid Sir Hugh was afterwards juftice itinerant and efcheator on the north 
fide of Trent, and in the 5 Ed. 3.
was made one of the juftices of the court 
of king's bench.
429 
o 
V. Sir Hugh de Lowther, fon of the laft Sir Hugh, according to both 
the aforefaid pedigrees, married a daughter of Lucy lord of Cockermouth.
In a pedigree of this family at Rydall hall, it is faid that he married Margaret 
daughter and heir of William de Quale.
Perhaps both may be right ; as one 
of thefe two might be his fecond wife.
It is certain, the Lowthers, next af- 
ter their paternal coat, quarter the arms of Whale ; viz.
Ermin, a canton 
Azure, charged with a crofs upon 3 flares Argent.
This Sir Hugh de Lowther, taking part with Thomas earl of Lancafter and 
other nobles, who refented the haughtinefs and pride of Piers de Gavefton earl 
of Cornwall, the great favourite of Edward the fecond, had the king's pardon 
with the faid earl of Lancafter and others of great quality, for taking arms, 
and being concerned in the death of the faid Piers de Gavefton, or any others 
whatfoever, according to a fpecial provifion in the parliament held at Wefl- 
minfter in the 7 Ed. 2.
whereby it was enacted, that none mould be called to 
account for the death of the faid Piers de Gavefton.
In the 17 Ed. 2.
he was one of the knights of the fhire for Cumberland ; 
and the year following this Hugh de Louthre and Richard de Denton were 
commiflioned to array and have ready all men at arms in the county of Cum-

men at arms in the county of Weftmorland, and to be in readinefs to atcend 
the king, who determined at Eafter to go in perfon againft the French, who 
-had taken feveral towns in his duchy of Guyenne.
In the 13 Ed. 3.
he was again commiffioned to array all men at arms in the 
counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland, the king then going beyond the 
feas.
In the 14 Ed. 3.
he ferved for the county of Weftmorland, in the parlia- 
ment held at Weftminfter.
In the 15 Ed. 3.
he was again returned one of the knights for the county 
of Cumberland, to the parliament held at Woodftock, and with Peter deTyl- 
iiol the other knight had a writ for 19/ 12 s to be levied on the county for 
their expences in attending 49 days.
In the 17 Ed. 3.
he ferved for the fame county, wirh John de Orreton â€¢, and 
in the year following was elected with Henry de Malton.

And 
in the 33d, and again in the 46 Ed. 3.
he was returned one of the knights for 
the county of Weftmorland *.
VI.
The next in the aforefaid pedigrees is Sir Robert de Lowther 
knight ; who married Margaret daughter and heir of William Strickland bifhop 
of Carlifle.
At the fame time was John de Lowther (younger brother, as it feemeth, of 
the faid Robert), who in the 50 Ed. 3.
was returned one of the knights for the 
county of Weftmorland, and in the indenture is ftyled John fon of Hugh de 
Louthre.
He was alfo returned for the fame county with James de Pickering 
to the parliament held at Gloucefter in the 2 Ric. 2.
and the year following

with Sir 
Thomas Colville and Sir John Etton knights, William Selveyn, Henry Van- 
Croypole, and Simon Ward, obtained the king's licence to challenge certain 
perfons of the kingdom of Scotland, to exercife feats of arms.

Sir John Lowther of Lowther baronet, grandfon and heir of the 
laft Sir John, was born at Hackthorp hall, and educated at Appleby fchool 
(to which he was a confiderable benefactor) and afterwards at Queen's college 
m Oxford.
He married Catharine daughter of Sir Henry Frederic Thynne, fifter of 
Thomas vifcount Weymouth.
He was chofen one of the knights for Weftmorland in the parliament that 
met at Weftminfter on the 8th of*March 1678, which being diffolved in July, 
and a new one called to meet on the 17th day of Oflober following, he was 
again elected for the faid county.
Which parliament, after feveral prorogations, 
did not fit to do bufinefs till the 21ft of October 1680, when falling on the 
popifh plot, and bringing in a bill for difabling James duke of York from 
inheriting the crown, it was diffolved on the 1 8th of January the fame year.
The diffolution of thefe two laft parliaments put the nation into fome 
ferment, and obliged his majefty to call another to meet at Oxford the 
21ft of March in the fame year: but this change of place very much di'f- 
pleafed the major part of both houfes, who apprehended fome arbitrary de- 
figns in it ; and Sir John Lowther, with moft of the old members, being 
chofen, proceeded with the fame zeal upon the bill of exclufion : whereupon 
they were diffolved feven days after their meeting.
This was the laft parlia- 
ment called by king Charles.
And in that called by king James, Sir John 
Lowther was again elected ; as he was alfo in the convention parliament that 
fettled the crown on the prince and princefs of Orange, and in all other parlia- 
ments whilft he was a commoner.
He had die courage to concert with his 
friends, the revolution brought about by king William â€¢, and on his landing in 
the weft, fecured the city of Carlifle, and procured the counties of Weftmor- 
land and Cumberland to appear in his intereft.
For all which fervices, on king William's acceffion, he was conftituted vice- 
chamberlain of his majefty's houfhold, and fworn of his privy council, five 
days after their majefties were proclaimed.
Alfo on the king's appointing the

MANOR AND ADVOWSON.
The manor and advowson feem never to have been ir>tirely feparated, and 
therefore our account of them jointly will be moft intelligible, as they will 
mutually tend to illuftrate each other.
. 
So early as the reign of king Henry the fecond, the manor feems to have 
been divided into three parts ; and confequently the appendent advowfon.
For Humphrey Machel, in that king's reign, granted to the priory of Carlifle a.
third part of the church of Lowther-, which grant the faid king confirmed : 
Upon .which account the rector of Lowther paid yearly to the faid priory 
zbs 8d, which penfion is now paid to the dean and chapter.
In the year 1649,, 
it was given in upon oath to Cromwell's commifiloners, that the dean and 
chapter of Carlifle had right to a third part of the pofleflions of the church 
of Lowther, and likewife of prefenting to it every third turn.
Hereupon a 
controverfy arofe (as had done before in 1609 with Sir Chriftopher Lowther) 
between that collegiate body and Sir John Lowther.
But on inquifition and

examination 
PARISH OF LOWTHER.
examination of witneffes it appeared, that whatever right of prefentation the 
dean and chapter might have had originally, they never had fo much as once 
prefented to the rectory.
A caveat had been entred of the like nature by 
queen Elizabeth in 1579, claiming right to a third prefentation inverted in the 
late diflblved monaftery of Watton, but it had no effect.
*. 
In the 6 Ed. 4.
one of the three parts feems to have been divided into two 
by means of two coheirs, one married to Robert de Morvil, and the other to 
Gilbert de Whiteby : the two remaining parts belonging to the priory of Wat- 
ion t and William de Stirkland, For in that year, in an affize, an agreement was 
made between the prior of Watton, Robert de Morvil and Alice his wife, Gilbert 
de Whiteby and Henry fon and heir of Chriftian wife of the faid Gilbert^ and 
William de Stirkland, concerning the advowfon of the church of Lowthre.
Accordingly, in the 3 Ed. 2.
we find the manor in four bands ; for in rhat 
year, the heir of John de Ccupland, Henry de Haverington, Simon de Ahe, and 
the prior of Watton held Lowther under the Cliffords.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
the family of Lowther appear to have one fourth part, pro- 
bably by purchafe from the faid Simon de Alve ; for by an inquifition in that 
year, after the death of Robert lord Clifford, it appears, that Adam de Coup- 
land, Henry de Haverington, Hugh de Lowthre, and the prior of Watton then 
held Lowthre ; of each of whom (except the prior) the wardftiip was worth 
40 .r, and the cornage of the whole 20 s \d.
Not Jong after we find the advowfon in two hands, and fo the lame teems 
to have continued till after the difiblution of the monafteries.
In the 14 Ed. 2.
the bifhop in his ordinary vifitation finding William de Capella, rector of Low- 
ther, fo aged and extravagant, that he was unfit for the difcharge of his cure 
and management of his ecclefialtical revenues, afiigned William de Kendale clerk 
to be his guardian and afliftant.
And two years after, upon the death of the 
faid William de Capella, an agreement was made between Walter de Styrkland and 
the prior of Watton, by which the prefent vacancy was given to the faid prior, 
and thereafter to the faid Walter and his heirs alternately with the prior and his 
fucceffors.
In the 7 Ed. 3.
there was an exchange of lands between Sir Walter de Stirk- 
land and Sir Hugh de Louth er \ whereby Sir Walter conveyed alfo to Sir Hugh 
his moiety of the advowfon of the church of Lowther.
But that feems to 
have been only for the next avoidance ; for the Stricklands continued in pof- 
ieffion of that moiety long after.
In the 36 Ed. 3.
on die death of Sir Thomas de Hurworth rector of Lonthre, 
Sir Thomas de Stirkland knight prefented Mr. Walter de Wells prieft, who was 
inftituted thereupon.
In the 40 Ed. 3.
Sir Thomas de Stirkland conveyed his lands of Levenes, 
Hellyngton, and other places, with the advowfon of the church of Lowther, 
to truftees (by way of fettlement).
In the 3 Ric. 2.
Sir "John Bone was rector of Lowther; having in that year 
from tiie bifhop a difpenfation of ab fence.
â€¢ Todd, 
In 
PARISH OF LOWTHER.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John lord Clifford, Sir Robert Lowlher 
knight appears by inquifition to have then held the whole manor of Lowther, 
paying cornage 20s 4 d.
In the 4 Hen. 6.
Sir Robert de Louther knight, in purfuance of a grant to 
him made by Sir Thomas de Stirkland knight, prefented John de Raiy chaplain 
to the rectory of Lowther, who was thereupon inftituted.
In a rental of the Clifford eftate in the 31 Hen. 6.
it is exprefied, that John 
de Coupland, Adam de Haverington, Simon de Alve, and the prior of Wat- 
ton heretofore held Lowther -William and Lowther-John, by homage and fealty 
and 20s 4 d cornage; and that Hugh de Lowther now holds the fame by the fame 
fervice.
â€” Which diftinction of Lowther -Willi am and Lowther-John is alfo ob- 
ferved in a rental of Henry earl of Cumberland in the 18 Hen. 8.
In the 5 Ed. 4.
the next avoidance of the rectory of Lowther was granted 
by the prior and convent of Watton to John Wherton efquire and others.
Where- 
upon the faid John prefented one John Wherton clerk, who was thereupon in- 
ftituted, in the place (as it feemeth) of one Thomas Cleveland deceafed ; for 
in the fame year the will of Thomas Cleveland, late rector of Lowther, was 
proved by the commiflioners of the archbifhop of York, during the vacancy 
of the bifhoprick.
In the next account which we have met with of the advowfon, the Strickland 
moiety appears to be in the family of Lowther; the fame having been pur- 
chafed, together with the manor of Hackthorp, by Richard Lowther efquire.
And in the 22 Eliz.
a caveat being entred againft the ad million of any clerk 
prefented on the next vacancy on the behalf of queen Elizabeth claiming right 
of a third prefentation lately inverted in the difiblved monaftery of Watton-, a 
like caveat was entred by Chrijlopher Loivther gentleman, fon of Richard.
And 
foon after, on the death of Mr. Anthony Garnet, inftitution was given to Tho- 
mas Fairfax, S.
T. B.
on the prefentation of the faid Richard Lowther.
And in the 29 Eliz.
on the refignation of Mr. Fair/ax, Leonard Lowther^ 
M. A.
was inftituted on the prefentation of the faid Richard Lowther.
In the 7 Ja. 1.
on the death of Mr. Leonard Hudf on alias Lowther, the dean 
and chapter of Carlifle claimed (by caveat) the patronage ; but inftitution was 
given to Chrijlopher Lowther, B.
A. on the prefentation of Sir Chrifiopher Low- 
ther knight.
In the i4Cha. 1.
it was found by inquifition, that two parts of the manor 
of Lowther were holden of Francis earl of Cumberland by the fervice called 
Noltgeldy paying yearly to the faid earl 20*4^; and by the fervice called 
Serjeant food, paying 10 s yearly: And that the third part was holden of Ro- 
bert Strickland efquire, paying yearly one hawk or 6 d *.
In the 16 Cha. 1.
John Teafdale was rector of Lowther â€¢, he being in thai 
year a contributor to the building of the fchool there.
In 1676, on the death of William Smith rector of Lowther, Richard Threl- 
keld, B.
A. was inftituted on the prefentation of Sir John Lowther baronet.
In 1 694, Richard Holme ', M.

In 1763, on the death of Hugh Robinfon, Henry Lowther, M.
A. was in- 
stituted on a prefentation by Sir James Lcwther baronet.
In 1769, on the resignation of Henry Lowther, William Lowther* B.
A. 
was instituted on a prefentation by the fame patron.
The village of Lowther heretofore was considerable, confiding of the hall, 
the church, the parfonage houfe, and 17 tenements, melTuages;, and cottages, 
all which meffuages and tenements were purchafed by Sir John Lowther in 
the year 1682, and pulled down and demolifhed to iniarge his demefne, and 
open the profpecT.
to his houfe, for they Stood juft in the front of it *.
After 
he had removed the village, he likewife (with confent of the bifhop and in- 
cumbent) pulled down the parfonage houfe, which was a very mean one, and 
built a better, with out-houfes fuitable, in a more convenient place ; and ex- 
changed the lands and other revenues belonging to the church, greatly to the 
advantage of the incumbent.
He alfo, in 1685, pulled down and rebuilt a 
great part of the hall, and much improved that which was left {landing.
Laflly, in the year 1686, he pulled down all or mod of the church, and re- 
built it in a much better form, with a cupola in the middle, and furniflied 
the fame very elegantly, and inriched it with noble communion plate.
The 
hall was unfortunately burned down about the year 1720, little remaining 
thereof except the bare walls, and two large wings that elcaped the flames.
The prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet is preparing to rebuild the hall 
in a ftill more magnificent and commodious manner.
The reverend Thomas Robinfon, rector of Oufby, in his Efiay towards a 
natural hiftory of Weflmorland and Cumberland, printed in the year 1709, 
fpeaking of Lowther hall, fays, " It is not only by the elevation of the ground 
freed from thofe fogs and waterifh froSts, which in the fpring mornings draw 
down to the rivers, and fo corrupt the air as to harbour flies and other 
noifome infects, or elfe by the intenfity of the cold kill the fruit in the 
blofibm ; but is alfo fo much below and at fuch a distance from the moun-

clivities of the mountains, are either fpent or Strike a level before they reach

Yet this fituation hath fo much advantage from the mountain winds,

ruption.
It is not only fenced from violent winds by all kinds of forell 
trees of nature's own production, but adorned and beautified by fuch fo- 
reign trees and winter greens as are raifed by human art.
It hath by nature 
fuch a gradual afcent to the houfe, as makes the avenue to it molt noble 
and magnificent.
Its fituation is upon a limeftone rock, which doth not 
only fecure the foundation, but fo fertilizes the earth and foil, as to make 
it proper for gardens, orchards, terras- walks, and other molt delightful 
conveniences.

* s The elevation of its fituation gives it a molt curious landfkip of woods 
â€¢* waters, mountains, rocks, towns, churches, and caftles, which entertain the 
" eye with a delightful profpect.

4*i 
There is a fmall school at Lowther which was endowed by Sir John Lowther 
and his uncle Richard, whofe donations are regiftred at large in the parifh re- 
gister book in the year 1638.
And a fchool-houfe was built by them and the 
aforefaid John Teafdale the rector in 1640.
There was another fchool of a more ample foundation fet on foot by John 
vifcount Lonfdale, for the benefit of all the northern counties.
But being 
only in its probationary ftate, it was thought fit by the late lord Lonfdale to be 
difcontinued.
III.
MANOR OF WHALE.
Whale is a fmall village in the parifh of Lowther, about a mile fouth from 
the church, confiding of about 8 or 10 families, with two or three ftraggling 
houfes on Whale moor.
It was anciently held by a family of the name de Whale.
In the 7 Ed. 1.
John de IVhale was a juror on the inquifition poft mortem of Peter de Brus.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
it was found by inquifition, that Richard le Fraunces held of 
Robert de Clifford, on the day on which he died, Meburn Maud and Quale; 
the wardlhip for both being 40 j yearly, and the cornage 33 s.
And in the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, Richard Vernon 
held Meburn and Whale, by the like cornage of 33 s.
Finally â€¢, this, like as many others, was drawn within the vortex of the houfe 
of Lowther, from age to age purchafing, and never felling again.
IV.
MANOR OF HACKTHORP.
About a mile and an half fouth-eaft from the church, is the village of 
Hackthorp, containing 13 or 14 tenements.
The hall is at the fouth end.
Over the court door are the Lowther arms, unto which family it now belongs.
It was never held of the Cliffords â€¢, but was anciently part of the patrimony 
of the barons of Kendal.
In the reign of king Henry the third, Ralph de Aincourt releafed to Wil- 
liam de Lancaftre and his heirs his right in 50 s of land, in which he was bound 
unto him by the charter of William de Lancaftre his grandfather, for the quit- 
Vol. I.

claim which the faid William made to the faid Ralph of the fervice of Garr.el 
de Hakethorpe.
The faid William releafed to Ralph de Aincourtand his heirs 
the fervice or the faid Gamel in Drengage and other fervices *.
In the 35 Ed. 3.
Sir Thomas de Stirkland (who held under the barons of 
Kendal) had a licence from the crown to impark his woods at Hackthorp and 
other places, for his good fervices in the parts of France.
It was purchafed of the Stricklands by the Lowther family as aforefaid : 
And in the i4.Cha. 1.
it was found by inquifition, that the Manor of Hack- 
thorp and advowfon of the church of Lowther were holdcn of the king as of 
his manor of Kirkby in Kendale, called the Marquis Fee, by knights fervice j 
and were worth by the year five marks -f.
V. 
MANOR OF MELKANTHORP.
About two miles eallward from the church is the village of Melkanthorp, 
which anciently feems to have belonged to a family of that name.
In the 8 Ed. 1.
Galfridus de Melcanthorp was conftable of Roger lord Clif- 
ford of his caftle of Appleby.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
by an inquifition of tenants in Weftmorland who held by 
cornage, it was found, that Margaret de Ros then held Melkanthorp, paying 
5* cornage.
Whether fhe was a daughter of the Melkanthorps, or fhe was 
the Margaret de Rofs who then held Kendal caftle, hath not appeared to us.
The latter is more probable â€¢, for Melkanthorp was not holden of the Cliffords 
lords of Weftmorland, but was parcel of the manor of Kendal called Mar- 
quis Fee.
Melkanthorp afterwards came to the Mufgraves â€¢, then to the Fallowfields ; 
and by marriage of the heirefs of Fallowfield to the Dalftons of Acorn Bank â€¢, 
who fold the fame to Sir John Lowther.
The arms in Melkanthorp hall (which is the manor houfe of Great Strick- 
land) are, Mufgrave, quartering Ward and Stapleton.

I. PARISH OF MORLAND.
The parifli of Morland (Moor-land) is bounded on the Eaft by the pariflies 
of Kirkby Thore and St. Michael's Appleby, being feparated from them by 
the River Eden -, on the South-eaft by the parifh of St. Laurence Appleby ; on 
the South, by the parifh of Crofby Ravenfworth ; on the South-well, by the 
parifh of Shap-, on the Weft and North- weft, by the parifhes of Bampton and 
Lowther-, and on the North, by the parifh of Cliburn : And contains about 
271 families; all of the church of England, 7 only excepted.
The church of Morland (according to Dr. Todd) is dedicated to St. Lau- 
rence.
It is a vicarage, in the patronage of the dean and chapter of Carlifle, va- 
lued in the king's books in the 26 Hen. 8.
at 11/ 18 j x\d.

â€” Other lands at Mor- 
land were given to the faid abbot and convent of St. Mary's York and to the 
prior and monks of Wederhale, by Henry Legate and Peter his brother -h.
The cell of Wetheral feems about that time to have been overftocked.
For 
in the time of bifhop Bernard (who was intermediate between the faidbifhops 
Athelwold and Hugh) we find three incumbents at Morland all at one time; 
for, to the confirmation by the faid bifhop Bernard of the grants by Thomas 
fon of Gofpatric to Shap abbey (about the year 1170), amongft other wit- 
neiTes, there are Gilbert, Walter, and Thomas, rectors of the church of Mor- 
land.
And about the year 1230, Richard de Agneta was vicar of Morland, and at 
the fame time there was one Thomas parfon of Morland.
In 1234, Michael, vicar of Morland, was witnefs to a compofition about 
Morland wood *.
In the year 1313, king Edward the fecond prefented Sir John de Wanvyke,

then vacant.
In 1316, on the death of the faid Sir John, the abbot and convent prefent 
Mr. Henry de Rillingtcn ; who is inftituted, with a refervation of 4 marks yearly 
penfion to the laid patrons.
In 1332, one Sir Henry, vicar of Morland, being accufed and cited for 
keeping (contrary to the conftitutions of Otho and Othobon) a concubine 
named Emma Hall [Emma de Aula], had his abfolution and difmiffion.
In 1334, Sir Henry de Appleby vicar of Morland, and Sir Richard de Ha- 
verington vicar of the prebendal and collegiate church of Derlington in the 
diocefe of Durham, with the confent of their refpective patrons and ordinaries, 
exchange their livings ; whereupon Sir Richard de Haverington is inftituted 
to Morland.
In 1362, on the death of Sir Richard de Haverington, the abbot and con- 
vent prefent Sir John Murrays, prieft, who is inftituted.
In the next year after, he exchanges with Sir William de Layfingby, for the 
rectory of Welbery in the diocefe of York.
In 1368, Sir William de Layfingby makes a new exchange with Sir John 
Bray vicar of Helmefley in the diocefe of York; to which the abbot and con- 
vent, patrons of Morland, give their confent.
This fame Sir John, by the 
name of John del Bray (John of the brae), appears to have been vicar in 1 383.
In the year 1424, there was a difpute between Sir John Richemont vicar of 
Morland and the prior of Wetheral, concerning the oblations in St. Mary's 
chapel of Wythe within the parifh of Morland, and half an acre of land lying 
upon Litel Ayncfl/ergh, and abutting on the common of Banc, within the ter- 
ritory of the vill aforefaid ; which was referred to the arbitration of the abbot 
of St. Mary's York.
Who awarded the fame to the prior-, unlefs it fhould

MANOR OF MORLAND.
The manor of Morland was never held of the Veteriponts or Cliffords ; 
but belonged to the barons of Kendal.
Ketel fon of Eldred fon of Ivo afore- 
faid was both lord of the manor and patron of the advowfon.
William de Lancajlre, the firft of that name, grandfon of the faid Ketel, 
granted the manors of Heverfham, Grayrigg, and Morland, in frank mar- 
riage with his daughter Agnes, to Alexander de Windefore fon and heir of Wil- 
liam de Windefore.
In the time of which Alexander, a partition was made of the 
wood at Morland, between him and the prior of Wetheral *.
The faid Alexander Windefore had a fon William de Windefore ; who had a fon 
Alexander de Windefore, who in the n Ed. 2.
levied a fine of the manors of 
Grayrigg and Morland.
This laft Alexander had a fon William, who in the 
25 Ed. 3.
is found by inquifition to have held the manor of Morhnd of 
"William de Coucy, by cornage, wardfhip, and relief.
In the 36 Ed. 3.
he 
had a grant of a market and fair at Morland (which, if ever fet on foot, have 
been long fince loft by difufe).
In the 49 Ed. 3.
by the inquifition after the 
death of Joan de Coupland, it appears that he then held the manors of Ha-

This faid laft William de Windefore had a daughter and heir Margery, who 
was married to John Ducket efquire, which firfb brought the family of Bucket 
into Weftmorland, who fettled at Grayrigg, and continued there for 12 gene- 
rations.
The manor of Morland doth not appear to have come to the Buckets.
And whether indeed the Windfors had the whole manor of Morland is uncer- 
tain.
Probably they had not.
It feemeth that Ketel aforefaid, together with 
the church and lands there, gave part of the manor to the aforefaid abbey.
For the monks of Wetherall, and fince the diffolution the dean and chapter 
of Carlifle, have enjoyed the greateft part of the faid manor â€¢, and the af- 
fignees perhaps of the Windfors the other part.
Accordingly, there feem to have 
been two manor houfes, one called Low Hall, which belonged formerly to the 
Mufgraves, who are faid to have had one third part of the lordfhip, and the dean 
and chapter the other two thirds * ; the other called Broad/old, holden of the 
dean and chapter by the family of Backhoufe, which continued at Morland for 
feveral generations.
By a rental of the poffcfllons of the cell of Wedyrhall, when Richard Efyng-- 
walde was prior there in the 6 Hen. 7.
1490, there appear to have been 21 te- 
nants to the faid priory at Morland, paying in the whole the yearly rent of 
ill \cs io^d; befides 90 acres of demefne.
In the 9 Eliz.
there is a licence to Robert Bowes and Eleanor his wife, to 
alienate Morland to Simon Mujgrave.
And in the 13 Eliz.
John Southaic gentleman appears to have been feifed of 
a moiety (as it is there called) of the manor of Morland, with 100 acres of 
wood, which he purchafed of Simon Mujgrave and Julian his wife.
And by inquifition in the 34.
Eliz.
it appears, that Lancelot Backhoufe gentle- 
man (fon of Henry, fon of Robert) died feifed of a moiety of the manor of 
Morland, and alfo of the wood and underwood commonly called Morland 
wood, containing by eflimation 50 acres-, which he held by feoffment from 
John Southaic efquire: And alio one pafture called Woodhoufe Clofe; one 
parcel of meadow adjoining to the faid clofe â€¢, one acre of arable and meadow 
called Stanelands : Of all which he died feifed in the manor of Morland.
And.
alfo of one third part of the manor of Brampton ; and of one third of one mef- 
fuage and one cottage in Dufton ; both of which, at Brampton and Dufton, 
he had by deed indented of Briget Backhoufe widow his grandmother, dated 
Feb. 2.

gentleman, and John Backhoufe clerk, to the ufe of the faid Briget for life,, 
remainder to Henry Backhoufe and his heirs male, remainder to Gilbert and 
his heirs male, remainder to Anthony and his heirs male, remainder to the right, 
heirs of the faid Briget for ever.
The jurors further fay, that the faid Lan- 
celot held the faid moiety, of the queen in capite, by the fervice of the 20th 
part of one knight's fee ; that it is worth yearly 22 s.
And that the faid third 
part of the manor of Brampton, and other the premifles at Dufton, he held:

And that Robert 
Backhoufe was his brother and heir, then aged 21 years.
This family of Backhoufe, like many others, ended in a daughter ; mar- 
ried to Ifaac Eels efquire.

GREAT AND LITTLE STRICKLAND.
Strickland (Stirkland) gave name to the family of Strickland, which con- 
tinued here for many generations, and afterwards removed to Sizergh.
They 
held likewife of the barons of Kendal, and not of the barons of Weftmor- 
land.
About the time of the reign of king Henry the fixth, a family of the name 
of Fallowfield fucceeded at Strickland, whether by purchafe from the Strick- 
lands, or how otherwife, we have not found.
The firft of the name of Fallowfield, that hath occurred in Weftmorland, 
was Nicholas de Fallowfield, who in the 10 Hen. 5.
was one of the jurors on 
the inquifition poft mortem of John de Clifford.
In the 34 Hen. 6.
Thomas Fallowfield efquire was a juror on the inquifition 
poft mortem of Thomas de Clifford.
And to bring the name home to Great Strickland, in the firft year of queen 
Mary, we find a bond of indemnity to one of the Wyberghs of Clifton, ex- 
ecuted by Thomas Fallowfield of Great Strickland efquire, and Edward Fallow* 
field gentleman his fon and heir.
In which year alfo Thomas Fallowfield repre- 
fented the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
In the reign of king James the firft; Richard Fallowfield of Strickland hall, 
efquire, married Hellen daughter of Sir Chriftopher Lowther of Lowther 
knight: Who had a daughter and heir Lucy Fallowfield, married to John Daljlon 
of Acorn Bank efquire ; who brought with her a large acceffion of fortune to 
that family.
The faid John Daljlon had a fon Chriftopher, who fold the eftate 
to Sir John Lowther, in whofe pofterity it ftill continues.
The arms of Fallowfield were ; Sable, three efcalops Or *.
At Little Strickland, there was a family of Cracken thorps for feveral 
generations.
They defcended, by a younger branch, from the Crackenthorps 
of Newbiggin.
The common anceftor was Chriftopher Crackenthorp of New- 
biggin efquire, who in the time of king Henry the eighth married a Blenk- 
inlbp of Helbeck ; and by her had iffue Henry, who fucceeded to the inhe- 
ritance at Newbiggin ; and a younger fon John, who fettled at Little Strick- 
land.

D. the famous lo- 
gician, who was chaplain in ordinary to king James the firft, a profound di- 
vine, a fubtle canonift, and replete with all the learning of thole times.
Chriftopher, fon and heir of John, married Barbara Ward of Yorkfhire ; and 
by her had iflue Richard, Thomas, and Frances.
Richard, fon and heir of Chriftopher, married Elizabeth Fairer of Warcop

Richard, fon and heir of Chriftopher, married Elizabeth daughter of John 
Wilfon of Spittle.
He fold the eftate at Little Strickland to Mr. John Pat- 
tinfon of Thrimby : And had iflue, befides feveral other children, the.
reve- 
rend Gilbert Crackenthorp, now living (1775), the late worthy fchoolmafter of 
the free grammar fchool of Kirkby in Kendale.
In the reign of king Charles the fecond, Thomas Fletcher efquire, bar- 
rifter at law, refided and had a good eftate at Little Strickland.
He was re- 
corder of Appleby in 1692.
He was anceftor by a daughter and coheir to 
Sir Fletcher Norton knight the prefent fpeaker of the honourable houfe of 
commons.
In the reign of king Henry the third, Sir Walter de Stirkland knight had 
a licence from Hugh bifhop of Carlifle, to keep a domeftic chaplain in his 
family within the parifh of Morland.
IV.
THRIMBY.
Thrimby is a fmall village in this parifh, confiding only of about fix fa- 
milies.
Mod of the lands were bought up by John vifcount Lonfdale.
It feems to have belonged anciently to a family who received their name from 
thence.
In the 4th year of king John, there was an agreement between the 
prior of Watton and William de Tyrneby, concerning a carucate of land, to- 
gether with pafture for 1000 fheep at Tyrneby*.

And a difpute 2rifing between the priory of Watton and the rectors of the 
church of Morland, concerning the tithes of their lands within the faid parim, 
as well of the lands which they had in their own hands, as of thole which 
were let to farm ; the fame was referred to commiflioners appointed by autho- 
rity of the pope : who awarded, that the prior and convent of Watton mould 
pay to the re&ors of Morland forever, the tithe of the corn of all their lands 
in the parifh of Morland let or to be let to farm ; except one carucate of land 
which they held in demefne, for the tithes whereof they fhouid pay to the 
church of Morland for ever and the rectors there, one mark of filver yearly -j-.
In the 13 Joh. one of the witneffes to a charter of Shap abbey is William 
de c tbirneby.
In the next reign, John fon of William de Thirneby gave to the priory of We- 
derhale certain lands at Thirneby, with a grange thereupon.
Afterwards, Thrimby appears to have belonged to the Harringtons.
Thus

John de Haverington held of the king 
in capite the manor of Thirneby, as of the fee of Coucy (afterwards called the 
Richmond fee) J.
In the rental of queen Katharine's lands in the 28 Cha. 2.
Sir John Lowther 
ftands charged with a yearly rent of 1 3 j ^d for lands in Thrimby, parcel of 
the faid Richmond fee.
The tithes of Thrimby, which heretofore belonged to the priory of Wetheral, 
belong to the dean and chapter.
A leafe of which tithes was given as a le- 
gacy to the vicars of Dacre in fucceflion.
Which tithes being diminifhed 
greatly by the purchafed lands being laid into Lowther park, and the leafe being 
fuffered to expire, the faid John vifcount Lonfdale gave to the dean and chapter 
200/ for the fame, whereby they obtained the further fum of 200/ from the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty, wherewith an eitate was purchafed for the 
ufe of the vicars of Dacre.
The chapel of Thrimby was quite deferted and fallen to decay, until the fame 
was reftored by the above mentioned Thomas Fletcher efquire â€¢, who by deed

To avoid the inconvenience of teaching in the chapel, a new fchoolhoufe

V. NEWBY.
There are many places of the name of Newby (which means no more than 
New town) ; and theiefore this, by way of diftin&ion, and from the nature of 
its fituation, is called Newby Stones.
This manor alfo appears to have had no connection with the barony of 
Weftmorland under the Cliffords.
There were anciently many of the name 
de Newly, who feem to have been lords of this manor.
In the 10 Hen. 8.
one Richard Vernon of Nether Haddon in the county of 
Derby held of the king in capite 16 mefluages and 300 acres of land in 
Newby.
He was fucceeded by his fon George Vernon efquire ; of whom, Richard Nt' 
vittfon of Kemplees yeoman rented a me'Juage at Newby in the Stones., together 
with a wood called Newby wood, and a parcel of ground called Forty penny

â€” 
The faid Richard died in the 13 Cha. 1.
and by inquifition it was found, that

being within age.
4. Edward Nevinfon of Newby efquire, fon and heir of Richard, married 
Sufanna daughter of Sir Chriftopher Dalfton of Acorn Bank knight.
Which 
Edward was of the age of 40 years at Dugdale's vifitation aforefaid.
This family claimed to be defcended from a family of that name of con- 
fiderable account in the South.
And a refpite was entred by Sir William 
Dugdale, for further proof of the connexion between the two families, but 
no further proof was made.

SLEGILL.
Slecill, Sleagill, probably hath its name from Jloe trees (vulgarly pro- 
nounced Jlea trees) having grown there.
This feems to have been efteemed 
anciently part of Newby ; for in the time of Edward the fecond, we find a 
leafe from John Prodhom and Joan his wife of lands at Slegill in the hamlet of 
Newby.
And Slegill, as the other manors before mentioned within this parifh, 
was not held of the Cliffords, but was part of the barony of Kendal.
This manor, in the reign of king Henry the third, and for fome time after, 
appears in the hands of divers perfons who received their name from the place.
There was one Gilbert de Schleagyle, who gave a mefTuage with the appurte- 
nances to the priory of Wetheral.
And Thomas de Morland appears to have 
held lands at Slegill of Gilbert de Slegill.
After him, Robert de Slegill was witnefs to a grant of lands at Meburn Re- 
gis by John fon of Walter de Ravenfby to the priory of Wetherall.
By a deed without date, Adam de Slegill, fon of Robert de Slegill grants to 
John de Staffole and Alice his wife and their heirs, his manor of Slegill, with 
the appurtenances ; together with the fervice of one barbed arrow by Robert 
le Spencer for his lands in Slegill, and with the fervice of one race of ginger 
by William Prodhom.
The Slegill arms were, a greyhound catching an hare.
Amongft: the Efcheats in the 13 Cha. 1.
it is found by inquifition, that 
William Fayrer died feifed of 12 meffuages and tenements in Slegill, in the 
tenure of divers cuflomary tenants there, holden of the king as of his manor 
of Kendal called the Marquis Fee, by knights fervice.
The Blenkinfops of Helbeck had confiderable poffeMions here ; as alfo had 
the abbot and convent of Sbap.
In the 30 Hen. 8.
there is a grant by Richard Evenwode abbot of Shap 
and the convent there, to Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquire, his heirs 
and affigns, of a watercourfe running acrofs a clofe of theirs at Slegill called 
Milneflatte, to the water mill of the faid Thomas, as Ihall be mod conve- 
vient ; rendring to them for the fame two pence of filver yearly at the feaft 
of Pentecoft, if demanded.
In the year 1670, William Mawfon gentleman, with confent of the dean 
and chapter, gave a leafe of the tithes of Slegill to the vicarage of Penrith.

KING'S MEABURN.
King's Meaburn, as then belonging to the crown, was fo called by way 
of diftinclion from Maud's Meaburn, which belonged to Maud wife of the firft 
Robert de Veteripont, fifter of Sir Hugh de Morville ; the one was Meaburn 
Regis, the other Meaburn Matild*.
This 
454- PARISH OF MORLAND.
(King's Mealurk.) 
This manor, together with the reft of the barony of Weftmorland, was 
granted by king John to the faid Robert de Veteriponr, in whofe pcfterity it 
itill continues.
In the partition of the eftate between the two daughters of the laft Robert dc 
Veteripont, Ilabella de Clifford had three fourths of this manor, and her filter 
Idonea de Lay bourn the other fourth ; the whole together valued at $ol 6s %d.
Jn the 1 8 or 19 Ed. 1.
John Crombwell and Idonea his wife, widow of Roger 
de Laybourn, granted to Stephen fon of William de Meburne and his heirs, 
fix acres of hnd to be meafured out of their moor of King's Meaburne, at the 
north end thereof-, paying to them and their heirs yearly, for all fervices, fix 
(hillings.
In the 1 Ed 3.
after the death of Roger lord Clifford, the inquifnion finds, 
that he died feifed, at King's Meaburne, of a capital meffuage, the herbage 
whereof was worth by the year gs ; in demefne lands 217 acres by the greater 
hundred, all which lie uncultivated, by reafon of the want of tenants, and the 
destruction made by the Scots, the herbage whereof is worth by the year 
21 s $d; twenty-two acres of meadow, worth 22s; rent of one free tenant, 
is 8d; forty-eight oxgangs in the hands of tenants at will, worth yearly 
4/ i6s-, fixteen cottages, worth yearly i6s; water mill, 50^-, pleas and per- 
cjuifites of court, 35.
Sir Hugh de Morvil gave two oxgangs of land in Meburn to the priory of 
Carlifle ; which king Hen. 2.
confirmed ; expreffing the lame to confift of 32 
acres in Meburn Field, and the meadow at the head of two corn lands, and 
common of pafture for the cattle of their men, which they had in the days of 
Waldeve.
The priory of Wetheral had fome lands at King's Meaburn â€¢, and there is a 
grant in.
the regtfter of the faid priory of a parcel of ground there, whereon a 
grange or farm houfe was erected, by John fon of Walter de Ravenfby : 
Witneffes of which grant were, Robert de Ravenfwithe, and Thomas de Der- 
wentwater, knights ; John de Helton, Robert de Slegille, Alan le Butiler, 
Walter de Boultoi}, Hugh de Colleby, and others.
VIII.
BOLTON.
Bolton was varioufly written in ancient times â€¢, as, Boeltbun, Boeltun, Bo- 
veltbun, Bothdtun : From all which it may be conjectured that it received its 
name from the owner, Bethel, Bovel, Boel, or the like.
Bovel, and Bolt, are 
names yet in ufe in Weftmorland.
Botbwell, in Scotland, is a name well 
known.
\n the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert lord Clifford, Ralpb Baron of 
Gr-qyjlock fon of William^ held Dufton, Bolton, Brampton, and Yanewith : 
the watfdfhip whereof, when it ihould happen, was eftimated at 100 marks, and 
the cornage of the whole 25 s bd.

(Bolton.) 455 
In the 20 Ed. 2.
John de DerwcnKvater held the manor of Bolton.
For the 
Derwentwaters held the fame of theGrayftocks as mefne lords, the Grayftocks 
holding immediately of the Cliffords.
In the 11 Rio 2.
there was a writ of inquiry, concerning a breach of pri- 
vilege of parliament, by an enormous riot and forcible entry committed in 
Bokon, upon the goods, lands, fervants, and tenants of Sir John de Derwent- 
ivater, one of the knights of the fhire for Cumberland, whilft he was fitting 
in parliament.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Ralph de- Grayftoke held of the faid Roger, on the day on which he died, 
the manor of Bolton.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, John de Grayjiock held 
the fame.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
it is found by inquifition, that Nicholas Radcliff then held 
Bolton of Ralph baron of Grayjlock, as the faid baron held the fame of Thomas 
de Clifford.
At the difTolution of the abbey of Shap, it appears that the faid ab u bey had 
a rent out of Bolton of \6d a year, paid by Sir Cuthbert Ratcliffe knight.
In the r and 2 Ph. and M.
George Raldiffe knight held Bolton of William lord 
Dacre, as the faid lord Dacre held the fame of Henry earl of Cumberland.
Afterwards, the Fletchers of Hutton purchafed the manor of Bolton, in 
which family it ftill continues.
Jeffrey Wybergh, a younger brother of the 
Wyberghs of Clifton, purchafed the hall and demefne; whole fon Thomas Wy- 
lergh fold the fame to his father's filter Mrs. Dorothy Halton, widow of Mr.
Miles Halton who had been fteward at Grayftock caflle-, who gave the fame to 
her younger fon Miles Halton-, who had a daughter and heir Dorothy married to 
Edward Birket, M.
A. prebendary of Carlille, whofe fon Henry Birket efquire 
now enjoys the fame.
King Henry the fecond confirmed to the priory of Carlille certain lands 
lying between Bolton and Colby, which were in calumnia (debateable lands) 
with common of pafture and other eafments there, given by Uchtred and 
Adam his heir.
The priory of Wetheral had five tenements in Bolton of the yearly rent in 
the whole of 2/ r is Bd.
And in the year 1326, an inquifition was taken in St. Laurence's church in 
Appleby, before Robert de Southaic official of bifhop Rofs, upon this queftion, 
"Who ought to furnifh the chantry in the chapel of Bolton ?
The fubftance 
of the evidence was, that theanceftors of Sir John de Derwentwater founded 
the faid chantry, and when there wanted veftments or other ornaments in the 
faid chantry, the lord and his bailiff diftrained the goods and chattels of the 
tenants of the prior of Wederhal in Bolton, and kept the fame; and that on 
complaint thereof by the tenants to the prior, the prior diftrained the vicar to 
find a chaplain ; and that whatever might be between the prior and vicar, the

lord and his bailiff kept the diftrefs, till all the faid things were provided.
But whether the land was fpecially charged in the firft endowment to find the 
fame, the witneffes knew not *.
Before the augmentation by the governors of queen Anne's bounty, the re- 
venues of the chapel were certified to amount to 4/ 10s a year: Which did 
arife from 3 /a year paid by the vicar of Morland, and 30 s a year arifing from 
the produce of the chapel yard, furplice fees, and the tithes of garths in Bol- 
ton, and of chickens, eggs, ducks, hemp, and flax, throughout the lordfhip 
of Bolton.
In the year 1754, this chapel received an augmentation of 200/ 
by lor, with which an eftate was purchafed in the parifh of Orton.
And in the 
year 1761, the lady Gower gave 200/, being part of a charity of her father 
Thomas earl of Thanet; whereupon other 200/ were obtained from the go- 
vernors of the faid bounty of queen Anne; with which fum of 400/ an eftate 
was purchafed at Bolton.

Eaftward from Bolton, and about a mile and an half weft from Appleby, is 
a pleafant feat belonging to the bifhop of Carlifle, called Buley castle, on 
the fouth fide of Eden, oppofite to Crackenthorp.
It was formerly con- 
troverted, but is now agreed to be in Morland parifh.
It was fo called, from its being built by, or belonging unto John Builly, 
whofe daughter and heir Idonea was married to the firft Robert de Veteripont.
It is now a mean ruinous building; but anciently the bifhops fometimes 
refided here.
Several ordinations have been held at this place.
And divers 
â– confirmations of charters and other publick acts are dated from hence.

/^Liburn, Cleburn, Cleyburn^ feems to derive the name from its fituation.
^ J Burn is a rivulet or brook.
And there is in the foil here a courfe of clay f 
which difcovers itfelf in the channel and banks of the rivulet called Leetb* 
which runs on the weft fide of the village, and falls into Lyvennet below Cli- 
burn mill.
The parifh is bounded on the eaft, fouth, and weft, by the parifh of Mor- 
land ; and on the north, by the parifties of Lowther, Clifton, and Brougham j 
and contains about 36 families, all of the eftablifhed church.
The church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert.
It is a rectory, in the patronage 
of the bifhop of Carlifle; rated in the king's books at glis^fd: the 
clear yearly value, as certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 
40/ 10s.
This, though it ftill continues a rectory, was appropriated to the abbey of 
St. Mary's York.
And the reafon why it continued a rectory molt probably 
was, becaufe the parifh was fo fmall, that the revenues thereof would do little 
more than maintain an incumbent to perform the duty.
And this might be a 
reafon why the advowfon, on a difpute, was given up to the bifhop of Carlifle, 
and a fmall penfion only referved to the abbey ; for they could not both main- 
tain a vicar, and receive any thing confiderable for themfelves.
The appropriation was early.
By whom, hath not appeared to us.
But it 
was confirmed by Athelwold firft bifhop of Carlifle, who came to the fee in 
the reign of king Henry the firft.
In the time of Walter Mauclerk, fourth bifhop of Carlifle, the abbot 
and convent aforefaid, on an arbitration, were ordered to give up the perpetual 
advowfon of the church of Cliburn, to the bifhop and his fuccefTors.
And accordingly, in the year 1284, the faid abbot and convent granted to 
Silvefter bifhop of Carlifle and his fucceffors, the advowfon of the church of 
Cliburn j Saving to the faid abbey the ufual penfion *.
Which penfion at firft was 10 s yearly ; as appears from the acknowledgment 
of Nicholas Malveyfin^ rector of Cliburn about that time f.

branch probably of the ancient family of Talebois barons of Kendal.
Cliburn 
Hervey feems alfo to have received its denomination from the owner ; but it 
had gone out of that name before the commencement of any of our accounts.
In the 14 Ed. 1.
in the partition of the Veteripont inheritance between the 
two daughters and coheirs of the lad Robert, the homage and fervice of Lucas 
Talebois were affigned to Idonea the younger fitter, for Clebum Talebois.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
Lucas Talebois held of Robert de Clifford one moiety of the 
manor of Cliburn; the wardfhip whereof was valued at 13/ 6s Sd t and the 
cornage was 12 s \\d.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Walter de Talebois held the manor of Cliburn Talebois.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
Walter de Talebois in like manner held the fame.
Again, in the 10 Hen. 5.
Walter de Talebois held the manor of Cliburn Ta- 
lebois and alfo Kirkeber, by the cornage of i^s 47^.
, 
After this, we no further meet with the name of Talebois.
It ended in a 
daughter Elizabeth, married to Robert le Franceys of Cliburn * ; of an ancient 
family there; for in the 20 Ed. 1.
there was one John Franceys of Cliburn, 
who was a juror at Appleby in a caufe between the king and the abbot and 
convent of St. Mary's York, concerning the advowfon of the two churches at 
Appleby.
The faid Robert and Elizabeth had a fon and heir John le Franceys de Cly- 
burne.
How long this moiety continued further in the name of Franceys doth not 
appear.
It became at length united (after the tenants had been mod of them 
fold free by one or other of the intermediate lords) with the Hervey moiety, 
which we proceed next to deduce.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
by the inquifition pojl mortem of Robert de Clifford, the 
jurors find, that Walter de Tylia, John de Staffoll, and Robert de Sourby (truftees 
probably in a fettlement) held a moiety of Cliburn, by the cornage of 
7s &id.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Robert de Cliburn held the manor of Cliburn Hervey.
Which Robert alfo at that time was lord of the manor of Bampton Cundale.

4 6i 
of Barton and Afkham â€¢, and on the North, by the parishes of Afkham and 
Lowther : and contains about 140 families, all of the church of England, one 
only excepted.
The whole parifh is but one townfhip or conftablewick, and probably of an- 
cient time hath been but one manor, when it received the name of Bampton.
But fo early as any account hath occurred to us, Bampton was divided into 
two parts, Bampton Patric and Bampton Cundale ; both fo called from their re- 
fpective proprietors.
Within Bampton there is a place called Knipe, which is often fpoken of as 
diftinct from Bampton; as where it is faid Bampton and Knipe Patrick, Bamp- 
ton and Knipe Cundale.
Knipe is fo called from its fituation.
It iignifies the 
top of an hill or rock.
The Saxon word is knap.
In the gofpel, where the 
Jews led our Saviour to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built (in 
order to call him down headlong), the Saxon expreffeth it by the knap of the 
munt.
The Iflandic word is gnype.
Nab is a word of the like derivation, 
fignifying the top and outermoft verge of a fteep hill.
Thus, opposite to 
Knipe, towards the eaft, we find Hardendale Nab.
The church of Bampton is dedicated to St. Patric.
It is a vicarage in the 
patronage of the crown (ever fince the difTolution of monasteries) ; and is rated 
in thf in t's books at 7/ $s; the clear yearly value, as returned to the go- 
vernors of queen Anne's bounty, 8/ 13s 4^.
And in the year 1750 it was 
certified at 33 Â£ 
It was appropriated to the abbey of Shap, about the year 11 70.
â€” Amongft 
the writings at Crackenthorp hall, there is a confirmation of this appropri- 
ation, togecher with ;hat of the church of Shap, to the faid abbey, by Robert 
bifhop of Carlifle, in the year 1263: With a grant to the abbot and con- 
vent, in refpect of the fmallnefs of their revenues, that they may officiate in 
the faid churches by two or three of their own canons, one of whom to be 
prefented to the bifhop as vicar, to be anfwerable to the bifhop in fpirituals; 
and another to be anfwerable to the abbot and convent in temporals.
Yet fo, 
that in each church they have one fecular chaplain, to hear confeffions, and 
execute fuch other matters, as cannot fo properly be done by their own regular 
canons.
Dated at Tie Rofe (apud la Rofe) on the morrow of St. John Baptift, 
1263.
And the confirmation thereof by the prior and chapter of Carlifle 
bears date on the day following*.
â€” In 1287, the fame was confirmed, in like 
form, by Ralph de Irton bifhop of Carlifle.
In the year 1300, Roger de Barton was inftituted to the vicarage of Bampton, 
on a presentation by the abbot and convent of Heppe â€¢, and the vicarage was 
taxed at SI 6s Sd, wherewith the vicar was to maintain himfelf and one 
fecular prieft : the abbot and convent to fuftain all other charges ordinary and 
extraordinary, and fubfidies granted or to be granted.
To make up which 
fum of 8/ 6s 8d, the vicar was to receive all the obventions, altarages, and 
fmall tithes ; except the tithes of wool and lamb and corn.

BAMPTON PATRIC.
In the mofl early account that we have met with of the manor of Bamp- 
ton, we find the fame divided into moieties as aforefaid, diftinguifhed by the 
names of Bampton Patric and Bampton Cundale.
Bampton Patric feems to have received its furname from the owner Pa- 
tricius de Culwen, who lived in the reign of king Henry the fecond -, from 
whom is defcended the family of the Curwens of Workington.
This Patricius or Patrick de Culwen was younger fon of Thomas, fon of 
Thomas, fon of Gofpatrick, fon of Orme, younger fon of Ketel, fon of Eldred, 
fon of Ivo de Talebois baron of Kendal in the time of William the conqueror.
The elder branch of the family, from Ketel's elder fon Gilbert, continued 
the defcent in the direct line of the barons of Kendal.
From Orme the younger 
fon aforefaid defcended the family of which we now fpeak.
Orme married Gunilda daughter of Gofpatric earl of Dunbar: By whom he 
had a fon called by his grandfather's name Gofpatric ; and he was the firft of 
the family who fettled at Workington, by an exchange made between him 
and his uncle William de Lancaftre baron of Kendal, of Middleton in Weft- 
morland, for Lamplugh and Workington in Cumberland.
â€” It is not impoffible 
but that Bampton Patrick might receive its name from this Gofpatric.
For it 
is to be obferved, that very frequently of ancient time Gofpatric was written 
Cofpatric.
Cos may feem to have been an abbreviation of Comes.
And it is 
no abfurdity to fuppofe, in thofe illiterate ages, that this Cos Patricius (Earl 
Patrick) of Dunbar, might eafily degenerate into Gofpatric.
This Gofpatric fon of Orme had a fon and heir Thomas, who founded Shap 
abbey.
Thomas was fucceeded by his fon Thomas; who dying without ifllie, Patric 
his younger brother, of whom we now fpeak, fucceeded to the inheritance.
This Patric, during the life of his elder brother Thomas, had given to him, 
by his father, Culwen in Galloway, who thereupon took the name of Pa- 
tricius de Culwen; and, Workington in Cumberland being their principal feat, 
thence came the name of the Culwens de Workington.
Which name, in procefs 
of time, degenerated into Curwen; for our anceftors, who were a military 
people, delighted in rugged and harfh pronunciations : hence they introduced 
in like manner the letter r into the found of the word Colonel.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Gilbert de Culwen [brother and heir of Thomas, fon of the faid Patric] 
held of the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, Bampton Patric and 
Gnype Patric, and alfo the manor of Hepp ; the wardfhip whereof, when it 
mould happen, was worth 52/, the coinage 26s yd.
Again, in the 43 Ed. 3.
Gilbert de Culwen [grandfon of the faid Gilbert'] held 
of the Cliffords the manor of Gnypp; and the faid Gilbert de Culwen, the abbot 
of Hepp, and Robert de Cliburne, held the manor of Bampton Patric, by ho- 
mage and fealty, and the cornage of 13 s ^d.

In the 15 Ric. 2.
Gilbert de Culwen and Robert de Cliborne held Bampton Pa- 
tryke and Knipe Patryke, by the cornage of 15s yd.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
Chrijlopher deCurwen and John de Cliburn held the manor of 
Bampton Patric and Knype Patric, by the cornage of 15 j 10 d.
In the 1 Hen. 6.
Sir Chrijlopher Curwen, knight, purchafed certain lands at 
Bampton Skewes ; one of the witneffes to which purchafe was Edward Culwen 
efquire.
By an inquifition in the 19 Hen. 7.
it was found, that Bampton Patric and 
Knipe Patrick were holden by Chrijlopher Culwen by knights fervice, to wit, by 
homage, fealty, and fcutage, namely, for Bampton Patric, when fcutage runs 
at ten pounds, 10 s ; and cornage 13^4^; for Knipe Patric, when fcutage runs 
at ten pounds, 4JJ and cornage lys.
That the faid Chrijlopher Culwen died 
on the 6 Apr. 14 Hen. 7.
And that Thomas his fon and heir was of the age 
of 30 years at his father's death.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
the heir of Thomas Curwen knighc and Thomas Cliburne 
held the fame.
Finally, we find the fame in the name and family of Warwick; of whom 
Francis Warwick efquire fold the manor to the prefent owner Edward Haffel 
efquire ; referving the demefne, of which he died feifed in 1772, and was fuc- 
ceeded by his fifter Mrs. Anne Warwick.
III.
BAMPTON CUNDALE.
We come next to the other part of Bampton, which belonged to the fa*- 
mily de Cundale.
Where that dalt is, from whence this family received their 
denomination, hath not occurred to us.
But that they communicated this their 
name to Bampton Cundale there can be no doubt.
So early as the reign of king Henry the fecond, we find Henry de Cundale 
(amongft other principal, men of note) witnefs to a coropromife between the 
abbot of Byland and others, concerning the boundaries of the manor of Bleat- 
arn belonging to the faid abbot and convent.
And in the 13th of king John, Henry de Cundall was one of the witneffes to 
the grants of the firft Robert de Veteripont to Shap abbey.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert lord Clifford, Henry de Cundale 
held Bampton Cundale and Gnype ; the wardQiip whereof, when it fhould 
happen, was worth 13 I 6s 2d; the cornage 15J 3d.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
the abbot of Hepp, William de Hornby, Gilbert de Culwen, 
and Robert de Cliburne, (probably as truftees) held the manor of Bampton 
Cundale, by the cornage of 1551 id.
â€” For now it feems to have gone off with a 
daughter of Cundale, married to Cliburn.
For in the i5Ric. 2.
after the death 
of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition finds, that Robert de Cliburn and Mar- 
garet his wife, as in right of the faid Margaret, held of the faid Roger the 
manor of Bampton Cundale, by the cornage of 15J 3 d.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
John de Clyburne held the fame.
In the 3 1 Hen. 6.
Roland Clyburn held Bampton Cundale and Knipe, by 
homage and fealey and 15*3^ cornage, owing aifo for the fame ward (hip, 
5 marriage,

marriage, relief, and fuit to the county court.
And afterwards, in the fame 
year, John Cliburn held the fame : Which heretofore (as the inquifition fets 
forth) were held by Ralph de Cundal.
In the 19 Hen. 7.
it was found by inquifition, that^^w Clyborne held Bamp- 
ton Cundale of Henry lord Clifford, by homage, fealty, and fcutage ; when 
fcutage runs at ten pounds, 10 s ; when more, more; when lefs, lefs : and the 
cornage of 15 s yd.
That the faid John died 8 Aug. 4 Hen. 7.
And that 
Thomas Clyborne his fon and heir was then 22 years of age.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
Thomas Clyborne held the fame, by the like fervices.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and M.
Richard Clibbum held the fame, of Henry earl of 
Cumberland.
Laft of all, this, like many other neighbouring places, came by purchafc 
to the houfe of Lowther.
Within the bounds of this parifh is a large lake called Hawes-water well re- 
plenifhed with fundry kinds of fifh : Nigh unto which is Meafand fchool, en- 
dowed by Richard Wright formerly of Meafand, with the profits of an eftate 
now let at about 24/ -per annum, out of which is deducted yearly about 3/ for 
finding books for poor fcholars and other out-payments.

Nor doth it at all derogate from this account, that there 
are at prefent few fhrubs of that kind there ; for the face of the country is 
totally altered fince thofe ancient times â€¢, for all was then foreft and wood,

The parifh of Shap is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Morland and 
Croiby Ravenfworth ; on the South, by the parifhes of Crofby Ravenfworth 
and Orton; on the Weft, by the parifhes of Kendal, Bampton, and Barton-, 
and on the North, by the parifhes of Bampton, Lowther, and Morland : And 
contains about 182 families; all of the church of England except one or 
two.
The church is dedicated to St. Michael the archangel; as appears from the 
will of one Sir Thomas Tipping prieft, bearing date in the year 1540 *.
It is a vicarage, rated in the 36 Hen. 8.
at 8/ j $s y^d.
The clear yearly 
value, as certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 61.
It hath fince received an allotment of 200/ from the faid governors, where- 
with an eftate was purchafed in Cumberland; and other 200/ in conjunction 
with 200/ given by the countefs dowager Gower, with which an eftate was 
purchafed in Stavely in the county of Weftmorland.
About the year 1170, Thomas fon of Cofpatric, founder of the abbey, 
gave the whole rectory of this church to the monks there ; which was con- 
firmed by bifhop Bernard, the portion of the vicarage to the faid church, con- 
Ming in the altarage, only excepted.
And amongft the Blenkinfop writings at Helbeck, there was a confirmation 
of the churches of Hep and Bampton to the faid abbey, by Thomas de Ve- 
tenpont bifhop of Carlifle, dated at Buley, on Sunday next before the na- 
tivity of the blefTed virgin Mary, 1256.
With a very fine oval feal two inches 
broad, with a bifhop in his mitre and robes, the right hand erect with a finger 
pointed up, and the left hand holding a crofier, circumfcribed with thefe words 
" Sigillum Thorns Dei gracia Karleolenfis Epifcopif." 
And the fame were again confirmed in 1263, by the then bifhop and prior 
of Carlifle ; with a grant to the abbot and convent to ferve in the faid churches 
by two or three of their own canons, one of whonvto be inftituted as vicar, 
and another to be anfwerable to the faid abbey in temporals.
In 1295, on the death of fryer Walter de Dillon one of their canons, the 
abbot and convent Vallis Magdalena de Hepp prefent fryer William de Kirkedal, 
another of their canons, to the vacant vicarage of Hepp, who was thereupon 
inftituted.
In 1319, Thomas de Wynton, canon of Hepp, was prefented and inftituted.
In 1333, the abbot and canons had licence from bifhop Kirkby, to remove 
the body of Ifabella wife of William de Langleigh de Appleby, their pa- 
rifhioner, famed for having miracles done by it, to fome proper place within 
the church Â©r churchyard of Hepp; that the reliques might be reverenced by 
the people, with freer and greater devotion.
In 1342, on the refignation of fryer John de Richmund vicar of Hepp, the 
abbot and convent prefent the abbot John de Langeton.
In 1397, Robert abbot of Hepp appealed to the pope, againft Richard 
Pyttes vicar general of the bifhop of Carlifle, who had fequeftred the profits 
of the parifh church of Hepp; alledging, that the faid benefice, except only

the altarage fettled on the vicar, was appropriated to him the faid abbot and 
his convent, and had been fo for time whereof the memory of man was not to 
the contrary.
In 1514* the abbot and convent of Shap fue for an half burgage in Cock- 
ermouth, bought by Alexander Ynglijh late vicar of Shap, with money of which 
he had defrauded the faid monaftery.
In 1574, after the death of Sir John Whinfell, vicar of Shap; Sir John 
Brockbank was collated, on a lapfe, by bifhop Barnes.
â–  
This vicarage being fo very fmall, few pcrfons have been willing to be at 
the expenceof inftitution and induction â€¢, but it hath been generally fuffered to 
go in lapfe, and fupplied by curates under a fequeftration.
But having re- 
ceived augmentations by the governors of queen Anne's bounty, it hath fince 
become neceflary to have vicars canonically appointed.
Accordingly, in 1 ygg, 
William Langhorne clerk was pre fen ted under the great feal ; and on his death 
in 1775, James Holme clerk was prefented by Sir James Lowther baronet, 
and instituted thereupon.
â€” The aforefaid augmentations were, 200/ which 
came by lot, wherewith a purchafe was made of houfes and lands at Seathwaite 
in the parifh of Crofthwaite, and two cattle gates on Seathaller or Wad-Fell ; 
and 400 /, whereof 200 / was given by lady Gower, with which an eftate was 
purchafed in Stavely.
The church is a pretty large ancient building; with a fquare tower, and three 
bells.
At the end of the fouth ile, is a chapel or burying-place belonging to Rof.

ABBEY AND MANOR OF SHAP.
The abbey of Shap was transferred hither from Prejlon in Kendale â€¢, per- 
haps for the fake of the fituation, which is in a lonely vale, on the weft fide- 
of the river Lowther, about a mile weft from the church of Shap, well adapted 
to the purpofes of retirement and contemplation.
Thomas fon of Cofpatric by his charter without date (which was about the year 
1119, in the 20 Hen. 1.) gave to God and St. Mary Magdalene and the canons 
of Prefton of the order of Praemonftratenfes, a portion of his lands at Prefton 
in Kendale, to build a manfion for the faid canons, to wit, his whole demefne 
park there, and other lands, fpecifying the refpeclive metes and bounds.
He 
grants to them alfo as much of his woods as they had a mind to take, and alfo 
the bark of fuch wood as they mould cut down, without the view of his fo- 
refters, and maftage alfo for their hogs, and the tithe of his pannage : And

Margaret wife (or rather widow) of Sir Hugh de Lowther, 
gave all her lands in Weftmorland to the faid abbey (which after a courfe of 
near 400 years came back into the family by their purchale of the abbey pof- 
feflions.) 
Befides thefe and many other grants of lands, the abbey had the rectories 
and advowfons of the churches of Warcop, B amp ton, and Shap.
They had alfo the manor of Shap.
This manor appears of ancient time 
to have belonged to the Culwens (of the family of Culwen, corruptly Curwen, 
of Workington) held under the Cliffords lords of Weftmorland.
In the 
8 Ed. 2.
Gilbert de Culwen held the faid manor.
In the 34 Ed. 3.
Gilbert, 
grandfon of the faid Gilbert de Culwen, knighr, releafcd to the faid abbey all 
his right in certain lands and tenements in Shap, which he had of the infeoff- 
ment of Hugh de Lowther knight, and which the faid Hugh had of Thomas 
de Prefton : The deed is fealed with a frett, and chief charged with a crefcent.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
we find the manor itfelf held jointly by the abbot of Hepp 
and Chrifiopber Curwen : And afterwards the whole manor appears in poffeffion 
of the abbey, by gift (no doubt) of the Curwens.
The ftate of the revenues of this abbey at the d : flblution, will bed appear 
from the particulars of the grant thereof by the crown to the Wharton family.
King Henry the eighth, in the 36th year of his reign, granted (together with 
the monaftcries of Giflmrn and Rival in Yorkfhire) the monaftery of Shap, to 
Sir "Thomas Wharton knight, lord Wharton, and the heirs male of his body, to 
hold of the king by the fervice of the twentieth part of one knight's fee, 
and paying for the whole into the court of augmentations 41/ 11 s yearly, 
with the revcrfion thereof in the crown.
Afterwards, king James the firft, in 
the ninth year of his reign, for the faithful fervice of Sir George Wharton, 
knight of the Bath, late deceafed, [which Sir George was killed in a rencounter 
by Sir James Stuart] and other confederations, granted to Philip lord Wharton, 
and Thomas Wharton knight, fon and heir apparent of the laid Philip and 
brother of the faid George, the reverfion and remainder.
The particulars 
whereof are as follows : 
" The houfe and lite of the monaftery of Shappe, and the demefne and 
manor of Shappe, and all the tithes of corn, hay, wool, lambs, and other 
tithes whatfoever yearly accruing of and in the faid fite and demefne lands of

41 / 11s, the payment thereof to commence, after the heirs male of the body of 
the faid Thomas lord Wharton Ihall be extinct, or the aforefaid tail in the pre-

This abbey and the faid revenues thereof continued in the Wharton family 
till the time of the late duke, when the fame were fold together with their 
other eftates and manors in Weftmorland to Robert Lowther efquire, father of 
the prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet.
The faid abbey was not exempt from the ordinary jurifdiction : On the con- 
trary, the abbots were admitted by the bifhop of the dioceie ; unto whom, at 
the time of their admiffion, they fwore canonical obedience.
Thus in the year 
1379, Robert Marefchall the abbot made oath before bifhop Appleby, that he 
would pay reverence and due fubjection to the faid bifhop and his fucceffbrs 
and to the apoftolic fee (faving the privileges of h s order) *.
And in the abfence of bifhop Kite, in the year 15 19, at the requeft of the

the abbot of Shap ; and on the 25th of March following, in the cathedral 
church of Durham, the faid abbot received folemn benediction by the fuffragan 
of that fee, with the ceremonies of the paftoral flaff, facerdotal girdle, and 
ring*.
In Henry the eighth's Valor in the 26th year of his reign, there is an Item 
of 10s a year oblaticns injlipite at the faid abbey.
Perhaps this might be for 
fuel, in flumps of trees grubbed up, after the wood was deftroyed.
This abbey was valued at the diffolution at 154/ ys y^d a year; yet it was 
not diffolved in the 2'/ Hen. 8.
amongft thofe which were rated under 200/: 
And the reafon might be, becaufe the adt in that year fpeaks cf thofe which 
contained under the number of 12 perfons, whereas in this abbey there were 
2.0 religious.
Or perhaps Henry earl of Cumberland, the patron thereof, 
who was highly in favour with that king, might have intereft to fave it in that 
firft attack..
The faid abbey was not furrendered till the 14th of January in the 31 Hen. 8.
and therefore was amongft thofe whofe furrenders were confirmed by the act 
of parliament in that year; and being one of the privileged orders, its poffeffions 
were amongft thofe which were capable of being difcharged from tithes.
And 
yet it hath never been inferted in any of the lifts of monafteries diffolved in that 
year ; and the reafon hath been, becaufe thofe lifts contain only fuch houfes as 
were valued at 200/ a year or upwards.
The laft abbot was Richard Evenwcde, as he fubferibed his name to feveral 
inftruments yet extant; but he furrendered the abbey by the name of Richard 
Eaggot : whether he was illegitimate, and fubferibed by the name of his mother 
or reputed father promifcuoufly, or it was done intentionally that thefurrender 
thereby might be void, or how otherwife this happened, hath not appeared to 
us.
He was living in the firft year of queen Mary, and enjoyed a penfion of 
40/ a year.
And of the canons and officers there were then furviving 13 per- 
fons, each of whom had penfions as follows : Hugh Watfcnne, Robert Barlonde, 
Jchn Addijon, Edward Michael, and Edmund Carter, 6/ each; Martin Macka- 
rethe, John Dawjtone, and Richard Me/I, 5/ each ; John Bell, 5/ 6 s 8d; George 
Ellerjlon, Anthony John/on, John Rode, and Ralph Watfonne, 4/ each.
Amongft the writings at Crackenthorp, there is a teftimonial of one Tho- 
mas Sawleman clerk, in the year 1444, with the common feal of the abbey, 
partly defaced.

The taxation to be paid at Rome for admiffion to the dignity of abbot was

And confidering the diminution in the value of money, thefe florins might 
now be reckoned as pounds.
The church of the abbey appears to have been a fpacious building.
The 
tower thereof at the weft end is yet {landing; on the eaft part whereof are the 
marks where the roof of the church hath adjoined to it.
Nigh thereunto is a 
little farm houfe, which hath formerly been fome of the offices.
Juft below 
the abbey are the ruins of an old bridge, the pillar whereof in the midll of 
the water is yet remaining.
About half a mile to the north eaft is a farm houfe 
called the Grange, which belonged to the abbey, with fpacious fields ad- 
joining.
There were alfo fome lands at Shap which belonged to the abbey of Byland 
in Yorkfhire, given by the aforefaid Thomas fon of Cofpatric to God and St.
Mary de Bellalanda : He granted alfo to the faid abbey of Byland pafture for 
500 fheep in Heppe and Heppefhow.
In the year 1687, June 24, Philip lord Wharton procured a charter for a 
market at Shap weekly on Wednefday, and three fairs yearly, viz.
on the 
23d and 24th of April, the ill and 2d of Auguft, and the 17th and 1 8 th of 
September.
And on the 14th of December in the faid year, the faid lord Wharton, in 
confederation of one year's cufiomary rent paid by the tenants of the faid ma- 
nor, granted to them and their heirs to be free from toll in the faid market 
and fairs.
Towards the fouth end of the village of Shap, near the turnpike road, on 
the eaft fide thereof, there is a remarkable monument of antiquity; which is 
an area upwards of half a mile in length, and between 20 and 30 yards broad, 
encompaffed with large ftones (with which that country abounds) many of 
them three or four yards in diameter, at 8, 10, or 12 yards diftance, which are 
of fuch immenfe weight that no carriages now in ufe could fupport them.
Undoubtedly this hath been a place of Druid worfhip, which they always 
performed in the open air, within this kind of inclofure, fhaded with wood, 
as this place of old time appears to have been, although there is now fcarce a 
tree to be feen (Shap-Tbom only excepted, planted on the top of the hill for 
the direction of travellers).
At the high end of this place of worfhip, there 
is a circle of the like ftones about 18 feet in diameter, which was their fan Hum 
fantlorum (as it were) and place of facrifice.
The (tone is a kind of granite, 
and when broken appears beautifully variegated with bright fhining fpots like 
fpar The country people have blafted and carried away fome of thefe ftones, 
for the foundation ftones of buildings.
In other places, fome have cut thefe 
ftones (but with difficulty) for milftones.
When polifhed, they would make 
beautiful chimney-pieces.

Within the parifh of Shap, is the manor of Rosgill or Rosegill ; pro- 
bably not fo called from any fhrub of that name growing there, as we have 
before fuppofed of Shap and of Sleagill -, but rather from Rhos or Rofe, which 
in the Brkifh fignifies a moift valley or dale.
In the reign of king Henry the third, we find John de Rofgill witnefs to a 
grant of lands at Thrimby to the priory of Wetheral.
In the 20 Ed. i.
John de Rojfegill knight was one of the jurors in a caufe 
between the king and the abbot of St. Mary's York, concerning the advowfon 
of the two churches at Appleby.
In the 5 Ed. 3.
Sir John de Rojfegill was witnefs to an exchange of lands, be- 
tween Sir Hugh de Lowther and the prior of Watton.
In the 18th of the fame king, Robert de Rojfegill is the firft in the lift of 
jurors upon the inquifition pofi mortem of Robert de Clifford.
The laft of the Rofgills, whether this Robert or another, had a daughter and 
heir Cbriflian, who in the reign of Richard the fecond was married to Hugh de 
Salkeld of Corby-caftle, who firft brought in the Salkelds to Rofgill.
Which 
Hugh was knight of the (hire for Weftmorland during the whole reign of 
king Richard the fecond, and part of the reign of king Henry the fourth.
In the 8 Ed. 4.
there is a deed of lands at Ormfi.de, to Thomas Salkeld junior, 
lord of Rofgill : Witneffes whereof, William Salkeld, Roger Salkeld.
In the 3 Hen. 8.
there is an indenture between the abbot and convent of 
Shap and Richard Salkeld of RoiTgill, fon and heir of Thomas Salkeld of Corby 
efquire.
In the 26 Hen. 8.
Thomas Salkeld held lands at Rofegill of the faid abbot 
and convent.
In the 3 and 4 Ph. and Mary, Richard Salkeld of Rofegyll efquire was one 
of the arbitrators in a difpute between Richard and Henry Machel of Crack- 
enthorp.
In the 8 Eliz.
Richard Salkeld efquire prefented a vicar to the church of 
Bampton, by virtue of a grant which had been made of that turn by the ab- 
bot and convent before their diflblution.
In the 7 Cha. 1.
by inquifition after the death of Richard Salkeld, it is found 
that he died feifed of a moiety of the manor of Rofegill, holden of the king 
in capite by knights fervice -, and that Dorothy Morhy is his filter and fole heir: 
Which Dorothy was married into the family of Chriftian of Ewanrigg in Cum- 
berland, in whom the demefne ftill continues, but the manor was fold to Sir 
John Lowther, anceftor of the prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet.
The arms of Salkeld were; Vert, a fret Argent.

the quire of the church at Shap, are the arms of Clifford and of Salkeld.

THORNTHWAITE.
Thornthwaite was anciently a large foreft.
Ic is part in the parifh of 
Shap, and the other part in the parifh of Bampton.
It anciently belonged to 
the Curwens aforefaid, until Sir Henry Curwen fold the fame to the lord William 
Howard of Naworth; who gave it to Sir Francis Howard his younger fori j 
whofe fon and heir Francis Howard of Corby efquire enjoyed the fame in the 
reign of king Charles the fecond.
By a daughter of which family it came to 
Francis Warwick of Warwick-briggs efquire, who fold the greateft part to the 
prefent owner Edward Hajfel of Dalemain efquire, retaining the other part, 
which ftill continues in the Warwick family.
V. MAR DALE.
This divifion is part of the foreft of Thornthwaite, and lies part in the parifh 
of Shap, and part in the parifh of Bampton.
The chapel of Mardale is in the 
parifh of Shap: the prefent revenue whereof is about 26 1 per annum, being 
the produce of three allotments of queen Anne's bounty of 200/ each, and of 
75 / contributed by feveral different perfons.
VI.
S WIN DALE.
This alfo is part of Thornthwaite foreft â€¢, which extended wide in thefe un- 
cultivated places.
It may have received its name, either from the fituation, 
as Sivin fignifies inclining or crooked ; fo there is Crookdale in this fame parifh 
of Shap: Or it may be io called from wild boars having frequented there; 
as there are Grifedale, Boredale, Sty barrow, in the neighbouring parifh of Bar- 
ton ; and Wildboarfell'm Raven ftondale.
Hogherd (we have feen) was a name in 
this parifh, now corruptly written Hoggart, or (as varied by the late excellent 
painter of that name who was of Westmorland extraction from Kirkby Thore) 
Hogarth .
At this place is a fmall chapel, which was built by the inhabitants to an- 
fwer the purpofe both of lchool and chapel.
There was a fmall endowment 
for a fchoolmafter, and he was permitted to read prayers on Sundays.
By an 
allotment of queen Anne's bounty, the chapel and fchool together are now 
worth about fixteen or feventeen pounds a year.

MOSEDALE.
Mosedale, Mofs-dale, is a wild, bleak, mojfy, and mountainous dale ; but 
profitable for fine blue flate : which, fince it was found out (which is not a 
century ago), hath quite altered the face of the country as to building.
It is a

vicinity, cheaper than thatch, becaufe durable.
Much of it, by land-carriage, 
is conveyed over Stanemore into the counties of Durham and York.
This dale alfo is the property of the faid Edward HaiTel efquire.
VIII.
WET SLEDDALE.
South-weft about a mile and an half from Shap is the hamlet of Sleddale 
Ska-dale, diftinguifhed from another Sleddale in the barony of Kendale by the 
.name of Wet Sleddale ; for if any rain is ftirring, the air fcoops it furprifinorly 
into the hollow of that dale.
We have obferved before, that Sleddale Grange belonged to the abbey or 
Shap.
In the year 1360, there is a remarkable circumftance in the bilhop's 
regiftry relating to this grange.
Complaint being made of fome unknown 
perfons riotoufly breaking into the houfes and grange of the abbot and con- 
vent of Hepp at Sleddale, and committing feveral diforders there; the bifhop 
ifiues out his mandate to the dean (rural) of Weftmorland, and to the re&or 
of Lowther, the vicars of Hepp, Morland, and Crofby Ravenfwath, to de- 
nounce the greater excommunication, at the time of high mafs, when the 
greateft number of people mould be gathered together, the bells ringing, and 
the candles lighted and put out, againft the faid rioters.
IX.
HARDENDALE AND WASDALE.
Next we come to the manor of Harden dale and Wasdale (Wajle dale).
This manor belonged to Byland abbey in Yorkfhire.
By whom it was given, 
â– we have not found.
Thomas fon of Cofpatric (we obferved before) gave fome 
lands at Shap to this abbey, and it is not unlikely that he gave alfo Harden- 
dale and Wafdale.
After the diflblution, king Henry the eighth, in the 35th year of his reign, 
granted to Chriftopher Crackenthorp of Newbiggin efquire, and his heirs, the 
manor of Hardenefdale (otherwife Hardendale) and Wafdale ; together with the 
meffuages, tenements, and other hereditaments, in the tenure and poiTefiion 
of Thomas Sander/on, Michael Sander [on, John Kytchyn, Henry Ccperthwaite, 
JVilliam Kytchyn.
John Sander/on, William Lowes, William Atlynfon, Thomas 
Robynfon, Chriftopher Winter, Simon Lykbarry, John Lykbarry, Richard Pullo, 
Richard Wafshingt on, Thomas Byrkhead, Edward Lowther, and Miles Howe, lying 
and being in Hardendale and Wafdale ; together with all knights fees, el- 
cheats, reliefs, heriots, court leet and view of frankpledge, alTize of bread, 
beer, and ale, waifs, eftrays, free warren, and all other rights in Hardendale, 
Wafdale foot, and Wafdale head : Paying to the king, his heirs and fucceffors, 
1 6 s yearly into the court of augmentations.
The faid manor ftill continues in the pofterity of the faid Chriftopher, in 
like manner as the Newbiggin and other eftates.

At Hardendale was born the learned Dr. John Mill, principal of Edmund

Oppofite to Wafdale foot, but in the parifli of Crofby Raverifworth, by the

I. PARISH OF ORTON.
RTON is nothing but a contraction of Overton, the fituation of which 
place fufficiently fhews its derivation.
There are many places in England 
of the fame name.
Sometimes this place was diftinguifhed by the name of 
Sker-Overton, from the fear under which it Hands.
It is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Afby, Crofby Garret, and 
Ravenftondale ; on the South, by the parifh of Sedbergh in the county of 
York, and the parifh of Kendal; on the Weft, by the faid parifh of Kendal; 
and on the North, by the parifhes of Shap, Crofby Ravenfworth, and Afby : 
And confiftsof about 360 families, all of the church of England, except one 
quaker family.
The church is dedicated to All Saints.
It is a vicarage, in the gift of the 
land-owners within the parifh; fo that there are about 240 patrons; who, to 
avoid confufion, keep the advowibn in the hands of truftees, who are bound 
to prefent according to a majority of votes upon an election-day.
It is rated 
in the king's books at 16/ 17J 34^.
This church was appropriated to the priory of Conifhead [Conyng's-heved] 
in Lancafhire, in the reign of king Henry the fecond ; and there is a confirm- 
ation thereof by John Bartholomew, prior of Carlifle, in the time of Hugh 
third bifhop of Carlifle.
Vol. I.
3 Q^ The 
4 8 2 PARISH OF ORTON.
The perfon who gave the fame to the faid priory was Gamel de Penigton ; 
as appears by the confirmation thereof by king Edward the fecond in the i 2th 
year of his reign : who, reciting the feveral grants which had been made to 
the faid priory, confirms the fame, and amongft the reft " the grant which 
" Gamel de Penigton made to the canons of the faid place, of the churches 
14 of Penigton, Molcaftre, and Sker-Overton, with the appurtenances*." 
There is another recital in the faid confirmation, of an acre of land in Over- 
ton, called Frerebiggins, given by Alan fon of Alan de Penigton, to the canons 
of the faid place.
And another recital of two acres and an half and thirty perches of land in 
Overton, given by Thomas de Mufgrave.
The place called Frerebiggins^ probably received its name from having be- 
longed to the friers or brethren of the faid priory.
For there are no footfleps 
remaining of any other religious fociety, which had any poffefiions within the 
manor of Orton.
Below Frerebiggins, there is a place called Freremire\ and 
there is a parcel of turbary called Frere-mofs y which probably was given by the 
Penigtons, lords of the manor, together with the lands at Frerebiggins, to the 
faid priory.
There were two mefluages and tenements belonging to the churcrt 
and priory (which are mentioned in the valuation in the twenty-fixth year of 
king Henry the eighth), of which there are no traces any where now to be 
found, except only at the faid Frerebiggins.
The vicar hath about nine acres 
of land there ftill, but no dwelling-houfe.
The reft were probably alienated 
by the priory, as was very frequently done by the religious houfes, on the ap- 
prehenfion of their approaching diflblution ; and there was no law to reftrain 
them.
â€” There is indeed a place called The Chapel, about half a mile fouth 
from the church : But that feems only to have been for the fake of receiving 
the oblations of perfons reforting to a well there, called Lady-well ; which 
was reported to have falutary effects in divers maladies.
And there are many 
wells throughout the country, to which the fuperftition of thofe times attri- 
buted the like virtues â€¢, that is to fay, in plain Englifh, they were efficacious in 
all cafes wherein cold water in general is lb.
The firft vicar that appears upon record after the church was given to the 
priory was Sir Richard de Bernard Caftle; who, in the year 1293, was prefented 
to the vacant vicarage of Ovyrton by the prior and convent of Conyngfheved ; 
unto whom institution was thereupon given by bifhop Halton.
In 1302, one Henry, whofe furname is not recorded, was vicar of Overton, 
being prefented in the fpi ritual court, and cited for incontinency ; whereupon 
he became bound to the bifhop in 20 marks, to be forfeited, if thereafter he 
mould be charged and convicted of incontinency with any woman.
In 1338, on the death of Thomas de rfppleby vicar of Overton, the prior and 
convent of Conyngfheved prefent one of their own canons, Richard de Weffmg- 
ton; for whofe inftitution the bifhop grants a commiffion, notwithstanding his 
being a canon regular.

In 1373, one Sir Robert de Berde/hay was vicar of Overton ; on whofe death, 
the prior and convent of St. Mary's de Conynges-heved preiented Sir Thomas 
Bell, one of their own canons.
In the year 1455, William Birkbeck^ vicar of Overton, was a truftee in a 
marriage fettlement of Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquire, of certain 
lands which the Blenkinfops had at Overton.
In 1534, one Thomas Lorde appears to have been vicar of Overton.
In 1573, on the death of Philip Machel vicar of Overton, inftitution was 
given to Mr. Robert Cortiey, on a prefentation by queen Elizabeth, in right of 
her duchy of Lancafter (after the diffolution of the priory of Conifhead).
In 1594, upon the death of the faid Robert Corney, a caveat was entred by 
Gerard Lowther efquire, high iherifF of the county of Cumberland, in claim 
of the right of prefentation of Sir John Puckering lord keeper of the great 
feal.
But in about a fortnight after, the bifhop granted inftitution to Henry At- 
kinfott, M.
A. prefented as before by queen Elizabeth in right of her duchy of 
Lancafter.
I n J 595Â» Mr. Atkinfon being dead, John Corney, M.
A. was instituted on a 
prefentation in the fame form as before by quesn Elizabeth.
During the incumbency of this John Corney, the rectory and advowfon were 
purchafed of the crown, by Francis Morice of the city of Weftminfter efquire, 
and Francis Phelips of the city of London gentleman (who purchafed divers 
other rectories, for the fake of making an advantage in felling them again).
They fold the rectory and advowfon of the parifh of Orton, in the year 16 18, 
to the faid John Corney, Edmund Branthwaite, and Philip Winder, for the 
fum of 570/, in truft for the land owners within the parifli ; and thefe three 
conveyed to 12 feoffees in truft, to prefent upon an avoidance fuch perfon to 
the vicarage, as (hall be chofen by a majority of the land owners at a meet- 
ing to be appointed by the faid feoffees within three months next after the 
avoidance ; and in truft, when the number fhall be reduced, to convey to 
other feoffees to be chofen by fuch majority as aforefaid.
And fo it ftill 
continues.
Neverthelefs, notwithstanding the faid purchafe, in the year 1637, a caveat 
was entred by one Edward Newburgh, claiming to be called on the death or 
refignation of John Corney.
And in 1639, a ^ c caveat was entred (Mr.
Corney being not yet dead) by Thomas Barlow, M.
A. Edward Birkbeck, 
and others, on behalf of themfelves and other parifhioners, claiming right of 
prefentation.
In 1643, Mr. Corney being then dead, and the living vacant, the pari- 
fhioners renewed the caveat laft mentioned ; but the bifhop's regifter book, and 
epifcopacy, failing here (fays bifhop Nicolfon), we cannot hence learn the 
iflue.
The event was this : The civil wars then raging, each party attempted to 
have a vicar of their own fide.
Some few of the inhabitants, who were of 
the parliament party, took upon themfelves of their own accord (without any 
election or application to the feoffees in truft), to prefent one Alexander Fether- 
3 Q^2 ftonhaughy 
Â«'*3 
PARISH OF ORTON.
Jlonhaugh, a chaplain in the parliament army j who obtained inftitution : but 
the parifh by force kept him out of poffeffion.
The marquis of Newcaftle, who commanded the king's majefty's forces in 
the northern parts, recommended one Mr. Lowther then in Ireland.
The land owners, according to the rule eftablifhed amongft them, elected 
one George Fothergill, and the feoffees prefented him accordingly to the bifhop 
for inftitution.
And at the fame time they excufed themfelves to the marquis 
of Newcaftle, purging themfelves of a charge of difaffection which had been 
imputed to them, and befeeching his excellency, that the election which they 
had duly made might ftand firm and unalterable, notwithftanding his excel- 
lency's commendatory letters in behalf of Mr. Lowther.
The bifhop not giving inftitution to their prefentee, they fent to him a mefc- 
fenger, with a letter, which fhews fomewhat the fpirit of the times, and the 
contempt into which the epifcopal office had then fallen.
They addrefs his 
lordfhip (or rather, his grace, for archbifhop Ufher then held the fee of Car- 
liQe in commendam) thus, " May it pleafe you, Sir." â€” And after exprefling 
their wonder, that notwithftanding Mr. Fothergill had waited on the bifhop, 
with a prefentation in form, the bifhop had not admitted him but inftituted 
another, they intreat him either to inftitute Mr. Fothergill, or to fend anfwer 
by the bearer why he refufed ; " that fo (fay they) we may take fuch further 
courfe, as law.
and prefent authority fhall afford*" 
But the bifhop having inftituted Mr. Fetherftonhaugh as aforefaid, the parifh 
filed their bill in equity, and at length Mr. George Fothergill became eftablifhed 
on the election of the land owners as aforefaid.
In 1662, he was ejected for 
not complying with the act of uniformity â€¢, but afterwards conformed, and was 
prefented to the living of Worfop in Nottinghamfhire.
On this vacancy, Roger Kenyon was elected, and thereupon prefented by the 
feoffees.
He died in 1703, at the age of 85 -, having been married to his wife 
(who furvived him) 60 years.
On the death of Roger Kenyon, Thomas Net/on, M.
A. was elected and pre- 
fented as before, and inftituted thereupon.
In 1736, on the death of Thomas Nelfon, Richard Burn , A.
B. waselected,, 
prefented, and inftituted in like manner.
He was born at Winton in this 
county, and educated at Queen's college in the univerfity of Oxford, which 
univerfity afterwards conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of 
laws.
He was author of two books, one on the office of a Juftice of the 
peace, the other on Ecclefiaftical law.
He was one of his majefty's juftices of 
the peace for the counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland, and was made by 
bifhop Lyttelton chancellor of the diocefe of Carlifle.
The church is a large old building, with a tower fteeple, and four pretty 
large bells.
They were caft at Nottingham, by John Wolley bell-founder, 
in the 21 Hen. 8.

But the bells have all or mod of them been fince re-caft.
The people come regularly to church, five, fix, or feven miles, every Sun- 
day.
And the modern practice of appropriating feats hath not yet obtained 
in this church.
All the feats, except the vicar's, are repaired at the public 
expence-, and no one of the parifhioners hath a right to any particular feat.
The contrary practice is extremely full of inconvenience in many places; par- 
ticularly in the metropolis, where one may frequently fee mod of the congre- 
gation (landing in the alleys, whilft the pews are locked up, the owners thereof 
being in the country, or perhaps in bed.

MANOR OF OR TON.
The firft lord of the manor of whom we have any account, was the afore- 
faid Gamel de Penigton (for fuch, moft probably, he was), who gave the church 
to the priory of Conifhead as aforefaid in the reign of king Henry the fecond; 
The churches were moft commonly appendant to the manors.
And that this 
family had confiderable poffefiions at Orton, appears not only from what hath 
been already obferved, but alfo from an ancient grant without date, by Alan 
fon of Alan fon of Benedict de Penigton to his uncle Simon fon of the faid Be- 
nedift, of all that moiety of Keldelitb (including one capital meffuage and te^ 
nement called The Raine), to hold to him and his heirs by the payment of 2 s 
rent yearly for all fervices and demands â€¢, doing for the fame to the king foreign 
fervice as much as appertained : Witneffes of which grant were, Ralph de 
Beethom, Gilbert de Croft, Michael de Furneis, Robert de Bonville, /William 
fon of Waldeve, Simon de Cartmell, Alan fon of Orme, Alan fon of Gilbert, 
Walter de Mulcafter, David his brother, Thomas prior of Conifhead, Alan 
parfon of Pulton, T.
parfon of Heverfham, Adam chaplain of Oldinham, 
T. chaplain of Ulverfton, R.
chaplain of Kirkby, and others.
Note, Keldelitb is what is now by contraction called Kelletb; and is derived 
of two Saxon words, keld which fignifies a well or fpring, and lytb which fig-

nifies light or foft.
There is a ftream near Kendal called Light-water, of the 
fame import.
In our next account of the manor, it appears to be divided into moieties, 
fo eariy as the reign of king Edward the firft, whether by daughters coheirs, 
or by purchafe, or how otherwife, we have not found.
In the 6 Ed. i.
we 
find clearly the manor of Orton in the hands of the Dacres of Dacre in Cum- 
berland, and the Mufgraves of Mufgrave in this county.
For in that year, 
Ramdph de Dacre obtained a grant to himielf and his heirs, as alfo to Thomas 
Mufgrave and his heirs, of a market on the Wed nefday every week, and a fair 
yearly on the eve, day, and morrow of the apoftles Simon and Jude at their 
manor of Overton; and from henceforward it continued divided into moieties, 
until the whole became united again by purchafe of the inhabitants from the 
feveral owners of the refpective moieties.
The Dacre moiety continued in- 
tire ; but the Mufgrave moiety became further divided.
Thefe moieties were 
not feparated by metes and bounds, but the owner of each moiety had te- 
nants interfperfed throughout the whole manor, and the divifion appears to 
have been made according to the refpedtive quantities of the lord's rents.
But 
for eafe and convenience this manor of very ancient time was divided into two 
townfhips or conftablewicks, now known by the names of Grtcn Lordfhip and 
Raijbeck Lordjhip ; and the divifion was as follows : " As a certain fyke be- 
tween Overton and the hamlet of RayfTebeck runs through the middle of

Next after Thomas de Mufgrave aforefaid, who lived in the reign of king 
Edward the firft, we find Richard de Mufgrave holding a moiety of the manor 
of Overton, together with the manors of Crofby Gerard and Little Mufgrave ; 
whilft at the fame time Thomas de Mufgrave, then a minor, held the manor of 
Great Mufgrave.
So that this Richard muft have been of a collateral branch, 
of the family, probably uncle of the faid minor.
This Richard de Mufgrave fold 
part of this moiety in the 29 Ed. 1.
to Adam de Henecaftre, with whofe daughter 
Avicia the fame came in marriage to Sir Thomas de Helbeck ; and by marriage of 
the heirefs of Helbeck, both that and the manor of Helbeck came to the Blen-

In the 19 Ric. 2.
Thomas de Blenkinfop of Helbeck fettled upon his fon Wil-

In the ioEd. 4.
another Thomas Blenkinfop appears by inquifition to have 
been feifed of the faid moiety ; his fon Thomas then being 33 years of age.
In the 24 Hen. 8.
Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquire, on his going to 
ferve the king's majefty againft the Scots, made his will, and thereby confti- 
tuted his brother Richard Blenkinfop, and his two uncles George, and John 
(a prieft}, together with his coufin Sir Richard Leigh prieft, truftees of his 
moiety of the manor of Overton, to take up the rents thereof, which were 1 3 / 
or thereabouts, to be employed to the beft advantage towards the ufe of his 
daughters, for fo many of them as mould come to years.
In the 14th year of queen Elizabeth, Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck gentle- 
man, fon and heir of Thomas, had livery of his lands from the court of 
wards ; and, amongft other particulars, were, half of a water mill, and 29 
mefiuages in Coteflat, Gaifgill, Tebay, Ellergill, Langdale, and Flakebrigg ; 
befides other ten held in focage, by fealty and rent of one pepper-corn.
The laft of the Blenkinfops who held this moiety, was Thomas Blenkinfop of 
Helbeck efquire, fon of Henry, who in the year 1630, together with Anne 
his wife and Elizabeth his mother, for the fum of 565 1, fÂ°ld the fame to truk 
tees for the ufe of the tenants â€¢, confifting of feventeen tenements in Raifbeck, 
eight in Sunbiggin, feven in Kelleth, three atRaifgill-hall, and five at Coatflat-, 
of the yearly finable arbitrary rent of 1 1/ 18 s 5^ d, and 4s gd mill rent : re- 
ferving the water mill at Coatflat, valued at 40 s a year.
It appears they were 
papifts-, for there was a covenant of indemnity for the fum of 20/ a month, 
or two thirds of the profits of the lands, to be forfeited for their recufancy in 
not reforting to church.
The other (hare of the Mufgrave moiety appears to have been in the hands 
of the Warcops of Smardale.
The laft of whom, viz.
Thomas Warcop of 
Smardale efquire had two daughters coheirs, married to John Dalfton of Dalfton 
in Cumberland efquire, and Talbot Bowes of Eglefton abbey in the county of 
York efquire â€¢, who in the 34 Eliz.
for the fum of 400/, fold their moiety (as 
it is called) of the manor of Overton to George Birkbeck and Robert Whitehead of 
Orton and George Sharp of Scales ; confifting of one moiety of Raifgill-hall 
mill, and 56 tenements of the yearly finable arbitrary rent of 10/ 16 s 6d.
The faid three purchafers conveyed to Edward Branthwaite, Oliver Birkbeck, 
and Roger Ward, in truft to reconvey to them their feveral fhares agreed on ; 
of whom, George Birkbeck had (befides his own eftate) 32 tenants, in Orton, 
Bousfield, and elfewhere within the manor, together with the moiety of the 
mill â€¢, Robert Whitehead, 1 1 tenants ; and George Sharp, 6 â€¢, with a rateable 
part of the waftes, and other manerial rights.
All the three purchafers, or 
their heirs or afiigns, in procefs of time, have fold moft of the refpective tene- 
ments to freehold.
And the whole manor is now become reunited in the hands 
of the freehold purchafers; and is conveyed from time to time to lords of the 
manor in truft, for the fake of keeping courts leet and baron for the conve- 
nience of the tenants.

The market at Orton, by the charter of king Edward the firft, was to be 
on Wednefday * â€¢, which charter, in the year J 655, was confirmed by Oliver 
Cromwell.
And in 1678, the faid Oliver, lord protector of the common- 
wealth, reciting a writ of ad quod damnum iffued, and an inquifition thereupon 
taken before Anne lady Clifford countefs of Pembroke and Montgomery, She- 
ri fiefs of the county of Weftmorland, grants to the inhabitants of the town 
Of Overton and their fucceffors, licence and power to hold within the faid 
town one fair yearly upon Friday before Whitfunweek, and alio a fair in every 
fortnight j the firft of the faid fairs to begin on Wednefday next after Whit- 
funweek, and to continue till the day of Simon and Jude following; with a 
court of pypowders, and power to take tolls.
The feal is about fix inches in 
diameter.
On one fide are the arms of the commonwealth, with this motto 
underneath, Pax quaritur hello : And circumfcribed, Magnum figillum Reipub-

On the reverfe, Oliver in armour on 
horfeback, and circumfcribed thus, Olivarius, Dei Gratia, Rcipublica Anglia, 
Scotia, et Hibernia Prcteclor.
And Oliver's Friday fair, has by ufage transfer- 
red the fortnight fairs, and even the market alfo, to Friday ; on which day the 
market is now kept weekly.
It is not certain where the ancient manor houfe of Orton flood.
It feems to 
have been near to the church, on the lbuth fide thereof, where are ruins to be 
feen of old buildings : And the hill afcending to the church on that fide is to 
this day called Hall-hill brow.
Raifgill ball, fituate on the rivulet called Raifbeck, nigh where it falls into 
the river Lune, is the houfe where the Blenkinfops kept their courts ; but they 
always inhabited at Helbeck.

About a mile fouth eaft from Sunbiggin in this mancr is a lake called Sun- 
biggin Tarn, furnifhed (befides eels) with a red trout not unlike char : Where 
wild ducks alfo frequent and breed.

Behind the fear, oppofite to Raifbeck, about half a mile on the eaft fide of

In which place the cattle would be fecure, until upon the alarm

It is in a folitary place, 
not likely to be fought after or found, and fituate in a large tract of naked rocks, 
the foil being warned off by the rains, and not eafily acceffible.
The place 
hath been ftrongly walled about, and contains an area of about an acre and

After the difTolution of the monafteries, this manor was granted to the 
Wharton family â€¢, and, together with other of the Wharton eftates, was pur- 
chafed in the late duke of Wharton's time, by Robert Lowther of Maulds 
Meburn efquire, whofe fon and heir Sir James Lowther baronet now enjoys 
the fame.

T E B A Y.
The manor of Tebav comprehends the vills of Ellergill, Gaifgill, Tebay, 
Rounthwaite, and Borrowdale.
In the reign of king Edward the fecond, there was one William de Eller- 
gill, who conveyed a capital mefiuage at Ellergill (which poffibly may- 
have been the ancient manor houfe) to Richard de Blenkinfop, the firft of 
that name and family at Helbeck.
And about the fame time, Richard fon of Robert de Gaisgill conveyed to 
the faid Richard de Blenkinfop divers lands and tenements there.
And thefe 
made part of the Blenkinfops' eftate in this pariih, though not in the manor 
of Orton.
Of very early time, one Radulpb de Tvbai was witnefs to a grant of lands 
at Kirkby Thore, to the abbey of Holm Cultram.
After him there was one Herbert de Tibbay who had lands at Tebay, but 
not the manor, at leaft not all of it-, for it feems to have been parcelled out 
amongft feveral owners.
The family of Haftings of Crofby Ravenfworth had 
part.
So had the family of Englijh of Little Afby.
And a fmall part was 
held under the Veteriponts and Cliffords, by the rent of 5 s for all fervices.
In the 2 Joh. Geoffrey Fitz Peter and Roger de Bellocampo, fherifFs of 
Weftmorland, accounted in the exchequer for 100 marks, paid by Herbert de 
Tibbay, Robert his fon, and Hugh de Haftings, for lands in Tibbay.
In the 2 Hen. 3.
Hugh de Haftings had a grant of free warren in Tibbay 
and Crofby.
In the 31 Ed. 1.
and again in the 14 Ed. 2.
Henry Threlkeld (of Crofby Ra- 
venfworth) had a grant of free warren in Tebay and Rounthwaite.
And in the 12 Ed. 3.
William Englijh had a like grant of free warren, with 
licence to impark 100 acres of land there.
In the 15th year of the fame king, a fine was pafTed in the exchequer of the 
manors of Tibbay and Ru nth wake ; to hold to William Englijh knight for life,, 
remainder to William his fon and the heirs male of his body, remainder to his 
fifter Julian in fee.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
the heir of Thomas de Haftings held of Robert de Clifford 
two carucates of land in Tybay, by the rent of 5s.
So in the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, Richard de Reft- 
ivold and William de Querton held divers lands in Tibay, by the rent of 5 s for 
all fervices.
In 
PARISH OF OR TON.
(Tebay.) 493 
In like manner in the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the 
inquifition finds, that Henry de Wherton and Richard Rijlwould held of the faid 
John, on the day on which he died, lands and tenements in Tybay, by fealty 
and the rent of 5 s.
This Henry de Wherton was then lord of the manor of Wharton, and lived 
at Wharton hall.
How the Whartons came to the whole manor of Tebay, we 
have not found.
The fame came from the Whartons to the Lowthers as afore- 
faid, in which family it ftill continues.
At a fmall diftance from the village of Tebay northwards, in a place called 
Caftle-green, is part of a round mount, with a trench on the outfide, called 
Cqftle-how \ part of it hath been wafhed away by the river Lune.
Oppofite to 
which, is another hill called Cajlle-how nigh Greenholme on the fouth-weft fide 
of the river Birkbeck.
They feem to have been ufed for batteries, to com- 
mand the pafies in both places.
In the 7 Hen. 7.
Humphrey de Dacre died feifed of lands in Rounthwaite.
And the Dacres and Blenkinfops had fome pofTeffions alfo in Tebay.
This feems 
to be the reafon why fome part of the land tax hath been paid all along from 
thefe places into the manor of Orton.
For generally, in afieflments to the 
fubfidies (to which the land tax fucceeded), where a man's eftate lay in fe- 
veral contiguous townfhips, he was rated for the whole in the divifion where 
he inhabited, or where the main part of his eftate lay.
And the annual land 
tax acts ftill provide, that every place fhall pay in that divifion where it paid in â€¢ 
the 3 and 4 W.
and Mary, when the land tax firft commenced.
Borrowdale hath its name from the river Borrow, which empties itfelf into 
Lune at Borrow- bridge.
On the South, about 100 paces from the bridge, 
but within the parilh of Kendal, are the ruins of a caflle, which hath been 
moated about, and from the thicknefs and ftrong cement of the walls yet re- 
maining, feems to have been a place of confiderable ftrength.
It is moft ad- 
vantageouQy fituated, to command the whole paflage through the mountains 
there.
V. BRETHERDALE.
Bretherdale is commonly faid to have had its name from three brothers 
who inhabited there fome 200 years ago.
But that is only an imagination.
It had this name long before â€¢, or rather, the name whereof this is a corrup- 
tion, and fufficiently indicates its own derivation, namely, Brere [i.
e. Brier) 
dale.
And the countenance of the place to this day is correfpondent there- 
unto.
Therefore the two other brothers fhould be Hepp and Sleagill.
This place belonged to the abbey of By land (de Bellalanda) in Yorkmirev 
being probably given to the fame by the aforefaid Thomas fon of Cofpatric.
In the reign of king Edward the firft, we find the abbot de Bellalanda hold- 
ing of the two daughters of the laft Robert de Veteripont, Afby Grange and 
Breredale, by the rent of 3 1 s i\^d for all fervices.

In the 3 1 Hen. 6.

for all fervices.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
the faid abbot held of Henry earl of Cumberland a cer- 
tain pafture called Bretherdale, in focage-, and paid yearly for the fame 5J.
After the diflblution of the monafteries, the Whartons purchafed this manor, 
which is now in the family of Lowther, as the others before.

'TpHERE are many places of the name of Crosby, which imports no more

rance of languages and etymology in former ages, have been varioufly writ- 
ten.
Amongft all the variations of the additional name of this place, that of

It was never anciently

tion could arife.

It was

by, and Afby; on the South, by the parifhes of Afby and Orton ; on the 
Weft, by the parifhes of Orton and Shap ; and on the North, by the parifhes 
of Shap and Morland : and contains about 158 families, all of the church of 
England.
It is not very certain, to whom this church was dedicated.
According to 
the account of R-andall Sander/on, M.
A. who was born in this parifh, it was 
dedicated to Sr. Laurence.
The reverend Thomas Machel fays, it was dedi- * 
cated to St. Leonard; whether this might be confounded with the hofpital of 
St. Leonard at York, which had lands here, cannot without further evidence 
be afcertained.
It is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at 7/ 13 s 4 J.

value, as certified to the governors of queen Anne's bounty, 35/ 12 s yd.
In 
1721, Colonel James Grannie gave 200/, which v/ith 200/ given by the go- 
vernors of queen Anne's bounty was laid out in lands at Lazingby, of thepre- 
fent yearly value of 20/.
Torfin de Alverftain, Ion of U^red, fon of Gofpatric, gave this church, with 
two carucates and 140 acres of land at this place, to the abbey of Whitby in 
Yorkfhire.
Whofe grant was confirmed by Alan fon of Torphin, about the 
20 Hen. 2.
and by Thomas de Haftings fon of Thomas de Haftings and grandfon 
of the faid Alan; and alfo by Athelwald firft bifhop of Carlifie, by Robert 
archdeacon of the fame fee, and by Roger archbifhop of York.
And the 
fame was afterwards appropriated to the faid abbey, by Bernard bifhop of 
Carlifie, rcferving out of the profits thereof 5/ for a vicar to celebrate therein.
Which alfo was confirmed by feveral fucceeding bifhops, and by the popes 
Gregory the ninth and Honorius the third.
Walter bifhop of Carlifie after- 
wards conftituted a perpetual vicar therein, and allotted to him the altarage, 
and 20 acres of land with two tofts, paying to the n onks of Whitby twenty fhil- 
lings per anti um ; and they were alfo to have the tithe of wool and lamb of the 
whole parifh, with two parts of the tithe hay of the whole viliage of Meburn : 
The vicar to bear all ordinary burdens, fynodals, and archidiaconal procura- 
tions â€¢, and the abbey the extraordinary.
â€” And the faid Thomas fon of Thomas 
de Haftings freed the monks and their tenants from fuit to his mill there, and 
gave them leave to grind their corn where they thought beft*.
The priory of Wetheral (under the abbey of St. Mary's York) had alfo 
fome poffeffions in this parifh, given by Ranidph de Me/chines -, and this church 
paid a penfion of 3/ 6s Sd yearly to the faid abbey, which fince the diffolution 
of monkeries is paid to the dean and chapter of Carlifie.
After the diffolution, the rectory and advowfon were purchafed by the Eel- 
linghams of Levins and Garthorne â€¢, which, together with the family eftate of 
the Beliinghams, were fold by Alan Bellin+ham efquire to the afor.efaid eolen 'I

the Lowther family ; but the advowfon continues in the hands of Henry now 
earl of Suffolk and Berkfhire, grandfon and heir of the faid Henry Bowes.
There is a tradition of a friery having been here, adjoining to the north fide 
of the churchyard.
And there feems to be fome remembrances of ir, in the 
names of Monk garth, Monks barn, and Monks bridge.
It might perhaps be 
fome fmall houfe belonging to the faid abbey of Whitby, or to fome other 
religious houfe; for this parifh had large connexions with divers other religious 
houfes.
The hofpital of St. Leonard at York, as aforefaid, had divers lands 
here.
The whole manor of Regill belonged to the abbey of Shap.
And at 
Maulds Meburn there were lands belonging to four or five different religious 
focieties.
In the year 1303, one William de Infula was vicar of Crofby Ravenfwath ; 
who in that year became bound to the bifhop in the fum of 10/, to refide upon 
his benefice, and to live foberly and continently.
In 1 36 1, John de Linton was vicar; on whofe death, the abbot and convent 
of Whitby prefented Sir Robert de Threlkeld, who was thereupon inftituted.
And on the death of the faid Sir Robert in the year following, John de Regill 
was inftituted on the like prefentation.
In the year 1572, bifhop Barnes collated, on a lapfe, Sir Chriftopher Witton 
clerk, to the faid vicarage, being vacant by the neglect of Sir Roland Thwaits 
the laft incumbent to fubfcribe the 39 Articles.
But he feems to have been 
reftored.
For in 1576, Thomas Burton, LL.
B. the bifhop's chancellor, gave 
inftitution, on the death of Roland Thwaits, to Edward Smyth clerk, prefented 
by one Richard Bacon of London, baker; by virtue of a third or fourth af- 
fignment of a grant made of the next avoidance, by the abbot and convent of 
Whitby, in the year next before their diffolution.
In 1597, on the death of the faid Edward Smyth, inftitution was given to 
William WiUaine, M.
A. on the prefentation of Thomas Bellingham of Ganhorne 
gentleman.
In the year 161 7, July 24, bifhop Snowden, upon a pretended lapfe, col- 
lated Matthias Braddel; but afterwards, on the 14th of October in the fame 
year, he gave inftitution to William Willaine clerk, prefented by Sir James Bel- 
lingham knight.
(It feemeth that this William was fon of the aforefaid Wil- 
liam, and therefore by the canon law incapacitated to fucceed his father ; and 
that he had afterwards obtained a difpenfation.) 
In the time of Oliver Cromwell, William Curwen, M.
A. appears to have 
been vicar, and by Oliver's commiflioners ejected ; but reftored on the refto- 
ration of king Charles the fecond in 1660 *.
On the death of the faid William Curwen in 1685, William Wilkinjon clerk 
was prefented by Alan Bellingham efquire, and inftituted thereupon.
In 1708, on the death of William Wilkinfon, James Wat/on clerk was in- 
ftituted on a prefentation by James Grahme efquire.

tuted on a prefentation by Henry Bowes Howard earl of Suffolk and Berkfhire 
and Catherine his wife (daughter and heir of the faid James Grahme).
The church is a fair building, having a fquare fteeple or tower, with three 
bells.
On the north fide is an ile, belonging to the hall or ancient manor 
houfe.
â€” The churchyard is a fine piece of thwaite or level ground, containing 
about two acres of land.
Belonging to this parifh are feveral charities.
The reverend Edward Holme, M.
A. gave 100/, which was laid out in 
lands at Scarfide in the parifli of Orton ; the produce thereof to be distri- 
buted in two-penny wheaten loaves weekly to poor people reforting to the 
church on Sundays.
Edward Thwaites yeoman gave a rent charge of 4/ 5s od out of Hill tene- 
ment ; whereof 50^ to be diftributed amongft the poor, 5* for a fermon on 
the day of distribution, 20 s to the fchool matter yearly, and 10s to buy 
books for poor fcholars.
Thomas Addifon yeoman gave 30/, the produce whereof to be diftributed in 
penny loaves to poor women of the lordfhip of Crofby Ravenfworth.
They have alfo an ancient poor ftock, in land or other fecurities, of 3/

But after much money fpent upon the litigated point how far owners of eftates 
in the lordfhip and truftees of the charity could be witnefles to the will; the

MANOR OF CROSBY RAVENSWORTH.
The firft lord of this manor of whom we have any account, was the afore- 
faid Torphin de Alverfiain, who gave the church to the abbey of Whitby, in 
the reign of king Henry the firft.
He had a fon Alan 9 who confirmed his father's grant, in the reign of king 
Henry the fecond.
^ This Alan fon of Torphin had a fon Thomas de Hajlings y who alfo had a fon 
Thomas de Hajlings, who confirmed the faid grant as aforefaid.
The next that we meet with was Hugh de Hajlings, who in the 2 Hen. 3.
had a grant of free warren in Crofby Ravenfwath and Tibbay.
In the fame king's reign, Hugh de Haftings appears to have held the manor 
of Crofby Ravenfwath of John de Veteripont fon of Robert.
He alfo held 
the manor of Northallerton in Yorkfhire.

In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Nicolas de Hajlings held of the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, 
the manors of Crofby Ravenfwath and Nateby, by homage and fealty, and 
zjs 2d cornage.
The wardfhip whereof, when it fhould happen, was efti- 
mated at 40/.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Ralph de Hajlings held in like manner as before the manor 
of Crofby Ravenfwath.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Richard Hajlynges held the manors of Crofby Ravenfwath and Nateby, by 
the aforefaid cornage of 27 s 2d.
By a feodary in the 31 Hen. 6.
it appears, that Edward Hajlyngs knight 
then held the manor of Crofby Ravenfwath, by the cornage of 13 s yd-, fub- 
ject alfo to wardfhip, marriage, relief, and fuit at the county court : And 
Lancelot Threlkeld knight held the fame of the faid Edward.
And henceforth 
we hear no more of Hajlings.
The arms of Hajlings were â€¢, Sable, a manch Argent.
This family of Threlkeld (whofe principal refidence was at Threlkeld in Cum- 
berland) had confiderable poffefllons in Weftmorland, and particularly at 
Crofby Ravenfworth, long before this time.
For in the 32 Ed. 1.
and again 
in the 13 Ed. 2.
Henry Threlkeld had a grant of free warren at Yanwith, Crofby 
Ravenfwath, Tebay, and Rounthwaite ; and in the 5 Hen 4.
William Threlkeld 
of Crofby knight, coufin and heir of William Threlkeld knight, father of Wil- 
liam Threlkeld of Ulvefbye, fon of John, fon of William, paid his relief for 
two parts of the moiety of the manor of Ulvefbye.
This Lancelot Threlkeld knight was fon of Sir Lancelot by Margaret daughter 
and heir of Henry Bromflett lord Vefcy, widow of the aforefaid John de 
Clifford.
This Sir Lancelot the fon was wont to fay, he had three noble houfes-, one 
for pleafure, Crofby in Weftmorland, where he had a park full of deer; one 
for profit and warmth, wherein to refide in winter, namely, Yanwith nigh 
Penrith â€¢, and the third, Threlkeld, well flocked with tenants to go with him 
to the wars.
He had three daughters coheirs â€¢, one married to Thomas Dudley , with whom 
he had Yanwith ; the other two were married to two brothers, Pickerings, 
younger fons of Sir James Pickering of Killington in Weftmorland.
One of 
thefe two brothers with his wife had Threlkeld ; the other brother, viz.
Ja?ncs t 
had, with Elizabeth the eldeft fifter, Crofby Ravenfworth.
The arms of Threlkeld differed only in colour from thofe of Hajlings ; being, 
Argent, a manch Gules.
, In a feodary of Henry earl of Cumberland, in the 18 Hen. 8.
it appears, 
that James Pickering efquire, as in the right of Elizabeth his wife, one of the 
daughters and coheirs of Lancelot Threlkeld knight, held of the faid earl the 
manor of Crofby Ravynfwath, by the cornage of 13 j yd, owing alfo to the 
faid earl for the fame wardfhip, marriage, relief, and fuit to the county court.

James was fucceeded by his fon William Pickering efquire ; who in the 
23 Hen. 8.
was an arbitrator, together with Thomas Dudley of Yanwith and 
Chriftopher Thrclkeld of Mtlmerby efquires, in a caufe between Guy and 
Hugh Machel of Crackenthorp.
The laid William had a fon Lanceht, who about the ioEliz.
married a 
daughter of Thomas Blenkinfop of .Helbeck efquire.
He appears to have 
been living in the 41 Eliz.
and was fucceeded by his fon and heir, viz.
Thomas Pickering of Crofby efquire ; who in the reign of king James the 
firft fold the manor and part of the demefne to Sir John Lowther of Lowther 
knight.
The arms of Pickering were; Ermine, a lion rampant Azure, crowned Or.
The faid Sir John Lowther gave the faid eftate in marriage with his daughter 
Frances to John Dodfworth of Thornton Watlafs in the county of York efquire.
He was a younger brother of the family of that name there.
He had iffue John 
Dodfworth of Crofby efquire, who died without iffue, having devifed this eftate 
to Mr. Francis Bayly his faithful fervant and fteward, fecond fon of Dr. Bayly 
of Penrith.
Which Francis married Mrs. Mary Purley of Lincolnfhire ; by 
whom he had iffue Margaret Bayly ; which Margaret fold the premifes to Robert 
Lowther of Mauld's Meburn efquire, father of the prefent owner Sir James 
Lowther baronet.
The hall is an ancient tower houfe, near adjoining to the weft end of the 
church, and overfhaded with trees.
Formerly there hath been a moat about 
it.
In the tower, where they enter, are two windows, one above the other, 
of no mean workmanfhip.
Above the door, are the letters I D, for John 
Dodfworth, who repaired the tower, and cut thefe letters in the old work.
There is a coat of arms, quarterly, of eight ; which feems to have been put 
up by the Pickerings.
A little eaftward from the churchyard is the fchool; a neat little building, 
but fupported only by a fmall falary of 7 or 8 / a year, by money out at 
intereft.
The park where Sir Lancelot Threlkeld kept his deer, lies a little fouth- 
ward from the hall and village adjacent, and is now called Crofby Gill.
It was 
fold off from the reft of the demefne, by the laft of the Pickerings, to Ed- 
ward Wilfon of Heverfham hall gentleman; with whofe kinfwoman Jane, daugh- 
ter of Thomas Wilfon, it was given in marriage to Robert Rawlinfon barrifter at 
law, fon of William Rawlinfon of Colton in Lancafliire by his wife Margaret 
daughter of Walter Curwen of Mirefide.
Which faid Robert, by the death of his mother's brother without iffue, inhe- 
rited a fair eftate at Mirefide, Carke, and Cartmell.
By his wife Jane Wilfon, 
he had iffue a fon Curwen Rawlinfon, and four daughters, Anne, Katharine, 
Eleanor, and Jane ; which two laft died without iffue.

Curwen Rawlinfon efquire married Elizabeth only furviving child of Nicolas 
Monk bifhop of Hereford and brother to George Monk firft duke of Albe- 
marle, fon of Sir Thomas Monk of Potheridge in Devonfhire, fon of An- 
thony Monk efquire, fon of Thomas Monk efquire by Frances Plantagenet 
daughter and coheir of Arthur Plantagenet vifcount Liflc, fon of king Edward 
the fourth.
He had ifiue two fons, Monk, and Cbrijlopher : Monk died un- 
married, and the inheritance defcended to his younger brother Chrifiopher.
The faid Chrifiopher Rawlinfon was a gentleman of learning, and well fkilled 
in antiquities.
In the year 1698, being then gentleman commoner of Queen's 
college in Oxford, he publifhed an elegant edition of king Alfred's Saxon 
verfion of Boethius de Confolatione Philojophia.
He made alfo a large collection 
of matters relating to the counties of Lancafter and Weftmorland, particu- 
larly that part which is called the barony of Kendal, from the Efcheators books 
and other evidences : From which, Sir Daniel Fleming extracted fo much as- 
concerns the county of Weftmorland ; which extracts make a part of the va- 
luable collection of manufcripts at Rydal hall.
This Chrifiopher alfo died un- 
married ; and thereby the eftate defcended to the ifiue of Curwen Rawlinfon's 
two fillers Anne and Katherine.
Of whom, Anne was married to Chrifiopher Crackenthorp of Newbigoin 
efquire ; who had ifiue Richard ; who had iffue Mottram, Deborah, and Anne .
Mottram died unmarried ; and thereupon one moiety of Crqfby Gill defcended 
to his faid two fitters : Of whom, Anne was married to Dr. Adam AJkew of 
Newcaftle upon Tyne, who received one half of the faid moiety ; and Debo- 
rah, dying unmarried, devifed her half part of the faid moiety to Dr. Anthony 
AJkew of London, fon and heir of the faid Adam Afkew by his faid wife Anne 
Crackenthorp.
Katherine, the other filler of Curwen Rawlinfon, was married to Roger Moor 
of Middleton ferjeant at law; who had ifiue Roger, Anne, Mary, and Kathe- 
rine.
Of whom, Roger died without ifilie, and his moiety defcended to his 
three fillers ; viz.
Anne, married to William Aylmer vicar of Warton ; Mary, 
married to Charles Blake ; and Katherine (who only had ifiue) married firft to 
Mr. Rigg of Hawkfhead, and afterwards to George Dixon.
And all the 
three fillers, being widows, devifed their (hares refpectively of the faid moiety 
to the faid Katherine's grandchildren, two of whom enjoy the fame at this time, 
viz.
Fletcher Rigg efquire two fhares, and his filler Jane (married to Mr. Ed- 
ward Moore) one fhare.
The park wall hath been about three yards high, as appears by feveral parts 
thereof yet Handing.
And there is a farm hoiife in the middle upon an emi- 
nence, which is yet called The Lodge.
In this park alfo was plenty of black 
game.
Near the head of Crofby Gill, fprings the river Lyvennet, at a place called 
Black-Dub, where king Charles the fecond, when he came in with the Scots 
in the year 1651, relied and dined, and drank of that water.

to Crofby, and parting under Monks bridge near the church, runs down through 
Maud's Me burn, and from thence by King's Meburn, Wood head, Cliburn, 
and Julian Bower in Whinfell park, into the river Eden.
Above the head of Crofby Gill on the eaft fide, nigh the way leading from 
Crofby Ravenfworth, is a remarkable heap of (tones called Penhurrock ; which 
from its name muft needs be ancient.
Pen is Britifh, and fignifies an head or 
fummit; burrock is Saxon, and fignifies an heap of (tones.
And probably it 
hath been a tumulus or burying place in the time of the ancient Britons.
The lordfhip of Birkbeck Fells is in this manor, although the greateft part 
of the faid lordfhip is within the parifh of Orton.
In the reign of king James the firft, there was a difpute (as we have fet 
forth at large in treating of the barony of Kendal) between the lords of ma- 
nors and their tenants, the lords claiming an abfolute eftate in the tenements, 
and the tenants infilling upon an inheritance therein according to the cuftom 
of the manor.
After various litigations, divers lords and their tenants came 
to a compromife.
And particularly in the manor of Crofby Ravenfworth, Sir 
John Lowther of Lowther knight, and John Lowther of Hackthorp efquire 
his ion, by their deed fetting forth, that whereas the tenants claim to be 
feifed of their feveral mefTuages and tenements with the appurtenances, to them 
and their heirs, under certain rents, fines, boon days, works, and other fer- 
vices â€¢, and whereas there have been divers queftions and differences, between 
the faid lords and tenants, touching the validity of their faid cuftomary eftate 
which they claim as aforefaid ; and whereas the faid tenants have agreed to 
pay forty years ancient rent for fettling and confirming their eftate ; they 
therefore confirm to the faid tenants their eftate, to defcend acccording to 
the common law, except that the eldeft daughter or fifter (hall inherit; 
paying only two rents (or a fine: referving neverthelefs the freehold eftate 
therein, and fuit of court, and fuit of mill.
But releafing to the tenants all 
fervices of plowing, harrowing, (hearing, raking, peat leading, farm hens, 
and fait.
Which laft Item was from a demand, after Sir John Lowther had purchafed 
St. Bees and Whitehaven, of the tenants going there once a year and fetching 
fait and other necefiaries to Lowther-, as the Wyberghs of Clifton, when they 
had St. Bees, had required the like boon of their tenants at Clifton.
But in the conclufion, mod of the tenements in this manor have been fold 
to freehold ; the lord referving only the royalties, and fuit of mill after the 
twentieth multure, and power to inclofe 200 acres of the common to be fet 
out by a majority of the tenants ; and the rent of 6d an acre, if the tenants 
lhall agree to inclofe the common.
There are three or four houfes on the eaft fide of the village of Crofby, 
called Bank and Row â€¢, which are within the manor of Garthorne, moft of

III.
MANOR OF MAULD'S MEBURN.
Until Maud de Veteripont^ time, the whole tract, including both the Meburns, 
.and the fpace between called Meburn Field, went by one general name of Me- 
burn.
It was often anciently written Medburn\ which feemeth to indicate, 
that it received this name from the burn or rivulet (of Lyvennet) running all 
along down the middle of the vale.
The faid Maud, who was fifter to Sir Hugh Morvil, being married to "Wil- 
liam de Veteripont as is before mentioned, carried this eftate to her faid huf- 
band in frank marriage ; and after the forfeiture of Sir Hugh Morvil, the 
other part of Meburn being taken into the king's hands, thefe two divifions 
became diftinguifhed by the leveral names of King's Meburn and Maud's Me- 
burn, or Mauld's Meburn (Meburn Matildae).
The faid William de Veteripont gave four oxgangs of land at Meburn to 
the friers of the hofpital of St Peter (otherwife called the hofpital of St. Leo- 
nard) at York : Maud his wife (amongft others) being witnefs to the faid 
grant.
Ivode Veteripont, fon of the faid William and Maud, and brother of Robert, 
gave to the faid hofpital lands at Meburn circumfcribed by thefe limits â€¢, viz.
" From the nether or lower head of Undercot gill, unto the fike which is 
in the upper head, and fo all along by the fame fike fouthwards unto the ditch 
by the highway-fide which leads from Appleby to Tibbay, imd fo nigh unto 
the public way or ftreet weftwards unto the boundary of Crofby, and thence 
unto the boundary of Afkeby, and on to Keldheved, and thence towards the 
eaft between the boundaries of Meburn and Afkeby unto the mills, and unto 
the ground which the faid Ivo had before given to the aforefaid hofpital." 
Robert de Veteripont, fon of Ivo, gave to the abbey of Shap 22 s yearly 
to be paid out of Meburn in the name of alms corn.
â€” After the diffblution of 
the abbey, in a rental of the "Wharton eftates (who had a grant of the pof- 
feffions of the faid abbey) John Fletcher and others, tenants of the demefne 
lands commonly called Meburn hall, ftand charged for alms corn, formerly 
paid to the faid abbey, 26 s 8d 
There were fcveral perfons of the name de Meburn 'in thofe days, but none 
of them lords of the manor.
After the death of Maud, her fon Ivo held Meburn ; which Ivo had a ion 
R'.bert, who in the 27 Hen. 3.
granted this manor to John k Fraunceys ; as ap- 
pears by a record in that year, fetting forth, that Robert de Veteripont fon 
and heir of Ivo de Veteripont, recognized that he had given to John le Fraun- 
ceys 
PARISH OF CROSBY RAVENS WORTH.
(Mauld's Meburn.) 5 o 3 
ceysfon of Hugh le Franceys the whole manor of Meburn which is called Maud's 
Meburn, to hold to him and his heirs, rendring yearly for all fervices one 
pound of cumin.
(This payment was to Ivo: But there were other fervices to 
be performed to the barons of Westmorland, paramount lords of the fee.) 
The faid John le Franceys granted on the other hand, that Johan, daughter 
of the laid Ivo, fhould peaceably have and hold the'feveral lands and tenements 
granted to her by her father, with the fervices of villains and bondmen.
In the 41 Hen. 3.
Philip le Fraunceis had a grant of free warren in Welt- 
morland and Cumberland.
This Philip feems to have had a (on Gilbert-, whofe fon Richard le Franceis 
married a daughter of Sir Michael de Harcla.
For in the 6 Ed. 1.
the kino- 
feifed the lands of Sir Michael de Harcla, until it (ball appear by what right 
and title Richard le Fraunceis fon and heir of Gilbert le Fraunceis married the 
daughter of Sir Michael de Harcla, being then the king's ward.
In the 35 Ed. 1.
John le Fraunceys was a juror on the inquifition poft mortem 
of Margaret de Rofs.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Richard le Fraunces held of the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, 
the manor of Meburn Maud and Whale, by homage and fealty, and the corn- 
age of 33s.
And that the wardfnip thereof, when it fhould happen, was 
worth 4OJ.
In the 15 Ed. 3.
one Ifabella de Vernon held Meburn.
By which there feems 
to be little doubt, but that the family of Fraunceys had ended, in a daughter 
married to Vernon.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Richard Vernon held the manor of Medburn.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
and again in the 10 Hen. 5.
Richard de Vernon held Me- 
burn Mauld and Whale, by the cornage of 33 J.
In the 3 1 Hen. 6.
William Vernon held the fame.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, George Vernon held Meburn Maud and Whale, , 
by the like fervices.
From this time we have no further account till the reign of king James the 
firft ; when in the 12th year of that king, a fettlement was made of this manor 
of Meburn, upon John Lowther of Lowther efquire and Elianor his wife, 
daughter of William Fleming of Rydal efquire.
The ancient manor houfe feems to have been where the hall now frands.

Afterwards he was made under-

MANOR OF R E G I L L.
This place of old time was invariably written Renegill: From what original, 
is not certain.
Perhaps it was from the name of the owner.
Rene was a name 
in the time of William the Conqueror, and long after.
The firft of the an- 
ceftors of king William the third who came to be prince of Orange, was Rene 
â– de Najfau.
The aforefaid Maud de Veteripont gave half a ploughland of her demefne 
in Renegill in frank marriage with her daughter Chriftian to Robert fon of 
Derman : Which land was called Hynthorneham.
Afterwards fhe gave to her fon Robert the whole vill of Renegill; he ren- 
dring to her for all fervices one hawk.
Which he was to hold of Ivo his bro- 
ther.
Ivo confirmed the fame to Robert and his heivs, in the 9th year of 
king John.
And in the 13th year of the fame king, the faid Robert granted to the 
abbey of Shap the whole vill of Renegill with the appurtenances ; which he 
exprefleth as granted to him by Maud his mother, and confirmed by Yvo his 
brother.
After the diflblution, the revenues of the abbey of Shap were granted by 
the crown in the 36 Hen. 8.
to Thomas lord Wharton ; and the particulars of 
Renegill were as follows : â€” Divers rents and fervices ifluing out of the lands 
and tenements of the heirs of William Hilton, the heirs of William Howgill, the 
heirs of John Medburn, and of the wife of Roland Herd/on ; and all mefluages, 
mills, tofts, cottages, lands, tenements, meadows, paftures, and other here- 
ditaments, in the tenure or occupation of Thomas Winter and Richard his 
fon, Henry Bun, John Blamire, John Coljlane, Thomas Furmfs, Roland Furnefs,

The Whartons fold Regill Grange and half of the demefne, to Dr. Lancelot 
Dawes of Bartonkirk; and the other half to Sir John Lowther, who after- 
wards purchafed the whole.
And finally, whatfoever remained in the hands

There was here anciently a chapel or oratory : of which there are fome re-

Here was born Mr. Randall Sander/on, fome time fellow of Queen's college

about 72 families, all of the church of England.
The church is.
dedicated to St. Peter; and is a rectory, valued in the king's 
books at 23/ I3J qd: in the patronage of Walter Fletcher of Hutton in the 
Forefl in the county of Cumberland efquire.
In the reign of king Henry the third, we find one Adam parfon of Afkeby; 
witnefs to a deed of lands there.
In the year 1298, 27 Ed. 1.
one Richard le Englijh was parfon of Afby, 
who in that year gave one mefTuage and fix acres of land in Great Afby, for 
making a chantry in the chapel of St. Leonard of Little Afby.

In the fame year, William de Brampton was prefented to the rectory of Afkeby, 
by Sir Robert de Afkeby knight.
In the year 13 19, on the death of William de Brampton, William de Kelde-

In 1345, on William de Keldefyke's death, Themas de Anant was inftituted, 
on the prefentation of Sir Hugh de Moriceby knight, who married the daugh-

This Thomas de Anant gave 
by his will ioo marks to the town of Newcaftle upon Tyne, and 50 marks to 
the parifh of Afkeby.
In 1374, on the death of Thomas de Anant, Stephen de Meburn was infti-

then in wardfhip of the king.
In 1563, Sir Percival Kirkbryde was inftituted, on a prefentation from Mi- 
chael and John Kirkbryde, who derived their title from the lady Anne Knevet, 
widow of Sir Henry Knevet of Eaft Horfeley in the county of Surrey.
In 1572, on the deprivation of Percival Kirkbryde (probably for not fub- 
fcribing the 39 articles) inftitution was given to John Barnes, prefented by 
John Vaughan of Efkrig in the county of York efquire, and the lady Anne

In 1578, Thomas Fairfax, S.

The church of Afby is an ancient building, with three bells.
There was heretofore a chantry in this church, dedicated to the virgin Mary,

A little below the church eaftward, rifes a large fpring called St. Hellenes

AS BY WINDERWATH.
It feemeth that anciently all the AJkebys (which now make three diflinct 
manors) were one undivided intire manor.
Afterwards, the fame became- 
diftinguiflied into Little AJby and Great AJby. Little /IJby ieems to have been 
originally the principal place â€¢, for in ancient writings we fometimes find it 
ftyled Old AJkeby (AJkeby Fetus).
Great AJkeby became again divided into, 
moieties, AJkeby Wynanderwath and AJkeby Cotesford.
There is a Winanderwath in the parifh of Cliburn, and Winandermere in the 
barony of Kendal.
But from whence any of them derived their name, we* 
have not certainly found â€¢, mod likely, from the name of the owner.
The lords of AJkeby Winanderwath (who alfo were patrons of the advowfon) 
fo far as we are able to go back, were of the name de AJkeby, 
In the reign of king Henry the fecond, William fon of Robert de AJkeby, 
and Gilbert and Adam his brothers, were witnefies to a grant of lands at Bla- 
terne to the abbey of Byland.
In the reign of Richard the firft, Sir Robert de AJkeby knight (probably fon- 
of William) was witnefs to divers inftruments.
The next of the family feems to have been Gilbert.
For in the reign of king 
Henry the third, Robert fon of Gilbert de AJkeby granted to Adam fon of Hugh 1 
de Soureby and Idonea daughter of William de Cotesford (kinfwoman of the 
laid Robert) in frank marriage, four acres of his demefne land of Winander^ 
what, within the vill of Winanderwhat and without, namely, three acres and 
an half in Sulewhatfite, and half an acre nigh the bank which goes down from 
the foreft upon Rokeraithej and granted alfo, that they might grind their corn 
growing on the faid lands at his mill of Winanderwhat moulter free, or carry 
the laid corn to be ground elfewhere without doing fuit to his faid mill.
Wit- 
nefies to the faid grant were (amongft others) Robert de Cotesfurd> Geoffrey* 
de Cotesford, William Englifh, and Adam parfon of Afkeby.
In the 14 Ed. 1.
Robert de AJkeby- held the manor of Great Afkeby of the 
two daughters and coheirs of the laft Robert de Veteripont; 
In the 28 Ed. 1.
Robert fon of Henry de AJkeby founded the chantry of the 
virgin Mary aforefaid in St. Peter's church at Afkeby.
This Robert war* knight of the fhire for Weftmorland in the 30 Ed. i;

Fn the 3 Ed. 2.
on an inquifition of lands in Weftmorland held by cornage, 
it was found, that Robert de AJkeby held a moiety (as it is there exprefTed) of 
Great Aflceby and Winanderwath, and one carucate of land in Winton.
In the 7 Ed. 2.
the faid Robert was again knight of the (hire for Weft- 
morland.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the jurors find, that 
Robert de AJkeby held a moiety of Afkeby Winderwath ; the wardfhip whereof' 
was worth 10/, the cornage 19 s.
In the 12 Ed. 2.
Robert de AJkeby and Margaret his wife granted to Gilbert 
fon of Richard Engayne of Clifton, a toft and croft and all their land at Clif- 
ton, to hold during his life of Margaret de AJkeby their daughter, by the rent 
of a rofe on the nativity of St. John Baptift.
This Margaret de AJkeby was their only child ; who carried the inheritance 
by marriage to Sir Hugh de Morejby knight â€¢, who in the 2 Ed- 3.
and again in' 
the 10 Ed. 3.
was knight of the fhire for Weftmorland.
In the 11 Ed. 3.
there was a grant of free warren to Hugh de Morejby in 
Winanderwath and Afkeby.
In the 16 Ed. 3.
a fine was levied between Hugh de Morejby and Margaret his 
wife complainants, and Robert de AJkeby deforciant, of the manor of Wynan-*- 
derwath and of a moiety of the manor of Rookby â€¢, to hold to the faid Robert 
for life r remainder to the faid Hugh and Margaret and the heirs of their bodies, 
remainder to the right heirs of the faid Robert in fee.
Two years after this, the faid Hugh appears to be dead ; for in the r 8 Ed. 3.
a fine was levied of the manor of Great Afkeby, between Chrijiopher de Mo- 
rijby and Ifabel his wife of the one part, and Margaret wife of Hugh Morijby 
of the other part; to hold to the faid Chriftopher and Ifabel and the heirs of 
their bodies, remainder to the heirs of the faid Margaret in fee.
In the 28 Ed. 3.
amongft the efcheats in Cumberland, it is found, tfiar 
Chriftopher Moriceby held a moiety of the manor of Diftington, and the manor 
of Moriceby in Cumberland, and the manor of Afkeby in Weftmorland.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Chriftopher Morejby held of Robert deClifford the manor of 1 
Afkeby Wynanderwath.
In the 47 Ed. 3.
the king prefented a clerk to the re&ory of Afkeby as 
aforefaid, in right of the heir of Chriftopher de Moriceby -then in ward' to the 
king.
This heir was a daughter Anne, married to Sir James Pickeringof Killington 
knight.
Which Anne, by a rental of Henry earl of Cumberland in the- 
18 Hen. 8.
appears to have then held a moiety of Afkeby called Wynander- 
wath, and one carucate of land in Wynton.
This Anne, to her hufband Sir James Pickering, had a fon and heir Sir 
Chriftopher Pickering, who had an only child Anne; which Anne was thrice 
married, firft to Sir Francis Wejiby, fecondly to Sir Henry Knevett, and thirdly 
to John Vaughan efquire.
In the 6 Eliz.
there was a pretention to the rectory of Afby (as is above 
mentioned) by virtue of a title derived from the lady Anne Knevet, widow of 
Sir Henry Knevet.
And

And in the 15EI1Z.
there was a prefentation to the faid rectory., by John 
Vaughan efquire and the lady Anne his wife.
Six years after this, we find the advowfon in the hands of Lancelot Pickerim 
efquire, of the family of that name at Crofby Ravenfworth and Garthorne; 
fo that he feemeth to have purchafed the manor, with the advowfon appendent.
And Sir Richard Fletcher of Hutton (in whofe family it dill continues) pur- 
chafed the fame of the Pickerings.
III.
ASBY COTESFORD.
This had its name of diftinction evidently from the owner.
At the fame time that William de AJkeby was witnefs to divers inflruments, 
fo alfo was Richard de Cottesford, in the reign of king Henry the fecond.
In the firfl year of king John, Gilbert Fitz-Reinfred, IherifF of Weflrnor- 
land, accounted in the exchequer for 3/ paid by Hugh de Cottesfurth for lands 
in Afby after the death of his uncle.
In the 14 Ed. 1.
Peter de Cotesford held Afkeby Cotesford of the two daugh- 
ters of Robert de Veteripont.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
John de Cottesford held a moiety of Great Afkeby â€¢, the ward- 
fhip whereof was worth by the year 61 13 s \d\ the cornage 4s 2d.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
John de Cotesforth held the manor of Afkeby Cotesforth.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
Stephen de Cotesford held the fame.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
John de Cotesford held a moiety of Afkeby called Afkeby 
Cotesford, by homage and fealty, and 4s 2d cornage ; owing alfo for the fame, 
wardfhip, marriage, and relief.
In the 4 Ed. 4.
John de Cotesford was one of the jurors on the inquifition 
â– pofi mortem of John de Clifford; and this is the laft of the name that we have 
met with.
This manor came afterwards to the Mufgraves, and paffed with a daughter 
and heir to Dr. Bouchier^ who fold the fame to the prefent owner Roger Pindar 
gentleman.
There are two eftates in this parifh which go by the name of Grange ; cne 
of them went along with the manor of Afby Cotesford ; the other belonged 
to the abbey of Byland in Yorkfhire, but by whom it was given we have not 
found.

To a deed of lands at Crackenthorp, in the reign of king Henry the fecond, 
three of the witnefTes are, William de Afkeby, Richard de Cotesford, and Richard 
Englifh [L'Engleysj : who were feverally lords of the three Afkebys.
In the 4th year of king John, there was an agreement between Robert lc 
Scot and Richard le Engleys, concerning half a carucate of land, with the ap- 
purtenances, in Old Afkeby.
In 
PARISH OF ASBY.
In the 13th year of the fame king, William Englifh was witnefs to a grant 
Â©f Robert de Veteripont to Shap Abbey.
In the 20 Ed. 1.
Sir Robert le Engleys was a juror at Appleby in a caufe be- 
tween the king and the abbot of St. Mary's York.
In the 2d, 4th, and 5th of Ed 2.
Robert V Angleys knight reprefented the 
county of Weftmorland in parliament.
In the 2 Ed. 3, William UEngliJhe and Elena his wife levied a fine of the 
manor of Little Afby and lands in Great Afby, to the ufe of the faid William 
and Elena and the heirs of their bodies, remainder to Robert brother of the faid 
William and the heirs of his body, remainder to Thomas another brother, re- 
mainder to John Dawney and the heirs of his body, remainder to the right 
heirs of the faid William.
In the 12 Ed 3.
there was a grant to William Englijhe to impark 100 acres of 
land in Kirklevington in the county of Cumberland, 100 acres elfewhere in 
the faid county, 100 acres at Tibbay and Runthwaite in the county of Weftmor- 
land, and 100 acres at AfTmudeby in the county of York.
In the 15 Ed. 3.
a fine was pafTed of the manors of Tybbay and Runthwaite, 
to the ufe of William UEngliJhe knight for life, remainder to William his fon.
and the heirs male of his body, remainder to Julian his filler.
In moft of the parliaments from the 12 Ed. 2.
to the 22 Ed. 3.
William 
Lengleys was knight of the fhire for Weftmorland.
In the 34 Ed. 3.
John fon of Robert V Engleys made a fettlement of his eftate 
at Little Afby ; Henry de Sandford, parfon of Croiby Gerard, being a truftee 
in that fettlement.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
on an inquifition of knights fees in Weftmorland, it was 
found, that Robert Lenngkys then held Little Afby.
The faid Robert had a fon Thomas Englijh knight, who died before his father, 
and was the laft of the name at Little Afby.
He had ifTue only a daughter, 
viz.
Idonea Englijh, who was married to Edmund de Sandford, a younger brother 
of Sir William Sandford of Sandford in the parifh of Warcop knight.
The faid family of Englijh had confiderable pofieffions in the parifh of Afk- 
ham.
And Idonea removed with her hufband to Afkham ; and they were the 
founders of the family of Sandford both at Afkham and Howgill.
She mar- 
ried to her fecond hufband Sir Thomas Ughtred : And in the 15 Rio 2.
we find, 
that Thomas Ughtred and Tdonia his wife, as of the right of the faid Tdonia, 
held the manor of Little Aikeby, by homage and fealty and the cornage of 
2s tod.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Robert de Sandeford held the fame.
Which Robert feems to have been fe- 
cond fon of the faid Edmund and Idonea, his elder brother William having died 
without ifTue. For by an inquifition of the fervices of knights and others, 
free tenants, holding of Thomas de Clifford as of his barony of Weftmorland,

elder brother of Rober t Sandford efquire, which Margaret had the fame vill in 
jointure with the aforefaid William her late hufband, the reverfion thereof be- 
Jonging to the faid Robert.
Soon after this, we find Thomas Sandford (fon of the faid Robert) holding 
the fame by the like fervices.
In the 1 8 Hen. 8.
Thomas Sandford of Afkham efquire held the fame.
Which 
Thomas had two fons â€¢, Thomas, the elder, who continued at Afkham ; and 
Richard, the younger, who had Howgill; unto which younger branch acceded 
alfo little Afby, and continued in the Sandfords of Howgill till failure of ifiue 
male, when the fame was transferred by marriage of Mary daughter and heir 
.of Sir Richard Sandford of Howgill baronet to Robert Honywood of Mark's hall 
m Effex efquire; whofe fon, lieutenant general Philip Honeywood, now enjoys 
the fame.
At Little Afby was a chapel, dedicated to St. Leonard; unto which Richard 
le Engli/h, parfon of Afby as aforefaid, gave a mefiuage and 6 acres of land 
for the eftablifhing a chantry therein.
In digging of peats within this manor, nigh the Eaft end of* Sunbiggin tarn, 
about 40 years ago, were found the horns of two large bulls, jumped together 
in.the pofture of fighting; one of them probably having pufhed the other 
into the mud, where they had both funk.
The reft of the fkeletons could not

^vRmside is a corruption (as molt of the names of places and perfons have 
^-^ been corrupted in ignorant times) of Ormes-head, or (which is the fame) 
Ormefheved: And had its name probably from fome owner of the name of 
Orme.
Orme, governor of Appleby caftle (father of Cofpatric), who lived in 
the reign of king Henry the fecond, we have often had occafion to mention.
That this place had its name from him, we cannot affirm : but rather it feems 
to have been from fome other of the name before that time.

The church of Ormfide, as alfo the parifh, is but fmall.
It ftands near unto

It hath a tower fteeple, with two little bells.
There is an ile on 
the north fide belonging to the lord of the manor.
In the manor of Ormfide there are two hamlets or villages, diftinguifhed 
by the names of Great Ormfide and Little Ormfide, perhaps after Little Ormfide 
was parted from the reft of the manor.
Great Ormside is pleafantly fituate, on the fouth fide of the river Eden ; 
and contains about 20 families.
The firft perfon of note that we have found with certainty at Ormfide, was 
in the reign of king John, namely, John de Ormefheved ; who, together with 
Robert de Boell, in the 4th year of the faid king, was appointed to receive 
pofTeffion of Appleby caftle, in behalf of Robert de Veteripont, to whom the 
king then firft granted the fame during his pleafure.
The writ for delivery 
thereof was thus : " The king, &c.

There is a well that fprings under the

In the year 1689, behind the church in the river Eden, on the fouth fide

The manor, with the advowfon appendent, was granted by Torphin fon of 
Robert, fon of Copfus, to the priory of Watton of the order of Sempringham 
in Yorkfhire.
Which Torphin fon of Robert feems to be the fame perfon 
who gave the manor of Blaterne to the abbey of Byland, and who lived in the 
reign of king Henry the fecond.
But the church was not appropriated to the 
faid priory of Watton till the year 1336, Gilbert de Wiggeton the rector then 
refigning *.
The tenor of Torphin's grant is fet forth in an account given to the reverend 
Thomas Machel, by Mr. Anthony Prockter curate of Ravenftondale and Mr.
George Fothergill of Tarnhoufe ; as alfo in a manufcript written in the year 
1645, by Anthony Fothergill of Trannahill, great grandfather of the late 
Mr. Anthony Fothergill of Brounber, whole account was taken from an office 
copy of the charter of donation remaining amongft the evidences in the tower 
or palace of the late abbey of St. Mary without the walls of York â€¢, which 
tower was blown up with gunpowder by Oliver Cromwell in the year 1644, 
and this with many other valuable charters belonging to the religious houles 
was thereby deftroyed and loft.
The faid charter was (in Englifh) as follows: 
** Know all men prefent and to come, that I Torphin fon of Robert fon of 
" Copfus have given, and by this my charter confirmed, to God and the 
" blefTed virgin and all the holy men ferving God in the monaftery of Wat- 
vt ton, all the whole vill of Ravenftandale, with that part of the vill called 
c< Newbiggin, with the boundaries and limits thereof as well without the vill 
" as within-, that i-s to fay, from the head of Beverfdale, as the water of 
** Beverfdale runs till it comes into the water of Tebey â€¢, and from thence 
" by Hanfcus to the Blea Tarn â€¢, and from thence into Rafett â€¢, and fo to 
" Couling ftones â€¢, and from Couling {tones to Skeat beck runs into Smerdale 
" beck ; and fo by Smerdale beck till it comes to Smerdale Flatt ; and from 
" thence till it come to the higheft place on Afhfell ; and fo to Tarnwaih 
'-' hole; and from.
Tarn wath hole, as Kirkby way goes, till it come at Scan- 
*' dal water; and fo going up that water into a path-way that goes to Mal- 
" lerftang fcarth ; and then on the top of Wildboar fell to the head of the 
" water of Ulnedale ; and as the water of Ulnedale runs till it come into the 
" water of Rothay; and as the water of Rothay runs till it come betwixt 
** Wafhingham and Keldon ; and from thence to the head of Beverfdale." 
Newbiggin being particularly mentioned in this grant (which is a part of 
Ravenftondale) feems to have been in refpect of a chapel which anciently ftood 
there, at the north end of the village ; which chapel probably was dedicated 
to St Helen, there being a fpring near the fame called St. Helen's well.
This order of Sempringham, unto which the priory of Watton belonged, 
was founded by St. Gilbert at a place of that name in Lincolnfhire, in the year 
1 148.
They had very large privileges granted to them by feveral popes and 
kings of this realm.
Pope Celeftine the third, who came to the fee in 1191, granted to them a 
privilege of exemption from payment of tithes of lands which they had in 
* Toad.

their own cultivation, which being reftrained by the general council of Late- 
ran in the year 1215 to the tithes of fuch lands as they were in poffeffion of 
before the faid council, and divers fpiritual judges refufing to admit their ex- 
emption, pope Honorius the third directed a fpecial commi'ljon to the abbots 
of Kirkftede, ReveQey, and Barlinges, to inforce by fpiritual ccnfurrs the faid 
privilege of exemption, modified by the decrees of the faid general council, 
that is, of fuch lands as they were in poffefilon of before the faid council, but 
not of lands acquired or to be acquired after the faid council.
And king Henry the third, in the year 1225, being the eleventh year of his 
reign, reciting the privileges that had been confirmed to the faid order by his 
father king John, extends the fame to other houfes of that order then newly 
eftablilhed ; and grants as follows :

Wherefore we will and firmly

44 us or our heirs, or before our juftices itinerant." And he extends the 
faid privileges to three houfes of that order then newly founded (that is, after 
the grant of king John's charter above referred to).
King Edward the third, by his charter in the 4th year of his reign, reciting 
the charter of king Henry the third verbatim, confirms all the aforefaid privi- 
leges, and further grants them a freedom from pannage and murage ; extend- 
ing the fame to another houfe of that order then newly founded, called the 
houfe of St. Edmund of Cantebrigg.

By this it appeareth, that belides freedom from toll and other perfonal

by the crown ; and the priory was intitled to the goods of the felons at- 
tainted.
In purfuance of thefe grants, the aforefaid manufcript of Anthony Fother- 
gill lets forth, that if a murderer fled to the church or fjncluary, and tolled 
the holy bell (as it was called), he was free; and that if aftranger came with- 
in the precincts of the manor, he was fafe from the purfuer.
And he adds, 
11 Of our own knowledge, and within our own memory, no felon (though a 
" murderer) was to be carried out of the parifh for trial.
And one Holme, 
" a murderer, lived and died in Ravenftondale ; whofe pofterity continued for 
" two generations, and then the family became extinct." And to this day 
there is a place within the lord's park, in fight of the ancient highway lead- 
ing from Kirkby Stephen to Kendal, called by the name of Gallow-hill.
Amercements for bloodfhed and other crimes not being felony were very 
frequent not many years ago, and the jurisdiction with regard to thefe of- 
fences undoubtedly (till continues, for no a<ft of parliament hath taken it from 
them.
The privilege of fanctuary was abolifhed in this as in all other places 
by act of parliament in the reign of king James the firft, and many other of 
the aforefaid privileges have been taken away by other acts of parliament, 
others have been loft perhaps by difufe, and others have become obfolete by 
the alteration of circumftances.
The lord of the manor hath (till the jurifdicYion of probate of wills and 
granting letters of adminiftration ; which privilege is not mentioned in any of 
the aforefaid ancient grants, being of prior origin to the inftitution of the 
order of Sempringham.
The jurifdiclion of wills and adminiftrations anciently 
belonged to the county court; in which court all caufes of ecclefiaftical as well 
as of temporal cognizance (not being criminal) were determined.
Out of the 
county court, were derived the courts baron; and with thefe the jurifdiclion 
of wills and adminiftrations was transferred to many of the lords of manors ; 
and their claim hath been more efpecially favoured, where the manor belonged 
to any of the religious focieties.
In this manor the fteward of the lord's court alfo administers the oath of 
office to the churchwardens of the parifh ; but offences of ecclefiaftical cog- 
nizance are inquirable only by the ordinary of the diocefe.
And in all other 
refpe6ts, as in granting licences of marriage, ordering and difpofing matters 
relating to the church, accounts of the churchwardens, and other particulars 
of ecclefiaftical inquiry, this parifh hath no peculiar exemption from the epif- 
copal jurifdiclion '*.

The aforefaid king Henry the third, in the 36th year of his reign, granted 
to the monks of Watton a privilege of free warren in Watton and Scancton 
in the county of York, and in Ravenftondale and Langdale in the county of 
Weftmorland.
In the 14 Hen. 8.
a Quo warranto was iffued againft the prior of Watton, 
to fhew why he claimed to have divers liberties in the manor of Ravenftandaie 
and feveral other manors *.
And in the 27th year of the fame king, John Kite bifhop of Carlide cited 
ex officio the prior and convent of Watton, to fhew their title to the church of 
Ravenftandaie â€¢, who, having made proof thereof, were difcharged by the 
bifhop from the faid fuit -f.
After the diffolution of the monaftery, king Henry the eighth granted the 
faid church and manor to the archbifhop of York during his life â€¢, and in the 
38th year of his reign, Nov. 5.
he granted the reverfion thereof to Sir Tho- 
mas Wharton knight, lord Wharton; amounting, over and above certain re- 
prifes allowed in the particulars, to 93/ us 8 d yearly.
For which, the faid lord 
Wharton was to pay 935/ 16s 8d> being ten years purchafe, at three different 
payments, the firft payment of 235/ \6s 8d to be at the nativity of St. John 
Baptift next, 350/ at Chriftmafs then next following, and 350/ at the next 
Chriftmafs after J; 
And by a rental of the particulars, it appears, that the park and demefne 
there were rated at 100/ a year; and the rectory (including the profits of 
" fay; between the crofs which is on the bank of Eden towards Cork by, and the crofs which is 
" by the chapel of St. Ofwald on the fide of the water of Eden next to Corkeby ; and between the 
" crofs which ftands nigh the Loge upon the bank of the aforefaid water, and the crofs which 
" ftands nigh the fike of Waryewyke, and the crofs which ftands between the vill of Scotteby and 
" the Grange of the prior of Wederhale ; and fo by that rivulet 10 the crofs which Hands upon the 
" bank of theafore(aid rivulet nigh Cumquityn ; and fo from the aforefaid crofs to the boundaries 
*' of the prior of Wederhale and the vill of Cumquityn upon Lytiltwaite; and fo from Lytiltwait 
" unto Lencraike, which is upon the bank of the water of Eden ; and fo unto Wederhale, and to 
" the aforefaid crofs on the bank of Corkeby nigh the faid grange of the prior." The cafe was, 
one Richard Gcner (with two other perfons) coming nigh unto the houfe of Roger fon of Martin, 
and finking his dog, the faid Roger came out of the houfe with a fÂ«o:d in his hand, and therewith 
ftruck the faid Richard under the navel up to his heart, fb that he inftantly died of the wound.
Upon this, the murderer fled to the liberty of the prior of Wederhale, and flayed there from 
Candlemafs until Michaclmafs, and upon the king's coming into thefe parts he fled in:o Scthnd.
And the abbot being called, came by his attorney, and pleaded that the aforefaid Roger came into 
his faid liberty after the felony was committed, and tolled a certain bell in the church, and fwcue 
before the bailiffs of the liberty that for the future he would demean himfclf well and faith- 
fully, fo was admitted to flay there as long as he pleafed, fo that he went not out of the bounds 
of the faid liberty; and that he and his predecelTors had ufed that cuflom in the faid liberty time 
out of mind.
Which thing being put upon inqueft, the jurors find, that the faid abbot and.
his predeceffors had ufed the faid cuftom which the faid abbot claimed time out of mind, and with- 
out interruption.
It was therefore granted, that the faid abbot go without day; faving the kino's 
right, if he fhall conteft the fame at any other time.
â€” But in another plea, concerning the leception 
of William Provofl of Wederhale and Matthew Symundtham, who killed Robert Schawel of Great 
Corkeby in the night-time in the fifhery of Wederhale within the liberty aforefaid, the abbot de- 
clared, that he did not claim any refuge there for felons committing felony within the faid liberty, 
but only for thofe who came for refuge for felony committed out of the faid liberty.

The laid rectory and manor continued in the family of Wharton till the late 
duke of Wharton's time, when the fame were fold, together with the other 
Wharton eltates in Weitmorland, to Robert Lowrher elquire father of the 
prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet : Except the great and fmall tithes 
and ob.'ations within this parifh ; which were fold to the inhabitants and land- 
owners.
For none of thefe tidies or other dues were ever fet out for the ufe 
of a vicar, but the cure was fupplied occafionally by regulars fent out from 
the m onaftery ; and the church continues to this day, not a vicarage, but only 
a perpetual curacy.
To the curate there belongs a fmall thatched dwelling-houfe, with other like 
outhoufing ; and a garth and garden adjoining: The fame being a mefTuage 
and tenement which heretofore belonged to one William Robinfon fchool- 
mafter of Ravenftondale, and on his dying without a will, efcheated to the 
lord.
Whereupon Philip lord Wharton gave the fame for the ufe of the cu- 
rate.
To the faid curate alfo belong two clofes called Haber and Muffel- 
gill, given by one Hodgfon â€¢, one parcel of ground adjoining to the backfide 
of the church, called the Orchard, given by the aforefaid Anthony Fothergill 
of Trannahill, and one Boveli and others in Ravenftondale.
Half an acre of 
land, given by William Chamberlain of Waingarth.
The whole glebe and

The ancient falary paid out of the

The reverend William Morland of Winton (fometime 
rector of Grayftock) gave to this church 100/, for which 5/ intereft was to

There is

intereft whereof to be given for a fermon to be preached yearly on St. Bar- 
tholomew's day.
The whole revenue of the church (including furplice fees) 
is now worth about 35/ a year.
The church was rebuilt in the year 1744, in an elegant manner.
It hath a

In the old church there were two rows 
of feats below the communion table, where (it is faid) the fteward and jury 
of the manor fate formerly, in their court of judicature.
And the malefactors 
were imprifo.ied in a hollow arched vault, the ruins whereof are ftill to be feen,

There is alfo an handfome difienting meeting houfe at Ravenftondale; for the 
fupport of which, Philip lord Wharton gave by his will the fum of 100/, to

thereof to go for the benefit of Mr. Timothy Punchen the then diffenting mi- 
nifter and his fucceffors for ever : And the fame to be laid out in a purchafe of 
hinds as foon as might be convenient: Accordingly, in the year 1693, the 
fame was laid out on a mortgage in Ravenftondale, with a declaration of truft 
that the fame fl.ould enure for the benefit of the minifter, and the mortgage 
to be rentwed every three years according to the cuftom of the faid manor.
Befides this, one Mr. Pindar, a diffenting minifter at London, gave to the

hath been loft, and the reft is let out at intereft by the truftees.
The reft of 
the falary is raifed by voluntary fubferiptions.
And the whole revenue of the

In the old church there was a fmall bell, called the Saint's bell, which W2S 
wont to be rung af'er the N:cene creed, to call in the diffenters to the fermon.
And to this day the diffenters, befides frequenting the meeting houfe, often- 
times attend the ftrmon at church.
There w,ts here alfo a fchool, endowed about the year 1668, by Thomas 
Fothergill, B.
D. mafter of St John's college in Cambridge (who was born 
at Brounber in this parifb) and others of his name and kindred.
In the year 
1758, a very good new fchool- houfe was built by the inhabitants and other 
contributors.
Adjoining to the er.fi: end whereof was erected alfo a commo- 
dious dwelling houfe for the mafter; towards which, the reverend George 
Fothergill, D.
D. principal of Edmund hall in Oxford, gave 10/j the reve- 
rend Thomas Fothergill, D.
D. provoft of Queen's college in the faid uni- 
verfity, gave 20/; and the reverend Henry Fothergill, M.
A. rector of Che- 
riton Bifhop in Devonfhire, gave 10/; all three brothers, born at Lockholme 
in this parifh.
Towards the maintenance of a fcho: lmafter, the aforefaid 
Philip lord Wharton gave a rent charge of 5/ yearly out of his ellate at Raine 
in the parifh of Onon.
'1 here was alfo a large fchool ftock given by the 
founders of the fchool and others.
With 140/ of which ftock, a parcel of 
ground was purchafed at Blaterne, called Florngill, containing 84 acres, now 
worth about 20/ a year, which in the year 170; the truftees imprudently (and 
perhaps illegally enough) fold to Thomas Pattenfon of Breeks gentleman,, and 
accepted for the fame a rent charge of 6 / a year iffuing out of the faid Horn- 
gill and inclofure called Crowhill.
Another eftate was purchafed at Foxell R igg 
in the parifh of Sedbergh for 112/; which the truftees in like manner con- 
verted into an annuity of 5/ a year.
Another eftate at Bousfield in the par;fh 
of Orton was purchafed for 195/, now let for 12/ a year; which alfo, not 
many years ago, narrowly efcaped being converted into a rent charge or an- 
nuity ; notwithstanding that, befides other illegalities, there is a fpecial claufe 
in the deed of fettlement, that the truftees fhall apply the rents and profits of 
the faid eftates for the ufe of the fchoolmafter, and fhall not make any leafe 
thereof for a longer term than 2 1 years.

fums in procefs of time extremely inadequate.
â€” The whole revenue of the 
fchool at prefent amounts to about 30/ a year.
The parifh confifts of four Angles (as they are called), but it is all one ma- 
nor and conftablewick.
It is lo long fince the manor was given away to the 
priory, that there is no tradition remaining, where the ancient manor houfe 
hood.
There is a pretty large park, lying north from the church, the wall 
whereof appears to have been about ten feet in height; but there is no re- 
membrance of any deer having been kept there.
It was walled about by 
Philip lord Wharton in the year 1660 â€¢, the fum total of the expence thereof 
being 128/ 16s, befides love-boons, that is, the voluntary labour of the inha- 
bitants of the neighbouring townfhips, who went to get and to lead (tones for 
the work.
[From which kind of iervices molt, of the boons in the feveral 
manors probably had their original.
And if there had been a park wall to be 
erected every year, it is not unlikely that a cuftom might have obtained of 
boon quarrying and leading (tones.] 
In the cuftoms of this manor, betwixt lord and tenant, there is much re- 
maining of the ancient military eftablifhment.
In order to afcertain thefe 
cuftoms, it was agreed upon between Thomas lord Wharton the firft purchafer 
and the tenants as followeth : 
" Articles of the cuftomary tenant-right of the whole lordfhip and parifh 
of Ravenftondale in the county of Weftmorland, which have been accuitomed 
and ufed within the laid lordfhip time out of man's memory.
All which ar- 
ticles and cu'tomary tenant-righr, I the lord Wharton, lord warden of the 
Eaft and Middle marches of England for anenft Scotland, and captain of the 
king and queen's majefties town and caftle of Berwick, am well contented and 
pleated withal.
In witnefs whereof I have fubfcribed my hand the 6th day of 
October in the 3d and 4th years of our fovereign lord and lady king Philip 
2nd queen Mary.
Firft, It hath been and is accuftomed within the faid lordfhip, that at the 
exchange or entrance of any tenant, he pay unto the lord as much fine or 
grafiom, as the whole year rent of the fame tenement extendeth unto, and 
not above.
Item, It hath been accuftomed within the fame lordfhip, that all manner of 
felonies, murders, forfeitures, petty michers, and all other trefpaffes commit- 
ted and done within the precinct of the faid lordlhip's liberties of Ravenfton- 
dale, either by any of the inhabitants, or by any other foreign perfons, be 
inquired upon by an indifferent jury taken and appointed by the lord or his.
officers within the lordfhip in that behalf.
Item, It hath been and is accuftomed within the faid lordfhip, that for all 
manner of contentions, variances, debates, demands, titles, claims, or tenant- 
right farm-holds, which have been, is, or fhall be depending in controverfy, 
between tenant and tenant, party and party, within the faid lordfhip, be fully 
ordered, determined, and ended, by an indifferent jury and inqueft taken and

nppointed by the lord or his officers there, by the affents and confents of the 
faid parties within the faid lordfhip in that behalf.
Item, It hath been and is accuftomed, that none of the tenants or other 
perfons fhall improve, inclofe, or take up any of the common pafture there, 
without licence of the lord and appointment of the jury taken and eledt in 
that behalf.
Item, It is ordered and agreed, between the lord of the fame lordfhip and 
the tenants there, that from henceforth they fhall break or divide nu farm- 
holds.
Item, It hath been and is accuftomed, that fuch a fon as the father (hall ap- 
point, being able to ferve the king and the lord, fhall be fet tenant of his 
father's tenement, before his death or after, agreeing with the lord after the 
cuftom there.
Item, It hath been and is accuftomed within the faid lordfhip, that if the 
tenant have no fon but daughters, fuch a daughter as the father fhall appoint, 
ufing herfelf honeftly before the day of her marriage, fhall have his tenement, 
agreeing with the lord after the cuftom there.
Item, It hath been and is accuftomed, that where any tenant dieth without 
ifiueof his body lawfully begotten, it fhall be lawful to the faid tenant tbafiign 
or appoint his tenantright of the fame tenement, to whom as fhall pleafe him, 
agreeing with the lord as appertaineth thereto in that refpeel:." 
The cuftoms of the manor were further explained by indenture between 
Philip lord Wharton and the tenants, Feb. 12.
in the 22 Eliz, as followeth : 
tc Imprimis, It is declared and agreed, that it hath been and is accuftomed 
within the faid manor, time whereof the memory of man is not to the con- 
trary, that all the tenants which hold lands or tenements of the faid manor, 
of ancient time by the laudable cuftom of tenantright, havepofTefted and en- 
joyed the fame to them, their heirs and afligns ; paying at the change of every 
lord, and at the change of every tenant, one year's rent for a fine, and not 
above, befides the rent which they pay to the lord : The fine to be paid ac- 
cording to the rent, and not according to the value as the fame be let.
Item, That the late improved grounds fhall pay, at the change of lord and 
tenant, eight years rent, befides the yearly rent, according to the rent they 
pay for the faid new improved grounds.
And the tenants to pay their fines 
on the change cf the lord and tenant, as well for the old, as for the new, up- 
on their admittances.
Item, That every perfon to whom any alienation of any of the faid Tene- 
ments fhall be made, fhall, at the court of the manor next following the faid 
alienation, by himfelf or fome other, give notice and knowledge thereof in 
the laid court to him who fhall keep the faid court; and then fhall take 
order there for the payment of his fine, according to the rate before ex- 
preffed.
Item, That none of the tenants fhall divide or fever their ancient and cuf- 
tomary tenements, or the laid new improvements, or any part of them, upon 
pain of forfeiture; unlefs they do firft agree with the lord or fteward or fome 
other

other having authority from the faid lord fo to do.
In which agreement, it 
fhall not be lawful for the lord to augment or increafe any rent, either of the 
ancient cuftomary tenements or of the new improvements, that fhall be fo 
divided-, but fhall divide the rents proportionably, according to the value of 
the land fo divided.
And this fhall not be expounded or taken to be a change 
of a tenant, fo as the lord fhall have any fine in that refpecT: for the portion 
fo divided.
Item, That if any tenant fhall die without ifTue of his body lawfully begotten, 
not having in his life by his will in writing, or otherwile by any lawful act 
done in the prefence of four of the tenants of the faid manor at the lead, 
aliened or bellowed the fame ; what lands fuch tenants fhall die feifed of fhall 
eicheat to the lord, as if fuch tenant had been dead without heir general or 
ipecial.
It is neverthelefs declared and agreed, that any of the tenants, having no 
ifTue of his body lawfully begotten, and being of the age of fixteen years, 
may by his lad will in writing, or by any other lawful act done in the prefence 
of four of the tenants of the faid manor, give and bequeath his tenement to 
whom he will; the party to whom it fhall be fo given, paying upon his admit- 
tance 20 years rent for a fine, and not above: and the lord fhall not refufe to 
admit him, fo that he be an able man to ferve, and not notoriously known to 
be an enemy to the faid lord.
Provided, that a leafe or demife of the manor, or of any tenement, for fe- 
ven years or under, fhall not be deemed any change of the lord or tenant, 
whereby any fine fhall be due-, yet any tenant may let his tenement for 21 
years in pofTeflion and not above, the leffee to whom the fame fhall be let for 
2 1 years or under, and above 7 years, paying to the lord a fine as for change 
of tenant, and giving knowledge of fuch leafe at the next court *." 
By reafon of the aforefaid provifion for keeping the tenements intire, the 
ancient military eflate continues in many places in a great meafure ftill un- 
altered.
And by this means, there was a fufficiency kept up for the mainte- 
nance and fupport of the foldier ; and the children, except the eldeft, migrated 
into other places.
And fo late as the time of bifhop Nicolfon's parochial vi- 
fitation in 1703, he was informed at Ravenftondale by the churchwardens, that 
they had not had a beggar in the parifh within the memory of man ; and at the 
* In Furrsefs in the county of Lancafter, we find the like cufloms declared and agreed upon in 
the reign of queen Elizabeth; amongft which are the following particulars: â€” " Item, That no 
" perfbn within this lordfhip make any fray, on pain of 6 / %d; nor blood ftroke, on pain of 
" 3 j 4^; nor fhall unlawfully chide, on pain of is; nor make tuxhill or hubblefhowe, on pain 
" of \ s ; nor fold breake, on pain of $s $.d. Item, That no perfon flander any juryman, nor any 
" that giweth evidence to a jury, nor call any perfon thief or peijured, or any woman whore, 
" except they will juftify and make proof thereof on pain of bs id.
Item, Whereas dividing, 
" parcelling, and portioning of ancient tenements hath been a great decay and impoverifhment of 
" the lord, and chiefly in hindering of the fervice of her h^ghnels for horfes, and to trve fpoil and 
" wafting of her majefty's woods, and occafion of making a great number of poor people within 
â€¢â€¢ the krdfhip to the impoverifhment of her highnefs's tenants ; it is declared and agreed, that 
" none fhall aliene any parcel of his tenement, but intirely, arid not by parcels, otherwife the bar- 
s' gain to be utterly void of every parcel fo fold."

only the curate and fchoolmajier.
And this happy equality in a great meafure dill continues.
The moft con- 
fiderable family feems to have been that of Fothergill ; which at prefent is very 
numerous.
In the reign of king Henry the eighth, at the famous rencounter at Sollom 
Mofs, Sir William Fothergill of Ravenftondale was ftandardbearer to Sir Tho- 
mas Wharton.
His arms were â€¢, Vert, a {lag's head couped, within a bordure

In the reign of king Charles the fecond, George Fothergill of Tarn-houfe 
efquire (before mentioned) was clerk of the peace for the county of Weft- 
morland.
Which houfe was then the only flated houfe in this parifh ; whereas 
now, fince the elegant covering of blue flate was difcovered, moft of the houfes 
in Ravenftondale are ornamented with that cover.
The aforefaid arms are over 
the door at Tarn-houfe.
In the old church, at the Eaft end of the South ile 
were two monuments, with the following epitaphs :

Thomas Fothergill aforefaid of Brounber was mafter of St. John's college in 
Cambridge, and founder of the fchool at Ravenftondale as aforefaid.
And 
Mr. Anthony Fothergill, late of Brounber deceafed, without any afliftance from 
a liberal education, by the mere force of natural endowments, was the author 
of feveral confiderable trails, religious and controverfial : Unto whofe fon and 
heir Mr. Thomas Fothergill of Brounber we are obliged for feveral of the above 
particulars relating to this parifh.
Dr. George Fothergill aforefaid, principal of Edmund hall in Oxford, was 
one of the moft eminent tutors of his time, whilft he was fellow of Queen's 
college.
He was a perfon univerfally efteemed, pious, benevolent, learned, 
humane.
Befides his other benefactions, he gave 30 or 40/ towards the build- 
ing of the new church in Ravenftondale, and laid out near 20/ in a prefent to 
the fame of communion plate.
The feats, when finifhed, were fold, towards 
defraying the expences of the whole, to the feveral owners of the refpecYive 
meffuages and tenements within the parifh.
There were divers Quakers who 
refufed to purchafe.

At a place called Rafate (the word rafe meaning an hill or rifing ground) 
not far from Sunbiggin tarn, are two tumuli^ in which have been found many 
dead mens bones; the bodies being laid round about the hills, with the heads 
all lying upwards towards the hill top, and the hands laid upon their breads.
In the high ftreet, leading from Kirkby Stephen to Sedbergh, near Raw- 
they bridge, is a circle of large ftones, fuppofed to be a monument of Druid 
worfhip.
At Ravenftondale town head is a tarn or lough, which in Mr. Machel's time 
was well (locked with perches and eels.
About half a mile from the town head, in the year 1774, was found in 
digging peats, two foot below the furface, a copper vefTel, found and intire, 
the diameter whereof at the bottom is 8 inches, at the top 14 inches, in the 
wideft part juft under the neck 16 inches; the depth 18 inches; it contains 
about 8 gallons and an half.
It is made of three plates of copper, neatly 
joined together, and hath been pretty much ufed as a fire vefTel. It is very 
(lender; and therefore there are fixed fix fillets of copper at equal diftances, 
which reach up the fides two inches and an half, and are turned down about 
as much upon the bottom.
That part of the fillets turned over part of the 
bottom, is a good deal thicker than the other extremities which go up the 
fides, and are ornamented with ridges, fomewhat in the nature of fluting.
The vefTel, when fet down, refts on the thicker part of thefe fillets, which 
keeps it fteady, and the bottom from any wear or bulging.
There is no iron 
in any part of it.
Two ears or handles are fixed on the infide, the tops of 
which are on a level with the edge of the vefTel ; in each of which is a move- 
able ring.
Thefe ears and rings are pretty ftrong and mafTy, but of bafer 
metal.
The whole is of excellent workmanfhip, and very elegantly finifhed.

'HP HE church of this place, {landing on the top of a fteep hill or mount, 
* hath caufed that fometimes the village is called Crojby on the Hill.
Mod 
commonly it is called Crojby Garret, fuppofed to be from a like reafon, foraf- 
much as the higheft rooms in houfes are called garrets.
But in reality, Garret 
is no other than a corruption of Gerard, for it was always anciently written 
Crojby Gerard, moft probably from the name of the owner.
This parifh is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Mufgrave and Kirkby

Afby, Ormfide, Warcop, Mufgrave, and Kirkby Stephen : And contains about 
59 families ; of which, diftenters 9.

It hath been all along in the patronage of the lord of the manor.
And 
therefore the hiftory of the church and of the manor will beft go together, and' 
conduce in fome meafure to illuftrate each other.
The firft account we have of either, is in the year 1296, 25 Ed. 1.
when 
William de Souleby lord of the manor being then under age and in wardfhip to 
Ifabella daughter of the laft Robert de Veceripont, and then widow of Roger 
de Clifford, fhe the faid Ifabella, in right of her faid ward, prefented to the 
rectory of Crofby Gerard one Thomas de Burgh fub Mora, who was thereupon 
inflituted by bifhop Halton.
In the next generation, we find the manor of Crofby Gerard in the hands of 
the Mufgraves, probably by marriage of the heirefs of Souleby (for there was 
an heirefs of Souleby.
at that time, namely, Johan daughter of the faid William 
de Souleby).
And in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford fon of 
the aforefaid Roger and Ifabella, the inquifition finds, that Richard de Muj grave- 
held of the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, the manor of Crofby 
Gerard â€¢, the wardfhip whereof, together with Little Mufgrave which he then 
alfo held, was worth 34/ a year.
The faid Richard held then alfo a moiety of 
the manor of Orton.
And the cornage for all the three was 26 s %d.
In the 28 Ed. 3.
Henry de Sandford was rector of Crofby Gerard, having ob- 
tained in that year from the bifhop a licence of abfence for the better follow- 
ing of his ftudies ; and three years after, the like grant was renewed to him,

So far back as we have any account, 
this manor of Little Mufgrave, as well as Great Mufgrave, belonged to that 
ancient family which gave name to both places, and who ftill continue lords 
of both the faid manors.
In the reign of king Charles the fecond, Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave knight,

pofed to be author of the remonftrance by the tenants againft the lords claim 
before mentioned of an abfolute eftate in their tenements.
In the time of Oliver Cromwell, Francis Higginfon appears to have been 
vicar.
He was very active againft the Quakers, who fprang up at that timej 
and writ two very notable pamphlets againft themf.
In 
* Bp. Nicholfon.
f As thefe difcourfes of Mr Higginfon are extremely fcarce (for we have not found more than 
one printed copy thereof) it may not be amifs to preferve fome of the contents of the fame.
From thefe it appears, that the Quakers at their fiift fetting forward committed various kinds of 
extravagances and diforders ; which probably, if they had not b^en oppofed, would more readily 
have fubfided.
But the minifters, jutfices of the peace, conftables, and others, followed thefe 
people about, difputed with them, bound them over to the peace, procured them to be indited, 
and by fuch oppofuion rendered the fed confiderable.
Mr. Higginfon produceth infiances of 
thefe people running about the ftreets, foaming, and bellowing out fuch like expreffions as thefe, 
" Repent, repent ; Wo, wo !
The judge of the world is come !" Some of them flood naked 
upon the market crofs, on the market days, preaching from thence to the people.
Particularly, 
he mentions the wife of one Edmund Adlington of Kendal who went naked through iha ftreets 
there.
And two others of the fociety, a man and a woman, who called themfelves Adam and Eve, 
went publickly naked; and uhen examined concerning the fame at the affizes, the man affirmed 
that the power of God was upon him, and he was commanded fo to do.
Many of them in their affemblies, fometimes men, but more frequently women and children, 
or they who had long faffed, would fall down fuddenly as in an epileptic fit, and there lie gro-

lips would quaver, their flefh and joints would tremble, and their bellies fwell like a blown 
bladder.
In fuch fit they continued fometimes an hour or two, and when it left them, they roared 
out with a voice loud and horrible.
All which eafily accounts for the name of Quakers being 
given to them.
In their preaching, they called themfelves, " The way, the truth, and the life." One James 
Milner declared himfelf to be God and Chrift: For which blafphemy being imprifoned at 
Appleby, and the wife of one Williamfon coming to fee him there, fhe profefied herfelf publickly 
to be the eternal fon of God. And the men that heard her, telling her that could not be, 
becaufe flie was a woman, Ihe anfwered, No, you are women, but I am a man.
They railed at the judges fitting upon the bench, calling them fcarlet coloured beafts.
The 
juftices of the peace they ftyled " Juftices y2> called â€¢" and faid there would be Quakers in England, 
when there fhould be no juftices of the peace.
They made it a conftant practice to enter into the churches with their hats on during divine 
fervice, and to rail openly and exclaim aloud againft the minifters with reproachful words, calling 
them liars, deluders of the people, Baal's priefts, Babylon's merchants felling beaftly ware, 
and bidding them come down from the high places.
One inftance of this kind (ludicrous 
enough) happened at Orton.
Mr. Fothergill, vicar there, one Sunday exchanged pulpits with, 
Mr. Dalton of Shap, who had but one eye.
A quaker ftalking as ufual into the church at Orton, 
whilft Mr. Dalton is preaching, fays, Come down thou falfe Fothergill.
Who told thee, fays 
Mr. Dalton, that my name was Fothergill ?
The Spirit, quoth the Quaker.
That fpirit of thine 
is a lying fpirit, fays the other; for it is well known I am not Fothergill, but peed Dalton of 
Shap.
There was one juftice Burton, who attended at Kendal, Kirkby Stephen, Orton, and other places, 
together with the minifters, to endeavour to fupprefs thefe diforders, and (amongft the reft) com- 
mitted James Nayler of famous memory to Appleby gaol, for want of finding fureties for his good 
behaviour.
Soon after this, Mr. Burton one night going home (to Brampton) from Appleby, 
was way-laid by four mufketeers, two on each fide of the lane, every one of whom difcharged 
his mufket at the juftice as he patted along, but happily miffed both him and his fervant.
It 
was not known who thefe four perfons were.
It was believed they were Quakers, fome of the 
Quakers having given out before, that they would pick his fkin full of holes.
And they had not 
then taken up the principle of not bearing arms ; for many of them, and Nayler among the reft, 
had been Cromwell's foldiers.
The faid James Nayler, at the profecution of Mr. Higginfon, Mr. Fothergill, and other 
minifters, was inditted at Appleby for blafphemy, at the Chriltmafs feflion in the year 1652.
His 
examination thereupon was as follows : 
Juftice Pear/on.
Put off your hat.
James.
I do it not in contempt of authority ; for I honour the power as it is of God, without 
refpecting mens perfons, it being forbidden in fcripture.
He that refpe&s perfons, commits fin, 
and is convinced of the law as a tranfgreffor.
Juftice Pear/on.
That is meant of refpefting perfons in judgment.
James.
If I fee one in goodly apparel and a gold ring, and fee one in poor and vile raiment, 
and fay to him in fine apparel, Sit thou in a higher place than the poor, I am partial, and a judge 
of evil thoughts.
Col. Brigs.
If thou wert in the parliament houfe, wouldft thou keep it on ?
James.
Jf God fhould keep me in the fame mind I am in now, I fhould.
Col. Brigs.
I knew thou wouldft contemn authority, 
James.

What fayeft thou to it?
James.
Where God commands one thing, and man another, I am to obey God rather than 
man.

that there was but one word of God, and the like.

What was the caufe of thy coming into thefe parts ?

I was in the fields at the plough in barley 
feed time, meditating on the things of God, and fuddenly I heard a voice faying unto me, Get thee 
out from thy kindred, and from thy father's houfe; and I had a promife given in with it : where- 
upon I did exceedingly rejoyce, that I had heard the voice of that God which I had profefled 
from a child, but whom before that day I had neverknown.
So I went home, and flayed there a 
good while ; and not being obedient to the heavenly call, I was in a fad condition, as my friends 
know, and thofe that knew me wondered at me, and thought I was diftrafted, and that I would 
never have fpoken nor eaten more.
Col. Brigs, (interrupting him).

No, friend ; it was not a carrial voice, audible to the outward ear.

and I began to make fome preparation, as apparel and other neceffaries ; but a while after, going 
agateward -with a friend from my own houfe, having an old fuit without any money, having neither 
taken leave of wife or children, nor thinking of any journey, the voice came to me again, com- 
manding me to go into the weft, not knowing whither I fhould go, nor what I was to do there ; 
but when I had been there a little while, it was given me what I was to declare ; and ever fince I 
have remained, not knowing to-day what I am to do to-morrow.

I look upon it as an unmeet expreffion, and Ihould not have 
ufed it, had 1 not been drawn to it upon this occafion.
Difcourfing with Nayler at Mallerftane 
about the reality of Chrift's human nature, I alked him whether he did believe that Jefus Chrift, 
now glorified in heaven, was a true real man, as well as true God. When, according to his man- 
ner, he laboured to fpeak as ambiguoufiy as he could, and would plainly affirm or deny nothing ; 
urging him with the fame queftion again, with fome little alteration, 1 afked him, whether he did 
believe that Jefus Chrift was now in heaven in a body of flefti ; to which when I prefled him to 
anfwer plainly, Thomas Airey, one of Nayler's companions, faid to me thus ; Doft thou imagine 
that the body of Chrift in heaven is a carnal body ?
To which 1 anfwered prefently, thinking they 
had underftood Englifti language; Thomas, take the word carnal, not as it is ufed in the fcripture, 
in oppofition to that which is holy or fpiritual, but according to its natural and proper fignification, 
as it fignifies flefhly, and fo 1 believe the body of Chrift in heaven to be a carnal body, that is (as I 
faid) a body of flefh.

The church has two rows of pillars, fix in a row, plain and round.
On the

About the table, on the edges, beginning at the weft end, is the following

At the weft end have been three coats of arms, now defaced \ mofl pro*

On each fide there are four niches, wherein have been the effigies of feveral 
perfons, with their refpective bearings ; probably branches of the Wharton

On the fouth fide of the chancel is a large quire belonging to Hartley,

Betwixt the chancel and this quire, under the great arch, is the figure of a 
man in armour, with a fword at his right fide, and fomething like a broken 
fpear or truncheon at his left.
Under his head, an old fafhioned helmet, and a 
lion couchant at his leer, lying upon a table of ftone, with nich- work on the fides.
This is commonly faid to be a cenotaph in memory of Sir Andrew Harclay 
earl of Carlifie, But by the annulets on the breaft plate, it feemeth rather to 
have been for one of the Mufgraves.
The faid Sir Andrew, for high treafon, 
was degraded from his earldom and knighthood, and afterwards beheaded, and 
his head and quarters fet up in different parts of the kingdom.

This confideration of horns generally ufed upon the creft, feemeth to accountfor what hath hitherto

The notion of cuckolds weaving horns prevails through all the modern European languages, and is 
of four or five hundred years ftanding.
The particular eflimation of badges and diftinftion of arms 
began in the time of the crufades, being then more efpecially neceflary to diftinguifh the feveral 
nations of which the armies were compofed.
Horns upon the creft (according to that of Silius

were erefled in terrorem.
And af.er the hufband had been abfent for three or four years, and came 
borne in his regimental accoutrements, it might be no impoffible fuppofition, that the man who wor&-

MANOR OF KIRKBY STEPHEN.
The manor of Kirkby Stephen, in the time of the faid Roger lord Clifford, 
was all in the hands of the Cliffords, as parcel of the manor of Brough.
Part 
of it hath been fold off; and it now belongs to three feveral lords, namely, 
the earl of Thanet as defcendent of the Cliffords, Sir Philip Mufgrave ba- 
ronet, and Sir James Lowther baronet.
In the partition of the inheritance between the two daughters of the laft 
Robert de Veteripont, in the reign of king Edward the firft, we find that the 
manor of Kirkby Stephen was affigned to Idonea intire, except five acres of 
demefne land there.
And the yearly value thereof was eftimated at 39/ 
16 s qd.
The inquifition in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, finds, 
that at Kirkby Stephen he died feifed of one capital meffuage or manor houfe, 
worth by the year one {hilling.
Fifty acres of demefne land, worth $d an 
acre.
Several acres of meadow, worth 16 d an acre.
Certain marfh land held 
by Henry de Warthecop, worth by the year 8 s.
Six oxgangs of land worth 
by the year 9/.
Ten meffuages of cottagers, worth is each.
One water miln, 
worth by the year 67.
In the inquifition poft mortem of Roger de Clifford, in the 1 Ed. 3.

fuch name.
Karne is Britifh, and fignifies a rock.
There is a romantic place, 
where the river Eden runs between Kirkby Stephen and Nateby, at Stenkrith- 
bridge, where there are numbers of rocks, with round holes therein, from one 
foot to fix or more in diameter, and deep proportionably from fix inches to one 
two or more yards.
The largeft of thefe, juft above the bridge, is called Coop- 
karnel hole, by an evident derivation from coop, hollow, and karn, a rock.
Whe- 
ther thefe are the operations of nature or the effects of human labour hath been 
doubted.
There are no other fuch any where to be found thereabouts, or elfe- 
where in the county, but only juft at this place, about 80 or 100 paces above 
and below the bridge.
They cannot have been made by the river, for fome 
of them are higher than the river ever rifes, unlefs perhaps fometimes in an 
exceeding high flood.
Dr. Borlafe, in his account of Cornwall, defcribes a 
rocky place formed exactly in the fame manner, and concludes it to have been 
a Druid place of worfhip, and the hollows to have been made for wafhings, 
purifications, and the like.
The fituation here hath indeed, in other refpefts, 
much the appearance of Druidifm ; for it is well known that the Druids af- 
fected places of (hade and folitude.
To look down from Stenkrith bridge 
into the cavities amongft the rocks, with wood hanging over, the water roar- 
inÂ» by the depth of the fall, then foaming and as it were feeking a pafifage, 
then hiding itfelf and appearing again from the gaping clefts below, is apt to 
infufe a kind of religious horror and veneration.
Even the word Stenkrith 
hath in it fomething of Britifh.
The Jlone there hath a mixture of red, which 
colour the Britons exprefled by rith; as Penrith in Cumberland means red-hill.
It doth not appear where flood the ancient capital meffuage or manor houfe 
above mentioned.
There is a good houfe at a place called Melbecks (that is, 
between the brook which runs by it on one fide, and the river Eden on the 
other; met being an old word which fignifies between; fo the pafiage betwixt 
two doors is called Meldoors) ; which houfe, together with a confiderable eftate 
in land, belonged to an ancient family of the name of Hartley at this place.
Of whom, Hugh Hartley gentleman married Jane daughter of Mr. Rowland 
Scaife of Blafterfield and Winton, and by her had iflue, r.
Edward.
2. Agnes, 
married to Mr. Thomas Raw of Kirkby Stephen.
3. Ifabel, married to Mr.
Michael Wharton of Wharton Dikes.
The faid Edward Hartley, fon of Hugh, had a fon Hugh â€¢, who alfo had a 
fon Hugh ; who had a fon Edward; who had a fon Hugh; who was fucceeded 
by his brother Aider/on Hartley, M.

who, dying unmarried, was fucceeded in this inheritance by his elded fifter

MANOR OF HARTLEY.
It would be difficult to form any derivation of this word, as it (lands 
corrupted in the prelent fpelling, framed from the found only.
But the 
further we go back, the more the true derivation unfolds itfelf.

(Hartley.).
famous Sir Andrew,- afterwards earl of Carlifle, was furnamed de Harda-%.
and in a few generations further back, the word was moil commonly, writtea 
Hardday.
And the foil of the place fufficiently indicates the reafon of the 
name.
This manor for a long time continued in the name of Hardday.
In the 
flrfl: year of the reign of king Edward the firft, there was a difpute con^ 
cerning the manor of Dalfton in Cumberland, between Michael de.
Ha-rdayt 
knight (father of the faid Sir And few) plaintiff, and.
the bifhop of Carlifle 
defendant; wherein, the plaintiff derived his defcent from Hervicius^ who was.
feized of the faid manor of Dalfton in the reign of king Henry the firft, who- 
was fueceeded by his brother Robert., who was fucceeded by another brother 
Walter, who had a fon Michael, who had a fon Walter, who had a foa 
Mkhaelj who had a fon William, who had a fon Michael the prefeat 
plaintiff.
Accordingly, in the reign of king.
Henry the fecond, to an agreement and 
compromife concerning the boundaries of the manors, of Bleatarn and Muf- 
grave* the names of two of the witneffes are, Michael de Hardday, and Walter 
his- fon.
In the 6th year of king John, we find Michael de Hardday, fon of (the lafl) 
Walter.
In the 13th year of the fame king, 'John de Hardday was witnefs to Robert 
de Vetefipont's* grant to Shap abbey.
Which John feems to have been a 
collateral, and not in the direct courfe of primogeniture.
In like manner, to a grant of lands and wood at Brampton, by Walter de 
Moreville to the faid Robert de Veteripont, one of the witneffes was John 
de Hafclay< 
In the reign of king Henry the third, the grant of the advowfon of the 
rectory of Kirkby Thore, by Adam de Kirkby Thore to the faid Robert,..
Was attefted by Michael de Hardday.
In the 14 Ed. I.
in the partition of the inheritance between the two 
daughters and coheirs of the laft Robert de Veteripont, mention is made of 
Michael de Hardday holding the manor of Hardclay under them.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds,, 
that Andrew de Harda held the manors of Harcla and Smerdale* aod that 
the wardship of Harcla^ when it mould happen, was worth by the year 40 l\ 
and of Smerdale, 61 1 3 j â–  \d.
And the cornage for them both 26 s.
In the 13th year of the fame king, this Andrew de Harclay.
was created 
earl of Carlifle, to him and the heirs male of his body ; which is the firft 
record that mentions an intail of a title to the heir male.
He was afterwards, 
in the reign of the fame king, attainted, degraded, and executed for high 
treafon as aforefaid â€¢, and his eftates being forfeited to the crown, the manor 
of Hartley was granted by the faid king to Nevil baron of Raby, who fold 
the fame to Sir Thomas Mufgrave > of Mufgrave knight, m whole pofterity it 
ftill continues.
The family of Mufgrave often reflded at Hartley caftle, during which time 
the caftle was kept in good repair ; and there was a park behind it welt 
replenilheci

(Hartl&v.) 547 
heplenifhed with deer.
It was a noble building, (landing upon an eminence, 
and overlooking the village of Hartley, the town of Kirkby Stephen, and 
many other villages.
The late Sir Chriftopher Mufgrave, father of the prefent 
owner Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet, in a great meafure demolifhed the fame, 
and removed the materials of wood and lead for the reparation of his feat at 
Edenhall in Cumberland : and nothing now remains thereof, but the vener- 
able ruins of part of the old walls.
There have at feveral times confiderable quantities of lead been got within 
the manor of Hartley ; and alfo a feam of coal hath been worked upon 
Hartley fell, being the feam of Stanemore coal diminifhing gradually ; but 
the profits thereof from time to time have not been thought, fufiicient to en- 
courage the continuance of the working.
IV.
MANOR OF WINTON.
WINTON probably had its name from fome remarkable battle fought 
there: for win in the Saxon fignifies battle; and to win is ftill in ufe to 
denote victory in battle or otherwife.
So there is Winchefier^ JVinwick t Win- 
thorpe^ and the like.
This manor continued all along in the hands of the Veteriponts and Cliffords, 
as it doth in the pofleflion of their pofterity to this day ; being parcel of the 
manor of Brough ; without ever having been granted off to any inferior 
lord : Except fome fmall parcels thereof, which are now held under divers 
inferior lords, part thereof alfo having been infranchifed at different times.
In the divifion of the inheritance, in the reign of king Edward the 
firft, between the two daughters and coheirs of the laft Robert de Veteri- 
pont, we find that each of them had a moiety of the manor of Winton, 
the value whereof was then eftimated in the whole at the yearly fum of 
48 / 4J 6^d.
In the 8th Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition 
finds, that the faid Robert de Clifford, on the day on which he died, held 
at Winton one capital meffuage, worth yearly 1 s ; 100 acres of demefhe 
land, worth yearly 6d an acre ; 20 acres of demefne meadow, worth 1 s an 
acre yearly ; that he had there alfo foreland and wafte, worth yearly 5 s ; 
28 oxgangs of land, at 5s a.
year each; 10 mefluages of cottagers, worth 
each by the year 1 s ', one water mill burnt, worth yearly 4/; that there 
were alfo free tenants there, who paid yearly 6s^~d- 3 and that Henry 
de Warthecop held there certain marfhy grounds, for which he paid 
yearly 8 s.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
.that the faid John, on the day on which he died, held at Winton 20 mef- 
fuiges, worth nothing in all iffues above reprizes (by reafon of the deftruction 
made by the Scots) ; 40 oxgangs of land, worth yearly 3 s 4^ each; 80 acres 
4 A 2 of 
54 8 PARISH OF KIRKBY STEPHEN.
(Winton) 
of meadow, worth yearly 6d each; 6ob acres of pafture, worth yearly *(T 
each-, and the water mill, worth yearly x^s \d.
The capital mefluage or manor houfe above mentioned feems to have been 
that which is now called the hall, at the upper end of the town.
This hall 
belonged heretofore to the name and family of Scayfe ; which appears to 
have been of ancient ftanding in this and the neighbouring places.
So early 
as the reign of Ed. 2.
John Scayfe (in the 6th year of that king) ferved in 
parliament as burgefs for Appleby j and again in the ill and in the 2 d of Ed.
3. In the 17 Ed. 3.
Thomas Scayfe reprefented the faid borough in parlia- 
ment.
In the 4 Ed. 4.
Thomas Scayfe was a juror on the inquifition pcfi 
mortem of the fecond John de Clifford.
In the 8 Eliz.
Miles Skeyffe was.
con- 
ftituted one of the firft governors of.
Kirkby Stephen fchooL There was one 
major Scaife in Oliver Cromwell's time, who obtained a confiderable (hare of 
the fequeftred eftates.
The laft of the family in the direct line, Mr. Robert 
Scaife, fold Winton hall to Mr. Gerard Andretvs ; whofe daughter and heir 
Mrs. Bowes Andrews the prefenc owner was married to Bartholomew Dixon 
gentleman, and hath no iffue.
The fchool is an handfbme little building, which was erected in the- year 
i^>S9-> at tne expence of feveral of the principal inhabitants and land owners, 
but chiefly of the reverend William Morland, M.
A. who was bred at Jefus 
college in Cambridge, was made fchoolmafter of Kirkby Stephen in the year 
1630, and in 1639 was inftituted to the rectory of Grayftock in Cumberland, 
and ejected in 16 30 by Cromwell's commiflioners, and afterwards reftored on 
the return of king Charles the fecond.
In 1681, Robert Waller of Winton yeoman granted divers parcels 
of freehold land in Kaber to four feoffees in truft for the ufe of the fchool- 
mafter.
And in the year 1722, Richard Munkhoufe of Winton gentleman, gave 
by his will, for the better endowment of the faid fchool, the fum of 100/; 
provided the feoffees, within 3 months after his deceafe, mould grant the fole 
nomination of a fchoolmafter on all future vacancies unto his broiher Thomas 
Munkhoufe gentleman and his heirs for ever.
He alfo gave 10/ towards the 
repairs of the faid fchool, and 40J for making a garden on the wafte ground 
thereto adjoining.
In purfuance whereof, there are two (tones put up in the 
front wall of the fchoolhoufe, fetting forth both the faid benefactions, and the 
confent and agreement of the feoffees, that Mr. Thomas Munkhoufe and his 
heirs (hall have the nomination of a fchoolmafter, referving to themfelves a 
power of difplacing him (that is, for neglect, or immorality, or fuch other 
caufe for which a fchoolmafter by the laws of this realm may be deprived).
Mrs. Dorothy Munkhoufe, widow of the faid Mr. Thomas Munkhoufe, 
by her will in the year 1755 gave the legal intereft of 50/ for ever, for pro- 
viding 6 loaves of Maflin bread, to be diftributed in Kirkby Stephen church 
every Sunday throughout the year, to fix poor perfons reliding within the 
parifh â€¢, and appointed her fon Richard Munkhoufe efquire, his heirs and 
afllgns, fole truftees of the faid charity.

MANOR OF KA'B'ER.
From what original this place derives its name, doth not fufficiently appear.
It was always anciently written Kabergb.
Bergb, it is well known, means 
town.
Perhaps the other component of the word may have been the name of 
the owner : for Kay is a name yet not uncommon.
In the reign of king Henry the fecond, we find a perfon of confiderable 
note, of the name of Robert de Kabergb, 
In the reign of king John, Robert fon of Robert de Kabergb was a witnefs 
to divers inftruments.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Alan de Kabergb held of the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, 
the manor of Kabergh, by homage and fealty, and the cornage of iys %d.
In the next king's reign, we find the fame or part thereof in the name of 
Rookby.
For in the 9 Ed. 3.
Thomas de Rookby obtained a grant of free 
warren in Kabergh.
And in the 31ft of the fame king, John de Rookby 
levied a fine of the moiety of the manor of Kabergh.
Or rather, this 
feems to denote the village of Rookby, as being part of the manor of 
Kaber at large.

MANOR OF SOULBY.
The name of this place in ancient time was moft commonly written Sullehy : 
whether from the name of the owner, or how otherwife, we have not found.
But that the owners, in after time, received their name from the place, there 
is no doubt.
In the reign of king John, one of the witneffes to the grant of the 
advowfon of the church of Kirkby Thore by Adam de Kirkby Thore to 
Robert de Veteripont, was Henry de Sulleby.
To a grant of lands at Brampton by Walter de Morvil to the faid Robert 
de Veteripont, one of the witneffes was Robert de Sullebi.
To a grant of privilege to the men of Kirkby Thore, by John fon of the 
faid Robert de Veteripont, one of the witneffes was Henry de Sulleby: 
In the 36 Hen. 3 .
a fettlement was made, by Richard lbn of Henry de 
Suleby, on the marriage of Robert his eldeft fon with Alice eldeft daughter of 
Sir Thomas de Hellebeck.
Witneffes whereof were, Sir William de Dacre, 
John de Moreville, Thomas de Mufgrave then fheriff of Weftmorland, 
William parfon of Crofby Gerard, Robert his brother, Henry de Standley, 
William de Warthecop, and William de Soureby.
The next we meet with was William de Souleby, who had a fon and 
heir in wardfhip to Ifabella de Clifford j in whofe right fhe prefented to the 
reclory of Crofby Gerard, in the 25th year of the reign of king Edward 
the firft.
But it feems that this fon died foon after, and was fucceeded by his fitter Jcban 
then alfo under age.
For we find the wardfhip of the body and land of Jo an, 
daughter and heir of Will am de Sulleby, committed to John de Helton and 
t Flem.

Agnes his wife ; rendring a reafonable rent during her minority, to John St.
John and Thomas Penerell, executors of the laft will and teftament of the faid 
Ifabella, widow of Roger de Clifford.
And foon after, we find the manor of Soulby in another name and 
family.
For in 3 Ed. 2.
on an inquifition of tenants in Weftmorland who held 
by cornage tenure, it was found, that Thomas Muf grave of Mufgrave, who 
was then under age, held the manor of Soulby.
And at the fame time, 
Thomas Bowet held four oxgangs of land in Soulby and Warcop, for which 
he paid 6 <i cornage.
In 8 Ed. 2.
Thomas de Hellebeck held a moiety of Soulby.
The wardfhip 
of the faid manor, when it fbould happen, was eftimated at 30/ a yearj the 
cornage 13 s ^d.
In the 32 Ed. 3.
Sir Thomas Mufgrave obtained a charter of free warren, in 
his demefne lands at Soulby.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
Thomas de Mufgrave, William de Wharton, and William de 
Styrkland, held the manor of Soulby.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
Richard Mufgrave, and Henry de Wharton held the manor 
of Soulby, the cornage whereof was then faid to be in 4 d.
And at the 
fame time William de Lowther held 4 oxgangs in Soulby, and 16 acres in 
Warcop, of the yearly cornage of 6d.
And William de Styrkland held divers 
lands and tenements at Soulby, of the like yearly cornage of 6d.
From henceforth, the manor of Soulby feems invariably to have continued 
in the name and family of Mufgrave â€¢, except only two or three tenements 
which are holden of Smardale hall, and feem to be thofe which had been 
granted off feparate as abovementioned.
The hall or manor houfe, feems to have been in the grounds now called 
Hall-garths.
And there are lands called the demefne, now held in te- 
nancy.
The chapel of Soulby was built at the coll of Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet, 
lord of the manor, in the year 1663; and in the fame year was confecrated 
by bifhop Stern.
In the a<5t of confecration it is fet forth, that the faid Sir 
Philip Mufgrave and his heirs and afiigns, lords of the manor of Hartley 
caftle, (hall repair the faid chapel from time to time : That the inhabitants 
of Soulby, in token of their fubjection to the mother church, ihall three 
times in the year at leaft, of which Eafter to be one, repair to the mother 
church, and there hear divine fervice, and receive the facrament : That the 
faid Sir Philip Mufgrave during his life, and after his death his heirs and 
afiigns, lords of the manor of Hartley caftle, lhall have power from time 
to time to nominate a fit minifter, to be approved and licenfed by the bifhop: 
So as that the faid Sir Philip Mufgrave, and his heirs and afiigns as aforefaid, 
fhall maintain the faid minifter or curate, and allow him at leaft 20/ a year,

MANOR OF SMARDALE.
Smerk is the ancient name of that fort of grafs now called clover, and 
is a word not yet quite out of ufe in that refpect.
And in old times, this 
place was mod commonly written Smeredale.
This manor was anciently in the family of the name de Smeredale y who 
came to it by purchafe from Thomas de Helbeck in the 20 Ed. 1.
Afterwards, we find it in the poffeffion of Sir Andrew de Harclay , for in 
the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, that 
Sir Andrew de Harclay held Harclay and Smerdale ; that the wardship of 
Harclay was worth 40/ a year, and of Smerdale 61 8s \d\ and the cornage 
for them both 26s.
But after his attainder, this manor came again into the family of Smerdale; 
which family, like many of the reft, ended in a daughter, who was married 
to a younger brother of the War cops of V/arcop.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition 
finds, that Thomas fon of John Warcop, in the right of Katherine his wife, 
held of the faid Roger the manor of Smerdale, by homage and fealty and the 
cornage of 13 s \d.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
Thomas Warcop of Lamberfet held the manor of Smer- 
dale â€¢, and afterwards, in the fame year, Reginald Warcop held the fame.
Which Reginald died in the 8 Hen. 7.
as appears by inquifition, Edward 
Warcop his fon and heir being then 24 years of age.
Which Edward Warcop married Anne daughter of Thomas Layton, and 
by her had iffue, 
John Warcop of Smardale â€¢, who by a rental of Henry earl of Cumberland 
in the 18 Hen. 8.
appears then to have held Smardale of the faid earl.
He married Anne daughter of Jeffrey Lancaster of Crake-trees , and 
had iffue, 
Thomas IVarcop of Smardale, who lived in the reign of queen Elizabeth, 
and married Elizabeth daughter of Rowland Thorn burgh, and by her had 
iffue two daughters coheirs.
Frances the elder was married to Sir John 
Dalslon of Dalfton in Cumberland knighr, with whom he had Smardale.
Agnes the younger was married to Talbot Bowes of Eglefton abbey efquire, 
fecond fon of Sir George Bowes.
And 
PARISH OF KIRKBY STEPHEN.
(Smardalk.) 555 
And here ended the name of War cop of Smardale.
Their arms were the 
fame as thofe of the Warcops of Warcop, viz.
Sable, three covered cups 
Argent : with a crefcent for diftindion of the younger houfe.
And thus the manor became transferred to the family of Dalston, in 
which it ftill continues.
The laid Sir "John Dalfton of Dalfton was fon of Thomas, from whom def- 
cended by a younger fon the Dalftons of Acorn Bank.
Which Thomas was 
fon of John, fon of Robert, fon of Henry, brother of John, fon of John, fon 
of Henry, fon of Simon, fon of Henry, fon of Adam, fon of Henry, fon of 
Reginald, fon of Robert (brother to Hubert de Vallibus firft baron of Gilfland) 
to whom Ranulph de Mefchiens gave the barony of Dalfton, and who there- 
upon took the name de Dalfton.
In the defcending line, the faid Sir John Dalfton had a fon John, father of 
George, father of William, father of George, brother of John, father of Charles ', 
father of Sir George Dalfton baronet, who died in 1765, leaving only an 
infant daughter Elizabeth.
The arms of Dalfton are; Argent, a cheveron ingra'ded, between three 
ravens heacis erafed Sable, billed (Jr. The creft ; Out of a ducal crown Or, 
a falcon's head Proper.
Smardale hall is an ancient building, which was confiderably repaired by 
the late Sir George Dalfton, who inhabited there for fome time.
There hath been anciently a chapel, at a little diftance from the hall weft- 
ward ; where is a well yet called Chapel-well, which fprang up within the 
chapel.
VIII.
MANOR OF WAITBY.
This place was fometimes anciently written Wadeby, fometimes Waldebyi 
which feems to indicate its true derivation.
Waldcve was a nime not un- 
common â€¢, fo that Waldeby may probably lignify the fame as Waldevi locus, or 
Waldeve's (Waltheof's) feat or habitation.
King John, in the 5th year of his reign, granted the wardfhip of Hugh 
fon of Jernegan to Robert de Veteripont â€¢, and Maud, widow of Henry 
Jernegan releaied her dower in Karthorp near Tanfield in Yorkfhireto the faid 
Robert, who had the cuftody of her fon by the laid king's grant.
Which 
Maud was daughter and heir of Torphin de Wadeby ; and granted all her lands 
in Weflmorland to the faid Robert, in the 8th year of that king.
She was 
afterwards married to Hugh de Burgh her fecond hufband, who confirmed 
the faid grant.

(Waitby.) 
Not long after this, the manor of Waitby appears to have been divided 
into moieties, probably by the means of daughters coheirs.
About which time lived one Gilbert de Wateby, perhaps of a collateral 
branch of the family of Torphin ; who was witnefs to many grants and other 
instruments, by the ftyle and title of Gilbert de Wateby Clericus ; by which 
it feemeth that he was the conveyancer.
â€” After him, we find no other of the 
name de Wateby.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
William de Dacre held a moiety of the manor of Wateby, 
as alfo of Orton, the cornage whereof was 12 s 6d.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
Henry de Warthcop appears to have had the other moiety 
of Wateby, together with the manor of Warcop ; the wardfhip whereof was 
30/ a year, and cornage \y s Sd.
In the 11 Ed. 3.
a fine was levied of a moiety of the manor of Waitby 
by Robert Parving ; to hold to the faid Robert for life, remainder to Adam 
Peacock and the heirs male of his body, remainder to the right heirs of the 
faid Robert in fee.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
William de Dacre levied a fine of a moiety of the manor 
of Waitby.
And in the fame year it is found by inquifition, that Robert 
Parsings, Elena Huthwayt, and William d,e Thwayts, held the manor (perhaps 
the other moiety of the manor) of Waitby.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
and again in the 4 Hen. 4.
William de Strykland held a 
moiety of the faid manor, the cornage thereof being ys$d.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
William de Lowther held a moiety of the manor of 
Waldeby, by the cornage of ys $d.
And Ralph earl of Wejlmorland held 
the other moiety, together with the manor of Warthecop, by the cornage as 
aforefaid of lys 8d.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
George Nevil knight, lord Latimer, held a moiety of 
Waitby called Waitby- Agnes [which argues that it had been formerly divided 
between coheirs], and which (as the inquifition exprefTeth) Richard Warcop 
formerly held : And at the fame time Thomas Beauchamp held the other 
moiety.
In the 19 Hen. 7.
Thomas Blenkinfcp held a moiety of the manors of 
Wateby and Orton ; and Thomas, father of the faid Thomas (as the inquifition 
fets forth) died feifed thereof in the 10 Ed. 4.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
John Bell, John Hoton, the heirs of Thomas Mufgrave, 
and Thomas Lancafier, in right of their wives, daughters and coheirs of 
Thomas Beauchamp, held a moiety of the manor of Wateby ; and Geoffrey 
Lancafler the other moiety.
After this, we have met with no further particular account, till the reign 
of king James the fecond ; when Sir John Lowther of Sockbridge, who 
married one of the coheirs of Lancafter, fold the lands, confiding of ^3 tene- 
ments, to freehold.
And in 1713, his fon James Lowther of Whitehaven, efquire, fold the 
manor to Richard Munkhoufe of Winton gentleman, from whom the fame 
defcended to the prefent owner Richard Munkhoufe of Winton efquire;

The fchool at Waitby was built in the year 1630, by Mr. James Highmore 
olothworker in London, who was born at Wakby â€¢, for the benefit of the 
inhabitants of "Waitby and Smardale.
And the fum of 400/ was given by 
him for thatufe, and for the ufe of the poor widows of thofe places â€¢, twelve 
twopenny loaves being ordered by his will to be distributed every funday to 
twelve widows, being 60 years of age and upwards.
In a rental of the eftates of Philip lord "Wharton, in the latter end of the 
reign of queen Elizabeth, there is a place called Abbot-hall at Waitby, then 
in the tenure of the wife of James Hindmore, (which probably had belonged 
to fome of the religious houies,) holden of the laid lord Wharton : And the 
vicar of Kirkby Stephen held there of the faid lord certain improved lands 
upon With bar and Calf clofe, of the yearly rent of gs.
IX.
MANOR OF NATEBY.
From whence Nateby had its name, we have not found.
Perhaps it might 
be, from the Nativi or bondmen inhabiting there, attendent upon the caftle 
of Pendragon ; even as Bondgate was fo called from its being the place of 
habitation of the fervile tenants of the caftle of Appleby.
And the Drengage 
tenure was the like of divers inhabitants of places adjacent to the caftle of 
Brougham.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Nicolas de Hajlinges then held the manors of Nateby and Crolby Ravenf- 
wath â€¢, that the wardihip of the fame, when it fhould happen, was worth 40/ 
a year ; and the cornage for them both 27 s id.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
Ralph Hajlinges held the manor of Nateby of Robert de 
Clifford, by homage and fealty, and cornage of 13 J yd.
In the to Hen. 5.
Richard Hajlinges held the fame in like manner.
In the 1 8 Hen. 8.
Thomas Wharton held the fame of Henry earl of Cum- 
berland ; which heretofore (as the inquifition expreffeth it) was held by the 
heirs of Nicholas Haftings.
After this, the fame continued in the Wharton family all along.
In the year 1693, Philips lord Wharton and Thomas Wharton his fon convey 
to truftees a clofe of pafture called Naitby Birkett, parcel of a leafe com- 
monly called there Naitby leafe, then in the poiTelTion of Hugh Wharton 
gentleman or his affigns at the yearly rent of 16/ ioj, and formerly at the 
rent of 22/: And all that clofe of meadow and pafture called Low Field 
in Ravenftonedale, late belonging to Robert "Waller, which came to the faid 
Philip lord Wharton by forfeiture on the attainder of the faid Robert Waller, 
containing fix acres: for the ufe of a licenfed diflenting meeting houfe in,

Finally, this manor of Nateby, together with the other Wharton eftates in 
Weftmorland, came by purchafe to Robert Lowther efquire, father of the 
prefent owner Sir James Lowther baronet.
X. 
MANOR OF WHARTON.
Wharton was anciently written Wherton, and when transferred into the 
barbarous latin of thofe days Querton ; for in the place of the letter W they 
frequently fubftitute ^, fometimes G, as when for ivar they fay gnerra : But 
whether this place may have had its name from fome battle fought there, can 
be only matter of conjecture.
So early as the reign of king Edward the firft, there was a family of note 
at this place of the name of Wharton.
One of whom married a daughter 
and coheir of Philip Haftings of Croglin in Cumberland ; whereby the 
Whartons obtained part of Croglin, as afterwards they got the whole.
And 
it is remarkable, that the Haftings' arms were the fame as thofe of the Whar- 
tons â€¢, or rather it may feem, that the Whartons took their arms at that time ; 
viz.
in a field Sable, a manch Argent.
Accordingly, in the next king's reign, we find, that Henry de Quherton pre- 
fented one W.
de Edenhall to the rectory of Croglyn.
And by an inquifuion in the 3 Ed. 2.
we find that Henry de Querton (the 
fame perfon) held of Robert de Clifford the manor of Querton, by the cor- 
nage of 6 s a year.
And in the 23 Ed. 3.
we find one Piers Tylliol holding his tenement at 
Croglin of Hugh de Wharton.
And in the laft year of the fame king, Hugh de Quertop prefented to the 
rectory of Croglin aforefaid.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
and again in the 4 Hen. 4.
William de Wherton held the 
- manor of Wherton, under the cornage aforefaid of 6 s.
In the 2 Hen. 5.
Richard de Wherton ferved in parliament as burgefs for 
Appleby.
And the 5 Hen. 5.
Richard de Wherton ferved as member for the 
county.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
Henry de Wharton held the manor of Wharton of John 
de Clifford.
Notwithstanding the indubitable authenticity of the preceding account, no- 
thing of all this is taken notice of in the pedigree certified at the heralds vifita- 
tion in 1585.
But the fame begins with, 
i, Thomas Wharton, who in the 31 Hen. 6.
held the manor of Wharton of 
Thomas de Clifford.
About which time alfo begins the pedigree of the 
Whartons of Kirkby Thore, with one John, probably a younger brother of 
this family.
The faid Thomas married (as the pedigree fets forth) a Lowther 
of Lowther.

Robert Coke efquire.
(3) Lucy, married to Sir William Morice baronet.
9. Philip, fixth lord Wharton, and fecond marquis of that name.
He was 
about 17 years of age at the death of his father.
He was a perfon of un- 
bounded genius, eloquence, and ambition : had all the addrefs and activity 
of his father, but without his fteadinefs : violent in parties, and expenfive in 
cultivating the arts of popularity ; which indeed ought to be in fome meafure 
charged to his education under fuch a father, who (it is faid) expended 
8o,coo/ in elections, an immenfe fum in thofe days; by which the eftate 
became incumbered, and the fon was not a perfon of ceconomy enough to 
difengage it.
In a word, if the father and fon had been one degree higher 
in life, and lived in Macedonia at the time of Philip and Alexander ; they 
would have done juft as Philip and Alexander did.
The young marquis fet out in the world a violent Whig, and for his extra- 
ordinary fervices, in parliament and out of it, was created duke of Wharton.
After that, he fet up in oppofition to the miniftry, then became a Tory, then, 
a Jacobite, then a rebel to his king and country, and accepted a commiffion 
in the king of Spain's army againft Gibraltar.
He married Martha daughter of major general Holmes; which being not 
adequate to his father's defigns and expectations, it is thought haftened his 
father's death (for he died within fix weeks after) : By her he had a fon, who 
died in his infancy.
He afterwards married a maid of honour of the queen of 
Spain, who furvived him, but had no iffue by him.
He died at the age of 32, in a Bernardine convent in a fmall village in 
Spain, where the charitable fathers hofpitably took him in ; and was buried in

FOREST OF MALLERSTANG.
Before the grant of the barony of Weftmorland to Robert de Veteripont, 
the foreft of Mallerftang (with the reft) belonged to Sir Hugh de Morvill\ 
and there is a large round hill yet called Hugh Morvill's feat, where Anne 
countefs of Pembroke erected a ftone pillar, and upon one of the ftones is this 
infcription, A.
P. 1664.
The caftle of Mallerftang, called Pendragon caftle, is faid to have been built 
about the the time of Vortigern, by Uter Pendragon.

There was a family of the name of Ughtred of 
ancient time.
And during the time of the Saxons in England before the 
Norman conqueft, there was a famous warrior of the name of Uchtred fon of 
Waltbecf earl of Northumberland, who with a much inferior army gave the 
Scots under their king Malcolm a moft fignal overthrow : for which victory 
king Ethelred gave to Uchtred his daughter the princefs Elgiva in marriage, 
and with her the counties of Northumberland and York for a portion.
Pendragon feems not to be properly the furname of a man, but an epithet 
only, defcribing his warlike quality.
Pen, it is well known, fignifies a moun- 
tain, or fomething that is great ; and dragon in all ages hath been applied to 
military perfons.
This Uter Pendragon, tradition reports, in order to fortify 
this his caftle, endeavoured to draw the river Eden round it, but to no pur- 
pofe ; which occafioned this proverb, 
Let Uter Pendragon do what he can, 
Eden will run where Eden ran.
After the death of John de Veteripont, in the reign of king Henry the third, 
the wardfhip of his fon Robert, during his minority, was committed to the 
prior of Carlifle, who fuffered great wafte to be committed in the eftates of 
the faid Robert â€¢, and particularly, on an inquifition thereof taken, it was 
found, that the vale of Mallerftang was much decayed by the multitude of 
vaccaries, and chiefly by the archery of Roger the forefter, and other archers 
of Lounldale, by default of the prior and for want of keeping.
Alfo, pur- 
preftures were made in many places within the foreft, and in the boundaries 
of the foreft, by fufferance of the faid prior after he took upon him the guar- 
dianship.
After the death of Roger de Clifford, in the 1 1 Ed. i.
it was found by in- 
quifuion, that the foreft of Mallerftang, in herbage and agiftment and all other 
iffues, was worth yearly 44/ 7 s 6d.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
the jurors find, that in the vale of Mallerftang there is one 
caftle called Pendragon, with a vaccary held by Andrew de Harcla of the 
rent of 6 d a year, and fix vaccaries more worth 20 s a year each, agiftment 
worth 6d year, turbary 6s S.d, pleas and perquifites of court 13J 4^.
In the 1 Ed. 3.
the jurors find, that belonging to Roger de Clifford deceafed 
was the caftle of Pendragon, together with the foreft of Mallerftang to the 
fame belonging; that the buildings in the caftle cannot be extended, for that 
the cofts of maintaining the fame exceed the profits thereof: I hat in the 
faid foreft there are divers vaccaries and other profits of herbage in the hands 
of tenants at will, who pay yearly at Martinmafs and Whitfuntide 30/.
In the 15 Ed. 3.
the Scots burned this caftle to the ground.
In the 36 Ed. 3.
the king granted to Roger de Clifford in fee, the vaccary 
called Southwaite in the foreft of Mallerftang.
In the reign of king Edward the fourth, during the attainder of Henry lord

The faid countefs alfo repaired and endowed the chapel^ as appears by the 
following infcription in the chapel porch : 
" This chappie of Mallerftang, after itt had layne ruinous and decayed 
*' fome 50 or 60 years, was newe repayred by the lady Anne Clifford countiffe 
" dowager of Pembrooke, Dorfett, and Montgomery, in the year 1663; 
ff who allfoe endowed the lame with lands which (he purchafed in Cawtley near 
" Sedberg.h, to the yearly value of eleaven pounds forever." â€” This eftate 
(he gave tor maintenance of a perfon qualified to read prayers and the homilies 
of the church of England, and to teach the children of Mallerftang dale to read 
and write Englifb, in the chapel there.
The ancient falary is about 3/ ioj yearly.
And in the year 17 14, Thomas 
earl of Thanet gave 200/, wherewith an augmentation was procured from the 
governors of queen Anne's bounty, and an eftate purchafed in Garfdale.
And 
in 1762, the countefs dowager Grower gave 200/ (being part of a charitable 
fund of her father the faid Thomas earl of Thanet) wherewith another bounty 
was procured, and an eftate purchafed nigh Sedbergh.
And in 1772, fhe 
gave other 200 /, and thereby obtained another augmentation, wherewith an 
eitate was purchafed adjoining to the laft above mentioned.

'THE parifh of Brouoh was anciently part of the parifh of Kirkby Stephen, 
â– *â–  even as Grefmere and Windermere were parts of the parilli of Kendal.
For 
parifhes in England were not fet out all at once, but the boundaries became 
afcertained by ufage, or fpecial agreement, or the extent fometimes of the 
founder's eftate.
Ivo de Talebois gave the church of Kirkby Stephen to the abbot and con- 
vent of St. Mary's York : The faid abbot and convent granted the advowfon 
of the vicarage of Kirkby Stephen to the bilhop of Carlifle and his fucceffors : 
And the bilhops, in confequence thereof, claimed alio the patronage of the 
chapel of Burgh.
On the other hand, Robert de Veteripont* having obtained a grant of Appleby 
and Burgh, with their appurtenances (cum appendiciis, with their appendages) ' t 
his pofterity claimed the patronage of Brough, as appendant to the manor.
A third claim was put in by the crown, afferting that the patronage thereof 
had never pafled out of the crown by virtue of the faid grant, but that it ftill 
remained in the crown.
To this purpofe there is a very notable record*, in the 15 Ed. 1.
On an 
aflife of Darrein prefentment, the king claimed the prefentation againft Ifabella 
and Idonea, daughters and heirs of Kobert de Veteripont; fetting forth, that 
king Henry the third, father of the prefent king, prefented laft to the church 
one William de Clifford, by whofe cefllon the church is now vacant.
The faid 
Ifabella and Idonea on their own behalf fet forth, that the manor of Burgh, 
with divers lands there, did heretofore belong to Hugh de Morvil, who for- 
feited the fame, and thereupon they came into the hands of king Henry the 
fecond ; and after his death, into the hands of king Richard (the firft), who 
prefented one Thomas Bowet : After king Richard's death, the fame came 
into the hands of king John; who granted to Robert de Veteripont, anceftor 
of the faid Ifabella and Idonea, Appleby and Burgh, with all their appurte- 
nances : That to the faid Robert de Veteripont fucceeded his fon John: That 
the faid John de Veteripont dying, his fon Robert (father of the faid Ifabella 
and Idonea) being then under age and in cuflody of king Henry the third, 
and the church then becoming vacant, the faid king Henry the third prefented 
thereto one Peter de Chamberi : That the (aid Robert de Veteripont dying, 
and the church then again becoming vacant by the death of the faid Peter de 
Chamberi, the faid llabella and Idonea being then under age and in cuftody 
of the faid king; he the faid king Henry the third, in the name of his faid 
wards, did prefent one William de Clifford, by whofe ceflion the church is

John being then in his hands, together with the advowfon of the church afore- 
faid, by a grant from the faid king until the faid Robert fhould be of full age, 
oppofed himfelf to the faid prefentation ; and that the faid king by his letters 
dilclaimed any thing to himfelf by virtue thereof, but only in the name of 
the faid Robert : And in like manner, on the fecond prefentation by the faid 
king, Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leyburn having the cuflody of the 
lands of the laid Ifabella and Idonea by a like grant from the crown until they 
mould come of age, the faid king by his letters teftified, that they gave their 
affent to the faid prefentation for that turn, faving to them their right when 
the church fhould again become vacant : And thereupon the faid Ifabella and 
Idonea, by virtue of the faid grant from king John, who gave to the faid 
Robert de Veteripont the faid manor and lands with all their appurtenances, 
infill upon their right to prefent â€¢, becaufe the advowfon, though not fpecially 
mentioned in the grant, was appendant to the faid manor.
But by the court: 
Forafmuch as in the faid grant no mention is made of the advowfon, but only 
Burgh with its appurtenances ; in fuch grant of the king, it is prefumed, that 
he retained to himfelf the advowfon, and did not grant the fame.
And judg- 
ment was given for the king.
Which judgment is very remarkable ; and proceeds upon the diflin&ion, 
that all hough in the cafe of a common perfon the grant of a manor with the 
appurtenances pafleth an advowfon appendant to fuch manor, yet in the cafe of 
the king it is otherwife, and the advowfon doth not pafs without being fpe- 
cially named.
And this fhews, that the flatute of Prercgativa Regis made in 
the next king's reign (17 Ed. 2.
c. 15.) was not introductory of a new law as 
to this matter, but only declaratory of what the law was before : Which en- 
afteth, that " When our lord the king giveth or granteth land or a manor 
*Â« with the appurtenances, without he make exprefs mention in his deed or 
'Â« writing of knights fees, advowfons of churches, and dowers when they fall, 
" belonging to fuch manor or land, then at this day the king referveth to 
" himfelf fuch fees, advowfons, and dowers ; albeit that among other perfons 
" it hath been obferved otherwife." 
And in puifuance of the aforefaid judgment, the crown continued in pof- 
feflion of this advowfon (though not without further conteft both by the 
bimop and the poflerity of the faid Robert) until king Edward the third, at 
the inftance of his chaplain Robert Eglesfield, who was re&or of this church 
and founder of Queen's College in Oxford, granted the fame to the faid col- 
lege ; in the patronage of which college it ftill continues.
The parifn of Brough is bounded on the Eaft by the parifhes of Romaldkirk 
and Bowes in the county of York â€¢, on the South, by the parim of Kirkby 
Stephen â€¢, on the Weft, by the parim of Mufgrave; and on the North, by the 
faid parifh of Romaldkirk â€¢.
And contains about 210 families, all of the church

The church is dedicated to St. Michael; and is a vicarage, valued in the 
king's books at 8 / 18 s yd.
r The 
S 66 PARISH OF BROUGH.
The fuccefuon of incumbents, fo far as we have any account, hath been as 
follows : 
So early as the reign of king Richard the firft, we have found Thomas Bowet y 
prefented by that king, as in poflcflion of the advowfon after the forfeiture 
of Sir Hugh deMorvil; and without any oppofition, fo far as appears, from 
the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, to whom the church of Kirkby 
Stephen did then belong.
But during the incumbency of Thomas Bowet, we 
find a difpute between the faid abbot and convent on one part, and Walter 
Malclerk bifhop of Carlifle on the other part, concerning the church of Kirkby 
Stephen ; which was referred to the prior of Carliile and other arbitrators, who 
awarded, that the church of Kirkby Stephen with all its appurtenances (namely, 
the chapel of Burgh with its appurtenances, and if there be any other which 
ought to be called chapels) fhall be ceded to the faid abbey-, that after the 
ceflion or death of Thomas Bowet, the chapel of Burgh fhall accrue to its 
mother church of Kirkby Stephen, without any impediment of the bifhop of 
Carlifle.
Hov/ever, in the next bifhop's time, in the year 1248, which was the 34th 
year of king Henry the third, the abbot and convent (fo far as concerned the 
difpute between them and the bifhop) granted to Silvefter bilhop of Carlifle 
and his fucceflbrs the advowfon of the church of Burgh.
Neverthelefs, the bifhop's claim did not take place ; for on the death of 
Thomas Bowet, the faid king Henry the third prefented the aforefaid Peer de 
Chatyberi, Robert de Veteripont fon of John being then under age and the 
king's ward, though the king had granted the cuffody of the lands of the faid 
Robert to the bifhop as aforefaid.
On the death of Peter de Chamberi, the faid kitag Henry the third pre- 
fented William de Clifford; the two daughters and coheirs of the faid Robert 
being then under age, and the king's wards.
On the ceflion of the faid William de Clifford, the right of prefentation was 
contefted as aforefaid between king Edward the firft and the faid two daugh- 
ters of Robert de Veteripont ; which ended in favour of the king's title.
And 
John de Langton feems to have been then prefented by the king.
For in the 
33 h.d 1.
John de Langton, reclor of Burgh, refigns his living, on being made 
bilhop of Chichefter-, and thereupon the king prefented Hugh de Burgh, and 
Robert de Clifford (knight prefented l-Filliam de Corby.
On a jus patrcnatus 
iflued, the jurors fay, that the church is vacant by the resignation of John now 
bilhop of Chichefter, j that the king laft prefented the faid John to the faid 
church-, that the faid church is penfionary to the bifhop of Carlifle in 20s 
yearly-, that concerning the right of patronage they are in doubt ; for that 
Adam de Ulvefby, fleward of the bifhop, appeared in taking the inquifition, 
and produced a charter of the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York, which 
teftifieth, that the faid abbot and convent had granted the patronage of the 
faid church to Silvefter bifhop of Carlifle and his fucceflbrs -, and that Nicholas 
de Grendon, bailiff of the faid Robert de Clifford, appeared alio, and pro- 
pounded ore tenus in the name of the laid Robert, that he the faid Robert is

the true patron, for that king John granted to the anceftor of the faid Robert 
the manor of Burgh with the appurtenances.
The re fu it was, that Hugh de 
Burgh, the king's prefentee, was inftituted.
The next incumbent feems to have been William de Northwick.
For on the 
death of William de Northwick, rector of Burgh, in the 8 Ed. 3.
1332, the 
king prefented the above mentioned Robert de Eglesfield; which Robert was 
founder of Queen's college in Oxford as aforeiaid, for the education and 
emolument chiefly of perfons born within the two counties of Weftmorland 
and Cumberland : a mod beneficial inftitution, as thofe two counties above all 
others were over run with ignorance and barbarifm, occafioned by the per- 
petual hoftilities which exifted between the neighbouring bordeiers on both 
fides ; and which hath been productive of infinite advantage, not only to the 
faid two counties, but to the kingdom in general, in furnifhing many able and 
learned men for the fervice both of church and (late.
In honour of whofe 
memory, we have thought fit to lay together all that hath occurred to us con- 
cerning the family of Eglcsfield.
They were of Eglesfield [bagles-field], a 
fmall village in Cumberland, from whence they derived their furname.
So eatly as the reign of king Henry the third, we find in the 44th year of 
that king, a fuit at law, between Adam Ion of Richard de Eglesfield plaintiff, and 
Henry de Eglesfield defendant, concerning a mill in Eglesfield: which implies, 
that the family were then lords of the manor ; for the mills generally in an- 
cient time belonged to the lords of manors, being erected by them for the 
ufe of their tenants â€¢, and it fee met h, that the tenant, without the lord's per- 
miffion, could not erect a mill â€¢, moft of the tenants being bound by their te- 
nure to grind their corn at the lord's mill.
The next account that we have is in the 1 Ed. 3.
in which we find, that 
Robert de Eglesfield held the manor of Ravenfwyke.
And this probably is the 
fame Robert de Eglesfield [or, as the name is fpelt in the bifhop's regifler, 
Eglesfield,] of whom we now fpeak.
Dr. Todd fays, he was fon of John Eglefi- 
field by Beatrix his wife â€¢, which probably may be true: but he doth not cite 
his vouchers.
As to the other particulars here mentioned, we have undoubted 
authority ; the fame being extracted from the Efcheators books for Cumber- 
land, as copied by Mr. Denton.
In the 11 Ed. 3.
there was a grant of free warren to Robert Eglesfield^ in the 
manors of Eglesfield, Dregg, and Ravenwyke.
In the 14 Ed. 3.
it is found by inquifition, that Robert Eglesfield, granted the 
hamlet of Ravenwyke to the provoft and fcholars of Queen's college \_Aulee 
Regina\ in Oxford, holden of the king in capite, by homage and fealty and 
the rent of zs Sd to be paid yearly into the exchequer at Carlifie.
And the 
inquifition further finds, that the faid Robert held 40 marks of land and rent 
in the manors of Eglesfield and Dregg, of Anthony Lucy (lord of Cocker- 
mouth) by fealty and 6 s 8 d yearly.
In the 32 Ed. 3.
John, Eglesfield [heir general, probably, of the family] in- 
feoffed Roger Kirkbride and John Browne chaplains in lands at Langholme, 
Caftle Carrock, Gamellbie, Cringledyke, Hetherford, Burgh, Crookdaik, 
Eglesfield, Newton, and Kirkbampton, to the ufe of John his fon and heir.
In 
568 PARISH OF BROUGH.
In the 3 5 Ed. 3.
John de Eglesfield appears to have been lord of Langholme, 
and to have had lands at Crookdaik, hglesfield, and Kirkbampton.
In the 39 Ed. 3.
John de Eglesfield held the manor of Eglesfield, by homage, 
and 6 s 8d cornage-, the extended value thereof being ten marks.
In the 44 Ed. 3.
Maud widow of John deRibbeton held lands in Eglesfield, 
of John de Eglesfield lord thereof.
In the 22 Ric. 2.
John Eglesfield held in free tenancy the manor of Eglef- 
field, of the caftle and manor of Cockermouth, by the fervice of 6s 8d.
In the 9 Hen. 8.
Gawin Eglesfield efquire was high fheriff of the county of 
Cumberland.
In the 34 Hen. 8.
from a general feodary for Cumberland, compiled in that 
year from the rolls of the court of wards and liveries, it appears, that Richard 
Eglesfield then held the manor of Eglesfield of our lord the king as of his caftle 
of Cockermouth, by homage and fealty, and 6s 8d cornage.
and the fervice 
of witnefman in five villages to be performed; that he held alfothe manor and 
village of Alingburghte ; and divers meffuages, lands, and tenements in 
Dreigg in Coupland in the faid county of Cumberland, of the king as of his 
caftle of Egremont, by knights fervice, homage, fealty, fuit of court, 6s Sd 
cornage, and 12 d for feawake, and puture of the ferjeants.
In the 5 Ed. 6.
Richard Eglesfield efquire was high fheriff of the faid county 
of Cumberland.
And this is the laft of the name and family that we have 
found at Eglesfield *.
The faid Robert de Eglesfield, on his prefentation to the rectory of Burgh, 
was inftituted in the perfon of Adam de Eglesfield his proxy.
He was ordained 
prieft in the cathedral church of Carlifle in Lent following.
The right of pre- 
fentation, at this vacancy, was contefted by Robert de Clifford in the courts at 
"Weftminfter, and judgment given for the king.
In 1342, the profits of the 
rectory were fequeftred by the bifhop, for the non-refidence of the faid Robert 
de Eglesfield \ whereupon the king fent a writ of relaxation, the faid Robert 
being employed in attendance upon the king's perfon.
In the year 1344, the church was appropriated, by pope Clement the fixth, 
to the provoft and fcholars cf the faid college â€¢, and an account was then taken 
of the value of the living, which was then rated at 53/ 16 s yd y though in the 
time of William de Northwick (the inquifiticn lays) it was fometimes worth 
ico/ a year: whereof the vicar was endowed with the manfe and glebe, with 
lands at Helbeck, the tithes of hay of Helbeck and Sourby, Great Burgh and 
Little Burgh (the tithes of hay of Staynefmore being excepted, which were 
to remain to the college); the tithes of mills, milk, calves, colts, and pre- 
fcriptions for the fame; the tithes cf flax, hemp, Lent fines, mortuaries, ob- 
lations, obventions, and all fmall tithes (except the tithes of wool and lamb).
The vicar to fuftain all charges ordinary and extraordinary, and to pay the 
penfion of 20 s yearly to the bifhop, and to maintain the roof of the chancel.
The -next after Robert Eglesfield that we find was John Rainold, vicar of 
Burgh ; who in the year 1369 made an exchange with John de Merton vicar of 
* For a lift of the prcvofts of Queen's college, fee the Appendix, NÂ«I1I.
St.
PARISH OF BROUGH.
St. Michael's Appleby; and the provoft and fcholars thereupon prefented the 
faid John de Merton to the vicarage of Brough.
Ihe next that we have found was of the name of Raijbeck; who in the year 
15c 6 oppofed the eftablifhing of a chapel at Brough, as will appear.
. The next that hath occurred to us is Ihcmas Rigg, whofe epitaph was depicted 
in cne of the windows in the chancel, legible in bifhop Nicolfon's time all but 
the date : "Orate pro anima magiftri Thorns: Ryge, quondam vicarii iftius 
" ecclefise; et pro animabus parentum, bencfactorum, parochianorum fuorum, 
" ac omnium fidelium defunclorum : Quorum animabus propitietur Deus." 
He appears to have been living in 1532.
In the year 1537, 28 Hen. 8.
after Afk's rebellion in that year, we find a 
vicar of Brough, but his name is not mentioned, in a letter from the duke of 
Norfolk to the king " Aglianby, I doubt not, or now hath fhewed your 
'* highnes what was done att Carlifle.
And thoughe none were quartered, 
" becaufe I knewe not your pleafure therein before ; yett all the threeicore and 
M fourteene be hanged in cheaines or ropes uppon gallowes or trees, in all fuche

And alfo I have for 
" doclor Towneley, fend doubt not within three daies to have them both with 
" me, and foe fhall fend them up f." 
In 1568, we find Lancelot Shaw, M.
A. vicar of Brough.
In 1594, Roger Salkeld, M.
A. was prefented by the provoft and fcholars, on 
the death of Lancelot Shaw.
In 161 1, David Heck/letter, S.
T. B.
was inftituted, on the death of Roger 
Salkeld.
In 1623, on David Heckfletter's death, William Richardfon, S.
T. B.
was 
inftituted.
In 1664, Chriftopher Earrifon, M.
A. was inftituted, on the prefentation of 
the provoft and fcholars.
In 1695, Jofeph Fijher, M.
A. was inftituted, on the death of Chriftopher 
Harrifon.
He was afterwards archdeacon of Carlifle.
In 1703, on the death of Jofeph Filher, Francis Thomfon % S.
T. B.
was in- 
ftituted; who died in the year 1735.
His wife, who was widow of the faid 
Jofeph Fifher, died two years after him.
They had two fons ; the elder, John 
Thomfon efquire, now one of his majefty's juftices of the peace for the county 
of Weftmorland : The younger fon, William Thomfon, M.
A. late fellow of 
the faid college, rector of Southwelton and Hampton Poyle in the county of 
Oxford, was author of a volume of elegant poems publifhed in the year 1757.
The faid William Thomfon caufed two epitaphs to be ingraved in the chancel 
of Brough church in memory of his parents; which, being much above the

of the perfons defcribed, are here inferred :

The church at Brough is a pretty large handfome ancient building.
The 
Jleeple is not fo old; having been built about the year 1513, under the direc- 
tion of Thomas Blenkinfop of Helbeck efquire.
There are in it four excel- 
lent bells, by much the largeft in the county, except the great bell at 
Kirkby Thore.
Concerning thefe bells at Brough, there is a tradition, 
that they were given by one Brim/Idll, who lived upon Stanemore, in the re- 
moteft part of the parifh, and had a great many cattle.
One time it hap- 
pened that his bull fell a bellowing, which in the dialect of the country is 
called criming (this being the genuine Saxon word to denote that vociferation).
Whereupon he faid to one of his neighbours, Hearefl: thou how loud this bull 
crunes ?
If thefe cattle fhould all crune together, might they not be heard 
from Brough hither ?
He anfwered, Yea. Well then, fays Brunfkill, I'll make 
them all crune together.
And he fold them all ; and with the price thereof he 
bought the faid bells : (Or perhaps he might get the old bells new caft and 
made larger.) â€” There is a monument in the body of the church, in the fouth 
wal 1 , between the higheft and fecond windows , under which it is faid the faid 
Brunfkill was the lalt that was interred.
At the fouth end of the communion table is this infeription: " Here lyes 
" Mr. Gabriel Vincent, ftuart to the right honourable Anne Clifford, countefs 
" dowager of Pembroke, Dorfet, and Montgomery, and chief director of 
" all her buildings in the north â€¢, who died in the Roman tower of Brough 
" caftle, like a good chriftian, the 12th of February 1665, looking for the 
" lecond coming of our faviour Jefus Chrift." 
The pulpit is of ftone.
There was heretofore an handfome reading dejk, 
given by Sir Cuthbert Buckle knight, vintner in London, who was born upon 
Stanemore in this pariOi, and was lord mayor of London in the year 1593.
His name was upon the defk thus: " By Cuthbert Buckle, Anno Domini 
" 1576." â€” He alio built a bridge upon Stanemore, which ftill bears the name 
of Buckle's bridge ; and gave 8 / a year to a fchool upon Stanemore.
There was a chantry in this church founded in king Henry the third's time, 
by Thomas fon of Thomas de Mufgrave â€¢, who granted certain lands and te- 
nements to God and S:.
Mary the virgin and to his chapel of Burgh under 
Stanemore, and to Sir William de Afkcby chaplain, and his fuccefTors ferving 
God there, whom he and his heirs fhould prefent to the faid chapel.
To which 
grant was witnefs (amongft.
others) Sir Michael de Harclay.
Bjt it feemeth that the prefentation to this chantry was foon after transferred 
to the family of Helbeck.
For in the next king's reign, 19 Ed. 1.
Thomas 
de Hellebeck prefented Sir Eudo de Appleby to the chantry in the town of 
Burgh, which had been founded and endowed, by Sir Thomas Mufgrave knight, 
and unto which the faid Thomas prefented William de Afkeby.

little quire, called the clofet, which belonged to the Bltnkinfops of Helbeck ; 
for the erecting of which, Thomas Blenkinlbp efquire by his will in 1522 
gave four marks, and alfo lime and ocher neceffaries.
The painting in the windows of this church hath in former times been very 
extraordinary.
The reverend Thomas Machel, who had a peculiar tafte that

At the further Brough, there was a chapel or oratory, founded by John 
Brunfkill (probably the fame who gave the bells) in 1506.
Unto whom, 
Thomas Blenkinfop efquire of Helbeck gave the ground called Gibgarth, on 
condition that he mould build a chapel there-, and alfo an hofpital, with two 
beds in it for travellers and other poor people â€¢, and maintain and repair the

fame for ever : paying to him and his heirs 2 d rent at Pentecoft yearly.
And 
on defect of fuch maintaining and repairing the laid chapel, hofpital, and 
beds j the land to revert to the faid Thomas and his heirs.
In purfuance whereof, he the faid John Brunfkill founded an oratory or 
chapel, dedicated to cur lady St. Mary the mother of Chrift, and to St. Ga- 
briel the archangel ; who, as Roger bifhop of Carlifie and Richard abbot of 
Shap did by writing under their hands and ieals affirm, wrought many fair and 
divers miracles by the fufferance of our lord God. Two pricfts were efta- 
blifhed to fing and to pray in the faid chapel for evermore, for the fouls of all the 
benefactors of the faid chapel that were departed from the world, and for the 
welfare of them that were living.
One of the faid priefts was to teach gram- 
mar, the other to inftruct children willing to learn finging, freely without any 
falary from them.
The foundation of this chapel was confirmed both by the 
bifhop of Carlifie and the archbifhop of York \ and yet was afterwards op- 
poied by the vicar of Burgh, who conceived himfelf much prejudiced thereby, 
and particularly in refpect of the oblations which were given from him to the 
faid chapel.
Whereupon he let up the crofs, and lighted up candles in the 
church at mid-time of the day, caufed the bells to be rung, and curfed with 
bell book and candle all thofe that fhould receive any oblations of them that 
reforted to the faid chapel, or fhould give any encouragement unto the fame.
Brunfkill the founder complained to the archbifhop's court at York againft the 
vicar Mr. Rafebeck, and obtained a fharp citation againft him, cenfuring him 
as an abandoned wretch and inflated with diabolical venom for oppofing fo 
good a work.
Notwithstanding which, Mr. Rafebeck appealed to the pope ; 
and an agreement was made between the founder and him, by a compofition 
of 20 j yearly to be paid to Mr. Rafebeck and his fucceffors vicars of Burgh.
Thus the chapel continued till the diflolution of the religious houfes.
And 
the prieft that taught to fing being removed, the other that taught grammar 
â€¢was thought fit to be continued as mafter of a free fchool.
And by the com- 
rnifijoners Sir Walter Mildmay and Robert Keylway efquire, order was taken, 
and a fund fettled for this purpofe.
So that a falary of 7/ \is qd was to be 
paid yearly to the mafter of the fchool by the king's auditors, they receiving 
all the rents and revenues which formerly belonged unto it as a chapel, and 
which were given to it by the founder and other benefactors.
This is all the endowment which it hath at prelent, except a convenient 
dwelling houfe and garden, which were given by one of the fchool mafters Mr.
John Beck.
But it was formerly very bountifully endowed by feveral bene- 
factors ; as Henry earl of Cumberland, Edward Mufgrave of Hartley efquire, 
William Mufgrave fon of Richard Mufgrave of Brough, Thomas Blenkinfop 
efquire, Hugh Newton, and divers others, who gave lands in Brough, Stane- 
more, Moreton, Yanewith, Mekil-Strickland, Bampton Cundale, and Mekil- 
Afhby, all in Weflmorland ; and in Penrith in Cumberland â€¢> and Weft Laton 
in Yorkfhire ; and Bernard-caftle in the county of Durham.
The governor thereof, whilft a chapel, was the abbot of Shap for the time 
being.
Since the diffolution, that power feems to be in the king.
5 In 
PARISH OF BROUGH.
S75 
In the years 1527 and 1532, there are two acquittances from Thomas Rige 
vicar of Burgh, for the half yearly payment of joj compofition money paid 
to him by the abbot of Shap commendatary of the chapel of St. Mary in the 
parifh of Burgh.
By which it feemeth, that the abbot himfelf then held the 
chapel in commendam.
At the dilfolution, the valuation thereof, as appears from the Valor in the 
firft fruits office, was as follows : " The grammar fchool of Burgh is worth, 
" in a manfion houfe with divers tenements and burgages in the town of Burgh 
â€¢* 1 19 s iod; one tenement in the town of Laton upon the moor 20^20^1 
" one tenement in the town of Bernard -caftle 18 s: In the whole 7/ igs 6d.
â€” 
" Reprifes : A free rent yearly paid to the earl of Cumberland, five pence 
" and half a farthing.
" The finging fchool of Burgh is worth in rents and farms of divers bur- 
" gages in the town of Burgh io;-, one tenement in the town of Mauldes 
" Meburne us: In the whole, 2 1 s.
In oblations within the chapel of St.
" Mary Burgh 79 s.
Total 100 s." 
By which it may feem, that there had been fome embezilments or aliena- 
tions, perhaps by the worthy governors the abbots, of which they feem to 
have been capable enough, as we have found one of them lblemnly certifying 
miracles to have been performed in the faid chapel, another in all probability 
holding the chapel himfelf.
Or perhaps they might draw to the abbey fuch of 
the revenues as were moll convenient, as at Yanwath, Strickland, Bampton, 
and Afby.
Oppofite to the crofs, in the faid further Brough, on the right hand as one 
goes towards Scanemore, behind a houfe, was a well covered over with a mil- 
ftone, at the eye of which they took up the water, which was called St. Mary's 
(or St. Winifred's *) well.
Perhaps it got the name of St. Mary's after found- 
ing of the chapel.
Many came hither on pilgrimage in the times of popery,.
and the vicar of Burgh had a diploma from the pope (the aforefaid Chrifto- 
pher Harrifon the vicar faid he had ieen it) to receive the oblations of all pil- 
grims there.
Which oblations, by reafon of the vicinity of the chapel, and 
the diftance from the mother church, would be likely to fall into the hands of 
the chaplain.
And this might be one principal reafon of the vicar's oppofing 
the eftablifhment of a chapel there.
There is now no chapel in the parifh of Brough, except only the chapel of 
Stanemore.
In the year 1594, Cuthbert Buckle aforefaid by his laft will and.
teftament gave an annuity of 8/ charged upon his eftate at Spittle, towards 
the maintenance of a fchoolmafier at Stanemore, to be employed in teaching 
children to read, write, cypher, and caft account.
The heir at law contested 
the devife, but in 1600 a decree was obtained in favour of the fchool, and the 
heir was required to convey the faid annuity to truftees for the ufe of the 
fchool.
The inhabitants erected a fchoolhoufe at their own expence, and pur-

rifon the then vuar.

s7 6 PARISH OF BROUGH.
chafed three roods of land for liberty for the fcholars.
After the building of 
the fchoolhoufe, the fame (in confideration of the great diftance from the 
parifh church) was conlecrated by bifhop Robinfon in the year 1608, and be- 
came a chapel, in which the fchoolmafter was to officiate as curate on Sundays 
and holidays, as well as to teach the children on the other days.
Afterwards, 
in the year 1699, Thomas earl of Thanet repaired the chapel, and built a 
fchoolhoufe near adjoining.
He inclofed alfo a large parcel of wafte ground, 
called Slape Stones, then of the yearly value of 10/ or thereabouts, and 
granted the fame to 14 perfons in trull that the rents and profits of the faid 
clofe be paid to the fchoolmafter and curate as an augmentation of his former 
falary of 8/.
The faid fchoolmafter and curate to be appointed by the faid 
earl, his heirs and affigns, lords and owners of the manor of Brough.
When 
fix truftees die, the furvivors are to chufe others.
There is to be no fervice 
at the chapel in the afternoon on Eafter day, but the inhabitants are to repair 
to the mother church, and there hear divine fervice, and receive the facrament.
And in the forenoon of every firft Sunday in May, June, July, and Auguft, 
there (hall be no fervice in the chapel, but the inhabitants fhall repair to the 
mother church.
The faid earl gave 200/, with which, together with the augmentation by 
queen Anne's bounty of other 200/, an eftate was purchafed at Raifgill hall 
in the parifli of Orton, for the ufe of the curate.
And the countefs dowager Gower, one of the daughters of the faid earl, 
gave 200/, with which and with 2Co/of queen Anne's bounty, an eftate was 
purchafed nigh the chapel, and infranchifed by the prefent earl in 1762.
The truftees of the Slape Stones pafture took it in their heads to keep the 
fame in their own polTefilon, defcending (as it were) from father to fon, and 
paid to the curate 10/ or 12/ a year, and afterwards advanced to the prefent 
curate 15/ a year; and on a bill filed againft them in the chancery in the year 
1764 in the name of the attorney general at the relation of the prefent earl of 
Thanet the patron and James Fenton curate, they fwore in their anfwer they 
believed it was not worth more.
In the end, in the year 1770, it was decreed, 
that they fhould deliver up polTelTion to the curate, who immediately advanced 
the pafture to 35 /a year, although under the difcouragement of having gates 
broken down, cattle killed or maimed, and other enormities committed in the 
night-time ; and it is now let at 38/ a year.
And a new fet of truftees was ap- 
pointed by the court.
John Bracken, curate of the chapel, by his will in 1754, gave 20/, the in- 
tereft whereof to be applied for repairing and finding books for the chapel ; 
5/, the intereft whereof is to be given yearly to poor houfholders within the 
chapelry ; and 5 /, whereof the intereft is to be applied to purchafe books for 
poor children at the fchool.
There is alfo a poor ftock belonging to the parilh of Brough, of about 67 L 
Of which, 50/ was given by Mr. Richard Bovel of London ; the reft was con- 
tributed by others in fmall funis.

OF THE MANORS OF BROUGH, STANEMORE, 
AND SOWERBY.
Thefe three manors having continued all along in the hands of the Veteri- 
ponts, Cliffords, and their defcendents, and never been granted off to any- 
inferior lords i what we have to fay concerning one, will generally be appli- 
cable to them all.
All Stanemore is not in the parifh of Brough.
South Stanemore is in the 
parifh of Kirkby Stephen ; and the molt eaftern part of it is in the parifh of 
Bowes in Yorkfhire, the boundary of the two counties being alfo the boundary 
of the parifhes.
Brough is commonly exprefled by the defcription of Brough under Stanemore* 
to diftinguifh it from other places of the fame name, of which there are many.
It is commonly divided into two parts, which anciently were denominated Over 
Brough and Under Brough, Great Brough and Little Brough, but now molt 
commonly Church Brough and Market Brough.
This place was the Vertera of the Romans, where in the decline of the em- 
pire a Roman captain refided, with a band of the Direflores.
But now the 
name is turned into Brough, or more properly Burgh.
For (to note it once 
for all) in the time of the later emperors, little caftles, meet for warlike oc- 
cafions, and furnifhed with (lore of corn and other provifions, began to be 
termed Burgi, by a new name, which, after the empire was tranflated into the 
eaft, the Germans and others ieem to have borrowed of the Greek word 
n.vpy(&.
Hence alfo came the name of Burgundians, becaufe they inhabited 
Burghs, for fo in that age they ufed to call thofe dwelling places which were 
planted here and there along limits and marches.
That this Burgh was Vertera, there feemeth to be no doubt â€¢, becaufe the 
diftance thereof from Lavatr<e (which is Bowes) of the one fide, and from 
Brovacum (which is Brougham) of the other fide, being reduced into Italian 
miles, doth exaclly agree with Antoninus's meafures-, and for that the Roman 
way leadeth through this place from Bowes to Brougham.
From Brough to Bowes eaflward, the road leadeth over the ridge of fells 
already mentioned.
And, to fee the difference of times, it is curious to ob- 
iVrve how Sir Daniel Fleming defcribed the fame not ioo years ago (no doubt, 
from his own experience) : " Here," fays he, " beginneth to rife that high, 
" hilly, and folitary country, expofed to wind and rain, which becaufe.
it is 
" Jiony is called in our native language Stane-moor â€¢, over which is a great (but 
" no good) road, the poll paffing twice every week betwixt Burgh and Bowes, 
ct and coaches going often that way, though with fome difficulty and hazard 
" of overturning and breaking.
All here round about is nothing but a wild 
*' defert, unlefs it be an homely hoftelry or inn, in the very midfr.
thereof, 
" called the Spittle on Stanemore, for to entertain wayfaring people." The 
badnefs of the road (which perhaps was indeed the worft hard road in Eng- 
land) contributed to render all the reft more difmal j and in ftormy weather it

was the more vexatious, as the traveller could make no fpeed.
But now, 
from fome of the worft, it is by reafon of the turnpike road carried that way 
become nearly as good as the beft road in the kingdom.
And (to note the 
improvement of commerce and correfpondence) inttead of twice a week, the 
port goes fix times a week to and from Brough.
The Spittle aforefaid was a charitable inftitution, and belonged to Marryke 
abbey in Yorkfhire ; and after the difTolution, the tenants thereof applied it 
to the purpofe of an inn.
But fince the turnpike road was made, it is be- 
come ufelefs in that refpect, as there is no need for the traveller to halt 
between Brough and Bowes ; for whereas before it took up fix hours in tra- 
velling thirteen miles, the fame can now be performed with more eafe in an 
hour and an half.
Spittle houfe is in Yorkfhire.
On the top of Stanemore, on the Weftmoreland fide, is the fragment of a 
crofs, which we call Rerecrofs (Rear crojs, a crofs reared or fet up), and which 
the Scots call Roycrofs, as much as to fay, the King's crofs ; which Hector 
Boetius the Scotifh writer recordeth to have been erected as a mear ftone or 
boundary between England and Scotland, what time as king William the 
conqueror granted Cumberland unto the Scots, on this condition, that they 
fhould hold it of him as his tenants, and not attempt any thing prejudicial or 
hurtful to the crown of England.
A little lower, upon the Roman way, ftood a fmall fquare fort of the 
Romans, which at this day is called Maiden-caftle.
From whence, it is re- 
ported, the faid highway went, with many windings, along what was called the 
Maiden ivay> as far as to Caervorran in Northumberland.
In the reign of king Henry the third, we find one Adam de Slegill forejler 
of Stainmore, under the Veteriponts.
After the death of John de Veteripont, during the long minority of his 
fon Robert, we find an account of great wafte committed or fuffered by the 
prior of Carlifle, to whom the king had granted the cuftody of the faid 
Robert, after Adam de Slegill had left the foreftry of Stanemore.
And, 
amongft the reft, Item, the tower of Burgh is decayed, and the joifts 
are rotten, and moft part of the houfe is brought to nought, by default of the 
prior keeping the fame.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, it was found bjr 
inquifition, that the faid Robert, on the day on which he died, held the cattle

the vaccaries of Knolhow, Skrythergill, Calfhowelade, Aldpark, Swynfty- 
wath, Mouthowlake, Thornethowegayll, Burghway, Severyg, Strykefcales,

vill of Soureby, parcel of the faid caftle and manor; and the fervices of divers 
tenants of Great Burgh and Little Burgh, who paid to her yearly 10 s.
The caftle, in the year 152 t, was by cafualty fet on fire, two years before 
the death of Henry lord Clifford, furnamed the Shepherd, a little while after 
he had kept a great chriftmafs there, fo as nothing was left but the bare 
walls.
And fo it lay, till rebuilt by the lady Anne Clifford, countefs dow- 
ager of Dorfet, Pembroke, and Montgomery, in the year 1661.
The roof of the old tower had been contrived, not raifed in the middle, 
to throw the water out at the fides, but higheft at the extremities, with a 
gutter in the middle, to receive the rain water.
And the lower windows or lights in the tower are framed with a turn in 
the wall, fo as to let in the light, but to prevent an arrow fhot from without 
from flying in a direct line ; fo that a perlbn on the infide might ftand facing

This tower, except the bare walls, was demoliflied, and the timber fold, 
by Thomas earl of Thanet, about the year 1695, when he was repairing 
Appleby caftle; and the whole caftle of Brough now lies totally in ruins.

Robert lord Clifford, in the 4 Ed. 3.
obtained of that king a charter for 
a market, upon Thurfday every week at his manor of Burgh under Stanemore; 
and a fair yearly, to continue for four days, viz.
two days before the feaft of 
St. Matthew, on that feaft day, and the day next following.
Which charter 
king Edward the fixth, in the third year of his reign, by Infpeximus con- 
firmed.

called Brongh hill (though not for four days, but for two of thole days annu- 
ally) is very remarkable for the fale of large numbers and quantities of cattle, 
horfes, cloth, hardware, fhoes, faddles, and many other forts of merchandife.
III.
MANOR OF HELBECK.
Helbeck, by a kind of delicacy of the modern proprietors, is flyled 
Hilbeck, as if fo denominated from the hills adjacent.
But it was of ancient 
time invariably written tiellebeck ; not from any infernal idea (for it isapleafant 
fituation enough), but from the water pouring down, expreffed by the Saxon 
word helle, which is a word not yet out of ufe to fignify the pouring out of 
any liquid : as heling fignifies inclination or leaning afide, as when failors fay 
the (hip heeleth.
Helbeck belonged for a confiderable time to a family of that name â€¢, which 
ended in a daughter.
And this brought in the family of Blenkinfop, which 
continued there for many generations, and probably is not yet extinct, 
for there are ftill feveral of the name thereabouts; but the family fold 
the eftate a good many years ago, which after various (hiftings of owners, 
now refts in John Medcalf efquire, grandfon of Thomas Carleton late of Ap- 
pleby efquire deceafed.
The Bknkinjops were a confiderable family, and had a large colleclion of 
writings, not only relating to themfelves, but of feveral other kinds, as divers ori- 
ginals belonging to Shap abbey and other places, which as it is not known how 
they came by the fame, neither is it known what became thereof, and in all 
probability they are all now totally loft, except what hath been preferved 
thereof by copies taken and extracts made by the reverend Thomas Machel, 
who had free accefs to the fame, and whole collection therefore in that refpec"t 
is extremely valuable.
Family of Helbeck.
1. So early as the reign of king Henry the fecond, to a grant by Maud 
de Veteripont to her fon the firft Robert de Veteripont, of lands at Renegill, 
two of the witneffes were Thomas de Hellebeck and Wido (Guyj his fon.
And to a deed about the fame time of lands at Clifton by Gilbert de En- 
gain, amongft other witneffes is Sir Thomas de Hellebeck.

PARISH OF BROUGH.

2. To the aforefaid Robert de Veteripont's charter to the ahbot and 
convent of Shap, in the 13th year of king John, Wido de Hellebeck was one 
of the witneffes.
And to the grant of the advowfon of Kirkby Thore, by Adam de Kirkby 
Thore to the faid Robert de Veteripont, one witnefs (amongft the reft) was 
Guido de Hellebeck.
3. The next that we meet with was Robert de Hellebeck, probably fon 
of Guy.
To the grant of Langeton to the aforefaid Robert de Veteripont by Ada 
daughter of Talebois, one of the witneffes was Robert de Hellebeck.
Which faid Robert de Hellebeck was colle&or of the aid, in the reign of 
king Henry the third.
4. The next was Sir Thomas de Hellebeck ; who was a witnefs to a grant of 
lands at Appleby in the 36 Hen. 3.
by the fecond Robert de Veteripont 
to Richard Clerke.
This Sir Thomas held lands in Richmondfliire and Weflmorland by 
knights fervice, namely, for the fourth part of one knight's fee ; alfo by an 
exchange made, he obtained Afcom and fome lands at Suarraby, which he 
held by the like fervice.
And with him beginneth the Blenkinfop account of this family, except for 
one Hamon faid to be father of this Thomas â€¢, which rnoft probably is a 
miftake : not only becaufe the circumftance of time feems to point out this 
Thomas to be fon of Robert abovementioned, but alfo becaufe Hamon is a 
name that hath not occurred in any of the evidences of thofe times.
But from 
hence downwards, the Blenkinfop pedigree is very circumftantial, and feems 
to have been taken from their family writings.
5. Sir Thomas de Hellebeck, fon of the laft Sir Thomas, lived in the time 
of king Edward the firft.
He married Avicia daughter of Adam de Hene- 
caftre, and with her had lands in Little Stirkeland, Overton, Sunbiggin^.
Raifbeck, Cotflat, and Keldlyth.
To all which, Richard de Mufgrave quit- 
ted claim in the 29th year of that king.
He had ilfue, (1) Thomas, (2) Edmund ; who married Ifabel de Slike- 
burne, a widow, in the year 1326.
He had fome lands and privileges granted 
to him by his father in the lordfhip of Helbeck.
And he had a fon called 
Edmund.
(3) Alice, married to Robert, tldeft fon of Sir Richard, fon of 
Henry de Suleby, having for her portion no marks.
Upon which marriage, 
Sir Richard de Suleby fettled all his demeihe lands, rents, homage, and 
fervices thereunto belonging, which he had in Appleby.
(4) Alane, who 
was a clergyman, and had given by his father to him and his heirs, one 
meffuage and two oxgangs of land in Helbeck.
(5) Ifabel, married to Patri- 
cius de Caftlecaroke, who had for her portion lands at Sunbigin, Rafebeck, 
Keldelith, and Coatflat, with half of the fulling mill there.
(6) Margaret, 
married to William de Lancaflre, who had for her dower lands in Stirkeland 
jn Kendale.
6. Thomas 
SU PARISH- OF BROUGH.
(Helbeck.) 
6. Thomas de Hellebeck elded Ton of the lad Sir Thomas, by inquifition in 
the 3 Ed. 2.
appears to have then held by knights fervice Hellebeck and 
Afcum.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
he was knight of the (hire.
And this Thomas was the laft of the name in the direct male line ; having 
only a daughter Ifabella, who foon after this was married to Richard de Blenk- 
infop.
For in the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifi- 
tion finds, that Thomas de Hellebeck held a moiety of Soulby ; and that 
Richard de Blenkinfop held part of Hellebeck, and Jfabel de Slekeburne held di- 
vers tenements there.
By which it appears, that Hellebeck was then gone from Thomas de Hel- 
lebeck to Blenkinfop, in marriage with his daughter Ifabella.
The Jfabel de 
Slekeburne who had fome tenements there, was wife to Edmund aforefaid, 
younger brother of this Thomas.
And the reafon why this faid Thomas ap- 
pears to have had a moiety of Soulby, was upon account of his filler Alice as 
aforefaid having been married to Robert de Soulby, fo that Thomas held the 
fame probably as truftee upon the marriage fettlement.
The arms of Hellebeck were ; Gules, 6 annulets Or, with a bordure in- 
grailed Argent.
Family of Blenkinsop.
I. The firft of the family of Blenkinfop that came to Helbeck, by mar- 
riage of the heirefs of that houfe, was Richard de Blenkinsop, younger 
brother of Robert de Blenkinfop, unto whom Edward king of Scots gave all 
the lands and tenements of Ughtertyre with the appurtenances, to the value 
of 20 marks yearly, which had come into the hands of the faid king by the 
forfeiture of Sir John Sainclere, in the 7th year of his reign.
Thomas de Hellebeck, on the marriage of his daughter to the faid Richard, 
fettled upon them and the heirs of their bodies the whole manor of Helbeck; 
except the lands and tenements held by Ifabel de Slicburn and Edmund her 
fon, and one mefiuage in the pofTefiion of William fon of Hugh, of the 
yearly rent of 10 s, which Alan de Hellebeck paid for the lands which he 
had in the faid village.
He was coroner of Weftmoreland in the 19 Ed. 2.
He died towards the beginning of the reign of king Edward the third ; for 
in the 5th year of that king, we find the faid Ifabella ftyled widow.
They 
had ifllie, 
II.
Thomas de Blencansop, who appears to have been very young at his 
father's death, for he came not of age till the 19 Ed. 3.
his letter of attorney 
to take pofTefiion of his eftate at Helbeck being dated in that year; upon the 
feal whereof were 6 annulets within a bordure ingrailed, and writ about thus, 
S. Thome de Blencanfop.
He had illue a fon,

Overton, Soulby, and Brampton, fettled upon him and Katherine his wife..
He had the office of conftable of Brough caftle granted to him and his heirs, 
for 600 years, with all its appurtenances, eafments, and commodities, by 
Roger de Clifford lord of Weftmorland.
The grant was dated at the callle of 
Burgh on Sunday before the feaft of St. James the apoftle, in the 4 Ric. 2.
â€” 
]n the nth year of the fame king, he reprefented the county of Weftmorland 
in parliament.
IV.
William de Blenkansop efquire, fon of the laft Thomas.
He 
married Maud, daughter of Richard de Salkeld, and had then fettled upon 
them by the faid Thomas a moiety of his whole demefne in the village of 
Overton, with one place in the fame village called Raiigill hall, with 16 
tenements held by tenants at will, referving the mill and moulter - t his fon 
Robert de Blenkanfop, and Richard Talbot of Burgh, being attornies to de- 
liver pofieffion.
This fettlement was dated in the 19 Ric. 2.
In the 9 Hen. 5.
he was knight of the (hire for Weftmorland.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition 
finds, that William de Blenkenfop then held the manor of Helbeck, paying 
6 s cornage.
And he appears to have been living above 20 years after this..
V. Thomas Blenkensop efquire, fon and heir of William.
He was the 
firft who took the name without de annexed.
And about this time, to wit, 
in the reign of king Henry the fixth, it feems to have become general, to 
leave out that particle, of defignation of the place, except where by reafon of 
a vowel following it was incorporated and become part of the word, as 
Danvers, Doiley, and the like.
In the r Hen. 6.
he reprefented the county of Weftmorland in parliament, his 
father being then living j for he is ftyled Thomas fon of William Blenkenfopp.
In the 25 Hen. 6.
his father conveyed to him the fite and manor of Helbeck 
for the term of his life, paying for the fame yearly 10 marks.

Thomas Blenkinsop efquire, fon and heir of Thomas.
He had 
fettled upon him on his marriage with his wife Katharine, all the lands afore- 
faid at Overton, and certain lands in the village of Tebay, in the 33 Hen. 6.
William Birkbeck vicar of Overton, and Richard Warton chaplain, being 
truftees in the conveyance.
He appears alfo to have had lands and tenements in Kyrkeby upon Wyfke 
in Yorkfhire,.
of 40/ rent..
VII.
Thomas Blenkinsop efquire, fon and heir of Thomas and Katharine.
About the 9th year of king Edward the fourth, he married Margaret

for the building 
of St. Mary's chapel at Burgh.
By an inquifition of Quo Warranto in the 19 Hen. 7.
againft Henry lord 
Clifford, the jurors find, that Thomas Blenkinfop was ieifed of the manor of 
Helbeck 
5 8 4 PARISH OF BRO UGH.
(Helbeck.) 
Helbeck with the appurtenances in his demefne as of fee, and being fo

by homage, fealty, and fcutage, that is to fay, when fcutage runs at 40 s for 
each knight's fee, then to pay 40s-, when more, more; and when lefs, lefs; 
and by the cornage of 6s-, and by the fervice to do fuit at the court of our 
lord the king in the county of Weftmorland, from month to month, at the 
king's caftle of Appleby : And that the faid manor is worth 40/ above re- 
prifes : That the faid Thomas died in the 18th year of king Hen. 7.

together with his wife (if he fhould die before his return) executors in 
trull for his younger children.
But he returned, and lived to make another 
will.
In recompence of his good and laudable fervice to Henry earl of Cumber- 
land, warden of the weft marches towards Scotland, he was gratified, by the

By articles of marriage in the 24 Hen. 8.
it appears that

think fit.
He gave 26 s 8d towards the building of the bridge at Brough â€¢, whence it 
is, that his arms are placed thereupon, together with the Clifford's, who moft 
probably were alfo contributors thereunto.
By his will, in the 37 Hen. 8.

younger brother of a family of that name at Winton hall.
The arms of Blenkinfop were, Argent, a fefs between three garbes banded

PARISH OF MUSGRAVE.
TV/Tuscrave, without queftion, received its name from the family which 
"*â€¢'*â–  refided there for feveral ages, afterwards lemoved to Hartley caftle, and 
finally fettled and now continues at Eden- hall in Cumberland.
Mufgrave is a 
name of office.
Grave means governor, fieward, or keeper.
So the foeriff" 
is fhire-grave : and there is landgrave amongft the Germans ; pal/grave (palace- 
grave) â€¢, margrave or mark-grave, marquis, marchiarum comes, count or warden 
of the marches.
And it is generally iuppofed, that Mufegrave and Margrave 
are the fame.
But, as there is not much likenefs between the words, fo it is 
certain that this family did not receive their name from being wardens of the 
marches againft Scotland ; for the name is much ancienter than the introduc- 
tion of that office into the borders.
The learned Junius quotes Hefychius as 
explaining the word Mufe to fignify domefiicum atrium, the curtilage about the 
houfe : And in that fenle, it is eafy to conceive the office of Mufegrave.
The panfh of Mufgrave is bounded by the parifhes of Rumaldkirk and 
Brough on the Eaft ; by the parifhes of Kirkby Stephen and Crofby Garret 
on the Somh ; by the parifh of Warcop on the Weft; and by the fame pa- 
rifh of Warcop en the North : And contains in the whole about 38 families ; 
all of the church of England.
The church is dedicated to St. Theobald.
So in a deed of lands, in the 
20 Hen. 7.
Edward Crakenthorp is ftyled re&or of the church of St. Theobald 
in Parva Mufgrave, which was a miftake of the writer fcr Great Mufgrave ; 
for there never was a church at Little Mufgrave, which is a fmall manor in 
the parifh of Crofby Garret.
The faid church was appropriated to the abbey of St. Mary's York ; but 
the parifh, and confequently the revenues, being fmall, the abbot and con-

The clear yearly value, as certified to the governors of queen 
Anne's bounty, 48/.
The late rector Mr. Pindar gave 200/, to which the 
faid governors added other 200/, wherewith an eftate was purchaied at Orton 
in this county.
In the year 1248, the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York granted to 
Silvefter bifhop of Carlifle and his fucceffors, the patronage of the church 
of Mufgrave j faving to themfelves the ancient and accuftomed penfion out 
of the fame.
And about 40 years after, there was a difpute between the abbey and bi- 
fhop Halton about the patronage of this church, together with the tithes of 
Kirkby Stephen and other matters ; which ended in an arbitration and com- 
promise :' by which, the faid bifhop and his fucceffors fhould have the pa- 
tronage and advowfon of this church of Mufgrave.
In the quire of the church is a monument, with the figure of a fhaven monk 
graved in brafs, in his robes, holding up his hands in a praying pofture, and 
this infcription over hisbreaft, Repofita /pes infinu meo.
And in four roundells, 
one at every corner, an angel with this label, Mercy Jefu.
And under his feet,

feems to have been earlier than any account of the rectors of Mufgrave in the 
bifhop's regifters â€¢, for Ouds is a name that hath not elfewhere occurred to us.
In 1298, William de Burton^ rector of Mufgrave, had licence from the bi- 
fhop to go abroad and fludy in foreign univerfities for fix years.
He was af- 
terwards promoted to the vicarage of St. Nicolas in Newcaftle upon Tyne.
In the year 1303, bifhop Halton collated to this rectory Robert de Halouton^ 
probably his kinfman \ for fo the name was varioufly written.
In 1313, John de Bur don was collated by the fame bifhop â€¢, faving to the 
abbot and convent of St, Mary's York their ancient yearly penfion of 5 s.
Four years after this, the faid bifhop collated Thomas de Gculdington, with 
the fame provifion.
In 1330, Robert de Denham was collated by bifhop Roffe, on an exchange 
with the faid Thomas de Gouldington for the prebend of Hotherden in the- 
king's free chapel of Wolverhampton.
In 1337, Sir Adam de Levirton was collated by bifhop Kirkby.
In the next year, we find one John de Brydkirk rector of Mufgrave, who 
had a difpenfation of abfence by the faid bifhop Kirkby for three years.
In 1342, Jo' n de Stoketon, rector of Mufgrave, was confirmed (by patent) 
official of Carlifle, having formerly been invefted with that jurifdicfion by de- 
livery of the feal of the faid officialty.
After the death of John de Stoketon, one Sir William de Sanford was collated 
by bifhop Kirkby, but in what year doth not appear.
Next after him, was William de Ellerton; but on whofe collation or present- 
ation appeareth not.

taining a provifionary penfion affigned out of the faid rectory by the pope to 
Robert Kerret.
In the year 1359, one 'John de Soulby brought a prefentation from the king T 
who claimed by reafon of the bifhoprick being lately vacant and in the king's 
hands.
At the fame time, three writs of ' fcire facias were ferved on the bifhop, 
notifying that judgment had been given in the king's court at Weftminfter for 
his majelty both againft the bifhop himfelf, and alfo againft Robert Kerret and 
William de Ellerton clerks.
Hereupon a commiffion of inquiry de jure patro- 
natus was iffued ; and the king's claim proving good, the faid John de Scully 
was inftituted and inducted.
And foon after, he had letters dimiffory to all 
orders ; as well the inferior, to which he had not yet attained, as the facred 
orders.
By his will he bequeathed his body to be buried in the churchyard of 
St. Andrew's Holborn.
In 13 6 1, on the death of the faid John de Soulby, Sir Peter de Morland was 
collated by bifhop Welton.
In 1375, one Sir Richard de Upton was rector of Mufgrave-, who received 
abfolution by the archdeacon of Carlifle, from a fentence of fufpenfion incurred 
by his contumacy.
Jn 149c, in a rental of the revenues of the priory of Wederall, Sir Edward 
Crakenthorpe, rector of the church of Mufgrave, is charged with a penfion of 
Â§s a year to the faid abbey.
In i 556, Thomas Anggrome was prefented to this rectory by king Philip and 
queen Mary, during the vacancy of the bifhoprick.
In 1577, on the death of John Birkbeck, rector of Mufgrave, Jeojfrey Birk- 
beck was prefented by William Birkbeck of Gray's Inn gentleman, adminiftra- 
tor of the goods and chattels of Henry Birkbeck late of Eamont bridge, af-

The church, as the parifh, is but fmall.
On the fouth fide thereof, is a fair 
ile, having an arched door into it, and another arch by which it communicates 
with the church.
Perhaps it belonged anciently to the family of Mufgrave, 
but is now ufed by the parifhioners in common.
The parfonage houfe (lands about 50 yards wtft from the church.
It is a 
good ftrong building, erected by Mr. Pindar â€¢, beautifully fituated on the north 
bank of the river Eden.
But both houfe and church are fubject to inundation 
by an high flood.
The outhoufes were rebuilt by the late incumbent Mr.
Knowfley.
The manor of Mufgrave is flill in the family which gave name to the place.
It is called Great Mufgrave (as there is nothing great or little but by compa- 
rifon) to diftinguifh it from a lefs, which is parted from it by the river Eden, 
called Little Mufgrave, which belongs alio to the Mufgraves, and lies (as was 
obferved before) in the parifh of Crofby Garret.
They feem anciently to have 
been one intire manor, and apportioned into different parifhes by reafon of the 
inconvenience of the river running between.
The faid family at this place hath been very ancient and very numerous ; by 
reafon of which, it is difficult, if not impoffible, to inveftigate or diftinguifh 
the regular direct line.
Befides that there were, in this as in all other places, 
perfons furnamed from the place, who were no way related to the principal fa- 
mily there.
I. The firftof the name that we have met with, was Peter Musegrave, 
who lived about the time of king Stephen : for in the next king's reign, viz.
in the reign of king Hen. 2.
we find a difpute between Robert fon of Peter 
Mufegrave and the monks of Byland, concerning the boundaries of the refpec- 
tive manors of Mufgrave and Blaterne ; which diipute was compromifed and 
fettled in the county court at Appleby, William Fitz-Hugh being then 
fheriff*.

Robert Musegrave, fon of Peter-, with whom the difpute was about 
the boundary of the faid manor of Mufgrave as aforefaid.
Note, The manor adjoining to that of Blaterne is the manor of Little Muf- 
grave, which being defcribed by the general name of the manor of Mufo-rave, 
feems to confirm the conjecture aforefaid that the two Mufgraves were hereto- 
fore one intire manor.
III.
The next that hath occurred to us, was Adam de Musegrave, in the 
reign of king John-, who (amongft other perfons of principal note) was wit- 
nefs to a grant of wood and turbary at Sandford, by William de Sandford to 
the firft Robert de Veteripont.

In the next king's reign was Thomas de Musegrave.
For in the

to a grant of the laft Robert de Veteripont of lands to Richard 
Clerke of Appleby, one of the witnefTes was Thomas de Mufegrave then fherifF 
of Weftmorland, that is, under-lheriff to the faid Robert.
And this Sir Tho- 
mas (as he was afterwards called) was one of the executors of the laft will 
and teftament of the faid Robert.
In the 6 Ed. 1.
Thomas de Mufgrave and Ranulph de Dacre obtained a 
charter for a market at their manor of Orton.
V. The next that occurs was Richard de Musgrave.
In the 14 Ed. 1; 
in the partition of the Veteripont inheritance between the two daughters and 
coheirs of the laft Robert de Veteripont, the homage and fervice of Richard 
de Mufgrave were afligned to Idonea the younger daughter.
VI.
Thomas de Musgrave was the next in fucceflion.
In the 3 Ed. 2.
on an inquifition of tenants in Weftmorland who held by cornage, it was found 
that Thomas de Mufgrave, who was then under age, and in wardship, held Great 
Mufgrave, Moreton, Souleby, half of Rookby, and part of Sandford.
And 
at the fame time Richard de Muj grave held Little Mufgrave and Crofby Gerard.
This Richard feems to have been of a collateral branch of the family ; who 
had a brother Robert that conveyed lands to him in Soulby.

Sir Philip Musgrave baronet was of the age of feven years at the death 
of his father Sir Richard.
He married Julian, youngeft daughter of Sir Ri- 
chard Huttonof Gouldfborough in Yorkshire, one of thejullices of the court 
of common pleas: Which Julian died in the year 1659, and was buried at 
Edenhall.
He was returned one of the knights of the fhire for Weftmorland, in the 
parliament which met Apr. 3, 1640, and again in the November following.
In 1644, he was made commander in chief for Cumberland and Weftmoiland 
by a commiflion from the marquis of Newcaftle, and was alfo made governor of 
Carlifle.
At the reftoration of king Charles the fecond, he was chofen to re- 
prefent the county of Weftmorland in parliament.
He was much confidered 
by that king on account of his fervices and fufferings *, and by him was again 
made governor of Carlifle, which place he held during his life.
He had a war- 
rant for creating him baron Mufgrave of Harcla caftle, but declined taking out 
the patent.
He had a grant of the tolls of the city of Carlifle, which conti- 
nued in his family till the union.
He died in 1677, and was buried at Eden- 
hall, where is the following monumental infcription :

I. PARISH OF WARCOP.
'"p H E cups in the arms of Warcop feem to have been afiumed from a mifap- 
â– *â–  prehenfion of the name of the place â€¢, for it was never anciently written 
Warcup, but Warthecoppe, and fometimes Wardecop.
Coppe fignifies the top 
of an hill.
Which hill, no doubt, is the place where the tower or manor houfe 
flood, upon a rifing ground afcending from the river Eden.
Whether the 
former part of the word might be from zwath or ford over the river there be- 
fore the bridge was ere&ed, or rather from wardbeing kept there, cannot now 
with any precifion be determined.
The parifh of Warcop is bounded on the Eaft by the parifh of Mufgrave j 
on the South, by the parifhes of Crofby Garret and Kirkby Stephen ; on the 
Weft, by the parifhes of Afby, Ormefhead, and St. Michael's Appleby -, and 
on the North, by the parifh of Romaldkirk in the county of York: And 
contains about 117 families-, all of the church of England, except one or 
two.
The church is dedicated to St. Columbe \ by contraction, St. Combe.
Thus 
in the year 1380, Thomas de Sandford bequeathed, according to the cuftom 
of thofe times, to the vicar of Warcop 20J (which kind of legacy afterwards 
obtained the name of mortuary) for his forgotten tithes, and his body to be 
buried in the churchyard of St. Columbe.
And in 1526, Edward Hilton rector 
of Blechingdon by his laft will and teftament (hereafter mentioned) bequeathed 
a legacy for an obit to be performed in St. John's ile or porch in the parifh 
church of St. Combe of W 7 arcop.
â€” This faint is not in the Kalendar of faints 
in the Romim church, having never been canonized at Rome.
He was the 
apoftle of the Picls, and fettled in one of the Hebrides iflands, in the fixth 
century.
It is a vicarage, in the patronage of the lord of the manor; valued in the 
king's books at 9/ $s 3^; and returned to the governors of queen Anne's 
bounty at the clear yearly value of 45/.
This church was appropriated to the abbey of Shap, by Robert de Clifford, 
in the reign of king Edward the firft.
Which appropriation bilhop Halton

Martinmafs.
The laft rector, before the appropriation, was one Robert de Mufgrave ; unto 
whom we find a writ directed in the year 1310, concerning a difpute about a 
farm in Great Ormefheved.
On his death, the firft vicar, prefented by the abbot and convent, in the 
year 13 11, was William de Warthecoppe their late abbot.
In the year 1320, Hugh de Hoveden, prieft, and canon of Heppe, was pre- 
fented by the faid abbot and convent.
In 1359, one frier Nicholas de Prejion was vicar; who was excommunicated 
for negledt of paying his yearly penfion to the bifhop and to the abbey, and 
on his difcharging the fame was abfolved.
In 1574, Edward Knype was vicar of Warcop and rector of Clybburn ; who 
by his will bequeathed a fum of money for the purchafe of 20 nobles yearly 
of quit rent for ever, to be diftributed amongft his poor relations and the poor 
parifhioners of Warcop and Clybburn for ever by equal portions.
On the death of the faid Edward Knype in the year following, Sir David 
Jack clerk was inftituted, on the prefentation of Edward Warcopp of Warcopp 
efquire.
So that now the advowfon was come into the hands of the lord of the 
manor, by purchafe probably from the grantee of the crown, after the diiTo- 
lution of the abbey.
In 1585, on the refignation of David Jack, Sir Nicholas Deane was inftituted, 
on the prefentation of Jofeph Warcop gentleman.
On the ceflion of Nicholas Deane to Bromfield in the year 1589, Sir Robert 
Robfon clerk was inftituted on the prefentation of John Warcop of Warcop 
gentleman.
In 1597, on the death of Robert Robfon, Sir Anthony Jaques clerk was in- 
ftituted, on the prefentation of Thomas Brathwaite of Warcop efquire.
In 1625, on the death of Anthony Jaques, George Martin, B.

MANOR OF WARCOP.
So early as the reign of king John, we find William de Warthcop witnefs 
to a grant by the firft Robert de Veteripont to Robert fon of William de 
Sandford.
And to a grant of lands at.
M'orland to the priory erf* Wetheral, one of the 
witnefies w,as William de Wardecop.
In the time of John de Veteripont fon of the aforefaid Robert, there is a 
grant to the lord of the manor of Warcop (without naming him), and to the 
lords of Sandford, Burton,, and Helton, by the faid John de Veteripont, of 
** freedom from pulture of the forefters, and from all things thai he, his 
** ancestors, or heirs, or his forefters might or could take or demand at any 
<c time by occafion of the faid pulture, by the teftimony of his verderers or 
" other officers of the foreft : But if any forfeiture mould incur by reafon 
" of any trefpafs committed in the foreft, or of vert or venifon, the forefters 
" mould apply to the lords of the faid towns, and demand of them wytnefman,.
'* and the laid lords fhall find to the forefters wytnefman." 
After the death of the faid John de Veteripont, who died in the 26 Hen.
3. his fon Robert, then a minor, was committed to the cuftody of the 
prior of Carlifle, who fuffered great wafte to be done in his lands in 
Weftmorland-, and one of the jurors to inquire of the faid wafte was William 
de Warthecopp.
After the death of the faid Robert de Veteripont fon of John, who died m 
the 49 Hen. 3.
one of the commiJTioners appointed for making partition of his 
lands between his two daughters was Richard de Warthecop.
In the 20 Ed. 1.
Richard de Warthe.cop was- a juror in a caufe at Appleby,, 
between the king and the abbot and convent of St. Mary's York.
To a grant of lands at Ormefhead about this time, by Robert fon of 
Robert fon of Gamel de Sandford, two of the witnefTes were Richard de 
Warthecopp and Henry his fon.
In the 8 Ed. 2.
after the death of Robert de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that Henry de Warthecop held of the faid Roberr, on the day on which he died, 
the manor of Warthecop and half of Wateby ; the wardfhip whereof was 
worth 30/, the cornage i-js $d.
And: 
PARISH AND MANOR OF WARCOP.
6oj 
And in the fame year, as alfo in the 10 Ed. 2.
he was knight of the fhire 
for Westmorland.
The next was Thomas de Warthecop, who in the 3d and again in the 4 Ed. 3.
reprefented the faid county of Weftmorland in parliament.
In the 5 Ed. 3.
To a deed of lands at Breeks from Hugh de Ormefheved 
to Adam de Appelby, one of the witnefies is Thomas de Warthecopp then fheriff 
of Weftmorland.
â€” And there feerns to have been a fucceflion of feveral of the 
name of Thomas.
In the 50 Ed. 3.
Thomas de Warthecopp was knight of the fhire for the faid 
county.
So in the 4 Ric. 2.
and in the 8 Hen. 4.
the 9 Hen. 4.
the 2 Hen. 5.
and 8 Hen. 5.
Thomas Warthecopp was chofen reprefentative of the faid 
county.
And about this time the family was become much diffufed and multiplied.
For there was then a branch of this family fettled at Smardale, by marriage 
of the heirefs there.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, 
in taking the inquifition, Robert de Warcop was efcheator for the king ; and 
Thomas Warcop of Lambertfeat, and Thomas Warcop of Colby (who married 
the heirefs there), were two of the jurors.
There was then alfo one Thomas 
War cop of Warcop, who held divers lands there, but he was not lord of the 
manor ; for the inquifition finds, that Ralph earl of Weftmorland then held 
the manor.
There was alio one Thomas de Warcop about that time who mar- 
ried a coheir of Sandford.
After this, we find nothing particular concerning the Warcops of Warcop 
for feveral generations.
Probably they had been great fufferers, as moft of 
the northern gentry were, in the civil wars between the houfes of York and 
Lancafter.
And the manor feems to have been forfeited, and granted to the 
Nevils.
By an inquifition of knights fees in the 31 Hen. 6.
it appears, that 
George Nevil knight, lord of Latymere, held Warcop.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
Richard Nevil lord of Latymere held the fame.
And in the 24 Hen. 8.
John Nevil lord of Latymere, fon and heir of the faid Richard, held the faid 
manor.
And in the 1 and 2 Ph. and M.
George Nevil held the fame.
â€” After 
this, we find the manor come back into the name of Warcop.
And in the 
1 7 Eliz.
Edward Warcop of Warcop efquire prefented David Jack as aforefaid 
to the vicarage.
In the 28 Eliz.
J cfeph Warcop gentleman prefented Nicholas Deane to the 
vicarage.
In the 32 Eliz.
John Warcop gentleman prefented to the vicarage Robert 
Robfon clerk.
And this is the laft of the Warcops who was lord of the manor 
there.
The name and family was not then extinct, nor perhaps is yet, for 
there are feveral of the name in divers parts of the county.
But there are 
none of any confiderable note ; nor can they perhaps derive their pedigree 
from any of the aforefaid branches of this ancient family.
â€” Here therefore 
we leave the name Warcop of Warcop.
Their arms were j Sable, three cups with covers Argent.

The laft men-

the barony of Kendale.
His father Robert Brathwaite efquire of Amblefide 
(fon of Richard) purchafed the manor of Burnefhead ; which, being the larger 
eftate, he gave to this his eldeft fon Thomas, who afterwards purchafed War- 
cop : And with him therefore we begin our pedigree of the Brathwaites of 
Warcop.

the premiffes came to coheirs lifters of his father John Stephenfon gentleman; 
and upon a partition thereof, the manor of Warcop acceded to Elizabeth wife 
of William Prefton clerk, rector of Brougham ; whofe fon and heir William- 
Prefton, M.

Warcop-hall is an handfome commodious building, elegantly fituate on a 
rifing ground.
It was greatly improved, and much of it rebuilr, by the faid 
George Stephenfon.
But this was not the ancient manor houfe ; for that was at the place which 
is now called "Warcop tower : which was heretofore a large building, though: 
there is now nothing thereof remaining but a fmall farm houfe and out- 
houfes.

About 100 yards fouth-eaft from the village of Warcop, was a caftk, which 
appears to have been a large building, and to have taken up more than one 
acre of ground.
Mr. Machel fays, that he had feen fome part of the walls 
dug up, which were 15 foot thick, and of fair hewn ftone, well cemented 
with lime and fand.
And there was a tradition, he fays, that the ftones of 
the fteeple of the church at Kirkby Stephen (which was built about the year 
1606) were fetched from thence.
The place where the caftle flood {till goes 
by the name of Cajile-hill.
At about 200 yards diftance fouth-eaflward from the caftle, is a place in 
the common field called Kirkfteeds, where have been found wrought free 
itones â€¢, from which, and from the name thereof, it is fuppofed, that in this 
place heretofore there hath been a chapel.
Near the old Roman way, upon a place called Brough-hill, where the 
annual fair is holden, in cafting up the new turnpike road, were found in a 
direct line at equal diftances three Roman fecuris's or hatchets, not made of 
:ron and fteel, but of a much heavier metal like bell-metal.
III.
MANOR OF SANDFORD.
Weft from Warcop, lies the manor of Sandford, on the north fide of the 
river Eden ; which probably had its name from fome ford over that river, the 
foil being remarkably fandy all thereabouts.
In the reign of king John, there is a grant by William fon of Robert de 
Sandford, to Robert de Veteripont, of his wood of Sandford and all the tur- 
bary of the faid town, in coniideration of his being dilcharged from homage 
â€¢ and fervice, and of the fum of ten marks in filver and one palfrey ; defcribino- 
the boundaries as follows : " Beginning from Crefkeld-beck where it falls 
** into Coupmanebeck, and fo going up through the middle of Erthufeaill 
" to a place where Rouche-beck falls into the faid Crefkeld-beck, and lb

After the death of John de Veteripont fon of the faid Robert, it was 
found by inquifition, that the prior of CarliQe, guardian of the heir during 
his minority, had fuffered great deftru&ion to be made in the underwoods of 
Sandford.
In the 14 Ed. 1.
in the partition of the inheritance between the two daugh- 
ters of the laft Robert de Veteripont, Idonea the younger daughter had allot- 
ted to her the homage and fervice of Richard de Sandford.
In the 18 Ed. 1.

In the 43 Ed. 3.
by an inquifition of knights fees, it is found, that Thomas 
de Sandford then held Sandford of Roger de Clifford, by homage and fealty, 
and is \d cornage.
â€” Which Roger de Clifford granted and confirmed to this 
Thomas and Ifabel his wife common of turbary in Sandford ; fo as they and 
their tenants pay their accuftomed yearly rent of one halfpeny for every cart 
load in Sandford myre.
Jn the 12 Ric.2.
Robert de Sandford was knight of the mire.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
by the inquifition poft mortem of Roger de Clifford, it is 
found, that Robert de Sandford then held the manor of Sandford.
In the 4 Hen. 4.
after the death of Maud de Clifford, the inquifition 
finds, that Robert de Sandford held the fame of her as part of her dower and 
jointure.
In the 1 Hen. 5.
Robert de Sandford ferved in parliament as burgefs for 
Appleby.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the jurors find, 
that Chriftopher Berdefey and Margaret his wife, and Thomas de Warthecopp and 
Katherine his wife, held the manor of Sandford, as of the right of the faid 
Margaret and Katherine.â€” -From whence it is clear, that this eldeft branch of 
the family of Sandford (in like manner as almoft all the other great families) 
ended in daughters.
By an inquifition of knights fees in the 3 1 Hen. 6.
it appears, that Thomas 
Warcop vicar of Kirkby Stephen as of the right of Katherine his late wife, and 
Chriftopher Berdefey as of the right of Margaret his wife, daughters and coheirs 
of Robert Sandford efquire, held the fame.
â€” And afterwards, in the fame year, 
Thomas Warcopp of Colby fon of Thomas JVarcopp late vicar of Kirkby Stephen 
as of the right of Katherine wife of the faid vicar, and Chriftopher Berdefey and 
Margaret his wife as of the right of the faid Margaret, held the fame, by 
homage and fealty, and 3^4^ cornage.
In the 18 Hen. 8.
Thomas Warcop of Colby, fon and heir of Edward War- 
cop, held Sandford of Henry earl of Cumberland.
In the 1 and 2 Ph. and Mary, Barnaby Warcop held the fame.
In the next generation, the fame went off again with daughters coheirs.
For in the 34 Eliz.

Talbot Bowes of Eglefton Abbey in the county of York efquire and Agnes his 
wife, daughters and coheirs of Thomas Warcop of Smardale efquire deceafed,

And the faid Andrew Wharton fold the demefne and rents to the feveral in-

We have not found to whom the rectorial tithes of Sandford were imme- 
diately granted after the diffolution of the monafteries.
In the year 1678, 
they were in the poffeffion of Thomas Gabetys efquire of Crofby Ravenfworth, 
who fold the fame to William Crook of Coppal in the county of Lancafter 
gentleman; and in 1700, Samuel Crook of the fame place gentleman, and 
Mary Crook widow his mother, fold the fame to feveral of the inhabitants;, 
who afterwards fold out to the reft.
The hall or manor houfe was fold by the faid Andrew Wharton to Richard 
Fawcet â€¢, in which houfe there was anciently a chapel, as appears by the afore- 
faid licence of abfence to Henry de Sandford.
There was a tenement and cottage at Sandford which**belonged to Shap 
abbey ; which, at the time of the diffolution of the ab^g, was in the poffef- 
fion of one Robert Bolland.
W 
Nigh to Sandford field corner, on the right hand of the^road leading from 
Warcop towards Appleby, not far from the Roman way, are three or four 
Tumuli.
The largeft of which is 91 paces in circumference, the next 86, 
the next about 40, the other a fmall one almoft defaced.
And near the fame 
was a circle of ftones, almoft at equal diftances, in diameter about 50 paces j 
which are now removed, being made ufe of in building.
The largeft of thefe tumult was opened in the year 1766, at the defire of 
Dr. Charles Lyttelton bifhop of Carlifle and prefident of the Antiquarian 
fociety, by the reverend William Prefton of Warcop hall aforefaid ; who gave 
to his lordfhip the following account : " Agreeable to your lordmip's direc- 
** tions, I yefterday finifhed cutting through the largeft of the barrows or 
*' tumuli upon Sandford moor.
Though I employed 6 or 8 men, it took us 
" up three whole days.
We drove a level, and for fome time found nothing 
Â«' worth taking nocice of.
At laft a workman going to the very top of the 
" barrow, and beginning to dig there, about half a yard below the furface 
" threw out a fmall piece of a veffel, upon which we examined every thing 
" with great care, and immediately found a fmall urn or veffel, let in a 
" large one.
It contained fomething white like afhes, as much as might be 
" laid upon a fixpence, which the wind foon difperfed.
On one fide of the 
*Â« urn, but a little deeper, lay a two-edged fword, with a curious carved hilt, but 
" almoft deftroyed with ruft.
Its breadth is nearly two inches and a half; 
" its length, fomewhat more than two feet.
On the other fide lay the head, 
" as it feemeth, of an halbert or fome fuch inftrument, together with fome 
*' other things which I cannot explain.
Underneath thefe, about a yard 
" deeper, we came to what at firft appearance refembled a vault, but on a 
" nearer examination proved to be nothing but a vaft .heap of ftones of 
*' various kinds, fuch.
as are not to be found on that moor or near it.
In 
*' clearing the place of thefe, we found nothing* till at the very bottom, 
'Â« and as near as we could guefs exactly under the urn, we came to a fquare 
Â«' place about 4 feet in length and 2 in breadth.
In this was laid fome 
Vol. I.
4 I " rich 
6,0 PARISH OF WARCOP.
(Sandford.) 
'* rich black mould, about 3 inches deep, and amongft this were many 
'* human bones, which evidently appeared to have been burned.
Under 
" this was nothing but folid gravel.
The flones had been pikd up in form 
tc of a pyramid, and the diameter of the ground they covered was about 
Â»* 6 or 7 yards, and the depth we funk, elpecially in the center, fomewhat 
<â€¢' more than fix." 
Near to thefe Tumuli is a fmall camp, with a fingle trench â€¢, and at a 
fmall diftance upon another hill is another camp of about the fame di- 
menfions.
On the right hand of the road, going towards Appleby, near Coupland 
beck bridge (as it is commonly called, but the name of it in the ancient evi- 
dences is Coupmanbeck) hath been a round fortification or caftle, the diameter 
whereof within the walls was 40 paces, and the thicknefs of the walls (includ- 
ing the rubbi(h) about ten yards.
The (tones of a red colour, and ftrongty 
cementfd with lime and fand.
Over againit the faid fortification, but nearer to the bridge, is a fquare, 
which feems to have been the place where an hoipital formerly flood.
That 
fuch hoipital there was, appears from the partition made of the inheritance of 
the lait Robert de Veteripont between his two daughters ; for in the {hare 
of Ifabella was, the advowfon of the hofpital of Coupmanbeck.
And in a deed 
without date of a moiety of the manor of Helton from Thomas to Andrew 
de Hellerton, one of the bounder marks is, from fuch a place down to the 
hofpital of Coupmanbeck.
IV.
MANOR OF BURTON.
North from Coupland beck bridge, at the fkirt of Roman fell, (as it is now 
called, not for any particular reafon deducible from the time of the old 
Romans, for the ancient name of it was Rutmanfell) lies the hamlet of Burton.
This, like many of the reft, wis heretofore in the hands of a family deno- 
minated from the place.
We find feveral of the name de Burton in the reign 
of king Henry the third.
But foon after, it came into the name of Helton, probably by marriage 
of the heirefs of Burton ; whofe arms were, Argent, a bend wavy Sable.
In the 20 Ed. j.
by a deed dated at Burton, William de Helton granted cer- 
tain lands at Ormefhead to Thomas de Helton : Witneifes whereof were, Henry 
de Threlkeld fheriff of Weftmorland, Henry de Warthecopp, Thomas de 
Warthecopp, Richard de Blenkinfop, Hugh de Ormeiheved, and others.
In the 8 Fd. 2.
by the inquifition poft mortem of Robert de Clifford, it is 
found, that William de Helton held of the faid Robert on the day on which 
he died, the manor of Burton; the wardfhip whereof, when it mould happen, 
was worth 10/ yearly, and the cornage 13 s ^.d.
In the 43 Ed. 3.
William de Helton held the manor of Burton.

PARISH OF WARCOP.

In the 50 Ed. 3.
William de Helton ferved in parliament as burgefs for 
Appleby.
In the 2 Rio 2.
John fon of John de Hilton, by a deed dated at Burton, 
made a fettlement of certain lands and tenements, rents and fervices, in the 
vills of Sandford and Hilton Bacon, upon Agnes de Hilton (his daughter, as it 
feemeth) and the heirs of her body, remainder to Thomas ion of John de Hilton 
and the heirs of his body, with remainders over.
In the 15 Ric. 2.
after the death of Roger de Clifford, the inquifition finds, 
that William de Hilton and Agnes his wife held the manor of Burton, as of the 
right of the laid Agnes.
â€” So that here it had gone off with the faid Agnes, 
married probably to one of the fame family.
In the 12 Hen. 4.
John de Helton represented the borough, of Appleby in 
parliament.
In the 10 Hen. 5.
after the death of John de Clifford, the inquifition finds 
that William de Helton held the manor of Burton, by homage and fealty, and 
13^4^ cornage.
In rhe 15 Hen. 6.
Robert Helton, fon and heir of William Helton, fon and heir 
of William Helton, fon and heir of Thomas Helton, brother am!
heir of William 
Helton, made a fettlement of certain lands at Ormefhead and Great Afby.
In the 31 Hen. 6.
William de Helton held the manor of Burton of Thomas 
de Clifford, by the like fervices as before..
Next we come to a pedigree certified at Dugdale's vifitation in 1664.
"Which pedgree neverthelefs, although it confiiled only of 6 generations, 
feems (as molt of the other Heraldic pedigrees, when compared with the 
inquifitions poft mortem and other authentic documents) to be very imperfect.
However, the pedigree (fuch as it is) runs thus : 
1. Ckriftopher Helton vÂ£ Burton efquire, in the reign of Fd. 4.
married 
Marguet daughter of Thomas Mat-mail of Kirk Ofwald : And had iffue, 
2. Richard Helton of Burton efquire; who married ifabel daughter of John 
Barton of Ormefhead efquire : And had iffue, 
3. Andrew Helton of Burton efquire ; who married Alice daughter of John 
Aglionby of Carlifle ; and by her had iffue (i) John.
(2) Winifred, married 
to Leonard Mufgrave of Johnby in Cumberland.
(3) Julian, married to an 
Irifh lord, and afterwards to a fea captain.
4. John Hilton of Burton efquire, fon and heir of Andrew, married Mary 
daughter and coheir of Saxton of Byham hall in EiTex ; and died about the 
year 1630.
He had iffue, (1) Cyprian, (2) George, who married Jane 
daughter of Fletcher of Dovenby in Cumberland.
(3) Johan, who died un- 
married.
5. Cyprian Hilton of Burton efquire, fon and heir of John, married Frances 
daughter and fole heir-f of Sir Chriftopher Pickering of Ormefhead, and 
â€¢}â–  So fays the pedigree ; but flie was baftard daughter of Sir Chriilopher Pickering, who having 
ro other child, and nevtr having been married, gave to his faid daughter the manor of Otme/head.
Her mother's name was Todhunier, Sir Chiiitopher's milkmaid at Threlkeld.
The faid Frances 
was firft married to John Dudley a lawyer, to whom (he had no iflue.

with her had the manor of Ormefhead.
He died in 1649-, and had iiTue, (1)

(2) John Hilton of Stanemore, who married Ifabel daughter of 
John Farer of Warcop Tower.
(3) Andrew, who died without iiTue.
(4)

6. Chrijlopher Hilton of Ormefhead eiqu re, ion and heir of Cyprian, 
married Barbara daughter of Thomas Brathwaite of Warcop efquirej and 
was of the age of 36 at the aforetaid vifuation.- â€” So far the pedigree.
But, intermediately, in the 18 Hen. 8.
by an inquifition of knights fees 
holden of Henry earl of Cumberland, it appears, that Robert Hylton then 
held the manor of Burton.
And in the fame year, by the will of Edward 
Hilton clerk, whereby he deviled a cottage at Helton Bacon to charitable 
ufes, Robert Hilton of Burton and his heirs are made truftees of that 
charity Â£.

In the 1 and 2 Ph. and M.
upon an inquifition of knights fees in Weft-

V. MANOR OF BLEATARN.
South from Warcop, on the oppofite fide of the river Eden, is the 
village of Bleatarn ; fo denominated from the tarn and marlhy ground 
thereabouts.
This manor was granted to the abbot and convent of Byland in Yorkfhire 
of the Ciilertian order, in the reign of king Henry the fecond.
And there 
are divers charters yet extant, granted in the fame king's reign (as appears 
from the names of feveral of the witneffes) with the feals very compleat and 
perfecl, now in the poffeffion of Mr. James Richardfon of Birks within the 
laid manor, whereby divers lands at Warcop and Bleatarn are granted and 
confirmed to the faid abbey.
The firft is by John Taillebois, of all his lands which Robert fon of Torphin 
had oiven to him and his heirs, on the weft fide of the river Eden.
Wit- 
neffes whereof are, Robert archdeacon of Carlijle, Murdach dean (rural, of Weft- 
morland), Henry chaplain of the archdeacon, Robert chaplain of Appleby, Umfrey 
Mahii-catulus, Michael de Hardcle, and others.
The fecond is by Torphin fon of Robert, of a moiety of the lands at War- 
cop on the weft fide of the river Eden, comprehended within the boundaries 
therein particularly fpecified f.

The third is, by Walkve de Bereford, of the fourth part of the other moiety* 
defcribing the very fame boundaries.
The fourth is, by Thorphin ion of Robert, and Robert his brother â€¢, being 
a confirmation of grants made to the faid abbey by Walleve de Bereford, 
Robert fon of Thorphin, John Tailebois, and Richard fon of Ketel.
Witnefies 
whereof were, IVilliam lbn of William, Thomas de Hellebeck, Robert, fon of 
Peter, Conan de Afc, William fon of Robert de Afcabi, Gilbert and Adam his 
brothers, Richard Englifo, William his fon, Robert de Helton, Richard fon of 
Maud, Gilbert his fon, Robert fon of Copfy, and John his brother.
About which time we meet with the record abovementioned, of a caufe 
depending in the county court at Appleby, between the aforefaid Thorphin 
fon of Robert and the monks of Byland of the one part, and Robert fon of 
Peter Mulegrave and his tenants of the other part, concerning common of 
pafture between Blatarne and Mufgrave.
And the fame was compromifed in 
the court there, and it was fettled, that there (hall remain to Robert fon of 
Peter 82 acres, viz.
from the thorn, upon Hoberghe, acrofs the fike under 
Maureberghe, to the way towards Mulegrave-, and from the faid thorn the 
whole fhali remain to the monks towards the Grange, and to the way nigh the 
chapel, and the cattle of Robert fhall never enter within thefe boundaries, nor 
the cattle of the monks wichin the property of Robert.
Alfo Robert fhall 
have one outgate for the cattle of Mulegrave upon Maureberghe, between 
the culture of the monks and the vale under Hoberghe, and from thence to 
the Tarn, and from thence to the way upon CreiTekcld which goes towards 
Appleby, and to the place where four ways meet, and from thence to the head of 
the Tarn.
All this mail be in common pafture for the cattle of Mufegrave and 
the cattle of the monks.
But the monks mall plow the culture nigh the mill 
dam unto the Tarn, and fhall have their culture upon Mureberghe, and the 
meadow in property, as they had before this compofition, and fhall plow 
nothing more there ; and the cattle of Mufegrave therein fhali never enter.

There is alio another charter, which from the names of the witneffes appears 
to have been in the reign of Hen. 3.
whereby Thomas de Fenton, fon and heir 
of Richard de Fenton, confirms to the faid abbey one carucate of land in 
Warcop called Plowlande, which Richard fon of Ketel gave to the faid abbey : 
"WitnelTes whereof were, Ralph de Daker, Thomas de Mufegrave, Richard de

Afoeby, knights ; William de Wardcop, Geoffrey de Melkinihorp, John de Horme- 
Jheved, Robert de Flormefheved, and John de Helton.
And there is an inclofure at Plowlands which ft ill bears the name of 
Chapel mire.
The abbey of Byland was furrendered to the crown in the 30 Hen. 8.
by 
John Leedys, alias John Allenbrig ; and in the 38 Hen. 8.
Nov. 4, the king 
for the consideration of 2100/ us od granted to Margaret Symfon widow, 
Anthony Bella/is clerk, and William Bella/is efquire (amongft other particulars) 
the demefne and manor of Blaterne, and all the lands there called Hornegill 
garthes, formerly in the tenure of Henry earl of Cumberland, and late in the 
tenure of Richard Bella/is deceafcd, former hufbandof the faid Margaret and father 
. of the faid WiUiam, and then in the tenure of the faid Margaret as executrix 
in truft for the faid William her fon.
This Richard was fteward of the faid 
manor to the faid abbot and convent, and before the furrender obtained a 
grant of the fame for 61 years.
On Margaret's death, it furvived to Anthony 
and William ; and on Anthony's death witnout iffue, the whole came to the 
faid William, who was fucceeded by his fon ShWilliam Bella/is knight, father 
of Brian Bella/is efquire, father of Sir William Bella/is knight, father of Richard 
Bella/is efquire, who had a fon William Bella/is efquire, who in the 22 Cha. 2.

Tarnhoufe in Ravenflondale gentleman; which George Fothergill (old the fame 
to Sir Chrijlopher Mufgrave of Hartley cattle baronet, anceflor of the prefent 
owner Sir Philip Mufgrave baronet.
In the 44 Eliz.
there was a fuit in the court of York for the Northern 
parts, between John Pulleine of Scotton in the county of York plaintiff, and 
the tenants of Blaterne defendants; of the record of which caufe the aforefaid 
Mr. James Richardfon hath an exemplified copy: By which it appears, that in 
civil caufes that court did not much differ in the form and manner of proceed-

ing from the high court of chancery.
The addrefs is, tc To the Queen's 
*' mod excellent majeftv, and her honourable counfel eftablifhed in the north 
" parts." The plaintiff in his bill fets forth, that Richard Bcllaffes of Mor- 
ton in the county of Durham efquire, then lately deceafed, had granted to 
him the plaintiff a leafe of a moiety of the manor of Blaterne, for the term 
of 40 years, if he the plaintiff fhould fo long live : That the tenants hold 
their tenements to them and their heirs, according to the cuftom of tenant- 
right ufed and allowed within the faid manor, by paying to the lord thereof 
certain yearly rents ; and by doing her majefly's fervice upon the borders of 
England anenft Scotland, when and as often as they mail be thereunto re- 
quired by the lord warden of the weft marches : And that every tenant, by 
cuftom of the faid manor, ought to pay a reafonable fine and greffom, on 
the change or alteration of lord or tenant : That the plaintiff had demanded 
a reafonable fine arbitrable according to the moiety of their feveral rents, after 
the rate of 7 years fine according to the quantity of their rents; and that 
the defendants had refufed to pay the fame.
The tenants anfwer, as to the 
fines, that they had no fuch cuftom ; but that on the death of the lord or 
tenant, they were to pay a god's-penny only, and nothing on change of lord 
by alienation or leafe.
Unto which there is a replication, and rejoinder, and 
an examination of witneffes upon interrogatories.
And finally, upon exami- 
nation and deliberate hearing of the caufe, in the prefence of learned counfel 
on both fides, it is ordered by the court (in refpeel: that the witneffes were fo 
contrary and repugnant one to another, that the court could not conveniently 
determine concerning the cuftom), that the caufe be referred to be tried by 
the due courfe of the common law, and not to be returned hither and heard 
in this court hereafter in equity, becaufe the tenants refufe to abide the 
arbitrary -f- order of this court, or of any other indifferent commiffioners 
to whom the court would have referred it, but the defendants obftinately 
and wilfully affirmed in open court, that they would be ordered no otherwife 
than by her majefty's laws.
And the court order the manner in which the 
caufe fhall be brought to iffue at the common law.
Neverthelefs, the right 
honourable Philip lord Wharton is required by this honourable court, to call 
the plaintiff and defendants before his lordfhip, and to end the matter arbi- 
trarily betwixt them if he can; and if his lordfhip cannot conveniently fo do, 
then the parties may proceed at the common law as aforefaid.
But Mr.
Pullein dropt the fuit, and nothing farther was done.
But in the 18 Cha. 2.
there was a fuit at law between the laft William 
Bella/is aforefaid and the tenants, concerning the fines ; which by the recom- 
mendation of Sir Chnftopher Turner judge of affize was referred to the 
arbitration of Sir John Lowther ; who awarded, that they fhould pay a {even- 
penny fine, on change of lord by death, and on change of tenant by death or 
alienation : That in cafe of a widow, the finefor that part which (he holds (viz.

And by 
confent the fame was decreed in the court of chancery accordingly.
The faid abbey had a cell of monks here at Bleatarn.
Their buildings 
appear to have covered a pretty large parcel of ground.
About 30 years ago, in digging amongft the rubbifh, was found an arched 
vault, fuppofed by the workmen to have been an oven, out of which they 
took more than 40 cart loads of (tones.
About 2 years ago, in a fmall brook, which hath waflied or run near to 
the walls of the abbey, were found the fide pofts and part of a fluke or lock, 
which feems to have been placed there for laying under water four or five 
acres of ground above the fame ; which parcel of ground yet goes by the 
name of the Tarn, and a large field thereto adjoining is called Tarn Moor.
At a fmall diftance eaft from the abbey, are the veftiges of two large fifh 
ponds ; near to which, about 60 years ago, were dug up feveral pieces of 
leaden pipes, fuppofed to have been for conveying water to the faid fifh- 
ponds.
A little fouth-eaftward from the faid ponds, is a large parcel of ground, 
now common, which appears to have been inclofed with an high earthen 
fence and a ditch on each fide, part of which fence yet remains j and the 
fame goes by the name of the Abbey park.

After the death of the reverend William Smith curate of Burnefhead in

The tenants of fuch of 
the faid mefluages, lands, and tenements as were let to farm, claimed a

Barton to be by the faid vicar nominated to the bifhop in order to obtain his 
lordfhip's licence, who did thereupon nominate him accordingly.
The tenants 
prefented to the bifhop their candidate the reverend John Jackfon, fetting 
forth their claim, and praying him to be admitted.
Four caveats were 
entred at Chefter ; and the parties (according to cuftom in like cafes) became 
violent and exafperated.
The bifhop, in order to get rid of the caveats with 
as little trouble to himfelf as might be, and to fave charges to the parties, 
intimated, that if no fuit mould be commenced within the fix months, fo as 
that the curacy fhculd fall in lapfe, he would licenfe the faid Mr. Barton.
Upon this the land owners acquiefced.
And upon the lapfe, Mr. Barton was 
licenfed accordingly.
â€” Upon the merits, it doth not feem that there could 
have been any doubt as to the legality.
For whatever right of election the 
land owners may claim by cuftom againft the vicar, there is no fuch cuftom 
for the tenants or farmers againft their landlords.
By the improvement of the rents of lands, it is faid that this curacy is now 
worth 70/ a year.

Windermere water.
This lake, with regard to the fifheries, is at prefent divided into three 
cubbies (as the people call them, which in Mr. Machel's time were called 
cables; but from what foundation either of the words is derived we have not 
found).
The firft cubble or divifion, being the high end of the lake, con- 
tains one fifhing.
The fecond cubble or divifion, being the middle part of 
the lake, contains five fifhings.
The third cubble or divifion, being the low 
end of the lake, contains fix fifliings.
In the year 1774, the houfe called Holme-houfe in the middle of the 
great ifland in this lake was demolifhed, in order to be rebuilt and enlarged ; 
in the place whereof, a very curious edifice hath been erected by Mr. Englifh 
the prefent owner : which having attracted the attention of travellers and 
other vifitants of the lake, it is thought proper here to give fome account 
thereof.
â€” The building is a perfect circle fifty-four feet in diameter.
The 
roof thereof is a dome, dated with fine blue flate got in the neighbourhood.
The walls of this building are built of a blue flint (tone, which came from a 
place called Hacklerigg, the property of Dr. Atkinfon.
The ftones which 
are raifed from the quarry are very large.
There are feveral ftones in the 
â€¢building which are twenty-two feet in length, and a great number fifteen 
feet.
The building is four ftories high, exclufive of the garrets, which are in 
the roof, which is fomewhat remarkable it being a dome : the laid garrets 
are lighted from the roof, but it doth not in the leaft affect the outline of 
the building.
The principal rooms are lighted by Venetian windows, and 
are

are fo placed as to have a view on each end of the lake.
The principal 
entrance is under a portico fupporred by fix columns and two pilaRers fix 
foot in height exclufive of the bafe and capital.
The columns ftand on 
pedeftals fix foot in height, and continue all round the building â€¢, which form 
the area for the lower part of the building, which is nine foot below the fur- 
face of the ground, and contains the kitchens, brewhoufe, fervants hall, 
cellars, and other offices.
The afcent into the above-mentioned entrance is 
by two flights of circular fteps as high as the pedeftai, where there is a large 
landing before the hall door.
The whole building is intended to be very 
elegantly finifhed, with mahogany doors, window-frames and every other 
article fuitable thereto.
The pedeftal part ftands upon a fquare plan, and 
the proprietor propofes planting different kinds of trees in clumps, at a cer- 
tain diftance from-each angle, which will form four villas from the building.
The height from the ground floor to the cieling is fixteen feet.
From the 
fecond floor to the cieling, fourteen feet and fix inches in height.
From the 
third floor to the cieling, ten feet in height.
From the fourth floor to the 
cieling, eight feet and fix inches in height.
The principal rooms are feven- 
teen feet fix by twenty-two feet, and continue the fame from the ground 
floor to the top of the building.
â€” In cutting a large drain on the weft part 
of the building, which is to take away the wafh from different parts the 
building to the lake, were found feveral pieces of lead and old iron, and a 
great number of old bricks.
About fix feet deep in the earth, they dug 
through feveral old drains.
And a chimney was found in its perfect ftate.
They found at the fame time feveral pieces of old armour.
In levelling the 
ground on the north part of the building, they dug through a beautiful 
pavement, curioufly paved with pebbles of a fmall kind, They alfo dug 
through feveral curious gravel walks.

Redmans of Over Lewins.
Of this family, moft probably was Richard Redman, D.
D. perhaps a 
younger brother of Matthew Redman (fon of Richard) who was knight of the 
fhire in the 20th Hen. 6.
This Dr. Redman was zealous in the intereft of the 
houfe of York, whereupon he was promoted by king Edward the fourth to 
the fee of St. Afaph in the year 1468.
In 1471, he was made abbot of 
Shap.
In the reign of king Henry the feventh, he became intangled in the 
affair of Lambert Symnel, and on that account incurred the king's difpleafure, 
and by him was complained of to the pope; who by a bull, dated Jan. 9,1487, 
commiflioned the archbifhop, with the bifhops of Winchefter, Ely, and 
Exeter, to inquire into that matter, and to tranimit the refult of it to Rome.
It is fuppofed that he acquitted himfelf to the king's fatisfaclion, as he was 
in 1492 appointed by him one of the commiffioners to treat of peace with 
the Scots, and in the year after was made one of his privy council.
In 1495, 
he was promoted to the fee of Exeter; and in 1501, was tranflated to Ely; 
which promotion having enjoyed not full four years, he died Aug. 4, 1505, at

Betham.
It hath appeared, that our conjecture was right, concerning the manor of' 
Betham not having been forfeited by Sir Thomas Betham in confequence of 
the battle of Bofworth field.
For it continued in the family by a female heir 
a long time after that, and did not come into the Derby family until the reign 
of king Charles the fecond.
And the fucceflion of that ancient family of 
Betham, which we often find mentioned in the occurrences of thofe times, fo 
far as we have been able to recover the fame, hath been as follows : 
I. The firfl: that we meet with was Ralph de Betham, who was witnefs 
to the foundation charter of Cockerfand abbey.
This Ralph, for the health 
of his foul, and the foul of his wife Ingaretha, gave a fait work, with two 
patellae, in Betham, to the abbey of Furnefs, in the reign of king Hen. 2.
II.
Thomas de Betham, fon and heir of Ralph, married Amuria, one of 
the four daughters and coheirs of Richard Fitz Roger lord of Wood Plump - 
ton in Lancafhire, by his wife Margaret daughter and heir of Dunftan Banifter; 
by whom he had two fons, Ralph and Roger.
Ralph the elder, in the 17th 
year of king John, (amongft other fons or daughters and heirs of divers mefne 
lords holding under the barons of Kendal) was delivered as an hoflage to the 
faid king, for the future fidelity of Gilbert fon of Roger Fitz-Reinfred and of 
William his fon, who had joined with the rebellious barons.
The faid 
Thomas appears to have been living in the 26 Hen. 3.
being in that year a

crmet.

in the 30 Ed. 1.
and again in the 2, 4th, and 5th of Ed. 2.
In the fourth, 
year of the fame king Ed. 2.
he obtained a charter for a market and fair in 
Betham.
His wife's name was Emma, who furvived him ; for in the 7 Ed. 3.
Joan wife of John le Tours lord of Lowick, and daughter of Sir John Ie 
Fleming, had fettled on her the reverfion of what Emma de Betham then 
held in dower.
By his faid wife Emma, he had iflue a fon Robert, and two

Sir George Middleton of Leighton, baronet; which dignity he

He was a great fufferer 
in the royal caufe, having been fubjected to fequeftrations and fevere compo- 
fitions.
He married Frances daughter and heir of Richard Rigg of Litde 
Strickland efquire, and by her had iffue Mary and Katharine.
And thefe 
two caufcs feem to have effected the difmembring of the eftate, namely, the 
impoverifhment of the family by fequeftrations, and the fucceffion of co- 
heireffes.
And about this time the manor of Betham came into the Derby 
family.
Mary, the elder daughter of Sir George Middleton, was married to Som- 
erford Oldfield efquire of the county of Chefler, who had iffue George 
Middleton Oldfield efquire, who came to live at Leighton, and left two 
daughters coheirs; the elder was married to Albert Hodgson efquire, and 
the younger to one of the Fletchers of Hut ton hall in Cumberland, and 
died without iffue.
The laid Albert Hodgfon engaged in the rebellion in 1715, 
and his eftate was conhi'cated.
â€” What became of Katharine, the other 
daughter of Sir George Middleton we have not found.
* 
What were the arms of Betham is not certainly agreed.
Mr. Weft 
(whofe knowledge in matters of that kind is unqueftionable), in his Antiqui- 
ties of Furnefs abbey, fays, that the arms of Betham were ; Argent, a chief 
dancette Sable.
In the heralds office, the arms of Betham are -, Or, three 
Quwer de lys Argent : And thefe latter were depicted in a window of the 
gallery

gallery of the old Hall at Leighron, exprefsly by the name of Betham f.
And yet on the monument in Betham church, whereon are the effigies of a 
man and woman cut in flone, which undoubtedly hath been erected in me- 
mory of fome of the Betham family, amongft the feveral efcutcheons found 
there, the flower de lys do not appear.
Our account of this monument, 
which we gave in the body of the work, was copied from Mr. Machel's 
manufcript, who though he perfonally vifited the feveral places, yet here he 
had not the opportunity of a thorough examination,* For by the floor of 
the chancel having been raifed about a foot and an half above the level of the 
body of the church, the monument was half buried.
The prefent worthy 
'vicar hath had the curiofity to examine it to the bottom, and the arms 
thereon appear as follows (beginning at the head of the man on the fouth fide, 
and fo going eaftward).
i. A raguled crofs.
2. Six annulets, three, two, 
and one.
3. Efcalops, two and one.
4. A faltier ingrailed.
5. On the 
north fide, at the foot of the woman â€¢, A chief indented, or otherwife a chief 
dancette, but it doth not evidently appear which of the two.
6. A lion's 
head guardant.
7. A crofs lozengeed.
Under the head of the lady, there 
is a vacancy large enough for another coat, but there is none, nor doth ic ap- 
pear that any hath been defaced.
Now here are neither the flower de lys, nor 
the chief dancette (unlefs the coat at No. 5 be fo ; which is at leaft doubtful).
Nor have we found to whom the firft coat, under the head of the man, did 
belong.
The fecond is Mufgrave.
The third, Strickland.
The fourth, Mid- 
dleton.
The fifth, moft probably Burton, whofe coat was a chief indented.
The fixth, Fitz-Roger.
And the feventh, Croft.
If we could fuppofe that 
the vacancy beneath the head of the lady was left for the flower de lys or 
other arms of Betham to be engraved afterwards, and that the bearing at 
No. 1 was affumed by the Middletons of Leighton to diftinguifh them from 
the other branch of the family at Middleton hall (a thing not without ex- 
ample), all the reft might- eafily be accounted for.
It is clearly not the 
monument of the laft Sir Thomas Betham and his lady (as is commonly 
fuppofed), but is more modern, and feems to have been put up by Thomas 
Middleton of Leighton efquire, in memory of his father Sir Robert Mid- 
dleton, and his mother Anne heirefs of the family of Betham.
â€” They were 
connected with the Mufgraves, by a daughter of Sir Thomas Betham.
â€” This 
Thomas Middleton's wife was a daughter of Strickland.
