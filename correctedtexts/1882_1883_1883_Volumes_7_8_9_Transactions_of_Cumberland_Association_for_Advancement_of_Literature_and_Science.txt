iprombmgs at i^t Annual gt^^ting at Carlisle, i88: 
(Tahenfrom the Carlisle Journal and the Patriot.) 
The Annual Meeting of the Cumberland Association was held this 
year at Carlisle, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 30th and the 31st of May.
The proceedings were opened at One p.m. in the Fisher Street Hall, by 
an Address from the President of the Association, Mr. Egbert Ferguson, 
M.P. The Hall was well filled with representatives of each of the local 
Societies.
Business of a formal nature connected with the Association was 
next taken, and then the members proceeded to inspect the Gas Works 
under the giiidance of Mr. Hepworth, the manager.
The various 
objects of interest were successively pointed out, and the stages of manu- 
facture of the gas were described, from the charging of the retorts, to the 
purifying process, and the final storage in the great meter, which is capable 
of passing 60,000 cubic feet of gas per hour.
The place where the gas is 
tested was also visited.
Leaving the Gas Works, the party divided, one section visiting the works 
of Messrs.
Hudson Scott and Sons, where Mr. Scott and Mr. B.
Scott con- 
ducted the visitors, first to the letterpress and block-printing department, 
where about thirty machines were producing a variety of colour work ; then 
to the designing room ; then to the transferring department, the stereoty^Ding 
department, the colour-grinding and ink-making rooms, the composing room, 
the enamelling and paper-surfacing room, on to the making-up department, 
where between thirty and forty young women were busily employed.
The other section visited the hat manufactory of Messrs.
Carrick & Sons, 
and inspected the interesting processes employed in the manufacture of felt 
hats.
Votes of thanks were passed to Mr. Hepworth, the Messrs.
Scott, and 
the Messrs.
Carrick.
In the Evening a goodly number again assembled in the Fisher Street 
Hall, to hear a lecture by Prof.
Williamson, F.R.S., on "Pre-Historic 
Arctic Vegetation." 
On Wednesday Morning, business was resumed at the same Hall, and 
papers by various contributors were read, aud discussed : most of these will 
be found printed in the present volume of the Transactions.
In the Afternoon a large party proceeded by train to Wetheral, en route 
for Corby Walks.
Here the Secretary read some "Geological Notes on 
Corby Walks," by Mr. Goodchild, who was detained in London on official 
business.
After the party had examined the beautiful scenery of the 
neighbourhood, the Mayor of Carlisle (R.
S. Ferguson, Esq.
) gave a short 
history of Corby and the Howards, and the party then dispersed.
Through- 
out the gatherings the weather was all that could be desired, and the 
Annual Meeting proved one of the best that had been held for some time 
past.

The Committee, in presenting the fifteenth Annual Report, have 
much pleasure in announcing the past Session has been one of the 
most successful of the Association.
The number of Members has increased from 280 to 336 — 87 of 
whom are Associates.
The financial position of the Association is satisfactory, as the 
balance of ;^3i odd due to the Treasurer has been reduced to 
;!^i9 odd, and the Subscriptions have been reduced to within 
about ;^i5.
The Session was commenced with a Conversazione, which was 
as popular as those of past years.
v 
Ten ordinary lectures have been given, and one special one by 
Professor Seeley, F.R.S., F.G.S., &c., on "Crocodiles, their Pro- 
genitors and Allies." The whole of the lectures have been well 
attended.
The Library now numbers 266 volumes, exclusive of Patent 
Specifications, Magazines, and Periodicals.
The Science Classes are again conducted by Mr. Freeman and 
his staff, but the number of students have not been so large as last 
Session.
Several additions have been made to the Museum, and 
the Committee would be glad to receive further gifts from the 
Members and their friends.
Zoological Classes have been held, but they were poorly 
attended.

There were two Field Days or Excursions last summer.
The 
first to Honister Slate Quarries and Butterraere, on the 22 nd June, 
at which thirty-six members and friends were present.
A short 
paper was read by the Secretary, on the "Geological Features and 
History of the Honister Slate Quarries, together with some account 
of the quarrymen, their work, and the dangers to which they are 
exposed." The second was to Greystoke Castle and Park, in 
company with the Carlisle and Penrith Societies, on the 3rd August, 
when thirty-three members and friends were present.
On this 
occasion a very excellent paper was read by J.
G. Goodchild, Esq., 
on "The Physical History of the Scenery of the Neighbourhood." 
The attendance at the Public Lectures and Ordinary Meetings 
was better than in some of the preceding Sessions.
The number of members on the books at the commencement of 
the Session was 154; of these thirteen failed to make good their 
membership, while ten new members were elected, making a total 
at the end of the Session of 151, being three less than the number 
reported last year.
The total income of the Society, including the balance from last 
year, amounted to ;^So los.
id., and the expenditure — including 
;^io presented to the Keswick Library — amounted to ^39 5s.
sd., 
leaving a balance on hand of ;^ 1 1 4s.
8d.
The accounts connected 
with the Museum of Local Natural History also show a credit 
balance of ^64 iis.
iid., after defrapng all expenses up to the 
end of the Session.
The Hon. Curators of the Museum report that considerable 
progress has been made in extending the collection.
In this they 
have been aided by the contributions of several friends, some of 
whom have on previous occasions made donations to the Museum.
A few articles have been sent in on loan, and one or two specimens 
have been purchased.
The Collection, -.vhich consists of about 2,500 specimens, is 
entirely confined to articles illustrative of the Natural History and 
Antiquities of the District.
During the past winter the Museum has been open to the public 
free of charge, on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.
The 
number of visitors has been only small, but on the latter day the 
opportunity has been taken advantage of to an extent, that at least 
justifies the experiment.
During the summer months the Museum 
was exhibited as heretofore by the Messrs.
Mayson, but at all times 
the members of the Society and their friends have free admission 
to the Hall.
On the visit of the Geologists' Association to Keswick in August, 
the members were invited to the Museum, and several of them 
bore cordial testimony to the excellence of the collection of rock 
specimens, minerals, and the other valuable illustrations of the 
geology and physical features of the district, which are the monu- 
ment of the devoted labours ot the late Mr. J.
Clifton Ward.
His 
work in founding and so richly furnishing the Museum, ought to 
stimulate the people of Keswick to do all in their power to complete 
it in a worthy and satisfactory manner.
The following are the Officers and Committee for next Session : — 
President, Rev. T.
K. Richmond; Vice-President, Rev. A.

The Committee in presenting this its Sixth Annual Report, has 
the pleasing duty to again chronicle an increase in the number of 
members, viz.
136 this year — of whom 35 are ladies — against 131 
last year, 3 1 of whom were ladies.
The attendance at the Lectures has not been quite so good as 
during the Session of 1880-81; still, it has been far from 
discouraging.
Severalchanges have been made in the Rules this Session, and 
with the best results.
The Subscription previously was 5s.
to both 
ladies and gentlemen, young men under twenty-one being admitted 
for 2s.6d.; but this was altered, so as to make the Subscription for 
ladies 2s.
6d.
also.
Besides, Non-Members were admitted free to 
all Public Lectures, but sixpence each is now charged for their 
admission to all Lectures, both public and ordinary.
Next Session, 
family tickets are to be issued, the price of the same being los.
each.
The best thanks of the Society are due and tendered to those 
gentlemen who so kindly volunteered their services during the past 
Session.
The following new Honorary Members have been added to the 
list, viz :— Professor Seeley, F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.; W.
I'Anson, 
Esq., M.B.; W.
H. Kitchin, Esq.; J.
G. Goodchild, Esq., F.G.S.; 
Rev. J.
W. Todd, D.D.; Rev. C.
H. Gem ; J.
Nixon, Esq., B.A.
Financially, the Society is in a flourishing condition.
The 
balance is not so large as last year ; but this is to be accounted for 
by the reduction in the Subscription of the Lady members.

The number of members on the roll now amounts to sixty-six, 
being an increase of ten over last year.
The Programme of Meetings published at the beginning of the 
Session was fully carried out, with the exception of a Paper by the 
Rev. T.
H. Irving, and a Lecture by J.
D. Kendall, Esq., both of 
these gentlemen having been prevented by unavoidable causes 
from fulfilling their appointments this Session.
It is a matter of regret that few beyond the members of the 
Society attend the Public Lectures.
Considering the great merit 
of the Lectures, and the kindness of the Lecturers who give their 
services so readily, it is much to be desired that larger audiences 
could be brought together to profit by them.
The Ordinary 
Meetings of the Society were well attended, and the several Papers 
and Discussions created very much interest.
During the summer Excursions were made to Langholm, Corby 
Castle, Kirkandrews-upon-Esk, and Kingfield.
At these Meetings 
Papers were read by members on subjects of local interest; and 
especial mention must be made of the kindness of the Rev. F.
Taylor, rector of Kirkandrews-upon-Esk, and Mrs. Taylor, who 
explained to the party the method of working his extensive apiary, 
and exhibited several most interesting experiments with his bees.
Before leaving the rectory, the party was entertained to a most 
excellent tea.
Mr. White likewise deserves the thanks of the Society 
for his kindness in conducting the members through the grounds 
and gardens of Kingfield House.
At the Annual Business Meeting it was resolved that all gentle- 
men who give two Public Lectures to the Society, should thereby 
become Honorary Members, and entitled to all the privileges of 
the Society.
In accordance with this resolution, the following 
gentlemen were enrolled: — R.
A. Allison, Esq., Scaleby Hall; 
W. Easton Robertson, Esq., Marsh House, Canobie; and R.
J. 
Baillie, Esq., Grosvenor College, Carlisle.
The Income of the Session from all sources amounted to 
^9 4S.
8d.; Expenditure (including a deficit from last year of 
^2 5s.

to High Head Castle.
Owing to the heavy rain on Whit-Monday, 
the attendance of members was not large ; but the three last days 
were marked by a numerous attendance.
Some excellent papers 
were read.
Upwards of one hundred copies of the Transactions have been 
distributed among the members.

In presenting the Fifth Annual Report, the Committee have 
pleasure in being able to record a markedly revived interest in the 
Society, and to congratulate the members on the completion of a 
very generally successful Session.
On July 8th, a very interesting and pleasant Excursion was 
made to Barrow-in-Furness.
The Steel Works were visited, and 
the various processes in the manufacture of steel rails were very 
le 
ably and courteously explained by gentlemen connected with th 
works.
Afterwards the Jute Works were visited 
_ During the past Winter Session, nine public lectures have been 
lTT.t r ''f''''y^'''''^Ss held.
The increased attend- 
ance both of members and non-members, shews that they have 
been appreciated.
The thanks of the Society are especially due 
to the lecturers for their valuable services.
The Committee have again to regret a falling off in the number 
of ordinary meetings.
The debate opened by the Rev. E.

Reynolds was well attended, and the discussion very fairly main-

The Committee have again to report the close of a successful 
Session.
A charge of sixpence each has been made to non-members for 
admission to the Public Lectures; but the Ordinary Meetings 
have been made free to all — and to this fact, probably, may be 
attributed the uniformly good attendance throughout the Session.
Although the Subscription is so low (2S.6d.
for the Session), the 
Society was again able to place a small balance to the sum lying 
at their credit ; but this would not have been the case had not a 
handsome sum remained after paying the expenses of the Marine 
Excursion, which was so ably managed by Dr. Leitch.
This 
Excursion was the only one to which many of the members went ; 
the one arranged along with the Longtown Society partly failed 
through that Society being obliged to change the date at the last 
moment, owing to the floods in their neighbourhood.
The number of members is not equal to that of last Session, 
there being 90 now against 103 for last year.

Our Public Lectures and Ordinary Meetings have been well 
attended during this, our first Session ; and, as a Committee, we 
have reason to congratulate ourselves on the success that has 
attended the formation of our Society.
The number of members is now about 150.
On Easter Monday, 
April roth, 1882, the first Field Excursion was made.
The party 
met at Appleby Station, and started thence for Helton Beck and 
Keisley, under the guidance of Mr. Goodchild as Geologist, and 
Mr. Hodgson of Watermillock as Botanist.
We were also accom- 
panied by Mr. Marr, and for some time by Professor Hughes of 
Cambridge.
The best thanks of the Committee are due to Mr. T.
V. 
Holmes, F.G.S., for a valuable present of Books, forming as it 
does the nucleus of our proposed reference library.
§t\mi 0f §i^^0dati0n ^^cvctarj.
During the past year the number of members has been larger 
than in any previous year, being 1380, or 231 more than in 1880-81.
This is partly due to an increase in the membership of some of the 
older affiliated Societies, and partly to the accession of the Penrith 
Literary and Scientific Society, which joined the Association during 
the past winter.
The Cockermouth Society seems to be extinct.
The financial condition of the Association is satisfactory, but 
less so than it might have been if some of the affiliated Societies 
had taken more copies of the Transactions.
One Society has not 
taken any.
This is to be regretted, because it is undoubtedly the 
best volume the Association has yet produced, containing, as it 
does, almost nothing but original papers on local subjects.
The Grant to the Public Lecturer last year was ^^5 more than 
in former years.
The printing of the Transactions costs about one shilling per 
copy of 200 pp.; and as the volume is sold for one shilling, it is 
not possible to increase its size beyond 200 pp.
Last year, several 
very interesting papers had to be left out on this account.
It 
might be desirable to increase the price to one shilling and sixpence, 
and thereby allow the volume to be enlarged to about 300 pp.
It has been suggested that members of the Association should 
have the privilege of attending the Lectures and Meetings of any 
of the affiliated Societies.
If the suggestion be approved, it might 
be embodied in a new Rule.

CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF THE 
ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
By ROBERT FERGUSON, M.P.
(Presidential Address at the Carlisle Annual Meeting.) 
A CELEBRATED French writer, M.
de Gerville, has lately put 
forward a calculation that in a hundred years hence, the English 
speaking population of the world will number 140,000,000, as 
compared with 40,000,000 speaking French, and 50,000,000 
speaking German.
Without taking this particular estimate as 
anything more than an intelligent speculation, we cannot doubt the 
general fact that the English language is destined to a remarkable 
predominance over all the other languages of the world.
I do not 
propose here to go into the question how far this is due to the 
characteristics of the language itself, and how far to those of the 
race who speak it, and to the institutions, staunch and yet elastic, 
evolved from those characteristics, though both are no doubt very 
important factors in the case.
I propose rather to enter into a 
few considerations on the interesting question as to what is likely 
to be in the far-distant future the condition of that language.
Will 
it maintain its essential unity when a thousand years shall have 
passed away, when Australia shall contain a population to which 
that of the mother country can bear no comparison, and when 
America shall have filled up with teeming myriads all her vast 
continent, and still pressing on to the fulfilment of her destiny, 
shall have crowded out the weaker races and the less stable 
institutions of the Southern Hemisphere?
Or will it, as is the 
opinion of some writers on the subject, become ultimately divided 
1 
into say three great branches, the Britannic, the American, and the 
Australian, differing perhaps as do the Danish, the Swedish, and 
the Icelandic, the last named, like the Britannic, representing the 
parent speech.
Under the old conditions of the world, this 
separation would take place with even greater rapidity than was 
ever the case in former times, inasmuch as men are now projected 
to greater distances, and thrown into new and strange modes of 
life, which involve new trains of thought, and require new modes 
of expression.
But the restraining forces, namely, the ever- 
increasing personal inter-communication, the interchanges of the 
press, and — most effective agent of all — the possession of a 
common literature coming home to all, are so entirely new in the 
experience of the world, that the past affords no guide whatever 
for the future.
I am disposed, then, to come to the general conclusion, that 
unless circumstances should arise which it would be unreason- 
able to contemplate, it is impossible that the literary language 
should ever be other^vise than one and the same throughout the 
English-speaking domain.
And, if that view hold good, I take it 
to be equally impossible that the language should split up into 
three or into any number of branches.
At the same time, within the limits of a literary language 
essentially uniform, there is room for a very considerable diversity 
of spoken dialects, and this is, I think, the direction which the 
course of events will take.
I think it even possible that such 
diversities of dialect may, in the course of time, become so great 
as to amount to something like a diversity of language within the 
fold of the common language ; so that there would be two 
languages — the language of every day life, and that taught in the 
schools.
The speech of the miners of the Far West, for instance, 
as made familiar to us by the writings of Bret Harte and others, 
has even in this short time become something differing very 
considerably from standard English, and yet these men read and 
enjoy the works of the best English authors.
This is not a new 
thing to us even in Europe.
In Germany, for instance, there is, 
in addition to the High German which has become the standard 
language, a Low German spoken in the north, which any of you 
as a German scholar would not understand.
Now this is in itself 
quite as good language as the other ; but mainly by the accident 
of the Bible having been printed in it.
High German has become 
the standard language, and so Low Germans speak one language, 
and learn another in the schools.
The same thing obtains to 
some extent in England, and still more in Scotland ; and the 
reason why they speak such good English about Inverness is said 
to be, that it is so far different from the native speech, that it is, 
more than elsewhere book — that is to say, classical — English.
I think it then possible, that differences of dialect may arise, in 
the course of time, so considerable as to make one member of the 
English-speaking family unintelligible to another, and that then 
they will agree, by mutual consent, to fall back upon the standard 
English which both of them have learned at school.
I say that 
this may be so, and that it will be compatible with the existence 
of a uniform literary language.
I do not say that it will be so, for 
the restraining influences will be ever increasing with the advance 
of science ; and what the achievements of science will be in the 
ages that are to come, what man is there who will venture to 
foretell?
But I am inchned further to the opinion, from the current 
indications that come before us, that as regards what we may call 
the more civilised speech — that is, the language of the press and 
of the better educated — the changes which occur will take place 
to a great extent pari passu throughout the English-speaking 
range, and that these changes will come not from the mother 
country, but from outside, and mainly — for some time to come at 
least — from America.
Of this I shall bye and bye proceed to give 
the indications.
Now, the only English-speaking community 
outside our own which has lasted long enough to give us any data 
for comparison is of course American.
Let me observe in passing 
that English people are apt to look rather unfairly upon what are 
called Americanisms.
We take our own speech as the standard, 
and any colloquial variations from it we look upon as partaking of 
the nature of oddness, if not of vulgarity.
Now this I conceive to 
be altogether uncalled for.
During the period which has elapsed 
since the separation took place, various colloquial changes have 
taken place in both countries — the Americans are quite as much 
entitled to make them as we are ; and, indeed, certain of what we 
call Americanisms are simply words or phrases originally common 
to both, which have been retained by them, but which with us 
have died out.
On the other hand, the claim has been advanced 
by some of their writers on behalf of the Americans, that they 
speak better English all round than we do.
In a certain narrow 
sense this may be the case That is to say that we have a number 
of provincial dialects that do not exist with them, and which are 
more or less different from standard English.
But these are for ' 
the most part ancient forms of speech, in most cases equally 
correct with, and in certain cases more correct than the standard 
speech.
Let me give an illustration which may be interesting to 
Cumbrians.
Is there any single word which may be taken to be 
the shibboleth of the Northerner ?
That is to say, any expression 
by which a man educated so as not generally to be distinguished 
from another man, betrays his Northern origin ?
I have heard my 
late brother-in-law, Dr. Guest — than whom there is no higher 
authority on the subject — say that that shibboleth is the way in 
which he renders the past tense of the verb to beat.
The ordinary 
Englishman makes no difference between the present and the past ; 
the Northerner, as he says 7neet, met, says also beat, bet.
While then 
the ordinary Englishman would say, " He thought he could beat 
me, but I beat him," the Northerner would say, " He thought he 
could beat me, but I bet him." This is as old as (no doubt older 
than) the time of Chaucer, for Chaucer was, it is supposed, a 
Northern man : — 
"And still upon his breast he betj'^ 
I adduce this as a casual instance of a provincialism in reality 
more regularly formed than the equivalent word of standard 
English.
It is difficult for us to form a just comparison between English 
and American speech, for the error which is new to us, naturally 
strikes us more than that with which we have been all our lives 
familiar ; yet I am disposed to think that in America, the lower 
middle class, and to some extent the middle class, speak rather 
less correctly than they do in England, and I account for it by 
two different causes.
The first is the prevailing sentiment of 
equality, which gives a man the half-unconscious feeling that he 
has no right to speak better English than his neighbours.
This 
naturally does not apply so much to large places Avhere men can 
form themselves into sets, as to small places, where I have 
observed that the one or two persons of better education, clergy- 
men, for instance, who are probably graduates of a University, 
instead of striving to maintain a higher standard of language, 
succumb, in ordinary conversation, to the influence of that which 
they hear around them.
The second cause of the corruption of the language I take to 
be the peculiar circumstances of the local press in all the smaller 
places throughout the country.
The English country paper is a 
property which descends from father to son often for many 
generations, and he who is intended to succeed to it is educated 
more or less with reference to the post which he has to undertake.
His journal appears as a rule once, or at most twice a week, and 
he has ample time to prepare careful and well-considered summaries 
of the events of the week.
He is from his training qualified to 
write good English, so that throughout the district which his paper 
serves, to many of the people of which it is probably, the only 
literature they read, the standard of the language is not suffered to 
be degraded.
In America, where a town of four or five thousand 
people has a couple of daily papers, all this is entirely changed.
A man comes to a new place, and he says to himself—" What 
does this place want?" If he thinks it wants an eating-house, he 
will start an eating-house; if an hotel, he will start an hotel ; if he 
thinks there is room for a preacher, he will perhaps even start in 
that line.
There is— to the honour of the Americans— one thing 
he cannot do— he cannot start a school.
But it is as likely as not 
that he may elect to try a paper for a while, and, if that does not 
answer, try something else.
Thui" he comes to his task with no 
special qualification.
While the English country editor is as one 
6 
who from a more or less higher stand-point lays down the law to 
his fellows, the American editor is like a man standing chatting on 
equal terms with his neighbours.
As an illustration of the free- 
and-easy terms upon which they stand, I quote a Httle notice in 
which the editor of a Memphis paper announces the forthcoming 
marriage of one of his assistants.
The account is headed, " Our 
strong arm cleaned out by Cupid," and concludes with the hope 
that the lady will "curl his ambrosial locks for him." While, 
then, the extinction of a paper in England is an event always more 
or less worthy of notice, papers in America come and go without 
remark.
In the city of Sacramento, out of seventy-nine papers 
that had been started during the previous twenty-six years, there 
were at the time I was there only thirteen remaining, and now 
perhaps not so many.
Now, men of this sort, who have no special 
qualifications for the work themselves, and of course are not in a 
position to command it from others, are men who so far from 
assisting to keep up the standard of the language, tend rather to 
degrade it.
These are the men who have no scruple in coining 
any word that suits them.
"A store was burglarised^'' "a body 
was resurrected" "a man dilitated on his journey," &c.
This, 
however, is only a passing phase ; for as these towns rise in wealth 
and population, we may be sure that journalism of a higher class 
will not lag behind in the advance ; and meantime, from one point 
of view, it is an honourable characteristic of the Americans, that 
they will have a Press of some sort ; indifferent it may be, but still 
the best that they can get.
I have already made the remark that the changes which have 
taken place in the language of late, and, I may add, those which are 
foreshadowed in the future, come not from the mother country, 
but from America.
And on this point it is worthy of note that we 
do not seem to have adopted any of the older words formed in 
America, before the intercourse between the two countries became 
such as it is now.
But the new words which come to the front in 
America at the present, seem mostly to find their way into English 
speech.
One of the last words which we have adopted from them 
is collide^ which certainly avoids a periphrasis.
We now say, 
7 
"two trains collided^'' instead of, as formerly, "came into collision.'^ 
Another word which has lately come into general use is lengthy, in 
the place of long, applied more specially to a speech or article.
The word lengthy, as it used formerly to be used, always involved 
more or less of the sense of tediousness.
And if, ten years ago, 
any one had happened to make the remark (which I noted in a 
paper a day or two ago) "that Gladstone had made a lengthy 
speech," he might probably have met with the retort, " Not a bit 
too long ; '' whereas now the word is accepted as simply doing 
duty in place of long.
This substitution, then, I take to be by no 
means a gain to the language.
Instead of our word big, as applied 
to a man, woman, or child, the Americans have for some time 
used the word large, and I perceive that in this also we are now 
beginning to follow suit.
Looking at the origin and the etymo- 
logical connections of the respective words, I cannot think that 
this is a change for the better.
Then again, the word woman 
seems, at least in common speech, to be in a fair way of becoming 
extinct in America, where it is superseded by the word lady.
The 
same seems to be to a great extent the case in England ; and if 
you should happen to cast your eye over a list of public-houses to 
let in the columns of a newspaper, you will find in not a few cases, 
after a recapitulation of various attractions, such as "good drinking 
neighbourhood," &c., the concluding remark, "would suit a lady." 
But of all the words they have made us a present of, there is none 
to my mind more objectionable than the word mammoth, as 
applied to something very big.
In America everything on a great 
scale is a mainmoth thing, from the great cave of that name in 
Kentucky, to the last large grain elevator ; and the word, I am 
sorry to say, is becoming completely naturalised in England.
I go 
along the railway, and I see on the station walls an advertisement 
of a ' ' mavimoth turnip;" in one of the very first of provincial 
papers, I read of the " mammoth yacht built for the Emperor of 
Russia ; " and even as I am writing this I take up one of the 
London evening papers and am informed that Cook made a 
^^mafnmoth break" at billiards.
Fancy a word taken from a 
gigantic extinct animal applied to a turnip and to a break at 
billiards !
I now come to speak of the more general tendencies of the 
language in America, and following at some distance in England.
Now, there is in America a process going on the reverse of that which 
has taken place in the case of words derived by us from the Latin 
through the French.
In the rapid torrent of GaUic speech there 
are many words which have had as it were their edges smoothed 
away, like pebbles rounded in the torrent's bed.
Thus softened 
from the Latin probare we have prove, from rccuperare we have 
recover, from dilitare we have delay.
Now, the American is sparing 
of speech, and at the same time craving for energy of expression, 
and he likes to use words of which he can as it were get a good 
grip in his mouth.
Hence his tendency is to restore all those words 
thus softened to their original form.
Thus prove he makes back 
again into probate, approve jinto approbate, reprove into reprobate 
(we also have " reprobate," but in a sense rather different from 
reprove, reprobate expressing the passive sense of disapproval, 
and reprove the active).
Announce again he changes back into 
annunciate, recover into recuperate, and delay into dilitate.
Now, I 
do not mean to say that all those words are as yet established in 
American speech ; the only one that can be said to be regularly 
adopted is recuperate for recover, though probate for prove is also 
in certain cases, but all the others may be found in the speech 
and in the newspapers of the country.
And I have once or twice 
of late remarked the use of recuperate in this country.
To the same craving for energy of expression may be owing 
that redundancy of negatives which is such a distinctive feature of 
American speech.
When Mrs. Stowe made Topsy say, " Nobody 
didn't make me, I don't think," she only expresses what you may hear 
any day in America.
" This train don't stop at no more stations, 
I don't think," I remember a man saying to me on a railway as we 
were approaching our journey's end.
These are rather the grosser 
forms of the abuse ; but nine hundred and ninety-nine Americans 
out of a thousand whom you may meet, will say, " I couldn't get 
a basket nowhere," and "there is no more, I don't think," even 
if they avoid the more common — " there ain't no more, I don't 
think." And I am sorry to say that, though not in such an 
aggravated form, the same abuse is becoming so common in 
England, that you will seldom find one of the younger generation 
who would not make use of the phrase, "There is no more, I 
don't think." 
I have before made the remark, that while there is in this country 
a strong tendency to adopt the new words that may be coined in 
America, yet that we abstain from adopting the older words that 
were in use before the inter-communication became such as it is at 
present.
We have escaped, for instance, the word donate, which 
has almost entirely supplanted the word give in America.
To this 
word, severely as it has been condemned by English, and even more 
severely by American critics, there is not, in an etymological point 
of view, any objection; and it does in a few cases avoid the 
periphrasis of "give as a donation." Yet it is a pretentious and 
therefore objectionable word, which if it once got a footing in 
England, would very probably in common speech supersede, as it 
has done in America, the good old Saxon give.
Another vicious 
expression from which we have escaped is the use of as for that, 
as in " I think as I will go to Penrith to-morrow," a word which, 
though here a rank vulgarism, I have heard used in America by 
graduates of Harvard.
I notice also in America a habit of applying to inanimate things 
a phrase which is only apphcable to human beings.
Thus in the 
Scientific American (an admirably conducted periodical by the 
way, and one of which I desire to speak with all respect) that a 
tornado "demolished one story of a building, and demoralised 
another." Fancy speaking of the morals of a building !
Again, 
the expression high-toned is a favourite one in America, as applied 
to a man of high honour and character.
But now I observe that 
a tradesman in Washington advertises a stock of " high-toned " 
boots and shoes.
An American might, however, reply, and with 
justice, that this is not any more objectionable than our use of the 
word genteel, as similarly applied.
I have noticed in America the 
10 
rise of a curious phrase.
When a man retires from the army, he 
is said to be "mustered out of the service." This had its origin 
at the time of the close of the war, when a regiment was mustered 
in order that the men might be paid off before returning to civil 
life.
Thus the phrase became synonymous with leaving the army, 
so that I now read how General So-and-So was " mustered out of 
the service." However, the critic on the other side would, I 
doubt not, be able to bring forward a list of offending expressions 
in this country which do not strike us, because we are so familiar 
with them.
There is certainly one thing from which the Americans can 
claim an exemption, and that is the abuse of the letter H.
Now, 
this abuse the Americans, not recognising that it is the special 
attribute of the 'Arry of Punch, generally adduce as the shibboleth 
of Englishmen in general, and that without the slightest attempt at 
discrimination.
Thus an American comic paper makes Lord 
Dundreary (of all persons in the world) talk about "Hold 
Hengland." And happening to be in the States at the time of the 
visit of the Prince of Wales to India, I noticed in the Neiv York 
World a skit, not at all an ill-natured one, upon his proceedings in 
that country.
But in this article the suite of the Prince, repre- 
sented as composed of dukes, archbishops, &c., were invariably 
made to address him as, "Your Tghness." Dr. Russell, the 
literary associate of the expedition, was made to vaunt himself as 
having "the heye of an aak;" and even the Prince himself, apropos 
of shooting a tiger, was made to give utterance to the magnanimous 
observation, " Hengland hexpects hevery man to do 'is duty." 
Now the World is one of the four principal journals of New York, 
and we can hardly suppose it possible that any of its contributors 
really believe that the language of the British court is such as 
above quoted ; this is rather an example of what is too common 
in America — writing down to the prejudices of the people.
Now, in conclusion, to summarise the ideas which I have 
ventured to put upon paper.
I cannot conceive, in the first place, 
that the literary language of the English-speaking race will ever be 
otherwise than one and the same.
How grand will be the position, 
11 
how vast the responsibility of the great author of the future, who will 
have for an audience possibly half the world !
I think also that 
within the range of this common language, there may be room for 
a great diversity of spoken dialects, all leading up by graduated 
lines to the one common centre.
Whenever that far distant time 
shall come of which I have ventured to speak, it may find the old 
country far surpassed in population, in wealth, and in material 
resources, by the younger and more unfettered races to whom she 
has given birth.
But it will find her, let us venture to beUeve, 
still the great centre of civilising influences, still the honoured 
mother of mighty nations, and the parent of great and free 
institutions.

LOCAL ENTOMOLOGY,

Geometr.«.
By GEORGE DAWSON.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
On looking over the lists of Geometers collected by other entom- 
ologists, I find that a greater number occur here than in any other 
locality, and that our list includes several species that have hitherto 
been regarded as peculiar to the New Forest, or to other parts of 
the South of England.
These will be noticed in the order 
observed in Newman's British Moths.
Fam. I.
— UROPTERYDiE.
Swallow-tailed Moth ( Vropteryx sambucata).
This large insect 
is of common occurrence here, especially in the evening and the 
early morning, from July to the end of August.
They are to be 
found at Rickerby, Morton, and Kingmoor ; and I have seen them 
also at Langholm, across the Border.
Fam. IL— ENNOMiDiE.
The Dark-bordered Beauty (Epionevespertaria); The Bordered 
Beauty {Epione apiciaria), are both common at the localities just 
given, as are also.
The Brimstone Moth (Rutnia cratagata) and 
The Light Emerald ( Metrocampa tnargaritaria).
42 
The Barred Red (Ellopiafasciaria), occurs in the fir plantations 
at Warwick, Newby Cross, and Orton.
The pupae of this northern 
moth often occur along with the pup^e of the Bordered White, 
and they may be recognised by their larger size, and the pale yellow 
colour of the wing cases.
The Scorched Wing (Eurymene dolabraria) is rare here.
I have 
taken only five, and these occurred in a wood near to Dalston 
Low Mill, but on the opposite side of the river.
The first one I 
took many years ago, while beating some hazels ; and for the last 
two seasons I have not seen any, nor have I been able to find the 
insect in any of our local collections.
The Thorn Moths {Selenia, Odontoptera, Sic.,) may be easily 
obtained by searching the gas lamps at night or early in the morning, 
especially about Stanwix and in the Warwick Road.
They may be 
obtained by beating the trees, as they make no attempt to fly after 
coming to the ground, and are easily taken with the hands.
I have 
taken them on the wing in Newbiggin Woods and in the woods 
about the Gelt.
They are often found sitting on the Honeysuckle, 
and are easily capture*, as they are very weak fliers, and they often 
fall at once to the ground when a tree is beaten, and can then be 
easily taken with the hands.
The species of this genus I have 
found here are the Lilac Beauty (S.
or PericalUa syringaria) ; The 
Early Thorn (S.
illunarid) ; The Lunar Thorn {S.
lunarid) ; and 
The Purple Thorn {S.
illustraria).
This last is double brooded 
the first brood appearing in May and the second in August.
The 
May brood is so much larger and brighter coloured than the 
second as to look like a different species.
I have reared insects 
from eggs laid in May which developed into moths quite unlike 
the products of the August batch.
The Thorn Moths can be easily distinguished from the other 
genera by their scalloped wings and feathered antennae.
Of the remaining genera.
The Scalloped Hazel {Odontoptera 
bidentatd) ; The Canary Shouldered Thorn {Ennomos tiliarid) ; 
The Feathered Thorn (Himera pennaria), are the species I have 
met with here.
43 
Fam. III.
— Amphydasyd^e.
The Pale Brindled Beauty {Phigalia pilosaria).
This, one of 
our earliest moths, may be commonly found in February and 
March sitting on the trunks of trees in the neighbourhood of 
Carlisle.
The female is wingless, and looks more like a beetle 
than a moth.
The pupse are about three quarters of an inch in 
length, and may be found by digging at the roots of the Oak and 
the Beech.
The Oak Beauty {Amphydasis prodromarid).
This is another 
very early species.
I have taken them at rest on the large oak 
trees in Rickerby Park and at Kingmoor ; though they are never 
very plentiful anywhere.
Most of mine came from Newbiggin 
Woods, and especially from the Wreay side of the Petteril.
The 
pupa is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and of a very 
dark brown colour, coated over with a dirty-looking mud-like crust.
They may be distinguished from other pup« by the presence of 
two sharp points at only the smaller end.
This pupa is often 
neglected by the collector, because, at first sight, it has the appear- 
ance of being dead ; but its living state may be at once detected 
by pressing the pupa between the finger and thumb.
I have 
found them chiefly at the roots of the Oak and the Ash.
The Peppered Moth {Amphydasis betularid).
This is a very 
common moth here, and it may be often taken while at rest on 
trees, walls, and gas lamps.
The pupa is commonly met with in 
digging for other pupae during the winter.
They are about the 
same size as those of A.
prodromaria ; but are of a very dark 
brown, with bright cases.
The moth is on the wing in April and 
May, and is a very weak flier, looking as if its wings were heavy 
with being wet.
Fam. IV.
— BoARMiD^.
The Dotted Carpet (Cleora glabraria).
I have taken great 
numbers of this generally-rare moth in three localities here.
It is 
in great demand, and collectors will gladly exchange any of the 
other Geometers for specimens of this species.
Newman gives as 
the only British localities known to him the Lake District of 
44 
Westmorland, and the New Forest in Hampshire.
The Westmor- 
land specimens I have not seen ; but I have looked over a series 
obtained from the New Forest and from the Continent, which are 
all very much alike, but are all decidedly different from the 
specimens taken in Cumberland.
The Cumberland specimens 
are of a greenish tint, and the markings, instead of being of a 
dark grey, are black and very distinct.
Our insect too, is generally 
larger, and its body is more thickly covered with a much finer coating 
of down or hair, than in those from the South.
I think that the 
specimens recorded firom the New Forest must have been imported.
It is a very strong flier, and is on the wing from about the 15th of 
July to the middle of September.
It generally keeps to the higher 
branches of the trees in the thickest parts of the woods ; but I 
have sometimes found them sitting on the trunks of oaks in the 
day-time.
It is generally a very difficult insect to capture, as 
instead of flying out when the tree is beaten, and settling on the 
grass or on low branches near, as the other moths commonly do, 
the Dotted Carpet comes nearly to the ground, and then suddenly 
returns upward to the top of another tree near, where it is difficult 
to dislodge it a second time.
I have found it easiest to capture 
between five o'clock and seven at night.
I have found only three specimens of the larva of the Dotted 
Carpet, which were marked as described by Newman {Brit.
Moths, 
p. 63.) But it does not always feed on the lichens that grow on 
fir trees, I think, as the specimens I have taken were obtained 
from the Oak.
The Brussels Lace ( Cleora lichenarid) ; The Mottled Beauty 
{Boarmia repandatd) ; The Willow Beauty {B.
rhomboidarid) ; 
The Satin Carpet {B.
abietarid); The Small Engrailed {Tephrosia 
crepuscularid) ; The Engrailed {T.
biundularid) ; The Grey Birch 
{T.
punctulatd).
These are all to be found at Newbiggin, Newby 
Cross, and Orton ; and are on the wing from March until August.
The Satin Carpet is very common in Scotland, and is also 
widely distributed around Carlisle ; but is rare, or quite unknown, 
in any southern locality.
They are very active on the wing, and 
difficult to capture ; for even when they are detected at rest on the 
45 
trunk of a treeand an attempt is made to pin them, or to approach 
them with the killing bottle, they are apt to go off suddenly far up 
the tree, and out of reach of the net.
Of the Emeralds I have taken four species here, chiefly at 
Kingmoor, Newby Cross, Orton, Dalston, and most plentifully at 
Newbiggin.
The larvae feed on the Birch, and can easily be 
obtained by beating the trees over a large piece of wrapper sheeting 
spread on the ground, which will catch, at the same time, many 
other larvae not easily to be obtained in any other way.
Next comes the group of small moths called the Waves.
Of 
this section I have taken here twelve or more species, viz : The 
Maiden's Blush {Ephyra punctarid) ; The Birch Mocha (E.
pendu- 
larid) ; The Small Yellow Wave {Asthena luieatd) ; The Small 
White Wave {A.
candidatd); The Dingy Shell {Eupisteria heparatd) ; 
The Dark Cream Wave (Acidalia interjectarid) ; The Dotted Border 
Cream Wave (A.
straininatd) ; The Satin Wave {A.
siibsericatd) ; 
The Cream Wave (A.
re^nutatd) ; The Smoky Wave (A.
fumatd) ; 
The Ribbon Wave (A.
aversata and var.
remuiaid).
These are very plentiful at Orton and Thurstonfield, and at 
many other localities where the birch grows commonly, especially 
at Kingmoor and Newbiggin.
They are easily taken, because of 
their weak flight and their habit of flying for only a short distance.
The two varieties last mentioned I have taken together only at 
Orton.
The Latticed Heath (Stretiia dathratd) ; The Common Heath 
{Fidonia atomarid), are both common here ; The Bordered White 
{F.
piniarid) can easily be taken in great numbers on the wing in 
the fir woods here, and they are also easily reared from the pupa, 
which may be found by turning over the moss that grows on the 
ground at the foot of the fir trees, where also may be found at the 
same time the pupa of the Barred Red, and of the Noctua, the 
Trachea piniperda.
The pupa of F.
piniaria is very small in proportion to the size 
of the moth, and it is of a very light green colour with light brown 
wing cases, and a general bright aspect.
It is common at Thurston- 
46 
field, and is easily found, along with pup« of several other species, 
by peeling back the moss there.
(Abraxas grossulariaia and Lomaspilis marginata.) 
The Early Moth {Hybernia riipricaprarid) ; The Spring Usher 
(ff.
leucophearid) ; The Scarce Umber (H.
aurantiarid) ; The 
Dotted Border {H.
progemmaria) ; The Mottled Umber {H.
defol- 
iaria) ; The March Moth {Anisopteryx cescularia).
These are all 
found commonly in our woods, and some may be taken on our 
gas lamps and windows from the end of October until the middle 
of March.
The females are wingless, and have much difficulty in 
keeping out of the way of mice, and of the small birds, such as the 
Blue Tit, which destroy them in great numbers, thereby helping 
to protect our fruit trees from the ravages of these destructive 
insects.
These moths are generally plentiful at the right season 
around Rickerby, Warwick Woods, Kingmoor, and Newbiggin.
I have found the pupae of most of them by digging in August and 
September.
They are very easily reared.
I have found that the 
females considerably outnumber the males ; for, out of thirty I 
bred last year, only eight were males.
I should like to know 
whether other collectors have noticed this fact.* 
The Winter Moth ( Chimatobia brumata).
This is a very delicate 
looking little moth, resembling the last in the nearly-wingless 
condition of the female.
The larvae are one of the greatest pests 
the gardener is troubled with, for they seem to devour almost 
anything that grows in a garden.
We are troubled with two other 
such pests here besides Chhnatobia brumata, namely.
The Small 
Ermine Moth ( Yponomenta padellus), and one of the Saw Flies, 
belonging to the Hymenoptera.
The larvae of all these must be 
well known to everybody that has a piece of garden, whether the 
perfect insect is known or not.
I have paid great attention to the 
natural history of these insects for some years, and have come to 
the conclusion that the best plan for preventing their ravages is to 
* Yes ; the reason why there are more females than males is that their 
inability to escape from their pursuers by flight would long since have led to 
the extermination of the whole group, had not the initial proportion of females 
reared been adjusted so that enough individuals should escape to continue the 
species.
(Ed.
) 
47 
go round the fruit trees in the dark with a lantern, and destroy the 
females, which may be found sitting on the outer ends of the 
lower boughs of the fruit trees, and are easily taken.
Another 
good plan is to prune the fruit trees not earlier than February, and 
then to prune away and afterwards burn all the twigs that have any 
eggs upon them.
Last year I adopted this plan, and searched the 
trees two evenings a week for some time, and my fruit crop that 
year was the best we ever had.* 
With the larvae of the Saw Fly it is more difBcult to contend ; 
but the old plan of making use of powdered hellebore is the best 
I have yet been able to hear of They are double brooded, but 
the first brood does not do as much harm as the second, which 
generally clears the trees of all the leaves, and then all the fruit 
drops from the branches.
Another plan found to answer the purpose of preserving fruit 
trees from the attacks of the Winter Moth larvae is that of placing 
pieces of string coated with birdlime around the lower part of each 
tree.
In crawling up the trees for the purpose of depositing their 
eggs, the females are caught by the birdlime, and effectually pre- 
vented from reaching that part of the tree where their presence 
could be productive of any kind of harm.
A little perseverance 
with this plan will generally result in keeping the fruit trees entirely 
clear of this pest.
The other insect pest I named— the Small Ermine Moth- 
attacks the buds and the fruit blossoms of the Apple.
The larvse 
live in broods, under the shelter of a tough, silky-looking web, 
which even the Tits and the Sparrows seem unable to penetrate.
I have found it a good plan to tear the web open with a bent wire 
fastened at the end of a long stick, so as to enable the birds to get 
at and demolish the entire horde, which, unless artificially exposed 
in some such way, seems to be entirely safe from the attacks of 
even such birds as would eat them with avidity whenever they 
have an opportunity of doing so.
The Northern Winter Moth (C boreata); The November Moth 
{Oporabia dilutatd); The Autumnal Moth {O.
filigrammarid) ; 
* On this subject see Newman's British Moths, pp.
106-7.
(Ed.) 
48 
The Twin Spot Cax^^t .{Larentia didymatd); The Mottled Grey 
(Z.
mullistrigata).
These are all very common moths here, and 
they are found about all the woods and fields where their respective 
food-plants occur.
C. boreata is very like C.
brutnata, but is less 
destructive.
The females — which have the wings imperfectly 
developed, as in most of the group just described— may be found 
on thorn bushes in January and February.
The Grey Mountain Carpet {Larentia ccesiata)]; The Yellow 
Ringed Carpet (L.
ruficinctata).
These moths are very local in 
their distribution, and are rare, or absent entirely in many parts of 
the kingdom, especially in the South, I have taken them near 
Keswick, and have also met with them commonly near Buttermere, 
and again near Wasdale Head.
Other specimens I have taken at 
Barrock, and at Bleas Fell, and once took a fine specimen, about 
the end of June, from the garden wall at Wreay Mill.
[L.
ccesiata 
is very common late in June on the limestone crags at one place 
high up on the fell side east of Ousby ; but I have hardly met 
with a single specimen anywhere else, even at spots precisely 
similar that are only a hundred or so yards from the locality 
alluded to.
£d.] 
The Beech-green Carpet (L.
olivata); The Green Carpet 
(/'.
pectinitaria).
Many collectors fail to recognize L.
olivata on 
the wing, and it is not unusual to find more specimens in the 
collections of beginners and others that capture all the lepidoptera 
that come in their way, than in the cabinets of collectors of more 
experience.
I have found this one in plenty at Newbiggin Woods, 
and at Moss Pool, and have taken it also at Rickerby ; but both 
species are fairly common with us.
The Rivulet {Emmelesia affinitata) ; The Small Rivulet 
{L.
alchemillata).
Both of these little night-flying moths are local 
in occurrence; but they may be found here in the summer 
evenings, flying along the outsides of woods, and in lanes.
In the 
day time they may occasionally be met with at rest on the trunks 
of trees or on walls, but they are not easily seen.
49 
The Genus EUPITHECIA.
Of these moths, known to collectors under the general name of 
Pugs, about fifty species are enumerated in the British list, and of 
these I have taken twenty-three in Cumberland.
They are difficult 
to name, and I have sent all that I have taken to other collectors, 
so as to have them named correctly.
I have taken a great many 
in the pupa state ; and the perfect insect chiefly at rest on trees, 
walls, and fences.
Rose Castle and Newbiggin are among the 
chief localities, but I have taken them most commonly at Orton.
As a representative of the entire group, I shall choose The Green 
Pug (E.
rectcmgulata).
This is another of the moths whose larvae 
do much mischief to the apple and the pear trees.
They feed on 
the blossom of the fruit trees, as may be seen by examining the 
discoloured blossoms that fall off the trees, nipped as if by the 
frost.
These shew the small perforation and the fine silk threads that 
clearly point to the former presence of this destructive little pest.
I have seen the apple trees at St. Ann's Hill covered with blossom 
one day, and in less than a week afterwards, completely stripped 
through the ravages of the larvae of the Green Pug. The Tits and 
the Bullfinch render great service in keeping down their numbers, 
and instead of being destroyed under the impression that they 
are themselves the authors of the mischief, these birds deserve 
protection and all the encouragement the owners of fruit gardens 
can possibly afford them.* They feed also on the Crab (Pyrus 
malus), and I have found them in abundance on this tree at 
Orton.
They are also plentiful at Bellevue, where I use every 
endeavour to keep down their numbers.
The larvae are very 
active and quick-sighted, and soon make their escape when they 
are disturbed, or even when only looked at.
[Ypsipetes elutata.
Common in Cumberland.
Ed.'\ 
The Beautiful Carpet (Melanthia albicillata).
This local moth 
is found with us in all our woods around Carlisle in June, when 
they may be easily seen resting on the trunks of trees.
On the wing 
they are difficult of capture, on account of their habit of flying very 
* See the remarks upon this subject by Messrs.
Guen^e and Newman, in 
Newman's 5r;V/j^ Moths, p.
145.
(Ed.) 
4 
50 
high.
The best plan is to make use of a net with a long stick to 
it, and to place the net gently over the insect as soon as it is 
observed at rest, when it will rise, and may easily be captured.
Once on the wing, it is next to impossible to follow it through the 
undergrowth of its natural habitat.
The Argent-and-Sable Moth {Melanippe hastata) ; The Small 
Argent and-Sable Moth (M.
tristata).
Both of these locally rare 
moths I have taken in our neighbourhood.
I have them from 
Orton, Hethersgill, and Gelt Woods.
M. tristata I took in Gelt Woods in July, 1881, while collecting 
there with Mrs. Routledge of Stone House, and other members of 
this Society.
The flight of this little moth is very like that of the 
Twin Spot ; but M.
tristata settles only on the branches of trees 
instead of on the grass as the other insect does.
They are very 
strong on the wing, and in this respect resemble the Noctuas 
rather than the group they really belong to.
The Wood Carpet 
{M.
rivata) also occurs with M.
hastata and M.
tristata at Orton 
and at Gelt.
The Common Carpet (M.
suhtristata) ; The Silver Ground 
Carpet {M.
montanta) ; The Galium Carpet {M.
galiata) ; The 
Garden Carpet {M.
Jluctuata); The Royal Mantle {Anticlea 
sinuata); The Streamer (A.
derivata); The Flame Carpet {Coremia 
propugnata) ; The Tissue (Scotosia duhitata) ; The Streak (Chesias 
spartiata), and many other Geometers I have not named occur here.
Collectors from other parts of England agree with me in thinking 
that, if the Butterflies are not as well represented here as they are 
in other parts of England, the Moths — and especially the Geometers 
— are better represented here than in perhaps any other locality in 
the British Islands.
In concluding this part of my paper, I would suggest that it 
would be a good plan to have a book kept at the Museum wherein 
should be recorded opposite the names of our Lepidoptera, the 
date and locality of each capture, so that collectors in search of a 
particular insect might know when and where to go in order best 
to attain the object desired.

NOTES ON THE LAND AND FRESH-WATER SHELLS 
OF CUMBERLAND/^ \^fz^X^^^^^^en^e^,x,.U^ 
By Miss DONALD, of Stanwix.
(Read at the Carlisle Annual Meeting.) 
I HAVE collected most of the shells recorded in the subjoined list 
myself in the immediate neighbourhood of Carlisle ; but a few 
have been obtained from greater distances, where I have had 
opportunity to search for them.
I have inserted in the list the 
names of the mollusca mentioned by Dr. Gwyn Jeflfreys in his 
British Conchology, and by Capt.
Brown in his Land and Fresh- 
water Conchology, as being found in localities in Cumberland and 
Westmorland which I have been unable to visit myself.
The abundance of land-shells depends greatly upon the nature 
of the soil ; they are most plentiful on calcareous rocks.
Slates, 
grits, and igneous rocks form the higher hills of the Lake District 
in the south of the county ; north of this a lower range of hills is 
composed of alternate beds of limestone, sandstone, and shale; 
then comes a narrow strip consisting chiefly of sandstones.
The 
rocks of the remainder of the county may in a general way, be said 
to consist of the sandstones and marls of the New Red Series 
limestone only occurring again in the north-east The surface of 
the county is thickly covered with glacial drift over a wide area in 
the north-west, where but little rock crops out.
One could hardly, 
therefore, expect to find a great number of species in Cumberland, 
as but a small portion of its area is occupied by the outcrop of 
limestone.
52 
About a hundred and thirty species, besides numerous varieties, 
are recorded as British ; and of these, about seventy-five species, 
as well as many varieties, are found in Cumberland and Westmor- 
land.
Seven species only are peculiar to Westmorland, not yet 
having been taken in Cumberland.
I have no doubt that further research will cause many more 
species and varieties to be added to these; but I thought it 
advisable to draw up a few notes upon those I have already 
found.
The chief localities for fresh-water shells are the Lakes, the 
Eden and its tributaries, and numerous ponds and ditches.
Land 
shells are to be found all over the ground, and some bury them- 
selves several inches below the surface.
The pretty woods along 
the margin of our lakes and rivers may be especially mentioned as 
favourable localities for them; while others are to be found 
adhering to walls and to the bare surface of rocks, or in natural 
exposures on hill-sides.
The specimens of Helix arbustorum.
collected on the limestone 
at Bothel, are stronger than those from the Red Rocks in the 
immediate neighbourhood of Carlisle ; but there is no apparent 
difference in the solidity of the other shells on the limestone ; 
indeed, of the two varieties of H.
mfescens mentioned below, only 
the thinner one exists there.
The foreign species, Bulimus goodalli, was found in the cucumber 
beds in the Botcherby Gardens ; and I am indebted to Mr. Duck- 
worth for my acquaintance with this, for he kindly gave me some 
specimens.
Mr. Turton says that B.
goodalli inhabits Guadaloupe, 
and has been naturalised in Bourbon and England.
It was first 
introduced into the Fauna, and indeed first described in 1822, by 
Mr. Miller, who found it in some pine-beds at Bristol.
It is also 
common in the same situations in the neighbourhood of London 
especially in Kensington Palace garden ; and has been found near 
Manchester by Mr. Williamson.
It was first observed by the late 
Mr. Drummond, the botanist, in 1816.

This is the commonest species of 
Planorbis in this neighbourhood.
It swarms in ditches near the 
Water Works, in Rickerby Beck, and in a pond near the Eden at 
Rickerby.
On a bright day the animals rise to the surface of the 
water, and it is very interesting to watch them and P.
spirorbis 
swimming about with their shells downwards.
P. coritortus, L.
Not common.
Derwentwater, Rickerby Beck, and in a 
ditch near the Water Works.
Physa hypnorum, L.
Pretty well distributed.
Ditches near the Water 
Works and at Rockliffe ; ponds at Rickerby and Blaithwaite.
P. fontinalis, L, Common.
The finest specimens may be obtained in a 
stream near the Water Works.
It is also found in Rickerby Beck.

Very common.
May be found in nearly every lake, 
stream, and ditch.
There are several different forms of this species 
besides those mentioned below, which I beUeve may be named 
varieties that I am not yet acquainted with.
One specimen, taken 
in a ditch near the Water Works, has a remarkably reflected outer 
lip.
A small strong variety occurs in the Eden and Petteril.

Common.
In the Eden ; at Blaithwaite ; and very 
abundant on the mud at the edge of ditches near the Water Works 
and of Eickerby Beck.
I have found a shorter shell, with more 
swollen whorls, and so much coated with iron as to be nearly black, 
in a ditch in the Abbey Holme.
var.
minor.
On pieces of limestone in the Roman vallum near Laner- 
cost, and also on pieces of limestone in a quarry at Bothel.
The 
stones are lying on the damp ground, and there is no water in 
either locality.
L. glabra, Mull.
I have only taken this shell in a ditch at Corby, where it 
is abundant.
The specimens are fine, but are aU decollated.
Ancylus fluviatilis, Mull.
Common.
In the rivers Eden, Caldew, Roe, 
Petteril, and Irthing, attached to stones.

Fam. Limacidai.
ArioH ater, L.
Very common.
May be found nearly everywhere, especially 
just before or after rain.
Black is the commonest colour ; and the 
young ones are pale green.
In Scotland I liave met with this 
mollusk not far from the summit of Ben Lomond, near a spring, on 
a very dry, hot day.
Stanwix, Grinsdale, Wetheral, Blaithwaite, 
&c.
A. hortensk, Fer. Common at Stanmx and Blaithwaite.

Common and abundant.
Ditch near the Water Works; 
Wreay ; Gelt ; and very small ones in a pond at Blaithwaite.
S. pfeifferi, Rossm.
; var.
parviila, Pascal.
I found some small specimens of 
Succinea adhering to wood at the edge of Eickerby Beck which 
answered to the description of 8.
pfeifferi in Turton's "British 
Shells.
" The shell is much smaller than that of S.
putris, and 
pearly in the interior ; and the spire is less produced than that of 
S. elegans.
I forwarded the shell to Mrs. Fitzgerald, who kindly 
determined it to be S.
pfeifferi, var.
parvula.
Vitrina pellucida, Mull.
Generally distributed ; but the individuals are not 
numerous.
Dead specimens are more abundant than live ones.
Stanwix, Wreay, Sandysike, Blaithwaite, Patterdale.

tributed.
The commonest form is small and very flat above, and 
may be the var.

Stanwix, Grinsdale, Wetheral, 
Wreay, and Gelt, 
var.
albida.
Rare.
Wetheral and Stanwix.
Z. alliarius, Miller.
Generally distributed.
The presence of this shell can 
generally be detected by the strong smell of garlic it emits.
Z. glaber, Studer.
This snail was first discovered in this country by Mr.
Thomas Rogers of Manchester, in 1870.
Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys recorded 
it as British in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History in 
May of that year ; and also states that he had previously found it 
at Grasmere, but had overlooked it.
I found some snails at 
Wetheral which I thought were this species, so I forwarded them 
to Mr. Rogers, who kindly identified them as L.
glaber.
I believe 
this is the first record of L.
glaber being found in Cumberland.
Mr. Rimmer, in his "Land and Fresh-water Shells," says that it 
has a wide range, and that he has found it both in Devonshire and 
Dumfriesshire.
Z. nitidulus, Drap.
Very common, and widely distributed.
It may be 
found in nearly every hedgerow, bank, and wood.
Very plentiful 
on the rockery in our garden ; Stanwix, Wetheral, Wreay, Grins- 
dale, Blaithwaite, &c.

In Wreay, Blaithwaite, and Grinsdale 
Woods.
H. aspersa, Mull.
This snail, generally so common in other places, is quite 
a rarity in the neighbourhood of Carlisle.
I have found a few 
specimens on the bank by the Hyssop Holme Well, and have 
observed a dead shell on the Scaur.
var.

Miss J.
Hele has taken this shell at Harraby on a wall.
ff, nemoralis, L.
Much more common than II.
aspersa, and widely dis- 
tributed.
I find it and the var.
hortensis together in great numbers 
on the Scaur among the grass and willows.
Some of the shells 
are entirely yellow or pinkish in colour, while others are variously 
banded ; and one taken on the Brampton Eoad is somewhat thinner 
than usual.
Other localities are SiUoth, Bothel, and Tarraby.
var.
hortensis, Mull.
Abundant on the Scaur.
Many of the shells are 
ornamented with dark coloured bands of different widths, while 
some are greenish yellow, and others yellow without bands.
Some 
of the yellow coloured shells are very thin and transparent.
I have 
also obtained yellow shells without bands in the woods near High 
Head Castle.
The older specimens of this moUusk thrive pretty 
well in confinement, but the young ones generally die.
I have 
observed it crawling about on a mild day in winter at Heads-Nook.
var.
hybrida, Poiret.
Very scarce.
Corby Woods.
H. arbustorum, L.
Abundant in the neighbourhood of Carlisle.
They are 
very plentiful in a lane near the Spa Well, where they may be 
seen feeding on nettles, thistles, and the young leaves of the wild 
cherry.
II.
arbustorum thrives well in confinement.
I have kept 
an adult specimen alive for more than eighteen months ; its shell 
was mucli broken, and it has gradually mended it, with the excep- 
tion of a small bit of the inner lip.

Very common.
I find two distinct varieties ; one 
of which is light coloured, nearly white, marked transversely with 
reddish brown blotches, and has a white spiral band ; the shell is 
thin, and usually very flat above.
The other variety is decidedly 
.stronger, dark brown with sometimes a reddish tinge, but not 
marked transversely like the other, and generally destitute of the 
white band.
The spire of this variety is raised, though that of 
some specimens is nearly as flat as the other variety.

be found at Kendal.
H. rotundata, Mull.
This and L.
nitidulus are the commonest snails in the 
district.
H. rotundata may be found on nearly every hedge and 
bank.
I have also seen it in great abundance on old walls covered 
with ivy.
Stanwix, Blaithwaite, Wetheral, Wreay, Bothel, Arma- 
thwaite, &c.
H. rupestrls, Studer.
I have never met with this shell on the Red Rocks 
in the neighbourhood of Carlisle.
It occcurs in great abundance 
on the limestone at Bothel and Castle Carrock ; also on the Brock- 
ram at Burrels, near Appleby, which rock is chiefly composed of 
59 
fragments of limestone.
This snail is found at great heights, and 
seems to be equally unmindful of the heat of the sun and the rigour 
of winter.
It was plentiful at Barrels during intensely cold 
weather, just after a recent snow-storm had left the neighbouring 
hiUs covered with snow.
It may also be found on the walls of the- 
churchyards at Bowness, Windermere, and Troutbeck.
Dr. Gwyn 
Jeffreys gives Kendal as another locality.

Rare at Corby ; more 
plentiful on the limestone at Castle Carrock and Bothel.
I have 
also taken it on the terrace walls at High Head Castle, and at 
Gatesgill.
Pupa secale, Drap.
I have not yet met with this snail in Cumberland.
Dr. Gwyn Jeffi-eys states that it is to be found in Westmorland.
P. umbilicata, Drap.
Common, and widely distributed.
Nearly everywhere 
at the roots of grass, among moss and on walls.
Stanwix, Heads- 
Nook, Wetheral, Eose Castle, Bothel, Patterdale, &c.
P. marginata, Drap.
Scarce.
I have only found one specimeo, in a 
Brockram quarry at Burrels, near Appleby.
Vertigo pygmcea, Drap.
Very abundant on the limestone at Bothel.
I have 
also taken it at Burrels, near Appleby, and on Troutbeck church- 
yard waU.
V. alpestris, Alder.
I have not yet taken this sheU in Cumberland.
Dr.
Gwyn Jeffreys, in his "British Conohology," states that it has 
been found by Miss Sarah Bolton on slate near Ambleside.
In 
" Science Gossip," 1880, p.
216, Mr. Sutton offers for exchange 
specimens taken in Patterdale.
V. pusilla, Mull.
I have not taken this shell in Cumberland.
Dr. Gwyn 
Jeffreys says that it is to be found in various parts of Great Britain 
from Westmorland to Devon.
V. edentula, Drap.
Abundant, and fairly well distributed.
It abounds on 
the back of the fronds of Lastrea dilatata in Wreay and High 
Head Woods.
It seems to have a partiality for this fern, for I 
rarely find it on any other.
I have taken it on Lastrea Jilix-mas 
in Grinsdale Woods, where there are few if any roots of Lastrea 
dilatata; and on the Stanwix Marls in the same locality.
It 
occurs also among moss at Blaithwaite and Bothel, but not 
nearly so plentifully as on Lastrea dilatata.
My brother found an 
elongated shell in High Head Wood which I think must be the 
var.
columella.
60 
Balia pviversa, L.
Somewhat scarce.
On walls in Borrowdale and Patter- 
dale.
Clausula rugosa, Drap.
Common, and well distributed.
Some of the 
varieties are also to be found, I fancy.
It abounds on the east side 
of the breakwater below Edentown, where most of the specimens 
are bleached.
Other localities are — Grinsdale, Wreay, Corby, 
Rose Castle, Gatesgill, Bothel, and Troutbeck.
C. laminata, Mont.
Rare.
I have taken two specimens on the Stanwix 
Marls ; in Grinsdale Woods ; and two dead shells in High 
Gelt Woods.
The former were not full grown, so I kept them 
alive for eighteen months, when the mouths were completed.
Gochlicopa tridenn, Pulteney.
Plentiful in Wetheral and Grinsdale Woods 
among moss.
(It may be observed that both localities are on the 
banks of the Eden.) In Wetheral Woods I have taken on the 
same bank shells varying in colour from brown, paler shades of the 
same colour, light horn to transparent greenish white,

THE GLACIAL DEPOSITS OF WEST CUMBERLAND.

I. Introduction.
Physical Geography.
The surface of West Cumberland is in 
form extremely varied, and it has a great range of altitude — 
extending from the sea shore to more than 3000 feet above that 
level.
Along the eastern part of the district stand some of the largest 
mountains of the Lake Country.
In the West and North West, 
between these mountains and the sea, the ground is much lower, 
lying almost entirely below the five hundred feet contour line, and 
much of it is within one hundred feet of the sea level.
This low 
ground forms, at the base of the large mountains, a kind of 
undulating terrace having a general inclination seaward.
Inland extensions of this lower ground are formed by the valleys 
which traverse the mountainous part of the district.
In some 
cases these valleys lead almost to the very heart of the higher 
ground.
The valleys in the lower ground, when they have certain direc- 
tions, are as a rule steeper on one side than on the other ; and 
generally it is found that the more gentle slopes face the sea, whilst 
the steeper slopes oppose the mountains towards the East.
62 
Physical Geology.
The geographical feature just pointed out, 
of high ground in the East and low ground in the West, is the 
accompaniment and the result of a change in the geological 
character of the two areas; the high ground being formed of 
Skiddaw Slate and the Volcanic rocks of Borrowdale, and the low 
ground of rocks of Carboniferous and of Permian age.
Within the area occupied by the Skiddaw Slate and the volcanic 
rocks, that is, among the mountains, there occur, at different 
places, patches of rocks of various kinds, each presenting characters 
so peculiar, that once they have become thoroughly known, they 
may be recognised anywhere.
Boulders of these rocks are of 
frequent occurrence in the drifts hereafter to be described.
(The 
positions of the rocks were indicated in the author's paper on 
" The Distribution of Boulders," &c.
See Transactions, Part V., 
and they are shewn on Fig. 1 1 herewith.
The Carboniferous and Permian rocks occurring in the lower 
ground are developed as below : —

2 Millstone Grit reddish grey

The St. Bees Sandstone, the Permian Breccia, and the White- 
haven Sandstone, being harder rocks than those forming the bulk 
of the Coal Measures, frequently occupy higher ground and form 
the ridges separating valleys, whilst the softer Coal Measures 
appear in the sides and bottom of valleys.
The general dip of the Carboniferous and Permian rocks is 
toward the sea, its direction varying, but being everywhere nearly 
normal to the line separating the higher from the lower ground.
63 
These few prefatory remarks are intended to render more clear 
the observations that are to follow.
2. Observed Facts.
Extent of Deposits.
The deposits to be considered approxi- 
mately correspond with the area of the lower ground skirting the 
base of the hills.
They may be said to be almost continuous 
from the sea shore up to the five hundred feet contour line.
Above that level they extend at a few places over small areas to 
about eight hundred feet; and in tongue-like prolongations, up 
valley bottoms and hillside gullies, they reach, and in some cases 
pass beyond, looo feet.
I speak now of the Boulder clays and 
the sands and gravels only, for glacial deposits in the form of 
Boulders and moraines occur, in places, at twice the above altitude, 
as will hereafter be seen.
The valleys passing inward, from the lower ground, through the 
mountains, contain but few deposits comparatively, even when the 
bottom of such valleys is far below the five hundred feet contour 
line, the height fixed above as the upper limit of the continuous 
drift.
The main mass of the deposits is outside the mountains 
altogether.
Form of Deposits.
Where fullest developed, the glacial deposits 
of this district admit of a threefold division as below : — 
1. Upper Boulder Clay.
2. Middle Sands and Gravels.
3. Lower Boulder Clay.
Numerous sections have at one time or another been laid open 
in railway cuttings and other places, shewing these three members 
in superposition; but for the present purpose it will only be 
necessary to consider a few of them, as they are all very much 
alike in their inner nature.
Fig. i is a cross section of a cutting 
on the Cleator and Workington Railway, near Cleator Moor.
The 
longitudinal section of this cutting is a low flattened dome, and 
the band of interbedded sand and clay (B and C) runs almost 
throughout, passing out of sight at each end of the cutting below 
the formation of the railway.
Where seen, the band is roughly 
64 
parallel to the surface of the ground.
This feature I have very 
frequently observed in other places ; in one case, near Moresby, 
on the Ullock and Parton Branch of the London and North 
Western Railway, it was so notwithstanding that the longitudinal 
section of the cutting resembled a steep-sided dome as shewn in 
Fig. 2.
Fig. 3 represents a section that was exposed near Walk Mill, in 
the highway which was altered during the construction of the 
Cleator and Workington Railway.
There also the two Boulder 
clays and the interbedded sands and gravels were to be seen.
This tripartite form of the deposits is most frequently met with 
in valley bottoms overlying the Coal Measures, or in similar situ- 
ations over limestone or sandstone where they are adjacent to 
rocks of an argillaceous character.
At places, in any of these 
positions, the deposits may be found with an aggregate thickness 
of more than one hundred feet.
At Salter Hall, on the Carbon- 
iferous Limestone, but not far from the Skiddaw Slate on the rise, 
they are, at one point, one hundred and thirty-two feet thick.
On 
the Coal Measures near Keekle, they are one hundred and eight 
feet thick ; and on the same formation near Crossfield, they have 
a thickness of one hundred and twenty-three feet.
Frequently the triad form of the deposits is incomplete, and 
only one or two of the members are represented.
Sometimes only 
the Lower Boulder Clay is found.
In other sections this layer is 
capped by the Middle Sands and Gravels, which in such cases are 
often more fully developed than when they occur between the two 
clays, as in Figs, i, 2, 3.
Fig. 4 is a section of the Middle Sands and Gravels, as seen in 
a tramway cutting near Crossfield.
The upper clay is absent, but 
the lower clay, though not shewn in the section, occurs just below 
the formation line of the tramway.
At Salter Hall there is a well marked instance of the thickening 
of the Middle Sands and Gravels where the upper clay is absent 
as just mentioned.
Between the two clays the sands and gravels 
seldom exceed four or five feet in thickness ; but in one or two 
places where the upper clay is off, they are above twenty feet 
thick.
65 
In some cases the line of separation between the Lower Boulder 
Clay and the Middle Sands and Gravels is somewhat indistinct, 
and the two beds are partly mixed together, as shewn in Fig. 5, 
which represents a section seen near Branthwaite edge, on the 
Ullock and Parton Branch of the London and North Western 
Railway.
The transition from the Boulder Clay (C) to the upper- 
most bed of coarse gravel and boulders (B) was in some parts of 
this section so very gradual that it was impossible to say where 
one ended and the other began.
Imperfections, such as the above, in the tripartite arrangement 
of the deposits, I have found most frequently on the sides of valleys 
or on the ridge separating two valleys.
Thus, from the bottom of 
a valley where the whole three members of the series are present, 
we may frequently, on passing up the sides of that valley, see the 
upper clay disappear altogether, and the Middle Sands and Gravels 
come out at the surface.
Farther up again the Lower Boulder 
Clay may be next the surface — the Middle Sands and Gravels, as 
well as the Upper Boulder Clay, having disappeared.
The Middle Sands and Gravel, where they present any appear- 
ance of bedding, are often curiously contorted, both when they lie 
next the surface and when they are covered by the Upper Boulder 
Clay.
It has been already mentioned that the ridges separating valleys 
on the lower ground are often capped by either St. Bees Sandstone, 
Permian Breccia, or Whitehaven Sandstone.
When this is the 
case, the superimposed glacial deposits are, as a rule, extremely 
scanty, seldom exceeding five or six feet in thickness, and, so far 
as my experience goes, they are undivided ; that is to say, they 
are not split up like the deposits shewn in Figs, i, 2, 3, into 
different layers, but occur as one layer only.
Whether this single 
undivided layer, which usually presents the general characters of 
boulder clay, is the equivalent of the Upper- or of the Lower 
boulder clay, or of both, as they occur in the valleys, I have not 
been able to determine by observation.
In many cases the deposits are accumulated mainly on one side 
of a valley, as shewn in Fig. 6, which is a section taken through 
5 
66 
part of the Whitehaven Hematite Mining District, where so many- 
explorations have been made by boring and sinking, that a very 
accurate idea of the disposition of the Glacial deposits can be 
formed.
On the seaward side of valleys on the line of strike, the 
rocks may be concealed only by a thin layer of the Upper Boulder 
Clay, whilst on the opposite side of such valley there may be an 
immense deposit representing each of the three divisions.
In the valleys winding through the mountainous part of the 
district, I have never seen the tripartite arrangement of the deposits.
Isolated patches of boulder clay occur here and there, having 
sometimes the characters of the Lower Boulder Clay, at others 
resembUng the Upper Clay ; but the more prominent deposits in 
these valleys assume the form either of mounds of sand and gravel 
or of moraines.
One of these sand and gravel deposits may be seen in the Vale 
of Keswick, near Castle Head.
A section of it is given in Fig. 7.
Another occurs in the Vale of Lorton, and is represented in section 
by Fig. 8, and they may be found more or less frequently in almost 
every valley in the hilly part of the district.
Similar accumulations, but generally of much greater extent, are 
frequently met with where these valleys open out on to the lower 
ground.
In the mouth of Whicham Valley there is a large mound- 
like mass of sand and gravel, and several smaller ones near it.
At 
Ullock there are numerous mounds of the same kind, one of them 
forming a dam to Mockerkin Tarn.
In the mouth of Ennerdale 
there are a number of like deposits, and they may be found almost 
everywhere in similar situations.
As a rule, they occur mainly on 
one side of the valley.
For instance, the deposit in Whicham 
Valley lies close up to the side of Black Comb, the other side of 
the valley being almost free.
The deposits in the mouth of Enner- 
dale occur on the same relative side of that valley, that is, on the 
the north side.
A like relation exists in the Ullock deposits.
Sometimes in the lower ground lying between the hills and the 
sea, where valleys open out on to lower ground still, similar 
mound-like deposits occur.
A large one may be seen at the south 
end of St. Bees Valley, numerous sections of which have been 
produced by the cutting action of the sea.
One of these sections 
is represented in Fig. 9.
Accumulations of gravel are occasionally met with on the ridge 
between two valleys j^one of these occurs near Cockhow, on the 
water-shed between the head of Ulldale and of Ennerdale, at an 
altitude of about seven hundred feet.
At the upper end of some of the mountain valleys, clusters of 
moraine-like mounds are met with.
One of the most interesting 
of these occurs in Greenup Gill, at the head of Borrowdale.
A 
perspective sketch of it is given in Fig. 10.
An equally interesting 
group occurs at the upper end of Ennerdale, and another in Long- 
strath.
True glacial moraines are met with among the hills.
Sometimes 
at considerable altitudes they may be seen on the ridges dividing 
two valleys.
At Ore-gap, on the water-shed between Green Hole 
and Angle Tarn, on the flanks of Bowfell, at an elevation of 2500 
feet, there occurs a long, low and irregular mass of morainic matter, 
the nature of which closely resembles the terminal or lateral 
moraines of Swiss Glaciers.
Such are the different forms assumed by the deposits.
The 
next feature to be considered is their inner nature.
Inner Nature of Deposits.
In examining the inner nature of 
most of the deposits that have just been described, so far as relates 
to their form, almost the first thing that obtrudes itself before the 
attention of an observer is the mixed character of the boulders 
they contain.
(See Transactions, Part V.) 
The curious commingling of boulders from different sources, as 
they occur in the Upper- and Lower Boulder Clays, will be best 
understood by putting in tabular form the contents of these beds 
as they are found at several places in the district.

The boulders occurring in the Middle Sands and Gravels are as 
much mixed as those in the Upper- and the Lower Boulder Clays, 
and, generally, they are of the same kinds of rock in the three 
members of any given section.
In the boulder clays, the sand and gravel mounds, and the 
moraines occuring in the valleys of the higher ground, there is not 
this mingling of boulders of different kinds of rocks from various 
directions.
Usually they are only of rocks found higher up the 
valley in which the deposit is situated.
When gravel mounds occur at the mouth of a valley, there is 
sometimes a mingling of boulders from opposite directions, that is, 
from both up and down the valley, as near Whicham Hall ; but 
this is not invariably the case.
The vertical range through which the rocks met with in the 
glacial deposits occur both in place and as boulders is shewn by

The horizontal range of the more important boulders is shewn 
by Fig. II.
Only a few are shewn, to prevent overcrowding 
These few are intended rather to indicate the directions of boulder 
dispersal than the number of each kind found.
In the moraines and moraine-like mounds the boulders are 
either angular or sub-angular.
In the sand and gravel mounds 
and in the Middle Sands and Gravels, they are angular, sub-angular, 
and rounded.
So are they in the Upper- and the Lower Boulder 
Clays ; but the number of rounded boulders, which are often 
severely glaciated, is much greater in the Lower- than in the 
Upper clay ; and, as a rule, the boulders are larger in the Lower 
than in the Upper clay, and there are more of them.
Sometimes 
a boulder of hard rock, rounded and glaciated, may be seen lying, 
embedded in boulder clay, by the side of a piece of soft shale, 
quite angular, and readily acted on by either pressure or the 
atmosphere.
The proportion of local- to far-travelled stones in the deposits 
varies ; sometimes they are nearly equal in numbers, in other cases 
the local rocks preponderate, particularly when the underlying 
strata are of a sandy nature.
Then the included stones are mostly 
of the same kind as the rocks below, and they are nearly all 
angular, except the few far-travelled ones which are associated with 
them in the deposit.
The size of the boulders included in any of the deposits varies 
extremely — ranging from pieces of rock less than an inch in 
70 
diameter up to stones weighing several tons.
Some of the largest 
in the different kinds of deposits may here be mentioned.
In the 
boulder clays stones three feet in diameter are frequently met with, 
and occasionally they may be seen as large as six feet.
In the 
Middle Sands and Gravels they are generally smaller, although a 
few of the size just named may be met with.
In the sand and 
gravel mounds, as well as in the moraines, there are also some large 
boulders.
In the section shown in Fig. 9, boulders three and four 
feet in'^diameter are common ; and some are nearly twice that 
size.
In the section represented by Fig. 8, boulders three feet in 
diameter have been seen.
The moraines at the head of valleys' 
and on ridges between valleys, also enclose some large stones, 
plenty of them^being two feet or three feet in diameter.
In all the deposits noticed, there seems to be no absolute 
arrangement of the stones, except in some of the more bedded 
sands and gravels, in which the larger axis of the stones is roughly 
in the line of bedding ; but in most other cases the stones lie in 
all directions.
Sometimes flag-like pieces of stone may be seen 
standing on end in both the Upper- and the Lower Boulder Clay.
The character of the matrix of the boulder clay is variable, but 
it may be stated as a rule that the lower clay is much more 
argillaceous than the upper one, and it is much stiffer or tougher.
Over sandstone rocks the matrix is usually very sandy.
The colour of the upper clay is generally a yellowish grey, but 
that of the lower clay varies, partaking in a great measure of the 
colour of the underlying rocks.
When they are red, the matrix of 
the over-lying boulder clay is also red.
When the subjacent rocks 
incline to blue or black, like the Coal Measures, then the clay is 
bluish grey.
On the Whitehaven Sandstone, which is reddish 
grey, the sandy matrix of the Boulder Clay has the same colour as 
the underlying rock.
This correspondence in the colour of the lower clay and the 
rocks below it does not, however, prevail everywhere.
It some- 
times happens that the colour of this clay is not influenced at all 
by the colour of the underlying rock, but has the colour of some 
adjacent rock which, so far as I have observed, always lies to the 
71 
eastward.
Take the section shewn in Fig. i as an instance.
It 
is underlaid by Coal Measures ; but the colour of the lower clay 
in that section is like that of clay found overlying Carboniferous 
Limestone, which rock actually occurs about a third of a mile to 
the east of the point at which Fig. i was taken.
Then again, the 
clay overlying the Permian Breccia near Low Wreah is coloured 
reddish grey, like the Whitehaven Sandstone ; whilst the Breccia 
is a deep red.
Whitehaven Sandstone, however, occurs a short 
distance away in an easterly direction.
Associated Phenomena.
As bearing on the subject under con- 
sideration, It may be of advantage to make a few observations on 
the grooving, smoothing, and rounding which certain rocks in the 
district have undergone.
These phenomena are confined to the 
higher parts of the district, and may be best seen where the rocks 
are hardest, as for instance on the Eskdale Granite and the 
Volcanic rocks of the Borrowdale Series.
The grooving has already been carefully worked out by the late 
Rev. J.
C. Ward, and therefore little need be said about it here.
As a rule, the grooves correspond in direction with that of the 
valley in which they occur.
There are however some exceptions 
to this in which the grooves or striae are sometimes nearly, at other 
times quite, at right angles to the valleys.
This being so in some 
cases on very high ground.
Of the rounding and smoothing of rocks there are some very 
fine examples, especially in Eskdale and Borrowdale.
Generally 
these effects are produced on the up -valley side of rocks ; but in 
one place, on the side of Great Arming How, opposite Boot, in 
Eskdale, they are on the down-valley side.
In Borrowdale, beside the well-known "Sow's Back" at Grange, 
there are numerous interesting pieces of rock rounding and 
smoothing.
One of these is shewn in section in Fig. 12.
Sometimes this smoothing and rounding may be seen beneath 
deposits of boulder clay.
Nowhere can the rounding be seen over a large area ; it occurs 
interruptedly, on knolls and small bosses of rock.
The general 
outline of the valleys is not now affected by it.
Such are some of the more saUent points presented by the 
glacial deposits of West Cumberland.
The deductions to be 
drawn from them are numerous, and may now be considered.
3. Deductions.
Origin of Lower Boulder Clay.
The first inference to be drawn 
from the facts just described is that floating ice seems to have 
played a most important part in the formation of all the deposits 
that have been noticed.
The mingling of boulders from different 
sources, sometimes in quite opposite directions, as shewn in 
Fig. II, cannot be explained in any other way.
And since these 
variously-derived boulders are found side by side in both the 
Upper- and the Lower Boulder Clay, it follows that floating ice 
must have been largely concerned in forming these deposits.
But 
a difficulty occurs here.
The matrix of the Lower Boulder Clay is 
clearly local, having, no doubt, been derived from rocks very near 
where it now lies, whence its sandy character when over-lying 
rocks that are sandy, 'and its clayey nature when resting on rocks 
that are argillaceous.
Many of the included stones are also of 
local origin.
These results could only have been brought about 
by glacier-action, so that there is in every deposit of Lower Boulder 
Clay the results of the action of ice in two very different forms — 
as icebergs, by which many of the local and far-travelled Ktones 
were deposited, and as glaciers, which produced the matrix of the 
deposit ; and also imbedded therein, many of the local boulders, 
as well as some of the far-travelled ones, the'source of which was in 
the direction whence the glacier moved.
Fig. 13, which is a sketch-section of a glacier terminating in the 
sea, will illustrate the manner in which I conceive these actions to 
have taken place.
In its downward motion the glacier would pass into the sea at B, 
and would move along the sea-bottom until it arrived at C, where 
the weight of ice in the glacier would equal that of the sea-water 
displaced.
Thence it would leave the sea-bottom and float on 
toward D, where in all probability it would be broken off into 
icebergs, and be borne away by currents to other places.

moving glacier would denude — partly by abrasion, and partly by 
the removal of fragments of different sizes^the rocky bed over 
which it passed.
Some of the powdery material produced by 
abrasion of the rocks lying above the sea level, would be carried 
down by the subglacial streams to the sea.
But the quantity thus 
deposited would not be great, as the formation of this powder 
would be mainly confined to those parts of the glacier-bed where 
there was a sufficient quantity of water, passing down from the 
surface of the glacier, to remove the comminuted matter as it was 
formed.
In other places, where, from the absence of crevasses, there 
was no running water below, the accumulation of fine powder 
would soon put an end to abrasion of the underlying rocks in the 
same way that we know it does in certain operations in the Arts.
Take for instance the sharping of a joiner's chisel.
But for the 
application of oil to gather up and localise in a small compass the 
material rubbed off the stone, the joiner would be long in edging 
his chisel.
Reverting to Fig. 13, between B and C the case is different.
The mud formed there — unlike that formed at the higher part of 
the glacier-bed — could not be washed away by a stream, but it 
would be squeezed out at the end of the glacier and be deposited 
partly on the sea bottom in front, and partly beneath the floating 
end of the glacier, so that the rock between B and C would always 
be clean for the ice to act upon.
The mud already referred to as 
being brought down by subglacial streams from the upper end of 
the glacier, and which would have a tendency to deposit on 
entering the sea, owing to its motion being arrested, would also be 
pressed out to the front of the glacier, and be deposited along with 
the locally-formed mud.
Many of the rocky fragments included in the glacier would be 
similarly carried forward and deposited in the mud in front of the 
glacier.
Some of these fragments might be from the upper end of 
the valley, and either have been torn up by the glacier from its 
bed, or, having first fallen on to the surface of the glacier, might 
afterwards have found their way to the bottom of it through 
crevasses.
Other fragments might remain on the surface of the 
ice until it assumed the form of bergs, and then be'deposited.
Many pieces of rock would, in all probability, be detached from 
the glacier bed on what is now the lower ground.
They too would 
be deposited in the mud issuing from beneath the glacier.
It was previously mentioned that the rocks in the lower ground 
dip seaward.
Their broken ends thus oppose the mountains 
whence came the glaciers, so that a glacier, moving outward over 
the lower ground, would, in certain parts of its course, as for 
instance where the ends of strata cropped out in the side of a 
valley, have the best possible chance of tearing up rock fragments 
from its bed.
Again, rocks from totally different localities might 
be borne on icebergs, which in time, through the influence of 
currents, might be so mingled as to drop their stony contents at or 
near the same place.
Thus we get an explanation of all the main facts presented by 
the Lower Boulder Clay.
The mingling of the boulders and the 
local derivation of the clay are both satisfactorily accounted for.
Those curious facts mentioned by Mr. James Geikie as occurring 
in other localities are also explained.
I refer to streams of boulders 
embedded in the lower clay, and but little removed from their 
parent rock, as if they had just been torn up from the glacier bed 
and dragged away in a string by the ice.
Other phenomena, such 
as the occurrence in the clay of flag-like fragments of rock standing 
on end also receive an explanation.
It is only the lower part of 
the clay that would be formed under the glacier, that is as a 
moraine profonde ; the upper part of the clay would be deposited 
outside the glacier altogether, and rock fragments falling there 
might be expected to be imbedded vertically as well as horizontally, 
but such a thing could not occur in a moraine profonde.
It has been asserted by some that the tough character of the 
lower clay is due to the kneading it received under the glaciers ; 
but that is not so, for I have seen clay as tough as any boulder- 
clay in lough-holes twenty fathoms below the upper surface of the 
solid rock, probably having been washed down joints from the 
overlying glacial deposits.
Again, the matrix of boulder-clay, after 
it has been taken up by water and thrown down in another place, 
75 
is as stiff as it was before, as I know from having frequently cut 
through it in old mine workings.
The courses taken by some of the boulders in the lower clay, 
whilst travelling from their parent rock, are shewn in Fig. ii.
The 
different currents by which the boulder-bearing bergs were swept 
along, probably came into existence at different stages of submer- 
gence.
With a subsidence of nine hundred feet, there would be 
a water passage from the southern part of the Lake District through 
by Dunmail Raise and St. John's Vale, to the northern part of that 
district.
A northward current through this strait would carry with 
it bergs laden with Armboth- and St. John's Quartz-Felsite, which, 
subject to the effect" of other influences, might turn towards either 
Keswick or Penrith, or through by Mosedale to Caldbeck, where 
the operation of other currents might change their course and 
carry them through the Tyne Valley, or southward along the 
western foot of the hilly ground by Maryport, Whitehaven, and 
Ravenglass, on into Furness.
A further submergence of seven 
hundred feet would form a water passage over Stainmoor, Thus 
an explanation is forthcoming of the occurrence of Lake District 
boulders in that locality.
If now it be assumed that there was a gradual submergence of 
the district under consideration at the time that the Lower Boulder 
Clay was formed, there is at hand a complete explanation of all 
the facts hitherto observed in the district.
For then the glaciers 
would gradually recede, and icebergs from other localities would 
float over and drop their contents on to ground that was but 
recently occupied by those glaciers, and so produce the observed 
mingling of boulders from sources sometimes lying in very different 
directions from the point at which they are enveloped in the clay.
Origin of the Middle Sands and Gravels.
The Middle Sands 
and Gravels may have resulted partly from the action of the sea 
on the Lower Boulder Clay during a period of gradual emergence, 
and partly from the action of rivers and streams.
The angularity 
of many of the stones in the gravel and the coarseness of some of 
the sand being probably due in a great measure to the comparative 
76 
absence of wave motion in the sea, owing to the presence of icefloes 
on its surface, or to the rapidity of the emergence.
Origin of the Upper Boulder Clay.
The Upper Boulder Clay 
was probably formed in the same manner as the Lower Boulder 
Clay, but during a second submergence of the land.
The receding 
glaciers would then move over the Middle Sands and Gravels, 
which would no doubt, in some cases, be contorted, in others 
removed altogether.
At the same time the Lower Boulder Clay 
might be denuded in places, especially on valley sides facing the 
moving glacier.
The sands, gravels, and boulder clay over which 
the glaciers moved this time being everywhere nearly uniform in 
mineralogical character, the resulting clay would no doubt be ot 
the same colour throughout, and be more sandy than the lower 
clay, owing to the presence of sandstone boulders in the beds 
over which the glaciers passed.
These inferences are in strict 
correspondence with the results of observation.
An explanation which requires two submergences to produce 
the tripartite form of the deposits is no doubt complicated ; but 
nevertheless, it seems right, for I have elsewhere shewn from positive 
observation, that in the neighbouring district of Furness there 
occurred an inter-glacial period of sufficient duration for the 
accumulation of immense quantities of vegetable matter character- 
istic of a temperate climate ; so that two invasions of the glaciers 
seem necessary, and consequently two recessions of the same.
Origin of Mounds of Sands and Gravels.
The mounds of sand 
and gravel occurring at the mouth of valleys probably originated 
at a time when the glaciers were shrinking back into the hills, and 
the Upper Boulder Clay was being formed.
Sea-currents having 
the directions indicated by the boulder dispersal, would move 
right across the mouth of most of the valleys, which would at that 
time be fiords.
The water in those fiords would be almost motion- 
less, except near the mouth, where there would be an eddy, produced 
by the current outside striking against the farther point of the fiord, 
and being thereby deflected inward, as shewn in Fig. 14.
Bergs passing 
along the coast outside the fiord would no doubt often find their 
77 
way into this eddy and be thereby detained, in the same way as 
pieces of wood are detained in the eddies of a stream.
In time 
they would melt, partly or wholly, and so, on a small area, mingle 
their stony contents with those of other bergs moving down the 
fiord which also would be detained in the eddy.
Thus we get an 
explanation of the deposits occurring at one side of the valley ; for 
bergs entering the eddy would be carried round and detained in 
the still water near A, Fig. 14.
At that time, it must be remem- 
bered, bergs would be laden largely with sand and gravel, partly 
gathered up by the glaciers in their passage over the Middle Sands 
and Gravels, and partly by the icefoot from glacier streams.
The gravel mounds found on ridges such as that at Cockhow, 
may have been formed by the stranding of bergs carried into such 
positions by sea-currents, as these mounds generally occur in 
places where it is likely that currents would exist at a certain stage 
of submergence.
Take for instance the Cockhow deposit.
It lies 
exactly on the lowest part of the ridge separating Ennerdale from the 
head of UUdale, down which valley a current wOuld be likely to set 
after the ridges referred to had become covered with water.
One 
point in connection with this deposit is curious, and that is the 
existence in it of boulders of St. Bees Sandstone.
The altitude 
of the deposit is about two hundred feet higher than St. Bees.
Sandstone has been found in place in the district.
This curious 
fact may have arisen in this way.
It is known that large pieces of 
ice separate from the upper part of icebergs, carrying with them 
into the water their cargo of stones ; but it is not known that 
similar pieces of ice separate from the lower part of icebergs, for 
the simple reason that such a thing cannot be very well observed.
But it seems much more likely that masses of ice should be 
detached from the lower part of icebergs than from their upper 
part.
If so detached, they would at once rise to the surface, 
bringing with them their imbedded stones, which, as the ice melts, 
would be dropped on to the bottom of the sea.
Pieces of ice thus 
separating from bergs several hundred feet thick, might bring to 
the surface stones that had been torn from a glacier bed some 
hundreds of feet below the surface of the sea ; and these stones 
78 
might be deposited at a point where the sea was only a few fathoms 
deep.
In this way a simple explanation is afforded of a fact which 
has hitherto been a source of trouble to glacialists.
Origin of Moraitus and Moraine-like Mounds.
The true 
moraines probably originated in the same way as such like deposits 
are forming now in Switzerland ; but the conical hillocks clustered 
in the upper end of some of the higher valleys seem to have been 
deposited in water, and probably were formed at a time when 
these valleys — once fiords — were converted into straits by union 
with other valleys having the same direction, but falling the 
opposite way.
If it be assumed that a current then set up the 
valleys in which the deposits occur, we have all the conditions 
necessary for the formation of the moraine-like mounds.
Laden 
bergs carried along the strait would doubtless congregate over 
what is now the upper end of the valleys, either on account of the 
shallowness of the water over the ridge, or because of the narrow- 
ness of the strait at that point preventing the free onward move- 
ment of the bergs.
While thus detained, they would deposit part 
of their rocky burthen at the upper end of the valley out of which 
they were passing, and so give rise to the moraine-like mounds 
under consideration.
Generally.
For the purpose of shortening this communication 
as much as possible, I have specially avoided entering into argu- 
ments to shew the inadequacy of previous explanations, but have 
confined myself entirely to the task of framing another more 
agreeable to the facts of observation.

ON THE DISTINCTIVE COLOURS OF 
THE CARBONIFEROUS AND PERMIAN OR TRIASSIC 
(POIKILITIC) ROCKS OF NORTH CUMBERLAND.
By T.
V. HOLMES, F.G.S.
(Read at the Carlisle Annual Meeting.) 
My object in this paper is not to discuss the chemical differences 
in the colouring-matters tinting the Carboniferous and Permian 
rocks, but to show the importance of these variations of colour as 
guides to the geological classification of the rocks of North Cum- 
berland.
For the sections in these formations are often so few 
and far-between that, but for the reliance to be placed on the 
colour-test, the mapping of their boundary lines would be occasion- 
ally almost impossible.
On the other hand, the remarks I have to 
make will also demonstrate the fact that colour is an attribute 
that may lead the geologist very far astray, if unchecked by evidence 
of a more fundamental character.
In short, the importance of 
colour, in any case in which it affords the sole available evidence, 
depends upon the extent to which it has been found a true guide 
where there has been additional evidence sufficient to settle the 
question without its aid.
And the colour-test that might be 
sufficient in itself where there is much rock exposed to view, 
might be almost worthless where but two or three square feet are 
seen.
The usual, and most characteristic, colours of Carboniferous 
sandstones are various shades of brown or buff, varying from a 
deep brown to an almost pure white.
The shales interbedded 
80 
with them may be Hght- or dark-brown, light- or dark slate -coloured, 
or black.
These colours thus contrast decidedly with the wholly 
or mainly red tints of the overlying Permian and Triassic (or 
Poikilitic) sandstones and shales.
But exceptions occur.
In the 
Yorkshire Coalfield a massive sandstone, known as the "Red Rock 
of Rotherham," and some other rocks towards the Permian, or 
eastern, boundary of the coalfield, are so much redder in tint than 
is usual in Carboniferous beds, that they were formerly classed 
with the overlying Permians.
But the evidence collected during 
the Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coalfield showed that the 
Red Rock, though it lies unconformably on the Carboniferous 
rocks below, is also unconformable to the Permian Rocks above.
For in a railway cutting a little S.W. of Rotherham, Coal Measure 
rocks of ordinary appearance are seen overlying the Red Rock.
A very similar state of things is found in Cumberland, where 
the "Whitehaven Sandstone" takes the place occupied by the 
Red Rock of Rotherham in Yorkshire.
And, like the Red Rock, 
the Whitehaven Sandstone was, till quite lately, considered to be 
either Permian or Triassic, instead of Carboniferous.
For at 
Whitehaven, where it is best shown, it rests unconformably on 
Coal Measures of ordinary hue, and differs from them in its redder 
tint.
But the classification of the Carboniferous Whitehaven 
Sandstone as Permian or Triassic has led to errors of more 
importance than the Red Rock has occasioned in Yorkshire.
For, near Rotherham, the Red Rock and the other reddish beds 
invariably belong to the upper part of the Coal Measures, and no 
important practical error could arise from supposing them to be 
Permian.
But in Cumberland the red or reddish Carboniferous 
rocks are of very various ages ; from Upper Coal Measure (for 
instance) about Bullgill and elsewhere in the west, to Millstone 
Grit or Yoredale age in the Caldew on the east.
In both counties 
there are both conformable and unconformable red-stained Car- 
boniferous rocks.
But the unconformity between the Carboniferou s 
and Permian formations is much greater in the district, for example* 
south of Wigton, than in that east of Rotherham.
Two simple 
diagrams will illustrate better than many words could do, the

comparative effects of a slight and of a very decided unconformity 
along lines of the same length.
The first figure may be supposed 
to show (diagrammatically) the relations of the Permian and 
Carboniferous rocks east of Rotherham.
The second, their 
relations south of Wigton.
Now, it is obvious that everywhere near Rotherham Upper 
Coal Measures form the surface, and that a boring there would 
reach the more productive Middle Coal Measures sooner or later ; 
while in Cumberland it might, though equally near the Permian 
boundary, be entirely through Lower Carboniferous rocks.
And 
as the coal seams of the Lower Carboniferous rocks are very 
inferior both in number and thickness to those of the Coal- 
Measures proper, and are, indeed, seldom worth working, it is 
evident that to ascertain the true geological horizon of the 
red-stained rocks is a matter of very considerable practical 
importance.
But as no distinction of colour invariably separates 
Coal-Measures from Lower Carboniferous rocks, the horizon to 
which red-stained Carboniferous beds belong, in any given locality, 
can only be made out after long and careful study of the whole 
district.
On the other hand, the colour-test distinguishing Car- 
boniferous from Permian rocks has never hitherto been found to 
fail.
But as the older geological writers on the district missed the 
true significance of the various colours, I will first give some 
account of the older views, which are set forth in the valuable 
paper by the late Mr. Matthias Dunn on the Coalfields of Cum- 
berland, which was written more than twenty years ago.* 
When Dunn wrote, the evident unconformity of the Whitehaven 
Sandstone to the ordinary Coal-Measures (at Whitehaven) had 
caused it to be classed as Permian, or, as he prefers to term it, 
"New Red Sandstone." In the neighbourhood of Rose Gill 
Colliery (S.W. of Bullgill Railway Station), the Whitehaven Sand- 
stone is shown in many quarries, and is called by Dunn the 
"Lower Red Sandstone." He notices the difference of colour 
between the " Lower" and " Upper" Sandstones, and writes : — 
" The formation of the New Red Sandstone is comprised in two

82 
distinct characteristics, viz., the upper and lower, of indefinite 
thickness, but very frequently divided by a formation of magnesian 
limestone.
The upper division is remarkable for its redness, 
whereas the lower part is pale and closely approximates in colour 
to the ordinary sandstones of the acknowledged coal formation.
'j 
I would prefer saying, myself, that while the Permian (or New Red 
Sandstone) colour is brick-red, the stained Carboniferous rocks 
never quite attain that tint, but are pinkish or purple-grey, especially 
the latter, which is their most characteristic hue.
And rocks of 
ordinary Carboniferous brown are often found in close connexion 
with the more brightly coloured beds.
As localities at which stained Carboniferous rocks may be seen, 
it will suffice to mention the River Waver, about Bolton Low 
Houses, and the tributary which joins it near Pasture House ; 
Shalk Beck, south of the road connecting Near Welt on and Rosley 
Rigg ; and the Caldew, between the Permian stone under Rose 
Castle Bridge and Sebergham.
A sketch-map of this district 
appended to Dunn's paper shows, accordingly.
Westward, Rosley, 
and Sebergham all standing on the " New Red Sandstone." And 
Dunn's map resembles in all essential points the older editions of 
the geological maps of Ramsay and Greenough, and even the 
geological map of Cumberland in Mr. Jenkinson's excellent 
Handbook to the Lakes, 5th Ed., 1876.
The differences in the 
above maps refer mainly to the boundary lines between Permian 
and New Red Sandstone, not Permian and Carboniferous rocks.
I have now to prove my case that the " Lower Red Sandstone" 
of Dunn is not Permian or New Red Sandstone, but Carboniferous.
To do this it is necessary to ascend the stream known as Chalk, 
Shawk, or Shalk Beck for less than two miles above East Curthwaite.
Starting from that place, we speedily enter a gorge, the sides of 
which are composed of brick-red sandstone, capped by glacial 
drift.
This is the Permian sandstone, known to geologists as the 
St. Bees Sandstone, as it is identical with the rock which forms the 
promontory of St. Bees Head.
The dip being northerly, we find 
the stream cutting through lower and lower beds as we advance 
southward.
The stone is much quarried here, as it is between 
««i 
CM 
O 
^ 
83 
Aspatria and West Newton, Though mainly red, rock of a 
yellowish-buff colour is occasionally seen, the best example being 
at "Tom Smith's Leap." South of this point the stone gradually 
becomes flaggy and shaly, and more and more unfit for building.
Some small faults are beautifully shown in the left, or western, bank 
a Httle beyond a small hut, and just below the sharp easterly bend 
made by the stream towards Chalk Cottage.
At the most easterly 
point of this bend, above the "old course of the stream," a little 
Carboniferous Limestone is visible in the high bank, below the 
glacial drift.
This limestone has been formerly burnt for lime, as 
the adjacent limekiln testifies.
On the east side of the road 
leading to Chalk Cottage, and beside the kiln, the breccia at the 
base of the St. Bees sandstone may be seen, together with a fault 
which is probably the result of the union of the smaller ones lower 
down.
Ascending the stream, the Permian beds are still visible in 
its bed and banks for a few yards more ; buton crossing a small 
alluvial flat on its eastern side, and reaching a spot at which, as 
we proceed, we find the beck turning sharply westward, the un- 
conformity at the junction between the brick-red Permian beds 
and certain purple-grey and pinkish rocks on which they rest, 
becomes manifest in the high eastern bank.
The footpath now 
begins to ascend the western bank, and the unconformity between 
the purple-grey (or Carboniferous) and the brick-red (or Permian) 
beds is again visible close to the path, as the base of the Permians 
rises southward higher and higher above the beck.
In the bed of 
the stream purple-grey and light-coloured Carboniferous rocks 
appear.
They have an easterly dip instead of a northerly one ; and, 
altogether, nothing can be clearer than the unconformity between 
the two formations and the marked change of colour accom- 
panying it.
But before the road from Rosley Rigg to Near Welton 
is reached, a fault crossing the stream, with a direction nearly east 
and west and a downthrow to the south, brings in the Permian 
rocks again, so that the whole of the field north of the road and west 
of the beck is covered with fragments of St. Bees Sandstone from 
the water's edge upwards.
A small quarry in the higher part of 
this field shows that the Permian beds brought in again by this 
84 
fault are the flaggy ones towards the base of the St. Bees Sandstone.
A very pretty surface contortion may be seen in this quarry.
The 
breadth, from north to south, of this faulted piece of Permian 
ground is slightly greater than that of this field.
Crossing the 
road, and continuing to ascend the stream, Carboniferous rocks 
may be seen here and there for more than four miles ; and, for the 
most part, they are purple-grey or pinkish in colour.
But it would 
be almost, if not quite, impossible for the most careful observer to 
pick out even a hand-specimen from these stained Carboniferous 
rocks that would pass as an example of Permian stone ; the brick- 
red tint being precisely the shade that is not to be found.
From this district I will now turn to one about an equal distance 
from the Border City, but in the opposite direction, and review 
the evidence afforded by the streams flowing into the Solway from 
the north-east, beginning with the Esk. From the Scotch Dyke 
railway bridge northward, St. Bees Sandstone is visible for about 
three-quarters of a mile.
The church at Canobie stands on stained 
Carboniferous rock, above which, on the opposite cHff, is an outlier 
of what I have termed, in my paper on the Carlisle Basin, read 
before the Geological Society last year — the Kirklinton Sandstone, 
and consider to be of later date than that of St. Bees.
But the 
junction between the two formations is not visible.
In the Liddel 
also it is not apparent, but it must be a few yards below the Lang- 
holm Branch railway bridge, at, and above which, are stained 
Carboniferous beds.
In Carwinley Burn the junction is about 
one-third of a mile above the point at which the road from Long- 
town to Penton Bridge crosses the stream.
The banks at the 
junction are low, but the bed of the stream shows brick -red flaggy 
beds, having a breccia at their base, resting on purple-grey and 
other rocks which are dipping at a much higher angle.
This 
marked difference of dip, combined with the presence of the breccia 
at the base of the brick -red beds, affords ample evidence of an 
unconformity on the same horizon as that in Shalk Beck, though 
the additional proof given in the high banks of that stream is here 
wanting.
Crossing to the River Lyne at Cliff Bridge, Kirklinton, we there 
85 
find the Kirklinton Sandstone.
Ascending the stream, the same 
rock is seen about as far up as Shield Green, being especially well 
displayed where the grounds of Kirklinton Hall come down to the 
river.
Between Shield Green and Brackenhill Tower, the under- 
lying St. Bees Sandstone forms the bed and banks of the Lyne.
But, close to Brackenhill Tower, a fault, having a nearly north and 
south direction, and westerly downthrow, is seen crossing the 
river-bed, and eastward of it the brick-red rocks disappear, and 
their place is taken by variously tinted beds of the Carboniferous 
series.
A massive sandstone, which, about a mile above Bracken- 
hill Tower, forms the " Fairy Tables," suggests, at first sight, either 
that Permian rock is again appearing, or that we have an exception 
to the rule as to colour.
But here, as elsewhere, stained Carbon- 
iferous rocks which do not at a first glance show their true affinities 
beyond a doubt do so on breaking off a good-sized fragment.
Then, beneath the perhaps uniformly almost brick-red exterior, 
purple-grey, or some other tint, is shown to be the colour of the 
mass.
This rock of the "Fairy Tables," however, deserves especial 
mention, not only on account of its goodness as an example of 
stained Carboniferous rock, but because there is no river in 
Cumberland whose beauties as well as geological sections so well 
deserve a visit, and yet are so little known, as those of the Lyne 
about Kirkhnton.* 
Lastly, the Hether Burn, a small stream which falls into the 
Lyne at Cliff Bridge, shows the unconformity between brick-red 
and purple-grey as well as, or better than, Shawk Beck itself.
But 
this unconformity is about six miles from the nearest railway station, 
and in a very thinly populated and little visited neighbourhood, 
that of Hethersgill.
If we ascend the Hether Burn from its outfall, 
we pass from the bright red Kirklinton Sandstone to the duller- 
tinted Sandstone of St. Bees at Hether Bank Bridge, above which 
are quarries.
Above Howford Bridge the rock is of the flaggy char- 
acter shown towards the base of the St. Bees Sandstone in Shalk 
* Even the late Professor Harkness, whose knowledge of Cumberland rocks 
was singularly extensive, paid his first visit to Kirklinton in the summer of 1876.
He was mu=h surprised at the beauty and geological interest of the Lyne there.
86 
Beck and Carwinley Burn.
A farm called Grainhead stands on the 
north side of the Burn, above Prior Rigg and Hethergrove,and below 
Fieldhead.
The unconformity may be seen in the stream where 
it bounds the field south-east of the Grainhead farm buildings, and 
is a little above the bridge.
There is breccia at the Permian base, 
and the brick-red beds are seen to rest on Carboniferous rocks of 
various colours, which dip at a much higher angle.
In this, which may be called the Border district, misapprehension 
as to the true affinities of the various red or reddish-tinted rocks 
has led, as in the Wigton district, to an undue enlargement of the 
Permian boundary.
This may be seen on comparing the map 
attached to Mr. Gibsone's paper on the Border districts of Cum- 
berland* with the remarks I have made as to the real amount of 
Permian ground on the Esk and Liddel.
Thus : in Mr. Gibsone's 
map the Permian boundary line crosses the Esk about three-quarters 
of a mile north of Canobie church.
But, as I have already 
remarked, the church stands on Carboniferous rock, the boundary 
crossing the river at least half a mile south of the church.
Again, 
on the Liddel, Mr. Gibsone places the boundary line a mile and a 
half, or thereabouts, higher up the stream than the presence of 
brick-red rocks would justify him in doing.
But in the Wigton 
district so much larger is the amount of territory improperly 
annexed to the Permian formation than on the Border, that the 
importance of the true colour-test near Wigton is worth showing 
by means of a sketch map illustrating the older and the newer 
views.
For this purpose I give the boundaries of the Carboniferous 
and Permian rocks south of Wigton, as they appear in the sketch 
map appended to Matthias Dunn's paper, and also as they are 
drawn in that illustrating my paper on the Carlisle Basin, already 
referred to.
I trust, in conclusion, that sufficient evidence has been given to 
prove my case that brick-red is the characteristic Permian red, and 
that purple-grey and pinkish rocks, being invariably found to be 
Carboniferous where there is plenty of evidence besides that of 
colour, may fairly be presumed to be Carboniferous where colour 
* North Eng. Inst.
Min. Eng., vol.
xi.
87 
affords the only available evidence.
We have seen, however, 
that buff, besides being a characteristic Carboniferous colour, is 
occasionally Permian.
But in the St. Bees Sandstone the buff 
stone is in very small quantity compared with the red, and although 
the upper beds of the Kirklinton Sandstone at and west of Carlisle 
are mainly light grey or whitish, that rock does not in our district 
directly overlie Carboniferous beds, except in the cliff opposite 
Canobie church, and there it is brick-red.
Whether we have to 
deal with the St. Bees- or the Kirklinton Sandstone, the red is 
always brick-red, and not pinkish or purple-grey.
The colour- 
distinction thus holds good between the whole of the Carboniferous 
rocks on the one hand, and all the overlying red or mainly red 
rocks — call them Permian and Triassic or Poikilitic,* as you will 
— on the other.
My colleagues of the Geological Survey could bring forward 
precisely similar evidence, as to the distinctive colours of these 
rocks, from their own districts.
But my object here is simply to 
record what I have seen myself, in the hope that it may prove 
useful to local observers, and prevent either a waste of time in 
searching for evidence where none exists, or its neglect where it 
abounds.
* It is probable that the whole of these red rocks will shortly be united 
together under some comprehensive name such as Poiklitic, a term proposed 
originally by Conybeare.

CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS 
A LIST OF THE FUNGI GROWING IN THE 
DISTRICT AROUND CARLISLE.
By Dr. CARLYLE.
(Communicated at the Carlisle Anntial Meeting.) 
The following contribution towards a list of the Fungi growing 
within a radius of five miles around Carlisle has been drawn up at 
the request of the Committee, from the substance of some lectures 
delivered before the Carlisle Scientific Society in 1881 and 1882.
It contains the results of a systematic study of these organisms 
dating only from the early part of 1881, and it is therefore 
necessarily incomplete in its present form ; and it will, doubtless, 
require to be considerably extended as further observations are 
made.
Such forms as require for their identification a minute 
examination by the aid of the microscope are not referred to in 
the present list.

CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A LIST 
OF THE MINERALS OCCURRING IN CUMBERLAND 
AND WESTMORLAND.
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, of the Geological Survey of England.
(Communuated at the Carlisle Aftntial Meeting.) 
The following list of Minerals occurring in Cumberland and 
Westmorland has been drawn up chiefly from notes collected by 
myself during a stay of several years in Edenside.
To these notes 
a careful examination of the fine series of Cumberland and West- 
morland Minerals collected by the late Professor Harkness, F.R.S., 
arid now belonging to Mrs. Pearson of Penrith, has enabled me to 
add several others, especially of the rarer minerals from the Cald- 
beck Fells.
The Collections in the British Museum, the Museum of 
Practical Geology, the Carlisle Museum, and elsewhere, have 
added further to the list.
I have also consulted Townshend Hall's 
Mineralogisfs Directory, Greg and Lettsom's British Mitieralogy, 
Ward's Geology of the Northern Fart of the Lake District, Bristow's 
Glossary of Mineralogy, Rutley's Text Book of Mineralogy (the 
cheapest good book on Mineralogy we have), and lastly, Mr.
Postlethwaite's Essay on Mines and Mining i?i the Lake District.
My colleagues, Messrs.
Rudler and Meade, and Mr. Bauerman, 
have also helped me with information that I have embodied in 
these notes.
The list is not put forward as an exhaustive one, in regard to 
either the species of minerals, or their characteristics, or their mode 
and place of occurrence ; and I may add that I shall be very glad 
102 
to have any further information regarding Cumberland and West- 
morland Minerals that will help to make the list complete ; and 
that the source of any information so received shall be acknow- 
ledged in due course.
The Classification adopted here is that employed in the arrange- 
ment of the admirable collection in the British Museum ; as, all 
things considered, this system is by far the best that has yet been 
devised.
According to this the minerals are primarily arranged in four 
Divisions : — 
I. The Native Elements.
II.
The Compounds of the Metals with Elements of the 
Arsenic Group, or of the Sulphur Group, or with 
Elements belonging to both those groups.
III.
The Compounds of the Metals with the Chlorine Group.
IV.
The Compounds of the Elements with Oxygen.
Each of these divisions is again divided into sections containing 
minerals chemically related to one another ; and the sections are 
further subdivided into groups arranged according to the crystallo- 
graphic forms assumed by the several minerals composing it.
The first Division, or that of the elements found native in an 
uncombined state, generally embraces a very small number of 
mineral species ; and in the district referred to in this list it may 
well be doubted whether more than three or four species may be 
safely included.
The first of these is Gold.
This metal is said to have been obtained in small quantities at 
Goldscope and Brandley Mines, on the south-west side of Derwent- 
water ; but whether part of the metal so obtained occurred in the 
form of specks and isolated grains sparingly disseminated through 
the vein stuff, or whether all of it occurred in intimate association 
with the Chalcopyrites and Pyrites found in those mines, does not 
seem to have been recorded.
Traces of Gold may, it is said, 
usually be detected in nearly every carefully-conducted analysis of 
the two ores just mentioned ; but there seems to be some doubt 
103 
whether the mineral occurs in the metallic condition under these 
circumstances, or whether it may not exist in combination with the 
associated ores in the form of an hypothetical sulphide.
At any 
rate, the percentage of gold obtainable from any given quantity of 
ore is usually so small that, in the majority of cases, it might 
almost as well be left unmenlioned.
In regard to the second species, Silver, the same kind of 
difficulty exists.
Silver, in the form of Native Silver, has never 
yet been found in our district, so far as I can learn, except in 
intimate association with other ores.
Considerable quantities of Silver are, as is well known, 
extracted by Pattinson's and other processes from the Galena 
raised in the two Counties.
In 1873 the Greenside Mines alone 
yielded 16,000 ounces of silver from 942 tons of lead, which is in 
the proportion of about seventeen ounces to the ton.
Smaller 
quantities have been found to exist in other ores, especially in 
Fahlerz ; but it is not known for certain whether this silver occurs 
in the metallic, or uncombined state, or whether it exists, as it is 
considered to do by many competent authorities, in the form of 
the sulphide, Argentite, which is ismorphous with Galena.
Native Lead, one hears of now and then as having been found 
in one or other of the mines around us ; but any well-authenticated 
instance of its occurrence under circumstances that leave no doubt 
that its metallic condition is due to the action of purely natural 
causes does not seem yet to have been brought forward.
The occurrence of one metal, at all events, seems beyond a 
doubt.
The world-renowned mines of the Caldbeck Fells, Brandy 
Gill especially, have now and then yielded indubitable specimens 
of Native Bismuth.
Native Bismuth crystaUizes in the hexagonal system ; but the 
crystallographic form of minerals obtained from the quartz-vein 
stuff of the Brandy Gill Mines is not always very apparent.
The 
general aspect of our mineral is that of laminar masses of thin 
plates, which have a bright silvery lustre, and, on the freshly-fractured 
surface, a tint between that of silver and of copper, which gives 
104 
place to an iridescent tarnish after the mineral has been exposed to 
the air for any length of time.
Besides the cleavage parallel to the 
general lamination of the mineral, two sets of subordinate cleavage 
planes cut it in directions perpendicular to the first, and intersect 
each other in such a manner as to cut the laminae into rhombs.
This is an important source of the Bismuth of commerce, but 
with us it occurs only in very small quantities, and is then usually 
associated with Telluric Bismuth, Bismuthine, Bismuth Ochre, 
Wolfram, Scheelite, and other interesting mineral species.
The last element on the list is Graphite, Plumbago, or Black 
Lead.
This was formerly be considered as more or less of a Car- 
buret of Iron ; but it is now usual to regard the Iron, or the other 
matter associated with the Graphite as adventitious, and to class 
Graphite as one of the two allotropic mineral forms of Carbon.
The mode of occurrence and the method of working the Plumbago 
found in the renowned mines of Borrowdale have been so fully 
described by my colleague, the late Mr. Ward, in the Geological 
Survey Memoir on the Northern Part of the Lake District ; and 
again by Mr. Postlethwaite of Keswick in his essay on " Mines 
and Mining in the Lake District," that it would be out of place for 
me to repeat the substance of their remarks here.
Plumbago is 
said to occur at Bannerdale Mine on Saddleback, as well as in the 
better-known locality of Borrowdale.
IL 
The next division comprises the compounds of the Metallic 
Elements (i) with the Elements of the Arsenic Group — the 
Arsenoids, viz., Bismuth, Antimony, and Arsenic; (it.) with the 
Elements of the Sulphur Group — the Thionids, viz., Tellurium, 
Selenium, and Sulphur; and, (m.) with the Elements of both the 
Arsenic and the Sulphur groups.
(/.) Amongst the minerals recorded by Mr. Ward as occurring 
in the Lake District mention is made of Nickel, which is stated 
to have occurred in the form of specks in a quartz-vein in High 
Snab Bank, north of Robinson.
Nickel has not yet been known 
105 
to occur native in the metallic state ; and it is more likely that the 
ore in question occurred in the form of Kupfernickel, Copper 
Nickel, Nickeline, or Nickel Arsenide.
Further information, on 
this point is very desirable.
Smaltine, Cobalt Diarsenide, has been recorded from Force 
Crag Mine, Keswick, where it was associated with Manganite, 
Tourmaline, Stoltzite, and several other minerals of interest.
Mr.
Ward makes mention of Cobalt as occurring in small specks in a 
quartz-vein between Sail Crag and Scar Crag, west of Derwent- 
water ; but I have not yet been able to discover whether the 
particular form of Cobalt ore referred to by Mr. Ward belongs to 
this species or not.
(ii.) The next subdivision, or compounds of the Metals with 
the Thionids, includes some species of considerable importance.
Argentite, or Silver Sulphide.
Assuming that the view is 
correct that the silver obtained from our argentiferous galena 
occurs in the form of Argentite, which is isomorphous with Galena, 
its proper place in the list should be here.
But as the presence of 
silver in this form is only inferred from analogy, no description of 
our specimen is possible.
Some idea of the importance of this mineral production may 
be gathered from the fact that in the year 1880, when our mines 
were not much worked, no less than 24,998 ounces of silver were 
raised in Cumberland and Westmorland alone.
Copper Glance, Redruthite, or Copper Sulphide, is mentioned 
by Townshend Hall {op.
cit.) as occurring in Cumberland ; but 
the precise locality, mode of occurrence, and local form are not 
mentioned.
I have not seen a specimen of this mineral from our 
district myself.
Some time last year a notice went the round of our local news- 
papers to the effect that Cinnabar, or Mercury Sulphide, had 
been discovered somewhere or other out Caldbeck Fells way.
There is, of course, no valid reason why this important orQ of 
106 
Mercury should not occur where it was said to have been found ; 
but hitherto no ore of Mercury has been detected within the limits 
of the British Isles ; and then again, one has heard so often of 
such things being dropped by accident or otherwise in places 
much frequented by people interested in mining matters, that until 
the existence of the ore in situ has been actually demonstrated to 
the satisfaction of mineralogists.
Cinnabar cannot be included in 
the list of minerals occurring in Cumberland and Westmorland.
The case is far different with the next mineral on the list — 
Blende, Black Jack, or Zinc Sulphide.
This is one of the most 
widely-distributed ores, and at the same time one of the most 
easily-recognised of the minerals occurring in our district.
It is 
found principally, perhaps exclusively, in fault-fissures, or in the 
adjoining rock ; generally in association with the lead-veins and 
the copper-veins occurring throughout the two Counties.
Blende is sometimes mistaken for Cassiterite, or Tin Oxide ; but 
Blende may be known at once by yielding to the knife more easily 
than the ore of tin does, as well as by its presenting a much more 
even fracture.
Blende crystallises in the Cubic System, and its 
crystals are in great request among spar-hunters on account of their 
beautiful lustre.
Beautiful examples of Blende, coated with pearly 
crystals of Dolomite, from Keswick, and others from the Alston 
district, adorn the National Collection; while other equally-fine 
specimens from our district may usually be found in most collections 
of minerals.
991 tons, 8 cwt.
of Zinc, having a money value of 
;^36i2 IS.
od.
were raised from the Cumberland mines in 1880; 
but part of this may have been obtained from the Zinc Carbonate, 
or Calamine.
Great quantities of Blende will remain unutilised in the dead- 
heaps of our mines until Metallurgists shall teach us some 
more economical method of reducing this ore to the metallic 
form.
Traces of Cadmium Sulphide usually occur in association with 
Blende in the same way as Argentite is associated with Galena, 
and Gold with Chalcopyrites ; but its actual existence in the 
107 
Blendes of Cumberland and Westmorland in the form of the 
particular species Greenockite, has been questioned by competent 
authorities.
Galena, Blue Ore, or Lead Sulphide, is the mineral species 
ranking next in economic importance to the Coal and the 
Haematite raised in Cumberland and Westmorland.
The greater 
part of the lead employed in the arts is derived from this 
ore ; and the mines of Cumberland and Westmorland contribute 
very largely to the total quantity raised in the United Kingdom.
In the year ended with the close of 1880— an exceptionally bad 
time for lead-mines and miners generally, no less than 3781 tons 
of lead ore, having a money value of ^38,658 7^.
10^., were 
raised in Cumberland and Westmorland; and in former years, 
when trade was good, and mining enterprise in the ascendant, the 
tonnage raised per annum was considerably in excess of this.
As 
It would be unfair to select any individual mine for special mention, 
it is better to refer to Mr. Robert Hunt's « Mineral Statistics," 
compiled at the Mining Record Office for further information on 
this head.
Galena usually occurs in connection with some of the vertical 
lines of dislocation, or faults, that traverse all our older rocks ; 
where it is found irregularly disseminated through the fault-breccia, 
or ramifying thence into the contiguous strata, in interrupted strips, 
nests, bunches, strings, or pockets, each generally consisting of aggre- 
gations of galena crystals associated more or less with other minerals 
of less importance in a commercial aspect.
The greatest extension 
of the mineral deposit is nearly always in the direction of the 
length of the vein, while its extension downward may not exceed a 
few hundred feet, and its width may vary from a few feet down to 
a mere fraction of an inch.
Only too often it is found to terminate 
abruptly, even within a short distance of an extensive deposit.
Not unfrequently, especially where the vein traverses limestone, or 
other rocks that yield readily to chemical erosion, the ore extends 
into the chambers and cavities formed by the partial removal of 
the rock adjoming the vein, and these cavities are often lined, or 
even entirely filled, by masses of crystals of galena.
108 
Less frequently what are called flots {notjlats) or irregularly 
ramifying strings and sheets of ore, traverse the rock adjoining the 
vein in planes ranging within a few degrees of the perpendicular to 
the plane of the fault, in such a manner as occasionally to give rise 
to a kind of stratified appearance.
Our galena is generally met with in the form of the cube ; but 
other forms belonging to the Cubic System are far from uncommon, 
and beautiful examples of octahedral crystals, many of them of 
large size, have been met with at Dufton, Helton, Murton, and 
elsewhere.
Galena occurs here and there through all the great upland tract 
of Carboniferous rocks that extends away to the east and the 
north-east from the Pennine Faults.
It is worthy of remark that 
hardly a trace of any lead ore has yet been detected in the portion 
of the self-same Carboniferous rocks that occupies the low ground 
of Edenside on the skirts of the Lake District, notwithstanding 
that the beds of rock are, above a certain horizon, identifiable bed 
for bed, and are in almost perfect agreement even in minute 
particulars with the rocks wherein most of the ore has been 
obtained in the more elevated tracts.
Yet these same Carbon- 
iferous rocks on the outskirts of the Lake District are traversed by 
faults and smaller fractures in exactly the same way as are the 
ore-yielding beds just mentioned.
This would seem to prove that 
the ore has not always been derived from the rock adjoining the 
veins, if it has been so derived anywhere else.
Here and there 
the older rocks that compose the Lake District have yielded 
galena ; but, although it is true that, in individual mines, very large 
quantities of ore have been derived from veins traversing these 
older rocks, the metalliferous veins occur in a more sporadic and 
disconnected way, and the yield of ore is even more uncertain than 
it is in the metalliferous part of the district occupied by rocks of 
the Carboniferous Limestone series.
In regard to the origin of the ore occurring in our district, a 
series of observations extending over a mining area of several 
hundred square miles, has led me to conclude that our ore dates 
from comparatively recent times, geologically speaking ; and that 
109 
in all probability it originated during the last upheaval of the 
district, when the volcanic forces that had produced so important 
effects in Miocene times were gradually expending themselves in 
the formation of hot and mineral springs.
These forced their way 
upwards along the old lines of weakness and deposited the minerals 
held in solution as soon as the temperature of the upflowing current 
was reduced to the depositing point by contact with colder 
currents flowing downwards from the surface or by actual proximity 
to the surface itself I have also been led to conclude that the 
lead ore, at the close of the period of its formation, extended 
through the rocks of our district as shallow, detached vein deposits, 
whose general contour, if the disconnected deposits could be joined 
over large areas, would be that of irregularly concavo-convex sheets 
or inverted saucer-shaped masses.
The way the ore works down- 
wards as we recede from particular centres seems to point to these 
centres marking approximately the position of the principal seats 
of hydrothermal action ; as, where the temperature of the thermal 
springs rose highest it would be there that the mineral matters 
would rise to the parts nearest to the surface before the temperature 
of the medium was reduced to the depositing point.
Of course, 
where the form of the surface, or the lie of the rocks, favoured the 
accumulation of larger quantities than usual of water derived from 
the surface, this cause would act in an opposite direction, and 
induce deposition at a lower horizon than would otherwise be the 
case.
Variations in the thermal conductivity of the adjoining 
rocks would also produce important modifications of the same 
kind of effect.
It is causes of this nature that have led, I believe, 
to the ore in one part of a district occurring only in rocks high up 
near the tops of the fells, and in another in a part of the same 
series lower by many hundreds of feet ; and, again, to the ore 
occurring exclusively in connection with limestones in one area, 
while elsewhere it is found only in arenaceous beds.
The same 
causes will help to explain why the concurrence of a downfold of 
the rocks with a dislocation should have been favourable to 
mineral deposition, and in another, why it seems to have exercised 
no perceptible influence at all.
The whole body of facts seem to 
no 
point to the deposition of the ore having been the result of an 
extremely complex, and delicately-adjusted, series of causes 
variously combining to reduce the temperature of the mineral 
solutions that were rising through the deeper-seated fissures until 
the depositing point was reached.
This must have taken place 
during a period of a^-heaval, because the evidence often clearly 
shews that the walls of the vein were repeatedly stretched asunder 
during the formation of the mineral vein ; thereby shewing that the 
rocks were being subjected to lateral tension as the rocks adjusted 
themselves from a smaller horizontal extension to a larger during 
their last upheaval.
Another sulphide of some importance is Chalcopyrite, Copper 
Pyrites, or "Yellow Ore" — a double Sulphide of Copper and 
Iron.
The principal mines of Copper Pyrites in this district 
are in the neighbourhood of Keswick and of the Caldbeck 
Fells.
On the south side of the Lake District, there are 
the well known mines at Coniston, and here and there, chiefly 
amongst the Cambrian and the Silurian rocks of the Lake District 
isolated mines of more or less importance have been worked.
Copper in the same form has been wrought in the Carboniferous 
Limestone of the upper parts of Edenside at Clouds Mine, and in 
Mallerstang ; and again close to Harcla, near Kirkby Stephen ; 
and traces of the same ore occur about Helton, where the vein 
stuff consists of quartz.
The ore usually occurs in the form of interrupted strings and 
irregular masses varying greatly in form and size, and traversing 
the vein stuff, which is most commonly quartz, in much the same 
way that galena does.
Crystalline forms are not commonly met 
with.
The general aspect of the ore occurring with us is that of 
metallic-looking masses more or less of the colour of gold, but with 
a marked disposition to assume a tarnished surface.
Copper pyrites 
cannot be hammered out in the way that gold can, and it is further 
distinguished from the only other mineral that bears any superficial 
resemblance to it — Pyrites — by its inferior hardness.
The ore of 
copper can be cut with a knife, whereas Pyrites is sufficiently hard 
to strike fire with steel.
Ill 
In and around the Caldbeck Fells this ore has undergone a 
good deal of decomposition where it occurs near the surface, and 
its constituents have entered into numerous fresh combinations.
In 1880 no copper was returned as having been raised in Cumber- 
land and Westmorland, although in former years it was one of the 
most important ores of the district.
The well-known Iron Pyrites, Mundic, Sulphur Ore, or Iron 
Bisulphide, occurs in tolerable abundance in nearly all the mines 
throughout our district, whatever the ore may be that the veins are 
especially worked for.
Hence the mineral is tolerably familiar to 
nearly all.
Very beautiful cubical crystals of Pyrites occur in some 
of the mines near Keswick, and are in great request for ornamental 
purposes.
At one time some pyrites was systematically worked 
in the Alston district for the manufacture of Sulphuric Acid ; but 
the demand for this purpose is now more generally met by supplies 
from foreign sources, especially from Spain and Portugal.
But 
even yet five hundred tons, worth about ;^25o, were raised in 
Cumberland in 1880.
The general distribution of Iron Sulphide in veins may really be 
due to the circulation and the downward flow of water from the 
surface, which would have the effect of constantly removing the 
products of decomposition in solution and redepositing them 
at lower levels where suitable conditions for their reduction 
obtained.
Pyrites itself crystallizes in forms belonging to the Cubic System; 
but we have another species of the same compound, called Marca- 
siTE, or White Pyrites, that assumes crystalline forms belonging to 
the Rhombic System.
It is rather rare with us, and I have not been 
able to discover any locality for it besides that of the mines in the 
Alston district.
At Garrigill Mine it occurs crystallized upon 
Calcite, and there is a specimen of this mineral in the British 
Museum, from Snappergill Mines, which consists of an irregular 
aggregation of rhombic crystals with pointed ends, shaped some- 
thing like the knives of a mowing machine, and which has the 
entire surface of the mineral tarnished, as usual, to nearly black.
112 
Marcasite was at one time much used for making into ornaments, 
brooches and the like.
Molybdenite, Molybdenum Sulphide, is one of the rarer 
minerals found in our district.
It seems to occur most commonly 
in small scaly patches in the granite now so extensively worked 
at Shap ; and a visit to the quarry will generally enable almost 
anyone to secure more or less perfect specimens.
Less commonly 
it may be found in the same form, and occurring in the same way, 
in the quartz matrix of the veins traversing the Skidda Granite at 
Brandy Gill Mines, where it is associated with Wolfram, Scheelite, 
Mispickel, Telluric Bismuth, and a host of interesting mineral 
species.
It bears some resemblance to Graphite, but may be 
distinguished by its paler colour, its somewhat more decidedly 
metallic lustre, and its greener streak.
It also resembles Galena, 
but may be at once distinguished by its property of marking on 
paper.
Brandy Gill Mines yield occasional specimens of the beautiful 
mineral known as Telluric Bismuth, or Tetradymite.
This is 
described in the British Museum cases as " Bismuth with telluride, 
sulphide, and selenide of Bismuth." The specimens in the British 
Museum are said to be from Roughten Gill, but the character of the 
matrix associated with the specimen is exactly like that of the well- 
known quartz-with-muscovite matrix of Brandy Gill.
The mineral 
occurs in laminar masses with a foliated structure, and a very 
perfect cleavage.
The freshly-cleaved faces present a very beautiful 
bright silvery lustre.
Brandy Gill is the only known British 
locality, and the mineral is not by any means of common occur- 
rence there.
Professor Sedgwick refers to an Antimony mine in the Skidda 
Slate near the foot of Bassenthwaite ; but the precise locality and 
the exact species of the mineral are not mentioned.
Antimonite, Stibnite, or Antimony tersulphide, is given in Greg 
and Lettsom's British Mineralogy, and in Bristow's Glossary, as 
occurring at Robin Hood Mine, Bassenthwaite, which is probably 
the locality referred to by Sedgwick.
113 
A singular discovery of a lump of Stibnite in the Glacial drift 
near Troutbeck Station (Cockermouth, Keswick, and Penrith 
Railway), is mentioned in Ward's Geology of the Northern Part of 
the Lake District.
BisMUTHiNE, Bismuth Glance, or Bismuth tersulphide, is 
another ore of Bismuth found at Brandy Gill.
Our specimens 
have the aspect of dull, greasy-looking, lead-coloured scales, with 
somewhat more lustre than that of lead.
They occur chiefly in the 
quartz vein-stuff along with the minerals already enumerated from 
the same locality.
The British Museum specimens are almost 
certainly from the Brandy Gill locality.
MisPiCKEL, Iron Arseno-Sulphide, has already been mentioned 
as occurring along with Molybdenite at Brandy Gill.
It occurs as 
granular steely-looking masses in the interstices between the faces 
of the quartz crystals in the vein-stuff; and is generally remarkable 
for the pecuHar tarnish developed on the surface of the mineral 
after some exposure to the weather.
Much of the quartz around 
the Mispickel is often stained, or coated, with a ferruginous deposit, 
probably due to the partial decomposition of the ore.
Another ore of copper of considerable importance in some 
districts is Fahlerz, Fahlore, Grey Copper ore, Tetrahedrite, the 
Tetra-basic Sulph-Antimonide of Copper.
This occurs at only two localities that I am aware of, and these 
are in the veins traversing the disturbed mass of Mountain Lime- 
stone adjoining the Great Pennine Faults at Clouds, to the south 
of Kirkby Stephen; and, in smaller quantities, under the same 
circumstances to the east of Harcla, Kirkby Stephen.
The ore 
occurs in the form of irregular lumps of a grey colour, with a 
sub-metallic lustre on the freshly-fractured surface ; but exteriorly 
more or less tinged with an ochreous rust due to the oxidation of 
part of its iron.
The interior of each lump is frequently occupied 
by irregular cavities lined with the blue and the green carbonates 
of copper; while traces of Chalcopyrites maybe detected here 
and there in the solid parts of the ore.
It is associated with 
114 
Galena, Chalcopyrites, Fluor, Calcite, and Barytes in both 
localities.
III.
The Third Division comprises the compounds of the Metals 
with the Halogen elements — Iodine, Bromine, Chlorine, and 
Fluorine.
Of these only the two following species are represented 
here.
One of the best-known and most widely distributed minerals 
occurring in our district is Fluorite, Fluor spar, or Calcium 
Fluoride.
As a rule Fluor spar occurs chiefly in the lead veins 
traversing the Carboniferous rocks, and it does not occur in any great 
quantities in the non-calcareous rocks, even where the other minerals 
that usually accompany it are found in tolerable abundance.
In 
the lead-mining districts it occurs perhaps in nearly all the veins of 
one part, while in the veins of an adjoining area, traversing precisely 
the same rocks, and, to all appearance, produced under precisely 
similar conditions, it is frequently conspicuous by its absence.
Its 
vertical distribution also seems to be equally irregular ; and the 
vein-stuff that in one part of a lode contains this mineral in 
abundance may be totally devoid of it a hundred feet or so lower 
down.
Like the Galena it is so frequently associated with, Fluor 
does not often occur, perhaps it hardly ever occurs, except in the 
rock in connection with a fault.
Our Fluor usually occurs in the 
form of cubes, and its colour varies so much that, beyond the 
statement that its commonest tint is that of the amethyst, no 
general description can be given.
In the mines around Cross 
Fell beautiful examples of the dichroic variety of Fluor spar 
occur.
These appear of different colours, according as they are 
viewed by reflected or by transmitted light.
The most beautiful 
specimens of Fluor obtained in Cumberland generally come from 
the mines of the Alston district, which has furnished examples of 
this species to nearly all the leading collections in the kingdom.
Halite, Common Salt,or Sodium Chloride, may justly be claimed 
as a Cumberland and Westmorland mineral for more than one 
115 
reason ; the principal reason that I would give being that of the 
discovery by Professor Harkness of the characteristic hopper-shaped 
pseudomorphs of the crystals of this mineral in the New Red 
Rocks of the Eden Valley.
Doubtless, when the Stanwix Marls 
come to be thoroughly explored we may succeed in meeting with 
existing crystals of the salt itself; if it should not be proved to 
occur in the more commercially-important form of regular beds.
The origin of Rock salt has given rise to many different theories ; 
but that most commonly accepted is the one advocated in 
Sir Andrew Ramsay's Physical Geology of Great Britain.
In an 
address to the Carlisle Scientific Society on the " Penrith Sand- 
stone," delivered at Nunnery Walks in the summer of 1880, I gave 
a resume of these theories, with some additional remarks bearing 
upon this important subject.
IV.
In the Fourth, and remaining Division are placed the compounds 
of the Elements with Oxygen.
This group includes all the chief 
rock-forming minerals of our district, as well as some of the mineral 
compounds that are of much importance in an economic respect.
Protoxides.
In the British Museum list the first of our minerals included in 
this category is Melaconite, Tenorite, or Copper Monoxide.
Townshend Hall states that this ore of copper occurs at Roughten 
Gill along with Chalcopyrites (" Towanite") and Brewsterite.
I 
have not seen a specimen of Melaconite from any of our localities, 
but there is every reason for expecting to meet with it under the 
circumstances that obtain at Roughten Gill and the neighbour- 
hood.
Sesquioxides.
In Hall's Mineralogist's Directory Corundum, Aluminium-Sesqui- 
oxide, is mentioned as occurring along with Tourmaline at Carrick.
This mineral, which amongst its varieties includes the Sapphire 
and the Ruby, as well as the Emery employed in the Arts, is, next 
116 
to the Diamond, the hardest known body.
I have not seen any 
of the Cumberland specimens ; but they are said to occur in the 
form of hexagonal crystals.
It would be interesting to know 
whether this mineral occurs with us in the Hypersthenite of 
Carrick, or whether it was found, where so many other minerals 
were, associated with the quartz-vein traversing the Skidda Granite 
at Brandy Gill.
Next after Corundum, but second in point of economic import- 
ance to none in the list, follows our well-known ore of Iron, 
HAEMATITE, Red Iron Ore, Iron Sesquioxide, or Ferric Oxide.
The mineral is so well known that not much need be added 
here to what has been before written about it.
It occurs in the 
form of pockets, veins, and flots, chiefly in the Carbpniferous 
Limestone Series skirting the Lake District; though here and 
there veins of the same mineral are found traversing the older 
" rocks.
In the same Carboniferous Limestone rocks that form the 
Cross Fell escarpment and the great upland tract of mining country 
that extends away to the east and the north-east from the line of 
the Pennine Faults, Haematite is nearly or quite unknown : the 
iron ores occurring there being chiefly the Iron Carbonate, and 
the hydrated oxide known as Limonite.
The origin of our deposits of haematite is a subject I have felt a 
keen interest in ever since the time when I picked up a piece of 
West Cumberland ore containing perfect impressions of Carbon- 
iferous corals and encrinites while geologically surveying the 
railway sections near Tebay in 1867.
Since that time my official 
connection with the Geological Survey has enabled me to collect a 
large store of facts and observations bearing upon this important 
subject.
These, it is to be hoped, will appear eventually in the 
regular Survey publications, and they cannot, therefore, be more 
than referred to here.
So far as my own observations have gone, they long since led 
me to a similar conclusion to that so ably advocated by our Associ- 
ation Secretary, Mr. Kendall, in his paper on the Hcematite Deposits 
117 
of West Cumberland* and in others, published in various scientific 
journals.
Mr. Kendall has brought forward abundant evidence to 
convince anyone that the haematite is a substitutional deposit, 
which has, in some way or another, taken the place of part of the 
chemically-altered rock adjoining the natural fissures.
I would, 
myself, further, attribute this replacement, not to the infiltration of 
a ferriferous solution during the deposition of the Red Bocks, but 
to the complex series of changes initiated by the infiltration of 
mineral solutions soaking downward through the New Red strata 
after their deposition.
Where permeable strata underlaid the New 
Red these solutions were diffused throughout a considerable mass 
of rock, and affected them in few other ways than by staining.
But where the downward flow was arrested by meeting with strata 
impermeable except along certain divisional planes, the solutions 
were concentrated along those planes, and were kept in contact 
with the adjoining rock long enough to initiate the important 
chemical changes that have ended with the replacement of portions 
of the rock by haematite.
That this process of replacement was a 
very gradual process, and the result of feebly acting causes continued 
through a long period, is, I think, sufficiently evidenced by the 
mineralisation of such specimens as that above referred to.
Slight 
as is the difference either in the physical characteristics, or in the 
chemical composition, between the carbonate of lime of the car- 
boniferous fossils, and that of the limestone matrix enclosing them, 
it has been a difference sufficient to determine whether the delicately- 
adjusted chemical forces should act by removing all the carbonate 
of lime of the one, leaving the space formerly occupied by the 
fossil empty ; or whether, concurrently with this, it should, while 
removing the carbonate of lime of the matrix, replace it atom by 
atom with other compounds, and end by converting it entirely into 
solid ore.
The almost perfect gradation traceable, in the case where the 
matrix consists of carbonate of lime, from this, through stained, and 
dolomitized rock into the hematite, may often be traced in hand

118 
specimens ; and the one extreme shades into the other in such a 
manner that it is occasionally hard to say where the altered rock 
ends and the ore begins.
I remember noticing, when the haematite was being worked 
in Harcla Pastures, in 1872, that even crystals of calcite had 
been replaced by pseudomorphs of haematite, while the charac- 
teristic appearance of the original crystal was still retained.
The 
same deposit of haematite traversed beds of limestone wherein 
chert nodules occur.
In this case the carbonate of lime of the 
limestone was alone replaced by the haematite, while the nodules 
of chert remained, in some cases, to all appearance quite unaltered, 
and appeared as flinty nodules surrounded by the ore of iron.
It 
is probably to this selective action that the conversion of the galls 
of calcareous shale in the Carboniferous Rocks and of the fragments 
and pebbles of a calcareous nature in the New Red Breccias into 
a kind of haematite is in great part due.
The replacement has 
proceeded so far in a few cases as to mislead observers into 
believing that the pseudomorphs represent veritable pebbles, and 
that the haematite is therefore older than the deposit they occur in.
Much of the limestone adjoining the haematite veins is often 
changed more or less into Dolomite, from the infiltration of 
Magnesium Carbonate ; and this Dolomite seems to graduate 
further into Siderite, or Iron Carbonate.
Many of the drusy 
cavities occurring along with the Haematite where it is found in 
limestone may be due to the contraction or shrivelling up of the 
rock consequent upon its general diminution in bulk in passing 
from the unaltered condition to the state of Dolomite.
It seems 
possible that this partial rearrangement of the constituents of the 
calcareous rocks adjoining the veins may, to a certain extent, have 
favoured the deposition of the haematite.
Traces of Haematite are found here and there through all the 
Carboniferous Limestone tract that skirts the Lake District ; but 
although a few hundred tons or so have been obtained near Kirkby 
Stephen, and smaller quantities have occasionally been met with 
here and there in other parts, it is not until we follow the outskirts 
of the Lake District round to West Cumberland that deposits ot 
119 
any great importance are met with.
Without doubt such deposits 
will hereafter be found in Edenside when the district shall be 
explored under the guidance of competent persons having that 
special object in view.
In all the parts of the Carboniferou.s 
Limestone Series whence the Red Rocks have been, geologically 
speaking, lately denuded.
Haematite may be looked for with some 
prospect of success.
In form our ore varies from earthy ruddle, through the mammil- 
lated aggregations with a more or less radiating fibrous structure, 
to the beautifully crystalline varieties known as Specular Iron.
Many of these, although lacking some of the exquisitely beautiful 
iridescence observable on the specimens of the same kind of ore 
from Elba and elsewhere, are yet of very great beauty ; and there 
are Cumberland specimens in the British Museum, the Collection 
of Minerals at the Museum of Practical Geology, and the fine 
private collection of the late Professor Harkness that, for lustre 
and beautiful play of colours, will bear favourable comparison with 
specimens from any part of the world.
1,491,440 tons of this ore, worth ;^i, 154,6 13 were raised in 
Cumberland alone in the year 1880.
Another ore of iron very commonly distributed throughout our 
district, and yet differing from haematite inasmuch as it never occurs 
in any considerable quantity, is Ilmenite, Titanic Iron, or Ferric 
Titanate.
Unlike the other metallic ores, this rarely occurs here in 
the form of veins; but it is found as a constituent of our crystalline 
rocks ; most commonly in the rocks of an igneous origin.
The best 
example of its occurrence I am acquainted with is that of the 
Hypersthenite of Carrick, wherein it occurs in the form of irregular 
granular masses of a silvery-steel lustre and colour, "and generally 
more or less of a black tarnish, amongst the crystals of Hypersthene 
or Diallage and of plagioclase felspar that constitute the bulk of 
that rock.
The Gabbro found at Walla Crag, Hawes Water, and 
that of Cuns Fell, near Melmerby, also yield the same mineral.
Similar remarks apply to Magnetite; for although this ore 
occurs abroad in lodes and large masses in quantities sufificient to 
120 
constitute It an important ore of iron, with us It occurs chiefly, 
perhaps almost exclusively, in the form of granules disseminated 
throughout the mass of many of our igneous rocks.
In Vol. ii.
p. 565 of the Geological Magazine, I called attention 
to the occurrence of a mineral new to the British list in the 
Hjematite mines of West Cumberland.
This is Hausmannite, 
the tetragonal form of Manganese Protoxide and Sesquioxide ; or, 
according to some, Manganese Deutoxide.
Since the notice appeared, Mr. Kendall informs me that 
considerable quantities of the ore have been found.
An ore of considerable commercial importance, when found in 
large quantities, is Pyrolusite, Manganese Bin-Oxide, which 
differs from Hausmannite in crystallizing in the Rhombic instead 
of in the Tetragonal system.
This ore of manganese is very 
generally diffused throughout our district, but nowhere occurs in 
workable quantities.
It is found in greater or lesser abundance in 
association with most veins of iron, and is also found along with 
the lead and copper ores of the Caldbeck Fells.
One very 
common form of the mineral is that of the singular dendritic, or 
moss-like aggregations that occur on the divisional planes of many 
of our harder rocks, especially on the Penrith Sandstone.
A very 
beautiful example of this kind was presented to the Carlisle 
Museum by my colleague Mr. Colvin, and others exist in most 
collections, where they are not unfrequently regarded as examples 
of fossil plants.
This ore is much used in the preparation of oxygen for various 
purposes, and the beautiful amethystine tint it imparts to glass 
is turned to account in neutralizing the objectionable bottle-green 
tint resulting from the ferruginous impurities occurring in the 
materials employed in glass manufacture.
Like the ores of iron, this ore of Manganese seems to have its 
origin connected in some way or another with the deposition of 
our Red Rocks.
Hydrated Sesquioxides.
Under this head comes the important ore of iron known as 
LiMONiTE, Brown Haematite, hydrated Iron Sesquioxide, or Ferric 
Hydrate.
Mention has already been made of the occurrence of 
this ore amongst the vein-stuff associated with the lead ores along 
the higher parts of the district around Cross Fell.
Its mode of occurrence suggests that, in this case, at least, it is 
simply Haematite altered in situ.
The ore graduates into the 
surrounding limestone in the same way that much of the Haematite 
does, and the individual masses frequently present the peculiar 
mammillated and botiyoidal forms, and the radiating fibrous 
structure observable in the Haematite itself.
Indeed, although 
the characteristic brown streak of the Limonite is easily obtained, 
these Cross Fell deposits are sufficiently like the West Cumberland 
ore to have been described more than once as genuine Haematite.
I have elsewhere expressed my belief that the great upland tract 
where these occur is merely the modified descendant of the great 
plain that, before its continuity was interrupted by the Faults, once 
extended beneath the New Red over a very large part of the North 
of England.
And just as I regard the Haematite occurring in the 
low ground of Edenside as the result of infiltration from the lately- 
denuded New Red still represented in the neighbourhood, so I 
would refer the origin of these deposits of Limonite to infiltration 
from part of the eastward extension of these same beds, and would 
regard their present hydrated condition as being due to the greater 
length of exposure they have undergone.
Another form of hydrated iron oxide occurring in Cumberland 
and Westmorland is Turgite.
Part of the ore occurring at Aral 
Head, or Ardale Head, near Cross Fell, is referable to this species, 
as are also some botryoidal masses with a radiating fibrous structure 
occurring in the haematite mines near Harcla, Westmorland.
GcETHiTE, the Rhombic Monohydrated Ferric Oxide, frequently 
occurs in association with Haematite and Limonite.
I have not 
yet noticed it myself; but it has been found in West Cumberland 
by our Association Secretary, Mr. Kendall.
122 
Manganite, the Monohydrated Manganese Oxide, which is 
isomorphous with Goethite, has already been mentioned as occurring 
at Force Crag Mine, near Keswick, in association with Smaltine, 
Tourmaline, Stoltzite, Cerussite, Blende, and many other minerals.
It will probably be detected when properly looked for also in the 
Roughten Gill Mines, especially around Dry Gill ; but I have not 
yet seen a specimen from our district myself.
The commonest ore of Manganese, at least in the Caldbeck 
Fells, is the amorphous.
Hydrous Peroxide of Manganese, known 
as PsiLOMELANE.
This occurs in considerable abundance at Dry 
Gill Mine, where the barrel-shaped crystals of Mimetesite or 
Kampylite are found.
Beautiful specimens of both of these are in 
the British Museum, the Museum of Practical Geology, the Hark- 
ness Collection, and others.
This, like Pyrolusite, is a valuable ore of Manganese, but, unless 
it occurs in large quantities, it hardly pays for working at places 
where transport is costly.
The most important rock-constituent in our district is, without 
doubt, one form or another of the mineral Quartz.
As the mode 
of occurrence of this mineral in the Lake District has already been 
treated of by Mr. Ward in Vol. iii.
of our Transactions and else 
where, it would be out of place for me to repeat any of his 
observations here.
The mineral, in one form or another, is to be 
found almost everywhere ; but in the form of veins it is found but 
rarely in the Carboniferous Rocks, and hardly ever in any of the 
newer rocks of our district, There is abundant proof that this is 
owing to the fact that most of the quartz veins traversing the older 
rocks of the Lake District are of older date than the Carboniferous 
period.
Veins of quartz of Carboniferous age do, however, occur, 
and there is this of interest about many of these Carboniferous 
quartz veins — that they afford remarkable instances of a kind of 
replacement, similar in its nature to that of the Haematite, the 
Dolomite, and one or two other minerals already referred to.
One 
instance of this kind, well known by name, is that of the Great 
Sulphur Vein of the Alston district.
This has already been 
123 
pointed out to the Carlisle Scientific Society on our Whit-Monday 
excursion to Melmerby in 1880.
The vein there coincides, as 
such veins nearly always do, with the line of a fault ; and right 
and left of the line of the fault the limestone adjoining the vein is, 
in great measure, replaced by rock of a more or less silicious 
nature, which, in its most highly-altered portions graduates into 
pure vitreous quartz.
In the less-highly-altered portions of the 
vein the bedding and the traces of fossils are distinctly visible.
Several other veins of this nature are to be found elsewhere in 
Edenside : one set occurring at the Scordale Mines near Roman 
Fell ; while another equally well marked set occurs close to the 
head-waters of the Eden near Hanging Lunds in Mallerstang.
Here the limestone adjoining the veins has been altered to a width 
of nearly fifty feet at one place into a hard silicious quartzite, 
which, nearer the centre of the vein, graduates into pure vitreous 
and crystalline quartz.
Like the Hsematite, the Quartz in this 
case exercises a well-marked selective influence ; and, while the 
limestone fragments of the fault-breccia in each case are more or 
less metamorphosed, the accompanying fragments of sandstone 
and of shale remain in their original condition, just as do the chert 
nodules in the case of the Haematite deposit at Harcla, already 
mentioned.
All these veins contain Pyrites, and at least traces of Copper — 
generally in the form of either Chalcopyrites, or else in that of 
Chessylite or of Malachite.
Other minerals are rare.
Nearly all the metalliferous veins of the Lake District are quartz 
veins, which is probably due to the fact that, as veins, they date 
from Precarboniferous times, and that, once formed, they have 
acted as upward vents for thermal springs from the date of their 
formation down to the time when they received their latest deposits 
of ore.
No one can look at the spongy quartz — so light and 
cellular that it will almost float — that is found in the Caldbeck 
Fells and elsewhere, without feeling assured that its present 
condition points to a long and complex series of changes it has 
undergone in the course of the long geological periods that have 
elapsed since its formation.
124 
(Quartz crystals, as is well known, occur along with the Hematite, 
perhaps as one result of the complex series of chemical changes 
initiated by the infiltration of the solutions that brought down 
the Gypsum, the Rock Salt, and the Carbonate of Magnesia into 
the Red Rocks.
Crystals of quartz occur now and then lining the 
interior of Carboniferous fossils, but such instances are far from 
common.
Quartz is not the only form of Silica that occurs in Edenside.
Chalcedony, which is regarded as a mixture of the crystalline 
form of quartz with the opaline form, is found here and there, 
generally in association with nodules of chert, in various parts of 
the Carboniferous Limestone series, notably in the part of the 
Mountain Limestone about the upper part of the Luna Valley 
between Tebay and Ravenstonedale.
The Chert just mentioned is another form of crypto-crystalline 
silica, which differs from flint in having a more splintery fracture, 
and in including, in its impure forms, much Calcic Carbonate in its 
composition.
Chert occurs in interrupted nodules in the Mountain 
Limestone of the part of the Lune Valley just mentioned ; and 
some of these nodules are clearly the result of segregation around 
a fossil nucleus ; generally one of the corals, already partly silicious 
to begin with.
Nodules of chert occur also in particular beds of 
the Yoredale Limestones all through Edenside, as far, at least, as 
Hesket-Newmarket, on the south-west side, and as Renwick, on 
the north-east.
Jasper is another form of crypto-crystalline silica occurring in 
Edenside ; but its mode of occurrence is different from that of any 
of the other forms we have been considering.
Jasper occurs 
principally as one of the constituents of the pebbles that go to 
make up our Upper Old Red Conglomerates — that group of 
conglomerates and sandstones whereof patches are left here and 
there between the Carboniferous Rocks and the Older Palaeozoic 
Rocks of the Lake District.
This Jasper is found in deposits of 
the same age and character on the flanks of the Cheviots ; and as 
many of the rock fragments occurring in our deposits of the Upper 
125 
Old Red are identical with part of the constituents of their chrono- 
logical equivalents on the Border, it may be not altogether unsafe 
to conclude that our Jasper came from some older conglomerate 
out Scotland way, whose disintegration and subsequent rearrange- 
ment have given rise to our Upper Old Red Conglomerates here.
If this view should hereafter prove to be correct, we need not 
wonder that the constituents of our Mell Fell and other Upper 
Old Red deposits do not represent the waste of the rocks of the 
area adjoining.
Yet another form of silica occurs in Edenside.
This is found 
in the form of finely laminated siliceous beds associated with the 
limestones of the Yoredale Rocks.
In the south-eastern part of 
the valley these beds assume considerable importance, and they 
there occasionally pass into beds of nearly pure chert, notwith- 
standing their obviously sedimentary and fossiliferous character.
These beds graduate horizontally into ordinary limestones in one 
direction, and in the opposite direction, where we have reason to 
believe that deep sea conditions obtained during the formation of 
the Yoredale Rocks — they tend to develop into beds a hundred 
or more feet in thickness.
One is tempted to regard these siliceous beds as representing a 
palaeozoic series of deposits of siliceous mud derived, it may be, 
from the exuviae of the Diatoms, Radiolarians, and Sponges 
inhabiting the deep sea at that remote period.
Professor Huxley 
has shewn how deposits of this nature may, by the partial, or the 
total, dissolution and the subsequent redeposition of their siliceous 
particles, be converted into amorphous opaline silica.
Such 
deposits as have lately been brought under the notice of the 
scientific world as one of the results of the Challenger Expedition, 
would give rise to a set of rocks essentially like those I have just 
now referred to, if there were frequent oscillations of level bringing 
about alternate deposits of siliceous mud and calcareous ooze, and 
these again alternating with ordinary sedimentary and drifted 
deposits, as the physical conditions changed, 
The quartz crystals occurring in the Penrith Sandstone, represent 
another and a later period of development.
I have before ex- 
126 
pressed my belief that many of these were formed prior to the 
deposition of the rock in its present form ; as a microscopic 
examination of thin slices of the rock shewed that crystals occur 
with distinct traces of the kind of attrition that would be produced 
by rolling, and with both the worn and the unworn portions of the 
crystal alike coated with the film of Haematite that is generally 
supposed to have been produced contemporaneously with the 
deposition of the rock material itself.
That other crystals occurring in the same rock have been 
actually built up around grains of sand in situ, and subsequently to 
the formation of the rock, I am now quite convinced from a 
microscopic examination of other preparations of the rock shewn 
me by my friend Mr. WilUam Atkinson of Penrith, and by Mr.
John Arthur PhilUps, F.R.S.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF THE ULLSWATER 
DISTRICT.
By WILLIAM HODGSON.
(Read at Penrith, 1 882 J 
The boundaries of the district referred to in these notes may be 
briefly described as coinciding with the water-shed of the lake and 
its tributaries.
This area comprises portions of the two counties 
of Cumberland and Westmorland, the latter county claiming 
precedence in point of extent.
It embraces The entire parishes of 
Patterdale and Martindale, and the upper part of Barton ; the 
whole of Watermillock, a considerable portion of Matterdale, and 
the western extremity of Dacre.
Portions of Watermillock and Dacre towards the lower end of 
the lake rest upon the Old Red Sandstone conglomerate.
On 
Moordivock the Mountain Limestone forms the surface, but the 
major portion of the rugged hills that embosom the lake are of 
volcanic origin.
The arable portion of the district has, within my experience, 
undergone considerable modifications.
Extensive tracts of common, 
inclosed rather more than fifty years ago, had been brought under 
tillage just previous to my first sojourn in Watermillock.
Large 
crops were raised upon the virgin soil, which, in a few years, 
began to decline, until gradually the cultivation of cereals was 
abandoned, and the numerous Cruciferae, Papaveraceae, and other 
crop-weed.s, have, in consequence, almost entirely disappeared.
The 
district is peculiarly rich in grasses, sedges, rushes, and sub-aquatic 
128 
plants, using this adjective in its botanical sense.
The lake itself 
from its rocky, or clear gravelly bottom, is comparatively barren of 
vegetation ; greatly resembling in this particular the secluded lake 
of Ennerdale.
In running my fingers along the columns of the London Catalogue 
of British Plants, 7th Edition, 1877, 1 find that nearly five hundred 
and twenty different species of plants may be claimed as indigenous 
to the district, exclusive of Ferns, Equiseta, Lycopods, and Mosses.
A fair proportion also of casuals, waifs of cultivation, &c., may be 
found, whose introduction into the neighbourhood would appear 
almost unaccountable under ordinary circumstances.
Amongst 
these casuals I may mention Camelina sativa, which I found in 
1878 growing near the course of a stream flowing into Dacre Beck.
On subsequent enquiry it appeared that the soil where it was found 
had been shot there out of the grounds of an old residence close 
by, where the plant had, in former times, been grown along with 
Flax.
A yet more curious instance happened to me so recently as 
October last.
Passing along the road near the old steamboat 
landing at Ploshgate, my eye caught some diminutive purple- 
flowering plants growing on the gravel bed there.
I got over the 
rails to examine the spot, and was surprised to find several other 
plants, all of which I thought were exotics.
I afterwards found 
that one of the residents in the neighbourhood had brought away 
from Mr. Seatree's, in Penrith, a quantity of refuse cleared out 
from a corn-dressing machine, and had been in the habit of 
throwing it on the gravel where the plants were found, to feed his 
poultry ; and here was the result.
Among others was a plant of 
the Sinapis tribe which in its younger condition of growth his 
daughter had cut and used as an ingredient in a salad.
It cannot of course be expected that in the limits of a paper like 
the present I should be able to descend to minute particulars of 
each of the five hundred plants to be found within the area I have 
mentioned.
I will therefore describe such particular species of 
each family as I may deem expedient, either on account of their 
beauty, comparative rarity, or economic utility.
Before doing so, 
129 
I would just remark that during the three last summers I have 
spent some time in endeavouring to verify the accuracy of the lists 
of unusual plants of the district left behind by former observers, 
including the Rev. W.
Richardson of Dacre; Mr. N.
J. Winch of 
Newcastle; Rev. J.
Harriman of Eaglescliffe, Durham; Mr. Hutton 
of Keswick, and others.
Several plants named by these gentlemen 
as occurring in the vicinity of Ullswater have hitherto eluded my 
observation ; while, on the other hand, I have found many which 
they either had not discovered, or, at any rate, if found, had not 
recorded.
Of the first family in the Catalogue, the Ranunculace^, I may 
mention the occurrence of Thalidrum alpinum in some of the 
little rills at the eastern base of Helvellyn, close to the head of the 
Red Tarn.
Hundreds may be collected there, but I have never 
yet been able to find them in the flowering stage, or even with 
stems fairly developed.
Another of the family, Thalictrum minus, 
\ax.
Jlexuosum, may be found on both shores of the lake, where 
dry gravel beds occur.
Ranunculus fiuitans, a most peculiar 
looking plant, may be seen in the bed of the River Eamont a little 
below Pooley Bridge.
As far as I can discover, I have been the 
first to notice its existence in Cumberland.
Its long, delicate, 
thread-likelstems, of a light green colour,' form a very pretty object 
floating^n the water and waving backwards and forwards in the 
current.
Its leaves are all submersed, forked, and setaceous.
In 
a rapid stream the flowers are rarely developed ; but where the 
roots are anchored behind some protecting block of stone, its 
lovely white flowers may be found about midsummer.
Examples 
occur close to the ancient weir at the Eelstank.
Aquilegia vulgaris 
may also be found on the Cumberland shore of the lake, about 
half a mile above Gowbarrow Hall, and near the mouth of Airey 
Beck.
Last summer I was astonished to discover this plant 
growing in a rugged ravine on the mountain side, immediately 
above Dowthwaite Head, at an elevation of little under 1500 feet 
above sea level, on the face of rocks perennially wet with water 
dripping from a still higher level.
9 
130 
The second family, BERBERACEiE, includes only one species, the 
Common Barberry, well known in our gardens and shrubberies.
Next in order stand the NYMPHEACEiE, or Waterlilies, of which 
Nymphea alba occurs in Brothers Water, on the side next to the 
highway, below Brownrigg's hotel.
The PAPAVERACEiE are but poorly represented, having declined 
in numbers considerably with the withdrawal of land from tillage.
One of its members, however, Meconopsis cambrica, appears to have 
estabUshed itself more firmly than of yore, and may be found 
about old walls and hedgerows in close proximity to gardens, 
whence it has probably escaped.
The next family, the Fumariacea:, have diminished in numbers 
from the same cause as the poppies.
The trailing Corydalis 
claviculata may be noticed in several localities.
It is probably 
best represented by several patches which occur on the Gowbarrow 
Fells, near Collier Hag ; also on the breast of Place Fell, near the 
Patterdale slate-quarries.
The extensive family of Crucifer^e, like the preceding, have 
decreased with the decline of tillage.
One of the rarest of the 
tribe, Raphanus raphanistrum, may be seen occasionally about the 
old farmsteads at Bennet Head, in Watermillock.
Another com- 
paratively scarce member of the family is Arabis hirsnta.
It 
appears on the conglomerate rock at Sparket Mill, just where the 
tail race re-enters Dacre Beck.
Our friends in Penrith may find 
this plant on the top of the wall on Slapestones brow, and about 
the gateway leading to the Red Hills lime works.
The little hairy 
rosette in which the root leaves are enveloped, before the stem 
shoots forth, affords an admirable example of simplicity and 
completeness in arrangement of the parts intended for the protection 
of the plant from injury during the early stages of its growth.
Cochlearia officitialis, v.
alpma, is to be found in many of the 
mountain rills.
It is difficult perhaps to make out that this plant 
differs materially from C.
officinalis; and I question the propriety 
of increasing the number of species in our lists on apparently 
trivial, and, it may be, accidental, varieties of form.
I have 
131 
already referred to the circumstances under which I have observed 
Camelina sativa.
Teesdalia nudicaulis occurs on dry hill-sides in 
different parts of the district, especially where the surface has been 
disturbed.
The only member of the CiSTACEiE is probably Helianthemum 
vulgare, which flourishes among the limestone rocks that crop out 
to the surface on Moordivock.
A patch of it occurs by the road 
side not far from the foot of Slapestones brow, going in the direction 
of the old Snuff-Mill.
Of the ViOLACEiE several species occur.
Viola odorata is found 
by the road side near Watermillock House, where, as well as at 
the summit of Slapestones, it may rank as a casual.
Viola lutea 
is extremely abundant and widely distributed in the district.
It is 
a very handsome species, and I have a pleasant recollection of the 
manner in which I saw some meadows above the village of Dockray, 
in Matterdale, enamelled with its flowers in the summer of 1880.
A variety with petals wholly yellow occurs near the footpath leading 
from Stoddah to Penruddock, not far from the former place.
Viola 
flavicornis, on the rocks near Kailpot Crag.
Droserac^.
Of the many thousand plants of Drosera that I 
have observed growing in the boggy grounds at the base of every 
mountain, they have ever turned out to be specimens of Drosera 
rotundifolia.
It has the reputation of being to some extent sensi- 
tive, and, as many writers allege, insectivorous ; its beautifully 
fringed leaves, closing upon the unwary fly that may settle upon 
them, and preventing all escape, until the juices of the insect's 
body have been in some myslerious manner absorbed by the plant* 
Whether such food is essential to the health of the vegetable, I 
cannot undertake to affirm ; but the fact is undoubted, that a very 
great majority of the leaves of the Sundew are found to contain the 
remains of insects so entrapped and destroyed.
Of the PoLYGALACE/E we possess but one species, Polygala 
vulgaris, of frequent occurrence on mountainous heaths.
A very 
pretty little plant, the flowers varying much in the hue of their 
132 
petals, being sometimes white, sometimes delicate rosy-pink, and 
sometimes bright blue.
The CARYOPHYLLACEiE is a somewhat extensive group, which 
has many species of frequent occurrence.
Sap07iaria officifialis, 
old writers say, grew in their time at Akebeck Bridge, near Pooley, 
and also near Howtown.
I have examined both stations without 
success.
Silene injiata, at th e top of SI apeston es.
Stellaria nemorum, 
uncommon in many parts of Cumberland, is fairly plentiful.
It is found by many brooklets in Watermillock ; and in the summer 
of 1878, I noticed it growing far up in the mountain ravine 
at the head of Fusedale, in Martindale.
Its congener, the Common 
Chickweed, is one of the most formidable pests of what Httle 
agriculture remains to us.
Sagina apdala is not unusual by road 
sides and at the edges of cultivated ground, though far less plentiful 
than 5.
procumbens.
For the benefit of Penrith folk again, I may 
state that the former species may be found by the side of the 
highway going towards Carlton, on the left hand.
Of the iLLECEBRACEiE, Only a single species is found among us, 
and that but very rarely.
This is Scleranthus animus, sometimes 
met with at the edges of cornfields.
In the West of Cumberland, 
where this plant is more frequent, it seems to prefer soils of an 
argillaceous nature.
Of the PoRTULACE^ we possess only one species, Montia 
fontana, the brilliant green chickweed-like foliage of which may be 
seen in almost every mountain spring or "well eye." 
HvPERiCACEiE.
Inasmuch as many members of this genus 
affect sub-alpine regions, our district produces more than an average 
quota.
Hypericum androsmmmn is found only in some old-fashioned 
gardens as an ornamental shrub, and cannot fairly be regarded as 
indigenous.
H. tretrapterum loves moisture, and is frequently 
found where its roots are always submerged.
Very fine specimens 
occur in rills on the pastures above Glencoin farm, on the Cum- 
berland side of the brook which here forms the boundary line 
between Cumberland and Westmorland.
H. htimifustim, the least 
member of the family, is of common occurrence on dry banks, 
133 
especially by woodland hedgerows.
Near the bridge at Hartsope, 
and elsewhere.
Malvaceae.
Althcea officinalis, a plant largely used by the rural 
population as an emollient for sprains and swellings, is chiefly 
found about the boundaries of old gardens and orchards, nowhere, 
perhaps, truly wild.
Its congener, however, Malva moschaia^ 
frequently makes its appearance about quarry grounds, where its 
roots strike deeply into the rubbish heaps thrown aside by the 
workmen.
A very handsome plant bearing large flowers of rosy-pink 
hue, with deeply-notched petals.
About Birk-Crag quarry, &c.
TiLiACE^.
Of this family only one member is present, Tilia 
europcea, or T.
intermedia, of De Candolle and other writers ; the 
Common Lime Tree of our shrubberies and avenues.
LiNACEyE is represented by a single member, Linum catkarticum, 
of almost universal occurrence, from an altitude of 2000 feet to the 
level of the lake.
GERANiACEiE.
Of this elegant genus of plants, many representa- 
tives are indigenous to the district.
Geranium ph<Kum is found on 
a shady hedgebank at Stock 's-n 00k, in Watermillock, an outcast 
possibly from the ancient garden of the mansion-house.
G. lucidum, 
with its glossy leaves, which assume a lively reddish tinge when the 
plant has reached maturity, is everywhere common in the vicinity 
of dwellings.
The well-known Oxalis acetosella is abundant.
iLiCACEiE, of which the Common Holly is the only British 
species, also has its home with us.
In the woods about Gowbarrow 
and Lyulph's Tower, as well as in many parts of Patterdale, this 
fine evergreen grows luxuriantly and spontaneously.
Celastrace.'e, like the last mentioned genus, can boast of only 
a single type indigenous to Britain, Euonymus europceus, which old 
writers mention as occurring by the shore of the lake in Gowbarrow 
Park, where I have hunted for it without success.
RHAMNACEiE includes but two British species.
I only refer to 
it here, because in the course of last summer I detected one of its 
members growing near the top of Slapestones.
In the absence of 
134 
blossom or fruit, I failed to identify the shrub correctly, and it has 
lately been cut down.
It will, I trust, sprout again from the 
bottom, and so enable some of our members to identify the plant.
I believe it to be Rhamnus catharticus.
SAPiNDACEiE.
Of these forest trees, the Common Sycamore, 
Acer pseudo-platanus, alone claims notice.
It appears to have 
been greatly appreciated by the rude forefathers of our several 
hamlets, almost every toft being sheltered by its umbrageous 
branches.
At Rattlebeck, in Glenridding, a splendid specimen 
may be seen.
Leguminifer^e.
Of this most extensive family, we cannot 
pretend to have more than a moderate share of species.
Of Gorse, 
or Whins, two species are of frequent occurrence.
Three forms of 
Broom are likewise found.
The Common Rest-harrow appears at 
rare intervals, in deep soils of dry sandy nature.
Respecting the 
next plant in the catalogue, Anthyllis vulneraria, I feel tempted to 
ofifer a passing remark or two.
Frequently as I have found it 
growing in Cumberland within the last quarter of a century, it has 
ever been in some locality — some railway-cutting or embankment 
— some quarry ground — near some coal or iron-ore mine, &c., 
where the surface has been disturbed to some depth ; and in 
accord with my previous experience, I spied my old friend this 
summer on the railway embankment by the viaduct on the Penrith 
side of Redhills farm, where its sulphur-coloured blossoms appeared 
in some quantity.
I would gladly ascertain if the fact I have just 
stated be in accordance with the experience ^of any plant-loving 
members of the Penrith Scientific Society.
Five or six Clovers 
may be reckoned as indigenous with us, exclusive of two species of 
Bird's-foot Trefoil ; and four Vetches, the least plentiful being 
Vicia atigustifolia, which is found on a hedge bank in front of 
Hurrock Wood, and Orobus tuberosus, which is to be found in most 
of our meadows.
The variously tinted purple flowers of this species 
are exceedingly handsome.
In the summer of 1878, a specimen 
having a corolla entirely of creamy white was brought to me by a 
friend ; it had been gathered by the road side near Spark et.
135 
Rosacea, the Rose tribe, another numerous group, including 
roses proper, plums, cherries, strawberries, brambles, &c.; taken 
altogether, a very interesting and difficult genus to deal with, of 
which a few examples may be briefly noticed.
Spiraea salicifolia, 
a shrub hardly naturalised, but found about old garden hedgerows.
Alchemilla alpina, plentiful on the highest bluffs of our mountains.
In Swarthbeck, near Raven Crag, it forms the chief constituent of the 
scanty vegetation.
Comariim palustre, in boggy localities frequent ; 
in Bannerdale Bottoms very fine specimens are met with.
Riibus 
idceus, abundant everywhere up to an altitude of 1500 feet or 
upwards.
R. ccesius, at the foot of the lake; abundant near 
Redhills.
R. saxatilis, in Airey-beck, above the hamlet of Dockray, 
in Matterdale ; on Hallin Fell, Martindale.
&c.
R. chaviccmorus 
» 
said to grow on Ladepot, above Howtown, though 1 have not seen 
it there.
Of the sub-family of Geum, or Ave?is, all the three known 
members are present with us.
Of Roses we have no great variety 
of species, though such as we do possess are sufficiently numerous 
to make a grand show in our coppices and hedgerows during the 
flowering season.
Rosa rubiginosa occurs in a hedgerow close to 
Watermillock church, where it was planted by a former rector, at 
the time of the inclosure of the commons, some fifty years ago.
Lythrace^.
Lythrum salicaria alone appears.
It grows 
sparingly in the bog known as Black Dyke, near Baldhow ; though 
far from reaching the vigorous growth I have seen the same plant 
assume in West Cumberland, and especially in some boggy places 
on the banks of the River Ehen, not far from Frizington.
Onagrace^.
The Willow Herbs are abundant, from the larger 
Epilobium angusti/olium, and E.
hirsutunt, down to the dwarf 
E. alsinifolium, which is found in many of the alpine springs.
Fine examples occur in the rills on Kirkstone Pass.
Both forms 
of Enchanter's Nightshade grow by the lake, and in the neighbouring 
woods.
Millefolium, Water Milfoil, abounds in the lake and many 
of its feeders.
Two varieties of Callilric/ie, Water Starwort, also 
abound in slow running mountain rills.
Some fine specimens 
grow in Bannerdale Bottoms, also in the^boggy meadows at the 
head of Brother's Water.
136 
Of the Grossulariace^, stray plants occur certainly, but only 
as waifs from cultivation.
Crassulace>e.
In these the district is rich.
Sedum rhodiola 
grows upon the rocks on Striding Edge, hard by the place where 
the unfortunate Mr. Gough perished in 1806.
6".
telephium is 
common.
S. album, by the lake shore at Raven Crag, and also at 
the foot of the lake.
They who have visited the old slate quarries 
at Patterdale, may have seen a wonderful carpeting of S.
acre on 
the roadway there.
S. re^exum on old walls about the curtilages 
of dwellings.
Our village maidens call it " Love in a chain." 
SAXiFRAGACEiE.
Another well-represented family.
Saxifraga 
oppositifolia, growing on the same rocks with Sedum rhodiola, 
flowers too early in the season to be noticed by most of the lake 
visitors.
6".
stellaris and S.
aizoides both abound in watery places.
The former I have observed within a few feet of the summit of 
Helvellyn.
^. hypnoides, in many of the higher ravines.
About 
the workmen's sheds at the Cawdale Moor quarries it is very 
abundant ; and really forms a velvety cushion for the floors of some 
of the now roofless huts.
Both types of Golden Saxifrage may be 
found ; and the handsome Grass of Parnassus gladdens the eyes 
of every mountain rambler in the autumn season, when alone it is 
seen to perfection.
UMBELLiFERiE.
There being upwards of sixty species included 
in the catalogue of such plants indigenous to Britain, of which the 
district cannot claim quite twenty, it cannot be held that our flora 
of umbellifers is a complete one.
There are, however, two or 
three species which ought not to pass unnoticed.
Sanicula europoea: 
Unsheltered situations; not rare.
Near Beauthorn and Croft Head, 
very fine ; also near Waterfoot boat-shed.
Pimpinella saxifraga: 
the commonest of the genus in the later summer months; in 
meadows and copses not unfrequent.
Peucedanum ostruihium: as 
this is somewhat of a botanical rarity, I was surprised to find a 
stray plant near the mouth of the Airey rivulet three years ago.
I have since seen it in abundance by the same stream, just below 
Dowthwaite Head.
Cow-leeches of old used it in their practice, 
137 
and I find that it shares with Helleboriis viridis the name of 
"FelUn gers." Myrrhis odorata : this plant, again, from its 
constantly appearing about homesteads and calf-paddocks, has had 
some economical use among our forefathers.
In Lamplugh, how- 
ever, and in most parts of Ennerdale, it is not so exclusively 
confined to the vicinity of dwellings, but appears by mountain 
brooklets almost universally.
(Enanthe crocata, " Deed-tung," at 
Waterfoot, and also near Winter Crag.
AraliacejE.
Only one species, the Common Ivy, is recognised 
as indigenous.
Caprifoliace^,.
Satubucus ebiilus, another plant of some 
reputation among the old herbalists.
A large patch of this unusual 
plant grows near the farm house at Glencoin, where I am informed 
it is occasionally sought after yet.
Of its reputed virtues I possess 
no information.
Viburnum opulus : a common shrub in woods 
and hedges ; handsome when in flower, and even lovelier when in 
autumn wax-like scarlet-tinted berries adorn its branches in profu- 
sion.
Of the Common Honeysuckle I need not attempt any 
description.
RuBiACE^.
Galium boredle occurs on both shores of the lowest 
reach of Ullswater.
Its flowering season is more brief than that of 
its congeners; and hence the plant is perhaps liable to be over, 
looked.
Once seen, it cannot afterwards be mistaken for any of 
the other members of the family.
G. verum: not unfrequent in 
dry, sandy soils.
G. palustre: a weak and straggling plant, which 
loves boggy- or peaty ground.
Asperula odorata: a pretty little 
plant, affecting dry rocky woods and coppices.
Scented when dry, 
and retaining its pleasant odour for years.
The peasantry of 
Cumberland frequently dry the pretty whorled leaves, which they 
call, not inaptly, "Star-gers".
Valerianace^.
Valeriana dioica: of wide distribution and 
frequent occurrence in upland meadows, especially where drainage 
has been neglected.
Its white petals, bordered externally with 
pink, are seen early in the season around " totter bogs." Valeri- 
anella olitoria : not usually occurring here, though frequent in the 
138 
lower portions of Cumberland.
Used by our forefathers as a 
salad-herb, and said to be returning into favour for that purpose.
The species V.
dentata, which flowers later in the season, seems to 
have disappeared entirely, with the absence of cultivation.
DiPSACE^.
Scabiosa sticcisa : few plants are more generally 
diffused than the species now under notice.
Few meadows or 
pastures' are without its almost spherical heads of bluish-purple 
flowers.
In some parts of the county the peasants call it "Hog-a- 
back." The remaining two species, S.
arvensis and ^.
columbaria, 
occur just outside the district.
I have seen them both at Stainton.
Composite.
More than one hundred and fifty species are 
enumerated as belongmg to this division, though hardly one-third 
can be claimed as natives of the district.
Cardims nutans: is more 
plentiful towards Penrith than within the proper limits of the 
UUswater district.
About Redhills it appears by the roadside.
A remarkably well-developed specimen grew within the gateway of 
a field there in 1880.
It was fully seven feet high, and when in 
full vigour of growth the grand-looking plant was disestablished by 
the farmer, and thrown upon the highway, like a hawk nailed to 
the wall of a keeper's outbuildings.
By some writers it is called 
C. acanthoides.
The farmer's bitterest foe is not this species, 
however, but C.
arvensis.
C. lanceolatus is the common Bur 
Thistle.
C. heterophyllus : a very handsome plant ; grows by the 
Airey rivulet near Beck Bottom farm, in Matterdale.
Carlina 
vulgaris: on most of our drier hill-sides.
Serratula tinctoria: 
which the unskilled plant-collector often mistakes for a thistle, 
grows abundantly on the shore at the foot of the lake.
Tanacetum 
vulgare: not very common, and where found seems to be a cast- 
away from gardens.
Filago germanica: a hoary, or cottony-looking 
plant, having usually several side-shoots from the base of the 
leading flower, which eventually overtop it, something after the 
fashion of the Hen-and-chickens Daisy.
From this peculiarity our 
French neighbours call it " herbe mechant." It is found on the 
conglomerate rocks between Waterfoot and Floshgate.
Gnaph- 
alium uliginosum : densely cottony, Uke the preceding, but more 
139 
branched from the base upwards, having smaller flowers.
Frequently 
met with in ditches, and in furrows in corn-fields where water has 
stood during the previous winter.
G. dioicum : I have observed 
this Cudweed only once in the UUswater district, near a place at 
Gowbarrow known as the Coombes ; and there it was so cropped 
by sheep and rabbits that, had I not been familiar of old with the 
plant, I might have passed it over.
It grows plentifully on Brockle 
Crag, on the N.W. of Skiddaw.
Senecio saracenicus : this giant 
member of the Groundsel family appears in a paddock at Thack- 
thwaite ; also near the ancient homesteads at Stoddah, in the 
adjoining township of Hutton Soil.
This proximity to dwellings 
seems to imply that the plant now under notice was at one period 
the object of cultivation.
I'ragopogon jyratensis : of wide distri- 
bution, though nowhere appearing in great numbers.
About 
roadsides and hedge-banks on both sides of the lake.
The plumes 
attached to the upper part of the seeds have a singularly graceful 
appearance, and readily distinguish the Meadow Goat's-beard from 
other members of the Composite tribe.
Two types of Sow-thistle, 
Sonchus asper and aS*.
arvensis, are of frequent occurrence.
The 
large yellow flowers of the latter are occasionally too conspicuous 
in corn crops in the lower parts of Cumberland.
Of the Hawk Weeds proper — a puzzling f a.mi]y— Ilieracium 
pilosella is the most abundant and widely distributed.
On most 
dry banks its hoary procumbent stems and leaves, and its bright 
lemon-coloured flowers, the outer edges tipped with crimson, are 
of common occurrence.
E. anglicum : one of my most recent 
finds, dating only from August, 1881.
I met with it in the ravine 
which descends from the Cawdale slate quarries, near the Brother's 
Water hotel, and after vainly calling in the counsel of local 
botanists, it was ultimately identified by the curator of Kew 
Gardens.
This plant is the H.
cerinthoides of some botanists.
H. umbellatum : except //.
pilosella, this is perhaps the earliest 
flowering member of the family, a circumstance that first led me to 
distinguish it from II.
boreale, the common form seen by waysides 
and the edges of cornfields about harvest time.
CAMPANULACEit. With the pretty little Blue Bell, every child 
140 
that has seen a field or a country lane is probably acquainted.
In 
some parts of the kingdom this is not the case.
A Dorsetshire 
clergyman, a gentleman of Cumberland birth, assured me not long 
ago that this plaut^ — familiar enough to us all here — has no place 
in his parish of over 4000 acres in extent.
Of the fifteen species 
enumerated in the "London Catalogue" as indigenous to Britain, 
the first is Lobelia dortmanna: a plant found growing in shallow 
water around the edges of Ullswater, and other lakes.
It has 
peculiarly-formed, and rather pretty blue flowers, on a slender 
footstalk, rising above the surface of the water to the height of a 
foot or thereabouts.
Abundant in a mountain pond near Giller- 
thwaite in Ennerdale.
Jasione montana : not unfrequent on dry 
banks in Lower Hartsop and Patterdale ; though far from being so 
plentiful as on some of the low sandy hills or " eskers" that lie 
between Aspatria and the Solway.
Campanula glomerata: appears 
just outside the limits of my district, about Gospel How, Penrud- 
dock.
Our Penrith friends may find it about Redhills, as I have 
noticed a few plants near Slapestones top, with clusters of 
purple-coloured flowers.
C. latifolia : a large and handsome 
plant, may be regarded as one of the floral glories of our district 
and county generally.
I recollect some years ago, when Mr.
Hammond, the present head-gardener at Brayton Hall, came first 
into Cumberland, he was greatly struck with the appearance of 
this plant, which he had never previously seen in a wild state.
C. persici/olia: though occasionally seen in gardens, has slight 
claims to be reckoned as a native of our upland valleys.
Ericace^.
In these, as might be expected, our district is rather 
rich.
Vaccinium oxycoccus : is frequently to be found with its 
pretty red solitary flowers on long trailing stems — locally called 
"cranberry wire" — interlaced with heaths, sphagnum, and other 
bog-loving plants.
V. vitis idcea : less plentiful than the preceding, 
loving rather elevated situations, where sufficient moisture prevails, 
in peaty soil.
About Striding Edge, Dove Crags, Fairfield, &c.
I have met with occasional specimens on Gowbarrow Fells, and 
even on Easter Mell Fell.
The flowers are a very pretty object, 
rosy-white, clustered, and having a special gloss about them which 
141 
no wax-work of the deftest lady's hand can rival.
I have not 
often seen its fruit in a ripened state.
V. myrtillus: is more 
common, and better known than either of the preceding.
Arctos- 
taphylos uva-ursi : some of my predecessors in botanical research 
have recorded the presence of this plant in that part of Martindale 
parish known as Dalehead.
Rev. W.
Richardson, formerly vicar 
of Dacre, a gentleman largely responsible for the local catalogue 
of British plants contained in " Hutchinson's History of Cumber- 
land," found it there — where it probably still exists, though I 
cannot personally vouch for the fact.
Urica ietralix : in many parts 
of the district, on moist heathy ground, the delicate blush-tinted 
flowers of this species may be noted in July.
It occurs above 
Sharrow-bay, in Bannerdale Bottoms, and elsewhere, being more 
local than the two following species.
U. cinerea: a taller and 
more robust plant than the last, having three instead of /our leaves 
in a whorl, and lovely spikes of brilliant purple-coloured flowers.
This is the heath that fringes the rocks about Stybarrow, Glen- 
ridding Screes, and other rugged precipitous ground.
Probably 
the finest I ever saw grew in Ennerdale.
Calluna vulgaris : the 
most abundant member of the family, found everywhere on 
mountainous heaths; once largely in use for making besoms.
Superior flavoured honey is said to be collected from its flowers by 
bees, and cottagers in the S.W. of Cumberland frequently carry 
their hives a considerable distance from their place of abode in 
order to station them in a favourable locality among the hills 
during the ling-flowering season.
Pyrola minor : on the authority 
of Hutchinson said to grow near the foot of the avenue leading to 
Dunmallet ; where, however, it has escaped my observation.
My 
search has been far from exhaustive, and I yet hope to establish 
the fact of its existence there.
I have seen the plant years ago in 
Flimby Wood.
The next order, J^sminace^e, includes only the Common Ash 
and the Privet, on which it is unnecessary to dwell.
ApocYNACEiG.
Is Only represented by Vinca minor, which 
appears only in gardens, or in places where its escape from culti- 
vation is manifest.
142 
GentianacEjE.
Krylhrcea centaur'ivm : examples of this plant 
are of extremely rare occurrence within the area to which my notes 
are limited.
When found, it has generally been in some high-lying 
pasture where the subsoil is decidedly argillaceous.
Gentiana 
campestris : the deep purple flowers of this plant may be seen in 
autumn in many of the mountain pastures.
Priest Crag and 
Birch Crag, in Watermillock ; Gowbarrow Fells ; and above Glen- 
coin farm.
Menyanthes trifoliata: in deep boggy ground this 
remarkably beautiful plant is found in the highest perfection.
Gillerthwaite pond, already mentioned, presents a sight to be 
remembered, when the Bog-bean is in full flower.
PoLEMONiACEJi:.
This order includes only one native species, 
Polemonium cceruleum : the well-kown " Poverty" of the cottager's 
garden ; not properly native in any part of Cumberland.
CoNvoLVULACE^.
Convolvulus sepium : this plant, the " cum- 
brous bindweed" of Wordsworth's " Excursion," is found trained 
about the porches in front of cottages and farm-buildings, where its 
appearance is often showy enough.
In some parts of Cumberland 
it is sadly too plentiful.
I have seen hedges literally dragged to 
the earth and ruined by its long trailing stems.
C arvensis and 
C. soldanella are of common occurrence in West Cumberland, the 
latter only among sand on the sea-beach.
SolanacejE.
Solanum dulcamara: a long trailing shrub 
sparingly met with in the district.
Its bunches or trusses of 
flowers strikingly remind one of those of the potato.
Scrophulariace^.
Verhascum thapsus : commonly found 
about mountain quarries ; the " Shepherd's Staff" of the rustic 
population.
It frequently finds its way into gardens.
I have seen 
grand examples of it at Stainton.
Scrophidaria nodosa : of common 
occurrence about the edges of woods, hedgerows, and the banks of 
a brook or river; familiarly designated " Stinking Roger." The 
roots are in high repute with the humbler class of medical botanists, 
by whom I have frequently been solicited to procure them in 
the depth of winter, when the parties were unable to hunt them 
out for themselves.
Digitalis puipurea : in every copse and 
143 
hedgerow.
Linaria cymhalaria : this is a pretty little creeper, 
growing in many places on old walls; generally reputed an alien, 
though there is evidence of its presence amongst us at least three 
hundred years ago.
Cooper, a writer of Queen Elizabeth's day 
(1584), calls it "an herbe that groweth in mud walls, with a leafe 
in fashion like ivy, but much less, and a little purple flower.' 
Mimulus lute.us: this plant, more clearly an alien than the 
preceding, is now thoroughly naturalised, and in parts of the 
district may be seen in vigorous growth about water-courses, 
where its roots are constantly under water.
About Ulcatrow, and 
Dockray, in Matterdale ; also near the old Snuff Mill at Stainton.
Eleven of the nineteen native species of Veronica may be found 
among us.
Veronica hederi/olia : the earliest flowering of the 
genus; appears sparingly in gardens as a weed.
Hallsteads kitchen 
garden.
V. montana: nearly resembling Germander; occurs 
plentifully in Dunmallet; in Dalemain Woods, near the corn-mill; 
in the ravine between Airey Force and Dockray; will also 
probably be found in the woods about Patterdale.
V. scutellata : 
in watery places not uncommon.
Near Bennet Head, and about 
Watermillock, in ditches and water-courses.
Both species of Louse- 
wort, and the Yellow Rattle, "Henpens" of the mowers, exist in 
the district, as does the Red Bartsia, in moist and semi-sterile 
pastures, and by road-sides.
Melamfyrum pratense : appears 
about Airey Force, Dockray, Stybarrow, and similar places.
M. sylvuticum is found in a few wooded localities.
Orobanchace^.
The only member of this order found with 
us is that singular and very rare plant (in Cumberland at least), 
Lathrcea squamaria.
In drying, the whole plant becomes quite 
black.
It is parasitic on the roots of elm, hazel, &c.
Has a 
peculiar habit of disappearing from its recorded stations, again to 
be found at the same place after an indefinite period, I found it 
last year in early June— rather late for this plant— near Lyulph's 
Tower ; and when I visited the place the other day, no trace of its 
existence could be discerned.
Labiate.
About twenty members of this order are produced 
144 
within the boundary of my district.
The following are the most 
remarkable.
Mentha rotundifolia : this, like the Tooth-wort, is of 
very rare occurrence in Cumberland, and, like all the mint family, is a 
late-flowering plant.
By the lake shore from Floshgate downwards: 
plentiful.
Mentha piperita : scarce, like the former ; but occurring 
by the road side below the Cove farm, Watermillock ; also in a 
brook that empties into the Eamont, near Pooley Mill.
Origanum 
vulgare : another unusual plant, which, though a little beyond my 
limits, I notice here as occurring near the top of Slapestones brow, 
and also by the road-side leading thence to Stainton.
Nepeta 
cataria : the existence of this plant in a wild state in the county 
has not been noticed by any previous observer, so far as my 
information extends ; and I hardly dare venture to disclose its 
habitat.
Scutellaria galericulata : this plant, which is of common 
occurrence on the shores of many of our lakes — notably Bassen- 
thwaite and Derwentwater — appears sparingly near the boat-shed 
at Water-foot, and in greater plenty by the River Eamont, not far 
from the old eelstank below Pooley Bridge.
BoRAGiNACE^.
Myosotis ccespitosa : this type of Forget-me-not, 
which is smaller in all its parts than M.
palustris, appears in most 
of the fell-side water-courses.
Several other species are met with 
in different places within the district.
Borago officinalis: this 
plant is a reputed alien, which has become naturalised.
It occurs 
by the road side near Floshgate, and about Watermillock ; probably 
in other places, but always as a waif of cultivation.
The Common 
Comfrey appears only in gardens or in orchards.
Cynoglossum 
omphalodes : an excluded member of the family now under notice, 
grows abundantly in the shrubbery about Hallsteads mansion.
PiNGUicULACEiE.
Piuguicula vulgaris : is abundant in nearly 
all our mountain springs.
One would expect also to find some of 
the curious Bladder-worts in still pools in the valleys, but I have 
not been able to detect their presence there.
Primulace*.
Well represented here by the Common Primrose 
and the Cowslip.
Primula farinosa: in the up.
'nd meadows and 
pastures all round the lake ; in boggy places this very pretty flower 
is abundant.
Lysimachia ntmorum : appears in shady places, 
where water abounds.
L. vulgaris : has been noticed growing 
near the boat-landing at the mouth of Goldrill-beck.
Anagallis 
tenella: a handsome, but diminutive plant; may be found on 
moist rocks in Glencoin ; its flowers grow in pairs.
Plumbaginace.*;.
Not represented here; yet I have an indistinct 
recollection of having once seen a variety of Armeria maritima 
growing at the head of Fusedale, many years ago.
Plantaginace^.
Three of the family of five members are 
produced in abundance.
Littorella Jacustris : a curious little plant 
growing in some quantity by the edge of the lake, especially 
towards the foot ; produced under water, and flowering only when 
the water is dried up.
Chenopodiace^.
Chenopodium bonus henricus : a plant of 
some repute as a culinary vegetable in the olden time, and generally 
found in the neighbourhood of ancient dwellings.
I have, how- 
ever, frequently seen it growing at a considerable elevation on 
Gowbarrpw Fells.
Polygonace^.
Besides the commoner Docks — the agricul- 
turist's foes — we sometimes see Rumex alpinus occupying a corner 
of some paddock contiguous to the farm buildings, its large leaves 
being used for wrapping round pounded butter to keep it cool.
Oxyria reniformis : grows on Striding Edge, near the Red Tarn, 
and also among rocks by the ravine that descends from Kirkstone 
Pass, towards Brothers Water.
Several species of Polygonum are 
of common occurrence ; among others P.
historta, " Eastermer 
Giant," the leaves of which are used as an ingredient in herb- 
puddings.
AsARACE.E. This family is represented by Asarum europceum, 
which, on the authority of the Rev. W.
Richardson, grew on 
Rampskil or Rampsgill, one of the High Street range, at the head 
of Martindale.
This station I have never been able to examine.
Empetrace,^.
Empetrum nigrum : Lingberry of our dalesmen, 
10 
U6 
is prevalent on most moory ground ; especially abundant on the 
Mali Fells.
EuPHORBiACEiE.
Euphorbia helioscopia, vulgo "Wart Gers," so 
called because its acrid yellow juice is believed to be effective in 
removing warts from the hands.
This, as well as H.
peplus, has 
become almost extinct with the abandonment of tillage ; and both 
are now seldom seen except as garden weeds.
Urticace^.
Urtica dioica : on rubbish heaps and cultivated 
ground almost everywhere.
U. uretis : about Thackthwaite and 
Sparket Mill, in Watermillock ; near Pooley Bridge, &c.
Humulus 
lupulus, the Hop. Wherever this traihng shrub occurs, it has 
clearly been introduced.
At the old mansion house of Water- 
millock fine examples may be seen.
Of the two British species 
of Elm, splendid types occur in the park at Dalemain.
Of the Amentifer^, fine specimens of the Oak are met with at 
Gowbarrow ; and many, I have no doubt, will remember the pair 
of grand Chestnut trees that grace the bank of the Eamont a little 
above Dalemain.
The Hazel, the Birch, and the Alder all are too 
familiar to require comment.
Myrica gale : grows in a meadow 
at Hurrock Wood.
Populus tremula : grows plentifully near 
Soulby.
Of the Willows, Salix pentandra is found pretty generally 
distributed over the district, both male and female specimens being 
met with, the former preponderating.
S. fragilis : some huge 
members of this family may be seen between Dacre Castle and 
Dalemain, mostly I believe females.
It is characteristic of this 
tree that the branches spring from the trunk in a peculiarly irregular 
twisted fashion.
S. alba : fine trees of this species near Baldhow.
Salix triandra : by the River Eamont.
& purpurea : by Goldrill 
Beck, near its mouth ; by the boat-shed near Skelly Neb, &c.
S. viminalis : by Thackthwaite Beck, in Watermillock.
S. acuminata : 
by no means common, and never attaining the size which it reaches 
in the lower parts of the county.
I do not remember ever meeting 
with male catkins of this species.
S. cinerea : the most abundant 
species in the district.
Trees often dwarfed and bushy, especially 
on the shores of the lake.
Often found in moist woods and hedge- 
147 
rows.
S. amita : frequent, though hardly so ubiquitous as the 
preceding.
In a meadow near Sparket Mill.
S. caprea : in dry 
woods and hedges.
Usually the first of the family to put forth 
male catkins.
S. nigricans : appears mostly in hedgerows, or by 
the edges of a rivulet.
Widely distributed, but nowhere abounding 
in the district.
Of this species as many as ten varieties are 
reckoned.
S. repens : a dwarf species, prostrate in habit, seldom 
more than a few inches in height ; an occupant generally of moist 
heaths and commons, with small oblong or lanceolate leaves.
In 
many of our elevated boggy meadows plentiful.
Eight varieties 
are reckoned.
S. herbacea : I give this rare willow a place here 
for the following reason.
Many years ago, when acting as guide 
to a party bound for High Street, we stumbled upon a patch of 
ground covered with these little willows, somewhere in the vicinity 
of Kidsty Pike, where I have vainly sought for it during the 
last two or three seasons.
I yet trust to find it on some of the 
High Street group of hills.
Conifers.
Pinus sylvestris, needs no comment here.
Juniperus 
eommunis: On Birk Fell; St. Sunday Crag; near Greenside 
Mines.
Abundant.
Taxas baccata: must be familiar to all.
From the frequency with which seedling yews are met with on the 
hills that embosom the Lake, it would appear that the tree is 
thoroughly indigenous there, and was at one period probably more 
plentiful than it is now.
A fine example may be seen in Patterdale 
churchyard ; another at Old Church, where the place of worship 
of Watermillock people stood in the time of the Plantagenets, or 
until it was dismantled by the Scots towards the close of the 14th 
century.
TvPHACEiE.
Two species of Sparganium^ Bur-reed, may be 
seen growing side by side m a slow-running ditch in a meadow 
between Howtown and the Lake; these are S.
ramosum and 
5. simplex ; and though I have not seen the smaller S.
minimum 
anywhere growing, it may probably exist in Bannerdale Bottoms, 
or in the boggy meadows round the head of Brothers Water.
Arace^.
Arum^ maculatxim ; conspicuous in hedgerows and 
148 
coppices in early spring, before the curious spathe which encloses 
the fructification appears, to be in turn succeeded by a cluster of 
beautiful red berries.
Note here that these berries — attractive as 
they are to children — are extremely dangerous.
The whole plant 
is decidedly acrid and nauseous ; the juice even in small quantities 
causes a disagreeable and burning sensation when allowed to come 
in contact with the tongue or palate.
Lemnace^.
The Duckweed order.
Lemna tninor is certainly 
not uncommon, and L.
trisulca, the ivy-leaved species, is reported 
as occurring in two or three stagnant pools in the Patterdale 
portion of the district.
NAiADACEiE.
In these it might be inferred that our neighbour- 
hood must be extremely rich.
This is far from being the case.
Potamogeton nutans : in still water by the edges of the Lake ; in 
pools, springs, and brooklets on the hills to a considerable elevation.
P. heterophyllus, P.
perfoliatus, and P.
crispus, also occur, frequently 
forming a sort of vegetable fringe around the edges of the Lake, 
between shallow and deep water.
Zannichellia palustris : many 
years ago, I observed this plant growing in the bed of Goldrill 
Beck, close to the Lake.
It is possibly still in existence there ; 
but last year when I sought to verify the old habitat, I found the 
place unapproachable by a pedestrian, owing to the flooded 
condition of the stream.
Alismace/E.
Trigloclin palustre : in boggy meadows, frequent.
Aiisma plariiago: in pools and ditches about Brothers Water, &c.
A. ranuticuloides : on the authority of Hutchinson, said to grow in 
Patterdale.
The swamp at the head of Brothers Water, frequently 
referred to, and which I have only partially explored, is a very 
likely locality indeed.
The long white fibrous roots of this species 
sometimes penetrate the soft peat bog to a surprising depth.
ORCHiDACEiE.
Orchis mascuia: common mme^ido'fi?,.
O.macu- 
lata, O.
latifolia, Gymnadenia conopsea, Hahenaria viridis, and 
H. bifolia, inhabit the upland meadows in numbers more or less 
considerable.
Of these H.
viridis is the rarest.
Lisiera ovata 
and Epipactis latifolia are also found.
149 
Iridace^.
This order has only one representative here, the 
Iris pseudacorus.
The long sword-shaped leaves, and yellow- 
fleur-de-lis like flowers are known I fancy to every river side 
rambler.
Amaryllidace-s.
Includes two of the earliest spring flowers, 
the Daffodil and the Snowdrop.
The former plant, Narcissus- 
pseudo-narcissus grows profusely by the shore of the Lake fn 
Glencoin Park, just within the limits of Cumberland.
I have 
never seen it in such abundance as here, where it is unquestionably 
indigenous.
The Snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, used at one time 
to grow in patches, at rare intervals, along the shore.
It is now 
all but extinct.
Trilliace/E.
Has only one British type, Paris qiiadrifolia.
This remarkable-looking plant grows in the wood between Roehead 
and Celleron farms in High Barton, but more plentifully in the 
Stainton wood at Dalemain.
LiLiACE^.
Of this handsome order, three or four species 
appear within the hmits of the district, but all of them introduced.
Ruscus aculeatus, in front of the Mansion House, Watermillock ; • 
Fritillaria meleagris, on the shore of the Lake at Old Church ; and 
Lilium martagon, between the mill-race and the river at Dalemain 
Mill.
Allium arenarium grows on House Holme island in the 
Lake, where it has long been stationed.
I do not know with 
which species in the London Catalogue this plant is synonymous; 
probably A.
scorodoprasiim.
The only other garlic common 
amongst us is A.
ursinum : " Ramps," of which cattle appear to 
be uncommonly fond.
Narthecium ossifraguvi : is abundant in 
most turfy bogs.
JuNCACE^.
About half of the twenty-two species recognised as 
British may be regarded as indigenous here.
Of these the most 
noteworthy is the diminutive /uncus triglumis, which grows in 
some of the little streams that have their origin at the foot of 
Helvellyn, just above the head of the Red Tarn.
/. effusus, of 
the stems of which, less than fifty years ago, rushlights were com- 
150 
monly enough made.
J. acutiflorus: is the "Closs" of our dales- 
men, and is often too conspicuous in meadows insufficiently 
drained.
J. squarrosus : is abundant on all moorlands.
Cyperaceve.
Of the Club-Rushes proper only two may require 
special mention here.
The one is Scirpus setaceus : a frequent 
occupant of roadside ditches, often springing up where water- 
cburses have been newly cleaned out.
Round the base of Easter 
Mell Fell it is abundant.
The other is ^.
sylvaticus, by Dacre 
beck, below Thackthwaite.
Of the Cotton Grasses, Eriophorum 
vaginatum and E.
angustifolium are both abundant.
Of the 
Carices or Sedges proper, as many as twenty-five species, 
exclusive of varieties, are indigenous here.
I may here briefly 
particularise a few of the most remarkable.
Carex dioica: is 
far from uncommon in deep spongy bogs.
In " Jamie Gersin," 
on the Cove estate in Watermillock, it grows in fair abundance, 
though less plentiful than C.pulicaris.
C. muricata: near Waterfoot, 
also in the woods near Airey Force, appearing sparingly ; while its 
congener, C.
siellulata, is everywhere abundant.
C. curta: in 
Black Dyke, Baldhow.
C. acuta: is also found at the same 
station as the preceding, to which, however, it is not confined, 
appearing in a field below Bennet Head and elsewhere.
C. pilu- 
lifera: is found on the Watermillock stinted pasture, and also about 
the base of Catchidecam and Striding-Edge.
C. hirta : occurs at 
the lower end of the Lake, below the Waterfoot boat-shed ; and 
C. ampullacea is of common occurrence in slow-running streams or 
in stagnant water, notably about the foot of Brothers Water.
The Gramin/e, or Grasses, stand next in order in the Catalogue.
but as I have already treated upon them in detail in Part VI., I 
shall pass them over without comment, noticing however that 
specimens of Poa alpina have since been forwarded to me which 
were gathered on Skiddaw last year ; and that I have Ukewise seen 
P. nemoralis on the retaining walls of the road-cutting at Kempley, 
near Eamont Bridge, and Festuca sylvatica — fine specimens — in 
the rocky ravine near Greenside Mines.
151 
FILICES.
Of the Filices or Ferns of the district, I will now proceed briefly 
to enumerate the different species.
The first plant in the Catalogue 
of Ferns undoubtedly indigenous here is perhaps the most diminu- 
tive native species, Hymenophyllum nnilaterale.
During the last 
two seasons I have found this little fern > much more widely 
distributed in the recesses of our deepest mountain ravines, than I 
had previously believed.
On shady wet rocks it forms a curiously 
matted covering, growing in many instances horizontally or even in 
an inverted position, and so like moss that I have gathered it by 
mistake more than once.
Pteris aquilina : abundantly distributed 
in the district ; varying from six inches to as many feet in height, 
according to circumstances.
Where it attains the largest size, as 
in some parts of the deer-park at Gowbarrow, it is seldom found 
to perfect its fructification : the fronds being without sori.
Large 
quantities of brackens are cut down in the autumn and used for 
bedding.
Cryptogramma crispa: grows profusely on the ledges 
and in the clefts of rocks of the trap and slate formations through- 
out the district.
About old stone walls it is also abundant.
When 
removed from its native haunts, I believe it is found somewhat 
difficult of cultivation, not readily accommodating itself to change 
of locality or climatic influences.
Lomaria spicant : in crevices of 
moist rocky places, not unfrequent, Asplenium ruta-tnuraria : 
abundant in fissures of the rocks, especially about the top of 
Moordivock.
A. septentrionale : in the summer of 1879 I found a 
solitary specimen of this rare fern growing in the crevices of the 
rocks near Red Tarn; in 1880 it had disappeared.
A.trichomanes: 
abundantly distributed about crevices of shaded rocks, walls of 
ancient structure, &c., generally selecting a northern aspect, or at 
least a position not exposed to the sun.
A. viride : is still present 
with us in two or three stations, which I cannot venture to make 
public, from considerations which I trust the members of our 
Association will correctly appreciate.
A, adiantum-nigrutn: widely 
distributed, though nowhere occurring in large numbers.
On rocks, 
old walls, quarry banks, and by shaded hedgerows.
Athyriiim 
I.-) 2 
filix-fce7niiia: in moist shady situations, which appear to be 
essential to its full development, this fern is fairly abundant.
I 
have frequently noticed specimens in which the central fronds 
stood upright to the height of four feet or upwards, the outer ones 
drooping in every direction around them.
Mr. Lowe of Notting- 
ham, the famous writer on ferns, enumerates over two hundred 
varieties of Lady-ferrt I must rest content with mentioning the 
fact that the variety known as rhmticiim, with reddish-brown rachis 
and fronds, is not unfrequent.
Ceterach officinamm : old botanical 
lists inform us that this fern gcew about Yew Crag, and on the 
rocks near Airey Force ; and I myself recollect seeing it on Priest 
Crag some thirty-five years ago.
I h^e failed to find it until quite 
recently in any of these stations.
Scolopendrium vulgare: this fern 
is comparatively rare in the district, and nowhere approaches the' 
dimensions of plants of the same species met with in West Cum- 
berland, where it is plentiful.
Cystopteris fragilis : is widely 
distributed over the district, In moist shady places, and in the 
crevices of rocks.
The var.
dentata, by some authorities ^considered: 
a distinct species, has occasionally been found.
Aspidium lonchitis : 
this uncommonly rare species has been reported as occurring in 
several stations.
The Rev. W.
H. Hawker, as Sowerby informs 
us, found it about thirty years ago on Swarth Fell.
Specimens 
have also been found on Striding Edge, Cawdale Moor, and Place 
Fell.
I have not seen it in a growing state.
A. aculeatum : on 
the borders of woods and thickets, and sometimes in bosky ravines 
on the hills, this fern is not unfrequent.
Three varieties are 
reckoned, but all the specimens I have seen within the district 
may be classed as belonging to this type.
Fine examples occur 
near Sparket Mill.
Nephrodium filix-7nas : after Fferis aquilina,^ 
the most common species inhabiting our woods and hedgerows in 
the valleys, and luxuriating in almost every variety of soil.
This 
is the "Meckin" of the dalesmen.
The var.
{c) borreri, distinguished 
by having the rachis clothed with ruddy golden scales, is not 
unfrequent.
N. dilatatum: more familiarly known perhaps as 
Lastrea dilatata, a large and well-known species plentifully , 
distributed, but nowhere so abundant as the last mention edj 
153 
Usually in shady situations.
Lastrea theiypieris : a local and very 
rare species, an inhabitant of spongy bogs.
Said in old lists to 
occur in Glencoin, also at Blawick.
At the former station I have 
been unable to discover it ; the latter I have never examined.
L. oreopteris : a native of upland heaths and woods, of general 
occurrence in the Lake district.
Polypodium vulgare: common 
about the roots and moss-grown trunks of trees, on old walls, rooft 
of out-buildings, etc.
F. phegopteris : commonly known as Beech 
fern ; not uncommon in moist woods and shady spots.
P. dryopteris : 
a frequent dweller in dry stony woods in the mountain districts/ 
Osmunda regalis : of the existence of this fern within the district, I 
have only casually and quite recently heard, and until I can have 
complete assurance of the fact, I must forbear any further reference 
to it.
Ophioglossum vulgatum : by way of contrast to my remarks 
on the Royal fern, I may state that I have recently found the 
Adder's Tongue in far greater abundance than I had any previous 
idea of It abounds in many of our mountain meadows and 
pastures, especially where moisture prevails.
Botrychium luiiaria: 
frequently found in the same localities with the preceding, though 
far less abundant.
Examples occur on Gowbarrow Fells, and on 
the Watermillock stinted pasture.
Lycopodiaceje.
Of the six British species, four may be set 
down as of common occurrence here.
The two most frequently 
met with are Lycopodium davatum, " Stagshorn, or Fox's tail ; " 
and Selagitiella selaginoides : the most diminutive member of the 
family.
Isoetes lacustris : is mentioned by Hutchinson as an 
occupant of the lower end of Ullswater, and also of Gowbarrow 
Wyke.
I hope to find it some day.
Equisetace^.
Of the eight species belonging to this order, 
four are indigenous here.
These are Equisetum arvense, E.
sylvati- 
cum, abundant and often very fine ; E.
palustre, rather scarce ; 
and E.
limosum, which is abundant in Brothers Water, and on the 
banks of the Eamont, near Pooley Bridge.
154 
CHARACE^.
Of the first of the two genera representing this order here, Chara 
and Nitella, I have been fortunate enough to discover a very rare 
species, heretofore unknown in Cumberland, in Chara polyacantha, 
which I found in Newton Moss at the beginning of August, 1882.
One species, now I believe designated Nitella opaca, is of frequent 
occurrence in Ullswater.
It grows in sheltered bays, where it 
roots among sand or gravel.
Other species ought to be found in 
upland pools and tarns.
They are all aquatic, submersed plants.

TITLE ONLY.
OUR NORTHERN MOSSES.
By FREDERICK HARRISON.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
(abstract.) 
The author, after giving a general description of the Class Musci, the 
geographical distribution of Mosses, their mode of occurrence, and the part 
they exercise in the economy of Nature, proceeds to describe the particular 
species that, by their perennial growth and decay, contribute to the formation 
^of peat-moss.
Amongst the [conditions essential to the growth and development of peat- 
mosses are a comparatively low mean temperature, and the presence of mo.-e 
I or less moisture in the soil where the peat-forming plants are growing.
Owing 
to these reasons, peat -mosses are rare or absent in hot regions, and they become 
more abundant, and yield peat of a more inflammable nature, as we advance 
towards the colder regions of the globe.
The author has noticed a connection between the occurrence of peat-mosses 
and that of surface deposits of boulder clay, which, being generally of a more 
or less impervious nature, have held up the surface water, and so have given 
rise to the formation of peat-bogs.
The author goes on to say : — 
I CAN point to several examples in our own district where the peat 
has formed itself upon the boulder clay in this manner.
At the Little 
Moss, near Houghton, which is now under cultivation, the peat 
lies in a depression in the boulder clay— a situation very favour- 
156 
able to its growth.
Of course, since this peat-moss was drained, 
some years ago, its growth has ceased.
The same occurs wherever 
draining has been carried on to any extent.
As soon as the 
moisture is drawn off, the growth of the peat-moss ceases, and the 
bulk or depth begins to decrease rapidly.
Another local case of great interest occurs on what is known as 
Bowness Flow.
The formation of peat moss there is of very great 
depth, and contains a large body of water, as the Solway Junction 
Railway Co. found out to their cost, when they made their line of 
railway over it.
Yet close at hand, surrounded on every side by 
the treacherous moss, there is a farm-house standing high and dry 
on a hill, rising like a cone out of the moss.
This high ground is 
the Glacial Drift of the district, and the moss around no doubt 
lies on a bed of the same, but at a lower level.
Buried trees are 
of common occurrence in peat-mosses.
They have been found 
with their trunks standing erect and their roots fixed in the subsoil, 
clearly showing that they have grown on the very spot where 
found.
It is mentioned in Sir Charles Lyell's "Principles of 
Geology," that in the Isle of Man vast trees have been discovered 
standing firm on their roots, although covered by peat moss to a 
depth of eighteen or twenty feet.
It has also been observed in 
Scotland, by Walker and others, that trees found in riiosses which 
lie in low regions are larger than those found in mosses at a 
higher , level — from whicli it has been inferred that the trees grew 
on the spot, as they would naturally attain their greatest size at 
lower and warmer levels.
The leaves and fruits are commonly found imbedded in the 
peatmoss along with the parent trees; for example, the leaves 
and the acorns of the oak.
These changes from a forest of trees 
to a peat-moss have been often brought about by trees falling, and 
causing a stagnation of water, and thereby favouring the growth 
and decay of the plants already referred to.
Many of the great peat-mosses of this county date at least as far 
back on the Neolithic Period, as is evidenced by the oecurrence of 
stone implements in them; one such, now preserved in the British 
Museum,, being founds in.
th$ pieat-miosd at Bbw^ess.
Yet, Although ' 
157 
fheJiigK antiquity of many of our peat-moss^ is beyond a doubts it 
is equally certain that others now occupy large tracts of country in 
these islands where there were none at, all when the Romans first 
set foot here.
As an instance may be mentioned Hatfield Moss, 
in Yorkshire, which appears to have been a forest eighteen hundred 
years ago.
Roman roads have been discovered buried beneath a 
depth of ten or twelve feet of peat ; showing that the peat has 
formed to this depth since the Roman Period.
The overthrow of a forest of Scotch firs in Ross-shire, by a 
storm, in the ryth century, may be said to have furnished one of 
the best modern examples of the rate of formation of a peat-moss.
It is said that in less than half a century from the date of the 
storm, the inhabitants dug peat on the site of the forest.
In that 
case the growth, no doubt, was exceptionally rapid, on account of 
all the circumstances being unusually favourable.' The water that 
has stagnated in contact with peat contains in solution, according 
to Liebig, a substance that possesses the power of absorbing 
oxygen from everything with which it comes in contact; this may 
be one of the causes of the barrenness of peat-mosses.
On the 
removal of the stagnant water by drainage the air obtains admission 
into the soil, and such portions of vegetable matter as are still 
capable of further decay are enabled to undergo more complete 
decomposition, and thus the agricultural quality of the soil begins 
at once to improve.
At the bottom of mosses there is sometimes found a cake, or 
pan, of Hydrous Peroxide of Iron, or Bog Iron Ore. The bog-oak 
so often found dyed black in peat-mosses owes its colour chiefly to 
the action of this mineral upon the tannin.
The wonderful anti- 
septic properties of peat may be partly owing to the presence of 
this Oxide of Iron as well as to that of the tannin.
Oak timber is often found in peat-mosses in a condition so 
perfect, even after having been buried for centuries, that the grain 
is as fine as ever, and the wood is capable of lasting longer even 
than wood newly cut from the forest.
We have some beautiful examples of bog-oak in this neighbour- 
158 
hood.
Some of the timber used in building the church at Wreay, 
and also that employed in the consti action of the singular-looking 
pulpit there, was made out of wood dug out of Wragmire Moss.
This Moss, and therefore, the trees therein imbedded, is shewn to 
have been pre-roman in date by the discovery of a massive 
(Roman) framework of wood underlying the present road across 
the Moss.
I cannot conclude without referring to the famous outburst of 
the Solway Moss in this county described by Gilpin, and again 
referred to by Mr. Holmes in Part VI.
of our Transactions, which 
occurred on the night of the i6th December, 1772.
That scene 
of desolation has now been brought under cultivation once more ; 
but if that mass of peat had been allowed to remain after the 
outburst, what are now the fine grazing parks of Netherby might 
have been to-day little else than a barren peat-moss.
That all mosses are capable of being brought under cultivation, 
there is no doubt.
But of that aspect of the subject I propose to 
treat on some future occasion.

ON THE GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE 
OF THE FORMER EXTENSION OF COAL MEASURES 
OVER EDENSIDE.
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, of the Geological Survey of England.
(Communicated at the Carlisle Annual Meeting, by permission of 
the Director General of the Geological Survey.) 
In 1870, after having been engaged for several years in elaborating 
the Geological Survey of the Carboniferous rocks around the head 
waters of the Eden, Lune, Yore, Swale, Rawtha, Dee, and Clough, 
that portion of the Survey was so far completed that the work 
began to be pushed northward in the direction of the Westmorland 
boundary in the neighbourhood of Stainmoor, preparatory to 
attacking the complicated piece of geology extending thence along 
the foot of the Black Fell sides past Murton, Dufton, Knock, 
Milburn, Kirkland and Melmerby, to Renwick.
The highly detailed character of the observations my official 
duties had required me to make, had already enabled me to obtain 
an intimate acquaintance with the characteristics of each individual 
member of the Carboniferous series occurring within the area 
referred to — a kind of knowledge that was absolutely necessary for 
anyone to possess that was about to undertake the unravelling of 
the complicated tract that was to be examined next.
The part of the district about to be especially referred to in 
164 
this communication, is that upper part of Edenside lying to the 
east of a line joining Kirkby Stephen and Brough, and nearly 
included within the limits of the Six-inch maps 17 and 24 of the 
Ordnance- and of the Geological Survey of Westmorland.
The detailed description of this extremely complicated district 
will, of course, be reserved for the official memoir in preparation ; 
but as there are several structural peculiarities found there that are 
imperfectly understood even yet by many professional geologists, 
and as it is only by a thorough comprehension of the nature of these 
structural characteristics that the subject to be presently referred 
to can be correctly understood, I venture to preface the remarks 
that, with the permission of the Director General of the Geological 
Survey, I am allowed to lay before the Cumberland Association in 
this paper, with such an exposition of the more complex of these 
phenomena as may serve the twofold purpose of leading up to the 
more technical description to be given in the Survey Memoir, and 
of rendering the principal subject of the present communication 
more intelligible to the general reader.
The district in question is traversed by a portion of the great 
and complex series of derangements of strata that are referred to 
collectively under the name of the Pennine Fault.
This, as has 
long been known, traverses the rock.'; over a large area in the 
North-west of England as an irregular line, or narrow zone, whose 
general course, seen in plan, may be described as resembling the 
outline of the letter 2- The lower limb of the Z corresponds in 
a general way with what is known as the Craven Fault.
This, in 
the neighbourhood of Ingleton and Kirkby Lonsdale sends off two 
important branches towards the North-east, represented by the 
middle portion of the letter.
The general character of these was 
described many years ago in the Explanation of Quarter Sheet 
98SE of the Geological Survey.
Of these two faults, the one we 
are at present most concerned with is the fault described as ranging 
past Barbon Fell, Dent, Sedbergh, Cautla, Clouds, and across the 
Eden at Mallerstang Foot to Nateby and Harcla.
Along this part 
of its course it has been called the Dent- Kirkby Stephen Fault, 
and it has been shewn by Sedgwick and others to produce a net 
165 
result of a downthrow on the south-east side, or on the right hand 
side of the letter, if the upper limb be regarded as representing the 
north of the map.
For the correct understanding of what is to follow, it will be 
necessary to obtain a general idea of the lie of the rocks that occur 
on each side of the zone of disturbances now referred to.
The 
phenomena are complicated, and somewhat difficult to explain to 
the non -geological reader ; but some insight into the nature of the 
changes that take place may be gathered by means of one or two 
simple experiments, if the reader have the faculty of mentally 
extending an idea formed in the first instance from an examination 
of objects on a small scale to the phenomena in the field on a 
scale large enough to extend over a line twenty or twenty-five 
miles in length.
All, or nearly all, except the volcanic strata of our district, were 
originally deposited in beds that were nearly or quite horizontal ; 
so that their normal position, where they are undisturbed, is that 
of great piles of sheets of sandstone, shale, limestone, and so on, 
piled one over another up to an aggregate thickness, that ranges 
from a few hundred feet to as many thousands, and may, in the 
case of one or two groups, really be stated in miles.
Now a 
moment's reflection will convince any one that, if these strata all 
lay in the horizontal position natural to them when they were first 
formed, we should have very little opportunity of learning anything 
of the nature of the strata that lay near the bottom, unless we had 
valleys deep enough to cut through the pile from the top to the very 
bottom, and that would mean that we should have either valleys 
six or seven miles in depth (as the total thickness of the existing 
strata of Cumberland and Westmorland is not far short of that) or 
else, putting the same statement in another form, we should have 
mountains towering to an elevation of as many miles above the 
level of the lowest part of the surface.
As a matter of fact we 
know that this is not the case, and the exposure of the great thick- 
nesses of rock that are now out to the day in one part or another 
of the district have, clearly, resulted from the action of subsequent 
causes that have affected the lie of the strata, and disturbed them 
166 
in such a manner as to bring up the ends of a great thickness of 
beds of rock to the same general level at the surface.
Accordingly, confining our attention for the present to the strata 
newer than the Silurian rocks, we find that, while the vast pile of 
Carboniferous rocks that the wild upland tract extending from the 
eastern boundary of Edenside into Yorkshire has been shaped out 
of yet retain much of their originally-horizontal position, there are 
other tracts of the same rocks, lying side by side with these hori- 
zontal strata, and now forming much of the low ground of Edenside, 
that are tilted in such a manner as to bring the edges of a very 
considerable thickness of rocks to the surface within a distance of 
only a few miles.
Some idea of the relation of these tilted strata to the beds that 
are less disturbed may be gathered by laying half a quire or so of 
sheets of stififish paper of various colours, or an old copy-book, on 
its side, and making a clean cut right through from about the 
middle nearly to the outer edge.
If it now be pressed endways in 
the direction of the incision, it will be easy to force the paper on 
one side of the cut to arch in an upward curve while that on the 
other bends in the opposite direction ; the papers at each end of 
the cut remaining all the while in their original position.
It will 
then be easy to see how any individual sheet is opposed, on one 
side of the incision, first, by the corresponding part of the same 
sheet on the other side, and then by successively higher, or lower, 
sheets, as the case may be, up to the point of greatest curvature.
Beyond that point it will be noticed that the vertical distance 
between the positions of the same sheet on each side of the cut 
gradually lessens, until, at the farther extremity each sheet on one 
side of the line is again level with its corresponding part on the 
other.
Imagine the pile of sheets ot paper to represent a great 
series of deposits accumulated from beginning to end without any 
important breaks in the succession ; the surface of the copy book, 
an area of a few hundred square miles ; the incision, a line of 
weakness where the rocks have given way over a still older line of 
fracture in the rocks underlying the strata represented by the 
sheets of paper ; and, finally, the action of the bands in bending 
167 
the paper into folds further to represent the net result of a complex 
series of thrusts and strains affecting the rocks when they were 
much nearer the centre of the earth than at present — and there is 
an illustration of the nature and origin of faults in general, and 
especially of the particular faults whose effects I am about to 
describe.
But it often happens that two or more faults may join at various 
angles, and thus give rise to a line of fracture that is by no means 
straight in its course.
This further complication may be unravelled 
by an extension of the last experiment.
Run the cut out to the 
edge of the copy-book at its lower margin, and continue the cut at 
the other end a few inches off to the left, at rather less than a 
right angle to the line of the original cut ; the incisions will then 
represent the middle and upper limbs of the Z.
Press the paper 
on the left hand in the direction of the cut, as before, and in such 
a way that the part lying to the right hand may this time remain 
quite flat, while that on the left of the cut is bent into an upward 
curve, arching above the general level of the paper at the point of 
greatest curvature, and, at the inner angle of the incision, bent 
down at the comer in such a way as to be depressed beneath it.
There will then be three points where any given sheet of paper will 
be edge to edge with other portions of the same sheet, (that is to 
say where there is no dislocation in a vertical direction,) and there 
will be two points where the dislocation will be at its maximum.
If the separate sheets are coloured, or better still, are lettered 
consecutively from a\o z, a on the left of the cut will be opposed 
to a on the right; then as the paper arches upward on one side 
while it remains fiat on the other, a point is presently reached 
where z at the bottom, on the left, is opposed to a on the right.
We will call that a downthrow on the right hand.
Then, as the 
upward curve gives place to a curve in the opposite direction, y, x, 
w, V, and so on, come in succession edge to edge with a, until 
presently the point is reached where a and a are again together.
That is to say, at that point the vertical displacement is reduced to 
nit.
But the downward inclination being continued beyond that 
point, the result is that a on the left of the incision is depressed 
168 
below b, c, dy e, and so on (in succession), on the right of the line 
until, at the point of maximum depression, in the angle where the 
upper limb of the Z goes off from the middle limb, a on the left, is 
opposed to say w, x, or y on the other.
We will call that a down- 
throw on the left hand.
From that point, in the direction of the 
left hand extremity of the upper limb of the Z the displacement 
diminishes, as before, and finally comes once more to nothing at 
all, at the end of the incision.
It is worth while to take a little trouble in order to comprehend 
the phenomena I have endeavoured to illustrate by this, itself 
somewhat-complicated experiment, because a distinct conception 
of the structural character it is intended to elucidate, really affords 
the key to the structure of one of the most important features in 
the geology of the North of England, and it enables one, in 
addition, to gain a better insight into the true nature of faults in 
general than can very well be obtained by other means.
And one 
result of the imperfect conception of the true nature of what 
people call " The Pennine Fault," has been that no correct general 
description of it has yet been given.
Yet the very existence of the 
remnant of Coal Measure strata about to be referred to is owing 
to one of the complex series of changes of throw, whose nature I 
have just endeavoured to describe.
A reference now to the annexed stereographic diagram will help 
still further to explain these complex relations.
This represents 
in a highly generalized diagrammatic form the same phenomena 
that I have endeavoured to bring before the mind by means of the 
•experiments just described.
In this figure the two planes meeting 
at right angles on the left, and separating the quadrangular blocks 
from the continuous portion, are supposed to coincide with the 
planes of the faults represented in place by the middle and the 
upper Umbs respectively of the Z.
The surface of the continuous 
part represents, in like manner, the Carboniferous uplands on the 
outer side of the Faults, while the plane represented by the inclined 
upper surface of the several detached blocks shews the general 
shape of the lower surface presented by the outcrops of the rocks 
on the inner, or western, side of the faults.
iw 
Explanation of the Figure.
The annexed stereogiaphic diagram is in- 
tended to illustrate the general nature of the 
Pennine Fault, with especial reference to the 
mode of occurrence of the remnant of Coal 
Measures faulted in at the foot of Stainmoor.
The two vertical planes meeting in the angle 
above (5) and separating the continuous portion 
from the detached sections, represent the western 
aspect of the Fault as if exposed to view by the 
removal of portions of the country extending 
along its western side.
The general level of 
the great upland tract at the head of Edenside 
is represented by the upper surface of the con- 
tinuous part ; while the faulted (?pre-cretaceous) 
plain of marine denudation extending across the 
New Red forming the lower ground of that 
part, and gradually rising as it cuts across the 
edges of all the older strata until it reaches the 
summit of the Howgill Fells, is denoted by the 
inclined plane forming the upper limit of the 
five blocks.
The projection at (1) shews the relation of the 
base of the Mountain Limestone A to the con- 
torted Silurian strata at Cautlaand Ressondaleon 
the west side of the Fault, as well as to the equiv- 
alent geological horizon concealed beneath the 
newer rocks on the downcast, or east, side of 
the same line of dislocation.
(2) Represents the same horizons at one level, 
near Harcla.
(3) East of Kaber, shows the Yoredale Rocks 
B, and then the Millstone Grit C on the west 
curving downwards past A on the east of the 
Fault.
(4) Near Barras, illustrates the occurrence of 
still higher strata in vertical contact with A.
(5) Represents in a generalized manner the 
stratigraphical relations of the Coal Measures 
D in the neighbourhood of Argill.
The dotted stratum marked K denotes the 
New Red, which is she\vn overstepping* the 
denuded edges of the older rocks, from the 
highest of the Carboniferous down well nigh to 
the base.
The figure also shews the three plains that 
constitute the broader features of the district ; 
these are of Pre-Carboniferous, Post-Carbon- 
iferous, and (?) Pre-Cretaceous age respectively.
The extent ol the faulting and disturbance each 
has undergone prior to its re-exposure by the 
removal of newer strata is also indicated in a 
diagrammatic form in the same figure.
* It would be well to make some distinction between 
such a case as this, where K is in unconformable contact 
with various older strata, and that of true Overlap, 
where the higher members of a continuous series of 
deposits locally occupy lower horizons through the 
attenuation of the older members of the same series.
We might, also, make use of the correlatives Vnderstep, 
and Underlap, with advantage to geological nomen- 
clature in cases of this nature.
170 
A little study of the figure will, I think, make the following points 
clear, i.
That the Carboniferous strata were deposited in the form of 
a great series of alternating sheets of various kinds of sediment, whose 
aggregate thickness must have originally amounted to at least two 
miles.
2. That these Carboniferous rocks consist, in ascending order 
of — i.
The Basement Beds, not separately shewn ; ii.
The Moun- 
tain Limestone A ; iii.
The Yoredale Rocks B ; iv.
The Millstone 
Grit C ; and, v.
The Coal Measures D.
3. That this great pile of 
marine accumulations has been originally distributed over a very 
large extent of country consisting of older rocks whose surface only 
accidentally bore anything more than the remotest relation to the 
original surface of deposition.
4. That after these Carboniferous 
rocks had been deposited, and before the commencement of the 
next period we have any local evidence of, they were, in their turn, 
very much disturbed and folded, and the continuity of the original 
sheets of rock interrupted by great lines of fracture.
5. That they 
were then exposed for untold geological periods to the action of 
various denudants, which gradually stripped off thousands of feet 
of rock from some parts, with the result of completely severing the 
continuity of the once-extensive deposits.
6. That on the remnants 
of these strata accidentally preserved from denudation were suc- 
cessively piled up several other great series of accumulations, 
which, in their turn, were also deranged and denuded like the 
older strata.
And, finally, that the ultimate outcome of this 
complex series of changes has been the present form of the surface, 
variously shaped out of all the older parts of the Neozoic, and the 
newer portions of the Pateozoic series of rocks.
If I have succeeded thus far in imparting a general idea of the 
nature and origin of the complicated phenomena that characterise 
this part of the district, the reader will now be prepared to under- 
stand the brief description of the actual lie of the rocks that 
follows.
It is in the comparatively low ground in the neighbourhood of 
Harcla, near Kirkby Stephen, that the Pennine Fault changes its 
throw from a net result of a downthrow on the south-east to a net 
result of a downthrow on the side opposite.
On the .east side of 
171 
this zone of dislocation, or on the right-hand side of the Z, the 
fells consist chiefly of Yoredale Rocks with just a capping formed 
by detached remains of Millstone Grit strata left on the summits 
of the higher fells; and with strips and interrupted patches of 
Mountain Limestone turned up endways where this rock underlying 
the Yoredale Series has been exposed to view by the removal of 
the overlying strata along the lower flanks of the fell sides next 
the faults.
These beds are generally much folded and otherwise 
disturbed, or even occasionally turned upside down for short 
distances ; but they right themselves entirely within a short distance 
of the faults, and gradually pass into strata that retain much of 
their original position of horizontality.
Consequently, regarding 
the strata on the outer, or eastern, side of the faults as a whole, 
they may be said to consist of beds so nearly horizontal that almost 
any of the higher members of the series, the Main, or Great Lime- 
stone for example, can usually be found at about the same general 
level above the sea all the way up from near Ingleton to Brough, 
or beyond.
The rocks on the inner, or western side of the faults, represented 
in place by the side to the left of the Z, lie, as a whole, in a very 
different manner.
To the south, at the part represented by the _ 
block at the right hand extremity of the foregoing diagram, the 
great dome-shaped aggregation of rounded eminences forming the 
Howgill Fells is described by Professor Hughes, in the Survey 
Memoir on 98 N.E. as consisting of contorted and highly inclined 
rocks, mostly of Silurian age, whose dips, as shewn in the figure, 
bear not the slightest necessary relation to either the form of the 
surface or to that portion of their surface that slopes beneath and 
is covered up by the Carboniferous strata.
These rocks form ground rising somewhat higher than the base 
of the Millstone Grit of Wilbert Fell in the part of the carboniferous 
tract lying to the east of the Howgill Fells and separated from them 
by the line of the faults ; so that the full extent of the dislocation at 
this point cannot well be less than the vertical distance between the 
general level of the summits of the Howgill Fells themselves and 
the general level of the equivalent strata that form the floor of 
172 
Older Palgeozoic Rocks extending beneath the Millstone Grit, the 
Yoredale Rocks and the Mountain Limestone that Wilbert Fell 
itself consists of; and this must be as much as, if not more than, 
two thousand feet.
That is to say, at that point the Post-Carbon- 
iferous part of the fault there has a downthrow to the east of not 
less than two thousand feet.
Now, as we follow the surface of the Howgill Fell Silurian rocks 
northward to the town of Ravenstonedale, we find the Mountain 
Limestone beginning to come on the edges of the older strata ; 
and, instead of lying at a comparatively low angle, as they are 
known to do on the east side of the Faults, they here come on 
with a high angle of dip.
This dip amounts to an average dip of 
about eight or nine degrees — possibly an average of ten.
As a 
consequence, although the local thickness of the Mountain Lime- 
stone with the beds below it, altogether amounts to between two 
thousand and two thousand five hundred feet at this part, by the 
time we have got as far north as Kirkby Stephen the very top is 
reached.
Now this horizon, as I have more than once before 
remarked, goes on at about the same general level on the other 
side of the line of disturbance.
Consequently, when the top of 
the Mountain Limestone on one side of the fault is brought into 
contact with the top of the Mountain Limestone on the other, 
there is clearly no vertical dislocation, even though the actual 
fissure and the accompanying disturbances remain to attest to the 
existence of the fault itself But the dip to the north continues as 
we traverse the country on the north-west side of the faults in the 
direction of Brough ; so that the Yoredale Rocks, and then the 
Millstone Grit, come down bed after bed into the low ground at 
the foot of Stainmoor, and the throw of the Great Faults, instead 
of being, as at first, down south-easterly, has changed sides, and is 
now rapidly increasing in amount on the north-westerly side.
North of the Bela, in the neighbourhood of Kaber, the faults 
become very complicated, and the downthrown rocks, which are 
very greatly disturbed, begin, as a whole, to dip more and more 
towards the east, and the angle of dip gradually augments from 
that of a few degrees up to one of sixty degrees or more.
This 
173 
may be examined in Hockergill, and Strice Gill, Mousgill, Argill, 
and Augills in the low ground between Brough and Barras.
In 
the lower part of these sections we get the uppermost beds of the 
Yoredale Rocks.
Then, nearer the faults, comes on bed after bed 
of the Millstone Grit, stratigraphically identical with the beds 
occurring on the highest summits of the Carboniferous hills away 
to the south, but here characterised by various shades of red, due 
to the infiltration of ferruginous and other matters that had soaked 
down from the overlying New Red strata before they were denuded 
from this portion of their surface.
Then we get a remnant of beds 
higher still in the series — beds that have been saved from denuda- 
tion perhaps at no point nearer than the Ingleton Coal Field, 
and, like the lower beds, also deeply stained red.
Farther, after 
traversing the outer ends of many hundreds of feet of highly -inclined 
beds of grit, sandstone, shale, comparatively thin beds of fireclay, 
and thin bands of clay-ironstone (occasionally with their carbonate 
of iron exteriorly replaced by the per-oxide of iron filtered down 
from the New Red), we begin to meet with remarkably thick 
beds of fireclay, here and there crowded with most beautiful speci- 
mens of Carboniferous vegetation — numbers of fern-like fragments 
amongst others.
Finally, in following up the section a little further 
we abruptly find ourselves again face to face with the well-known 
alternations of limestones, sandstones, and shales of the Lower 
Carboniferous Series.
We have in fact crossed the Fault, and are 
here standing on rocks that, a few yards farther back, it would have 
required a bore-hole of well nigh on to a viile in depth to reach.
No one seems ever to have suspected the existence of veritable 
Coal Measures anywhere in this neighbourhood ; indeed these very 
sections had been repeatedly examined by some of our best geolo- 
gists, and variously referred to the Ash Fell Beds, to the New Red, 
and to stained Carboniferous rocks of uncertain age.
But the remarkable degree of stratigraphical uniformity pre 
vailing throughout the various scattered outliers of Millstone 
Grit left capping the summits of the fells between this point and 
Ingleton enabled me at once to identify the lower beds as Millstone 
Grit, and enabled me further to identify them bed for bed even 
174 
with certain minor subdivisions whose stratigraphical relations to 
the Coal Measures at Ingleton were prettyjwell known.
It 
followed, of course, that as Coal Measures might be expected to 
occur at a certain distance above a particular known horizon in the 
Millstone Grit in one part, they might be expected under the same 
circumstances in the same relative position also at another.
This 
gave the clue, and, following it up, I searched well for coal seams 
where I felt sure they ought to occur, and there I found them.
Several seams of coal were discovered in this way, and then, as 
the occurrence here of any Carboniferous rocks as high as the Coal 
Measures was a fact of very considerable geological interest, I lost 
no time in communicating the discovery to several of my colleagues.
The coal seams I found myself were of poor quality, and I thought 
very little of the discovery beyond its geological interest, until the 
place began to be systematically explored by the gentleman that 
held the lease of.
the property.
But under the search^so instituted 
the existence of several other and more valuable seams of coal, as 
well as of several remarkably thick deposits of fire-clay, was brought 
to light.
As I wrote a condensed account of these finds in a 
Report* made at that time (1872) for the lessee, on behalf of the 
owner of the property, and furthermore, as the nature of this 
communication does not require that I should enter minutely into 
details, which will be found stated in full in the ofiicial description 
of the district, it will be sufficient to state that, in all, about twenty 
distinct seams of coal were discovered, having an aggregate thick- 
ness of about forty feet.
Eight, or nine, of these seams are not 
less than two feet in thickness, and one runs up to a maximum 
thickness of well on to eight feet at one part.
The total quantity 
available from these eight, or nine, seams may be set down in 
round numbers at about three million tons ; much of the coal 
being above the average quality, and the best of it being equal to 
some of the best coal obtained from the Newcastle Coal-field.
In the above estimate no note has been taken of the various 
seams that are known to occur — because they are worked in the

Museum.
175 
districts adjoining — at lower horizons, and in the Millstone Grit ; 
nor is any note taken of the Boradale seam, so long worked in the 
underlying Yoredale Rocks on Stainmoor.
It is in contemplation, I understand, to make use of the enormous 
quantities of fireclay, or seggar clay, as it is called out Northumber- 
land way, for the manufacture of some descriptions of pottery — a 
use that it is said to be well adapted for.
When that is done we, 
as geologists, shall have a capital opportunity of collecting some of 
the very beautiful plant remains that these rocks are, in places, 
almost crowded with.
The geological interest attaching to this discovery is undoubtedly 
very great, for more reasons than one.
In the first place, the 
existence of beds so high up in the Carboniferous series within a {qw 
miles of a place where the lowest member of the New Red lies on 
beds low down in the Mountain Limestone, points in a manner 
that is unmistakeable to the enormous amount of disturbance and 
subsequent denudation the Carboniferous Rocks here, as elsewhere, 
had undergone before the lowest member of the Neozoic Rocks 
began to be deposited — a thickness of rock implying a chrono- 
logical break nearly as great as that famous unconformity we can 
boast of in Edenside between the Carboniferous strata and the 
rocks of the Lake District.
(In all probability geologists will one 
day fully realise the importance of this great break, and will take 
the base of the Neozoic Series at the base of our New Red, 
instead of at an imaginary line nmning through the middle of that 
series.) 
Another point of importance impressed upon our minds by the 
occurrence of this tiny patch of Coal Measures at the head of our 
valley is the enormous amount of denudation the mountain tract 
that bounds Edenside on the east and the north-east, as well as 
the Lake District area itself, must have undergone.
If the 
equivalents of all the beds observable in the coal area were 
replaced in their original position on these great uplands, we 
should have Cross Fell, for example, well on to five thousand feet 
above the level of the sea, instead of at its present elevation.
All 
that additional thickness of rock, and, so far as we know, much 
176 
more than that thickness, has been reduced to a transportable form 
by the long-continued action of the various denudants, and swept 
away from that part to form newer strata elsewhere ; and it is not 
until we get well into Northumberland that we begin again to meet 
with the edges of the beds that once extended in continuous sheets 
over all the intervening tract of country, and formed part of one 
great series of deposits with the coal-field of Stainmoor, of IngletQn, 
and, in all probability, of the coal-fields further south as well.
This leads me to remark that although coal is confined in one 
part of England to beds lying above the Millstone Grit, there is a 
general tendency throughout all the Carboniferous series for coals 
to set in at lower and lower horizons as the rocks are traced 
towards the north-west.
Workable coals, some as much as between 
three and four feet in thickness, occur near even the base of the 
Millstone Grit near Stainmoor, to wit, at Tan Hill.
Coals occur at 
lower horizons still, elsewhere, and the coal worked at Borradale, 
on Stainmoor, lies below the Four Fathom Limestone of the Yore- 
dale Rocks.
At somewhat higher horizons comes in the coal 
occurring in the " Coal Sills," which, as the Survey maps and 
sections* of the district will shew, form an important part of the 
coal worked in North Cumberland and the neighbourhood of 
Hexham.
Coal, again occurs at yet a lower horizon just over the Border; 
for the Canobie Coal Field is worked, as Professor Geikie has 
pointed out, in part of the Cement Stone Series, which occupies 
an horizon low down in the Carboniferous rocks in Scotland and 
in the parts of Cumberland and Northumberland extending north- 
wards from Bewcastle.
I have myself t expressed an opinion that 
the Calciferous Sandstones represent a local expansion of the lower 
part of our Mountain Limestone ; while others, amongst whom was 
the late Mr. Ward, consider that they represent a geological 
horizon even lower than that.
Now, I have before mentioned that the Carboniferous rocks 
had been very greatly faulted, disturbed, and denuded before the 
* Sheets 62, Vertical Section,

177 
New Red Period, and we have clear evidence that the New Red 
may cover up rocks belonging to almost every horizon in the 
Carboniferous Series, from the highest rocks occurring in the district 
down to the older rocks near the base of the Carboniferous Series.
Consequently, in speculating upon the probabilities of coal occur- 
ring under the Red Rocks of the Edenside, which the mention of 
the discovery primarily referred to in this communication is sure 
to induce many to do, it has to be borne in mind, not only that 
the various coal fields of the Basin of the Solway, and therefore ot 
the rocks extending under the New Red of Edenside, occur on 
divers and widely-separated horizons in various parts of the great 
pile of the Carboniferous rocks that in late Palaeozoic times 
probably enveloped greater part of the whole district ; but that 
this great pile of Carboniferous rocks was greatly faulted, disturbed, 
and denuded before it was covered up by the thick deposit of New 
Red that, at the present day, forms the surface rock of so large a 
portion of the district.
It follows, therefore, that although the 
preservation of the great thickness of the Upper Carboniferous 
Rocks occurring in the Stainmoor Coal Field may convince us of 
the former extension of the true Coal Measures over our district, 
the' important question of the existence, or the nonexistence, of 
coal-bearing beds beneath the New Red of any other part of the 
district still involves as complicated calculations as heretofore.

Iprotwbings attljc Annual gtceting at ^inbksiiDe, i88^ 
The Annual Meeting of the Association was held this year at Ambleside, 
on Thursday and Friday, the 24th and 25th of May.
The Proceedings were opened on Thursday, at noon, in the Lecture 
Hall, by an Address from the President, Mr. Robert Ferguson, M.P., on 
"The Place Names of Cumberland and Westmorland." A fairly large 
number of members, representing the local Societies of Cumberland and 
Westmorland, being present.
After Luncheon at the Salutation Hotel, the Annual General Meeting 
of the Association was held in the Lecture Hall, the President in the chair.
The Reports of the affiliated Societies having been read by the Association 
Secretary, Mr. R.
S. Ferguson was unanimously chosen President for the 
ensuing year: Mr. Goodchild was re-appointed Editor of the Transactions ; 
and Mr. Robert Crowder, Secretary and Treasurer, in place of Mr.
Kendall, who, through pressure of other work, felt compelled to resign.
Hearty votes of thanks having been passed to the retiring President and 
Secretary, and Penrith having been selected as the place of the Annual 
Meeting of 1884, the members drove to Rydal Mount, the home of Words- 
worth, which, through the kindness of Mr. Jlobert Crewdson, was thrown 
open to the party.
Under the guidance of the Rev. H.
D. Rawnsley, the 
room was inspected where Wordsworth's portrait by Pickersgill (kindly 
lent by Miss Quillinan for the occasion, ) was hung, and the old teapot that 
once belonged to him, and the carved cupboard brought by him from 
Cockermouth, pointed out.
The lovely grounds, then in their full Spring 
beauty, the Nab Well, and the terrace where the poet so often walked, were 
next visited ; after which the party, walking through the grounds of Rydal 
Hall, the beautifully situated seat of Mr. Le Fleming, descended to the 
well known waterfall, and heard with pleasure the lines in which the poet 
accurately described the fall as it was in his day, and is to-day — 
With its bridge 
Half grey, half ulad with ivy to its ridge.
The party then drove along the shore of Rydal Water, passing Nab Cottage, 
once the home of Hartley Coleridge and De Quincey ; walked over the old 
carriage road to Grasmere, past the famous "Wishing Gate" to "Town 
End," where the poet lived before his marriage, where he first met 
De Quincey, and to which he brought home his bi-ide.
After looking over 
the house and garden, which is left as it was when Wordsworth lived 
there, the members drove through Grasmere to Lancrigg, the residence of 
the Eev. H.
M. Fletcher, Eector of Grasmere, where all were most hospit- 
ably entertained at tea.
The beautiful grounds once belonging to the 
famous Arctic traveller.
Sir John Eichardson, were visited ; and an album 
containing autograph letters of Wordsworth, and other distinguished 
characters, was inspected with much interest.
On returning, all stopped 
at Grasmere Church, the burial place of the poet and his family ; Ambleside 
being reached about seven.
After tea in the lecture room, a large audience assembled to hear a most 
eloquent and thoughtful lecture by Professor Knight, on "The True, the 
Beautiful, and the Good." 
On Friday, at ten a.m., original papers were read by several gentlemen, 
most of which will be found in this Part of the Transactions.
At one p.m., 
the members were entertained at luncheon at the Salutation Hotel, by the 
President and Committee of the Ambleside Society, to whom, on the motion 
of the President, a hearty vote of thanks for their efforts for the success of 
the meeting, and kind hospitality, was accorded.
At two, carriages were 
in readiness to take the party to Tarn Haues, Yewdale, and Tilberthwaite 
Gill.
After inspecting the great slate quarries at the entrance of the Gill, 
the party walked up its entire length, stopping a while at a bend of the 
gorge where it turns at right angles to its former course, to hear a short 
address from Mr. Marr, F.G.S., on the eroding agencies that had been at 
work in forming the Gill.
The. grandly picturesque scenery of the upper 
part of the glen well repaid the party for the fatigues of the climb, now 
made comparatively easy for all, through the bridges which Mi-.
Marshall, 
at Professor Ruskin's request, has caused to be thrown across the stream 
wherever necessary.
Returning through the woods on the opposite side of 
the Gill, the members were most kindly entertained at tea in a farm-house 
near at hand, by the Ambleside and District Society, and afterwards drove 
home, reaching Ambleside in the evening.
This concluded the programme of the Ambleside Meeting, which, 
favoured as it was with fine weather, and by the hearty co-operation and 
thoughtful hospitality of the Ambleside and District Society, proved in 
every way a most enjoyable and successful one.

The Committee have pleasure in reporting that the Association 
during the past year, which is the sixteenth of its existence, has 
fully maintained the satisfactory position recorded in the last 
report.
The number of members on the books is 336, of whom 86 are 
associates.
Although a considerable number of new members 
joined the Association during the year, the loss by removals, etc., 
makes the total identical with that of last year.
The finances are in a satisfactory state, though from increased 
expenditure on conversazione, repairs to property, etc., the balance 
to the debit of the Association is almost the same as before.
The Conversazione with which the Session opened, was very 
successful, and the regulations of the Committee as to admission 
obviated the overcrowding complained of in former years.
The Lectures delivered during the Session were of an interesting 
and instructive character, and were all well attended.
The Museum has been enriched by the addition of the following 
gifts :— 
Microscopical Specimens : ...
...
...
Mr. B.
Taylor 
Zoological Specimens : Mr. D.

The Curator reports that there is a falling off in the number of 
specimens presented, but that most of them are valuable.
The Library is in an efficient state ; eighteen new volumes have 
been acquired by purchase, and twelve have been presented by a 
member (Mr. R.
Russell).
It now contains about three hundred 
volumes of standard modern works in science and literature, 
exclusive of patent specifications, magazines, and periodicals.
The circulation of books has increased.
Science Classes have been held during the Session, under the 
direction of Mr. A.
Freeman.
The results of the work of these 
Classes will not however be known till after the examinations next 
month.
In concluding this Report, the Committee desire to express 
their thanks to the donors of gifts to the Museum and Librar)^, 
and to the Lecturers who have so kindly given their services 
during the past Session.

The attendance at the Public Lectures and Ordinary Meetings 
was very satisfactory.
During the Session fifteen new members were proposed and 
duly elected ; but twenty-one failed to make good their member- 
ship, leaving 145 as the number on the books at the present time.
The Treasurer's account shews an income of ;£;^g i6s.
iid., 
and expenditure amounting to j£^c) 14s.
2d., leaving a balance 
on hand of 2s.
gd.
The smallness of the balance is due to the 
fact that the Society, during the past two years, has voted ^20 to 
the funds of the Keswick Library.
The income of the Museum 
of Local Natural History, together with the balance on hand at 
the beginning of the year, amounted to ^g^ iis.
iid., and the 
expenditure was ;^i7 2s.
5d., leaving a balance on hand of 
^78 9S.
6d.
The summer programme consisted of three Excursions or Field 
Days.
The first was to Grasmere, Rydal, Loughrigg Terrace, 
Red Bank, &c., on the 22nd of June.
Tea was provided at the 
Prince of Wales Hotel, after which a paper on " Wordsworth, his 
Life and Works," was read by J.
Maitland, Esq. The second was 
to the ancient Camps at Overwater, Caer Mot, and Castle Howe, 
on the 19th July.
On this occasion a paper was read by J.
Fisher 
Croslhwaite, Esq., F.S.A., on "The Camp at Caer Mot," and also 
a letter on the same subject, written by the late Dr. Leitch.
The 
third was to Scale Hill, by Borrowdale, Honister Pass, and Butter- 
mere.
While tea was being prepared at Scale Hill, some of the 
party ascended Brackenthwaite Hows, where an excellent view of 
the whole valley may be obtained, and from whence the course of 
a desolating flood caused by a water-spout breaking upon Grassmoor 
in the year 1760, may be traced out.
An account of this occur- 
rence was read by the President.
Some of the party also visited 
the old Lead Mine on the right bank of the Cocker, after which 
the return journey was made by way of VVhinlatter.
The following are the Officers and Committee for next Session : — 
President, Rev. William Colville ; Vice-President, Rev. T.

attended, and as popular as those of past years.

The Committee, in presenting the Seventh Annual Report, 
regrets to note a decrease in the membership.
This year the 
members number 124, against 136 last year, shewing a decrease 
XXI.
of 1 2.
The decrease is in part accounted for by the removal of 
several gentlemen from the district.
The attendance at Lectures has on the whole been exceptionally 
good, more particularly in those cases where the subject was 
advertised.
The warmest thanks of the Society are tendered to all those 
gentlemen who took part in the programme.
The new rule adopted last Session, of issuing Family Tickets at 
a charge of los.
each, has worked well.
A satisfactory balance remains in the hands of the Treasurer.

interesting and instructive character.
During the Summer months 
Excursions were held to Springkell, Liddell Moat, Sandysykes 
Brick and Tile Works, and to Naworth Castle, all of which were 
very much enjoyed by those members who had opportunities of 
joining in them.
The Winter Session was carried out according to the Programme 
arranged by the Committee, with the exception of the paper on 
" Spiritualism," by the Rev. Jos.
Wallace, who found a substitute 
in Mr. Jackson of Carlisle, who read a very interesting paper on 
"Flower Lore;" and that on "Sir James Graham," by the Rev.
P. Carruthers, who was prevented by ill health ; and the lecture 
on " Monkeys," by J.
G. Goodchild, Esq., who was absent from 
the district at the time of his appointment.

XXIU.
The attendance at the Meetings was not so large as the merits 
of the lectures and papers deserved ; and the Committee regret to 
have to report for the first time a falling off in the membership ; 
but that is in a great measure owing to the removal of several 
members from the neighbourhood.
The Session was wound up 
with a social Tea Meeting, which was kindly provided and carried 
out by the lady members.
After tea a Musical Entertainment was 
given, and a very enjoyable evening spent.
At the annual business meeting, the Secretary reported that the 
income from all sources, including a balance of los.
from last year, 
and a profit of jP^2 2s.
gd.
from Mr. Vallance's entertainment, 
amounted to p{^ ID 19s.
rod.; total expenses, ^10 12s.
gd.; leaving 
a balance in hand of 7s.
id.
The Committee wish to thank all who have so ably contributed 
to the work of the Society during the past season, and hope that 
the Society may still be enabled to prove a source of usefulness 
and intellectual recreation in the future.

A course of Twelve Lectures on "Europe in Pre-Historic Times," 
was given by J.
E. Marr, M.A., F.G.S., Fellow of St. John's College, 
Cambridge, during the months of October, November, and December.
The 
attendance was not so good as in previous years, and the pecuniary results 
were disastrous : they do not, however, fall upon this Society.
During the Sesf!io7i the following Lectures have been delivered: —

The Committee, in presenting their Sixth Annual Report, have 
to congratulate the members on the success of another Session.
During the past year two most important meetings have been 
held in Carlisle, namely, the Annual Meeting of the Cumberland 
Association, and also the visit of the Royal Archaeological Institute 
of Great Britain and Ireland.
During the season three Field Days have been held, commencing 
May 31st to Corby Walks, in connection with the Annual Meeting 
of the Cumberland Association ; the second to Talkin Tarn, in 
conjunction with the Brampton Club ; and the third to Head's 
Nook.
The attendance of members on the two last days was not 
large, but the Committee attribute this to the numerous excursions 
on the occasion of the visit of the Royal Archaeological Institute.
Upwards of one hundred copies of the Transactions have been 
gratuitously distributed among the members.

neighbouring fells.
The Society now numbers 121 members, being five more than 
reported last year.
The Treasurer's account shows a good balance.

The

comparatively large number of Ordinary Meetings augurs well for 
the continued success of the Society.

NOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION.
At the Council Meeting held at Penrith on the 27th of August, 
1883, several resolutions relating to the management of the Associ- 
ation were discussed and adopted.
The most important of these referred to the affiliation of the 
Cumberland Association with the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science.
The advisability of taking advantage 
of every opportunity of raising the status of the Cumberland 
Association is too obvious to need to be pointed out, and the 
Council at once decided to take the steps necessary to bring about 
the affiliation proposed.
The choice of Delegate lay between our Association President 
and a member of the Cumberland Association, who should be 
also a member of the British Association, and should be nominated 
by him.
The President being unable to attend, nominated our 
Association Secretary, Mr. Robert Crowder, who was present at 
the Southport Meeting, and duly represented the .'\ssociation as a 
member of the General Committee, and also at the fourth Confer- 
ence of Delegates of Scientific Societies held during the Meeting 
of the British Association.
The principal business before the 
Conference was the consideration of the Preliminary Report of 
the "Local Scientific Societies'" Committee, appointed by the 
Council of the Association "tO draw up suggestions upon methods 
of more systematic observation and plans of operation for Local 
Societies, together with a more uniform mode of pubHcation of the 
results of their work ; and also to draw up a list of Societies which 
pubHsh their proceedings." This Committee, after communicating 
with all such Societies known to them, suggest : — 
1. The grouping, as much as may be practicable, of the smaller 
Societies round local sub-centres, each of which shall send a repre- 
sentative to the British Association Meeting, to confer as to the 
best methods of carrying on combined and systematic scientific 
investigation throughout the country, and of publishing the results 
in a uniform manner.
2. The Committee instance the following subjects as suitable 
for such combined work, selected from amongst those assigned to 
Committees of the Association during the past five years, and 
arranged in the order of the Sections concerned in them : — 
(a) Luminous Meteors ; Meteoric Dust in various localities ; 
Rainfall; Underground Temperature (rate of increase downwards).
(b) Erosion of Sea-Coasts ; Height of Underground Waters ; 
Erratic Blocks (position, height above sea,lithological character, &c.) 
(c) Photographs of Typical Races and Crosses ; Ancient 
Earthworks ; Prehistoric Remains ; Migration of Birds at Light- 
houses and Light-ships ; Periodical Natural Phenomena (flowering 
of certain plants, arrival of migratory birds, appearance of certain 
insects, &c.); Injurious Insects (their first appearance, injuries 
caused by them, degree of success in preventing them, &c.) 
(d) Anthropometric Collections ; Working of Education Code 
in Elementary Schools ; Rudimentary Science in Schools.
(e) Effective Wind-Pressure on Buildings.
XXXV.
3- They suggest the adoption by the Council of certain new 
rules, after having first been submitted to and approved by the 
Local Societies, of which the following are the points of more 
general interest : — 
(a) That application may be made by any Society publishing 
scientific Memoirs, to be placed on the list of "Corresponding 
Societies of the British Association." 
(b) That these applications be referred to a Committee 
appointed by the Council to consider them, and also the annual 
work of these Societies generally, making an annual report to the 
Recommendations Committee on the subject.
(O The privileges of such Corresponding Societies to consist 
m : — 
(i.) The insertion, in the Annual Report of the British 
Association, of a List of the titles of such of the Society's 
Scientific Memoirs of the previous year as come under the 
cognizance of one or other of the Sections of the Association.
(ii.) The right to nominate any one of its members (being 
also a member of the British Association,) as its Delegate to 
represent the Society at the Annual Meeting, who shall have for 
the time the rights of a member of the General Committee.
(d) These Delegates shall constitute a Committee which the Sec- 
retary of the Association shall summon to hold one or more meetings 
during the Annual Meeting, under a Chairman and with a Secretary 
appointed by the Council.
The Secretaries of Sections shall send 
copies of any recommendations which the Presidents of Sections 
may make on matters in which the co-operation of Corresponding 
Societies is desired, to the Secretary of the Delegates' Committee 
who shall then invite the authors of these recommendations to 
discuss with the Committee the best way of carrying them into 
effect.
It will then be the duty of the Delegates to bring these 
recommendations clearly before their respective Societies.
The Report having been read and discussed, was (with some 
suggested slight modifications in the wording) approved of by the 
Conference, and it was then left for the final acceptance of the 
Council and the General Committee.
In the event of its beitig 
adopted, the opinion was expressed that the official recognition for 
the first time by the British Association of the representatives of 
Local Societies would be a step likely to prove of great importance 
to their interests and usefulness.
A paper on "Local Science Societies and the Minor Pre- 
Historic Remains of Britain," was read by Mr. Meldola, urging 
the importance of such Societies undertaking the local supervision 
of remains of this kind, and recommending them to communicate 
with the Inspector of Ancient Monuments (Generail Pitt Rivets 
on the subject.
Another paper was also read by Mr. Sawyer, on the " Work of 
Local Natural History Societies," referring especially to the 
desirability of forming Unions of Local Societies at various con- 
venient centres, for discussion and more united action.
These papers having been discussed at some length, the pro- 
ceedings of the Conference terminated.
The Association Secretary frequently receives requests for copies 
of our Transactions in exchange for the publications of other 
scientific bodies ; and the Council have approved of a provisional 
xxxyii.
arrangement whereby books so received shall be used as an 
Association Circulating Library, to be located at some centre 
hereafter to be decided upon, so as to be available for the use of 
any members of the several Associated Societies.
As this feature 
is likely to develop before long into one of considerable import- 
ance, many questions relating to its management in the future have 
been left for consideration at the next Annual Meeting.
It is to 
be hoped that additions may be received in other ways than by 
tjie system of exchans:es referred to, and that, in time, the Council, 
may see their way to setting apart a small portion of the Associ- 
ation funds for the purchase of books suitable for such a circulating 
library.
The question of a Museum Convention for the circulation of 
objects of interest, is another matter that might profitably be 
considered qn the same occasion.
The Council have approved of a fev^ pages of the Trans- 
actions hemg devoted to the insertion of such Notes or Original 
Observations, upon subjects coming within the domain of Science, 
as may be deemed by the contributors to be not of sufficient 
importance to form the subject of articles of a more lengthy 
nature.
The Notes inserted in the present volume may be taken 
as examples of what is intended; but provided the contributions 
are to the point, they need not necessarily be very short.
' 
It has also been decided that in future, Abstracts of Papers, 
and Reprints of Papers at the Author's Expense, shall, subject to 
the Council's approval, be permitted to appear in the Transaawns.
The Council have already expressed the opinion that papers 
submitted with a view to being inserted in the Transac/wns should 
be, as much as possible, original articles upon subjects relating to 
the district of Cumberland and Westmorland ; and the Council, in 
selecting from the MSS.
sent in, have given the preference in 
every case to articles of this description.
But as the space avail- 
able is limited, and several articles of interest have had, from time 
to time, to be omitted, it may be worth while to take into consider- 
ation at the Annual Meeting whether articles of an archaeological 
nature should appear in our Transactions, seeing that a separate 
journal specially devoted to the Archaeology of Cumberland and 
Westmorland already exists.
Another point to be discussed at the next Annual Meeting 
relates to the Title of the Association.
Two Westmorland Societies 
are already affiliated, and a third, the Penrith Society, numbers 
almost as many members living in Westmorland as in Cumberland.
Moreover, many of the articles inserted in the Transactions relate 
as much to one county as to the other.
The Council have there- 
fore approved of the question being laid before the members in 
this way, in order that the desirability of modifying the title of the 
Association in such a manner as to embrace Westmorland as well 
as- Cumberland, may be discussed at the Annual Meeting, after all 
the members concerned have given it due consideration.
As regards the Transactions, it only remains to state that the 
Council have decided that, hereafter, authors of papers printed in 
the Transactions shall receive Twenty separate copies of their 
papers gratis.
Additional copies may be had of the printers, at the 
rate of one penny per copy of every eight pages, provided a 
notice be given to the Editor when the proof is returned.

NOTES ON THE PLACE-NAMES OF CUMBERLAND 
AND WESTMORLAND.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS BY ROBT.
FERGUSON, M.P., F.S.A., 
At the Ambleside Annual Meeting.
Etymological Geography might be supposed to be somelhing 
of a rather technical and of a somewhat dry pursuit, but any one 
who has studied Mr. Isaac Taylor's " Words and Places " can 
hardly fail to perceive how closely the place-names of a district 
are connected with its early life and ancient history.
In these 
two counties of Cumberland and Westmorland this is the case to 
a greater extent than elsewhere, for much of their early history is 
a blank on which these names tend very materially to throw some 
light.
It happens indeed occasionally that very important results 
depend upon the proper explanation of a place-name, and I 
remember a somewhat striking incident of this kind that happened 
many years ago.
It was a case of right of water that was being 
tried in the Irish courts, and in which the celebrated Daniel 
O'Connell was counsel on behalf of the right.
Now, the weir in 
which this right was vested was called Lax Weir, and it was con- 
tended by the opposition that Lax Weir could only mean " loose 
weir," and that such a meaning was fatal to the claim.
O'Connell 
found it difficult to make head against this argument, and had 
small hope of winning his cause.
Just at the most critical 
moment a scrap of paper was handed to him on which were written 
the words — " Lax is Danish for salmon." O'Connell read it and 
rose up a new man.
He shewed that Lax Weir was one of the 
many Scandinavian names still surviving in a district where the 
1 
Northmen had long held rule, and that it meant nothing more 
than " Salmon Weir." O'Connell won his case, but he could 
never find out who the unknown friend was who had thus given 
him the key to victory.
Now, in regard to the place-names of a district, I would make 
the preliminary observation, that we ought never, if we can help 
it, to treat a name as if it stood alone, but always collate the names 
which seem to partake of the same form, both in that and as far 
as possible, also in other districts.
There is, for an example, a well- 
known place in London where the rank and fashion congregate, 
and which is called " Rotten Row." This has been explained as 
from the French " Route de roi," the king's road.
This deriva- 
tion, by no means a satisfactory one in itself, becomes impossible 
in face of the fact that, the name of Rotten Row occurs in various 
other counties and in Cumberland among others.
And so far 
from being from the French, the English " rotten row" is no 
doubt nearer to the mark, as referring to perhaps a row of decayed 
trees.
In the first place, then, let us deal with the names of the two 
counties themselves, Cumberland and Westmorland.
Cumberland 
(in the Saxon Chronicle Cumbralarni) has been explained as the 
land of combes or valleys, a derivation not I think very satisfactory 
in itself, inasmuch as it seems to me that it is the mountains as 
the more salient feature, and not the valleys, that would give the 
name.
But Mr. Henry Bradley, who, though its papers have 
unfortunately not been published in a collected form, is one of 
our most trustworthy guides in local etymology, has shewn, in an 
article on "The Names of the English Counties" in the Gentle- 
maris Magazine, that this derivation is etymologically impossible, 
and that Cumberland means " the land of the Cymry." And he 
further maintains that the name, like that of the Cumbraes (islands 
of the Cymry) in the Frith of Clyde, was one given by the Scan- 
dinavian conquerors of the north-west.
The name of Westmor- 
land (Westmoringa-land) is, on the other hand, clearly of Anglo- 
Saxon origin, signifying " the land of the dwellers on the western 
m-oors," and it shews, observes Mr. Bradley, " that the district was 
a western offshoot of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria." 
Thus the ijiames of both these two counties assist to establish 
certain points of their ancient history.
In considering the local nomenclature of a district, we shall 
invariably find that the objects which most tenaciously retain their 
ancient names are, first, the rivers ; and, secondly, the mountains.
With regard to the rivers, the reason is apparent.
A river is not 
localized like anything else ; it passes in its course by many places 
where men have settled, none of which have perhaps any clairn 
more than another to give it a name, and therefore it is allowed as 
a matter of common convenience to retain its ancient name.
Indeed, very much perhaps for this reason, many rivers, both in 
England and elsewhere, seem never to have had a proper name of 
their own at all, and to have been known simply as " the water." 
Of these we have one, the Esk, a word which in its various forms 
of Esk, Exe, Ash, and Usk, signifying simply water, is found all 
over the kingdom, and in kindred forms, in France, Germany, and 
elsewhere.
The rivers, then, in Cumberland and Westmorland, 
may be said, with very few exceptions, to retain their original 
Celtic names.
But we have two or three which do not seem to 
be Celtic, and which are more probably Scandinavian.
" The 
Danes," observes Mr. Bradley, " unlike the Anglo-Saxons, some- 
what frequently, invented river-names of their own." Of these he 
has quoted four in our district, the Greta, Rotha, Brathay, and the 
Caldew.
This was in fact originally my own suggestion, though 
he has proposed in some cases a different, perhaps a better 
derivation.
The Greta has been derived from O.N. grdta, Sco.
greit, to weep, in reference to the wailing sound of its waters.
But greit means, I think, rather to weep silently than to wail, and 
Mr. Bradley's derivation from O.N. grj'ot, stone, Eng. grii, is 
perhaps better, giving it the meaning of " rocky river." But there 
is another suggestion which it may be worth while to make, that 
of " grinding river." As there are mills on the Greta at present, 
so there may have been, though of a rude kind, in ancient days.
I am not, however, sure about the corresponding O.N. word, 
whether it was used otherwise than poetically.
The Brathay, in 
the sense of the rapid river, would be derived appropriately from 
the O.N., but I am not sure of the Rotha as meaning '-red river." 
This I should hardly take to be its distinguishing characteristic ; 
it certainly is a rapid stream, and may be from the same origin as 
the Rhodanus, or Rhone, though in any case the ending is 
Danish.
The Calder or Calda seems to be evidently Scandinavian, 
the original stream being called Cald beck (cold brook), and when 
it attains to the dignity of a river, being called Calda (O.N. d 
river).
We find such names elsewhere where the Northmen have 
been, e.g., a river Kalda in Iceland, and a brook Caudebec in 
Normandy.
It seems probable that the Calder is the same name, 
a final r being so slurred as not to be distinguishable in English.
Some other names which may more probably be Celtic have had 
the O.N. d river added as a termination.
The word deck for drook may also be taken to be of Danish 
origin, though etymologically there is nothing distinctively Scan- 
dinavian in the word, which is the same as the Germ, dac/i.
But 
it is a word which distinctively marks out the Danish district in 
England, and does not occur in the more purely Anglo-Saxon 
district.
Hence the name of Cnmimock water, derived from 
the stream, the Crummock, which feeds it, and which is no doubt 
a corruption of Crumbeck, crooked or winding beck, corresponding 
with the name Krumbach, of various streams in Germany.
Other words of Scandinavian origin are farn (O.N. ijeni), a 
small lake, and force (O.N. fors), a waterfall.
This latter word, 
which in Norway itself has been corrupted into foss, Cleasby 
describes as "a test-word of Scandinavian language and origin.'' 
And he quotes from a Byzantine writer the names of several water- 
falls in Russian and in Sclavonic, from which it appears that in 
Russian the word for water-fall was forsi^ thus shewing that the 
language was at that time Scandinavian.
We have one name, 
that of Airey Force on UUswater, which may perhaps contain a 
reduplication, airey representing the Celtic, and force the Scan- 
dinavian word signifying water-fall.
It is perhaps, liowever, more 
probable that Airey is from O.N. eyri, point or promontory, which 
I think is in accord with the local characteristics of the place.
^Vhen we come to the names of mountains we find a nomen- 
clature distinctly Scandinavian, although there are some mountains 
which still retain their old Celtic names.
Southey rescued the 
Celtic name of Saddleback, Blencathra, which in a few more years 
would no doubt have been irretrievably lost.
This has been 
explained as meaning "peak of tempests," but I think that the most 
simple and natural explanation is Blencathair, from cai/iair, chair 
or seat, thus making it in point of fact, of pretty nearly the same 
meaning as its other name Saddleback.
Another mountain which 
still retains its old Celtic name is Helvellyn.
There have been 
various fanciful and poetical attemps to connect the name of this 
mountain with the worship of Bel or Belin ; the etymology I have 
to propose is much more prosaic, and therefore, I venture to think, 
more probable.
Acting upon the principle I laid down at starting 
of collating the names in a district, we shall find one other 
mountain-name in a similar form to Helvellyn, viz., that of Rivelin 
by the side of Ennerdale water.
This is also a mountain-name in 
Wales, and has been explained as " red mountain," and in a 
similar manner Helvellyn is probably the " yellow mountain." 
This is the explanation given in the Journal of the Philological 
Society by the late Dr. Guest, who, as he was one of the most 
cautious, was one of the most trustworthy of etymologists.
But with these and one or two other exceptions the mountain- 
names are distinctly Scandinavian, the word, fell (O.N.
/Jail) not 
being found in any of the Saxon dialects.
We have among others 
Souter Fell, which may be the same name as Sauda Fell in 
Iceland, from saudr, sheep, a final r in English being, as I before 
noted, unrecognizable in pronunciation.
The name of Fairfield 
was supposed by De Quincey to be of a similar origin, and to be 
a corruption of Fair Fell, from faar, sheep, whence the name of 
the Faroes, "sheep islands." To this I before took exception, 
chiefly on the ground that there is no other instance of the change 
of fell into Jield.
But on the whole I am inclined to think that 
this is hardly a sufl[icient objection, and that this derivation may 
stand good till some one can suggest a better.
Hest Fell 
corresponds with a Hesten Fell {i/tc Horse Fell, tlic article being 
a post-fix) in Norway, in what sense given it remains to find out.
Tong Fell also corresponds with a mountain in Iceland, the word, 
as Cleasby observes, being commonly applied in local names to 
anything resembling the shape of a tongue.
Mell Fell, which also 
corresponds with a Mel Fell in Norway, may perhaps be firom 
O.N. tnelr, a kind of bent-grass which grows on sandy soil.
(Of 
this word, which also means a sand-hill covered with bent grass, 
and also a bare sand-bank, and which is common in local names 
in Iceland, we seem to have more distinct traces along the coast 
where such vegetation is most common.
We have Melay near 
AUonby, perhaps properly Melar (plural " sand-hills"), and so the 
same as a Melar in Iceland, and we have Esk meals, which I 
suppose to be sand-banks at the mouth of the river Esk).
There 
is another mountain called Mellbreak, but for this I may perhaps 
venture to suggest a different explanation.
The O.N. brekka 
signified a slope, and was applied to the hill where public meetings 
were held and laws promulgated.
The prefix mel in this case 
might then be from O.N. mAl, conference, and the hill, which is 
by the side of Crummock lake, might be the place of public 
meeting for the Northmen of the surrounding district.
I, how- 
ever, suggest this with diffidence, for I have learned to suspect a 
derivation whenever it promises to be a little more interesting than 
usual.
There is, however, a mountain in Norway called Lovbrekke 
which may be from the Dan. lov, law, and which therefore may 
rather favour the above explanation.
But if our word break be, 
as I rather suppose, the same as the O.N. brekka, it is a word 
which seems in an etymological point of view to stand alone.
For the word concerned is the same as Eng.
" brink," and I do 
not know of another instance in which we follow the Old Northern 
speech in similarly leaving out the nasal.
Thus, for an instance, 
the O.N. brattr, steep, becomes with us brant.
There is a word 
latter found in mountain names, as Latterbarrow, Latrigg, and 
VVhinlatter, which is somewhat puzzling.
There is a mountain 
called Latrabjorg which compares etymologically with our Latter- 
barrow, and which Cleasby derives from l&,tr, a place where 
animals lay their young, and which we may perhaps accept in 
default of a better explanation.
Coming to some of the terms connected with mountains we 
have the word gill, applied to the fissure or small ravine made by 
a torrent running down the mountain side.
I doubt, however, 
whether the sense of water is inherent in the word, though 
Cleasby thinks that it is ; the root-meaning seems to me to be 
only that of cleft.
Hence has been derived the name of Gilsland' 
where is the well-known spa.
But this derivation is utterly out of 
the question — in the first place Gilsland is not the land of gils — 
no Cumberland or Westmorland man would call the deep ravine 
in which the river Irthing runs a gill — and, secondly, as an 
etymological form it would be scarcely possible.
Not any more 
reasonable is the suggestion in Cleasby's Icelandic Dictionary 
that Gilsland is from Dan. lund, a grove — surely land is a terra that 
does not require to be explained away.
Gilsland is, there can 
hardly be a doubt, the land of a man called Gill, and probably of 
that Gill who appears in county history as the son of Bueth, the 
latter being himself represented in the neighbouring place-names 
Boothby, "Booth's village," and in Bewcastle, formerly Bueth- 
castle.
Gill, in the sense of which I am now speaking, never 
occurs as a prefix, and such names as Gilcrux and Gilgarron are, 
as I shall have occasion to note, from an entirely different origin.
I have to protest against the present fashion of spelling the word 
ghyl, introduced, I believe, by Miss Martineau.
It is intended no 
doubt to shew that the g is hard, but it outrages the etymology in 
a manner that would not be allowed in the case of any English 
word.
The word man, applied to the pile of stones placed to 
mark the top of a mountain, as e.g., Skiddaw Man, and which has 
been derived, by no means satisfactorily, from the Celtic niaen, 
stone, may also be capable of a Scandinavian derivation.
There 
is a word mcena, to project, jut out, and which is applied to the 
top ridge of a house, which would seem to present the appropriate 
meaning of summit, culmen ; but as I do not as yet know whether 
there is any trace of the word as so applied to a mountain in the 
Scandinavian north, I must suspend coming to a more definite 
conclusion.
Another word used throughout the district to express a hill or 
8 
smaller eminence, is Ilo7v^ from the O.N. haugr.
Though generally 
used in reference to a smaller hill, it is in one or two cases, such 
as Silver How, applied to one of considerable height.
It is often 
coupled with a personal name, Scandinavian or otherwise, for 
which there may be two reasons.
It was a custom among the 
Northmen, as we learn from Icelandic records, for a man to have 
a "how" near his house, so that from the top of it he could 
survey his farm and see what was going on (rather an easy-going 
kind of inspection, it would seem to us, for one of such an 
energetic race).
This, then, might be one reason why the word is 
so often coupled with a personal name, though probably not the 
principal one.
The term "how" was applied to the mound of 
earth that was raised over the grave of any man of consequence, 
and in most cases in our district it seems probable that the name 
is commemorative of the chieftain who was buried there.
Hence 
we have Lowden How, Gunner's How (sometimes incorrectly 
Gummer's How on the maps), Scout How, and Torpenhow.
Lowden is from the Scandinavian man's-name Lodinn, signifying 
" shaggy," and it is noteworthy that though the name Lowden is 
not a common one in England generally, it is one that still 
flourishes in the surrounding district, being, among others, that of 
a mighty wrestler, who does not disgrace his Scandinavian ances- 
tors.
Torpenhow has been derived from three words, tor, pen, 
and how, all signifying, though in different languages, a height.
But, I think, that the name is derived most naturally from the 
Danish Thorfinn, whence, as supposed, came the name of the 
noted Dick Turpin, out of whom the civilization of centuries had 
not eradicated the predatory instincts of his ancestors.
The 
name, I may observe, is found in its more correct form in 
Thorfinssty, from sti, a foot-path.
There are some other cases in 
which "how" is found in conjunction with a name not dis- 
tinctively Scandinavian, and one, Hunting How, where if a man's 
name at all (which I rather suppose it to be) it may be either 
Anglo-Saxon or Danish.
In the neighbouring county of Northumberland our word how 
changes into haugh, whence the name Featherstonhaugh, repre- 
senting the lioiu or liaugh of a man — Anglo-Saxon or Dane — 
called Frithestan.
It may perhaps be worth while to inves- 
tigate the reason why our word how changes into haugh in 
Northumberland, particularly as the same principle assists to 
throw light upon some of the other place-names of our district.
The reason is a very simple one — the ancient word was hang, 
ending with a g.
Now, a final g is displeasing to the English ear, 
and it has got rid of it in two different ways.
Most commonly 
it drops it, as in day for dag, may for mag, lie for lig, but not 
unfrequently it changes it into f, as for instance, in trough for 
trog, the g often remaining, to attest its origin, in the spelling.
Sometimes the same word is treated in both ways, as from A,S.
genug we have both enough and enow.
In the present case, then, 
the difference is simply this, that we get rid of the g by dropping 
it, and the Northumbrians by changing it into f.
That, however, 
you will say, would give them hotvf and not haugh.
But any one 
who knows the Northumbrian dialect, and the way in which it 
narrows the vowels, pronouncing the ha in hall like the inter- 
jection " hah," will see at once how howf is made into haugh.
I 
have observed that this same principle throws light on some other 
of the place-names of the district.
Thus there is a place called 
Brough in Westmorland, and there is also a Burgh in Cumberland.
This is just the same word that is found elsewhere as " borough," 
properly burh, and not a dissyllable, only in the one case the g is 
dropped, and in the other it is pronounced as f.
Again, we have 
many mountains in the district called " barrow," and we have one, 
near Bassenthwaite, called Barf.
These both represent the same 
word, the O.N. bjarg, mountain, which in the one case becomes 
" barrow," (again not properly a dissyllable) and in the other 
becomes "barf." 
When we come to names more nearly connected witli human 
occupation, we find in Cumberland, the ancient "land of the 
Cymry," but scanty traces of the original inhabitants.
We may 
include all the names formed from bleu, as Blencogo, Blencow, 
Blencairn, and Blennerhasset ; those from caer, as Carlisle, Cargo, 
10 
and Cardurnock ; those from glen, as Lamplugh, formerly Glan- 
ploiigh, Glencoin, Glenridding, Glenderaterra, and Glenderamakin ; 
in dun, as Dundraw.
Then we have two names of a religious 
origin, Gilcrux and Gilgarron, properly Cilcrux and Cilgarron, 
from Cymric cyl, chapel, the former being the " chapel of the 
cross," and the latter being from Gerain, the name of a Cymric 
saint.
Neither do the traces of the Anglo-Saxons appear to be very 
considerable in either of these two counties.
There is in Cumber- 
land a cluster of names along the coast in a line from Workington 
to St. Bees, as Harrington, Distington, Hensingham, Frizington, 
etc., all of which the medial ing shews to be Anglo-Saxon.
Mr.
Kemble has shewn that the earliest Saxon occupation of England 
proceeded by little clans or families, of which ing, signifying son, 
descendant, was the characteristic sign in place-names, and he has 
classed our names as some that might be of the same kind.
But this, 
it seems to me, is extremely doubtful — it would depend upon the 
ancient forms of these names, of which we are entirely ignorant.
If the ancient form of Hensingham for instance, were Hensingaham, 
it would shew it to be one of these gentile or family names, other- 
wise the ing may only be a possessive indicating proprietorship.
In any case it seems to me hardly reasonable to suppose that there 
could be any Anglo-Saxon settlements in Cumberland at such an 
early date, for all those family settlements referred to by Kemble 
seem to have been made in pre-Christian times, and it seems more 
probable that all these settlements on the Cumberland coast might 
be made at the same time and under the same auspices as that of 
the restoration of the religious house of St. Bees after the 
conquest.
Workington I should rather suppose to be properly Wokington, 
the Wokings being a clan or family found elsewhere in England, 
and whence the name of Woking in Surrey, though Workington is 
not impossible.
Harrington was anciently Haverington, and 
would be perhaps more properly Everington, from the man's name 
Evor, signifying boar, common in A.S. times, and whence we have 
11 
still many names, as Everard, Everett, etc.
And Hensingham 
would, I take it, be properly Ansingham, from a/is, common in 
ancient names, and signifying semi-deus.
Of the characteristic A.S. weorih, a property or farm, there 
is, as far as I know, only one single instance, that of Crosby- 
Ravensworth, in Westmorland, and that is extremely uncertain, 
the name being formerly often found as Ravenswath ; Naworth 
in Cumberland I should also suppose to be properly Nawa///, 
from 7vath, a ford, as indicating perhaps a ford over the river 
Irthing.
The A.S. grove and hurst are almost entirely super- 
seded in our district by the Danish shaw and with.
The latter 
is the same word in a Scandinavian form as the A.S. wood: 
hence Skirvvith near Penrith is simply the equivalent of Sher- 
wood in southern England.
There is another Scandinavian word 
for a grove, lund, but this seems to have been more especially 
applied to a sacred grove, and this may probably be the sense in 
Hof Lund, near Appleby, /;(?/" being a temple.
A distinction was 
made in O.N. between hof, a temple with a roof, and horgr, an 
altar, circle ; or any roofless place of worship.
This latter word, 
horgr, is found in the ending argh of some places in Yorkshire as 
Grimsargh, the temple of Grim or Odin, and may be the same 
word as "ark," found in some places in the Lake district, as Pavey 
Ark. The word Pavey I cannot explain, unless possibly it may 
be ixompauji, a lurking fiend — if this were one of the places of 
worship of the older Celtic inhabitants, the Northmen may have 
had some superstitious idea respecting it.
When we come to the names referring to the abodes of men we 
find the Scandinavian by, thorp, thwaite, garth, toft, predominate 
over the ton and the ham which are more exclusively characteristic 
of the Saxon occupation.
Of these terms all but thorp would be 
applicable to a single dwelling, the root oiby signifying "habitation,"' 
garth and toft signifying "inclosure," and thivaite, at least so I 
think, "clearing" in a forest.
But the root of thorp,.yi\\\c}a.
is the 
same as the Germ, dorf, contains something of the sense of crowding 
or huddling together, and Cleasby thinks that it was originally 
applied to the houses of the peasantry crowded together in a 
12 
hamlet.
Hence it was more common in a flat country like Denmark 
than in Norway or Iceland.
And in our own district where as 
usual in mountainous countries the population was sparse, the 
word occurs but rarely, and only in the more flat part of the 
country.
I do not know of it in Cumberland, though in West- 
morland we have Milnthorp, Hackthorpe, and Crackenthorpe.
Another word for a dwelling is bol, whence Bowness (formerly 
Bolness) on the Solway, and Bowness on Windermere, from ness a 
promontory.
Bol is a contraction of boti, as found in A.S., and which 
we have in the name of the village Bothel, which may be more 
probably Anglo-Saxon.
Such contractions as bol for botl were 
much in favour among the Northmen, and it may probably be 
from them that we derive similar contractions in our own dialect.
Some of you may perhaps remember the story, which I think 
ought to be treasured as an example of Westmorland independence; 
of the Prince of Wales at Grasmere.
He happened, in the course 
of his rambles, to disturb the sheep on one of the islands, upon 
which the old woman in charge proceeded to give him " a bit of 
her mind." "Don't you know it's the Prince of Wales?" whispered 
one of the attendants.
"And if it be the Prince of Wales," replied 
the sturdy old dame, " he has nae business to mell wi' t' sheep," 
a rebuke which I have no doubt the Prince took with his usual 
good humour.
But what I want to note is that mell for meddle is 
a contraction of precisely the same kind as bol for botl.
I shall 
have to refer to it again in regard to the name of Keswick.
There is in Cumberland a curious name, Unthank — and there is 
another just outside the border near Langholm — which puzzled me 
until I found it explained by Mr. Bradley.
It is one which occurs 
in various counties, and denotes the abode ot a squatter — from 
A.S. unthances, "without leave," i.e., of the proprietor.
An additional proof of the Scandinavian character of the district 
is to be found in the many names of Northmen which are associated 
with its place-names.
For among the Northmen, as among the 
Anglo-Saxons, the most common name by which a property could 
be called was that of its owner.
Now as a general rule Anglo- 
Saxon and Scandinavian names march together, and thus there are 
13 
many names which though they may more probably be Scandinavian, 
yet which we have no right, judging by the names themselves, to 
pronounce to be such.
Yet there are some distinctively Scandin- 
avian names about which there can be no mistake, such as Ketil, 
Ulf, Orm, Dolfin, Thurstan, Thorfinn.
The name Ketil, which 
which was from a mythological origin, is found in Kettleside, 
Kettlewell, Kelton (formerly Ketilton), and I venture to think also 
in Keswick for Kelswick.
Among the Northmen themselves Ketil 
was frequently, on the principle of contraction to which I before 
alluded, made into Kel, and I think that Keswick is Ketilswick, 
from the little bay (O.N. vie) which forms at present the harbour 
for its boats.
From Ulf and Orm, the Scandinavian forms of Wulf 
and Worm (snake), we have respectively Ullswater (Ulfswater), 
Ullthwaite, Ulpha, Ousby, (formerly Ulfsby), &c., and Ormside, 
Ormthwaite, Ormsgill, &c.
From Dolfin (prop.
Dolgfin) we have 
Dovenby, formerly Dolphinby, Dolphin Sty, (S:c.
From Thurstan 
we have Thurstan's Water, the old name of Coniston lake, and 
from Thorfin we have Torfings Sty and Torpenhow.
It will be 
seen that side as a local word is often coupled with a personal 
name, and this may be the case with regard to Ambleside, though 
the man's name Hamil or Amal is not exclusively Scandinavian.
Then there are two or three names which though borne by 
Northmen, are not of Scandinavian origin, but were borrowed by 
them from the Irish or the Gael.
One of these names is Bekan, 
found in Bekan's Gill and probably in Beacon Tarn and Beaconhill.
The last named was opened many years ago, and therein was found 
the skeleton of a gigantic warrior, who from the character of his 
arms, must have been a Northman.
Another name of the same 
kind is Melmor, found in Melmerby.
According to the Denton 
MSS., Ulf, Thorkel, and Melmor, the three sons of Haldane, 
settled at and gave the names to — Ulfsby, now Ousby, Thorkelly 
near Keswick, and Melmerby.
The writer is not always to be 
trusted, but there does not seem any reason for doubting him in 
this case, where indeed the names remain to speak for themselves.
Now the name Melmor occurs in a runic inscription in the Isle 
of Man in connection with other names unquestionably Scandin- 
u 
avian, and is pronounced by Professor Worsaae to be a Gaelic or 
Irish name borrowed by the Northmen.
The fact then of such 
names being found also in our district goes some little way to 
support the theory which I advanced some years ago, that in 
addition to the more purely Danish settlers who landed on the 
coast of Yorkshire and gradually worked their way up north to 
Cumberland and Westmorland, there was also an immigration 
more purely Norwegian from Ireland by way of the Isle of Man, 
if indeed this was not, as Mr. Bradley suggests, the earlier invasion 
of the two.
Of the Normans who last appeared upon the scene — Northmen 
again, though mixed with a Gallic element — we find some trace in 
such names as Roberby for Robertby, Richardby, Maughanby, and 
probably Aglionby, though Aglin, like Robert and Richard, though 
a name coming through the Normans, is Teutonic, i.e. Prankish, 
in its origin.
There is also to be found, as it seems to me, to be 
found in the name of Christenbury Crags.
No derivation of 
Christenbury that I have seen is grammatically possible ; but if we 
suppose a proper name Christenburg, burg in English becoming 
bury, all difficulty disappears.
Christenburg is one of those curious 
hybrid names given by the early Frankish converts to Christianity, 
formed as supposed from the name of Christ with a German ending 
appended.
Along with others of such names, it seems to have 
remained in French use, and to have come over to us with the 
Normans.
I think then that I have succeeded to some extent in shewing 
that the place-names of these two counties reveal to us some things 
on which history is silent, and shew us in particular that at an 
unknown, though no doubt early period, this district was in the 
possession of a Scandinavian people, who have left behind them 
marks which we cannot doubt.
It was principally, in the first 
instance, upon the evidence of its place-names that this theory was 
based, but since then inscription after inscription has turned up 
written in Scandinavian runes, to add their testimony to the fact 
that there was a time when the language that was spoken in this 
district was Scandinavian.
And bye and bye, when the scientific 
and systematic investigation which philology has inaugurated into 
the origin of English dialects shall have borne its full fruits, it will, 
I doubt not, be made apparent that the language which is spoken 
by our people owes a considerable part of its idiom to the Scan- 
dinavian north.

WATER SUPPLY IN THE CARLISLE BASIN.
By T.
V. HOLMES, F.G.S.
I HAVE nothing to say in this paper about water supply in 
connection with the rivers and brooks of this district, the quantity 
and quality of their waters.
In these days of the rapid increase 
of population and manufacturing industry, it is well that each 
important town should have its attention called to any means of 
procuring a supply of pure water which the geological structure of 
the neighbourhood may afford, apart from its streams.
And the 
letter of a writer in the Carlisle Journal, of March 23rd, mentioning 
the existence of a salt spring at Kelsick Moss, and asking its cause, 
inclined me to think, while writing a brief reply, that this water 
question is well fitted to be the subject of a short paper on this 
occasion.
Having elsewhere described the rocks of the Carlisle Basin,* 
I will here treat of their nature and arrangement only so far as the 
subject now before us requires.
These rocks, as regards water- 
supply, primarily divide themselves into two distinct groups ; the 
superficial beds, consisting of glacial drift, peat, and alluvium, which 
cover the surface, and the Permian, Triassic, and Liassic rocks 
beneath them.
The arrangement and distribution of these two 
groups are perfectly distinct, the underlying rocks having definitely 
restricted areas, while the glacial drift and other superficial beds

may be found almost everywhere, and rest indifferently on any of 
the underlying rocks.
Thus, the Glacial Drift may afford an" 
equally good supply for the shallow wells of farmhouses, whether 
the underlying rock is of Carboniferous, Permian, or Liassic age.
But water in quantity sufficient to supply a city like Carlisle could 
only be obtained from wells penetrating not only the Glacial 
Drift, but more or less of the underlying rocks.
And the possi- 
bility of getting water from these lower beds in any given spot, 
depends on their nature, arrangement, and distribution.
The surface of the ground in Cumberland bordering the Solway 
is most persistently covered with Glacial Drift or other superficial 
beds, so that the amount of visible rock of Permian, Triassic, or 
Liassic age is extremely small, and almost confined to the banks 
or beds of the rivers.
Even along the rivers these lower beds may 
be very slightly exposed, sections in them such as those in the 
Eden at Wetheral, Shalk Beck above East Curthwaite, or the Lyne 
above Cliff Bridge, Kirklinton, are very seldom met with.
The 
full thickness of the Glacial Drift is not often shown in railway 
cuttings.
Journeys, for example, from CarUsle to Silloth, Wigton, 
Wreay, Wetheral, Longtown, or Gretna, take us through cuttings 
from twenty to thirty feet in depth, but in none of them is anything 
seen, on the most careful inspection, but superficial sand, gravel, 
and clay.
And though the farms and villages of this part of Cum- 
berland are almost invariably supplied with water from shallow 
wells in the Glacial Drift, well-sinkers are very careful to avoid 
penetrating to the lower rocks, as water attained on getting to a 
clayey stratum in the Drift might be lost on sinking through it and 
reaching a porous sandstone below.
The Glacial Drift is of very 
various composition.
It usually makes a light rather than a heavy 
soil, being, on the whole, much more gravelly than clayey.
But 
at various levels seams of clayey material exist, which hold up 
much of the water falling on the surface as rain, and allow of a 
great number of shallow wells.
Scarcely any rain can fall directly 
on the underlying rocks, the only considerable space almost or 
quite free from drift being a piece of country, a Uttle more than a 
square mile in area, between Aspatria and West Newton.
But as 
19 
clayey seams in the Drift are often very thin and variable, and 
probably absent altogether in certain places, much of the rainfall, 
no doubt, gets down to the underlying rocks sooner or later.
The 
greatest thickness known to be attained by the Glacial Drift is one 
hundred and ninety-eight feet six inches, in a boring at Kelsick 
Moss.
At Bowness on Solway its thickness was forty-one feet ; 
at Lynehow, below Westlinton, thirty-six feet three inches ; at 
Garlands Lunatic Asylum, twenty-eight feet.
In these figures a 
variable amount of soil, etc., is included.
It will be noticed that 
the thickness at Kelsick Moss is quite exceptional, the average of 
the three other borings being about thirty-five feet.
And the 
absence of the underlying rocks in the various railway cuttings 
near Carlisle points to a thickness of Glacial Drift that may exceed 
an average of thirty-five feet, but can hardly fall short of it.
And 
while at Kelsick Moss the beds to a depth of ninety-two feet are 
chiefly sandy or gravelly, the Drift thence to one hundred and 
ninety-eight feet six inches (the bottom) is mainly clayey.
But at 
Garlands the twenty-eight feet of Drift is made up of twenty-six 
feet sand and gravel above, and two feet of clay beneath.
We 
may now turn from the Glacial Drift and its shallow wells to the 
underlying rocks of Permian, Triassic, and Liassic age, and their 
water-bearing capacities.
The lowest bed of the Carlisle Basin is the St. Bees Sandstone.
It occupies (below more or less Drift) a belt of country of variable 
breadth between Maryport and Allonby, north of Aspatria, south 
of Wigton, around Dalston, Wetheral, and Brampton.
North of 
Brampton it may be seen in the Hether Burn near Hethersgill, 
the Lyne about the Muckle Linn, above Kirklinton Hall, and the 
Esk above Scots Dyke railway bridge.
In Dumfriesshire it is 
visible about Kirkpatrick, Annan, and at Tordoff Point on the 
Solway.
The dip of the St. Bees Sandstone is northerly between 
Maryport and Dalston (on the south), more westerly about 
Wetheral and Brampton, south-westerly from the Hether Burn to 
the Esk, and southerly on the Scottish side of the Border.
And 
there can be no doubt that could we see the dip of the St. Bees 
Sandstone on the western side of the Basin (now beneath the 
20 
Solvvay), we should find it easterly between Annan and AUonby.
We have thus in this area a complete basin.
On its outer rim the 
St. Bees Sandstone may be seen at heights of one hundred, two 
hundred, or even three hundred feet above the sea ; while in its 
centre, that is, along a line ranging approximately from Abbey 
Town, through Aikton and Stainton to Westlinton, it is many 
hundreds of feet below.
Consequently all the water percolating 
through it tends to make its way towards the centre of the basin.
At Kelsick Moss, near Abbey Town, a boring proves the 
existence of about seven hundred feet of shales with gypsum below 
the one hundred and ninety-eight feet six inches of Glacial Drift 
already mentioned.
Below these Gypseous Shales about one 
hundred feet of St. Bees Sandstone were pierced before the boring 
ended.
These Gypseous Shales are known to exist solely from 
borings.
At Bowness three hundred and sixty-seven feet of 
Gypseous Shales were found overlying "red stone," in all proba- 
bility St. Bees Sandstone, in which the boring ended.
And the 
record of an old boring made in the year 1781 by John Brisco of 
Crofton, near the village of Great Orton, and probably on its 
north-west side, states that below blue rock (evidently Liassic), 
"red stone or clay sometimes mixed with veins of white," was 
found, at a depth of two hundred and twenty-eight feet below the 
surface.
The boring ended after this material had been proved to 
attain a thickness of one hundred and thirty-two feet.
How much 
thicker it may have been is unknown.
North-east of Great Orton, 
or, as I may say, in the north-eastern half of the Carlisle Basin, 
these Gypseous Shales give no evidence of their existence.
North 
of the Lias area there is no evidence of anything but Drift between 
Bowness and Rockcliffe.
South of the Lias one might expect to 
see Gypseous Shales at Cummersdale, in the banks of the Caldew.
But both at Rockcliffe and at Cummersdale the rock seen is the 
Kirklinton Sandstone.
This sandstone, in the north-eastern half 
of the Carlisle Basin, directly overlies that of St. Bees.
We may now consider the probable reason of this disappearance 
of the Gypseous Shales.
The rock which directly overlies the 
St. Bees Sandstone in the N.E.
— the Kirklinton Sandstone — is 
21 
clearly unconformable to the rocks beneath.
In other words, the 
St. Bees Sandstone and Gypseous Shales had evidently been planed 
down by denudation before the Kirklinton Sandstone was deposited 
above them.
This denudation appears to have been greater towards 
the N.E. end of the Basin than about the centre.
Thus, while at 
Great Orton one hundred and thirty-two feet or more of the 
Gypseous Shales were left, at Netherby not only were the Gypseous 
Shales swept away, but much of the St. Bees Sandstone also.
This 
unconformity may therefore be a sufficient reason for the non- 
appearance of the Gypseous Shales at Cummersdale.
But, in 
addition, a fault known to exist between Brackenbank on the 
Eden and Newbiggin on the Petteril, is probably prolonged 
westward of the Caldew about Dalston Hall.
This fault having a 
downthrow to the north, the beds on its northern side, along its 
course, are geologically higher than those on the southern.
There- 
fore a prolongation of this fault across the Caldew Valley at Dalston 
Hall, and (below the Lias) towards Great Orton, would cut off 
the Gypseous Shales along its line, and bring in the Kirklinton 
Sandstone on its northern side.
And as the Kirklinton Sandstone 
rapidly thickens as we approach Carlisle from Cummersdale, 
wells of considerable depth in or near the Border City give no 
information about any beds below that rock.
Consequently we 
do not know how far the Gypseous Shales maintain their existence 
towards Beaumont and Carlisle, beneath the Kirklinton Sandstone, 
before they die away.
It is evident, however, that they must die away long before the 
northern end of the Basin is reached.
This is shown not only by 
the fact that in the Hether Burn, the Lyne, and the Esk the Kirk- 
linton Sandstone rests directly on that of St. Bees, but by the 
boring at Lynehow, formerly Justustovvn, on the river Lyne about 
a mile below Westlinton.
At Lynehow about one hundred and 
seventy feet of Kirklinton Sandstone rested on an unknown thick- 
ness of St. Bees.
The two sandstones are easily distinguishable 
from each other, not only in sections of any size, but, usually, even 
in hand specimens.
The lower beds of the Kirklinton Sandstone 
are mainly bright red, and the rock generally is very false-bedded.
The upper beds are mainly whitish or light gray.
The lower beds 
may be well seen at Cliff Bridge, Kirklinton, the upper at Skew- 
bank, Grinsdale.
Above the Kirklinton Sandstone, and resting partly on its lower 
red beds and partly on its upper white ones, is a formation known 
as the Stanwix Marls,* which form the base of the cliff called 
Etterby Scar.
These Stanwix Marls and Shales are usually red or 
greenish-grey in colour, and they occupy (below the Drift) a 
compact area between the rivers Lyne and Eden, from Beaumont 
to Westlinton on the one hand, and Cliff Bridge, Kirklinton, to 
Stanwix on the other.
They probably attain their greatest thickness 
about Harker.
But their thickness, though probably inconsiderable, 
is unknown.
Their extension, south of the Eden, appears to be 
very slight.
The patch of Lias south of the Eden consists of alternations of 
shale and limestone, which, near Great Orton, attain a thickness 
of two hundred and ten feet.
It extends from Bellevue on the 
east to Aikton on the west, from Kirkbampton on the north to 
Wiggonby on the south.
We have thus in the Carlisle Basin the highly permeable 
formation the St. Bees Sandstone at the bottom.
It rests, in its 
turn, unconformably, on rocks of Carboniferous age, themselves 
partly permeable and partly impermeable.
But as the St. Bees 
Sandstone tends to become somewhat shaly towards its base, it is 
not probable that any great quantity of the water in it sinks 
through to the Carboniferous rocks below.
Above the St. Bees 
Sandstone lie the Gypseous Shales, in the south-western half of 
the Carlisle Basin, at least.
The Gypseous Shales must be, as a 
mass, impermeable.
Thirdly, we have the Kirklinton Sandstone.
This rock probably rests on the Gypseous Shales for a short 
distance in the centre of the Basin, and certainly on the St. Bees 
Sandstone in the north-east.
It is, of course, highly permeable.
On the Kirklinton Sandstone lie the Stanwix Marls and Shales 
which belong to the impermeable division.
And, resting in all 
*See the article on "The Penrith Sandstone," by Mr, Goodchild, in the 
Carlisle Journal, the Patriot, &c., August, l88o.
23 
probability partly on the Gypseous Shales, partly on the Kirklinton 
Sandstone and Slanwix Marls, we have the bands of limestone and 
shale belonging to the Lias formation.
The limestones are more 
or less permeable, and the shales impermeable.
It must be evident that an artesian well would be sunk to most 
advantage along a line ranging through the centre of the Basin ; 
in other words, from Abbey Town through Aikton, Orton, and 
Grinsdale to Westlinton.
For along this line we might expect to 
find the St. Bees Sandstone containing the largest quantity of 
water.
The salt spring at Kelsick Moss, near Abbey Town, 
evidently derives its water from the St. Bees Sandstone at the 
bottom of the borehole, about one hundred feet of that rock having 
been pierced, But the salt and other saline ingredients are as 
evidently derived from the overlying Gypseous Shales through 
which the borehole passes.
Salt and gypsum are both deposited, 
under certain conditions, as chemical precipitates in lakes, and are 
often, perhaps usually, found associated together, as in this case.
Proceeding eastward along this central line, it is doubtful at what 
depth St. Bees Sandstone would be found about Great Orton.
I 
have already stated that the Lias was found to be two hundred 
and ten feet thick in the old boring, and I may add that the 
thickness of the drift at the surface was eighteen feet.
But though 
at Great Orton we have the Lias formation in addition to the 
Gypseous Shales, it is probable that the Drift and Gypseous Shales 
are both so much thinner at Orton than at Abbey Town, as to 
bring the top of the St. Bees Sandstone much nearer the surface 
at the first-named than at the latter place.
For, instead of nearly 
two hundred feet of Drift and seven hundred feet of Gypseous 
Shales, at Great Orton we may have an average of perhaps thirty 
feet of Drift, above two hundred and ten feet of Lias, and two 
hundred feet or less of Gypseous Shales.
Of course this estimate 
of the thickness of the Gypseous Shales is only a conjecture, but 
they must thin away very rapidly towards the centre and the east 
of the Basin.
Still going eastward we enter the region in which 
the Kirklinton Sandstone underlies the Lias, and before reaching 
the Eden at Grinsdale the northern outcrop of the Lias is passed.

At Grinsdale we see at Skewbank, the river-cliff on the right bank 
of the Eden, the upper beds of the Kirklinton Sandstone.
At the 
bend of the river between Grinsdale Church and Skewbank the 
word " Spa Well " may be seen on the Ordnance Map (6in.
to the 
mile).
At Spa Well, water is seen oozing out of a borehole, and 
the following is an abstract of the section, for which I am indebted 
to Mr. R.
Russell : — 
Soil, Sand, and Gravel ...
- 
Blue, Brown, and Red Metal (Stanwix Marls) 
Kirklinton ( Sandstone White and Grey, with partings 
Sandstone ( Red Sandstone with partings (left off in) 
A fault of no great size or consequence may be seen on the 
eastern side of Skewbank.
The Kirklinton Sandstone at Skewbank 
and Grinsdale Church consists of an inlier a few acres in area, and 
on all sides surrounded by Stanwix Marls ; its shape is that of a 
low dome.
It will have been noticed that the Stanwix Marls are 
only twenty-three feet thick in the borehole, but its position is too 
near the sandstone inlier to be any guide to the thickness of the 
Marls as they may be even a few yards eastward.
The sandstone 
in the boring is evidently all Kirklinton Sandstone, and, judging 
from the thickness of red stone noted in the lower beds at many 
places, that formation may attain at Skewbank a thickness of five 
hundred and fifty or six hundred feet, perhaps more.
We have no 
means of ascertaining whether the Gypseous Shales still continue 
to exist about Grinsdale beneath the Kirklinton Sandstone.
Con- 
tinuing our journey towards Westlinton, we find that at Lynehow 
the Kirklinton Sandstone rests directly on that of St. Bees.
As 
nearly as could be ascertained from an examination of the boring 
cores, one hundred and seventy feet of red Kirklinton Sandstone 
overlie an unknown thickness of St. Bees, at Lynehow.
The total 
depth of the borehole was two hundred and seventy-six feet six 
inches, and water rose in it to about nine feet from the surface.* 
* According to Mr. R.
Russell, to whom I am indebted for information 
about this borehole.
2b 
The sketch map appended to my paper on the Carlisle Basin 
(Q.J.G.S. 1881) will show that the Kirklinton Sandstone may well 
be much thicker at Skevvbank than at Lynehovv, apart from the 
fact that it j^robably suffered less from denudation before the 
deposition of the Stanwix Marls at the former than at the latter 
place.
For Skevvbank is much nearer the centre of the Basin.
Probably the best place for a deep artesian well in this district 
would be the neighbourhood of Harker, between Carlisle and 
Westlinton.
It is true that at Harker the Stanwix Marls would 
have to be pierced as well as the Kirklinton Sandstone.
But as 
the Stanwix Marls occupy the centre of the Basin, a larger supply 
of water would be met with beneath them than on either side.
Any estimate of the thickness of the Stanwix Marls at Harker can 
be but a conjecture; but what is seen of them seems to me to point 
to the view that the hollow in which they lie is but a shallow one, 
and that the Kirklinton Sandstone is at least as likely to be found 
at a depth of less than a hundred feet, as at one greater.
While 
below the marls we have, in all probability, simply the two thick 
sandstones of St. Bees and Kirklinton, the latter resting directly 
on the former, and their united thicknesses amounting to fifteen 
hundred feet or more.
It would be impossible to mention any 
part of the British Isles of similar extent in which the geological 
construction of the district more decidedly favours water supply by 
means of deep artesian wells than does that of the Carlisle Basin.
And it would be almost equally difficult to exaggerate the superi- 
ority in quality of water so obtained over that now drawn from 
the beautiful but not unpolluted Eden.

GRAPTOLITES OF THE SKIDDAW SLATES.
By J, POSTLETHWAITE, F.G.S, 
(Read at the Ambleside Meeting.) 
The name Graptolite, or Graptolithus, is derived from two Greek 
words — GraJ>ho, I write, and Lithos, stone.
It was first made use 
of by Linnaeus, in describing a fossil of a somewhat doubtful 
character, but which bears a strong resemblance to the family of 
Graptolites.
A drawing of this fossil, which was called by Linnxus 
Graptolithus scalaris, appeared in a work published by him in 1 75 1.
It appears, however, to represent not one, but three distinct organ- 
isms, and their identity with any known species has not been 
clearly established.
Linnaeus also described a well known Grapto- 
lite, which he named Graptolithus Sagittarius.
I believe Sir Roderick Murchison was the first English author 
who wrote on these fossils.
In his Silurian System, published in 
1839, is figured three species, namely, Graptolites ludensis, 
G. viurchisotii, and G.
foliaceus, and he was among the first to 
recognise the importance of Graptolites as Silurian fossils.
General Portlock, in his Geological Report on LondondeiTy, 
Tyrone, and Fermanagh, published in 1843, noticed their affinity 
to the Hydroid Zoophytes.
He regarded them as being very 
nearly allied to Sertularia (Figs, i and la) and Pluraularia (Fig. 2) 
which are to be found in large numbers on our coasts.
In 1848 Professor Sedgwick announced that Graptolites had 
been found in the Skiddaw Slates; and the discovery of these 
fossils in the south of Scotland by Mr. Salter, and in North Wales 
38 
by Professor Phillips, was also made known about the same time.
In the preceding year, 1847, Mr. John Ruthven of Kendal was 
sent into the neighbourhood of Keswick by Professor Sedgwick, 
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Skiddaw Slate Rocks 
were really fossiliferous or not.
He had a tent pitched on 
Skiddaw, near the White Stones, and he continued working there 
for a week or more.
I endeavoured to obtain an account of that 
expedition, and its results, but failed to do so.
I believe, however, 
that Mr. Joseph Graham of Keswick had the honour of being the 
first to discover Graptolites in the Skiddaw Slates, and in all 
probability it was to test the genuineness of his discoveries that 
Mr. Ruthven was engaged in 1847.
There are about two hundred and fifty species of British 
Graptolites known, and of these forty have been found in the 
Skiddaw Slates.
They consist of leaf-like, or branching, grass-like 
bodies, or the impression of those bodies, left in the stone in which 
they have been enclosed.
There is much variety of form amongst 
them, although all bear the common family likeness in their 
general structure.
Those fossilized forms are the remains of 
chitinous or horny cases once inhabited by composite organisms, 
or they may be described as colonies of semi-independent creatures; 
which, when living, must have had a very marked resemblance, in 
many points, to the Sertularian Zoophytes that inhabit our seas 
at the present time.
Their general form consisted of one or more 
rows of horny cups or cellules, attached to a tube or common 
canal, into which they probably opened by a narrow aperture at 
their bases.
The common canal was also composed of the same 
horny substance.
Generally the whole structure called the 
" polypary," was based upon a slender rod of the same material, 
which often projected beyond both ends of the common body, in 
young members, but the distal prolongation was less frequent in 
those of mature growth.
Each portion of the polypary fulfilled its own office.
The rod 
that formed the foundation or back-bone of the structure is called 
the "axis" (Fig. 3) ; it consisted of a slender fibrous cylinder, 
extending along the side of the common canal, opposite that on

which the cellules were placed.
It is probable that this slender 
cylinder contained a minute portion of the body of the organism, 
as it appears to have possessed the power of growing independently 
of the general body, and in some cases to have extended a 
considerable distance beyond each end of it.
This vital part of 
the axis, if such existed, does not appear to have had any 
connection with the general body, in the common canal, and 
could not derive nourishment therefrom.
The chief function of 
the axis was no doubt to give stability to the polypary.
The "common canal" (Fig. 4), in which the "ccenosarc" or 
general body was enclosed, consisted of a tube formed of horny 
material.
On one side of this tube, in single Graptolites, was 
placed the axis, generally outside the tube ; and on the opposite 
side were the cellules containing the Zooids.
The "cellules" (Fig. 5) were small cups formed of the same 
horny substance as the other parts of the polypary, and were 
placed side by side, along the common canal.
Except in one or 
two forms, the cellules do not spring vertically from the common 
canal, but are inclined, at various angles, towards the upper, or 
distal end ; and thus each cellule overlaps its neighbour to a 
- certain extent.
Until quite recently, the opinion held generally by palaeontolo- 
gists respecting the structure of all forms of Graptolites, was that 
the cellules opened full into the common canal, and that the 
ccenosarc was a continuous body throughout the entire length of the 
common canal.
A structure differing from this was first observed 
by Professor McCoy, who in describing a Graptolite from the 
Skiddaw Slates, to which he gave the name of Graptolites latiis, 
speaks of "transverse diaphragms" being present near the base of 
the cellules.
This appeared in his British Palceozoic Fossils, 1854.
No additional light was brought to bear on this peculiar structure, 
until Mr. William Kinsey Dover of Keswick directed the attention 
of Mr. Hopkinson to some specimens in his collection, which 
show not only that each cellule was cut off from the common 
canal by a clearly-marked septum, but that the common canal was 
also divided by transverse septa between each cellule (Fig. 6).
40 
Mr. Hopkinson prepared a paper specially on this subject, and 
read it before the British Association at York on the 7th of 
of September, 1881.
This paper appeared, in an abridged form, 
in the Geological Magazine for October, 1881, and in the Annals 
and Magazine of Natural History for January, 1882.
Mr. Hop- 
kinson does not suppose that the cellules were entirely cut off 
from the common canal, or that the division of the coenosarc into 
sections was complete, he speaks of the septa as strictures.
Professor 
Lapworth also speaks of them in the same way ; he compares the 
septa to the hard joints in reeds or tall stems of grass, by which 
they are divided into sections, a minute aperture only being left for 
the passage of nourishment.
When Graptolites were living organisms, there can be no doubt 
that each cellule contained a zooid, which was connected, however 
slightly, with the general body; and that this zooid, like the 
Sertularian Zoophytes of the present time, would be furnished with 
tentacles or arms, for the purpose of securing its food.
Also 
that it would probably possess the power to protrude its head 
beyond the mouth of the cellule, when necessary, and retire 
altogether within it when an enemy approached.
The form of the cell-mouth, so far as it can be ascertained, was 
usually round, and it opened generally in the direction of the 
cellule, but in some cases obliquely, and in others it was so bent 
as to open directly towards tjie base or proximal end of the 
polypary (Fig. 7).
The most simple classification of the Graptolite family is that 
adopted by Professor Nicholson, according to whom the true 
Graptolites are divided into three groups, namely, the Monoprio- 
nidian group, or forms with a single row of cellules; the 
Diprionidian group, with two rows of cellules ; and the Tetraprio- 
nidian group, with four rows of cellules.
There is also another 
group, the Dendroidea, which consists of much-branched and 
plant-like forms.
Amongst the forms of which the true nature js 
doubtful, but which occur in the same beds, and bear more or less 
likeness to the Graptolite family are here placed under the heading 
41 
Incerta sedis.
I believe Thamnograptus doveri is the only species 
known in the Skiddaw Slates.
These groups are further divided into genera, and the genera 
into species ; but in the limited time allotted to me I shall only be 
able to describe two or three of the species in each genus.
MONOPRIONIDIAN GROUP.
Azygograptus.
— I believe there is only one species of this genus 
known, namely, A.
lapworthi (Fig. 8).
It consists of a simple 
monoprionidian polypary or stipe, which attains its full width close 
to the proximal end.
The stipe is usually long and slender, and 
the portion occupied by the common body larger than in many of 
the monoprionidian forms.
The cellules are broad, numbering 
about twenty in the space of an inch.
Azygograpti occur very 
plentifully at Hodgson Howe Quarry, near Portinscale, and some 
specimens have been found at Barf.
The rock in which the 
fossils are found at Hodgson Howe is of a hard gritty nature, 
occurring in a series of thin beds interstratified with soft slate.
The latter does not appear to have been suitable for the preser- 
vation of the Azygograpti, as I believe that none have been found 
in it hitherto ; but the gritty beds contain large quantities, often 
matted together like tufts of grass.
The genus Didymograptus comprises forms that consist of two 
monoprionidian stipes springing from an initial point, which is 
frequently marked by a distinct spine, called the "radicle." This 
initial point, although it forms the base of the organism, is some- 
times so small as to be scarcely discernible.
The cellules usually 
occupy the side of the stipe opposite the radicle, but in some cases 
they are on the same side.
D. tiitidus (Fig. 9) is the most 
common species of this genus, indeed, they have been so numerous 
in some localities, that stones are occasionally found covered with 
a matted network of their fossilized remains.
The two stipes 
spring horizontally from the radicle, they are narrow at the base, 
and widen very gradually towards the extremities, which are often 
somewhat rounded, owing apparently to the imperfect development 
of two or three of the last cellules.
The widest parts of the stipes 
42 
usually measure about one-tenth, and the narrowest about one- 
twentieth of an inch ; and about one-sixth of the width is occupied 
by the common body.
The cellules number from thirty to thirty- 
four to the inch.
These are the dimensions of an average adult ; 
but the stipes vary in length from one-eighth of an inch, in very 
young members, to nearly a foot.
In large specimens the stipes 
measure an eighth of an inch or more in width.
Didymograptus patulus differs from D.
nitidus in the form of the 
cellules, which are curved, and in the proportion of the stipe 
occupied by the common body being somewhat larger.
Didymograptus extensus resembles D.
tiitidus and D.
patulus 
in general form, but the stipes are narrower, being not more than 
one-fiftieth of an inch in width at the narrowest part, and one- 
twentieth of an inch at the widest.
The cellules are short and 
broad, numbering about twenty-four to the inch.
Didymograptus gibberulus (Fig. lo) resembles the last three in 
having two stipes with a single row of cellules, but differs from 
them in general form.
The stipes spring horizontally from the 
radicle, then curve backwards, until the complete form resembles 
the letter U inverted.
The cellules are very narrow, numbering 
about forty to the inch ; and in some cases they are furnished with 
long spines.
The stipes are unusually broad compared with their 
length.
The genus Didymograptus is found only in Lower Silurian strata 
in Britain, and in strata of the same age in America, in the 
former it occurs almost exclusively in the Skiddaw Slates and the 
Llandeilo rocks.
The genus Tetragraptus comprises forms consisting of four 
monoprionidian stipes, connected by a non-celluUferous rod or 
"funicle." They resemble two Didymograpti connected at their 
bases, the combined radicles forming the non-celluliferous funicle 
which connects the four stipes.
In the species Tetragraptus bryonides (Fig. ii), the connecting 
funicle is of variable length ; and from its centre, in some cases, 
proceeds a minute pointed radicle.
The stipes diverge at various 
43 
angles ; they are narrow in their origin, but expand abruptly and 
attain their full width in a distance of three or four cellules.
The 
distal extremities of the stipes are also abruptly rounded.
The genus Tetragraptus occurs only in the Skiddaw Slates in 
Britain, and in Canadian rocks commonly regarded as of the same 
age.
The genus Dichograptus comprises forms consisting of eight or 
more monoprionidian stipes united at the centre by a funicle, which 
gives off two branches at each end, these are again subdivided.
Both the funicle and its subdivisions are generally, though not 
always, enveloped in a thin corneous disc, or float, which often 
extends a short distance along each stipe.
The portion of the 
stipes enclosed within the disc is always non-celluliferous.
When 
the disc is not present, the cellules usually commence on each 
stipe, near the point of junction with its neighbour.
Dichograptus octobrachiatus (Fig. 12) consists of forms having 
eight monoprionidian stipes, united in the usual way, and a central 
disc is present in most cases.
Within the disc, or near it, the 
stipes are about one-twentieth of an inch in width, in full grown 
members ; beyond this the width, including the cellules, is about 
one-eighth of an inch, and the common body occupies about one- 
third of the entire width.
The largest members of this species 
measure as much as eighteen or twenty inches across, each stipe 
being half that length ; and if they possessed in the central disc 
the power to float or to sink at pleasure, as it is supposed, they 
must have presented a very strange appearance on the surface of 
the water.
I have in my collection two species that have not been described 
or named, and which for the present I will call No. i and No. 2.
No. I consists of four monoprionidian stipes, two of which spring 
horizontally from a central point, curve slightly upward, and then 
go off at an angle of eighty-five degrees.
At the end of the curve, 
each stipe throws off a branch on the inner side (Fig. 13).
The 
stipes are about an inch and a half in length, and one-twelfth of 
an inch in width at the widest part, and are celluliferous on their 
44 
inner margins.
Four specimens of this species have been found 
at Carlside Edge, on Skiddaw, two by Mr. P.
Harrison of Keswick, 
and two by myself None of the specimens are in a good state of 
preservation, but I am the fortunate possessor of the best.
Mr.
Hall, in his work on " The Graptolites of the Quebec Group," has 
figured and described a species named GraptoUthus fncticosus, to 
which the specimens found at Carlside Edge bear some resem- 
blance ; but in the latter, there is no trace of the large pointed 
radicle which forms the base of the organism in G.
fruticosus.
Species No. 2 is, I believe, quite new to Science.
It consists of 
a funicle giving off three short branches at each end.
The funicle 
measures about one-tenth of an inch, and the longest branch, or 
stipe, does not exceed one-fifth of an inch in length.
The cellules 
are rather indistinct (Fig. 14).
There are seven perfect, and four 
or five imperfect specimens of this diminutive species on one small 
slab of Skiddaw Slate, which I found at Randel Crag, on the 
north-western side of Skiddaw summit.
All the perfect specimens 
are of precisely the same form, with a slight variation in size ; and 
if further research should prove that they are young individuals in 
an incomplete state of development, they may still be regarded as 
representatives of a new species, as I believe none have been 
found hitherto that are branched in this peculiar way.* 
I must leave the remaining monoprionidian genera unnoticed, 
and pass on to describe a few members of the 
DiPRioNiDiAN Group.
This group comprises forms that have two rows of cellules.
Their structure will be readily understood by supposing that two 
monoprionidian stipes are united back to back, the axis running 
along the centre of the wall that separates the two common 
bodies.
Diplograptus pristiniforinis is a typical specimen of the genus.
It consists of a flattened stipe having a row of cellules on each 
side, also a well-defined axis running through the whole length.
* 1 have since ascertained that Mr. Christopherson of Keswick has in his 
collection an adult member of this species.
45 
The axis projects slightly beyond the proximal end, and often to 
a considerable distance beyond the distal end of the celluliferous 
portion of the stipe.
The stipe is narrow at the base, but expands 
gradually until it attains the full width, which is about one-tenth of 
an inch.
The cellules are narrow and closely arranged, numbering 
about twenty-eight in the space of an inch, and they terminate 
abruptly at the distal end of the stipe (Fig. 15).
The genus Climacograptus also comprises forms that have two 
rows of cellules, but it differs from Diplographis prisiiniformis in 
the shape of the cellules, which are so bent towards the distal end 
of the stipe, that the outer position of each becomes parallel with 
the axis ; the cell-mouth being sunk within the margin of the stipe, 
and completely sheltered by the next cellule.
Climacograptus atitennarius is a typical specimen of this genus.
It consists of a short double-celled stipe about an eighth of an inch 
in width, having a strong axis, which often extends beyond the 
distal end, as much as the entire length of the celluliferous portion 
of the stipe ; it also projects slightly beyond the proximal end.
Moreover, the base of the stipe is furnished with two strong spines, 
one on each side, diverging at an angle of about sixty degrees.
The cellules are bent upward, and their mouths depressed below 
the margin of the stipe (Fig. 1 6).
The vertical range of the genus Diplograptus extends from the 
Skiddaw Slates, through the Llandeilo and Caradoc rocks ; and 
Climacograptus ranges through the same strata into the Lower 
Llandovery beds.
Tetraprionidian Group.
This group consists of forms having four rows of cellules, or 
they may be described as four monoprionidian stipes placed back 
to back, having an axis running through the centre, and projecting 
slightly at the base.
Phyllograptus typus is the most common of the Tetraprionidian 
forms.
The stipes are usually short and broad, the general shape 
being an elongated oval.
A strongly marked axis is always present.
46 
The cellules number about thirty-four to the inch ; in some cases 
they are slightly curved, and they are generally furnished with 
slender spines, which project from their lower lips (Fig. 17).
The fossil remains of P.
typus appear on the stone as simple 
leaf-like forms, two stipes being usually pressed together on each 
side, but in some rare instances they have been found showing two 
stipes in a horizontal, and two in a vertical position.
P. angustifolius resembles P.
typus in general structure, but the 
stipes are narrower and more elongated.
They also differ from 
P. typus in being broadest near the base, from which they expand 
rapidly until they attain their greatest width, and then taper very 
gradually towards the distal end.
The mouths of the cellules are 
furnished with long slender spines, which curve towards the base.
The genus Phyllograptiis is exclusively confined to the Skiddaw 
Slates in Britain, and to the Quebec Group in Canada.
The section Dendroidea embraces forms that are branching 
and plant-like in their structure, and it is doubtful whether or not 
they ought to be regarded as true Graptolites.
Professor Nichol- 
son, in his "British Graptolitidae," has tabulated one species as 
occurring in the Skiddaw Slates, namely, Dendrograptus hallianus.
It is exceedingly plant-like in form, the branches spring from a 
parent stem, and are divided and subdivided until it assumes the 
appearance of a miniature tree.
Both branches and branchlets 
are celluliferous on one side, but unlike the true Graptolites, they 
do not show any trace of an axis, while the parent stem is furnished 
with a distinct root-bulb, which renders it more than probable that 
they were fixed to the bottom of the sea (Fig. 18).
Section Incert^ Sedis embraces forms consisting of straight or 
slightly winding stipes, from which branches spring alternately on 
each side.
Both main stipe and branches show a central depressed 
line representing an axis, but there is no trace of cellules.
None 
of the members of this section were known to occur in the Skiddaw 
Slates until 1875, when Mr. Dover found one that has been figured 
and named Thamnograptus doveri.
It consists of a slightly un- 
dulating central stipe, giving off lateral branches on each side.
It 
47 
is a very beautiful and perfect specimen ; the central stipe is about 
two inches long, and it gives off five branches on the right, and 
four on the left side, all of them clearly and distinctly marked — 
the fossilized corneous substance being in an excellent state of 
preservation (Fig. 19).
Reproduction.
The mode of reproduction in the Graptolite family is somewhat 
obscure, but in all probability it was analogous to that of the 
Sertularian Zoophytes.
In the latter, ovarian capsules are devel- 
oped on the sides of the stipe, resembling the flower buds of a 
plant.
The capsules are generally somewhat larger than the 
hydrothecae or cellules, and the reproductive Zooids are developed 
in the interior.
These undergo a series of transformations, but 
remain in permanent connexion with the colony.
On the contrary, 
the ovarian capsules of the Graptolites appear to have become 
detached in the later stages of their growth, and afterwards to have 
opened and set free the germs of life within.
Professor Nicholson 
states, in his " British Graptolitidse," that he has in his collection 
specimens of Graptolites sedgioickii that show minute pear-shaped 
sacs attached to some of the cellules.
Also, that he has other 
specimens showing sacs or capsules of the same shape, but much 
enlarged, and in a free state.
Those free capsules are found 
amongst the Graptolites, and are composed of the same horny 
substance.
There is reason to suppose that each of the ovarian 
capsules, like those of the Sertularians, may have contained quite 
a host of little germs or " siculas," from which in every species of 
the Graptolite family, the adult forms have been developed.
The 
sicula has a pointed triangular, or dagger-like shape, without axis 
or cellules ; at a later stage, a- minute axis appears, either on one 
side or along the centre, and more advanced forms exhibit two or 
three small ceUules on one or both sides of the wider end of the 
sicula, according as the form may be monoprionidian, diprionidian, 
or tetraprionidian.
It is impossible, however, to determine to 
which species the young form belongs, except in those that have a 
few of the cellules developed.
Almost every species, in the early 
48 
stages of its development, seems to have been small and feeble, 
the proximal end of the stipe being somewhat attenuated, and the 
first cellules stunted in their growth ; but as the stipe increased in 
length, and successive cellules were budded, it acquired a fuller 
vitality, and both cellules and common canal attained their full 
development.
Neither the young nor the adult Graptolites appear to have been 
endowed with the power of locomotion.
It is true that some of 
them possessed in the central disc, an organ by which they may 
have been enabled to float or sink at pleasure, but there is no 
trace in any of their fossilized remains, of organs by vphich they 
could move from place to place.
If they were really furnished 
with such organs, they must have been of a membraneous nature, 
and, like the soft portions of their bodies, would perish and leave 
no trace behind.
It must also be remembered that Graptolites 
were composite organisms, consisting in some cases of from two to 
three thousand semi-independent zooids ; and we can scarcely 
imagine such numerous colonies acting in concert in reference to 
the direction in which they should travel.
The limited knowledge 
we possess respecting the habits of these interesting creatures, 
points to the conclusion that although they existed as free organ- 
isms, yet in all probability they performed the work assigned to 
them by a beneficent and all-wise Creator, and then died at the 
place which witnessed their birth.
It was otherwise with the 
members of the Trilobite family living at the same time ; they 
evidently possessed the power of moving freely from place to 
place, because solitary specimens may occasionally be met with 
anywhere in the Skiddaw Slate rocks ; but Graptolites were almost 
invariably congregated together, so that it may be said of them, 
as of the Sertularians, that "associated life was the rule, and 
solitary existence the rare exception." 
Preservation.
In reference to the preservation of the remains of these organ- 
isms, it would seem that the stipes have generally been crushed 
or flattened out, but in some cases the process of fossilization 
49 
has been completed before any great amount of pressure was 
applied ; and thus the forms were preserved in relief In the 
process of fossilization, the horny substance of which they were 
formed has been replaced either by some form of Carbon, or by 
Iron Pyrites.
The latter is the form in which Skiddaw Slate 
fossils are almost invariably found.
There is reason to believe that only a very small percentage of 
the Graptolites were fossilized ; the remainder would decay and 
become mixed with the mud at the bottom of the sea, and thus 
supply the carbon that forms one of the constituents of the rocks 
in which they are found.
Some of the slates and shales that yield 
Graptolites most plentifully, contain as much as five per cent, of 
carbon, perhaps derived from the decayed remains of these little 
creatures : indeed, some geologists have suggested that the dark 
colour and the anthracitic appearance of the most highly-fossiliferous 
beds may be due entirely to that cause.
There is yet need for active and zealous workers to assist in 
solving one of the most difficult problems connected with the 
geology of the Lake District, namely, to determine the true position 
of the Skiddaw Slates.
The late Mr. Ward, who laboured with so 
much enthusiasm in mapping the rocks of this district, cautiously 
refrained from a definite expression of opinion in his memoir of 
the " Geology of the Northern part of the Lake District," but 
quotes the opinions of Mr. Salter and Professor Nicholson, whose 
palaeontological researches led them to agree in placing the Skiddaw 
Slates on the same horizon as the Lower Llandeilo Rocks.
But 
in Mr. Ward's "Physical History of the Lake District," published 
a few years later, he states distinctly that, from physical and 
palaeontological evidence combined, he considers the Skiddaw 
Slates to be in part the equivalent to the Welsh Arenig Rocks; also 
that the Arenig Grits, Tremadoc Slates, and Lingula Flags are all 
represented in the lower part of the Skiddaw Slate Series.
Some 
geologists, however, dissent from Mr. Ward in regard to the last 
named stratum, while others disagree with him in reference to the 
relative positions occupied by the Skiddaw Slates and the Volcanic 
Series of Borrowdale, contending that the latter is an older, and 
4 
50 
not a more recent formation.
The real difficulty of the case arises 
from the fact that geologists have hitherto been unable to ascertain 
the character of the rocks upon which the Skiddaw Slates rest ; 
and so long as that question remains unsolved, the only reliable 
evidence available for determining their true position, is that 
afforded by the fossilized remains of life they contain.
And it 
will scarcely be necessary to inform my readers, that the more 
extensive and perfect the assemblage of fossils, the more conclusive 
will be the evidence to be derived therefrom.

Graptolites have been found in considerable numbers at Randal 
Crag, Barf, Carlside Edge, and Hodgson How Quarry ; but in all 
the other localities they are scarce, not more than one or two 
specimens having been obtained in many of the places named.
Collectors may, however, expect to find fossils wherever cleavage is 
undeveloped and the rock breaks up along the lines of bedding : 
but a protracted and diligent search will often prove unsuccessful.
In those places where cleavage has been partially developed, and 
the rock breaks into long pencil-like fragments, no fossils will be 
found, except in very rare cases; and it will be equally unprofitable 
to search amongst the beds of coarse grit which occur in some 
localities.

I feel it to be my duty to acknowledge with gratitude the kind 
assistance I have received from Mr. W.
Kinsey Dover, in the 
prosecution of my palseontological studies, and the generous 
freedom with which he has thrown open to me both his Hbrary 
and his unrivalled collection of Skiddaw Slate Fossils.
I must 
also add that valuable service has been rendered to the cause of 
science by the labours of Messrs.
C. Christopherson and P.
Harrison, of Keswick, who for many years have been industrious 
collectors of fossils.

THE PROPOSED PERMANENT LAKE DISTRICT 
DEFENCE SOCIETY.
(Read before the Wordsworth Society in the College Hall, Westminster, 
May, 1883 ; and at the Annual Meeting of the Cumberland 
Association at Ambleside.
) 
Mv only excuse for reading this paper was that anything that 
pertained to the English Lake District had an interest for members 
of a Wordsworth Society.
My excuse for reading it to-day 
must be, that, as a Literary and Scientific Society, we dwellers 
in Lakeland are peculiarly responsible for the preservation of 
hill and dale for the Literary and Scientific society of all 
England.
The battle that was lately fought and won against 
the steam-dragon of Honister — the Braithwaite and Buttermere 
Railway — is a thing of the past", but to Wordsworth is owed 
all thanks for the winning of it, and here, within a mile of the 
poet's haunts, his beloved Rydal— we may fitly thank him, in the 
strength of whose spirit the victory was gained.
There will, it is 
believed, in the near future, be more invasions and desecrations 
of Lakeland to be withstood.
The meeting to-day is fair augury 
that the same spirit will strengthen our hands to the necessary 
resistance.
We have found the double truth of that Sonnet Wordsworth 
wrote when he heard of the projected railway line to Windermere, 
We know now that 
There is no nook of English ground secure 
From rash assault, 
1(0 
and we also know that the "beautiful romance of Nature" — which 
any Lakeland hill or dale (and Borrowdale in particular) may be 
said to be — 
Given to the passing traveller's rapturous glance, 
can so well *' plead for its peace," that in less than three weeks 
from the day when it was heard that the projectors of a mineral 
and passenger line from Braithwaite to Buttermere had complied 
with standing orders, and that their Bill was awaiting a first reading 
in the House, the Standard, Spectator, Daily News, Times, Saturday 
Revietv, Pall Mall Gazette, Punch, The World, The Manchester 
Guardiati, The Leeds Mercury, The Yorkshire Post, and many 
other i^mportant provincial papers, were in arms, and, righteously 
and effectively indignant, did 
With torrents pure and strong, 
And constant voice protest against the wrong.
The line from the Sonnet, 
Given to the passing traveller s raptiirous glance, 
was quoted, because, from letters received upon the subject from 
many well-known names in English life and literature, one was 
so struck by the way in which such a valley as Borrowdale had left 
an indelible impression of its beauty upon the minds of those who 
but once had visited it.
One was prepared for this by reading a 
chance passage in Sir Archibald Alison's Life, when, after describing 
his walk up Borrowdale and over Honister Pass to Buttermere, 
he speaks of that single walk remaining with him, a vision of 
beauty, clear and bright after a period of forty years of toil and 
travel.
Forgive me if I quote a passage or two from the letters 
received to show what I mean.
The Dean of Westminster wrote : "I have only once seen 
Borrowdale, but that once was quite sufficient to make me willing 
to do anything in my power to help you to preserve it." 
I know I shall not have to apologise to him jf, side by side, I 
quote a letter received from a poor working woman in Birmingham, 
who, sending a shilling towards "The Borrowdale and Derwentwater 
71 
Defence Fund," said with pathos: "Will you kindly receive this 
mite from a Birmingham working woman, in grateful remembrance 
of a holiday in the district, whose never-to-be-forgotten beauties 
have been a joy to her through many hours of toil in dirt and 
smoke ?" 
In this last successful attempt to prevent the spohation of 
Borrowdale in the eyes of the 40,000 visitors who annually pass 
up it, and the vulgarising and disquieting of the valley to please 
the pockets and whims of nine non-resident quarry speculators, it 
is true that for us the railways fought in their courses.
Most 
fortunate was it for us that Sir Thomas Chambers and other City 
magnates wished to take their wives and families in third-class 
carriages from Chingford to High Beech, and to try their hand at 
improving the Epping Forest scenery by constructing railway 
embankments which should have all the appearance of being 
" natural undulations of the ground." Most opportune for us, too, 
was it, that the directors of the Underground Railway, 
Those [un]comfortable moles, whom, what they do, 
Teaches the limit of the just and true, 
had obtained blow-holes for their sulphurous breath which would 
permanently disfigure the Thames Embankment hard-by.
But, 
apart from the indignation roused against the too-powerful railway 
monopolies, and the mischief they were likely to do in the interest 
of the shareholder, there was evidence that Wordsworth's spirit of 
protest against railway invasion of one of the few retiring-grounds 
left to the old age of busy men — one of the few gathering-grounds 
for thought and commune with 
The Motion, and the Spirit that impels 
All thinking things, all objects of all thought.
And rolls through all things — 
one of the few recreation-grounds open to, and within easy distance 
for, the toilers of our northern towns, — there was evidence, I 
repeat, that that Wordsworthian spirit of protest was keenly alive, 
and was making itself heard and felt in our midst, so that at last, 
as the Spectator of April 14th put it, " Even the promoters of the 
line, who persisted till they reached the Lords, felt the indignation 
72 
of every educated man in England." Not the least interesting 
feature in the campaign was the strong sense of the need of 
resistance to our English Lake destruction that was felt across the 
Border.
My friend Professor Knight, the Secretary of the Words- 
worth Society, was a sheet-anchor of hope and encouragement to 
all of us who were organising resistance.
He urged that resistance 
on many potent grounds, but specially urged that the question of 
whether this or that Lakeland valley was or was not to be destroyed 
rested neither with the inhabitants nor inheritors of the dales — 
" for the dales in their beauty were the heritage of every English- 
man." And he also stated strongly that it was his conviction that 
since it was only the educated mind that would fully enter into 
The joy 
Of elevated thoughts, the sense sublime 
Of something far more deeply interfused.
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, 
And the round ocean, and the living air.
And the blue sky, 
it was not fair to say, This matter of whether a railway shall be 
made amongst the Lakes, is simply a question of whether the 
large masses of our manufacturing towns, need or care to be 
convenienced by the easy passage that a locomotive will give them 
to this or that particular place.
For though he would welcome 
them gladly to Nature's sanctuary, he felt that the outing, and not 
the scenery, was what the masses came for ; and, given the outing, 
the masses would be happy at whatever station they were set loose 
from the cheap-excursion railway carriages.
There is much truth 
in this.
As regards the first point, certain it is that the inhabitants 
of the dales, who have their world of beauty "too much with them 
late and soon," are not the safest guardians of their lovely homes.
One of the said dalesmen said to me, as we talked the matter 
over on the bridge at Grange : " Eh, but I'se not sure but what it 
uU add sommat new howiver to t' scenery.
It ull be a gay bit of 
life will a rail, mind ye, and folk ull set watches by t' trains ; it ull 
happen be a girt improavement to Borridale will t' railway." 
While, strange to say, the Lake District Association, which 
73 
has as one motive of its existence the advertising of the 
natural charms of Lakeland and its hotels; and, under most 
distinguished patronage, begs subscriptions to enable it to carry 
on the work, as indicated in its Rule 2, of rendering Lakeland 
attractive and popular as a place of resort atid residence, — with 
one or two exceptions, among which was its President, the 
Earl of Bective, this Society from first to last was obstinately in 
favour of the proposed Braithwaite and Buttermere line, and 
played into the hands of the promoters in a most curious manner.
Heaven save us from such custodians of the Lakes !
But to 
return to the interest felt and help that came from across the 
Border : — 
Principal Shairp wrote from St. Andrews : — 
" England has not so many holiday-grounds open to all her 
people that she can afford to let one of the most beautiful be 
wantonly destroyed and desecrated.
. .
In those solitary places, 
thousands, every year, of all sorts and conditions of our country- 
men, gather bodily refreshment and mental elevation.
This surely 
is a national privilege not lightly to be sacrificed." 
From Edinburgh we heard Professor Blackie's fierce and em- 
phatic sentences : — 
" I cannot imagine any more sacred duty of good citizens, at 
the present moment, than to save the natural beauties of the 
country from the defacing operations of men who have no sense 
for anything in the world but mercantile speculation and the lust 
of gain.
If God made the world beautiful, it was that its beauty 
might be enjoyed, and men have no right for local convenience 
and temporary utilities to make it systematically ugly." 
From Professor Campbell Eraser came the wise words : — 
" It is because I believe that the struggle to bar the entrance of 
the Stygian locomotive into Borrowdale is on behalf of interests in 
which the whole nation is concerned, that I cordially co-operate.
"The increasing pressure of life in this crowded and busy 
island is one of many reasons why the north-west corner of 
England should be saved as one of the few classic retreats still 
74 
open for rest and recreative communion with Nature to those who 
have to do the work attd thought of the world.
The national 
education, and our continued social stability, so bound up with 
the higher education, make such retreats more than ever necessary 
for us.
At least the vales of Cumberland and Westmoreland, charged 
with the spirit of Wordsworth, must be left undisturbed by sound of 
the railway, as Nature's own English University in the age of great 
cities." 
From Glasgow came help and enthusiastic encouragement.
With such a friend as the Poet of the Border, Professor Veitch, to 
back us, we need never fear for help in time of EngHsh Lakeland 
invasion or desecration.
All that work and word will do will be 
done by him.
We owe him great thanks.
Principal Caird was 
warmly with us, as also was Mr. Smart, the Secretary of the Ruskin 
Society in Glasgow.
Professor Edward Caird wrote : " Parliament might as well 
sanction the taking of the canvases from their frames in the 
National Gallery to be used for towels, as give powers to the 
Braithwaite and Buttermere Railway," a sentence which for pith 
reminds one of a sentence in Mr. Frederick Harrison's letter, 
" that he would rather see a railway through Hyde Park than 
through Borrowdale." Professor Nichol was, in his letters, as 
indignant as a great command of language and a powerful way of 
putting things enables a man to be.
Of the hundreds of letters 
received from men and women who knew Borrowdale well, there 
seemed to be in each some individualising difference in the reasons 
given for their individual protests.
One gentleman, who offered us ;^iooo if Government would buy 
up Honister and preserve it unquarried to futurity, wrote : " The 
English people have the good fortune to inherit a small group of 
mountains, geologically among the most ancient, artistically among 
the most beautiful, on the face of the earth.
Hitherto the Railway 
Companies, while they have been granted greater facilities for 
bringing people who have to spend the greater part of their lives 
in less favoured spots, to within easy reach ofonr fairest playground, 
have been prevented from marring its beauty, and, what is of more 
75 
importance, from disturbing its serenity.
In these days of high 
pressure and competition the value of places where the beauty of 
Nature may be enjoyed, apart from the disturbing influences of 
railway and factory, is such as cannot be estitnaied in gold.
If 
mining companies are to be allowed to fill up our lakes, and 
railway companies to destroy the grand sweep of our hillsides, 
where are our poets and artists to draw their inspiration in the 
future, and where are the masses to cultivate those higher feelings 
which make it alone possible to understand the artists and poets ?" 
I ask you to remember that last sentence, for Sir F.
Leighton, 
the President of the Royal Academy, in his letter spoke truly 
when he said : " A passionate love for the beauties of Nature is 
one of the finest and most wholesome features of English character.
The growing tendency to blot out or to foul the springs from 
which that love is fed, is, in my view, a grave and forecasting evil." 
He added, " By all means add my name to the names of those 
who protest with warmth and dismay against the prospect of 
running a railway through Borrowdale." 
The author of /ohn Inglesant brought into prominent view 
another feature of the evil of scarring the sides of our Lake hills 
with quarries and rails, and enlisted the sound commercial spirit 
on our side.
He showed that the opening of fresh quarries, at a 
time when slate was a glut in the market, was part and parcel of 
the short-sighted policy by which the projectors of such railways, 
and the necessary bubble companies to pay for them, were making 
mischief in the English world of trade.
He did not, you may be 
sure, forget the other reasons in the higher worlds for protest 
against this special injury to the land of thought, and the resting- 
place of weary hand and brain workers of to-day.
Of course, in this national defence, as it eventuated, of a 
national pleasure-ground, hard things were said of the defenders.
They were accused of an unrighteous wish to keep cheap-trippers 
at a distance ; of 
Grudging that crowded streets sent out 
In Sabbath glee the sons of care and doubt.
But such calumny was as old as the attack on Wordsworth when 
76 
he protested for the sake of Lakeland quiet.
When Wordsworth 
wrote his Sonnet against railways, it would seem, from a letter 
Hartley Coleridge penned to a Kendal paper, dated Ambleside, 
November 20th, 1844, that he was accused of wishing to keep 
the multitudes from visiting the Lakes.
"I do protest," says Hartley Coleridge, "against the calumny — 
calumny, I hope, of ignorance, not of malice — which ascribes to 
Wordsworth the unworthy wish to make the Lakes a cabinet 
curiosity, like a unique copy of a book to be shown as a special 
favour to such of his admirers as come in their own carriage.
" Mr. Wordsworth does not object to the railroad because it 
will bring a poorer class to see the Lakes than has hitherto been 
able to indulge in that luxury, but for the sake of the inevitable 
violation of domestic privacy, for the stones and trees and the 
humble homes it must destroy.
. .
I believe Mr. Wordsworth 
objects, not for himself, but for Nature and mankind." 
This last reason for protest against railway lines in Lakeland is 
as forcible to-day as it was in 1844.
It is true that the Lake District 
is fairly girdled with the iron rail, and easy access is possible from 
all sides.
It is equally true that each year brings larger crowds of 
tourists, who avail themselves of it, into the country.
Yet the 
Cumbrian and Westmorland peasant, for all the attempts to spoil 
him, for all the tourist prices and presents, is as yet a character 
unspoiled.
It does credit to his moral sinew that it is so ; he is 
sorely tempted and tampered with.
But these dalesmen are made 
of such rare peasant stuff that it is worth preserving.
Slow of 
song, brief of speech, but sure of word as they are, where else in 
any much-betouristed part of England will travellers find such 
freedom of foot to come and go over intakes, and through farms, 
as is allowed him by the men of Westmorland and Cumberland ?
If ever you do find yourself brought up sharp by word of mouth 
or by notice-board, it will be almost certainly by some one who 
has bought up the small statesmen, and laid farm to farm, and 
who brings his city manners with him.
Where else in England will you find whole valleys in which, 
77 
from end to end, to put key into house-door at night-time, or 
during absence from home, is an unheard-of thing 1 
It was but the other day that Mr. Maurice wrote that he had 
had a lasting impression of the honesty of our Lakeland folk made 
upon him, when, years ago, he first stepped from the train at 
Windermere, he asked where he should deposit his luggage while 
he proceeded up Orrest Head to bide the starting of the coach, 
and was told "he could just leave it anywhere, in- or out-side the 
station.
For," said the station-master, "it 'ill be safe; we are none 
of your Liverpool nor Lotidonfolk up here.'" 
But Wordsworth, as Coleridge tells us in his "apologetic letter," 
had the homes of these dalesmen in his mind when he protested 
against the railway's invasion of them.
And no one who has 
heard how, three years ago, the little village of Rosthwaite in 
Borrowdale was made pandemonium by the navvies engaged to 
construct a little slate tramway high up on the Honister Pass, can 
fail to see that a grave consideration is owed to the dwellers and 
inheritors of the dales when any scheme is projected that will 
bring so alien and unwelcome an element into their midst as a 
swarm of navvies.
" It uU be a bad day for Borridale if they come hereabout," 
said a Rosthwaite farmer to me when I was collecting evidence 
against the Braithwaite and Buttermere Railway, "It ull be bad 
for t' young lasses, an' bad for t' holiday folk, an' bad for t' chicks, 
an' we shell hev to clap on locks o' round " !
Now for the conclusion of the whole matter : If the Honister 
Pass steam-dragon has been baffled, other objectionable threats of 
invasion of Northern England's recreation- and thinking-grounds 
are being made.
Other projects are already astir.
Our only 
chance of keeping Lakeland inviolate is to be on the watch with a 
powerful national, one might dare to say international, committee 
— for the Americans are as indignant as we are at the attempt on 
Borrowdale — and the Scotch Lakes and hills are in equal jeopardy 
— with a backing of Members of Parliament to help us at West- 
minster, and a considerable sum of money behind us for expenses 
if need be.
This can, it is thought, best be done by forming a 
78 
Permanent Lake District Defence Society, which, in league 
with the Commons Preservation Society, and other associations 
with kindred aims, such as the Kyrle and Ruskin Societies are, 
shall have a Guarantee Fund of not less than ;^Sooo ready for 
use.
The Executive of the Borrowdale and Derwentwater Defence 
Committee have issued circulars, of which I append a copy, and 
the Guarantee Fund already is in process of formation.
Some time hence, who knows, a wise Government may enable 
the Lake District to have a special Act to protect it from railroad 
outrage for the people, as has been done in the Yellow-Stone Park, 
and partially in the Yosemite Valley of America (though there the 
State not only provided an Act, but first bought it up for the 
people's use).
Meanwhile it is suggested, that since the members of the Words- 
worth Society, to whom this paper was read in London, show their 
zeal in the cause by joining us; it would be a gracious act to the 
memory of the great poet if, as a body, you elected to co-operate 
with the Lake District Defence Society, even as the Wordsworth 
Society has elected to co-operate with us.
Lord Houghton (then Mr. Milnes), in answer to Wordsworth's 
Sonnet (in days, I suppose, when it looked as if steam was never 
to be turned of in a siding, or to blow off at a terminus, but was 
to dash its hot way through all things), said in sonnet fashion— 
The hour may come, — nay, must, in these our days, 
When the harsh steam-car, with the cataract's shout 
Shall mingle its swift roll, and motley rout 
Of multitudes these mountain echoes raise.
And thou, the Patriarch of these pleasant ways, 
Canst hardly grudge that crowded streets send out 
In Sabbath glee the sons of care and doubt 
To read these scenes by light of thine own lays.
We answer, that neither the Patriarch, nor we his humble and 
very grateful disciples, grudge the fair free use of Lakeland to all 
sons of toil and doubt who will come, Wordsworth in hand, " to 
see, and honour, and believe." The more the better for England's 
future of thought and high feeling.
79 
Lord Houghton continues : — 
Disordered laughter, and encounter rude, 
The poet's finer sense perchance may pain.
Yet many a glade and nook of solitude 
For quiet walk and thought will still remain 
Where he the poor intruders may elude, 
Nor lose one golden dream from all their homely gain.
It is a grotesque picture— Wordsworth dodging, to get away from 
the tourist swarms in Ambleside, up the Stock Ghyll ravine, then 
losing half of his "golden dream" by finding he has to elude more 
"poor intruders" at the top of the Force; or, turning home by 
some old familiar way, to find he must double back to get to Rydal 
without " encounter rude," and its accompaniment of " disordered 
laughter," all the poet's "golden dream" now lost, and himself in a 
bad temper into the bargain.
We maintain, as is maintained by 
Dr. Cradock— than whom no one living more thoroughly knows 
the poet's haunts— that once let "the harsh steam-car, with the 
cataract's shout" mingle its "swift roll" in any single valley, a 
precedent will be established "for even worse outrages," and no 
vale mil be safe.
We shall have, as Professor Ruskin prophesied 
the other day, "a railway for Cook's excursion trains up Scaw 
Fell, another up Helvellyn, and a third up Skiddaw, with a circular 
line to connect all three branches." 
No glade, no nook of sohtude 
For quiet walk and thought will then remain, 
and England will be immeasurably the poorer.
Professor E.
Dowden of Dublin, in a letter of protest against the steam-dragon 
of Honister, wrote:— "As one century generally discovers the 
sins of its predecessors, and is hard on them, I have some hopes 
that the twentieth century, so close at hand, may grow indignant 
with the nineteenth for its destruction of so much that forms part 
of the true wealth of life, and resolve to act more wisely." Let 
us, as a Literary and Scientific Society in Cumberland and 
Westmorland, determine, so far as pertains to Westmorland and 
Cumberland, to help the nineteenth century to a timely repent- 
ance.
England is beginning to become a nation that believes 
80 
in education.
There is hope that as the next generation will be 
much more busy to keep the pleasure-grounds of Lakeland 
undestroyed, so it will be more capable of appreciating their 
peace and beauty undisturbed.

p.S.
— Since reading the above at the London and Ambleside 
Meetings, a letter has reached me from America, which is worth 
quoting.
Mr. C.
J. Hubbard, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 
writes: — "If voices from this side of the Atlantic could prevent the 
Vandalism of the proposed railway along the shores of Derwentwater 
— as dear to the hearts of many Americans as it is to English tourists 
— I am sure the Company would be forced to abandon the project.
I have a vivid recollection of the beauties of your Lake Country, 
and I sincerely hope that nothing will be done to mar the lovely 
scenery.
The railroad magnates here (as with you) have no mercy 
upon our landscape, and everything is sacrificed to increased divi- 
dends.^' That last sentence is bad hearing, but even in America 
there is a determined stand now being made to keep the locomotive 
from some of the finest scenery.
Many attempts have been made 
to obtain sanction for lines through the Adirondac Valley without 
success ; and only the other day some Americans, speaking of the 
projected railway up Ennerdale, and the L.
JSI.- W.
R. branch from 
Yanwath, up the beautiful Eamont Vale to Pooley Bridge, at the 
foot of Ullswater, said that in America the projectors of such lines 
would have no chance of obtaining sanction for them from the 
Legislature.
Professor C.
E. Norton, of Cambridge, Mass., has 
written warmly, and will do all in his power to set on foot a 
a Committee in America to co-operate with us.
The educated 
Americans feel more keenly than we do, by a sadder experience, 
how scenery can be spoiled.
Their tracts of scenery, too, are so 
vast as to make combination against the spoilers almost impossible.
They are the more determined to keep English Lakeland from the 
81 
hand of the destroyer.
The Rev. Charles M.
Addison, St. John's 
Rectory, ArHngton, Mass., also writes warmly, and thinks we shall 
through Professor Palmer of Harvard, a member of our Committee, 
be enabled to enlist much international help in that University.
Whilst this was passing through the press, another attempt 
upon the seclusion of our English lakes and valleys has been 
frustrated, in the failure of the promoters of the Ennerdale Railway 
Bill to make out a case before a Select Committee of the House.
Members of the Lake District Defence Society were able to give 
useful support and evidence against the scheme before the Parlia- 
mentary Committee.

We, the undersigned Members of the Executive Committee, 
beg herewith to tender you our most sincere thanks for your 
co-operation and assistance in the successful opposition to the 
Braithwaite and Buttermere Railway Scheme.
Although the Bill has been withdrawn, we have good reason 
for believing that other projects of an aggressive nature are in 
contemplation.
It is therefore proposed to form a Permanent 
Society for the Defence of the Lake District, of which Society 
we earnestly hope you will become a Member.
We have determined to raise a Guarantee Fund of at least 
The existence of this fund will in itself check the promotion 
of objectionable railway schemes in the future.
We suggest that the amount of each guarantee should be not 
less than ;£x, and your liabihty will only extend to objects of

i 
THE LANGUAGE OF LAKELAND IN ITS TESTIMONY 
TO THE NORSEMAN AND THE CELT.
By Rev. T, ELLWOOD, B.A., Torver Rectory, Coniston, 
Ambleside.
(Read at the Ambleside Annual Meeting.) 
In the outset of my paper, I may venture to express two principles 
which have in some measure guided me in its composition.
\st.
— That the proper names of the district have a right to be 
claimed to have a place as the exponents of its language— »as being 
the remnants of the language of its earlier inhabitants ; and, 
2ndly, — That the Folk-Speech of these our mountain valleys differs 
from English, usually so called, in that it has preserved the most 
archaic forms of words, and in that we retain in the dialect of our 
dalesmen original forms of speech which the polish of refined 
society has elsewhere improved off the face of the earth.
The records of the Norsemen as we find them in our English 
Histories are Httle more than one continued series of piratical 
descents upon our coasts ; of plunderings, burnings, and devast- 
ation.
Commencing in the early part of the 9th Century, or even 
earlier, their attacks are continued to the time of the Conquest ; 
and their sea-kings, when they did for a time settle down upon 
the coast or go further inland, still seem to have maintained their 
old spirit of piracy and plunder — roaming about without any 
settled habitation — taking where and what they could.
A verse 
84 
from your own Rydal poet, Wordsworth, may serve to show their 
character: — 
For why ?
because the good old rule 
Sufficeth them, the simple plan, 
That they should take who have the power, 
And they should keep who can.
And yet, when we examine the records given by language, their 
words and ways must have had a great effect in the North and in 
Lakeland at least, upon the formation of home language, and upon 
that with which home language is most intimately connected — the 
manners and customs of social life.
I have thought it well in dealing with this subject, to commence 
with the proper names of the streams and mountains, and such 
other natural features of Lakeland as may seem to bear any testi- 
mony to the language of the Norsemen — for whenever a race of 
men have inhabited a country, though they may for centuries have 
passed away and been forgotten, yet the chances are very great 
that they have left some trace of their language in what may at 
length have become the proper names of the country.
And just 
as our hills and valleys are made up of various strata, and contain 
beneath them fossils, which, when rightly read, indicate their 
inhabitants in the long bygone ages — ^just so do the names of the 
same hills and valleys contain a stratification of the language of 
the various races who one after another had their homes amongst 
them ; and when they as distinctive races, were gradually merged 
in or supplanted by other races, left their most lasting records, 
not in the tumuli or cairns which they reared over their ashes, but 
in the names which they assigned to the everlasting hills.
The language of the Norsemen has often occurred to me in the 
names of the hills and streams when I have been crossing Redbank 
from Grasmere, or wandering about at Langdale Head.
In the 
Norse staker, a tall, columnar rock, we have there The Stake, and 
The Pike of Stickle.
In Kringle Crags, which seem to form the 
segments of a circle, we have the Norse kringla, a circle.
Gills 
and becks are both Norse; and I need not tell you in what 
abundance those names cluster about the head of Langdale, 
85 
together wuh the dales of Tilberthwaite, Yewdale, and other 
va eys wh.ch diverge from .t ; only, I n.ay remark that, as the term 
Gill has exactly the same meaning in Norway as ia Lakeland- 
and I know of no more perfect example of what is meant by the 
term than we find in the case of Tilberthwaite Gill, where the 
waters collected upon the uplands of Weatherlam, are poured firs 
of all down a precipice, and then force themselves through a steep 
nai^ow and rocky gorge, in places affording the most scanty foot 
hold for the traveller to thread his way beside the foaming sLam 
A m the Norse, means water, and we seem to retain it in 
Brathay, Rothay, Greta, Liza, and Eamont 
You have Fairfield, near Ambleside, and we have the same 
name to describe a level portion of the Coniston Old Man. which 
IS spoken of as the Fairfield.
It is elsewhere used to designate 
a tableland upon the mountains in the Lake Country, so that it 
seems to be almost as much of a common as a proper nal 
^ar.
the Norse for sheep, as in the Faroe, i.e., hterally'the "p 
.sands; and Fairfield appears to have been originally'the Sheep 
n r'u ?
"P '""^ P"''"''"' ""^°"§ ^he Yorkshire hills are 
called the far pastures, or sheep pastures.
There is a number of Norse words in the Lake Country which 
seem to partake partly of the character of proper names, and partly 
01 that of common names.
There is the word Gar^s, for example, which in the Norse is 
used as signifying a field or enclosure, and has also that meaning 
m the Bible of Ulphilas.* And in entering the vale of Yewdalf 
from Coniston, a well-wooded eminence across the stream to the 
right forms one of the loveliest features in that lovely landscape, 
and that enclosure is called the Cards.
The Gards is also applied 
in the same way to several places in Cumberland, including a farm 
of the name near Ireby ; and that large field which is encircled by 
the village in the Abbey Town.
And in all those instances they 
are spoken of as the Gards, indicating that the name had been 
John X.
I., Gards lambe is put for sheen fnlH v^^ ^\ ^ .
86 
well known and understood in its general application, just as at 
present we speak of the meadows, the commons, or the fells.
Another form of this word, with the same meaning of enclosure, 
is found in Garth, as Hall Garth, Garth Nook, Apple Garth, Dale 
Garth.
The word Garth, however, has a closer and more general 
connexion with our dialect, and I well remember that in the 
language of our elders the word Garden was almost unknown — it 
was Garth.
And in some parts of Cumberland the Stackyard is 
the Stackgarth, and the Churchyard is the Kurkgarth in the present 
day.
The word Thwaite, a clearing in a forest, also meaning field or 
enclosure, is a Norse name, which, partly as a suffix and partly as 
a common noun, is found in very general use in Lakeland.
There 
are a number of fields called the Thwaites on the margin of 
Coniston lake, at the upper end of it, between the Water Head 
and Coniston Hall.
Here we have it as a common noun.
There 
is a residence called The Thwaite, not far from them.
A family 
called Thwaite has for generations been resident in Coniston.
Taking the name, however, as a suffix, we have it everywhere in 
the Lake Country — Tilberthwaite, Applethwaite, Legberthwaite, 
Rosethwaite, Stonethwaite, Leathwaite, Finsthwaite.
In the dis- 
trict it might, in proper names, -upon a very moderate calculation 
be pointed out forty or fifty times.
Again, there is the word Hatise, which we have very often 
applied to the mountain passes of Lakeland; and, according to 
Cleasby, the word Hause (German Hals, the neck,) is in the very 
same sense applied to the mountain passes which connect the 
valleys of Iceland.
Hence also in Lakeland we have Seatoller 
Hause, Tvn Hause, Gaits Hause, Hause Water, and The Hause 
— all descriptive of or closely connected with some mountain 
pass.
Tarn, too, is Danish, and seems to come from the same root as 
our word tear — to describe the tears or tricklings from the rocks.
Holme is Norse, and we have it also used both as a suffix and 
as a common noun.
There are several holms upon Windermere, 
and many scattered about in various parts of this district ; while 
87 
that great tract of level and fertile land which, commencing near 
the confluence of the Wampool and the Waver, extends for many 
miles along the coast of the Solway, called the Holme or the 
Abbey Holme — marks, I think, the point where many of the 
Norsemen must have landed and settled upon the shores of the 
Solway ; for I know of no other district which in an equal area 
includes so many names that are purely and distinctively Norse.
Ness, Beck* and Force (Fos) are all Norse, and are of such frequent 
occurrence that it is needless to point out the names and places in 
which they are found.
Speaking of the Solway, I am reminded of a term which the 
Norse'settlers must have first introduced.
Haaf is the old Norse 
word for the sea ; and the fishermen of the Solway speak of their 
sea nets as?the haaf-nets, and describe sea fishing as haafing; and 
in their old charters the word is spelled haaf — exactly as it is 
spelled in the Norse.
Havex\^g, Millom, the most south-western 
point of Cumberland — washed on one side by the Duddon, on 
the other by the sea — is evidently Ifaaf-ridge, or sea-ridge.
There are really three divisions of language which may be said 
to represent the Old Norse, or Scandinavian, viz.
— Icelandic, 
Danish, and Norwegian.
I have, however, the authority of one of 
our most eminent scholars — a Cumbrian by extraction — and very 
intimately acquainted with the Norse, both by residence in 
Denmark and by the fact that he had a share in bringing out a 
standard work in Icelandic, " Cleasby's Icelandic Dictionary" — 
I have his authority for saying that with the exception of nautical 
terms and other words of that class, these three divisions are in a 
great measure identical, and any one of them may be used for root 
words in contrasting our own dialect with the Norse.
So far I have confined myself to proper names or to words 
which may be regarded as on the borderland between proper 
names and common names ; but now I should like to draw your 
attention to the Language of Lakeland properly so called.
To 
* The proper name Beckermet is evidently from the Norse Bekkja, gen.
plu.
of Bekkr—\itQk, and oto/= meeting, i.e., the meeting of the waters.
The 
village of Beckermet stands at the confluence of two streams.
88 
speak of the similarity of the two generally, the gentleman to whom 
I have already referred wrote to me when he was staying at Elsinore 
in Denmark, saying that the dialect used there was so Uke to the 
dialect used in the Lake country, that a countryman from here 
and a countryman from that neighbourhood would, if speaking 
their respective dialects, be almost able mutually to understand 
one another.
I put this in some measure to the test, for I pro- 
cured a Danish Bible, and I found — thanks in a great measure to 
my acquaintance with the Cumbrian dialect — that there were 
whole verses and even whole chapters that I could read without 
much help from the dictionary.
I have mentioned Cleasby's Icelandic Dictionary, which, 
according to what I can gather from those who know the subject 
well, is most exhaustive, not in Icelandic alone, but also in its 
quotations from the classic literature of Scandinavia, and its 
comparison of Icelandic with the cognate languages.
It is the pro- 
duction of a Westmorland gentleman from Stainmore, who spent a 
great part of his life and fortune in elucidating the subject he had 
taken in hand, and who I think may reasonably be presumed to 
have owed some of the great ardour which animated him, as well 
as his great success in the work, to the fact that the dialect he 
had at first known was in some measure cognate with the language 
he thus took up.
The Norse words we have most unmistakeably in our dialect 
are what may be called home words.
For example, in the old 
fashioned houses which many of you may remember to have seen, 
there was a beam which extended across the house and across the 
old fashioned open chimney ; it served for suspending the long 
crook from, and was also used for hanging bacon or meat from in 
the open space above the fire ; this was always known as the 
rannal boak.
Now rann in the Icelandic means house, balk is a 
beam, hence in the rannal boak we have the house beam.
The 
word ransack is from the same root, and means in Icelandic to 
search a house, reminding us of the house-searching or plundering 
propensities of the Norsemen.
Few who know anythmg about the hearth fires formerly used in 
89 
the Lake country are unacquainted with the brandrifh.
It was an 
iron tripod held together by rims of iron, and employed in sup- 
porting the gird/e-^/aU used above the hearth fire in baking oat-bread, 
and was at one time in very general use.
The name brandrith is 
entirely and without change a Scandinavian name (see Cleasby, 
brand reid), and, although the name and the thing named are 
gradually passing away before modern improvements, yet there is 
hardly a valley in Lakeland in which they may not yet be found, 
and are not yet occasionally used.
In Lakeland our most general name for fuel is fire-eldin ; the 
Old Norse for fuel is elding^ which again comes from the Norse 
eldr, fire.
Lowe is a flame, and corresponds with the Danish hie ; 
both point to a connexion with the Meso-Gothic liuham, to 
enlighten.
In the Danish Bible we have eldr — fire, and hie — a 
flame, compounded together in one word in Exodus iii., where the 
flame of fire is called ildslue.
For tongs we have tangs in one part 
of the Lake district, and tengs in another; there is evidently a 
relationship in the Norse, for tangs is the Swedish, tang, Danish; 
tang meaning tied together.
The Danish word toft, signifying an enclosure, or what is en- 
closed by farm buildings, including the farm-house, is found as a 
proper name in some parts of England, as Lowestoft.
In Cumber- 
land, however, and portions of Lakeland, it is still retained as a 
common noun.
I was born and brought up in what was then an 
isolated district in Cumberland, and until I was eleven or twelve 
years of age, I hardly knew any other name for farm buildings than 
toft.
Almost the first question that a Cumberland farmer asks 
about a farm is, what sort of a toft there is upon it ; and he 
generally speaks about getting his toft done up, when he is about 
to have his buildings put in repair.
The Rev. I.
Taylor, in his 
well known Text-Book of Names and Places, says that this Danish 
word toft is found elsewhere in the proper names of England, but 
that in Lakeland it is almost, if not altogether, unknown ; and 
hence he concludes that the race that inhabited those regions of 
Lakeland were the Norwegians, and not the Danes ; and he 
assumes this apparently because in looking over the map he does 
90 
not find toft compounded in proper names.
I would suggest that 
it is just because it is in such common use that we do not find it 
in proper names.
There is an implement used by farmers in Cumberland and the 
Lake Country called z.fotring iron, for severing the awns from the 
barley.
The bottom part is in the form of a square, and is made 
of parallel plates of sheet iron.
It is used between the feet, hence 
the process is called /^/Ww^, and they who use it are said to fotr 
— evidently a most direct derivation from the Icelandic Norse 
fotr — afoot; plural, /^^/r.
It may be objected that the sound of this word, and of some 
other words I have quoted, was likely to be more changed by the 
wear^and tear of oral transmission from the times of the Norsemen.
As a proof, however, that old Northern words have in some cases 
retained their sound and significance in English, I may instance 
the following examples from the Moeso-Gothic Bible of Ulphilas, 
translated in the 4th Century : — 
Ik im thata daur — for I am that door.
Naiih leitla hweila — for now a little while.
Hardu ist thata waurd — for hard is that word.
A stag (from Old Norse stiga, to mount) is in the Lake District 
a colt which is being first mounted or broken in.
Lathe, is a barn, from Old Norse hlatha, Danish lade, a barn.
The dairy furnishes us with kurn, from Norse kirfta, a churn ; 
and site, from Norse sahl, a sieve.
Reckling, the feeblest member of a litter of pigs or a brood of 
chickens, is evidently from Norse recklingr, an outcast.
Cowp, to exchange, is well known in this district, and Anderson 
and other Cumberland poets speak of horse-cowpers.
Kaupa in 
Old Norse is to barter, or exchange.
Copen are merchants in 
Danish, and we have Copenhagen, or the merchants' haven.
All who know anything about the stone fences of the Lake 
country know what the cam or top ridge is.
In O.N. kambr is a 
ridge or fence on the moots formed by digging two ditches and 
throwing up a ridge or fence between them.* We have also Catcam, 
* A dyke so formed is yet called a Cam (ICEm) in North- West Yorkshire.
[£d.] 
i 
91 
on Helvellyn, a cam so steep that it would, I presume, serve to 
turn a cat.
Reek, well known in the dialect as meaning smoke, is Norse.
We have Beikjavick, or smoke town, the capital of Iceland, 
reminding us of "Auld Reekie," or Edinburgh, of Burns.
Silgi, or s/ee, in Norse is a steep ascent, hence we have in 
Cumberland sfee, a ladder, and also the steep ascent of the Sty 
Head Pass.
Addle, in our dialect, means to earn, as in the familiar example 
of addling brass, and evidently comes from Norse odal, property.
Bain, near, is from Icelandic beifm, straight ; f bainest way, in 
Cumberland, exactly represents beintsr vegr in Icelandic.
Cap in Cumberland means to beat, connected apparently with 
N. kapp, a contest ; and Anderson, when describing (the natural 
beauties of Cumberland, uses this word very effectively when he 
says : — 
Yer buik-lam'd wise gentry, that's seen monie countries, 
May preach and palavar and brag as they will 
O' mountains, lakes, valleys, woods, waiters, and meadows, 
Bit canny aul' Cummerlan' caps them aw still.
Lee, a scythe, is the same word with the same meaning in 
Danish.
Seyme, the straw rope which is used by farmers in making secure 
the coverings of their stacks, is the Icelandic seimr, a string or 
rope.
Reinns, amongst the Cumberland farmers, are strips of land 
which have been left unploughed, and used sometimes to sever 
fields, and comes evidently from Icelandic rein, a strip of land.
In Icelandic ragna rein is the heavenly strip, or rainbow.
Humtner, in Lakeland, is the same word as hiiammr in Iceland, 
and both are applied to a grassy slope or vale.
Many more instances might be given ; but this paper has been 
undertaken rather to commence than to exhaust the subject, and 
to try to show that the dialect, as well as the proper names of the 
district, bear abundant testimony to the history and to the ancestors 
of our race.
It is not difficult to show that the Celtic must have had an 
influence in forming the proper names of this district.
Cumberland 
seems to be Cymriland, Cytnri being the name that the Welsh 
apply to themselves ; and the section of the Celts who inhabited 
the kingdom of Strathclyde, which included Cumberland and 
Westmorland, undoubtedly belonged to the Welsh or Cmyric 
stock.
We have Welsh cwm, the deep crater in a hill, or the opening 
between two hills, in the name Black Comb, a portion of which 
also bears the Welsh name Pen, a head or hill.
Pen, a hill, is also 
applied to an immense mass of rock in Seathwaite.
In Tor-pen- 
how-hill we have four syllables, each of which in its own derivation 
means hill.
AVe have Pen in Penrith, red hill, and Penruddock.
Welsh Lyn is I think included in Helvellyn.
Cader, a seat in 
Blencathra, as Cader Idris in Wales, is Arthur's Seat.
It seems 
that Saddleback, the more modern name of the mountain, has 
retained the same idea of a seat.
Den is Celtic in Mickleden, at the head of Great Langdale ; and 
Langdale itself is at times called 'LdiWgden by the old inhabitants.
Skiddaw, the most striking objects of which from some points of 
view are its two peaks, contains the Celtic dau, Latin duo, two.
There is a mound or cairn of stones upon Skiddaw called Skiddaw 
Man. We have the same in the man or cairn what give its name 
to the Old Man of Coniston — alt maen, steep or high cairn.
Strath, in Langstrath in Borrowdale, is Celtic; so is Z>hu, in 
Dhucrags, near Coniston.
Dhu, is black, and certainly, so far as 
I know, there is not a blacker mass of rock in the whole compass 
of Lakeland.
Moel is Celtic for round conical hills or cairns ; we have it in 
Mealsgate, Eskmeals, and Millom, or Meol holm, which is bounded 
by one continuous fringe of sandhills on the side next the sea 
shore.
Dunmail is said to have been a mighty warrior who lost his life 
in a great battle on Dunmail Raise — the pass that bears his name 
at the head of Grasmere.
I have no wish to disturb his repose.
Requiescat in pace.
" Nothing he'll reck if they let him sleep on." 
93 
But yet it has often occurred to me when I have crossed that pass, 
in my wanderings to and from Cumberland, how likely it was that 
in this same Dunmail Raise, that Dun was a hill fort, which is its 
meaning in Celtic, and that mail were the meols or mounds or 
cairns which are scattered about at the head of the pass.
Raise is 
Norse for stone heap or mound, and is very commonly found in 
the Lake district.
Thus far I have, I think, adduced evidence to show that a 
Celtic element exists in the proper names of Lakeland.
I cannot, 
however, follow it up as I tried to do in the Norse by showing 
that we still have many unmistakeable Celtic words as a part of 
our spoken dialect — for certainly what few Celtic words we have 
are not peculiar to the dialect of the Lake country, and are there- 
fore no evidence that a Celtic dialect and occupation continued 
here after it had disappeared from the districts around.
And yet a singular testimony to the Celt has in this neighbour- 
hood been opened out, and partially investigated during the past 
fifteen or sixteen years.
I allude to what have been termed the 
Celtic or Cymric Numerals.
It really is in somewhat varied forms 
but the same in all its essential and distinctive features the Celtic 
or Cymric score, which is ascertained to have been formerly well 
known and extensively used in all parts of Lakeland for sheep- 
scoring and other purposes.
Mr. Ellis,* who was then President 
of the Philological Society, took up the matter ; and it is chiefly 
owing to his careful and exhautive treatment of it, that such 
important results have been obtained.
I very readily admit, 
therefore, that he was the pioneer in the subject, but the investi- 
gation of the Numerals, so far as Lakeland is concerned, has 
been in a great measure left in my hands.
I need not read you 
lists of those numerals, as you will find in the extract I have given 
from the Transactions of the Philological Society of England, four 
lists which I obtained from the Lake District.
" Mr. Ellis sums up his remarks about them as follows : — "The Score is a 
real system of counting, which was possibly widely known two or three hundred 
years ago, but which was rare even fifty years ago, though it is not yet quite 
forgotten." 
94 
Though foundln isolated instances in many parts of England, 
the most complete and extensive known sets of them have been 
obtained from Lakeland.
There is an absolute certainty that one 
set given herein (No. 5), and obtained by Mr. Browne of Tallentire 
Hall from Borrowdale, was in use very long before A.D. 1818, for Mr.
Browne says: — "It is just sixty years (i.e. now sixty-six years) 
since this list of numerals was obtained from the shepherds of 
Borrowdale as being then used by them.
Considering the retired 
character of the vale at that time, and the slowness of the people 
to take up anything new, and their small intercourse with others 
from whom they could learn them, I think it is an absolute 
certainty that they must have been in use very long before 
A.D. 1818." 
Another Cumberland and Westmorland set (No. 6) could.be 
.traced back for one hundred and thirty years, while the set 
(No. 3) I obtained at Coniston had been known and used there 
from time immemorial, and is firmly believed by those who are 
best acquainted with the dialect of the inhabitants, to have been 
part of the language of the first inhabitants of the place.
They 
are doubtless the Welsh or Cymric numerals.
My own impression 
is that they are too well known, and have been too deeply rooted 
in the language of the Lake country, to be the result of mere 
isolated importations.
Have they then come down from the 
Welsh or Celtic kingdom of Strathclyde, which at one time 
occupied these regions, and the language of which must have 
gradually receded before the more vigourous growth of the Anglo 
Saxon, just as the Welsh language is at present in Wales itself 
gradually receding before it ; but which nevertheless in those parts 
of Cumbria maintained its ground as a language to the time of 
Bede — to the time of the Norman Conquest ; according to Skene, 
in his recent work on Celtic Scotland, to the time of Stephen, and 
even according to some of our best local authorities, until after the 
time of the Reformation, and which, as the Celtic of Cornwall, 
has died out almost within living memory — also doubtless came to a 
gradual and almost imperceptible end.
Do we then in those 
Celtic numerals possess a solitary relic of our Celtic forerunners ?
95 
and could we, if we were able properly to trace them backward, 
find them merged in a Celtic dialect which again traced backward, 
would still widen out until it was conterminous with the length 
and breadth of the land, and had come down from a time when 
the Norse, the Anglo Saxon, and the Latin, with the various races 
they represented, were in Britain equally unrepresented and 
unknown ?
Bearing in mind how that in remote places like Torver and 
Borrowdale they have been handed down from generation to 
generation, I am almost assured that they can be no mere import- 
ation ; and I do not well see what else they can be, except a relic 
of some dialect that has left no note or record of when it passed 
away.
I am confirmed in this view by a work which appeared last year, 
written by Mr. Lucas, F.G.S., who was employed in the Geological 
Survey of Yorkshire, and to whom, in connexion with this subject, 
I was introduced by a gentleman who was at one time his fellow- 
labourer, the Rev. J.
Clifton Ward, formerly vicar of Rydal.
Mr. Lucas has embodied a portion of the results of his labours 
in an exhaustive work upon Nidderdale, where he found numerals 
almost exactly like those we have in Lakeland, and used by the 
farmers there very much in the same way as they were used here.
In that work he has reprinted for the purposes of comparison, 
almost the whole of two papers which I read upon the subject 
before the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society ; 
and he says that he has no doubt whatever that these Nidderdale 
numerals are the remnant of a Celtic dialect, for those that spoke 
such a dialect in that county are hardly yet cold in their graves.
If such a dialect existed there, it forms, I think, a strong argu- 
ment that such a dialect existed here also, for there is a very 
remarkable coincidence between the proper names and the dialect 
of that portion of the Pennine chain of mountains, and the proper 
names and dialect which we find here in Lakeland amongst the 
Cumbrian group.
The resemblance of the names of numbers is amongst the 
most cogent proofs of the affinity of language, and the fust Table 
96 
I have here given will show the great similarity between the 
Sanscrit and the Celtic group of numerals ; and the second will 
show the remarkable agreement between the Celtic and the 
numerals of Lakeland.
These numerals undoubtedly belong to the Welsh or Cymric 
division of the Celtic, as distinguished from the Gaelic, the Cornish, 
and the Breton j and it will be observed that the pemdec, i.e.
pimp dec, or 5 + 10 of the Old Welsh, is very like the bum fit of 
our own valleys.
The Welsh differs from the other Celtic systems 
by using un-ar-dec, etc., for 11, etc., and un-ar-pemdec, etc., for 
16, etc.
This connecting particle ar, according to Pugh's Welsh 
Grammar, means in excess of; so un-ar-dec (ii) really means one 
in excess of ten, and un-ar-pemdec, means one in excess of 5 + 10 : 
this will afford us a key for the very easy interpretation of the 
numerals of Lakeland, in which a is the equivalent of the Welsh 
ar, in excess of ; and therefore yan-a-dick means one in excess of 
ten ; and as bumfit very nearly corresponds \^\\.h pemdec, yan-a-bumjit 
is equivalent to one in excess of 5 + 10, and so on with the rest.
I have endeavoured in those tables and in those remarks to 
place before you a summary of what I have been able to gather 
on this subject ; I must refer you to the Transactions of the Philo- 
logical Society* for more numerous versions and for more detailed 
information.
And in conclusion, •!
am glad to have this opportunity to place 
on record my own deliberate opinion, strengthened by many 
and frequent enquiries upon the subject, that these numerals are 
no mere accidental importation, but a genuine relic of the language 
of the Celtic kingdom of Strathclyde.

Obtained by me from W.
Browne, Esq., of Tallentire Hall.
Mr. Browne 
says of them : — "It is just sixty years (now sixty-six years) since I obtained 
these numerals from my cousins, the Ponsonbys, at the time that Captain 
Ponsonby was residing at Barrow Hall, close to the entrance of Borrowdale.
There is absolute certainty that they must have been in use there long before 
A.D. 1818."

CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND DALES.
Obtained by me from W.
Bro\\'ne, Esq., of Tallentire Hall, who says : — 
"These numerals were obtained as the result of a number of letters of inquiry 
in the Cumberland and Westmorland dales.
They are from a female traditioner, 
who got them as a girl thirty years since, from a woman fifty years old, who 
got them from an old woman eighty years of age, when the woman of fifty was 
about fifteen.
The aged lady had known of them time out of mind.
Tiiat 
makes 30 + 35 + say 65 = 130 years."

CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS A LIST OF 
CUMBERLAND MOSSES.
By The Rev. R.
WOOD, Vicar of Rosley.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
The number of species included in the second edition of the 
London Catalogue of British Mosses is 568, of which two are very 
doubtful.
287 of these are recorded as having been found in 
Province 12, which includes Lake Lancashire, Cumberland, 
Westmoreland, and the Isle of Man.
The following list of Cumberland Mosses contains 183 species, 
and some varieties, nearly all of which have been found between 
High Pike and Oulton Moss, and by far the larger portion of them 
in the parishes of Westward and Caldbeck.
There is every 
probability therefore that a very much larger number may be 
found in Cumberland, especially in the mountainous districts.
Specimens of the Mosses in this list may be seen in the collection 
in the Carlisle Museum ; and I have no doubt that well-authenticated 
additions to this hst will be thankfully received by the authorities 
of the Museum.
The time of fruiting and the habitats have been 
taken principally from Wilson's " Bryologia Britannica."

THE GERMAN MINERS AT KESWICK.
By J.
FISHER CROSTHWAITE, F.S.A.
(Read before the Cumberland and Westmorland Archceological Society ; and also 
at Keswick, March 26th, 1883.
Reprinted by permission of the Council 
of the Cutnberland Association.) 
The first mention which I can find of the colony of German 
miners who settled in this parish in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 
is contained in an abstract of State Papers (Domestic Series) of 
the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, from 1547 — 1580, 
preserved in the State Paper department of Her Majesty's Public 
Record Office, by Mr. Robert Lemon, F.S.A.
The date is July i6th, 1561.
It is a letter from Dr. Nich.
Wotton and Peter Osborne to the Secretary of Stale, Sir William 
Cecill.
They say they have conferred with Steynbergh and the 
Master of the Savoy upon articles for the incorporation of a 
company for working the mines in England.
They enclose an 
indenture between the Queen, and John Steynbergh and Thomas 
Thurland (Master of the Savoy), for erecting a corporation for 
working mmes in England.
Three years later (September loth, 1564,) there is a memorial 
of Thomas Thurland, Master of the Savoy, and Sebastian Spydell 
and their company, desiring their grants for working mines and 
minerals in England and Wales may be transferred and assigned 
to Daniel Hechstetter.
On the loth of December, the same year, 
there is an extract of an indenture made by the Queen on the one 
112 
part, and Thomas Thurland and Daniel Hechstetter on the other, 
for the discovery and working of minerals.* 
On the 2oth of March, 1565, Ttiomas Thurland is at Keswick, 
and he writes to Secretary Cecill that he has received letters with 
report and assay of the copper ore.
He says the report made by 
those who assayed it, is incorrect.
The following month (April) there is a grant of discharge to 
Thomas Thurland, Master of the Savoy, Daniel Hechstetter and 
others, from all fifteenths, and other impositions, during the first 
beginning of their operations.
The following month (May 26th), Thurland and Hechstetter 
wrote to the Secretary of State, Cecill, that they have found ore 
containing silver in certain places in Cumberland.
They request 
to have warrant from the Queen to bring three hundred or four 
hundred foreign workmen to work it.
In July the Queen grants to Thurland and Hechstetter, to fell 
and appropriate, within Her Majesty's woods, timber sufficient to 
construct the buildings necessary for smelting all ores of gold, 
silver, copper, quicksilver, etc., within certain counties.
This indicates that the Radcliffe's were unfavourable to the 
miners, because the woods on their property were close at hand, 
and at that time would be suitable timber for the purpose.
* Thomas Thurland and Daniel Hechstetter, two Germans experienced in 
the art of mining, were invited to England by the Queen and Council, and 
being naturalized, obtained a licence under the Queen's letters patent for them- 
selves and for their heirs for ever to search for mines of gold, silver, and 
quicksilver in the royalties of several counties in England and Wales.
The 
profits they were to appropriate to their own use, excepting the tenth of all 
gold, silver, and quicksilver ore, which was reserved to the Crown, as was the 
pre-emption of refined gold and silver at a lower rate than the current price of 
these metals.
These several patentees, in order to create an adequate capital for prosecuting 
their extensive undertakings, divided a certain portion of their rights into shares, 
which they sold to opulent and enterprising individuals.
These were afterwards 
(about the year 1568), conjointly with these new proprietors, incorporated under 
the designation of "The Governors, Assistants, and Commonality of the Mines 
Royal." William, Earl of Pembroke, was appointed the first Governor, and 
the first Court of Assistants comprised several of the nobility, some leading 
citizens, and most of the foreigners to whom the grants had been originally 
made.

Then we find (July 27) that a commission was given for Thomas 
Thurland and Daniel Hechstetter to apprehend disorderly persons 
employed by them in the mines.
Mr. Daniel Hechstetter, touching his suit and petition for 
privilege of water-works for draining mines, etc., offers to form a 
company, and to give certain shares to the Earls of Pembroke and 
Leicester, Sir William Cecill, Mr. Tamworth, and Alderman 
Duckett.
Thomas Thurland writes (August 29) to Sir Edward Rogers, 
Comptroller of the Household ; Sir Fr : Knolleys, Vice-Chamber- 
lain; and Sir William Cecill, to say that he has proposed a 
composition with his creditors and the executors of one Warde.
April 23, 1566.
Daniel Hechstetter and Hans Louver write to 
Alderman Duckett from Augsburg, respecting the progress of the 
works for smelting copper and silver.
They say it is joyful news to 
hear that Mr. Secretary has shown himself so favourable ; they had 
hoped that the Earl of Leicester would have been the same.
They 
complain of Mr. Humphrey, and are sorry that the Marquis of 
Baden has quitted England in debt, and finish the letter with 
German news.
May 25.
Thomas Thurland writes from Keswick that he 
understands that there are certain ores of gold and silver to be 
found in the mines there, a secret which the strangers keep to 
themselves.
He wishes for a skilful man out of Flanders.
He 
tells Sir William Cecill that if he will not answer his letters, he 
will write no more, though he be the Queen's Chief Secretary for 
England.
June 8.
This brings remembrances to Mr. Thurland, Master 
of the Savoy, touching the mining operations at Keswick.
June 25.
Meantime, Hechstetter and Louver are at Augsburg, 
and write to Cecill.
They report the progress of the works at 
Keswick, and speak of the necessity of discharging some of the 
workmen there.
They say that the ores tested in Germany have 
produced good copper.
They are coming to England, and enclose 
an account of charges of mining operations at Keswick.
8 
114 
August I.
Thurland writes to Cecill that a copper mine has 
been discovered at Newlands, the best in England.
September 20.
Thurland's next letter is dated Rose Castle, 
and is to Sir William Cecill.
He says the smelting house and 
other mineral operations are in progress, but are more chargeable 
than he imagined.
He adds, " there is plenty of copper ore in the 
country." 
There is a bond of Sir Thomas Gresham, in the sum of five 
hundred crowns, to John Fuggar, as security for payment to John 
Steinberg,* for sending twenty German miners into England.
This document is endorsed by Cecill, " Parson Thurland." 
October 7.
Thomas Thurland, Provost of the Mines, writes 
from Keswick to Cecill.
He reports great progress of the mining 
works.
Says that the smelting houses and furnaces are erected, 
and that gold has been found in Crawford Muir.
October 10.
It would appear that considerable opposition was 
shown to the foreign miners by the English workmen.
In a letter 
from Daniel Hechstetter to Louver, he says he shall discharge 
some of the workmen.
That the Germans are ill-treated by the 
English workmen ; and he reports the murder of Leonard Stoultz 
by one Fisher and his accomplices, who were protected by Lady 
Ratchffe.
October 13.
Lionel Duckett writes to Cecill that he is about 
to despatch a messenger to Keswick.
He says the inhabitants of 
Keswick ought to be friendly to the foreigners there.
October 16.
Now the Queen exercises her authority by writing 
to Lord Scrope and the Justices of the Peace in Cumberland and 
Westmorland, to repress the assaults, murders, and outrages on the 
Almain miners lately come there for the purpose of working and 
searching minerals.
February 13, 1567.
Daniel Hechstetter writes to Cecill that 
Thomas Thurland is going to London, who will acquaint him with 
all things necessary for furthering their mineral operations.
March 14.
The Earl of Northumberland writes to the Earls 
• lu the Crosthwaite Registers, there is the burial of Mr. Mark Mark Stone- 
barger, December 4th, 1597.
115 
of Pembroke and Leicester and Sir William Cecill, that he has 
ascertained beyond doubt, that the minerals dug up at New- 
lands belong to him only, and that the workers thereof are 
trespassers on his land.
He also wrote letters to the Queen, the Lord Treasurer, the 
Lord Chief Baron, and other Barons of the Exchequer, praying 
that the injunction respecting the ore dug up on his lands at 
Newlands may be dissolved.
March i6.
Meanwhile, Thomas Thurland writes to the Earl of 
Leicester and Sir William Cecill, and complains of the obstacles he 
has encountered by the Earl of Northumberland.
March 20.
Daniel Hechstetter, writing to the Queen from 
Keswick, complains that the Earl has obstructed the mining oper- 
ations at Newlands.
The controversy between the Earl of Northumberland continued, 
the former rejecting every attempt to come to an arrangement.
May 10.
George Nedham writes from Keswick to the Queen, 
and reports his proceedings on conveying her letters to the Earl 
of Northumberland, requiring the delivery of certain ores stayed 
by him at the mines in Cumberland.
May 25.
George Nedham writes to the Secretary of State, and 
recommends an exchange of certain lands between the Queen and 
the Earl of Northumberland.
Nothing seems to have come of 
this, for we find (August 29) the Earl by his officers objecting to 
the working of a mine called "The Copper Plate," (Ellers, 
Borrowdale,) as not within the compass of Newlands.
It is inci- 
dentally mentioned the quantity of copper which the six furnaces 
will smelt daily.
September 29.
Thomas Thurland writes to the Queen, that 
they have at length attained to making fine and perfect copper, of 
which he sends her a specimen.
He says the mines promise well, 
wanting nothing but workmen.
On the same date, Daniel Hechstetter and Hans Louver write 
to the Queen, that they can now make copper, and have sent some 
to London.
They say they will make trial if the copper ore 
contain silver and gold ; and they conclude by recommending that 
116 
some conclusion be come to between the Queen and the Earl of 
Northumberland.
June 25, 1568.
Keswick.
Daniel Hechstetter writes to Cecill 
that he is surprised at the mineral richness of the kingdom.
He 
complains that the works are opposed by Lady Radcliffe, and says 
that a preacher in their own language is much wanted amongst his 
workmen.
September 2.
Negotiations with Mr. Curwen for a piece of 
ground at Workington, on which to erect a wharf, which was 
finally concluded a month later by Mr. Nedham.
October 19.
The Earl of Northumberland makes a final request 
to Sir William Cecill, whether he is to have a reasonable compo- 
sition for the mines or not ; otherwise he must assert his right and 
title to them.
The judgment of the court was : — " But in regard 
of the Queen's prerogative, there being in those mines more gold 
and silver than copper and lead, they were judged to be due to 
the Queen upon the defendant's demurer in law." 
Thomas Percy was the seventh Earl of Northumberland, anc 
besides his grievance respecting this mine, which was a real one,1 
he also had another of a different character, which seems to have] 
given him great dissatisfaction.
On the i6th of May, 1568, Mary 
Queen of Sc6ts landed at Workington.
Sir Richard Lowther, whc 
was Sheriff of the County and Deputy Warden of the Westeri 
Marches, hastened to meet her, and found her at CockermoutJ 
from whence on the following day he conducted her to CarlisleJ!
The Earl of Northumberland hearing of this, hastened to Carlisle, 
and on the ground that Queen Mary had landed within his Uberty 
of Cockermouth, insisted that he ought to have her in charge, and 
wanted to take her to Alnwick.
To this Sir Richard demurred, 
on which the Earl got into a passion, called Sir Richard "a varlet," 
and used many "evil words" and "great threatnings." 
The Earl got severely reprimanded for his interference, and this 
added another cause for discontent, which eventually found vent 
in bis joining Neville and other rebels in the "Rising of the 
North." He plunged into that wild rebellion, and forfeited his 
117 
estates and his life as the penalty.
A mania for rebellion seems 
to have infected this noble family.
February 26, 1569.
We find Simon Musgrave writing to Cecill 
concerning a plot of ground belonging to Mr. Curwen, near 
Workington, which is required for mineral works, and enclosing a 
plan of the ground required, and the river and town adjacent.
May 15, 1570.
Lionell Duckett writes to Cecill.
"Requests 
that the Queen would be pleased to appoint certain ofificers for the 
superintendence of the copper works.
Recommends Mr. Richard 
Dudley and Mr. Dalston." 
March 24, 157 1.
"The Company of the Mines Royal to the 
Earl of Leicester and Lord Burghley.
Requests that the bargain 
for copper be completed, and also the warrant for discharge of the 
duties on wines." 
March i, 1572.
Johan Louver to Lord Burghley.
Great delay 
caused by the contentious conduct of some of the Company.
Is 
ready to submit his accounts to be examined when Burghley 
thinks fit.
The last entry of these State Papers given by Mr. Lemon is as 
follows :— " (The Council ?) to the Company of the Royal Mines 
in Cumberland.
That Daniel Hechstetter, Work Master of the 
Royal Mines, has made trial of a process invented by Henry 
Pope, for washing of lead and copper ores, and recommends its 
adoption." 
Mr. Daniel Hechstetter appeared upon the scene at the close of 
the year 1564.
The parish register mentions, May 14th, 1572, the 
baptism of a son : "Daniel Hechstetter, son of Daniel Hechstetter, 
Duchman, and Radigunda his wife." He had two other children 
born at Keswick, Elizabeth and Leonard.
He died in 158 1, 
having resided seventeen years in the parish ; and his widow, who 
survived him twenty-nine years, died in 1610.
She was buried in 
the church.
This family flourished and married into the most 
respectable families in the neighbourhood, and continued to hold 
their position so long as the mining operations were carried on.
We find them in influential positions in all parochial matters.
In 
the inquisition taken at Keswick relating to the High School of 
118 
Crosthwaite in 1616, it is mentioned that the Company of the 
Mines Royal gave twenty pounds, and Radigunda Hechstetter 
forty shillings, for the increase of the school stock, and delivered 
the same to Master Daniel Hechstetter, and Emanuel Hechstetter, 
now deceased (whose executor Joseph Hechstetter is), to be paid 
to the eighteen sworn men.
On the 8th of September, 1623, one Daniel Hechstetter got a 
lease for five lives, of the " Heads," a croft of ground, being by 
estimation twelve acres, for himself and for the lives of Samuel 
Hechstetter, Jonathan Hechstetter, and Radigunda Hechstetter, 
all of Keswick, and the longest liver of them, for twenty shillings 
a year.
There is a house in Keswick, next to Captain Jackson's, 
near the bridge, which has thick walls, and is wainscotted with 
beautifully carved oak, and has initials D.
H., a shield, and other 
initials I.
H., which I take to be Daniel and Jane Hechstetter.
His wife's maiden name was Jane Bankes, of Keswick, and this 
property passed down to the present owner from one William 
Bankes, an opulent manufacturer.
One of the family became master of the Grammar School at 
Carlisle.
He was M.A. of Queen's College, Oxford, and rector of 
Bolton, Cumberland, from 1665 to 1686.* Probably he was the 
son of Joseph Hechstetter, of Smelting House, Keswick, who 
married first Joyce Bankes, daughter of John Bankes of Keswick, 
and only sister of Sir John Bankes, Chief Justice of the Common 
Pleas in the reign of Charles I., and the founder of Bankes's 
Charity in this town.
The works were carried on by the side of the river Greta, as 
well as at Newlands, there being smelting houses at both places.!
The works by the Greta river extended from Calvert's bridge toj 
the Hammer Hole, above the Forge.
This is a mill race, a partj 
of which is cut through the solid rock, and forms a tunnel.
It has 
been cut with wedges and pick hammers, in the same manner as 
the levels were driven in the mines at Newlands.
This mill race 
carried the machinery used in smelting, hammering copper plates 
and sawing wood, etc.

An indenture dated 15th October, 1607, between Sir Francis 
Radcliife of Dilston, and the Governors, Assistants, and Society 
of the City of London, and for the Mines Royal, grants a 
lease of twenty-one years to the above-mentioned parties for 
^^63 6s.
8d., "Three acres of ground lying and about the Towne 
of Keswick, between the water of the Greta on the one .side, and 
one certain close of ground commonly called Briggholme-close on 
the other side, within the manor of Castlerigg, with all and singular 
the edifices, buildings, and other works, which were erected, 
builded, or made upon the premises, or thereunto belonging.
Also, a certain parcel of ground called Whyte Moss, being parcel 
of the common cow pasture belonging to his tenants of Keswick 
and Castlerigg workhouse for hammering of copper with a water 
race damd of the same belonging or therewith used to have and 
to hold the above tenements in whatsover the same belonging or 
therewithal used and occupied with all manner of egress, etc., 
through that place or pasture for their necessary working and 
doing.
Yielding and paying ,7{^i2 yearly for the ground and 
houses, and for Whyte Moss ^£4 : and also one water course now 
already made in and through the grounds of the said Sir F.
Radcliffe 
next adjoining the said three acres, the force and head of the said 
water-course beginning and set at Clark Hill /oci, and so wrought 
downwards towards Keswick Mill." 
I have extracted the foregoing from the original lease in the 
possession of R.
Dykes Marshall, Esq., Lord of the Manor of 
Castlerigg and Derwentwater, which he kindly lent me for perusal 
some time ago, with many similar documents throwing light upon 
local matters of interest in past times.
In 1654, Joseph Hechstetter was foreman of the eighteen School 
Governors, and he represented the division of Great Crosthwaite.
The school accounts are in his writing, which is an excellent 
hand.
About this time William Calvert is recorded as foreman of the 
eighteen sworn men, and Gyles Raisley of Windebrow follows in 
the same capacity.
These names are constantly occurring in 
120 
local documents, showing that they were of the German colony, 
and were amongst the more influential portion.
The name of Raisley first appears in our register as follows : — 
"Baptism, 1567, May nth of Benedictus Ritseler, son of George 
Ritseler, Duchman, and Margaret his wife.
The name is succes- 
sively spelled Rytsler, Raysing, Raysell, Raisley of Windebrow — 
which is now called Greta Bank, and did belong to the late William 
Calvert, Esq., J.P., who probably came to it by the union of the 
Raisley and Calvert families, there being two of the latter named 
Raisley Calvert, coming down to our own times.
The earliest marriage recorded is that of Hanre Moser, Dutch- 
man, and Elizabeth Clark of Newlands, November 23rd, 1567.
There was also a Molker Moser of Smelting House, and Percival 
Molker Moser of the same place.
Then we have the names 
Symond Puphbarger of Stare, Fitzin Colizon of Smeltmg House, 
Gesper Cloeker, sometimes spelled Clowker, Closher, and lastly 
Clocker.
Christopher Clocker and Janet Stanger of Skelgill were married 
in 1590.
So early as August 24th, 1567, Andrew Ringreasle, Duchman, 
married Elizabeth Fisher of Seatoller.
In 1572 we have the baptism of " Gasper Cayrus, son of Mitchall 
Kayrus, Duchman, and Agnes his wife." 
In 1568 Christopher Beck, Duchman, married Elizabeth Bewley, 
Englishwoman.
In 1572, February 15th, Sir Peter Beck married Janet Fawsett, 
servant at Isle (He).
The prefix "Sir," was probably given to him 
as clergyman or domestic chaplain, for in 1597 "Master" Peter 
Beck was appointed vicar, having by this time succeeded to his 
master's degree.
He was vicar of Crosthwaite for fifteen years.
Under Daniel Hechstetter, copper smelting became very 
successful at Keswick, and his method of pumping water out of 
mines was far in advance of anything known in England before his 
time.
Since then, however, the Germans have not kept pace with 
England in machinery for pumping mines.
It was computed some 
121 
years ago, that one single engine in England raised more water 
than all the water power in use in Germany.
In a lecture given by Sir Hussey Vivian, Bart, M.P. for 
Glamorganshire, on "Copper Smelting," at the Royal Institution, 
Swansea, December, 1880, he shows that skilled workmen went 
from Keswick to South Wales in 1584, to teach the art of roasting 
and smelting the ore.
In the course of his lecture he says : — " In 
the reign of Elizabeth, there was a rich copper mine at Keswick, 
Cumberland, of which the Queen deprived the Earl of Northum- 
land on the ground that it was a Royal Mine.
It was reported 
that 4000 men were employed at that mine, but this is probably 
a great exaggeration.
According to Camden, much good copper 
continued for a time to be rnade at Keswick and Nevvlands, but 
Webster in 167 1 wrote that now the work is quite left, and decayed, 
yet I am informed that some do now melt forth as much good 
copper as serveth them to make halfpennies and farthings.
I beg 
especially to direct attention to the smelting works at Keswick in 
Cumberland, because I think there is no doubt from the records 
brought to light by the laborious and intelligent researches of our 
fellow-townsman, Lt.-Col. G.
G. Francis, that the first sm.elting 
works in South Wales was built and worked by men from Keswick.
I remember well that Col. Francis announced to me before he 
published his letters, in 1867, that he had discovered that our 
Welsh copper-smelting process came from Germany.
I at once 
told him, and I still retain the opinion, that such could not be the 
case, inasmuch as nothing analogous to it existed in any part of 
Germany down to our times.
I think we were both part right.
The evidence Col. Francis has discovered, puts it beyond doubt 
that Germans were largely employed in the Keswick smelting, but 
there is no tittle of evidence that I can discover, that they brought 
the reverberatory process with them from Germany* 
" In point of date, the story begins with a patent granted by 
Queen Elizabeth in 1564, to Thomas Thurland, Master of the 
Savoy, and Daniel Hogstetter, a German, giving them power and 
authority to dig, search, try, sort, and melt all manner of mine 
stores of gold, silver, copper, and quicksilver, in Yorkshire, Lan- 
122 
caster, Cumberland, Westmorland.
Cornwall, Devon, Gloucester, 
Worcester, and the principalities of Wales, as well within Her 
Majesty's own grounds as others, on payment of a royalty.
In the 
same year a patent was granted to Mr, Humphrey, and Christopher 
Shutes, a German, with similar powers within England and the 
English pale in Ireland, except the places before granted.
Under 
the first patents no doubt the working and smelting at Keswick 
was carried on.
Seventeen years later we find a letter from Mr.
George Needham to Sir Francis Walsingham, setting forth in 
considerable detail the operations which were carried on under the 
directions of one Jochim Gaunse, Ganse, or Gans, for his name is 
spelled three different ways.
This letter is of a most interesting 
character, and contains, I believe, distinct indications of the first 
introduction of the system of copper smelting which has been ever 
since that date so largely practised in this district, and which is 
now more or less adopted in almost every copper producing district 
in the world." 
" I gather from this that the Keswick works were managed by 
Mr. Daniel Hogstetter and Mr. Steinberger up to 1581, when 
Jochim Gans went there, and that this practice had been to roast 
and smelt the oar and regulus.
"On the 2 1 St July, 1584, Thomas Smith writes to Ulrick Frosse 
saying that Mr. Weslin is going to Cornwall through Wales, and 
that he will take measures for transporting the copper ores to the 
new smelting house at Neath in Wales, 'which house I understand 
is ready, and we have taken order that against he shall be ready 
to make copper, we shall have from Keswick one of our copper 
makers and withall an under melter, and the Dutch carpenter for a 
time to serve and ready him in these causes.' 
Now this fixes the exact date of the commencement of copper 
smelting in South Wales, viz., the autumn of 1584; and it shows 
that the skilled workmen came from Keswick." 
I have quoted Sir H.
Hussey Vivian's remarks at length because 
he is a great authority, and stands at the head of the copper 
smelting industry of the world.
i

The lecture has not been published, but it was printed in the 
Cambrian newspaper.
I am indebted to our friend Mr. E.
J. 
Grayson for drawing my attention to the matter, and sending me 
the extract which I have given.
It has often been a subject of speculation what became of the 
German miners when the works were destroyed by Cromwell's 
army.
Nicholson and Burn say that "most of the miners were 
slain in the civil wars : and the works have never since been 
managed to any account." (Vol. ii.
p. 69.) Some lingered in the 
neighbourhood.
Zinogle, Senogle, or Sinogle constantly appear 
in our church books as carpenters down till 1705, when Sebastin 
Zinogle gets for work done at the church, 2S.\ and in 1706, Giles 
Sinogle for work is paid 9J.; and later still the name comes back 
to us from Coniston changed to Snoggles, although the better- 
informed of the family protested against the innovation in spelling 
it.
This circumstance seemed to point to ConistorT mines as a 
place to which some might have gone from Keswick; but on 
referring to West's Antiquities of Furness, I find that he says : — 
•' During the rage of the civil wars, the copper mines in Conistone 
fells were shut up." Still, the name of Yearle, now spelled Earle, 
remains amongst us.
The Becks got to Dalston and the neigh- 
bourhood of Carlisle ; and there is a Norfolk family, who say they 
are descendants of German ancestors.
Senogle is a most respect- 
able name amongst the mechanics of Kendal — following the same 
occupation as their ancestors; and Moser amongst professional 
gentlemen.
Caryus amongst the higher classes in North Lancashire, 
and also the Calverts and Raisleys both in East Cumberland and 
elsewhere.
There are are thirty-six baptisms of the children of the 
Hechstetters recorded in the parish register.
The Hechstetters 
married into the most respectable families.
Daniel married Alice 
Anderson of Keswick.
Mr. Percival Radcliffe, of Keswick, 
married Elizabeth Hechstetter in 1653.
In the following year, 
November and, 1654, he was appointed vicar of Crosthwaite, in 
succession to the Rev. William Meoles, who died May, 1653.
His name is recorded in the register as having been appointed by 
184 
" Oliver, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, 
Scotland, and Ireland, for the preaching of the word of God." 
But the Germans furnished two vicars previous to this, viz., 
Robert Beck, who became vicar in 1592, and in 1597 he was 
succeeded by "Mayster" Peter Beck, who resigned in 1602, and 
the living was given by Dr. Robinson, Bishop of Carlisle, to his 
brother Dr. Giles Robinson, who made himself obnoxious by 
committing thirteen of the eighteen school trustees to prison 
because they refused to accept his nominee (one Garth) as school- 
master.
Mrs. Thomasine Hechstetter married George TuUye of Keswick.
His son was Dr. Thomas Tullie, Doctor of Laws, Dean and 
Chancellor of Carlisle, Rector of Aldingham, and J.
P. for Cumber- 
land.
The time, however, would fail me to tell of the Herringes, the 
Stonebargers-, the Franses, the Mures, the Colegeaths, the Woulfes, 
the Pellers, the PauUes, the Ringreasles, the Raisleys, the Flouter- 
ers, the Staygills, the Beyrnparkers, the Prowkers, the Lipmawers, 
the Sanningers, the Torvers, the Yorkes, the Norspalmers, the 
Tifflers, the Tiblers, the Yossers, the Hedglers, the Upperers, 
the Tempps, the Shrohomes, the Rynders, the Lacepalmers, 
the Zinogles, and a host of others, all to be found in the 
Crosthwaite register, and each distinguished as Germans by the 
word "Duchman" being added to the entry.
It is interesting to put together these scanty fragments of local 
history, and to trace the influence which this little colony of 
German miners and their works had upon the manners and the 
material prosperity of the people of this parish.
No doubt the 
new industry gave employment to a great many of the poorer 
inhabitants in the mines, and at the smelting houses.
We have 
seen that the strangers did not receive a cordial welcome from the 
Cumberland folk, as is shown by the complaints of Daniel Hech- 
stetter.
He complained that the Earl of Northumberland obstructed 
the mining operations in Newlands, and that the workers were 
opposed by Lady Radcliffe.
We have seen that Queen EHzabeth 
commanded the Earl to offer no further obstruction, telling him 
125 
that any lawful claim he might have should be reserved to him.
The Queen also commanded Lord Scrope (then Lord of the 
Marches), and the Justices of the Peace in Cumberland and 
Westmorland, to repress the assaults and outrages on the miners 
who had come there to search for minerals.
Moreover, the 
Queen gave a commission to Thomas Thurland and Daniel 
Hechstetter to apprehend disorderly persons employed by them in 
the mines.
We get a glimpse of the spirit which animated Daniel Hech- 
stetter, when writing to the Secretary of State on June 25th, 1568, 
when he says, "a preacher in their own language is much wanted 
among his workmen." If the law would not reduce the people to 
order, he recommended the preaching of the Gospel.
We also see the part which the Hechstetters took in the affairs 
of the ancient Free School.
They aided that institution, which 
had been founded by the people of this parish "time out of mind," 
before^ the year 157 1, when "the Sealer and Receiver of the 
Queen's Majesty's portion of the mines, and one of the chiefest of 
the Company and Fellowship of the Partners and Offices of 
Minerals then resident at Keswick," were always to be present at 
the annual election on Ascension Day of the eighteen sworn men 
of the parish.
There can be no doubt that the material prosperity of the parish 
of Crosthwaite was increased by these works.
We may trace 
another great benefit to this neighbourhood arising from the 
increased opulence of the trades people, and of the yeomen on 
their small holdings.
John Bankes was a wealthy tradesman, the 
second son, I believe, of William Bankes of Castlerigg.
He built 
the house now used as the mail-coach office, and the premises 
extended to the King's Head passage.
He sent his only son, 
John Bankes, to Oxford, where he studied for tlie legal profession.' 
On leaving college he entered at once upon his professional 
career, and by his great industry and ability he rose rapidly to 
distinction.
He became Solicitor-General, Attorney-General, and 
finally Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and was knighted.
He had an only sister, who was married to Joseph Hechstetter 
126 
who succeeded his father, Daniel Hechstetter, in the management 
of mines.
We find that Joseph Hechstetter and Francis Hech- 
stetter of Keswick, together with John Bankes, son of WilUam 
Bankes of Castlerigg, with others to the number of sixty, tenants 
of the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater, joining together to 
enfranchise their lands and tenements from arbitrary fines to fine 
certain, for the sum of ;^i44i, paid to Sir Edward Ratcliffe and 
his brothers Francis and Cuthbert Radcliffe.
This was in the year 1623, just when John Bankes|was in 
practice, and as he is a witness to the deed, we may fairly conclude 
that the Hechstetters and the Bankes took a principal part in 
bringing about this arrangement.
We need not stop to speak of 
the incalculable advantage which this enfranchisement brought to 
the neighbourhood by abolishing arbitrary fines, and creating them 
customary freeholds.
The old tenure was at once''a source of 
impoverishment to the tenant, and a bar to all improvement to 
the lands and buildings.
Is it assuming too much to say that indirectly we are indebted 
to the rise of Sir John Bankes from the yeoman^class, through the 
prosperity of his father, occasioned by the introduction of this 
new industry ?
Sir John Bankes did not forget his native place, but by his will 
left property to create another industry, but which, in consequence 
of the unsettled state of the country consequent on the civil war 
then raging, was never put in force.
The Charity, however, 
remains a memorial of his liberality, and affection for his native 
place.

THE BOTANY OF THE CALDEW VALLEY.
By WILLIAM HODGSON.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
As a native of the valley, I felt it would be well to commit to 
paper a few of the most noteworthy fragments of botanical inform- 
ation collected during a period extending over more than half a 
century.
Of the many valleys ramifying from the Lake District as 
a centre, the one now under notice is equalled by few in picturesque 
loveliness.
Viewed from the rugged summit of Carrock, whence 
the whole course of the river may be traced through its devious 
winding along the Valley, from the slopes of Warnel on the west, 
of Hewer Hill or of Lower Broadfield on the east, or from the 
crest of Thornthwaite Hill, we are struck with the agreeable alter- 
nations of timber and pasture grounds, until we approach the 
grand parkhke scenery that surrounds both Rose Castle and Holm 
Hill.
The sylvan growth here has undergone considerable modifications 
within my recollection.
Hundreds of magnificent forest trees have 
disappeared from the stations they once adorned.
That the 
Valley has ever been richly wooded is, I think, obvious from the 
number of place-names in the district— such as "The Oaks" (two), 
"The Ashes," "The EUers," "The Birks," "The Willows" (some- 
times "The Wythes"), "The Hollins," &c.
Descending even to 
shrubs, we find "Hawthorn Cottages," "Hazel Springs," "Gill 
Whins." 
128 
Now a word as to the extent of the drainage area of the Caldew 
Valley.
Roughly stated, it would include the whole or major part 
of Caldbeck, Sebergham, Castle Sowerby, Ivegill, Raughton Head 
and Gaitsgill, and Dalston, besides portions of both Greystoke and 
CarUsle.
Before passing on to speak of the wild flowers, I desire to offer 
a few remarks on the timber trees of the Valley.
Looking at the 
woods of Heggle, of Warnel, of Sebergham, of Rose Castle, of 
Holm Hill, &c., the most common timber tree is undoubtedly the 
Oak. Most of you, I dare say, are acquainted with those three 
venerable trees in the park below Rose Castle, which were 
unquestionably in existence long before the wardenship of Ingle- 
wood was an extinct office.
Until near the close of the last 
century there grew at Thistlewood several gigantic oaks, the finest 
of which, on their falling victims to the woodman's axe, was 
transported to Egremont with no little difficulty, there to be utilised 
as the main axle or shaft in the machinery of a paper mill.
The 
"Fletcher Guards" oak, which stood about two miles lower down 
the same stream, and which, I believe, was purchased by my 
grandfather, was also a mighty member of the same family.
On 
the Rose Castle and Holm Hill properties several splendid oaks 
fell victims to the fury of the terrible gale of January 7 th, 1839, 
still remembered as the "great wind." The Sacra Banks oak (on 
the latter estate,) was a tree of great size and extent of shade.
The other chief timber trees are the Ash, Broadleaved Elm, 
Sycamore, Alder, Birch, Scotch Fir (fine examples near Rose 
Castle), the White Willow, and the Crack Willow.
Of less frequent 
occurrence are the Beech, the Narrow-leaved Elm, the Aspen and 
other Poplars, the Horse Chesnut, and the Larch.
Of the manner 
in which forest trees may sometimes be propagated, the following 
illustration may serve as an interesting example.
The letter, dated 
1709, was written to a friend by the Rev. Thomas Robinson, 
vicar of Ousby, under Crossfell, is as follows :— 
About twenty years ago, coming from Rose Castle early in the morning, I 
observed a great number of crows very busy at their work upon a declining 
ground of a mossy surface.
I went out of my way on purpose to view their 
129 
labouring, and found they were planting a grove of oaks.
They first made 
little holes in the earth with their bills, going about and about, till the hole was 
deep enough, and then they dropped in the acorn, and covered it with earth and 
moss.
This young plantation is now fast growing up to a thick grove of oaks, 
soon to be fit for use, and of height sufficient for them to build their nests in.
I told it to the owner of the ground, who took care to secure their growth and 
rising.
I will now proceed to summarise as concisely and accurately as 
I can, in the order adopted in the London Catalogue, the plants 
which I have personally noted as existing in the Caldew Valley, 
commenting here and there upon such as may rarely be met with 
in other districts of the county, or which may be regarded as 
casuals, waifs from cultivation, etc.
First, then, of the Ranunculus, or Crowfoot family.
Thalidrum 
flavum, Common Meadow Rue, a plant of unusual occurrence in 
this county, grows in the railway cutting a little to the west of 
Dalston station.
The Wood Anemone is tolerably abundant quite 
up to the mountains.
The commoner species of Crowfoot 
(Buttercups) are also plentiful.
Trollius europmis, The Mountain 
Globe-Flower, a very handsome species, in moist meadows, 
towards the head of the Valley.
Aconitum tiapellus, Monk's 
Hood, grows by the river just above its confluence with Roe-beck, 
on the east bank, — probably a garden outcast from higher up the 
stream.
Three species of Poppy are commonly found in corn- 
fields, on rubbish heaps, &c.
Of the Fumitory family, the pretty 
little creeper, Corydalis claviculata, White-flowered Fumitory, with 
its weak straggling stems, may be found among the rocks and 
huge fragments thereof, which everywhere thickly bestrew the foot 
of Carrock.
Ramping Fumitory grows about Gatesgill.
Of the very numerous tribe of Crucifers, the Valley produces 
only the commoner types of Charlock, Wild Mustard, and Wild 
Rape, indiscriminately classed by the farmer as "fieldkail." Arabis 
hirsuta.
Hairy Rock-Cress, grows in joints of limestone about 
Park Head, Sebergham.
Cochlearia officinalis, Common Scurvy- 
Grass, occurs in rills on Skidd aw Forest and Carrock ; where also 
C. alpina, the Dwarf alpine species, may be found.
Teesdalia 
nudicaulis, Naked-Stemmed Teesdalia, on the top of a dry wall 
9 
130 
near Swineside, above Mosedale, and probably also among the 
screes on the neighbouring fell.
Draba verna.
Spring Whitlow- 
Grass, many thousands on Dalston Green.
Of the wild Migno- 
nettes, Reseda luteola, Dyer's Rocket, on loose soils, rubbish heaps, 
&c., about Sebergham, frequent.
HelianthemutJi vtilgare, Common 
Rock-Rose, about Park Head.
Of the Violace^e, or Violet Tribe, 
the only rare example is Viola odorata, v.
alba, the Sweet-Scented 
Violet, which grows on the banks of the Roe-beck, from High 
Bridge down almost to its junction with the main river.
Of the 
Sundews, Drosera rotmidifolia^ the common, or Round-Leaved 
species abounds in every mountain bog ; D.
intermedia, the Long- 
Leaved Species, a comparatively rare plant, also grows by a wayside 
ditch near Stone Ends farm, Mosedale.
Passing now to the Caryophyllace^, or Pink family, and 
omitting the commoner Catchflies, Chickweeds, &c., we come to 
Stellaria nemoriwi, Wood Stitchwort, which grows in an old orchard 
at Flatbank farm, Gatesgill.
Arenaria serpyllifolia, Thyme-Leaved 
Sandwort, is not unfrequently met with on turf-topped dry walls, 
towards the head of the Valley.
Spergula arvensis, Corn Spurrey, 
is of far too frequent occurrence in cultivated grounds in the same 
quarter; especially where drainage has been neglected, or when 
the season has been wetter than usual.
Of the Purslane order, 
Montia foniana, Water-Blinks, holds a place in almost every 
"well-eye" or "totterbog/' among the hills.
Several members of the St. John's Wort family are indigenous 
to the Valley; but none of them is of unusual occurrence elsewhere.
Of the Mallow family, Althaa oMcinalis, Marsh Mallow, grows 
frequently about old dwellings, and is a plant of some repute with 
cottage herb doctors.
Malva moschata, Musk Mallow, rather a 
handsome species, is fairly plentiful, rooting deeply into sandy or 
light gravelly soils.
Fine examples occur about the ballast pits 
near Dalston station.
Lintmi catharlicum, Purging Flax, is abundant 
in many parts of the district.
The wild Geranium order.
This tribe has many representatives 
amongst us, the most conspicuous being the fine dark blue 
Geranium pratense, Meadow Cranesbill, in the lower portions of 
131 
the Valley; and Gercmium sylvaticum, Wood Cranesbill, with 
lilac- or light-crimson corolla, in upland meadows and hedgerows.
Erodium cicntarium, Hemlock Stork's-Bill, appears sparingly about 
Dalston Green.
Several unimportant families that stand next in the Catalogue 
are totally absent, or, at least, sparingly represented.
The Common 
Holly grows freely in the higher part of the Valley ; and in the 
vicinity of Heggle is a frequent ornament in hedgerow and copse.
The LeguminifeRjE, or pod-producing plants, sometimes styled 
the papilionaceous order, from their butterfly-shaped blossoms, 
number about eighty species in all, exclusive of varieties.
These 
include the Whins, Brooms, Trefoils, and Vetches.
The Common 
or spring-flowering Whin is abundant everywhere ; and the dwarf 
Vlex gallii is plentiful in the neighbourhood of Durdar, and the 
lowest skirts of what was once Broadfield Common.
Equally well 
known is the Common Broom, while, here and there, especially in 
the Haltcliffe district, the dwarf Genista tinctoria, Dyer's Green- 
Weed, finds a place.
In addition to the ordinary species of 
Trefoil common in Cumberland, Trifolium arvense, the Hare's-Foot 
Trefoil, usually a seaside plant, flourishes in abundance on Dalston 
Green.
Of the Vetch tribe you may find Vicia hirsuta, the 
Hairy-Podded Tare, among the loose gravel a little west of Dalston 
station.
The most noteworthy of the family is, however, Vicia 
sylvatica, the Wood Vetch, really a most elegant plant.
I first 
met with it in a young larch plantation near the abandoned 
Sebergham colliery, at the outskirts of Denton Side woods.
By 
means of its powerful tendrils it had managed to climb and overtop 
the larches, and from the summits, some eight or nine feet from 
the ground, there depended large clusters of drooping flowers, 
white, tinged with light crimson or blue, which had a most charming 
effect.
Another most extensive order now claims attention, viz., the 
RosACEiE, which, besides the roses proper, includes the Tormentils, 
Strawberries, Brambles (a most perplexing family), Crabtree or 
Wild Apple, Pears, Hawthorn, &c.
Singling out the most remark- 
able for passing notice, Primus insititia, the BuUace or Wild Plum, 
132 
is fairly plentiful about Flat Bank, near High Head Castle, and 
farther up the same valley.
The splendid Black Cherry* trees that 
grow in the park near Warnel Hall are the finest I have ever met 
with, attaining a growth equal to most timber trees, and in some 
seasons producing a large quantity of excellent fruit.
Spircea 
aiipendula, Dropwort, has been noticed in the fields immediately 
below Dalston, by the footpath to Cummersdale — perhaps a doubtful 
native.
Poierium saiiguisorba, Salad Burnet, in joints of the lime- 
stone about Parkhead.
Alcheinilla alpina, Alpine Ladies' Mantle, 
among rocks and screes on Carrock Fell.
Comarum palustre, 
Purple Marsh-Cinquefoil, boggy pools on Mosedale Moss.
The 
Wild Raspberry is common.
The Red-Fruited Bramble occurs 
sparingly in Denton Side, as does also the Dewberry.
The Cloud- 
berry is reported to grow in Skiddaw Forest, but this I cannot 
vouch for personally.
Probably half-a-dozen roses are indigenous, 
but none of a rare character have fallen under my notice.
Of the 
Wild Pear tree, a solitary specimen stands near Gatesgill, by the 
lane leading to Brackenhowe.
The Crabtree or Wild Apple is 
familiar to every schoolboy.
Lythriiin salicaria, Purple Loose Strife, occurs in boggy places 
towards the fells.
Its tall spikes of light purple flowers are 
remarkably elegant.
The Willow Herbs are well represented.
The two giant types, the Narrow-Leaved and the Great Hairy 
Willow Herb, may both be seen in the grounds at Holm Hill, while 
"well-eyes" on Carrock and other fells produce the tiny Chickweed- 
Leaved species.
In elegance of outline or delicacy of colouring 
it loses nothing in comparison with its taller and more showy 
brethren.
Both the British forms of Enchanters' Nightshade may 
may be gathered in the fell district ; where, also, several species of 
Stonecrop occur, notably, the Biting Stonecrop and the Orpine.
Of the same family, Cotykdoti tunbiliais, Navelwort, was discovered 
a few years ago by Canon Carr, in a lane near Buckabank.
This 
species is rare in Cumberland.
Saxifrages, for the most part, are 
* A letter just received from J.
G. Baker, Esq., F.R. S., of the Royal 
Herbarium, Kew, contains the following expression : "Your Lakeland Cherries 
want more working at." 
confined to the mountains, where many species flourish in great 
beauty and abundance ; and among the wet uplands also grows 
the'' handsome Grass of Parnassus.
This is a late flowering 
species.
Many members of the umbelliferous family, as the Spotted 
Hemlock,'^ Water Hemlock, "deed tung," and Fools' Parsley, have 
an uncanny reputation as poisons more or less deadly.
I remember 
when a schoolboy, being elected to fill the post of huntsman in a 
game of "hare and hounds." Of course I must have a hunting 
horn.
A robust stem of Heracleiim sphondylium, Hogweed, grew 
quite handy, and was quickly utilised for the- purpose, which it 
served admirably.
The consequences were decidedly unpleasant.
For ten days or more my lips were in a painfully chapped and 
excoriated state.
On explaining the cause to an aged neighbour, 
his remark was — " Served you right ; you will use the Smooth 
Kesh next time you want a hunting horn !" I believe the man 
was right.
The Smooth Kesh, or Wild Angelica, has certainly 
less irritating juice than the plant I had used.
Of the Caprifoliace^, or Honeysuckle tribe, the very pretty, if 
lowly, little Adoxa moschatelUfta, Tuberous Moschatel, may be 
found in the early months of the season on old hedgebanks ; and 
in autumn the showy red and waxlike fruit of the Guelder Rose is 
a conspicuous ornament of many a coppice and hedgerow.
Several 
species of Galium may be found in different parts of the Valley.
The majority of them are in perfection about midsummer.
Scabiosa 
columbaria, Mountain Scabious, usually a tenant of calcareous up- 
lands, is found as low down the Valley as the park at Holm Hill, 
gj)ssibly brought down by the river from the higher limestone 
district.
Its congener, the Devil's-Bit, is almost ubiquitous.
A 
local name for this species is "Hog-a-back." The largest of the 
family, the Field Scabious, grows vigourously in some very poor 
soil at the back of Warnell Fell, between Park Head and Parson's 
Park.
Its lilac-coloured flowers are sometimes nearly as large as 
some of the asters of our gardens, to which they bear a close 
resemblance.
We now arrive at the extensive order of composite plants, wliich 
134 
includes Thistles, Camomiles, Groundsel, Daisies, Cudweeds, 
Hawkweeds, &c.
Cardmis crispus.
Nodding Thistle ; a variety of 
this species, known by some botanists as C.
acanthoides, or Welted 
Thistle, is occasionally found in the hedges of cultivated fields 
from Sebergham downwards.
The Carline Thistle on dry banks 
at the base of the mountains.
The Corn Blue-Bottle, Centaurea 
cyatius, sometimes occurs in cornfields, where it has been imported 
probably among the seed corn.
The same remark is applicable 
to the Corn Marigold, Chrysanthemum segetum.
The Common 
Wormwood, Artetnisia absinthium, formerly covered portions of 
Dalston Green, where I fear it is now all but extinct, from the 
demands made upon it by cottage "medicine men." At this last 
mentioned station the least of the local Cudweeds appears in 
abundance.
Of the Groundsel tribe, the largest and least known 
in Cumberland is Senecio saracenicus, Broad-Leaved Ragwort, a 
patch of which grows close to the river by the roadside leading 
from Sebergham to Bell Bridge.
Another extremely rare plant, 
the exact locality of which I cannot venture to divulge, as even 
now I fear its extermination is imminent, is Erigerott acris.
Blue 
Fleabane.
I have heard of its existence near Cummersdale, 
though I found it growing farther up the stream.
Cichorium 
intybus, Chicory, now and then makes its appearance in fields 
recently laid down to pasture ; possibly its seeds were mixed with 
samples of rye-grass or clover.
Tragopogon pratensis, Meadow 
Goats-Beard, though more frequently met with than the three last 
mentioned species, is yet unusual.
Of the thirty-six British Hawkweeds, only about six may be 
fairly set down as indigenous.
The Pennines produce far more 
examples than the Cumberland group of hills.
Of the Blue-bells, 
or Campanulace^, we find four species.
The least known to city 
botanists is probably Campanula glomerata, Clustered Bell-FIower, 
which has terminal heads of large dark purple flowers ; a native 
commonly of calcareous soils.
Parkhead, scarce.
Of Heaths and mountain Berry-bearing Shrubs, the following 
may be found on Carrock, Skiddaw, Bowscale, or Caldbeck fells, 
viz., the Cranberry, Cowberry, or Red Whortleberry (ripe fruit not 
135 
by any means plentiful), Bilberry (fine examples near Bowscale 
Tarn), and Crow-berry, the Ling-berry of shepherds {Etnpetrum 
nigrum), though this last belongs to a different order.
The Bog- 
Whortleberry is also reputed to grow here ; but, if so, I have not 
yet seen it.
The Fine-Leafed and the Cross-Leafed Heaths, as 
well as the Common Ling, once so much used for besom-making, 
are all abundant.
A white flowering variety of the Ling is not 
unfrequent on Broadfield.
Of the Gentian family, Gentiana 
campesfris, Field Gentian, an autumn flowering species, with blue, 
or purple-tinted flowers, grows on Parkhead.
I have also seen it 
on Middlesceugh pasture.
Menyanthes trifoliata, the Bog-Bean, of 
great repute among rural herbalists as a stomachic, bears one of 
the handsomest flowers I have ever seen, native or foreign.
Found 
in deep boggy ground.
Hyoscyattius niger, Black Henbane, said 
to be an exceedingly virulent poison, grows on rubbish heaps 
occasionally on the village greens of both Caldbeck and Dalston.
Of the Figwort tribe, Verbasciim thapsus, Mullein, Shepherd's Staff, 
occurs at intervals in gravelly ground by the Caldew from Sebergham 
downwards.
Linaria cymbalaria, Ivy-Leafed Toad-Flax, must 
long have been established in the Valley, where it is abundant on 
old walls about ancient dwellings ; Z.
repens, Creeping Toad-Flax, 
might have better claims to external origin.
A small patch of this 
species grows by the roadside between Buckabank and the river.
Of the Speedwells, the Ivy-Leafed species, which flowers early, 
abounds about Buckabank.
Buxbaum's Speedwell, a far finer, as 
well as more rare species, grew some years back on a heap of 
builder's rubbish close to the houses at Dalston.
Of the Broom 
Rape family, that curious and elegant parasitic plant, Lathrcea 
squamaria, or Toothwort, has of late seasons been noticed upon 
the roots of elm and other trees on both sides of the Raugh, near 
Gatesgill.
Of the Labiate order, which comprises all the Mint, Marjoram, 
and Dead-Nettie tribe, about sixty species in all, not including 
varieties, brief notice must suffice.
Four species of Mint may be 
set down as of common occurrence.
Specimens of Nepela cataria, 
Catmint, have been recently gathered in the lane leading from Bell- 
136 
Bridge to Sebergham Hall, by Mr. W.
Duckworth.
Wild Thyme 
and Basil appear on dry uplands; while Ground Ivy, Wood Betony, 
and Bugle, belong rather to woodlands and sheltered hedge-banks ; 
a remark that is applicable also to Wood-Sage.
Several species of 
Myosoiis, Forget-me-not, are not unusual; some in running water, 
while others prefer dry banks.
Comfrey, never perhaps truly wild, 
finds a place about the boundaries of old gardens and orchards.
The common Hound's Tongue used to grow not far from 
Hawksdale Bridge.
The common Butterwort and Primula 
farinosa, the Mealy Cowslip — both lovers of moisture — are found 
by mountain springs.
The latter is the Bonnie Bird Een, of the 
dalesman.
Lysirnachia nummularia, Money Wort, the Creeping 
Jenny of London flower girls, is found at the foot of the Scar, 
Gatesgill ; Z.
nemorum, Wood Loose-Strife, in Flatbank orchard ; 
and Z.
ciliata, an excluded species, by the roadside near Monkhouse 
Hill, Sebergham.
Three species of Plantain frequently occur.
The Goosefoot family include several well-known garden weeds, as 
well as Chenopodium bonus-henricus.
Good King Harry, or Mercury 
Goosefoot, formerly in use as a culinary vegetable, though now 
superseded by Spinach, which belongs to the same natural order.
Of the Rumex or Dock family, in addition to the Round-Leafed and 
Curled Docks, the plague of farmers, the Bloody- Veined Dock is 
not unfrequent about Gatesgill.
Polygonum bistorta, Snake-weed, 
Eastermer Giants, grows in a wild state in meadows about Haltcliffe 
Bridge.
Many species of the Spurge family are shore plants, atfd, 
therefore, wanting in the valley; where only two seem truly 
indigenous, the Sun Spurge, and the Petty Spurge.
They are all 
remarkable for the yellow acrid juice contained in the leaves and 
stems, supposed to be efficacious in removing warts from the hands.
In ground under tillage, and abounding most among green crops, 
the Stinging Nettles, both annual and perennial, are familiar every- 
where.
Amentiferous, or Catkin-Bearing plants, are tolerably numerous.
The Oak, Alder, Beech, Hazel, Poplars, and Willows, all belong 
to this order.
Of the first I have already spoken.
The Willows 
share with the Brambles, Hawkweeds, &c., an xmenviable noto- 
137 
riety.
The different species approximate sometimes so closely 
that their correct indentification is a very difficult task.
Many 
species adorn the banks of the stream, from the gigantic Crack 
Willow, Salix fragilis, which, near Gatesgill, attains a height of sixty 
or seventy feet, to the dwarf Salix herbacea, three or four inches in 
height, which grows almost at the summit of Skiddaw.
Other preva- 
lent species are the sweet Bay-Leafed Willow, the White Willow, 
with its variety S.
vitellina; the Long-Leafed Triandrous and Purple 
Willows ; the Common Osier, the Long-Leafed Sallow, the Grey, 
and Wrinkled-Leafed or Round-Eared Sallow, the Round-Leafed 
or Great Sallow, the dark Broad-Leafed Willow, and the Creeping 
Willow, all tolerably distinct species.
Of the Conifers, the Common 
Juniper grows on Carrock, where also occasional specimens of Yew 
are to be met with.
Pond-weeds are plentiful enough, but limited 
to a ver)- few species.
Potamogeton crispus, Curled-Leafed Pond- 
Weed, abounds in the river.
Triglochin palusire, Marsh-Arrow 
Grass, in uplahd meadows, where moisture is super-abundant.
Of 
native Orchids, the most noteworthy are the pretty little Orchis 
iistulata, Dwarf Dark -Winged Orchis, which displays its elegant 
maroon-coloured blossoms, in a meadow known as Fletcher-guards, 
by Roe-beck, a little below Raughtonhead ; and Habcnaria viridis, 
Frog Orchis, among the rocks about Parkhead.
Epipactis latifolia, 
Broad-Leafed Helleborine, occasionally shows itself in the vicinity 
of the river; where, too, the Wild Daffodil and the Snowdrop 
flourish in early spring.
Lilium mariagon, Turk's Cap, a garden 
escape probably, occurs in the Morell Wood, opposite Holm Hill.
The same wood also produces the Alliutn vineale, or Crow Garlic.
The Lancashire Bog Asphodel is, often conspicuous in wet 
meadows adjacent to the hiUs.
Li the upper part of the Valley, next to the mountains, a good 
many members of the Juncace^ can be found.
The following 
species of Liizula appear, viz : Z.
pilosa, Broad-Leaved Hairy 
Wood-Rush, in shady woods ; Z.
sylvaiica.
Great Wood-Rush, in 
gills ; Z.
campestris, Field Wood-Rush, is nearly ubiquitous ; 
Z. multiflora, v.
cofigesta, Many-Flowered Wood-Rush, is also of 
common occurrence on elevated and moist heaths.
The Rushes 
138 
proper, or Junci, are more numerous.
The clayey summit levels 
of Broadfield, Hewerhill, and Warnel, are over-run with beds of 
J. glaucus, Hard-Rush ; while J.
effusiis, Soft-Rush, the delight of 
juvenile "sievy-cap" makers; y!
aciitiflorus, Sharp-Flowered Jointed- 
Rush, Closs of our dalesmen ; and J.
sqtcarrosus, Moss Rush, 
Goose Corn, are all of them plentiful, the last mentioned being 
found only on the wettest and most exposed moorlands.
At least 
six other species are natives of the Valley ; of these, J.
bufonius, 
Toad-Rush, is possibly the best known, being found by moist 
ditch banks all along the Valley.
The family Cyperace^, which includes Club Rushes, Sedges, 
and Cotton-Grasses, is a somewhat extensive one.
One of its 
ablest exponents at the beginning of the present century, was the 
late Dr. Goodenough, bishop of Carlisle, whom I can just remember 
seeing at Rose Castle.
The following list includes most of the 
species that I have been enabled to identify.
Most of them 
belong to the fell district.
Scirpus palustris.
Creeping Spike-Rush, 
in boggy ditches ; S.
multicaulis, Many-Stalked Spike-Rush, turfy 
ground and wet commons, slenderer than the preceding plant; 
S. ccespitosus, Scaly-Stalked Club-Rush, turty heaths almost to the 
very top of Carrock ; S.
fluitans, Floating Club Rush, in pools on 
Mosedale Moss, rather unusual ; S.
setaceus, Bristle-Stalked Club- 
Rush, found sometimes plentifully by the edges of gravelly-bottomed 
mountain rills; S.
sylvaticus, Wood Club-Rush, in upland meadows, 
and by the edges of slow-running streams : the flowering stems are 
frequently half a yard high, and as thick as a lady's ring-finger.
Of 
the Cotton-Grasses, EriopJwrii?n vaginaium.
Hare's Tail Cotton- 
Grass, and E.
polystachion ox angustifolium.
Common Cotton-Grass, 
are not unfrequent on moors.
Of the Carices, or Sedges proper, 
about twenty species may be claimed as natives of the Caldew 
Valley.
C dioica, Creeping Separate-Headed Sedge, having the 
male flowers on one stem and the female florets on another, is 
found sparingly in deep spongy bogs.
C. pulicaris, Flea Sedge, 
abounds in bogs, and derives its name from its peculiarly shaped 
dark brown smooth and shining fruit.
C. tereiiuscida, Lesser 
Panicled Sedge, a somewhat rare plant, occurs in boggy meadows : 
139 
I found fine examples of this sedge last summer in Newton Moss, 
near Penrith.
C. panicidata, the Greater Panicled Sedge, a plant 
of very robust growth : the stems, often more than two feet high, 
spring from hassocks of large size; only found in perfection in deep 
spongy bogs.
C. muricata, and C.
stellulaia, the Greater and the 
Lesser Prickly Sedge, are both to be found ; the former sparingly, 
while the latter is common in almost every pasture.
C. remota, 
Remote Sedge, with rather pretty drooping spikelets, frequent in 
ditches and under hedgerows in shady ground.
C. ciirta, White 
Sedge, occasionally shows itself in watery pastures.
C. ovalis, 
Oval-Spiked Sedge, one of the more common Carices.
C. acuta, 
Slender-Spiked Sedge, a much more conspicuous plant than the 
foregoing, with several drooping stems about two feet high ; by 
sikes and pools, not very uncommon.
C. vulgaris, Tufted Bog 
Sedge, very common ; in some instances exclusively occupying large 
patches of ground.
C. glauca.
Glaucous Heath-Sedge, the Pry or 
Blue Gers of haymakers in the dales, who greatly dislike it; it is 
difiScult to cut except with a keen-edged scythe, and not very manage- 
able when, in its dried state, it passes into the hands of the "lader"; 
common in all high-lying meadow and pasture ground.
C. pilulifera.
Round Headed or Pill Sedge, may be found sparingly on upland 
moors.
C. proecox.
Vernal Sedge, seems to be much less dependent 
on moisture than its congeners, sometimes appearing on the dry 
slopes of a mountain, or on a hedge bank in the valley.
C. panicea, 
Pink-Leaved Sedge, in boggy meadows not unusual.
C. sylvatica.
Pendulous Wood Sedge, common in woods, and frequently occur- 
ring lower down the valley than the species already enumerated.
C. binervis, Green-Ribbed Sedge, varies much in size according to 
locality ; on some dry heaths in the Lake District it is very 
abundant.
C.fulva, Tawny Sedge, I have frequently seen in our 
best meadows, associated with a class of herbage quite superior to 
the surroundings of the Carex family as a rule.
C. flava, Yellow 
Mountain Sedge : in every fell runner or small stream this plant is 
of common occurrence up to an elevation of two thousand feet 
and more above the sea level ; the variety b.
lepidocarpa is not 
unfrequent.
C. hirta, Hairy Sedge : this sedge is not limited, like 
HO 
many of the preceding species, to the upland part of the Valley, 
but occurs by the edges of the Robeck and Caldew on both the 
Rose Castle and Holm Hill estates.
C. amfullacea, Slender- 
Beaked Bottle-Sedge : a very common species in many parts of 
Cumberland in marshy pools and by river sides.
The above list 
includes all the species that I have noticed within the limits of the 
Valley ; but I regard it as far from exhaustive, having a conviction 
that others of the family would be found on careful search.
The Gramina, or Grasses, occv^py the next position in the 
Catalogue, but as I have specially treated upon them in a paper 
already published in the Society's Transactions^ Vol. V., it would 
be superfluous to travel over the same ground.
I would, however, 
mention that since the volume in question was issued, I have had 
specimens of Poa alpina, Alpine Meadow Grass, gathered on 
Skiddaw, kindly forwarded to me by Mr. W.
Duckworth of Stanwix; 
and I have myself found Poa nemoralis, Wood Meadow Grass ; 
Festuca sylvatica, Wood Fescue ; and Bromus commutattis, Meadow 
Brome Grass, in different parts of Cumberland.
I hardly look 
upon the last mentioned as indigenous here.
A few remarks on the local Ferns must conclude the present 
paper.
The indiscriminating and reckless rooting up and carrying 
off our rarer species, has rendered the true lover of plants chary 
of divulging the stations where he has noted their growth.
The last 
letter I ever received from my late venerable friend and corre- 
spondent, Mr. W.
Dickinson of Thorncroft, lamented this plant 
slaughter, and he strongly urged me to be very reticent on such 
matters.
I now look upon this recommendation as the dying 
injunction of a gentleman who, in many and varied phases of the 
study of Natural History, was an honour to his native Cumberland; 
and whose decease has left a blank among us that will not readily 
be filled up.
Adhering to the plan adopted in the previous notes, I remark 
that Eymenophyllum unilaterale, Wilson's Film Fern, our smallest 
local species, may be found in many of the gills on both Skiddaw 
and Carrock.
Pteris aquilina, Common Brakes, universally known 
Ul 
as Brekins, abounds in dry ground in every part of the Valley.
Cryptogramma a-isjm, or, as it is frequently designated, Allosorus 
crispus, Parsley Fern : this handsome species, which is the object 
of much curiosity to those who, living in valleys and flat neighbour- 
hoods, have never seen it in a wild state, flourishes in luxuriant 
abundance on the Skiddaw group of fells.
The same may be said 
of Lomaria spicant, Hard Fern, with the addition that it frequently 
occurs on the edges of Broadfield, and in sandstone gills about 
Gatesgill and Sebergham ; one of the most widely-distributed of 
all our British ferns.
As2)lenium ruta-muraria, Wall Rue : on 
walls and rocks ; in fruit all the year round, and not limited to any 
particular part of the Valley.
A. septentrionale, Forked Spleen wort : 
a very local species, so nearly exterminated that its discovery may 
be regarded as a capital find ; rocks about waterfalls are its chosen 
haunts, though sometimes seen in front of dry rocky scars at a 
considerable elevation.
A. trichomanes, Common Spleenwort : 
the finest examples are found in crevices of rocks that overhang 
or inclose forces on the hills.
A. viride, Green Spleenwort : a 
much rarer species than the preceding, and anxiously sought after by 
visitors, is rapidly diminishing in supply; (chiefly occurs in the moist 
crevices of calcareous rocks [Ed.]) A.
adiantum-nigrum, Black 
Spleenwort : widely distributed among the rocks of Caldbeck fells 
and Carrock, and sometimes to be found as a hedge-bank plant 
farther down the course of the river.
Athyrium Jilix-fonmina, Lady 
Fern : common in sheltered situations where moisture is abundant.
The variety rhceticum is also of frequent occurrence.
The two 
forms may sometimes be observed growing side by side.
Ceterach 
officinarum, Common Scale-Fern: this, like the Green Spleenwort, 
has suffered extensively from the greed of collectors, and is now 
looked upon as a rarity ; fortunately it is not easily extirpated ; I 
have known stations denuded of every root, but where in a few 
seasons it was found flourishing afresh.
Scolopendrium vulgare, 
Hart's-Tongue : on moist shady walls, in deep gills, and similar 
places ; often very fine on the inside walls of well tops, with the 
fronds, or the tips of them, inclining towards the water.
Cystopteris 
fragilis, Brittle Bladder-Fern : on moist rocks and about the bases 
142 
of old walls, this elegant little fern is fairly plentiful.
The variety 
b. dentata is occasionally met with.
Aspidium lonehitis, the Holly 
Fern : of this plant I can only speak from report ; its existence on 
Carrock has frequently been alleged, but I have never met with it 
there ; as my informants were trustworthy persons, I regard its 
presence there as very probable.
A. aculeatum and A.
lobaium 
Prickly Shield Fern, I am tempted to think only slightly divergent 
types of one species ; I have found both forms of this fern from 
Gatesgill upwards ; on the lower slopes of Carrock one of them 
grows luxuriantly.
Nephrodium filix mas, Male Fern, Meckans 
or Meckins of the dalesmen ; a large and robust fern, plentiful 
everywhere.
The variety c.
borreri is perhaps the only type readily- 
distinguishable from the normal one.
^. spinulosum, which some 
botanists look upon as merely a casual variety of the foregoing 
species, is found in moist woods towards the head of the Valley, 
as also about the bases of the mountains.
N. dilaiatum, Broad 
Prickly -Toothed Fern : another large fern of very varying character, 
like some last mentioned species, is found abundantly in shady woods ; 
some speciallyfine plants occur in the woods near High Head Castle.
i\^.
oreopteris, Mountain Buckler Fern : not uncommon.
Polypodium 
vulgare, Common Polypody : this fern, well known as an occupant 
of old walls, stumps and roots of trees, rocks and shady places, 
abounds everywhere, clothing the edges of rocky prominences on 
Carrock with a fringe of green foliage, which has a striking effect, 
especially in the depth of winter.
P. phegopteris, Beech Fern : 
appears in shady and slightly-moist places in many parts of the 
Valley ; it abounds in Denton Side woods.
P. dryopteris, Oak 
Fern : is a common inhabitant of rocky woods, especially in beds 
of screes, where its slender wiry roots creep about in every direction; 
the finest specimens occur in the vicinity of forces, though generally 
speaking this species shows less affinity for moisture than the 
Beech Fern.
Ophioglossum vidgatum, Common Adder's-Tongue : 
in upland meadows, where a cold clayey subsoil prevails, this 
curious little plant is more frequent than is generally imagined ; 
it springs late in the season, and dies down early; from the middle 
of May to the beginning of June is the best season for observing 
143 
it ; in pastures it is quickly cropped by cattle, and in meadows 
speedily overtopped by the other herbage, when it becomes difficult 
to make it out, as its fronds differ little in shape from the leaves of 
the Devil's-Bit Scabious, their almost constant neighbour.
Botry- 
chium lunaria, Moonwort : towards the summit of Warnel, about 
Park Head, sparingly.
Of Club-Mosses, or Lycopods, a goodly array may be found on 
the slopes of the mountains.
Some, indeed, flourish in the black 
peat which covers the summits of Carrock and other fells.
The 
following species occur : Lycopodium clavatum, Club Moss, Stag's- 
Horn of the shepherds ; L.
alpinum, Alpine Club-Moss ; L.
selago, 
Fir Club-Moss; L.
inundatum.
Marsh Club-Moss; and Selaginella 
selaginoides, Prickly Club-Moss.
The EguiSETACEiE, or Mare's-tail tribe, has the following repre- 
sentatives, viz : jEquisetum arvense, Field Horsetail : in wet fields, 
banks of rivers, and similar places; Filly-tail, Tyad-pipes, &c., of 
the dalesfolk; a troublesome weed, and extremely difficult to 
extirpate, its roots penetrating to a great depth.
Equlsetum maxi- 
mum, or E.
telmateia, Great Horsetail, is said to grow in Denton 
Side or Parson Park; but I cannot vouch for the fact.
E. sylvaticum, 
Wood Horsetail : not uncommon in the upper part of the district, 
in meadows where moisture is abundant.
E. palustre, Marsh 
Horsetail : is sparingly found in sikes and in boggy ground.
E. limosum, Smooth Naked Horsetail : is rather an aquatic than 
palustral plant, usually growing in stagnant water.
E. hyemale, 
Dutch Rushes, or Shave Grass, the last of the family, is one that 
I have never seen within the Valley, but which is very likely to be 
found about such places as Mosedale Moss.
The CharacEjE.
Cha/ra syncarpa, or, as it is now called, 
Nitella opaca, Smooth Chara, is commonly met with in ditches 
and boggy stagnant pools, where it is probable that other species 
may be discovered.
The Chara family have not long been 
enrolled in the columns of the London Catalogue, and the 
different species are now being arranged under a new system of 
classification.
144 
I have thus briefly, and I fear inefficiently, endeavoured to bring 
before the members of the Carlisle Scientific Society and Field 
Naturalists' Club, a compendium of the botanical productions of 
"Cauda's sweet vale," in the hope that it may lead to further 
investigations in the same direction.
The labour has been to me 
a ftiost congenial task, and has sufficed to call up pleasant 
memories of many a ramble by woodland copse and mountain 
glen in days long by past.

PROFESSOR ROBERT HARKNESS, F.R.S., F.G.S.
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, of the Geol.
Survey of England.
(Read at Penrith.) 
Introduction, 
The principal events in the life of a man of science offer, as a rule, 
so little that is of interest to the world outside the circle of his own 
friends and acquaintance,that the advisability of placing them perma 
nently on record may, in many cases, well be called in question.
Even 
where he happens to have largely influenced public opinion by 
means of well-known and widely-read books, the general public 
are apt to feel very little interest in any account of the principal 
events in the career of the author himself, unless, of course, these 
events are known to possess in themselves some degree of interest 
approaching to the dramatic.
In most cases this indifference will 
be found to arise from the fact that the subjects principally treated 
of do not happen, as a whole, to relate sufficiently to any one 
particular locality to cause the permanent association of the author's 
name with that of the principal scene of his labours.
Where, how- 
ever, a man has exerted a considerable degree of influence upon 
scientific opinion by an important series of scientific contributions 
relating to any definite area, the history of his labours becomes 
equivalent to a history of the science he has helped to advance, 
and under that aspect may justly claim to possess, for the people 
of that area, at least, an interest of something more than the 
ordinary kind.
That this was the case with the man of science of whose history 
10 
146 
I am about to give an outline is already well known.
Professor 
Harkness's original memoirs relating to the Geology of the Basin 
of the Solway rank among some of the most important contributions 
to geological literature of their time.
It is not going too far to 
say that there was hardly a single branch of geological knowledge 
relating to that district that he did not directly or indirectly con- 
tribute to, and contribute in such a way, that the results of his 
labours have formed a most important part of the foundation 
whereon all subsequent memoirs relating to the geology of that 
part have themselves been based.
He possessed also, a most intimate acquaintance with the 
topography of a very large area of the same district, and indeed, 
might fairly have laid claim to have known more about the 
geological structure, the fossils, the minerals, and the natural 
features of Cumberland and Westmorland than any one man ever 
possessed before his time ; or, it may be safe to prophecy, than 
any one man, even in these days of facile locomotion, will ever 
possess again.
Besides what he did in the way of bringing so many parts of 
our district permanently under the notice of the scientific world, 
Professor Harkness's connection with Cumberland, which dates 
back from the year 1849, enabled him to give practical expression in 
many other ways to the warm interest he felt in everything relating to 
the advancement of scientific knowledge of any kind.
We have 
good evidence of this in the series of lectures on various subjects 
that he gave in connection with Mr. Gordon and Mr. Tannahill, 
in the earlier days of what is now the Penrith Scientific Society.
There is no need for me to do more than refer to his readiness in 
communicating any of the information in his possession to his 
fellow-workers, whether they were already men of good standing in 
the scientific world, or whether they were only just beginning to 
turn their attention to science at all.
In this respect his claims 
upon the regard of men who have since made for themselves names 
well-known throughout the scientific world have been again and 
again gratefully acknowledged.
Deeds speak louder than words it is said, and therefore, instead 
147 
of presuming to lay before you any statement of my own individual 
opinions regarding his personal character and the position his 
works occupy in the ranks of geological literature, I propose to 
make a departure from the rule usually observed in biographical 
essays, and to treat the subject in two sections, giving now, in the 
first, a brief outline of the principal external events of his career, 
gathered from sources whose authenticity is not likely to be called 
in question.
In the second part, wherein I feel sure that at least 
an equal degree of interest is likely to be felt, I propose hereafter 
to trace the history of each of his several contributions to geological 
literature, pointing out its position in relation to the labours of his 
fellow-workers, so that the history of opinion upon each subject 
treated of may be placed in as clear a light as possible.
Where 
the papers relate to districts beyond the Basin of the Solway, and 
have no bearing, direct or indirect, upon our local geology, a brief 
allusion will be all that need be given.
In the remaining cases I 
propose to give an epitome of all the facts and observations he has 
placed on record relating to the Geology of the Basin of the Solway, 
taking the papers in the order of the rocks they refer to instead of 
chronologically, and giving especial prominence to such as he 
might himself have reproduced in the form of a Geology of Cum- 
berland and Westmorland.
Part I.
Professor Harkness was born at Ormskirk, Lancashire, on the 28th 
July, 1 81 6.
After acquiring some elementary education at home, also 
at a school in the neighbourhood, he was placed with Dr. Duncan, 
minister of Greyfriars, Dumfries, and was educated along with 
Dr. Duncan's sons.
After some years study he entered the Uni- 
versity of Eduiburgh, and attended the lectures of Professor 
Jamieson, the well-known exponent of the Wernerian School of 
Geology, as well as those of the equally well-known geologist 
Professor J.
D. Forbes.
After leaving Edinburgh, Mr. Harkness returned to Ormskirk, 
with the intention of entering into a well-known firm.
Peak Brothers 
and Co., India Merchants, London.
Circumstances prevented 
148 
his doing so.
In the meantime he was by no means idle.
The 
interest aroused in his mind by the teaching he had received at 
Edinburgh was constantly being increased by the practical study 
of the geological features of the country around him.
Geology 
was then in its infancy, and consequently very little had been 
written about that district ; but what had been written he seems to 
have taken every opportunity of reading, as was his almost-constant 
practice in regard to any other district he was studying in after life.
But he did not remain content with mastering the stock of inform- 
ation at that time available; on the contrary, he appears, with 
characteristic originality, to have set to work at once to bring his 
knowledge to bear upon some of the many tlien-unsolved problems 
that arrested his attention in the district around him.
It is not easy nowadays to realise the full extent of the <]ifficulties 
that, forty years ago, the pioneers of Geology had to contend with.
At the present day we have the most remote parts of the kingdom 
rendered easily accessible by modern improvements in locomotion.
Good maps, admirable text-books, and first-class teaching, are 
within the reach of nearly everyone : so that the modern student 
may easily gain possession of more ready-made knowledge in a few 
years than the fathers of our science would have found it possible 
to acquire by constant study through a long life-time.
In the year 1843 appeared Harkness's first communication to a 
scientific society.
This was read before the then-youthful Geo- 
logical Society of Manchester, and was printed that same year in the 
"Annals of Philosophy." This treated of the Climate of the Coal 
Period, a subject that probably suggested itself in connection with 
the nature of the rocks in the neighbourhood of his birthplace.
In 
this, his first essay, Harkness advanced views that, as the Editor of 
the Geological Magazine has remarked, were advocated anew by Dr.
Sterry Hunt* after an interval of close upon a quarter of a century.
Another paper read before the same Society shortly afterwards, and 
published in Vol. viii.
of their Transactions, dealt with the Glacial 
Theories advanced by Professor Agassiz.
Both of these, although 
more or less theoretical in character, have important bearings upon

the Geology of Cumberland and Westmorland, and will therefore 
be referred to again in the second part of this paper.
The same 
remark applies to the paper he wrote in conjunction with another 
well-known geologist, Mr. E.
W. Binney of Manchester, on the 
Fossil Trees of St. Helens, which was published in the Philosophical 
Magazine for 1845.
The year 1845 saw also the publication of the 
first of his numerous contributions to the Journal of the Geological 
Society.
This treated of the occurrence of fossils in the Boulder 
Clay, and was followed, the next year, by another discussing the 
causes that have led to the variations in level of the ocean relatively 
to the surface of the land.
In 1848, the family went to reside in Dumfries, where, amongst 
rocks so entirely different in nearly every respect from the rocks 
within easy distance of Ormskirk, he found abundant scope for 
investigation of a different kind.
The crushed and contorted 
Silurian rocks of that part had hitherto seemed to offer to geologists 
a most unattractive field of research ; for, with the exception of 
Sedgwick, who had begun a series of traverses and had collected 
some fossils just before Harkness went there, hardly any geologist 
had made more than an attempt at unravelling the intricate structure 
of that very difficult tract.
Harkness, it appears, set to work at 
these at once, and by the time the British Association met at 
Edinburgh, in 1850, he had succeeded in obtaining a general idea 
of the structural characteristics of that part, and had, concurrently 
with Sedgwick's fossil collector, the afterwards well-known John 
Ruthven of Kendal, succeeded also in collecting from the anthracitic 
schists of the Moffat rocks many new forms of Graptolites and other 
fossils, whose very existence in these rocks had only just before 
been made known by Sedgwick.
Sedgwick's account of his own 
finds, which was given when his specimens were exhibited at the 
meeting of the British Association referred to, stimulated Harkness 
to further exertions, and soon after the termination of the meeting 
he sent his specimens to the celebrated palaeontologist, Mr. J.
VV.
Salter, to be named.
Thenceforward his interest in these singular 
organisms continued unabated through the remainder of his life.
The almost unrivalled collection of Graptolites made by him, and 
150 
since presented to the Carlisle Museum by his sister, Mrs. Pearson 
of Penrith, will ever remain as a memorial of his long-continued 
and patient researches in this direction.
Harkness's first memoir 
on these fossils appeared shortly afterwards.
But along with the rocks just referred to, occur, on the northern 
side of the Basin of the Solway, other rocks more familiar to him 
at that time than the Silurians could have been.
Harkness was 
evidently struck with the general resemblance between this tract of 
New Red Rocks, and the one he had just before been studying 
in Lancashire.
The study of the phenomena observable in the 
one threw more or less light upon the geological relations of the 
other.
Accordingly, seeing the New Red of the neighbourhood of 
his birthplace by the help of the additional light he had just gained 
in Dumfries, Harkness again turned his attention to the subject, 
and, at the meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh, just 
now referred to, after reading a paper on the "Position of the 
Footsteps in the Bunter Sandstone of Dumfriesshire," we find him 
following the subject up with a Notice of the Occurrence of a 
Tridactylous Footmark from the Bunter Sandstone of Western 
Point, Cheshire, which formed the first of his contributions to the 
"Annals and Magazine of Natural History." I have referred to 
these two papers at some little length for two reasons.
The first 
is that, as the paper on the New Red of Dumfries was read at the 
same meeting of the British Association where Sedgwick was 
exhibiting the Graptolites from the Moffat rocks M'Coy had just 
named for him, the great master of Palaeozoic Geology, ever ready 
as he was to come forward with generous aid to any fellow-worker, 
could not fail to have had his interest aroused in the author of a 
paper relating to that tract of New Red Rocks whose eastern 
extension in Cumberland and Westmorland he had himself lately 
been writing about.
And we have evidence that the friendly 
relations thus commenced remained unaltered to the day of Sedg- 
wick's death.
In 1849, Harkness paid his first visit to Cumberland.
From 
that dale his name was destined to be permanently associated with 
the Geology of the North of England.
151 
The first of his papers on the Silurian rocks of the Basin of the 
Solway saw the Hght early in 1851, in the pages of the "Journal 
of the Geological Society," and this was quickly followed up by 
three or four others on allied subjects, which will be found enumer- 
ated in their chronological order in the second part of this paper.
Also appeared several other articles on the New Red Rocks of the 
same district in quick succession, each one adding to the author's 
scientific reputation, and bringing him more and more into com- 
munication with the foremost men of science of that day.
Amongst the numerous letters from well-known geologists now 
in Mrs. Pearson's possession is the following note from the 
Professor of Geology — or Reader in Geology, as he was called — 
at Oxford, Hugh Strickland, who had just filled the post vacated 
by the well-known Dr. Buckland.
Tewkesbury, April 3, 1851.
Dear Sir, 
I am much obliged for your attention in sending me your papers on 
Dumfriesshire.
You seem to be working out that district in good earnest, and you will 
doubtless extend still further our knowledge of the organic remains of the 
Silurian Rocks, as well as of the Red Sandstone.
I am, dear Sir, yours truly, 
H. E.
STRICKLAND.
R. Harkness, Esq.
The next letter is from the celebrated continental geologist, 
Joachim Barrande, whose writings on the Older Palaeozoic Rocks 
and fossils of Bohemia rank amongst the foremost contributions to 
our knowledge of the geology of the older parts of the series.
9 Juin, 1851.
Mon cher Monsieur, 
J'ai recu par I'entr'amite de M.
Salter une suite de Graptolites 
d'Ecosse que vous avez eu la bont6 de m'envoyer.
Je vous en remercie ; elle m'est tres agr6able et me sera aussi tres utile pour 
6tablir des comparisons avec mes especes Boheme.
Je crois que vous rendez un 
veritable service a la science en cherchant les fossiles d'une contrge si peu connu 
et si interessante pour les geologues.
Je ne doute pas que vous ne d6couvriez encore, soit de nouvelles espece de 
graptolites, soit d'autres fossiles, si vous continuez vos recherches, surtout si 
152 
vous 6tes assez heureuse rencontrer soit des lames, soit des sph^roides calcaires 
au milieu des schists.
Les calcaires, en Boheme, dans la meme position, sont 
tres riches, et j'gspere qu'ils existent dans votre pays, comme dans celui que 
j 'explore.
Je me propose de vous envoyer une suite de graptolites de Boheme lorsque je 
serai chez moi, c'est a dire, dans 2 ou 3 mois, parceque je vais a Paris passer 
quelque temps.
Si je pouvais donner quelque renseignments que vous fftt agr€able, je vous 
prie de disposer de moi.
Je serai aussi charme de savoir si vous dScouvrez de nouveau fossiles.
Agrgez, Monsieur, &c., 
J. BARRANDE.
The suite of Graptolites of Bohemia here referred to was sent, 
and these, along with some of Harkness's earliest finds, after 
travelling many hundreds of miles in passing from one geologist 
of eminence to another, are now preserved in the fine collection 
presented to the Carlisle Museum by his sister, Mrs. Pearson of 
Penrith.
I have intentionally passed over several of his papers that 
appeared prior to the close of 1852, chiefly because the details can 
be more conveniently treated of hereafter.
But that their value 
was well recognized by his contemporaries is perfectly evident from 
the fact that, when, in the early part of 1853 the chair of Geology 
at Queen's College, Cork, became vacant, and Harkness was 
applying for that professorship, we find his appUcation supported 
by some of the most eminent of the geologists of that day.
That other geologists were interesting themselves on his behalf 
is well shewn by more letters that are lying before me as I write 
this.
Amongst them may be read the following from Sir Roderick 
Murchison, whose active advocacy of Harkness's claims forms 
perhaps one of the highest testimonials to his ability as an investi- 
gator of the geology of the Palaeozoic rocks that could well be 
brought forward.
20 April, 1853.
My dear Sir, 
You have probably heard before this reaches you that you are named 
to the Chair at Cork.
If not, I beg to tell you that I had this day a letter from the Lord Lieutenant 
153 
telling me that in consequence of what I told him before he left London 
confirmed as it was by other qualities, that he had named you.
Do not make me appear to be instrumental, for I still have enemies elsewhere, 
but I am bound to adhere to so good a Silurian as yourself 
Ever yours sincerely, 
R. I.
MURCHISON.
So in 1853 we find Harkness duly installed as Professor of 
Geology at Cork, a post that he filled with honour to himself and 
advantage to the geological world for just a quarter of a century.
The same year he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society, 
a title that, in those days, was not conferred without discrimination 
upon almost any candidate prepared to pay the requisite fees.
Harkness's removal to a district as different in the details of its 
geological structure from that of the Basin of the Solway as this 
was from the scenes of his first field work, gave him additional 
opportunities of extending his knowledge of the older rocks ; and 
he had not been long at Cork before we find him bringing his 
previously-acquired knowledge to bear upon the new problems 
that there lay around him waiting for solution.
The first published 
results of his investigation in this new field appeared under the 
title of the Geology of the Dingle Promontory, which he soon 
followed up by another on the Cleavage of the Devonians of the 
South of Ireland.
These, together with a paper on Coal, and 
another on Mineral Charcoal- — both containing contributions of 
some value — appeared in the " Edinburgh New Philosophical 
Journal," shortly after his appointment to the Chair at Cork.
The 
scientific value of these papers was at once recognized, and in the 
year 1854 Harkness's name was enrolled along with the long list 
of scientific worthies that then formed the Royal Society of Edin- 
burgh.
Early in the year 1854 a circumstance occurred that gives us a 
good insight into Harkness's inner nature, and the motives that 
influenced him in many of his dealings with the outer world in 
after life.
Sir Henr}' De la Beche, the famous geologist that really 
laid the foundation of the Geological Survey of the United King- 
dom, wrote to Harkness, offering him an appointment under the 
154 
East India Company, as Professor of Geology at the Engineering 
College of Roorkee, in Northern India.
To a man of Harkness's 
tastes this offer must have been a most tempting one, for not only 
were the proferred terms satisfactory in every respect, and the 
climate there well suited to the constitution of Europeans, but 
Harkness would have had a splendid opportunity of extending his 
knowledge of his favourite science in directions hardly attainable 
by geologists whose field work is confined exclusively to the rocks 
of the British Isles.
Moreover, little or nothing had hitherto been 
written about that part, so that altogether, the new field presented 
to any man that, like Harkness, was gifted with the power of 
rapidly taking in structural details in the field, and, in the house, 
equally gifted with the facile pen of a practised writer, an offer that 
must have appeared so advantageous, that the considerations that 
would induce him to decline it must have been weighty indeed.
What those considerations were may best be gathered from the 
following reply : — 
Cork, 30th Jany., 1854.
My dear Sir Henry, 
I feel very deeply indebted to you for your great kindness in affording 
me an opportunity of accepting or refusing the situation of Professor of Geology 
at Roorkee, and I am sorry that, after taking the matter into due consideration, 
I am obliged to do the latter.
Although I should gladly avail myself in improving my present position, 
I am induced to decline the situation you have so kindly offered me for the 
following reasons : — 
isl.
I conceive that, had my health been such as to have enabled me to stay 
in India a sufficient time, on my return I should have found myself an old man 
deprived of all the pleasures which my stay in India would have led me to look 
forward to, for I should know home and British friends only as I had left, and 
find both greatly changed when I returned, and consequently my anticipations 
would be so far disappointed that home under such circumstances would afford 
me little pleasure — a matter which I have too often observed in long residents 
in India on their return.
2!.'d.
A life spent in India would deprive me of those opportunities which I 
enjoy in this country of coming in contact with those whose pursuits are of a 
kindred nature to my own, and also of the facilities I enjoy of acquiring inform- 
ation on my favourite subject ; and although the district of Northern India 
furnishes an almost unbroken field for geological investigation, I think that, 
155 
without the means of coining into contact with individuals having similar 
objects in view I should lose a great advantage which I possess by a residence 
in Europe.
yd.
And probably the most potent reason which induces me to decline is 
that, having no nearer relations than a sister, with whom I have hitherto spent 
my life, I believe that, without her compahy I could not in any way relish 
India : and to endeavour to induce her to accompany me would, I conceive, be 
to do her a great injustice, and therefore this matter has weighed with me 
considerably in my decision.
Taking these different circumstances into consideration, I feel constrained to 
decHne your advantageous offer, which I would otherwise gladly have accepted.
Should anything else occur in which you may think my services of value, I 
shall be most happy to render myself available if it lies in my power to do so ; 
and returning you many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me in this 
matter, 
I remain, my dear Sir Henry, 
Yours truly, 
ROBT.
HARKNESS.
So Harkness remained amongst us, and it was well for us that 
he did, for his stay here enabled him to still further follow up his 
discoveries amongst the older rocks of the Basin of the Solway ; 
which seem to have presented a more attractive field of research 
than even their equivalent strata in the South of Ireland.
Sir William Jardine was about this time interesting himself in 
the study of the fossil footprints of the nondescript animals that 
left their tracks upon the half-consolidated silt that, in New Red 
times, formed the sand banks in the great inland sea then extending 
over these parts.
Harkness, also, was continuing his early work in 
the same direction, and we find him in correspondence with Sir 
William regarding the nature of some of the very singular impres- 
sions and enclosures found in the New Red of Dumfries, and in 
that of Edenside as well.
Regarding some of these, which 
Harkness evidently thought might represent the dermal scutes or 
some other portions of the armour of one of the earlier forms of 
crocodiles, we find Sir William writing from Jardine Hall, under 
date 7th November, 1854, and expressing the doubt existing in his 
own mind regarding the precise nature of many of these problem- 
atical markings, and offering at the same time the suggestion that 
156 
some of them may have been due to particular conditions of dried 
or of drying mud.
The markings of the kind referred to may be 
met with in tolerable abundance in some parts of the New Red of 
Edenside, especially in the St. Bees Sandstone ; and they are well 
worth attentive study, whatever view one may be disposed to take 
regarding their origin.
Sir William had, some time before, brought out his " Ichnology 
of Annandale," wherein he had figured some of the more remark- 
able of the impressions that were obviously vestiges of the 
air-breathing animals of that remote period.
But in regard to the 
origin of many of the others both he and Harkness had long felt 
unable to offer any satisfactory explanation, and it was with the 
object of obtaining further information regarding them, quite as 
much perhaps as the hope of discovering additional specimens of 
the markings themselves, that led him about this time to turn his 
full attention to that part of the remaining fragments of the deposits 
of New Red age that obviously once connected the Dumfries 
outliers with the New Red of the adjoining parts of the North of 
England.
Harkness did not by any means allow his knowledge of other 
branches of geology to remain unused, and we find him still 
working hard, now at one subject, now at another, all having 
more or less direct bearing upon the Geology of the Basin of the 
Solway.
One result of his work in this direction was that his 
claims to one of the highest distinctions conferred by any scientific 
society upon men that have contributed to the advancement of 
science, were beginning to be fully recognized amongst the leading 
men of the metropolis.
The following characteristic letter from 
Sir Roderick Murchison sufficiently proves this point : — 
M.P.G., 26 April, 1856.
My dear Sir, 
I am happy to tell you that I have just heai'd that you are one of the 
four geologists whose certificates I signed who have been selected out of the 
candidates for Election as F.R.S.
I congratulate you, and tell you honestly that you are very fortunate ; for I 
really did not think that you would succeed the first year, particularly as you 
were appointed with other good geologists who had longer claims.
157 
I hear that the large admission of the Knights of the Hammer is due to the 
fact that there were Doctors they wished to keep out.
Ever sincerely yours, 
R. I.
MURCHISON.
The same year that saw Harkness's election to the Fellowship of 
the Royal Society saw also the publication of at least six more 
contributions of his to the literature of Geology, each one containing 
the results of his own original research ; results that were generally 
recognized as distinct additions to the stock of real knowledge.
Most of these relate to Geology outside the part of England we are 
here more immediately concerned with ; but the facts and opinions 
they contain have, nevertheless, important bearings upon our local 
geology, and, as such will be more fully referred to in their proper 
place.
But Harkness was just then turning his attention in real 
earnest to the solution of some of the most difficult problems that 
man ever attempted to work out in the geology of the Lake District 
proper.
Otley, Sedgwick, and others had already grappled with 
them, and had succeeded, after many traverses across what were 
then the most-inaccessible parts of the Lake District, in arriving at 
something like a general idea of the structure of the whole.
But 
Otley had just died, and Sedgwick himself was growing too old to 
be able to carry on much further the work he had himself already 
done so much to advance.
There was still a very great deal to 
be done, many more facts had to be collected and carefully com- 
pared by the light of all the knowledge that had been rendered 
available by the labours of others, before the geology of that part 
of Cumberland and Westmorland could be reduced to anything 
like systematic order.
The work was of the most arduous nature- 
involving the making of a long series of observations over ground 
mSst difficult to traverse.
Fossils are rare ; sometimes not to be 
found even after days of diligent search ; the straligraphical relations 
of the rocks are obscured by cleavage, by metamorphism, or by an 
endless series of dislocations.
Thousands of feet of climbing had 
to be done, hammer and note book in hand, with perhaps day 
after day very little return for the exertion expended, before it was 
possible to advance the work much beyond the stage attained by 
158 
the collective labours of the older workers.
Not many men could 
be found with enthusiasm sufficient to enable them to carry out 
this object, and of the few that possessed that requisite only a 
small number possessed also the requisite experience in working 
out the structures of similar areas elsewhere.
All the help that 
could be gained from the experience of former labourers in the 
same field was required to be brought to such a task as this ; and 
Harkness, always ready as he was to compare notes with other 
workers, was little disposed to neglect any opportunity of making 
himself master of all the available information bearing upon his 
subject.
It is equally characteristic of Sedgwick that, when he 
found a worker able and ready to carry on the work beyond the 
point his own researches had helped to bring it to, should unhesi- 
tatingly come forward and place the results of his own experience 
at the disposal of his fellow-worker.
The following letter from Sedgwick to Harkness will serve to 
illustrate this point : — 
August 29, 1856.
My dear Sir, 
Your letter has been long in waiting me, so I fear the information I 
can send you may come too late to be of any use.
(i.) I advise you to go to Kendal and to call on John Ruthven, the well- 
known collector of our northern palaeozoic fossils.
He knows the country well, 
and he is the only person, so far as I know, who has found fossils in the Skiddaw 
Slates.
(2.) You may procure Hudson's Guide to the Lakes, and in some letters 
published in an appendix to it you may see a general account of the several 
formations, though I am not sure that there is any notice of the Skiddavf Slate 
fossils and their localities.
(3.) 11 old Jonathan Otley, author of an excellent Httle book, be still living, 
(I saw him last year when he was turned ninety,) he can give you good advice 
as to localities ; and so can Charles Wright, one of the Keswick guides \iffio 
went with me on some of my excursions in 1824.
Since that year I have hardly 
looked at the Skiddaw Slates.
You should look at the new Black Lead works 
somewhere behind Saddleback, I do not remember the name of the locality 
[Bannerdale Mine.
J.G.G.] though I saw it in 1823 along with Jonathan Otley.
These works are I suspect, not in a vein, but in a variety of anthracitic slate, so 
they will give you a form of comparison you are looking for.
I found black slates in the Skiddaw Slates group from wliich the dark carbon- 
159 
aceous colour was discharged by heat.
Hence I concluded that such beds very 
probably would contain fossils.
So I set Ruthven to work, and he found 
graptolites and fucoids not far from the spots I pointed out to liim, but he found 
no shells nor crustaceans.
Since then I have had some doubt about the age of 
the Skiddaw group.
It is of enormous thickness, and may well contain one or 
two groups of very distinct epochs both physically and palseontologically.
(4.) When you are seeking Skiddaw Slate, I recommend you to take up your 
quarters at the inn at the foot of Crummock Water.
I should have been there 
now but for an attack of English cholera * * I hope [soon] to get to Dent, 
and thence to the locality of the Lakes, where Professor Rogers has engaged to 
meet me.
* * Hammer well the gritty rocks which appear in the several deep ravines 
which run up the mountains on the left side of the road from Scale Inn to 
Buttermere.
They promise well for fossils.
I never examined tliem for fossils 
in 1823 and 1824, because I foolishly thought they were all below the region of 
animal life.
At that t'mte I had not quite learned to shake off the Wernerian 
nonsense I had been taught.
There is a hill somewhere in Cumberland called Whiteless, I think near 
Crummock.
I never heard of its fossils, neither do I know anything of the 
"flaggy beds of Balmae" you mention in your letter.
Pray write to me on this 
subject at "Dent, near Kendal," the best address I can give you.
Visit Black Combe in the S.
W. comer of Cumberland.
This is of Skiddaw 
Slate brought up by enormous dislocations, and its ravines are of good promise.
To the south it is overlaid by the Green Slates and Porphyries, well marked, 
but of degraded thickness.
And over the Green Slates you have, in the 
S. Western extremity of Cumberland the Coniston Limestone, &c., and some 
appearances in the cleavage planes which I think defy the mere pressure theory.
That there has been enormous compression along the cleavage planes no one 
can doubt when the fossils are flattened and distorted.
But they are not always 
flattened and distorted — you have to account for unflattened concretions marking 
(tho' rarely) the average direction and dip of the cleavage planes.
You have to 
account for the frequent change of cleavage, and if, when the * * tchange 
of conditions of pressure indicated in the sections, and you have to account for 
a second cleavage plane among beds that are by no means crystalline.
I was, most unfortunately, away when Sorby read his paper at Cheltenham.
(6.) Visit Coniston, and look at the enormous dislocations, etc.
Mr. James 
Marshall would help you to localities.
You have there, as also at Broughton- 
in-Furness, which you pass through on your way from Black Coomb to Coniston,) 
the Coniston Limestone and the Coniston Flags, or the Coniston Grits which 
form the boundary between a Lower and an Upper system — by whatever name 
you choose to call them.
t This part of the letter was quite illegible.
160 
If these hints be of any use I shall rejoice.
I shall very soon be called off to 
Scarborough to consult the doctor, so I write in much hurry.
You tell me about your Scotch axis, the South side of which you suppose may 
match with the North side of Cumberland.
"Where and what is your axis ?
I never found it ; and I had promised to go with Professor Rogers to seek it.
Murchison, I think, told me that Professor Nichol had found it ; but I forget 
where.
In 1848 I made some traverses through the S.
chain of Scotland, and 
collected from the "Moffat Group." I once thought it might represent a part of 
the great Skiddaw Group ; but I now doubt it very much, and I would rather 
provisionally place it at the base of the Lower Bala Group* where there is in 
Wales a great deposit of dark slates, here and there with many graptolites.
Over the Moffat Group comes on a great arenaceous and slaty group which I 
think undoubted Upper Bala, with one well known calcareous band, and 
overlaid unconformably by the Old Red Sandstone.
Below the Moffat Group I placed a hard, old-looking, arenaceous and slaty 
group (such, for example, as that which runs out in Barrow Head), but I 
wanted good sectional evidence, so my sections were only hypothetical, and the 
most stupid and mischievous of all proceedings is to name the groups and give 
them a definite place before we know the sections.
I am still a little sceptical 
about your Wenlock Beds at Balmae.
My fossils from them do not settle the 
point at all.
If, however, the old published list be correct, they must be 
Wenlock twisted up in the contortions of the older rocks.
I fully expected in 
1848 to have found overlying true Silurian rocks towards Barrow Head.
I ran 
down there for one day, and, of course, saw no Silurian rocks.
For any 
information on this point I shall be thankful when you write to me.
On the N.
side of the Cambrian cluster we have : — 
1. Skiddaw Slates of vast thickness and complexity of structure.
2. Green Slates and Porphyry • • • in thickness, and (?) coming to 
an edge.
3. Old Red Conglomerate in patches, and not continuous.
4. Carboniferous Limestone.
5. New Red Sandstone.
So that we often have the Carboniferous Limestone lying immediately in the 
Skiddaw Slates, and on the N.W. side of Cumberland this is always the case.
How this can match with the formations on the N.
side of the Solvvay Firth is 
more than I can see at present.
I must conclude, for my friends are tired of waiting for me.
Accept my best 
wishes for your honour and success in your pursuits ; — my power of work is 
very nearly over.
But for this suppressed gout I should long since have told 
the pubhc all I wish to tell ; but I must conclude.
Very truly yours, 
A. SEDGWICK.
* I wish to direct special attention to this remark ; the italics are Sedgwick's.— J.G.G.
161 
Harkness's reply to this I have not seen, but its general nature 
may be gathered from the letter Sedgwick wrote a week or so 
later : — 
Dent, Kendal, September 12, 1856.
My dear Professor, 
I am very greatly obliged to you for your long and kind letter.
The 
information you have given me respecting the mineral axis [in the S.
of Scot- 
land.
J.G.G.] I cannot now turn to profit, for I have given up all hope of 
meeting Professor Rogers.
* * * I have not the least objection to your 
hypothesis respecting the Upper and Lower Skiddaw Slates if the sections will 
sanction it.
It is not at all necessary even to suppose that the granite breaks 
out through the lowest group of .Skiddaw Slates, though the remnant of my 
Wemerianism might have misled me 011 such a point when I examined the 
Skiddaw Slates, now more than thirty years since : and I have, unfortunately, 
never examined it since.
You say the/ossi/s of the so-called ;<//<?;- and lower Skiddaw Slates are the 
same.
But what are the fossils ?
If they are mere fucoids, I should not regard 
the similarity as of much consequence.
If the same shells, or the same grapto- 
lites occur both in the so-called upper as well as in the lower division of the 
Slates, then the fossil evidence would be of value.
That makes me anxious (as 
indeed I have been for years back) about the gritty beds in the great glens and 
ravines of Grassmoor.
In this Salter finds many fossils in the Stiper Stones 
and other hard gritty bands which overlie the Lower Longmynd Series.
The 
Rocks of Barrow Head very much resemble the Welsh group under the Lingida 
Flags.
Are you sure that the Balmae fossils are Wenlock ?
I doubt it still ; for my 
own small collection proves nothing for or against the supposition, and the 
section, so far as I understood it to be, would put these fossils into an old 
Cambrian group.
I should delight to meet you on the frontier chains of Scotland, but, alas !
old age is spoiling me.
I used to take great liberties, and cared little about 
charging any drift, as I had good sight and was a tough walker.
But noi.v I am 
a gouty old man, and can endure no wet.
My sight is bad, and one eye is of no 
use to me, and my walking days are nearly over.
So I should be a downright 
drag upon an active young man like you.
* * It is quite possible that Mc. Coy's 
List might be called Lockerby, and be so published in the "Athenasum." But 
I am about certain that in the abstract of my paper published in the Reports of 
the British Association, the graptolites were called the fossils of the Moffat 
Group.
Pray look at the abstract if you possess the Report of the Edinburgh Meeting 
of the British Association.
I am called out, and must conclude.
I am truly and gratefully yours,

These letters shew plainly the turn Harkness's attention was 
taking at the time.
Great numbers of the beautiful specimens of 
graptolites now preserved in the Carlisle Museum he had found in 
some dark anthracitic slates and schists in the older Palaeozoic 
rocks of the South of Scotland.
Looking across the Solway to 
our own fells, he must often have asked himself the question 
whether long-continued and diligent search amongst the rocks 
that compose those fells might not be rewarded by like results.
That his sagacity was not at fault is abundantly evident by the 
collection that he thereafter began to gather together.
The first published results of his researches in the new field I 
have yet been able to find any notice of is that read before the 
British Association in 1857, on the Geology of the Caldbeck Fells 
and the Lowest Sedimentary Rocks of Cumberland.
This part of 
our district thenceforward possessed for him a high degree of 
interest, and it is probable that, with the exception of the late Mr.
J. Clifton Ward, no man ever possessed so complete a knowledge 
of the structural details of this intensely-interesting part of tlie 
Lake District as did Harkness himself.
To say nothing of the 
geological work he did in connection with it, there is the remarkably- 
fine series of minerals he collected from that part to bear witness 
to his indefatigable industry and research over the wild moorlands 
of that elevated tract.
We still continue to find records of his going to and fro from 
various parts of Ireland, turning his attention now to one, then to 
another branch of geological enquiry, and, as difficulties arose, of 
his going off to other parts of the kingdom in search of facts that 
would serve to elucidate these points.
He visited Cumberland 
and Westmorland with increasing frequency about this time, and 
then, as he encountered any of the numerous difficulties they pre- 
sented, we find him, in like manner, going far afield with the same 
object in view.
It was about this time that he seems first to have recognized the 
full extent of that famous unconformity we can boast of in Edenside 
between the Lower members of the Palaeozoic Series and the 
Upper, or Carboniferous.
Realising that the removal by denuda- 
163 
tion of a pile of rock, equal in thickness to nearly ^ve miles, in the 
interval between the close of one formation and the commencement 
of the next members of the geological series we have any local 
record of — realising that there is nearly five miles of rock missing 
between the Silurian rocks of the Lake District and the Carbon- 
iferous rocks that now skirt their flanks — Harkness's keen spirit of 
scientific enquiry led him to explore other parts of the kingdom, 
where some representatives of the enormous lapse of time implied 
by this "grand unconformity were wholly, or in part, to be found.
So we find him setting out for the region that Hugh Miller has 
rendered classical by the publication of his book on the Old Red 
Sandstone.
But before setting out, besides mastering the literature 
of the subject, which had then already extended to a considerable 
length, he is communicating his intention to his fellow geologists, 
and otherwise preparing himself for making the best possible use 
of the limited time he was able to devote to the work.
The 
following letter from Sir Charles Lyell well illustrates the nature 
of the relations subsisting between these two well-known men of 
science.
S3, Harley Street, July 5, 1861.
Dear Harkness, 
I am glad you can go to Forfarshire.
I enclose a copy of my section* 
with the alterations proposed to be made in the woodcut in accordance with 
your former suggestions.
These changes can be made in type by putting in 
writing and a few lines to make the clay slate dip N.W.
As to the great anticlinal of the Sidlaw I am well aware of minor inequalities 
and the intrusion of trap, and perhaps there may be several faults in the line I 
have chosen, but you will find the dips correct in the main, as I have given 
them.
Indeed, Mr. Powrie says they are so.
My object was to simplify to the 
student.
But if the beds {a) are conformable, I must modify the section.
Perhaps you 
will be able to suggest how, without disturbing my page, to get over the 
difficulty.
But I will not alter it unless you say that the case of conformability is 
quite clear.
I shall be surprised if there is not an overlapping series.
All may 
be Old Red, but («) may have been formed after the beds 3 and 2 were slightly 
raised and denuded.
If I understand Mr. Powrie, he thinks that the conglomerate and sandstone 
* The section illustrating the physical relations of the Upper Old Red to the Lower, 
inserted in the "Student's Manual." 
164 
(a) agree with the Red Head Beds which I thought as old, if not rather older, 
than the Auchmithie conglomerate.
You will observe that for my object in introducing the diagram section the 
unconformable beds {a) were not wanted at all, so it will be unlucky if I was 
mistaken.
Look for pebbles and boulders of rolled conglomerate in the Whiteness beds.
I cannot find my notes, but I think I saw them and was much struck with them 
thirty-five or more years ago.
What you say of the Corncockle Muir footprints being, as we supposed, 
Permian, is most satisfactory.
Let me hear as soon as you have been at Whiteness.
I am very glad you 
were so far north as to be able to go there.
Believe me, very truly yours, 
CHAS.
LYELL.
P.S.
— On my old map I see I had marked some strata at Denhead with the 
same colour as the Whiteness beds ; but I forget all about this.
You will see 
as you go along the coast.
I enclose a copy of part of my map.
The dips, 
however, are put in now merely to shew why I thought the Whiteness beds 
newer than the Auchmithie and Red Head beds.
The second letter, equally characteristic of the writer, is from 
Murchison in relation to the same subject.
28 Jermyn Street, July 8, i86i.
My dear Harkness, 
I am right glad you are going to examine the Scarabein (rough 
mountain) composed of the white quartz-rock forming the east of Sutherland 
and south of Caithness.
Three times have I examined these rocks.
jst, in 1827, with Sedgwick, with a view to their relation to the Old Red 
Conglomerate base, which, on their flanks is a white conglomerate (see Trans.
Geo/.
Soc, 2nd sen, vol.
xi., p.
351.
2ftd, With Nicol in 1854.
^rd, By myself in 1858, when I staid with the Speaker [Denison] at Langwell 
on the Berridale Ness, and 
Lastly, When I took Ramsay with me in 1859, we traversed direct from the 
west coast, and traced the succession of gneissose strata all along the north 
coast which are so broken and turned up by intense pressure of granite in its 
eastern extremity, that nothing is more probable (and 1 have for some time 
thought so) that a trough might be established.
As, however, the weather was very rough and wet as we came along the 
island road from coast at Melvid and Big House to the inn of Achintoul, and 
thence by Kildonan to Helmsdale (a charming geological road), that independ- 
165 
ently of examining the two great Old Red outliers of the Ben Gream, we merely 
looked at the rocks in our wa}', which were chiefly granite, with that gneiss 
which we consider as newer gneiss.
But we ought to have halted for some days at the very comfortable isolated 
iim of Achintoul, whence we should have pushed forward and entered to the 
sources of the Berriedale series and the western flanks of the "Scarabein." 
I have gone along their immediate western flanks and found highly inclined 
gneiss and granite, and the same extend southward and west of there towards 
Kildonan.
All, however, seemed so broken and chaotic that I could not venture to 
identify the quartz rock of the Scarabein with that of the West coast.
For what so likely as to have another band of altered sandstone higher in the 
series ?
If, on the other hand, it be possible through your labours, to determine the 
existence of a trough — then I believe that the quartz rocks near Portsoy on the 
East coast of Aberdeen, with the limestones and serpentines, will fit into the 
same category.
I rejoice at the prospect of your clearing up this most im- 
portant point.
But I must entreat you not to do it in a mere skirmish.
Abandon eveiything else for this fundamental question, and if you do go to 
Achintoul, pray walk not by the high road, but mountaineer along the great 
granitoid band to the N.N.E. of the Achintoul iim, which separates Caithness 
from Sutherland.
No one has done this.
Nor has any geologist examined the inland tract between Strathnane and 
Strath Helladale.
To do that you must live a night or two with the shepherds, but it would, 
/ am sure, well repay you ; and you may there find great undulations and even 
reversions of the strata.
If you decide on such a campaign I will again send you the Duke's map of 
Sutherland, and any notes of mine bearing on the Scarabein.
The latter 
mountains are best examined in detail from the inn at Berriedale on their 
eastern slope.
I thought I detected the most obvious proofs of the gradual metamorphism of 
sandstones, flagstones, and schists, little altered in the east, into the very pure 
quartz rock of these mountains at their summits.
The Rev. Mr.
Joass, of Edderton, Ross (W.
of Tain), has discovered a fine 
preserve of the Caithness fish in his parish.
They are all promised to me.
If you go there you will see how closely the yellow sandstone of Port 
Mahannah and Tarbet Ness overlie these fish deposits.
Yours sincerely, 
R. I.
MURCHISON.
16rt 
P.S.
— I am also rejoiced that you are bringing out a grand British equivalent 
of the Rotheliegende of my Permian.
You are my best supporter.
I am to 
preside over the geologists at Manchester, and should be proud to have your 
communication there, though I hope you will not personally abandon good 
field work in fine weather.
Why do you talk to me of Nicol and his map ?
Why, he never heard of 
the Scarabein till I took him there.
I have dwelt upon it in various memoirs, 
and united them in my map of the Highlands ; classing them, however, with 
the Upper Gneiss.
Near the end of each letter is a comment upon some work that 
Harkness was doing in another direction.
The full importance of 
the remarks referred to will be noticed further on.
On his return from these expeditions Harkness was not long in 
putting his impressions on paper ; not that they were likely to fade 
soon from his memory, but because he had, or seems to me to 
have had, an unaccountable habit of recording his observations 
only in the form they are now accessible to us.
His note books 
do, it is true, contain a few highly-condensed and pithy remarks, 
and they contain also the sketches, and other data absolutely 
necessary for the object he had in view; but beyond that they 
present us with little else than a scanty series of memoranda : for 
the rest he seems ever to have trusted to his unquestionably very 
powerful memory.
Amongst the further correspondence relating to this part of his 
work, placed at my disposal by Mrs. Pearson, the following 
additional letter from Sir Charles Lyell may be cited : — 
53 Harley Street, i6th October, 1861.
I have read your letter on the Old Red of Perthshire with much interest, 
and have only put it and the section aside for the present because I have to 
supply the printer with M.S. on the Tertiary Strata, but shall return to the 
Cephalaspis and Pteraspis beds as soon as I can.
You will, I hope, be giving 
us a paper soon on the subject.
I got Professor Heer two days ago to go over all your specimens, and was 
afraid when I saw the quantity of things I had to do, that he would not be 
able to do justice to them.
But he looked at each, and said no one could 
pronounce on them generically or specifically, but that they were Conifers — the 
wood and leaves, and in one case at least remains of a cone of some genus of 
Coniferae.
This, he says, tells nothing geologically.
It seems, however, to 
167 
me that ii is good so far if the beds be primary or Palaeozoic, for the absence of 
any such cones in the coal strata has made botanists suspect that the Conifers 
of that age were like the Yew Tree, and, like a great majority of the Coniferje 
of the southern hemisphere, berry-bearing, not cone-bearing.
To find a cone therefore, is something I never did in coal or older beds.
The 
same quarries might in time yield good things.
Believe me, very truly yours, 
CHAS.
LYELL.
The results of these expeditions in search of the missing members 
of the Palseozoic rocks were communicated in the form of three, 
or more, papers, which appeared in 1862.
Some of the views 
therein expressed were mainly in accordance with Murchison's, and 
were at variance with views that the researches of some other 
investigators were just then bringing into prominence.
That 
Harkness should evince a preference for the older views is not 
surprising when we reflect upon the extent of the influence the 
writings of Murchison had exerted upon the current of geological 
thought at that time.
But that some of these views were beginning 
to be called in question — and they are views on matters intimately 
connected with the geological structure of our own district — is 
sufficiently manifested by the following extract from a letter by 
Professor Jukes, at that time at the head of the Geological Survey 
of Ireland.
Jukes too, is lost to the geological world now.
Had 
he been willing to sacrifice his zeal for the advancement of science 
in the interests of his own peace of mind, he might have lived to 
induced geologists to thoroughly re-examine the evidence regarding 
many other questions supposed to have been long since authori- 
tatively settled.
The whole history of the "Devonian question" 
is well worth attentive study, apart from its bearings upon local 
geology.
Jukes is dead, but we have his opinions left.
The 
contest he waged in defence of what he believed to be the truth is 
being carried on yet.
How it will ultimately terminate remains 
to be seen.
Ruthin, Denbighshire, December 21, 1862.
My dear Harkness, 
* * You don't quite imderstand what I meant about Old Red — I 
mean that all Old Red, whether at Ledbury or elsewhere, that contains any 
168 
species of Cephalaspis, or Pteraspis, belongs of right to the Silurian system, 
and will have to be detached from the true Old Red. What you say and what 
Geikie says of the break between the Upper and Lower Old Red (so called) of 
Scotland, is an argument in favour of this idea, that Lower Old Red is a 
Silurian sub-group.
I think it very likely that two or three formations (systems, 
or series, some perhaps not known anywhere yet) are represented in our country 
by that jumble of red sandstones, conglomerates, etc., etc., which have been 
hitherto confounded as Old Red. I believe the Lower Old Red to be upper- 
most Silurian, and the uppermost Old Red to be lowermost Carboniferous.
Whether anything that might be called Devonian will come anywhere between 
them is an unsolved problem.
But neither the Lower Old Red nor the upper- 
most Old Red are entitled to be called Devonian, unless by Devonian you 
mean a sub-group of the Carboniferous.
I still doubt your fault, and your supposition of trap coming up it makes me 
doubt it more.
I have heard of such cases, but I never saw one, and doubt 
the intrusion of igneous rock being ever connected with disturbance.
That, however, is mere doubt ; but I am sure it only misleads to class under 
one name two groups which are unconformable to each other.
I tell you this in order that you may keep your eyes open and not commit 
yourself too far in favour of old notions that will shortly be consigned to Limbo, 
Mrs. Jukes unites in kind regards to yourself and your sister.
Yours very truly, 
J. BEETE JUKES.
Then follows a paper that I had occasion just now incidentally 
to allude to.
For some time past Harkness had been going again 
and again over the ground described by Sedgwick in his well-known 
paper on the New Red of these parts.
With the rapid advance 
that was then being made in the geology of the older rocks — an 
advance that was due very largely to Murchison's orderly conspectus 
of the facts collected by every worker at the subject, Harkness 
himself amongst others — it was hardly possible for Harkness not 
to be fully aware that a very great deal yet remained to be worked 
out before the sequence of the Edenside Red Rocks could be 
reduced to anything like a definite system or order.
And this was 
the task he next addressed himself to.
To us now-a-days, the real 
difficulty of this undertaking can hardly be fully estimated, unless 
it be by anyone that would undertake to begin the work with the 
same amount of information to start with that he had.
It must be 
borne in mind, if we would be just in our appreciation of the true 
169 
merits of such a piece of work as this, that there was, up to that 
time, very few records of the position of the parts of the district 
where the best natural exposures were laid bare.
It was therefore 
necessary to make a series of traverses in every likely direction and 
to carefully record all the facts disclosed by those sections.
This 
alone entailed a great deal of bodily labour, not to be got through 
in the course of a few days or a few weeks, as would suffice for the 
examination of such sections when their localities are already placed 
on record.
Then there was the by-no-means easy task of collating 
the various sections and noting their points of agreement and of 
difference.
Then arose questions regarding the relations of these 
rocks to rocks of similar age in other parts of England, or of 
Europe, all involving a considerable amount of research, com- 
parison of sections, collecting and examining fossils, and work of 
that kind.
The results of these observations were recorded on a 
large map (nothing like so good a map topographically as are 
within the reach of all of us now).
This map, still in the possession 
of Mrs. Pearson, is one that I have ever regarded with a peculiar 
interest, because it is undoubtedly the earliest essay at making a large 
scale geological map of our district that had yet been attempted.
Moreover, my own official duties have led me to map, in even a 
more highly-detailed manner, a large part of the area represented 
by that map ; and although here and there I have been led to put 
a slightly-different construction upon some of the facts he has 
recorded, I can bear the fullest testimony to its accuracy as a 
whole.
The results of his observations were summed up in a 
paper published in Vol. xviii.
of the Quart.
Journ.
of the Geological 
Society.
Thenceforward there was little else of the Geology of the 
Red Rocks of Edenside left to work out than the minor details of 
structure, and some few points of a more or less theoretical 
character.
The next year appeared a paper on the Skiddaw Slate series, 
which was accompanied by some notes on the fossils by Mr.
Salter.
Like the paper last referred to, this formed an important 
contribution to the literature of a group of rocks whose exact 
geological position has always presented great difficulties to the 
170 
student of British Palaeozoic Geology.
Harkness, by diligent 
search, had succeeded in detecting a few fossils in these rocks, 
which, for a long time had been regarded as entirely destitute of 
traces of life of any kind.
The very fossils referred to and figured 
in the paper are now preserved along with the rest of his collection 
in the Carlisle Museum.
Another paper on a kindred subject followed shortly after; and 
then came a paper that has always seemed to me one of the most 
important of his contributions to the Geological history of Edenside : 
that on the isolated strip of older pateozoic rocks associated with 
the great Pennine Faults between Warcop and Gamblesby.
As 
the mapping of the whole of that group of rocks was entrusted 
officially to my care, I may fairly claim to be in a better position 
to judge of the merits of the paper referred to than any person at 
present living ; and it gives me very great pleasure to testify to the 
great advance it marks beyond any of the contributions of previous 
writers.
Here and there the Geological Survey has been led to 
differ from the author in matters of minor detail ; but in the main, 
the points of agreement are so numerous as to form matter for 
surprise to every one that realises the full extent of the difficulties 
that Harkness dealt with and overcame single-handed so many 
years ago.
In the second part of this paper I have endeavoured 
to give an abstract of the general conclusions he arrived at, which 
will enable the student to judge for himself how great an advance 
upon our previous knowledge of these rocks this paper of Hark- 
ness's really marks.
In 1864 Harkness made an attempt at working out the position 
of some rocks in the North East of Scotland that had yielded 
footprints, and other vestiges of animal life, similar in their nature 
to what had previously engaged his attention in Dumfries.
The 
very problematical nature of these remains from our New Red, 
which, as I have before taken occasion to remark, are the sole 
vestiges of the air-breathing animals of that period, stimulated him 
to undertake further researches in the same direction ; and as it 
was about this time that he had made the discovery of some foot- 
prints, probably reptilian in character, in the Penrith Sandstone of 
171 
Brownrigfi; near Penrith, he was anxious to see whether any further 
light could be thrown upon their true nature by observations made 
upon similar rocks in other parts.
In the case of the subject of 
the paper now referred to there was — perhaps I might almost 
venture to say that in some minds there is still — some doubt as to 
the precise position of these beds in the North of Scotland, 
whether they were the equivalents in time of the true Old Red, or 
whether they did not represent the equivalents of some of these 
Red Rocks that form the surface rock of so large a portion of 
Edenside.
The conclusions he arrived at were embodied in a 
communication to the Geological Society in November, 1864.
Some time after Harkness had written the papers on the New 
Red rocks of the Basin of the Solway that have already been 
referred to.
Sir Roderick Murchison decided to pay that part of 
the kingdom a visit, with a view to making a personal examination 
of the various sections already described.
Accordingly in the * • 
of 1865, Harkness went with him to each of the principal localities 
described, and explained his views to Sir Roderick on the spot.
We have evidence that one result of this joint expedition was that 
Harkness was induced to make some important modifications in 
the scheme of classification that his previous independent investi- 
gations had led him to accept.
The question at issue was, where 
the line dividing the Secondary Rocks from the Palaeozoic should 
be drawn.
Many observers had been hard at work with this same 
object in view for years past ; but, as I shall have occasion to 
remark presently, some of these geologists had collected fossils 
from Carboniferous rocks stained red — like the sandstones that 
emerge from beneath our New Red all over Edenside — and, 
because these rocks were similar in colour to the New Red itself, 
they were regarded as of the same age.
Then, when it was 
observed that the fossils got from these supposed New Red rocks 
were wonderfully like the fossils from the Carboniferous series 
while it was known that the fossils from the higher parts of the 
New Red — the equivalents in time of some of the rocks around 
Carlisle — had closer affinities with the so-called Secondary Rocks, 
it became evident that, if the character of included fossils was to 
172 
be taken as any test of the age of the rocks wherein they occur, 
the upper part of this New Red series would have to be joined on 
to the Secondary Rocks, which we now know to be their correct 
position; while the lower part would have to be, somehow or 
other, joined on to the Palaeozoic series.
Consequently the line 
marking off the one great division from the other would have to be 
taken somewhere or other through the middle of the New Red.
This is the position generally assigned to it even yet, though there 
are not wanting signs that this view does not give general satis- 
faction to such geologists as insist upon weighing all the evidence 
with a view to forming their own independent conclusions.
Sir 
Roderick's views were put forward in the introductory portion of 
the memoir that appeared under their joint authorship in the 
Quarterly Journal of the Geological Societ)'^ in 1865, which memoir 
was the last that Harkness wrote on the stratigraphical relations 
of the New Red, there, or elsewhere.
Harkness was hard at work at the same time upon the older 
Palaeozoic rocks, and was joined in many of his expeditions by 
the well-known palaeontologist, Dr. H.
A. Nicholson of Penrith, 
now Professor of Natural History at Aberdeen.
Amongst the many 
new facts their joint researches brought to light were some that we 
find Harkness still discussing with the veteran geologist.
Professor 
Sedgwick — one of whose last letters, lying before me as I write 
this, is almost illegible through the trembling of the writer's hand.
It will be seen by this that, although Harkness was not actually 
writing anything about the New Red with a view to publication, 
he was still manifesting as much interest in the subject as ever.
The same letter also shews plainly enough in what other directions 
Harkness and his fellow-worker.
Dr. Nicholson, had been working 
of late.
Cambridge, February 16, 1865.
My dear Professor Harkness, 
I must be very short if I am to obey my doctor's orders, and I know 
and feel that it is my duty to do so.
I never received your former letter respecting the Westmorland fossils under 
the base of the Coniston Limestone.
I was * * during the summer — my 
health was bad.
In August and September I was at * * Early in October 
173 
I was for a short time in Gloucester * * and saw I think, Salter, * * 
told me the news.
I cannot be surprised at the news * * It was not to * * that the great 
group, but was the Skiddaw Slate, and the Coniston Limestone must somewhere 
contain fossils.
* * * almost the last time I was among the Tiake moun- 
tains I found, about one or two hundred feet under the Coniston group at the 
S.W. end of Cumberland, some traces of fossils, evidently common Coniston 
forms, but very imperfect ; perhaps I overrated the thickness of the beds under 
the limestone band.
At that spot the Coniston Limestone is much altered, and 
the beds both above it and below it are of the green colour of the great lower 
group, which I think led Sharpe to doubt if it was Coniston Limestone ; that 
if it was Coniston Limestone * * easy to say that this was the case generally 
that it was anything more than a slight expansion of the calcareous slates of the 
Coniston group.
I am told that your fossils^ are far deeper seated in the Green 
Slate series.
* * person told me * * about twenty years since.
If I 
mistake, not Charles Wright of Keswick was my informant that Murton Pike 
was Skiddaw Slate.
Are you are aware that Buckland and Greenhough gave a 
description of the porphyritic pikes?
(see an old vol.
of the Geol.
Trans., 4to.
)^ 
But they knew nothing of the fossils or of the Old Slate group.
Your section is most interesting.
The fault you have drawn is on a magnifi- 
cent scale, especially interesting * * * Fossils.
I shall be thankful for any 
good specimens you can send for our museum.
I never had a private collection, 
I shunned the temptation of making one.
Again, the discovery of the fish beds of the Magnesian Limestone is an 
excellent hit.
I have maps here, but must not fatigue myself by consulting 
them J so I cannot refer to any locality.
In 1834 I traced the boundary of the 
hard sandstone^ from Temple Sowerby to Brough along with a friend.
We 
saw, at a distance, the group of your grand section, but they were not our 
object.
In this area of the New Red Sandstone (down the vale of the Eden to 
the Solway) we there have, from your description (i) the Marl Fish Slate and 
other shales of the Magnesian Limestone group ; (2) the 'flaggy red beds of the 
Bunter Sandstein * ; (3) Gypseous Marls ^ ; (4) Lias.
Nos. 3 and 4 I have 
never seen, but there they are.
And how are we to draw the line to cut off 
the beds that are palteozoic ?
1 proved many a long year since that the fossils of the Magnesian Limestone 
group were essentially palaeozoic.
But physically the group seemed part of the 
New Red. So the matter stood.
I suggested no change of correlation.
So a 
year afterwards Phillips proposed (at the Geological Society) that we should

cut the group off from the Trias — as it was palaeozoic.
I assented at once, for 
it was plain that we could not move on without making fossils the grand tests 
of our group.
Murchison objected!
(he was the only one that stood out) and he 
continued his objections, arguing that Reptiles were secondary groups.
I wish 
Phillips had given us a name for the group- he had a right to do so, and as his 
uncle ("Father" Smith,) had called the lowest bed Pontefract Castle Kock, I 
suggested the name Pontefract Group.
But I have tired myself, and you also 
I fear — so I must conclude with best thanks and congratulations.
My working 
days are done.
I am within a few weeks (about five) of completing my eightieth 
year, and since I came back (near the beginning of last week) after careful 
exatnhiation I am proved to have an organic heart disease which will be my 
companion through the coming remnant of my life.
I have thoroughly disobeyed 
my doctor's orders, and much tired myself.
So, adieu.
I am, faithfully yours, 
A. SEDGWICK.
From certain evidence we have, it would appear that the 
relations between the Professors at the Queen's Colleges in Ireland 
and the governing bodies were not altogether satisfactory in every 
respect.
This may have been due to several causes that neither 
the teaching- nor the administrative body were themselves answer- 
able for.
Things were not altogether as pleasant for Harkness as 
he could have wished, which is hardly to be wondered at when it 
becomes known that — whether it was from motives of economy, or 
from motives of other kinds, does not seem clear — the Professor of 
Geology was asked to teach not only his own subjects — Geology 
and Mineralogy — but Physical Geography, Botany, and Zoology 
as well.
Harkness was perfectly competent to discharge these 
multifarious duties as well as could be expected of any one man ; 
but he must have been fully aware that to teach every one of these 
subjects in the way he would prefer to see them taught, would 
involve mental strain such as only a man in the full possession of 
health and vigour could safely undertake for any length of time.
Naturally enough Harkness wished to find himself in a position 
where he would be required to teach only what he could teach 
best, and where he should be allowed to teach that according to a 
method of his own choosing.
It is not, therefore, surprising that 
when there appeared to be some prospect of a Chair of Geology 
175 
being founded at Edinburgh, separate from the Chair of Natural 
History, Harkness should be looking forward to the time when he 
might offer himself as a candidate for that post.
I have been 
given to understand that he did so with more confidence in the 
result in consequence of the tenour of certain remarks made by 
Sir Roderick Murchison, whence Harkness seems to have gathered 
the impression that in the event of the Chair been founded and of 
Harkness's coming forward as a candidate, he might rely upon Sir 
Roderick's support.
It appears that there was a mistake some- 
where, as the following letter from Sir Charles Lyell will shew : — 
S3 Harley Street, January 30, 1866.
Dear Harkness, 
I should have written to you before, had I not waited to hear what 
the Chancellor of the Exchequer would say when Sir R.
I. Murchison met 
him [in regard to the question] whether we were to have an Edinburgh 
Professorship or not * * 
I am disappointed to learn that [Gladstone] says the Eoyal Commission 
settled all that some six years ago, and if he were to break this in the case 
of Edinburgh, all the other Universities would be coming upon them for 
endowments.
But perhaps I shall still go up with a deputation to Lord Russell.
Sir E.
will not, I think, give it up ; but I cannot say that I feel very sanguine, 
whereas I had really reckoned upon the Chair as a certainty, and had 
imagined that the Commission had recommended — as you seem also to have 
supposed — its institution.
But I fear it was not so.
My late father-in-law, Mr. Horner, was always recommending Geikie to 
aspire to this Chair, and I feel myself in some measure committed to advocate 
his cause, having been accustomed to look forward to his being a candidate 
long before I entertained any idea of your becoming one.
But I shall, of 
course, be always ready to give my testimony in favour of your qualifications, 
and am truly sorry to hear that so retrograde a step is contemplated as the 
uniting of Botany and Geology.
Truly, Sir E.
Peel's untimely death was a 
great loss.
I do not wonder you wish to escape from a country where they 
wish to make all education denominational * * 
Believe me, dear Harkness, 
Ever truly yours, 
CHAS.
LYELL.
However, Harkness did not allow a temporary disappointment 
to abate his ardour in the least, and durins; the next few months 
17G 
we find that he had been as hard at work at his favourite subject 
as ever.
One of his memoirs treats of the Geology of the Isle of 
Man, which he was wont to regard as a kind of geographical link 
between the Geology of Ireland and that of Cumberland and 
Westmorland.
There is another on the Dingle Promontory in 
Ireland, one on the Graptolites of the Llandovery Rocks of 
Haverfordwest.
But it was about this time — that is to say, from 
1864 onward — that he had associated with his name in the 
preparation of several of his memoirs, that of his friend Mr. H.
A. 
Nicholson of Penrith, now the well-known author of some of our 
best text-books on Zoological and Palaeontological subjects, and 
Professor of Natural History at the University of Aberdeen.
Nicholson had worked over a large area of Cumberland and 
Westmorland along with Harkness some time before, and by the 
year 1870 they had published four several memoirs under their 
joint authorship, each paper having important bearings upon the 
the geology of the older rocks of this part.
It was in the autumn of 1867 that I had the first opportunity of 
making the personal acquaintance of the subject of the present 
sketch.
This was at Penrith, where Professor Ramsay, Mr.
Hughes (whose extensive acquaintance with the Geology of West- 
morland enabled him to largely make use of our local illustrations 
when he afterwards succeeded Professor Sedgwick at Cambridge), 
and others, had met to discuss certain questions connected with 
the Geology of this part, where we had, only a few months before, 
just commenced the Geological Survey.
Harkness, as a writer, 
was well-known to me long before, and I naturally felt a consider- 
able degree of interest in making his closer aquaintance.
Two or 
three hours may seem absurdly inadequate to enable one to form 
any judgment regarding the disposition of a man that one has 
never set eyes upon before.
But it happened that early in the 
course of our meeting, some questions arose regarding certain 
points in the geology of this neighbourhood wherein the conclusions 
that some of the party had arrived at differed considerably from 
what Harkness had previously expressed in some of his papers.
m 
Considering that we had just begun to go over the ground that 
Harkness had been hammering at for many years past, it would 
have been nothing to wonder at if Harkness had betrayed more or 
less symptoms of annoyance.
For if you want to see what a man 
is made of, try him in like manner, and watch the result.
Ten to 
one, if you are controverting a statement he has allowed to get 
into print, the inner side of that man's nature will be brought to 
view at once, and the chances are that he will fall in your estima- 
tion.
It is only occasionally that one meets with a man whose 
qualities of heart are as genuine as those of his mind, and who can 
bear being put to a test of this kind without sinking in the esteem 
of anyone.
That was one of Harkness's most marked peculiarities : 
it came out very strongly on the occasion I refer to.
I may add 
that on the many occasions after that time when I have myself 
expressed opinions different from what he had been led to adopt 
from a previous and independent study of the same facts, I ever 
found him ready to discuss the subject considerately and with 
perfect good temper where other men would have found much 
difficulty in listening at all.
It was this genial and tolerant dispo- 
sition — whereof his features themselves were a sufificient index — 
that combined with his scientific attainments to make him so 
popular in every assembly of scientific men wherever he might 
chance to be.
At the time I first met Harkness he was engaged, amongst 
other enquiries, in collecting evidence regarding the distribution 
of Boulders of Shap Granite ; a subject that has formed a standing 
puzzle to geologists for now well on to fifty years, and, so many 
think, is as far off being explained, at any rate, to their satisfaction, 
as ever.
The results of this enquiry he embodied in a paper that 
was printed in 1870 : I shall refer to this again.
But another enquiry, and one of very considerable practical 
importance, was just beginning to occupy the attention of a large 
section of the scientific world about this time.
I refer to the 
Government Coal-Commission.
Everybody whose memory extends 
back fifteen or twenty years must remember the general tone of 
alarm running through nearly every public communication that 
12 
178 
had any reference to the future welfare of England in connection 
with the possible early exhaustion of that one of the chief sources 
of our national wealth.
They will remember, too, how the opinion 
of most of the leading scientific men of the day was sought, and 
placed on record, regarding the probable extent of coal-fields 
available as sources of supply in the future.
One of the areas 
where it had often been considered probable that the existence of 
Coal Measures might hereafter be detected, was that of the tract of 
older rocks concealed beneath the New Red of Cumberland and 
Westmorland.
Harkness, being recognized as possessing a more 
extensive and intimate acquaintance with the general geology of 
these parts than anyone else could then fairly lay claim to, was 
requested to give his opinion upon that important question.
This 
he did in 1867, and his evidence duly apppeared in the Report of 
the Royal Coal Commission, published a year or so afterwards.
Among the men of science Harkness's researches amongst the 
older Palaeozoic rocks had made him acquainted with, was Mr.
Thomas Davidson, F.R.S., the eminent authority on fossil Brachio- 
poda.
Davidson, after a long career of scientific labours, whose 
value it is impossible to over-estimate, is still amongst us yet ; and 
it may be of interest to give here an extract from one of several 
letters that passed between him and Harkness.
A great number 
of the Brachiopoda from Cumberland and Westmorland now in 
the geological collection at the Carlisle Museum were determined 
by Dr. Davidson ; but there is in the letter subjoined some 
references of importance in regard to subjects that are now (1883) 
just beginning to attract renewed attention ; subjects that at the 
time the letter was written were only just being brought promi- 
nently before men's minds.
My dear Sir, 
* * It has been exceedingly kind of you to have afforded me so 
much valuable and needed information * * On Friday last I went to 
St. Leonards-on-Sea to spend the day with my old and valued friends Sir 
Roderick and Lady Murchison, also with Dr. Bowerbank.
I was three 
hours with Sir Roderick, and had a very long chat on Silurian and Survey 
matters.
Sir Roderick was so pleased to see me, and we sat most of the 
time together (except at luncheon) in his bedroom, as Lady Murchiaon felt 
179 
so unwell.
Sir E.
presented me with the prize Survey Silurian Medal, and 
had written in the inside of the box containing it : "To my valued friend 
Thomas Davidson, in memoriam of his admirable illustrations and History 
of Silurian Life, Sept.
25, 1868.
(Signed) Rod. I.
Murchison." It is a 
beautiful medal, and the likeness of Sir Roderick on one side is admirable.
* * We have been intimately acquainted for more than thirty years, 
and all along be has shewn me the greatest kindness and desire to see me 
rise in the esteem of geologists and men of science.
He also spoke in the most flattering terms of your valuable researches.
* * I told him how kindly you had assisted me, which seemed to please 
him.
He told me also that he had expressed a desire that every possible 
assistance should be afforded me by the Survey, as he considered my larger 
work as one of very great importance to the Survey.
In a letter I have just received he again says * * " Harkness has done 
much good in elaborating the order and contents of these older rocks." 
I had a long conversation with Sir Roderick with reference to Hicks* 
proposal to remove the Lower Lingula Flags (Menevian) from his primordial 
Silurian, and to add them on to Sedgwick's Lower Cambrian, or Harlech 
Beds.
But Sir R.
considers (like Barrande and De Verueuil) this his Lower 
Lingula Flags constitute the base of his lowest Silurian or Primordial 
Silurian, and that if the Harlech Group, or Upper Longmynd, is found to 
contain the same forms as his Lower Lingula Flags, this would shew that 
this Primordial Silurian should be carried a little lower down.
I confess to 
you that I have never thought that there existed two Natural History 
Systems, viz., a Cambrian one and a Silurian.
In my ideas the whole 
of the strata from the Harlech group up to the uppermost Ludlow 
would form one great system, by whatever name you may choose to 
call it — Cambrian or Silurian.
However, if Hicks can shew good 
cause why there should be two Natural History Systems in that series 
of Older Palaeozoic rocks, I shall be glad to recognize the matter ; but such 
can be done only after Mr. Hicks shall have figured and described the 
Harlech and Menevian fossils.
When in Paris I am going to have a long 
chat with M.
De Verneuil upon this and several other impoi-tant matters, 
some of which Sir Roderick wishes me to carefully investigate.
I find that 
•generally speaking foreign geologists are not more convinced than I am 
myself of the validity of the Cambrian and Silurian Natural History 
Systems.
We all know that a certain number of genera in every large 
system of rocks are restricted to certain portions of this system.
Hicks's researches and discoveries are of the greatest value and import- 
ance, and no small praise is due to him for the very able and persevering 
manner In which he has worked.
I shall therefore look forward with the 
greatest impatience to the publication of his valuable paper upon those very 
180 
ancient animals.
I have urged him in the strongest manner to publisli this 
winter his new species.
I have to thank you likewise for your kindness in sending me the fragment 
of Obolus found by Dr. Otto Torrell in the old Swedish rocks.
Unfortun- 
ately it is but a fragment of a valve, and not complete enough for specific 
identification.
It has, however, interested me much, and should you have 
occasion to write to Dr. Torell again, would you kindly let him know that 
I should much desire to examine a good specimen of each species of the 
Braehiopoda found in those old Swedish Primordial rocks.
I have recently 
worked out for Dr. Volborth of St. Petersburg all the species and genera of 
Obolus, &c., found in the oldest Russian Primordial rocks, and it would be 
most interesting to see if those Swedish forms agree with those found in 
Russia and Great Britain.
* * * With very many thanks for all your 
kindness, 
I remain, yours truly, 
THOS.
DAVIDSON.
The next letter is from Sir Charles Lyell, and is of interest if 
only as shewing that though Harkness mainly confined his energy 
to the working out of questions of a purely geological nature, the 
bearing of collateral subjects on his favourite science were not by 
any means overlooked.
73 Harley Street, 25th November, 1868.
My dear Harkness, 
I have been intending every day to thank you for your letter, when 
another arrives alluding to the Spiranthes.
In the first place I am pleased 
to find that you are reading my book ; for although the sale is getting on 
remarkably well, considering the dangerous experiment made of increasing 
the size and cost, yet as it is only a new edition I cannot reasonably expect 
those who have read the former version to find out how much novelty there 
may be in this.
Accordingly I find, as a general rule, that the older geolo- 
gists are not aware that I have published anything new in these later times, 
and I often wonder who are my readers.
Seeing that Bentham in his "Handbook of the British Flora," 1858, 
mentioned Splranthes gemmipara as a solitary instance of a species limited 
to the British Isles, I relied upon his accuracy, for he says that Dr.
Lindley has shewn that the Irish plant had been erroneously referred to the 
North American Splranthes cernua, a plant which it closely resembles.
The question now is, whether your reference to Professor Reichenbach 
corrects Lindley and Bentham.
I shall consult the latter and Hooker.
And in the meantime I am much obliged to you for calling my attention to 
this subject, and shall be glad of any other criticisms.
181 
No-w that I have alluded to the sale of one of my books, I may mention 
to you in confidence, -nhile it is a publishers' secret, that Murray has sold 
all the copies he has on hand of the 6th Edition of the "Elements;" so that 
in a year it will be out of print ; and I mean to leave it out of print for 
another year, hoping, if I live, to give an improved version two years 
hence.
My difSculty is that I should like to enlarge it as well as to re-cast parts 
of it ; but I have received warnings from certain teachers of geology who 
would like to use my Elements as a text-book that the book is already too 
bulky, or at least too costly for the purses of their students, and that, how- 
ever much improved, it wiU sell less if I do not take care to keep down the 
cost.
As they are possibly right, and the first thing is to consider in books 
of this kind, far more than in treatises such as the " Principles," how to 
make them useful to great numbers of students, I should be very glad of 
any hints.
The public are, no doubt, of the opinion of the old woman at Boston, 
Massachusetts, whose eyes and purse were growing weaker, and who was 
purchasing a Bible, and said she wanted one with the largest print and the 
lowest price.
But perhaps something might be done by omissions, and I 
should be glad of any hints.
I look upon your discovery of marine fossil shells in the Drift S.
of Dublin at 
the height of 1200 feet above the sea as most important : I believe I have 
not yet told you so.
A good conchologist would do well to hunt up every 
fragment, and get us a good list of species ; and every additional foot of 
altitude to which they can be traced is no small gain now thab these theories 
about the rising and falling of the sea, instead of oscillations of the land, 
are mooted.
Believe me, dear Harkness, 
Ever truly yours, 
CHAS.
LYELL, 
In the year 1869, the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science met at Exeter, and Harkness, who had been a constant 
attendant at these annual meetings for many years past, was elected 
President of the Geological section, and chose for the subject of 
his Presidential Address that of the relation of the Devonian rocks, 
properly so-called, to the strata next to them in age.
In this 
address he may be said to have summarised the results of all his 
observations upon the great group of strata whose absence in 
Cumberland and Westmorland has given rise to the well-known 
182 
and oft-described unconformity between the Older and the Newer 
Palaeozoic rocks.
Harkness was evidently still much exercised in his mind regarding 
the great problem of how boulders of Brockram and of other rocks 
from the low ground of Edenside could have been lifted a thousand 
feet or more above the position of their parent rocks, and trans- 
ported across the great upland tract of Stainmoor out to the shores 
of the North Sea. Harkness, as I have before mentioned, had 
worked out the subject of the distribution of boulders of Shap 
Granite (which is usually found along with the boulders just 
mentioned) as being a rock more easily traced in the drift, and 
therefore one whose distribution might be expected to furnish an 
answer to the much-vexed question then under consideration.
Professor Phillips had grappled with the same difificulty some time 
before, and here is a letter from him to Harkness concerning it : — 
Oxford, 15th September, 1869.
My dear Harkness, 
I am entirely of your mind as to the late date of the "Erratic" 
group : i.e. late in the Drift period.
I think this is certain for all the North 
of England.
And also as to the earlier date of the valleys : I admit most 
of them as earlier than any pleistocene (and in this I include my preglacial) 
deposits.
In one of my very earliest papers on the Lake District (1827), I 
show those valleys to have been of Palaeozoic date which contain the local 
Old Red Conglomerate of Kirkby Lonsdale, Kendal, &c.
Goldsborough 
has been in my mind not seldom, for I found some years since that I had 
given its height wrong, or had mistaken the summit.
The hill which I 
ascended had, I am pretty sure, granite on the summit ; many blocks have 
been removed since my examination — now one-third of a century, or in some 
cases nearly half a century since.
I do not well remember auy blocks in the Greta drainage tiU you descend 
towards Barnard Castle.
Then you have them about Lartington rather 
frequently, but that is not exactly in Greta drainage.
The stream of blocks 
widens in this part and goes to Darlington, Thirsk, Scarborough, &c.
I have seen blocks at Langwathby and beyond (not the Magic Stones), 
and on the line from Carnforth, Lancaster, &c.
But in Cheshire the blocks 
are from Eavenglass mostly.
* * 
Ever yeurs truly, 
J. PHILLIPS.
183 
The other problem alluded to as engaging Harkness's attention 
about this time, was intimately connected with the subject of the 
controversy that had then long been, and indeed, still is, raging 
between the partisans of Murchison, and such students of Geology 
as are of opinion that Sedgwick was entitled to much more credit for 
the results of his long labours on the older Palaeozoic rocks than the 
equally able but more energetic and methodical author of the Silurian 
System had seemed to many willing to admit.
It would be out of 
place here to give even an outline of the evidence adduced in 
support of the views of either party ; but it may suffice to explain 
the nature of the investigations Harkness was now taking a part 
in to state that what Murchison originally meant by Silurian was 
all the rocks from the base of the Hereford "Old Red" down to 
the lowest horizon where the occurrence of fossils had at that time 
been clearly proved.
This line was then generally regarded as 
coincident with the great stratigraphical break known to exist 
between what is now called the Upper Silurian and the Lower.
All the stratified rocks below this stratigraphical break were called 
by Sedgwick Cambrian, and they were at first supposed to be 
entirely devoid of traces of hfe.
Bye and bye fossils began to be 
found at lower and lower horizons ; and as these facts were made 
known, the base of the Silurian System was taken lower and lower, 
so as to coincide with the lowest known life-zone.
At the time 
I am about to refer to, the Lingula Flags were usually regarded as 
the base of the Lower Silurian by Murchison, But Dr. Hicks had 
been hard at work at the older rocks, and had succeeded in 
disclosing evidence of a richly fossiliferous zone lower even than 
the Lingula Flags.
A good idea of the nature of these fossils may 
be gathered from an inspection of the Menevian fossils, as these 
are called, that Harkness collected with Hicks, and that are now 
in the Museum at Carlisle.
It was the discovery of this older life- 
zone that necessitated a still further modification of the base line 
of the Silurian System, and a consequent modification of the views 
that Sir Roderick had himself already published.
There is inde- 
pendent evidence, beside what appears here, that Harkness was 
entering into the discussion of this subject with considerable ardour, 
184 
and with a determination to judge of the facts for himself, without 
regard to any pre-existing views expressed thereon either by himself 
or by others.
What Harkness was doing at this time may best be judged of 
from the next letter : — 
1 6 Belgrave Square, October 14, 1870.
My dear Harkness, 
I shall be very pleased if you bring out any paper in conjunction 
with Dr. Hicks which illustrates the lowest depths to which Silurian Life 
has been detected.
I should, however, be very sorry that you took the place of Salter / who 
in the last few years of his life was always at work in the endeavour to 
undermine my views.
From tjje days of Von Buch to those of Barrande all 
continental geologists have given up the idea of a Cambrian scale of organized 
beings as different from Silurian life.
If Trilobites, whether Conoconjphe or O'enl, be associated with Linfjula, 
it is there that the beds containing them entitle us to mark the base of 
Silurian life.
Bigsby's •'Thesaurus Siluricus," and Davidson's "Silurian 
Brachiopoda, " have long since settled the point.
The "Menevian" strata, etc., and the strata below it, which contain 
these things * * however locally distinguished by different names, are 
but the lowest-known subformations of one great series.
As to the part of your letter that refers to the Edinburgh Chair.
I have 
made my offer provided the Geological Chair be clearly separated from that 
of the Natural History Chair.
You are right in your conjecture that I had Geikie in my mind's eye if 
the first nomination be assigned to me.
But, if ill health should prevent his accepting the offer, it would give me 
great pleasure t^ consider you as next ; for I think you would make an 
excellent teacher of the science in the Scottish Metropolis.
Yours truly, 
R. I.
MURCHISON.
The results of the joint investigation of Harkness and Hicks 
were summed up in a commnnication by the authors, and read 
before the Geological Society soon after the date of the letter just 
cited.
From the date of this paper onward Harkness seems to have 
been indulging in constant hope that the heavy burden imposed 
165 
upon hira by his additional duties at Cork might in some way or 
other be reduced to one that he felt able to sustain.
All chance of the Professorship he had looked forward to 
obtaining having been finally removed, there seemed no prospect 
before him but that of retiring from the Professorship he then held, 
and settling down quietly for the remainder of his life at Penrith^ 
where, at the house of his sister, Mrs. Pearson, he had long been 
accustomed to make his home during the College vacations.
Notwithstanding that, close upon the age of sixty, he was 
beginning to feel himself unequal to the duties he had undertaken 
to perform, his restless energy and untiring enthusiasm would not 
allow him to take the rest he so much required, even when he 
had the opportunity of doing so.
He still continued to attend the 
meetings of the British Association, and from time to time read 
a paper before that body, or before the Geological Society, and 
now and then wrote a review.
It was about this time that Mr. Gordon, of the Penrith Grammar 
School, was organising the valuable courses of lectures that may 
justly be regarded as the first step towards the formation of the 
Penrith Scientific Society.
Mr. Gordon, as is very well known, 
devoted a great deal of time and attention to this very useful work, 
and succeeded, at least for some time, in providing, firee of charge, 
intellectual entertainment of the highest order obtainable.
Hark- 
ness, who was.
ever ready to give his active support to any under- 
taking having for its object the diffusion of scientific knowledge, 
cheerfully gave up part of that time his failing health required him 
to devote to rest, and lectured here session after session until the 
winter lectures were temporarily abandoned.
Plis lectures at 
Penrith chiefly related to Physical Geography, probably because 
he considered that subject better adapted to the tastes of the 
general audience of that time than one on any branch of Geology, 
as generally understood.
I remember, however, that he gave 
one on that favourite topic of his, the Glacial Period.
There 
was another lecture, too, on the "Early History of Mankind," 
wherein he gave a highly-condensed summary of his own extensive 
knowledge of what bad at that; time l^en written, on that subject.
186 
The lectui-e was printed in full in the Cumberland and Westmorland 
Advertiser at the time, and it would be to the advantage of many 
if they were to take the trouble to make themselves masters of the 
principal facts and arguments it contains.
Harkness continued to 
manifest the same kind of interest in everything connected with 
the intellectual advancement of our local Society when Mr. Gordon 
gave up the Grammar School courses, and the winter lectures were 
continued by one of the other founders of the Penrith Society, 
Mr. Tannahill.
I have dealt almost exclusively hitherto upon the chronological 
order of Harkness's Geological work, as being that wherewith his 
name will always be most associated by posterity :.
but no man 
that had followed the course of Geological enquiry as he had for 
so many years, could escape being led by degrees to take an 
interest in that part of Geology that bridges over the interval 
between the later Tertiary period and the dawn of the historic era.
Consequently we find that in everything relating to Pre-Historic 
Archaeology, he had by degrees begun to feel the deepest interest ; 
and, side by side with the investigations he was making here and 
elsewhere in connection with his own especial line of work, he was 
steadily amassing information relating to the early history of man- 
kind in this part of the kingdom.
The results of some of these 
investigations appeared in print ; but that he was possessed of a 
vast fund of information relating to the archaeology of this neigh- 
bourhood that he never committed to print, no one that had spent 
many days with him out of doors here could for a moment doubt.
It must be a matter of regret with many that he did not more 
often come before the public with further contributions to the 
archaeology of our neighbourhood than he has allowed to see the 
light.
In his investigations upon the early history of the Penrith 
neighbourhood, he used to be much associated with a Penrith man 
whose name, Harkness often said, was not as much known to fame 
as it deserved to be.
I refer to Mr. Valance Stalker, of whose 
scientific attainments Harkness was wont to speak in the highest 
terras.
I^arkness's last contribution to Geological literature was written 
187 
conjointly with Professor H.
A. Nicholson, and appeared in the 
Journal of the Geological Society in 1877.
But he wrote one 
other paper on a New Form of Quartz, which was read before the 
Mineralogical Society early in the year following.
At this time he had finally decided upon giving up his appoint- 
ment at Cork, and retiring to Penrith to spend his last days with his 
sister, in the midst of his many friends, and surrounded on all sides 
by geological features wherewith his name must for ever be associ- 
ated.
With this object in view, he had gone for the last time to Cork, 
to make the necessary arrangements, and to take a final leave of 
his students and his colleagues.
But he was fated to see Penrith 
no more.
The arduous nature of the duties he had of late years 
been called upon to perform after thirty years or more largely spent 
in mountain -climbing of a most exhausting nature, had proved too 
great a strain for his constitution.
At Dublin, on the evening of 
the 4th of October, 1878, at the very commencement of the rest he 
had looked forward to for so long, Robert Harkness suddenly fell 
dead of heart disease.
I need not enter into the particulars of the sequel.
We all 
know that his remains were brought over to England, and subse- 
quently laid to rest in the beautiful cemetery at Penrith.
We all 
know how his colleagues at Cork took steps to convey to future 
generations the sentiments they felt towards him, by erecting the 
memorial window that now decorates the Hall of Queen's College, 
Cork.
Nor need I do more than refer to the transfer of his fine 
private collection of fossils, so rich in illustrations of the past life 
of Cumberland and Westmorland, to the Central Museum of the 
district whose geological structure he did so much to elucidate.
Of his relations with the world outside his own family circle, it 
would be impertinent for me to express any opinion, when a writer* 
that both knew him better personally, and was better acquainted 
with his work than I can claim to be, writes of him as follows : — 
"It is now some five-and-thirty years since the name of this able 
geologist first appeared as a writer on his favourite science.
During

this long period he had explored, on foot, the geology of large dis- 
tricts in the north of England, in Scotland, and in various parts of 
Ireland.
The reports of the British Association and the Quarterly 
Journal of the Geological Society bear witness to his industry and 
to the painstaking minuteness of his method of investigation.
To 
him we owe our earliest exact information regarding the correlatives 
of the reptiliferous sandstones of Dumfriesshire and Cumberland.
It was his patient labours continued year after year over ground 
most difficult to unravel, that led the way to the working out of the 
structure of the Silurian uplands of the south of Scotland.
To his 
research, too, is due the identification of the metamorphic rocks of 
the north-west of Ireland with those of the west of Scotland.
To 
the elucidation of every one of the Palaeozoic system of deposits 
he has contributed something of value.
"But important as was his scientific work^ it had not a wider and 
more hearty recognition among his brother geologists than his own 
admirable qualities of head and heart.
Who that has been privi- 
leged with his friendship will not cherish the memory of his 
earnestness over even the driest of details, his quiet enthusiasm, his 
generous admiration for the work of others, his unfailing cheerful- 
ness?
Who will forget that beaming ruddy face, never absent 
from the platform of Section C at the British Association meetings, 
always ready to rise among the speakers there and to reappear at 
the festive gatherings in the evening ?
There have been men who 
have graven their names more deeply on the registers of scientific 
thought and progress, but there have been few whose sunny nature 
has more endeared them in the recollection of their friends than 
Robert Harkness."

CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A LIST OF 
THE MINERALS OCCURRING IN CUMBERLAND 
AND WESTMORLAND.
(Part IL)* 
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, H.M. Geological Survey.
Amongst the minerals occurring in Cumberland and Westmorland 
is a small group referred to collectively as the Ochres, which, 
although they do not belong as a whole to any one group yet 
enumerated, may conveniently be mentioned here before passsing 
on to the next group.
The minerals are all of rare occurrence ; 
and as I have met with none of them myself, I give them as they 
appear in the " List of Minerals of the Lake District," given in 
Jenkinson's "Guide to the Lakes," 6th ed.
(1879,) PP- Ixxvi.

Wright, of Regent Street.

Said to have been found near 
Alston.
The section of minerals next to be enumerated is the Car- 
bonates ; which are arranged in two groups, according as the 
mineral species composing them crystallize in the Rhombic or the 
Hexagonal System.
Aragonite, the rhombic form of Calcic Carbonate, stands first 
on the list.
This mineral species is widely diffused throughout 
the mineral-veins of the two counties, but is, nevertheless, not very 
common at any one locality.
It assumes a considerable variety of 
forms, ranging from stalactitic masses without any definite external 
evidence of crystalline structure, through spheroidal, close-set, 
aggregations of acicular prisms, to the beautiful crystals found in 
West Cumberland and in the Alston district.
Undoubtedly one 
of the most beautiful forms assumed by Aragonite is that known 
under its old name of Flos Jerri, or Coraloidal Aragonite, which 
used to be obtained in some abundance when the Dufton Mines 
were working some years ago.
Its mode of occurrence was described 
in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol.
xxi.
p. 413, 
by Mr. Wm.
Wallace of Alston, the author of a most valuable treatise 
on the Deposition of Lead Ore. In this instance the mineral occurs 
in the form of branching, shrub-like forms, bearing a close resem- 
blance in external form to some species of corals, especially to 
MilleJ>ora, and in colour generally of a beautiful creamy white.
These are found mostly in what the miners call "lochs," "lofs," or 
" lof-holes," or the cavities and small chambers eroded by chemical 
action in the limestone contiguous to the mineral veins.
These 
lofs are often full of clay ; but the face of the solid rock itself is 
coated with groups of crystals of various kinds — Galena, Blende, 
Barytes, Cerussite, and other minerals, as well as with the particular 
species of mineral at present under notice.
Some of these branching 
sprays of Aragonite are as much as a foot, or even eighteen inches, 
across.
Other specimens of the same general form, and occurring 
in the same way, were found some years ago in the well-known 
191 
lead mine of Silvera Band, Milburn Fell, and occasionally also- 
from the mines at Helton, in the same metalliferous area.
Another 
form of Aragonite occurring in thin veins in shale at Dufton, is one 
of the minerals that have been called Satin Spar.
Analyses of 
specimens of this variety have shewn it to contain as high a per- 
centage as 4'2S per cent, of Diallogite, or Manganese Carbonate, 
a mineral that has not yet been proved to exist in a separate 
condition here.
The Satin Spar consists of a succession of en- 
crusting layers composed of close-set, fibrous, silky-looking crystals, 
varying, in different layers, from shades of silvery grey to pure 
glistening' snow-white.
Some specimens shew a faint rosy tint.
Specimens cut and polished in the direction of the length of the 
crystals, exhibit the beautiful satiny lustre whence it derives its name.
Aragonite from the same district assumes a variety of other forms ; 
but none that call for any special remark.
Forms different again 
occur in the Alston district, and in the limestone at Harcla Mines, 
near Kirkby Stephen.
In the haematite district of West Cumberland, the mines yield 
very perfect specimens of Aragonite in the form of diverging groups 
of spire -shaped crystals, some as much as two or three inches in 
length.
Those from Cleator occur in the form of spikes, each 
individual spike having a contour that rounds with a gentle curvar 
ture nearly to a point.
The transverse section of each separate 
spike varies in form, probably because the spike itself represents 
an aggregation of several prisms.
The flutings and striations 
running across the faces of each spike, would seem to indicate, 
also, that the curved contour is due to what is called an oscillatory 
combination of planes appertaining to the prism, with others 
referable to one or other of its observed pyramidal faces.
My 
colleague, Mr. Pringle, has called my attention to a beautiful 
example of this kind in the case of Quartz, exhibited in the 
Collection at the Museum of Practical Geology; and has suggested 
that the above explanation may apply to many cases of crystals 
with curved contours like the Cleator Aragonites referred to.
Crystals of Aragonite similar to these in all essential respects but 
that of size, occur in the Rowtin Gill- and Brandy Gill Mines ; 
192 
also near Keswick, and occasionally at Alston as well.
Some 
beautiful glassy crystals of Aragonite, occurring on Dolomite, have 
been obtained from Nent Force, at the last-named locality.
In regard to the genesis of Aragonite, where it occurs in intimate 
association with the Hexagonal form of the same chemical com- 
pound, no very satisfactory explanation has yet been given.
Differences in the temperature, or in the nature, of the depositing 
solution, may have determined whether the Calcic Carbonate in 
particular cases should crystallize in the one system or in the other ; 
but these explanations will hardly apply in the cases where both 
crystalline forms are found associated in such a manner as to 
suggest that they have crystallized simultaneously, and under 
precisely the same conditions.
The subject seems as yet to be 
but imperfectly understood, as is that of the related subject of the 
distribution of particular crystalline forms in regard to locality.
Further reference will be made to this under Calcite.
WiTHERiTE, Barium Carbonate, occurs in a few localities ; 
chiefly in the lead-mining areas of the Lower Carboniferous rocks.
In most cases it occurs in connection with faults, where they 
traverse, or are connected with, beds of limestone; and it is 
usually found in masses in the rider, or fault-breccia, of mineral 
veins.
In the majority of instances it appears to be associated 
with Barytes and the other minerals above mentioned as occurring 
along with Aragonite.
This mineral crystaUises in the Rhombic 
System ; but quite commonly the fundamental form is modified in 
such a manner as to closely approach some of the forms belonging 
to the Hexagonal System.
Thus, some of the crystals of Witherite 
occurring at Alston, as well as at Dufton and the parts adjoining, 
occur in the form of pseudo-hexagonal pyramids, very much Hke 
one of the commonest crystalline forms of quartz.
Associated with 
crystals of this kind are others consisting of groups of rod-like 
aggregations, each individual crystal of the aggregation consisting 
of a combination of the two terminal planes and the double six- 
faced rhombic pyramid, so that each rod is made up of several 
crystals joined end to end like a string of beads.
Some of the 
Witherite occurring at Dufton is in the form of ball-shaped masses, 
193 
often with the surface studded with the pyramidal ends of the 
separate crystals; while in other cases the surface is nearly as smooth 
as that of a cannon ball.
Almost as commonly Witherite occurs as 
encrusting masses like stalagmite, with a fibrous radiate structure.
In each and every one of these cases the surface of the mineral is 
coated over with a chalky crust.
Beautiful pearly crystals are 
found at Bleagill, Alston.
Witherite has a high commercial value, being employed in the 
manufacture of plate-glass, and of beet-sugar, besides being used 
also in the manufacture of certain pigments.
Our fell-side 
folk employ it as a rat-bane ; and it is said to be so noxious 
that even the small quantity carried down in suspension in the 
water of streams draining areas where this mineral is worked, is 
sufficient to cause death in the smaller animals, and to give rise to 
serious disturbances of health in the case of the larger, even at a 
distance of three or four miles from the point where the poisonous 
detritus first enters the stream.
Strontianite, Strontium Carbonate, is said to have been ob- 
tained from the Alston district, but I have been unable to discover 
on what evidence its existence as a separate mineral has been 
claimed for Cumberland.
Cerussite, Plumbic Carbonate, the " White Ore " of miners, is 
of general occurrence in connection with Galena.
It seems, as a rule, 
to occur chiefly in those parts of mineral veins that are most exposed 
to the influence of surface-waters, just as might be expected in the 
case of a mineral that is almost certainly a decomposition-product 
of other ores of lead.
In the Caldbeck Fells, and, to a smaller 
extent, also in other mines, large masses of what were evidently at 
one time solid crystals of Galena, may be found with the inner 
parts of the crystal eaten almost entirely away, and the corroded 
surface of the interior irregularly lined with Cerussite.
Some of 
these groups of crystals, especially at Brandy Giil, are in the form 
of stellate macles, like six-rayed stars.
Others, especially the 
Cerussites from Braithwaite Mine, Force Crag Mine, Newlands, 
Goldscope, Thornthwaite, and other places in the Keswick 
district, occur in the form of tuft-like groups of slendef prisms, 
13 
194 
with a lustre closely approaching that of the diamond in brilliancy.
The same remark applies also to Driggith Mine, and various 
other mines in the Caldbeck Fells ; to Greenside Mines at the head 
of Ullswater ; and to various mines in the Alston district, as well 
as in other localities not so generally well-known.
Beautiful 
groups from Braithwaite Mines adorn both the National Collec- 
tions, as well as most private collections of any extent.
It is not a little remarkable that Cerussite should be so commonly 
associated with Galena, while Anglesite, the Plumbic Sulphate, 
should be very local in its distribution.
On theoretical grounds, 
Anglesite ought to be found wherever Galena is undergoing con- 
version into the Carbonate ; as the Sulphide is supposed, as the 
initial step in its alteration, to combine with a further proportion 
of Oxygen, and thus to pass first into the Sulphate before going 
over to the condition of Carbonate.
The fact that Anglesite and 
Cerussite occur side by side as decomposition-products of one and 
the same crystal of Galena, as happens in the Caldbeck Fells for 
example, while in other districts the Cerussite occurs alone, and 
that, too, without shewing any signs of having passed through the 
preliminary stage of Anglesite, would seem to indicate that the 
formation of Cerussite from Galena is due frequently to conversion 
direct from the Sulphide.
Were the case otherwise, Anglesite, 
seeing that it is nearly as stable a compound as the other lead 
salt, ought to be of at least equally common occurrence as a 
decomposition-product, which is certainly not the case in the lead 
mines of the North-West of England.
Cerussite is very valuable as an ore of lead ; but in Cumberland 
and Westmorland it rarely occurs in sufficient quantity to render 
it of much importance in a commercial aspect.
It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that the " old man'" (as metal 
miners in the North call the former workers of mines, as well as 
the results of those Avorkers' labours,) seems often to have been 
unaware of the value of this mineral as an ore of lead, and to have 
rejected it along with the refuse as worthless " deads." In the 
case of mines where this has happened, modern improvements in 
the dressing of ores have rendered it worth while to sort over and 
195 
dress the contents of the "dead heaps;" in some cases with con- 
siderable profit to the miner.
The second group of Anhydrous Carbonates comprises such as 
crystallize in the Hexagonal System.
Next to Quartz, Calcite, Calcic Carbonate, is by far the most 
widely-diffused mineral occurring in the two counties.
This is 
especially the case in the part of the district occupied by the 
Carboniferous Limestone Series.
The mineral occurs in an almost 
endless variety of crystalline combinations ; and it is hardly too 
much to say that within the limits of the district under consider- 
ation, as great a variety of crystalline forms of this mineral are to 
be found as may be gathered from the mines of all the rest of the 
world put together.
It may be worth while again to direct attention 
to the fact, already alluded in the case of Aragonite, and long 
well-known to practical men, that particular crystalline forms, or 
crystalline combinations, prevail at particular localities, while the 
same mineral obtained from adjoining localities, perhaps from 
veins of the same kind traversing rocks of precisely the same 
nature, and, to all appearance, produced under just the same 
circumstances, may be characterized by forms entirely different.
This is true, of course, of many other minerals than Calcite, and is 
sufficiently well known to miners and persons accustomed to handle 
large numbers of minerals from a variety of locaHties as to enable 
them to decide, in many cases without the slightest hesitation, 
what particular district, or even what particular mine, a given 
mineral may have come rom.
To describe these differences, in 
the case of the mineral under notice, would involve crystallographic 
details a little out of place in a paper like the present ; but it is a 
subject that has been by no means worked out, and might well 
form the subject of a series of investigations by some of our local 
mineralogists, or others that have the requisite variety of specimens 
before their eyes.
As instances of some of the varieties of form, I 
would refer to the combinations of obtuse- and acute-rhombohedra, 
and of these with hexagonal prisms, which are common in the 
Alston district; the large prisms with a combination of the terminal 
196 
plane and one or more sets of rhombic faces, from Greenside ; the 
thin, disc-like, tabular crystals occurring at both the last-named 
localities ; the aggregations of small prisms with rhombic ends 
built up into groups having the external form of large scalenohedra, 
which are found in such perfection at Helton ; and many others 
whose mere enumeration would alone be sufficient to occupy four 
or five of the present pages.
Calcite occurs of various shades of colour, from perfectly clear 
glassy crystals through various shades of cream colour, grey, or 
pale brown, to salmon colour, or rose.
Encrustations of radiating 
crystals of the last-named tint occur in connection with the Car- 
boniferous Limestone near Kendal.
Other forms of Calcite, or what is commonly regarded as such, 
are the stalactites and stalagmites found in caverns in limestone 
districts, as well as the travertine from calcareous springs.
Mr.
Bryce M.
Wright, in his List, refers to good examples of this last 
at Park Head, near Hesket-New-Market.
Others of the same 
kind are of general occurrence wherever springs are thrown out at 
the junction of any widely-jointed limestone rock and an imper- 
vious bed beneath it.
Calcite very commonly appears as a pseudomorph retaining the 
external form of some other mineral, which has been gradually 
removed in solution, while Calcite has as gradually occupied the 
vacant space.
Very frequently crystals of one kind have been 
invested with a coating of minerals of a kind quite different ; then 
the first-formed mineral has been removed in solution, and the 
vacant space it occupied either filled with other substances or else 
left vacant.
As a rule it is the more stable compound that stands 
longest, and the least stable that is first to go.
But Professor H.
A. Nicholson called my attention some years ago to a remarkable 
exception to this rule, occurring at Dufton.
In this, crystals of 
Barytes, one of the most insoluble substances known, had been 
invested by Calcite, and afterwards entirely removed in solution, 
leaving the cavity it formerly occupied entirely empty.
What the 
solvent was that brought about the removal of the Barytes without 
affecting the easily-acted-upon Calcite, is not by any means clear.
197 
Calamine, Zinc Carbonate, occurs in the same way in relation 
to Blende, or Zinc Sulphide, as Cerussite does to Galena; and, 
like it, also originates from the decomposition of the sulphide.
Calamine, however, is not of very common occurrence, even where 
Blende is found in abundance.
This may be due to the fact that 
the decomposition of Blende gives rise to the Sulphate, whose 
instability favours its removal in solution almost as fast as it is 
formed, while the conditions for the formation of the Carbonate 
are not usually quite as favourable.
Calamine usually occurs in 
connection with the rider, or fault-breccia, of mineral veins, generally 
in such parts of the vein as are within the influence of carbonated 
waters percolating downwards from the surface.
The principal localities in the two counties are in the neighbour- 
hood of Alston, especially at Farnberry Mine.
Other localities are 
the mines situated on the steep south-western edge of the same great 
upland tract, more especially at Dufton ; and the mines in and around 
what are known as the Caldbeck Fells.
The Alston specimens 
occur chiefly in the form of encrusting groups of spheroids, with a 
concentric banding resulting from deposition in successive layers, 
and with a radiate structure due to the presence of the separate 
prisms.
Considerable variety in both external form and colour 
may be observed, some appearing hke dull, chalky-looking encrust- 
ations, investing portions of fault-breccia, while others assume the 
character of groups of a more-evidently crystalline character.
The 
prevailing colour is a peculiar dull greenish-yellow, something 
between gamboge and a pale tint of olive; and the same specimen 
not unfrequently exhibits a variety of tints in different layers, 
which, when the mineral is cut and polished for inlaying or other 
ornamental purposes, give rise to a very pleasing effect.
Similar 
fibrous radiating groups of the same general tint occur at Dufton, 
and the mines in the districts adjoining.
The Caldbeck Fell specimens mostly come from Rowtin Gill, 
and occur there also as dull chalky-looking encrustations on the 
materials composing the fault-breccia.
In tint these vary from 
smoke grey, or dull lead-colour, through sapphire-blue, or lavender, 
to nearly a cobalt-blue.
It is remarkable that, though Blende is 
198 
one of the commonest minerals at this locality, Calamine should be 
comparatively rare, while the Zinc SiUcate should be much more 
common.
One of the prettiest minerals occurring in Cumberland and 
Westmorland is the pearly-looking, usually cream-coloured, mineral, 
with curved rhombic faces of crystallization, so commonly found 
as a sparry incrustation on the haematites from Cleator, the 
Blende from Alston and from Keswick, and the crystals of Galena 
from Greenside Mines.
This is one form or the other of Dolo- 
mite, which is essentially a double carbonate of Lime and 
Magnesia.
The best known specimens of this form from the 
Alston district, come from Nent Head and Garrigill.
But the 
mineral in a less-showy form is of common occurrence as the 
crystalline lining of the geodes, or drusy cavities, that characterise 
the limestones of the Carboniferous series wherever their original 
condition has been changed by the infiltrations of magnesian 
solutions from the New Red. This is especially the case around 
Shap, and all along the line of outcrop of the impure, arenaceous, 
or earthy, limestones of that part of the Mountain Limestone so 
well exposed there.
The original carbonate of lime of the lime- 
stone has been partly changed into magnesian limestone, as a 
consequence of the infiltration referred to ; and the rock, in 
undergoing the change in its comppsition, has changed also in its 
dimensions, shrinking to a smaller bulk, so that a process the 
reverse of what takes place in a cooling lava, has favoured the 
development of a cellular or cavernous, or, as it is termed, 
drusy, character throughout the more highly-altered portions of 
the rock.
In these drusy cavities the Dolomite has crystallized 
out, sometimes in very pretty crystals, as may be seen by 
the beautiful specimens presented to the Carlisle Museum by 
Mr. Robert Crowder.
Some Iron-peroxide, and, apparently also, 
some Magnesian Carbonate, have been combined in varying pro- 
portions with the other constituents of the Dolomite, and have 
imparted to it sometimes the one, sometimes the other, of their 
respective characteristic shades of colour.
Some of these druses 
are sufficiently capacious to hold half a pint of water, but more 
199 
commonly they are about the size of a walnut.
When exposed to 
the weather, nearly all these dolomites change through cream-colour 
to saffron-yellow, or to dull ochreous tints, as a consequence of the 
change of part of their iron into Limonite.
Analyses of Dolomite 
from our district shew a proportion of Iron carbonate ranging up 
to ten per cent.
At the Caldbeck Fell mining area ferriferous Dolomite is common, 
along with the vein-stuff, perhaps as a result of the mingling of 
magnesian solutions with others containing Lime carbonate re- 
sulting from the decomposition of the volcanic- and other crystalline 
rocks traversed by the veins, before the last of tlie New Red was 
denuded from the plain now represented by the Fell tops there.
Dolomites with much the same general aspect, but weathering 
with a beautiful rich golden-brown iridescent surface, are found at 
Helton Mines, near Brough ; and specimens having the same 
lustre and play of colours, from the West Cumberland area, were 
presented a year or so since to the British Museum, by Miss S.
H. 
Bayles.
Very pretty groups of madder-brown crystals were got from a 
vein traversing the volcanic green-slates at the head of UUswater.
The alteration of limestone into masses of a dolomitic character 
has affected considerable thicknesses of rock in many instances.
In most of these the conversion, or replacement, has taken place 
across the bedding of the rock ; thereby rendering it evident that 
the dolomitic character is due to causes affecting the rock after its 
deposition, and not, as some have supposed in the instances under 
notice, to original differences of composition.
The alteration in 
some cases has proceeded so far as to convert bands, or dyke-like 
masses of the rock into a crumbling mass of crystals, which have a 
gritty feel to the touch, so as to bear no inconsiderable resemblance 
to loose-grained sandstones.
Instances are not wanting wherein 
people whose education ought to have taught them better have 
actually regarded these dolomitized limestones as veritable sand- 
stones.
The relative hardness of quartz grains to dolomite affords 
a ready means of distinguishing between the two : where other 
means are not available, the face of a geological hammer rubbed 
200 
over the surface of the rock will help to distinguish them at once.
I have long been accustomed, in field geology, to discriminate 
between them by merely scraping the sole of an iron-shod boot 
over the rock.
The iron will slip easily enough over the rock 
when it is dolomite, but it is rasped in a manner that is unmistake- 
able when the rock under foot is sandstone.
SiDERiTE, Chalybite, Spathose Iron, or White Iron Ore, the 
Iron-Carbonate, is another generally-diffused mineral, though it 
occurs in noticeable quantities only in a few localities.
These are 
chiefly in connection with the faults traversing the great upland 
tract whose fell-tops form a great plain inclined from the line of 
the Cross Fell escarpment in the direction of the Tyne Valley.
Here the ore occurs chiefly in the form of rider, or vein-stuff in 
the fault-breccia ; but Professor Warington Smyth states that the 
limestone adjoining the veins has itself been converted into 
Siderite, which constitutes "flots," similar in their general character 
to the lateral ramifications already referred to as one of the modes 
of occurrence of Galena.
The formation of Siderite has, however, 
in this instance, clearly been due to the partial replacement 
of the limestone in sitit, in a manner analagous to that referred to 
under Dolomite.
Indeed, it seems far from unlikely that Dolomite 
may have formed a preliminary stage in the alteration ; and that 
the formation of both minerals may be due to the influence of 
solutions infiltring downwards through fault-fissures before the New 
Red had been denuded from the old surface whose remains now 
form the fell-tops there.
In the part of the district now referred 
to, Siderite occurs in quantities sufficient to constitute deposits of 
some commercial importance.
In other parts of the district it 
rarely occurs in quantities that will pay for working.
Siderite, in an impure form, mixed with earthy matter, occurs in 
the form of nodular concretions, locally known as "cat heads," in 
some of the shales of the Carboniferous series.
These are occa- 
sionally found in quantities sufficient to pay for working.
In the 
Argill Coal Field, described in Part VII.
of the Transactions, 
mention was made of some nodules of clay-ironstone that have 
been converted superficially into haematite, by the partial replace- 
201 
ment of the Iron Carbonate by the Peroxide.
This was, almost 
certainly, effected by means of the infiltration of the same ferriferous 
solutions that stained the associated sandstones their present deep 
red tint.
The Froghall Ironstone of Staffordshire affords another 
example of the same nature.
In this a band of clay carbonate of 
iron has been partially, and, in some parts, entirely, altered into 
haematite.
The alteration in this latter case is to be attributed to 
the same causes that have developed the haematitic character in 
the Argill Coal Field, namely, the percolation of water charged 
with iron in solution, derived from the New Red Rocks before 
they were denuded from that part.
Professor Warington Smyth is of opinion that the formation of 
Siderite, at least in the .\lston district, is going on at the present 
day, as Mr. Attwood found a rod of malleable-iron partly coated 
with this mineral, which must therefore be, in this case, of later- 
formation than the date of introduction of the iron rod into the 
mine (see Q.
J. Science, V.
p. 36).
Professor Smyth adds the 
remark that the Siderite " invests, as a crystalline encrustation, the 
previously-fornj^d crystals of Fluor spar and of Galena ; and the 
striking manner in which it is found to coat only those surfaces 
which face in a particular direction is well worthy of attention in 
the study of these obscure phenomena." 
Alstonite, or Bromlite, the Double Carbonate of Lime and 
Barytes, is one of the minerals that are, so far as our present 
knowledge extends, confined to one locality.
Alstonite is found 
at Fallowfield, as well as at Bromley Hill, and some of the other 
mines near to Alston.
It has not yet been found in any other 
part of the world.
In appearance some specimens of this mineral 
bear a certain superficial resernblance to Aragonite, as it crystallizes 
in forms belonging to the same system, and has much the same 
lustre and colour.
More commonly, however, it is found in the 
form of groups of small, snow-white, acute pyramids, generally 
about a quarter of an inch from base to apex.
Frequently these 
pyramids are doubled, base to base.
These occur lining cavities 
in the rider, generally in the parts of the vein that traverse beds of 
202 
limestone.
Slight variations in tint occur, and some specimens 
are of a greyish colour, while others are almost of a rose red tint.

Like Aragonite and Calcite, Pyrites and Marcasite, and some 
other minerals not so well known, the chemical compound now 
under consideration presents us with a good example of dimorphism 
— the compound crystallizing, in the case of Alstonite, in forms 
belonging to the Hexagonal System, while in the other form of the 
same chemical compound, Barytocalcite, the crystals belong to 
the System known as the Monoclinic.
Like Alstonite, Baryto- 
calcite is rarely, or never, found in any locality far from Alston, so 
that it has as good a claim to be regarded as a mineral peculiar 
to Cumberland as Alstonite has.
It occurs in association with 
Galena, Barytes, Fluor, etc., in veins traversing the Yoredale 
Rocks — generally in connection with the beds of limestone of that 
series — and is found both massive, and crystallized, either lining 
cavities in the rider or in the rock adjoining the veins, or else 
investing fragments of fault-breccia.
The crystallized forms occur 
as divergent groups of slender, prismatic crystals, shooting out in 
various directions from their basal points of attachment.
The 
individual crystals sometimes attain a length of nearly two inches ; 
but a more common size is about one-fourth of that.
The terminal 
faces are oblique to the axis, so that the general form of each 
individual crystal reminds one somewhat of the graver used in 
engraving on wood.
The mineral is usually translucent, and has 
a lustre between that of glass and of resin.
It varies in tint from 
nearly colourless to various shades of yellowish and grey, 
Another division of the same group is formed by the Hydrated 
Carbonates.
One of these a rare mineral, well-represented in the British 
Museum by Cumberland specimens, is Hydrozincite, or Zinc 
Bloom.
This occurs in the veins of the Alston district chiefly in 
203 
the form of niammilary encrustations of a chalky- or pipe-clay-like 
aspect, but exhibiting traces of both radiate structure and lamellar, 
concentric banding, due to deposition in successive coats.
This is 
one of the minerals that a careful search might bring to light in 
the Caldbeck Fells, especially in the neighbourhood of Rowtin 
Gill.
Another mineral, even rarer still, is represented in the British 
Museum by specimens from both the Alston district and Rowtin 
Gill, in the Caldbeck Fells.
This is Aurichalcite, or Green 
Calamine, the Hydrous Carbonate of Zinc and Copper, represented 
by the formula 2CuC -i- 3ZnH.
Mr. Br}'ce Wright states (pp.
cii.) 
that this mineral is "found associated with Malachite at Rowtin 
Gill in an extremely hard ochreous rock." The British Museum 
specimens, which occur on saccharoidal quartz in association with 
Linarite, are in the form of mammilary aggregations of minute 
acicular crystals of a pale greenish-blue or turquoise tint, ranging 
to nearly emerald green.
The Alston specimens are small, and 
they occur as velvety encrustations of a turquoise green colour.
Malachite, Hydrous Copper Carbonate, has been mentioned 
several times as occurring in various localities in the district under 
consideration.
Indeed, it may safely be stated that, wherever 
copper ore in any form occurs, Malachite occurs as a decomposition- 
product along with it Its bright verdigris-green, or emerald-green, 
tint, is sure to attract attention, so that it is observed perhaps with 
more frequency than almost any of the other ores.
It varies in 
form from mere stains, to thick encrusting masses, under a great 
variety of circumstances ; but in every, or nearly every case, in 
connection, direct or indirect, with faults.
Like Galena, a mineral 
it is often associated with, this ore occurs indiscriminately in either 
the Carboniferous rocks, or in the older series beneath them.
It 
is not yet known — in this district, at all events — to occur in any 
of the New Red, as it does at Alderly Edge in Cheshire, and 
elsewhere.
In the Carboniferous rocks it occurs, preferably, in 
connection with limestone, at Clouds, Orton Scars, Harcla, Win ton, 
Helton, and other places.
In the Alston district it is not at all 
rare; but in no case has it been found in very large quantities.
It 
204 
is worth of remark that stains of Malachite may now and then be 
traced to the decomposition of Pyrites, which frequently includes 
a notable percentage of Copper Sulphide in its composition.
Another point worth calling attention to is the marked association 
of the Green Carbonate with the veins of silicified limestone, 
already referred to under Quartz.
In the Lake district the mineral is of common occurrence, 
though not in quantities sufficient to render it of much commercial 
importance.
The beautiful mammilated Malachite, familiar to most persons 
as being employed for ornamental purposes, comes from foreign 
localities ; as, though the mineral does occasionally occur in such 
forms in our district, the masses are rarely of either sufficient 
purity, or size, to be available for that purpose.
On the other 
hand, while Malachite in the form of crystals is by no means 
common elsewhere, many excellent examples have been obtained 
from the renowned locality of the Caldbeck Fells.
The crystals 
referred to are found chiefly at Rowtin Gill, Haygill-, and Mexico 
Mines ; and Mr. Bryce Wright gives, as other localities, Carrock 
End, and Dale Head, and also Stavely, near Windermere.
The 
Rowtin Gill specimens occur in the form of groups of very slender 
acicular prisms, with a silky adamantine lustre and an emerald- 
green colour, which shoot inwards towards the centre of some of 
the cavities in the vein-stuff.
In every case Malachite seems to be 
clearly due to the decomposition of other minerals containing 
Copper.
Malachite is sometimes used as a pigment, under the name of 
Mountain Green ; but it is not very permanent.
The other hydrated Copper Carbonate, Azurite, or Chessylite, 
occurs under much the same conditions as the last-named species, 
and at many of the same localities.
It is, however, of much less 
common occurrence.
Occasionally this mineral is found well 
crystallized, and its rich deep-blue tint renders it one of the most 
beautiful of the minerals occurring in our district.

LOCAL SCIENTIFIC NOTES & MEMORANDA.
FOOTPRINTS IN THE PENRITH SANDSTONE.
In a sandstone quarry about three miles in a south-easterly 
direction from Penrith, and on the north-west side of the Penrith- 
Alston Road, I have lately met with footprints of what would 
appear to be those of several distinct species of four-footed 
vertebrates.
They were found on the natural faces of bedding of 
the rock, which is strongly false-bedded in various directions 
towards the west.
The character of the footprints varies consider- 
ably in different specimens, in regard to both the size of the 
impressions and their general form and disposition.
These will 
be described in detail in a future communication.
In the mean 
time I am securing every slab shewing vestiges of the almost- 
unknown fauna of this part of the New Red Series, and am 
carefully recording every fact likely in any way to throw light 
upon this obscure part of the Geological Record.
Casts of each 
slab have been taken, and will be exhibited in one of the local 
museums ; but I shall be happy to shew the originals to any one 
interested in the subject.

THE ICELAND FALCON IN CUMBERLAND.
A FEMALE of the above bird was shot near Crossfell on October 
13th, i860.
It came into the possession of Mr. Blackett Green- 
well of Alston, who preserved it ; and it afterward passed, I 
believe, into the Collection of Mr. Hancock of Newcastle.
Mr.
Greenwell still retains the bones and some of the wing feathers of 
the bird.
Its weight was two-and-three-quarter pounds.
Its 
length was twenty-three and a half inches ; from tip to tip of the 
wings, fifty inches.
From the carpel joint to tip of wing, fifteen 
and a half inches.
The wings were pointed, first and fourth 
primaries of equal length, with the second feather longest.
The 
legs and toes were lead-coloured, and were feathered to within 
half an inch of the foot, and were very strong.
Beak, cere, orbits, 
lead-colour ; eyes, dark ; a narrow pale pinkish-red margin round 
base of bill.
The wings were shorter than the tail by three inches.
The upper surface of the body and the wing-coverts were dull 
ash-brown, with white spots.
The under-surface was white, with 
longitudinal streaks of ash-brown.
A very faint dark patch on the 
side of the cheek.

THE WAX WING.
( Bombycivora garrula.) 
During the winter of 1882-3, six specimens of this bird were 
obtained in the neighbourhood of Carlisle.
One out of a small 
flock at Teufit Green, Harker (Teufit is a local name for the 
Peewit), on December i8th; one at Brunstock on December 
26th — probably another of the same flock; Wragmire, January 
8th, one; Grange Bank, Wigton, January 13th, one; Kirklinton, 
January 27th, one; Cotehill, February 26th, one.
The waxen-like 
tips on the wing feathers numbering from four to seven.

THE SEA-OWL OR LUMP-FISH.
(Cydopteris lumpus.) 
A VERY fine specimen of this fish, in a perfectly fresh condition 
was found dead on the bank of the river Eden, at Rockchffe after 
ebb of morning tide, on March rsth, 1883.
Being a form entirely 
strange to the fishermen there, it was sent to Carlisle for identifi 
cation.

COAL MEASURES BELOW THE NEW RED 
SANDSTONE.
An article in the "Carlisle Journal" of September 7th, on "The 
Trade of West Cumberland," treats, among other matters, of the 
prospects of finding coal north of the line of fault which at present 
bounds the coal-workings on the north from Maryport to, and 
east of, Brayton.
The writer remarks: — "Since the Earl of 
Lonsdale bored near St. Bees and about five miles from White- 
haven, on the southern portion of the Cumberland Coal-fields, and 
found coal at a great depth underlying the New Red Sandstone, it 
has frequently been stated by engineers that the great fault would 
cause coal to be found to the north as well as to the south.
Under these circumstances, it is highly probable that the Cumber- 
land Coal-field extends much nearer Carlisle than is generally 
supposed." 
The remarks quoted seem to imply a notion that the faulted 
line in question is not altogether one whose general effect is as 
obvious as that of one of the numerous faults which affect only the 
Coal-Measures.
Tl^js faulted boundary, however, is a simple line 
of dislocation without any mysterious influences ; and it forms the 
209 
boundary of the Red Sandstone about Aspatria and Brayton, in 
consequence of the enormous denudation that has taken place 
since the fault came into existence.
A simple diagram will illus- 
trate this better than many words could do.
We have only to suppose the rocks of the district to be planed 
down to the level of the line A B, or thereabouts, and the present 
state of things naturally follows.
On the southern or upthrow-side 
of the fault, both the Red Sandstone and a considerable mass of 
the Coal-Measures have been removed.
On the northern the 
destruction has been of the Red Sandstone and beds above it.
There can be no doubt of the existence of Coal Measures north of 
the fault, at any given spot, provided that they also exist there 
south of it.
But as the Red Sandstone lies unconformably on the 
Carboniferous beds of various ages, the coal-bearing value of the 
latter, when reached, may vary immensely in a very short lateral 
distance.
The writer in the " Carlisle Journal " also remarks that 
Mr. Brockbank of Moor Park, after surveying the neighbourhood 
of Aikton Pasture some years ago, came to the conclusion that 
"it would be unwise to expend any capital in the hopes'of meeting 
with the Coal-Measures in this locality." The reason, however, of 
this was that Mr. Brockbank discovered that certain dark shales, 
etc., about Aikton, which had been supposed to be Carboniferous, 
were really Liassic.
Consequently, both the Red Sandstone and 
the Lias lie above the Carboniferous rocks in that locality.
The 
true problem is not as to the existence of Carboniferous beds north 
of the fault ; but whether they are — at a given spot — sufficiently 
14 
210 
rich in coal, and at a moderate depth.
Any information on the 
geology of Cumberland bordering the Solway will be welcome to 
the geologist, as few districts anywhere are so devoid of sections.

DISCOVERY OF MAMMALIAN REMAINS AT 
SILLOTH.
In a paragraph in the "Carlisle Journal" of April 27th, 1883, 
signed J.L., an account was given of discoveries made during the 
excavations for Silloth New Docks.
The uppermost eleven feet 
showed nothing but sand and gravel.
But about sixteen feet 
below the surface, and twenty feet below the level of low water 
at ordinary spring tides, there was a band containing shells of 
existing species of Mussel, Cockle, Oyster, and Whelk.
The first 
mammalian relic was found in gravel, about seventeen feet from 
the surface, and consisted of an antler of the Red-Deer, twenty-six 
inches in length, and having five tines.
At about the same level 
was an enormous humerus, which weighed five pounds twelve 
ounces, and measured eighteen inches in length.
About ten feet 
lower still, and " about three feet above the clay," a large well- 
preserved vertebra was found, weighing about four pounds.
Professor Turner of Edinburgh, has pronounced the humerus to 
be that of Bos primigenius, and the vertebra to be one from the 
tail of a Fin-whale.
Mr. E.
T. Newtown, Asst.
Nat. to the Geol.
Survey, who has 
(since the paragraph quoted from was written,) also seen these 
bones, agrees with Professor Turner as to their determination.

BOS PRIMIGENIUS AND THE CHILLINGHAM 
WILD CATTLE.
As regards Bos primigenius— a.
writer in the "^Saturday Review" of 
July 28th, (article on Belford and Chillingham) — appears to think 
that this species did not exist in Britain before the Saxon Invasion, 
though the mightiest of all the beasts of chase that roamed in the 
forests of Germany.
Therefore, as the Chillingham Wild Cattle 
are admitted to show the nearest approach among existing breeds 
to the characteristics of Bos priinigenius, he asks whether we are 
to believe that the Chillingham Cattle have preserved their freedom 
from prehistoric times, or are they relapsed descendants of domes- 
ticated cattle brought over "in the keels of Hengest or of Ida;" 
and inclines to the last-named view as the "less romantic" of the 
two.
But the Silloth humerus alone is sufficient to show the 
existence of Bos primigcnws in Britain long before the Fifth 
Century.
And if by "romantic" is meant wild and fanciful, the 
notion that Hengest and Ida sailed on piratical or colonizing 
expeditions with domesticated examples of Bos primigenius on 
board, seems eminently deserving of that epithet ; while the 
alternative view offers no difficulties whatever.

NOTE ON SHAWK BECK.
On referring lately to Hutchinson's " History of Cumberland," in 
order to ascertain the various spelUngs of the name of the above 
stream, I found a detailed account of the rocks quarried along its 
course above East Curthwaite.
It was the more interesting to me, 
because, on the previous day, I had been inspecting Farey's well- 
known section across the Wealden District of S.E. England (1806), 
and had been much struck by the mixture of light with utter 
darkness displayed in his notions of geological structure ; and the 
writer in Hutchinson must have written fifteen to twenty years 
212 
before Farey.
While Farey showed a correct knowledge of the 
order of superposition of the Wealden rocks, his drawing exhibited 
the most striking contrast to the slightly-curved and gently-flowing 
lines which would have been displayed in any approximation to 
the actual arrangement.
On the contrary, the strata appeared to 
be broken up by dislocatians at intervals of a kW hundred yards, 
andjbeds far below the uppermost strata were shown rising almost 
to the surface in the intervals between the disjointed blocks of 
upper rock.
Some alluvium, also, was shown in its true place as 
regards the surface, but appeared to be ended laterally by faults 
on each side, and to extend downwards many hundreds of feet.
No section is drawn by the author in Hutchinson ; but his remarks 
show a similar mixture of superficial truth with utter want of insight 
•into geological structure.
His account of the nature and dip of 
the various rocks is perfectly true, but any attempt at section- 
drawing would have been no advance on Farey's.
After stating 
that while the freestone N.
of the limestone dips northward, the 
limestone and the stone southward of it dip to the S.E., he naively 
remarks : — " What a strange diversity in nature must be here, 
where these various strata nearly approach each other !
" And 
later, referring to the patch of (Permian) flaggy red sandstone* 
brought in again by a fault a little southward of the limestone, he 
says: — "They appear to be a stray strata (sic) of stone, but lie 
similar to the other freestone quarries." Of the limestone he states 
that while "in all probability it continues across the country from 
sea to sea, in a direction nearly E.N.E.; it is less than one hundred 
yards in width where it shows itself at Choke Beck." No attempt 
at any explanation of the relations of these various beds to each 
other is given.
Of course a much more modern geologist might 
easily make a mistake in explaining a section in which (as in this 
case) both a fault and an unconformity are present.
But the 
remarks quoted from Hutchinson, like the section drawn by Farey, 
show that to men with their notions of geological structure no 
explanation was possible.
A junior student of geology stated a 
year or two ago, in an examination, that unconformities existed 
* See Trans.

Assoc, Part VII.

213 
where "the rules of geology" had not been observed.
But the 
older writers quoted seem hardly to have recognised the existence 
of any "rules" regulating the arrangement and distribution of 
rocks.

REMAINS OF THE BEAVER IN WESTMORLAND.
A FKW years back the people at the Cross Keys Inn, Cautla, 
between Ressondale and Sedbergh, had, on the mantle-piece of 
their sitting-room, the skull of an adult Beaver.
This was obtained 
from some alluvium in the bottom of the Ressondale Valley, near 
Clouds, and is worth recording as one of the few instances, if not 
the sole instance, of the former occurrence of this animal in West- 
morland.

BOS PRIMIGENIUS IN WESTMORLAND.
In the hall at Howgill Castle is preserved a fine specimen of the 
skull of a gigantic Bos, almost certainly belonging to this species.
It was dug out of a moss near Brough, and is said to have been 
one of two skulls of the same kind, which were found together 
with their horn-cores interlocked in such a way as to suggest that 
they were mired while engaged in fighting.
A large horn-core 
belonging to the same gigantic species of Ox was found in the 
moss next to Sunbiggen Tarn about seventeen years ago.

THE BLACK RAT IN WESTMORLAND.
It may not be generally known that the Black Rat yet lingers in 
small numbers about the fell-side farms in Westmorland.
It is no 
214 
uncommon thing for specimens of this species to be captured in 
the barns and out-houses, at Milburn, for example : but the species 
is every year becoming rarer, and will doubtless soon be as entirely 
supplanted by its foreign congener there as it has been elsewhere.

EPIPACTIS PALVSTRIS IN CUMBERLAND.
In 1880 I found Epipactis palustris, the rare Marsh Epipactis, 
growing in small numbers in a bog near Penrith.

mentioned, succeeded in discovering other specimens of the species 
at the same locality.

PYRRHOTITE.
Pyrrhotite, or Magnetic Pyrites ( Fey Ss ) occurs in a quartz- 
vein traversing the Carboniferous rocks at Smittergill Head, in 
the Alston District.
It is found in the form of blade-like masses, 
somewhat irregular in their mode of occurrence, which fill up the 
interspaces in the quartz-rider of the fault-breccia in such a manner 
as to suggest that they represent broken fragments of masses that 
were once more regular in form, rather than minerals crystallized 
as they are now found.
The mineral has a granular fracture, a 
215 
dull metallic lustre, and a colour something between that of 
ordinary Pyrites and of Copper, or, more like Kupfernickel.
This colour is observed, as a rule, only in the freshly-fractured 
surface, as the speedy tarnish of this mineral soon leaves its 
exterior of a various duller tints, ranging to umber-brown, with 
traces here and there of seme faint iridescence.
The lamellae exhibit curved faces in some instances; but whether 
the curvature is due to original crystallization, or to subsequent 
disturbances affecting the mass, does not seem quite clear.

^rpcetbmgs at t)^t Annual Meeting at ^enrtt^, 1884.
The Ninth Annual Meeting of the Association was held at Penrith on 
the 5th and 6th of June, 1884.
After hearing the President's Address, which 
was delivered in the Mission Rooms, a company representing all the Societies 
affiliated to the Association, met at the Crown Hotel, where about sixty 
members sat down to lunch.
At 2 p.m. the party, joined by a further contingent, entered the waggonettes 
and drove through Lowther Park to the Castle.
The drive through the 
beautifully- wooded scenery alongside the Lowther was much enjoyed, as the 
weather was all that could be wished, and tlie trees were in their full spring 
beauty.
Arrived at the Castle, the visitors were conducted through the 
building, and shewn through the picture-galleries, which contain a large 
number of paintings by Hogarth, as well as examples of Titian, and several 
other masters.
In the galleries of antiquities the \'isitors inspected some 
interesting examples of Roman and other remains found at different times at 
Plumpton, Old Carlisle, and other places in the district.
After examining the magnificent collections of plate, the visitors passed 
through the Library and other apartments, and then entered the gardens, 
which were just beginning to assume their full summer beauty.
From the 
gardens the next place visited was the well-known Terrace-walk.
This point, 
on a fine day, commands a view of several miles of the valley of the Lowther, 
with the well-wooded scenery extending along the river, from Askham upwards 
in the one direction, and in the other past Whale and Helton, through the lower 
escarpment of the Mountain Limestone, out past Knipe Scar, to near Brampton, 
with the volcanic rocks of the Hawes Water- and Mardale-area, rising into 
mountain in the distance.
The Terrace itself, like many others in the same 
Park, consists of a natural platform of rock, resulting from the unequal power 
of resistance to mechanical erosion offered by one of the limestones of the 
Carboniferous Series as compared with the thin beds of sandstone and shale 
that come between them.
From the Terrace the party came back by way of the Conservatories, whence 
one section returned direct to Penrith, while the remainder drove to Brougham 
Castle, Here the chief objects of interest in connection with the Roman Camp 
and with the Castle itself were described by Dr. Taylor of Penrith.
The 
President also made some remarks upon the Countess of Pembroke and other 
persons connected with the Castle.
After Tea at the Mission Room, the members again gathered to hear the 
evening Lecture by Professor Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., on "Our Early Ances- 
tors in Britain.
" 
The second day's proceedings were commenced at 9-30 a.m. with a Council 
Meeting ; whereat several matters connected with the management of the 
Association were discussed.
At the General Meeting, which followed, the Reports were read and adopted, 
and the President, the Secretary, and the Editor were re-elected.
Then, on 
the motion of the Editor, the title of the Association was altered to that of the 
" Cumberland and Westmorland Association for the Advancement of Literature 
and Science." On the motion of Mr. Vivian, representing the Whitehaven' 
Society, the Rule VIII.
of former years was replaced by the Rule as it stands 
at present.
The reading of original papers was begim with Mr. Rawnsley's " Remi- 
niscences of Wordsworth gathered from the Peasantry," which the audience 
listened to with unmistakeable interest.
At the conclusion of the paper the 
President gave an account of his own recollections of Wordsworth.
This was 
followed by Mr. J.
D. Kendall's "History of Mining in Cumberland and 
Westmorland, " read in abstract by the Editor.
The President followed with 
a paper by Mr. T.
V. Holmes, which gave rise to some discussion.
At the 
close of the last paper, the time being far advanced, the Editor gave a brief 
outline of the contents of a paper by Mr. J.
C. Smith, on "The Rarer Plants 
around Penrith, " which was followed by a general account of the contents of 
each of the remaining papers down on the list to be read.
Then the meeting 
dispersed for Luncheon.
In the Afternoon the members drove out from Penrith to Pooley Bridge, 
whence they travelled by the steamer to Patterdale, Mr. Goodchild giving a series 
of short explanations of the principal features of geological interest at inteiTals 
throughout the journey.
At Patterdale such of the party as were not compelled 
to catch an early train remained a short time to enjoy the unrivalled combination 
of lake and mountain scenery around ; while'others returned by the next boat — 
and thus concluded a meeting that was in every respect one of the pleasantest 
yet held.

In presenting their Seventeenth Annual Report to the members 
of the Whitehaven Scientific Association, the Committee have to 
state that the affairs of the Association are in a satisfactory 
condition.
Membership.
Since the last report there has been a decrease in the number 
of members, owing to resignations, removals, and deaths.
Twelve 
new members were elected during the session, and there are now 
seventy-seven associate- and two hundred and twenty-five ordinary 
members on the books, making a total of three hundred and two.
Finances.
The finances of the Association are in a sound state.
The 
expenditure for the year, including the purchase of a handsome 
bookcase for the library, which, through the kindness of a member, 
the Committee were able to obtain on very favourable terms, has 
been more than covered by the income, and the debit balance has 
been reduced to ;^i8 19s.
2d.
Opening Meeting.
Owing to the difficulty in obtaining premises suitable for a 
conversazione, as in former years, the Committee altered the 
character of the opening meeting of the session.
The presidential 
address was given as usual, followed by a musical programme.
In consequence, probably, of this alteration, the attendance of 
members and their friends was not so large as on some former 
occasions, though the meeting was very successful.
Lectures.
Eleven lectures were given during the session, and with one or 
two exceptions were all well attended.
A special lecture to the 
colliers of Whitehaven and neighbourhood was also delivered 
under the auspices of the Association, and was much appreciated 
by a crowded audience.
The Committee desire to express their 
thanks to the gentlemen who so generously gave their services 
during the session.
Museum.
The Curator reports that the Museum has been enriched 
during the year by the following gifts :— Collection of foreign 
shells, Mr. J.
R. Wallace ; collection of foreign fish, Mr.
J. R.
Wallace ; minerals and Roman coin, Mr. J.
G. Dees ; 
Eledone cirrhosus, Mr. Waterfall ; Garfish, Mr. Levason ; skin of 
snake, a lady; Lump sucker, Mrs. Cowman ; Otter, Mr. A.
Moor- 
daff; tin and tin ores, Mr. J.

Dr. W.

Dr. W .
I'Anson ; model steam 
engine, Mr. John Peile, C.C, Cambridge.
To the donors of these 
presents the Committee wish to express their greatest obligations.
Library.
Since the last report eleven volumes of books have been acquired 
by purchase, and twenty-seven have been presented.
The thanks 
of the Committee are due to Messrs.
E. M.
Percy, G.
H. Parke, 
John Peile, J.
G. Dees, Vivian, and R.
Russell for these handsome 
gifts.
In order to render the library more useful to associate 
members, the Committee have arranged that in future books may 
obtained on application to the housekeeper, at any hour of the 
day, as well as on Tuesday nights from the librarian.
They trust 
that this plan will be approved, and the circulation of books 
increased.
It is proposed to issue a supplementary catalogue 
shortly.
Science Classes.
Science classes have been carried on during the session under 
the direction of Mr. A.
Freeman, and nineteen students are under 
instruction.
The results of the session's work will not be known 
until after the examinations in May. Tast year twenty-seven 
students presented themselves for examination.
Of these one 
passed first class ; seventeen second class ; and nine failed.
In concluding this report the Committee venture to express a 
hope that the advantages offered by the Association may meet with 
increasing appreciation on the part of the members.
The Com- 
mittee are anxious that the museum, library, lectures, and classes 
should become more useful as a means of intellectual improvement, 
and that the objects for which the Association was founded, namely 
the diffusion of scientific knowledge, should be kept steadily in 
view, as upon that its continued success mainly depends.

Your Committee have much pleasure in reporting the continued 
interest taken in the proceedings of the Society.
The attendance 
at both Papers and Lectures has been quite up to the average of 
previous years ; and the discussions after the papers have been 
more general.
The Treasurer of the Society reports that the income for the 
year ending March, 1884, was ^32 17s.
3d., and the expenditure 
_;^37 8s.
2d., leaving a balance against the Society of ^4 los.
iid.; 
the deficit being accounted for by the increased expenses of the 
public Lectures.
The total receipts of the Museum, inclusive of balance in hand 
(March, 1883,) of ;^-jS 9s.
6d., were ;!^ii8 14s.
6d.; and the 
expenditure ^34 3s.
jd.; leaving a balance in hand of 
_;^84 los.
I id.
The Hon. Curators report that some few additions have been 
made to the collections in the Museum, but that there is much 
yet to be done.
They suggest that some systematic effort might 
be made by those members who have leisure and opportunity for 
such work.
During last season the Museum was visited by six hundred and 
ninety-seven tourists, and one hundred and thirty-nine visits were 
made by members.
Professor Morris delivered an interesting lecture on Geology 
with reference to the Coal Measures of West Cumberland, illus- 
trating his lecture by specimens collated in the Museum.
Two Excursions were arranged.
The first, which took place in 
June, was to Thirlmere.
The members of the Wordsworth Society, 
Cockermouth, joined our party at Keswick.
After visiting the 
remains at Castle Crag, Launchy Gill, and other places of interest, 
tea was partaken of at Thirlspot.
Mr. W.
Wilson read an exhaus- 
tive paper on "Thirlmere and its Legends." 
The second Excursion was to the Shap Granite Quarries.
By 
kind permission of D.
Fenning.
Esq., the works and quarries were 
inspected, and Mr. J.
Postlethwaite, F.G.S., read an excellent 
paper on " Shap Granite." 
The Session of 1883-4 was opened by a Conversazione and Tea 
followed by the President's Address.
The expenses of tea, etc., 
were just met by the receipts.
Eight Papers and ten Lectures were arranged for, and all 
engagements were met, with one exception, and on that occasion 
the Rev. J.
N. Hoare, M.A., kindly offered his services.
The number of Members at the close of last Session was one 
. hundred and forty-five, and twenty-seven have been elected during 
the current session ; but thirty-two have either left the town or 
failed to keep up their membership, so that now there are one 
hundred and forty members.
The following are the Officers for 1884-5 • — President, Rev. W.

The Committee regret, in presenting their Eighth Annual Report, 
that although six new members joined the Society during the 
Session, yet there was a decrease of twenty-four compared with 
the previous year.
The membership now stands at one hundred, 
viz , sixty-nine gentlemen and thirty-one ladies.
The decrease in 
numbers is due to withdrawals and other undefined causes.
There were twelve Lectures given during the Session, of which 
three were delivered by gentlemen residing in the town ; and the 
warmest thanks of the Society are accorded to all those who took 
part in the programme.
Although the Lectures were more fully advertised than ever 
before, and the meetings were held in a room infinitely more 
comfortable and central than that in which the meetings were held 
previously, the attendance has not been very satisfactory.
It so 
happened that many of the nights on which lectures were given 
turned out to be very wet and boisterous, and thus the poor 
attendance on such nights might be accounted for.
The Treasurer's statement shows that, with the sale of gas-fittings 
in the George Street School Room, there is a credit balance of 
£Z 5s- od.

During the past year there has been a further decrease in mem-

from last year.
The receipts for the year, including a balance of 
7/1 brought from last year, amounted to ;^6 os.
iid.; expenditure, 
j[,6 IDS.
9d.; leaving a deficit of 9/10.
During the summer of 1883, Excursions were held under the 
auspices of the Society to Penton, and to Melrose, both of which 
were thoroughly enjoyed by those members who took part in 
them.
The Winter Programme was of a very instructive and interesting 
character, the only matter of regret being the small attendance at 
the Public Lectures.
The interest in the Ordinary Meetings was 
well sustained, and the attendance of members was fairly good.
On the evening of December 27th, in addition to the Musical 
Entertainment provided in the programme, a tea was given by the 
lady members, that evening being the occasion of the President — 
the Rev. Joseph Wallace — taking leave of the Society, on his 
preferment to the living of Hayton.
Another Tea Meeting was held at the close of the Session, 
after which a Musical Entertainment was given, and the following 
Officers elected : President — Rev. J.

During the season four Field-days have been held.
The first

Victoria Cave, on which occasion the members were joined by a 
large party from Penrith ; the second to Gilsland, June i8th, 1883; 
the third to Orton, near Carlisle ; and the fourth to Long Meg, 
accompanied by the members of the Penrith Society.
The attendance at the public Lectures was not so large as on 
former occasions ; but the attendance at the reading of Papers at

About one hundred and twenty copies 
of the Transactions have been gratuitously distributed among the 
members.

In reporting the close of the Fifth Session, the Committee, for 
various reasons, cannot class it as an altogether successful one.
The weather at almost every meeting, and particularly the first five 
or six, was exceptionally bad.
In consequence, the attendance 
this past winter has not been so good as in former sessions ; and 
the number of members is now reduced to sixty-two, being eight 
short of last year.
There were ten public Lectures given, and five ordinary meetings 
were held.
The financial position ot the Society is not what might be 
desired, but there is still a considerable sum in hand.
The following are the Officers for 1884-85 :— President — John 
Leitch, M.B., CM.

The Lectures this Session have been fourteen in number.
The 
average receipts at the lectures from non-members have been 15/1 
for eight lectures.
The most successful lecture financially was 
Dr. Hamilton's, producing ^i i8s.
3d.
The Society numbers seventy-two ordinary members, and twelve 
holders of family tickets, which have been estimated at two each, 
thus making the members amount to ninety-six.
The financial statement of the Treasurer shows that there has 
been received the sum of ^48 6s.
7|-d.; expended the sum of 
;^35 5s.

The thanks of the Society are due to those gentlemen who have 
so kindly given lectures during the past Session.
Your Committee deeply deplore the loss of one of their mem- 
bers — Mr. Ballantyne, who always took the liveliest interest in the 
affairs of the Society.
The Committee are glad to report generally the welfare and 
progress of the Society, and trust it may still meet with the support 
of the residents in the neighbourhood.
I 
§t\mi 0f the g^;si,$t»aati0w f emtavjj.
The past year has not been of a very eventful character as regards 
the Association, and no new Society has been affiliated with it.
The Workington Society, though still a member of the Union, 
has during the past year been in an unsatisfactory condition, 
and it is earnestly to be hoped that this once flourishing Society 
may, by local effort, be once more resuscitated.
Through this, 
[ and other reasons, the Association now numbers about 1217 
members, against 1380 in April last.
During the past year the Association has been affiliated with the 
British Association for the Advancement of Science, and there is 
reason to expect that the formal recognition for the first time by 
this great Association of the claims of Local Societies, may prove 
to be of considerable advantage to them, both by raising their 
status and increasing their means of usefulness.
(The subject will 
be found fully explained in the notice on p.
xxxiii.
of No. viii.) 
It is still a matter of regret that the affiliated Societies, as Avell 
as the people of Cumberland and Westmorland generally, do not 
take a larger number of copies of the Transactions.
The advantages 
of a publication of this kind should not require to be urged before 
members of the Association.
Favourable notices of the last 
volume have appeared in very many of the leading scientific and 
local journals, and it may fairly be asserted that the Association 
Transactions will, on the whole, bear comparison very favourably 
with those of most of the County Societies of England and Scot- 
land.
Copies of the Transactions of various Associations and local 
Societies are now being received in exchange for our own, and, in 
course of time, a Reference Library will be formed, which, it is 
hoped, may prove of considerable value to the members of the 
Association.

THE FORMATION OF THE ENGLISH PALATE.
By R.
S. FERGUSON, F.S.A.
(Presidential Address, delivered at the Penrith Annual Meeting.) 
The leai-ned and ingenious author of " The Romans of Britain," 
Mr. Coote, F.S.A., in a paper on The Cuisine Bottrgeoise of Ancient 
Rome* (which he communicated to the Society of Antiquaries) 
observed that " no one has yet written the history of the Roman 
palate, such as it became when the successes of that people had 
given occasion for its artificial cultivation." Mr. Coote's observa- 
tion may be widely extended : we have many recipe books, and 
many cookery books, but Ave have no general history of the palate, 
and no history of cookery considered as one of the fine arts.
Two 
books I may mention as exceptions, M.
Brillat-Savarin's Physiologic 
du Gout,\ and M.
Soyer's Pantropheon, or the History of Food and 
its Preparation from the Earliest Age of the World.
Mr. Coote 
well says, in allusion to the want of a history of the Roman palate, 
* ArchcEologia, vol.
41, pp.
283-324.
+ Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, judge of the Court of Cassation, member of the 
Legion of Honour, and of most of the scientific and literary societies of France, 
was born in 1755 at Belley.
The Physiologie dtc Gout was published some time 
in 1825, and ran rapidly through five or six editions, besides reprints in Belgium.
An English edition has just (1884) been published.
The late Mr. Hayward, 
Q.C., says of it, "Its great charm consists in the singular mixture of wit, 
humour, learning, and knowledge of the world — bons t?wts, anecdotes, ingenious 
theories, and instructive dissertations — which it presents.

Murray, London, 18S3, p.

du Gout.

" This is not merely an omission in archaeology, it is a blank left 
in the annals of taste." I would say more — the want of a general 
history of cookery, considered as one of the fine arts, is an omitted 
chapter in the history of civilization ; for cookery — good cookery 
— is one of the most important weapons by which civilization 
defeats the law of Natural Selection— under which, among the 
brutes, the sickly and the weakly die off, and the strong alone 
survive.
Far be it from me to rush into the gap — I do not know enough; 
long years of study would be necessary, nor am I vain enough to 
think my own palate sufficiently discriminating.
I can only give 
you to-night what I have culled from others — from Athenteus, 
from Apicius, from Pegge's Forme of Cury, from Mr. Coote's able 
article, from Alexander Dumas ( Dictionnaire de Cuisine), from 
Francatelli, and Soyer, and from accounts of ancient feasts and 
records of ancient housekeeping buried in the transactions of 
various archaeological societies.
I shall endeavour to give some idea of the art of cookery that 
at present prevails among us.
To begin with the earliest inhabitants of this country — the 
palaeolithic man, both river-drift, and cave — we need not linger 
over him : there can be no historical continuity between the 
traditions of his kitchen, and those of ours.
We do know some- 
thing of how the cave-man cooked — the Esquimaux remains to 
tell us : his food, if cooked at all (and by the way, raw meat is in 
high latitudes conducive to health), is broiled or boiled.
His 
vessels being of stone or wood, cannot be put on the fire ; but 
heated stones are dropped in, until the water becomes hot enough, 
and the meat is cooked.
The result is a mess of soot, dirt, and 
ashes, which, according to our notions, is intolerable ; but (as Sir 
John Lubbock says, and I am quoting him,) if the stench of an 
Esquimaux house does not take a man's appetite away, nothing 
else would be likely to do so.
But with the people the Romans found in this country we have 
a continuity, and it is worth while to enquire into what they had 
to cook, and how they cooked it.
From fragments which have come down to us, of the travels, in 
the 4th century before Christ, of Pytheas the celebrated mathema- 
tician, we learn that wheat was abundant in the southern districts 
of Britain, and that the inhabitants made a drink of wheat and 
honey, still known in some districts as " metheglin," and he is the 
first authority for the description of the British beer, against which 
the Greek physicians warned their patients "as a drink producing 
pain in the head, and injury to the nerves."* 
Caesar tells us somewhat more : in his account of Britain he 
distinguishes between the people dwelling on the coast, and those 
who inhabited the interior, the former being emigrants from 
Belgium ; of these he says that they cultivated the fields, and had 
a large number of cattle.
" Leporem et gallinam et anserem 
gustare, fas non putant : hgec tamen alunt, animi voluptatisque 
caussa."t Of the inhabitants of the interior he says, " Interiores 
plerique frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt."| Pre- 
historic archaeology has proved the truth of the statements 
made by Csesar.
In the kitchen-middens of this period we 
find the bones of the goat, the horned sheep, the small 
short horned ox, the horse, the swine, and the dog, though the 
last was probably only eaten under stress of famine.
Milk was 
probably a great staple of diet, and Canon Greenwell in this 
connection points out that at Grime's Graves, in Norfolk, where he 
excavated largely, a very large proportion of the numerous bones 
found were of the ox, and nearly all were of animals of but a few 
days old.
This he says, seems to imply that the milk was required 
by the owner of the cattle, who could not spare it to keep the 
calves alive.
Strabo expressly tells us the Britons had no cheese : 
the question is, had they any butter ?
It is nowhere mentioned 
that they had; if they had, it was probably churned in a skin, as the 
Arabs do to this day : hence it would be, like the Irish bog butter, 
full of hairs.
The terraces, on which the people we are speaking 
of, cultivated grain, have also been found, but we have stronger 
proof that they did cultivate grain in the numerous pestles, and 
* Elton's Origins of English History, chap, i .
t Comm.

% Ibid, c, 14.
mortars, and grain rubbers that are in our museums.
These 
articles also show that their owners made some sort of dish out of 
the grain, whether mere crowdy, or porridge, or even bread I 
cannot say ; but whatever it was, it was certainly full of sand and 
grits, as shown by the condition of their teeth, which, though often 
sound and strong, particularly among the older race, the longheads, 
are worn down to the very gum.
As for cooking utensils, their pottery was unglazed and porous : 
milk kept in it would soon be tainted, and as use is second nature, 
the earlier inhabitants of this country probably liked their milk 
"gamey," as do the inhabitants of the western isles of Scotland, 
where the "craggan" is still in use.
Such vessels were ill adapted 
for cooking purposes ; but in the later bronze period there were in 
Britain and in Ireland caldrons of thin plates of hammered bronze 
rivetted together, some of conical, others of spheroidal shape.
Whether there then were in the British Isles bronze smiths capable 
of making these vessels, or whether the vessels were imported, 
I cannot now stop to discuss : my object in mentioning them was 
merely to show that these vessels were in the hands of the Britons, 
and that they thus had the means of boiling their food over 
a fire.
But, though the inhabitants of Britain had, when Ccesar arrived 
here, pots of bronze in which to boil, and viands with which to fill 
those pots, they could have had no cookery worth the name.
They lacked two things essential in cookery : first of all they had 
no sugar : beet-root sugar and maple-sugar were not then invented, 
and cane-sugar was just known by travellers' tales to the Romans, who 
used honey, or sugar made from honey.
But the ancient Britons had 
not even this, for the late Professor Rolleston has shown that they had 
no domesticated bees, though they did make mead [metheglin] from 
the honeyof wild bees.
"Nowif we onlyconsider," says the Professor, 
"how largely separated sugars enter into the dietaries of the poorest 
amongst us, we shall be puzzled to understand how, in the days of 
Caractacus, people cooked at all without sugar."* I believe that in 
England every adult consumes weekly seven and a half ounces 
* British Barrows.
Greenwell and Rolleston, p.
725.
of sugar.
The other essential to cookery that the earlier inhabitants 
of Britain lacked was oil.
We unfortunately are obliged to use 
butter in our cookery instead of oil : the ancient Britons certainly 
had no oil, and they either had no butter at all, or else it was full 
of hairs, and probably rancid.
I am inclined to think that they, 
like more civilized countries, had no butter : according to Bishop 
Patrick, the Greeks had no butter in the fourth century before 
Christ ; neither Homer, Euripides, Hesiod, or Aristotle, ever 
mention butter, though they mention cheese.
It is to the Romans we must accredit the introduction of the 
art of cookery into these islands.
I hope to show you from whence the Romans got the art of 
cookery, and when : what their cookery was like, and the influence 
it has had upon the present state of the art in this country.
Like many other things, the art of cookery came from the East : 
the Romans got it from the Greeks, and the Greeks got it from 
the Lydians, whose cooks were highly celebrated.
Some archaeologists have speculated on the cookery of the ante- 
diluvians : as these persons were or ought to have been vegetarians, 
they probably cooked but little : the patriarchs seem to have been 
acquainted with roasting, boiling, and baking, and they knew how 
to make savoury meat with sauce, probably with oil, for though 
butter is mentioned in the Old Testament, cream is more likely 
meant.
Kids and lambs were their main meats : the common 
fowl was unknown to the patriarchs : indeed it is never mentioned 
by the writers of the Old Testament, nor by Homer or Hesiod.
It was a later introduction, and found its way from India to Rome 
vid the Red Sea, or far more probably by Babylon.
It is impossible to majce a continuous history of the art of 
cookery from the times of the patriarchs downwards : we have to 
skip, and we pick up our thread again with the Lydians.
Lydia 
was a district of Asia Minor, and was a very early seat of Asiatic 
civilization : from the Lydians the Greeks derived many civilized 
arts, such as the weaving and dying of fine fabrics : various pro- 
cesses of metallurgy : the use of gold and silver money, various 
6 
metrical and musical improvements (particularly the musical scale), 
and the art of cookery.
VVe are now beginning to get upon the safe ground of a book on 
the subject, the Aenrvo(ro<f>ia-Tal, (Deipnosophistae), or T/ie Banquet 
of the Learned, by Athenaeus the grammarian.
This book is a 
collection of ana, or anecdotes, on all sorts of things, particularly 
Gastronomy, and is put fortli by Athenseus as a full account of 
the conversation at a banquet at Rome, at which he, Galen the 
physician, and Ulpian the jurist were among the guests.
Only a 
fragment of the book has come down to us : it is our authority for 
the high fame to which the Lydian cooks had attained.
Athengeus 
also preserves for us the names of several writers on cookery, 
whose works, alas !
are lost : he enumerates some seventeen, and 
these seventeen are not retired hotel-keepers, club-cooks, or old 
ladies, but doctors — doctors of high degree, such as Erasistratus 
of Ceos, the most famous anatomist and vivisectionist of his day, 
a physician second only to Hippocrates.
Heraclides, who wrote 
on Materia Medica, and also wrote a commentary on Hippocrates; 
Criton of Rome, and Diodes of Eubsea, both distinguished medical 
writers.
Don't let any one be surprised : in both classical and 
mediaeval times, the arts of cookery and of healing were always 
considered closely allied.
The word curare signifies equally to 
dress victuals and to cure a distemper.
There is a well known 
Latin adage — 
Culina medicines famulatrix, 
and another 
Explicit coqtiina que est optima medicina.
The connection continued to the end of the 17th century.
In 
1684 one Hartman a chemist published in one volume, "A choice 
collection of Select Remedies for all Distempers incident to Men 
Women, and Children, together with excellent Directions for 
Cookery, and also for preserving and conserving." The association 
of ideas still obtains at sea, and sailors always call their cook the 
doctor.
Not even fragments of the culinary works of these writers have 
come down to us, though some of their medical works have, and 
thus we are in darkness as to the Lydian and Greek art of 
Cookerjr, except so far as we learn it from Apicius, a book which I 
shall presently say a good deal about.
But that among the Greeks 
the Art was highly thought of, we know from a quotation from a 
play of Euphron, preserved in Athenseus—

The Romans at first were far from holding cooks in such honour: 
a military and an agricultural people, their original cookery was a 
very simple affair ; it was very vegetarian.
Pliny describes an old 
fashioned Roman dinner zs~LactuccB singuh^, cochlem terncB, ova 
bma, altca cum mulso et nive, olivce Bistica;, cucurbitcB, bulbi, alia 
milk non minus lauta.
This peculiarity of being very vegetarian 
adheres to this day to the cookery of all the Latin races, and is 
(says Mr. Coote) in itself an evidence of much refinement.
The great national dish of the primitive Roman was/w/r.- it 
was a sort of gruel, pap, or pottage made of alica (wheat grits) or 
of simila (semolina), flavoured with herbs, or brains.
Sometimes it 
was merely milk and biscuit boiled together : a similar dish was 
ptisana, made from barley grits, and was a barley water flavoured 
with herbs, vinegar, oil, and wine.
The Roman had also a great 
weakness for sausages and smoked meats [Lucanica, botelli, farci- 
mina\ Upon this simple style of cooking, the Greek art was 
engrafted, and the rich, invigorating Asiatic-Greek sauces warmed 
up the simple Roman fare into life and energy.
We learn the date of this change from Livy, lib.
xxxix c.
6. 
Writing of the effects of the victories in the year 189 B.C. of Cnceus 
Manlius Vulso in Asia, he says : LuxuricB mim peregrine origo ab 
exercitu Asiatico inveda in urbem est.
After enumerating several 
instances, he says, "^/afe quoque ipsoe et cura et sumptu majore 
appararicoeptcz: turn coquus, vitissimum antiquis mancipium, et asti- 
matione et usu, m pretio esse; et, quod ministerium fuerat, ars haberi 
coeptaP Lucullus, also, after his victories over Mithridates and 
Tigranes, did a great deal to introduce sumptuous living into Rome.
He had amassed vast treasures in Asia, and was thus able to gratify 
8 
his taste for luxury and magnificence.
The Romans threw all 
their strong nature into the new art : they became dinner givers 
and diners out ; ransacked their most distant provinces for new 
luxuries ; they discovered and imported the pheasant, the wood- 
cock, and the guinea-fowl.
Fame was to be attained by the 
successful culture of some new viand for the table : and Columella 
in his De Re Rustica, tells us that Sergius Orata, i.e. Sergius the 
gold brasse (a small fish), and Licinius Murena, i.e. Licinius the 
sea eel, derived their names from the successful cultivation of those 
fish for the table.
Of course there was a re-action.
As Mr. Coote says, "ideas of 
such novelty taken second-hand from the lively and luxurious 
Greek, aroused what still remained of the stern and puritanical 
character of the Romans." Sumptuary laws were enacted : no one 
was allowed to have more than three guests to dinner : dormice, 
and shellfish, and strange birds brought from foreign countries 
(the pheasant, woodcock, and guinea-fowl,) were prohibited." "No 
success," says Mr. Coote, "could wait on such grim essays at 
retrogression.
They accordingly proved failures, and the efforts 
of sumptuary laws and censors could not drive the Roman genilc- 
man back into the plain cookery of his ancestors." 
Now there has come down to us a Book, which reveals to us 
the taste of the Roman palate — and the dishes of this Asiatico- 
Greeko-Romano-art which pleased it.
It is a book whose name 
sounds familiar to most people, but which few, even among 
scholars, have ever seen.
It rarely occurs even in the best 
libraries.
No translation exists: the production of one would 
puzzle the best scholars of the day, who are not as a rule familiar 
with the terms of art of the Roman or English kitchen.
But SmoUet had read Apicius, and understood it too, and he 
had read the commentators, Humelbergius and Lister, and the 
famous " Dinner in the Manner of the Ancients," in Peregrine 
Pickle, is the work of a scholar in culinary matters.
The title of the work is — Apicii Coelii de Opsoniis et Condimentis 
sive Arte Coqiiinaria Libri Decern.
" The ten books of Apicius 
Coelius upon Viands and Sauces, or The Art of Cookery." 
Now Apicius did not write the book : he was no more a cook 
than I am : he was a famous bo7i vivant and gour?net, who flourished 
under the Emperor Tiberius, and whose name has passed into a 
proverb in all matters connected with the pleasures of the table.
The dull idiot who wrote the account of him in the Classical 
Dictionary calls him a gluifofi, and a more stupid libel was never 
penned, and that upon one whom all writers, from Juvenal and 
Martial downwards, have agreed to take as the representative of 
the haute cuisine of ancient Rome ; upon one who, as Pliny tells 
us, was the first to introduce to public notice cytnce et coliculi, in 
other words Brussels sprouts, a dish which charmed the Emperor 
Tiberius, though it shocked the rigid principle of the virtuous 
Drusus.
The name of the compiler is unknown.
Mr. Coote pleasantly 
conjectures him to have been the Soyer or Francatelli of the 
period, who prefixed the name of Apicius to his book by way of a 
good advertisement.
Many of the dishes owe their nomenclature 
to historical personages, and by these names Mr. Coote is able to 
show that the book contains recipes ranging from the time of the 
Republic to the Emperor Heliogabalus ; but the book is the 
composition of one writer, as shown by its cross references.
Mr.
Coote remarks " In its literal style it resembles Mrs. Glasse, in her 
pleasant pleonasms and sagacious comments." For convenience 
I shall the book by the name on its title page, Apicius, and the 
school of cookery it teaches the Apician.
There have been several editions of this Roman cookery book, 
but I need not trouble you about them.
The best is that of 1705, 
edited by Dr. Martin Lister, "e Medicis Domesticis serenissimse 
Reginae Annje." Of this only one hundred and twenty copies 
were printed, at the expense, as recorded on the back of the 
title page, of eighteen gentlemen, among whom were the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of Norwich, and of Bath and 
Wells ; the Earls of Sunderland and Roxburgh ; Sir Robert 
Harley, Sir Christopher Wren, Isaac Newton, Flamstead the 
Astronomer-Royal, Hans Sloane, etc.
Since this publication 
the book has fallen almost entirely into oblivion, and the learned 
10 
editor has been forgotten ; but in his day he was a well known 
London celebrity.
I must proceed to make some pickings from it.
The Roman batierie de aiisine much resembles ours, ours indeed 
being descended it from it.
Although we may have new inventions, 
I doubt if we have anything better : indeed Dr. Bruce told me that 
the Duke of Northumberland's French chef\iz.^ had reproduced for 
his own use some of the Roman cooking implements in the Duke's 
museum at Alnwick.
Large collections of them are in the museums 
at Herculaneum and Pompeii.
Their usual material is bronze 
tinned, but silver was frequently used.
The Romans had the 
spit iveru), the gridiron (craticula), and the frying-pan {sartagd).
They had saucepans of every size, cacalms, cacabidus, zetna, angu- 
laris,pultarinm.
The Roman saucepan differed in shape somewhat 
from ours : ours broaden to their base ; the Roman narrowed like 
a tea-cup ; and had a long flat side handle terminating in a circular 
expansion at the end, in which was a hole, so that the pan could 
be hung up by its handle.
It has been objected that the Roman 
shape would upset very easily on a fire : so it would, on an open 
coal fire, but the Roman mainly cooked with charcoal, and to a 
great extent on stoves.
Their saucepans seem to have been made 
in sets of five, each being, in capacity, a regular multiple of five 
cyathi,\hQ cyathvs being a Roman measure equal to -08 of our 
pint.
A set preserved at Castle Howard hold each ten, fifteen, 
twenty-five, fifty, and sixty cyaihi, and the smallest would hold 
four-fifths of a pint of our measure.
There was the stewpan of 
hronzt, paiina, patella, and of earthenware, cumana; the braizing 
pan (thermospodion), the oven ffurnus), the Dutch oven (clibatiusj, 
the bain 7narie pan {duplex vas).
A net {reticuliis), or a basket 
{sportella), was sometimes used in boiling : they had steaming 
apparatus, strainers, skimmers, drying cloths, moulds, etc., mortars, 
pestles, hand mills, etc.
The mortars {mortaria) are the best 
known of the Roman kitchen utensils to us : fragments of them 
turn up everywhere.
They were usually made of yellow, drab, 
or fawn-coloured clay, sometimes of Samian ware, and the surface 
of the interior is often studded with small siliceous stones, broken 
11 
quartz, and scoria of iron, to help attrition.
When we come to 
understand the character of Roman cookery, we shall see why the 
remains of mortaria are so common.
We now come to a most important matter; the consideration of 
the Roman sauces as given in the pages of Apicius.
On sauces 
Mr. Coote remarks, "As sauces are the demonstrations of cookery 
as a fine art, so they are the measure and gauge of its excellence." 
In fact the excellence of any particular school of cookery is to be 
measured by the excellence of its sauces.
The general sauces of English cookery are formed of meat 
gravy with the flavouring of onion, spices, and fines herbes, the 
whole being inspirited by the addition of wine.
To this conjunction 
is added ketchup, rarely anchovy ; and where it is required the 
sauces are thickened by flour or arrowroot.
The Roman sauces 
are the same in principle, and, with some exceptions, nearly the 
same in fact.
The Roman cooks used honey for perfecting these 
sauces, where we now use sugar — cane, beet, or maple.
Cane 
sugar was only just known to them by travellers' tales ; beet and 
maple were not invented.
But you must not imagine the Roman 
cooks used honey in the state we eat it at breakfast : it would be 
clarified, and manufactured, and the product (the dere honey of 
mediaeval cooks,) clarified by the whites of eggs and other means, 
would not be unlike our sugar.
In fact honey, as we use it, would 
bear about the same relation to it as used by the Roman cooks 
that the raw sugar-cane juice does to manufactured white sugar.
Again, the Roman cooks used oil, where we use butter, "barbarian 
butter " Mr. Coote calls it, and there can be no doubt that in 
cookery oil is infinitely superior to butter.
But it is essential that 
the oil should be fresh and good, and it is very difiicult indeed in 
this country to get.
Instead of meat essence, which our cooks use largely, the 
Romans used wine, and various decoctions of wine, as we English 
did in mediaeval times, viz.
merum, defrtitum, carcenum, mulsum, 
passum, all of which, except the first, were wines boiled down in 
different degrees, sometimes with honey.
The Romans used herbes potageres very largely.
I give you a 
12 
list of their English names ; 
you 
will recognise them all as old 
English pot-herbs, used in English cookery.
In fact most of them 
were brought here by the Romans.

were all used in the making of sauces.
Of spices they had plenty : pepper, long and short, ginger, malo- 
bathrum, cassium, folium, costus, spikenard — all from the East.
Then 
they had another spice a host in itself, si/p/iium, laser, or laserpitium, 
used in root, leaf, and in juice.
This was once the staple product 
of Cyrene, and sold almost for its weight in silver.
It is now lost; 
we don't know what it was : the coins of Cyrene show it to have 
been an umbelliferous plant : assafastida has been suggested, and 
Smollett adopts this notion, and introduces at the " Dinner in the 
Manner of the Ancients," a jelly of vinegar, pickle, and honey 
boiled together, and garnished with candied assafaetida.
But 
Humelbergius and Dr. Lister strongly oppose this view.
Assafsetida 
is even now used in cookery by modern arabs.
Cinnamon the Romans did not use, except on the funeral pyre.
But with that exception, and the exception of lemon juice, almost 
all things that offered zest, that insured flavour, that assisted 
appetite, and promoted digestion, were imported by the Roman 
into sauce and stew.
There was a something else, with which Roman cooks tempered 
u 
all their sauces and all their dishes, namely gariim or liquamen.
It was a sauce made from the intestines and heads of large fish — 
the tunny, the sturgeon, the mackerel : these were mixed in a vat 
with salt, and were exposed to the sun for a long time : wine was 
added, and pot herbs.
The art is now completely lost : and we 
do not know what was this garuin or liquamen which was so dear 
to the Roman palate.
Where it was used, salt was never used, 
and therefore garum must have had a salt flavour ; yet it was bad, 
if it was too salt, and honey then was added to it ; salt fish were 
washed in it, to take away their saltness.
On the whole one is 
inclinM to think that garum was a thin sauce with a delicate salt 
flavour, a nuance, says Mr. Coote, "a soiipgon which recalled to the 
jaded Roman the healthy ozonic air of the fresh and tone-giving 
seas of Baise and Tarentum." Smollet substitutes herring pickle 
for it.
To go back to sauces in general : the gravy of the object for 
which the sauce was intended, was also mixed with the sauce.
Starch, bread, and wafer biscuits were used for thickening sauces, 
also eggs, cooked or raw.
So much for the Roman sauces.
I next come to the various 
dishes to which the Roman cooks served these sauces.
We shall 
find that they had almost every dish that we have, and a great 
many that we now reject.
We make great use of beef and 
mutton, which they did not : beef is little used in hot countries.
The Romans, however, used veal ; mutton they cared little for 
except wild ; but lamb was a staple dish, and so was pork — for 
which they had a complete passion : their pork, fed on figs or 
chesnuts, was probably as much superior to our pork, as our beef 
and mutton would be to theirs.
To take their dishes in a regular order, I will begin with fish.
This they cooked in every way that we do : they boiled, stewed, 
baked, and broiled : they stuffed with various ingredients, and 
they made rissoles of it.
It is an historical fact, recorded in the 
life of the Emperor Heliogabalus, that that magnificent sensualist 
was the first inventor of lobster rissoles, which by the way the 
Roman cooks made in a shape and baked ; our cooks fry them.
15 
Here is a recipe for lobster rissoles from Apicius : — "Isicia de 
lolig'mc.
Sublatis crinibus in puhnentiivi tutides, sicut assolet pulpa: 
et in mortar io et in liquamine diligenter fricatur : et exinde isicia 
plassantur." Take oft the spawn first, boil the lobster, then chop 
it into a fine pulp; pound in a mortar with eggs, pepper, and 
garum, and then set in a shape, and bake.
The Roman cooks made isicia of several sorts : of lobster, and also 
of the sepia or cuttle-fish, and of various meats ; their isicia answer 
to our rissoles, croquettes, quenelles, kromeskys, and forcemeats.
The usual Roman materials for quenelles were pheasant, peacock, 
rabbit, chicken, or sucking-pig, pounded in a mortar, and then 
simmered in sauces, to which pepper, gariim and wine with other 
flavouring ingredients were generally added.
To return to fish : fish stews were much in vogue.
Here is a 
recipe.
Pisces qualeslibet rades et curaios mittes, cepas siccas 
Ascalonias, vet alterius getieris concides in patinam, et pisces super 
compones : adjicies liquamen, oleum; cum coctum fuerit, salsum 
coctum in medio pones, addeiiduin acetiim.
Scrape any sort of fish ; 
cut up dry chalots, or any other kind of onion, and put them into 
a stew pan; lay the fish upon them, add thereto ^arz/w and oil 
and cook.
When they are done, put some cooked salsum (some 
salt relish, like caviare,) in the midst of them : add vinegar, and 
serve.
Here is a recipe for sauce for fried fish : — Fiscem, quemlibet 
cures, salias, friges : prepare any sort of fish, sprinkle salt, and fry.
Then for the sauce : Teres piper, ciiminum, coriandri semen, laceris 
radicetn, origanum, rutam fricabis ; suffundes acetutn ; adjicies 
caryotam, mel, defrutum, oleum ; liquamine temperabis, refundes in 
cacabum; facias ut ferveat : cumferbuerit piscem frictum perfundes, 
piper asperges et inferes.
Pound pepper, cummin, coriander seed, 
laser root, marjoram, and rue ; pour in vinegar, add a date, honey, 
defrutum (i.e. preparation of wine,) oil; temper with garum; 
pour it into a saucepan, make hot ; when hot, pour over the fried 
fish, pepper it, and serve.
Coming to their meats — beef and mutton they neglected, for 
reasons I have mentioned already.
But copadia, stews of Iamb, 
16 
were very popular.
Stew in gariim and pepper, with French 
beans, and add a sauce of garum, pepper, laser root, and ground 
cummin seed ; add sippets of bread, and oil.
There were several 
other recipes for lamb stew.
Kid was treated in the same way as 
lamb.
The wild sheep, or raouflon of Sardinia, was a favourite 
dish.
For venison they had many sauces, and honey forms an 
ingredient of the venison and wild sheep sauces, an ingredient for 
which we now-a-days substitute current jelly.
Hare was another 
popular dish : they stuffed it with pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, 
peppercorns, its own liver and lights chopped up, and eggs.
They 
baked it, boiled it, roasted it, stewed it, and jugged in many ways 
and with many sauces.
The shoulder-blade was the tit-bit.
But far above all other dishes did the Roman value pork.
And 
no wonder ; his pigs were fattened upon figs, and died of apoplexy 
brought on by the sudden administration of a doze of honey and 
wine.
Mr. Coote observes that this "is the nearest approach 
ever made in sober fact to dying of a rose in aromatic pain." It 
reminds of the story of the Duke of Clarence and the butt of 
Malmsey.
Pliny tells us that pork was the most lucrative dish they had at 
the cook shops, and that they could give it nearly fifty flavours ; 
by the time of the Emperor Heliogabalus additional ones had 
been invented, and Apicius gives over eighty recipes for cooking 
pork.
They roasted it, broiled it, fried it, baked it, boiled it, and 
stewed it ; they cut it up into all sorts of dishes ; they cooked 
sucking pig in sixteen different ways ; they did the kidneys in 
methods that would charm the Cambridge undergraduate ; they 
made haggis of pork, and here we trace the national dish of Scot- 
land, as we do its national music, to the Romans : but the Romans 
made the haggis of pork, the Scots make it of mutton.
The 
recipe is too long to quote.
With regard to birds and fowls, the Romans were omnivorous : 
they ate oinnitnoda volatilla, everything that flies; so did our 
mediaeval ancestors.
The swan and peacock, which we now see 
alone at city and college feasts, are survivals.
But Lord William 
Howard, as his household books show, ate cormorants, and cranes, 
17 
and herons.
The Romans roasted, boiled, and stewed their fowls, 
but stewing was the method most in vogue : perhaps because they 
could so best disguise the strong flavour of a cormorant or a stork.
They generally gave their birds a preparatory boil before they 
plucked and cleansed them ; or sometimes they steamed them 
first.
I have already spoken of one main branch of the Roman dishes, 
the isicia, our rissoles, quenelles, croquettes, kromeskys, etc.
I 
will now call your attention to the patina, the minutal, and the 
salacacabla.
I have already given an instance of a patina or stew 
of fish.
Patincs or stews of vegetables were made of pounded 
vegetables, such as asparagus, mixed with eggs, and sometimes 
with milk, but always with eggs.
Honey, pepper, garum, oil, and 
other ingredients were added.
The patincs of fruit answer to our 
compote of fruit, but we do not now-a-days flavour quinces with 
leeks, or pears with anchovy sauces.
The patincs were elaborate 
stews, which survived in mediaeval cookery, and are now gone out.
The minutal was a mess of chopped or minced fish or meat, 
without either milk or eggs, but bread or biscuit was always an 
ingredient.
The salacacabla was a similar dish, in which bread 
and cheese was an essential : it was always set by the application 
of cold.
These two dishes, like the patina, died out in mediaeval 
times : they were too much of a mixture, not to say mess, for 
modern stomachs.
The Patina Apiciana was a mixture of pounded 
pork, fish, chicken, becaficoes, fieldfares, and qvxacunqat optima 
fuerunt, pounded and chopped with pepper, lovage, garum, 
wine, pas urn, pine nuts — a regular Salmigondis.
A fair idea 
of a salacacabla may be got from "Peregrine Pickle," where 
one is described as consisting of parsley, pennyroyal, cheese, 
pine tops, honey, vinegar, brine, eggs, cucumbers, onions, and 
hen livers, all macerated and pounded up in a mortar, and after- 
wards set by the application of snow.
Of pastry the Romans made little use, except for pies.
They 
made meat pies, and ham pies, and chicken pies — pies of all sorts 
of fowl, even of storks and herons.
Their paste was made ex farina 
oleo subacta, that is of flour and oil.
2 
18 
The Romans had almost all the vegetables we have, except the 
potato and tomatoe, and they both boiled and stewed them.
Raw salads were in vogue ; but, like the modern Italian, they 
also affected them boiled.
Of sweets the Romans had numerous dishes ; and among the 
recipes given by Apicius may be found ones for custard, and for 
omelettes, and cheese cakes.
Snails they fried and sauced in various ways ; eggs they fried 
and boiled, and served with sauces.
From what I have already said, I think you will have perceived 
that the differences between the Roman and the English styles of 
cookery are differences only of detail, not of principle.
Mr. Coote 
sums up : — They cooked their fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetables in 
manners more or less identical with ours ; their sweets present less 
similarity, but there are resemblances even in them.
Their pot 
herbs are all in use at the present day, except laser, which has not 
been rejected by us, but is lost, or unrecognised at the present 
time.
But a perusal of Apicius shows that Roman cookery was 
intended for stomachs weakened by luxury ; the rationale of the 
Roman saiaces was to promote digestion by raising the tone of the 
stomach : thus strong and warming condiments were unsparingly 
used, such as carraway, anise, cummin, celery seeds ; also pine 
nuts, juniper, laurel, and lentise berries.
Mustard, strange to say, 
they used very timidly : only in boils and stews, never with roasts 
and broils.
Pepper they used to everything — fish, flesh, and fruit.
It was first introduced into Rome in the time of Pliny, and its 
brusque and fiery taste startled the senses of the bon vivants of the 
city.
Pliny was of that number : Usum ejus acleo plncuisne mirum 
est : in aliis quippe suavitas r.epit, in aliis species invitavii.
Huic 
nee pomi nee baccce commendatio est aliqua.
^ola placere amari- 
tudine, et hanc in Indos peti.
Quis ille qui primus cibis experiri 
voluit.
In fact pepper was a new sensation, when first introduced 
into Europe, and the Romans fell in love with it.
It did not 
supersede, however, the rue and lovage they previously used to 
produce similar effects.
They used all three.
But we cannot really solve the question of what Roman coofcery 
19 
was like ffisthetically, until we can find out exactly what was the 
garum with which they seasoned everything.
Dumas calls it '*ce^ 
horrible melange," and certainly a composition of fish offal, salt, 
wine, and pot herbs, exposed to putrify in the sun, does not sound 
nice to our ideas ; nor can we understand how garum came to be 
mingled in all sauces, simple or compound, and to be applied 
alike to the seasonings of fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetable.
I have already pointed out that the Roman cookery was destined 
for stomachs weakened by luxury.
It further violated one great 
gastronomical law.
The savours of their rich sauces preponderated 
over the savour of the viands.
The Roman cooks were proud of 
this.
Apicius, after giving a recipe for cooking and saucing a fish, 
proudly says.
Nemo agnoscet quid manducet.
As Mr. Coote says : 
"This is itself a great divergence from the principles of true taste.
We know that an object should be relieved by its sauce, not 
dominated and overpowered.
And in the case of the Romans 
this faulty canon led to a further and greater error.
The same 
sauces were poured over roast, boiled, broiled, and baked, without 
choice or discrimination." 
I am sorry to say that the Americans are falling into this error; 
even in the best American hotels, whatever dish you are served 
with, the sauce is the same.
People in Carlisle sometimes fall 
into the first error, and I have known a fresh run Eden salmon 
served up with lobster sauce, to its utter overpowering, instead of 
parsley, or, better still, fennel.
The Apician cookery sinned further against the canons of good 
taste, and that was in the excessive pounding and mincing to which 
it subjected its viands.
Seneca in one of his epistles says : 
'* Expecto jam ut manducata ponantur." 
To sum up the differences between the Roman cookery and that 
of the present day : they used wine in sauces, where we use meat gravy.
This a startling discrepancy, but it was done in English cookery in 
mediaeval times.
They used oil, where we use butter ; they used 
honey — clarified honey, where we use sugar.
We go in for joints 
— beef and mutton, more than they did ; we use salt almost 
universally, though not so universally as they used garum ; we use 
mustard more than they did ; we use lemon juice, which they 
rejected ; we still use the Roman pot herbs, but we content our- 
selves with two or three in a sauce, instead of ten or a dozen.
Our palate, chaster than that of jaded and luxurious Rome, has 
rejected the more complicated stews and ragouts of ancient Rome, 
the patina, the minutal, the salacacabia ; but we have invented 
nothing new.
The cold waters of our Northern seas give finer 
fish than the Romans ever knew ; we have drawn the turtle from 
the West Indies, and mulligatawney and curry from the East, but 
we have invented no new conceptions since the rissoles of Helio- 
gabalus.
The Roman cook, who knew his Apicius, would be 
capable of cooking for a city company of the present day, or of 
fulfilling an engagement as chef to the Reform club.
In cookery 
alone, of all tnings human, human nature seems to rest and be 
thankful.
Before leaving this branch of my subject, I will try to give you 
some idea of a Roman dinner, by setting before you a menu* for 
sixteen persons, of a dinner given about the middle of the period 
of the Republic, and therefore before luxury had attained the 
height it reached in the times of the Empire.
For a preliminary whet or ante ccenam, there were all sorts of 
shell fish, such as sea urchins, raw oysters unlimited, fieldfares, 
and asparagus (echinos, ostreas crudas, quantum vdlent, pdoridas, 
sphondilos, turduvi^ asparagos).
Shell fish were considered a great 
luxury by the Romans, and the Mediterranean furnishes a large 
variety.
The grape-fed fieldfare was also a great luxury, and a 
corona of roast fieldfares was placed round another dish, in this 
case probably round the asparagus, as a garnish.
Next comes the first course proper : gallinam altilem, patinatn 
ostreorum, peforidvm, balanos nigros, bnJanos a^bos : that is — fat 
fowls, stewed oysters, stewed muscles, and balani, both black and 
white.
Balani may be acorns, chesnuts, or dates, or sea-fish — 
I don't know which.
For the second course: sphondihs, gh/comaridas, urticas, 
fideculas, lumbos caprugineos, aprugnos, altilia ex farina involuta, 
* The Cana Mddli, Macrobius, ii.
9. 
31 
fideculas, munces et purpuras : that is — more shell-fish, including 
the purple murex, becaficos (the fig-picker), cutlets of wild goat 
and of wild boar ; chicken pies, snipes.
For the last course : sumina, sinciput aprugnum, patinam 
pincium, patinam suminis, anates, quercedulas elixas, lepores, altilia 
assa, amylum, panes Picentes : that is — sows'-hearts, wild boar's 
head, stewed fish, stewed sows'-hearts, ducks, some some small 
birds boiled (I don't know what quercedula are: some bird that 
feeds on acorns), hares, roast fowls, bread sauce, sponge cakes.
A dessert would follow.
This is the menu of a very simple 
dinner indeed : it was at a later period we come to the dormice fed 
on chesnuts, served with sweet sauce on golden plates, and the 
elaborate ^Mtinas and salacacabias of the Apician cookery.
Such was the Roman cookery.
It had a very long term of 
existence : it did not expire with the Empire, but survived even 
through the middle ages.
The Romans brought it to this country; 
we have every right to believe that it continued after they left.
The .Anglo-Saxon in his cookery used the mortar extensively, and 
he used the word briw, for an elaborate stew.
But however that 
may be, the Anglo-Norman cookery is a legitimate descendant of 
the Apician.
The Normans liked high-seasoned dishes : William 
of Malmesbury tells us incidentally that a great prince ate garlick 
with a goose, from which we are led to suppose that the Normans 
had the Roman taste for highly seasoned dishes.
Necham tells 
us that fish should be cooked in a sauce composed of wine and 
water, and should be served with a sauce of sage, parsley, cost, 
thyme, ditany, and garlick.
That is a thoroughly Apician recipe.
For the Anglo-Norman cookery of the 14th century we have a 
cookery book to go to.
" The Forme of Cury, a Roll of Ancient 
English Cookery, compiled about A.D. 1390, by the Master Cooks 
of King Richard II." This is a vellum roll, containing one 
hundred and ninety-six formute, or recipes.
A memorandum 
upon it in Latin states that it was presented to Queen Elizabeth, 
as "Antiquicin hoc inontmientuiib," by E.
Stafford.
Hceres domus 
suhversce Buckiiighamice.
He was grandson of the Duke of 
Buckingham, who was beheaded in 152 1.
This roll was published 
32 
in 1780, by the well known antiquary, Dr. Samuel Pegge, a scholar 
to whom no branch of archaeology was unfamiliar.
The Arc/iceoloi^ia 
contains pape s by him on every possible subject — coins, gla^s 
windows, cockfighting, bull-running, horse shoeing, charter horns, 
prehistoric implements, etc.
Whatever subject was broached at 
the meetings of the Society of Antiquaries, Dr. Samuel Pegge was 
ready with appropriate and learned observations.
The preamble of the roll states that this "forme of cury was 
com|)iled of the chef Maister Cokes of Kyng Richard the Secunde, 
Kyng of England after the Conquest, ye which was accounted ye 
best and ryallest viander of all christian kings, and it was 
compiled by assent and asysement of Maisters of Phisik and of 
Philosophie thatdwellid in his court.
First it techith a man for to 
make comune pottages and comune meetis for household as they 
should be made craftly and holsomly.
Afterward it techitt for to 
make curious pottages and meetis and sotillees for alle mane of 
of States bothe hye ami lowe.
And the techyng of the forme of 
making of pottages and of meetis bothe of flesh and of fissh, both 
sette here by noumbre and by order.
Sso this little table here 
servyng wole teche a man withoute taryyng to fynde what meet 
that hym lust for to have." 
With the " Forme of Cury" is also published another contem- 
poraneous manuscript.
The technical terms of the Apician 
cookery are puzzling enough to understand ; but the terms used 
in the "Forme of Cury," though it is written in English, are worse: 
even the learned and ingenious Dr. Pegge confesses that they 
have occasioned him great perplexity.
He says, " The names of 
the dishes and sauces .
. are not only many in number, but 
are often so horrid and barbarous, to our ears at least, as to be 
inveloped in several instances in almost impenetrable obscurity.
Brewet, and mortrew, payne fondewe, /arced grewel, sound almost 
meaningless to us ; even the simplest ingredients, such as eggs, 
are disguised under the term "eyren" and "ayren;" the en, being 
the old English plural, and the ey or ay, the same word that we 
have in the cits, so well known to oarsmen on the Thames, where 
the swans lay their eggs or " eyren." 
23 
The dishes in the " Forme of Ciiry" and the contemporaneous 
manuscript are chiefly soups, potages, ragouts, hashes, and the 
like hotch-potches : entire joints of meat being never served, and 
animals, whether fish or fowl, seldom brought to table whole, Lut 
hacked and hewed, and cut in pieces or gobbets.
The mortar also 
was in great request, some dishes being actually denominated from 
it, as mortrews or niorterelys.
From this you will see that the 
cookery of the " Forme of Cury" is Roman in character.
Close 
investigation shows that the ^^brewet" is the "patina," the 
"mortreto" the "minutal," the ^' payne fotulewe" the "salacacabia" 
and the ^'farced greiuels' the ' ^puls' of the Romans.
I will give 
one very simple recipe, that for a ^'viortrew" of a simple character: 
"boiled hens, crummed bread, yolk of eggs, and saffron, all 
pounded together in a mortar:" an Apician "minutal." 
We find also in the "Forme of Cury" other distinct Roman 
traits : olive oil and lard (or white grease) are generally used in the 
sauces, butter rarely.
Sugar is just beginning to supersede ' cle:e 
honey," that is honey refined with the white of eggs.
Wines, both 
red and white, are used as the bases of sauces, instead of meat 
gravy.
There is too the use of large numbers of pot herbs in one 
dish : ten are used to season the gravy for a sheep's head, and 
fourteen to make a salad dressing.
I have already given you a Roman menu ; I will now give you 
an Old English one, and then I will proceed to comment on some 
of the dibhes.
Like the cana of Rome, so the Old Englibh dinner 
was divided into three courses.
This is a 14th century menu.* 
first Course.
Browet farsed, and charlet, for pottage.
Baked mallard.
Small birds.
Almond milk served with them.
Capon roasted with the syrup.
Roasted Veal.
Pig roasted "endored" and served with the yolk on 
his neck over gilt.
Herons.
A "leche." A tart of flesh.
To take the pottages or stews first.
The " Browet farsed" was 
made thus.
I will give you one recipe in full.
* From Wright's Homes of other Days, p.
362.
24 
Take almonds and pound thena, and mix with beef broth, so as to make it 
thick, and put it in a pot with cloves, maces and figs, currants, and minced 
ginger, and let all this seethe ; take bread, and steep it in sweet wine, and add 
it to the almonds with sugar ; then conies, or young rabbits or squirrels, and 
first parboil them and partridges parboiled ; fry them whole for a lord, but 
otherwise chop into gobbets, and when they are almost fried, cast them in a pot, 
and let them all boil together, and colour with sandal-wood and saffron ; then 
add vinegar and powdered cinnamon strained with wine, and give it a boil ; 
then take it from the fire, and see that the pottage is thin, and throw in a good 
quantity of ginger.
Omit the cinnamon, and add garum, and that is a regtilar Apician 
receipt for a complicated patina.
The other pottage in this course was less complex, and was a 
mixture of poumled pork, milk, eggs, sage, and saffron, ail boiled 
together.
The syrup, or sauce for the capon, was made of pounded 
almonds and wine, coloured with saffron, figs, currants, ground 
gittj^er, cloves, galingale, and cinnamon ; all boiled together and 
then sugared, and poured over the capon.
The Pig roasted "endored," was glazed with yolk of egg, and 
gilt.
The "leche" was made by poundmg together raw pork and 
egj;s; sugar, salt, raisins, currants, minced dates, powdered pepper, 
and cloves were added, and the whole seethed in a bladder.
A 
sauce of raisins and wme, cinnamon and ginger, sandal-wood and 
saffron, was added.
Second Course.
Brewet of Almayne and Viande vial for pottage.
Mallard.
Roasted Rabbit.
Pheasant.
Venison.
Jelly.
A leche.
Hedgehogs.
Pome de orynge.
The Brewet of .\lmayne was another of the Apician pntina or 
stews.
I need not give the recipe.
" Viande royale" consisted of 
Greek or Rhine wine, honey, rice, ginger, pepper, cinnamon, 
cloves, saffron, sugar, mulberries, and sandal-wood, all boiled 
together and salted.
The "Pome de orynge" were balls of pounded pork liver, 
seasoned and flavoured with several ingredients ; then boiled and 
25 
afterwards roasted, and coloured with saffron, sandal-wood, or 
indigo.
nird Course.
Boar in egurdouce and Mavvmene for pottage.
Cranes.
Kid. Cui-lew.
Partridge ; all roasted.
A leclie.
A Crustade.
A peacock endored, and roasted and served with tlie skin on.
Cockagris.
Flampoyntes.
Daryoles.
Pears in syrup.
The two pottages were like the former ones, only more so; more 
complicated — I had nearly said nastier.
The "Crustade" was a raised pie of chicken and pigeons with 
elaborate seasoning and adorning.
The "Cockagris" was an old 
cock stuffed with the mixture of which the Pome de orynge was 
made, sewed to a pig, and the two seethed and roasted together ; 
adorned with egg and saffron, and then covered with gold and 
silver foil.
"Flampoyntes" were pork pies made with cheese, 
and were mild- editions of the Roman salacacabia.
"Daryoles" 
are custards baked in crust.
The main features of this menu, a late 14th century one, are 
distinctly Roman, Apician ; the elaborate over-sauced, over- 
flavoured pottages or stews, are the Apician patina;.
You have probably been wondering where is the Roast Beef of 
Old England in this menu ?
These magnificent and bulky joints 
had no place in the mediaeval cookery of England.
The iron-clad 
Norman barons, who wrung tlie Great Charter from King John, 
and who fought in the wars of the Roses, did not eat huge joints 
of meat, any more than did the patricians and senators of the 
Roman Empire.
The Norman barons in England lived and fought 
on stews, minces, and side dishes, the bulk of which were eaten 
with a spoon.* The prje- Reformation bishops and ecclesiastical 
dignitaries were also great patrons of this Apician cookery; and 
the kitchen establishments of the larger religious houses were on 
a very large scale, as indeed were their feasts.
That when George 
* A friend- suggests that this, and the excessive use of birds at table, was due 
to the Norman barons not knowing that a joint iniproves by keeping, and so 
finding it tough, when used fresh.
Neville was mnde, in 1466, Archbishop of York, was on an 
enormous scale, one thousand sheep and two thousand pi^s being 
but a small item in the accounts.
The mediaeval cooks were grent in "solteltes" or devices in 
pastry, gorgeously decorated with gold and siUer foil, but these 
belong rather to the service of the table, than of the palate, so 
I merely mention them en passant.
To this luxurious sciiool of living, political changes dealt heavy 
blows.
The barons exhausted themselves and their resources in 
the wars of the Roses ; the Reformation knocked on the head the 
monasteries and their great kitchen establishments : thus it came 
about that the habit of profuse and luxurious living gradually 
declined during the i6th and the first half of the 17th century, 
until it was extinguished in the great convulsions which preceded 
the interregnum.
After the Restoration, we find that the table 
among all classes was furnished more soberly and with plainer and 
more substantial dishes, and a new and plainer and bulkier school 
of cookery came to the front.
It is hard to say where it came 
from.
Many assert it was an ui)heaval from below : from the 
Anglo-Saxon element in the nation, which had retained its original 
weakness for lumps of meat, though it had grafted thereon the 
hriw, a distincdy Apician dish.
The poorer classes, however, in 
mediaeval times, seem to have lived mainly on bread, cheese, 
butter, and vegetables, as proved (among other ways.) by the fact 
of the names thereof being English, while mutton, veal, pork, and 
bacon are Norman.
The plainer living seems to have been a 
middle-class upheaval in the i6th and 17th centuries.
It had 
commenced before the days of Queen Elizabeth, but it was 
Charles II.
who knighted the Sirloin of Beef The change was 
great : a few great lords adhered to the Apician style of cookery, 
or Old English : French it now began to be called.
A traveller 
from the continent, in 1698, says of England : — 
" There are some gi-eat lords who have French and English cooks, 
and where you are served much in the French fashion ; but among 
persons of the middle condition, they have ten or twelve sorts of common 
meat, which infallibly come round again in their turns at different times.
27 
and of two dishes of which their dinner is composed, as for instance a 
pudding and a piece of roast beef Sometimes they will have a piece boiled, 
and then it has always lain in salt some days, and is flanked all round with five 
or six mounds of cabbage, carrots, turnips, or some other herbs or roots, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, with melted butter poured over them.
At other 
times they will have a leg of mutton, roasted or boiled, and accompanied by 
the same delicacies ; poultry, sucking pigs, tripe, and beef tongue, rabbits, 
pigeons — all well soaked with butter without bacon.
Two of these dishes 
— always .served one after the other — make the ordinary dinner of a good 
gentleman or of a good burgher."* 
The traveller describes their broth as consisting of the water 
in which the meat had been boiled, mixed with oatmeal and 
with some leaves of thyme, or sage, or such small herbs.
Flour, 
tnilk, eggs, butter, fat, sugar, marrow, raisins, etc., he describes 
as the ingredients of an English pudding, and cheese as their only 
dessert.t

+ A distinguished amateur in gastronomy has directed my attention to a 
remarkable ISth century dinner described iu the fourth chapter of Lord 
Beacousfield's deliglitful romance, "Veuetia," and is anxious to know 
whether the dishes enumerated are really "historical " in a culinary sense, 
or whether the accomplished novelist allowed his fancy to ruu riut in 
picturing a Sunday diiaier at an English cuuutry house about 176S.
"Before him (the Eev. Dr.
Masham) still scrawled in death the counte- 
nance of a huge roast pike, flanked on one side by a leg of mutton « la daube, 
and on the other by the tempting delicacies of bombarded veal.
To these 
succeeded that masterpiece of the culinary art, a grand battalia pie, in 
which the bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits, were embalmed iu spices, 
cock's combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich 
sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs, in which our great grandfathers 
delighted, and which was technically termed a Lear.
But the grand essay 
of skill was the cover of this pastry, whereon the curious cook had contrived 
to represent all the once-living form.s that were now entombed in that 
gorgeous sepulchre." 
There is no case of fancy running riot here.
Chapter and verse could be 
given from old cookery books fur all the dainty dishes described in 
" Venetia." • But of the " historical " accuracy of the " grand battalia pie," 
a curious proof occurs in that delightful book, "The Life of William Hutton, 
and the History of the Hutton Family.
" In his biography of his maternal 
grandmother \V.
H. relates : — 
" She was a careful yet libera) housekeeper, and well skilled in cookery, 
pastry, and confectionery.
I have heard of a pie she raised in the form of 
a goose trussed for the spit ; the real goose was booed ; a duck was boned 
28 
Roman institutions have a marvellous vitality and energy in 
them, and the Roman cookery has reasserted itself in England ; 
partly, no doubt, bv survival (even Hartmann's "Excellent Directions 
for Cookery,'' published in 1682, are tinged widi Apicianisms,) and 
partly by re-importation from France, where it has ever lived, it 
being indeed the cookery of all the Latin races.
Kirwan in his 
" Host and Guest," says that Lord Chesterfield made most 
strenuous efforts to introduce French cookery into England.
He 
engaged as his chef La Chapelle, a descendant of the cook of 
Louis XIV.
La Chapelle in 1733 published in England a 
book on cookery in three volumes.
Time forbids me to go 
into the details of that revival ; but I have already proved 
the connection between our present cookery and the Apician.
Carlisle was in a small way a centre of the Apician revival.
A 
few Frenchmen of Lally's regiment were left here after the 1745 ; 
and in 1758 several hundred French prisoners were sent here on 
parole, and some of these vivacious gentry set up as dancing and 
fencing masters, hair dressers, and cooks.
A distinctly more 
expensive style of living was then introduced into Carlisle, and the 
cookery there became famous in a small way.
I venture now to think that I have detailed "The History of 
the English Palate," and traced it up to t ne Roman palate of the 
Apician school, and through that to the Greek and Lydian.
Dr. Pegge, in concluding his prefatory essay to the Forme 
of Cury, apologises for having been occupied with such trifles, 
and pleads the example of such scholars as Humelbergius, 
Tomius, Barthius, Dr. I-ister, Almeloveen, and others.
I don't set 
and laid within it ; a fowl was boned and laid withiu the duck ; a boned 
partridge within the fowl ; aad a boned pigeon within the partriilge.
The 
whole having been properly seasoned, the iaterstices were filled with 
rich gravy ; aud I have liad pieces of writing paper, cut in variniis figures 
throughout, that were the patterns by which she made her Floreudiues.
" 
There is nothing new under the sun; aud analogues of the "great 
battalia pie" were plentiful in Roman cookery.
See the Banquet scene in 
Professor Becker's " Gallus," ami some very curious passages in Soyer's 
"Pantropheon."— From G.

Yorkshire pie.

up any excuse ; I don't con^Jider my subject matter a trifle ; T take 
a serious view of it.
I agree with Lord Lytton in what he says 
about the Dinner Hour : — 
O hour of all hours, the most bless'd upon earth, 
Blessed hour of our dinners !
The land of his birth : 
The face of his first love : the bills that he owes ; 
The twaddle of friends, and the venom of foes ; 
The sermon he heard when to church he last went ; 
The money he borrow'd, the money he spent ; — 
All of these things a man, I believe, may forget, , 
And not be the worse for forgetting ; but yet.
Never, never, oh never !
earth's luckiest sinner 
Hath unpunish'd forgotten the hour of his dinner !
Indigestion, that conscience of every bad stomach.
Shall relentlessly gnaw and pursue him with some ache 
Or some pain ; and trouble, remorseless, his best ease, 
As the Furies once troubled the sleep of Orestes.
We may live without poetry, music, and art ; 
We may live without conscience, and live without heart ; 
We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks.
He may live without books — what is knowledge but grieving?
He may live without hope — what is hope but deceiving ?
He may live without love — what is passion but pining ?
But where is the man that can live without dining ?

THE PENRITH SANDSTONE.
( Given at Nunntry Walks, l88l.^ 
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, F.G.S., F.Z.S., H.M. Geological Survey.
At Melmerby, on the last occasion when I hacl the honour of 
addressing this Society, it was our good fortune to have before us 
for examination as great a variety of geological matter as could 
well be found in any arra of the same extent in the British Isles.
Here, on the contrary, our geological surroundings are as simple 
as at Melmerby they were complex.
Nevertheless, I hope to be 
able to show that we have here presented for our study much that 
is of more than ordinary interest to the geologist, and that is of 
especial interest to the student of Cumbrian geology.
On the 
present occasion I propose to confine my attention to the study of 
one rock, instead of running cursorily over the whole range of 
rocks of Edenside, and to point out what kind of evidence this 
rock yields, and how that evidence is put together to enable us to 
reconstruct, in imagination, the physical geography of Edenside 
at the time the rock before us was in process of formation.
Amongst the numerous questions that arise in the course of such 
an inquiry are: — What was the general nature of the surface; 
what mountains were in existence here ; what rivers had we then, 
and which way did they flow ; where did this rock come from, and 
how was it formed ; what kind of climate prevailed in those old 
days ; what were the animals like, and what the plants ; in short, 
32 
what light can we throw upon the physical geography of this region 
in those remote times ?
It is perhaps hardly necessary to mention that the rock we now 
stand on belongs to what is called the New Red Sandstone Series 
— that series of strata characterised by a prevailing red hue, and 
that overlies the commercially-important Carboniferous rocks, just 
as the Old Red Sandstone underlies these.
The precise position of the rock more particularly under notice 
on the present occasion, will be made clearer if I here enumerate the 
various members of the New Red Series in the order we have them 
developed in the Eden Valley.
The highest member of the New Red 
here is formed by the great group of red shales that the city of Carlisle 
stands upon.
These are fairly well exposed in the bank of the Eden 
just below Stanwix; and on that account Ilast year (1880) gave them 
the name of the Stanwix Marls, a name that has since been pretty 
generally adopted by geologists.
These Stanwix Marls are suc- 
ceeded by a considerable thickness of red sandstones, which are 
locally of a bright brick-red in their upper portion ; though they 
are more typically represented, as Professor Harkness and others 
have pointed out, by the duller red sandstone that forms so much 
of the beautiful scenery of Corby Walks.
This is the St. Bees 
Sandstone, a rock that plays an important part in the geology of 
the Basin of the Solway.
The St. Bees Sandstone passes down- 
ward into a group of red shales, usually associated with more or 
less gypsum, which is worked at Coat Hill, Eden Lacy, Kirkby 
Thore, and elsewhere in these parts.
Then comes a group of 
strata characterised by being not red.
The Magnesian Limestone 
belongs to the upper portion of this set ; the lower, or Plant Bed 
Series, agrees in both litholo^ical character and geological position 
with the Marl Slate of the north eastern part of England.
Below 
these, and forming the basal group of the series, comes another 
group of sandstones, again red in colour, like those above.
This 
is the Penrith Sandstone, the rock we now stand upon, which was 
so named from the town where it may best be seen.
We owe this 
name to Professor Harkness, who was the first to place the New 
Red Rocks of Edenside in anything like their true order.
33 
At first sight, hardly any rock could seem to present so un 
promising a field for investigation as the Penrith Sandstone does.
The rock itself is almost entirely devoid of traces of fossils ; and it 
is so remarkably uniform in general character that from top to 
bottom there is hardly a single bed in it that can be separately 
traced more than a few yards.
Then, again, the planes of stratifi- 
cation generally found in most sedimentary rocks are replaced 
here by what are called planes of false-bedding, which afford us no 
trustworthy information as to the amount of inclination the rock 
has undergone, and therefore present us with no data for determining 
the true thickness of the rock.
Altogether, it is a most unsatis- 
factory rock for the geological surveyor to have to deal with.
In attempting, therefore, to work out the physical geography of 
this part of England at the time the Penrith Sandstone was being 
accumulated, we often have to go far afield for evidence, and to 
pursue lines of inquiry different from what are generally taken in 
the study of the other rocks.
First of all we have to make out its 
relations to the older strata.
I have before taken occasion to 
point out that this rock lies indifferently upon the edges of widely- 
separated members of the older strata, and that it may be found 
reposing upon the upturned edges of the newest Carboniferous rocks 
of Edenside, as well as upon the contorted Silurian strata of the 
Lake District.
This means that a vast interval of time had elapsed 
between the completion of the Carboniferous Series and the advent 
of the Penrith Sandstone.
The older rocks had been consolidated, 
let down many thousands of feet nearer the centre of the earth, 
and consequently squeezed into folds to adapt themselves to the 
smaller space, afterward they were again upheaved, broken up into 
great wedges by faults, and then were worn away by denudation, 
until the upturned edges of the rocks were shorn off to one general 
level, so that in the end a vertical thickness of nearly twenty 
thousand feet of strata had been removed.
The time required to 
accomplish this result must have been vast beyond conception.
More than this, sufficient time had elapsed for the almost complete 
replacement of the teeming life of the Carboniferous Period by a 
group of animals of a character decidedly different in many respects.
3 
34 
To the ordinary mind these facts may seem of but little import- 
ance ; but to them that believe that the past changes of the earth 
and of its inhabitants have taken place as gradually as they are 
taking place under our own observation, these great revolutions 
betoken a lapse of unrepresented time second only to that between 
the Silurian and the Carboniferous periods, which I have before 
taken occasion to point out as the greatest chronological break we 
have in the entire geological series.
To compare geology with 
history in treating of each of these great unconformities, it is as 
though all records of the doings of man in England from the close 
of the Bronze Period down to the Middles Ages had been com- 
pletely effaced, and we were left to gain our knowledge of the past 
succession of events from imperfect and fragmentary records of 
various other nations afar off In the geological record between 
the close of the Carboniferous Period and the commencement of 
the next formation represented here, a whole chapter, and an 
important chapter too, is missing, and there seems but little hope 
that we shall ever recover more tlian detached fragments of the lost 
pages.
Now, I want to call attention to the fact that in other parts 
of England the imperfection of the geological record relating to this 
period is greater than it happens to be with us — there are more pages 
missing elsewhere than there are here.
Our copy, imperfect though 
it is, includes one or two pages relating to the commencement of the 
new order of things that we look for elsewhere in vain.
In most 
other parts of England the New Red Series is ushered in by the 
Magnesian Limestone — all below that being almost entirely wanting.
But in Edenside we have strata extending downward many hundred 
feet below that horizon, and we are thus enabled to trace back 
the sequence of events to an earlier stage than is possible in other 
parts of England.
There is therefore no need to dwell upon the 
importance of giving the closest possible attention to everything 
connected with the history of the rock at present under notice.
I will now proceed to discuss some of the evidence ; taking first 
the evidence afforded by the physical relations of the Penrith 
Sandstone to the rocks whereon it lies.
It has often been asserted that the Penrith Sandstone lies in an 
35 
old valley, — that is to say, in a long trough extending between the 
Cross Fell Escarpment, or Black Fell Side, as old people call it, 
and the Lake District, which the same people call by the name of 
the West Fells.
According to this view, the area at present occu- 
pied by the Red Rocks nearly or quite coincides with the original 
area of deposition.
I believe that this view will not bear a close 
examination.
If we take a series of measurements downward from 
the first persistent stratum in the Red Rocks to the local base, 
from one end of the area covered by the Penrith Sandstone to the 
other, we get, as it were, a series of soundings, which enable us to 
reconstruct exactly the form of the old surface along that line.
From the north-western end of the Penrith Sandstone area in 
Galloway, to its south-eastern termination near Stainmore, is between 
fifty and sixty miles.
Now, the greatest thickness of strata accumu- 
lated below the first uniform bed along that line, — in other words, 
the lowest depression below the general level of the surface along 
that line — nowhere much exceeds a thousand feet.
This gives us 
a rise of about one in four hundred between the lowest point we 
know anything about, and the highest-known portion of the old 
surface, — a gradient so low, that it is practically inappreciable.
This, of course, is along the line of the supposed old valley.
Transverse to this direction, i.e. across this supposititious valley, 
it is important to bear in mind that there is very little but negative 
evidence to go upon.
Outliers of Penrith Sandstone on the Lake 
District side of its principal area are almost entirely unknown ; so 
that between the valley of the Petteril and the Lake District, 
except about Highet Castle and Raughton Head, there is hardly 
any information attainable bearing upon the form, and the extent, 
of the surface that was once covered by the Penrith Sandstone.
Along the edge of the Cross Fell Escarpment we sometimes get 
the Penrith Sandstone turned up on edge against the Pennine 
Faults, so that we thus have an opportunity of examining a bed of 
rock that is usually at a depth of many hundred feet from the 
surface thereabouts.
It is important to observe, that in no instance 
of this kind does the rock present any appearance of being nearer 
to a shore line there than it is elsewhere ; nor does it in any other 
36 
respect differ in the slightest degree from the type we observe here 
at Nunnery Walks.
We should expect to find traces of shore 
deposits if the line of the present fells had coincided with the old 
shore ; but even where we generally do get beds of coarse material 
in the Penrith Sandstone, as we do elsewhere, near the base, the 
sections along the Escarpment show, if anything, material even 
finer than usual.
Then again, there is evidence of the clearest 
kind to prove that a very consderable upheaval of that upland 
tract has taken place long after the New Red was accumulated, 
and in this case there seems no reason why there should have been 
any bank there at all until long subsequent to the formation of the 
Red Rocks, when a repetition of the rupturing of the strata over the 
lines of weakness formed by the Pennine Faults dislocated these 
strata, and brought them into vertical contact with other strata of 
quite a different nature.
I cannot now enter into detail, which I 
must reserve for a future occasion ; but I can assure you that I 
consider there is good evidence for believing that what is now the 
plane of the fell tops along the Escarpment was once part of the 
nearly-level surface that the Penrith Sandstone was deposited upon.
In other words, I consider that the Penrith Sandstone once covered 
great part of what is now the extensive upland tract intervening 
between the undulating lowlands of Edenside and the outcrop of 
the Magnesian Limestone in the North Eastern parts of England.
What was originally a level surface, has been dislocated by the 
great faults, so that one part of it has been thrown up relatively to 
the other, four or five thousand feet, and that then the wasting 
influence of denudation has removed all the Red Rocks and again 
exposed the Carboniferous Rocks to the day, just as has happened 
elsewhere in Edenside.
I must ask you to dismiss from your 
minds the very existence of the hills and valleys before us, and to 
imagine in their place a great plain extending hence far away in 
the direction of the North Sea. The hills now occurring in that 
direction were not hills until long after the period we are now 
considering, and the valleys date back, comparatively speaking, 
but from yesterday.
In the neighbourhood of Appleby there is some kind of evidence 
37 
that there was a gradual rise of about eight hundred feet in an 
easterly direction ; but the paucity or the entire absence of any 
fragments of Precarboniferous origin amongst the coarse detrital 
rocks in the area referred to, would seem to lend no support to 
the view that the core of those older rocks was then exposed at 
the surface in that part of the district.
Those rocks were exposed 
on the north side of the Solway, and also in West Cumberland 
and North Lancashire at this period ; but I don't think the Car- 
boniferous rocks had been entirely removed here.
There is another reason for believing that the Lake mountains 
do not represent a great fossil island re-exposed by denudation.
In no case that has come under my notice does the dip, or present 
inclination, of the New Red fall short of the amount of inclination 
of the surface that rises from beneath it in the direction of the 
Lake District, The angle of the dip denotes the degree of tilting 
the rocks have undergone since they were laid down.
Depress 
the inclined surface that rises from beneath the New Red sufficiently 
to level the newer rock, and you would lower the highest mountains 
of the Lake District far below the sea level.
In other words, to 
tilt the New Red to the angle it now lies at, the whole of the 
central core of Precarboniferous rocks had to be lifted up four or 
five thousand feet after the New Red was formed.
That is to say, 
the upheaval that caused the tilting is of later date than the New 
Red, and the Penrith Sandstone is older than any mountain or 
valley we can point to from here.
Some people try to make out that a chain of hills corresponding 
to our Pennine Chain existed long before our Penrith Sandstone 
period, and they point, in confirmation of this view, to the great 
difference in character between the New Red on the one side of 
England and that on the other.
Now this difference is not nearly 
as great as has been made out.
It seems not to be generally 
known that we have the Magnesian Limestone here also, and that 
this Magnesian Limestone is thickening in the direction of 
Durham at such a rate in Edenside itself, that, if it were prolonged 
a few miles further in that direction would cause it to rival in 
thickness any Magnesian Limestone occurring in Durham.
And 
38 
people do not seem to be aware that the very top beds of our 
Penrith Sandstone also occur in Durham below the Magnesian 
Limestone, just as they occur here.
What we really get is a great 
wedge of Magnesian Limestone with its thin edge pointing towards 
the west coast of England, which wedge has been afterwards broken 
through the middle, partly over the line of the Great Faults, by the 
subsequent upheaval of the Pennine Chain.
I have entered into some detail upon these controverted points, 
because they have an important bearing upon the past history of 
Edenside, and because they are specially important in relation to 
the history I am attempting to elucidate.
So far, then, I think we may venture to form some kind of idea 
as to what the old surface was like.
Most, if not all, the present 
surface features then had no existence.
Hills and valleys there 
may have been — indeed must have been — but at the period we are 
now considering we have no indubitable evidence of their existence 
where our chief mountain masses now are.
We have next to inquire what rivers existed hereabouts at this 
period.
Here, again, I am compelled to dissent from the com- 
monly-received opinions.
It seems to be generally assumed that, 
if we find any one of these newer deposits occupying the bottom 
of what is now a valley, that the rock is there because it was 
originally deposited in an old valley, which is being re-exposed by 
the gradual removal of the old deposit.
There must, of course, 
be a great many instances of rock deposited along long lines of 
depression, which may often represent old river- valleys ; but in the 
majority of the cases that have come under my notice the facts 
would be correctly expressed by saying that it is the valley that 
lies in the Red Rocks, and not that it is the Red Rocks that lie in the 
valley.
The valley is there now because there is a soft upper group 
of rocks bent into a downfold along with a lower group of rocks of 
a more durable character.
All the rocks, upper soft, and lower 
hard alike, have been bent into a series of folds, which have after- 
wards been planed off to a nearly uniform surface.
Along the 
parts where the softer rock has been folded in, the surface wastes 
somewhat faster than it does elsewhere, and, as a consequence, 
39 
tends to form lower ground along that line than along the part 
where the rocks do not weather so fast.
One consequence of this 
is, that any river that happens to be passing that way is guided 
more and more into the line of this fold, simply because the surface 
is lower there, and water always tends towards the lowest level.
Now, it nearly always happens that a greater thickness of the newer 
rock is left along the middle than along the sides ; as a conse- 
quence, it takes longer to clear it out from the bottom of the valley 
than it does from its sides, which are completely bared of all traces 
of the newer rock when a considerable thickness may yet occupy 
the bottom of the valley.
So it comes about that we find the last 
traces of these deposits now occupying the bottoms of the valleys, 
and that people are led to believe that these traces are there now 
because the valley is older than the rock it contains.
We do seem 
to get some kind of evidence of two or three streams coming into 
the line of the Eden Valley from the direction of the Lake District ; 
but in no case do we seem to have any trace of a line of depression 
in the old surface where these streams came in, and I think it 
quite likely that the lines of rock fragments that form the sole 
evidence for the existence of these supposed rivers may have been 
brought into their present position in quite a different way.
If we do not know of the existence of any mountains, and cannot 
feel sure about the existence of any rivers here, at the period we 
are considering, we may at least feel tolerably certain about the 
existence of one feature here which, in a somewhat different form, 
is one of the prominent characteristics of this district at the present 
day.
We may, I think, agree with Professor Ramsay in regarding 
the tract around us as the site of part of an old lake.
You have probably remarked, if you have compared these rocks 
around us with them that form, for instance, the line of hills 
extending along the north side of Cumberland, through Westmor- 
land, into Yorkshire, or with them that constitute the mountains 
of the Lake District, that whereas they are characterised by no tint 
in particular, but range through all shades of brown, grey, blue, 
and black, these rocks around us are characterised throughout by 
a tolerably uniform tint of red.
It varies a little in its shades, but 
40 
the prevailing hue is nearly always red of some kind or other.
We 
have several such groups of red strata in the geological series — the 
Old Red Sandstone, or a part of it, at all events, is a good example.
All these red rocks have certain peculiarities in common.
I'hey 
contain hardly any fossils, and the few they do contain are of 
peculiar types.
The rocks are red, not because they are made up 
of grains that are red throughout, but because each separate com- 
ponent grain is coated over with a film of peroxide of iron.
Then, 
again, they are all more or less associated with certain chemical 
deposits either imperfectly-developed or wanting altogether in the 
rocks that are not-red.
Lastly, the fossils that occur in the not-red 
strata, interstratified with the red deposits, are of a character quite 
unlike that of the fossils we get from beds that all agree in regarding 
as of marine origin.
Many years ago Mr. Godwin Austin suggested that these red 
strata may owe their exceptional character to their having been 
accumulated in great inland lakes like the Caspian, the Dead Sea, 
the Salt Lake, and others.
Leaving the peculiar character of the 
fossils out of sight, we do not know of any marine deposits in 
process of formation at the present day wherein the component 
grains are being coated with a film of peroxide of iron.
On the 
other hand, we do know of many lakes wherein a considerable 
deposit of ferruginous matter, in one form or another, accumulates 
in the course of even a year.
In some of the Swedish lakes, for 
instance, this annual accumulation takes place in quantities sufficient 
to make it worth while to dredge the bottom of the lake period- 
ically, merely for the sake of the iron ore.
The iron is probably 
brought into the lake in the form of the soluble carbonate of iron, 
which is altered into the peroxide after deposition.
Or it may arise 
through organic agencies.
At any rate, it is known to be in process 
of deposition in inland lakes ; while it is not known to be forming 
beneath the waters of the sea.
But if we experience a difficulty in accounting for the deposition 
of iron ore under ordinary marine conditions, the difficulty is greater 
when we have to account for the deposits of gypsum.
Under no 
conditions we yet have any knowledge of could deposits of gypsum 
41 
take place in the open sea.
In this case, again, a knowledge of 
what takes places in inland lakes enables us to gain some insight 
into the origin of these deposits also.
AVhen rain falls we all know 
that some part of it flows over the surface to the nearest stream, 
and thence away out to sea ; another part of it is evaporated ; and 
the remainder sinks into the rocks, and soaks downward, until it is 
stopped by an impervious or waterproof bed, whicli keeps tlie water 
at that level until it finds its vi'ay out at the surface in the form of 
a spring.
In passing through the rocks the carbonic acid in the 
rain-water enables it to dissolve various small quantities of the 
mineral matter it is passing through, and to hold these in solution.
The Eden before us is at this moment carrying out to sea consider- 
able quantities of such mineral matter, which it has collected from 
the rocks in the upper part of its course.
It is this mineral, 
matter that makes, the water what we call "hard." When the 
water of the spring finds its way through the rivers out to sea, this 
mineral matter is lost sight of, at any rate for a time.
But where 
the water is discharged into a lake with no outflow, all the drainage 
of the hydrographical basin around has to be got rid of by evapor- 
ation.
When impure water is evaporated the water only is carried 
off, leaving the mineral matter behind.
The consequence is that 
the constant evaporation of the spring-water carried into these 
inland lakes leaves year by year a gradually-increasing percentage 
of mineral matter behind.
After a time the percentage of salts 
rises above the point of saturation — the water of the lake can hold 
no more in solution — and then the various salts begin to be 
precipitated in a solid form.
The nature of these salts varies 
according to the composition of the rocks traversed by the feeders 
of the lake.
In one instance it is carbonate of lime, in another 
sulphate of lime, in a third carbonate of magnesia, in a fourth 
carbonate of iron, that forms the principal mineral held in solution.
But even where several different salts are being brought down 
concurrently, they are not all deposited at the same place, or at 
the same time, because the point of saturation varies for each 
mineral, and the deposition of one salt out of a complex solution 
42 
may commence long before that of the other salts brought down in 
solution at the same time.
In the Penrith Sandstone we seem to have had large quantities 
of carbonate of iron and carbonate of magnesia deposited first.
If 
there were any other minerals they have gone and left no traces 
behind.
By the time the top beds of the Penrith Sandstone were 
being spread out, a little Common Salt had begun to be thrown 
down; but just at this period there seems to have been a temporary 
change of physical conditions, for we get a change of sediment 
and rocks of another kind.
After this temporary change we had 
carbonate of iron as before, this time accompanied by sulphate of 
lime and occasionally by a little more Common Salt.
Then when 
we get to the higher strata whose remains are yet left around 
Carlisle, we get more abundant traces of salt, with sulphate of hrae 
and carbonate of iron as before, until in the end the land sank 
down and admitted the sea.
With the changed conditions came 
in sediment that formed rocks of a character quite different from 
them we are more immediately concerned with.
I have intentionally been a little discursive here, because I 
wanted to point out that all our Red Rocks have certain features 
in common, and that these features do not agree with the character- 
istic features of deposits of marine origin, while they do agree 
almost exactly with the features of deposits that have accumulated 
in great inland lakes.
We owe this generalisation to Professor 
Ramsay, who has devoted much time and thought to the working 
out of problems of this nature.
Besides the evidence afforded by 
the nature of the chemical deposits associated with the Red Rocks, 
we get other evidence that is perhaps equally conclusive.
Professor 
Harkness, who did so much to work out the true relations of our 
Red Rocks, has found casts, in sand and in mud, of the peculiar 
hopper-shaped crystals of bay salt, in several places in Edenside.
These crystals take too long to form to have been developed on a 
foreshore in the interval between the ebb of one tide and the flow 
of the next ; or even in the longer interval between spring and 
neap tides, so that their marine origin under ordinary conditions 
43 
is nearly out of the question.
Then, we get sun-cracks — the 
desiccation fissures produced by the partial drying of the surface 
of sand flats while the water was low in the old lakes.
Besides 
this we get gas-bubbles here and there in some of the top beds of 
the Penrith Sandstone — just such bubbles as are formed in the 
mud of shallow ponds by the evolution of marsh gas.
Lastly, the 
Penrith Sandstone has yielded many impressions of the feet of the 
strange animals that wandered over the half-consolidated silt of the 
old sand flats.
These footprints are especially interesting, because 
they afford us the sole traces of groups of animals long since 
extinct — animals whose very forms are quite unknown to us, and 
whose nature can be inferred only from the resemblance between 
their footprints and those of their — perhaps totally different — 
representatives of the present day.
There is yet another point connected with the Physical Geo- 
graphy of this region that I cannot pass over without a brief notice.
When we trace the Penrith Sandstone across the north-western parts 
of Dumfries, in the direction of Ayrshire, we find — so Professor 
Geikie tells us — that bands of volcanic matter, marking the occur- 
rence of intermittent showers of volcanic ashes, begin to be inter- 
stratified along with Penrith Sandstone of the ordinary character, 
and when we get fairly into Ayrshire, these beds of volcanic tuff" 
and breccia are further accompanied by beds of rock representing 
old sheets of lava.
We know from this, that a volcano, probably a 
group of volcanoes, was in full action in those old times at a point 
almost visible from Nunnery Walks.
On the Continent volcanic 
action seems to have been equally rife at the same period.
When it is considered that the Penrith Sandstone is almost the 
sole representative in the British Isles of the rocks missing between 
the Carboniferous Series and the Magnesian Limestone, the im- 
portance of a careful study of all that is likely to throw any light 
upon the history of these parts in those remote times, will be evident 
to most of us.
I shall therefore now proceed to lay before you 
what evidence we have been able to collect regarding the climate 
of that period.
In ordinary questions of this kind the geologist at 
once betakes himself to the study of the various organisms en- 
44 
tombed in the rock, and endeavours to arrive at some general 
conclusions regarding the condition of things in the past, by a 
comparison of these remains with others of animals now existing, 
and of whose life history we have the means of learning something 
definite.
In the present case this kind of evidence fails us entirely, 
and we are compelled to fall back upon the evidence aiforded by 
the physical character of the rock for the elucidation of this point.
Fortunately the Penrith Sandstone presents many features that are 
full of significance to the geologist, and we may, I think, venture 
to base our reasoning upon these almost as safely as upon any 
evidence derived from a study of the fossils, although it may be 
necessary to follow up this evidence in a round-about kind of way.
I have pointed out that the rock we are now on is the result of 
successive accumulations of sand in the bed of an old lake.
The 
deposition of such a mass of sediment (which, in the Eden Valley 
alone, is probably not far short of fifty cubic miles even in the 
present fragmentary remnant of the rock,) implies that an equal 
quantity of material has been slowly reduced to a transportable 
form from a pre-existing mass of rock somewhere else, and after- 
wards transferred to this its present resting place.
It is important 
to discover where that mass of rock lay.
The Penrith Sandstone 
hereabouts largely consists of grains of quartz, mingled with a 
smaller quantity of bits of kaolinized felspar.
Mica, the mineral 
that usually accompanies these two in almost every sedimentary 
rock where they are present, is absent almost entirely in this rock.
Now there is this peculiarity about much of the quartz, as Pro- 
fessor Harkness was the first to point out, that whereas in ordinary 
sandstones it usually occurs in the form of little rounded grains 
without any general uniformity of outline, in the Penrith Sandstone 
it occurs in the form of double six-faced pyramids, occasionally 
slightly worn, it is true, but still recognisable by the thousand.
It 
is these that impart the rough grain and the sparkling aspect to so 
much of the stone used for building about Penrith.
Similar 
double pyramids occur commonly enough in many rocks of 
plutonic origin, and crystals of the same form may be developed 
in a rock in other ways.
But some of these doubly-terminated 
45 
p)Tamids of quartz are water-worn, and therefore must have existed 
as crystals before they came into their present positions.
There 
is this pecuHarity about quartz, that whereas other minerals of a 
definite crystalline form may be fractured, or even pounded into 
fine dust, and yet every separate fragment will bear some definite 
relation to the crystalline form of the original, quartz, in whatever 
crystalline form it may be found, can never be fractured, even 
with most skilful manipulation, into any form at all approaching 
that of the original.
We may infer from this, either that these 
crystals represent the waste of a rock that largely consisted of 
crystalline quartz of this form ; or else that, if the view is correct 
that the crystalline form is due to the deposition of silica in a 
crystalline form around a pre-existing nucleus formed by a grain of 
sand, that part, at least, of this deposition of silica took place 
before the rock-material settled into its present resting-place.
Even 
then we have to account for the silica.
Is it possible that both 
the silica, and part of the iron too, may have been derived from 
Diatoms ?
Their siliceous cases may easily have been dissolved 
by the alkaline water, carried down into the lake in solution, and 
subsequently precipitated as one of the results of the complex 
chemical reactions there taking place.
If this were the case, it 
would help to explain much connected with the Penrith Sandstone 
that is otherwise obscure.
We have next to inquire in what direction this sand has travelled.
Everyone must have remarked the curious and somewhat puzzling 
appearance generally presented by what looks like the stratification 
of the Penrith Sandstone.
Certain layers are clearly seen to be 
inclined at a considerable angle in one direction or another, and 
then just above or below these comes another set lying with 
an angle altogether different.
It is quite common for these upper 
layers to rest directly upon the ends of the lower, just as if the 
upper layer were unconformable to the beds beneath.
Hardly any 
of these, in this particular case, represent the true stratification, 
but are what is called false-bedding planes, which are produced by 
the action of strong currents of water rolling the sand forward at 
the bottom of the lake, now in one direction and then in another 
46 
as the current varies.
There is one invariable rule about these 
false-bedding planes, and that is that they always slope in the 
direction the material has travelled.
If the sand came from the 
east towards the west, then the inclined layers face towards the 
west more or less.
This can be better understood by imagining a 
quantity of sand and gravel to be brought out of a railway cutting 
and thrown down endlong in successive layers as it is when it is 
employed to form an embankment.
The slope of the successive 
layers of material so thrown down invariably faces in the same 
direction as the material has been transported.
Looking up the 
slope at the end of the embankment, we should be looking in the 
direction of the cutting the sand and gravel had been got from.
In like manner, if we obtain a series of observations upon the 
prevailing directions of the false-bedding planes in a rock, we 
know for certain in what direction the parent source of that rock 
lay.
Observations have proved that, with few exceptions, the 
false-bedding planes in the Penrith Sandstone slope away from the 
east, and therefore we know that the source of the material must 
be looked for in that direction.
Now when we trace the Penrith 
Sandstone away from this point where we now are, in the direction 
of Dumfries on the one hand, and of Kirkby Stephen on the other, we 
find certain parts of the rock becoming more and more charged with 
fragments of other rocks.
These fragments, as a rule, we can easily 
trace to their parent sources, which, in the case of the Westmorland 
deposits, usually lie to the south or to the south-east of their present 
positions.
The history of the climate of the period is, many 
geologists think, plainly written upon these deposits, and may be 
easily deciphered by any one who will set about it in the right 
way.
In a deposit accumulated in the ordinary way, under water, 
the materials are commonly more or less sorted out according to 
their respective sizes.
Unless the currents happen to be subject 
to considerable variations in force, they leave little with little and 
big with big.
A current strong enough to roll a big stone along 
the bed of the stieam carries a smaller one much farther, and 
leaves the still bigger stones unmoved.
More than that, one 
result of the frequent knocking of such stones against each other 
47 
is to break off and wear down all the prominent angles, so that the 
stones gradually assume more and more of a rounded form, just as 
we see them in the bed of the Eden below us.
Beds of stones 
rounded in that way form what we call gravel when the stones lie 
uncorapacted, and conglomerate when they are all bound together 
into a compact mass.
If the fragments are not rounded, then the 
compacted rock formed of such material is distinguished as a 
breccia.
The coarse beds occurring in the Penrith Sandstone are 
largely — often exclusively — made up of such angular fragments, 
which form the rock locally denominated Brockram.
The stones 
in these breccias are mixed together without any regard to either 
their shape or their size.
In a bed consisting of fragments having 
a general size of, say, a walnut, stones as big as one's head or 
bigger are not at all uncommon ; and these stones are all frequently 
quite angular.
Now these beds of Brockram are well stratified 
and are interbedded with sheets of fine-grained sandstone; so when 
we find stones of all sizes up to two feet in diameter scattered 
indiscriminately throughout both the breccias and the fine sand- 
stone, we may venture to feel tolerably certain that they have not 
got into their present position in the ordinary way.
Floating trees 
often transport big stones many miles entangled in their roots, but 
there seems to have been no floating trees at that time, in this part 
at least ; and besides, these stones are far too numerous to be 
accounted for in so exceptional a way.
There is a considerable 
resemblance between these beds of breccia and many parts of our 
well-known glacial drift, and if it had not been that the stones in 
the breccias are all arranged with their longer axes parallel to the 
bedding planes — if they did not all lie on their flat sides — and if 
the rock as a whole had not been most clearly stratified throughout, 
they would have been at once set down as old glacial deposits.
Indeed, they have been more than once referred to a glacial origin 
by those who have not been fully aware of the facts I have 
mentioned.
That ice has had to do with their anomalous character 
I have no doubt, but this ice must have been in the form of coast 
ice, like the Ice-foot of the Arctic regions.
As the land sank down 
and various portions of the sloping shores were successively brought 
48 
to the level of the old lake, shore-ice seems to have laid hold of 
such angular fragments of rock as were already loosened by long- 
continued exposure to the action of the weather, and then, as the 
frost gave way a little, the icy fringe became detached from the 
shore and floated away into deeper water, dropping its burden of 
stones here and there over the bottom of the old lake amidst the 
finer material accumulated in the ordinary way.
Stones dropping 
through water in this way arrange themselves in layers, and fail 
more or less on their sides, or, to speak more precisely, with their 
larger axes parallel to the planes of deposition.
Even in our own 
comparatively-mild winters the ice that forms near the margin of 
our lakes occasionally freezes into the shingle, and then, when the 
frost breaks up, drifts away with its tiny load to drop it elsewhere, 
as the ice melts.
Under more severe climatal conditions this 
action of floating ice becomes an important factor in the formation 
of the rocks of the present day.
In the large lakes of North 
America, for instance, the break-up of the winter ice must bring 
about a mingling of no inconsiderable quantity of coarse shore- 
material along with the finer sedimentary matter drifted in by the 
ordinary currents flowing into the lake.
Breccias similar to this 
Brockram occur elsewhere in the Lower New Red, and some of 
these contain stones that are grooved and striated like what we get 
from deposits of undoubted glacial origin.
So I think we need 
have no hesitation in accepting the view put forward by Professor 
Ramsay, that these Lower New Red breccias betoken climatal 
conditions far more severe than any that we are accustomed to in 
these parts at the present day.
Of course, if it can be shown that 
beds in the Penrith Sandstone have been formed in a more 
rigorous climate than that we now experience here, the Penrith 
Sandstone, which was formed at the same time, must also represent 
a period, or a succession of periods, of severe cold.
So far, then, I have endeavoured to show that the rock around 
us contains within itself a record of much of its past history.
The 
various pieces of evidence that the conclusions are based upon are 
not always of equal value, but they that will take the trouble to 
inquire fully into the matter will, I think, in the end arrive at 
49 
conclusions not essentially diflferent from what I have endeavoured 
to set forth now.
There yet remains the question as to what the life of the period 
was like, and a very important question it is too.
In these days, 
when the mind of every thoughtful person is more or less stirred 
by questions concerning the relations of hfe of the Present to that 
of the Past, we peer with intense interest into the past life history 
of every formation in the least degree likely to furnish material for 
the more complete knowledge of the past succession of life.
The 
life of the older Carboniferous Period is represented by a consider- 
able variety of forms of both animal and vegetable life, which may 
be met with in abundance within a radius of even a few miles from 
our present position.
But in the long lapse of time that intervened 
between the close of this older formation and the commencement 
of the great series of marine deposits, represented by the Lias, the 
whole of the varied and abundant marine fauna of the Carboniferous 
epoch seems to have been almost entirely replaced by another and 
totally different set of forms.
No one now-a-days believes that 
this great revolution took place all at once.
Somewhere or other, not 
far off, were the modified descendants of the older forms.
Whence 
came the forms that took their places ?
Did the Carboniferous 
animals migrate farther and farther away as changed physical 
conditions rendered their existence impossible ?
Or did their 
descendants recede only to such a distance as suited their modes 
of life, to return again and again, in a more and more modified 
form each time the old Physical Geography was adapted to their 
existence ?
So far as the Penrith Sandstone itself is concerned we 
are unable to answer these queries.
To make any comparison at 
all we must be sure that the animals whose forms we are comparing 
lived under the same conditions.
It would not do, for instance, 
to expect to find much resemblance between the animals whose 
remains may happen to be dredged up from the bottom of Ullswater 
and those that we may obtain from the sea bottom off Whitehaven.
We must compare marine life with marine.
Close above the 
Penrith Sandstone, however, comes a deposit that looks as if it 
had really been partly marine.
What fossils we do get in it 
5 
50 
represent in a general way the fossils we obtain from the Carbon- 
iferous rocks ; but although there is a general resemblance, very 
few of the fossils are actually identical in form.
Most of them are 
more or less dwarfed, and the few that look most like the remains 
from the older formation have more or less of a changed aspect.
In this case we seem to have got some kind of evidence that the 
life groups of the Carboniferous fauna survived at no great distance 
from their old ground, and that when marine conditions temporarily 
set in again, a few of their descendants, more or less changed in 
form, returned for a time, until a relapse of uncongenial environ- 
ments again caused their banishment.
Whether such of their 
relations as did not return betook themselves elsewhere, and lived 
on till later times we have no means of knowing.
But we do 
know that at no great distance off, at this same time, a great colony 
of other animals had been gradually encroaching upon the ground 
occupied by the older forms of life, and that when marine con- 
ditions again set in over this area, the advancing colony obtained 
possession of the ground, and the representatives of the older 
phases of life appear here no more.
The few traces of life that 
have hitherto been detected in the Penrith Sandstone are almost 
exclusively those of terrestrial animals, and these traces, as I have 
before mentioned, are almost exclusively mere footprints of the 
animals that wandered over the half-consolidated silt on the shores 
of the old lake.
Such vestiges as these do not afford any very 
satisfactory data for the reconstruction of the forms of animals 
otherwise quite unknown to us ; but they that have given much 
attention to the subject — Professor Owen amongst others — tell 
us that these footprints were probably those of gigantic frog-like, 
tortoise-like, lizard-like, and it may even be also of bird -like 
vertebrates.
In regard to the general nature of the life of the period, not 
only had man not yet appeared upon the earth, but so far as we 
know, no representatives of the class that man belongs to had yet 
appeared, or perhaps I ought rather to say, have yet been found.
The oldest known mammal was obtained firom beds of the same 
age as the Stanwix Marls.
We have likewise no certain evidence 
51 
that any true birds had as yet appeared.
Even fish, in the forms 
most famihar us, had yet to appear ; and the same may be said of 
several other groups of animals that are better known to the 
palseontologist than to the general observer.
The traces of plants 
we meet with, bear, like the animal remains, some kind of relation- 
ship to them that lived in the Carboniferous period ; yet in hardly 
any case does the resemblance amount to absolute identity.
What 
difference there is seems to suggest that the descendants of the 
Carboniferous Flora had lived on at no great distance, gradually 
changing in form as time went on, and now and then extending 
their area in this direction until changed physical conditions ushered 
in the newer flora that had long been gradually encroaching upon 
the ground of the old.
Unfortunately, the Penrith Sandstone is 
singularly destitute of organic remains — Red Rocks nearly always 
are.
It is conceivable that no life could well thrive in water that 
may be compared to that of a chalybeate spring ; but this hardly 
accounts for the very remarkable absence of any trace of drifted 
vegetation.* Can it be that the shore line of the old lake and of its 
tributaries as well were utterly destitute of vegetable growth ?
Did 
the old lake form a sort of Dead Sea ?
It looks very much like it.
We know that life was ready to occupy the ground, because as 
soon as a slight change of physical conditions brought in the rocks 
that lie on the top of the Penrith Sandstone, that is to say, the 
Helton Plant Beds, vegetable life seems to have existed in sufficient 
abundance to form thin seams of lignite and of coal.
* The deposit of Lignite near the Giant's Caves on the Eamont is a remark 
able exception.

THIRLMERE AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS.
By \V .
WILSON.
(Read before the Keswick Society.) 
The immediate neighbourhood of Thirlmere is not very rich in 
tradition ; yet there are a few places around it which possess some 
degree of interest.
In addition to this, the scheme of making an 
embankment across the foot of the lake, and impounding its waters 
to form a huge reservoir for the purpose of supplying the populous 
city of Manchester with good water, has of late years attracted 
considerable attention.
I shall venture to put before you a descrip- 
tion of the lake as we have seen it to-day, also a few particulars I 
have noted in regard to the water scheme.
I shall also relate 
some o/ the traditions and legends of the neighbourhood as I have 
heard them from the dalesfolk on various occasions, and during a 
time when I was one amongst the rest of them.
The lake, though best known as Thirlmere, is also called Leathes 
Water and sometimes Wythburn Water.
Its ancient name was 
Brackmere or Bracken Water.
The length of the lake is three 
miles, and its greatest breadth a little over a quarter of a mile.
It 
is five hundred and thirty-three feet above the level of the sea ; its 
greatest depth is eighteen fathoms, or one hundred and eight feet.
The lake in shape resembles a sand-glass, being very narrow near 
the middle, and is there crossed by a bridge.
Alongside the 
bridge is a ford by which conveyances of all kinds have to pass on 
their way to and from Armboth.
The bridge, which is used by 
foot passengers only, is curiously constructed.
In place of arches, 
54 
there are three passages for the flow of the water between the upper 
and lower portions of the lake, and these passages are crossed by 
wooden bridges with their extremities resting on stone abutments.
The three divisions are connected by a wall of rubble masonry, 
covered on the top by flat stones.
This wall being raised to an 
elevation above the lower water line, enables foot passengers to 
cross the lake when it contains a considerable depth of water.
The 
length of the wall from end to end is nearly one hundred and 
twenty yards.
On occasions when high floods are prevalent, the 
lake is frequently impassable for hours together, even for foot 
passengers.
There are but few bridges remaining built on the 
same principle.
Mr. Smiles, in his "Lives of Engineers," mentions 
one of somewhat similar construction in Wales.
This style of 
bridge building is said to belong to the Celts, and, if that be so, it 
goes far to prove that the structure is of considerable antiquity.
Dale Head, which is nearly opposite to Armboth House, on the 
other side of the lake, belonged to the Leathes family from the 
nineteenth year of Queen Ehzabeth's reign till a few years ago, 
when it was purchased, along with several other estates round Thirl- 
mere, by the Corporation of Manchester, who found it necessary to 
secure the land adjoining the lake before commencing their gigantic 
water scheme of taking the water of Thirlmere Lake to supply the 
wants of the inhabitants of Cottonopolis.
This project, if carried 
out as proposed — that is by making a tunnel underneath the Raise, 
thence forward by an aqueduct or other means to the great city of 
manufactures — will be one of the greatest engineering enterprises 
of the day, and will for one thing have the curious effect of causing 
the waters of Thirlmere to run out in the opposite way : instead of 
taking the direction of almost due north, the outflow will then be 
to the south.
A few particulars in regard to the Thirlmere scheme may not be 
uninteresting now that we have just viewed the situation, and these 
I shall give on the authority of the Manchester papers.
The 
Guardian says : — "The cost of carrying out the scheme, land 
included and all rights satisfied, is estimated at _;;^i, 700,000, that 
is for the first instalment of 10,000,000 gallons per day.
Each 
55 
10,000,000 in addition would cost about ;^4oo,ooo.
The building 
of the embankment is not regarded by engineers as being a work 
of much difficulty, owing to the character of the surroundings, 
which afford every possible facility for the impounding of water.
It will be two hundred and thirty-six yards long, sixty feet above 
the present water level, and the lake will be within ten feet of its 
summit.
It is intended that compensation water shall be dis- 
charged into St. John's Beck by means of a tunnel driven through 
the solid rock ; therS will be no pipe through the embankment ; 
thus what in many cases is a source of danger will be avoided.
The present superficial area of Thirlmere is three hundred and 
fifteen acres.
When the lake is raised fifty feet, as proposed, this 
will be increased to nearly eight hundred acres, and the level above 
the sea will then be five hundred and eighty-four feet.'' 
The Manchester Courier says: — "The embankment will be 
constructed so as to be in character with the scenery around.
There will be no engineering structures upon it or around it to 
mar the beauty of the scene, and the public will gain the advantage 
of ready access to the western side of the lake by the new road 
intended to be formed.
The embankment need not be a straight 
stiff line, as such works generally are ; but the contour may be as 
irregular as the lovers of the picturesque may desire.
In a few 
years, when covered with trees and vegetation, as it will be — the 
same as Great Howe and the hills around — its artificial character 
would make it none the less a charming feature in the landscape ; 
while the capacity of the lake will be more than doubled, thereby 
adding vastly by its increased extent to the beauty and grandeur 
of the scenery, while it is, at the same time, providing hundreds of 
thousands of people with one of the necessaries of life." 
There is great difference of opinion in regard to what will be the 
effect produced by the proposed scheme, and the promoters met 
with determined opposition from numbers of influential gentlemen 
belonging to all parts of the kingdom, who formed what was called 
the Thirlmere Defence Association.
Before the Select Committee 
of the House of Commons they opposed the Bill in 1878.
This 
had the effect of several modifications being introduced in regard 
56 
to the promoters supplying water to towns along the route of the 
water course, and other matters.
The Bill, as we all know, was 
eventually carried, and although, so far, little or nothing has been 
dorie by way of commencement, the Corporation of Manchester 
have at any rate secured the position.
Above the bridge, and skirting the lake on the east side, is Dale 
Head Park, and along the upper side of the park is the Ambleside 
and Keswick turnpike road.
The part of this road which leads 
over the park is rather steep, and has for generations had the repu- 
tation of being haunted.
Mr. Richardson, in his " Cummerlan' 
Talk," gives the story of a dalesman who alleged that he had on 
different occasions seen the Dale Head Park Boggle.
On one 
occasion it was said to assume the very common-place form of a 
lime and mound heap; but at another time it appeared in the form 
of an immense fire, which extended higher than the plantation 
above, and sparks fell in showers on all sides.
Vet, strange to say, 
this seems to have been a fire that burnt without consuming, for 
according to the old man's account, "Theer was nowder a black 
pleace nur a bit o' gurse swing't, nur nea udder mark o' t' fire 'at 
I cud see, for aw," he goes on to say, " it wasn't a quarter of an 
hoor sen I saw t' greit fire blazan away furiously." 
There is a tradition that a foul murder was once committed near 
the place, and this circumstance probably gave rise to the boggle 
stories.
The story of the murder is as follows : — ^A labouring man 
who lived at Dale Head had been working at a place near Wyth- 
burn for a few days.
One evening he left with the intention of 
going home — a place he never reached alive — having at the time a 
few weeks' wages "in his pocket.
He was not missed until a few 
days after this, when his dead body was found in the lake stark 
naked, with a deep wound in his forehead ; and from these circum- 
stances it was supposed that the man had been murdered for the 
sake of his money.
Various things afterwards transpired to fix the 
guilt on a man who is described as "an ill hang-gallows of a 
tailyer," who at that time lived at Fornside ; but no steps were 
taken to bring him to justice, the neighbours contenting themselves 
with giving hira hints about the occurrence, which he did not like, 
whenever they met him at the public-house.
At last he became 
so frightened that he durst not sleep in his own house for fear of 
being taken, but passed his nights out on the fell above, at place 
which has been called Sim's Cave, from the man's christian name.
Finally the place became so hot for him that he left the neighbour- 
hood, and was never heard of afterwards.
About a quarter of a mile from the head of Thirlmere is a large 
rock, which stands out prominently on the margin of the lake, 
which is known by the name of " Clark's Lowp." The water is 
deepest between this point and the opposite side, and in stormy 
weather the lake here looks very black and frowning.
The tradition 
in connection with this is, that a man named Clark had a wife 
who was a virago, and who made him miserable in life ; that he 
ascended to the top of the rock, which slightly overhangs the lake, 
jumped into the water below, and put an end to his sorrows by 
drowning himself His wife was not brokenhearted in conse- 
quence, as the story goes that when she was told of the sad 
occurrence, she coolly remarked that he had often threatened to 
make away with himself, but she never thought the fool had the 
courage to do such a thing.
A few hundred yards from Clark's Lowp, to the right, may be 
seen a dark coloured rock, known as Black Crag among the dales- 
folk.
On its smooth face, fronting to the road, are inscribed the 
initials of a few names which stand illustrious in the ranks of 
English literature.
There is "W.W.," for William Wordsworth; 
"M.H.," Mary Hutchinson; "D.W.," Dora Wordsworth; "S.T.C.," 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge; "I.W.," John Wordsworth; "S.H.," 
Sarah Hutchinson.
The initials "I.W.," above, have been under- 
stood to stand for John Wilson, also known as Christopher North, 
but there is evidence to prove they stand for John Wordsworth, 
one of the Wordsworth family.
These characters are said to have 
been carved on the rock at a time when a pic-nic was held on the 
banks of Lake Thirlmere, in which these great men and their 
friends joined.
They are still quite legible, and they serve to 
commemorate an incident in the lives of some of our greatest 
poets.
.'58 
Immediately above the meeting place of the poets, the mighty 
Helvellyn rears its huge form, towering to the sky, while directly 
in front its foot is laved by the rippling wavelets of the lake.
Its 
aspect from this point is exceedingly rugged and broken, and it 
appears to be almost entirely covered with rocks and screes.
The 
heavy downpours of rain, which are of frequent occurrence here, 
have the effect of producing, during their continuance, numberless 
streams of water, which form channels and ravines, by which the 
breast of the mountain is at this part all seamed and scarred, and 
records in the words of the poet — 
"Tl'.e history of forgotten storms 
On the blank folds inscribed of drear Helvellyn.'' 
In "Camden's Britannica," published nearly three hundred 
years ago, this mountain is named, not Helvellyn, but Lauvellin, 
its neighbour, Catchedecam, is called by the author Castinand.
He makes use of the following, which was, even then, probably an 
old rhyme — 
Skiddaw, Lauvellin, and Castinand, 
Are the highest hills in all England.
. Up to the time the height of the English mountains was taken 
by Colonel Mudge, by means of a barometer, the above-mentioned 
mountains were believed to be the highest in England.
It was 
then found that Scawfell Pike was higher than any of them.
The 
height of Helvellyn above the sea level is 3,118 feet, and it is 
almost centrally placed among the mountains of the district, and, 
to my mind, the best and most extensive views are obtained from 
its summit.
In the spring of 1805 a young gentleman lost his life, 
probably by a fall from some of the " huge nameless rocks" which 
abound there, when he was attempting to cross the mountain from 
Patterdale to Wythburn.
This incident, together with the account 
of the remarkable fidelity of his dog, are circumstances too well 
known to need repetition here.
They form the subject of very 
beautiful poems by Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott, the pathos 
of which tends to give a melancholy interest to the spot where the 
accident occurred.
no 
Further on, at the top of a hill, on the right-hand side of the 
road, is a tablet fixed in the wall, on which is inscribed an epitaph 
to a horse.
The animal thus commemorated was one of a pair of 
carriage horses belonging to the late Mr. Ball, who at that time 
lived at Rydal, and one day when that gentleman was out for a 
drive, the horse dropped down dead from the side of his fellow, 
and was afterwards buried in the adjoining wood.
On the side of 
the wall facing the road the owner subsequently erected the stone 
to the memory of his favourite horse, and on it ihscribed the 
following lines : — 
Fallen from his fellow's side, 
The steed beneath is lying ; 
In harness here he died ; 
His only fault was dying.
A few years ago some one wrote on the margin of the stone the 
following lines : — 
If dying was his only fault, 
Twas his own fault he died.
About two miles from the head of Thirlmere lake may be seen 
That pile of stones 
Heaped on brave King Dunmail's bones.
Antiquaries are by no means agreed as to the origin of this cairn.
It is said to be a record that, A.D. 945, Edmund I., the Saxon 
monarch, joined forces with Malcolm, king of Scotland, with a 
view of subjugating Dunmail, "last king of rocky Cumberland." 
This step was thought necessary for the peace of the kingdom.
The last record which legend or tradition affords us of the Cumbrian 
Britons is of their defeat between Keswick and Grasmere, in the 
heart of their native mountains, which defeat was followed by their 
final dispersion or emigration into Wales.
Edmund slew his enemy 
on the spot still commemorated by the rude pile of stones supposed 
to be his cairn; and in conformity with the barbarous customs 
of the age, put out the eyes of his two sons.
His crown of gold is 
popularly believed to have been sunk in Grisedale Tarn, which lies 
in a depression in the mountain range above.
It is said that after 
60 
the territories of Dunmail were laid waste, they were bestowed by 
Edmund on his ally Malcolm.
The circular heap of stones which forms the pile called Dunmail 
Raise, and gives its name to the mountain pass between the dales 
of Grasmere and Wythburn, is seen adjoining the high road, and is 
crossed by the wall which here marks the boundary between the 
counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.
The cairn measures 
twenty-four yards in diameter, and it rises gradually to an elevation 
of six feet.
It is flat on the top, and the centre is indicated by a 
well-defined space, of rather larger stones.
Mr. Gilpin conjectures 
it was probably intended to mark a division not between the two 
counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, but rather between the 
two kingdoms of England and Scotland in elder times, when the 
Scottish border extended its present bounds.
"The generally 
received tradition is," he adds, " that this cairn was raised to com- 
memorate the defeat of Dunmail, the last king of Cumbria on the 
occasion above related.
But," says Gilpin, "for whatever purpose 
this rude pile was fabricated, it hath yet suffered little change in 
its dimensions, and is one of those monuments of antiquity which 
may be characterised by the Scriptural phrase of remaining to this 
very day." The assertions of modern philologists seem to be at 
variance with history.
They tell us that the meaning of the 
syllables Dun-mail-raise is "heap, heap, heap," in three different 
languages or dialects ; that it is common for a modern affix to be 
added to an ancient name bearing the same signification.
It 
appears from the above that the name or names by which the 
cairn was originally known to a race of men who held the country 
for a time, was retained by their successors whose language differed 
from that of the former race.
They in turn had their own word 
for the heap, and added it to the name by which it had been 
distinguished.
In length of time we have Dunmail-raise, and in 
our own day when the cairn is spoken of as Dun Mail Raise Heap 
we make use of four words wliich have each the same meaning in 
as many different languages.
Judging from the foregoing reasons, 
it seems doubtful whether the people of Cumberland ever had a 
King Dunmail.
61 
I About a quarter of a mile from Dunmail Raise, travelling in the 
direction of Thirlmere, is a narrow road, which branches ofTto the 
right from the turnpike.
This was the old pack-horse track leading 
to the hamlet in Wythburn, called the City, and skirting the western 
side of the lake to Armboth, thence past a farm called Smea- 
thwaite, and by the upper part of Shoulthwaite Moss, where it 
again joins the main road.
The road in its present state is barely 
passable for conveyances, but it is said to be the intention of the 
Manchester Corporation to alter its primitive condition, and make 
It a good carriage road.
Very little of the lower part of Thirlmere 
IS seen from the turnpike road between Ambleside and Keswick • 
but the scenery here is grand, and will compare favourably with 
that of any part of the district.
Should the idea of making a good 
road here be carried out, we shall then have one more beautiful 
drive in the neighbourhood, which cannot fail to be appreciated 
by all who possess a taste for lake- and mountain-scenery 
Armboth, which was formerly called Low Wythburn, in the 
Manor of Wythburn, the lord of which was Sir Harry Vane till it 
was disposed of with all rights to the Corporation of Manchester 
One of estates in this Manor, anciently known as the Grange' 
belonged to the Jackson family for centuries.
Mr. Crosthw^te 
says the names of the Jacksons, of Armboth, appear in the Cros- 
thwaite parish registry from time to time since its commencement 
m the latter part of the sixteenth century.
The old farmhouse 
now standing tenantless is the place where so many generations of 
Jacksons hved and died.
Armboth House, with other estates 
bdonging the same owner, who is of the Jackson family, have 
withm the last few months also become the property of "The 
Corporation." Till quite recently it was the firm belief of many 
that the mansion was actually haunted; and wonderful are the 
stones to which the superstition of the dalesfolk has given rise 
lales are told of supernatural visitors, midnight illuminations of a 
nocturnal marriage, and a murdered bride; occurrences which 
had they really happened, would have been truly startling The 
two skulls from Calgarth Hall, near Windermere, are said to attend 
banquets at Armboth Hall, and to join in the midnight orgies The 
62 
legend of the skulls is as follows : — These skulls formerly occupied 
a niche in Calgarth Hall, from which all attempts to dispossess them 
were found futile.
They are said to have been buried, burned, 
reduced to powder, dispersed by the wind, sunk in the well, and 
thrown into the lake several times, all to no purpose.
They 
invariably appeared again in their favourite niche, till at last they 
were walled up in it, and there they remain.
At various places on the range of Armboth Fell, and especially 
on the top of Cockrigg Bank adjoining, are to be seen rude 
structures, built of stone, in the form of a parallelogram.
The 
side walls are generally nine or ten yards in length, those across 
the end three-and-a-half or four yards.
There is an aperture in 
the side wall of each which seems to have been the entrance.
The 
height of the walls varies from two or three feet, some of the 
enclosed spaces having two or three divisions inside.
They have 
been visited by several people, some of whom have given the 
opinion that they were simply places to store peat ; others suppose 
that they were constructed for sheepfolds.
Knowing all about 
cutting and storing peat on the fell, I am certain, from the situ- 
ations in which we find them, that they cannot have been of any 
use to those who procured peats from the fell ; and anyone who 
has had experience among sheep, must know them to be utterly 
useless as sheepfolds.
It is an idea of those who have lately 
visited these ancient remains, that they have probably at one time 
been used as human habitations, and as far as I am able to 
judge there has been, up to the present time, no argument brought 
forward to disprove this view of the matter.
A rock, called Castle Crag, is situate near Shoulthwaite Gill, 
and not far distant from Raven Crag.
There is every reason to 
believe that this situation has at one time been used as a fortress.
The front of the rock, which is almost perpendicular, is of con- 
siderable height, and faces the valley below.
Such is the formation 
of the top of the rock and the ground adjoining that a considerable 
space has at one time been enclosed by two earthworks, one some 
distance in front of the other.
This place is sufficiently large to 
have held a considerable body of men, who at the time it was in 
63 
use would be well protected from enemies on all sides.
To what 
period of history this ancient fort belongs, or to what race of men 
it afforded protection, I leave for those to decide who are more 
deeply versed than myself in antiquarian lore.
But it does seem 
to me that the existence of this fort strengthens the idea which 
has been formed in reference to the remains to which I have just 
previously referred.
In those early days, when the laws concerning 
property were summed up in that 
Simple plan.
That they should take who have the power, 
And they should keep who can, 
every man would have to bear his part in the constant brunt of 
battle.
The arts of peace were not congenial studies for our early 
predecessors, especially the Celts, who are stated to have been 
feeble in disposition, warlike, vain, boastful, and clamorous.
On 
these grounds, then, it is possible the fort would be the rallying 
place of the people of the dale when attacked in greater numbers 
than themselves, and their hope of safety when retreating from a 
hot pursuit, after some of their forays among the cattle and stores 
of their more wealthy neighbours.
Deer Garth Gill is a mountain stream which forms the division 
line between Wythburn and Armboth, which are both in the same 
township.
This stream, which flows out of Lanchy Tarn on the 
fell above, in its passage down the hill side passes at different 
places through deep gorges in the rocks, and at some points where 
it flows sheer over a precipice it forms beautiful cascades.
There 
is a roughish footpath leading up to Armboth Fell, alongside the 
gill, and the scenery immediately around is exceedingly wild and 
picturesque.
On a slight eminence, to the left of this path, near 
Bull Crag, is a stone of large dimensions, which somewhat resem- 
bles the Bowder Stone, in Borrowdale, and which stands on so 
small a base that it seems almost possible to push it over.
It is 
known to the dalesfolk by the name of " Cop Stone," and is 
sometimes visited as a natural curiosity, but I have never heard of 
any legend or tradition about it.
64 
In the olden times spinning and weaving were some of the 
principal occupations of the dalesfolk; and there is a tradition 
that when the plague raged in the year 1665 and a few years 
afterwards, as no market was held in towns for fear of infection, 
the people of the dales carried their webs and yarn to a large 
stone which is very conspicuous on one of the lower elevations of 
Armboth Fell, and there periodically met and did business with 
the traders.
This stone, which still goes by the name of " Web 
Stone," is a little over a mile distant from the "Cop Stone" before 
mentioned, and is perched on a hill just above Lanchy Tarn.
Close to the road between Wythburn and Armboth, and a few 
hundred yards south of Deer Garth Gill, is a part of the fell called 
Deer Garth Bottom, and here may be seen a large grey stone 
having a sloping flat top.
Around this stone, called the "Steading 
Stone," tradition says manorial courts were formerly held, and 
other parish business transacted.
Whether they were framed here 
or elsewhere I have no means of ascertaining ; but there is still in 
existence a copy of the bye-laws of that ancient parish parliament, 
which is entitled the "Pains and Penalties of Wythburn." This 
gives a list of small penalties to be paid by anyone who turns out 
more sheep on the fell than he is justly entitled to from the number 
of stints he possesses on farms.
There are penalties for allowing 
horses and cattle to stray on the road and for defiling the beck by 
throwing dead carcases into it, etc.
A copy of this document is 
at present in the possession of Mr. Graves, ex-mayor of Man- 
chester.
During the summer of 1877 the late Mr. Alfred Pettitt executed 
six magnificent pictures of Thirlmere and its surroundings.
One 
of the pictures, taken when the artist has been seated under the 
shadow of Raven Crag, embraces the whole length of the lake.
Another gives a view of the old Celtic bridge.
The other pictures 
represent the lake from various aspects, and the artist was careful 
to introduce in the foregrounds of his pictures objects which are 
expected to be forever submerged when the lake is enlarged.
If 
these pictures are carefully preserved they will possess special 
interest to future generations who may be connected with Thirlmere 
6.1 
after its boundaries are extended ; and a good idea of the scenery, 
as we have viewed it to-day, may be gained by a careful study of 
Mr. Pettitt's excellent delineations.* 
* A series of good photographs, taken with the special object of recording 
the present aspect of Thirlmere and its surroundings, has already been secured, 
for the same reason.

WHO WAS THE FOUNDER OF ROMAN MARYPORT?
Cy J.
B. BAILEY.
(Read before the Maryport Society.) 
I AM sure no apology will be necessary in introducing the question, 
" Who was the Founder of Roman Maryport ?
" That it has been 
a notable place, no one can dare to doubt.
The period during 
which it existed, if it did not also flourish, makes it clear that it 
had played a not unimportant part, at least in the history of Cum- 
berland.
Founded in all probability within forty years alter the 
invasion of Britain by xAulus Plautius, we can almost with certainty 
say that it was in existence in A.D. 430, i.e., when the Romans 
finally left Britain.
Nor are we necessarily to infer that the town 
ceased to exist with their withdrawal.
Still, there is matter enough 
at hand in the history of its Roman occupation to afford, not only 
a deeply interesting and instruciive, but also a highly fascinating 
study; and naturally so, for a certain amount of pride always 
attaches to those places with which we are best acquainted.
Nor 
can the subject be exhausted in the brief space of an hour's lecture.
To do justice to the subject would require at least four such 
lectures, or, including the rise and progress of our modern Maryport, 
of at least five, each lecture forming a distinct chapter in the history 
of Maryport.
Briefly these chapters are : — 
Chapter i.
The Camp, its Situation and Connections; the 
Town, its Explorations, Position, &c.; the Altars, and their 
Lessons.
68 
Chapter 2 might well be devoted to a discussion as to the 
Founder of the Camp.
Chapter 3 would be taken up with the Name of the station.
Chapter 4 might treat of Medieval Maryport, as represented 
by a History of Netherhall.
Chapter 5 would comprise the Rise and Progress of our 
Modern Maryport.
Chapter i, I have already dealt with fully, whilst Chapters 4 
and 5 have been touched on in a brief sort of way.
With regard 
to Chapter 3, a highly interesting, though, at the same time a most 
intricate subject, requires treatment.
Many of our leading anti- 
quarians give the name as Axelodunum ; but opinion upon the 
subject is by no means unanimous.
Chapter 2 forms the subject for to-night's consideration ; and I 
think that I may anticipate the conclusions to which I have 
arrived, viz., that Agricola was founder of the Camp — a Camp, the 
position of which is so admirably chosen, apd its treasures the 
envy of all lovers of antiquity.
To us Agricola appears as a man 
amongst men — one who dared to be virtuous when to be so was 
looked upon as almost a crime ; a wise ruler, a kind friend, a 
devoted husband, a loving father, a giant among the famous in 
war ; — well may we wish to claim such a man as the founder of 
our Camp.
Of course it is not my present intention to treat 
exhaustively of his life and character; but I shall confine myself 
to bringing out such points as will be useful in the consideration of 
the question before us, basing my argument in the main upon the 
statements of Tacitus the historian, and the son-in-law of Agricola.
Cnseus Julius Agricola was a native of the Roman colony of 
Forojulium, (near the present Toulon,) in the S.E. of Gaul, being 
born A.D. 40.
His father, Julius Grgecinus, was celebrated for 
his proficiency in eloquence and philosophy, and by these qualifi- 
cations drew upon himself the enmity of the Emperor.
Seneca 
says of him, " If we need the example of a great and exalted mind 
let us imitate Julius Grtecinus, that excellent man whom Caius 
69 
Caesar (Caligula) put to death, for no other reason than because He 
had more virtue than a tyrant could endure." He wrote treatises 
on husbandry, and his delight in agriculture is supposed to have 
led him to give the name of Agricola to his son.
His mother 
was Julia Procilla.
Under her tender and loving care he passed 
his childhood and youth in the acquirement of every liberal 
accomplishment.
His mind was almost entirely moulded by her.
But for his mother's judgment, Agricola is reported to have said 
that he would have pursued the study of philosophy more ardently 
than suited a Roman and a senator.
Thus, what England owes to 
Agricola, that it owes to his mother in the beginning.
He began his military career in Britain, being appointed on the 
staff of Suetonius Paulinus, the governor from A.D. 59—62.
To the 
majority of young men, such an appointment was looked upon 
merely in the light of a time for dissipation, professional ignorance, 
and sensuality.
Not so to .Agricola.
He came for a set purpose, 
and the distracted state of Britain at that time afforded splendid 
opportunities for the development of his character.
He at once 
set himself the task of thoroughly knowing and being known by 
the army — a no^easy task when so much jealousy reigned in high 
quarters.
'£ No service was solicited by him through mere osten- 
tation ; he shrank from no duty through timidity ; and he acted 
always with zeal and diligence, endeavouring to emulate the most 
distinguished, and to derive instruction from the experienced.
One 
great aim of his life was to become thoroughly acquainted with the 
country, hence aj troublesome campaign imparted skill and en- 
couragement to Agricola, and a passion for military distinction 
took possession of his mind.
The important events commencing with the attack on the Isle 
of Mona (now Anglesea), and culminating with the defeat of 
Boadicea, could not fail to prepare him for his future glorious 
career.
On the conclusion of the campaign he returned to Rome, 
and shortly afterwards married Domitia Decidiana — a lady of high 
rank.
Tacitus the historian, who married their daughter, tells us 
that their married life was one of perfect harmony, and of mutual 
preference for each other ; and this, for the times, was saying a great 
70 
deal.
Under Salvius Titianus the proconsul, Agricola served in 
Asia.
Here he might have made a splendid competency by 
listening to the dishonest overtures of his chief; but, true to his 
principles, he refused to be led into wrong doing.
After honourably 
passing through one or two other offices, he sustained a great loss 
in the death of his mother, she having been murdered, and her 
lands plundered, by Otho.
On the way to fulfil the duties of filial 
affection, he heard of the accession of Vespasian, and immediately 
joined his party, and was by him appointed to the command of 
the 2oth legion then in Britain.
This legion, although it had been 
slow in coming to its allegiance, .Agricola soon succeeded in sub- 
duing by a most singular exercise of moderation.
The government 
of Vettius Bolanus (A.D. 69) was of too mild a nature to afford 
Agricola any opportunity of showing his rare talents.
Under Petilius Cerealis — an old friend — his merits were fully 
put to the test.
There was no jealousy between them, and Cerealis 
readily shared not only the hardships and the dangers with him, 
but also the glory.
When sent out in command of a portion of 
the army, .Agricola never boasted of his success, attributing it rather 
to his superior.
Thus, by his intrepidity in performing services, 
and his extreme modesty in speaking of them, he escaped jealousy 
and attained renown.
Most of their campaigns seem to have been 
amongst the Brigantes.
How thoroughly they performed their 
work Tacitus distinctly tells us, for he says that Cerealis, "in order 
to spread a general terror, fell with sudden fury on the Brigantes, 
so that the greatest part of that extensive country was either subdued 
or else involved in all the calamities of war."* 
On his return to Rome from the command of the legion, Ves- 
pasian elevated him to patrician rank, and then appointed him to 
the government of Aquitania.
This was a most honourable 
appointment, and preparatory to the office of consul, for which he 
was intended ; and well was he fitted for the office, for in all things 
his natural judgment was to be relied on, and a systematic arrange- 
ment of his work was the leading feature of his rule.
He was 
dignified, unremitting, austere, when the tribunals claimed his 
* C.
C. Taciti Agricola, cap.
xvii.
71 
attendance, but, business concluded, he laid aside his gravity, his 
airs of state, and severity of exaction.
Nor at any time did his 
affability interfere with his authority, nor his austerity repel 
affection.
After three years he was recalled, and the rumour was 
circulated that, as consul, Britain would be given to him as a 
province, a position for which his great and varied talents emi- 
nently fitted him.
Nor was the rumour an idle one.
Agricola 
was appointed to the military command in Britain, A.D. 78 ; great 
expectations being entertained of his success in this capacity.
How he fulfilled these expectations is a matter of history.
In 
short, he had many very able predecessors, but the lustre of his 
name outshines them all.
Landing at midsummer of the year 78, he found everything 
unfitted for a renewal of hostilities.
The troops had given them- 
selves up to a careless repose, an opportunity thus offering itself 
to the Ordovices, of which they were not slow to avail themselves, 
cutting off an entire battalion of cavalry just before the arrival of 
Agricola.
The officers naturally expected that Agricola's first 
measure would be the strengthening of the various posts prepara- 
tory to retiring into winter quarters.
But Agricola well knew the 
value of decision in this crisis, and that any want of it might be 
dangerous in the face of a triumphant and expectant enemy.
Making a hasty but thorough preparation, he marched against the 
Ordovices who lived in North Wales.
They evidently were not 
prepared for such a vigorous policy, as they refused to meet him in 
the plain.
His was no timid caution, so with every confidence in his men, 
he followed the enemy into their native fastnesses, exterminating 
almost the whole tribe.
Following up his success, he quickly reduced the Isle of Mona 
(Anglesea), and, on the solicitation of the inhabitants, gave them 
peace.
Then he gave his army rest for the winter — a time he 
himself occupied in making preparations for the next summer's 
campaign.
Having been taught by experience that he could gain but little 
advantage if oppression followed his victories, and knowing 
72 
further, "that the Britons cheerfully submitted to conscription, 
taxes, and other imposts, provided that injustice be withheld,"* he 
resolved to eradicate all provocation to rebellion.
The necessary 
reforms were initiated in his own household, and were then 
extended to the army, and equally to the defeated Britons.
The 
latter had been at the mercy of various governors, who had made 
laws with regard to the payment of tribute and other matters which 
were most irritating to the defeated Britons.
All this Agricola 
altered, especially providing against the extortion of the tax-gatherer, 
which was more odious and intolerable than the tax itself By these 
means he thus early acquired a favourable character for peace — a 
most important consideration in view of his second campaign, and 
one likely to greatly aid in bringing it to a successful issue ; for a 
report of his terrible vengeance in battle, his clemency to those 
who submitted to his rule, and, above all, his evident wish to treat 
them fairly and considerately, would doubtless precede him.
Nor 
were active preparations for an advance in the following spring 
delayed.
Such preparations were doubtless made at Deva (Chester).
What the nature of these was, the brevity of Tacitus does not 
supply; but we may be quite sure that the experience gained 
during his previous campaigns under Cerealis amongst the Brig- 
antes, would be largely turned to account.
As soon as possible, 
an advance was made "in quest of the enemy;" but in what 
direction such advance was made, affords much room for specu- 
lation.
Probably he went by way of Mancunium (Manchester), 
and so through the almost trackless wilds to Lancaster.
Here 
troubles and anxieties would meet him, for he was now on the 
confines of a mountainous district, with two distinct routes in his 
front, viz., one by the sea-coast of Cumberland, the other an inland 
route.
Much may be said both for and against each of these 
routes ; but we may rest assured that Agricola would not commit 
himself to either till he had fully considered both.
Nor would his 
decision be long delayed, otherwise it might have been taken as a 
sign of weakness by his enemies.
His quickness of perception, as 
exhibited in his first campaign, would enable him to act with 
* C.
Comelii Taciti Agricola, cap.
xix.
73 
decision, and we may be certain that he would strike out with 
energy.
Regarding this campaign, Tacitus remarks,* "loca castris 
ipse capere, aestuaria ac silvas ipse praetentare," from which we 
are to understand that, like a prudent general, he himself selected 
the ground for his encampments, and, ere the army advanced, he 
searched or examined the estuaries and woods.
In this we see 
reason to believe that his advance was by the West coast, and not 
by the East, as some think, there being no likely estuaries on the 
East coast.
The object of such searching was, of course, to see 
whether the woods contained a hidden foe, or whether the estuaries 
were passable for his army ; such estuaries being doubtless those 
comprising the present Morecambe Bay, with possibly those of the 
Dee, Mersey, and Ribble.
But the fact of his having sounded the 
estuaries, does not necessarily prove that the army crossed them.
Surely if his reconnaissance across the estuaries were unfavourable, 
no such crossing would take place.
He could not but notice that 
the rapidly rising tide, together with the treacherous sands, would 
prove a great obstacle in the way of his advance, as also of a safe 
retreat in case of defeat.
How dangerous such a road would be 
may be understood when we refer to the terrible disaster that 
overtook King John nearly 1140 years later, when crossing the 
Wash, the counterpart of Morecambe.
Besides, such dangers 
would be greatly increased in the face of a triumphant enemy.
It 
is true that whilst addressing his army before the battle of the 
Grampians, A.D. 84, Agricola speaks of their having crossed 
estuaries — " Nam ut superasse tantum itineris, silvas evasisse, 
transisse aestuaria."t 
But it seems probable that such statement can only apply to his 
campaigns in Caledonia, for he went on to say that, " in the event 
of defeat, these, together with the fens and mountains, would prove 
most serious dangers." Surely there would be safety behind his 
line of camps stretched from Clota (Clyde) to Bodotria (Forth), or 
those from Tyne to Solway, for that they were strongly placed and 
well provisioned, we may be quite sure, for Tacitus boasts that 
none of Agricola's camps had ever been taken by the enemy.
* C.
Cornelii Taciti Agricola, cap.
xx.
+ Ibid., cap.
xxxiiL 
74 
Besides, in the second campaign, we are told that he examined the 
estuaries, but in the sixth, that he crossed, the Latin terms being 
different in each case.
Thus, in describing the events of the 
second campaign, the Latin verb is pretentare, i.e., to search or 
examine previously, or beforehand ; whilst the action in the sixth 
campaign is denoted by the word transisse, i.e., to cross, to pass 
over.
Surely such use of these two terms is not an accidental one.
Hence we seem driven to the conclusion that if he crossed the 
estuaries in the second campaign, the army certainly did not.
If 
this be so, it is fatal to the coast route.
Still, such a road might 
have been made secure had no other road been feasible ; but in no 
case could it have been considered safe without precautions having 
been taken to keep open his communications.
Such would seem 
to have necessitated a camp at least on the side of the estuary 
opposite to Lancaster.
So far as we know, there is no evidence of such a camp ; nor 
can we suppose that Agricola would advance with the intention of 
making a hasty camp in case of retreat.
He could not be sure 
that there would be time for this.
Nothing would be left to 
chance, for, under Petilius Cereaiis, he had learnt not to despise 
his enemies.
And yet again, it may be said that even with all these incon- 
veniences, he would choose this route, as he would then be in no 
difficulty with regard to provisions.
This, of course, necessitates 
his being accompanied by a fleet, or, at any rate, being in a position 
to easily communicate with one.
But are we certain that a fleet 
did accompany him ?
Mr. W.
Thomson \A'atkin, a great authority 
in all that pertains to antiquarian lore, says that there was no fleet 
on this coast till at any rate three years later, i.e., A.D. 82.* If 
we can prove this point, then we shall have to abandon the coast 
route.
In the account of the sixth campaign, we meet with the following 
statement: — "Portus classe exploravit.
Quae ab Agricola primum 
assumpta in partem virium ;" i.e., he explored the harbours, (viz., 
those on the East coast of Caledonia,) with his fleet, which was 
* Manchester Guardian, April 10, 1882.
75 
then first employed by him as a portion of his forces.
But this is 
not the first time he mentions ships ; he names them in the first 
campaign, but merely to offer an excuse for their omission.
Again, 
during the fifth campaign we find, "nave prima transgressus," a 
statement that certainly admits of several interpretations.
How- 
ever, following, amongst others, the views of Mr. W.
T. Watkin, it 
would seem that we are to understand that Agricola crossed the 
estuary of^the Clota (Clyde) "in the first Roman ship that had 
been seen in these waters." Probably he so advanced, the army 
following by land.
Nor is it at all likely that any great number of 
vessels appeared in the Clyde during the fifth campaign, for we 
meet with the following statement during the recital of the oper- 
ations of the sixth campaign : — " Britannos quoque, ut ex captivis 
audiebatur, visa classis obstupefaciebat ;" i.e., that the Britons 
were astounded at the sight of the fleet.
Doubtless they saw that 
now their chances of safety were greatly lessened, when they could 
be attacked on land or sea alike.
It is quite clear that the terror 
of Agricola's power preceded him ; but we are not told till this 
campaign that any part of such fear was occasioned by the use of 
ships.
Clearly then no large fleet could have been gathered 
together in the Clyde during the fifth campaign, or the terror 
occasioned by its presence during the sixth campaign would have 
been shown during the fifth campaign, the distance between the 
Clota (Clyde) and Bodotria (Forth) being so very short.
It being thus clear that ships are regularly named in the 
account of the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh campaigns — and 
particularly fully in the sixth — it would appear strange that there 
is no mention of them in the second, supposing them to have been 
used.
Such omission seems to prove that they were not used in 
the second campaign, and the more as he excuses their omission 
in the first campaign.
Nor does there seem any likelihood that Agricola would calculate 
upon the necessity for ships.
Granted that when he went " in 
quest of the enemy," he was going amongst the Sestuntii, he would 
doubtless make use of the information gained regarding this tribe 
during his campaigns amongst the Brigantes under Cerealis.
Such 
76 
information would connect them, not with the sea, but with the 
mountain fastnesses beyond Stainmore.
Nor would it be likely 
that a fleet would accompany him for any purpose, till he had 
gained a better acquaintance with the country.
Hence it would seem as though Agricola did not go by the 
coast.
That there was a coast road, at any rate in later times, we 
cannot deny ; but we must not, therefore, necessarily assume that 
Agricola made it, any more than the presence of a road through 
the Tebay valley proves that he made that.
Granted that there is so strong a case against the probability of 
a coast road, we shall have to try to ascertain whether so strong a 
case can be made out in favour of an inland route.
Of course, 
the arguments used against the coast road, themselves tell strongly, 
if indirectly, in favour of an inland route.
Still, we want other 
and more direct proof 
We have seen that during his sixth campaign, "fearing, in a 
country not yet explored, the dangers of a surprise, Agricola 
ordered his ships to sail across the gulf, and gain some knowledge 
of these new regions." When we consider that the circumstances 
attending the second and the sixth campaigns were almost identical, 
it seems strange that such information should only be given during 
the recital of the operations of the sixth campaign, supposing him 
to have had ships during the second campaign.
It would almost 
seem to point clearly to the fact that he did not in his second 
campaign go by a country "not yet explored," but that he went by 
a country already explored, or, at any rate, so tolerably well known 
as to need no great amount of preliminary reconnoitring.
If this be correct, which is this country ?
It is quite certain 
that during the time of Cartismandua, the part of the Brigantine 
territory to the east of the Pennines, at least, would be well known 
to the Romans ; additional means of becoming further acquainted 
with the same district being gained by Cerealis and his friend and 
co-leader Agricola, for we are told that "he subdued and overcame 
a considerable portion of the Brigantes." 
It seems only natural that, as his intention was to add to the 
empire, he would do this in the most systematic manner, and this by 
adding to it from the limits of what had been already overcome.
Over a certain part, the Romans had either real or nominal 
authority, and it appears likely that where such authority termin- 
ated, there they would be most likely to commence adding to the 
empire.
That the Sestuntii had been conquered is improbable, 
and the following statement may be in part applicable to them :— 
"Quibus rebus multae civitates, quae in ilium diem ex aequo 
egerant, datis obsidibus iram posuere, et praesidiis castellisque 
circumdatae."* The connecting link between the Brigantine 
territory with that of the Sestuntii, was the famous strategic pass of 
Stainmore.
This pass would doubtless be well known to Agricola, 
who, we know, took every opportunity of thoroughly studying the 
topographical details of a country.
Its possession, as we shall see, 
would be of immense benefit to him, hence we may safely assume 
that his first aim was in that direction.
Such a course must necessarily lead him by the valley of the 
Lune, and so through the Tebay gorge.
It is true that an advance 
might have been made by way of Kendal and Ambleside, but it 
does not appear that this would have been such a favourable route 
as that by the Lune valley, as being a country "not yet explored." 
Still, he would doubtless make one of his " sudden incursions " in 
that direction, and so prepare for future developments.
The Lune valley undoubtedly had its disadvantages, but these 
were probably more than counteracted by its advantages.
His 
right flank would be practically safe, and he would be in a position 
to readily receive supplies.
It must be remembered that the 
Brigantes under Cartismandua had been in alliance with the 
Romans, whilst at a later period, A.D. 70 and 71, they had felt 
the full power of the Roman arms under Cerealis and Agricola- 
Hence the latter was well known to them, and the rumour that 
would reach them of his clemency to the people of the Isle of 
Mona (Anglesea), and his terrible punishment of the Ordovices, 
could not but confirm the opinions that they had already formed.
They well knew that he was not to be trifled with ; and at the same 
time they knew that they might expect fair and honourable treat- 
* C.
Cornelii Taciti .\giicola, cap.
xx.
ment at his hands.
Nor would they in any case be likely to risk 
the chances of a rising against him.
In the third campaign we are 
told that so great was the terror of his name> that the Britons 
dared not hazard an engagement with the Romans.
If this were 
so amongst those who had barely seen him, how much greater 
would be the terror amongst those in whose midst he had been for 
so long a time ?
Thus a kind of friendship would exist so long as 
Agricola's power was felt, and this would doubtless provide him so 
far with needful supplies — a fact he could scarcely count on had 
he gone by the coast road, unless indeed we can show that he was 
accompanied by ships.
It may be thus seen that he would not therefore necessarily 
place himself between two enemies.
Besides, it is clear that 
although the Britons were slow in coming to the idea that their 
strength consisted in their unity, still tlie value of union was not 
altogether unknown amongst them, and especially amongst the 
Brigantes.
Thus he could not be certain that the eastern Brigantes 
would remain neutral whilst he fought their western brethren, the 
Sestuntii.
Had he gone by the coast road, he knew not but that 
an alliance might be made against him.
However, by going 
through the Lune valley, such a contingency was entirely prevented, 
and his position strengthened thereby.
Besides, the Ordovices 
had refused to meet him in the plain ; if the Sestuntii had likewise 
refused to meet him, it is difficult to see how he could have con- 
quered them by making a parade round their district; — sooner or 
later he would have to go amongst them.
He would therefore, 
doubtless, go to the root of the matter, and attack them in their 
own fastnesses, and at the earliest opportunity.
This could best 
be done by the inland route, for he would then have the advantage 
of position in his "sudden incursions," which could thus be made 
to the right and left of his line of advance down into the enemy's 
country.
And again : after a time he would have the advantage of a 
known road.
True, this was only a British trackway; still, following 
even this, his advance would necessarily be more rapid than if he 
crossed the "trackless wikl." 
79 
And yet again, such a route was essentially Roman — straight 
ahead.
It might be said that the nature of the Tebay valley was 
such as would deter Agricola from choosing this route ; but, after 
all, it would be a comparatively easy passage, if such precautions 
were taken as might be necessary to prevent a flank movement.
The character of the hill sides is such as would be of equal advan- 
tage to Agricola in repelling an attack, as it was to the Britons in 
making one.
Even granted that such a road was a difficult one, 
and that an advance would have to be made with extreme caution, 
we must remember that this was one of iVgricola's characteristics ; 
nor was it a caution arising from timidity, for to his caution was 
added a clear insight into every difficulty, and an intrepidity in 
action which would carry him through with success.
Nor would 
he refuse this road and choose the coast road merely on account 
of its difficulty.
When the terrible Khyber Pass, defended by 
arms of precision, could be so easily forced, surely such a paltry 
one as the Tebay gorge sinks into insignificance.
Nor would the pass be favourable to the Britons.
They could 
not attack in force, whilst their long pointless swords, and their 
chariots, would be of little use in so confined a space.
That the Romans did use the pass in later, and probably more 
troublous times, is shown by the military road passing through it ; 
and that its possession was looked upon as necessary, is shown by 
their having placed a strong camp at Borrow Bridge, almost within 
the jaws of the pass — a fact that goes fiir to prove that there was 
no difficulty other than ordinary in keeping the communication 
open.
Granted then that his advance was made by the Lune valley — 
when at Tebay, being within measurable distance of a known part 
of the country, his scouts would be able to penetrate to Brough 
and to Kirkbythore, at both of which places he would be on the 
British trackway before mentioned, whilst at Penrith he would be 
able to strike right into the heart of the country.
From Kirkbythore, the exact track of his advance to the isthmus 
between Tyne and Solway is doubtful.
He might have gone by 
what is now the Maiden Way, which passed Kirkbythore, running 
80 
north past Whitley Castle, and so on past Bewcastle.
It is 
more likely, however, to suppose that he went by the British 
trackway, afterwards a part of the second iter of Antonine, to 
the neighbourhood of Carlisle, where preparations would have to 
be made for his advance during the next summer — AD.
80.
Two very important matters here required his urgent attention, 
viz :— First, the securing of his conquests, which he did by drawing 
a line of forts from the Tyne to the Solway, as already mentioned.
Such forts would not only protect his rear, but also serve as rallying 
points in case of defeat.
The second great consideration was the 
supply of provisions.
He would, of course, find greater difficulty 
in securing an ample supply of provisions the further he removed 
from his base, and this even supposing everything to be tranquil in 
his rear.
In case of defeat, the most disastrous results were to be 
anticipated ; for, as Agricola tells us in his address to his soldiers 
before the battle of the Grampians, "our present greatest advantages 
would become our most serious dangers on a retreat ; because we 
have not the same acquaintance with the localities, or the same 
supply of provisions.
' " For my own part, I have been long 
convinced that a retreat is unsafe, both for troops and com- 
mander."* 
Hence a thorough preparation was necessary.
Each day would 
take him to a greater distance from friends, who might be his 
enemies in case of defeat.
Hence he could not trust to their 
friendship when his presence was removed, and for this reason he 
must have absolute certainty as to his supplies ere he moved 
from his winter quarters.
Nothing could be left to chance.
But here an opportunity presents itself of supplying these from 
an independent base, and, like a skilful and prudent general, he 
would doubtless avail himself of it.
No one knew better than 
himself how to seize upon the most fitting positions.
In the 
neighbourhood of the sea, with a new campaign opening out, what 
more natural than the seeking out of the most likely place for a 
port.
Such port must be so situated as to afford ready means of 
transit, not only "to the front," but also to the various camps 
* C.
C. Taciti Agricola, cap.
xxxiii.
81 
stretched between the Tyne and the Sol way, which appear to have 
been supplied with provisions for twelve months.
It might appear 
that this supply of provisions was an immense one — much greater, 
in fact, than any convoys could bring up, especially considering 
the character of the country through which they would have to 
travel.
Thus the necessity for a port is strengthened.
Could the 
magnificent position of Maryport escape his notice ?
No place 
could better supply his wants, either as an outlook or as a base for 
future operations.
Nor was it a place that could easily be taken 
by surprise, either by land or by sea.
The claims of Bowness must, of course, be considered.
The 
position of this place, so close to the Scotch borders, would render 
it easily assailable by the Britons after Agricola's advance, whilst 
its use as a port was also on this account greatly lessened.
Again, 
a line from Maryport to Carlisle would be more easily defended, 
with a bog in front of it, than one from Bowness to Carlisle, with 
a bog behind it, would have been.
It might appear as though the 
latter line were drawn to supersede the former when the country 
"across the border" had become somewhat more settled.
If, then, it be granted that the original line of defence ran from 
Maryport to Tynemouth, the importance of the former will be 
greatly advanced.
It would, in fact, be the key to the eastward 
communications.
In time of war, its importance cannot be over- 
rated ; for against a resolute enemy the Tebay pass must always 
be a difficult and dangerous one, for convoys at least.
Could 
Agricola overlook this fact ?
Maryport being held, the necessity 
for such convoys was almost done away with, the various camps 
being supplied direct from this port.
The number of camps in 
the immediate neighbourhood, and the net-work of roads, not to 
tell of the immense quantity of remains that have been discovered 
at one time or another, also bear unmistakeable testimony to the 
value of such a position.
That Maryport, whatever may have been its name, was a port — 
and a very important one — at a very early date, we have indirect 
evidence.
Within forty years from the date of Agricola's advance, 
we gather that a cohort of Spaniards was in garrison here.
This 
7 
82 
cohort was apparently commanded by Marcus Msnius Agrippa, 
who, we are told on the authority of Dr. J.
Colling^vood Bruce, 
was none other than the admiral of the Roman fleet, and a friend 
of Hadrian, the reigning emperor.
In passing we may, with a very great degree of probability, 
fancy that Hadrian, the prince of pedestrians, had visited his friend 
when in camp here.
That a strong friendship existed between the 
two, we may be certain.
Of four altars that have been found 
dedicated by Agrippa, two are dedicated to Jupiter, and the other 
two to Jupiter and the divine influences of the emperor.
That Agrippa should have been in command, shows how very 
greatly the Romans esteemed the possession of this station.
Had 
it been a place of small importance, we can scarcely conceive that 
so important a personage would have been in command.
Hence, 
at a very early date — about A.D. 120 — we may perhaps look upon 
Maryport as one of the chief stations of the Roman fleet on the 
west coast.
Granted then that I have not spoken too favourably of the 
camp, etc., and granting too, that in the selection of his posts 
Agricola made at all times a wise selection, I think we may safely 
assume that Agricola was the founder of Roman Maryport, about 
the year A.D. 79.

WILD FLOWERS AROUND CARLISLE.
Part I.
By W .
DUCKWORTH.
(Read at Carlisle.
) 
Commencing with the Buttercup or Crowfoot Order, Ranuncu- 
LACE/E, (and here I may observe that I am following in this paper 
the classification of orders as set down in Hayward's " Botanist's 
Pocket Book,") we find the Wood Anemone, or Flower of the Wind, 
Anemone nemorosa, common in our damp woods and many of 
our meadows, noticeably near Carleton.
A much rarer species, 
and one which has not been included in any of the lists published 
in the Transactions, is the Meadow Rue, Thalidrum fiavum, 
which grows near to the Fish-house on Stainton Banks.
Of the 
Buttercups or Crowfoots proper, we have no less than ten species, 
the particular ones being the Celery-Leaved Crowfoot, Ranunculus 
scderatus, a water- or ditch-loving plant, with very inconspicuous 
flowers, found near the Caledonian Railway Sheds, and on the road 
side opposite Kingmoor House; the Lesser Spearvvort, R.flammula, 
on Kingmoor; the Pale Hairy Crowfoot, R.
hirsutus, on the 
Rockcliff road ; Goldilocks, R.
auricomus, AVetheral and Cummers- 
dale ; Monk's Hood, Aconitum napellus, a common garden plant, 
and a very poisonous one, in Blackball wood.
The Marsh 
Marigold, Caltha palustris, Shakespeare's "Cuckoo Buds of Yellow 
hue," common in damp meadows and sides of water-courses.
The 
very handsome Globe Flower, Trollius europaus, by the side of 
the Eden between Wetheral and Warwick, and also at Cummers- 
dale.
84 
The Barberry, Berberis vulgaris, the only British plant in its 
order, and noted for the tonic properties of its bark, grows about 
Kingmoor House and Cumwhinton Lonning.
The White Water Lily, Nytnphcea alba, at Moss Pool; the 
Yellow one, N.
liitea, in Brunstock Beck.
The former is often 
referred to by botanists when evolution is talked about, as showing 
the gradual transformation of stamens into petals.
Two of the Poppies are common with us, the Long Smooth- 
headed, Papaver dubiutn, and the Common Red, P.
rhceas.
Cheli- 
donium, or Celandine, C.
majus, a plant full of a thick yellow 
juice, said to be effective in the curing of warts, may be found in 
a hedge near St. Ann's, and other places ; generally near houses.
Of the Fumitory order, leaving out the common ones, which are 
to be found in every cornfield, we have in one of the Stainton 
lanes the White Climbing Corydalis, C.
daviculata ; while the 
Yellow one, C.
lutea, seems to have naturalised itself about some 
garden walls in Stanwix.
Among the order CruciferjE, the Shepherd's Purse is every- 
where met with in its infinite variety of forms, from a dwarfed 
specimen an inch or two in height on a dry wall, to one as many 
feet in rich soil.
In this plant is found occasionally the rare 
occurrence of petals reverting to stamens, and that you must look 
for on very poor plants.
Scurvy Grass, Cochleria officinalis, is to 
be found about Rockcliffe, common by the sides of creeks on the 
marsh ; the Large-Flowered Bitter Cress, Cardamine amara, on the 
Scar and Stainton Banks ; the Cuckoo Flower or Ladies' Smock, 
"all silver white," in all our damp meadows ; the Water Cress, 
Nasturtium officinalis, is common, and the Marsh Yellow Cress, 
N. palustre, in a pond near the Midland Railway Station at 
Scotby.
The Wallflower, Cheiranthus cheiri, on the cliffs at Rockcliff is 
very fine ; and the walls of our own Castle used to be a station for 
it.
In an old book, written about 1819 or 1820, containing an 
account of an American's rambles in this part of Britain, the writer 
says, speaking of Carlisle Castle, " The matted ivy is seen creeping 
over its walls in wildest luxuriance, as if to conceal the ravages 
85 
which time and tempest are continually augmenting ; and along its 
ramparts the rank grass grows profusely, interspersed with number- 
less wallflowers, which are now in perfection, and exhale the 
choicest fragrance." 
The Dyer's Weed, Reseda luteola, and Wild Mignonette, R.
lutea, 
may be found near the Caledonian Railway Sheds.
The Scented 
Violet, Viola odorata, the Violet of Shakspeare, I have found 
growing by the roadside near Blackball, while the white variety is 
abundant about Cummersdale.
Of the Sundews we have the Round-Leaved or Common one, 
Drosera rotundifolia, on Kingmoor, where it has increased very 
much during the last three or four years.
When I first knew it, 
there was only some half-dozen plants, all told.
On Todhills 
Moss you will find the other two species — the Great- and the 
Long-Leaved.
You have heard of the peculiar properties of the 
Sundew time after time, and I am not going to repeat them now.
But some recent experiments conducted by Francis Darwin, son 
of Charles Darwin, may be new to you.
They were made with 
the view of finding out if the nitrogenous food benefitted the plant 
in any way.
He filled six plates with growing and healthy plants 
of the Drosera.
The plates were placed in a favourable situation, 
and screened so that no insect could get at them ; a line was 
drawn down the centre of the plates, and on one side of the line 
they were fed with minute fibres of beef; the plants on the other 
side got nothing.
In every other respect — light, air, etc., the 
conditions were similar.
I will now give you, somewhat roughly, 
the results of the experiment when the time of growing was over.
The fed plants beat the unfed ones in the number of flower stems 
29 per cent., in leaves 36 per cent., in number and weight of seeds 
22 per cent, and 57 per cent., in number and weight of seed 
capsules 94 per cent, and 30 per cent.
A similar experiment was 
carried out by three German professors, only instead of using beef, 
the Green Fly was used, and similar results were obtained.
I have 
seen it stated somewhere — but unfortunately I cannot come across 
the article again — that the Round-Leaved Sundew was the only one 
which was insectivorous ; but this is certainly not the case.
For 
86 
while on Todhills Moss on the 26th of August last (1883), every 
plant of the Great Sundew we found retained insects in different 
stages of digestion and captivity.
In many cases the leaves — 
unlike those of the Common Sundew, which gradually encloses 
from all sides — were folded boldly over in two halves.
The Common Milkwort, Polygala vulgaris, grows plentifully on 
Kingmoor, where the variety P.
v. depressa may also be found ; 
but finer plants than the Kingmoor ones may be found on Stainton 
Banks.
The colour of the flowers varies from white through pink 
and lilac to blue.
An old time name of this pretty little plant was 
Rogation or Procession Flower.
Among the garlands of wild 
flowers made by the " goodlie companies" who went out into the 
fields during Rogation week to give praise to God, our modest 
little flower was conspicuous.
In the order of the Pinks or Carnations, CARVOPHYLLACEiE, we 
have nothing very extraordinary except perhaps the Wood Stichwort, 
Stellaria nemorum, common in Wetheral Woods, Mire Banks, &c.
This is a very rare plant in Lancashire and Cheshire, according to 
the Secretary of one of the Liverpool clubs, who gives in a paper 
his many disappointments in search of it.
Soapwort, Saponaria 
officinalis, is said to have grown on the Scar some years ago, and I 
am still in hopes of finding it ; for the Scar, as a bit of botanical 
hunting-ground in a small space, is very rich.
Among other 
common plants in the above order are the Red and the White 
Campions, the Ragged Robin, etc.
The Corncockle may be 
found every year in some of the cornfields between Kingmoor and 
Cargo.
Flax is either grown with us for economic purposes, or else occurs 
as a casual about roadsides, railway banks, etc.
In a small field of 
Flax near Cringledykes, this summer — and a field of Flax in flower 
is a sight worth seeing — occurred that rare casual, as Mr. Hodgson 
calls it, the Wild Radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, belonging to 
the CRUCiFERiE.
The Mountain Flax, L.
catharticum, (why 
Mountain ?
seeing it grows as commonly in our lowlands as any 
other situation, and may be found in most of our meadows, railway 
banks, etc.;) is noted for its medicinal properties, and is in great 
87 
request in many of our country districts yet.
Indeed, I know of 
one country blacksmith living at a ripe healthy old age now, who 
averred to me that the only medicine he ever took when ailing, 
was tea made from this plant, and "a pint or two of yell efter." 
Of the Mallows, the Common Mallow, Malva sylvestris, is the 
one most generally seen, and is often called the Marsh Mallow, 
and is used with the same efTect.
In fact the Marsh Mallow, 
Althea officinalis, is not so common as is supposed.
The very 
handsome Musk Mallow, M.
moschata, may be found on the 
gravel beds at Cummersdale, and down by the side of the Eden.
A white variety grows in Wreay churchyard.
Of the St. John's Worts, Hypericum, the Common St. John's 
Wort is found in profusion on many of our railway banks, the 
Scar, etc.
This is the one with the seemingly perforated leaves, 
the perforations really being oil glands, and which possibly have 
something to do with its healing qualities.
It is much sought 
after by herbalists, who make an excellent ointment from it.
Gerard e 
says, "St. John's Wort doth make an oyle the colour of blood, 
which is a most pretious remedy for deep wounds and those that 
thorow the body, or any wound made with a venomed weapon." 
If. quadranguliini, Square-Stalked St. John's Wort, grows on the 
Scar, as also does the Bearded Hypericum, H.
montanum.
The 
very pretty trailing St. John's Wort, H.
humifusutn, may be found 
in the hedge bank from between the top of the Scar and Kingmoor 
Wood.
Of the Geranium order we have the Dusky Cranes-bill, G.phcsm7i, 
near the House of Recovery, and at Rockcliffe, possibly a garden 
escape ; but as I have never seen it under cultivation, the matter 
is open to some doubt.
The Shining Cranes-bill, G.
lucidum, in 
a hedge behind the Print Works at Cummersdale ; the Long- 
Stalked Cranes-bill, G.
columbinum, at Cummersdale; the Wood 
Cranes-bill, at Wetheral ; while nowhere so fine as on Stainton 
Banks grows the beautiful blue Meadow Cranes-bill, G.
pratense ; 
a white variety of the Herb Robert, G.
roberfianum, may be met 
with about Woodbank and Brisco.
The Storks-bill,* E.
ciaitarium, 
* Since found on Grinsdale Gravel Bed.
88 
I have not found nearer Carlisle than Dalston.
The Wood Sorrel, 
Oxalis acetosella, is common in most of our woods, and a few of 
its leaves with their slightly-acidulated taste, are highly refreshing 
on a hot day.
Of the LEGUMiNoSiE, the Broom is common.
Both species of 
the Whins or Furze may be found on Kingmoor ; one coming into 
blossom as the other fades.
So if the winter is moderately open, 
we have the Furze in bloom all the year round.
I suppose it is 
this fact that has given rise to the old couplet — 
When the Whin is out of blossom.
Then love is out of fashion.
Dyer's Green-weed may be met with in some of the lanes about 
Cargo ; the Petty- or Needle-Whin on Kingmoor ; Rest Harrow, 
on Stainton Banks.
The Spiny species, near Rockcliffe; the 
Common Kidney Vetch or Lamb's Toes, and the Lady's Fingers, 
on many of the railway banks ; the Purple Medick or Lucerne, on 
the Scar — an escape, I should think, from cultivation.
The pods 
of this plant are curiously twisted like a ram's horn.
On the Scar 
we have also the Melilot, in some seasons so abundant that in early 
autumn, with a gentle western wind, you may perceive its honied 
smell wafted up to you as you walk along the Scar from Edentown 
to St. Ann's.
Several other species of this order, which includes 
the Trefoils or Clovers, the Vetches, etc., may be found growing 
close to our City.
Among the Rosacea, the sweet-scented flowers of the Meadow 
Sweet, or Queen of the Meadows, are met with everywhere along 
our water sides and in our meadows.
The Wood Avens is common 
on hedge-banks, and the dusky modest flowers of the Water Avens 
in Spa Well Wood.
Two or three of the Potentillas are common, 
the Tormentil perhaps being the most so.
This plant is noted for 
the astringent properties of its roots ; it was sold largely in London 
during the great plague, as one of the cures.
The Marsh Comarum 
grows very luxuriantly on Todhills Moss.
Of the Blackberry, 
Bramble, or "Brummelkite," we have several species, which have 
not been fully studied.
I may say the same of the Wild Roses.
One species, the Sweetbriar, is found on the outskirts of Kingmoor.
89 
Agrimony is met with in the Stainton Lanes.
Both the Bumets, 
the Greater Burnet and the Lesser, on Stainton Banks.
The 
Ladies' Mantle, a favorite ingredient in " yarb puddings," in all 
our meadows.
It obtained its name of Ladies' Mantle from a use 
which I think at present it is not put to.
The Parsley Piert is 
common in the cornfields round Kingmoor.
This is a plant I had 
looked for for many years, without being able to find it ; at last it 
turned up as a weed in my own garden.
Thinking there must be 
more of it near at hand, I had another search, and found it under 
the circumstances I have mentioned.
Apropos of this plant, my 
brother and I came across a celebrated "yarb" doctor gathering 
one of the smaller geraniums.
On our asking him what he was 
gathering, he replied "parsley peert," or "breakstone;" and it was 
in vain that we tried to persuade him that it was not Parsley Piert, 
but Dove's-foot Cranesbill he was getting.
He knew better, he 
had prescribed it many a time with great success.
Well, we had 
to give in then, and to thank a merciful Providence that we had so 
few poisonous plants in our British List, or some serious mistakes 
would be made sometimes.
The Great Hairy Willowherb grows 
very fine on the Scar ; the Small-Flowered species is common by 
our roadsides.
I once met with the Evening Primrose near King- 
moor, and I have also seen it growing on the Scar below St. Ann's; 
but in both cases I must put it down as a garden escape.
The 
Enchanter's Nightshade, on Davidson's Banks.
The very hand- 
some flowers of the Purple Loosestrife, by the side of Kingmoor, 
the Black Dub, Holme Head, etc.
This is one of the heterostyled 
plants which Darwin (see his "Forms of Flowers,") experimented 
upon to prove the value of cross-fertilisation.
Among his concluding 
remarks are the following: "We may be sure that plants have 
been rendered heterostyled to ensure cross fertilisation, for we 
now know that a cross between the distinct individuals of the 
same species is highly important for the vigour and fertility of the 
offspring." Of the many flowers of the Purple Loosestrife I have 
examined, I find the different styles are pretty near equal.
Of the two Knawells, the annual one is found near Cummers- 
dale.
90 
Of species belonging to the order Crassulace/E, our list is not 
very long.
The largest genus, represented by the Sedmns, consists 
of plants that belong mostly to alpine districts.
The Houseleek 
is common on many cottage roofs in the district.
Near Green 
Lane, the rare and curious plant called in old herbals.
Navel or 
Kidney Wort, is found ; better known now, perhaps, by the name 
of Wall Penny-Wort.
The next order, Saxifragace^, being chiefly alpine plants, I 
must pass over, except in the genus Chrysosplenium, and we have 
the Opposite-Leaved Golden Saxifrage, and the Alternate-Leaved 
almost equally common by the sides of our streams and rivers ; the 
nearest place I can think of being the Scar below St. Ann's.
The pretty little Moschatel, " without glory," as the scientific 
name gives it, is called by children the Town Clock, may be found 
in the Stainton Lanes, and is a curious little plant, the flower stem 
having at its apex four flowers set in a square with one at the top.
Of the order XjMBELLiFERiE, the White Rot or Marsh Penny- 
Wort grows on Kingmoor ; and if you want to find the flower, you 
must look very carefully indeed.
This plant shares with some 
other marsh plants the name of Sheep Rot, from the supposed 
action it has on the bones of animals which feed upon it.
Hemlock, 
which is easily known by its purple-spotted stem, grows about 
Stainton, Cummersdale, etc.
Before the alterations were made in 
the shrubbery in Court Square, several fine plants might have been 
seen there ; and I have no doubt it will turn up again some day.
The Procumbent Marsh Wort in Pow Beck, near the Spa Well; 
Goat, Gout, or Bishop Weed, Herb Gerarde, everywhere, well 
known to all our gardeners as a most noxious weed.
This plant 
was brought to England by the famous old herbalist whose name 
it bears, presumably, I suppose, for its medicinal virtues.
But like 
sparrows in America, or rabbits in Australia, it has outlived those 
properties for which it was first introduced, and it remains now but 
as a troublesome pest.
The English- or Whorled-Carraway, found 
growing on Kingmoor, is a plant which I believe I have the honor 
of first making known as indigenous to Cumberland.
I communi- 
cated with Mr. Hodgson on the subject, as he has the most 
91 
complete list of the Cumberland flora.
But it was not marked on 
his list, which combines with his own the finds of his late colleagues, 
Mr. W.
Dickinson of Workington, and the Rev. R.
Wood of West- 
ward.
Indeed I suppose the plant is not common anywhere, as in 
the London Catalogue it is given in only nineteen out of the one 
hundred and twelve counties in which Great Britain is botanically 
divided.
The Burnet Saxifrage occurs about Rickerby and other 
places, and is not uncommon ; Water Drop-Wort, at Spa Well ; 
Fool's Parsley, a supposed poisonous species, and easily known by 
its three long pendulous flower bracts, is often to be found in 
ill-weeded gardens and waste grounds.
Fine specimens of Angelica 
can be had in Kingmoor Wood, and the plant is common in all 
our damp woods and copses.
The name was given to this herb from 
its having so many virtues ; and it was, in consequence, in great 
request in bygone times : every part of it being used in medicine.
The Wild Carrot grows in great luxuriance on the Scar; its pretty 
white umbels, often with a single central red floret, make it very con- 
spicuous.
As the flowers die, the outer rays of the umbel grow 
upward and inward, shaping the head of seeds like a miniature 
bird's nest — by wliich name it is often called.
The yellow, tough, 
and woody root has the same smell as that of the garden carrot ; 
but so far as edible qualities are concerned, there the resemblance 
ends.
Still the two carrots teach us a useful lesson in regard to 
what may be done with a suitable subject by cultivation.
The order Loranthace^ includes the Mistletoe, a plant much 
in request at the present (Christmas) season.
It is not common 
about Carlisle ; but I have seen a few growing at different times.
One grew on a Cumberland hawthorn, if I remember rightly, in 
the Gas Works garden ; but the tree had to make way for the 
alterations in Nelson Bridge.
The Elder, and the Guelder Rose, 
are both pretty common ; the latter is our Garden Snowball.
In 
many cases, I fancy, the Elder must have been planted, possibly 
for the berries, which make a delicious winter cordial ; or else for 
the wood, which is largely used by butchers to make skewers of 
The Honeysuckle, or Woodbine, is common all round Carlisle.
It is one of the earliest shrubs to show its leaf; but it has a curious 
92 
habit very early on in the year of unfolding a portion of its leaves, 
and then as it were finding itself before its time, it stops, and 
remains so for weeks with no perceptible change.
All at once it 
wakens from its lethargy, and stops growing no more till it is in 
full leaf.
It is a long passage to the honey in the corolla of this 
plant, and short-tongued bees have a readier method of getting at 
the honey there by biting a piece out at the bottom of the corolla 
tube.
This you can often see for yourselves by carefully examining 
a few flowers of the Honeysuckle.
In the order Rubiace^ four of the Bedstraws may be found on 
the Scar : the Yellow, the Crosswort, the Great Hedge-Bedstraw, 
and the Goosegrass or Cleavers ; the Smooth Heath-Bedstraw on 
Kingmoor : this latter plant, in miles and miles of tramping on the 
Crossfell range this last summer (1883), met my eye everywhere.
Field Madder occurs about Cummersdale and Dalston.
The 
Woodruff is found in most of our damp woods ; it is noted for the 
delicate odour it givs forth when dried, resembling new-mown hay; 
but no plant keeps the odour so long, and a bunch of Woodruff 
hung in a room will scent it all the winter through.
In the order Valerianace.*, we have the small Marsh Valerian 
near Cummersdale ; the great Wild Valerian is common by the 
ditch sides round Kingmoor; the Lamb's Lettuce, by the hedge 
side at St. Ann's : this last-named plant was formerly in great 
request as a spring salad, and I see by the Seedsmen's Catalogues, 
it is coming to the front again, and is being largely cultivated.
The Smooth Corn-Salad, at Cummersdale, near the Railway Station; 
and this year, the rare Sharp-Fruited Corn-Salad, near Upperby.
For this find, and many more good things, I am indebted to one 
of our members— Mr. Shepherd.
The Teasel, I think, grows 
in this district only as a garden-plant, or as an escape.
Devil's-Bit 
Scabious, on Kingmoor and at Cummersdale.
The Small Scabious 
grows on Stainton Banks, side by side with the Great Scabious, or 
Field Knautia — two very conspicuous flowers.
The mention of 
these last two flowers reminds me of a little incident which occurred 
this last summer, and which shows that a little knowledge of wild 
flowers might be useful to the best among us.
They were gathered 
93 
among others, and given to a small boy to take to a Sunday-school 
treat, where, among other things, was a prize for the best bouquet 
of wild flowers.
I have no doubt the little fellow was immensely 
proud of them, for you will find few such places for a bouquet of 
wild flowers as Stainton Banks.
But imagine his feelings when the 
vicar, who, I believe, was presiding judge on the occasion, debarred 
them as being garden flowers.
Amongst the CompositvE we have the Yellow Goats-beard, which 
may be seen in perfection on the Scar, and is a very handsome 
flower when seen fully open '"neath the morning sun;" Jack 
go-to-bed-at-noon is an old name for this plant, from its habit of 
closing its petals at mid-day.
Jack must certainly be lazier now 
than he used to be, because I never remember seeing him awake 
after ii a.m., and he often closes before that time.
To this order 
also belong the numerous families of Hawkbits, Cats Ears, Lettuces, 
Sowthistles (one species too often seen in our cornfields), Hawk- 
beards, and Hawkweeds, the latter a most puzzling family to make 
out.
Then come the Dandelions and the Nipplewort, the latter 
common about our hedges, and remarkable in the spring for a very 
beautiful microscopic fungus, in the form of a cluster cup.
Burdock 
is common with us, some splendid specimens may be seen about 
Stainton.
The seed capsules of this plant are covered with hooked 
scales, and cling readily to anything they get hold of, by such 
means getting widely distributed.
Country lads know this of the 
"burs," as they are called, and often make use of them to embellish 
their friends' clothing.
Shakspeare also knew it ; in Troilus and 
Cressida he makes Pandarus say of his kindred, " Though they be 
long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won : they are 
burs I can tell you ; they'll stick where they are thrown." 
Nowhere as on Kingmoor and in the wood will you find such 
fine specimens of the Saw-wort.
It is an autumn flowering plant, 
and it looks like a small purple thistle.
Of the Thistles themselves, 
many of them are common — too common — everywhere ; and I 
think we have nothing close at hand worth particular notice.
The 
Black Knapweed is common, and is often known by the name of 
"Horseknops;" it is greatly used in the feeding of certaifi cage 
94 
birds.
The Greater Knapweed, a handsome bright purple-rayed 
flower, may be found on the Caledonian Railway banks, near 
where the North British Railway crosses.
The beautiful Corn 
Blue-Bottle, often grown as a garden plant, I have found a few 
times in the neigbourhood, in turnip fields about Kingmoor, and 
on Grinsdale gravel bed.
The Nodding Bur Marigold, in a pond 
at Scotby, near the Midland Station ; the Trifid Bur Marigold in 
a similar situation at Moorhouse.
The Hemp Agrimony on the 
Scar, and in the Spa Well Wood ; the plants on the Scar are the 
largest I ever saw.
Tansy may be found in great plenty along 
Stainton Banks, in the hedge at St. Ann's, etc.; it was known to 
me as a boy by the name of Batchelors' Buttons.
By the bye, did 
any of you ever try a Tansy pudding ?
a suet pudding mixed with 
finely chopped Tansy leaves.
I had heard it very highly spoken 
of, and knew of a farm house in our sister county where it was 
always made when they had company to dinner.
Well, always 
being willing to try fresh recipes, I had one made once ; but, never 
again !
The Common Wormwood and the Mugwort may both be 
found near the Caledonian Railway Sheds, and the latter plant also 
on Stainton Banks, and I suppose it gets its name from being 
formerly used to flavour drinks.
The Cudweed is common on 
damp ground, especially where water has been standing.
The 
Butterbur and the Coltsfoot, both noted for the flower coming 
before the leaf; the former by our river sides, the latter on railway 
banks and waste ground.
There seems to me to be a special 
arrangement in these two plants, that the flowers should come before 
the leaves, to better propagate their species.
Because if coming 
after, there would be very little chance of their being seen, or of 
getting their share of the sun's rays ; hence they would be passed 
over by the insects which cross-fertilise them, and in not getting 
their share of sunshine, they would not ripen their seeds as fully 
as they ought to do.
The Golden Rod, a flower which might 
almost be mistaken for Ragwort, grows on Skewbanks and near 
Rickerby.
Of the Groundsels or Ragworts, we have the Stinking 
Groundsel at Cummersdale, the Marsh Ragwort on Kingmoor, 
and the.
giant of the family, Scnecio saracenicus, on Stainton Banks, 
95 
often growing to a height of seven or eight feet.
This last is not 
considered a truly indigenous plant, and it is only within these last 
two or three years that I have noticed it in its present situation.
The Yellow Fleabane, another rare plant not mentioned in the 
lists published in our Transactions, occurs on the Scar.
The 
Corn Marigold, about Cargo and Grinsdale.
Chamomile used to 
grow between Harraby and Durran Hill.
The Sneezewort on 
Kingmoor.
Of the Campanulace^, the Round-leaved Bell Flower, locally 
called Blue Bells, is "'common everywhere.
I always look out for 
the flowering of this plant, as it is a sure sign of midsummer ; and 
one patch which I pass every day, comes regularly into flower as 
the last week of June comes around.
I once picked a white 
variety of the Rampion Bell Flower by the roadside near Harker; 
but I fancy it must have been an escape.
Down Botcherby 
Lonning, fine examples of the Giant Bell Flower are to be found ; 
it also grows on the Scar, but the plants found there are very poor.
The Clustered Bell Flower on Stainton Banks grows magnificently, 
and attracts the attention at once by its clusters of dark purple-blue 
corollas.
Sheepsbit looks more like one of the Compositae than 
a Bell Flower, its small flowers being clustered together on a 
hemispherical head.
It is found on Kingmoor.
We have two of the Heaths on Kingmoor, the Cross-leaved 
Heath and the Fine-leaved ; a white variety of the Cross-leaved 
Heath occasionally occurs.
The Fine-leaved Heath is to be found 
on that part of the moor near the Glasgow road.
Ling or Heather, 
on waste ground round us, the rose-coloured flowers often relapsing 
to white.
That very pretty flower, the Marsh Andromeda, is to be 
found at Todhills, and grows on most of our peat-bogs.
This is 
quite a northern flower, and one which we ought to be proud of 
The Bilberry is found in Kingmoor Wood ; the Cranberry at 
Todhills ; while that somewhat rare plant, the Lesser Winter-green, 
may be found in plantations at Kingmoor, Durdar, and Little 
Often.
97 
SHRIKES.
By the Rev. II.
A. MACPHERSON, M.A.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
Five species of the Genus Lanius visit England, viz : — 
The Red-backed Shrike ; 
The Woodchat Shrike; 
The Lesser Grey Shrike ; 
The Great Grey Shrike ; 
The Pallas's Grey Shrike.
The Red-backed Shrike is a regular summer visitor, usually 
arriving in the Southern Counties during the first week in May.
The male is a beautiful slate-grey above, with chestnut-brown back, 
dark wings, a black and white tail, the under-surface of the body 
being pale red.
He has also a very distinct black eye-stripe.
The 
Red-backed Shrike breeds in all the counties of England and 
Wales, but becomes rarer towards the north, so that though well 
established in the Lake District, it seldom breeds as far north as 
Carlisle, and has only occurred in Scotland in a very few instances.
Personally, I have nowhere found it so abundant as in the rural 
districts around London ; in Epping Forest, for instance, I have 
often observed the male of this species perched, like a sentinel, on 
the topmost spray of a tall hedgerow, waiting to dart down upon 
the passing insect.
It has only, however, fallen to my lot once 
to see an insect caught and impaled ; my impression is that the 
Shrike does not impale by any means all his prey.
The objects 
8 
98 
of the impaling practised so extensively by our Shrikes are twofold.
The most obvious one is, that, by impaling the mouse or bird which 
the Shrike has caught, it may be able to tear the prey to pieces at 
leisure.
The feet of the Shrikes are not powerful enough to 
accomplish this, and their food is therefore adroitly spitted upon a 
sharp thorn.
But the Shrike has another object in mind.
His 
dashing spirit cannot brook the idea of allowing any prey to pass 
unmolested ; and therefore he dashes upon his quarry whether 
hungry or not ; and if his internal feelings prompt him to make a 
meal of it forthwith, he proceeds to dispose of it then and there.
My friend, Mr. O.
V. Aplin, a well-known ornithologist, remarks 
in a letter of July 20, 1883: — "We obtained before breakfast this 
morning two Bumble-bees, from some thorns.
I watched the male 
Shrike the other evening at work on the thorns, but unfortunately 
he ate the morsel at once." But if, on the other hand, the Shrike 
is "crowded," he leaves his booty on the thorn until he has "room" 
for more.
I have said that I have only once seen a wild Shrike 
impale his prey.
It happened in this wise.
We were watching a 
pair of these birds on a Hertfordshire heath one lovely summer 
evening, when a Bumble-bee passed by ; instantly the male Shrike 
swooped upon his quarry, and, catching it in his bill, flew with it 
to a low thorn-bush, on which he spitted it.
I then ran in, and 
found the bee transfixed as neatly as if an entomologist had pinned 
it to his setting board.
The Red-backed Shrike builds a bulky nest, usually in a tall 
hedgerow.
The young readily betray the "location" of their 
cradle by their clamour for fresh supplies of food.
The nest is 
often harried, and I have more than once seen the young of this 
Shrike offered for sale in Leadenhall Market.
My special reason for offering you these cursory remarks on this 
and other species of Shrikes, this evening, is to place before you 
some observations which I have made upon them under artificial 
conditions.
I have more thaft once reared young Red-backed 
Slirikes from the nest, and found them interesting pets.
They 
readily become attached to the person who feeds them, and will 
follow you from room to room, or even about a garden, perching 
9» 
upon your shoulder or your hand.
With regard to the present 
species, it is only right to say that the gentleman who has paid 
most attention to it in confinement is my friend Mr. John Young, 
M.B.O.U., who has kept examples for several successive autumns.
His object in doing so, was, to ascertain at what time this species 
naturally performed the moult.
He has, unfortunately, failed 
hitherto to preserve his examples alive through the manlt; but the 
fact that he has repeatedly lost Red-backed Shrikes by death in 
January and February, when in full moult, is full of significance.
Two male examples also moulted in the possession of the Zoological 
Society during the spring, I believe, of 1879 : but exact data hereon 
is not forthcoming.
Nevertheless, its want is in part supplied by 
the evidence of Mr. Swaysland, the well-known dealer of Brighton, 
who informs me under date of October 8, 1883, that he believes 
that the Red-backed Shrike " moults about January or February.
The one I had (Mr. Swaysland here alludes to one particular bird, 
for many examples have passed through his hands,) moulted in 
January, and I showed him at the Crystal Palace Show this year 
in full plumage the last week in February." 
I now propose to lay before you the gist of my notes on five 
Red-backed Shrikes which I kept alive during the summer and 
autumn of 1883.
I received four of them, being a single brood, 
during the first week in July.
They had been taken from a nest 
in the neighbourhood of Bristol, and appeared to be between four 
and five weeks old.
Their appetites were enormous, and were 
only surpassed in intensity by their squalls for food.
Not that 
they would help themselves.
True, they had begun to pick up, 
but they preferred to have the supply conveyed into their mouths.
The females especially were incessant in their demands for food.
As a consequence of their voracity, these young Shrikes slept a 
good deal during the day.
I should except one of the males, 
which I christened "No. i," for distinction's sake; the other male, 
a very quarrelsome bird, following as "No. 2 ;" while the females 
were "No. 3," and "No. 4." No. 4, however, strayed through an 
open window, before I had had them long, and I saw no more of 
her.
No. i, as I have said, did not gorge himself; as a natural 
100 
consequence, he throve best of all, and escaped the sleek obesity 
of the rest of the party.
During the time that I kept these Shrikes, they fed chiefly on 
egg, bread and milk, and raw meat.
But from the first they 
showed a keen relish for insects.
Thus I noted on August i6th, 
" The three young Shrikes all exhibit great excitement when a 
House-fly passes, and take House-flies and Bluebottles readily from 
my fingers.
They appreciate dried ' ants' eggs' (really ants' cocoons), 
but like far better a Mealworm or a Daddy-long-legs ; and snap 
eagerly at an intruding Wasp." 
But they seemed to take a delight in holding their live food as 
gingerly as possible.
Thus, on October 25th I offered No. 2 a 
fine Bluebottle, just as I sat down myself to breakfast.
He was 
not hungry, having just swallowed two plump Mealworms ; so he 
sidled up, took the Bluebottle delicately, and then held it dangling 
in the air by a single wing.
Naturally the wing tore, and gave way, 
and the fly returned to the window pane, to No. 2's disgust.
But 
his brother bird, my favourite No. i, had watched the proceedings 
from an upper perch with the air of a connoiseur.
I re-captured 
the fly, and offered it to No. i ; he took it most carefully by the 
thorax, and holding it tightly, first crushed and then bolted it.
A little later, I offered No. 2 another fly, and he proved that he 
had learnt discretion; for though he seized it by the legs, he 
raised his right foot, and grasped it for a moment between his 
talons, then seized it by the abdomen with his beak, and forthwith 
swallowed it.
On October 28th, I noted that No. i ate bread and milk in 
rather a peculiar way, viz., by holding it between his toes, using 
his foot therefore as a hand, whilst he pulled the bread to pieces 
with his beak, resting during his meal on his left leg and on the 
support of the upper part of the tarsus of the right leg ; that is to 
say, that his right foot being engaged and unable therefore to grasp 
the perch, he leant upon the edge of the tarsus.
These young Red-backed Shrikes never refused food ; but if 
gorged already, would hang the fresh supply upon a cross wire, or 
lay it down on the edge of a perch.
Perhaps the point about 
101 
these Shrikes that surprised me most was the early age at which 
they began to sing.
The females never attempted to sing, but the 
males sang while clamouring to be fed by hand.
Both males sang 
pretty constantly, but their vocal powers diverged from one another.
No. I sang in a low sweet tone, while No. 2 sang decidedly louder, 
but with less sweetness.
Latterly, they acquired much of the song 
ot a young Rock Thrush, which I kept in the same room.
My friend, Mr. H.
D. Astley, F.Z.S., also kept a Red-backed 
Shrike last autumn, of which he remarks in a letter of September 
17th, that "he sings in an undertone." 
On October 25th, my diary runs, "Mr. W.
Duckworth has just 
called.
No. i was singing, so we paused in the hall, that Mr.
Duckworth might hear the song, unseen.
Mr. Duckworth 
remarked that he had no idea that the species could produce such 
sweet notes." When we entered the room.
No. i continued 
singing, but No. 2 stopped his song to raise a cackle of indignation 
at the stranger's approach.
Besides the song proper, I noticed : — 
1. A squeaking cry for food.
2. A lower note of complacence, on receiving a nice morsel.
3. A loud chuckle of anger or surprise, which I called the 
"war cry," always accompanied by a very rapid swaying of the 
tail — a motion from side to side and at the same time perpen- 
dicular.
One evening a friend brought a small terrier into my 
rooms ; No. i dozed peacefully, but Nos. 2 and 3 raised the war 
cry, and sustained it at the top of their voices for more than 
twenty successive minutes.
And here it may be remarked that the female, when about to be 
fed, not only squalled for the morsel, but expanded her wings 
laterally to their full extent.
On one occasion I had an excellent opportunity of noting the 
courtship of the Red-backed Shrike.
During the forenoon of 
October 25th, the sunlight happened to stream into my rooms, 
and fell on the Shrikes' cage.
The Rock Thrush began to sing, 
and so did Shrike No. 2.
Twice did the Shrike sing most of the 
102 
Rock Thrush's strain ; as he sang on, his amatory instincts 
grew, and he began to bow as he sang, raising himself to 
his full height, and then bowing grotesquely, first on one 
side and then on the other.
As he sang on, he moved back- 
wards and forwards, bowing all the time, until at last he fairly 
bowed his astonished brother bird off the perch.
Presently there 
came a pause, and then the singing and bowing set in again ; once 
more he bowed his fellow off the perch, and so pleased was he, 
that he fired off the rest of his spirits in a continuation of clattering 
war cries, swaying his tail excitedly ; the performance ended, he 
flew wildly backwards and forwards from one end of the aviary cage 
to the other, as though seized with a paroxysm of migratory fever.
I must not dwell much longer upon the Red-backed Shrike ; 
but before I bring my remarks on this species to a close, let me 
give you an instance of the self-possession of one of my subjects.
On December 6th, I offered the two male Shrikes each a Meal- 
worm.
Now they were each devouring a lump of meat, holding 
it between their feet, as they could not spit it, and tearing it into 
shreds with their bill.
What were they to do, when a luscious 
Mealworm dangled before their eyes?
In their despair they 
war-hooped for a minute or so ; then No. 2 dropped his lump of 
meat with a thud of regret, and seized the fat grub.
Not so No. i.
Scorning his brother's weakness, he sidled up to me on one leg, 
holding his lump of meat in the other, and took the Mealworm 
with his beak.
It happened, however, to be a very lively grub, 
and resented being devoured by a Shrike on one leg, by such 
vigorous wriglings, that No. i was at last fain to drop his meat.
He then bolted the Mealworm in a great hurry, and swooped 
down upon the morsel of meat as if it was of priceless value.
And here I should observe that Shrikes, like Hawks and many 
other birds, disgorge the indigestible portions of their food in 
pellets.
Whenever, therefore, these young Shrikes threw up a 
pellet, even at night, they generally flew down to find another bit 
of meat or other food, to supply the newly-created vacuum.
Before taking leave of these Red-backed Shrikes, it remains for 
me to point out that a sort of intermediate moult commenced 
103 
about August 15th, and was continued in September, when, being 
in plump condition, they moulted the feathers of the breast and 
head, as well as some of the back.
Mr. Astley noted a similar 
occurrence in his young bird.
But neither my hand-reared female, 
nor one which my correspondent Mr. Frank procured for me from 
Germany, had moulted any feathers, when they died, in November.
My two males, Nos. i and 2, died, to my great regret, early in 
December, 1883, victims of consumption, which I tried in vain to 
stay.
One point which I ascertained from these examples is, that they 
change the colour of their legs gradually.
In July the tarsus and 
toes of my young birds was of a delicate French grey ; when they 
died in December, the light grey had become iron grey ; and had 
they lived through the winter, I have no doubt they would have 
become as black as they usually are in adult examples.
Did time permit, I might say much more of this species, but 
we must now pass on to consider the VVoodchat and the Grey 
Shrikes.
The Woodchat is an extremely rare summer visitor to England.
I have only once seen it in England, i.e., near Hertford, in May, 
1873, when I saw a beautiful example perched on the projecting 
bough of a noble oak.
I have never yet met with anyone else who 
has seen the bird in England himself; and it is therefore with great 
pleasure that I shall cite a record of its occurrence in Cumberland.
The late Mr. W.
Dickinson, F.L.S., states at p.
21 of {lis Remi- 
niscences of West Cumberland, that, "On April nth, 1872, I saw 
a Woodchat Shrike near Stainburn Tannery.
It sat on the wall 
several minutes, while I stood within twenty yards of it." 
It was in August, 1881, that I obtained from a Geneva tailor a 
male and a female Woodchat, which he had reared by hand.
Their 
nestling dress was paler than that of the nestling Red-backed 
Shrikes ; but an example which my friend Mr. Young obtained the 
same autumn from Paris, was a very dark individual.
The male of my Woodchats was easily distinguished from his 
sister by his superior size, and carriage; by his nearly white throat; 
104 
and by his underparts being less marked with grey than the 
female.
When offered food, the female was very bold, opening her 
wings, fluttering them, and squeaking for food like a spoilt kitten.
The male Woodchat was quieter and less bold.
He generally 
selected the largest morsels of meat, and devoured them leisurely, 
holding them between the toes of his left foot.
The greedier 
female chose smaller morsels of food, in order to bolt them as 
rapidly as possible.
They drank very little.
Indeed, I never saw 
the male drink between August loth, when I obtained them, and 
August 17th.
As it happened, we left Geneva on August nth for 
St. Beatenberg, on the mountain side, above Interlaken.
The 
Woodchats appeared to feel acutely the fall in temperature.
On 
August 1 8th, a Bluebottle approaching the birds, the female 
Woodchat made many futile efforts to seize it.
The male was 
cannier.
He watched the fly enter the cage, allowed it to settle 
on the meat, and when he saw that it was off its guard, down he 
dropped on it and secured it as it rose.
But his sister bird dashed 
at him, snatched it out of his beak, and carried it off to the top 
perch, where she transferred it to a foot and devoured it com- 
placently.
On August 1 6th, she caught an Earwig, which promptly 
vanished down her throat.
On August 25th, I picked up a huge 
green Grasshopper, and as he had lost several legs, I took him to the 
Woodchats.
They had a sharp tussle for it, in which the female 
carried off the remaining leg, and crushing it in her beak, devoured 
it in spite of its barbs.
The male killed the insect by pinching the 
abdomen, after which he swallowed it piecemeal, the abdomen 
first, then the head, and last of all the thorax.
On August 21st, 
the female in my presence carried five or six small pieces of meat 
from the food trough to the first perch, and then hung them in a 
row over the wire frame-work of the cage.
I had repeatedly seen 
them thus suspended, but had not seen them being hung before.
I therefore dislodged them, but the female Woodchat dashed down 
after them, and replaced them as she had arranged them pre- 
viously.
I may remark that these Woodchats, like my Red-backed 
105 
Shrikes, were fond of bathing ; but whereas the males of the 
Red-backed Shrike used to abuse the female (No. 2 nearly killed 
both No. I and No. 3 in a paroxysm of temper), the two Wood- 
chats, in a far smaller cage, lived in unity and concord.
Moreover, 
they had a distinct idea of the difference between meum and tuiim.
Of course, they both tugged at the same Grasshopper or the same 
Frog (for I gave them small Edible Frogs and Tadpoles), but they 
never lost their tempers ; and if either had hung up a dainty on 
the wires of the cage, the other, however hungry, would not think 
of touching his fellow's spoil.
Before I pass on to the Grey Shrikes, I may say that, though I 
lost the female Woodchat in the following September, when she 
had not lost a feather, — yet I nursed the male bird through a long 
moult, which commenced in mid August, and was all but finished 
when he died of a surfeit of Blackbeetles, through the cook's over- 
indulgence, in the following December.
I had placed him for 
warmth in the kitchen, and he used to watch the Blackbeetles 
flopping into a beetle-trap ; whenever he saw a beetle tumble in, 
he gave a war-hoop, to let the servant know, and in order to 
humour him, they attended to his wants.
He never sang as a 
nestling, but some days before his death I had the pleasure of 
hearing him singing a low but sweet song.
Of our three British species of Grey Shrikes, the Lesser Grey 
alone is of extreme rarity with us.
It has only, so far as memory 
serves me, been captured three times : once on the coast of Nor- 
folk, and twice in Cornwall.
Up to the present time I have failed 
to obtain living examples.
The best known of the Grey Shrikes that visit England is the 
Great Grey Shrike.
It is scarcely to be distinguished from Pallas's 
Grey Shrike, which has also occurred occasionally in England, but 
more often on the east coast of Scotland.
These two species 
probably interbreed somewhere in Northern Europe, and a bird 
which I believe to be a hybrid* was shot near Carlisle in January 
* But Mr. Goodchild, F.Z.S., considers this bird to be a pure-bred Pallas's 
Shrike.

Grey Shrike from Archangel, now in the Bird Gallery at the Natural History 
Museum.

last, the pure example of the Great Grey Shrike, also exhibited, 
having been shot at Kirklinton last December.
On January 12th, 1884, I spent some hours in hunting for the 
above-mentioned bird, now the property of Mr. Ritson.t When 
about to give up the search from stress of time, I spied something 
very grey on the inside of a hedgerow in the Willow Hohne.
I 
walked quietly towards it, under cover at first ; when I was about 
fifty yards from it, or less, it darted across the field, flying very low, 
disappeared through a hedgerow, and I saw it no more.
Some 
four days later it was cleverly shot after a long stalk, for it was 
very wild, by Mr. Raiiton, from whom it passed into the collection 
of Mr. Ritson, for whom he was in the habit of shooting specimens.
Mr. Ritson most obligingly retained it in the flesh until I could 
examine it, and gave me the body, which proved on dissection, to 
be that of a female.
The stomach was quite empty.
The bird 
weighed two ounces and half a drachm.
On the 6th of February last, I saw another Grey Shrike, a 
beautiful blue-grey bird, in the wood which clothes the scar at 
Grinsdale.
Mr. Raiiton two days later found a Fieldfare impaled 
and partly eaten in the same wood ; he brought it to me, and I 
noted with surprise that the skull was quite intact ; for the tame 
example of which I am about to speak, invariably devoured the 
skull first of all.
However, Mr. Raiiton was never able to shoot 
this Shrike, though he once followed it for a considerable 
distance.
In conclusion, let me say a few words about a caged example, 
which was caught m Kincardineshire in November, entered my 
possession in December, and died in January from a swelling 
developed while I was taking country duty for an absent vicar.
From December 14th to 21st, this bird, a nearly mature male of 
the Great Grey Shrike, lived partly on liver, partly on an allowance 
of one sparrow per diem.
From December 21st to 27th, I gave 
him two birds a day.
On December 28th, I found him 
devouring a mouse, which he must have caught for himself in

the aviary ; when T disturbed him, he was holding it half- 
devoured in one foot.
On December 28th, I gave him a dead 
Blue Tit. He almost at once spitted it through the neck on an 
upright thorn ; he then pulled the head off, and swallowed it, 
feathers and all ; he returned to flay the breast, after which he 
took the bird off the thorn and respitted it, the thorn now passing 
through the lumbar region, and the tail being now uppermost ; he 
then tore the flesh off", swallowing many feathers, which he after- 
wards threw up as pellets ; finally he took the trunk of the Tit off 
the thorn and carried it to a corner of a perch, where he left it, but 
mounted guard over it : I then tossed him a dead Wren, which he 
ate in the same way.
I usually left him a supply of live sparrows, 
which he killed and hung whenever his larder was bare.
I had 
some misgivings at first as to whether he would not kill the sparrows 
one after another, and hang them in one long row.
But he was 
quite well disposed to them, and only killed them when he wanted 
a fresh meal.
He seemed to prefer house-mice to sparrows ; but 
whatever his food, he always hung it, whether given him alive or 
dead, before holding his post-mortem upon it.
Appended Notes.
(i.) From notes kindly given to me by Mr.
\V.
Greenup, 
extending over many years, it appears that, although in 1865 the 
Red-backed Shrike reached Keswick as early as April 27th, it is 
not until between May 9th and 12th that this species usually 
arrives in the Lake district.
(2.) When studying the Great Grey Shrike in the Rhine 
Marshes, July, 1884, I formed the conclusion, that the cries of the 
fledged nestlings, when clamouring to the old birds, are decidedly 
harsher but less shrill than those of the Red-backed Shi ike.
(3.) The falconers of Valconswaard informed me that the 
Great Grey Shrikes, used by them in netting " passage" falcons, 
are taken at the end of September or early in October with limed 
twigs ; and become so tame, that they cannot be used for taking 
falcons for more than a single season.

NOTES ON THE BEST LOCALITY 
FOR COAL BENEATH THE PERMIAN ROCKS OF 
NORTH-WEST CUMBERLAND.
By T.
V. HOLMES, F.G.S., M.A.I.
Coal is worked on many different geological horizons among the 
Carboniferous rocks of Cumberland and the Border, and not 
merely in those beds which are specially known as Coal Measures, 
and which constitute the Coal-field of Whitehaven, Workington, 
and Maryport.
The lowest coal-bearing strata of any importance 
are those of the Canobie Coal-field, just across the Border, which 
are now ascertained by the Geological Survey to be the equivalent 
in geological position of the lowest beds of the Carboniferous 
Limestone elsewhere.
Much later in date than the Canobie coal- 
seams are those that have been worked in East Cumberland and 
West Northumberland, from Brampton to Hexham, at Blenkinsop, 
Roachburn, Fourstones, and other places.
These coals are of the 
so-called Yoredale age ; the Little Limestone coal, named from its 
position just below a certain bed of limestone recognised over a 
large area, being the best known seam.
Lastly, we have the 
coals of the Whitehaven Coal-field, which may or may not be on 
the same geological horizon as the Coal Measures of the Newcastle 
Coal-fiehi, but which are certainly the latest in date, and the most 
important economically, in Cumberland.
And it is manifest that 
the coal-seams to be looked for beneath the Permian rocks of 
north-west Cumberland must be those of Maryport, Aspatria, and 
Bolton-Low-Houses.
When writing a short note last year, on " Coal Measures below 
the New Red Sandstone," for No. 8 of Transactions, it occurred 
to me that the subject was one that might be treated at somewhat 
greater length on this occasion.
Under any circumstances, how- 
ever, this matter is not one that can be discussed in much detail, 
inasmuch as the available facts bearing upon it are few in number, 
and such as allow us to draw but vague conclusions from them.
One great hindrance to full and definite knowledge consists of the 
thick covering of Glacial Drift which spreads alike over Coal 
Measures and Permian rocks, and allows but of the most scanty 
and imperfect observation of either at the surface, even in river 
valleys, or along the sea shore.
One result of this drift covering 
in north-west Cumberland that may be noted here is, that some 
beds of gypseous shales, known from borings to reach a thickness of 
of about seven hundred feet at Kelsick Moss, near Abbey Town, 
and half that thickness at Bowness-on-Solway, nowhere appear at 
the surface at all.
Their existence, in short, would be utterly 
unknown and unsuspected but for the borings that have revealed 
it.
In addition, the Kelsick Moss boring disclosed the fact that 
instead of the thirty or forty feet of drift that might have been 
expected, there were no less than two hundred feet.
The Permian 
(St. Bees) Sandstone is seen south of Kelsick Moss, about Aspatria 
and Brayton, to be dipping towards the Solway.
On the north, 
about Aniian, it is also dipping towards the Solway, or in the 
reverse direction.
Nothing but Glacial Drift is seen above the 
St. Bees Sandstone either north or south of Kelsick Moss.
Conse- 
quently all that surface observations could warrant us in predicting 
at Kelsick Moss would be the presence of St. Bees Sandstone 
below about forty or perhaps fifty feet of Glacial Drift.
Yet the 
top of the St. Bees Sandstone was reached not at a depth of forty, 
but of nearly nine hundred and forty feet.
Then, again, now that the existence of these Gypseous Shales 
is made known to us by borings, we are still prevented by the 
presence of superficial beds at the surface from being able to 
ascertain their lateral extent.
We do indeed see that the St. Bees 
Sandstone is uncovered by Gypseous Shales in a belt of- country 
Ill 
varying from one to two miles in breadth lying directly north 
of th-e Carboniferous-Permian boundary-line, between Maryport 
and the Caldew.* But north of Maryport, a walk along the 
southern shore of the Solway shows nothing but drift or alluvium 
from AUonby to Rockliffe.
And north of a straight line drawn 
from Allonby to Dalston, and west of the rivers Caldew and Eden, 
the only inland sections — excluding those showing superficial beds 
alone — are in the Lias country of Aikton and Orton.
North of 
the Allonby and Dalston line it is probable that the Gypseous 
Shales soon begin to come on above the St. Bees Sandstone, or 
they would be unlikely to attain a thickness of more than seven 
hundred feet at Kelsick Moss.
Whether they reach anything like 
their maximum thickness at Kelsick Moss must remain uncertain.
On looking at a map, it appears that while the Kelsick Moss boring 
is about nine-and -three-quarter miles south of the nearest northward 
exposure of St. Bees Sandstone — -on the Annan Water below 
Annan — it is only three miles north of the nearest section in that 
rock to the south — in the cutting west of Leegate Railway Station.
And considering also that the Gypseous Shales attain a thickness 
of three hundred and sixty-seven feet at Bowness, though St. Bees 
Sandstone appears at Tordoff Point and below Annan on the 
Scottish shore, I should be inclined to suppose them at their 
maximum in the neighbourhood of Newton Arlosh rather than 
that of Kelsick Moss.
But of course it is not improbable 
that no great difference may exist between the thickness 
of the Gypseous Shales at Kelsick, Newton .\rlosh, Whitrigg, 
Silloth, Pelutho, and other places that might be named.
The 
basin-shaped structure of the district is, I may remind you, shown 
in the way in which water, evidently derived from the St. Bees 
Sandstone, and flavoured by its passage through the Gypseous 
Shales, rises to the surface in the Kelsick borehole.
It is probable that any deep borehole on the coast between Bow- 
ness and Allonby would pass through a considerable thickness of 
Gypseous Shales before reaching the St. Bees Sandstone, the 
* A map showing this boundary line illustrates my paper on the Distinctive 
Colours of the Carboniferous and Permian rocks.

p. 79.

outcrop of the latter rock, beneath the sea, being some distance 
outside the present shore.
But the depth at which the Permian 
rocks lie beneath the level of the sea^prevents them from exercising 
any influence whatever on the shape of the coast line, and conse- 
quently from affording any indications as to their respective 
boundaries.
If we compare the prominence of the coast-Une 
close to Maryport with its recession in Allonby Bay, we see the 
difference between the effect of marine denudation on cliffs the 
base of which, at least, is red sandstone, and cliffs wholly composed 
of glacial drift.
But in and north of Allonby Bay the coast 
features are wholly drift features, and nowhere allow us to compare 
the effects of the sea on St. Bees Sandstone and on Gypseous 
Shales.
So much for the effects of the drift covering as a hindrance to 
knowledge of the rocks below.
But a more deep-seated hindrance 
lies in the decided unconformity of the Permian rocks to the 
underlying Carboniferous beds.
This unconformity impHes that 
before the deposition of the Permians, the Carboniferous rocks 
had been elevated and had become land.
That this elevation 
had been unequal in different places, and that in consequence 
of this inequality the rocks had suffered in very different 
degrees locally, both from the action of the sea during elevation, 
and of rain and rivers since the tract became dry land.
At a 
subsequent period the Carboniferous area became subject to a 
movement of depression, and the Permian rocks were deposited 
upon it.
Thus the relations of these two formations to each other 
are necessarily very different from those which would have existed 
had they been deposited in a slowly- and continuously subsiding 
area, no movement of upheaval having intervened.
For instead 
of the base of the Permian series being always on a particular 
geological horizon, it may rest at one place on the highest of the 
Carboniferous beds, at another on the lowest.
In other words — under 
the St. Bees Sandstone at Bowness, for example, may be rocks of 
Carboniferous Limestone age; under Kelsick Moss Coal Measures, 
or beds of Yoredale age — or just the reverse may occur.
And 
besides this uncertainty arising from the unconformity between 
113 
the Carboniferous and Permian formations, we must never forget 
that we know nothing whatever of the dislocations affecting the 
disposition of the Carboniferous beds north of the faulted boundary 
line.
For the superficial beds prevent us from seeing anything 
of most of those which affect the Permian, Trias and Lias ; while 
faults of the utmost magnitude may affect the Carboniferous 
series below, yet not extend into the Permian and other formations 
above.
While, if we may judge of the faults likely to exist in the 
Carboniferous rocks north of the Carboniferous-Permian boundary 
from those south of it, we may consider them likely to be both 
numerous and important.
And no help can be derived from 
observation of the Carboniferous rocks on the Scottish side of the 
Border, inasmuch as they are divided from those of the area under 
consideration either by a broad belt of Permian-covered ground, or 
by the waters of the Solway.
In addition to the unconformity between the Carboniferous and 
the Permian formations, we must not omit to consider that in the 
Coal-Measures themselves — the unconformity between the White- 
haven Sandstone and the beds on which it rests.
This of course 
implies that the base of the Whitehaven Sandstone may be on very 
different horizons at different places, and that coals existing below 
it at one spot may have been denuded away during its deposition 
at another.
The peculiar rock, mainly purple-grey in colour, 
known as the Whitehaven Sandstone, is well shown in the cliffs 
between the harbour at Whitehaven and St. Bees Head ; and the 
unconformity between it and the underlying measures is visible to 
any careful observer, and has been long recognised by geologists.
I do not think the magnitude and practical importance of this 
unconformity in any way comparable to that between the Carbon- 
iferous and the Permian formations, and consequently would deal 
with it very briefly but for one circumstance.
Mr. J.
D. Kendall, 
in the valuable paper read by him last year on " The Structure of 
the Cumberland Coal Field,"* includes in the term " Whitehaven 
Sandstone" not only the rock visible at Whitehaven, Rose Gill, 
and other places, which has long been considered to belong to it,

but all measures whatever that are, in the main, of a purple-grey 
colour.
Now the mere tint itself, without specific evidence of 
unconformity in each case, can give no presumption of any weight 
as regards affinity or age.
Its insignificance, indeed, is illustrated 
by Mr. Kendall's remark that "in the Whitehaven Sandstone these 
rocks (viz., sandstones and shales) are generally of a purple-grey 
colour, though in some places they include light sandstones and 
also light- and dark-coloured shales such as prevail in the Lower 
Coal-measures." For why, it may be asked, should the purple-grey 
colour, in such cases, be more entitled to weight, as showing 
Whitehaven Sandstone age, than the "light sandstones and also 
light and dark coloured shales, such as prevail in the Lower 
Coal-measures," as showing the reverse ?
Whatever the respective 
predominance of the tints, their coexistence points to the absence 
of any conditions, during deposition or since, excluding either 
hues.
It is quite possible that many patches of unquestionable 
Whitehaven Sandstone may exist not only in the Coal-field but far 
to the east of it, lying on beds of Millstone-Grit or of Yoredale age.
But considering the extraordinary diffusion of Carboniferous rocks, 
mainly purple-grey in colour, in Cumberland, it would be in the 
highest degree rash to consider rocks so tinted as belonging to the 
Whitehaven Sandstone, without evidence of unconformity in each 
case.
On the Esk, about Canobie, on the Liddel, in the railway 
cuttings between Riddings Junction and Penton, on the Line 
above Brackenhill Tower, in the district between the Petterill and 
the Caldew, and in Shawk Beck — to mention only a few localities 
— purple-grey rocks abound, or predominate.
Now it is utterly 
incredible that in the locahties named, there should be no evidence 
of a general unconformity dividing the purple-grey rocks from 
those of other tints, did it exist.
In Shawk Beck, south of the 
Carboniferous-Permian junction, there must be more than a 
thousand feet of Carboniferous rocks, mainly purple-grey.
Between 
the Sebergham and Rosley road and Nine Gills farm-house, there 
is an almost continuous series of sections in sandstones and shales, 
mainly of that colour, the dip being high, and regular as regards 
direction, all the way..
The presumption against the hypothesis 
115 
that these beds are lying unconformably on other Carboniferous 
strata below, is something enormous.
And it should not be 
forgotten that in any given case — such as this of Shawk Beck — 
the onus J>robandi is entirely on the side of the assertor of the 
unconformity.
I may be told, perhaps, that evidence on this head is given by 
Mr. Kendall in his sheet of vertical sections (PI.
xxxiii.) as regards 
the purple-grey beds of the Coal-field, at least.
But it seems to me 
that an impartial observer of the vertical sections could hardly fail 
to detect therein at least one point almost decisive in itself against 
its author's view.
Let us accept Mr. Kendall's correlation of the 
coal-seams, and compare the sections of BuUgill [and Aspatria.
We have as a base in each case the Yard Band.
Ascending from 
that horizon we notice (taking Mr. Kendall's own correlation) that 
a greater thickness of measures intervenes between the Yard and 
Cannel Bands at Aspatria than at Bullgill.
Above the Cannel the 
Metal Band and the Thirty-inch Band are correlated in the two 
pits, the greater thickness of the measures at Aspatria being still 
maintained.
Still ascending, the thin coal called the Rattler Band 
at Bullgill does not appear at Aspatria, though a bed, apparently 
of black or dark shale, lying a short distance below it, seems to be 
represented at the latter place, just where it might be expected.
Then the Ten Quarters Coal at Bullgill, seems to be naturally 
represented by a coal styled " Ten Quarters Coal of Bankend Pit," 
at Aspatria.
But Mr. Kendall has not drawn a Une connecting 
the Ten Quarters Coal at the two places, though the position of 
that seam at Aspatria is precisely uliere we should expect to see it, 
considering the thickening of the measures there, and noticing that 
a line connecting the coal at the two localities would have a 
direction almost perfectly parallel with those connecting the lower 
coals.
Above the Ten Quarters Coal, a series of coal and shaly 
beds at Bullgill appears (to me) to be represented by a somewhat 
thicker series at Aspatria, and a thickish sandstone at Bullgill by 
another somewhat thicker at Aspatria.
Then a not-very-well 
marked series is seen at both places, and the surface is reached at 
Aspatria.
But at Bullgill a series of beds not (it appears to mej 
116 
represented at all at Aspatria, being higher than any there, is seen.
Its uppermost member is a thick sandstone, which may very likely 
represent the Whitehaven Sandstone.
I have remarked that Mr. Kendall has shown his recognition of 
the thickening of the measures at Aspatria and of the correspond- 
ence of the lower coals at the two places by connecting lines, but 
that he has not joined the Ten Quarters Coal of BuUgill with that 
of Aspatria, though the latter is just where it should be, judging 
from the correlation of the lower coals.
The explanation seems to 
be that, according to some singular preconception on Mr. Kendall's 
part, the Ten Quarters Coal of Aspatria ought to be in the White- 
haven Sandstone.
He has accordingly placed the base of that 
rock at Aspatria, just above the Thirty-inch Coal ; while at BuU- 
gill it is very much higher, being many fathoms above the Ten 
Quarters.
Now while we carry upward Mr. Kendall's correlation 
of the lower coals, and keep our lines to the top of the Aspatria 
pit, nearly parallel with his, we meet with no difficulty ; the reverse 
is the case if we adopt his view as to the base of the Whitehaven 
Sandstone.
For the sections in his supposed Whitehaven Sand- 
stone are utterly unlike each other.
And it is curious to note that 
taking Mr. Kendall's line for the base of the Whitehaven Sandstone 
at EUenborough, Bullgill, and Aspatria ; we find that the two 
places most distant from each other show the nearest correspond- 
ence, as regards that rock, the intermediate place, Bullgill, differing 
more from the two others than they do from each other.
In fact, 
a glance at the sheet of sections generally will produce the 
impression (I think) that the upper beds at Bullgill differ decidedly 
from those of EUenborough, Aspatria, and Bolton, *nd resemble 
those ot Cleator Moor and Whitehaven.
And that if the upper 
beds at Cleator Moor, Whitehaven, and Bullgill belong to the 
Whitehaven Sandstone series, those of EUenborough, Aspatria, 
and Bolton do not.
In any case, as the upper beds at the three last-named places 
all contain coals of more or less importance, it is highly improbable 
that the Whitehaven Sandstone has had any wide-spread influence 
in removing the upper coal-seams on the other side of the 
117 
Carboniferous-Permian fault, at least within a certain distance of 
that boundary.
And I may add with regard to Mr. Kendall's paper, that its 
merits as a most valuable collection of important facts relating to 
the coal-field are so great, that, supposing my criticisms on his 
Whitehaven Sandstone theory to be proved true to the fullest 
extent, the damage thereby done to the paper would be com- 
paratively trifling.
But of course its very importance obliges me 
to discuss it here so far as it has any bearing on my subject.
From looking at the more important lines of fault abutting 
against those which form the Carboniferous-Permian boundary 
little or nothing can be learned, inasmuch as it is impossible to 
guess which fault has a continued existence under the St. Bees 
Sandstone.
Similarly it is impossible to say which of the two 
boundary lines of fault which meet a little north of Bolton Low 
Houses, is prolonged under the Permians, or whether both are, or 
neither.
One thing may be mentioned, however, as regards this 
locality.
The coals worked in Bolton Colliery may be looked for 
beneath the St. Bees Sandstone on the northern side of the 
boundary fault ; and, indeed, any coals worked anywhere in the 
coal-field up to that fault may be expected below the St. Bees 
Sandstone on its other side, at a considerably increased depth.
In conclusion, I will mention a few things that should be borne 
in mind by any searcher for coal beneath the Permians.
First, 
that borings east of Wigton are not likely to be of much use, as 
the measures which will probably be met with, though not entirely 
destitute of coals, are not to be compared in that respect with those 
further west.
Secondly, that south and south-west of Wigton 
prudent persons will keep within a mile or thereabouts of the 
[faulted boundary.
The advantages of this course, as compared 
[with boring further to the north, are unquestionable.
For though 
[we may fairly assume, as I have already remarked, that coals 
[worked up to the faulted boundary on the southern, or upthrow 
side, will be met again on the downthrow, or northern side, at a 
[considerably increased depth, we cannot reckon that this will be 
true a considerable distance from the fault.
And a similar remark 
118 
may be made as regards the Coal Measures generally.
For in 
consequence of the unconformity of the overlying Permians to the 
Carboniferous beds, the St. Bees Sandstone may rest on Upper 
Coal Measures at a given place — Aspatria, for instance — and three 
miles northward on beds altogether below the Coal Measures 
(Fig. i).
Again, as we go north of the boundary we may expect 
Jl Spain a.
to meet not only with a greater thickness of St. Bees Sandstone, 
but with the Gypseous Shales, and probably with a thicker covering 
of drift.
And though the Gypseous Shales may come on gradually 
above the St. Bees Sandstone, it is by no means improbable that 
their southern boundary is a line of fault, with a downthrow to the 
north, ranging nearly parallel with that which bounds the Permian 
formation, and with that which, still further south, brings in the 
Coal-Measures between High Hall and Gilcrux (Fig. 2).
For 
JfspaA:ri.a 
FloX.
though we have no evidence of the existence of any fault bringing 
in the Gypseous Shales (as we have in the case of the lower 
formations), yet considering the known tendency in the leading 
lines of fault in a district to take certain prevalent directions, one 
is by no means unlikely to exist.
And the consequences of boring 
on the wrong side of a fault are somewhat discouraging and calcu- 
119 
lated to check exploration, and consequently to prevent the growth 
of geological knowledge.
It is therefore better in every way that 
exploratory borings should first be made in ground where there is 
evidently nothing but Glacial Drift above the St. Bees Sandstone.
They may then be tried in the more doubtful ground to the north 
without risk of undue discouragement, and with the possibility 
that, owing to faults, or folds in the Carboniferous rocks, a more 
favourable state of things may be revealed than could fairly be 
expected.
And, whether pecuniarily successful or not, speculative 
borers in this region cannot fail to add materially to our knowledge 
of the geology of the most obscure and sectionless district in all 
Cumberland.

NOTES ON SOME CARBONIFEROUS GASTEROPODA 
FROM PENTON AND ELSEWHERE.
By Miss DONALD, Stanwix, Carlisle.
The fossils about to be described were mostly obtained from a bed 
of calcareous shale, belonging to the Calciferous Sandstone Series, 
at Penton, on the Border about fifteen miles north-east of Carlisle.
Associated with the Gasteropoda are representatives of the 
Actinozoa, Crinoidea, Annelida, Ostracoda, Trilpbita, Polyzoa, 
Brachiopoda, LamelHbranchiata, Heteropoda, and Cephalopoda.
Remains of fish also occur, and I have obtained a specimen of their 
palatal teeth, as well as part of the lower jaw of Megalichthys.
The 
fossils are crowded together on the bedding faces of the shales, 
but few or none of them appear to be much worn, and they are 
often so little disturbed that specimens of Encrinites and similar 
fossils are occasionally found almost entire.
It would therefore 
appear that the strata where these fossils occur represent the result 
of quiet deposition in the waters of the sea, at least at some distance 
from land, if not actually in comparatively-deep water.
Some of the other fossils described were obtained from an 
ochraceous bed whose present condition results from the partial 
decomposition of a bed of impure ferruginous limestone.
This 
occurs near Mosedale, on the north slopes of VViddle Fell, just 
beyond the county boundary of Westmorland, and about a mile to 
the south-east of Hawes Junction, on the Midland Railway.
Mr.
Goodchild informs me that this bed represents the equivalent of 
what is known as the Three Yard Limestone in the Yoredale 
128 
Rocks in Cumberland and Westmorland.
In this deposit great 
numbers of fossils are crowded together, as at Penton, and they 
include quite as great a variety of forms.
Owing, however, to the 
fact that the calcareous portion of the rock has been carried away 
in solution through weathering, the fossils in this instance are 
represented chiefly by impressions of the exterior, together with 
casts of the original vacancies.
By carefully clearing away the 
extraneous matter, and then pressing modelling-wax into the 
cavities left by the shells, impressions are obtained which reproduce 
all the original relief of the shell, even to minute details only 
discernible under a lens of high magnifying power.
Fossil remains of Gasteropoda rarely present any traces of 
muscular impressions, or of such structures as in other MoUusca 
are available as guides to the zoological position of the animals 
that formed them.
The opercula, where such originally existed, 
are but seldom found, and the lingual dentition is in nearly every 
case quite unknown.
Hence we are compelled to rely, for the 
determination pf generic or of specific characters, upon the data — 
most of them unsatisfactory at the best — that are furnished by the 
external characters alone.
Amongst these external characters, the form of the mouth, and 
especially the form of the outer lip, is one of the features of greatest 
value, as indicating, to some extent, structural differences in the 
animal that formed the shell.
But a perfect mouth to a shell is 
rare in the fossil state, and we are therefore obliged to make a 
close examination of the structural feature that represents, in itself, 
a succession of positions occupied by the edge of the outer lip.
They are represented by the lines of growth.
And even these are 
not always of such a nature as to furnish evidence of much value, 
as individual specimens of such shells as usually display well-marked 
lines of growth, occasionally have them obliterated.
It therefore 
becomes necessary, before stating any conclusion with regard to the 
specific or other relations of fossil Gasteropoda, to make a careful 
examination of a large number of specimens.
In the case of the species about to be described, I have made a 
.careful study of nearly the whole of the literature on the subject, 
129 
and have personally examined specimens in the British Museum, 
the Museum of Practical Geology, the Museum of the Geological 
Society, the Woodwardian Museum, the Museum of the Geological 
Survey of Scotland, as well as other pubhc collections located at 
York, Liverpool, Leeds, &c.
Mr. John Young, of the Hunterian 
Museum, Glasgow, has been most kind, both in allowing me to 
study his private collection, and in giving me specimens to com- 
pare with my own.
Most of the shells whose description follows, have been at one 
time or another described under the generic name of Murchisonia.
In many instances it is clear that this identification has been 
founded upon error.
In 1841, Viscount D'Archiac and M.
E. de Verneuil {Bulletin de 
la Soc. Geol.
de France, t.
xii.
p. 154,) gave the name of Murchi- 
sonia to a group of elongated shells of which the outer lip is 
notched, and the mouth is effuse below.
Subsequently, Salter, in 
1859, {Geol.
Survey of Catiada, Dec. i, p.
18,) distinguishes from the 
true Murchisonice a group of beaded shells having the outer lip 
notched, but with the mouth rounded and not effuse below.
To these 
he gives the name Hormotoma; and H.
gracilis, a Silurian form, may 
be taken as the type.
There is another group of shells bearing 
considerable external resemblance to Murchisonia, to which Messrs.
Meek and Worthen in 1861 ( Proc.
Acad.
Nat. Sci.
Phil.
p. 146,^ 
have given the name Orthonema.
These shells are elongated, and 
they are generally ornamented with keels ; but the outer lip is 
straight and is not notched; hence the lines of growth come 
straight down the whorls without any trace of the deep sinus 
characteristic of the true Murchisonice.
Some small elongated 
beaded shells, ornamented with keels, or with rows of tubercles, 
were sometimes included in the genus Murchisonia, and at other 
times were referred to Loxonema, Turritella, Aclis, Turbonilla, etc.
These shells M.
de Koninck {Annales du Musee Royal UHistoire 
Naturelle de Belgique, T.
vi.
3me Partie, p.
86, 1881,) now groups 
under the generic name of Aclisina.
In this genus the mouth 
is oval, and the outer lip is entire, instead of being notched as it 
is in Murchisonia.

130 
To the genus Loxonema, Phillips {Pal. Foss.
p. 98, 1841), belong 
elongated shells devoid of spiral keels, having the edge of the 
outer lip sigmoidal in form, with its general direction inclined 
several degrees to the right of the apex of the shell.
The whorls 
are usually ornamented with raised threads or with ribs, which 
approximate in general direction with the lines of growth, and are 
therefore sigmoidal in form, like the edge of the outer lip.
No 
trace of anything approaching a notch or sinus ever exists in this 
genus.
Many of the species bear a close resemblance to certain 
members of the genus Melania.
Genus Loxonema (Phillips).
Shell elongated, spiral ; whorls more or less convex, their upper 
edges adpressed against the next above.
Mouth longer than wide, 
attenuated above, effuse below, with a sigmoidal edge to the outer 
lip.
The whorls are ornamented with longitudinal threads or ribs, 
generally arched like the lines of growth ; and they are always 
devoid of spiral keels.

Turitella urei, Fleming, 1828, British Animals, p.

Shell very small and slender, composed of about eleven whorls, 
which are flattened on their upper surface, and are convex below.
They are each ornamented with fifteen or sixteen slightly sigmoidal 
ribs, which are inclined at a small angle to the axis of the shell.
These ribs are strong in proportion to the size of the shell.
No 
umbilicus.
In the Catalogue of the Western Scottish Fossils, p.

has been entered in the genus Murchisonia, the longitudinal ribs 
and the absence of a slit in the outer lip having been overlooked.* 
It was briefly described by Fleming (Brit.

Shell elongated, of ten to twelve convex whorls, separated by 
deep sutures.
The whorls are ornamented with from ten to fourteen 
grooves, separated by the same number of threads.
These grooves 
vary in width and depth, and the threads also vary in strength, 
giving the shell a peculiar appearance, which causes it to be easily 
distinguished from any others of the genus.
The disposition and 
number of wide- and narrow grooves vary on different individuals.
The strongest thread and the widest groove occur about the centre 
of the whorls on this specimen.
The mouth is imbedded in the 
matrix in the individual examined.
I have found only one specimen of this species, which occurs at 
Penton.
There are several specimens of it from the Carboniferous 
Limestone of Settle, in the museums at Cambridge, South Ken- 
sington, Leeds, and York ; and all these are much larger than the 
specimens from Penton.
Mr. Young has specimens in his collection 
from the shales of the Lower Limestone Series of Craigenglen, and 
from the shales of the Upper Limestone Series of Swindridge

Shell small, elongated, slender, of thirteen to at least sixteen 
whorls, which are slightly flattened above and convex below.
The 
whorls are each ornamented with from seven to nine keels, which, 
on some individuals, are separated by nearly-equal spaces ; the 
widest space, however, is generally just above the middle of the 
whorl.
Sometimes the two spaces next above are equally-wide ; 
133 
while the spaces between the five or six keels on the lower part of 
the whorl are much narrower.
The two uppermost keels are the 
slightest, and they are occasionally absent.
This variation in the 
disposition of the keels is observed on different individuals occur- 
ring in the same stratum.
The lines of growth are not very 
distinct, but they are visible under a magnifier.
The mouth is 
nearly round.
This shell was figured by the Rev. David Ure {^History of 
Rutherglen and East Kilbride, PI.

afterwards briefly described by Fleming as Turritella elongata, {Brit.

comparatively rare.

Shell small, elongated, slender, of thirteen to fifteen whorls, of 
which the upper part is slightly flattened, and the lower convex.
There are four strong keels on the lower part of each whorl, and 
frequently another slightly-finer one below, which is hidden beneath 
the suture on the upper whorls.
On the upper flattened part of 
each whorl another keel is generally placed below the suture, and 
between this keel and the uppermost of the others is the widest 
space.
This keel is occasionally absent.
Lines of growth not

aid of a magnifier, when a strong light is cast obliquely on the 
surface of the specimen under examination.
The mouth is nearly 
round, and the columella is slightly thickened.
This shell bears some resemblance to A.
elongata, but the keels 
are decidedly stronger, as well as less numerous.
From Loxonenia 
polygyra, M'Coy, it differs in its more numerous whorls, and in 
the keels being placed at unequal distances on.

Shell elongated, turreted, composed of from thirteen to fifteen 
gradually-increasing angular whorls.
Each whorl is ornamented 
with five keels, of which the middle one is placed rather below the 
centre, and it is the most prominent.
On full grown shells the 
widest space is generally between the uppermost keel and that 
next below ; specimens of about ten whorls frequently have the 
spaces between the keels nearly equal ; and small shells have the 
widest space between the central keel and that next above.
Occa- 
sionally the uppermost keel is faint, or absent altogether.
In 
addition to the five keels, M.
L. G.
De Koninck describes two 
more below on the body whorl ; but there is not more than one 
extra keel on any of my specimens.
There is also, on some speci- 
mens, a fine line between the central keel and that next above on 
all the whorls.
The lines of growth are distinct on many specimens ; 
they are nearly straight, and they pass over the keels without any 
indication of a sinus.
Some of the lines are so strong as to cause 
the keels to be somewhat crenulated on some specimens.
Mouth 
imperfectly preserved ; it appears to be rather longer than wide, 
and the peristome is incomplete.
No umbiHcus.
I sent a specimen of this shell from Penton, and also of one 
from Mosedale, to M.
L. G.
De Koninck, who kindly identified 
them with his Murchisonia quitiquecarinata.
In the Annales du 
Musee Royal D'Histoire Naturalle de Belgique, T.
viii., 4me Partie, 
p. 14, he states that some of the shells described as Murchisonia 
may possibly prove to belong to the genus Orthonema; but owing 
to the imperfect preservation of some of them, he was unable to 
decide this question.
The preservation of the lines of growth on 
the specimens from Penton proves that this surmise is correct, for 
the outer lip, as indicated by the lines of growth, must have been 
.entire, and these shells, therefore, can no longer be retained in the 
genus Murchisonia.

Length of specimen figured, i6 mm.; breadth of body whorl,

Other shells from Penton would be 'larger if perfect.
The specimens from Mosedale are much smaller; the largest I 
have found, if perfect, would only be about 6 mm.
in length.
Locality and Horizon.
— This shell is tolerably abundant in the 
Calciferous Sandstone Series at Penton.
1 have collected more 
than sixty specimens there, in different stages of growth.
Mr.
Young has specimens in his collection from the shales of the Lower 
Limestone Series of Craigenglen.
They are about the same size 
as those from Penton, and the lines of growth are preserved on 
many of them.
He has also small shells from the shales of the 
Upper Limestone Series of Robroyston.
I have also portions of 
several shells from the Yoredale Shales near Askrigg, Wensley 
Dale, which are of nearly the same dimensions as those from 
Penton.
Small casts occur in the Yoredale Rocks at Mosedale, 
on the north slopes of Widdle Fell.

THE POETS AND POETRY OF CUMBERLAND, 
INCLUDING THE CUMBRIAN BORDER.
By the Rev. T.
ELLWOOD, B.A.
(Read at Ambleside.) 
To understand the style and spirit of Cumbrian Border Poetry, it 
will be necessary to take a brief retrospect of Cumbrian history ; 
and we find therefrom that the position of Cumberland has been 
isolated and unsettled from the very first dawn of authentic 
history.
In the time of the Heptarchy, it was not a Saxon but a Celtic 
kingdom, and included Westmorland and a portion of Lancashire, 
and is said at one time to have extended as far as the Dee. At 
one time the respective Celtic kingdoms of Cornwall, of Wales, 
and of Cumberland, may have extended in an unbroken line 
along the western portion of England.
And though gradually 
receding, yet for a long time Morecambe Bay formed the southern 
limit of the kingdom of Cumberland, which would still therefore 
include Westmorland and Furness ; and if you look at the map, it 
would almost seem as if Nature had intended them to be one.
They are one in a great measure in the physical aspect of the 
country, diversified as it is by mountains, lakes, and valleys ; 
one in the cautious, sturdy, independent, and hospitable character 
of their inhabitants ; and one in a great measure — at any rate, till 
you get upon the Border line — in the well-known dialect which 
characterises and identifies the race.
This kingdom of Cumbria, then, which had been a Scottish 
138 
possession until the time of Malcolm Kenmore, was, in 1091, 
made over to England ; and this from the 1 1 th to the end of the 
17th century formed upon its northern frontier a scene of unceasing 
warfare and bloodshed.
Along the Border there is a tract of land between the Esk and 
the Sark for a long time claimed by both kingdoms, and upon this 
' territory, for centuries, club-law prevailed.
Two leading families — Scott upon the Scottish, and Dacre upon 
the Cumbrian frontiers, were the chiefs of their respective counties 
in time of actual warfare.
The right of might prevailed almost 
universally upon the Border ; and, from the peer to the peasant, 
every man was equally ready to take part in a fray.
A verse from one of the Cumbrian Border Ballads will show the 
character of the warfare, and introduces the Border hero, Belted 
Will :— 
The warder has look'd from the old grey tower, 
And unto his Lord he said, 
"The mosstroopers come with a terrible power.
And a champion at their head.
" 
" Now by my sword," said that gallant lord, 
" We'll meet them in the field ; 
Let each man show his might in the fight, 
And the traitors be they who yield." 
Scattered all over the Border, and so far inland as to include 
Westmorland, were buildings consisting of a square tower of three 
floors — the lowest one used for the reception of cattle, the higher, 
consisting of a single apartment each, for the reception of the 
family.
Doubtless some of you will, like myself, have seen them, 
and know therefore that they were pierced with narrow loopholes, 
for the purposes of defence.
It is difficult to number those lesser castles or peels.
The house 
of every man even of moderate estate was literally his castle ; and 
very many have been long since levelled and forgotten, or are only 
incidentally mentioned in the scanty local records, or are disclosed 
by the names they bear.
It has been much the custom to include 
139 
the old towers in the modern houses ; so that nothing of them is 
visible, and their presence is only revealed by the exceptional 
thickness of their walls, as shown on a plan.
Many of the old 
residences of this kind have been pointed out in either county, for 
it has been truly said — scratch a Cumberland or Westmorland 
squire's house, and you find a peel.
In the immediate neighbourhood of the Border line, the trade 
of many of these people was cattle lifting ; and this in some 
measure formed the basis of their system of operations, — that when 
a Cumbrian had his house plundered of a cow, he went over the 
Border and helped himself to another cow, or, possibly, if he 
thought the one he was taking was not quite equal in value to the 
one he had lost, he might appropriate two or even three of the 
Scotchman's cattle, without being particularly anxious about 
determining whether the Scotchman from whose herd he had 
made the selection was the same Scotchman that had walked off 
with his before.
A verse from the Rydal Poet will show that club-law, and 
inability to distinguish between meum and iuum was by no means 
confined to the unquiet spirits upon the Scottish and English 
Border.
For — 
A famous man is Robin Hood, 
The English ballad-singer's joy !
And Scotland has a thief as good, 
An outlaw of as daring mood ; 
She boasts her brave Kob Roy !
If I wished to name a Border hero fitted to form a parallel to 
these two famed freebooters from the interior of England and 
Scotland, I should name Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie Tower, 
near Langholm.
He certainly was "a thief as good," and the 
Border "ballad-singers' joy,' for he figures most largely in all the 
Border songs and ballads of the period, and his expeditions were 
at one time so extended, that at the head of a desperate band of 
eight-score followers, he has been known to spread terror as far 
south as the limits of Westmorland — northwards to Edinburgh, 
and eastwards to Newcastle.
140 
His death, like his life, has formed the source of many ballads 
and songs in the Border Poetry, and has been related in many 
different ways.
King James of Scotland is said to have decoyed 
him to his court with fair promises ; and when he went into his 
presence with his armed retinue, in all the pomp and splendour of 
Border magnificence, the king cried out, " What wants this knave 
with an equipment fit only for a king ?
Away with him !
away 
with him !
" Johnnie and his followers were accordingly con- 
demned to instant execution ; — and tradition says that the trees 
upon which they were hung, between Langholm and Hawick, 
shortly afterwards withered away.
Another ballad, however, gives 
a different version of the story ; it makes Johnnie and his men 
fight it out with the king, till the king was so hard pressed that all 
Edinburgh had to turn out and help him ; then Johnnie got the 
worst of it.
He and his followers were all killed, except one — one 
generally escapes on such occasions.
So there they fought courageously.
Till most of them lay dead and slain ; 
But little Musgrave, that was his foot page, 
With his bonny horse Grizzel got away untain.
He made for home as fast as possible ; and when he had told 
the sad news, Armstrong's son, who was evidently a chip off the 
old block, resolved upon a future revenge : — 
Oh then up spake his little son.
Who sat upon his nurse's knee — 
"If ever I live to be a man, 
My father's death avenged shall be !" 
I have to remark in passing, that he is spoken of throughout 
this ballad, and other ballads, as Johnnie Armstrong of Westmor- 
land ; and the question was asked in one of the local papers not 
long ago — who he was ?
and why he should be associated with 
Westmorland.
The reply is obvious enough.
Langholm and the 
Cumberland Borders consist in a great measure of moss and moor- 
land ; it lies towards the west of the island, and was hence in 
general terms called west-moor-land.
Such I believe to have 
141 
been the origin of the term as then applied to that district on the 
Border, and such I beUeve — notwithstanding very learned opinions 
given to the contrary — to have been the original significance of 
the term as applied to the county in which we are.
We have grouped together by the hand of a master, some of the 
most prominent characters who formed the subject of Cumbrian 
Border song, in the Lay of the Last Minstrel of Sir Walter Scott — 
Buccleuch, Lord Howard or " Belted Will," and Lord Dacre, are 
all brought before us in their character of Border chieftains.
The 
gathering of the Cumbrian and Scottish Border clans by the signal 
of the long line of bale-fires* which, when occasion required, could 
speedily send their light from the German Ocean to the Solway, is 
there very forcibly illustrated ; while another name noted in Cum- 
brian legend and song is introduced in the person of the world- 
renowned wizard, Michael Scott.
The terrible consequences that 
resulted from the opening of his tomb at Melrose, may serve to 
show what the Border ballad singers thought about his supposed 
power of enchantment ; — though I may remark that another well 
known Abbey — that of Holm Cultram, upon the Cumberland side 
of the Border — lays claim to him as one of its prelates, and as 
having furnished his last resting place when he died.
This poem gives a vivid sketch of the scenes of warfare which 
for many an age gave the tone and character to Cumberland songs, 
ballads, and legends ; and Sir Walter Scott has incorporated into 
the narrative old Cumberland ballads and songs which he obtained 
upon the Border ready made to his hand.
I may instance his 
description of the gathering upon the Borders, his account of 
Lord Dacre and Belted Will, and the song which he introduces — 
"The Sun shines fair on Carlisle wall." 
Wat Tinlinn, who is introduced therein, may well serve as the 
* The startling suddenness with which the light of those Border bale-fires 
rose at times upon the horizon is thus described in the Lay of the Last Minstrel.
Canto III., 25.
Is yon the star o'er Penchryst Pen, 
That rises slowly to her ken, — 
And spreading broad its wavering light, 
Shakes its loose tresses on the night ?
Is yon red glare the western star ?
O, 'tis the beacon-blaze of war !
142 
type of the mosstroopers of Cumberland poetry ; and it matters 
little whether he is placed upon the Scottish or upon the Cumbrian 
side of the Border, for, when occasion served, he could plunder 
with equal facility from either or from both ; for — 
A stark moss-trooping Scot was he, 
As e'er couched Border lance by knee ; 
Through Solway sands, through Tarras moss, 
Blindfold he knew the paths to cross ; 
By wily turns, by desperate bounds.
Had bafifled Percy's best blood-hounds ; 
In Esk or Liddel, fords were none, 
But he would ride them one by one.
Alike to him was time or tide, 
December's snow, or July's pride ; 
Alike to him was tide or time.
Moonless midnight, or matin prime ; 
Steady of heart, and stout of hand.
As ever drove prey from Cumberland ; 
Five times outlawed had he been 
By England's king, and Scotland's queen.
My next quotation, though in the style and times of Border 
Poetry, will bring us a good deal nearer home.
Miss Harriet 
Martineau, by an inquiry in one of the early numbers of Notes and 
Queries, obtained a ballad about which she had given the following 
notes.
"About the middle of the seventeenth century, occasionally 
resided on the large island in Windermere a member of the 
ancient but now extinct family of Philipson of Crooke Hall.
He 
was a dashing cavalier, and, from his fearless exploits, had acquired 
among the Parliamentarians the significant though not very 
respectable cognomen of 'Robin the Devil' On one of these 
characteristic adventures, he rode, heavily armed, into the large 
old church of Kendal, with the intention of there shooting an 
individual from whom he had received a deeply-resented injury.
His object, however, was unaccomplished, for his enemy was not 
present ; and in the confusion into which the congregation were 
thrown by such a warlike apparition, the dauntless intruder made 
his exit, though subjected to a struggle at the church door.
His 
143 
casque, which was captured in the skirmish which there took 
place, is yet to be seen in the church; and the fame of this 
redoubtable attempt, which was long held in remembrance through 
the country side, excited the poetic genius of a rhymer of the day 
to embody it in a ballad entitled ' Dick and the Devil,' which is 
now rare and difficult to be met with." The enemy of Philipson 
mentioned above was Colonel Briggs, a leading magistrate of 
Kendal, and an active commander in the Cromwellian army.
The ballad describing this scene is as follows : — 
He leaped on his beaste, and he rode with heaste, 
To male his black oath good ; 
'Twas the Lord's day, and the folks did pray, 
And the priest in chancel stood.
The door was wide, and in does he ride, 
In his clanking gear so gay ; 
A long keen brand, he held in his hand.
Our Dickon for to slay.
Our Dickon, goodhap, he was not there.
And Robin he rode in vain ; 
And the men got up, that were kneeling in prayer, 
To take him by might and main.
Robin swung his sword, his steed he spurred.
He plunged right through the thrang, 
But the stout smith Jock, with his old mother's crutch.
He gave him a woundy bang.
So hard he smote the iron pot.
It came down plume and all ; 
Then with bare head, away Robin sped, 
And himself was fit to fall.
Robin a devil he way'd him home.
And if for his foes he search, 
I think that again he will not come 
To late them in Kendal church.
It must be borne in mind that these scenes, which, unfortunately, 
were by no means unfrequent in England, (see Woodstock of Sir 
Walter Scott,) occurred at a time when the Royalist and Episco- 
144 
palian party were being deprived of their churches by the Round- 
heads — in the time of the CromweUian Revolution — and it cannot 
be wondered at that they should now and then show reluctance in 
giving up what they considered to be their own, or refuse to 
relinquish them without a struggle.
These Philipsons of Crooke Hall and the island upon Winder- 
mere, are noted elsewhere.
Dr. Gibson, who was for many years 
our Coniston writer and poet, in a long ballad, entitled, "The 
Skulls of Culgaith," describes how a fatal curse was pronounced 
upon that same family for its over-reaching injustice.
And a 
gentleman — Mr. Rawnsley — who, the last time I was here, 
delivered an address upon Lake District Defence, from this 
platform, in his volume of very interesting sonnets upon Lakeland, 
has written a piece upon these Skulls of Culgaith, in which he 
follows in pretty much the same tack.
Thus the Philipsons have 
called forth the attention of not less than three of our poets to 
their decline and fall.
Speaking of the fortunes of families, I am reminded of a theme 
which in a varied form has often afforded a subject for Cumberland 
legend and poetry, and is connected with the luck of castles 
and other baronial residences.
Often a cup or goblet is retained 
there, and known as the luck of the place.
Thus we have the 
Luck of Muncaster, in a goblet said to have been given to the 
Pennington family by Henry VII.
Goblets connected with the 
luck of other houses have been handed down in the same way.
Possibly the most famed both in legend and poetry is that famous 
goblet called the Luck of Edenhall.
The best known legend on the subject is, that one of the 
Musgraves rushed in amongst the festive revels of a band of fairies 
and seized and gallopped off with their goblet.
There was a chase 
of course — very much in the style of the chase described in "Tam 
o' Shanter;" and Musgrave, like Tam, made for the running 
stream, for he knew that the fairies would be powerless to cross it.
He succeeded in crossing the stream in a more fortunate condition 
than the hero of Burns — for his mare carried over it both the 
145 
goblet and her tail.
The fairies, however, sent this parting denun- 
ciation after him as he crossed the stream : — 
If this cup should break or fall.
Farewell the Luck of Edenhall.
And words to that effect are still inscribed upon the goblet.
He 
is said to have been so exhausted when he reached his home, that 
the cup dropped out of his hand, and the butler saved it from 
being broken by catching it ere it fell to the ground.
It has been 
embodied in a ballad commencing — 
A sudden thought fires Musgrave's brain, 
So help him all ye powers of light : 
He rushes to the festive train, 
And snatches up the goblet bright.
With three brave bounds the lawn he cross'd — 
The fourth it mounts him on his steed.
Run, courser, or thy Lord is lost !
Stretch to the stream with lightning's speed !
Uhland, the German national poet, has written a song or ballad 
upon this same Luck of Edenhall, only he describes it as having 
been originally snatched from the water nymphs or fairies (and the 
goblets of water nymphs are possibly more fortunate in preserving 
the luck of families than those used by spirits of a more potent 
spell).
He has thrown an air of German mysticism over the 
legend, for he makes fire to issue from the walls of the castle at 
the same moment that the goblet is shivered, by being brought 
down upon the table with a kling klang.
Longfellow has made a translation of this ballad from the 
German of Uhland ; attracted possibly, amongst other things, by 
its connexion with Cumberland ; for I remember when Longfellow 
visited England, and came over to Cumberland, he claimed to 
be a Cumberland man, in that he was born at Cumberland in 
Massachusetts.
Hitherto I have spoken of poetry rather than ot poets ; and 
ballads or poetry, which, like the restless spirits that form its 
leading subjects, may be looked upon as belonging to either side 
11 
U6 
of the Border line — Cumberland or Dumfriesshire — and expressed 
in a measure and dialect which are at times less Cumbrian than 
Scotch.
I now turn to the Poets and Poetry of Cumberland properly 
so called.
Their dialect is the dialect of Cumberland and Lake- 
land, without connexion with Scotland and the Borders, and their 
pieces valuable, not perhaps so much on account of any intrinsic 
excellence, as from the fact that tliey give us a reflex of Cumberland 
and Westmorland manners and customs without interruption for 
almost two centuries ; in that they have embalmed in rhyme and 
rhythm a dialect which the rapid advances of civilization, the 
increased intercourse brought into the most out-of-the-way places 
by railways; and lastly, but by no means leastly — the rooting out 
of the dialect by the compulsory school system, will speedily make 
it to become one of the things that have been.
And yet we 
Cumbrians, and I may venture to add — some of you of West- 
morland, cling to it.
The dialect speaks to us of home and friends.
The kind words of a father and a mother were first spoken to us 
in the dialect ; and we still remember them in our heart in the 
dialect, with all their utterances of care, of kindness, and of love.
It is the dialect that speaks to us of all the familiar scenes and 
doings of our childhood and boyhood.
And when separated by 
the hard fate of circumstances, Cumbrians again meet in far distant 
lands, it may be among men speaking a far different language, it is 
often the dialect, with its masonic significance, that reminds them 
— far distant from home though they are — of their bond of brother- 
hood, and teaches them that in their case, at any rate — 
Man to man, the wide world o'er, 
Shall brithers be for a' that.
We can trace the Cumbrian poets down in almost unbroken 
succession from the year 1700 until the present time.
It is an 
advantage to them in their representative character, that they have 
sprung from almost every class, and filled almost every rank in 
their native county.
We have the quiet and retiring country clergyman and school- 
147 
master leaving his pupils at the close of a hard day's teaching, to 
go and muse in his church or on the banks of a quiet streamlet, 
and then committing his musings to writing, to be found, and 
published, long after his early death.
Then we have the blind 
fiddler, fiddling away life to a merry tune, and writing down in 
verse his experience as the musician of the party at the dances, 
hakes, and merry-nights which he had himself enlivened.
Then 
we have two ladies — Miss Blamire and Miss Gilpin — occupying a 
high position in the county, and, like Beaumont and Fletcher, 
cementing their friendship by pieces of poetry which, in some 
instances, seem to have been their joint composition.
Then the 
keen huntsman dashing off " D'ye ken John Peel 1 " with as much 
facility as he dashed off one of the notices of a hunting appoint- 
ment.
Then, in Mark Lonsdale, one who was at times a play 
writer, a play actor, and a teacher, and who in this varied capacity 
wandered about over great part of England and Ireland, but one 
who shows by his terse sketches in the dialect, how well, amid all 
changes, and how closely, he clung to home words and home 
scenes.
In Sanderson, whose memory Wordsworth has embalmed in one 
of his terse and enduring sketches, we have the history of a recluse 
who, after contributing poetry for almost half a century to Cum- 
berland papers and periodicals, was, together with most of his 
writings, burned in a fire that consumed his cottage.
In Anderson, the Cumberland contemporary of Burns, we have 
what may be called the Burns of Cumberland.
Like Burns, giving, 
in his songs and ballads, truthful sketches of the every-day life of 
the peasantry of his native county.
Like Burns, living at times, 
despite his poetic powers, in a state of extreme penury ; and the 
parallel between them is still more strongly marked in their 
departing moments — for they both died in a state of fear and 
apprehension, the one of the workhouse, the other of a gaol.
We have schoolmasters of almost every class — Lonsdale, Rayson, 
Clark, and Richardson — giving expression in the poetry of the 
dialect to their intimate acquaintance with the scenes and doings 
of their native county.
148 
We have in Dr. Gibson a gentleman who lived long in our own 
neiglibourhood, and who, amid his useful and arduous professional 
duties, found time to give songs and sketches, written in the 
dialect, seldom equalled, never surpassed.
And finally, we have a peer of the realm, William Earl of 
Carlisle, for some time Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and representing 
the name and family of Belted Will.
His piece to a Jessamine 
Tree that flourished at his old Border castle at Naworth, exhibits 
such a striking contrast between the Border times and those that 
he himself represented, that I make no apology for quoting it in 
full.
( My slight and slender jessamine tree.
That bloomest on my Border tower, 
Thou art more dearly loved by me 
Than all the wreaths of foreign bower.
I ask not, while I near thee dwell, 
Arabia's spice or Syria's rose ; 
Thy light festoons more freshly smell, 
Thy virgin white more purely glows.
My wild and winsome jessamine tree, 
That climbest up the dark gray wall, 
Thy tiny flow'rets seem in glee.
Like silver spray-drops down to fall : 
Say, did they from their leaves thus peep, 
When mail'd moss-troopers rode the hill ; 
When helmed warders paced the keep, 
And bugles blew for Belted Will ?
My free and feathery jessamine tree, 
Within the fragrance of thy breath 
Yon dungeon grated to its key.
And the chain'd captive sigh'd for death.
On Border fray, on feudal crime, 
I dream not, while I gaze on thee ; 
The chieftains of that stem old time 
Could ne'er have loved a jessamine tree.
The first poet who wrote in the Cumberland dialect was Josiah 
Ralph, born soon after the year 1700.
It is best, when it is 
possible, to let one poet act as the historian and interpreter of 
149 
another, and I quote therefore the account which Robert Southey 
has given us of Relph : — "He was the son of a Cumberland 
statesman, who, on a paternal inheritance which could not much 
exceed, if it even amounted to, thirty pounds a year, brought up a 
family of three sons and a daughter, one of whom he educated for 
a learned profession.
Josiah was sent first to Appleby school, — 
one of the many excellent schools of this country, — then to 
Glasgow ; he afterwards engaged in a gramraar-shool in his native 
place, and succeeded to the perpetual curacy there ; but there is 
no reason to believe that his income was ever more than fifty 
pounds." 
" In a lonely dell," says Mr. Boucher, " by a murmuring stream, 
under the canopy of heaven, he had provided himself a table and 
a stool, and a little raised seat or altar of sods ; hither in all his 
difficulties and distresses, in imitation of his Saviour, he retired 
and prayed ; rising from his knees he generally committed to paper 
the meditation on which he had been employed, or the resolves 
he had then formed.
On business and emergencies which he 
deemed more momentous, he withdrew into the church, and there 
walking in the aisles, in that awful solitude, poured out his soul in 
prayer and praise to his Maker.
His sermons were usually medi- 
tated in the churchyard, after the evening had closed.
The awe 
which his footsteps excited at that unusual hour is not yet forgotten 
by the villagers." 
He continued his school when his constitution was visibly giving 
way to that disorder which at length proved fatal, being accelerated 
by his ascetic mode of living.
" A few days before his death he 
sent for all his pupils, one by one, into his chamber, — a more 
affecting interview it is not possible to conceive ; one of them, 
who is still living, acknowledges he never thinks of it without awe.
He was perfectly composed, collected, and serene.
His valedictory 
admonitions were not very long, but they were earnest and pathetic.
He addressed each one in terms somewhat different, adapted to 
their different tempers and circumstances ; but in one charge he 
was uniform, — lead a good life, that your death may be easy and 
150 
you everlastingly happy.
He died of consumption [in 1743] 
before he had completed his thirty-second year.
Many of Relph's pieces are pastorals and translations into the 
dialect from Horace, Virgil, and Theocritus.* And in some of his 
pieces he has very faithfully pourtrayed the chief characters of the 
village in which he lived.
Ewan Clark holds the place immediately succeeding Relph.
He 
was a writer of pastorals in the dialect.
His occupation was that of 
a teacher.
He was born in 1734, near the market-town of Wigton, 
and he died at the age of seventy-seven, at the same place.
His 
writings are of more value as representing the dialect, than for any 
original or poetic excellence they contain.
Coming in point of time soon after Relph, we have in Stagg a 
poet who differed from Relph almost as widely as possible.
Born 
about 1770, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle, he was by an accident 
deprived of his sight very early in life.
He kept a circulating 
library at Wigton, and eked out his existence partly by acting as 
fiddler at dances, hakes, fairs, and merry-nights.
Rough, ready, 
and outspoken, fancying there was no place on earth like Cumber- 
land, his writings and his outspoken rebuke of what he conceived 
to be wrong, frequently brought him into collision with other 
parties who were equally outspoken and equally quarrelsome ; this 
is marked in some of his poetical pieces where in his opening lines 
he expresses his willingness to make and sing songs for them, 
provided, as he earnestly entreats them, they will not thrash him for 
any disagreeable home truths that his songs may happen to contain.
He seems also to have been made the butt of some of the wags at 
the gatherings he attended, for Anderson, another Cumbrian poet, 
of whom I shall speak presently, says of him when he is describing 
the doings of a wedding at Worton — 
* Theocritus, the creator of Pastoral Poetry, wrote in a dialect (the Doric), 
and from his time to the present the pastoral poets seem to have very closely 
imitated each other.
In metre, in names, in subjects, Virgil has very closely 
imitated' — and almost at times translated — Theocritus ; and Virgil is the model 
from which all our modern pastoral poets have drawn.
151 
Blin' Stagg, the fiddler, gat a whack, 
The bacon-fleek fell on his back ; 
An' neist his fiddle-stick they brak, 
'Twas weel it was nea waur ; 
For he sang, VVhurry-whuin, whuddle-whum, 
Derry-eyden dee.
Bearing in mind that Stagg was doubtless sitting where the fiddler 
usually did sit in the chimney corner, and that the " bacon-fleek," 
of which some wag no doubt had cut the string, would fall upon 
his back from the rannal boak some height above him, it is very 
likely that Stagg would for that night, at any rate, sing no more 
about — 
Whurry-whum, whuddle-whum, 
Derry-eyden dee.
And yet in spite of "bacon-fleeks," in spite of poverty, in spite 
of blindness, he went on fiddling life away to a merry tune.
His 
songs bear evidence of good humour and contentment ; and, 
notwithstanding the rugged and at times somewhat coarse language 
in which they are expressed, exhibit trvithful pictures of Cumberland 
scenes, manners, and society, as they existed one hundred years 
ago.
His song, "The Bridewain," or bringing home of the bride, is 
perhaps the truest picture we possess of the keen neck-or-nothing 
galloping and other amusements which took place at a Cumbrian 
wedding.
It took place in the Abbey Holme, where it is known 
as the "Coat Wedding." While his "Rosley Hill Fair," which 
describes the doings at a noted Cumbrian fair something like 
Brough Hill Fair in Westmorland, is, from what I know myself, a 
faithful reflex of such like scenes.
Robert Anderson is the next Cumbrian poet.
He also was 
born shortly after 1770, in Carlisle, and died in 1833, at the same 
place.
He was a pattern drawer by trade.
His life was, like more 
lives, a hard struggle for existence; and he fell in his later years 
into habits of intemperance, which may possibly have had some- 
thing to do with those feelings of bitterness and misanthropy 
which he exhibited in the decline of his life.
As a poet in the 
152 
dialect he is undoubtedly at the head of the Cumbrian fraternity.
He carries us into their homes and domestic scenes, and lets us 
hear their quiet fireside chat.
He brings us to their fairs and 
merry-makings, their marriages, hakes, and dances.
He depicts 
their wrestlers and other athletes as the greatest heroes ; and, 
endowed with all their partialities and prejudices, he lets us know 
pretty plainly that he looks upon Cumberland as a county that 
holds very decidedly the very front rank.
His "Burgh Races" is a very truthful sketch of an athletic 
gathering that takes place at Burgh-by-San ds, near Carlisle, upon 
the succession of the Earls of Lonsdale.
His "Kit Craffet" 
sketches a character which for learning, for athletic prowess, and 
for virtue, was not, and is not yet, uncommon in the Cumbrian 
dales.
Dr. Gibson says of Anderson's " Worton Wedding," : — 
"As a description of a long, rapid, and varied succession of scenes, 
every one a photograph, occurring at a gathering of country people 
intent upon enjoying themselves in their own uncouth roystering 
fashion, given in rattling, jingling, regularly irregular rhyme, with 
a chorus that is of itself a concentration of uproarious fun and 
revelry, we have never read or heard anything like Anderson's 
' Worton Wedding.' "* 
In point of time Sanderson is the next Cumberland poet.
He withdrew himself in some measure from all society.
I 
have heard much of him, for I lived for some years in the 
same parish in which he lived and died.
His tragic fate, in 
the year 1829, has, however, been well told by Wordsworth.
I 
shall make no apology therefore for quoting it from Wordsworth's 
account.
It is as follows : — " Shirley's death reminded me of the 
sad close of the life of a literary person, Sanderson by name, in 
the neighbouring county of Cumberland.
He lived in a cottage 
by himself, which, from want of care on his part, took fire in the 
night.
The neighbours were alarmed ; they ran to the rescue ; he 
escaped dreadfully burned from the flames, and lay down (he was

in his seventieth year,) much exhausted under a tree, a few yards 
from the door.
His friends in the meantime endeavoured to save 
what they could of his property from the flames.
He inquired 
most anxiously after a box in which his manuscripts had been 
deposited with the view to the publication of a laboriously 
corrected edition ; and on being told that the box was consumed, 
he expired in a few minutes, saying, or rather sighing out the 
words, 'Then I do not wish to live!' Poor man!
though the 
circulation of his works had not extended beyond a circle of fifty 
miles in diameter perhaps at the farthest, he was most anxious to 
survive in the memory of those who should hear of him in his 
poems." His "Lay" dedicated to his native village, is the best of the 
works that have survived him.
I shall quote from it a passage in 
which he seems to regret — as old men often do regret — being left 
alone by the death of the friends and companions of his youth.
Speaking of them he says : — 
And blest are you in early graves, 
For age is but protracted pain — 
A longer strife with winds and waves.
Upon a wild and stormy main.
My lot has been to linger here 
Till every earthly joy has fled ; 
Till all is gone the heart holds dear.
And gather'd sorrows bow my head.
The lives of the Cumberland poets abound with contrasts ; 
and possibly there could not be a much greater contrast than 
is afforded between Sanderson and John Woodcock Graves, 
the author of "D'ye ken John Peel?" I do not pause to ask 
whether you ken John Peel or not — I take it for granted that you 
do ; for it has been spoken of as the Cumberland anthem, and is 
at any rate known and sung almost wherever hunters have made 
their way.
The author is not so well known.
He emigrated to 
Australia upwards of fifty years ago, and is, so far as I know, living 
still.
He has sent back the following sketch of himself: — "I was 
connected with the woollen mills at Caldbeck for some time, and 
these turned out a ruinous game.
I was cheated, robbed, and 
154 
gulled to such an extent, by those who ought to have been my 
best friends, that I resolved to go to the farthest corner of the 
earth.
I made a wreck of all ; left machinery, book-debts, etc., in 
the hands of a friend to provide for my two daughters whom I left 
behind; and landed at Hobart Town, in Tasmania, in 1833, with 
my wife and four children, and with about ten pounds in my pocket." 
He afterwards had the anxious wandering life of many settlers.
He is now a very old man, and from what has been heard of him 
lately, is in poor circumstances.
He gives the following sketch of the origin of the popular 
song: — "Nearly forty years have now wasted away since John 
Pefel and I sat in a snug parlour at Caldbeck, among the Cumbrian 
mountains.
We were then both in the hey-day of manhood, and 
hunters of the olden fashion ; meeting the night before to arrange 
earth-stopping ; and in the morning to take the best part of the 
hunt — the drag over the mountains in the mist — while fashionable 
hunters still lay in the blankets.
Large flakes of snow fell that 
evening.
We sat by the fireside hunting over again many a good 
run, and recalling the feats of each particular hound, or narrow 
neck-break 'scapes, when a flaxen-haired daughter of mine came 
in saying, 'Father, what do they say to what granny sings?' Granny 
was singing to sleep my eldest son — now a leading barrister in 
Hobart Town — with an old rant called 'Bonnie Annie.' The 
pen and ink for hunting appointments being on the table, the idea 
of writing a song to this old air forced itself upon me, and thus 
was produced impromptu, ' Dy'e ken John Peel, with his coat so 
gray?' Immediately after I sung it to poor Peel, who smiled 
through a stream of tears which fell down his manly cheeks ; and 
I well remember saying to him in a joking style, 'By Jove, Peel !
you'll be sung when we're both run to earth !' " 
John Rayson (1803 to 1859,) was during the best portion of 
his life a village schoolmaster, living on the whittlegate system.
" Charlie M'Glen," a sketch from life, is his best piece.
So far as I know, no sketch of the life of Dr. Gibson has hitherto 
appeared.
I have therefore devoted more space and attention to 
it than I have done to the other Cumberland poets of whom 
155 
biographies have appeared before.
I have lived for the last 
twenty-three years in the very same district in which Gibson lived 
and laboured, and whence he has drawn most of the materials 
for his writings.
His associations have therefore in a great measure 
been my associations, and I have thus had greater facility in dealing 
with his Hfe and writings than any mere stranger could have had.
I have however had an advantage even greater than this — I have 
had the most kind and cordial co-operation of Mr. Roger Bownass.
Dr. Gibson has himself borne willing testimony to the help he 
derived from Mr. Bownass in his writings, and I have certainly felt 
in the information which I have received from him on this subject, 
that no one could have a more accurate or a more trustworthy 
guide.
Alexander Craig Gibson was born at Harrington on March 
17th, 181 3.
His father was a ship-captain, and owned the vessels 
which he commanded, the last of which was driven on shore and 
wrecked during a storm while endeavouring to enter Workington 
harbour.
He lived many years after this, but never commanded 
another vessel, or looked up, as it were, afterwards, being 
supported, I believe, in a great measure by his son, the subject 
of this sketch.
His mother, from whom he obtained the name 
of Craig, came originally from Dumfriesshire, in the neigh- 
bourhood of Lockerbie.
He appears to have been in some 
measure brought up, and to have obtained part of liis early 
education, when staying with his mother's friends in this district.
It is a district with which I am myself very familiar, having lived 
in Annandale when a boy; and I remember that once when 
talking with him I remarked upon his intimacy with the persons 
and places there whom I had myself known there, he said that this 
was where some of his earliest associations and most lasting friend- 
ships had been formed.
This will account for the aptitude and 
ease with which in some of his compositions he uses the dialect of 
Dumfriesshire; and his intimate knowledge of persons, places, 
and traditions in that neighbourhood is all brought out in his 
poetical sketch, "The Lockerbie Lyke," which, commencing with 
an ordinary public-house brawl, leads on to a very fatal result.
156 
After leaving school he was apprenticed, as the custom then was, 
to a surgeon in Whitehaven, and having served the requisite time, 
he at first commenced practice as a surgeon and apothecary in 
that town ; but not meeting with the success he expected, he went 
to Lamplugh to reside, and practised for some time in a district 
that included Lamplugh, Ullock, Braithwaite, and Dean.
He 
came and commenced practice at Coniston in the year 1844, 
having been appointed medical officer to the Coniston Copper 
Mining Company.
Sometime after he came to Coniston he 
married a lady from that district of Cumberland from which he 
had come ; and they went to live at Yewdale Bridge, near the 
head of the Lake.
His practice took in the parish of Church 
Coniston, The Langdales, Torver, Seathwaite, and a portion of 
Hawkshead, comprising some of the loveliest and most sequestered 
districts of Lakeland.
This district seems to have exerted the 
greatest influence on his mind and character ; and the sketches he 
wrote after he left the neighbourhood, strongly evidence that he 
still retained his old enthusiasm for this lovely land.
His first 
production was entitled " Ravings and Ramblings about the Old 
Man of Coniston," It was a series of sketches chiefly of those 
districts to which his professional visits were made.
These 
sketches appeared originally in the Kendal Mercury^ but were 
afterwards collected and published by him in a separate volume.
It is a clever but at times somewhat eccentric production, formed 
— as he tells us in the preface to the earliest edition (now exceed- 
ingly scarce) — upon a suggestion contained in one of the essays of 
Professor Wilson.
He everywhere professes the greatest admiration 
for De Quincey as a writer, and he seems to me in this book in 
some measure to have imitated De Quincey's style.
These sketches 
are fraught with the closest and keenest observations of the scenery, 
the characters and customs of the people, the local celebrities, and 
the distinguished literati who had made this region their home.
He devotes a considerable portion of his book to a description of 
the romantic valley of the Duddon, and he at times hits out with 
considerable force at Wordsworth and the Wonderful Walker.
Wordsworth and Gibson looked at things under two very different 
157 
aspects.
Wordsworth saw everything at its best and brightest 
Gibson saw more of what was matter-of-fact and afforded scope for 
satire and amusement.
To Wordsworth, men and women usually 
appeared in their holiday garb, and upon their very best behaviour.
Gibson, visiting those districts professionally, doubtless saw more 
human nature en dishabille.
Any one may see this well brought 
out in his Folk-Speech of Cumberland, in a sketch in which he has 
placed, side by side, Wordsworth's description and his own descrip- 
tion of Betty Yewdale, who lived at Hackett, Little Langdale, 
and who is yet well remembered in the neighbourhood.
Under 
Gibson's treatment Betty and her husband are certainly more 
true to life.
I think, however, he has unduly detracted from the 
Wonderful Walker — a clergyman who upon a salary of five pounds 
a year laboured for considerably over half a century, first at Torver, 
then at Seathwaite, one of the remotest districts of this neighbour- 
hood, and who by his industry, frugality, and perseverance, 
combined with his untiring care for his flock, left a name and a 
memory which is not likely to be soon forgotten ; and whose 
example and influence have widened out very far beyond that 
remote valley in which he lived and died.
Wordsworth has made 
him one of the most prominent characters in " The Excursion," 
much of the scenery of which is laid in the valley of which Walker 
was pastor ; and in sneering at Wordsworth, Gibson neglects no 
opportunity of sneering at Walker as well.
The dawnings of Gibson's poetical powers are to be seen in 
Ravings and Ramblings, the original edition containing at least 
three of his poetical pieces, one of considerable length, "A Ride 
to Dungeon Gill on a Wet Day;" the other two being "An 
Address to the Old Man," and " Moonshine on the Lake." They 
are not written in the dialect, and they lack that force and terseness 
which are to be found in his more matured poetical productions.
With regard to his later pieces both in prose and poetry, he tells 
us himself that they were written more ior his ov/n amusement 
than for anything else, in the midst of the many calls of a busy 
professional life.
" Joe and the Geologist," and " T' Reets on't," 
mark perhaps more than any of his writings Gibson's mastery over 
158 
the words and idioms of the Cumbrian dialect, and his intimate 
knowledge of the Cumbrian character.
The geologist has been 
thought to represent Professor Sedgwick ; but Gibson himself tells 
us that he had no one in particular in view in writing this sketch ; 
but says that one day, when he was riding over Walna Scar into 
Torver, the idea crossed his mind as to what one of the farm lads 
of Torver or the neighbourhood would think about the labours of 
a geologist, and following out the train of thought he composed 
the sketch.
"Bobby Banks' Bodderment" has, I think, taken a 
greater hold upon the popular mind than anything he ever wrote.
The poetical portion of it is certainly a masterpiece, for with a 
very limited vocabulary — "Ten things an' yan, Bobby, ten things 
an' yan" — he manages to give us snatches of songs in almost every 
variety of Cumbrian measure, and in some measures that had never 
been attempted in that dialect before.
Bobby's explanation of 
how those snatches of song were made, seems to me to afford us 
a hint as to how Gibson's own songs were composed.
He says, 
" I didn't mack them, they mead theirsels." And the best songs 
are surely not those that are made by rule or measure, but which 
come unsought for, and, in Bobby's phraseology, "mack theirsels." 
This, however, was not always the case with Gibson's productions 
in the dialect, for he told me that he produced one of his dialect 
songs by composing it first and translating it into the Cumberland 
dialect afterwards.
This was "Breezy St. Bees;" and it is still to 
be found both as at first composed, and as he translated it into the 
dialect.
Of his songs, "Lai Dinah Grayson," or " M'appen I may," is 
much the most popular.
It has been set to a popular measure by 
Mr. Metcalfe, and is published by him in one of his series entitled 
Songs and Ballads of Cumberland, with Music.
His various pieces 
in the dialect were collected together and published in 1869, by 
Mr. Coward of Carlisle, in a volume entitled " The Folk-Speech 
of Cumberland and some Districts adjacent." It includes one or 
two poetical pieces in the dialect peculiar to Furness, and also one 
or two in the dialect of Lockerbie and the Scottish border.
A 
second edition appeared in 1872.
159 
Through the kindness of Mr. Coward I am enabled to give a 
critique upon this volume by Thomas Carlyle, in a letter which he 
sent to Dr. Gibson in 1869.
The opinion of Carlyle — born and brought up as he was at 
Ecclefechan, near Lockerbie — has a peculiar value upon anything 
relating to the'Border or the Cumbrian dialects.
Carlyle's letter to 
Gibson is as follows : — " I received your book on the Border 
Dialects ; and have read it over with a pleasant feeling of satisfac- 
tion of innocent entertainment and thanks for your gift.
A really 
nice little book ; indeed, I may fairly say, the best book I can 
remember to have ever read on such a subject.
Perfect under- 
standing and expression of the thing in hand, workmanlike 
treatment, variety, perspicuity, polite good humour, are nowhere 
wanting.
The bits of Cumberland song, especially, are of superior 
excellence ; truthful, graceful, free, flowing, very spirited and 
pretty, — considerable tmie in them and honest feeling of the thing 
sung.
On the whole it would not surprise me, if the writer of this 
book — should leisure, perseverance, and determined wish superadd 
themselves (which I fear they won't !) — were to come out someday, 
with something really good and useful in wider fields of literature.
Accept at any rate my Eiige for what you have already done." 
Dr. Gibson left Coniston in January, 185 1.
Before he left, the 
sum of twenty -five pounds was collected, in many instances as the 
unsolicited contributions of working-men, with which a gold watch 
with its appendages, and a gold pencil case, were purchased and 
presented to Dr. Gibson, by Mr. Roger Bowness, at a crowded 
and most enthusiastic meeting which was held for the purpose at 
the Black Bull inn* The watch bore the following inscription : — 
"Presented to Alexander Craig Gibson, Esq., by 190 friends in 
and near Conistone, including 90 of his poorest neighbours, in 
testimony of their gratitude for his services, respect for his character, 
and approbation of his conduct.
Jan. i, 185 1." It was accom- 
panied by an address, from which the following extract will serve 
* The reader may remember the Black Bull inn, at Coniston, as being the 
extreme point which De Quincey describes himself to have reached when 
making a pilgrimage to have an interview with Wordsworth, but where, struck 
with dread at the thought of VVordsworth's greatness, he turned back.
160 
to show the estimation in which Dr. Gibson was held.
"The 
period of your sojourn at Conistone has been characterized by so 
much usefulness in your professional capacity, and by such un- 
wearied attention towards your poorer patients — miners and others 
suffering from accidents or sickness — united too with so much 
kindness and courtesy to all, that we deeply feel the loss we sustain 
by your leaving us.
Be assured that you will bear with you our 
warmest wishes for your prosperity and happiness ; and we trust 
that the accompanying tokens, purchased with the spontaneous 
subscriptions of the great body of the inhabitants, many of them 
of the very poorest — will speak for us, and testify of our grateful 
esteem, and sometimes remind you of your sojourn amongst us." 
Dr. Gibson left Coniston for Hawkshead, where he resided and 
practised for between two and three years.
His practice at 
Hawkshead did not succeed as he had anticipated, and for a time 
he appears to have been uncertain where to go to.
After having 
thought of various schemes, he eventually fixed upon Bebington, 
in Cheshire, for practice, and there he spent the remainder of his 
life.
While there he still pursued his literary labours, and was 
honorary curator of the Lancashire and Cheshire Historical 
Society, to whose Transactions he contributed interesting papers 
upon antiquities and other subjects of local interest, " The Last 
Popular Risings in the Lake Country," being the title of one which 
I have read.
He seems while there to have been much respected 
by all classes.
In his latter years he became very infirm.
He 
died June 12th, 1874, and a monument of polished light Shap 
granite, eight feet high, was raised over his grave in Bebington 
churchyard.
It bears the following inscription : — "In Memory of 
Alexander Craig Gibson, M.R.C.S. and F.S.A., whose writings in 
the Cumberland dialect, whether in poetry or prose, are the most 
succcessful embodiments of the modes of thought and speech of his 
native county.
He was born at Harrington, 17th March, 1813, 
and died at Bebington, June 12th, 1874; where by his genial and 
benevolent nature, he gained a position as high in the regard of 
all classes, as his genius had won for him in his own department 
of literature." 
ISl 
Dr. Gibson was possessed of a very kind and genial disposition, 
and thus succeeded in securing the confidence of the dalesmen in 
a remarkable degree.
This was the means of obtaining from them 
that rich variety of local legend, story, and anecdote, with which 
his conversation abounded, and which gives such a charm to his 
works.
He was temperate; and in reference to this he once 
remarked to me that Miss Martineau had said in one of her 
writings that the doctors in the Lake Country are so often, in 
hospitality, asked to take drink, that they all do eventually take to 
drinking, if they live here long enough.
" What would she have 
said in your case?" I asked.
"That I had not lived here long 
enough," he replied.
In quest of health he became a great traveller.
He had been 
to Constantinople, done the round of the Mediterranean, and had 
also visited Norway and other regions that border on the Baltic 
Sea.
His writings, whether in prose or poetry, are a very thoughtful 
reflex of the Cumbrian dialect and the Cumbrian character ; and 
any one well acquainted with Cumberland will at once recognize 
that his sketches have been drawn from life.
His mode of dealing 
with writings and writers out of the range of the dialect, though 
perhaps at times too keen and sarcastic, is in other respects full of 
interest.
For years he certainly occupied the very first place as 
a writer in the dialect of Cumberland, and his death made a gap 
in the ranks of its literati which will not be easily filled.* 
The following sketch, chiefly of Dr. Gibson's later years, has 
been drawn up for me by the gentleman to whose kind and cordial 
CO operation I have alluded before : — "His Ravings and Ramblings 
round Coniston, through which he first became known as of literary 
tastes and capabilities hereabouts, and which has passed through 
three editions, were in the first place rapidly thrown off" at the 
* The rule that I laid down for myself— to deal as little as possible with 
works of any living writer, precludes me from writing a notice of Richardson of 
the Vale of St. John's.
Some future chronicler of the poets and prose writers 
of Cumberland will be able to show that he has as faithfully pourtrayed in prose 
and verse the dialect and doings of our county in our own times, as have any of 
our former poets in the era to which they belonged.

request of his friend the late Mr. Lee, editor and proprietor of the 
Kendal Mercury, in which they originally appeared some time after 
he first came to Coniston.
Each chapter was written off-hand, a 
day or two before publication, complete, and without need of but 
little correction — for he had a most facile pen, and the work of 
composition was no task to him, the matter being already fully 
stored, and arranged with all the necessary information in his mind 
as it should appear, so that the writing down what he wished to 
convey was a most easy one ; for he had a most retentive memory 
in those days, and anything told him, or read, that he wished to 
remember, was never forgotten.
" Blood-poisoning, it is said, accidentally contracted through a 
scratch while attending on a diseased patient, was the cause of his 
long illness ; and in later stages thereof, he was very far from being 
his former self, mentally as well as physically.
During the first 
stages of his illness he was advised to take a lengthened sea voyage, 
with the hope of deriving benefit therefrom ; and assisted, I believe, 
by friends and admirers in and about Liverpool, he accordingly 
took a passage up the Mediterranean in one of the Peninsular and 
Oriental steamers, accompanied I think by Mrs. Gibson, calling at 
Gibraltar, Malta, Beyrout, and other places on the Syrian coast, 
returning by Constantinople and Greece — without deriving the 
the anticipated benefit.
" At different stages of his voyage, he sent home to his friend 
'Shimonius,' of the Liverpool Porcupine, letters for publication 
therein, describing places they touched at and incidents that 
occurred on board, etc., which appeared in that paper, and were 
read with much interest.
But before the end of the voyage, 
through failing health and strength, he was obliged to discontinue 
these.
" During his illness, and while staying at Coniston for the benefit 
of his enfeebled health, he was laid hold of by a swindling concern 
of a bogus mining company, and induced by the scheming pro- 
moters and agent thereof, to lend his well-known name, as a decoy 
to others no doubt, and to become a subscriber to a scheme for 
re-opening a much bepuffed, worthless old copper mine in the 
163 
neighbourhood, which had already had three or four crops of 
unhappy dupes.
The miserable thing again soon collapsed — not, 
however, before getting hold of what plunder they could lay hands 
on, as hundreds of such bogus companies, promoted in the 
interests of swindledom, continue still to do — yet not before many 
innocent, unsuspecting ones, were 'taken in and done for," among 
whom was Dr. Gibson, to a considerable amount in his way, viz., 
the savings of a considerable period of his later years.
This no 
doubt was pain and grief to him, and a source of much chagrin, 
embittering his declining days ; not so much from the pecuniary 
loss to himself alone — though he could ill spare it — as from 
thinking how he had been duped ; and others too, through his 
example in some degree, had been victimized also, who otherwise 
might not have been.
" The following affecting and affectionate letter — affectionate in 
its loving memory of him — in reply to a word of sympathy, was 
received from his widow, by an old friend in Coniston, not long 
after his death, telling somewhat of his long suffering and un- 
complaining patience under it, may perhaps not be considered out 
of place here : — 
"Bebington, July 9th, 1874.
" Dear Mr. B , 
' ' Your sympathy is truly kind.
My loss is very great.
Sometimes I 
scarcely know how to bear the great loneliness.
He has been so long my 
companion and my care, which makes me miss him more now.
" He was so patient and so cheerful all through his long illness, and never 
murmured.
His death has left a sad blank in my life, but I would not recall 
him now, for life was becoming to him weariness.
" He always retained for you a warm friendship, and never forgot your 
kindness.
• • • 
' ' Believe me, ever your very faithfiil friend, 
"S.
CRAIG GIBSON." 
Miss Powley is amongst the last of our Cumbrian poets, and of 
her the following graphic account appeared about the time of her 
death : — 
"We record with deep regret, at Langwathby, on Saturday, 
December 23rd, 1883, the death of Miss Mary Powley, whose 
164 
name as one of our local literary celebrities has been frequently 
before the public for many years.
Her poems, long known and 
admired by her friends, gained a wider circulation when about 
eight years ago she committed a selection of them to the press, 
under the name of Echoes of Old Cumberland, a name singularly 
appropriate, for her object in life seemed to be to preserve every 
record that she could remember or collect from friends, of old 
Cumberland life.
• • • Who would have thought that the 
subjects were written by one who for many years could scarcely 
grasp the pen when it was carefully placed between her fingers.
Brought downstairs each morning when the weather was sufficiently 
fine, motionless all day and carried up again at night, her brain 
was ever swift to conceive, though the hand was slow to execute.
And so she passed the time for many years, patiently waiting for 
the end.
And it came suddenly; for whilst inspecting the Christmas 
cards which had been sent by troops of friends, she exclaimed 
that she felt a peculiar sensation in her throat, and in half-an-hour 
she passed away." 
To this sketch we may add that her best pieces probably are, a 
description of Brough Hill, a noted fair in Westmorland, which 
may be compared with Stagg's " Rosley Hill," a fair which at one 
time had a similar renown in Cumberland.
Her poem upon Relph 
is an excellent pourtrayal of the quiet, retiring, and student-like 
character of the first Cumbrian poet.
"A Tale of late October," 
describes a Border raid ; while her "Brokken Statesman," in the 
dialect, describes well the fallen fortunes of one of the Cumberland 
yeomen — a race of independent landowners who used to be more 
characteristic of the county than perhaps any other class.
She read Danish well ; attracted to it, doubtless, by its very 
close affinity with our own Cumbrian dialect.
And anything 
connected with the county— its history, literature, local place- 
names, or archseology, found her at all times ready to enter heart 
and hand into its work.
I may be asked, What is the advantage of thus trying to elucidate 
the writings and the dialect of the poets of Cumberland and Lake- 
land ?
and this question in conclusion I shall endeavour to meet.
165 
My idea at first as to call my address — The Songs and Singers 
of Cumberland* and Lakeland, because the productions of the 
poets of whom I have been speaking seldom get beyond the 
compass of what we understand by a Imllad or a song ; though if 
you take the word song in its fullest acceptation, it is difficult to 
limit the kind of poetry to which it may be applied : David was 
the sweet singer of Israel, and Carlyle calls the stupendous work 
of Dante a song.
It is maintained now by many, that the immortal work of 
Homer consisted originally of songs or rhapsodies in which the 
history and the manners of the earlier Grecians were sung by the 
wandering minstrels at their festive assemblies.
Such songs seem to have formed the method by which the 
traditionary history of the earlier Romans, in all their rustic austerity 
and simplicity, was handed down to the knowledge of the later 
historians.
These are the songs which Macaulay has so success- 
fully attempted to imitate in his Lays of Ancient Rome, and 
possibly there was no more effective way of handing down the 
history and the memory of their ancestors than when — 
With weeping and with laughter 
Still is the story told, 
How well Horatius kept the bridge 
In the brave days of old.
It is somewhat in the same way — to compare great things with 
small — that we find the chief value for the songs and singers of 
our native land.
They spoke a language which, though fast dying out, still retains 
its hold in many of our sequestered valleys.
They give truthful 
glimpses of the manners and customs of our forefathers ; and some 
of the most enduring sketches of the history of our country are 
preserved — when they are preserved at all — in the rhyme and 
rhythm of their well-remembered lines.
For retaining a vivid remembrance of events ; for handing down 
* " The Songs and Singers of Cumberland'" was the title which I gave to 
this paper when, with some omissions, I read it at the Mechanics' Institute at 
Coniston on October 30th (under the presidency of Dr. Kendall), as the first of 
the Coniston series of lectures for the winter of 18S4-85.
16(; 
the memory of manners and customs : for uniting mankind in one 
common bond of brotherhood ; for awakening in him pure and 
hallowing remembrances of home and friends ; and, I will also add, 
for educating him in all that is virtuous and good and noble, there 
is no more powerful agency than song.
I am not now speaking of all songs : the place of light may be 
assumed by darkness, and evil may usurp the character of good ; 
and I know that all that is lewd, licentious, and demoralizing has 
at times been garbed in the measure of a song.
But, as a rule, our own countrymen do not labour under that 
imputation.
I have told you how Relph, the first Cumbrian poet, 
died.
He died with his pupils around him, exhorting them to 
remember his teachings, and to devote their lives to that which 
was honourable, and dutiful, and good.
And his poetry, beside 
being the reflex of the dialect and manners of those amongst whom 
he lived, is also a reflex of purity and simplicity.
The same thing 
may be said of Sanderson, of Wilkinson the Yanwath poet of 
Westmorland, and others; and they have thus as it were embalmed 
the customs and the dialect of their native counties, and given 
home words and home memories to our hills and valleys, which 
may serve as a name and a memory to those that come behind.
I do not claim for them any high place of poetic excellence — for 
the quiet and unobtrusive manner in which they placed their 
writings before the public, when they did place them before the 
public at all, shows it was the very last claim they themselves would 
have thought of making.
Their writings seem in many instances 
to be but the natural outcome of their position and circumstances.
The quiet teacher and student relieving his studies by translating 
into his native dialect the songs of Horace, or the pastorals of his 
favourite Virgil and Theocritus.
The blind fiddler describing in 
the dialect the scenes of uproarious merriment to which he himself 
had given the key-note.
The keen huntsman at the close of a 
hard day's hunting, taking the pen he was using for hunting 
appointments, and dashing off, "D'ye ken John Peel?" till John 
Peel is known from the hills of Cumberland to the woods of Tas- 
mania.
167 
These are our poets, and these are their subjects.
They serve 
to give us a bond of brotherhood one to another, and to bind us 
with still stronger ties to our hills and valleys, to our native 
customs and dialects, and to the remembrances of the friends and 
the scenery amid which our lives are cast ; and they seem to say 
to us in the words of one of them (Anderson) with which I may 
well conclude this paper : — 
We help yen anudder — we welcome the stranger.
Ourselves and our country we'll iwer defend ; 
We pay bits o' taxes as weel as we're yebble.
And pray, leyke true Britons, the war hed an end.
Then Cummerlan' lads, an' ye lish rwosy lasses.
If some caw ye clownish, ye needn't think shem ; 
Be merry and wise, enjoy innocent pleasures.
And still seek for peace and contentment at yem.

NOTES ON THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION AND 
FOSSILS OF THE SILLOTH NEW DOCK.
By J.
LEITCH, M.B., CM.
(Rtad at Silloth.
) 
The excavations for the above undertaking being almost finished, 
a complete account of the formations that were passed through, 
and of the organic remains that were met with, may now (November 
1884) be given.
Some of the latter have already become historical, and indeed 
nothing of interest has been found for more than a year.
But, in 
order that a perfect list might be made, and in the hope that, up 
to the last, some fresh treasure might be found, I have deferred 
writing these notes until now.
The paper may be divided into two parts : — 
I St. The Geological Formation.
2nd.
The Organic Remains.
1st.
Geological Formation.
— The average depth of the dock, 
from the original surface to the floor, is thirty feet; and, as no 
rocky strata were met with, the work of excavation proceeded 
rapidly.
At the entrance, however, where the foundations of the 
most important structures are laid, a depth of over forty feet had 
to be reached ; but for those of the side walls, a depth of several 
feet less sufficed.
170 
From the surface downwards, the following formations were 
passed through : — 
(a) Blown Sand.
(/^) Alternating layers of Sand and Gravel.
(c) A main bed of Gravel.
(d) Boulder Clay.
(a) The Blown Sand — which, it may be mentioned, is the 
surface formation for many miles along the coast, and which forms 
ranges of dunes running from east to west — averaged about eight 
feet in depth.
But it ought to be observed that, when the old 
dock was made, and when the lines of railway leading to it, 
and which until lately ran over the site of the new dock, were laid 
down, several dunes, twenty to thirty feet in height, had to be 
removed.
{l>) The alternating layers of Sand and Gravel averaged 
respectively about twenty inches in thickness, and together 
occupied a depth of from eight to ten feet.
In this formation 
a shell-beach was met with, which extended across the dock, with 
an average thickness of two feet.
The shells were, for the most 
part, entire ; and they belonged to species at present existing in 
British waters.
Oyster, Mussle, Cockle, Whelk, Limpet, and 
Scallop shells were found in great abundance.
The beach was 
first met with about eleven feet from the surface.
(c) The bed of Gravel was about ten feet thick throughout the 
area of the dock.
It was of enormous value to the contractors, 
for, with the addition of a seventh part of cement, and of a 
sufficiency of water, it made the concrete with which the dock 
walls were built.
(d) Immediately under the gravel came the Clay, in which the 
foundations are all laid.
It greatest thickness, so far as is known, 
is thirty feet ; five to fifteen feet of which had to be passed through 
to form the floor of the dock.
The clay, which is red and sandy, 
contained a considerable variety of far-travelled boulders, including 
many of Criffel Granite.
These were met with chiefly at the north 
end of the dock ; and, at the entrance, they formed a troublesome 
171 
obstacle to the driving of the piles.
The boulders had a rounded 
contour; and they averaged half a ton in weight.
On one or two, 
indistinct scratchings were seen.
They were found in the lower 
levels, while smaller blocks, which included, amongst other far- 
travelled stones, some from Ennerdale, were found in the higher 
parts of the deposit.
At the N.W. corner, the clay, which there 
seemed to be rapidly thinning out, was found to overlie two feet 
of soft sand, and (so far as examined) two feet of marl.
While at 
a spot about half way along the west side, three feet of black 
laminated clay, nine inches of a very hard red sandy clay with 
shingles, and lastly, sand and gravel underlay the clay.
The greatest depth explored was forty-five feet, and at this 
horizon the rock met with consisted of sand and gravel.
2Jid. Organic Remains.
— The shell-beach has been already 
noticed.
The first mammalian relic that was found, was an 
antler of the Red-deer ( Cervus elaphus).
It possessed five tines, 
measured twenty-six inches in length, and was fairly well preserved.
It, like the other mammalian relics, was met with at the east side 
of the dock, about fifty yards from the east wall, and the same 
distance from that on the south.
The antler was found in gravel, 
about seventeen feet from the surface.
About the same place, 
and about a foot deeper, the first trace of the Bos primigenius — 
the extinct gigantic Ox of Great Britain — was dug up.
This fossil 
was a humerus or upper bone of the fore-leg.
It weighed five 
pounds twelve ounces, was eighteen inches long, and was almost 
perfect, only a part of the articular surface of the head being 
decayed and filled with sand.
The proportions of this bone 
were very massive, and they indicated, in a striking manner, the 
colossal size of the huge animal it had assisted in supporting.
Some yards distant, another antler of the Red-deer was found.
It was a much finer specimen than the first, the tines being seven 
in number, and quite perfect.
Several months elapsed before anything further was discovered ; 
but when a depth of about twenty-eight feet was reached, several 
finds were made in close succession.
The first of these was one 
of the caudal vertebra of a species of Balanoptera or Fin-whale.
172 
It weighed four pounds, was in perfect preservation, and showed 
the concentric ridges for the attachment of the intervertebral 
cartilages, in a well-marked manner.
Professor Turner, of Edinburgh University, to whom I am 
indebted for the identification of the Fossils, considers this bone 
to have belonged to a species of Balcenoptera still existing.
Close 
to this fossil was found the most interesting of all the relics — a 
portion of the skull of the Bos primigenms, with both horn-cores 
in situ.
The greater part of the skull was absent, but the cores 
were perfect.
The weight was 22 lbs.
The length of core along posterior curve - 26^ in.
Do. do.
anterior do.
- 21 „ 
Distance between tips of cores - - - 27 „ 
Breadth of forehead between cores - - 10 „ 
Circumference of core at root - - - 1 2| „ 
The discovery of this fossil at once settled any doubts as to the 
origin of the humerus.
Curiously enough, just at this time, while 
excavations for a gas reservoir were going on, some five hundred 
yards further inland, another skull of the Bos primigenius, with 
horns attached, was dug up.
This was not so good a specimen 
as the last, the horn-cores being much decayed.
It was found 
about ten feet from the surface, lying in sand, over a bed of grey 
marl, which is, probably, of lacustrine origin.
It thus differed 
from the dock specimen, which was found in the gravel over the 
boulder-clay.
There was next found another caudal vertebra of Balcenoptera, 
much smaller than the first, and probably belonging to a part near 
the extremity of the tail.
Other bones of the Bos primigenius were 
discovered soon afterwards, viz : — 
(i) A Tibia, weighing three pounds fourteen ounces, and

the articular surfaces of the head, and twelve inches in circum-

It lay in the gravel horizontally.
The wood about 
the centre was spongy and wet ; but the outer portions were sound

The interesting question as to how these bones came into the 
positions in which they were found, cannot of course be answered 
with certamty.
But, as we may see on our own shores, it would 
seem highly probable that, during the dissolution of some stranded 
carcase, the bones became separated one by one, and, carried by 
the tides a greater or less distance, were finally washed up on this 
174 
prehistoric beach, which to-day Has buried sixteen feet below high 
water level, and is four hundred and fifty yards further inland than 
where the spring tides of the Solway now reach.

CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A LIST 
OF THE MINERALS OCCURRING IN CUMBERLAND 
AND WESTMORLAND.
(Concluding Part.) 
By J.
G. GOODCHILD, F.G.S., F.Z.S., H.M. Geol.
Survey.
(Read at the Penrith Annual Meeting.) 
Following the arrangement adopted in the parts of the List 
already published, the section of minerals that next comes under 
notice begins with the important group of rock-constituents known 
as the Silicates.
These are primarily grouped in two series — the 
Anhydrous, and the Hydrous Silicates.
Each of these again is 
subdivided in accordance with the ratio between the Oxygen and 
the base combined with it.
These subdivisions are further classed 
according to their respective crystallographic characters.
Taking the group wherein the ratio of the Silica to the base is 
as 2:1, and the crystallization is in forms belonging to the Rhombic 
system, the first mineral we have to refer to is Hypersthene 
(MgO, FeO) SiOz. The existence of this particular species any- 
where within the district herein specially referred to has been 
much questioned of late by competent authorities.
The principal 
locality where it is considered by many persons to occur, is at 
Carrick Fell, where, if it has been correctly identified, it forms an 
important constituent of the beautiful rock composing a large part 
of that mountain.
This rock, all are agreed, is rock of igneous 
origin — many regard it as a highly-metamorphosed series of old 
lava flows — and it now consists of a coarsely-crystalline aggregation 
176 
of one or more species of plagioclase felspar, with a large proportion 
of the particular mineral under notice.
The minerals mentioned 
are accompanied by much serpentinous matter and by kaolin ; 
both due to causes affecting the rock since its exposure at the 
surface.
Other minerals associated are, as my colleague Mr.
Rudler has informed me, Hornblende in considerable quantity; 
one or more undetermined species of the Pyroxenic group, Biotite, 
and Apatite.
Quartz is also found occasionally.
The mineral 
usually referred to Hypersthene is generally of a very dark bronze 
colour on the unweathered parts, and it exhibits well-marked 
cleavage-faces, which are silky, or sub-metallic in lustre, and often 
of much the same appearance as the alloy known as pinchbeck.
Some say that the mineral that has been called Hypersthene 
at Carrick should by right have been named Diallage ; but the 
question seems never to have been definitely settled as yet ; 
perhaps because the mineral itself, on account of its very great 
geological antiquity (it is certainly of pre-carboniferous age), has 
undergone such changes as render its correct identification a 
matter of difficulty.
Owing to the fact that the felspar matrix of the Carrick Fell 
rock weathers away faster than its associated minerals, large 
crystals, frequently of an inch or more in length, of the mineral 
now under notice, are left projecting as rough crystals with a 
tea-green exterior on the exposed portion of the rock.
It may be 
collected in almost any quantity from the fallen rock-matter 
accumulated on the eastern- and the south-eastern slopes of 
Carrick Fell.
There is at present some doubt also in regard to whether the 
next species, Enstatite, occurs as a constituent of the rocks of 
Cumberland and Westmorland or not.
There is every reason to 
expect to meet with it as one of the constituents of our crystalline 
rocks.
AuGiTE, a mineral allied in composition to the two last-mentioned, 
but crystallizing in forms belonging to the Monoclinic, instead of 
to the Rhombic system, occurs as an important constituent in 
many of the eruptive (i.e. plutonic and volcanic) rocks of Cumber- 
177 
land and Westmorland.
So far as our present knowledge goes, 
Augite does not occur as a product of metamorphism here, though 
it is known to do so in other parts.
Augite occurs in scattered 
crystals, usually of small size, in the lavas of the Borradale volcanic 
series — a fact of considerable interest and importance, if only as 
proving that volcanic action at one of the remotest-known periods 
of the earth's history was essentially the same in character as can 
be actually seen in active volcanoes at the present day.
Augite 
occurs in the two counties also as a rock-constituent of some of 
the plutonic rocks of later date than the Silurian series.
It is 
found again in rocks known to be contemporaneous with the older 
part of the Carboniferous rocks ; as along the Border near Bew 
castle.
In the well-known Whin Sill again, which is a post- 
carboniferous rock, it occurs as a representative of a period later 
still ; while in the Armathwaite Dyke, the Augite constituent 
occurs in one of the latest manifestations of plutonic action within 
our district.
This dyke is probably of Miocene age, as Dr. Geikie 
has shewn is the case with some Scottish dykes occurring in the 
same manner.
DiALLAGE is another mineral closely allied in chemical composi- 
te the three minerals just enumerated.
It crystallizes in nearly 
the same form as Augite ; but differs from that mineral in displaying 
very perfect cleavage along planes parallel to one of the crystalline 
faces.
Some of this mineral shews cleavage faces with a sub- 
metallic lustre, something like Hypersthene.
It is, like Augite, 
exclusively confined to eruptive rocks, at least in Cumberland and 
Westmorland ; but it is of much less common occurrence than 
Augite ; and, so far as is at present known, it does not occur here 
in any rocks of later date than those of the Older Palaeozoic series.
Well-developed crystals occur in the beautiful rock known as 
Gabbro, that occurs as an intrusive sheet in the metamorphosed 
Skidda Slates at Cuns* Fell, near Ousby, as well as in the similar 
rock forming Wallat Crag, Hawes Water.
In both of these the

"Wallow," which is sometimes used, is probably as little warranted by the 
meaning of the word as it is by its local pronunciation.
]3 
178 
mineral under notice occurs in crystals ranging up to about a 
quarter of an inch in length.
These crystals exhibit well-defined 
faces of cleavage, which have a somewhat horny-looking texture, 
and a sub-metallic lustre.
In each case the Diallage is associated 
with Oligoclase Felspar, and with more or less titaniferous iron.
Hornblende, again, belongs to the same raineralogical group 
as the species already enumerated ; but it differs from any of them 
in its crystalline form, as well as in its angles of cleavage, and, to 
some extent, also in its chemical composition.
Hornblende in 
Cumberland and Westmorland occurs almost exclusively as an 
original constituent of the eruptive rocks of Older Paleozoic age ; 
and it is found rarely or not at all as a product of metamorphism.
It forms an important constituent in the crystalline rocks of the 
Buttermere and Ennerdale " Syenite " or Hornblendic Granite, 
and of the Diorite of Carrick Fell, as well as of several other 
crystalline eruptive rocks occurring in the two counties.
The 
more important of these will be found described in detail in Mr.
Ward's various papers on the Petrology of Cumberland and West- 
morland.* 
Crystals of Hornblende rarely attain to any considerable dimen- 
sions in the area under notice ; and indeed it has not been possible 
to prove the existence of this mineral at all in the case of many 
varieties of rocks, except by means of an examination of thin slices 
of rock with the aid of the microscope.
Detailed descriptions of 
these observations will eventually appear in the official publications 
of the Geological Survey ; where the subject will be treated in a 
fuller manner than is possible here.
AcTiNOLiTE, one of the fibrous sub-species of Hornblende, 
occurs in a few locahties; generally in association with one or 
other of the Older Palseozoic eruptive rocks.
Near Melmerby it 
is found in the form of narrow veins traversing an altered and 
much-decomposed intrusive mass of "greenstone" — using that 
term in its old, and very convenient, generic sense, as meaning a 
crystalline eruptive rock containing one or other species of either 
the Augite or the Hornblende group.
The Actinolite at Melmerby 
* A list of tliese is given in Number VII.
of our Transactions.
179 
is in the form of close-set fibrous masses of horny-looking, tea-green 
crystals, which extend across the veins from one side to the other.
In many cases they appear to be of very little later date than the 
bed wherein they occur ; and they probably represent the date of 
the contraction of the rock consequent upon its passing into the 
solid state.
Olivine, the Di-magnesian (ferrous, etc.) Silicate, a mineral that 
forms an important constituent of many modern rocks of volcanic 
origin, is rare, or, at the most, represented only by pseudomorphs 
in most of the Older Palaeozoic rocks of the Lake District.
In 
some eruptive rocks of Post-Carboniferous age in North Cumber- 
land it has lately been detected in small quantities.
Amongst the Hydrated Monosilicates is Serpentine, which 
as a separate mineral, can hardly be claimed as a local species ; 
though compounds of much the same general nature occur as 
decomposition-products of parts of eruptive rocks throughout 
nearly the whole of the Older Palaeozoic rocks of the district.
Talc, the Hydrous Magnesian monosilicate, is stated by Bryce 
M. Wright {op.
cit.
p. Ixxx.) to occur "associated with haematite, 
near Egremont." As a decomposition-product it occurs under the 
same conditions as the mineral last-enumerated.
Hemimorphite, Smithsonite, the Hydrous Zinc monosilicate 
has been obtained from two localties in the district.
At one, 
Alston, it occurs in the form of light-grey to white, encrusting 
groups of minute acicular crystals, coating blende and other 
minerals, in connection with the fault-breccia of mineral veins.
The other, and better-known locality for the mineral, is Rowtin 
Gill, in the Caldbeck Fells.
Here it occurs in the form of en- 
crusting sheets composed of small acicular crystals set side by side.
These sheets of crystals are disposed layer over layer, to a thickness 
of sometimes as much as an inch or more.
The outer surface is 
usually smooth ; but occasionally the outer ends of the separate 
crystals project so far as to form a surface more or less rough.
Masses have been found extending over a surface of nearly a 
square foot in area.
Here too, as at Alston, this silicate is inti- 
mately associated with fault-breccia in the mineral veins of the 
180 
district.
There can be little doubt, from its mode of occurrence 
in each case, that this mineral represents a secondary product 
resulting from the decomposition of other ores of zinc, and the 
rearrangement of the material in another compound.
The Rowtin 
Gill specimens are generally of a most beautiful blue tint, due, it 
is said, to the presence of blue carbonate of copper.
It is the 
presence of this mineral that has earned for the Rowtin Gill variety 
of Hemimorphite the name of Cupreous Silicate of Zinc.
Chrysocolla, the amorphous form of Hydrous Copper monosili- 
cate, is another mineral occurring in the Caldbeck Fells.
Like the 
mineral last-named it occurs exclusively in connection with the fault- 
breccia, or rider, of the mineral veins ; and it is also in like manner 
probably a secondary product resulting from the decomposi';i"n of 
other ores.
The Caldbeck Fell Chrysocolla usually occurs in the 
form of resinous, or sub-vitreous, masses filling the interstices in 
the vein-stuff, but sometimes it occurs in the form of small 
encrusting spheroids grouped together on the faces of the vein 
stuff in such a manner as to remind one of cauliflower heads rather 
than of anything else.
The mineral varies in colour from a clear 
whitish green to a beautiful turquoise.
Chrysocolla occurs at 
several other localities than Rowtin Gill.
I have seen it at the 
old mines in the Glenderattera; and Mr. Bryce M.
Wright mentions 
Newlands, besides one or two other localities in the neighbourhood 
of Carrick.
Another series of silicates is formed by the species wherein 
monoxides and sesquioxides are associated in the same mineral.
The first of these in our list is Idocrase, or Vesuvianite.
It is 
a fact of some interest that, although Idocrase is one of the best 
known minerals formed in connection with the products of modern 
volcanoes, yet the whole of the enormous accumulation of volcanic 
material that forms our Lake District mountains has, so far, not 
yielded even a trace of this mineral in the form of an original 
constituent of the rock.
In the only locality where its existence 
has yet been made known, Wastdale Head, near the Shap Granite 
Quarries, it occurs, it is true, in a group of rocks that are partly of 
181 
volcanic origin; but there can be not a shadow of a doubt, judging 
from its mode of occurrence, that the existence of the mineral in 
that instance is due simply to the action of metamorphism.
The 
rock where the Idocrase occurs belongs to the upper or newer 
group of volcanic rocks of the Lake District, associated with the 
Coniston Limestone as contemporaneous members of the series.
These, like the much-more-fuliy-developed series exposed on the 
same geological horizon on the south west flanks of Roman Fell,* 
which I have proved to be of Bala age, are altogether distinct 
from the Borradale Rocks proper.
The occurrence of the mineral 
in Westmorland was first made known by Professor Harkness, 
whose large series of specimens illustrating its mode of occurrence, 
now, together with most of his minerals, forms part of the 
increasingly-valuable collection in the Carlisle Museum.
Idocrase 
occurs elsewhere in the British Isles as a product ef metamorphism; 
and it is interesting to note that at least in same of the cases, the 
rock metamorphosed has been, as at Wastdale Head, more or less 
calcareous.
The variety of Andalusite known as Chiastolite is a rock- 
constituent of considerable importance in Cumberland.
It occurs 
exclusively as a product of metamorphism, resulting from the 
alteration of the sedimentary beds of the Skidda Slate around 
the granitic intrusions of the Cawda area.
Mr. Ward has given 
us detailed descriptions of the changes of lithological character 
observable as the unaltered Skidda Slates are traced in the direction 
of the granite.
One of the manifestations of the regional meta- 
morphism affecting that area is the sealing-up of the cleavage that 
elsewhere affects these rocks.t Just outside the zone where this 
phenomenon is observable, the crystals of Chiastolite attain their 
fullest development.
Within this zone, (in other words, nearer to 
the granite,) the crystals of Chiastolite by degrees give place to 
Mica, and the rock then passes from Chiastolite Slate into a kind 
of Mica schist.
It is noteworthy in this case that, in the stage of 
* See the collection of specimens in the Rock Collection of the Museum of 
Practical Geology, where these rocks have been publicly exhibited and labelled 
" Bala Volcanic Series" since the early part of 1881.
t This fact does not appear to have been previously noticed.
182 
alteration marked by the presence of the mineral under notice, 
there is, seemingly, little or no tendency on the part of the Chias- 
tolite to develop more along the planes of cleavage or of bedding 
than elsewhere ; while in the ultimate stage, where Mica takes the 
place of the Chiastolite, the Mica appears to me to follow the original 
bedding-planes of the rock.
In other words, the Foliation of the 
rocks appears to me to be coincident with the Bedding.
The 
subject is well worth further investigation.
Even with all the 
information that Sedgwick, Otley, Phillips, Harkness, Ward, and 
others have published respecting the development of Chiastolite 
Slate, there remains much that does not seem to be quite satis- 
factorily explained.
Two or more species or sub-species of the Garnet group occur 
as metamorphic products at several localities in Cumberland and 
Westmorland.
A few small Garnets may be detected here and 
there in the Carboniferous shales where these are much altered by 
contact-metamorphism, as where the Whin Sill is very fully- 
developed.
But the fullest development of Garnets occurs in 
many of the more highly-altered Older Palaeozoic tuffs of the Lake 
District.
They occur in great numbers in some particular beds of 
tuff, especially in the neighbourhood of large intrusions of Plutonic 
rocks.
Mr. Ward mentions a bed of tuff near Great Gable, as an 
instance ; another locality is one of the crags on the east side of 
the foot of UUswater.
Bryce M.
Wright {pp.
cit.) mentions Walla 
Crag [Hawes Water] as well as several localities near Keswick.
At some of these the crystals may be detached from the rock- 
matrix with little difficulty ; and the Garnets are frequently 
sufficiently clear and free from flaws to be available for ornamental 
purposes.
As in the case of the mineral last-mentioned, the 
genesis of our Garnets yet remains to be satisfactorily worked out.
Epidote occurs here and there in groups of small acicular 
crystals, usually of some shade of dark yellowish-green, or of 
olive, and forming small nests, or lining fissures, in the volcanic 
rocks of the Lake District ; especially in such rock as shew evident 
signs of having undergone a certain amount of metamorphism.
Several veins of it occur in the Volcanic rocks near Keswick.
In 
183 
smaller quantities it is met with also in the highly-altered tuffs of 
Bala age that form the deep rock-cutting on the London and 
North Western Railway at Shap summit.
As disseminated crystals 
of small size it seems to be pretty generally diffused through most 
of the Older Palseozoic eruptive rocks of Cumberland and West- 
morland.
It has not, so far as I am at present aware, yet been 
found in our district in connection with any other rocks than those 
specified.
The important group of the Felspars falls next to be noticed.
To describe the mode of occurrence and the locality of each 
species would require many pages of description; and, seeing 
that the subject can be treated in a manner adequate to its im- 
portance only in such publications as the Memoirs of the Geological 
Survey, I shall confine my remarks on the present occasion to little 
more than a mere list of the species observed.
As native products, 
that is to say, as minerals that have originated in the rocks where 
they occur, as distinguished from such as have been derived from 
pre-existing crystalline rocks, all the Felspars we have belong to 
to one or other of the eruptive rocks.
They have either been 
brought into their present position as crystals when the rocks that 
contain them were in process of formation, or else owe their 
existence to a rearrangement of constituents already in the rocks, 
which rearrangement has been brought about through the agency 
of the causes comprised under the general term metamorphism.
Under the first, may be included the crystals of Felspar floated to 
the surface in the old lava flows, or that, in association with other 
mineral matter, have been intruded amongst prior-formed rocks in 
the form of dykes.
The fine series of porphyrite lavas of Bala age 
at Rake Brow, Melmerby ; (which have been well represented by 
specimens publicly exhibited in the Geological Survey Rock 
Collection since 1881 ;) or, again, the equivalent rocks of Berrier 
Nittles, near Greystoke, well exemplify the mode of occurrence of 
Felspar crystals in lavas.
The relation of the same minerals to 
granitic rocks, and to plutonic rocks in general, is well exhibited in 
such granites as that of Shap, where crystals of Orthoclase, often 
184 
more than an inch in length, form a conspicuous feature in almost 
every specimen of the rock.
On a smaller scale they occur, again, 
in sucli dykes as that of Armboth.
Felspar crystals, resulting 
from metamorphic action, occur in several areas contiguous to 
great masses of plutonic rock, such as the granites.
Good 
examples of this may be seen in the metamorphosed tuffs of Bala 
age in the neighbourhood of Shap Wells, and at Shap summit 
cutting.
Mr. Ward has mentioned several other localities where 
phenomena of the same nature may be observed.
The species of the Felspar Group yet noted as occurring in 
Cumberland and Westmorland are Orthoclase, Oligoclase, 
Labradorite, Andesine, Albite, and Microcline.
Mr. Bryce 
M. Wright mentions the occurrence of Glassy Felspar in a 
Molybdena vein on Carrick.
If this is Sanidine, that would add 
another species to the members of the group already enumerated.
The remarks made under the last heading apply to some extent 
also to the members of the Mica group, which stand next.
' There 
are, however, some facts connected with the mode of occurrence 
of Mica that call for remark.
Mica occurs exclusively as a rock- 
constituent with us.
It is found under three conditions — -(i) cognate 
with the rock, as in the Mica of granites and other plutonic rocks ; 
(2) as a product of metamorphism, as in the well-known Mica-schist 
of the Cawda; and (3) as 'a derivative material, as in ordinary 
sandstones.
The commonest species here are Biotite and 
Muscovite ; but other species, or sub-species, occur as occasional 
constituents of rocks.
It is a point of some interest to note that 
native Mica, like native quartz, in all but' exceptional cases, is 
conspicuous by its absence in nearly all the volcanic rocks of the 
Lake District.
This fact has a bearing of considerable importance 
upon the question of the correlation of the volcanic "Green Slates" 
of the Borradale Series with the detrital and sedimentary " Green 
Slates" of the Craven area,* near Ingleton and Horton in Ribbles- 
* It would be well to distinguish these Ingleton Green Slates by some local 
name, as their precise geological position has not been clearly made out.
I 
believe they are chiefly of true Bala age, like the lavas at Rake Brow, Melmerby ;

nuca,nd,e metamorphic series around the Cawda Granite have

structure :n these rocks as something quite independent of the 
ong,naI planes of bedding, instead of regarding it, as many other 
have done both before the date of his observation and since, as a 
case of foliation comcident with the original bedding of the rock.
This last view does not, of course, apply to the intensely-crumpled

Mica of metamorphic origin, or what I believe to be such, occurs

Beryl, the Alumino-glucinum Silicate.
So far as I know at 
present, the claim of the Beryl to be counted as a mineral from 
this locality rests on the identification of specimens now in the 
Museum at Keswick.
These specimens are from a vein traversing 
the volcanic rocks at Walla Crag, on the east side of Derwentwater, 
and are in the form of slender prisms about an inch and a quarter 
in length, by an eighth of an inch in diameter, and varying in 
colour from whitish grey to dark milk-blue.
There is no reason 
whatever why the Beryl should not be found here, as it has been 
found in similar rocks in other parts of the kingdom.
The Hydrous section of minerals belonging to the last series of 
silicates come next, and includes the Zeolites and Chlorites.
This section will, doubtless, hereafter prove to contain many more 
mineral species than present knowledge enables me to enumerate 
here now.
It is perhaps not unfair to previous observers to say 
that a critical examination of the rocks of the Lake District has 
only just been commenced, and that we .yet have much to learn 
on this subject and others allied to it.
Pectolite is occasionally found as a vein-mineral in some of 
the fissures traversing the sheet of basalt intruded into the Carbon- 
iferous rocks lying on the north-east side of the Pennine Fault.
This is the black rock so well-known under the name of the Whin 
Sill.* Pectolite occurs in the form of close-set aggregations of 
silky-looking acicular crystals of a light-grey colour, which extend 
from side to side ot the vein, in the same way as Actinolite does.
Calcite occurs in association with it ; perhaps because limestones 
at no very remote period, once covered the Whin where this 
mineral occurs.
One of the most important and most widely-diffused of the 
hydrated silicates, at least in the Older Palseozoic rocks of Cum- 
berland and Westmorland, is the mineral Chlorite.
It is to the 
presence of this mineral in a diffused state that the peculiar pale 
grey-green colour of so many of our volcanic rocks is due.
The 
* Whin, ill the North of England, means any rock hard enough to be em- 
ployed as road-metal, and is by no means restricted to Easalt.
Sill is used 
as an equivalent texni for sti-atum.
187 
Green Slates so largely quarried at Patterdale, and again near 
Ambleside, and so much used for roofing purposes even in Penrith 
and the neighbourhood, owe their peculiar glaucous tint to the 
abundant presence of this mineral.
Mr. Ward has treated of the 
mode of occurrence of Chlorite in these rocks in considerable 
detail in a paper printed in the Mineralogical Magazine^ No. 4, 
(1877).
The general conclusion he arrived at is that Chlorite 
represents a decomposition-product of several other minerals ; and 
that, under conditions of extreme metamorphism, it may again be 
converted into one or another of the anhydrous crystalline 
silicates.
The Chlorite group here has not yet been fully studied.
GiLBERTiTE, one of the hydrated forms of mica, occurs com- 
monly in connection with the granite of the Cawda, near the 
well-known lead mines.
Another hydrated silicate is represented by Vermiculite.
This 
mineral was first recognized as occurring in Cumberland, I believe, 
by Professor John Morris, F.R.S., who shewed that much of the 
crystalline matter occurring in the Eskdale and Bootle Granite 
previously regarded as mica, was really Vermiculite.
Probably a 
careful search would prove its existence in other localities as well.
Tourmaline, Boro-silicate, or its variety Schorl, occurs in 
the form of divergent groups of glossy dark-brown acicular crystals 
in the plutonic rocks of the Carrick Fell area.
One or two fine 
specimens collected from this locality are now in the Mineral 
Collection at the Carlisle Museum.
Schorl has also been recognized 
by Mr. Wilfrid Huddlestone, and by Mr. William Atkinson, of 
Knock, in the form of small radial groups of acicular crystals, 
which occur along divisional planes of the Quartz-felsite now so 
extensively-quarried by the Cumberland Road-Metal Company at 
Threlkeld.
It is also met with in small nests and veins in some 
of the metamorphosed tuffs of Bala age that occur in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Shap Granite.
Other localities are Tentergill, 
Braithwaite, and Skidda Foot.
Amongst the Silico-tantalates, Sphene, as a native mineral, has 
some claim to mention here.
It is most commonly met with in 
the boulders of Criffel or Dalbeattie Granite, so plentifully distri- 
188 
buted over certain parts of Cumberland and Westmorland.
It 
usually occurs in very small, wedge shaped, crystals, somewhat 
lustrous, and of a pale-brown colour, interspersed, sometimes 
plentifully, amongst the ordinary constituents of the granite 
mentioned.
MOLYBDATES.
In one of the gills running up from the Cawda to the west 
side of the summit of Carrick, several small mines have been 
opened out with a view to obtaining copper and lead.
Various 
ores of both these metals occur amongst the fault-breccia ; though 
miners have every reason to be impressed with the fact that 
variety is a more prominent feature connected with the minerals 
than is the abundance of any particular species of economic value.
Amongst the various decomposition-products arising from the long 
exposure of the mineral veins of this part to the action of meteoric 
causes is one that I believe to be Wulfenite.
Its occurrence at 
the locality referred to was noted in the Geol.
Mag. Dec.
I. Vol. I.
p. 565.
The mineral occurs in small and very thin prisms, like 
small scales, and is of a bright vitreous lustre and of an 
orange colour.
It occurs coating the rider, along with macles of 
Cerussite, with Anglesite, and with various other mineral species 
of more or less interest.
TUNGSTATES.
> 
Wolfram, Manganese-and Iron Tungstate, occurs chiefly at 
Brandy Gill in the quartz vein-stuff traversing the granite there.
It is found also at Godolfin Ball, and at Lockfells.
The Brandy 
Gill specimens do not differ in any noticeable respect from the 
specimens obtained in connection with Tinstone in Cornwall.
The proportion of Iron Tungstate to Manganese Tungstate varies 
considerably in specimens from different localities.
It is as 2:3 
at Lockfells, and as 4 : i at Godolfin Ball, according to Dana 
{Mineral.
5th ed.
p. 603).
Wolfram is used in the manufacture 
C)f tungstate of soda, which is employed as a mordant, and for 
rendering light dress-fabrics inflammable, as well as for hardening 
189 
Plaster of Paris.
An alloy formed of eighty per cent, of steel and 
twenty per cent, of tungsten possesses a degree of hardness that has 
never yet been obtained in the manufacture of steel [Bristow 
Mineralogy, p.
410).
The cost of transport, however, in the case 
of the localities herein named, is against the remunerative employ- 
ment of our supplies of this mineral.
Associated with Wolfram at Brandy Gill is the Calcium Tungstate 
ScHEELiTE.
This usually occurs in the form of tetragonal pyramids, 
more or less modified by other crystalline faces.
The specimens 
now obtainable at Brandy Gill are more or less decomposed.
The 
crystals are of the colour of Hock, and are lustrous and translucent.
Specimens an inch or more in length are not uncommon.
Good 
crystals are in the Museums at Carlisle, Keswick, and Penrith.
Stoltzite, Lead Tungstate, has already been mentioned as one 
of the rare minerals occurring at Force Crag Mine, near Keswick.
I have not seen the mineral from that locality ; but Mr. Bryce M.
Wright {op.
cit.) states that it occurs in the form of minute yellowish, 
or brownish, pyramidal crystals.
Sulphates.
Anhydrite occurs in connection with the hydrous Calcium 
sulphate Gypsum at Coat Hill.
Probably it will be found at other 
localities where Gypsum occurs, when proper search is made.
It 
is usually of a somewhat bluer tint than Gypsum, and it differs 
from that mineral sufficiently in hardness to be readily detected.
Celestine is said to have been obtained at Burton in Westmor- 
land, in limestone.
It is certainly one of the minerals that may 
be expected at many other localities, especially in connection with 
the argillaceous members of the New Red Series.
Barytes, Heavy Spar, sometimes called Cawk by the miners, 
the Barium Sulphate, is of common occurrence throughout nearly 
all the mineral veins of the two counties.
Specially fine and 
perfect crystals have been obtained from the mines in the neigh- 
bourhood of Milburn and Dufton ; especially from Silveraband.
One such crystal, the largest single crystal of Barytes ever found,*.
was obtained from the last-named locality, and was exhibited in 
190 
the Great Exhibition of 185 1.
It is now located in the Museum 
of Practical Geology.
It weighs over a hundredweight.
Ver)r 
fine crystals from the mines of the same district are in the British 
Museum Collection.
Beautiful sapphire-blue, pale milk-blue, or 
lead-blue crystals, and occasionally others of a clear rose-colour, 
are obtained from the West Cumberland hematite mines, 
especially from Hinniside and Frizington.
Considerable variety 
occurs in the form of crystals obtained from different local- 
ities ; and crystals of particular form, or of particular modes 
of occurrence, are so characteristic of particular localities, that 
practised mineralogists that have many specimens passing through 
their hands can often name unerringly the precise locality whence 
a particular specimen under notice may have been derived.
A 
careful investigation of these facts might throw considerable light 
upon many points, connected with the genesis of minerals, at 
present imperfectly-understood.
I have myself noted many ; but 
it is impossible to describe them without entering fully into 
crystallographic details ; which would be a little out of place in 
such papers as the present.
Mention has already been made* of the entire removal of large 
crystals of Barytes from the interior of investing masses of crystals 
of Calcite at Dufton.
A specimen illustrating this is exhibited in 
the Mineral Collection at Carlisle Museum.
Judging by its mode of occurrence, Barytes is, in many cases, 
one of the oldest vein-minerals, after quartz, that is found in the 
district.
Some of it is older than part of the quartz associated 
with it, because pseudomorphs of Barytes in quartz are not un- 
common ; especially in the vein-contents of the Caldbeck Fells.
Haematite, too, often replaces Barytes, and helps to prove their 
relative ages in these particular cases.
The British Museum 
collection contains pseudomorphs of Barytes after Barytocalcite, 
from Alston, and of Calamine after Barytes, from Rowtin Gill.
Anglesite, Lead Sulphate, occurs in bright, vitreous, translucent 
crystals, usually of no great size, in the vein-stuff traversing the 
Caldbeck Fells.
The largest crystals are obtained from Rowtin 
* Transactions of Cumb.
and West.

Gill and the adjoining mine of Red Gill.
In each case Anglesite 
is associated with Cerussite, Pyromorphite, Mimetisite, Linarite, 
and other ores of lead ; and it clearly represents one of the results 
of decomposition of the Galena.
Galena in the case of the ores 
of lead, seems to indicate the high-water-mark (if one may so 
phrase it), of the tide whose ebb is shewn by the decomposition- 
products just mentioned.
We can trace the course of the ebb 
without much difficulty ; but our knowledge of the sequence of 
events connected with the flow is very imperfect indeed.
Mention has before been made of the limited distribution of 
Anglesite as a decomposition-product of Galena as compared with 
Cerussite.
Mr. A.
Dick informs me that the absence of Anglesite 
in certain areas where Galena is undergoing decomposition is due 
to the fact that the sulphate of lead arising from the oxidation of 
the Galena is decomposed immediately it is formed if carbonate of 
lime is present.
The presence of Anglesite in the non-calcareous 
rocks of the Lake District, and its absence in the area where the 
mineral veins traverse limestone, is thus at once explained.
Anglesite is found at very few other localities in the two counties 
than the Caldbeck Fells ; and it is by no means of common 
occurrence even there.
Selenite, the crystalline form of the Hydrous Calcium Sulphate 
Gypsum, or Ha Plaister, is a native product of some commercial 
importance now-a-days.
Occasionally, but very rarely, it occurs 
as a decomposition-product in rocks, and in mineral veins ; but 
the chief supplies of the mineral are obtained from beds occurring 
in connection with the New Red — usually with some of the more- 
argillaceous members of that series.
Most of the Gypsum worked 
in Cumberland and Westmorland is obtained from the shales 
associated with, or on the horizon of, the ISIagnesian Limestone.
Its 
mode of occurrence seems to suggest, in some cases, that part of 
it is not exactly contemporaneous with the particular beds where 
it now occurs, but that (like the crystals of selenite occurring in 
the London Clay, the Oxford Clay, and other similar deposits, 
and like the chert and the flint in certain calcareous strata) it 
represents, in a segregated form, mineral matter that was originally 
192 
diffused throughout a considerable thickness of the associated 
rocks above.
This view is quite compatible with the theory 
regarding the origin of gypseous deposits advanced by Sterry Hunt, 
and advocated by Sir Andrew Ramsay and others, namely, that 
most of them represent deposits accumulated in great inland 
lakes.
The preservation of our beds of gypsum is, I think, largely due 
to the fact that they occur in the midst of what are practically 
water-tight strata.
The gypsum in almost any quarry one may 
examine is manifestly disappearing so fast under the dissolving 
influence ot surface waters that it may be matter for wonder how 
any of it has been preserved so near the surface at all.
The explan- 
ation I believe to be the true one is that all the portions of the 
strata that had had their gypsum carried away in solution before the 
Glacial Period were cleared off the face of the country along with 
other weathered rock when the great ice-sheet swept the district 
from end to end.
It was to this same cause, as I have elsewhere 
shewn,* that all the preglacially-weathered limestone of the Carbon- 
iferous areas owes its removal.
The rock was scraped off down to 
where sound-and unweathered stone occurred, and it is at this 
point that the action of the weather is just beginning again to 
reassert its sway.
In connection with the origin of gypsum we have yet to leam 
whether its initial stage was that of Anhydrite, or whether Anhydrite ' 
represents a dehydrated form of the commoner mineral.
Occasionally, beautifully lustrous, and satiny, deposits of fibrous 
gypsum occur.
One such may be well examined in the south 
bank of the Eden at Windanwath.
Specimens from this locality 
are exhibited in the county Museum at Carlisle.
Gypsum occurs in the Upper Red Shales or Stanwix Marls as 
well : probably, as it usually does on this horizon, in association 
with Salt.
None of the Chromates seem yet to have been recorded from 
Cumberland and Westmorland localities.
One of the rare minerals occurring at RowtinGill is Brochantite.
* Geological Magazine, article on "Glacial Erosion." 
193 
This occurs in the form of encrusting groups of minute and brilliant 
dark-green crystals, generally lining cavities in the vein-stuff.
Usually it is associated with fibrous malachite, and with matter of 
a more or less ochreous nature.
It was discovered as a Cumber- 
land mineral by Mr. Bryce M.
Wright, who, as a native of Caldbeck 
had abundant opportunities of making himself acquainted with the 
minerals of Cumberland.
Good specimens of Brochantite are in 
each of our local museums.
Without doubt the most beautiful of all the minerals obtained 
from the Caldbeck Fells, or, perhaps, from any locality in the two 
counties, is the Sulphato-Carbonate of Lead named Linarite, 
from Linares, in Spain, whence some of the earliest-known speci- 
mens of the mineral were obtained.
In Cumberland it occurs 
chiefly at Rowtin Gill and the adjoining mine of Red Gill.
At 
each locality it occurs in the form of thin, tabular crystals, usually 
of small size, of a bright-vitreous lustre and of a brilliant blue 
colour.
It is found in association with Cerussite, Anglesite, and 
other ores of lead, as well as of copper, in the fault-breccia of the 
veins of that district.
The mines have not been much worked of 
late years, and Cumberland specimens are therefore now becoming 
somewhat difficult to procure.
But good specimens exist in the 
museums at Carlisle, Keswick, and Penrith ; and there is a fine 
series in the splendid collection of the British Museum.
At Rowtin Gill and Red Gill Linarite and some of the minerals 
generally associated with it are found chiefly in the outer parts of 
the veins and near to the bottom of the valley.
In the outer parts 
of the same veins nearer to the fell-tops, the assemblage of minerals 
is of a somewhat different kind, and includes species that, to say 
the least of it, are decidedly rare at lower levels.
The same 
phenomena have been noticed elsewhere, and have been alluded 
to on a former occasion.
In connection with the extraordinary variety of decomposition- 
products found along with Linarite in the Rowtin Gill area, there 
are many facts that yet await a satisfactory explanation.
It is just 
possible that the peculiarly-complex and varied nature of the rocks 
of that particular district may have had some share in contributing, 
]4 
194 
by their own decomposition, some oi the constituents that have 
entered into fresh combinations with the products of decomposition 
arising from the action of percolating waters upon the contents of 
the mineral veins.
Another factor to be taken into account is the 
great length of exposure of the fell-tops here, as compared with 
other parts adjoining.
This, of itself, must have led to great 
complexity in the contents of the mineral veins, as there must 
have been ample time under such circumstances for many minerals 
that had crystallized as decomposition-products in the lower parts 
of a vein to be again and again dissolved and afterwards recombined, 
often under different circumstances, with mineral matter of a totally 
different kind.
The decomposition of the various sulphides, of 
phosphates like Apatite, of Wolfram, of Mispickel, as well as of 
the varied assortment of silicates associated with the veins of the 
Caldbeck Fell area has had a very important influence in bringing 
about great variety in the mineral constituents of the waters perco- 
lating down from the surface, as successively lower portions of the 
veins were exposed by denudation.
Caledonite is another rare mineral found in the same two 
mines; though it has been found more often at Red Gill than 
at Rowtin Gill.
It occurs in the form of small crystals of a bluish- 
green colour, ranging between turquoise-blue to what is known 
as peacock-green.
These are found shooting inwards towards the 
centres of the cavities in the quartz-rider.
Leadhillite is yet another of the rare mineral species found at 
the same localities as the last, and often found associated with it, 
and Linarite, Cerussite, Anglesite, etc., in the same specimen.
Usually it occurs in the form of small tabular crystals, cleavable 
with great facility in one particular direction, and otherwise bearing 
a close resemblance to white mica.
It is usually brilliantly-lustrous, 
and is clear and colourless.
Crystals over an inch across have 
occasionally been met with at Red Gill ; but it is usually in smaller 
crystals than that.
Hydrous Arsenates.
Ervthrine, Erythrite, Cobalt-Bloom, Cobalt Ochre, the Hydrous 
Cobalt Arsenate, is found at Force Crag Mine, near Keswick, at 
195 
Tyne Bottom Mine near Alston, and in a cross-vein in connection 
with the Copper Mines at Coniston, just outside the district herein 
more especially referred to.
It usually occurs in association with 
the vein-stuff in faults, in the form of an earthy, powdery, or 
chalky-looking encrustation, with a general tint of peach-blossom 
red, which ranges in one direction to pale puce, and in the other 
to carnation.
The mineral is rare at each locality named, and it 
does not occur in well-crystallized forms at any one of them.
Pharmacosiderite, the Hydrous Iron Arsenate, occurs in the 
form of small cubes of a brilliant lustre, and a dark sage-green 
colour, Hning cavities in ferruginous rider in Burdle Gill.
This 
seems to be the only known locality in the district under notice.
Olivenite, the Hydrous Copper Arsenate, occurs at Tyne 
Head Mine, Alston, also in connection with mineral veins.
It 
occurs along with Malachite in minute acicular crystals, of a sage- 
green or olive-green tint, and highly lustrous, lining cavities in the 
rider or vein-stuff.
Another locality for this mineral is Goldscope 
Mines, near Keswick.
It does not appear yet to have been 
detected in the Caldbeck Fell area ; though all the conditions 
requisite for its formation appear to be present at several localities, 
especially at Brandy Gill.
Phosphates.
Apatite, Calcium Phosphate, is found in the form of rather 
small prismatic crystals, dispersed, in places somewhat plentifully, 
throughout the granite of the Brandy Gill area.
Pyromorphite, Green Ore, which is usually regarded simply as 
a Lead Phosphate, is found, in some abundance, in the vein-stuff 
of the higher parts of the Rowtin Gill area, especially near the 
surface.
It is usually in the form of very perfect prisms, varying 
in tint from yellow of various shades to dull green.
In small 
quantities it is occasionally met with at several other mines in the 
district adjoining ; and it occurs also, in smaller quantities still, in 
the lead veins of the Alston district, as well as those of the Escarp- 
ment.
Small crystals are now and then met with at Helton, east 
of Appleby ; but in nothing like the same perfection as the crystals 
196 
from the Caldbeck Fells.
A chromiferous variety is occasionally 
found in the Caldbeck Fells.
MiMETisiTE, MiMETiTE, Kampylite, the Lead Arseno-phosphate, 
occurs chiefly at Dry Gill, a short distance to the east of Rowtin 
Gill.
It is associated, on the vein-quartz of that part, with Pyrolu- 
site, and other ores of Manganese, and it occurs in the form of small 
barrel-shaped aggregations of crystals, which present a cross-section 
of an hexagonal form.
The staves of the barrel, if one may so 
speak of them, are usually as smooth and bright as if they each 
really represent a single veritable face of crystallization, notwith- 
standing that the faces of the staves are considerably curved.
This 
is another point connected with the minerals of our district that 
yet requires to be worked out.
Another point in connection with 
the same mineral is, why it should be present in one particular 
vein where there are no traces of other compounds of either Arsenic 
or Phosphorus, while in an adjoining vein where Arsenates, Phos- 
phates, and ores of lead are decomposing in the same vein, this 
particular mineral should be rare or entirely absent.

LOCAL ENTOMOLOGY.
Part 4.
By GEO.
DAWSON.
(Read at Carlisle.) 
CUSPIDATES.
These form the smallest group of moths we have, as there are 
only thirty-three species of them found in the British Isles.
Of 
these I have found eighteen in this locality.
These moths are 
easily distinguished from any other in either the larva state or that 
of the perfect insect.
All the larvje of this group have humps on 
their backs ; and some have, in addition, a kind of horny tail.
The perfect individual insects are very variable in coloration.
This, I think, may arise chiefly from differences in the nature of 
their food ; and partly, also, from the nature of their surroundings.
The first species I shall take is — 
The Pebble Prominent {Notodonta ziczac).
The larva of this 
moth is very variable in coloration.
The commonest variety has 
the head dark brown, and the remainder of the body brown of a 
paler shade.
They have three humps of a pale pink colour on 
their backs, and the abdomen is of a light green.
This variety is 
taken at Newby Cross on the sallows, as well as on the small 
poplars that grow in the wood there.
Those I have taken at 
Orton and at Thurstonfield are much brighter in colour, and they 
are also larger.
At these localities I find them more commonly 
on the small birch trees.
The larvje here have the head of a bright 
brown, and about half of the body is of the same bright colour ; 
202 
while the three dorsal humps are of a bright salmon-colour with a 
few rows of pale-green markings running through them.
Their 
abdomen is of a very rich green, and at the end of the body is a 
small hump, which is of a very bright pink colour.
The differences 
in coloration in the larvte from the two localities mentioned arise, 
I believe, partly from the nature of the food-plant, and partly from 
that of the situation where they are found.
Those found at Newby 
Cross are from the large fir-wood, and their paler colour and duller 
tints result from the shady nature of their surroundings.
The 
larvse taken at Orton and at Thurstonfield, on the other hand, are 
chiefly found in open situations ; and I think that the sunlight 
has, in this case, had something to do in developing the brighter 
colours observed.
Besides the food-plants mentioned, I have 
taken these larvEe on sallows, especially at Thurstonfield, where 
the insect is sometimes found in great numbers on the sallows 
growing on the Moss.
A few remarks upon the best method of collecting the larvae of 
this group may, perhaps, be of some service.
The perfect insect 
itself can be captured but seldom, and in such cases they are 
generally found on the trunk of trees, or on old palings.
There 
is only one species of the group that may be taken on gas lamps ; 
so that if it is desired to make anything like a complete collection 
of the Cuspidates, it becomes necessary to rear the insects from 
the larvae.
For larva-collecting it is necessary to be provided with 
a large umbrella, or else with a piece of wrapping about two yards 
square, and also with a stout stick to beat the trees with.
Open 
the umbrella (stick upwards), or spread out the wrapping under 
the tree chosen for operations ; but, before beating, carefully search 
for any leaves that may be attached together by the edges, and 
examine them for the larvs they may contain.
Then bend the 
branches over the sheet and strike them smartly with the stick, 
with the object of shaking off any larvse that may be feeding 
thereon.
Large numbers of individuals, including, occasionally, 
many species not attainable in any other way, may be collected in 
the manner described.
Carefully put the larvas into a collecting- 
box, and sort them as soon after as possible, as there are many 
species that will devour the others in a very short time.
The 
larvae of the Cuspidates do not roll themselves into a ring when 
they fall, and they may be known also by their having from one to 
four small humps on their bodies, and by their having but little 
hair; they are, besides, very active when touched.
Any that 
present these characteristics, it will generally be safest to place by 
themselves, for the greater number of them are almost sure to prove 
cannibals, which will attack and devour both larvae and pupae of 
other insects, and in a single day a batch of them will often destroy 
the results of a whole season's collecting.
They do not eat the 
whole body of any larva they may attack ; but will crawl about the 
cage, and fasten at the back of the head of any larva they may 
meet with and keep their hold there until their victim falls dead to 
the bottom of the cage, when they renew the attack on another.
In this way I have seen one of these larvae destroy seven others in 
the course of about half an hour.
At that time I had only one 
breeding cage ; but now, profiting by experience, I have three 
made of wood and muslin for the more peaceful kinds, and one 
made of glass and zinc, perforated at the ends, specially for the 
accomodation of larvae that will not live amicably with the other 
kinds.
Geometer larvae especially suffer from the attacks of these 
Cuspidates, as they are very delicate, and a slight grasp will suffice 
to kill them.
The Geometer pupae are delicate likewise, and I 
believe that they are a favourite prey of the larvae specially under 
notice.
Whenever it is possible, the better plan in collecting is to 
keep the larvae in separate boxes from the first, and if they are 
taken up in small boxes, these can be placed open in the breeding- 
cages, and the larvae will soon crawl out by themselves, and so 
save the risk of injury liable to be caused by having to handle 
them.
Lepidopterous larvae that have been much handled fre- 
quently develop crippled or otherwise imperfect imagos, with the 
wings curled up like dried leaves, so that no one could set them 
in a satisfactory manner.
In searching for the larvae of the 
Cuspidates search the trees carefully when the leaves are falling, 
looking out especially for small clusters of withered leaves.
On 
304 
opening them you will often find that they contain pupa.
Some 
will be those of the Geometers ; while others will contain the pupae 
of one or other of the Cuspidates.
The best trees to search are 
the Sallow, the Birch, and the Oak ; though there is some difficulty 
in the case of the last-named, on account of its height.
Still there 
will generally be a few small oaks in every locality.
After searching 
the withered leaves referred to, the next thing to do is to carefully 
examine the branches and the trunk for pupse ensconced in the 
crevices of the bark.
This part of the work requires the greatest 
care, for the caterpillar, when selecting a site for changing to pupa, 
seems to exercise great care in the selection, so that the crevice 
not only holds the pupa exactly, but the nature of the surroundings 
are usually such as to afford the helpless pupa the fullest possible 
protection against the attacks of its many enemies.
On looking at 
the surroundings of the pupa of the Puss Moth, for example, one 
cannot help wondering how the perfect insect can manage to 
emerge unhurt from so hard and close-fitting a case as that where 
it is found.
Next turn attention to the roots of the trees.
Remove 
all the moss, and carefully examine that first, as many pupae are 
easily overlooked, as they are more like a fine lock of tangled wool 
than the cocoon of a caterpillar.
In flimsy cocoons of this kind 
many different species may be found.
The loose leaves at the 
root of a tree are another favourite place for larvse ; these must, 
therefore, be searched as carefully as the moss just referred to.
Then, with a trowel, dig up the earth around the roots.
Each 
trowel-full of earth should be spread out on a piece of paper, and 
be carefully examined for pupae.
Great care is required, as the 
pupje that form an earthy cocoon are with difficulty distinguished 
from the earth surrounding them.
The other pupse may be found 
easily enough.
It is often stated that the south- or the south-west 
side of a tree is the best for finding pupae.
But, so far as my 
experience goes, this rule does not invariably hold good.
The 
form of the tree itself, and the locality where it may happen to be 
growing are often points of much importance to attend to.
If it is 
near water, the side of the tree nearest to that will always yield 
most pupa;.
Again, it the tree is growing near the middle of a 
205 
field where cattle or where sheep are grazing, the pupae will usually 
be found close to the tree.
In a wood, the pupse will be found 
mostly about six inches from the trunk ; though some species are 
found as many feet, or even yards, away from their feeding place.
Very good trees for pup£e-hunting are birches, growing in a hedge.
These will repay a careful search through the Winter and the early 
Spring; and if they are looked over in May, June, July, and 
August, there will generally be found some pupse or larvae to 
reward one for the trouble.
The Willow and the Sallow are also 
good trees to find larvae on, as certain early moths make use of 
the catkins of these trees as their only food.
In the Spring I have 
seen over seventy moths fall from one sallow, where they were 
busy depositing their ova after emerging from hybernation.
The 
insects that make use of the Willows as food-plants are, generally 
speaking, early to appear in the perfect condition; while those 
that feed on the Oak and the Ash and other trees coming later into 
leaf are generally of late appearance.
The Scalloped Hook-tip {Platypteryx lacertula).
Found in good 
numbers at Newby Cross, Newbiggen, Orton, and Thurstonfield, 
in June and July.
Newman does not record this species from 
Scotland, nor from the Northern Counties.
This species is best 
taken with the net, after beating birch trees.
The larvae are easily 
found on the same trees, either in a cluster of leaves, or else 
hanging from the trees.
The Pebble Hook-tip {P.
falculd).
Found in all our woods 
where the birch grows.
I have taken them from the early part of 
May up to the middle of September.
Newman considers that 
they are double-brooded ; but I have never found any larvae except 
in September.
They are very pretty, of a pale green with a yellow 
stripe along each side.
The pupa of this moth can easily be found 
in the proper localities, as the larva spins up a birch leaf, and the 
pupa often remains on the tree long after all the other leaves are 
gone.
The Chinese Character {Cilix spinuld).
This, one of the 
smallest and prettiest of the group, may be found in the early 
206 
summer mornings sitting on blades of grass, whence they may be 
lifted without their making any attempt to fly.
When the sun is 
up they are very active, and the least touch with your stick amongst 
the bushes near them will set them off.
They are then very 
troublesome to take.
I have never met with either the larva or 
the pupa of this species.
The Sallow Kitten {Dicranura furcula).
I have found this 
insect in great numbers at the Cemetery, Newby Cross, and 
Thurstonfield, in the autumn of last year (1883).
The larvae are 
most plentiful about the middle of August.
The Poplar Kitten (D.
bifida).
This is the larger and the 
rarer of the two species of Dicraiiura we get here.
I have found 
Newby Cross to be the best locality for it.
The larva is full grown 
about the middle of August.
When beating for larvse this one is 
difficult to shake from the food-plant, as it clings with so firm a 
grasp.
They change to pupa in the bark of the tree, which they 
resemble so strongly in colour that they can be found only with 
difficulty.
The Puss Moth (Z?.
vimild).
A very common species here, 
and one that can be found along the banks of our rivers in May 
and June at night.
The larvae are easily found, for they strip 
parts of the twigs of willows, and of poplars, bare of leaves to such 
an extent as to attract attention at once.
The colour of this larva 
varies a good deal.
In some, the markings along the back are of 
a very bright purple, and the sides are of a bright pink spotted 
with black.
The head bears considerable resemblance to that of 
a cat, especially in the character of its markings.
The cocoon of 
this moth is very hard, and is difficult to distinguish from the bark 
where it is located.
The larvae can be found from the end of 
June up to the end of October.
I have found them in all the 
localities where I have collected where the Narrow-leaved Willows 
grow.
Seldom more than two individuals are to be found on any 
single tree.
I believe they feed more by night than by da;y, as I 
have watched great numbers of them alive, and have never seen 
them attempt to take any food by day.
When they are at rest 
207 
both theii; head and their tail are held quite erect.
They hold to 
their food-plant very firmly.
The Sprawler {Petasia cassinea).
The larva of this moth bears 
a very bad character amongst entomologists, as it has a habit of 
destroying any other larvsB it may find in the same breeding-cage 
with itself.
I have taken them commonly on the oaks at Orton.
When beaten from the branches they are very restless.
In colour 
the larvae are of a pale green, with three yellow stripes along the 
body.
This is one of the latest to appear ; I have found them 
from the middle of October up to the end of December.
The Buff-tip {Fygcera btuephala).
This beautiful moth is one of 
the commonest of the family ; and I think there is hardly a tree 
that grows here that does not serve as the food-plant of this species.
It is the only one of the Cuspidates whose larvae are to be found 
in large broods.
I have seen as many as three broods on one 
tree, and their habit of stripping off all the leaves around their 
feeding place renders their discovery a comparatively-easy matter.
The moth appears in June ; and the larva from July up to the end 
of October.
The Small Chocolate-tip ( Clostera redusa).
This is the smallest 
of the Cuspidates, and one that [though generally distributed over 
both England and Ireland] is locally confined to rather limited areas.
They occur in great numbers at Orton and Newby Cross.
I have 
never taken the moth either on the wing or at rest ; though I have 
reared hundreds from the larvae, which were usually collected from 
the Dwarf Sallow.
From its earliest stage this larva is in the habit 
of sheltering itself by drawing together the edges of leaves, and in 
a shelter of this kind it changes to pupa.
The Pale Prominent {Ptilophora \Ptilodontd\ palphia).
This 
very strange-looking moth I have found only in one locality here 
— at Orton.
They are very common near Langholm.
The perfect 
insect I have never taken.
The larva is a very rough-looking 
creature, with the skin very much wrinkled.
It feeds on both the 
Willow and the Poplar.
The pupa I have taken by pulling up the 
308 
coarse grass that grows in wet ground at the foot of these trees and 
then shaking the delicate cocoons out of the grass roots.
The Coxcomb Prominent {Nolodonta camelind).
This moth is 
generally distributed throughout this district.
They occur in great 
numbers at Wragmire Moss.
They are often taken when at rest 
on trees, old palings, or gas-lamps.
The larva is easily taken by 
beating the birch, or the oak.
The pupa may be found at the 
roots of trees, almost without any covering over them, about the 
early part of October.
The moth is on the wing during the whole 
of the summer.
The Swallow Prominent {N.
dictad) ; The Lesser Swallow- 
Prominent {N.
dictaoides).
These two moths differ from each 
other only by a small mark on the upper wings ; so that they are 
often confounded in collections.
Both forms occur here, and are 
often taken while resting on old palings, tree trunks, and stone 
walls.
Hardly a season passes without someone obtaining the one 
or the other from the Castle walls.
The larvae of each is like the 
other; and both feed on the same trees — the Sallow and the Birch.
I have taken them at Orton, Thurstonfield, Newby Cross, and 
'W^ragmire Moss.
The pupoe are often met with while searching 
for others, and generally about the end of October.
The larva 
spins a slim cocoon, and attaches it to the earth, just below the 
surface, and close to the tree.
They always draw a leaf over 
themselves, and this too is attached to the tree.
In searching for 
the pupae it is well not to turn out too much soil at once, or there 
will be a risk of losing them.
The Iron Prominent {N.
drotnedarius).
This form closely 
resembles the two last both in habit and mode of occurrence.
They are very easily reared.
The Pebble Prominent {N.
ziczac).
This, one of the commonest 
of the Cuspidates, is very irregular in its time of appearance.
I 
have had them coming out in my cages from March until the early 
part of August.
The Great Prominent {N.
trepidd).
The only specimen I have 
209 
taken here (now exhibited) was found in one of my breeding cages 
in May, 1881, along with other insects that I had certainly collected 
from various localities near here ; but how it came into the cage I 
do not know for certain.
The Figure of Eight Moth {Diloba coiruleocephald).
This is a 
common species wherever it occurs at all.
If you find a place 
where they once occur, they may usually be met with there at the 
right season at any future time.
I have collected great numbers 
of them at Cummersdale ; and about four years ago I took forty 
of them to Bellevue, where they are now well established.
The 
larvae are found about the end of June, feeding on the Whitethorn, 
and the Blackthorn.
They spin a tough cocoon, and remain in 
the pupa state about six weeks.
I have taken only three of them 
on the wing, and have never captured any at rest.
Like the rest 
of the Cuspidates, they have to be reared from the larv* if it is 
desired to make anything like a complete collection.

LOCAL SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND 
MEMORANDA.
Wildfowl near Carlisle.— Examples of the following species 
were shot during the Autumn of 1883, and the Spring of 1884, the 
weather being very open, and fowl unusually wild : — Bernicle 
Goose, Bean Goose, Sheldrake, Goosander, Mallard, Shoveller, 
Wigeon, Scaup, Tufted-Duck, Common Scoter, Goldeneye, Long- 
tailed Duck, Teal, and Garganey Teal.
In addition to the foregoing, most of which I saw on many 
occasions, I twice met with single Pintails (one drake and one 
duck).
Grey Lag Geese visited the Esk, and a Great Crested 
Grebe was shot on the Eden near Carlisle.
In 1883, the first Wigeon were shot on Burgh Marsh on 
September 22nd.
Bernicle Geese arrived on October 6th, 1883, 
and lingered until April 19th, 1884.

The Longtailed Duck.
— When visiting Monkhill Lough on 
Januarj' 24th, 1884, I was pleased to find an example of this 
northern species (which rarely visits Cumberland,) harbouring at 
the narrow extremity of this small piece of water.
Though 
frequently fired at, it continued to haunt the Lough until March 
212 
1 9th, when it was shot, and proved to be an immature male.
It 
had afforded me many excellent opportunities of studying its habits, 
though very shy.
Once, at the close of a violent shower of sleet, 
it flew towards me and pitched on the water in a direct line with 
the bush behind which I was lying.
It fed by diving at the 
narrow end of the Lough, and often associated with some Golden- 
eyes.
It was very reluctant to take wing ; but, when it did so, 
would fly round and round the Lough at a great height, with a 
peculiar motion of the wings, which readily distinguished it from 
the other wildfowl.
When swimming rapidly, it appeared to cut through the water, 
but when resting quietly bore a rude resemblance to a small gull.
The fact of its having frequented a small piece of fresh water for 
so many weeks appears to be diametrically opposed to the usual 
habits of this sea-loving species.

Additions to the published Lists of Cumberland Plants.
— Ranunculus fluitans has flowered most freely this year in the 
Eden — where it is about the most common plant there is — on 
account, we suppose, of the long low state of the river.
The 
flowering plants growing in shallow- and quiet water, were always 
shorter in the leaves than those growing in the streams, which did 
not flower.
On July 4th, near to Crosby, we found a very fine plant 
with all the flowers double.
Myriophyllutn spicatum occurs in the 
Caldew.
Stachys ambigua, on Dalston Green.
Rumex nemorosus, 
v. satigui7iius, at Thurstonfield.
R. hydrolapathum, Moss Pool, 
near Woodside.
Valeriana pyrenaica was growing very rank this 
summer (1884) in a plantation called the Gap, about two miles 
from Longtown.
This plant, according to Hooker's " Student's 
Flora," is not indigenous.
It gives out a most off"ensive smell 
when decaying.
Habenaria albida grows by the side of Derwent- 
water.
An old station for the rare Cephalanthera ensifolia has 
been rediscovered this year near Talkin, Brampton.

The Carlisle Water Supply.
— An amusing note on this 
subject appears in the "Carlisle Journal" of October loth, 1884.
The writer comments on the "ancient and fish-like smell" which 
occasionally characterizes the Carlisle Water Supply, and notices 
its likeness to a similar shortcoming in that of Manchester, where 
it has.
been found to result from the presence of multitudes of 
pond-snails.
These creatures "deposited their spawn on the sides 
and bottoms of the reservoirs, and the decomposition of this mass 
imparted the taint to the water." The remedy applied at Man- 
chester has been the introduction into the reservoirs of trout and 
char to keep down the snails ; and the writer in the " Carlisle 
Journal" suggests — though somewhat doubtfully — a similar plan 
at Carlisle.
Fish, however, and their products, are, in their turn, 
as liable to decompose as snails or snail-spawn, while the intro- 
duction of otters to keep down the fish hardly promises to prove a 
satisfactory settlement of that difficulty.
Carlisle, however, has 
many geological advantages over Manchester, inasmuch as the 
structure of its neighbourhood insures an ample supply of water 
from the sinking of an artesian well ; water infinitely superior in 
quality to that now obtained from the Eden.
Such a well, sunk 
in the district of Harker, would tap the copious supply of water in 
the Kirklinton and St. Bees Sandstones, beneath the surface beds, 
and provide Carlisle with a supply of water second to none in the 
kingdom.

Section North of Silloth.
— Mr. Goodchild has sent me an 
account of a recently exposed section on the coast a little north of 
Silloth.
The low foreshore consists of tough boulder clay.
Above 
it rises a belt of fine clay, covered in its turn by blown sand, which 
is now being cut back at a faster rate than the tougher clay below.
The most interesting point about this section was the fact pointed out 
to Mr. Goodchild by Dr. Leitch of Silloth, that the surface of the 
fine clay had been regularly drained, and that it exhibited the most 
unmistakeable evidences of the action of the plough, the furrows 
814 
remaining perfectly distinct.
In short, the remains of a ploughed 
field covered up by blown sand, were exposed to view at this part 
of the coast, a striking piece of evidence, pointing to the much 
greater extension of the land westward at no very remote period.
So few are the sections on the Solway, and so sudden and unfore- 
seen the changes on its shore — as the first years of the fourteenth 
century bear witness — that the [fact of competent observers like 
Dr. Leitch being on the spot to record points of so much interest] 
is a matter on which we may well congratulate ourselves.

SiLLOTH New Dock.
— Mr. J.
G. Goodchild has kindly sent 
me notes of his observations of the strata exposed in the excavations 
for Silloth New Dock, which he visited with Dr. Leitch and Rev.
Mr. Williams last April.
The beds seen consisted of alternations 
of sand and well-rounded, false-bedded gravel, resting on a chocolate 
clay.
The clay contained both local and far-derived boulders, 
CrifFel Granite, Ennerdale Syenite, Grassmoor grits; tuffs and lavas 
in abundance.
Scarcely any St. John's Quartz-Felsjte was seen.
The mammalian remains {Bos pritnigetiius, Sic ) were found at or 
near the base of the sand and gravel.
This upper formation also 
contained the remains of recent littoral shells, the genera Littorina, 
Ostrea, Trophon, Fusus, Cardium, Tellina, Peden and Mactra 
being all represented.
The chocolate clay beneath was evidently 
of much earlier date, and belonged to the Glacial Drift, the sand 
and gravel being an upheaved recent marine deposit or raised 
beach.
Mr. Goodchild noticed that the thin layers of sand and 
gravel making up the raised beach all sloped downwards from the 
sea towards the land, the direction of the current depositing them 
being thus indicated.
The range of this raised beach is shown in 
the map illustrating the physical geography of north-west Cumber- 
land, Trans.

Changes of Channel in the Solway.
— In Part vi.
Trans.
Cumb.
Assoc, are maps showing the changes in the Solway 
channels between the years 1841 and 1877.
The channels E.
of 
Bowness are not shown in the Admiralty Chart of the Solway 
published at the latter date ; but on comparing the older chart 
with the Ordnance maps showing the Scottish and English shores 
of that estuary, and dated respectively i86t and 1869, we see the 
following variations.
In the chart 1837-41 the channel of the 
Eden between Rockcliff and Glasson keeps close to the southern 
shore.
In the Dumfriesshire map of 1861 the Eden is seen 
making directly for the Scottish side, and effecting a junction with 
the Esk about half a mile S.
of Tordoff Point.
While in the 
Cumberland map of 1869 the Eden keeps as closely to the English 
shore as in 1841.
In the survey of the coast published in the 
"Gentleman's Magazine" in 1748, and quoted by Hutchinson, 
(Vol. ii.
p. 401,) it is remarked: — "The river Eden has of late 
years kept almost close under the Scottish shore; but its 
course is constantly varying." This variability in the Solway 
channels is so well known that it is somewhat surprising to read in 
the "Carlisle Journal" of September 5th (1884), that at a Special 
Meeting of the Eden Fishery Board, a letter from the Home 
Secretary had been read in which he suggested that the boundary 
line in the Solway should be the middle of the channel at low 
water — scarcely a " scientific frontier," under the circumstances.
With the existing relations between England and Scotland, it is 
surely as absurd to have different fishery relations on the northern 
and southern sides of the Solway as it would be on those of the 
Humber,

Ancient Lake Dwellings in Galloway.
— Articles in the 
' Times " of September Sth and i6th describe investigations among 
the crannoges of Galloway.
The following remarks, however, are 
not intended to serve as an abstract of the articles in question, but 
as notes of matters likely to afford useful hints to future explorers 
21Q 
in Cumberland.
The first crannoge selected for examination by 
the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archpeological Association was 
situated in the centre of a peatmoss in Mochram parish, this 
summer being especially favourable on account of the long drought.
In the centre of this moss, which is about sixty acres in 
extent, there is a circular enclosure fifty-four feet in diameter, 
surrounded by a low wall, the whole surface of the enclosure being 
green with grass, while the surrounding moss is covered with 
heather and bog plants.
The moss around this crannoge had 
grown up to its level since its construction, and it appears that in 
a laborious and accurate map, pubhshed in the year 1672, the 
present moss appears as a lake.
A crannoge in the bed of Bar- 
happle lake, in Old Luce parish, which was drained off in 1878, is 
described by the writer in the " Times " as measuring one hundred 
and fifty-seven yards in circumference.
The country in its neigh- 
bourhood is said to be now bleak and treeless.
" Low drums or 
sow-backs, so characteristic of a glacier-scraped country, rise out 
of vast tracts of peatmoss." Barhapple Loch was of small extent, 
some five hundred yards long by three hundred broad.
The piles 
of the causeway connecting this crannoge with the shore extended 
for seventy-five yards, there being a space of ten yards without any, 
either for the passage of canoes or the erection of a defensive 
movable bridge.
At Dowalton we learn that a great part of the 
bed of the lake (now drained) is soHd rock of the Lower Silurian 
formation, rising here and there into dome-like roches moutonnees, 
beautifully striated and scraped by the ancient land ice.
Some of 
the crannoges there are built against these masses of rocks, pro- 
jecting from them into the muddy alluvium around.
When 
Dowalton Loch was drained in 1S63, the crannoges only became 
visible as the water receded.
The " Times " writer thinks that 
their submergence was due not merely to the collapse of their 
material, but to an elevation in the level of the lake-surface.
Owing to the invisibility of the crannoges before drainage, nothing 
of archaeological interest had been expected.
It is interesting to 
note, therefore, that there was a vague local tradition in this case, 
that a village lay beneath the waters of the loch.

The Probable Existence ok Lake Dwellings in Cumber- 
land.
— There can be little reason to doubt that the Lake Country 
of Cumberland and Westmorland must once have furnished many 
eligible building sites to the ancient lake-dweller But situations 
much more like those of the Galloway crannoges cire very common 
in N.
Cumberland towards the shores of the Solway.
The Bowness 
peninsula especially abounds in them.
It is by no means improb- 
able that the great peatmoss which stretches from Cardurnock to 
Glasson may have been in the Roman period mainly or wholly a 
shallow lake, with islands rising from it here and there, as at 
Rogersceugh and towards Cardurnock.
Indeed the remains of 
such a lake (now drained) are shown in the map in Hutchinson's 
" History of Cumberland," between Cardurnock and Anthorn.
Near VVigton, again, N.E. of Oulton, we have Moorhouse (or 
Martin) Tarn, which must once have been about ten times its 
present size, the remainder of its former area being now peatmoss.
Then we have the singular group of former lakes and morasses in 
the neighbourhood of Rockcliff, the peaty portions of which may 
perhaps hide prehistoric remains of interest.
Hutchinson's map 
shows a small lake in this locality.
Many other promising neigh- 
bourhoods might be mentioned, but enough has been said to show 
that Cumberland is by no means destitute of spots likely to repay 
the explorer of ancient lake-dwellings.

Some Additional Notes on the Land and Freshwater 
Shells of Cumberland and Westmorland.
— In the Trans- 
actions, Part vii., 1881-82, p.
51, a list is given of the Land and 
Freshwater Shells found in Cumberland and Westmorland previous 
to that time.
I think it may now be of interest to record the 
names of the species which have since been found, as well as to 
give additional localities for some of the more uncommon species 
noticed before.
The number of species previously recorded was 
seventy-five, and to this number I now add three species, making 
a total of seventy-eight ; the names of five more varieties found in 
218 
the district are also given.
Of the seventy-five species of the 
former list, seven were mentioned as peculiar to Westmorland ; 
one of these, Pupa marginata, I have since found in Cumberland 
— the number is therefore reduced to six.
In the following list 
the species and varieties new to Cumberland and Westmorland 
are marked with an asterisk.
Pisidiimifo7itinale, Drap.
Pond at Corby.
Anodonta cygnea, L.
I obtained one specimen from ^ickerby Beck.
The 
shell is not fully grown, and it is thinner than those found in the 
Petteril at Wreay, though it ia of a similar olive brown colour.
*A.
anatina, L.
Eiver Petteril at Wreay.
The shell is beautifully rayed 
with green.
Limncea peregra, var.
laciistris, Leacli.
Mr. Madison of Birmingham has 
found this shell in Windermere.
L. peregra, var.
ovata, Drap.
I found some small specimens of L.
peregra 
in a pond at Blaithwaite, of which the shell is thin, spire short, 
and the mouth is large in proportion to the size.
I sent some to 
Mr. W.
Nelson of Leeds, and he cossiders them to be dwarfed 
forms of the var.
ovat<Sii^** ' '• 
Ir. peregra, var.
* acmninata.
I found large specimens of L.
peregra at 
Moorville and in Rickerby Beck resembling the var.
ovata, but 
having the mouth less expanded, I therefore thought they must be 
the var.
acuminata, and sent some specimens to Mr. W.
Nelson, 
who kindly examined them and confirmed my opinion.
L. glabra,'SMM\\.
Silloth.
* Ancyhxs jluviatilis, var.
albida.
Mr. Maddison informs me that this shell 
is abundant in the river Rothay, near Rydal, and he has kindly 
given me some specimens.
Zonites cellarius, var.
albida.
St. Bees.
Z. purus.
Aid. Headsnook, upon dead leaves in a ditch, associated with 
Z. crystallimis, Helix aculeata, and H.
pygrucea.
*Z.
purus, var.
margaritacea, Je£fr.
Headsnook, in a ditch, associated with 
the type form.
Z. radiatidus,lA\d.
Silloth, at the roots of grass on the sandhills.
Helix aspersa, jMnll.
This shell — though rare in the neighbourhood of 
Carlisle — abounds on St. Bees Head.
*H.
Jdspida, var.
suhrufa.
Hayton, near Carlisle.
*H.
virgata.
Da Costa.
Silloth, I found this species on the sandhills in 
21!) 
May ; it was not by any means abundant, and the shells are 
bleached and but faintly marked.
Dead shells were more numerous 
than living ones.
Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys says that this shell is found 
on sand downs and heaths in most parts of England, Wales, and 
Ireland, from Yorkshire to the Channel Isles.
The most northern 
locality given by Mr. Rinmier is Alnmouth in Northumberland 
(Mc.Murtrie), and he also states that it does not seem to have been 
found in Scotland.
It is therefore interesting to note its occurrence 
at Silloth, so near the Border.
*H.
pygmcea, Drap.
Headsnook, on dead leaves in a ditch.
H. pulcliella, Mull.
Silloth, at the roots of grass on the sandhills ; St. Bees, 
*Pupa umbilicala, var.
alba, Grassmere (Jeffreys).
I overlooked the 
notice of this shell before.
P. marginata, Drap.
Silloth ; abundant .at the roots of grass on the 
sandhills.
Vertigo pygmcea, Drap.
Near St. Bees, on the Magnesian Limestone.
Balia perversa, L.
St. Bees.
