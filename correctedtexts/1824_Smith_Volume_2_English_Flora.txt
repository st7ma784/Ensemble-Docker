Common in waste ground^ often in low muddy situations.

.August.
Akin to the last, from which it differs in being generally more bushy, 
with more deeply toothed, or sinuated, leaves, considerably elon- 
gated at the base.
The spikes are more spreading, and are be- 
set with several small leaves.
But the most distinguishing cha- 
racter, pointed out by Curtis, as well as by Ray in the variety j3, 
consists in the comparative smallness of the seeds, which in Ch.
rubrum are no bigger than grains of common sand.
In exposed 
situations the whole herb assumes a red colour.
This species 
and its allies are said to be poisonous to swine.
Botanists have 
hitherto given the name of racemi, clusters, to the inflorescence 
of these plants ; but it surely consists rather of compound spikes, 
in which the^owers are aggregate, crowded into little heads or 
tufts.

The stem is solitary, square, upright, though the lower branches

This is the Ch. pohjspermum of all Bri-

I have never

The 
seed is black, rather kidney-shaped, with a less convoluted em- 
bryo than the foregoing.
This plant is not unworthy of a place in gardens or shrubberies, 
where it is evergreen and tolerably hardy, lasting without care 
for many years.
The leaves contain some alkaline salt, and have 
an herbaceous, rather acrid, taste.

Linnaeus confounded all our Elms under his campestris.
They have since been investigated with some attention in 
England, by taking specimens at different seasons from 
the same individual tree, as has been done still more 
extensively with our Willows.
Both genera require the 
same accurate study in Scotland.
Of the species of Scottish 
Elms we have no certain knowledge.

Trunk rather crooked, with a rugged bark, and spreading, round,

Leaves about 2 inches long, and 
1 broad in the middle, doubly serrated, contracted towards each 
end ; unequal at the base, as in every known species, even the 
pvmila; dark green, and very rough to the touch, on the upper 
side j paler and smoother beneath, with a prominent midrib, 
and several transverse parallel ribs, which have each a small tuft 
of downy hairs at the origin.
R. much earlier than the foliage, 
and from inferior buds, in numerous, dense, round, dull-purple 
tufts, each flower almost sessile, with an oblong fringed bractea 
at its base.
Limb of the calyx in 4 oblong obtuse segments., of 
a light brownish red, minutely fringed.
Stam.
4, equal, with 
dark-purple anthers.
Stigtnas a downy line along the upper edge 
of each style, which line is never elongated, but becomes in- 
curved, from the great dilatation of the opposite margin, run- 
ning down into the bordered, oblong-wedgeshaped, or nearly 
obovate, flat, pale brown, somewhat shining, capsule, which has 
a deep sinus at the extremity, bordered with the styles, and ex- 
tending towards the seed.
The wood is hard and tough, particularly durable in wet situations.
That of the present species is greatly preferred in Norfolk to any 
other, and sells for nearly double the price, serving more espe- 
cially for the naves of wheels.
In other parts of England, and 
particularly about London, the more common kinds are used 
for coffins.
Mr. E.
Forster first hinted, what I have now no doubt of, that the 
above synonym of Gerarde and Ray belongs to this ; which by 
what is said in the Fl. Suec.
and tlie synonym of Dodonaeus, 
should seem to be the Swedish species, but I have no specimens 
to determine that point.

Of the value, or particular qualities, of the wood of this Elm, I

There are various cultivated varieties, raised from seed, which 
Mr. Crowe, who had closely attended to the subject, always 
traced to this species.

The branches spread widely, in a drooping manner, and their bark 
is rugged, much more corky than even the foregoing.
Leaves 
on short thick stalks, larger, and more bluntly serrated, than the

tufts, at the origin of each transverse rib, are very small.

Miller says this Elm was brought from Holland in King William's 
reign, and being recommended for its quick growth, was a 
fashionable tree for hedges in gardens, but afterwards fell into 
disuse.
He adds that " the wood is good for nothing, so it is 
almost banished this country."

Tree.
March, April.
A large spreading tree, of quicker growth than U.
cainpestris, and 
the wood is consequently far inferior in hardness and compact- 
ness, move liable to split.
The branches are, in some individuals, 
quite pendulous, like the Weeping Willow.
Their bark is even ; 
downy in a young state.
Leaves larger than any of the forego- 
ing, broadly elliptical, with a longer, copiously serrated, point j 
rough on the upper surface with minute, callous, bristly tuber- 
cles, but less harsh than most of the preceding ; the under sur- 
face downy and paler, with straight, parallel, transverse ribs, co-

piously hairy at their origins and subdivisions.
Fl. rather larger 
and paler, in looser tufts, than most of the species ; each in 5, 
6, or 7, oblong acute segments, and as many broad, rather heart- 
shaped, dark-purple anthers.
Capsule broadly obovate, or el- 
liptical and almost orbicular, with a shallow notch at the end, 
not extending half way to the seed.
Gerarde's figure represents 
the fruit well, as to this last very material character, but rather 
too narrow and elliptical in its outline.
This appears to be one of the most general species of Elm through- 
out Europe, and is certainly what the older writers distinguished 
by the epithet of montana, from our first species, their campestris.
It is sometimes called the Hertfordshire Elm, being very frequent 
and luxuriant in that county.
The large hop-like /rwi^ is abun- 
- dant, and very conspicuous, in May or June, and the seeds ap- 
pear to be usually perfected.

A tall elegant tree, with spreading, rather drooping, smooth, black- 
ish branches, scarcely downy in their earliest stage of growth.
Leaves smaller than any of the preceding, except campestris, as 
well as more oblong, strongly serrated, very unequal at the base, 
not elongated at the extremity ; their substance firm, or rather 
rigid ; the surface of both sides very smooth to the touch, nor 
are there any hairs beneath, except the axillary pubescence of 
the ribs, which often forms a narrow downy line along the mid- 
rib.
Fl. nearly sessile, with 5 short, bluntish, fringed segments, 
and as manylongish stamens, whose anthers are roundish-heart- 
shaped.
Capsule smaller than most other species, obovate, clo- 
ven dowm to the seed, smooth, often reddish.
Goodyer reports 
that the wood is preferred to that of his first species, our sube- 
rosa, for the naves of cart-wheels j but he was not acquainted 
with the superior quality of our campestris, or Norfolk Elm,

Fl. erect, 
barely an inch long, with a whitish cylindrical tube, tw-ice as 
long as the spreading, deeply 5 -cleft, acute, purplish-blue limb, 
which has no intermediate segments, but the mouth of the tube 
is crowned with a fine erect purplish fringe, rather shorter than 
the limb, and rising much above the stamens.
The calyx has a 
turbinate, 5-angled, pale-green tube, about as long as its 5 
purplish, lanceolate, acute, erect, smooth-edged segments, 
which, though uniform, are often a little unequal in size, and 
reach somewhat beyond the middle of the tube of the corolla.
The limb of the latter has occasionally but 4, or even 3, seg- 
ments, and is never fully expanded but in bright sunshine.
The 
stamens answer in number to the divisions of the cat.

being almost always 5, awl-shaped, with roundish separate 
anthers.
Styles very short.
Stigmas ovate.

dense dark-purple heads, of abortive flower-buds.
fi, found by the late Sir John Cullum, on a heath between Gran- 
tham and Ancaster, June 6, 1774, seems, by his specimens, a 
dwarf variety, which had survived the winter, nor can it by any 
specific mark be distinguished from the real Amarella ; which is 
often seen much more dwarf in autumn, bearing but 1 or 2 
Jiowers, as represented by Professor Hooker,/.

(though the latter indicates many wrong synonyms, and takes it 
for an English plant,) differs from Amarella in having Jiowers 
nearly twice as large, situated about the upper part of the stem, 
which is of a corymbose form of growth.
It may be a good spe- 
cies, but has not yet been observed in England.

His Jiowers are 4-

referred to the present species, which appears, by various Swiss

[I have now first attempted to arrange and characterize the 
genera of this Natural Order, by the parts of fructification 
alone, according to the wise principles taught by Linnaeus; 
but against which he himself, in this instance, transgressed.
To understand this arrangement, of which the technical 
characters are to be found at the head of the present order, 
Peiitandria Digynia, it is necessary to give a detailed ac- 
count of the parts in question.
Calyx superior, of 5, more or less unequal, leaves, or teeth, 
permanent, and somewhat enlarged, after floweruig, fre- 
quently obsolete in the flower ; and sometimes a mere rim, 
either entire or notched ; sometimes altogether wanting.
Corolla of 5 petals, deciduous, equal, or mostly unequal ; 
each petal either inversely heart-shaped, with an inflexed 
point between the lobes, which are sometimes unequal ; 
or roundish, or elliptic-oblong, straight or inflexed, and 
undivided; the whole petal in some cases involute, or 
rolled in upon itself, as is seen in Bupleurum.
PENTANDRIA— DIGYNIA.
Umbellate.
S3 
Stam.
Filaments 5, equal or unequal, according as the petals 
are so, thread-shaped or awl-sliaped, simple, spreading.
Anthers roundish or oblong, incumbent, of 2 close pa- 
rallel lobes, without any appendage, and 2 cells opening 
lengthwise.
Pistil.
Germen inferior, usually simple, rarely a double 
globe ; more or less compressed, eitiier laterally or trans- 
versely ; the surface either even, or striated longitudinally, 
smooth, hairy, or prickly.
Styles 2, each proceeding from 
the inner side of a large, tumid, ovate, globular, pyrami- 
dal, or depressed, permanent base, of a glandular ap- 
pearance, very seldom wanting ; the styles themselves are 
usually cylindrical, short and erect in the flower, but sub- 
sequently elongated, either spreading or strongly reflexed, 
forming a pair of hooks to the fi-uit ; in a few genei'a they 
are at every period long and capillary, in some degree 
spreading, almost invariably permanent, and hardened as 
the fruit ripens.
Stigmas either simple, obtuse, or capi- 
tate, never divided.
Floral Receptacle, or DisJc, a glandular ring, under the 
tumid bases of the styles, and mostly united therewith, 
but differing in substance, and often in duration, some- 
times dilated into a thin undulated margin or ruffle, in 
general somewhat enlarged as the fruit ripens, sometimes 
withering, sometimes entirely wanting, finally separated 
into two pai'ts, one of which aecompanies each seed.
Fruit either ovate, roundish, elliptical, cj'lindrical, or ob- 
long, tumid and solid, or thin and chaffy; compressed 
more or less, either laterally, that is, contrary to the por- 
tions of the Jloral receptacle ; or transversely, parallel 
thereto ; and finally separating into 2 naked seeds, each 
suspended by one branch of a capillary, upright, divided 
receptacle.
Seeds each of the shape of half the fruit ; their outer skin 
various in substance, form, and surface, giving the cha- 
racter o^\X\& fruit ; the inner thin, membranous and uni- 
form; each seed crowned with one half of the jf?o?-a/ recep- 
tacle, as well as with a part of the calyx, if either or both 
be present, and usually with one of the slijles ; i\\Q\v junc- 
ture, or point of union, flat, or finally concave, various in 
breadth in those which are compressed laterally ; nearly 
as broad as the seeds in tliose which are compressed 
transversely; their ma7-gins either simple, or bordered 
with a membranous wing; their outer surface more or

sometimes prickly, or scaly.
Alhtmen large, fleshy, com-

Embryo dicotyledonous, in-

Inflorescence (except in Eryngium) a simple, or more usually 
compound, umbel, of many rays, with or widiout several 
bracteas at the origin of the several rays.
The absence 
or presence of these bracteas, and in some cases their 
shape, is resorted to by Linnasus for generic characters ; 
to excuse which he denominates them involucra and ivi- 
volucella, as being supposed a kind oi calyx, remote from 
ihejlo'iioer.
But they are found in practice to lead to tlie 
formation of unnatural genera, and to be variable in the 
same species ; affording an example of the treacherous 
nature of every thing belonging to the injtorescence, and 
not to \h^ fructification, for generic discrimination.
Umbelliferous Plants are generally herbaceous, with leaves 
for the most part repeatedly compound.
Flowers wliite, 
reddish, or yellow.
Such as grow in dry or mountainous 
places are aromatic and wholesome; the marsh or aquatic 
knids are virulent and dangerous.!

Leaves light green, triply pinnatifid, with linear, acute, 
smooth segments.
Foot:ilalks dilated at the base, with mem- 
branous hairy edges.
Umbels small, mostly terminal, stalked, 
in pairs, here and there solitary ; with very short rays, over- 
topped by the broad, cloven or jagged, white-edged bracteas.
Fl. in some degree radiant, especially those of the circumfei-ence, 
which alone ripen seed, the innermost having no perfect germew*.
Petals undivided, elliptic-lanceolate, acute, inflexed.
Frwi^ be- 
set with a few close bristles ; the beak, which is li or 2 inches 
long, much more rough, especially at the edges, and crowned 
witli the purplish, enlarged, 5-cIeft receptacle of the flower, over- 
topped by the straight upright styles.
This is sometimes a troublesome weed, to which, though slightly 
aromatic and acrid, no particular use is attributed.
Dioscorides, 
indeed, mentions it as eatable ; but his XyMvSt^ may not be

Perennial.
April, May.
Root spindle-shaped, a little milky.
Stem about a y^ird high, 
branched, leafy, round, striated, hollow, somewhat swelled be- 
low the joints, especially when full grown ; the lower part downv ; 
upper sleek, and generally devoid of pubescence.
Leaves triply 
pinnate; leaflets ovate, pinnatifid, rough-edged.
Umbels smooth ; 
the partial ones drooping more or less when young ; quite erect 
when in full bloom, with about 5 ovate, membranous, densely 
fringed, deflexed bracteas to each.
Petals unequal in the mar- 
ginal flowers, which alone are prolific.
Fr. lanceolate, with a 
deep channel at each side, blackish, polished, quite smooth and 
even, with a short, angular, furrowed beak.
Bases of the styles 
almost globular, seated on a scarcely discernible floral recep- 
tacle.
The whole herb, having the flavour of carrots, is eaten by domestic 
cattle, and is reported to be very grateful to rabbits.
The snow- 
white j?oioers, some of the earliest of their tribe, plentifully adorn

Leaves 
on narrow-winged footstalks, large, twice ternate : leaflets 
stalked, ovate, or elhptic-oblong, acute, copiously, sharply, and 
rather finely serrated, with an occasional notch on one side at 
the base ; their length 1 ^ or 2 inches ; both sides nearly smooth j 
the serratures minutely fringed.
Umbels of many smooth, slen-

Bulbocastanum of Tournefort must be the type of this genus, 
whatever may become of the two Greek species, or any 
others, that have been added to it ; neither can I concur 
with the learned Professor Sprengel, who cites Gouan 
erroneously, in reducing Bulbocastanum minus to Sium, 
and B.
majus to Myrrhis.
They cannot but be consi-

Gouan has well distinguished the two species, though 
he has strangely perverted their synonyms, and seems to have 
misled Sprengel.
If this should ever be found in Britain, the shorter, more abrupt 
fruity and reflexed stijles, will infallibly ascertain it.

Perennial.
Jttiij, August.
Root fleshy, with numerous long fibres, creeping.
Stents from 3 
to 6 feet high, erect, angular and deeply furrowed, leafy, hollow, 
.smooth, very little branched.
Leaves from 6 to 1 2 inches in 
- length, oblong, smooth, for the most part simply pinnate, with 
about 5 or 6 pair of large, opposite, lanceolate, acute leaflets, 
with an odd one, all copiously, sharply and regularly serrated j 
those leaflets only which grow under water being often doubly 
pinnatifid, with very narrow segments.
Footstalks of the 
lower leaves long, cylindrical, hollow, and striated j the rest 
very short ; all clasping the stem with a dilated membranous 
margin.
Umbels terminal or axillary, stalked, solitary, erect, 
large, nearly flat, of numerous, smooth, general and partial 
rays.
Bracteas several general as well as partial, lanceolate, 
taper-pointed, ribbed, with white membranous edges.
Fl. nu- 
merous, snow-white, small, the outermost a little irregular.
Cnl. of acute, rather unequal leaves.
JViui elliptic-ovate, small.
Styles permanent, reflexed, slightly tumid at the base.
Each 
seed is semi-elliptical, with 5 pale, stout, rounded, prominent 
ribs J the deep intermediate spaces striated.
One of the seeds 
is often abortive, and the other is then much incurved.
Their 
flavour is aromatic, and less acrid than the rest of the plant j 
which like all the tribe, when in growing water, partakes of a 
poisonous quality.
Surely the habit and characters of this plant are very remote from 
Coriandrum.

1 have been anxious to preserve the natural genus of Sison, which 
Linnaeus had the skill to detect, and, according to his principles, 
to define.
The fructification accurately examined will, I trust, 
suffice to distinguish it ; if not, the first species must be removed 
to Sium, where many authors have placed it, and with the se 
cond species of which, angustifoUum, its fruit too nearly accords 
unless that species should be made a Sison, which is not advisa- 
ble.
In either case Sison segetum must remain ; and, if I mis- 
take not, the exotic S.

mediate ribs.

Seeds flattened at the sides ; convex at the 
back, and marked with 3 prominent double ribsj which aftbrd an 
excellent generic character hitherto unnoticed.
The habit in- 
deed, and the ternate leaves, which forbid our reducing this plant 
to Sium, might well lead us to expect some essential mark of 
difference in the fructification.
I have not seen the fruit of C.
7na- 
culata, nor of C.
bulbifera.
C. virosa is a very fatal plant to horned cattle, if they happen to 
meet with it before it rises out of the water, in which state only 
they will eat the young leaves.
The whole herb is reported to 
be poisonous also to other quadrupeds, as well as to mankind, 
producing sudden inflammation in the stomach.

The few long pendulous bracteas, under each

Dr. Bigelow of 
Boston in New England observed this Mthusa to be without 
scent in America ; but seeds transmitted by him produced plants 
with the same nauseous garlick flavour as those of Great Britain.
Some curious facts of a similar nature have been observed.
The 
flowers of Hesperis matronaUs, as I have heard, lose their scent 
in America after the first generation.

Root tap-shaped, whitish, fleshy.
Stem from 3 to 5 feet high, erect, 
round, hollow, glaucous, polished, copiously spotted with pur- 
ple ; remaining long bleaching in the hedges through the au- 
tumnal months.
Leaves large and repeatedly compound j leaf- 
lets ovate, closely and sharply pinnatifid, of a deep shining green, 
and not unhandsome j on long furrowed footstalks, sheathing at 
the base.
Umbels terminal, very numerous, erect, compound, 
occasionally attended by 1 or 2 simple axillary ones, as in Engl.

General Bracteas with mem- 
branous edges.
Fl. numerous, white, all prolific ; the outer- 
most very slightly irregular.
Fruit abundant, at all periods of 
growth sufficiently crisped, in some part or other, to show the 
generic character.
The herbage is fetid, narcotic and sedative, much used, in the form 
of an extract, for lowering the pulse in acute inflammatory dis- 
orders ; and still more celebrated for relieving scrofulous and 
cancerous maladies.
Haller has collected every thing that has 
been said on this subject, as to the external as well as internal 
application of Hemlock.
Those who are interested, should be 
careful to have the right plant; and not, as is frequently the case, 
some inactive, or perhaps too potent and dangerous, herb of the 
same tribe, in its stead.

General Bracteas almost entirely want-

Recent plant, when 
bruised, odiously fetid, in every part, though the ripe 
seeds, in our British species, are agreeably aromatic, and 
not unwholesome.
The exotic one differs so widely in 
its fruit, which is a double globe, that nodiing can be 
more difficult than to include both species in one descrip- - 
tion, or definition, of that part.
Yet nothing ought to 
separate generically plants so closely and peculiarly allied 
in every other particular.
The bracteas vary.
T\\e corolla 
is radiant in both, though Linnaeus reports otherwise.

Root spindle-shaped, thick, with many whorled fibres.
Stem 2 or 3 
feet high, hollow, stout, furrowed, half immersed in the water, very 
bushy, with numerous, spreading, leafy branches.
Leaves stalked, 
spreading, repeatedly pinnate, cut, with innumerable, fine, ex- 
panded, dark-green, shining, acute segments.
Umbels opposite 
to the leaves, on shortish tumid stalks, many-rayed, without 
any general bracteas.
Partial umbels very dense, of numerous 
short rays, accompanied by many narrwv, taper-pointed brac- 
teas.
Fl. white, numerous } the outer ones largest, and most 
irregular ; the innermost more certainly prolific.
Fr. ovate, ra- 
ther compressed, purplish, very smooth, crowned with the 
spreading calyx, and rather short, permanent, slightly spread- 
ing, styles.
Each seed has 5 broad, tumid, scarcely corky ribs, 
separated by narrow furrows, and agrees better with the usual 
character of CEnanthe than the last species, which nevertheless 
cannot be separated from the rest.
Pr. Roth always writes the old name Phelandrium ; which agi-ees 
with an etymology 1 have hazarded in Rees's Cyclopaedia, v.
27, 
from <pri\£tv, to be treacherous, alluding to the poisonous nature 
of the plant.
^ryXAcij, cork, is not at all satisfactory.

Our British Crithmum, together with Cachrys Libanotis of 
Linnaeus, which is unquestionably of the same genus, 
constitutes the 2d section of Professor Sprengel's Cachrys.
I think they are best kept separate, whatever may become 
oi Cachrys sicula, Linn, figured in Fl, Grcsc.
t. 278, which 
is nearly allied to them in genus, but \hQJlonxers are yel- 
low, an important circumstance as to habit, and the seeds 
have very remarkably toothed wings.
This fine plant 
ought perhaps to form a genus.
The corky, smooth, 
turgid frtdt of a real Cachrys is essentially different from 
it, as well as from our Crithmum ,- and I believe other 
marks of distinction will be found in the Jlowers.
The 
styles are long and slender, with a broad depressed base; 
the calyx scarcely any ; many of the^owers imperfect, or 
abortive.
The woolly seeds of some ought not, perhaps, 
to cause a generic separation ; but I do not presume here 
to decide this point, which does not concern the British 
Flora.

The herb makes an old-fashioned English pickle, as those know 
who read Shakspeare's King Lear^ and it is sold in the London 
shops ; but there are many plants generally preferred for the 
same puqiose.

Celery, the former has numerous narrow imrtial bracteas,

This is a great ob-

to divide the genus on account of them.

Umbels terminal and lateral ; frequently almost sessile, 
accompanied by 1 or 2 ternate leaves; their general rays un-

Fruit 
almost orbicular, with permanent, wide-spreading, not reflexed,

The seeds, and whole plant, in its native ditches, are acrid, and

By culture 
it becomes the mild and grateful Garden Celery, for which, and 
its name, we are indebted to the Italians, and which has now 
supplanted our native Alexanders, Smyrnium Olusatrum.
A. Petroselinum appears to have no claim to a place in a British

The whole habit of this plant, with its broad ternate, not pinnate,

Haller says it

Perennial.
Jitne.
Root fleshy, tuberous, somewhat creeping, of an aromatic and acrid 
quality, long supposed a sovereign counter-poison, and cele- 
brated as a powerful external, as well as internal, remedy, in 
numerous disorders.
Stem 1 to 2 feet high, erect, hollow, round, 
striated, smooth, leafy, slightly branched.
Lower leaves on long 
stalks, twice ternate ; upper less compound, on shorter stalks, 
with a sheathing, membranous, sometimes jagged, dilatation at 
the base.
Leajlets 2 or 3 inches long, and broad in proportion, 
veiny, smooth on both sides, rough-edged, finely and sharply ser- 
rated, partly cut or lobed, the middle one, sometimes all three, 
deeply three-cleft ; the uppermost often very narrow.
Umbels 
broad, flattish, of about 40 smooth general rays, 8 or 1 inches 
wide when in seed ; the partial rays still more numerous.
Fl.
small, white, or pale flesh-coloured, almost perfectly uniform 
and regular.
Sprengel has referred 5 new species to this genus, which originally 
consisted of but one ; and nevertheless he makes the want of 
general bracteas the only difference between Imperatoria and -S'e- 
linum.
Of these 5 plants, Selinum Chabrcei is, like other true 
species of Selinum, so widely different in its pinnate, very nar- 
row, leaves, short styles, floral receptacle, and ribs of the seed, 
from Imperatoria, that no good principles can bring them to- 
gether.
Selinum caucasicum I know nothing of 3 nor have I 
seen Imperatoria angustifolia of Bellardi.
Angelica lucida and 
verticillaris of Linnaeus do indeed appear to be justly removed by 
Professor Sprengel to Imperatoria, and I have therefore given 
to our British species a discriminating specific character.
The 
great breadth of the wings in Imperatoria, each of which is at 
least as broad as the disk or body of the seed ,• the deep sinus at 
the base j and the ribs being not bordered or winged, distin- 
guish this genus from Angelica.

Root spindle-shaped, contracted at the crown, descending to a

juice.
Stem 2 or 3 feet high, solitary, erect, branched, round, 
striated, roughish, purple at the base, slightly leafy.
Leaves 
deep green ; the radical ones on long, purplish, angular, rough- 
ish footstalks, twice or thrice pinnate, broader than they are 
long ; leajlets wedge-shaped, sharply cut, rough at the nerves 
and margin with minute, depressed, bristly points.
Stem-leaves 
(mistaken by Linnaeus, in Dillenius's figure, for radical ones)

Styles tumid, and almost globular, at the

Stigmas bluntish.
Fruit, which I have not seen quite 
ripe, solid, ovate, a little compressed, abrupt, crowned with the 
whitish calyx, and spreading styles, and having .5 stout, promi- 
nent, equal ribs, with deep intermediate furrows, to each seed.
Juncture apparently very narrow.
Seeds ovate, flattened at the 
inner side ; externally convex.
All the Jlowers appear to be per- 
fect and prolific.
This rare plant, which remained, for half a century after its first 
discovery, entirely unobserved, has been confidently asserted to 
be the identical Danaa of AUioni, Physospermum of Cusson and 
of Sprengel, Prodr.
19.
The herbage of the two plants is in- 
deed so very similar, that it is hardly possible to believe them 
generically distinct.
Physospermum however has separated 
Jlowers, the barren ones most numerous, and is essentially cha- 
racterized, as the excellent name imports, by having a loose, 
. bladdery, inflated skin to the seeds ; the fruit being, in every 
stage of growth, a double globe, smooth, polished, at length ac- 
quiring slightly prominent ribs, and being crowned with the 
strongly recurved styles.
The seeds within are solid, nearly hemi- 
spherical, irregularly furrowed.
Of this genus there are 2 spe- 
cies, 1st Ph. nquih'gifoUum, which is Allinni's Danaa; Laser-

This plant, concerning whose genus botanists have been so various 
and uncertain, was thought by Tournefort very nearly akin to 
his Fceniculum, which comprises, among many other things, our 
common, or sweet.

The presence of bracteas forms the 
chief objection, as to habit 5 but this is rather an instance of 
their uncertainty for a generic character.

Herbage extremely vari- 
able in luxuriance.
Stem from 1 to 2 or 3 feet high, firm, erect, 
angular and deeply furrowed, solid, smooth, leafy principally in 
the lower part.
Radical leaves stalked, twice or thrice pinnate, 
in foreign specimens still more compound j lecifiets opposite, 
deeply and sharply cut, smooth   the lowermost crowded, and 
often crossing each other.
Umbels terminal, on long, upright, 
furrowed stalks, convex, of many stout, angular, downy general 
rays, and still more numerous partial ones.
Bracteas both ge- 
neral and partial numerous, linear-lanceolate, taper-pointed, 
downy.
Fl. crowded, white or reddish.
The styles and their 
tumid bases assume a violet hue after the flowers are past.
The 
umbels are sometimes proliferous.
Whether the hairiness of the 
fruit be an essential character or not, this plant cannot belong 
to Ligusticum, as the ribs of that part are not winged.

Root spindle-shaped.
Herb smooth, dark green.
Stem erect, 
branched, leafy, round, furrowed, solid, tough, from 1 to 2 feet 
high.
Leaves doubly pinnate ; leajlets elliptic-lanceolate, mi- 
nutely pointed, entire ; either undivided, or separated, almost 
to the base, into 2 or 3 segments, of the same shape and mag- 
nitude.
Umbels on long stalks, erect, of several unequal general 
rays, those of the partial umbels much more numerous.
General 
bracteas white-edged, linear, 1 or 2, rarely 3, most frequently 
none at all ; when present, lasting, not deciduous ; partial ones 
several, of the same shape, equal to the partial rays.
H. yel- 
lowish or greenish-white, with a thin Jioral receptacle, at first 
green and erect, but as the fruit advances, spreading, depressed, 
confluent with the broad convex bases of the styles, and assum- 
ing their reddish colour.
Fruit roundish-ovate.
The whole plant, being fetid when bruised, is supposed in some 
parts of Norfolk to give a bad flavour to milk and butter ; but 
cattle certainly do not eat it ; except accidentally, or in small 
quantities, sufficient perhaps to have the effect in question.
Where this herb abounds in pastures, it may be found partially 
cropped, though generally left almost entire.
Peucedanum alsaticum of Linnaeus, having a calyx, and a flattened 
bordered fruit, is really of that genus, and no Cnidium, though 
resembling our present species in habit.

somewhat spatulate.
Umbels lateral and terminal, erect, on 
spreading stalks.
Gejieral bracteas lanceolate, with 5 ribs, of 
which the lateral ones are close together ; partial bracteas 
ovate, with usually 3 ribs, sometimes accompanied by 2 more,

Flowers cream-coloured, with a tinge of red.

Like the rest of its genus, this herb is astringent, with some bit- 
terness.
Gaertner's incorrect figure, if his plant be ours, seems to have 
misled Professor Sprengel to describe the fruit as destitute of 
ribs.
It appears very improbable that this should be Pliny's 
Odontites, with the description of which it does not agree.

rizontal, nearly orbicular, doubly crenate, smooth, light green, 
with 8 or 9 branching ribs, radiating from the centre, and a 
notch, more or less deep, at the base Flower-stalks axillary, 
1 or more accompanying each group of leaves, shorter than the 
footstalks, with a pair of broad bracieas at the base.
Umbel very 
small, its rays so short as to be scarcely observable, usually 
about 5, with 3 or 4 thin lanceolate bracteas at their base.
Fl.
small, white or reddish.
Fruit somewhat wrinkled, compressed, 
like all the preceding, laterally, that is, contrary to the ^wnc/Mre,- 
and not much more so than several of the foregoing genera or 
species.
This herb is acrid, and probably, like others of the umbelliferous 
tribe, growing in wet places, poisonous.
But whether it causes 
the rot in sheep, and indeed whether those animals ever touch 
it, is doubtful.
Too moist a pasture is known to produce that 
disease, and there the Hydrocotyle is generally to be found.

Selinum.
Root, vvitli us, tapering, simple, with many long fibres.
Sterii so- 
litary, erect, 4 or 5 feet high, hollow, deeply furrowed, not 
hairy; branched and corymbose in the upper part; bright purple 
at the base.
Leaves about 5 or 6 on the stem, alternate, remote, 
twice or thrice pinnate ; leaflets opposite, deeply pinnatifid, dark 
green, smooth, their segments elliptic-lanceolate, never quite 
linear, rather acute, slightly deeurrent, entire ; the terminal 
ones longest.
Footstalks branched, striated, smooth; dilated 
and sheathing at the base, with a reddish membranous margin.
Umbels large, horizontal, of numerous,, rough, angular, general 
and partial rays.
General hraclcas several, lanceolate, pointed, 
dependent, not half the length of the rays, their margins mem- 
branous, and partly coloured ; partial ones similar, rather longer 
in proportion.
Fl. white, numerous, uniform, with involute 
petals.
Seeds elliptical, light brown, paler at the edges ; their 
ribs broad, obtuse, with narrow linear interstices.
There are 
several barren or ahortiveflowers in each partial umbel.
The root serves the Russians for Ginger ; and the whole herb 
abounds with a white, bitter, fetid juice, of the consistence of 
cream, which soon dries to a brownish acrid resin.
This milky 
exudation is the only character by which Tournefort distinguishes 
his Thijsselinuni from his ()reoseHniun.
The ingenious Sprengel 
has, more scientifically, endeavoured to found a generic differ- 
ence on the broader ribs, and somewhat thicker coat, of the seeds, 
compared with other species of Selinum.
But I think these cha- 
racters are scarcely discernible, and by no means sufficient to au- 
thorize a division of so natural a genus.
The tnie name in 
Pliny is, moreover, Thijsselium, which most authors, except tlie 
learned Rivinus, have negligently corrupted ; but which must be 
restored, if it were wanted, to avoid clashing with Selinum, See 
Philosophia Botanica, sect.
225.
There appear to be two varieties of Selinum pahtstre, one of which, 
well represented by Dalechamp, is here described ; and the other, 
with more numerous roots and stems, as figured in Dodonaeus, 
Gerarde, Lobel and Morison, is often taken for the Linnsean 
sylvestre.
Professor Sprengel has, with great accuracy and 
judgement, proved them one and the same species.
But the 
S. sylvestre of Linnseus, cultivated at Upsal, and preserved in his 
herbarium, is really distinct, having still more compound leaves, 
whose leci/Iets have perfectly linear and very narrow segments, 
running down into a winged mid-rib, and the aspect of the whole 
leaf, as well as its paler liue, is remarkable.
Of this I can dis- 
cover no synonyms.
Haller's no.
800, Thysselium of Rivinus, 
t. 19, always mistaken for .S. sylvestre, proves by Reynier's her- 
barium, and Haller's description, totally distinct from both these 
Linnaean species, having a bristly stem, and leaves much less 
compound, v.'ith far broader segments, than either.
No wonder 
that the Swiss botanists have always been in uncertainty respect- 
ing these plants, as appe:iis from Mr. Davall's notes.

Root tap-shaped, whitish, aromatic, sweetish and rather mucilagi-

Stem 4 feet high, erect, branched, leafy, furrowed, rough

Leases large, ternate or pinnate; 
leaflets usually broad, rather heart-shaped, lobed, serrated, veiny, 
hairy, paler beneath ; varying occasionally very much in breadth, 
and in the variety /3, which that excellent observer the late Mr.
Woodward found growing on the same root with the common 
kind, deeply pinnatifid, the 2 lowest lobes elongated and spread- 
ing in a radiating manner, as delineated by Jacquin and Pluke- 
net.
Footstalks hairy ; dilated, ribbed, concave, and sheathing, 
at the base.
Umbels flattish, of many angular rays, which are 
downy at one side, like the more numerous partial rays.
Brac- 
teas lanceolate, membranous, finely fringed, with long taper 
points, the general ones few, soon falling off, or altogether want-

Fl. more or less conspicuously radiant, white, or reddish ; 
many, in the central portion of each partial umbel, barren, with 
no traces of a germen.
Fruit abundant, light brown, with 4 
purplish-brown lines at each side.
The whole plant is wholesome and nourishing food for cattle ; and 
is gathered in Sussex for fattening hogs, being known by the 
name of Hog- weed, as I have learned from Sir Thomas Frank- 
land.
Two very able botanists having compared a Yorkshire narrow- 
leaved specimen, with one from Sweden of the true Linnsean 
H. angustifolium, they assured me of its being indubitably the 
same.
Hence I admitted //.
angustifolium into the Flora Bri- 
tannica, with a description made from the plant in the Linnsean 
herbarium, which is clearly a distinct species ; but on seeing the 
Yorkshire specimen, I at once perceived the mistake, which is 
corrected in Engl.
Bot. Jacquin's angustifolium is doubtless our 
variety, whatever his longifolium, FL Austr.

Our ancestors evinced a just hatred of their brutal enemies the 
Danes, in supposing the nauseous, fetid and noxious plant be- 
fore us to have sprung from their blood.
Its qualities are vio-

said to have been taken with safety, as far as an ounce.

In hedges, coppices, and woods, common ; the varieties rare, ex- 
cept in gardens.
A small tree, June.
Stem much and irregularly, though always oppositely, branched, 
of quick growth ; branches, after a year's growth, clothed with 
smooth grey bark, and filled with a light spongy pith.
Leaflets 
deep green, smooth, usually 2 pair, with an odd one.
Cymes 
large, smooth, of numerous cream-coloured^oM;ers,with a sweet, 
but faint smell ; some in each cyme sessile.
Berries globular, 
purplish-black ; their stalks reddish.
It may be observed that our uncertain summer is established by the 
time the Elder is in full flower, and entirely gone when its berries 
are ripe.
These berries make a useful and agreeable rob, of a 
slightly purgative quality, and very good for catarrhs, sore

throats, &c.
The inner bark is more actively catliartic, and is 
thought beneficial, in rustic ointments and cataplasms, for burns.
The dried flowers serve for fomentations, and make a fragrant 
but debilitating tea, useful perhaps in acute inflammations, but 
not to be persisted in habitually.
An infusion of the leaves proves 
fatal to the various insects which thrive on bliglited or delicate 
plants, nor do many of this tribe, in the caterpillar state, feed 
upon tliem.
Cattle scarcely touch them, and the mole is driven 
away by their scent.
Both the varieties above marked have usually whitish berries, of a 
less disagreeable flavour than the recent black ones ; but tlie 
latter are best for medical use.
A wine is often made of them, 
to be taken warm, with spices and sugar ; and they are said 
frequently to enter into the composition of a less innocent be- 
verage, artificial or adulterated Port.

acute, finely serrated.
Stipulas general and partial, awl-shap-

This genus seems allied on the one hand to Saxifraga, 
on the other to Geranmm, though without any great tech-

It necessarily becomes the 
type of a new ordei', which has nothing to do with the 
Capparides.

Leaves 
numerous, depressed, orbicular, more or less obtuse, concave, 
purplish, about I an inch broad, each tapering into a flat foot- 
stallc.
The whole disk of the leaf, but especially its margin, is 
beset with red inflexed hairs, discharging from their ends a drop 
of viscid acrid fluid.
These hairs have been thought irritable, 
so as to contract when touched, imprisoning insects somewhat 
in the manner of the American Dioncsa Muscipula, a plant allied 
to Drosera.
Fl. several, in a simple cluster, drooping or revo- 
lute while young, on one or two simple, round, erect, smooth 
stalks, 3 or 4 inches high.
Bracteas solitary under each partial 
stalk, awl-shaped, deciduous.
Petals white, always 5, as well, 
as the stamens.
The whole plant, except the red hairs of the leaves, turns blackish 
in drying.
Dr. Williams, Professor of Botany at Oxford, as vv-ell 
as the late Dr. Withering, observed this, and the following, oc- 
casionally to acquire a stem.

Rather larger and taller than the foregoing, and distinguished by 
its nearly erect, obovate leaves, whose footstalks, as Dr. Hull 
first remarked, are smooth and naked, not fringed with glandu- 
lar hairs, though the disk and edges of the leaves agree in that 
particular with the former.
The Jlowers, as well as their mode 
of growth, are similar ; but Dr. Hidl and Mr. Sowerby found 
the styles often varying from 6 to 8.

The linear-oblong shape of the leaves, not correctly 
expressed in the older figures, appears to be the most constant 
character of D.
anglica ; yet some opportunities of examining 
these two plants have made me more and more doubtful of their 
permanent distinction.

So common in gardens, that it is supposed to have escaped from

Ray and

the question how far they were right or wrong can scarcely be 
determined, and the late Mr. Robson's opinion is one of the most 
weighty against them.

Perennial.
August.
Bulbs white, globose, increasing rapidly in a garden, by lateral off- 
sets, till they compose a mass as big as a man's head, resem- 
bling a bunch of grapes ; whence, I have sometimes thought, 
the old Greek name of the plant, Ampeloprasum, Vine Garlick, 
might have originated ; but a name of similar construction has 
been applied to several species from their growing in vineyards.
In this lu.\uriant condition it rarely produces^oti'ers.
Otherwise 
the stems are solitaiy from each bulb, 2 or 3 feet high, erect, 
round, solid, simple ; leafy in the lower part.
Leaves alternate, 
flaccid, flat, linear, near an inch broad, taper-pointed, slightly 
keeled, single-ribbed ; sheathing at the base ; rough with mi- 
nute teeth at the edges, and at the top of the keel.
Stipula 
membranous, tubular, undivided, within the sheath of each leaf.
Umbel solitary, erect, of innumerable light-purple Jloivers, on 
angular stalks, with a large, concave, deciduous bractea, includ- 
ing many small interior ones.
Fl. uniform, not large, unac- 
companied by bulbs.

Stam.

Germen py-

The scent of the whole plant is 
strong, and of the most disagreeable kind.

Umbel rather

Every part of the plant when trodden upon, or otherwise bruised, 
exhales the strong odour of its genus ; and if cows feed upon it,

so that even the pretty flowers are seen with disgust, by those 
who wish in vain to eradicate such a nuisance fi-om their pastures.
Pliny, who first has recorded the specific name, does not account 
for its application.
The coarseness of its qualities, like the man- 
ners of some human beings, may, in both cases, justify the com- 
parison.

Linnaeus and Haller thought this plant had escaped from gardens 
in Sweden and Switzerland ; and such has been the opinion of 
many botanists in England.
It is however perfectly wild at 
present, and extremely abundant in many old chalk-pits, though 
the bulbs run so far into the ground that they rarely flower.
Nothing can be more distinct as a species.
Mr. Ker, late Gawler, 
observes that the bulbs send out lateral shoots, of a considerable 
length, forming new bulbs at the extremity.

Petals of a brilliant enamelled white on the

Linnaeus first gave 
the above etymology, in his Prcelectiones, published by Giseke, 
p. 287.
He has also shown that the roots of this plant, eaten 
to the present day in Palaestine, are the " Dove's Dung" men-

Bulb globular, with a brownish coat.
Leaves numerous, spreading, 
for the most part quite linear, channelled, deep green, smooth.
Stalk 1, rarely 2, about 3 inches high, round, terminating in an 
oblong cluster of several little, rose-coloured, scentless Jlowers, 
whose stamens are of a deeper red, and the pistil light blue.
The partial stalks become curved upwards, or inwards, as the 
fruit ripens, and are destitute of bracteas.
H. autumnalis major of the old authors, generally exhibited along 
with this, has 2 Jlower-stalks, but is not worth noticing even as 
fruit a variety.

, merous, of a shining, pale, slightly glaucous, green, linear, point- 
ed, channelled, keeled, flaccid ; upright in their lower half, then 
reflexed and drooping.
Stalk taller than the foliage, round, cen- 
tral.
Cluster partly upright, drooping in the upper half, of many 
pendulous, blue, sv/eet-scentedjlowers, each nearly an inch long.
Bracteas lanceolate, tapering, in pairs, unequal, longer than the

Style about the same length, deciduous, 
except the very base.
Stigma abrupt.
The most decisive cha- 
racter of Hyacinthus, a monopetalous corolla, to say nothing of 
the nectariferous pores, is wanting in this plant ; and whoever 
attends to natural genera, without which there can be no idea 
of natural orders, must perceive its agreement with every cha- 
racter and indication of Scilla.
So closely is it allied to S.
cam- 
panulata of Banks and Solander, Willd.
v. 2.
128, that few per- 
fectly distinct species of any natural genus can better exemplify 
such a genus.
Hence it is no less clearly associated with other 
Scillce.
Jussieu has proposed removing it from Hyacinthus, 
though he, from theory, considers the corolla as merely divided 
into 6 deep segments.
The slightest examination will prove it 
of 6 petals, as distinct as in almost any flower whatever.

is reported to have been made of these roots, in the north of 
Europe.
The stem is 12 or 18 inches high, angular, or some- 
what two-edged, wavy, leafy, a little curved at the upper part.
Leaves broadly elliptical, acute, ribbed, plaited ; clasping, and 
more or less tapering, at the base.
Stalks axillary, drooping, 
bearing I, rarely 2, pendulous, conical, green and white^owers, 
smelling powerfully like Hawthorn, or even Heliotropium peru-

A variety with

We are obliged to Professor Hooker for pointing out the smooth

Spadix about a foot above the root, a little spread-

numerous, thick-set, pale green flowers, which have no scent, 
except when bruised.
A very narrow wavy membrane may be 
observed at the base of the spadix, which perhaps ought to be 
taken into the generic character as a spafha.
The flowers are rare.
The dried root powdered is used, by the 
country people in Norfolk, for curing the ague.
On the A4ayor's 
day, in June, the cathedral of Norwich, and some of the streets, 
have from time immemorial been strewed, or decorated, with 
this plant, which, when trodden upon, smells somewhat like 
myrtle ; b\it having become less plentiful, its place is now 
partly supplied by Iris Fseud-ucorus, or the larger kinds of Carex.

Panicle compound, and

top of each stem, corymbose, many- flowered 5 its branches

I readily concur with Mr. Bicheno in considering the inflorescence 
as lateral in all this tribe of Jimci ; which is justified by analogy, 
though it may seem paradoxical, in this species and the next.
Nor is the question without difficulty, as all who ever thought 
on the subject have long ago perceived.

Mr. Bicheno has adopted my suggestion in Engl.

Many synonyms and figures of early authors, quoted by Linnaeus 
for his J.

belong to our glaucus ; but they give a wrong idea of its posi-

I most heartily concur with Mr. Bicheno in freeing our nomencla-

!4, by Haller, 
in their synonyms at least, and hitherto perhaps by all botanists.
Gmelin's figure, Fl. Sib.
t. \7.f. 2, cited by Wahlenberg for his 
hottnicus, is so very bad as to be unintelligible, nor can 1 quite 
satisfy myself respecting this last-mentioned species, by a single 
Nuremberg specimen from Dr. Panzer, which is all 1 have seen.
The very suitable name of comprensus is authorized by an early 
work of Jacquin, his Enumerutio, or Catalogue of the plants 
about Vienna, published in 1762, with observations upon the 
rarer species at the end.
Willdenow has misled Mr. Bicheno 
to quote this publication by another title, Jacq.
Obs., under 
J. trifidus, which mav cause a mistake, Jacquin's Observationes 
being a very different and more common book.

In salt marshes, and muddy places towards the sea, abundantly.
Differs from the last in the darker colour of the whole plant, but 
especially of the flowers and capsule.
The stem is more leafy, 
and in the upper part rather triangular than compressed.
Leaves 
more rigid, and externally striated.
Panicle less compound, not 
overtopped by the bractea, but often rising considerably above 
it.
Pair of bracteas under each flower of a shining brown, not 
white or greenish.
Calyx-leaves all oblong, and nearly fequal in 
breadth, as well as in length, with an obtuse, concave, or in- 
curved point, all of a chocolate brown, with a broad, tumid, 
green, striated, 3-ribbed keel, and closing round the capsule, 
which hardly ever extends beyond them, and is brown, obovate, 
triangular, bluntish with a small point, altogether less tumid 
than the foregoing.
Mr. E.
Forster found a dwarf variety of J.
coenosus, about 3 inches 
high, on the coast of Glamorganshire.
The appropriation of the synonyms of these two species is a matter 
of great difficulty, and after having studied the original authors 
with some care, I must submit them to the correction of future 
critics.

Root fibrous, slightly woolly, as in grasses that grow in sand.
Stem very slender, upright, a foot or more in height, naked,

Leaves very few, radical, 
shorter than the stem, erect, linear, narrow, acute ; convex and 
ribbed beneath 3 channelled, but shallow, above ; involute when 
dry ; dilated and membranous at the base.
Bracteas 2 or 3, 
leafy, erect ; the principal one rising above the panicle ; the 
others much shorter.
Panicle forked, of 3 or 4 very unequal, 
rather spreading, bratiches ; the larger ones also forked ; the 
upper part of all racemose.
Fl. nearly sessile, pale.
Calyx- 
leaves lanceolate, taper-pointed, acute, green, 3-ribbed, striated, 
with narrow, white, membranous edges.
Capsule pale brown, 
polished, oval, or slightly obovate, with a minute point, consi- 
derably shorter than the calyx ; valves very slightly emarginate.
Seeds very numerous, minute, pellucid, amber-coloured.
J. tenuis of Willdenow, and of Pursh, from Mr. F.
Boott, though 
similar to this, differs essentially in having the panicle cymose 
throughout, not racemose ; calyx-leaves broader, with 2 princi- 
pal ribs, of a light brown, the keel being green, and for the 
most part flat.
The panicle, calyx and capsule, in Gesner's figure most precisely 
answer to our J.
gracilis; but he accidentally represents a leaf 
on the middle of the stem.
Haller refers to this synonym under 
our compressus, with which it by no means agrees.
Mr. Bicheno 
is scarcely exact as to the chronology of the name gracilis ; for 
Mr. Brown's Prodromus appeared but in 1810, and I certainly 
had not seen it when p.
2174 of Engl.
Bot. was printed.
Ne- 
vertheless it is better to give up a name which may be disputed, 
and which has been variously applied before.
Gesner's synonym 
seems incontrovertible.

Root of several fibres.
Stems at first erect, from 2 to 6 inches 
high, slightly leafy, somewhat branched, subsequently reclining: 
bulbous at the base.
Leaves slender, acute, semicylindrical, 
channelled, not externally knotty or jointed ; though cellular, 
like the whole genus, within ; radical ones several, with a di- 
lated, membranous, often reddish, base, sheathing the bulbous 
part of the stems.
Fl. usually 3 together, in small, lateral or

Calyx-leaves lan- 
ceolate, acute, keeled, with 3 slender ribs; dark brown in decay.
Caps, light brown, narrow, prismatic, obtuse, a little longer

In (3, the stem being decumbent, several of the Jlowers are co- 
piously viviparous, whether from transformation of their organs, 
or premature germination of the seeds from wet, is not very 
evident.
The plant itself, on open wet heaths, is common enough.

Annual ?
May — July.
Herb either solitary, or numerously and densely crowded.
Root 
fibrous, apparently annual, quite simple, neither bulbous nor 
creeping j fibres smooth.
Stems 1 or more from the crown of 
each root, from 1 j to 4 inches high, simple, straight, upright, 
smooth, angular, striated, leafy at the very bottom only, and 
bearing at the top a terminal head oi flowers, sometimes accom- 
panied by another, near an inch below it.
In one very luxuriant 
specimen only I have seen the stem divided at this lower head, 
and bearing 2 others above it.
heaves several, radical, sheath- 
ing, erect, one third the height of the stem, very slender, acute • 
convex beneath j channelled above, and when dry involute, ouite 
smooth J sheathing at the base, with membranous edges.
Brac- 
teas 1 or 2 under each head, like the leaves, but much shorter, 
dilated and concave at the base.
Interior bructcas from 3 to 5 
under each head, spreading, lanceolate, acute, membranous, 
keeled, shorter than the calyx.
Ft. from 2 to 5, sometimes 10, 
or more, in each head, crowded, spreading every way.
Calyx- 
leaves ovate-lanceolate, concave, strongly keeled, membranous 
light brown, without ribs ; the keel green, firm, ending in a 
long, acute, bristly point ; 3 inner ones smallest and most deli- 
cate.

oblong, erect, spiral after flowering.
Stigmas 3, 
Caps, about the length of the stamens, not half so long as the 
calyx, roundish, triangular, membranous, obtuse.
Seeds nume- 
rous, oblong, striated, very minute.
Few species of Juncus, or of any other genus, have been more 
misunderstood than this.
The above description is drawn up 
from Mr. Hudson's original specimens, kindly communicated 
by Mr. E.
Forster, and compared with those of Ehrhart and 
other foreign botanists.
None can be more distinct.
The 3 sta- 
mens mark it well ; and the broad, flat-sided, membranous calyx- 
leaves, each with a strong keel and long taper point, but no late- 
ral ribs, diff'er totally from all the neighbouring species.
The 
denomination of supinus would be peculiarly inapplicable for a 
plant the most erect of all its tribe ; and what I have from the 
late accurate and learned Professor Lachenal, and Mr. Davall, 
for the indubitable J.
supinus of Moench, is my uliginosus /3.

2, but not of Lamarck, is very like our capitatus ; 
but is drawn, and distinctly described, with 6 stamens ; and Ca- 
vanilles may safely be trusted in what he professes to have seen.
The calyx moreover is not at all suitable to our plant.
J. Bauhin's 
J.foliatus minimus may be referred to either, but to no other 
known species.
Mr. Don's supinus, in my copy of his work, is 
evidently the common uli£;inosus, in a miserably starved condi- 
tion ; yet this brings him unconsciously, see Fl. Dan.
t. 1099, 
nearer the truth than any body.
Dr. Solander, in his manuscripts, gave the apt name of stellatus to 
Portuguese specimens of this Junciis, gathered by Dr. Gray ; 
but nothing can be better than capitatus, now, I trust, esta- 
blished beyond all uncertainty.

Fl. 2, terminal, one above an-

Leaves principally on the stem, erect, from 
2 to 4 inches long, smooth, keeled, flat at the sides, involute 
when dry ; cellular internally, with distant transverse partitions, 
but not really knotty or jointed ; convolute and sheathing at the

Root somewhat creeping.
Stems erect, straight, with from 4 to 6

low, leafy ; scaly at the base.
Leaves 3 or 4 on each stem, alter- 
nate, distant, upright, cylindrical, somewhat compressed, taper- 
pointed, hollow, divided internally by numerous, transverse par- 
titions, which give a jointed appearance, especially to the dried 
leaves.
Panicle terminal, erect, of 2 or 3 principal branches, 
which are once or twice forked, and partly racemose, with nu- 
merous, sessile, lateral or terminal, round, rusty-coloured heads 
of Jlowers.
Bracteas solitary, leafy, under the panicle, or its 
main branches ; the interior ones smaller, membranous, taper- 
pointed ; innermost, under each head, crowded, ovate, short and 
filmy.
Calyx-leaves lanceolate, all bristle- pointed, and uniform, 
of a rusty brown.
Caps, lanceolate, taper-pointed, acutely tri- 
angular, with concave sides, of the colour of the calyx, and but 
little longer, not very conspicuous.
Seeds minute, elliptic-ob-

Gerarde's figure seems to me a better representation of this than 
of the ohtusiflorus.
Our aciitiflorus is probably to be met with 
in Switzerland, but I find no traces of it in Haller, nor in any

Leaves compressed, 
with numerous internal partitions, giving the same knotty or 
jointed appearance as in the preceding ; their points a little re-

Panicle more erect, its branches strong, elongated, so 
that the heads oi flowers are remote, one above another, on each 
simple branch, with very few at the forks.
Fl. and capsules larger

Bracteas much the same.
Calyx-leaves lanceo-

a more evident white membranous border.
Caps, remarkably 
large, of a dark chocolate colour, highly polished, as if varnish-

point, extending much beyond the calyx.
Seeds small, not tu-

The establishment of this genus, so different in habit from 
JuncuSf and now so well determined by the character of 
its capsule, and the number as well as insertion of its 
seeds, can hardly be controverted.
I only beg leave to 
make an indispensable correction in the orthography of 
the name.
The hairy heads of flowers, wet with dew, 
and sparkling by moonlight, gave the elegant Italians an 
idea of their lucciole, or glow-worms ; sometimes written 
luzziole, but this is a provincial corruption.
Hence how- 
ever John Bauhin got the name of G7-a7nefi luzulee, or 
Glow-worm Grass, for he never called it Tmzula, which 
would have been the same as actually calling it a Glow- 
worm.
From a similar derivation, {luceo, to shine,) a La- 
tin name, Luciola, has been given to the Adder' s-tongue, 
Ophioglossum ; whether from the shining hue of that 
plant, or rather perhaps from its resemblance in form to 
a lamp with its wick, is of no consequence.
The name 
so apphed by Gesner and Dodonaeus, extant in Ambro- 
sinus, and even in Ainsworth, is now superfluous for the 
Ophioglossum, and is in fact the Latin of Luzula, this lat- 
ter being altogether corrupt, neither Latin nor good Ita- 
lian.

In shady groves, thickets, and on broken banks, among dead leaves, 
frequent.
Perennial.
March, April.
Root fibrous, increasing by runners.
Stem from 9 to 12 inches 
high, erect, round, slender, polished, leafy.
Leaves linear-lan- 
ceolate, entire, sheathing at the base, of a bright shining green, 
many-ribbed, fringed with a few long, white, lax hairs, especi- 
ally in an early state ; the radical ones numerous and large.
Panicle terminal, of numerous, unequal, capillary branches, 
spreading and reflexed in various directions, partly forked, partly 
in some degree racemose.
Fl. terminal, lateral, and axillary, 
always solitary, and nearly sessile, except the terminal ones.
Bracteas 2, close to each flower, unequal, ovate, brown, with 
membranous edges.
Calyx-leaves ovate, acute, keeled ; brown 
and striated at the back ; white and membranous at the mar- 
gin ; the 3 inner ones rather the smallest.
Caps, ovate with 3 
angles, blunt, pointless, pale green, scarcely so long as the ca- 
lyx.
Seeds elliptic-oblong, large, with a terminal hooked crest, 
nearly of their own length.
Lobel's figure, above quoted, like that in Bauhin's Theatrum, 101, 
has the panicle, but not the capsules or leaves, of our L.
Forsteri, 
which those authors might have seen, without distinguishing be- 
tween these two species.
Mr. Bicheno well remarks that the 
marginal hairs of the leaves are, when dry, twisted together in 
small parcels.
The herbage is eaten by cattle, in the early spring 
only, when little else is to be had.

this plant, ought, most assuredly, to be kept sacred.
There is a variety with a more dense panicle, which I have gathered 
in the woods at Roslin castle, and Mr. E.

This preserves its original appearance when cultivated, but 1 have 
found no specific distinction.

The late Mr. Teesdale proved this plant to be unaltered by culti- 
vation ; and its natural place of growth, size, and whole ap- 
pearance, have always seemed so strongly to indicate a distinct 
species from the common little L.
campestris, that I am induced 
at length to concur with those botanists who have separated 
them.
L. congesta has very erect stems, 18 inches high.
The 
leaves are much narrower than the last, with a minute callous 
roughness all along their edges, scarcely discernible in that.
The 
quantity of white hairs varies in both.
The panicle of the pre- 
sent is certainly very different, consisting usually of 7 or 8, 
roundish or ovate, dense obtuse clusters or spikes, the first almost 
sessile, the rest on long, partly spreading, stalks.
Calyx rather 
paler, more taper-pointed, scarcely extending beyond the cap- 
sule, which is of a rather narrower obovate form.
The figures of the old authors represent too small a number of clus- 
ters.
Mr. Purton's plate is excellent.
The plant figured in Linn.
Fl. Lapp.
t. 10./.
2, the original specimen of which is in the Lin- 
nsan herbarium, has paler, smaller, more oblong spikes, rather 
than clusters; amore pointed calijx; narrower, less hairy, though 
rough -edged, leaves ; and according to Dr. Wahlenberg, who 
calls it Junciis pallescens, in his Fl. Lapp.
87, a weak, compressed, 
nearly decumbent, stem.
There is another species, closely al- 
lied to these, in Virginia, whose leaves, nearly as tall as the stem, 
are not so properly rough-edged as minutely and remotely ser- 
rated.

Panicle with 1 or 
2 erect, leafy bractcas, solitary, terminal, drooping, an inch or 
more in length, dark chocolate-coloured, ovate-oblong, obtuse, 
many-flowered, dense, compound, more or less lobed, especi- 
ally at the base, intermixed with lanceolate, pointed, membra- 
nous, fringed or jagged, brown, interior bracteas, various in 
length.
Fl. nearly sessile, crowded, erect.
Calyx-leaves lan- 
ceolate, dark brown, with a .slender point, rather longer than the 
capsule, which is elliptical rather than ovate, slightly pointed 
with the base of the style, of a varnished chocolate brown ; the 
valves thickened at the edges, and each furnished with a central 
rib, or rudiment of a partition, but not more than in other spe- 
cies.
Seeds elliptical, nearly sessile, with some occasional traces 
of a lateral line, but no decided crest.
Juncus pediformis of Villars, unknown in Britain, is indeed nearly 
akin to this plant, but much larger, paler, more lax in the pa- 
nicle, and with broader leaves.
The capsule is ovate, tapering 
into a sharp point.
Wahlenberg associates it with the following, 
as a variety, but they appear very different.

Leaves deciduous, stalked, in tufts from lateral 
buds ; on the young branches alternate ; all somewhat obovate, 
more or less pointed, finely fringed.
Thorns at the base of each 
leaf-bud, three-cleft, spreading, sharp ; channelled underneath.
Clusters solitary from the centre of each bud, stalked, simple, 
many-flowered, pendulous, longer than the leaves.
Ft. bright

Ber- 
ries scarlet, powerfully but very gratefully acid ; reported to be 
sometimes yellow, sometimes white, purple, or black.
There is 
a cultivated variety without seeds.
The stamens have been found irritable in one small spot near tiie 
base, on the inner side, only, as explained by the writer of this 
in Phil.
Trans, t).
78.
158, and in a vol.
of Tracts, above quoted.
Many botanists mistake this phasnomenon.
Jussieu speaks of 
the filaments as elastic, and embraced for a while by the glands ; 
neither of which has any foundation.
They contract by irrita- 
bility, like the muscles of animals, and thus throw the pollen on 
the stigma.
Dr. Darwin, on my authority, attributes something 
of sympathy to the filaments, which does not exist, nor have I 
indicated any thing of that nature.
Many agriculturists charge the Barberry-bush with causing bar- 
renness, blight, or mildew, I cannot precisely say which, in 
wheat growing in its neighbourhood ; which others as positively 
deny.
Many highly respectable authorities, on each side, render 
me unable to form an opinion j nor am I aware of any hypothe- 
sis that could explain the fact.

Root strong, running deep into the ground, subdivided and tufted 
at the crown.
Stems solitary, erect, a span high, roundish, 
striated, panicled, almost leafless.
Leaves almost all radical, on 
\ongish footstalks, kidney-shaped, bright green, somewhat wavy, 
abrupt, with more or less of a central sinus ; ribs all radiating 
from the insertion of the footstalk.
Panicle erect, branched, twice 
as tall as the leaves.

Sir John Hill, it seems, first separated this plant 
from Riimex, and gave it the above generic name.
Sometimes, 
as Linnaeus says, a blind hen meets with a grain of corn.
Gsert- 
ner approved of the suggestion, though he did not follow it; but 
Mr. Brown has fully established the name and the genus.
The 
intelligent Dr. Wahlenberg conceived our Oxijria to be a Rheum, 
deprived of one third of the due number of parts in the fructifi- 
cation, of which there are many similar examples.
But though 
these two genera agree together in having a central, not lateral 
or marginal, embryo, in which they differ from Rumex ; such a 
character, too obscure for common practical use, can only be 
taken as indicative of generic distinctions or agreements, here 
confirmed, and essentially marked, by the respective numbers of 
parts of the flower.
By these Rheum differs from Rumex on the 
one hand, as Oxyria does on the other.
Rumex is deprived of 
a third part of the stamens of Rheum, Oxyria of one third of the 
styles of each.
Its winged seed, and central embryo, accord with 
Rheum ; its distinct calyx and corolla with Rumex ; for the Na- 
tural Order to which they all belong, is one in which the nature 
of these last parts is not uniform throughout.
The radiating ribs 
of the leaves in Oxyria, pointed out by Dr. Wahlenberg, as evin- 
cing some affinity to Rheum, occur in several Rumices ; witness 
R. scutatus, otherwise closely related to Oxyria.

In marshland ditches, stagnant waters, and the margins of great 
rivers, abundantly.
Perennial.
July, August.
Root large and tuberous, with numerous long hairy fibres.
Stem 
from 4 to 6 feet high, erect, stout, hollow, cylindrical, with nu- 
merous deep furrows, and strong, intermediate, smooth, reddish 
ridges, branched, leafy, copiously panicled.
Leaves stalked, lan- 
ceolate, acute, smooth, slightly glaucous, coriaceous, entire, 
but minutely crisped at the edges ; tapering, not heart-shaped, 
at the base j the lowermost often near 2 feet in length ; the 
uppermost small and narrow, almost linear, accompanying 2 or 
3 of the lower whorls.
Branches of the panicle a httle zigzag, 
beset with numerous, close, many-flowered whorls, most of them 
leafless.
FL drooping, on stalks of very unequal lengths, swelling 
at the top, and jointed, like all the foregoing, towards the base.
Petals in every stage much longer than the calyx, finally ovate- 
oblong, obtuse, reticulated with prominent veins, for the most 
part entire at the margin, though several of them are Avavy or 
notched, hardly toothed ; one or two of them bear an ovate- 
oblong, reddish tubercle, and the third a smaller one ; but the 
tubercles, though generally present on every petal, vary remark- 
ably in size and shape.
Seed ovate, acute, with thin sharp angles.

Rumex.
The true R.
aquaticus of Linnaeus, a Swedish plant, which is R.
acutus of Ehrh.
PL Off'.
104, and to which the synonyms of 
Lobel, Gerarde and Camerarius, quoted in Fl. Brit, belong, so 
nearly resembles this plant, that I have hitherto confounded 
them, supposing the absence or presence of tubercles to be va- 
riable.
Linnaeus had already fallen into the same error.
A 
more strict scrutiny has proved them distinct, and justified 
Mr. Hudson in establishing the present species, whose very 
astringent root has been celebrated as a cure for the scurvy.
The real aquaticus has its leaves heart-shaped at the base, and 
the permanent petals are broadly ovate, more finely veined, a 
little toothed, all entirely destitute of tubercles.
This is well 
figured in Camer.

a very distinct species, Haller's n.
1598, R.
arifoUus of AUioni, 
if not of Willdenow, whose petals are orbicular-heart-shaped, 
destitute of tubercles.
The whole plant is twice the size of the 
common R.
Acetosa, with divaricated lobes to the leaves.
Welsh 
specimens require to be examined.
It is reported that several 
species have, in Germany, been confounded under the present; 
but I know not on what their distinctions depend, nor whether 
we possess more than one in Britain.
Professor Hooker appears 
to describe a different plant from mine.

Like the last in general appearance, but differing essentially, ac- 
cording to the authors quoted, in having several procumbent 
leafy stems, throwing out radicles, with 1 or 2 leaves, and as 
manyjlowers, here and there, from the joints, in the manner of 
A. natans.
Towards the ends of the stems it appears that the 
flowers are not accompanied by leaves.
The petals are pale 
purple, and, according to Cavanilles, crenate.
I have not seen

Root slightly tuberous, .somewhat creeping.
Stem solitary, simple, 
erect, roundish, 3 or 4 inches high, almost naked, except at the 
top, where it is crowned with a tuft of leaves and very elegant 
white^owers.
Leaves crowded, on short stalks, obovate-oblong, 
more or less blunt, bright green, beautifully veined, entire, or 
obscurely serrated ; tapering at the base ; a few dispersed ones 
beneath much smaller and more obtuse.
Flower-stalks 1, 2 or 
3, among the leaves, not quite so long, erect, capillary, simple, 
naked.
Flowers solitary, sometimes only 5- or 6-cleft, of a bril- 
liant white, tinged with pink as they fade.
Jnth.

often reddish.
Seeds dotted, black, with snow-white reticulated 
tunics, like fine lace.
Few persons have seen the fruit of this plant, and it was most un- 
accountably mistaken, even by Linnaeus and Gsertner, though 
what little is said on the subject by Thalius is correct.
I have 
explained the history of this error in Dr. Rees's Cyclopaedia, and 
the above description will serve to correct that in Fl. Brit.
The 
valves of the ripe capsule become concave externally ; convex 
and polished within, and have been taken for a permanent co- 
rolla.
But they are opposite to the calyx-leaves, which the seg- 
ments of the cor.
are not.
The beautiful tunics of the seeds were 
supposed to be the skin of a dry berry, and are not faithfully re- 
presented by Gsertner.
Mr. Brown has suggested that this plant may probably be a real 
species of Lysimachia ; nor is there any thing against it but these 
tunics, and the number of the several parts of fructification.

Whole herb downy, soft, and clammy, 
exhaling a peculiar acidulous scent, justly compared to the fla- 
vour of boiled codlings and cream.
Stems 4 feet, or more, in 
height, round, leafy, branched and bushy.
Lower leaves oppo- 
site, clasping the stem, or in some measure decurrent ; upper 
alternate, and merely sessile ; all toothed.

Although there is but one known species of this genus, the 
most common, if not perhaps the original.
Erica of Dios- 
corides, Tournefort, or Linnaeus, its generic distinctions 
are so very important, that I gladly concur with Mr. Sa- 
lisbury, who first pointed out those distinctions.
To avoid 
the inconvenience of giving a new generic appellation to 
the hundreds of plants, familiar to every body as Ericce, 
or Heaths, he has judiciously called our common Ling, 
Calluna., from KctkXwco; which is doubly suitable, whether, 
with Mr. Salisbury and Dr. Hull, we take it to express a 
cleansing property, brooms being made of Ling ; or whe- 
ther we adopt the more common sense of the word, to 
ornament or adorn, which is very applicable to the flowers.
Gaertner indeed was so struck with the peculiar construc- 
tion of the capsule, that he adds a mark of admiration to 
his description.
He takes the plant as the type of Erica, 
OCTANDRIA— MONOGYNIA.

In some species the anthers bear at the base a pair of horns, 
in others a double notched crest.
The above description 
of the capsule agrees with all our English, and numerous 
exotic, European as well as Cape, species.
There are 
some indeed whose partitions are formed from the mar-

Maij.
A large, handsome tree, of quick growth, with a smooth ash- co- 
loured bark, and round, spreading branches.
Leaves on long 
footstalks, 4 or 5 inches broad, palmate, with 5 acute, variously 
serrated lobes ; the middle one largest j 2 outermost very small; 
veiny, smooth, except a little hairy tuft at the base ; pale or 
glaucous beneath.
Clusters axillary, solitary, pendulous, com- 
pound, many-flowered, downy.
Fl. green, the size of a currant- 
blossom, Anthers hairy between the lobes.
Capsules with 2, 
or 3, broad spreading wings, above an inch long.
The wood is white and soft, useful for many purposes.
The sap is 
said to yield some portion of sugar, and to be made into wine 
in the Highlands of Scotland.
Our variety /3, pointed out by the late Mr. Andrew Caldwell of 
Dublin, appears to have more elongated, distantly serrated.

fissures J that of the branches smooth.
Leaves about 1-^ inch 
wide, downy while young, like their footstalks, obtusely 5-lobed, 
here and there notched, sometimes quite entire^ Clusters ter- 
minating the young shoots, hairy, erect, short and somewhat 
corymbose.

Ours may possibly be 
E. triandra of Schkuhr and Hoffmann ; but I have never seen 
fewer than 6 stamens, and therefore their name is not unexcep- 
tionable J neither is their specific character, of the opposite 
jlowers, ever observable in English specimens.
Linnaeus consi- 
dered both Vaillant's plants as one species ; but, by his syno-

the Swedish plant is Vaillant's/.

But this still leaves 
its natural affinity in the dark.
It cannot be identified 
with EriccE, in character or habit : the ingenious Mr. Nut- 
tall has, however, traced its affinity to Pyrola.

decE of Brown, and somewhat in the same manner.

enveloped in a membranous reticulated ttmic, greatly elon- 
gated at both ends.

Perennial.
June.
Root fibrous, much branched, and somewhat creeping, growing 
among dead leaves, or in half-decayed vegetable mould ; but I 
could never find it truly parasitical, any more than Mr. Graves ; 
though the uniform pallid hue of the plant indicates it to be so.
Herb succulent, smooth, straw-coloured, turning quite black 
when dry, and exhaling, during that process, a very sweet and 
peculiar scent, approaching that of Vanilla, the flowers oi Or- 
chis nigra (Satyrium nigrum Linn.), the roots of Corallorrhiza, 
or other fragrant Orchidecc.
Stem mostly solitary, simple, 5 or 
6 inches high, round, beset with scattered ovate scales rather than 
leaves.
Cluster terminal, bent downwards while young, at length 
erect, of several^oujers, accompanied by bracteas like the scales 
of the stem.
Petals closed, a little spreading at the tips, 8 only 
in each flower, except the terminal one, which has 10.
Stamens 
as many as the petals, and more lasting, often hairy.
The 
smaller petals, which exist likewise in the American M.
lanugi- 
nosa, having perhaps fallen from Professor Hooker's specimen, 
may account for his figure and description not agreeing with 
what I have seen, and what Linnaeus and Dillenius accurately 
describe.
The anthers in our plant have, as Dr. Hooker says, 
but 1 cell } those of the single-flowered species seem differently 
constructed.
Haller refers to Rivinus, Tetrap.
Irr., for his Hypopitys ; but I find 
no traces of it.
Willdenow merely copies him^ or rather perhaps 
Reichard.

Leaves alternate, stalked, obovate, obtuse, entire, thick

Berry globose, de-

Seeds seldom more than 4 or 5 perfected,

His excellent figure of P.

Perennial.
June.
The herbage consists of several leafy, evergreen tufts.
Leaves nu- 
merous, spreading, rigid, almost orbicular, or rather kidney- 
shaped, being usually broader than long ; heart-shaped at the 
base ; besprinkled on both sides with rigid bristly hairs, which 
however are nearly wanting in both the varieties ; the under 
surface reticulated or speckled with purple ; the margin regu- 
larly and rather sharply crenate, scarcely cartilaginous, the ter- 
minal or central tooth shorter, and often broader, than the rest.
Footstalks twice, sometimes four times, the length of the leaves, 
narrow, linear, channelled, densely hairy.
Flower-stalks soli- 
tary, hairy, about a span high, panicled in the upper half, with 
numerous, alternate, corymbose, hairy, viscid branches.
Brac- 
teas small, linear-spatulate, spreading, hairy, solitary under each 
branch of the panicle, permanent.
Fl. small.
Segments of the 
calyx ovate, obtuse, reddish, hairy, obscurely 3-ribbed, strongly 
reflexed as soon as the flower is expanded, permanent.
Petals 
narrow-obovate, obtuse, cream-coloured, purplish at the base, 
with a dull yellow stain towards the middle of the disk.
Caps.
ovate, reddish, tipped with the short, brownish, more or less 
divaricated, styles.
I have long cultivated this species, sent by Mr. Mackay, and find 
it very little variable.
The petals have only a solitary spot of 
dull yellow on their disk, and the leaves are constantly purple at 
the back, most hairy on the upper side.
Magnol's elegant plate, 
indicated above, answers perfectly to our plant : but his descrip- 
tion, p.
87, agrees better with S.
hirsuta, especially as he there 
describes the leaves nearly round, and the petals with bloody 
spots.
Mr. Don's and my variety y has 3 or 4 crimson spots 
on each petal, besides a bright yellow stain, and the leaves are 
nearly, not quite, smooth.
If they were more hairy, I should 
have no doubt of Morison's/.
12 belonging to this variety ; nor 
indeed do I know what else it can be.
Lapeyrouse's t.

perhaps most like this y.

About the size of the last, or larger.
Leaves in large, rose-like,

cartilaginous serratures ; the base of each tapering gradually 
down into a broad, flat, nearly smooth, ybo^sia/Ar, at first shorter 
than the leaves, but subsequently becoming sometimes twice 
their length.
Common Jlower-stalk round, red and hairy, from 
4 to 6 or 8 inches high.
Panicle with several hairy, viscid, 
racemose branches, each bearing 3 or 4 alternate flowers, not 
forked like the preceding.
Cal. small, reddish, obtuse, closely

Pet. obovate-oblong, obtuse, pale flesh-coloured, 
stained with yellow near the base ; more or less covered with 
crimson dots on the disk.
Caps, ovate, reddish, entirely supe- 
rior, tipped with the short, nearly upright, styles.
Mr. Don's variety /3, which I have also from Mr, Mackay, is very 
unlike the original Linnsean specimen of S.
punctata from Sibe- 
ria.
The latter belongs to a different section of the genus, having 
the germen partly inferior ; the calyx broad and hemispherical at 
the base, with broad, triangular, spreading or erect, not reflexed, 
segments ; and nearly sessile stigmas.
Morison's/.
17 is justly 
excluded by Mr. Don from this variety, nor does it belong to the 
true punctata; but rather to S.
umbrosa, which is so common 
in gardens, and bears, like many other mountain plants, even 
the smoke of London, as its English name expresses.
The leaves 
in one of Mr. Mackay 's specimens, which may perhaps be Mr.
Don's y, have small, sharp, intermediate teeth, between the 
coarse serratures.

This has much affinity in habit to the last species, but is altogether 
destitute of a stem.
The leaves are perfectly radical, ovate or obo- 
vate, variously, but not deeply, serrated, most hairy or downy 
about tlie edges ; tapering at the base, which is entire, into a 
broad, flat, somewhat winged, footstalk, variable in length and 
width.
Flower-stalk generally solitary, radical, stout, from 3 to 6 
inches high ; downy and viscid at the upper part, terminating in 
a very variable dense cluster, either single or divided, of a few 
alternate flowers, on short hairy stalks, with lanceolate, fringed 
bracteas.
Cal. with a broad hemispherical base, embracing the 
lower half of the germen, and terminating in 5 broad, spreading, 
somewhat triangular, segments.
Pet. ovate, inserted into the 
rim of the calyx between its segments, white, with two pale 
green transverse spots, and tipped with the same colour.
Stam.

Caps, large, ovate, with 2 recurved 
beaks ; its lower half firmly united to the undivided base of the 
calyx.
Styles very short.
Stigma.' capitate, smooth.
5. nivalis is the only British species of Mr. Don's 4th section, 
named Micranthes ; a most natural assemblage ; but he has ju- 
diciously refrained from making any genei'ic division of Saxi- 
fraga.
The present section indeed, though so well distinguished 
from the last by the different position and situation of the calyx, 
is very nearly related to it, and I have therefore altered Mr. Don's 
arrangement, so far as to place these sections next each other.
The close affinity of their respective species, while they differ 
in subordinate characters, even of their fructification, affords the 
best evidence that the whole genus is natural and indivisible.

Stems numerous, prostrate, or pendulous, with many opposite,

Leaves small, imbricated in 4 rows, dark green, ovate, obtuse, 
slightly stalked, smooth, except a strong marginal fringe ; 
some of the uppermost abrupt at the point, and marked with 
1 or 2 perforations ; those on the young trailing shoots more 
distant, and opposite only.
Flowers terminal, solituiy, nearly 
sessile, large, handsome.

obtuse, fleshy, spreading, fringed segments.
Pet. obovate,

Caps, surrounded

The present species, with one, or perhaps two, exotic ones, di- 
stinguished by their opposite leaves, differ greatly in habit from 
the rest of the genus, and indeed from others of this section, 
so that it is difficult to arrange them according to any natural 
aflBnity.
The same may be said of the next.

In a morass about the centre of Knutsford moor, Cheshire, where 
Dr. Kingstone first pointed it out to Dr. Richardson, early in 
the I8th century, and from whence Mr. Okell of Chester sent 
the wild specimen delineated in Engl.
Bot. in August 1801, 
On Cotherstone fell, near the junction of the Blackbeck with 
the river Balder, Yorkshire, found by Mr. John Binks, some of 
whose specimens were given me by Mr. James Backhouse.
Perennial.
August.
Root tufted with numerous black fibres, sending forth from the 
crovpn many short, simple, decumbent, leafy shoots, often 
clothed with loose, rusty hairs.
Steins solitary, simple, erect, 
from 4 to 8 inches high, leafy, round, reddish, generally smooth, 
sometimes shaggy with rusty hairs.
Leaves scattered, lanceolate, 
obtuse, entire, bright green, smooth, except a few occasional 
soft marginal hairs; tapering at the base into a smooth foot- 
stalk, various in length.
Flowers terminal, corymbose, usually 
2 or 3, sometimes solitary; their stalks hairy and glutinous, 
with a linear bractea to each.
Cal. spreading at the first open- 
ing of thejlower, but soon becoming reflexed, being altogether 
inferior, as in the first section ; segments oblong, concave, ob- 
tuse, 5-ribbed, minutely fringed.
Pet. twice as long as the 
calyx, spreading, obovate, deep yellow copiously dotted with 
red, having many simple unequal ribs, confluent above the 
base, which ends in a short claw, and is marked with a nectari- 
ferous furrow, bordered by two prominent pointed valves.
Stam.
shorter than the petals.
Caps, oblong, tipped with the short 
angular styles, and broad, rounded, convex, downy stigmas.
Seech numerous, ovate, ribbed, of a shining brown.
A beautiful species, agreeing in its calyx and capsule with the 
first section, but hardly allied, by habit or peculiar characters, to 
any of the genus besides, except perhaps the following.

Perennial.
June — September.
Stems tufted, decumbent at the base, with many short, leafy, trail- 
ing shoots ; the flowering part ascending, 3 or 4 inches high, 
leafy, smooth or haiiy, unbranched ; panicled at the summit.
Leaves most crowded towards the root ; the upper ones most 
scattered ; all sessile, linear-oblong, obtuse, variously fringed 
with sharp, capillary teeth, which are scarcely ever entirely 
wanting.
Panicle leafy, generally simple, of 3 or 4 Jlowers ; 
sometimes branched and many-flowered ; the stalks glutinous 
and densely hairy.
Cal. of 5 broad leaves, encompassing the 
middle of the germen, and at all times widely spreading.
Pet.
a little longer than the calyx, obovate, or tongue-shaped, triple- 
ribbed, bright yellow, partly orange-coloured, besprinkled with 
scarlet dots.
Floral receptacle broad, depressed, surrounding 
the bases of the awl-shaped, spreading styles.
Stigmas obtuse, 
concave, downy.
Caps, rather more than half superior when 
ripe, crowned with the slightly elongated styles.
Dwarf alpine specimens, whose leaves are less evidently fringed, 
have been taken for -S.
autumnalis ; and are undoubtedly what 
many authors have described under that name, though a very 
little investigation is sufficient to prove them the aizoides.
What Linnaeus intended by his autumnalis is quite another 
question.
It appears that, at onetime, he gave this name to the 
Hirculus, figured in Breynius, t.
48, which plate he has marked 
autuinnalis.
At other times he had in view the fringed state of 
aizoides, considering the more naked-leaved specimens as tlie 
real aizoides, though his authentic ones thus named are very 
certainly fringed.
His autumnalis therefore cannot be quoted 
as a synonym of either of these species, nor is the name at all 
suitable to them.
The whole history of this confusion was 
given above 30 years ago in the 1st vol.
of English Botany, and 
Dr. Wahlenberg's remark confirms what is there advanced.

Herb densely tufted, very variable in luxuriance, number oijlowers, 
and degree of hairiness.
Kad'uul leaves numerous, more or less 
crowded, fringed with soft glutinous liairs, such as are generally 
likewise dispersed over both surfaces ; their lower half almost 
linear, strongly ribbed ; upper deeply divided into 3 or 5 ob- 
long, obtuse, pointless segments, made too acute in Engl.
Bot, 
t. 455.
Leaves of the flowering stems few, scattered, rather 
more acute, either undivided or three-cleft, diminishing into 
bructeas.
A few of the very lowest leaves, on the radical tufts, 
are also undivided.
Stems solitary, erect, round, rather hairy 
and viscid, slightly leafy ; in a only 2 or 3 inches high, and 
bearing 1 or 2, very rarely 3,Jlowe.rs; in /3 often a span in 
height, corymbose, with 5 or 6.
A root brought by Mr. Mackay 
from Brandon mountain, and rendered luxuriant by culture, bore 
9jlowers.
This is mentioned in Rees's Cyclopcedia Mr\Atx S.
hirta, 
but it certainly belongs to ccespltosa.
The calyx of this'species, 
in every state, is half inferior ; its segments broad, obtuse, point- 
less, slightly fringed, glandular, but scarcely hairy, on the sur- 
face.
Germen much more hairy, hemispherical.
Pet. orbicular,

rib, sending off 2 curved lateral ones about the middle, none of 
them quite reaching to the summit.
Stigmas downy.
When the larger variety of this species was published in Engl.
Bot.
I was unacquainted with Ehrhart's S.
decipiens, whose name I 
therefore could not adopt.
I have not quoted Professor Hooker, 
having seen no Scottish specimen of indubitable ccpspitosa, and 
he has, in my opinion, confounded many things under that name.
S. grcenlandica.
is, in the Cyclopcedia, only suspected to be a 
variety of ccespitosa.
I now believe them to be one and the 
same.
Whether Mr. Don's condensata, Tr. of L.

be a smooth variety of this, or, as the author says, allied to 
hypnoides, I have no means of judging, but in so very great a,

This has the habit of the larger variety of S.
ccespitosa, nor is it 
always more hairy ; on the contrary, my specimens are rather 
smoother than those of the foregoing.
The hirta seems to be fur- 
nished with longer lateral leafy shoots, and the segments of its 
leaves are acute, sometimes bristle-pointed, as are likewise those 
of the calyx.
The petals are obovate, not at all orbicular, and 
their lateral ribs are longer, usually separating from the middle 
one but a little above its base.
These two species nevertheless 
cannot be thought otherwise than very closely related, and I 
believe no botanist is, as yet, sufficiently acquainted with the 
specific differences of Saxfragce, to say whether they are distinct 
or not.

May, June.
This species, frequently cultivated in gardens, on rock-work, &c.
forms broad, elastic, dense tufts, of a light and pleasant green.
From the crown of each root i)roceed numerous long, entangled, 
procumbent, leafy shoots, as well as an upright, generally soli- 
tary, slightly leafy stem, 4 or 5 inches high, terminating in a 
corymbose panicle of from 3 to 5 white^^ower.s-, whose stalks arc a 
little viscid and glandular, as well as the scattered awl-shaped 
hracteas.
The radical and lower stem-leaves are linear, chan- 
nelled, and fringed at the base ; terminating in 3, rarely 5, lan- 
ceolate, spreading, smooth, bristle-pointed lobes ; those on tlie 
trailing shoots are almost universally undivided, ta])er-pointcd, 
•with fl more conspicuous bristle, and are often accom]ianied

Stigmas spatulate, scarcely at all downy.
Mr. Griffith has favoured me with an alpine ^V'elsh specimen, an- 
swering to Mr. Don's account of his condensata, but I cannot 
consider it as a distinct species.
Whether it be Gmelin's plant, 
I have had no opportunity of ascertaining.
Tab. 454 of Engl.
Bot. was indeed drawn from a very insufficient 
specimen of -S'.
hypnoides, and gives no just idea of the foliage.
With regard to Haller's n.
989 there is great uncertainty.
He has 
undoubtedly confounded the synonyms of various species under 
that number, and what the Swiss botanists take for .S'.
hypnoides, 
is either the Linneean ajugifolia, a plant in general not well 
known, I believe, to our 13ritish botanists and cultivators, or its 
near relation the exarata, Don n.

Mr. D.
Don on the 
other hand thinks the elongella perfectly distinct.
The lateral 
shoots are mostly erect, bearing 3-cleft leaves; but when culti- 
vated they become prostrate, with chiefly undivided leaves, and 
some appearance of axillary buds.
The injlorescencc is peculiar, 
consisting of a terminal, solitary, simple, single- flowered, leaf- 
less, slightly glandular and viscid stalk, 2 inches long, which, 
in cultivated plants only, is sometimes accompanied by 1 or 2 
divided bracteated stalks, from the bosoms of the upper leaves ; 
but nevertheless the whole bears no resemblance to the panicle 
of S.

In the calyx and petals indeed there is little

The flower is rather larger, of a pure white.

The leaves also differ essentially.
None of these are 
natives of Switzerland.
I have thus endeavoured to furnish the British botanist with ma- 
terials, at least, towards the history of this most difficult genus, 
correcting my own mistakes, but not presuming to reject, or to 
decide upon, any thing I have not examined.
It cannot but be 
remarked that many of the specific characters are too indefinite, 
and not discriminative ; the cause of which is that we are not 
as yet well acquainted with what constitutes a species in Saxi- 
fraga, nor how to define their difl^erences.
Notwithstanding the 
highly praise-worthy labours of Mr. Don, the exotic kinds, and 
especially the Swiss ones, require complete revision, by a com- 
parison of original specimens with living ones, both wild and 
cultivated.
The freaks of horticulture are eminently worth at- 
tention, as teaching us what to avoid ; for distinctions that 
appear, and vanish again, before our eyes, cannot serve as indi- 
cations of permanent species.
Genuine specific charact^;rs

[I believe the teeth, or valves, of the capsule are, in this 
whole order, either just as many as the styles, or more 
frequently double the number ; never bearing any relation 
in that respect to the calyx, corolla, or stamens, except 
incidentally.
Linnaeus therefore has greatly erred in his 
descriptions of several of the genera, which many writers, 
and even excellent draughtsmen, have followed, instead 
of looking at the plants before them.

The old synonym and figure of Clusius, Lobel, Gerarde, Dodo-

to any species but this ; which, though little understood, proves, 
as Lobel says, a very general plant.
I have wild specimens from 
Piedmont, Switzerland, Bohemia and Germany.
Some call it 
glaucus, some virgineus, and others piumariiis ; all erroneously, 
except that Linnseus did indeed refer it, as a variety, to his vir- 
gineus, but without comparing specimens, nor do they materially 
accord.
Nothing can be better than the description in Clusius, 
which is of primary authority.

I was led into the same error j see Tr. of Linn.

DECANDRIA TRIGYNIA.
CUCUBALUS baccifer, which has hitherto found a place 
in every British Flora, and which, in II.
Brit.
464, stands 
as the only representative of its genus, must here be 
omitted.
Dillenius, in his edition of Ray's Synopsis, 267, 
speaks of this plant as havmg been " gathered in hedges 
in Anglesea, [Mona,) by Mr. Foulkes of Llanbeder, and 
sent by him to Dr. Richardson." Now it appears, by a 
subsequent letter from the same gentleman, preserved in 
the archives of the Richardson family, and published in 
the Correspondence of LinncBus and other naturalists^ 
London 1821, v.
2. 171, that he, Mr. Foulkes, only re- 
ceived an account of the Cucubalus " from one who pre- 
tended to know plants very well," but that he could never 
find it, nor has this account ever been confirmed.
The 
figure in Engl.

from a garden specimen.

Linnaeus founded his genus 
Cuciibalus on the absence of scales at the base of the limb, 
which nevertheless are present in C.
baccifer, and which 
not only would often separate species most nearly akin, 
but are inconstant in the same species.
It is very re- 
markable that this great botanist should have attributed 
B teeth, or valves, to the capsule; whereas they are always 
6, being naturally double the number of the styles.
Yet 
several autliors have followed him.

Between Swafl^ham and Narford, Norfolk, on the grassy ridges of 
the road.
Also about Thetford, Barton mills, and Bury.
Perennial.
July, August.
Root strong, yellowish, cylindrical, running deep into the ground ; 
tufted at the crown.
Stem erect, from 1 to 2 feet high, round, 
leafy, downy, very clammy about the middle of the upper joint, 
below the panicle.
Leaves small, spatulate, acute, roughish and 
viscid, each tapering at the base into a long footstalk ,• radical 
ones numerous, tufted, and rather the largest, 2 or 3 inches long 
including the stalk.
Panicle oblong, erect, of many opposite, 
unequal, somewhat umbellate, simple or compound, erect 
branches.
Bracteas crowded, membranous, acute.
FL nume- 
rous, but small and inconspicuous, upright, greenish, dioecious, 
as even Caspar Bauhin remarked ; yet abortive stamens often 
occur in the fertile ones, as well as abortive pistils in the others.
Petals small, sometimes wanting, narrow, pale yellow, quite 
simple and entire, without scales.
Stijles variable from 2 to 5, 
but usually 3.
Caps, elliptical, filling the calyx, and projecting 
a little out of it, opening by 6 teeth.
1 know not whether that 
number varies with the styles, but it is probable.

June, July.
The very long and branching roots penetrate deeply into the clefts 
of rocks, and are crowned by short, branched, densely tufted, 
leafy, moss-like stems ,• for the plant is not really acaulis, though 
destitute of the elevated stem proper to most of its genus.
Leaves 
opposite, crowded, linear, bright green, smooth, except a slight 
fringe at the base, as well as on the broad ^palc footstalks, which 
sometimes extends to the acute point of each leaf.
Fl. terminal, 
solitary, on smooth simple stalks, variable in length.
Cal. smooth, 
tinged with violet, the teeth blunt, minutely fringed.
Pet. of an 
elegant rose-colour, occasionally white, slightly, and not always, 
cloven at the extremity, and bearing a minute cloven scale at 
the base of the limb.
Caps, ovate, becoming cylindrical as it 
ripens, and finally twice as long as the calyx, opening by 6 valves 
at the summit.
The /lowers have no scent, but they constitute 
one of the most charming ornaments of the green-headed Scot- 
tish Alps, which, seen from the still loftier Ben Lomond, resemble 
the waves of a boundless ocean.

This plant is, in every character, notwithstanding the variable

wonder at its having been referred to Jlsine ; and still more, 
that Linnaeus should, in his Fl. Lapp.

Of a middle size between the two last species ; distinguished from 
<S.
holostea by its perfect smoothness, shorter leaves, and 3- 
ribbed calyx ; from S.
graminea by its glaucous hue, and larger 
petals ; from both by its erect, more dispersed, often axillary 
and solitary, much less panicled, Jlower-stalks.
The petals are 
almost twice as long as the calyx ; more deeply cloven, and 
narrower, than in S.
holostea -, though larger and rather broader, 
than in the graminea.
Anth.
of a pale reddish hue.

whose simple slender stalks are glutinous, and uniformly downy 
in every direction, one or both of them bearing a pair of small 
bracteas.
Leaves about | an inch long, entire, single-ribbed, 
recurved, uniformly smooth in the original Linnaean specimens, as 
well as in every British, Lapland, or Swiss one that I have seen ; 
so that 1 think there must be some mistake in the Flora Scotica.
Calyx-leaves with a hairy keel, the outermost sometimes fur- 
nished with 2 small lateral ribs.
Pet. nearly twice the length 
of the calyx, cloven scarcely half way down.
-Styles almost in- 
variably 3 ; I have once only seen 4, and Wulfen mentions 5.
Caps, tw.ce as long as the calyx, cylindrical, with 6 teeth, 
though that number is doubtless increased to 8 or 10, when the 
styles are more than their proper number.
Seeds rough.
Se- 
veral botanists have confounded this plant with the smooth va- 
riety of Cerastium alpinum, which is essentially distinct, though 
Linnceus himself seems, by his herbarium, to have sometimes 
fallen into the same error.
1 suspect Wulfen has done so ; for 
though his specimens, sent by Jacquin, are really Stellaria ce- 
rastoides, his figure is more like Cerastium alpinum, particularly

and perhaps too various, in the rest of the species, to be de- 
pended on.

this with the narrow-leaved ones.

toothed bracteas, on short stalks, solitary under each flower.

Linnaeus confused himself among the synonyms of old writers, and

Roots fibrous, thrown out here and there from the recumbent, en-

leafy, with several short, densely leafy, barren shoots from the 
bottom.
Leaves thick, of a dull green, often brownish, scarcely 
glaucous, tapering to a bristly tip ; their base having a short 
spur below their point of attachment, as in some of the preced- 
ing ; but that character does not serve for a natural division of 
the genus.
Fl. bright yellow, numerous, in a dense, terminal, 
more or less level-topped cyme, whose branches and stalks are 
smooth ; the outermost frequently recurved.
Segments of the 
calyx ovate, bluntly pointed, scarcely half so long as the lanceo- 
late rather obtuse petals.
The lower leaves are often recurved, 
in consequence of the pendulous posture of the stems or branches, 
but the specific name seems to have originated from the gene- 
rally reflexed position of the Jlower-slalks, expressed by the term 
scorpioides.

Differs from the last in being of a more glaucous hue, with much 
more slender leaves, especially on the radical shoots.
The 
branches of the ajme are more uniformly spreading, and the 
segments of the cuh/x narrower and more pointed.
It is extremely difficult to adjust the synonyms of old authors, 
between this and the reflexum, because the latter varies in the 
position of \tsJlower-stallcs, and it appears that writers who di- 
stinguished them as species have not always known what their 
predecessors intended.
The excellent cut of Fuclisius, referred 
to this by C.

Very distinct from S.
rupestre, with which it has been confounded, 
in the bright-green colour of its foliage, which is even less glau- 
cous than represented in Engl.
Bot.
; but the short rosaceous 
tufts of spreading leaves, which are blunt, with a small bristly 
point, more essentially distinguish it.
Theflowers grow in a true 
cyme, all the primary stalks springing from one point.
The calyx 
in this and the last has more shallow, short, elHptical and obtuse 
segments, than in either of the two preceding.
Each leaf of 
S. Forsterianum has a dark spot, or pore, at the back, just below 
the point, as in the uncoloured separate figure of Engl.
Bot. But 
of this there are also traces, even in dried specimens of S.
ru- 
pestre.
Mr. Griffith and Mr. Forster are of opinion that the 
present is the only one, of these two species, ever found in 
Wales.

the very hard and tough calyx, and undivided petals, whose 
teeth moreover, when present, are peculiarly horny and sharp, 
unlike those of any other plants of this natural order ; but they 
are wanting in our only British species.
This weed should be eradicated by hand before flowering.

Great misconception has prevailed among botanists concerning 
these two species, owing to Linnaeus having misquoted Vaillant.
I have been at some pains to ascertain their respective syno- 
nyms, from original authorities at Paris and Oxford ; but it is 
impossible to guess what Willdenow intended, as he did not dis- 
cover the error of Linnteus.
Our British botanists, except Mr.
Lightfoot, have been regulated merely by the misapplied svno- 
nyms of Vaillant, and were therefore led astray.
The plants 
are common enough ; but Linnaeus originally described the v'lSr- 
cosum only, which is really viscid, though his vulgatum hap- 
pens to be generally more so.

I have never seen or

indubitably a most distinct species, displaying itself on every

Jtoot small and slender.
Herb of a bright light green, clothed

Leaves elliptic-oblong j the 
upper ones short and ovate.
Flower-stalks nearly thrice the

specimen, is very correct and characteristic.
Of the distinctions 
between this species and the last there is no question ; nor can 
any good botanist who has really compared them together, all 
theory apart, have a doubt remaining.
There is more uncer- 
tainty about our tetrandrum and the Spanish pentandrum, which 
it most resembles in size, habit, colour, and calyx ; but C.
pentan- 
drum has 5 -cleft flowers with small, acute, scarcely cloven , pe^aZs, 
and a remarkably broad membranous margin to the cahjx.
The 
Jlower-stalks moreover, even when in fruit, do not exceed the 
calyx in length.
It is true that the flowers of C.
tetrandrum by 
culture now and then become 5 -cleft and pentandrous ; but its 
taper-pointed calyx is alone sufficient to keep it distinct from 
the semidecandrum.

The Linnaean speci-

Switzerland, quite hoary, even shaggy with long woolly, or 
silky, jointed hairs, as in Lightfoot's figure.
The hairs are too

I have ripe capsules,

Root small, tapering.
Stems spreading, lax, from 6 inches to 2

the lower part ; angular upwards ; hairy and viscid, especially 
in the upper part ; each branch terminating in a forked, divari-

Leaves numerous at every joint, 
irregularly and imperfectly whorled, linear, narrow, fleshy, 
downy, sometimes nearly smooth, bluntish ; flat above ; rounded 
beneath.
Stipulas in pairs under each whorl, membranous, very 
.short.

Caps, longer than 
the calyx, splitting more than half way down into 5 undivided 
teeth or valves.
Seeds numerous, roundish, commonly black, 
tumid and angular, with an obsolete border, and covered with 
small tubercles or bristles ; but in /3 they are compressed, 
.smooth, with a narrow whitish membranous border; and in y 
they are quite flat, pale with a dark edge, and a white, mem- 
branous, striated border, or wing, equal to the seed itself irj 
breadth.
I concur with Professor Hooker in considering B as but a slight 
variety, there being not the smallest difference in the size or struc- 
ture of any part of the plant, except the seeds, in which indeed 
the difference is remarkable.
But intermediate appearances 
may be traced between the round I'ough angular seeds of the 
common Spurrey, and the smooth, lenticular, bordered ones of 
this variety.
There is the same difference in Arenaria marina, 
compared with rubra ; but there are presumed to be other spe- 
cific marks between these two plants.

gula pentandra, of which I have Loefling's original specimens 
described by Linnaeus, as well as Ehrhart's ; and others gathered 
by Mr. Schleicher in Switzerland ; differs from (3 as Arenaria me- 
dia does from marina, in having a broad, white, striated, orbicular 
wing to each seed.
This Dr. Wm.
Sherard must be presumed 
to have gathered in Ireland ; but I have seen no native speci- 
mens.
AH the foreign ones now before me are much smaller 
than either of the preceding varieties, being from 2 to 6 inches 
high ; and the annular swelling under each joint, mentioned 
by Dr. Wahlenberg, may be perceived ; but I find nothing 
like a decisive character, in the stem, leaves, or other parts.
The 
stamens are said to be 5 ; Lcefling once saw 7 ; they are also 
usually 5 in our (3 ; but their number is certainly variable in all 
the three varieties.
I think Arenaria media and marina, above 
alluded to, sanction the union of these three Sperguke ; if the 
latter do not persuade us to refer those two Arenaria' to the 
rubra.

Roots creeping, entangled, with numerous, branching, stout fibres; 
their scent when bruised very peculiar, partaking of pepper and

Stems very short and simple, round, each bearing two dark 
green, shining, kidney-shaped, rather downy, leaves, two inches 
wide, on long downy stalks, and one drooping ^flower, not an 
inch long, fleshy in substance, of a lurid and singular aspect.
The powdered leaves are used to provoke sneezing ; a few grains 
at a time may be safely taken, and they produce a considerable 
discharge of fluid by the nostrils.
The herb increases plenti- 
fully by seed, without any care, as well as by root, in dry shady 
situations.

Caps, pitcher-shaped, angular, tumid, cori- 
aceous, open at the top between the styles, of 1 cell.
Seeds numerous, kidney-shaped, stalked, ranged along 3 
lateral longitudinal receptacles.
The styles are occasionally 4 in various species, and the re- 
ceptacles of the seeds always agree with them in number.
Nothing can be more various, or more changeable, than 
the forms of the petals, or lumiber of the stamens.
The 
plants are herbaceous, their surface minutely papillary, 
not hairy ; when bruised they are foetid, though the 
jloxmrs of some are fragrant.
Leaves alternate, simple, 
mostly pinnatifid.
Fl. numerous, pallid, racemose.
Mr. J.
Lindley, in a work no less scientific than splendid, 
has given a most ingenious, though perhaps too meta- 
physical, view of this genus, in which he considers the 
flowers as aggregate, or capitate, the lateral ones being 
but rudiments, represented by some of the petals, and 
the central one alone perfect.
Mr. Brown's idea of An- 
thoxanthum and Hierocle, see v.
1. 37 and 110, is some- 
what analogous to this.

EUPHORBIA, placed by Linnaeus in this Order, is now 
understood by .lussieii and Brown to have separated 
flowers, conformably to the general character of its natu- 
ral order.
What Linnanis and others have taken for 
sf aniens, appear to be distinct nionandrous barren JiarxerSy 
destitute of calyx and corolla, and each consisting mert ly 
of a stamen, distinguished from its stalk by a separating 
joint only, occasionally marked with some discoloration.
The number of these^oTO^?-^ is indefinite, their period of 
perfection various, and they stand, several together, in 
one common im^olucrum, with a central, solitary, /iv///?
jiawer.
Consequently Euphoi-bia is to be removed to 
Moncecla Monandria.

Branches round, with a polished ash-coloured bark, whose cuticle

Leaves ovate, or ovate-lanceolate, pointed, 
veiny, with copious glandular serratures, and at the base 2 un- 
equal glands, sometimes removed to the /ootefa/A; ,- the upper 
surface smooth ; the under more or less hairy, especially about 
the veins.
These hairs disappear in the cultivated varieties, and 
though mentioned by Linnseus as tlie mark of h's P.
avium, do 
not form a specific distinction.
It is hard indeed to define species 
or varieties in plants so generally cultivated, and so widely pro- 
pagated by birds, and other natural or artificial means; being 
meanwhile subject to every possible accident of cross impregna- 
tion.
The powers in all the kinds are white, on long simple 
stalks, but few together, in umbels produced by different buds 
from the foliage.
Fruit almost globular ; in a, from which the 
common Kentish Cherry is but one remove, red, acid, and au- 
stere ; in /3 said to be smaller and heart-shaped; in y small, 
round, red, not ripe before September ; in S rather small, 
roundish, black, and sweet ; in e larger and of a better flavour, 
but of the same colour, to which its name from Corone, a Crow, 
appears to allude.
The leaves in every variety are simply folded

A moderate-sized tree, without thorns.
Leoves elliptic- oblong, 
copiously serrated, rarely glandular at the base ; hairy when 
voung, especially underneath ; their edges coiled inward in the 
bud.
Stipulas linear, bordered with glands, deciduous.
Flower- 
stalks much shorter than in the Cherry, most frequently in pairs.
Fl. snow-white.
Fruit rather oblong, seldom quite globular, 
its colour and flavour very variable.
The sjjecimen sent by 
Mr. Borrer was almost round, dark purple, with a blue efflo- 
rescence.
Mrs. Evelyn has communicated to Mr. Lambert, from 
Kent, flowering specimens of " a wild yellow plum, excellent 
for making jelly only," known to the London confectioners.
These specimens approacii Ehrhart's P.
curvata; but the 
branches are more downy, and we know nothing of his fruit.
Whether all our cultivated Plums may formerly have originated 
from the P.
insititia hereafter described, its thorns having dis- 
appeared by culture, like those of the Pear-tree, is a question 
which no botanist perhaps can ever solve.
As to its varieties, 
Gerarde declares that " to write of Plums particularly would re- 
quire a peculiar volume, and yet the end not be attained unto, 
nor the stock or kindred jjerfectly known, neither to be distin- 
guished apart." He adds that each country has an abundance of 
its own peculiar varieties.
Hence I conceive it scarcely possible 
to meet with the P.
domestica in a perfectly natural state.

Shrub.
March, April.
A rigid bushy shrub, with sharp spinous branches ; the bark blackish, a 
little glaucous and polished.
Leaves much smaller than the last, 
scarcely an inch long ; the earlier ones obovate ; all smooth, ex- 
cept when very young.
Fl. pure white, copious, earlier than the 
leaves, solitary, on short simple stalks, each from a small bud at 
the bases of the leaf-buds.
Calyx spreading.
Pet. with scarcely 
any claws.
Fr. globular, black, rather larger than a black cur- 
rant, acid, astringent, and very austere, not eatable except 
when baked or boiled with a large proportion of sugar.
The 
juice, inspissated over a slow fire, is a substitute for the Egyp- 
tian Acacia, or Indian Catechu.
In some form or other, this 
juice is said to be used in factitious or adulterated Port wine.
The leaves also are reckoned among the adulterations of tea in 
England.
They possess, in fact, a portion of that peculiar aro- 
matic flavour which exists in Spircea Ulmaria,p.
368, the Ameri- 
can Gnullhrria, and some other plants, and which resembles the 
more delicate perfume of green tea.
A water distilled from the 
blossoms of the Sloe is said to be used as a medicinal vehicle in 
Switzerland and Germany ; but it surely is not very safe or 
wholesome.

Soc. v.
1 3.
88 — 
106, in denominating this fruit Sipomum, or apple ; rather 
than a bacca, berry, with Linnaeus and Gaertner.
I wish 
moreover to restrict the term driipa to a fleshy fruit with a 
solitary nut.
See Grammar 23.
The genus Pi/nis, as I 
understand it, exhibits a gradation of membranous and 
cartilaginous cells in the apple, some of them close, some 
valvular ; and in Mespilus the same part is similarly con- 
structed, though of a harder substance.
Each seed, in 
both, has a double skui.
It is perhaps to be wished that 
Crataegus could be kept separate from Mespilus, but I 
cannot perceive the fruit to be more open, or the cells 
more exposed, in one than the other.

habit, inflorescence, and the leafy calyx, Cratcegus parvi-

Nobody can be mox'e

which he has met them, though we may differ in opinion

Gaertner first ventured to unite the above Linnsean genera, 
including the Quince, Cydonia j but the latter having 
very numerous horizontal seeds, may perhaps form a ge- 
nus along with Pyrus japonica, whose fruit being erro- 
neously described by Thunberg, as having 5 valves, 
caused Mr. Lindley to make it distinct.
But this fruit 
is no more valvular than an apple, and greatly resembles 
a quince in odour.
The cells of the fruit in Pyrus vary, 
even in one species, the common Pear, from cartilaginous to 
membranous, and gradations in texture from one species 
to another are so insensible, that they baffle all generic 
distinction.
The bony cells of Mespilus, each of one 
piece, and not splitting asunder, perhaps sufficiently mark 
that c;enus.

May.
A handsome tree, of slow growth, with a tough, close-grained, 
not very hard wood; the branches smooth, round, greyish.
Leaves smaller than the last, being scarcely a span long ; their 
lenjlets narrower, more firm, downy beneath, not cottony, when 
young ; afterw'ards smooth on both sides.
Panicles corymbose, 
broad and flattish, with downy stalks.

are styles, the sides of which are pliant and leathery, not carti-

Seeds 2 in each cell, though only 1 in general 
becomes perfect.
Of the strict generic affinity between this 
and the last, notwithstanding the different consistence of the 
cells of their fruits, there can be no doubt.
Many superstitious qualities are attributed by the Scottish High- 
landers to their Roan-tree, which is especially famous as a pro-

Birds of the Thrush kind devour them with avidity ; 
and our Mountain Ash trees, planted for ornament in most

the fruit, which are soft and jDliant like those of the Mountain 
Ash, agree with them in number.
Whether this be a mere va- 
riety of the P.
Aria hereafter described, or, as Linnseus tliought, 
a mule between that tree and the Mountain Ash, it is regularly 
propagated by seed, and a frequent decoration of modern gar- 
dens and shrubberies.
A decided variety of P.
Aria, slightly 
pinnatifid, growing on Castle Dinas y bran, was taken by Mr.
Hudson for the Linncean Sorbus hybrida.
Dr. Pratinton has 
sent me this from the original spot, and it obviously connects

Tree.
May.
A tree of a moderate size, whose young branches are very wiiite 
and downy j the old bark reddish brown, and smooth ; the wood 
very hard.
Leaves on downy stalks, elliptic-oblong, doubly ser- 
rated ; sometimes with several marginal lobes, which is the cha- 
racter of /3, but not pinnatifid at the lower part as in the pre- 
ceding ; the upper surface smooth, of a fine green ; the under 
snow-white, and downy, marked with several straight, promi- 
nent, transverse ribs, having correspondent furrows above.
Sti- 
pulas a slight, membranous, smooth dilatation, at each side of 
the bottom of the footstalks, generally elongated into lanceolate 
appendages, or real slipulas, which soon fall oif.
Fl. white, in 
large corymbose compound tirfts, with downy stalks.
Bracteas 
linear, smooth, deciduous.
Styles 2, often 3 or 4.
Fruit with 
as many coriaceous cells, globular, scarlet, dotted, mealy, acid 
and astringent.
Seeds 2 in each cell.
Ehrhart's authentic specimen of )3 accords with my Welsh ones, 
differing from the common Aria in having rather deeper margi- 
nal notches, or lobes ; but the I Yives are not truly pinnatifid.
Willdenow declares it to differ in its whole habit from P.
Aria, 
which I can find nothing to confirm.
There can scarcely be 
found a tree of the Aria on which some leaves do not answer to 
this variety.

This is the

account of its beauty and fragrance, but one of the most dif- 
ficult with respect to the determination of its species.
Mr.
Joseph Woods, in the essay above quoted, and Mr.
,Tohn 
Lindley, in a more recent Monograph, have greatly il- 
lustrated this subject.
My learned friends Mr. Sabine and 
Mr. Edward Forster have also favoured me with many 
valuable remarks.
With these guides, and my own ex- 
perience of 23 years since the publication of this genus in 
the Flo7-a Britannica, I proceed to a more accurate ac- 
count of our British Roses.
The terms I shall employ 
are such as are in familiar use, through every department 
of botany, and therefore require no particular explana- 
tion.
I am obliged to decline the use of one word, first intro- 
IC08ANDRIA— POLYGYNIA.

duced into English in the history of the present genus, 
but not by Mr. Woods, sepals, sepala, for the divisions, 
whether segments or leaves, of the calyx.
Those 
who are much conversant with the system of Jussieu 
cannot but perceive the frequent difficulties that arise 
between him and Linnaeus, in determining whether, in 
certain genera, the calyx is of one piece or of many, and 
this question embroils the fundamental characters of 
some of Jussieu's orders.
His distinguished follower 
Professor DeCandoUe has attempted to remove this 
difficulty, by adopting a common term for the leaves or 
the segments of a calyx ; so that in future botanical 
language there shall be no distinction between them.
But it is surely better to encounter some ambiguities in 
the study of nature", than to confound things or ideas 
that are essentially distinct; and it is better that any 
system, whether natural or artificial, should be honestly 
acknowledged defective, rather than that clear generic 
differences should be neglected or invalidated.
In Rosa 
the fruit, or hip, is only in appearance intermediate in 
nature between its own natural order and the Pomacea;.
The calyx is of a single leaf, whose limb has 5 deep seg- 
ments, and whose tube becomes, as Mr. Woods properly 
understands it, the receptacle of the seeds ; but this tube 
is not itself a germen, like that of the Pomacece, though 
Linnaeus so denominated it.
The analogy of the whole 
order of Rosacea; shows its real nature.
So important a 
distinction requires to be marked, but the term sepala 
designedly leaves it ambiguous.
This word itself, adopted 
from Necker, an obscure and paradoxical writer, might 
long puzzle a student, who would perhaps not conceive 
the highest veneration for its contriver, on finding sepala 
a lame anagram of petala.
If such be the case, as I 
Iiave been informed, it renders all further remarks su- 
perfluous.
Mr. Woods I believe first suggested the importance of 
glandular bristles, setce, on the stems of Roses, as con- 
stituting a primary character.
This, as far as I have 
had experience, is perfectly well-founded.
The pre- 
sence of these bristles on the stem or branches consti- 
tutes the essential mark of my first section.
The form 
of the prickles, acnlei, whether straight and slender, sud- 
denly originating from a broad depressed base ; or 
hooked, dilated gradually downward, and more or less 
' 2 B 2 
S72 ICOSANDRIA— POLYGYNIA.
Rosa.
compressed, is perhaps of the next degree of hnportance.
I do not so much regard the frequent inequahty of these 
prickles.
The transition of the upper stipulas into brac- 
teas is nearly general in British Roses, and therefore less 
discriminative than Mr. Woods in some cases makes it.
The simple or double serratures of the leaflets, and even 
their pubescence, are in my opinion duly appreciated by 
this judicious vv^riter.
The characters derived from 
hence do indeed occasionally vary, as is the case, more 
or less, with every botanical distinction.
There is no 
mathematical certainty in natural history, our definitions 
being generally but a choice of difficulties.
The occa- 
sional failure in particular instances, even of specific 
characters generally most decisive, as opposite, or alter- 
nate, entire or serrated, leaves, does not overset our ge- 
neral confidence in those distinctions.
So neither does 
a partial or occasional change in the leaves of Roses, 
from simple to compound serratures, prove such differ- 
ences entirely futile.
I am led therefore, by a careful 
revision of the genus, to think the accidental mutations 
to which I allude have induced Mr. Lindley to combine 
too many species together ; while Mr. Woods, by too 
absolute dependance on some characters, has perhaps 
now and then made species of varieties.
In the study 
of a genus hitherto imperfectly understood, the latter is 
the least injurious error.
Corrected judgment may, 
hereafter, combine what precise observation, in the first 
instance, has with due caution separated, and my spe- 
cific definitions may then be curtailed.
I trust that 
neither of my intelligent friends will feel offended if, in 
a matter of so much conjecture, uncertainty, and no- 
velty, I, in a few instances, differ from them.
What we 
have done may afford a clue for the guidance of others, 
who will try all our principles, by applying them to 
practical use.
In the synonyms of foreign authors, un- 
less verified by a comparison of specimens, I have been 
very sparing, seeing how many mistakes are daily made 
by compiling or copying, instead of observing.

Stem 4 or 5 feet high, with irregular, spreading, leafy, round 
branches, of a dark purplish brown, beset with very slender, 
white, glandular-tipped bristles, often wanting, as Mr. Woods 
remarks, on the upper part of the plant, and ahvays soon deci- 
duous ; so that they are rarely observable on dried specimens, 
though the small papillary points, from which they originated, 
may easily be seen.
Prickles very few, generally in pairs under the 
young branches, small, slender, pale, slightly deflexed, each with 
a dilated, oblong, flat base.
Common footstalks slender, round, 
slightly compressed, downy, almost uniformly without prickles, 
each with a pair of oblong, acute, membranous, smooth, pur- 
plish, wavy, combined stipulas, fringed with sessile glands, at- 
tached to its base ; the upper stipulas, wanting leaves, be- 
come simple and dilated, assuming the form of alternate brac- 
teas.
Leaflets 5 or 7, elliptic-lanceolate, r,cute.
simply but un- 
e(iually serrated ; of a greyish green, and nearly naked, above ; 
glaucous and finely downy beneath ; the lowermost gradually 
smallest.

Tube of the calyx smooth,

segments of the limb very long and narrow, each with a lanceo-

edges densely downy ; one or two of them sometimes bearing 
a few linear marginal appendages.
Petals broad, concave, 
light crimson, or purplish, rather shorter than the calyx ; their 
claws pale and veiny.
Stam.

Styles still shorter, 
very hairy, with smooth, blunt, green stigmas.
Fruit globose, 
rarely tapering at the base, the size of a white currant, of a 
reddish, orange-colour.
The flowers, even in the double va- 
riety, have very little scent, though some writers compare them 
to Cinnamon.
This Rose may possibly be wild in the place above mentioned, 
as it grows in most parts of Europe.
It is scarcely known in 
gardens, except with double flowers.
The bristles, first no- 
ticed by Mr. Woods, are hardly to be seen except on fresh 
specimens.
The prickles are always more or less deflexed, 
sometimes a little hooked, as described in R.
fcecundissima of 
authors.
The second specimen in the Linneean herbarium, 
mentioned by Mr. Lindley, has double flowers, and by its 
ticket appears to have come from a garden, not from a wild 
Swedish plant.
I cannot find any difl'erence between the R.
via- 
jalis, the mutica of Fl. Dan., and the cinnamomea, any more

I have them from

The editors of the

one of them has therefore been deceived by the drawing of ^ 688, 
to define the footstalks synooth.
He has also misquoted synonyms

leq/fets,Jlower-stalks, and segments of the calyx, sometimes on 
the lower part of its tube.
The footstalks are often prickly be- 
sides.
The siipulas are glandular at tlie margin, dilated, undu- 
lated, and leafy, but hardly ever become bracteas, though I have 
an example or two of such a change.
Leajlets from 7 to 1 1, not 
more, broadly elliptical and bluntish, with broad, acute, mostly 
simple, rarely notched or glandular, serratures ; smooth and 
green on both sides, except the rib; paler beneath.
Mr. Woods 
has remarked a few chaffy scales at the insertion of the leaflets.
Flower-stalks solitary, simple, rough with glandular bristles.
F/.
either blush-coloured, or white blotched with pink.
Seg- 
ments of the calyx quite simple, reddish ; slightly downy on 
the inner side ; bristly at the back, like some of the lower por- 
tion of its tube.
Fruit bright scarlet, globular, with a short 
neck, and crowned with the limb of the calyx.
The colour of the fruit, though it cannot well enter into a spe- 
cific definition, affords a striking distinction between this and 
the following species.
The supposed variety from Mr. Lee's 
nursery, bearing a short blackish fruit, as described by 
Mr. Lindley, was, I am told, a foreign plant, and it appears 
that R.
rubella of this author is different from my original one, 
whose fruit is neither elongated, nor I believe pendulous.
R. pendulina of Roth (not pendula) is taken up by that writer on 
report, and can be of no authority ; and the only clear point in 
the history of Pallas 's R.
alpina in, as Mr. Lindley justly deter- 
mines, that it is different from the Linnsean plant, so well 
known in Switzerland, as n.
1107 of Haller.
The account of 
R. rubella in English Botany, is, I believe, correct.
The authentic specimen of R.
pimpinellifolia, marked A, in the 
Linnaean herbarium, has smooth flower-stalks, and a globose 
smooth calyx-tube, without a neck.
It cannot therefore belong, 
as Mr. Woods suspected, to this species, but is truly the fol- 
lowing, under which I shall give its history.
The prickly, or 
rather perhaps bristly -stalked variety of spinosissima quoted in 
Fl. Br.
from Withering, should seem by that character to belong 
to rubella, but this is contradicted by Mr. Winch, Geogr.

Shrub.

Of the same stature as the last, but the prickles on the stem are 
much more abundant, and very unequal, straight, though often 
deflexed, oblong at the base.
A few bristles are interspersed, 
differing from the prickles in their smaller size and glandular 
tips only.
Leaflets usually 7, sometimes 9, smooth, opaque, 
almost orbicular, with broad simple serratures, which are 
largest towards the abrupt extremity, and very rarely here and 
there notched, or double, especially in luxuriant plants, whose 
leaflets are larger and more elliptical.
Comtnon footstalks more 
or less beset witli small glandular bristles ; sometimes prickly.
Stipulas linear-wedge-shaped, fringed with glands ; their points 
dilated, widely spreading, leafy, acute, often cut or lobed ; the 
upper ones never, as far as I have seen, assuming the appear- 
ance of bracfeas.
Flower-stalks solitary, varying in length, 
swelling upwards, angular when dried, quite smooth and 
riaked, according to my observation ; but some of Mr. Borrer's 
Sussex specimens have bristly flower-stalks, like Mr. Woods's 
spinosissima e.
Tube of the calyx very smooth, globose, often 
abrupt or flat at the top ; segments of the limb almost invari- 
ably simple, spreading ; smooth at the back ; acute, or slightly 
leafy, at the point; converging more or less as the fruit ripens.
Petah cream-coloured, yellow at the base, delicately fragrant ; 
in /3 striped, or copiously blotched, with red.

have never tasted it.
VV^ithering records that the juice, " di- 
luted with water, dyes silk and muslin of a peach colour, and 
with the addition of alum, a deep violet j bat it has very little 
effect on woollen or linen." 
Such is our native plant, whose garden or foreign varieties are not 
the object of this work.
They are ably explained by Mr. Sabine.
The herbarium of Linnaeus contains no original or authentic spe- 
cimen, marked or numbered by himself.
What bears this name 
is a paper of several specimens, sent by a French correspondent, 
and marked by Linnaeus pimplnellifolia , but to which I have put 
the name spi)iosis!>ima; and to this Mr. Woods adverts, as the 
true English plant; Liwt.

It is not however in itself 
of any authority, though unquestionably the same species with 
another specimen, of more importance, as being the only cer- 
tain authority for R.
pimjnneUifoUa, and this last is sufficiently 
perfect to decide any question, notwithstanding the stem being 
stripped of its prickles, an accident often happening to the spi«o- 
sissima, in exposed situations, as Mr. Woods truly remarks.
Whatever might be the original sphiosissima of Linnaeus, though 
its synonyms preclude all doubt, and the cinnamoniea seems to 
me out of the question, as he has recorded that the ripe fruit of 
his spinosissima is black ; he certainly did not recognise it in 
this specimen, nor even advert to it, as at all related thereunto.
He described this identical specimen, by the name of pimpinelii- 
folia, which he has written upon it, subjoining the letter A, 
by which the species is distinguished in Syst.
Nat. ed.
10.
v. 2.
1062 ; according to his practice in that edition, to avoid disturb- 
ing the numbers of the older species.
This luckily establishes 
the authority of the specimen beyond all question.
The plant 
was subsequently received into the 2d edition of Sp. Plant., but 
Linnaeus knew not from whence it came, and still less was he 
aware of its being precisely his R.
spinosLisima of the 1st edition 
of that work.
This name being the original one, and peculiarly 
appropriate, I cannot comply with Mr. Sabine's suggestion of 
changing it, however unwilling to differ, in any point, from so 
able and candid a friend.
I must also beg leave to observe 
that neither Willdenow, Miller, nor Jacquin, however meri- 
torious, are of any authority in this case ; except that, if their 
R. pimplnellifolia were specifically distinct, this name might re- 
main with it, as being very descriptive.

This great botanist however does not quote Caspar Bau-

characterized by its long elliptical leaflets, and very large, droop-

with the narrow, simple, involute calyx, is not found wild in 
England.

Mr. Sowerby,

Tube of the calyx unequally 
globose and rather depressed,besprinkled with strong glandular 
bristles, becoming a large, irregularly globose, or slightly pear-

let.
The segments of the calyx are always, as far as I have seen, 
in some degree compound, though far less copiously pinnate than 
in R.
tomentosa ; they are densely prickly and glandular at the 
back, downy in the upper part, and stand nearly upright on the 
fruit, which they greatly exceed in length.
Petals of a fine, 
rather deep, and mostly uniform red, or pink colour.
The rounded soft and hoary leaflets, and large globular, by no 
means elliptical, or ovate, yrai^, crowned by the very long, per- 
manent, tawny divisions of the calyx, characterize this species, 
though one of the latter is never free from an accessory leaflet 
or two.
The perfectly straight radical shoots are said by Mr.
Lindley and Mr. Sabine to aftbrd a permanent mark of distinc- 
tion between this and the following species.
I think with Mr.
Woods that this is the R.
villosa of the Linnaean herbarium, and 
the specimen there preserved proves, by an inscription at the back, 
which escaped his notice, to be what Osbeck gathered in Suder- 
mannia.
Linnseus in his Sp. PI.
no doubt confounded this plant 
with the Great Apple-bearing Rose of the gardens, of which I have 
already spoken under n.
6, R.
gracilis.
Ray might originally 
confound our present villosa with that, which should in future be 
called pomifera.
So might Haller under his n.
1 105, and so un- 
questionably did Hudson and Lightfoot imder i\\e\r villosa.
I have 
done the same in Fl. Brit., and am now happy to correct my 
error, hoping that some botanist will ascertain the native coun- 
try oi R.
pomifera, and whether it grows near Basil, or Mont- 
pellier, as John Bauhin records ; though in his mention of the 
latter station, near the famous hortus Dei, he describes the fruit 
as only the size of a hazel-nut, while his figure is certainly the 
pomifera.
R. villosa, Fl. Dan.
t. 1458, is evidently pomifera, 
though the leaflets are rather too acute.
Lightfoot's description, 
to which Mr. Woods adverts, Tr. of L.
Soc. v.

festly copied from Haller, see his w.
1105 ; and only shows that 
the latter, as well possibly as Lightfoot himself, had R.

in contemplation.

\n hedges on the north side of 
Bury St. Edmund's, Suffolk, 1804.
Shrub.
June, July.
Stem 6 feet high or more, branching, bushy, with round, brownish, 
leafy, prickly, but otherwise smooth and naked, branches.
Prickles often two near together under the insertion of each leaf, 
besides a few scattered solitary ones, all slender and awl-shaped, 
in some degree curved, but with no very great dilatation at the 
base ; nor are they compressed and sickle-shaped, like the spe- 
cies of the next section.
Leaflets 5 or 7, ovate, or slightly el- 
liptical, most acute at the extremity, and somewhat pointed ; 
their serratures double, acute and glandular ; both surfaces 
usually hoary, soft and downy, with a slight resinous scent, the 
under one more or less glandular.
Footstalks downy, sometimes 
beset with many hooked prickles, as well as with copious glan- 
dular bristles.
Slipulas linear, downy, with a dense glandular 
fringe ; the uppermost becoming broad, ovate, pointed bracteas.
Flower-stalks usually 2 or 3, often solitary, seldom 4, longer or 
shorter than the bracteas, clothed plentifully with glandular 
bristles of various lengths.
Tube of the calyx elliptic-oblong, 
sometimes almost globular, generally covered irregularly with 
glandular bristles, which are most crowded about the base j but

occasionally it is quite smooth.
Two segments of the very 
bristly limb, and one side of a third, copiously pinnate, with long, 
leafy, acute, toothed and glandular leaflets, as abundant as in 
any species whatever.
PetoZ* light red, white in their lower half ; 
sometimes white blotched with red.
Fruit scarlet, generally 
bristly, broadly elliptical, retaining the limb of the calyx, either 
spreading or reflexed, till quite ripe, when the latter usually 
falls off.
jS appears at first sight a very distinct species, whose leaves are 
greener, and more harsh, nearly smooth except the ribs, which 
are hairy.
Such at least is ray Suffolk plant, first noticed in 
company with Sir T.
Cullum and Mr. Crowe, the calyx-tubs of 
which is remarkably slender.
This 1 had in view in the descrip- 
tion of Engl.
Bot., though the figure was drawn from a plant of 
Mr.Winch's, then considered the same.
The latter has a rounder 
calyx-tube, and the Icajlets, except their ribs, are quite smooth.
Another specimen from this gentleman precisely accords with 
those from Bury ; while Mr. Woods describes those he received 
from Mr. Winch as " hoary with a velvety down, and exceed- 
ingly soft on both sides ; perhaps even more so than is usual in 
any other species." So 1 find them, 'and these therefore can 
only belong to R.
tomentosa.
They prove how liable its pubes- 
cence is to vary.
R. tomentosa was originally detected in the neighbourhood of Nor- 
wich about 45 years ago, and first published in Fl. Brit, under 
that name, which Mr. Lindley has very properly retained, in 
spite of the doubtful claim of a far less applicable one, of Ger- 
man origin, mollissima.
John Bauhin's synonym, though of late 
neglected, cannot be disputed.
Mr. Woods enumerates l.'i varieties, or different appearances, of 
this species, two of which I venture to refer to the following.
To the rest I could add several, for 1 have seen this plant, on 
removal to a rich and damp garden, assume so rank and prickly 
a habit, as to be scarcely recognised, and even in its various 
wild situations the pubescence varies greatly.
Still 1 find no con- 
siderable alteration in the divisions of the calyx, nor in the el- 
liptical shape of its tube.

Shrub.
June, July.
A stronger plant than the last, with stout round branches.
Prickles 
chiefly in couples under the leaves and younger branches, hooked, 
conical, tapering gradually from a very broad base, all in some 
degree compressed laterally, but particularly so on the young 
vigorous shoots.
Leaflets 5 or 7, elliptical and rather broad, 
but more or less acute at each end ; hoary soft and downy on 
both sides ; doubly serrated.
Footstalks downy, prickly, slightly 
glandular.
Stipulas downy, acute, fringed with glands.
Flower- 
stalks from 1 to 8 or 9, the more numerous the shorter, beset 
with glandular bristles, mostly bractcated with the uppermost 
leafless stipulas, which are ovate-lanceolate, acute, glandular and 
downy.
Tube of the culyx large, tumid, globose, abrupt, often 
slightly depressed, sometimes a little elongated at the base ; va- 
riously besprinkled with bristles, but sometimes almost naked, 
as Sherard and the late Mr. H.
Davies observed.
In a half-ripe 
state its surface is corrugated, from the projection of the nume- 
rous seeds, and has a purplish-olive hue.
It then much resem- 
bles a half-grown Bullace Plum.
1 have not seen the ripe hip, 
nor ihejlowers.
The segments of the limb of the calyx are ex- 
panded, tawny, very rough with bristles or stalked glands, and 
copiously pinnate in the manner of R.
tomentosa.
The whole 
plant, except the prickles and calyx, bears more resemblance to- 
villosa than tomentosa, and is particularly remarkable for its large 
globular half-ripe /r!«(7.
Whether it may be entitled to rank as 
a species, must be determined by future inquiries, as we are 
still but learners in the specific characters of this genus,

In bushy places on a dry gravelly or chalky soil ; sometimes on 
sandy islands in small rivers, as between Norwich and Yarmouth.
Shrub.
June, July.
Stem bushy, erect, 4 or 5 feet high, with numerous, stout, compact, 
smooth, green branches, reddish when young.
Prickles of two 
kinds; the larger often in pairs as well as scattered, hooked, 
sharp, conical, compressed, light brown, with a very broad 
base ; smaller chiefly interspersed among the former, in great 
numbers, on tlie strong radical shoots, being much smaller and 
straighter, but still different from bristles, and scarcely observ- 
able on the flowering branches.
Leaflets 5 or 7, more elliptical 
than ovate, rather acute, of a bright pleasant green, bordered 
with double glandular serratures ; the upper surface minutely 
hairy ; under covered with reddish viscid glands, from which prin- 
cipally exhales that peculiar fragrant scent, compared to apples, 
but much more generally agreeable.
For the sake of this scent 
the plant is often forced, anJ- is very grateful, without being 
oppressive, in close apartments ; but it is most delightful in 
hedges and shrubberies.
Footstalks downy, glandular, with se- 
veral hooked prickles, and, 1 think, some bristles.
Stipulas 
linear-lanceolate, pointed, closely and uniformly fringed with 
glands, such as are often found likewise on their under side 
near the extremity ; the upper ones changing to ovate, pointed 
bracteas.
Flower-stalks generally from 1 to 3, sometimes much 
more numerous, clothed Mith long, slender, unequal, glandu- 
lar bristles, some of which, as Mr. AVoods remarks, assume the 
fonii of slender curved prickles, destitute of glands.
Tube of 
the calyx elliptical, tinged with red, irregularly bristly ; segments 
of the limb more copiously pinnate than is shown in Engl.
Bot., 
their divisions distantly toothed and glandular.
Petals bright 
pink.
Fruit scarlet, mealy and insipid, more or less bristly, espe- 
cially about the base, its form obovate, occasionally nearly ellip- 
tical, crowned with the withered segments of the calyx, which 
however are partly deciduous.
Mr. Woods observes that the 
earliest hip is always obovate, though some of the later ones 
may assume an elliptical shape.
Mr. Woods's variety 5, with curved but not hooked prickles, and 
smaller, sometimes rounder, leaflets, agrees very nearly with 
Mr. Lindley's g" rotundifolia, first published by Rau, which 
I have from Nuremberg.
The tube of the calyx, even in 
Mr. Woods's own specimens, appears to me as bristly at the 
base as in our common Sweet Briar.

I cannot but prefer the name ruUginosa for this species, because 
it is certainly what Linnaeus so denominated, tliough lie origi- 
nally confounded the synonyms of this plant with the Yellow 
Briar, his R.
Eglanteria.
But in the 2d editions of Sp. PL and 
Fl. Suec.
his Eglanteria is determined by its yellow flowers, and 
all the specimens in his herbarium marked Eglanteria are the 
Yellow Briar, of which the Austrian Rose, R.

is a very transient variety.
Linnaeus was first 
made aware of his error by his correspondent Mygind, who 
sent him the rnbiginosa ; and this Iletzius asserts to be the 
Swedish plant, Prodr.
Fl. Scandinav.
120, 121, the Neglantyr 
of the Swedes.
Linnaeus could surely never have seen it wild.
Whether R.
suaveolens of I'ursh be our ruhiginosa, does not con- 
cern the British botanist.
Mr. Lindley is decidedly of this opi- 
nion, but what Dr. Bigelow has sent me from Boston, North 
America, appears distinct.
A careful comparison of living spe- 
cimens may hereafter decide the question.
The specimens of Schleicher, described by me as R.
montana of 
Villars, in Rees's Cijdoptedia, and idluded to by Mr. Lindley, 
Ros. 1 15, are sufficiently ample and perfect, wanting only the 
petals, to prove them distinct from rnbiginosa, the leci/iels being 
quite smooth in eveiy part, and rather glaucous beneath.

Branches much more weak and slender than in the last.
Prickles 
fewer, either solitary or in pairs under the leaves and ^oung 
branches, rarely in any other part ; nor are there any smaller 
and straighter ones interspersed.
Leafets broadly ovate, acute, 
of a rather deeper green than in R.
rnbiginosa, and less rusty, 
though glandular, beneath.
They are also far less fragrant, as 
the cultivators of Sweet Briar well know ; but Mr. Woods says 
this circumstance is variable.
Indeed nothing is more so than 
the scent of aromatic plants, according to tlie different states of 
the atmosphere.
Flowers light red, usually small, but this 
mark also is said to be variable.
Tube of the calyv ovate, with 
a contracted cylindrical neck, its surface in some degree bristly, 
especiallv at the base, though, as Mr. Woods remarks, the

prickles thereabouts are not so long a6 in rubiglnosa ; segments 
of the limb not very much pinnate, falling off as the fruit ripens.
The latter is scarlet, sometimes quite smootli, retaining its 
oval foim, with a short neck, and commonly much smaller than 
the hips oi ruhiginosa .
Mr. Lindley, partly as it seems at the persuasion of Mr. Lyell, 
makes this a variety of the last ; but Mr. Borrer, Mr. Sabine 
and Mr. Woods agree with me in keeping it distinct.
Till we 
have more experience in the specific characters of this genus, 
as no one can be competent, in difficult cases, to comi; to an ab- 
solute conclusion, it is safer to discriminate than to confound.

A compact bush, about 4 or 5 feet high, remarkable for the very

The 
stem and main branches are of a purplish brown, smooth, fur-

der the leaves and young shoots, each prickle having an oblong- 
elliptical base, often longer than itself.
Leaflets .5 or 7, elliptical,

of the calyx deciduous ; fni'U elliptical, probably red.
Dr. Afzelius publishes his plant as indubitably a distinct species 
from canina, and that it is so I think none can doubt, unless, 
like the French botanist Gerard, we reduce the v.'hole genus 
of Rosa to one species.
Dr. Swartz sent the same as R.

I do not perceive any remarkable difference between Mr. Woods's

don, and indeed throughout England.
His a, or sup!)osed type 
of the species, is R.
collina, Jacq.
Justr.
t. 197, which, by a spe- 
cimen from the author, appears distinctly characterized by its 
dense habit, hy'\.?,\\y flower-stalks, very hairy styles, and rounded 
leaflets.
This latter has not been gathered in Britain.
Finding 
myself obliged to separate it from the plant Mr. Woods has de- 
scribed, I gladly concur with Mr. Sabine in giving Mr. Forster's 
name to what thus becomes a new species, totally different in 
the simple and naked, not glandular, serratures of its leaves 
from all the preceding, principally R.
Borreri, which it other- 
wise resembles ; and from R.
canina in its hairy mid-rib.
Whether any other characters may be discovered betwixt R.
For- 
steri and canina, on a comparison of living specimens, must 
for the present be left in doubt ; for there are many particulars, 
concerning several of our most common Roses, that still re- 
quire investigation.
Of Mr. Woods's S, an elegant little plant, with small pointed 
leaflets, I have only^een one dried specimen, which answers to 
the above specific character.

distinction.
Shrub.
June — November.
A compact bush, from 3 to 6 feet high, copiously branched, and 
very prickly.
It has much of the habit and characters of the 
first section of the genus, and some of its smaller prickhs look 
very like bristles ; but they are not glandular nor quite straight.
The curvature of all the prickles indeed is but slight, though the 
larger ones are sufficiently hooked, as well as compressed, to 
entitle the plant to a place in our third section, being moreover 
allied to several neighbouring species.
Leaflets 5 or 7, smaller 
than most of this section, elliptical or roundish, acute, strongly, 
sharply, and rather unequally, but by no means doubly, ser- 
rated, quite destitute of glands ; the upper surface a little glau- 
cousj rarely besprinkled with fine longish hairs ; under smooth, 
except the ribs, which bear plenty of white hairs, unequal in 
length and direction.
Footstalks hairy and in some instances 
prickly, not glandular.
Stipulas smooth, dilated upwards, mi- 
nutely serrated, with spreading points ; the uppermost often 
changed for smooth, ovate, pointed, slightly serrated bracteas.
Tube of the calyx globular, very smooth ; segments of the limli 
pinnate, with a few linear-lanceolate, entire leaflets, neither 
cut nor glandular.
Flowers rather small, of a light blush-co- 
lour.
Floral receptacle very flat.
Styles distinct.
Fruit orange- 
coloured, roundish-ovate, sometimes almost exactly globular, 
crowned with the upright permanent segments of the calyx, about 
its ov.'n length.

their base large, much elongated and flattened.
Leaflets 7, large, 
elliptical, with a small twisted point more or less apparent, 
sharply and simply, though often unequally serrated, and not 
glandular ; perfectly smooth in every part ; the upper surface 
deep green, either opaque or very shining; under paler.
Foot-

slightly hairy, rarely bristly or glandular.
Stipulas linear, taper-

times very slight.

Floicer -stalks from I to 4, or many more, ac- 
cording to the strength of the shoot or branches, for the most 
part smooth, but sometimes furnished with weak glandular 
bristles as well as the elliptical tube, and simply pinnate seg- 
ments, of the calyx, though both the latter are usually smooth.
Flowers of various shades of pink, large, fragrant and beautiful j 
seldom quite white.
Floral receptacle small and flat.
Stijles 
slightly prominent.
Fruit ovate, stripped of the segments of 
the calyx, bright scarlet, of a peculiar and very grateful flavour 
when ripe, especially if made into a conserve with sugar.
How 
far any of our other Roses, hitherto confounded with this, par- 
take of the same flavour, I have not had the means of knowing, 
but this much concerns those who prepare Conserve of Hips.
I have often been sensible of a great diversity of flavour in these 
fruits, casually gathered late in autumn.
Var.
(3 differs in having remarkably strong shoots, bearing some- 
tiities great plenty of flowers ; but I agree with Mr. Sabine in 
thinking it a mere variety.
Most Roses, if cut down, send up 
such vigorous shoots the next season.
y is more doubtful, having the calyx-tube globose, and i\\& prickles 
nearly straight; but no safe judgment can be formed upon the 
only known specimen, gathered by Mr. Woods at Ambleside.
The wooden cut in Dodonasus, PemptASi't, named R.

Lady Monson.
It is described as very beautiful, having stout, 
erect stems, bearing large bunches of most elegant Jlowers.

Mr. Woods remarks that it is rare 
in the mountainous districts.
Common in Norfolk.
Shrub.
July.
A bush about 4 or 5 feet high, much more when supported, send- 
ing forth abundance of trailing, glaucous, often mahogany- 
coloured, arching branches, many feet in length.
Prickles all 
scattered, not in pairs, strongly hooked, smaller than those of 
R. canina.
Leajlets 5, rarely 7, elliptic-oblong, acute, simply, 
though sometimes unequally, serrated, generally smooth on both 
sides ; glaucous beneath, where the ribs are often hairy.
Foolsfalks prickly, finely hairy as well as minutely glandular.
Stipulas linear, acute, narrow, glandular at the margins.
Brac- 
teas similar, linear-lanceolate.
Fl. rarely solitary, generally 
from 3 to 5 together, rather concave, slightly scented, white 
and very elegant ; the buds frequently blush-coloured.
Flower- 
stalks often dark red, rough with numerous short glandular 
bristles.
Tube of the calyx elliptic-oblong, glaucous, partly 
reddish, smooth, rarely glandular ; segments smooth or some- 
what glandular, pinnate, with lanceolate smooth leaflets.
Flo- 
ral receptacle convex, but not conical, nor so prominent as in 
R. systyla, though the styles are much longer, united, as in that, 
into a stout furrowed column, destitute of hairs, which is not 
the case with any other British Rose, except the last, and 
crowned by the smooth stigmas, crowded, and partly combined, 
into a round head.
Fruit of a dark blood-colour, usually, as 
far as I have seen, globular and smooth.
Mr. Woods describes 
it as in general elliptic-oblong, at least where the stalks are 
aggregfvte.
He highly commends its flavour, as well as that of 
R. systyla.
I have never perceived any specific diff"erence between R.
arvensis 
and the Ayrshire Rose, now so frequently cultivated.
The latter 
has been proved by Mr. Sabine's accurate inquiries, see Tr. of

not belong to the present subject, any more than R.
sempervirens, 
now and then confounded with both ; but which, unless I am 
greatly mistaken, may always be known, besides other marks, 
by its very hairy styles.
The eminently beautiful Rose, suspected by Mr. Sabine to be a 
double blush-coloured variety oi arvensis, called in the Nurseries 
round London the " Double Hip Rose," and mentioned by 
Mr. Woods and Mr. Lindley, has not only a very different aspect, 
but likewise different characters, approaching R.
gallica and its 
allies, with which it nearly agrees in magnitude.
The branches 
are really furnished, like those species, with glandular bristles, 
as in my first section, and the subdivisions of the calyx bear 
long, tawny, marginal hairs.
The styles I have not been able 
to examine, but Mr. Lindley says they are not united, a most 
essential distinction !
I cannot but concur with him in think- 
ing this plant the offspring of some of the common garden 
Roses, whether by the pollen of R.
arvensis, which it a[)proaches 
rather in general external similitude than in any one character, 
I greatly doubt.
Mr. Sabine informs me the original plant was 
found in Devonshire ; and I am also indebted to this gentleman 
for the account of another remarkable variety, of a stout habit, 
with very large pale-flesh-coloured petals, found wild in a hedge 
in Somersetshire, by our much-lamented friend Mr. George An- 
derson, a most faithful and intelligent observer.
This is now 
known to cultivators by the name of R.
arvensis Andersonii.
The Swedes have not R.
arvensis, nor do they in general seem to 
know it.
Linnaeus adopted it, apparently without a specimen, 
from Hudson ; and my very correct friend Dr. Afzelius thinks 
it was afterwards confounded with something else.
Fl. Dan.
t. 398, certainly a different species from arvensis, is referred by 
Dr. Afzelius to piinpuieUifolia, under which, as spinosissimn, see 
n. 3, I have quoted that figure.

Shrub.
July, August.
Stems truly shrubby, of a dark red or purple, strongly angular, 
with intermediate furrows, many feet in length, tough and 
woody, biennial, if not perennial, flowering the second year, 
branched, leafy ; the barren ones smooth, arched, and some- 
times taking root at the extremity; the others erect, and 
slightly downy at the upper part.
Prickles numerous on the 
angles of the stems, sharp and strongly hooked, reddish.
Leaves firm and durable, almost evergreen, of 5 ovate-oblong, 
acute, or pointed, sharply and unequally serrated leajlets; which 
are dark green, smooth, or slightly hairy above ; snow-white, 
finely downy, and strongly veined, with a prickly rib, beneath ; 
the terminal one largest, with a long partial stalk ; 2 next with 
much shorter partial stalks, each of which bears a considerably 
smaller, nearly sessile, leaflet, so that the whole leaf is strictly 
pedate, the uppermost on the flowering stems only being ter- 
nate, or even simple.
On the same branch are sometimes seen 
a few leaves that are pale green at the back, and merely hairy, 
not at all cottony, or white.
Footstalks in some degree hairy, 
all beset with strongly hooked prickles.
Stipulas bristle-shaped, 
hairy, in pairs upon each footstalk near the base.
Clusters erect, 
oblong, rather densely panicled, twice compound, many- 
flowered ; their branches and stalks rather angular, white, and 
finely downy, without glandular hairs.
Bracteas solitary, linear- 
lanceolate, white or hoary.
Fl. erect, handsome.
Cuhjx downy 
all over, reflexed in the flower, as well as in fruit, destitute of 
prickles, and of glandular hairs.
Petals of a delicate pink, 
rarely if ever white.
The excellent authors of the " Rubi Ger- 
viaitici," on the contrary, find them generally white.
Stamens 
red.
Berry nearly globular, of very numerous purplish-black, 
smooth juicy grains, of a sweet but mawkish flavour, ripened 
late in autumn.
Several reputed varieties of this species, almost equally common, 
have been observed in Britain, differing in the shape and pu- 
bescence of their lecifiets, not to mention other characters.
These have recently been proposed as species, in a very able 
work, with excellent plates partially coloured, by Dr. A.
Weihe 
and Professor Ch. G.
Nees ab Esenbeck, of Bonn, under the title 
of Ruhi Germanici.
Some of them were sent me from Shroj)- 
shire by the Rev. E.
Williams in 1801 , and others have been no- 
ticed, long since, by Mr. E.
Forster, Mr. Borrcr and Mr. Bicheno, 
who have all favoured me with specimens accompanied by valuable 
remarks as usual.
Mr. Thomas Furly Forster has also been long 
attentive to the same subject.
Mr. Bicheno recommends a new 
arrangement of all the species of this genus, which is here nearly 
adopted.

Stems angular, with slight intermediate furrows, more or less va- 
riegated with blue, either smooth or minutely hairy ; the barren 
ones arched, many feet in length, described by Weihe as often 
taking root at the extremity.
Prickles variously scattered, 
chiefly on the angles of the stem, reddish, or purple, pointing 
downwards, but more slender, narrower at the base, and less 
hooked than in R.
fruticosus, or even plicatus ; except those of 
the footstalks and ribs of the leaflets, which are all hooked, or 
sickle-shaped, as in those species.
Leaves of the barren stems, 
and great part of the fertile ones, of 5 leaflets ; upper ones 
upon the latter of 3 ; the topmost simple ; the central leaflet 
on a very long prickly partial-stalk, the rest on short ones, of 
which the 2 lateral are sometimes combined : leaflets large, flat, 
pointed, sharply and copiously serrated ; bright green and 
nearly smooth above ; downy and hoary, with shining white 
hairs interspersed, beneath, but not pure white and cottony as 
in R.
fruticosus ; their shape is obovate, often doubly serrated, 
but in the ternate ones more orbicular, with nearly uniform and 
simple serratures ; in /3 they are somewhat broader, and heart- 
shaped at the base, but I can find no other difference in any 
part whatever of the two plants.
Stipulas linear-lanceolate.
Panicle oblong, twice or thrice compound, somewhat leafy, 
hairy and prickly, the partial stalks round, densely downy, 
hoary; not snow-white and angular like those of the first spe- 
cies, nor do they bear prominent glandular hairs, like many of 
the following.
Bracteas linear-lanceolate.
Fl. white, or purplish.
Calyx spreading, not closely reflexed even when in fruit ; its

cimen I have seen, Fruit black, of not very numerous grains.
In one of Mr. Forster's specimens the upper leaflets of the flowering 
stem are almost lanceolate, but this seems of rare occurrence.
The authors of the Rubi Germanici suspect t.7l5 of Engl.
Bot. to 
belong to this species.
I have no specimen of the identical

broad hooked red prickles, certainly rather indicate the true

Mr. Borrer observes that this species " rivals the fruticosus and 
rhamnifolius in size, and resembles them in mode of growth ; 
but is readily dl'^tinguishable by its abundant shaggy and 
shining pubescence, and narrow cluster or panicle.
The leaves 
also are generally more jagged, and even the old stems are 
rarely without hairs.
The shoots are angular, scarcely fur- 
rowed." All the specimens I have seen confirm this account.
One of them was received by Mr. E.
Forster from a well-known 
Swiss botanist, Mr. Schleicher, under the above name.
What 
I find peculiar in this species are the abundant little glands, 
sessile or somewhat stalked, scattered over the branches and 
stalks of the long, narrow, cylindrical panicle, as well as the 
outside of the calyx, but seldom projecting so far as the copious 
hairs of those parts.
The calyx moreover is destitute of prickles, 
except a few short ones occasionally at the very base.
Petals 
white or pale red.
Fruit globular, black.
This species is sometimes found, by Mr. Borrer, with heart-shaped 
lea/lets, which may further justify my referring cordifolius to 
rhamnifolius.

The barren shoots of this species, which neither Dr. Bellardi, nor 
Professor DeCandoUe, perhaps, has examined, bear leaves with 
:> ovate, acute, stalked leaflets; tliose eminent botanists de- 
scribe the leaves as all ternate, which is the case with those of 
the flowering stems only.
All the stems are angular, furrowed 
towards the top, and, as Mr. Boner observes, " nearly as stout 
at the base as those of R.fruticosus, but not so tall." All are 
copiously beset with scattered, unequal, deflexed, partly hooked 
prickles, and in the upper part with glandular bristles.
The 
prickles of the footstalks and ribs of the leaves are plentiful, 
and strongly hooked.
Leaflets on the flowering stems rather 
obovate, and more jagged ; all the leaflets are bright green 
and smooth above ; paler and downy beneath, but not hoary 
except when very young.
Stipulas very narrow.
Panicle some- 
what corymbose, not elongated ; its lower branches spreading 
horizontally ; all the general as well as partial stalks are 
clothed with numerous, partly hooked prickles, abundance of 
shaggy hairs, and of straight, unequal, glandular-tipped, viscid 
bristles.
The calyx is also hairy, copiously glandular, and more 
or less armed with straight prickles.
The last character, and 
the prominent glandular bristles of the branches, panicle and 
calyx, mark this species well, and prevent its being confounded 
with a-ny variety of the leucostachys, whose glands are minute, 
and sunk amongst its hoary pubescence.
The calyx of J?, glan- 
dulosus sometimes, when extremely prickly, terminates in leafy 
points.
Petals white, narrower than in any of the foregoing.
Fruit black, of numerous, rather small, grains; its calyx re- 
flexed.
My Swiss specimen, gathered by M.
Favrod, exactly accords witli 
our English ones in all the above marks.
Yet M.
Reynier, to 
whom it was sent, considered it as a variety of the (Common 
Raspberry, R.
Idceus, and wrote a history of it, to that efl'ect, for 
his Memoires on the Natural History of Switzerland, of whicii 
one volume only seems to have been published.
It is difficult to 
imagine the grounds on which his opinion could be founded.
My excellent friend Professor DeCandolle first determined the 
synonym of Bellardi, who quotes, with doubt, but perhaps justly, 
R. hybridus of Villars, Dauph.

The stems, as Mr. Anderson observes, are biennial, flowering the 
second year, and no more, like those of the Raspberry; they 
grow nearly upright, without any support, and are about 3 or 4 
feet high, bluntly angular, brittle, reddish, leafy, destitute of 
hairs, but armed with scattered, deflexed, scarcely hooked, 
prickles, much smaller than in any of the foregoing species, and 
generally not above a line or two long ; when larger they are 
dilated or elongated at the base.
The &ower'mgstems bear several 
lateral, alternate, spreading, simple or compound branches, 
whose leaves are ternate, the uppermost simple, each branch 
hairy, and more or less prickly, terminating in a long, simple, 
bracteated, hairy cluster of 10 or 12 large, white, upright 
powers.

recommended by Mr. Anderson as perhaps not unworthy of 
cultivation.
The foliage of this species is in one respect peculiar.
Some of 
the leaves on the barren stems, though generally of 5 leaflets, 
the 2 lowermost of which are quite sessile, are often furnished 
with a pair of similar small leaflets on the central stalk, below 
the terminal one, so that the whole leaf'xs partly digitate, partly 
pinnate, combining the foliage of the Bramble and the Rasp- 
berry.
The leaflets are all of a deep green, ovate, or heart- 
shaped, pointed, sharply serrated ,- quite smooth above ; paler, 
with hairy ribs and veins, beneath.
Stipulas linear-lanceolate.
Footstalks sparingly and minutely prickly.
I have confined my description entirely to British native specimens.
The R.
fastigiatus of Weihe and Nees agrees well with our 
plant, and those authors notice a near approach to the peculiar 
form of the leaves, " the middle leaflet being sometimes deeply 
divided into 3 parts." But they describe the fruit of " a deep 
shining black," which seems an essential difference ; and they 
most unaccountably refer the plant of Engl.
Bot. to their nitidus, 
to which I am very sure it bears very little relationship, that spe- 
cies having black berries, sharp strongly-hooked 'prickles, a com- 
pound pa«ic^e, and a great difference of habit.
My references to the Ruhi Germanici will be found not always to 
agree with the pages of that work, which, however excellent in 
more important particulars, is singularly erroneous in numerical 
matters ; nor does its synonymy on the whole seem so masterly 
as the plates and descriptions.
Pollich's description of R.fru- 
ticosus, so indiscriminately laboured, conveys no precise ideas 
to my mind of the present species, though the able writers just 
mentioned are of a different opinion.
I regret that their work 
goes no further at present than R.
tomentosus ; a curious spe- 
cies, not vet found in Britain, remarkable for the softness of its 
leaves.

Stems biennial ; the barren ones very long and trailing, unless 
accidentally supported, sometimes arching, glaucous and pur- 
plish ; green in the shade ; they are brittle and full of pith, ge- 
nerally with 5 slightly prominent angles, and besprinkled with 
copious, rather small, prickles, phiced without any order and 
not confined to the angles, all very nearly straight, though a 
little deflexed.
The flowering stems are round, more upright, 
not quite so prickly, throwing out abundance of young hairy 
leafy branches, terminating in nearly simple, coiymbose, hairy 
and downy panicles, which are armed with straight prickles, 
and besprinkled with sliort glandular bristles.
Leaves on the 
barren stems of 5 very large, broadly ovate, somewhat heart- 
shaped, pointed, sharply serrated leaflets, often precisely like 
hazel-leaves ; peculiarly soft and minutely hairy, for the most 
part, beneath, though Ehrhart's specimen is almost smooth ; the 
2 lowermost nearly or quite sessile ; the prickles of their/oo<- 
stalks and ribs moderately hooked : the leaves of the flowering 
branches are uniformly of 3 much smaller, more cut leaflets ; 
all light green and very soft, not white or hoary, at the back.
Stipulas and bracteas linear-lanceolate, often very narrow.

Cal. hoary and

than in R.
fruticosus, and of a browner black, ripened before 
that oi X\\e.
fruticosus and its allies.
The late Mr. G.Anderson, an excellent observer, found the barren 
stems of this species taking root at the extremity, as often as 
those of R.
fruticosus.
That this accident however is not very 
general in either, appears from the anxiety with which country 
nurses and quacks seek it out, in order to cure children of the 
whooping cough, by drawing them through the arch thus form- 
ed by the stem of a Bramble.
The glands on the calyx and 
flower-stalks of R.
corylifolius, though not hitherto noticed, di- 
htinguish it from fruticosus as essentially as the scattered 
straight prickles of the stem, or any other mark whatever.
These glands nearly agree witli R.

very prickly, is covered with similar projecting bristles, and its 
segments, which are considerably pointed, close over the ripe 
fruit, whose grains are few, large, juicy, black, with a fine glau- 
cous bloom, and very agreeably acid.
Seeds large, compressed, 
deeply pitted.
This is a variable species, often approaching some varieties of the 
last, and sometimes having 5 leciflets, as Mr. G.
Anderson re- 
cords under his account of the corylifolius, Tr. of L.
Soc. v.W.
220 ; while on the other hand, " small specimens occur in 
chalky thickets," as Mr. Borrer observes, " which at first sight 
strikingly resemble R.
saxatilis." These species are, neverthe- 
less, perfectly distinct.
Bohemian specimens of the R.
nemorosus of Hayne, sent by a 
learned and experienced traveller, Mr. Sieber, are certainly in 
part ccesius, though one of them approaches corylifolius, except 
having much smaller leaves, and angu]aT flowering-branches.

Root rather woody.
Herb of a light green, slightly downy or 
hairy, not hoary, throwing out a few very long, round, trail- 
ing runners, either naked or leafy, taking root at the extremity, 
where they, in the following spring, send up one or two simple 
herbaceous flowering stems, from 3 to 6 inches high, which are 
angular, slightly hairy, and often armed with a few small, weak, 
spreading prickles.
These stems bear 2 or 3 alternate, long- 
stalked, ternate, serrated or notched leaves, not unlike those of 
a Strawberry, the mode of growth of the two plants being also 
very similar.
Stipulas elliptic-oblong.
Panicle terminal, corym-

small, greenish-white Jlowers.
Cal. angular at the base ; its 
segments oblong, downy within, externally somewhat haiiy, 
but not at all prickly or glandular ; spreading in t\\eJlower ; in-

3 large crimson grains, agreeably acid, but not perfumed.
Seeds large, tumid, pitted, and elegantly wrinkled.
By the above description, it is evident that this species can never

Dr. Nestler of Strasburgh, a recent writer of great merit, 
has, in a Monograph on Potentilla, applied the name of 
bracteas to the 5 outer segments of the calyx, in these 
genera and their allies.
Mr. Seringue, and die present 
Mr. Haller, have done the same.
But bracteas belong 
properly to the inflorescence, not to the fructification ,- 
and these outer segments differ in no respect from the 
inner, except a more leafy texture, in which they exactly 
agree with the leaflets, or pimice, of the calyx-segments 
in Rosa, which it would be absurd to call bracteas, and 
which actually prove the parts in question not to be such.
Dr. Nestler moreover follows several recent botanists of 
high rank in denominating the seeds of these plants 
414 ICOSANDRIA— POLYGYNIA.
Fragaria.
dkenia ; for it seems the French school at present do 
not allow the existence of any naked seeds.
This is an 
old subject of dispute, and is chiefly a difference of words.
Every seed, though it may not have a jpericarp^ must be 
protected by an integument, which is its testa, or skin ; 
see Introd.
to Botany,/.
4 ; and in that sense indeed no 
seed is naked.
But the testa differs in texture and con- 
figuration, in plants which have a seed-vessel, as well as 
in others that have none.
I agree with those physiolo- 
gical botanists, of whom it is abundantly sufficient to 
name Linnaeus, Jussieu and Gsertner, who admit of 
naked seeds in Grasses, Umbellatce, the Didynamia Gy- 
mnospermia, and many others.

Root rather woody, blackish, with many fibres, and sending forth 
several long, trailing, hairy runners.
These fix themselves at in- 
tervals by fresh radicles, by which the plant is widely propagated.
Stems 4 or 5 inches high, erect, slightly leafy, clothed with soft 
spreading hairs ; panicled, or somewhat cymose, at the top.
Leaves mostly radical, on long channelled footstalks, which are 
rough with spreading hairs; 2 lateral leaflets unequal at the base.
Fl. erect ; their common stalks clothed with copious spreading 
hairs ; partial ones with erect, or close-pressed, silky pubescence.
This character, constant in dry as well as recent specimens, is 
expressed by apparent smoothness of these partial stalks, in the 
wooden cuts to which 1 have referred.
Fruit drooping, deep 
scarlet, gratefully acid and aromatic, esteemed by Linneeus very 
salutary for gouty constitutions.
But he seems to have conceived 
this opinion chiefly from observing the effect of Strawberries in 
removing tartar from the teeth.

Larger than the foregoing, and rather more hairy in every part.
The essential difference consists in the long, wide-spreading, or 
considerably deflexed, hairs of all the Jiower-stalks, as well as 
footstalks.
This is liable to no variation or uncertainty, when 
properly observed.
Ehrhart first used it for specific discrimina- 
tion, and has distinguished all the real species of Strawberry, 
which Linnfeus confounded, by analogous marks.
The Jlowers 
of F.
elatior are generally, but not always, imperfectly dioecious ; 
those on one plant having the stamens most effectual, whilst an- 
other bears the most complete pistils.
A garden variety, noticed 
in Rees's Cyclopcedia, is supposed always to bear perfect flowers ; 
but this is not generally the case with the cultivated plant.
The 
fruit is the true Hautboy, known by its larger size, dark hue, 
and peculiar musky flavour.
1 have never seen it wild.

I am greatly obliged to my friend Mr. Haller jun.
for correcting 
me on the subject of our British plant, always called Potentilla 
aurea, about which I have often had doubts.
His illustrious father, 
it seems, confounded our plant with verna.
So great an error 
may plead my excuse for mistaking it, as Linnaeus himself at 
one time did, for the Linnaean aurea, Haller's n.
1 122.
t. 21.

which my wild British specimens nearly resemble.
It is singular 
that some cultivated ones, vchose roots came from Ben Lawers, 
should have helped to verify, beyond all doubt, the synonym of 
Haenke, whose figure in Jacq.
Ic. Rar.
strikingly accords with 
them, being taken from a very luxuriant, if not a garden, plant.
P. alpestris is an extremely variable species ; but the entire 
bases of its wedge-shaped leaflets, and the deep wide segments 
of their upper part, destitute of the silvery margin of P.
aurea, 
are characteristic.
The stem is represented too short in Engl.
Bat., as Wahlenberg well remarks ; but the leaves are correct,

Potentilla.
Those in Fl. Dan.
are less exact.
I think however there can be 
no question about any of the synonyms given above.
Mr. Se- 
ringae is not happy in his representation of the leaflets, at least 
of his cultivated specimen.
In reply to a question of this gentleman, in his Mus. v.
1 .
73, I must 
observe that his P.
Halleri, so admirably delineated in Haller's 
Hist.
i. 21 ./.
4, is the original authority for P.
aurea, taken up 
by Linnaeus without seeing a specimen, as his manuscript shows.
In Sp. Fled.
1, he had referred Haller's plant to verna.
He 
long afterwards received from Seguier our present P.
alpistris, 
which he marked aurea, and this might well mislead me.
This 
specimen however he has no where described in his works.
Some others of the same species he confounded, like Haller, 
with verna.
I trust this manifold error will now be set at rest 
. by the establishment of P.
alpestris.
Nestler has altogether 
misled Prof.
Hooker respecting this and P.
opaca.

There is a confu- 
sion between the two works of Clusius, and his figure here in- 
dicated, reprinted in Gerarde, is taken by Dr. Nestler for a good 
representation of P.
opaca.
It is but just to observe that Lin- 
naeus was of the same opinion.
But the figure of Clusius to 
which Nestler refers as verna, has ternate leaves, and upright 
stems.
Haller quotes Quinquefolium tertiuin of Clusius for an 
acute-leaved variety of verna ; but this is certainly quite unlike 
our plant.
I need not here refer to supposed varieties of this 
species, which are described by various foreign writers, but not 
known in Britain, nor do I perceive that any extraordinary diffi- 
culties attend our verna.
In a garden it becomes very luxuriant, 
but the stems continue prostrate, and the outer segments of the 
calyx are either three-ribbed or not, on the same plant.
Dr. Nestler refers to Engel.

Root woody, blackish, subdivided at the cfown, and bearing nume- 
rous leaves during winter.
In spring it puts forth several re- 
cumbent, slender, branched, hairy, many-flowered stems.
Ra- 
dical leaves on long hdiwy footstalks, with a pair of small, linear, 
or awl-shaped, hsin-j st'ipulas at their base ; leaflets constantly 7, 
dark green, minutely granulated like the last, hairy, linear- 
wedge-shaped, or somewhat obovate, with a series of very nu- 
merous deep marginal serratures, the terminal one small, and 
the base of each leaflet only being narrow and entire ; stem- 
leaves, except the very lowermost, ternate, frequently opposite, 
and nearly sessile, with broader, sometimes cloven, stipulas, of 
which the uppermost of all are replaced by oblong entire bracteas.
Fl. numerous, on long, simple, solitary, axillary, or panicled and 
bracteated, downy, hairy stalks.
Cal. hairy, its outer segments 
linear and narrow, as long as the rest.
Pet. about the same 
length, bright yellow, orange-coloured towards the base.
Seeds 
more or less corrugated.
Concerning Mr. Haller's plant, published by him, with a figure, in 
the valuable work of Mr. Seringue, I am perfectly certain, having 
like himself received it, in various states, from our common friend 
the late Mr. Davall.
I cannot distinguish it from Jacquin's figure, 
and it is precisely the Scottish plant communicated by Mr. James 
Donn, which has long remained unchanged, increasing plenti- 
fully, in my garden.
The specimens in the Linnaean herbarium 
are less luxuriant, but certainly the same.
These might induce 
Linnaeus to quote the figure of Clusius, which I have now re- 
ferred to P.
verna.
The small size attributed to the plant of 
Clusius, its flowering in the early spring, and its being so very 
abundant by road sides, and in dry open places, in Hungary, 
lower Austria, &c., with some points in the description, alto- 
gether answer to verna, one of the most common plants on 
the continent.
Authors still appear not well acquainted with 
P. opaca, as they continue to speak of it as very near verna.
A 
comparison of their figures in Engl.
Bot., both very faithful, may 
at least prevent this mistake.

1 cannot understand by what rule this plant has been, by some

It is a perfect

it has entirely the habit of a Fragaria.
Ehrhart first removed 
it from thence, and I prefer his specific name, though not one of 
the most elegant, to Fragaria.
The latter would, indeed, be ad- 
missible if the plant were the only Fragaria ever described, and 
that genus were sunk in PotentiUa. 1 hope my fellow labourers

* 
Notwithstanding the scientific labours of Dr. Nestler, Mr. Haller 
jun., and Mr. Seringue, who, according to their several oppor- 
tunities, have greatly illustrated this subject, I perceive the whole 
genus of Potentilla still requires accurate revision, neither the 
Linnaean species, nor the synonyms of the earlier writers, being 
well understood.
The British ones, as far as hitherto observed, 
will now I trust be intelligible ; so that if any new species should 
be found, they may, by competent observers, be distinguished.

The distinction between this genus and the last certainly 
depends upon number, but the difference is obvious, and 
as constant as in any other similar instance, of which 
there are several universally adopted.
Schreber abo- 
lished Tormentilla, but retained Tillcea, Crassula, Rho~ 
diola, and many other such.
He is followed, though not 
quoted, by some recent writers hereafter indicated.
To 
follow up the question as it deserves would require a long 
and deep inquiry, nor is it to be settled by a hasty opi- 
nion.
Scopoli's argument that " a one-eyed man is no 
less a man," does not seem to me very apt or ingenious.
I would have concealed it, if I could, out of respect to 
ICOSANDRIA-POLYGYNIA.
Tormentilla.

its excellent author.
A young student, desirous of judg- 
ing on points like this, will do well to recollect that if 
numbei', or any other character, be used to discriminate 
genera otherwise apparently distinct, still no character is 
of itself in all cases absolute.
In Gentiana and many 
others, number is of no consequence at all, and will 
sometimes hardly distinguish species.
In Saxifraga a 
superior or inferior germen makes no generic difference, 
though in genei'al the most absolute of all characters.
Superficial and partial views are dangerous to science.
Ringent flowers, with 2 long and 2 short stamens, vary 
in many instances to a regular 5-cleft corolla, with 5 equal 
stamens.
But this will hardly be thought to set aside the 
natural orders of Vertlcillatt£ and Personatce^ or the class 
Didynamia of Linnaeus.

Perennial.
May — August.
Root of many stout brown fibres, astringent, and in some degree 
, aromatic, said to give an agreeable clove-like flavour to beer, 
and even to wine.
Stem 2 feet high, erect, round, rough and 
finely hairy ,• branched at the upper part, bearing several flowers.
Radical leaves on long stalks, interruptedly pinnate, somewhat 
lyrate, the odd leaflet rounded, often deeply 3-lobed ; stem- 
leaves ternate, stalked ; upper simple, 3-lobed, wedge-shaped ; 
all variously notched and serrated, grass-green, veiny, hairy.
Stipulas of the stem-leaves very large, rounded, lobed, serrated, 
leafy.
Fl. terminal, solitary, stalked ; commonly small, bright 
yellow, erect ; in /3 larger and more tawny, somewhat droop- 
ing.
Cal. spreading, reflexed as the fruit advances.
Seeds in an 
ovate head, numerous, ovate, downy, besides a few long coarse 
hairs about the summit, each tipped with a rigid, purplish, de- 
flexed aion or tail, which is quite smooth, ending in a small sharp 
hook.
In an early state this hook forms the curved part of the 
style, but the small portion above that part, always likewise, in

this species, smooth and naked, soon falls off with the stigma.
I 
do not find the economy of these organs clearly explained by 
authors.
The seeds, according to Gaertner, have only a simple 
pellicle, or membrane, within their hairy outermost coat, and the 
latter therefore cannot come under the denomination of any sort 
of seed-vessel.
The flowejs of Ehrhart's G.
intermedium are not, either in his spe- 
cimens or mine, much larger than the common urhanum, but 
they are of a tawny hue, and rather drooping.
The divisions of 
the leaves vary in both.
I have suspected this G.
intermedium 
might be a variety of rivale, caused by the pollen of urbarium ; 
but, on account of its general aspect, have removed it hither.
The styles seem to agree best with G.
rivale.
I have not seen 
the ripe seeds, which it would be desirable to examine.
I follow 
the opinion of Ehrhart in the synonyms attached to this variety, 
not having been able to verify them.

Herbage 
hairy, deep green.
Stem 8 to 12 inches high, slightly panicled, 
otherwise simple.
Radical leaves stalked ; their terminal lobe 
very large, rounded, lobed, and sharply crenate ; stem-leaves 
few, stalked, ternate or 3-lobed.
Stipulas of the latter ovate, 
acute, cut, purplish.
Fl. almost pendulous, singularly elegant, 
growing upright as the seeds ripen.
Cal. of a rich purplish 
brown, erect; subsequently reflexed.
Pe<.
erect, cloven, of a 
tawny brown, altogether peculiar.
Germen, and lowest part of 
the style, bearing several long hairs, above which are some 
shorter and glandular ones ; but a considerable space under 
the very strong and remarkable curvature is smooth.
Above the 
curvature is a rather long, very hairy portion, which falls off 
with the stigma, leaving a hook behind.
When compared before 
the fall of this part with more advanced specimens, the plant 
might be taken for two distinct species, and I have received it 
as such from a very skilful botanist.
Whatever the variety /3 of the foregoing species may be, that of 
the present, at least, is no hybrid, as I can vouch from experi- 
ence.
It is readily produced by transplanting the wild roots 
into a dry gravelly soil, by which the Jlowers become red, as well 
as double and proliferous, with many strange changes of leaves 
into petals, and the contrary.
This variation happens, not un- 
frequently, in mountainous countries.
The foreign species of Geum, montanum and reptans not excepted, 
require examination as to the structure and progress of their 
styles, which must decide whether they properly belong to this 
genus or the next.

One of the most elegant of alpine plants.
Roots strong and woody,

leafy stems.
Leaves evergreen, stalked, crowded, simple, ovate, 
near an inch long, obtuse, strongly, though bluntly, serrated ; 
convex, furrowed, smooth, of a deep shining green above ; snow- 
white and cottony, with a red rib, beneath.
Footstalks hairy, 
about as long as the leaves or longer, with a pair of long, awl- 
shaped, haiiy stipulas, united to the base of each.
Fl. large, so- 
litary, on long, terminal, hairy stalks.
Cal. for the most part in 
8 equal, uniform, cottony and bristly segments, sometimes 10, 
very rarely 6.
Pet. obovate, of a brilliant white, as many as the 
divisions of the calyx, with a strong disposition to exceed in 
number.
Styles densely feathery and silky, straight, without any 
joint or curvature, lengthened out as the flower fades into long 
feathery tails to the seeds, tipped with the more or less perma- 
nent, smooth, coloured stigmas.
It seems that the stigmas finally fall off, leaving the tails abrupt, 
but straight and unchanged, not hooked as in Geum.
There is 
indeed no apparent joint, or interruption, in the course of the 
style, and if the stigma breaks off, it is only, as in other innu- 
merable instances, because its functions are performed, and it 
becomes a dead part.
The beautiful Dryas pentapetala precisely 
agrees in these particulars with octopetala, and is therefore im- 
properly removed to Geum by Willdenow.

The very

It is difficult to 
conceive upon what principle Fragaria sterilis of Linnaeus 
could be referred to Comarum -, certainly by no natural 
or artificial character.
